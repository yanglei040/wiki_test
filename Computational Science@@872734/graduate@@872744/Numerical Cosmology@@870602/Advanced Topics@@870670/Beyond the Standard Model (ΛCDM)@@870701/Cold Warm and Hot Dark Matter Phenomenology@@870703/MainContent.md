## Introduction
Dark matter is the invisible scaffolding upon which the cosmic web is built, gravitationally driving the formation of every galaxy and cluster of galaxies we observe. The prevailing paradigm, Cold Dark Matter (CDM), has been remarkably successful on large scales, yet persistent discrepancies between its predictions and observations on small, galactic scales have opened the door to alternative theories. This creates a crucial knowledge gap: if not entirely cold, what is the 'temperature' of dark matter, and what are its observable consequences? This article addresses this question by exploring the phenomenology of Warm (WDM) and Hot (HDM) dark matter, which differ from CDM not in their fundamental nature, but in their primordial velocity.

We will first delve into the **Principles and Mechanisms** that define these dark matter categories, focusing on how [particle kinematics](@entry_id:159679) lead to the suppression of small-scale structures. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will examine the observational probes and theoretical modeling techniques used to test these theories against the real universe. Finally, a series of **Hands-On Practices** will allow you to apply these concepts through foundational calculations and an introduction to simulation methods. By exploring this phenomenological framework, we can transform subtle astrophysical measurements into powerful constraints on fundamental particle physics, beginning with the core principles that distinguish one dark matter 'temperature' from another.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The distinction between Cold, Warm, and Hot Dark Matter (CDM, WDM, and HDM) is not one of composition but of [kinematics](@entry_id:173318). The classification is fundamentally phenomenological, rooted in the [average velocity](@entry_id:267649) of the dark matter particles during the critical epoch of [cosmic structure formation](@entry_id:137761). This velocity determines the efficacy of a process known as **[free-streaming](@entry_id:159506)**, which directly imprints a characteristic signature on the distribution of matter in the Universe. In this chapter, we will explore the principles that define these dark matter categories, the mechanisms by which they influence cosmic structure, and the microphysical origins and observational consequences of their differing kinematic properties.

### Kinematic Classification of Dark Matter

The 'temperature' of a dark matter species refers to its random thermal motion. A particle's capacity to influence [structure formation](@entry_id:158241) depends on whether it is relativistic ($v \approx c$) or non-relativistic ($v \ll c$) at the time when [gravitational instability](@entry_id:160721) begins to amplify [density perturbations](@entry_id:159546) efficiently. This crucial milestone is the epoch of **[matter-radiation equality](@entry_id:161150)** at a [scale factor](@entry_id:157673) $a_{\mathrm{eq}}$, when the energy density of matter surpasses that of radiation, allowing matter perturbations to grow in earnest.

To formalize this, we consider a representative dark matter particle of mass $m$. Its kinematic state can be described by the dimensionless ratio of its physical momentum to its rest mass energy, $r(a) \equiv p(a)/m$ (in units where $c=1$). A particle is relativistic if $r(a) \gg 1$ and non-relativistic if $r(a) \ll 1$. The momentum of a particle that is no longer interacting with the primordial plasma (i.e., it has undergone **kinetic decoupling**) simply redshifts with the [expansion of the universe](@entry_id:160481), $p(a) \propto a^{-1}$. Therefore, its momentum at any [scale factor](@entry_id:157673) $a$ is related to its momentum $p_{\mathrm{kd}}$ at kinetic [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) ($a_{\mathrm{kd}}$) by $p(a) = p_{\mathrm{kd}} (a_{\mathrm{kd}}/a)$.

The classification of dark matter hinges on the value of $r(a)$ at the epoch of [matter-radiation equality](@entry_id:161150), $a_{\mathrm{eq}}$ [@problem_id:3467868].

*   **Cold Dark Matter (CDM)**: These particles are, by definition, already non-relativistic at the time of their kinetic decoupling. This corresponds to the condition $r_{\mathrm{kd}} \equiv p_{\mathrm{kd}}/m \ll 1$. Because they are "born cold," they remain slow-moving throughout all subsequent cosmic history. Their velocity at [matter-radiation equality](@entry_id:161150) is negligible, $r(a_{\mathrm{eq}}) \ll 1$, allowing them to clump together under gravity on all scales, forming the seeds for structures as small as the first star clusters and as large as galaxy clusters.

*   **Hot Dark Matter (HDM)**: These particles are ultra-relativistic at kinetic [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) ($r_{\mathrm{kd}} \gg 1$) and, crucially, remain relativistic until at or after [matter-radiation equality](@entry_id:161150). The condition for HDM is therefore $r(a_{\mathrm{eq}}) \gtrsim 1$. Since decoupling typically occurs deep in the radiation era ($a_{\mathrm{kd}} \ll a_{\mathrm{eq}}$), a particle must be extremely relativistic at decoupling to satisfy this condition. Massive neutrinos are the archetypal example of HDM. Their high speeds cause them to stream freely across vast cosmic distances, erasing primordial density fluctuations on all but the largest scales.

*   **Warm Dark Matter (WDM)**: This category represents the intermediate case. WDM particles are relativistic or semi-relativistic at kinetic decoupling ($r_{\mathrm{kd}} \gtrsim 1$) but become non-relativistic at some point *before* [matter-radiation equality](@entry_id:161150). This means they are moving slowly enough by the time structures begin to form ($r(a_{\mathrm{eq}}) \lesssim 1$) to allow for the gravitational collapse of large objects like galaxies, but their residual velocity is still significant enough to have erased the initial seeds for smaller structures like dwarf galaxies.

This phenomenological framework connects the microphysics of particle [decoupling](@entry_id:160890), which sets the initial momentum ratio $r_{\mathrm{kd}}$, to the macroscopic consequences for [structure formation](@entry_id:158241), which are determined by the kinematic state at $a_{\mathrm{eq}}$ [@problem_id:3467868].

### The Mechanism of Free-Streaming and Collisionless Damping

The physical process by which fast-moving particles erase small-scale structure is called **[free-streaming](@entry_id:159506)** or **[collisionless damping](@entry_id:144163)**. In the early universe, particles in an overdense region possess random thermal velocities. If these velocities are large enough, the particles can escape the shallow gravitational potential well of the overdensity before it has time to grow and collapse. By streaming from overdense to underdense regions, the particles smooth out the density field, effectively damping or erasing perturbations.

#### The Free-Streaming Horizon

The characteristic scale of this damping process can be quantified by the **comoving [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) horizon**, $\lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}$. This is the maximum [comoving distance](@entry_id:158059) a typical particle can travel from the early universe up to a given time. A particle with physical speed $\langle v(a') \rangle$ at [scale factor](@entry_id:157673) $a'$ travels a [comoving distance](@entry_id:158059) $d\chi = \frac{\langle v(a') \rangle}{a'} dt'$. Integrating this from an early time until a scale factor $a$ gives the horizon [@problem_id:3467905]:
$$ \lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}(a) = \int_0^a \frac{\langle v(a')\rangle}{a'^2 H(a')} da' $$
where we have used the relation $dt' = da'/(a'H(a'))$.

Density perturbations with comoving wavelengths $\lambda$ smaller than $\lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}$ are suppressed. The magnitude of this suppression depends on the evolution of $\langle v(a) \rangle$. For HDM, particles are relativistic ($\langle v \rangle \approx c$) until late times, resulting in a large $\lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}$ on the order of hundreds of Megaparsecs, wiping out all but supercluster-scale structures. For CDM, particles are always slow-moving ($\langle v \rangle \approx 0$), making $\lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}$ negligible; thus, no significant suppression occurs. WDM lies in between, with a $\lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}$ on the order of tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs, leading to the suppression of structures on the scale of dwarf galaxies [@problem_id:3467905].

#### The Vlasov-Boltzmann Picture

A more rigorous description of this phenomenon requires moving beyond simple fluid approximations and employing kinetic theory. The evolution of a collection of collisionless particles is governed by the **collisionless Boltzmann equation**, also known as the **Vlasov equation**, coupled to the Poisson equation for gravity. This equation describes the conservation of the one-particle [phase-space distribution](@entry_id:151304) function $f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}, t)$ along particle trajectories.

When we linearize this equation in Fourier space, we obtain a hierarchy of equations for the moments of the distribution function, typically expanded in Legendre polynomials $P_l(\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between the wavevector $\mathbf{k}$ and the particle momentum $\mathbf{p}$ [@problem_id:3467878]. The first few moments correspond to familiar fluid quantities: the monopole ($\Psi_0$) is the density perturbation, the dipole ($\Psi_1$) is the velocity divergence, and the quadrupole ($\Psi_2$) is the **[anisotropic stress](@entry_id:161403)**.

The Vlasov equation contains a term representing particle motion, $\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla f$, which in Fourier space becomes a coupling term proportional to $k$ times the particle speed. This term links each moment $\Psi_l$ to its neighbors $\Psi_{l-1}$ and $\Psi_{l+1}$.

*   For **CDM**, the particle velocity is zero. The coupling term vanishes, and the infinite hierarchy of equations is truncated. The only non-zero moments are density and velocity, and the [anisotropic stress](@entry_id:161403) is zero. This system is equivalent to the equations for a pressureless [perfect fluid](@entry_id:161909) (continuity and Euler equations). The growth of perturbations is independent of the scale $k$.

*   For **WDM and HDM**, the particle velocity is non-zero. The $k$-dependent coupling term is active, driving an infinite hierarchy. A density perturbation sources a [velocity field](@entry_id:271461), which through [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) sources an [anisotropic stress](@entry_id:161403), which sources higher moments, and so on. This transfer of power to higher moments represents the physical process of particles streaming out of a perturbation, and it is this mechanism that damps the growth of the initial density mode. This damping is more efficient on small scales (large $k$), giving rise to scale-dependent growth suppression [@problem_id:3467878].

### Impact on the Growth of Structure

The primary observable consequence of [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) is a suppression of power in the [linear matter power spectrum](@entry_id:751315), $P(k)$, on small scales (large $k$).

#### Power Spectrum Suppression: The Case of Massive Neutrinos

Massive neutrinos provide a clear illustration of how a Hot Dark Matter component affects [structure formation](@entry_id:158241). Let us consider a universe containing CDM, baryons, and a small fraction $f_\nu \equiv \Omega_\nu / \Omega_m$ of [massive neutrinos](@entry_id:751701). On scales much smaller than the [neutrino free-streaming](@entry_id:159273) scale ($k \gg k_{\mathrm{fs},\nu}$), the fast-moving neutrinos do not cluster, meaning their density perturbation is negligible: $\delta_\nu \approx 0$ [@problem_id:3467879].

The growth of the clustering component (CDM + [baryons](@entry_id:193732), denoted `cb`) is driven by the total [gravitational potential](@entry_id:160378), which is sourced by all matter perturbations:
$$ \ddot{\delta}_{\mathrm{cb}} + 2H\dot{\delta}_{\mathrm{cb}} = 4\pi G (\delta\rho_{\mathrm{cb}} + \delta\rho_\nu) = \frac{3}{2}H^2\Omega_m(a) \left[ (1-f_\nu)\delta_{\mathrm{cb}} + f_\nu\delta_\nu \right] $$
Since $\delta_\nu \approx 0$ on these scales, the equation becomes:
$$ \ddot{\delta}_{\mathrm{cb}} + 2H\dot{\delta}_{\mathrm{cb}} \approx \frac{3}{2}H^2\Omega_m(a)(1-f_\nu)\delta_{\mathrm{cb}} $$
Compared to a universe without neutrinos ($f_\nu=0$), the gravitational driving term on the right-hand side is reduced by a factor of $(1-f_\nu)$. The neutrinos contribute to the total background density $\Omega_m(a)$, which determines the Hubble friction term ($2H\dot{\delta}_{\mathrm{cb}}$), but they do not contribute to the gravitational source that drives clustering on small scales. This leads to a slower, suppressed [growth of structure](@entry_id:158527). At late times, as dark energy comes to dominate, all linear growth ceases. This causes the suppression factor to "freeze in," asymptoting to a constant value for all small-scale modes [@problem_id:3467879].

This analysis highlights a crucial point, further clarified by considering different scenarios [@problem_id:3467870]. In a mixed model like CDM+HDM, the growth rate itself becomes scale-dependent. During matter domination, modes with $k \ll k_{\mathrm{fs}}$ grow as $\delta \propto a$, while modes with $k \gg k_{\mathrm{fs}}$ have their growth suppressed, with the [density contrast](@entry_id:157948) of the clustering component growing approximately as $\delta_{\mathrm{cb}} \propto a^p$ with $p \approx 1 - \frac{3}{5}f_\nu$. This is distinct from a hypothetical pure CDM model where the initial power spectrum has a cutoff; in that case, the [growth factor](@entry_id:634572) $D(a)$ remains scale-independent, and the initial suppression is simply carried forward in time.

#### The WDM Transfer Function

For practical applications, the effect of WDM [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) is often encapsulated in a **transfer function**, $T(k)$, which relates the WDM power spectrum to the CDM [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996): $P_{\mathrm{WDM}}(k) = T^2(k) P_{\mathrm{CDM}}(k)$. A widely used fitting formula, based on numerical simulations, is [@problem_id:3467900]:
$$ T(k) = \left[1 + (\alpha k)^{2\mu}\right]^{-5/\mu} $$
Here, the parameter $\alpha$ is proportional to the [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) length and thus encodes the scale of the suppression. It depends primarily on the WDM particle mass $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$, with $\alpha \propto m_{\mathrm{WDM}}^{-1.11}$ approximately. A smaller mass implies a larger [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) scale and hence a larger $\alpha$. The parameter $\mu$ controls the sharpness of the cutoff in the [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996) and reflects the shape of the WDM particle's primordial momentum distribution. For standard thermal relics, $\mu \approx 1.12$. This formula provides a powerful tool to connect WDM [particle physics models](@entry_id:156760) to [cosmological observables](@entry_id:747921).

### The Microphysical Origins of Dark Matter "Warmness"

The "warmness" of a [dark matter candidate](@entry_id:194502), and thus its [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) scale, is determined by its production mechanism in the early universe, which sets its primordial momentum distribution.

Even for particles with the same mass, subtle differences in their initial statistics can lead to different cosmological signatures [@problem_id:3467864]. For example, a particle species with a **Fermi-Dirac (FD)** distribution has a slightly higher average momentum ($\langle p \rangle \approx 3.151 T$) compared to one with a **Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB)** distribution ($\langle p \rangle = 3T$) at the same temperature $T$. For a fixed mass, this $\approx 5\%$ difference in mean momentum translates directly into a $\approx 5\%$ difference in [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) length. However, the situation can be inverted if we instead fix the final [relic abundance](@entry_id:161012). The [number density](@entry_id:268986) for an FD distribution is about $10\%$ lower than for an MB distribution at the same temperature. To achieve the same total mass density, the FD particle must therefore be about $10\%$ more massive. This mass difference can be enough to overcome the initial momentum difference, making the MB candidate effectively "warmer" in this specific scenario. This illustrates the intricate relationship between [particle statistics](@entry_id:145640), mass, and cosmological phenomenology.

These differences become more pronounced when comparing distinct, physically motivated WDM candidates [@problem_id:3467923]:
1.  **Thermal Relic WDM**: A particle that was once in thermal equilibrium and decouples while relativistic. Its temperature today is lower than that of neutrinos if it decouples earlier (when the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $g_{*s}$, was larger). For a typical [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) at $g_{*s,X}=100$, its average momentum relative to the neutrino temperature is $\langle p/T_\nu \rangle \approx 1.5$.
2.  **Dodelson-Widrow (DW) Sterile Neutrino**: A sterile neutrino produced non-resonantly through oscillations with active neutrinos. Its momentum distribution inherits the shape of the active neutrino distribution. Thus, its average momentum is the same as that of active neutrinos, $\langle p/T_\nu \rangle \approx 3.15$.
3.  **Shi-Fuller (SF) Sterile Neutrino**: A sterile neutrino produced resonantly in the presence of a lepton asymmetry. This mechanism preferentially produces particles at low momentum, resulting in a "colder" distribution with an average momentum significantly lower than that of a thermal relic.

For a fixed particle mass, the ordering of their "warmness," and thus their [free-streaming](@entry_id:159506) length $\lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}$, is: $\lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}^{\mathrm{SF}}  \lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}^{\mathrm{thermal}}  \lambda_{\mathrm{fs}}^{\mathrm{DW}}$. This directly translates into an opposite ordering for the scale of power spectrum suppression, highlighting how different [particle physics models](@entry_id:156760) for WDM lead to distinct and potentially testable predictions for small-scale structure.

### Astrophysical and Numerical Probes

The theoretical framework of WDM and HDM is tested through a combination of astrophysical observations and numerical simulations, each with its own power and challenges.

#### The Tremaine-Gunn Bound

For fermionic [dark matter candidates](@entry_id:161634), the **Pauli exclusion principle** provides a powerful, model-independent constraint known as the **Tremaine-Gunn bound** [@problem_id:3467936]. Liouville's theorem states that the fine-grained [phase-space density](@entry_id:150180) of a collisionless fluid is conserved. This means that the maximum [phase-space density](@entry_id:150180) observed in a gravitationally collapsed object today (like a dwarf galaxy) cannot exceed the maximum primordial value set by quantum statistics.

For a fermionic dark matter particle, the maximum occupation number is limited ($f \le 1$ for each spin state). This imposes an upper limit on the coarse-grained [phase-space density](@entry_id:150180), which for a halo with a Maxwellian velocity distribution at its core can be related to the observable ratio of central density to velocity dispersion cubed, $Q \equiv \rho_0 / \sigma^3$. This leads to a lower bound on the [fermion mass](@entry_id:159379) $m$:
$$ m \ge \left[ \frac{(2\pi)^{3/2}\hbar^3}{g f_{\max}} \frac{\rho_0}{\sigma^3} \right]^{1/4} $$
where $g$ is the spin degeneracy and $f_{\max}$ is the maximum primordial occupation number (e.g., $f_{\max}=1/2$ for a typical thermal relic). By measuring $\rho_0$ and $\sigma$ for dense, dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, astronomers can place a robust lower limit on the mass of any fermionic WDM candidate. For typical dwarf galaxy values, this bound is in the range of $m \gtrsim 0.3 - 1$ keV. If $m$ were close to this bound, this "quantum pressure" would prevent the formation of steep central density cusps, naturally creating the cored profiles observed in some dwarf galaxies.

#### Numerical Challenge: Spurious Halos

Simulating WDM cosmologies presents a unique numerical challenge. In WDM, the primordial power on small scales is suppressed, leading to the formation of smooth, pronounced filaments in the cosmic web. In an $N$-body simulation, these filaments are represented by discrete particles. The inherent discreteness, or **shot noise**, of this particle representation acts as an artificial seed for [gravitational instability](@entry_id:160721) along the filament [@problem_id:3467877].

This leads to the **artificial fragmentation** of the filaments into a series of regularly spaced, unphysical clumps known as **[spurious halos](@entry_id:755257)**. These are numerical artifacts, not genuine dark matter halos formed from primordial density peaks. Understanding their properties is crucial to avoid misinterpreting simulation results. The characteristic mass of these [spurious halos](@entry_id:755257) can be shown to scale with both the numerical resolution and the underlying cosmology:
$$ M_{\mathrm{sp}} \propto \bar{\rho}\, l\, k_{\mathrm{peak}}^{-2} $$
Here, $\bar{\rho}$ is the mean [matter density](@entry_id:263043), $l$ is the mean interparticle spacing (a measure of [mass resolution](@entry_id:197946)), and $k_{\mathrm{peak}}$ is the [wavenumber](@entry_id:172452) of the peak in the WDM [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996) (a measure of the characteristic filament size). This scaling shows that higher resolution simulations (smaller $l$) produce less massive [spurious halos](@entry_id:755257), but it also reveals a fundamental coupling between numerical parameters and [cosmological parameters](@entry_id:161338) that must be carefully considered when studying the small-scale predictions of WDM.
