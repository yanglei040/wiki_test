A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Biot effective stress coefficient $\\alpha$ and the Biot modulus $M$ from fundamental principles, followed by their numerical calculation and a thermodynamic consistency check.\n\n**Derivation of the Biot Coefficient, $\\alpha$**\n\nWe consider the volumetric strain of the porous medium, $\\Delta\\epsilon_v$, as a linear function of the change in mean total stress, $\\Delta\\sigma_v$, and the change in pore fluid pressure, $\\Delta p_f$. We adopt the convention that stress, pressure, and strain are positive in compression.\nThe general relationship is:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = C_{1} \\Delta\\sigma_v - C_{2} \\Delta p_f $$\nThe coefficients $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ can be determined from two canonical experiments.\n\n1.  **Drained Hydrostatic Test**: The sample is jacketed and connected to a fluid reservoir at constant pressure, so $\\Delta p_f=0$. A hydrostatic stress $\\Delta\\sigma_v$ is applied. The drained bulk modulus $K_d$ is defined as $K_d = \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma_v}{\\Delta\\epsilon_v}$.\n    From the general relationship with $\\Delta p_f=0$, we have $\\Delta\\epsilon_v = C_{1} \\Delta\\sigma_v$.\n    Comparing with the definition of $K_d$, we find $C_{1} = \\frac{1}{K_d}$.\n\n2.  **Unjacketed Test**: The unjacketed sample is submerged in a pressurized fluid, such that the applied hydrostatic stress and the pore pressure are increased by the same amount, i.e., $\\Delta\\sigma_v = \\Delta p_f$. In this case, the porous skeleton does not feel any stress change, and the bulk volume change is solely due to the uniform compression of the solid grains. The solid grain bulk modulus $K_s$ relates the applied pressure to the volumetric strain of the solid material, and thus to the bulk material.\n    The definition is $K_s = \\frac{\\Delta p_f}{\\Delta\\epsilon_v}$.\n    From the general relationship with $\\Delta\\sigma_v = \\Delta p_f$, we have $\\Delta\\epsilon_v = (C_{1} - C_{2}) \\Delta p_f$.\n    Comparing with the definition of $K_s$, we find $C_{1} - C_{2} = \\frac{1}{K_s}$.\n\nWe can now solve for $C_{2}$:\n$$ C_{2} = C_{1} - \\frac{1}{K_s} = \\frac{1}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_s} $$\nSubstituting the coefficients back into the general relationship:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} \\Delta\\sigma_v - \\left(\\frac{1}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_s}\\right) \\Delta p_f $$\nThis is the fundamental constitutive law for the volumetric strain. Biot's theory introduces an effective stress, $\\Delta\\sigma'_v = \\Delta\\sigma_v - \\alpha\\Delta p_f$, which governs the deformation of the porous skeleton. The constitutive law is written in terms of this effective stress as:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} \\Delta\\sigma'_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (\\Delta\\sigma_v - \\alpha\\Delta p_f) $$\nComparing this form with the one we derived, we identify the coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{K_d} = \\frac{1}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_s} \\implies \\alpha = K_d \\left(\\frac{1}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_s}\\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} $$\n\n**Derivation of the Biot Modulus, $M$**\n\nThe Biot modulus $M$ appears in the second constitutive relation, which links the increment of fluid content $\\Delta\\zeta$ to the state variables. The derivation of $M$ from first principles of mass conservation is involved. A more direct and robust approach in this context is to use the well-established relations for the undrained response.\n\nThe coupled constitutive equations of linear poroelasticity, under the chosen sign convention, can be written such that the undrained bulk modulus $K_u$ is given by:\n$$ K_u = K_d + M\\alpha^2 $$\nThis equation shows that the stiffening effect from the undrained condition (trapped fluid resisting compression) is proportional to $M\\alpha^2$.\n\nAn independent expression for $K_u$ is given by Gassmann's equation, which is a fundamental result of poroelasticity derived from mass conservation and mechanical equilibrium. Gassmann's equation for an isotropic material is:\n$$ K_u = K_d + \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s}\\right)^2}{\\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{K_d}{K_s^2}} $$\nRecognizing that $\\alpha = 1 - K_d/K_s$, we can write the numerator as $\\alpha^2$:\n$$ K_u = K_d + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{K_d}{K_s^2}} $$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $K_u$, we can equate the terms for the undrained stiffening effect, $K_u - K_d$:\n$$ M\\alpha^2 = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{K_d}{K_s^2}} $$\nAssuming $\\alpha \\neq 0$, we can solve for $M$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{K_d}{K_s^2} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by substituting $\\alpha = 1 - K_d/K_s$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{K_s(1-\\alpha)}{K_s^2} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{1-\\alpha}{K_s} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi - 1+\\alpha}{K_s} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha-\\phi}{K_s} $$\nThis is the desired expression for the Biot modulus $M$.\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nGiven data: $K_{d} = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $K_{s} = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $K_{f} = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\phi = 0.25$.\n\n1.  **Calculate $\\alpha$**:\n    $$ \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} = 1 - \\frac{6.5}{36} \\approx 1 - 0.180556 = 0.819444... $$\n\n2.  **Calculate $M$**:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha - \\phi}{K_s} = \\frac{0.25}{2.2} + \\frac{0.819444... - 0.25}{36} $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{M} \\approx 0.113636... + \\frac{0.569444...}{36} \\approx 0.113636... + 0.015818... = 0.129454... \\,\\, \\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} $$\n    $$ M = \\frac{1}{0.129454...} \\approx 7.7247... \\,\\, \\mathrm{GPa} $$\n\n**Thermodynamic Admissibility Check**\n\nTo be thermodynamically admissible, the material's stored energy function must be positive definite. For the hydrostatic subspace of poroelasticity, this imposes the following conditions:\n\n1.  **$0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$**:\n    We calculated $\\alpha \\approx 0.819$. Since $0 < K_d < K_s$ ($0 < 6.5 < 36$), the ratio $K_d/K_s$ must be between $0$ and $1$, which ensures $0 < \\alpha < 1$. The condition is satisfied.\n\n2.  **$M > 0$**:\n    We calculated $M \\approx 7.725\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$. For $M$ to be positive, $1/M$ must be positive.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha-\\phi}{K_s} $$\n    Given that $\\phi, K_f, K_s$ are all positive, the term $\\phi/K_f$ is positive. Also, $\\alpha - \\phi \\approx 0.819 - 0.25 = 0.569 > 0$. Thus, the second term $(\\alpha-\\phi)/K_s$ is also positive. The sum of two positive terms is positive, so $M>0$. The condition is satisfied.\n\n3.  **$K_u \\ge K_d > 0$**:\n    We are given $K_d = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, which is greater than $0$. Now we compute $K_u$:\n    $$ K_u = K_d + M\\alpha^2 \\approx 6.5 + (7.7247...) \\times (0.819444...)^2 $$\n    $$ K_u \\approx 6.5 + (7.7247...) \\times (0.67149...) \\approx 6.5 + 5.187... = 11.687... \\,\\, \\mathrm{GPa} $$\n    We check the inequality $K_u \\ge K_d$.\n    $$ 11.687... \\,\\, \\mathrm{GPa} \\ge 6.5 \\,\\, \\mathrm{GPa} $$\n    The condition is satisfied.

The relationship between total stress increment $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, strain increment $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, and pore pressure increment $\\Delta p$:\n    $$ \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 2\\mu \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} + \\lambda \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} - \\alpha \\Delta p \\mathbf{I} $$\n    where $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the drained Lamé parameters of the solid skeleton, $\\alpha$ is the Biot effective stress coefficient, and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n\n2.  The relationship for the increment of fluid mass content per unit reference volume, $\\Delta\\zeta$:\n    $$ \\Delta\\zeta = \\alpha \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) + \\frac{1}{M} \\Delta p $$\n    where $M$ is the Biot modulus.\n\nThe term $\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$ represents the volumetric strain increment of the bulk material, denoted as $\\Delta\\epsilon_v$. We can analyze the response by considering volumetric quantities. Taking the trace of the first constitutive equation gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = (3\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) - 3\\alpha \\Delta p $$\nThe term $3\\lambda + 2\\mu$ is equal to $3K_{dr}$, where $K_{dr}$ is the drained bulk modulus of the solid skeleton. The drained bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ as $K_{dr} = \\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)}$.\nThe equation for the trace becomes:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 3K_{dr}\\Delta\\epsilon_v - 3\\alpha \\Delta p $$\nThe problem states that a uniform hydrostatic compressive stress of magnitude $\\Delta s$ is applied, so $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -\\Delta s\\,\\mathbf{I}$. The trace of this tensor is:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\mathrm{tr}(-\\Delta s\\,\\mathbf{I}) = -3\\Delta s $$\nSubstituting this into the traced constitutive equation:\n$$ -3\\Delta s = 3K_{dr}\\Delta\\epsilon_v - 3\\alpha \\Delta p $$\nDividing by $3$ gives a relation between the applied mean stress, volumetric strain, and pore pressure:\n$$ -\\Delta s = K_{dr}\\Delta\\epsilon_v - \\alpha \\Delta p $$\nFrom this, we can express the volumetric strain increment $\\Delta\\epsilon_v$:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_{dr}}(\\alpha \\Delta p - \\Delta s) \\quad (*)$$\nNext, we apply the undrained condition. Sealed boundaries mean that there is no fluid flow across the boundaries of the sample, so the total mass of fluid within the pores is constant. This corresponds to a zero increment of fluid mass content, $\\Delta\\zeta = 0$. Applying this to the second constitutive equation:\n$$ 0 = \\alpha \\Delta\\epsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} \\Delta p $$\nThis provides a second expression for the volumetric strain increment under undrained conditions:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha M} \\Delta p \\quad (**) $$\nTo find the pore pressure increment $\\Delta p$, we equate the two expressions for $\\Delta\\epsilon_v$ from equations $(*)$ and $(**)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{K_{dr}}(\\alpha \\Delta p - \\Delta s) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha M} \\Delta p $$\nNow, we solve for $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\alpha \\Delta p - \\Delta s = -\\frac{K_{dr}}{\\alpha M} \\Delta p $$\n$$ \\Delta p \\left( \\alpha + \\frac{K_{dr}}{\\alpha M} \\right) = \\Delta s $$\n$$ \\Delta p \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^2 M + K_{dr}}{\\alpha M} \\right) = \\Delta s $$\nThis yields the expression for the pore pressure increment:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\alpha M}{\\alpha^2 M + K_{dr}} \\Delta s $$\nFinally, substituting the expression for the drained bulk modulus, $K_{dr} = \\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)}$, we obtain the required analytic expression for $\\Delta p$ as a function of the given parameters:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\alpha M}{\\alpha^2 M + \\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)}} \\Delta s $$\nThe ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta s}$ under these conditions is known as Skempton's B coefficient.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n$E = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n$\\nu = 0.26$\n$\\alpha = 0.92$\n$M = 2.3\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n$\\Delta s = 12\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the drained bulk modulus $K_{dr}$:\n$$ K_{dr} = \\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)} = \\frac{8.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{3(1 - 2 \\times 0.26)} = \\frac{8.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{3(1 - 0.52)} = \\frac{8.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{3(0.48)} = \\frac{8.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{1.44} \\approx 5.555...\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nNow we can compute the terms in the expression for $\\Delta p$.

A boolean that verifies the identity $K_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}} = - \\Delta t \\left( K_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}} \\right)^{\\top}$ within a numerical tolerance of $10^{-12}$ in Frobenius norm.\n\nAll physical parameters must be used in base International System of Units (SI), specifically:\n- $E$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$,\n- $\\alpha$ dimensionless,\n- $S$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$,\n- $k$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2$,\n- $\\mu$ in $\\mathrm{Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$,\n- $L$ in $\\mathrm{m}$,\n- $A$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2$,\n- $\\Delta t$ in $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nYou must not assume any shortcut formulas beyond the fundamental laws described above. Your derivation must start from first principles.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case $1$ (general case): $E = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\alpha = 0.7$, $S = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$, $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$, $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $L = 1.0$, $A = 1.0$, $\\Delta t = 1000.0$.\n- Case $2$ (no coupling via Biot coefficient): $E = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\alpha = 0.0$, $S = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$, $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$, $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $L = 1.0$, $A = 1.0$, $\\Delta t = 1000.0$.\n- Case $3$ (small time step): $E = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\alpha = 0.7$, $S = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$, $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-16}$, $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $L = 1.0$, $A = 1.0$, $\\Delta t = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n- Case $4$ (strong coupling and larger area): $E = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}$, $\\alpha = 1.0$, $S = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$, $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$, $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, $L = 1.0$, $A = 2.0$, $\\Delta t = 10.0$.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

The overall output is the list of these per-case lists, for example $[[n_{pu}^{(1)}, n_{up}^{(1)}, b^{(1)}],[n_{pu}^{(2)}, n_{up}^{(2)}, b^{(2)}],\\dots]$.", "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of poroelasticity, is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The task is to derive and implement the calculation of specific coupling terms in the consistent tangent matrix for a one-dimensional, quasi-static, saturated poroelastic medium.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental governing equations provided.\n\nThe strong forms of the governing equations for mechanical equilibrium and fluid mass conservation in one dimension are:\nMechanical Equilibrium:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nFluid Mass Conservation (with zero source term, $q=0$):\n$$\nS \\dot{p} + \\alpha \\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe constitutive relations are given by the total stress decomposition $\\sigma = \\sigma' - \\alpha p$, the effective stress-strain relation $\\sigma' = E \\varepsilon$, and the small-strain definition $\\varepsilon = \\partial u / \\partial x$. Substituting these into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\alpha p \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe mass conservation equation can be written in terms of the primary variables $u$ and $p$ as:\n$$\nS \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\right) = 0\n$$\n\nTo obtain the weak form, we apply the method of weighted residuals. We multiply the equilibrium equation by a vector of weighting functions for displacement, $w_u$, and the mass balance by a vector of weighting functions for pressure, $w_p$. We then integrate over the element domain, $\\Omega_e$, which is a segment of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$.\nThe weak form for the mechanical equilibrium is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_e} w_u \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\alpha p \\right) \\right] d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nIntegrating by parts the first term gives:\n$$\n\\left[ w_u \\left( E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\alpha p \\right) \\right]_{\\partial \\Omega_e} - \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\frac{\\partial w_u}{\\partial x} \\left( E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\alpha p \\right) d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nIgnoring the boundary term (as is standard for element formulation), the weak form becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_e} \\frac{\\partial w_u}{\\partial x} E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} d\\Omega - \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\frac{\\partial w_u}{\\partial x} \\alpha p \\, d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nThe weak form for the mass conservation is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_e} w_p \\left[ S \\dot{p} + \\alpha \\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\right) \\right] d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nIntegrating the Darcy flux term by parts gives:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_e} w_p (S \\dot{p} + \\alpha \\dot{\\varepsilon}) d\\Omega - \\left[ w_p \\left(-\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right) \\right]_{\\partial \\Omega_e} + \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\frac{\\partial w_p}{\\partial x} \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nAgain, ignoring the boundary term, the weak form is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_e} w_p S \\dot{p} \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega_e} w_p \\alpha \\dot{\\varepsilon} \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\frac{\\partial w_p}{\\partial x} \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} d\\Omega = 0\n$$\n\nNext, we introduce the spatial discretization using the Finite Element Method. For a single $2$-node linear element of length $L$, the displacement $u$, pressure $p$, and their respective weighting functions are approximated using the same shape function matrix $\\mathbf{N} = [N_1(x), N_2(x)]$:\n$$\nu(x,t) \\approx \\mathbf{N}(x) \\mathbf{u}_e(t) \\quad , \\quad p(x,t) \\approx \\mathbf{N}(x) \\mathbf{p}_e(t)\n$$\n$$\nw_u(x) \\approx \\mathbf{N}(x) \\mathbf{w}_u \\quad , \\quad w_p(x) \\approx \\mathbf{N}(x) \\mathbf{w}_p\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}_e$ and $\\mathbf{p}_e$ are the nodal values of displacement and pressure. The strain $\\varepsilon$ and pressure gradient are approximated using the strain-displacement matrix $\\mathbf{B} = d\\mathbf{N}/dx = [-1/L, 1/L]$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{d\\mathbf{N}}{dx} \\mathbf{u}_e = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{u}_e \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{d\\mathbf{N}}{dx} \\mathbf{p}_e = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{p}_e\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the weak forms and noting that the weighting functions are arbitrary, we obtain the semi-discretized system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_u = \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^\\top E \\mathbf{B} d\\Omega \\right) \\mathbf{u}_e - \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\alpha \\mathbf{N} d\\Omega \\right) \\mathbf{p}_e = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_p = \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{N}^\\top S \\mathbf{N} d\\Omega \\right) \\dot{\\mathbf{p}}_e + \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{N}^\\top \\alpha \\mathbf{B} d\\Omega \\right) \\dot{\\mathbf{u}}_e + \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\mathbf{B} d\\Omega \\right) \\mathbf{p}_e = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nFor the time discretization, we use the backward Euler method with a time step $\\Delta t$, where $\\dot{f} \\approx (f^n - f^{n-1})/\\Delta t$. The fully discretized residual equations at time step $n$ are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_u(\\mathbf{u}_e^n, \\mathbf{p}_e^n) = \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^\\top E \\mathbf{B} d\\Omega \\right) \\mathbf{u}_e^n - \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\alpha \\mathbf{N} d\\Omega \\right) \\mathbf{p}_e^n = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_p(\\mathbf{u}_e^n, \\mathbf{p}_e^n) = \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{N}^\\top S \\mathbf{N} d\\Omega \\right) \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_e^n - \\mathbf{p}_e^{n-1}}{\\Delta t} + \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{N}^\\top \\alpha \\mathbf{B} d\\Omega \\right) \\frac{\\mathbf{u}_e^n - \\mathbf{u}_e^{n-1}}{\\Delta t} + \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\mathbf{B} d\\Omega \\right) \\mathbf{p}_e^n = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nThe monolithic Newton-Raphson scheme requires the consistent tangent matrix (Jacobian), $\\mathbf{K}_T$, obtained by linearizing the residual vector $\\mathbf{R} = [\\mathbf{R}_u^\\top, \\mathbf{R}_p^\\top]^\\top$ with respect to the solution vector of unknowns $\\mathbf{X} = [\\mathbf{u}_e^{n \\top}, \\mathbf{p}_e^{n \\top}]^\\top$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_T = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}}{\\partial \\mathbf{X}} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\partial \\mathbf{R}_u / \\partial \\mathbf{u}_e^n & \\partial \\mathbf{R}_u / \\partial \\mathbf{p}_e^n \\\\ \\partial \\mathbf{R}_p / \\partial \\mathbf{u}_e^n & \\partial \\mathbf{R}_p / \\partial \\mathbf{p}_e^n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{K}_{uu} & \\mathbf{K}_{up} \\\\ \\mathbf{K}_{pu} & \\mathbf{K}_{pp} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the coupling blocks $\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}}$ and $\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}}$.\nThe block $\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}}$ is the component of $\\mathbf{K}_{up}$ arising from the divergence a pressure term. This term is $-\\alpha p$ in the stress $\\sigma$. This corresponds to the derivative of $\\mathbf{R}_u$ with respect to $\\mathbf{p}_e^n$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_u}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}_e^n} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}_e^n} \\left[ - \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\alpha \\mathbf{N} d\\Omega \\right) \\mathbf{p}_e^n \\right] = - \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\alpha \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\mathbf{N} d\\Omega\n$$\nThe block $\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}}$ is the component of $\\mathbf{K}_{pu}$ arising from the storage term. This corresponds to the coupling term $\\alpha \\dot{\\varepsilon}$ in the mass balance.

The domain integral is $\\int_{\\Omega_e} (\\cdot) d\\Omega = \\int_0^L (\\cdot) A dx$. The shape functions are $N_1(x) = 1 - x/L$ and $N_2(x) = x/L$. The strain-displacement matrix is constant: $\\mathbf{B} = [-1/L, 1/L]$.\nFirst, we evaluate $\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}} = - \\alpha A \\int_0^L \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\mathbf{N}(x) dx = - \\alpha A \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\int_0^L [1-x/L, x/L] dx\n$$\nThe integral of the shape functions is $\\int_0^L [1-x/L, x/L] dx = [x - x^2/(2L), x^2/(2L)]_0^L = [L/2, L/2]$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}} = - \\alpha A \\begin{bmatrix} -1/L \\\\ 1/L \\end{bmatrix} [L/2, L/2] = - \\alpha A \\begin{bmatrix} -1/2 & -1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & 1/2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\alpha A}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we evaluate $\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\Delta t} A \\int_0^L \\mathbf{N}(x)^\\top \\mathbf{B} dx = \\frac{\\alpha A}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\int_0^L \\mathbf{B}^\\top \\mathbf{N}(x) dx\\right)^\\top\n$$\nUsing the result from the previous integral:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}} = \\frac{\\alpha A}{\\Delta t} \\begin{bmatrix} -1/2 & 1/2 \\\\ -1/2 & 1/2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\alpha A}{2 \\Delta t} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nFinally, we must verify the identity $\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}} = - \\Delta t (\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}})^\\top$.\nLet's compute the right-hand side using the derived expression for $\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}})^\\top = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha A}{2 \\Delta t} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)^\\top = \\frac{\\alpha A}{2 \\Delta t} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nMultiplying by $-\\Delta t$:\n$$\n- \\Delta t (\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}})^\\top = - \\Delta t \\left( \\frac{\\alpha A}{2 \\Delta t} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = - \\frac{\\alpha A}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\alpha A}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis result is identical to the derived expression for $\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}}$, thus verifying the identity analytically.\n\nThe program will compute the Frobenius norms of these matrices:\n$$\n||\\mathbf{K}_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}}||_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^2\\sum_{j=1}^2 |(K_{up}^{\\mathrm{div}})_{ij}|^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha A}{2}\\right)^2 (1^2+1^2+(-1)^2+(-1)^2)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha A}{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot 4} = |\\alpha A|\n$$\n$$\n||\\mathbf{K}_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}}||_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^2\\sum_{j=1}^2 |(K_{pu}^{\\mathrm{stor}})_{ij}|^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha A}{2\\Delta t}\\right)^2 ((-1)^2+1^2+(-1)^2+1^2)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha A}{2\\Delta t}\\right)^2 \\cdot 4} = \\left|\\frac{\\alpha A}{\\Delta t}\\right|\n$$\nThe implementation will use these closed-form expressions for the norms and the full matrix expressions to verify the identity numerically.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes coupling matrix contributions for a 1D poroelastic problem\n    and verifies a reciprocity identity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Parameters are: (E, alpha, S, k, mu, L, A, dt)\n    # Note: E, S, k, mu, L are not needed for the specific blocks requested,\n    # as they are not part of the integral definitions.\n    # We only need alpha, A, and dt.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: (alpha, A, dt)\n        (0.7, 1.0, 1000.0),\n        # Case 2: (alpha, A, dt)\n        (0.0, 1.0, 1000.0),\n        # Case 3: (alpha, A, dt)\n        (0.7, 1.0, 1.0e-6),\n        # Case 4: (alpha, A, dt)\n        (1.0, 2.0, 10.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Numerical tolerance for identity verification\n    tolerance = 1e-12\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        alpha, A, delta_t = case\n\n        # Construct the mechanical-to-pressure coupling block K_up^div\n        # K_up^div = (alpha * A / 2) * [[1, 1], [-1, -1]]\n        K_up_div = (alpha * A / 2.0) * np.array([[1.0, 1.0], [-1.0, -1.0]])\n\n        # Construct the pressure-to-mechanical coupling block K_pu^stor\n        # K_pu^stor = (alpha * A / (2 * dt)) * [[-1, 1], [-1, 1]]\n        if delta_t == 0:\n            # Avoid division by zero, though not present in test cases\n            K_pu_stor = np.zeros((2, 2))\n        else:\n            K_pu_stor = (alpha * A / (2.0 * delta_t)) * np.array([[-1.0, 1.0], [-1.0, 1.0]])\n\n        # 1.
