All necessary data and conditions for a unique and meaningful solution are provided. The problem is a standard exercise in fundamental acoustics and is free of any inconsistencies or flaws.\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental equations of fluid dynamics, linearized for small acoustic perturbations. We consider a one-dimensional flow along the $x$-axis. The fluid properties are decomposed into a quiescent mean value (subscript $0$) and a small time- and space-dependent perturbation (primed quantity). The velocity $v(x,t)$ is itself a perturbation, as the mean velocity is zero. The relevant variables are:\n- Density: $\\rho(x, t) = \\rho_0 + \\rho'(x, t)$\n- Pressure: $p(x, t) = p_0 + p'(x, t)$\n- Fluid velocity: $v(x, t)$\n\nThe first governing equation is the conservation of mass, or continuity equation. In one dimension, it is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\rho v)}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the perturbed quantities gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho_0 + \\rho')}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial ((\\rho_0 + \\rho') v)}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nExpanding and retaining only first-order terms (linearization), we neglect the product of small quantities $\\rho' v$. Since $\\rho_0$ is a constant, its derivatives are zero. This yields the linearized continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho'}{\\partial t} + \\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\nThe second governing equation is the conservation of momentum for an inviscid fluid (Euler's equation). In one dimension, it is:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right) = - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting the perturbed quantities:\n$$\n(\\rho_0 + \\rho') \\left( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right) = - \\frac{\\partial (p_0 + p')}{\\partial x}\n$$\nLinearizing this equation involves dropping second-order terms. The convective acceleration term $v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$ is a product of small quantities. The term $\\rho' \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}$ is also second-order. The mean pressure gradient $\\frac{\\partial p_0}{\\partial x}$ is zero for a fluid in equilibrium. This leaves the linearized momentum equation:\n$$\n\\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} \\quad (2)\n$$\nThe third required relationship is the equation of state, linking pressure and density fluctuations. The problem specifies an isentropic process, for which the bulk modulus $K$ is defined as:\n$$\nK = \\rho \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho} \\bigg|_s\n$$\nFor small perturbations, this can be written as a linear relationship between the acoustic pressure $p'$ and the acoustic density fluctuation $\\rho'$:\n$$\np' = \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho}\\right)_0 \\rho' = \\frac{K}{\\rho_0} \\rho' \\quad (3)\n$$\nHere, the mean density $\\rho_0$ is denoted by $\\rho$ in the problem statement. We will use $\\rho$ henceforth for simplicity. So, $p' = (K/\\rho)\\rho'$.\n\nTo derive the wave equation, we combine these three equations to eliminate two of the three variables ($p'$, $\\rho'$, $v$). We will derive an equation solely in terms of the acoustic pressure $p'$.\nFirst, differentiate equation (2) with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial t \\partial x} = - \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nNext, differentiate equation (1) with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho'}{\\partial t^2} + \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial t} = 0\n$$\nFrom the second of these, we can write $\\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho'}{\\partial t^2}$. Equating the two expressions for the mixed partial derivative term gives:\n$$\n- \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} = - \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho'}{\\partial t^2} \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho'}{\\partial t^2}\n$$\nNow, we use the equation of state (3) to eliminate $\\rho'$. From $p' = (K/\\rho)\\rho'$, we have $\\rho' = (\\rho/K)p'$. Differentiating this twice with respect to time yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho'}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\rho}{K} \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the previous result gives the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\rho}{K} \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2}\n$$\nThis can be written in the standard form $\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} = 0$, where we identify $c^2 = K/\\rho$.

The problem asks for the element size that \"you would use,\" which corresponds to this choice.\n\nWe set the element size $h$ to this minimum allowed value:\n$$ h = \\frac{\\lambda}{12} = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}}{12} = \\frac{1}{24}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $k$ and $h$ into the inequality to find the minimum integer polynomial degree $p \\ge 1$ that satisfies it.\nThe product $kh$ is a dimensionless quantity representing the number of radians per element:\n$$ kh = (4\\pi\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}) \\left(\\frac{1}{24}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{24} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} $$\n\nThe inequality to solve for $p$ becomes:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\pi/6}{p+1}\\right)^{2p} \\leq 0.01 $$\n\nWe test integer values of $p$ starting from $p=1$.\n\nFor $p=1$ (linear elements):\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the inequality is:\n$$ \\mathrm{LHS}_{p=1} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi/6}{1+1}\\right)^{2(1)} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)^2 \\approx (0.261799)^2 \\approx 0.068539 $$\nSince $0.068539 > 0.01$, a polynomial degree of $p=1$ is insufficient to meet the error target.\n\nFor $p=2$ (quadratic elements):\nThe LHS of the inequality is:\n$$ \\mathrm{LHS}_{p=2} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi/6}{2+1}\\right)^{2(2)} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{18}\\right)^4 \\approx (0.174533)^4 \\approx 0.0009234 $$\nSince $0.0009234  0.01$, a polynomial degree of $p=2$ is sufficient.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest integer $p \\ge 1$, the required polynomial degree is $p=2$.\n\nThe corresponding element size is $h = 1/24\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The problem asks for this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ h = \\frac{1}{24}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.041666...\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $h = 0.04167\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThus, the smallest integer polynomial degree that guarantees the error target under the given resource constraint is $p=2$, and the element size to be used is $h=0.04167\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The cavity dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$ are consistent with using such an element size (e.g., $1\\,\\mathrm{m} / (1/24\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 24$ elements) but are not directly needed for this calculation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.04167  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3495287"}]}
