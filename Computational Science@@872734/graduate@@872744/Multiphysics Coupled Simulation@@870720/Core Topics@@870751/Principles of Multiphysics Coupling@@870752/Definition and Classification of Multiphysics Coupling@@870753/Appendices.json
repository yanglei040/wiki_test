The structure obeys Newton’s second law, and its characteristic time is $T_s$, defined by its dominant mode. The fluid exerts an added-mass type traction on the interface that is proportional to the interface acceleration and characterized by a fluid response time $T_f$ capturing the dominant fluid information-transfer (for example, wave or convective) time across the fluid subsystem. You may assume the added-mass traction scales as an inertial reaction with a geometric prefactor that is the same for both subsystems, so that ratios of effective masses reduce to ratios of densities.\n\nConsider a partitioned, one-step, loosely coupled (non-iterated within a time step) Dirichlet–Neumann algorithm that exchanges interface data once per time step.

No numerical evaluation is required and no units should be included in the final answer expression.", "solution": "The problem requires a control-oriented derivation of a dimensionless coupling stability index, $\\mathsf{CSI}$, for a one-dimensional, linearized FSI system. The stability of the partitioned, loosely coupled Dirichlet–Neumann scheme is to be analyzed by modeling the interface exchange as a unity-feedback loop.\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the open-loop process. In an explicit, non-iterated scheme, information is passed sequentially from one physics domain to the other. We can analyze the amplification of a perturbation over one full cycle of this exchange.\n1.  A perturbation is initiated in the structural motion.\n2.  The fluid domain senses this motion and, after a characteristic response time, generates a reactive force.\n3.  This force is then applied to the structure, which in turn responds over its characteristic time, resulting in a new state of motion.\n\nThe open-loop gain is the ratio of the final motion perturbation to the initial one. The system is stable if this gain has a magnitude less than unity, ensuring that perturbations decay over successive exchanges.\n\nLet us model the response of each subsystem using the given parameters. The interface displacement is denoted by $u(t)$, and its time derivatives are velocity $\\dot{u}(t)$ and acceleration $\\ddot{u}(t)$.\n\nFirst, consider the response of the fluid subsystem. The problem states that the fluid exerts an added-mass type traction proportional to the interface acceleration. The characteristic time for the fluid to establish this response is $T_f$. Consider a perturbation in the interface velocity, $\\delta \\dot{u}$. Over the fluid response time $T_f$, this velocity change corresponds to an effective acceleration of $\\ddot{u} \\approx \\frac{\\delta \\dot{u}}{T_f}$. The reactive force from the fluid, $F_f$, is thus:\n$$ F_f \\approx -M_f \\ddot{u} \\approx -M_f \\frac{\\delta \\dot{u}}{T_f} $$\nwhere $M_f$ is the effective added mass of the fluid. The negative sign indicates that the force opposes the acceleration, consistent with an inertial reaction.\n\nNext, consider the response of the structural subsystem. This fluid force, $F_f$, is applied to the structure as an external load in the explicit exchange, so $F_s = F_f$. According to Newton's second law, this force causes the structure to accelerate: $M_s \\ddot{u}_s = F_s$. The structure's response evolves over its own characteristic time, $T_s$. The change in the structure's velocity, $\\delta \\dot{u}'$, resulting from the application of force $F_s$ can be estimated from the impulse-momentum relationship over the time $T_s$:\n$$ M_s \\delta \\dot{u}' \\approx F_s T_s $$\nThis implies:\n$$ \\delta \\dot{u}' \\approx \\frac{F_s T_s}{M_s} $$\n\nNow, we can combine these steps to find the open-loop gain. We substitute the expression for the fluid force $F_s = F_f$ into the structural response equation:\n$$ \\delta \\dot{u}' \\approx \\frac{\\left(-M_f \\frac{\\delta \\dot{u}}{T_f}\\right) T_s}{M_s} $$\nRearranging this equation gives the ratio of the output velocity perturbation, $\\delta \\dot{u}'$, to the input velocity perturbation, $\\delta \\dot{u}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta \\dot{u}'}{\\delta \\dot{u}} \\approx -\\frac{M_f}{M_s} \\frac{T_s}{T_f} $$\nThis dimensionless ratio is the open-loop gain, $G$, of the interface exchange.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of the added-mass parameter, $\\mathcal{M} = \\rho_f/\\rho_s$. It also states that geometric scaling factors cancel, such that the ratio of effective masses reduces to the ratio of densities: $M_f/M_s = \\rho_f/\\rho_s = \\mathcal{M}$. Substituting this into the gain expression yields:\n$$ G = -\\mathcal{M} \\frac{T_s}{T_f} $$\nThe explicit, non-iterated coupling scheme is mathematically equivalent to a fixed-point iteration. Such an iteration is stable if and only if its amplification factor (the magnitude of the open-loop gain) is less than unity. This provides the stability condition:\n$$ |G|  1 \\implies \\left|-\\mathcal{M} \\frac{T_s}{T_f}\\right|  1 \\implies \\mathcal{M} \\frac{T_s}{T_f}  1 $$\nThe dimensionless group $\\mathcal{M} \\frac{T_s}{T_f}$ is the quantity that determines the stability of the coupling. The problem asks for a Coupling Stability Index, $\\mathsf{CSI}$, that increases as the coupling becomes more challenging (i.e., as instability is approached). This group fits the description: it increases when the added-mass effect $\\mathcal{M}$ strengthens, and it increases as the fluid reacts more quickly than the structure (i.e., as $T_f$ decreases relative to $T_s$, making the ratio $T_s/T_f$ larger).\n\nTherefore, we can define the Coupling Stability Index as:\n$$ \\mathsf{CSI} = \\mathcal{M} \\frac{T_s}{T_f} $$\nThis expression is a function of $\\mathcal{M}$ and the time-scale ratio $T_f/T_s$, as requested, since it can be written as $\\mathsf{CSI} = \\mathcal{M} (T_f/T_s)^{-1}$.\n\nThe classification rule for algorithm selection follows directly from the stability condition. The explicit, non-iterated scheme is stable only if $\\mathsf{CSI}  1$. If $\\mathsf{CSI} \\ge 1$, the scheme is unstable, and spurious energy will be generated at the interface, leading to a numerical blow-up. In such cases, a more robust, strongly coupled algorithm is mandatory. This typically involves implicit interface coupling, where the interface conditions for both physics are solved simultaneously or iterated to convergence within each time step. Thus, implicit iteration is mandatory when $\\mathsf{CSI} \\ge 1$.\n\nThe final answer is the derived analytical expression for $\\mathsf{CSI}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\mathcal{M} \\frac{T_s}{T_f}}\n$$", "id": "3502099"}, {"introduction": "To move from application-specific insights to a universal methodology, we can formalize the analysis of coupling strength within the framework of numerical linear algebra.
