This practice guides you through a foundational derivation, showing how jump conditions emerge directly from applying fundamental conservation laws to a control volume straddling an interface.

The interface between the two fluids is smooth and carries a constant isotropic surface tension $\\gamma$. There are no body forces, temperature gradients, or surfactant effects, and the interface is free of mass transfer.

The derivation must be based on the conservation of linear momentum.\n\nLet us begin by applying the principle of conservation of linear momentum to a control volume that straddles the interface between the droplet fluid (phase '$+$') and the ambient fluid (phase '$-$'). For a system in a static equilibrium state with no body forces, the integral form of the momentum equation dictates that the sum of all surface forces acting on any control volume must be zero.\n\nWe construct a small \"pillbox\" control volume that is aligned with the local normal to the interface, $\\boldsymbol{n}$, and bisected by the interface. Let this pillbox be a cylinder of small height $h$ and small base area $\\delta A$. The top cap of the cylinder lies in the droplet fluid ($+$) and the bottom cap lies in the ambient fluid ($-$). As we consider the limit where the height $h \\to 0$, the forces acting on the side walls of the pillbox become negligible compared to the forces on the top and bottom caps. The remaining forces to be balanced are the pressure forces on the top and bottom caps and the surface tension force acting on the perimeter where the interface intersects the pillbox's side wall.\n\nLet's orient our coordinate system such that the normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ at the center of our pillbox points in the $z$-direction. The forces acting on the fluid within the control volume in the $\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction are:\n1. The force on the top cap at $z>0$ due to the pressure $p^{+}$ of the interior fluid. This force is $F_{\\text{top}} = -p^{+} \\delta A$. The negative sign indicates the force acts in the $-\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction (pressure is compressive).\n2. The force on the bottom cap at $z0$ due to the pressure $p^{-}$ of the exterior fluid. This force is $F_{\\text{bot}} = p^{-} \\delta A$. This force acts in the $+\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction.\n3. The force due to surface tension, $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\gamma}$. This force acts on the perimeter of the interface, which is a circle for our pillbox cutting through the spherical droplet. The surface tension $\\gamma$ exerts a force tangential to the surface. Due to the curvature of the interface, the sum of these tangential forces around the perimeter results in a net force component along the normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This net force pulls the surface inward, toward its center of curvature.\nFor a spherical droplet of radius $R$, the center of curvature is the center of the sphere. The normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is defined as pointing from the ambient fluid to the droplet interior, hence it points towards the center of curvature. The surface tension force on the fluid within the control volume is therefore directed along $\\boldsymbol{n}$.\n\nTo calculate this force, consider a small spherical cap defined by a small angle $\\alpha$ from the pole. The radius of the perimeter circle is $r_{\\text{cap}} = R \\sin\\alpha$. The total tension along this perimeter is $\\gamma (2\\pi r_{\\text{cap}})$. This force is directed tangentially to the surface, making an angle $\\alpha$ with the plane perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{n}$. The component of this force in the direction of $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is $(\\gamma 2\\pi R \\sin\\alpha)\\sin\\alpha$. The area of the control volume cap, projected onto the plane normal to $\\boldsymbol{n}$, is $\\delta A = \\pi r_{\\text{cap}}^2 = \\pi (R\\sin\\alpha)^2 = \\pi R^2 \\sin^2\\alpha$.\nThus, the surface tension force is $F_{\\gamma} = 2\\pi\\gamma R \\sin^2\\alpha = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} (\\pi R^2 \\sin^2\\alpha) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} \\delta A$. This force acts in the $+\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction.\n\nThe force balance equation for the fluid in the pillbox, in the $\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction, is:\n$$\nF_{\\text{top}} + F_{\\text{bot}} + F_{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$\n-p^{+} \\delta A + p^{-} \\delta A + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} \\delta A = 0\n$$\nDividing by the area $\\delta A$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n-p^{+} + p^{-} + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\np^{+} - p^{-} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nUsing the problem's definition of the pressure jump, $[p] = p^{+} - p^{-}$, we obtain the first required expression:\n$$\n[p] = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nThis is the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical interface.\n\nThe problem also asks for the interfacial jump relation for the normal stress. The normal stress, $\\sigma_{nn}$, on a surface with normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is given by $\\sigma_{nn} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the total stress tensor. For a static incompressible Newtonian fluid, the velocity field is zero, so the viscous stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is zero. The total stress tensor is purely isotropic: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\boldsymbol{I}$, where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity tensor.\nThe jump in normal stress is $[\\sigma_{nn}] = \\sigma_{nn}^{+} - \\sigma_{nn}^{-}$. Let us compute each term:\n$\\sigma_{nn}^{+} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{+} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot (-p^{+}\\boldsymbol{I}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = -p^{+}(\\boldsymbol{n}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}) = -p^{+}$.\n$\\sigma_{nn}^{-} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{-} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot (-p^{-}\\boldsymbol{I}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = -p^{-}(\\boldsymbol{n}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}) = -p^{-}$.\nTherefore, the jump in normal stress is:\n$$\n[\\sigma_{nn}] = (-p^{+}) - (-p^{-}) = p^{-} - p^{+} = -(p^{+} - p^{-}) = -[p]\n$$\nThe mean curvature $H$ of a sphere of radius $R$ is given by $H = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R}) = \\frac{1}{R}$.\nWe can express our result for the pressure jump in terms of the mean curvature: $[p] = 2\\gamma H$.\nCombining this with the relation $[\\sigma_{nn}] = -[p]$, we find the interfacial jump relation for the normal stress:\n$$\n[\\sigma_{nn}] = -2\\gamma H = -\\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nThis relation states that the jump in normal stress across the interface is balanced by the force induced by surface tension and curvature.\n\nFinally, we must determine the limit of the pressure jump $[p]$ as the radius $R$ approaches infinity. This corresponds physically to a flat interface.\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} [p] = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nSince the surface tension $\\gamma$ is a constant, as $R \\to \\infty$, the denominator becomes infinitely large, and the expression approaches zero.\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} [p] = 0\n$$\nThis confirms the physical intuition that there is no pressure jump across a flat interface in the absence of other effects.\n\nThe problem asks for a two-entry row matrix containing the analytic expression for $[p]$ and the value of its limit as $R \\to \\infty$. The two entries are $\\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$ and $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2\\gamma}{R}  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3510796"}, {"introduction": "Interface conditions are not limited to static systems; they are critical for determining the outcome of dynamic interactions, such as wave propagation.

The derivation must start from fundamental principles of conservation and constitutive laws.\n\n**1. Wave Fields and Impedance Relations**\n\nWe begin by defining the wave fields in the fluid ($x0$) and the solid ($x0$). All fields are assumed to have a harmonic time dependence of the form $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\n**1.1. Fluid Medium ($x0$)**\nIn the inviscid, compressible fluid, the acoustic field is a superposition of an incident wave propagating in the $+x$ direction and a reflected wave propagating in the $-x$ direction.\n\nThe incident pressure $p_i$ and normal particle velocity $v_{f,i}$ are given by:\n$$ p_i(x,t) = \\hat{p}_i \\exp\\big(i(k_f x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\n$$ v_{f,i}(x,t) = \\hat{v}_{f,i} \\exp\\big(i(k_f x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\nHere, $\\hat{p}_i$ and $\\hat{v}_{f,i}$ are the complex amplitudes, and $k_f = \\omega/c_f$ is the fluid acoustic wavenumber, where $c_f$ is the sound speed. The relationship between pressure and velocity amplitudes is derived from the linearized one-dimensional Euler's (momentum) equation, $\\rho_f \\frac{\\partial v_f}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial p_f}{\\partial x}$. Substituting the wave forms yields:\n$$ \\rho_f (-i\\omega) \\hat{v}_{f,i} = -(ik_f) \\hat{p}_i \\implies \\hat{p}_i = \\frac{\\rho_f \\omega}{k_f} \\hat{v}_{f,i} = \\rho_f c_f \\hat{v}_{f,i} $$\nWe define the characteristic acoustic impedance of the fluid as $Z_f = \\rho_f c_f$, so $\\hat{p}_i = Z_f \\hat{v}_{f,i}$.\n\nThe reflected pressure $p_r$ and velocity $v_{f,r}$ propagate in the $-x$ direction:\n$$ p_r(x,t) = \\hat{p}_r \\exp\\big(i(-k_f x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\n$$ v_{f,r}(x,t) = \\hat{v}_{f,r} \\exp\\big(i(-k_f x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\nApplying the momentum equation similarly gives:\n$$ \\rho_f (-i\\omega) \\hat{v}_{f,r} = -(-ik_f) \\hat{p}_r \\implies \\hat{p}_r = -\\frac{\\rho_f \\omega}{k_f} \\hat{v}_{f,r} = -Z_f \\hat{v}_{f,r} $$\n\nThe total acoustic pressure and velocity in the fluid are $p_f = p_i + p_r$ and $v_f = v_{f,i} + v_{f,r}$, respectively.\n\n**1.2. Solid Medium ($x0$)**\nIn the homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic solid, a normally incident acoustic wave excites only a longitudinal (compressional) wave propagating in the $+x$ direction. There is no shear wave generation. Let the displacement field in the solid be $\\mathbf{u}_s = (u_x(x,t), 0, 0)$. The transmitted velocity is $v_s = \\partial u_x / \\partial t$. We write the transmitted velocity field as:\n$$ v_{s}(x,t) = \\hat{v}_{s,t} \\exp\\big(i(k_L x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\nwhere $\\hat{v}_{s,t}$ is the complex velocity amplitude at $x=0$ and $k_L = \\omega/c_L$ is the longitudinal wavenumber in the solid. The longitudinal wave speed is given as $c_L=\\sqrt{(\\lambda+2\\mu)/\\rho_{s}}$.\n\nThe relevant stress component is the normal stress $\\sigma_{xx}$. According to Hooke's law for an isotropic solid, $\\sigma_{xx} = (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\epsilon_{xx}$, where $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\partial u_x / \\partial x$ is the normal strain.\nFrom $v_s = \\partial u_x / \\partial t$, we find $u_x(x,t) = \\frac{\\hat{v}_{s,t}}{-i\\omega} \\exp\\big(i(k_L x - \\omega t)\\big)$.\nThe strain is then $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{ik_L}{-i\\omega} \\hat{v}_{s,t} \\exp\\big(i(k_L x - \\omega t)\\big) = \\frac{k_L}{\\omega} v_s(x,t) = \\frac{1}{c_L} v_s(x,t)$.\nThe stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ is thus:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(x,t) = (\\lambda + 2\\mu) \\frac{1}{c_L} v_s(x,t) $$\nUsing $c_L^2 = (\\lambda+2\\mu)/\\rho_s$, we can write $(\\lambda+2\\mu) = \\rho_s c_L^2$.\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(x,t) = \\frac{\\rho_s c_L^2}{c_L} v_s(x,t) = \\rho_s c_L v_s(x,t) $$\nThis defines the longitudinal impedance of the solid, $Z_L = \\rho_s c_L$, such that $\\sigma_{xx} = Z_L v_s$.\n\n**2. Interface Conditions at $x=0$**\nAt the fluid-solid interface at $x=0$, we apply two continuity conditions.\n\n**2.1. Continuity of Normal Velocity**\nThe normal component of particle velocity must be continuous across the interface to prevent cavitation or material overlap.\n$$ v_f(0,t) = v_s(0,t) $$\nEvaluating the total fields at $x=0$:\n$$ v_{f,i}(0,t) + v_{f,r}(0,t) = v_s(0,t) $$\nIn terms of complex amplitudes (after dropping the common factor $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$):\n$$ \\hat{v}_{f,i} + \\hat{v}_{f,r} = \\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\nUsing the impedance relations, $\\hat{v}_{f,i} = \\hat{p}_i/Z_f$ and $\\hat{v}_{f,r} = -\\hat{p}_r/Z_f$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p}_i}{Z_f} - \\frac{\\hat{p}_r}{Z_f} = \\hat{v}_{s,t} \\quad \\quad (1) $$\n\n**2.2. Continuity of Normal Traction**\nThe normal traction (force per unit area) must be continuous across the interface, as a consequence of Newton's third law for a massless interface. Let us consider the forces acting on an infinitesimal element of the interface. The force exerted by the fluid on the interface is $p_f A$ in the $+x$ direction, where $A$ is the area. The force exerted by the solid on the interface is $-\\sigma_{xx} A$ in the $+x$ direction. For equilibrium, these forces must balance:\n$$ p_f(0,t) A - \\sigma_{xx}(0,t) A = 0 \\implies p_f(0,t) = \\sigma_{xx}(0,t) $$\nEvaluating the fields at $x=0$:\n$$ p_i(0,t) + p_r(0,t) = \\sigma_{xx}(0,t) $$\nIn terms of complex amplitudes:\n$$ \\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r = Z_L \\hat{v}_{s,t} \\quad \\quad (2) $$\n\n**3. Solving for Coefficients $R$ and $T$**\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the amplitudes:\n$$ (1) \\quad \\hat{p}_i - \\hat{p}_r = Z_f \\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\n$$ (2) \\quad \\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r = Z_L \\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\n\nTo find the reflection coefficient $R = \\hat{p}_r / \\hat{p}_i$, we eliminate $\\hat{v}_{s,t}$. Dividing equation $(2)$ by equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r}{\\hat{p}_i - \\hat{p}_r} = \\frac{Z_L}{Z_f} $$\n$$ Z_f(\\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r) = Z_L(\\hat{p}_i - \\hat{p}_r) $$\n$$ Z_f \\hat{p}_i + Z_f \\hat{p}_r = Z_L \\hat{p}_i - Z_L \\hat{p}_r $$\nRearranging to solve for $\\hat{p}_r$:\n$$ \\hat{p}_r(Z_L + Z_f) = \\hat{p}_i(Z_L - Z_f) $$\n$$ R = \\frac{\\hat{p}_r}{\\hat{p}_i} = \\frac{Z_L - Z_f}{Z_L + Z_f} $$\n\nTo find the transmission coefficient $T = \\hat{v}_{s,t} / \\hat{v}_{f,i}$, we solve the system for $\\hat{v}_{s,t}$. Add equations $(1)$ and $(2)$:\n$$ (\\hat{p}_i - \\hat{p}_r) + (\\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r) = (Z_f + Z_L)\\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\n$$ 2\\hat{p}_i = (Z_L + Z_f)\\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\n$$ \\hat{v}_{s,t} = \\frac{2\\hat{p}_i}{Z_L + Z_f} $$\nThe transmission coefficient is defined as the ratio of velocity amplitudes, $T = \\hat{v}_{s,t} / \\hat{v}_{f,i}$. Using $\\hat{p}_i = Z_f \\hat{v}_{f,i}$:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{\\hat{v}_{f,i}} \\left(\\frac{2(Z_f \\hat{v}_{f,i})}{Z_L + Z_f}\\right) = \\frac{2 Z_f}{Z_L + Z_f} $$\n\n**4. Final Expressions**\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the impedances in terms of the given material properties: $\\rho_f$, $c_f$, $\\rho_s$, $\\lambda$, and $\\mu$.\n$$ Z_f = \\rho_f c_f $$\n$$ Z_L = \\rho_s c_L = \\rho_s \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda + 2\\mu}{\\rho_s}} = \\sqrt{\\rho_s (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} $$\n\nThe reflection and transmission coefficients are:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_s (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} - \\rho_f c_f}{\\sqrt{\\rho_s (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} + \\rho_f c_f} $$\n$$ T = \\frac{2 \\rho_f c_f}{\\sqrt{\\rho_s (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} + \\rho_f c_f} $$\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row matrix.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_{s} (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} - \\rho_{f} c_{f}}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{s} (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} + \\rho_{f} c_{f}}  \\frac{2 \\rho_{f} c_{f}}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{s} (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} + \\rho_{f} c_{f}} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3510832"}, {"introduction": "Translating continuous physical laws into robust numerical algorithms is a core task in computational multiphysics.

We now solve for the flux $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$:\n$$\nu_i - u_{i+1} = F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} \\frac{h}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_i} + \\frac{1}{k_{i+1}} \\right) = F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} \\frac{h}{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{i+1} + k_i}{k_i k_{i+1}} \\right)\n$$\nIsolating $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$ yields the final expression:\n$$\nF_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = (u_i - u_{i+1}) \\frac{2}{h} \\frac{k_i k_{i+1}}{k_i + k_{i+1}}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nF_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{2 k_i k_{i+1}}{k_i + k_{i+1}} \\frac{u_i - u_{i+1}}{h}\n$$\nThis expression represents the flux from cell $i$ to cell $i+1$. If $u_i > u_{i+1}$, the flux is positive, as expected. The effective diffusion coefficient at the interface, $\\frac{2 k_i k_{i+1}}{k_i + k_{i+1}}$, is twice the harmonic mean of the adjacent coefficients. This construction correctly enforces continuity of flux at the discrete level, is inherently conservative, and is known to provide a second-order accurate discretization for the cell-centered values on a uniform grid.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2 k_i k_{i+1}}{k_i + k_{i+1}} \\frac{u_i - u_{i+1}}{h}}\n$$", "id": "3510797"}]}
