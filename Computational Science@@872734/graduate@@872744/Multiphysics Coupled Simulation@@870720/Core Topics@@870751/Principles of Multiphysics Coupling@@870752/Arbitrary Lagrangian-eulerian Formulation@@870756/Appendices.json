Derivation of the mesh velocity $w$**\n\nThe mesh velocity, denoted by $w$, is defined as the velocity of the computational grid points. In the ALE formulation, the grid points are identified by their fixed reference coordinate $X$. Therefore, the mesh velocity is the time derivative of the spatial position $x$ of a mesh point, holding its reference coordinate $X$ constant.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$w(X,t) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\chi(X,t)}{\\partial t} \\right|_{X}$$\nUsing the given mapping $\\chi(X,t) = X + \\alpha X t$, we compute the partial derivative with respect to $t$:\n$$w(X,t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (X + \\alpha X t) = 0 + \\alpha X = \\alpha X$$\nThe problem requires the mesh velocity to be expressed as a function of the current spatial coordinate $x$ and time $t$, i.e., $w(x,t)$. To achieve this, we must eliminate the reference coordinate $X$ from our expression for $w$. From the first part of our derivation, we have the relationship:\n$$x = X(1 + \\alpha t)$$\nSolving for $X$, we get:\n$$X = \\frac{x}{1 + \\alpha t}$$\nThis expression for $X$ is valid for $1 + \\alpha t > 0$, which is true since $\\alpha > 0$ and typically time $t \\ge 0$. Substituting this into the expression for $w(X,t)$:\n$$w(x,t) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{x}{1 + \\alpha t} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha x}{1 + \\alpha t}$$\nThis is the required expression for the mesh velocity in the spatial frame.\n\n**3. Derivation of the relative (advective) velocity $a$**\n\nThe relative velocity, also known as the advective velocity, is the velocity of the material relative to the moving mesh. It is defined as the difference between the material velocity $u$ and the mesh velocity $w$.\n$$a = u - w$$\nThe problem provides the material velocity field in the spatial configuration:\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{\\alpha x}{1+\\alpha t} + U_0 \\exp(-\\beta t)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L(1+\\alpha t)}\\right)$$\nFrom our previous derivation, we have the mesh velocity:\n$$w(x,t) = \\frac{\\alpha x}{1 + \\alpha t}$$\nNow we can compute the relative velocity $a(x,t)$ by subtracting $w$ from $u$:\n$$a(x,t) = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha x}{1+\\alpha t} + U_0 \\exp(-\\beta t)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L(1+\\alpha t)}\\right) \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\alpha x}{1 + \\alpha t} \\right)$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\alpha x}{1+\\alpha t}$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$a(x,t) = U_0 \\exp(-\\beta t)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L(1+\\alpha t)}\\right)$$\nThis is the final simplified expression for the relative velocity.\n\nThe three derived quantities are:\n- $x = X(1 + \\alpha t)$\n- $w = \\frac{\\alpha x}{1 + \\alpha t}$\n- $a = U_0 \\exp(-\\beta t)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L(1+\\alpha t)}\\right)$\n\nThese will be presented in a row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nX(1 + \\alpha t) & \\frac{\\alpha x}{1 + \\alpha t} & U_0 \\exp(-\\beta t)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L(1+\\alpha t)}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3496252"}, {"introduction": "Once the distinct velocity fields are understood, the next step is to analyze their impact on the rates of change of physical quantities.

Thus, $\\sin(\\pi X) = \\sqrt{2}/2$, $\\cos(\\pi X) = \\sqrt{2}/2$, $\\sin(2\\pi X) = 1$, $\\cos(2\\pi X) = 0$.\n- $t = 0.7$, $\\omega = 3 \\implies \\omega t = 2.1$. So, $\\exp(-0.7) \\approx 0.496585$, $\\sin(2.1) \\approx 0.863209$, $\\cos(2.1) \\approx -0.504846$.\n\nNow we compute the values of the physical fields and their derivatives:\n- $J = 1 + 2\\pi a\\cos(2\\pi X)\\sin(\\omega t) = 1 + 2\\pi(0.1)(0)\\sin(2.1) = 1$. This greatly simplifies the calculation.\n- $U = \\sin(\\pi/4)\\exp(-0.7) \\approx (\\sqrt{2}/2)(0.496585) \\approx 0.351140$.\n- $w = a\\omega\\sin(2\\pi X)\\cos(\\omega t) = (0.1)(3)(1)\\cos(2.1) \\approx -0.151454$.\n- $\\partial U/\\partial t = -U \\approx -0.351140$.\n- $\\partial U/\\partial X = \\pi\\cos(\\pi/4)\\exp(-0.7) = \\pi U / \\tan(\\pi/4) = \\pi U \\approx \\pi(0.351140) \\approx 1.103133$.\n- $\\partial J/\\partial X = -4\\pi^2 a\\sin(2\\pi X)\\sin(\\omega t) = -4\\pi^2(0.1)(1)\\sin(2.1) \\approx -3.40790$.\n- $\\partial^2 U/\\partial X^2 = -\\pi^2\\sin(\\pi/4)\\exp(-0.7) = -\\pi^2 U \\approx -9.8696(0.351140) \\approx -3.46553$.\n\nWith $J=1$, the source term expression becomes:\n$$\nS(X,t) = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} + (U-w)\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X} - \\nu\\left(-\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial X}\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X} + \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial X^2}\\right)\n$$\nWe substitute the numerical values:\n- Convective part: $C = \\partial U/\\partial t + (U-w)\\partial U/\\partial X \\approx -0.351140 + (0.351140 - (-0.151454))(1.103133) \\approx -0.351140 + 0.554432 \\approx 0.203292$.\n- Viscous part to be subtracted: $D = \\nu(-\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial X}\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X} + \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial X^2}) \\approx 0.05(-(-3.40790)(1.103133) + (-3.46553)) \\approx 0.05(3.75945 - 3.46553) \\approx 0.05(0.29392) \\approx 0.014696$.\n\nFinally, the value of the source term is:\n$$\nS = C - D \\approx 0.203292 - 0.014696 = 0.188596\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1886$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1886}$$", "id": "3496260"}]}
