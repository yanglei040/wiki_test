This analysis will allow us to assess the relative importance of pressure-gradient-driven convection versus ionic migration as a transport mechanism.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical expressions for the two fluxes based on fundamental principles of transport phenomena in porous media and electrochemistry.\n\nThe electrolyte convective salt flux, $\\mathbf{N}_{conv}$, represents the transport of the salt due to the bulk motion of the solvent (the electrolyte). This bulk fluid velocity, $\\mathbf{v}$, in a porous medium is described by Darcy's law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla p\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the permeability of the porous medium, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the electrolyte, and $\\nabla p$ is the pressure gradient.

This flux arises from the motion of cations (Li$^+$) under the influence of an electric field. The problem specifies this as the flux \"carried by the ionic current\". The total ionic current density in the electrolyte is $\\mathbf{i}_e$. The fraction of this current carried by the cations is determined by the cationic transference number, $t_+$. Thus, the current density associated with the cations is $\\mathbf{i}_+ = t_+ \\mathbf{i}_e$. To convert this charge flux (current density) into a molar flux, we divide by the charge per mole of cations, which is $z_+ F$, where $z_+$ is the charge number of the cation and $F$ is the Faraday constant. For a Lithium-ion battery, the cation is Li$^+$, so $z_+ = 1$. The molar flux of cations due to migration is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}_{+,mig} = \\frac{t_+ \\mathbf{i}_e}{z_+ F} = \\frac{t_+ \\mathbf{i}_e}{F}\n$$\nThe magnitude of this flux is:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{N}_{+,mig}| = \\frac{t_+ |\\mathbf{i}_e|}{F}\n$$\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as the magnitude of the convective flux to the magnitude of the cationic migrative flux:\n$$\nR = \\frac{|\\mathbf{N}_{conv}|}{|\\mathbf{N}_{+,mig}|} = \\frac{c_e \\frac{k}{\\mu} |\\nabla p|}{\\frac{t_+ |\\mathbf{i}_e|}{F}}\n$$\nRearranging this expression gives the final symbolic form for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{c_e k F |\\nabla p|}{\\mu t_+ |\\mathbf{i}_e|}\n$$\n\nTo evaluate $R$, we first need to determine the ionic current density $|\\mathbf{i}_e|$.

This result indicates that the magnitude of the convective salt flux driven by the pressure gradient is less than $1\\%$ of the magnitude of the cationic migrative flux. Therefore, for typical LIB operating conditions ($1\\,\\mathrm{C}$ rate), the contribution of Darcy flow to the overall ion transport is negligible compared to the contribution from ionic migration.
