The half-bandwidth $b$ of a matrix $A$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer such that $A_{ij}=0$ for all $i, j$ where $|i-j|b$. The matrices are of size $N \\times N$, corresponding to the $N$ interior grid points.\n\nFirst, we analyze the explicit fourth-order scheme. The discrete approximation of the second derivative at an interior node $x_i$ is given by:\n$$u''(x_{i})\\approx\\frac{-\\,u_{i-2}+16\\,u_{i-1}-30\\,u_{i}+16\\,u_{i+1}-u_{i+2}}{12\\,h^{2}}$$\nSubstituting this into the Poisson equation, $-u''(x_i) = f(x_i)$, we obtain the linear equation for the $i$-th row of the system:\n$$-\\left(\\frac{-\\,u_{i-2}+16\\,u_{i-1}-30\\,u_{i}+16\\,u_{i+1}-u_{i+2}}{12\\,h^{2}}\\right) = f_i$$\nMultiplying by $12\\,h^2$ and rearranging gives the structure of the $i$-th row of the system $A_{\\mathrm{exp}}\\boldsymbol{u}=\\boldsymbol{f}'$:\n$$u_{i-2} - 16\\,u_{i-1} + 30\\,u_i - 16\\,u_{i+1} + u_{i+2} = 12\\,h^2 f_i$$\nThe left-hand side of this equation defines the entries of the matrix $A_{\\mathrm{exp}}$. For the $i$-th row, the coefficients of the unknowns $u_j$ are non-zero only for $j = i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+2$. These indices correspond to the columns of the matrix $A_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ that have non-zero entries in row $i$. The absolute differences between the row index $i$ and the column indices $j$ are $|i-(i-2)|=2$, $|i-(i-1)|=1$, $|i-i|=0$, $|i-(i+1)|=1$, and $|i-(i+2)|=2$. The maximum value of $|i-j|$ for which $A_{\\mathrm{exp}, ij}$ is non-zero is $2$.\nBy the definition of half-bandwidth, $b_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ is the maximum such value over all rows. The problem states that boundary closures do not increase the stencil reach, so the interior stencil determines the global bandwidth. Thus, the half-bandwidth of the explicit matrix is $b_{\\mathrm{exp}}=2$.\n\nThe problem also defines the stencil half-width $s = (w-1)/2$, where $w$ is the number of grid points in the coupling. For the explicit scheme, the stencil couples $5$ points of $\\boldsymbol{u}$ ($u_{i-2}, u_{i-1}, u_i, u_{i+1}, u_{i+2}$), so its width is $w_{\\mathrm{exp}}=5$. The corresponding stencil half-width is $s_{\\mathrm{exp}} = (5-1)/2 = 2$. Therefore, we find that $b_{\\mathrm{exp}} = s_{\\mathrm{exp}}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the compact fourth-order scheme. The scheme is defined implicitly by:\n$$\\frac{1}{12}\\,u''_{i-1}+u''_{i}+\\frac{1}{12}\\,u''_{i+1}=\\frac{u_{i-1}-2\\,u_{i}+u_{i+1}}{h^{2}}$$\nWe use the physical relation $u''_j = -f_j$ to eliminate the second derivative terms:\n$$\\frac{1}{12}(-f_{i-1}) - f_i - \\frac{1}{12}(f_{i+1}) = \\frac{u_{i-1}-2\\,u_{i}+u_{i+1}}{h^{2}}$$\nTo form the linear system $A_{\\mathrm{comp}}\\boldsymbol{u}=\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{f}}$, we arrange the equation to have terms involving the unknown vector $\\boldsymbol{u}$ on the left-hand side and known terms on the right-hand side. Multiplying by $-h^2$ and rearranging gives:\n$$ -u_{i-1} + 2u_i - u_{i+1} = h^2 \\left( f_i + \\frac{1}{12}(f_{i-1} + f_{i+1}) \\right) $$\nThis equation defines the $i$-th row of the system. The left-hand side shows that for the $i$-th row of the matrix $A_{\\mathrm{comp}}$, the non-zero entries correspond to columns $j = i-1, i, i+1$.\nThe absolute differences between the row and column indices are $|i-(i-1)|=1$, $|i-i|=0$, and $|i-(i+1)|=1$. The maximum value of $|i-j|$ for which $A_{\\mathrm{comp}, ij}$ is non-zero is $1$.\nThe resulting matrix $A_{\\mathrm{comp}}$ is tridiagonal. Therefore, its half-bandwidth is $b_{\\mathrm{comp}}=1$.\n\nTo relate this to the stencil half-width, we examine the coupling of the unknowns $\\boldsymbol{u}$ in the final equation. The stencil couples $3$ points ($u_{i-1}, u_i, u_{i+1}$), so its width is $w_{\\mathrm{comp}}=3$. The corresponding stencil half-width is $s_{\\mathrm{comp}} = (3-1)/2 = 1$. As with the explicit case, we find that $b_{\\mathrm{comp}} = s_{\\mathrm{comp}}$.\n\nIn summary, the half-bandwidth for the explicit scheme is $b_{\\mathrm{exp}}=2$, and for the compact scheme, it is $b_{\\mathrm{comp}}=1$.

This is true.\n-   For $i=2, \\dots, n-1$: We must check if $|A_{ii}|  |A_{i,i-1}| + |A_{i,i+1}|$.\n    $|A_{ii}| = \\frac{2k}{h} + \\sigma h$.\n    $|A_{i,i-1}| + |A_{i,i+1}| = |-\\frac{k}{h}| + |-\\frac{k}{h}| = \\frac{2k}{h}$.\n    The inequality is $\\frac{2k}{h} + \\sigma h  \\frac{2k}{h}$, which simplifies to $\\sigma h  0$. This is true.\n\nThus, $A$ is strictly diagonally dominant by rows. The dominance margin for each row is $|A_{ii}| - \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}|$.\nFor $i=1,n$, the margin is $(\\frac{2k}{h} + \\sigma h) - \\frac{k}{h} = \\frac{k}{h} + \\sigma h$.\nFor $i=2, \\dots, n-1$, the margin is $(\\frac{2k}{h} + \\sigma h) - \\frac{2k}{h} = \\sigma h$.\nThe overall row dominance margin is $\\min(\\frac{k}{h} + \\sigma h, \\sigma h) = \\sigma h$.\n\nSince $A$ is symmetric, it is also strictly diagonally dominant by columns with the same margin.\n\nFor GEPP, at each step $k$, the pivot is chosen as the element $a_{mk}^{(k-1)}$ with the largest magnitude in the current column, where $m \\ge k$. A row-swap occurs if $m \\neq k$. A well-known property of SDD matrices is that they remain SDD throughout Gaussian elimination. For any SDD matrix, the diagonal element is strictly the largest in magnitude in its row and column. Specifically, for column $j$, $|A_{jj}|  \\sum_{i \\ne j} |A_{ij}| \\ge |A_{ij}|$ for any $i \\ne j$. This property is inherited by the active submatrix at every step of elimination. Therefore, at step $k$, the pivot candidate $a_{kk}^{(k-1)}$ will be strictly greater in magnitude than any sub-diagonal element $a_{ik}^{(k-1)}$ for $ik$. Consequently, GEPP will always select the diagonal element as the pivot, and no row exchanges will occur. The condition for this is that the matrix $A$ is SDD, which we have shown to be true for any $k0$, $\\sigma0$, and $h0$.\n\n### Part 3: Element Growth Factor\n\nThe element growth factor $\\gamma$ is defined as $\\gamma=\\dfrac{\\max_{i,j,k}|a_{ij}^{(k)}|}{\\max_{i,j}|a_{ij}|}$, where $a_{ij}^{(k)}$ are the entries of the matrix after step $k$ of elimination, and $a_{ij} = a_{ij}^{(0)}$ are the original entries.\n\nThe argument proceeds in several steps:\n1.  **A is Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD):** We have already shown $A$ is symmetric. A real, symmetric, strictly diagonally dominant matrix with positive diagonal entries is positive definite. To prove this, we use the Gershgorin Circle Theorem, which states that all eigenvalues of $A$ are contained in the union of disks $D_i = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - A_{ii}| \\le R_i \\}$, where $R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}|$. Since $A$ is symmetric, its eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are real.\n    The smallest possible eigenvalue $\\lambda_{min}$ is bounded by $\\lambda_{min} \\ge \\min_i(A_{ii} - R_i)$.\n    $A_{ii} = \\frac{2k}{h} + \\sigma h$.\n    For $i=1,n$, $R_i = \\frac{k}{h}$. So, $A_{ii} - R_i = \\frac{k}{h} + \\sigma h$.\n    For $i=2, \\dots, n-1$, $R_i = \\frac{2k}{h}$. So, $A_{ii} - R_i = \\sigma h$.\n    The minimum of these is $\\sigma h$. Since $\\sigma0$ and $h0$, we have $\\lambda_{min} \\ge \\sigma h  0$. All eigenvalues of $A$ are positive, so $A$ is SPD.\n\n2.  **Element Growth in SPD Matrices:** For an SPD matrix, it can be proven that Gaussian elimination without pivoting does not lead to element growth. The magnitude of any element in any intermediate matrix does not exceed the magnitude of the largest element in the original matrix.\n    The proof sketch is as follows:\n    (a) The active submatrix at any step $k$ of GE on an SPD matrix is also SPD.\n    (b) The element of largest magnitude in any SPD matrix must lie on the diagonal. Proof: Let $A$ be SPD and assume $|a_{ij}|$ is the largest element for $i \\ne j$. The principal $2 \\times 2$ submatrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{ii}  a_{ij} \\\\ a_{ji}  a_{jj} \\end{pmatrix}$ must also be SPD. This requires $a_{ii}a_{jj} - a_{ij}^2  0$. However, if $|a_{ij}|$ is the maximal element, then $|a_{ij}| \\ge a_{ii}$ and $|a_{ij}| \\ge a_{jj}$ (since diagonal elements of an SPD matrix are positive). This leads to $a_{ij}^2 \\ge a_{ii}a_{jj}$, a contradiction. Thus, the maximal element must be on the diagonal.\n    (c) At step $k$, let an element of the active submatrix be updated: $a_{ij}^{(k)} = a_{ij}^{(k-1)} - \\frac{a_{ik}^{(k-1)} a_{kj}^{(k-1)}}{a_{kk}^{(k-1)}}$. The new active submatrix is $A^{(k)}$. From (b), its largest element is on its diagonal, say $a_{ll}^{(k)}$.\n    (d) Consider this diagonal element: $a_{ll}^{(k)} = a_{ll}^{(k-1)} - \\frac{(a_{lk}^{(k-1)})^2}{a_{kk}^{(k-1)}}$. Since a submatrix of an SPD matrix is SPD, the active submatrix $A^{(k-1)}$ is SPD. Its maximal element is on its diagonal, so $a_{kk}^{(k-1)} \\ge |a_{lk}^{(k-1)}|$. This implies $a_{ll}^{(k)} \\le a_{ll}^{(k-1)}$. The diagonal entries (and therefore the maximal element) of the active submatrices do not increase.\n\n3.  **Calculation of $\\gamma$**: The property that element magnitudes do not grow implies that $\\max_{i,j,k}|a_{ij}^{(k)}| = \\max_{i,j}|a_{ij}^{(0)}|$.\n    Therefore, the growth factor is:\n    $$\n    \\gamma = \\frac{\\max_{i,j,k}|a_{ij}^{(k)}|}{\\max_{i,j}|a_{ij}^{(0)}|} = \\frac{\\max_{i,j}|a_{ij}^{(0)}|}{\\max_{i,j}|a_{ij}^{(0)}|} = 1\n    $$\n    The maximum element in the original matrix is on the diagonal, $\\max_{i,j}|a_{ij}| = A_{11} = \\frac{2k}{h} + \\sigma h$. The maximum element at any stage of elimination will not exceed this value. The growth factor is thus exactly $1$. This result is independent of the parameters $k$, $h$, and $\\sigma$, provided they meet the problem's criteria ($k0, \\sigma0, h0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3294727"}]}
