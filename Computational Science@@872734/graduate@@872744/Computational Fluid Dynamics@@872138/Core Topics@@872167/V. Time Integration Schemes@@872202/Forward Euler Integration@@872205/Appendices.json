A Taylor series expansion around $\\theta=0$ gives:\n$$ \\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta) = i\\theta - \\frac{i}{24}\\theta^3 - \\frac{1}{80}\\theta^4 + O(\\theta^5) $$\nThe symbol's real and imaginary parts for small $\\theta$ are:\n$$ \\Re(\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)) \\approx -\\frac{1}{80}\\theta^4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Im(\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)) \\approx \\theta $$\nThe eigenvalue of the semi-discrete operator is $\\lambda(\\theta) = -\\frac{a}{\\Delta x}\\Phi(\\theta)$. Its real part is:\n$$ \\Re(\\lambda(\\theta)) = -\\frac{a}{\\Delta x}\\Re(\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)) \\approx -\\frac{a}{\\Delta x}\\left(-\\frac{1}{80}\\theta^4\\right) = +\\frac{a}{80\\Delta x}\\theta^4 $$\nFor any small non-zero $\\theta$, $\\Re(\\lambda(\\theta)) > 0$. This means that the spatial discretization itself is intrinsically unstable, causing long-wavelength modes to grow exponentially. The stability region of the Forward Euler method lies entirely in the left-half of the complex plane (i.e., requires $\\Re(z) \\le 0$ for its argument $z=\\lambda\\Delta t$, except for the point $z=0$). Since our operator produces eigenvalues $\\lambda(\\theta)$ with positive real parts, the scaled eigenvalues $z(\\theta)$ will also have positive real parts, lying outside the stability region. Thus, the scheme is unconditionally unstable for any $\\nu > 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe must find the tightest upper bound on $\\nu$ that ensures stability for all three discretizations simultaneously.
