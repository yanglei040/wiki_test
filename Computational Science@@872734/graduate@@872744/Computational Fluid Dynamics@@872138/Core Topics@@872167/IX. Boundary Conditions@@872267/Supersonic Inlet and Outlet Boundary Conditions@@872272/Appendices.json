Let the state vector be $U = [\\rho, \\rho u, E]^T$, where $\\rho$ is the density in $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $u$ is the velocity in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, and $E$ is the total energy per unit volume in $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$. The pressure $p$ is related to $E$ and $u$ by the ideal gas relation $p = (\\gamma - 1)\\left(E - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho u^2\\right)$, where $\\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats (dimensionless).

The one-dimensional Euler equations in conservation form are $\\partial_t U + \\partial_x F(U) = 0$.\n\nYou are to implement the Finite Volume Method (FVM) using ghost-cell construction to handle supersonic inlet and outlet boundary conditions. The numerical flux at an interface between a left state $U_L$ and a right state $U_R$ must be the local Lax-Friedrichs (also known as Rusanov) flux:\n$$\nF_{LF}(U_L, U_R) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(F(U_L) + F(U_R)\\right) - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\alpha\\left(U_R - U_L\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = \\max\\left(|u_L| + a_L, |u_R| + a_R\\right)$ and $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma p / \\rho}$ is the speed of sound.

It is scientifically grounded in the Euler equations for one-dimensional inviscid compressible flow and specifies a standard numerical method (Finite Volume Method with Rusanov flux) and boundary condition treatment (ghost cells for supersonic flow). All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and the requested computations are clearly defined. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws were identified. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to compute the numerical mass flux across the left (supersonic inlet) and right (supersonic outlet) boundaries of a computational domain for three distinct test cases. The mass flux is the first component of the vector-valued Local Lax-Friedrichs (Rusanov) numerical flux, $F_{LF}$.\n\nThe Rusanov flux at an interface between a left state $U_L$ and a right state $U_R$ is given by:\n$$\nF_{LF}(U_L, U_R) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(F(U_L) + F(U_R)\\right) - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\alpha\\left(U_R - U_L\\right)\n$$\nwhere $F(U)$ is the physical flux vector, $U$ is the vector of conserved variables, and $\\alpha$ is the local dissipation coefficient. The state vector is $U = [\\rho, \\rho u, E]^T$, and the physical flux vector is $F(U) = [\\rho u, \\rho u^2 + p, u(E + p)]^T$. We are interested in the first component of $F_{LF}$, which represents the mass flux, $f_m$. Let $U_1 = \\rho$ and $F_1(U) = \\rho u$. The mass flux is:\n$$\nf_{m,LF} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(F_1(U_L) + F_1(U_R)\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha\\left(U_{R,1} - U_{L,1}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions for the first components, this becomes:\n$$\nf_{m,LF} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\rho_L u_L + \\rho_R u_R\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha\\left(\\rho_R - \\rho_L\\right)\n$$\nThe dissipation coefficient $\\alpha$ is defined as the maximum characteristic speed at the interface:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\max\\left(|u_L| + a_L, |u_R| + a_R\\right)\n$$\nwhere $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma p / \\rho}$ is the speed of sound. The primitive variables $(\\rho, u, p)$ for the left ($L$) and right ($R$) states are determined by the ghost cell boundary conditions.\n\n**Boundary Conditions:**\n1.  **Supersonic Inlet (Left Boundary):** The interface is between the left ghost cell and the first interior cell.\n    -   State $L$ (ghost cell): The primitive variables are set to the specified inlet conditions, $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L) = (\\rho_{in}, u_{in}, p_{in})$.\n    -   State $R$ (first interior cell): The primitive variables are taken from the specified interior state, $(\\rho_R, u_R, p_R) = (\\rho_{int}, u_{int}, p_{int})$.\n\n2.  **Supersonic Outlet (Right Boundary):** The interface is between the last interior cell and the right ghost cell.\n    -   State $L$ (last interior cell): The primitive variables are from the interior state, $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L) = (\\rho_{int}, u_{int}, p_{int})$.\n    -   State $R$ (ghost cell): The primitive variables are copied from the last interior cell, so $(\\rho_R, u_R, p_R) = (\\rho_{int}, u_{int}, p_{int})$.\n    For this case, since $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L) = (\\rho_R, u_R, p_R)$, the Rusanov mass flux simplifies significantly. The dissipation term vanishes as $\\rho_R - \\rho_L = 0$. The flux term becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(\\rho_L u_L + \\rho_L u_L) = \\rho_L u_L$. Thus, for the supersonic outlet, the numerical mass flux is simply the physical mass flux evaluated at the interior state: $f_m = \\rho_{int} u_{int}$.\n\nWe now apply this methodology to each test case.\n\n**Test Case 1**\n-   Given: $\\gamma = 1.4$.\n-   Inlet primitives: $\\rho_{in} = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $u_{in} = 600.0$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $p_{in} = 120000.0$ $\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Interior primitives: $\\rho_{int} = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $u_{int} = 580.0$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $p_{int} = 110000.0$ $\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\n**Left Boundary Mass Flux, $f_{m,L}^{(1)}$:**\n-   State $L$: $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L) = (1.0, 600.0, 120000.0)$.\n-   State $R$: $(\\rho_R, u_R, p_R) = (1.0, 580.0, 110000.0)$.\n-   Speeds of sound:\n    -   $a_L = \\sqrt{1.4 \\cdot 120000.0 / 1.0} = \\sqrt{168000} \\approx 409.878$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n    -   $a_R = \\sqrt{1.4 \\cdot 110000.0 / 1.0} = \\sqrt{154000} \\approx 392.428$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n-   Dissipation coefficient:\n    -   $|u_L| + a_L = 600.0 + 409.878 = 1009.878$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n    -   $|u_R| + a_R = 580.0 + 392.428 = 972.428$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n    -   $\\alpha = \\max(1009.878, 972.428) = 1009.878$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n-   Rusanov mass flux:\n    -   $f_{m,L}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}(1.0 \\cdot 600.0 + 1.0 \\cdot 580.0) - \\frac{1}{2}(1009.878)(1.0 - 1.0) = \\frac{1}{2}(1180.0) - 0 = 590.0$ $\\mathrm{kg/(m^2\\cdot s)}$.\n\n**Right Boundary Mass Flux, $f_{m,R}^{(1)}$:**\n-   Using the simplification for supersonic outlets:\n    -   $f_{m,R}^{(1)} = \\rho_{int} u_{int} = 1.0 \\cdot 580.0 = 580.0$ $\\mathrm{kg/(m^2\\cdot s)}$.\n\n**Test Case 2**\n-   Given: $\\gamma = 1.4$.\n-   Inlet primitives: $\\rho_{in} = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $u_{in} = \\sqrt{1.4 \\cdot 100000.0} \\approx 374.166$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $p_{in} = 100000.0$ $\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Interior primitives: $\\rho_{int} = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $u_{int} = 400.0$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $p_{int} = 80000.0$ $\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\n**Left Boundary Mass Flux, $f_{m,L}^{(2)}$:**\n-   State $L$: $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L) = (1.0, \\sqrt{140000}, 100000.0)$.\n-   State $R$: $(\\rho_R, u_R, p_R) = (1.0, 400.0, 80000.0)$.\n-   Speeds of sound:\n    -   $a_L = \\sqrt{1.4 \\cdot 100000.0 / 1.0} = \\sqrt{140000} \\approx 374.166$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$.

Let the primitive state adjacent to the outlet inside the domain be $(\\rho, u_n, p)$, where $\\rho$ is density, $u_n$ is the velocity component normal to the outlet (positive when pointing out of the domain), and $p$ is static pressure.

The analysis is based on the theory of characteristics for the compressible Euler equations.\n\n### Principle-Based Design: Characteristic Analysis\n\nThe foundation of hyperbolic partial differential equations, such as the Euler equations, is the method of characteristics. For the one-dimensional Euler equations, there are three characteristic waves that propagate information through the fluid. At a computational boundary, the direction of this propagation determines whether information is needed from outside the domain (a boundary condition) or if the state is determined by the flow inside the domain.\n\nThe propagation speeds of these waves, relative to the stationary boundary, are given by the eigenvalues of the system Jacobian matrix. For a boundary with an outward-pointing normal vector, and with fluid properties $(\\rho, u_n, p)$ representing density, normal velocity, and pressure, these eigenvalues are:\n- $\\lambda_1 = u_n - a$\n- $\\lambda_2 = u_n$\n- $\\lambda_3 = u_n + a$\n\nHere, $u_n$ is the velocity component normal to the outlet (positive for outflow), and $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma p / \\rho}$ is the local speed of sound. A negative eigenvalue ($\\lambda_i < 0$) signifies a characteristic wave propagating into the computational domain, thus requiring a boundary condition to be supplied. A positive eigenvalue ($\\lambda_i > 0$) signifies a wave propagating out of the domain, carrying information from the interior. The number of required boundary conditions, $n_{\\text{in}}$, is therefore the number of negative eigenvalues.\n\nThe flow regime at the outlet is classified by the normal Mach number, $M_n = u_n/a$. We analyze the sign of the eigenvalues for each regime:\n\n1.  **Supersonic Outflow ($u_n > 0, M_n > 1$)**: Since $u_n > a$, all three eigenvalues are positive: $\\lambda_1 = u_n - a > 0$, $\\lambda_2 = u_n > 0$, $\\lambda_3 = u_n + a > 0$. All information propagates out of the domain. Thus, $n_{\\text{in}} = 0$, and no boundary conditions are imposed. The state at the boundary is determined entirely by the interior flow, typically by extrapolation.\n\n2.  **Subsonic Outflow ($u_n > 0, 0 < M_n < 1$)**: Since $0 < u_n < a$, we have $\\lambda_1 = u_n - a < 0$, $\\lambda_2 = u_n > 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = u_n + a > 0$. One characteristic enters the domain. Thus, $n_{\\text{in}} = 1$, and one scalar boundary condition must be provided. For subsonic outlets, it is common to prescribe the static pressure $p_{\\text{bc}} = p_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\n3.  **Subsonic Inflow ($u_n < 0, |M_n| < 1$)**: Since $-a < u_n < 0$, we have $\\lambda_1 = u_n - a < 0$, $\\lambda_2 = u_n < 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = u_n + a > 0$. Two characteristics enter the domain. Thus, $n_{\\text{in}} = 2$, and two scalar conditions are required. These are typically provided from a far-field or reservoir state.\n\n4.  **Supersonic Inflow ($u_n < 0, |M_n| > 1$)**: Since $u_n < -a$, all three eigenvalues are negative: $\\lambda_1 = u_n - a < 0$, $\\lambda_2 = u_n < 0$, and $\\lambda_3 = u_n + a < 0$. All information propagates into the domain. Thus, $n_{\\text{in}} = 3$, and the entire flow state ($\\rho, u_n, p$) must be prescribed from a reservoir.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation based on Characteristics\n\nThe problem provides specific formulas to implement these conditions using characteristic variables called Riemann invariants ($w^+, w^-$) and entropy (via the isentropic constant $K = p/\\rho^\\gamma$).\n\n**Outflow ($u_n \\ge 0$):**\nA robust treatment must handle the transition between subsonic and supersonic outflow smoothly. The problem defines a blending approach using a switching function $s(M_n)$ in the trans-sonic region $M_{\\text{low}} < M_n < M_{\\text{up}}$, where $M_{\\text{low}} = 1 - \\delta$ and $M_{\\text{up}} = 1 + \\delta$.\nThe boundary state $(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{bc}}$ is a weighted average:\n$$(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{bc}} = (1-s(M_n))(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{sup}} + s(M_n)(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{sub}}$$\n-   The supersonic state $(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{sup}}$ is simply the extrapolated interior state $(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{int}}$, consistent with $n_{\\text{in}}=0$.\n-   The subsonic state $(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{sub}}$ is calculated by imposing one condition ($p_{\\text{sub}} = p_{\\text{ref}}$) and using information from the two outgoing characteristics from the interior. This is accomplished by conserving the Riemann invariant $w^+ = u_n + \\frac{2a}{\\gamma-1}$ and the isentropic constant $K = p/\\rho^\\gamma$ from the interior state. With $p_{\\text{sub}}$ and $K_{\\text{int}}$ known, $\\rho_{\\text{sub}}$ and $a_{\\text{sub}}$ are found. Then, $u_{n,\\text{sub}}$ is found from the conserved $w^+_{\\text{int}}$.\n\n**Inflow ($u_n < 0$):**\n-   **Subsonic Inflow ($|M_n| < 1$, $n_{\\text{in}}=2$)**: Two conditions are needed. The boundary condition is constructed by taking the properties of the two incoming characteristics from the reservoir state $(\\rho_\\infty, u_{n,\\infty}, p_\\infty)$ and the one outgoing characteristic from the interior. This means the incoming Riemann invariant $w^- = u_n - \\frac{2a}{\\gamma-1}$ and the entropy (via $K$) are set to their reservoir values ($w^-_\\infty, K_\\infty$). The outgoing Riemann invariant $w^+$ is taken from the interior ($w^+_{\\text{int}}$). This provides a system of equations to solve for the boundary state $(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{bc}}$.\n-   **Supersonic Inflow ($|M_n| \\ge 1$, $n_{\\text{in}}=3$)**: All information comes from outside. The boundary state is simply set to the reservoir state: $(\\rho, u_n, p)_{\\text{bc}} = (\\rho_\\infty, u_{n,\\infty}, p_\\infty)$.\n\nThe following program implements this logic for the specified test cases. It first computes the interior Mach number $M_n$ and the number of incoming characteristics $n_{\\text{in}}$. Then, it applies the appropriate logic based on the sign of $u_n$ and the value of $M_n$ to determine the final boundary state.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Global constants from the problem statement\nGAMMA = 1.4\nDELTA = 0.05\nP_REF = 101325.0\nRHO_INF = 1.2\nU_N_INF = -200.0\nP_INF = 300000.0\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the mixed supersonic/subsonic outlet boundary condition problem\n    for a series of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    m_low = 1.0 - DELTA\n    m_up = 1.0 + DELTA\n\n    # Pre-calculate reservoir properties\n    a_inf = np.sqrt(GAMMA * P_INF / RHO_INF)\n    k_inf = P_INF / (RHO_INF**GAMMA)\n    w_minus_inf = U_N_INF - 2.0 * a_inf / (GAMMA - 1.0)\n    \n    # Define test cases.

You will simulate the dynamic interaction between a shock wave and the outlet boundary under a transient back-pressure load, using your solver to predict whether the engine can maintain stable operation. This exercise demonstrates the direct link between the rigorous implementation of boundary conditions and the ability to analyze and design complex aerospace systems. [@problem_id:3368199]", "problem": "Consider a constant-area isolator duct representative of a Supersonic Combustion Ramjet (SCRAMJET) inlet–isolator, modeled as a one-dimensional compressible flow governed by the inviscid Euler equations and an ideal gas equation of state. The task is to determine, by simulation and principled reasoning, which specified combinations of supersonic inlet and outlet boundary conditions suppress unstart when the outlet back pressure is ramped in time. The final answer must be a complete, runnable program.\n\nThe governing conservation laws for a calorically perfect gas are the one-dimensional Euler equations, expressed in conservative form for mass, momentum, and total energy. The ideal gas equation of state and definitions of primitive variables, sound speed, and Mach number apply. Supersonic inlet and outlet boundary conditions shall be enforced according to characteristic compatibility: at the supersonic inlet all characteristic information enters the domain, whereas at the outlet under subsonic conditions one characteristic enters and the static pressure can be prescribed. The computational method must be a consistent first-principles discretization that respects conservation, characteristic directions, and causality.\n\nYou must begin the derivation and algorithmic design from the following fundamental bases and well-tested facts:\n- The one-dimensional compressible Euler equations for a calorically perfect gas, with conservative state vector and fluxes defined in terms of density, velocity, pressure, and total energy, and the Ideal Gas Law with ratio of specific heats and gas constant.\n- The concept of characteristics in hyperbolic systems, including that at a supersonic inlet all characteristics point into the domain and all primitive variables may be prescribed; at a subsonic outlet one characteristic enters the domain and pressure may be prescribed consistently.\n- The normal shock relations in a constant-area duct for a calorically perfect gas, used to reason about the maximum downstream static pressure achievable for a given upstream supersonic Mach number without altering the upstream state.\n- The causality constraint that information cannot propagate upstream through a supersonic region via characteristics until a subsonic region is formed.\n\nThe program must implement a one-dimensional finite-volume Godunov-type solver with a robust approximate Riemann flux (for example, the Harten–Lax–van Leer–Einfeldt (HLLE) flux), a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition based time step, and physically consistent boundary conditions. The supersonic inlet boundary condition must prescribe the static state derived from given total conditions and inlet Mach number. The outlet boundary condition must prescribe a time-dependent static pressure ramp when the outlet is subsonic, and otherwise avoid imposing non-physical constraints. The computational domain is a constant-area duct of length $L$ discretized into $N$ uniform control volumes of size $\\Delta x$, and the integration runs to a specified final time $t_{\\text{final}}$.\n\nUnstart detection must be based on a physically meaningful criterion. Define unstart to have occurred if the Mach number in the cell adjacent to the inlet becomes strictly subsonic, i.e., less than $1$, and remains so for a sustained number of consecutive time steps during or after the outlet pressure ramp begins. Suppression of unstart is declared if unstart does not occur during the simulation time horizon. For numerical robustness, you must include floors for density and pressure to maintain positivity and use a moderate CFL number.\n\nAll physical quantities must be used and reported in International System of Units (SI units).

Set the outlet base static pressure $p_{\\text{out,base}} = p_1$. Define the outlet peak static pressure $p_{\\text{out,peak}} = 0.93\\,p_2$, where $p_2$ is the downstream static pressure immediately after a normal shock for an upstream Mach number $M_{\\text{in}}$ located at the duct exit in a constant-area duct.

Enforce the outlet pressure ramp by prescribing the static pressure at the right ghost cell, with velocity and density extrapolated from the last interior cell to maintain consistency, and computing the ghost cell total energy from the prescribed pressure and extrapolated velocity and density.\n- Detect unstart if the Mach number in the first interior cell adjacent to the inlet becomes below $1$ for at least $5$ consecutive time steps at any time $t \\ge 0$ while the ramp progresses. Otherwise declare unstart suppressed.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3,result4]\"), where each result is a boolean indicating whether unstart was suppressed (True) or not (False) for the corresponding test case, in the order listed above. All internal computations must consistently use SI units and the Ideal Gas Law for a calorically perfect gas.", "solution": "The problem of determining unstart suppression in a SCRAMJET isolator duct is a well-posed problem in computational gas dynamics. It is scientifically grounded in the one-dimensional Euler equations and the theory of hyperbolic partial differential equations. The provided parameters and conditions are complete, consistent, and physically realistic, allowing for a direct numerical simulation. We will proceed with a solution based on a first-principles finite-volume method.\n\n### 1. Governing Equations and State Variables\n\nThe flow is modeled by the one-dimensional Euler equations for an inviscid, compressible, calorically perfect gas. In conservative form, these are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U})}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $\\mathbf{U}$ is the vector of conserved quantities, and $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U})$ is the flux vector. They are defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{U} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\rho \\\\ \\rho u \\\\ E \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\rho u \\\\ \\rho u^2 + p \\\\ (E+p)u \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $u$ is the velocity, $p$ is the static pressure, and $E$ is the total energy per unit volume.\n\nThe system is closed using the ideal gas law and the definition of total energy:\n$$\np = \\rho R T\n$$\n$$\nE = \\rho e + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho u^2 = \\frac{p}{\\gamma-1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho u^2\n$$\nwhere $T$ is temperature, $R$ is the specific gas constant, $\\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats, and $e = c_v T$ is the specific internal energy. These relations allow for the conversion between the vector of conservative variables $\\mathbf{U} = [U_1, U_2, U_3]^T$ and the vector of primitive variables $\\mathbf{W} = [\\rho, u, p]^T$.\n\nConversion from conservative to primitive variables:\n$$\n\\rho = U_1, \\quad u = \\frac{U_2}{U_1}, \\quad p = (\\gamma-1)\\left(U_3 - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{U_2^2}{U_1}\\right)\n$$\nThe speed of sound, $a$, and Mach number, $M$, are given by:\n$$\na = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma p}{\\rho}}, \\quad M = \\frac{u}{a}\n$$\n\n### 2. Numerical Method: Finite-Volume Scheme\n\nWe employ a first-order finite-volume method. The duct of length $L$ is divided into $N$ cells, each of width $\\Delta x = L/N$. The semi-discretized Euler equations for the cell-averaged state $\\mathbf{U}_i$ in cell $i$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{U}_i}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}(\\mathbf{F}_{i+1/2} - \\mathbf{F}_{i-1/2})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{F}_{i\\pm 1/2}$ represents the numerical flux at the cell interfaces. We use a first-order forward Euler method for time integration:\n$$\n\\mathbf{U}_i^{n+1} = \\mathbf{U}_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}(\\mathbf{F}_{i+1/2}^n - \\mathbf{F}_{i-1/2}^n)\n$$\nThe time step $\\Delta t$ is dynamically calculated to satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for stability:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\text{CFL} \\cdot \\min_{i} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta x}{|u_i| + a_i} \\right)\n$$\nwhere the minimum is taken over all cells in the domain, and $\\text{CFL}$ is a number less than $1$ (given as $0.5$).\n\n### 3. HLLE Approximate Riemann Solver\n\nThe numerical flux $\\mathbf{F}_{i+1/2}$ at the interface between cell $i$ (left state $\\mathbf{U}_L = \\mathbf{U}_i$) and cell $i+1$ (right state $\\mathbf{U}_R = \\mathbf{U}_{i+1}$) is computed using the Harten-Lax-van Leer-Einfeldt (HLLE) scheme. This scheme is robust and guarantees positivity of density and pressure. The HLLE flux is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{HLLE}(\\mathbf{U}_L, \\mathbf{U}_R) = \\frac{S_R \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}_L) - S_L \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}_R) + S_L S_R (\\mathbf{U}_R - \\mathbf{U}_L)}{S_R - S_L}\n$$\nThe wave speed estimates, $S_L$ and $S_R$, are crucial. We use the Davis estimates, which are based on the left and right states adjacent to the interface:\n$$\nS_L = \\min(u_L - a_L, u_R - a_R)\n$$\n$$\nS_R = \\max(u_L + a_L, u_R + a_R)\n$$\n\n### 4. Initial and Boundary Conditions\n\nThe simulation requires specifying the initial state of the flow and the boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet.\n\n**Initial Conditions**: The duct is initialized with a uniform supersonic flow corresponding to the inlet conditions. Given total temperature $T_0$, total pressure $p_0$, and inlet Mach number $M_{\\text{in}}$, the static properties (denoted with subscript $1$) are found using isentropic flow relations:\n$$\nT_1 = \\frac{T_0}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\text{in}}^2}\n$$\n$$\np_1 = \\frac{p_0}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\text{in}}^2\\right)^{\\gamma/(\\gamma-1)}}\n$$\nFrom these, we compute $\\rho_1 = p_1 / (R T_1)$ and $u_1 = M_{\\text{in}} \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}$. The initial conservative state vector $\\mathbf{U}_{init}$ is then computed from $(\\rho_1, u_1, p_1)$ and applied to all $N$ cells.\n\n**Boundary Conditions**: We use ghost cells at both ends of the domain (cell $-1$ at the inlet, cell $N$ at the outlet) to enforce boundary conditions.\n\n- **Inlet (Supersonic)**: Since the inlet flow is supersonic ($M_{\\text{in}} > 1$), all three characteristics enter the domain. Thus, all flow properties can and must be specified. The state vector in the inlet ghost cell is fixed for all time:\n$$\n\\mathbf{U}_{-1}^n = \\mathbf{U}_{init} \\quad \\forall n\n$$\n\n- **Outlet**: The boundary condition at the outlet models the response to a downstream back pressure. As instructed, a pressure is prescribed at the outlet ghost cell. This represents the physical situation where the isolator exits into a plenum (the combustor) with a specified pressure. The ghost cell state $\\mathbf{U}_N^n$ is constructed as follows:\n    1. Prescribe the static pressure: $p_N^n = p_{\\text{out}}(t^n)$. The pressure ramp is given by:\n       $$\n       p_{\\text{out}}(t) = p_{\\text{out,base}} + (p_{\\text{out,peak}} - p_{\\text{out,base}}) \\min\\left(1, \\frac{t}{t_{\\text{ramp}}}\\right)\n       $$\n    2. Extrapolate density and velocity from the last interior cell ($i=N-1$):\n       $$\n       \\rho_N^n = \\rho_{N-1}^n, \\quad u_N^n = u_{N-1}^n\n       $$\n    3. Compute the ghost cell's total energy from its primitive variables:\n       $$\n       E_N^n = \\frac{p_N^n}{\\gamma-1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_N^n (u_N^n)^2\n       $$\nThis procedure correctly introduces the back pressure information into the domain via the Riemann problem solved at the outlet interface $x_{N-1/2}$.\n\n### 5. Unstart Criterion and Logic\n\nUnstart is a critical failure mode where the shock system is expelled from the inlet. This is triggered by an excessive back pressure causing a shock to propagate fully upstream. The maximum back pressure a supersonic flow can withstand in a constant-area duct without upstream influence is the static pressure after a normal shock, $p_2$. This is given by the Rankine-Hugoniot relation:\n$$\n\\frac{p_2}{p_1} = 1 + \\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma+1} (M_{\\text{in}}^2 - 1)\n$$\nThe test cases are defined relative to this pressure $p_2$.\n\nNumerically, unstart is detected if the flow in the first interior cell ($i=0$) becomes subsonic ($M_0 < 1$) and remains so for $5$ consecutive time steps. A counter tracks these consecutive subsonic steps. If the counter reaches $5$, an unstart flag is set, and the simulation for that test case terminates. If the simulation completes to $t_{\\text{final}}$ without this condition being met, unstart is considered suppressed.\n\nThe expected outcomes are:\n- **Case 1 ($p_{\\text{out,peak}} < p_2$)**: Unstart should be suppressed.\n- **Case 2 ($p_{\\text{out,peak}} > p_2$)**: Unstart is expected.\n- **Case 3 ($p_{\\text{out,peak}} > p_2$)**: With a lower inlet Mach number ($M_{\\text{in}}=1.5$), the system is less resilient to pressure disturbances. Unstart is expected.\n- **Case 4 ($p_{\\text{out,peak}} < p_2$)**: Although the inlet Mach number is high ($M_{\\text{in}}=2.5$), the applied back pressure is well below the theoretical limit $p_2$. The shock generated at the outlet should stabilize within the duct. Unstart should be suppressed.\n\nThe final program implements this entire logic, iterating through each test case and reporting the outcome.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the SCRAMJET unstart problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    class EulerSolver1D:\n        \"\"\"\n        A 1D Euler solver for simulating flow in a SCRAMJET isolator.\n        \"\"\"\n        def __init__(self, gamma, R, L, N, CFL, T0, p0, M_in, \n                     t_final, p_out_base_factor, p_out_peak_factor, t_ramp):\n            # Physical and numerical parameters\n            self.gamma = gamma\n            self.R = R\n            self.L = L\n            self.N = N\n            self.CFL = CFL\n            self.t_final = t_final\n            self.t_ramp = t_ramp\n\n            # Grid setup\n            self.dx = self.L / self.N\n            self.x = np.linspace(-self.dx / 2, self.L + self.dx / 2, self.N + 2)\n\n            # Initial and boundary condition parameters\n            self.T0 = T0\n            self.p0 = p0\n            self.M_in = M_in\n\n            # Derived initial conditions\n            self.T1 = self.T0 / (1 + (self.gamma -
