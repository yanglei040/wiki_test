Using the chain rule with $\\xi = y/\\delta$, we have $\\frac{dU}{dy} = \\frac{dU}{d\\xi} \\frac{d\\xi}{dy}$.\n\nThe derivative of the mean velocity profile $U(y) = u_{\\tau}\\,Re_{\\tau}\\,\\left[\\xi - \\frac{1+a}{2}\\,\\xi^{2} + \\frac{a}{3}\\,\\xi^{3}\\right]$ with respect to $\\xi$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{d\\xi} = u_{\\tau}\\,Re_{\\tau}\\,\\left[1 - (1+a)\\,\\xi + a\\,\\xi^{2}\\right] $$\nSince $\\frac{d\\xi}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\delta}$, the velocity gradient is:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dy} = \\frac{u_{\\tau}\\,Re_{\\tau}}{\\delta} \\left[1 - (1+a)\\,\\xi + a\\,\\xi^{2}\\right] $$\nNow, we can compute the normalized viscous stress:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}^{2}}\\frac{dU}{dy} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}^{2}} \\left( \\frac{u_{\\tau}\\,Re_{\\tau}}{\\delta} \\right) \\left[1 - (1+a)\\,\\xi + a\\,\\xi^{2}\\right] $$\nSubstituting the definition of the friction Reynolds number, $Re_{\\tau} = \\frac{u_{\\tau}\\delta}{\\nu}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}^{2}}\\frac{dU}{dy} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}^{2}} \\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\delta} \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}\\delta}{\\nu}\\right) \\left[1 - (1+a)\\,\\xi + a\\,\\xi^{2}\\right] $$\nThe terms involving flow parameters cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}^{2}}\\frac{dU}{dy} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu u_{\\tau}^2 \\delta}{\\nu u_{\\tau}^2 \\delta}\\right) \\left[1 - (1+a)\\,\\xi + a\\,\\xi^{2}\\right] = 1 - (1+a)\\,\\xi + a\\,\\xi^{2} $$\n\n**2.

We are given the profile $u'v'(y) = -u_{\\tau}^{2}\\,a\\,\\xi\\,(1-\\xi)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression:\n$$ \\frac{-u'v'}{u_{\\tau}^{2}} = \\frac{-\\left(-u_{\\tau}^{2}\\,a\\,\\xi\\,(1-\\xi)\\right)}{u_{\\tau}^{2}} = a\\,\\xi\\,(1-\\xi) = a\\xi - a\\xi^2 $$\n\n**3. Inconsistency Measure, D**\nThe quantity inside the absolute value in the definition of $D$ is the difference between the total stress calculated from the given profiles and the theoretical linear distribution. Let this difference be $f(\\xi)$:\n$$ f(\\xi) = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}^{2}}\\frac{dU}{dy} + \\frac{-u'v'}{u_{\\tau}^{2}}\\right) - (1-\\xi) $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ f(\\xi) = \\left(1 - (1+a)\\,\\xi + a\\,\\xi^{2}\\right) + \\left(a\\xi - a\\xi^2\\right) - (1-\\xi) $$\nNow, we simplify the expression by collecting terms with like powers of $\\xi$:\n$$ f(\\xi) = 1 - \\xi - a\\xi + a\\xi^2 + a\\xi - a\\xi^2 - 1 + \\xi $$\n$$ f(\\xi) = (1 - 1) + (-\\xi + \\xi) + (-a\\xi + a\\xi) + (a\\xi^2 - a\\xi^2) $$\n$$ f(\\xi) = 0 $$\nThe expression is identically zero for all values of $\\xi \\in [0, 1]$. This means the \"synthetic\" profiles provided are perfectly self-consistent and satisfy the RANS momentum balance exactly.\n\nThe inconsistency measure $D$ is the maximum of the absolute value of this expression over the domain:\n$$ D = \\max_{0 \\le \\xi \\le 1} |f(\\xi)| = \\max_{0 \\le \\xi \\le 1} |0| = 0 $$\nThe result is an exact analytical zero.

Feasibility Analysis**\n\nThe relationship between the first cell's viscous spacing, $\\Delta y_1^+$, and the stretching parameter, $\\beta$, is given by the equation:\n$$\nRe_\\tau\\,\\frac{\\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{N_y}\\right)}{\\sinh(\\beta)} = \\Delta y_1^+\n$$\nLet's analyze the function $f(\\beta) = \\dfrac{\\sinh(\\beta/N_y)}{\\sinh(\\beta)}$ for $\\beta \\ge 0$.\nUsing the Taylor series expansion $\\sinh(x) \\approx x$ for small $x$, the limit as $\\beta \\to 0$ is:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\beta \\to 0} f(\\beta) = \\lim_{\\beta \\to 0} \\frac{\\beta/N_y}{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{N_y}\n$$\nThis corresponds to a uniform grid, where each of the $N_y$ cells has a thickness of $\\Delta y = h/N_y$, resulting in a constant viscous spacing of $\\Delta y^+ = Re_\\tau (h/N_y)/h = Re_\\tau/N_y$.\nFor large $\\beta$, using the asymptotic behavior $\\sinh(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}e^x$ for $x > 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\beta \\to \\infty} f(\\beta) = \\lim_{\\beta \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}e^{\\beta/N_y}}{\\frac{1}{2}e^{\\beta}} = \\lim_{\\beta \\to \\infty} e^{\\beta(1/N_y - 1)} = 0 \\quad (\\text{since } N_y \\ge 1)\n$$\nThe function $f(\\beta)$ is monotonically decreasing for $\\beta>0$. Consequently, for the equation to have a solution for $\\beta \\ge 0$, the target value for the ratio, $\\Delta y_1^+ / Re_\\tau$, must lie in the range $(0, 1/N_y]$.

Determination of the Stretching Parameter $\\beta$**\n\nFor a feasible target $\\Delta y_1^+$, we must solve for $\\beta$.\n- If $\\Delta y_1^+ = Re_\\tau/N_y$, the grid is uniform, which corresponds to the boundary case $\\beta=0$.\n- If $0  \\Delta y_1^+  Re_\\tau/N_y$, we must find the unique positive root $\\beta > 0$ of the nonlinear transcendental equation:\n$$\ng(\\beta) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\beta/N_y)}{\\sinh(\\beta)} - \\frac{\\Delta y_1^+}{Re_\\tau} = 0\n$$\nThis is a root-finding problem.

We will bracket the search for $\\beta$ in a suitable interval, such as $[10^{-9}, 200]$, to ensure the solver finds the positive root.\n\n**3. Computation of the Spacing Distribution**\n\nOnce $\\beta$ is determined, we can compute the entire distribution of viscous-unit spacings, $\\Delta y_j^+$, for $j=1, \\dots, N_y$. The physical position of the $j$-th grid point is $y_j = y(\\eta_j;\\beta)$ where $\\eta_j = j/N_y$.

The identity $\\sinh(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2$ leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sinh(A)}{\\sinh(B)} = \\frac{e^A - e^{-A}}{e^B - e^{-B}} = e^{A-B} \\frac{1 - e^{-2A}}{1 - e^{-2B}}\n$$\nApplying this with $A = \\beta j/N_y$ and $B = \\beta$, we get a form that is numerically stable for all $\\beta > 0$:\n$$\n\\tilde{y}_j = e^{\\beta(j/N_y - 1)} \\frac{1 - e^{-2\\beta j/N_y}}{1 - e^{-2\\beta}}\n$$\nThe algorithm proceeds by first generating an array of physical positions $\\tilde{y}_j$ for $j=0, \\dots, N_y$ using this robust formula (or $\\tilde{y}_j = j/N_y$ if $\\beta=0$). Then, the spacings are computed by taking the difference of adjacent positions, $\\Delta\\tilde{y}_j = \\tilde{y}_j - \\tilde{y}_{j-1}$. Finally, these are scaled by $Re_\\tau$ to obtain the desired distribution $\\Delta y_j^+$.
