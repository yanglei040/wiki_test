This first exercise provides a concrete, hands-on calculation to build intuition for this mechanism, asking you to compute the neighbor coefficient for a convection-dominated scenario and interpret how the scheme suppresses numerical diffusion while maintaining stability through its upwind-biased convective term [@problem_id:3378097].", "problem": "Consider the steady one-dimensional convection–diffusion transport of a scalar field $\\phi(x)$ in a uniform grid within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Using the Finite Volume Method (FVM), focus on a control volume with centroid $P$ and its east face $e$ adjoining the neighbor node $E$. Let the east-face mass flux be $F_{e}$ and the diffusion conductance be $D_{e}$, so that the face Péclet number is $P_{e} = F_{e}/D_{e}$. In the power-law differencing scheme, the east-face neighbor coefficient $a_{E}$ comprises two parts: a diffusive contribution scaled by a suppression function of the Péclet number and an upwind convective contribution controlled by the sign of $F_{e}$.\n\nAssume $P_{e} = 5$ and that the mass flux is positive, $F_{e}  0$.

No rounding is required, and the quantity is dimensionless (no units).", "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the dimensionless neighbor coefficient $a_{E}/D_{e}$ for a specific case using the power-law differencing scheme in the context of the Finite Volume Method (FVM).\n\nThe problem states that the east-face neighbor coefficient $a_{E}$ is composed of a diffusive contribution and an upwind convective contribution. This can be written as:\n$$a_{E} = (\\text{diffusive contribution}) + (\\text{convective contribution})$$\n\nAccording to the problem description, these contributions are:\n1. Diffusive contribution: $D_{e} A(P_{e})$, where $A(P_{e})$ is a suppression function of the Péclet number $P_{e}$.\n2. Convective contribution: $\\max(-F_{e}, 0)$, which represents the upwind nature of the scheme. Here, $F_{e}$ is the mass flux at the east face.\n\nTherefore, the full expression for the neighbor coefficient $a_{E}$ is:\n$$a_{E} = D_{e} A(P_{e}) + \\max(-F_{e}, 0)$$\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The face Péclet number is $P_{e} = 5$.\n- The mass flux is positive, $F_{e}  0$.\n- The suppression function is defined for this case as $A(P_{e}) = (1 - 0.1 \\times 5)^{5}$. Note that the standard power-law scheme uses the absolute value of the Péclet number, i.e., $A(|P_e|)$. However, since $F_e  0$ and the diffusion conductance $D_e$ is inherently positive, $P_e = F_e/D_e  0$, so $|P_e| = P_e$.\n\nWe will now compute the two contributions to $a_{E}$ separately.\n\nFirst, we compute the value of the suppression function $A(P_{e})$:\n$$A(P_{e}) = A(5) = (1 - 0.1 \\times 5)^{5} = (1 - 0.5)^{5} = (0.5)^{5}$$\nExpressing $0.5$ as a fraction, we get:\n$$A(5) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{5} = \\frac{1^{5}}{2^{5}} = \\frac{1}{32}$$\n\nThe diffusive contribution to $a_{E}$ is therefore:\n$$\\text{Diffusive contribution} = D_{e} A(5) = D_{e} \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{D_{e}}{32}$$\n\nNext, we compute the convective contribution. We are given that the mass flux is positive, $F_{e}  0$. This implies that the term $-F_{e}$ is negative.\n$$\\text{Convective contribution} = \\max(-F_{e}, 0)$$\nSince $-F_{e}  0$, the maximum of this value and $0$ is $0$.\n$$\\text{Convective contribution} = 0$$\n\nNow, we combine the two contributions to find the total neighbor coefficient $a_{E}$:\n$$a_{E} = \\frac{D_{e}}{32} + 0 = \\frac{D_{e}}{32}$$\n\nInterpretation of the result:\nThe Péclet number $P_{e} = 5$ indicates a flow where convection is significantly stronger than diffusion (a common threshold is $|P_{e}|  2$). The power-law scheme responds to this by suppressing the diffusive flux. The suppression function $A(5) = 1/32$ reduces the diffusive coupling to only about $3.125\\%$ of what it would be in a pure diffusion scenario. The convective contribution to the neighbor coefficient $a_{E}$ is zero because the flow direction is positive ($F_{e}  0$), meaning the flow is from node $P$ towards node $E$. In an upwind scheme, the downstream node $E$ does not convectively influence the interface $e$. Thus, the coupling between nodes $P$ and $E$ is purely due to the heavily suppressed diffusion.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be the dimensionless neighbor coefficient $a_{E}/D_{e}$. We can compute this ratio using our expression for $a_{E}$:\n$$\\frac{a_{E}}{D_{e}} = \\frac{D_{e}/32}{D_{e}} = \\frac{1}{32}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}\n$$", "id": "3378097"}, {"introduction": "While the power-law scheme is a powerful engineering approximation, it is essential to understand the theoretical basis of its accuracy.

The scaling exponent $\\alpha$ is then found from a log-log plot of $\\|\\mathrm{TE}\\|_{\\mathrm{RMS}}$ versus $\\Delta x$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this entire procedure.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n# from scipy import ...\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the scaling exponent of the truncation error for a power-law\n    differencing scheme applied to the 1D convection-diffusion equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite specifications\n    L = 1.0\n    rho = 1.0\n    gamma = 1.0\n    N_values = [20, 40, 80, 160, 320]\n    P_star_values = [0.01, 2.0, 20.0]\n\n    # Manufactured solution and its derivatives\n    def phi_exact(x):\n        return np.sin(2 * np.pi * x)\n\n    # Function to compute the power-law modulation factor\n    def A_power_law(P):\n        return np.maximum(0.0, (1 - 0.1 * np.abs(P))**5)\n\n    def calculate_rms_truncation_error(N, P_star):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the RMS of the truncation error for a given grid size N\n        and target Peclet number P_star.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Grid and problem parameters\n        dx = L / N\n        u = (P_star * gamma) / (rho * dx)\n        D = gamma / dx\n        F = rho * u\n        P = F / D  # Should be equal to P_star\n\n        # Coefficients of the discrete equation (for u > 0)\n        A_p = A_power_law(P)\n        a_W = D * A_p + F\n        a_E = D * A_p\n        a_P = a_W + a_E  # Or F + 2 * D * A_p\n\n        # Cell centers and face positions\n        x_centers = (np.arange(N) + 0.5) * dx\n        x_faces_w = x_centers - 0.5 * dx\n        x_faces_e = x_centers + 0.5 * dx\n\n        # Exact solution at cell centers\n        phi_P_exact = phi_exact(x_centers)\n        \n        # Exact solution at neighbor centers, with boundary conditions\n        phi_W_exact = np.zeros(N)\n        phi_W_exact[1:] = phi_P_exact[:-1] # phi at a distance -dx\n        # phi_W_exact[0] is already 0, which is phi_exact(0)\n\n        phi_E_exact = np.zeros(N)\n        phi_E_exact[:-1] = phi_P_exact[1:] # phi at a distance +dx\n        # phi_E_exact[N-1] is already 0, which is phi_exact(L)\n\n        # Exact integrated source term S_u\n        # S_u = [2*pi*gamma*cos(2*pi*x) - rho*u*sin(2*pi*x)] from x_w to x_e\n        term_at_e = 2 * np.pi * gamma * np.cos(2 * np.pi * x_faces_e) - rho * u * np.sin(2 * np.pi * x_faces_e)\n        term_at_w = 2 * np.pi * gamma * np.cos(2 * np.pi * x_faces_w) - rho * u * np.sin(2 * np.pi * x_faces_w)\n        S_u_exact = term_at_e - term_at_w\n\n        # Truncation error for each cell\n        TE = a_W * phi_W_exact + a_E * phi_E_exact - a_P * phi_P_exact - S_u_exact\n        \n        # RMS norm of the truncation error\n        rms_TE = np.sqrt(np.mean(TE**2))\n        \n        return rms_TE\n\n    # --- Main logic ---\n    # Store the calculated scaling exponents\n    scaling_exponents = []\n\n    # Iterate over each Peclet number regime\n    for P_star in P_star_values:\n        rms_errors = []\n        log_dx_values = []\n        \n        # Iterate through grid refinements\n        for N in N_values:\n            dx = L / N\n            rms_error = calculate_rms_truncation_error(N, P_star)\n            \n            rms_errors.append(rms_error)\n            log_dx_values.append(np.log(dx))\n        \n        # Perform linear regression to find the scaling exponent alpha\n        # log(rms_error) = log(C) + alpha * log(dx)\n        log_rms_errors = np.log(rms_errors)\n        \n        # Use numpy.polyfit for linear regression (degree 1)\n        # It returns [slope, intercept]\n        alpha, _ = np.polyfit(log_dx_values, log_rms_errors, 1)        \n        scaling_exponents.append(alpha)\n    \n    return scaling_exponents\n\n# Run the simulation and format the output\nscaling_exponents = solve()\noutput_str = f\"[{','.join(f'{exp:.15f}' for exp in scaling_exponents)}]\"\n```", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{[1.999999998089456,1.813735165935969,1.000000000000000]}\n$$", "id": "3378103"}]}
