We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is based on dimensional analysis, grounded in the physical principles of turbulence as specified.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Large-Eddy Turnover Timescale, $\\tau_{flow}$**\n\nThe large-eddy turnover timescale, $\\tau_{flow}$, represents the characteristic time for the large, energy-containing eddies in the turbulent flow. According to the principles of the turbulent kinetic energy budget for statistically stationary, homogeneous turbulence, the rate of turbulent kinetic energy production is balanced by the viscous dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$. The quantity $\\epsilon$ also represents the rate at which energy is transferred from the large eddies through the inertial subrange to the small, dissipative eddies. The dynamics of these large eddies are therefore characterized by their turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass, $k$, and the rate of energy cascade, $\\epsilon$.\n\nWe seek to find a quantity with the dimension of time, $[\\text{T}]$, using only $k$ (with dimensions $[\\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-2}]$) and $\\epsilon$ (with dimensions $[\\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-3}]$). We can express $\\tau_{flow}$ as a product of powers of these quantities:\n$$\n\\tau_{flow} \\propto k^a \\epsilon^b\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are dimensionless exponents. Matching the dimensions on both sides:\n$$\n[\\text{T}]^1 [\\text{L}]^0 = ([\\text{L}]^2 [\\text{T}]^{-2})^a ([\\text{L}]^2 [\\text{T}]^{-3})^b = [\\text{L}]^{2a+2b} [\\text{T}]^{-2a-3b}\n$$\nThis yields a system of two linear equations for the exponents $a$ and $b$:\n1. For length $[\\text{L}]$: $2a + 2b = 0 \\implies a = -b$\n2. For time $[\\text{T}]$: $-2a - 3b = 1$\n\nSubstituting $a = -b$ into the second equation gives:\n$$\n-2(-b) - 3b = 1 \\implies 2b - 3b = 1 \\implies -b = 1 \\implies b = -1\n$$\nFrom $a = -b$, we find $a = 1$.\nThus, the large-eddy turnover timescale is directly proportional to $k$ and inversely proportional to $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\tau_{flow} = \\frac{k}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe constant of proportionality is taken to be unity by conventional definition.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Kolmogorov Timescale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$**\n\nThe Kolmogorov timescale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$, is the characteristic timescale of the smallest eddies in the flow, where kinetic energy is dissipated into heat by viscosity. According to Kolmogorov's first similarity hypothesis, the dynamics at these small scales are universally determined by the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the mean rate of energy dissipation per unit mass, $\\epsilon$.\n\nWe apply dimensional analysis to find a timescale using only $\\nu$ (with dimensions $[\\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-1}]$) and $\\epsilon$ (with dimensions $[\\text{L}^2 \\text{T}^{-3}]$).\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} \\propto \\nu^c \\epsilon^d\n$$\nwhere $c$ and $d$ are dimensionless exponents. Matching the dimensions:\n$$\n[\\text{T}]^1 [\\text{L}]^0 = ([\\text{L}]^2 [\\text{T}]^{-1})^c ([\\text{L}]^2 [\\text{T}]^{-3})^d = [\\text{L}]^{2c+2d} [\\text{T}]^{-c-3d}\n$$\nThis leads to the following system of equations:\n1. For length $[\\text{L}]$: $2c + 2d = 0 \\implies c = -d$\n2. For time $[\\text{T}]$: $-c - 3d = 1$\n\nSubstituting $c = -d$ into the second equation gives:\n$$\n-(-d) - 3d = 1 \\implies d - 3d = 1 \\implies -2d = 1 \\implies d = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nFrom $c = -d$, we find $c = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the Kolmogorov timescale is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nAgain, the constant of proportionality is conventionally unity.\n\n**3.
