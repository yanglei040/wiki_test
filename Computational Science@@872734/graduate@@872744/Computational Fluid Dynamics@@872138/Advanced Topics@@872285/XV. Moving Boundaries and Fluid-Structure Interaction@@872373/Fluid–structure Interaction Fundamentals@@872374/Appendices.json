The traction $T(t)$ is assumed to be sufficiently smooth, possessing at least three continuous time derivatives. This smoothness allows us to express $T^{n+1} \\equiv T(t^{n+1})$ using a Taylor series expansion around time $t^{n}$.\n\nThe Taylor expansion of $T(t)$ around $t = t^n$ is given by:\n$$T(t) = T(t^n) + \\dot{T}(t^n)(t - t^n) + \\frac{1}{2!}\\ddot{T}(t^n)(t - t^n)^2 + \\mathcal{O}((t-t^n)^3)$$\nWe evaluate this expansion at $t = t^{n+1} = t^n + \\Delta t$. Substituting $t = t^{n+1}$ into the series yields:\n$$T(t^{n+1}) = T(t^n) + \\dot{T}(t^n)(t^{n+1} - t^n) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{T}(t^n)(t^{n+1} - t^n)^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$$\nUsing the shorthand notation $T^k = T(t^k)$ and $\\dot{T}^n = \\dot{T}(t^n)$, and recognizing that $t^{n+1} - t^n = \\Delta t$, the expression becomes:\n$$T^{n+1} = T^n + \\dot{T}^n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{T}^n \\Delta t^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$$\nThe time-lag error $e^{n+1}$ is defined as the difference between the consistent traction $T^{n+1}$ and the lagged traction $T^n$:\n$$e^{n+1} = T^{n+1} - T^n$$\nSubstituting the Taylor expansion for $T^{n+1}$:\n$$e^{n+1} = \\left( T^n + \\dot{T}^n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{T}^n \\Delta t^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3) \\right) - T^n$$\n$$e^{n+1} = \\dot{T}^n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{T}^n \\Delta t^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$$\nThe leading-order asymptotic expression for the error is the term with the lowest power of $\\Delta t$. Therefore, the leading-order time-lag error is:\n$$e^{n+1} \\approx \\dot{T}^n \\Delta t$$\nThis shows that the standard staggered scheme, which uses $T^n$ as the load at time $t^{n+1}$, has an error that is first-order in time, $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$.\n\n**Part 2: Construction of a Second-Order Predictor**\n\nThe second task is to construct a linear multistep predictor for $T^{n+1}$ that is second-order accurate, meaning its truncation error is $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$. The predictor, denoted $\\widehat{T}^{n+1}$, is a linear combination of traction values at previous time steps: $T^n$, $T^{n-1}$, and $T^{n-2}$.\nLet the form of the predictor be:\n$$\\widehat{T}^{n+1} = aT^n + bT^{n-1} + cT^{n-2}$$\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constant coefficients to be determined.\n\nTo find these coefficients, we match the Taylor series expansion of $\\widehat{T}^{n+1}$ to the expansion of the exact value $T^{n+1}$ around the time $t^n$. The expansion for $T^{n+1}$ is:\n$$T^{n+1} = T^n + \\dot{T}^n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{T}^n \\Delta t^2 + \\frac{1}{6}\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)$$\nNext, we expand the terms $T^{n-1}$ and $T^{n-2}$ around $t^n$.\nFor $T^{n-1} = T(t^n - \\Delta t)$:\n$$T^{n-1} = T^n - \\dot{T}^n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{T}^n \\Delta t^2 - \\frac{1}{6}\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)$$\nFor $T^{n-2} = T(t^n - 2\\Delta t)$:\n$$T^{n-2} = T^n - \\dot{T}^n(2\\Delta t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{T}^n(2\\Delta t)^2 - \\frac{1}{6}\\dddot{T}^n(2\\Delta t)^3 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)$$\n$$T^{n-2} = T^n - 2\\dot{T}^n \\Delta t + 2\\ddot{T}^n \\Delta t^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)$$\nNow, substitute these expansions into the expression for $\\widehat{T}^{n+1}$:\n$$\\widehat{T}^{n+1} = aT^n + b\\left(T^n - \\dot{T}^n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{T}^n \\Delta t^2 - \\dots\\right) + c\\left(T^n - 2\\dot{T}^n \\Delta t + 2\\ddot{T}^n \\Delta t^2 - \\dots\\right)$$\nGroup the terms by derivatives of $T$ evaluated at $t^n$:\n$$\\widehat{T}^{n+1} = (a+b+c)T^n + (-b - 2c)\\dot{T}^n\\Delta t + \\left(\\frac{b}{2} + 2c\\right)\\ddot{T}^n\\Delta t^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$$\nFor $\\widehat{T}^{n+1}$ to be a second-order accurate approximation of $T^{n+1}$, the coefficients of the zeroth, first, and second-order terms in $\\Delta t$ in its expansion must match those in the expansion of $T^{n+1}$. This yields a system of three linear equations for $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n1. Coefficient of $T^n$: $a+b+c = 1$\n2. Coefficient of $\\dot{T}^n\\Delta t$: $-b-2c = 1$\n3. Coefficient of $\\ddot{T}^n\\Delta t^2$: $\\frac{b}{2} + 2c = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nWe solve this system. Adding equation (2) and equation (3):\n$$(-b - 2c) + \\left(\\frac{b}{2} + 2c\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$-\\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\implies b = -3$$\nSubstitute $b = -3$ into equation (2):\n$$-(-3) - 2c = 1 \\implies 3 - 2c = 1 \\implies 2c = 2 \\implies c = 1$$\nFinally, substitute $b = -3$ and $c = 1$ into equation (1):\n$$a + (-3) + 1 = 1 \\implies a - 2 = 1 \\implies a = 3$$\nThe coefficients are $a=3$, $b=-3$, and $c=1$. Therefore, the second-order predictor is:\n$$\\widehat{T}^{n+1} = 3T^n - 3T^{n-1} + T^{n-2}$$\nThe truncation error of this predictor is the difference $T^{n+1} - \\widehat{T}^{n+1}$. By including the $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$ terms in the expansions, the term proportional to $\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3$ in $\\widehat{T}^{n+1}$ is $(-\\frac{b}{6} - \\frac{4c}{3})\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3 = (-\\frac{-3}{6} - \\frac{4(1)}{3})\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3 = (\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{4}{3})\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3 = -\\frac{5}{6}\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3$. The corresponding term in the expansion for $T^{n+1}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3$. The error is $(\\frac{1}{6} - (-\\frac{5}{6}))\\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3 = \\dddot{T}^n \\Delta t^3$, confirming the truncation error is $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$ as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3T^{n} - 3T^{n-1} + T^{n-2}}$$", "id": "3319926"}]}
