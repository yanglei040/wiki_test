## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of intrusive [polynomial chaos expansions](@entry_id:162793), focusing on the principles of Galerkin projection and the construction of the resulting deterministic systems. Having mastered these core mechanisms, we now turn our attention to the application of this powerful framework. The true utility of a numerical method is revealed not in abstract formulation, but in its capacity to solve challenging problems across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines. This chapter will demonstrate how intrusive PCE is applied to a range of sophisticated, real-world models, illustrating its versatility and revealing deeper insights into the interplay between physical laws and [parametric uncertainty](@entry_id:264387).

Our exploration will not simply be a catalogue of examples. Instead, we will use these applications to explore recurring themes and advanced concepts that arise when moving from theory to practice. These include the handling of complex nonlinearities, the preservation of physical constraints such as conservation laws and positivity, the coupling of multiple physical domains, and the integration of intrusive PCE with advanced numerical methods. Through this journey, the reader will gain an appreciation for both the broad applicability of intrusive PCE and the critical modeling considerations required for its successful implementation.

### Core Applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) represents a primary domain for the application of intrusive PCE, owing to the prevalence of uncertain parameters in fluid properties, boundary conditions, and turbulence models. The intrusive formulation provides a pathway to propagate these uncertainties through the complex, [nonlinear dynamics](@entry_id:140844) of fluid flow.

#### Transport Phenomena and Conservation Laws

The foundational equations of fluid dynamics are built upon conservation principles. Intrusive PCE offers a systematic way to reformulate these laws in a stochastic context. Consider the canonical advection-diffusion equation, a model for the transport of a scalar quantity by a fluid. When the advection velocity and diffusivity are uncertain, the intrusive Galerkin projection results in a coupled system of deterministic [advection-diffusion equations](@entry_id:746317) for the PCE coefficients. This process reveals how uncertainties in physical parameters manifest as coupling terms between the chaos modes. The choice of the polynomial basis itself, guided by the Wiener-Askey scheme to match the probability distributions of the inputs, has a direct impact on the structure of these coupling terms. For instance, using a Hermite basis for Gaussian inputs versus a Laguerre basis for Gamma-distributed inputs will yield different Galerkin matrices, particularly when higher-order statistical moments like skewness are non-zero, thus altering the dynamics of the propagated mean and variance of the solution [@problem_id:3337857].

This principle extends to general [hyperbolic conservation laws](@entry_id:147752), which are central to CFD. When discretizing such laws using the [finite volume method](@entry_id:141374), the numerical flux at cell interfaces must be carefully defined. In an intrusive setting, the flux itself becomes a stochastic quantity. The Galerkin projection of the finite volume [semi-discretization](@entry_id:163562) leads to a system where the evolution of the cell-averaged chaos coefficients is governed by an intrusive numerical flux. This flux takes the form of a [matrix-vector product](@entry_id:151002) in chaos space, where the matrix, often termed the intrusive flux matrix, couples the different chaos modes across the cell interface. For a [linear advection equation](@entry_id:146245) with uncertain speed, this matrix is derived from the triple products of the chaos basis functions and the PCE coefficients of the advection speed [@problem_id:3337869].

A more profound challenge arises when the flux function's structure depends on the sign of an uncertain parameter, as is common in [upwind schemes](@entry_id:756378) for hyperbolic problems. An intrusive Riemann solver must be developed to handle this stochastic decision. For a [linear advection](@entry_id:636928) problem with an uncertain velocity $a(\xi)$ that may change sign, the upwind state is itself a random function, selected from the left or right states based on the sign of $a(\xi)$. The Galerkin projection of the resulting [upwind flux](@entry_id:143931) requires splitting the integral over the random space into regions where $a(\xi)$ is positive and negative. This creates a highly nonlinear, though well-defined, coupling in the chaos-projected system, which is essential for capturing the correct propagation of information in the stochastic domain [@problem_id:3337849].

#### Compressible Flows and Turbulence Modeling

The application of intrusive PCE to [compressible flows](@entry_id:747589), governed by the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, introduces further complexity due to strong nonlinearities in the flux terms. A powerful technique for analyzing such systems is to study the chaos-projected flux Jacobian. The eigenvalues of this large, block-structured matrix determine the characteristic wave speeds and stability of the intrusive system. Comparing the spectrum of the fully-projected Jacobian to that of simpler approximations, such as a Jacobian evaluated at the mean state or a Roe-type averaged Jacobian, provides critical insight into how uncertainty modifies the system's hyperbolic nature. Such an analysis reveals that simple mean-state linearizations can fail to capture the true range of wave speeds present in the [stochastic system](@entry_id:177599), a shortcoming that a full intrusive projection can rectify [@problem_id:3337840].

Turbulence modeling is another area where intrusive PCE provides unique insights. Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, such as the $k-\epsilon$ model, rely on numerous closure coefficients that are often empirically derived and subject to considerable uncertainty. Propagating this uncertainty is crucial for robust engineering design. When the intrusive Galerkin method is applied to the $k-\epsilon$ equations, the nonlinear production and destruction terms lead to a complex coupled system of ODEs for the chaos coefficients of $k$ and $\epsilon$. A critical challenge in this context is **intrusive [realizability](@entry_id:193701)**: ensuring that physically positive quantities like the turbulent kinetic energy $k$ and its dissipation rate $\epsilon$ remain non-negative for all realizations in the random space. For a first-order PCE representation $k(\xi) = \widehat{k}_0 + \widehat{k}_1 \psi_1(\xi)$, positivity for all $\xi$ imposes a constraint on the relative magnitude of the coefficients, such as $|\widehat{k}_1|/\widehat{k}_0 \le 1/\sqrt{3}$ for a Legendre basis on a [uniform distribution](@entry_id:261734). This illustrates a fundamental aspect of intrusive UQ: physical constraints on the solution must be translated into algebraic constraints on the chaos coefficients, which may not be automatically satisfied by the Galerkin projection [@problem_id:3337902].

Furthermore, intrusive PCE can be applied to the boundary conditions themselves. In wall-bounded turbulent flows, [wall functions](@entry_id:155079) are used to bridge the viscous sublayer. The classic [logarithmic law of the wall](@entry_id:262057), for instance, depends on the surface roughness length, which is often an uncertain parameter. By representing the uncertain roughness and the resulting [friction velocity](@entry_id:267882) as PCEs, one can formulate an intrusive [wall function](@entry_id:756610). The Galerkin projection of the log-law relationship yields a system of equations that determines the chaos coefficients of the [friction velocity](@entry_id:267882), thereby consistently coupling the uncertain wall condition to the flow interior. This allows for the direct computation of the statistics of near-wall quantities, such as the mean and variance of [wall shear stress](@entry_id:263108) or the dimensionless wall distance $y^+$ [@problem_id:3337875].

### Multiphysics and Interdisciplinary Connections

The intrusive Galerkin framework is not limited to single-physics problems but extends naturally to coupled, [multiphysics](@entry_id:164478) systems, making it a valuable tool across many engineering and scientific disciplines.

#### Fluid-Structure Interaction and Solid Mechanics

Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems involve a bidirectional coupling between a fluid flow and a deformable structure. Uncertainties can exist in the properties of the fluid, the structure, or both. Intrusive PCE can model this coupled system by expanding all uncertain fields—both fluid and solid—in a common polynomial basis. For example, in a [reduced-order model](@entry_id:634428) of a flexible plate interacting with a fluid, the structural modal displacement, stiffness, and damping can all be represented as PCEs. Applying the Galerkin projection to the governing [equation of motion](@entry_id:264286) results in a system of coupled second-order ODEs for the chaos coefficients of the displacement. This takes the form $\mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{u}} + \mathbf{D}\dot{\mathbf{u}} + \mathbf{K}\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}$, where $\mathbf{M}$, $\mathbf{D}$, and $\mathbf{K}$ are the chaos-projected mass, damping, and stiffness matrices. The fluid loading, even if simplified to a deterministic added mass, is incorporated into the block mass matrix $\mathbf{M}$. The stability of the entire stochastic FSI system can then be studied by analyzing the eigenvalues of the state-space matrix corresponding to this block system [@problem_id:3337852].

This approach connects directly to the broader field of the Stochastic Finite Element Method (SFEM) in solid mechanics. For instance, in analyzing the buckling of a structure with uncertain material properties (e.g., Young's modulus) and uncertain geometric imperfections, the [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) can be expanded in a PCE. The [equilibrium equations](@entry_id:172166), which are nonlinear in the displacement, are projected onto the chaos basis. Solving the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations—for example, with Newton's method in the space of chaos coefficients—yields the statistics of the structure's response, including the [critical buckling load](@entry_id:202664). This demonstrates the power of the intrusive framework to tackle geometrically nonlinear problems [@problem_id:3603259].

#### Heat and Mass Transfer

Conjugate heat transfer, involving thermal coupling between solid and fluid domains, is another natural application. Consider [heat conduction](@entry_id:143509) through a solid slab in contact with a fluid, where the thermal conductivity of the solid is uncertain. The temperature and heat flux at the interface become stochastic quantities. An intrusive Galerkin method can be used to enforce the continuity of temperature and heat flux at the interface in a stochastic sense. By projecting the interface [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) residual onto the chaos basis, one obtains a linear system for the PCE coefficients of the interface heat flux. This approach effectively creates a stochastic thermal coupling, allowing for the direct calculation of the mean and variance of the heat flux exchanged between the two domains [@problem_id:3337874].

The framework is also applicable to [multiphase flow](@entry_id:146480) problems, such as those described by diffuse-interface models. The Cahn-Hilliard equation, which models [phase separation](@entry_id:143918) in a binary fluid, depends on a mobility parameter and a surface tension-related coefficient, both of which can be uncertain. By linearizing the equation around a homogeneous state and performing an intrusive PCE in spatial Fourier space, one can derive a system of ODEs for the chaos coefficients of the Fourier amplitudes. Analyzing the eigenvalues of the system matrix reveals the growth or decay rates of perturbations, enabling a [stochastic stability](@entry_id:196796) analysis of the [phase separation](@entry_id:143918) process [@problem_id:3337864].

#### Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

In [magnetohydrodynamics](@entry_id:264274), the dynamics of a conducting fluid are coupled with Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. The [induction equation](@entry_id:750617), which governs the evolution of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, depends on the [fluid velocity](@entry_id:267320) $\mathbf{u}$ and the electrical resistivity $\eta$. When material properties like conductivity are uncertain, both $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{u}$ become [random fields](@entry_id:177952). The intrusive Galerkin projection of the [induction equation](@entry_id:750617) reveals a coupling between the chaos modes of the velocity and magnetic fields through the nonlinear convective term $\nabla \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B})$. A critical aspect of such problems is the preservation of fundamental physical constraints. The solenoidal ([divergence-free](@entry_id:190991)) conditions, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$ and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$, must hold for all realizations. In the intrusive framework, this implies that each chaos mode must be individually divergence-free, i.e., $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}_k = 0$ and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}_k = 0$. This ensures that the mathematical structure of the problem is preserved in the stochastic Galerkin formulation [@problem_id:3337882].

### Advanced Numerical and Analytical Topics

The successful application of intrusive PCE often involves navigating a number of advanced numerical and analytical challenges. These topics are at the frontier of research in intrusive UQ.

#### Integration with Advanced Discretizations and Geometries

Intrusive PCE can be coupled with a variety of sophisticated [spatial discretization](@entry_id:172158) schemes. When used with the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for viscous flow problems, the resulting semi-discrete system often exhibits a convenient block-Kronecker product structure. The global [system matrix](@entry_id:172230) can be expressed as $\mathbf{V} \otimes \mathbf{K}$, where $\mathbf{V}$ is a small matrix describing the coupling in chaos space (arising from the uncertain viscosity) and $\mathbf{K}$ is a large matrix representing the [spatial discretization](@entry_id:172158) of the deterministic part of the operator. This structure is highly advantageous, as the spectrum of the full system is simply the product of the spectra of $\mathbf{V}$ and $\mathbf{K}$, greatly simplifying stability analysis of [time-stepping schemes](@entry_id:755998) [@problem_id:3337844].

For problems involving moving or deforming domains, such as in FSI or cardiovascular modeling, the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method is often employed. When the domain geometry itself is uncertain, the ALE mapping becomes a [random field](@entry_id:268702). A key verification step is to ensure that the intrusive projection preserves the fundamental identities of the mapping, such as the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL). By projecting the GCL onto the chaos basis, one can verify that it holds for each chaos mode individually, confirming that the intrusive ALE formulation is consistent and will not introduce spurious sources or sinks of cell volume in the stochastic computation [@problem_id:3337876].

#### Aliasing, Sensitivity, and the Role of Model Error

A practical difficulty with intrusive Galerkin methods is the treatment of nonlinear terms. The projection of a product of two PCEs results in a polynomial of higher degree, which, when projected back onto the original truncated basis, can introduce **aliasing errors**. This occurs if the [quadrature rule](@entry_id:175061) used to compute the projection integrals is not sufficient to exactly integrate the resulting high-degree polynomial. One can isolate and study this effect by comparing a fully-resolved non-intrusive projection to a deliberately under-resolved intrusive calculation. For instance, in computing the [lift coefficient](@entry_id:272114) of an airfoil with uncertain angle of attack, the nonlinear aerodynamic model introduces products of chaos coefficients. Using a low-order quadrature for the intrusive projection introduces [aliasing](@entry_id:146322) that manifests as an error in the computed variance of the lift [@problem_id:3337878]. This highlights the need for [dealiasing](@entry_id:748248) techniques, such as using a higher-order quadrature rule (e.g., the $3/2$-rule), to ensure accuracy [@problem_id:3603259].

Despite these challenges, a major advantage of the PCE framework is the ability to perform efficient [global sensitivity analysis](@entry_id:171355). Once the PCE coefficients of a quantity of interest are computed, the Sobol' sensitivity indices can be calculated almost instantly through simple algebraic manipulation of the coefficients. This "intrusive" approach to sensitivity analysis is far more efficient than traditional post-processing methods that require many additional model evaluations. Comparing the indices computed directly from coefficients to those estimated via Monte Carlo methods demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of the PCE-based approach, while also showing how truncation of the PCE can affect the accuracy of the computed sensitivities [@problem_id:3337850].

Finally, the intrusive PCE framework finds a crucial application in the broader field of inverse problems and data assimilation. When a PCE model is used as a surrogate to accelerate a Bayesian inference task, the error of the surrogate itself introduces a form of [model discrepancy](@entry_id:198101). This error must be accounted for in the [likelihood function](@entry_id:141927) to avoid over-confident posterior estimates. An intrusive PCE, which minimizes the PDE residual in a weighted-average sense, often has a smaller projection error than a non-intrusive regression-based PCE of the same order. This smaller surrogate error translates into a smaller effective noise variance in the likelihood, ultimately leading to a more precise (i.e., lower variance) posterior distribution for the inferred parameters. This demonstrates a direct link between the accuracy of an intrusive surrogate and the quality of statistical inference [@problem_id:3411037].
