The physical quantities, their units, and the described model behavior are consistent with the literature on the SST model. The issue of false activation of blending functions in regions of low turbulence is a known practical and theoretical problem in CFD, making the premise valid. The problem is well-posed; it provides clear constraints for constructing a mathematical expression. The language is objective and formal. The givens are self-contained and consistent, assuming standard knowledge of the SST model formulation, which is appropriate for the specified professorial persona. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with a full, reasoned solution.\n\nThe solution begins by recalling the standard formulation of the blending function argument, $\\mathrm{arg}_1$, in the Menter SST model. This argument is designed to be dimensionless and blends different model behaviors. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{arg}_1 = \\min\\left[ \\max\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{\\beta^* \\omega y}, \\frac{500 \\nu}{y^2 \\omega}\\right), \\frac{4 \\sigma_{\\omega 2} k}{CD_{k\\omega} y^2} \\right]\n$$\nThe first term in the `min` function, $\\max(\\dots)$, is dominant in the near-wall region. The second term, involving the cross-diffusion measure $CD_{k\\omega}$, acts as a limiter away from the wall. The problem concerns the behavior of this second (limiter) term, which is identified as the \"third branch\" in the problem statement's context (counting the two terms inside the `max`).\n\nThe problem statement focuses on an asymptotic region characteristic of a separated laminar bubble, where mean shear $S$ is finite but turbulence is nearly non-existent. The conditions are: $k = \\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}$, $\\omega \\sim S  0$, $\\nabla k = \\mathbf{0}$, and $\\nabla \\omega = \\mathbf{0}$. Under these conditions, the cross-diffusion term, defined as $CD_{k\\omega} = \\max\\left( 2\\,\\sigma_{\\omega 2}\\,\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\,\\nabla k \\cdot \\nabla \\omega\\,,\\,10^{-20} \\right)$, simplifies significantly. Since the gradients are zero, the first argument to the `max` function is zero:\n$$\n2\\,\\sigma_{\\omega 2}\\,\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\,\\nabla k \\cdot \\nabla \\omega = 2\\,\\sigma_{\\omega 2}\\,\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\,\\mathbf{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{0} = 0\n$$\nThus, $CD_{k\\omega}$ activates its floor value:\n$$\nCD_{k\\omega} = 10^{-20} \\, [T^{-2}]\n$$\nThis is a very small number, intended to prevent division by zero in numerical codes. However, it leads to an issue in the limiter term of $\\mathrm{arg}_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{4 \\sigma_{\\omega 2} k}{CD_{k\\omega} y^2} = \\frac{4 \\sigma_{\\omega 2} \\varepsilon}{(10^{-20}) y^2}\n$$\nAlthough $k = \\varepsilon$ is small, the denominator is extremely small, causing the entire term to become very large for any finite $y$. This large value for the limiter term fails to limit $\\mathrm{arg}_1$, causing $\\mathrm{arg}_1$ itself to become large. Consequently, the blending function $F_1 = \\tanh(\\mathrm{arg}_1^4)$ approaches $1$. This is a \"false activation\" because $F_1=1$ engages the near-wall $k$-$\\omega$ model, which is inappropriate for a nearly laminar free-shear region.\n\nTo remedy this, we must construct a guarded measure for the denominator that does not become vanishingly small in this limit. The problem requires this modification to be based on the mean strain rate magnitude $S$ and a dimensionless guard constant $c_g$. Let us denote the guarded cross-diffusion term as $CD_{k\\omega}^{\\mathrm{guard}}$. This new term must be dimensionally consistent with $CD_{k\\omega}$, which has units of $[T^{-2}]$. The strain rate $S$ has units of $[T^{-1}]$, so $S^2$ has units of $[T^{-2}]$. Therefore, a term proportional to $S^2$ is dimensionally appropriate.\n\nLet us propose a modification using the `max` function, which is a common and effective way to introduce a lower bound or a switch-like behavior. We define the guarded measure as:\n$$\nCD_{k\\omega}^{\\mathrm{guard}} = \\max\\left( CD_{k\\omega}, (c_g S)^2 \\right)\n$$\nHere, $c_g$ is the positive dimensionless constant specified in the problem.\n\nLet's verify this proposed form against the problem's constraints:\n1.  **Based on $S$ and $c_g$**: The guard term $(c_g S)^2$ is based solely on $S$ and $c_g$.\n2.  **Prevents false activation**: In the asymptotic bubble, where $CD_{k\\omega} = 10^{-20}$ and $S$ is finite, the guarded measure becomes $CD_{k\\omega}^{\\mathrm{guard}} = \\max(10^{-20}, (c_g S)^2)$. For any physically relevant strain rate $S$, $(c_g S)^2$ will be substantially larger than $10^{-20}$. Thus, $CD_{k\\omega}^{\\mathrm{guard}} \\approx (c_g S)^2$, which is a finite, non-vanishing value. The limiter term becomes $\\frac{4 \\sigma_{\\omega 2} k}{ (c_g S)^2 y^2 }$, which correctly tends to zero as $k = \\varepsilon \\to 0$, preventing the pathological growth of $\\mathrm{arg}_1$.\n3.  **Recovers standard behavior**: The problem states that the standard behavior must be unchanged when $CD_{k\\omega}$ is sufficiently large compared to $S^2$. If $CD_{k\\omega} \\gg (c_g S)^2$, then $\\max\\left( CD_{k\\omega}, (c_g S)^2 \\right) = CD_{k\\omega}$. In this case, $CD_{k\\omega}^{\\mathrm{guard}} = CD_{k\\omega}$, and the original formulation is recovered exactly, as required.\n\nThe proposed modification satisfies all conditions. The final step is to construct the expression for the guarded argument, $\\mathrm{arg}_1^{\\mathrm{guard}}$, by substituting the new guarded measure into the standard formula. The problem specifies that the modification applies to the third branch, replacing $CD_{k\\omega}$ with the guarded measure.\n\nThe standard expression is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{arg}_1 = \\min\\left( \\text{near-wall term}, \\frac{4 \\sigma_{\\omega 2} k}{CD_{k\\omega} y^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe guarded expression, $\\mathrm{arg}_1^{\\mathrm{guard}}$, is obtained by replacing $CD_{k\\omega}$ with $CD_{k\\omega}^{\\mathrm{guard}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{arg}_1^{\\mathrm{guard}} = \\min\\left( \\max\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{\\beta^* \\omega y}, \\frac{500 \\nu}{y^2 \\omega}\\right), \\frac{4 \\sigma_{\\omega 2} k}{\\max\\left( CD_{k\\omega}, (c_g S)^2 \\right) y^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is the complete and final form that meets all the requirements of the problem.
