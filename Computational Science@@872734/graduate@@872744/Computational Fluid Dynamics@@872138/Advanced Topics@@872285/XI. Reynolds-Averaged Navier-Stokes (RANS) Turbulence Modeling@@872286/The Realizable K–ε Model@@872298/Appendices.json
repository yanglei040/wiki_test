It is based on the standard equations of the realizable $k$-$\\epsilon$ turbulence model within the context of homogeneous isotropic decaying turbulence, a canonical problem in the field. The premises are physically and mathematically sound, and the objectives are clearly defined.\n\nThe analysis begins with the two governing ordinary differential equations provided for the evolution of turbulent kinetic energy $k(t)$ and its dissipation rate $\\epsilon(t)$ in spatially homogeneous, isotropic, freely decaying turbulence:\n$$\n\\frac{dk}{dt} = -\\epsilon \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = -C_{\\epsilon 2} \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{k} \\quad (2)\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ is a positive model constant.\n\nWe seek a self-similar solution in the form of a power-law decay with time $t$. We assume:\n$$\nk(t) = A t^{-n}\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a positive constant representing the initial conditions and $n$ is the decay exponent to be determined.\n\nSubstituting this form for $k(t)$ into equation $(1)$, we can solve for $\\epsilon(t)$:\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = -\\frac{dk}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{dt}(A t^{-n}) = -A(-n)t^{-n-1} = n A t^{-(n+1)}\n$$\nFor a decaying solution, we must have $k > 0$ and $\\epsilon > 0$. Since $A$ represents an initial energy level and must be positive, this requires $n > 0$.\n\nNow we have expressions for $k(t)$ and $\\epsilon(t)$ in terms of the unknown exponent $n$. To find $n$, we must ensure these expressions also satisfy the second governing equation, equation $(2)$. First, we compute the time derivative of $\\epsilon(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(n A t^{-(n+1)}) = n A (-(n+1)) t^{-(n+1)-1} = -n(n+1)A t^{-(n+2)}\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the right-hand side of equation $(2)$ using our power-law forms for $k$ and $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n-C_{\\epsilon 2} \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{k} = -C_{\\epsilon 2} \\frac{(n A t^{-(n+1)})^2}{A t^{-n}} = -C_{\\epsilon 2} \\frac{n^2 A^2 t^{-2(n+1)}}{A t^{-n}} = -C_{\\epsilon 2} n^2 A t^{-2n-2+n} = -C_{\\epsilon 2} n^2 A t^{-(n+2)}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $d\\epsilon/dt$:\n$$\n-n(n+1)A t^{-(n+2)} = -C_{\\epsilon 2} n^2 A t^{-(n+2)}\n$$\nThis equation must hold for all $t$ in the self-similar regime. The time dependence $t^{-(n+2)}$ cancels, and we can divide by the non-zero common factor $-n A$ (since $n>0, A>0$):\n$$\nn+1 = C_{\\epsilon 2} n\n$$\nWe can now solve for the decay exponent $n$:\n$$\n1 = C_{\\epsilon 2} n - n\n$$\n$$\n1 = n(C_{\\epsilon 2} - 1)\n$$\nThis yields the expression for $n$ as a function of the model constant $C_{\\epsilon 2}$:\n$$\nn = \\frac{1}{C_{\\epsilon 2} - 1}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks to demonstrate consistency with the Kolmogorov equilibrium hypothesis, which states that the dimensionless dissipation $C_{\\epsilon} \\equiv \\epsilon L / k^{3/2}$ is constant in the inertial range, where $L$ is the integral length scale. Assuming a power-law growth for the integral scale, $L(t) \\sim t^{\\alpha}$, we test for consistency:\n$$\nC_{\\epsilon} \\sim \\frac{\\epsilon(t) L(t)}{(k(t))^{3/2}} \\sim \\frac{t^{-(n+1)} t^{\\alpha}}{(t^{-n})^{3/2}} = \\frac{t^{\\alpha - n - 1}}{t^{-3n/2}} = t^{\\alpha - n - 1 + \\frac{3n}{2}} = t^{\\alpha + \\frac{n}{2} - 1}\n$$\nFor $C_{\\epsilon}$ to be constant, the exponent must be zero:\n$$\n\\alpha + \\frac{n}{2} - 1 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{n}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting our result for $n$:\n$$\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{1}{2(C_{\\epsilon 2} - 1)}\n$$\nSince the problem specifies $C_{\\epsilon 2} = 1.9$, which is greater than $1$, a consistent finite positive exponent $\\alpha = 1 - 1/(2(0.9)) = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9$ exists. This confirms that the derived self-similar decay is compatible with the assumption of a constant dimensionless dissipation.\n\nQualitatively, the predicted decay exponent $n = 1/(1.9-1) = 1/0.9 = 10/9 \\approx 1.111$ can be compared to classical theoretical predictions based on the invariance of large-scale quantities. Saffman's theory predicts $n=6/5=1.2$, and Batchelor's theory predicts $n=10/7 \\approx 1.429$. The realizable $k$–$\\epsilon$ model predicts a decay exponent that is of the same order of magnitude but slightly smaller than these theoretical values, implying a marginally slower decay of turbulent kinetic energy.\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value of $n$ for the standard parameter value $C_{\\epsilon 2} = 1.9$:\n$$\nn = \\frac{1}{1.9 - 1} = \\frac{1}{0.9} = \\frac{10}{9} = 1.111\\overline{1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $n = 1.111$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.111}\n$$", "id": "3379028"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of a turbulence model near a solid wall is critical for its success in engineering applications.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive the asymptotic form of the turbulent dissipation rate, $\\epsilon(y)$, in the near-wall logarithmic region.
