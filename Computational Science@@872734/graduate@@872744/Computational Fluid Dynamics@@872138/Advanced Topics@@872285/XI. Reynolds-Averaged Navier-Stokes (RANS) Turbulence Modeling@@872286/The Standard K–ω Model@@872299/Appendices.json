Calculation of the numerical value of $Re_{t}$ using the provided data.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Turbulent Viscosity $\\mu_{t}$**\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the turbulent viscosity $\\mu_{t}$ in the context of the standard $k$–$\\omega$ model, starting from the Boussinesq approximation and using the physical interpretations of the relevant quantities. The turbulent viscosity is a function of the local fluid density $\\rho$, the turbulent kinetic energy $k$, and the specific dissipation rate $\\omega$. We can determine the functional form using dimensional analysis.\n\nThe dimensions of the involved quantities in terms of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$) are:\n-   Dynamic viscosity $\\mu_{t}$: $[\\mu_{t}] = M L^{-1} T^{-1}$\n-   Density $\\rho$: $[\\rho] = M L^{-3}$\n-   Turbulent kinetic energy $k$ (energy per unit mass): $[k] = \\frac{M L^2 T^{-2}}{M} = L^2 T^{-2}$\n-   Specific dissipation rate $\\omega$ (inverse time scale): $[\\omega] = T^{-1}$\n\nWe assume a power-law relationship of the form:\n$$ \\mu_{t} = C \\rho^{a} k^{b} \\omega^{c} $$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant. Equating the dimensions on both sides:\n$$ M^{1} L^{-1} T^{-1} = (M L^{-3})^{a} (L^{2} T^{-2})^{b} (T^{-1})^{c} $$\n$$ M^{1} L^{-1} T^{-1} = M^{a} L^{-3a+2b} T^{-2b-c} $$\n\nWe now equate the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n1.  For mass ($M$): $a = 1$\n2.  For length ($L$): $-1 = -3a + 2b$\n3.  For time ($T$): $-1 = -2b - c$\n\nSubstituting $a=1$ into the equation for length:\n$$ -1 = -3(1) + 2b \\implies 2b = 2 \\implies b = 1 $$\n\nSubstituting $b=1$ into the equation for time:\n$$ -1 = -2(1) - c \\implies c = -1 $$\n\nThe exponents are $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=-1$.

The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and relations provided for a unique solution. The question is objective and well-posed.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A step-by-step solution can be formulated.\n\n**Solution Formulation:**\n\nFirst, we determine the components of the mean strain-rate tensor, $S_{ij}$, for the given velocity field $\\boldsymbol{U} = (U_1, U_2, U_3) = (U(y), 0, 0)$. For an incompressible flow, the strain-rate tensor is defined as:\n$$S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)$$\nThe components are calculated as follows (using $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$):\n$S_{11} = \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial U(y)}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n$S_{22} = \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n$S_{33} = \\frac{\\partial U_3}{\\partial x_3} = \\frac{\\partial 0}{\\partial z} = 0$.\nThe only non-zero off-diagonal components arise from the shear term $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$:\n$S_{12} = S_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial U(y)}{\\partial y} + 0\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$.\nAll other components, $S_{13}$, $S_{31}$, $S_{23}$, $S_{32}$, are zero.\nGiven $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = 1000\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, the non-zero components are:\n$$S_{12} = S_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}(1000\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 500\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nNext, we compute the scalar strain-rate invariant $S \\equiv \\sqrt{2\\,S_{ij}S_{ij}}$. The term $S_{ij}S_{ij}$ (using Einstein summation) is the sum of the squares of all components of the tensor:\n$$S_{ij}S_{ij} = S_{12}^2 + S_{21}^2 = (500\\,\\text{s}^{-1})^2 + (500\\,\\text{s}^{-1})^2 = 2 \\times (500\\,\\text{s}^{-1})^2 = 500000\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$$\nThus, the invariant $S$ is:\n$$S = \\sqrt{2\\,S_{ij}S_{ij}} = \\sqrt{2 \\times (500000\\,\\text{s}^{-2})} = \\sqrt{1000000\\,\\text{s}^{-2}} = 1000\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThis value is equal to the magnitude of the mean shear, $\\left|\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\right|$.\n\nSecond, we compute the turbulent kinetic energy production, $P_k$. The exact definition is $P_k = -\\rho \\overline{u_i'u_j'} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}$. The Reynolds stress tensor $\\overline{u_i'u_j'}$ is symmetric, so its contraction with the anti-symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor is zero. Therefore, we can write $P_k$ in terms of the symmetric strain-rate tensor $S_{ij}$:\n$$P_k = -\\rho \\overline{u_i'u_j'} S_{ij}$$\nUsing the Boussinesq hypothesis for the Reynolds stress tensor:\n$$-\\rho \\overline{u_i'u_j'} = \\mu_t \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\rho k \\delta_{ij} = 2\\mu_t S_{ij} - \\frac{2}{3}\\rho k \\delta_{ij}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P_k$:\n$$P_k = \\left(2\\mu_t S_{ij} - \\frac{2}{3}\\rho k \\delta_{ij}\\right) S_{ij} = 2\\mu_t S_{ij}S_{ij} - \\frac{2}{3}\\rho k S_{ii}$$\nFor an incompressible flow, the trace of the strain-rate tensor $S_{ii} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{U} = 0$. This simplifies the production term to:\n$$P_k = 2\\mu_t S_{ij}S_{ij}$$\nWe can express this in terms of the invariant $S$: since $S^2 = 2\\,S_{ij}S_{ij}$, we have $P_k = \\mu_t S^2$.\nTo compute the numerical value of $P_k$, we first need the eddy viscosity $\\mu_t$. Using the given relation and data:\n$$\\mu_t = \\frac{\\rho k}{\\omega} = \\frac{(1.2\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})(0.50\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-2})}{5000\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.6}{5000}\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nNow we calculate $P_k$:\n$$P_k = \\mu_t S^2 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (1000\\,\\text{s}^{-1})^2 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 10^6\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-3} = 120\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-3}$$\n\nThird, we form the non-dimensional ratio $R \\equiv P_{k}/\\left(\\beta^{\\ast}\\rho k \\omega\\right)$. The denominator represents the destruction term of turbulent kinetic energy in the standard $k$–$\\omega$ model. We compute its value using the given constants and variables:\n$$D_k = \\beta^{\\ast}\\rho k \\omega = (0.09) \\times (1.2\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (0.50\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}) \\times (5000\\,\\text{s}^{-1})$$\n$$D_k = (0.09 \\times 1.2 \\times 0.5 \\times 5000)\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-3} = 270\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-3}$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{P_k}{D_k} = \\frac{120}{270} = \\frac{12}{27} = \\frac{4}{9}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $R = 0.4444...$.
