The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and definitions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The physical scenario and data are realistic. The problem passes all validation criteria and is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe governing equation for an incompressible, Newtonian fluid is the Navier-Stokes equation for momentum conservation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $t$ is time, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. For the specified steady flow, the time derivative term $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$ is zero.\n\nThe two terms on the left and right involving velocity represent inertial and viscous effects, respectively:\n- Inertial term: $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}$\n- Viscous term: $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n\nTo identify the control parameter governing the balance between these effects, we non-dimensionalize the equation. We use the mean axial speed $U$ as the characteristic velocity scale and the pipe diameter $D$ as the characteristic length scale. The magnitudes of the inertial and viscous terms can be scaled as:\n$$ |(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}| \\sim \\frac{U^2}{D} $$\n$$ |\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}| \\sim \\nu \\frac{U}{D^2} $$\nThe ratio of the magnitude of the inertial forces to the viscous forces defines the key dimensionless control parameter.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Inertial forces}}{\\text{Viscous forces}} \\sim \\frac{U^2/D}{\\nu U/D^2} = \\frac{UD}{\\nu} $$\nThis dimensionless group is the **Reynolds number**, denoted as $Re$. For pipe flow, it is specifically written with the diameter as the characteristic length, $Re_D$. This parameter governs the transition from a stable, orderly laminar flow regime to an unstable, chaotic turbulent regime.\n\nNext, we evaluate the value of the Reynolds number for the provided data:\n- $U = 2.8\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $D = 0.032\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\nu = 1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n\n$$ Re_D = \\frac{UD}{\\nu} = \\frac{(2.8\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(0.032\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{0.0896}{1.6 \\times 10^{-5}} = 5600 $$\n\nTo assess the likelihood of sustained turbulence, we compare this value to established critical Reynolds numbers for pipe flow under low ambient disturbance conditions. Canonical experiments show:\n- If $Re_D \\lesssim 2300$, the flow is laminar. Any disturbances introduced are damped by viscous forces.\n- If $Re_D \\gtrsim 4000$, the flow typically becomes fully turbulent. Inertial effects dominate, amplifying small disturbances into self-sustaining turbulent motion.\n- For $2300 \\lesssim Re_D \\lesssim 4000$, the flow is in a transitional state, where its character depends sensitively on the level of background disturbances.\n\nOur calculated value is $Re_D = 5600$. Since $5600 > 4000$, the Reynolds number is well above the upper critical value. Therefore, it is highly likely that the flow will exhibit sustained turbulence.\n\nNow, we consider the scenario where the fluid density doubles while the dynamic viscosity is held fixed.\n- Initial state: density $\\rho_1$, dynamic viscosity $\\mu_1$. The kinematic viscosity is $\\nu_1 = \\mu_1/\\rho_1$.\n- New state: density $\\rho_2 = 2\\rho_1$, dynamic viscosity $\\mu_2 = \\mu_1$.\nThe new kinematic viscosity $\\nu_2$ is:\n$$ \\nu_2 = \\frac{\\mu_2}{\\rho_2} = \\frac{\\mu_1}{2\\rho_1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\rho_1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\nu_1 $$\nThe new Reynolds number, $Re_{D,2}$, with $U$ and $D$ unchanged, is:\n$$ Re_{D,2} = \\frac{UD}{\\nu_2} = \\frac{UD}{\\frac{1}{2}\\nu_1} = 2 \\left(\\frac{UD}{\\nu_1}\\right) = 2 Re_{D,1} $$\nSubstituting the initial calculated value $Re_{D,1} = 5600$:\n$$ Re_{D,2} = 2 \\times 5600 = 11200 $$\nThe question requires this value to be reported rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $11200$. To express this unambiguously with four significant figures, we use scientific notation: $1.120 \\times 10^4$.\n\nFinally, we identify which of the other listed non-dimensional groups would change under the density modification. The key relationship is $Re = \\rho U D / \\mu$. Since $\\rho$ doubles and $\\mu$ is fixed, $Re$ doubles. Any other group that depends on $\\rho$ or on $Re$ will change.\n- **Reynolds number ($Re = \\rho U D / \\mu$):** Changes, as it is directly proportional to $\\rho$.\n- **Mach number ($M = U/c$):** The speed of sound $c$ depends on fluid properties, typically as $c = \\sqrt{K/\\rho}$ where $K$ is the bulk modulus. As $\\rho$ changes, $c$ changes, and therefore $M$ changes.\n- **Froude number ($Fr = U/\\sqrt{gD}$):** Does not depend on fluid properties such as $\\rho$ or $\\mu$. It would not change.\n- **Strouhal number ($St = fD/U$):** Used for unsteady flows. The characteristic frequency of instabilities, $f$, in a flow is a function of the flow dynamics, which are governed by $Re$. Since $Re$ changes, any characteristic frequency $f$ is expected to change. Thus, $St$ would change.\n- **Weber number ($We = \\rho U^2 D / \\sigma$):** Where $\\sigma$ is the surface tension coefficient. It is directly proportional to $\\rho$ and would therefore change.\n- **Euler number ($Eu = \\Delta p / (\\rho U^2)$):** Represents a dimensionless pressure. The pressure drop $\\Delta p$ in a pipe is related to the friction factor $f_D$ via the Darcy-Weisbach equation: $\\Delta p \\propto f_D \\rho U^2$. The friction factor $f_D$ is a function of $Re$ (for turbulent flow in a smooth pipe, e.g., $f_D \\approx 0.316 Re_D^{-1/4}$ from the Blasius correlation). Since $Re$ changes, $f_D$ changes, which means $\\Delta p$ does not scale linearly with $\\rho$. Consequently, the ratio $Eu$ changes.\n\nIn summary, of the groups listed, all except the Froude number would change.\n\nThe final answer requested is the new value of the inertial-viscous control parameter (the Reynolds number), rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.120 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "3322686"}, {"introduction": "Once turbulence is established, it acts as an engine that continuously extracts energy from the mean flow and dissipates it into heat at the smallest scales.

All provided data are physically consistent and sufficient for a complete solution.\n\nThe theoretical framework begins with the concept of the turbulent energy cascade. In stationary, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, energy is injected at large scales, cascades through a range of intermediate scales (the inertial subrange) without significant loss, and is finally dissipated into heat by viscous forces at the smallest scales. The rate of this energy dissipation per unit mass, denoted by $\\varepsilon$, is a central parameter and has units of $\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-3}}$.\n\nThe smallest length scale of the velocity field, the Kolmogorov scale $\\eta$, is determined by the balance between inertial and viscous effects.
