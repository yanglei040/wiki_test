The governing equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial t} + U_{j}\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x_{j}} \\;=\\; P - \\epsilon \\;+\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{j}}\\!\\left[\\left(\\nu + \\frac{\\nu_{t}}{\\sigma_{k}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x_{j}}\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial t} + U_{j}\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial x_{j}} \\;=\\; C_{\\epsilon 1}\\,\\frac{\\epsilon}{k}\\,P \\;-\\; C_{\\epsilon 2}\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k} \\;+\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{j}}\\!\\left[\\left(\\nu + \\frac{\\nu_{t}}{\\sigma_{\\epsilon}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial x_{j}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe simplifying assumptions and their consequences are as follows:\n1.  **Homogeneous Turbulence**: In homogeneous turbulence, all spatially-averaged statistical quantities are independent of position. Therefore, all spatial derivatives of mean quantities like $k$ and $\\epsilon$ must be zero.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x_{j}} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial x_{j}} = 0\n    $$\n    This implies that the convective transport terms, $U_{j}\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x_{j}}$ and $U_{j}\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial x_{j}}$, are zero. It also implies that the diffusive transport terms, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{j}}\\!\\left[\\dots\\right]$, are zero. As a result, $k$ and $\\epsilon$ are functions of time $t$ only, i.e., $k(t)$ and $\\epsilon(t)$. The partial time derivatives become ordinary time derivatives, $\\frac{d}{dt}$.\n\n2.  **No Mean Shear**: The production of turbulent kinetic energy, $P$, arises from the interaction of Reynolds stresses with mean velocity gradients. In the absence of mean shear, the mean velocity gradients are zero, and thus the production term is zero.\n    $$\n    P = 0\n    $$\n\n3.  **Freely Decaying Turbulence**: This condition means there is no external forcing or energy input into the system, which is consistent with $P=0$ and the absence of any other source terms.\n\nApplying these simplifications to the general transport equations reduces the system of partial differential equations to a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dk}{dt} = - \\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = - C_{\\epsilon 2}\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k}\n$$\nThese equations describe the temporal decay of $k$ and $\\epsilon$ in homogeneous, unforced turbulence.\n\nTo solve this system, we seek a relationship between $\\epsilon$ and $k$. We can divide the second ODE by the first, provided $\\frac{dk}{dt} = -\\epsilon \\neq 0$, which is true for decaying turbulence where $k > 0$ and $\\epsilon > 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dk} = \\frac{d\\epsilon/dt}{dk/dt} = \\frac{- C_{\\epsilon 2}\\,\\epsilon^{2}/k}{- \\epsilon} = C_{\\epsilon 2}\\,\\frac{\\epsilon}{k}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ODE relating $\\epsilon$ to $k$. We can rearrange and integrate:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d\\epsilon}{\\epsilon} = \\int C_{\\epsilon 2} \\frac{dk}{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(\\epsilon) = C_{\\epsilon 2} \\ln(k) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration.

This power-law relationship between $\\epsilon$ and $k$ is characteristic of a self-similar decay state. The primary assumption required to proceed is that the turbulence has evolved for a sufficient time to reach this asymptotic, self-similar state, which is characteristic of high-Reynolds-number turbulent decay.
