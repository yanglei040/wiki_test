In component form, its non-zero elements are:\n$$\nS_{11} = S\n$$\n$$\nS_{22} = -S\n$$\n$$\nS_{33} = 0\n$$\nAll off-diagonal components $S_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ are zero.\n\nWe can now compute the deviatoric normal stresses, $R_{11}'$, $R_{22}'$, and $R_{33}'$, by substituting the components of $S_{ij}$ into the model equation.\n\nFor the first component ($i=1, j=1$):\n$$\nR_{11}' = -2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S_{11} = -2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S\n$$\n\nFor the second component ($i=2, j=2$):\n$$\nR_{22}' = -2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S_{22} = -2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,(-S) = 2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S\n$$\n\nFor the third component ($i=3, j=3$):\n$$\nR_{33}' = -2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S_{33} = -2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,(0) = 0\n$$\n\nWith these derived stresses, we can compute the scalar ratio $r$:\n$$\nr \\equiv \\frac{R_{11}' - R_{22}'}{R_{22}' - R_{33}'}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the deviatoric stresses into the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator: $R_{11}' - R_{22}' = (-2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S) - (2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S) = -4\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S$.\nDenominator: $R_{22}' - R_{33}' = (2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S) - 0 = 2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S$.\n\nThe ratio $r$ is therefore:\n$$\nr = \\frac{-4\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S}{2\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S}\n$$\nSince the problem specifies $S > 0$ and $\\nu_t > 0$, the term $\\nu_t S$ is non-zero and can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator.\n$$\nr = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n$$\n\n### Explanation of Model Failure\n\nThe failure of the linear eddy-viscosity closure to reproduce the results from Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) or from physical experiments for homogeneous plane strain stems from its fundamentally flawed representation of turbulence physics, specifically the roles of production and pressure-strain correlation.\n\nThe evolution of the Reynolds stress tensor $R_{ij}$ is governed by its transport equation:\n$$\n\\frac{D R_{ij}}{Dt} = P_{ij} + \\Pi_{ij} - \\epsilon_{ij} + \\text{Transport terms}\n$$\nFor homogeneous turbulence, the transport terms are zero. We focus on the production tensor, $P_{ij} = -(R_{ik}S_{jk} + R_{jk}S_{ik})$, and the pressure-strain tensor, $\\Pi_{ij} = \\overline{p'(\\partial_j u_i' + \\partial_i u_j')}$.\n\n$1$. **Production of Anisotropy**: The production term, $P_{ij}$, describes the rate at which the mean flow strain generates or destroys Reynolds stresses. For plane strain, the production of the normal stress components are $P_{11} = -2R_{11}S$, $P_{22} = 2R_{22}S$, and $P_{33} = 0$. This shows that the mean strain directly produces anisotropy in the normal stresses.\n\n$2$. **Pressure-Strain Redistribution**: The pressure-strain term, $\\Pi_{ij}$, does not change the total turbulent kinetic energy (since its trace $\\Pi_{kk}=0$ for incompressible flow) but redistributes it among the normal stress components, acting to drive the turbulence towards a more isotropic state. Crucially, the pressure field $p'$ is coupled to both the turbulent velocity fluctuations and the mean strain field. This coupling allows the pressure-strain term to transfer energy from components receiving production to those that are not.\n\n$3$. **The Fundamental Flaw**: In the case of plane strain, the production rate for the third normal stress component, $P_{33}$, is exactly zero because $S_{33}=0$. However, physics dictates (and RDT correctly models) that the pressure-strain term $\\Pi_{33}$ is non-zero. It channels energy—primarily from the compressive component $R_{22}$ which experiences the largest production—into the other two components, including $R_{33}$. Consequently, even though there is no direct production of $R_{33}$, it evolves due to this redistribution mechanism. This results in a non-zero deviatoric stress $R_{33}' \\neq 0$. Direct numerical simulations and experiments confirm that for plane strain, $R_{33}$ does not remain equal to the mean normal stress $\\frac{2}{3}k$.\n\nThe linear eddy-viscosity model, by its very definition $R_{ij}' = -2\\nu_t S_{ij}$, forces a direct, linear, and coaxial alignment between the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor $R_{ij}'$ and the mean strain tensor $S_{ij}$. Since $S_{33}=0$ in plane strain, the model unconditionally predicts $R_{33}' = 0$. This prediction is a direct contradiction of the physical role of the pressure-strain mechanism. By forcing $R_{33}'$ to be zero, the model incorrectly represents the state of anisotropy and consequently yields incorrect ratios of the normal stresses, such as the value of $r$. RDT and more advanced nonlinear or Reynolds-stress transport models can capture this redistribution effect and predict physically realistic, non-zero values for $R_{33}'$, leading to a value of $r$ closer to $-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2}\n$$", "id": "3340456"}, {"introduction": "We now extend our analysis to flows affected by body forces, specifically system rotation, a crucial element in turbomachinery and geophysical applications.

I will now proceed with a full solution.\n\n***\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the LEV Model Prediction\n\nThe Boussinesq linear eddy-viscosity hypothesis relates the Reynolds stress tensor $R_{ij}$ to the mean strain-rate tensor $S_{ij}$:\n$$\nR_{ij} = \\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{ij} - 2 \\nu_t S_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the turbulent kinetic energy, $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\\nu_t$ is the scalar eddy viscosity. The mean strain-rate tensor $S_{ij}$ is defined as:\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a homogeneous plane shear flow with a mean velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{U} = (U_1, U_2, U_3) = (S y, 0, 0)$, where $S$ is the constant mean shear rate and the coordinates are $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$.\n\nWe first compute the components of the mean strain-rate tensor $S_{ij}$. The only non-zero gradient of the mean velocity is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial (S y)}{\\partial y} = S\n$$\nAll other gradients $\\partial U_i / \\partial x_j$ are zero.\nThe components of $S_{ij}$ are therefore:\n$$\nS_{11} = \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_1} = 0\n$$\n$$\nS_{22} = \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nS_{33} = \\frac{\\partial U_3}{\\partial x_3} = 0\n$$\nThe off-diagonal component $S_{12}$ is:\n$$\nS_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (S + 0) = \\frac{S}{2}\n$$\nBy symmetry, $S_{21} = S_{12} = \\frac{S}{2}$. All other off-diagonal components ($S_{13}, S_{23}$) are zero.\n\nNow, we use the Boussinesq hypothesis to find the predicted Reynolds shear stress, $R_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}}$.\n$$\nR_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}} = \\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{12} - 2 \\nu_t S_{12}\n$$\nSince $i=1$ and $j=2$, the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{12}$ is $0$. Substituting the value of $S_{12}$:\n$$\nR_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}} = 0 - 2 \\nu_t \\left( \\frac{S}{2} \\right) = - \\nu_t S\n$$\nThe eddy viscosity $\\nu_t$ is assumed to be a scalar property of the turbulence state, typically modeled as a function of $k$ and its dissipation rate $\\varepsilon$ (e.g., $\\nu_t = C_\\mu k^2/\\varepsilon$). In this standard formulation, $\\nu_t$ has no explicit dependence on the system rotation rate $\\Omega$. Therefore, the linear eddy-viscosity model prediction for the Reynolds shear stress, $R_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}} = - \\nu_t S$, is indeed independent of $\\Omega$ and the rotation number $Ro$.\n\n### Part 2: Deduction of the True Reynolds Shear Stress Scaling\n\nThe linear eddy-viscosity model's insensitivity to rotation is a known flaw. Physically, the dynamics of turbulence in a rotating frame are affected by the Coriolis force. Although the Coriolis force does no net work on the flow, it redistributes energy among the Reynolds stress components, altering the turbulence structure.\n\nThe problem states that the governing equations are invariant under superposed rigid-body rotation. This implies that the turbulence dynamics should not depend on the mean shear $S$ and the system rotation $2\\Omega$ independently, but rather on a combination that represents the \"effective\" shear in the rotating frame. This effective shear is related to the absolute vorticity of the mean flow.\n\nThe vorticity of the mean flow is $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{U}$. For $\\boldsymbol{U} = (Sy, 0, 0)$, the only non-zero component is:\n$$\n\\omega_3 = \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial y} = 0 - S = -S\n$$\nSo, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (0, 0, -S)$. The system rotation provides a background vorticity of $2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = (0, 0, 2\\Omega)$.\nThe absolute vorticity vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{\\text{abs}} = \\boldsymbol{\\omega} + 2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = (0, 0, 2\\Omega - S)$.\n\nThe problem posits that for this flow configuration, the relevant physical quantity controlling the linear response of turbulence is the spanwise component of absolute vorticity, which is given as $\\omega_a = S - 2\\Omega$. This quantity represents the net vorticity that can tilt and stretch vortex lines to sustain turbulence production against the stabilizing/destabilizing effect of rotation.\n\nFollowing this physical argument, the Reynolds shear stress $R_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}}$ should, to leading order, be proportional to this effective shear rate $\\omega_a$ rather than the mean shear rate $S$ alone. We can write this as:\n$$\nR_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} \\propto \\omega_a \\implies R_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} = C (S - 2\\Omega)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant. To determine $C$, we use the condition that this expression must match the well-established result for the non-rotating case, i.e., in the limit $\\Omega \\rightarrow 0$. In the non-rotating limit, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Omega \\to 0} R_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} = C \\cdot S\n$$\nThe correct non-rotating limit is given by the standard Boussinesq model (which is accurate for simple shear), $R_{12} = - \\nu_t S$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\nC \\cdot S = - \\nu_t S \\implies C = -\\nu_t\n$$\nThis assumes that $\\nu_t$ itself is evaluated at the same turbulence state (fixed $k, \\varepsilon$) for the sake of comparing the functional form of the stress-strain relationship. Substituting $C = -\\nu_t$ back into the proposed form yields:\n$$\nR_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} = -\\nu_t (S - 2\\Omega)\n$$\nThis form correctly captures the suppression of shear stress for stable rotation ($S - 2\\Omega  S$) and correctly reduces to the non-rotating case.\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of the Overprediction Factor\n\nThe overprediction factor $F(Ro)$ of the linear eddy-viscosity model for stable rotation is defined as the ratio of the LEV model's prediction to the true physical shear stress:\n$$\nF(Ro) = \\frac{R_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}}}{R_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}}}\n$$\nUsing the results from Part 1 and Part 2:\n$$\nR_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}} = - \\nu_t S\n$$\n$$\nR_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} = - \\nu_t (S - 2\\Omega)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F(Ro)$:\n$$\nF(Ro) = \\frac{- \\nu_t S}{- \\nu_t (S - 2\\Omega)} = \\frac{S}{S - 2\\Omega}\n$$\nTo express this solely in terms of the rotation number $Ro = 2\\Omega/S$, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $S$:\n$$\nF(Ro) = \\frac{S/S}{(S - 2\\Omega)/S} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{2\\Omega}{S}}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $Ro$:\n$$\nF(Ro) = \\frac{1}{1 - Ro}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the overprediction factor as a function of the rotation number. For stable rotation ($Ro0$), the denominator $1-Ro$ is less than $1$, so $F(Ro)  1$, confirming that the LEV model overpredicts the magnitude of the Reynolds shear stress.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 - Ro}}\n$$", "id": "3340460"}, {"introduction": "To bridge the gap between idealized theory and practical application, we turn to the complex turbulence structure near a three-wall corner.

The deficit is defined as the Euclidean distance between the predicted and target anisotropy eigenvalue vectors:\n$$\nD(s,r,f) = \\left\\|\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}(s,r,f) - \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{1C}}\\right\\|_2\n$$\nThe target eigenvalue vector, corresponding to the one-component limit, is given as a constant vector:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{1C}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3},\\,-\\frac{1}{3},\\,-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n$$\nThe calculation of the predicted eigenvalue vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}(s,r,f)$, proceeds in a sequence of steps derived from the problem's definitions for a given set of parameters $(s, r, f)$.\n\nFirst, the Boussinesq linear eddy-viscosity closure relates the anisotropy tensor $\\mathbf{b}$ to the mean strain-rate tensor $\\mathbf{S}$ via the parameter $\\alpha = \\nu_t/k$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b} = -\\alpha\\,\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{b}$, which constitute the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}$, are thus directly proportional to the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{S}$. The mean strain-rate tensor for the specified corner flow is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathrm{diag}\\left(s,\\; r\\,s,\\; -(1+r)\\,s\\right)\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{S}$ are its diagonal components. Consequently, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{b}$ are:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}} = \\left(-\\alpha s,\\; -\\alpha r s,\\; \\alpha (1+r)s\\right)\n$$\nThe value of $\\alpha$ is determined by the realizability constraint and the parameter $f$. The realizability constraint, which ensures the Reynolds stress tensor is positive-definite, imposes an upper bound on $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\max}(s,r) \\equiv \\frac{1}{3s\\,\\max(1,r)}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\alpha$ is to be taken as a fraction $f \\in (0,1)$ of this maximum value:\n$$\n\\alpha = f\\,\\alpha_{\\max}(s,r) = \\frac{f}{3s\\,\\max(1,r)}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\alpha$ into the equation for $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}$ yields the predicted eigenvalues as a direct function of the input parameters $(s,r,f)$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}(s,r,f) = \\left( -\\frac{f s}{3s\\,\\max(1,r)}, \\; -\\frac{f r s}{3s\\,\\max(1,r)}, \\; \\frac{f (1+r)s}{3s\\,\\max(1,r)} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying by canceling the strain-rate magnitude $s$ reveals a key property of the model:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}(r,f) = \\frac{f}{3\\,\\max(1,r)}\\left(-1, \\; -r, \\; 1+r\\right)\n$$\nThis shows that the predicted anisotropy state $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}$ is independent of the overall strain rate magnitude $s$, a property explicitly tested by comparing test cases $1$ and $5$.\n\nThe anisotropy deficit $D$ can now be computed by substituting the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{1C}}$ into the Euclidean distance formula:\n$$\nD(s,r,f) = \\sqrt{ \\left(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{LEV},1} - \\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{LEV},2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{LEV},3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 }\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{LEV},i}$ are the components of the $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}$ vector. The computational procedure for each test case $(s,r,f)$ is as follows:\n1.  Calculate $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{LEV}}$ using the simplified formula dependent only on $r$ and $f$.\n2.  Define the constant vector $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{1C}}$.\n3.  Compute the element-wise difference between the two vectors.\n4.  Square each element of the difference vector, sum the squares, and take the square root of the sum.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each provided test case to generate the final list of deficit values.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the anisotropy deficit for a series of test cases based on\n    a linear eddy-viscosity model for turbulence in a corner flow.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (s, r, f)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.95),    # Case 1\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.999),   # Case 2\n        (1.0, 0.75, 0.95),   # Case 3\n        (1.0, 1.25, 0.95),   # Case 4\n        (0.5, 1.0, 0.95),    # Case 5\n    ]\n    \n    # The target one-component eigenvalue vector is constant.\n    lambda_1c = np.array([2.0/3.0, -1.0/3.0, -1.0/3.0])\n\n    results = []\n    for s, r, f in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Calculate the maximum allowed eddy-viscosity ratio, alpha_max.\n        # This is derived from the realizability constraint.\n        # s  0, r  0 are given.\n        alpha_max = 1.0 / (3.0 * s * max(1.0, r))\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate the model's eddy-viscosity ratio, alpha, as a\n        # fraction f of the maximum.\n        alpha = f * alpha_max\n\n        # Step 3: Calculate the eigenvalues of the anisotropy tensor predicted\n        # by the linear eddy-viscosity (LEV) model.\n        # lambda_LEV = (-alpha*s, -alpha*r*s, alpha*(1+r)*s)\n        lambda_lev_1 = -alpha * s\n        lambda_lev_2 = -alpha * r * s\n        lambda_lev_3 = alpha * (1.0 + r) * s\n        lambda_lev = np.array([lambda_lev_1, lambda_lev_2, lambda_lev_3])\n\n        # Step 4: Quantify the anisotropy deficit as the Euclidean distance\n        # between the LEV prediction and the target one-component state.\n        deficit = np.linalg.norm(lambda_lev - lambda_1c)\n        results.append(deficit)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3340475"}]}
