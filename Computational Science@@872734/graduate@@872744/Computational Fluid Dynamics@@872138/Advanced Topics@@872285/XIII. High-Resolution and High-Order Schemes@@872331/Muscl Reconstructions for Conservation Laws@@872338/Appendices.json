A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe goal is to compute the limited slopes $\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}}$ and $\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}}$, and the corresponding interface values $u_{i-1/2}^R$ and $u_{i+1/2}^L$ for each limiter, given the cell-average data $\\bar u_{i-1} = 1$, $\\bar u_i = 2$, and $\\bar u_{i+1} = 3$.\n\nFirst, we compute the one-sided divided differences, $s_L$ and $s_R$. The mesh spacing $\\Delta x$ is a positive constant.\n$$\ns_L = \\frac{\\bar u_i - \\bar u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{2 - 1}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n$$\ns_R = \\frac{\\bar u_{i+1} - \\bar u_i}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{3 - 2}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nWe observe that the flow-field data is linear across the three cells, resulting in $s_L = s_R$.\n\nNext, we compute the limited slope using the minmod limiter, $\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}}$. The inputs to the limiter are $a = s_L = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}$ and $b = s_R = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}$. Since $\\Delta x  0$, we have $s_L  0$ and $s_R  0$, so their product $s_L s_R = \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2}  0$.\nApplying the definition of the minmod limiter:\n$$\n\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}} = \\operatorname{minmod}(s_L, s_R) = \\min(|s_L|, |s_R|)\\,\\operatorname{sign}(s_L)\n$$\nSince $s_L = s_R = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}} = \\min\\left(\\left|\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right|, \\left|\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right|\\right)\\,\\operatorname{sign}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the limited slope using the van Leer limiter, $\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}}$. The inputs $s_L$ and $s_R$ are the same. Since $s_L s_R  0$, we use the corresponding case for the van Leer limiter definition:\n$$\n\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{VL}}(s_L, s_R) = \\frac{2 s_L s_R}{s_L + s_R}\n$$\nSubstituting $s_L = s_R = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}} = \\frac{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{(\\Delta x)^2}}{\\frac{2}{\\Delta x}} = \\frac{2}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nAs expected for linear data where $s_L = s_R$, both limiters return the same slope: $\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}} = \\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}$. This indicates that for this particular linear data, the reconstruction is not limited and retains its second-order accuracy.\n\nWith the limited slopes determined, we can find the interface values.\nFor the minmod limiter, the limited slope is $\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}$. The reconstructed interface values from cell $i$ are:\n$$\nu_{i-1/2}^{R,\\mathrm{mm}} = \\bar u_i - \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x\\, \\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right) = 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n$$\nu_{i+1/2}^{L,\\mathrm{mm}} = \\bar u_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x\\, \\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}} = 2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right) = 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}\n$$\n\nFor the van Leer limiter, the limited slope is $\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}$. The reconstructed interface values from cell $i$ are:\n$$\nu_{i-1/2}^{R,\\mathrm{vl}} = \\bar u_i - \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x\\, \\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right) = 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n$$\nu_{i+1/2}^{L,\\mathrm{vl}} = \\bar u_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x\\, \\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}} = 2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\right) = 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}\n$$\n\nThe results for both limiters coincide. This is because the input data profile is perfectly linear, and both limiters are designed to be second-order accurate (i.e., not apply any limiting) for such profiles.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(\\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{mm}}, \\sigma_i^{\\mathrm{vl}}, u_{i-1/2}^{R,\\mathrm{mm}}, u_{i+1/2}^{L,\\mathrm{mm}}, u_{i-1/2}^{R,\\mathrm{vl}}, u_{i+1/2}^{L,\\mathrm{vl}})$.\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x}, \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}, \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}  \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}  \\frac{3}{2}  \\frac{5}{2}  \\frac{3}{2}  \\frac{5}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3347626"}, {"introduction": "Numerical methods for physical systems must obey fundamental physical principles.

Finite-Volume Discretization\n\nThe scalar conservation law is $u_t + f(u)_x = 0$, with flux $f(u)=au$. We discretize this equation on a uniform grid of $N$ cells, each of width $\\Delta x = 1/N$. The cell centers are $x_i = (i+1/2)\\Delta x$ for $i=0, ..., N-1$. The cell average in cell $i$ is $U_i(t)$. The semi-discrete finite-volume formulation for cell $i$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dU_i}{dt} = L(U)_i = -\\frac{1}{\\Delta x} (F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2})\n$$\nwhere $L(U)_i$ is the spatial discretization operator and $F_{i\\pm 1/2}$ are the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces $x_{i\\pm 1/2}$.\n\n### 2. MUSCL Reconstruction and Numerical Flux\n\nTo achieve second-order spatial accuracy, we use MUSCL (Monotonic Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws) to reconstruct a piecewise linear representation of the solution within each cell. The value of the solution at a point $x$ within cell $i$ is approximated as:\n$$\nu(x) = U_i + s_i(x - x_i)\n$$\nwhere $s_i$ is a limited slope in cell $i$ to prevent spurious oscillations and ensure the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) property.\n\nFor the linear advection equation with constant speed $a0$, the information propagates from left to right. Thus, an upwind flux is appropriate. The numerical flux at the interface $x_{i+1/2}$ is determined by the state reconstructed from the upwind cell, which is cell $i$:\n$$\nF_{i+1/2} = f(U_{i+1/2}^{-}) = a U_{i+1/2}^{-}\n$$\nThe state $U_{i+1/2}^{-}$ is the value of the reconstructed solution from cell $i$ at its right boundary, $x_{i+1/2} = x_i + \\Delta x/2$:\n$$\nU_{i+1/2}^{-} = U_i + s_i \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}\n$$\nThe limited slope $s_i$ is written as $s_i = \\sigma_i / \\Delta x$, where $\\sigma_i$ is the limited difference for cell $i$. The state is then:\n$$\nU_{i+1/2}^{-} = U_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_i\n$$\nThe limited difference $\\sigma_i$ is computed using the van Leer slope limiter. This limiter acts on the ratio of successive differences to blend between first-order and second-order schemes. We define the backward difference $\\Delta_i^- = U_i - U_{i-1}$ and the forward difference $\\Delta_i^+ = U_{i+1} - U_i$. The ratio of successive differences for cell $i$ is $r_i = \\Delta_i^+ / \\Delta_i^-$. The limited difference $\\sigma_i$ is then calculated as:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = \\phi(r_i) \\Delta_i^-\n$$\nwith the van Leer limiter function given as $\\phi(r) = \\frac{r + |r|}{1 + |r|}$. This function can be simplified: it is $0$ for $r \\le 0$ and $\\frac{2r}{1+r}$ for $r  0$. The condition $r \\le 0$ occurs at local extrema or in their vicinity, where the limiter correctly sets the slope to zero to avoid creating new extrema, reverting to a first-order upwind scheme locally. For smooth, monotonic regions, $r  0$, and the limiter allows for a higher-order slope.\n\nCombining these elements, the full expression for the numerical flux at interface $i+1/2$ is:\n$$\nF_{i+1/2} = a \\left( U_i + \\frac{1}{2} \\phi\\left(\\frac{U_{i+1}-U_i}{U_i-U_{i-1}}\\right) (U_i-U_{i-1}) \\right)\n$$\nPeriodic boundary conditions are used to evaluate differences at the domain boundaries. For example, to compute $\\sigma_0$, we need $U_{-1}$, which is set to $U_{N-1}$.\n\n### 3. Time Advancement\n\nWe use the two-stage TVD Runge-Kutta method (TVD-RK2) to advance the solution from time $t^n$ to $t^{n+1} = t^n + \\Delta t$. This method is second-order accurate in time and preserves the TVD property of the spatial discretization. The two stages are:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nU^{(1)} = U^n + \\Delta t L(U^n) \\\\\nU^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} U^n + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( U^{(1)} + \\Delta t L(U^{(1)}) \\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhere $U^n$ is the vector of all cell averages $U_i$ at time $t^n$. The time step $\\Delta t$ is determined from the CFL condition. A provisional time step $\\Delta t_{prov} = C \\Delta x / a$ is calculated. To ensure the final time $T$ is reached in an integer number of steps, we compute the number of steps $N_{steps} = \\lceil T / \\Delta t_{prov} \\rceil$ and use an adjusted time step $\\Delta t = T / N_{steps}$.\n\n### 4. Error Analysis and Expected Convergence Rate\n\nThe problem requires calculating the discrete $L_2$ error at $T=1$. For $a=1$, the exact solution $u(x,1)=\\sin(2\\pi(x-1))=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ returns to its initial state. The exact cell averages at $T=1$ are therefore identical to the initial ones, $U_i(0)$. The error is computed by:\n$$\nE_{L_2}(N) = \\left( \\Delta x \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\left( U_i(T) - U_i(0) \\right)^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe observed convergence rate $p$ between two grids, $N_1$ and $N_2$, is:\n$$\np(N_1,N_2) = \\frac{\\ln\\left( E_{L_2}(N_1) / E_{L_2}(N_2) \\right)}{\\ln\\left( N_2 / N_1 \\right)}\n$$\nThe constructed scheme is formally second-order accurate. However, TVD-compliant slope limiters, including van Leer's, are known to reduce the local accuracy to first order at smooth extrema (Harten's theorem). Since the initial condition $u(x,0)=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ has a maximum and a minimum, there are two cells per period where the local truncation error (LTE) is $O(\\Delta x)$ instead of the $O(\\Delta x^2)$ achieved elsewhere.\n\nThe global error in the $L_p$ norm, $E_{L_p}$, can be analyzed by considering its dependence on the LTE. The error after $N_{steps} = T/\\Delta t \\sim O(1/\\Delta x)$ steps scales as:\n$$\nE_{L_p}^p \\approx \\Delta x \\left( \\sum_{\\text{2nd-order cells}} |e_{i}|^p + \\sum_{\\text{1st-order cells}} |e_{i}|^p \\right)\n$$\nAssuming the local cell error $e_i$ scales with the LTE, the errors are $O(\\Delta x^2)$ in the $N-k$ second-order cells and $O(\\Delta x)$ in the $k=O(1)$ first-order cells.\n$$\nE_{L_p}^p \\approx \\Delta x \\left( (N-k) \\cdot (O(\\Delta x^2))^p + k \\cdot (O(\\Delta x))^p \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $N = 1/\\Delta x$:\n$$\nE_{L_p}^p \\approx \\Delta x \\left( O(\\Delta x^{-1}) \\cdot O(\\Delta x^{2p}) + O(1) \\cdot O(\\Delta x^p) \\right) = O(\\Delta x^{2p}) + O(\\Delta x^{p+1})\n$$\nFor $p \\geq 1$, we have $2p \\ge p+1$, so the $O(\\Delta x^{p+1})$ term is dominant (or equal for $p=1$). The global error thus scales as:\n$$\nE_{L_p} \\sim \\left( O(\\Delta x^{p+1}) \\right)^{1/p} = O(\\Delta x^{(p+1)/p})\n$$\nFor the $L_2$ norm, we have $p=2$. The expected asymptotic convergence rate is therefore $(2+1)/2 = 1.5$. The numerical results should show a convergence rate approaching this value as the grid is refined.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef van_leer_limiter(r: np.ndarray) - np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the van Leer limiter function phi(r).\n    phi(r) = (r + |r|) / (1 + |r|)\n    Numerically, this is 0 for r = 0 and 2r / (1+r) for r > 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    phi = np.zeros_like(r, dtype=float)\n    mask = r > 0\n    r_masked = r[mask]\n    phi[mask] = (2 * r_masked) / (1 + r_masked)\n    return phi\n\ndef calculate_rhs(U: np.ndarray, dx: float, a: float) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the right-hand side of the finite-volume semi-discretization\n    using MUSCL reconstruction with a van Leer limiter.\n    L(U)_i = - (F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2}) / dx\n    \"\"\"\n    # Periodic boundary conditions are handled by np.roll\n    U_m1 = np.roll(U, 1)  # Stencil for U_{i-1}\n    U_p1 = np.roll(U, -1) # Stencil for U_{i+1}\n\n    # Differences centered on cell i\n    delta_b = U - U_m1      # U_i - U_{i-1}\n    delta_f = U_p1 - U      # U_{i+1} - U_i\n\n    # Ratio of successive differences, r_i = delta_f_i / delta_b_i\n    # Use a small tolerance to avoid division by zero.\n    # Where denominator is zero, ratio is zero, leading to zero slope correction.\n    r = np.zeros_like(U, dtype=float)\n    denom_is_nonzero = np.abs(delta_b) > 1e-12\n    np.divide(delta_f, delta_b, out=r, where=denom_is_nonzero)\n\n    # Calculate limited difference sigma_i for each cell i\n    phi = van_leer_limiter(r)\n    sigma = phi * delta_b\n\n    # Reconstruct the state U at the right-hand interface of each cell i (x_{i+1/2})\n    # U_{i+1/2}^- = U_i + 0.5 * sigma_i\n    U_left_at_interface = U + 0.5 * sigma\n\n    # Numerical flux at interface i+1/2 (upwind for a > 0)\n    # F_{i+1/2} = a * U_{i+1/2}^-\n    F = a * U_left_at_interface\n\n    # Flux at interface i-1/2\n    F_m1 = np.roll(F, 1)\n\n    # Compute the RHS of the semi-discrete equation\n    rhs = -(F - F_m1) / dx\n    return rhs\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function to run the simulation and compute errors and rates.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Problem parameters\n    a = 1.0\n    C = 0.4\n    T = 1.0\n    N_list = [20, 40, 80, 160]\n\n    errors_l2 = []\n    \n    for N in N_list:\n        # Grid setup\n        dx = 1.0 / N\n        x_interfaces = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, N + 1)\n        \n        # Initial condition (exact cell averages)\n        U_initial = (np.cos(2 * np.pi * x_interfaces[:-1]) - np.cos(2 * np.pi * x_interfaces[1:])) / (2 * np.pi * dx)\n        U = U_initial.copy()\n\n        # Time step adjustment to hit T exactly\n        dt_provisional = C * dx / a\n        num_steps = int(np.ceil(T / dt_provisional))\n        dt = T / num_steps\n\n        # Time integration using two-stage TVD Runge-Kutta method\n        for _ in range(num_steps):\n            # Stage 1\n            rhs1 = calculate_rhs(U, dx, a)\n            U1 = U + dt * rhs1\n            \n            # Stage 2\n            rhs2 = calculate_rhs(U1, dx, a)\n            U = 0.5 * U + 0.5 * (U1 + dt * rhs2)\n\n        # Compute discrete L2 error at T=1\n        # The exact solution at T=1 is the same as the initial condition\n        error_l2 = np.sqrt(dx * np.sum((U - U_initial)**2))\n        errors_l2.append(error_l2)\n\n    # Compute observed convergence rates\n    rates = []\n    for i in range(len(N_list) - 1):\n        N1 = N_list[i]\n        N2 = N_list[i+1]\n        E1 = errors_l2[i]\n        E2 = errors_l2[i+1]\n        # p = ln(E1/E2) / ln(N2/N1)\n        rate = np.log(E1 / E2) / np.log(N2 / N1)\n        rates.append(rate)\n\n    # Format the final output\n    results = errors_l2 + rates\n    # The print statement must produce only the required output line.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "3347636"}]}
