The forces acting on the particle are those due to its inertia, gravity, buoyancy, added mass, and Stokes drag. The Basset history force is typically neglected in such analyses for simplicity or for long-time behavior, and the heavy-particle assumption further justifies its omission.\n\nNewton's second law for the particle is $m_p \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\sum \\mathbf{F}$, where $m_p$ is the particle mass and $\\mathbf{v}$ is its velocity.

It is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid, $\\mathbf{F}_b = -m_f \\mathbf{g}$, where $m_f$ is the mass of the fluid displaced by the particle.\n3.  **Stokes Drag Force:** For a small particle Reynolds number, the drag force is given by $\\mathbf{F}_D = 3\\pi\\mu d(\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v})$.

In all tests, initialize the particle with exact initial conditions $x(0) = x^{\\star}(0)$, $v(0) = v^{\\star}(0)$, integrate to $T=1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and measure the error as the Euclidean norm of the position difference $\\|x_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - x^{\\star}(T)\\|_{2}$ in $\\mathrm{m}$. Use only radians for any angles.\n\n- Test A (temporal accuracy, fourth order): Use the analytical $u(x,t)$ and the manufactured forcing from task $1$. Integrate with the explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta method for a sequence of time steps $\\Delta t \\in \\{10^{-2}, 5\\times10^{-3}, 2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Compute the observed order $p$ from consecutive pairs via\n$$\np = \\frac{\\log(e_{1}/e_{2})}{\\log(\\Delta t_{1}/\\Delta t_{2})},\n$$\nwhere $e_{i}$ are the terminal position errors at the corresponding time steps. The test passes if both consecutive observed orders are at least $3.8$.\n\n- Test B (temporal accuracy, second order): Repeat Test A but using the explicit second-order Runge–Kutta method. The test passes if both consecutive observed orders are at least $1.8$.\n\n- Test C (spatial accuracy via bilinear interpolation): Use the explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta method with a very small time step $\\Delta t = 2\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to make temporal error negligible. Replace the analytical $u(x,t)$ by its bilinear interpolation on uniform grids with $N \\in \\{16,32,64\\}$. Compute the observed spatial order $q$ from the terminal position errors as $q = \\frac{\\log(E_{1}/E_{2})}{\\log(h_{1}/h_{2})}$ with $h = L/N$. The test passes if both consecutive observed orders are at least $1.8$.\n\n- Test D (edge case with vanishing drag): Set $c_{d} = 0$ and use the analytical $u(x,t)$. Derive the corresponding manufactured forcing from task $1$ specialized to $c_{d}=0$. Integrate with the explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta method using $\\Delta t = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The test passes if the terminal position error is less than $10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n$4.$ Your program must produce a single line of output containing the results of Tests A–D as a comma-separated list of booleans enclosed in square brackets, in the order $[\\text{A},\\text{B},\\text{C},\\text{D}]$. For example, a valid output could look like $[\\text{True},\\text{True},\\text{True},\\text{True}]$.\n\nAll physical quantities must be handled in International System of Units (meters, seconds, kilograms), and all angles must be in radians. The final outputs are booleans, which are dimensionless.\n\nProvide a complete, runnable program that performs the derivation from task $1$ symbolically to define the manufactured forcing, implements the integrators, runs the four tests with the specified parameters, and prints the single required output line in the exact format described. No user input is allowed, and the program must be self-contained.", "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and execution of a verification suite for a Lagrangian particle tracking model using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS). The process involves deriving a synthetic forcing term that makes a chosen analytical trajectory an exact solution to the governing equations, implementing numerical schemes to solve these equations, and running tests to verify the expected orders of accuracy.\n\nThe particle's state is described by its position $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and velocity $v(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The governing equations under Newton's second law with linear Stokes drag are given as:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = v\n$$\n$$\nm \\frac{dv}{dt} = c_{d}\\,\\bigl(u(x,t) - v\\bigr) + F(x,t)\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the particle mass, $c_{d}$ is the drag coefficient, $u(x,t)$ is the carrier fluid velocity, and $F(x,t)$ is the manufactured forcing term to be determined. All quantities are in SI units, and angles are in radians.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Manufactured Forcing**\n\nThe core principle of MMS is to postulate an exact analytical solution and then derive the necessary source or forcing terms that make it satisfy the governing equations. We are given the manufactured particle trajectory $x^{\\star}(t)$ and its corresponding velocity $v^{\\star}(t) = \\frac{dx^{\\star}}{dt}$ and acceleration $a^{\\star}(t) = \\frac{dv^{\\star}}{dt}$.\n$$\nx^{\\star}(t) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{0} + A \\cos(\\omega t) \\\\\ny_{0} + A \\sin(\\omega t)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nv^{\\star}(t) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n- A \\omega \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\\nA \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\na^{\\star}(t) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n- A \\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t) \\\\\n- A \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFor this trajectory to be an exact solution, the equation of motion must be satisfied at all times $t$ when the particle is at $x^{\\star}(t)$ with velocity $v^{\\star}(t)$. Substituting $(x^{\\star}(t), v^{\\star}(t), a^{\\star}(t))$ into the second governing equation yields:\n$$\nm a^{\\star}(t) = c_{d}\\,\\bigl(u(x^{\\star}(t),t) - v^{\\star}(t)\\bigr) + F(x^{\\star}(t),t)\n$$\nThe manufactured forcing $F(x^{\\star}(t),t)$ is the term required to balance this equation. We can solve for it directly. For the purpose of the simulation, we only need to evaluate this force along the known trajectory, so we define it as a function of time, $F(t) \\equiv F(x^{\\star}(t),t)$:\n$$\nF(t) = m a^{\\star}(t) - c_{d}\\,\\bigl(u(x^{\\star}(t),t) - v^{\\star}(t)\\bigr)\n$$\nThis equation provides the analytical expression for the forcing vector. Its components, $F_x(t)$ and $F_y(t)$, depend on the known functions $x^{\\star}(t)$, $v^{\\star}(t)$, $a^{\\star}(t)$, and the given carrier velocity field $u(x,y,t)$. For the special case of Test D where $c_d = 0\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$, the forcing simplifies to $F(t) = m a^{\\star}(t)$, as expected.\n\n**2. Numerical Implementation**\n\nThe particle's motion is governed by a system of four first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the state vector $Y(t) = [x(t), y(t), v_x(t), v_y(t)]^T$. The system is written as $\\frac{dY}{dt} = G(Y, t)$, where:\n$$\nG(Y, t) = \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ \\frac{1}{m} [c_d(u_x(x,y,t) - v_x) + F_x(t)] \\\\ \\frac{1}{m} [c_d(u_y(x,y,t) - v_y) + F_y(t)] \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNote that the manufactured forcing $F(t)$ is a function of time only and is evaluated using the *analytical* solution, not the numerical state $Y$. This is a crucial aspect of MMS.\n\nWe implement two explicit Runge-Kutta methods to integrate this system from $t=0$ to $t=T$:\n\n*   **Explicit Second-Order Runge-Kutta (Midpoint Method)**:\n    $$\n    k_1 = G(Y_n, t_n)\n    $$\n    $$\n    k_2 = G(Y_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} k_1, t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2})\n    $$\n    $$\n    Y_{n+1} = Y_n + \\Delta t \\, k_2\n    $$\n    This method has a theoretical second-order accuracy in time, i.e., the error is proportional to $(\\Delta t)^2$.\n\n*   **Classic Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4)**:\n    $$\n    k_1 = G(Y_n, t_n)\n    $$\n    $$\n    k_2 = G(Y_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} k_1, t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2})\n    $$\n    $$\n    k_3 = G(Y_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} k_2, t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2})\n    $$\n    $$\n    k_4 = G(Y_n + \\Delta t \\, k_3, t_n + \\Delta t)\n    $$\n    $$\n    Y_{n+1} = Y_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)\n    $$\n    This method has a theoretical fourth-order accuracy in time, i.e., error $\\propto (\\Delta t)^4$.\n\nThe evaluation of the carrier velocity $u(x,t)$ within the function $G(Y,t)$ is handled in two ways:\n1.  **Analytical Evaluation**: For temporal accuracy tests, the function for $u(x,y,t)$ is evaluated directly using its given analytical formula at the current numerical particle position $(x,y)$ and time $t$.\n2.  **Bilinear Interpolation**: For the spatial accuracy test, the carrier velocity is first computed on a uniform $N \\times N$ grid over the domain $[0,L) \\times [0,L)$ at the current time $t$. The velocity at an arbitrary particle position $(x_p, y_p)$ is then approximated using bilinear interpolation from the values at the four surrounding grid nodes. The domain is periodic, so positions and grid indices are handled with modular arithmetic. The grid spacing is $h=L/N$, and the theoretical error of bilinear interpolation is proportional to $h^2$.\n\n**3. Verification Test Suite**\n\nThe implementation is verified through four tests, with the numerical solution starting from the exact initial conditions $x(0) = x^{\\star}(0)$ and $v(0) = v^{\\star}(0)$. The error is measured as the Euclidean norm of the difference between the numerical and exact positions at the final time $T=1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, denoted $e = \\|x_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - x^{\\star}(T)\\|_{2}$. The observed order of convergence, $p$, is computed from errors $e_1$ and $e_2$ obtained with resolutions $r_1$ and $r_2$ (where $r$ is $\\Delta t$ or $h$) as $p = \\log(e_1/e_2) / \\log(r_1/r_2)$.\n\n*   **Test A (Temporal, RK4)**: Verifies the fourth-order temporal accuracy of the RK4 integrator. The observed order $p$ is expected to be close to $4$. The test passes if $p \\ge 3.8$ for two successive refinements of $\\Delta t$.\n*   **Test B (Temporal, RK2)**: Verifies the second-order temporal accuracy of the RK2 integrator. The observed order $p$ is expected to be close to $2$. The test passes if $p \\ge 1.8$ for two successive refinements of $\\Delta t$.\n*   **Test C (Spatial, Bilinear Interpolation)**: Verifies the second-order spatial accuracy of the bilinear interpolation scheme. A small $\\Delta t$ is used to make temporal errors negligible. The observed spatial order $q$ is expected to be close to $2$. The test passes if $q \\ge 1.8$ for two successive grid refinements.\n*   **Test D (Edge Case, Vanishing Drag)**: Tests the correctness of the implementation for the case $c_d = 0$. In this limit, the particle motion is independent of the fluid. The RK4 integrator with a small time step should recover the exact trajectory with very high precision. The test passes if the final position error is below $10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nPassing these tests provides strong evidence that the code correctly implements the physics of the particle model and the numerical schemes.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements and runs a verification-by-manufactured-solutions procedure\n    for a Lagrangian point-particle model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Constants (SI Units) ---\n    L = 1.0  # Domain side length [m]\n    m = 1.0e-3  # Particle mass [kg]\n    cd_base = 5.0e-3  # Baseline drag coefficient [kg/s]\n    U = 0.5  # Carrier velocity amplitude [m/s]\n    k = 2.0 * np.pi / L  # Wavenumber [rad/m]\n    sigma = 1.0  # Carrier flow frequency [rad/s]\n    x0 = 0.4 * L  # Trajectory center x [m]\n    y0 = 0.6 * L  # Trajectory center y [m]\n    A = 0.1 * L  # Trajectory amplitude [m]\n    omega = 1.3  # Trajectory frequency [rad/s]\n    T_final = 1.0  # Final integration time [s]\n\n    # --- Task 1: Analytical and Manufactured Functions ---\n\n    def x_star(t):\n        \"\"\"Exact manufactured particle position.\"\"\"\n        return np.array([x0 + A * np.cos(omega * t), y0 + A * np.sin(omega * t)])\n\n    def v_star(t):\n        \"\"\"Exact manufactured particle velocity.\"\"\"\n        return np.array([-A * omega * np.sin(omega * t), A * omega * np.cos(omega * t)])\n\n    def a_star(t):\n        \"\"\"Exact manufactured particle acceleration.\"\"\"\n        return np.array([-A * omega**2 * np.cos(omega * t), -A * omega**2 * np.sin(omega * t)])\n\n    def u_analytical(pos, t):\n        \"\"\"Analytical carrier velocity field (Taylor-Green vortex).\"\"\"\n        x_pos, y_pos = pos\n        ux = U * np.sin(k * x_pos) * np.cos(k * y_pos) * np.cos(sigma * t)\n        uy = -U * np.cos(k * x_pos) * np.sin(k * y_pos) * np.cos(sigma * t)\n        return np.array([ux, uy])\n\n    def F_manufactured(t, c_d):\n        \"\"\"Manufactured forcing term, a function of time.\"\"\"\n        pos_s, vel_s, acc_s = x_star(t), v_star(t), a_star(t)\n        u_val_at_star = u_analytical(pos_s, t)\n        force = m * acc_s -
