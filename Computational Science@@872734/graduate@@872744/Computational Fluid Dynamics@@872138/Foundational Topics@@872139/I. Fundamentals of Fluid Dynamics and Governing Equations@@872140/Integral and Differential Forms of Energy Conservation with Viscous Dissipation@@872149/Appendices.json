A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Viscous Dissipation Function $\\Phi$**\n\nThe derivation starts from the local (differential) form of the first law of thermodynamics for the total energy per unit mass, $E = e + \\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{u}|^2$, where $e$ is the internal energy per unit mass and $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector. For a continuum, the evolution of the total energy density $\\rho E$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\rho E)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho E \\mathbf{u}) = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\rho \\mathbf{f} \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + \\rho \\dot{q}_{vol} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $\\mathbf{q}$ is the heat flux vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\mathbf{f}$ is the body force per unit mass, and $\\dot{q}_{vol}$ is any volumetric heat source per unit mass. The problem states to ignore body forces ($\\mathbf{f}=0$) and volumetric heating ($\\dot{q}_{vol}=0$). Using the continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u})=0$, the energy equation can be written in terms of the material derivative $D/Dt = \\partial/\\partial t + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla$ as:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{DE}{Dt} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) $$\nTo isolate the internal energy, we subtract the equation for the rate of change of kinetic energy. The Cauchy momentum equation with no body forces is $\\rho \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. Taking the dot product with $\\mathbf{u}$ gives the kinetic energy equation:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D}{Dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{u}|^2 \\right) = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) $$\nSubtracting the kinetic energy equation from the total energy equation gives the internal energy equation:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{De}{Dt} = \\rho \\frac{DE}{Dt} - \\rho \\frac{D}{Dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{u}|^2 \\right) = \\left[-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{u})\\right] - \\left[\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\right] $$\nUsing the identity for the divergence of a tensor-vector product, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{De}{Dt} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} $$\nThe term $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$ represents the rate of work done by stresses on the fluid element per unit volume. For a Newtonian fluid, the Cauchy stress tensor is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, where $p$ is the thermodynamic pressure, $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor, and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the viscous stress tensor. Substituting this into the work term:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = (-p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}) : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = -p(\\mathbf{I} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}) + \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = -p(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} $$\nThe term $-p(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$ is the reversible work of compression. The term $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$ is the irreversible rate at which mechanical energy is converted into internal energy by viscous action. This is the viscous dissipation function per unit volume, $\\Phi$.\n$$ \\Phi = \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} $$\nThe constitutive relation for the viscous stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ for a linear Newtonian fluid is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\mu\\mathbf{S} + \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the shear viscosity, $\\lambda$ is the bulk viscosity, and $\\mathbf{S}$ is the symmetric rate-of-strain tensor:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T\\right) $$\nSubstituting the constitutive relation for $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ into the expression for $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\Phi = \\left(2\\mu\\mathbf{S} + \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I}\\right) : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = 2\\mu(\\mathbf{S} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}) + \\lambda(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})(\\mathbf{I} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}) $$\nThe velocity gradient tensor can be decomposed as $\\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{S} + \\mathbf{A}$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is the anti-symmetric spin tensor. The double dot product of a symmetric tensor ($\\mathbf{S}$) with an anti-symmetric tensor ($\\mathbf{A}$) is zero, so $\\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{A} = 0$. Thus, $\\mathbf{S} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{S} : (\\mathbf{S} + \\mathbf{A}) = \\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{S}$. Also, $\\mathbf{I} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\text{tr}(\\nabla\\mathbf{u}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$. The general expression for viscous dissipation is therefore:\n$$ \\Phi = 2\\mu(\\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{S}) + \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})^2 $$\n\n**Evaluation for Plane Couette Flow**\n\nThe velocity field is $\\mathbf{u} = (\\frac{Uy}{H}, 0, 0)$.

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe analysis begins with the differential form of the energy conservation equation. The problem asks to start from the integral form, but the derivation of the differential form from the integral form is a standard procedure in continuum mechanics. The resulting differential equation for internal energy is the appropriate starting point for this calculation. The internal energy equation, including a volumetric source term $S$, is given by:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{De}{Dt} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + S\n$$\nHere, $e$ is the specific internal energy, $\\rho$ is the density, $\\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, $\\mathbf{q}$ is the heat flux vector, and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the total stress tensor. The term $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$ represents the rate of work done by stresses.\n\nThe total stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ for a Newtonian fluid is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, where $p$ is the pressure, $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor, and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the viscous stress tensor. The stress work term is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = (-p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}) : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = -p(\\mathbf{I} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}) + \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = -p(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}\n$$\nFor an incompressible fluid, the continuity equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. Thus, the pressure work term $-p(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$ vanishes. The remaining term, $\\Phi \\equiv \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$, is the viscous dissipation function, which represents the irreversible conversion of mechanical energy into internal energy.\n\nFor a substance with constant density, the change in specific internal energy $de$ is related to the change in temperature $dT$ by $de = c_v dT$. Therefore, the material derivative is $\\frac{De}{Dt} = c_v \\frac{DT}{Dt}$. For a steady flow, the material derivative simplifies to $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla$.\n\nThe internal energy equation thus becomes:\n$$\n\\rho c_v (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T) = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\Phi + S\n$$\nOur goal is to determine the source term $S(x,y)$ that ensures this equation is satisfied for the given velocity and temperature fields. We must calculate each term: the convection term, the heat diffusion term, and the viscous dissipation term.\n\n1.  **Convection Term: $\\rho c_v (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T)$**\n    The temperature field is $T(x,y) = T_0 + ax^2 + by^2$. Its gradient is:\n    $$\n    \\nabla T = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\mathbf{i} + \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\mathbf{j} = 2ax \\mathbf{i} + 2by \\mathbf{j}\n    $$\n    The velocity field is $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = \\gamma y \\mathbf{i} + 0 \\mathbf{j}$.\n    The advection of temperature is:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T = (\\gamma y)(2ax) + (0)(2by) = 2 a \\gamma xy\n    $$\n    So, the full convection term is $2 \\rho c_v a \\gamma xy$.\n\n2.  **Heat Diffusion Term: $-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$**\n    Using Fourier's law, the heat flux vector $\\mathbf{q}$ is:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla T = -k (2ax \\mathbf{i} + 2by \\mathbf{j}) = -2kax \\mathbf{i} - 2kby \\mathbf{j}\n    $$\n    The divergence of the heat flux is:\n    $$\n    \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-2kax) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-2kby) = -2ka - 2kb = -2k(a+b)\n    $$\n    The heat diffusion term in the energy equation is therefore $-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 2k(a+b)$.\n\n3.  **Viscous Dissipation Term: $\\Phi = \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$**\n    First, we find the velocity gradient tensor, $\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$:\n    $$\n    \\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial(\\gamma y)}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial(\\gamma y)}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial(0)}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial(0)}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The viscous stress tensor for a Newtonian fluid is $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mu(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T)$.\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mu \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\mu \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma \\\\ \\gamma & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The viscous dissipation function is the tensor contraction $\\Phi = \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : \\nabla\\mathbf{u}$:\n    $$\n    \\Phi = \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\sum_{j=1}^2 \\tau_{ij} \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\tau_{xx}\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} + \\tau_{xy}\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\tau_{yx}\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} + \\tau_{yy}\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y}\n    $$\n    Substituting the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ and $\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$:\n    $$\n    \\Phi = (0)(0) + (\\mu\\gamma)(\\gamma) + (\\mu\\gamma)(0) + (0)(0) = \\mu\\gamma^2\n    $$\n    The viscous dissipation is a constant for this flow field.\n\nNow, we substitute these evaluated terms back into the internal energy equation:\n$$\n2 \\rho c_v a \\gamma xy = 2k(a+b) + \\mu\\gamma^2 + S(x,y)\n$$\nSolving for the source term $S(x,y)$ yields:\n$$\nS(x,y) = 2 \\rho c_v a \\gamma xy - 2k(a+b) - \\mu\\gamma^2\n$$\nThis is the volumetric internal energy source term required to maintain the given steady velocity and temperature profiles against convection, diffusion, and viscous heating.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\rho c_v a \\gamma xy - 2k(a+b) - \\mu\\gamma^2}\n$$", "id": "3335339"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the local differential balance, engineers often need to analyze the global energy budget for an entire system.

The Péclet number based on the hydraulic diameter is sufficiently large that axial conduction can be neglected.\n\nStarting from the Reynolds transport theorem for total energy and using appropriate reductions for the stated conditions, write the one-dimensional integral energy balance for the control volume spanning $x \\in [0,L]$ that explicitly accounts for wall heat addition, distributed shaft work input, and viscous dissipation. Then evaluate it to obtain the outlet bulk temperature $T_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nExpress the final temperature in Kelvin and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The user-provided problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, specifically the conservation of energy. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary data and relations for a unique solution without any apparent contradictions or physically implausible conditions. The thermal conductivity $k$ is given but not required for the solution, as wall heat flux is directly specified and axial conduction is neglected; this does not constitute a flaw.\n\nWe begin by applying the Reynolds Transport Theorem for energy to a differential control volume of the fluid within the duct, having a length $dx$ and cross-sectional area $A$. For steady, one-dimensional flow, the energy conservation equation is:\n$$ d\\dot{Q} + d\\dot{W}_s = d(\\dot{m} h_{total}) $$\nwhere $d\\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat transfer into the control volume, $d\\dot{W}_s$ is the rate of shaft work done on the control volume, and $h_{total}$ is the total specific enthalpy. The total enthalpy is given by $h_{total} = h + \\frac{1}{2}U^2 + gz$, where $h$ is the static specific enthalpy, $U$ is the mean velocity, and $z$ is the elevation.\n\nThe problem states that the mean axial velocity $U$ is uniform, and the flow is horizontal. Therefore, the changes in kinetic and potential energy are zero: $d(\\frac{1}{2}U^2) = 0$ and $d(gz) = 0$. The energy equation simplifies to an enthalpy balance:\n$$ d\\dot{Q} + d\\dot{W}_s = \\dot{m} dh $$\nThe differential heat transfer rate is $d\\dot{Q} = q''_w(x) P dx$ and the differential shaft work rate is $d\\dot{W}_s = \\dot{W}_s'(x) dx$. The mass flow rate $\\dot{m} = \\rho U A$ is constant. For a fluid with constant properties, the change in specific enthalpy is $dh = c_p dT + \\frac{1}{\\rho} dp$. Substituting these expressions into the balance gives:\n$$ q''_w(x) P dx + \\dot{W}_s'(x) dx = \\dot{m} \\left(c_p dT + \\frac{1}{\\rho} dp\\right) $$\nDividing by $dx$ yields the differential form of the energy equation:\n$$ q''_w(x) P + \\dot{W}_s'(x) = \\dot{m} c_p \\frac{dT}{dx} + \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nThis equation relates the temperature gradient to the heat addition, shaft work, and the pressure gradient. The problem provides a relation for the pressure gradient due to wall friction:\n$$ -\\frac{dp}{dx} = \\frac{4\\tau_w(x)}{D_h} $$\nThe hydraulic diameter is $D_h = \\frac{4A}{P}$, so $-\\frac{dp}{dx} = \\frac{4\\tau_w(x)}{4A/P} = \\frac{P\\tau_w(x)}{A}$. Thus, $\\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{P\\tau_w(x)}{A}$.\nSubstituting this into the energy equation:\n$$ q''_w(x) P + \\dot{W}_s'(x) = \\dot{m} c_p \\frac{dT}{dx} + \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho} \\left(-\\frac{P\\tau_w(x)}{A}\\right) $$\nRearranging to solve for the temperature gradient term:\n$$ \\dot{m} c_p \\frac{dT}{dx} = q''_w(x) P + \\dot{W}_s'(x) + \\frac{\\dot{m}P}{\\rho A} \\tau_w(x) $$\nUsing the definition of mass flow rate, $\\dot{m} = \\rho U A$, we can simplify the coefficient of the shear stress term: $\\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho A} = U$.\n$$ \\dot{m} c_p \\frac{dT}{dx} = q''_w(x) P + \\dot{W}_s'(x) + P U \\tau_w(x) $$\nThe term $P U \\tau_w(x)$ represents the rate of viscous dissipation per unit length, which is the irreversible conversion of mechanical energy into internal energy, thereby heating the fluid.\nTo find the outlet temperature $T_{\\text{out}}$, we integrate this equation over the entire length of the duct, from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\dot{m} c_p \\frac{dT}{dx} dx = \\int_0^L \\left( q''_w(x) P + \\dot{W}_s'(x) + P U \\tau_w(x) \\right) dx $$\n$$ \\dot{m} c_p (T_{\\text{out}} - T_{\\text{in}}) = P \\int_0^L q''_w(x) dx + \\int_0^L \\dot{W}_s'(x) dx + P U \\int_0^L \\tau_w(x) dx $$\nThis is the one-dimensional integral energy balance requested.
