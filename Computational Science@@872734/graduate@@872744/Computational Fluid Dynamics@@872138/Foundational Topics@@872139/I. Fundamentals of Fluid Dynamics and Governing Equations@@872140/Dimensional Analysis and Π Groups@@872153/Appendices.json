The variables are the drag force $F$, fluid density $\\rho$, free-stream speed $U$, characteristic length $L$, and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. The analysis will be performed using the fundamental dimensions of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$).\n\nFirst, we determine the dimensions of each of the $n=5$ variables:\n1. Drag Force, $F$: A force is mass times acceleration. $[F] = M \\cdot LT^{-2} = MLT^{-2}$.\n2. Density, $\\rho$: Mass per unit volume. $[\\rho] = M \\cdot L^{-3} = ML^{-3}$.\n3. Speed, $U$: Distance per unit time. $[U] = L \\cdot T^{-1} = LT^{-1}$.\n4. Length, $L$: A fundamental dimension. $[L] = L$.\n5. Dynamic Viscosity, $\\mu$: From the definition of shear stress $\\tau = \\mu (dU/dy)$, the dimensions are $[\\mu] = [\\tau] / [dU/dy] = (F/L^2) / (U/L) = (MLT^{-2}L^{-2}) / (LT^{-1}L^{-1}) = ML^{-1}T^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we assemble the $3 \\times 5$ dimension matrix, denoted as $A$. The rows correspond to the base dimensions ($M$, $L$, $T$) and the columns correspond to the variables ($F, \\rho, U, L, \\mu$). The entries of the matrix are the exponents of the base dimensions for each variable.\n$$\nA = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1  0  0  1 \\\\\n1  -3  1  1  -1 \\\\\n-2  0  -1  0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first column corresponds to $F$ ($M^1 L^1 T^{-2}$), the second to $\\rho$ ($M^1 L^{-3} T^0$), the third to $U$ ($M^0 L^1 T^{-1}$), the fourth to $L$ ($M^0 L^1 T^0$), and the fifth to $\\mu$ ($M^1 L^{-1} T^{-1}$).\n\nAccording to the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups, $p$, is given by $p = n - r$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $r$ is the rank of the dimension matrix. Here, $n=5$. The rank $r$ of matrix $A$ can be found by row reduction. The submatrix formed by the first three columns has a determinant of $1((-3)(-1) - (1)(0)) - 1((1)(-1) - (1)(-1)) + 0 = 3 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the rank of the $3 \\times 3$ submatrix is $3$, which implies the rank of the full $3 \\times 5$ matrix is $r=3$. The number of independent dimensionless groups is $p = 5 - 3 = 2$.\n\nTo find these groups, we need to find a basis for the null space of matrix $A$, which means finding two linearly independent vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ such that $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$. The components of each vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)^T$ will be the exponents of the variables $(F, \\rho, U, L, \\mu)$ in a dimensionless group $\\Pi = F^{x_1} \\rho^{x_2} U^{x_3} L^{x_4} \\mu^{x_5}$.\n\nA systematic way to find these groups is to select $r=3$ of the variables as \"repeating variables,\" which must be dimensionally independent. A common and physically intuitive choice is $\\{\\rho, U, L\\}$. Their dimension matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ -3  1  1 \\\\ 0  -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has a determinant of $1$, confirming they are dimensionally independent. We then form the $\\Pi$ groups by combining the remaining variables ($F$ and $\\mu$) one at a time with the repeating variables.\n\nFirst $\\Pi$ group, $\\Pi_1$, including $F$:\nWe seek a dimensionless combination $\\Pi_1 = F^{1} \\rho^{a} U^{b} L^{c}$.\nThe dimensional equation is:\n$[M^0 L^0 T^0] = [MLT^{-2}]^1 [ML^{-3}]^a [LT^{-1}]^b [L]^c = M^{1+a} L^{1-3a+b+c} T^{-2-b}$.\nEquating the exponents for each base dimension gives a system of linear equations:\n- For $M$: $1 + a = 0 \\implies a = -1$.\n- For $T$: $-2 - b = 0 \\implies b = -2$.\n- For $L$: $1 - 3a + b + c = 0 \\implies 1 - 3(-1) + (-2) + c = 0 \\implies 1 + 3 - 2 + c = 0 \\implies 2 + c = 0 \\implies c = -2$.\nThus, the exponents are $a=-1$, $b=-2$, $c=-2$. The first dimensionless group is:\n$$ \\Pi_1 = F^{1} \\rho^{-1} U^{-2} L^{-2} = \\frac{F}{\\rho U^{2} L^{2}} $$\nThis group is known as the drag coefficient, $C_D$. The corresponding null space vector is $(1, -1, -2, -2, 0)^T$.\n\nSecond $\\Pi$ group, $\\Pi_2$, including $\\mu$:\nWe seek a dimensionless combination $\\Pi_2 = \\mu^{1} \\rho^{d} U^{e} L^{f}$.\nThe dimensional equation is:\n$[M^0 L^0 T^0] = [ML^{-1}T^{-1}]^1 [ML^{-3}]^d [LT^{-1}]^e [L]^f = M^{1+d} L^{-1-3d+e+f} T^{-1-e}$.\nEquating the exponents:\n- For $M$: $1 + d = 0 \\implies d = -1$.\n- For $T$: $-1 - e = 0 \\implies e = -1$.\n- For $L$: $-1 - 3d + e + f = 0 \\implies -1 - 3(-1) + (-1) + f = 0 \\implies -1 + 3 - 1 + f = 0 \\implies 1 + f = 0 \\implies f = -1$.\nThus, the exponents are $d=-1$, $e=-1$, $f=-1$. The second dimensionless group is:\n$$ \\Pi_2 = \\mu^{1} \\rho^{-1} U^{-1} L^{-1} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho U L} $$\nThis group is the reciprocal of the Reynolds number, $Re$. Any power or reciprocal of a dimensionless group is also dimensionless and independent. By convention, the Reynolds number itself is used. Let's define $\\Pi_2' = (\\Pi_2)^{-1}$:\n$$ \\Pi_2' = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu} $$\nThis is the Reynolds number, $Re$. The corresponding null space vector is $(0, 1, 1, 1, -1)^T$.\n\nThe pair of exponent vectors $\\{(1, -1, -2, -2, 0)^T, (0, 1, 1, 1, -1)^T\\}$ forms a basis for the null space of the dimension matrix $A$. The resulting pair of independent $\\Pi$ groups, which are physically meaningful and standard in fluid dynamics, are the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{F}{\\rho U^{2} L^{2}}  \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3308390"}, {"introduction": "Dimensional analysis is more than a mechanical recipe; it is a tool that reveals the deep connections between physical assumptions and the resulting scaling laws.

A convenient choice is $\\{\\rho, \\nu, \\Delta\\}$, which collectively span $M$, $L$, and $T$. We form two $\\Pi$ groups by combining the non-repeating variables with powers of the repeating variables to cancel dimensions.\n\nFirst, construct a group involving the wall shear stress:\n\n$$\n\\Pi_{1} = \\tau_{w} \\rho^{a} \\nu^{b} \\Delta^{c}.\n$$\n\nWe require $\\Pi_{1}$ to be dimensionless. Writing dimensional balances:\n\n$$\n[M L^{-1} T^{-2}] \\cdot [M L^{-3}]^{a} \\cdot [L^{2} T^{-1}]^{b} \\cdot [L]^{c} = [M^{1+a} L^{-1 - 3a + 2b + c} T^{-2 - b}] = [1].\n$$\n\nSetting exponents to zero:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mass: } 1 + a = 0 \\Rightarrow a = -1,\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\text{Time: } -2 - b = 0 \\Rightarrow b = -2,\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\text{Length: } -1 - 3a + 2b + c = 0 \\Rightarrow -1 - 3(-1) + 2(-2) + c = 0 \\Rightarrow -1 + 3 - 4 + c = 0 \\Rightarrow c = 2.\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\Pi_{1} = \\frac{\\tau_{w} \\Delta^{2}}{\\rho \\nu^{2}}.\n$$\n\nIntroduce the friction velocity defined by $\\tau_{w} = \\rho u_{\\tau}^{2}$, which is a fundamental wall-scaling relation. Then\n\n$$\n\\Pi_{1} = \\frac{\\rho u_{\\tau}^{2} \\Delta^{2}}{\\rho \\nu^{2}} = \\left( \\frac{\\Delta u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} \\right)^{2} = (\\Delta^{+})^{2}.\n$$\n\n\nSecond, construct a group involving the wall-normal distance:\n\n$$\n\\Pi_{2} = y \\rho^{d} \\nu^{e} \\Delta^{f}.\n$$\n\nImpose dimensional neutrality:\n\n$$\n[L] \\cdot [M L^{-3}]^{d} \\cdot [L^{2} T^{-1}]^{e} \\cdot [L]^{f} = [M^{d} L^{1 - 3d + 2e + f} T^{-e}] = [1].\n$$\n\nSet exponents:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mass: } d = 0,\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\text{Time: } -e = 0 \\Rightarrow e = 0,\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\text{Length: } 1 - 3d + 2e + f = 0 \\Rightarrow 1 + f = 0 \\Rightarrow f = -1.\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\Pi_{2} = \\frac{y}{\\Delta}.\n$$\n\n\nThe pair $\\{\\Pi_{1}, \\Pi_{2}\\}$ forms a valid minimal set of independent groups. However, the choice of $\\Pi$ groups is not unique; any invertible transformation of a complete set yields an equivalent complete set. Since the physical literature on wall scaling commonly uses viscous units $y^{+} = y u_{\\tau} / \\nu$ and $\\Delta^{+} = \\Delta u_{\\tau} / \\nu$, we can recast $\\{\\Pi_{1}, \\Pi_{2}\\}$ into $\\{y^{+}, \\Delta^{+}\\}$ through the invertible mapping\n\n$$\n\\Delta^{+} = \\sqrt{\\Pi_{1}}, \\quad y^{+} = \\Pi_{2} \\Delta^{+}.\n$$\n\nThese two groups are independent and span the same two-dimensional manifold of dimensionless parameters. Therefore, the minimal complete set of groups can be taken directly as\n\n$$\n\\Pi^{(y)} = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} = y^{+}, \\qquad \\Pi^{(\\Delta)} = \\frac{\\Delta u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} = \\Delta^{+}.\n$$\n\n\nBecause the onset of log-layer mismatch in wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulation is controlled by the near-wall viscous scaling and the filter size relative to those scales, the dependence can be parameterized as a function $F(y^{+}, \\Delta^{+})$ of these two dimensionless arguments. The required final answer is the explicit pair of groups written as a single row matrix containing $y^{+}$ and $\\Delta^{+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}  \\frac{\\Delta u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3308457"}]}
