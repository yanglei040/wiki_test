The question asks to nondimensionalize the given boundary condition equation.

Using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (T_0 \\theta + T_\\infty) \\;=\\; T_0 \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y} \\;=\\; T_0 \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*} \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial y} \\;=\\; T_0 \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{T_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for the temperature gradient into the boundary condition equation:\n$$\n-\\,k\\,\\left(\\frac{T_0}{L} \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*}\\right|_{y^*=0}\\right) \\;=\\; h\\,\\left(T_w - T_\\infty\\right)\n$$\nTo obtain the form presented in the options, we isolate the dimensionless temperature gradient on the left-hand side:\n$$\n-\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*}\\right|_{y^*=0} \\;=\\; \\frac{hL}{k} \\frac{T_w - T_\\infty}{T_0}\n$$\nThe problem asks to identify the dimensionless group that emerges. The group $\\frac{hL}{k}$ is the Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}$. It represents the ratio of convective heat transfer ($h$) to conductive heat transfer ($k/L$) in the fluid at the boundary.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Nu} = \\frac{hL}{k}\n$$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n-\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*}\\right|_{w} \\;=\\; \\mathrm{Nu} \\left(\\frac{T_w - T_\\infty}{T_0}\\right)\n$$\nThe final step is to interpret the term $\\frac{T_w - T_\\infty}{T_0}$.

Its value at the wall is $\\theta_w = (T|_w - T_\\infty)/T_0$.\nThe problem states that we have an \"isothermal wall at temperature $T_w$\". This implies the temperature of the fluid at the wall is fixed at $T_w$, i.e., $T|_w = T_w$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta_w$:\n$$\n\\theta_w = \\frac{T_w - T_\\infty}{T_0}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this back into our nondimensional boundary condition:\n$$\n-\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*}\\right|_{w} \\;=\\; \\mathrm{Nu}\\,\\theta_w\n$$\nThis derivation confirms the resulting form of the boundary condition and identifies the Nusselt number as the relevant dimensionless group.

The equation form is correct, the definition of the Nusselt number is correct for heat transfer in the fluid, and the identification of $\\theta_w$ is consistent with the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The nondimensional wall boundary condition reduces to $-\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*}\\right|_{w} \\;=\\; \\theta_w$, independent of $h$, because the choice $q''_0 = k\\,T_0/L$ cancels the convective contribution.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The derived dimensionless group is the Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu} = hL/k$, which explicitly depends on the convective heat transfer coefficient $h$. The boundary condition is only independent of $h$ in the trivial case or if $\\mathrm{Nu}=1$, which is not generally true. The choice of $q''_0$ serves as a reference scale for conduction; it does not eliminate the convective parameter $h$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.

The dimensionless group that appears, $hL/k$, uses the fluid's thermal conductivity $k$ and a characteristic length $L$ of the flow. The Biot number, $\\mathrm{Bi} = hL_s/k_s$, characterizes the ratio of surface convection to internal conduction within a solid body. The problem is concerned with the thermal phenomena within the fluid, making the Nusselt number the appropriate group. The properties of the solid wall ($k_s, L_s$) are not part of the given boundary condition or the derivation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.

The language is technical and free of subjective content.\n\nA minor ambiguity exists in the definition of the Mach number $Ma = U/c$ and the thermodynamic pressure scale $p_0 = \\rho_0 c^2$. The problem defines $c$ as a local variable ($c^2 = \\gamma R T$), but $Ma$ is used as a global parameter for asymptotic analysis ($Ma \\ll 1$), and $p_0$ is a constant reference pressure. This implies that a constant reference speed of sound, $c_0$, should be used. Given the reference temperature $T_0$, the only logical interpretation is that $c$ in these definitions refers to $c_0 = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0}$. With this standard interpretation, the problem is well-posed and consistent.\n\n- **Flaw Checklist:**\n  1.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness:** None.\n  2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** None. The problem is central to computational fluid dynamics.\n  3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The minor ambiguity regarding the reference speed of sound is easily resolved by standard practice in the field, as explained above. The problem is not fundamentally incomplete or contradictory.\n  4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** None.\n  5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** None.\n  6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** None. The problem addresses a core concept in fluid dynamics with meaningful physical implications.\n  7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** None.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** under the standard interpretation that the speed of sound $c$ used in the definitions of the Mach number and the thermodynamic pressure scale is a constant reference value, $c_0=\\sqrt{\\gamma R T_0}$. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Nondimensional Momentum Equation\n\nThe dimensional momentum equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u} \\right) = - \\nabla p + \\mu \\,\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nWe substitute the dimensionless variables. First, we transform the differential operators:\n- The del operator: $\\mathbf{x} = L\\mathbf{x}^* \\implies \\nabla = \\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*$\n- The time derivative: $t = \\frac{L}{U}t^* \\implies \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t^*}$\n\nSubstituting the variables and operators into the momentum equation:\n$$ (\\rho_0 \\rho^*) \\left( \\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial (U\\mathbf{u}^*)}{\\partial t^*} + (U\\mathbf{u}^*) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*)(U\\mathbf{u}^*) \\right) = - (\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*)(p_0 p^*) + (\\mu_0 \\mu^*) (\\frac{1}{L^2}\\nabla^{*2})(U\\mathbf{u}^*) $$\nFactoring out the reference quantities:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\rho^* \\frac{U^2}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\right) = - \\frac{p_0}{L}\\nabla^* p^* + \\frac{\\mu_0 U}{L^2} \\mu^* \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nTo make the equation dimensionless, we divide all terms by the coefficient of the inertial term, which is $\\frac{\\rho_0 U^2}{L}$:\n$$ \\rho^* \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\right) = - \\frac{p_0/L}{\\rho_0 U^2/L} \\nabla^* p^* + \\frac{\\mu_0 U/L^2}{\\rho_0 U^2/L} \\mu^* \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nSimplifying the coefficients yields the general nondimensional momentum equation:\n$$ \\rho^* \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\right) = - \\left( \\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0 U^2} \\right) \\nabla^* p^* + \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\rho_0 U L} \\mu^* \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\n$$ \\rho^* \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\right) = - \\left( \\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0 U^2} \\right) \\nabla^* p^* + \\frac{1}{Re} \\mu^* \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nThe coefficient multiplying the term $-\\nabla^* p^*$ is $\\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0 U^2}$.\n\n### Analysis of Pressure Scaling and Inertial Balance\n\nThe inertial term is the left-hand side, $\\rho^* \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\right)$. By construction of the nondimensionalization, all dimensionless variables ($\\rho^*, \\mathbf{u}^*, t^*, \\mathbf{x}^*$) and their derivatives are of order one, $O(1)$. Therefore, the inertial term is of order one. For the pressure gradient term to balance the inertial term at leading order, it must also be of order one.\n\n**Case 1: Dynamic-pressure scaling, $p_0 = \\rho_0 U^2$**\nThe coefficient of $-\\nabla^* p^*$ is:\n$$ \\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0 U^2} = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^2}{\\rho_0 U^2} = 1 $$\nThe nondimensional equation is:\n$$ \\rho^* \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\right) = - \\nabla^* p^* + \\frac{1}{Re} \\mu^* \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nFor the pressure gradient term to balance the $O(1)$ inertial term, we must have:\n$$ -\\nabla^* p^* = O(1) $$\nSince the dimensionless spatial derivatives $\\nabla^*$ are $O(1)$, the magnitude of variations in the dimensionless pressure $p^*$ across the domain must be of order one. This is denoted as $p^* = O(1)$.\n\n**Case 2: Thermodynamic-pressure scaling, $p_0 = \\rho_0 c^2$**\nAs previously discussed, we use the reference speed of sound $c_0$, so $p_0 = \\rho_0 c_0^2$. The coefficient of $-\\nabla^* p^*$ is:\n$$ \\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0 U^2} = \\frac{\\rho_0 c_0^2}{\\rho_0 U^2} = \\left(\\frac{c_0}{U}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{Ma^2} $$\nwhere $Ma = U/c_0$ is the reference Mach number.\nThe nondimensional equation is:\n$$ \\rho^* \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\right) = - \\frac{1}{Ma^2} \\nabla^* p^* + \\frac{1}{Re} \\mu^* \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nFor the pressure gradient term to balance the $O(1)$ inertial term, we must have:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{Ma^2} \\nabla^* p^* = O(1) $$\nIn the low-Mach-number regime ($Ma \\ll 1$), the factor $1/Ma^2$ is very large. To maintain the balance, the term $\\nabla^* p^*$ must be correspondingly small:\n$$ \\nabla^* p^* = O(Ma^2) $$\nSince $\\nabla^*$ is $O(1)$, the magnitude of variations in the dimensionless pressure $p^*$ must be of order $Ma^2$. This is denoted as $p^* = O(Ma^2)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. With $p_0 = \\rho_0 U^2$, the coefficient is $1$, and balancing inertia requires $p^* = O(1)$.
