Using $g_{3D}$ in a two-dimensional boundary integral derivation invalidates the representation because $g_{3D}$ is not a fundamental solution of $(\\nabla^2 + k^2)$ in two dimensions; the interior field reconstructed from the boundary integral will not satisfy the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation.**\nThe fundamental solution $g$ must satisfy $(\\nabla^2_{2D} + k^2)g = -\\delta_{2D}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')$. The function $g_{3D}$ satisfies $(\\nabla^2_{3D} + k^2)g_{3D} = -\\delta_{3D}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')$. In Cartesian coordinates, $\\nabla^2_{3D} = \\nabla^2_{2D} + \\partial^2/\\partial z^2$. If we treat the 2D problem as lying in the $z=0$ plane, we have $(\\nabla^2_{2D} + k^2)g_{3D}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}') = -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}g_{3D}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}') - \\delta_{3D}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')$. This expression is not equal to $-\\delta_{2D}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')$. Because $g_{3D}$ is not the fundamental solution for the 2D operator, the volume integral in Green's identity does not simplify to $-u(\\mathbf{r}')$. A field reconstructed using the integral formula with $g_{3D}$ will not satisfy $(\\nabla^2_{2D} + k^2)u = 0$. This statement is correct.\n\n**B. When $g_{2D}$ is used, the single-layer kernel has a logarithmic singularity as $\\left| \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}' \\right| \\to 0$, and the double-layer kernel behaves like $1 / \\left| \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}' \\right|$. If $g_{3D}$ is used instead, these respective singularities are $1 / \\left| \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}' \\right|$ and $1 / \\left| \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}' \\right|^2$. This changes the numerical quadrature and regularization required on the boundary curve.**\nLet $\\rho = |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'|$.\n- For $g_{2D}$: The Hankel function has the small-argument behavior $H_0^{(1)}(z) \\approx 1 + \\frac{2i}{\\pi}(\\ln(z/2) + \\gamma_E)$. Thus, $g_{2D}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}') \\sim -\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\ln(\\rho)$. This is a logarithmic singularity. The derivative behaves as $\\frac{\\partial g_{2D}}{\\partial n} \\sim -1/(2\\pi\\rho)$.\n- For $g_{3D}$: As $\\rho \\to 0$, $g_{3D}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}') \\approx \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\rho}$. The derivative behaves as $\\frac{\\partial g_{3D}}{\\partial n} \\sim -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\rho^2}$.\nThe statement correctly identifies these singularities. A logarithmic kernel is weakly singular, a $1/\\rho$ kernel is strongly singular, and a $1/\\rho^2$ kernel is hypersingular. These require distinct numerical treatments. The statement is correct.\n\n**C. The coefficient in the jump relation of the double-layer potential across a smooth boundary is $1/4$ in two dimensions and $1/2$ in three dimensions; using $g_{3D}$ in two dimensions changes this coefficient accordingly.**\nThe coefficient $c(\\mathbf{r}')$ in the boundary integral equation $c(\\mathbf{r}') u(\\mathbf{r}') = \\int...$ depends on the solid angle subtended by the domain. For a smooth boundary point, the domain occupies half the space. In 2D, this is an angle of $\\pi$ out of $2\\pi$. In 3D, this is a solid angle of $2\\pi$ steradians out of $4\\pi$. In both cases, the fraction is $1/2$. Thus, for a smooth boundary, $c(\\mathbf{r}') = 1/2$ in both two and three dimensions. The statement is false.\n\n**D. The far-field decay associated with $g_{2D}$ is $u(\\mathbf{r}) \\sim e^{i k r} / r$ in magnitude, whereas with $g_{3D}$ it is $u(\\mathbf{r}) \\sim e^{i k r} / \\sqrt{r}$; therefore, using $g_{3D}$ produces the correct two-dimensional radiation behavior.**\nThis statement incorrectly swaps the far-field decay rates. For large argument $z$, $H_0^{(1)}(z) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi z}} e^{i(z-\\pi/4)}$.\n- For $g_{2D}$, with $r = |\\mathbf{r}| \\to \\infty$, $g_{2D} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{kr}} e^{ikr}$. The decay is $1/\\sqrt{r}$ (cylindrical wave).\n- For $g_{3D}$, with $r = |\\mathbf{r}| \\to \\infty$, $g_{3D} = \\frac{e^{ikr}}{4\\pi r}$. The decay is $1/r$ (spherical wave).\nThe statement is factually wrong.\n\n**E. Because a boundary integral in two dimensions is over a one-dimensional curve, replacing $g_{2D}$ by $g_{3D}$ while keeping the same line integral can reproduce the exact two-dimensional solution after a suitable reweighting of the boundary density; the dimension of the fundamental solution is immaterial.**\nThis is false. As established in A, using the wrong Green's function generates a field that does not satisfy the governing PDE. No reweighting of the boundary source can fix this fundamental mismatch. The dimension of the Green's function is critical.\n\n**F. The two-dimensional Sommerfeld radiation condition is $\\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{r} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} - i k u \\right) = 0$, while the three-dimensional one is $\\lim_{r \\to \\infty} r \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} - i k u \\right) = 0$. Using $g_{3D}$ in a two-dimensional setting enforces the wrong decay and leads to an incorrect exterior boundary integral equation.**\nThe SRCs are stated correctly for their respective dimensions, reflecting the $1/\\sqrt{r}$ decay in 2D and $1/r$ decay in 3D. A solution constructed using an integral representation inherits the far-field behavior of its Green's function. Using $g_{3D}$ in a 2D context would generate a solution that decays as $1/r$, violating the required 2D SRC. This failure to satisfy the correct condition at infinity yields an incorrect, non-physical solution.

The strategy must be exact and handle both the weak singularity of $g$ (behaves as $1/R$) and the strong singularity of $\\nabla g$ (behaves as $1/R^2$).\n\nA valid strategy involves decomposing the singular kernel $K$ into a known singular part $K_s$ and a regular (bounded) part $K_r$, such that $K = K_s + K_r$. The integral is then split: $\\int K dS' = \\int K_s dS' + \\int K_r dS'$. The integral of $K_s$ is computed analytically, while the integral of the well-behaved $K_r$ is computed using standard numerical quadrature.\n\nLet's apply this method to the Green's function $g(R)$. The singularity is captured by the static Green's function, $g_0(R) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi R}$. We define the decomposition as:\n$$ g(R) = g_0(R) + g_{\\mathrm{reg}}(R) $$\n$$ g_{\\mathrm{reg}}(R) = g(R) - g_0(R) = \\frac{e^{ikR} - 1}{4\\pi R} $$\nTo verify that $g_{\\mathrm{reg}}(R)$ is regular, we examine its limit as $R \\to 0$ using the Taylor series $e^{ikR} = 1 + ikR + O(R^2)$:\n$$ \\lim_{R\\to 0} g_{\\mathrm{reg}}(R) = \\lim_{R\\to 0} \\frac{(1 + ikR + O(R^2)) - 1}{4\\pi R} = \\lim_{R\\to 0} \\frac{ikR + O(R^2)}{4\\pi R} = \\frac{ik}{4\\pi} $$\nThe remainder is bounded at $R=0$, making it suitable for numerical quadrature.\n\nNext, we apply the same decomposition to the gradient, $\\nabla g = \\nabla g_0 + \\nabla g_{\\mathrm{reg}}$.

It correctly identifies the singular ($g_0$) and regular ($g_{\\mathrm{reg}}$) parts for both $g$ and its gradient. It correctly proposes analytical integration for the singular parts and numerical quadrature for the regular parts. This method is exact and handles all singularities properly.\n\n**B.** This approach is flawed. The remainder term is $\\frac{e^{ikR}-e^{-ikR_c}}{4\\pi R}$. As $R \\to 0$ (and $R_c$ is a non-zero constant), the remainder behaves as $\\frac{1-e^{-ikR_c}}{4\\pi R}$, which is still singular as $1/R$. The singularity is not removed. Ignoring the gradient term's stronger singularity is also a critical error.\n\n**C.** This method is incorrect. The proposed term $h$ is more singular ($1/R^2$) than the original kernel $g$ ($1/R$). The integral of $h$ over a surface is divergent. Subtracting a divergent term is not a valid mathematical procedure.\n\n**D.** This describes a regularization technique, not an exact singularity subtraction.
