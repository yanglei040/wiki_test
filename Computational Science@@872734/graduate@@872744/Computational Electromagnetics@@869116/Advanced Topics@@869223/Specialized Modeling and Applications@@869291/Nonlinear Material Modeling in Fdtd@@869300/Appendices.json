The problem provides this as:\n$$D = \\epsilon_0 E + P$$\nwhere $P$ is the material polarization. The problem further specifies the nonlinear polarization as:\n$$P_{\\text{NL}} = \\epsilon_0 \\chi^{(3)} |E|^{2} E$$\nThe problem setup implies that the linear part of the polarization is zero (i.e., the linear relative permittivity $\\epsilon_r = 1$), so the total polarization is just the nonlinear part, $P = P_{\\text{NL}}$. Therefore, the full constitutive relation is:\n$$D = \\epsilon_0 E + \\epsilon_0 \\chi^{(3)} |E|^{2} E$$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$D = \\epsilon_0 \\left(1 + \\chi^{(3)} |E|^2 \\right) E$$\nHere, $D$, $E$, $\\epsilon_0$, and $\\chi^{(3)}$ are all in SI units.\n\nNext, we introduce the dimensionless variables (also known as code units) used in the FDTD simulation. These are defined by scaling the physical quantities:\n$$E = E_{s} \\tilde{E}$$\n$$t = t_{s} \\tilde{t}$$\n$$\\nabla = \\frac{1}{x_{s}} \\tilde{\\nabla}$$\nwhere $E_s$, $t_s$, and $x_s$ are the scaling constants for the electric field, time, and length, respectively. The tilde (~) denotes a dimensionless quantity.\n\nTo properly normalize the constitutive relation, we must also define a dimensionless electric flux density, $\\tilde{D}$. A consistent scaling for $D$ is derived from the requirement that Maxwell's curl equations become coefficient-free in the new units. Ampere's law is $\\nabla \\times H = \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial t}$. For the dimensionless form $\\tilde{\\nabla} \\times \\tilde{H} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{D}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}}$ to hold, and given a standard scaling for the magnetic field $H_s = E_s / Z_0$ (where $Z_0 = \\sqrt{\\mu_0/\\epsilon_0}$ is the impedance of free space) and the condition $t_s = x_s/c$, the scaling factor for $D$ must be:\n$$D_s = \\frac{t_s}{x_s} H_s = \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{E_s}{Z_0} = \\frac{1}{c} E_s \\left(c \\epsilon_0\\right) = \\epsilon_0 E_s$$\nThus, the dimensionless electric flux density is:\n$$\\tilde{D} = \\frac{D}{D_s} = \\frac{D}{\\epsilon_0 E_s}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the scaled variables into the physical constitutive relation to find the corresponding dimensionless relation.\n$$\\tilde{D} = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 \\left(1 + \\chi^{(3)} |E|^2 \\right) E}{\\epsilon_0 E_s}$$\nCancel $\\epsilon_0$:\n$$\\tilde{D} = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\chi^{(3)} |E|^2 \\right) E}{E_s}$$\nSubstitute $E = E_s \\tilde{E}$:\n$$\\tilde{D} = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\chi^{(3)} |E_s \\tilde{E}|^2 \\right) (E_s \\tilde{E})}{E_s}$$\nSimplify by canceling $E_s$:\n$$\\tilde{D} = \\left(1 + \\chi^{(3)} E_s^2 |\\tilde{E}|^2 \\right) \\tilde{E}$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\\tilde{D} = \\tilde{E} + \\left( \\chi^{(3)} E_s^2 \\right) |\\tilde{E}|^2 \\tilde{E}$$\nThis equation is the dimensionless form of the constitutive relation.

This preserves the overall second-order accuracy of the FDTD scheme, as the polarization term is then updated with the same order of accuracy as the other terms in Maxwell's equations on the Yee grid.\nAn alternative way to see this is that the standard FDTD method is second-order accurate because it uses central differences that are centered at half-integer time-steps (e.g., $t^{n+1/2}$).

Substituting this gives the final symbolic expression for the Lipschitz constant:\n$$\nL = \\frac{6\\chi^{(3)}I_{\\max}}{n_{0}^2 n_{0}\\epsilon_{0}c} = \\frac{6\\chi^{(3)}I_{\\max}}{n_{0}^3 \\epsilon_{0}c}\n$$\nThe units of this expression are $(\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{V}^2)(\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^2) / ((\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m})(\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})) = (\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{V}^2)/(\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{s})$. Since $\\mathrm{W} = \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{s}$ and $\\mathrm{F} = \\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{V}$, and $\\mathrm{J} = \\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{C}$, this simplifies to $((\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{s})/\\mathrm{V}^2) / ((\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{V})/\\mathrm{s}) = (\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{V}^2)/(\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{V}) = \\mathrm{J}/(\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{C}) = 1$. The Lipschitz constant $L$ is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $L$ numerically using the provided parameter values for fused silica:\n$n_{0} = 1.45$\n$\\chi^{(3)} = 2.7 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\!/\\mathrm{V}^{2}$\n$I_{\\max} = 5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$\\epsilon_{0} = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}$\n$c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$\n\nLet's compute the numerator and denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\n6 \\times (2.7 \\times 10^{-22}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{12}) = 8.1 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\nn_{0}^3 \\epsilon_{0} c = (1.45)^3 \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^{8})\n$$\n$$\n(1.45)^3 = 3.048625\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{0} c \\approx (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}) \\approx 2.65441873 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{S}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} \\approx 3.048625 \\times (2.65441873 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 8.092493 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nNow we compute the ratio:\n$$\nL = \\frac{8.1 \\times 10^{-9}}{8.092493 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 1.0009275 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nL \\approx 1.001 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nThe small value of $L \\ll 1$ indicates that the fixed-point iteration is a contraction mapping under these conditions and will converge rapidly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.001 \\times 10^{-6}}$$", "id": "3334803"}]}
