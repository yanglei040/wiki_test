In the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) and its refinement, the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD), diffraction by a perfectly sharp straight edge produces rays that emanate from the diffraction point along the surface of a cone whose axis is the edge tangent. This “Keller cone” is defined by the condition that the polar angle of the diffracted ray with respect to the edge axis equals the polar angle of the incident ray with respect to the same axis.\n\nA straight semi-infinite perfectly conducting half-plane has its edge aligned with the $z$-axis. A point source is located at position $\\mathbf{r}_s = (-2.0,\\; 1.0,\\; 0.5)\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

The polar angle of incidence, $\\theta_i$, is the angle between $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_i$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{t}}$.\n    $$\n    \\cos(\\theta_i) = \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_i \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{t}} = \\frac{0.7}{\\sqrt{5.49}}\n    $$\n    The sine of the polar angle is\n    $$\n    \\sin(\\theta_i) = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^{2}(\\theta_i)} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.7)^2}{5.49}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5.49 - 0.49}{5.49}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5.0}{5.49}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5.49}}\n    $$\n    The azimuthal angle of incidence, $\\phi_i$, is determined from the $x$ and $y$ components of $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_i$.

This would introduce a sign change in the physical optics current, but it does not alter the functional form of the resulting scalar transition function $F(X)$. The core task of deriving the function $F(X)$ from its defining properties and relating it to standard mathematical functions remains valid. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Transition Function $F(X)$\n\nThe total field in uniform asymptotic theories, such as UTD, is expressed near a geometrical optics boundary as the sum of the GO field multiplied by a transition function and a continuous, slow-varying diffracted field contribution. Near the shadow boundary, the GO field consists only of the incident field, $E_{\\mathrm{GO}} = E^{\\mathrm{inc}}$, in the lit region and is zero in the shadow region. The total field $E_{\\mathrm{total}}$ must be continuous. The transition function $F(X)$ is introduced to smoothly transition the field across the boundary. The total field is written as:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx E^{\\mathrm{inc}} F(X) + E_{\\mathrm{diff,smooth}}\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{diff,smooth}}$ is a well-behaved remainder term. The function $F(X)$ must encapsulate the rapid transition. The properties imposed on $F(X)$ in the problem statement ($F(X)\\to 1$ deep in the lit region, $F(X)\\to 0$ deep in the shadow region, and $F(0)=1/2$ at the boundary) uniquely define its mathematical form.\n\nThe physical optics formulation approximates the scattered field by the radiation from the induced current on the lit portion of the scatterer. For the TE case, the scattered electric field $E_z^{\\mathrm{scat}}$ is obtained from the radiation integral involving the PO current $J_{s,z}^{\\mathrm{PO}}$ and the 2D Green's function for free space (with the $e^{-i\\omega t}$ time convention):\n$$\nE_z^{\\mathrm{scat}}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{k\\eta}{4} \\int_{x'=0}^{\\infty} J_{s,z}^{\\mathrm{PO}}(x') H_0^{(2)}(k|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|) \\,dx'\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}' = x'\\hat{x}$, $|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'| = \\sqrt{(\\rho\\cos\\phi-x')^2 + (\\rho\\sin\\phi)^2}$, and $J_{s,z}^{\\mathrm{PO}}$ is derived from the incident magnetic field.\n\nA uniform asymptotic evaluation of this integral is a standard procedure in UTD. This procedure maps the radiation integral onto a canonical integral form. For an edge diffraction problem, this canonical integral is the Fresnel integral. The result of this evaluation, when combined with the incident field, leads to the uniform representation involving the transition function. The argument of this function, $X$, is a dimensionless parameter that measures the observer's distance from the shadow boundary in terms of Fresnel zones.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the explicit form of $F(X)$ that satisfies the given limiting conditions. This function is universally defined (up to a choice of special function representation) by these properties. The standard representation of this transition function, consistent with the $e^{-i\\omega t}$ time convention, is the Kouyoumjian-Pathak function, which is given in terms of the Fresnel integral:\n$$\nF(X) = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/4}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_X^\\infty e^{i\\tau^2} \\,d\\tau\n$$\nLet's verify this function meets the requirements. The integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i\\tau^2}d\\tau = \\sqrt{\\pi/(-i)} = \\sqrt{\\pi} e^{i\\pi/4}$.\n- For $X \\to +\\infty$, the integral vanishes, so $F(X) \\to 0$.\n- For $X \\to -\\infty$, the integral becomes $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i\\tau^2}d\\tau = \\sqrt{\\pi} e^{i\\pi/4}$, so $F(X) \\to \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/4}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} (\\sqrt{\\pi}e^{i\\pi/4}) = 1$.\n- For $X=0$, $F(0) = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/4}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^\\infty e^{i\\tau^2}d\\tau$. Since the integrand is an even function, this is half the integral over the full real axis. $F(0) = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/4}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{\\pi}e^{i\\pi/4}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe properties match perfectly. The task is now to express this form of $F(X)$ using the complementary error function, $\\mathrm{erfc}(z)$, which is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{erfc}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_z^\\infty e^{-t^2} \\,dt\n$$\nWe need to transform the integral $\\int_X^\\infty e^{i\\tau^2} \\,d\\tau$ into the form of the integral defining $\\mathrm{erfc}(z)$. We perform a change of variable in the integration. Let $t^2 = -i\\tau^2$. This implies $t = \\tau\\sqrt{-i} = \\tau e^{-i\\pi/4}$. The differential is $dt = e^{-i\\pi/4}d\\tau$.\nTherefore, $d\\tau = e^{i\\pi/4}dt$. The limits of integration also transform: the lower limit becomes $X e^{-i\\pi/4}$. As $\\tau \\to \\infty$ along the real axis, $t \\to \\infty$ along the line in the complex plane with angle $-\\pi/4$.

In Geometrical Optics (GO), the field in the geometric shadow of the half-plane vanishes, while in the illuminated region it equals the incident field. However, near the shadow boundary this description is nonuniform. The Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) introduces a transition function that multiplies the GO field and yields a uniform approximation valid across the shadow boundary.\n\nStarting from the Huygens–Fresnel–Kirchhoff integral representation for the half-plane diffraction problem, and applying the method of steepest descents uniformly through the shadow boundary by appropriately scaling the boundary-layer variable (denoted $\\nu$) associated with the distance of the observation point to the shadow boundary, derive the closed-form analytic expression for the UTD transition function $F(\\nu)$ that multiplies the GO field.

Angles, if introduced, should be taken in radians.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a canonical question in the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) within computational electromagnetics, which has a unique and verifiable solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the UTD transition function, $F(\\nu)$, which provides a uniform description of the field across the shadow boundary created by a diffracting half-plane. This function corrects the non-uniformity of the Geometrical Optics (GO) field, which abruptly drops to zero in the shadow region. The derivation is consistent with a suppressed $e^{-i\\omega t}$ time dependence.\n\nWe begin by considering the diffraction of a plane wave by a perfectly conducting half-plane. A formal starting point is the Huygens-Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction formula. For a scalar field $u$, the field at an observation point $P$ is given by an integral over an aperture $\\mathcal{A}$. Let's consider a simplified two-dimensional ($2$D) geometry for clarity. Let a plane wave $u_{inc}(x', y') = \\exp(iky')$ be incident normally on the plane $y'=0$, which contains a half-plane screen at $x'0$. The aperture is thus the half-line $\\{x'0, y'=0\\}$.\n\nUnder the paraxial approximation (for an observation point $(x,y)$ far from the aperture, i.e., $y \\gg x, x'$), the Kirchhoff integral can be simplified to the Fresnel diffraction integral. The field $u(x,y)$ is proportional to the incident field at the observation point, $\\exp(iky)$, multiplied by an integral over the aperture variable $x'$:\n$$\nu(x,y) \\propto \\exp(iky) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(i k \\frac{(x-x')^2}{2y}\\right) dx'\n$$\nTo transform this into a canonical form, we introduce a change of variables. Let $\\tau^2 = \\frac{k}{2y}(x'-x)^2$. We define a new integration variable $\\tau$ such that $\\tau = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2y}}(x'-x)$. The differential is $d\\tau = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2y}}dx'$. The integration limits transform as follows: for $x' \\to \\infty$, we have $\\tau \\to \\infty$; for $x'=0$, we have $\\tau = -x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2y}}$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-x\\sqrt{k/2y}}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\tau^2) d\\tau\n$$\nThe total field is thus proportional to $u_{inc}$ and this integral. We identify the lower limit of the integral as the boundary-layer variable $\\nu$ (or a quantity proportional to it), which measures the signed distance from the shadow boundary at $x=0$. Let's define:\n$$\n\\nu = -x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2y}}\n$$\nWith this definition, $\\nu=0$ on the shadow boundary ($x=0$), $\\nu > 0$ in the shadow region ($x0$), and $\\nu  0$ in the lit region ($x0$).\n\nThe UTD seeks a total field written as $E_{\\text{UTD}} = E_{\\text{inc}} F(\\nu)$, which must smoothly transition from $E_{\\text{inc}}$ in the lit region to $0$ in the shadow region. This requires the transition function $F(\\nu)$ to satisfy $F(\\nu) \\to 1$ as $\\nu \\to -\\infty$ (deep in the lit region) and $F(\\nu) \\to 0$ as $\\nu \\to +\\infty$ (deep in the shadow).\nThe integral form $\\int_{\\nu}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\tau^2) d\\tau$ has the desired behavior. To normalize it to $1$ for $\\nu \\to -\\infty$, we divide by its value at $\\nu = -\\infty$, which is $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\tau^2) d\\tau = \\sqrt{\\pi}\\exp(i\\pi/4)$.\nThus, the transition function is:\n$$\nF(\\nu) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\exp(i\\pi/4)} \\int_{\\nu}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\tau^2) d\\tau = \\frac{\\exp(-i\\pi/4)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{\\nu}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\tau^2) d\\tau\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the UTD transition function $F(\\nu)$, commonly known as the Kouyoumjian-Pathak transition function.\n\nNext, we compute the normalized field ratio $E_{\\text{UTD}}(\\mathbf{r})/E_{\\text{inc}}(\\mathbf{r})$ at the shadow boundary, which corresponds to $\\nu=0$. This ratio is given by $F(0)$.\n$$\nF(0) = \\frac{\\exp(-i\\pi/4)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\tau^2) d\\tau\n$$\nThe definite integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\tau^2) d\\tau$ is a standard Fresnel-type integral. Its value can be found using contour integration or by relating it to the Gamma function.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\tau^2) d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (\\cos(\\tau^2) + i\\sin(\\tau^2)) d\\tau = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{8}} + i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{8}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\exp(i\\pi/4)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $F(0)$:\n$$\nF(0) = \\frac{\\exp(-i\\pi/4)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\exp(i\\pi/4) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSo, at the shadow boundary, the field strength is exactly half that of the incident field.
