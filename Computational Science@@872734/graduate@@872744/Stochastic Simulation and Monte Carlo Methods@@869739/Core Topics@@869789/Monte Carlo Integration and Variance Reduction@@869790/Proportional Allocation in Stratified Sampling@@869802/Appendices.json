The second term, $\\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{h=1}^{H} N_h S_h^2$, is constant with respect to the allocation. Thus, the problem reduces to minimizing the quantity $\\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{N_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h}$ subject to the constraint $\\sum_{h=1}^{H} n_h = n$.\n\nThe problem states to assume that the within-stratum variances are equal, i.e., $S_h^2 = S^2$ for all $h \\in \\{1, \\dots, H\\}$. The expression to minimize becomes $\\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{N_h^2 S^2}{n_h} = S^2 \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{N_h^2}{n_h}$. Since $S^2$ is a positive constant, this is equivalent to minimizing $\\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{N_h^2}{n_h}$.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

The final integer allocations are $n_1=60$, $n_2=30$, and $n_3=10$. The specified apportionment procedure (the largest remainder method) is not required, as there are no fractional parts to apportion.\n\nFinally, we compute the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\|\\hat{p})$.\nFirst, we find the population stratum proportions, $p_h = N_h/N$:\n$$ p_1 = \\frac{600}{1000} = 0.6 $$\n$$ p_2 = \\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3 $$\n$$ p_3 = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1 $$\nSo the population distribution is $p = (0.6, 0.3, 0.1)$.\n\nNext, we find the realized sampling proportions, $\\hat{p}_h = n_h/n$:\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{60}{100} = 0.6 $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_2 = \\frac{30}{100} = 0.3 $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_3 = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.1 $$\nSo the sampling distribution is $\\hat{p} = (0.6, 0.3, 0.1)$.\n\nThe two distributions are identical, i.e., $p_h = \\hat{p}_h$ for all $h$. The KL divergence is defined as:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\|\\hat{p}) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} p_h \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_h}{\\hat{p}_h}\\right) $$\nSince $p_h/\\hat{p}_h = 1$ for all $h=1,2,3$, and $\\ln(1)=0$, the expression becomes:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p\\|\\hat{p}) = \\sum_{h=1}^{3} p_h \\ln(1) = \\sum_{h=1}^{3} p_h \\times 0 = 0 $$\nThe KL divergence is exactly $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3332354"}, {"introduction": "While proportional allocation is simple and widely used, it is not always the most efficient strategy.

Since the strata are sampled independently, the random variables $\\bar{X}_{h}$ are independent. Consequently, the terms $w_{h} \\bar{X}_{h}$ are also independent.

For a random variable $X_h \\sim U(S_h)$, this is:\n$$\n\\mu_h = \\mathbb{E}[f(X_h)]\n$$\nFor stratum $S_1 = [0, 0.5)$, the random variable $X_1$ follows a uniform distribution $U(0, 0.5)$, with a probability density function (PDF) $p_1(x) = \\frac{1}{0.5-0} = 2$ for $x \\in [0, 0.5)$.\n$$\n\\mu_1 = \\mathbb{E}[X_1^2] = \\int_{0}^{0.5} x^2 p_1(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{0.5} x^2 (2) \\,dx = 2 \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{0.5} = 2 \\left( \\frac{(1/2)^3}{3} - 0 \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{12}\n$$\nFor stratum $S_2 = [0.5, 1]$, the random variable $X_2$ follows a uniform distribution $U(0.5, 1)$, with a PDF $p_2(x) = \\frac{1}{1-0.5} = 2$ for $x \\in [0.5, 1]$.\n$$\n\\mu_2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_2^2] = \\int_{0.5}^{1} x^2 p_2(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0.5}^{1} x^2 (2) \\,dx = 2 \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{0.5}^{1} = 2 \\left( \\frac{1^3}{3} - \\frac{(1/2)^3}{3} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{7}{12}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the expectation of the estimator:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{I}] = W_1 \\mu_1 + W_2 \\mu_2 = (0.5) \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) + (0.5) \\left(\\frac{7}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1+7}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe true value of the integral is $I = \\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \\,dx = [\\frac{x^3}{3}]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, the estimator is unbiased, as $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{I}] = I$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Variance $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{I})$**\n\nSince the samples from different strata are independent, the random variables $\\bar{Y}_1$ and $\\bar{Y}_2$ are independent. The variance of their weighted sum is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{I}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^{2} W_{h}\\,\\bar{Y}_{h}\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^{2} W_{h}^2\\,\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{h})\n$$\nWithin each stratum $h$, the samples $Y_{h,i}$ are independent and identically distributed. Let $\\sigma_h^2$ be the variance of a single observation in stratum $h$. The variance of the sample mean is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{Y}_h) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_h}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_h} Y_{h,i}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n_h^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_h} \\operatorname{Var}(Y_{h,i}) = \\frac{n_h \\sigma_h^2}{n_h^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_h^2}{n_h}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{I})$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{I}) = \\sum_{h=1}^{2} W_h^2 \\frac{\\sigma_h^2}{n_h}\n$$\nUsing proportional allocation, $n_h = W_h n$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{I}) = \\sum_{h=1}^{2} W_h^2 \\frac{\\sigma_h^2}{W_h n} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{h=1}^{2} W_h \\sigma_h^2\n$$\nWe need to compute the within-stratum variances, $\\sigma_h^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(f(X_h)) = \\mathbb{E}[f(X_h)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[f(X_h)])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_h^4] - \\mu_h^2$.\n\nFor stratum $S_1 = [0, 0.5)$ with $X_1 \\sim U(0, 0.5)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4] = \\int_{0}^{0.5} x^4 p_1(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{0.5} x^4 (2) \\,dx = 2 \\left[ \\frac{x^5}{5} \\right]_{0}^{0.5} = 2 \\left( \\frac{(1/2)^5}{5} \\right) = \\frac{2}{5 \\cdot 32} = \\frac{1}{80}\n$$\nThe variance $\\sigma_1^2$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_1^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_1^4] - \\mu_1^2 = \\frac{1}{80} - \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{80} - \\frac{1}{144} = \\frac{9}{720} - \\frac{5}{720} = \\frac{4}{720} = \\frac{1}{180}\n$$\nFor stratum $S_2 = [0.5, 1]$ with $X_2 \\sim U(0.5, 1)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_2^4] = \\int_{0.5}^{1} x^4 p_2(x) \\,dx = \\int_{0.5}^{1} x^4 (2) \\,dx = 2 \\left[ \\frac{x^5}{5} \\right]_{0.5}^{1} = \\frac{2}{5} \\left( 1^5 - (1/2)^5 \\right) = \\frac{2}{5} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{32} \\right) = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{31}{32} = \\frac{31}{80}\n$$\nThe variance $\\sigma_2^2$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_2^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_2^4] - \\mu_2^2 = \\frac{31}{80} - \\left(\\frac{7}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{31}{80} - \\frac{49}{144} = \\frac{31 \\cdot 9}{720} - \\frac{49 \\cdot 5}{720} = \\frac{279 - 245}{720} = \\frac{34}{720} = \\frac{17}{360}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the variance of the estimator $\\hat{I}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{I}) = \\frac{1}{n} (W_1 \\sigma_1^2 + W_2 \\sigma_2^2) = \\frac{1}{100} \\left( (0.5)\\left(\\frac{1}{180}\\right) + (0.5)\\left(\\frac{17}{360}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{I}) = \\frac{1}{100} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{180} + \\frac{17}{360} \\right) = \\frac{1}{200} \\left( \\frac{2}{360} + \\frac{17}{360} \\right) = \\frac{1}{200} \\cdot \\frac{19}{360} = \\frac{19}{72000}\n$$\nThe expectation is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the variance is $\\frac{19}{72000}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{19}{72000} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3332372"}]}
