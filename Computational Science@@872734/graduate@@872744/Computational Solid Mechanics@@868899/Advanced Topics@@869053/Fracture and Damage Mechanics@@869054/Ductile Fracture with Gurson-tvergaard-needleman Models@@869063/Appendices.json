The definitions of void volume fraction and plastic volumetric strain rate are standard. The assumptions, such as a plastically incompressible matrix and constant strain rate, are common idealizations used to derive fundamental relationships within this framework. The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective, sufficient initial conditions, and unambiguous definitions. It is objective and free of non-scientific claims. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation\nThe evolution of the void volume fraction, $f(t)$, is obtained by taking its time derivative. The void volume fraction is defined as:\n$$\nf(t) = \\frac{V_v(t)}{V(t)}\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation with respect to time $t$, we get:\n$$\n\\dot{f} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{V_v}{V}\\right) = \\frac{\\dot{V}_v V - V_v \\dot{V}}{V^2} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_v}{V} - \\frac{V_v}{V} \\frac{\\dot{V}}{V} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_v}{V} - f \\frac{\\dot{V}}{V}\n$$\nThe total rate of change of void volume fraction, $\\dot{f}$, is the sum of the rate due to void nucleation, $\\dot{f}_{\\text{nucl}}$, and the rate due to void growth, $\\dot{f}_{\\text{growth}}$. The problem states that there is no void nucleation, so $\\dot{f}_{\\text{nucl}} = 0$, which means $\\dot{f} = \\dot{f}_{\\text{growth}}$.\n\nThe equation for void growth is derived from the conservation of the matrix volume during plastic deformation. The matrix volume is $V_m = V - V_v = V(1 - f)$. The rate of change of the matrix volume is:\n$$\n\\dot{V}_m = \\frac{d}{dt}[V(1-f)] = \\dot{V}(1-f) - V\\dot{f}\n$$\nThe problem states that the matrix is plastically incompressible. This means the plastic volume change of the matrix material is zero. Its volume can change only elastically. In models of ductile fracture, plastic strains are typically much larger than elastic strains, so it is a common and valid simplification to assume the material is rigid-plastic, meaning elastic strains are neglected. Under this assumption, the total volume of the matrix material is considered constant, so $\\dot{V}_m = 0$.\nSetting $\\dot{V}_m = 0$ in the equation above yields:\n$$\n0 = \\dot{V}(1-f) - V\\dot{f}\n$$\nRearranging for $\\dot{f}$ gives a relationship between the void fraction evolution and the total volumetric strain rate of the RVE:\n$$\n\\dot{f} = (1-f) \\frac{\\dot{V}}{V}\n$$\nThe term $\\dot{V}/V$ is the total volumetric strain rate, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}})$. We need to relate this to the given plastic volumetric strain rate, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p)$.\n\nThe total plastic volume change rate of the RVE, $\\dot{V}^p$, is given. Because the matrix is plastically incompressible, all plastic volume change must come from the change in void volume. That is, $\\dot{V}^p = \\dot{V}_v$.\nUnder the rigid-plastic assumption, elastic strains are ignored, so the total strain rate equals the plastic strain rate: $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} \\approx \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p$. This implies the total volumetric strain rate is equal to the plastic volumetric strain rate: $\\dot{V}/V \\approx \\dot{V}^p/V$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\dot{f}$:\n$$\n\\dot{f} = (1-f) \\frac{\\dot{V}^p}{V}\n$$\nUsing the problem's definition, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p) = \\dot{V}^p/V$. Thus, we arrive at the standard equation for void growth:\n$$\n\\dot{f} = (1-f) \\mathrm{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p)\n$$\nThis is the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $f(t)$.\n\n### Step 4: Solution of the Ordinary Differential Equation\nWe are given that $\\mathrm{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p) = c$, where $c$ is a positive constant. Substituting this into the ODE gives:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dt} = c(1-f)\n$$\nThis is a first-order, linear, separable differential equation. We can separate the variables $f$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{1-f} = c \\, dt\n$$\nTo find the particular solution, we integrate both sides from the initial state $(t=0, f=f_0)$ to a general state $(t, f(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{f_0}^{f(t)} \\frac{1}{1-\\tilde{f}} \\, d\\tilde{f} = \\int_{0}^{t} c \\, d\\tau\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{f}$ and $\\tau$ are dummy integration variables.\n\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\n[-\\ln(1-\\tilde{f})]_{f_0}^{f(t)} = [c\\tau]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nNote that since $0  f_0  1$ and $f(t)$ represents a physical volume fraction that must be less than $1$, the argument of the logarithm, $1-\\tilde{f}$, is always positive.\n$$\n-\\ln(1-f(t)) - (-\\ln(1-f_0)) = c(t-0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(1-f_0) - \\ln(1-f(t)) = ct\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-f_0}{1-f(t)}\\right) = ct\n$$\nTo solve for $f(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{1-f_0}{1-f(t)} = \\exp(ct)\n$$\nNow, we algebraically isolate $f(t)$:\n$$\n1-f(t) = \\frac{1-f_0}{\\exp(ct)} = (1-f_0)\\exp(-ct)\n$$\n$$\nf(t) = 1 - (1-f_0)\\exp(-ct)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the void volume fraction as a function of time.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - (1 - f_0) \\exp(-ct)}\n$$", "id": "3559564"}, {"introduction": "Once voids exist and grow, they weaken the material.

This means that a superposed rigid body motion should not affect the material's constitutive response, including the evolution of internal state variables like porosity.\n\nThe problem requires implementing two equivalent objective measures for $\\Delta \\epsilon_p^v$.\n\n**1. Logarithmic Strain from the Incremental Plastic Deformation Gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}$**\n\nIn finite deformation kinematics, the deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is updated multiplicatively. The plastic part follows $\\boldsymbol{F}_{p, n+1} = \\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}} \\boldsymbol{F}_{p, n}$. The incremental change in plastic volume is captured by the determinant of the incremental plastic deformation gradient, $J_p^{\\text{inc}} = \\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}})$. A robust and objective measure of volumetric strain is the logarithmic strain:\n$$\n\\Delta \\epsilon_p^v = \\ln(J_p^{\\text{inc}}) = \\ln(\\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}))\n$$\nThis measure is inherently objective. A superposed rigid body rotation $\\boldsymbol{R}$ transforms the deformation gradient to $\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}$. Since $\\boldsymbol{R}$ is a proper orthogonal tensor, its determinant is $\\det(\\boldsymbol{R}) = 1$. The new Jacobian is:\n$$\n\\det(\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}) = \\det(\\boldsymbol{R})\\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}) = 1 \\cdot J_p^{\\text{inc}} = J_p^{\\text{inc}}\n$$\nThe Jacobian, and thus $\\Delta \\epsilon_p^v$ and the resulting $f_{n+1}$, are invariant under such transformations. This confirms the objectivity of the formulation.\n\nFor an isochoric (volume-preserving) plastic increment, $\\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}) = 1$, which gives $\\Delta \\epsilon_p^v = \\ln(1) = 0$. Consequently, $f_{n+1} = 1 - (1-f_n)\\exp(0) = f_n$, correctly showing no change in porosity.\n\n**2. Strain from Incremental Volume Change Ratio**\n\nThis approach starts from physically intuitive scalar quantities: the current plastic volume $V_n^p$ and the incremental plastic volume change $\\Delta V^p$. The relationship between the deformation gradient and volume change is $V_{n+1}^p = \\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}) V_n^p = J_p^{\\text{inc}} V_n^p$.\nThe incremental change is defined as $\\Delta V^p = V_{n+1}^p - V_n^p$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V^p}{V_n^p} = \\frac{V_{n+1}^p - V_n^p}{V_n^p} = \\frac{V_{n+1}^p}{V_n^p} - 1 = J_p^{\\text{inc}} - 1\n$$\nThis gives $J_p^{\\text{inc}} = 1 + \\Delta V^p / V_n^p$.\nSubstituting this into the logarithmic strain definition:\n$$\n\\Delta \\epsilon_p^v = \\ln(J_p^{\\text{inc}}) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta V^p}{V_n^p}\\right)\n$$\nSince volume is a scalar quantity, it is inherently frame-invariant. Thus, this formulation is also objective and is fully consistent with the first method.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation\n\nThe solution will be implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for linear algebra operations.\nTwo functions will be created as specified:\n- `update_porosity_log_strain(f_n, F_p_inc)`: This function computes $\\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}})$, calculates $\\Delta \\epsilon_p^v = \\ln(\\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}))$, and returns the updated porosity using the derived formula $f_{n+1} = 1 - (1-f_n)\\exp(-\\Delta \\epsilon_p^v)$.\n- `update_porosity_vol_ratio(f_n, V_n_p, delta_V_p)`: This function computes $\\Delta \\epsilon_p^v = \\ln(1 + \\Delta V^p / V_n^p)$ and returns the updated porosity using the same formula.\n\nFor the invariance checks, a rotation matrix $\\boldsymbol{R}$ for a rotation about the $z$-axis by an angle $\\theta$ is constructed:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_z(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  -\\sin\\theta  0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe porosity update will be computed for an unrotated deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}$ and a rotated one $\\boldsymbol{R}_z(\\theta)\\boldsymbol{F}_p^{\\text{inc}}$. The results will be compared to demonstrate invariance within a specified numerical tolerance, $\\tau = 10^{-12}$.\nThe test cases provided will be systematically evaluated using these functions to generate the final output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef update_porosity_log_strain(f_n: float, F_p_inc: np.ndarray) - float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Updates porosity based on a logarithmic volumetric measure from the\n    incremental plastic deformation gradient.\n    \n    Args:\n        f_n: Initial porosity at step n.\n        F_p_inc: Incremental plastic deformation gradient (3x3 numpy array).\n    \n    Returns:\n        Updated porosity f_{n+1}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Jacobian of the incremental plastic deformation gradient\n    J_p_inc = np.linalg.det(F_p_inc)\n    \n    # The incremental plastic volumetric strain is the natural logarithm of the Jacobian.\n    # This is an objective (frame-invariant) scalar measure.\n    delta_epsilon_p_v = np.log(J_p_inc)\n    \n    # Integrate the porosity evolution equation: df/dt = (1-f) * tr(D_p)\n    # This leads to the update formula: f_{n+1} = 1 - (1-f_n)*exp(-delta_epsilon_p_v)\n    f_np1 = 1.0 - (1.0 - f_n) * np.exp(-delta_epsilon_p_v)\n    \n    return f_np1\n\ndef update_porosity_vol_ratio(f_n: float, V_n_p: float, delta_V_p: float) - float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Updates porosity based on the ratio of incremental plastic volume change\n    to the current plastic volume.\n    \n    Args:\n        f_n: Initial porosity at step n.\n        V_n_p: Current plastic volume.\n        delta_V_p: Incremental change in plastic volume.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Updated porosity f_{n+1}.\n    \"\"\"\n    if V_n_p = 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Current plastic volume V_n_p must be positive.\")\n    if V_n_p + delta_V_p = 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Resulting plastic volume must be positive.\")\n        \n    # The Jacobian is equivalent to the ratio of new volume to old volume.\n    # J_p_inc = V_{n+1}^p / V_n^p = (V_n^p + delta_V_p) / V_n^p = 1 + delta_V_p / V_n^p\n    # Volumes are scalars and inherently objective.\n    J_p_inc = 1.0 + delta_V_p / V_n_p\n    \n    # The incremental plastic volumetric strain\n    delta_epsilon_p_v = np.log(J_p_inc)\n    \n    # Same update formula as the other method\n    f_np1 = 1.0 - (1.0 - f_n) * np.exp(-delta_epsilon_p_v)\n    \n    return f_np1\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs the test suite for porosity updates and frame invariance checks.\n    \"\"\"\n    results = []\n    \n    # --- Test Case 1 ---\n    # Logarithmic-volumetric method, no rotation\n    f_n1 = 0.02\n    F_p_inc1 = np.diag([1.02, 1.01, 0.98])\n    r1 = update_porosity_log_strain(f_n1, F_p_inc1)\n    results.append(r1)\n    \n    # --- Test Case 2 ---\n    # Logarithmic-volumetric method, rotation invariance check\n    theta2 = 0.75  # radians\n    c, s = np.cos(theta2), np.sin(theta2)\n    R2 = np.array([[c, -s, 0.0], [s, c, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]])\n    F_p_inc2_rot = R2 @ F_p_inc1\n    f_np1_rot2 = update_porosity_log_strain(f_n1, F_p_inc2_rot)\n    \n    tolerance = 1e-12\n    r2 = np.abs(f_np1_rot2 - r1)  tolerance\n    results.append(r2)\n\n    # --- Test Case 3 ---\n    # Logarithmic-volumetric method, isochoric plastic increment\n    f_n3 = 0.05\n    val = 1.0 / (1.1 * 0.9)\n    F_p_inc3 = np.diag([1.1, 0.9, val])\n    r3 = update_porosity_log_strain(f_n3, F_p_inc3)\n    results.append(r3)\n\n    # --- Test Case 4 ---\n    # Incremental volume method, plastic dilatation\n    f_n4 = 0.01\n    V_n_p4 = 1.00\n    delta_V_p4 = 0.05\n    r4 = update_porosity_vol_ratio(f_n4, V_n_p4, delta_V_p4)\n    results.append(r4)\n\n    # --- Test Case 5 ---\n    # Incremental volume method, plastic compaction\n    f_n5 = 0.03\n    V_n_p5 = 1.00\n    delta_V_p5 = -0.02\n    r5 = update_porosity_vol_ratio(f_n5, V_n_p5, delta_V_p5)\n    results.append(r5)\n\n    # --- Test Case 6 ---\n    # Logarithmic-volumetric method, second rotation invariance check\n    f_n6 = 0.025\n    F_p_inc6 = np.diag([1.05, 1.00, 0.97])\n    \n    f_np1_unrot6 = update_porosity_log_strain(f_n6, F_p_inc6)\n    \n    theta6 = np.pi / 3.0  # radians\n    c, s = np.cos(theta6), np.sin(theta6)\n    R6 = np.array([[c, -s, 0.0], [s, c, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]])\n    F_p_inc6_rot = R6 @ F_p_inc6\n    f_np1_rot6 = update_porosity_log_strain(f_n6, F_p_inc6_rot)\n    \n    r6 = np.abs(f_np1_rot6 - f_np1_unrot6)  tolerance\n    results.append(r6)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # str(bool) gives 'True'/'False', which is acceptable for boolean representation.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3559591"}]}
