## Introduction
The First Law of Thermodynamics, a statement of the conservation of energy, is a foundational pillar of physics and engineering. In the advanced field of [computational solid mechanics](@entry_id:169583), it transcends being a mere background principle to become an active, indispensable tool for modeling the complex behavior of materials under coupled thermal and mechanical loads. While elementary mechanics often treats deformation and temperature as separate phenomena, the First Law provides the rigorous mathematical framework that inextricably links them, addressing the critical need to understand and predict the performance of materials in realistic, multiphysics environments.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of the balance of energy tailored for [computational solid mechanics](@entry_id:169583). In the first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** we will derive the [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) from first principles in both spatial and material descriptions, establishing the key equations that underpin thermomechanical analysis. Following this, the chapter **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** will demonstrate the law's far-reaching impact, from explaining material properties and predicting fracture to enabling the simulation of complex multiphysics systems like batteries and magnetic materials. Finally, **"Hands-On Practices"** will connect theory to application, illustrating how the [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) is used as a powerful verification tool to ensure the physical fidelity of numerical simulations.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy, a principle of paramount importance in physics and engineering. In the context of [computational solid mechanics](@entry_id:169583), this law governs the interplay between mechanical work, heat transfer, and the internal state of a deforming body. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and mechanisms of [energy balance](@entry_id:150831), starting from the general formulation for a continuum and progressively specializing it to forms that are directly applicable to the development and implementation of numerical models for complex thermomechanical phenomena.

### The First Law in the Spatial Description

We begin our analysis in the **spatial** or **Eulerian description**, where physical properties are observed at fixed points in space, $\boldsymbol{x}$, at time $t$. Consider a deforming body that occupies a material volume $\Omega(t)$ at time $t$. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the rate of change of the total energy of the body—comprising its internal energy $E_{\text{int}}$ and kinetic energy $K$—is equal to the sum of the power supplied by external forces and the net rate of heat transfer into the body.

The total energy is expressed as an integral over the current volume:
$$
E_{\text{total}} = K + E_{\text{int}} = \int_{\Omega(t)} \rho \left( \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} + e \right) \mathrm{d}v
$$
where $\rho$ is the current mass density, $\boldsymbol{v}$ is the velocity field, and $e$ is the specific internal energy (internal energy per unit mass).

The power of external forces includes work done by body forces $\boldsymbol{b}$ (per unit mass) acting on the volume and [surface tractions](@entry_id:169207) $\boldsymbol{t}$ acting on the boundary $\partial\Omega(t)$. The net heat transfer includes heat generated by internal sources $r$ (per unit mass) and heat conducted across the boundary, characterized by the heat flux vector $\boldsymbol{q}$. The integral form of the First Law is thus [@problem_id:3546394]:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int_{\Omega(t)} \rho \left( e + \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{v} \right) \mathrm{d}v = \int_{\partial\Omega(t)} \boldsymbol{t} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, \mathrm{d}a + \int_{\Omega(t)} \rho \boldsymbol{b} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, \mathrm{d}v - \int_{\partial\Omega(t)} \boldsymbol{q} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} \, \mathrm{d}a + \int_{\Omega(t)} \rho r \, \mathrm{d}v
$$
Here, $\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward unit normal to the boundary $\partial\Omega(t)$, and the negative sign on the heat [flux integral](@entry_id:138365) reflects the convention that $\boldsymbol{q}$ represents heat flowing *out* of the volume.

#### Partition of Mechanical Power

A crucial step in isolating the evolution of internal energy is to understand the destination of the [mechanical power](@entry_id:163535) supplied to the body. The total external [mechanical power](@entry_id:163535), $P_{\text{ext}}$, is given by:
$$
P_{\text{ext}} = \int_{\partial\Omega(t)} \boldsymbol{t} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, \mathrm{d}a + \int_{\Omega(t)} \rho \boldsymbol{b} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, \mathrm{d}v
$$
Using Cauchy's relation $\boldsymbol{t} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}\boldsymbol{n}$, where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the symmetric Cauchy stress tensor, and applying the divergence theorem, the surface integral can be converted to a volume integral. This leads to what is known as the **theorem of power expended**. This theorem states that the external [mechanical power](@entry_id:163535) is partitioned into two parts: the rate of change of the body's total kinetic energy, $\dot{K}$, and the power expended by internal stresses, known as the **[stress power](@entry_id:182907)**, $P_{\text{int}}$ [@problem_id:3546394].
$$
P_{\text{ext}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int_{\Omega(t)} \frac{1}{2} \rho \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, \mathrm{d}v + \int_{\Omega(t)} \boldsymbol{\sigma} : \mathbf{d} \, \mathrm{d}v = \dot{K} + P_{\text{int}}
$$
Here, $\mathbf{d} = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\boldsymbol{v} + (\nabla\boldsymbol{v})^{\top})$ is the **[rate-of-deformation tensor](@entry_id:184787)**, the symmetric part of the [spatial velocity gradient](@entry_id:187198) $\mathbf{L} = \nabla\boldsymbol{v}$. The term $\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{d}$ represents the [stress power](@entry_id:182907) per unit current volume. It is important to note that only the symmetric part of the [velocity gradient](@entry_id:261686), $\mathbf{d}$, contributes to the [stress power](@entry_id:182907), because the [double dot product](@entry_id:748648) of the symmetric stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ with the skew-symmetric [spin tensor](@entry_id:187346) $\mathbf{W} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{L} - \mathbf{L}^{\top})$ is identically zero. Physically, this means that only deformation, not [rigid-body rotation](@entry_id:268623), generates internal work.

#### The Local Balance of Internal Energy

By substituting the partition of [mechanical power](@entry_id:163535) back into the First Law and recognizing that the rate of change of kinetic energy $\dot{K}$ is balanced by a portion of the external power, we can derive a balance law solely for the internal energy. Subtracting the [mechanical energy](@entry_id:162989) balance from the total [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) yields the integral form for internal energy:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int_{\Omega(t)} \rho e \, \mathrm{d}v = \int_{\Omega(t)} \boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{d} \, \mathrm{d}v - \int_{\partial\Omega(t)} \boldsymbol{q} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} \, \mathrm{d}a + \int_{\Omega(t)} \rho r \, \mathrm{d}v
$$
This equation is fundamental: it states that the rate of change of a body's total internal energy is equal to the power of internal stresses, plus the net rate of heat transfer. Notably, the power of the [body forces](@entry_id:174230), $\rho \boldsymbol{b} \cdot \boldsymbol{v}$, does not appear in this equation, as its effect is accounted for in the kinetic energy balance [@problem_id:3546394].

Using the Reynolds [transport theorem](@entry_id:176504) and the [divergence theorem](@entry_id:145271), this integral statement can be localized to any point within the continuum, yielding the local (differential) form of the internal energy balance:
$$
\rho \dot{e} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{d} - \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{q} + \rho r
$$
where the superposed dot on $e$ denotes the **[material time derivative](@entry_id:190892)**. This equation is a cornerstone of continuum [thermomechanics](@entry_id:180251). It expresses that at any material point, the rate of increase of internal energy density is the sum of three source terms: the stress [power density](@entry_id:194407), $\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{d}$; the convergence of the heat flux, $-\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{q}$; and the volumetric heat supply, $\rho r$.

To make this concrete, consider a body occupying a domain $\Omega_t$ for which the stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{x})$, [rate-of-deformation tensor](@entry_id:184787) $\mathbf{d}(\boldsymbol{x})$, heat flux vector $\boldsymbol{q}(\boldsymbol{x})$, and volumetric heat source $r(\boldsymbol{x})$ are known at a particular instant. The instantaneous total rate of change of internal energy for the entire body can be calculated by integrating these local source terms over the volume [@problem_id:3546187] [@problem_id:3546265]:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}E_{\text{int}}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \int_{\Omega_t} \left( \boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{d} - \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{q} + \rho r \right) \mathrm{d}v
$$
This form is particularly useful in numerical methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM), where these integrals are evaluated over each element to assemble the global system of equations governing the thermomechanical response.

### The Energy Balance in the Material Description

While the spatial description is intuitive, most formulations in [solid mechanics](@entry_id:164042), particularly for finite deformations, are cast in the **material** or **Lagrangian description**. In this framework, all quantities are expressed in terms of the material coordinates $\mathbf{X}$ in a fixed, undeformed **reference configuration** $\Omega_0$. This requires transforming the [energy balance equation](@entry_id:191484) from the current configuration to the reference configuration.

The transformation relies on kinematic relations, notably the **[deformation gradient](@entry_id:163749)** $\mathbf{F} = \nabla_{\mathbf{X}}\boldsymbol{x}$ and its determinant, the Jacobian $J = \det \mathbf{F}$. The principle of conservation of mass provides the link between reference density $\rho_0$ and [current density](@entry_id:190690) $\rho$ via $\rho_0 = J\rho$.

By systematically transforming each term in the local [energy balance](@entry_id:150831), we arrive at the material form. The key is to identify pairs of [stress and strain](@entry_id:137374)-rate measures that are **energetically conjugate**, meaning their inner product correctly represents power density. The [stress power](@entry_id:182907) per unit reference volume, $P_{\text{int}}$, can be expressed in several equivalent ways [@problem_id:3546221] [@problem_id:3546242]:
$$
P_{\text{int}} = J(\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{d}) = \boldsymbol{P}:\dot{\mathbf{F}} = \boldsymbol{S}:\dot{\mathbf{E}} = \boldsymbol{\tau}:\mathbf{d}
$$
Here, $\mathbf{P} = J\boldsymbol{\sigma}\mathbf{F}^{-\top}$ is the nonsymmetric **first Piola-Kirchhoff (PK1) stress tensor**, $\mathbf{S} = J\mathbf{F}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\sigma}\mathbf{F}^{-\top} = \mathbf{F}^{-1}\mathbf{P}$ is the symmetric **second Piola-Kirchhoff (PK2) stress tensor**, $\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{F}^\top\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{I})$ is the **Green-Lagrange strain tensor**, and $\boldsymbol{\tau} = J\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the **Kirchhoff stress tensor**. The pairs $(\mathbf{P}, \dot{\mathbf{F}})$, $(\mathbf{S}, \dot{\mathbf{E}})$, and $(\boldsymbol{\tau}, \mathbf{d})$ are all [energetically conjugate pairs](@entry_id:748968) whose product gives the [stress power](@entry_id:182907) per unit *reference* volume. The fact that [stress power](@entry_id:182907) vanishes for any [rigid-body motion](@entry_id:265795), where $\mathbf{d}=\boldsymbol{0}$, is a fundamental property captured by these expressions [@problem_id:3546221].

Similarly, the heat flux term is transformed. The **referential heat [flux vector](@entry_id:273577)** $\mathbf{Q}$ is defined via a **Piola transformation** of the spatial heat [flux vector](@entry_id:273577) $\mathbf{q}$ such that the total heat flow through corresponding material and spatial surfaces is identical. This transformation is given by [@problem_id:3546242]:
$$
\mathbf{Q} = J \mathbf{F}^{-1} \mathbf{q}
$$
Using this definition, the heat flux divergence term becomes $-\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{q} \rightarrow -\frac{1}{J}\mathrm{Div}\,\mathbf{Q}$, where $\mathrm{Div}$ is the [divergence operator](@entry_id:265975) with respect to the material coordinates $\mathbf{X}$.

Assembling these pieces, the local energy balance per unit reference volume becomes:
$$
\rho_0 \dot{e} = \mathbf{P}:\dot{\mathbf{F}} - \mathrm{Div}\,\mathbf{Q} + \rho_0 r
$$
This equation is the direct counterpart to the spatial form and serves as the starting point for developing Lagrangian finite element formulations for [coupled thermomechanical problems](@entry_id:186655).

### Thermodynamic Framework and Dissipation

The First Law provides a balance, but it does not by itself specify how the material behaves. To do so, we must introduce a constitutive framework, which is governed by both the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. A powerful approach is to use **[thermodynamic potentials](@entry_id:140516)**, such as the **Helmholtz free energy** $\psi$ (per unit mass) or $\Psi$ (per unit volume).

The Helmholtz free energy is defined via a Legendre transformation of the internal energy with respect to entropy $s$ and temperature $T$:
$$
\psi = e - Ts
$$
Taking the [material time derivative](@entry_id:190892) gives $\dot{\psi} = \dot{e} - \dot{T}s - T\dot{s}$. By substituting the expression for $\dot{e}$ (or $\dot{U}$ per unit reference volume, as in [@problem_id:3546264]) from the First Law into this relation, we can re-express the energy balance in terms of the free energy rate. For instance, in the material description, we find:
$$
\rho_0 \dot{\Psi} = \mathbf{P}:\dot{\mathbf{F}} - \mathrm{Div}\,\mathbf{Q} + \rho_0 r - \rho_0 S \dot{T} - \rho_0 T \dot{S}
$$
where $\Psi$ and $S$ are the free energy and entropy per unit reference volume, respectively.

This formulation is pivotal because it leads directly to the **Clausius-Duhem inequality**, the [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125) expression of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. By combining the [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) with the [constitutive relations](@entry_id:186508) for a material (e.g., a thermo-visco-plastic solid), we can derive an expression for the local rate of [entropy production](@entry_id:141771), $\xi$. The Second Law requires that $\xi \ge 0$ for any physically admissible process. The derivation [@problem_id:3546355] reveals that the [entropy production](@entry_id:141771) is composed of two non-negative contributions: one from [mechanical dissipation](@entry_id:169843) and one from [heat conduction](@entry_id:143509).
$$
\xi = \frac{1}{T} (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\text{diss}} : \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_{\text{inel}}) - \frac{1}{T^2} (\mathbf{q} \cdot \nabla T) \ge 0
$$
Here, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\text{diss}}$ is the dissipative part of the stress (e.g., viscous or plastic stress) and $\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_{\text{inel}}$ is the corresponding inelastic [strain rate](@entry_id:154778). This inequality decomposes into two independent conditions that must be satisfied:
1.  **Intrinsic Dissipation:** $\mathcal{D}_{\text{mech}} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\text{diss}} : \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_{\text{inel}} \ge 0$. The power dissipated by inelastic mechanisms must be non-negative.
2.  **Thermal Dissipation:** $\mathcal{D}_{\text{th}} = -\mathbf{q} \cdot \nabla T \ge 0$. Heat must flow from hotter to colder regions.

This framework ensures that any proposed [constitutive model](@entry_id:747751) is thermodynamically consistent.

### Application: The Coupled Heat Equation in Solids

The principles discussed above come together in the formulation of the **transient heat equation** for a deforming solid. This equation governs the evolution of the temperature field $T(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ and is essential for simulating thermomechanical processes.

To derive it, we return to the local internal [energy balance](@entry_id:150831), $\rho \dot{e} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{d} - \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{q} + \rho r$. We then introduce specific constitutive assumptions [@problem_id:3546272]:
1.  The internal energy is primarily a function of temperature, $e \approx cT$, where $c$ is the [specific heat capacity](@entry_id:142129). This gives $\rho \dot{e} \approx \rho c \dot{T}$.
2.  Heat conduction is governed by **Fourier's Law**: $\mathbf{q} = -\mathbf{k} \nabla T$, where $\mathbf{k}$ is the thermal [conductivity tensor](@entry_id:155827). This implies $-\nabla\cdot\mathbf{q} = \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{k}\nabla T)$.
3.  The [stress power](@entry_id:182907) $\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{d}$ is partitioned into a reversible, elastically stored part and an irreversible, dissipated part $\mathcal{D}_{\text{mech}}$. This dissipation acts as an internal heat source. The efficiency of this conversion is often modeled using the **Taylor-Quinney factor**, $\chi \in [0, 1]$, which represents the fraction of plastic work converted instantaneously into heat.

Combining these elements, we find that the rate of change of thermal energy is balanced by heat conduction and the total heat source, which includes both external sources and internal dissipation:
$$
\rho c \dot{T} = \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{k} \nabla T) + \rho r + \chi \mathcal{D}_{\text{mech}}
$$
where $\mathcal{D}_{\text{mech}} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}:\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}_p$ for a rate-independent plastic material, or $\mathcal{D}_{\text{mech}} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\text{v}}:\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}$ for a viscous material. This is the coupled heat equation. Its solution requires appropriate boundary conditions, such as prescribed temperature (Dirichlet), prescribed heat flux (Neumann), or convective heat exchange (Robin) [@problem_id:3546272].

As a practical illustration, consider a one-dimensional viscoplastic material point under adiabatic conditions (no heat exchange with its surroundings) [@problem_id:3546232]. The First Law simplifies to $\rho c \dot{T} = \chi (\sigma \dot{\varepsilon}_p)$. Here, the rate of temperature increase is directly proportional to the plastic power dissipation $\sigma \dot{\varepsilon}_p$. To find $\dot{T}$, one must first use the material's [constitutive laws](@entry_id:178936) to calculate the current stress $\sigma$ and the resulting plastic strain rate $\dot{\varepsilon}_p$. This calculation demonstrates the direct coupling: mechanical loading induces [plastic flow](@entry_id:201346), which dissipates energy as heat, causing the material's temperature to rise. This temperature change, in turn, can affect the material's mechanical properties (e.g., yield strength), creating a fully coupled thermomechanical feedback loop that is central to many advanced engineering simulations.
