A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe process begins by calculating the deformation gradient, $\\mathbf{F}$, from the given deformation mapping. The deformation mapping is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{X}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector of a point in the deformed configuration, $\\mathbf{X}$ is its position vector in the reference configuration, and $\\mathbf{Q}$ is a constant proper orthogonal tensor ($\\mathbf{Q} \\in SO(3)$).\n\nThe deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}$ is defined as the gradient of the deformation mapping with respect to the material coordinates $\\mathbf{X}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\mathbf{X}} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{X}}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nIn component form, with indices $i$ and $j$ ranging from $1$ to $3$, we have $x_i = Q_{ij}X_j$. The components of the deformation gradient are $F_{ik} = \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial X_k}$.\n$$\nF_{ik} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_k} (Q_{ij}X_j)\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{Q}$ is a constant matrix, its components $Q_{ij}$ are not functions of $\\mathbf{X}$. Therefore, we can take them out of the differentiation:\n$$\nF_{ik} = Q_{ij} \\frac{\\partial X_j}{\\partial X_k}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\partial X_j}{\\partial X_k}$ is equal to the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{jk}$.\n$$\nF_{ik} = Q_{ij} \\delta_{jk} = Q_{ik}\n$$\nThus, in direct tensor notation, the deformation gradient is simply the rotation tensor itself:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{Q}\n$$\nNext, we compute the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{C}$, which is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\top}\\mathbf{F}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{Q}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{Q}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\mathbf{Q}$ belongs to the special orthogonal group, $SO(3)$. A defining property of any orthogonal matrix (and thus any special orthogonal matrix) is that its transpose is its inverse, which implies $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity tensor.\nTherefore, the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is the identity tensor:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we find the three principal invariants ($I_{1}$, $I_{2}$, $I_{3}$) of $\\mathbf{C}$. For any $3 \\times 3$ tensor $\\mathbf{A}$, the invariants are given by:\n$$\nI_{1}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A})\n$$\n$$\nI_{2}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A}))^2 - \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A}^2) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nI_{3}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\det(\\mathbf{A})\n$$\nWe apply these definitions to $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{I}$.\n\nThe first invariant, $I_{1}$, is the trace of $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$\nI_{1} = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{I}) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nThe second invariant, $I_{2}$, requires $\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{C}^2)$. Since $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{I}$, we have $\\mathbf{C}^2 = \\mathbf{I}^2 = \\mathbf{I}$.\n$$\n\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{C}^2) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{I}) = 3\n$$\nSubstituting into the formula for $I_{2}$:\n$$\nI_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{I}))^2 - \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{I}^2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 3^2 - 3 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} (9 - 3) = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n$$\nThe third invariant, $I_{3}$, is the determinant of $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$\nI_{3} = \\det(\\mathbf{I}) = 1\n$$\nSo, the triple of invariants is $(I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3}) = (3, 3, 1)$.\n\nFinally, we must justify whether this motion produces any strain. Objective, rotation-invariant strain measures are formulated based on stretch tensors, such as $\\mathbf{C}$. The Green-Lagrange strain tensor, $\\mathbf{E}$, is a fundamental objective strain measure defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{I})\n$$\nFor the given deformation, we found that $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{I}$. Substituting this into the definition of $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{I}) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{0}) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{0}$ is the zero tensor. Since the Green-Lagrange strain tensor is identically zero, this motion produces no strain. This is consistent with the physical interpretation of the mapping $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{X}$ as a pure rigid body rotation, which preserves distances and angles between all points in the continuum, and thus by definition involves no deformation or strain.

For an undeformed body, $\\gamma=0$ and $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=\\lambda_3=1$, so $I_1=3$. The term $\\gamma^2$ indicates that the simple shear deformation induces a change in the lengths of material line elements. Since $\\gamma^2 \\geq 0$, the sum of the squared stretches is always greater than or equal to its value in the undeformed state, indicating a net stretching of the material element, even though the deformation is a shear.\n\n2.  **$I_2(\\mathbf{C}) = \\lambda_1^2 \\lambda_2^2 + \\lambda_2^2 \\lambda_3^2 + \\lambda_3^2 \\lambda_1^2 = 3 + \\gamma^2$**: This invariant relates to the change in material surface areas. Specifically, it is the sum of the squares of the area ratios for surfaces that were originally perpendicular to the principal axes. Similar to $I_1$, its value of $3 + \\gamma^2$ shows that the shearing motion distorts surface areas.\n\n3.  **$I_3(\\mathbf{C}) = \\det(\\mathbf{C}) = (\\det(\\mathbf{F}))^2 = J^2 = \\lambda_1^2 \\lambda_2^2 \\lambda_3^2 = 1$**: This invariant is the square of the Jacobian determinant $J$, which measures the ratio of the deformed volume to the undeformed volume. The result $I_3=1$ means that $J=1$, signifying that the deformation is **isochoric**, or volume-preserving. This is a fundamental characteristic of simple shear: the material element is distorted in shape, but its total volume remains unchanged.\n\nIn summary, the simple shear deformation, despite preserving volume ($I_3=1$), causes distortion that changes lengths and areas, as captured by the fact that $I_1$ and $I_2$ deviate from their undeformed value of $3$ by an amount proportional to $\\gamma^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 + \\gamma^{2} & 3 + \\gamma^{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3575349"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice connects the invariants directly to their most fundamental physical interpretation: the principal stretches.

All terms are standard and defined unambiguously, allowing for a direct and unique derivation of the requested quantities.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the definitions provided. First, we compute the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, $C$. The deformation gradient, $F$, is given as a diagonal matrix:\n$$F = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_{3} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe transpose of $F$, denoted $F^{\\top}$, is identical to $F$ since $F$ is a symmetric matrix. Thus, $C$ is calculated as:\n$$C = F^{\\top} F = F F = F^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_{2}^{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_{3}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe principal invariants $I_{1}$, $I_{2}$, and $I_{3}$ are defined as the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial $p(\\mu) = \\det(\\mu I - C)$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity tensor. We construct the matrix $\\mu I - C$:\n$$\\mu I - C = \\mu \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_{2}^{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_{3}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu - \\lambda_{1}^{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\mu - \\lambda_{2}^{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu - \\lambda_{3}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of this diagonal matrix is the product of its diagonal elements:\n$$p(\\mu) = \\det(\\mu I - C) = (\\mu - \\lambda_{1}^{2})(\\mu - \\lambda_{2}^{2})(\\mu - \\lambda_{3}^{2})$$\nExpanding this product yields the polynomial in $\\mu$:\n$$p(\\mu) = (\\mu^{2} - (\\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2})\\mu + \\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2})(\\mu - \\lambda_{3}^{2})$$\n$$p(\\mu) = \\mu^{3} - \\lambda_{3}^{2}\\mu^{2} - (\\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2})\\mu^{2} + (\\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2})\\lambda_{3}^{2}\\mu + \\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2}\\mu - \\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2}\\lambda_{3}^{2}$$\nCollecting terms with like powers of $\\mu$:\n$$p(\\mu) = \\mu^{3} - (\\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2})\\mu^{2} + (\\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2}\\lambda_{3}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2}\\lambda_{1}^{2})\\mu - (\\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2}\\lambda_{3}^{2})$$\nBy comparing this derived polynomial with the given form $p(\\mu) = \\mu^{3} - I_{1}\\mu^{2} + I_{2}\\mu - I_{3}$, we can identify the expressions for the principal invariants by matching the coefficients:\n$$I_{1} = \\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2}$$\n$$I_{2} = \\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2}\\lambda_{3}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2}\\lambda_{1}^{2}$$\n$$I_{3} = \\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2}\\lambda_{3}^{2}$$\nIn general, for a symmetric tensor, $I_{1}$ is its trace, $I_{3}$ is its determinant, and $I_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}((\\operatorname{tr}(C))^{2} - \\operatorname{tr}(C^{2}))$.

The Jacobian of the deformation, $J = \\det F$, represents the ratio of a differential volume element in the deformed configuration to its counterpart in the reference configuration. For the given $F$, we have:\n$$J = \\det F = \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3}$$\nThe third invariant, $I_{3}$, can be expressed in terms of $J$:\n$$I_{3} = \\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2}\\lambda_{3}^{2} = (\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3})^{2} = J^{2}$$\nThis shows that $I_{3}$ is a direct measure of the square of the volume change. A deformation is isochoric (volume-preserving) if $J=1$, which implies $I_{3}=1$. Therefore, $I_{3}$ exclusively encodes volumetric deformation.\n\nTo analyze the distortional (shape-changing) aspect of the deformation, we consider the isochoric right Cauchy–Green tensor, $\\bar{C} = J^{-2/3}C$.

The invariants $\\bar{I}_{1}$ and $\\bar{I}_{2}$ are functions of the stretch ratios, modified to be independent of the overall volume change. They are pure measures of distortion. The original invariants $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are related to these distortional invariants by factors of $J^{2/3}$ and $J^{4/3}$ respectively. This demonstrates that $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ contain coupled information about both volumetric change (via $J$) and distortional change (via $\\bar{I}_{1}$ and $\\bar{I}_{2}$), whereas $I_{3}$ isolates the volumetric effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2} & \\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2}\\lambda_{3}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2}\\lambda_{1}^{2} & \\lambda_{1}^{2}\\lambda_{2}^{2}\\lambda_{3}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3575388"}]}
