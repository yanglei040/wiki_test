The process is to start from fundamental principles as specified.\n\nThe discrete system consists of $N$ point masses $m_i$ located at positions $x_i$, for $i=1, \\dots, N$. The linear mass density of such a system can be represented using the Dirac delta distribution $\\delta(\\cdot)$ as a singular distribution, which we denote $\\rho_{\\text{discrete}}(x)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{discrete}}(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \\delta(x-x_{i})\n$$\nThis representation is a sum of distributions, each weighted by the mass $m_i$ and centered at the position $x_i$.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis in this context implies smoothing this singular distribution to obtain a regular, continuous field $\\rho(x)$. This process is called regularization or coarse-graining. The problem states this is achieved by using a normalized Gaussian mollifier, $W_{h}(y)$. The mathematical operation for this smoothing is convolution. The coarse-grained density $\\rho(x)$ is the convolution of the discrete density $\\rho_{\\text{discrete}}(x)$ and the kernel $W_h(x)$, denoted by $(\\rho_{\\text{discrete}} * W_h)(x)$.\n\nThe definition of the convolution of a distribution $f(y)$ with a smooth function $g(y)$ is given by:\n$$\n(f * g)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(y) \\, g(x-y) \\, dy\n$$\nApplying this definition to our problem, we have $f(y) = \\rho_{\\text{discrete}}(y)$ and $g(y) = W_h(y)$. Therefore, the coarse-grained density is:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = (\\rho_{\\text{discrete}} * W_h)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho_{\\text{discrete}}(y) \\, W_h(x-y) \\, dy\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho_{\\text{discrete}}(y)$:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \\delta(y-x_{i}) \\right) W_h(x-y) \\, dy\n$$\nSince the integral of a finite sum is the sum of the integrals, we can exchange the order of summation and integration:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} m_{i} \\delta(y-x_{i}) W_h(x-y) \\, dy\n$$\nThe masses $m_i$ are constants with respect to the integration variable $y$, so they can be factored out of the integrals:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(y-x_{i}) W_h(x-y) \\, dy\n$$\nWe now use the fundamental sifting property of the Dirac delta distribution, which states that for any suitable test function $\\phi(y)$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(y-a) \\phi(y) \\, dy = \\phi(a)\n$$\nIn our integral, the distribution is $\\delta(y-x_i)$ and the test function is $\\phi(y) = W_h(x-y)$. Applying the sifting property, the integral evaluates to the test function at $y=x_i$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(y-x_{i}) W_h(x-y) \\, dy = W_h(x-x_{i})\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\rho(x)$ yields the final derived formula for the coarse-grained linear mass density:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} W_h(x-x_{i})\n$$\nThe problem states that $W_h(y)$ is a normalized kernel, which means $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} W_h(y) dy = 1$.

The total incremental stored energy, $\\mathcal{E}$, over a domain of length $L$ and unit cross-sectional area is given by the integral of $W$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}[\\gamma] = \\int_{L} W(\\gamma, \\partial_x \\gamma) \\, dx = \\int_{L} \\left( \\tfrac{1}{2} G_{t} \\gamma^{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2} C \\, \\ell^{2} \\left( \\partial_x \\gamma \\right)^{2} \\right) dx\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma(x)$ is the shear strain field, $G_t$ is the tangent shear modulus, $C$ is the gradient stiffness, and $\\ell$ is the internal length scale.\n\nThe principle of virtual work states that the first variation of the total energy, $\\delta \\mathcal{E}$, must vanish for any kinematically admissible virtual strain field $\\delta\\gamma(x)$ for the system to be in equilibrium.\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{E} = \\int_{L} \\left( \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\gamma} \\delta\\gamma + \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial(\\partial_x \\gamma)} \\delta(\\partial_x \\gamma) \\right) dx = 0\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives of $W$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\gamma} = G_{t} \\gamma\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial(\\partial_x \\gamma)} = C \\, \\ell^{2} (\\partial_x \\gamma)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the variational statement gives:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{E} = \\int_{L} \\left( G_{t} \\gamma \\delta\\gamma + C \\, \\ell^{2} (\\partial_x \\gamma) (\\partial_x \\delta\\gamma) \\right) dx = 0\n$$\nTo handle the derivative on the virtual strain, $\\partial_x \\delta\\gamma$, we integrate the second term by parts:\n$$\n\\int_{L} C \\, \\ell^{2} (\\partial_x \\gamma) (\\partial_x \\delta\\gamma) \\, dx = \\left[ C \\, \\ell^{2} (\\partial_x \\gamma) \\delta\\gamma \\right]_{L} - \\int_{L} C \\, \\ell^{2} (\\partial_{xx} \\gamma) \\delta\\gamma \\, dx\n$$\nAssuming the boundary terms vanish (e.g., due to periodic boundary conditions or prescribed strains such that $\\delta\\gamma=0$ at the boundaries), the variational statement becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{L} \\left( G_{t} \\gamma - C \\, \\ell^{2} \\partial_{xx} \\gamma \\right) \\delta\\gamma \\, dx = 0\n$$\nAccording to the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations, since this equation must hold for any arbitrary virtual strain field $\\delta\\gamma(x)$, the integrand in the parentheses must be zero. This yields the governing differential equation for the strain field $\\gamma(x)$:\n$$\nG_{t} \\gamma(x) - C \\, \\ell^{2} \\partial_{xx} \\gamma(x) = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n$$\n\\partial_{xx} \\gamma(x) - \\frac{G_{t}}{C \\ell^{2}} \\gamma(x) = 0\n$$\nTo perform a linear stability analysis, we investigate the possibility of non-trivial solutions to this linear differential equation. We use a harmonic perturbation ansatz of the form:\n$$\n\\gamma(x) = A \\exp(ikx)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is an amplitude and $k$ is the wave number. The derivatives are $\\partial_x \\gamma = ik\\gamma$ and $\\partial_{xx} \\gamma = -k^2 \\gamma$. Substituting the second derivative into the governing equation gives:\n$$\n-k^2 \\gamma(x) - \\frac{G_{t}}{C \\ell^{2}} \\gamma(x) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution (where $\\gamma(x) \\neq 0$), the following characteristic equation must be satisfied:\n$$\nk^2 = -\\frac{G_{t}}{C \\ell^{2}}\n$$\nA linear stability analysis seeks the conditions under which a homogeneous state can bifurcate into a patterned state. In this static context, this corresponds to the emergence of a solution with a real-valued wave number $k$. This requires $k^2 > 0$. Given that $C > 0$ and $\\ell > 0$, the condition for instability becomes $G_t < 0$. The problem states that in the softening regime, $G_t = G - h < 0$, where $h > G$. This condition is met.\n\nThe neutral stability condition defines the wave number $k$ of the emerging localization mode at the onset of instability. solving for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\sqrt{-\\frac{G_{t}}{C \\ell^{2}}} = \\sqrt{-\\frac{G-h}{C \\ell^{2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{h-G}{C \\ell^{2}}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the shear band thickness, $t_{\\mathrm{sb}}$, as the half-wavelength of this neutral mode. The wavelength $\\lambda$ is related to the wave number $k$ by $\\lambda = 2\\pi / k$.\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sb}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{k} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sb}} = \\pi \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{h-G}{C \\ell^{2}}} \\right)^{-1} = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{C \\ell^{2}}{h-G}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the shear band thickness:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sb}} = \\pi \\ell \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{h - G}}\n$$\n\nRegarding the question of mesh independence in a Finite Element Method (FEM) discretization:\nIn a classical, local continuum model (where $\\ell = 0$), the governing equation in the softening regime is ill-posed. Numerical solutions of such problems exhibit pathological mesh dependence: the width of the computed strain localization zone shrinks with mesh refinement, converging to a physically unrealistic solution of zero thickness. The numerical result is dictated by the discretization size, not by any physical property of the material.\n\nThe gradient-regularized model used here circumvents this issue. The inclusion of the strain gradient term, characterized by the internal length scale $\\ell$, regularizes the governing equations. As derived above, this formulation predicts a shear band of a specific thickness, $t_{\\mathrm{sb}}$, which is a function of intrinsic material parameters $(\\ell, C, G, h)$. This thickness is therefore a material property. A correctly implemented FEM simulation of this gradient model, using a mesh fine enough to resolve the strain profile within the band (i.e., element size significantly smaller than $t_{\\mathrm{sb}}$), will produce a solution where the shear band thickness converges to this analytically predicted, material-intrinsic value. The result is thus objective and independent of the computational mesh size, which is a critical requirement for a physically meaningful predictive model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi \\ell \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{h - G}}}\n$$", "id": "3605877"}]}
