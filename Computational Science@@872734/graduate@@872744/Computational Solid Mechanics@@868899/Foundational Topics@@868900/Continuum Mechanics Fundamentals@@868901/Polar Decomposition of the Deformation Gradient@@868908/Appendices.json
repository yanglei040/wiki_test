From the SVD, the polar decomposition factors can be identified as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R} = \\mathcal{U} \\mathcal{V}^\\top \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\boldsymbol{U} = \\mathcal{V} \\Sigma \\mathcal{V}^\\top\n$$\nThe Jacobian $J$ can be expressed as $J = \\det(\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\det(\\mathcal{U}) \\det(\\Sigma) \\det(\\mathcal{V}^\\top) = \\det(\\mathcal{U}\\mathcal{V}^\\top)\\det(\\Sigma) = \\det(\\boldsymbol{R}) \\prod \\sigma_i$. Since all $\\sigma_i \\ge 0$, the sign of $J$ is determined by the sign of $\\det(\\boldsymbol{R})$.\n- If $J > 0$, then $\\det(\\boldsymbol{R}) = +1$, and $\\boldsymbol{R}$ is a proper rotation, an element of the special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\n- If $J  0$, then $\\det(\\boldsymbol{R}) = -1$, and $\\boldsymbol{R}$ is an improper rotation (a reflection-rotation).\n- If $J = 0$, at least one $\\sigma_i=0$ and $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is singular.\n\nThe problem requires a principled repair algorithm that finds the nearest mapping in $\\mathrm{GL}^+(3)$ by minimally altering the stretch. This implies preserving the stretch tensor $\\boldsymbol{U}$ (which captures the physically meaningful deformation magnitude) and projecting the rotational part $\\boldsymbol{R}$ onto $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$. Given $\\boldsymbol{R}$ with $\\det(\\boldsymbol{R}) = -1$, the closest matrix $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\text{proj}} \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ in the Frobenius norm sense is sought. This is a classic orthogonal Procrustes problem.\n\nThe solution is found by modifying the SVD factors of $\\boldsymbol{F}$. If $\\det(\\boldsymbol{R}) = \\det(\\mathcal{U}\\mathcal{V}^\\top) = -1$, we can construct a new orthogonal matrix $\\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}}$ by flipping the sign of one of its columns, say the last one.\n$$\n\\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}} = \\mathcal{U} \\cdot \\mathrm{diag}(1, 1, -1)\n$$\nThis ensures that $\\det(\\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}}) = -\\det(\\mathcal{U})$, and consequently $\\det(\\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}}\\mathcal{V}^\\top) = -\\det(\\mathcal{U}\\mathcal{V}^\\top) = +1$. The projected rotation is then $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\text{proj}} = \\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}} \\mathcal{V}^\\top$.\n\nSince we must preserve the stretch tensor $\\boldsymbol{U} = \\mathcal{V} \\Sigma \\mathcal{V}^\\top$, the repaired deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}}$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}} = \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\text{proj}} \\boldsymbol{U} = (\\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}} \\mathcal{V}^\\top) (\\mathcal{V} \\Sigma \\mathcal{V}^\\top) = \\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}} \\Sigma \\mathcal{V}^\\top\n$$\nThis provides a simple and robust algorithm:\n1.  Compute the SVD of the approximate deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{approx}} = \\mathcal{U} \\Sigma \\mathcal{V}^\\top$.\n2.  Check if a repair is needed by computing $J_{\\text{approx}} = \\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{approx}})$. If $J_{\\text{approx}} > 0$, no repair is needed, and $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}} = \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{approx}}$.\n3.  If $J_{\\text{approx}} \\le 0$, construct the projected matrix $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}} = \\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}} \\Sigma \\mathcal{V}^\\top$, where $\\mathcal{U}_{\\text{proj}}$ is $\\mathcal{U}$ with the sign of its last column flipped. This ensures $\\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}}) > 0$ (unless $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{approx}}$ was singular, in which case $\\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}}) = 0$).\n\nWe will apply this procedure to the three given test cases. First, we construct the ground-truth deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{true}}$ with $\\theta = 0.3$ radians, $\\lambda_1 = 1.15$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.90$, and $\\lambda_3 = 1.05$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_z(0.3) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(0.3)  -\\sin(0.3)  0 \\\\ \\sin(0.3)  \\cos(0.3)  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\Lambda = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.15  0  0 \\\\ 0  0.90  0 \\\\ 0  0  1.05 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{true}} = \\boldsymbol{R}_z(0.3) \\Lambda\n$$\nThen, we construct the three approximate tensors $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{approx}}^{(i)}$ for $i=1,2,3$ as specified. For each case, we compute the following quantities:\n1.  $J_{\\text{approx}}^{(i)} = \\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{approx}}^{(i)})$.\n2.  The repaired deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}}^{(i)}$ using the SVD-based projection.\n3.  $J_{\\text{proj}}^{(i)} = \\det(\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}}^{(i)})$.\n4.  The Frobenius-norm error before repair: $e_{\\text{before}}^{(i)} = \\|\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{approx}}^{(i)} - \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{true}}\\|_F$.\n5.  The Frobenius-norm error after repair: $e_{\\text{after}}^{(i)} = \\|\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}}^{(i)} - \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{true}}\\|_F$.\n6.  The energy gap after repair, $\\Delta W^{(i)} = W(\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{proj}}^{(i)}) - W(\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{true}})$, using the compressible Neo-Hookean strain-energy density function with material parameters $\\mu = 40$ and $\\lambda = 80$:\n$$\nW(\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\left(\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{F}^\\top \\boldsymbol{F}) - 3\\right) - \\mu \\ln(\\det(\\boldsymbol{F})) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} (\\ln(\\det(\\boldsymbol{F})))^2\n$$\nThe results for each test case will be collected and formatted as specified.", "answer": "[[1.0833216893976313,1.0833216893976313,0.014285657143194095,0.014285657143194095,0.730248473852084],[-1.0911765878226495,1.0911765878226495,2.100196886026903,0.001648332501099687,1.1583569145694297],[-0.02181513222879598,0.02181513222879598,1.0710705668383328,0.001186423200926593,293.4247072522735]]", "id": "3589220"}]}
