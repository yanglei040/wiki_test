The relationship is given by Cramer's rule: $C = J (F^{-1})^T$. In index notation, this is $C_{pQ} = J F^{-1}_{Qp}$.

A standard route to ensure objectivity is to express $W$ in terms of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor $C_{ij} = F_{ki} F_{kj}$. \n\nA common pitfall when using index notation is to drop the Einstein summation on repeated indices and inadvertently turn a scalar contraction into a componentwise product. To expose the danger, consider the following deliberately faulty derivation. Starting from a quadratic form $W(F_{ij})$ that, when properly contracted, would produce a scalar, suppose one carelessly rewrites $F_{ij} F_{ij}$ without summation and then, to extract a “scalar,” keeps only the $(i,j)=(1,2)$ component, thereby defining the non-objective quantity $\\widetilde{W}(F_{ij}) = \\tfrac{\\mu}{2}\\,F_{12} F_{12}$, where $\\mu0$ is a constant. \n\nConstruct a concrete counterexample demonstrating that $\\widetilde{W}$ violates objectivity, and then fix the construction by introducing $C_{ij} = F_{ki} F_{kj}$.

Using the Einstein summation convention, this is written as:\n$$ F'_{ij} = R_{ik} F_{kj} $$\nWe are asked to compute the component $(RF)_{12}$, which is $F'_{12}$.

We have already calculated the first term. We now calculate the second term, $\\widetilde{W}(F)$, for the original deformation:\n$$ \\widetilde{W}(F) = \\frac{\\mu}{2} F_{12} F_{12} $$\nSince the initial deformation $F_{ij}$ is a pure stretch, its off-diagonal components are zero. In particular, $F_{12} = 0$. Therefore:\n$$ \\widetilde{W}(F) = \\frac{\\mu}{2} (0)^2 = 0 $$\nThe energy shift is then:\n$$ \\Delta \\widetilde{W}(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\lambda_2^2 \\sin^2(\\theta) \\right) - 0 = \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\lambda_2^2 \\sin^2(\\theta) $$\nThis expression quantifies the non-objective change in the faulty \"energy\" due to a pure rotation.

The right Cauchy–Green tensor $C_{ij} = F_{ki} F_{kj}$ is the basis for such quantities. Let's demonstrate that the tensor $C_{ij}$ itself is objective.\n\nLet $F'_{ij} = R_{ik} F_{kj}$ be the rotated deformation gradient. The corresponding right Cauchy–Green tensor, let's call it $C'_{ab}$, is given by:\n$$ C'_{ab} = F'_{ka} F'_{kb} $$\nSubstitute the expression for $F'_{ij}$:\n$$ C'_{ab} = (R_{kc} F_{ca}) (R_{kd} F_{db}) $$\nwhere $c$ and $d$ are new dummy indices for summation. We can rearrange the terms since they are scalars:\n$$ C'_{ab} = (R_{kc} R_{kd}) (F_{ca} F_{db}) $$\nThe term $R_{kc} R_{kd}$ involves a summation over the repeated index $k$. This corresponds to the matrix product $R^T R$. The components of the transpose tensor $(R^T)$ are $(R^T)_{ck} = R_{kc}$. So, the expression is the $(c,d)$ component of $R^T R$:\n$$ R_{kc} R_{kd} = (R^T)_{ck} R_{kd} = (R^T R)_{cd} $$\nBecause $R_{ij}$ is an orthogonal tensor, we have $R^T R = I$, where $I$ is the identity tensor. In index notation, this is $(R^T R)_{cd} = \\delta_{cd}$. Therefore:\n$$ R_{kc} R_{kd} = \\delta_{cd} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $C'_{ab}$:\n$$ C'_{ab} = \\delta_{cd} (F_{ca} F_{db}) $$\nThe Kronecker delta $\\delta_{cd}$ is $1$ if $c=d$ and $0$ otherwise. The summation over $c$ (or $d$) collapses, contracting $c$ to $d$:\n$$ C'_{ab} = F_{da} F_{db} $$\nThis expression, $F_{da} F_{db}$, is exactly the definition of the original right Cauchy–Green tensor $C_{ab} = F_{ka} F_{kb}$ (with the dummy index just named $d$ instead of $k$). Thus, we have shown that:\n$$ C'_{ab} = C_{ab} $$\nThe right Cauchy–Green tensor is itself invariant under the superposed rotation. Consequently, any scalar function of $C_{ij}$ will also be objective.\n\nThe problem specifically asks to show this for the first invariant, $I_1 = C_{ii}$. For the original deformation $F$, this is $I_1(F) = C_{ii} = F_{ki} F_{ki}$. For the rotated deformation $F'$, this is $I_1(RF) = C'_{ii} = F'_{ki} F'_{ki}$. Using our intermediate result $C'_{ij} = C_{ij}$, it immediately follows that $C'_{ii} = C_{ii}$, and therefore $I_1(RF) = I_1(F)$.\n\nThis completes the demonstration. The use of a proper tensorial contraction, as in the definition of $C_{ij}$, ensures that the resulting quantity is a proper scalar or tensor that transforms correctly under coordinate system changes, and in this case, a particular scalar invariant of $C_{ij}$ is shown to be objective. The faulty function $\\widetilde{W}$ failed because it arbitrarily selected a single component, $F_{12}$, whose value is not preserved under rotations.\n\nThe final answer required is the expression for $\\Delta \\widetilde{W}(\\theta)$ derived in Part 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\mu}{2} \\lambda_2^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}$$", "id": "3574098"}, {"introduction": "In computational mechanics, abstract higher-order tensors are often replaced by more efficient matrix representations.

It is derived from a naive component-by-component transcription of the stress-strain law $\\mathbf{s} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{C}} \\mathbf{e}_{\\text{tensorial}}$, where $\\mathbf{e}_{\\text{tensorial}}$ uses tensorial strains. A common mistake is to confuse the coefficients of such a matrix with the components of the underlying tensor. For shear terms, the matrix coefficient is $\\tilde{C}_{66} = 2\\mu = 160\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, but the corresponding tensor component is $C_{1212} = \\mu = 80\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$. The factor of 2 arises from the summation of two equal terms ($C_{1212}\\varepsilon_{12}$ and $C_{1221}\\varepsilon_{21}$) in the tensor expansion, a crucial detail lost in the naive matrix representation.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of the Scalar Contraction**\n\nWe need to evaluate $S = C_{ijkl}A_{ij}B_{kl}$ with $\\lambda = 120\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\mu = 80\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, for the given symmetric tensors $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$.\n$$\nS = \\left[ \\lambda \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} + \\mu (\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}) \\right] A_{ij}B_{kl}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\lambda (\\delta_{ij}A_{ij})(\\delta_{kl}B_{kl}) + \\mu (A_{ij}B_{kl}\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + A_{ij}B_{kl}\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})\n$$\nWe evaluate the contractions:\n- $\\delta_{ij}A_{ij} = A_{ii} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A})$\n- $\\delta_{kl}B_{kl} = B_{kk} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{B})$\n- $A_{ij}B_{kl}\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} = A_{kj}B_{kl} = A_{ij}B_{ij} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{B})$\n- $A_{ij}B_{kl}\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk} = A_{lj}B_{jl} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})$\n\nSince $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are symmetric, $\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}=\\mathbf{A}$, so $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{B}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})$. The expression for $S$ becomes:\n$$\nS = \\lambda \\, \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A})\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{B}) + 2\\mu \\, \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical values:\n- $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}) = 0.0010 - 0.0003 + 0.0001 = 0.0008$.\n- $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{B}) = -0.0007 + 0.0009 + 0.0005 = 0.0007$.\n- $\\lambda \\, \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A})\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{B}) = 120 \\times (0.0008) \\times (0.0007) = 6.72 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\n- For symmetric tensors, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}) = \\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}B_{ij}$.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}B_{ij} =  (0.0010)(-0.0007) + (0.0002)(0.0006) + (-0.0005)(0.0002) \\\\\n + (0.0002)(0.0006) + (-0.0003)(0.0009) + (0.0004)(-0.0003) \\\\\n + (-0.0005)(0.0002) + (0.0004)(-0.0003) + (0.0001)(0.0005) \\\\\n=  (-7.0 + 1.2 - 1.0 + 1.2 - 2.7 - 1.2 - 1.0 - 1.2 + 0.5) \\times 10^{-7} \\\\\n=  -11.2 \\times 10^{-7} = -1.12 \\times 10^{-6}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n- $2\\mu \\, \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}) = 2 \\times 80 \\times (-1.12 \\times 10^{-6}) = 160 \\times (-1.12 \\times 10^{-6}) = -1.792 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFinally, summing the two parts:\n$S = 6.72 \\times 10^{-5} - 1.792 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.0000672 - 0.0001792 = -0.000112\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $-0.0001120\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1.120 \\times 10^{-4}}$$", "id": "3574049"}]}
