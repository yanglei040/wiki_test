Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks to compute the divergence of a second-order tensor field $T(\\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where $T$ is defined by the dyadic product of the position vector $\\mathbf{x}$ with itself.\n\nThe position vector in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates is given by $\\mathbf{x}$, with components $x_i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nThe tensor field is defined as $T(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x} \\otimes \\mathbf{x}$. In component form, using the provided definition of the dyadic product, the components of the tensor $T$ are given by:\n$$T_{ij} = x_i x_j$$\n\nThe divergence of a second-order tensor field $T$ is a vector field, whose $i$-th component is defined as:\n$$(\\nabla \\cdot T)_i = \\frac{\\partial T_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}$$\nHere, the repeated index $j$ implies summation over $j = 1, 2, 3$ according to the Einstein summation convention.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the components $T_{ij}$ into the definition of the divergence, we get:\n$$(\\nabla \\cdot T)_i = \\frac{\\partial (x_i x_j)}{\\partial x_j}$$\n\nWe must now apply the product rule for partial differentiation to the term $(x_i x_j)$. The variables $x_i$ and $x_j$ are both functions of the spatial coordinates, so we have:\n$$\\frac{\\partial (x_i x_j)}{\\partial x_j} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial x_j}\\right) x_j + x_i \\left(\\frac{\\partial x_j}{\\partial x_j}\\right)$$\n\nIn a Cartesian coordinate system, the components of the position vector $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ are independent variables. Therefore, the partial derivative of one component with respect to another is given by the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial x_j} = \\delta_{ij}$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij} = 1$ if $i = j$ and $\\delta_{ij} = 0$ if $i \\neq j$.\n\nSubstituting this identity into our expression, we obtain:\n$$(\\nabla \\cdot T)_i = (\\delta_{ij}) x_j + x_i (\\delta_{jj})$$\n\nNow we evaluate each term separately, remembering that summation over repeated indices is implied.\n\nFor the first term, $(\\delta_{ij}) x_j$, the summation is over the index $j$. The property of the Kronecker delta is that it \"sifts\" the sum, meaning $\\sum_{j} \\delta_{ij} x_j$ is only non-zero when $j=i$. This operation effectively replaces the index $j$ with $i$:\n$$(\\delta_{ij}) x_j \\equiv \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} x_j = \\delta_{i1}x_1 + \\delta_{i2}x_2 + \\delta_{i3}x_3 = x_i$$\n\nFor the second term, $x_i (\\delta_{jj})$, the summation is over the index $j$. This summation is the trace of the Kronecker delta tensor, which is the dimension of the space. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$:\n$$\\delta_{jj} \\equiv \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{jj} = \\delta_{11} + \\delta_{22} + \\delta_{33} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$\nThe second term thus simplifies to:\n$$x_i (\\delta_{jj}) = x_i (3) = 3x_i$$\n\nCombining the two simplified terms, we find the $i$-th component of the resulting vector field:\n$$(\\nabla \\cdot T)_i = x_i + 3x_i = 4x_i$$\n\nSince this holds for each component $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the components of the vector $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{x} \\otimes \\mathbf{x})$ are $(4x_1, 4x_2, 4x_3)$. This is equivalent to $4$ times the original position vector $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nTherefore, the final result, expressed as a vector field in terms of $\\mathbf{x}$, is:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{x} \\otimes \\mathbf{x}) = 4\\mathbf{x}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\mathbf{x}}$$", "id": "3597664"}, {"introduction": "Physical laws must not depend on the observer's frame of reference; this is a cornerstone of physics known as the principle of objectivity or material frame-indifference.
