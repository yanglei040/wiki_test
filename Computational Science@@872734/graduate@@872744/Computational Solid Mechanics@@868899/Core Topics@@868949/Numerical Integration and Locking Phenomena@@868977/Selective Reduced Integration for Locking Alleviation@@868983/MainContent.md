## Introduction
In the application of the Finite Element Method (FEM) to solid and structural mechanics, achieving accurate and reliable results is paramount. However, a significant numerical challenge known as **locking** often arises, causing models to behave with an artificial and non-physical stiffness. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent when analyzing [nearly incompressible materials](@entry_id:752388) or thin structures, leading to a gross underestimation of displacements and stresses, and ultimately, a failure of the simulation. This article addresses this critical problem by providing a comprehensive overview of **Selective Reduced Integration (SRI)**, a robust and widely-used technique to alleviate locking.

This guide is structured to build a complete understanding of SRI, from fundamental theory to practical application. The journey begins in the **Principles and Mechanisms** chapter, which deconstructs the nature of volumetric and [shear locking](@entry_id:164115), explains how SRI works by selectively applying different numerical quadrature rules, and discusses the critical side-effect of hourglass instability. Following this, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter demonstrates the versatility of SRI, showcasing its use beyond linear elasticity to solve problems in [nonlinear mechanics](@entry_id:178303), [hyperelasticity](@entry_id:168357), [viscoelasticity](@entry_id:148045), and multiphysics simulations. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers a curated set of exercises designed to translate theoretical knowledge into practical coding and analytical skills, solidifying your ability to implement and critically evaluate the method. By navigating these sections, you will gain the expertise needed to effectively diagnose and resolve locking in your own computational mechanics work.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the application of the displacement-based Finite Element Method (FEM) to solid mechanics, a critical challenge arises when the constitutive behavior of the material or the kinematic assumptions of a structural theory impose constraints on the deformation field. When a standard [finite element discretization](@entry_id:193156) is unable to properly represent these constraints, a numerical [pathology](@entry_id:193640) known as **locking** can occur. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles behind locking phenomena and details the mechanisms of a widely used remedy: Selective Reduced Integration (SRI).

### The Nature of Kinematic Locking

Locking is an artificial stiffening of the finite element model that leads to a gross underestimation of displacements and stresses. It is not a property of the material being modeled, nor is it a [numerical stability](@entry_id:146550) issue in the sense of matrix ill-conditioning. Rather, locking is an **approximation failure** that stems from an incompatibility between the kinematic capabilities of the chosen finite element interpolation and the constraints imposed by the underlying physical theory. [@problem_id:3599205]

Consider the [weak form](@entry_id:137295) of the linear elasticity problem, which seeks a [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) $\boldsymbol{u}$ such that for all admissible virtual displacements $\boldsymbol{v}$:
$$
a(\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v}) = \ell(\boldsymbol{v})
$$
Here, $\ell(\boldsymbol{v})$ is the [virtual work](@entry_id:176403) of external loads, and the [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) $a(\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v})$ represents the [internal virtual work](@entry_id:172278). For [isotropic linear elasticity](@entry_id:185899), this bilinear form can be decomposed based on the volumetric (dilatational) and deviatoric (distortional) responses of the material. The strain tensor $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ is split into its volumetric and deviatoric parts:
$$
\boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{vol}} = \left(\boldsymbol{\epsilon} - \frac{1}{d}(\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{\epsilon})\boldsymbol{I}\right) + \frac{1}{d}(\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{\epsilon})\boldsymbol{I}
$$
where $d$ is the spatial dimension, $\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}$ is the volumetric strain, and $\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity tensor. This decomposition allows the [strain energy density](@entry_id:200085) $W(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})$ to be written as the sum of deviatoric and volumetric energies:
$$
W(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}) = \mu(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}} : \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}}) + \frac{1}{2} K (\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{\epsilon})^{2}
$$
Here, $\mu$ is the [shear modulus](@entry_id:167228) and $K$ is the [bulk modulus](@entry_id:160069). The corresponding [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) is:
$$
a(\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v}) = \int_{\Omega} 2\mu\, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}}(\boldsymbol{u}):\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}}(\boldsymbol{v})\,\mathrm{d}\Omega + \int_{\Omega} K\, (\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u})(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v})\,\mathrm{d}\Omega
$$
Locking occurs when a large parameter multiplies one of these energy terms, effectively turning it into a penalty term that enforces a kinematic constraint. If the finite element space $V_h$ is not sufficiently rich to satisfy this constraint without suppressing physically correct deformation modes, the model locks. We will examine two principal forms of this phenomenon: [volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606) and [shear locking](@entry_id:164115). [@problem_id:3599180] [@problem_id:3599205]

### Volumetric Locking in Nearly Incompressible Materials

Volumetric locking is prevalent in the analysis of [nearly incompressible materials](@entry_id:752388), such as rubber or certain biological tissues, where the Poisson's ratio $\nu$ approaches $0.5$. This limit corresponds to the bulk modulus $K$ becoming much larger than the shear modulus $\mu$ (i.e., $K \gg \mu$). [@problem_id:3599180]

As $K \to \infty$, for the total [strain energy](@entry_id:162699) to remain finite, the solution must satisfy the incompressibility constraint $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0$. In a discrete setting, the FEM formulation attempts to enforce this constraint at the integration points used for [numerical quadrature](@entry_id:136578) of the [element stiffness matrix](@entry_id:139369). With a standard "full" integration scheme, this can lead to an over-constrained system.

Let us consider a two-dimensional domain discretized with four-node bilinear quadrilateral ($Q_1$ or $Q_4$) elements. The displacement field within each element is bilinear. The divergence of this [displacement field](@entry_id:141476), $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}_h$, is a linear function of the [local coordinates](@entry_id:181200) $(\xi, \eta)$, meaning it has three independent parameters (e.g., $A + B\xi + C\eta$). If we use a full $2 \times 2$ Gaussian quadrature rule, we are evaluating the volumetric energy term at four distinct integration points. As $K$ becomes very large, the numerical scheme tries to enforce $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}_h = 0$ at all four of these points. However, a non-zero linear function cannot be zero at four distinct points. The only way to satisfy these four constraints is for the function to be identically zero, i.e., $A=B=C=0$. This forces $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}_h \equiv 0$ throughout the element in a manner that is too strong, preventing valid deformation modes (like bending, which requires small, non-zero volume changes) and causing the element to become artificially rigid. This is the essence of volumetric locking. [@problem_id:3599145]

### Shear Locking in Slender Structural Elements

An analogous phenomenon, **[shear locking](@entry_id:164115)**, occurs in the analysis of slender structures like beams and plates when using theories that account for [transverse shear deformation](@entry_id:176673), such as the Timoshenko [beam theory](@entry_id:176426). [@problem_id:3599205]

In Timoshenko beam theory, the kinematics are described by the transverse displacement $w(x)$ and the independent cross-section rotation $\theta(x)$. The transverse shear strain is given by the difference between the slope of the beam's centerline and the rotation of the cross-section:
$$
\gamma = \frac{dw}{dx} - \theta
$$
The beam's strain energy contains a bending component (proportional to $EI(\frac{d\theta}{dx})^2$) and a shear component (proportional to $\kappa GA\gamma^2$). For a very thin beam (thickness $t \ll L$), the shear stiffness $\kappa GA$ is much larger than the [bending stiffness](@entry_id:180453) $EI$, and the physics dictates that the shear strain must approach zero, i.e., $\gamma \to 0$. This is the Euler-Bernoulli kinematic constraint, $\frac{dw}{dx} = \theta$. [@problem_id:3599204]

If we discretize a Timoshenko beam using a simple two-node element with linear interpolations for both $w$ and $\theta$, the slope $\frac{dw}{dx}$ becomes constant within the element, while the rotation $\theta$ is linear. To satisfy the constraint $\gamma = 0$ everywhere in the element, the linear function $\theta(x)$ would have to be equal to the constant $\frac{dw}{dx}$, which severely restricts the element's ability to bend and leads to a spuriously stiff response. This is [shear locking](@entry_id:164115). [@problem_id:3599204]

### The Remedy: Selective Reduced Integration (SRI)

A robust and computationally efficient remedy for locking is **Selective Reduced Integration (SRI)**. The principle is to apply a lower-order numerical quadrature rule *selectively* to the energy term that causes locking, while retaining a higher-order, "full" quadrature for the well-behaved terms. [@problem_id:3599200]

For **volumetric locking**, the strategy is to under-integrate the volumetric energy term (the one scaled by $K$) and fully integrate the deviatoric term (scaled by $\mu$). Returning to our $Q_1$ [quadrilateral element](@entry_id:170172), if we use a single integration point (1-point quadrature) for the volumetric term, we impose the constraint $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}_h = 0$ only at the element's center. A single constraint is easily satisfied by the three-parameter linear divergence field without locking the element. Meanwhile, the deviatoric energy is still integrated with the full $2 \times 2$ rule to accurately capture the element's shear response. [@problem_id:3599151] [@problem_id:3599200]

For **[shear locking](@entry_id:164115)** in the two-node Timoshenko [beam element](@entry_id:177035), the same logic applies. We under-integrate the shear energy term (e.g., using a 1-point rule) and fully integrate the bending energy term (e.g., using a 2-point rule). This weakens the shear constraint, enforcing $\gamma=0$ only in an average sense (at the element center), which is sufficient to prevent locking and allows the element to bend correctly. [@problem_id:3599204]

### A Critical Side-Effect: Hourglass Instability

While [reduced integration](@entry_id:167949) is key to SRI, its indiscriminate use can introduce a different numerical [pathology](@entry_id:193640): **[hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855)**, also known as [spurious zero-energy modes](@entry_id:755267). These are non-physical, oscillatory deformation patterns of an element that, by happenstance, produce zero strain at the reduced integration points. [@problem_id:3599196]

The [element stiffness matrix](@entry_id:139369), $\boldsymbol{K}_e$, is computed by integrating the matrix product $\boldsymbol{B}^\top \boldsymbol{C} \boldsymbol{B}$, where $\boldsymbol{B}$ is the [strain-displacement matrix](@entry_id:163451). If this integral is approximated using too few points, the resulting discrete stiffness matrix $\boldsymbol{K}_e$ may become rank-deficient. Its [null space](@entry_id:151476) will contain vectors corresponding not only to the physical rigid-body modes (which have zero strain everywhere) but also to these non-rigid [hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855). Because these modes have zero strain energy ($\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{d}^\top \boldsymbol{K}_e \boldsymbol{d} = 0$), the element offers no resistance to them, leading to uncontrolled, mesh-dependent oscillations in the solution. [@problem_id:3599196]

A classic example is the 8-node trilinear hexahedral element. Its nodal displacement vector has $24$ degrees of freedom. If the entire stiffness matrix is computed using a single integration point, the rank of the matrix is determined by the rank of the $6 \times 24$ matrix $\boldsymbol{B}$ at the element center, which is $6$. By the [rank-nullity theorem](@entry_id:154441), the null space of the stiffness matrix has dimension $24 - 6 = 18$. Since there are only $6$ rigid-body modes in 3D, this leaves $18 - 6 = 12$ spurious [hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855). [@problem_id:3599196]

This is precisely why the *selective* nature of SRI is paramount. By applying [reduced integration](@entry_id:167949) *only* to the locking-prone term (e.g., volumetric) while retaining full integration for the stable term (e.g., deviatoric), we ensure that the overall [element stiffness matrix](@entry_id:139369) has the correct rank to resist non-physical deformations. The fully integrated part provides the necessary stability to suppress [hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855). [@problem_id:3599151]

### Theoretical Foundation: The Connection to Mixed Formulations

SRI, while seemingly a simple numerical "trick," possesses a deep theoretical justification rooted in [mixed variational principles](@entry_id:165106). Locking in a displacement-only formulation is intimately related to the stability of an equivalent [mixed formulation](@entry_id:171379).

An alternative approach to [near-incompressibility](@entry_id:752381) is the mixed displacement-pressure ($u-p$) formulation, where pressure is introduced as an independent field (a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the [incompressibility constraint](@entry_id:750592)). The stability of a discrete mixed method depends on the choice of finite element spaces for displacement, $V_h$, and pressure, $Q_h$. These spaces must satisfy the **Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB)** condition, also known as the **[inf-sup condition](@entry_id:174538)**:
$$
\inf_{q_h \in Q_h, \, q_h \neq 0} \; \sup_{v_h \in V_h, \, v_h \neq 0} \; \frac{\int_{\Omega} (\nabla \cdot v_h) \, q_h \, \mathrm{d}x}{\|\boldsymbol{v}_h\|_{H^1(\Omega)} \, \|q_h\|_{L^2(\Omega)}} \ge \beta > 0
$$
where $\beta$ is a constant independent of the mesh size. [@problem_id:3599213] This condition ensures that the discrete pressure space is not too large or "constraining" relative to the discrete displacement space. A failure of the LBB condition (e.g., for equal-order $Q_1-Q_1$ interpolations) manifests as spurious pressure oscillations and instability in the mixed method, and it is the direct analog of locking in the displacement-only formulation. [@problem_id:3599172] [@problem_id:3599213]

The power of SRI stems from the **Malkus–Hughes equivalence principle**: for many common elements, the displacement-only formulation with SRI is algebraically identical to a stable, LBB-compliant [mixed formulation](@entry_id:171379) in which the pressure degrees of freedom have been eliminated (statically condensed) at the element level. [@problem_id:3599213]

For example, the SRI scheme for a $Q_1$ element (1-point quadrature for the volumetric term) is equivalent to a stable $Q_1$-$P_0$ [mixed formulation](@entry_id:171379) (bilinear displacement, piecewise constant pressure) where the pressure variable has been analytically solved for and substituted back into the equations. This reveals that SRI is not an ad-hoc fix but rather a computationally efficient way to implement a stable mixed method. It implicitly uses a lower-order, stable approximation for the pressure-like variable. [@problem_id:3599172] This insight also connects SRI to other advanced techniques like the $\bar{B}$ method, which explicitly projects the [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252) onto a lower-order space, and provides a contrast to methods like Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS), which enrich the strain field directly through a modified variational principle.
