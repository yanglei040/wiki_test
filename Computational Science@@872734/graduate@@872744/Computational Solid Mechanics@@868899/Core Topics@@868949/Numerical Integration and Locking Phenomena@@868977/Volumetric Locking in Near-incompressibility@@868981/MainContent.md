## Introduction
Simulating the behavior of [nearly incompressible materials](@entry_id:752388), such as rubber, biological tissues, and saturated soils, is crucial across many fields of science and engineering. However, applying standard displacement-based [finite element methods](@entry_id:749389) to these materials often leads to a critical numerical failure known as [volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606), where the simulated model behaves orders of magnitude stiffer than reality, yielding grossly inaccurate results. This article directly addresses this challenge by providing a comprehensive theoretical and practical overview of [volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606).

We will begin in the first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** by exploring the continuum mechanics of [near-incompressibility](@entry_id:752381) and diagnosing the root cause of locking within the finite element framework. Next, in **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** we will examine the far-reaching consequences of this phenomenon in advanced areas like [computational dynamics](@entry_id:747610), [elastoplasticity](@entry_id:193198), and topology optimization, demonstrating the necessity of robust solutions. Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** chapter offers targeted exercises to translate theory into practical understanding. Through this structured approach, you will gain the expertise to identify, understand, and overcome volumetric locking in your own computational work.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles of near-incompressible elasticity and the mechanisms by which volumetric locking arises in standard numerical formulations. We will begin by establishing the continuum-level theory, proceed to diagnose the origins of numerical pathology in the [finite element method](@entry_id:136884), and conclude by introducing the foundational concepts behind several classes of remedies.

### The Continuum Mechanics of Near-Incompressibility

In the theory of [isotropic linear elasticity](@entry_id:185899), the mechanical response of a material is fully characterized by two independent constants. While various pairs of constants are used (e.g., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio), the most physically insightful decomposition separates the material's resistance to volume change from its resistance to shape change (shear). This is achieved through the **bulk modulus**, $K$, and the **[shear modulus](@entry_id:167228)**, $\mu$ (also denoted $G$).

The [kinematics of deformation](@entry_id:189142) are described by the [small-strain tensor](@entry_id:754968), $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \mathbf{u} + (\nabla \mathbf{u})^{T})$, where $\mathbf{u}$ is the displacement field. This tensor can be additively decomposed into its volumetric and deviatoric parts. The **[volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252)**, $\varepsilon_v$, represents the infinitesimal change in volume per unit volume and is defined as the trace of the strain tensor [@problem_id:3609944]:
$$
\varepsilon_v = \operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}
$$
The **[deviatoric strain](@entry_id:201263)** tensor, $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}}$, represents the isochoric (volume-preserving) part of the deformation and is defined as:
$$
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} - \frac{1}{3}\varepsilon_v \mathbf{I}
$$
where $\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. By construction, the [deviatoric strain](@entry_id:201263) tensor is traceless, i.e., $\operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}}) = 0$.

Similarly, the Cauchy stress tensor, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, can be decomposed into a **[hydrostatic stress](@entry_id:186327)** component, characterized by the pressure $p$, and a **deviatoric stress** tensor, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\text{dev}}$. The pressure is defined as the negative of the mean normal stress:
$$
p = -\frac{1}{3}\operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})
$$
The constitutive law for an isotropic linear elastic material can be expressed in a decoupled form that directly relates these corresponding parts [@problem_id:3609947]:
$$
p = -K \varepsilon_v
$$
$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\text{dev}} = 2\mu \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}}
$$
The total stress is then given by $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = -p\mathbf{I} + \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\text{dev}}$. This elegant split reveals that, at the continuum level, the volumetric response (pressure vs. volume change) is governed solely by the bulk modulus $K$, while the deviatoric response (shear stress vs. shear strain) is governed solely by the [shear modulus](@entry_id:167228) $\mu$. The [strain energy density](@entry_id:200085), $W$, also decouples additively:
$$
W(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}) = W_{\text{vol}}(\varepsilon_v) + W_{\text{dev}}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}}) = \frac{1}{2} K \varepsilon_v^2 + \mu (\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}})
$$

A material is considered **[nearly incompressible](@entry_id:752387)** when it is far more resistant to changes in volume than to changes in shape. This is quantified by the condition $K \gg \mu$. In the limit of perfect incompressibility, $K \to \infty$, which enforces the kinematic constraint $\varepsilon_v = 0$ for any finite pressure state. Common examples include rubber-like materials and biological tissues. In terms of the more classical Lamé parameters $(\lambda, \mu)$, the bulk modulus is given by $K = \lambda + \frac{2}{3}\mu$. Therefore, the condition $K \gg \mu$ is equivalent to $\lambda \gg \mu$. The Poisson's ratio, $\nu$, is related to the Lamé parameters by $\nu = \frac{\lambda}{2(\lambda+\mu)}$. As $\lambda \gg \mu$, it is straightforward to see that $\nu$ approaches its thermodynamic limit of $0.5$ [@problem_id:3609947].

In the context of **[finite strain](@entry_id:749398)** theory, the deformation is described by the deformation gradient $\mathbf{F} = \nabla_{\mathbf{X}} \boldsymbol{\chi}$, where $\boldsymbol{\chi}$ is the motion mapping points $\mathbf{X}$ from the reference configuration to the current configuration. The local change in volume is given by the Jacobian determinant, $J = \det(\mathbf{F})$. An isochoric (volume-preserving) motion implies that the density $\rho$ remains constant for each material particle, which, through the principle of mass conservation ($\rho J = \rho_0$), leads to the kinematic constraint $J=1$ [@problem_id:3609978]. Near-[incompressibility](@entry_id:274914) is therefore characterized by deformations for which $J \approx 1$. It is a common error to associate [near-incompressibility](@entry_id:752381) with $J \approx 0$, which would imply a near-total collapse of volume [@problem_id:3609944].

### The Numerical Pathology of Volumetric Locking

In a standard displacement-based [finite element formulation](@entry_id:164720), the potential energy of the system is minimized. The strain energy contribution, derived from the energy density $W$, contains the volumetric term $\frac{1}{2} K \varepsilon_v^2$. For a nearly [incompressible material](@entry_id:159741), the [bulk modulus](@entry_id:160069) $K$ is set to a very large value. This term thus acts as a **penalty term**, heavily penalizing any solution that results in a non-zero [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252). For the total energy to remain finite, the discrete solution $\mathbf{u}_h$ must satisfy $\varepsilon_v(\mathbf{u}_h) \approx 0$ throughout the domain.

While this appears to correctly model the physics, it often leads to a catastrophic numerical artifact known as **volumetric locking**. The discretized system behaves as if it were orders of magnitude stiffer than the actual material, yielding displacements that are erroneously small.

The fundamental cause of locking is a mismatch between the kinematic constraints imposed by the incompressibility condition and the limited [representational capacity](@entry_id:636759) of the [polynomial spaces](@entry_id:753582) used for the discrete displacement field $\mathbf{u}_h$. A simple one-dimensional analogue can provide intuition [@problem_id:3609939]. Consider an elastic bar with Young's modulus $E$, where an artificial penalty term $\frac{1}{2}\alpha(u')^2$ is added to the strain energy to penalize non-zero strain. The effective modulus becomes $E+\alpha$, and the tip displacement under a force $F$ becomes $u(L) = \frac{FL}{A(E+\alpha)}$. As the penalty parameter $\alpha \to \infty$, the displacement $u(L) \to 0$, regardless of the physical modulus $E$. The system "locks up" to satisfy the penalty.

In two or three dimensions, the mechanism is more subtle. Low-order elements, such as the 4-node bilinear quadrilateral ($Q_1$), have a very restricted space of strain fields that they can represent. Consider a $Q_1$ element, for which the [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) is bilinear. The resulting [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252), $\varepsilon_v = \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}$, is a linear function of the spatial coordinates $(x,y)$, belonging to a space of dimension 3. If we use a standard full [numerical integration](@entry_id:142553) scheme (e.g., $2 \times 2$ Gauss quadrature), we evaluate the strain energy at four distinct points within the element. As $K \to \infty$, the penalty term forces the volumetric strain to be near-zero at each of these four Gauss points. This imposes four independent constraints on a function that only has three degrees of freedom. The only way to satisfy this over-determined system is for the volumetric strain to be identically zero everywhere in the element. This nullifies valid deformation modes, such as bending, which require a linear (but not zero) [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252) field, thus making the element artificially rigid [@problem_id:3609968].

This mechanism is vividly illustrated by considering a single $Q_1$ element under a bending-like load with boundary conditions that prevent horizontal displacement. An analytical derivation shows that the vertical displacement of the loaded nodes is inversely proportional to a term involving the Lamé parameter $\lambda$, i.e., $v_3 = \frac{6P}{6\mu + \lambda}$. As the material approaches [incompressibility](@entry_id:274914) ($\lambda \to \infty$), the displacement $v_3 \to 0$, demonstrating a complete lock-up of the bending mode [@problem_id:3609987]. Similarly, the linear triangular element ($P_1$), which has a constant strain field, is also known to lock severely when assembled into a mesh, as the number of elemental constraints becomes comparable to the number of global degrees of freedom [@problem_id:3609968].

The severity of locking can also depend on the global configuration of the problem, particularly the applied **boundary conditions**. The [divergence theorem](@entry_id:145271) states that the total volume change of a body is equal to the net flux of displacement across its boundary: $\int_{\Omega} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \, d\Omega = \oint_{\Gamma} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, d\Gamma$. If the prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions impose a non-zero net flux, then a change in volume is kinematically enforced. For a nearly [incompressible material](@entry_id:159741), this leads to an unavoidable conflict. For instance, prescribing uniaxial compression while constraining the lateral boundaries with rollers enforces a net volume reduction, which will inevitably lead to locking in a low-order displacement-based formulation [@problem_id:3609954]. Conversely, if the boundary conditions permit an [isochoric deformation](@entry_id:196451) (e.g., simple shear, or [uniaxial tension](@entry_id:188287) with free lateral surfaces), locking may be less severe or absent. It is noteworthy that volumetric locking is not an issue in **[plane stress](@entry_id:172193)** problems, as the material is free to deform in the out-of-plane direction to maintain constant volume, effectively satisfying the [incompressibility constraint](@entry_id:750592) at no energy cost [@problem_id:3609944].

### Remedies for Volumetric Locking

To overcome volumetric locking, numerous advanced finite element formulations have been developed. These methods can be broadly categorized into three families: those that modify the integration rule, those that introduce additional field variables, and those that enhance the strain field itself.

#### Selective Reduced Integration (SRI)

The most direct approach to fixing the over-constraint issue is to reduce the number of constraints. **Selective reduced integration** achieves this by using a lower-order numerical quadrature rule for the volumetric part of the [strain energy](@entry_id:162699), while retaining full integration for the deviatoric part [@problem_id:3609968]. For the $Q_1$ element, this typically means evaluating the volumetric term $\frac{1}{2}K\varepsilon_v^2$ at a single Gauss point at the element center, while the deviatoric term $\mu(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}}:\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\text{dev}})$ is integrated using the full $2 \times 2$ rule. This reduces the number of volumetric constraints from four to one per element, which is no longer over-constraining and is sufficient to prevent spurious constant volume changes.

However, this method has a significant drawback: **[hourglassing](@entry_id:164538)**. By under-integrating the stiffness matrix, we may fail to penalize certain non-physical, oscillatory deformation modes. These **[hourglass modes](@entry_id:174855)** are nodal displacement patterns that produce zero strain at the single integration point and thus have zero strain energy, leading to a singular or near-singular [global stiffness matrix](@entry_id:138630) [@problem_id:3609964]. For SRI elements to be robust, they must be augmented with an **[hourglass control](@entry_id:163812)** or stabilization scheme, which adds a small amount of artificial stiffness to specifically penalize these [spurious modes](@entry_id:163321).

#### Mixed Formulations

A more robust and theoretically elegant solution is the use of **[mixed formulations](@entry_id:167436)**. In this approach, the pressure $p$ is introduced as an independent field variable alongside the displacement $\mathbf{u}$. The system of equations is derived from a [saddle-point problem](@entry_id:178398), typically based on the Hu-Washizu or Hellinger-Reissner variational principles. The resulting [weak form](@entry_id:137295) for a nearly [incompressible material](@entry_id:159741) consists of two coupled equations [@problem_id:3609951]:
1. A momentum balance equation involving both $\mathbf{u}$ and $p$.
2. A [constitutive equation](@entry_id:267976) that weakly enforces the relationship between pressure and [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252), e.g., $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{K}p = 0$.

The displacement $\mathbf{u}$ is sought in a space $V$ (typically $[H^1(\Omega)]^d$), and the pressure $p$ is sought in a space $Q$ (typically $L^2(\Omega)$). The stability and convergence of this mixed method depend crucially on the choice of discrete interpolation spaces, $V_h$ and $Q_h$. These spaces must satisfy the celebrated **Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi (LBB) condition**, also known as the [inf-sup condition](@entry_id:174538). This condition, formally stated as
$$
\inf_{0 \ne q_h \in Q_h} \sup_{0 \ne \mathbf{v}_h \in V_h} \frac{\int_{\Omega} q_h (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}_h) \, d\Omega}{\|\mathbf{v}_h\|_{V} \|q_h\|_{Q}} \ge \beta > 0
$$
for some constant $\beta$ independent of the mesh size, ensures that the discrete displacement space $V_h$ is sufficiently rich to control every mode in the discrete pressure space $Q_h$ [@problem_id:3609951, @problem_id:3609966].

Failure to satisfy the LBB condition leads to an unstable formulation, often manifesting as wild, non-physical oscillations in the pressure solution. A classic example of an unstable pair is the equal-order bilinear element ($Q_1-Q_1$), where both displacement and pressure are interpolated with bilinear shape functions. On quadrilateral meshes, the space of divergences of the $Q_1$ [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) does not include the full space of $Q_1$ pressure fields (it lacks the 'xy' mode), violating the LBB condition [@problem_id:3609966]. A stable and widely used alternative is the Taylor-Hood element ($Q_2-Q_1$), which uses biquadratic interpolation for displacement and [bilinear interpolation](@entry_id:170280) for pressure. The richer $Q_2$ displacement space is able to satisfy the LBB condition with the $Q_1$ pressure space.

#### Enhanced and Assumed Strain Methods

This third class of methods avoids introducing pressure as a global variable, instead modifying the element's internal kinematics to improve its behavior.

The **Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS)** method augments the [compatible strain field](@entry_id:747536) derived from the nodal displacements with an additional, "enhanced" strain field that is defined only within the element and parameterized by internal variables [@problem_id:3609943]. For the volumetric part, the strain is assumed to be of the form:
$$
\epsilon_v^h = \underbrace{\mathbf{B}_v \mathbf{u}_e}_{\text{compatible part}} + \underbrace{\epsilon_v^{\mathrm{EAS}}}_{\text{enhanced part}}
$$
To ensure consistency (i.e., that the element can exactly reproduce a constant strain state, passing the patch test), the enhanced strain field must be orthogonal to constant stress fields. This leads to the fundamental requirement that the enhanced strain modes must have a **[zero mean](@entry_id:271600)** over the element. A common choice is to construct these modes from "[bubble functions](@entry_id:176111)" that vanish on the element boundary. By enriching the space of representable volumetric strains, the element can better satisfy the [incompressibility constraint](@entry_id:750592) without locking.

For finite-strain [hyperelasticity](@entry_id:168357), a very successful related technique is the **$\bar{F}$ method** [@problem_id:3609961]. This method is based on the [multiplicative decomposition](@entry_id:199514) of the [deformation gradient](@entry_id:163749), $\mathbf{F} = J^{1/3}\tilde{\mathbf{F}}$. Instead of using the pointwise Jacobian $J$ in the volumetric part of the energy function $U(J)$, one uses a modified Jacobian $\bar{J}$, which is a projection of $J$ onto a lower-order space (e.g., piecewise constants on each element). A modified [deformation gradient](@entry_id:163749) is then constructed as $\bar{\mathbf{F}} = \bar{J}^{1/3} J^{-1/3} \mathbf{F}$. The strain energy is then evaluated based on this modified gradient, typically as $W_{\text{mod}} = \Psi(\tilde{\mathbf{F}}) + U(\bar{J})$. This has the effect of replacing the complex, pointwise volumetric constraint with a simpler, averaged one, thereby alleviating locking. The method has the advantages of passing the patch test and being objective (frame-invariant). However, for optimal performance in a Newton-Raphson solver, it requires the careful derivation of a [consistent algorithmic tangent](@entry_id:166068) matrix, accounting for the variation of both $J$ and its projection $\bar{J}$ [@problem_id:3609961].
