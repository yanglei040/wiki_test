The displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ at any point $(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta)$ within the element is interpolated from the nodal degrees of freedom ($q_e$). For a small-rotation formulation, this interpolation is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_n} N_i(\\xi, \\eta) \\left( \\mathbf{u}_i + \\frac{\\zeta t_i}{2} (\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i \\times \\mathbf{V}_{3,i}) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $N_i(\\xi, \\eta)$ are the two-dimensional shape functions on the mid-surface, $\\mathbf{u}_i = [u_{x,i}, u_{y,i}, u_{z,i}]^T$ is the translational displacement vector at node $i$, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i = [\\theta_{x,i}, \\theta_{y,i}, \\theta_{z,i}]^T$ is the rotation vector at node $i$, and $\\mathbf{V}_{3,i}$ is the initial director vector at node $i$, which is normal to the shell's mid-surface.\n\nLet us define a local coordinate system at node $i$ such that $\\mathbf{V}_{3,i}$ aligns with the local $z$-axis, i.e., $\\mathbf{V}_{3,i} = [0, 0, 1]^T$. The cross product becomes:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i \\times \\mathbf{V}_{3,i} =\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_{x,i} \\\\ \\theta_{y,i} \\\\ \\theta_{z,i} \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_{y,i} \\\\ -\\theta_{x,i} \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ therefore depends on the translational DOFs $u_{x,i}, u_{y,i}, u_{z,i}$ and the bending/transverse-shear-related rotational DOFs $\\theta_{x,i}, \\theta_{y,i}$. Critically, the drilling rotation $\\theta_{z,i}$ does not appear in this expression. Consequently, the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ is kinematically independent of the drilling rotation $\\theta_z$.\n\nThe strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is derived from the gradient of the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$. The problem specifically concerns the membrane strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^m$, defined as the symmetric part of the in-plane displacement gradient:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^m = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\nabla_s \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla_s \\mathbf{u})^T)\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{u}$ is independent of any $\\theta_{z,i}$, its spatial derivatives are also independent of $\\theta_{z,i}$. This means that all components of the strain tensor, including the membrane strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^m$, are independent of the drilling rotation $\\theta_z$.\n\nThe strain-displacement relationship is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = B\\,q_e$. The matrix $B$ is constructed by taking the derivatives of the shape functions and kinematic terms. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is independent of $\\theta_z$, the columns of the $B$ matrix that multiply the $\\theta_z$ degrees of freedom must be identically zero. This applies to the membrane block $B_m$ as well as the bending and shear blocks. This lack of coupling means that the strain energy is also independent of $\\theta_z$, resulting in zero-valued rows and columns in the element stiffness matrix corresponding to the $\\theta_z$ DOFs, leading to a singular matrix. This is the \"drilling rotation\" problem.\n\nTo overcome this singularity, a stabilization term is required. As stated in the problem, a penalty energy is added, which couples the nodal rotation $\\theta_z$ to the in-plane spin $\\omega_z = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\partial u_y / \\partial x - \\partial u_x / \\partial y)$. The spin $\\omega_z$ is derived from the translational DOFs. The penalty term creates a stiffness contribution for $\\theta_z$ and couples it to the translational DOFs, resolving the singularity. The Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) method does not alter this fundamental kinematic independence.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In standard continuum-based kinematics, the columns of the membrane $B_m$ associated with $\\theta_z$ are identically zero; $\\theta_z$ does not couple to membrane strains. Any coupling of $\\theta_z$ to the translational DOF arises only through an added stabilization term that penalizes $\\theta_z-\\omega_z$, which involves the antisymmetric in-plane spin and is not part of the membrane strain definition. ANS does not alter this fact.**\nThis statement is a precise and complete summary of the situation derived above. The columns of $B_m$ for $\\theta_z$ are zero due to the kinematics. The coupling is artificial, introduced by a stabilization term that relates the nodal DOF $\\theta_z$ to the continuum spin $\\omega_z$, which is distinct from membrane strain. ANS does not change this fundamental aspect.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\theta_z$ directly couples to membrane strains because the definition of membrane strain includes the antisymmetric part of the in-plane displacement gradient...**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The problem correctly defines membrane strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^m$ as the *symmetric* part of the gradient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In a degenerated solid-shell with ANS, $\\theta_z$ couples to membrane strains via induced thickness stretch...**\nThis statement makes a false claim. As shown in the derivation, rotation about the shell normal ($\\theta_z$) does not produce any displacement or strain in this kinematic formulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The drilling rotation $\\theta_z$ is always statically condensed at the element level... and no explicit stabilization term is required...**\nThis statement is incorrect. Static condensation requires a non-singular sub-matrix to invert. Since the stiffness associated with $\\theta_z$ is initially zero, it cannot be statically condensed. An explicit stabilization term is required.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. With a proper choice of ANS sampling points, the $\\theta_z$ contribution vanishes in the membrane block but reappears in the bending block...**\nThe contribution of $\\theta_z$ is already zero in both the membrane and bending blocks of $B$ due to the fundamental kinematics.
