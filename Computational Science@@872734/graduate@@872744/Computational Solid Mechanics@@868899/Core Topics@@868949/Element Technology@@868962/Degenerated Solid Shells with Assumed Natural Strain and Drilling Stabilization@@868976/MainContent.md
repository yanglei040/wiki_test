## Introduction
Degenerated solid-[shell elements](@entry_id:176094) represent a cornerstone of modern [computational solid mechanics](@entry_id:169583), offering a powerful and versatile approach for analyzing thin-walled structures like plates and shells. By starting with 3D [continuum kinematics](@entry_id:747813) and applying specific constraints, they elegantly avoid many complexities associated with classical shell theories. However, this powerful approach is not without its pitfalls. Naive formulations suffer from severe numerical pathologies, including shear and [membrane locking](@entry_id:172269)—an artificial stiffening that renders results meaningless—and from [spurious zero-energy modes](@entry_id:755267) related to the 'drilling' rotation, which cause [numerical instability](@entry_id:137058).

This article provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and overcoming these challenges. We will dissect the formulation of a robust and accurate degenerated solid-shell element by systematically addressing its inherent flaws. By the end, you will grasp the advanced techniques required to build a high-performance element suitable for complex engineering simulations. Our exploration begins in the **Principles and Mechanisms** chapter, where we establish the element's kinematic foundation, diagnose the root causes of locking, and detail the elegant remedies provided by the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) method and drilling stabilization. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will validate the element's performance and explore its use in advanced fields like plasticity and composites. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers targeted problems to solidify your theoretical understanding and prepare you for practical implementation.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and mechanisms underlying the formulation of degenerated solid-[shell elements](@entry_id:176094). We begin by establishing the geometric and kinematic framework, followed by a rigorous examination of [strain measures](@entry_id:755495) in the element's [natural coordinate system](@entry_id:168947). Subsequently, we will dissect the numerical pathologies known as shear and [membrane locking](@entry_id:172269), which plague simple formulations. The primary focus will then shift to the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) method, a powerful technique to remedy these issues. Finally, we will address the separate but crucial concept of drilling stabilization, which is necessary to ensure numerical stability.

### The Geometric and Kinematic Foundation

The **degenerated solid-shell** concept represents a departure from classical shell theories that are formulated on a two-dimensional manifold. Instead, it begins with the well-understood [kinematics](@entry_id:173318) of a three-dimensional solid continuum and systematically reduces its kinematic freedom to be suitable for thin structures. This approach elegantly circumvents the complexities of rotational updates in large-deformation analysis inherent to classical shell formulations.

The starting point is a standard three-dimensional hexahedral solid element, typically an 8-node brick, defined over a [parent domain](@entry_id:169388) with [natural coordinates](@entry_id:176605) $(\xi, \eta, \zeta) \in [-1, 1]^3$. The key step is the "degeneration" of the geometry. Rather than defining the position of all eight nodes independently, the geometry is constructed from a midsurface and a [director field](@entry_id:195269). The position vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ of any point within the element is parameterized as follows [@problem_id:3557463]:

$$
\boldsymbol{x}(\xi, \eta, \zeta) = \boldsymbol{r}(\xi, \eta) + \zeta \, \boldsymbol{t}(\xi, \eta)
$$

Here, $\boldsymbol{r}(\xi, \eta) = \sum_{a=1}^{4} \hat{N}_a(\xi, \eta) \boldsymbol{r}_a$ represents the position of the midsurface, interpolated from the four midsurface nodal positions $\boldsymbol{r}_a$ using bilinear [shape functions](@entry_id:141015) $\hat{N}_a(\xi, \eta)$. The term $\boldsymbol{t}(\xi, \eta) = \sum_{a=1}^{4} \hat{N}_a(\xi, \eta) \frac{h_a}{2} \boldsymbol{d}_a$ is the director vector field, which describes the orientation and length of the "fiber" running through the shell's thickness. It is interpolated from the nodal directors $\boldsymbol{d}_a$ and nodal thicknesses $h_a$. This formulation implies that lines that are initially straight through the thickness remain straight, a kinematic assumption central to Reissner-Mindlin-type theories.

From this geometric mapping, we can define the **covariant base vectors**, which form a local, generally [non-orthogonal basis](@entry_id:154908) at any point $(\xi, \eta, \zeta)$:

$$
\boldsymbol{g}_\xi = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}{\partial \xi}, \quad \boldsymbol{g}_\eta = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}{\partial \eta}, \quad \boldsymbol{g}_\zeta = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}{\partial \zeta}
$$

A direct consequence of the straight-director kinematic assumption is that the through-thickness base vector, $\boldsymbol{g}_\zeta = \boldsymbol{t}(\xi, \eta)$, is independent of the thickness coordinate $\zeta$. The three base vectors form the columns of the **Jacobian matrix**, $\boldsymbol{J} = [\boldsymbol{g}_\xi, \boldsymbol{g}_\eta, \boldsymbol{g}_\zeta]$, which maps differential elements from the [parent domain](@entry_id:169388) to the physical domain: $d\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{J} d\boldsymbol{\xi}$.

A crucial distinction from classical [shell elements](@entry_id:176094) lies in the degrees of freedom (DOFs) [@problem_id:3557463]. Degenerated solid-[shell elements](@entry_id:176094) operate exclusively with the translational DOFs of the underlying solid element's nodes (e.g., 3 translations for each of the 8 nodes). Rotational behavior, such as bending, emerges naturally from the differential motion of these nodes. In contrast, classical [shell elements](@entry_id:176094) are formulated with both translational and rotational DOFs defined on the midsurface. This fundamental difference in kinematic description has profound implications for the element's formulation and performance.

### Strain Measures: From Cartesian to Natural Coordinates

Strain is the measure of deformation. In the context of small-strain theory, the state of strain at a point is described by the Cartesian [strain tensor](@entry_id:193332) $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \boldsymbol{u} + (\nabla \boldsymbol{u})^{\mathrm{T}})$. While this definition is universal, for the purpose of element formulation and, specifically, for implementing the ANS method, it is highly advantageous to express the strains in the element's own [natural coordinate system](@entry_id:168947).

The **natural strain components** are the components of the Cartesian strain tensor $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ projected onto the local [covariant basis](@entry_id:198968) $\{\boldsymbol{g}_\xi, \boldsymbol{g}_\eta, \boldsymbol{g}_\zeta\}$. The transformation is achieved through a bilinear form. For instance, the [normal strain](@entry_id:204633) in the $\xi$-direction and the engineering [shear strain](@entry_id:175241) between the $\xi$ and $\eta$ directions are defined as follows [@problem_id:3557512]:

$$
\epsilon_{\xi\xi} = \boldsymbol{g}_\xi^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \, \boldsymbol{g}_\xi
$$
$$
\gamma_{\xi\eta} = 2 \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\xi\eta} = 2 \, \boldsymbol{g}_\xi^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \, \boldsymbol{g}_\eta
$$

These are the covariant components of the strain tensor. In a similar vein, one can define the contravariant components using the contravariant base vectors $\{\boldsymbol{g}^\xi, \boldsymbol{g}^\eta, \boldsymbol{g}^\zeta\}$, which are the rows of the inverse Jacobian matrix $\boldsymbol{J}^{-1}$. The transformation from Cartesian strain components (in Voigt notation, $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathrm{cart}}$) to natural strain components ($\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathrm{nat}}$) can be represented by a $6 \times 6$ transformation matrix $\boldsymbol{T}$ such that $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathrm{nat}} = \boldsymbol{T} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\mathrm{cart}}$.

To make this concrete, consider the task of finding this matrix $\boldsymbol{T}$ for a specific element geometry at its center point $(\xi, \eta, \zeta) = (0,0,0)$ [@problem_id:3557443]. By first computing the covariant base vectors $\boldsymbol{g}_\xi, \boldsymbol{g}_\eta, \boldsymbol{g}_\zeta$ from the element's nodal coordinates, one assembles the Jacobian $\boldsymbol{J}$. Inverting this matrix yields the contravariant base vectors $\boldsymbol{g}^\xi, \boldsymbol{g}^\eta, \boldsymbol{g}^\zeta$. The entries of the [transformation matrix](@entry_id:151616) $\boldsymbol{T}$ are then populated using the general transformation rule for second-order tensors, e.g., for contravariant components, $\epsilon^{ij} = \boldsymbol{g}^i \cdot \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \cdot \boldsymbol{g}^j$. This exercise demonstrates that the "natural strains" are not a new physical quantity but simply a representation of the familiar Cartesian [strain tensor](@entry_id:193332) in a basis that is geometrically meaningful for the specific element. This local representation is the key to diagnosing and curing locking.

The specific form of the natural strain components ultimately depends on the chosen interpolation for the displacement field $\boldsymbol{u}$. For example, if a simplified displacement interpolation that is constant through the thickness, $\boldsymbol{u}(\xi,\eta,\zeta) = \sum_{a=1}^{n} N_{a}(\xi,\eta)\,\boldsymbol{u}_{a}$, were used, the derivative $\partial \boldsymbol{u} / \partial \zeta$ would vanish. The natural transverse [shear strain](@entry_id:175241), kinematically defined as $\gamma_{\xi\zeta} = \boldsymbol{g}_\xi \cdot \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial \zeta} + \boldsymbol{g}_\zeta \cdot \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial \xi}$, would then simplify considerably [@problem_id:3557480]. This highlights that the expressions for strains are intimately tied to the kinematic assumptions of the element formulation.

### The Pathology of Locking Phenomena

If a standard, low-order degenerated solid-shell element is used to model a thin plate or shell, it exhibits a catastrophic failure mode known as **locking**. This phenomenon manifests as an excessive, non-physical stiffness that prevents the element from deforming correctly, especially in bending. The root cause lies in the inability of the low-order [polynomial interpolation](@entry_id:145762) of displacements to simultaneously satisfy the physical deformation mode and the kinematic constraints that become active in the thin limit.

To understand locking, one must consider the relative scaling of different types of [strain energy](@entry_id:162699) [@problem_id:3557457]. For a shell of thickness $t$, the bending energy $U_b$ scales with $t^3$, while the transverse shear energy $U_s$ and membrane energy $U_m$ scale linearly with $t$. As the shell becomes very thin ($t \to 0$), the [bending energy](@entry_id:174691) becomes orders of magnitude smaller than the other two. For the element to behave correctly in a bending-dominated scenario, the numerically computed shear and membrane strains must vanish, so that their corresponding energies do not "pollute" the solution. When they fail to do so, locking occurs.

#### Shear Locking

**Shear locking** arises when a thin element is subjected to [pure bending](@entry_id:202969). According to the Kirchhoff-Love theory for thin plates, this deformation should occur without any transverse [shear strain](@entry_id:175241). However, a standard low-order [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) cannot represent a curved shape while simultaneously maintaining zero [shear strain](@entry_id:175241) at all points. This results in parasitic, non-zero shear strains. If these parasitic strains are evaluated at all integration points (full integration), the resulting shear energy $U_s \sim O(t)$ will completely dominate the true [bending energy](@entry_id:174691) $U_b \sim O(t^3)$. To minimize the total energy, the numerical solution suppresses bending altogether, "locking" the element.

A stark illustration of this [pathology](@entry_id:193640) can be seen by considering the integration of bending stiffness through the thickness [@problem_id:3557446]. The exact [bending stiffness](@entry_id:180453) of a plate is $D_b = E t^3 / 12$, obtained by integrating the contribution of [stress and strain](@entry_id:137374) through the thickness, $\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} E z^2 dz$. If this integral is approximated with a single integration point at the mid-surface ($z=0$), the result is zero, because the bending strain is zero at the neutral axis. The element registers no [bending stiffness](@entry_id:180453) whatsoever. This demonstrates that a naive numerical implementation fails to capture the essential physics of bending. While using more integration points (e.g., two-point Gauss quadrature) resolves this specific issue for [bending stiffness](@entry_id:180453) calculation, it does not solve the general problem of parasitic shear strains.

#### Membrane Locking

**Membrane locking** is a similar [pathology](@entry_id:193640) that primarily affects curved shells or flat shells undergoing [large rotations](@entry_id:751151). It occurs when the element is subjected to a state of inextensional bending—a deformation that involves bending without any stretching of the midsurface. A low-order element's interpolation scheme is often too poor to represent this curved, inextensible mode. It consequently introduces spurious membrane strains. Again, the associated membrane energy $U_m \sim O(t)$ dominates the bending energy, and the element locks.

We can demonstrate this mechanism with a striking example [@problem_id:3557485]. Consider a single, initially flat element undergoing [pure bending](@entry_id:202969) with a [constant curvature](@entry_id:162122) $\kappa$. The [kinematics](@entry_id:173318) of a degenerated solid shell, when expanded for this deformation, reveal that the axial Green-Lagrange strain component $E_{xx}$ at a distance $\zeta$ from the midsurface contains not only the expected linear term proportional to bending ($t \zeta \kappa$) but also a spurious quadratic term proportional to $t^2 \zeta^2 \kappa^2$. While the linear bending term averages to zero through the thickness, the spurious quadratic term does not. When averaged using a standard two-point Gauss quadrature, a net, non-physical membrane strain of $\langle E_{xx} \rangle_G = t^2 \kappa^2 / 24$ remains. This parasitic strain generates an enormous amount of artificial membrane energy, locking the element against bending.

### The Remedy: Assumed Natural Strain (ANS)

The **Assumed Natural Strain (ANS)** method is an elegant and effective technique for alleviating locking. The fundamental insight of ANS is that locking is caused by using the "compatible" strain field—the one derived directly from the displacement interpolation—which is overly constrained. The solution is to replace this problematic strain field with a simpler, "assumed" strain field that is constructed to have the correct kinematic properties.

Crucially, ANS does not modify all strain components. It selectively targets only those responsible for locking [@problem_id:3557488].
-   To combat **[shear locking](@entry_id:164115)**, the ANS method focuses on the natural transverse shear strains, $\gamma_{\xi\zeta}$ and $\gamma_{\eta\zeta}$.
-   To combat **[membrane locking](@entry_id:172269)**, a similar strategy can be applied to the in-plane membrane strains, $\epsilon_{\xi\xi}$, $\epsilon_{\eta\eta}$, and $\gamma_{\xi\eta}$, often through related techniques like the $\bar{B}$ method.

The mechanism of ANS involves two steps [@problem_id:3557512]:
1.  **Sampling:** The problematic natural strain components (e.g., $\gamma_{\xi\zeta}$) are evaluated from the compatible displacement field at a specific set of discrete locations within the element, known as **tying points**. These points are chosen strategically where the strains are known to be physically most representative (e.g., at the midpoints of the element edges).
2.  **Interpolation:** A new, assumed strain field is constructed by interpolating the values from these tying points over the entire element. This new field is then used to compute the element's internal forces and [stiffness matrix](@entry_id:178659).

This procedure effectively replaces the complex, locking-prone strain field with a lower-order one that is "weaker" and correctly represents the [zero-energy modes](@entry_id:172472) associated with [pure bending](@entry_id:202969). For example, a properly constructed assumed shear field will be identically zero for any state of [pure bending](@entry_id:202969), thus completely eliminating [shear locking](@entry_id:164115). It is vital to recognize that ANS is a modification of the strain-displacement relationship at the discrete level; it does not alter the underlying geometric mapping of the element [@problem_id:3557463].

The ANS method is one of several advanced element technologies. Other prominent methods include the **Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components (MITC)**, which is a formal [projection method](@entry_id:144836) to enforce field consistency, and the **Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS)** method, which is derived from a multi-field [variational principle](@entry_id:145218) (the Hu-Washizu principle) and introduces additional internal strain parameters that are eliminated at the element level via [static condensation](@entry_id:176722) [@problem_id:3557496]. While the theoretical foundations differ, all these methods share the common goal of creating a more flexible strain field to prevent locking.

### The Challenge of Spurious Modes: Drilling Stabilization

Solving the locking problem is not the final step. Degenerated solid-[shell elements](@entry_id:176094), due to their 3D [continuum kinematics](@entry_id:747813), suffer from another numerical pathology: a lack of stiffness corresponding to rotation about the shell normal. This is known as the **drilling degree of freedom**.

The physical origin of this problem lies in classical continuum mechanics [@problem_id:3557519]. In a standard (Cauchy) continuum, the stress tensor is symmetric, and there is no energetic conjugate to local material spin. The [internal virtual work](@entry_id:172278) depends only on strain (the symmetric part of the [displacement gradient](@entry_id:165352)), not on rotation (the skew-symmetric part). In a finite element context, this means that an in-plane rotation of the element nodes about the shell normal produces no [strain energy](@entry_id:162699). This leads to a **[zero-energy mode](@entry_id:169976)**, which corresponds to a zero on the diagonal of the stiffness matrix, rendering it singular and the numerical problem ill-posed.

The solution is **drilling stabilization**, which involves adding a small, controlled artificial stiffness to this drilling mode. A robust and consistent stabilization scheme must be effective at eliminating the singularity without polluting the physical response of the element. A naive penalty on the absolute drilling rotation would fail the patch test (i.e., generate energy in a constant strain state).

A physically sound and widely used approach penalizes the mismatch between an independently interpolated drilling rotation field, $\theta_d$, and the drilling rotation kinematically derived from the [displacement field](@entry_id:141476), $\omega_n = \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{n} \cdot (\nabla_s \times \boldsymbol{u})$ [@problem_id:3557519]. The stabilization energy takes the form:

$$
\Pi_{\mathrm{drill}} = \int_{\mathcal{A}} \frac{c_d}{2} \left( \theta_d - \omega_n \right)^2 dA
$$

The [penalty parameter](@entry_id:753318) $c_d$ must be carefully scaled with the material and geometric properties. Since drilling is an in-plane shear phenomenon, the stiffness should scale with the membrane shear stiffness, i.e., $c_d \propto Gt$, where $G$ is the [shear modulus](@entry_id:167228) and $t$ is the thickness. This method correctly penalizes spurious relative rotations within the element while being zero for rigid body rotations, thus passing the patch test. It is an independent, additive procedure that complements the ANS formulation for locking, ensuring the final element is both accurate and numerically stable [@problem_id:3557457].
