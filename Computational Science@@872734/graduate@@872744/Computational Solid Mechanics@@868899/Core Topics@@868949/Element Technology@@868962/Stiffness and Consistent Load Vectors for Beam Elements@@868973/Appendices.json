The total potential energy $\\Pi$ of the system is the sum of the internal strain energy $U$ and the potential of the external loads $\\Pi_{ext}$. The system is in equilibrium when $\\Pi$ is stationary, i.e., its first variation with respect to the degrees of freedom is zero.\n\nThe strain energy for an Euler-Bernoulli beam is given by:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L} E I \\left( \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} \\right)^{2} dx$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area, and $w(x)$ is the transverse displacement field.\n\nThe external load is a concentrated force $P$ applied at $x=L$. The work done by this load is $W_{ext} = P w(L)$. The potential of this external load is $\\Pi_{ext} = -W_{ext} = -P w(L)$.\n\nThe total potential energy is $\\Pi = U + \\Pi_{ext} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L} E I \\left( \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} \\right)^{2} dx - P w(L)$.\n\nThe problem specifies a cubic Hermite interpolation for the displacement field $w(x)$ in terms of the nodal degrees of freedom $\\mathbf{d}_e = \\begin{pmatrix} w_1 & \\theta_1 & w_2 & \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$. The displacement field is written as $w(x) = \\mathbf{N}(x)\\mathbf{d}_e$, where $\\mathbf{N}(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} N_1(x) & N_2(x) & N_3(x) & N_4(x) \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of shape functions.\n\nFirst, we derive the shape functions. A general cubic polynomial $w(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3$ is assumed. The rotation is $\\theta(x) = w'(x) = a_1 + 2 a_2 x + 3 a_3 x^2$. The four coefficients $a_i$ are determined by enforcing the nodal conditions:\n$w(0) = w_1 \\implies a_0 = w_1$\n$\\theta(0) = \\theta_1 \\implies a_1 = \\theta_1$\n$w(L) = w_2 \\implies a_0 + a_1 L + a_2 L^2 + a_3 L^3 = w_2$\n$\\theta(L) = \\theta_2 \\implies a_1 + 2 a_2 L + 3 a_3 L^2 = \\theta_2$\n\nSolving this system for $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of the nodal DOFs and substituting back into the expression for $w(x)$ yields the displacement field in terms of the Hermite shape functions:\n$w(x) = N_1(x)w_1 + N_2(x)\\theta_1 + N_3(x)w_2 + N_4(x)\\theta_2$, where:\n$N_1(x) = 1 - 3\\frac{x^2}{L^2} + 2\\frac{x^3}{L^3}$\n$N_2(x) = x - 2\\frac{x^2}{L} + \\frac{x^3}{L^2}$\n$N_3(x) = 3\\frac{x^2}{L^2} - 2\\frac{x^3}{L^3}$\n$N_4(x) = -\\frac{x^2}{L} + \\frac{x^3}{L^2}$\n\nNext, we formulate the curvature-displacement relationship. The curvature is $\\kappa(x) = w''(x)$. Using the interpolated displacement field, we have:\n$\\kappa(x) = w''(x) = \\mathbf{N}''(x)\\mathbf{d}_e = \\mathbf{B}(x)\\mathbf{d}_e$\nThe curvature-displacement operator $\\mathbf{B}(x)$ is the row vector of second derivatives of the shape functions:\n$\\mathbf{B}(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} N_1''(x) & N_2''(x) & N_3''(x) & N_4''(x) \\end{pmatrix}$\n$N_1''(x) = -\\frac{6}{L^2} + \\frac{12x}{L^3}$\n$N_2''(x) = -\\frac{4}{L} + \\frac{6x}{L^2}$\n$N_3''(x) = \\frac{6}{L^2} - \\frac{12x}{L^3}$\n$N_4''(x) = -\\frac{2}{L} + \\frac{6x}{L^2}$\n\nNow, we substitute the interpolated fields into the potential energy expression. The strain energy becomes:\n$U = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L} E I (\\mathbf{B}(x)\\mathbf{d}_e)^2 dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{d}_e^{\\mathsf{T}} \\left( E I \\int_{0}^{L} \\mathbf{B}(x)^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{B}(x) dx \\right) \\mathbf{d}_e$\nThis expression defines the element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_e$ as:\n$$\\mathbf{K}_e = E I \\int_{0}^{L} \\mathbf{B}(x)^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{B}(x) dx$$\nThe entries $K_{ij}$ of the stiffness matrix are $K_{ij} = E I \\int_{0}^{L} N_i''(x) N_j''(x) dx$. Performing the exact integration for each entry yields the symmetric $4 \\times 4$ matrix. For example, the first element is:\n$K_{11} = E I \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(-\\frac{6}{L^2} + \\frac{12x}{L^3}\\right)^2 dx = E I \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(\\frac{36}{L^4} - \\frac{144x}{L^5} + \\frac{144x^2}{L^6}\\right) dx = EI \\left[\\frac{36x}{L^4} - \\frac{72x^2}{L^5} + \\frac{48x^3}{L^6}\\right]_0^L = EI \\left(\\frac{36}{L^3} - \\frac{72}{L^3} + \\frac{48}{L^3}\\right) = \\frac{12EI}{L^3}$.\nAfter computing all unique integrals, the full stiffness matrix is found:\n$$\\mathbf{K}_e = \\frac{EI}{L^3} \\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 6L & -12 & 6L \\\\ 6L & 4L^2 & -6L & 2L^2 \\\\ -12 & -6L & 12 & -6L \\\\ 6L & 2L^2 & -6L & 4L^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe potential of the external load is expressed in terms of nodal DOFs:\n$\\Pi_{ext} = -P w(L) = -P \\mathbf{N}(L) \\mathbf{d}_e$.\nWe evaluate the shape functions at $x=L$:\n$N_1(L) = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0$\n$N_2(L) = L - 2L + L = 0$\n$N_3(L) = 3 - 2 = 1$\n$N_4(L) = -L + L = 0$\nSo, $\\mathbf{N}(L) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\Pi_{ext} = -P w_2$.\n\nThe total potential energy is $\\Pi = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{d}_e^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{K}_e\\mathbf{d}_e - P w_2$.\nThe principle of stationary potential energy requires $\\delta \\Pi = 0$, which leads to the system of equations $\\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{d}_e = \\mathbf{f}_e$. The consistent nodal load vector $\\mathbf{f}_e$ is given by the partial derivatives of the work potential with respect to the nodal DOFs, $\\mathbf{f}_e = (\\frac{\\partial W_{ext}}{\\partial\\mathbf{d}_e})^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n$W_{ext} = Pw(L) = P \\mathbf{N}(L) \\mathbf{d}_e$. Thus, $\\mathbf{f}_e = (P \\mathbf{N}(L))^{\\mathsf{T}} = P (\\mathbf{N}(L))^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\nSubstituting the values for $\\mathbf{N}(L)$:\n$$\\mathbf{f}_e = P \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ P \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFinally, we construct the requested $4 \\times 5$ augmented matrix $[\\mathbf{K}_e | \\mathbf{f}_e]$ by juxtaposing the stiffness matrix and the load vector.\n$$[\\mathbf{K}_e | \\mathbf{f}_e] = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{12EI}{L^3} & \\frac{6EI}{L^2} & -\\frac{12EI}{L^3} & \\frac{6EI}{L^2} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{6EI}{L^2} & \\frac{4EI}{L} & -\\frac{6EI}{L^2} & \\frac{2EI}{L} & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{12EI}{L^3} & -\\frac{6EI}{L^2} & \\frac{12EI}{L^3} & -\\frac{6EI}{L^2} & P \\\\\n\\frac{6EI}{L^2} & \\frac{2EI}{L} & -\\frac{6EI}{L^2} & \\frac{4EI}{L} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{12EI}{L^{3}} & \\frac{6EI}{L^{2}} & -\\frac{12EI}{L^{3}} & \\frac{6EI}{L^{2}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{6EI}{L^{2}} & \\frac{4EI}{L} & -\\frac{6EI}{L^{2}} & \\frac{2EI}{L} & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{12EI}{L^{3}} & -\\frac{6EI}{L^{2}} & \\frac{12EI}{L^{3}} & -\\frac{6EI}{L^{2}} & P \\\\ \\frac{6EI}{L^{2}} & \\frac{2EI}{L} & -\\frac{6EI}{L^{2}} & \\frac{4EI}{L} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2617208"}, {"introduction": "Consistent load vectors are defined to be work-equivalent to the distributed loads they represent, a concept rooted in the principle of virtual work.

Hence, the integrand is a polynomial of degree up to $5$. Gauss–Legendre quadrature with $n$ points is exact for polynomials up to degree $2 n - 1$. Therefore, a $3$-point Gauss rule ($2 n - 1 = 5$) integrates these terms exactly, yielding the exact consistent nodal moments. In contrast, the one-point rule ($2 n - 1 = 1$) is exact only up to degree $1$; applying it to degree-$3$ to degree-$5$ integrands introduces systematic errors in the equivalent nodal moments, as quantified by $\\Delta M_{1}$ above. Notably, even for a constant load ($b = 0$, $c = 0$), the error $\\Delta M_{1} = \\frac{L^{2} a}{24}$ is non-zero because the integrand $h_{2}(s)\\, a$ remains cubic. Under-integration thus compromises energy consistency and the accuracy of moment transfer from distributed loads to nodal generalized forces, with the magnitude of the error increasing with $L$ and with higher-order coefficients $b$ and $c$. The expression derived provides an exact measure of this effect for the left nodal moment under a quadratic load.
