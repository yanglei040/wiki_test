The flexural rigidity, $EI$, is also constant. We are tasked with deriving the curvature $\\kappa(x)$, bending moment $M(x)$, and shear force $V(x)$ based on the principles of Euler–Bernoulli beam theory.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the curvature, $\\kappa(x)$.

The choice of a cubic polynomial is the simplest one that allows for four degrees of freedom (deflection and rotation at two nodes), which ensures $C^1$ continuity (continuity of slope) between elements, a requirement for a conforming Euler–Bernoulli beam element. The consequence of this is that the second derivative (curvature) is linear and the third derivative (related to shear) is constant. This implies that the element inherently assumes a constant shear force along its length. Therefore, this finite element formulation cannot exactly represent a varying shear force, which would result from a distributed transverse load $q(x)$ (since $dV/dx = -q(x)$).
