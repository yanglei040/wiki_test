The solution hinges on a fundamental symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the structure of the coupled-cluster operators.\n\nThe problem is approached by first analyzing the properties of the Hamiltonian and the ansatz for the wave function, specifically with respect to the concept of seniority. Seniority, denoted by $v$, is defined as the number of fermions in a given state that are not part of time-reversed pairs. A time-reversed pair is a pair of fermions in states $(p, \\uparrow)$ and $(\\bar{p}, \\downarrow)$, where $\\bar{p}$ is the time-reversed partner of $p$. The operator that creates such a pair is given as $P^{\\dagger}_{p} \\equiv a^{\\dagger}_{p\\uparrow} a^{\\dagger}_{\\bar{p}\\downarrow}$.\n\nLet us analyze the given Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH = H_{0} + V = \\sum_{p,\\sigma} \\varepsilon_{p} \\, a^{\\dagger}_{p\\sigma} a_{p\\sigma} + \\lambda \\sum_{p p'} f(p) f(p') \\, P^{\\dagger}_{p} P_{p'}\n$$\nThe one-body part, $H_{0}$, is a number operator for each single-particle orbital and thus conserves the number of particles in each orbital. It does not break pairs, and is therefore seniority-conserving.\nThe two-body interaction, $V$, is proportional to $P^{\\dagger}_{p} P_{p'}$. The operator $P_{p'}$ annihilates a time-reversed pair in orbital $p'$, and the operator $P^{\\dagger}_{p}$ creates a time-reversed pair in orbital $p$. The net effect of the interaction is to scatter a pair from one orbital to another. Since it only acts on pairs, it does not change the number of unpaired fermions. Thus, the interaction $V$ is also seniority-conserving.\nSince both $H_0$ and $V$ are seniority-conserving, the total Hamiltonian $H$ is a seniority-conserving operator. This means that for any two states $|\\Psi_1\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi_2\\rangle$ with seniorities $v_1$ and $v_2$ respectively, the matrix element $\\langle \\Psi_1 | H | \\Psi_2 \\rangle$ is non-zero only if $v_1 = v_2$.\n\nThe reference state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ is the Hartree-Fock ground state of an even-even closed-shell nucleus, which is described as filling all orbitals below a Fermi momentum with time-reversed pairs. By this definition, all fermions in $|\\Phi\\rangle$ are paired, so the seniority of the reference state is $v=0$.\n\nThe coupled-cluster calculation is performed at the CCSD level, with the cluster operator $T = T_2$ (since $T_1=0$). The problem specifies that $T_2$ is \"restricted to seniority-zero pair excitations.\" This means that $T_2$ exclusively creates $2$-particle-$2$-hole ($2p-2h$) excitations that are themselves seniority-zero states. An operator that accomplishes this has the form:\n$$\nT_2 = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{holes}, a \\in \\text{particles}} c_{ia} P_a^{\\dagger} P_i\n$$\nwhere $c_{ia}$ are the cluster amplitudes, $P_a^{\\dagger}$ creates a particle-pair, and $P_i \\equiv a_{\\bar{i}\\downarrow} a_{i\\uparrow}$ annihilates a hole-pair. This form of $T_2$ acting on a state of seniority $v$ produces a state of seniority $v$. Thus, the specified $T_2$ operator is seniority-conserving.\n\nThe triples correction $E^{(T)}$ is constructed from the triples amplitudes $t_{abc}^{ijk}$, which are approximated as:\n$$\nt_{abc}^{ijk} \\approx \\frac{W_{abc}^{ijk}}{\\Delta_{abc}^{ijk}}\n$$\nThe numerator $W_{abc}^{ijk}$ is the connected triples residual, which is given by the matrix element of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H} \\equiv \\exp(-T_2) H_N \\exp(T_2)$ between the reference state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ and a $3p-3h$ excited state $|\\Phi_{ijk}^{abc}\\rangle$. Note that the normal-ordered Hamiltonian $H_N$ is also seniority-conserving because it is derived from $H$.\n$$\nW_{abc}^{ijk} = \\langle \\Phi_{ijk}^{abc} | \\bar{H} | \\Phi \\rangle\n$$\nThe notation for the indices on $W$ is secondary to the fact that this is a matrix element between the reference state and a $3p-3h$ state. Let us analyze the seniority of the states involved.\nAs established, the reference state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ has seniority $v=0$.\nNow, consider the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H}$. It is constructed from a BCH expansion involving communicators of $H_N$ and $T_2$. Since both $H_N$ and $T_2$ are seniority-conserving operators, any commutator involving them, such as $[H_N, T_2]$, is also seniority-conserving. Consequently, every term in the BCH expansion is seniority-conserving, which means the operator $\\bar{H}$ is seniority-conserving.\n\nNext, we must determine the seniority of a $3p-3h$ state $|\\Phi_{ijk}^{abc}\\rangle = a_a^\\dagger a_b^\\dagger a_c^\\dagger a_k a_j a_i |\\Phi\\rangle$. This state is formed by creating three particles in initially empty orbitals and creating three holes in initially filled orbitals. The three particles $\\{a, b, c\\}$ cannot all be part of time-reversed pairs; there will be at least one unpaired particle. The minimum particle seniority $v_p$ for three particles is $v_p=1$ (e.g., one pair and one unpaired particle). Similarly, the three holes $\\{i, j, k\\}$ will leave behind at least one unpaired fermion in the Fermi sea. The minimum hole seniority $v_h$ for three holes is $v_h=1$. The total seniority of the state is $v' = v_p + v_h$. Therefore, any $3p-3h$ state $|\\Phi_{ijk}^{abc}\\rangle$ has a minimum seniority of $v'_{min} = 1+1=2$. In all cases, $v' \\neq 0$.\n\nWe can now evaluate the triples residual, $W_{abc}^{ijk}$. It is the matrix element of a seniority-conserving operator $\\bar{H}$ between two states of different seniorities:\n- Initial state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ has seniority $v=0$.\n- Final state $|\\Phi_{ijk}^{abc}\\rangle$ has seniority $v' \\ge 2$.\n\nBecause $v' \\neq v$, the matrix element must be zero:\n$$\nW_{abc}^{ijk} = \\langle \\Phi_{ijk}^{abc} | \\bar{H} | \\Phi \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any choice of $i,j,k,a,b,c$.\n\nSince the triples residuals $W_{abc}^{ijk}$ are all identically zero, the approximate triples amplitudes are also zero:\n$$\nt_{abc}^{ijk} \\approx \\frac{0}{\\Delta_{abc}^{ijk}} = 0\n$$\nThe non-iterative triples correction to the energy, $E^{(T)}$, is constructed from these amplitudes. Any standard formulation of $E^{(T)}$ involves a summation of terms, where each term contains at least one factor of a triples amplitude $t_{abc}^{ijk}$. Since all triples amplitudes are zero, every term in the summation is zero.\n\nTherefore, the triples correction $E^{(T)}$ is identically zero for this model Hamiltonian and the given approximations.\n$$\nE^{(T)} = 0\n$$\nThe request for the answer in units of MeV is satisfied, as $0 \\, \\text{MeV}$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3580078"}, {"introduction": "While symmetries can provide elegant simplifications, real-world nuclear calculations often encounter practical challenges.

Derivation and Evaluation of the Energy Denominator\n\nIn Rayleigh–Schrödinger many-body perturbation theory (RS-MBPT) with a Møller–Plesset partitioning, the unperturbed Hamiltonian, $H_0$, is the Fock operator $F$, and the perturbation, $V$, is the residual two-body interaction.

This state is also an eigenstate of $H_0$ with eigenvalue $E_{ijk}^{abc,(0)}$. Its energy is the ground state energy plus the cost of removing the electrons from the occupied orbitals and placing them into virtual orbitals.\n$$E_{ijk}^{abc,(0)} = E_0^{(0)} - \\varepsilon_i - \\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_k + \\varepsilon_a + \\varepsilon_b + \\varepsilon_c$$\nThe energy denominator for a perturbative contribution involving the intermediate state $|\\Phi_{ijk}^{abc}\\rangle$ is the difference between the unperturbed energies of the ground state and the excited state.\n$$D_{ijk}^{abc} = E_0^{(0)} - E_{ijk}^{abc,(0)} = E_0^{(0)} - (E_0^{(0)} - \\varepsilon_i - \\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_k + \\varepsilon_a + \\varepsilon_b + \\varepsilon_c)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$D_{ijk}^{abc} = \\varepsilon_i + \\varepsilon_j + \\varepsilon_k - \\varepsilon_a - \\varepsilon_b - \\varepsilon_c$$\nUsing the provided orbital energies for the near-degenerate case:\n$\\varepsilon_i = -11.2$ MeV, $\\varepsilon_j = -6.7$ MeV, $\\varepsilon_k = -3.9$ MeV,\n$\\varepsilon_a = -7.4$ MeV, $\\varepsilon_b = -7.2$ MeV, $\\varepsilon_c = -7.1$ MeV.\nThe numerical value of the denominator is:\n$$D_{ijk}^{abc} = (-11.2) + (-6.7) + (-3.9) - ((-7.4) + (-7.2) + (-7.1)) \\text{ MeV}$$\n$$D_{ijk}^{abc} = -21.8 - (-21.7) \\text{ MeV} = -0.1 \\text{ MeV}$$\n\nFor the context question, we compute the denominator for the \"reference\" virtual set with $\\varepsilon_{a'} = -2.0$ MeV, $\\varepsilon_{b'} = -1.2$ MeV, and $\\varepsilon_{c'} = -0.6$ MeV, keeping the occupied energies the same.\n$$D_{ijk}^{a'b'c'} = \\varepsilon_i + \\varepsilon_j + \\varepsilon_k - \\varepsilon_{a'} - \\varepsilon_{b'} - \\varepsilon_{c'}$$\n$$D_{ijk}^{a'b'c'} = -21.8 - ((-2.0) + (-1.2) + (-0.6)) \\text{ MeV}$$\n$$D_{ijk}^{a'b'c'} = -21.8 - (-3.8) \\text{ MeV} = -18.0 \\text{ MeV}$$\nThe magnitude of the denominator in the near-degenerate case ($|D_{ijk}^{abc}| = 0.1$ MeV) is drastically smaller than in the reference case ($|D_{ijk}^{a'b'c'}| = 18.0$ MeV). Since the perturbative energy correction $E^{(T)}$ is inversely proportional to this denominator, the near-degenerate case will yield a much larger energy correction. This indicates a potential failure of the perturbative approach, as the small energy separation between the ground and excited states violates the assumption of a small perturbation. The result is numerically unstable because minute variations in the nearly degenerate orbital energies would cause large fluctuations in the calculated energy correction.\n\n2. Symmetry Factor and Energy Expression\n\nThe total perturbative triples energy correction, $E^{(T)}$, is obtained by summing contributions from all distinct triple excitation channels. To avoid overcounting identical contributions in a general summation over all indices, a symmetry factor is introduced. For a triple excitation involving three distinct hole indices ($i,j,k$) and three distinct particle indices ($a,b,c$), there are $3!$ permutations of the hole indices and $3!$ permutations of the particle indices. Since these are independent, there are $3! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 6 = 36$ ways to label a diagram with a specific set of six orbitals, all corresponding to the same physical channel.\n\nWhen the energy expression is written as a sum over all indices $i,j,k,a,b,c$, a symmetry factor of $S = \\frac{1}{3! \\times 3!} = \\frac{1}{36}$ is required to correctly count each distinct channel's contribution once. The general formula takes the form:\n$$E^{(T)}_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{36} \\sum_{i,j,k,a,b,c} \\frac{N(i,j,k,a,b,c)}{D(i,j,k,a,b,c)}$$\nwhere $N(i,j,k,a,b,c)$ is the fundamental numerator contribution for a specific set of labeled indices.\n\nThe problem states that only a single channel contributes to the energy, and it provides an \"effective scalar $M_{ijk}^{abc}$\" which represents the \"permutation-summed numerator contributions\". This implies that $M_{ijk}^{abc}$ is the sum of the fundamental numerator over all permutations for the given channel:\n$$M_{ijk}^{abc} = \\sum_{P \\in S_3} \\sum_{Q \\in S_3} N(P(i,j,k), Q(a,b,c))$$\nwhere $P$ and $Q$ are permutation operators acting on the hole and particle indices, respectively. The energy contribution from this single channel is found by restricting the total energy sum to only the permutations of the given indices:\n$$E^{(T)} = \\frac{1}{36} \\sum_{P \\in S_3} \\sum_{Q \\in S_3} \\frac{N(P(i,j,k), Q(a,b,c))}{D(P(i,j,k), Q(a,b,c))}$$\nSince we are using a canonical basis with distinct orbital energies, the denominator $D_{ijk}^{abc}$ is invariant under any permutation of the hole indices among themselves or the particle indices among themselves. Thus, we can factor it out of the summation:\n$$E^{(T)} = \\frac{1}{36 D_{ijk}^{abc}} \\sum_{P \\in S_3} \\sum_{Q \\in S_3} N(P(i,j,k), Q(a,b,c))$$\nSubstituting the given definition of $M_{ijk}^{abc}$, the expression for the single-channel perturbative triples energy correction is:\n$$E^{(T)} = \\frac{1}{36} \\frac{M_{ijk}^{abc}}{D_{ijk}^{abc}}$$\n\n3.

The formula given is $E_{3p3h}^{(0)} = \\epsilon_a + \\epsilon_b + \\epsilon_c - \\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_k$.\nThe given single-particle Hartree–Fock orbital energies are:\n- Particle orbitals: $\\epsilon_a = 5$ MeV, $\\epsilon_b = 8$ MeV, $\\epsilon_c = 12$ MeV.\n- Hole orbitals: $\\epsilon_i = -20$ MeV, $\\epsilon_j = -18$ MeV, $\\epsilon_k = -15$ MeV.\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nE_{3p3h}^{(0)} = (5 + 8 + 12) \\text{ MeV} - (-20 - 18 - 15) \\text{ MeV}\n$$\n$$\nE_{3p3h}^{(0)} = 25 \\text{ MeV} - (-53) \\text{ MeV} = 25 \\text{ MeV} + 53 \\text{ MeV} = 78 \\text{ MeV}\n$$\nNow we can compute $D$. The uncorrected EOM-CCSD excitation energy is given as $\\omega_{\\text{CCSD}} = 24.6$ MeV.\n$$\nD = E_{3p3h}^{(0)} - \\omega_{\\text{CCSD}} = 78 \\text{ MeV} - 24.6 \\text{ MeV} = 53.4 \\text{ MeV}\n$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the triples correction $\\Delta\\omega_{(T)}$ by substituting the calculated values of $M^2$ and $D$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega_{(T)} = -\\frac{M^2}{D} = -\\frac{5.1984 \\text{ MeV}^2}{53.4 \\text{ MeV}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega_{(T)} \\approx -0.09734831 \\text{ MeV}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the $9$. The fourth is the $4$. The following digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega_{(T)} \\approx -0.09735 \\text{ MeV}\n$$\nThis is the computed triples correction to the excitation energy under the specified minimal model and approximations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.09735}\n$$", "id": "3580084"}]}
