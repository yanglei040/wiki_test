It represents a standard, formalizable problem in nuclear many-body theory. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive the requested quantity within the specified approximation. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the potential energy density proceeds from the general principles of a uniform many-fermion system.\n\nThe total potential energy $U$ of a uniform fluid of $N$ particles in a volume $\\Omega$, interacting via a two-body central potential $V(r)$, is given by the expectation value of the potential energy operator. In terms of the total number density $\\rho = N/\\Omega$ and the pair distribution function $g(r)$, the potential energy density $\\varepsilon_{pot} = U/\\Omega$ is expressed as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{pot} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho^2 \\int V(r) g(r) d^3r\n$$\nThe pair distribution function $g(r)$ gives the probability of finding a particle at a distance $r$ from a reference particle, relative to a uniform distribution. The factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ corrects for the double-counting of pairs.\n\nThe task is to work within the Hartree approximation. This approximation neglects all correlations between particles, including the statistical correlations arising from the Pauli exclusion principle. In the Hartree approximation, the many-body wave function is a simple product of single-particle states, leading to a pair distribution function that is constant for all separations:\n$$\ng(r) = 1\n$$\nThis assumes that the presence of a particle at one point has no influence on the probability of finding another particle at any other point, which is a classical-like assumption.\n\nSubstituting $g(r)=1$ into the general expression for the potential energy density yields the Hartree potential energy density, denoted $\\varepsilon_{H}(\\rho)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{H}(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho^2 \\int V(r) d^3r\n$$\nThe problem specifies the two-body potential as:\n$$\nV(r) = V_{c}\\,\\theta(r_{c}-r) - V_{a}\\,\\frac{\\exp(-\\mu r)}{r}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. We must now evaluate the spatial integral of this potential, $\\int V(r) d^3r$. Since the potential is central, i.e., it depends only on the magnitude $r=|\\vec{r}|$, we can switch to spherical coordinates for the integration:\n$$\n\\int V(r) d^3r = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\int_0^\\infty r^2 V(r) \\, dr = 4\\pi \\int_0^\\infty r^2 V(r) \\, dr\n$$\nSubstituting the form of $V(r)$:\n$$\n\\int V(r) d^3r = 4\\pi \\int_0^\\infty r^2 \\left( V_{c}\\,\\theta(r_{c}-r) - V_{a}\\,\\frac{\\exp(-\\mu r)}{r} \\right) dr\n$$\nThis integral can be separated into two parts, one for the repulsive core and one for the attractive Yukawa term:\n$$\n\\int V(r) d^3r = 4\\pi V_{c} \\int_0^\\infty r^2 \\theta(r_c-r) \\, dr - 4\\pi V_{a} \\int_0^\\infty r^2 \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu r)}{r} \\, dr\n$$\nThe first integral, for the repulsive part, simplifies due to the Heaviside function, which restricts the integration range to $0 \\le r \\le r_c$:\n$$\n4\\pi V_{c} \\int_0^{r_c} r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi V_{c} \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_0^{r_c} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} V_{c} r_{c}^3\n$$\nThe second integral, for the attractive part, simplifies to:\n$$\n-4\\pi V_{a} \\int_0^\\infty r \\exp(-\\mu r) \\, dr\n$$\nThis is a standard integral, which can be evaluated using integration by parts or by recognizing it as related to the Gamma function. Let $I = \\int_0^\\infty r \\exp(-\\mu r) \\, dr$. Using integration by parts, let $u=r$ and $dv = \\exp(-\\mu r)dr$. Then $du=dr$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\exp(-\\mu r)$.\n$$\nI = \\left[ -\\frac{r}{\\mu} \\exp(-\\mu r) \\right]_0^\\infty - \\int_0^\\infty \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\exp(-\\mu r) \\right) dr = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\mu r) dr = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\exp(-\\mu r) \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{\\mu^2}\n$$\nSo, the contribution from the attractive term is $-\\frac{4\\pi V_{a}}{\\mu^2}$.\n\nCombining the results for the repulsive and attractive parts, the total spatial integral of the potential is:\n$$\n\\int V(r) d^3r = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} V_{c} r_{c}^3 - \\frac{4\\pi V_{a}}{\\mu^2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for the Hartree potential energy density:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{H}(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho^2 \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{3} V_{c} r_{c}^3 - \\frac{4\\pi V_{a}}{\\mu^2} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final form for the Hartree potential energy density as a function of the model parameters and the total nucleon density $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{H}(\\rho) = 2\\pi \\rho^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} V_{c} r_{c}^3 - \\frac{V_{a}}{\\mu^2} \\right)\n$$\nFor symmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature with a spin-isospin independent potential, the Hartree energy density is independent of the spin-isospin degeneracy $\\gamma$, as it treats all nucleons as an indistinguishable classical fluid.\n\nNext, we address how the exchange (Fock) contribution would qualitatively modify this result. The Fock energy arises from the antisymmetrization of the many-body wave function, as required by the Pauli exclusion principle for identical fermions. It is a purely quantum mechanical effect neglected in the Hartree approximation. For a central, spin-isospin independent interaction in symmetric nuclear matter, the Fock term introduces the following qualitative modifications:\n\n$1$. **Dependence on Spin-Isospin Degeneracy ($\\gamma$)**: The exchange interaction occurs only between identical particles. In symmetric nuclear matter, a nucleon of a given spin and isospin projection can only exchange with other nucleons of the same spin and isospin. There are $\\gamma=4$ such species (spin-up protons, spin-down protons, spin-up neutrons, spin-down neutrons). The density of each species is $\\rho_s = \\rho/\\gamma$. While the direct (Hartree) term involves interactions between all pairs of particles and is proportional to $\\rho^2$, the exchange (Fock) term involves only pairs of identical particles. The number of such pairs is proportional to $\\gamma (\\rho/\\gamma)^2 = \\rho^2/\\gamma$. Consequently, the magnitude of the Fock energy is suppressed by a factor of roughly $1/\\gamma$ compared to the Hartree energy, for a similar interaction strength. For nuclear matter with $\\gamma=4$, this is a significant reduction.\n\n$2$. **Dependence on Momentum-Space Form Factor**: The Hartree energy density $\\varepsilon_{H}$ depends on the potential $V(r)$ only through its volume integral, $\\int V(r) d^3r$. This integral is equal to the Fourier transform of the potential evaluated at zero momentum transfer, $\\tilde{V}(q=0)$. The Fock energy density, in contrast, is not determined by a single point of the momentum-space potential. It involves a convolution of the momentum-space potential with the occupied momentum states of the nucleons. This can be expressed as an average of $\\tilde{V}(q)$ over the range of possible momentum transfers $q = |\\vec{k}_1 - \\vec{k}_2|$, where $\\vec{k}_1$ and $\\vec{k}_2$ are the momenta of the exchanging nucleons. In a Fermi gas at zero temperature, these momenta are within the Fermi sphere ($|\\vec{k}| \\le k_F$), so $q$ ranges from $0$ to $2k_F$. Therefore, the Fock term is sensitive to the full momentum-space structure of the interaction, $\\tilde{V}(q)$, and not just its value at $q=0$. This makes the exchange interaction non-local in coordinate space and introduces a non-trivial momentum dependence to the single-particle potential, which is crucial for a more realistic description of nuclear matter properties like saturation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\pi \\rho^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} V_{c} r_{c}^3 - \\frac{V_{a}}{\\mu^2} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "3607183"}, {"introduction": "While microscopic potentials are fundamental, much of modern nuclear structure theory relies on phenomenological energy density functionals (EDFs) that are carefully designed to reproduce known nuclear properties.

The kinetic energy term ($\\propto \\rho^{2/3}$) is repulsive. The $t_{0}$ term is typically attractive ($t_{0}  0$, giving a contribution $\\propto \\rho$). The momentum-dependent terms ($t_{1}, t_{2}$) are repulsive ($\\propto \\rho^{5/3}$). The term proportional to $t_{3}$ contributes an energy term $\\propto t_{3}\\rho^{\\alpha+1}$. For typical Skyrme forces, $t_{3}  0$ and $\\alpha  0$. This term provides a strong repulsion that grows rapidly with density. This is crucial for two reasons:\n1.  It provides the necessary \"stiffness\" to the nuclear matter at high densities, preventing it from collapsing and ensuring a saturation minimum exists.\n2.  The presence of two adjustable parameters, $t_{3}$ and $\\alpha$, gives crucial flexibility to simultaneously reproduce the empirical saturation density ($\\rho_0 \\approx 0.16\\,\\text{fm}^{-3}$), saturation energy ($E/A(\\rho_0) \\approx -16\\,\\text{MeV}$), and the nuclear incompressibility modulus, $K_{0}$, which is related to the second derivative.\n\n### Expression for the Normalized Energy $\\Phi_{0}$\n\nWe are asked to find $\\Phi_{0} \\equiv \\frac{E/A(\\rho_{0})}{E_{kin}(\\rho_{0})}$, where $E_{kin}(\\rho_{0}) = \\frac{3}{5}\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}k_{F,0}^{2} = \\frac{3\\hbar^{2}}{10m}\\left(\\frac{3\\pi^{2}\\rho_{0}}{2}\\right)^{2/3}$.

For $\\alpha0$, $m^*(\\rho)$ decreases with $\\rho$, which increases $T(\\rho)$ at fixed $k_F$ and generally stiffens the kinetic contribution, making $K_{\\text{kin}}$ larger in magnitude. \n- The explicit momentum-dependent mean field through $c\\,x\\,f(k_F)$ contributes to $V(\\rho)$ with derivatives governed by $f'(\\rho)$ and $f''(\\rho)$, where $f(\\rho)$ depends on the curvature of $Y(\\rho)$ with respect to $\\rho$. Increasing $c$ and decreasing $\\Lambda$ generally enhance the curvature of $V(\\rho)$ with respect to $\\rho$, tending to increase $\\lvert K_{\\text{pot}}\\rvert$ and, depending on the sign, stiffen or soften the total incompressibility. Because the calibration enforces $P(\\rho_0)=0$ and $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_0)=-16\\,\\text{MeV}$ for each parameter set, changes in $\\alpha$ and $c$ are compensated by $a$ and $b$ at the level of the equation of state near $\\rho_0$, isolating their specific impact on the curvature captured in $K_{\\text{kin}}$ and $K_{\\text{pot}}$.\n\nThe provided program encodes these derivations exactly and returns the required triplets for the specified test suite, in $\\text{MeV}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants in stated units\nHBARC = 197.3269804  # MeV*fm\nM_N = 939.0          # MeV\nRHO0 = 0.16          # fm^{-3}\nE0_BIND = -16.0      # MeV\n\n# Convenience: constant prefactor for kinetic energy T = C_T * Y / m*\nC_T = (3.0/5.0) * (HBARC**2) / 2.0  # MeV*fm^2\n\ndef kF(rho):\n    # Fermi momentum for symmetric NM: k_F = (3π^2 ρ / 2)^(1/3)\n    return (1.5 * np.pi**2 * rho) ** (1.0/3.0)\n\ndef Y_and_derivs(rho):\n    # Y = kF^2, dY/dρ, d^2Y/dρ^2 from analytic power laws\n    k = kF(rho)\n    Y = k*k\n    dY = (2.0/3.0) * Y / rho\n    d2Y = -(2.0/9.0) * Y / (rho**2)\n    return Y, dY, d2Y\n\ndef mstar_and_derivs(rho, alpha):\n    x = rho / RHO0\n    g = 1.0 + alpha * x\n    mstar = M_N / g\n    dm = - M_N * alpha / (RHO0 * g * g)\n    d2m = 2.0 * M_N * (alpha**2) / (RHO0**2 * g**3)\n    return mstar, dm, d2m\n\ndef T_and_derivs(rho, alpha):\n    Y, dY, d2Y = Y_and_derivs(rho)\n    mstar, dm, d2m = mstar_and_derivs(rho, alpha)\n    # T = C_T * Y / m*\n    T = C_T * Y / mstar\n    dT = C_T * ( (dY / mstar) - (Y * dm) / (mstar**2) )\n    d2T = C_T * (\n        (d2Y / mstar)\n        - 2.0 * (dY * dm) / (mstar**2)\n        - (Y * d2m) / (mstar**2)\n        + 2.0 * Y * (dm**2) / (mstar**3)\n    )\n    return T, dT, d2T\n\ndef f_and_derivs(rho, Lambda):\n    # f = Y / (Y + Lambda^2)\n    Y, dY, d2Y = Y_and_derivs(rho)\n    B = Lambda**2\n    denom = Y + B\n    f = Y / denom\n    df = B * dY / (denom**2)\n    d2f = B * ( d2Y / (denom**2) - 2.0 * (dY**2) / (denom**3) )\n    return f, df, d2f\n\ndef calibrate_a_b(alpha, sigma, c, Lambda):\n    rho = RHO0\n    # Kinetic at saturation\n    T0, dT0, _ = T_and_derivs(rho, alpha)\n    # Momentum-dependent potential piece at saturation\n    f0, df0, _ = f_and_derivs(rho, Lambda)\n    # Solve linear system from binding and zero-pressure conditions:\n    # a + b + c f0 = E0_BIND - T0\n    # dT0 + a/RHO0 + (b*sigma)/RHO0 + c ( f0/RHO0 + df0 ) = 0\n    # Derived analytic solution for sigma != 1:\n    b = - ( RHO0 * dT0 + E0_BIND - T0 + RHO0 * c * df0 ) / (sigma - 1.0)\n    a = E0_BIND - T0 - c * f0 - b\n    return a, b\n\ndef V_derivs_at_rho(rho, alpha, sigma, c, Lambda, a, b):\n    # Compute dV/dρ and d^2V/dρ^2 at rho\n    x = rho / RHO0\n    f, df, d2f = f_and_derivs(rho, Lambda)\n    # dV\n    dV = (a / RHO0) + (b * sigma * x**(sigma - 1.0) / RHO0) + c * ( (1.0 / RHO0) * f + x * df )\n    # d2V\n    d2V = (b * sigma * (sigma - 1.0) * x**(sigma - 2.0) / (RHO0**2)) + c * ( 2.0 * (1.0 / RHO0) * df + x * d2f )\n    return dV, d2V\n\ndef incompressibility_components(alpha, sigma, c, Lambda):\n    # Calibrate a and b at saturation\n    a, b = calibrate_a_b(alpha, sigma, c, Lambda)\n    rho = RHO0\n    # Kinetic parts\n    _, dT, d2T = T_and_derivs(rho, alpha)\n    K_kin = 9.0 * ( 2.0 * rho * dT + rho**2 * d2T )\n    # Potential parts\n    dV, d2V = V_derivs_at_rho(rho, alpha, sigma, c, Lambda, a, b)\n    K_pot = 9.0 * ( 2.0 * rho * dV + rho**2 * d2V )\n    # Total\n    K_tot = K_kin + K_pot\n    return K_tot, K_kin, K_pot\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case: (alpha, sigma, c, Lambda)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 1.5),\n        (0.5, 2.0, 0.0, 1.5),\n        (0.0, 1.5, 25.0, 1.8),\n        (0.5, 1.5, 25.0, 1.8),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for alpha, sigma, c, Lambda in test_cases:\n        K_tot, K_kin, K_pot = incompressibility_components(alpha, sigma, c, Lambda)\n        results.append([K_tot, K_kin, K_pot])\n\n    # Format results rounded to three decimals, no spaces, single line.\n    def fmt_triplet(trip):\n        return \"[\" + \",\".join(f\"{x:.3f}\" for x in trip) + \"]\"\n\n    output = \"[\" + \",\".join(fmt_triplet(trip) for trip in results) + \"]\"\n    print(output)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "3607178"}]}
