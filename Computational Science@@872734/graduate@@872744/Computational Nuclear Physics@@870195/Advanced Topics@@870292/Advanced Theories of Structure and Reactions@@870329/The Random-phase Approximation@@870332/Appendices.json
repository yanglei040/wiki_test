We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of two quantities within the Random-Phase Approximation (RPA) for a simplified model of an even-even nucleus. The model consists of a single degenerate particle-hole ($ph$) branch of energy $\\Delta$ and a separable residual interaction $V=\\kappa D^{\\dagger} D$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the RPA Collective Frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{RPA}}$**\n\nFirst, we establish the non-interacting retarded response function, $\\chi_{0}(\\omega)$, at zero temperature. In the spectral Lehmann representation, it is given by:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\omega) = \\sum_{n \\neq 0} \\left( \\frac{|\\langle n | D | 0 \\rangle|^2}{\\hbar\\omega - (E_n - E_0) + i\\eta} - \\frac{|\\langle 0 | D | n \\rangle|^2}{\\hbar\\omega + (E_n - E_0) - i\\eta} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $|0\\rangle$ is the ground state, $|n\\rangle$ are the excited states, and $\\eta \\to 0^+$. In an independent-particle description, the elementary excitations are of particle-hole type, so we set $|n\\rangle \\to |ph\\rangle$ and $E_n - E_0 \\to E_p - E_h$. The matrix elements become $|\\langle ph | D | 0 \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle p | D | h \\rangle|^2$. Assuming the operator $D$ is such that the forward- and backward-going contributions to the strength are equal, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\omega) = \\sum_{ph} |\\langle p | D | h \\rangle|^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - (E_p - E_h) + i\\eta} - \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega + (E_p - E_h) - i\\eta} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a single, degenerate $ph$ branch, which allows us to replace the individual particle-hole energies $E_p - E_h$ with a single energy $\\Delta$. The total unperturbed strength is given as $S \\equiv \\sum_{ph} |\\langle p|D|h\\rangle|^{2}$.
