[@problem_id:3602133]", "problem": "Consider the formation of a compound nucleus in a Hauser-Feshbach (HF) calculation for neutron-induced reactions within the optical model framework. A spin-$s_a$ projectile is incident on a target of spin $I_A$, and the entrance-channel population of compound spin and parity $J,\\pi$ at center-of-mass energy $E$ is to be constructed from the optical-model scattering matrix. Work in the limit where direct-reaction couplings can be neglected so that the absorption encoded by the optical potential represents compound nucleus formation.\n\nIn this problem, take a neutron projectile with spin $s_a = \\tfrac{1}{2}$ and positive intrinsic parity, incident on a spin-zero even-even target with $I_A = 0$ and positive intrinsic parity. Hence the only channel spin is $s = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, and the compound parity is $\\pi = (-1)^{\\ell}$. The entrance-channel optical-model $S$-matrix is diagonal in the $(\\ell,j)$ basis at the given energy $E$, and the transmission coefficient in a partial wave is related to the optical-model scattering matrix by $T_{\\ell j}(E) = 1 - |S_{\\ell j}(E)|^{2}$.

The probability of forming a compound nucleus with a specific total angular momentum $J$ and parity $\\pi$ is proportional to the sum of the reaction cross sections for all entrance channels that can populate this state. The reaction cross section for a given entrance channel partial wave, characterized by orbital angular momentum $\\ell$ and total single-particle angular momentum $j$, is given by the optical model as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\ell j}^{\\text{reac}}(E) = \\pi \\lambda^2 g_j T_{\\ell j}(E)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the reduced de Broglie wavelength of the incident particle, $T_{\\ell j}(E)$ is the transmission coefficient for that partial wave, and $g_j$ is the spin statistical factor. The statistical factor is given by:\n$$\ng_j = \\frac{2j+1}{(2s_a+1)(2I_A+1)}\n$$\nIn this problem, the projectile is a neutron with spin $s_a = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the target is a spin-zero nucleus with $I_A=0$. Therefore, the statistical factor becomes:\n$$\ng_j = \\frac{2j+1}{(2(\\frac{1}{2})+1)(2(0)+1)} = \\frac{2j+1}{2}\n$$\nThe unnormalized entrance-channel formation weight, $W(J^\\pi)$, for a compound state $(J, \\pi)$ is proportional to the sum of the reaction cross sections of all contributing channels. When normalizing to find the population distribution $P(J^\\pi)$, the common factors $\\pi \\lambda^2$ and the denominator $2$ from $g_j$ will cancel. Thus, we can define the unnormalized weight as being proportional to the sum of $(2j+1)T_{\\ell j}$ over all contributing channels.\n\nThe quantum numbers of the compound nucleus, $(J, \\pi)$, are determined by angular momentum and parity conservation laws. The total angular momentum is given by the vector sum $\\vec{J} = \\vec{I_A} + \\vec{j}$. Since $I_A=0$, we have $\\vec{J} = \\vec{j}$, which implies that the compound nucleus spin $J$ is identical to the single-particle total angular momentum $j$. The parity of the compound nucleus is the product of the intrinsic parities of the projectile and target and the orbital parity factor $(-1)^\\ell$. Given that both the neutron (projectile) and the even-even target have positive intrinsic parity, the compound nucleus parity is $\\pi = (+1)(+1)(-1)^\\ell = (-1)^\\ell$.\n\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between an entrance channel $(\\ell, j)$ and the compound nucleus state $(J=j, \\pi=(-1)^\\ell)$ it populates.
