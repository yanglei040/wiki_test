This correction is defined as the sum of two terms: the vacuum-polarization (Uehling) correction and the magnetic-moment interaction correction.\n\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\equiv \\left|\\frac{V_U(r_0)}{V_C(r_0)}\\right| + \\frac{|V_{MM}(r_0)|}{E_{\\mathrm{cm}}}\n$$\n\nThe calculation is performed in three steps: (1) determine the kinematic quantities, (2) compute the Uehling correction, and (3) compute the magnetic-moment correction. Natural units ($\\hbar = c = 1$) are used throughout.\n\n**1. Kinematic Quantities**\n\nFirst, we determine the center-of-mass energy $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}$. For a projectile hitting a stationary target of equal mass, the center-of-mass energy is half the laboratory kinetic energy.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{lab}}}{2} = \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}{2} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\n\nThe reduced mass $\\mu$ for a two-proton system is half the proton mass $m_p$.

The theoretical foundation for this comparison is Levinson's theorem.\n\nLevinson's theorem provides a fundamental connection between the low-energy behavior of scattering phase shifts and the number of bound states a potential can support. For a short-ranged, central potential $V(r)$ that is less singular than $1/r^2$ at the origin, and under the assumption that there are no zero-energy bound states (or \"half-bound states\"), the theorem for a given partial wave with angular momentum quantum number $l$ is expressed as:\n$$\n\\delta_{l}(0) - \\delta_{l}(\\infty) = n_{l}\\pi\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_l(k)$ is the phase shift as a function of the wave number $k$, $n_l$ is the number of bound states for that partial wave, and the phase shifts are measured in radians.\n\nThe problem provides all the necessary information to test this relationship. It gives analytic models for the phase shifts $\\delta_l(k)$ for $l=0, 1, 2$, the number of bound states $n_l$ for each channel, and the high-energy limit of the phase shifts.\n\nThe consistency metric $M$ is defined as the sum of the squared deviations from Levinson's theorem for each partial wave:\n$$\nM = \\sum_{l=0}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{l}(0)-\\delta_{l}(\\infty)}{\\pi}-n_{l}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nA perfectly consistent model, where the scattering and bound-state calculations are in exact agreement, would yield $M=0$.\n\nWe must first determine the values of $\\delta_l(0)$ and $\\delta_l(\\infty)$ for each partial wave $l \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe given phase-shift models are:\n$$\n\\delta_{0}(k) = 3.12\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{k}{1.5}\\right)^{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{1}(k) = 0.05\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{k}{1.0}\\right)^{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{2}(k) = 0.01\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{k}{0.8}\\right)^{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem explicitly states the high-energy limit is $\\delta_{l}(k\\to\\infty) \\to 0$. This is consistent with the given analytic forms, as the exponential term in each function approaches zero as $k \\to \\infty$. Thus, for all three partial waves, we have:\n$$\n\\delta_{l}(\\infty) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } l = 0, 1, 2\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the low-energy limit ($k=0$) for each phase shift:\nFor $l=0$:\n$$\n\\delta_{0}(0) = 3.12\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{0}{1.5}\\right)^{2}\\right) = 3.12\\,\\exp(0) = 3.12\n$$\nFor $l=1$:\n$$\n\\delta_{1}(0) = 0.05\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{0}{1.0}\\right)^{2}\\right) = 0.05\\,\\exp(0) = 0.05\n$$\nFor $l=2$:\n$$\n\\delta_{2}(0) = 0.01\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{0}{0.8}\\right)^{2}\\right) = 0.01\\,\\exp(0) = 0.01\n$$\nThe numbers of bound states are given as:\n$$\nn_{0} = 1\n$$\n$$\nn_{1} = 0\n$$\n$$\nn_{2} = 0\n$$\nNow we can compute the individual terms in the sum for $M$.\n\nFor the $l=0$ partial wave:\nThe term is $\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{0}(0)-\\delta_{0}(\\infty)}{\\pi}-n_{0}\\right)^{2}$. Substituting the values:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{3.12 - 0}{\\pi} - 1\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{3.12}{\\pi} - 1\\right)^{2}\n$$\nFor the $l=1$ partial wave:\nThe term is $\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{1}(0)-\\delta_{1}(\\infty)}{\\pi}-n_{1}\\right)^{2}$. Substituting the values:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{0.05 - 0}{\\pi} - 0\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{0.05}{\\pi}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nFor the $l=2$ partial wave:\nThe term is $\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{2}(0)-\\delta_{2}(\\infty)}{\\pi}-n_{2}\\right)^{2}$. Substituting the values:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{0.01 - 0}{\\pi} - 0\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{0.01}{\\pi}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThe total metric $M$ is the sum of these three terms:\n$$\nM = \\left(\\frac{3.12}{\\pi} - 1\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{0.05}{\\pi}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{0.01}{\\pi}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nNow, we perform the numerical evaluation using a value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265$.\nFirst term ($l=0$):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{3.12}{3.14159265} - 1\\right)^{2} \\approx (0.99312678 - 1)^{2} = (-0.00687322)^{2} \\approx 4.72410 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nSecond term ($l=1$):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{0.05}{3.14159265}\\right)^{2} \\approx (0.01591549)^{2} \\approx 2.53303 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nThird term ($l=2$):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{0.01}{3.14159265}\\right)^{2} \\approx (0.00318310)^{2} \\approx 1.01321 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nSumming these values to find $M$:\n$$\nM \\approx 4.72410 \\times 10^{-5} + 2.53303 \\times 10^{-4} + 1.01321 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\n$$\nM \\approx 0.472410 \\times 10^{-4} + 2.53303 \\times 10^{-4} + 0.101321 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n$$\nM \\approx (0.472410 + 2.53303 + 0.101321) \\times 10^{-4} = 3.106761 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
