A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution consists of three parts: first, the derivation of the canonical occupation probability; second, an explanation of its modification under quasiparticle blocking; and third, a numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Occupation Probability $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$**\n\nIn the BCS limit of the HFB theory, the HFB matrix $\\mathcal{H}$ is block-diagonal in the canonical basis. Each block corresponds to a pair of time-reversed states, which we denote by $(\\alpha, \\bar{\\alpha})$. The basis for each $2 \\times 2$ block is spanned by the particle creation and annihilation operators, which can be written in the Nambu-Gor'kov space as $(c_{\\alpha}^{\\dagger}, c_{\\bar{\\alpha}})$. The corresponding HFB matrix block is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda & \\Delta_{\\alpha} \\\\ \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{*} & -(\\epsilon_{\\bar{\\alpha}} - \\lambda) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$ is the canonical single-particle energy, $\\lambda$ is the chemical potential, and $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$ is the pairing gap which couples states $\\alpha$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}$. In the standard canonical basis with time-reversal symmetry, we have $\\epsilon_{\\alpha} = \\epsilon_{\\bar{\\alpha}}$. We can also choose a phase convention such that $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$ is real and positive, so $\\Delta_{\\alpha}^{*} = \\Delta_{\\alpha}$. The matrix simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda & \\Delta_{\\alpha} \\\\ \\Delta_{\\alpha} & -(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe HFB problem is solved by diagonalizing this matrix to find the quasiparticle energies $E_{\\alpha}$ and the corresponding eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha} - E \\cdot I) = 0$:\n$$\n(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda - E)(-\\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda - E) - \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-((\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) + E)((\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) - E) - \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-((\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} - E^{2}) - \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nE^{2} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} - \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2} = 0 \\implies E^{2} = (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} + \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}\n$$\nThe quasiparticle energies are the positive eigenvalues, $E_{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} + \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}}$, which matches the expression given in the problem.\n\nThe eigenvectors of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha}$ define the Bogoliubov transformation. Let the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $E_{\\alpha}$ be $\\begin{pmatrix} u_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix}$. The coefficients $u_{\\alpha}$ and $v_{\\alpha}$ are the amplitudes of the Bogoliubov transformation that connects particle operators to quasiparticle operators. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda & \\Delta_{\\alpha} \\\\ \\Delta_{\\alpha} & -(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix} = E_{\\alpha} \\begin{pmatrix} u_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n1. $(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) u_{\\alpha} + \\Delta_{\\alpha} v_{\\alpha} = E_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha}$\n2. $\\Delta_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) v_{\\alpha} = E_{\\alpha} v_{\\alpha}$\n\nTo find the relationship between the coefficients, we can use either equation. Let's rearrange the second equation:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha} = (E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) v_{\\alpha}\n$$\nAnd from the first equation:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\alpha} v_{\\alpha} = (E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda) u_{\\alpha}\n$$\nTo find $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$, we also use the normalization condition for the transformation, $u_{\\alpha}^{2} + v_{\\alpha}^{2} = 1$. Let us equate expressions for the product $\\Delta_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha}v_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) = u_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda)\n$$\nSubstitute $u_{\\alpha}^{2} = 1 - v_{\\alpha}^{2}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) = (1 - v_{\\alpha}^{2})(E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda)\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) = E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda - v_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda)\n$$\nGroup terms with $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}[(E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) + (E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda)] = E_{\\alpha} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}[2E_{\\alpha}] = E_{\\alpha} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)\n$$\nSolving for $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$ yields the desired relation:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{E_{\\alpha} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)}{2E_{\\alpha}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda}{E_{\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nThe quantity $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$ is the occupation probability of the canonical single-particle state $\\alpha$ in the HFB (or BCS) vacuum. By substituting the definition of $E_{\\alpha}$, we obtain the full expression in terms of $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$, $\\lambda$, and $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda}{\\sqrt{(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} + \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}}}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Quasiparticle Blocking in Odd Nuclei**\n\nAn odd-mass nucleus has an odd number of nucleons. In the quasiparticle framework, this system can be described as a single quasiparticle excitation on top of a fully paired even-even core. This is the essence of quasiparticle blocking.\n\nIf we designate the blocked orbital by $b$, the ground state of the odd nucleus is described as $|\\Psi_{\\text{odd}}\\rangle = \\beta_{b}^{\\dagger}|\\Phi_{\\text{even}}\\rangle$, where $|\\Phi_{\\text{even}}\\rangle$ is the HFB vacuum of the even-even core (which may be variationally readjusted) and $\\beta_{b}^{\\dagger}$ is the creation operator for a quasiparticle in state $b$.\n\nThe consequence of blocking is that the orbital $b$ and its time-reversed partner $\\bar{b}$ are excluded from the pairing correlations that define the vacuum.\n\n- **Unblocked Orbitals ($\\alpha \\neq b, \\bar{b}$):** These orbitals continue to participate in pairing. Their behavior is described by the same BCS-like formalism derived in Part 1. They form Cooper pairs, and their occupation probability in the correlated ground state is given by the formula $v_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - (\\epsilon'_{\\alpha} - \\lambda')/E'_{\\alpha})$. The primes indicate that the mean-field energies $\\epsilon'_{\\alpha}$, chemical potential $\\lambda'$, and pairing gaps $\\Delta'_{\\alpha}$ are determined self-consistently for the odd system and may differ slightly from those of the neighbouring even-even nucleus due to the presence of the odd nucleon.\n\n- **Blocked Orbital ($b$):** The blocking of orbital $b$ means the pairing channel $(b, \\bar{b})$ is broken. The occupation number for the state $b$ in the one-quasiparticle state $|\\Psi_{\\text{odd}}\\rangle$ becomes exactly $1$. Correspondingly, the occupation of its time-reversed partner $\\bar{b}$ becomes $0$.\nAt the level of the one-body density matrix $\\rho$ and the pairing tensor $\\kappa$, whose elements in the canonical basis are $\\rho_{\\alpha\\alpha} = v_{\\alpha}^{2}$ and $\\kappa_{\\alpha\\bar{\\alpha}} = -u_{\\alpha}v_{\\alpha}$ for the even-even vacuum, the blocking imposes the following structure for the orbital pair $(b, \\bar{b})$:\n- **Occupation:** The occupation of the blocked orbital is fixed: $\\rho_{bb} = 1$. The occupation of its time-reversed partner is $\\rho_{\\bar{b}\\bar{b}} = 0$.\n- **Pairing Tensor:** Since there is no Cooper pair involving the blocked orbital, its contribution to the pairing tensor vanishes: $\\kappa_{b\\bar{b}} = 0$.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the occupation probability $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$ for an *unblocked* canonical orbital $\\alpha$ with the given parameters:\n- $\\epsilon_{\\alpha} = -7.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$\n- $\\lambda = -8.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$\n- $\\Delta_{\\alpha} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$\n\nFirst, we compute the difference $\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda = (-7.0) - (-8.0) = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\nNext, we compute the quasiparticle energy $E_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nE_{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} + \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}} = \\sqrt{(1.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^{2} + (1.2\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{1.0 + 1.44}\\,\\mathrm{MeV} = \\sqrt{2.44}\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\nNow, we use the derived formula for $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda}{E_{\\alpha}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\sqrt{2.44}\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}\\right)\n$$\nThe value is dimensionless, as expected for a probability.\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1.0}{\\sqrt{2.44}}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1.0}{1.5620499}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (1 - 0.6401844) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.3598156) \\approx 0.1799078\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} \\approx 0.1799\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1799}\n$$", "id": "3584879"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract theory to practical application, a common challenge is to identify which of the calculated quasiparticle states corresponds to the specific nucleon we intend to block, especially in deformed nuclei where good quantum numbers are lost.

We will analyze each option against the four specified criteria.\n\n**Criterion (iv): Equal footing for U and V components**\nA quasiparticle is a superposition of particle and hole excitations. A valid weight must account for both contributions. This means the expression should symmetrically involve both $\\lvert U_{ak} \\rvert^2$ and $\\lvert V_{ak} \\rvert^2$.\n\n**Criterion (iii): Phase-insensitivity**\nThe weight should be a real, non-negative quantity, typically involving absolute squares of complex amplitudes, making it insensitive to arbitrary phase choices in the wavefunctions.\n\n**Criterion (ii): Normalization**\nThe total weight of a given quasiparticle $k$ distributed over a complete orthonormal set of spherical states $\\{\\lvert s \\rangle\\}$ must sum to unity, i.e., $\\sum_s w_{k,s} = 1$.\n\n**Criterion (i): First-principles basis**\nThe expression must be derivable from the fundamental definitions of the quantities involved.\n\nLet's evaluate each option.\n\n**Option B:** $w_{k,s} \\;=\\; \\displaystyle \\sum_a \\lvert S_{a,s} \\rvert^2 \\, \\lvert U_{ak} \\rvert^2$\nThis expression only includes the particle amplitudes $U_{ak}$ and completely ignores the hole amplitudes $V_{ak}$.

The quantity $\\lvert S_{a,s} \\rvert^2 = \\lvert \\langle a | s \\rangle \\rvert^2$ is the probability that the spherical state $\\lvert s \\rangle$ is found in the deformed state $\\lvert a \\rangle$. The expression for $w_{k,s}$ is therefore a weighted sum, where the contribution of each deformed state to the quasiparticle is weighted by its importance for the target spherical state. This can be more formally expressed as the expectation value of an operator representing the quasiparticle's structure in the state $\\lvert s \\rangle$. Define the operator $\\hat{O}_k = \\sum_a \\lvert a \\rangle (\\lvert U_{ak} \\rvert^2 + \\lvert V_{ak} \\rvert^2) \\langle a \\lvert$.

It is a well-formulated question about standard practices in computational nuclear theory. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of Principles\n\nA blocked HFB calculation for an odd nucleus is an iterative, self-consistent procedure. At each iteration, $k$, one solves the HFB equation for a given set of densities $(\\rho^{(k-1)}, \\kappa^{(k-1)})$ to obtain a new set of quasiparticle states and energies. A specific quasiparticle state must be chosen for blocking, which defines the new densities $(\\rho^{(k)}, \\kappa^{(k)})$ for the next iteration. This process is repeated until a fixed point is reached.\n\n**1. Convergence Criteria:**\nThe goal of the self-consistent-field (SCF) iteration is to find a stationary solution of the energy functional $E[\\rho, \\kappa]$ under the imposed constraints. This stationary point, or fixed point, is achieved when the input densities and fields of a given iteration produce output densities that are identical (within a numerical tolerance). Therefore, convergence criteria must monitor the stability of the fundamental quantities.\n- The total energy $E$ is a key global observable. A necessary condition for convergence is that the energy difference between successive iterations, $|E^{(k)} - E^{(k-1)}|$, becomes negligible.\n- The densities $\\rho$ and $\\kappa$, which are combined into the generalized density matrix $\\mathcal{R}$, define the state of the system completely at the mean-field level. The most robust convergence criterion is the stabilization of this density matrix. This is typically measured by a matrix norm of the difference, e.g., the Frobenius norm $\\|\\mathcal{R}^{(k)} - \\mathcal{R}^{(k-1)}\\|$.\n- The calculation is performed subject to constraints, such as holding the average particle number $\\langle \\hat{N}_\\tau \\rangle$ equal to the desired integer value $N_\\tau$. These constraints must be satisfied to within a specified tolerance at the converged solution.\n\nThese three conditions together—energy stability, density matrix stability, and satisfaction of constraints—provide a comprehensive and reliable test for convergence.\n\n**2. State Tracking at Avoided Crossings:**\nAn avoided crossing occurs when two quasiparticle states with the same quantum numbers approach each other in energy. Due to a non-zero coupling $\\delta(q)$, their energy levels repel, and their wave functions (i.e., the $U, V$ amplitudes) mix strongly and rapidly interchange character as the constraint $q$ is varied. A strategy that simply blocks the \"lowest energy state\" will incorrectly switch from following one diabatic configuration to another.\n\nTo maintain diabatic continuity (i.e., to follow a state based on its intrinsic character rather than its energy ordering), one must use a criterion that is insensitive to energy. The physical character of a quasiparticle state is encoded in its vector of amplitudes, $w_i = \\begin{pmatrix} U_i \\\\ V_i \\end{pmatrix}$. While these vectors rotate rapidly with respect to the constraint $q$ near a crossing, they change smoothly and minimally between successive self-consistency iterations at a *fixed* $q$.\n\nTherefore, the correct strategy is to identify the desired quasiparticle state at iteration $k$ as the one that has the largest similarity to the blocked state from the previous iteration, $k-1$. In a vector space, this similarity is measured by the scalar product (or inner product). The overlap between the quasiparticle state $j$ blocked at iteration $k-1$ and a candidate state $i$ at iteration $k$ is given by the scalar product of their state vectors:\n$$ O_{ij}^{(k)} = \\left\\langle w_j^{(k-1)} \\middle| w_i^{(k)} \\right\\rangle = \\left(w_j^{(k-1)}\\right)^\\dagger w_i^{(k)} = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\left( U_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} U_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} + V_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} V_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} \\right) $$\nTo track the state, one chooses the quasiparticle index $i$ at iteration $k$ that maximizes the absolute value of this overlap, $|O_{ij}^{(k)}|$, with the state $j$ that was blocked at iteration $k-1$. This \"maximum overlap\" criterion ensures that the calculation follows a consistent diabatic path.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Conclude convergence when the change in total energy $|E^{(k)}-E^{(k-1)}|$ is below a threshold $\\epsilon$, the norm $\\|\\mathcal{R}^{(k)}-\\mathcal{R}^{(k-1)}\\|$ is below a tolerance, and particle-number constraints $\\langle \\hat{N}_\\tau\\rangle=N_\\tau$ are satisfied within tolerance; avoid occupation switching by selecting at iteration $k$ the blocked quasiparticle as the one whose $U,V$ amplitudes maximize the overlap with the previously blocked quasiparticle at iteration $k-1$, i.e., maximize $O_{ij}^{(k)}=\\left|\\sum_\\alpha U_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} U_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*}+\\sum_\\alpha V_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} V_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*}\\right|$.**\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:** This part correctly lists the three essential components of a robust SCF convergence test: stability of the total energy, stability of the generalized density matrix, and satisfaction of physical constraints. This is the standard procedure.\n- **State Tracking Strategy:** This part describes the maximum overlap method. The provided formula for $O_{ij}^{(k)}$ is $| \\sum_\\alpha U_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} U_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} + \\sum_\\alpha V_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} V_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} |$. This is the absolute value of the scalar product $\\left(w_j^{(k-1)}\\right)^\\dagger w_i^{(k)}$, which correctly quantifies the similarity between the quasiparticle state vectors. Maximizing this overlap is the standard and correct method for diabatic state tracking.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately describes both the necessary convergence criteria and the robust state-tracking strategy.\n\n**B. Conclude convergence when all quasiparticle energies $E_i$ stop changing and are in strictly increasing order, and the blocked state’s occupation probability $v_i^2$ equals $1$; avoid occupation switching by always blocking the instantaneous lowest-energy quasiparticle, which by definition tracks the ground configuration through any avoided crossing.**\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:** Monitoring only the quasiparticle energies $E_i$ is insufficient; the densities and wave functions must also stabilize. The condition that energies are in `strictly increasing order` is not a convergence criterion and is false if degeneracies exist. The condition that the blocked state's occupation probability `v_i^2` equals $1$ is physically incorrect. The HFB formalism does not lead to this simple picture; $v_k^2$ refers to the occupation of a single-particle state $k$ by a pair in the vacuum, not the total occupation of a quasiparticle state.\n- **State Tracking Strategy:** This option proposes blocking the `instantaneous lowest-energy quasiparticle`. The problem statement itself correctly identifies this as a naive and flawed approach that fails at avoided crossings.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Both the convergence criteria and the state-tracking method are either incomplete, physically incorrect, or known to be problematic.\n\n**C. Conclude convergence when the functional derivatives $\\delta E/\\delta \\rho$ and $\\delta E/\\delta \\kappa$ vanish within tolerance and the generalized density matrix satisfies $\\mathcal{R}^2=\\mathcal{R}$; avoid occupation switching by adding a penalty that maximizes the energy separation $|E_1(q)-E_2(q)|$ near an avoided crossing to keep identities distinct.**\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:** The condition that the functional derivatives of the energy vanish is a formal statement of the variational principle, which is correct in spirit. However, the condition $\\mathcal{R}^2=\\mathcal{R}$ (idempotency) holds for the HFB *vacuum* state (an even-even nucleus), but it does not hold for the generalized density matrix describing a one-quasiparticle excited state, which is the case in a blocked calculation for an odd nucleus.\n- **State Tracking Strategy:** Adding a penalty term to the energy functional to artificially increase level separation is scientifically unsound. It changes the physical problem being solved. The goal is to find solutions for the *actual* Hamiltonian/energy functional, not a modified one. This approach avoids the tracking problem by altering the physics, which is not a valid strategy.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The convergence criteria include an invalid condition, and the state-tracking strategy is physically un-justified.\n\n**D. Conclude convergence when the norm of the gradient of the Routhian with respect to $\\rho$ and $\\kappa$ is below a tolerance and constraints are satisfied; avoid occupation switching by enforcing that the blocked $(U,V)$ state remains orthonormal to its previous-iteration self, which precludes mixing across avoided crossings because orthonormality forbids state identity changes.**\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:** Using the gradient of the a constrained functional (the Routhian in the case of a rotational constraint) is a valid formulation for finding stationary points, so this part is plausible.\n- **State Tracking Strategy:** This part is based on a severe misunderstanding of basic linear algebra. Enforcing orthonormality means forcing the inner product between the state at iteration $k$ and the state at iteration $k-1$ to be zero: $\\langle w^{(k-1)} | w^{(k)} \\rangle = 0$. This is the exact opposite of what is required. For state tracking, we need the vectors to be as parallel as possible, meaning their inner product should be close to $1$ (for normalized vectors). Forcing orthogonality would guarantee that the calculation jumps to a completely different, unrelated state at every single iteration.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The state-tracking strategy is nonsensical and contrary to the required principle of maximizing overlap.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3584900"}]}
