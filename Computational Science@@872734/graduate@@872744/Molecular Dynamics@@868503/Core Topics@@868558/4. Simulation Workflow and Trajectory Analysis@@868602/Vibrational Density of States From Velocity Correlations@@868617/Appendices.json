The provided data and parameters are physically realistic. Therefore, a reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the three tasks outlined in the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Discrete Spectral Density Estimator $S_{v}(\\omega_{k})$\n\nThe Vibrational Density of States (VDOS) is proportional to the spectral density $S_{v}(\\omega)$ of the Velocity Autocorrelation Function (VACF), $C_{v}(t)$. According to the Wiener–Khinchin theorem, the spectral density is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function:\n$$S_{v}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C_{v}(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt$$\nThe problem states that the VACF, $C_{v}(t)$, is an even function of time, i.e., $C_{v}(-t) = C_{v}(t)$. This property allows for a simplification of the Fourier transform. We can split the integral and use a change of variables ($t' = -t$):\n$$S_{v}(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{v}(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} C_{v}(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt$$\n$$S_{v}(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{v}(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{v}(-t') \\exp(i\\omega t') dt'$$\nSince $C_{v}(-t') = C_{v}(t')$, the expression becomes:\n$$S_{v}(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{v}(t) (\\exp(-i\\omega t) + \\exp(i\\omega t)) dt$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\exp(ix) + \\exp(-ix) = 2\\cos(x)$, we obtain the real-valued Fourier cosine transform:\n$$S_{v}(\\omega) = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{v}(t) \\cos(\\omega t) dt$$\nTo compute this from a discrete, finite-duration MD trajectory, we must introduce two approximations:\n1.  A discrete estimator for the VACF, $C[n]$, based on the sampled velocities.\n2.  A numerical approximation of the integral over the finite observation window.\n\nFirst, we derive the estimator $C[n]$ for $C_{v}(t_n)$ where $t_n = n\\Delta t$. The problem defines $C_{v}(t) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{i}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{i}(t) \\rangle$. For an ergodic system, the ensemble average $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ can be replaced by a time average over the simulation trajectory. Given $M$ velocity samples $\\{\\mathbf{v}_{i}(t_{m})\\}_{m=0}^{M-1}$, the time-averaged estimator for the VACF at a lag time $t_n = n\\Delta t$ is:\n$$C[n] = \\frac{1}{N(M-n)} \\sum_{m=0}^{M-n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{v}_{i}(t_m) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{i}(t_{m+n})$$\nThis estimator is defined for discrete lags $n = 0, 1, \\dots, M-1$.\n\nNext, we approximate the integral for $S_v(\\omega)$. We only have data over a total duration $T = M\\Delta t$, so the integral is truncated to the interval $[0, T]$. We approximate the integral using a left-hand Riemann sum with $M$ intervals of width $\\Delta t$:\n$$S_{v}(\\omega) \\approx 2 \\int_{0}^{T} C_{v}(t) \\cos(\\omega t) dt \\approx 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} C_{v}(n\\Delta t) \\cos(\\omega n\\Delta t) \\Delta t$$\nSubstituting the discrete estimator $C[n]$ for $C_v(n\\Delta t)$, we get:\n$$S_{v}(\\omega) \\approx 2 \\Delta t \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} C[n] \\cos(\\omega n\\Delta t)$$\nThe problem requires this to be evaluated on a discrete frequency grid $\\{\\omega_k\\}$ consistent with a length-$T$ periodic extension, which corresponds to the frequencies of an $M$-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). These angular frequencies are given by:\n$$\\omega_{k} = \\frac{2\\pi k}{T} = \\frac{2\\pi k}{M\\Delta t}, \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, \\dots, M-1$$\nSubstituting this into our approximation for $S_{v}(\\omega)$ yields the final expression for the discrete spectral density estimator $S_{v}(\\omega_{k})$:\n$$S_{v}(\\omega_{k}) = 2 \\Delta t \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} C[n] \\cos\\left(n\\Delta t \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi k}{M\\Delta t}\\right)$$\n$$S_{v}(\\omega_{k}) = 2 \\Delta t \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} C[n] \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi nk}{M}\\right)$$\nThis expression is explicitly real-valued and is expressed in terms of the required variables. It corresponds to $2\\Delta t$ times the real part of the $M$-point DFT of the one-sided VACF estimator $C[n]$.\n\n### Part 2: Aliasing Constraint and Frequency Resolution\n\nThe relationship between a continuous-time signal and its uniformly sampled discrete version is governed by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.\nThe sampling interval is given as $\\Delta t$. The sampling frequency is therefore $f_s = 1/\\Delta t$.\n\n**Aliasing Constraint ($\\omega_{\\max}$):** The theorem states that to perfectly reconstruct a continuous-time signal from its samples, the sampling frequency $f_s$ must be at least twice the maximum frequency component present in the signal. Conversely, if a signal is sampled at frequency $f_s$, the highest frequency that can be uniquely represented without aliasing is the Nyquist frequency, $f_{\\text{Nyquist}} = f_s / 2$. Any frequencies in the original signal above $f_{\\text{Nyquist}}$ will be folded back into the range $[0, f_{\\text{Nyquist}}]$, an effect known as aliasing.\nThe maximum non-aliased angular frequency, $\\omega_{\\max}$, is therefore:\n$$\\omega_{\\max} = 2\\pi f_{\\text{Nyquist}} = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{f_s}{2}\\right) = \\pi f_s = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta t}$$\n\n**Frequency Resolution ($\\Delta \\omega$):** The ability to resolve distinct frequencies in a spectrum is limited by the total observation time, $T$. The Fourier transform of a signal truncated to a duration $T$ results in a spectrum where the minimal separation between independent frequency components is $\\Delta f = 1/T$. In the context of the DFT of $M$ samples over a duration $T=M\\Delta t$, this separation corresponds to the spacing between adjacent frequency bins $\\omega_k$.\nThe angular frequency resolution, $\\Delta \\omega$, is:\n$$\\Delta \\omega = 2\\pi \\Delta f = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}$$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following parameters for a specific MD trajectory:\n- Sampling interval: $\\Delta t = 0.5 \\,\\text{fs} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-15} \\,\\text{s}$\n- Total duration: $T = 20 \\,\\text{ps} = 20 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{s}$\n\nUsing the expressions derived in Part 2, we can compute the numerical values for $\\Delta \\omega$ and $\\omega_{\\max}$.\n\n**Angular Frequency Resolution ($\\Delta \\omega$):**\n$$\\Delta \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T} = \\frac{2\\pi}{20 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{s}} = \\frac{\\pi}{10 \\times 10^{-12}} \\,\\text{rad/s} = \\pi \\times 10^{11} \\,\\text{rad/s}$$\nNumerically, this is $\\Delta \\omega \\approx 3.14159265 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\text{rad/s}$.
