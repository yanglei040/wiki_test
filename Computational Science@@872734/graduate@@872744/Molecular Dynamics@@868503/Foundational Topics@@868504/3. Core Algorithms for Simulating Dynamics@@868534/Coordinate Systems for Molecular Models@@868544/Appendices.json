The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Analysis of the Coordinate System\n\nA molecule with $N$ atoms is described by $3N$ Cartesian coordinates. For this triatomic molecule, $N=3$, so we begin with $3 \\times 3 = 9$ Cartesian coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^9$. The \"shape\" of the molecule is its geometry, independent of its position and orientation in space. These correspond to the \"gauge\" freedoms of global translation (3 degrees of freedom) and global rotation (3 degrees of freedom for a non-linear molecule). The group of these transformations is the special Euclidean group $SE(3)$.\n\nThe number of internal degrees of freedom that describe the shape of a non-linear molecule is therefore $3N - 6$. For a triatomic molecule ($N=3$), this is $3(3) - 6 = 3$. This is the dimension of the internal configuration space or \"shape space\".\n\nThe proposed coordinate set is $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$. It consists of $3$ parameters.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For any non-collinear triatomic configuration with labeled atoms, the internal coordinates $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ uniquely determine the molecular shape up to a global rigid motion; equivalently, any two Cartesian realizations sharing these values are related by a translation and a proper rotation.**\n\nThe internal coordinates $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ define a triangle with vertices at the locations of atoms $1, 2, 3$. The lengths of two sides are given directly as $r_{12}$ and $r_{23}$, and the angle between these two sides is $\\theta$. By the Law of Cosines, the length of the third side, $r_{13} = \\lVert \\mathbf{R}_1 - \\mathbf{R}_3 \\rVert$, is determined:\n$$r_{13}^2 = r_{12}^2 + r_{23}^2 - 2 r_{12} r_{23} \\cos\\theta$$\nThus, specifying $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ is equivalent to specifying the three side lengths $(r_{12}, r_{23}, r_{13})$. By the Side-Side-Side (SSS) or Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence theorems of Euclidean geometry, the shape of this triangle is uniquely determined.\n\nAny two triangles in three-dimensional space with identical side lengths are congruent. Congruence in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ means that one can be mapped onto the other by an isometry, which is a composition of a translation and an orthogonal transformation (an element of $O(3)$). The group $O(3)$ includes proper rotations (determinant $+1$, belonging to $SO(3)$) and improper rotations (determinant $-1$, e.g., reflections).\n\nThe statement claims uniqueness up to *proper* rotation and translation, i.e., transformation by an element of $SE(3)$. This is equivalent to asking if a triatomic molecule is chiral. A configuration is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed on the original by a proper rotation. A triatomic molecule is necessarily planar. Any planar figure is achiral. Its mirror image can always be superimposed onto the original by a proper rotation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For instance, a reflection through the molecular plane is the identity, while a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the molecular plane can be shown to be equivalent to a rotation of $\\pi$ radians about an axis in the molecular plane.\nTherefore, any two Cartesian realizations of the molecule with the same internal coordinates $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ are related by a translation and a proper rotation. The statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict on A: Correct**\n\n**B. The coordinate set $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ is not minimal; one must include $r_{13}$ to eliminate a discrete mirror ambiguity that remains if one uses only one angle.**\n\nThis statement makes two claims. Firstly, it claims the set is not minimal. As established, the number of internal degrees of freedom for a non-linear triatomic molecule is $3$. The set $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ has $3$ independent parameters for a non-collinear molecule. Thus, it is a minimal set. Including $r_{13}$ would make the set redundant (over-complete), as $r_{13}$ is a function of the other three coordinates.\nSecondly, it claims a \"discrete mirror ambiguity\" exists. As analyzed for option A, a triatomic molecule is planar and therefore achiral. There is no mirror ambiguity; the shape defined is unique up to proper rigid motions. This concern is relevant for chiral molecules (requiring at least $4$ atoms), where coordinates like dihedral angles are needed to distinguish enantiomers, but not for a triatomic system.\n\n**Verdict on B: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Counting degrees of freedom from Cartesian coordinates and factoring out the gauge group of global translations and rotations shows that a non-linear triatomic has $3$ internal degrees of freedom, so $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ is minimal.**\n\nThis statement presents the standard argument for the number of internal degrees of freedom. Starting with $N=3$ atoms, we have $3N=9$ Cartesian coordinates. The molecular shape is invariant under the $6$-dimensional Lie group $SE(3)$ of rigid motions (3 translations, 3 rotations). Therefore, the dimension of the space of molecular shapes (for non-linear molecules) is $3N-6 = 3(3)-6 = 3$. A coordinate set is minimal if it consists of this number of independent parameters. The set $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ contains $3$ parameters which are locally independent in the non-collinear case. The conclusion that the set is minimal is correct.\n\n**Verdict on C: Correct**\n\n**D. The residual gauge freedom is only global translation; global rotations are fixed by choosing the angle $\\theta$, so rotations are not a gauge in this coordinate set.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The internal coordinates $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta)$ are, by their very definition, scalars constructed from vector differences. They are manifestly invariant under both global translations ($\\mathbf{R}_i \\to \\mathbf{R}_i + \\mathbf{a}$) and global rotations ($\\mathbf{R}_i \\to Q\\mathbf{R}_i$ for $Q \\in SO(3)$). The angle $\\theta$ is one of the internal coordinates itself; it does not \"fix\" the overall orientation of the molecule in space. The entire molecular frame can be rotated arbitrarily without changing $r_{12}$, $r_{23}$, or $\\theta$. Rotational invariance is a defining property of this coordinate set, meaning rotation is a gauge freedom.\n\n**Verdict on D: Incorrect**\n\n**E. At the linear limit $\\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$, reconstructing Cartesian positions with a canonical gauge fixing that places $\\mathbf{R}_2$ at the origin and $\\mathbf{R}_1$ on the $x$-axis leaves an undetermined azimuthal rotation about the $x$-axis, reflecting an enhanced stabilizer of the configuration; nevertheless the internal coordinates still determine the shape up to global rigid motion.**\n\nLet's analyze the linear configuration, where $\\theta=0$ or $\\theta=\\pi$.\nIn this case, all three atoms lie on a single line. The number of rotational degrees of freedom that change the configuration is only $2$, as rotation about the molecular axis leaves the atomic positions unchanged. This is the \"enhanced stabilizer\" mentioned: for a linear object, the symmetry group of rotations that leaves it invariant is $SO(2)$, whereas for a non-linear object it's the trivial group. This means the dimension of the shape space is $3N-5=4$. However, the question here is about the coordinate set's ability to describe the shape, not its suitability for dynamics.\n\nLet's perform the gauge fixing:\n1. Place $\\mathbf{R}_2$ at the origin: $\\mathbf{R}_2 = (0, 0, 0)$. This fixes the 3 translational degrees of freedom.\n2. Place $\\mathbf{R}_1$ on the positive $x$-axis: $\\mathbf{R}_1 = (r_{12}, 0, 0)$. This fixes 2 rotational degrees of freedom.\nThe third rotational degree of freedom is the azimuthal rotation around the $1-2$ bond axis (the $x$-axis).\nFor a non-linear molecule ($\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$), atom $3$ lies off this axis. We can fix this last rotational freedom by, for example, requiring atom $3$ to lie in the upper half of the $xy$-plane ($z_3=0, y_30$).\nFor a linear molecule ($\\theta=0$ or $\\theta=\\pi$), atom $3$ also lies on the $x$-axis. Its position is $\\mathbf{R}_3 = (r_{23} \\cos\\theta, 0, 0)$. Rotation around the $x$-axis does not move atom $3$. Thus, this rotational degree of freedom is \"undetermined\" or, more accurately, degenerate; the gauge-fixing procedure is singular. The statement correctly identifies this phenomenon.\n\nThe second part claims that \"the internal coordinates still determine the shape up to global rigid motion\". Given $(r_{12}, r_{23}, \\theta=\\pi)$, we know atom $3$ is collinear with $1$ and $2$, with $2$ in the middle. The shape is a line segment of total length $r_{12}+r_{23}$. This is a uniquely defined geometric shape. Any Cartesian realization of this linear molecule can be translated and rotated to coincide with any other realization. The singularity of the coordinate system at this point (a weakness for dynamics) does not prevent it from specifying the static geometry. The statement is correct in both its parts.\n\n**Verdict on E: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3406081"}, {"introduction": "Building on the static, geometric description, this practice delves into the dynamics of molecular motion.

It demonstrates that the squared angular frequencies, $\\omega^2$, are the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{G}^{-1}\\mathbf{F}$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Larger Eigenvalue**\n\nWe need to compute the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}^{-1}\\mathbf{F}$. First, we find $\\mathbf{G}^{-1}$.\n$$\\mathbf{G}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\mathbf{G})} \\begin{pmatrix} G_{22}  -G_{12} \\\\ -G_{21}  G_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{(2m+M)^2}{m^2M(2m+M)} \\frac{m}{2m+M} \\begin{pmatrix} m+M  -m \\\\ -m  m+M \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\mathbf{G}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{mM} \\begin{pmatrix} m+M  -m \\\\ -m  m+M \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{M}  -\\frac{1}{M} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{M}  \\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{M} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is the standard Wilson $\\mathbf{G}$-matrix, $\\mathbf{G}_{\\text{Wilson}}$.\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{F}$ is given as $\\mathbf{F} = k\\mathbf{I}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} k  0 \\\\ 0  k \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe product $\\mathbf{G}^{-1}\\mathbf{F}$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{G}^{-1}\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{G}_{\\text{Wilson}}(k\\mathbf{I}_2) = k\\mathbf{G}_{\\text{Wilson}} = k \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{M}  -\\frac{1}{M} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{M}  \\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{M} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are the values of $\\omega^2$. Let $\\lambda = \\omega^2$. The eigenvalues of $k\\mathbf{A}$ are $k$ times the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$. So we find the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}_{\\text{Wilson}}$ and multiply by $k$.\nLet $\\lambda'$ be an eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{G}_{\\text{Wilson}}$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(\\mathbf{G}_{\\text{Wilson}} - \\lambda'\\mathbf{I}) = 0$.\nLet $a = \\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{M}$ and $b = -\\frac{1}{M}$.\n$$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} a-\\lambda'  b \\\\ b  a-\\lambda' \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\n$$(a-\\lambda')^2 - b^2 = 0 \\implies a-\\lambda' = \\pm b \\implies \\lambda' = a \\mp b$$\nThe two eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}_{\\text{Wilson}}$ are:\n$$\\lambda'_1 = a - b = \\left(\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{M}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{M}\\right) = \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{2}{M}$$\n$$\\lambda'_2 = a + b = \\left(\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{M}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{M}\\right) = \\frac{1}{m}$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}^{-1}\\mathbf{F}$ are $\\omega^2 = k\\lambda'$.\n$$\\omega_1^2 = k\\lambda'_1 = k\\left(\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{2}{M}\\right)$$\n$$\\omega_2^2 = k\\lambda'_2 = \\frac{k}{m}$$\nWe need to find the larger of these two eigenvalues. Since $m$, $M$, and $k$ are positive physical quantities, $\\frac{2}{M}$ is a positive term. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{2}{M}  \\frac{1}{m}$$\nThis implies that $k\\left(\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{2}{M}\\right)  \\frac{k}{m}$.\nThe larger squared angular frequency is $\\omega_1^2$.\nThis eigenvalue corresponds to the asymmetric stretching mode of the molecule.\nThe final expression for the larger eigenvalue is $k\\left(\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{2}{M}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k\\left(\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{2}{M}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3406082"}, {"introduction": "This final practice explores a more subtle but critical topic: how the topological properties and boundary conditions of your coordinate system impact the system's long-term statistical behavior.

Under periodic boundary conditions with $\\,\\tau\\neq 0\\,$, a unique nonequilibrium steady state exists with a $\\,2\\pi$-periodic stationary density and a constant nonzero current; the density reduces to Boltzmann only when $\\,\\tau=0\\,$.
