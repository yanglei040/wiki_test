Classically, the vibrational frequency depends only on the curvature of the potential at the equilibrium position $x=0$. Anharmonicity (the $\\alpha x^3$ term) does not affect this curvature at the minimum, so the classical frequency is independent of $\\alpha$. In the quantum picture, the zero-point energy (ZPE) contribution, $\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega(x)$, creates a ZPE-induced force when the potential is anharmonic. This force shifts the average internuclear distance to a new, mass-dependent equilibrium position $x_{\\mathrm{qu}}(m)$. The vibrational frequency is then determined by the curvature of the original potential $V(x)$ at this new, shifted position. This leads to a mass-dependent correction to the frequency which is entirely absent in the classical model. Therefore, a classical potential energy function is insufficient to reproduce the correct isotope-dependent vibrational frequencies in the presence of anharmonicity, as it misses the crucial role of zero-point energy in modifying the effective molecular structure and dynamics.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{9\\alpha^2\\hbar}{2k^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{m_1} - \\frac{1}{m_2}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3421152"}]}
