In a quasi-equilibrium regime at temperature $T$, the coordinate $z$ fluctuates thermally about $z_{0}(t)$ with a root-mean-square fluctuation that depends on the stiffness $k$.

This stiffness must be sufficient to ensure that the systematic error in the local approximation of the potential of mean force, $G(z)$, arising from thermal fluctuations, does not exceed a specified tolerance $\\epsilon$. The derivation will proceed from the two foundational principles provided: the equipartition theorem and Taylor's theorem.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the thermal fluctuations of the reaction coordinate $z$ and the stiffness $k$ of the guiding potential. The system is described as being in a quasi-equilibrium regime at temperature $T$. The biasing potential is given as $U_{\\text{bias}}(z,t)=\\frac{1}{2}k(z-z_{0}(t))^{2}$. Let $\\Delta z = z - z_{0}(t)$ be the displacement of the coordinate from its time-dependent target position. The energy associated with this displacement, within the harmonic approximation provided by the guiding potential, is $U_{\\text{bias}} = \\frac{1}{2}k(\\Delta z)^{2}$.\n\nAccording to the equipartition theorem for a single quadratic degree of freedom in thermal equilibrium, the average potential energy is related to the temperature. Working in molar units as specified, this relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\langle U_{\\text{bias}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}RT\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the molar gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting the expression for the average potential energy:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2}k(\\Delta z)^{2} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k \\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}RT\n$$\nSolving for the mean-squared fluctuation, $\\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle = \\frac{RT}{k}\n$$\nThis equation demonstrates that the magnitude of thermal fluctuations is inversely proportional to the stiffness of the restraining potential.\n\nNext, we quantify the systematic error introduced by these fluctuations when probing the potential of mean force, $G(z)$. The value of $G(z)$ is sampled not at the precise target point $z_{0}$, but over a distribution of positions $z = z_{0} + \\Delta z$ due to thermal motion. The systematic error can be defined as the difference between the average potential of mean force experienced by the system, $\\langle G(z) \\rangle$, and the value of the potential of mean force at the designated reference point, $G(z_{0})$.\n$$\n\\text{Error} = \\langle G(z_{0} + \\Delta z) \\rangle - G(z_{0})\n$$\nTo estimate this error, we use Taylor's theorem to expand $G(z)$ around $z_{0}$. Given that $G(z)$ is twice continuously differentiable, we have:\n$$\nG(z_{0} + \\Delta z) = G(z_{0}) + G'(z_{0})\\Delta z + \\frac{1}{2}G''(z_{0})(\\Delta z)^{2} + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta z)^3)\n$$\nTaking the thermal average of this expansion, we get:\n$$\n\\langle G(z_{0} + \\Delta z) \\rangle = \\langle G(z_{0}) \\rangle + \\langle G'(z_{0})\\Delta z \\rangle + \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2}G''(z_{0})(\\Delta z)^{2} \\right\\rangle + \\langle \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta z)^3) \\rangle\n$$\nIn the quasi-equilibrium regime, fluctuations are symmetric around the mean, so the average displacement $\\langle \\Delta z \\rangle = 0$. Assuming higher-order odd moments are also zero, and for small fluctuations, we can truncate the series. The error is then approximated by:\n$$\n\\text{Error} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}G''(z_{0})\\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem specifies a bound on the magnitude of the curvature of the potential of mean force, $|G''(z)| \\le M$. Therefore, the magnitude of the error is bounded as follows:\n$$\n|\\text{Error}| \\le \\frac{1}{2}|G''(z_{0})|\\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle \\le \\frac{1}{2}M\\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle\n$$\nTo guarantee that the error does not exceed the tolerance $\\epsilon$, we must ensure that this upper bound on the error is less than or equal to $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}M\\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle \\le \\epsilon\n$$\nNow, we combine our two main results by substituting the expression for the mean-squared fluctuation, $\\langle (\\Delta z)^{2} \\rangle = \\frac{RT}{k}$, into the error inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}M\\left(\\frac{RT}{k}\\right) \\le \\epsilon\n$$\nWe are asked to find the smallest stiffness $k$ that satisfies this condition for all possible $z$ (and thus all possible values of $G''(z)$ within the bound $M$).

We can use methods such as bisection or Newton-Raphson. Given the work values, the solution for $\\Delta G$ is expected to lie in the region where the work distributions overlap, roughly between $45$ kJ/mol and $58$ kJ/mol.\n\nLet's define the function to be solved for $\\Delta G$ in kJ/mol:\n$$\nF(\\Delta G) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(0.4009078 \\times (W_i^F - \\Delta G))} - \\sum_{j=1}^{6} \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(0.4009078 \\times (\\Delta G - W_j^R))} = 0\n$$\nwith the given sets of work values $W^F$ and $W^R$.\nSolving this transcendental equation numerically (e.g., using a bisection method or a numerical solver like Newton's method) yields the solution for $\\Delta G$.\nLet's test a value, for instance $\\Delta G = 51.7$ kJ/mol.\nThe sum over forward works becomes approximately $2.874$.\nThe sum over reverse works becomes approximately $2.898$.\n$F(51.7) \\approx 2.874 - 2.898 = -0.024$.\nLet's test $\\Delta G = 51.8$ kJ/mol.\nThe sum over forward works becomes approximately $2.913$.\nThe sum over reverse works becomes approximately $2.863$.\n$F(51.8) \\approx 2.913 - 2.863 = +0.050$.\nSince $F(51.7) < 0$ and $F(51.8) > 0$, the root is between $51.7$ kJ/mol and $51.8$ kJ/mol.\n\nA more precise numerical calculation yields:\n$$\n\\Delta G \\approx 51.7349386 \\, \\text{kJ/mol}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $1$, $7$, and $3$. The fifth significant digit is $4$. Since $4 < 5$, we round down (i.e., we truncate).\n$$\n\\Delta G \\approx 51.73 \\, \\text{kJ/mol}\n$$\nThis is the final estimated equilibrium free-energy difference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{51.73}$$", "id": "3449594"}]}
