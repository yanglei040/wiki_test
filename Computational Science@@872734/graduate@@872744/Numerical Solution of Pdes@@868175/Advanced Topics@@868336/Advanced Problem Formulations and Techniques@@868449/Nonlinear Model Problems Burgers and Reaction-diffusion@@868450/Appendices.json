Report only this final location as your answer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the Riemann problem for the inviscid Burgers equation, followed by a specific calculation. The PDE is a scalar conservation law, $u_{t} + f(u)_{x} = 0$, where the conserved quantity is $u(x,t)$ and the flux is $f(u) = \\frac{1}{2}u^{2}$. The equation is $u_{t} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}u^{2}\\right)_{x} = 0$. Using the chain rule, this can be written in quasilinear form as $u_{t} + u u_{x} = 0$. The initial data is a Riemann problem:\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\nu_{L},  x0,\\\\\nu_{R},  x0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFirst, we justify the emergence of a self-similar solution. The Burgers equation $u_{t} + u u_{x} = 0$ is invariant under the scaling transformation $(x,t) \\to (\\lambda x, \\lambda t)$ for any constant $\\lambda  0$. Let $x'=\\lambda x$, $t'=\\lambda t$, and define $v(x',t') = u(x,t)$. The partial derivatives transform as $u_{t} = \\lambda v_{t'}$ and $u_{x} = \\lambda v_{x'}$. Substituting into the PDE gives $\\lambda v_{t'} + v(\\lambda v_{x'}) = 0$, which simplifies to $v_{t'} + v v_{x'} = 0$. The PDE is unchanged. The initial data $u(x,0)$ depends only on the sign of $x$, which is also invariant under scaling $x \\to \\lambda x$ for $\\lambda  0$. Since both the governing equation and the initial data are invariant under this scaling, the solution itself is expected to be scale-invariant. A function $u(x,t)$ is scale-invariant if $u(\\lambda x, \\lambda t) = u(x,t)$. This property implies that $u$ must be a function of the ratio $\\xi = x/t$. We thus seek a self-similar solution of the form $u(x,t) = U(\\xi)$.\n\nTo derive the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $U(\\xi)$, we substitute this form into the quasilinear PDE $u_{t} + u u_{x} = 0$. Using the chain rule:\n$$ u_{t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} U(x/t) = U'(\\xi) \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial t} = U'(\\xi) \\left(-\\frac{x}{t^{2}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\xi}{t}U'(\\xi) $$\n$$ u_{x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} U(x/t) = U'(\\xi) \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial x} = U'(\\xi) \\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) = \\frac{1}{t}U'(\\xi) $$\nSubstituting these into the PDE yields:\n$$ -\\frac{\\xi}{t}U'(\\xi) + U(\\xi) \\left(\\frac{1}{t}U'(\\xi)\\right) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $t$, we get the ODE for the self-similar profile on smooth regions:\n$$ (U(\\xi) - \\xi) U'(\\xi) = 0 $$\nThis ODE implies that for any $\\xi$, either $U'(\\xi)=0$ (so $U(\\xi)$ is a constant) or $U(\\xi) = \\xi$.\n\nNext, we derive the propagation speed of a discontinuity. We start from the integral form of the conservation law over an arbitrary fixed interval $[x_1, x_2]$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u(x,t) dx = f(u(x_1,t)) - f(u(x_2,t)) $$\nLet a discontinuity be located at $x=s(t)$ with speed $S = s'(t)$. Let $u_L = \\lim_{x \\to s(t)^-} u(x,t)$ and $u_R = \\lim_{x \\to s(t)^+} u(x,t)$. We apply the integral law to an interval $[x_1, x_2]$ that contains $s(t)$, i.e., $x_1  s(t)  x_2$. The left-hand side can be written using the Leibniz integral rule on the moving subdomains $[x_1, s(t)]$ and $[s(t), x_2]$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u dx = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\int_{x_1}^{s(t)} u dx + \\int_{s(t)}^{x_2} u dx\\right) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u_t dx + S(u_L - u_R) $$\nWithin the smooth regions, $u_t = -f(u)_x$. Thus,\n$$ \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u_t dx = -\\int_{x_1}^{s(t)} f(u)_x dx - \\int_{s(t)}^{x_2} f(u)_x dx = -(f(u_L) - f(u(x_1,t))) - (f(u(x_2,t)) - f(u_R)) $$\nCombining these results gives:\n$$ f(u(x_1,t)) - f(u(x_2,t)) = -(f(u_L) - f(u(x_1,t))) - (f(u(x_2,t)) - f(u_R)) + S(u_L - u_R) $$\n$$ f(u_L) - f(u_R) = S(u_L - u_R) $$\nThis relation is the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition. For $u_L \\neq u_R$, the speed of the discontinuity is:\n$$ S = \\frac{f(u_L) - f(u_R)}{u_L - u_R} $$\nFor the inviscid Burgers equation with $f(u) = \\frac{1}{2}u^2$, this becomes:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}u_L^2 - \\frac{1}{2}u_R^2}{u_L - u_R} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_L + u_R) $$\n\nTo formulate the selection criterion, we consider the characteristic speeds. For the equation $u_t + uu_x = 0$, the characteristic curves are given by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = u$, meaning information propagates at speed $u$.\nIf $u_L  u_R$, characteristics originating from $x0$ have speed $u_L$ and those from $x0$ have speed $u_R$. Since $u_Lu_R$, the characteristics are moving apart, creating a widening gap. The solution must smoothly connect $u_L$ and $u_R$ across this gap. This solution is a rarefaction wave (or expansion fan). In the fan region, the solution is not constant, so from the ODE $(U(\\xi) - \\xi) U'(\\xi) = 0$, we must have $U(\\xi) = \\xi$, which is $u(x,t) = x/t$. This fan spans the region between the characteristic speeds $u_L$ and $u_R$. The explicit self-similar solution is:\n$$ u(x,t) = \\begin{cases} u_{L},  \\text{if } x/t \\le u_{L} \\\\ x/t,  \\text{if } u_{L}  x/t  u_{R} \\\\ u_{R},  \\text{if } x/t \\ge u_{R} \\end{cases} $$\nIf $u_L  u_R$, characteristics from the left are faster than those from the right. They will collide and overlap, which would lead to a multi-valued, unphysical solution. To prevent this, a discontinuity (a shock wave) forms. This shock must satisfy the entropy condition, which for a convex flux like $f(u)=\\frac{1}{2}u^2$ requires that characteristics enter the shock from both sides. This means the characteristic speed to the left, $c(u_L)=u_L$, must be greater than the shock speed $S$, and the shock speed must be greater than the characteristic speed to the right, $c(u_R)=u_R$. That is, $u_L  S  u_R$. Let's verify this using $S=\\frac{1}{2}(u_L+u_R)$.\n$u_L  \\frac{1}{2}(u_L+u_R) \\iff \\frac{1}{2}u_L  \\frac{1}{2}u_R \\iff u_L  u_R$, which is true.\n$\\frac{1}{2}(u_L+u_R)  u_R \\iff \\frac{1}{2}u_L  \\frac{1}{2}u_R \\iff u_L  u_R$, which is also true.\nThus, when $u_L  u_R$, the physically admissible solution is a single shock wave propagating with speed $S$, and the solution is:\n$$ u(x,t) = \\begin{cases} u_{L},  \\text{if } x  St \\\\ u_{R},  \\text{if } x  St \\end{cases} $$\n\nFor the specific case, we are given $u_{L}=\\frac{5}{3}$ and $u_{R}=-\\frac{1}{3}$.\nSince $u_{L} = \\frac{5}{3}  -\\frac{1}{3} = u_{R}$, the solution is a shock wave.\nThe speed of the shock, $S$, is given by the Rankine-Hugoniot condition:\n$$ S = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{L} + u_{R}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{3} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThe shock originates at $(x,t)=(0,0)$ and its position at any time $t0$ is given by the line $x(t) = St$.\nWe need to find the location of this discontinuity at time $t = \\frac{9}{8}$.\n$$ x = S \\cdot t = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{9}{8}\\right) $$\n$$ x = \\frac{18}{24} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThe exact $x$-location of the discontinuity at $t=\\frac{9}{8}$ is $\\frac{3}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$$", "id": "3424885"}, {"introduction": "Building directly on the analytical solution of the Riemann problem, the Godunov method provides a powerful framework for constructing numerical schemes that respect the underlying physics of hyperbolic systems.
