It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a classic one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion problem with a piecewise constant coefficient, which is a fundamental model in transport phenomena. All necessary conditions and parameters are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe governing equation is the steady-state diffusion equation in one dimension,\n$$-\\big(k(x)\\,u'(x)\\big)' = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,1).$$\nThis equation is the differential form of a conservation law. Let the physical flux be defined as $q(x) = -k(x)\\,u'(x)$. The governing equation can then be written as $q'(x) = 0$. Integrating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that the flux $q(x)$ must be a constant throughout the domain $[0,1]$. Let us denote this constant flux by $q$. This is the mathematical expression of \"control-volume balance\" for any arbitrary control volume within the domain: the flux entering the volume equals the flux exiting it, as there are no sources or sinks. The continuity of flux across the interface at $x=\\alpha$ is thus automatically enforced by this conclusion.\n\nThe diffusivity $k(x)$ is piecewise constant:\n$$k(x) = \\begin{cases}\nk_{1}, & x \\in [0,\\alpha],\\\\\nk_{2}, & x \\in [\\alpha,1],\n\\end{cases}$$\nwhere $k_{1}>0$, $k_{2}>0$, and $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. The solution $u(x)$ must satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0) = U_{0}$ and $u(1) = U_{1}$.\n\nWe solve the equation on each subinterval by integrating the relation $q = -k(x)u'(x)$.\n\nFor the first subinterval, $x \\in [0,\\alpha]$, we have $q = -k_{1}u'(x)$. Integrating with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$u'(x) = -\\frac{q}{k_{1}}.$$\nA second integration yields the general solution for $u(x)$ in this region:\n$$u(x) = -\\frac{q}{k_{1}}x + C_{1},$$\nwhere $C_{1}$ is an integration constant.\n\nFor the second subinterval, $x \\in [\\alpha,1]$, we have $q = -k_{2}u'(x)$.

We determine these using the two boundary conditions and the condition of solution continuity at the interface $x=\\alpha$.\n\n1.  Apply the boundary condition at $x=0$: $u(0) = U_{0}$.\n    From the solution on the first subinterval, we have $u(0) = -\\frac{q}{k_{1}}(0) + C_{1} = C_{1}$.\n    Thus, $C_{1} = U_{0}$.
