This means the argument of the sine on the right-hand side, $k \\Delta x / 2$, lies in the interval $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$. In this interval, the sine function is monotonic and its inverse is single-valued. This allows us to equate the arguments directly:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2} = \\pm \\frac{k \\Delta x}{2} \\implies \\omega = \\pm k \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} $$\nSince for $\\lambda=1$ we have $c = \\Delta x / \\Delta t$, the dispersion relation simplifies to:\n$$ \\omega(k) = \\pm c k $$\nThis is identical to the dispersion relation of the continuous wave equation.\n\n**Nondispersive Transport**:\nA scheme is nondispersive if all Fourier components travel at the same speed. This requires the numerical phase velocity $v_p(k) = \\omega(k)/k$ and the numerical group velocity $v_g(k) = d\\omega/dk$ to be constant and equal to the true wave speed.\n\nThe problem asks for conditions where $v_p = c$ and $v_g = c$. Let's examine the branch $\\omega(k) = ck$:\n- Numerical phase velocity: $v_p(k) = \\frac{\\omega(k)}{k} = \\frac{ck}{k} = c$ for $k \\ne 0$.\n- Numerical group velocity: $v_g(k) = \\frac{d\\omega}{dk} = \\frac{d(ck)}{dk} = c$.\nBoth velocities are exactly $c$ for all $k$ in the Brillouin zone. This branch corresponds to right-propagating waves.\n\nFor the other branch, $\\omega(k) = -ck$:\n- Numerical phase velocity: $v_p(k) = \\frac{-ck}{k} = -c$ for $k \\ne 0$.\n- Numerical group velocity: $v_g(k) = \\frac{d(-ck)}{dk} = -c$.\nBoth velocities are exactly $-c$. This branch corresponds to left-propagating waves.\n\nThe problem specifically asks for the class of initial data for which the numerical velocities equal $c$. This condition selects the purely right-propagating solutions. A general solution is a superposition of right- and left-propagating components. A solution is purely right-propagating if its initial conditions, $u(x,0) = \\phi(x)$ and $u_t(x,0) = \\psi(x)$, satisfy the relation $\\psi(x) = -c \\phi'(x)$.\n\nFor the discrete system, this translates to a condition on the initial grid functions $u_j^0 = \\phi_j$ and the initial velocity, which is usually approximated by a difference formula involving a fictitious time step $n=-1$. Using the central difference for the time derivative at $n=0$, $\\frac{u_j^1 - u_j^{-1}}{2\\Delta t} = \\psi_j$, it can be shown that an exact rightward translation $u_j^n = \\phi_{j-n}$ is a solution to the scheme with $\\lambda=1$ if the initial velocity is set to $\\psi_j = -c \\frac{\\phi_{j+1} - \\phi_{j-1}}{2\\Delta x}$.\n\nThus, the class of initial data for which the scheme transports signals with velocity $c$ are those data corresponding to purely right-propagating waves. In terms of the discrete Fourier spectrum of the initial conditions $(\\hat{\\phi}(k), \\hat{\\psi}(k))$, this corresponds to components where the left-propagating part is zero, which is enforced by the relation $\\hat{\\psi}(k) = -ic k \\hat{\\phi}(k)$ (for the continuous case) or its discrete equivalent.\n\n**Phase Error**:\nThe phase error quantifies the deviation of the numerical phase velocity from the exact phase velocity. For the branch $\\omega(k) = ck$ with $\\lambda=1$, the numerical phase velocity is $c$. The exact phase velocity is also $c$. Therefore, the ratio of numerical to exact phase velocity is $1$, and the phase error is identically zero for all $k$ in the Brillouin zone. The scheme provides exact, nondispersive transport for any wave resolvable on the grid, provided the initial conditions are set to excite only one propagation direction.\n\n### Step 4: Final Expression for $\\omega(k)$\nThe final task is to provide the exact, closed-form analytic expression for $\\omega(k)$ for $\\lambda=1$. As derived above, the two branches of the dispersion relation are $\\omega(k) = ck$ and $\\omega(k) = -ck$. Conventionally, when a single expression is requested for a dispersive system, the branch passing through the origin, representing a particular family of propagation modes, is chosen. For the right-propagating mode, this is $\\omega(k) = ck$. This is a single, analytic function of $k$ over the specified domain.\n\n$$ \\omega(k) = ck $$\nThis holds for all $k \\in [-\\pi/\\Delta x, \\pi/\\Delta x]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{c k}$$", "id": "3388743"}, {"introduction": "While the standard second-order scheme is robust, many applications demand greater accuracy.

This requires the right-hand side to be real and in the interval $[0, 1]$ for all $\\xi \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$. Since centered difference schemes for $u_{xx}$ have $\\hat{S}(\\xi) \\le 0$, the condition becomes $0 \\le -\\frac{\\nu^2}{4}\\hat{S}(\\xi) \\le 1$.\nThis simplifies to the stability condition $\\nu^2 \\le \\frac{-4}{\\hat{S}(\\xi)}$ for all $\\xi$. The most restrictive condition is obtained when the right side is minimal, which occurs at the minimum value of $\\hat{S}(\\xi)$ (its most negative value):\n$\\nu^2 \\le \\frac{-4}{\\min_{\\xi} \\hat{S}(\\xi)}$.\n\nStandard 3-point, 2nd-order stencil: $\\delta_{xx}^{(2)} u_j = \\frac{u_{j-1}-2u_j+u_{j+1}}{\\Delta x^2}$.\nThe dimensionless symbol is $\\hat{S}^{(2)}(\\xi) = \\exp(-i\\xi) - 2 + \\exp(i\\xi) = 2\\cos(\\xi) - 2 = -4\\sin^2(\\frac{\\xi}{2})$.\nThe minimum value is $\\min_{\\xi} \\hat{S}^{(2)}(\\xi) = -4$ (at $\\xi=\\pi$).\nThe stability condition is $\\nu^2 \\le \\frac{-4}{-4} = 1$, so $\\nu \\le 1$.\nThe dispersion relation is $\\sin(\\frac{\\omega\\Delta t}{2}) = \\pm\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\sqrt{4\\sin^2(\\frac{\\xi}{2})} = \\pm\\nu|\\sin(\\frac{\\xi}{2})|$.\n\n5-point, 4th-order stencil: $\\delta_{xx}^{(4)} u_j = \\frac{a u_{j-2} + b u_{j-1} + c u_j + b u_{j+1} + a u_{j+2}}{\\Delta x^2}$.\nThe dimensionless symbol is $\\hat{S}^{(4)}(\\xi) = c + 2b\\cos(\\xi) + 2a\\cos(2\\xi)$.\nSubstituting the coefficients $a = -1/12$, $b = 4/3$, $c = -5/2$:\n$\\hat{S}^{(4)}(\\xi) = -\\frac{5}{2} + 2\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\cos(\\xi) + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{12}\\right)\\cos(2\\xi) = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{8}{3}\\cos(\\xi) - \\frac{1}{6}\\cos(2\\xi)$.\nTo find the minimum, we express this in terms of $\\cos(\\xi)$ using $\\cos(2\\xi) = 2\\cos^2(\\xi) - 1$:\n$\\hat{S}^{(4)}(\\xi) = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{8}{3}\\cos(\\xi) - \\frac{1}{6}(2\\cos^2(\\xi) - 1) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\cos^2(\\xi) + \\frac{8}{3}\\cos(\\xi) - \\frac{7}{3}$.\nLet $y = \\cos(\\xi)$, where $y \\in [-1, 1]$. We seek the minimum of the quadratic function $f(y) = -\\frac{1}{3}y^2 + \\frac{8}{3}y - \\frac{7}{3}$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$. The parabola opens downward, with its vertex at $y = -\\frac{8/3}{2(-1/3)} = 4$. Since the vertex is outside the interval $[-1, 1]$, the minimum must occur at one of the endpoints.\n$f(1) = -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{7}{3} = 0$.\n$f(-1) = -\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{7}{3} = -\\frac{16}{3}$.\nThe most negative value of the symbol is $\\min_{\\xi} \\hat{S}^{(4)}(\\xi) = -16/3$.\nThe dispersion relation is $\\sin(\\frac{\\omega\\Delta t}{2}) = \\pm \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\sqrt{-[-\\frac{1}{3}\\cos^2(\\xi) + \\frac{8}{3}\\cos(\\xi) - \\frac{7}{3}]} = \\pm \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}\\cos^2(\\xi) - \\frac{8}{3}\\cos(\\xi) + \\frac{7}{3}}$.\n\nPart 3: Maximum stable Courant number\nUsing the stability condition derived in Part 2 and the minimum value of the Fourier symbol for the fourth-order scheme, we can compute the maximum stable Courant number, $\\nu_{\\max}$.\n$\\nu_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{-4}{\\min_{\\xi} \\hat{S}^{(4)}(\\xi)} = \\frac{-4}{-16/3} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{16} = \\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nTaking the positive square root gives the largest stable Courant number:\n$\\nu_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nThis is the maximum value for the Courant number $\\nu = c\\Delta t/\\Delta x$ for which the explicit fourth-order-in-space, second-order-in-time scheme for the wave equation is stable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$$", "id": "3388759"}]}
