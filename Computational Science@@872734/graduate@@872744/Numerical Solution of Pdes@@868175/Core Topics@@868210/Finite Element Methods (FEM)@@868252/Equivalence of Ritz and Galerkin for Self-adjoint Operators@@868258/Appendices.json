This involves defining the piecewise linear basis functions, calculating the stiffness matrix and load vector, solving the resulting linear system, and showing that minimizing the energy functional leads to the same system.\n\n**1. Basis Functions and their Derivatives**\nThe mesh nodes are at $x_0=0, x_1=1/3, x_2=2/3, x_3=1$. The basis functions $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ associated with the interior nodes $x_1$ and $x_2$ are:\n$\\phi_1(x) = \\begin{cases} 3x & x \\in [0, 1/3] \\\\ 2 - 3x & x \\in [1/3, 2/3] \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$ and $\\phi_2(x) = \\begin{cases} 3x - 1 & x \\in [1/3, 2/3] \\\\ 3 - 3x & x \\in [2/3, 1] \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$\nTheir derivatives are piecewise constant:\n$\\phi_1'(x) = \\begin{cases} 3 & x \\in (0, 1/3) \\\\ -3 & x \\in (1/3, 2/3) \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$ and $\\phi_2'(x) = \\begin{cases} 3 & x \\in (1/3, 2/3) \\\\ -3 & x \\in (2/3, 1) \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$\n\n**2. Stiffness Matrix $K$**\nThe entries are $K_{ij} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi_i'(x) \\phi_j'(x) \\,dx$.\n$K_{11} = \\int_{0}^{1/3} (3)^2 \\,dx + \\int_{1/3}^{2/3} (-3)^2 \\,dx = 9(\\frac{1}{3}) + 9(\\frac{1}{3}) = 6$.\n$K_{22} = \\int_{1/3}^{2/3} (3)^2 \\,dx + \\int_{2/3}^{1} (-3)^2 \\,dx = 9(\\frac{1}{3}) + 9(\\frac{1}{3}) = 6$.\n$K_{12} = K_{21} = \\int_{1/3}^{2/3} (-3)(3) \\,dx = -9(\\frac{1}{3}) = -3$.\nThus, $K = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & -3 \\\\ -3 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix is symmetric. Its leading principal minors are $6 > 0$ and $\\det(K) = 36-9=27 > 0$, so it is positive definite.\n\n**3. Load Vector $f$**\nThe components are $f_i = \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi_i(x) \\,dx$. This is the area of each triangular hat function, which has a base of length $2/3$ and height 1.\n$f_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n$f_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThus, the load vector is $f = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 1/3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**4.

Substituting into the first equation: $6x_1 - 3x_1 = 3x_1 = 1/3$, which gives $x_1 = 1/9$. Thus, $x_1 = x_2 = 1/9$.\nThe coefficient vector is $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/9 \\\\ 1/9 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**5. Ritz Method: Minimize $J(u_h)$**\nThe energy functional for $u_h = x_1\\phi_1 + x_2\\phi_2$ is $J(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{x}^T K \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{f}$.\n$J(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(6x_1^2 - 6x_1x_2 + 6x_2^2) - \\frac{1}{3}x_1 - \\frac{1}{3}x_2$.\nTo find the minimum, we set the partial derivatives to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x_1} = 6x_1 - 3x_2 - \\frac{1}{3} = 0 \\implies 6x_1 - 3x_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x_2} = -3x_1 + 6x_2 - \\frac{1}{3} = 0 \\implies -3x_1 + 6x_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThis is the same system of equations, $Kx=f$, obtained from the Galerkin method, and therefore has the same solution $x_1 = 1/9, x_2 = 1/9$.\n\n**Equivalence of Methods**\nThe equivalence of the two methods is a direct consequence of the properties of the governing operator. The operator $L=-d^2/dx^2$ with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions is self-adjoint, which implies the associated bilinear form $a(u,v) = \\int_0^1 u'v' \\,dx$ is symmetric. The Galerkin method's orthogonality condition $a(u_h, v_h) = \\ell(v_h)$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$ leads to the system $Kx=f$. The Ritz method's minimization condition $\\nabla J(x) = 0$ for the quadratic functional $J(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^T K x - x^T f$ leads to the system $Kx - f = 0$.

For $v_h = c \\varphi$, this becomes a function of $c$: $J(c) = \\frac{c^2}{2} a(\\varphi, \\varphi) - c\\,\\ell(\\varphi) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} c^2 - \\frac{4}{\\pi} c$. The minimum is found by setting the derivative to zero:\n$\\frac{dJ}{dc} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} c - \\frac{4}{\\pi} = 0 \\implies c = \\frac{8}{\\pi^3}$.\nBoth methods yield the same coefficient and thus the same solution: $u_h(x) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^3} \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n\n**2. Exact Solution**\nWe find the exact solution $u(x)$ by integrating $-u''(x) = 2$ twice and applying the boundary conditions $u(0)=u(1)=0$.\n$-u'(x) = 2x + C_1$.\n$u(x) = -x^2 - C_1 x + C_2$.\n$u(0) = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n$u(1) = 0 \\implies -1 - C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -1$.\nThe exact solution is $u(x) = x - x^2 = x(1-x)$.\n\n**3. Energy Norm Error**\nDue to Galerkin orthogonality ($a(u - u_h, v_h) = 0$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$), we have the Pythagorean-like relation $\\|u\\|_E^2 = \\|u_h\\|_E^2 + \\|u - u_h\\|_E^2$. Thus, the squared error norm is $\\|u - u_h\\|_E^2 = \\|u\\|_E^2 - \\|u_h\\|_E^2$.\nWe compute the energy of the exact solution $u(x) = x - x^2$, for which $u'(x) = 1 - 2x$:\n$\\|u\\|_E^2 = a(u,u) = \\int_{0}^{1} (1-2x)^2 dx = \\left[ x - 2x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x^3 \\right]_0^1 = 1 - 2 + \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe compute the energy of the approximate solution $u_h(x) = \\frac{8}{\\pi^3} \\sin(\\pi x)$:\n$\\|u_h\\|_E^2 = a(u_h, u_h) = \\left(\\frac{8}{\\pi^3}\\right)^2 a(\\sin(\\pi x), \\sin(\\pi x)) = \\frac{64}{\\pi^6} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{32}{\\pi^4}$.\nThe squared error norm is:\n$\\|u - u_h\\|_E^2 = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{32}{\\pi^4}$.\nThe energy norm of the error is therefore $\\|u - u_h\\|_E = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{32}{\\pi^4}}$.\n\n**4. Justification of Equivalence**\nFor a self-adjoint operator, the corresponding bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is symmetric. The Galerkin method finds a $u_h \\in V_h$ satisfying the orthogonality condition $a(u-u_h, v_h) = 0$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$. This means $u_h$ is the orthogonal projection of the exact solution $u$ onto $V_h$ in the energy inner product. Projections are unique points of best approximation, so $\\|u-u_h\\|_E = \\min_{v_h \\in V_h} \\|u-v_h\\|_E$.\nThe Ritz method seeks to minimize the functional $J(v_h) = \\frac{1}{2}a(v_h, v_h) - \\ell(v_h)$. Minimizing this functional is equivalent to minimizing $\\|u - v_h\\|_E^2 = a(u,u) - 2\\ell(v_h) + a(v_h, v_h)$, because $a(u,u)$ is constant and $a(u,v_h)=\\ell(v_h)$. Thus, the Ritz method also finds the best approximation from the subspace. Both methods are different formulations for finding the same unique element $u_h \\in V_h$: the orthogonal projection of $u$ onto $V_h$.
