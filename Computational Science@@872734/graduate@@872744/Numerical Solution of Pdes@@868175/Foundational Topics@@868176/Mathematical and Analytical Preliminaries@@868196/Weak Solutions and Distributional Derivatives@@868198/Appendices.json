It addresses a fundamental concept in the theory of distributions, which is a cornerstone of modern analysis of partial differential equations. The function $u(x)=|x|$ is a canonical example used to illustrate the concept of weak or distributional derivatives for functions that are not classically differentiable everywhere. The definitions and objects, such as test functions $C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$, the Dirac distribution $\\delta_0$, and the Lebesgue-Radon decomposition, are standard in functional analysis. The problem is self-contained, unambiguous, and does not violate any mathematical principles. It is a standard, non-trivial exercise in this field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\nWe begin by applying the definition of the distributional derivative to the function $u(x) = |x|$. For an arbitrary test function $\\varphi \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle D u, \\varphi \\rangle = - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x) \\varphi'(x) dx = - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| \\varphi'(x) dx\n$$\nThe absolute value function $|x|$ is defined piecewise. We split the integral at the point of non-differentiability, $x=0$:\n$$\n\\langle D u, \\varphi \\rangle = - \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} |x| \\varphi'(x) dx + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |x| \\varphi'(x) dx \\right)\n$$\nWe substitute the definition of $|x|$ in each interval: $|x| = -x$ for $x  0$ and $|x| = x$ for $x > 0$. The value at the single point $x=0$ does not affect the value of the Lebesgue integrals.\n$$\n\\langle D u, \\varphi \\rangle = - \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} (-x) \\varphi'(x) dx + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\varphi'(x) dx \\right)\n$$\nWe now apply integration by parts to each integral. For the first integral, $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$, we set $u = -x$ and $dv = \\varphi'(x) dx$. This gives $du = -dx$ and $v = \\varphi(x)$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} (-x) \\varphi'(x) dx = \\left[(-x) \\varphi(x)\\right]_{-\\infty}^{0} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\varphi(x) (-dx)\n$$\nThe boundary term is evaluated as $\\lim_{x \\to 0^{-}} (-x \\varphi(x)) - \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (-x \\varphi(x))$. Since $\\varphi$ is a test function, it has compact support, meaning it is zero outside some finite interval $[-M, M]$. Thus, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (-x \\varphi(x)) = 0$. At the other boundary, $\\lim_{x \\to 0^{-}} (-x \\varphi(x)) = 0 \\cdot \\varphi(0) = 0$. So the boundary term vanishes. This leaves:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} (-x) \\varphi'(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\varphi(x) dx\n$$\nFor the second integral, we set $u = x$ and $dv = \\varphi'(x) dx$. This gives $du = dx$ and $v = \\varphi(x)$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\varphi'(x) dx = \\left[x \\varphi(x)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varphi(x) dx\n$$\nSimilarly, the boundary term $\\left[x \\varphi(x)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (x \\varphi(x)) - \\lim_{x \\to 0^{+}} (x \\varphi(x))$ is zero due to the compact support of $\\varphi$ and the fact that $\\lim_{x \\to 0^{+}} (x \\varphi(x)) = 0$. This leaves:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\varphi'(x) dx = - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varphi(x) dx\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\langle D u, \\varphi \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle D u, \\varphi \\rangle = - \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\varphi(x) dx - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varphi(x) dx \\right) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varphi(x) dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\varphi(x) dx\n$$\nWe can express this result using the sign function, $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$, which is defined as:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\ -1  \\text{if } x  0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x = 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe integral can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\langle D u, \\varphi \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1) \\cdot \\varphi(x) dx + \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} (-1) \\cdot \\varphi(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\operatorname{sgn}(x) \\varphi(x) dx\n$$\nThis final expression shows that the action of the distribution $D u$ on any test function $\\varphi$ is equivalent to integrating $\\varphi$ against the function $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$. The function $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ is locally integrable on $\\mathbb{R}$, and therefore defines a regular distribution. Thus, we can identify the distributional derivative $D u$ with the function $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$.\n$$\nD u = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)\n$$\nThis is the first part of the required answer.\n\nNow we must interpret this result in the context of the decomposition $D u = f(x) dx + \\alpha \\delta_{0}$. This decomposition is a form of the Lebesgue–Radon decomposition of the measure associated with the distribution $D u$. The term $f(x) dx$ represents the absolutely continuous part of the measure with respect to the Lebesgue measure $dx$, while $\\alpha \\delta_{0}$ represents the singular part, concentrated on the set $\\{0\\}$ which has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\nOur result for the distributional derivative is $D u = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$. This corresponds to the measure $d\\mu = \\operatorname{sgn}(x) dx$. By its very form, this measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure $dx$. Its Radon-Nikodym derivative is the function $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$.\nTherefore, the singular part of this measure is zero.\n\nComparing our derived distribution $D u = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ to the given form $D u = f(x) dx + \\alpha \\delta_{0}$, we can make the following identifications:\n1.  The regular part, represented by the locally integrable function $f(x)$, is $f(x) = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$.\n2.  The singular part, $\\alpha \\delta_0$, must be the zero distribution, as there is no singular component in our result for $D u$.\n\nFor the distribution $\\alpha \\delta_0$ to be the zero distribution, its coefficient $\\alpha$ must be zero.\n$$\n\\alpha = 0\n$$\nThus, the explicit expression for the distributional derivative is $D u = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$, and the coefficient of the singular part is $\\alpha=0$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix containing the expression for $D u$ and the value of $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\operatorname{sgn}(x)  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3462233"}, {"introduction": "The true power of distributional derivatives is realized when solving partial differential equations with singular data, such as a point charge or a concentrated force.

Existence and Uniqueness of the Weak Solution**\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of a solution $u \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ are guaranteed by the Lax-Milgram theorem if the bilinear form $a(u,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)v'(x)\\,dx$ is continuous and coercive on $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, and the linear functional $L(v) = \\langle \\delta_{x_{0}}, v \\rangle$ is continuous on $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\n\nThe bilinear form $a(u,v)$ is the standard inner product on $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, whose associated norm is $\\|v\\|_{H^{1}_{0}} = \\left(\\int_{0}^{1} |v'(x)|^{2}\\,dx\\right)^{1/2}$.\n- Continuity: By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $|a(u,v)| = \\left|\\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)v'(x)\\,dx\\right| \\le \\|u'\\|_{L^{2}}\\|v'\\|_{L^{2}} = \\|u\\|_{H^{1}_{0}}\\|v\\|_{H^{1}_{0}}$. Thus, $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is continuous.\n- Coercivity: $a(v,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} |v'(x)|^{2}\\,dx = \\|v\\|_{H^{1}_{0}}^{2}$. Thus, $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is coercive.\n\nNext, we must show that the functional $L(v) = v(x_{0})$ is a continuous linear functional on $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, which is equivalent to showing that $\\delta_{x_{0}} \\in H^{-1}(\\Omega)$.\nLinearity is straightforward: for any constants $c_{1}, c_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and functions $v_{1}, v_{2} \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, $L(c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2})=(c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2})(x_{0}) = c_{1}v_{1}(x_{0}) + c_{2}v_{2}(x_{0}) = c_{1}L(v_{1})+c_{2}L(v_{2})$.\nFor continuity, we must find a constant $C$ such that $|L(v)| \\le C\\|v\\|_{H^{1}_{0}}$ for all $v \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$. For any $v \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, we can write $v(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} v'(t)\\,dt$ since $v(0)=0$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$:\n$$\n|v(x_{0})| \\le \\left(\\int_{0}^{1} |\\mathbf{1}_{[0, x_{0}]}(t)|^{2}\\,dt\\right)^{1/2} \\left(\\int_{0}^{1} |v'(t)|^{2}\\,dt\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\int_{0}^{x_{0}} 1\\,dt\\right)^{1/2} \\|v'\\|_{L^{2}} = \\sqrt{x_{0}} \\|v\\|_{H^{1}_{0}}.\n$$\nSince $|L(v)| = |v(x_{0})| \\le \\sqrt{x_{0}} \\|v\\|_{H^{1}_{0}}$, the functional $L$ is continuous. The Sobolev embedding theorem for $W^{1,p}(\\Omega) \\hookrightarrow C(\\bar{\\Omega})$ when $p>1$ in one dimension confirms that point evaluation is a continuous operation.\nSince $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is continuous and coercive and $L(\\cdot)$ is continuous, the Lax-Milgram theorem guarantees the existence of a unique weak solution $u \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\n\n**2. Explicit Construction of the Weak Solution**\n\nWe solve the equation $-\\frac{d^{2}u}{dx^{2}} = \\delta_{x_{0}}$ in the sense of distributions. Integrating once with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{du}{dx} = H(x-x_{0}) + C_{1},\n$$\nwhere $H$ is the Heaviside step function and $C_{1}$ is a constant of integration. Integrating a second time yields:\n$$\n-u(x) = \\int H(x-x_{0})\\,dx + C_{1}x + C_{2} = (x-x_{0})H(x-x_{0}) + C_{1}x + C_{2}.\n$$\nThis gives the general solution:\n$$\nu(x) = -(x-x_{0})H(x-x_{0}) - C_{1}x - C_{2}.\n$$\nWe can write this in piecewise form:\n$$\nu(x) = \\begin{cases} -C_{1}x - C_{2}  \\text{if } 0  x  x_{0} \\\\ -(x-x_{0}) - C_{1}x - C_{2}  \\text{if } x_{0}  x  1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nNow we apply the boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$.\nFrom $u(0)=0$: $-C_{1}(0) - C_{2} = 0 \\implies C_{2}=0$.\nFrom $u(1)=0$: $-(1-x_{0}) - C_{1}(1) = 0 \\implies C_{1} = -(1-x_{0})$.\nSubstituting the constants back into the piecewise expression for $u(x)$:\nFor $0  x  x_{0}$: $u(x) = -(-(1-x_{0}))x = (1-x_{0})x$.\nFor $x_{0}  x  1$: $u(x) = -(x-x_{0}) - (-(1-x_{0}))x = -x+x_{0}+x-x_{0}x = x_{0}(1-x)$.\nSo, the solution is\n$$\nu(x) = \\begin{cases} (1-x_{0})x  \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le x_{0} \\\\ x_{0}(1-x)  \\text{if } x_{0} \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function is continuous at $x_0$ and satisfies the boundary conditions. It is in $C^{0}(\\bar{\\Omega})$ and is piecewise linear, hence its first derivative $u'$ is in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$, so $u \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$. For the specific value $x_{0}=\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\nu(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{2}x  \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(1-x)  \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2} \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe singularity is manifest in the derivatives. The classical first derivative is:\n$$\nu'(x) = \\begin{cases} 1-x_{0}  \\text{if } 0  x  x_{0} \\\\ -x_{0}  \\text{if } x_{0}  x  1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function has a jump discontinuity at $x=x_{0}$. The magnitude of the jump is $J = u'(x_{0}^{+}) - u'(x_{0}^{-}) = (-x_{0}) - (1-x_{0}) = -1$.\nThe second distributional derivative is therefore $u'' = J \\cdot \\delta_{x_{0}} = -\\delta_{x_{0}}$. This means $-u'' = \\delta_{x_{0}}$, which is the original differential equation, confirming our constructed solution is correct.\n\n**3. Regularity of the Solution**\n\nTo determine if $u \\in H^{2}(\\Omega)$, we must check if its second weak derivative, $u''$, is in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$. The space $H^{2}(\\Omega)$ is defined as $\\{v \\in L^{2}(\\Omega) \\mid v', v'' \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)\\}$.\nFrom the construction, we found that the second distributional derivative of $u$ is $u'' = -\\delta_{x_{0}}$. We must determine if the distribution $-\\delta_{x_{0}}$ corresponds to a function in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$. A distribution $T$ is in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ if there exists a function $g \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$ such that $\\langle T, \\phi \\rangle = \\int_{\\Omega} g(x)\\phi(x)\\,dx$ for all test functions $\\phi \\in C^{\\infty}_{c}(\\Omega)$.\nFor $T = -\\delta_{x_{0}}$, we have $\\langle -\\delta_{x_{0}}, \\phi \\rangle = -\\phi(x_{0})$. Suppose there exists a function $g \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$ such that $-\\phi(x_{0}) = \\int_{0}^{1} g(x)\\phi(x)\\,dx$ for all $\\phi \\in C^{\\infty}_{c}(\\Omega)$.\nConsider a sequence of non-negative smooth bump functions $\\phi_{n} \\in C^{\\infty}_{c}(\\Omega)$ centered at $x_{0}$, with support shrinking to $\\{x_{0}\\}$ as $n \\to \\infty$, and normalized such that $\\phi_{n}(x_{0})=1$ for all $n$. For instance, let $\\psi$ be a standard bump function with $\\psi(0)=1$ and support in $(-1,1)$, then $\\phi_{n}(x) = \\psi(n(x-x_{0}))$ for $n$ large enough that the support is in $\\Omega$.\nFor each $n$, our hypothesis requires $\\int_{0}^{1} g(x)\\phi_{n}(x)\\,dx = -\\phi_{n}(x_{0}) = -1$.\nHowever, as $n\\to\\infty$, $\\phi_{n}(x) \\to 0$ for all $x \\ne x_{0}$. Since the sequence $\\{\\phi_{n}\\}$ is uniformly bounded (by $\\sup|\\psi|$), and $g \\in L^{2}(\\Omega) \\subset L^{1}(\\Omega)$ on a bounded domain, we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_{0}^{1} g(x)\\phi_{n}(x)\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{1} g(x) \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\phi_{n}(x)\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{1} g(x) \\cdot 0 \\,dx = 0.\n$$\nThis leads to the contradiction $-1=0$. Therefore, no such function $g \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$ exists. The Dirac distribution $\\delta_{x_{0}}$ is not in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$. Consequently, $u'' \\notin L^{2}(\\Omega)$, which proves that the solution $u$ is not in $H^{2}(\\Omega)$.\n\n**4.

A simple way to construct such a functional is to identify it with an element of $L^{2}(\\Omega)$. For any function $g \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$, we can define a functional $f \\in H^{-1}(\\Omega)$ by the formula:\n$$\n\\langle f, v \\rangle := \\int_{\\Omega} g(x) v(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in H^{1}(\\Omega).\n$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, this functional is continuous on $H^{1}(\\Omega)$:\n$$\n|\\langle f, v \\rangle| = \\left| \\int_{\\Omega} g v \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\right| \\le \\|g\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\|v\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\le \\|g\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\|v\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}.\n$$\nThe compatibility condition for such an $f$ would be $\\int_{\\Omega} g(x) \\cdot 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0$. To violate this condition, we need to choose a function $g \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$ whose integral over $\\Omega$ is non-zero.\n\nThe simplest non-trivial choice for $g$ is a non-zero constant. Let us choose $g(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$. This function is in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ because $\\Omega$ is a bounded domain, and $\\int_{\\Omega} 1^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\text{Area}(\\Omega) = 1  \\infty$.\nWe therefore define our explicit $f \\in H^{-1}(\\Omega)$ as the functional given by:\n$$\n\\langle f, v \\rangle = \\int_{\\Omega} v(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar $\\delta := \\langle f, 1 \\rangle$ for this constructed $f$. According to our definition of $f$, we evaluate its action on the test function $v(x) = 1$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\langle f, 1 \\rangle = \\int_{\\Omega} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\nThis integral represents the area of the domain $\\Omega = (0,1)^2$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\text{Area}(\\Omega) = (1-0) \\times (1-0) = 1.\n$$\nSince $\\delta = 1 \\neq 0$, the constructed functional $f$ indeed violates the compatibility condition required for the solvability of the pure Neumann problem. The value of the scalar is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3462267"}]}
