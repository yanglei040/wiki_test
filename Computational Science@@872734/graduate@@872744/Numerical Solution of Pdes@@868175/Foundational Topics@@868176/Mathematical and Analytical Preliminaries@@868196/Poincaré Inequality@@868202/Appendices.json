For any function $u$ defined on $\\Omega$, its restriction to $\\Omega_i$ is $u_i = u|_{\\Omega_i}$. The $L^2$ norms of the function and its gradient decompose over the disjoint union:\n$$ \\lVert u \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\lVert u_1 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2 + \\lVert u_2 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_2)}^2 $$\n$$ \\lVert \\nabla u \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\lVert \\nabla u_1 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2 + \\lVert \\nabla u_2 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_2)}^2 $$\n\n**Analysis of the Dirichlet Case (Options A and D)**\n\nThe space $H_0^1(\\Omega)$ consists of functions in $H^1(\\Omega)$ with zero trace on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega = \\partial\\Omega_1 \\cup \\partial\\Omega_2$. For a function $u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega)$, its restriction $u_i$ to a component $\\Omega_i$ must have zero trace on $\\partial\\Omega_i$. Thus, $u_1 \\in H_0^1(\\Omega_1)$ and $u_2 \\in H_0^1(\\Omega_2)$. The space $H_0^1(\\Omega)$ is isometrically isomorphic to the direct sum $H_0^1(\\Omega_1) \\oplus H_0^1(\\Omega_2)$.\n\nThe Dirichlet-Poincaré inequality holds on each component:\n$$ \\lVert u_i \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_i)} \\le C_P^D(\\Omega_i)\\, \\lVert \\nabla u_i \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_i)} \\quad \\text{for } i=1,2 $$\nLet $C_{\\max}^D = \\max\\{C_P^D(\\Omega_1), C_P^D(\\Omega_2)\\}$. We can write:\n$$ \\lVert u \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\lVert u_1 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2 + \\lVert u_2 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_2)}^2 \\le (C_P^D(\\Omega_1))^2 \\lVert \\nabla u_1 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2 + (C_P^D(\\Omega_2))^2 \\lVert \\nabla u_2 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_2)}^2 $$\n$$ \\le (C_{\\max}^D)^2 \\left( \\lVert \\nabla u_1 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2 + \\lVert \\nabla u_2 \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_2)}^2 \\right) = (C_{\\max}^D)^2 \\lVert \\nabla u \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 $$\nThis shows that $C_P^D(\\Omega) \\le C_{\\max}^D$. To show equality, assume $C_{\\max}^D = C_P^D(\\Omega_1)$. Let $u_1^*$ be a function that saturates the inequality on $\\Omega_1$ (an eigenfunction corresponding to the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\\Omega_1$). Define $u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega)$ by setting $u=u_1^*$ on $\\Omega_1$ and $u=0$ on $\\Omega_2$. For this $u$, the Rayleigh quotient is:\n$$ \\frac{\\lVert u \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2}{\\lVert \\nabla u \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2} = \\frac{\\lVert u_1^* \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2}{\\lVert \\nabla u_1^* \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2} = (C_P^D(\\Omega_1))^2 = (C_{\\max}^D)^2 $$\nThus, the optimal constant is $C_P^D(\\Omega) = \\max\\{C_P^D(\\Omega_1), C_P^D(\\Omega_2)\\}$. This value depends only on the geometry of the individual balls, not on the distance $L$ between them.\n\nThe Poincaré constant for a ball of radius $R$, $C_P^D(B_R)$, is $1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_1}$, where $\\lambda_1$ is the principal eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $B_R$. Through scaling arguments, it can be shown that $\\lambda_1 \\propto 1/R^2$, and therefore $C_P^D(B_R) \\propto R$. Since $R_1 \\ge R_2$, it follows that $C_P^D(B_{R_1}) \\ge C_P^D(B_{R_2})$, so $C_P^D(\\Omega) = C_P^D(B_{R_1})$.\n\n-   **Option A:** This statement asserts that $C_P^D(\\Omega)$ is independent of $L$, equals $\\max\\{C_P^D(B_{R_1}),\\, C_P^D(B_{R_2})\\}$, and scales like $R_1$. This is fully consistent with our derivation.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n-   **Option D:** This statement claims $C_P^D(\\Omega) \\to \\infty$ as $L \\to \\infty$. This directly contradicts our finding that the constant is independent of $L$. The physical separation of components has no effect on the Dirichlet-Poincaré constant due to the strict zero boundary condition on each component, which isolates them completely.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of the Neumann Case (Options B, C, and E)**\n\nThe space is $H^1(\\Omega)$. The seminorm $\\lVert \\nabla u \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}$ is zero for any function that is constant on each connected component. Since $\\Omega$ has two components, the null space of the gradient operator is two-dimensional, spanned by the characteristic functions $\\chi_{\\Omega_1}$ and $\\chi_{\\Omega_2}$. For a Poincaré (or Poincaré-Wirtinger) inequality to hold with a finite constant, the space of functions must be restricted such that no function with zero gradient seminorm remains (except the zero function). This is achieved by imposing constraints, typically zero-mean conditions.\n\n-   **Option B (Global mean-zero):** The constraint is $\\int_\\Omega u \\,dx = 0$. We must check if this removes the entire 2D null space. Consider a function $u$ which is $c_1$ on $\\Omega_1$ and $c_2$ on $\\Omega_2$. Its gradient is zero. The constraint becomes $c_1 \\text{vol}(\\Omega_1) + c_2 \\text{vol}(\\Omega_2) = 0$. We can choose non-trivial constants, for example $c_1 = \\text{vol}(\\Omega_2)$ and $c_2 = -\\text{vol}(\\Omega_1)$. This function $u(x) = (\\text{vol}(\\Omega_2))\\chi_{\\Omega_1}(x) - (\\text{vol}(\\Omega_1))\\chi_{\\Omega_2}(x)$ has a zero global mean and a zero gradient. However, its $L^2$ norm (and the left-hand side of the inequality, $\\lVert u - \\Pi(u) \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)} = \\lVert u \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}$ since $\\bar{u}_\\Omega=0$) is non-zero. The Rayleigh quotient for this function is infinite. Thus, a Poincaré inequality with a finite constant does not hold.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option C (Component-wise mean-zero):** The constraints are $\\int_{\\Omega_1} u \\,dx = 0$ and $\\int_{\\Omega_2} u \\, dx = 0$. The projection is $\\Pi(u) = \\bar{u}_{\\Omega_1}\\chi_{\\Omega_1} + \\bar{u}_{\\Omega_2}\\chi_{\\Omega_2}$. The left-hand side of the inequality becomes:\n    $$ \\lVert u - \\Pi(u) \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\lVert u_1 - \\bar{u}_{\\Omega_1} \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2 + \\lVert u_2 - \\bar{u}_{\\Omega_2} \\rVert_{L^2(\\Omega_2)}^2 $$\n    These constraints effectively quotient out the constant functions on each component. On this restricted space, the problem decouples into two independent Neumann problems on $\\Omega_1$ and $\\Omega_2$. The analysis is analogous to the Dirichlet case. The constant $C_P^N(\\Omega;\\text{componentwise mean})$ is given by $\\max\\{C_P^N(\\Omega_1), C_P^N(\\Omega_2)\\}$. Like the Dirichlet constant, the Neumann-Poincaré constant $C_P^N(B_R)$ for a ball scales linearly with radius $R$. Therefore, the statement is completely analogous to the correct statement for the Dirichlet case. The constant is independent of $L$.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n-   **Option E (FEM Discretization):** This option discusses the numerical linear algebra consequences. The stiffness matrix $A$ for the weak form of the Neumann problem has entries $A_{ij} = \\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\phi_i \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_j \\, dx$. Its null space, at the discrete level, mirrors the null space of the continuous operator. It has a dimension equal to the number of connected components, which is $2$. The null vectors correspond to nodal vectors that are constant on each of the two discrete sub-domains. Imposing a single global mean-zero constraint eliminates one null mode (the globally constant vector), but a second mode remains. This remaining mode corresponds to a vector that is constant with value $c_1$ on the nodes of $\\Omega_1$ and constant with value $c_2$ on the nodes of $\\Omega_2$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are chosen to satisfy the discrete-level global mean-zero constraint. This implies $c_1$ and $c_2$ must have opposite signs. The resulting linear system is still singular. A discrete Poincaré inequality requires the stiffness matrix to be invertible on the constrained space. To achieve this, the entire 2-dimensional null space must be removed. This requires two independent constraints, such as enforcing a zero-mean condition on each component separately. The statement accurately describes this situation.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3432663"}, {"introduction": "In practical engineering and scientific problems, domains are often too complex for an analytical calculation of the Poincaré constant.

Formulate an algorithm that, on a given mesh, computes an estimator $C_{P,h}$ of $C_{P}$ by minimizing $\\mathcal{R}_{h}(\\cdot)$ over $V_{h}$ using a matrix generalized eigenvalue problem assembled from the standard bilinear forms associated with the Laplacian and the $L^{2}$ inner product.\n\n2. Justify convergence with mesh refinement under standard assumptions for conforming finite element spaces. In particular, argue why the minimizer of the discrete Rayleigh quotient yields a generalized eigenpair of the assembled stiffness and mass matrices, and why the smallest discrete eigenvalue converges to its continuous counterpart as the mesh size $h \\to 0$. Conclude monotone convergence of $C_{P,h}$ to $C_{P}$ for nested spaces and state the expected convergence rate in one spatial dimension with piecewise linear elements under sufficient regularity.\n\n3. Implement the above numerical procedure for the one-dimensional case $\\Omega = (0,L)$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$, using continuous, piecewise linear finite elements on a uniform mesh with $N$ elements. Assemble the stiffness matrix $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N-1)\\times(N-1)}$ and mass matrix $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N-1)\\times(N-1)}$ corresponding to the bilinear forms\n$$\na(u,v) = \\int_{0}^{L} u'(x) v'(x)\\,dx,\\qquad m(u,v) = \\int_{0}^{L} u(x) v(x)\\,dx,\n$$\nrestricted to the interior nodes because of the essential boundary conditions $u(0)=u(L)=0$. Use a symmetric eigenvalue solver to compute the smallest generalized eigenvalue $\\lambda_{h}$ satisfying\n$$\nK \\mathbf{u}_{h} = \\lambda_{h} \\, M \\mathbf{u}_{h},\n$$\nand set the estimator $C_{P,h} \\coloneqq 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_{h}}$.\n\n4. For verification on the interval, use the well-tested fact that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $-d^{2}/dx^{2}$ on $(0,L)$ equals $(\\pi/L)^{2}$, which implies the best constant $C_{P} = L/\\pi$. For each test case below, compute the absolute relative error\n$$\ne(L,N) \\coloneqq \\frac{\\left|\\,C_{P,h}(L,N) - \\left(L/\\pi\\right)\\,\\right|}{L/\\pi}.\n$$\n\nTest suite:\n\n- Case $\\#1$: $L=1$, $N=2$.\n- Case $\\#2$: $L=1$, $N=8$.\n- Case $\\#3$: $L=1$, $N=32$.\n- Case $\\#4$: $L=2.5$, $N=50$.\n\nAll quantities are dimensionless.

No other text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It presents a standard problem in the numerical analysis of partial differential equations, namely the approximation of eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator using the finite element method, and its connection to the Poincaré inequality. All definitions and parameters are clearly specified.\n\nThe solution proceeds in several steps, following the tasks outlined in the problem.\n\n### 1. Theoretical Formulation: From Poincaré Constant to a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem\n\nThe Poincaré inequality for functions $u$ in the Sobolev space $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ is given by\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\leq C_{P} \\,\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)},\n$$\nwhere $C_{P}$ is the smallest possible constant for which this inequality holds. For any non-zero function $u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$, we can rearrange the inequality to\n$$\n\\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}}{\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}} \\leq C_{P}^{2}.\n$$\nThe best constant $C_{P}$ is obtained by finding the supremum of the left-hand side over all admissible functions:\n$$\nC_{P}^{2} = \\sup_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}}{\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}}.\n$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the infimum of the reciprocal, which is the Rayleigh quotient $\\mathcal{R}(u)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{P}^{2}} = \\inf_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}}{\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}} = \\inf_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u(x)|^{2}\\,dx}{\\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx} \\coloneqq \\lambda_{1}.\n$$\nThe constant $\\lambda_{1}$ is the smallest eigenvalue of the negative Laplacian operator, $-\\Delta$, on $\\Omega$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation for the minimization of $\\mathcal{R}(u)$ is the weak form of the eigenvalue problem: find $u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ such that\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\,dx = \\lambda \\int_{\\Omega} u v \\,dx \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega).\n$$\nThe smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$ is the minimum value of $\\mathcal{R}(u)$, and the best Poincaré constant is thus $C_{P} = 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}}$.\n\nTo approximate this numerically, we introduce a finite-dimensional conforming finite element space $V_{h} \\subset H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$. The discrete problem is to find the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient restricted to this subspace:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,h} = \\min_{v_{h} \\in V_{h}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\mathcal{R}_{h}(v_{h}) = \\min_{v_{h} \\in V_{h}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v_{h}|^{2}\\,dx}{\\int_{\\Omega} |v_{h}|^{2}\\,dx}.\n$$\nLet $\\{\\phi_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{N_{dof}}$ be a basis for $V_{h}$. Any function $v_{h} \\in V_{h}$ can be written as a linear combination $v_{h}(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{dof}} c_{j} \\phi_{j}(x)$, where $\\mathbf{c} = [c_{1}, \\dots, c_{N_{dof}}]^{T}$ is the vector of coefficients. Substituting this into the discrete Rayleigh quotient gives:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{h}(v_{h}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{dof}}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{dof}} c_{i} c_{j} \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\phi_{i} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_{j}\\,dx}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{dof}}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{dof}} c_{i} c_{j} \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{i} \\phi_{j}\\,dx} = \\frac{\\mathbf{c}^{T} K \\mathbf{c}}{\\mathbf{c}^{T} M \\mathbf{c}},\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the stiffness matrix with entries $K_{ij} = a(\\phi_{j}, \\phi_{i}) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla\\phi_{i} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi_{j}\\,dx$, and $M$ is the mass matrix with entries $M_{ij} = m(\\phi_{j}, \\phi_{i}) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{i}\\phi_{j}\\,dx$. Minimizing this quotient with respect to the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$ is equivalent to solving the generalized eigenvalue problem:\n$$\nK \\mathbf{c} = \\lambda_{h} M \\mathbf{c}.\n$$\nThe minimum value of the quotient, $\\lambda_{1,h}$, is the smallest eigenvalue of this system. The resulting numerical estimator for the Poincaré constant is $C_{P,h} = 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1,h}}$.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Given a mesh of $\\Omega$, construct the finite element basis functions $\\{\\phi_{j}\\}$ for the space $V_{h}$. Due to the homogeneous boundary conditions, basis functions associated with boundary nodes are excluded.\n2. Assemble the $(N_{dof} \\times N_{dof})$ stiffness matrix $K$ and mass matrix $M$.\n3. Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem $K \\mathbf{c} = \\lambda_{h} M \\mathbf{c}$ for the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1,h}$.\n4. Calculate the Poincaré constant estimate as $C_{P,h} = 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1,h}}$.\n\n### 2. Convergence Analysis\n\nThe convergence of $C_{P,h}$ to $C_P$ relies on fundamental results from finite element theory for eigenvalue problems.\nThe continuous and discrete smallest eigenvalues are given by the minima of the Rayleigh quotient over $H_0^1(\\Omega)$ and $V_h$, respectively:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = \\min_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\mathcal{R}(u), \\quad \\lambda_{1,h} = \\min_{v_{h} \\in V_{h}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\mathcal{R}(v_{h}).\n$$\nSince the finite element space is conforming, $V_{h} \\subset H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$. The minimization over a smaller set $V_h$ cannot yield a value smaller than the minimum over the larger set $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$. Therefore, we have the inequality:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,h} \\geq \\lambda_{1}.\n$$\nThis implies that $C_{P,h} = 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1,h}} \\leq 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}} = C_{P}$. The numerical approximation provides a lower bound for the true Poincaré constant.\n\nIf a sequence of meshes is generated by refinement such that the mesh size $h \\to 0$, and the corresponding finite element spaces $V_h$ are nested ($V_{h'} \\subset V_h$ for $h < h'$), then the set of admissible functions for the minimization grows with each refinement. This leads to a monotonic decrease in the approximate eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,h'} \\ge \\lambda_{1,h} \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_{1}.\n$$\nConsequently, the sequence of approximate Poincaré constants $C_{P,h}$ converges monotonically from below to the true constant $C_P$.\n\nFor the convergence rate, standard approximation theory for elliptic eigenvalue problems states that if the first eigenfunction $u_1$ has sufficient regularity (e.g., $u_1 \\in H^{p+1}(\\Omega)$) and we use piecewise polynomial basis functions of degree $p$, the error in the eigenvalue approximation is\n$$\n|\\lambda_{1,h} - \\lambda_{1}| = \\lambda_{1,h} - \\lambda_{1} = O(h^{2p}).\n$$\nFor the one-dimensional case with piecewise linear elements ($p=1$), the first eigenfunction on $(0,L)$ is $u_1(x) = \\sin(\\pi x/L)$, which is infinitely differentiable. Thus, the required regularity is met, and we expect $|\\lambda_{1,h} - \\lambda_{1}| = O(h^2)$.\nThe error in the Poincaré constant can be estimated via a Taylor expansion:\n$$\nC_{P,h} = (\\lambda_{1,h})^{-1/2} = (\\lambda_1 + (\\lambda_{1,h} - \\lambda_1))^{-1/2} = \\lambda_1^{-1/2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\lambda_{1,h}-\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1} + O\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{1,h}-\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1}\\right)^2\\right)\\right).\n$$\nThis shows that $|C_{P,h} - C_P| = C_P - C_{P,h} = O(\\lambda_{1,h} - \\lambda_1) = O(h^2)$. The relative error is also expected to converge at a rate of $O(h^2)$.\n\n### 3. Implementation for the 1D Case\n\nFor $\\Omega = (0,L)$ with a uniform mesh of $N$ elements, the mesh size is $h = L/N$. The nodes are at $x_j = j h$ for $j=0, \\dots, N$. The degrees of freedom correspond to the $N-1$ interior nodes, $x_1, \\dots, x_{N-1}$. The basis functions are the standard piecewise linear \"hat\" functions $\\phi_j(x)$ for $j=1, \\dots, N-1$, where $\\phi_j(x_i) = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe entries of the stiffness matrix $K$ and mass matrix $M$ are computed by integrating products of these basis functions and their derivatives. For $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n- Stiffness matrix $K_{ij} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\phi_i'(x) \\phi_j'(x) \\,dx$:\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 2/h & \\text{if } i=j \\\\ -1/h & \\text{if } |i-j|=1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\n- Mass matrix $M_{ij} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\phi_i(x) \\phi_j(x) \\,dx$:\n$$\nM_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 2h/3 & \\text{if } i=j \\\\ h/6 & \\text{if } |i-j|=1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe resulting matrices $K, M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N-1)\\times(N-1)}$ are symmetric and tridiagonal:\n$$\nK = \\frac{1}{h} \\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & -1 & & \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 & \\\\\n& \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots \\\\\n& & -1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nM = \\frac{h}{6} \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 1 & & \\\\\n1 & 4 & 1 & \\\\\n& \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots \\\\\n& & 1 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThese matrices are used in the generalized eigenvalue problem $K \\mathbf{c} = \\lambda_h M \\mathbf{c}$.\n\n### 4. Verification and Error Calculation\n\nThe exact first eigenvalue of the operator $-d^2/dx^2$ on $(0,L)$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is $\\lambda_1 = (\\pi/L)^2$. The corresponding best Poincaré constant is $C_P = 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_1} = L/\\pi$. The numerical estimate $C_{P,h}$ is computed from the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1,h}$ of the discrete system. The absolute relative error is then calculated as specified:\n$$\ne(L,N) = \\frac{|C_{P,h}(L,N) - C_P|}{C_P}.\n$$", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import eigh\n\ndef assemble_matrices_and_solve(L, N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Assembles the stiffness and mass matrices for a 1D problem and solves the\n    generalized eigenvalue problem to find the smallest eigenvalue.\n\n    Args:\n        L (float): The length of the interval (0, L).\n        N (int): The number of finite elements.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The smallest generalized eigenvalue lambda_h.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of elements N must be at least 2 for interior nodes to exist.\")\n\n    # Mesh size\n    h = float(L) / N\n    # Number of degrees of freedom (interior nodes)\n    dof = N - 1\n\n    # Assemble stiffness matrix K\n    # K is a tridiagonal matrix with 2/h on the diagonal and -1/h on the off-diagonals.\n    diag_k = np.full(dof, 2.0 / h)\n    off_diag_k = np.full(dof - 1, -1.0 / h)\n    K = np.diag(diag_k) + np.diag(off_diag_k, k=1) + np.diag(off_diag_k, k=-1)\n    \n    # Assemble mass matrix M\n    # M is a tridiagonal matrix with 2h/3 on the diagonal and h/6 on the off-diagonals.\n    diag_m = np.full(dof, 2.0 * h / 3.0)\n    off_diag_m = np.full(dof - 1, h / 6.0)\n    M = np.diag(diag_m) + np.diag(off_diag_m, k=1) + np.diag(off_diag_m, k=-1)\n\n    # Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem K*u = lambda*M*u\n    # scipy.linalg.eigh returns eigenvalues in ascending order for symmetric matrices.\n    # K and M are symmetric.
