Therefore, there are no curves in the $(x,y)$-plane where the PDE becomes parabolic.\n\n**(4) Implications for Characteristic Curves and Numerical Schemes**\n\nSince the PDE is hyperbolic everywhere ($D(x) > 0$), it exhibits wave-like behavior throughout the domain.\n*   **Characteristic Curves**: For any point $(x,y)$, there exist two distinct families of real characteristic curves.

Numerical methods must respect the directionality of information flow defined by the characteristics. This typically involves using \"upwind\" schemes or other methods designed for hyperbolic conservation laws, which are often subject to a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability condition.

The problem specifies the coefficient for the $u_{xy}$ term as $2b$, where $b=1$.\nThe definition for the central scheme's mixed-derivative coefficient is:\n$$\nB_{d,\\mathrm{central}}(\\alpha,\\beta; h_x,h_y) = -\\dfrac{2 b}{h_x h_y} \\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(\\beta)\n$$\nWith $b=1$, this becomes:\n$$\nB_{d,\\mathrm{central}}(\\alpha,\\beta; h_x,h_y) = -\\dfrac{2}{h_x h_y} \\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(\\beta)\n$$\nThe definition for the upwind scheme's mixed-derivative coefficient is given by its real part:\n$$\nB_{d,\\mathrm{upwind}}(\\alpha,\\beta; h_x,h_y) = \\dfrac{2 b}{h_x h_y} \\left[\\cos(\\alpha) + \\cos(\\beta) - 1 - \\cos(\\alpha - \\beta)\\right]\n$$\nWith $b=1$, this becomes:\n$$\nB_{d,\\mathrm{upwind}}(\\alpha,\\beta; h_x,h_y) = \\dfrac{2}{h_x h_y} \\left[\\cos(\\alpha) + \\cos(\\beta) - 1 - \\cos(\\alpha - \\beta)\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting these into the simplified expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\alpha,\\beta; h_x,h_y) = \\left( \\dfrac{2}{h_x h_y} \\left[\\cos(\\alpha) + \\cos(\\beta) - 1 - \\cos(\\alpha - \\beta)\\right] \\right)^2 - \\left( -\\dfrac{2}{h_x h_y} \\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(\\beta) \\right)^2\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\left(\\frac{2}{h_x h_y}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{(h_x h_y)^2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\alpha,\\beta; h_x,h_y) = \\dfrac{4}{(h_x h_y)^2} \\left( \\left[\\cos(\\alpha) + \\cos(\\beta) - 1 - \\cos(\\alpha - \\beta)\\right]^2 - \\left[\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(\\beta)\\right]^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final formula that will be implemented to solve the problem. The procedure will involve creating a function that takes the parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, h_x, h_y)$ as input, calculates $\\Delta$ using this formula, and then applying this function to each of the five test cases provided in the problem statement. The angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ must be treated in radians as specified.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the difference in discrete discriminants between an upwind and a\n    central scheme for a given PDE, for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (alpha, beta, h_x, h_y)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.1, 0.1, 1.0, 1.0),\n        (np.pi / 2, np.pi / 2, 1.0, 1.0),\n        (np.pi, np.pi, 1.0, 1.0),\n        (np.pi / 2, np.pi / 2, 1.0, 2.0),\n        (0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each test case and compute the result.\n    for alpha, beta, hx, hy in test_cases:\n        # Calculate Delta = B_d_upwind^2 - B_d_central^2\n        # This is derived from Delta = D_upwind - D_central where the A*C term cancels.\n        \n        # We use the simplified formula derived in the solution:\n        # Delta = 4 / (hx*hy)^2 * ( (cos(a)+cos(b)-1-cos(a-b))^2 - (sin(a)sin(b))^2 )\n        \n        # Term inside the first square for upwind part\n        term_upwind = np.cos(alpha) + np.cos(beta) - 1.0 - np.cos(alpha - beta)\n        \n        # Term inside the square for central part\n        term_central = np.sin(alpha) * np.sin(beta)\n        \n        # The common pre-factor\n        pre_factor = 4.0 / (hx * hy)**2\n        \n        # Calculate Delta\n        delta = pre_factor * (term_upwind**2 - term_central**2)\n        \n        results.append(delta)\n\n    # Format the results into the required output string.\n    # e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3,result4,result5]\"\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join(map(str, results)) + \"]\"\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3371567"}]}
