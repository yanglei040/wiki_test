Pressure Tail Correction ($P_{\\text{tail}}$)**\n\nThe configurational part of the pressure is given by the virial, $P_{\\text{config}} = \\frac{1}{3V} \\left\\langle \\sum_{ij} \\mathbf{r}_{ij} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_{ij} \\right\\rangle$. With $\\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -u'(r_{ij}) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$, we have $\\mathbf{r}_{ij} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -r_{ij} u'(r_{ij})$.\nThe configurational pressure can be expressed as an integral:\n$$ P_{\\text{config}} = -\\frac{1}{6V} \\langle \\sum_{i \\ne j} r_{ij} u'(r_{ij}) \\rangle = -\\frac{2\\pi \\rho^2}{3} \\int_0^\\infty r^3 u'(r) g(r) dr $$\nThe pressure tail correction, $P_{\\text{tail}}$, is the contribution from interactions beyond $r_c$.

Validity of the $g(r) \\approx 1$ Approximation**\n\nThe approximation that the radial distribution function $g(r)$ is unity for distances $r$ greater than the cutoff $r_c$ is central to these derivations. It implies that the fluid is structurally uncorrelated beyond $r_c$. The physical validity of this assumption depends on several factors:\n- **State Point (Density and Temperature)**: The approximation is most accurate for systems with weak correlations at long range. This is typical of fluids at low to moderate densities ($\\rho$) and high temperatures ($T$). At low densities, particles are far apart, and correlations decay quickly. At high temperatures, the kinetic energy ($k_B T$) dominates the potential energy depth ($\\epsilon$), reducing the influence of interactions on fluid structure. Conversely, at high densities or low temperatures (approaching a liquid-gas or liquid-solid phase boundary), strong and long-ranged correlations develop, making $g(r)$ deviate significantly from $1$ even at large $r$, rendering the approximation inaccurate.\n- **Cutoff Radius ($r_c$)**: The choice of $r_c$ is critical. The radial distribution function for a liquid typically exhibits damped oscillations corresponding to successive solvation shells. The cutoff $r_c$ must be large enough to extend beyond these structured regions. A common practice is to choose $r_c \\ge 2.5\\sigma$, as this usually encompasses the first two coordination shells for a simple Lennard-Jones fluid, after which $g(r)$ is typically close to $1$. If $r_c$ is too small, cutting through regions where $g(r)$ is highly structured (e.g., near its first or second peak), the approximation fails severely.\n\nThe final expressions for the tail corrections are:\n$$ \\frac{U_{\\text{tail}}}{N} = 8\\pi \\rho \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^9} - \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r_c^3} \\right) $$\n$$ P_{\\text{tail}} = 16\\pi \\rho^2 \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{2\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^9} - \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r_c^3} \\right) $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 8\\pi \\rho \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^{9}} - \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{3r_c^{3}} \\right)  16\\pi \\rho^{2} \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{2\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^{9}} - \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{3r_c^{3}} \\right) \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3479664"}]}
