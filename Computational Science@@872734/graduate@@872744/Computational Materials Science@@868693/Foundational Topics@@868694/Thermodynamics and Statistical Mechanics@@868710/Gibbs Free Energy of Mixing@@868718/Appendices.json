This classification is performed using a two-step algorithm involving the curvature of the Gibbs free energy curve (the second derivative) and the tangent plane distance function.\n\nFirst, we establish the analytical expressions for the total molar Gibbs free energy of mixing, $G(x)$, and its first and second derivatives with respect to the composition $x \\equiv x_1$.\n\nThe total Gibbs free energy of mixing is given as the sum of an ideal and an excess term:\n$$G(x) = G^{\\text{id}}(x) + G^{E}(x)$$\nThe ideal mixing term is:\n$$G^{\\text{id}}(x) = RT \\left[ x \\ln x + (1 - x) \\ln(1 - x) \\right]$$\nThe excess term is given by a Redlich-Kister polynomial:\n$$G^{E}(x) = x(1-x)\\left[A_0 + A_1(2x - 1) + A_2(2x - 1)^2\\right]$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $A_0, A_1, A_2$ are interaction parameters.\n\nTo apply the stability criteria, we must derive the first and second derivatives of $G(x)$ with respect to $x$.\n\n**Step 1: First Derivative, $\\dfrac{dG}{dx}$**\n\nThe derivative of the ideal term is:\n$$\\dfrac{dG^{\\text{id}}}{dx} = RT \\left( \\dfrac{d}{dx}(x \\ln x) + \\dfrac{d}{dx}((1-x)\\ln(1-x)) \\right)$$\n$$\\dfrac{dG^{\\text{id}}}{dx} = RT \\left( (\\ln x + 1) + (-1 \\cdot \\ln(1-x) + (1-x) \\cdot \\frac{-1}{1-x}) \\right)$$\n$$\\dfrac{dG^{\\text{id}}}{dx} = RT (\\ln x + 1 - \\ln(1-x) - 1) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)$$\n\nThe derivative of the excess term, using the product rule, is:\n$$\\dfrac{dG^{E}}{dx} = \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(x(1-x)\\right) \\cdot \\left[A_0 + A_1(2x - 1) + A_2(2x - 1)^2\\right] + x(1-x) \\cdot \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left[A_0 + A_1(2x - 1) + A_2(2x - 1)^2\\right]$$\n$$\\dfrac{dG^{E}}{dx} = (1-2x)\\left[A_0 + A_1(2x - 1) + A_2(2x - 1)^2\\right] + x(1-x)\\left[2A_1 + 4A_2(2x-1)\\right]$$\n\nCombining these, the total first derivative is:\n$$\\dfrac{dG}{dx} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right) + (1-2x)\\left[A_0 + A_1(2x - 1) + A_2(2x - 1)^2\\right] + x(1-x)\\left[2A_1 + 4A_2(2x-1)\\right]$$\nThis expression represents the difference in chemical potentials, $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Derivative, $\\dfrac{d^2G}{dx^2}$**\n\nThe second derivative of the ideal term is:\n$$\\dfrac{d^2G^{\\text{id}}}{dx^2} = RT \\left( \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{-1}{1-x} \\right) = RT \\left( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{1-x} \\right) = \\frac{RT}{x(1-x)}$$\n\nThe second derivative of the excess term is found by differentiating $\\dfrac{dG^{E}}{dx}$. The calculation, although algebraically intensive, can be streamlined by expanding $G^E(x)$ in powers of $x$ and differentiating term by term with respect to each parameter $A_i$.\nFor the $A_0$ term: $\\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2} [A_0 x(1-x)] = \\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2} [A_0(x-x^2)] = -2A_0$.\nFor the $A_1$ term: $\\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2} [A_1 x(1-x)(2x-1)] = \\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2} [A_1(-2x^3+3x^2-x)] = A_1(-12x+6) = 6A_1(1-2x)$.\nFor the $A_2$ term: $\\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2} [A_2 x(1-x)(2x-1)^2] = \\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2} [A_2(-4x^4+8x^3-5x^2+x)] = A_2(-48x^2+48x-10)$.\n\nSumming these contributions, we obtain the second derivative of the excess term:\n$$\\dfrac{d^2G^{E}}{dx^2} = -2A_0 + 6A_1(1-2x) + A_2(-48x^2+48x-10)$$\n\nThe total second derivative is:\n$$\\dfrac{d^2G}{dx^2} = \\frac{RT}{x(1-x)} - 2A_0 + 6A_1(1-2x) + A_2(-48x^2+48x-10)$$\n\n**Step 3: Stability Classification Algorithm**\n\nThe stability classification proceeds as follows for a reference composition $x_0$:\n\n1.  **Local Stability (Spinodal Analysis):** The sign of the second derivative, $\\left.\\dfrac{d^2G}{dx^2}\\right|_{x_0}$, determines the local stability. If $\\left.\\dfrac{d^2G}{dx^2}\\right|_{x_0}  0$, the Gibbs free energy curve is locally concave, meaning the homogeneous phase is unstable to infinitesimal composition fluctuations. This condition defines the spinodal region. The mixture is classified as **unstable**. The numerical check is $\\left.\\dfrac{d^2G}{dx^2}\\right|_{x_0}  -\\tau_{\\text{curv}}$.\n\n2.  **Global Stability (Tangent Plane Criterion):** If $\\left.\\dfrac{d^2G}{dx^2}\\right|_{x_0} \\ge 0$, the mixture is locally stable or marginally stable. We must then assess its global stability against phase separation into two distinct phases. This is done using the tangent plane distance function, $T(x)$, which measures the vertical distance between the Gibbs energy curve $G(x)$ and the line tangent to the curve at $x_0$.\n    $$T(x) = G(x) - \\left( G(x_0) + \\left.\\dfrac{dG}{dx}\\right|_{x_0}(x - x_0) \\right)$$\n    By construction, $T(x_0)=0$. If $T(x) \\ge 0$ for all other compositions $x \\in (0,1)$, it means no other phase or combination of phases has a lower Gibbs energy than the homogeneous phase at $x_0$. The mixture is globally **stable**.\n    If, however, there exists some composition $x$ for which $T(x)  0$, it implies that a state (e.g., a two-phase mixture) exists with a lower Gibbs energy. The homogeneous phase at $x_0$ is thus **metastable**: stable against small fluctuations but unstable against large ones that could nucleate the more stable phase(s).\n\n    To check this, we numerically find the minimum value of $T(x)$ over the domain $x \\in (0,1)$, excluding an infinitesimal neighborhood of $x_0$ to avoid the trivial minimum.\n    $$T_{\\text{min}} = \\min_{x \\in (0,1),\\, x \\neq x_0} T(x)$$\n    If $T_{\\text{min}}  -\\tau_{\\text{tpdf}}$, the mixture is classified as **metastable**. Otherwise, it is classified as **stable**.\n\n**Step 4: Numerical Implementation**\n\nThe algorithm is implemented in Python. The functions for $G(x)$, $\\dfrac{dG}{dx}$, and $\\dfrac{d^2G}{dx^2}$ are defined based on the derived analytical expressions. For the minimization of $T(x)$, we use `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar`. The search domain $x \\in (0,1)$ is practically handled as $x \\in [\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$ to avoid numerical issues with the logarithm at the boundaries. The exclusion interval around $x_0$ is specified as having width $\\delta$, which we interpret as $[x_0-\\delta/2, x_0+\\delta/2]$. The minimization is performed over two disjoint intervals, $[\\varepsilon, x_0-\\delta/2]$ and $[x_0+\\delta/2, 1-\\varepsilon]$, and the lower of the two resulting minima is taken as $T_{\\text{min}}$. The final classifications are mapped to integers ($1$ for stable, $0$ for metastable, $-1$ for unstable) as requested.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs stability analysis for a binary mixture based on its Gibbs free energy of mixing.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define constants and numerical parameters\n    R = 8.31446261815324  # J mol^-1 K^-1\n    T = 298.0  # K\n    epsilon = 1e-9\n    delta = 1e-6\n    tau_curv = 1e-6  # J mol^-1\n    tau_tpdf = 1e-6  # J mol^-1\n\n    def g_mix(x, A0, A1, A2):\n        \"\"\"Computes the total molar Gibbs free energy of mixing G(x).\"\"\"\n        # Handle boundary cases for logarithm\n        if np.any(x = 0) or np.any(x >= 1):\n             # For evaluation within bounds [epsilon, 1-epsilon], this should not be reached often\n             # But as a safeguard for edge cases of optimizer\n             x_safe = np.clip(x, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)\n        else:\n             x_safe = x\n\n        g_ideal = R * T * (x_safe * np.log(x_safe) + (1 - x_safe) * np.log(1 - x_safe))\n        \n        y = 2 * x - 1\n        g_excess = x * (1 - x) * (A0 + A1 * y + A2 * y**2)\n        \n        return g_ideal + g_excess\n\n    def dg_dx(x, A0, A1, A2):\n        \"\"\"Computes the first derivative of G(x) with respect to x.\"\"\"\n        x_safe = np.clip(x, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)\n        dg_ideal_dx = R * T * np.log(x_safe / (1 - x_safe))\n        \n        y = 2 * x - 1\n        term1 = (1 - 2 * x) * (A0 + A1 * y + A2 * y**2)\n        term2 = x * (1 - x) * (2 * A1 + 4 * A2 * y)\n        dg_excess_dx = term1 + term2\n        \n        return dg_ideal_dx + dg_excess_dx\n\n    def d2g_dx2(x, A0, A1, A2):\n        \"\"\"Computes the second derivative of G(x) with respect to x.\"\"\"\n        x_safe = np.clip(x, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)\n        d2g_ideal_dx2 = R * T / (x_safe * (1 - x_safe))\n        \n        # Pre-calculated coefficients from analytical derivation\n        d2g_excess_dx2 = -2*A0 + 6*A1*(1-2*x) + A2*(-48*x**2 + 48*x - 10)\n        \n        return d2g_ideal_dx2 + d2g_excess_dx2\n\n    def tpdf(x, x0, A0, A1, A2, g_x0, dg_dx_x0):\n        \"\"\"Computes the tangent plane distance function T(x).\"\"\"\n        return g_mix(x, A0, A1, A2) - g_x0 - dg_dx_x0 * (x - x0)\n\n    # Test cases from the problem statement\n    test_cases = [\n        # (A0, A1, A2, x0)\n        (2000.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3),  # Expected: stable -> 1\n        (8000.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1),  # Expected: metastable -> 0\n        (8000.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5),  # Expected: unstable -> -1\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        A0, A1, A2, x0 = case\n        \n        # 1.
