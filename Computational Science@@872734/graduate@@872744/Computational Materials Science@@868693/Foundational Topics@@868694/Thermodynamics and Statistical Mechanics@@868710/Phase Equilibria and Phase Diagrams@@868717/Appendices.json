For a binary system, composition is represented by the atomic fraction of component $B$, denoted $x \\in [0,1]$, and the formation energy per atom of an ordered configuration at composition $x$ is denoted $E_f(x)$, measured in electronvolts per atom. At zero temperature ($T = 0$), thermodynamic stability is determined by minimizing the energy. A mixture of two phases at compositions $x_1$ and $x_2$ can realize any overall composition $x = \\lambda x_1 + (1-\\lambda)x_2$, with $0 \\le \\lambda \\le 1$, and has energy $E_{\\text{mix}}(x) = \\lambda E_f(x_1) + (1-\\lambda) E_f(x_2)$, assuming ideal phase separation and no interaction energy between phases in a two-phase mixture. A single-phase ordered compound at composition $x$ is stable if and only if it lies on the lower convex envelope of the set $\\{(x_i, E_f(x_i))\\}$, meaning that $E_f(x)$ cannot be lowered by decomposing into a mixture of other phases. The lower convex envelope is the lower convex hull in the two-dimensional plane where the horizontal axis is $x$ and the vertical axis is $E_f$.\n\nStarting from these thermodynamic and geometric principles, construct the lower convex hull of $E_f$ versus $x$ for each provided test set. Then, for each hull, identify:\n- The breakpoints (hull vertices) at compositions $x_i$ and their energies $E_f(x_i)$, both expressed in their appropriate units ($x$ is dimensionless as a fraction of component $B$, and energies must be expressed in electronvolts per atom).\n- The interior stable ordered compounds (those vertices strictly within $0  x  1$).\n- The two-phase composition intervals $(x_{\\text{low}}, x_{\\text{high}})$ between successive hull vertices where any composition in the open interval decomposes into the two endpoint phases. Report each interval as a pair $[x_{\\text{low}}, x_{\\text{high}}]$ of floats.\n- For each two-phase facet (tie-line) connecting successive hull vertices $(x_i, E_f(x_i))$ and $(x_{i+1}, E_f(x_{i+1}))$, compute:\n  1. The facet slope $m = \\dfrac{E_f(x_{i+1}) - E_f(x_i)}{x_{i+1} - x_i}$, reported in electronvolts per atom per composition fraction.\n  2. A unit normal vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}$ to the facet in the $(x, E_f)$-plane, oriented such that its energy component is negative (i.e., the second component of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}$ is $ 0$). For an edge vector $\\boldsymbol{v} = (x_{i+1} - x_i, E_f(x_{i+1}) - E_f(x_i))$ with $x_{i+1}  x_i$, define the (non-normalized) normal as $\\boldsymbol{n} = (E_f(x_{i+1}) - E_f(x_i), -(x_{i+1} - x_i))$, and obtain the unit normal by $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} = \\dfrac{\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{n} \\rVert}$, where $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert$ is the Euclidean norm.\n\nUse only the fundamental geometric operations implied by convexity and the definitions above; do not assume any specialized hull routines.

From this hull, several thermodynamic and geometric properties must be extracted. The solution approach is grounded in the fundamental principles of thermodynamic stability and computational geometry.\n\nAt $T=0$, the Gibbs free energy of a system is equal to its internal energy. For a binary alloy, the stable state at a given overall composition is the one that minimizes the total energy per atom. A single-phase ordered compound with composition $x_i$ and formation energy $E_f(x_i)$ is thermodynamically stable if and only if its corresponding point $(x_i, E_f(x_i))$ lies on the lower convex envelope of all possible configurations $\\{ (x_j, E_f(x_j)) \\}$. Any composition $x$ that falls between two stable compounds on the hull, say at $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$, will decompose into a two-phase mixture of these compounds. The energy of such a mixture lies on the straight line segment, or tie-line, connecting the points $(x_i, E_f(x_i))$ and $(x_{i+1}, E_f(x_{i+1}))$. This geometric construction is known as the convex hull of the formation energies.\n\nThe algorithm to solve this problem is implemented in three stages: data preprocessing, lower convex hull construction, and extraction of physical quantities.\n\n**Step 1: Data Preprocessing**\n\nFirst, the input data, consisting of compositions $x$ and formation energies $E_f$, must be prepared for the hull-finding algorithm.\n1.  **Duplicate Compositions**: The problem states that if multiple energy values exist for the same composition, only the point with the lowest energy is thermodynamically relevant. All other points at that composition are metastable or unstable with respect to it. We enforce this by using a dictionary or map data structure keyed by composition, ensuring only the minimum energy for each unique composition is retained.\n2.  **Endpoints**: The formation energy $E_f$ is defined relative to the pure elements. By definition, the formation energy of the pure components is zero. Therefore, the points $(0, 0)$ for pure component A and $(1, 0)$ for pure component B must be included in our set of points. We explicitly add or update these points to ensure they are present at $E_f=0$.\n3.  **Sorting**: The set of unique points is then sorted in ascending order based on the composition $x$. This is a prerequisite for the Monotone Chain algorithm used for hull construction. Let the sorted points be $p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{N-1}$, where $p_i = (x_i, E_f(x_i))$.\n\n**Step 2: Lower Convex Hull Construction**\n\nWe will implement the Monotone Chain algorithm (also known as Andrew's algorithm), adapted to find only the lower convex hull. This algorithm iterates through the sorted points and builds the hull incrementally. The core of the algorithm is the orientation test, which determines whether a sequence of three points constitutes a \"left\" or \"right\" turn. This test is performed using the 2D cross-product.\n\nFor three points $p_1=(x_1, y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2, y_2)$, and $p_3=(x_3, y_3)$, the cross-product 'z' component of the vectors $\\vec{p_1 p_2}$ and $\\vec{p_1 p_3}$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{cross\\_product}(p_1, p_2, p_3) = (x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (y_2 - y_1)(x_3 - x_1) $$\nThe sign of this value indicates the orientation:\n-   $ 0$: Counter-clockwise, or a \"left turn\" from $\\vec{p_1 p_2}$ to $\\vec{p_1 p_3}$.\n-   $ 0$: Clockwise, or a \"right turn\".\n-   $= 0$: The points are collinear.\n\nTo construct the lower hull, we iterate through the sorted points and maintain a stack, `lower_hull`, representing the vertices of the hull found so far. For each new point $p_i$, we check the orientation formed by the top two points on the stack (`lower_hull[-2]`, `lower_hull[-1]`) and the new point $p_i$. A lower hull must consist of a chain of \"left turns\" (or be straight). If adding $p_i$ creates a \"right turn\" or a straight line continuation, it means the last point on the stack, `lower_hull[-1]`, is not part of the `strictly` convex hull and lies above or on the new segment. Thus, it must be popped from the stack. This check is repeated until the sequence forms a left turn.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n- Initialize an empty list `lower_hull`.\n- For each point $p_i$ in the sorted list of points:\n  - While `lower_hull` contains at least two points and $\\text{cross\\_product}(\\text{lower\\_hull}[-2], \\text{lower\\_hull}[-1], p_i) \\le 0$:\n    - Pop the last point from `lower_hull`.\n  - Append $p_i$ to `lower_hull`.\n\nThe condition $\\le 0$ ensures that we pop points that form right turns or are collinear, correctly identifying the vertices of the strictly convex hull, which represent the stable compounds. The final `lower_hull` list contains the hull vertices (breakpoints) in order of increasing composition.\n\n**Step 3: Extraction of Physical Quantities**\n\nOnce the list of hull vertices, $\\{ (x_0, E_f(x_0)), (x_1, E_f(x_1)), \\dots, (x_k, E_f(x_k)) \\}$, is determined, we can derive the required properties.\n\n1.  **Breakpoint Compositions and Energies**: These are directly obtained by separating the $x$ and $E_f$ coordinates from the points in the final `lower_hull` list.\n2.  **Interior Stable Ordered Compounds**: These are the hull vertices whose compositions are strictly between $0$ and $1$. We iterate through the hull vertices and collect all $x_i$ such that $0  x_i  1$.\n3.  **Two-Phase Intervals**: Each edge of the convex hull represents a two-phase region. For each pair of successive vertices $(x_i, E_f(x_i))$ and $(x_{i+1}, E_f(x_{i+1}))$, the corresponding two-phase interval is $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$.\n4.  **Facet Slopes and Normals**: For each such successive pair of vertices, we compute the properties of the facet (tie-line) connecting them. Let the edge vector be $\\boldsymbol{v} = (x_{i+1} - x_i, E_f(x_{i+1}) - E_f(x_i)) = (\\Delta x, \\Delta E)$.\n    -   **Slope ($m$)**: The slope of the tie-line represents the common chemical potential of the components in the two-phase mixture.\n        $$ m = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{E_f(x_{i+1}) - E_f(x_i)}{x_{i+1} - x_i} $$\n    -   **Unit Normal Vector ($\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}$)**: The problem provides the formula for a normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n} = (\\Delta E, -\\Delta x)$, which is obtained by rotating the edge vector $\\boldsymbol{v} = (\\Delta x, \\Delta E)$ by $-90^\\circ$ and swapping components. Since the hull points are sorted by composition, $\\Delta x = x_{i+1} - x_i  0$. Therefore, the second component of $\\boldsymbol{n}$, which is $-\\Delta x$, is always negative, satisfying the specified orientation requirement. The unit normal vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}$ is found by dividing $\\boldsymbol{n}$ by its Euclidean norm, $\\lVert \\boldsymbol{n} \\rVert$:\n        $$ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{n} \\rVert} = \\frac{(\\Delta E, -\\Delta x)}{\\sqrt{(\\Delta E)^2 + (-\\Delta x)^2}} $$\n        The components of this vector, $[n_x, n_E]$, are appended to the results for each facet.\n\nThis comprehensive procedure, combining data sanitization, a classic geometric algorithm, and physics-based calculations, provides a robust and correct solution to the problem.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function that processes all test cases and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"x\": [0.0, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 0.75, 1.0],\n            \"E_f\": [0.0, -0.08, -0.15, -0.12, -0.14, -0.09, 0.0]\n        },\n        {\n            \"x\": [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0],\n            \"E_f\": [0.0, -0.05, -0.075, 0.0]\n        },\n        {\n            \"x\": [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0],\n            \"E_f\": [0.0, -0.10, -0.12, 0.0]\n        },\n        {\n            \"x\": [0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0],\n            \"E_f\": [0.0, -0.02, -0.14, -0.02, 0.0]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        case_result = compute_phase_diagram(case[\"x\"], case[\"E_f\"])\n        results.append(case_result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(json.dumps(results, separators=(',', ':')))\n\ndef compute_phase_diagram(compositions, energies):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the lower convex hull and derives thermodynamic properties for a single binary system.\n\n    Args:\n        compositions (list[float]): List of atomic fractions of component B.\n        energies (list[float]): List of formation energies in eV/atom.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing six lists:\n              1.

According to the second law of thermodynamics, the equilibrium state at constant temperature and pressure is the one that minimizes the total molar Gibbs energy of the system, subject to the constraint of mass conservation.\n\nThis problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. The goal is to find the values of the independent variables that minimize the total Gibbs energy $G_{\\text{tot}}$. The variables are the molar fraction of the ordered phase, $f_O$, the composition of the disordered phase, $x_B^D$, and the site fractions of component $B$ on the two sublattices of the ordered phase, $y_B^\\alpha$ and $y_B^\\beta$.\n\nThe total molar Gibbs energy of a two-phase mixture is given by:\n$$\nG_{\\text{tot}} = f_D G^D(x_B^D, T) + f_O G^O(y_B^\\alpha, y_B^\\beta, T)\n$$\nwhere $f_D = 1 - f_O$ is the molar fraction of the disordered phase. The minimization of $G_{\\text{tot}}$ is subject to the mass balance constraint, which ensures that the overall composition $\\bar{x}_B$ is conserved:\n$$\n(1 - f_O) x_B^D + f_O \\left( \\frac{y_B^\\alpha + y_B^\\beta}{2} \\right) = \\bar{x}_B\n$$\nHere, $x_B^O = (y_B^\\alpha + y_B^\\beta) / 2$ is the overall composition of the ordered phase. The variables are subject to physical bounds: $f_O \\in [0, 1]$, and the compositions $x_B^D, y_B^\\alpha, y_B^\\beta \\in (0, 1)$.\n\nThe Gibbs energy functions for each phase, $G^D$ and $G^O$, are provided in the problem statement. They are standard models from the CALPHAD methodology: a Redlich-Kister polynomial for the excess energy of the disordered solution and the Compound Energy Formalism (CEF) for the ordered phase.\n\nThe computational strategy to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Formulation for Numerical Optimization**: The problem is implemented using the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function, a powerful tool for constrained nonlinear optimization. The `SLSQP` (Sequential Least Squares Programming) algorithm is chosen as it is well-suited for problems with both equality constraints (the mass balance) and boundary constraints (the variable ranges).\n\n2.  **Objective Function and Constraints**: Python functions are defined to represent the objective function, $G_{\\text{tot}}(f_O, x_B^D, y_B^\\alpha, y_B^\\beta)$, and the equality constraint. The Gibbs energy functions for the individual phases, $G^D(x_B, T)$ and $G^O(y_B^\\alpha, y_B^\\beta, T)$, are implemented as separate helper functions.\n\n3.  **Numerical Stability**: The Gibbs energy expressions contain logarithmic terms of the form $z \\ln z$. As $z \\to 0$ or $z \\to 1$, the logarithm diverges, and its argument must be strictly positive. To ensure numerical stability, composition variables are clipped to a small interval $[\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$ (e.g., $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$) before being passed to a logarithm. The objective function is also carefully constructed to handle cases where a phase fraction is zero (e.g., $f_O = 0$), preventing multiplication of zero by a potentially undefined Gibbs energy (`nan`).\n\n4.  **Global Minimum Search**: The Gibbs energy landscape of a multi-phase system can be non-convex, meaning multiple local minima may exist. A simple gradient-based optimization might converge to a local minimum, which does not represent the true thermodynamic equilibrium. To address this and increase the likelihood of finding the global minimum, the optimization is initiated from multiple, physically-motivated starting points. The solution with the lowest final Gibbs energy across all runs is selected as the global equilibrium state.\n\n5.  **Selection of Starting Points**: The following set of initial guesses for the variable vector $[f_O, x_B^D, y_B^\\alpha, y_B^\\beta]$ is used to explore the solution space comprehensively:\n    *   A state of $100\\%$ disordered phase D: $[0.0, \\bar{x}_B, \\bar{x}_B, \\bar{x}_B]$.\n    *   A state of $100\\%$ ordered phase O: $[1.0, \\bar{x}_B, y_{B,eq}^\\alpha, y_{B,eq}^\\beta]$. The site fractions $y_{B,eq}^\\alpha$ and $y_{B,eq}^\\beta$ are pre-calculated by minimizing $G^O$ for the fixed overall composition $x_B^O = \\bar{x}_B$. This sub-minimization makes the starting point physically realistic.\n    *   Two-phase mixture states designed to probe for eutectoid-like configurations, such as an A-rich disordered phase coexisting with a B-rich (stoichiometric) ordered phase, and vice versa. Example guesses are $[0.5, 0.1, 0.01, 0.99]$ and $[0.5, 0.9, 0.99, 0.01]$.\n\nBy executing this robust optimization procedure for each $(T, \\bar{x}_B)$ pair provided in the test suite, we can deterministically compute the equilibrium state.

This practice [@problem_id:3474922] delves into the concept of local thermodynamic stability by asking you to identify the spinodal boundary, the limit beyond which a phase becomes unstable even to infinitesimal composition fluctuations. You will learn to map these unstable regions by analyzing the curvature of the Gibbs free energy surface—specifically, by checking the definiteness of its Hessian matrix—providing crucial insights into the kinetics of phase separation.", "problem": "You will write a complete, runnable program that implements a principled computation of spinodal boundaries in a ternary mixture at constant temperature and pressure by analyzing the loss of positive definiteness of the composition-constrained Hessian of the nondimensional molar Gibbs free energy. The fundamental base is the thermodynamic stability condition: at fixed temperature and pressure, local stability of a mixture requires that the second variation of the Gibbs free energy be positive for all allowed composition variations. For a ternary system with compositions $\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$, the mass conservation constraint imposes $x_1+x_2+x_3=1$, and a convenient independent coordinate choice is $(x_1,x_2)$ with $x_3=1-x_1-x_2$, where $0x_i1$. The nondimensional molar Gibbs free energy for a regular solution model may be written as\n$$\ng(\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i \\ln x_i + \\sum_{1\\le ij\\le 3} \\chi_{ij}\\, x_i x_j,\n$$\nwhere $\\chi_{ij}$ are dimensionless symmetric pair interaction parameters. The $2\\times 2$ reduced Hessian $\\mathbf{H}(x_1,x_2)$ is defined as the matrix of second partial derivatives of $g$ with respect to $(x_1,x_2)$ after eliminating $x_3$ via $x_3=1-x_1-x_2$. A composition is locally stable if and only if $\\mathbf{H}(x_1,x_2)$ is positive definite. The spinodal boundary is the locus where the smallest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{H}(x_1,x_2)$ vanishes, and the spinodal region is where this smallest eigenvalue is strictly negative. All quantities in this problem are dimensionless.\n\nYour program must:\n- Derive the explicit $2\\times 2$ Hessian $\\mathbf{H}(x_1,x_2)$ starting from the above definition of $g(\\mathbf{x})$ and the constraint $x_3=1-x_1-x_2$.\n- For each specified test case, discretize the interior of the composition triangle by a uniform grid of resolution $N$, meaning you consider points on the set $\\{(x_1,x_2): x_1=i/N,\\, x_2=j/N,\\, i,j\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0},\\, i+j\\le N\\}$ and exclude points with any $x_i$ less than a small cutoff $\\delta$ to avoid the singularity of $\\ln x_i$. Use $\\delta=10^{-6}$.\n- At each interior grid point, compute the smallest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{H}(x_1,x_2)$ and classify the point as unstable if this smallest eigenvalue is strictly less than $0$ within a numerical tolerance $\\tau=10^{-10}$, that is, if the smallest eigenvalue is less than $-\\tau$.\n- For each test case, compute two quantities:\n  1.

This involves deriving the analytical form of the stability matrix (the Hessian), and then evaluating it numerically over a discrete grid.\n\n#### Principle-Based Foundation\n\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, for a system at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ to be in a stable equilibrium, its Gibbs free energy must be at a minimum. This implies that for any infinitesimal fluctuation in composition, the second variation of the Gibbs free energy, $d^2g$, must be positive. The spinodal marks the limit of local stability, beyond which the system is unstable to infinitesimal composition fluctuations and will spontaneously separate into two or more phases. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the Hessian matrix of the Gibbs free energy ceases to be positive definite.\n\n#### Derivation of the Reduced Hessian Matrix\n\nThe nondimensional molar Gibbs free energy is given as:\n$$\ng(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1 \\ln x_1 + x_2 \\ln x_2 + x_3 \\ln x_3 + \\chi_{12}x_1x_2 + \\chi_{13}x_1x_3 + \\chi_{23}x_2x_3\n$$\nTo analyze stability, we must work with independent variables. We use the constraint $x_1+x_2+x_3=1$ to eliminate $x_3$, yielding a function of two variables, $g(x_1, x_2)$:\n$$\ng(x_1, x_2) = x_1 \\ln x_1 + x_2 \\ln x_2 + (1 - x_1 - x_2) \\ln(1 - x_1 - x_2) + \\chi_{12}x_1x_2 + \\chi_{13}x_1(1-x_1-x_2) + \\chi_{23}x_2(1-x_1-x_2)\n$$\nThe stability is determined by the $2 \\times 2$ reduced Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$, whose elements are the second partial derivatives of $g(x_1, x_2)$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}(x_1, x_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x_1^2}  \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_1}  \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x_2^2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe system is locally stable if and only if $\\mathbf{H}$ is positive definite. This requires its principal minors to be positive, which for a $2 \\times 2$ matrix is equivalent to requiring its trace and determinant to be positive, or equivalently, both its eigenvalues to be positive. The spinodal boundary occurs where the smallest eigenvalue becomes zero.\n\nLet's compute the elements of $\\mathbf{H}$. We can differentiate the ideal and excess parts of the energy separately.\nThe ideal part is $g_{ideal} = x_1 \\ln x_1 + x_2 \\ln x_2 + (1 - x_1 - x_2) \\ln(1 - x_1 - x_2)$. Its first derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{ideal}}{\\partial x_1} = \\ln x_1 - \\ln(1 - x_1 - x_2) = \\ln x_1 - \\ln x_3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{ideal}}{\\partial x_2} = \\ln x_2 - \\ln(1 - x_1 - x_2) = \\ln x_2 - \\ln x_3\n$$\nThe second derivatives of the ideal part are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g_{ideal}}{\\partial x_1^2} = \\frac{1}{x_1} + \\frac{1}{1-x_1-x_2} = \\frac{1}{x_1} + \\frac{1}{x_3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g_{ideal}}{\\partial x_2^2} = \\frac{1}{x_2} + \\frac{1}{1-x_1-x_2} = \\frac{1}{x_2} + \\frac{1}{x_3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g_{ideal}}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2} = \\frac{1}{1-x_1-x_2} = \\frac{1}{x_3}\n$$\nThe excess part is $g_{excess} = \\chi_{12}x_1x_2 + \\chi_{13}x_1(1-x_1-x_2) + \\chi_{23}x_2(1-x_1-x_2)$. Expanding this gives:\n$$\ng_{excess} = \\chi_{12}x_1x_2 + \\chi_{13}x_1 - \\chi_{13}x_1^2 - \\chi_{13}x_1x_2 + \\chi_{23}x_2 - \\chi_{23}x_1x_2 - \\chi_{23}x_2^2\n$$\nThe second derivatives of the excess part are constant:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g_{excess}}{\\partial x_1^2} = -2\\chi_{13}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g_{excess}}{\\partial x_2^2} = -2\\chi_{23}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g_{excess}}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2} = \\chi_{12} - \\chi_{13} - \\chi_{23}\n$$\nCombining the ideal and excess parts, the elements of the total Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ are:\n$$\nH_{11} = \\frac{1}{x_1} + \\frac{1}{x_3} - 2\\chi_{13}\n$$\n$$\nH_{22} = \\frac{1}{x_2} + \\frac{1}{x_3} - 2\\chi_{23}\n$$\n$$\nH_{12} = H_{21} = \\frac{1}{x_3} + \\chi_{12} - \\chi_{13} - \\chi_{23}\n$$\nwhere $x_3 = 1 - x_1 - x_2$.\n\n#### Algorithmic Implementation\n\nThe computational procedure is designed to systematically apply the stability criterion across the composition space.\n\n1.  **Discretize Composition Space**: The continuous composition triangle is replaced by a discrete grid of points. For a given resolution $N$, we generate points $(x_1, x_2)$ where $x_1 = i/N$ and $x_2 = j/N$ for integers $i, j \\ge 0$ such that $i+j \\le N$.\n\n2.  **Filter Interior Points**: The Gibbs free energy is singular at the boundaries where any $x_i=0$. To avoid this and focus on the interior of the phase diagram, we exclude any grid point where $x_1$, $x_2$, or $x_3$ is less than a small cutoff $\\delta = 10^{-6}$. This is equivalent to ensuring $i  0$, $j  0$, and $i+j  N$ for sufficiently large $N$. We iterate through all grid points, count the total number of valid interior points, and apply the stability test.\n\n3.  **Stability Test at Each Point**: For each valid grid point $(x_1, x_2)$:\n    a. We construct the $2 \\times 2$ numerical Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}(x_1, x_2)$ using the derived analytical formulae and the given $\\chi_{ij}$ parameters.\n    b. We compute the two real eigenvalues of this symmetric matrix. The most numerically stable way to do this is using a dedicated eigenvalue solver, such as `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh`.\n    c. We identify the smaller of the two eigenvalues, $\\lambda_{min}$.\n    d. The point is classified as unstable if $\\lambda_{min}  -\\tau$, where $\\tau = 10^{-10}$ is a numerical tolerance to guard against floating-point inaccuracies near zero. The number of such unstable points is counted.\n\n4.  **Calculate Outputs**:\n    a. **Unstable Fraction**: After checking all interior grid points, the fraction of unstable points is computed as the ratio of the unstable point count to the total number of interior points evaluated. This fraction is rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n    b. **Equimolar Stability**: A separate calculation is performed for the specific equimolar composition $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 1/3$. The Hessian is computed at this point, its smallest eigenvalue found, and the instability criterion $\\lambda_{min}  -\\tau$ is checked to yield a boolean result.\n\n5.  **Final Formatting**: The results for all test cases (each comprising the unstable fraction and the equimolar stability boolean) are collected and formatted into the specified single-line string format.\n\nThis principled, step-by-step procedure provides a robust and accurate method for mapping the spinodal region as defined by the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes spinodal boundaries for a ternary mixture based on the regular solution model.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    test_cases = [\n        {'chi_params': (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), 'N': 120},  # Case 1\n        {'chi_params': (3.5, 3.5, 3.5), 'N': 120},  # Case 2\n        {'chi_params': (2.8, 0.8, 3.2), 'N': 100},  # Case 3\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        chi_params = case['chi_params']\n        N = case['N']\n        \n        # Calculate properties for the current test case\n        result = calculate_spinodal_properties(chi_params, N)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Format the final output string as per requirements\n    # e.g., [[f1,b1],[f2,b2],[f3,b3]] with lowercase booleans\n    formatted_results = []\n    for f_val, b_val in results:\n        # Round the float to 6 decimal places\n        f_val_rounded = round(f_val, 6)\n        # Convert boolean to lowercase string 'true' or 'false'\n        b_val_str = str(b_val).lower()\n        formatted_results.append(f\"[{f_val_rounded},{b_val_str}]\")\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\n\ndef calculate_spinodal_properties(chi_params, N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the fraction of unstable points on a grid and checks stability at the equimolar point.\n\n    Args:\n        chi_params (tuple): A tuple of (chi_12, chi_13, chi_23).\n        N (int): The grid resolution.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing [unstable_fraction, is_equimolar_unstable].\n    \"\"\"\n    chi12, chi13, chi23 = chi_params\n    delta = 1e-6\n    tau = 1e-10\n\n    unstable_count = 0\n    total_points = 0\n\n    # Discretize the composition triangle and evaluate stability at each point\n    for i in range(N + 1):\n        for j in range(N - i + 1):\n            x1 = i / N\n            x2 = j / N\n            x3 = 1.0 - x1 - x2\n\n            # Exclude points near the boundary as per the cutoff delta\n            if x1  delta or x2  delta or x3  delta:\n                continue\n\n            total_points += 1\n\n            # Compute the Hessian matrix elements\n            H11 = 1/x1 + 1/x3 - 2 * chi13\n            H22 = 1/x2 + 1/x3 - 2 * chi23\n            H12 = 1/x3 + chi12 - chi13 - chi23\n            \n            H = np.array([[H11, H12], [H12, H22]])\n\n            # Compute eigenvalues and check for instability\n            min_eig = np.linalg.eigvalsh(H)[0]\n            if min_eig  -tau:\n                unstable_count += 1\n    \n    fraction_unstable = 0.0\n    if total_points > 0:\n        fraction_unstable = unstable_count / total_points\n\n    # Separately evaluate stability at the equimolar composition\n    x_eq = 1.0 / 3.0\n    H11_eq = 1/x_eq + 1/x_eq - 2 * chi13\n    H22_eq = 1/x_eq + 1/x_eq - 2 * chi23\n    H12_eq = 1/x_eq + chi12 - chi13 - chi23\n    \n    H_eq = np.array([[H11_eq, H12_eq], [H12_eq, H22_eq]])\n    \n    min_eig_eq = np.linalg.eigvalsh(H_eq)[0]\n    is_equimolar_unstable = min_eig_eq  -tau\n    \n    return [fraction_unstable, is_equimolar_unstable]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "3474922"}]}
