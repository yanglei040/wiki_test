The path is discretized into $N = 5$ images, indexed $i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. The endpoints are fixed at the potential minima, $x_{0} = -1/\\sqrt{2}$ and $x_{4} = +1/\\sqrt{2}$. The initial positions of the three intermediate images are $x_{1}^{(0)} = -0.35$, $x_{2}^{(0)} = 0.02$, and $x_{3}^{(0)} = 0.40$. The update rule for the positions is a steepest-descent step: $x_{i}^{(1)} = x_{i}^{(0)} + \\eta\\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\\text{tot}}$, where the total force is $\\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\\text{tot}} = F_{i}^{\\perp} + F_{i}^{\\text{spr},\\parallel}$ and the step size is $\\eta = 0.2$. We will perform this update for the movable images $i = 1, 2, 3$.\n\nFirst, we define the forces acting on each image. The potential (or \"true\") force is given by the negative gradient of the potential:\n$$F_{i}^{V} = -\\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_{i}} = -\\left(4x_{i}^{3} - 2x_{i}\\right) = 2x_{i} - 4x_{i}^{3}$$\nThe problem defines two components of the force used in the NEB update: the perpendicular component of the potential force, $F_{i}^{\\perp}$, and the parallel component of the spring force, $F_{i}^{\\text{spr},\\parallel}$.\n\nLet's analyze the perpendicular force component, $F_{i}^{\\perp} = F_{i}^{V} - \\left(F_{i}^{V} \\cdot \\hat{\\tau}_{i}\\right)\\hat{\\tau}_{i}$. In a one-dimensional system, all vectors (positions, forces, tangents) are collinear. The tangent vector $\\hat{\\tau}_{i}$ points along the path. Since the initial path coordinates are monotonically increasing ($x_{0}^{(0)} < x_{1}^{(0)} < x_{2}^{(0)} < x_{3}^{(0)} < x_{4}^{(0)}$), the tangent vector for each image can be represented by the scalar $\\hat{\\tau}_{i} = +1$. The potential force $F_{i}^{V}$ is also a scalar in this one-dimensional context. The dot product $\\left(F_{i}^{V} \\cdot \\hat{\\tau}_{i}\\right)$ becomes simple scalar multiplication: $F_{i}^{V} \\times 1 = F_{i}^{V}$.\nTherefore, the perpendicular component of the potential force is:\n$$F_{i}^{\\perp} = F_{i}^{V} - (F_{i}^{V})(1) = 0$$\nThis is a known consequence of the standard NEB formulation in one dimension: the potential force is entirely projected out, and the images move only under the influence of the spring force component, which acts to equalize the spacing between images. Although the problem is under the topic of CI-NEB, we are instructed not to use the climbing image modification, which is a mechanism to overcome this specific behavior at the saddle point.\n\nThe second force component is the parallel component of the spring force:\n$$F_{i}^{\\text{spr},\\parallel} = k\\left(\\left|x_{i+1} - x_{i}\\right| - \\left|x_{i} - x_{i-1}\\right|\\right)\\hat{\\tau}_{i}$$\nWith the spring constant $k = 1$ and tangent $\\hat{\\tau}_{i} = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$F_{i}^{\\text{spr},\\parallel} = \\left|x_{i+1} - x_{i}\\right| - \\left|x_{i} - x_{i-1}\\right|$$\n\nNow we can calculate the forces and updated positions for each movable image.

The final per-test result must be a boolean.\n\nTest Suite. Implement the following four independent test cases. In each case, $\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ stacks all atomic Cartesian coordinates as $(x_1,y_1,z_1,\\ldots,x_N,y_N,z_N)$, and the provided geometry is the converged climbing image (a stationary point on $V$). All energies and coordinates are dimensionless.\n\n- Test $1$ (single-atom quartic saddle, happy path):\n  - $N=1$.\n  - Potential $V(\\mathbf{x}) = a x^4 - b x^2 + \\frac{k}{2}(y^2+z^2)$ with parameters $a=1.0$, $b=1.5$, $k=2.0$.\n  - Climbing image geometry $\\mathbf{x}=(0,0,0)$.\n\n- Test $2$ (two-atom central potential with a radial quartic barrier, translational and rotational zero modes):\n  - $N=2$.\n  - Let $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1$, $r=\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|$. Potential $V(\\mathbf{x})=a(r-r_c)^4 - b(r-r_c)^2$ with $a=1.0$, $b=2.0$, $r_c=1.0$.\n  - Climbing image geometry $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(1.0,0,0)$, so $r=r_c$.\n\n- Test $3$ (three-atom index-$1$ saddle built from a linear reaction coordinate):\n  - $N=3$.\n  - Let a fixed unit vector $\\mathbf{w}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{9}$ define the reaction coordinate $s=\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}$, and define the orthogonal projection $\\mathbf{P}_\\perp=\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{w}\\mathbf{w}^\\top$, so that $\\mathbf{P}_\\perp \\mathbf{x}$ extracts components orthogonal to $\\mathbf{w}$. Potential\n    $$\n    V(\\mathbf{x}) = a s^4 - b s^2 + \\frac{k}{2}\\|\\mathbf{P}_\\perp \\mathbf{x}\\|^2,\n    $$\n    with $a=1.0$, $b=1.0$, $k=0.7$. Use the explicit vector\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{w}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}\\,[1,\\,-1,\\,0,\\,0,\\,0,\\,1,\\,0,\\,0,\\,-1]^\\top,\n    $$\n    which is already normalized. Climbing image geometry $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^9$.\n\n- Test $4$ (single-atom saddle with near-zero transverse stiffness, edge case for tolerance):\n  - $N=1$.\n  - Potential $V(\\mathbf{x}) = a x^4 - b x^2 + \\frac{k_\\perp}{2}(y^2+z^2)$ with $a=1.0$, $b=1.0$, $k_\\perp=10^{-8}$.\n  - Climbing image geometry $\\mathbf{x}=(0,0,0)$.\n\nRequired Output. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of lowercase boolean literals enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[\\text{true},\\text{false},\\text{true},\\text{true}]$), corresponding in order to Tests $1$ through $4$.\n\nScoring Criterion. For each test, return $\\text{true}$ if and only if there is exactly $1$ negative eigenvalue and exactly $3N-1$ non-negative eigenvalues; otherwise return $\\text{false}$. The program must be self-contained, require no user input, and use the specified numerical parameters $h=10^{-4}$ and $\\tau=10^{-6}$.", "solution": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the Hessian verification for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Global parameters as defined in the problem statement\n    H_STEP = 1e-4\n    EIG_TOLERANCE = 1e-6\n\n    def calculate_hessian(V_func, x0, D, h):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the Hessian matrix for a potential V_func at point x0.\n\n        Args:\n            V_func (callable): The potential energy function V(x).\n            x0 (np.ndarray): The point at which to calculate the Hessian.\n            D (int): The dimension of the coordinate space (3*N).\n            h (float): The step size for finite differences.\n\n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: The D x D Hessian matrix.\n        \"\"\"\n        H = np.zeros((D, D))\n        V0 = V_func(x0)\n\n        # Diagonal elements H_ii\n        for i in range(D):\n            x_p = x0.copy()\n            x_m = x0.copy()\n            x_p[i] += h\n            x_m[i] -= h\n            V_p = V_func(x_p)\n            V_m = V_func(x_m)\n            H[i, i] = (V_p - 2 * V0 + V_m) / (h**2)\n\n        # Off-diagonal elements H_ij\n        for i in range(D):\n            for j in range(i + 1, D):\n                x_pp = x0.copy()\n                x_pm = x0.copy()\n                x_mp = x0.copy()\n                x_mm = x0.copy()\n\n                x_pp[i] += h\n                x_pp[j] += h\n\n                x_pm[i] += h\n                x_pm[j] -= h\n\n                x_mp[i] -= h\n                x_mp[j] += h\n\n                x_mm[i] -= h\n                x_mm[j] -= h\n\n                V_pp = V_func(x_pp)\n                V_pm = V_func(x_pm)\n                V_mp = V_func(x_mp)\n                V_mm = V_func(x_mm)\n                \n                val = (V_pp - V_pm - V_mp + V_mm) / (4 * h**2)\n                H[i, j] = val\n                H[j, i] = val\n        \n        return H\n\n    def verify_saddle_point(V_func, x0, N, h, tau):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifies if a point is a first-order saddle point.\n        \n        Args:\n            V_func (callable): The potential energy function V(x).\n            x0 (np.ndarray): The geometry of the climbing image.\n            N (int): The number of atoms.\n            h (float): The finite difference step size.\n            tau (float): The tolerance for classifying eigenvalues.\n            \n        Returns:\n            bool: True if there is exactly 1 negative eigenvalue, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        D = 3 * N\n        hessian = calculate_hessian(V_func, x0, D, h)\n        \n        # Use np.linalg.eigh for symmetric matrices\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvalsh(hessian)\n        \n        negative_eigenvalue_count = np.sum(eigenvalues  -tau)\n        \n        # The condition for a first-order saddle point is exactly one negative eigenvalue.\n        # The total number of eigenvalues is 3N.
