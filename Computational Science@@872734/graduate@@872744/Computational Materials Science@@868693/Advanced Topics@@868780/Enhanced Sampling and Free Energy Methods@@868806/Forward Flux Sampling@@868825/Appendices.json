The goal is to detect and record first-crossing points of the interface $\\lambda_0$ that originate from the basin $\\mathcal{A}$, defined by $\\lambda  \\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$, using only discrete samples and an assumption of continuity between samples. The forward flux estimate must account for finite time-step discretization by interpolating the continuous-time crossing within a discrete interval.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Consider a stochastic trajectory $x(t)$ evolving under physically realistic dynamics (for example, overdamped Langevin dynamics) so that the reaction coordinate $\\lambda(t) = \\lambda(x(t))$ is continuous in time $t$.\n- The forward flux from basin $\\mathcal{A}$ across the first interface $\\lambda_0$ is defined as $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{A},0} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} N_{\\mathrm{fc}}(T)/T$, where $N_{\\mathrm{fc}}(T)$ is the number of first-crossing events of $\\lambda_0$ originating from $\\mathcal{A}$ during the time interval of length $T$.\n- A first-crossing event is counted only when the system has been in basin $\\mathcal{A}$ since the last counted first-crossing and then crosses from $\\lambda  \\lambda_0$ to $\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_0$ for the first time after that return to $\\mathcal{A}$.\n- Because only discrete samples are available, assume $\\lambda(t)$ is continuous and approximately linear between adjacent samples to resolve the continuous-time crossing within each discrete time step.\n\nYour program must implement the following, using the assumptions and definitions above:\n1. Given a time series $\\{(t_i, \\lambda_i)\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$ with strictly increasing times $t_0  t_1  \\dots  t_{N-1}$, and thresholds $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $\\lambda_0$ with $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}  \\lambda_0$, detect all first-crossing events of $\\lambda_0$ that originate from $\\mathcal{A}$.\n2. Treat a crossing within a discrete interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$ by linear interpolation: if $\\lambda_i  \\lambda_0 \\le \\lambda_{i+1}$ and the trajectory is eligible (i.e., it has returned to $\\mathcal{A}$ since the last counted crossing), then estimate the continuous-time crossing by\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{cross}} = t_i + \\frac{\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_i}{\\lambda_{i+1} - \\lambda_i}\\,(t_{i+1} - t_i).\n$$\n3. Eligibility logic for counting a first-crossing event must follow the renewal property: after counting a first-crossing, do not count another crossing until the trajectory returns to basin $\\mathcal{A}$, which occurs at any time when $\\lambda(t)  \\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$. In discrete time, implement this by setting an eligibility flag to true if either $\\lambda_i  \\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$ or there exists a linearized crossing into $\\lambda  \\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$ between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$, and setting the flag to false immediately after a counted first-crossing.\n4. Output the estimated flux $\\widehat{\\Phi}_{\\mathcal{A},0} = N_{\\mathrm{fc}}/(t_{N-1}-t_0)$ with units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the integer number $N_{\\mathrm{fc}}$ of first-crossing events, and the list of estimated crossing times in seconds.\n5. All times must be expressed in seconds and the flux in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Round all reported times to $10^{-6}$ seconds and the flux to $10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nTest Suite:\nImplement your algorithm for the following five test cases. In each case, use the specified $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $\\lambda_0$, construct the time series $\\{(t_i,\\lambda_i)\\}$ as described, and compute the outputs as defined above.\n\n- Test Case 1 (happy path, multiple well-resolved crossings):\n    - Thresholds: $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}} = 0.2$, $\\lambda_0 = 1.0$.\n    - Time grid: $t_i = i\\,\\Delta t$ for $i = 0,1,\\dots,40$ with $\\Delta t = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{s}$, so $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{40} = 20$.\n    - Trajectory: a triangular wave oscillating between $-0.3$ and $1.3$ with period $P = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$, defined by\n    $$\n    \\lambda(t) = c + A\\left(1 - 4\\,\\left|\\frac{(t \\bmod P)}{P} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right|\\right),\n    $$\n    where $A = 0.8$ and $c = 0.5$.\n    - Expected behavior: one first-crossing per period; ensure no double counting on downward crossings.\n\n- Test Case 2 (boundary condition: crossing exactly at a sample time):\n    - Thresholds: $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}} = 0.2$, $\\lambda_0 = 1.0$.\n    - Times: $t_i = 0, 0.25, 0.5, \\dots, 2.0$ seconds.\n    - Trajectory: ramp up then down,\n    $$\n    \\lambda(t) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n    t,  0 \\le t \\le 1, \\\\\n    2 - t,  1  t \\le 2.\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    - Expected behavior: a single first-crossing at $t = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$, exactly coincident with a sample.\n\n- Test Case 3 (interpolation-detected crossing between samples):\n    - Thresholds: $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}} = 0.2$, $\\lambda_0 = 1.0$.\n    - Times: $t = [0.0, 0.6, 1.2, 2.0]$ seconds.\n    - Values: $\\lambda = [0.0, 0.9, 1.1, 0.0]$.\n    - Expected behavior: one first-crossing detected within the interval $[0.6, 1.2]$ seconds via interpolation.\n\n- Test Case 4 (no crossings):\n    - Thresholds: $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}} = 0.2$, $\\lambda_0 = 1.0$.\n    - Times: $t_i = i\\,\\Delta t$ for $i = 0,1,\\dots,10$ with $\\Delta t = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{s}$, so $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{10} = 5$.\n    - Trajectory: low-amplitude oscillation always below $\\lambda_0$,\n    $$\n    \\lambda(t) = 0.1 + 0.05\\sin\\left(2\\pi \\frac{t}{2.0}\\right).\n    $$\n\n- Test Case 5 (recrossing of $\\lambda_0$ without prior return to $\\mathcal{A}$; ensure no double counting):\n    - Thresholds: $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}} = 0.2$, $\\lambda_0 = 1.0$.\n    - Times: $t = [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]$ seconds.\n    - Values: $\\lambda = [0.0, 1.1, 0.8, 1.2, 0.1]$.\n    - Expected behavior: count only the first upward crossing; do not count the second upward crossing at $t \\in [2.0, 3.0]$ because there has been no return to $\\mathcal{A}$ between them.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For each test case, output a three-element list of the form $[\\widehat{\\Phi}_{\\mathcal{A},0}, N_{\\mathrm{fc}}, [t_{\\mathrm{cross},1}, t_{\\mathrm{cross},2}, \\dots]]$, where the flux is in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ rounded to $10^{-6}$, the number of crossings is an integer, and the list contains the crossing times in seconds rounded to $10^{-6}$.

The core of the problem lies in correctly identifying first-crossing events of an interface $\\lambda_0$ that originate from a basin $\\mathcal{A}$, while accounting for the discrete sampling of a continuous-time process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System Dynamics**: A stochastic trajectory $x(t)$ with a continuous reaction coordinate $\\lambda(t) = \\lambda(x(t))$.\n- **Input Data**: A time series $\\{(t_i, \\lambda_i)\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$ with strictly increasing times $t_0  t_1  \\dots  t_{N-1}$.\n- **Thresholds**: A basin threshold $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$ and an interface threshold $\\lambda_0$, with $\\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}  \\lambda_0$.\n- **Basin Definition**: Basin $\\mathcal{A}$ is the region where $\\lambda  \\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n- **Forward Flux Definition**: $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{A},0} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} N_{\\mathrm{fc}}(T)/T$, where $N_{\\mathrm{fc}}(T)$ is the number of first-crossing events in time $T$.\n- **First-Crossing Event**: A trajectory crosses from $\\lambda  \\lambda_0$ to $\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_0$ for the first time after having returned to basin $\\mathcal{A}$.\n- **Crossing Time Estimation**: If a crossing occurs in $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$ (i.e., $\\lambda_i  \\lambda_0 \\le \\lambda_{i+1}$), the crossing time is estimated by linear interpolation:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{cross}} = t_i + \\frac{\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_i}{\\lambda_{i+1} - \\lambda_i}\\,(t_{i+1} - t_i) $$\n- **Eligibility Logic (Renewal Property)**: An eligibility flag is used.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe fundamental quantity of interest is the forward flux, $\\Phi_{\\mathcal{A},0}$, from a basin $\\mathcal{A}$ across an interface $\\lambda_0$. This is defined as the rate of independent first-passage events. A first-passage, or first-crossing, event is registered when the system's reaction coordinate $\\lambda(t)$ crosses the value $\\lambda_0$ in the forward direction (i.e., from $\\lambda  \\lambda_0$ to $\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_0$). Crucially, for the event to be counted, it must be the *first* such crossing after the trajectory has visited the basin $\\mathcal{A}$ (defined by $\\lambda  \\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$) since the previously counted crossing event. This renewal requirement is essential to ensure that the counted events are statistically independent transitions.\n\nGiven a discrete time series $\\{ (t_i, \\lambda_i) \\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$, an algorithm must be constructed to correctly identify these renewal events from the sampled data. The algorithm can be rigorously conceptualized as a finite state machine that tracks the trajectory's history relative to the crossing and renewal conditions. The machine has two states:\n\n1.  **$\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{eligible}}$**: The system is eligible to register a first-crossing of the interface $\\lambda_0$. A trajectory enters this state initially and after each successful return to basin $\\mathcal{A}$.\n2.  **$\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{ineligible}}$**: The system has just registered a first-crossing of $\\lambda_0$ and is now ineligible to register another until it fulfills the renewal condition by returning to basin $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nThe algorithm to process the time series proceeds as follows:\n\n**Initialization**:\n- The total duration of the trajectory is calculated as $T = t_{N-1} - t_0$.\n- The number of first crossings, $N_{\\mathrm{fc}}$, is initialized to $0$.\n- An empty list is created to store the computed crossing times, $t_{\\mathrm{cross}}$.\n- The system state is initialized to $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{eligible}}$. This is consistent with the standard FFS procedure where the initial simulation is started from a configuration deep within the basin $\\mathcal{A}$, thus satisfying the renewal condition by default before the first event.\n\n**Iteration**:\nThe algorithm iterates through all consecutive time point pairs, from the index $i=0$ to $i=N-2$, analyzing the interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$. Within each iteration, the state of the system dictates the actions:\n\n- **If the system is in state $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{eligible}}$**:\n    - The algorithm checks for a forward crossing of the interface $\\lambda_0$. This condition is met if $\\lambda_i  \\lambda_0$ and $\\lambda_{i+1} \\ge \\lambda_0$.\n    - If a crossing is detected:\n        1.  $N_{\\mathrm{fc}}$ is incremented by $1$.\n        2.  The time of crossing, $t_{\\mathrm{cross}}$, is estimated via the provided linear interpolation formula. This approximation assumes $\\lambda(t)$ behaves linearly on the small interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$:\n            $$ t_{\\mathrm{cross}} = t_i + \\frac{\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_i}{\\lambda_{i+1} - \\lambda_i}\\,(t_{i+1} - t_i) $$\n            This value is appended to the list of crossing times.\n        3.  The system state immediately transitions to $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{ineligible}}$ to prevent counting subsequent crossings before a renewal.\n\n- **If the system is in state $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{ineligible}}$**:\n    - The algorithm checks for the renewal condition. The system is considered to have returned to basin $\\mathcal{A}$ if its reaction coordinate is observed to be in the basin at the end of the current interval, i.e., if $\\lambda_{i+1}  \\lambda_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n    - If the renewal condition is met:\n        1.  The system state transitions back to $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{eligible}}$. The system is now armed to detect the next first-crossing event.\n\nThis sequential processing of intervals ensures that the logic of renewal is strictly enforced. An upward crossing of $\\lambda_0$ is only counted if the system is in the $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{eligible}}$ state, and upon counting, the state switches to $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{ineligible}}$, where it remains until a definitive return to the basin $\\mathcal{A}$ is observed.\n\n**Finalization**:\n- After the loop over all time intervals completes, the estimated forward flux is computed using the total number of counted events and the total simulation time:\n$$ \\widehat{\\Phi}_{\\mathcal{A},0} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{fc}}}{T} $$\nIf $T=0$ (e.g., for a trajectory with fewer than $2$ points), the flux is defined as $0$. The final flux and all crossing times are rounded to the specified precision of $10^{-6}$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run all test cases and print the final output.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def compute_crossings(times, lambdas, lambda_A, lambda_0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the forward flux, number of crossings, and crossing times.\n\n        Args:\n            times (np.ndarray): Array of time points.\n            lambdas (np.ndarray): Array of reaction coordinate values.\n            lambda_A (float): Threshold for basin A.\n            lambda_0 (float): Threshold for the first interface.\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple: A tuple containing (flux, num_crossings, crossing_times_list).\n        \"\"\"\n        if len(times)  2:\n            return 0.0, 0, []\n\n        total_time = times[-1] - times[0]\n        num_crossings = 0\n        crossing_times = []\n        \n        # State machine: True if eligible to cross, False if must return to A first.\n        # Start in the eligible state, assuming the simulation originates from A.\n        is_eligible = True\n\n        for i in range(len(times) - 1):\n            t_i, lambda_i = times[i], lambdas[i]\n            t_i_plus_1, lambda_i_plus_1 = times[i+1], lambdas[i+1]\n\n            # 1.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical data ($N$, $T$, $\\{K_i\\}$, $\\{m_i\\}$) to compute the rate constant according to the FFS algorithm. The language is objective and precise. The data are self-consistent and physically plausible; for instance, the conditional probabilities of advancing toward the product state generally decrease as the system approaches the transition state region, which is expected. The potential function parameters ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$) serve to define the physical context but are not directly needed for the calculation from the simulation statistics, which is a common scenario in analyzing simulation output. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe transition rate constant $k_{AB}$ for the process $A \\to B$ can be calculated using the Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) formula. The rate is the product of the flux of trajectories out of the initial state $A$ across the first interface $\\lambda_{0}$, and the probability that a trajectory crossing $\\lambda_{0}$ will eventually reach the final state $B$ without returning to $A$.\n\n$k_{AB} = \\Phi_{0} \\times P(B|\\lambda_{0})$\n\nThe first term, $\\Phi_{0}$, is the rate at which trajectories originating in basin $A$ cross the interface $\\lambda_{0}$ for the first time in the forward direction. Based on the long steady-state simulation conducted in basin $A$, this flux is estimated as the total number of upcrossings of $\\lambda_0$, $N$, divided by the total simulation time, $T$.\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{0} = \\frac{N}{T}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Phi_{0} = \\frac{12000}{100\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 120\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe second term, $P(B|\\lambda_{0})$, is the conditional probability that a trajectory having reached $\\lambda_{0}$ will proceed to state $B$. In FFS, this probability is calculated as a product of conditional probabilities of crossing from one interface $\\lambda_{i}$ to the next $\\lambda_{i+1}$:\n\n$$\nP(B|\\lambda_{0}) = P(\\lambda_{1}|\\lambda_{0}) \\times P(\\lambda_{2}|\\lambda_{1}) \\times P(\\lambda_{3}|\\lambda_{2}) \\times P(\\lambda_{4}|\\lambda_{3}) \\times P(B|\\lambda_{4})\n$$\n\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$\nP(B|\\lambda_{0}) = \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{3} P(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_{i}) \\right) \\times P(B|\\lambda_{4})\n$$\n\nEach conditional probability $P(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_{i})$ is estimated from the FFS trial runs as the ratio of the number of successful trials, $m_{i}$ (trajectories that reach $\\lambda_{i+1}$ before returning to $A$), to the total number of trials launched from $\\lambda_{i}$, $K_{i}$.\n\n$$\nP(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_{i}) \\approx \\frac{m_{i}}{K_{i}}\n$$\n\nThe final probability, $P(B|\\lambda_{4})$, is estimated similarly as $m_{4}/K_{4}$.\n\nLet's calculate each probability:\n$P(\\lambda_{1}|\\lambda_{0}) = \\frac{m_{0}}{K_{0}} = \\frac{400}{5000} = 0.08$\n$P(\\lambda_{2}|\\lambda_{1}) = \\frac{m_{1}}{K_{1}} = \\frac{480}{4000} = 0.12$\n$P(\\lambda_{3}|\\lambda_{2}) = \\frac{m_{2}}{K_{2}} = \\frac{200}{2000} = 0.10$\n$P(\\lambda_{4}|\\lambda_{3}) = \\frac{m_{3}}{K_{3}} = \\frac{70}{1000} = 0.07$\n$P(B|\\lambda_{4}) = \\frac{m_{4}}{K_{4}} = \\frac{60}{1000} = 0.06$\n\nNow, we compute the total conditional probability $P(B|\\lambda_{0})$:\n$$\nP(B|\\lambda_{0}) = 0.08 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.10 \\times 0.07 \\times 0.06\n$$\n$$\nP(B|\\lambda_{0}) = (8 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-1}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-1}) \\times (7 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (6 \\times 10^{-2})\n$$\n$$\nP(B|\\lambda_{0}) = (8 \\times 1.2 \\times 1 \\times 7 \\times 6) \\times 10^{-2-1-1-2-2} = 403.2 \\times 10^{-8} = 4.032 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\n\nWith $\\Phi_{0}$ and $P(B|\\lambda_{0})$, we can calculate the single-site transition rate constant $k_{AB}$:\n$$\nk_{AB} = \\Phi_{0} \\times P(B|\\lambda_{0}) = (120\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (4.032 \\times 10^{-6})\n$$\n$$\nk_{AB} = 483.84 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 4.8384 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$k_{AB} \\approx 4.838 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we determine the macroscopic transition rate per unit volume, $J$.

The number of successes, $s_i$, follows a binomial distribution, $s_i \\sim \\mathrm{Bin}(n_i, P_i)$.\n\nThe point estimator for the unknown probability $P_i$ is the sample proportion, denoted $\\hat{P}_i$:\n$$\n\\hat{P}_{i} = \\frac{s_{i}}{n_{i}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $s_i = 210$ and $n_i = 1000$:\n$$\n\\hat{P}_{i} = \\frac{210}{1000} = 0.21\n$$\n\nThe variance of this estimator is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{P}_i) = \\frac{P_i(1-P_i)}{n_i}$. The standard error, $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{P}_i)$, is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{P}_i$.

We can separate the term $P_i$ from the product:\n$$\nk_{AB} = \\left(\\phi_{0} \\prod_{j\\neq i}P_{j}\\right) P_{i}\n$$\nLet's define a constant $C = \\phi_{0} \\prod_{j\\neq i}P_{j}$. The problem states that the uncertainty in this combined term is negligible. We can calculate its value:\n$$\nC = (5.0 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = 15.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.15 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nSo, the relationship is $k_{AB} = C P_i$.\n\nThe point estimate for $k_{AB}$ is obtained by using the point estimate for $P_i$:\n$$\n\\hat{k}_{AB} = C \\hat{P}_{i} = 0.15 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\times 0.21 = 0.0315 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe uncertainty in $\\hat{k}_{AB}$ is found using first-order uncertainty propagation. For a function $f(x)$, the variance is approximately $(\\frac{df}{dx})^2 \\mathrm{Var}(x)$.
