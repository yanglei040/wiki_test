## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles and mechanisms governing the existence and stability of Weyl and Dirac semimetals, focusing on their unique band structures characterized by protected, point-like degeneracies. These seemingly abstract topological features are not mere theoretical curiosities; they are the wellspring of a vast and growing landscape of observable physical phenomena. This chapter bridges the gap from principle to practice, exploring how the core concepts of chiral fermions, Berry curvature, and the bulk-boundary correspondence manifest in measurable transport properties, are revealed by advanced spectroscopic techniques, and can be manipulated by external stimuli. We will demonstrate that these materials serve not only as platforms for novel electronic applications but also as [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) laboratories for testing concepts from high-energy physics, [many-body theory](@entry_id:169452), and even [quantum information science](@entry_id:150091).

### Connections to Fundamental Physics

Perhaps the most profound aspect of Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) is their status as a condensed matter realization of concepts originally conceived in the realm of quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241) (QFT) and particle physics. They provide a tangible, low-energy setting in which to observe the physics of chiral fermions, which are central to the Standard Model.

A cornerstone of this connection is the **[chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077)**. In QFT, the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) refers to the quantum mechanical breakdown of the classical conservation law for axial current. In a Weyl semimetal, this manifests as the non-conservation of the number of particles near nodes of a given [chirality](@entry_id:144105) in the presence of parallel electric ($ \mathbf{E} $) and magnetic ($ \mathbf{B} $) fields. One can visualize this as a "pumping" of fermions between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. A rigorous theoretical treatment of this phenomenon, especially within a lattice model, requires careful regularization to remove non-physical "doubler" states that arise from naive [discretization](@entry_id:145012). The inclusion of a Wilson term in a lattice Dirac operator, for example, correctly breaks chiral symmetry for the doublers at the Brillouin zone edge, giving them a large mass and [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) them, while preserving the physical anomaly of the low-energy Weyl fermions near the center. This procedure ultimately yields the celebrated anomaly equation, $\partial_{\mu} j_{5}^{\mu} \propto \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$, where $j_{5}^{\mu}$ is the axial [four-current](@entry_id:199021) [@problem_id:3503547].

This microscopic anomaly has a direct macroscopic consequence in the form of a topological term in the effective electromagnetic action of the material, known as the [axion](@entry_id:156508) term, $\mathcal{L}_{\theta} \propto \theta \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$. This term modifies Maxwell's equations within the medium. One of the most striking predictions of this "[axion electrodynamics](@entry_id:144423)" is the Witten effect. A direct consequence of the modified Gauss's law is that a [magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129), if placed inside such a material, would induce a real electric charge density in its vicinity. The total induced charge is directly proportional to the monopole's magnetic charge and the material's effective [axion angle](@entry_id:139420) $\theta$ [@problem_id:1239167]. While magnetic monopoles remain hypothetical, this effect highlights the deep connection between the topological [band structure](@entry_id:139379) of the solid and the fundamental laws of electromagnetism.

### Electronic Transport and Spectroscopic Signatures

The most accessible and technologically relevant consequences of the Weyl and Dirac [band structure](@entry_id:139379) are found in the materials' unique responses to electric and magnetic fields. These transport and spectroscopic signatures are not only key diagnostic tools but also point toward potential device applications.

#### Anomalous Transport Phenomena

The non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) of the electronic wavefunctions, quantified by the Berry curvature, gives rise to several [anomalous transport](@entry_id:746472) effects. The Berry curvature acts as a fictitious magnetic field in momentum space, deflecting electron wavepackets and leading to Hall-like currents even in the absence of an external magnetic field.

The quintessential example is the **intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE)**. In a time-reversal-breaking Weyl semimetal, the anomalous Hall conductivity is directly proportional to the momentum-space [separation vector](@entry_id:268468) between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. This provides a direct transport measurement of a key topological parameter of the [band structure](@entry_id:139379). The 3D AHE can be elegantly conceptualized by considering the Brillouin zone sliced into 2D planes perpendicular to the node separation axis. The planes situated between the two nodes behave as 2D quantum Hall insulators, each with a quantized Hall conductance characterized by a non-zero Chern number. The total 3D anomalous Hall conductivity emerges as an integral of these 2D slice Chern numbers over the Brillouin zone, vanishing for planes outside the nodal region [@problem_id:3503544]. More realistic models of materials often feature multiple pairs of Weyl nodes, and the net AHE is the vector sum of the separations of all pairs, often modulated by factors that account for the Fermi level position relative to each node [@problemid:3503533].

A second key signature is the **[negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729)** (or positive magnetoconductivity) arising from the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) discussed previously. When electric and magnetic fields are applied parallel to each other, the charge pumping between nodes creates a highly efficient, low-scattering conduction channel along the field direction. This anomalous contribution adds to the conventional Drude conductivity, causing the material's resistance to decrease with the applied magnetic field, in stark contrast to the positive [magnetoresistance](@entry_id:265774) observed in ordinary metals. The magnitude of this effect can be calculated within a semiclassical Boltzmann framework, where the anomalous conductivity is typically proportional to $B^2$ and depends on the [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) time that limits the buildup of chiral charge [@problem_id:3503fassic3].

Beyond [linear response](@entry_id:146180), tilted Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) that break inversion symmetry can exhibit a **nonlinear Hall effect**. This is a second-order response where a transverse Hall-like voltage develops that is quadratic in the applied electric field. The microscopic origin of this effect is the **Berry curvature dipole (BCD)**, which represents the first moment of the Berry curvature over the occupied states of the Fermi sea. In a system with [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094), a non-zero BCD, and thus a nonlinear Hall effect, is only possible if [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) is broken, for which the presence of a cone tilt is a [sufficient condition](@entry_id:276242). The careful calculation and symmetry analysis of the BCD tensor is a critical step in predicting the magnitude and direction of the nonlinear current [@problem_id:3503555].

#### Quantum Oscillations and Berry Phase

Quantum oscillations, such as the de Haas-van Alphen (magnetization) and Shubnikov-de Haas ([resistivity](@entry_id:266481)) effects, are powerful experimental tools for mapping the Fermi surface of a metal. In [topological semimetals](@entry_id:137800), they provide a crucial window into the [geometric phase](@entry_id:138449) of the electronic wavefunctions. According to the Onsager-Lifshitz-Kosevich theory, the phase of these oscillations is governed by the Berry phase $\Phi_B$ accumulated by an electron traversing a cyclotron orbit.

For conventional electrons with a parabolic dispersion (Schrödinger fermions), $\Phi_B=0$. For chiral Dirac or Weyl fermions, however, the orbit encloses a topological singularity, and the electron acquires a non-trivial Berry phase of $\Phi_B = \pi$. This distinction has a direct experimental consequence. When plotting the integer indices of oscillation extrema against the inverse magnetic field (a "Landau fan diagram"), the intercept of the resulting line is directly related to the Berry phase. An ideal 2D Dirac system exhibits a zero-phase intercept, in sharp contrast to the $-1/2$ intercept expected for Schrödinger fermions. Observing this zero-phase intercept is thus considered strong evidence for the existence of Dirac-like quasiparticles. However, experimental analysis must carefully account for complicating factors, such as Zeeman splitting, which can cause apparent [phase shifts](@entry_id:136717) near "spin-zero" conditions, and oscillations of the chemical potential in samples with fixed [carrier density](@entry_id:199230) [@problem_id:2812578].

#### Surface States and Novel Geometries

The bulk-boundary correspondence guarantees that the non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) of the bulk band structure manifests as protected states on the material's surface. For Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), these take the form of **Fermi arcs**. These are open-ended segments of a Fermi surface that connect the projections of bulk Weyl nodes of opposite chirality onto the surface Brillouin zone. The existence and connectivity of these arcs are the primary observable signature of a Weyl semimetal. Advanced computational techniques, based on the calculation of the surface Green's function, allow for the direct simulation of the surface spectral function, providing a theoretical map of the Fermi arcs and predicting how their shape and length evolve as the chemical potential is tuned [@problem_id:3503556].

The interplay between these unique surface states and the chiral bulk states can lead to entirely new quantum phenomena in finite-sized samples. A remarkable example occurs in a thin slab of a Weyl semimetal subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. An electron can execute a novel type of [cyclotron motion](@entry_id:276597), known as a **"Weyl orbit,"** by traversing a Fermi arc on the top surface, tunneling through the bulk via a chiral zeroth Landau level, traversing the Fermi arc on the bottom surface in the opposite direction, and tunneling back to the top. This "stitched" orbit couples the two surfaces, and its period depends on both the Fermi arc length and the slab thickness. Consequently, this phenomenon gives rise to [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355) whose frequency is thickness-dependent, a unique and unambiguous signature of this hybrid surface-bulk orbit [@problem_id:3503569].

#### Spectroscopic Probes

While transport measurements provide macroscopic evidence, spectroscopic techniques can visualize the electronic structure in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). **Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)**, in particular, has become an indispensable tool. By measuring the [local density of states](@entry_id:136852), STM can detect the [standing wave](@entry_id:261209) patterns formed by electrons scattering off impurities. The Fourier transform of these [real-space](@entry_id:754128) interference patterns, known as **Quasi-Particle Interference (QPI)**, reveals the dominant scattering wavevectors $\mathbf{q}$ that connect points of high [density of states](@entry_id:147894) on the constant-energy contours. For a Weyl semimetal, the endpoints of the Fermi arcs have a high density of states, and thus the most intense QPI signal corresponds to the [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) connecting these two points. QPI analysis therefore provides a direct, momentum-resolved measurement of Fermi arc connectivity, serving as a powerful method to experimentally confirm their existence and shape [@problem_id:3503604].

### Material Engineering and External Control

A significant advantage of condensed matter systems is the ability to tune their properties with external knobs. For [topological semimetals](@entry_id:137800), this opens the door to engineering the number, position, and properties of the Weyl and Dirac nodes themselves.

Mechanical strain is a particularly clean and effective tuning parameter. Applying strain modifies the crystal lattice, which in turn alters the electronic Hamiltonian through deformation potentials. Since Weyl nodes are protected by symmetry, strain that breaks a protecting symmetry can have dramatic effects. For instance, in a Dirac semimetal protected by both time-reversal and [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948), applying a strain that breaks inversion can lift the degeneracy of the Dirac point, splitting it into a pair of Weyl nodes [@problem_id:3503520]. Even more exotic is the concept of a **pseudo-magnetic field**. A carefully designed non-uniform strain texture can create an effective axial [vector potential](@entry_id:153642) $\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$ that couples to the chiral fermions. The curl of this potential, $\mathbf{B}_5 = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}_5$, acts as a real magnetic field for the Weyl electrons, leading to the formation of quantized pseudo-Landau levels, even in the complete absence of an external magnetic field [@problem_id:2870327].

Another powerful tuning method is chemical substitution or alloying. By systematically replacing atoms in the crystal lattice (e.g., substituting phosphorus for arsenic in $\text{TaAs}$), one can continuously tune the parameters of the effective Hamiltonian, such as hopping amplitudes and on-site energies. In a simplified theoretical framework like the **Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA)**, these parameters are modeled as a [linear interpolation](@entry_id:137092) between the end-member compounds. This approach allows for the computational mapping of a material's [topological phase](@entry_id:146448) diagram, revealing the range of chemical compositions over which the Weyl phase is stable and identifying critical concentrations where nodes may be created or annihilated [@problem_id:3503528].

### Connections to Broader Fields of Physics

The study of Weyl and Dirac semimetals is inherently interdisciplinary, with deep connections extending to other major branches of physics.

#### Many-Body Physics and Screening

While much of the introductory theory treats electrons as non-interacting, understanding their collective behavior is crucial. A fundamental question in many-body physics is how a gas of mobile electrons screens an external charge impurity. The response is described by the material's [dielectric function](@entry_id:136859), $\epsilon(\mathbf{q}, \omega)$, which can be calculated in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) from the bare polarization or **Lindhard function**, $\Pi_0(\mathbf{q}, \omega)$. The unique linear dispersion $E \propto k$ of Dirac and Weyl fermions, as opposed to the quadratic dispersion of conventional electrons, leads to a qualitatively different Lindhard function. This results in distinct screening properties, including a different [power-law decay](@entry_id:262227) of the [screened potential](@entry_id:193863), which impacts a wide range of interaction-driven phenomena in these materials [@problem_id:1166085].

#### Quantum Information Science

The concept of [quantum entanglement](@entry_id:136576), central to quantum information, has provided a new and powerful lens through which to understand [topological phases of matter](@entry_id:144114). The **entanglement-[boundary correspondence](@entry_id:167571)** posits that for many topological systems, the spectrum of the "entanglement Hamiltonian" of a spatial subregion mimics the physical energy spectrum of the system's boundary. When this principle is applied to a Dirac semimetal, one finds a remarkable result: a real-space bipartition of the system's ground state wavefunction yields an [entanglement spectrum](@entry_id:138110) that is gapless. The locus of these gapless entanglement modes forms an **"entanglement Fermi arc"** in the surface Brillouin zone, which directly corresponds to the physical Fermi arc of the [surface states](@entry_id:137922). This establishes a profound link between the quantum [information content](@entry_id:272315) of the bulk ground state and the observable topological boundary phenomena [@problem_id:1239148].

In summary, Weyl and Dirac semimetals represent a vibrant and rapidly evolving field that lies at the intersection of condensed matter, high-energy physics, materials science, and quantum information. Their rich phenomenology, from [anomalous transport](@entry_id:746472) to novel spectroscopic signatures, not only confirms deep theoretical principles but also provides a fertile ground for the discovery of new physical effects and the design of next-generation [quantum materials](@entry_id:136741).
