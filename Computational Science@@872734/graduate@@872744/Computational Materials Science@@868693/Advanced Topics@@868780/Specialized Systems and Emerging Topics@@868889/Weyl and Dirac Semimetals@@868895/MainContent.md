## Introduction
Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) represent a fascinating class of quantum materials where the electronic band structure gives rise to quasiparticles that mimic relativistic fermions from high-energy physics. Their discovery has opened a new frontier in condensed matter, promising a wealth of exotic physical phenomena rooted in the profound principles of topology. However, understanding the origin of their unique properties—from protected band crossings to anomalous electronic transport—requires a firm grasp of the interplay between symmetry, topology, and quantum mechanics. This article serves as a comprehensive guide, bridging fundamental theory with observable phenomena and practical computational methods.

The journey begins in the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter, where we will dissect the theoretical foundations of these materials. We will explore the effective Hamiltonians that describe Weyl and Dirac nodes, uncover their topological nature as monopoles of Berry curvature in momentum space, and establish the crucial role of crystal symmetries in their existence and stability. Following this, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will connect this abstract theory to the real world. We will investigate the measurable signatures of topology, including the celebrated Fermi arc surface states and [anomalous transport](@entry_id:746472) effects like the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077), and explore deep connections to fields like quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241) and quantum information. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section offers a gateway to applying these concepts, outlining computational exercises for simulating topological phase transitions and calculating key [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526), equipping you with the practical skills to explore these remarkable materials.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The defining characteristic of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) is the existence of points in their Brillouin zone where conduction and valence bands touch. These touching points, or nodes, are not accidental but are protected by the underlying crystal symmetries and topology of the electronic wavefunctions. Unlike in conventional metals where a continuous Fermi surface separates occupied and unoccupied states, in these materials, the Fermi level lies precisely at the [nodal points](@entry_id:171339), leading to a point-like or line-like Fermi surface. The low-energy excitations near these nodes behave as relativistic [massless particles](@entry_id:263424), giving rise to a host of exotic physical phenomena. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles governing the existence of these nodes, the role of symmetry in differentiating them, and the mechanisms that lead to their unique observable signatures.

### The Weyl Node: A Monopole in Momentum Space

The simplest description of a [band crossing](@entry_id:161733) can be formulated using a two-band model. In the vicinity of a potential degeneracy, a generic two-band Bloch Hamiltonian $H(\mathbf{k})$ can be expressed in the basis of the two bands as a $2 \times 2$ matrix. Any such matrix can be expanded using the identity matrix $\mathbb{I}$ and the three Pauli matrices $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$:

$H(\mathbf{k}) = d_0(\mathbf{k})\mathbb{I} + \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$

Here, $d_0(\mathbf{k})$ represents an average energy shift, while the vector function $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) = (d_x(\mathbf{k}), d_y(\mathbf{k}), d_z(\mathbf{k}))$ governs the splitting of the bands. The [energy eigenvalues](@entry_id:144381) are $E_{\pm}(\mathbf{k}) = d_0(\mathbf{k}) \pm |\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})|$. A band degeneracy occurs at any momentum point $\mathbf{k}$ where the two bands touch, which requires $|\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})|=0$. This is equivalent to simultaneously satisfying three independent equations:

$d_x(\mathbf{k}) = 0$
$d_y(\mathbf{k}) = 0$
$d_z(\mathbf{k}) = 0$

In a three-dimensional [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) with coordinates $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$, finding a solution to three independent equations generically yields a set of isolated points. In the language of topology, the **codimension** of the degeneracy—the number of constraints that must be satisfied—is 3. The dimension of the resulting manifold of degenerate points is the dimension of the space minus the codimension, which is $3 - 3 = 0$. This implies that, without any additional symmetry, band crossings in three-dimensional materials are expected to be point-like nodes [@problem_id:3007282].

Near such a nodal point, which we may place at $\mathbf{k}_0$, the vector function $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})$ can be linearized. Letting $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}_0$, we have $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{q}) \approx \mathbf{v}\mathbf{q}$, where $\mathbf{v}$ is a $3 \times 3$ real matrix known as the velocity tensor. Neglecting the overall energy shift $d_0$, the effective Hamiltonian near the node takes the form:

$H(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_{i,j} v_{ij} q_i \sigma_j$

This is the general form of a **Weyl Hamiltonian**. In the simplest isotropic case, where $\mathbf{v}$ is proportional to the identity matrix, the Hamiltonian simplifies to $H(\mathbf{q}) = v \chi \mathbf{q} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$, where $v$ is a velocity and $\chi = \pm 1$ is a sign factor [@problem_id:3503548].

The profound nature of this node lies in its topological character. The electronic wavefunctions $|u_n(\mathbf{k})\rangle$ that diagonalize the Hamiltonian possess a geometric property encoded in the **Berry curvature**, defined as $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k}) = \nabla_{\mathbf{k}} \times \mathbf{A}_n(\mathbf{k})$, where $\mathbf{A}_n(\mathbf{k}) = i\langle u_n(\mathbf{k}) | \nabla_{\mathbf{k}} u_n(\mathbf{k}) \rangle$ is the Berry connection. For the lower energy band ($E_{-}=-v|\mathbf{q}|$) of the simple Weyl Hamiltonian, a direct calculation yields the Berry curvature [@problem_id:3503548]:

$\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{-}(\mathbf{q}) = \chi \frac{\mathbf{q}}{2 |\mathbf{q}|^3}$

This mathematical form is identical to the magnetic field of a magnetic monopole located at the origin of [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). The Weyl node is thus a source or sink of Berry curvature. The strength of this monopole is a quantized topological invariant, known as the **[chirality](@entry_id:144105)** or **monopole charge** $C$. It is obtained by integrating the Berry flux over a closed surface $S$ (e.g., a small sphere) enclosing the node:

$C = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_S \boldsymbol{\Omega}_{-}(\mathbf{q}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}$

Performing this integration gives $C = \chi$. This integer charge $(\pm 1)$ robustly protects the Weyl node: it cannot be removed by small, continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian. The node can only be annihilated by merging with another Weyl node of opposite chirality. The chirality is ultimately determined by the effective velocity tensor of the linearized Hamiltonian, with $\chi = \text{sgn}(\det(\mathbf{v}))$ [@problem_id:3503633].

### Symmetry Foundations of Weyl and Dirac Semimetals

The existence and type of [nodal points](@entry_id:171339) are strictly governed by the fundamental symmetries of the crystal lattice, primarily **time-reversal symmetry** ($\mathcal{T}$) and **[inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948)** ($\mathcal{P}$).

For spinful electrons, the time-reversal operator is antiunitary and squares to $\mathcal{T}^2 = -1$, while the inversion operator is unitary and squares to $\mathcal{P}^2 = +1$. Their actions on the [band structure](@entry_id:139379) $E_n(\mathbf{k})$ and Berry curvature $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k})$ are:

- $\mathcal{T}$: $E_n(\mathbf{k}) = E_{n'}(-\mathbf{k})$, $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k}) = -\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{n'}(-\mathbf{k})$
- $\mathcal{P}$: $E_n(\mathbf{k}) = E_{n'}(-\mathbf{k})$, $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k}) = \boldsymbol{\Omega}_{n'}(-\mathbf{k})$

If a crystal possesses both inversion and time-reversal symmetry, the constraints on the Berry curvature combine to give $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k}) = -\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k})$, which forces $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k}) = \mathbf{0}$ everywhere in the Brillouin zone. Since a Weyl node is defined by a non-zero local Berry curvature flux, it cannot exist in a material that preserves both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries [@problem_id:3503557] [@problem_id:1827867].

Furthermore, in a system with both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$, the combined operator $\mathcal{PT}$ is an antiunitary symmetry that commutes with the Hamiltonian at each $\mathbf{k}$. Crucially, for spinful systems, $(\mathcal{PT})^2 = \mathcal{P}^2\mathcal{T}^2 = (1)(-1) = -1$. By a generalization of Kramers' theorem, an antiunitary symmetry that squares to $-1$ enforces at least a two-fold degeneracy for every band at *every* point $\mathbf{k}$ in the Brillouin zone.

This leads to a fundamental dichotomy:

1.  **Weyl Semimetals**: To host Weyl nodes, a crystal must break either inversion symmetry $\mathcal{P}$ (e.g., in [non-centrosymmetric materials](@entry_id:181206) like the TaAs family) or [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) $\mathcal{T}$ (e.g., in magnetic materials).
    - If $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved but $\mathcal{P}$ is broken, the symmetry constraint $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k}) = -\boldsymbol{\Omega}(-\mathbf{k})$ implies that a Weyl node at $\mathbf{k}$ with chirality $C$ must be accompanied by a time-reversed partner at $-\mathbf{k}$ with the same [chirality](@entry_id:144105) $C$. The **Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem**, which states that the net [chirality](@entry_id:144105) over the entire periodic Brillouin zone must be zero, then dictates that there must be at least one more such pair with the opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105). Therefore, the minimum number of Weyl nodes in a time-reversal-symmetric system is four [@problem_id:3503526].
    - If $\mathcal{P}$ is preserved but $\mathcal{T}$ is broken, the constraint $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k}) = \boldsymbol{\Omega}(-\mathbf{k})$ is not very restrictive. Instead, the combination of $\mathcal{P}$ with magnetism implies that a node at $\mathbf{k}$ with chirality $C$ must be paired with one at $-\mathbf{k}$ with the opposite chirality $-C$. A minimal system can therefore exist with just two Weyl nodes [@problem_id:3503647].

2.  **Dirac Semimetals**: In crystals that possess both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, the universal two-fold degeneracy means all bands form Kramers pairs at every $\mathbf{k}$. While individual Weyl nodes are forbidden, it is possible for two of these degenerate bands to cross each other. If this crossing is protected by an additional crystalline symmetry, a stable four-fold degenerate point node is formed. This is a **Dirac point**. It can be conceptualized as two Weyl nodes of opposite chirality residing at the same point in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), resulting in a net zero [chirality](@entry_id:144105), consistent with the constraints of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry [@problem_id:3503557] [@problem_id:1827867].

A clear illustration of this relationship is the transition from a Dirac to a Weyl semimetal upon breaking one of the protecting symmetries. Consider a minimal four-band [tight-binding model](@entry_id:143446), known as the Wilson-Dirac Hamiltonian, which can describe a Dirac semimetal [@problem_id:3503560]. At a critical parameter value (e.g., mass $m=0$), this model hosts a single Dirac point at the BZ center. If [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) is then broken by adding a Zeeman term $H_Z = b I \otimes \sigma_z$, the four-fold degeneracy is lifted. The Dirac point splits into a pair of two-fold degenerate Weyl points that move away from each other in momentum space. For a magnetic field along the $z$-direction, these Weyl nodes separate along the $k_z$ axis, their positions satisfying the relation $\cos k_z = 1 - \frac{b^2}{2t't}$, where $b$ is the Zeeman energy and $t, t'$ are hopping parameters. This demonstrates explicitly that the Dirac point is a parent state from which Weyl points emerge when either $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is broken.

### The Role of Crystalline Symmetries and Group Theory

The stability of band crossings is formally understood through the representation theory of the crystal's space group. The key concept is the **little group** $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbf{k}}$, which is the subgroup of [space group](@entry_id:140010) operations that leave a momentum vector $\mathbf{k}$ invariant. According to the von Neumann-Wigner theorem, bands that transform according to the same irreducible representation (irrep) of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbf{k}}$ will hybridize and repel each other, opening a gap. A stable crossing is only possible between bands that belong to *distinct* irreps of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbf{k}}$.

This principle provides a rigorous foundation for the existence of Weyl and Dirac nodes [@problem_id:3503557] [@problem_id:3503526]:
- A **Weyl node**, being a two-fold crossing of otherwise non-degenerate bands, is minimally realized as a symmetry-protected crossing of two bands that transform according to distinct one-dimensional irreps of the little group $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbf{k}}$.
- A **Dirac node**, being a four-fold crossing of two Kramers-degenerate bands in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system, is protected if the two Kramers doublets transform as distinct two-dimensional irreps of $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbf{k}}$. Such distinct high-dimensional irreps are often found along high-symmetry lines or at high-symmetry points. For example, along an axis with $C_4$ [rotational symmetry](@entry_id:137077), [electronic states](@entry_id:171776) can be classified by their $C_4$ eigenvalues. Two Kramers pairs with different sets of $C_4$ eigenvalues cannot hybridize, protecting their crossing and forming a Dirac point. Breaking the $C_4$ symmetry would allow hybridization and gap out the node.

Crystal symmetries also impose strict constraints on the form of the effective Weyl Hamiltonian $H(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_{i,j} v_{ij} q_i \sigma_j$. For instance, a $C_{2z}$ rotation symmetry can dictate that certain elements of the velocity tensor $v_{ij}$ must be zero, leading to a block-[diagonal form](@entry_id:264850). The chirality of the resulting node is then robustly given by $\chi = \text{sgn}(\det(\mathbf{v}))$ [@problem_id:3503633]. In some cases, **[nonsymmorphic space groups](@entry_id:181541)** (containing screw axes or [glide planes](@entry_id:182991)) can enforce degeneracies of dimension four or even eight at the Brillouin zone boundaries, creating Dirac-like nodes purely as a consequence of space [group algebra](@entry_id:145139), without reliance on $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry [@problem_id:3503526].

While point nodes are of codimension 3, degeneracies can also form one-dimensional manifolds, or **[nodal lines](@entry_id:169397)**, which have codimension 2. This requires an additional symmetry to constrain one of the $d_i(\mathbf{k})$ functions to be zero over a plane or line in the BZ. A common mechanism is a mirror symmetry. Within the mirror-invariant plane in the BZ, the Hamiltonian can be block-diagonalized according to mirror eigenvalues. Bands with opposite mirror eigenvalues cannot hybridize, and their crossing is governed by a single equation, thus forming a line of degeneracy [@problem_id:3007282].

### Observable Signatures and Advanced Topics

The non-trivial momentum-space topology of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) gives rise to unique, experimentally observable phenomena.

#### Bulk-Boundary Correspondence and Fermi Arcs

The most celebrated signature of a Weyl semimetal is the existence of unconventional surface states, governed by the principle of **[bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647)**. The topological charge of the bulk Weyl nodes necessitates the appearance of protected states on the [crystal surface](@entry_id:195760). These states manifest as open **Fermi arcs** in the surface Brillouin zone (SBZ). Unlike conventional surface states that form closed loops, a Fermi arc is a contour of zero-energy states that connects the surface projections of two bulk Weyl nodes with opposite net [chirality](@entry_id:144105) [@problem_id:3503542].

To predict the Fermi arcs for a given surface, one must project the positions of all bulk Weyl nodes onto the 2D SBZ corresponding to that surface. The net projected [chirality](@entry_id:144105) at a point in the SBZ is the sum of the chiralities of all bulk nodes that project to it. A Fermi arc is topologically required to emerge from a projection with positive net charge and terminate on a projection with negative net charge.

The number and connectivity of these arcs depend critically on the surface termination. For example, consider a system with four Weyl nodes at $(\pm k_0, 0, \pm k_1)$. On a surface normal to the $z$-axis (the (001) surface), nodes with opposite chirality $(\pm k_1)$ project to the same points $(\pm k_0, 0)$. The net projected chirality is zero, and no Fermi arcs are topologically required. However, on a surface normal to the $y$-axis (the (010) surface), all four nodes project to distinct points in the SBZ, each carrying a non-zero projected charge. In this case, Fermi arcs must exist to connect the projected nodes. While the existence of the arcs and their endpoints are topologically guaranteed, their precise shape and connectivity (i.e., which positive projection connects to which negative one) are non-universal and can be altered by modifying the surface, for instance, by changing its chemical termination [@problem_id:3503542].

#### Magnetotransport and Superlattice Effects

The unique band structure of Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) profoundly affects their response to external magnetic fields. The most discussed phenomenon is the **[chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077)**, where the application of parallel electric and magnetic fields pumps electrons between Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105), leading to a [negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729) (LMR). However, the real behavior in materials is often more complex. A more complete semiclassical Boltzmann transport model, accounting for multiple anisotropic electron and [hole pockets](@entry_id:269009), reveals that factors like [carrier density](@entry_id:199230) compensation ($n_e \approx n_h$) can dominate the transport signature, sometimes leading to a large positive LMR, as observed in type-II Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) like $\text{WTe}_2$ [@problem_id:3503599].

Finally, the topological robustness of Weyl nodes can be probed by intentionally breaking the crystal's translational symmetry, for example, by creating a superlattice. Forming an $N$-fold supercell along one direction causes the Brillouin zone to fold, mapping multiple points from the original BZ into a single point in the new, smaller reduced Brillouin zone (rBZ). This reorganizes the apparent locations of the Weyl nodes. The Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem remains valid in the rBZ, but the folding can lead to a remarkable outcome: **node annihilation**. If the geometric arrangement of nodes in the original BZ is such that two nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105), separated by a momentum $\Delta \mathbf{k}$, are folded onto the same point in the rBZ, a gap can be opened. This occurs when $\Delta \mathbf{k}$ is an integer multiple of a new [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906) of the supercell. This mechanism provides a pathway to tune a [topological semimetal](@entry_id:158907) into a trivial insulator by engineering its crystal structure [@problem_id:3503647].
