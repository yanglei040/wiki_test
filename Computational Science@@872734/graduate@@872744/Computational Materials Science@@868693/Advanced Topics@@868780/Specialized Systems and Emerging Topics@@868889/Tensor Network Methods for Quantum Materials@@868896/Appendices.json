Its action is defined by $\\mathbb{E} = \\sum_{s \\in \\{0,1\\}} A^s \\otimes \\overline{A^s}$. Since the given matrices $A^s$ are real, we have $\\overline{A^s} = A^s$.\n\nLet's compute the components of $\\mathbb{E}$:\n$$\nA^0 \\otimes A^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA^1 \\otimes A^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSumming these contributions, we obtain the transfer matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E} = A^0 \\otimes A^0 + A^1 \\otimes A^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe spectrum of $\\mathbb{E}$ consists of its eigenvalues, which are the diagonal entries of this matrix. The spectrum is $\\{\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\lambda_4\\} = \\{1, 1, 0, 0\\}$. The largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max} = 1$, is degenerate with a multiplicity of $2$.\n\nThe quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$ acts on the space of $D \\times D$ matrices. For any matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}$, its action is $\\mathcal{E}(X) = \\sum_s A^s X A^{s\\dagger}$. Since $A^s$ are real and symmetric, $A^{s\\dagger} = A^s$.\nLet $X = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{11}  x_{12} \\\\ x_{21}  x_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(X) = A^0 X A^0 + A^1 X A^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} X \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} X \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{11}  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  x_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{11}  0 \\\\ 0  x_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenmatrices (fixed points) corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$ are matrices $X$ such that $\\mathcal{E}(X) = X$. This condition gives $\\begin{pmatrix} x_{11}  0 \\\\ 0  x_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{11}  x_{12} \\\\ x_{21}  x_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$, which implies $x_{12}=0$ and $x_{21}=0$. The eigenspace is spanned by the matrices $E_{11} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $E_{22} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. These are the degenerate maximal-modulus fixed points.\n\nThis degeneracy has profound physical implications:\n1.  **Non-injectivity**: An MPS is injective if its transfer matrix has a unique fixed point of maximum modulus. The degeneracy found here means the MPS is non-injective. This implies that distinct states in the virtual space can be mapped to the same physical state upon tracing out part of the system.\n2.  **Long-Range Order (LRO)**: In the thermodynamic limit, the decay of correlations is governed by the ratio of the sub-dominant to dominant eigenvalues of the transfer matrix. The presence of degenerate dominant eigenvalues signals that correlations do not decay to zero over long distances, which is the definition of LRO.\n3.  **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB)**: The MPS tensors have a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, in that swapping $A^0 \\leftrightarrow A^1$ leaves the transfer matrix $\\mathbb{E}$ invariant. This corresponds to the physical spin-flip symmetry $\\prod_i \\sigma^x_i$. The two fixed points, $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$, correspond to two distinct symmetry-broken pure phases. In this case, $E_{11}$ generates the state $|00\\dots0\\rangle$ and $E_{22}$ generates $|11\\dots1\\rangle$. An infinitesimal symmetry-breaking field, such as $h\\sum_i \\sigma^z_i$, would select one of these states as the ground state, leading to a non-zero expectation value $\\langle\\sigma^z\\rangle \\neq 0$. The symmetric boundary conditions $v_L=v_R=(1,1)^T$ construct a symmetric superposition of these two phases, resulting in $\\langle\\sigma^z\\rangle = 0$, but the underlying tendency towards order is revealed in the two-point correlation function.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Expectation Values**\n\nWe work in the thermodynamic limit $N\\to\\infty$. Expectation values of local operators are computed using the transfer matrix and its fixed points. The unnormalized expectation value of an operator product $O_i O_j \\dots$ is $\\mathrm{Tr}(L \\mathcal{E}_{O_i} \\mathcal{E}^{j-i-1} \\mathcal{E}_{O_j} \\dots R)$, where $L$ and $R$ are the dominant left and right environmental fixed points and $\\mathcal{E}_O$ is the transfer matrix with operator $O$ inserted.\n\nThe left environment is $L = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\mathcal{E}^k(v_L v_L^T)$ and the right is $R = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\mathcal{E}^k(v_R v_R^T)$.\n$v_L v_L^T = v_R v_R^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = E_{11} + E_{12} + E_{21} + E_{22}$.\nApplying $\\mathcal{E}$ once gives:\n$\\mathcal{E}(E_{11}+E_{12}+E_{21}+E_{22}) = \\mathcal{E}(E_{11}) + \\mathcal{E}(E_{12}) + \\mathcal{E}(E_{21}) + \\mathcal{E}(E_{22}) = E_{11} + 0 + 0 + E_{22} = I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\nSince $I = E_{11} + E_{22}$ is a linear combination of the fixed points of $\\mathcal{E}$, it is itself a fixed point: $\\mathcal{E}(I)=I$.\nThus, for sites far from the boundary, the left and right environments are $L=R=I$.\n\nThe normalization factor is $\\mathcal{N}^2 = \\langle \\Psi | \\Psi \\rangle = \\mathrm{Tr}(L R) = \\mathrm{Tr}(I \\cdot I) = \\mathrm{Tr}(I) = 2$.\n\nThe one-point function $\\langle \\sigma^z_i \\rangle$ for a site $i$ in the bulk is given by $\\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(L \\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z}(R))}{\\mathrm{Tr}(LR)}$.\nThe operator transfer channel is $\\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z}(X) = \\sum_s \\langle s|\\sigma^z|s\\rangle A^s X A^{s\\dagger} = A^0 X A^0 - A^1 X A^1$.\nWe compute its action on the right environment $R=I$:\n$\\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z}(I) = A^0 I A^0 - A^1 I A^1 = (A^0)^2 - (A^1)^2 = E_{11} - E_{22}$. Let's denote this matrix by $X_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe numerator is $\\mathrm{Tr}(L X_z) = \\mathrm{Tr}(I \\cdot X_z) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}) = 1-1=0$.\nSo, the normalized one-point function is $\\langle \\sigma^z_i \\rangle = \\frac{0}{2} = 0$.\n\nThe two-point function $\\langle \\sigma^z_i \\sigma^z_{i+r} \\rangle$ for sites $i, i+r$ in the bulk ($r0$) is $\\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(L \\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z} \\mathcal{E}^{r-1} \\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z}(R))}{\\mathrm{Tr}(LR)}$.\n1.  Start with the right environment: $R=I$.\n2.  Apply the first operator insertion: $\\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z}(R) = \\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z}(I) = X_z$.\n3.  Propagate for $r-1$ sites: We need to compute $\\mathcal{E}^{r-1}(X_z)$. Let's check if $X_z$ is an eigenmatrix of $\\mathcal{E}$.\n    $\\mathcal{E}(X_z) = \\mathcal{E}(E_{11} - E_{22}) = \\mathcal{E}(E_{11}) - \\mathcal{E}(E_{22}) = E_{11} - E_{22} = X_z$.\n    $X_z$ is also a fixed point of $\\mathcal{E}$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{E}^{r-1}(X_z) = X_z$ for any $r \\ge 1$.\n4.  Apply the second operator insertion: $\\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z}(X_z) = A^0 X_z A^0 - A^1 X_z A^1$.\n    $A^0 X_z A^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = E_{11}$.\n    $A^1 X_z A^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -E_{22}$.\n    So, $\\mathcal{E}_{\\sigma^z}(X_z) = E_{11} - (-E_{22}) = E_{11} + E_{22} = I$.\n5.  Contract with the left environment $L=I$. The numerator becomes $\\mathrm{Tr}(L \\cdot I) = \\mathrm{Tr}(I \\cdot I) = \\mathrm{Tr}(I) = 2$.\nThe normalized two-point function is $\\langle \\sigma^z_i \\sigma^z_{i+r} \\rangle = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$. This result holds for any finite $r \\ge 1$.\n\nThe connected two-point correlation function is defined as $C_{zz}(r) = \\langle \\sigma^z_i \\sigma^z_{i+r} \\rangle - \\langle \\sigma^z_i \\rangle^2$.\nUsing our results from the thermodynamic limit:\n$$ C_{zz}(r) = 1 - (0)^2 = 1 $$\n\n**Part 3: Long-Distance Limit**\n\nWe need to compute the limit of the connected correlator as the separation $r$ goes to infinity.\nSince we found that $C_{zz}(r) = 1$ for any finite distance $r \\ge 1$, the limit is:\n$$ \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} C_{zz}(r) = \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} 1 = 1 $$\nThis non-vanishing value at infinite distance confirms the existence of long-range order in the state, a direct consequence of the degenerate fixed points of the transfer matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3492584"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise showed what a Matrix Product State (MPS) can represent, this practice explores how we find the optimal MPS ground state using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm.

In a mixed canonical gauge with the orthogonality center at the updated site, the effective norm matrix $N$ is the identity, so the local problem is a standard Hermitian eigenproblem. If one instead solves via normal equations (e.g., by forming $X^{\\dagger} X$ in a least-squares or by naively pre-multiplying by $N$ to eliminate $N$), the $2$-norm condition number is squared relative to the underlying map, which degrades numerical stability and increases sensitivity to roundoff.\n\nB. Davidson-type and Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) eigensolvers are appropriate for the local DMRG eigenproblem because the operator is Hermitian, accessed via matrix-free tensor contractions, and one can exploit: a high-quality initial guess from the previous site or sweep; simple, effective preconditioners built from the diagonal of $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} - \\lambda I$ or from environment approximations; and, for near-degeneracies from symmetries, block subspaces that accelerate convergence.\n\nC. A reliable and general stopping criterion for the local solve is to require the absolute residual $\\|r\\|_{2} = \\|H_{\\mathrm{eff}} a - \\lambda a\\|_{2}$ to be below a fixed threshold such as $10^{-12}$, independent of the scale of $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, without reference to relative residual, energy variance, or outer-sweep consistency; this absolute threshold is sufficient to guarantee both local and global convergence.\n\nD.

Because the Rayleigh quotient is monotonically nonincreasing under local minimization, any detected stationary point of the one-site DMRG update is necessarily the global ground state for the given bond dimension, so it is safe to stop as soon as the Rayleigh quotient ceases to decrease, even in the presence of nonconvex constraints induced by finite bond dimension.\n\nSelect all that apply.

It is a correct and well-formulated question about the numerical implementation of the DMRG algorithm. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the one-site DMRG algorithm is the variational optimization of a single tensor $a$ at a site $i$, which amounts to finding the ground state of the effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ within the local basis. This is expressed as the eigenproblem $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} a = \\lambda N a$, where we seek the eigenvector $a$ corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n\nThis statement addresses the case of a mixed-canonical MPS and the numerical stability of solving the resulting eigenproblem.\n1.  **Gauge and Norm Matrix:** The problem states that in a mixed canonical gauge with the orthogonality center at the site $i$ being updated, the left and right environments consist of orthonormal bases. The overlap matrix $N$ is formed by contracting these environments, and due to their orthonormality, $N$ correctly reduces to the identity matrix $I$. The generalized eigenproblem $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} a = \\lambda N a$ thus simplifies to the standard Hermitian eigenproblem $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} a = \\lambda a$. This part of the statement is correct.\n2.  **Normal Equations and Condition Number:** The statement warns against solving the problem via a method analogous to forming normal equations. The fourth base fact states that forming $X^\\dagger X$ from a matrix $X$ squares its singular values. The condition number, being the ratio of the largest to the smallest singular value, $\\kappa_2(X) = \\sigma_{\\text{max}}/\\sigma_{\\text{min}}$, therefore becomes $\\kappa_2(X^\\dagger X) = \\sigma_{\\text{max}}^2/\\sigma_{\\text{min}}^2 = (\\kappa_2(X))^2$. This squaring of the condition number is a well-known source of numerical instability, as it amplifies the effect of roundoff errors. A method exhibiting this behavior for the eigenproblem $H a = \\lambda a$ would be to try to find a non-trivial solution to the homogeneous equation $(H - \\lambda I)a = 0$ by minimizing $\\|(H - \\lambda I)a\\|_2^2$. This is equivalent to solving the normal equations $(H - \\lambda I)^\\dagger(H - \\lambda I)a = 0$. Since $H$ is Hermitian, this becomes $(H - \\lambda I)^2 a = 0$. The operator is now $(H - \\lambda I)^2$, and its condition number is the square of the condition number of $(H - \\lambda I)$. Thus, the statement accurately identifies a numerical pitfall and its consequences, which are directly supported by the provided base facts on linear algebra.\n\nThe statement is a valid and important point about the numerical linear algebra involved.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n\nThis statement proposes specific iterative eigensolvers and justifies their suitability.\n1.  **Hermitian, Matrix-Free Problem:** The local DMRG eigenproblem, whether standard ($H_{\\mathrm{eff}} a = \\lambda a$) or generalized ($H_{\\mathrm{eff}} a = \\lambda N a$), involves a Hermitian operator (or a Hermitian pair). Iterative solvers like the Davidson method and LOBPCG (Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient) are designed precisely for finding a few extreme eigenpairs of large, sparse, or structured Hermitian matrices. Furthermore, in DMRG, the matrix $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is never explicitly formed; its action on a vector $a$ is computed \"on the fly\" through a series of tensor contractions. This is a \"matrix-free\" application, which is a primary use case for these iterative methods.\n2.  **Initial Guess:** In a DMRG sweep, the tensor at site $i$ is optimized after site $i-1$ (or $i+1$) has just been updated. This recently optimized neighboring tensor provides a very good approximation to the new optimal tensor at site $i$, serving as a high-quality initial guess for the iterative solver. This dramatically reduces the number of iterations needed for convergence.\n3.  **Preconditioning:** Iterative methods are greatly accelerated by preconditioning. For an eigenproblem $H a = \\lambda a$, a good preconditioner approximates $(H - \\tilde{\\lambda} I)^{-1}$, where $\\tilde{\\lambda}$ is the current eigenvalue estimate. A simple and often effective choice is the inverse of the diagonal part of $(H - \\tilde{\\lambda} I)$. In DMRG, the diagonal of $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ can often be computed efficiently. More sophisticated preconditioners can be constructed from approximations to the environment tensors. Both Davidson and LOBPCG are built to leverage such preconditioners.\n4.  **Block Methods for Degeneracy:** If the physical system has symmetries, the ground state may be degenerate or nearly degenerate. Single-vector methods can struggle to converge or may collapse to an arbitrary linear combination of the degenerate states. Block methods like LOBPCG or block Davidson maintain and optimize a subspace of multiple vectors simultaneously, allowing them to robustly and efficiently find the entire low-energy subspace.\n\nAll points listed are correct and represent standard practice and reasoning in the field.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\n\nThis statement proposes a specific stopping criterion for the local solver.\n1.  **Absolute vs. Relative Residual:** The residual norm $\\|r\\|_{2} = \\|H_{\\mathrm{eff}} a - \\lambda a\\|_{2}$ measures the error in the eigen-equation. However, its magnitude is proportional to the scale of the operator, i.e., $\\|H_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\|_2$. If the Hamiltonian is rescaled, $H \\rightarrow c H$, then for the same relative error in the eigenvector, the residual norm also scales as $\\|r\\|_2 \\rightarrow |c| \\|r\\|_2$. A fixed absolute threshold like $10^{-12}$ is therefore not a robust criterion; it would be overly stringent for systems with large energy scales and too lenient for those with small energy scales. A scale-independent, *relative* residual is required for a generally applicable criterion.\n2.  **Sufficiency for Global Convergence:** DMRG is a variational optimization on the non-convex manifold of MPS of a fixed bond dimension. The overall procedure, consisting of sweeps back and forth, is a form of alternating minimization. Such an algorithm is only guaranteed to find a *local* minimum of the energy functional. Achieving extremely high precision in one of the sub-steps (the local eigenproblem) does not, and cannot, guarantee that the overall algorithm will escape a local minimum and find the global ground state. Thus, perfect local convergence is not sufficient for global convergence.\n\nThe proposed criterion is fragile and the conclusion about global convergence is incorrect.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n\nThis statement describes a multi-faceted stopping strategy.\n1.  **Coupled Indicators:** It correctly advocates for a strategy that combines multiple heuristics, which is standard for robust numerical algorithms.\n2.  **Relative Residual:** It suggests using a relative residual, e.g., $\\|r\\|_{2}/(\\|H_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\|_{2}\\,\\|a\\|_{2})$ or $\\|r\\|_{2}/(1+|\\lambda|)$. This correctly addresses the scale-dependence issue identified in the critique of option C.\n3.  **Energy Variance:** The energy variance $\\langle H^2 \\rangle - \\langle H \\rangle^2$ for a normalized state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is equal to $\\|(H - \\langle H \\rangle I)\\psi\\|_2^2$. This is precisely the squared norm of the residual if we identify the Rayleigh quotient $\\langle H \\rangle$ with the eigenvalue estimate $\\lambda$. Thus, monitoring the variance is physically intuitive and equivalent to monitoring the residual.\n4.  **Outer Loop Convergence:** A robust scheme must monitor the convergence of the overall algorithm, not just the sub-problems. The ultimate goal is to find the minimum energy of the MPS. Therefore, tracking the change in the global energy between sweeps and stopping when it stagnates is the primary criterion for terminating the entire DMRG procedure.\n5.  **Capping Iterations:** Solving the local eigenproblem to very high precision is computationally wasteful if the environments (i.e., the rest of the MPS) are still far from their optimal form. This is known as \"oversolving\". Capping the number of inner iterations (e.g., Davidson steps) per site is a crucial practical technique to balance computational effort and ensure steady progress of the outer loop. The local solver's tolerance can be made adaptive, becoming stricter as the global energy converges.\n\nThis statement accurately describes a sophisticated and practical convergence strategy used in real-world DMRG implementations.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\n\nThis statement makes a strong claim about the global optimality of any stationary point.\n1.  **Monotonicity:** The DMRG algorithm variationally minimizes the energy at each step. Therefore, the Rayleigh quotient of the full MPS is guaranteed to be monotonically non-increasing throughout the procedure. This part is correct.\n2.  **Stationary Point vs. Global Minimum:** The energy functional $E(\\text{MPS}) = \\langle \\psi | H | \\psi \\rangle / \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle$ is a non-convex function over the parameter space of the MPS tensors. Alternating minimization schemes like DMRG are greedy algorithms that follow a path of steepest descent in this landscape. While they are guaranteed to converge to a stationary point (where the energy gradient is zero), this point is often a local minimum, not necessarily the global minimum corresponding to the true ground state for the given bond dimension. The final state can be highly dependent on the initial random state or on conserved quantum numbers that trap the search in a specific symmetry sector. The a-priori guarantee is only for a local optimum.\n3.  **Safety of Stopping:** Because the stationary point may not be the global minimum, it is not \"safe\" to stop in the sense of having found the best possible approximation. The statement that any stationary point is \"necessarily the global ground state\" is fundamentally incorrect due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem, which the statement itself mentions.\n\nThe claim misinterprets the implications of monotonic convergence in a non-convex optimization setting.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "3492589"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond one-dimensional systems, this final practice explores the application of tensor network methods to two-dimensional models, a crucial step towards simulating realistic quantum materials.

The partition function is $Z = \\sum_{\\{\\sigma\\}} \\exp\\!\\left(K \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j \\right)$. It is well known that $Z$ can be expressed as a contraction of a uniform network of identical local rank-$4$ tensors $T_{u d l r}$ (up, down, left, right) on the square lattice, with each index taking $D=2$ values, so that $Z = \\mathrm{tTr}\\, \\bigotimes T$, where $\\mathrm{tTr}$ denotes contraction over all shared indices. The Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) performs coarse-graining by locally regrouping tensors and factorizing them such that the network is mapped to a coarser lattice while preserving $Z$ exactly if no truncation is performed. In practice, one replaces exact factorizations by approximate ones using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), truncating to a fixed bond dimension $\\chi$ by keeping only the largest $\\chi$ singular values at each step, and iterates until a single effective tensor remains whose scalar contraction approximates $Z$.\n\nStarting from these definitions and without appealing to any pre-derived shortcut formulas, reason about the renormalization group flow of the tensor network under TRG in gapped versus critical regimes, and how truncation impacts fixed points and accuracy.

A full analysis of the options will be performed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe TRG algorithm iteratively coarse-grains a tensor network. A key step involves reshaping a tensor or a block of tensors into a matrix, performing an SVD, and truncating the singular value spectrum to a bond dimension $\\chi$. The behavior of this truncation is fundamentally different in gapped and critical phases.\n\n- In a **gapped phase**, correlations decay exponentially with distance. This implies that across any cut, the amount of correlation is limited. In the SVD step, this is reflected by a rapid, exponential decay of the singular values. A relatively small, finite $\\chi$ is sufficient to capture the physics with high accuracy, as the discarded singular values are exponentially small. The RG flow converges to a simple, trivial fixed-point tensor.\n\n- At a **critical point**, correlations decay algebraically. The system is scale-invariant. To capture this long-range correlation structure, a large number of states are needed across any cut. This is reflected in a slow, algebraic decay of the singular values in the SVD. Any truncation to a finite $\\chi$ discards a significant amount of information. This truncation introduces an artificial correlation length into the system, effectively breaking the scale invariance. In the language of RG, this finite-$\\chi$ truncation acts as a relevant perturbation that drives the flow away from the true critical fixed point.\n\nWith these principles, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In the thermodynamic limit at a critical point, TRG with any finite bond dimension $\\chi$ produces a scale-invariant fixed-point tensor whose spectrum directly encodes the universal central charge $c$ of the associated Conformal Field Theory (CFT).**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The core difficulty of applying standard TRG to critical systems is precisely that a finite bond dimension $\\chi$ is a relevant perturbation. The truncation introduces an artificial length scale, $\\xi_\\chi$, which breaks the scale invariance of the critical point. Consequently, the RG flow does not converge to the true, scale-invariant fixed-point tensor of the underlying CFT. Instead, it flows to a different, non-universal fixed point that is an artifact of the truncation. Because the algorithm fails to reproduce the correct critical fixed point, it cannot be used to reliably extract universal CFT data like the central charge $c$. More advanced methods like MERA or improved versions of TRG (e.g., TNR) are required to correctly handle critical systems.\n\n**Verdict on A: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. In a gapped phase away from criticality, TRG flow with finite $\\chi$ systematically generates spurious topological order, leading to a fixed-point tensor with nontrivial degeneracy even for models with trivial short-range physics.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. TRG is highly effective in gapped phases. The exponential decay of correlations means the singular value spectra decay exponentially, so truncation to a finite $\\chi$ is a very good approximation. The RG flow correctly converges to a trivial fixed-point tensor corresponding to the simple, short-range correlated nature of the gapped phase (e.g., a ferromagnetic or paramagnetic phase). Spurious topological order, which is characterized by non-local correlations and a ground-state degeneracy that depends on the topology of the manifold, is not generated. In fact, truncation tends to destroy long-range correlations, making it antithetical to the spontaneous generation of complex, non-local ordered structures.\n\n**Verdict on B: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Near a critical point, algebraic correlations make the relevant SVD spectra broad, so any finite $\\chi$ acts as a relevant perturbation; in standard TRG this drives the flow toward a non-universal “corner-double-line” fixed point dominated by short-range structures, thereby obscuring universal data.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It provides a precise description of the failure mode of standard TRG at criticality.\n1.  **\"Algebraic correlations make the relevant SVD spectra broad\"**: At criticality, the slow (algebraic) decay of correlations requires a large number of singular values to approximate a bipartition. The spectrum is \"broad\" or \"fat-tailed\" compared to the exponential decay in a gapped phase.\n2.  **\"Any finite $\\chi$ acts as a relevant perturbation\"**: The truncation to a finite $\\chi$ breaks the scale invariance and introduces a finite correlation length. In RG terminology, this is a relevant perturbation that drives the system away from the critical fixed point.\n3.  **\"Drives the flow toward a non-universal 'corner-double-line' fixed point\"**: This describes the specific pathology of the standard TRG algorithm as proposed by Levin and Nave. The anisotropic way the tensors are decomposed and reconnected tends to create artifacts where the tensor elements are large only for index configurations that form disconnected \"lines\" through the lattice, effectively breaking the lattice into weakly coupled 1D systems. This fixed point is an artifact of the algorithm's geometry and truncation, is non-universal, and contains no information about the true critical physics.\n\n**Verdict on C: Correct.**\n\n**D. If at every SVD step no singular values are discarded (i.e., $\\chi$ is at least the exact rank of the reshaped tensors at that step), the sequence of algebraic regroupings and decompositions in TRG leaves $Z$ invariant on any finite lattice; errors arise only due to truncation.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It is essentially a statement about the mathematical construction of the TRG algorithm. The algorithm consists of a sequence of operations:\n-   Tensor contractions: An exact algebraic operation.\n-   Reshaping tensors into matrices: An exact re-indexing operation.\n-   Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): A matrix $M$ is decomposed as $M = U \\Sigma V^\\dagger$. This decomposition is itself exact.\nThe TRG procedure is designed such that the total partition function $Z$, which is the full contraction of the tensor network, remains invariant under these exact steps. For example, contracting tensors across a bond $k$ and then re-decomposing that bond via SVD as $\\sum_i A_{...i} B_{i...} = \\sum_{j,k} A_{...j} (U \\Sigma V^\\dagger)_{jk} B_{k...}$ is exact if the full SVD is used. An error is introduced *only when* the SVD is approximated by keeping a truncated number of singular values, i.e., $M \\approx \\tilde{U} \\tilde{\\Sigma} \\tilde{V}^\\dagger$, where the tildes indicate truncated matrices. Therefore, the only source of error in the algorithm is the truncation step. If no truncation occurs, the algorithm is exact.\n\n**Verdict on D: Correct.**\n\n**E. At low temperature in the ferromagnetic Ising model, TRG reaches a pair of distinct fixed-point tensors related by the broken $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry already at finite size with symmetric boundary conditions, independent of system size and boundary selection.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a phenomenon that occurs strictly in the thermodynamic limit ($N \\to \\infty$). On any **finite** lattice with symmetric boundary conditions (e.g., periodic), the system cannot spontaneously break a global symmetry. The partition function $Z$ sums over all configurations, including both \"mostly up\" and \"mostly down\" states, and physical observables like the total magnetization have a zero expectation value. The initial tensor $T_{udlr}$ for the Ising model is invariant under the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin-flip symmetry (up to a gauge transformation on the indices, which is absorbed into the contractions). The TRG algorithm itself is composed of symmetric operations. Therefore, starting from a symmetric tensor and applying a symmetric algorithm will necessarily produce a sequence of effective tensors that are also $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric. The flow will converge to a **single**, symmetric fixed-point tensor, which represents a quantum-like superposition of the two ordered states. To access one of the symmetry-broken fixed points, one must introduce an explicit, albeit infinitesimal, symmetry-breaking field in the Hamiltonian before taking the thermodynamic limit.\n\n**Verdict on E: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CD}$$", "id": "3492572"}]}
