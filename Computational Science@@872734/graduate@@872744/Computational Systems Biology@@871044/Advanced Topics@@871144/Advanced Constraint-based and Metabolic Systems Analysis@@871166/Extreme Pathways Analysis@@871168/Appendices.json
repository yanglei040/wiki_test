I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state condition $S v = 0$ for a flux vector $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4)^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$. The additional constraint is that all reactions are irreversible, so $v_j \\geq 0$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe matrix equation $S v = 0$ corresponds to the following system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  -1  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  -1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_4 \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis system expands to:\n1.  $1 \\cdot v_1 - 1 \\cdot v_2 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_2$\n2.  $1 \\cdot v_2 - 1 \\cdot v_3 = 0 \\implies v_2 = v_3$\n3.  $-1 \\cdot v_4 = 0 \\implies v_4 = 0$\n4.  $1 \\cdot v_4 = 0 \\implies v_4 = 0$\n\nFrom these equations, we deduce that any feasible steady-state flux vector must satisfy $v_1 = v_2 = v_3$ and $v_4 = 0$.\n\n**Identification of Blocked Reactions**\nA reaction $j$ is defined as blocked if its flux $v_j$ must be zero for every vector in the feasible flux cone $\\mathcal{C}$. Our analysis showed that for any $v \\in \\mathcal{C}$, the component $v_4$ must be $0$. Therefore, reaction $r_4$ is a blocked reaction.\nThe other reactions, $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$, are not blocked. For example, the flux vector $v = (1, 1, 1, 0)^T$ satisfies both $S v = 0$ and $v \\geq 0$, and for this vector, $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are all non-zero.\n\n**Construction of the Reduced Stoichiometric Matrix $S_{\\mathrm{red}}$**\nThe reduction procedure involves removing the column corresponding to the blocked reaction $r_4$ and the rows corresponding to dead-end metabolites (metabolites involved only in blocked reactions).\nMetabolite $x$ corresponds to the third row of $S$. Its only non-zero stoichiometric coefficient is in the column for $r_4$. Metabolite $y$ corresponds to the fourth row, and it also only participates in $r_4$. Since $r_4$ is the only blocked reaction, both $x$ and $y$ are dead-end metabolites.\nWe remove column $4$ and rows $3$ and $4$ from the original matrix $S$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  0 \\\\ 0  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nThis reduced matrix represents the stoichiometry for the active part of the network involving metabolites $(b, c)$ and reactions $(r_1, r_2, r_3)$.\n\n**Enumeration of Extreme Pathways of the Original Network**\nThe feasible flux cone for the original network is $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4} \\mid v_1 = v_2 = v_3, v_4 = 0, v_j \\geq 0 \\}$.\nAny vector $v \\in \\mathcal{C}$ can be expressed as a non-negative scalar multiple of a basis vector. Let $\\alpha = v_1$. Since $v_1 \\geq 0$, we have $\\alpha \\geq 0$. Then $v$ can be written as:\n$$ v = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nGeometrically, the cone $\\mathcal{C}$ is a single ray in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ starting at the origin and pointing in the direction of the vector $p_1 = (1, 1, 1, 0)^T$. An extreme pathway is an extreme ray of this cone. A cone that is a single ray is a $1$-dimensional convex set. Its extreme points are just the ray itself (when considered as a generator). Thus, there is exactly one extreme pathway. We can represent it by the vector $p_1$. The number of extreme pathways before reduction is $1$.\n\n**Enumeration of Extreme Pathways of the Reduced Network**\nThe feasible flux cone for the reduced network is $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\{ v_{\\mathrm{red}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid S_{\\mathrm{red}} v_{\\mathrm{red}} = 0, v_{\\mathrm{red}} \\geq 0 \\}$, where $v_{\\mathrm{red}} = (v_1, v_2, v_3)^T$.\nThe condition $S_{\\mathrm{red}} v_{\\mathrm{red}} = 0$ leads to the system:\n1.  $v_1 - v_2 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_2$\n2.  $v_2 - v_3 = 0 \\implies v_2 = v_3$\nSo, $v_1 = v_2 = v_3$. Let $\\alpha = v_1$. The constraint $v_{\\mathrm{red}} \\geq 0$ implies $\\alpha \\geq 0$. Any vector in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{red}}$ can be written as:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha \\end{pmatrix} = \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nThis cone, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{red}}$, is also a single ray, this time in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, generated by the vector $p_{\\mathrm{red}} = (1, 1, 1)^T$. By the same logic as for the original network, this system has exactly one extreme pathway. The number of extreme pathways after reduction is $1$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the change in the number of extreme pathways, defined as $(\\text{after reduction}) - (\\text{before reduction})$.\nNumber of extreme pathways before reduction = $1$.\nNumber of extreme pathways after reduction = $1$.\nChange = $1 - 1 = 0$.\nThe blocked reaction and its associated dead-end metabolites form a disconnected, non-functional part of the network that does not contribute any steady-state pathways. Its removal does not alter the pathway structure of the functional part of the network.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3307828"}, {"introduction": "Metabolic networks can be altered through evolution or bioengineering, often by adding new reactions.

The network consists of an uptake reaction of metabolite $A$ from the environment, two branch conversions from $A$ to $B$ and from $A$ to $C$, and exports of $B$ and $C$ to the environment. The steady-state condition is $S v = 0$, where $v$ is the flux vector. Extreme Pathways (EP) analysis defines the flux cone as the set $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid S v = 0, v \\geq 0\\}$ and characterizes its geometry by its extreme rays (extreme pathways), which are the minimal set of generating rays of this convex cone. Enumerate the extreme pathways before and after adding a new export reaction for $A$ and quantify the effect on both the number and geometry of extreme pathways.\n\nSpecifically, the initial network has reactions:\n- $v_{1}$: environmental uptake of $A$, with stoichiometry for internal rows $\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$,\n- $v_{2}$: conversion $A \\to B$, with stoichiometry $\\begin{pmatrix}-1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$,\n- $v_{3}$: conversion $A \\to C$, with stoichiometry $\\begin{pmatrix}-1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$,\n- $v_{4}$: export of $B$, with stoichiometry $\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$,\n- $v_{5}$: export of $C$, with stoichiometry $\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThus, the stoichiometric matrix is\n$$\nS_{\\text{before}} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  -1  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  0  -1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nYou then add a new export reaction:\n- $v_{6}$: export of $A$, with stoichiometry $\\begin{pmatrix}-1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$,\n\nso the updated stoichiometric matrix is\n$$\nS_{\\text{after}} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  -1  0  0  -1 \\\\\n0  1  0  -1  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  -1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nAssume irreversible fluxes $v_{i} \\geq 0$ for all $i$, and steady-state $S v = 0$.

It presents a standard exercise in Extreme Pathway (EP) analysis, a core methodology in computational systems biology. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to enumerate the extreme pathways for a biochemical network under two conditions: before and after the addition of a new reaction. We then need to quantify the effect of this addition by calculating the change in the number of extreme pathways and the change in the average pairwise angle between the canonical representations of these pathways.\n\nAn extreme pathway is a minimal generating vector for the steady-state flux cone, which is defined by the set of solutions to $S v = 0$ with the constraint that all fluxes $v_i \\geq 0$.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the Initial Network (Before Addition)**\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix is given as:\n$$\nS_{\\text{before}} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  -1  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  0  -1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe steady-state condition $S_{\\text{before}} v = 0$ corresponds to the following system of linear equations for the flux vector $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5)^T$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nv_1 - v_2 - v_3 = 0 \\\\\nv_2 - v_4 = 0 \\\\\nv_3 - v_5 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the second and third equations, we have $v_2 = v_4$ and $v_3 = v_5$. Substituting these into the first equation yields $v_1 = v_2 + v_3$.\n\nThe flux cone is spanned by vectors $v$ where all components are non-negative. We can express the general solution in terms of free variables. Let's choose $v_2$ and $v_3$ as the free variables, since $v_2 \\geq 0$ and $v_3 \\geq 0$. The flux vector $v$ can be written as:\n$$\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_4 \\\\ v_5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_2 + v_3 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix} = v_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + v_3 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince any valid flux vector $v$ must be a non-negative combination of these two basis vectors, they represent the extreme pathways of the network. Let's denote them as $p^{(1)}$ and $p^{(2)}$:\n$$\np^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a canonical normalization where the uptake flux $v_1 = 1$. For both $p^{(1)}$ and $p^{(2)}$, the first component is already $1$. Thus, the canonical extreme pathways, which we denote as $u^{(1)}$ and $u^{(2)}$, are identical to $p^{(1)}$ and $p^{(2)}$:\n$$\nu^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad u^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe number of extreme pathways before the addition is $N_{\\text{before}} = 2$.\n\nThere is only one pair of pathways, so the average pairwise angle is simply the angle between $u^{(1)}$ and $u^{(2)}$. The angle $\\theta(u^{(1)}, u^{(2)})$ is calculated as:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\text{before}} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{u^{(1)} \\cdot u^{(2)}}{\\|u^{(1)}\\|\\;\\|u^{(2)}\\|}\\right)\n$$\nWe compute the dot product and the norms:\n$$\nu^{(1)} \\cdot u^{(2)} = (1)(1) + (1)(0) + (0)(1) + (1)(0) + (0)(1) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\|u^{(1)}\\|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 = 3 \\implies \\|u^{(1)}\\| = \\sqrt{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\|u^{(2)}\\|^2 = 1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 3 \\implies \\|u^{(2)}\\| = \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nTherefore, the angle is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\text{before}} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of the Updated Network (After Addition)**\n\nA new export reaction for metabolite $A$, $v_6$, is added.

Let $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$ denote the set of fluxes satisfying $S v = 0$, $v \\ge 0$, and $v_{i}^{\\pm} \\Delta G(R_{i}^{\\pm}) \\le 0$ for all four split reactions.\n\nFrom first principles, analyze the geometric effect of the added energy inequalities on the feasible cone and deduce the cardinality of the extreme pathways (extreme rays) of $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$. Finally, provide a single numerical value equal to the decrease in the number of extreme pathways when passing from $C$ to $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$. You must fully justify every step using only the core definitions of steady-state mass balance, convex cones, extreme rays, and thermodynamic inequalities, and you must derive the answer from scratch. The final answer must be a single integer. No rounding is required and no units apply.", "solution": "The problem requires a three-part analysis of a toy metabolic network, culminating in the calculation of the decrease in the number of extreme pathways upon imposing thermodynamic constraints. The analysis will proceed from first principles as stipulated.\n\nThe network involves two metabolites, $A$ and $B$, and four irreversible reactions, $R_{1}^{+}: A \\to B$, $R_{1}^{-}: B \\to A$, $R_{2}^{+}: A \\to B$, and $R_{2}^{-}: B \\to A$, with corresponding non-negative fluxes $v_{1}^{+}$, $v_{1}^{-}$, $v_{2}^{+}$, and $v_{2}^{-}$. The steady-state condition is given by $S v = 0$, where $v = (v_{1}^{+}, v_{1}^{-}, v_{2}^{+}, v_{2}^{-})^T$ and the stoichiometric matrix is $S = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  -1  1 \\\\ 1  -1  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix equation expands to two linear equations:\n$$\n-v_{1}^{+} + v_{1}^{-} - v_{2}^{+} + v_{2}^{-} = 0\n$$\n$$\nv_{1}^{+} - v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{+} - v_{2}^{-} = 0\n$$\nIt is immediately apparent that the second equation is the negative of the first. Therefore, the system is described by a single unique linear constraint:\n$$\nv_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}\n$$\nThis equation represents the conservation of mass at steady state: the total flux producing $B$ from $A$ (and consuming $A$) must equal the total flux producing $A$ from $B$ (and consuming $B$). The flux cone $C$ is the set of all vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ satisfying this equation and the non-negativity constraint $v \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate the existence of internal cycles. An internal cycle is a non-zero flux vector $v \\in C$ that results in no net production or consumption of metabolites from the environment. As this model contains no exchange reactions, any non-zero $v \\in C$ represents an internal flux mode. A futile cycle specifically refers to a loop of reactions that consumes energy without net chemical conversion, for instance, $A \\to B \\to A$. Let us construct such a cycle using reaction $R_{1}^{+}$ ($A \\to B$) and reaction $R_{2}^{-}$ ($B \\to A$). We can define a flux vector $v_c$ corresponding to this cycle:\n$$\nv_c = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis vector must be an element of the cone $C$. We check the two conditions for membership in $C$:\n$1$. Non-negativity: $v_c \\ge 0$. All components of $v_c$ are non-negative, so this is satisfied.\n$2$. Steady state: $S v_c = 0$. We check the simplified constraint $v_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}$:\n$$\n1 + 0 = 0 + 1 \\implies 1 = 1\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Since $v_c$ is a non-zero vector in $C$, we have explicitly constructed a feasible flux distribution that represents an internal futile cycle. This demonstrates that the splitting of reversible reactions and the imposition of non-negativity constraints alone permit such cycles.\n\nSecond, we determine all extreme pathways of the cone $C$. Extreme pathways are the minimal, non-decomposable generating vectors (extreme rays) of the convex cone $C$. A flux vector is an extreme pathway if the set of reactions with non-zero flux is minimal, meaning no proper non-empty subset of these active reactions can satisfy the steady-state condition on its own. We search for such minimal sets of reactions. The governing equation is $v_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}$.\nLet's test minimal combinations of reactions (columns of $S$):\n- Set $1$: $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{1}^{-}\\}$. The steady-state condition for this subset is $v_{1}^{+} = v_{1}^{-}$. A minimal positive integer solution is $v_{1}^{+}=1, v_{1}^{-}=1$. This gives the pathway $P_1 = (1, 1, 0, 0)^T$. This vector cannot be decomposed into other non-negative vectors in the cone.\n- Set $2$: $\\{R_{2}^{+}, R_{2}^{-}\\}$. The condition is $v_{2}^{+} = v_{2}^{-}$. A minimal solution gives the pathway $P_2 = (0, 0, 1, 1)^T$.\n- Set $3$: $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{2}^{-}\\}$. The condition is $v_{1}^{+} = v_{2}^{-}$. A minimal solution gives the pathway $P_3 = (1, 0, 0, 1)^T$. This corresponds to the futile cycle $A \\to B$ via $R_1$ and $B \\to A$ via $R_2$.\n- Set $4$: $\\{R_{2}^{+}, R_{1}^{-}\\}$. The condition is $v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-}$. A minimal solution gives the pathway $P_4 = (0, 1, 1, 0)^T$. This is the other futile cycle $A \\to B$ via $R_2$ and $B \\to A$ via $R_1$.\n\nAny combination involving only reactions that consume $A$ (e.g., $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{2}^{+}\\}$) or only reactions that produce $A$ (e.g., $\\{R_{1}^{-}, R_{2}^{-}\\}$) cannot satisfy the steady state condition with non-zero fluxes. For instance, for $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{2}^{+}\\}$, the condition is $v_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = 0$, which given $v \\ge 0$ implies $v_{1}^{+} = 0$ and $v_{2}^{+}=0$. Thus, no non-zero flux is possible. Any set of $3$ or $4$ reactions is not minimal. For example, a flux using $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{1}^{-}, R_{2}^{+}\\}$ such as $(1, 2, 1, 0)^T$ (where $1+1=2+0$ is false, should be $v_{1}^{+}+v_{2}^{+}=v_{1}^{-}$, so $1+1=2$) gives the vector $v = (1, 2, 1, 0)^T$. This vector can be decomposed as $P_4 + P_1 = (0, 1, 1, 0)^T + (1, 1, 0, 0)^T$. Hence, it is not an extreme pathway.\nThe four vectors $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, and $P_4$ constitute the complete set of minimal generating vectors for the cone $C$. The number of extreme pathways for $C$ is therefore $4$.\n\nThird, we incorporate thermodynamic constraints. We are given $\\mu_B - \\mu_A > 0$. Let this positive quantity be $\\Delta \\mu = \\mu_B - \\mu_A$. The Gibbs free energy changes for the four reactions are:\n- $\\Delta G(R_{1}^{+}) = \\mu_{B} - \\mu_{A} = \\Delta \\mu > 0$\n- $\\Delta G(R_{1}^{-}) = \\mu_{A} - \\mu_{B} = -\\Delta \\mu  0$\n- $\\Delta G(R_{2}^{+}) = \\mu_{B} - \\mu_{A} = \\Delta \\mu > 0$\n- $\\Delta G(R_{2}^{-}) = \\mu_{A} - \\mu_{B} = -\\Delta \\mu  0$\n\nThe energy-dissipation inequality is $v_{i}^{\\pm} \\Delta G(R_{i}^{\\pm}) \\le 0$. Since all fluxes $v_{i}^{\\pm}$ must be non-negative ($v_{i}^{\\pm} \\ge 0$), this inequality imposes conditions on the fluxes.\n- For $R_{1}^{+}$: $v_{1}^{+} \\Delta \\mu \\le 0$. Since $\\Delta \\mu > 0$, this implies $v_{1}^{+} = 0$.\n- For $R_{1}^{-}$: $v_{1}^{-} (-\\Delta \\mu) \\le 0$. Since $-\\Delta \\mu  0$, this is satisfied for any $v_{1}^{-} \\ge 0$.\n- For $R_{2}^{+}$: $v_{2}^{+} \\Delta \\mu \\le 0$. Since $\\Delta \\mu > 0$, this implies $v_{2}^{+} = 0$.\n- For $R_{2}^{-}$: $v_{2}^{-} (-\\Delta \\mu) \\le 0$. Since $-\\Delta \\mu  0$, this is satisfied for any $v_{2}^{-} \\ge 0$.\n\nThe new thermodynamically constrained cone, $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$, is defined by the set of fluxes $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ satisfying:\n$1$. $v \\ge 0$\n$2$. $v_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}$\n$3$. $v_{1}^{+} = 0$\n$4$. $v_{2}^{+} = 0$\n\nSubstituting the thermodynamic constraints ($v_{1}^{+} = 0$, $v_{2}^{+} = 0$) into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\n0 + 0 = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}\n$$\nSo, $v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-} = 0$. Given the non-negativity constraint ($v_{1}^{-} \\ge 0$ and $v_{2}^{-} \\ge 0$), the only solution to this equation is $v_{1}^{-} = 0$ and $v_{2}^{-} = 0$.\nTherefore, the only flux vector $v$ that satisfies all conditions for membership in $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$ is the zero vector:\n$$\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}^T\n$$\nGeometrically, the original cone $C$ has been intersected with the hyperplanes $v_{1}^{+}=0$ and $v_{2}^{+}=0$, which reduces the entire feasible space to the origin. An extreme pathway, by definition, is a non-zero vector that generates an extreme ray of the cone. Since the only element of $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$ is the zero vector, there are no non-zero vectors to form extreme rays. Consequently, the set of extreme pathways for $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$ is empty, and its cardinality is $0$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the decrease in the number of extreme pathways when passing from the purely stoichiometric cone $C$ to the thermodynamically constrained cone $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$.\n- Number of extreme pathways for $C$: $4$.\n- Number of extreme pathways for $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$: $0$.\nThe decrease in the number of extreme pathways is the difference: $4 - 0 = 4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3307861"}]}
