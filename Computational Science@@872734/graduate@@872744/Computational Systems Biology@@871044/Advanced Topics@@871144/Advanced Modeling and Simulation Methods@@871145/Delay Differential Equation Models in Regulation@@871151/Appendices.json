A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to nondimensionalize the given DDE using the specified substitutions. The starting DDE is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt}(t) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\dfrac{P(t-\\tau)}{K}\\right)^{n}} \\;-\\; \\gamma\\,P(t)\n$$\nWe introduce the dimensionless variables $s$ and $p(s)$ defined by the relations:\n$$\nt = \\frac{s}{\\gamma} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P(t) = K\\,p(s)\n$$\nFirst, we transform the derivative term on the left-hand side (LHS) using the chain rule. We need to express $\\frac{dP}{dt}$ in terms of $\\frac{dp}{ds}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( K\\,p(s) \\right) = K\\,\\frac{dp}{dt}\n$$\nNow, we apply the chain rule again to find $\\frac{dp}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{dp}{ds} \\frac{ds}{dt}\n$$\nFrom the definition $t = s/\\gamma$, we can express $s$ as $s = \\gamma t$. Differentiating $s$ with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{dt} = \\gamma\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we find the expression for the LHS:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = K\\,\\frac{dp}{ds}\\,\\gamma = K\\gamma\\,\\frac{dp}{ds}\n$$\nNext, we transform the terms on the right-hand side (RHS). The degradation term is straightforward:\n$$\n\\gamma P(t) = \\gamma (K\\,p(s)) = \\gamma K\\,p(s)\n$$\nFor the production term, we must first address the delayed concentration $P(t-\\tau)$. The time argument is $t-\\tau$. We substitute our definition for $t$:\n$$\nt - \\tau = \\frac{s}{\\gamma} - \\tau = \\frac{s - \\gamma\\tau}{\\gamma}\n$$\nThe problem asks to identify the dimensionless delay $\\theta = \\gamma\\tau$. Using this definition, the time argument becomes:\n$$\nt - \\tau = \\frac{s - \\theta}{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis shows that a time $t-\\tau$ in the original system corresponds to a dimensionless time $s-\\theta$ in the new system. Therefore, the delayed protein concentration is:\n$$\nP(t - \\tau) = K\\,p(s - \\theta)\n$$\nNow we can substitute this into the Hill repression term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\dfrac{P(t-\\tau)}{K}\\right)^{n}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\left(\\dfrac{K\\,p(s-\\theta)}{K}\\right)^{n}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + \\left(p(s-\\theta)\\right)^{n}}\n$$\nNow, we assemble the full equation by equating the transformed LHS and RHS:\n$$\nK\\gamma\\,\\frac{dp}{ds} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + p(s-\\theta)^{n}} - \\gamma K\\,p(s)\n$$\nTo obtain the final dimensionless form, we make the derivative term $\\frac{dp}{ds}$ have a coefficient of $1$. We achieve this by dividing the entire equation by the factor $K\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{ds} = \\frac{1}{K\\gamma} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + p(s-\\theta)^{n}} \\right) - \\frac{\\gamma K\\,p(s)}{K\\gamma}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the dimensionless DDE:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{ds} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{K\\gamma}\\right) \\frac{1}{1 + p(s-\\theta)^{n}} - p(s)\n$$\nIn this equation, $p$ and $s$ are dimensionless, and the Hill coefficient $n$ is inherently dimensionless. The dynamics are governed by two key dimensionless parameter groups:\n1.  The dimensionless delay, $\\theta = \\gamma\\tau$.\n2.  The dimensionless production amplitude, which is the prefactor of the production term.\n\nThe problem asks specifically for the single dimensionless group that combines $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$, and $K$ and controls the amplitude of the production term.

Substituting this ansatz into the DDE gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(C e^{\\lambda t}) = -\\alpha (C e^{\\lambda t}) - \\beta (C e^{\\lambda (t-\\tau)})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda C e^{\\lambda t} = -\\alpha C e^{\\lambda t} - \\beta C e^{\\lambda t} e^{-\\lambda \\tau}\n$$\nDividing by the non-zero term $C e^{\\lambda t}$, we obtain the characteristic equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\alpha - \\beta e^{-\\lambda \\tau}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\lambda + \\alpha + \\beta e^{-\\lambda \\tau} = 0\n$$\n\nThe steady state $x=0$ loses stability when at least one characteristic root $\\lambda$ crosses the imaginary axis from the left half-plane to the right half-plane. The boundary of stability is where there exists a root with zero real part. Such a root must be purely imaginary, as a zero root $\\lambda=0$ would imply $0 + \\alpha + \\beta = 0$, which is impossible since $\\alpha0$ and $\\beta0$.\n\nWe therefore search for a pair of purely imaginary roots, $\\lambda = \\pm i\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is a real, positive frequency ($\\omega  0$). Substituting $\\lambda = i\\omega$ into the characteristic equation yields:\n$$\ni\\omega + \\alpha + \\beta e^{-i\\omega\\tau} = 0\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{-i\\omega\\tau} = \\cos(\\omega\\tau) - i\\sin(\\omega\\tau)$, we get:\n$$\ni\\omega + \\alpha + \\beta (\\cos(\\omega\\tau) - i\\sin(\\omega\\tau)) = 0\n$$\nFor this complex-valued equation to hold, both its real and imaginary parts must be zero. Separating the real and imaginary components:\n$$\n(\\alpha + \\beta\\cos(\\omega\\tau)) + i(\\omega - \\beta\\sin(\\omega\\tau)) = 0\n$$\nThis gives us a system of two simultaneous equations:\n1.

Imaginary part: $\\omega - \\beta\\sin(\\omega\\tau) = 0 \\implies \\sin(\\omega\\tau) = \\frac{\\omega}{\\beta}$\n\nTo find the frequency $\\omega$ at which this Hopf crossing occurs, we use the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1$ with $\\theta = \\omega\\tau$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\beta}\\right)^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\beta^2} = 1\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\beta^2$ gives:\n$$\n\\alpha^2 + \\omega^2 = \\beta^2\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$:\n$$\n\\omega^2 = \\beta^2 - \\alpha^2\n$$\nFor a real, positive frequency $\\omega$ to exist, we must have $\\beta^2 - \\alpha^2  0$, which implies $\\beta^2  \\alpha^2$.

The frequency of oscillation at the bifurcation point is:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\alpha^2}\n$$\n\nNow we solve for the delay $\\tau$. From the system of equations, we have:\n$$\n\\tan(\\omega\\tau) = \\frac{\\sin(\\omega\\tau)}{\\cos(\\omega\\tau)} = \\frac{\\omega/\\beta}{-\\alpha/\\beta} = -\\frac{\\omega}{\\alpha}\n$$\nTo uniquely determine the angle $\\omega\\tau$, we observe the signs of the sine and cosine terms.\n-   $\\sin(\\omega\\tau) = \\omega/\\beta  0$ (since $\\omega  0, \\beta  0$)\n-   $\\cos(\\omega\\tau) = -\\alpha/\\beta  0$ (since $\\alpha  0, \\beta  0$)\nAn angle with a positive sine and a negative cosine must lie in the second quadrant. The $\\arccos$ function returns a value in $[0, \\pi]$. Since its argument $-\\alpha/\\beta$ is in $(-1, 0)$, $\\arccos(-\\alpha/\\beta)$ will be in $(\\pi/2, \\pi)$, which is in the second quadrant.

As $\\tau$ increases from $0$, $\\tau^{\\ast}$ is the first value of the delay at which a pair of roots reaches the imaginary axis. A more detailed analysis (the transversality condition) shows that the roots cross from left to right, hence the system loses stability at $\\tau = \\tau^{\\ast}$.
