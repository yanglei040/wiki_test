This equation establishes a direct dependency, constraining $x_{2}$ and $x_{3}$ to have identical values in any fixed point. We can substitute $x_{3}$ with $x_{2}$ in the other equations to reduce the complexity of the system.\n\nSubstituting $x_{3} = x_{2}$ into Equation (II) yields:\n$x_{2} = \\neg x_{1} \\land x_{2}$\nLet us call this Equation (II').\n\nThe problem is now reduced to solving the following system for $(x_{1}, x_{2})$:\nEquation (I): $x_{1} = x_{1} \\lor x_{2}$\nEquation (II'): $x_{2} = \\neg x_{1} \\land x_{2}$\n\nLet us analyze Equation (I), $x_{1} = x_{1} \\lor x_{2}$. The logical disjunction (OR) $A \\lor B$ is equal to $A$ if and only if $B$ does not affect the outcome, which occurs when either $A=1$ or $B=0$.

Thus, Equation (I) holds true if and only if $(x_{1} = 1) \\lor (x_{2} = 0)$. The only case excluded is $(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (0, 1)$.\n\nNext, let us analyze Equation (II'), $x_{2} = \\neg x_{1} \\land x_{2}$. The logical conjunction (AND) $A \\land B$ is equal to $B$ if and only if $A=1$ or $B=0$. In our case, this means either $\\neg x_{1} = 1$ (which implies $x_{1}=0$) or $x_{2}=0$.

We must first derive the possible periods of cycle attractors by analyzing iterates of $\\mathbf{F}$, and then enumerate the attractors to find their exact periods and compute the sum of these periods, $S$.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the iterates of the function $\\mathbf{F}$. A cycle attractor of period $p$ is a set of states $\\{\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}, \\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}^{(p-1)}\\}$ such that $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \\mathbf{x}^{(i+1 \\pmod p)}$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, p-1\\}$.

Let's find $\\mathbf{F}^{6}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{6}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{F}^{3}(\\mathbf{F}^{3}(\\mathbf{x})) = \\mathbf{F}^{3}(\\neg x_1, \\neg x_2, \\neg x_3)\n$$\nUsing the expression for $\\mathbf{F}^{3}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{3}(\\neg x_1, \\neg x_2, \\neg x_3) = (\\neg(\\neg x_1), \\neg(\\neg x_2), \\neg(\\neg x_3)) = (x_1, x_2, x_3) = \\mathbf{x}\n$$\nSo, we have found that $\\mathbf{F}^{6}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$ for all states $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{3}$.\nThis fundamental result implies that every state in the network is part of a periodic orbit. The state transition graph, therefore, consists of a set of disjoint cycles. These cycles are the attractors of the system, as they are recurrent sets with no outgoing edges. The period $p$ of any such cycle must be a divisor of $6$. Thus, the possible periods for any cycle attractor are $1$, $2$, $3$, or $6$.\n\nWe can check for the existence of cycles of these specific periods.\n- A cycle of period $p=1$ is a fixed point, where $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$. This requires $(\\neg x_3, \\neg x_1, \\neg x_2) = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$, which gives the system of equations $x_1 = \\neg x_3$, $x_2 = \\neg x_1$, and $x_3 = \\neg x_2$. Substituting the third into the first gives $x_1 = \\neg(\\neg x_2) = x_2$. Then the second equation becomes $x_1 = \\neg x_1$. For $x_1 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, this equation has no solution. Thus, there are no fixed points.\n- A cycle of period $p=3$ would require $\\mathbf{F}^{3}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq \\mathbf{x}$. We found $\\mathbf{F}^{3}(\\mathbf{x}) = (\\neg x_1, \\neg x_2, \\neg x_3)$. The condition $\\mathbf{F}^{3}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$ becomes $(\\neg x_1, \\neg x_2, \\neg x_3) = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$, which requires $x_i = \\neg x_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. As seen before, this has no solution in $\\{0,1\\}^3$. Thus, there are no cycles of period $3$.\n\nThe only possible periods for the cycle attractors are $2$ and $6$.\n\nNow, we proceed to enumerate all cycle attractors by explicit iteration. The state space has $2^3 = 8$ states.\nLet's choose an arbitrary initial state, for instance, $\\mathbf{x}(0) = (0,0,0)$.\n- $\\mathbf{x}(0) = (0,0,0)$\n- $\\mathbf{x}(1) = \\mathbf{F}(0,0,0) = (\\neg 0, \\neg 0, \\neg 0) = (1,1,1)$\n- $\\mathbf{x}(2) = \\mathbf{F}(1,1,1) = (\\neg 1, \\neg 1, \\neg 1) = (0,0,0)$\nWe have returned to the initial state. This identifies one cycle attractor: $C_1 = \\{(0,0,0), (1,1,1)\\}$. The period of this attractor is $p_1 = 2$.\n\nThese two states are part of an attractor. There are $8 - 2 = 6$ states remaining. Let's pick one of them, for instance, $\\mathbf{x}(0) = (0,0,1)$.\n- $\\mathbf{x}(0) = (0,0,1)$\n- $\\mathbf{x}(1) = \\mathbf{F}(0,0,1) = (\\neg 1, \\neg 0, \\neg 0) = (0,1,1)$\n- $\\mathbf{x}(2) = \\mathbf{F}(0,1,1) = (\\neg 1, \\neg 0, \\neg 1) = (0,1,0)$\n- $\\mathbf{x}(3) = \\mathbf{F}(0,1,0) = (\\neg 0, \\neg 0, \\neg 1) = (1,1,0)$\n- $\\mathbf{x}(4) = \\mathbf{F}(1,1,0) = (\\neg 0, \\neg 1, \\neg 1) = (1,0,0)$\n- $\\mathbf{x}(5) = \\mathbf{F}(1,0,0) = (\\neg 0, \\neg 1, \\neg 0) = (1,0,1)$\n- $\\mathbf{x}(6) = \\mathbf{F}(1,0,1) = (\\neg 1, \\neg 1, \\neg 0) = (0,0,1)$\nWe have returned to the state $(0,0,1)$. This identifies a second cycle attractor: $C_2 = \\{(0,0,1), (0,1,1), (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,0,1)\\}$. The period of this attractor is $p_2 = 6$.\n\nThe two attractors, $C_1$ and $C_2$, contain $2+6=8$ distinct states. This accounts for the entire state space of the network. Therefore, we have found all attractors of the system.\nThe distinct cycle attractors have periods $p_1 = 2$ and $p_2 = 6$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $S$, the sum of the periods of all distinct cycle attractors.\n$$\nS = p_1 + p_2 = 2 + 6 = 8\n$$\nThe analysis confirms that the state transition graph consists of exactly two disjoint cycles, which are the only attractors.
