The system is described by the molecular counts of the species, $\\mathbf{x} = (x_A, x_B, x_C)^T$, in a fixed volume $\\Omega$.\n\nFirst, we derive the propensity function, which we denote as $a(\\mathbf{x})$. The derivation proceeds by relating the macroscopic deterministic rate law to the microscopic stochastic description.\n\nThe deterministic law of mass action states that the rate of the reaction, $v$, is proportional to the product of the reactant concentrations. For the reaction $A + B \\to C$, this is given by:\n$$v = k [A] [B]$$\nwhere $k$ is the macroscopic bimolecular rate constant, and $[A]$ and $[B]$ are the concentrations of species $A$ and $B$, respectively. The rate $v$ has units of concentration per unit time.\n\nTo find the total number of reaction events occurring per unit time within the entire volume $\\Omega$, we multiply the rate $v$ by the volume $\\Omega$. Let us call this macroscopic rate $R_{macro}$:\n$$R_{macro} = v \\Omega = k [A] [B] \\Omega$$\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between the concentration of a species $X$, denoted $[X]$, and its molecular count, $x_X$:\n$$[X] = \\frac{x_X}{\\Omega}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $[A]$ and $[B]$ into the equation for $R_{macro}$:\n$$R_{macro} = k \\left(\\frac{x_A}{\\Omega}\\right) \\left(\\frac{x_B}{\\Omega}\\right) \\Omega = \\frac{k}{\\Omega} x_A x_B$$\nThis expression represents the expected number of reaction events per unit time from a macroscopic, deterministic viewpoint.\n\nIn the stochastic chemical kinetics formalism, the propensity function $a(\\mathbf{x})$ is defined such that $a(\\mathbf{x}) dt$ is the probability that a single reaction event will occur in the system in the next infinitesimal time interval $[t, t+dt)$, given the state is $\\mathbf{x}$ at time $t$. The propensity function $a(\\mathbf{x})$ is therefore the expected number of reaction events per unit time, conditional on the state $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nThe fundamental link between the deterministic and stochastic frameworks is established by assuming that in the macroscopic limit (large numbers of molecules), the average stochastic rate equals the deterministic rate. Therefore, we equate the propensity function $a(\\mathbf{x})$ with the macroscopic rate $R_{macro}$:\n$$a(x_A, x_B) = R_{macro} = \\frac{k x_A x_B}{\\Omega}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the mass-action propensity of the reaction in terms of the given parameters.\n\nNext, we construct the stoichiometry column vector.

Its differential is $dY(t) = dX(t)$. Substituting $X(t) = Y(t) + X^{\\ast}$ into the CLE:\n$$dY(t) = (k_{b} - k_{d} (Y(t) + X^{\\ast})) dt + \\sqrt{k_{b} + k_{d} (Y(t) + X^{\\ast})} dW(t)$$\nUsing the fixed point condition $k_b = k_d X^{\\ast}$, the drift term simplifies:\n$$k_{b} - k_{d} Y(t) - k_{d} X^{\\ast} = (k_{d} X^{\\ast}) - k_{d} Y(t) - k_{d} X^{\\ast} = -k_{d} Y(t)$$\nThe SDE becomes:\n$$dY(t) = -k_{d} Y(t) dt + \\sqrt{k_{b} + k_{d}X^{\\ast} + k_{d}Y(t)} dW(t)$$\nUnder the linear noise approximation, the diffusion term is evaluated at the fixed point, meaning we set $Y(t) = 0$ inside the square root. The diffusion amplitude becomes a constant:\n$$\\sqrt{k_{b} + k_{d}X^{\\ast}} = \\sqrt{k_{b} + k_{d}\\left(\\frac{k_{b}}{k_{d}}\\right)} = \\sqrt{k_{b} + k_{b}} = \\sqrt{2k_{b}}$$\nThe resulting linearized SDE for $Y(t)$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:\n$$dY(t) = -k_{d} Y(t) dt + \\sqrt{2k_{b}} dW(t)$$\n\n**Part 3: Euler-Maruyama Discretization**\n\nThe explicit Euler-Maruyama (EM) method discretizes an SDE $dZ_t = a(Z_t)dt + b(Z_t)dW_t$ as $Z_{n+1} = Z_n + a(Z_n)h + b(Z_n)\\Delta W_n$, where $h$ is the time step and $\\Delta W_n = W(t_{n+1}) - W(t_n)$ is a random increment with distribution $N(0, h)$.\nApplying this to the linearized SDE for $Y(t)$, with drift coefficient $a(Y) = -k_d Y$ and constant diffusion coefficient $b(Y) = \\sqrt{2k_b}$, we get the one-step update for $Y_n \\approx Y(t_n)$:\n$$Y_{n+1} = Y_n + (-k_d Y_n)h + \\sqrt{2k_b} \\Delta W_n$$\n$$Y_{n+1} = (1 - k_d h) Y_n + \\sqrt{2k_b} \\Delta W_n$$\n\n**Part 4: Second Moment Recursion and Stability Analysis**\n\nTo derive the recursion for the second moment $M_n = \\mathbb{E}[Y_n^2]$, we square the EM update rule:\n$$Y_{n+1}^2 = \\left( (1 - k_d h) Y_n + \\sqrt{2k_b} \\Delta W_n \\right)^2$$\n$$Y_{n+1}^2 = (1 - k_d h)^2 Y_n^2 + 2(1 - k_d h)\\sqrt{2k_b} Y_n \\Delta W_n + 2k_b (\\Delta W_n)^2$$\nNow, we take the expectation of both sides. We use the properties of Itô calculus, specifically that future increments of the Wiener process are independent of the present state ($\\mathbb{E}[Y_n \\Delta W_n] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_n]\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta W_n] = 0$) and that the second moment of the increment is its variance ($\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_n)^2] = h$).\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y_{n+1}^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ (1 - k_d h)^2 Y_n^2 \\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[ 2(1 - k_d h)\\sqrt{2k_b} Y_n \\Delta W_n \\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[ 2k_b (\\Delta W_n)^2 \\right]$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y_{n+1}^2] = (1 - k_d h)^2 \\mathbb{E}[Y_n^2] + 2(1 - k_d h)\\sqrt{2k_b} \\mathbb{E}[Y_n]\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta W_n] + 2k_b \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_n)^2]$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta W_n] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_n)^2] = h$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y_{n+1}^2] = (1 - k_d h)^2 \\mathbb{E}[Y_n^2] + 2k_b h$$\nLetting $M_n = \\mathbb{E}[Y_n^2]$, we have the affine scalar recursion:\n$$M_{n+1} = (1 - k_d h)^2 M_n + 2k_b h$$\nThis is of the form $M_{n+1} = A M_n + B$, with amplification factor $A = (1 - k_d h)^2$ and offset $B = 2k_b h$.\nFor the sequence of second moments $\\{M_n\\}$ to be bounded for any finite initial moment $M_0$ (the condition for mean-square stability $\\sup_n M_n  \\infty$), the amplification factor $A$ must satisfy $|A|  1$.\nThe case $A=1$ leads to $M_{n+1} = M_n + B$, which means $M_n = M_0 + nB$. Since $B = 2k_b h > 0$, $M_n$ will grow linearly to infinity, violating the stability condition.\nTherefore, we require the strict inequality:\n$$| (1 - k_d h)^2 |  1$$\nSince a squared real number is non-negative, this is equivalent to:\n$$(1 - k_d h)^2  1$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$|1 - k_d h|  1$$\nThis inequality can be expanded to:\n$$-1  1 - k_d h  1$$\nWe analyze the two parts of the inequality separately:\n1. $1 - k_d h  1 \\implies -k_d h  0 \\implies k_d h > 0$.

Near extinction, the CLE predicts an extinction time distribution with a heavier right tail and larger mean extinction time than the CME; the primary source of discrepancy is the invalidity of the diffusion approximation at low copy number due to treating the last molecule as fractional, which reduces the effective hazard of the final death event compared to the discrete CME.\n\nC. Near extinction, the CLE predicts an extinction time distribution with a lighter right tail and smaller mean extinction time than the CME; the primary source of discrepancy is the use of independent Gaussian noises in the CLE that accelerate hitting the absorbing boundary.\n\nD.

Both CME and CLE produce identical exponential tails and therefore identical means for the extinction time; the only discrepancy is a negligible transient due to the initial condition that does not affect extinction statistics.", "solution": "We start from the exact Chemical Master Equation (CME) for the linear birth–death process. Let $P(n,t)$ denote the probability of having $n$ molecules at time $t$. The CME for $n \\ge 1$ is\n$$\n\\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} = k_b (n-1) P(n-1,t) + k_d (n+1) P(n+1,t) - \\big(k_b n + k_d n\\big) P(n,t),\n$$\nwith absorbing boundary $P(0,t)$ accumulating probability via inflow from $n=1$ at rate $k_d \\cdot 1 \\cdot P(1,t)$ and no outflow, i.e., $n=0$ is absorbing. For $k_b  k_d$, extinction occurs with probability one and the survival function $S(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T > t)$ decays asymptotically as an exponential with rate $k_d - k_b$; this follows from classical results on continuous-time subcritical branching processes where the survival probability decays like $\\mathrm{e}^{-(k_d - k_b) t}$ up to a prefactor depending on $n_0$. Importantly, the CME treats the state space as the nonnegative integers, and the final extinction event is a single death reaction from $n=1$ to $n=0$ with hazard $k_d$ that does not diminish below $k_d$ while $n=1$.\n\nThe Chemical Langevin Equation (CLE) is obtained by approximating the CME via the Kramers–Moyal expansion truncated at second order, yielding a Fokker–Planck equation with drift and diffusion coefficients derived from the leading jump moments. For our process, the drift is\n$$\nA(x) = (k_b - k_d)\\, x,\n$$\nand the diffusion coefficient (second Kramers–Moyal coefficient) is\n$$\nB(x) = (k_b + k_d)\\, x,\n$$\nleading to the stochastic differential equation\n$$\ndx = (k_b - k_d)\\, x\\, dt + \\sqrt{(k_b + k_d)\\, x}\\, dW_t,\n$$\nin an equivalent single-noise representation. This is the classical Feller branching diffusion. The CLE thereby treats the copy number as a continuous nonnegative state $x \\in [0,\\infty)$ with $x=0$ an absorbing boundary for the diffusion. While the CLE preserves the qualitative features of subcriticality (drift toward zero and vanishing noise amplitude as $x \\to 0$), it crucially relies on the assumption that copy numbers are sufficiently large that jumps of size one are small relative to state and that propensities vary slowly across such jumps. This assumption breaks down in the near-extinction regime, where $x$ is $O(1)$ or smaller.\n\nTo compare extinction time distributions, consider two aspects:\n\n1. Asymptotic tail behavior: Both the CME for a subcritical linear birth–death process and the CLE (Feller diffusion with negative linear drift) predict an exponential tail for the survival probability with decay rate on the order of $k_d - k_b$. Indeed, the branching diffusion is a diffusion limit of the birth–death process and inherits the same asymptotic rate of decay for survival.\n\n2. Near-boundary dynamics and mean extinction time: The discrepancy arises in how the two models treat the last molecules. In the CME, when $n=1$, the final death event occurs with a constant hazard $k_d$, which does not decrease further. In the CLE, states between $0$ and $1$ are allowed; the effective local noise amplitude and drift both scale with $x$, so as $x \\downarrow 0$ the dynamics slow, and the process can linger in a fractional-near-zero state. This “smearing” of the last molecule into a continuum reduces the instantaneous chance of absorption compared to the discrete jump from $n=1$ to $n=0$ at rate $k_d$. Equivalently, the diffusion approximation underestimates the hazard of extinction in the last-particle regime because the Kramers–Moyal truncation is invalid when the step size is comparable to the state and the absorbing boundary condition interacts with the vanishing diffusion coefficient. Consequently, the CLE tends to overestimate the mean extinction time and produces an extinction time distribution biased toward longer times compared to the CME when starting from small $n_0$.\n\nWith these principles, we assess each option:\n\nA. This claims exact agreement even when $n_0$ is $O(1)$. Although propensities are linear, the diffusion approximation requires large copy numbers to justify truncation of higher-order terms. Near extinction, the discrete absorbing state and one-molecule events are not captured exactly by the CLE. Therefore, this is Incorrect.\n\nB. This states that the CLE produces a heavier right tail and larger mean extinction time, attributing the discrepancy to the invalid diffusion approximation at low copy number and the treatment of the last molecule as fractional, which reduces the final-death hazard relative to the CME. This matches the analysis: near $x \\in (0,1)$, the CLE’s drift and diffusion both vanish, slowing absorption compared to the CME’s $n=1 \\to 0$ jump at rate $k_d$. Therefore, this is Correct.\n\nC. This asserts the opposite direction of discrepancy (lighter tail and smaller mean) and attributes it to independent Gaussian noises accelerating absorption. The proper one-dimensional CLE representation uses a single effective noise term with variance $(k_b + k_d) x$, and the vanishing of both drift and noise near zero slows, rather than accelerates, absorption compared to the discrete last-death event. Therefore, this is Incorrect.\n\nD. This claims bimodality induced by neglect of extrinsic noise. The comparison here concerns intrinsic noise models (CME vs CLE). There is no generic emergence of bimodality in the extinction time distribution from the CLE in this setting; both typically produce unimodal densities with exponential tails in the subcritical case. Therefore, this is Incorrect.\n\nE. This claims identical tails and therefore identical means, dismissing discrepancies as negligible transients. While asymptotic exponential rates can match, the mean is sensitive to the near-boundary dynamics because a nontrivial portion of probability mass is accumulated close to the absorbing state for small $n_0$. The CLE’s misrepresentation of the last-particle regime leads to a systematic bias in the mean extinction time. Therefore, this is Incorrect.\n\nThus, the most accurate statement is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3294891"}]}
