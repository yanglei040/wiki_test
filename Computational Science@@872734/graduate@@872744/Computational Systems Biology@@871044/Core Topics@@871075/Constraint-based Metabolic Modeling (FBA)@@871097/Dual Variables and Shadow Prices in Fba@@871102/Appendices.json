We use the notation requested, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the duals for the lower and upper bounds, respectively.\nThe constraints are:\n1.  Metabolite balance (equality): $S v = 0$.

We associate this with the dual variable vector $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}^{4}$.\n\nThe Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}(v, y, \\alpha, \\beta)$ for the maximization problem is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(v, y, \\alpha, \\beta) = c^{\\top} v - y^{\\top}(S v) - \\beta^{\\top}(v - u) - \\alpha^{\\top}(-v) $$\nWe can rearrange the terms by grouping the primal variable vector $v$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(v, y, \\alpha, \\beta) = (c^{\\top} - y^{\\top}S - \\beta^{\\top} + \\alpha^{\\top})v + \\beta^{\\top}u $$\nThe Lagrange dual function is the supremum of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $v$.

When this condition holds, the Lagrangian simplifies to $\\beta^{\\top}u$. The dual problem is to minimize this dual function subject to the dual feasibility constraints and the sign constraints on the dual variables.\n\n### 2) KKT Conditions and Interpretation\n\nThe KKT conditions provide necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality in a linear program. They are:\n1.  **Primal Feasibility:** $S v = 0$ and $0 \\le v \\le u$.\n2.  **Dual Feasibility:** $S^{\\top}y + \\beta - \\alpha = c$, with $\\alpha \\ge 0$ and $\\beta \\ge 0$.\n3.  **Complementary Slackness:** $\\alpha^{\\top}v = 0$ (component-wise, $\\alpha_i v_i = 0$) and $\\beta^{\\top}(v - u) = 0$ (component-wise, $\\beta_i (v_i - u_i) = 0$).\n\nWe are asked to argue that the primal optimum is $v^* = (5, 5, 0, 5)^{\\top}$.\nFirst, we check **primal feasibility**:\n-   $v_1=5, v_{2}^{+}=5, v_{2}^{-}=0, v_3=5$.\n-   Mass balance:\n    $S v^* = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  -1  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 - 5 + 0 \\\\ 5 - 0 - 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This holds.\n-   Box constraints:\n    -   $0 \\le v_1 = 5 \\le u_1=100$. Holds.\n    -   $0 \\le v_{2}^{+} = 5 \\le u_{2^{+}}=5$. Holds. $v_{2}^{+}$ is at its upper bound.\n    -   $0 \\le v_{2}^{-} = 0 \\le u_{2^{-}}=100$. Holds. $v_{2}^{-}$ is at its lower bound.\n    -   $0 \\le v_3 = 5 \\le u_3=100$. Holds.\nThe proposed flux distribution is primal feasible.\n\nNext, we apply **complementary slackness** to determine which dual variables must be zero at this optimum:\n-   From $\\alpha_i v_i = 0$:\n    -   $v_1 = 5 \\ne 0 \\implies \\alpha_1 = 0$.\n    -   $v_{2}^{+} = 5 \\ne 0 \\implies \\alpha_{2^{+}} = 0$. Thus, $\\alpha^{+} = 0$.\n    -   $v_{2}^{-} = 0$. $\\alpha_{2^{-}}$ can be non-zero. This is $\\alpha^{-}$.\n    -   $v_3 = 5 \\ne 0 \\implies \\alpha_3 = 0$.\n-   From $\\beta_i (v_i - u_i) = 0$:\n    -   $v_1 = 5 \\ne u_1=100 \\implies \\beta_1 = 0$.\n    -   $v_{2}^{+} = u_{2^{+}}=5$. $\\beta_{2^{+}}$ can be non-zero.\n    -   $v_{2}^{-} = 0 \\ne u_{2^{-}}=100 \\implies \\beta_{2^{-}} = 0$.\n    -   $v_3 = 5 \\ne u_3=100 \\implies \\beta_3 = 0$.\n\nNow, we use the **dual feasibility** equations, $S^{\\top}y + \\beta - \\alpha = c$. Let $y = (y_X, y_Y)^{\\top}$.\nThe component-wise equations are:\n1.  $v_1$: $y_X + \\beta_1 - \\alpha_1 = 0$. With $\\alpha_1=0, \\beta_1=0$, this gives $y_X = 0$.\n2.  $v_{2}^{+}$: $-y_X + y_Y + \\beta_{2^{+}} - \\alpha_{2^{+}} = 0$. With $y_X=0, \\alpha_{2^{+}}=0$, this simplifies to $y_Y + \\beta_{2^{+}} = 0$.\n3.  $v_{2}^{-}$: $y_X - y_Y + \\beta_{2^{-}} - \\alpha_{2^{-}} = 0$. With $y_X=0, \\beta_{2^{-}}=0$, this simplifies to $-y_Y - \\alpha_{2^{-}} = 0$, or $y_Y = -\\alpha_{2^{-}} = -\\alpha^{-}$.\n4.  $v_3$: $-y_Y + \\beta_3 - \\alpha_3 = 1$. With $\\alpha_3=0, \\beta_3=0$, this gives $-y_Y = 1$, so $y_Y = -1$.\n\nSolving this system: From (4), $y_Y = -1$. From (1), $y_X = 0$.\nSubstituting $y_Y=-1$ into (3): $-(-1) - \\alpha^{-} = 0 \\implies 1 = \\alpha^{-}$.\nSubstituting $y_Y=-1$ into (2): $-1 + \\beta_{2^{+}} = 0 \\implies \\beta_{2^{+}} = 1$.\nThe non-zero dual variables at the optimum are $\\alpha^{-} = \\alpha_{2^{-}} = 1$ and $\\beta_{2^{+}} = 1$. As both are non-negative, the dual feasibility check is complete. The KKT conditions are fully satisfied, confirming the optimality of $v^*$.\n\n**Interpretation of $\\alpha^{+}$ and $\\alpha^{-}$:**\nThe dual variables $\\alpha^{+} := \\alpha_{2^{+}}$ and $\\alpha^{-} := \\alpha_{2^{-}}$ are the shadow prices for the lower bounds ($v \\ge 0$) of the forward and reverse fluxes. The dual feasibility equations for these two fluxes are:\n$$ -y_X + y_Y + \\beta_{2^+} - \\alpha^+ = 0 $$\n$$ y_X - y_Y + \\beta_{2^-} - \\alpha^- = 0 $$\nLet the metabolic driving potential be defined as $\\Delta G_{\\text{dual}} = y_Y - y_X$. The equations become:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{dual}} = \\alpha^+ - \\beta_{2^+} $$\n$$ -\\Delta G_{\\text{dual}} = \\alpha^- - \\beta_{2^-} $$\nAt the optimum, $v_{2}^{+} > 0$ and is at its upper bound, while $v_{2}^{-} = 0$. Complementary slackness requires $\\alpha^{+} = 0$ and $\\beta_{2^{-}} = 0$.\nThe equations simplify to $\\Delta G_{\\text{dual}} = -\\beta_{2^+}$ and $-\\Delta G_{\\text{dual}} = \\alpha^{-}$. This implies $\\Delta G_{\\text{dual}} = -\\alpha^{-}$.\nAt our optimum, we found $y_X=0$ and $y_Y=-1$, so $\\Delta G_{\\text{dual}} = -1$. This gives $\\alpha^{-} = 1$ and $\\beta_{2^+} = 1$.\n-   A zero value for $\\alpha^{+}$ indicates there is no \"pressure\" from the constraint $v_{2}^{+} \\ge 0$, as the flux is strictly positive.\n-   A non-zero value for $\\alpha^{-} = 1$ indicates that the constraint $v_{2}^{-} \\ge 0$ is active and binding. The value $\\alpha^{-}=1$ quantifies the thermodynamic \"cost\" or pressure that prevents flux from flowing in the reverse direction ($Y \\to X$). A positive $\\alpha^{-}$ corresponds to a negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{dual}}$, which favors the forward reaction $X \\to Y$. The magnitude of $\\alpha^{-}$ reflects how strongly the reverse reaction is disfavored by the system's objective to maximize biomass production under the given constraints.\n\n### 3) Computation of the Shadow Price $\\alpha^{-}$\n\nAs determined in the KKT analysis above, the unique optimal values for the dual variables associated with the reversible pair are $\\alpha^{+} = \\alpha_{2^{+}} = 0$ and $\\alpha^{-} = \\alpha_{2^{-}} = 1$. The non-zero lower-bound shadow price for the reversible pair is therefore $\\alpha^{-}$. The calculation explicitly showed:\nFrom the fourth dual feasibility equation, $-y_Y=1 \\implies y_Y = -1$.\nFrom the third dual feasibility equation, $-y_Y - \\alpha^{-} = 0$.\nSubstituting $y_Y=-1$ gives $-(-1) - \\alpha^{-} = 0$, which yields $1 - \\alpha^{-} = 0$.\nThus, the unique optimal value for $\\alpha^{-}$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3303550"}]}
