Let $E(t)$, $S(t)$, $ES(t)$, and $P(t)$ denote the concentrations of each species as functions of time $t$.

System of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nApplying the Law of Mass Action to the reaction network, we can write the time-evolution equations for the concentrations of the species $E(t)$, $S(t)$, $ES(t)$, and $P(t)$. The rates of the individual reaction steps are:\n- Association $E+S\\to ES$: $v_1 = k_1 E(t) S(t)$\n- Dissociation $ES\\to E+S$: $v_{-1} = k_{-1} ES(t)$\n- Catalysis $ES\\to E+P$: $v_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} ES(t)$\n\nThe net rate of change for each species concentration is the sum of the rates of the reactions that produce it minus the sum of the rates of the reactions that consume it.\n\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -v_1 + v_{-1} + v_{\\mathrm{cat}} = -k_1 E(t)S(t) + (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -v_1 + v_{-1} = -k_1 E(t)S(t) + k_{-1}ES(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dES}{dt} = v_1 - v_{-1} - v_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_1 E(t)S(t) - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}ES(t) $$\n\nThe problem states the conservation of total enzyme, $E_{\\mathrm{tot}} = E(t) + ES(t)$. Differentiating this with respect to time $t$ yields $\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{dt} = \\frac{dE}{dt} + \\frac{dES}{dt}$. Summing the derived ODEs for $E$ and $ES$ confirms this: $\\frac{dE}{dt} + \\frac{dES}{dt} = [-k_1 E S + (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES] + [k_1 E S - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES] = 0$.\n\n**2. Dimensional Analysis**\n\nLet $[X]$ denote the physical dimensions of a quantity $X$. Concentrations are given in units of moles per liter, which we denote dimensionally as $C = \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Time is in seconds, denoted as $T = \\mathrm{s}$. The dimension of a rate of change of concentration is $C/T$.\n\n- From the term $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}ES(t)$ in the equation for $dP/dt$, we have $[k_{\\mathrm{cat}}][ES] = C/T$. Since $[ES] = C$, it follows that $[k_{\\mathrm{cat}}] = T^{-1}$.\n- Similarly, from the term $k_{-1}ES(t)$ in the equation for $dS/dt$, we have $[k_{-1}][ES] = C/T$, which gives $[k_{-1}] = T^{-1}$.\n- From the term $k_1 E(t)S(t)$ in the equation for $dS/dt$, we have $[k_1][E][S] = C/T$. Since $[E] = [S] = C$, we have $[k_1]C^2 = C/T$, which gives $[k_1] = C^{-1}T^{-1}$.\n- The Michaelis constant is defined as $K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}$. Its dimensions are $[K_M] = \\frac{[k_{-1}] + [k_{\\mathrm{cat}}]}{[k_1]}$. Since $k_{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ have the same dimensions $T^{-1}$, their sum also has dimensions $T^{-1}$. Thus, $[K_M] = \\frac{T^{-1}}{C^{-1}T^{-1}} = C$.\n\nThe units are therefore:\n- $k_1$: $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{-1}$: $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$: $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $K_M$: $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n\nThe dimensional consistency is verified as every term in each ODE has dimensions of $C/T$.\n\n**3. Nondimensionalization**\n\nWe introduce the dimensionless variables and characteristic scales as defined in the problem:\n- Time: $\\tau = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} t \\implies t = \\tau / k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$\n- Substrate concentration: $\\sigma(\\tau) = S(t)/K_M \\implies S(t) = K_M \\sigma(\\tau)$\n- Enzyme complex concentration: $c(\\tau) = ES(t)/E_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\implies ES(t) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}c(\\tau)$\n- Free enzyme concentration: $e(\\tau) = E(t)/E_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\implies E(t) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}e(\\tau)$\n\nThe enzyme conservation law $E(t) + ES(t) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ becomes $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}e(\\tau) + E_{\\mathrm{tot}}c(\\tau) = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, which simplifies to the dimensionless form $e(\\tau) + c(\\tau) = 1$.\n\n**4. Derivation of the Dimensionless Rate under QSSA**\n\nTo derive the normalized rate $v^*(\\sigma)$, we first nondimensionalize the ODE for the enzyme-substrate complex, $ES$.\n$$ \\frac{dES}{dt} = k_1 E(t)S(t) - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES(t) $$\nSubstitute the definitions of the dimensionless variables:\n$$ \\frac{d(E_{\\mathrm{tot}}c)}{d(\\tau/k_{\\mathrm{cat}})} = k_1 (E_{\\mathrm{tot}}e)(K_M\\sigma) - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})(E_{\\mathrm{tot}}c) $$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d\\tau}{dt}\\frac{d}{d\\tau} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\frac{d}{d\\tau}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{tot}}k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = k_1 E_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_M e \\sigma - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) E_{\\mathrm{tot}} c $$\nDivide by $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_1 K_M}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} e \\sigma - \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} c $$\nSubstitute $e = 1 - c$ and the definition $K_M = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})/k_1$. The term $\\frac{k_1 K_M}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\frac{k_{-1}+k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}$.\n$$ \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} (1-c) \\sigma - \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} c $$\n$$ \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\left[ (1-c)\\sigma - c \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\left[ \\sigma - c(\\sigma+1) \\right] $$\nThe quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) is valid when the concentration of the intermediate complex $ES$ changes on a much faster time scale than the substrate $S$. This condition, given as $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}/(K_M+S_0) \\ll 1$, allows us to set the time derivative of the fast variable to zero. In dimensional terms, $\\frac{dES}{dt} \\approx 0$. In dimensionless terms, this corresponds to $\\frac{dc}{d\\tau} \\approx 0$.\nApplying the QSSA to the dimensionless equation for $c$:\n$$ 0 \\approx \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\left[ \\sigma - c_{qss}(\\sigma+1) \\right] $$\nwhere $c_{qss}$ is the quasi-steady-state value of $c$. Since the pre-factor is non-zero, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$ \\sigma - c_{qss}(\\sigma+1) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sigma = c_{qss}(\\sigma+1) $$\nSolving for $c_{qss}$ gives the dimensionless complex concentration as a function of the dimensionless substrate concentration:\n$$ c_{qss}(\\sigma) = \\frac{\\sigma}{1+\\sigma} $$\nThe product formation rate is $v = dP/dt = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}ES(t)$. The problem asks for the dimensionless normalized rate $v^{*}(\\sigma) = v/(k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_{\\mathrm{tot}})$.\n$$ v^{*} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}ES(t)}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}E_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{ES(t)}{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}} $$\nBy definition, $c = ES(t)/E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. Therefore, $v^{*} = c$.\nUnder the QSSA, the rate is determined by the quasi-steady-state complex concentration:\n$$ v^{*}(\\sigma) = c_{qss}(\\sigma) = \\frac{\\sigma}{1+\\sigma} $$\nThis is the normalized Michaelis-Menten equation in dimensionless form.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\sigma}{1+\\sigma}} $$", "id": "3302218"}, {"introduction": "Moving from catalysis to reversible binding, this problem challenges you to use nondimensionalization as an analytical tool to scrutinize a common experimental assumption.

No contradictions are found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid, scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. I will proceed with the full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe kinetics of the system are governed by the law of mass action. We can write the rate of change for the complex concentration, $C(t)$, as:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} L(t) R(t) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} C(t)\n$$\nUsing the conservation laws, $L(t) = L_0 - C(t)$ and $R(t) = R_0 - C(t)$, we can express the dynamics using a single ODE for $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} (L_0 - C(t))(R_0 - C(t)) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} C(t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies scaling concentrations by $K_D$. Let's define the dimensionless concentrations:\n$$\nc(\\tau) = \\frac{C(t)}{K_D}, \\quad l(\\tau) = \\frac{L(t)}{K_D}, \\quad r(\\tau) = \\frac{R(t)}{K_D}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is a dimensionless time to be determined. We also define dimensionless initial concentrations:\n$$\nl_0 = \\frac{L_0}{K_D}, \\quad r_0 = \\frac{R_0}{K_D}\n$$\nSubstituting $C(t) = c(\\tau) K_D$ into the ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d(c K_D)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} (l_0 K_D - c K_D)(r_0 K_D - c K_D) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} (c K_D)\n$$\n$$\nK_D \\frac{dc}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D^2 (l_0 - c)(r_0 - c) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} K_D c\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by $K_D$:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D (l_0 - c)(r_0 - c) - k_{\\mathrm{off}} c\n$$\nUsing the definition $K_D = k_{\\mathrm{off}}/k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, we can write $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D (l_0 - c)(r_0 - c) - (k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D) c\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = (k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D) \\left[ (l_0 - c)(r_0 - c) - c \\right]\n$$\nThis form reveals a natural time scale. The term $(k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D)$ has units of inverse time. We define dimensionless time $\\tau$ such that $d\\tau = (k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D) dt$. This gives $\\tau = (k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D) t$. Note that since $k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D = k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, the time scale is also simply $k_{\\mathrm{off}}t$. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{dc}{dt} = \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{dc}{d\\tau} (k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D)$. Substituting this into the equation yields the final dimensionless ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{d\\tau} = (l_0 - c)(r_0 - c) - c\n$$\nwith initial condition $c(0) = C(0)/K_D = 0/K_D = 0$. The dynamics are fully determined by two independent dimensionless parameters: $l_0 = L_0/K_D$ and $r_0 = R_0/K_D$.\n\nNext, we analyze the pseudo-first-order approximation. This approximation assumes that the ligand concentration $L(t)$ remains approximately constant and equal to its initial value, $L_0$, throughout the reaction. This is justified if the amount of ligand consumed by binding is negligible compared to the total amount of ligand.\n\nThe amount of ligand consumed at time $t$ is equal to the concentration of complex formed, $C(t)$. The fractional change in ligand concentration is $\\frac{L_0 - L(t)}{L_0} = \\frac{C(t)}{L_0}$. For the approximation $L(t) \\approx L_0$ to be valid, this fractional change must be small for all time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{L_0} \\ll 1\n$$\nFrom the conservation law $R(t) + C(t) = R_0$, and noting that $R(t) \\ge 0$, we have an upper bound on the amount of complex that can ever be formed: $C(t) \\le R_0$. Therefore, the maximum possible fractional change in ligand concentration is bounded by $R_0/L_0$.\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{L_0} \\le \\frac{R_0}{L_0}\n$$\nThe pseudo-first-order approximation is thus asymptotically valid if the upper bound on the fractional depletion is small, i.e.,\n$$\n\\frac{R_0}{L_0} \\ll 1\n$$\nThis ratio, $\\delta = R_0/L_0$, is the ligand depletion parameter. The approximation is valid when $\\delta \\to 0$ and fails when $\\delta$ becomes significant (e.g., $\\delta \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$ or larger), as this implies that a substantial fraction of the ligand pool can be consumed by binding to receptors. This condition is a ratio of initial concentrations and is independent of the value of $K_D$.\n\nThe system can be described by the two parameters $l_0 = L_0/K_D$ and $\\delta = R_0/L_0$, as these are independent and determine the third parameter $r_0 = R_0/K_D = (R_0/L_0)(L_0/K_D) = \\delta l_0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. After scaling concentrations by $K_D$ and time by $(k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D)^{-1}$, the dynamics depend only on two independent dimensionless parameters $l_0 = L_0/K_D$ and $\\delta = R_0/L_0$. The ligand depletion parameter $\\delta$ emerges naturally from conservation, and the pseudo-first-order approximation is asymptotically valid for $\\delta \\to 0$ at fixed $l_0$, but fails when $\\delta$ is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ or larger, regardless of $K_D$.**\n- **Time scaling:** The time scale $(k_{\\mathrm{on}} K_D)^{-1}$ matches our derivation.\n- **Dimensionless parameters:** The set $\\{l_0, \\delta\\}$ correctly and independently specifies the system's dimensionless dynamics.\n- **Depletion parameter:** $\\delta = R_0/L_0$ is correctly identified as the parameter governing ligand depletion.\n- **Validity condition:** The condition for validity is correctly stated as $\\delta \\to 0$ (or $\\delta \\ll 1$) and the condition for failure as $\\delta$ being of order $1$ or larger.\n- **Independence of $K_D$:** The validity *criterion* ($\\delta \\ll 1$) is a ratio of initial concentrations and does not depend on $K_D$, which is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. After scaling, the only relevant parameter is $K_D$; pseudo-first-order kinetics fail whenever $K_D \\ll L_0$ independently of $R_0$, because strong binding alone invalidates the constant-ligand assumption.**\n- **Parameters:** $K_D$ is a dimensional constant used for scaling; it is not a dimensionless parameter of the scaled system. The dynamics depend on the dimensionless groups $l_0$ and $r_0$. This is incorrect.\n- **Failure condition:** The condition $K_D \\ll L_0$ (i.e., $l_0 \\gg 1$) does not guarantee failure of the approximation. If $R_0 \\ll L_0$ simultaneously, the approximation remains valid because the receptor pool is too small to deplete the large ligand pool, regardless of how tightly the ligand binds. The validity is critically dependent on $R_0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The correct dimensionless parameters are $r_0 = R_0/K_D$ and $\\delta = R_0/L_0$, and pseudo-first-order kinetics are valid only if both $\\delta \\ll 1$ and $l_0 = L_0/K_D \\gg 1$; if $l_0 \\ll 1$, the approximation necessarily fails even when $\\delta \\ll 1$.**\n- **Parameters:** The set $\\{r_0, \\delta\\}$ is a valid choice of independent parameters.\n- **Validity condition:** It incorrectly adds the requirement $l_0 \\gg 1$. The fundamental condition for the approximation $L(t) \\approx L_0$ is that the maximum consumed ligand, bounded by $R_0$, is a small fraction of the total ligand, $L_0$. This is purely the condition $\\delta = R_0/L_0 \\ll 1$. The value of $l_0$ (i.e., the ligand concentration relative to $K_D$) does not affect the validity of the approximation itself, although it does affect the extent and speed of the reaction. The claim that the approximation *necessarily fails* if $l_0 \\ll 1$ is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The depletion parameter appears as $\\delta^{-1} = L_0/R_0$; the pseudo-first-order approximation is valid for $\\delta \\gg 1$ and fails for $\\delta \\ll 1$, because large receptor relative to ligand keeps $L(t)$ effectively constant.**\n- **Validity condition:** This option has the logic reversed. It states the approximation is valid for $\\delta \\gg 1$, which means $R_0/L_0 \\gg 1$ (large excess of receptor). In this regime, the ligand is the limiting reactant and is expected to be almost fully depleted, representing the maximal failure of the $L(t) \\approx L_0$ approximation.\n- **Reasoning:** The reasoning provided is also false: \"large receptor relative to ligand keeps $L(t)$ effectively constant\". A large excess of receptor causes significant depletion of ligand. A large excess of *ligand* relative to receptor is what keeps $L(t)$ constant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3302288"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice escalates the complexity from a single reaction to a small genetic network—the famous toggle switch, a building block of synthetic biology.

Avoid using any shortcut formulas not derived from these definitions.\n- Implement an algorithm to determine the number of linearly stable steady states for given physical parameter sets by: (i) computing the dimensionless parameter groups from the physical parameters, (ii) finding all nonnegative steady states of the dimensionless system, and (iii) assessing linear stability via the Jacobian matrix eigenvalues at each steady state. Two eigenvalues with negative real parts indicate linear stability. Express the number of linearly stable steady states for each test case as an integer.\n- Units: The given physical parameters must be treated with their units as stated. The final outputs are unitless integers and require no unit conversion. No angles or percentages appear in this task.\n- Test suite: Use the following five test cases, each provided as $(\\alpha_x,\\alpha_y,K_x,K_y,\\gamma_x,\\gamma_y,m,n)$ with $\\alpha_x$ and $\\alpha_y$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{min}$, $K_x$ and $K_y$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $\\gamma_x$ and $\\gamma_y$ in $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, and $m$ and $n$ unitless:\n  1. Case A (symmetric, cooperative, high production): $(\\alpha_x,\\alpha_y,K_x,K_y,\\gamma_x,\\gamma_y,m,n) = (10,10,1,1,1,1,2,2)$.\n  2. Case B (symmetric, cooperative, low production): $(\\alpha_x,\\alpha_y,K_x,K_y,\\gamma_x,\\gamma_y,m,n) = (0.5,0.5,1,1,1,1,2,2)$.\n  3. Case C (asymmetric production, cooperative): $(\\alpha_x,\\alpha_y,K_x,K_y,\\gamma_x,\\gamma_y,m,n) = (10,1,1,1,1,1,2,2)$.\n  4. Case D (symmetric, noncooperative, high production): $(\\alpha_x,\\alpha_y,K_x,K_y,\\gamma_x,\\gamma_y,m,n) = (10,10,1,1,1,1,1,1)$.\n  5.

For this two-dimensional system, this is equivalent to the trace being negative and the determinant being positive; however, we will compute eigenvalues numerically for robustness.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each physical parameter set:\n1. Compute the dimensionless groups $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\Delta$, $m$, $n$ from $(\\alpha_x,\\alpha_y,K_x,K_y,\\gamma_x,\\gamma_y,m,n)$ via $A_1 = \\alpha_x/(\\gamma_x K_x)$, $A_2 = \\alpha_y/(\\gamma_x K_y)$, and $\\Delta = \\gamma_y/\\gamma_x$.\n2. Find all nonnegative steady states by solving $f_1(\\bar{x},\\bar{y})=0$, $f_2(\\bar{x},\\bar{y})=0$ using multiple initial guesses over a grid in a bounded domain informed by the nullcline bounds $\\bar{x} \\le A_1$, $\\bar{y} \\le A_2/\\Delta$ (the maximums attained when the denominator terms $1+\\bar{y}^n$ and $1+\\bar{x}^m$ are minimized).\n3. Cluster the numerical solutions to remove duplicates using a small tolerance, and discard nonphysical solutions with negative components.\n4. For each steady state, evaluate $J$ and compute its eigenvalues. Count a steady state as linearly stable if both eigenvalues have negative real parts (within a small numerical tolerance).\n5. Report the integer count of linearly stable steady states for each test case.\n\nInterpretation of dimensionless groups and bistability:\n- Larger $A_1$ and $A_2$ increase the ability of each gene to maintain expression despite repression, making the nullclines extend to larger values and increasing the chance of multiple intersections (leading to two stable fixed points and one unstable).\n- Hill exponents $m>1$ and $n>1$ introduce sigmoidal repression curves, which are essential for generating multiple intersections; $m=n=1$ typically yields monostability.\n- The degradation ratio $\\Delta$ skews the relative response times and steady-state levels; deviations from $\\Delta=1$ deform the nullclines and can either promote or suppress bistability depending on balance with $A_1$ and $A_2$.\n\nThe test suite spans: a symmetric, cooperative, high-production case (expected bistability); a symmetric, cooperative, low-production case (expected monostability); an asymmetric production case; a noncooperative case; and a case with unequal degradation rates. The program will compute, for each case, the number of linearly stable steady states.
