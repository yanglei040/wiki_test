It is a standard exercise in computational systems biology involving the construction and analysis of a stoichiometric matrix. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent with the principles of chemical reaction network theory. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system consists of $m=4$ species, which, according to the specified ordering $(A,B,C,D)$, can be represented by a concentration vector $\\mathbf{x} = ([A], [B], [C], [D])^{\\top}$. There are $r=3$ reactions, ordered as $(R_1, R_2, R_3)$.\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$ is constructed such that its $(i,j)$ entry, $S_{ij}$, represents the net change in the number of molecules of species $i$ due to one instance of reaction $j$. Each column of $S$ is the stoichiometric vector for the corresponding reaction.\n\nFor Reaction $R_1: 2A + B \\to C$:\nThe change in species counts is $\\Delta A = -2$, $\\Delta B = -1$, $\\Delta C = +1$, and $\\Delta D = 0$. The first column of $S$, corresponding to $R_1$, is thus:\n$$ \\mathbf{s}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFor Reaction $R_2: C \\to A + D$:\nThe change in species counts is $\\Delta A = +1$, $\\Delta B = 0$, $\\Delta C = -1$, and $\\Delta D = +1$. The second column of $S$, corresponding to $R_2$, is:\n$$ \\mathbf{s}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFor Reaction $R_3: D \\to B$:\nThe change in species counts is $\\Delta A = 0$, $\\Delta B = +1$, $\\Delta C = 0$, and $\\Delta D = -1$. The third column of $S$, corresponding to $R_3$, is:\n$$ \\mathbf{s}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nCombining these column vectors in the specified order $(R_1, R_2, R_3)$ yields the $4 \\times 3$ stoichiometric matrix $S$:\n$$ S = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{s}_1 & \\mathbf{s}_2 & \\mathbf{s}_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we determine the rank of $S$ and the dimensions of its kernel and the kernel of its transpose. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of its column space, which is equal to the number of linearly independent columns. The columns $\\mathbf{s}_1, \\mathbf{s}_2, \\mathbf{s}_3$ are linearly independent if the only solution to the equation $c_1\\mathbf{s}_1 + c_2\\mathbf{s}_2 + c_3\\mathbf{s}_3 = \\mathbf{0}$ is the trivial solution $c_1=c_2=c_3=0$. This is equivalent to finding the kernel (null space) of $S$.\nThe equation $S\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, c_3)^{\\top}$, corresponds to the system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n-2c_1 + c_2 &= 0 \\\\\n-c_1 + c_3 &= 0 \\\\\nc_1 - c_2 &= 0 \\\\\nc_2 - c_3 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nFrom the third equation, we have $c_1 = c_2$. Substituting this into the first equation gives $-2c_1 + c_1 = 0$, which implies $-c_1 = 0$, so $c_1 = 0$.\nSince $c_1=c_2$, we have $c_2 = 0$.\nFrom the second equation, $c_3 = c_1$, so $c_3 = 0$.\nThe only solution is $c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0$. This demonstrates that the columns of $S$ are linearly independent.\nSince there are $3$ linearly independent columns, the dimension of the column space is $3$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{rank}(S) = 3$.\n\nThe kernel of $S$, denoted $\\ker S$, is the set of all vectors $\\mathbf{c}$ such that $S\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{0}$. We have just shown that the only such vector is the zero vector, $\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{0}$. The kernel is the trivial subspace $\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$, and its dimension is $0$.\nThus, $\\dim(\\ker S) = 0$.\nThis result is also consistent with the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which states that for a matrix with $r$ columns, $\\operatorname{rank}(S) + \\dim(\\ker S) = r$. Here, $r=3$, and we found $\\operatorname{rank}(S)=3$, so $3 + \\dim(\\ker S) = 3$, which confirms $\\dim(\\ker S) = 0$.\n\nFinally, we determine $\\dim(\\ker S^{\\top})$. The matrix $S^{\\top}$ is an $r \\times m$ matrix, which is a $3 \\times 4$ matrix in this case. The Rank-Nullity Theorem applied to $S^{\\top}$ states that $\\operatorname{rank}(S^{\\top}) + \\dim(\\ker S^{\\top}) = m$, where $m$ is the number of columns of $S^{\\top}$ (which is the number of rows of $S$).\nA fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that the rank of a matrix is equal to the rank of its transpose, i.e., $\\operatorname{rank}(S) = \\operatorname{rank}(S^{\\top})$.\nWe have $m=4$ and $\\operatorname{rank}(S) = 3$, so $\\operatorname{rank}(S^{\\top}) = 3$.\nSubstituting these values into the Rank-Nullity Theorem for $S^{\\top}$:\n$$ 3 + \\dim(\\ker S^{\\top}) = 4 $$\nSolving for $\\dim(\\ker S^{\\top})$, we find:\n$$ \\dim(\\ker S^{\\top}) = 1 $$\nThe vectors in $\\ker S^{\\top}$ represent the conservation laws of the system. The fact that its dimension is $1$ implies there is one linearly independent conservation law.\n\nIn summary, the calculated values are:\n$\\operatorname{rank}(S) = 3$\n$\\dim(\\ker S) = 0$\n$\\dim(\\ker S^{\\top}) = 1$\n\nThe final answer should be presented as a row matrix in the order $(\\operatorname{rank}(S), \\dim(\\ker S), \\dim(\\ker S^{\\top}))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3291006"}, {"introduction": "While the stoichiometric matrix $S$ is a cornerstone of network analysis, its structure can be further dissected to provide deeper insights, forming the basis of Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT).

A complex is a formal linear combination of species that appears as a reactant or product in at least one reaction. A linkage class is a connected component of the undirected graph whose vertices are complexes, with an undirected edge between two complexes if there is at least one reaction between them (in either direction). The stoichiometric subspace is the linear subspace spanned by the stoichiometric change vectors of the reactions. The deficiency is the nonnegative integer determined by the numbers of complexes, linkage classes, and the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace. A network is weakly reversible if every connected component of the directed reaction graph on complexes is strongly connected. The Deficiency Zero Theorem in chemical reaction network theory requires that the network has deficiency zero and is weakly reversible.\n\nStep $1$: Identify complexes. The reactions are $A \\to B$, $B \\to A$, and $2B \\to A + B$. The complexes that appear are $A$, $B$, $2B$, and $A + B$. Therefore, the set of complexes is $\\{A, B, 2B, A + B\\}$, and the number of complexes is $n = 4$.\n\nStep $2$: Determine linkage classes. Form the undirected graph on the $n = 4$ complexes with edges if a reaction connects them in either direction. There is an undirected edge between $A$ and $B$ because both $A \\to B$ and $B \\to A$ exist. There is an undirected edge between $2B$ and $A + B$ because of the reaction $2B \\to A + B$. There are no reactions connecting $\\{A, B\\}$ to $\\{2B, A + B\\}$, hence no edges between these pairs across the sets. Thus, the undirected graph has two connected components, namely $\\{A, B\\}$ and $\\{2B, A + B\\}$. Therefore, the number of linkage classes is $\\ell = 2$.\n\nStep $3$: Construct stoichiometric change vectors and compute the stoichiometric subspace dimension. Let the species order be $(A, B)$. For each reaction, the stoichiometric change vector is product complex minus reactant complex, interpreted componentwise in $(A, B)$.\n\n- For $A \\to B$, the reactant complex corresponds to $(1, 0)$ and the product complex to $(0, 1)$, so the change vector is $(0, 1) - (1, 0) = (-1, 1)$.\n- For $B \\to A$, the change vector is $(1, 0) - (0, 1) = (1, -1)$.\n- For $2B \\to A + B$, the reactant complex corresponds to $(0, 2)$ and the product complex to $(1, 1)$, so the change vector is $(1, 1) - (0, 2) = (1, -1)$.\n\nThe set of change vectors is $\\{(-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, -1)\\}$. All these vectors lie in the span of $(1, -1)$, because $(-1, 1) = - (1, -1)$. Hence, the stoichiometric subspace is one-dimensional, and its dimension is $s = 1$.\n\nStep $4$: Compute the deficiency $\\delta$. By definition, the deficiency is determined by the number of complexes, the number of linkage classes, and the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace. Using $n = 4$, $\\ell = 2$, and $s = 1$, we obtain\n$$\\delta \\;=\\; n - \\ell - s \\;=\\; 4 - 2 - 1 \\;=\\; 1.$$\n\nStep $5$: Determine weak reversibility. A network is weakly reversible if in the directed reaction graph on complexes, every linkage class is strongly connected. Consider the two linkage classes:\n\n- The first linkage class $\\{A, B\\}$ has directed edges $A \\to B$ and $B \\to A$. This class is strongly connected.\n- The second linkage class $\\{2B, A + B\\}$ has the directed edge $2B \\to A + B$ and no reaction from $A + B$ to $2B$. Therefore, there is no directed path from $A + B$ back to $2B$, so this class is not strongly connected.\n\nBecause at least one linkage class is not strongly connected, the network is not weakly reversible. Therefore, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{WR}} = 0$.\n\nStep $6$: Deduce whether the conditions of the Deficiency Zero Theorem are satisfied. The Deficiency Zero Theorem requires that the network be weakly reversible and have deficiency zero. Here, $\\delta = 1 \\neq 0$, and the network is not weakly reversible. Therefore, the conditions are not satisfied, and $\\chi_{\\mathrm{DZ}} = 0$.\n\nStep $7$: Compute the encoded integer $C$. Using the encoding\n$$C \\;=\\; \\delta \\;+\\; 2\\,\\chi_{\\mathrm{WR}} \\;+\\; 4\\,\\chi_{\\mathrm{DZ}},$$\nwe substitute $\\delta = 1$, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{WR}} = 0$, and $\\chi_{\\mathrm{DZ}} = 0$ to obtain\n$$C \\;=\\; 1 \\;+\\; 2 \\cdot 0 \\;+\\; 4 \\cdot 0 \\;=\\; 1.$$\n\nThus, the required single numerical output is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3291054"}]}
