{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding cellular excitability begins with analyzing the core feedback loops that govern ion dynamics. This exercise guides you through the analysis of a minimal model for Calcium-Induced Calcium Release (CICR), the fundamental mechanism behind many calcium signals. By deriving the system's nullclines and investigating the stability of its resting state, you will learn to classify its excitability and predict how changes in cellular parameters, such as pump strength, can lead to the onset of oscillations via distinct bifurcation pathways ([@problem_id:3292803]).", "problem": "Consider a minimal two-variable model of Calcium-Induced Calcium Release (CICR) describing cytosolic calcium concentration and channel inactivation, derived from mass balance and first-order gating kinetics. Let $c$ denote cytosolic free calcium (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and $h$ denote the fraction of available (non-inactivated) channel gates (dimensionless). The system is\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} \\;=\\; J_{\\mathrm{chan}}(c,h)\\;-\\;J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(c)\\;+\\;J_{\\mathrm{leak}}(c),\n\\qquad\n\\frac{dh}{dt} \\;=\\; \\frac{h_{\\infty}(c) - h}{\\tau_h},\n$$\nwhere $J_{\\mathrm{chan}}$ is the calcium release flux through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) channels, $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$ is the plasma membrane/ER pump uptake, and $J_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ is the passive leak from ER. Assume a fixed ER calcium content that sets a constant driving force. The model components are specified as follows:\n- Activation and inactivation steady states are Hill functions:\n$$\nm_{\\infty}(c) \\;=\\; \\frac{c^{n_m}}{K_m^{n_m} + c^{n_m}},\\qquad\nh_{\\infty}(c) \\;=\\; \\frac{K_h^{n_h}}{K_h^{n_h} + c^{n_h}}.\n$$\n- Channel release, leak, and pump fluxes are\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{chan}}(c,h) \\;=\\; v_1\\,m_{\\infty}(c)^3\\,h^3\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c),\\quad\nJ_{\\mathrm{leak}}(c) \\;=\\; v_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c),\\quad\nJ_{\\mathrm{pump}}(c) \\;=\\; v_p\\,\\frac{c^{p_p}}{K_p^{p_p} + c^{p_p}}.\n$$\nHere $c_{\\mathrm{ER}}$ is the fixed ER calcium level (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), $v_1$ and $v_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ are rate constants (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), $v_p$ is the pump strength (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{s}$), $K_m$, $K_h$, and $K_p$ are half-saturation constants (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), $n_m$, $n_h$, and $p_p$ are Hill exponents (dimensionless), and $\\tau_h$ is the inactivation time constant (in $\\mathrm{s}$). All times must be expressed in seconds, all concentrations in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and rates in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{s}$ or $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ as indicated.\n\nTask 1 (derivation): Starting from the definitions above and basic mass balance and first-order kinetics, derive the two nullclines as explicit relations in terms of $c$ and $h$:\n- The $h$-nullcline defined by $\\dot h = 0$.\n- The $c$-nullcline defined by $\\dot c = 0$, explicitly isolating $h$ as a function of $c$ whenever the right-hand side permits.\n\nTask 2 (local stability and excitability classification): Using the Jacobian linearization at equilibria $(c^\\ast,h^\\ast)$, derive the general Jacobian entries in terms of the partial derivatives of $J_{\\mathrm{chan}}$, $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$, and $J_{\\mathrm{leak}}$, and the derivatives of $h_{\\infty}$. Express the trace and determinant of the Jacobian at equilibrium in terms of $c^\\ast$ and $h^\\ast$, and state the local criteria for a Hopf bifurcation and for a saddle-node collision (saddle-node on an invariant circle, SNIC, onset). For a Hopf transition, also specify how to estimate the small-amplitude oscillation angular frequency at onset from the Jacobian.\n\nTask 3 (computational prediction as pump strength varies): Implement a program that, for each parameter set in the test suite below, varies the pump strength $v_p$ from a high value down to a low value and predicts the first bifurcation that terminates the stable resting state when scanning $v_p$ downward. Your program must:\n- Compute equilibria by solving $\\dot c = 0$ with $h = h_{\\infty}(c)$, i.e., solve\n$$\nF(c;v_p) \\;=\\; v_1\\,m_{\\infty}(c)^3\\,h_{\\infty}(c)^3\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)\\;+\\; v_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)\\;-\\;v_p\\,\\frac{c^{p_p}}{K_p^{p_p} + c^{p_p}} \\;=\\; 0,\n$$\nfor $c$ in the biologically relevant interval $[0,2]$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$).

A stable node/focus requires negative trace and positive determinant.\n- Detect the first loss of the stable resting state as $v_p$ decreases:\n    - Hopf onset: the rest equilibrium persists but its trace crosses zero with positive determinant and complex conjugate eigenvalues. Report the critical $v_p$ where the trace changes sign first (rounded as specified below). Estimate the oscillation angular frequency at onset as $\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}} = \\sqrt{\\det(J)}$ (in $\\mathrm{rad}/\\mathrm{s}$) evaluated at the Hopf point.\n    - SNIC onset: the resting equilibrium disappears in a saddle-node collision, detected when the resting equilibrium ceases to exist as $v_p$ decreases; refine to the boundary where it vanishes and report that $v_p$ as the critical value. Report the onset angular frequency as $0$ (in $\\mathrm{rad}/\\mathrm{s}$).\n    - If neither event occurs in the scanned interval, report no transition.\n- Numerical details: use robust one-dimensional bracketing to find all roots of $F(c;v_p)$ over $[0,2]$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) and pick the smallest root as specified. Use finite or analytic derivatives to evaluate the Jacobian. Use bisection or secant refinement over $v_p$ to locate the event values to within absolute tolerance $10^{-4}$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{s}$ for $v_p$).\n\nTest suite (three parameter sets):\n- Case A (expectation: fast inactivation favors Hopf-like onset):\n    - $c_{\\mathrm{ER}} = 400$, $v_1 = 0.01$, $v_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 10^{-5}$, $K_m = 0.3$, $n_m = 2$, $K_h = 0.2$, $n_h = 4$, $K_p = 0.3$, $p_p = 2$, $\\tau_h = 0.3$, scan $v_p \\in [0.2, 0.005]$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{s}$).\n- Case B (expectation: slow inactivation and stronger channel favor SNIC-like onset):\n    - $c_{\\mathrm{ER}} = 400$, $v_1 = 0.02$, $v_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 10^{-5}$, $K_m = 0.3$, $n_m = 2$, $K_h = 0.2$, $n_h = 4$, $K_p = 0.3$, $p_p = 2$, $\\tau_h = 8.0$, scan $v_p \\in [0.2, 0.005]$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{s}$).\n- Case C (expectation: weak channel prevents oscillations over the scan range):\n    - $c_{\\mathrm{ER}} = 400$, $v_1 = 0.003$, $v_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 10^{-5}$, $K_m = 0.3$, $n_m = 2$, $K_h = 0.2$, $n_h = 4$, $K_p = 0.3$, $p_p = 2$, $\\tau_h = 3.0$, scan $v_p \\in [0.2, 0.005]$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{s}$).\n\nRequired outputs and units:\n- For each case, output a list of three values: $[v_p^{\\ast}, \\mathrm{code}, \\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}}]$ where $v_p^{\\ast}$ is the predicted critical pump strength (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{s}$), $\\mathrm{code}$ is an integer classification with $1$ for Hopf, $2$ for SNIC, and $0$ for no transition found, and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}}$ is the angular frequency at onset (in $\\mathrm{rad}/\\mathrm{s}$; use $0$ for SNIC and $-1$ if no transition).\n- Numerical formatting: express $v_p^{\\ast}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}}$ as decimal floats rounded to four decimal places. If no transition is found, use $-1.0000$ for $v_p^{\\ast}$ and $-1.0000$ for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}}$.\n- Final output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of the three per-case lists, enclosed in square brackets. For example: \"[[0.0412,1,0.5938],[0.0287,2,0.0000],[-1.0000,0,-1.0000]]\".\n\nScientific realism constraints:\n- Ensure all intermediate computations preserve $h \\in [0,1]$ and $c \\in [0,2]$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) when constructing nullclines and equilibria.\n- Use only physically consistent operations and parameter combinations as defined above.", "solution": "The user has provided a problem in computational systems biology concerning the dynamics of a minimal model for Calcium-Induced Calcium Release (CICR).

It is scientifically grounded in established modeling principles for cellular calcium dynamics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is objective and formalizable. The tasks are coherent and build upon one another, from theoretical derivation to computational implementation, which is a standard workflow in this field.\n\nHerein, I provide a complete, reasoned solution to all three tasks.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of Nullclines\n\nThe dynamical system is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = v_1\\,m_{\\infty}(c)^3\\,h^3\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c) + v_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c) - v_p\\,\\frac{c^{p_p}}{K_p^{p_p} + c^{p_p}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{h_{\\infty}(c) - h}{\\tau_h}\n$$\n\nNullclines are curves in the $(c, h)$ phase plane where one of the time derivatives is zero.\n\n**The h-nullcline ($\\dot{h} = 0$)**:\nThe condition $\\frac{dh}{dt} = 0$ is set.\n$$\n\\frac{h_{\\infty}(c) - h}{\\tau_h} = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nh = h_{\\infty}(c)\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $h_{\\infty}(c)$:\n$$\nh = \\frac{K_h^{n_h}}{K_h^{n_h} + c^{n_h}}\n$$\nThis equation defines the $h$-nullcline. It is a monotonically decreasing function of $c$, starting from $h=1$ at $c=0$ and approaching $h=0$ for large $c$.\n\n**The c-nullcline ($\\dot{c} = 0$)**:\nThe condition $\\frac{dc}{dt} = 0$ is set.\n$$\nv_1\\,m_{\\infty}(c)^3\\,h^3\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c) + v_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c) - v_p\\,\\frac{c^{p_p}}{K_p^{p_p} + c^{p_p}} = 0\n$$\nWe rearrange this equation to express $h$ as a function of $c$:\n$$\nv_1\\,m_{\\infty}(c)^3\\,h^3\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c) = v_p\\,\\frac{c^{p_p}}{K_p^{p_p} + c^{p_p}} - v_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)\n$$\nSolving for $h^3$:\n$$\nh^3 = \\frac{v_p\\,\\frac{c^{p_p}}{K_p^{p_p} + c^{p_p}} - v_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)}{v_1\\,m_{\\infty}(c)^3\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)}\n$$\nTaking the cube root gives the explicit form for the $c$-nullcline:\n$$\nh(c) = \\left( \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(c) - J_{\\mathrm{leak}}(c)}{J_{\\mathrm{chan}}(c,h)/h^3} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{v_p\\,\\frac{c^{p_p}}{K_p^{p_p} + c^{p_p}} - v_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)}{v_1\\,\\left(\\frac{c^{n_m}}{K_m^{n_m} + c^{n_m}}\\right)^3\\,(c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis relation is defined for values of $c$ where the argument of the cube root is real and the denominator is non-zero. For the specified parameters ($c_{\\mathrm{ER}=400}$) and domain ($c \\in [0,2]$), $c_{\\mathrm{ER}}-c > 0$. The term $m_{\\infty}(c)$ is zero only at $c=0$, so the denominator is non-zero for $c0$. The existence of a real-valued $h$ depends on the numerator being non-negative.\n\n### Task 2: Local Stability and Bifurcation Analysis\n\nLet the system be $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})$ with $\\mathbf{x} = [c, h]^T$.\nThe right-hand side functions are $f(c,h) = \\dot{c}$ and $g(c,h) = \\dot{h}$. The Jacobian matrix at an equilibrium point $(c^\\ast, h^\\ast)$ is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial h} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial h} \\end{pmatrix}_{(c^\\ast, h^\\ast)}\n$$\n\n**Jacobian Entries**:\nThe partial derivatives are:\n- $J_{11} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} [J_{\\mathrm{chan}}(c,h) + J_{\\mathrm{leak}}(c) - J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(c)]$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} = v_1 h^3 \\left(3 m_{\\infty}^2 \\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dc}(c_{\\mathrm{ER}}-c) - m_{\\infty}^3\\right) - v_{\\mathrm{leak}} - \\frac{d J_{\\mathrm{pump}}}{dc}\n$$\n- $J_{12} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial h} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h} [v_1 m_{\\infty}^3 h^3 (c_{\\mathrm{ER}}-c)] = 3 v_1 m_{\\infty}^3 h^2 (c_{\\mathrm{ER}}-c)$\n- $J_{21} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\left[\\frac{h_{\\infty}(c) - h}{\\tau_h}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\tau_h} \\frac{dh_{\\infty}}{dc}$\n- $J_{22} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial h} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h} \\left[\\frac{h_{\\infty}(c) - h}{\\tau_h}\\right] = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_h}$\n\nThe required derivatives of the component functions are:\n$\\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dc} = \\frac{n_m K_m^{n_m} c^{n_m-1}}{(K_m^{n_m} + c^{n_m})^2}$, $\\frac{dh_{\\infty}}{dc} = \\frac{-n_h K_h^{n_h} c^{n_h-1}}{(K_h^{n_h} + c^{n_h})^2}$, and $\\frac{dJ_{\\mathrm{pump}}}{dc} = v_p \\frac{p_p K_p^{p_p} c^{p_p-1}}{(K_p^{p_p} + c^{p_p})^2}$.\nAll these derivatives are evaluated at the equilibrium $(c^\\ast, h^\\ast)$, where $h^\\ast = h_{\\infty}(c^\\ast)$.\n\n**Trace and Determinant**:\nThe trace of the Jacobian is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = J_{11} + J_{22} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}\\bigg|_{(c^\\ast, h^\\ast)} - \\frac{1}{\\tau_h}\n$$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(J) = J_{11} J_{22} - J_{12} J_{21} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_h}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}\\bigg|_{(c^\\ast, h^\\ast)} - \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial h}\\bigg|_{(c^\\ast, h^\\ast)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_h} \\frac{dh_{\\infty}}{dc}\\bigg|_{c^\\ast}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_h} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial h} \\frac{dh_{\\infty}}{dc} \\right)\\bigg|_{(c^\\ast, h^\\ast)}\n$$\nAs derived in the thought process, the term in parentheses is the total derivative of the equilibrium function $F(c; v_p)$ with respect to $c$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Det}(J) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_h} \\frac{dF}{dc}\\big|_{c^\\ast}$.\n\n**Bifurcation Criteria**:\nA fixed point is locally stable if $\\mathrm{Tr}(J)  0$ and $\\mathrm{Det}(J)  0$. Bifurcations occur when one of these conditions is violated.\n- **Hopf Bifurcation**: Occurs when a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis. The condition is $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = 0$ and $\\mathrm{Det}(J)  0$. At the bifurcation point, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, $\\lambda = \\pm i\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}}$. The characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - \\mathrm{Tr}(J)\\lambda + \\mathrm{Det}(J) = 0$ becomes $\\lambda^2 + \\mathrm{Det}(J) = 0$. This gives the angular frequency of the nascent oscillations as:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Det}(J)}\n$$\n- **Saddle-Node (SNIC) Bifurcation**: Occurs when a stable node and a saddle point collide and annihilate. This happens when an eigenvalue passes through zero. The condition is $\\mathrm{Det}(J) = 0$. Since $\\mathrm{Det}(J) \\propto dF/dc$, this corresponds to a fold in the curve of fixed points, where $F(c^\\ast)=0$ and $dF/dc|_{c^\\ast}=0$. At this point, the oscillation frequency is zero, so $\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}} = 0$.\n\n### Task 3: Computational Prediction\n\nThe computational strategy involves a numerical search for the critical value of the pump strength parameter, $v_p$, at which the stable resting state first loses stability as $v_p$ is decreased. The type of bifurcation (Hopf or SNIC) is determined by the mechanism of stability loss.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  **Define Model and Parameters**: For each test case, all model functions, their derivatives, and parameters are defined.\n2.  **Find Equilibria**: A robust root-finding procedure is implemented to locate all solutions to $F(c;v_p) = 0$ within the interval $c \\in [0, 2]\\, \\mu\\mathrm{M}$. This is achieved by dividing the interval into smaller segments and using a numerical root-finder (`brentq`) within any segment where a sign change of $F(c; v_p)$ is detected. The smallest positive root is identified as the resting state, $c^\\ast$.\n3.  **Assess Stability**: For a given $c^\\ast$, the corresponding $h^\\ast = h_{\\infty}(c^\\ast)$ is calculated. The Jacobian matrix is evaluated at $(c^\\ast, h^\\ast)$, and its trace and determinant are computed. The state is stable if and only if $\\mathrm{Tr}(J)  0$ and $\\mathrm{Det}(J)  0$.\n4.  **Bifurcation Search**: A bisection search is performed on the parameter $v_p$ over its specified scan range. The search aims to find the critical value $v_p^\\ast$ that marks the boundary between the region where a stable resting state exists and where it does not. The bisection iteratively narrows down the interval $[v_{p,low}, v_{p,high}]$, where $v_{p,high}$ corresponds to a stable state and $v_{p,low}$ does not. The result, $v_p^\\ast$, is the lowest value of $v_p$ for which a stable equilibrium is found.\n5.  **Classify Bifurcation**: To classify the bifurcation at $v_p^\\ast$, the system is examined at a slightly lower value, $v_p^\\ast - \\epsilon$.\n    -   If no equilibrium root can be found at this lower value, it signifies that the resting state has disappeared. This corresponds to a **SNIC bifurcation** (Code 2), and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}}$ is set to $0$.\n    -   If an equilibrium root still exists but is now unstable, the stability loss is due to the trace crossing zero. This corresponds to a **Hopf bifurcation** (Code 1). The onset angular frequency is calculated as $\\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}} = \\sqrt{\\det(J)}$ evaluated at $v_p^\\ast$.\n6.  **Handle No Transition**: If a stable resting state exists across the entire scanned range of $v_p$, no bifurcation is detected (Code 0), and dummy values are reported as per the instructions.\n7.  **Format Output**: The results for each case—$[v_p^\\ast, \\mathrm{code}, \\omega_{\\mathrm{onset}}]$—are formatted to four decimal places and compiled into a final list of lists.\n\nThis methodology provides a robust and theoretically sound approach to solving the posed computational problem.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\nimport warnings\n\n# Suppress runtime warnings that may occur with extreme values in Hill functions\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=RuntimeWarning)\n\n# --- Parameter sets from the problem ---\nPARAMS_SUITE = {\n    'A': {'name': 'A', 'c_ER': 400.0, 'v1': 0.01, 'v_leak': 1e-5, 'K_m': 0.3, 'n_m': 2.0, 'K_h': 0.2, 'n_h': 4.0, 'K_p': 0.3, 'p_p': 2.0, 'tau_h': 0.3, 'vp_range': [0.005, 0.2]},\n    'B': {'name': 'B', 'c_ER': 400.0, 'v1': 0.02, 'v_leak': 1e-5, 'K_m': 0.3, 'n_m': 2.0, 'K_h': 0.2, 'n_h': 4.0, 'K_p': 0.3, 'p_p': 2.0, 'tau_h': 8.0, 'vp_range': [0.005, 0.2]},\n    'C': {'name': 'C', 'c_ER': 400.0, 'v1': 0.003, 'v_leak': 1e-5, 'K_m': 0.3, 'n_m': 2.0, 'K_h': 0.2, 'n_h': 4.0, 'K_p': 0.3, 'p_p': 2.0, 'tau_h': 3.0, 'vp_range': [0.005, 0.2]}\n}\n\n# --- Model component functions ---\ndef m_inf(c, p):\n    c_safe = max(c, 1e-9)\n    return c_safe**p['n_m'] / (p['K_m']**p['n_m'] + c_safe**p['n_m'])\n\ndef h_inf(c, p):\n    c_safe = max(c, 1e-9)\n    return p['K_h']**p['n_h'] / (p['K_h']**p['n_h'] + c_safe**p['n_h'])\n\ndef J_pump_norm(c, p):\n    c_safe = max(c, 1e-9)\n    return c_safe**p['p_p'] / (p['K_p']**p['p_p'] + c_safe**p['p_p'])\n\ndef F(c, vp, p):\n    if c  0: return np.inf\n    J_chan_val = p['v1'] * m_inf(c, p)**3 * h_inf(c, p)**3 * (p['c_ER'] -

The rest state $(c_0, h_0)$ is a steady, spatially homogeneous solution, found by setting all derivatives to zero in the original system. This requires $f(c_0, h_0) = 0$ and $g(c_0, h_0) = 0$.\nThe condition $g(c_0, h_0) = h_{\\infty}(c_0) - h_0 = 0$ implies $h_0 = h_{\\infty}(c_0)$, where $h_{\\infty}(c) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{c}{K_{h}}\\right)^{n}}$.\nThe condition $f(c_0, h_0) = J_{\\mathrm{rel}}(c_0, h_0) - J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(c_0) = 0$ then becomes:\n$$\nv_{r}\\,h_{\\infty}(c_0)\\,c_0\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{c_0}{c_{s}}\\right) - k_{p}\\,c_0 = 0\n$$\nFactoring out $c_0$ yields:\n$$\nc_0 \\left[ v_{r}\\,h_{\\infty}(c_0)\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{c_0}{c_{s}}\\right) - k_{p} \\right] = 0\n$$\nOne obvious fixed point is $c_0 = 0$.

The wave profile must satisfy the boundary condition $c(\\xi) \\to 0$ as $\\xi \\to +\\infty$ (far ahead of the wave).\n\nThe problem directs us to analyze the leading edge of the wave using an eikonal-type approximation. In the leading edge, the calcium concentration $c$ is just beginning to rise from $0$. The problem also states the assumption that the slow inhibitor variable $h$ remains close to its rest value, $h \\approx h_0 = 1$. This approximation is valid because $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, meaning $h$ evolves much more slowly than $c$.\n\nWe linearize the reaction term $f(c,h)$ around the rest state $(c,h) = (0,1)$. The full expression is $f(c,h) = v_{r}\\,h\\,c\\left(1 - \\frac{c}{c_{s}}\\right) - k_{p}\\,c$.

Substituting this into the ODE yields the characteristic equation for the spatial decay rate $\\lambda$:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\lambda^2 + v\\lambda + (v_{r} - k_{p}) = 0\n$$\nThe roots are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2 - 4 D_{\\mathrm{eff}} (v_r - k_p)}}{2 D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nFor a wave to propagate into the rest state, the state must be excitable. This requires that a small increase in $c$ leads to further net production of $c$ (when $h$ is fixed at its rest value). This corresponds to the minimal condition for wave propagation: the coefficient of the linear term in $c$ must be positive, i.e., $v_r - k_p  0$.\n\nThe boundary condition $c(\\xi) \\to 0$ as $\\xi \\to +\\infty$ requires the real part of $\\lambda$ to be negative. For a monotonic front profile, the roots $\\lambda$ must be real and negative. The eikonal approximation, equivalent to the marginal stability criterion for pulled fronts of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) type, postulates that the physically realized wave speed is the minimum speed for which a valid solution exists.
