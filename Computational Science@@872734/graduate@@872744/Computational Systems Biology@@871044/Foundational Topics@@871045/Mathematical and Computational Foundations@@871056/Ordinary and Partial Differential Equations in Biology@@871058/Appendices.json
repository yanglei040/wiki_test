It is a classic example of a singular perturbation problem in the context of reaction-diffusion systems, which is a core topic in computational systems biology. We can proceed with a solution using the method of matched asymptotic expansions.\n\nThe provided steady-state reaction-diffusion equation is:\n$$D u''(x) + f(u(x)) = 0, \\quad x \\in (0, 1)$$\nwith the reaction term $f(u) = u - u^3$ and boundary conditions $u(0) = 4/5$ and $u(1) = 1$. The parameter $D$ is small, $0 < D \\ll 1$.\n\nThe equation can be interpreted as a steady-state mass balance. Let $J(x) = -D u'(x)$ be the diffusive flux (Fick's law). The equation becomes $\\frac{dJ}{dx} = -f(u)$, which states that the spatial change in flux is balanced by the local reaction rate.\n\n**Step 1: Outer Solution**\nIn the outer region, away from any boundary layers, we assume the solution $u(x)$ varies slowly. The term $D u''(x)$ is thus negligible compared to the reaction term $f(u(x))$. We find the leading-order outer solution, $u_{out}(x)$, by setting $D=0$ in the original equation:\n$$f(u_{out}(x)) = 0$$\n$$u_{out} - u_{out}^3 = 0 \\implies u_{out}(1 - u_{out}^2) = 0$$\nThis algebraic equation has three constant solutions: $u_{out} = -1$, $u_{out} = 0$, and $u_{out} = 1$. Since $u(x)$ represents a protein concentration, it must be non-negative, so we only consider $u_{out}=0$ and $u_{out}=1$.\n\nFor a reaction-diffusion system, the outer solution must correspond to a stable steady state of the reaction kinetics, described by the ODE $\\frac{du}{dt} = f(u)$. The stability is determined by the sign of $f'(u) = 1 - 3u^2$.\n- For $u=0$, $f'(0) = 1 > 0$, so this state is unstable.\n- For $u=1$, $f'(1) = 1-3 = -2 < 0$, so this state is stable.\nAny small perturbation would cause the solution to move away from the unstable state $u=0$. Therefore, the only valid leading-order outer solution is $u_{out}(x) = 1$.\n\nWe check this outer solution against the boundary conditions:\n- At $x=1$, $u_{out}(1)=1$, which matches the boundary condition $u(1)=1$.\n- At $x=0$, $u_{out}(0)=1$, which does not match the boundary condition $u(0)=4/5$.\n\nThis discrepancy signifies the presence of a boundary layer at $x=0$, where the solution changes rapidly to satisfy the boundary condition. No boundary layer is needed at $x=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Inner Solution and Boundary Layer Analysis**\nTo analyze the boundary layer at $x=0$, we introduce a stretched inner coordinate $X = \\frac{x}{\\delta(D)}$, where $\\delta(D)$ is the characteristic thickness of the layer. Let the inner solution be $u_{in}(X) \\equiv u(x)$. The derivatives transform as:\n$$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{du_{in}}{dX}, \\qquad \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\delta^2} \\frac{d^2u_{in}}{dX^2}$$\nSubstituting into the ODE gives:\n$$\\frac{D}{\\delta^2} \\frac{d^2u_{in}}{dX^2} + u_{in} - u_{in}^3 = 0$$\nTo obtain a distinguished limit where the diffusive and reaction terms balance, we must set the coefficient of the highest derivative to be of order one. We choose $\\frac{D}{\\delta^2} = 1$, which implies $\\delta = \\sqrt{D}$.\nThus, the boundary layer has a characteristic thickness of order $O(\\sqrt{D})$, and the inner coordinate is $X = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{D}}$. The leading-order inner equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2u_{in}}{dX^2} + u_{in} - u_{in}^3 = 0$$\nThe inner solution must satisfy the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$u_{in}(X=0) = u(0) = \\frac{4}{5}$$\nIt must also match the outer solution as the inner variable goes to infinity. The matching condition is:\n$$\\lim_{X \\to \\infty} u_{in}(X) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} u_{out}(x) = 1$$\nTo solve the second-order inner ODE, we multiply by $\\frac{du_{in}}{dX}$ and integrate with respect to $X$:\n$$\\int \\frac{du_{in}}{dX}\\frac{d^2u_{in}}{dX^2} dX + \\int (u_{in} - u_{in}^3)\\frac{du_{in}}{dX} dX = C_1$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{du_{in}}{dX}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}u_{in}^2 - \\frac{1}{4}u_{in}^4 = C_1$$\nWe use the matching condition at infinity to find the constant $C_1$. As $X \\to \\infty$, $u_{in} \\to 1$ and its derivative $\\frac{du_{in}}{dX} \\to 0$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(1)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}(1)^4 = C_1 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{du_{in}}{dX}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}u_{in}^2 + \\frac{1}{4}u_{in}^4 = \\frac{1}{4}(1 - 2u_{in}^2 + u_{in}^4) = \\frac{1}{4}(1 - u_{in}^2)^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{du_{in}}{dX}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - u_{in}^2)^2 \\implies \\frac{du_{in}}{dX} = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1 - u_{in}^2)$$\nSince $u_{in}(0) = 4/5$ and $u_{in}$ must increase to approach $1$ as $X \\to \\infty$, the derivative $\\frac{du_{in}}{dX}$ must be positive. For $u_{in}$ in the range $[4/5, 1)$, the term $1 - u_{in}^2$ is positive.

It presents a standard task in the numerical analysis of partial differential equations, specifically within computational systems biology where reaction-diffusion models are prevalent. The parameters and definitions are complete and consistent.\n\n### 1. Derivation and Consistency of the IMEX Scheme\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is the reaction-diffusion equation $\\partial_t u = D \\Delta u + f(u)$. We are tasked with discretizing this equation on a one-dimensional periodic domain of length $L$ with a uniform grid of $N$ nodes, where the grid spacing is $h=L/N$.\n\nThe spatial part of the PDE is discretized using a second-order central difference for the Laplacian, resulting in the semi-discrete system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{d u_i}{d t} = D (\\Delta_h u)_i + f(u_i) \\quad \\text{for } i=0, \\dots, N-1,\n$$\nwhere $u_i(t) \\approx u(x_i, t)$ and $(\\Delta_h u)_i = (u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1})/h^2$. In vector form, this is $\\frac{d\\vec{u}}{dt} = D \\Delta_h \\vec{u} + \\vec{f}(\\vec{u})$, where $\\vec{u} = (u_0, \\dots, u_{N-1})^T$ and $\\vec{f}(\\vec{u}) = (f(u_0), \\dots, f(u_{N-1}))^T$.\n\nThe desired implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme treats the stiff linear diffusion term ($D \\Delta_h \\vec{u}$) implicitly and the potentially nonlinear reaction term ($\\vec{f}(\\vec{u})$) explicitly. This corresponds to using the backward Euler method for the diffusion term and the forward Euler method for the reaction term. Applying this to the semi-discrete system from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}=t_n+\\Delta t$, we approximate the time derivative as $(\\vec{u}^{n+1} - \\vec{u}^n)/\\Delta t$, evaluate the implicit term at the future time level $n+1$, and the explicit term at the current time level $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\vec{u}^{n+1} - \\vec{u}^n}{\\Delta t} = D \\Delta_h \\vec{u}^{n+1} + \\vec{f}(\\vec{u}^n).\n$$\nThis constitutes a mass balance where the rate of change is set equal to the sum of a diffusive flux evaluated implicitly and a reaction source term evaluated explicitly. Rearranging the equation to group the unknown terms $\\vec{u}^{n+1}$ on the left-hand side yields:\n$$\n\\vec{u}^{n+1} - \\Delta t D \\Delta_h \\vec{u}^{n+1} = \\vec{u}^n + \\Delta t \\vec{f}(\\vec{u}^n).\n$$\nFactoring out $\\vec{u}^{n+1}$ using the identity operator $I$, we obtain the required matrix form of the update rule:\n$$\n\\left(I - \\Delta t D \\Delta_h\\right) \\vec{u}^{n+1} = \\vec{u}^n + \\Delta t \\vec{f}(\\vec{u}^n).\n$$\n\nTo demonstrate consistency, we analyze the local truncation error, $\\tau^n_i$, by substituting the exact solution $u(x_i, t_n)$ into the finite difference equation:\n$$\n\\frac{u(x_i, t_{n+1}) - u(x_i, t_n)}{\\Delta t} = D \\Delta_h u(x_i, t_{n+1}) + f(u(x_i, t_n)).\n$$\nUsing Taylor expansions around $(x_i, t_n)$ for a sufficiently smooth solution $u$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $u(x_i, t_{n+1}) = u(x_i, t_n) + \\Delta t \\partial_t u + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2} \\partial_{tt} u + O((\\Delta t)^3)$.\n    \\item The left-hand side becomes: $\\partial_t u + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\partial_{tt} u + O((\\Delta t)^2)$.\n    \\item For the right-hand side, the discrete Laplacian is a second-order approximation to the continuous one: $\\Delta_h \\phi(x_i) = \\partial_{xx} \\phi(x_i) + O(h^2)$.\n    \\item Thus, $D \\Delta_h u(x_i, t_{n+1}) = D (\\partial_{xx} u(x_i, t_{n+1}) + O(h^2)) = D (\\partial_{xx} u(x_i, t_n) + \\Delta t \\partial_{xx}\\partial_t u + O((\\Delta t)^2) + O(h^2))$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe truncation error is the difference between the discretized PDE and the exact PDE, $\\partial_t u - D \\partial_{xx} u - f(u) = 0$. After substituting the expansions, we find:\n$$\n\\tau_i^n = \\left(\\partial_t u + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\partial_{tt} u \\right) - D\\left(\\partial_{xx} u + \\Delta t \\partial_{xx}\\partial_t u\\right) - f(u) + O((\\Delta t)^2) + O(D h^2).\n$$\nGrouping terms:\n$$\n\\tau_i^n = (\\partial_t u - D \\partial_{xx} u - f(u)) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\partial_{tt} u - D \\Delta t \\partial_{xx}\\partial_t u + O((\\Delta t)^2, h^2).\n$$\nThe first parenthesis is zero. The remaining error is $\\tau_i^n = O(\\Delta t) + O(h^2)$. As $\\Delta t \\to 0$ and $h \\to 0$, the truncation error vanishes. Therefore, the scheme is consistent, with first-order accuracy in time and second-order accuracy in space.\n\n### 2. Linear Stability Analysis\n\nWe analyze the stability of the scheme around a spatially homogeneous steady state $u^\\star$, where $f(u^\\star) = 0$. Let $\\vec{u}^n = \\vec{u}^\\star + \\delta\\vec{u}^n$, where $\\vec{u}^\\star$ is a vector with all components equal to $u^\\star$ and $\\delta\\vec{u}^n$ is a small perturbation. The reaction term is linearized as $f(u_i^n) \\approx f(u^\\star) + f'(u^\\star)\\delta u_i^n = r \\delta u_i^n$. Substituting into the scheme:\n$$\n(I - \\Delta t D \\Delta_h) (\\vec{u}^\\star + \\delta\\vec{u}^{n+1}) = (\\vec{u}^\\star + \\delta\\vec{u}^n) + \\Delta t \\vec{f}(\\vec{u}^\\star + \\delta\\vec{u}^n).\n$$\nUsing the linearization and noting that $\\Delta_h \\vec{u}^\\star = \\vec{0}$ because $\\vec{u}^\\star$ is constant:\n$$\n\\vec{u}^\\star + (I - \\Delta t D \\Delta_h) \\delta\\vec{u}^{n+1} = \\vec{u}^\\star + \\delta\\vec{u}^n + \\Delta t r \\delta\\vec{u}^n.\n$$\nThe steady state $\\vec{u}^\\star$ cancels, yielding the evolution equation for the perturbation:\n$$\n(I - \\Delta t D \\Delta_h) \\delta\\vec{u}^{n+1} = (1 + r \\Delta t) \\delta\\vec{u}^n.\n$$\nTo perform a von Neumann stability analysis, we decompose the perturbation $\\delta\\vec{u}^n$ into the discrete Fourier modes $\\vec{\\varphi}_k$, which are the eigenvectors of the circulant matrix $\\Delta_h$. Let $\\delta\\vec{u}^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\hat{u}_k^n \\vec{\\varphi}_k$. Since $\\Delta_h \\vec{\\varphi}_k = \\lambda_k \\vec{\\varphi}_k$, substituting the expansion into the perturbation equation and exploiting linearity allows us to analyze each mode independently:\n$$\n(1 - \\Delta t D \\lambda_k) \\hat{u}_k^{n+1} \\vec{\\varphi}_k = (1 + r \\Delta t) \\hat{u}_k^n \\vec{\\varphi}_k.\n$$\nThe amplification factor for mode $k$ is $G_k(\\Delta t) = \\hat{u}_k^{n+1}/\\hat{u}_k^n$, given by:\n$$\nG_k(\\Delta t) = \\frac{1 + r \\Delta t}{1 - \\Delta t D \\lambda_k}.\n$$\nFor linear stability, we require the magnitude of the amplification factor to be no greater than $1$ for all modes, i.e., $\\max_{k} |G_k(\\Delta t)| \\le 1$. The eigenvalues are given as $\\lambda_k = -\\frac{4}{h^2}\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi k}{N})$, which are real and non-positive ($\\lambda_k \\le 0$). Since $D>0$ and $\\Delta t>0$, the denominator $1 - \\Delta t D \\lambda_k$ is always real and greater than or equal to $1$. The modulus of the amplification factor is:\n$$\n|G_k(\\Delta t)| = \\frac{|1 + r \\Delta t|}{1 - \\Delta t D \\lambda_k}.\n$$\nThe numerator is independent of the mode index $k$. To maximize $|G_k(\\Delta t)|$, we must minimize the denominator $1 - \\Delta t D \\lambda_k$. This occurs when $\\lambda_k$ is maximal (least negative), which corresponds to the mode $k=0$, for which $\\lambda_0 = 0$. Thus, the worst-case (largest) amplification factor is:\n$$\n\\max_{k} |G_k(\\Delta t)| = |G_0(\\Delta t)| = \\frac{|1 + r \\Delta t|}{1 - 0} = |1 + r \\Delta t|.\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the stability of this IMEX scheme is governed solely by the explicit treatment of the reaction term, independent of the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the spatial discretization $h$. The stability condition simplifies to $|1 + r \\Delta t| \\le 1$. This is equivalent to the inequality $-1 \\le 1 + r \\Delta t \\le 1$, which simplifies to $-2 \\le r \\Delta t \\le 0$.\n\nWe now determine the maximum stable time step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ based on the sign of $r = f'(u^\\star)$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Case $r > 0$ (unstable reaction): Since $\\Delta t > 0$, $r \\Delta t > 0$. The condition $r \\Delta t \\le 0$ can only hold if $\\Delta t = 0$. The scheme is unconditionally unstable for any $\\Delta t > 0$. Thus, $\\Delta t_{\\max} = 0$.\n    \\item Case $r = 0$ (neutrally stable reaction): The condition becomes $-2 \\le 0 \\le 0$, which is always true. The scheme is unconditionally stable. Thus, $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\infty$.\n    \\item Case $r  0$ (stable reaction): Since $r$ is negative, $r \\Delta t \\le 0$ is always true for $\\Delta t \\ge 0$. The remaining condition is $-2 \\le r \\Delta t$. Dividing by the negative value $r$ reverses the inequality: $\\Delta t \\le -2/r$. Thus, the maximum stable time step is $\\Delta t_{\\max} = -2/r$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n### 3. Implementation and Testable Outputs\n\nThe implementation computes $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ using the derived formulas. It then assesses the stability for two given time steps, $\\Delta t_1$ and $\\Delta t_2$, by checking if the maximum amplification factor, $|G_0(\\Delta t_j)| = |1 + r \\Delta t_j|$, is less than or equal to $1$. The parameters $L$, $N$, and $D$ do not influence the linear stability of this specific IMEX scheme, as shown by the analysis where the worst-case amplification factor simplified to be independent of $\\lambda_k$. The program calculates $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ and the two boolean stability/instability indicators for each test case as specified.", "answer": "```\n[[0.2,True,True],[0.2,True,True],[0.0,False,True],[0.26666666666666666,True,True],[20.0,True,True]]\n```", "id": "3335951"}]}
