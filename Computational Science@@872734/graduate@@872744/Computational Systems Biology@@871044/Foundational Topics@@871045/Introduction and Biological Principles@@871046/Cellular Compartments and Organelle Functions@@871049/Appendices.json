The volumes of the compartments are $V_1$ and $V_2$. The membrane separating them has an area $A$ and a permeability $P$ to the metabolite.\n\nThe analysis begins with Fick's first law of diffusion as applied to transport across a thin membrane. The flux $J(t)$, defined as the amount of solute crossing a unit area of the membrane per unit time, is proportional to the concentration difference. We define the net flux from compartment $1$ to compartment $2$:\n$$ J(t) = P [c_1(t) - c_2(t)] $$\nThe total rate of transport of the solute (e.g., in moles per second) from compartment $1$ to compartment $2$, denoted by $\\Phi(t)$, is the flux $J(t)$ multiplied by the total area of the membrane $A$:\n$$ \\Phi(t) = J(t) \\cdot A = P A [c_1(t) - c_2(t)] $$\nNext, we apply the principle of conservation of mass.
