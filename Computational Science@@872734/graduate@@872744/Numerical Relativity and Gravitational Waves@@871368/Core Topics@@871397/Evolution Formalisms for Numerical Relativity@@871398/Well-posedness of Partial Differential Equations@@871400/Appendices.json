It is scientifically grounded in the principles of general relativity and partial differential equations, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All givens are consistent and relevant to the study of the well-posedness of numerical relativity formulations.\n\nThe problem asks for the spectral radius of the characteristic speeds of the linearized generalized harmonic (GH) system. The starting point, as guided by the problem statement, is the fact that the principal part of the GH formulation is a set of quasilinear wave equations for each component of the metric $g_{ab}$.\n\nUpon linearization around a Minkowski background, $g_{ab} = \\eta_{ab} + \\varepsilon \\psi_{ab}$, the principal part of the vacuum Einstein equations in the GH formulation becomes a set of uncoupled linear wave equations for the metric perturbation $\\psi_{ab}$:\n$$ \\eta^{cd} \\partial_c \\partial_d \\psi_{ab} = 0 $$\nHere, $\\eta^{cd}$ is the inverse Minkowski metric. In the specified $3+1$ splitting with lapse $\\alpha=1$ and shift $\\beta^i=0$, the coordinates are Minkowskian, so $\\eta^{cd} = \\text{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)$. The wave equation for each component of $\\psi_{ab}$ is:\n$$ -\\partial_t^2 \\psi_{ab} + \\delta^{ij} \\partial_i \\partial_j \\psi_{ab} = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\partial_t^2 \\psi_{ab} = \\delta^{ij} \\partial_i \\partial_j \\psi_{ab} $$\nThe gauge source function $H_a = \\kappa n_a$ and the constraint damping parameter $\\gamma_0$ are specified as constants and independent of the dynamical fields. In the linearization, these terms affect the source terms or lower-order derivatives of the evolution equations, but they do not alter the principal part, which consists of the second-order derivatives. Therefore, they do not affect the characteristic speeds of the system.\n\nTo analyze the characteristic speeds, we convert this second-order system into a first-order system using the variables provided:\n1.  The metric perturbation, $\\psi_{ab}$.\n2.  $\\Pi_{ab} := -n^c \\partial_c \\psi_{ab} = -\\partial_t \\psi_{ab}$ (since $n^c$ is aligned with $\\partial_t$).\n3.  $\\Phi_{iab} := \\partial_i \\psi_{ab}$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can write a first-order system in time. The first evolution equation comes directly from the definition of $\\Pi_{ab}$:\n$$ \\partial_t \\psi_{ab} = -\\Pi_{ab} $$\nThe second evolution equation is derived from the wave equation and the definition of $\\Pi_{ab}$:\n$$ \\partial_t \\Pi_{ab} = -\\partial_t^2 \\psi_{ab} = -\\delta^{ij} \\partial_i \\partial_j \\psi_{ab} $$\nUsing the definition of $\\Phi_{iab}$, this becomes:\n$$ \\partial_t \\Pi_{ab} = -\\delta^{ij} \\partial_i (\\partial_j \\psi_{ab}) = -\\delta^{ij} \\partial_i \\Phi_{jab} $$\nThe third evolution equation is for $\\Phi_{iab}$.

To find the characteristic speeds, we perform a plane-wave analysis. We look for solutions of the form $f(t, \\vec{x}) = \\hat{f} \\exp(i(k_j x^j - \\omega t))$, where propagation is in the direction of a spatial unit covector $s_i$, so that the wavevector is $k_j = k s_j$. This ansatz transforms the differential operators as follows: $\\partial_t \\to -i\\omega$ and $\\partial_j \\to ik_j = iks_j$. The characteristic speed is defined as $\\lambda = \\omega/k$.\n\nApplying this transformation to the system of PDEs, we obtain an algebraic system for the amplitudes $(\\hat{\\psi}_{ab}, \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab}, \\hat{\\Phi}_{iab})$:\n$$ -i\\omega \\hat{\\psi}_{ab} = -\\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} \\implies \\lambda \\hat{\\psi}_{ab} = \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} $$\n$$ -i\\omega \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} = -\\delta^{ij} (iks_i) \\hat{\\Phi}_{jab} = -ik s^j \\hat{\\Phi}_{jab} \\implies \\lambda \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} = s^j \\hat{\\Phi}_{jab} $$\n$$ -i\\omega \\hat{\\Phi}_{iab} = -(iks_i) \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} \\implies \\lambda \\hat{\\Phi}_{iab} = s_i \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} $$\n\nThe problem directs us to use the reduced variable triplet $(\\psi_{ab}, \\Pi_{ab}, \\Phi_{sab})$, where $\\Phi_{sab} := s^i \\Phi_{iab}$. In the Fourier domain, this corresponds to $\\hat{\\Phi}_{sab} = s^i \\hat{\\Phi}_{iab}$. We can create an evolution equation for this variable by contracting the third equation with $s^i$:\n$$ s^i (\\lambda \\hat{\\Phi}_{iab}) = s^i (s_i \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab}) \\implies \\lambda (s^i \\hat{\\Phi}_{iab}) = (s^i s_i) \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} $$\nSince $s_i$ is a unit covector, $s^i s_i = \\delta^{ij} s_i s_j = 1$. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\lambda \\hat{\\Phi}_{sab} = \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} $$\nThe second equation involves $s^j \\hat{\\Phi}_{jab} = \\hat{\\Phi}_{sab}$ by definition. So, the second equation is:\n$$ \\lambda \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} = \\hat{\\Phi}_{sab} $$\nThe first equation remains $\\lambda \\hat{\\psi}_{ab} = \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab}$.\n\nWe now have a closed algebraic system for the amplitudes of the reduced triplet $(\\hat{\\psi}_{ab}, \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab}, \\hat{\\Phi}_{sab})$:\n1.  $\\lambda \\hat{\\psi}_{ab} - \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} = 0$\n2.  $\\lambda \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} - \\hat{\\Phi}_{sab} = 0$\n3.  $\\lambda \\hat{\\Phi}_{sab} - \\hat{\\Pi}_{ab} = 0$\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form.
