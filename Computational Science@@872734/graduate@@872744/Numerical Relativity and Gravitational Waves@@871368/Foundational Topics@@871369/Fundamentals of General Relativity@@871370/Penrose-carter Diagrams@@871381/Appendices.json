We solve for $d\\eta$:\n$$d\\eta = \\frac{dt}{\\ell \\cosh(t/\\ell)}$$\nTo find the function $\\eta(t)$, we integrate the above expression. We set the constant of integration to zero by defining $\\eta = 0$ at $t = 0$.\n$$\\eta(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dt'}{\\ell \\cosh(t'/\\ell)}$$\nLet us perform the substitution $u = t'/\\ell$, which implies $du = dt'/\\ell$. The integral becomes:\n$$\\eta(t) = \\int_{0}^{t/\\ell} \\frac{du}{\\cosh(u)} = \\int_{0}^{t/\\ell} \\operatorname{sech}(u) \\,du$$\nThe standard integral of the hyperbolic secant function is $\\arctan(\\sinh(u))$.

A point $i^{+}$ exists if all future-directed timelike geodesics terminate at a single point on the conformal boundary. In de Sitter space, observers at fixed but different spatial locations (e.g., constant $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$) follow worldlines that are vertical lines in the global $(t, \\theta)$ chart. In the conformally compactified $(\\eta, \\theta)$ chart, these worldlines are also vertical lines, stretching from $\\eta = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\eta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The future endpoint of the worldline at $\\theta_1$ is the point $(\\eta, \\theta) = (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\theta_{1})$ on $\\mathcal{I}^{+}$. The future endpoint of the worldline at $\\theta_2$ is $(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\theta_{2})$. Since these are distinct points for $\\theta_1 \\neq \\theta_2$, there is no single point where all timelike curves end. Instead, they end on the entire spacelike surface $\\mathcal{I}^{+}$. Thus, future timelike infinity $i^{+}$ does not exist as a single point.\nBy the same argument based on time-reversal symmetry, past timelike infinity $i^{-}$ also does not exist as a single point; past-directed timelike geodesics originate from the entire spacelike surface $\\mathcal{I}^{-}$. Therefore, the number of timelike boundary points, $N_{i^{\\pm}}$, is $0$.\n\nThe required quantities are:\n1.  $\\Omega^{2}(\\eta) = \\frac{\\ell^{2}}{\\cos^{2}(\\eta)}$\n2.

We consider a past-directed radial null geodesic.\n\nFor a radial geodesic, the angular part of the metric is constant, so $d\\Omega^{2} = 0$. For a null geodesic, the line element is zero, $ds^{2}=0$. The metric equation becomes:\n$$0 = -dt^{2} + a^{2}(t)d\\chi^{2}$$\nThis can be rearranged to give the relationship between the change in comoving coordinate $\\chi$ and the change in cosmic time $t$ for a light ray:\n$$\\frac{d\\chi}{dt} = \\pm \\frac{1}{a(t)}$$\nWe are considering a light ray that travels from a positive comoving coordinate $\\chi  0$ to the observer at $\\chi=0$. As time evolves forward from $t=0$ to $t=t_0$, the coordinate $\\chi$ of the light ray decreases. Therefore, we must choose the negative sign: $d\\chi/dt = -1/a(t)$.\n\nTo find the comoving coordinate $\\chi_{\\mathrm{ph}}(t_0)$, we integrate this equation. The light ray is emitted at $t=0$ from $\\chi=\\chi_{\\mathrm{ph}}(t_0)$ and is received at $t=t_0$ at $\\chi=0$.\n$$\\int_{\\chi_{\\mathrm{ph}}(t_0)}^{0} d\\chi = \\int_{0}^{t_0} \\left(-\\frac{1}{a(t)}\\right) dt$$\nThe left side evaluates to $-\\chi_{\\mathrm{ph}}(t_0)$, so we have:\n$$\\chi_{\\mathrm{ph}}(t_0) = \\int_{0}^{t_0} \\frac{dt}{a(t)}$$\nThis is the general expression for the comoving particle horizon distance.\n\nNow we substitute the given scale factor, $a(t) = a_{0}(t/t_{0})^{p}$:\n$$\\chi_{\\mathrm{ph}}(t_0) = \\int_{0}^{t_0} \\frac{dt}{a_{0}\\left(t/t_{0}\\right)^{p}} = \\frac{t_{0}^{p}}{a_{0}} \\int_{0}^{t_0} t^{-p} dt$$\nWe perform the integration.

The construction of this diagram involves a conformal transformation of the metric. The key step is to introduce conformal time, $\\eta$, defined by $d\\eta = dt/a(t)$.\nThe conformal time elapsed from $t=0$ to a generic time $t$ is:\n$$\\eta(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dt'}{a(t')} = \\frac{t_0}{a_0(1-p)}\\left(\\frac{t}{t_0}\\right)^{1-p}$$\nThe range of cosmic time is $t \\in [0, \\infty)$. Let's find the corresponding range for $\\eta$.\nAs $t \\to 0$, $\\eta \\to 0$.\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, since $1-p  0$, $\\eta \\to \\infty$.\nSo, conformal time ranges from $\\eta \\in [0, \\infty)$. The comoving radial coordinate ranges from $\\chi \\in [0, \\infty)$. The spacetime $(\\eta, \\chi)$ manifold is conformally equivalent to the upper-right quadrant of 2D Minkowski space, which can be compactified into a triangular Penrose diagram.\n\nThe boundaries of this diagram are:\n1.  The past singularity (Big Bang): This corresponds to $t=0$ or $\\eta=0$. It is a spacelike surface and forms the \"bottom\" boundary of the diagram. The point $(\\eta, \\chi) = (0, 0)$ is past timelike infinity, $i^{-}$.\n2.  The central observer's worldline: This is the line $\\chi=0$. It is a timelike worldline and forms the \"left\" vertical boundary of the diagram.\n3.  Future null infinity, $\\mathcal{I}^{+}$: This is the future endpoint of null geodesics that travel out to infinity ($\\chi \\to \\infty$). It forms the \"right\" hypotenuse-like boundary of the diagram.\n4.  Future timelike infinity, $i^{+}$: This is the limit $t \\to \\infty$ ($\\eta \\to \\infty$) for any finite $\\chi$. It is the \"top\" vertex of the triangle where all comoving worldlines converge.\n\nThe \"particle-horizon null curve\" is the past-directed radial null geodesic that reaches the observer. Its endpoints are the emission event and the reception event.\n-   Reception Endpoint: This is the event of observation, $(t, \\chi) = (t_0, 0)$. This is a point on the worldline of the comoving observer at $\\chi=0$. On the Penrose diagram, this event lies on the timelike boundary corresponding to the central worldline, $\\chi=0$.\n-   Emission Endpoint: This is the event from which the light ray originated at the beginning of the universe. Its coordinates are $(t, \\chi) = (0, \\chi_{\\mathrm{ph}}(t_0))$. This event lies on the $t=0$ surface, which is the Big Bang. On the Penrose diagram, this event lies on the past spacelike singularity, which forms the bottom boundary of the diagram.\n\nIn summary, the null geodesic that defines the particle horizon connects a point on the past spacelike singularity (the Big Bang) to a point on the worldline of the comoving observer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1-p}}$$", "id": "3482477"}]}
