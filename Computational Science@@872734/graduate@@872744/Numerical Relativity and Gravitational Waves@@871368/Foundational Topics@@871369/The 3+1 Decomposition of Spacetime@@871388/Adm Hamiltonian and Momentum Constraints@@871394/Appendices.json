Time-symmetry for a non-spinning puncture implies that the extrinsic curvature vanishes identically, $K_{ij} = 0$. In this case, the momentum constraint is trivially satisfied ($0=0$), and the Hamiltonian constraint simplifies to:\n$$\nR = 0\n$$\nThe problem provides the transformation law for the scalar curvature under the conformal transformation $\\gamma_{ij} = \\psi^{4} \\delta_{ij}$:\n$$\nR[\\gamma] = -8 \\psi^{-5} \\nabla^{2} \\psi\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla^2$ is the standard flat-space Laplacian associated with the metric $\\delta_{ij}$.

Its partial derivative with respect to $x^i$ is:\n$$\n\\partial_i \\psi = \\partial_i \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{2\\rho}\\right) = \\frac{M}{2} \\partial_i (\\rho^{-1}) = \\frac{M}{2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\rho^{2}}\\right) \\partial_i \\rho\n$$\nWith $\\rho = \\sqrt{x^k x_k}$, we have $\\partial_i \\rho = \\frac{x_i}{\\rho}$. Substituting this back:\n$$\n\\partial_i \\psi = -\\frac{M}{2\\rho^{2}} \\frac{x_i}{\\rho} = -\\frac{M x_i}{2\\rho^{3}}\n$$\nNow we assemble the expression for $V_i$:\n$$\nV_i = -2 \\partial_i (\\psi^{4}) = -2 (4\\psi^{3}) \\partial_i \\psi = -8\\psi^{3} \\left(-\\frac{M x_i}{2\\rho^{3}}\\right) = \\frac{4M\\psi^{3} x_i}{\\rho^{3}}\n$$\nThe integrand of the energy integral is the scalar product $V_i n^i$. With the unit normal vector $n^i = x^i/\\rho = x_i/\\rho$ (in flat background space):\n$$\nV_i n^i = \\left(\\frac{4M\\psi^{3} x_i}{\\rho^{3}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{x_i}{\\rho}\\right) = \\frac{4M\\psi^{3}}{\\rho^{4}} (x_i x_i)\n$$\nSince $x_i x_i = (x^{1})^{2} + (x^{2})^{2} + (x^{3})^{2} = \\rho^{2}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nV_i n^i = \\frac{4M\\psi^{3}}{\\rho^{4}} \\rho^{2} = \\frac{4M\\psi^{3}}{\\rho^{2}}\n$$\nNow we substitute this back into the energy formula:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ADM}} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi} \\lim_{\\rho\\to\\infty} \\oint_{S_{\\rho}} \\frac{4M\\psi^{3}}{\\rho^{2}} dS\n$$\nThe integrand depends only on the radial coordinate $\\rho$, so it is constant over the spherical surface $S_{\\rho}$. We can therefore pull it out of the integral:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ADM}} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi} \\lim_{\\rho\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{4M\\psi^{3}}{\\rho^{2}} \\oint_{S_{\\rho}} dS \\right)\n$$\nThe integral $\\oint_{S_{\\rho}} dS$ is simply the surface area of the sphere of radius $\\rho$, which is $4\\pi\\rho^{2}$.\n$$\nE_{\\text{ADM}} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi} \\lim_{\\rho\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{4M\\psi^{3}}{\\rho^{2}} \\cdot 4\\pi\\rho^{2} \\right) = \\lim_{\\rho\\to\\infty} (M\\psi^{3})\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\psi = 1 + \\frac{M}{2\\rho}$ and evaluate the limit:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ADM}} = \\lim_{\\rho\\to\\infty} M \\left(1 + \\frac{M}{2\\rho}\\right)^{3}\n$$\nAs $\\rho \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{M}{2\\rho} \\to 0$. Therefore, the limit is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ADM}} = M (1 + 0)^{3} = M\n$$\nThis confirms that the parameter $M$ in the isotropic form of the Schwarzschild metric corresponds to the total ADM energy of the spacetime.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{M}$$", "id": "3463452"}]}
