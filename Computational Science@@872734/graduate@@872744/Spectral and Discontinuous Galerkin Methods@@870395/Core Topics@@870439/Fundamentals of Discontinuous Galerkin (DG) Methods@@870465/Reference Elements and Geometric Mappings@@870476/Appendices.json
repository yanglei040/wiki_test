The anlaysis involves calculating the Jacobian of the mapping and its determinant, and then finding the minimum of the determinant on a specified grid of points.\n\nFirst, we define the reference element and the basis functions. The standard reference triangle is given in coordinates $(r,s)$ as $\\hat{K} = \\{(r,s) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : r \\ge 0, s \\ge 0, r + s \\le 1\\}$.

A $Q=2$ point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule approximates an integral over $[-1,1]$ as a weighted sum of the integrand evaluated at two specific points (nodes). The nodes $t_j$ and weights $w_j$ for $Q=2$ are:\n-   Nodes: $t_{1} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, $t_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n-   Weights: $w_{1} = 1$, $w_{2} = 1$\n\nThe quadrature approximation $I_{2}$ is given by:\n$$ I_{2} = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} w_{j} \\cdot \\left( c \\, J_{f}(t_{j}) \\right) = w_{1} c(1 + 5\\alpha t_{1}^{4}) + w_{2} c(1 + 5\\alpha t_{2}^{4}) $$\nSubstituting the weights and nodes:\n$$ I_{2} = 1 \\cdot c \\left(1 + 5\\alpha \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{4}\\right) + 1 \\cdot c \\left(1 + 5\\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{4}\\right) $$\nWe evaluate the term $t^{4}$:\n$$ \\left(\\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{4} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $I_{2}$:\n$$ I_{2} = c \\left(1 + \\frac{5\\alpha}{9}\\right) + c \\left(1 + \\frac{5\\alpha}{9}\\right) = c \\left(2 + \\frac{10\\alpha}{9}\\right) $$\nThis quadrature rule is exact for polynomials of degree up to $2Q-1 = 2(2)-1 = 3$. Since our integrand involves a term of degree $4$, an error is expected.\n\nFinally, we compute the aliasing error $E$ by subtracting the quadrature approximation $I_{2}$ from the exact integral $I$:\n$$ E = I - I_{2} = c(2 + 2\\alpha) - c \\left(2 + \\frac{10\\alpha}{9}\\right) $$\n$$ E = c \\left( 2 + 2\\alpha - 2 - \\frac{10\\alpha}{9} \\right) = c \\left( 2\\alpha - \\frac{10\\alpha}{9} \\right) $$\n$$ E = c \\left( \\frac{18\\alpha}{9} - \\frac{10\\alpha}{9} \\right) = c \\left( \\frac{8\\alpha}{9} \\right) $$\nThus, the aliasing error is:\n$$ E = \\frac{8}{9} c \\alpha $$\nThis expression represents the error incurred from under-integrating the degree-$4$ geometric factor with a quadrature rule only exact for polynomials up to degree-$3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8}{9} c \\alpha}$$", "id": "3412483"}]}
