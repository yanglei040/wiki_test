The derivation must be from first principles and include a geometric interpretation.\n\nThe reference triangle has vertices $v_{1}=(0,0)$, $v_{2}=(1,0)$, and $v_{3}=(0,1)$. The linear nodal basis functions $\\ell_{j}(x,y)$ are affine functions of the form $\\ell_{j}(x,y) = a_j x + b_j y + c_j$. These functions are also known as the barycentric coordinates.\n\nWe seek the function $\\ell_{1}(x,y)$. By definition of a Lagrange basis, $\\ell_{1}$ must satisfy the following conditions:\n$1.$ $\\ell_{1}(v_{1}) = \\ell_{1}(0,0) = 1$\n$2.$ $\\ell_{1}(v_{2}) = \\ell_{1}(1,0) = 0$\n$3.$ $\\ell_{1}(v_{3}) = \\ell_{1}(0,1) = 0$\n\nWe use these three conditions to determine the coefficients $a_{1}$, $b_{1}$, and $c_{1}$ for $\\ell_{1}(x,y) = a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1$.\nFrom condition $1$:\n$\\ell_{1}(0,0) = a_1(0) + b_1(0) + c_1 = 1 \\implies c_1 = 1$.\n\nFrom condition $2$:\n$\\ell_{1}(1,0) = a_1(1) + b_1(0) + c_1 = 0 \\implies a_1 + c_1 = 0$. Since $c_1=1$, we have $a_1 = -1$.\n\nFrom condition $3$:\n$\\ell_{1}(0,1) = a_1(0) + b_1(1) + c_1 = 0 \\implies b_1 + c_1 = 0$. Since $c_1=1$, we have $b_1 = -1$.\n\nThus, the basis function is $\\ell_{1}(x,y) = -x - y + 1$.\nThis result is consistent with the property that the sum of barycentric coordinates is unity, $\\ell_{1} + \\ell_{2} + \\ell_{3} = 1$. For any point $(x,y)$ in the triangle, its representation in barycentric coordinates is $(x,y) = \\ell_{1}v_{1} + \\ell_{2}v_{2} + \\ell_{3}v_{3}$. Substituting the vertex coordinates gives $(x,y) = \\ell_{1}(0,0) + \\ell_{2}(1,0) + \\ell_{3}(0,1) = ( \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3} )$. This implies $\\ell_{2}(x,y)=x$ and $\\ell_{3}(x,y)=y$. Therefore, $\\ell_{1} = 1 - \\ell_{2} - \\ell_{3} = 1 - x - y$, which confirms our derived expression.\n\nThe gradient of $\\ell_{1}$ is a vector of its partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\ell_{1}(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ell_{1}}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial \\ell_{1}}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ell_{1}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (1 - x - y) = -1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ell_{1}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (1 - x - y) = -1\n$$\nTherefore, the gradient is the constant vector:\n$$\n\\nabla \\ell_{1} = (-1, -1)\n$$\nSince the gradient is constant for a linear function, its value is the same at every point in the domain. The barycentric centroid, given in Cartesian coordinates as $(1/3, 1/3)$, is no exception.\n$$\n\\nabla \\ell_{1}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = (-1, -1)\n$$\nNow, we analyze the geometric interpretation of this result.\n\n**Direction of $\\nabla \\ell_{1}$**:\nThe gradient of a scalar field $\\nabla f$ points in the direction of the steepest ascent of $f$. The basis function $\\ell_{1}$ has a value of $1$ at vertex $v_{1}$ and decreases linearly to $0$ on the opposite edge, $e_{1}$, which connects $v_{2}=(1,0)$ and $v_{3}=(0,1)$. The equation for the line containing edge $e_{1}$ is $x+y=1$. The level sets of $\\ell_{1}(x,y) = 1-x-y$ are lines of the form $1-x-y=C$, or $x+y=1-C$. These lines are all parallel to the edge $e_{1}$. The gradient vector must be orthogonal to these level sets. The vector $\\nabla \\ell_{1} = (-1,-1)$ is indeed orthogonal to any line with a normal vector proportional to $(1,1)$. Since $\\ell_{1}$ increases as we move towards the vertex $v_{1}=(0,0)$, its gradient must point towards the direction of steepest increase. The vector $(-1,-1)$ points from any point $(x,y)$ towards smaller $x$ and $y$ values, which is exactly the direction of steepest ascent for $\\ell_1=1-x-y$, pointing from the edge $e_1$ towards the vertex $v_1$. Hence, the direction of $\\nabla \\ell_1$ is normal to the edge opposite $v_1$ and points into the triangle.\n\n**Magnitude of $\\nabla \\ell_{1}$**:\nThe magnitude of the gradient is the rate of steepest ascent. For a linear basis function, this rate is uniform and is equal to the change in function value ($1-0=1$) divided by the perpendicular distance over which this change occurs. This distance is the height $h_{1}$ of the triangle from vertex $v_{1}$ to the opposite edge $e_{1}$. The magnitude is $|\\nabla \\ell_{1}| = 1/h_{1}$.\nThe height $h_{1}$ is the distance from the point $(0,0)$ to the line $x+y-1=0$. Using the distance formula:\n$$\nh_{1} = \\frac{|1(0) + 1(0) - 1|}{\\sqrt{1^{2} + 1^{2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThus, the magnitude of the gradient should be:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\ell_{1}| = \\frac{1}{h_{1}} = \\frac{1}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nOur calculated gradient $\\nabla \\ell_{1} = (-1, -1)$ has a magnitude of:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\ell_{1}| = \\sqrt{(-1)^{2} + (-1)^{2}} = \\sqrt{1+1} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThis confirms the geometric interpretation.\n\nThe magnitude can also be related to the area of the triangle, $A$, and the length of the opposite edge, $|e_{1}|$. The length of the edge from $v_2=(1,0)$ to $v_3=(0,1)$ is:\n$$\n|e_{1}| = \\sqrt{(1-0)^{2} + (0-1)^{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThe area of the triangle is $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} |e_{1}| h_{1} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe relationship $|\\nabla \\ell_{1}| = 1/h_1$ can be rewritten using $h_1 = 2A/|e_1|$ as:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\ell_{1}| = \\frac{|e_{1}|}{2A} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2(1/2)} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThis provides a complete verification of the derived gradient, both in direction and magnitude, based on the geometry of the reference element.

A polynomial $p(x,y)$ is in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ if it can be written as $p(x,y) = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^j$, where for all terms with non-zero coefficients $c_{ij} \\neq 0$, the exponents satisfy the inequality $i+j \\le N$.

The first part asks for the construction of a specific polynomial. The second part requires a proof of existence or non-existence.\n\n### Part 1: Construction of a polynomial in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$\n\nWe are tasked with finding a nonzero polynomial $f(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y) \\in Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ and $f(x,y) \\notin P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. This means $f(x,y)$ must satisfy the conditions for being in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ while simultaneously failing the condition for being in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.\n\nLet us consider a simple monomial, $f(x,y) = x^i y^j$, where $i$ and $j$ are non-negative integers.\n-   For $f(x,y)$ to be in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$, its exponents must satisfy $i \\le N$ and $j \\le N$.\n-   For $f(x,y)$ to *not* be in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$, its total degree must be greater than $N$, so its exponents must satisfy $i+j > N$.\n\nWe need to find a pair of integers $(i,j)$ that satisfies these three inequalities, given that $N \\ge 2$. A simple and effective strategy is to choose the largest possible values for $i$ and $j$ that are consistent with the conditions for membership in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. Let us select $i=N$ and $j=N$.\n\nWe propose the polynomial $f(x,y) = x^N y^N$. Now, we must justify that this choice is correct based on the degree definitions.\n\n1.  **Verification of membership in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$**: The polynomial $f(x,y) = x^N y^N$ has only one term. The degree of this term in the variable $x$ is $N$, which satisfies the condition $i \\le N$. The degree in the variable $y$ is also $N$, which satisfies the condition $j \\le N$. Therefore, by definition, $f(x,y) \\in Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.\n\n2.  **Verification of exclusion from $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$**: The total degree of the monomial $x^i y^j$ is $i+j$. For our chosen polynomial $f(x,y) = x^N y^N$, the total degree is $N+N = 2N$. For a polynomial to be in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$, the total degree of all its terms must be at most $N$. In our case, this would require $2N \\le N$. This inequality holds only if $N \\le 0$. However, the problem statement specifies that $N \\ge 2$. For any integer $N \\ge 2$, it is true that $2N > N$. Since the total degree of $f(x,y)$ is $2N$, which is strictly greater than $N$, the polynomial $f(x,y)$ is not in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.\n\nWe have thus constructed a nonzero polynomial, $f(x,y) = x^N y^N$, that is in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ but not in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\n### Part 2: Existence of a polynomial in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$\n\nWe are asked to determine if there exists any nonzero polynomial $g(x,y)$ such that $g(x,y) \\in P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ and $g(x,y) \\notin Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. This is equivalent to asking whether the inclusion $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\subseteq Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is true. If it is, then the set difference $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is empty.\n\nLet $g(x,y)$ be an arbitrary polynomial in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. By definition, $g(x,y)$ is a linear combination of monomials $x^i y^j$:\n$$g(x,y) = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^j$$\nwhere for any term with $c_{ij} \\neq 0$, the exponents must satisfy the total degree constraint:\n$$i+j \\le N$$\nSince exponents of a polynomial are non-negative integers, we also have $i \\ge 0$ and $j \\ge 0$.\n\nFrom the inequality $i+j \\le N$, we can derive constraints on the individual exponents $i$ and $j$.\nSince $j \\ge 0$, it follows that $i \\le N - j$. The maximum possible value of $N-j$ occurs when $j$ is at its minimum, which is $j=0$. Thus, $i \\le N-0$, which implies $i \\le N$.\n$$i+j \\le N \\text{ and } j \\ge 0 \\implies i \\le N-j \\le N$$\nSimilarly, since $i \\ge 0$, it follows that $j \\le N - i$. The maximum possible value of $N-i$ occurs when $i$ is at its minimum, which is $i=0$. Thus, $j \\le N-0$, which implies $j \\le N$.\n$$i+j \\le N \\text{ and } i \\ge 0 \\implies j \\le N-i \\le N$$\n\nSo, for any term $c_{ij}x^i y^j$ with $c_{ij} \\ne 0$ in an arbitrary polynomial $g(x,y) \\in P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$, the exponents must satisfy both $i \\le N$ and $j \\le N$.\n\nThis pair of inequalities, $i \\le N$ and $j \\le N$, is precisely the condition for a polynomial's monomials to belong to the space $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. As this holds for all terms of $g(x,y)$, the polynomial $g(x,y)$ itself must be an element of $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.\n\nThis demonstrates that any polynomial that is in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is necessarily also in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. In other words, $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is a subset of $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. Therefore, the set difference $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ contains no elements; it is the empty set.\n\nConclusion: No nonzero polynomial $g(x,y)$ exists in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x^N y^N}$$", "id": "3402568"}, {"introduction": "The primary motivation for using high-order nodal bases is to achieve rapid, or even exponential, convergence.
