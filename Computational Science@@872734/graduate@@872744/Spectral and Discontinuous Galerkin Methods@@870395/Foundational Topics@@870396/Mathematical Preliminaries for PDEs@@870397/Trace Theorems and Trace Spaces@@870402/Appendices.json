We must check these two conditions for $u(x) = x^{\\alpha}$ on the domain $\\Omega=(0,1)$.\n\nCondition 1: $u \\in L^{2}(0,1)$.\nThis condition requires that the $L^{2}$-norm of $u$ is finite.\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} |u(x)|^{2} dx = \\int_{0}^{1} |x^{\\alpha}|^{2} dx = \\int_{0}^{1} x^{2\\alpha} dx\n$$\nThis is a standard p-integral.

We are given that $v \\in H^{1/2}(0,1)$ and $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a constant.

Due to symmetry, we can write the integral as twice the integral over the region $0  s'  s  1$.\n$$\n[f]_{H^{t}(0,1)}^{2} = 2 \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{s} \\frac{|s^{-\\beta} - (s')^{-\\beta}|^{2}}{(s-s')^{1+2t}} \\,\\mathrm{d}s'\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nWe split the inner integral into two parts: $\\int_{0}^{s/2}$ and $\\int_{s/2}^{s}$.\n\nCase 1: $s/2  s'  s$.\nIn this region, $s'$ is close to $s$. We can use the Mean Value Theorem for the function $g(x) = x^{-\\beta}$.

The squared numerator is approximately $(\\beta s^{-\\beta-1}(s-s'))^2 = \\beta^2 s^{-2\\beta-2}(s-s')^2$.\nThe integral over this region, let's call it $I_1$, behaves like:\n$$\nI_1 \\approx \\int_0^1 \\int_{s/2}^s \\frac{\\beta^2 s^{-2\\beta-2}(s-s')^2}{(s-s')^{1+2t}} \\,\\mathrm{d}s'\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\beta^2 \\int_0^1 s^{-2\\beta-2} \\left( \\int_{s/2}^s (s-s')^{1-2t} \\,\\mathrm{d}s' \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThe inner integral evaluates to $\\int_0^{s/2} u^{1-2t} \\,\\mathrm{d}u$ (with substitution $u=s-s'$), which converges for $1-2t  -1$ (i.e., $t1$) and is proportional to $s^{2-2t}$.\nThe outer integral then becomes proportional to:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 s^{-2\\beta-2} s^{2-2t} \\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_0^1 s^{-2\\beta-2t} \\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThis integral converges at $s=0$ if and only if $-2\\beta-2t  -1$, which implies $2\\beta+2t  1$, or $t  \\frac{1}{2} - \\beta$.\n\nCase 2: $0  s'  s/2$.\nIn this region, $s'$ is far from $s$ relative to the scale of $s$. We have $s-s'  s/2 \\implies s-s' \\sim s$. Also, since $s'  s/2$, we have $(s')^{-\\beta}  (s/2)^{-\\beta} = 2^\\beta s^{-\\beta}$, so $(s')^{-\\beta}$ is the dominant term in the difference $|s^{-\\beta} - (s')^{-\\beta}|$. The difference is of the same order as $(s')^{-\\beta}$.\nTherefore, $|s^{-\\beta} - (s')^{-\\beta}|^2 \\sim ((s')^{-\\beta})^2 = (s')^{-2\\beta}$.\nThe integral over this region, $I_2$, behaves like:\n$$\nI_2 \\approx \\int_0^1 \\int_0^{s/2} \\frac{(s')^{-2\\beta}}{s^{1+2t}} \\,\\mathrm{d}s'\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_0^1 s^{-1-2t} \\left( \\int_0^{s/2} (s')^{-2\\beta} \\,\\mathrm{d}s' \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThe inner integral is $\\frac{1}{1-2\\beta} (s/2)^{1-2\\beta}$, which is convergent since $\\beta  1/2$. It is proportional to $s^{1-2\\beta}$.\nThe outer integral then becomes proportional to:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 s^{-1-2t} s^{1-2\\beta} \\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_0^1 s^{-2\\beta-2t} \\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThis converges under the exact same condition as before: $-2\\beta-2t  -1$, which means $t  \\frac{1}{2} - \\beta$.\n\nSo, for $f(s)=s^{-\\beta}$ to be in $H^t(0,1)$, we require both $\\beta  1/2$ (for $L^2$ convergence) and $t  \\frac{1}{2}-\\beta$ (for seminorm convergence). The problem provides $0  \\beta  1/2$. The sharp condition on $t$ is therefore $t  \\frac{1}{2}-\\beta$. This means $f(s) = s^{-\\beta}$ belongs to $H^t(0,1)$ for all $t \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2}-\\beta)$, but not for $t = \\frac{1}{2}-\\beta$.\n\nThe regularity of $Tu(s) = a s^{-\\beta} + v(s)$ is the minimum of the regularities of its components. The regularity of $v(s)$ is $1/2$, and the regularity of $a s^{-\\beta}$ is any $t  \\frac{1}{2} - \\beta$. Since $\\beta0$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}-\\beta  \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the regularity of $Tu(s)$ is determined by the singular term, and $Tu(s)$ belongs to $H^t(0,1)$ for all $t  \\frac{1}{2}-\\beta$.\n\nThe final step is to find the smallest $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ such that $Tu \\in H^{1/2-\\epsilon}(\\Gamma)$.\nThe highest regularity space that $Tu$ belongs to is any space $H^t(\\Gamma)$ for $t  1/2-\\beta$.\nFor $Tu$ to belong to the space $H^{1/2-\\epsilon}(\\Gamma)$, the index of the space, $1/2-\\epsilon$, must be less than the maximal regularity, $1/2-\\beta$.\nSo we must have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon  \\frac{1}{2} - \\beta\n$$\n$$\n-\\epsilon  -\\beta\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon > \\beta\n$$\nThe set of all valid $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ is $(\\beta, \\infty)$, since $\\beta > 0$. The question asks for the smallest such $\\epsilon$. The infimum of the set $(\\beta, \\infty)$ is $\\beta$. This value represents the loss of regularity of the trace $Tu$ compared to the smoother background space $H^{1/2}(\\Gamma)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\beta}$$", "id": "3425117"}]}
