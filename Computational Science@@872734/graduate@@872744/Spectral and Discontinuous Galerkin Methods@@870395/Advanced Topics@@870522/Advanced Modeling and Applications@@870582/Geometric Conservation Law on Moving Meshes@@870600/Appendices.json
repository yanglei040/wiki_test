The code is to be extended to moving meshes via an Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) mapping. Consider a conservation law in a moving physical domain, mapped to a fixed reference domain via a smooth, invertible mapping $\\mathbf{x}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t)$, with Jacobian $J(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t)$ and contravariant basis vectors encoded by $J \\mathbf{a}^i(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t)$ for each reference coordinate $\\xi_i$, and grid velocity $\\mathbf{w}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t) = \\partial_t \\mathbf{x}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t)$.

At each Runge–Kutta stage, compute $J \\mathbf{a}^i$ at all volume and face nodes by a discrete curl form that uses the same SBP derivative matrices as in the volume discretization, thereby satisfying the discrete metric identities. Enforce single-valued face metrics by constructing face normals and surface Jacobians from the stage geometry and sharing them across adjacent elements.\n- Step $2$: Form the ALE contravariant fluxes in each coordinate direction by combining the physical term and the geometric term with grid velocity $\\mathbf{w}$, and discretize both with the same split-form flux differencing and the same two-point symmetric numerical fluxes used by the stationary scheme. In particular, evaluate the geometric flux factor $G^i = J \\mathbf{a}^i \\cdot \\mathbf{w}$ at the same nodes and use single-valued face values for fluxes.\n- Step $3$: Advance the geometry consistently with the solution time integrator by either integrating the discrete geometric conservation law $\\partial_t J + \\sum_i D_i G^i = 0$ with the same Runge–Kutta stages used for the solution, or equivalently by evaluating $J$, $J \\mathbf{a}^i$, and $G^i$ at every stage from the stage geometry. Compute face area metrics and normals from the same stage geometry.\n- Step $4$: Use identical quadrature and interpolation operators for geometry and solution so the SBP identities invoked in the stationary code hold unchanged for the moving-mesh terms. If overintegration is used, apply it consistently to both physical and geometric contributions.\n- Step $5$: Verify free-stream preservation numerically by initializing a constant state and a time-dependent smooth mapping and confirming machine-precision invariance.\n\nB.\n- Step $1$: Compute $J$ and $J \\mathbf{a}^i$ once per time step at $t^n$ by direct nodal differentiation and cross products, hold them fixed within all Runge–Kutta stages, and allow only the grid velocity $\\mathbf{w}$ to vary stage-wise.\n- Step $2$: Use degree $2N-1$ volume quadrature for physical fluxes and degree $N$ for geometric fluxes, and compute face geometric terms independently on each element side. Apply an upwind numerical flux to geometric terms to enhance stability.\n- Step $3$: Do not solve or enforce a discrete equation for $J$; rely on geometric terms in the transformed flux to account for mesh motion and update face metrics once per time step only.\n- Step $4$: Validate only stationary free-stream preservation; moving-mesh free-stream preservation is not enforced.\n\nC.\n- Step $1$: Compute $J \\mathbf{a}^i$ using a discrete curl form at $t^n$ to satisfy discrete metric identities initially, but keep these metrics frozen over the entire time step; recompute $\\mathbf{w}$ at each Runge–Kutta stage from the stage geometry.\n- Step $2$: Combine physical and geometric fluxes using the same two-point numerical flux, but place geometry on Gauss nodes and the solution on Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto nodes, transferring between them by interpolation at each evaluation.\n- Step $3$: Keep $J$ fixed during the step by setting $J^{n+1} = J^n$, assuming the mesh mapping is approximately volume-preserving on average, and update only face areas at the end of the step.\n\nD.\n- Step $1$: Compute $J \\mathbf{a}^i$ at each Runge–Kutta stage by direct differentiation and cross products at nodes using the same derivative matrices, and enforce single-valued face normals by averaging left and right reconstructions.\n- Step $2$: Form separate central two-point numerical fluxes for the physical term and for the geometric contribution involving $u$ and the grid velocity factor $G^i$, and use the same nodes for both.\n- Step $3$: Recompute $J$ from the mapping only at the end of the time step and do not integrate a discrete geometric conservation law for $J$ within Runge–Kutta stages.\n- Step $4$: Overintegrate only the physical fluxes to remove aliasing while keeping geometric fluxes at nodal quadrature to reduce cost.\n\nSelect the correct option and justify your choice based on the conservation structure under the ALE mapping and the requirements for a discrete geometric conservation law in DGSEM.", "solution": "The task is to identify the set of algorithmic conditions sufficient to ensure a Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) satisfies a discrete Geometric Conservation Law (GCL) on moving meshes, thereby preserving a constant free-stream state.\n\n### First Principles Derivation\n\nLet us begin with a general conservation law in a physical domain $(\\mathbf{x}, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\mathbf{f}(u) = 0\n$$\nwhere $u$ is a vector of conserved variables and $\\mathbf{f}(u)$ is the physical flux tensor.\n\nWe introduce an Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) mapping from a fixed reference domain $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ to the moving physical domain $\\mathbf{x}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}, t)\n$$\nThe grid velocity is defined as the velocity of a point with a fixed reference coordinate:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}, t) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial t} \\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\n$$\nTo transform the conservation law to the reference domain, we require the Jacobian of the mapping, $J = \\det(\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\mathbf{x})$, and the unscaled contravariant basis vectors, $\\mathbf{a}^i$, which are the columns of $(\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\mathbf{x})^{-T}$. The problem uses the scaled contravariant vectors $\\mathbf{A}^i = J\\mathbf{a}^i$.\n\nThe transformation of the divergence term is given by the Piola identity:\n$$\nJ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\cdot (J (\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\mathbf{x})^{-T} \\mathbf{v}) = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi_i} (\\mathbf{A}^i \\cdot \\mathbf{v})\n$$\nApplying this to the flux $\\mathbf{f}(u)$, we get the transformed contravariant physical fluxes $\\tilde{f}_i = \\mathbf{A}^i \\cdot \\mathbf{f}(u)$.\n\nThe relationship between time derivatives at fixed physical coordinates and fixed reference coordinates is given by the chain rule for a function $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},t), t)$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} \\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} \\right|_{\\mathbf{x}} + (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\phi) \\cdot \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial t} \\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\implies \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} \\right|_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} \\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} - \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\phi\n$$\nSubstituting $\\partial_t u$ into the original PDE and multiplying by $J$ yields a non-conservative form. To obtain a conservative form in the reference domain, we start from the integral form and apply Reynolds transport theorem, or equivalently, use the continuous GCL. The GCL relates the change in volume of a reference element to the motion of its boundaries:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial t} - \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\cdot (J \\mathbf{w} \\cdot (\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\mathbf{x})^{-T}) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial t} - \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi_i} (\\mathbf{A}^i \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) = 0\n$$\nLet's define the geometric flux factors as $G^i = \\mathbf{A}^i \\cdot \\mathbf{w}$. The GCL is then $\\partial_t J - \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\cdot \\mathbf{G} = 0$, where $\\mathbf{G}$ is the vector with components $G^i$.\n\nUsing the GCL, the original conservation law can be transformed into the following conservative form on the reference domain:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (Ju)}{\\partial t} + \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi_i} (\\tilde{f}_i(u) - u G^i) = 0\n$$\nThis is the ALE conservation law. The total contravariant flux in direction $i$ is $H^i = \\tilde{f}_i(u) - u G^i$.\n\n### Free-Stream Preservation\n\nThe primary goal of the GCL is to ensure that a uniform flow (free-stream) remains uniform. Let $u(\\mathbf{x}, t) = u_c = \\text{const}$. In this case, the physical flux $\\mathbf{f}(u_c)$ is also a constant vector.\nSubstituting $u = u_c$ into the ALE equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (J u_c)}{\\partial t} + \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi_i} (\\mathbf{A}^i \\cdot \\mathbf{f}(u_c) - u_c G^i) = 0\n$$\n$$\nu_c \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial t} + \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi_i} (\\mathbf{A}^i \\cdot \\mathbf{f}(u_c)) - u_c \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial G^i}{\\partial \\xi_i} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{f}(u_c)$ is a constant vector, the second term is $\\mathbf{f}(u_c) \\cdot \\left(\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}^i}{\\partial \\xi_i}\\right)$. A fundamental identity of differential geometry, which results from the fact that $\\mathbf{A}^i$ are derived from derivatives of the mapping $\\mathbf{x}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$, is that this sum is zero: $\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}^i}{\\partial \\xi_i} = 0$. This is often called the \"metric identity\".\nThe equation for the free-stream simplifies to:\n$$\nu_c \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial t} - u_c \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial G^i}{\\partial \\xi_i} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad u_c \\left(\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial t} - \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\cdot \\mathbf{G} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis shows that if the GCL ($\\partial_t J - \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\cdot \\mathbf{G} = 0$) and the metric identity ($\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}_c = 0$) hold, a constant state remains constant.\n\n### Discrete Requirements for DGSEM\n\nFor a DGSEM to be free-stream preserving on a moving mesh, discrete analogues of these two conditions must be satisfied to machine precision. Let the discrete spatial operator be $\\text{Div}_h$.\nThe semi-discrete equation is $\\frac{d(J_h u_h)}{dt} + \\text{Div}_h(\\mathbf{H}_h) = 0$. For $u_h = u_c$:\n$$\nu_c \\frac{d J_h}{dt} + \\text{Div}_h(\\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}_{h,c} - u_c \\mathbf{G}_h) = u_c \\frac{d J_h}{dt} + \\text{Div}_h(\\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}_{h,c}) - u_c \\text{Div}_h(\\mathbf{G}_h)\n$$\nTo have this equal zero, we need:\n1.  **Discrete Metric Identity**: $\\text{Div}_h(\\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}_{h,c}) = 0$. For a DGSEM with SBP operators, this is achieved if the metric terms $\\mathbf{A}^i_h$ are computed using a formulation (e.g., \"discrete curl form\") that uses the *same* SBP derivative matrices as the divergence operator itself. This, combined with a symmetric numerical flux and single-valued face metrics, ensures that the discrete divergence of a constant-vector field vanishes.\n2.  **Discrete Geometric Conservation Law (DGCL)**: $\\frac{d J_h}{dt} - \\text{Div}_h(\\mathbf{G}_h) = 0$. This requires a tight coupling between the time integration of the geometry and the solution. The terms $J_h$, $\\mathbf{A}^i_h$, and $\\mathbf{w}_h$ (which form $\\mathbf{G}_h$) must be updated at every stage of the time-integration scheme (e.g., Runge-Kutta). This can be done by either explicitly integrating the DGCL equation for $J_h$ with the same scheme, or, more robustly, by recomputing all geometric quantities ($J_h$, $\\mathbf{A}^i_h$, $\\mathbf{G}_h$) directly from the mesh coordinates $\\mathbf{x}_h$ at each stage time. This requires representing the geometry $\\mathbf{x}_h$ in the same polynomial space as the solution $u_h$.\n\nFurthermore, all parts of the total flux $\\mathbf{H}_h = \\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}_h - u_h \\mathbf{G}_h$ must be treated identically by the spatial discretization. This means using the same quadrature rules, the same polynomial basis, and applying the same numerical flux scheme to the combined ALE flux.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. This option correctly lists all the necessary components for a valid DGCL-satisfying scheme:**\n- **Step 1**: It mandates representing geometry in the same polynomial space as the solution. It correctly specifies that the discrete metric identities are satisfied by using a discrete curl form with the same SBP derivative matrices. It also correctly requires single-valued face metrics.\n- **Step 2**: It correctly requires that the physical and geometric flux components be combined and discretized with the *same* split-form flux differencing and numerical fluxes, ensuring a consistent treatment that preserves the algebraic cancellation properties.\n- **Step 3**: It correctly describes the two valid, equivalent methods for satisfying the DGCL in time: either explicitly integrating the GCL for $J$ with the same RK scheme, or recomputing all geometry terms at every stage from the stage geometry. This ensures the required tight coupling.\n- **Step 4**: It reinforces the need for consistent operators (quadrature, interpolation) for all terms, which is fundamental to the SBP property and DGCL.\n- **Step 5**: This is a correct verification procedure.\nThis checklist is a precise and sufficient description of a state-of-the-art free-stream preserving ALE-DGSEM. **Correct**.\n\n**B. This option is fundamentally flawed:**\n- **Step 1**: Freezing the metric terms ($J$, $J\\mathbf{a}^i$) for an entire time step and only varying the grid velocity $\\mathbf{w}$ stage-wise is a \"loosely coupled\" approach. It violates the DGCL because the time derivative of the Jacobian $J$ will not be consistent with the divergence of the geometric fluxes $\\mathbf{G}$.\n- **Step 2**: Using different quadrature rules for physical and geometric fluxes is inconsistent and breaks the SBP properties. Using a different numerical flux (upwind) for geometric terms also breaks the cancellation required for free-stream preservation, as the numerical flux must be applied to the total ALE flux $H^i$.\n- **Steps 3 & 4**: Explicitly stating that the GCL is not enforced and moving-mesh free-stream preservation is not a goal confirms this method is incorrect.\n**Incorrect**.\n\n**C. This option is also fundamentally flawed:**\n- **Step 1**: Freezing metrics over a time step is incorrect, as established in B.\n- **Step 2**: Using different node sets (Gauss vs. LGL) for geometry and solution and interpolating between them completely destroys the collocated structure of the DGSEM and the algebraic properties of the SBP operators. All quantities must be represented on the same nodal grid.\n- **Step 3**: Assuming $J$ is constant is a severe and generally false simplification that violates the GCL by definition.\n**Incorrect**.\n\n**D. This option contains critical errors:**\n- **Step 1**: While computing metrics at each stage is correct, the rest is flawed.\n- **Step 2**: Forming separate numerical fluxes for the physical and geometric terms is incorrect. The numerical flux must be applied to the total ALE flux $H^i = \\tilde{f}_i - u G^i$ to ensure the correct non-linear interaction and preservation properties.\n- **Step 3**: Recomputing $J$ from the mapping only at the end of the time step is a form of loose coupling that violates the DGCL. The value of $J$ used in the semi-discrete equation at each RK stage must be consistent with the geometry at that stage.\n- **Step 4**: Using different integration rules for physical and geometric parts is an inconsistent discretization that will fail to preserve the free-stream.\n**Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation from first principles, Option A provides a complete and correct checklist of procedures that are sufficient to ensure the discrete geometric conservation law is satisfied to machine precision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3389196"}, {"introduction": "A key aspect of a GCL-compliant scheme is the exact evaluation of integrals involving geometric terms and the solution.

Define the mesh-velocity flux consistently with mesh motion by $w(\\xi,t)=-\\partial_t x(\\xi,t)$ and approximate all quantities in nodal collocation (that is, set $J_h$ and $w_h$ equal to their exact nodal values at the LGL nodes). Using the diagnostic you derived, compute the element-wise residual $r_K$ for this element. Express $r_K$ as a single real number. No rounding is required.\n\nFinally, explain, at the level of method design, how such an element-wise residual diagnostic can be used to adapt parameters in a mesh motion solver so that the discrete GCL is enforced to a prescribed tolerance in a Spectral or Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method.", "solution": "The problem requires a three-part response: first, the derivation of a discrete Geometric Conservation Law (GCL) residual diagnostic for a spectral element; second, the calculation of this residual for a specific case; and third, an explanation of its use in adaptive mesh motion solvers. The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific soundness and well-posedness. The provided numerical data for the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) scheme is consistent with the Summation-By-Parts (SBP) property, a cornerstone of the requested derivation.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the GCL Residual Diagnostic\n\nThe Geometric Conservation Law (GCL) establishes a necessary condition for a numerical scheme on a moving mesh to preserve a constant solution (a freestream). It relates the rate of change of a control volume's measure to the velocity of its boundary.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental identity for a change of variables from the physical coordinate $x$ to the reference coordinate $\\xi \\in [-1, 1]$ over a moving element $K(t) = [x(\\xi=-1,t), x(\\xi=1,t)]$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{K(t)} dx = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-1}^{1} J(\\xi, t) d\\xi $$\nwhere $J(\\xi,t) = \\partial_{\\xi} x(\\xi, t)$ is the Jacobian of the mapping $x(\\xi, t)$.\n\nThe left-hand side represents the rate of change of the element's length. Let $\\dot{x}(\\xi, t) = \\partial_t x(\\xi, t)$ be the mesh velocity. By the Leibniz integral rule,\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x(-1,t)}^{x(1,t)} dx = \\dot{x}(1, t) - \\dot{x}(-1, t) $$\nThe right-hand side, by moving the derivative inside the integral, is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-1}^{1} J(\\xi, t) d\\xi = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\partial_t J(\\xi, t) d\\xi $$\nEquating the two expressions gives the integral form of the GCL:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} \\partial_t J(\\xi, t) d\\xi = \\dot{x}(1, t) - \\dot{x}(-1, t) $$\nUsing the fundamental theorem of calculus, the right side can be written as an integral: $[\\dot{x}]_{\\xi=-1}^{\\xi=1} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\partial_{\\xi} \\dot{x}(\\xi, t) d\\xi$. This yields:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( \\partial_t J - \\partial_{\\xi} \\dot{x} \\right) d\\xi = 0 $$\nSince this holds for any arbitrary element mapping, the integrand must be zero, giving the strong form of the GCL:\n$$ \\partial_t J - \\partial_{\\xi} \\dot{x} = 0 $$\nThe problem defines a contravariant mesh-velocity flux $w(\\xi, t) = -\\partial_t x(\\xi, t) = -\\dot{x}(\\xi, t)$. Substituting this into the strong form GCL gives the governing equation we will discretize:\n$$ \\partial_t J + \\partial_{\\xi} w = 0 $$\nIn a collocation-based spectral element method using LGL nodes $\\{\\xi_i\\}_{i=0}^{N}$, we represent continuous functions by vectors of their nodal values. Let $\\mathbf{J}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{w}(t)$ be the vectors of nodal values of $J(\\xi, t)$ and $w(\\xi, t)$, respectively. The time derivative is applied pointwise to the nodal values, yielding the vector $\\frac{d\\mathbf{J}}{dt}$. The spatial derivative $\\partial_{\\xi} w$ is approximated at the nodes by applying the LGL first-derivative collocation matrix $D$. The discrete form of the GCL at the nodes is thus:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{J}}{dt} + D\\mathbf{w} \\approx \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe extent to which this equality is not met constitutes the discrete GCL violation. We define the nodal GCL residual vector $\\mathbf{r}$ as:\n$$ \\mathbf{r} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{J}}{dt} + D\\mathbf{w} $$\nA single scalar diagnostic, $r_K$, for the entire element $K$ is obtained by computing a norm of this residual vector. A natural choice is the discrete $L_2$ norm, weighted by the LGL quadrature weights $w_i$, which mimics the continuous $L_2$ integral norm. Let $M$ be the diagonal mass matrix with entries $M_{ii} = w_i$. The weighted norm is:\n$$ r_K = \\| \\mathbf{r} \\|_{M} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{r}^T M \\mathbf{r}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^{N} r_i^2 w_i} $$\nThis scalar value $r_K$ quantifies the element-wise GCL violation. The Summation-By-Parts (SBP) property of the operator pair $(D, M)$, namely $M D + (M D)^T = B$ where $B = \\text{diag}(-1, 0, \\dots, 0, 1)$, ensures that if the nodal residual $\\mathbf{r}$ is zero, the discrete global conservation property is maintained.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Residual\n\nWe are given a single element with $N+1=3$ LGL nodes at $\\xi_0 = -1$, $\\xi_1 = 0$, $\\xi_2 = 1$. The mapping is $x(\\xi,t)=a(t)+b(t)\\xi+c(t)\\xi^{2}$, with coefficients defined by $a'(t)=0$, $b(t)=1+t$, and $c(t)=t$. We evaluate all quantities at $t=1$.\n\n1.  **Nodal Jacobian Vector $\\mathbf{J}$**:\n    The Jacobian is $J(\\xi, t) = \\partial_{\\xi}x = b(t) + 2c(t)\\xi$.\n    At $t=1$, we have $b(1)=2$ and $c(1)=1$.\n    So, $J(\\xi, 1) = 2 + 2\\xi$.\n    Evaluating at the LGL nodes:\n    $J_0 = J(-1, 1) = 2 + 2(-1) = 0$\n    $J_1 = J(0, 1) = 2 + 2(0) = 2$\n    $J_2 = J(1, 1) = 2 + 2(1) = 4$\n    The nodal Jacobian vector is $\\mathbf{J}(1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\n2.  **Nodal Jacobian Time Derivative Vector $\\frac{d\\mathbf{J}}{dt}$**:\n    $\\partial_t J(\\xi, t) = \\partial_t (b(t) + 2c(t)\\xi) = b'(t) + 2c'(t)\\xi$.\n    The given coefficient derivatives are $b'(t) = 1$ and $c'(t) = 1$.\n    So, $\\partial_t J(\\xi, t) = 1 + 2\\xi$. This is independent of $t$.\n    Evaluating at the LGL nodes:\n    $(\\partial_t J)_0 = 1 + 2(-1) = -1$\n    $(\\partial_t J)_1 = 1 + 2(0) = 1$\n    $(\\partial_t J)_2 = 1 + 2(1) = 3$\n    The nodal time derivative vector is $\\frac{d\\mathbf{J}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\n3.  **Nodal Mesh-Velocity Flux Vector $\\mathbf{w}$**:\n    The flux is defined as $w(\\xi, t) = -\\partial_t x(\\xi, t)$.\n    $\\partial_t x = a'(t) + b'(t)\\xi + c'(t)\\xi^2$.\n    With $a'(t)=0$, $b'(t)=1$, $c'(t)=1$, we have $\\partial_t x = \\xi + \\xi^2$.\n    Thus, $w(\\xi, t) = -(\\xi + \\xi^2)$. This is also independent of $t$.\n    Evaluating at the LGL nodes:\n    $w_0 = w(-1) = -(-1 + (-1)^2) = -( -1 + 1 ) = 0$\n    $w_1 = w(0) = -(0 + 0^2) = 0$\n    $w_2 = w(1) = -(1 + 1^2) = -2$\n    The nodal flux vector is $\\mathbf{w}(1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Nodal Residual Vector $\\mathbf{r}$**:\n    The residual vector is $\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{J}}{dt} + D\\mathbf{w}$.\n    First, we compute $D\\mathbf{w}$:\n    $$ D\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} - \\frac{3}{2} & 2 & - \\frac{1}{2}\\\\ - \\frac{1}{2} & 0 & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & -2 & \\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (- \\frac{1}{2})(-2) \\\\ (\\frac{1}{2})(-2) \\\\ (\\frac{3}{2})(-2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    Now, we compute $\\mathbf{r}$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{r} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{J}}{dt} + D\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The nodal residual vector is identically zero. This occurs because the chosen polynomial mapping $x(\\xi, t)$ exactly satisfies the continuous GCL, $\\partial_t J + \\partial_{\\xi} w = (1+2\\xi) + \\partial_{\\xi}(-\\xi-\\xi^2) = (1+2\\xi) + (-1-2\\xi) = 0$. Since the spectral differentiation is exact for the polynomials involved, the discrete residual is also exactly zero.\n\n5.  **Compute the Element-wise Residual $r_K$**:\n    Using the derived formula with the LGL weights $w_0=\\frac{1}{3}$, $w_1=\\frac{4}{3}$, $w_2=\\frac{1}{3}$:\n    $$ r_K = \\sqrt{r_0^2 w_0 + r_1^2 w_1 + r_2^2 w_2} = \\sqrt{0^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + 0^2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} + 0^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}} = 0 $$\nThe element-wise residual is $0$.\n\n### Part 3: Use of the GCL Diagnostic in Adaptive Methods\n\nIn a practical simulation with complex geometries and dynamics, the mesh motion is typically computed via a separate solver (e.g., based on pseudo-elasticity or diffusion equations). The numerical discretization of the mesh movement and the physical conservation laws are not guaranteed to be perfectly compatible, leading to a non-zero discrete GCL residual, $\\mathbf{r} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$. This violation introduces artificial sources or sinks, destroying the conservative property of the scheme and corrupting the physical solution. The element-wise residual diagnostic $r_K$ is a crucial tool to control this error. Its application in an adaptive framework for a Spectral or Discontinuous Galerkin method proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Error Monitoring**: In a time-dependent simulation, after each mesh update (i.e., at each time step), the GCL residual $r_K$ is computed for every element $K$ in the computational domain.\n\n2.  **Error Identification**: The computed values of $r_K$ are compared against a user-defined tolerance, $\\epsilon_{GCL}$. Any element where $r_K > \\epsilon_{GCL}$ is flagged as having an unacceptable level of GCL violation.\n\n3.  **Adaptive Control and Correction**: The set of flagged elements and their corresponding residual magnitudes guide a corrective action. The goal is to adjust the mesh generation process to drive the residuals below the tolerance. Several strategies can be employed:\n    *   **Mesh Solver Parameter Adaptation**: Many mesh motion solvers have tunable parameters, such as mesh stiffness, artificial viscosity, or relaxation factors. These parameters can be adjusted locally in or near the flagged elements. For instance, in regions of high GCL error, one might increase the mesh stiffness to resist deformation, thereby smoothing the Jacobian field $J(\\xi,t)$ and its time derivative, which often reduces the GCL error. This can be framed as an optimization problem to minimize the global GCL error $\\sum_K r_K^2$ by adjusting the field of mesh parameters.\n    *   **Corrective Sub-iterations**: The GCL itself can be treated as a constraint on the mesh position. Within a time step, after computing a new trial mesh position, one can calculate the GCL residual. If it is too high, a correction to the mesh node positions can be computed (e.g., via a Newton-like iteration) to specifically annihilate the GCL residual. This ensures the GCL is satisfied to machine precision before proceeding with the physical solve.\n    *   **Time Step Refinement**: A large GCL error often signals that the mesh is changing too rapidly or non-smoothly for the given time step $\\Delta t$. If the global GCL error (e.g., $\\max_K r_K$) exceeds a certain threshold, the simulation can reject the current time step and retry with a smaller $\\Delta t$. A smaller time step provides a better temporal resolution of the mesh dynamics, generally leading to a smaller GCL error.\n\nBy integrating the GCL residual diagnostic into a feedback loop controlling the mesh solver, one can ensure that the mesh motion remains consistent with the discrete conservation properties of the overall scheme. This active enforcement of the GCL is critical for the accuracy and robustness of simulations on moving and deforming domains, as it guarantees the exact preservation of freestream states.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3389201"}]}
