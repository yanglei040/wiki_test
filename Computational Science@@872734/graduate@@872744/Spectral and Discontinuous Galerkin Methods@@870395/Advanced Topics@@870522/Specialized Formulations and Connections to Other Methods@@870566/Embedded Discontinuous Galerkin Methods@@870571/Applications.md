## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical foundations and numerical mechanics of the embedded discontinuous Galerkin (EDG) method. We now shift our focus from principles to practice. This chapter will demonstrate the remarkable versatility and power of the EDG framework by exploring its application to a diverse set of challenging problems across various scientific and engineering disciplines. A central theme that will emerge is how the distinctive feature of EDG—the use of a globally continuous trace space on the mesh skeleton—not only facilitates efficient computation but also provides elegant solutions to complex modeling challenges. Our exploration will not reteach the core concepts but will instead illuminate their utility, extension, and integration in sophisticated, real-world contexts.

### Fluid and Solid Mechanics: From Incompressible Flow to Elasticity

The simulation of fluid flow and solid deformation represents a cornerstone of [computational mechanics](@entry_id:174464). EDG methods provide a particularly effective framework for these problems, especially those governed by [mixed formulations](@entry_id:167436) and subject to challenging physical constraints.

A canonical example is the **Stokes problem**, which models slow, viscous, incompressible flow. The governing equations form a saddle-point system for the fluid velocity $\boldsymbol{u}$ and pressure $p$. A direct application of standard [finite element methods](@entry_id:749389) often leads to large, ill-conditioned, and indefinite linear systems. Furthermore, stability requires a careful choice of discrete spaces for velocity and pressure to satisfy the celebrated inf-sup (or Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi) condition. The EDG method adeptly addresses these challenges. By employing discontinuous [polynomial spaces](@entry_id:753582) of degree $k$ for the velocity components and degree $k-1$ for the pressure within each element ($\mathbb{P}_k/\mathbb{P}_{k-1}$), the method robustly satisfies the [inf-sup condition](@entry_id:174538) for $k \ge 1$ and thus avoids the spurious pressure oscillations that plague unstable formulations, such as those using equal-order polynomials without additional stabilization [@problem_id:3383231].

Beyond stability, the most significant advantage of the EDG architecture for the Stokes problem lies in its computational structure. The use of element-wise discontinuous fields for velocity and pressure allows these unknowns to be eliminated locally via [static condensation](@entry_id:176722). This process results in a global linear system that involves only the degrees of freedom of the continuous velocity trace on the mesh skeleton. This system is not only dramatically smaller than the original fully-coupled system but, with appropriate stabilization, is also symmetric and positive definite (SPD). This transformation of an indefinite [saddle-point problem](@entry_id:178398) into an SPD one is a profound advantage, as it allows for the use of highly efficient and robust iterative solvers such as the Conjugate Gradient method [@problem_id:3383211].

These principles extend directly to the field of **solid mechanics**, particularly in the modeling of **nearly incompressible [linear elasticity](@entry_id:166983)**. As the Lamé parameter $\lambda$ becomes very large, the material behavior approaches that of an incompressible solid, and standard displacement-based finite element formulations suffer from "[volumetric locking](@entry_id:172606)," a numerical [pathology](@entry_id:193640) that yields overly stiff and inaccurate results. By adopting a [mixed formulation](@entry_id:171379) analogous to the Stokes problem, with pressure representing the volumetric stress, the EDG method can provide a locking-free discretization. The key is to ensure that the stability constants of the method—namely, the coercivity of the deviatoric part on the kernel of the discrete divergence and the inf-sup constant for the displacement-[pressure coupling](@entry_id:753717)—are bounded uniformly with respect to $\lambda$. The same stable pairing of [polynomial spaces](@entry_id:753582) (e.g., $\mathbb{P}_k/\mathbb{P}_{k-1}$) and a [stabilization parameter](@entry_id:755311) independent of $\lambda$ ensures this robustness, making EDG an excellent choice for modeling materials across the full range of compressibility [@problem_id:3383215].

### Transport Phenomena and Wave Propagation

EDG methods offer a unified and robust framework for problems dominated by transport and wave phenomena, which are prevalent in fields ranging from fluid dynamics and [acoustics](@entry_id:265335) to electromagnetics. The design of the numerical fluxes at element interfaces is paramount in these applications.

For the fundamental **one-dimensional [linear advection equation](@entry_id:146245)**, the EDG formulation provides a compelling bridge between modern and classical numerical methods. A detailed derivation reveals that the EDG scheme, with its continuous trace variable, reduces exactly to an upwind [finite difference](@entry_id:142363) or continuous trace recursion that propagates information from the inflow boundary. This demonstrates that the sophisticated machinery of EDG encapsulates the essential physics of [upwinding](@entry_id:756372) in a natural and elegant manner [@problem_id:3383238].

When both convection and diffusion are present, the choice of [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174) for the convective term becomes critical, especially in advection-dominated regimes (i.e., at high Péclet numbers). While a symmetric (or central) flux for the convective term appears straightforward, an energy analysis reveals that it provides no numerical dissipation to control the mismatch between the element interior solution and the skeleton trace. Consequently, its stability relies entirely on the diffusion stabilization, which vanishes as the physical viscosity tends to zero, leading to potential oscillations and instability. In contrast, an upwind-type flux for the EDG convective term introduces a dissipative term proportional to $|\boldsymbol{\beta}\cdot\boldsymbol{n}|(u_h - \lambda_h)^2$. This term provides [robust control](@entry_id:260994) that is independent of the physical viscosity, ensuring the method's stability and [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) uniformly in the Péclet number [@problem_id:3383248].

This robustness extends to problems involving chemical reactions. For an **[advection-diffusion-reaction equation](@entry_id:156456)**, especially one with a stiff reaction term ($\sigma \gg 1$), the EDG method's stability can be made uniform with respect to the reaction coefficient. By treating the reaction term purely element-wise and designing the advective and diffusive stabilization parameters to be independent of $\sigma$, the method's coercivity gracefully incorporates the stabilizing effect of the reaction itself. The resulting energy estimate contains a term of the form $\|\sigma^{1/2} u_h\|^2$, which provides strong control of the solution precisely when the reaction is dominant, mirroring the underlying physics [@problem_id:3383240].

In the realm of **[wave propagation](@entry_id:144063)**, such as that described by the **Helmholtz equation**, high-order methods face the challenge of [numerical pollution](@entry_id:752816), where the [phase error](@entry_id:162993) accumulates over long distances, degrading accuracy. The stability of EDG for the Helmholtz equation depends critically on the resolution of the wave by the mesh. An analysis of the discrete system reveals that stability is contingent upon a resolution condition of the form $\omega h/k \le c_0$, where $\omega$ is the frequency, $h$ is the mesh size, and $k$ is the polynomial degree. This condition dictates that to accurately model higher frequencies, one must either refine the mesh ($h \to 0$) or increase the polynomial order ($k \to \infty$). The analysis also prescribes a necessary scaling for the [stabilization parameter](@entry_id:755311), $\tau \sim k^2$, to ensure [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) of the discrete operator [@problem_id:3383242].

For **nonlinear [hyperbolic conservation laws](@entry_id:147752)**, which develop sharp gradients and shocks, [high-order methods](@entry_id:165413) like EDG must be augmented with **limiters** to suppress [spurious oscillations](@entry_id:152404) while preserving the underlying conservation properties. A successful limiter design must be compatible with the EDG architecture. This entails three key properties: (1) **Conservation**, achieved by modifying only the high-order moments of the solution within each cell, leaving the cell average untouched; (2) **High-order accuracy**, ensured by designing the [limiter](@entry_id:751283) to act as the identity map in regions where the solution is smooth; and (3) **Trace continuity**, a unique requirement for EDG. After limiting the interior solution $u_h$, the continuous trace $\lambda_h$ must be updated to remain consistent. A natural and effective way to achieve this is to compute a new trace $\lambda_h^{\mathrm{lim}}$ as the global $L^2$ projection of the limited interior solution's traces onto the continuous skeleton space [@problem_id:3383273].

### High-Performance and Scientific Computing Aspects

Beyond its applicability to specific physical models, the structure of the EDG method has profound implications for [computational efficiency](@entry_id:270255), reliability, and [scalability](@entry_id:636611) on modern high-performance computing (HPC) platforms.

A key computational trade-off exists between EDG and its close relative, the standard Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method. By enforcing $C^0$ continuity in its trace space, EDG significantly reduces the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom. For a 2D problem of polynomial degree $k$ on a mesh with $N_v$ vertices and $N_{edges}$ edges, the number of global unknowns for EDG is $N_v + (k-1)N_{edges}$, compared to $(k+1)N_{edges}$ for a standard HDG method with a fully discontinuous trace space. This reduction in system size can be substantial. However, this benefit comes at a price: EDG generally forfeits the special post-processing superconvergence property (convergence at order $h^{k+2}$) that is a hallmark of many HDG methods for the Poisson problem. The choice between EDG and HDG thus involves a trade-off between a smaller global system and a higher potential for accuracy via post-processing.

The SPD system resulting from EDG [static condensation](@entry_id:176722) is well-structured but can be ill-conditioned, necessitating effective preconditioning. Auxiliary space preconditioning provides a powerful and robust strategy. The principle is to leverage the well-developed solver technology for standard continuous Galerkin (CG) methods. One constructs a preconditioner for the EDG trace system by using an AMG (Algebraic Multigrid) V-cycle for an auxiliary CG stiffness matrix defined on the same mesh. The connection between the two systems is established via a stable [extension operator](@entry_id:749192) that maps an EDG trace function to a function in the CG space. The stability of this mapping guarantees that the energy norms of the two systems are spectrally equivalent. This allows the optimal scalability of AMG for CG problems to be transferred to the EDG system, resulting in a [preconditioner](@entry_id:137537) whose performance is robust with respect to mesh size $h$ and polynomial degree $p$ [@problem_id:3383213].

To ensure the reliability and efficiency of simulations, **[a posteriori error estimation](@entry_id:167288)** and **[adaptive mesh refinement](@entry_id:143852) (AMR)** are indispensable tools. EDG methods are fully compatible with [residual-based error estimators](@entry_id:168480). A local [error indicator](@entry_id:164891) for an element $K$ can be constructed from three components: (1) the element residual, which measures how well the PDE is satisfied in the interior of $K$; (2) the face residual, which measures the flux discrepancy across $\partial K$ in a manner consistent with the EDG [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174); and (3) the [data oscillation](@entry_id:178950), which accounts for the unresolvable part of the [source term](@entry_id:269111). These local indicators can be summed to estimate the total error and, more importantly, can drive an AMR loop. Using a strategy like Dörfler marking, one can identify a minimal set of elements contributing to a bulk fraction of the total estimated error and refine only those elements, leading to highly efficient computations that concentrate effort where it is most needed [@problem_id:3383205].

Finally, the design of a numerical method strongly influences its **[parallel scalability](@entry_id:753141)**. A performance model comparing DG, HDG, and EDG reveals important differences in communication costs. In a distributed-memory setting, communication time is a function of latency (the time to initiate a message) and bandwidth (the rate of [data transfer](@entry_id:748224)). DG methods require exchanging data from both sides of an inter-process boundary, leading to a relatively large message volume. HDG and EDG both reduce this volume by communicating only a single trace variable. EDG, by virtue of its continuous trace space, communicates even fewer degrees of freedom than a standard discontinuous-trace HDG method. This reduction in communication volume makes EDG particularly attractive for bandwidth-limited architectures, potentially yielding superior strong-scaling performance where the problem size per process is small [@problem_id:3383250].

### Advanced Modeling and Interdisciplinary Coupling

The EDG framework's flexibility extends to complex geometries and the coupling of different physical or numerical models, making it a powerful tool for modern multi-scale and multi-[physics simulations](@entry_id:144318).

When discretizing problems on domains with **curved boundaries**, the accuracy of the geometric representation is as important as the polynomial degree of the solution. To preserve the conservation properties inherent in the governing equations, the mapping of vector-valued fields, such as the flux variable $\boldsymbol{q}$, from a [reference element](@entry_id:168425) to a physical curved element requires a special transformation. The **contravariant Piola transformation** is precisely the mapping that ensures the divergence theorem is preserved between the reference and physical spaces. This preserves the structure of flux integrals and is essential for a correct and conservative formulation on curved meshes [@problem_id:3383209]. This geometric fidelity has direct consequences for convergence. To achieve the optimal error convergence rate of $O(h^{p+1})$ in the $L^2$ norm for a solution approximated with polynomials of degree $p$, the geometric mapping itself must be a polynomial of degree $r \ge p$. If the geometry is under-resolved ($r  p$), the geometric error will dominate and limit the overall accuracy of the simulation, regardless of how high the solution's polynomial degree is [@problem_id:3383241].

Perhaps one of the most compelling features of EDG is its suitability for **multi-method and domain decomposition** applications. The globally continuous trace variable serves as a natural interface or "mortar" variable for coupling disparate models. Consider a scenario where a domain is partitioned into subdomains with non-matching grids, with EDG used on one side of an interface and a Finite Volume (FV) method on the other. A [conservative coupling](@entry_id:747708) can be established by enforcing flux continuity across the interface. The EDG trace variable $\hat{u}$ can be defined as the state on the interface, and the numerical flux on both sides can be set in terms of it. To transfer information from the FV side to the EDG side, for example, the piecewise-constant FV data can be projected onto the continuous EDG trace space. Because the [constant function](@entry_id:152060) is part of the polynomial trace space, this $L^2$ projection conserves the mean value across the interface, providing a foundation for a globally conservative hybrid scheme [@problem_id:3383264]. This flexibility makes EDG an ideal candidate for complex simulations where different physical models or numerical discretizations are best suited for different parts of the computational domain.
