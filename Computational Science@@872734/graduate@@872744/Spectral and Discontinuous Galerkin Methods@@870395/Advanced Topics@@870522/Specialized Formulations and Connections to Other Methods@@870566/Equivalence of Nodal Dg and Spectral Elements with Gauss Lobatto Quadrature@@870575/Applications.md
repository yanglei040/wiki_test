## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the foundational principles of nodal Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Spectral Element Methods (SEM), culminating in the remarkable algebraic equivalence between the two when constructed on Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) quadrature nodes for linear hyperbolic and elliptic problems. This equivalence is far more than a theoretical curiosity; it is the cornerstone of a unified framework for developing [high-order numerical methods](@entry_id:142601) that are robust, efficient, and applicable to a vast range of problems in science and engineering. This chapter explores the practical implications and theoretical extensions of this equivalence, demonstrating its utility in contexts far beyond the simple model problems used for its initial derivation. We will investigate how this core concept is leveraged in nonlinear systems, complex geometries, [adaptive meshing](@entry_id:166933), and its deep connections to other families of [high-order schemes](@entry_id:750306).

### Computational Efficiency and Implementation

The equivalence of nodal DG and SEM on GLL grids has profound implications for software implementation and computational performance. Because the underlying elemental operators can be rendered identical, both methods can be implemented using a common software infrastructure. This shared foundation simplifies code development and maintenance while allowing for a direct comparison of the subtle but important differences that remain.

A cornerstone of this efficiency is the property of **[mass lumping](@entry_id:175432)**. When using a nodal basis collocated with the quadrature points, as is the case with GLL nodes and GLL quadrature, the elemental [mass matrix](@entry_id:177093) becomes diagonal. Each diagonal entry is simply the GLL quadrature weight at the corresponding node, scaled by the geometric Jacobian. This diagonalization is automatic and exact, a direct consequence of the Kronecker-delta property of the nodal Lagrange basis at the collocation points. For time-dependent problems solved with [explicit time-stepping](@entry_id:168157) schemes (such as explicit Runge-Kutta methods), this is a monumental advantage. Inverting the mass matrix, a necessary step in each time stage to solve for the time derivative of the solution, reduces from a potentially costly [matrix inversion](@entry_id:636005) to a simple, element-wise scaling by the inverse of the nodal mass. This identical, highly efficient procedure for inverting the [mass matrix](@entry_id:177093) is a key feature that unifies the implementation pipeline for both DG and SEM [@problem_id:3385253].

Furthermore, for problems discretized on tensor-product elements (quadrilaterals in 2D, hexahedra in 3D), the application of volume operators, such as the differentiation or stiffness operators, can be performed with exceptional efficiency using **sum-factorization**. This technique avoids the explicit formation and storage of large, multi-dimensional operator matrices by decomposing the operation into a sequence of one-dimensional applications along each coordinate axis. Since the elemental volume operators for nodal DG and SEM are identical, they both benefit from the same sum-factorization strategy. This results in identical arithmetic intensity and data movement patterns for the most computationally intensive part of the [spatial discretization](@entry_id:172158), leading to comparable performance in matrix-free implementations [@problem_id:3385253].

The primary difference in computational cost arises from the treatment of element interfaces. While the SEM formulation enforces continuity directly through [global assembly](@entry_id:749916), the DG method requires the computation of [numerical fluxes](@entry_id:752791) at each of the $2d$ faces of an element in $d$ dimensions. This introduces an additional computational cost for DG that is concentrated on the element boundaries. For a diffusion problem, for instance, the volume contribution to the stiffness operator application costs approximately $O(d N^{d+1})$ floating-point operations per element (where $N$ is the polynomial degree), a cost identical for both DG and SEM. However, the DG method incurs an additional cost of $O(d N^{d-1})$ operations per element for the evaluation of face-based penalty terms. While the volume term dominates for high polynomial degrees $N$, the face term cost is non-negligible and represents a clear performance differentiator between the two approaches [@problem_id:3385257].

### Unification Through Summation-By-Parts (SBP) Operators

The equivalence between nodal DG and GLL-based SEM can be understood at a deeper level through the framework of Summation-By-Parts (SBP) operators. An SBP operator is a discrete derivative that mimics the integration-by-parts property of the continuous derivative. For a given GLL [quadrature rule](@entry_id:175061) with a [diagonal mass matrix](@entry_id:173002) $M$ and a corresponding [differentiation matrix](@entry_id:149870) $D$, the operator pair $(M, D)$ satisfies the SBP property $MD + (MD)^T = B$, where $B$ is a [boundary operator](@entry_id:160216) with non-zero entries only at the element endpoints.

This framework allows different numerical methods to be cast into a unified algebraic structure. For instance, the [semi-discretization](@entry_id:163562) of the [linear advection equation](@entry_id:146245), $u_t + a u_x = 0$, can be expressed for a variety of schemes as a system of ordinary differential equations.
- A **Finite Difference SBP** method with Simultaneous Approximation Terms (SATs) to impose boundary conditions.
- A **Nodal DG-SEM** method where boundary conditions are imposed via numerical fluxes.
- A **collocated SEM** method where boundary data is injected directly.

By applying an [energy method](@entry_id:175874)—multiplying the semi-discrete equation by $u^T M$ and using the SBP identity—one can analyze the stability of each scheme. This analysis reveals that for the schemes to be stable (i.e., for the discrete energy to be non-increasing), the penalty parameters in the SAT formulation and the dissipation parameters in the [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174) formulation must satisfy equivalent conditions. For example, for a left-inflow boundary, the SBP-SAT [penalty parameter](@entry_id:753318) $\tau$ and the DG [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174) parameter $\lambda$ are related, and the condition for [energy stability](@entry_id:748991) in one method maps directly to the condition in the other. This demonstrates that these seemingly different methods are, in fact, members of a single family of provably stable SBP discretizations, with the specific formulation often being a matter of notational or implementational preference [@problem_id:3385281].

### Application to Nonlinear Conservation Laws

A critical test for any numerical method is its application to [nonlinear conservation laws](@entry_id:170694), such as the Euler equations of gas dynamics or the [shallow water equations](@entry_id:175291). Here, the straightforward equivalence between DG and SEM breaks down, but the underlying principles provide a clear path forward. For a nonlinear flux function $f(u)$, the [volume integral](@entry_id:265381) in the [weak form](@entry_id:137295), $\int \nabla v \cdot f(u) \, dx$, involves a nonlinear composition. If $u$ is a polynomial of degree $N$, $f(u)$ is generally not a polynomial that can be integrated exactly by the $(N+1)$-point GLL quadrature. This introduction of [aliasing error](@entry_id:637691) invalidates the simple equivalence observed in the linear case.

Two primary strategies have been developed to address this challenge and recover a stable, conservative, and unified DG/SEM framework.

#### De-aliasing via Over-integration

The most direct approach to eliminate [aliasing error](@entry_id:637691) for polynomial nonlinearities is **over-integration**. By evaluating the [volume integral](@entry_id:265381) with a higher-order quadrature rule that is exact for the integrand, the [aliasing error](@entry_id:637691) is removed, and the equivalence between the DG and SEM weak forms can be restored. For example, for a [scalar conservation law](@entry_id:754531) with a polynomial flux of degree $m$, the integrand in the [weak form](@entry_id:137295), $f(u_h) \partial_x v_h$, is a polynomial of degree up to $(m+1)N - 1$. A GLL quadrature rule with $M+1$ points is exact for polynomials of degree up to $2M-1$. To ensure exact integration, one must therefore choose $M \ge \lceil \frac{(m+1)N}{2} \rceil$. For the common case of the inviscid Burgers' equation, where $f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2$ and $m=2$, this requires a quadrature rule capable of integrating polynomials of degree $3N-1$ [@problem_id:3385247]. By employing such an over-integrated quadrature (typically using Gauss-Legendre points for efficiency), the volume terms in the DG and SEM formulations again become identical. Consequently, if a central flux is used in the DG method (which vanishes for a continuous solution), the assembled DG and SEM residuals for a continuous solution will match to machine precision [@problem_id:3385294].

#### Split-Form Discretizations and Energy Stability

While effective, over-integration can be computationally expensive. A more elegant and often more efficient approach is the use of **split-form** or **skew-symmetric** discretizations. This strategy involves reformulating the nonlinear term into a [non-conservative form](@entry_id:752551) that is mathematically equivalent in the continuous sense but has superior properties upon [discretization](@entry_id:145012). For a general conservation law $\partial_t u + \partial_x f(u) = 0$, a split form could be, for example, $\partial_t u + \frac{1}{2}\partial_x f(u) + \frac{1}{2}(f'(u)\partial_x u) = 0$.

When discretized using an SBP operator, certain split forms result in a volume term that is skew-symmetric with respect to the discrete [energy norm](@entry_id:274966). This means the [volume integrals](@entry_id:183482) do not contribute to the growth or decay of energy, isolating all energy changes to the element interfaces. This property holds even in the presence of aliasing, making the scheme nonlinearly stable without the need for expensive over-integration. Remarkably, for certain equations like Burgers' equation, a properly constructed split-form [discretization](@entry_id:145012) can be shown to be algebraically identical to the de-aliased weak form obtained via over-integration [@problem_id:3385244]. This establishes a profound link: the stability provided by the split-form's skew-symmetry is equivalent to the stability provided by removing aliasing errors.

This unified SBP-based approach, combining a skew-symmetric volume term with an entropy-stable interface flux, allows for the construction of nodal DG and SEM schemes that are algebraically identical and provably nonlinearly stable. This represents a significant achievement in the design of [high-order methods](@entry_id:165413) for CFD [@problem_id:3385315].

### Advanced Geometries and Adaptive Meshing

Real-world applications rarely involve simple, static, Cartesian meshes. The principles of DG-SEM equivalence and stability must therefore be extended to handle geometric complexity and [mesh adaptation](@entry_id:751899).

#### Curved and Moving Meshes: The Geometric Conservation Law (GCL)

When solving problems on curvilinear or time-dependent moving meshes (as in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian, or ALE, framework), the transformation from the physical domain to the reference computational element introduces geometric metric terms and a time-dependent Jacobian. For a numerical scheme to be robust and accurate, it must preserve a constant or "free-stream" solution exactly. This property is guaranteed if the discretization satisfies the **Geometric Conservation Law (GCL)**. The GCL is a high-order, discrete statement that the divergence of the metric terms is zero.

For tensor-product GLL discretizations, the commutation property of the discrete derivative operators ($D_r D_s = D_s D_r$) ensures that the discrete GCL is automatically satisfied on stationary curvilinear elements, provided the metric terms are computed by differentiating the nodal coordinates. This satisfaction is necessary and sufficient to maintain the equivalence of the DG and SEM volume discretizations for constant states [@problem_id:3385312].

On moving meshes, the GCL takes on a time-dependent form, relating the time derivative of the Jacobian to the divergence of the mesh velocity. A conservative DG-SEM formulation, which evolves the conserved quantity $Ju$, is inherently conservative. A non-conservative, "split-form" SEM, which evolves the primitive variable $u$, is only conservative—and thus equivalent to the DG-SEM formulation—if the discrete GCL is satisfied. Violating the GCL introduces a spurious mass source into the non-conservative formulation, leading to a drift in conserved quantities and a divergence between the two methods [@problem_id:3385319].

#### Non-Conforming Meshes: Mortar Methods

For many applications, particularly in CFD, it is highly desirable to use [non-conforming meshes](@entry_id:752550), where the mesh resolution can vary locally through $h$-refinement (element size) or $p$-refinement (polynomial degree). At the interface between elements of different sizes or degrees, the simple one-to-one node mapping is lost, breaking the standard SEM assembly procedure and the simple DG flux coupling.

**Mortar methods** provide a mathematically rigorous framework for coupling non-conforming interfaces. A "mortar" space, which is an independent [polynomial space](@entry_id:269905) defined on the interface, is introduced. The solution traces from the adjacent "slave" elements are projected onto this mortar space. A [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174) can then be computed in the mortar space, and the result is projected back to the slave faces to enforce coupling.

For the DG-SEM equivalence and its desirable [energy stability](@entry_id:748991) properties to be maintained across such an interface, the mortar coupling must be constructed with care. This typically requires:
1.  The use of $L^2$ projections to transfer information between the slave traces and the mortar space.
2.  Sufficient accuracy in the mortar space and its quadrature rule to ensure the projections are exact for the polynomials involved. For $p$-refinement, this often means the mortar degree $p_m$ must be at least $\max(p^-, p^+) + 1$ [@problem_id:3385246].
3.  The use of a central (non-dissipative) flux on the mortar to mimic the energy-conserving nature of a conforming SEM interface.
4.  Adjoint consistency between the projection and back-[projection operators](@entry_id:154142) to ensure a conservative [energy transfer](@entry_id:174809).

When these conditions are met, the non-conforming DG coupling becomes algebraically equivalent to a correctly assembled non-conforming SEM, enabling the use of powerful [adaptive mesh refinement](@entry_id:143852) strategies within this unified framework [@problem_id:3385278].

### Interdisciplinary Context and Conclusion

The applications discussed highlight the profound utility of the DG-SEM equivalence and its underlying SBP structure. This unified framework is not merely an academic exercise but a practical foundation for state-of-the-art computational tools across numerous disciplines.

In **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**, these methods are used to perform high-fidelity simulations of turbulence, [aeroacoustics](@entry_id:266763), and combustion. The ability to build provably stable schemes for the nonlinear Euler and Navier-Stokes equations is a direct result of the energy-based analysis enabled by the SBP framework. For problems with [shock waves](@entry_id:142404), this stable high-order baseline scheme is often augmented with [artificial viscosity](@entry_id:140376). The principles of equivalence extend here, as conditions can be derived under which the viscosity operators in DG and SEM are identical, ensuring consistent shock-capturing behavior [@problem_id:3385332].

The equivalence also extends to second-order elliptic and parabolic problems, such as those found in **heat transfer**, **structural mechanics**, and **electromagnetics**. Different variants of DG, such as the Symmetric Interior Penalty (IP) or the Bassi and Rebay 2 (BR2) methods, can be shown to be equivalent to the standard SEM for the [diffusion operator](@entry_id:136699) by selecting a specific value for the DG penalty parameter. This value is precisely what is needed to enforce a strong form of continuity at the interface, effectively transforming the discontinuous method into its continuous counterpart [@problem_id:3385276].

In conclusion, the equivalence of nodal DG and GLL-based SEM provides a powerful and unifying perspective on [high-order methods](@entry_id:165413). It reveals that two methods, born from different philosophies, converge to the same discrete operators under specific, well-understood conditions. This insight, generalized through the language of SBP operators, allows for the systematic design of stable, efficient, and accurate schemes for a wide variety of complex physical phenomena, paving the way for the next generation of predictive scientific simulations.
