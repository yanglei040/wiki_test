The derivation is based on perturbation theory, which is valid only when the coupling is small, i.e., $g^{2}(\\mu) \\ll 1$. The sign of $b_{0}$ is critical. Since $b_{0} > 0$:\n1.  For energy scales $\\mu > \\mu_{0}$, the term $\\ln(\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_{0}})$ is positive. The denominator $1 + 2b_{0} g_{0}^{2} \\ln(\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_{0}})$ is greater than $1$, so $g^{2}(\\mu) < g_{0}^{2}$. As $\\mu \\to \\infty$, $\\ln(\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_{0}}) \\to \\infty$, and thus $g^{2}(\\mu) \\to 0$. This behavior, where the coupling weakens at high energies, is known as asymptotic freedom. In this regime, the perturbative approximation becomes increasingly accurate.\n2.  For energy scales $\\mu < \\mu_{0}$, the term $\\ln(\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_{0}})$ is negative. The coupling $g^{2}(\\mu)$ increases as $\\mu$ decreases. The one-loop solution ceases to be applicable when the denominator approaches zero, as this implies a divergence in the coupling, $g^{2}(\\mu) \\to \\infty$. This is a \"Landau pole\" and signals the breakdown of perturbation theory. The characteristic scale, let's call it $\\Lambda$, at which this divergence occurs is found by setting the denominator to zero:\n$$\n1 + 2b_{0} g_{0}^{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu_{0}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu_{0}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2b_{0} g_{0}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu_{0}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2b_{0} g_{0}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\mu_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2b_{0} g_{0}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis scale $\\Lambda$ represents the energy at which the coupling becomes non-perturbatively large. For $\\mu < \\Lambda$, the denominator becomes negative, and $g^{2}(\\mu)$ becomes negative, which is unphysical. Therefore, the domain of validity for this one-loop solution is for energy scales $\\mu \\gg \\Lambda$.

Use the two-loop coefficients for $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$ corresponding to each $n_{f}$.\n\n- Test A (moderate separation, five flavors):\n  - $n_{f} = 5$, $\\mu_{0} = 91.1876\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0}) = 0.118$, $\\delta \\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0}) = 0.0005$.\n  - $\\mu_{H} = 200\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\mu_{L} = 20\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$.\n  - $C_{0} = 1.0$, $K_{1} = 1.2$, $K_{2} = 0.8$, $Q_{1} = 0.5$, $Q_{2} = 0.3$, $Q_{3} = 0.2$.\n  - $s_{\\max} = 1.0$.\n\n- Test B (large separation, five flavors):\n  - $n_{f} = 5$, $\\mu_{0} = 91.1876\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0}) = 0.118$, $\\delta \\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0}) = 0.0005$.\n  - $\\mu_{H} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\mu_{L} = 5\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$.\n  - $C_{0} = 0.75$, $K_{1} = 2.0$, $K_{2} = 1.5$, $Q_{1} = 1.2$, $Q_{2} = 0.9$, $Q_{3} = 0.4$.\n  - $s_{\\max} = 1.0$.\n\n- Test C (lower reference scale, four flavors):\n  - $n_{f} = 4$, $\\mu_{0} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0}) = 0.18$, $\\delta \\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0}) = 0.002$.\n  - $\\mu_{H} = 50\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\mu_{L} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$.\n  - $C_{0} = 1.2$, $K_{1} = 1.0$, $K_{2} = 1.7$, $Q_{1} = 0.7$, $Q_{2} = 0.6$, $Q_{3} = 0.5$.\n  - $s_{\\max} = 0.8$.\n\nIn all tests, convert the provided $\\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0})$ and $\\delta \\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0})$ into $a_{0} = \\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0})/(4\\pi)$ and $\\delta a_{0} = \\delta \\alpha_{s}(\\mu_{0})/(4\\pi)$ before solving the renormalization group equation.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program must produce a single line of output containing the three triplets for the tests in the order A, B, C, formatted as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each triplet must itself be a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as $[\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}}, \\Delta_{-}, \\Delta_{+}]$. For example, a valid output shape is\n$$\n\\big[ [x_{A}, y_{A}, z_{A}], [x_{B}, y_{B}, z_{B}], [x_{C}, y_{C}, z_{C}] \\big],\n$$\nwhere $x_{i}$, $y_{i}$, and $z_{i}$ are real numbers representing the central value, the total downward uncertainty, and the total upward uncertainty, respectively. The numbers are dimensionless. Your program must not read any input and must not print anything else.", "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a computational procedure to evaluate a multi-scale perturbative observable in a non-Abelian gauge theory, specifically $\\operatorname{SU}(3)$ Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and to quantify the associated theoretical uncertainties. These uncertainties arise from three primary sources: the ambiguity in choosing the renormalization scales, the dependence on the renormalization scheme, and the experimental error on the input value of the strong coupling constant.\n\nThe theoretical foundation is the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE) for the dimensionless coupling $a(\\mu) = \\alpha_s(\\mu)/(4\\pi)$. The RGE describes how the coupling \"runs\" with the energy scale $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{d a(\\mu)}{d \\mu} = \\beta(a(\\mu))\n$$\nAs specified, the beta function $\\beta(a)$ is truncated at two-loop order:\n$$\n\\beta(a) = -\\beta_{0}\\, a^{2} - \\beta_{1}\\, a^{3}\n$$\nThe coefficients $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$ are universal at this order in mass-independent renormalization schemes. For an $\\operatorname{SU}(3)$ gauge theory with $n_{f}$ active quark flavors, they are given by:\n$$\n\\beta_{0} = 11 - \\frac{2}{3}n_{f} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\beta_{1} = 102 - \\frac{38}{3}n_{f}\n$$\n\nTo solve the RGE, it is convenient to change the independent variable from the scale $\\mu$ to its natural logarithm, $t = \\ln \\mu$. With this change, the differential operator becomes $\\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} = \\frac{d}{d(\\ln\\mu)} = \\frac{d}{dt}$. The RGE is transformed into a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in terms of $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d a(t)}{d t} = \\beta(a(t)) = -\\beta_{0}\\, a(t)^{2} - \\beta_{1}\\, a(t)^{3}\n$$\nThis ODE can be solved numerically given an initial condition $(t_{0}, a_{0})$, where $t_0=\\ln\\mu_0$ and $a_{0}=a(\\mu_0)$. We will employ a numerical ODE solver, specifically `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, to obtain high-precision values of $a(\\mu)$ at any target scale $\\mu$ by integrating from the reference scale $\\mu_0$.\n\nThe problem defines a generic perturbative observable $\\mathcal{O}$ that depends on two distinct physical scales, a high scale $\\mu_H$ and a low scale $\\mu_L$. Its expression, truncated at second order in the coupling, is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = C_{0}\\,\\Big( 1 + K_{1}\\, a_{s}(\\mu_{H}) + K_{2}\\, a_{s}(\\mu_{L}) + Q_{1}\\, a_{s}^{2}(\\mu_{H}) + Q_{2}\\, a_{s}^{2}(\\mu_{L}) + Q_{3}\\, a_{s}(\\mu_{H})\\, a_{s}(\\mu_{L}) \\Big)\n$$\nHere, $a_s(\\mu)$ is the coupling in a specific renormalization scheme, related to our running coupling $a(\\mu)$ by a transformation parameterized by $s$:\n$$\na_{s}(\\mu) = a(\\mu) + s\\, a(\\mu)^{2}\n$$\nThe parameter $s$ quantifies the choice of scheme. The default or 't Hooft-Veltman scheme corresponds to $s=0$.\n\nThe computational procedure involves the following steps for each test case:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The input values for $\\alpha_s(\\mu_0)$ and its uncertainty $\\delta\\alpha_s(\\mu_0)$ are converted to $a_0 = \\alpha_s(\\mu_0)/(4\\pi)$ and $\\delta a_0 = \\delta\\alpha_s(\\mu_0)/(4\\pi)$. The $\\beta$-function coefficients $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are calculated based on the given number of active flavors $n_f$.\n\n2.  **Central Value Calculation**: The central value of the observable, $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}}$, is computed using the central value of the initial coupling, $a_0$, and the default theoretical choices: renormalization scales are set to the physical scales ($\\mu_H^{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\mu_H, \\mu_L^{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\mu_L$), which corresponds to scale factors $(f_H, f_L)=(1,1)$, and the scheme parameter is set to $s=0$. This involves evolving $a(\\mu)$ from $\\mu_0$ to $\\mu_H$ and $\\mu_L$ respectively, and then evaluating $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\n3.  **Input Coupling Uncertainty Propagation**: The uncertainty $\\delta a_0$ is propagated to the observable. We compute $\\mathcal{O}$ for initial couplings $a_0 \\pm \\delta a_0$, keeping the scales and scheme at their default central values. This yields $\\mathcal{O}_{+}$ and $\\mathcal{O}_{-}$. The asymmetric uncertainties are then determined as:\n    $$\n    \\Delta^{(a_{0})}_{+} = \\max(\\mathcal{O}_{+} - \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}},\\; \\mathcal{O}_{-} - \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}},\\; 0)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\Delta^{(a_{0})}_{-} = \\max(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}} - \\mathcal{O}_{+},\\; \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}} - \\mathcal{O}_{-},\\; 0)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Scale and Scheme Uncertainty Estimation**: The uncertainty due to the choice of renormalization scales and scheme is estimated by creating an envelope. The observable $\\mathcal{O}$ is calculated for a grid of $7 \\times 3 = 21$ theory choices. The scales $(\\mu_H, \\mu_L)$ are varied by factors $(f_H, f_L)$ drawn from the seven-point set $\\{(1,1), (2,2), (1/2,1/2), (2,1), (1,2), (1/2,1), (1,1/2)\\}$, and for each scale choice, the scheme parameter $s$ is varied over $\\{-s_{\\max}, 0, +s_{\\max}\\}$. The minimum and maximum values of $\\mathcal{O}$ over this entire set, $\\mathcal{O}_{\\min}$ and $\\mathcal{O}_{\\max}$, define the envelope.\n\n5.  **Total Uncertainty Combination**: The two sources of uncertainty are assumed to be independent and are combined in quadrature. The upper and lower uncertainties from scale/scheme variation are taken as $\\max(\\mathcal{O}_{\\max} - \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}}, 0)$ and $\\max(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}} - \\mathcal{O}_{\\min}, 0)$, respectively. The final total uncertainties, $\\Delta_+$ and $\\Delta_-$, are:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_{+} = \\sqrt{ \\max(\\mathcal{O}_{\\max} - \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}}, 0)^{2} + (\\Delta^{(a_{0})}_{+})^{2} }\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\Delta_{-} = \\sqrt{ \\max(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}} - \\mathcal{O}_{\\min}, 0)^{2} + (\\Delta^{(a_{0})}_{-})^{2} }\n    $$\n\nThis systematic procedure is applied to each of the three test cases provided, yielding for each a triplet $[\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{cen}}, \\Delta_{-}, \\Delta_{+}]$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run all test cases and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the 7-point set for scale variation factors\n    f_factors = [\n        (1.0, 1.0), (2.0, 2.0), (0.5, 0.5), (2.0, 1.0),\n        (1.0, 2.0), (0.5, 1.0), (1.0, 0.5)\n    ]\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test A\n        {\n            \"nf\": 5, \"mu0\": 91.1876, \"alphas_mu0\": 0.118, \"delta_alphas_mu0\": 0.0005,\n            \"muH\": 200.0, \"muL\": 20.0,\n            \"C0\": 1.0, \"K1\": 1.2, \"K2\": 0.8, \"Q1\": 0.5, \"Q2\": 0.3, \"Q3\": 0.2,\n            \"s_max\": 1.0, \"f_factors\": f_factors\n        },\n        # Test B\n        {\n            \"nf\": 5, \"mu0\": 91.1876, \"alphas_mu0\": 0.118, \"delta_alphas_mu0\": 0.0005,\n            \"muH\": 1000.0, \"muL\": 5.0,\n            \"C0\": 0.75, \"K1\": 2.0, \"K2\": 1.5, \"Q1\": 1.2, \"Q2\": 0.9, \"Q3\": 0.4,\n            \"s_max\": 1.0, \"f_factors\": f_factors\n        },\n        # Test C\n        {\n            \"nf\": 4, \"mu0\": 10.0, \"alphas_mu0\": 0.18, \"delta_alphas_mu0\": 0.002,\n            \"muH\": 50.0, \"muL\": 2.5,\n            \"C0\": 1.2, \"K1\": 1.0, \"K2\": 1.7, \"Q1\": 0.7, \"Q2\": 0.6, \"Q3\": 0.5,\n            \"s_max\": 0.8, \"f_factors\": f_factors\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case_params in test_cases:\n        result_triplet = compute_triplet(**case_params)\n        results.append(result_triplet)\n\n    # Format the final output string exactly as specified\n    formatted_results = \",\".join(f\"[{r[0]},{r[1]},{r[2]}]\" for r in results)\n    print(f\"[{formatted_results}]\")\n\ndef compute_triplet(nf, mu0, alphas_mu0, delta_alphas_mu0, muH, muL,\n                     C0, K1, K2, Q1, Q2, Q3, s_max, f_factors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the result triplet [O_cen, Delta_-, Delta_+] for a single test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert alpha_s to a = alpha_s / (4*pi)\n    a0 = alphas_mu0 / (4.0 * np.pi)\n    delta_a0 = delta_alphas_mu0 / (4.0 * np.pi)\n\n    # Beta function coefficients for SU(3)\n    beta0 = 11.0 - (2.0 / 3.0) * nf\n    beta1 = 102.0 - (38.0 / 3.0) * nf\n\n    # Define the ODE for the RGE: da/dt = beta(a)\n    def beta_func(t, a):\n        return -beta0 * a**2 - beta1 * a**3\n\n    # Helper function to evolve the coupling 'a' from mu_start to mu_end\n    def evolve_a(a_start, mu_start, mu_end):\n        t_start = np.log(mu_start)\n        t_end = np.log(mu_end)\n        if np.isclose(t_start, t_end):\n            return a_start\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            beta_func, (t_start, t_end), [a_start], \n            method='RK45', rtol=1e-8, atol=1e-10\n        )\n        return sol.y[0, -1]\n\n    # Helper function to calculate the observable O\n    def calculate_O(aH, aL, s):\n        asH = aH + s * aH**2\n        asL = aL + s * aL**2\n        O_val = C0 * (1.0 + K1*asH + K2*asL + Q1*asH**2 + Q2*asL**2 + Q3*asH*asL)\n        return O_val\n\n    # 1.
