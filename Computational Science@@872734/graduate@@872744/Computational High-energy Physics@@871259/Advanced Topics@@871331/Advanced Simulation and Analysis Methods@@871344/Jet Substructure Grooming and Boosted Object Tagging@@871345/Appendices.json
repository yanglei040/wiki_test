The background is treated as a continuous field, where an infinitesimal area element $\\mathrm{d}A$ in the rapidity-azimuth plane carries a transverse momentum $k_{T} = \\rho\\,\\mathrm{d}A$.\n\nThe contribution to the jet's mass-squared from a single soft constituent of transverse momentum $k_{T}$ at an angular distance $r$ from the jet axis (which is aligned with the hard core of momentum $p_T$) is given by the small-angle approximation:\n$$\n\\Delta m^{2} \\simeq p_{T}\\,k_{T}\\,r^{2}\n$$\nTo find the total mass-squared shift from the background, we must integrate the contribution from all infinitesimal background elements that are retained by the grooming algorithm.

Trimming\nThe trimming algorithm reclusters the jet's constituents into subjets of radius $R_{\\text{sub}}$. A subjet is discarded if its transverse momentum $p_{T, \\text{subjet}}$ is less than a fraction $f_{\\text{cut}}$ of the original jet's $p_T$, i.e., if $p_{T, \\text{subjet}}  f_{\\text{cut}} p_{T}$.\n\nWe are given the crucial assumption that $f_{\\text{cut}} p_{T} \\gg \\rho \\,\\pi R_{\\text{sub}}^{2}$. The term $\\rho \\,\\pi R_{\\text{sub}}^{2}$ represents the total transverse momentum of the background contained within a disk of radius $R_{\\text{sub}}$. This is the characteristic momentum of a subjet composed solely of background. The assumption thus implies that any subjet that does not contain the hard core of the original jet will have a transverse momentum $p_{T, \\text{subjet}} \\approx \\rho \\,\\pi R_{\\text{sub}}^{2} \\ll f_{\\text{cut}} p_{T}$, and will consequently be discarded.\n\nConversely, the subjet containing the hard core of momentum $\\sim p_T$ will have a total momentum significantly larger than the cut threshold $f_{\\text{cut}}p_T$ (as $f_{\\text{cut}}$ must be less than $1$ to be non-trivial) and will be retained.\n\nTherefore, the trimming procedure retains exactly one subjet: the one containing the hard core. We make the reasonable approximation that this central hard subjet is centered at $r=0$. The background contamination that contributes to the final groomed jet mass is the background that falls within the area of this single retained subjet.\n\nThe retained area $\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{retained}}$ is a disk of radius $R_{\\text{sub}}$ centered at the origin. We can now calculate the mass-squared shift by integrating over this disk:\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{trim}}^{2} = p_{T}\\,\\rho \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\phi \\int_{0}^{R_{\\text{sub}}} r^{3}\\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe integral over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{trim}}^{2} = 2\\pi p_{T}\\,\\rho \\int_{0}^{R_{\\text{sub}}} r^{3}\\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe integral over $r$ is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{R_{\\text{sub}}} r^{3}\\,\\mathrm{d}r = \\left[ \\frac{r^{4}}{4} \\right]_{0}^{R_{\\text{sub}}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{sub}}^{4}}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we find the mass-squared shift for trimming:\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{trim}}^{2} = 2\\pi p_{T}\\,\\rho \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{sub}}^{4}}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi \\rho p_{T} R_{\\text{sub}}^{4}\n$$\n\n### 2. Modified Mass Drop Tagger (mMDT)\nThe mMDT procedure works by reversing the Cambridge/Aachen (C/A) clustering sequence. At each declustering step, a jet $j$ is split into two subjets, $j_1$ and $j_2$ (with $p_{T1}  p_{T2}$). If the momentum sharing variable $z = \\frac{p_{T2}}{p_{T1} + p_{T2}}$ is less than or equal to a fixed cut $z_{\\text{cut}}$, the softer branch $j_2$ is removed, and the procedure is iterated on $j_1$. The process stops when a split occurs that satisfies $z  z_{\\text{cut}}$.\n\nThe calculation is to be performed at leading power in $\\rho/p_{T}$. This allows us to treat the background momentum density $\\rho$ as a parametrically small quantity. Any contribution to a subjet's momentum that comes entirely from the background will be proportional to $\\rho$.\n\nConsider a declustering step where one branch, say $j_2$, consists entirely of background contamination. Its transverse momentum $p_{T2}$ will be proportional to $\\rho$. The other branch, $j_1$, contains the hard core of the jet, so its momentum $p_{T1}$ is of order $p_T$. The momentum sharing for this split is:\n$$\nz = \\frac{p_{T2}}{p_{T1} + p_{T2}} \\approx \\frac{p_{T2}}{p_{T1}}\n$$\nSince $p_{T2} \\propto \\rho$ and $p_{T1} \\propto p_{T}$ (and is independent of $\\rho$), the sharing variable $z$ is of order $\\rho/p_{T}$.\n\nThe mMDT condition to stop declustering is $z  z_{\\text{cut}}$. Since $z_{\\text{cut}}$ is a fixed, finite number (with $0  z_{\\text{cut}}  1/2$), and we are working at leading (first) power in $\\rho/p_T$, any splitting that separates a pure background component from the hard jet will have a $z$ value that is parametrically smaller than $z_{\\text{cut}}$. Such a split will always fail the condition.\n$$\nz \\sim \\mathcal{O}(\\rho/p_T) \\ll z_{\\text{cut}}\n$$\nTherefore, the softer branch (the background component) will be removed. The C/A declustering process proceeds from large to small angular scales. This means the mMDT algorithm will systematically strip away all soft, wide-angle background contamination from the jet.\n\nThe procedure will only terminate when it encounters a splitting that is internal to the hard process itself (i.e., part of the parton shower that initiated the jet), for which the momenta of both branches are of the order of $p_T$. For such a \"hard\" splitting, $z$ will be a finite number not suppressed by $\\rho/p_T$, and it can satisfy $z  z_{\\text{cut}}$.\n\nAt the point where the algorithm terminates, all branches consisting purely of background have already been identified and removed in the previous declustering steps. The resulting groomed jet, at this leading-power approximation, contains no constituents from the uniform background.\n\nConsequently, the induced shift in the groomed jet mass-squared due to the background is zero.\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{mMDT}}^{2} = 0\n$$\n\nCombining the two results, the final answer is the row vector $\\left(\\Delta m_{\\text{trim}}^{2},\\,\\Delta m_{\\text{mMDT}}^{2}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pmatrix{ \\frac{1}{2} \\pi \\rho p_{T} R_{\\text{sub}}^{4}  0 }}\n$$", "id": "3519346"}, {"introduction": "Having established the need for grooming, we now analyze a groomer's behavior from a theoretical standpoint, connecting it to the underlying physics of particle radiation. The Soft Drop algorithm is particularly powerful because its properties can be calculated directly from the principles of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

The Soft Drop definition uses Cambridge/Aachen reclustering and enforces the condition $z \\equiv \\min(p_{T,1},p_{T,2})/(p_{T,1}+p_{T,2})  z_{\\text{cut}}$ at the first accepted branching; the observable $z_g$ is identified with the $z$ value at that branching.

It poses a standard, solvable problem in the field of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phenomenology, specifically related to jet substructure.\n\nWe are asked to derive the normalized leading-order (LO) probability density function for the Soft Drop (SD) observable $z_g$. The process is a quark-initiated jet groomed with SD using parameters $\\beta = 0$ and $z_{\\text{cut}} = 0.1$.\n\n**1. Fundamental Principles of QCD Splitting**\n\nAt leading order and in the collinear approximation, the differential probability for a quark to emit a gluon, $q(P) \\rightarrow q(p_1) + g(p_2)$, is given by:\n$$\nd\\mathcal{P} = \\frac{2\\alpha_s}{\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\theta} dz' P_{q\\to qg}(z')\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the emission angle relative to the parent quark, $\\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant (assumed fixed, as per the problem statement), and $z'$ is the momentum fraction carried by the emitted gluon, $p_{T,g} = z' p_{T,jet}$. The parent quark splits into a quark with momentum fraction $1-z'$ and a gluon with momentum fraction $z'$. The splitting function for this process is:\n$$\nP_{q\\to qg}(z') = C_F \\frac{1 + (1-z')^2}{z'}\n$$\nwhere $C_F = 4/3$ is the color factor for a quark. Since we seek a normalized distribution, this constant will cancel and we can work with $P_{q\\to qg}(z') \\propto \\frac{1+(1-z')^2}{z'}$. This function is \"unsymmetrized\" as it is singular for soft emissions ($z' \\rightarrow 0$) but regular for hard, collinear emissions ($z' \\rightarrow 1$).\n\n**2. Soft Drop Grooming**\n\nThe Soft Drop procedure reclusters the jet constituents with the Cambridge/Aachen (C/A) algorithm, which generates an angularly ordered history of splittings. For each splitting, it checks the condition:\n$$\nz \\equiv \\frac{\\min(p_{T,1}, p_{T,2})}{p_{T,1} + p_{T,2}}  z_{\\text{cut}}\n$$\nWith $\\beta=0$, the angular dependence of the condition is removed. The observable $z_g$ is the value of $z$ for the first branching (starting from the widest angle and moving inwards) that satisfies this condition.\n\nIn our $q \\to qg$ splitting, the transverse momenta of the two subjets are $p_{T,1} = (1-z')p_{T,jet}$ and $p_{T,2} = z'p_{T,jet}$. The Soft Drop variable $z$ is therefore:\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\min((1-z')p_{T,jet}, z'p_{T,jet})}{(1-z')p_{T,jet} + z'p_{T,jet}} = \\min(1-z', z')\n$$\nThe Soft Drop condition becomes $\\min(1-z', z')  z_{\\text{cut}}$. This inequality holds if and only if $z'  z_{\\text{cut}}$ and $1-z'  z_{\\text{cut}}$, which restricts the momentum fraction $z'$ to the range $z_{\\text{cut}}  z'  1 - z_{\\text{cut}}$. The observable $z_g$ is the value of $\\min(1-z', z')$ for the first splitting that passes this test.\n\n**3. Derivation of the $z_g$ Distribution**\n\nThe probability of having an emission that passes the SD cut depends on both the angle $\\theta$ and the momentum fraction $z'$. However, since the splitting probability factorizes into an angle-dependent part and a $z'$-dependent part, and since $\\alpha_s$ is constant, the Sudakov form factor (the no-emission probability) does not alter the shape of the momentum sharing distribution. The normalized probability density for the underlying splitting variable $z'$, let's call it $f_{Z'}(z')$, for the first emission that passes the cut is simply the splitting function itself, restricted to the allowed range and normalized:\n$$\nf_{Z'}(z') = \\frac{P_{q\\to qg}(z')}{\\int_{z_{\\text{cut}}}^{1-z_{\\text{cut}}} P_{q\\to qg}(x) dx}, \\quad z' \\in (z_{\\text{cut}}, 1-z_{\\text{cut}})\n$$\n\nThe observable is $z_g = \\min(z', 1-z')$. The physical support for $z_g$ is the interval $[z_{\\text{cut}}, 1/2]$. For any given value of $z_g$ in this range, it could have been produced by two distinct values of the underlying splitting variable: $z' = z_g$ or $z' = 1-z_g$. Both of these values lie within the allowed range $(z_{\\text{cut}}, 1-z_{\\text{cut}})$.\n\nThe probability density for $z_g$, let's call it $p(z_g)$, is obtained by summing the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive underlying configurations:\n$$\np(z_g) \\propto f_{Z'}(z'=z_g) + f_{Z'}(z'=1-z_g) \\propto P_{q\\to qg}(z_g) + P_{q\\to qg}(1-z_g)\n$$\nSubstituting the form of the splitting function, the un-normalized distribution is:\n$$\np_{\\text{un-norm}}(z_g) = \\frac{1+(1-z_g)^2}{z_g} + \\frac{1+(1-(1-z_g))^2}{1-z_g} = \\frac{1+(1-z_g)^2}{z_g} + \\frac{1+z_g^2}{1-z_g}\n$$\nThis explains the relation to the unsymmetrized splitting function: the distribution of the symmetrized observable $z_g$ is given by a \"symmetrized\" splitting function, constructed by summing the unsymmetrized function $P_{q\\to qg}(z)$ evaluated at $z=z_g$ and $z=1-z_g$.\n\nTo find the normalized distribution, we must integrate this expression over the physical support of $z_g$, which is $[z_{\\text{cut}}, 1/2]$. The normalization constant $N$ is:\n$$\nN = \\int_{z_{\\text{cut}}}^{1/2} \\left[ \\frac{1+(1-z)^2}{z} + \\frac{1+z^2}{1-z} \\right] dz\n$$\nLet's simplify the integrand:\n$$\n\\frac{1+(1-z)^2}{z} + \\frac{1+z^2}{1-z} = \\frac{2-2z+z^2}{z} + \\frac{1+z^2}{1-z}\n$$\nUsing partial fractions, the integrand simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{z}+\\frac{2}{1-z}-3\n$$\nThe indefinite integral is $2\\ln(z) - 2\\ln(1-z) - 3z$.

The contribution is $p_{T,B} \\times 0 = 0$.\n- For constituent $S$: The distances to the axes must be calculated.\n    - $\\Delta R_{S,J_A} = \\sqrt{(y_S - y_A)^2 + (\\phi_S - \\phi_A)^2} = \\sqrt{(0.02 - 0)^2 + (0.05 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{0.0004 + 0.0025} = \\sqrt{0.0029}$.\n    - $\\Delta R_{S,J_B} = \\sqrt{(y_S - y_B)^2 + (\\phi_S - \\phi_B)^2} = \\sqrt{(0.02 - 0)^2 + (0.05 - 0.2)^2} = \\sqrt{(0.02)^2 + (-0.15)^2} = \\sqrt{0.0004 + 0.0225} = \\sqrt{0.0229}$.\nSince $0.0029  0.0229$, the minimum distance is $\\min\\{\\Delta R_{S,J_A}, \\Delta R_{S,J_B}\\} = \\sqrt{0.0029}$. The contribution is $p_{T,S} \\times \\sqrt{0.0029} = 10\\sqrt{0.0029}$.\n\nSumming the contributions and normalizing:\n$$\n\\tau_{2}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{400} (0 + 0 + 10\\sqrt{0.0029}) = \\frac{10\\sqrt{0.0029}}{400} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.0029}}{40}\n$$\nTo obtain an exact closed-form expression, we simplify the radical:\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.0029} = \\sqrt{29 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\sqrt{29} \\times 10^{-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{100}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\tau_{2}^{(1)}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{2}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{40} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{100} \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{4000}\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of $\\tau_{21} = \\tau_{2}^{(1)}/\\tau_{1}^{(1)}$**\n\nFirst, we must determine $\\tau_{1}^{(1)}$. This requires finding a single axis $J_1=(y_{J_1}, \\phi_{J_1})$ that minimizes the quantity $\\sum_{i} p_{T,i} \\Delta R_{i,J_1}$. This minimum axis corresponds to the geometric median of the constituents in the $(y, \\phi)$ plane, weighted by their $p_T$.\nA property of the geometric median is that it coincides with one of the constituent locations (vertices) $k$ if the magnitude of the vector sum of weighted unit vectors from $k$ to all other constituents $j$ is less than or equal to the weight of constituent $k$. Let $v_i = (y_i, \\phi_i)$ be the position vector of constituent $i$. The condition for the median to be at constituent $A$ is:\n$$\n\\left\\| p_{T,B} \\frac{v_B - v_A}{\\|v_B - v_A\\|} + p_{T,S} \\frac{v_S - v_A}{\\|v_S - v_A\\|} \\right\\| \\le p_{T,A}\n$$\nLet us compute the vector sum on the left-hand side.\n$v_A = (0,0)$, $v_B = (0, 0.2)$, $v_S = (0.02, 0.05)$.\n$v_B-v_A = (0, 0.2)$ and $\\|v_B - v_A\\| = 0.2$.\n$v_S-v_A = (0.02, 0.05)$ and $\\|v_S - v_A\\| = \\sqrt{0.02^2+0.05^2} = \\sqrt{0.0029}$.\nThe vector sum $V$ is:\n$$\nV = 230 \\frac{(0, 0.2)}{0.2} + 10 \\frac{(0.02, 0.05)}{\\sqrt{0.0029}} = (0, 230) + \\left(\\frac{0.2}{\\sqrt{0.0029}}, \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{0.0029}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV = \\left(\\frac{0.2}{\\sqrt{0.0029}}, 230 + \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{0.0029}}\\right)\n$$\nThe squared magnitude of this vector is:\n$$\n\\|V\\|^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.2}{\\sqrt{0.0029}}\\right)^2 + \\left(230 + \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{0.0029}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{0.04}{0.0029} + 230^2 + 2(230)\\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{0.0029}} + \\frac{0.25}{0.0029}\n$$\n$$\n\\|V\\|^2 = 52900 + \\frac{0.04+0.25}{0.0029} + \\frac{230}{\\sqrt{0.0029}} = 52900 + \\frac{0.29}{0.0029} + \\frac{230}{\\sqrt{0.0029}}\n$$\n$$\n\\|V\\|^2 = 52900 + 100 + \\frac{230}{\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{100}} = 53000 + \\frac{23000}{\\sqrt{29}}\n$$\nWe must compare $\\|V\\|$ to $p_{T,A}=260$. Equivalently, we compare $\\|V\\|^2$ to $p_{T,A}^2 = 260^2=67600$.\nThe condition is $53000 + \\frac{23000}{\\sqrt{29}} \\le 67600$.\n$$\n\\frac{23000}{\\sqrt{29}} \\le 14600 \\implies 23000 \\le 14600\\sqrt{29} \\implies \\frac{230}{146} \\le \\sqrt{29}\n$$\nSince $5^2=25$ and $6^2=36$, we have $\\sqrt{29} > 5$. The fraction $\\frac{230}{146} \\approx 1.575$. The inequality $1.575 \\le \\sqrt{29}$ is clearly satisfied.\nThus, the optimal axis for $\\tau_1^{(1)}$ is the axis of the most energetic constituent, $A$, located at $(0,0)$.\n\nWith the optimal axis $J_1$ at $(0,0)$, we can compute $\\tau_{1}^{(1)}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{1}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{d_0} \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,B,S\\}} p_{T,i} \\Delta R_{i,A} = \\frac{1}{400}\\left(p_{T,A}\\Delta R_{A,A} + p_{T,B}\\Delta R_{B,A} + p_{T,S}\\Delta R_{S,A}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{1}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{400}\\left(260(0) + 230(0.2) + 10\\sqrt{0.0029}\\right) = \\frac{46 + 10\\sqrt{0.0029}}{400}\n$$\nNow we can compute the ratio $\\tau_{21}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{21} = \\frac{\\tau_{2}^{(1)}}{\\tau_{1}^{(1)}} = \\frac{\\frac{10\\sqrt{0.0029}}{400}}{\\frac{46 + 10\\sqrt{0.0029}}{400}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{0.0029}}{46 + 10\\sqrt{0.0029}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sqrt{0.0029} = \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{100}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{21} = \\frac{10\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{100}\\right)}{46 + 10\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{100}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{10}}{46 + \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{10}}\n$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $10$:\n$$\n\\tau_{21} = \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{460 + \\sqrt{29}}\n$$\nThe two requested values are $\\tau_{2}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{4000}$ and $\\tau_{21} = \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{460 + \\sqrt{29}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{4000}  \\frac{\\sqrt{29}}{460 + \\sqrt{29}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3519345"}]}
