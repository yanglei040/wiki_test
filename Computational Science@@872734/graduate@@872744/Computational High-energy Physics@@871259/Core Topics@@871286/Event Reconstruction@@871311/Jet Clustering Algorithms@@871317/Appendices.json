It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe fundamental quantity defining proximity between particles in angular-based jet clustering algorithms is the separation in rapidity-azimuth space, denoted by $\\Delta R$. It is defined as the Euclidean distance in the $(y, \\phi)$ plane:\n$$\n\\Delta R = \\sqrt{(\\Delta y)^2 + (\\Delta \\phi)^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta y$ is the difference in rapidity and $\\Delta \\phi$ is the minimal difference in the azimuthal angle, accounting for its periodic nature.\n\nFirst, we compute the difference in rapidity, $\\Delta y$. Given the rapidities $y_{A} = 1.35$ and $y_{B} = 0.95$, the difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta y = y_{A} - y_{B} = 1.35 - 0.95 = 0.40\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the minimal separation in the azimuthal angle, $\\Delta \\phi$. The azimuthal angle $\\phi$ is a periodic coordinate with a period of $2\\pi$, meaning $\\phi$ is equivalent to $\\phi + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. We are given $\\phi_{A} = 3.00$ radians and $\\phi_{B} = -2.90$ radians. The simple difference is:\n$$\n\\delta\\phi = \\phi_{A} - \\phi_{B} = 3.00 - (-2.90) = 5.90 \\text{ radians}\n$$\nThe minimal angular separation $\\Delta \\phi$ must lie in the interval $[0, \\pi]$. Since our calculated difference $\\delta\\phi = 5.90$ is greater than $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we must consider the shorter path around the circle. The separation along the shorter arc is given by $2\\pi - |\\delta\\phi|$ if $|\\delta\\phi| > \\pi$. In this case, the minimal separation is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi - 5.90\n$$\nNumerically, this is approximately $\\Delta\\phi \\approx 6.283185 - 5.90 = 0.383185$ radians. Since this value is less than $\\pi$, it is the correct minimal separation.\n\nNow, we can compute the total rapidity-azimuth separation $\\Delta R$:\n$$\n\\Delta R = \\sqrt{(\\Delta y)^2 + (\\Delta \\phi)^2} = \\sqrt{(0.40)^2 + (2\\pi - 5.90)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n(\\Delta y)^2 = (0.40)^2 = 0.16\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta \\phi)^2 \\approx (0.383185)^2 \\approx 0.14683\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta R)^2 = (\\Delta y)^2 + (\\Delta \\phi)^2 \\approx 0.16 + 0.14683 = 0.30683\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta R = \\sqrt{0.30683} \\approx 0.5539228\n$$\nThe problem requires the final value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta R \\approx 0.5539\n$$\n\nFinally, we assess whether these two particles would be considered \"nearby\" for a jet radius parameter of $R = 0.4$. A pair of particles is considered close if their separation $\\Delta R$ is less than the jet radius $R$. In this case:\n$$\n\\Delta R \\approx 0.5539\n$$\nComparing this to the jet radius $R = 0.4$:\n$$\n0.5539 > 0.4\n$$\nSince $\\Delta R > R$, the particles $A$ and $B$ would not be considered \"nearby\" in the context of clustering with this jet radius.

The anti-$k_t$ algorithm is a member of the sequential recombination family of jet algorithms. These algorithms iteratively cluster particles based on a distance measure. For any pair of particles $i$ and $j$, a pair distance $d_{ij}$ is defined, and for each particle $i$, a beam distance $d_{iB}$ is defined. The general forms of these distances, parameterized by a number $p$ and a radius parameter $R$, are:\n$$d_{ij} = \\min(p_{T,i}^{2p}, p_{T,j}^{2p}) \\frac{\\Delta R_{ij}^2}{R^2}$$\n$$d_{iB} = p_{T,i}^{2p}$$\nwhere $p_{T,i}$ is the transverse momentum of particle $i$, and $\\Delta R_{ij} = \\sqrt{(y_i - y_j)^2 + (\\phi_i - \\phi_j)^2}$ is the distance in the rapidity–azimuthal angle plane.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Calculate all distances $d_{ij}$ and $d_{iB}$ for all particles in the event.\n2. Find the minimum of all these distances, $d_{\\min}$.\n3. If $d_{\\min}$ is a pair distance $d_{ij}$, particles $i$ and $j$ are merged into a single new pseudo-particle according to a specific recombination scheme (typically adding their four-momenta). The original particles $i$ and $j$ are removed from the list.\n4. If $d_{\\min}$ is a beam distance $d_{iB}$, particle $i$ is declared a final-state jet and is removed from the list of particles.\n5. The process is repeated until no particles remain.\n\nThe anti-$k_t$ algorithm corresponds to the choice $p = -1$. With this choice, the distances become:\n$$d_{ij} = \\min(p_{T,i}^{-2}, p_{T,j}^{-2}) \\frac{\\Delta R_{ij}^2}{R^2} = \\frac{1}{\\max(p_{T,i}^{2}, p_{T,j}^{2})} \\frac{\\Delta R_{ij}^2}{R^2}$$\n$$d_{iB} = p_{T,i}^{-2}$$\n\nA key feature of the anti-$k_t$ algorithm emerges from these definitions. The distances are inversely proportional to powers of transverse momentum. This means that particles with high $p_T$ have small distances. Consequently, the algorithm tends to merge soft particles with hard particles before it merges soft particles with each other. This makes hard particles act as \"seeds\" that accrete nearby soft radiation.\n\nLet us analyze the condition under which a soft particle $s$ merges with a hard particle $h$ ($p_{T,h} \\gg p_{T,s}$). The relevant distances are the pair distance $d_{hs}$ and the beam distance of the hard particle $d_{hB}$. The merger will occur if $d_{hs}$ is the minimum distance in the event. Let's compare $d_{hs}$ to $d_{hB}$:\n$$d_{hs} = \\frac{1}{\\max(p_{T,h}^2, p_{T,s}^2)} \\frac{\\Delta R_{hs}^2}{R^2} = \\frac{1}{p_{T,h}^2} \\frac{\\Delta R_{hs}^2}{R^2}$$\n$$d_{hB} = \\frac{1}{p_{T,h}^2}$$\nThe condition for the hard particle to accrete a neighbor rather than being declared a jet is $d_{hs}  d_{hB}$, which simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{1}{p_{T,h}^2} \\frac{\\Delta R_{hs}^2}{R^2}  \\frac{1}{p_{T,h}^2} \\implies \\frac{\\Delta R_{hs}^2}{R^2}  1 \\implies \\Delta R_{hs}  R$$\nThis demonstrates that a hard particle $h$ will accrete any particle within a cone of radius $R$ around it. The resulting jet shape is therefore a perfect circle in the $(y, \\phi)$ plane, centered on the hard seed. This is why the anti-$k_t$ algorithm is said to produce \"cone-like\" jets whose boundaries are insensitive to the distribution of soft radiation, a property crucial for many physics analyses.\n\nIn this problem, we have two hard particles: $h_1$ with $p_{T,1}=200~\\mathrm{GeV}$ at $(y_1,\\phi_1) = (0,0)$ and $h_2$ with $p_{T,2}=180~\\mathrm{GeV}$ at $(y_2,\\phi_2) = (0,0.8)$. The radius parameter is $R=0.4$. The separation between them is $\\Delta R_{12} = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (0.8-0)^2} = 0.8$, which is exactly $2R$.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, $h_1$ defines a circular catchment area of radius $R=0.4$ centered at $(0,0)$, and $h_2$ defines another circular catchment area of radius $R=0.4$ centered at $(0,0.8)$. Since their separation is $2R$, these two circular areas are perfectly tangent to each other at the point $(y,\\phi)=(0,0.4)$ and do not overlap.\n\nTherefore, any soft particle will be clustered with the hard particle to which it is geometrically closer. The decision boundary for assigning a soft particle at $(y_s, \\phi_s)$ is the set of points equidistant from $h_1$ and $h_2$.\n$$\\Delta R_{s,1} = \\Delta R_{s,2}$$\n$$\\sqrt{(y_s - y_1)^2 + (\\phi_s - \\phi_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(y_s - y_2)^2 + (\\phi_s - \\phi_2)^2}$$\n$$\\sqrt{y_s^2 + \\phi_s^2} = \\sqrt{y_s^2 + (\\phi_s - 0.8)^2}$$\nSquaring both sides and simplifying:\n$$y_s^2 + \\phi_s^2 = y_s^2 + (\\phi_s - 0.8)^2$$\n$$\\phi_s^2 = \\phi_s^2 - 1.6\\phi_s + 0.64$$\n$$1.6\\phi_s = 0.64 \\implies \\phi_s = \\frac{0.64}{1.6} = 0.4$$\nThe decision boundary is the line $\\phi = 0.4$. A soft particle $s_i$ is assigned to jet 1 (seeded by $h_1$) if its azimuthal angle $\\phi_i  0.4$, and to jet 2 (seeded by $h_2$) if $\\phi_i > 0.4$.\n\nWe now apply this criterion to each soft particle:\n- $s_1$: $(y,\\phi) = (0.3, 0.05)$. Since $\\phi_{s1}=0.05  0.4$, it is assigned to jet 1.\n- $s_2$: $(y,\\phi) = (0.1, 0.45)$. Since $\\phi_{s2}=0.45 > 0.4$, it is assigned to jet 2.\n- $s_3$: $(y,\\phi) = (0.0, 0.39)$. Since $\\phi_{s3}=0.39  0.4$, it is assigned to jet 1.\n- $s_4$: $(y,\\phi) = (-0.2, 0.6)$. Since $\\phi_{s4}=0.6 > 0.4$, it is assigned to jet 2.\n- $s_5$: $(y,\\phi) = (0.0, 0.41)$. Since $\\phi_{s5}=0.41 > 0.4$, it is assigned to jet 2.\n- $s_6$: $(y,\\phi) = (0.0, 0.8)$. Since $\\phi_{s6}=0.8 > 0.4$, it is assigned to jet 2.\n\nThe final assignment for soft particles ($s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, s_6$) is (jet 1, jet 2, jet 1, jet 2, jet 2, jet 2).
