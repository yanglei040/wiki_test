The description of particle interaction probability using a constant macroscopic cross section ($\\mu$) is a standard physical model. This leads directly to a Poisson process for the number of interactions over a given path length and, consequently, an exponential distribution for the free path length between interactions. The relation $\\mu = n \\sigma$ is a definitional identity in material science and particle physics.

The data values are physically plausible for condensed matter and radiation interactions. The edge cases for the uniform variates ($u$ close to $0$ and $u$ close to $1$) are well-chosen to test the numerical behavior of the sampling formula at its limits, which is a hallmark of a well-designed computational problem.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a sampling method for the free path length, $\\ell$, of a particle in a homogeneous medium. The underlying physical model is a Poisson process governing the interactions.\n\n$1$. **Probability Distribution of Free Path Length**\nThe macroscopic interaction coefficient, $\\mu$, represents the constant probability per unit path length for a particle to interact. For a particle that has traveled a distance $x$, the probability of it interacting in the next infinitesimal interval $dx$ is $\\mu dx$. The probability of it *not* interacting in this interval is $1 - \\mu dx$.\n\nThe probability $P(x)$ that a particle travels at least a distance $x$ without an interaction (the survival probability) can be found by considering the path as a series of infinitesimal steps. The probability of surviving to $x+dx$ is the product of the probability of surviving to $x$ and the probability of not interacting in $dx$:\n$$ P(x+dx) = P(x) (1 - \\mu dx) $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ \\frac{P(x+dx) - P(x)}{dx} = - \\mu P(x) $$\nTaking the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we get the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dP(x)}{dx} = - \\mu P(x) $$\nWith the boundary condition that the survival probability at distance $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $P(0)=1$), the solution to this equation is the exponential decay function:\n$$ P(x) = e^{-\\mu x} $$\nThis function is also known as the survival function, $S(x)$.\n\nThe random variable of interest is the path length $\\ell$ to the *first* interaction. The cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(\\ell)$, gives the probability that the interaction occurs at a path length less than or equal to $\\ell$. This is equivalent to $1$ minus the probability of surviving beyond length $\\ell$:\n$$ F(\\ell) = 1 - S(\\ell) = 1 - e^{-\\mu \\ell} $$\nThe probability density function (PDF), $p(\\ell)$, is the derivative of the CDF:\n$$ p(\\ell) = \\frac{dF(\\ell)}{d\\ell} = \\mu e^{-\\mu \\ell}, \\quad \\text{for } \\ell \\ge 0 $$\nThis is the exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\mu$. The mean of this distribution is indeed $1/\\mu$, which is consistent with the definition of the mean free path, $\\lambda$.\n\n$2$. **Inverse Transform Sampling**\nThe inverse transform sampling method is a procedure to generate random samples from any probability distribution for which the inverse of its CDF is known. The method works by generating a random number $u$ from a standard uniform distribution on the interval $(0, 1)$ and then computing the sample $\\ell$ as:\n$$ \\ell = F^{-1}(u) $$\nwhere $F^{-1}$ is the inverse of the CDF.\n\nTo find $F^{-1}$, we set $F(\\ell) = u$ and solve for $\\ell$:\n$$ u = 1 - e^{-\\mu \\ell} $$\n$$ e^{-\\mu \\ell} = 1 - u $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(e^{-\\mu \\ell}) = \\ln(1 - u) $$\n$$ -\\mu \\ell = \\ln(1 - u) $$\n$$ \\ell = -\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\ln(1 - u) $$\nSince the mean free path is defined as $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, the sampling formula becomes:\n$$ \\ell = -\\lambda \\ln(1 - u) $$\nA common and equivalent simplification is based on the property that if $u$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $(0, 1)$, then the random variable $u' = 1 - u$ is also uniformly distributed on $(0, 1)$. Therefore, we can substitute $u$ for $1 - u$ in the formula, yielding the more direct expression:\n$$ \\ell = -\\lambda \\ln(u) $$\nThis form is widely used in Monte Carlo simulations for its simplicity and direct connection to the survival function ($S(\\ell) = u$). We will use this form for the computations.\n\n$3$. **Computational Algorithm**\nFor each test case given by the tuple $(n, \\sigma, u_1, u_2)$:\na. Calculate the macroscopic interaction coefficient: $\\mu = n \\sigma$.\nb. Calculate the mean free path: $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$.\nc.

The mean number of photoelectrons, $\\langle n \\rangle$, for a given shower is therefore:\n$$\n\\langle n \\rangle = N_{pe} E_{\\text{scint}} = N_{pe} f_s E\n$$\nThe problem states that photoelectron production follows a Poisson process. A fundamental property of the Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean. Thus, the variance of the number of photoelectrons, $\\sigma_n^2$, is:\n$$\n\\sigma_n^2 = \\langle n \\rangle = N_{pe} f_s E\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the photoelectron count is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_n = \\sqrt{N_{pe} f_s E}\n$$\nThe energy estimator, $\\hat{E}$, is constructed from the measured number of photoelectrons, $n$. It is specified to be linear and unbiased. Let the estimator have the form $\\hat{E} = C \\cdot n$, where $C$ is a calibration constant. The unbiased condition requires that the expectation value of the estimator equals the true energy, $\\langle \\hat{E} \\rangle = E$.\n$$\n\\langle \\hat{E} \\rangle = \\langle C \\cdot n \\rangle = C \\langle n \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\langle n \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\hat{E} \\rangle = C (N_{pe} f_s E)\n$$\nFor this to be unbiased, we must have $C (N_{pe} f_s E) = E$, which gives the calibration constant as:\n$$\nC = \\frac{1}{N_{pe} f_s}\n$$\nThe estimator for the total energy is thus $\\hat{E} = \\frac{n}{N_{pe} f_s}$.
