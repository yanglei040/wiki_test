The bond connecting them is modeled as a spring with a force constant $k$. The potential energy $U$ of the system is a function of the internuclear displacement from equilibrium. Let the equilibrium bond length be $x_{eq}$. The internuclear distance is $r = x_2 - x_1$. The displacement from equilibrium is $x = r - x_{eq} = (x_2 - x_1) - x_{eq}$.

Conventionally, $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is expressed in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nThe wavelength and linear frequency are related by the speed of light, $c$: $c = \\lambda\\nu$.\nFrom this, we can express linear frequency as $\\nu = c/\\lambda = c\\tilde{\\nu}$.\nTo maintain unit consistency with $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, the speed of light $c$ must be expressed in $\\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu$ into the equation for $\\omega$:\n$\\omega = 2\\pi c \\tilde{\\nu}$\nCombining this with the result from Step 1, we obtain a direct relationship between the observable wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ and the molecular parameters $k$ and $\\mu$:\n$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi c} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$\n\nStep 3: Calculation of the wavenumber for $^{13}\\mathrm{C=O}$.\n\nThe problem states that the force constant $k$ is assumed to be unchanged by isotopic substitution.

It consists of three parts: a derivation of the Beer-Lambert law, a calculation of concentration using this law, and a conceptual explanation of the limitations of this law in the context of infrared spectroscopy.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Absorbance-Concentration Relation\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the linear relationship between absorbance and concentration, starting from two fundamental points: the definition of decadic absorbance and the law of exponential attenuation.\n\n1.  **Exponential Attenuation**: The attenuation of a monochromatic plane wave passing through a uniform absorbing medium is described by the exponential decay of its intensity, $I$. Let $I_0$ be the incident intensity at the front of the sample ($x=0$) and $I_t$ be the transmitted intensity after passing through a pathlength $b$. The relationship is given by:\n    $$I_t = I_0 \\exp(-k b)$$\n    In an absorbing solution, the attenuation coefficient $k$ is found to be proportional to the concentration $c$ of the absorbing species. We can thus write $k = \\alpha_e c$, where $\\alpha_e$ is the Napierian molar absorptivity, a constant characteristic of the absorbing species at a specific frequency. The equation becomes:\n    $$I_t = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha_e c b)$$\n\n2.  **Transmittance**: Transmittance, $T$, is defined as the fraction of the incident intensity that is transmitted through the sample:\n    $$T = \\frac{I_t}{I_0}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $I_t$ from step 1 gives:\n    $$T = \\frac{I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha_e c b)}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\alpha_e c b)$$\n\n3.  **Decadic Absorbance**: Decadic absorbance, $A$, is defined as the base-$10$ logarithm of the reciprocal of the transmittance:\n    $$A = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) = -\\log_{10}(T)$$\n\n4.  **Connecting Absorbance and Concentration**: We substitute the expression for $T$ from step 2 into the definition of $A$:\n    $$A = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\exp(-\\alpha_e c b)\\right)$$\n    Using the logarithm property $\\log_x(y^z) = z \\log_x(y)$, we can bring the exponent down:\n    $$A = -(-\\alpha_e c b) \\log_{10}(e) = (\\alpha_e c b) \\log_{10}(e)$$\n    The term $\\log_{10}(e)$ is a constant conversion factor between the natural logarithm (base $e$) and the decadic logarithm (base $10$). Its value is $\\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$.\n    $$A = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_e}{\\ln(10)}\\right) b c$$\n\n5.  **The Beer-Lambert Law**: The term in the parenthesis is a constant for a given substance, solvent, temperature, and frequency. It is defined as the decadic molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon$:\n    $$\\epsilon = \\frac{\\alpha_e}{\\ln(10)}$$\n    By substituting this definition, we arrive at the linear relationship known as the Beer-Lambert law:\n    $$A = \\epsilon b c$$\n    This equation shows that for a non-interacting solution, under conditions where $\\epsilon$ is constant, the absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration $c$ and the pathlength $b$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Solute Concentration\n\nWe use the derived Beer-Lambert law, $A = \\epsilon b c$, to calculate the concentration $c$.\nFirst, rearrange the equation to solve for $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon b}$$\nThe given values are:\n-   Decadic absorbance, $A = 0.500$ (dimensionless).\n-   Decadic molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon = 320 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n-   Cell pathlength, $b = 0.1 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nThe units of pathlength in $\\epsilon$ and $b$ are different. We must convert the pathlength $b$ from millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$) to centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$):\n$$b = 0.1 \\text{ mm} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ cm}}{10 \\text{ mm}} = 0.01 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nNow, substitute the numerical values into the equation for $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{0.500}{(320 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ cm}^{-1}) \\times (0.01 \\text{ cm})}$$\n$$c = \\frac{0.500}{3.20} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$$\n$$c = 0.15625 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$c \\approx 0.1563 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$$\n\n### Part 3: Conditions for Non-Linearity\n\nThe linear relationship $A = \\epsilon b c$ is a limiting law and can fail under certain conditions. Deviations from linearity can be categorized into fundamental/chemical reasons and instrumental limitations.\n\n**1. Fundamental and Chemical Deviations:** These arise because the molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon$, is not truly independent of concentration.\n-   **High Concentrations**: The Beer-Lambert law assumes that absorbing molecules are independent and do not interact with each other. At high concentrations (typically $> 0.01 \\text{ M}$), solute molecules are closer together, leading to intermolecular interactions such as self-association, dimerization (e.g., via dipole-dipole forces for carbonyl groups), or changes in the solvation shell. These interactions perturb the vibrational energy levels of the molecules, which in turn alters the molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon$. Since the extent of these interactions is concentration-dependent, $\\epsilon$ becomes a function of concentration, causing the plot of $A$ versus $c$ to become non-linear. The problem specifies that $\\epsilon$ was determined for the \"non-interacting monomer,\" highlighting that any such interactions in the sample will cause a deviation.\n-   **Chemical Equilibria**: If the absorbing species participates in a concentration-dependent chemical equilibrium (e.g., acid-base, complexation, or association/dissociation), the concentration of the specific species being monitored by the spectrometer may not be linearly proportional to the total stoichiometric concentration of the solute. This leads to a non-linear relationship between measured absorbance and the total concentration.\n\n**2. Instrumental Deviations:** These are rooted in the physical limitations of the spectrometer.\n-   **Polychromatic Radiation**: The Beer-Lambert law is strictly valid only for monochromatic radiation (light of a single frequency). Real infrared spectrometers use a source and monochromator (or an interferometer in FT-IR) that pass a finite range of frequencies, defined by the spectral bandpass. If the molar absorptivity $\\epsilon$ varies across this frequency range (which it does, especially near the maximum of an absorption band), the linear relationship breaks down. The detector measures an intensity that is an average over the bandpass. This results in the measured absorbance being lower than the true peak absorbance, with the deviation becoming more severe at higher absorbances, leading to a negative curvature in the calibration plot.\n-   **Stray Light**: Stray light is any extraneous radiation that reaches the detector without having passed through the sample in the intended path. It can originate from scattering within the instrument or leaks in the instrument housing. Let its intensity be $I_s$. The detector measures a total intensity of $I_t + I_s$ for the sample and $I_0 + I_s$ for the reference. The apparent absorbance is then $A' = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0 + I_s}{I_t + I_s}\\right)$. As concentration increases, $I_t$ decreases towards zero, and the apparent absorbance $A'$ approaches a limiting value of $\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0+I_s}{I_s}\\right)$ instead of increasing indefinitely. This effect is most significant at high absorbances (typically $A > 2$) and causes a pronounced negative deviation from linearity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1563}$$", "id": "3718803"}]}
