This exercise delves into the fundamental principle governing this broadband excitation—the Fourier transform relationship between the pulse duration in the time domain and the resulting excitation profile in the frequency domain.

The analysis is performed in the rotating frame, where frequencies are offsets from the carrier Larmor frequency.\n\nFirst, we derive the functional form of the excitation profile, which is the Fourier transform of the pulse time-domain envelope.
