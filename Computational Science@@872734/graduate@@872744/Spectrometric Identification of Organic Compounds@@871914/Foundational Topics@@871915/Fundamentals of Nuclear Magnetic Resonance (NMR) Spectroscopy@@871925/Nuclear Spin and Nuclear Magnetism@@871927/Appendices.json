As stated in the problem, these two vector quantities are directly proportional, related by the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{L}\n$$\nWhen this magnetic dipole is placed in an external static magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{0}$, it experiences a torque, $\\vec{\\tau}$, given by the cross product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field vector:\n$$\n\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{\\mu} \\times \\vec{B}_{0}\n$$\nAccording to classical mechanics, the torque exerted on a body is equal to the time rate of change of its angular momentum:\n$$\n\\vec{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}\n$$\nBy equating these two expressions for the torque, we obtain the equation of motion for the angular momentum vector in the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\vec{\\mu} \\times \\vec{B}_{0}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship $\\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{L}$ into this equation of motion:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = (\\gamma \\vec{L}) \\times \\vec{B}_{0}\n$$\nSince the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ is a scalar quantity, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\gamma (\\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B}_{0})\n$$\nThis differential equation describes the motion of the angular momentum vector $\\vec{L}$. The vector derivative $d\\vec{L}/dt$ is perpendicular to both $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{B}_{0}$, which implies that the magnitude of $\\vec{L}$ and its component along $\\vec{B}_{0}$ are constant. The vector $\\vec{L}$ therefore rotates, or precesses, around the axis defined by the external magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{0}$.\n\nTo find the frequency of this precession, we compare this equation to the general equation for a vector $\\vec{A}$ precessing with an angular velocity vector $\\vec{\\omega}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{A}}{dt} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{A}\n$$\nTo match this form, we use the anti-commutative property of the cross product, $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = -(\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a})$, on our equation of motion:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = -\\gamma (\\vec{B}_{0} \\times \\vec{L})\n$$\nBy direct comparison with the general precession equation, we can identify the angular velocity vector of precession, $\\vec{\\omega}_{0}$, as:\n$$\n\\vec{\\omega}_{0} = -\\gamma \\vec{B}_{0}\n$$\nThis vector is known as the Larmor frequency vector.

The high-field secular approximation retains only the terms that commute with the main Zeeman Hamiltonian, which is dominated by the $z$-components of the spin operators.
