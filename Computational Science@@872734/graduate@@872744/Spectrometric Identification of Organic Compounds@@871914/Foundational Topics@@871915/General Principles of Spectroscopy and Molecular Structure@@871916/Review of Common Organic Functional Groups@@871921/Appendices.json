The CHN elemental analysis explicitly states that no nitrogen was detected. Therefore, this candidate is inconsistent with the elemental analysis data and is rejected.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$**\n    This composition contains $c=10$ carbon atoms, $h=12$ hydrogen atoms, and $o=2$ oxygen atoms.\n    - **Isotope Ratio ($M+1$):** The number of carbon atoms, $N_C$, can be estimated from the $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ ratio using the rule of thirteen: $N_C \\approx \\frac{I_{M+1}/I_{M}}{A(^{13}\\mathrm{C})}$. The observed ratio is in the range $[0.095, 0.101]$. Using the central value, $N_C \\approx \\frac{0.098}{0.0110} \\approx 8.9$. This suggests the molecule most likely contains $9$ carbon atoms.

This discrepancy is far too large for High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry, which typically has errors in the range of a few parts per million (ppm), corresponding to less than $0.001$ Da for a molecule of this mass.\n    Based on the disagreements with both the M+1 isotope ratio and the exact mass, the composition $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is rejected.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$**\n    This composition contains $c=9$ carbon atoms, $h=8$ hydrogen atoms, and $o=3$ oxygen atoms.\n    - **Elemental Analysis:** This composition contains no nitrogen, which is consistent with the CHN analysis.\n    - **Isotope Ratio ($M+1$):** The predicted $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ ratio is $N_C \\times A(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) = 9 \\times 0.0110 = 0.099$.

The provided $I_{M+2}/I_{M}$ ratio of $0.004 \\pm 0.001$ shows a discrepancy with the theoretical value of approximately $0.011$ for this formula. However, given the overwhelming and conclusive agreement from three independent and highly reliable pieces of data (CHN analysis, exact mass, and M+1 ratio), this minor discrepancy in the M+2 data point does not invalidate the conclusion.\n\nBased on the comprehensive evaluation, the elemental composition $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ is the only one consistent with the provided data.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) for this composition.

Substituting these values into the formula:\n$$DBE = 9 - \\frac{8}{2} + \\frac{0}{2} + 1$$\n$$DBE = 9 - 4 + 0 + 1$$\n$$DBE = 6$$\nA DBE of $6$ is chemically reasonable.

Then, by reconciling the computed DBE with the spectroscopic indicators of common functional groups mentioned above, infer the minimal set of rings and multiple bonds consistent with those functional groups.\n\nReport only the Double Bond Equivalent as a single integer with no units for your final answer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the general expression for the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) starting from fundamental principles, and then the calculation of the DBE for the given molecular formula $\\mathrm{C_{13}H_{12}Cl_{2}N_{2}O}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the DBE. The Double Bond Equivalent, or degree of unsaturation, quantifies the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It is defined as the number of pairs of hydrogen atoms that would need to be added to the molecule to make it saturated and acyclic.\n\nThe reference for saturation is a non-cyclic, unbranched alkane with $C$ carbon atoms, which has the general formula $\\mathrm{C_{C}H_{2C+2}}$. The number of hydrogen atoms in this reference saturated structure is $H_{ref} = 2C+2$. We will systematically consider how other elements affect this reference count.\n\n1.  **Halogens (X)**: A halogen atom (e.g., $\\mathrm{F}$, $\\mathrm{Cl}$, $\\mathrm{Br}$, $\\mathrm{I}$) is monovalent and forms one single bond, just like a hydrogen atom. Therefore, when calculating the degree of unsaturation, each halogen atom can be treated as equivalent to a hydrogen atom. For a molecule with formula $\\mathrm{C_{C}H_{H}X_{X}}$, the total count of monovalent atoms is effectively $H+X$.\n\n2.  **Oxygen (O)**: An oxygen atom is divalent. It can be incorporated into a saturated acyclic structure without affecting the hydrogen count. For example, it can be inserted into a C-C bond to form an ether (R-O-R') or into a C-H bond to form an alcohol (R-O-H). In either case, the number of hydrogen atoms in the corresponding saturated compound, $\\mathrm{C_{C}H_{2C+2}}$, remains unchanged. Thus, oxygen atoms are ignored in the DBE calculation.\n\n3.  **Nitrogen (N)**: A nitrogen atom is trivalent. When a nitrogen atom is incorporated into a saturated acyclic structure, it requires an additional hydrogen atom to maintain saturation compared to a hydrocarbon. For instance, inserting an $\\mathrm{NH}$ group into a C-C bond increases the atom count by one $\\mathrm{N}$ and one $\\mathrm{H}$. Alternatively, replacing a $\\mathrm{CH}$ group with a nitrogen atom (requiring it to bond to three other atoms) means the carbon backbone now has one more bonding site, which will be occupied by a hydrogen in the saturated analogue. Therefore, for each nitrogen atom in the formula, we must add one hydrogen to the reference count for a saturated molecule. For a molecule containing $C$ carbons and $N$ nitrogens, the number of hydrogens in its saturated acyclic form is $H_{max\\_H} = 2C+2+N$.\n\nCombining these rules, for a molecule with the general formula $\\mathrm{C_{C}H_{H}X_{X}N_{N}O_{O}}$, the maximum number of monovalent atoms (hydrogens and halogens) that the carbon-nitrogen skeleton can support if it were saturated and acyclic is $H_{max} = 2C+2+N$. The actual number of monovalent atoms present in the molecule is $H_{actual} = H+X$.\n\nThe deficiency in monovalent atoms is the difference between the maximum possible and the actual count:\n$$H_{deficiency} = H_{max} - H_{actual} = (2C+2+N) - (H+X)$$\nSince each degree of unsaturation (one double bond or one ring) corresponds to a loss of two hydrogen atoms, the DBE is half of this deficiency:\n$$DBE = \\frac{H_{deficiency}}{2} = \\frac{(2C+2+N) - (H+X)}{2}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into a more commonly used form:\n$$DBE = C - \\frac{H}{2} - \\frac{X}{2} + \\frac{N}{2} + 1$$\nThis is the general expression for the Double Bond Equivalent.\n\nNext, we compute the DBE for the given molecular formula, $\\mathrm{C_{13}H_{12}Cl_{2}N_{2}O}$.\nThe atom counts are:\n-   Number of carbon atoms, $C = 13$.\n-   Number of hydrogen atoms, $H = 12$.\n-   Number of halogen (chlorine) atoms, $X = 2$.\n-   Number of nitrogen atoms, $N = 2$.\n-   Number of oxygen atoms, $O = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived DBE formula:\n$$DBE = 13 - \\frac{12}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{2}{2} + 1$$\n$$DBE = 13 - 6 - 1 + 1 + 1$$\n$$DBE = 7 - 1 + 1 + 1$$\n$$DBE = 8$$\nThe Double Bond Equivalent for the compound is $8$.\n\nThe problem also asks to reconcile this value with the spectroscopic data. The data indicate:\n-   A para-disubstituted benzene ring: This structure consists of one ring and three double bonds, accounting for $4$ DBEs ($1+3=4$).\n-   A conjugated carbonyl group ($\\mathrm{C=O}$): This is one double bond, accounting for $1$ DBE. The IR absorption at $1665\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is typical for a carbonyl group conjugated with an aromatic ring or another double bond, which is consistent.\n-   A nitrile group ($\\mathrm{C \\equiv N}$): This is one triple bond, which is equivalent to two double bonds, accounting for $2$ DBEs. The IR absorption at $2225\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is characteristic of a nitrile.\nThe sum of DBEs from these specified functional groups is $4 + 1 + 2 = 7$.\nThe calculated total DBE from the molecular formula is $8$. The difference of $8 - 7 = 1$ signifies an additional degree of unsaturation in the molecule, which could be another ring or another double bond not explicitly identified by the simplified interpretation of the provided spectroscopic highlights.

The solvents have the following approximate properties on the Kamlet–Taft scale: $S_1$ is nonpolar and non-hydrogen-bonding with dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_r\\approx 2$ and hydrogen-bond donor ability $\\alpha\\approx 0$ and acceptor ability $\\beta\\approx 0$; $S_2$ is polar protic with $\\varepsilon_r\\approx 33$, $\\alpha\\approx 0.93$, $\\beta\\approx 0.62$; $S_3$ is polar aprotic with $\\varepsilon_r\\approx 47$, $\\alpha\\approx 0$, $\\beta\\approx 0.76$.

Hydrogen bonding that weakens a bond lowers $k$, which, through the square-root dependence above, lowers $\\tilde{\\nu}$ (a red-shift). Band broadening can arise from a distribution of local environments (inhomogeneous broadening) and dynamic exchange among hydrogen-bonded states.\n\nFor $^1$H NMR, the resonance condition is $\\omega = \\gamma B_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, where $B_{\\mathrm{eff}}=B_0(1-\\sigma)$ depends on the applied field $B_0$ and the electronic shielding $\\sigma$.

In $S_3$ (high $\\beta$, $\\alpha=0$), the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch shows only a small shift, whereas the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts but broadens less than in $S_2$.

The key functional groups to consider are the carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C{=}O}$) and the phenolic hydroxyl ($\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$).\n\n**Reference State: Solvent $S_1$ ($n$-hexane)**\nIn $n$-hexane ($\\varepsilon_r \\approx 2$, $\\alpha \\approx 0$, $\\beta \\approx 0$), solvent-solute interactions are minimal, limited to weak, non-specific van der Waals forces. The IR and NMR spectra in this solvent serve as a baseline representing the \"free\" or nearly-free solute molecule, though some degree of intermolecular self-association between solute molecules (e.g., $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}\\cdots\\mathrm{O{=}C}$) might occur depending on concentration.\n\n**Analysis of Solvent Effects on IR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe fundamental vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is given by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$. A key principle is that hydrogen bonding to a group weakens its covalent bonds, which decreases the force constant $k$ and thus decreases $\\tilde{\\nu}$ (a red-shift).\n\n1.  **Carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C{=}O}$) Stretch:**\n    *   The carbonyl oxygen is a hydrogen-bond acceptor.\n    *   **In $S_2$ (methanol):** Methanol is a strong hydrogen-bond donor ($\\alpha \\approx 0.93$). It will form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen: $\\mathrm{C{=}O}\\cdots\\mathrm{H-O(CH_3)}$. This interaction draws electron density away from the carbonyl carbon and onto the oxygen, increasing the contribution of the single-bonded resonance structure $\\mathrm{C^{+}-O^{-}}$. This weakens the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ double bond, decreases the force constant $k$, and results in a significant **red-shift** (lower $\\tilde{\\nu}$) of the stretching frequency relative to $S_1$. The formation of this H-bond also increases the change in dipole moment during the vibration, which typically leads to an **increase in the intensity** of the absorption band.\n    *   **In $S_3$ (DMSO):** DMSO is not a hydrogen-bond donor ($\\alpha \\approx 0$). Therefore, it cannot form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen. The primary effect is the high polarity of the solvent ($\\varepsilon_r \\approx 47$), which can stabilize the charge-separated resonance form $\\mathrm{C^{+}-O^{-}}$ through dipole-dipole interactions. This effect also weakens the bond and causes a red-shift, but the magnitude of this general polarity effect is much smaller than that of a specific hydrogen bond. Thus, we expect a **small red-shift** relative to $S_1$, and a much smaller shift than in $S_2$.\n\n2.  **Phenolic Hydroxyl ($\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$) Stretch:**\n    *   The phenolic proton is a hydrogen-bond donor.\n    *   **In $S_2$ (methanol):** Methanol is a moderate hydrogen-bond acceptor ($\\beta \\approx 0.62$). The phenolic proton will donate a hydrogen bond to a methanol oxygen: $\\mathrm{Ar-O-H}\\cdots\\mathrm{O(H)CH_3}$. This interaction weakens the covalent $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ bond, lowers $k$, and causes a significant **red-shift**. Furthermore, in a protic solvent like methanol, the solute is part of a dynamic, three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network. The solute molecule rapidly exchanges between different hydrogen-bonded states. This distribution of local environments (inhomogeneous broadening) and rapid dynamic exchange leads to a **very broad** absorption band.\n    *   **In $S_3$ (DMSO):** DMSO is a very strong hydrogen-bond acceptor ($\\beta \\approx 0.76$). It will form a strong hydrogen bond with the phenolic proton: $\\mathrm{Ar-O-H}\\cdots\\mathrm{O{=}S(CH_3)_2}$. This strong interaction significantly weakens the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ bond, leading to a large **red-shift**, often even larger than in methanol. However, the nature of the broadening is different. DMSO is aprotic, so there is no extended network of exchangeable solvent protons. The solute primarily exists in a single, well-defined H-bonded state with the solvent. This more uniform environment results in an absorption band that is still broad compared to the \"free\" $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ in $S_1$, but is characteristically **much sharper than in protic solvents** like $S_2$.\n\n**Analysis of Solvent Effects on $^1$H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe chemical shift $\\delta$ is determined by the local electronic shielding $\\sigma$. Hydrogen bonding pulls electron density away from the bonded proton, reducing its shielding (deshielding), which results in a **downfield shift** (larger $\\delta$ value). The line shape is affected by the rate of chemical exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$).\n\n1.  **Labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ Proton:**\n    *   **In $S_2$ (methanol):** The hydrogen bonding to the methanol solvent deshields the phenolic proton, causing a **downfield shift** relative to $S_1$. Crucially, the phenolic proton is chemically exchangeable with the hydroxyl protons of the methanol solvent. In a protic solvent, this exchange is very fast. When the exchange rate is on the order of the NMR frequency difference between the exchanging sites, it leads to significant **line broadening**.\n    *   **In $S_3$ (DMSO):** The strong hydrogen bond to the DMSO oxygen causes significant deshielding and a large **downfield shift**. Since DMSO is aprotic, the phenolic proton does not exchange with the solvent. Exchange can still occur with other solute molecules or trace amounts of water, but the overall exchange rate ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) is much slower than in the protic network of $S_2$. This slower exchange results in a **sharper signal** for the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton compared to its appearance in methanol. Therefore, the broadening is more pronounced in $S_2$ than in $S_3$.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**\n*   **In $S_2$ (methanol) vs. $S_1$:**\n    *   IR $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$: Significant red-shift, increased intensity.\n    *   IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$: Significant red-shift, marked broadening.\n    *   NMR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$: Downfield shift, significant broadening due to fast exchange.\n*   **In $S_3$ (DMSO) vs. $S_1$:**\n    *   IR $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$: Small red-shift.\n    *   IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$: Large red-shift, moderate broadening (less than in $S_2$).\n    *   NMR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$: Large downfield shift, less broadened signal than in $S_2$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. In $S_2$ (high $\\alpha$), the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch red-shifts and gains intensity; the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts and markedly broadens. In $S_3$ (high $\\beta$, $\\alpha=0$), the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch shows only a small shift, whereas the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts but broadens less than in $S_2$. In $^1$H NMR, the labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton shifts downfield in both $S_2$ and $S_3$, with more pronounced line broadening in $S_2$ due to faster exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) within a protic hydrogen-bond network.**\n    *   This option aligns perfectly with our detailed analysis. The description of IR shifts and broadening for both $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ and $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ groups in both solvents is correct. The description of NMR shifts and relative line broadening is also correct.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. In $S_2$, the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch blue-shifts because the high dielectric constant increases $k$; the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts and narrows because hydrogen bonding makes the bond more harmonic. In $^1$H NMR, the labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton shifts upfield in $S_2$ because hydrogen bonding increases shielding.**\n    *   The claim of a blue-shift for the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch is incorrect; H-bonding causes a red-shift. The claim that the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ band narrows is incorrect; it broadens significantly in protic solvents. The claim of an upfield NMR shift is incorrect; H-bonding deshields, causing a downfield shift.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Increasing $\\varepsilon_r$ from $S_1$ to $S_2$ and $S_3$ universally blue-shifts both $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ and $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ IR bands; hydrogen bonding has negligible impact on IR positions compared to dielectric effects. In $^1$H NMR, labile proton chemical shifts are invariant across these solvents.**\n    *   The prediction of universal blue-shifts is incorrect. The assertion that H-bonding effects are negligible compared to dielectric effects is fundamentally wrong. The claim of invariant labile proton shifts is also incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. In $S_2$, the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch red-shifts but the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch blue-shifts because protic solvents donate hydrogen bonds that stiffen $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$. In $S_3$, the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton in $^1$H NMR is upfield relative to $S_1$ because aprotic solvents have higher $\\varepsilon_r$ but do not deshield labile protons; line shapes are broader in $S_3$ than $S_2$ due to slower exchange.**\n    *   The claim that the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch blue-shifts is incorrect; it red-shifts because H-bonding weakens the bond. The claim of an upfield NMR shift in $S_3$ is incorrect; the strong H-bond to DMSO causes a large downfield shift. The claim that the line shape is broader in $S_3$ than in $S_2$ is generally incorrect; the protic network in $S_2$ typically causes more pronounced broadening.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A provides a scientifically sound and complete description of the phenomena.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3722078"}]}
