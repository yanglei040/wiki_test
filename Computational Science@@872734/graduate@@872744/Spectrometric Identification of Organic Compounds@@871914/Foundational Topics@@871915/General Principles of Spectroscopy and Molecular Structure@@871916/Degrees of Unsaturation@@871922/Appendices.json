The analysis must be based exclusively on the facts provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we formalize the concept of the IHD. The problem states that the IHD quantifies the number of rings and multiple bonds by comparing the hydrogen count of a given molecule to that of a reference saturated acyclic hydrocarbon. A saturated acyclic hydrocarbon is one that contains the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms for a given number of carbon atoms, which implies it has no rings or multiple bonds.\n\nThe provided facts are:\n1. Carbon is tetravalent (forms $4$ bonds) and hydrogen is monovalent (forms $1$ bond).\n2. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with $n$ carbon atoms is $C_n H_{2n+2}$.\n3. The formation of a ring or a multiple bond results in a decrease in the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nLet's analyze the consequence of forming a ring or a multiple bond. To form a ring from an acyclic hydrocarbon chain, a new carbon-carbon bond must be made between two non-adjacent carbon atoms. To maintain the tetravalency of carbon, each of these two carbons must lose one hydrogen atom. This results in a net loss of $2$ hydrogen atoms. For instance, converting hexane ($C_6 H_{14}$) to cyclohexane ($C_6 H_{12}$) involves the loss of $2$ hydrogens.\n\nSimilarly, to form a double bond between two adjacent carbon atoms (i.e., introducing one $\\pi$ bond), two hydrogen atoms (one from each carbon) must be removed. To form a triple bond (introducing two $\\pi$ bonds), four hydrogen atoms must be removed. In every case, each \"element of unsaturation\"—defined as either one ring or one $\\pi$ bond—corresponds to a deficiency of $2$ hydrogen atoms relative to the saturated acyclic structure.\n\nLet $H_{ref}$ be the number of hydrogen atoms in the reference saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with $n$ carbon atoms. From the provided formula, $H_{ref} = 2n+2$.\nLet $H_{actual}$ be the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule under investigation, with the formula $C_n H_{actual}$.\nThe total hydrogen deficiency is the difference $H_{ref} - H_{actual}$.\nSince each degree of unsaturation accounts for a loss of $2$ hydrogen atoms, the IHD is half of this total deficiency.\n$$IHD = \\frac{H_{ref} - H_{actual}}{2} = \\frac{(2n+2) - H_{actual}}{2}$$\n\nNow, we apply this derived formula to the given molecular formula, $C_{10}H_{16}$.\nFor this molecule, the number of carbon atoms is $n=10$, and the number of hydrogen atoms is $H_{actual} = 16$.\nThe corresponding reference saturated acyclic hydrocarbon would have the formula $C_{10}H_{2(10)+2}$, which is $C_{10}H_{22}$.\nTherefore, $H_{ref} = 22$.\n\nThe IHD for $C_{10}H_{16}$ is:\n$$IHD = \\frac{22 - 16}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$$\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the molecule is $3$.\n\nThe problem asks to formalize the constraint on the total number of rings and $\\pi$ bonds. Let $r$ be the number of rings in the molecule, and let $\\pi$ be the total number of $\\pi$ bonds. As established, each ring and each $\\pi$ bond contributes one unit to the IHD. Therefore, the sum of the number of rings and the number of $\\pi$ bonds must equal the total IHD.\nThis gives the constraint equation:\n$$r + \\pi = IHD$$\nFor the specific case of $C_{10}H_{16}$, the equation is:\n$$r + \\pi = 3$$\n\nThe problem requires listing all distinct nonnegative integer pairs $(r, \\pi)$ that satisfy this equation. Since $r$ represents the number of rings and $\\pi$ represents the number of $\\pi$ bonds, both must be non-negative integers ($r \\ge 0, \\pi \\ge 0$). We can enumerate the solutions by systematically assigning values to $r$:\n- If $r=0$, then $\\pi=3$. The pair is $(0, 3)$. This corresponds to a molecule with no rings and three $\\pi$ bonds (e.g., an acyclic triene, or a molecule with one triple bond and one double bond).\n- If $r=1$, then $\\pi=2$. The pair is $(1, 2)$. This corresponds to a molecule with one ring and two $\\pi$ bonds (e.g., a cyclic diene like limonene, or a cycloalkyne).\n- If $r=2$, then $\\pi=1$. The pair is $(2, 1)$. This corresponds to a molecule with two rings and one $\\pi$ bond (e.g., a bicyclic alkene like pinene).\n- If $r=3$, then $\\pi=0$. The pair is $(3, 0)$. This corresponds to a molecule with three rings and no $\\pi$ bonds (e.g., a tricyclic alkane like adamantane).\nIf $r$ were greater than $3$, $\\pi$ would have to be negative, which is physically impossible. Thus, we have found all possible solutions.\nThe set of all valid, distinct, nonnegative integer pairs $(r, \\pi)$ is $\\{(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0)\\}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the total number of these distinct pairs. By counting the enumerated pairs, we find there are $4$ such pairs.\nThis corresponds to the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $r + \\pi = 3$, which can be found using the stars and bars method. For an equation of the form $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_k = n$, the number of non-negative integer solutions is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$. Here, $n=3$ and $k=2$, so the number of solutions is $\\binom{3+2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{4}{1} = 4$.\n\nThe total number of distinct nonnegative integer pairs $(r, \\pi)$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3698479"}, {"introduction": "Moving from simple hydrocarbons to molecules containing heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen adds a layer of complexity and chemical richness.

It is a standard, non-trivial exercise in applying the concept of IHD. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the computation of the IHD, and second, the reconciliation of the IHD with potential structural elements.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**\n\nThe IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, quantifies the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule relative to its corresponding saturated, acyclic counterpart. For a molecular formula given by $\\mathrm{C_c H_h N_n O_o X_x}$, where $c$, $h$, $n$, $o$, and $x$ are the numbers of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and halogen atoms, respectively, the IHD is calculated using the following established formula:\n\n$$ \\text{IHD} = c - \\frac{h}{2} - \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + 1 $$\n\nIn this formula, tetravalent atoms like carbon contribute to the hydrogen count of the saturated reference, monovalent atoms like hydrogen and halogens are counted directly, trivalent atoms like nitrogen increase the hydrogen capacity of the reference structure (and thus increase the IHD), and divalent atoms like oxygen have no effect on the calculation as they can be inserted into a saturated backbone without changing the hydrogen count.\n\nFor the given molecular formula, $\\mathrm{C_4H_5N_3O_2}$, the parameters are:\n-   $c = 4$\n-   $h = 5$\n-   $n = 3$\n-   $o = 2$\n-   $x = 0$\n\nSubstituting these values into the IHD formula:\n\n$$ \\text{IHD} = 4 - \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + 1 $$\n\nCombining the fractional terms:\n\n$$ \\text{IHD} = 4 + \\frac{3 - 5}{2} + 1 = 4 + \\frac{-2}{2} + 1 $$\n\n$$ \\text{IHD} = 4 - 1 + 1 $$\n\n$$ \\text{IHD} = 4 $$\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency for the compound $\\mathrm{C_4H_5N_3O_2}$ is $4$.\n\n**Part 2: Reconciliation of the IHD with Plausible Structural Features**\n\nAn IHD of $4$ signifies that the molecule possesses a combination of rings and $\\pi$ bonds totaling four. Specifically, $\\text{IHD} = (\\text{number of rings}) + (\\text{number of double bonds}) + 2 \\times (\\text{number of triple bonds}) = 4$. The problem states that IR spectroscopy suggests the presence of either a nitro group or azo functionality. We will analyze how the IHD of $4$ can be allocated in these scenarios.\n\n**Scenario A: Presence of a Nitro Group ($\\mathrm{-NO_2}$)**\n\nA nitro group is commonly depicted with one double bond and is formally described by the resonance structures $\\mathrm{-N^+(=\\text{O})\\text{O}^-} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{-N^+(\\text{O}^-)-\\text{O}}$. The presence of the $\\mathrm{N=O}$ double bond means that a single nitro group contributes $1$ unit to the IHD.\n\n-   Total IHD: $4$\n-   IHD from one $\\mathrm{-NO_2}$ group: $1$\n-   Remaining IHD: $4 - 1 = 3$\n\nThis remaining IHD of $3$ must be accounted for by the rest of the molecule, which has the elemental composition $\\mathrm{C_4H_5N_2}$. An IHD of $3$ in a $\\mathrm{C_4H_5N_2}$ fragment can be realized through various combinations of rings and multiple bonds. For instance:\n-   One ring and two double bonds (e.g., a substituted pyrazole or imidazole ring). The parent pyrazole ring, $\\mathrm{C_3H_4N_2}$, has an IHD of $3$. A derivative such as a cyanopyrrole could also fit.\n-   One triple bond and one double bond (e.g., a structure containing $\\mathrm{C \\equiv N}$ and $\\mathrm{C=C}$ bonds).\n-   Three double bonds and no rings (an acyclic structure).\n\nThus, the calculated IHD of $4$ is consistent with a structure containing one nitro group and an additional three degrees of unsaturation within its carbon-nitrogen framework.\n\n**Scenario B: Presence of \"Azo Functionality\"**\n\nThe term \"azo functionality\" in a molecule with three nitrogen atoms, $\\mathrm{N_3}$, is ambiguous. We consider two chemically plausible interpretations for a neutral $\\mathrm{N_3}$ moiety.\n\n1.  **Azide Group ($\\mathrm{-N_3}$):** The azide group is a common $\\mathrm{N_3}$ functional group. Its structure is best described as a resonance hybrid, with a major contributor being $\\mathrm{-N=N^+=N^-}$. This structure contains two consecutive double bonds. Therefore, an azide group contributes $2$ units to the IHD.\n\n    -   Total IHD: $4$\n    -   IHD from one $\\mathrm{-N_3}$ group: $2$\n    -   Remaining IHD: $4 - 2 = 2$\n\n    The remaining fragment would have the formula $\\mathrm{C_4H_5O_2}$ and must contain an IHD of $2$. This can be achieved by, for example:\n    -   Two double bonds (e.g., one $\\mathrm{C=C}$ and one $\\mathrm{C=O}$ from a carboxylic acid or ketone).\n    -   One triple bond (e.g., a $\\mathrm{C \\equiv C}$ bond).\n    -   One ring and one double bond (e.g., a substituted cyclopropene carboxylic acid).\n\n2.  **Triazene Group ($\\mathrm{-N=N-N<}$):** This functionality contains one $\\mathrm{N=N}$ double bond and would contribute $1$ unit to the IHD. If the group exists as, for example, a $\\mathrm{-N=N-NH-}$ fragment, it consumes $\\mathrm{N_3H}$.\n\n    -   Total IHD: $4$\n    -   IHD from one $\\mathrm{-N=N-}$ bond: $1$\n    -   Remaining IHD: $4 - 1 = 3$\n\n    The remaining fragment, $\\mathrm{C_4H_4O_2}$, would need to account for an IHD of $3$. This is characteristic of highly unsaturated or aromatic systems, such as a substituted furan or a chain with multiple bonds.\n\nIn all cases, the calculated IHD of $4$ can be logically and consistently allocated among the functional groups suggested by the problem statement and the remaining molecular framework in accordance with the fundamental principles of chemical bonding and structure. The high IHD value is also consistent with the qualitative NMR data suggesting a \"limited hydrogen density.\"", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "3698411"}, {"introduction": "The standard IHD formula is a powerful heuristic, but its predictive power rests on the assumption of typical valences for common elements.

That heuristic breaks down when atoms exhibit nonstandard valences (e.g., divalent carbenes), are electron-deficient (e.g., boron), or are hypervalent (e.g., phosphorus above a trivalent state).

The species and their properties are correctly described according to established principles of chemistry. The problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the distinction between two methods for calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD): a simplified heuristic and a general valence-based approach.\n\n1.  **Simplified Heuristic**: This method is based on a formula derived for neutral organic molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and halogens, assuming a standard set of valences: tetravalent carbon ($v_C=4$), trivalent nitrogen ($v_N=3$), divalent oxygen ($v_O=2$), and monovalent hydrogen and halogens ($v_H=v_X=1$). The standard formula is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{IHD}_{\\text{heuristic}} = c + 1 - \\frac{h}{2} - \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} $$\n    where $c, h, x, n$ are the number of carbon, hydrogen, halogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Oxygen atoms are ignored. This formula breaks down when atoms not included in the formula are present (e.g., Boron B, Phosphorus P) or when atoms exhibit non-standard valences (e.g., a divalent carbon in a carbene). For atoms not covered by the heuristic, a common but not always reliable extension is to substitute them with an element from the same group that is covered (e.g., treat P as N).\n\n2.  **General Valence-Based Approach**: This is the fundamental definition of IHD. The IHD represents the number of pairs of hydrogen atoms that would need to be removed from a corresponding saturated acyclic reference molecule to form the target molecule. Structurally, it is the sum of the number of rings and $\\pi$-bonds in the molecule. A general formula can be derived based on the valence ($v_i$) of each atom ($i$) in the molecule:\n    $$ \\mathrm{IHD}_{\\text{general}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} n_i (v_i - 2) $$\n    where $n_i$ is the number of atoms of type $i$. This formula is universally applicable, provided the correct valences for the atoms in the specific molecule are used. For a saturated acyclic molecule, $\\mathrm{IHD}=0$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each statement by applying both methods.\n\n**A. For $\\ce{:CCl2}$, the simplified heuristic predicts $\\mathrm{IHD}=1$, but the general valence-based approach gives $\\mathrm{IHD}=0$; the discrepancy arises because the carbene carbon has nonstandard valence $2$ rather than $4$.**\n\n*   **Simplified Heuristic**: The molecule is $\\ce{CCl2}$, so the formula is $\\text{C}_1\\text{Cl}_2$. We have $c=1$, $h=0$, $x=2$, $n=0$.

Halogens are monovalent ($v_{Cl} = 1$). A dichlorocarbene molecule has a central carbon atom single-bonded to two chlorine atoms, with a lone pair on the carbon. There are no rings and no $\\pi$-bonds. Therefore, by its definition, the IHD is $0$.\n    Using the general formula with $n_C=1, v_C=2$ and $n_{Cl}=2, v_{Cl}=1$:\n    $$ \\mathrm{IHD}_{\\text{general}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} [n_C(v_C-2) + n_{Cl}(v_{Cl}-2)] = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} [1(2-2) + 2(1-2)] = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} [0 + 2(-1)] = 1 - 1 = 0 $$\n*   **Analysis**: The heuristic predicts $\\mathrm{IHD}=1$, while the general approach gives $\\mathrm{IHD}=0$.
