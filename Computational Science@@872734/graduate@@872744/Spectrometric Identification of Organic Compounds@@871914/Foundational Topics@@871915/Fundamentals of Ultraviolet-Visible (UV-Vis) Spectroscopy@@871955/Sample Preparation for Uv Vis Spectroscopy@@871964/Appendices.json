First, the Beer-Lambert law is used to determine the required final concentration ($C_{\\text{final}}$) of the dye in the standard to achieve a target absorbance ($A$). Second, the dilution equation ($C_1V_1 = C_2V_2$) is used to calculate the volume of the stock solution ($V_{\\text{stock}}$) needed to prepare the final volume ($V_{\\text{final}}$) of the standard at that concentration.\n\nThe Beer-Lambert law is given by:\n$$A = \\epsilon l C$$\nwhere $A$ is the absorbance (dimensionless), $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity in $\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $l$ is the path length of the cuvette in $\\mathrm{cm}$, and $C$ is the molar concentration of the absorbing species in $\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFrom this law, we can solve for the required final concentration, $C_{\\text{final}}$, for each standard:\n$$C_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$$\n\nThe dilution process is governed by the conservation of the amount of solute (moles).

The premise that a phenolate anion absorbs more strongly at a higher wavelength (bathochromic shift) than its corresponding neutral phenol is a well-established phenomenon. The given $pK_{a}$ of $10.0$ is a typical value for a phenol. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and constraints provided for a unique solution.
