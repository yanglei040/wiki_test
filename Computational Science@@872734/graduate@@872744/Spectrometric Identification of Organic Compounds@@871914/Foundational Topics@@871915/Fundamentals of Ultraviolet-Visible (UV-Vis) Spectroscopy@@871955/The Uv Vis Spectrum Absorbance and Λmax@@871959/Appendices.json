The conditions for the calculation are explicitly stated, ensuring a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, with no identifiable flaws. It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe core principle governing the relationship between absorbance, concentration, and path length in a homogeneous, non-scattering medium is the Beer-Lambert Law. This law represents the linear attenuation model mentioned in the problem. It is mathematically stated as:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\nwhere $A$ is the dimensionless absorbance, $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity (with units of $\\text{L mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$), $c$ is the molar concentration of the absorbing species (in $\\text{mol L}^{-1}$), and $l$ is the optical path length (in $\\text{cm}$).\n\nThe first part of the task is to determine the solute concentration, $c$, required to achieve a target absorbance. We can rearrange the Beer-Lambert Law to solve for $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$$\nThe problem provides the values for the quantities on the right side of the equation at the wavelength of maximum absorbance, $\\lambda_{\\max}$. Specifically, we are given $A = 0.800$, $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\max} = 2.50 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{L mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, and the nominal path length $l = 1.000\\,\\text{cm}$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$c = \\frac{0.800}{(2.50 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{L mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) \\times (1.000\\,\\text{cm})}$$\n$$c = \\frac{0.800}{2.50 \\times 10^{4}}\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$$\n$$c = 0.320 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1} = 3.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the concentration is:\n$$c = 3.200 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine the first-order fractional uncertainty in $c$, denoted as $\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|}$, that arises solely from the uncertainty in the path length, $\\delta l$. The problem states that $\\epsilon_{\\max}$ and $A$ are to be treated as exact quantities. Therefore, $c$ is a function of a single variable with uncertainty, $l$.\nThe relationship is $c(l) = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l} = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon} l^{-1}$.\n\nTo find the uncertainty $\\delta c$ resulting from the uncertainty $\\delta l$, we use the first-order approximation from differential calculus for error propagation:\n$$\\delta c \\approx \\left| \\frac{dc}{dl} \\right| \\delta l$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $c$ with respect to $l$:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dl} = \\frac{d}{dl}\\left(\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}\\right) = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon} \\frac{d}{dl}(l^{-1}) = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon}(-1 \\cdot l^{-2}) = -\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2}$$\nThe absolute value of the derivative is:\n$$\\left| \\frac{dc}{dl} \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2} \\right| = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2}$$\nThe fractional uncertainty in $c$ is defined as $\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|}$. Since $A$, $\\epsilon$, and $l$ are all positive quantities, $|c| = c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$. We can now write the expression for the fractional uncertainty:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|} \\approx \\frac{\\left| \\frac{dc}{dl} \\right| \\delta l}{|c|} = \\frac{\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2} \\delta l}{\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}}$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|} \\approx \\left(\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon l}{A}\\right) \\delta l = \\frac{\\delta l}{l}$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a quantity inversely proportional to a variable, their first-order fractional uncertainties are equal.\n\nWe are given the uncertainty in the path length, $\\delta l = 0.004\\,\\text{cm}$, and the nominal path length, $l = 1.000\\,\\text{cm}$. Substituting these values:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|} \\approx \\frac{0.004\\,\\text{cm}}{1.000\\,\\text{cm}} = 0.004$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The molecule comprises a carbonyl group conjugated to a carbon–carbon double bond with the following substitution pattern on the conjugated $\\mathrm{C=C}$ unit: the $\\alpha$-carbon (adjacent to the carbonyl) bears no alkyl or ring substituent beyond the carbonyl and the $\\beta$-carbon; the $\\beta$-carbon bears two alkyl substituents (two methyl groups).

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of UV-Visible spectroscopy and the well-established empirical rules (commonly known as Woodward-Fieser rules or modifications thereof) used for predicting absorption maxima in conjugated organic molecules. It provides a specific, real compound ($4$-methyl-$3$-penten-$2$-one, or mesityl oxide), its structural features, a measured value for $\\lambda_{\\max}$, and a clear objective. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for its solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe prediction of $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for conjugated systems via empirical rules is based on the photophysical principle that structural modifications to a core chromophore systematically alter the energy difference ($\\Delta E$) between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). For the $\\pi \\to \\pi^{*}$ transition in an $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone, the chromophore's $\\pi$ system gives rise to the relevant molecular orbitals.

The empirical rules quantify these shifts as additive increments to a base value for a parent chromophore.\n\nThe molecule in question is $4$-methyl-$3$-penten-$2$-one. Its structure is $\\mathrm{CH_3C(O)CH=C(CH_3)_2}$. This is an acyclic $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone.

The problem confirms there are no alkyl or ring substituents. The increment for $\\alpha$-substituents is therefore $0$.\n-   At the $\\beta$-position $(\\mathrm{C}^{\\beta})$: There are two methyl groups attached. The problem states this explicitly.

In the baseline region ($\\lambda \\ge 360$ nm), there is no electronic absorption, so $A_{\\text{total}}(\\lambda) = A_{\\text{scat}}(\\lambda)$. We linearize the scattering model by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(A_{\\text{scat}}) = \\ln(k) - \\alpha\\,\\ln(\\lambda) $$\nThis equation is of the form $y = c + mx$, with $y = \\ln(A_{\\text{scat}})$, $x = \\ln(\\lambda)$, intercept $c = \\ln(k)$, and slope $m = -\\alpha$.\nWe can determine $\\alpha$ from pairs of data points. For instance, using the data at $\\lambda_1 = 400$ nm and $\\lambda_2 = 420$ nm:\n$$ \\alpha = -\\frac{\\ln(A_2) - \\ln(A_1)}{\\ln(\\lambda_2) - \\ln(\\lambda_1)} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.01728) - \\ln(0.02000)}{\\ln(420) - \\ln(400)} = -\\frac{-4.05833 - (-3.91202)}{6.04025 - 5.99146} = \\frac{0.14631}{0.04879} \\approx 2.9988 $$\nThis value is exceptionally close to the integer $3$. We hypothesize that the data were generated using $\\alpha = 3$. Let's test this assumption. If $\\alpha=3$, we can calculate $k$ from each baseline data point:\n- At $\\lambda = 360$ nm: $k = A_{\\text{scat}} \\lambda^3 = 0.02746 \\times (360)^3 \\approx 1.281 \\times 10^6$\n- At $\\lambda = 400$ nm: $k = A_{\\text{scat}} \\lambda^3 = 0.02000 \\times (400)^3 = 1.280 \\times 10^6$\n- At $\\lambda = 420$ nm: $k = A_{\\text{scat}} \\lambda^3 = 0.01728 \\times (420)^3 \\approx 1.280 \\times 10^6$\nThe values for $k$ are highly consistent, especially for the two points at higher wavelengths. The slight deviation at $\\lambda = 360$ nm can be attributed to minor experimental error or rounding. The evidence strongly supports the model $A_{\\text{scat}}(\\lambda) = k\\,\\lambda^{-3}$.
