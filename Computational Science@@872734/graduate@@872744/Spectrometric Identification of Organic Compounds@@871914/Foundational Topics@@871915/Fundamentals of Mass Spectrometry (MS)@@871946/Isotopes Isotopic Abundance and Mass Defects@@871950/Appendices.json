The calculation will be based on the provided high-precision masses of the constituent monoisotopic atoms and the proton.\n\nFirst, we establish the method for calculating the mass of the ion. The mass of a neutral molecule, $\\mathrm{M}$, in mass spectrometry is conventionally calculated by summing the masses of its constituent neutral atoms using their most abundant isotopes (monoisotopic mass).\nThe molecular formula is specified as $\\mathrm{C}_{7}\\mathrm{H}_{7}\\mathrm{N}$. The monoisotopic mass of the neutral molecule, $m(\\mathrm{M})$, is therefore given by the sum of the atomic masses of its components:\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 7 \\cdot m({}^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 7 \\cdot m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\,\\text{atom}) + 1 \\cdot m({}^{14}\\mathrm{N}\\,\\text{atom})$$\n\nThe ion of interest is the protonated molecular ion, $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}$, which is formed by the addition of a proton, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, to the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$. The mass of this ion, $m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+})$, is the sum of the mass of the neutral molecule and the mass of a proton:\n$$m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}) = m(\\mathrm{M}) + m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m(\\mathrm{M})$, we obtain the full expression for the mass of the ion:\n$$m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}) = \\left( 7 \\cdot m({}^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 7 \\cdot m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\,\\text{atom}) + 1 \\cdot m({}^{14}\\mathrm{N}\\,\\text{atom}) \\right) + m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$$\n\nA crucial part of the problem is to explain why the mass of an electron, $m_e$, does not need to be explicitly subtracted in this calculation. This can be understood by carefully considering what the provided masses represent.\nThe given atomic masses, such as $m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\,\\text{atom})$ and $m({}^{14}\\mathrm{N}\\,\\text{atom})$, are the masses of the *neutral atoms*. A neutral atom's mass includes the mass of its nucleus and the total mass of its electrons, minus a small mass equivalent of the electron binding energy.\nLet $m_n(X)$ be the mass of the nucleus of an atom $X$, and $Z_X$ be its atomic number (number of electrons). Then, $m(\\text{atom } X) \\approx m_n(X) + Z_X \\cdot m_e$.\nWhen we calculate $m(\\mathrm{M})$ by summing the atomic masses, we are effectively summing the masses of all the nuclei and all the electrons in the neutral molecule:\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) \\approx \\sum_{\\text{atoms in M}} (m_n(\\text{atom}) + Z \\cdot m_e) = (\\text{total mass of nuclei in M}) + (\\text{total mass of electrons in M})$$\nFor $\\mathrm{C}_{7}\\mathrm{H}_{7}\\mathrm{N}$, the total number of electrons is $7 \\cdot 6 + 7 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 7 = 42 + 7 + 7 = 56$ electrons.\nThe ion $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}$ is formed by adding a proton, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ (a nucleus with no electrons), to the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$. The resulting ion thus has the same number of electrons ($56$) as the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe calculation $m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}) = m(\\mathrm{M}) + m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$ correctly reflects this. We start with the mass of the neutral molecule $m(\\mathrm{M})$, which already accounts for all $56$ electrons. We then add the mass of the incoming particle, which is a proton, $m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$. Since a proton has no electrons, no electron arithmetic is required. The charge of $+1$ on the ion arises because there is an excess of one proton in the nucleus relative to the total number of electrons.\n\nThe alternative calculation, often seen, is $m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}) = m(\\mathrm{M}) + m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\,\\text{atom}) - m_e$. This method is conceptually equivalent. The mass of a hydrogen atom is approximately the mass of a proton plus the mass of an electron, $m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\,\\text{atom}) \\approx m(\\mathrm{H}^{+}) + m_e$. The provided values confirm this: $m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\,\\text{atom}) - m(\\mathrm{H}^{+}) = 1.007825032\\,\\mathrm{u} - 1.007276\\,\\mathrm{u} = 0.000549032\\,\\mathrm{u}$, which is very close to the electron mass ($m_e \\approx 0.00054858\\,\\mathrm{u}$). The small difference is due to the binding energy of the electron in the hydrogen atom. Using $m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$ directly as specified is the more fundamental approach.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation using the given values:\n$m({}^{12}\\mathrm{C})=12.000000\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n$m({}^{1}\\mathrm{H}\\,\\text{atom})=1.007825032\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n$m({}^{14}\\mathrm{N}\\,\\text{atom})=14.003074005\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n$m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})=1.007276\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n\nFirst, calculate the monoisotopic mass of the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{C}_{7}\\mathrm{H}_{7}\\mathrm{N}$:\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 7 \\cdot (12.000000) + 7 \\cdot (1.007825032) + 1 \\cdot (14.003074005)$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 84.000000 + 7.054775224 + 14.003074005$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 105.057849229\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n\nNext, calculate the mass of the protonated ion, $m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+})$:\n$$m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}) = m(\\mathrm{M}) + m(\\mathrm{H}^{+})$$\n$$m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}) = 105.057849229\\,\\mathrm{u} + 1.007276\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n$$m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}) = 106.065125229\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, is the mass of the ion divided by its charge number, $z$. For $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}$, the charge is $+1e$, so $z=1$.\n$$m/z = \\frac{m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+})}{z} = \\frac{106.065125229\\,\\mathrm{u}}{1}$$\nThe unit Thomson (Th) is defined as $1\\,\\mathrm{Th} = 1\\,\\mathrm{u}/e$, which is the unit for $m/z$.\n$$m/z = 106.065125229\\,\\mathrm{Th}$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to seven significant figures. The calculated value is $106.065125229$. The first seven significant figures are $1, 0, 6, 0, 6, 5, 1$. The eighth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$m/z_{\\text{rounded}} = 106.0651\\,\\mathrm{Th}$$\nThe mass defect mentioned in the problem is implicitly accounted for in this calculation. The definition $m({}^{12}\\mathrm{C}) = 12\\,\\mathrm{u}$ exactly establishes the atomic mass unit. The masses of all other nuclides, like ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ and ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, deviate from their integer mass numbers due to nuclear binding energy. This deviation is the mass defect, and it is precisely what allows HRMS to distinguish between ions of the same nominal mass but different elemental compositions.

Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. $\\mathrm{C}_{3}\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\mathrm{Br}$:\n- Nitrogen rule: $\\mathrm{N} = 0$ (even). Odd nominal mass ($121$) in EI contradicts the nitrogen rule. Inconsistent.\n- Isotope envelope: A single bromine atom gives nearly equal $\\mathrm{M}$ and $\\mathrm{M}+2$ intensities because $^{79}\\mathrm{Br} \\approx 50.69\\%$ and $^{81}\\mathrm{Br} \\approx 49.31\\%$, so $I_{\\mathrm{M}+2}/I_{\\mathrm{M}} \\approx 97\\%$. The observed $\\approx 0.36\\%$ rules out bromine.\n- Exact mass (with $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$):\n  $$m(\\mathrm{C}_{3}\\mathrm{H}_{6}{}^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) = 3 \\times 12.000000000 + 6 \\times 1.00782503223 + 78.9183376,$$\n  $$= 36.000000000 + 6.04695019338 + 78.9183376 = 120.96528779338\\,\\mathrm{u}.$$\n  Difference from observed $121.08915\\,\\mathrm{u}$ is $\\approx 0.12386\\,\\mathrm{u}$; relative error $\\approx \\dfrac{0.12386}{120.96529}\\times 10^6 \\approx 1{,}024\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nSynthesis of evidence:\n- Only option A satisfies the EI nitrogen rule (odd mass requires odd $\\mathrm{N}$ count), reproduces the observed $\\mathrm{M}+1$ and $\\mathrm{M}+2$ intensities without halogen signatures, and matches the exact mass within $\\ll 2\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n\nTherefore, the formula consistent with the EI radical cation observation is $\\mathrm{C_8H_{11}N}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3709154"}]}
