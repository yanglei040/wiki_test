The problem uses $\\mathrm{M}$ to denote the nominal mass of the neutral molecule and $N$ for the nitrogen count, so we will equate $N=n$.\n\n**1. Relationship between the parity of the neutral nominal mass ($\\mathrm{M}$) and the hydrogen count ($h$).**\n\nThe nominal mass of a molecule is the sum of the nominal masses of its constituent atoms. The nominal mass of an element is the integer mass of its most abundant, stable isotope. The widely accepted nominal masses for the elements in question are:\n- Carbon ($^{12}\\mathrm{C}$): $12$\n- Hydrogen ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$): $1$\n- Nitrogen ($^{14}\\mathrm{N}$): $14$\n- Oxygen ($^{16}\\mathrmO$): $16$\n- Sulfur ($^{32}\\mathrmS$): $32$\n\nThe nominal mass of the neutral molecule, $\\mathrm{M}$, is given by the expression:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} = 12c + 1h + 14n + 16o + 32s $$\nTo find the relationship between the parities, we analyze this equation using modulo $2$ arithmetic.\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = (12c + 1h + 14n + 16o + 32s) \\bmod 2 $$\nWe evaluate the parity of each term. An even number is congruent to $0 \\pmod 2$, and an odd number is congruent to $1 \\pmod 2$.\n- $12c \\bmod 2 = 0$, since $12$ is even.\n- $1h \\bmod 2 = h \\bmod 2$, since $1$ is odd.\n- $14n \\bmod 2 = 0$, since $14$ is even.\n- $16o \\bmod 2 = 0$, since $16$ is even.\n- $32s \\bmod 2 = 0$, since $32$ is even.\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = (0 + h + 0 + 0 + 0) \\bmod 2 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = h \\bmod 2 $$\nThis relationship shows that the parity of the nominal mass of the neutral molecule is determined solely by the parity of its number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Relationship between the parity of the hydrogen count ($h$) and the nitrogen count ($n$).**\n\nThis relationship arises from the principle of valence conservation in stable, neutral, covalent molecules. The total number of valence \"slots\" across all atoms must be an even number, as each covalent bond satisfies two such slots. Therefore, the sum of the valences of all atoms in the molecule must be an even integer.\n\nThe standard valences for these elements in stable organic molecules like peptides are:\n- Carbon: $4$\n- Hydrogen: $1$\n- Nitrogen: $3$\n- Oxygen: $2$\n- Sulfur: $2$ (e.g., in cysteine or methionine)\n\nThe sum of valences, $\\sum V$, for the molecule $\\mathrm{C}_c \\mathrm{H}_h \\mathrm{N}_n \\mathrm{O}_o \\mathrm{S}_s$ is:\n$$ \\sum V = 4c + 1h + 3n + 2o + 2s $$\nAs established, this sum must be even:\n$$ \\left( \\sum V \\right) \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\n$$ (4c + 1h + 3n + 2o + 2s) \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\nAnalyzing each term modulo $2$:\n- $4c \\bmod 2 = 0$.\n- $1h \\bmod 2 = h \\bmod 2$.\n- $3n \\bmod 2 = n \\bmod 2$, since $3$ is odd.\n- $2o \\bmod 2 = 0$.\n- $2s \\bmod 2 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the valence sum equation gives:\n$$ (0 + h + n + 0 + 0) \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\n$$ (h + n) \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\nThis equation implies that the sum of the hydrogen count and the nitrogen count must be an even number. This can only be true if $h$ and $n$ have the same parity (both even or both odd). Therefore:\n$$ h \\bmod 2 = n \\bmod 2 $$\nThis establishes that the parity of the hydrogen count is identical to the parity of the nitrogen count.\n\n**3. Application to the observed ion and final calculation.**\n\nWe are given the nominal $m/z$ of the singly protonated ion $\\left[\\mathrmM+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+}$ is $1568$. Since the charge $z$ is $1$, a low-resolution instrument measures the nominal mass of the ion, $\\mathrm{M_{ion}}$, to be $1568$.\n$$ \\mathrm{M_{ion}} = 1568 $$\nThe parity of the ion's mass is:\n$$ \\mathrm{M_{ion}} \\bmod 2 = 1568 \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\nThe ion's mass is even.\n\nThe ion $\\left[\\mathrmM+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+}$ is formed by adding a proton ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) to the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$. In terms of mass, this corresponds to adding one hydrogen atom (nominal mass $1$) to the neutral molecule.\n$$ \\mathrm{M_{ion}} = \\mathrm{M} + 1 $$\nTaking this equation modulo $2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{M_{ion}} \\bmod 2 = (\\mathrm{M} + 1) \\bmod 2 $$\nWe can now substitute the known parity of the ion's mass:\n$$ 0 = (\\mathrm{M} + 1) \\bmod 2 $$\nThis equation is satisfied only if $\\mathrm{M}+1$ is an even number, which requires that $\\mathrm{M}$ must be an odd number. Thus, we find the parity of the neutral molecule's nominal mass:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = 1 $$\n\nNow we combine the relationships derived in the first two parts:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = h \\bmod 2 $$\n$$ h \\bmod 2 = n \\bmod 2 $$\nChaining these together, we get the relationship between the neutral mass parity and the nitrogen count parity:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = n \\bmod 2 $$\nAs per the problem's notation, $N=n$, so:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = N \\bmod 2 $$\nSince we found that $\\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = 1$, it directly follows that:\n$$ N \\bmod 2 = 1 $$\nThis means the number of nitrogen atoms in the peptide is odd.\n\nThe final answer is a two-entry row matrix giving the parity of the neutral nominal mass and the parity of the nitrogen count.\n- $\\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = 1$\n- $N \\bmod 2 = 1$\n\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3727480"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting mass spectra of large molecules presents unique challenges, particularly when the monoisotopic peak is not the most abundant one in the isotopic cluster.

The \"nitrogen rule,\" isotopic abundance distributions, and the behavior of high-mass molecules in ESI-HRMS are all standard topics in analytical chemistry. The phenomenon where the ($A+1$) isotopologue peak is more intense than the monoisotopic peak ($A$) is a well-known consequence of probability for molecules with a large number of carbon atoms. The provided mass-to-charge ratios and intensities are physically realistic for a peptide, a small protein, or another large biomolecule.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear scenario and asks for a specific conclusion based on given data and fundamental principles. The information provided is sufficient to identify the monoisotopic peak and apply the nitrogen rule correctly. The phrase \"singly charged molecular ion cluster\" under ESI conditions strongly implies the formation of an even-electron species such as $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$, which is the most common outcome for such analytes in positive-ion mode. This allows for a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and scientific language. It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, and speculative claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Derivation\nThe solution requires the correct application of two fundamental concepts: isotope distribution statistics and the nitrogen rule.\n\n**1. Isotope Distribution and Identification of the Monoisotopic Peak**\n\nThe monoisotopic peak, which we will denote as $M$, corresponds to the molecular ion composed exclusively of the most abundant isotopes of each element (e.g., $^{12}\\text{C}$, $^{1}\\text{H}$, $^{14}\\text{N}$, $^{16}\\text{O}$, $^{32}\\text{S}$). Subsequent peaks in the isotopic envelope, $M+1$, $M+2$, etc., arise from molecules containing one, two, etc., heavy isotopes (primarily $^{13}\\text{C}$).\n\nThe relative intensity of the $M+1$ peak to the $M$ peak is governed by the number of atoms that can contribute a heavy isotope. Primarily, it is a function of the number of carbon atoms, $n_C$, and the natural abundance of $^{13}\\text{C}$, $p \\approx 0.011$. The intensity ratio can be approximated using binomial statistics:\n$$ \\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)} \\approx \\frac{n_C \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)^{n_C-1}}{(1-p)^{n_C}} = \\frac{n_C \\cdot p}{1-p} $$\nThe problem states that the peak at $m/z\\,2002$ is more intense than the peak at $m/z\\,2001$, with a ratio of $I(2002)/I(2001) = 107/100 = 1.07$. This indicates that the peak at $m/z\\,2001$ is the monoisotopic peak ($M$) and the peak at $m/z\\,2002$ is the $M+1$ peak. This situation occurs when:\n$$ \\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)} > 1 \\implies \\frac{n_C \\cdot p}{1-p} > 1 $$\n$$ n_C > \\frac{1-p}{p} \\approx \\frac{1-0.011}{0.011} = \\frac{0.989}{0.011} \\approx 89.9 $$\nThus, for a molecule with approximately $90$ or more carbon atoms, the $M+1$ peak is expected to be the base peak of the isotopic envelope. A molecule with a mass of $\\sim 2000~\\text{Da}$ can easily contain this many carbons, so the data are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the monoisotopic peak, which represents the ion containing only the most abundant natural isotopes, is correctly identified at $m/z\\,2001$.\n\n**2. The Nitrogen Rule and Its Application**\n\nThe nitrogen rule states that for a neutral organic molecule containing only C, H, N, O, S, halogens, or P, its nominal monoisotopic mass will have a specific parity depending on the number of nitrogen atoms ($n_N$) it contains.\n- If $n_N$ is **even** (e.g., $0, 2, 4, ...$), the nominal monoisotopic mass of the neutral molecule is **even**.\n- If $n_N$ is **odd** (e.g., $1, 3, 5, ...$), the nominal monoisotopic mass of the neutral molecule is **odd**.\n\nCritically, the rule applies to the **neutral molecule's monoisotopic mass**. Our observed data are for an ion. ESI is a soft ionization technique that, for a molecule with basic sites (like N, O), will typically produce a protonated, even-electron ion $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$ in positive mode. The problem specifies a \"singly charged\" ion, consistent with this.\n\nThe observed monoisotopic peak is at $m/z = 2001$. Since the charge $z$ is $1$, the mass of the monoisotopic ion is $2001~\\text{Da}$. This mass corresponds to the neutral molecule $\\text{M}$ plus one proton, $\\text{H}^+$. For parity considerations, we use nominal (integer) masses.\n$$ \\text{Nominal Mass}([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+) = \\text{Nominal Mass}(\\text{M}) + \\text{Nominal Mass}(\\text{H}) $$\nThe nominal mass of the most abundant isotope of hydrogen ($^1\\text{H}$) is $1$. The nominal mass of the observed monoisotopic ion is $2001$.\n$$ 2001 = \\text{Nominal Mass}(\\text{M}) + 1 $$\nSolving for the nominal mass of the neutral molecule $\\text{M}$:\n$$ \\text{Nominal Mass}(\\text{M}) = 2001 - 1 = 2000 $$\nThe nominal monoisotopic mass of the neutral analyte is $2000$. This is an **even** number.\nAccording to the nitrogen rule, an even nominal mass implies that the molecule contains an **even number of nitrogen atoms**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because the base peak of the isotopic envelope is at $m/z\\,2002$, the nitrogen rule must be applied to $m/z\\,2002$, and the odd nominal mass at $2002$ indicates an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The nitrogen rule applies to the **monoisotopic mass**, not the mass of the most abundant isotopologue (the base peak). Applying the rule to the $M+1$ peak mass ($m/z$ $2002$) is incorrect. The fact that the $M+1$ peak is the base peak is a distraction that must be recognized and ignored when choosing the correct mass for the rule's application.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The monoisotopic peak for the singly charged even-electron ion $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$ is at $m/z\\,2001$, and the dominance of $m/z\\,2002$ is explained by the $^{13}\\text{C}$ binomial distribution at large carbon count. The nitrogen rule should be applied to the neutral monoisotopic mass, obtained by subtracting $1$ from $m/z\\,2001$ to give $2000$, which is even; therefore, the molecule contains an even number of nitrogen atoms.**\nThis statement correctly performs every step of the required analysis. It correctly identifies the monoisotopic peak at $m/z\\,2001$, provides the correct reason for the intensity pattern, correctly identifies the ion as $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$, correctly calculates the neutral monoisotopic mass ($2001 - 1 = 2000$), and correctly applies the nitrogen rule to conclude an even number of nitrogen atoms.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Because $M+1$ exceeds $M$, the nitrogen rule cannot be applied; the odd/even assessment is invalid when the monoisotopic peak is not the base peak.**\nThis is incorrect. The validity of the nitrogen rule is independent of the relative intensities within the isotopic envelope. The rule is based on the stoichiometry and mass properties of the molecule defined by the monoisotopic formula. The challenge lies in correctly identifying the monoisotopic peak, not in the rule's applicability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. One should use the isotopic centroid (approximately the intensity-weighted average near $m/z\\,2002$) in place of the monoisotopic mass to apply the nitrogen rule; since the centroid is near an odd nominal mass, the molecule has an odd number of nitrogen atoms.**\nThis is incorrect. The nitrogen rule is a discrete rule based on the integer nominal mass of a specific chemical entity (the monoisotopic molecule). The centroid mass is a non-integer, weighted average over multiple isotopologues and has no role in the application of the nitrogen rule. The premise of using an average mass for a parity rule is conceptually nonsensical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The observation that $M+1$ exceeds $M$ proves the presence of at least one nitrogen via $^{15}\\text{N}$, so the nitrogen rule should be applied directly to $m/z\\,2002$ to conclude an odd number of nitrogen atoms.**\nThis statement is incorrect on two counts. First, the high intensity of the $M+1$ peak is primarily due to the $^{13}\\text{C}$ contribution in a high-carbon-count molecule, not $^{15}\\text{N}$. The $^{13}\\text{C}$ abundance ($p \\approx 0.011$) is about three times that of $^{15}\\text{N}$ ($p \\approx 0.0037$), and its effect is magnified by the typically larger number of carbon atoms. Secondly, as with option A, it incorrectly applies the nitrogen rule to the $M+1$ peak instead of the monoisotopic peak.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3727481"}, {"introduction": "The predictive power of the nitrogen rule is powerful, but like most rules, it has important boundary conditions.

The usual nitrogen rule that maps odd nominal mass to odd $n_N$ applies to odd-electron ions; for even-electron ions the mapping reverses. Therefore, without knowing whether the observed ion is odd- or even-electron (and how it was formed), nominal mass parity alone cannot determine $n_N$ for nitroxide radicals.\n\nB.

Derivation of the Nitrogen Rule from First Principles**\n\nThe nitrogen rule relates the nominal mass parity of a molecule or ion to the parity of the number of nitrogen atoms ($n_N$) it contains. Let's analyze the contribution of common elements to the nominal mass ($M$) and the total number of electrons ($N_e$) in a neutral molecule.\n-   The mass number ($A$) is the sum of protons ($Z$) and neutrons. The nominal mass of a molecule is the sum of the mass numbers of the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n-   The total number of electrons ($N_e$) in a neutral molecule is the sum of the atomic numbers ($Z$) of its atoms. A molecule is closed-shell if $N_e$ is even, and an odd-electron species (a radical) if $N_e$ is odd.\n\nLet's examine the parity of $A$ and $Z$ for the elements in TEMPO:\n-   Hydrogen ($\\mathrm{^1H}$): $A=1$ (odd), $Z=1$ (odd).\n-   Carbon ($\\mathrm{^{12}C}$): $A=12$ (even), $Z=6$ (even).\n-   Oxygen ($\\mathrm{^{16}O}$): $A=16$ (even), $Z=8$ (even).\n-   Nitrogen ($\\mathrm{^{14}N}$): $A=14$ (even), $Z=7$ (odd).\n\nFor a molecule with formula $\\mathrm{C_xH_yN_{n_N}O_z}$, the parity of the nominal mass $M$ is:\n$M \\pmod 2 \\equiv (x \\cdot 12 + y \\cdot 1 + n_N \\cdot 14 + z \\cdot 16) \\pmod 2 \\equiv (y \\cdot 1) \\pmod 2 \\equiv y \\pmod 2$.\nThe parity of the nominal mass depends only on the parity of the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe parity of the total electron count $N_e$ is:\n$N_e \\pmod 2 \\equiv (x \\cdot 6 + y \\cdot 1 + n_N \\cdot 7 + z \\cdot 8) \\pmod 2 \\equiv (y \\cdot 1 + n_N \\cdot 1) \\pmod 2 \\equiv (y + n_N) \\pmod 2$.\n\n*   **Standard Case (Closed-Shell Neutral Molecule)**: For a stable, closed-shell molecule, $N_e$ must be even. Thus, $(y + n_N)$ must be even. This implies that $y$ and $n_N$ have the same parity. Since $M \\pmod 2 \\equiv y \\pmod 2$, it follows that $M \\pmod 2 \\equiv n_N \\pmod 2$. So, for a closed-shell neutral molecule, mass parity equals nitrogen-count parity. When this molecule is ionized by electron removal (e.g., EI), it forms an **odd-electron** molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$ with the same nominal mass. The standard nitrogen rule—odd mass implies odd $n_N$—is thus formulated for these common **odd-electron ions**.\n\n*   **Radical Case (Odd-Electron Neutral Molecule)**: For a radical like TEMPO, $N_e$ must be odd. Thus, $(y + n_N)$ must be odd. This implies that $y$ and $n_N$ have opposite parity. Since $M \\pmod 2 \\equiv y \\pmod 2$, it follows that $M \\pmod 2 \\not\\equiv n_N \\pmod 2$. For a neutral radical, the mass parity is **opposite** to the nitrogen-count parity.\n\n**2. Analysis of TEMPO**\n\nLet's apply these principles to TEMPO, $\\mathrm{C_9H_{18}NO}$.\n-   $n_N = 1$ (odd).\n-   Number of hydrogens $y=18$ (even).\n-   TEMPO is a neutral radical, so its electron count must be odd. Our formula confirms this: $N_e \\pmod 2 \\equiv (y + n_N) \\pmod 2 \\equiv (18 + 1) \\pmod 2 \\equiv 19 \\pmod 2 \\equiv 1$ (odd).\n-   The nominal mass is $M = 9 \\times 12 + 18 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 14 + 1 \\times 16 = 108 + 18 + 14 + 16 = 156$. The mass is even.\n-   As predicted for a neutral radical, the mass parity (even) is opposite to the nitrogen-count parity (odd).\n\n**3. The Role of Ionization in Mass Spectrometry**\n\nIn a mass spectrometer, we observe ions, not neutral molecules.\n-   If TEMPO is ionized by electron removal (e.g., in Electron Ionization, EI), it forms a cation: $\\mathrm{C_9H_{18}NO} \\rightarrow (\\mathrm{C_9H_{18}NO})^{+} + e^{-}$.\n    -   The neutral molecule is an odd-electron species. Removing one electron results in an **even-electron** cation.\n    -   The nominal mass of this ion is $156$ (even).\n    -   Here we have an **even-electron ion** with an even mass and an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\n\n-   The standard nitrogen rule is formulated for odd-electron ions. A reversed rule applies to even-electron ions: for an even-electron ion, an even mass implies an odd number of nitrogen atoms, and an odd mass implies an even number of nitrogen atoms. Our TEMPO$^{+}$ ion ($M=156$, $n_N=1$) follows this reversed rule.\n\nThe ambiguity arises because an analyst observing a peak at $m/z=156$ (an even mass) does not know *a priori* whether the ion is an odd-electron or even-electron species.\n-   If they assume it's a typical odd-electron molecular ion, they would apply the standard rule and incorrectly conclude that $n_N$ is even.\n-   If they know it originated from a neutral radical and is therefore an even-electron ion, they would apply the reversed rule and correctly conclude that $n_N$ is odd.\n\nTherefore, the parity of the nominal mass alone is insufficient. One must also know the electron parity of the observed ion to choose the correct version of the nitrogen rule.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. TEMPO has nominal mass $156$ (even) but $n_N = 1$ (odd). Because TEMPO is an odd-electron neutral, electron removal by Electron Ionization (EI) produces an even-electron cation of the same nominal mass. The usual nitrogen rule that maps odd nominal mass to odd $n_N$ applies to odd-electron ions; for even-electron ions the mapping reverses. Therefore, without knowing whether the observed ion is odd- or even-electron (and how it was formed), nominal mass parity alone cannot determine $n_N$ for nitroxide radicals.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. It correctly calculates the mass ($156$), identifies the parities of mass (even) and $n_N$ (odd), correctly describes the electron count of the neutral and the resulting cation, and correctly states the dependence of the nitrogen rule on the ion's electron parity. This accurately explains the ambiguity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. TEMPO’s even nominal mass arises because oxygen has an odd nominal mass, which invalidates the nitrogen rule; one must instead correlate parity with the number of oxygen atoms.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The nominal mass of the most abundant isotope of oxygen, $\\mathrm{^{16}O}$, is $16$, which is an even number. The argument is based on a false premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The observed parity is dominated by $\\mathrm{^{15}N}$ isotopic contributions, making the nominal mass parity random in practice; thus the nitrogen rule is unusable for nitroxide radicals without isotopic resolution.**\nThe nitrogen rule is a concept applied to the nominal mass, which is defined by the most abundant isotopes ($\\mathrm{^{14}N}$, not $\\mathrm{^{15}N}$). The natural abundance of $\\mathrm{^{15}N}$ ($\\approx 0.37\\%$) is far too low to \"dominate\" parity. The issue is electronic, not isotopic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The unpaired electron in a nitroxide radical contributes $+1$ to the nominal mass, flipping the parity relative to closed-shell molecules; this extra mass explains why parity cannot be used to infer $n_N$ in nitroxides.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Nominal mass is calculated from the integer masses of protons and neutrons. Electrons have a mass of approximately $1/1836$ atomic mass units and are not counted in the calculation of nominal mass. An electron does not contribute $+1$ to the nominal mass.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3727448"}]}
