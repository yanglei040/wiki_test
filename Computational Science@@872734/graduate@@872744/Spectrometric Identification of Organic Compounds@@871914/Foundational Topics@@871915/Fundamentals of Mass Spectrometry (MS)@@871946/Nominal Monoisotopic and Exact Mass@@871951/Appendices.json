Calculation of nominal mass and mass defect for the identified composition(s), followed by ranking.\n\nFirst, we establish the allowed mass window for the neutral molecule, $\\mathrm{M}$.

Therefore, the number of nitrogen atoms, $z$, must be odd ($z=1, 3, 5, \\dots$).\n2.  **Double Bond Equivalents (DBE)**: The DBE value must be a non-negative integer. The formula is $\\mathrm{DBE} = x - \\frac{y}{2} + \\frac{z}{2} + 1$. For DBE to be an integer, the term $y-z$ must be even.
