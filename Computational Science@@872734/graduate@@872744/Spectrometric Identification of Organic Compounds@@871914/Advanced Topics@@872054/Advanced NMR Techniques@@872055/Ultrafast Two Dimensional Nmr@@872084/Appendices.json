This is mathematically stated as $|\\frac{d\\hat{n}}{dt}| \\ll |\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{eff}}|$, where $\\hat{n}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{eff}}$. This condition is most stringent at resonance ($\\Delta\\omega = 0$), where it simplifies to $\\alpha/\\omega_1 \\ll \\omega_1$, or $\\omega_1^2 \\gg \\alpha$.\n\nA dimensionless adiabatic parameter, $Q$, is defined to quantify this condition. Based on the above inequality, the standard definition is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\omega_1^2}{\\alpha}\n$$\nA large value of $Q$ ($Q \\gg 1$) ensures a highly adiabatic passage, leading to efficient inversion of the spin population.
