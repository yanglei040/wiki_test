Since it is a racemic mixture, it contains equal amounts of the two enantiomers, $A_{R}$ and $A_{S}$.\nThe initial moles of the $R$-enantiomer, $A_{R}$, is:\n$$n_{A_{R}, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{n_{0}}{2} = \\frac{0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{2} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nThe initial moles of the $S$-enantiomer, $A_{S}$, is:\n$$n_{A_{S}, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{n_{0}}{2} = \\frac{0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{2} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nThe amount of the chiral resolving acid, $\\mathrm{RA}$, is given as $0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nThe problem states that complete salt formation occurs. The amine enantiomers react with the resolving acid in a $1:1$ stoichiometric ratio to form two diastereomeric salts, $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$ and $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$.\nThe total amount of $A_{R}$ available is $0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$ and the total amount of $A_{S}$ available is $0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$. The total amount of $\\mathrm{RA}$ is $0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}$, which is sufficient to react with all of the amine.\nTherefore, the total initial amount of each diastereomeric salt formed is:\nTotal moles of $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$ is $n_{R, \\text{total}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\nTotal moles of $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$ is $n_{S, \\text{total}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nThese salts are then equilibrated in a mother liquor of volume $V = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{L}$.

The problem assumes ideal solution behavior and pure solid phases, which implies that the solubility of each diastereomer is independent of the other.\n\nWe first check if there is enough of each salt to saturate the solution. The maximum amount of each salt that can dissolve in the given volume of solvent is:\nFor $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$:\n$$n_{R, \\text{dissolved}} = s_{R} \\times V = (0.050\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.500\\,\\mathrm{L}) = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nFor $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$:\n$$n_{S, \\text{dissolved}} = s_{S} \\times V = (0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.500\\,\\mathrm{L}) = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n\nComparing the total amount of each salt with the amount that can dissolve:\nFor $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$: $n_{R, \\text{total}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol} > n_{R, \\text{dissolved}} = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.

This means the solution will also be saturated with $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$, and some of it will remain as a solid.\n\nThe solid fraction, or filter cake, is composed of the undissolved portion of each diastereomeric salt. We can calculate the amount of each salt in the solid phase by subtracting the dissolved amount from the total amount.\nMoles of solid $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$:\n$$n_{R, \\text{solid}} = n_{R, \\text{total}} - n_{R, \\text{dissolved}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol} - 0.025\\,\\mathrm{mol} = 0.125\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nMoles of solid $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$:\n$$n_{S, \\text{solid}} = n_{S, \\text{total}} - n_{S, \\text{dissolved}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol} - 0.075\\,\\mathrm{mol} = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n\nThe problem states that this solid fraction is isolated and neutralized to regenerate the free amine enantiomers. The process of regeneration liberates the amine from its salt.

The starting material is a racemic mixture of $(R)$-$\\mathrm{A}$ and $(S)$-$\\mathrm{A}$. It is reacted with a single enantiomer of a chiral derivatizing agent, $(R)$-$\\mathrm{C}$. The two reactions are:\n$$ (R)\\text{-A} + (R)\\text{-C} \\xrightarrow{k_{RR}} (R,R)\\text{-product} $$\n$$ (S)\\text{-A} + (R)\\text{-C} \\xrightarrow{k_{SR}} (S,R)\\text{-product} $$\nThe transition states for these two reactions, $\\ce{[A...C]^{\\ddagger}_{R,R}}$ and $\\ce{[A...C]^{\\ddagger}_{S,R}}$, are diastereomeric. Diastereomers have different energies, so their activation energies are different, and consequently, the rate constants are unequal, $k_{RR} \\neq k_{SR}$. This difference in reaction rates is known as **kinetic resolution**.\n\nIf the reaction is stopped at a finite time $t$ before completion, the ratio of the diastereomeric products will be governed by the ratio of their formation rates. Assuming the concentration of the chiral reagent $(R)$-$\\mathrm{C}$ is pseudo-constant or affects both reactions equally, the product ratio is approximately:\n$$ \\frac{[(R,R)\\text{-product}]_t}{[(S,R)\\text{-product}]_t} \\approx \\frac{k_{RR}}{k_{SR}} $$\nAn observed ratio of 70:30 at an early time point simply means that one enantiomer reacts faster than the other, e.g., $k_{RR}/k_{SR} \\approx 70/30$. This will occur even if the starting material is perfectly racemic ($[(R)\\text{-A}]_0 = [(S)\\text{-A}]_0$).\n\nFor the observed ratio to reflect the true enantiomeric composition of the starting material, the reaction must proceed to completion ($100\\%$ conversion). Only then will the final product ratio equal the initial reactant ratio:\n$$ \\frac{[(R,R)\\text{-product}]_\\infty}{[(S,R)\\text{-product}]_\\infty} = \\frac{[(R)\\text{-A}]_0}{[(S)\\text{-A}]_0} $$\nFor a racemic substrate, this ratio must be $1:1$ at completion. The problem provides evidence of an incomplete reaction (persistence of a peak at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{A}}$). The task is to evaluate methods for confirming that this incompleteness is the cause of the non-$1:1$ ratio.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Monitoring the diastereomeric LC–MS peak area ratio as a function of reaction time $t$; if the ratio converges toward $1{:}1$ as $t \\to \\infty$, the initial 70:30 arises from incomplete derivatization with unequal apparent rate constants for the two enantiomers, not true enantiomeric excess.**\n- **Justification:** This statement correctly describes the behavior of a kinetic resolution on a racemic substrate. Initially, the product ratio reflects the kinetic preference ($k_{RR}/k_{SR} \\approx 70/30$). As the reaction proceeds, the faster-reacting enantiomer is consumed more quickly, its concentration drops, and its reaction rate slows down. The slower-reacting enantiomer, now present in relative excess in the unreacted pool, continues to react. As the reaction approaches completion ($t \\to \\infty$ and all of the limiting reagent, the alcohol, is consumed), the final product ratio must reflect the initial ratio of the alcohol enantiomers. Since the starting material is racemic ($1:1$), the final product ratio must converge to $1:1$. If the initial alcohol had a true $70:30$ enantiomeric excess, the product ratio would be $70:30$ at all times, including at completion. Therefore, observing the ratio converge to $1:1$ is a definitive diagnostic test for a kinetic artifact.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. High-resolution MS detection of either an $M{:}M{+}2$ isotope pattern with approximately $3{:}1$ intensity (consistent with a chlorine-containing ion at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{MTPACl}}$) or a strong ion at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{MTPA}}$ lacking the chlorine isotope pattern (consistent with hydrolyzed Mosher acid), contemporaneous with the sample, indicates reagent carryover or decomposition that undermines inference of true enantiomeric excess.**\n- **Justification:** The Mosher's acid chloride reagent, $(R)$-MTPACl, contains one chlorine atom. Natural chlorine consists of $^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}$ and $^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}$ in an approximate $3:1$ ratio, giving any chlorine-containing ion a characteristic $M:M+2$ isotopic signature with $3:1$ intensity. Detecting such a signal at the $m/z$ of MTPACl confirms the presence of unreacted reagent. Mosher's acid chloride is also susceptible to hydrolysis, forming Mosher's acid, $(R)$-MTPA. Detection of an ion at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{MTPA}}$ (which would not have the chlorine isotope pattern) confirms reagent decomposition. The presence of either species implies that the effective concentration of the active reagent is either lower than intended or changing over time, which can lead to an incomplete reaction. An incomplete reaction is the prerequisite for a kinetic resolution artifact. Therefore, observing these reagent-related species provides strong evidence that the reaction conditions are not suitable for a quantitative determination of enantiomeric excess, as the observed ratio might be a kinetic artifact. This undermines any conclusion of true enantiomeric excess.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. In $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ NMR of the crude reaction mixture, the presence of an additional sharp $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ signal beyond the two broader diastereomer resonances which diminishes upon addition of a stoichiometric base, is consistent with residual Mosher acid chloride or its hydrolysis product rather than true enantiomeric excess.**\n- **Justification:** The diastereomeric ester products are large molecules and will tumble relatively slowly in solution, leading to broader NMR signals. The reagent $(R)$-MTPACl and its hydrolysis product $(R)$-MTPA are smaller molecules that tumble faster, leading to sharper NMR signals. Thus, a sharp $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ signal (from the $-\\mathrm{CF}_3$ group) is a hallmark of a reagent-related species. Both the acid chloride and the carboxylic acid hydrolysis product are acidic species (the latter directly, the former via hydrolysis to HCl). Adding a base would neutralize the acid or react with the acid chloride, changing its chemical structure and thus altering or removing its $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ NMR signal. This chemical test confirms the identity of the sharp peak as an acidic, reagent-related species. As explained in B, the presence of such species indicates an incomplete reaction, which is the cause of kinetic artifacts. This observation thus supports the hypothesis that the $70:30$ ratio is an artifact.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. If the sum of integrated LC–MS areas of the two diastereomer peaks at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\Delta m$ equals the integrated area of the underivatized analyte at $m/z = m_{\\mathrmA}}$, then true enantiomeric excess is confirmed.**\n- **Justification:** This statement is flawed for two primary reasons. First, it assumes that the mass spectrometer's response factor is identical for the analyte (an alcohol) and the products (esters). This is almost never true, especially for electrospray ionization (ESI), as ionization efficiency depends heavily on molecular structure and functional groups. Equating peak areas of different chemical species is not a valid way to compare their molar quantities without calibration. Second, even if we were to ignore the response factor issue, the condition states that `Area(products) = Area(unreacted analyte)`. This would imply that the reaction is approximately $50\\%$ complete. A state of partial conversion is precisely where kinetic resolution artifacts are maximized. Therefore, this observation would strongly *support* the possibility of a kinetic artifact, not *confirm* true enantiomeric excess. The logic is inverted and based on an invalid premise.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Equal intensities of the two diastereomeric $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ signals but unequal integrals of the corresponding diastereotopic $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ methoxy signals necessarily indicate instrument nonlinearity and therefore do not reflect any chemical artifact.**\n- **Justification:** This statement is irrelevant and contains incorrect reasoning. The problem states an observed LC-MS ratio of $70:30$. This option hypothesizes an observation of equal $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ signals, which would imply a $1:1$ ratio of diastereomers, contradicting the premise of the problem. Furthermore, if the $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ integrals for the two diastereomers are truly equal, their concentrations must be equal. In a properly acquired quantitative NMR spectrum, the integrals of any other pair of corresponding signals from those same diastereomers (like the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ methoxy signals) must also be equal. A discrepancy between $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ and $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ integrals points to an experimental error in the NMR measurement (e.g., poor baseline, signal overlap, insufficient relaxation delay for the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ experiment), not a fundamental \"instrument nonlinearity\". Most importantly, this scenario is not a diagnostic strategy for the $70:30$ ratio observed in the problem.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Repeating the derivatization under matched partial-conversion conditions with the enantiomeric reagent $(S)$-MTPACl yields a diastereomer ratio of 30:70 (the reciprocal of the original 70:30); this inversion implicates kinetic bias or reagent decomposition rather than true enantiomeric excess in the substrate.**\n- **Justification:** This is a classic and definitive control experiment. Let the reaction with $(R)$-MTPACl give a ratio of $(R,R)\\text{-ester} : (S,R)\\text{-ester} = 70:30$. This implies $k_{RR} > k_{SR}$. Now consider the reaction with $(S)$-MTPACl. The new products are $(R,S)\\text{-ester}$ and $(S,S)\\text{-ester}$. By stereochemical principle, the transition state for $(R)\\text{-A} + (S)\\text{-MTPACl}$ is the enantiomer of the transition state for $(S)\\text{-A} + (R)\\text{-MTPACl}$, so $k_{RS} = k_{SR}$. Similarly, the transition state for $(S)\\text{-A} + (S)\\text{-MTPACl}$ is the enantiomer of that for $(R)\\text{-A} + (R)\\text{-MTPACl}$, so $k_{SS} = k_{RR}$. If the substrate is truly racemic, the new product ratio at partial conversion will be $(S,S)\\text{-ester} : (R,S)\\text{-ester} \\approx k_{SS}/k_{RS} = k_{RR}/k_{SR} = 70:30$. The problem asks for the ratio of the diastereomers, which has now inverted to $30:70$ (minor:major) if the order is kept consistent. This observed inversion of the ratio upon switching the reagent's chirality is a textbook proof of kinetic resolution. If the substrate had a true $70:30$ enantiomeric excess, the product ratio would remain $70:30$ regardless of which enantiomer of the reagent was used (though the chemical identity of the major diastereomer would change).\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCF}$$", "id": "3696435"}]}
