The solution will be derived from the foundational principles of time-periodic Hamiltonians and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.\n\nFirst, we address the origin and positions of spinning sidebands. In MAS NMR, the sample is physically spun at a high angular frequency $\\omega_r$ about an axis oriented at the magic angle with respect to the external magnetic field. This mechanical rotation modulates anisotropic spin interactions (such as chemical shift anisotropy or dipolar coupling) with a period $T_r = 2\\pi/\\omega_r$. According to Floquet theory, a system governed by a time-periodic Hamiltonian possesses a frequency spectrum consisting of a central line and a series of \"sidebands\" positioned at integer multiples of the fundamental modulation frequency. This frequency is the rotor spinning frequency, $\\nu_r = \\omega_r / (2\\pi)$.\n\nThe problem states that the spinning rate is $\\nu_r = \\omega_r / (2\\pi) = 12~\\mathrm{kHz}$. The transmitter frequency is set to the isotropic resonance frequency $\\nu_0$. The frequencies of the observed signals in the spectrum are given by $\\nu = \\nu_0 + n \\nu_r$, where $n$ is an integer known as the sideband order. The frequency offset of the $n$-th sideband relative to the carrier frequency $\\nu_0$ is therefore $\\Delta\\nu_n = \\nu - \\nu_0 = n \\nu_r$.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of Spinning Sideband Frequency Offsets**\n\nWe are asked to determine the set of sideband frequency offsets up to and including order $n=6$. This includes the sidebands for $n = \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 5, \\pm 6$, as well as the centerband at $n=0$. Using the given spinning rate $\\nu_r = 12~\\mathrm{kHz}$:\n\n- For $n=0$ (centerband): $\\Delta\\nu_0 = 0 \\times 12~\\mathrm{kHz} = 0~\\mathrm{kHz}$\n- For $n=\\pm 1$: $\\Delta\\nu_{\\pm 1} = \\pm 1 \\times 12~\\mathrm{kHz} = \\pm 12~\\mathrm{kHz}$\n- For $n=\\pm 2$: $\\Delta\\nu_{\\pm 2} = \\pm 2 \\times 12~\\mathrm{kHz} = \\pm 24~\\mathrm{kHz}$\n- For $n=\\pm 3$: $\\Delta\\nu_{\\pm 3} = \\pm 3 \\times 12~\\mathrm{kHz} = \\pm 36~\\mathrm{kHz}$\n- For $n=\\pm 4$: $\\Delta\\nu_{\\pm 4} = \\pm 4 \\times 12~\\mathrm{kHz} = \\pm 48~\\mathrm{kHz}$\n- For $n=\\pm 5$: $\\Delta\\nu_{\\pm 5} = \\pm 5 \\times 12~\\mathrm{kHz} = \\pm 60~\\mathrm{kHz}$\n- For $n=\\pm 6$: $\\Delta\\nu_{\\pm 6} = \\pm 6 \\times 12~\\mathrm{kHz} = \\pm 72~\\mathrm{kHz}$\n\nThe set of frequency offsets for sidebands up to order $n=6$ is $\\{0, \\pm 12, \\pm 24, \\pm 36, \\pm 48, \\pm 60, \\pm 72\\}~\\mathrm{kHz}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Minimal Spectral Width ($\\mathrm{SW}$)**\n\nThe signal acquisition is performed using complex quadrature detection with a sampling interval $\\Delta t$. This defines a spectral width $\\mathrm{SW} = 1/\\Delta t$. For complex sampling, the resulting spectrum spans a frequency window from $-\\mathrm{SW}/2$ to $+\\mathrm{SW}/2$ relative to the carrier frequency $\\nu_0$.\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem dictates the condition to avoid aliasing (or \"folding\"). For complex signals, aliasing is prevented if all frequency components of the signal lie within the observed spectral window. If a frequency component $\\Delta\\nu$ falls outside the range $[-\\mathrm{SW}/2, +\\mathrm{SW}/2]$, it will be aliased (folded) back into this window. Therefore, to unambiguously observe all frequency components, the spectral width $\\mathrm{SW}$ must be large enough to satisfy the condition:\n$$|\\Delta\\nu| \\le \\frac{\\mathrm{SW}}{2}$$\nfor all frequency offsets $\\Delta\\nu$ present in the signal.\n\nThis is equivalent to stating that the total spectral width must be at least twice the magnitude of the largest frequency offset from the carrier:\n$$\\mathrm{SW} \\ge 2 \\times |\\Delta\\nu|_{\\max}$$\n\nIn this problem, we must accommodate all sidebands up to order $n=6$. The maximum frequency offset magnitude, $|\\Delta\\nu|_{\\max}$, corresponds to the sidebands of order $n=+6$ and $n=-6$:\n$$|\\Delta\\nu|_{\\max} = | \\pm 6 \\times \\nu_r | = 6 \\nu_r$$\n\nSubstituting the given value of the spinning rate, $\\nu_r = 12~\\mathrm{kHz}$:\n$$|\\Delta\\nu|_{\\max} = 6 \\times 12~\\mathrm{kHz} = 72~\\mathrm{kHz}$$\n\nTo avoid aliasing of the $n=\\pm 6$ sidebands, the spectral width must satisfy:\n$$\\mathrm{SW} \\ge 2 \\times |\\Delta\\nu|_{\\max} = 2 \\times 72~\\mathrm{kHz}$$\n$$\\mathrm{SW} \\ge 144~\\mathrm{kHz}$$\n\nThe minimal spectral width, $\\mathrm{SW}_{min}$, is the lowest value that satisfies this condition. Thus, the minimal spectral width required is:\n$$\\mathrm{SW}_{min} = 144~\\mathrm{kHz}$$\n\nThis value has three significant figures, as requested. This spectral width will create a frequency window from $-72~\\mathrm{kHz}$ to $+72~\\mathrm{kHz}$, which precisely accommodates the outermost sidebands of interest at the edges of the window.
