Consider a heteronuclear two-spin system under MAS with spinning frequency $\\nu_{r}$, irradiated by continuous Radio Frequency (RF) spin-lock fields on both channels, with angular nutation frequencies $\\omega_{1I}$ and $\\omega_{1S}$, respectively. Assume both channels are strictly on-resonance (no chemical shift or RF offset), high-power heteronuclear decoupling suppresses homonuclear terms, and the system is well-described by the Rotating Wave Approximation and first-order Average Hamiltonian Theory applied to a time-dependent dipolar Hamiltonian modulated at integer multiples of the rotor frequency $\\omega_{r}=2\\pi \\nu_{r}$.

In this frame, where each spin species' frame rotates at its Larmor frequency, the application of on-resonance spin-locking RF fields makes the spins precess about these fields. The effective Hamiltonian in this doubly rotating frame, considering only the on-resonance RF fields (along the x-axis, by convention) and neglecting other terms for a moment, is given by:\n$$ H_{RF} = -\\omega_{1I} I_x - \\omega_{1S} S_x $$\nHere, $\\omega_{1I}$ and $\\omega_{1S}$ are the angular nutation frequencies, which are proportional to the strength of the applied RF fields for the $I$ and $S$ spins, respectively. In this frame, the energy level splittings for the spins are quantized along the effective fields, leading to energy gaps of $\\hbar\\omega_{1I}$ for spin $I$ and $\\hbar\\omega_{1S}$ for spin $S$.\n\nThe CP polarization transfer is mediated by the heteronuclear dipolar coupling, $H_D$. This transfer is a zero-quantum (ZQ) process, which involves a simultaneous flip-flop of an $I$ spin and an $S$ spin (e.g., $I_x$ state changes from $+\\frac{1}{2}$ to $-\\frac{1}{2}$ while the $S_x$ state changes from $-\\frac{1}{2}$ to $+\\frac{1}{2}$). For this process to be efficient, it must be energy-conserving. In a static solid (no MAS), the energy-conservation requirement dictates that the energy quantum lost by the $I$ spin system must be equal to the energy quantum gained by the $S$ spin system. This leads to the classic Hartmann–Hahn condition:\n$$ \\omega_{1I} = \\omega_{1S} $$\n\nWhen the sample is spun at the magic angle with an angular frequency $\\omega_r = 2\\pi\\nu_r$, the heteronuclear dipolar coupling Hamiltonian $H_D$ becomes time-dependent, as its spatial components are modulated by the sample rotation. This time-dependent Hamiltonian can be described by a Fourier series:\n$$ H_D(t) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_D^{(k)} \\exp(i k \\omega_r t) $$\nwhere the terms $H_D^{(k)}$ are Fourier components of the dipolar Hamiltonian. For a two-spin system, the non-zero components are for $k = \\pm 1, \\pm 2$. This modulation means that the dipolar coupling can exchange energy with the spin system in discrete packets, or quanta, of $n\\hbar\\omega_r$, where $n$ is an integer.\n\nThe energy conservation condition for the ZQ process must now include these possible energy contributions from the mechanical rotation. Efficient polarization transfer occurs when the energy mismatch between the two spin-locked systems, $\\hbar(\\omega_{1I} - \\omega_{1S})$, is exactly compensated by an energy quantum supplied or absorbed from the rotor modulation. This is the condition under which a term in the interaction-frame Hamiltonian becomes stationary, as stipulated by first-order Average Hamiltonian Theory. The condition is therefore:\n$$ \\omega_{1I} - \\omega_{1S} = n \\omega_r $$\nThis is the generalized Hartmann–Hahn matching condition under MAS, where $n$ is an integer ($n = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots$) known as the sideband index. The case $n=0$ corresponds to the static condition, while $n \\neq 0$ corresponds to matching at spinning sidebands.\n\nThe problem asks us to use this derived condition to calculate the S-channel nutation frequency, given a set of parameters. The derived relation is:\n$$ \\omega_{1S} = \\omega_{1I} - n \\omega_r $$\nIt is often more convenient to work with linear frequencies (in units of Hz or kHz). Dividing the entire equation by $2\\pi$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_{1S}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\omega_{1I}}{2\\pi} - n \\frac{\\omega_r}{2\\pi} $$\nLet's define the linear frequencies: $\\nu_{1S} = \\omega_{1S}/2\\pi$, $\\nu_{1I} = \\omega_{1I}/2\\pi$, and $\\nu_{r} = \\omega_{r}/2\\pi$.

The solution will be presented in three sections corresponding to the parts of the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Theoretical Maximum Enhancement Factor**\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the theoretical maximum enhancement factor for ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H} \\rightarrow {}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ cross polarization, starting from the Boltzmann distribution and the principle of Zeeman order conservation. The enhancement factor, $\\epsilon$, is the ratio of the ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ Zeeman magnetization achieved via CP, $M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{CP}}$, to that obtained via a direct single-pulse excitation, $M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{direct}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the equilibrium Zeeman magnetization for a spin species $k$ (where $k$ is either ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ or ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$) from the Boltzmann distribution. In the high-temperature approximation, valid for NMR at all but cryogenic temperatures, the polarization $P_k$, which is the fractional population difference between the two Zeeman levels for a spin-$1/2$ nucleus, is given by:\n$$ P_k = \\frac{N_{\\uparrow} - N_{\\downarrow}}{N_{\\uparrow} + N_{\\downarrow}} \\approx \\frac{\\gamma_k \\hbar B_0}{2 k_B T} $$\nwhere $\\gamma_k$ is the magnetogyric ratio of nucleus $k$, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $B_0$ is the static magnetic field strength, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the sample temperature.\n\nThe equilibrium Zeeman magnetization, $M_{0,k}$, is the net magnetic moment of all $N_k$ spins of type $k$. It is proportional to the number of spins $N_k$, the magnetic moment of a single spin (proportional to $\\gamma_k$), and the polarization $P_k$:\n$$ M_{0,k} \\propto N_k \\gamma_k P_k $$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_k$:\n$$ M_{0,k} \\propto N_k \\gamma_k \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_k \\hbar B_0}{2 k_B T} \\right) \\propto N_k \\gamma_k^2 $$\nThe ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ magnetization from a direct pulse experiment is simply its equilibrium magnetization, $M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{direct}} = M_{0, {}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}$. Thus, the reference magnetization is:\n$$ M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{direct}} \\propto N_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} \\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^2 $$\n\nNext, we analyze the cross-polarization process. The CP experiment begins with the abundant spins (${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, which we denote with subscript H) at thermal equilibrium. Their total polarization, or Zeeman order, is transferred to the rare spins (${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, denoted with subscript N). The problem states that Zeeman order is conserved during the transfer under an ideal Hartmann-Hahn match. This can be interpreted as the initial total polarization of the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ spins being shared among all coupled spins, both ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ and ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$.\nThe total initial polarization available for transfer comes from the $N_{\\text{H}}$ proton spins:\n$$ P_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{H}} P_{\\text{H}} = N_{\\text{H}} \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{H}} \\hbar B_0}{2 k_B T} $$\nThis total polarization is distributed among the entire pool of interacting spins, numbering $N_{\\text{H}} + N_{\\text{N}}$.

The resulting ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ magnetization, $M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{CP}}$, is proportional to the number of ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ spins, their magnetogyric ratio, and this final polarization:\n$$ M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{CP}} \\propto N_{\\text{N}} \\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} P_{\\text{final}} \\propto N_{\\text{N}} \\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} \\left( \\frac{N_{\\text{H}}}{N_{\\text{H}} + N_{\\text{N}}} \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{H}} \\hbar B_0}{2 k_B T} \\right) $$\nThe enhancement factor $\\epsilon$ is the ratio of $M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{CP}}$ to $M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{direct}}$. The magnetization from direct polarization is $M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{direct}} \\propto N_{\\text{N}} \\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} P_{\\text{N}} \\propto N_{\\text{N}} \\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} (\\frac{\\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} \\hbar B_0}{2 k_B T})$.\nTaking the ratio:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{CP}}}{M_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}^{\\text{direct}}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{N}} \\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} \\left( \\frac{N_{\\text{H}}}{N_{\\text{H}} + N_{\\text{N}}} \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{H}} \\hbar B_0}{2 k_B T} \\right)}{N_{\\text{N}} \\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} \\hbar B_0}{2 k_B T} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{N_{\\text{H}}}{N_{\\text{H}} + N_{\\text{N}}} \\gamma_{\\text{H}}}{\\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}} $$\nThe theoretical maximum enhancement occurs under the ideal condition that the proton reservoir is infinitely large compared to the nitrogen reservoir, i.e., $N_{\\text{H}} \\gg N_{\\text{N}}$. In this limit, the factor $\\frac{N_{\\text{H}}}{N_{\\text{H}} + N_{\\text{N}}} \\rightarrow 1$.\nThe enhancement is a positive, scalar quantity, so we take the absolute value of the ratio of the magnetogyric ratios. Thus, the maximum theoretical enhancement factor is:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\text{max}} = \\left| \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{H}}}{\\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}}} \\right| $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nUsing the provided values for the magnetogyric ratios:\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}} / (2\\pi) = 42.577 \\ \\mathrm{MHz/T}$\n$\\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} / (2\\pi) = -4.316 \\ \\mathrm{MHz/T}$\nThe enhancement factor is calculated as the ratio of these values.

At least two distinct physical mechanisms are responsible for this discrepancy.\n\n1.  **Relaxation in the Rotating Frame ($T_{1\\rho}$ Losses):** The derivation assumes a perfect and instantaneous transfer of polarization without any loss. In reality, CP is a process that occurs over a finite contact time, $\\tau_{\\text{CP}}$. During this time, the spin-locked magnetizations of both the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ and ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ nuclei decay back to equilibrium with the lattice, a process characterized by the spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame, $T_{1\\rho}$. The ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ magnetization, which is the source of polarization, decays with a time constant $T_{1\\rho}(\\text{H})$, diminishing the pool of available polarization. Concurrently, the newly generated ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ magnetization decays with its own time constant $T_{1\\rho}(\\text{N})$. The observed ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ signal is the result of a competition between the buildup of polarization (governed by the strength of the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$-${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ dipolar coupling) and the decay due to $T_{1\\rho}$ processes. Because $T_{1\\rho}$ is finite (typically in the millisecond range for protons in solids), the transfer process is inherently lossy, preventing the system from ever reaching the ideal thermodynamic limit.\n\n2.  **Imperfect Hartmann-Hahn Matching and MAS Interference:** The ideal transfer requires satisfying the Hartmann-Hahn condition, $\\omega_{1, \\text{H}} = \\gamma_{\\text{H}} B_{1, \\text{H}} = \\gamma_{{}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} B_{1, {}^{15}\\mathrm{N}} = \\omega_{1, \\text{N}}$, precisely and uniformly throughout the sample. This is practically impossible. First, the radiofrequency fields ($B_1$) are never perfectly homogeneous, meaning different parts of the sample experience a mismatched condition, reducing overall efficiency. Second, and more fundamentally in the context of MAS, the very act of spinning the sample at the magic angle modulates the heteronuclear dipolar couplings that mediate the polarization transfer. This modulation interferes with the static HH condition. Efficient transfer under MAS occurs only when the RF fields satisfy specific rotary-resonance conditions, such as $|\\omega_{1, \\text{H}} - \\omega_{1, \\text{N}}| = n \\cdot \\omega_r$ (for $n=1, 2$), where $\\omega_r$ is the MAS frequency. These matching conditions can be very sharp and difficult to maintain robustly, especially at high MAS speeds, leading to substantial reductions in CP efficiency compared to the theoretical, static-case maximum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.865}$$", "id": "3698279"}, {"introduction": "The intensity of the cross-polarized signal is not static; it evolves over the contact time of the experiment, creating a characteristic 'build-up curve'.
