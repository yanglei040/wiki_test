A solution will be provided.\n\nThe interaction of a nuclear spin with a static magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0$ is described by the Zeeman Hamiltonian. For a magnetic field oriented along the $z$-axis, $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \\hat{k}$, the Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = -\\gamma \\hbar \\hat{I}_z B_0\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\hat{I}_z$ is the spin angular momentum operator along the $z$-axis.\n\nFor a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ nucleus, such as a proton, the spin angular momentum is quantized. The magnetic spin quantum number, $m_I$, can take two values: $m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin-up, denoted by $\\alpha$) and $m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin-down, denoted by $\\beta$). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n$$\nE_{m_I} = -\\gamma \\hbar m_I B_0\n$$\nSince the proton has a positive gyromagnetic ratio ($\\gamma > 0$), the energy level for the spin-up state ($m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}$) is lower than the energy level for the spin-down state ($m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}$).\nThe lower energy level, $E_{\\alpha}$, corresponds to $m_I=+\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\nE_{\\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\hbar B_0\n$$\nThe upper energy level, $E_{\\beta}$, corresponds to $m_I=-\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\nE_{\\beta} = +\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\hbar B_0\n$$\nThe energy difference between these two levels is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{\\beta} - E_{\\alpha} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\hbar B_0\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\hbar B_0\\right) = \\gamma \\hbar B_0\n$$\nAt thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$, the populations of the two energy levels, $N_{\\alpha}$ and $N_{\\beta}$, are governed by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_{\\alpha}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.Substituting the expression for $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_{\\alpha}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma \\hbar B_0}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines the spin polarization $P$ as:\n$$\nP = \\frac{N_{\\alpha} - N_{\\beta}}{N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\beta}}\n$$\nTo express $P$ in terms of the energy difference, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $N_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1 - (N_{\\beta}/N_{\\alpha})}{1 + (N_{\\beta}/N_{\\alpha})}\n$$\nSubstituting the Boltzmann ratio into this expression gives:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma \\hbar B_0}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma \\hbar B_0}{k_{B}T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression can be identified with the hyperbolic tangent function, $\\tanh(x) = \\frac{\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)}{\\exp(x) + \\exp(-x)}$.

The NMR signal is generated by the net magnetization of the sample, which is directly proportional to the population difference between the spin states, $N_{\\alpha} - N_{\\beta}$. This difference is related to the polarization by $N_{\\alpha} - N_{\\beta} = P \\cdot (N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\beta}) = P \\cdot N_{total}$. The calculated polarization $P$ is extremely small (approximately $32$ parts per million). This means that at room temperature, even in a strong magnetic field, the population excess in the lower energy state is minuscule. Since the SNR is proportional to this small population difference, the intrinsic sensitivity of NMR is very low. This low sensitivity is a fundamental challenge in NMR spectroscopy and is the primary reason why signal averaging over many scans is often necessary to achieve an adequate SNR.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.201 \\times 10^{-5}}\n$$", "id": "3719268"}, {"introduction": "In solid samples, orientation-dependent interactions like chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) lead to extremely broad, often featureless spectra, obscuring molecular information.

Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary information for a solution is provided.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\n**2.1. Derivation of Sideband Amplitudes:**\nThe problem states that the instantaneous angular frequency $\\omega(t)$ can be modeled as a carrier frequency $\\omega_0$ plus a sinusoidal modulation. We can write this as:\n$$ \\omega(t) = \\omega_0 + \\Delta\\Omega \\cos(\\omega_r t + \\phi_0) $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\Omega$ is the modulation amplitude, $\\omega_r$ is the rotor angular frequency, and $\\phi_0$ is an arbitrary initial phase of the rotor.\n\nThe observed signal $s(t)$ is the exponential of the integrated phase:\n$$ \\Phi(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\omega(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} \\big(\\omega_0 + \\Delta\\Omega \\cos(\\omega_r \\tau + \\phi_0)\\big) \\,d\\tau $$\n$$ \\Phi(t) = \\omega_0 t + \\left[ \\frac{\\Delta\\Omega}{\\omega_r} \\sin(\\omega_r \\tau + \\phi_0) \\right]_0^t $$\n$$ \\Phi(t) = \\omega_0 t + \\frac{\\Delta\\Omega}{\\omega_r} \\big(\\sin(\\omega_r t + \\phi_0) - \\sin(\\phi_0)\\big) $$\nThe signal is then $s(t) = \\exp(i\\Phi(t))$:\n$$ s(t) = \\exp\\left(i \\left[ \\omega_0 t + \\frac{\\Delta\\Omega}{\\omega_r} \\sin(\\omega_r t + \\phi_0) - \\frac{\\Delta\\Omega}{\\omega_r} \\sin(\\phi_0) \\right]\\right) $$\nLet the modulation index be $\\beta = \\frac{\\Delta\\Omega}{\\omega_r}$. We can rewrite the signal as:\n$$ s(t) = \\exp(-i\\beta \\sin(\\phi_0)) \\exp(i\\omega_0 t) \\exp(i\\beta \\sin(\\omega_r t + \\phi_0)) $$\nThe term $\\exp(-i\\beta \\sin(\\phi_0))$ is a constant phase factor which we can ignore for amplitude calculations. The signal is otherwise a carrier $\\exp(i\\omega_0 t)$ that is phase-modulated. We use the Jacobi-Anger expansion for the phase modulation term:\n$$ \\exp(ix\\sin\\theta) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(x) e^{in\\theta} $$\nwhere $J_n(x)$ are Bessel functions of the first kind of integer order $n$. Applying this to our signal with $x = \\beta$ and $\\theta = \\omega_r t + \\phi_0$:\n$$ s(t) \\propto \\exp(i\\omega_0 t) \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(\\beta) \\exp(in(\\omega_r t + \\phi_0)) $$\n$$ s(t) \\propto \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(\\beta) \\exp(in\\phi_0) \\exp(i(\\omega_0 + n\\omega_r)t) $$\nThis expression shows that the signal is a superposition of components at frequencies $\\omega_0 + n\\omega_r$. These correspond to the centerband ($n=0$) and the spinning sidebands ($n \\neq 0$). The complex amplitude of the $n$th sideband is proportional to $J_n(\\beta) \\exp(in\\phi_0)$. The predicted sideband amplitude is therefore $A_n = J_n(\\beta)$, and its magnitude is $|A_n| = |J_n(\\beta)|$.\n\n**2.2. Calculation of Predicted Magnitudes:**\nFirst, we calculate the modulation index $\\beta$.\nThe CSA modulation amplitude is given as $\\Delta\\Omega = 2\\pi \\cdot 10\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 2\\pi \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\nThe rotor frequency is $\\nu_r = 20\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 2 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe rotor angular frequency is $\\omega_r = 2\\pi \\nu_r = 2\\pi \\cdot (2 \\times 10^4) = 4\\pi \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\nThe modulation index is:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{\\Delta\\Omega}{\\omega_r} = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 10^4}{4\\pi \\times 10^4} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nNow we compute the predicted amplitudes $A_n = J_n(0.5)$ and their magnitudes for $n=0, 1, 2, 3$. For $\\beta=0.5$, the values of $J_n(0.5)$ are positive for $n \\ge 0$, so $A_n = |A_n|$ in these cases.\n- $A_0 = J_0(0.5) \\approx 0.9384698$\n- $A_1 = J_1(0.5) \\approx 0.2422685$\n- $A_2 = J_2(0.5) \\approx 0.0306031$\n- $A_3 = J_3(0.5) \\approx 0.0026021$\n\n**2.3.

We compare the predicted amplitudes $A_n$ with the measured magnitudes $M_n$.\nWe compute the squared differences $(A_n - M_n)^2$:\n- For $n=0$: $(0.9384698 - 0.9390)^2 = (-0.0005302)^2 \\approx 2.811 \\times 10^{-7}$\n- For $n=1$: $(0.2422685 - 0.2410)^2 = (0.0012685)^2 \\approx 1.609 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- For $n=2$: $(0.0306031 - 0.0300)^2 = (0.0006031)^2 \\approx 3.637 \\times 10^{-7}$\n- For $n=3$: $(0.0026021 - 0.00255)^2 = (0.0000521)^2 \\approx 2.714 \\times 10^{-9}$\n\nNow, we sum these squared differences:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{3}(A_{n}-M_{n})^{2} \\approx (2.811 \\times 10^{-7}) + (1.609 \\times 10^{-6}) + (3.637 \\times 10^{-7}) + (2.714 \\times 10^{-9}) $$\n$$ \\sum \\approx 0.0000002811 + 0.000001609 + 0.0000003637 + 0.000000002714 \\approx 0.0000022565 $$\nNow, we apply the full RMSD formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.0000022565} = \\sqrt{0.000000564125} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSD} \\approx 0.00075108 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.0007511$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0007511}$$", "id": "3719252"}, {"introduction": "A typical solid-state NMR experiment combines multiple techniques to simplify complex spectra and isolate the information of interest.

This technique averages the spatial part of anisotropic interactions.\n-   The term $(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$ in the dipolar Hamiltonian is averaged to zero by MAS. Thus, MAS effectively removes a large part of the heteronuclear dipolar broadening.\n-   The scalar coupling Hamiltonian, $\\mathcal{H}_J^{(sec)} = 2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{IS}} I_z S_z$, has no spatial dependence. It is isotropic. **Therefore, MAS has no effect on the scalar $J$-coupling.** If MAS were the only technique applied (and $\\nu_r$ was fast enough to average the dipolar coupling), a doublet with splitting $J$ would be observed.\n\nB. **Effect of High-Power $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ Decoupling**: The problem states that high-power, continuous $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupling is applied during $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ acquisition. This involves applying a strong radio-frequency (RF) field to the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ (S) spins.\n-   The strong RF field forces the $S$ spins to precess rapidly about the RF field axis, effectively scrambling their spin states ($+1/2$ and $-1/2$) on a timescale much shorter than the inverse of the coupling strengths.\n-   From the perspective of the $I$ spin ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$), the $z$-component of the $S$ spin averages to zero: $\\langle S_z \\rangle \\to 0$.\n-   Let's examine the effect of this averaging on the coupling Hamiltonians:\n    -   Dipolar Coupling: $\\mathcal{H}_D^{(sec)} \\propto I_z S_z$. Since $\\langle S_z \\rangle \\to 0$, this entire interaction is averaged to zero. This is the primary purpose of decoupling: to remove the large dipolar splittings.\n    -   Scalar Coupling: $\\mathcal{H}_J^{(sec)} = 2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{IS}} I_z S_z$. Since this interaction is also proportional to $S_z$, it is **also averaged to zero** by the decoupling field.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe simultaneous application of MAS and high-power $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupling has the following consequences:\n-   MAS averages the anisotropic part of the dipolar coupling.\n-   High-power decoupling averages to zero all interactions proportional to $S_z$, which includes **both** the residual dipolar coupling and the isotropic scalar $J$-coupling.\nAs a result, the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ nucleus is effectively \"decoupled\" from the proton, and its signal collapses from a potential multiplet to a singlet. No $J$-splitting will be resolved.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A resolved doublet with splitting approximately equal to $J$ will be observed, because scalar $J$ is isotropic and MAS does not average it; $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupling removes only dipolar couplings.**\nThis statement correctly identifies that $J$-coupling is isotropic and not averaged by MAS. However, its central claim that \"$^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupling removes only dipolar couplings\" is false. Standard high-power decoupling schemes average the $S_z$ operator, which removes any interaction of the form $C \\cdot I_z S_z$, irrespective of whether the coefficient $C$ is isotropic (like $2\\pi J$) or anisotropic (like the dipolar term). Therefore, the $J$-coupling is also removed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. No resolved $J$-splitting will be observed; the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ lines appear as singlets because continuous $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupling averages the heteronuclear $J$ interaction to near zero on the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ channel, leaving at most minor residual broadening $\\ll J$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the outcome. It correctly identifies that continuous $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupling is the mechanism responsible for averaging the $J$-coupling to zero. As a consequence, the multiplet structure collapses, and the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signal is observed as a singlet. The mention of potential minor residual broadening is a physically correct acknowledgement of the non-ideality of real-world experiments.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. A partially resolved multiplet will appear with an apparent splitting scaled by $\\nu_r/J$, because MAS rotor modulation scales isotropic interactions; the effective spacing is about $0.071\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect on multiple points. First, MAS averages *anisotropic* interactions, not *isotropic* ones like $J$-coupling. Second, the scaling factor it proposes, $\\nu_r/J$, is baseless in this context. Third, the numerical value $0.071\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ does not seem to derive from the given parameters in any logical way ($10000/140 \\approx 71.4$; $140/10000 = 0.014$). The core physical principle invoked is wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The $J$-splitting will be redistributed into spinning sidebands separated by $\\nu_r$, so it is not seen at the centerband but appears as multiplet structure on the sidebands.**\nThis statement describes the behavior of *anisotropic* interactions under MAS when the spinning speed is comparable to or smaller than the interaction strength. Since $J$-coupling is isotropic, it is not modulated by sample rotation and therefore does not produce spinning sidebands. Furthermore, even if one considered the very small anisotropic component of the $J$-tensor, the overwhelming effect of high-power decoupling would average the entire interaction to zero anyway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3719305"}]}
