It describes a standard two-spin AX system in NMR, a fundamental topic in spectrometric analysis. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for a symbolic derivation.\n\nWe begin by establishing the spin Hamiltonian for the isolated two-spin, spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ AX system. The system consists of two spins, labeled $I$ and $S$, in a static magnetic field $\\vec{B_0} = B_0 \\hat{k}$ along the $z$-axis. The total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is the sum of the Zeeman interaction term $\\hat{H}_Z$ and the scalar coupling term $\\hat{H}_J$.\n\nThe Zeeman Hamiltonian describes the interaction of the spins with the external magnetic field:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_Z = -\\gamma_I \\hbar B_0 \\hat{I}_z - \\gamma_S \\hbar B_0 \\hat{S}_z\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma_I$ and $\\gamma_S$ are the gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclei, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\hat{I}_z$ and $\\hat{S}_z$ are the operators for the $z$-component of the spin angular momentum for spins $I$ and $S$, respectively. In NMR spectroscopy, it is conventional to work with positive Larmor angular frequencies, defined as $\\omega_k = |\\gamma_k B_0|$.

NMR transitions are induced by an oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to $\\vec{B_0}$. The magnetic dipole selection rules for observing transitions of a specific spin, say $I$, are $\\Delta m_I = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m_S = 0$. This means spin $S$ is a spectator; its spin state does not change during the transition of spin $I$. We consider absorptive transitions, where the system goes from a lower energy state to a higher one. For $\\gamma > 0$, states with $m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}$ are lower in energy than those with $m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, we look for transitions from a state with $m_I=+\\frac{1}{2}$ to a state with $m_I=-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThere are two such transitions possible for spin $I$:\n1.  Transition when spin $S$ is in the $\\alpha$ state ($m_S = +\\frac{1}{2}$). This is a transition from state $|\\alpha\\alpha\\rangle$ (state $1$) to state $|\\beta\\alpha\\rangle$ (state $3$).

Transition when spin $S$ is in the $\\beta$ state ($m_S = -\\frac{1}{2}$). This is a transition from state $|\\alpha\\beta\\rangle$ (state $2$) to state $|\\beta\\beta\\rangle$ (state $4$). The transition angular frequency $\\omega_{I,2}$ is:\n    $$ \\omega_{I,2} = \\frac{E_4 - E_2}{\\hbar} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_I + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_S + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi J\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_I + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_S - \\frac{1}{2}\\pi J\\right) $$\n    $$ \\omega_{I,2} = \\omega_I + \\pi J $$\n\nThus, the spectrum for spin $I$ consists of a doublet centered at $\\omega_I$ with a splitting of $2\\pi J$ (rad/s), or $J$ (Hz).

In the high-temperature approximation, this can be linearized: $p_i \\approx C(1 - E_i / k_B T)$, where $C$ is a normalization constant.\nFor simplicity, we can express the populations relative to a baseline, ignoring constant offsets and scaling factors as we are interested in a ratio of intensities.

Thus, we have the correspondence $4\\Delta_A \\equiv 1$.\n\n**3. Intensity of the Decoupled Spectrum**\n\nIn the decoupling experiment, a continuous-wave field is applied to spin $X$, which removes the coupling term $2\\pi J_{AX} I_{Az} I_{Xz}$ from the effective Hamiltonian. This causes the two transitions for spin $A$ to become degenerate, collapsing the doublet into a single line. The problem states that the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) and cross-relaxation are negligible. This is a critical condition. The NOE is a change in the integrated intensity of a spin's resonance due to population transfers that occur upon saturation of a coupled spin. Negligible cross-relaxation means that the mechanisms for such population transfers are absent. Therefore, the application of the decoupling field to spin $X$ does not perturb the thermal equilibrium populations of the spin system's energy levels.\n\nThe single line in the decoupled spectrum corresponds to the transition of spin $A$ from its $\\beta$ state to its $\\alpha$ state, irrespective of the state of spin $X$. The principle of \"additivity of integrated intensities under line coalescence,\" mentioned in the problem, implies that the intensity of the collapsed singlet is proportional to the total population difference between all $m_A = -1/2$ states and all $m_A = +1/2$ states.\nThe total population of $A$ spins in the $\\beta$ state is $p_{\\beta, total} = p_{\\beta\\alpha} + p_{\\beta\\beta}$.\nThe total population of $A$ spins in the $\\alpha$ state is $p_{\\alpha, total} = p_{\\alpha\\alpha} + p_{\\alpha\\beta}$.\nThe integrated area of the decoupled singlet, $A_{dec}$, is proportional to this total population difference:\n$$A_{dec} \\propto p_{\\beta, total} - p_{\\alpha, total} = (p_{\\beta\\alpha} + p_{\\beta\\beta}) - (p_{\\alpha\\alpha} + p_{\\alpha\\beta})$$\nSubstituting the population expressions:\n$$p_{\\beta\\alpha} + p_{\\beta\\beta} = (p_0 - \\Delta_A + \\Delta_X) + (p_0 - \\Delta_A - \\Delta_X) = 2p_0 - 2\\Delta_A$$\n$$p_{\\alpha\\alpha} + p_{\\alpha\\beta} = (p_0 + \\Delta_A + \\Delta_X) + (p_0 + \\Delta_A - \\Delta_X) = 2p_0 + 2\\Delta_A$$\nThus, the intensity of the decoupled line is:\n$$A_{dec} \\propto (2p_0 - 2\\Delta_A) - (2p_0 + 2\\Delta_A) = -4\\Delta_A$$\nThe integrated area is proportional to the magnitude:\n$$A_{dec} \\propto |-4\\Delta_A| = 4\\Delta_A$$\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the results, we find that the total integrated area of the non-decoupled doublet and the integrated area of the decoupled singlet are proportional to the same quantity:\n$$A_{nd} \\propto 4\\Delta_A$$\n$$A_{dec} \\propto 4\\Delta_A$$\nTherefore, their integrated areas are equal: $A_{dec} = A_{nd}$.\nThe problem states that the sum of the integrated areas of the doublet components in the non-decoupled spectrum is normalized to $1$. So, $A_{nd} = 1$.\nThis directly implies that the integrated area of the singlet in the decoupled spectrum is also $1$.\n$$A_{dec} = 1$$\nThe question asks for the ratio of the decoupled area to the non-decoupled area, which is $A_{dec} / A_{nd} = 1 / 1 = 1$.\nThis result fundamentally arises from the conservation of total $z$-polarization of spin $A$ under the condition of negligible cross-relaxation (NOE). The total transverse magnetization created by the pulse, and thus the total integrated signal intensity, is conserved.
