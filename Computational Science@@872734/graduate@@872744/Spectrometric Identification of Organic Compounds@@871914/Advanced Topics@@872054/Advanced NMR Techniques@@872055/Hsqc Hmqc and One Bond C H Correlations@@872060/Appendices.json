We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two key sampling parameters for a $2\\mathrm{D}$ NMR experiment: the sampling increment in the indirect dimension, $\\Delta t_1$, and the total indirect evolution time, $T_{1,\\max}$. These parameters are determined by the desired spectral width, $\\mathrm{SW}_C$, and frequency resolution, $\\Delta \\nu_C$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we determine the sampling increment $\\Delta t_1$. The problem specifies \"conventional hypercomplex sampling\" for the indirect ($t_1$) dimension. This method, such as States-TPPI, collects complex data points to allow for sign discrimination (quadrature detection) in the indirect frequency dimension ($\\omega_1$). According to the Nyquist sampling theorem for complex signals, the spectral width ($\\mathrm{SW}$) that can be unambiguously observed is equal to the sampling frequency ($f_s$). The sampling increment, $\\Delta t$, is the reciprocal of the sampling frequency. For the indirect dimension, this relationship is:\n$$ \\mathrm{SW}_C = f_{s,1} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_1} $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{SW}_C$ is the spectral width for the carbon-13 nucleus and $\\Delta t_1$ is the time increment between successive points in the indirect evolution period.\n\nWe are given the carbon-13 sweep width as $\\mathrm{SW}_C = 30.0\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$. We must convert this value to base units of Hertz ($\\mathrm{Hz}$ or $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$):\n$$ \\mathrm{SW}_C = 30.0 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 30000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nUsing the relationship derived from the sampling theorem, we can solve for $\\Delta t_1$:\n$$ \\Delta t_1 = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{SW}_C} = \\frac{1}{30.0 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 3.3333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$). We perform the conversion:\n$$ \\Delta t_1 = (3.3333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{ms}}{1\\ \\mathrm{s}}\\right) \\approx 0.033333\\ \\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta t_1 = 0.03333\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nNext, we determine the total indirect evolution time, $T_{1,\\max}$. The problem states that the resolution is \"transform-limited,\" which means we neglect the natural linewidth of the signals and any line broadening from data processing. In this ideal case, the frequency resolution ($\\Delta \\nu$) achievable from a Fourier transform is determined by the total acquisition time ($T$) of the signal. The fundamental time-frequency duality of the Fourier transform dictates that the minimum distinguishable frequency separation is the reciprocal of the total observation time. For the indirect dimension, this is:\n$$ \\Delta \\nu_C = \\frac{1}{T_{1,\\max}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta \\nu_C$ is the desired frequency resolution and $T_{1,\\max}$ is the maximum evolution time in the $t_1$ period.\n\nWe are given the target resolution $\\Delta \\nu_C = 15.0\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. We can now solve for $T_{1,\\max}$:\n$$ T_{1,\\max} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta \\nu_C} = \\frac{1}{15.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.066667\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nConverting this value to milliseconds:\n$$ T_{1,\\max} = (0.066667\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{ms}}{1\\ \\mathrms}\\right) \\approx 66.667\\ \\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $T_{1,\\max} = 66.67\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe two calculated parameters are $\\Delta t_1 = 0.03333\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ and $T_{1,\\max} = 66.67\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. The number of increments, $N_1$, in the indirect dimension would be $T_{1,\\max} / \\Delta t_1 = (0.066667\\ \\mathrm{s}) / (3.3333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 2000$.\n\nThe discussion on trade-offs with relaxation is as follows. The HSQC and HMQC pulse sequences include a variable evolution period, $t_1$, during which $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ transverse magnetization evolves. This magnetization is subject to decay governed by the transverse relaxation time constant, $T_2$. The calculated value of $T_{1,\\max} = 66.67\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ represents the maximum duration of this evolution period.\n\nThe primary trade-off is between the desired resolution and signal sensitivity. To achieve a high resolution (small $\\Delta \\nu_C$), a long acquisition time ($T_{1,\\max}$) is required. However, if $T_{1,\\max}$ is comparable to or longer than the $T_2$ of the carbon nuclei, the signal will have significantly decayed by the time the final increments of $t_1$ are recorded. This leads to two adverse effects:\n1.  **Reduced Sensitivity**: The overall signal-to-noise ratio diminishes because a large portion of the collected data (at high $t_1$ values) contains very little signal.\n2.  **Line Broadening**: The signal decay during $t_1$ acts as a natural window function (an exponential decay). This decay leads to broadening of the peaks in the frequency domain, with the fundamental linewidth limited by $1/(\\pi T_2^*)$, where $T_2^*$ includes magnetic field inhomogeneity effects. If the acquisition time $T_{1,\\max}$ is extended far beyond $T_2$, the resolution does not improve further and is ultimately limited by relaxation, while sensitivity continues to decrease. Therefore, there is a practical limit to the useful acquisition time, and the theoretical resolution of $15.0\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ may not be achievable if the natural linewidth of the carbon signals is larger than this value.\n\nA secondary consideration involves the longitudinal relaxation time, $T_1$. The total duration of the 2D experiment is proportional to the number of $t_1$ increments. A large number of increments, such as the $2000$ calculated here, leads to a very long total experiment time, especially when coupled with a recycle delay between scans that must be long enough (typically $3-5$ times the proton $T_1$) to allow for full magnetization recovery. This makes experiments aiming for very high resolution in the indirect dimension impractically long.\n\nIn summary, the quest for high resolution by increasing $T_{1,\\max}$ is fundamentally constrained by transverse ($T_2$) relaxation, which degrades both sensitivity and the practically achievable resolution, and secondarily constrained by longitudinal ($T_1$) relaxation, which dictates the minimum recycle delay and thus contributes to a prohibitively long total experiment time.\n\nThe final answers for $\\Delta t_1$ and $T_{1,\\max}$ in milliseconds are presented in a row matrix, in that order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.03333 & 66.67 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3707418"}, {"introduction": "In a real molecule, not all C-H pairs have the same one-bond coupling constant, $^{1}J_{CH}$.

We wish to maximize $f(\\Delta)$.\nLet the phase of the sine function be $\\theta(J, \\Delta) = 2\\pi J \\Delta$. As $J$ varies from $J_{\\min}$ to $J_{\\max}$, the phase $\\theta$ sweeps the interval $[\\theta_{\\min}, \\theta_{\\max}]$, where $\\theta_{\\min} = 2\\pi J_{\\min} \\Delta$ and $\\theta_{\\max} = 2\\pi J_{\\max} \\Delta$.\n\nThe function $|\\sin(\\theta)|$ becomes zero whenever $\\theta$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. If the interval $[\\theta_{\\min}, \\theta_{\\max}]$ contains a value $m\\pi$ for some integer $m$, the minimum transfer amplitude will be zero. This corresponds to a null in the transfer for a specific coupling constant within the range, which is the worst possible outcome for robustness. To avoid this, we must choose $\\Delta$ such that the open interval $(\\theta_{\\min}, \\theta_{\\max})$ contains no integer multiples of $\\pi$. This means there must exist an integer $m$ such that the entire phase interval is contained within $[m\\pi, (m+1)\\pi]$:\n$$ m\\pi \\le 2\\pi J_{\\min} \\Delta \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2\\pi J_{\\max} \\Delta \\le (m+1)\\pi $$\n$$ \\frac{m}{2J_{\\min}} \\le \\Delta \\le \\frac{m+1}{2J_{\\max}} $$\nFor a valid range of $\\Delta$ to exist, we must have $\\frac{m}{2J_{\\min}} \\le \\frac{m+1}{2J_{\\max}}$, which simplifies to $m(J_{\\max} - J_{\\min}) \\le J_{\\min}$.

Thus, possible integer values for $m$ are $m=0$ and $m=1$.\n\nWithin such an interval $[m\\pi, (m+1)\\pi]$, the function $|\\sin(\\theta)|$ has a single maximum at $\\theta = (m+1/2)\\pi$ and is zero at the endpoints. The minimum value of $|\\sin(\\theta)|$ over the sub-interval $[\\theta_{\\min}, \\theta_{\\max}]$ must therefore occur at one of the endpoints, $J_{\\min}$ or $J_{\\max}$.\n$$ f(\\Delta) = \\min(|\\sin(2\\pi J_{\\min} \\Delta)|, |\\sin(2\\pi J_{\\max} \\Delta)|) $$\nTo maximize this minimum value, we should choose $\\Delta$ such that the amplitudes at the endpoints are equal:\n$$ |\\sin(2\\pi J_{\\min} \\Delta)| = |\\sin(2\\pi J_{\\max} \\Delta)| $$\nThis implies $2\\pi J_{\\min} \\Delta = p\\pi \\pm 2\\pi J_{\\max} \\Delta$ for some integer $p$.

The second case ensures that the phases $\\theta_{\\min}$ and $\\theta_{\\max}$ are positioned symmetrically with respect to a multiple of $\\pi/2$, which is the desired condition for maximizing the minimum amplitude.

We must choose $p$ to maximize this value, subject to the constraint that no integer multiple of $\\pi$ lies strictly between $\\theta_{\\min}$ and $\\theta_{\\max}$. That is, for any integer $k$, it's not the case that $\\frac{3p}{8} < k < \\frac{5p}{8}$.\n\nLet's test integer values for $p$:\n- If $p=1$: The phases are $[3\\pi/8, 5\\pi/8]$. The interval $(3/8, 5/8)$ contains no integers. This is a valid choice. The worst-case amplitude is $|\\sin(3\\pi/8)| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\approx 0.9239$.\n- If $p=2$: The phase interval is $[3\\pi/4, 5\\pi/4]$. The interval $(3/4, 5/4) = (0.75, 1.25)$ contains the integer $k=1$. Thus, for $J=160 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$, the phase is $2\\pi(160) \\frac{2}{640} = \\pi$, leading to zero amplitude. This choice is invalid.\n- If $p=3$: The phases are $[9\\pi/8, 15\\pi/8]$. The interval $(9/8, 15/8)=(1.125, 1.875)$ contains no integers. This is a valid choice. The worst-case amplitude is $|\\sin(9\\pi/8)| = |-\\sin(\\pi/8)| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\approx 0.3827$.\n\nComparing the valid choices, $p=1$ yields a much higher worst-case amplitude than $p=3$. Higher values of $p$ will result in wider phase intervals, which are more likely to contain nulls, or will yield amplitudes that are no better than for smaller $p$. Therefore, the optimal choice is $p=1$.\n\nThe optimal compromise delay is:\n$$ \\Delta^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{2(J_{\\min} + J_{\\max})} = \\frac{1}{640} \\, \\mathrm{s} $$\nConverting to milliseconds:\n$$ \\Delta^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{640} \\times 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ms} = 1.5625 \\, \\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $\\Delta^{\\star} = 1.563 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**Step 4: Quantifying Transfer Amplitudes and Impact on HSQC**\n\nWith $\\Delta^{\\star} = 1/640 \\, \\mathrm{s}$:\n- At $J_{\\min}=120 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$, the one-step amplitude is $|\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 120 / 640)| = |\\sin(3\\pi/8)| \\approx 0.9239$.\n- At $J_{\\max}=200 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$, the one-step amplitude is $|\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 200 / 640)| = |\\sin(5\\pi/8)| = |\\sin(3\\pi/8)| \\approx 0.9239$.\nThis represents approximately $92.4\\%$ of the maximum possible transfer amplitude ($1.0$). The maximum amplitude is achieved when $2\\pi J \\Delta^{\\star} = \\pi/2$, which occurs at $J = 1/(4\\Delta^{\\star}) = 640/4 = 160 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nAn HSQC experiment involves two INEPT-based transfer steps (forward and backward). The total signal intensity for a given correlation is proportional to the product of the efficiencies of both steps, i.e., proportional to $\\sin^2(2\\pi J \\Delta)$. Since maximizing $|\\sin(\\theta)|$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, the delay $\\Delta^{\\star}$ that maximizes the worst-case one-step amplitude also maximizes the worst-case overall HSQC signal intensity.\n\nFor this choice of $\\Delta^{\\star}$, the overall HSQC efficiency will range from a minimum of $\\sin^2(3\\pi/8) = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\approx 0.8536$ (at the endpoints $J=120$ and $200 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$) to a maximum of $\\sin^2(\\pi/2) = 1$ (at $J=160 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$).

The sum is $\\frac{1-r^{N_{t1}}}{1-r}$.\n    $$\n    H = N_{\\mathrm{scans}} A \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{N_{t1} \\Delta t_1}{T_{2,C}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t_1}{T_{2,C}}\\right)}\n    $$\n\n*   **RMS Noise in the Frequency Domain ($\\sigma_{FD}$):**\n    The time-domain noise is i.i.d. Gaussian with RMS value $\\sigma_0$ per complex point per scan.\n    After co-adding $N_{\\mathrm{scans}}$, the random noise adds in quadrature. The RMS noise of the summed time-domain data at each point, $\\sigma_{TD}$, is:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{TD} = \\sigma_0 \\sqrt{N_{\\mathrm{scans}}}\n    $$\n    The DFT is a linear transformation. For i.i.d. input noise with variance $\\sigma_{TD}^2$, the variance of any point in the output spectrum (due to Parseval's theorem for unnormalized DFT or direct calculation) is the sum of the variances of the input points:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{Var}(\\text{Noise}_{FD}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t1}-1} \\mathrm{Var}(\\text{Noise}_{TD}) = N_{t1} \\sigma_{TD}^2 = N_{t1} (\\sigma_0 \\sqrt{N_{\\mathrm{scans}}})^2 = N_{t1} \\sigma_0^2 N_{\\mathrm{scans}}\n    $$\n    The RMS noise $\\sigma_{FD}$ is the square root of the variance:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{FD} = \\sqrt{N_{t1} \\sigma_0^2 N_{\\mathrm{scans}}} = \\sigma_0 \\sqrt{N_{t1} N_{\\mathrm{scans}}}\n    $$\n\n*   **SNR Expression:**\n    Combining the expressions for $H$ and $\\sigma_{FD}$:\n    $$\n    SNR = \\frac{H}{\\sigma_{FD}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{scans}} A}{\\sigma_0 \\sqrt{N_{t1} N_{\\mathrm{scans}}}} \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{N_{t1} \\Delta t_1}{T_{2,C}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t_1}{T_{2,C}}\\right)}\n    $$\n    Simplifying the dependence on $N_{\\mathrm{scans}}$:\n    $$\n    SNR = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{\\mathrm{scans}}} A}{\\sigma_0 \\sqrt{N_{t1}}} \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\fracN_{t1} \\Delta t_1}{T_{2,C}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t_1}{T_{2,C}}\\right)}\n    $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the minimal number of scans $N_{\\mathrm{scans}}$**\n\nWe require $SNR \\geq SNR^*$, where $SNR^* = 1.2 \\times 10^{1} = 12$.
