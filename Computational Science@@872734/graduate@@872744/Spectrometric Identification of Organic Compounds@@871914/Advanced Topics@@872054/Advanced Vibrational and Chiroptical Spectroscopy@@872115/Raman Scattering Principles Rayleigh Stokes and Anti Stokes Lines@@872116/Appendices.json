The derivation shall proceed from the fundamental principle of energy conservation during the inelastic scattering process.\n\nRaman scattering is an inelastic phenomenon where a photon interacts with a molecule, resulting in a change in the molecule's rovibrational energy state and a corresponding change in the scattered photon's energy. The total energy of the system (photon + molecule) is conserved. Let $E_{inc}$ be the energy of the incident photon, $E_{sc}$ be the energy of the scattered photon, and $E_{i,mol}$ and $E_{f,mol}$ be the initial and final vibrational energies of the molecule, respectively. The conservation of energy is expressed as:\n$$E_{inc} + E_{i,mol} = E_{sc} + E_{f,mol}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the scattered photon's energy in terms of the incident photon's energy and the change in the molecule's energy, $\\Delta E_{mol} = E_{f,mol} - E_{i,mol}$:\n$$E_{sc} = E_{inc} - \\Delta E_{mol}$$\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ by the equation $E = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. Substituting this into the energy conservation equation yields:\n$$hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{sc} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\Delta E_{mol}$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{sc} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\frac{\\Delta E_{mol}}{hc}$$\nThe problem models the molecular vibration as a quantum harmonic oscillator. The allowed energy transitions for Raman scattering are typically $\\Delta v = \\pm 1$. The energy difference between adjacent vibrational levels is quantized and given by $\\Delta E_{vib} = h\\nu_{vib} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$, where $\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$ is the wavenumber of the molecular vibration.\n\nThere are two cases for inelastic scattering:\n\n1.  **Stokes Scattering**: The molecule is initially in a lower energy state (typically the ground vibrational state, $v=0$) and is excited to a higher energy state ($v=1$) by the interaction. The molecule absorbs energy from the incident photon.\n    In this case, $\\Delta E_{mol} = E_{f,mol} - E_{i,mol} = +hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$.

The molecule transfers its excess vibrational energy to the scattered photon.\n    In this case, $\\Delta E_{mol} = E_{f,mol} - E_{i,mol} = -hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$. The scattered photon, denoted with subscript $aS$ for anti-Stokes, has higher energy.\n    The wavenumber of the anti-Stokes-scattered photon, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS}$, is:\n    $$\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\frac{(-hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{vib})}{hc}$$\n    $$\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} + \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}$$\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in units of $\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ in units of $\\text{nm}$:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{10^7}{\\lambda} \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\lambda = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}}$$\nUsing this relationship, we can express the wavelengths of the scattered photons.\nThe Stokes wavelength, $\\lambda_S$, is:\n$$\\lambda_{S} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{S}} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}}$$\nThe anti-Stokes wavelength, $\\lambda_{aS}$, is:\n$$\\lambda_{aS} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{aS}} = \\frac{10^7}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{inc} + \\tilde{\\nu}_{vib}}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values.\nThe incident laser has a wavelength $\\lambda_{inc} = 532\\,\\text{nm}$.

Let the sample have a vibrational mode with a characteristic wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}$. In Raman spectroscopy, the quantity of interest is the Raman shift, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$, defined as the difference between the incident and scattered wavenumbers: $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{scattered}}$. By convention, the wavenumber of the vibrational mode itself is used to label the Raman shift.\n\n2.  **Rayleigh Scattering**:\n    This is an elastic process where the scattered light has the same energy and wavenumber as the incident light, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{scattered}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0$. The Raman shift is therefore $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = 0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The notch filter is centered at this position to reject the intense, unshifted laser light.\n\n3.  **Stokes Scattering**:\n    This is an inelastic process where the incident photon transfers energy to the sample, creating a quantum of vibrational energy. The sample transitions from a lower energy state (e.g., vibrational ground state $v=0$) to a higher energy state (e.g., first excited state $v=1$). The scattered photon emerges with lower energy and a lower wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}$. This corresponds to a positive Raman shift:\n    $$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}) = +\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}} $$\n    The Stokes signal appears on the low-energy (low-wavenumber, long-wavelength) side of the Rayleigh line.\n\n4.  **Anti-Stokes Scattering**:\n    This is an inelastic process where the sample, already in a vibrationally excited state (e.g., $v=1$), transfers its energy to the incident photon upon scattering. The sample transitions to a lower energy state (e.g., $v=0$). The scattered photon emerges with higher energy and a higher wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}$. This corresponds to a negative Raman shift:\n    $$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}) = -\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}} $$\n    The anti-Stokes signal appears on the high-energy (high-wavenumber, short-wavelength) side of the Rayleigh line. The existence of an anti-Stokes signal depends on a non-zero thermal population of the excited vibrational state, which is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. At $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, low-wavenumber modes like the one specified have a significant population in the excited state, making the anti-Stokes signal observable in principle.\n\n5.  **Application to the Specific Problem**:\n    - The Raman-active lattice mode is given at $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    - The Stokes line will therefore appear at a Raman shift of $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = +120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    - The anti-Stokes line will appear at a Raman shift of $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{anti-Stokes}} = -120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n6.  **Analysis of the Notch Filter Constraint**:\n    - The filter's stopband \"fully rejects all light within a wavenumber shift of $\\pm 200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ relative to the excitation line\".\n    - This means any light corresponding to a Raman shift $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$ in the interval $[-200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}, +200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}]$ is blocked from reaching the detector.\n    - Let's check the position of the Stokes line: $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = +120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Since $-200  120  +200$, the Stokes line falls within the filter's rejection band.

Both bands are $B_g$.", "solution": "The solution proceeds by applying fundamental principles of Raman spectroscopy and group theory to the provided experimental data.\n\n**1. Raman Activity and the Mutual Exclusion Rule**\n\nThe molecule is stated to belong to the $C_{2h}$ point group, which includes a center of inversion symmetry element, $i$. Such molecules are termed centrosymmetric. For centrosymmetric molecules, the mutual exclusion rule applies: vibrational modes that are Raman active are infrared (IR) inactive, and vice-versa.\n\nIn group theory, Raman activity is associated with normal modes that transform as one of the quadratic functions ($x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz$). These functions are symmetric with respect to inversion and are thus assigned a 'g' (from German *gerade*, meaning even) subscript. IR activity is associated with normal modes that transform as one of the Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). These coordinates are antisymmetric with respect to inversion and are assigned a 'u' (from German *ungerade*, meaning odd) subscript.\n\nThe character table for the $C_{2h}$ point group confirms this:\n| $C_{2h}$ | $E$ | $C_2(z)$ | $i$ | $\\sigma_h(xy)$ | Linear, Rotations | Quadratic |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $A_g$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $R_z$ | $x^2, y^2, z^2, xy$ |\n| $B_g$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $R_x, R_y$ | $xz, yz$ |\n| $A_u$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $z$ | |\n| $B_u$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $x, y$ | |\n\nFrom the 'Quadratic' column, the Raman active irreducible representations are $A_g$ and $B_g$. Vibrations with $A_u$ or $B_u$ symmetry are Raman inactive. Since two Raman bands are observed at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, the corresponding vibrations must have either $A_g$ or $B_g$ symmetry. This immediately rules out options C and D.\n\n**2. Depolarization Ratio and Symmetry**\n\nFor an isotropic sample (liquid solution) under nonresonant conditions with linearly polarized incident light, the depolarization ratio, $\\rho = I_{\\perp} / I_{\\parallel}$, provides information about the symmetry of the vibration.\n\n-   **Totally Symmetric Vibrations:** For a vibration to be totally symmetric, its character under all symmetry operations of the group is $+1$. In the $C_{2h}$ point group, this corresponds to the $A_g$ irreducible representation. For such vibrations, the depolarization ratio is in the range $0 \\le \\rho  3/4$. A Raman band with $\\rho  0.75$ is called a **polarized** band.\n\n-   **Non-Totally Symmetric Vibrations:** For any non-totally symmetric Raman-active vibration, the depolarization ratio has a fixed theoretical value of $\\rho = 3/4 = 0.75$. In the $C_{2h}$ group, $B_g$ modes are Raman active but not totally symmetric. A Raman band with $\\rho = 0.75$ is called a **depolarized** band.\n\n**3. Assignment of Symmetries based on Experimental Data**\n\nWe can now assign symmetries to the observed bands by comparing their measured depolarization ratios to these theoretical values.\n\n-   **Band at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:** The measured depolarization ratio is $\\rho_{1000} = 0.15$. Since $0.15  0.75$, this is a polarized band. This indicates that the vibration is totally symmetric. Therefore, the vibration at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ must have $A_g$ symmetry.\n\n-   **Band at $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:** The measured depolarization ratio is $\\rho_{1200} = 0.85$. This value is very close to the theoretical value of $0.75$ for a depolarized band. The problem states that the \"optical setup has not been polarization-calibrated,\" which commonly leads to experimental values slightly deviating from the theoretical limits. A measured value of $0.85$ is thus entirely consistent with a depolarized band, especially when the alternative is a polarized band for which $\\rho$ must be strictly less than $0.75$. Therefore, it is most plausible to assign the vibration at $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ as a non-totally symmetric Raman active mode, which corresponds to $B_g$ symmetry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe vibration at $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is of $A_g$ symmetry.\nThe vibration at $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is of $B_g$ symmetry.\nThis matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3720810"}]}
