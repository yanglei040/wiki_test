The derivation will be based on the fundamental principles of electromagnetic wave propagation at a dielectric interface.\n\nLet us consider a planar interface in the $z=0$ plane, separating two non-magnetic, isotropic dielectric media. Medium $1$ (for $z<0$) is the Internal Reflection Element (IRE) with refractive index $n_1$. Medium $2$ (for $z>0$) is the organic sample with refractive index $n_2$. An electromagnetic plane wave in medium $1$ is incident on the interface. The electric field vectors for the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves can be written as:\n$$ \\vec{E}_i(\\vec{r}, t) = \\vec{E}_{0i} \\exp(i(\\vec{k}_i \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega t)) $$\n$$ \\vec{E}_r(\\vec{r}, t) = \\vec{E}_{0r} \\exp(i(\\vec{k}_r \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega t)) $$\n$$ \\vec{E}_t(\\vec{r}, t) = \\vec{E}_{0t} \\exp(i(\\vec{k}_t \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega t)) $$\nwhere $\\vec{k}_i$, $\\vec{k}_r$, and $\\vec{k}_t$ are the wavevectors for the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves, respectively. The angular frequency $\\omega$ is the same for all three waves. The magnitudes of the wavevectors are given by $k_i = k_r = k_1 = \\frac{n_1 \\omega}{c}$ and $k_t = k_2 = \\frac{n_2 \\omega}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nAccording to the electromagnetic boundary conditions, the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields must be continuous across the interface at $z=0$ for all points on the interface and for all time $t$. For this to hold, the phase factors of all waves must be equal at the boundary.\n$$ (\\vec{k}_i \\cdot \\vec{r})|_{z=0} = (\\vec{k}_r \\cdot \\vec{r})|_{z=0} = (\\vec{k}_t \\cdot \\vec{r})|_{z=0} $$\nLet the plane of incidence be the $x-z$ plane. The wavevectors can be written in terms of their components. Let $\\theta$ be the angle of incidence in medium $1$ and $\\theta_t$ be the angle of refraction in medium $2$, both measured with respect to the normal (the $z$-axis).\n$$ \\vec{k}_i = k_1 (\\sin\\theta \\hat{x} + \\cos\\theta \\hat{z}) $$\n$$ \\vec{k}_t = k_2 (\\sin\\theta_t \\hat{x} + \\cos\\theta_t \\hat{z}) $$\nThe position vector on the interface is $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y}$. The phase-matching condition becomes:\n$$ k_{ix}x + k_{iy}y = k_{tx}x + k_{ty}y $$\nAs we chose the incidence plane to be the $x-z$ plane, $k_{iy} = k_{ty} = 0$. The condition simplifies to $k_{ix}x = k_{tx}x$, which implies $k_{ix} = k_{tx}$. This is the law of conservation of the tangential component of the wavevector.\nSubstituting the components:\n$$ k_1 \\sin\\theta = k_2 \\sin\\theta_t $$\nUsing the expressions for the wavevector magnitudes:\n$$ \\frac{n_1 \\omega}{c} \\sin\\theta = \\frac{n_2 \\omega}{c} \\sin\\theta_t $$\nThis simplifies to Snell's law of refraction:\n$$ n_1 \\sin\\theta = n_2 \\sin\\theta_t $$\nTotal Internal Reflection (TIR) is the phenomenon where no energy is transmitted into the second medium as a propagating wave. This onset condition occurs when the angle of refraction $\\theta_t$ reaches its maximum possible value for a real angle, which is $\\theta_t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians ($90^\\circ$). At this point, the refracted ray would skim parallel to the interface. The specific angle of incidence $\\theta$ for which this occurs is defined as the critical angle, $\\theta_c$.\nBy substituting $\\theta = \\theta_c$ and $\\theta_t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ into Snell's law:\n$$ n_1 \\sin\\theta_c = n_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\nSince $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1$, we obtain the condition for the critical angle:\n$$ n_1 \\sin\\theta_c = n_2 $$\nSolving for $\\theta_c$ gives the analytic expression:\n$$ \\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right) $$\nFor a real solution for $\\theta_c$ to exist, the argument of the arcsin function must be less than or equal to $1$, so $\\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\le 1$, which implies $n_1 \\ge n_2$. This confirms that TIR can only occur when light travels from a medium of higher refractive index to a medium of lower refractive index.\n\nNow we evaluate $\\theta_c$ for the given values: $n_1 = 2.4$ (diamond IRE) and $n_2 = 1.5$ (organic sample).\n$$ \\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1.5}{2.4}\\right) = \\arcsin(0.625) $$\nCalculating the value in degrees:\n$$ \\theta_c \\approx 38.682187...^\\circ $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\theta_c = 38.68^\\circ$.\n\nNext, we discuss the experimental consequences if the chosen internal incidence angle satisfies $\\theta < \\theta_c$. We analyze this from first principles using the wavevector decomposition. The $z$-component of the transmitted wavevector, $k_{tz}$, is given by the dispersion relation in medium $2$: $k_{tx}^2 + k_{tz}^2 = k_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{n_2 \\omega}{c}\\right)^2$.\nFrom the boundary condition, we know $k_{tx} = k_{ix} = k_1 \\sin\\theta = \\frac{n_1 \\omega}{c} \\sin\\theta$.\nSubstituting this into the dispersion relation and solving for $k_{tz}$:\n$$ k_{tz}^2 = \\left(\\frac{n_2 \\omega}{c}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{n_1 \\omega}{c} \\sin\\theta\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\right)^2 (n_2^2 - n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta) $$\n$$ k_{tz} = \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\sqrt{n_2^2 - n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta} $$\nWhen $\\theta < \\theta_c$, we have $\\sin\\theta < \\sin\\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$. This implies $n_1 \\sin\\theta < n_2$, so $n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta < n_2^2$. Consequently, the term inside the square root, $(n_2^2 - n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta)$, is positive. This means that $k_{tz}$ is a real and positive value.\nThe electric field in the sample ($z>0$) is proportional to $\\exp(i(k_{tx}x + k_{tz}z - \\omega t))$. Since both $k_{tx}$ and $k_{tz}$ are real, this expression describes a plane wave that propagates away from the interface into the bulk of the sample. This is conventional refraction.\n\nIn this scenario ($\\theta < \\theta_c$):\n1.  **Evanescent Field:** An evanescent field is **not** established. An evanescent field arises only when $k_{tz}$ is purely imaginary, which occurs when $\\theta > \\theta_c$. In that case, the term inside the square root is negative, leading to $k_{tz}=i\\alpha$ where $\\alpha = \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\sqrt{n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta - n_2^2}$. The field amplitude in the sample would then decay exponentially with depth $z$ as $\\exp(-\\alpha z)$, confining the field interaction to the surface. For $\\theta < \\theta_c$, the field propagates, it does not evanesce.\n\n2.  **Spectral Acquisition and Interpretation:** The ATR-IR technique is predicated on the interaction of the sample with the evanescent field. The sample absorbs energy from the evanescent field at its characteristic vibrational frequencies. This absorption slightly reduces the intensity of the totally internally reflected light. By measuring the reflected intensity as a function of wavelength, one obtains the absorption spectrum of the sample's surface layer.\nIf $\\theta < \\theta_c$, the fundamental condition for ATR is violated. Instead of total internal reflection, there is partial reflection and significant transmission (refraction) of the IR beam into the sample. A large fraction of the incident energy is lost into the bulk of the sample and does not return to the detector. The resulting signal would not be an ATR spectrum. It would be a spectrum corresponding to an external reflection/transmission measurement, dominated by bulk properties and large-scale energy loss, not the subtle surface-sensitive absorptions that ATR is designed to measure. Therefore, a valid ATR-IR spectrum cannot be acquired or interpreted under the condition $\\theta < \\theta_c$. The experiment would fail to produce the desired data.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{38.68}\n$$", "id": "3693825"}, {"introduction": "With the condition for total internal reflection met, an evanescent wave is created that probes the sample near the interface.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetic wave propagation and total internal reflection, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the penetration depth $d_p$ of an evanescent field and then calculate its value for the given parameters. The derivation starts from fundamental principles. Let the interface between the internal reflection element (IRE, medium $1$) and the sample (medium $2$) be the $z=0$ plane. The IRE occupies the $z<0$ region, and the sample occupies the $z>0$ region. Let the plane of incidence be the $xz$-plane.\n\nA monochromatic plane wave propagates in medium $1$ with wavevector $\\vec{k}_1$.
