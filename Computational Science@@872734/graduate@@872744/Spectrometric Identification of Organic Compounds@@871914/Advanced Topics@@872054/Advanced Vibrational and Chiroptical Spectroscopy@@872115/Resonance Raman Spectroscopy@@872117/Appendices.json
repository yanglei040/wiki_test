I will proceed with the detailed derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe intensity of a Raman band in a resonance Raman experiment is governed by the properties of the electronic transition being excited. The problem involves two primary enhancement mechanisms, described by the Albrecht $A$ and $B$ terms.\n\n1.  **Albrecht A-term (Franck-Condon Scattering):** This term provides enhancement for totally symmetric vibrational modes ($a_{1g}$ in $D_{6h}$). Its intensity is proportional to the square of the electronic transition dipole moment at the equilibrium geometry, $(\\mu^{(0)})^2$. The problem states that the $\\,^{1}A_{1g} \\to \\,^{1}B_{2u}$ transition is symmetry-forbidden. Let us verify this using group theory.\n\n    A transition is allowed if the transition moment integral, $\\langle \\Psi_g | \\hat{\\mu} | \\Psi_e \\rangle$, is non-zero. For this to occur, the direct product of the symmetries of the components must contain the totally symmetric representation ($A_{1g}$ for $D_{6h}$).\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(\\Psi_g) \\times \\Gamma(\\hat{\\mu}) \\times \\Gamma(\\Psi_e) \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given symmetries:\n    $$\n    A_{1g} \\times E_{1u} \\times B_{2u}\n    $$\n    Since $A_{1g}$ is the identity representation, we need to compute the direct product $E_{1u} \\times B_{2u}$. Using the character table for the $D_{6h}$ point group:\n    $$\n    E_{1u} \\times B_{2u} = E_{2g}\n    $$\n    The full direct product is thus:\n    $$\n    A_{1g} \\times E_{2g} = E_{2g}\n    $$\n    Since $E_{2g}$ is not $A_{1g}$, the direct product does not contain the totally symmetric representation. The transition is indeed symmetry-forbidden, so $\\mu^{(0)}=0$. Consequently, the Albrecht $A$-term is zero, and there will be no significant Franck-Condon enhancement for totally symmetric ($a_{1g}$) modes.\n\n2.  **Albrecht B-term (Herzberg-Teller Scattering):** This mechanism becomes dominant when the electronic transition is symmetry-forbidden or weak. It describes how a non-totally symmetric vibration, known as a promoting mode ($Q_p$), can \"lend\" or \"borrow\" intensity from a nearby strongly allowed electronic transition.\n\n    The promoting mode $Q_p$ couples the target excited state $\\Psi_e$ (of symmetry $\\Gamma_e = B_{2u}$) with another electronic state $\\Psi_s$ (of symmetry $\\Gamma_s$) for which the transition from the ground state is strongly allowed.\n\n    First, let's determine the symmetry $\\Gamma_s$ of the state $\\Psi_s$ from which intensity can be borrowed. The transition $\\Psi_g \\to \\Psi_s$ must be allowed:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(\\Psi_g) \\times \\Gamma(\\hat{\\mu}) \\times \\Gamma_s \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    $$\n    A_{1g} \\times E_{1u} \\times \\Gamma_s \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    This requires that $E_{1u} \\times \\Gamma_s$ contains $A_{1g}$. In a point group with an inversion center, this is only possible if $\\Gamma_s = E_{1u}$. The state from which intensity is borrowed must have $E_{1u}$ symmetry. (This corresponds to the strongly allowed $\\,^{1}E_{1u} \\leftarrow \\,^{1}A_{1g}$ Soret band in benzene).\n\n    Second, let's find the symmetry of the promoting mode, $\\Gamma(Q_p)$, that couples $\\Psi_e$ and $\\Psi_s$. The vibronic coupling operator has the symmetry of the vibrational normal coordinate, $\\Gamma(Q_p)$. The coupling integral $\\langle \\Psi_e | \\hat{H}_{vib} | \\Psi_s \\rangle$ must be non-zero, meaning the direct product of the symmetries must contain $A_{1g}$:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(\\Psi_e) \\times \\Gamma(Q_p) \\times \\Gamma_s \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    Substituting the known symmetries:\n    $$\n    B_{2u} \\times \\Gamma(Q_p) \\times E_{1u} \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    For this to be true, $\\Gamma(Q_p)$ must have the same symmetry as the direct product $B_{2u} \\times E_{1u}$. As calculated before:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(Q_p) = B_{2u} \\times E_{1u} = E_{2g}\n    $$\n    Therefore, the promoting modes must have $e_{2g}$ symmetry. These are the vibrations that make the forbidden electronic transition vibronically allowed.\n\n    According to the problem statement and the principles of RR spectroscopy, the Albrecht $B$-term strongly enhances scattering via the promoting modes. Thus, the fundamentals of the $e_{2g}$ vibrational modes are expected to be the most strongly enhanced features in the RR spectrum.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Only $a_{1g}$ fundamentals are strongly enhanced; non-totally symmetric modes remain weak.**\n    This describes Albrecht A-term enhancement. As shown above, the A-term is zero because the electronic transition is forbidden ($\\mu^{(0)}=0$). Therefore, $a_{1g}$ modes are not expected to be strongly enhanced via the Franck-Condon mechanism. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. $e_{2g}$ fundamentals are strongly enhanced via vibronic coupling; $a_{1g}$ fundamentals are weak or absent under direct resonance with the $\\,^{1}B_{2u}$ band.**\n    My derivation showed that modes of $e_{2g}$ symmetry act as promoting modes for the $\\,^{1}B_{2u} \\leftarrow \\,^{1}A_{1g}$ transition. Herzberg-Teller theory (Albrecht B-term) predicts strong enhancement for these promoting modes in RR. The statement that $a_{1g}$ fundamentals are weak or absent is also correct, as their primary enhancement mechanism (A-term) is switched off. This option accurately describes the expected spectroscopic outcome. This option is **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. $e_{1g}$ and $b_{1g}$ modes are enhanced because $E_{1u}$ couples $\\,^{1}A_{1g}$ to $\\,^{1}B_{2u}$ through $e_{1g}$ symmetry.**\n    The reasoning in this option is confused. The operator $\\hat{\\mu}$ with symmetry $E_{1u}$ mediates the transition but doesn't \"couple\" states in the sense of vibronic coupling. We can test if an $e_{1g}$ mode could be a promoting mode. The coupled state would have symmetry $B_{2u} \\times E_{1g} = E_{2u}$. A transition from $A_{1g}$ to $E_{2u}$ is forbidden, as $A_{1g} \\times E_{1u} \\times E_{2u}$ does not contain $A_{1g}$. If a $b_{1g}$ mode were promoting, the coupled state would have symmetry $B_{2u} \\times B_{1g} = A_{2u}$. A transition to an $A_{2u}$ state is allowed, but via the $z$-polarized dipole component ($A_{2u}$), not the $xy$-component ($E_{1u}$) specified in the problem. The core logic of the problem requires coupling to an $E_{1u}$ state, which necessitates an $e_{2g}$ promoter. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. $b_{2u}$ modes are enhanced because the excited electronic state is $\\,^{1}B_{2u}$.**\n    This suggests a simplistic and incorrect correlation between the symmetry of the electronic state and the enhanced vibration. A group-theoretical analysis is required. If a $b_{2u}$ mode were the promoter, it would couple the $B_{2u}$ state to a state with symmetry $B_{2u} \\times B_{2u} = A_{1g}$. This is the ground state itself, so this coupling does not lead to borrowing intensity from an allowed excited-state transition.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Physical Explanation of Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman Scattering\n\nRaman scattering is an inelastic light scattering process.\n**Stokes Raman scattering** originates from molecules in their ground vibrational state (let's denote it as $v=0$). An incident photon of energy $h c \\tilde{\\nu}_L$ excites the molecule to a short-lived virtual state. The molecule then relaxes to a higher vibrational level (e.g., $v=1$) of the electronic ground state, emitting a scattered photon. To conserve energy, the scattered photon has a lower energy $h c \\tilde{\\nu}_S = h c (\\tilde{\\nu}_L - \\tilde{\\nu}_v)$, where $h c \\tilde{\\nu}_v$ is the energy of the vibrational quantum gained by the molecule. The scattered light is shifted to a lower frequency (longer wavelength) relative to the incident light.\n\n**Anti-Stokes Raman scattering** originates from molecules that are already in an excited vibrational state (e.g., $v=1$). An incident photon of energy $h c \\tilde{\\nu}_L$ excites the molecule to a virtual state. The molecule then relaxes to a lower vibrational level (e.g., $v=0$), transferring its initial vibrational energy to the scattered photon. The scattered photon therefore has a higher energy $h c \\tilde{\\nu}_{AS} = h c (\\tilde{\\nu}_L + \\tilde{\\nu}_v)$. The scattered light is shifted to a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) relative to the incident light.\n\nAt thermal equilibrium, the population of the ground vibrational state ($n_0$) is significantly higher than that of any excited vibrational state ($n_1, n_2, \\dots$), as described by the Boltzmann distribution. Consequently, Stokes scattering is almost always more intense than anti-Stokes scattering in non-resonant Raman spectroscopy.\n\n#### Estimation of the Intensity Ratio $I_{AS}/I_{S}$\n\nThe intensity of a Raman line is proportional to the population of the initial state ($n_{init}$), the fourth power of the scattered light's wavenumber ($\\tilde{\\nu}_s^4$), and the squared magnitude of the Raman scattering amplitude ($|R|^2$). The ratio of anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity is given by:\n$$ \\frac{I_{AS}}{I_S} = \\frac{n_1}{n_0} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{AS}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_S}\\right)^4 \\cdot \\frac{|R_{AS}|^2}{|R_S|^2} $$\nWe will evaluate each of these three factors using the provided data.\n\n**1. Population Ratio (Boltzmann Factor):**\nThe ratio of the population of the first excited vibrational state ($n_1$) to the ground vibrational state ($n_0$) is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$ \\frac{n_1}{n_0} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1 - E_0}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}_v}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nFirst, we calculate the thermal energy in units of wavenumbers at $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ \\frac{k_B T}{hc} = \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s})(2.9979 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s})} \\approx 207.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nWith the vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_v = 200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:\n$$ \\frac{n_1}{n_0} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{207.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-0.9657) \\approx 0.3807 $$\n\n**2. Scattered Frequency Factor:**\nFirst, we find the wavenumbers of the scattered light for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_S = \\tilde{\\nu}_L - \\tilde{\\nu}_v = 19850\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 19650\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{AS} = \\tilde{\\nu}_L + \\tilde{\\nu}_v = 19850\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} + 200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 20050\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nThe ratio of the frequency factors is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{AS}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_S}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{20050\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{19650\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\\right)^4 \\approx (1.020356)^4 \\approx 1.084 $$\n\n**3. Resonance Enhancement Factor:**\nAccording to the KHD formalism in the resonance limit specified, the Raman intensity is enhanced when either the incoming laser frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu}_L$) or the scattered frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu}_S$ or $\\tilde{\\nu}_{AS}$) is close to an electronic transition frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu}_e$). The amplitude $R$ is inversely proportional to the detuning terms. Assuming the dominant contribution to the intensity comes from a denominator product of the incoming and outgoing resonance terms, the intensity $|R|^2$ is proportional to $1 / (|D_{in}|^2 |D_{out}|^2)$.\nFor Stokes scattering: $I_S \\propto 1 / (|(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_L) - i\\Gamma|^2 \\cdot |(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_S) - i\\Gamma|^2)$.\nFor anti-Stokes scattering: $I_{AS} \\propto 1 / (|(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_L) - i\\Gamma |^2 \\cdot |(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_{AS}) - i\\Gamma|^2)$.\nThe problem assumes identical vibronic coupling factors, meaning the numerators of the amplitude expressions are the same. The incoming resonance term, involving $(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_L)$, is common to both and cancels in the ratio. The ratio of the squared amplitudes is thus determined by the outgoing resonance terms:\n$$ \\frac{|R_{AS}|^2}{|R_S|^2} = \\frac{|(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_S) - i\\Gamma|^2}{|(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_{AS}) - i\\Gamma|^2} = \\frac{(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_S)^2 + \\Gamma^2}{(\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_{AS})^2 + \\Gamma^2} $$\nLet's calculate the detunings for the scattered light:\n$$ \\Delta_{S, out} = \\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_S = 20000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 19650\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 350\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta_{AS, out} = \\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_{AS} = 20000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 20050\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = -50\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nUsing $\\Gamma = 100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:\n$$ \\frac{|R_{AS}|^2}{|R_S|^2} = \\frac{(350\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})^2 + (100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})^2}{(-50\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})^2 + (100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})^2} = \\frac{122500 + 10000}{2500 + 10000} = \\frac{132500}{12500} = 10.6 $$\nThe anti-Stokes scattering process experiences a much larger resonance enhancement because its scattered frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}_{AS}$ lies significantly closer to the electronic resonance $\\tilde{\\nu}_e$ than the Stokes scattered frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}_S$.\n\n**Final Ratio Calculation:**\nWe combine the three factors:\n$$ \\frac{I_{AS}}{I_S} \\approx (0.3807) \\cdot (1.084) \\cdot (10.6) \\approx 4.37 $$\nThe calculation shows that for this specific scenario, the anti-Stokes line intensity is expected to be approximately $4.4$ times greater than the Stokes line intensity. This powerful enhancement, which overcomes the population disadvantage, is a hallmark of resonance Raman spectroscopy.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. For low-frequency modes at ambient temperature, if the laser is tuned such that the anti-Stokes scattered wavenumber lies closer to the electronic transition (outgoing resonance) than the Stokes scattered wavenumber, the anti-Stokes intensity can approach or exceed the Stokes intensity.**\nThis statement accurately describes the conditions calculated above.\n- \"low-frequency modes at ambient temperature\": Our mode is $\\tilde{\\nu}_v = 200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ at $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This gives a non-negligible Boltzmann factor of about $0.38$.\n- \"laser is tuned such that the anti-Stokes scattered wavenumber lies closer to the electronic transition\": Our a-S detuning is $|\\Delta_{AS, out}| = 50\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ while the Stokes detuning is $|\\Delta_{S, out}| = 350\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This condition is met.\n- \"anti-Stokes intensity can approach or exceed the Stokes intensity\": Our calculation shows $I_{AS}/I_S \\approx 4.4$, which confirms this conclusion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Even far off-resonance, the anti-Stokes intensity becomes comparable to Stokes solely because the scattered anti-Stokes frequency is higher, and the $\\tilde{\\nu}_s^4$ factor dominates over population effects.**\nFar off-resonance, the resonance enhancement factor $|R_{AS}|^2/|R_S|^2$ approaches $1$. The intensity ratio is then approximately $\\frac{I_{AS}}{I_S} \\approx \\frac{n_1}{n_0} \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{AS}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_S}\\right)^4$. Using our numerical example, this would be $0.3807 \\times 1.084 \\approx 0.41$. The anti-Stokes intensity is less than half of the Stokes intensity, not \"comparable\". The $\\tilde{\\nu}_s^4$ factor ($1.084$) is a minor correction and by no means \"dominates\" the population factor ($0.3807$). For higher frequency vibrations (e.g., $1600\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$), the population factor becomes exponentially smaller, while the frequency factor remains close to $1$. The statement is physically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. At cryogenic temperatures, incoming resonance alone (laser tuned near $\\tilde{\\nu}_e$) suffices to make anti-Stokes intensities comparable to Stokes for typical high-frequency modes, because resonance dominates over initial-state populations.**\nLet's consider cryogenic temperature, e.g., $T=77\\,\\mathrm{K}$, where $k_B T / (hc) \\approx 54\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. For a \"high-frequency mode\", e.g., $\\tilde{\\nu}_v = 1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, the population factor is $\\exp(-1500/54) \\approx 10^{-12}$, an extremely small number. \"Incoming resonance alone\" means $\\tilde{\\nu}_L \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_e$. In this case, the detunings for the scattered photons are $\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_S \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_v$ and $\\tilde{\\nu}_e - \\tilde{\\nu}_{AS} \\approx -\\tilde{\\nu}_v$. The resonance enhancement factor ratio $|R_{AS}|^2/|R_S|^2$ would be $\\frac{(\\tilde{\\nu}_v)^2 + \\Gamma^2}{(-\\tilde{\\nu}_v)^2 + \\Gamma^2} = 1$. There is no preferential enhancement for the anti-Stokes line. The intensity ratio would be governed by the minuscule population factor. Resonance does not dominate the population effect in this scenario.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under resonance conditions, if non-Boltzmann vibrational populations are created (for example, by vibrational pre-excitation or laser-induced vibrational pumping), anti-Stokes intensities can become comparable to Stokes even for higher-frequency modes that would otherwise be anti-Stokes suppressed at room temperature.**\nThe primary reason for weak anti-Stokes signals is the small population of the initial excited vibrational state ($n_1$). If this population can be increased by external means (a non-thermal, non-Boltzmann distribution), for instance by using an infrared laser to pump molecules from $v=0$ to $v=1$, then the ratio $n_1/n_0$ can be made to approach or even exceed unity. This would directly boost the anti-Stokes signal, making it comparable to the Stokes signal, even for high-frequency modes where thermal population is negligible. This is a sound physical principle and the basis for advanced techniques like Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS), where populations are manipulated.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Choosing a detection scheme that favors longer wavelengths increases anti-Stokes intensities relative to Stokes due to instrumental factors, making them comparable regardless of resonance or temperature.**\nThis statement is factually flawed. Anti-Stokes lines have a higher frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu}_{AS} > \\tilde{\\nu}_L$) and therefore a *shorter* wavelength ($\\lambda_{AS} < \\lambda_L$) than the incident light. Stokes lines have a lower frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu}_S < \\tilde{\\nu}_L$) and a *longer* wavelength ($\\lambda_S > \\lambda_L$). Therefore, a detection scheme favoring *longer* wavelengths would enhance the measured Stokes signal relative to the anti-Stokes signal, not the other way around. The premise is incorrect. Furthermore, instrumental response, while important for quantitative analysis, cannot make intensities comparable \"regardless of resonance or temperature\", as these physical factors determine the intrinsic scattering cross-sections by orders of magnitude.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3721602"}]}
