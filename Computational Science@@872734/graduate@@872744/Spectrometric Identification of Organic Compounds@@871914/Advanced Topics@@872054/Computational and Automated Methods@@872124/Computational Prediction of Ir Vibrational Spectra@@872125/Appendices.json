Under the $D_{2h}$ approximation, the two bending motions split into two distinct, nondegenerate modes, each lying in a different plane containing the molecular axis.\n\nWe align the molecular axis with the $z$-axis, so the antisymmetric stretch involves out-of-phase displacement of the terminal oxygens and carbon along $z$, producing a change in the dipole moment component along $z$. In $D_{2h}$, the translation components transform as\n$$\nx \\sim B_{3u}, \\quad y \\sim B_{2u}, \\quad z \\sim B_{1u}.\n$$\nTherefore, a normal coordinate that produces a dipole change along $z$ transforms as $B_{1u}$, and is IR-active.

One bending motion yields a change along $x$, transforming as $B_{3u}$, and the other yields a change along $y$, transforming as $B_{2u}$. Both $B_{3u}$ and $B_{2u}$ are ungerade irreducible representations that match polar vector components, hence both bending modes are IR-active.

It addresses a core conceptual point in computational spectroscopy.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet the potential energy of a molecule with $N$ atoms be a function of the $3N$ Cartesian nuclear coordinates, $\\mathbf{q} = \\{q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_{3N}\\}$. This function $V(\\mathbf{q})$ is the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES).\n\nThe harmonic approximation for vibrations is based on a Taylor series expansion of $V(\\mathbf{q})$ around a reference geometry $\\mathbf{q}_0$. Let $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{q}_0$ be the vector of Cartesian displacements from this reference point. The expansion to second order is:\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{q}_0 + \\mathbf{x}) \\approx V(\\mathbf{q}_0) + \\sum_{i=1}^{3N} \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q_i} \\right)_{\\mathbf{q}_0} x_i + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{3N} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial q_i \\partial q_j} \\right)_{\\mathbf{q}_0} x_i x_j\n$$\nThis can be written in matrix notation. Let $V_0 = V(\\mathbf{q}_0)$, let $\\mathbf{g}$ be the gradient vector with components $g_i = (\\partial V / \\partial q_i)_{\\mathbf{q}_0}$, and let $\\mathbf{H}$ be the Hessian matrix with elements $H_{ij} = (\\partial^2 V / \\partial q_i \\partial q_j)_{\\mathbf{q}_0}$. The potential is then:\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx V_0 + \\mathbf{g}^T \\mathbf{x} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{x}\n$$\nThe force on the nuclei is given by $\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla V$. Using the approximate potential, the force is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx -\\mathbf{g} - \\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{x}\n$$\nThe standard normal-mode analysis, which is used to compute vibrational frequencies, is predicated on the assumption that the expansion point $\\mathbf{q}_0$ is a stationary point, specifically a minimum, on the PES. At a stationary point, the gradient is zero by definition: $\\mathbf{g} = \\mathbf{0}$. Under this critical assumption, the linear term in the potential vanishes, and the force becomes purely \"harmonic\": $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{x}$. This describes a system of coupled oscillators where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement. The dynamics of this system lead to the secular equation involving the mass-weighted Hessian, whose eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ are related to the squared vibrational frequencies $\\omega_k^2$.\n\nThe problem states that the analysis is performed at a geometry where the gradient norm is non-zero, i.e., $\\mathbf{g} \\ne \\mathbf{0}$. This violates the fundamental assumption of the harmonic model for vibrations. The presence of the linear term $\\mathbf{g}^T \\mathbf{x}$ in the potential means the reference point $\\mathbf{q}_0$ is on a \"slope\" of the PES. The force term $-\\mathbf{g}$ represents a constant, non-zero force acting on all atoms, trying to pull the entire molecule \"downhill\" towards a lower-energy structure.\n\nWhen a standard vibrational analysis program is run, it proceeds to construct and diagonalize the mass-weighted Hessian, $\\mathbf{H}' = \\mathbf{M}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}$, regardless of the gradient. However, the physical meaning of the resulting eigenvalues is lost. The eigenvalues no longer correspond to pure vibrations around a stable equilibrium.\n\nSpecifically, the effect of the non-zero gradient is as follows:\n1.  **Imaginary Frequency:** The gradient vector $\\mathbf{g}$ points \"uphill\" on the PES. The direction of steepest descent is $-\\mathbf{g}$. Motion along this direction leads to a decrease in energy. The curvature of the PES along this direction is often negative. A negative curvature corresponds to a negative eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix. Since frequency $\\omega$ is related to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ by $\\omega \\propto \\sqrt{\\lambda}$, a negative $\\lambda$ results in an imaginary frequency. This explains the \"one small imaginary frequency\" reported in the problem; it corresponds to the system trying to relax along the gradient to a true minimum.\n2.  **Spurious Low Frequencies:** At a true equilibrium geometry, the PES is invariant with respect to infinitesimal rigid translations and rotations of the molecule. This invariance mathematically guarantees that the Hessian has $5$ or $6$ exactly zero eigenvalues. The corresponding \"modes\" are not vibrations. When $\\mathbf{g} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, the system is no longer in a force-free state, and this invariance is broken from the perspective of the harmonic model. The gradient vector defines a special direction in space. Consequently, the translational and rotational degrees of freedom couple with the vibrational modes and are no longer associated with zero-frequency eigenvalues. They typically appear as several small, non-zero frequencies (\"unexpectedly low frequencies\"), contaminating the low-frequency region of the spectrum ($< 100 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$).\n\nThe only physically and mathematically sound corrective action is to eliminate the source of the error: the non-zero gradient. This is achieved by performing a **geometry optimization**. An optimization algorithm iteratively updates the geometry $\\mathbf{q}$ to minimize the energy $V(\\mathbf{q})$ until the gradient norm $\\|\\mathbf{g}\\|$ falls below a pre-defined, tight convergence threshold. Once this true stationary point (a local minimum) is located, the harmonic analysis must be redone. This involves recomputing the Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ at this new, correct geometry, as the Hessian elements are themselves functions of the geometry. The eigenvalues of this new Hessian will then yield the physically meaningful harmonic vibrational frequencies.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A non-zero gradient introduces a linear term in the local expansion of the potential that invalidates the stationary-point assumptions used in normal-mode analysis, leading to spurious imaginary or shifted low frequencies, especially for soft modes and would-be translational/rotational motions. The robust correction is to reoptimize the nuclear geometry until the gradient norm is below a tight threshold and then recompute the Hessian and IR properties at that stationary point.**\nThis option is a precise and complete description of the situation. It correctly identifies the mathematical origin (the linear term $\\mathbf{g}^T \\mathbf{x}$), the physical consequence (spurious imaginary and low-frequency modes from translational/rotational contamination), and the standard, robust corrective procedure (geometry optimization followed by a new Hessian calculation).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A non-zero gradient affects only IR intensities via dipole moment derivatives but leaves harmonic frequencies unchanged to leading order; the proper fix is to recompute only the dipole derivatives at the same geometry.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The non-zero gradient corrupts the potential for the nuclear motion, which directly determines the frequencies. The frequencies are profoundly affected, as evidenced by the appearance of an imaginary frequency. IR intensities are also incorrect, but this is a secondary consequence. The proposed fix is entirely inadequate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A non-zero gradient causes a uniform upward shift of all harmonic frequencies proportional to the gradient norm; the fix is to subtract a constant from the diagonal of the Hessian equal to that proportionality.**\nThis is incorrect. The effect is not a uniform shift; it is highly directional, primarily affecting modes that have a component along the gradient. Furthermore, the primary artifact is an imaginary frequency, which represents a large *downward* shift of a squared frequency to a negative value, not an upward shift. The proposed fix is an ad-hoc and baseless numerical manipulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The effects of a non-zero gradient on harmonic frequencies can be exactly removed by projecting the gradient vector out of the mass-weighted Hessian without changing the geometry; the resulting projected frequencies reproduce those at the true stationary point.**\nThis is incorrect. First, the idea of \"projecting a vector out of a matrix\" is not a standard, well-defined procedure for this purpose. While projection methods are used to separate rotational/translational modes from vibrations, they cannot fix the underlying issue. Second, and more importantly, this approach attempts a \"fix\" at the incorrect geometry. The Hessian matrix itself is evaluated at a non-stationary point and is thus different from the Hessian at the true minimum. No manipulation of the incorrect Hessian can magically yield the frequencies corresponding to the correct Hessian at the correct geometry.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If finite-difference step sizes used to build the Hessian are chosen smaller than the displacement implied by the gradient, the harmonic frequencies are unaffected by non-stationarity and no reoptimization is required.**\nThis is incorrect. The method used to compute the Hessian (e.g., finite differences) and the step size chosen relate to the *numerical accuracy* of the Hessian calculation at that specific point. It does not address the fundamental *conceptual error* of performing a vibrational analysis at a point that is not a force-free equilibrium. The presence of the linear gradient term invalidates the model, regardless of how accurately the quadratic curvature (the Hessian) is computed at that faulty point.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3697356"}]}
