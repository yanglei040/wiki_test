The key to interpreting HDX-MS data lies in understanding the exchange kinetics.\n\n1.  **EX2 Kinetics**: In the most common regime, a protein's local structure undergoes rapid opening and closing ($k_{\\mathrm{cl}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{int}}$). The observed exchange rate reflects an equilibrium-governed process. Mass spectra show a single isotopic envelope that gradually shifts to higher mass over time as more deuterons are incorporated.\n2.  **EX1 Kinetics**: In this regime, a cooperative unfolding event is rate-limiting ($k_{\\mathrm{cl}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{int}}$). Once the structure opens, all accessible protons exchange with deuterium almost instantaneously. This results in a bimodal mass distribution: one envelope corresponding to the unexchanged (closed) population and another at a significantly higher mass corresponding to the fully exchanged (open) population. Over time, the intensity of the low-mass envelope decreases while the intensity of the high-mass envelope increases, as the population of molecules transitions from the closed to the open-and-exchanged state. The mass positions ($m/z$ values) of the centroids of these two envelopes remain fixed.\n3.  **Static Heterogeneity (Non-interconverting States)**: The protein sample exists as a mixture of two or more stable conformers that do not interconvert on the experimental timescale ($t \\sim 10^0-10^3$ s). Each conformer undergoes deuterium exchange independently, producing its own characteristic isotopic envelope. The resulting mass spectrum is a superposition of these envelopes. A defining feature of this mechanism is that the relative abundance of the conformers is constant. Therefore, the relative integrated intensities (areas) of the corresponding isotopic envelopes remain constant across all labeling time points.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data\nThe problem presents several key pieces of information:\n\n1.  **Bimodal Distribution**: The observation of \"two well-resolved envelopes\" immediately rules out a simple EX2 mechanism for a single, homogeneous conformational state. This points toward either EX1 kinetics or static heterogeneity.\n2.  **Fixed Centroids**: The centroids are observed at fixed mass additions corresponding to $+3$ and $+9$ deuterium atoms. The problem states there is \"no detectable centroid drift over time.\" This observation is crucial.\n    *   In EX1, the centroids of the unexchanged and exchanged populations are, by definition, fixed.\n    *   For non-interconverting states, the fact that the centroids are fixed at all time points (from $10$ s to $1000$ s) implies that for each population, the exchange for a specific number of protons is very fast (complete before the first measurement at $10$ s, a \"burst phase\") and the exchange for all other protons is very slow (no significant change by $1000$ s). The low-uptake state rapidly incorporates $3 D$ and the high-uptake state rapidly incorporates $9 D$. This is a physically plausible scenario.\n3.  **Envelope Intensities Over Time**: This is the decisive piece of evidence. The relative populations of the two states can be calculated from the integrated intensities (areas), given the express assumption that response factors and ionization efficiencies are equal for both.\n\nLet $f_{\\ell}$ be the fraction of the low-uptake population and $f_{h}$ be the fraction of the high-uptake population.\n$$f_{\\ell}(t) = \\frac{A_{\\ell}(t)}{A_{\\ell}(t) + A_{h}(t)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_{h}(t) = \\frac{A_{h}(t)}{A_{\\ell}(t) + A_{h}(t)}$$\n\nWe calculate these fractions at each given time point:\n\n*   **At $t = 10$ s:**\n    Total area $A_{\\mathrm{tot}}(10) = A_{\\ell}(10) + A_{h}(10) = (7.5 \\times 10^5) + (5.0 \\times 10^5) = 12.5 \\times 10^5$.\n    $$f_{\\ell}(10) = \\frac{7.5 \\times 10^5}{12.5 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{7.5}{12.5} = 0.60$$\n    $$f_{h}(10) = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^5}{12.5 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{5.0}{12.5} = 0.40$$\n\n*   **At $t = 100$ s:**\n    Total area $A_{\\mathrm{tot}}(100) = A_{\\ell}(100) + A_{h}(100) = (7.4 \\times 10^5) + (4.9 \\times 10^5) = 12.3 \\times 10^5$.\n    $$f_{\\ell}(100) = \\frac{7.4 \\times 10^5}{12.3 \\times 10^5} \\approx 0.6016$$\n    $$f_{h}(100) = \\frac{4.9 \\times 10^5}{12.3 \\times 10^5} \\approx 0.3984$$\n\n*   **At $t = 1000$ s:**\n    Total area $A_{\\mathrm{tot}}(1000) = A_{\\ell}(1000) + A_{h}(1000) = (7.3 \\times 10^5) + (4.8 \\times 10^5) = 12.1 \\times 10^5$.\n    $$f_{\\ell}(1000) = \\frac{7.3 \\times 10^5}{12.1 \\times 10^5} \\approx 0.6033$$\n    $$f_{h}(1000) = \\frac{4.8 \\times 10^5}{12.1 \\times 10^5} \\approx 0.3967$$\n\nThe experimental data clearly show that the fractional populations of the two states are constant over the entire labeling period, within typical experimental uncertainty. $f_{\\ell}$ is consistently $\\approx 0.60$ and $f_{h}$ is consistently $\\approx 0.40$.\n\nThis constancy of relative populations is the hallmark of static heterogeneity.

This option is fully supported by the data and fundamental principles.\n\n**B. The peptide undergoes global EX1 kinetics (cooperative opening) in which the low-uptake population converts to the high-uptake population over time; the fractions therefore vary with time and cannot be considered constant, so $f_{\\ell} = f_{h} = 0.50$ is the best estimate.**\n*   **Mechanistic Inference**: The statement that the peptide undergoes EX1 kinetics is directly contradicted by the data showing constant fractional populations. In EX1, population would transfer from the low-uptake to the high-uptake envelope over time.\n*   **Quantitative Estimate**: The estimate of $f_{\\ell} = f_{h} = 0.50$ is quantitatively incorrect based on the provided areas.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The bimodality is an artifact of overlapping charge states or isotopic fine structure; the correct fractions are given by the ratio of centroid separations, yielding $f_{\\ell} = 3/12 \\approx 0.25$ and $f_{h} = 9/12 \\approx 0.75$.**\n*   **Mechanistic Inference**: This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states that all signals are for the same charge state, and the envelopes are \"well-resolved,\" which is not characteristic of an artifact like isotopic fine structure overlap.\n*   **Quantitative Estimate**: The method of calculating fractions from the ratio of deuterium uptake ($3$ and $9$) is physically meaningless. Population fractions are determined by signal intensities (particle counts), not by the physical properties (mass) of the detected species.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Two non-interconverting states are present, but unequal instrument response between envelopes makes areas unreliable; the most plausible fractions reverse the apparent areas, with $f_{\\ell} \\approx 0.40$ and $f_{h} \\approx 0.60$.**\n*   **Mechanistic Inference**: The first part, \"Two non-interconverting states are present,\" is correct.\n*   **Quantitative Argument**: The second part contradicts the problem's explicit assumptions: \"response factors for the two observed envelopes can be assumed equal\" and \"ionization efficiency is the same for both populations.\" Without any evidence to the contrary, one must adhere to the stated assumptions. Arbitrarily reversing the fractions is not justified.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The states interconvert on the labeling timescale, but their centroid positions are held fixed by exact cancellation from back-exchange; because of this, the fractions evolve yet appear constant, and the best estimate is a time-dependent $f_{\\ell}(t)$ decreasing from $0.60$ toward $0.40$ and $f_{h}(t)$ increasing correspondingly.**\n*   **Mechanistic Inference**: This option proposes a highly contrived and physically implausible scenario. An \"exact cancellation from back-exchange\" to produce fixed centroids is not a recognized phenomenon. The problem also states that back-exchange is minimized. The statement that \"fractions evolve yet appear constant\" is a logical contradiction.\n*   **Quantitative Estimate**: The claim that fractions are time-dependent is contrary to the provided data.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3707740"}]}
