It provides all necessary physical constants and defines the terms for a standard calculation in the field of mass spectrometry. The compound class (perfluoroalkyl substances) and analytical technique (negative ESI-HRMS) are standard. The provided mass values are accepted monoisotopic masses. The setup is self-contained and free from contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a valid exercise in applying fundamental principles of mass spectrometry.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Exact Mass-to-Charge Ratio**\n\nThe neutral molecule, denoted by $\\mathrm{M}$, has the elemental composition $\\mathrm{C_8HF_{15}O_2}$. The exact mass of the neutral molecule, $m(\\mathrm{M})$, is the sum of the monoisotopic masses of its constituent atoms.\n\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 8 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) + 1 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{^1H}) + 15 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{^{19}F}) + 2 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{^{16}O})$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 8 \\cdot (12.000000) + 1 \\cdot (1.007825) + 15 \\cdot (18.998403) + 2 \\cdot (15.994915)$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 96.000000 + 1.007825 + 284.976045 + 31.989830$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 414.008700 \\text{ u}$$\n\nThe problem states that the ion observed is the deprotonated molecular anion, $\\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-}$. This species is formed by the removal of a proton, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, from the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$\\mathrm{M} \\longrightarrow \\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$$\nThe mass of the resulting ion, $m_{\\text{ion}}$, is therefore the mass of the neutral molecule minus the mass of a proton, $m_p$. The problem explicitly provides the value for $m_p$.\n\n$$m_{\\text{ion}} = m(\\mathrm{M}) - m_p$$\n$$m_{\\text{ion}} = 414.008700 - 1.0072764669$$\n$$m_{\\text{ion}} = 412.9664235331 \\text{ u}$$\n\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, is defined as the ion's mass divided by the magnitude of its charge number, $|z|$. For the singly charged anion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-}$, the charge number is $z = -1$, so $|z|=1$.\n\n$$m/z = \\frac{m_{\\text{ion}}}{|z|} = \\frac{412.9664235331}{1} = 412.9664235331$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $8$ significant figures.\nThe value is $412.9664235331$. The first $8$ significant figures are $4$, $1$, $2$, $9$, $6$, $6$, $4$, $2$. The ninth significant figure is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n\nThe final calculated $m/z$ is $412.96642$.\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of HRMS Constraints on Elemental Formulas**\n\nHigh-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) provides a measurement of an ion's $m/z$ with high precision, which in turn imposes stringent constraints on its possible elemental composition. This capability arises from the fundamental principle of mass defect.\n\nThe exact mass of any nuclide (except for $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$, by definition) is not an integer. The difference between a nuclide's exact mass and its integer mass number (the total count of protons and neutrons) is its mass defect. For the elements in question:\n- $m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) = 12.000000$ u; Mass Defect = $0$\n- $m(\\mathrm{^1H}) = 1.007825$ u; Mass Defect = $+0.007825$ u\n- $m(\\mathrm{^{16}O}) = 15.994915$ u; Mass Defect = $-0.005085$ u\n- $m(\\mathrm{^{19}F}) = 18.998403$ u; Mass Defect = $-0.001597$ u\n\nHydrogen possesses a significant positive mass defect, while oxygen and fluorine possess negative mass defects. The exact mass of a molecule or ion is the sum of the exact masses of its constituent atoms, and its total mass defect is the sum of the individual atomic mass defects.\n\nAn HRMS instrument with a mass accuracy of $\\pm 2$ parts-per-million (ppm) can distinguish between ions whose masses differ by a very small amount. For our calculated $m/z$ of approximately $412.97$, a $2$ ppm error tolerance corresponds to an absolute mass window of:\n$$\\Delta m = \\frac{2}{10^6} \\times 412.97 \\approx 0.000826 \\text{ u}$$\nAny proposed elemental formula for the measured ion must have a theoretical exact mass that falls within the narrow range of $m/z_{\\text{measured}} \\pm 0.000826$ u.\n\nThis drastically constrains the number of possible formulas without an exhaustive search for the following reason: most substitutions of atoms or groups of atoms, even those that preserve the nominal (integer) mass, produce a change in exact mass far greater than the HRMS tolerance window.\n\nConsider the ion studied, whose neutral formula portion is $\\mathrm{C_8F_{15}O_2}$. Suppose we hypothesize an alternative formula by making a substitution that is nearly isobaric (i.e., has the same nominal mass). A classic near-isobaric pair is the hydroxyl radical and three hydrogens ($\\mathrm{OH_3}$, nominal mass $19$) and fluorine ($\\mathrm{F}$, nominal mass $19$).\nLet's test swapping one $\\mathrm{F}$ atom in our formula for one $\\mathrm{OH_3}$ group. The new trial formula would be $\\mathrm{C_8(OH_3)F_{14}O_2}$, which simplifies to $\\mathrm{C_8H_3F_{14}O_3}$.\nThe change in mass, $\\Delta m_{\\text{subst}}$, resulting from this substitution is:\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{subst}} = m(\\mathrm{O}) + 3 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H}) - m(\\mathrm{F})$$\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{subst}} = 15.994915 + 3 \\cdot (1.007825) - 18.998403$$\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{subst}} = 15.994915 + 3.023475 - 18.998403 = 19.018390 - 18.998403 = +0.019987 \\text{ u}$$\n\nThis mass difference of approximately $+0.02$ u is more than $20$ times larger than the instrument's tolerance window of $\\sim \\pm 0.0008$ u. Therefore, HRMS can unequivocally distinguish between the true formula and this alternative. The same principle applies to other potential substitutions (e.g., swapping $\\mathrm{O}$ for $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ yields $\\Delta m = m(\\mathrm{C}) + 4 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H}) - m(\\mathrm{O}) = +0.036385$ u).\n\nIn conclusion, HRMS constrains elemental formulas by leveraging mass defects. The unique mass defect signature of a specific combination of atoms results in a highly specific exact mass. Because the mass tolerance of an HRMS instrument is exceptionally small, it acts as a powerful filter. Instead of an unguided, exhaustive enumeration of all possible $\\mathrm{C_c H_h F_f O_o}$ combinations, one can immediately discard nearly all candidates because the slight changes in their elemental makeup lead to deviations in exact mass that fall well outside the narrow acceptance window defined by the ppm accuracy. This reduces a computationally intractable problem to identifying a single, or a very small number of, plausible chemical formulas.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{412.96642}\n$$", "id": "3714846"}, {"introduction": "Beyond a single exact mass, the isotopic distribution of elements provides a rich layer of information for structural elucidation.

The goal is to predict the bromine-driven isotope pattern at high mass resolution and to rationalize how one can distinguish mono- versus dibromination from the observed pattern. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$, and for singly charged anions the magnitude of the charge is $|z|=1$, so $m/z$ differences between isotopologues equal their exact mass differences; (ii) isotopic composition arises from statistically independent substitution by available isotopes with fixed natural fractional abundances; (iii) the intensity of each isotopologue peak is proportional to its probability of occurrence in the ensemble of molecules; (iv) monoisotopic exact masses for bromine isotopes are fixed and known.\n\nYou are given the monoisotopic exact masses for bromine as $m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})=78.918338$ and $m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br})=80.916291$ (in daltons, Da), and the natural fractional abundances $a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})=0.5069$ and $a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br})=0.4931$.

Monobrominated Phenolic $[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ Ion**\n\nLet the molecular formula of the non-brominated part of the phenolic compound be denoted by $\\mathrm{R'}$. The full molecule $\\mathrm{M}$ is then $\\mathrm{R'Br}$. The observed ion is $[\\mathrm{R'Br}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$. The mass of this ion depends on which of the two stable bromine isotopes, $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ or $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$, is present.\n\nThis leads to two primary isotopologues for the $[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ ion:\n- The lighter isotopologue, containing $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$, which we will denote as $I_{A}$. Its mass is $m_A = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$.\n- The heavier isotopologue, containing $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$, which we will denote as $I_{A+2}$. Its mass is $m_{A+2} = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$.\n\nThe corresponding measured $m/z$ values are $(m/z)_A = m_A$ and $(m/z)_{A+2} = m_{A+2}$ since $|z|=1$.\n\nThe expected $m/z$ spacing of the doublet is the difference between these two values:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = (m/z)_{A+2} - (m/z)_A = m_{A+2} - m_A\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = (m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})) - (m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H}))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values for the bromine isotope masses:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = 80.916291 \\text{ Da} - 78.918338 \\text{ Da} = 1.997953 \\text{ Da}\n$$\nThis is the exact separation between the two peaks of the isotopic doublet.\n\nThe relative intensity of each peak is proportional to the probability of that isotopologue's existence, which is determined by the natural fractional abundance of the respective bromine isotope. Let $I_A$ and $I_{A+2}$ be the intensities of the lower and higher mass peaks, respectively.\n$$\nI_A \\propto a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) = 0.5069\n$$\n$$\nI_{A+2} \\propto a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) = 0.4931\n$$\nThe expected relative intensity ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{A+2}}{I_A} = \\frac{a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br})}{a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})} = \\frac{0.4931}{0.5069} \\approx 0.97277\n$$\nThe two peaks are thus expected to have nearly equal intensities, with a ratio of approximately $100:97.3$. This characteristic $1:1$ doublet pattern with a spacing of $\\approx 2~\\mathrm{Da}$ is the signature of a single bromine atom.\n\n**2. Dibrominated Phenolic $[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ Ion**\n\nFor a dibrominated compound, denoted $\\mathrm{R'Br}_2$, the observed ion is $[\\mathrm{R'Br_2}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$. Since there are two bromine atoms, and the selection of the isotope for each atom is an independent event, we can model the probabilities using a binomial expansion. Let $p = a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) = 0.5069$ and $q = a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) = 0.4931$.\n\nThree isotopologue combinations are possible:\n- Two $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms: $(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{79}\\mathrm{Br})$. This gives the monoisotopic peak, which we will use as the baseline, denoted $I_A$.\n- One $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ and one $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$ atom: $(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{81}\\mathrm{Br})$. This gives the peak conventionally labeled $I_{A+2}$.\n- Two $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms: $(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{81}\\mathrm{Br})$. This gives the peak labeled $I_{A+4}$.\n\nThe $m/z$ positions relative to the monoisotopic baseline ($m/z$ of the $I_A$ peak) are derived as follows:\n- The mass of the $I_A$ isotopologue is $m_A = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + 2m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$. Let its $m/z$ be $(m/z)_A$.\n- The mass of the $I_{A+2}$ isotopologue is $m_{A+2} = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) + m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$. The shift from baseline is:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)_{A+2} = m_{A+2} - m_A = m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) = 1.997953 \\text{ Da}\n$$\n- The mass of the $I_{A+4}$ isotopologue is $m_{A+4} = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + 2m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$. The shift from baseline is:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)_{A+4} = m_{A+4} - m_A = 2(m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})) = 2 \\times 1.997953 \\text{ Da} = 3.995906 \\text{ Da}\n$$\nThus, a triplet of peaks is expected, with adjacent peaks separated by a constant $m/z$ spacing of $1.997953~\\mathrm{Da}$.\n\nThe relative intensities are determined by the probabilities of these combinations:\n- Intensity $I_A$: Proportional to the probability of having two $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms, which is $p^2$.\n$$\np^2 = (0.5069)^2 \\approx 0.25694761\n$$\n- Intensity $I_{A+2}$: Proportional to the probability of having one $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ and one $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$ atom. There are two ways this can happen ($(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{81}\\mathrm{Br})$ and $(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{79}\\mathrm{Br})$), so the probability is $2pq$.\n$$\n2pq = 2 \\times 0.5069 \\times 0.4931 \\approx 0.49993358\n$$\n- Intensity $I_{A+4}$: Proportional to the probability of having two $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms, which is $q^2$.\n$$\nq^2 = (0.4931)^2 \\approx 0.24314761\n$$\nThe expected relative intensity ratio is $I_A:I_{A+2}:I_{A+4} = p^2 : 2pq : q^2$. Using the calculated values, the ratio is approximately $0.257 : 0.500 : 0.243$. Normalizing to the most intense peak ($I_{A+2}$) gives a ratio of approximately $51.4:100:48.6$. This is a characteristic $1:2:1$ pattern.\n\n**3. Distinguishing Mono- versus Dibromination**\n\nThe results derived above provide a clear and unambiguous method for distinguishing between monobromination and dibromination from the negative-ion mass spectrum, without any knowledge of the molecular backbone (the C-H-O composition). The distinction rests on two key features of the observed isotope pattern in the molecular ion region:\n\n1.  **Number of Peaks:** A monobrominated compound produces a characteristic **doublet** (two main peaks). In contrast, a dibrominated compound produces a characteristic **triplet** (three main peaks). This is the most immediate distinguishing feature.\n\n2.  **Relative Intensity Pattern:** The intensity ratios of the peaks within the cluster are distinctly different.\n    - For monobromination, the two peaks of the doublet have nearly equal intensities, with a ratio of $a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) : a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) \\approx 1:1$.\n    - For dibromination, the three peaks of the triplet exhibit a binomial intensity distribution of $p^2 : 2pq : q^2 \\approx 1:2:1$. The central peak is the most abundant, approximately twice as intense as either of the flanking peaks.\n\nThe underlying chemical composition of the phenolic moiety (the $\\mathrm{R'}$ part) only determines the absolute $m/z$ value at which this pattern appears, effectively shifting the entire cluster along the $m/z$ axis. However, the internal structure of the cluster—the number of peaks, their precise spacing ($\\approx 1.998~\\mathrm{Da}$), and their relative intensity pattern—is determined solely by the number of bromine atoms in the molecule. Therefore, by observing a doublet of $\\approx 1:1$ intensity ratio versus a triplet of $\\approx 1:2:1$ intensity ratio, one can confidently assign the compound as mono- or dibrominated, respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.997953}$$", "id": "3714812"}, {"introduction": "In electrospray ionization, ions are often formed not by deprotonation but by the association of a neutral molecule with an anion from the mobile phase, creating an adduct.

The mass of an anion is the mass of its neutral counterpart plus the mass of the excess electron(s).\n$$m_{ion} = m_{neutral} + m_{e}$$\n$$m_{ion} = 243.065735 \\text{ u} + 5.485799 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ u}$$\n$$m_{ion} = 243.065735 \\text{ u} + 0.0005485799 \\text{ u}$$\n$$m_{ion} = 243.0662835799 \\text{ u}$$\n\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, is defined as the ion's mass divided by the magnitude of its charge number, $|z|$. For a singly charged ion, $|z| = 1$.\n$$m/z = \\frac{m_{ion}}{|z|} = \\frac{243.0662835799 \\text{ u}}{1} = 243.0662835799 \\text{ Th}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to seven significant figures. The calculated value is $243.0662835799$. The first seven significant figures are $2$, $4$, $3$, $0$, $6$, $6$, $2$. The eighth significant figure is $8$, so we round up the seventh digit.\n$$m/z \\approx 243.0663~\\mathrm{Th}$$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we discuss the isotopic pattern features that would be diagnostic of acetate adduction. The in-source formation of an adduct $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{COO}\\right]^{-}$ results in an ion with a composition of $\\mathrm{C}_{14}\\mathrm{H}_{11}\\mathrm{O}_{4}$ plus an electron. This is distinct from an ion formed from the analyte M alone, such as a deprotonated ion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-}$ ($\\mathrm{C}_{12}\\mathrm{H}_{7}\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$). The diagnostic features arise from the change in elemental composition, specifically the addition of $2$ carbon atoms and $2$ oxygen atoms.\n\nThe relative intensity of the A+1 isotope peak (where A is the monoisotopic peak) is primarily determined by the number of carbon atoms, due to the natural abundance of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ ($\\approx 1.1\\%$).\nA simplified rule of thumb for the A+1 intensity is $I(\\mathrm{A}+1) \\approx N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\times 1.1\\%$.\nFor the analyte-only ion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-}$ ($N_{\\mathrm{C}}=12$), the A+1 peak would be approximately $12 \\times 1.1\\% = 13.2\\%$ of the monoisotopic peak.\nFor the acetate adduct ($N_{\\mathrm{C}}=14$), the A+1 peak intensity increases to approximately $14 \\times 1.1\\% = 15.4\\%$. This increase, while significant, might not be uniquely diagnostic on its own.\n\nA more telling feature is the intensity of the A+2 isotope peak. The A+2 intensity is governed by the probability of having two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms or one heavy isotope of other elements, most notably $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ (natural abundance $\\approx 0.205\\%$).\nThe A+2 intensity can be approximated by the formula $I(\\mathrm{A}+2) \\approx \\frac{(N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\times 1.1\\%)^2}{2} + N_{\\mathrm{O}} \\times 0.205\\%$.\nFor the analyte-only ion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-}$ ($N_{\\mathrm{C}}=12$, $N_{\\mathrm{O}}=2$), the A+2 intensity would be approximately $\\frac{(12 \\times 0.011)^2}{2} + 2 \\times 0.00205 \\approx 0.0087 + 0.0041 = 0.0128$, or $1.28\\%$.\nFor the acetate adduct ($N_{\\mathrm{C}}=14$, $N_{\\mathrm{O}}=4$), the A+2 intensity is approximately $\\frac{(14 \\times 0.011)^2}{2} + 4 \\times 0.00205 \\approx 0.0119 + 0.0082 = 0.0201$, or $2.01\\%$.\n\nThe key diagnostic feature is the significant enhancement of the A+2 peak relative to both the monoisotopic peak (A) and the A+1 peak. Doubling the number of oxygen atoms from $2$ to $4$ directly doubles the contribution of $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ to the A+2 signal. This leads to a noticeably \"heavier\" A+2 peak than would be expected for a molecule of that mass containing only $2$ oxygen atoms. In summary, while the A+1 peak intensity increases, the more definitive qualitative evidence for acetate adduction in the HRMS spectrum would be the disproportionately large intensity of the A+2 isotopic peak due to the increased count of both carbon and, critically, oxygen atoms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{243.0663}$$", "id": "3714832"}]}
