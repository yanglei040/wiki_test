The Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) provides a quick and powerful calculation to determine the total number of rings and multiple bonds within a neutral molecule. This practice will guide you through deriving the DBE formula from first principles and applying it to a fragment, a foundational skill for narrowing down the vast space of possible chemical structures [@problem_id:3726458].", "problem": "A high-resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) experiment on a protonated organic precursor ion generates a prominent neutral fragment that is proposed, based on exact mass difference and isotopic pattern analysis, to have the elemental composition $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\mathrm{Cl}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) is a count of the total number of rings and multiple bonds (excluding $\\mathrm{C-H}$ and $\\mathrm{C-X}$, where $\\mathrm{X}$ denotes halogens) in a neutral species. Starting from fundamental valence considerations for neutral organic compounds and the well-tested fact that a fully saturated, acyclic hydrocarbon with $C$ carbon atoms has formula $\\mathrm{C}_{C}\\mathrm{H}_{2C+2}$, derive a general expression for the DBE of a neutral fragment that may contain carbon ($C$), hydrogen ($H$), nitrogen ($N$), and halogens ($X$), but may also contain oxygen (which does not affect saturation count). Then, apply your derived expression to the proposed neutral fragment composition $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\mathrm{Cl}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to compute the DBE. Use your DBE to state the total number of rings plus double bonds that any valid structural realization of this neutral fragment must possess. Express the final DBE value as a pure number with no units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of organic chemistry and mass spectrometry, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its language. The problem requires the derivation of a fundamental formula and its application to a specific case, which is a standard and meaningful exercise in chemical structure elucidation.\n\nThe Double Bond Equivalent (DBE), also known as the degree of unsaturation, for a given molecular formula represents the number of rings plus the number of $\\pi$ bonds (double bonds count as one, triple bonds count as two) present in a molecule. The derivation of the general formula for DBE is based on comparing the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule to the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible for a saturated, acyclic structure with the same number of \"backbone\" atoms.\n\n1.  **Reference Saturated Hydrocarbon:** The problem states that a fully saturated, acyclic hydrocarbon containing $C$ carbon atoms has the molecular formula $\\mathrm{C}_{C}\\mathrm{H}_{2C+2}$. Thus, the maximum number of hydrogen atoms for $C$ carbons is $H_{max} = 2C+2$.\n\n2.  **Hydrogen Deficiency:** The DBE for a hydrocarbon $\\mathrm{C}_{C}\\mathrm{H}_{H}$ is calculated by finding the difference between the maximum possible number of hydrogens and the actual number of hydrogens, and dividing by $2$, since the formation of each ring or $\\pi$ bond results in the loss of two hydrogen atoms.\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = \\frac{H_{max} - H}{2} = \\frac{(2C+2) - H}{2} $$\n\n3.  **Incorporating Heteroatoms:** We must adjust the formula to account for elements other than carbon and hydrogen. We consider a general neutral species with the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{C}\\mathrm{H}_{H}\\mathrm{N}_{N}\\mathrm{X}_{X}\\mathrm{O}_{O}$, where $X$ represents a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).\n\n    -   **Halogens ($X$):** Halogen atoms are monovalent and form single bonds. In the context of saturation, a halogen atom is equivalent to a hydrogen atom. It can replace a hydrogen without changing the degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total number of \"hydrogen-equivalent\" atoms in the molecule is the sum of hydrogen and halogen atoms, $H + X$.\n\n    -   **Oxygen ($O$):** Oxygen atoms are divalent. An oxygen atom can be inserted into a C-C bond (forming an ether, C-O-C) or a C-H bond (forming an alcohol, C-O-H) without affecting the number of hydrogen atoms required for full saturation. For example, the saturated acyclic propane is $\\mathrm{C}_{3}\\mathrm{H}_{8}$, and both propan-1-ol ($\\mathrm{C}_{3}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}$) and ethyl methyl ether ($\\mathrm{C}_{3}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}$) are also saturated. Therefore, oxygen atoms do not affect the DBE calculation and can be ignored.\n\n    -   **Nitrogen ($N$):** Nitrogen atoms are typically trivalent in neutral organic molecules. When a nitrogen atom is incorporated into a saturated, acyclic skeleton, it increases the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms by one compared to a carbon atom. For a saturated acyclic molecule with $C$ carbons and $N$ nitrogens, the maximum number of hydrogen atoms is $H_{max} = 2C+2+N$. This can be rationalized by considering that replacing a $\\mathrm{CH}$ group with a trivalent $\\mathrm{N}$ atom requires an additional hydrogen atom to be bonded to the nitrogen to maintain saturation.\n\n4.  **General DBE Formula:** Combining these considerations, for a molecule with the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{C}\\mathrm{H}_{H}\\mathrm{N}_{N}\\mathrm{X}_{X}\\mathrm{O}_{O}$, the maximum number of hydrogens for a corresponding saturated acyclic structure is $H_{max} = 2C + 2 + N$. The actual count of hydrogen-equivalent atoms is $H_{effective} = H + X$. The DBE is the number of pairs of hydrogens a molecule is \"missing\" relative to this saturated reference.\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = \\frac{H_{max} - H_{effective}}{2} = \\frac{(2C + 2 + N) - (H + X)}{2} $$\nThis can also be written in the commonly used alternative form:\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = C - \\frac{H}{2} - \\frac{X}{2} + \\frac{N}{2} + 1 $$\nWe will use the first form for the calculation.\n\n5.  **Application to the Given Fragment:** The problem provides the elemental composition of the neutral fragment as $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\mathrm{Cl}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$. We identify the number of each relevant atom:\n    -   Number of carbon atoms, $C = 8$.\n    -   Number of hydrogen atoms, $H = 6$.\n    -   Number of halogen atoms, $X = 1$ (one chlorine atom).\n    -   Number of nitrogen atoms, $N = 1$.\n    -   Number of oxygen atoms, $O = 2$ (these are ignored in the calculation).\n\n6.  **Calculation:** We substitute these values into the derived general expression for DBE:\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = \\frac{(2C + 2 + N) - (H + X)}{2} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = \\frac{(2 \\times 8 + 2 + 1) - (6 + 1)}{2} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = \\frac{(16 + 2 + 1) - 7}{2} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = \\frac{19 - 7}{2} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = \\frac{12}{2} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{DBE} = 6 $$\n\nThe calculated Double Bond Equivalent is $6$. This integer value indicates that any valid structural isomer of the neutral fragment with composition $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\mathrm{Cl}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ must possess a total of six rings and/or multiple (double or triple) bonds. For example, this could be a benzene ring (DBE=$4$), a nitro group (DBE=$1$), and a carbonyl group (DBE=$1$), summing to $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "3726458"}, {"introduction": "Proposing a molecular formula for a fragment is only half the battle; validating it against high-resolution mass spectrometry data requires a quantitative assessment of the measurement's accuracy.

Since $2.215 < 3.51$, the measurement is consistent with the hypothesized formula within a $k=2$ interval, supporting the assignment. However, the proximity of the error to the combined uncertainty signals that competing elemental compositions with similar theoretical masses could still be plausible, particularly if additional systematic effects (isolation window bias, space-charge shifts, or energy-dependent ion chemistry in MS/MS) are present.

Under low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID), two dominant product ions are observed: $B^+$ at $m/z = 182$ and $C^+$ at $m/z = 164$. Two mechanistic hypotheses are under consideration:\n\n- Parallel primary pathways: $[M+H]^+ \\xrightarrow{k_B(E)} B^+ + \\mathrm{neutral}$ and $[M+H]^+ \\xrightarrow{k_C(E)} C^+ + \\mathrm{neutral}$, where $k_B(E)$ and $k_C(E)$ are microcanonical unimolecular rate constants that increase with internal energy $E$.\n- Sequential fragmentation: $[M+H]^+ \\xrightarrow{k_1(E)} B^+ + \\mathrm{neutral}$ followed by $B^+ \\xrightarrow{k_2(E)} C^+ + \\mathrm{neutral}$.\n\nYour task is to design an experiment that can discriminate between these mechanistic possibilities by analyzing the dependence of product ion appearance on collision energy and on the effective observation time within the activation cell. You may assume standard, well-tested facts:\n\n- In collision-induced dissociation, the internal energy distribution of ions can be tuned by the laboratory collision energy $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$ (or normalized collision energy), collision gas pressure $p$, and activation time $t$.\n- For a single-step unimolecular dissociation, observability within a finite time window $t$ requires approximately $k(E) t \\gtrsim 1$; the measured appearance energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is thus a time-dependent kinetic threshold, often called a kinetic shift relative to the critical energy.\n- For a consecutive two-step pathway $A \\to B \\to C$, observability of $C$ within time $t$ requires that both steps proceed sufficiently rapidly within $t$, leading to a stronger dependence of the effective onset condition on $t$ than for a single-step pathway.\n\nWhich of the following experimental designs and diagnostic signatures most directly and unambiguously separate a sequential $[M+H]^+ \\to B^+ \\to C^+$ mechanism from parallel primary pathways?\n\nA. Use a quadrupole ion trap to perform energy-resolved $MS/MS$ at multiple activation times $t$ (e.g., $t = 3$, $10$, and $30$ ms) and at two collision gas pressures $p$ that differ by a factor of $2$, extracting appearance energies $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ for $B^+$ and $C^+$ at each condition. Then perform $MS^3$ by isolating $B^+$ and subjecting it to $\\mathrm{CID}$ to test for direct formation of $C^+$. Conclude sequential if $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(C^+)$ exhibits a pronounced downward shift with increasing $t$ (significantly larger than that of $B^+$), and $C^+$ is observed in $MS^3$ from $B^+$. Conclude parallel if $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(B^+)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(C^+)$ shift similarly with $t$ and $C^+$ is absent in $MS^3$ of $B^+$.\n\nB. Use a triple quadrupole in beam-type $\\mathrm{CID}$ at a single high collision energy $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$ sufficient to fully deplete $[M+H]^+$, and infer mechanism by the intensity ratio $I(C^+)/I(B^+)$.

Record breakdown curves only as a function of $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$. If the measured onset energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(C^+)$ is higher than $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(B^+)$ at this fixed $t$, infer a sequential mechanism; if the onsets are similar, infer parallel pathways.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "We begin with the fundamental definitions and well-tested facts governing collision-induced dissociation and unimolecular reaction kinetics. For a single-step channel with microcanonical rate constant $k(E)$ and an effective observation time window $t$, detection of product requires approximately $k(E) t \\gtrsim 1$. Thus, the measured appearance energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ for the product will depend on $t$ (the kinetic shift): as $t$ increases, the minimum $E$ needed to satisfy $k(E) t \\gtrsim 1$ decreases, shifting $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ to lower values. For a two-step sequence $A \\xrightarrow{k_1(E)} B \\xrightarrow{k_2(E)} C$, $C$ becomes detectable only when both steps occur within the time window $t$, which invokes a more stringent condition. A simple way to see the increased time dependence is to note that, in the early-time limit where both steps are rate limiting and approximately first order, the probability to reach $C$ scales approximately as $[1 - \\exp(-k_1(E) t)][1 - \\exp(-k_2(E) t)] \\approx k_1(E) k_2(E) t^2$ for small $k_i(E) t$. Therefore, detection of $C$ requires $k_1(E) k_2(E) t^2 \\gtrsim \\alpha$, for some instrument-dependent constant $\\alpha$ defining detectability. Compared to the single-step condition $k(E) t \\gtrsim 1$, the two-step condition demonstrates a stronger dependence on $t$: increasing $t$ reduces the required $E$ more dramatically for the sequential channel. In addition, energy-resolved tandem mass spectrometry can map appearance energies $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ as a function of $t$ and collision gas pressure $p$ (which modulates the rate of collisional energy uptake), providing a diagnostic for sequential versus parallel kinetics. Finally, a direct mechanistic test exists: if $C^+$ is predominantly formed via $B^+$, then isolating $B^+$ and subjecting it to a subsequent activation stage ($MS^3$) should yield $C^+$ under suitable conditions; if $C^+$ is an independent primary product, $MS^3$ of $B^+$ will not produce $C^+$ (beyond trivial isobaric interferences).\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nOption A: This design combines two orthogonal diagnostics grounded in the above principles.\n\n- Energy- and time-resolved appearance energies: Measuring $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(B^+)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(C^+)$ at multiple $t$ and $p$ directly tests the kinetic shift predictions. For a single-step product (parallel pathway), the onset follows approximately $k(E) t \\gtrsim 1$, so increasing $t$ shifts $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ to lower values by an amount characteristic of that channel. For a sequential product, the earliest detection requires satisfying a two-step condition, effectively $k_1(E) k_2(E) t^2 \\gtrsim \\alpha$, which causes $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(C^+)$ to exhibit a more pronounced downward shift with $t$ compared to $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(B^+)$ (which is only one step away from the precursor). Therefore, a significantly larger $t$-dependence for $C^+$ than for $B^+$ is expected for a sequential mechanism, whereas similar $t$-dependences for both products suggest parallel primary channels.\n- $MS^3$ verification: Isolating $B^+$ and activating it in a second stage directly tests whether $B^+$ can produce $C^+$. Observation of $C^+$ in $MS^3$ from $B^+$ under conditions where $B^+$ is activated to comparable internal energies gives strong evidence for a sequential pathway. Conversely, absence of $C^+$ in $MS^3$ supports parallel pathways.\n\nVarying $p$ by a factor of $2$ modulates the rate of collisional heating and the number of effective excitations during $t$, which should further accentuate kinetic-shift differences between single- and double-step observables, while remaining within realistic operating conditions of a quadrupole ion trap. This integrated design is both mechanistically specific and grounded in well-tested energy- and time-dependence of unimolecular dissociation in $\\mathrm{CID}$. Therefore, Option A is Correct.\n\nOption B: This design uses a single, high $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$ point where the precursor is fully depleted and infers mechanism from the terminal intensity ratio $I(C^+)/I(B^+)$. This is not mechanistically diagnostic for sequential versus parallel pathways. At high energies, both parallel and sequential channels may be populated, and the final abundances are convolutions of formation and subsequent secondary depletion. In particular, in a sequential mechanism, $B^+$ abundance may decrease at high $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$ due to conversion to $C^+$, making $C^+$ dominant even if it is not a primary pathway; similarly, in parallel kinetics, differing rate constants and secondary losses can produce a wide range of final ratios. Without energy- or time-resolved data or $MS^3$ verification, this approach cannot distinguish the mechanisms. Therefore, Option B is Incorrect.\n\nOption C: High-resolution accurate-mass determination of elemental compositions is valuable for assigning neutral losses and structures, but it does not on its own distinguish whether $C^+$ arises in parallel from $[M+H]^+$ or sequentially via $B^+$. The fact that a neutral loss equals the sum of two typical losses is compatible with both a one-step concerted loss and a two-step sequence. Without the kinetic fingerprints (time-dependent $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$) or direct $MS^3$ lineage tests, this approach lacks the discriminating power required by the problem. Therefore, Option C is Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Measuring breakdown curves as a function of $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$ in a beam-type instrument with a fixed, very short residence time provides limited diagnostic information for sequential versus parallel mechanisms, precisely because the time window $t$ is fixed and small (microseconds). In that regime, $C^+$ from a sequential pathway may be kinetically inaccessible and appear only at very high $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$ due to an exacerbated kinetic shift; however, a higher $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(C^+)$ relative to $B^+$ does not uniquely imply sequential formation, since parallel primary channels can have different critical energies and intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution characteristics, and thus different thresholds. Without varying $t$ and without $MS^3$ verification, concluding mechanism from relative onsets at a single $t$ is not definitive. Therefore, Option D is Incorrect.\n\nIn summary, only Option A integrates the fundamental kinetic-shift logic ($k(E) t \\gtrsim 1$ for single-step versus an effectively stronger $t$-dependence for two-step formation) with a direct lineage test via $MS^3$, making it the single best strategy to discriminate sequential from parallel mechanisms using energy dependence and product-ion onset behavior.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3726462"}]}
