Substituting this into the expression for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\Delta t \\approx \\frac{t/\\sqrt{m}}{2\\sqrt{m}}\\Delta m = \\frac{t}{2m}\\Delta m$$\nRearranging this equation to match the form of the mass resolving power definition:\n$$\\frac{m}{\\Delta m} \\approx \\frac{t}{2\\Delta t}$$\nIdentifying $\\Delta t$ with the total temporal spread $\\Delta t_{\\text{tot}}$, the mass resolving power $R$ is given by:\n$$R = \\frac{t}{2\\Delta t_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nThis is the required relationship.\n\nNow we calculate the resolving power for the two scenarios.\n\n**Case 1: Prompt Extraction**\nFor prompt extraction, the plume-induced time spread is $\\Delta t_{\\text{plume,prompt}} = \\Delta t_{\\text{plume,0}} = 35.0\\,\\text{ns}$. The total temporal spread, $\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, prompt}}$, is given by the root-sum-of-squares of the detector and plume contributions:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, prompt}} = \\sqrt{\\Delta t_{\\text{det}}^2 + \\Delta t_{\\text{plume,prompt}}^2} = \\sqrt{(1.5\\,\\text{ns})^2 + (35.0\\,\\text{ns})^2}$$\nThe resolving power under prompt extraction is:\n$$R_{\\text{prompt}} = \\frac{t}{2\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, prompt}}} = \\frac{t}{2\\sqrt{(1.5\\,\\text{ns})^2 + (35.0\\,\\text{ns})^2}}$$\n\n**Case 2: Delayed Extraction**\nFor delayed extraction, the plume-induced time spread is reduced by the factor $\\kappa$:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{plume,delayed}} = \\kappa \\cdot \\Delta t_{\\text{plume,0}} = 0.30 \\times 35.0\\,\\text{ns} = 10.5\\,\\text{ns}$$\nThe total temporal spread, $\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, delayed}}$, is:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, delayed}} = \\sqrt{\\Delta t_{\\text{det}}^2 + \\Delta t_{\\text{plume,delayed}}^2} = \\sqrt{(1.5\\,\\text{ns})^2 + (10.5\\,\\text{ns})^2}$$\nThe resolving power under delayed extraction is:\n$$R_{\\text{delayed}} = \\frac{t}{2\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, delayed}}} = \\frac{t}{2\\sqrt{(1.5\\,\\text{ns})^2 + (10.5\\,\\text{ns})^2}}$$\n\n**Improvement Factor F**\nThe improvement factor $F$ is the ratio of the delayed extraction resolving power to the prompt extraction resolving power:\n$$F = \\frac{R_{\\text{delayed}}}{R_{\\text{prompt}}} = \\frac{\\frac{t}{2\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, delayed}}}}{\\frac{t}{2\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, prompt}}}} = \\frac{\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, prompt}}}{\\Delta t_{\\text{tot, delayed}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the temporal spreads:\n$$F = \\frac{\\sqrt{(1.5\\,\\text{ns})^2 + (35.0\\,\\text{ns})^2}}{\\sqrt{(1.5\\,\\text{ns})^2 + (10.5\\,\\text{ns})^2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values and calculate $F$. The units (ns) will cancel out.\n$$F = \\frac{\\sqrt{(1.5)^2 + (35.0)^2}}{\\sqrt{(1.5)^2 + (10.5)^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2.25 + 1225}}{\\sqrt{2.25 + 110.25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1227.25}}{\\sqrt{112.5}}$$\n$$F = \\sqrt{\\frac{1227.25}{112.5}} \\approx \\sqrt{10.90888...} \\approx 3.302859...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F \\approx 3.303$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.303}$$", "id": "3710356"}]}
