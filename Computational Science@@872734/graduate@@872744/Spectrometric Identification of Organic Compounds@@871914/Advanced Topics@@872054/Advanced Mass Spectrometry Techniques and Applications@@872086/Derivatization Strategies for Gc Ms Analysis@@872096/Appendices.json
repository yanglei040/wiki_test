The task is divided into a quantitative calculation of a mass shift and a qualitative prediction of changes in analytical behavior. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are scientifically sound.\n\nThe solution will be presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Monoisotopic Mass Shift ($\\Delta m$)\n\nThe problem describes the derivatization of a generic carboxylic acid, $\\mathrm{R{-}COOH}$, to its corresponding methyl ester, $\\mathrm{R{-}COOCH_{3}}$, using methanol. This reaction is a Fischer esterification, where the acidic proton of the carboxyl group is replaced by a methyl group. The overall chemical transformation can be represented as:\n$$ \\mathrm{R{-}COOH} + \\mathrm{CH_3OH} \\xrightarrow{H^+} \\mathrm{R{-}COOCH_3} + \\mathrm{H_2O} $$\nTo find the mass shift, $\\Delta m$, between the product (methyl ester) and the reactant (carboxylic acid), we need to determine the net change in atomic composition. By comparing the structures $\\mathrm{R{-}COOH}$ and $\\mathrm{R{-}COOCH_{3}}$, we can see that one hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H}$) is removed from the carboxylic acid and one methyl group ($\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$) is added.\n\nThe net change in atomic composition is the addition of one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms ($\\mathrm{CH_{3}} - \\mathrm{H} = \\mathrm{CH_{2}}$). The mass shift, $\\Delta m$, is the difference between the mass of the added group and the mass of the removed atom.\n\nMass of atoms added = mass of a methyl group, $m(\\text{CH}_3)$\nMass of atom removed = mass of a hydrogen atom, $m(\\text{H})$\n\n$$ \\Delta m = m(\\text{CH}_3) - m(\\text{H}) $$\n\nThe problem specifies the use of monoisotopic masses. Using the provided values, $m(^{12}\\text{C}) = 12.000000~\\text{Da}$ and $m(^{1}\\text{H}) = 1.007825~\\text{Da}$.\n\nThe mass of the methyl group consists of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms:\n$$ m(\\text{CH}_3) = m(^{12}\\text{C}) + 3 \\times m(^{1}\\text{H}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ m(\\text{CH}_3) = 12.000000~\\text{Da} + 3 \\times (1.007825~\\text{Da}) = 12.000000~\\text{Da} + 3.023475~\\text{Da} = 15.023475~\\text{Da} $$\n\nThe mass of the removed hydrogen atom is:\n$$ m(\\text{H}) = m(^{1}\\text{H}) = 1.007825~\\text{Da} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the exact mass shift, $\\Delta m$:\n$$ \\Delta m = 15.023475~\\text{Da} - 1.007825~\\text{Da} = 14.015650~\\text{Da} $$\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the mass of the net change, which is the addition of a methylene group, $\\text{CH}_2$:\n$$ \\Delta m = m(\\text{CH}_2) = m(^{12}\\text{C}) + 2 \\times m(^{1}\\text{H}) $$\n$$ \\Delta m = 12.000000~\\text{Da} + 2 \\times (1.007825~\\text{Da}) $$\n$$ \\Delta m = 12.000000~\\text{Da} + 2.015650~\\text{Da} = 14.015650~\\text{Da} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical value to be rounded to five significant figures. The calculated value is $14.015650$. The sixth significant digit is $6$, so we round up the fifth digit ($5$).\n$$ \\Delta m \\approx 14.016~\\text{Da} $$\n\n### Part 2: Qualitative Predictions\n\n**(i) Influence on GC Retention on a Non-polar Stationary Phase**\n\nThe retention of an analyte in gas chromatography on a non-polar stationary phase is primarily governed by its volatility, which is inversely related to its boiling point. Compounds with higher volatility (lower boiling point) travel through the column faster and thus have shorter retention times.\n\nA carboxylic acid ($\\mathrm{R{-}COOH}$) possesses a highly polar hydroxyl group ($-\\mathrm{OH}$) directly attached to a carbonyl group. This structure allows the molecule to act as both a hydrogen bond donor (via the acidic proton) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (via both oxygens). Consequently, carboxylic acids form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds with each other, often leading to the formation of stable dimers even in the gas phase. These strong intermolecular forces significantly decrease the molecule's volatility and increase its boiling point.\n\nWhen the carboxylic acid is converted to its methyl ester ($\\mathrm{R{-}COOCH_{3}}$), the acidic proton is replaced by a non-polar methyl group. The resulting ester functional group can still act as a hydrogen bond acceptor (at the oxygen atoms), but it can no longer act as a hydrogen bond donor. The elimination of hydrogen bonding capability between molecules drastically reduces the strength of intermolecular forces. The primary forces become weaker dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces.\n\nTherefore, the methyl ester is substantially more volatile (has a lower boiling point) than its parent carboxylic acid. This increased volatility leads to a significant **decrease in retention time** when analyzed on a non-polar GC column. The less polar and more volatile ester interacts less with the stationary phase and elutes much earlier and with better peak shape than the highly polar, adsorptive, and less volatile acid.\n\n**(ii) Influence on the EI Fragmentation Pattern**\n\nElectron Ionization (EI) at $70~\\text{eV}$ is a high-energy (\"hard\") ionization technique that induces extensive and reproducible fragmentation of organic molecules. The resulting mass spectrum is a fingerprint of the molecule's structure. Derivatization from a carboxylic acid to a methyl ester fundamentally alters the molecular structure, leading to a distinctively different fragmentation pattern.\n\n**Carboxylic Acid ($\\mathrm{R{-}COOH}$):**\n-   The molecular ion ($M^{\\cdot+}$) is often weak or entirely absent due to facile fragmentation.\n-   A common fragmentation pathway is alpha-cleavage, leading to the loss of the alkyl group $\\mathrm{R}\\cdot$ and formation of the $ [\\text{COOH}]^+ $ ion at $m/z~45$.\n-   Another key fragmentation is the loss of a hydroxyl radical ($\\cdot\\mathrm{OH}$), giving the acylium ion $[\\mathrm{R{-}CO}]^+$, corresponding to a mass loss of $17~\\text{Da}$.\n-   If the alkyl chain $\\mathrm{R}$ contains a hydrogen atom on the gamma-carbon relative to the carboxyl group, a McLafferty rearrangement can occur, leading to the elimination of a neutral alkene.\n\n**Methyl Ester ($\\mathrm{R{-}COOCH_{3}}$):**\n-   The molecular ion ($M^{\\cdot+}$) is generally more stable and thus more abundant than that of the parent acid, which aids in determining the molecular weight.\n-   The fragmentation pattern is dominated by cleavages adjacent to the carbonyl group. A highly characteristic fragmentation is the loss of the methoxy radical ($\\cdot\\mathrm{OCH_{3}}$), yielding a very stable and often abundant acylium ion $[\\mathrm{R{-}CO}]^+$. This corresponds to a mass loss of $31~\\text{Da}$.\n-   Loss of the alkyl group $\\mathrm{R}\\cdot$ leads to the formation of the $ [\\text{COOCH}_3]^+ $ ion at $m/z~59$.\n-   For esters with a long enough alkyl chain (at least a propyl group), the McLafferty rearrangement is a very prominent fragmentation pathway. This rearrangement results in the formation of a characteristic radical cation at $m/z~74$, corresponding to $ [\\text{CH}_2=\\text{C(OH)OCH}_3]^{\\cdot+} $. This ion is often the base peak in the spectrum and is diagnostic for methyl esters of straight-chain acids.\n\nIn summary, the derivatization is predicted to **stabilize the molecular ion** and produce a new set of characteristic fragments. The appearance of intense and diagnostic ions, such as the acylium ion from the loss of $m/z~31$ and the McLafferty rearrangement ion at $m/z~74$, makes the identification of the original carboxylic acid more confident and straightforward compared to the analysis of the underivatized acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.016}$$", "id": "3698799"}, {"introduction": "When analyzing complex molecules with multiple reactive sites, uniform derivatization is often not possible or desirable.

Select all that apply.\n\nA. The large tert-butyldimethylsilyl group enforces kinetic site selectivity by penalizing approach of hindered secondary alkoxides and carboxylates in the $\\mathrm{S_N}2$@Si transition state, so the primary alcohol is silylated fastest; the smaller trimethylsilyl reagents over-derivatize because their lower steric demand and superior leaving group enable reaction at all sites with similar rates.\n\nB.

Under pseudo-first-order conditions with a fixed excess of silylating reagent, diluting the trimethylsilyl reagent would not change the intrinsic selectivity ratio $(k_\\text{primary}/k_\\text{secondary})$, so over-derivatization driven by similar rates across sites cannot be remedied by dilution alone without changing reagent identity or conditions.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of organic reaction mechanisms, chemical kinetics, and spectrometric analysis. The data provided are internally consistent and realistic for the described experiment. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two silylation protocols for a trifunctional substrate, $\\mathrm{HO{-}CH_2{-}C_6H_{10}{-}CHOH{-}COOH}$, and evaluate several statements based on the provided kinetic, product distribution, and GC-MS data, in light of fundamental chemical principles. The two silylating agents are trimethylsilyl (TMS) from $\\mathrm{BSTFA/TMCS}$, which is small and highly reactive, and tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) from $\\mathrm{TBDMSCl/imidazole}$, which is bulky and less reactive. The three reactive sites on the substrate are a primary alcohol ($\\mathrm{-CH_2OH}$), a secondary alcohol ($\\mathrm{-CHOH}$), and a carboxylic acid ($\\mathrm{-COOH}$).\n\nThe silylation reaction is stated to proceed via an $\\mathrm{S_N}2$@Si mechanism, which involves the nucleophilic attack of a hydroxyl or carboxyl group on the silicon atom, passing through a pentacoordinate, trigonal bipyramidal transition state. The rate of this reaction is sensitive to steric hindrance, both on the nucleophile and on the electrophilic silicon atom. A higher activation free energy ($\\Delta G^\\ddagger$), often due to increased steric congestion in the transition state, leads to a lower rate constant ($k$), as described by the Eyring equation $k = \\kappa \\frac{k_B T}{h}\\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT})$.\n\nLet's analyze the provided data:\n\n**Kinetic Data (Pseudo-first-order rate constants, $k$):**\n- Protocol $\\mathrm{TMS}$: $k_\\text{primary} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_\\text{secondary} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_\\text{carboxyl} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThe rates are all high and of a similar order of magnitude. The selectivity, defined as the ratio of rates, is low. For example, the selectivity for the primary versus the secondary alcohol is $k_\\text{primary}/k_\\text{secondary} = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) / (8.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 1.5$.\n- Protocol $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$: $k_\\text{primary} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_\\text{secondary} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_\\text{carboxyl} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThe absolute rates are lower than for $\\mathrm{TMS}$, reflecting the greater steric bulk and possibly lower electrophilicity of the reagent. More importantly, the selectivity is much higher. The selectivity for the primary versus the secondary alcohol is $k_\\text{primary}/k_\\text{secondary} = (2.5 \\times 10^{-4}) / (2.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 12.5$. The primary alcohol is by far the most reactive site.\n\n**Product Distribution:**\n- Protocol $\\mathrm{TMS}$: Leads to $65\\%$ tri-silylated product. This is the expected outcome for a highly reactive system with low selectivity, where the reaction proceeds readily at all three sites.\n- Protocol $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$: Leads to $80\\%$ mono-silylated product. This is consistent with the kinetic data showing high selectivity for one site (the primary alcohol). The bulky $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ group effectively 'protects' the most accessible site and reacts very slowly with the more hindered sites.\n\n**GC-MS Data:**\n- Retention Times ($t_R$): For both protocols, $t_R$ increases with the degree of silylation (mono < di < tri). Comparing the two protocols, a $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ derivative elutes later than the corresponding $\\mathrm{TMS}$ derivative of the same degree of silylation (e.g., mono-$\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ $t_R = 11.5\\,\\mathrm{min}$ vs. mono-$\\mathrm{TMS}$ $t_R = 8.1\\,\\mathrm{min}$). This is consistent with principle (v): the larger, heavier $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ group leads to a higher molecular weight and stronger London dispersion forces, increasing the boiling point and thus retention time on a nonpolar column.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement:\n\n**A. The large tert-butyldimethylsilyl group enforces kinetic site selectivity by penalizing approach of hindered secondary alkoxides and carboxylates in the $\\mathrm{S_N}2$@Si transition state, so the primary alcohol is silylated fastest; the smaller trimethylsilyl reagents over-derivatize because their lower steric demand and superior leaving group enable reaction at all sites with similar rates.**\nThis statement accurately synthesizes the information. The large $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ group makes the $\\mathrm{S_N}2$@Si transition state highly sensitive to the steric environment of the nucleophile. The least hindered primary alcohol reacts fastest, as confirmed by the rate constants ($k_\\text{primary}$ is $12.5$-fold and $25$-fold faster than $k_\\text{secondary}$ and $k_\\text{carboxyl}$, respectively) and the product distribution ($80\\%$ mono-silylated product). Conversely, the small $\\mathrm{TMS}$ group is less sensitive to steric hindrance, and the high reactivity of the $\\mathrm{BSTFA}$ reagent system leads to fast reactions at all sites. The rates are similar ($1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$, $8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, and $9.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{s}^{-1}$), resulting in low selectivity and \"over-derivatization\" to the tri-silylated product ($65\\%$). This statement is fully consistent with the provided data and principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Trimethylsilyl reagents increase site selectivity by favoring only the least hindered site; therefore, they should produce predominantly mono-silylated product with negligible tri-silylation under the stated conditions.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect on two counts. First, the data clearly show that the $\\mathrm{TMS}$ reagent results in *lower* site selectivity ($k_\\text{primary}/k_\\text{secondary} = 1.5$) compared to the $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ reagent ($k_\\text{primary}/k_\\text{secondary} = 12.5$). It is the bulky $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ group, not the small $\\mathrm{TMS}$ group, that increases site selectivity. Second, the statement's conclusion that $\\mathrm{TMS}$ should produce predominantly mono-silylated product is directly contradicted by the product distribution data, which shows the major product ($65\\%$) is the tri-silylated derivative.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For derivatives of the same degree of substitution, tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives elute later than trimethylsilyl derivatives on a nonpolar GC column, consistent with their larger size and stronger dispersive interactions; the reported retention times reflect this trend.**\nThis statement consists of a correct principle and a check against the data. The principle is that on a nonpolar GC column, retention time generally increases with molecular weight and polarizability due to stronger van der Waals (dispersive) interactions. A $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ group ($\\mathrm{-Si(CH_3)_2C(CH_3)_3}$, $\\mathrm{MW} \\approx 115$) is significantly larger and heavier than a $\\mathrm{TMS}$ group ($\\mathrm{-Si(CH_3)_3}$, $\\mathrm{MW} \\approx 73$). Therefore, a $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$ derivative should elute later than a $\\mathrm{TMS}$ derivative. The data confirms this: for mono-derivatives, $t_{R,\\mathrm{TBDMS}} = 11.5\\,\\mathrm{min} > t_{R,\\mathrm{TMS}} = 8.1\\,\\mathrm{min}$; for di-derivatives, $t_{R,\\mathrm{TBDMS}} = 14.0\\,\\mathrm{min} > t_{R,\\mathrm{TMS}} = 10.2\\,\\mathrm{min}$. The statement is entirely accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. The appearance of $m/z~73$ uniquely identifies derivatization at the carboxylic acid, whereas $m/z~147$ denotes alcohol derivatization; therefore, the $\\mathrm{TMS}$ data prove selective silylation at the acid.**\nThis statement demonstrates a misunderstanding of mass spectrometry of silylated compounds. The ion at $m/z~73$ corresponds to the trimethylsilyl cation, $ [(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{Si}]^+ $. This is a characteristic and often the base peak for *any* $\\mathrm{TMS}$ derivative, including silyl ethers (from alcohols) and silyl esters (from carboxylic acids). It is not unique to silylated acids. The ion at $m/z~147$, often formulated as $ [(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{Si=O-Si}(\\text{CH}_3)_3]^+ $, is a common rearrangement fragment, particularly in molecules containing multiple silyl groups (e.g., bis-TMS ethers). It does not uniquely denote alcohol derivatization. Because the premise about the diagnostic value of these ions is false, the conclusion that the data prove selective silylation at the acid is unfounded. Furthermore, this conclusion contradicts the kinetic data, which shows the primary alcohol is the most reactive site, not the acid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Under pseudo-first-order conditions with a fixed excess of silylating reagent, diluting the trimethylsilyl reagent would not change the intrinsic selectivity ratio $(k_\\text{primary}/k_\\text{secondary})$, so over-derivatization driven by similar rates across sites cannot be remedied by dilution alone without changing reagent identity or conditions.**\nThis statement addresses the kinetics correctly. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constant for site $i$ is $k_i = k'_i \\times [\\mathrm{Reagent}]$, where $k'_i$ is the true second-order rate constant. The selectivity ratio between two sites is $k_\\text{primary}/k_\\text{secondary} = (k'_\\text{primary} \\times [\\mathrm{Reagent}]) / (k'_\\text{secondary} \\times [\\mathrm{Reagent}]) = k'_\\text{primary}/k'_\\text{secondary}$. This ratio of the true rate constants is an intrinsic property of the reacting system at a given temperature and is independent of the reagent concentration. Diluting the reagent would decrease all the observed rates proportionally, but the ratio—the selectivity—would remain unchanged. Because the TMS protocol suffers from low intrinsic selectivity, simply slowing down the reaction by dilution will not improve the final product distribution. The system would still tend towards the same mixture of products, including the major tri-silylated species; it would just take longer to get there. To improve the yield of a specific, less-than-fully-substituted intermediate, one must change the intrinsic selectivity, which requires changing the reagent (as in Protocol $\\mathrm{TBDMS}$) or reaction conditions like temperature.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3698743"}]}
