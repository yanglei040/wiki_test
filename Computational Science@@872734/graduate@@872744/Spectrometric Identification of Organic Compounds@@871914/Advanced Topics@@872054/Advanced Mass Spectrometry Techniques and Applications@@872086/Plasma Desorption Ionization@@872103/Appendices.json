In this case, adding $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ as a dopant increases the partial pressure of ammonia, $[\\mathrm{NH_3}]$. This disturbs the equilibrium. The reaction quotient, $Q = \\frac{ \\left[ [M+\\mathrm{H}]^+ \\right] \\left[ \\mathrm{NH}_3 \\right] }{ \\left[ [M+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+ \\right] }$, will momentarily become greater than the equilibrium constant $K$.

Consequently, the population of the ammonium adduct ion, $[M+\\mathrm{NH_4}]^+$, increases, while the population of the protonated molecule, $[M+\\mathrm{H}]^+$, decreases.

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution from First Principles\n\n**1. Mechanism of Mass-to-Charge Ratio ($m/z$) Shift**\n\nAn ion $\\mathrm{I}^{+}$ (in this case, $[M+\\mathrm{H}]^{+}$) has a mass of $m_{\\mathrm{I}}$ and a charge number $z$. Since the analyte is singly protonated, $z=1$. Its initial mass-to-charge ratio is $m_{\\mathrm{I}}/1$.\n\nIon-neutral clustering involves the association of one or more neutral molecules, $\\mathrm{N}$, with the ion:\n$$ \\mathrm{I}^{+} + k\\mathrm{N} \\rightarrow [\\mathrm{I} \\cdot (k\\mathrm{N})]^{+} $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of neutral molecules adducted. Each neutral molecule has a mass $m_{\\mathrm{N}}$.\n\nThe resulting cluster ion, $[\\mathrm{I} \\cdot (k\\mathrm{N})]^{+}$, has a new mass $m_{\\text{cluster}} = m_{\\mathrm{I}} + k \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{N}}$. The charge of the complex remains $z=1$, as only neutral species are added. The new mass-to-charge ratio is $(m_{\\mathrm{I}} + k \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{N}})/1$.\n\nThe observed shift in the mass-to-charge ratio, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is:\n$$ \\Delta(m/z) = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{I}} + k \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{N}}}{z} - \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{I}}}{z} = \\frac{k \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{N}}}{z} $$\nFor $z=1$, this simplifies to $\\Delta(m/z) = k \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{N}}$. The observed separations of $18\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ and $32\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ correspond to the masses of common neutral atmospheric species, likely water ($\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$) and molecular oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}_2$), respectively.\n\n**2. Analysis of Competing Processes**\n\nTo solve the problem, we must find conditions ($T$, $P$) that minimize clustering while satisfying the constraint of minimal thermal decomposition.\n\n**A. Ion-Neutral Clustering:**\n\nClustering is an equilibrium process, $\\mathrm{I}^{+} + \\mathrm{N} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{I}\\cdot \\mathrm{N}^{+}$. The extent of clustering depends on the concentration of neutrals and the stability of the cluster. The problem states the propensity scales with the product $n \\cdot K(T)$.\n\n- **Dependence on Pressure ($P$) and Temperature ($T$) via Number Density ($n$):**\n  From the ideal gas law, the number density of neutral molecules is $n = P/(k_B T)$. To reduce clustering, one must reduce $n$. This is achieved by **decreasing the pressure $P$** and/or **increasing the temperature $T$**.\n\n- **Dependence on Temperature ($T$) via Equilibrium Constant ($K(T)$):**\n  The equilibrium constant is $K(T) = \\exp(-\\Delta G(T)/(RT)) = \\exp(-(\\Delta H - T\\Delta S)/(RT)) = \\exp(-\\Delta H/(RT)) \\exp(\\Delta S/R)$.\n  Given $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = -40\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}  0$ (exothermic), the term $-\\Delta H/(RT)$ is positive. As temperature $T$ increases, $1/T$ decreases, so $-\\Delta H/(RT)$ decreases, and $\\exp(-\\Delta H/(RT))$ decreases. Thus, $K(T)$ decreases as $T$ increases. This follows Le Chatelier's principle: increasing the temperature of an exothermic reaction shifts the equilibrium toward the reactants (de-clustering). So, to reduce clustering, one must **increase the temperature $T$**.\n\n- **Conclusion for Clustering:** To minimize cluster formation, one should use the **highest possible temperature $T$** and the **lowest possible pressure $P$**.\n\n**B. Thermal Decomposition:**\n\nDecomposition is a kinetic process governed by the Arrhenius rate law, $k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}(T) = A \\exp(-E_{a}/(RT))$, for a labile analyte. The extent of decomposition during the residence time $\\tau$ is given by the product $k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}(T)\\,\\tau$.\n\n- **Dependence on Temperature ($T$):**\n  The activation energy $E_a$ is positive ($140\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$). As temperature $T$ increases, the term $-E_a/(RT)$ becomes less negative, causing the exponential term, and thus $k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}(T)$, to increase dramatically.\n\n- **Constraint:** To protect the labile analyte, we must satisfy $k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}(T)\\,\\tau \\ll 1$. This imposes an upper limit on the acceptable operating temperature.\n\n**C. The Optimization Compromise:**\n\nWe have a conflict: high $T$ is good for minimizing clustering, but bad for analyte stability. Low $P$ is always good for minimizing clustering. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to use the **lowest feasible pressure $P$** and the **highest temperature $T$ that does not cause appreciable decomposition**.\n\n**3. Quantitative Evaluation of Options**\n\nWe must evaluate the dimensionless quantity $k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}(T)\\,\\tau$ for the temperatures proposed in the options. We use $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J/mol\\cdot K}$, $A = 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $\\tau = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $E_a = 140000\\,\\mathrm{J/mol}$.\nThe quantity to calculate is $k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}(T)\\,\\tau = (5 \\times 10^{10}) \\exp(-140000 / (8.314 \\cdot T)) = (5 \\times 10^{10}) \\exp(-16839/T)$, with $T$ in Kelvin.\n\nWe also evaluate a proportional measure of clustering propensity, $F(T,P) \\propto n \\cdot K(T) \\propto (P/T) \\cdot \\exp(-\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}} / (RT))$.\nUsing $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = -40000\\,\\mathrm{J/mol}$, this becomes $F(T,P) \\propto (P/T) \\exp(40000 / (8.314 \\cdot T)) \\propto (P/T) \\exp(4811/T)$. We seek to minimize this value.\n\nThe analysis for each option is summarized below:\n\n| Option | $T$ ($K$) | $P$ (Torr) | $k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}\\tau$ (Decomposition) | $F(T,P)$ (Clustering Propensity) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A | $120\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 393.15$ | $5.0$ | $(5 \\times 10^{10}) \\exp(-42.83) \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{-8}$ | $\\propto 2630$ |\n| B | $240\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 513.15$ | $0.8$ | $(5 \\times 10^{10}) \\exp(-32.81) \\approx 2.8 \\times 10^{-4}$ | $\\propto 18.2$ |\n| C | $80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 353.15$  | $0.5$ | $(5 \\times 10^{10}) \\exp(-47.68) \\approx 7.2 \\times 10^{-11}$| $\\propto 1167$ |\n| D | $320\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 593.15$ | $0.2$ | $(5 \\times 10^{10}) \\exp(-28.39) \\approx 0.023$ | $\\propto 1.12$ |\n\n- Option A has negligible decomposition but an extremely high clustering propensity due to the very high pressure.\n- Option C has negligible decomposition but a high clustering propensity. The low temperature is insufficient to break clusters effectively, even at low pressure.\n- Option D has the lowest clustering propensity but results in ~$2.3\\%$ decomposition ($0.023$). For a \"labile\" analyte, this may be considered significant and is nearly $100$ times greater than the decomposition in Option B.\n- Option B provides a massive reduction in clustering propensity (a factor of ~$140$ better than A, ~$60$ better than C) while maintaining a truly negligible level of decomposition ($2.8 \\times 10^{-4}$ or $0.028\\%$). This represents the best balance between the competing requirements.\n\n### Evaluation of Provided Options\n\n**A. Ion-neutral clustering adds one or more neutral molecules of mass $m_{\\mathrm{N}}$ to $\\mathrm{I}^{+}$, increasing the observed $m/z$ by $\\Delta(m/z) = k\\,m_{\\mathrm{N}}/z$ for $k$ neutrals; clustering is suppressed primarily by lowering ion speed, so use $T = 120\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $P = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{Torr}$ to reduce collision energy and preserve labile ions.**\nThe explanation for the $m/z$ shift is correct. However, the reasoning for suppressing clustering is flawed. Lowering temperature reduces collision energy and ion speed but *increases* the equilibrium constant for exothermic association, thus promoting clustering. Furthermore, the proposed pressure of $5.0\\,\\mathrm{Torr}$ is the highest among the options and would strongly favor clustering. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Ion-neutral clustering adds neutral mass so the observed $m/z$ increases by $\\Delta(m/z) = k\\,m_{\\mathrm{N}}/z$ for $k$ neutrals; clustering propensity scales with $K(T)\\,n$ where $K(T)$ decreases as $T$ increases and $n$ decreases with lower $P$ and higher $T$, while decomposition risk follows Arrhenius kinetics. Choose $T = 240\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $P = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{Torr}$ to reduce $K(T)\\,n$ without making $k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}(T)\\,\\tau$ appreciable.**\nThe mechanistic explanation is entirely correct. It accurately describes the dependencies of clustering on both temperature and pressure ($K(T)$ and $n$) and correctly identifies the Arrhenius behavior of decomposition. The proposed parameters, $T = 240\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $P = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{Torr}$, are shown by quantitative analysis to be an excellent compromise, drastically reducing clustering while keeping decomposition negligible. **Correct**.\n\n**C. Ion-neutral clustering increases $m/z$ and is dominated by the frequency of collisions, which is minimized by reducing $P$ even if $T$ is kept low to protect labile analytes; use $T = 80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $P = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{Torr}$.**\nThis option correctly identifies that reducing pressure helps, but it incorrectly downplays the strong effect of temperature on the clustering equilibrium. Keeping the temperature low ($80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) severely limits the ability to break up clusters via shifting the equilibrium, resulting in a suboptimal outcome for declustering, as shown by the high calculated propensity. The proposed settings are not the best choice. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Ion-neutral clustering increases $m/z$ via neutral adduction; the most effective suppression demands the highest feasible $T$ and lowest $P$ regardless of analyte lability; set $T = 320\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $P = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{Torr}$.**\nWhile these settings are indeed the most effective for suppressing clustering, the statement \"regardless of analyte lability\" directly contradicts the problem's constraint to avoid decomposition of a \"labile\" analyte. The calculation shows that at $T = 320\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, thermal decomposition becomes non-negligible ($k_{\\mathrm{decomp}}(T)\\,\\tau \\approx 0.023$). This choice fails to respect the required balance and risks degrading the analyte. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3718497"}, {"introduction": "Once ions enter the mass analyzer, their mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) must be determined accurately.

To account for non-idealities of ion formation and extraction (e.g., finite plasma pulse duration and extraction delays), laboratories routinely calibrate the time scale to mass-to-charge ratio using an empirical linear model in the square root domain. \n\nAssume the empirical calibration relation has the form $t=a\\sqrt{m/z}+b$, where $t$ is the measured arrival time, $m/z$ is the mass-to-charge ratio, and $a$ and $b$ are constants determined by calibration. Starting from the principle that an ion accelerated through an extraction potential acquires kinetic energy equal to the charge times the potential drop, and that the flight time over a fixed drift length is the drift length divided by the ion velocity, derive the form of a linear dependence of $t$ on $\\sqrt{m/z}$ and explain the physical interpretation of $a$ and $b$ in this context. Then, using two calibrant ions measured in the same plasma desorption ionization experiment at $m/z=100$ with $t=7.00\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$ and $m/z=400$ with $t=14.00\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$, determine the numerical values of $a$ and $b$. Finally, use the calibrated relation to predict the time-of-flight $t$ for an ion with $m/z=250$.\n\nReport $a$, $b$, and the predicted $t$ as numerical values in microseconds. Round all reported values to four significant figures. Provide the final answer as a single row matrix in the order $\\big(a,\\ b,\\ t|_{m/z=250}\\big)$.", "solution": "The problem requires a three-part response: first, a derivation of the time-of-flight equation and physical interpretation of the calibration constants; second, the calculation of these constants from given data; and third, the prediction of a flight time for a new ion.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Interpretation\n\nWe begin from the stated physical principles. An ion of mass $m$ and charge $q$ is accelerated by a uniform extraction potential $V$. The potential energy lost by the ion in the electric field is converted into kinetic energy, $E_K$.\n$$E_K = qV$$\nThe charge $q$ is an integer multiple of the elementary charge $e$, so $q=ze$, where $z$ is the charge number.\n$$E_K = zeV$$\nThe kinetic energy is also given by the classical expression $E_K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the final velocity of the ion upon exiting the acceleration region.\nEquating the two expressions for kinetic energy gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = zeV$$\nSolving for the velocity $v$:\n$$v^2 = \\frac{2zeV}{m}$$\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2zeV}{m}}$$\nAfter acceleration, the ion enters a field-free drift region of fixed length $L$. The time taken to traverse this region, known as the flight time $t_{flight}$, is given by the distance divided by the constant velocity:\n$$t_{flight} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v$:\n$$t_{flight} = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2zeV}{m}}} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2zeV}}$$\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, denoted as $m/z$ in the problem statement, is the ratio of the ion's mass to its charge number. Let's express the flight time in terms of this quantity.\n$$t_{flight} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2eV}} \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{z}}$$\nIn mass spectrometry, the quantity $m/z$ refers to the mass in atomic mass units (Da), let us call it $M$, divided by the charge number $z$. The mass in kilograms, $m$, is related to $M$ by the atomic mass unit constant, $u$, where $m = M u$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$t_{flight} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{u}{2eV}} \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{z}}$$\nSince the problem uses the notation $m/z$ for the ratio $M/z$, we will adopt it. The equation has the form:\n$$t_{flight} = \\left( L \\sqrt{\\frac{u}{2eV}} \\right) \\sqrt{m/z}$$\nThis is a linear relationship between the ideal flight time $t_{flight}$ and $\\sqrt{m/z}$.\n\nThe problem provides an empirical calibration relation, $t = a\\sqrt{m/z} + b$, where $t$ is the total measured arrival time. The ideal model derived above does not account for non-idealities. The total measured time $t$ is the sum of the ideal flight time in the drift tube, $t_{flight}$, and any time delays, $t_{delay}$, that are independent of the mass-to-charge ratio.\n$$t = t_{flight} + t_{delay}$$\nBy comparing our derived physical model with the empirical relation:\n$$t = \\left( L \\sqrt{\\frac{u}{2eV}} \\right) \\sqrt{m/z} + t_{delay} \\quad \\equiv \\quad t = a\\sqrt{m/z} + b$$\nWe can now interpret the constants $a$ and $b$:\nThe constant $a = L \\sqrt{\\frac{u}{2eV}}$ is the slope of the calibration curve when plotting $t$ versus $\\sqrt{m/z}$. It is a function of the fixed instrument parameters: the length of the drift tube ($L$) and the extraction potential ($V$).\nThe constant $b = t_{delay}$ is the time-axis intercept. It represents a constant time offset that is independent of the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. This offset accounts for various experimental non-idealities, such as the finite duration of the plasma pulse, delays in the ion extraction process, time spent by the ion in the acceleration region (as an approximation), and electronic delays in the detection system.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Calibration Constants\n\nWe are given two data points from a calibration experiment:\n1. For $(m/z)_1 = 100$, the measured time is $t_1 = 7.00 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n2. For $(m/z)_2 = 400$, the measured time is $t_2 = 14.00 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the linear calibration equation $t = a\\sqrt{m/z} + b$ to form a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $a$ and $b$. Let time be in units of $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nEquation 1:\n$$7.00 = a\\sqrt{100} + b \\implies 7.00 = 10a + b$$\nEquation 2:\n$$14.00 = a\\sqrt{400} + b \\implies 14.00 = 20a + b$$\n\nTo solve for an $a$, we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n$$(14.00 - 7.00) = (20a - 10a) + (b - b)$$\n$$7.00 = 10a$$\n$$a = \\frac{7.00}{10} = 0.700$$\nThe units of $a$ are $\\mu\\mathrm{s} / \\sqrt{m/z}$.\n\nNow, substitute the value of $a$ back into Equation 1 to find $b$:\n$$7.00 = 10(0.700) + b$$\n$$7.00 = 7.00 + b$$\n$$b = 0.00$$\nThe unit of $b$ is $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe problem requires reporting these values rounded to four significant figures.\n$$a = 0.7000$$\n$$b = 0.0000$$\n\nPart 3: Prediction of Time-of-Flight\n\nThe calibrated relationship is now determined:\n$$t = 0.7000\\sqrt{m/z} + 0.0000$$\nWe use this equation to predict the time-of-flight $t$ for an ion with $m/z = 250$.\n$$t = 0.7000\\sqrt{250}$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\\sqrt{250} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 10} = 5\\sqrt{10} \\approx 5 \\times 3.16227766 \\approx 15.8113883$$\n$$t \\approx 0.7000 \\times 15.8113883 \\approx 11.0679718$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as required:\n$$t \\approx 11.07$$\nThe unit of the predicted time is $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe final requested values are $a = 0.7000$, $b = 0.0000$, and the predicted time for $m/z=250$, $t = 11.07$. These are to be reported in a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.7000  0.0000  11.07 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3718475"}]}
