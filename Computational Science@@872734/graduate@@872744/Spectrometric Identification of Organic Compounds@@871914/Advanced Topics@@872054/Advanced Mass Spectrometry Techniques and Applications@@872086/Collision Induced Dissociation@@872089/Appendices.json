The lab-frame kinetic energy is given by the fundamental relation that a charge accelerated through a potential difference gains kinetic energy equal to the product of the charge and the potential difference. In symbols, an ion of charge $z$ accelerated through a potential $V$ gains lab-frame kinetic energy $E_{\\mathrm{lab}} = z e V$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $V$ is in volts; equivalently, $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$ in electronvolts (eV) is $E_{\\mathrm{lab}} = z V$ when $V$ is in volts.

This violates the priority of minimizing interference.\n-   **Fragmentation:** The energy is stepped between $20~\\mathrm{eV}$ (insufficient) and $30~\\mathrm{eV}$ (sufficient). The overall fragmentation yield is an average of the yields at these two energies. Since the condition is a \"$\\ge 50\\%$ primary fragmentation yield\" and the $20~\\mathrm{eV}$ step will produce a yield well below this, the time-averaged yield is likely to fall below the $50\\%$ threshold.
