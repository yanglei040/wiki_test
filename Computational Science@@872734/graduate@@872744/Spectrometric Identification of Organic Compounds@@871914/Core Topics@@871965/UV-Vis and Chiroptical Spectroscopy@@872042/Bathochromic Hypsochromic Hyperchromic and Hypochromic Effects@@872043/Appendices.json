The observed bathochromic shift is consistent with the stated hypothesis of increased $\\pi$-conjugation. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nTo determine the change in transition energy, $\\Delta E$, we begin with the Planck-Einstein relation, which connects the energy of a photon, $E$, to its wavelength, $\\lambda$:\n$$E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe energies corresponding to the absorption maxima at wavelengths $\\lambda_1 = 280\\ \\text{nm}$ and $\\lambda_2 = 310\\ \\text{nm}$ are given by:\n$$E_1 = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_1}$$\n$$E_2 = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_2}$$\n\nThe problem defines the change in transition energy as $\\Delta E = E(310\\ \\text{nm}) - E(280\\ \\text{nm})$, which corresponds to $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$.

The primary UV-Vis absorption in conjugated organic molecules is due to the electronic transition from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) to the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), specifically a $\\pi \\to \\pi^{*}$ transition. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap between these two orbitals, $\\Delta E_{\\text{gap}} = E_{\\text{LUMO}} - E_{\\text{HOMO}}$.\n\nAccording to MO theory, increasing the extent of $\\pi$-conjugation in a molecule (i.e., increasing the number of alternating single and multiple bonds in a chain or ring) leads to the formation of more $\\pi$ molecular orbitals that are spread out over a smaller energy range. This has two key effects: the energy of the HOMO is raised, and the energy of the LUMO is lowered. Consequently, the energy gap, $\\Delta E_{\\text{gap}}$, between the HOMO and LUMO decreases.\n\nSince the transition energy is equal to this gap ($E_{\\text{transition}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{gap}} = hc/\\lambda$), a smaller energy gap results in the absorption of light with lower energy, and therefore, a longer wavelength. This shift to a longer wavelength is termed a bathochromic shift or a \"red shift.\"\n\nThe problem states that the absorptionmaximum shifts from $\\lambda_1 = 280\\ \\text{nm}$ to a longer wavelength $\\lambda_2 = 310\\ \\text{nm}$, which is a bathochromic shift. Our calculation of the energy change, $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \\approx -0.4285\\ \\text{eV}$, confirms that the transition energy has decreased ($E_2 < E_1$). The negative sign of $\\Delta E$ directly quantifies this decrease in energy. Both the qualitative observation (bathochromic shift) and the quantitative result (negative $\\Delta E$) are fully consistent with the prediction of MO theory for an increase in $\\pi$-conjugation. The magnitude of the change, approximately $0.43\\ \\text{eV}$, is a typical value for such structural modifications, further supporting that the nature of the transition remains $\\pi \\to \\pi^{*}$ and has not changed to a different electronic transition type.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.4285}$$", "id": "3694270"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the position of an absorption band, its intensity—quantified by the molar absorptivity ($\\epsilon$)—provides crucial information about the electronic transition.

To express this with three significant figures, we write:\n$$H_f = -0.200$$\nThe negative sign indicates a decrease in molar absorptivity, which is the definition of a hypochromic effect.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a qualitative justification for how such a hypochromic effect can arise without an accompanying measurable shift in the absorption maximum, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\nFrom first principles of quantum mechanics and spectroscopy, the intensity of an absorption band, related to the molar absorptivity $\\epsilon$, is proportional to the transition probability. For an electric dipole transition, this probability is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment, $|\\vec{\\mu}_{fi}|^2$, where $\\vec{\\mu}_{fi} = \\langle \\psi_f | \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} | \\psi_i \\rangle$. Here, $\\psi_i$ and $\\psi_f$ are the wavefunctions of the initial (ground) and final (excited) electronic states, respectively, and $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}$ is the electric dipole moment operator.\nThe position of the absorption maximum, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$, is determined by the energy difference, $\\Delta E$, between the two states, according to the relation $\\Delta E = h\\nu = hc/\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\nA hypochromic effect is a decrease in $\\epsilon$, corresponding to a decrease in $|\\vec{\\mu}_{fi}|^2$. The absence of a shift in $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ implies that $\\Delta E$ remains essentially unchanged. The task is to identify mechanisms that can significantly alter $|\\vec{\\mu}_{fi}|^2$ while only minimally perturbing $\\Delta E$.\n\nTwo plausible mechanistic origins are:\n\n1.  **Exciton Coupling in specific geometries**: When two or more chromophores are in close proximity, their transition dipole moments can interact, a phenomenon described by exciton theory. This coupling causes the excited state of the individual monomer to split into a set of exciton states for the aggregate. The total oscillator strength (integrated intensity) is conserved but redistributed among the new exciton transitions. For a stacked, parallel arrangement of chromophores (an H-aggregate), the vector coupling of the transition dipoles leads to a scenario where the lowest-energy transition becomes formally forbidden ($\\vec{\\mu}_{fi} \\approx 0$), while a higher-energy transition becomes strongly allowed. This results in a strong hypochromic effect on the lowest-energy absorption band. While the simplest model predicts a concurrent hypsochromic (blue) shift to the higher-energy allowed band, in many real systems, such as the stacked base pairs in a DNA double helix, the geometry is more complex and less ideal. The resulting coupling can lead to a substantial decrease in the molar absorptivity (hypochromism) with only a very small, often experimentally unmeasurable, shift in $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n2.  **Intramolecular Conformational Change**: The magnitude of the transition dipole moment integral, $\\langle \\psi_f | \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} | \\psi_i \\rangle$, is highly sensitive to the spatial overlap and symmetry of the initial and final state wavefunctions, which are in turn dependent on the molecular geometry. For a planar conjugated chromophore, the $\\pi$-orbitals have maximal overlap. A perturbation that induces a minor conformational change, such as a slight twisting around a single bond, can reduce the planarity of the system. This distortion decreases the extent of $\\pi$-conjugation and alters the orbital overlap, thereby reducing the magnitude of the transition dipole moment. This leads to a decrease in transition probability and a corresponding hypochromic effect. Because the change in geometry is subtle, its effect on the energies of the molecular orbitals ($E_i$ and $E_f$) can be very small, leading to a negligible change in the transition energy $\\Delta E$ and thus no measurable shift in $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nBoth mechanisms provide a pathway for decoupling the intensity of an absorption band from its energy, explaining the observation of a hypochromic effect without a significant spectral shift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.200}$$", "id": "3694333"}, {"introduction": "The solvent environment can profoundly influence a chromophore's absorption spectrum, a phenomenon known as solvatochromism.

The problem asks for the numerical value of $d$ rounded to four significant figures, which is $40.00$.\n\nThe problem also requires an interpretation of the signs of the coefficients $b, c,$ and $d$. A positive coefficient means that an increase in the corresponding solvent parameter causes an increase in $\\lambda_{\\max}$ (a bathochromic or \"red\" shift), while a negative coefficient implies a decrease in $\\lambda_{\\max}$ (a hypsochromic or \"blue\" shift). The energy of the electronic transition is given by $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda_{\\max}$, so a bathochromic shift corresponds to a decrease in transition energy, and a hypsochromic shift corresponds to an increase in transition energy.\n\n1.  **Hydrogen-bond donating acidity ($\\alpha$):** The coefficient is $b = -15$. The negative sign indicates that increasing the solvent's H-bond donating capability leads to a **hypsochromic shift** ($\\lambda_{\\max}$ decreases). This means the transition energy $\\Delta E$ increases. For $\\Delta E = E_{\\text{excited}} - E_{\\text{ground}}$ to increase, the solvent must stabilize the ground state more than the excited state. This occurs when the dye molecule is a stronger hydrogen-bond acceptor in its ground state than in its excited state. The H-bond donating solvent preferentially stabilizes the ground state, widening the energy gap to the excited state. This is characteristic of $n \\to \\pi^{\\ast}$ transitions.\n\n2.  **Hydrogen-bond accepting basicity ($\\beta$):** The coefficient is $c = 10$. The positive sign indicates that increasing the solvent's H-bond accepting capability leads to a **bathochromic shift** ($\\lambda_{\\max}$ increases). This means the transition energy $\\Delta E$ decreases. An H-bond accepting solvent stabilizes a dye that is an H-bond donor. For $\\Delta E$ to decrease, the excited state must be stabilized more than the ground state. This happens if the dye becomes a stronger acid (better H-bond donor) upon electronic excitation, leading to a stronger interaction with the basic solvent in the excited state.\n\n3.  **Dipolarity/Polarizability ($\\pi^{\\ast}$):** The coefficient is $d = 40$. The positive sign indicates that increasing the solvent's dipolarity/polarizability leads to a **bathochromic shift** ($\\lambda_{\\max}$ increases). This implies a decrease in the transition energy $\\Delta E$. This is a very common type of solvatochromism, known as positive solvatochromism. It occurs when the excited state of the dye is more polar (has a larger dipole moment) than the ground state. A more polar solvent will provide greater stabilization to the more polar excited state through dipole-dipole interactions, thereby reducing the energy gap $\\Delta E$ from the less polar ground state. This is typical for many $\\pi \\to \\pi^{\\ast}$ transitions.\n\nThe value of the coefficient $d$ requested in the problem is $40$. Expressed to four significant figures, this is $40.00$.
