Therefore, we can set the force constants to be equal: $k_{\\text{C–H}} = k_{\\text{C–D}} = k$.\n\nWith this assumption, we can derive the analytical expression for the ratio of the two wavenumbers by dividing the equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{C–H}}$ by that for $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{C–D}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{C–H}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{C–D}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\text{C–H}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\text{C–D}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k/\\mu_{\\text{C–H}}}{k/\\mu_{\\text{C–D}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\text{C–D}}}{\\mu_{\\text{C–H}}}}\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression relating the ratio of the stretching wavenumbers to the square root of the inverse ratio of their reduced masses.\n\nNext, we proceed to the numerical calculation.

This process involves four sequential steps as outlined in the problem.\n\nFirst, we establish the basis for the analysis. The $\\mathrm{C_{3v}}$ point group contains three classes of symmetry operations: the identity operation ($E$), two rotations by $\\pm \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians about the principal axis ($2C_3$), and three vertical reflection planes ($3\\sigma_v$). The total number of operations, which is the order of the group, is $h = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$. The basis for our representation is the set of three vectors representing the C–H bond stretches, denoted $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$.\n\nThe first step is to construct the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$, for this basis set. This is achieved by calculating the character, $\\chi(R)$, for a representative operation $R$ from each class. The character is defined as the number of basis vectors that remain invariant (i.e., are mapped onto themselves) under the operation.\n\n1.  **Identity Operation ($E$):** The identity operation leaves all three bond-stretching vectors $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$ unchanged. Therefore, the character is $\\chi(E) = 3$.\n\n2.  **Rotation Operation ($C_3$):** A rotation about the $C_3$ axis, which passes through the carbon atom and is perpendicular to the plane of the three hydrogen atoms, permutes all three hydrogen atoms and thus all three C–H bond vectors. No vector is left in its original position. Consequently, the character is $\\chi(C_3) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Reflection Operation ($\\sigma_v$):** Each vertical mirror plane $\\sigma_v$ by definition contains the principal $C_3$ axis and one of the C–H bonds. The C–H bond vector lying within the plane remains unchanged, while the other two C–H bond vectors are interchanged by the reflection. Thus, exactly one basis vector is left invariant by any $\\sigma_v$ operation. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\n\nThe set of characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ is therefore $(\\chi(E), \\chi(2C_3), \\chi(3\\sigma_v)) = (3, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe second step is to decompose $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ into its constituent irreducible representations (irreps) of the $\\mathrm{C_{3v}}$ point group. We use the standard reduction formula:\n$$n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g_R \\cdot \\chi_i(R) \\cdot \\chi_{\\text{red}}(R)$$\nwhere $n_i$ is the number of times the irrep $i$ is present, $h$ is the order of the group, $g_R$ is the number of operations in the class of $R$, $\\chi_i(R)$ is the character of the irrep $i$, and $\\chi_{\\text{red}}(R)$ is the character from $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$.

This result indicates that the three C–H stretching motions combine to produce two normal modes: a non-degenerate mode with $A_1$ symmetry (the symmetric stretch) and a doubly-degenerate mode with $E$ symmetry (the asymmetric stretches).\n\nThe third step is to determine which of these normal modes are IR active. A vibrational mode is IR active if it transforms with the same symmetry as one of the Cartesian components of the electric dipole moment, i.e., as one of the coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$. From the character table for $\\mathrm{C_{3v}}$:\n- The coordinate $z$ transforms as the $A_1$ irreducible representation.\n- The coordinates $(x, y)$ transform as a degenerate pair, corresponding to the $E$ irreducible representation.\n\nOur calculated vibrational modes have symmetries $A_1$ and $E$.\n- The mode with $A_1$ symmetry is IR active because it has the same symmetry as the $z$ coordinate.\n- The mode with $E$ symmetry is IR active because it has the same symmetry as the $(x, y)$ coordinate pair.\n\nFinally, we compute $N$, the total number of IR-active C–H stretching normal modes, counting each component of a degenerate mode separately.\n- The $A_1$ mode is non-degenerate (dimension $1$) and is IR active. It contributes $1$ mode.\n- The $E$ mode is doubly-degenerate (dimension $2$) and is IR active. It contributes $2$ modes.\n\nThe total number of IR-active modes is the sum of these contributions:\n$N = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nAll three C–H stretching vibrations are predicted to be IR active.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3694606"}]}
