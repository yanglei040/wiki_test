Extracted Givens:**\n*   **Compounds:** Acetophenone (phenyl methyl ketone), benzophenone (diphenyl ketone), and para-nitroacetophenone (para-nitrophenyl methyl ketone).\n*   **Conditions:** Dilute non-hydrogen-bonding solution, identical recording conditions.\n*   **Model:** Carbonyl group treated as an isolated diatomic oscillator localized on the carbon and oxygen atoms.\n*   **Assumptions:**\n    *   Fermi resonances or strong coupling to other normal modes are negligible.\n    *   Changes in effective reduced mass ($\\mu$) are small compared to changes in the effective force constant ($k$).\n\n**2. Validation Analysis:**\n*   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly rooted in the fundamental principles of physical organic chemistry and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The relationship between bond strength, force constant, and vibrational frequency is a core concept. The analysis of substituent effects (conjugation, electronic withdrawal/donation) on molecular properties is standard.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It specifies the compounds and the physical property to be compared. The explicit assumptions (negligible mass effects and coupling) provide a clear and tractable theoretical framework, ensuring a unique solution based on the interplay of electronic effects.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, scientific language. Terms like \"carbonyl stretching absorption,\" \"force constant,\" and \"conjugation\" have well-defined meanings.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or fatal flaws. It is a valid problem that can be solved from first principles.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Correct Order\n\nThe vibrational stretching frequency of a chemical bond, when approximated as a harmonic oscillator, is related to the bond's force constant ($k$) and the reduced mass ($\\mu$) of the atoms involved. In terms of wavenumber ($\\tilde{\\nu}$), this relationship is given by:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem explicitly states to assume that changes in the reduced mass ($\\mu$) are negligible compared to changes in the force constant ($k$). Therefore, the wavenumber is primarily determined by the force constant:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\sqrt{k} $$\nThe force constant ($k$) is a direct measure of the bond's stiffness, which correlates with bond order or bond strength. A higher bond order (more double-bond character) corresponds to a stronger, stiffer bond, a larger force constant, and thus a higher stretching wavenumber. Conversely, factors that decrease the bond order weaken the bond, decrease the force constant, and lower the stretching wavenumber.\n\nWe now analyze the electronic effects in each of the three ketones.\n\n1.  **Acetophenone (Phenyl Methyl Ketone):**\n    The carbonyl group is directly attached to a phenyl ring. The phenyl ring is a $\\pi$-electron donor via resonance. This conjugation delocalizes the $\\pi$-electrons of the carbonyl group, which can be represented by the following resonance contributor:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Ph-C(=O)-CH_3} \\longleftrightarrow \\mathrm{Ph^+=C(O^{-})-CH_3} $$\n    This resonance introduces partial single-bond character into the carbon-oxygen bond, decreasing its bond order compared to a non-conjugated ketone (e.g., acetone). This weakening of the bond results in a lower force constant $k$ and a lower wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ than for an aliphatic ketone. We will use acetophenone as our baseline reference.\n\n2.  **Benzophenone (Diphenyl Ketone):**\n    The carbonyl group is conjugated with two phenyl rings. Both rings can donate $\\pi$-electron density into the carbonyl group, leading to a more extensive delocalization than in acetophenone.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Ph-C(=O)-Ph} \\longleftrightarrow \\mathrm{Ph^+=C(O^{-})-Ph} \\longleftrightarrow \\mathrm{Ph-C(O^{-})=Ph^+} $$\n    This enhanced conjugation results in even greater single-bond character for the C=O bond compared to acetophenone. Therefore, the C=O bond in benzophenone is weaker than in acetophenone. This leads to a smaller force constant and a lower wavenumber.\n    $$ k(\\text{benzophenone}) < k(\\text{acetophenone}) \\implies \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{benzophenone}) < \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone}) $$\n    (Note: Steric effects may cause one phenyl ring to be twisted out of planarity with the carbonyl group, reducing its conjugation. However, the net conjugative effect of two rings is still greater than that of one, so the conclusion holds.)\n\n3.  **para-Nitroacetophenone (para-Nitrophenyl Methyl Ketone):**\n    This molecule is acetophenone with a strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group ($-NO_2$) at the para position of the phenyl ring. The nitro group is a potent $\\pi$-acceptor and inductively withdraws electron density. It strongly deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution and, crucially here, pulls electron density from the ring. This withdrawal of electron density from the phenyl ring reduces the ring's ability to act as a $\\pi$-donor to the carbonyl group. In other words, the nitro group suppresses the resonance donation from the ring into the carbonyl that was described for acetophenone.\n    Because this resonance is suppressed, the C=O bond retains more of its inherent double-bond character. It is stronger and stiffer than the C=O bond in unsubstituted acetophenone. This results in a larger force constant and a higher wavenumber.\n    $$ k(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone}) > k(\\text{acetophenone}) \\implies \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone}) $$\n\n**Conclusion on Ordering:**\nCombining the comparisons, we arrive at the following order of decreasing wavenumber:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{benzophenone}) $$\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{benzophenone})$ because increased $\\pi$-conjugation lowers the carbonyl bond force constant, with benzophenone experiencing the greatest conjugative delocalization into two aryl rings, while a para-nitro group on the ring withdraws $\\pi$-electron density and suppresses resonance donation from the ring into the carbonyl, increasing the effective bond order and force constant.**\n*   **Ordering:** The order is $\\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{benzophenone})$. This matches our derivation.\n*   **Rationale:** The explanation is physically sound and entirely consistent with our analysis. It correctly identifies that (1) increased conjugation in benzophenone weakens the C=O bond, lowering $\\tilde{\\nu}$, and (2) the electron-withdrawing nitro group suppresses conjugation from the ring, strengthening the C=O bond and raising $\\tilde{\\nu}$ relative to acetophenone.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{benzophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone})$ because two phenyl rings exert strong inductive withdrawal that increases the carbonyl force constant the most, with a para-nitro group exerting a weaker effect.**\n*   **Ordering:** The order is incorrect.\n*   **Rationale:** The rationale is fundamentally flawed. In aryl ketones, the $\\pi$-donating resonance effect of the phenyl ring is the dominant electronic factor affecting the carbonyl, not its inductive effect. Furthermore, the claim that two phenyl rings are more withdrawing than a single phenyl ring substituted with a para-nitro group is incorrect; the nitro group is an exceptionally strong electron-withdrawing group.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{benzophenone})$ because the methyl group provides minimal conjugation to the carbonyl, maximizing the carbonyl bond strength, whereas the para-nitro group introduces additional conjugation pathways that delocalize and weaken the carbonyl more than in acetophenone.**\n*   **Ordering:** The order is incorrect. It incorrectly places $\\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone})$ below $\\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone})$.\n*   **Rationale:** The rationale is incorrect. While the methyl group's electronic effect is small, the claim that the para-nitro group weakens the carbonyl bond more than in acetophenone is the opposite of the true effect. The nitro group's electron-withdrawing nature strengthens the C=O bond by inhibiting delocalization from the ring.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{para-nitroacetophenone}) \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{benzophenone}) > \\tilde{\\nu}(\\text{acetophenone})$ because the increased mass of aryl substitution lowers the reduced mass in the carbonyl stretching coordinate and dominates over conjugative effects, raising the frequency relative to acetophenone, while the para-nitro effect is largely remote and negligible on the carbonyl.**\n*   **Ordering:** The order is incorrect.\n*   **Rationale:** This rationale is flawed on multiple grounds. First, it directly contradicts the problem's explicit assumption that force constant effects dominate over mass effects. Second, its physics is wrong: an increase in mass of atoms attached to an oscillator typically *lowers* the frequency, not raises it. Third, the claim that \"increased mass of aryl substitution lowers the reduced mass\" is nonsensical for the localized C=O oscillator. Finally, the assertion that the para-nitro group's effect is negligible is factually incorrect; it is a very strong electronic substituent.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3709898"}, {"introduction": "In spectroscopic analysis, context is everything.

The relationship between bond strength (force constant), electronic effects (conjugation, inductive/resonance effects of substituents), and vibrational frequency is a cornerstone of this field.

The question asks for a specific mechanistic explanation and the identification of corroborating evidence, which can be uniquely determined from the provided information and background theory.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is objective and uses standard, unambiguous terminology from organic chemistry and spectroscopy.

The presence of the weak doublet at $2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is a strong clue, but the problem's framing correctly focuses on explaining the potential ambiguity of the carbonyl stretch *before* using the doublet as confirmation.\n    -   **Unrealistic Data:** The vibrational frequencies are well within plausible ranges for a para-substituted aromatic aldehyde. For instance, benzaldehyde has its $\\mathrm{C=O}$ stretch at $\\approx 1703\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and an electron-donating group would lower this value, making $1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ entirely feasible.\n    -   **Other Flaws:** The problem is not trivial, ill-posed, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe vibrational frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}$ of a bond (in wavenumbers, $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) is described by the harmonic oscillator model:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond (a measure of its stiffness or strength) and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two atoms in the bond. For a $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond, a higher force constant (stronger bond) results in a higher stretching frequency, while a lower force constant (weaker bond) results in a lower frequency.\n\n1.  **Baseline Frequencies and Electronic Effects:** In the absence of other effects, a saturated aliphatic aldehyde $\\mathrm{C=O}$ stretch appears at $\\approx 1740\\text{--}1720\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, while a saturated aliphatic ketone is slightly lower at $\\approx 1725\\text{--}1705\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This small difference is primarily electronic; the two alkyl groups of a ketone are more electron-donating than the single alkyl group and hydrogen of an aldehyde, slightly weakening the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ bond.\n\n2.  **Effect of Conjugation:** The problem states the compound is aromatic, meaning the carbonyl is conjugated with the aryl $\\pi$ system. This allows for resonance delocalization of electron density:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Ar-C(H)=O} \\longleftrightarrow \\mathrm{Ar^{+}=C(H)-O^{-}} $$\n    The resonance hybrid has a contribution from a structure with a $\\mathrm{C-O}$ single bond. This reduces the overall bond order of the carbonyl group, weakening it. Consequently, the force constant $k$ decreases, and the stretching frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is lowered significantly, typically by $25\\text{--}40\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This places the typical aryl aldehyde $\\mathrm{C=O}$ stretch in the range of $1710\\text{--}1685\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and the aryl ketone stretch in the range of $1690\\text{--}1670\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The observed value of $1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is in the region where these two ranges overlap.\n\n3.  **Effect of Para Substituent on an Aryl Aldehyde:**\n    -   An **electron-donating group (EDG)** at the para position (e.g., $-\\mathrm{OCH}_3$, $-\\mathrm{NR}_2$) pushes electron density into the ring, which can then be further delocalized onto the carbonyl oxygen. This enhances the contribution of the resonance structure with the $\\mathrm{C-O}$ single bond, further weakening the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ bond. This causes an additional decrease in the force constant $k$ and thus a further lowering of $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n    -   An **electron-withdrawing group (EWG)** at the para position (e.g., $-\\mathrm{NO}_2$) pulls electron density from the ring. This makes delocalization of ring electrons onto the carbonyl less favorable. The net effect is an increase in the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ bond order compared to the unsubstituted case, which increases $k$ and raises $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\n    Therefore, for an aryl aldehyde's stretching frequency to be shifted down to $1696\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (a value often seen for aryl ketones), it must be subject to both **conjugation** and the electronic influence of an **electron-donating para substituent**.\n\n4.  **Confirmatory Spectroscopic Features:**\n    -   **IR Spectroscopy:** Aldehydes possess a unique $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bond on the carbonyl carbon. The stretching vibration of this aldehydic proton ($\\mathrm{C_{sp^2}-H}$) gives rise to a characteristic signal. Due to Fermi resonance with the overtone of the aldehydic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bending vibration, this signal usually appears as a pair of weak to medium intensity bands, one near $2820\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and another near $2720\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The problem statement provides data for a weak doublet at $2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which is a definitive signature of an aldehyde. Ketones, which have the structure $\\mathrm{R-CO-R'}$, lack this specific $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bond and do not show this feature.\n    -   **$^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR Spectroscopy:** The aldehydic proton is highly deshielded due to the magnetic anisotropy of the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ bond and the electronegativity of oxygen. It appears as a very distinct resonance in the far downfield region of the spectrum, typically between $\\delta \\approx 9\\text{--}10\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This region is typically devoid of other signals, making this a highly diagnostic peak for an aldehyde.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

The resulting frequency range is correct. Furthermore, it correctly identifies the two most reliable confirmatory features: the aldehydic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ Fermi doublet in the IR (and at the correct positions) and the downfield aldehydic proton signal in the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum. This analysis is fully consistent with the provided data and established principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Electron-withdrawing substitution at the para position reduces electron density at the carbonyl, lowering the effective force constant and shifting an aldehyde carbonyl into the ketone range near $1705\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$; the assignment is best confirmed by the sharper line shape of the carbonyl band and the absence of any bands near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.**\nThis option is incorrect. An electron-withdrawing group *increases* the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ force constant and *raises* the vibrational frequency, contrary to what is stated. It also suggests confirmation by the *absence* of bands near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, directly contradicting the explicit data given in the problem statement ($2823\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $2721\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The dominant origin of the aldehyde versus ketone frequency difference is the reduced mass of the oscillator, which decreases substantially upon replacing an alkyl group with hydrogen and thus lowers the aldehyde frequency; consequently, an aldehyde can readily appear near $1700\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and the most definitive confirmation is a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR carbonyl resonance above $\\delta \\approx 220\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.**\nThis option presents multiple flaws. The dominant factor influencing the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ frequency is the electronic environment affecting the force constant $k$, not the reduced mass $\\mu$. A lower reduced mass would *increase*, not decrease, the frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$). Finally, a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR resonance above $\\delta \\approx 220\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is characteristic of ketones, not aldehydes (which are typically in the $\\delta \\approx 190\\text{--}205\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Conjugation with an aryl ring increases the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ force constant by enhancing $\\pi$ bonding, raising the aldehyde frequency into the $1750\\text{--}1780\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region; the identity should be confirmed by an intense overtone series in the $5600\\text{--}6000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ near-IR region rather than by features near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.**\nThis option is fundamentally wrong. Conjugation *lowers* the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ stretching frequency by decreasing the force constant, not increasing it. The suggested frequency range of $1750\\text{--}1780\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is incorrect for a conjugated aldehyde. It also incorrectly dismisses the highly diagnostic aldehydic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ stretching bands near $2800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Hyperconjugation from alkyl substituents in an aldehyde lowers the reduced mass more than in ketones and therefore shifts aldehyde bands down to $1680\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$; confirmation should rely primarily on the presence of a strong band at $2850\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ attributable to an aldehydic $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ stretch, since this feature is absent in ketones.**\nThis option contains several errors. The dominant electronic effect in an aromatic system is resonance, not hyperconjugation. Hyperconjugation is an electronic effect and does not alter the reduced mass.

The standard uncertainty of each absorbance measurement during calibration is $u(A_{i}) = 0.004$. A baseline offset is present due to residual scatter and window absorption; model this by an intercept in the calibration.\n\nAn unknown sample of the ketone is measured in the same cell and solvent, and its baseline-corrected absorbance at $1715\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is $A_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.725$ with standard uncertainty $u(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) = 0.003$. Using a least-squares calibration of absorbance versus concentration, estimate the ketone concentration in the unknown and propagate uncertainties from the calibration (including the correlation between slope and intercept) and the measurement of $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$ into the final concentration uncertainty.

Report only the concentration value as the final answer.", "solution": "The problem is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data and conditions for performing a quantitative analysis using linear regression and uncertainty propagation, based on the fundamental principles of absorption spectroscopy. Therefore, a full solution is provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the linear relationship between absorbance and concentration, followed by a quantitative analysis of an unknown sample using a least-squares calibration, including a full uncertainty propagation.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation, the Beer-Lambert law. The attenuation of a collimated beam of light through a homogeneous absorbing medium is described by the differential equation:\n$$ dI = -\\alpha I c \\, dx $$\nwhere $dI$ is the change in intensity $I$ over an infinitesimal path length $dx$, $c$ is the concentration of the absorber, and $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant characteristic of the absorbing species and the wavelength of light. Rearranging and integrating over the full path length $l$ of the sample cell gives:\n$$ \\int_{I_{0}}^{I} \\frac{dI}{I} = - \\int_{0}^{l} \\alpha c \\, dx $$\nAssuming a uniform concentration $c$ throughout the path length $l$, the integration yields:\n$$ \\ln(I) - \\ln(I_{0}) = -\\alpha c l $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I}\\right) = \\alpha c l $$\nThe problem defines the decadic absorbance $A$ as $A = \\log_{10}(I_0/I)$. The natural logarithm ($\\ln$) and decadic logarithm ($\\log_{10}$) are related by $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$. Substituting this relationship into the equation gives:\n$$ \\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I}\\right) = \\alpha c l $$\n$$ \\ln(10) A = \\alpha c l $$\n$$ A = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\ln(10)}\\right) c l $$\nDefining the molar absorptivity (or extinction coefficient) as $\\epsilon = \\alpha / \\ln(10)$, we arrive at the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$ A = \\epsilon l c $$\nThis equation predicts a linear relationship between absorbance $A$ and concentration $c$, with a slope of $\\epsilon l$ and an intercept of zero.\n\nThe problem states that a baseline offset exists, which is common due to factors like solvent absorption, cell window scattering, or instrumental effects. Therefore, the calibration model is modified to include an intercept term, $b$:\n$$ A_i = m c_i + b $$\nwhere $m$ is the slope (related to $\\epsilon l$) and $b$ is the absorbance offset.\n\nGiven that the uncertainties in the concentrations $c_i$ are negligible and the uncertainty in each absorbance measurement $A_i$ is constant ($u(A_i) = 0.004$), the most appropriate method to determine the parameters $m$ and $b$ is ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression. The OLS method minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical residuals. The best-fit parameters are given by:\n$$ m = \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = \\bar{A} - m \\bar{c} $$\nwhere $N$ is the number of calibration points, and we define:\n$$ \\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\quad \\quad \\bar{A} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i $$\n$$ S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (c_i - \\bar{c})^2 = \\sum c_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum c_i)^2}{N} $$\n$$ S_{xy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (c_i - \\bar{c})(A_i - \\bar{A}) = \\sum c_i A_i - \\frac{(\\sum c_i)(\\sum A_i)}{N} $$\n\nWe use the provided calibration data ($N=5$):\n$c_i$ ($\\mathrm{mol\\,L}^{-1}$): $\\{0.050, 0.100, 0.150, 0.200, 0.250\\}$\n$A_i$: $\\{0.211, 0.407, 0.613, 0.804, 1.015\\}$\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary sums:\n$$\\sum c_i = 0.050 + 0.100 + 0.150 + 0.200 + 0.250 = 0.750\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n$$\\sum A_i = 0.211 + 0.407 + 0.613 + 0.804 + 1.015 = 3.050$$\n$$\\sum c_i^2 = (0.050)^2 + (0.100)^2 + (0.150)^2 + (0.200)^2 + (0.250)^2 = 0.1375\\,\\mathrm{mol^2\\,L}^{-2}$$\n$$\\sum c_i A_i = (0.050)(0.211) + (0.100)(0.407) + (0.150)(0.613) + (0.200)(0.804) + (0.250)(1.015) = 0.55775\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the averages and sums of squares:\n$$\\bar{c} = \\frac{0.750}{5} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n$$\\bar{A} = \\frac{3.050}{5} = 0.610$$\n$$S_{xx} = 0.1375 - \\frac{(0.750)^2}{5} = 0.1375 - 0.1125 = 0.0250\\,\\mathrm{mol^2\\,L}^{-2}$$\n$$S_{xy} = 0.55775 - \\frac{(0.750)(3.050)}{5} = 0.55775 - 0.4575 = 0.10025\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n\nNow we can determine the slope $m$ and intercept $b$:\n$$m = \\frac{0.10025}{0.0250} = 4.01\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol}^{-1}$$\n$$b = 0.610 - (4.01)(0.150) = 0.610 - 0.6015 = 0.0085$$\nThe calibration equation is thus $A = (4.01)c + 0.0085$.\n\nFor the unknown sample with measured absorbance $A_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.725$, its concentration $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is found by inverting the calibration equation:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{u}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{u}} - b}{m} = \\frac{0.725 - 0.0085}{4.01} = \\frac{0.7165}{4.01} \\approx 0.178678\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\n\nTo determine the uncertainty in $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$, we must propagate the uncertainties from the absorbance measurement of the unknown, $u(A_{\\mathrm{u}})$, and from the calibration parameters $m$ and $b$. The concentration $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is a function of $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$, $m$, and $b$. The variance $u^2(c_{\\mathrm{u}})$ is given by the law of propagation of uncertainty. Since the measurement of $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is independent of the calibration process, there is no covariance between $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$ and the parameters $m$ and $b$. However, $m$ and $b$ are correlated.\nThe general expression for $c_{\\mathrm{u}} = (A_{\\mathrm{u}} - b)/m$ is:\n$$u^2(c_{\\mathrm{u}}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial A_{\\mathrm{u}}}\\right)^2 u^2(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial m}\\right)^2 u^2(m) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial b}\\right)^2 u^2(b) + 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{u}}}{\\partial b}\\right)\\mathrm{cov}(m,b)$$\nThis can be simplified into a standard form for inverse prediction from an OLS calibration. The total variance in $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is composed of the variance projected from the measurement of $A_{\\mathrm{u}}$ and the variance due to the uncertainty of the calibration line itself at that point. Let $\\sigma_A$ be the standard uncertainty of the calibration absorbance measurements, which is given as $\\sigma_A = u(A_i) = 0.004$. The variance of the predicted absorbance on the line for a given concentration $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is $\\sigma_A^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{u}}-\\bar{c})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right)$. The variance from the measurement of the unknown itself is $u^2(A_{\\mathrm{u}})$. These two sources of variance in absorbance are propagated to the concentration $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ by dividing by $m^2$:\n$$u^2(c_{\\mathrm{u}}) = \\frac{1}{m^2} \\left[ u^2(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) + \\sigma_A^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{u}}-\\bar{c})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right) \\right]$$\nWe are given $u(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) = 0.003$ and $\\sigma_A = 0.004$. We substitute the known values:\n$$m = 4.01 \\quad \\quad u^2(A_{\\mathrm{u}}) = (0.003)^2 = 9 \\times 10^{-6} \\quad \\quad \\sigma_A^2 = (0.004)^2 = 1.6 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n$$N = 5 \\quad \\quad c_{\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 0.178678 \\quad \\quad \\bar{c} = 0.150 \\quad \\quad S_{xx} = 0.0250$$\nFirst, calculate the term for the calibration uncertainty:\n$$\\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{u}}-\\bar{c})^2}{S_{xx}} = \\frac{(0.178678 - 0.150)^2}{0.0250} = \\frac{(0.028678)^2}{0.0250} \\approx \\frac{8.2243 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.0250} \\approx 0.032897$$\n$$\\sigma_A^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(c_{\\mathrm{u}}-\\bar{c})^2}{S_{xx}}\\right) = (1.6 \\times 10^{-5}) \\left(\\frac{1}{5} + 0.032897\\right) = (1.6 \\times 10^{-5}) (0.232897) \\approx 3.7264 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nNow, combine with the uncertainty from the unknown measurement:\n$$u^2(c_{\\mathrm{u}}) = \\frac{1}{(4.01)^2} [9 \\times 10^{-6} + 3.7264 \\times 10^{-6}] = \\frac{12.7264 \\times 10^{-6}}{16.0801} \\approx 7.9144 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol^2\\,L}^{-2}$$\nThe standard uncertainty in $c_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is the square root of this variance:\n$$u(c_{\\mathrm{u}}) = \\sqrt{7.9144 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 0.0008896\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L}^{-1}$$\nThe result for the concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.178678 \\pm 0.000890\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L}^{-1}$.
