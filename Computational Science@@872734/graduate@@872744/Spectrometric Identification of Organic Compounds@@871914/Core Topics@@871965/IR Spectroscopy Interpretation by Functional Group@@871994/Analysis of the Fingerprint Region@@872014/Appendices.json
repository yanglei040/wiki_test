The relationship between bond strength, force constant, and vibrational frequency is a fundamental concept. The use of a $\\mathrm{CF_3}$ group as a strong inductive electron-withdrawer is standard. The analysis of competing electronic effects (induction vs. back-donation/resonance) is a cornerstone of an advanced understanding of chemical bonding. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear chemical transformation and asks for a specific, predictable outcome based on established theory. The provided assumptions (gas phase to isolate molecules, minimal coupling to treat local modes, and constant reduced mass to focus the analysis on the electronic effect) are crucial for making the problem solvable at a conceptual level. They define a clear path to a unique solution.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, scientific language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid, as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The assumptions provided are reasonable for a qualitative analysis and serve to focus the question on the key chemical principles. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental stretching frequency of a bond, expressed in wavenumbers ($\\tilde{\\nu}$), can be modeled by the harmonic oscillator approximation:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond, $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the vibrating system, and $c$ is the speed of light. The problem explicitly directs us to assume that the reduced mass $\\mu$ is approximately unchanged for both the carbon–oxygen ($\\mathrm{C–O}$) and carbon–nitrogen ($\\mathrm{C–N}$) bonds upon substitution. Therefore, any change in the stretching frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is determined by the change in the bond's force constant $k$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\sqrt{k}\n$$\nA stronger bond will have a larger force constant $k$ and thus a higher stretching frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu}$), a phenomenon known as a blue shift. A weaker bond will have a smaller force constant and a lower frequency, a red shift. Our task is to determine how the $\\mathrm{CH_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CF_3}$ substitution affects the force constants of the $\\mathrm{CH_2\\!–\\!O}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_2\\!–\\!N}$ bonds.\n\nThe substitution of a methyl group ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$) with a trifluoromethyl group ($\\mathrm{CF_3}$) on the ethyl chain (i.e., $\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2\\!-}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{CF_3CH_2\\!-}$ ) introduces a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect (a $-I$ effect) due to the high electronegativity of the three fluorine atoms. This effect propagates through the $\\sigma$-bond framework.\n\nThere are two primary electronic effects to consider for the bond between the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group and the heteroatom (O or N):\n\n1.  **Inductive effect through the $\\sigma$-bond:** The $\\mathrm{CF_3}$ group withdraws electron density from the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ carbon, which in turn withdraws electron density from the entire $\\mathrm{CH_2\\!–\\!O}$ or $\\mathrm{CH_2\\!–\\!N}$ $\\sigma$-bond. This removal of electron density from the bonding orbital would weaken the bond, decrease the force constant $k$, and thus decrease the stretching frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\n2.  **Lone-pair back-donation (a resonance/hyperconjugative effect):** Both oxygen (in the ether) and nitrogen (in the amine) possess lone pairs of electrons. The strong inductive withdrawal by the $\\mathrm{CF_3}$ group makes the adjacent $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ carbon atom significantly more electron-deficient (electrophilic). This increased positive character on the carbon atom greatly enhances the ability of the heteroatom's lone pair to delocalize into the $\\mathrm{C–O}$ or $\\mathrm{C–N}$ antibonding orbital ($\\sigma^*$), or more simply, to form a partial $\\pi$-bond. This can be represented by resonance structures:\n    - For the ether: $\\mathrm{F_3C\\!-\\!CH_2\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!CH_3} \\longleftrightarrow \\mathrm{F_3C\\!-\\!{}^{\\ominus}CH_2\\!=\\!{}^{\\oplus}O\\!-\\!CH_3}$\n    - For the amine: $\\mathrm{F_3C\\!-\\!CH_2\\!-\\!N(CH_3)_2} \\longleftrightarrow \\mathrm{F_3C\\!-\\!{}^{\\ominus}CH_2\\!=\\!{}^{\\oplus}N(CH_3)_2}$\n    This back-donation increases the double-bond character of the $\\mathrm{C–O}$ and $\\mathrm{C–N}$ bonds. An increase in bond order strengthens the bond, increases the force constant $k$, and thus increases the stretching frequency $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nFor heteroatoms with available lone pairs adjacent to an electron-withdrawing system (an arrangement analogous to the anomeric effect), the lone-pair back-donation effect (effect $2$) is generally dominant over the simple inductive withdrawal through the $\\sigma$-bond (effect $1$). The stabilization gained from this delocalization is significant and leads to a net strengthening and shortening of the bond.\n\n**Analysis of the Ether Pair ($\\mathrm{CF_3CH_2\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!CH_3}$ vs. $\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!CH_3}$):**\nThe substitution introduces the strong electron-withdrawing $\\mathrm{CF_3}$ group. This enhances the back-donation from an oxygen lone pair into the $\\mathrm{CH_2\\!-\\!O}$ bond. Consequently, the partial double-bond character of the $\\mathrm{CH_2\\!-\\!O}$ bond increases. This strengthening of the bond leads to a larger force constant $k_{\\mathrm{CO}}$. Since $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\propto \\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{CO}}}$, the $\\mathrm{C–O}$ stretching frequency is predicted to increase.\n\n**Analysis of the Amine Pair ($\\mathrm{CF_3CH_2\\!-\\!N(CH_3)_2}$ vs. $\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2\\!-\\!N(CH_3)_2}$):**\nThe same logic applies. Nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, making its lone pair more available for donation. The inductive pull of the $\\mathrm{CF_3}$ group makes the adjacent $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ carbon electrophilic, strongly promoting back-donation from the nitrogen lone pair. This increases the double-bond character of the $\\mathrm{CH_2\\!-\\!N}$ bond, strengthening it and increasing its force constant $k_{\\mathrm{CN}}$. As $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{CN}} \\propto \\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{CN}}}$, the $\\mathrm{C–N}$ stretching frequency is also predicted to increase.\n\nTherefore, for both pairs, the substitution is expected to cause a blue shift (an increase in frequency) for the C-heteroatom bond stretch.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Both carbon–oxygen and carbon–nitrogen stretching frequencies increase (blue shift).**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derived conclusion. The dominant electronic effect in both systems is the enhancement of lone-pair back-donation from the heteroatom ($\\mathrm{O}$ or $\\mathrm{N}$) to the newly electron-deficient carbon atom. This increases the double-bond character, bond strength, and force constant for both the $\\mathrm{C–O}$ and $\\mathrm{C–N}$ bonds, leading to an increase in their respective stretching frequencies.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Carbon–oxygen stretching frequency increases, while carbon–nitrogen stretching frequency decreases.**\nThis option suggests that the back-donation effect dominates for oxygen, while the $\\sigma$-inductive weakening effect dominates for nitrogen. This is chemically inconsistent. Nitrogen is a better lone-pair donor than oxygen, so if the back-donation effect is strong enough to cause a frequency increase for the $\\mathrm{C–O}$ bond, it should be even more certain to do so for the $\\mathrm{C–N}$ bond.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Carbon–oxygen stretching frequency decreases, while carbon–nitrogen stretching frequency increases.**\nThis implies that the $\\sigma$-inductive weakening prevails for the $\\mathrm{C–O}$ bond, while back-donation prevails for the $\\mathrm{C–N}$ bond. While it is true that nitrogen is a better donor than oxygen, the back-donation effect is significant even for oxygen in such systems. It is highly unlikely that the net effect would be bond weakening for oxygen but strengthening for nitrogen; the direction of the change should be the same, even if the magnitude differs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both carbon–oxygen and carbon–nitrogen stretching frequencies decrease (red shift).**\nThis option suggests that for both bonds, the dominant effect is the inductive withdrawal of electron density from the $\\sigma$-bond, leading to bond weakening. This analysis is incomplete as it neglects the crucial and typically overriding effect of lone-pair back-donation, which strengthens the bond.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3692705"}, {"introduction": "Expert spectral analysis is akin to detective work, where clues can be both present and conspicuously absent.

A solution will be derived by analyzing each option.\n\n### Principal-Based Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is evaluating the validity of arguments based on \"negative evidence\"—the absence of expected spectral bands. Such arguments are only valid if the band in question is predicted to be both (a) characteristic of the functional group or structure being ruled out and (b) intense enough to be easily observed above the noise floor of the instrument. The given experimental conditions, particularly the high signal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathrm{S/N} > 2000$) and low noise floor ($0.1\\,\\%$ transmittance), are excellent and imply that any absorption with even a modest transition dipole moment integral would be detectable. Therefore, the absence of a band can be powerful evidence if the band is known to be inherently strong.\n\nFrom the positive evidence, a preliminary structural hypothesis can be formed:\n1.  The aromatic nature is confirmed by bands at $1600\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n2.  The single, strong $\\mathrm{C=O}$ band at $1735\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is highly indicative of an ester.\n3.  The two strong bands at $1245\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1035\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric $\\mathrm{C–O–C}$ stretches of an ester, respectively, which supports the ester hypothesis.\n4.  The strong band at $830\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ combined with the declared absence of bands in the $690$–$770\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region is a classic pattern for para-disubstitution on an aromatic ring.\n\nThus, the unknown is likely a para-disubstituted aromatic ester. We will now evaluate each option against this background and fundamental spectroscopic principles.\n\n**A. Using the absence of intense bands at $1540$–$1560\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1340$–$1380\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to rule out an aromatic nitro group, because the antisymmetric and symmetric $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ stretches are strongly IR-allowed in this window and would be observed at the stated resolution and $\\mathrm{S/N}$ unless severely overlapped or chemically transformed.**\n\nThe nitro group, $-\\mathrm{NO_2}$, possesses two characteristic stretching vibrations: the antisymmetric stretch ($\\nu_{as}(\\mathrm{NO_2})$) and the symmetric stretch ($\\nu_{s}(\\mathrm{NO_2})$). For aromatic nitro compounds, $\\nu_{as}(\\mathrm{NO_2})$ typically appears between $1550$–$1490\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\nu_{s}(\\mathrm{NO_2})$ between $1355$–$1315\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The ranges specified in the option ($1540$–$1560\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $1340$–$1380\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) are correct diagnostic windows. Crucially, both stretching modes involve a very large change in dipole moment due to the high polarity of the $\\mathrm{N–O}$ bonds. As a result, they are typically two of the most intense absorptions in an IR spectrum. Given the high S/N ratio and low noise floor ($0.1\\,\\%$ transmittance means a band of just $0.23\\,\\%$ absorbance would be detectable at S/N of 2), it is inconceivable that two such strong bands would be \"not detectable\". The possibility of severe overlap is minimal for *both* bands, as they are well-separated from each other and from other strong bands in the spectrum. Therefore, their absence is exceptionally strong evidence for the absence of a nitro group. The reasoning is sound and represents a textbook application of negative evidence.\n\n*Verdict:* **Correct**.\n\n**B. Using the absence of bands at $690$–$770\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, together with the presence of a strong band at $830\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, to rule out meta-disubstitution on the ring and to support para-disubstitution, because the out-of-plane $\\mathrm{C\\!–\\!H}$ bending pattern is substitution-sensitive and IR-allowed.**\n\nThe out-of-plane (OOP) C–H bending vibrations in the $900$–$675\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region are highly reliable for determining the substitution pattern on an aromatic ring. The number and position of these strong bands are determined by the number of adjacent hydrogen atoms on the ring.\n-   *Para-disubstitution* (two sets of two adjacent H's) characteristically shows one strong band in the $860$–$800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range. The observed strong band at $830\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ fits this pattern perfectly.\n-   *Meta-disubstitution* (one set of three adjacent H's and one isolated H) typically shows a strong band from the three-adjacent-H-bend in the $780$–$750\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range and another strong band from a C–C ring pucker in the $710$–$690\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range.\n-   *Ortho-disubstitution* (one set of four adjacent H's) shows a strong band in the $770$–$735\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range.\nThe problem explicitly states there are \"No significant peaks at $690$–$770\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\". This negative evidence effectively rules out ortho- and meta-disubstitution. This, combined with the positive evidence of the strong $830\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band, provides a very strong case for para-disubstitution. The reasoning presented in the option is entirely correct and standard practice.\n\n*Verdict:* **Correct**.\n\n**C. Using the absence of an IR band near $1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to rule out para-disubstitution on the ring, because the ring-breathing mode is diagnostic of para-disubstitution and must appear in IR if present.**\n\nThis statement concerns the \"ring-breathing\" mode, a totally symmetric in-plane vibration of the benzene skeleton. For unsubstituted benzene ($D_{6h}$ symmetry), this mode occurs at $992\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and is IR-inactive by symmetry ($\\partial \\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}}/\\partial Q = 0$), although it is the strongest band in the Raman spectrum. In a para-disubstituted ring, the symmetry is lowered (e.g., to $C_{2v}$ if substituents differ, or $D_{2h}$ if they are identical). In the $D_{2h}$ case, the mode remains IR-inactive. In the $C_{2v}$ case, it becomes formally IR-allowed. However, because the vibration is still fundamentally a symmetric motion of the carbon ring, the change in dipole moment is typically very small. Consequently, the ring-breathing mode is characteristically **weak or absent** in the IR spectrum, even when formally allowed. Its diagnostic power lies in Raman spectroscopy, where it is strong. The assertion that this mode \"must appear in IR if present\" is fundamentally incorrect. Using its absence to *rule out* para-disubstitution is a grave misinterpretation of spectroscopic selection rules.\n\n*Verdict:* **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Using the absence of a single band near $1260$–$1210\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to rule out an aryl ester, because the aryl–oxygen $\\mathrm{C\\!–\\!O}$ stretch is uniquely localized and cannot be shifted or intensity-borrowed outside this narrow window by coupling.**\n\nThis option contains two critical flaws.\nFirst, the premise of the argument is factually incorrect based on the provided data. The argument is based on the \"absence of a single band near $1260$–$1210\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\". However, the problem statement explicitly lists a \"strong band at $1245\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\". This band lies squarely within the specified $1260$–$1210\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ window. Therefore, the argument is self-contradictory.\nSecond, the underlying principle invoked is flawed. The claim that any stretch in the fingerprint region is \"uniquely localized\" and \"cannot be shifted or intensity-borrowed\" is an oversimplification that ignores the fundamental nature of this spectral region. As stated in the problem's own given principles, \"fingerprint region bands arise from coupled skeletal motions\". Single bond stretches like C–O and C–C are of similar energy to bending modes and therefore couple extensively. This means their frequencies and intensities are sensitive to the overall molecular structure, not fixed in a narrow window. While the Ar–O stretch of an aryl ester (Ar–O–C(=O)R) is indeed a useful diagnostic band, often found strong around $1200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, it is not an immutable, isolated vibration.

Sulfoxide ($\\mathrm{S=O}$) stretching absorptions are strong and typically found in the $1030$–$1070\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. Aliphatic ether ($\\mathrm{C–O–C}$) asymmetric stretching absorptions are also strong and typically appear in the $1070$–$1150\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range, but structural variations can shift this band to lower wavenumbers, making an overlap with the sulfoxide band at $1050\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ plausible. The problem represents a realistic challenge in spectroscopic analysis. The proposed categories of methods (spectroscopy, chemical reactions) are standard in chemical structure elucidation.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the evaluation and selection of the *most robust* experimental plan from a given set of options, based on clearly stated criteria. A unique, best option is expected.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, scientific language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with a full analysis of the options.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Options\n\nThe fundamental challenge is to deconvolute two overlapping vibrational bands. An ideal solution will selectively perturb one functional group while leaving the other unaffected, leading to a predictable change in the infrared spectrum that allows for unambiguous assignment. The vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, is given by the harmonic oscillator approximation:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the bond force constant and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the vibrating atoms. A successful experiment will selectively modify either $k$ or $\\mu$ for only one of the two functional groups.\n\n**Option A: Analysis**\nThis option proposes a sophisticated, multi-step approach:\n1.  **Raman Spectroscopy:** The sulfoxide $\\mathrm{S=O}$ bond is highly polarizable and thus gives a strong Raman signal. The ether $\\mathrm{C–O}$ bond is less polarizable. While this can provide supporting evidence based on relative intensities, it is not definitive by itself for deconvoluting an overlapped band.\n2.  **Chemoselective Reduction:** Sulfoxides ($\\mathrm{R_2S=O}$) are known to be selectively reduced to sulfides ($\\mathrm{R_2S}$) using reagents like titanium(III) chloride ($\\mathrm{TiCl_3}$). Ethers are chemically inert under these mild reducing conditions. This step is highly selective. Upon reduction, the $\\mathrm{S=O}$ bond is eliminated, and therefore its characteristic stretching vibration must vanish from the IR spectrum. The portion of the composite band at $1050\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ that disappears can be definitively assigned to the sulfoxide.\n3.  **Isotopic Labeling and Re-oxidation:** The sulfide product is re-oxidized to the sulfoxide using an $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-labeled oxidant. This recreates the sulfoxide functionality, but with an isotopically heavier oxygen atom ($^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ vs. $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$).\n4.  **Prediction of Frequency Shift:** This isotopic substitution increases the reduced mass of the oscillator. Let's calculate the expected shift. The reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{S–O}$ bond is $\\mu = \\frac{m_S m_O}{m_S + m_O}$. Using atomic masses $m(^{32}\\text{S}) \\approx 31.97\\,\\mathrm{u}$, $m(^{16}\\text{O}) \\approx 15.99\\,\\mathrm{u}$, and $m(^{18}\\text{O}) \\approx 18.00\\,\\mathrm{u}$:\n    $$ \\mu(^{16}\\text{O}) = \\frac{31.97 \\times 15.99}{31.97 + 15.99} \\approx 10.66\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n    $$ \\mu(^{18}\\text{O}) = \\frac{31.97 \\times 18.00}{31.97 + 18.00} \\approx 11.51\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n    The ratio of the new frequency ($\\nu_{18}$) to the original frequency ($\\nu_{16}$) is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\nu_{18}}{\\nu_{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu(^{16}\\text{O})}{\\mu(^{18}\\text{O})}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{10.66}{11.51}} \\approx 0.963 $$\n    If the original sulfoxide band is at $1050\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, the new band is predicted to appear at $1050 \\times 0.963 \\approx 1011\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This is a large, predictable, and quantitative downshift of approximately $39\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which would be easily observable. The ether band would remain unshifted.\nThis entire sequence is chemically sound, relies on fundamental principles, and provides multiple, unambiguous, falsifiable tests. It is an exemplary method for spectroscopic assignment.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: Analysis**\nThis option proposes using an acid titration. Both ether and sulfoxide oxygens are Lewis basic and can be protonated by a strong acid like trifluoroacetic acid. Sulfoxide oxygens are generally considered more basic than ether oxygens. Therefore, the statement \"assuming sulfoxide is less perturbed by acid than ether\" is likely incorrect, undermining the proposed logic. Since both functional groups will interact with the acid, both of their corresponding vibrational bands are expected to shift. Differentiating them based on the *magnitude* of the shift is qualitative and ambiguous, not a robust or quantitative method. This approach lacks the required selectivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C: Analysis**\nThis option combines unrelated techniques.\n1.  **Proton NMR:** $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR can confirm the presence of protons alpha to an ether oxygen (typically $\\delta = 3.3–4.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$) and protons alpha to a sulfoxide group (typically $\\delta = 2.5–3.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$). While NMR can confirm the existence of both functionalities in the molecule, it provides no direct link to assign specific vibrational absorptions in the IR spectrum.\n2.  **DSC:** Differential Scanning Calorimetry measures thermal properties. There is no direct, principled way to correlate a thermal transition with the frequency of a specific bond vibration.\nThe final step, \"correlate these data qualitatively,\" is scientifically weak and does not constitute a rigorous method for assignment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D: Analysis**\nThis option suggests hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange. The key premise is that protons on the carbon alpha to an ether oxygen ($\\alpha$-protons) are acidic enough to be exchanged in a basic deuterated solvent. This is chemically false. The p$K_a$ of such protons is typically greater than $40$, meaning they are not acidic and will not exchange under such conditions. While protons $\\alpha$ to a sulfoxide are more acidic (p$K_a \\approx 35$), they still require a very strong base for deprotonation. The proposed chemical transformation is not feasible as described. Furthermore, the assumption of a strong, predictable coupling between the $\\mathrm{C–O}$ stretch and $\\mathrm{C–H}$ bending modes that would lead to a large, assignable shift upon deuteration is speculative. This method is based on a flawed chemical premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: Analysis**\nThis option proposes using polarized ATR-FTIR. This technique (dichroism) can reveal information about the orientation of transition dipole moments, but *only if the sample molecules are ordered* at the ATR crystal interface. For a typical bulk sample of a small organic molecule (either as a neat liquid or cast film from a solution), the molecules are randomly oriented. In such a case, no polarization dependence would be observed for either band. The method's success hinges on an unsubstantiated and unlikely assumption of molecular ordering, making it not a robust or generally applicable technique for this purpose.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A describes the most scientifically rigorous and robust plan. It employs a highly chemoselective reaction to remove one functional group, allowing for a definitive assignment by subtraction. It then confirms this assignment with a second, elegant experiment using isotopic labeling, which produces a large and quantitatively predictable frequency shift. This multi-pronged approach provides unambiguous and falsifiable evidence, perfectly satisfying the problem's requirements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3692830"}]}
