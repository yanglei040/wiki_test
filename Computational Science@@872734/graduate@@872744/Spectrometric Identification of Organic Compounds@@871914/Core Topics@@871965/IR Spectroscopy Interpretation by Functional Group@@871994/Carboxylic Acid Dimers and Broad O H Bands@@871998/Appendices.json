It accurately describes a classic phenomenon in vibrational spectroscopy and poses a well-defined question regarding its physical origin and experimental resolution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of two observable phenomena in the FTIR spectrum of a carboxylic acid dimer: the red-shift and the extreme broadening of the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretching absorption, leading to its overlap with the aliphatic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ stretching bands. It also asks for a strategy to experimentally disentangle these overlapping absorptions.\n\n#### 1. Red-Shift of the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ Stretching Frequency\n\nThe fundamental vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ of a diatomic oscillator is given in the harmonic approximation by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$. The problem statement correctly simplifies this to the proportionality $\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\sqrt{k/\\mu}$, where $k$ is the force constant of the bond and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the vibrating system.\n\nIn an isolated (monomeric) carboxylic acid molecule, the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ bond is a strong covalent bond with a large force constant, $k_{\\text{monomer}}$. This results in a high vibrational frequency, typically observed as a relatively sharp peak around $3500$-$3650\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nIn a nonpolar solvent at moderate concentration, carboxylic acids form cyclic dimers via two strong hydrogen bonds:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R-C} \\underset{\\underset{\\huge{\\vdots}}{\\mathrm{O-H}} \\cdots \\mathrm{O}}{\\overset{\\overset{\\mathrm{O} \\cdots \\mathrm{H-O}}{\\huge{\\vdots}}}{}} \\mathrm{C-R}\n$$\n\nThe hydrogen atom of each hydroxyl group is attracted to the carbonyl oxygen of the partner molecule. This electrostatic attraction constitutes the hydrogen bond ($\\mathrm{O-H} \\cdots \\mathrm{O}$). The formation of this hydrogen bond perturbs the electron density of the covalent $\\mathrm{O-H}$ bond, effectively pulling the hydrogen atom away from the oxygen it is covalently bonded to. This elongates and weakens the original $\\mathrm{O-H}$ covalent bond.\n\nA weaker bond corresponds to a smaller force constant, so $k_{\\text{dimer}}  k_{\\text{monomer}}$. According to the relationship $\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\sqrt{k}$, a decrease in the force constant $k$ leads to a decrease in the vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$. This shift to a lower frequency (longer wavelength) is known as a red-shift. For the strong hydrogen bonds in carboxylic acid dimers, this effect is exceptionally large, shifting the absorption from $\\approx 3600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ down into the $2500$-$3300\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ range.\n\n#### 2. Broadening of the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ Stretching Absorption\n\nThe extreme breadth of the dimer $\\mathrm{O-H}$ absorption is a result of several contributing factors:\n\n*   **Inhomogeneous Broadening:** In a liquid or solution, the ensemble of dimer molecules exists in a distribution of microstates. The geometry of the hydrogen bonds (e.g., the $\\mathrm{O} \\cdots \\mathrm{H}$ distance and the $\\mathrm{O-H} \\cdots \\mathrm{O}$ angle) is not fixed but fluctuates due to low-frequency intermolecular vibrations and collisions. This creates a near-continuum of different local environments, each with a slightly different $\\mathrm{O-H}$ effective force constant $k$. The observed spectrum is a superposition of all these slightly different absorption frequencies, resulting in a broad band.\n\n*   **Anharmonicity and Fermi Resonance:** The potential energy surface for an $\\mathrm{O-H}$ bond involved in a strong hydrogen bond is highly anharmonic—it deviates significantly from the simple parabolic potential of a harmonic oscillator. Anharmonicity has two critical consequences:\n    1.  It creates a manifold of closely spaced vibrational energy levels.\n    2.  It relaxes the strict selection rule ($\\Delta v = \\pm 1$), allowing transitions to combination and overtone bands (which would be forbidden in a purely harmonic system) to gain intensity.\n\n    **Fermi Resonance** is a specific consequence of anharmonicity where two vibrational states of the same symmetry and nearly the same energy can mix. The $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch fundamental ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}$), while red-shifted, is still intrinsically very intense due to the large change in dipole moment during the vibration. The molecule has many other lower-frequency fundamental vibrations, such as the in-plane $\\mathrm{O-H}$ bend ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{O-H}}$) near $1400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and the $\\mathrm{C-O}$ stretch near $1300\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The first overtone of the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ bend ($2\\delta_{\\mathrm{O-H}}$) would have an energy of approximately $2 \\times 1400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = 2800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. A combination band of the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ stretch ($\\approx 1710\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$) and the $\\mathrm{C-O}$ stretch ($\\approx 1300\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$) would have an energy of approximately $1710 + 1300 = 3010\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n    These overtone and combination modes, which lie in the same energy region as the red-shifted $\\nu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}$ fundamental, can couple with it. Through this coupling, the strong intensity of the $\\nu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}$ fundamental is distributed among a multitude of otherwise weak states. This transforms a single absorption peak into a complex series of many smaller peaks that are so numerous and close together that they merge into an extremely broad and structured absorption band. The fact that the aliphatic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ window ($2850$-$2960\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$) is overlapped is a direct consequence of Fermi anresonance with states like $2\\delta_{\\mathrm{O-H}}$ which \"borrows\" intensity and places it squarely in this region.\n\n#### 3. Spectrometric Strategy for Disentanglement\n\nTo separate the broad $\\mathrm{O-H}$ band from the sharp $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bands, one must either move the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ absorption or eliminate it.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Isotopic Substitution.** Replacing the acidic proton ($\\mathrm{H}$) with its heavier isotope deuterium ($\\mathrm{D}$) changes the reduced mass $\\mu$ of the oscillator while leaving the force constant $k$ virtually unchanged (Born-Oppenheimer approximation). Let's calculate the expected shift.\n    The reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ oscillator is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{O}}+m_{\\mathrm{H}}}$. Using $m_{\\mathrm{O}}=16$ and $m_{\\mathrm{H}}=1$, we get $\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}} = \\frac{16 \\times 1}{16+1} = \\frac{16}{17}$ amu.\n    The reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{O-D}$ oscillator is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}}m_{\\mathrm{D}}}{m_{\\mathrm{O}}+m_{\\mathrm{D}}}$. Using $m_{\\mathrm{D}}=2$, we get $\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}} = \\frac{16 \\times 2}{16+2} = \\frac{32}{18} = \\frac{16}{9}$ amu.\n    The ratio of the wavenumbers is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OD}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OH}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k/\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}{k/\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16/17}{16/9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{17}} \\approx 0.7276 $$\n    Thus, an $\\mathrm{O-H}$ absorption centered near $3000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ would shift to $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OD}} \\approx 0.73 \\times 3000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = 2190\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. This new position is well below the aliphatic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ window ($2850$-$2960\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$), effectively removing the overlap. The $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bands would remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Shifting the Dimer-Monomer Equilibrium.** The dimerization is a reversible equilibrium: $2 \\mathrm{RCOOH} \\rightleftharpoons (\\mathrm{RCOOH})_2$. According to Le Chatelier's principle, we can shift this equilibrium toward the monomer.\n    -   **Dilution:** Decreasing the concentration of the acid favors the species with higher stoichiometry, i.e., the monomer.\n    -   **Change of Solvent:** The problem specifies a nonpolar solvent, which favors dimerization. Switching to a polar, aprotic solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, THF) that can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor will stabilize the monomer by forming solvent-solute hydrogen bonds, thus breaking up the dimers.\n    -   **Increasing Temperature:** Dimerization is an exothermic process. Increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium in the endothermic direction, favoring the dissociation of the dimer into monomers.\n    Executing any of these changes would cause the broad dimer $\\mathrm{O-H}$ absorption ($2500$-$3300\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$) to decrease in intensity, while a new, relatively sharp absorption for the free monomer $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch appears around $3500$-$3650\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. This new band is far from the $\\mathrm{C-H}$ region, thus resolving the overlap.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Strong hydrogen bonding in the cyclic dimer lowers the effective $\\mathrm{O-H}$ force constant $k$ (weakening the bond) and introduces a distribution of $k$ values across microstates, which broadens the band. Anharmonicity enables Fermi resonance between the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch and the first overtone of a bending mode near $1400\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ (overtone $\\approx 2\\times 1400=2800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$), creating intensity in the $2800$-$3000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ region that overlaps $\\mathrm{C-H}$. A practical resolution is to exchange $\\mathrm{H}$ for $\\mathrm{D}$, for which $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OD}}\\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OH}}\\sqrt{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}/\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}\\approx 0.73\\,\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OH}}$; thus a $3000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ center moves to $\\approx 2200\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, outside the $2850$-$2960\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ window.**\nThis option provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation. It correctly identifies the reduction of $k$ for the red-shift, the distribution of microstates and Fermi resonance for the broadening and overlap, and proposes isotopic substitution as a valid resolution. The quantitative estimate for the isotopic shift is correctly derived and demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The overlap occurs because aliphatic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ stretches themselves blue-shift under the electric field of the hydrogen bond into the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ domain, and the best resolution is to use a highly nonpolar solvent to suppress $\\mathrm{C-H}$ transitions entirely.**\nThis option is incorrect. The primary phenomenon is the massive red-shift of the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ band, not a significant shift of the $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bands. The positions of aliphatic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ stretches are relatively insensitive to this type of long-range field effect. Furthermore, the proposed resolution is nonsensical; a solvent does not \"suppress\" an intrinsic vibrational transition like a $\\mathrm{C-H}$ stretch. If anything, a more nonpolar solvent would promote dimerization, exacerbating the problem as described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The broad dimer band overlaps the $\\mathrm{C-H}$ region partly because of Fermi resonance that redistributes intensity toward $\\approx 2800$-$3000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and partly because $k$ is reduced by hydrogen bonding, red-shifting the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch. A practical resolution is to shift the dimer–monomer equilibrium by diluting in a polar aprotic solvent and raising temperature, thereby favoring monomers whose free $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch appears as a relatively sharp band at $\\approx 3600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, well-separated from $2850$-$2960\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.**\nThis option also provides a correct explanation for the overlap, citing both the red-shift due to weakened $k$ and the role of Fermi resonance. The proposed resolution strategy—shifting the dimer-monomer equilibrium—is a standard and effective method. The conditions suggested (dilution, polar aprotic solvent, increased temperature) are all valid applications of Le Chatelier's principle to achieve this goal. The prediction that the monomer band will appear, sharp and well-separated, is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The apparent overlap is primarily an artifact of insufficient spectral resolution in FTIR (e.g., a resolution of $16\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$); acquiring spectra at $1\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ resolution will fully separate the dimer $\\mathrm{O-H}$ band from the aliphatic $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bands without any change in sample or conditions.**\nThis option is incorrect. It misidentifies an intrinsic physical phenomenon (a band width of hundreds of $\\text{cm}^{-1}$) as an instrumental artifact. The broadening is real, not a result of poor resolution. While higher resolution would better define the shapes of the sharp $\\mathrm{C-H}$ peaks, it would not eliminate the underlying broad absorption from the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ dimer on which they are superimposed. The overlap is one of superposition, not unresolved adjacent peaks.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "AC", "id": "3695268"}, {"introduction": "Beyond qualitative identification, spectroscopy is a powerful tool for quantitative analysis of chemical equilibria.
