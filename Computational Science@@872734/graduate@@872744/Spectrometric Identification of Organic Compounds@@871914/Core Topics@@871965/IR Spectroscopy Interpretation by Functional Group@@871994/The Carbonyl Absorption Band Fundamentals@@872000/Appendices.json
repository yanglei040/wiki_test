The transition energy is the difference between the excited state energy and the ground state energy $E_0 = E(0,0)$.\n\nThe unperturbed transition wavenumber for the carbonyl stretch fundamental ($\\lvert v_{S}=1, v_{B}=0\\rangle \\leftarrow \\lvert v_{S}=0, v_{B}=0\\rangle$) is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} = E(1,0) - E(0,0) = (G_S(1) + G_B(0)) - (G_S(0) + G_B(0)) = G_S(1) - G_S(0)$$\nUsing the term value formula:\n$$G_S(1) = \\omega_e^{(S)}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{2}\\omega_e^{(S)} - \\frac{9}{4}\\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)}$$\n$$G_S(0) = \\omega_e^{(S)}\\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)}\\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_e^{(S)} - \\frac{1}{4}\\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)}$$\nThus, the unperturbed fundamental transition wavenumber is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\omega_e^{(S)} - \\frac{9}{4}\\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_e^{(S)} - \\frac{1}{4}\\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)}\\right) = \\omega_e^{(S)} - 2\\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)}$$\n\nThe unperturbed transition wavenumber for the in-plane bending overtone ($\\lvert v_{S}=0, v_{B}=2\\rangle \\leftarrow \\lvert v_{S}=0, v_{B}=0\\rangle$) is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} = E(0,2) - E(0,0) = (G_S(0) + G_B(2)) - (G_S(0) + G_B(0)) = G_B(2) - G_B(0)$$\nUsing the term value formula:\n$$G_B(2) = \\omega_e^{(B)}\\left(2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)}\\left(2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{5}{2}\\omega_e^{(B)} - \\frac{25}{4}\\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)}$$\n$$G_B(0) = \\omega_e^{(B)}\\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)}\\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_e^{(B)} - \\frac{1}{4}\\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)}$$\nThus, the unperturbed overtone transition wavenumber is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} = \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\omega_e^{(B)} - \\frac{25}{4}\\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_e^{(B)} - \\frac{1}{4}\\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)}\\right) = 2\\omega_e^{(B)} - 6\\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)}$$\n\nNow, we introduce the Fermi coupling $F$ between these two zero-order states. The interaction is described by a $2 \\times 2$ Hamiltonian matrix in the basis of the unperturbed transition wavenumbers:\n$$H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} & F \\\\ F & \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of this matrix represent the observed wavenumbers of the mixed states. They are found by solving the secular determinant:\n$$\\begin{vmatrix} \\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} - \\lambda & F \\\\ F & \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} - \\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = 0$$\nThis yields the characteristic equation:\n$$(\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} - \\lambda)(\\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} - \\lambda) - F^2 = 0$$\n$$\\lambda^2 - (\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} + \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)})\\lambda + (\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)}\\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} - F^2) = 0$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $\\lambda$ gives the two observed wavenumbers, $\\lambda_{\\pm}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{(\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} + \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)}) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} + \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)})^2 - 4(\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)}\\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} - F^2)}}{2}$$\nSimplifying the term under the square root:\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{(\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} + \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)}) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} - \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)})^2 + 4F^2}}{2}$$\nThis equation shows that the two observed levels are pushed apart from their average energy by an amount determined by their initial separation, $\\Delta = \\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} - \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)}$, and the coupling strength $F$.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\omega_{e}^{(S)} = 1800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $x_{e}^{(S)} = 0.0105$\n$\\omega_{e}^{(B)} = 890\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $x_{e}^{(B)} = 0.0060$\n$F = 16.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n\nCalculate the product $\\omega_e x_e$ for each mode:\n$$\\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)} = 1800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\times 0.0105 = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$\\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)} = 890\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\times 0.0060 = 5.34\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nCalculate the unperturbed wavenumbers:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} = \\omega_e^{(S)} - 2\\omega_e^{(S)} x_e^{(S)} = 1800 - 2(18.9) = 1800 - 37.8 = 1762.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} = 2\\omega_e^{(B)} - 6\\omega_e^{(B)} x_e^{(B)} = 2(890) - 6(5.34) = 1780 - 32.04 = 1747.96\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we can find the values needed for the final calculation:\nThe average of the unperturbed wavenumbers:\n$$\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} + \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)}}{2} = \\frac{1762.2 + 1747.96}{2} = \\frac{3510.16}{2} = 1755.08\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\nThe separation of the unperturbed wavenumbers:\n$$\\Delta = \\tilde{\\nu}_S^{(0)} - \\tilde{\\nu}_B^{(0)} = 1762.2 - 1747.96 = 14.24\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $\\lambda_{\\pm}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm} = 1755.08 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(14.24)^2 + 4(16.0)^2}$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm} = 1755.08 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{202.7776 + 4(256)}$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm} = 1755.08 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{202.7776 + 1024}$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm} = 1755.08 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1226.7776}$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm} = 1755.08 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}(35.025385...)$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\pm} = 1755.08 \\pm 17.51269...$$\n\nThe two observed wavenumbers are:\n$$\\lambda_+ = 1755.08 + 17.51269... = 1772.59269...\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$\\lambda_- = 1755.08 - 17.51269... = 1737.56731...\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the higher of the two observed wavenumbers, which is $\\lambda_+$.\n$$\\lambda_+ \\approx 1772.59\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $1773\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1773}$$", "id": "3726710"}]}
