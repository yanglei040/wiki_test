Decomposition of $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}}$ into its constituent irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ point group.\n3.  Application of the IR selection rule to determine the number of IR-active modes.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the Reducible Representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}}$**\n\nThe basis set consists of the four out-of-plane displacement coordinates of the hydrogens at positions $2$, $3$, $5$, and $6$. Let these be denoted by vectors perpendicular to the molecular plane. The character $\\chi_{\\Gamma}(g)$ of the reducible representation for each symmetry operation $g$ is found by counting the number of hydrogen atoms that are not moved by the operation, multiplied by the character of the transformation of the $z$-coordinate under that operation.\n\nThe transformation of a vector along the $z$-axis under each operation is:\n- $E(z) \\rightarrow z$: character $+1$\n- $C_{2}(z)(z) \\rightarrow z$: character $+1$\n- $C_{2}(y)(z) \\rightarrow -z$: character $-1$\n- $C_{2}(x)(z) \\rightarrow -z$: character $-1$\n- $i(z) \\rightarrow -z$: character $-1$\n- $\\sigma_{xy}(z) \\rightarrow -z$: character $-1$\n- $\\sigma_{xz}(z) \\rightarrow z$: character $+1$\n- $\\sigma_{yz}(z) \\rightarrow z$: character $+1$\n\nNow we determine the number of unshifted hydrogen atoms for each operation:\n- $E$: The identity operation leaves all $4$ hydrogens unmoved. $\\chi(E) = 4 \\times (+1) = 4$.\n- $C_{2}(z)$: Rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the $z$-axis (perpendicular to the ring's center). It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_5$ and $H_3 \\leftrightarrow H_6$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(C_{2}(z)) = 0 \\times (+1) = 0$.\n- $C_{2}(y)$: Rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the $y$-axis. It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_3$ and $H_5 \\leftrightarrow H_6$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(C_{2}(y)) = 0 \\times (-1) = 0$.\n- $C_{2}(x)$: Rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about the $x$-axis (passing through the substituents). It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_6$ and $H_3 \\leftrightarrow H_5$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(C_{2}(x)) = 0 \\times (-1) = 0$.\n- $i$: Inversion through the center of the ring. It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_5$ and $H_3 \\leftrightarrow H_6$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(i) = 0 \\times (-1) = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_{xy}$: Reflection in the molecular plane. All $4$ hydrogen atoms lie in this plane and are unshifted. The displacement vectors are perpendicular to the plane and are inverted ($z \\rightarrow -z$). $\\chi(\\sigma_{xy}) = 4 \\times (-1) = -4$.\n- $\\sigma_{xz}$: Reflection in the vertical plane containing the substituents. It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_6$ and $H_3 \\leftrightarrow H_5$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(\\sigma_{xz}) = 0 \\times (+1) = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_{yz}$: Reflection in the vertical plane bisecting the C-C bonds. It swaps $H_2 \\leftrightarrow H_3$ and $H_5 \\leftrightarrow H_6$. $0$ atoms are unshifted. $\\chi(\\sigma_{yz}) = 0 \\times (+1) = 0$.\n\nThus, the characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}}$ in the order $(E, C_{2}(z), C_{2}(y), C_{2}(x), i, \\sigma_{xy}, \\sigma_{xz}, \\sigma_{yz})$ are:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}} = (4, 0, 0, 0, 0, -4, 0, 0) $$\n\n**Part 2: Decomposition of $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}}$**\n\nThe number of times an irreducible representation $r$ is contained in $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}}$ is given by the reduction formula:\n$$ n_{r} = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{g \\in G} \\chi_{\\Gamma}(g) \\chi_{r}(g) $$\nHere, the order of the group $D_{2h}$ is $h=8$.

So, $n_{r} = \\frac{1}{2} [1 - \\chi_{r}(\\sigma_{xy})]$.\n\nUsing the provided character table:\n- $\\mathrm{A}_{g}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{1g}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{2g}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{3g}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{A}_{u}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{1u}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{2u}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{3u}: n = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$\n\nThe decomposition of the reducible representation is:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{oop}} = \\mathrm{B}_{2g} + \\mathrm{B}_{3g} + \\mathrm{A}_{u} + \\mathrm{B}_{1u} $$\nThis decomposition correctly accounts for all four vibrational modes, as the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible representations is $1+1+1+1=4$, which equals the dimension of the reducible representation, $\\chi_{\\Gamma}(E)=4$.\n\n**Part 3: Application of IR Selection Rule**\n\nA vibrational mode is IR-active if its symmetry species is the same as one of the components of the electric dipole moment vector. For the $D_{2h}$ point group, these components transform as:\n- $x \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}_{3u}$\n- $y \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}_{2u}$\n- $z \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}_{1u}$\n\nWe compare the symmetries of the four out-of-plane bending modes with the symmetries required for IR activity:\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{2g}$: Not IR-active.\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{3g}$: Not IR-active.\n- $\\mathrm{A}_{u}$: Not IR-active.\n- $\\mathrm{B}_{1u}$: IR-active, as it transforms as the $z$-component of the dipole moment.\n\nOnly the mode with $\\mathrm{B}_{1u}$ symmetry is IR-active. Since each non-degenerate mode corresponds to a distinct vibrational band, there is only one IR-active out-of-plane C-H bending band expected.\n\nThe number of distinct IR-active bands is $1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "3717285"}, {"introduction": "While symmetry dictates which vibrations are IR-active, the harmonic oscillator model helps us predict their frequencies.

A third characteristic band, arising from a ring deformation coupled with C-H wags, is also consistently observed, usually strong, in the $680$–$725$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range.\n    The presence of this triad of bands is a strong signature for meta-disubstitution.\n- **Para-disubstitution** ($1,4$-): This pattern leaves two equivalent blocks of $2$ adjacent hydrogens. Due to the molecule's symmetry (e.g., $D_{2h}$ for identical substituents), only one out-of-plane wagging mode is IR-active. This mode involves the symmetric out-of-phase wagging of the two pairs of hydrogens and results in a single, characteristic strong absorption in the $800$–$860$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range.\n\nBased on these principles, we can establish the correct classification for the three unknown compounds before evaluating the proposed classifiers.\n\n- **Unknown U1: $753$ (strong, sharp).**\nThis spectrum shows a single, strong absorption at $753$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This frequency falls directly into the characteristic range for $4$ adjacent C–H bonds ($735$–$770$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). The presence of a single strong band in this region is the classic signature of an **ortho-disubstituted** benzene.\n\n- **Unknown U2: $702$ (weak), $783$ (medium), $891$ (strong).**\nThis spectrum displays three peaks.\n    - The peak at $891$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in the range for an isolated C–H wag ($860$–$900$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\n    - The peak at $783$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in the range for $3$-adjacent C–H wags ($750$–$810$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\n    - The peak at $702$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in the third characteristic region for meta-isomers ($680$–$725$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\nThe simultaneous presence of bands in these three distinct regions is the definitive pattern for a **meta-disubstituted** benzene. The intensities (weak, medium, strong) are consistent with this assignment, where fundamentals are expected to be stronger than any overtones.\n\n- **Unknown U3: $835$ (strong), $701$ (very weak), $872$ (weak).**\nThe most prominent feature is the strong band at $835$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This falls perfectly within the characteristic range for $2$-adjacent C–H wags ($800$–$860$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$), which indicates **para-disubstitution**. The other two peaks at $701$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $872$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ are weak or very weak. According to the problem's assumptions, these are to be considered overtone or combination bands, which are permitted and do not override the clear signature of the strong fundamental.\n\nThus, the correct classifications are: U1 = ortho, U2 = meta, U3 = para. We will now evaluate each classifier against this ground truth.\n\n**Analysis of Classifier A**\nThis classifier uses a multi-feature decision tree based on spectral windows and intensities.\n- For U1 ($753$ (strong)):\n    - Meta test: Fails (requires three bands).\n    - Ortho test: Strong band at $753$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in the $735$–$770$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ window. No strong band in $800$–$860$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The rule is satisfied. Assigns **ortho**. Correct.\n- For U2 ($702$ (weak), $783$ (medium), $891$ (strong)):\n    - Meta test: Finds a band in all three required regions: $702$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ (in $680$–$725$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$), $783$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ (in $750$–$810$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$), and $891$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ (in $860$–$910$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). The highest-frequency band ($891$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) is strong. The rule is satisfied. Assigns **meta**. Correct.\n- For U3 ($835$ (strong), $701$ (very weak), $872$ (weak)):\n    - Meta test: Fails (missing a band in the $750$–$810$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ region).\n    - Ortho test: Fails (no strong band in $735$–$770$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\n    - Para test: Strong band at $835$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in the $800$–$860$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ window. The rule permits weak features elsewhere. The rule is satisfied. Assigns **para**. Correct.\nThis classifier correctly identifies all three unknowns. Its logic aligns perfectly with the established spectroscopic principles, incorporating band position, number, and intensity criteria.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Classifier B**\nThis classifier uses an exclusion rule followed by a strongest-band heuristic.\n- For U1 ($753$ (strong)):\n    - No band in $690$–$710$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Para is not excluded.\n    - Strongest band is at $753$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is in the $735$–$770$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. Assigns **ortho**. Correct.\n- For U2 ($702$ (weak), $783$ (medium), $891$ (strong)):\n    - Band at $702$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in the $690$–$710$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. Para is excluded.\n    - Strongest band is at $891$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is in the $860$–$910$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. Assigns **meta**. Correct.\n- For U3 ($835$ (strong), $701$ (very weak), $872$ (weak)):\n    - Band at $701$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in the $690$–$710$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. Para is excluded.\n    - The strongest band is at $835$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is in the $800$–$860$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range, corresponding to the 'para' rule. However, the 'para' assignment has already been excluded by the first step. The classifier reaches a contradiction or fails to produce an assignment for U3.\nThis classifier fails for U3. The initial exclusion rule is too rigid, as it does not distinguish between a strong fundamental (as seen in monosubstituted or some meta-disubstituted benzenes) and a weak overtone/combination band (as seen in U3).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Classifier C**\nThis classifier uses a simple heuristic based only on the highest-wavenumber peak, ignoring all other information.\n- For U1 ($753$ (strong)):\n    - The highest-wavenumber peak is $753$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which falls in the $735$–$770$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. Assigns **ortho**. Correct.\n- For U2 ($702$ (weak), $783$ (medium), $891$ (strong)):\n    - The highest-wavenumber peak is $891$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is above $880$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Assigns **meta**. Correct.\n- For U3 ($835$ (strong), $701$ (very weak), $872$ (weak)):\n    - The highest-wavenumber peak is $872$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This value does not fall into any of the three defined classification windows ($>880$, $800$–$860$, or $735$–$770$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). The classifier returns **ambiguous**.\nThis classifier fails for U3. This heuristic is not robust because it incorrectly prioritizes a weak, non-fundamental peak ($872$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) over the strong fundamental ($835$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) and ignores the physical significance of intensity and overall pattern.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Classifier D**\nThis classifier uses the crudest heuristic: simply counting the number of observed peaks, ignoring both position and intensity.\n- For U1 ($753$ (strong)):\n    - The peak count is $1$. Assigns **ortho**. Correct.\n- For U2 ($702$ (weak), $783$ (medium), $891$ (strong)):\n    - The peak count is $3$. Assigns **meta**. Correct.\n- For U3 ($835$ (strong), $701$ (very weak), $872$ (weak)):\n    - The peak count is $3$. Assigns **meta**. Incorrect.\nThis classifier fails for U3. Its logic is fundamentally flawed as it cannot distinguish a spectrum with three fundamentals (like a meta-isomer) from a spectrum with one strong fundamental and two weak overtones (like U3, a para-isomer). Spectroscopy requires consideration of peak position, intensity, and shape, not just a raw count.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only Classifier A successfully classifies all three unknown compounds. Its rules are the most comprehensive and correctly reflect the established principles of IR spectroscopy for analyzing benzene substitution patterns. It properly utilizes band positions, the multiplicity of key bands, and intensity information to make a correct and robust assignment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3717279"}]}
