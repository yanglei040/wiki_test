The harmonic oscillator is a standard and effective first-order model for molecular vibrations. The concept of reduced mass is fundamental to two-body problems. The assumption that the force constant is unaffected by isotopic substitution is a direct consequence of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which is standard in this context. The provided atomic masses are precise and factually correct. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution under the given assumptions. The distinction between an amine and an amide is noted; however, the strict instruction to model the vibration as a \"two-body oscillator\" implies that only the masses of the two atoms forming the bond ($N$ and $H$/$D$) are to be considered in the calculation of the reduced mass. Any influence from the rest of the molecule is excluded by this simplification. Therefore, the calculated ratio will be identical for both amines and amides within the confines of the specified model. This is a feature of the problem testing adherence to its stated assumptions, not a flaw.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nWithin the harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, of a diatomic system is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two-body system. The reduced mass for two atoms of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\n$$\n\nFor the $N$–$H$ bond, the masses are $m_{\\mathrm{N}}$ and $m_{\\mathrm{H}}$. The reduced mass, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}}$, is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}}\n$$\nThe corresponding vibrational frequency, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}$, is:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{NH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}}}}\n$$\n\nFor the isotopically substituted $N$–$D$ bond, the masses are $m_{\\mathrm{N}}$ and $m_{\\mathrm{D}}$. The reduced mass, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}}$, is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{D}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{D}}}\n$$\nThe corresponding vibrational frequency, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}$, is:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}}\n$$\n\nThe problem states to assume that isotopic substitution does not alter the force constant, so $k_{\\mathrm{NH}} = k_{\\mathrm{ND}} = k$. We seek the isotopic frequency ratio, $\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}}$. Dividing the expression for $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}$ by that for $\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}}\n$$\nThis shows that the frequency ratio is determined solely by the inverse square root of the ratio of the reduced masses.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}}$ into this equation yields the dependence on the atomic masses:\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}}}{\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{D}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{D}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}} \\cdot \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{D}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{D}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\cdot \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{D}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the isotopic frequency ratio.\n\nThe problem asks for this ratio to be computed for an amine and an amide. As established during validation, the model is strictly a two-body oscillator involving only the nitrogen and hydrogen/deuterium atoms. In this model, the chemical environment (what distinguishes an amine from an amide) has no influence on the reduced mass. The force constant $k$ would differ in reality, but it cancels out of the ratio. Therefore, the calculation based on this model yields the same ratio for both molecular classes.\n\nWe now substitute the given atomic masses into the derived expression. The atomic mass units ($\\mathrm{u}$) cancel, so we can use the numerical values directly.\n$m_{\\mathrm{N}} = 14.003074$\n$m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007825$\n$m_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2.014102$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.007825}{2.014102} \\cdot \\frac{14.003074 + 2.014102}{14.003074 + 1.007825}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.007825}{2.014102} \\cdot \\frac{16.017176}{15.010899}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}} = \\sqrt{(0.50038480...) \\cdot (1.0670350...)}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}} = \\sqrt{0.53396238...}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{NH}}} = 0.73072715...\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, we get $0.7307$.\nSince the model does not differentiate between amines and amides, this value applies to both cases as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7307  0.7307\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3714395"}, {"introduction": "The spectra of amides are often complicated by phenomena beyond simple fundamental vibrations, most notably Fermi resonance.

Assess the condition for Fermi resonance between $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{ND}}$ and $2\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II'}}$.\n\n### Step 1: N–D Stretching Frequency Calculation\nThe frequency of the N–H stretch is given as approximately $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{NH}} \\approx 3300\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. We use the harmonic oscillator scaling law, $\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\sqrt{1/\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass.\n\nThe ratio of the N–D to N–H frequencies is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{ND}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{NH}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the reduced masses for the N–H and N–D bonds using the provided atomic masses ($m_{\\mathrm{H}}=1\\,\\mathrm{amu}$, $m_{\\mathrm{D}}=2\\,\\mathrm{amu}$, $m_{\\mathrm{N}}=14\\,\\mathrm{amu}$):\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{14 \\times 1}{14 + 1} = \\frac{14}{15}\\,\\mathrm{amu}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{N}} m_{\\mathrm{D}}}{m_{\\mathrm{N}} + m_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{14 \\times 2}{14 + 2} = \\frac{28}{16} = \\frac{7}{4}\\,\\mathrm{amu}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the frequency scaling factor:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{14/15}{7/4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{14}{15} \\times \\frac{4}{7}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 4}{15}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{15}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5333} \\approx 0.730\n$$\nUsing this factor, we find the frequency of the N–D stretch:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{ND}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{NH}} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{NH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ND}}}} \\approx 3300\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}} \\times 0.730 \\approx 2410\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\n$$\nThus, the N–D stretching fundamental is expected to appear in the range of $2400$–$2500\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\n### Step 2: Deuterated Amide II Mode Frequency and its Overtone\nThe original amide II mode is at $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II}} \\approx 1550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The problem provides effective masses for this mixed mode before and after deuteration: $m_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{H}}=11\\,\\mathrm{amu}$ and $m_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{D}}=12\\,\\mathrm{amu}$.

These two levels are close in energy (detuning $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = |3300-3100|=200\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$), allowing for the resonance that produces the amide A and B bands.\n\nAfter deuteration, we must check for near-degeneracy between the new fundamental, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{ND}}$, and the new overtone, $2\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II'}}$:\n- Fundamental: $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{ND}} \\approx 2410\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\n- Overtone: $2\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II'}} \\approx 2968\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\n\nThe detuning between these two levels is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = |2968\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}} - 2410\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}| = 558\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\n$$\nThis frequency difference is large. As stated in the problem, \"large detuning...suppresses the effect\". Therefore, the Fermi resonance interaction will be negligible in the deuterated amide. The consequence is that the amide B band, which owes its existence to this resonance, will disappear or be significantly suppressed. The spectrum will be dominated by a single N–D stretching band near its calculated fundamental frequency.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The N–D stretch shifts to approximately $2400$–$2500\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and the amide B band is suppressed because the overtone of the deuterated amide II mode ($2\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II'}}$) lies near $2900\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, far from the N–D stretch, detuning the Fermi resonance.**\n- The N–D stretch is calculated to be $\\approx 2410\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is in the $2400$–$2500\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. This is correct.\n- The overtone of the deuterated amide II mode is calculated to be $\\approx 2968\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Stating this lies \"near $2900\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\" is a reasonable approximation in this context.\n- This overtone frequency is indeed far from the N–D stretch frequency, leading to a large detuning that suppresses the Fermi resonance and therefore the amide B band. The reasoning is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The N–D stretch shifts to approximately $2400$–$2500\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and a new amide B persists near $2300\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ due to continued Fermi resonance with $2\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II'}}$ that also shifts near $2400\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.**\n- The first part of the statement is correct.\n- However, the claim that the overtone $2\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{II'}}$ shifts to \"near $2400\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\" is factually incorrect based on the provided model. Our calculation shows it shifts to $\\approx 2968\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Since the condition for continued Fermi resonance is not met, a new amide B band would not be expected to form as described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both amide A and amide B remain near $3300$ and $3100\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, respectively, but both decrease in intensity due to isotopic dilution, with minimal frequency changes.**\n- This statement violates the fundamental principle of isotopic shifts in vibrational spectroscopy. The mass of the vibrating atom (H vs. D) changes by a factor of $2$. This leads to a substantial, not minimal, frequency shift for any mode involving the motion of that atom. The N–H stretch will become an N–D stretch at a much lower frequency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The N–D stretch appears near $2700\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and Fermi resonance is strengthened, producing two distinct N–D bands near $2700$ and $2900\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.**\n- The claim that the N–D stretch appears near $2700\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is incorrect. Our calculation based on the problem's parameters gives $\\approx 2410\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n- Consequently, the discussion of a strengthened Fermi resonance based on an incorrect fundamental frequency is also invalid. The actual frequencies ($2410\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $2968\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) are far apart, weakening, not strengthening, the resonance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3714340"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of spectroscopy is often to connect spectral features to specific molecular structures and conformations.

The conformational dependencies are expressed as empirical models, which is a standard and valid approach in computational biophysics and chemistry for modeling complex environmental effects.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete, deterministic sequence of calculations. All required constants and functional forms are explicitly given. For any valid input tuple, a unique set of outputs can be calculated. The diagonalization of the $2 \\times 2$ real symmetric Hamiltonian matrix guarantees two real eigenvalues, ensuring a unique solution for the observable wavenumbers.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical and physical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based components.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. All necessary numerical values, constants, and equations are provided. A check of the units confirms their consistency: the calculation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{stretch}}$ correctly yields units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The parameters for exponential functions have inverse units to their corresponding variables (e.g., $B$ in $\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$ for $r$ in $\\mathrm{\\AA}$), making the exponents dimensionless as required.\n- **No other flaws are identified.** The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, or contradictory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n## Principle-Based Solution\n\nThe solution involves a multi-step calculation that models how a dipeptide's backbone conformation $(\\phi, \\psi)$ influences its amide A and amide B vibrational bands. The process integrates principles from classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and spectroscopy.\n\n**1. Reduced Mass of the N-H Oscillator**\nThe N-H bond is modeled as a two-body harmonic oscillator. Its vibrational dynamics are described using the reduced mass, $\\mu$, which simplifies the two-body problem into an equivalent one-body problem.\nUsing the provided masses for Hydrogen ($m_{\\mathrm{H}}$) and Nitrogen ($m_{\\mathrm{N}}$):\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}} m_{\\mathrm{N}}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}} + m_{\\mathrm{N}}} $$\nThis constant value will be used for all subsequent stretch frequency calculations.\n\n**2. Conformational Geometry**\nThe peptide backbone conformation, defined by the dihedral angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$, dictates the local environment of the N-H bond. This environment is characterized by the geometry of the hydrogen bond formed between the N-H group (donor) and a nearby carbonyl oxygen (acceptor). The problem provides empirical functions to map $(\\phi, \\psi)$ to the donor-acceptor distance $r$ and the N-H···O angle $\\theta$. Since the input angles are in degrees, they must be converted to radians for use with standard trigonometric functions in most numerical libraries.\n$$ r(\\phi,\\psi) = r_{\\mathrm{ref}} - d \\cos(\\phi_{\\mathrm{rad}}) \\cos(\\psi_{\\mathrm{rad}}) $$\n$$ \\theta(\\phi,\\psi) = \\theta_{\\mathrm{ref}} + t \\sin(\\phi_{\\mathrm{rad}}) \\sin(\\psi_{\\mathrm{rad}}) $$\nHere, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{rad}}$ and $\\psi_{\\mathrm{rad}}$ are the angles converted to radians. The resulting angle $\\theta$ is in degrees.\n\n**3. Environmentally-Modulated Force Constant**\nThe strength of the hydrogen bond affects the N-H bond's force constant, $k$. A stronger hydrogen bond (typically shorter $r$ and $\\theta$ closer to $180^\\circ$) weakens the N-H covalent bond, reducing its force constant. This effect is modeled by subtracting a perturbation, $\\Delta k$, from a baseline force constant, $k_0$.\n$$ \\Delta k(r,\\theta) = A\\, e^{-B r} \\left( 1 + C \\cos(\\theta_{\\mathrm{rad}}) \\right) $$\nThe effective force constant is then:\n$$ k(\\phi,\\psi) = k_0 - \\Delta k(r(\\phi,\\psi), \\theta(\\phi,\\psi)) $$\nHere, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{rad}}$ is the angle $\\theta$ converted to radians.\n\n**4. Unperturbed Wavenumbers**\nWith the effective force constant $k$ and reduced mass $\\mu$, the unperturbed wavenumber of the N-H stretching vibration, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{stretch}}$, is calculated from Hooke's law:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{stretch}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c'} \\sqrt{\\frac{k(\\phi,\\psi)}{\\mu}} $$\nSimilarly, the amide N-H bending vibration is influenced by the hydrogen bond. The problem provides an empirical model for its unperturbed wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{bend}}$, which depends on the distance $r$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{bend}}(r) = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{bend},0} - \\delta\\, e^{-\\gamma r} $$\n\n**5. Fermi Resonance and Diagonalization**\nThe N-H stretching fundamental ($\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{stretch}}$) can couple with the first overtone of the N-H bending vibration ($2\\,\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{bend}}$) if they have similar energies. This interaction, known as Fermi resonance, is modeled using a $2 \\times 2$ Hamiltonian matrix in the basis of the unperturbed states:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{stretch}}  \\phi_c \\\\ \\phi_c  2\\,\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{bend}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe diagonal elements are the energies (in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) of the unperturbed states, and the off-diagonal element $\\phi_c$ is the coupling strength. The observable spectral bands, amide A and amide B, correspond to the eigenvalues of this matrix. As $H$ is a real symmetric matrix, its eigenvalues are real and can be found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$. This yields:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{(\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{stretch}} + 2\\,\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{bend}}) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{stretch}} - 2\\,\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{bend}})^2 + 4\\phi_c^2}}{2} $$\nBy convention, the amide A band is the higher frequency band, and amide B is the lower frequency band:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{A} = \\lambda_{+} \\quad \\text{(the larger eigenvalue)} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{B} = \\lambda_{-} \\quad \\text{(the smaller eigenvalue)} $$\n\n**6. Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD)**\nFinally, the accuracy of the model is assessed by comparing the calculated wavenumbers ($\\tilde{\\nu}_{A}, \\tilde{\\nu}_{B}$) with the provided experimental values ($\\tilde{\\nu}_{A}^{\\mathrm{exp}}, \\tilde{\\nu}_{B}^{\\mathrm{exp}}$). The RMSD provides a single metric for the average deviation:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\tilde{\\nu}_{A} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{A}^{\\mathrm{exp}})^2 + (\\tilde{\\nu}_{B} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{B}^{\\mathrm{exp}})^2}{2}} $$\nThis entire procedure is repeated for each test case to generate a list of RMSD values.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the RMSD between predicted and experimental amide A/B wavenumbers\n    for a set of dipeptide conformations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define constants and model parameters\n    m_H = 1.6735575e-27  # kg\n    m_N = 2.3258671e-26  # kg\n    c_prime = 2.99792458e10  # cm/s\n    k0 = 640.0             # N/m\n\n    # Conformational mapping parameters\n    r_ref = 3.2            # Angstrom\n    d = 0.5                # Angstrom\n    theta_ref = 150.0      # degrees\n    t = 20.0               # degrees\n\n    # Force constant model parameters\n    A = 200.0              # N/m\n    B = 0.8                # 1/Angstrom\n    C = 0.2                # dimensionless\n\n    # Bending mode model parameters\n    nu_bend_0 = 1550.0     # cm^-1\n    delta = 50.0           # cm^-1\n    gamma = 1.0            # 1/Angstrom\n\n    # Calculate constant reduced mass for N-H bond\n    mu = (m_H * m_N) / (m_H + m_N)\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (phi, psi, phi_c, nu_A_exp, nu_B_exp)\n        (-60.0, -45.0, 35.0, 3268.0, 3086.5),\n        (-120.0, 140.0, 45.0, 3270.0, 3084.0),\n        (180.0, 180.0, 25.0, 3254.0, 3088.0),\n        (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 3250.0, 3093.0),\n        (180.0, 0.0, 40.0, 3288.0, 3090.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        phi_deg, psi_deg, phi_c, nu_A_exp, nu_B_exp = case\n\n        # Step 2: Conformational mapping\n        # Convert angles from degrees to radians for numpy trig functions\n        phi_rad = np.deg2rad(phi_deg)\n        psi_rad = np.deg2rad(psi_deg)\n\n        r = r_ref - d * np.cos(phi_rad) * np.cos(psi_rad)\n        theta_deg = theta_ref + t * np.sin(phi_rad) * np.sin(psi_rad)\n\n        # Step 3: Environment-modulated force constant\n        theta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n        delta_k = A * np.exp(-B * r) * (1 + C * np.cos(theta_rad))\n        k_eff = k0 - delta_k\n\n        # Step 4: Unperturbed wavenumbers\n        # N-H stretch from Hooke's law\n        nu_stretch = (1 / (2 * np.pi * c_prime)) * np.sqrt(k_eff / mu)\n        \n        # N-H bend from empirical model\n        nu_bend = nu_bend_0 - delta * np.exp(-gamma * r)\n\n        # Step 5: Fermi resonance Hamiltonian and diagonalization\n        H = np.array([\n            [nu_stretch, phi_c],\n            [phi_c, 2 * nu_bend]\n        ])\n        \n        # Eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix H\n        # numpy.linalg.eigvalsh returns eigenvalues in ascending order\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvalsh(H)\n        nu_B = eigenvalues[0]  # Smaller eigenvalue\n        nu_A = eigenvalues[1]  # Larger eigenvalue\n\n        # Step 6: Compute Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD)\n        rmsd = np.sqrt(((nu_A - nu_A_exp)**2 + (nu_B - nu_B_exp)**2) / 2)\n        \n        # Round to three decimal places and append to results\n        results.append(round(rmsd, 3))\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3714358"}]}
