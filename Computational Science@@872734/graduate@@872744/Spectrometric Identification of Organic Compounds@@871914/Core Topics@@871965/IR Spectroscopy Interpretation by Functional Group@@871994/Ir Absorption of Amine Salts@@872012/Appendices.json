Treat each N–H bond as a local diatomic harmonic oscillator embedded in the polyatomic cation, and assume that isotopic substitution of hydrogen by deuterium does not change the local force constant of the N–H stretch or the local environment to first order. Starting from the diatomic harmonic oscillator expression for the fundamental vibrational wavenumber in terms of the force constant and the reduced mass, derive the mass-scaling relation for the stretching wavenumber upon isotopic substitution.

The problem statement provides all necessary data: the initial N–H stretching wavenumber ($\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–H}} = 3200\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$), the relevant isotopic masses ($m(^{14}\\mathrm{N})$, $m(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$, $m(^{2}\\mathrm{H})$), and the model to be used (diatomic harmonic oscillator with a constant force constant upon substitution). The problem is a standard textbook exercise in physical chemistry/spectroscopy and is entirely valid.\n\nThe fundamental vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, of a diatomic harmonic oscillator is given by the expression:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the system. The wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is related to the frequency by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Thus, the wavenumber can be expressed as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nApplying this model to the N–H and N–D bonds treated as local diatomic oscillators, we can write their respective wavenumbers:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–H}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{N–H}}}{\\mu_{\\text{N–H}}}} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–D}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{N–D}}}{\\mu_{\\text{N–D}}}} $$\nThe problem states that the force constant, $k$, does not change upon isotopic substitution. This is a key part of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the potential energy surface is independent of the nuclear masses. Therefore, we assume $k_{\\text{N–H}} = k_{\\text{N–D}} = k$.\n\nTo derive the mass-scaling relation, we take the ratio of the N–D wavenumber to the N–H wavenumber:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–H}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\text{N–D}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\text{N–H}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\text{N–H}}}{\\mu_{\\text{N–D}}}} $$\nThis is the desired mass-scaling relation.

Because the zero-point-energy of the N-D bond is lower than that of the N-H bond, the N-D bond vibration samples a more harmonic region of the true potential energy surface. Since anharmonicity generally lowers the observed fundamental frequency relative to the harmonic prediction, this effect is more pronounced for the N-H oscillator than for the N-D oscillator, meaning the simple scaling calculation (which uses the anharmonically-lowered N-H frequency) will underestimate the true N-D wavenumber.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2338}$$", "id": "3708801"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple identification, infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool for quantitative analysis.

Integrating over the absorption band from wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_1$ to $\\tilde{\\nu}_2$ gives:\n$$ S = \\int_{\\tilde{\\nu}_1}^{\\tilde{\\nu}_2} A(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,d\\tilde{\\nu} = \\int_{\\tilde{\\nu}_1}^{\\tilde{\\nu}_2} \\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,b\\,c\\,d\\tilde{\\nu} $$\nSince the path length $b$ and concentration $c$ are constant with respect to wavenumber, they can be taken out of the integral:\n$$ S = b\\,c \\left( \\int_{\\tilde{\\nu}_1}^{\\tilde{\\nu}_2} \\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,d\\tilde{\\nu} \\right) $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the definition of the molar integrated absorption coefficient, $E$.\n$$ E = \\int_{\\tilde{\\nu}_1}^{\\tilde{\\nu}_2} \\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,d\\tilde{\\nu} $$\nThus, the governing equation is:\n$$ S = E \\cdot b \\cdot c $$\nThis equation shows that a plot of the integrated absorbance $S$ versus concentration $c$ should be linear, passing through the origin (since for $c=0$, $S=0$). The slope of this line, $m$, is given by:\n$$ m = \\frac{S}{c} = E \\cdot b $$\nFrom this, the molar integrated absorption coefficient $E$ can be calculated as:\n$$ E = \\frac{m}{b} $$\nTo find the slope $m$, we perform a linear least-squares regression on the provided standard data of $S$ versus $c$.\nThe data points $(c, S)$ are:\n$(0.0100, 0.303)$, $(0.0200, 0.598)$, $(0.0300, 0.904)$, $(0.0400, 1.196)$.\nLet $x_i = c_i$ and $y_i = S_i$.

A two-band N–H stretch pattern with separation on the order of tens of $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ whose higher-frequency member shifts in tandem with the weak band near $2\\nu_b$ as the counterion changes, while the lower-frequency member remains comparatively anchored; the weak band near $2\\nu_b$ gains intensity as it approaches the stretching region and loses intensity as it detunes. Confirmation is obtained by demonstrating that the position of the higher-frequency stretch component co-varies with the overtone’s position and intensity, consistent with an avoided crossing between $\\nu_s$ and $2\\nu_b$.\n\nB. A permanent, temperature- and counterion-independent splitting of the N–H stretch region into two bands separated by approximately $200\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, assigned to symmetric and asymmetric N–H stretching modes; confirmation is obtained if the weak feature near $2\\nu_b$ remains fixed while the stretch bands move with changing environment.\n\nC. A single broad N–H stretch band that narrows upon cooling, with no resolvable splitting; confirmation is obtained if the bending fundamental is observed at exactly half of the N–H stretch frequency, demonstrating a simple integer relationship.\n\nD. A three-peak pattern in the N–H stretch region ascribed to simultaneous coupling to the bending overtone and to a lattice mode of the counterion; confirmation is obtained if the overtone near $2\\nu_b$ weakens in intensity when its frequency approaches the stretch region, indicating destructive interference between coupled states.", "solution": "The fundamental base is the anharmonic oscillator description of vibrational energy levels and the general mechanism of Fermi resonance. In the Morse oscillator model, vibrational levels are given approximately by\n$$\nE_v \\approx \\hbar \\omega_e \\left(v + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) - \\hbar \\omega_e x_e \\left(v + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^2,\n$$\nso that overtones occur at frequencies slightly less than integer multiples of the fundamental due to anharmonicity. When a bright fundamental of frequency $\\nu_s$ lies close to an overtone or combination frequency such as $2\\nu_b$ of a bending mode, anharmonic coupling mixes the zero-order states, producing two new eigenstates that are linear combinations of the stretch and overtone. This is the essence of Fermi resonance.\n\nThe simplest treatment uses a two-level Hamiltonian in the diabatic basis $\\{\\lvert s \\rangle, \\lvert 2b \\rangle\\}$,\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\nu_s & V \\\\\nV & 2\\nu_b\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the anharmonic coupling matrix element and $\\nu_s$ and $2\\nu_b$ are the zero-order frequencies. The observed eigenfrequencies are\n$$\n\\nu_{\\pm} = \\frac{\\nu_s + 2\\nu_b}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\nu_s - 2\\nu_b}{2}\\right)^2 + V^2}.\n$$\nThis produces level repulsion (avoided crossing): as the detuning $\\Delta \\equiv \\nu_s - 2\\nu_b$ is varied by changing environment (e.g., counterion or temperature), the two observed bands move apart when $\\lvert \\Delta \\rvert$ is small and approach their zero-order values when $\\lvert \\Delta \\rvert$ is large. The eigenvectors determine intensity borrowing: the overtone gains intensity from the fundamental near resonance, so the weaker partner becomes stronger and vice versa, with the intensity partition governed by a mixing angle $\\theta$ defined through $\\tan 2\\theta = 2V/\\Delta$.\n\nApplying this to protonated amines, the bending fundamental $\\nu_b$ often lies near $1550$–$1650\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and its overtone $2\\nu_b$ (reduced by anharmonicity) can lie near the N–H stretching region $\\sim 3000$–$3150\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Thus, an ammonium salt may show a doublet in the N–H stretching region due to Fermi resonance. The signature involves two frequencies whose separation and relative intensities depend systematically on the proximity of $2\\nu_b$ to $\\nu_s$, and a weak overtone band whose position co-varies with the higher-frequency member of the doublet if that member carries more overtone character.\n\nInterpreting the provided observations, in the $\\mathrm{X^-}$ sample at temperature $T_1$, there are two N–H bands at $3066\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $3112\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and a very weak feature near $3108\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The bending fundamental is at $\\nu_b = 1583\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, so $2\\cdot \\nu_b = 3166\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ in the harmonic limit, but anharmonicity lowers the overtone to near $3108\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, close to the higher member of the doublet. In the $\\mathrm{Y^-}$ sample, $\\nu_b$ increases to $1607\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, so the anharmonic overtone moves higher, consistent with the weak band near $3130\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and the higher-frequency N–H component moves up to $3128\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, while the lower-frequency component remains near $3072\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This is precisely the avoided crossing picture: one component (with more overtone character) tracks the overtone $2\\nu_b$ as it shifts; the other (with more stretch character) remains relatively fixed if $\\nu_s$ is less sensitive to the environmental change.\n\nThe confirmation strategy “by tracking the bending overtone” is then to correlate the motion and intensity of the weak overtone band with one member of the N–H doublet as $\\nu_b$ is perturbed (by changing counterion, temperature, or hydrogen-bonding environment). Near resonance (small $\\lvert \\Delta \\rvert$), the overtone gains intensity and the splitting increases to approximately $2\\lvert V \\rvert$ when $\\Delta \\approx 0$. As the overtone detunes, its intensity decreases and the doublet components approach their zero-order positions. Observing such co-variation of positions and intensities constitutes strong evidence of Fermi resonance.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option describes a two-band N–H stretch with separation of tens of $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, with the higher-frequency member shifting in tandem with the weak overtone as the counterion changes, while the lower-frequency member stays relatively fixed. It further specifies an intensity increase of the weak overtone as it approaches the stretch region and a decrease as it moves away. This is exactly the expected spectral signature of Fermi resonance from the two-level model with avoided crossing and intensity borrowing. The data given ($3066/3112\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ alongside a weak $3108\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ band, shifting to $3072/3128\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ with a weak band at $3130\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ as $\\nu_b$ increases) are consistent: the higher-frequency component tracks the overtone, the lower-frequency component tracks the fundamental. Confirmation by co-variation of positions and intensities directly implements “tracking the bending overtone.” Correct.\n\nB. A counterion- and temperature-independent splitting of about $200\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ assigned to symmetric and asymmetric stretches is not a Fermi resonance signature. Fermi resonance typically produces splittings on the order of tens of $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and its magnitude varies with detuning. Moreover, the overtone should not remain fixed while the stretch bands move; the opposite co-variation is expected for coupled levels. Incorrect.\n\nC. A single broad N–H band that simply narrows upon cooling, with confirmation via the bending fundamental at exactly half the N–H frequency, contradicts the anharmonic nature of molecular vibrations. Overtones are not exactly integer multiples of fundamentals, and Fermi resonance requires near-degeneracy and coupling, typically yielding a resolvable doublet and intensity borrowing. Incorrect.\n\nD. A three-peak pattern due to simultaneous coupling to an overtone and a lattice mode is not the standard Fermi resonance signature. Additionally, the claim that the overtone weakens as it approaches the stretch contradicts intensity borrowing, which predicts that the overtone gains intensity near resonance. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that captures both the spectral signature and the correct overtone-tracking confirmation is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3708876"}]}
