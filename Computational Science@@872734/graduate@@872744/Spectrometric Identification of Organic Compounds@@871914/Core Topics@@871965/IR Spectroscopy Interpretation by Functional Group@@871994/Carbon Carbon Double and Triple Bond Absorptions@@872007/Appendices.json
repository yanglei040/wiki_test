Do not include a percent sign in your answer.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the relationship between infrared (IR) absorption wavenumbers for carbon-carbon double bond stretches and the effect of conjugation. The analysis is to be based on the harmonic oscillator model.\n\nFirst, let us establish the fundamental principles. In the harmonic oscillator approximation, the vibrational frequency $\\nu$ of a diatomic system is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond, representing its stiffness, and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two atoms involved in the vibration.\n\nIn IR spectroscopy, it is conventional to use wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$, which is defined as the reciprocal of the wavelength $\\lambda$. The wavenumber is related to the frequency $\\nu$ by the speed of light, $c$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{c}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu$ from the harmonic oscillator model into the definition of $\\tilde{\\nu}$ gives the relationship between the observed wavenumber and the physical properties of the bond:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the absorption wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is directly proportional to the square root of the force constant $k$, assuming the reduced mass $\\mu$ and the speed of light $c$ are constant.\n\nNext, we must justify which alkene is more conjugated. Conjugation refers to the delocalization of $\\pi$-electrons in a system of alternating single and multiple bonds. This delocalization has a significant effect on bond strength. An isolated carbon-carbon double bond ($C=C$) has its $\\pi$-electron density localized between the two carbon atoms. In a conjugated system, this $\\pi$-electron density is spread over several atoms. This delocalization lowers the total energy of the molecule, making it more stable. Crucially, it also alters the character of the bonds. The nominal double bond acquires some single-bond character, making it weaker and slightly longer than an isolated double bond. Conversely, the nominal single bond acquires some double-bond character.\n\nThe force constant $k$ is a measure of bond strength. A stronger bond is stiffer and has a higher force constant. Since conjugation weakens the $C=C$ bond, it reduces the bond's force constant. According to the relationship $\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\sqrt{k}$, a lower force constant $k$ will result in a lower vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nWe are given two wavenumbers: $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1620\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1680\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Since $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}} < \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, alkene $A$, which has the lower stretching frequency, must have the weaker $C=C$ bond. Therefore, alkene $A$ is the more conjugated alkene, and alkene $B$ is the less conjugated (or unconjugated) reference.\n\nNow, we derive the relationship between the ratio of wavenumbers and the ratio of force constants. Let $k_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ be the force constants for the $C=C$ bonds in alkenes $A$ and $B$, respectively. The problem states that the reduced mass $\\mu$ is the same for both. We can write the expressions for their wavenumbers as:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\mu}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mu}}\n$$\nTaking the ratio of these two equations, the constant term $\\frac{1}{2\\pi c\\sqrt{\\mu}}$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{A}}/\\mu}}{\\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{B}}/\\mu}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives the desired relationship between the ratio of force constants and the ratio of wavenumbers:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the fractional decrease in the force constant of the more conjugated alkene ($A$) relative to the less conjugated alkene ($B$). The reference for this fractional change is the force constant of the less conjugated alkene, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$. The fractional decrease is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} - k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} = 1 - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived relationship into this expression:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right)^2\n$$\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1620\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1680\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1620}{1680}\\right)^2\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{1620}{1680} = \\frac{162}{168} = \\frac{81}{84} = \\frac{27}{28}\n$$\nSo, the calculation becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{27}{28}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{27^2}{28^2} = 1 - \\frac{729}{784}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = \\frac{784 - 729}{784} = \\frac{55}{784}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} \\approx 0.070153061...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
