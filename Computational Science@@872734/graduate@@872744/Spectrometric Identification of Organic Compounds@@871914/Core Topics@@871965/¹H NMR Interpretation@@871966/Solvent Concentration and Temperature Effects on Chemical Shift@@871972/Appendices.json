The relation is given by:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{in}} - B_{0}}{B_{0}} \\times 10^{6}\n$$\nThe problem states that any intrinsic chemical shift is constant, so the difference in measured shifts $\\Delta \\delta$ is solely the difference in the BMS contributions to the shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}, 5} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}, 3}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}, i} = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{in}, i} - B_{0}}{B_{0}} \\times 10^{6}$ for preparation $i \\in \\{3, 5\\}$.\n\nOur first step is to determine the internal magnetic field $B_{\\mathrm{in}}$ for a uniformly magnetized prolate spheroid sample oriented along the applied field. The relevant magnetostatic relations are:\n$1.$ The constitutive relation for a linear magnetic material: $M = \\chi H$, where $M$ is the magnetization, $\\chi$ is the volume magnetic susceptibility, and $H$ is the magnetic field strength.\n$2.$ The relation between magnetic flux density $B$, field strength $H$, and magnetization $M$: $B = \\mu_{0}(H + M)$, where $\\mu_{0}$ is the vacuum permeability.\n$3.$ The field inside the body, $H_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is related to the applied field, $H_{0} = B_{0}/\\mu_{0}$, and the magnetization, $M_{\\mathrm{in}}$, through the demagnetizing factor $N_{z}$ along the symmetry axis: $H_{\\mathrm{in}} = H_{0} - N_{z} M_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\n\nFrom these relations, we can solve for $H_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{in}} = H_{0} - N_{z} (\\chi H_{\\mathrm{in}}) \\implies H_{\\mathrm{in}} (1 + N_{z} \\chi) = H_{0} \\implies H_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{H_{0}}{1 + N_{z} \\chi}\n$$\nNow, we find the magnetic flux density inside the sample, $B_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_{0}(H_{\\mathrm{in}} + M_{\\mathrm{in}}) = \\mu_{0}(H_{\\mathrm{in}} + \\chi H_{\\mathrm{in}}) = \\mu_{0} H_{\\mathrm{in}} (1 + \\chi)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and using $H_{0} = B_{0}/\\mu_{0}$:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_{0} \\left( \\frac{H_{0}}{1 + N_{z} \\chi} \\right) (1 + \\chi) = B_{0} \\frac{1 + \\chi}{1 + N_{z} \\chi}\n$$\nThe problem specifies working to first order in $\\chi$, with $|\\chi| \\ll 1$.

This can be achieved either by direct measurement (e.g., using the Evans NMR method) or by calculation from the known volume fractions and susceptibilities of the pure components.\n$3.$ Using the measured geometry ($R$, $V$) and the prolate spheroid model, calculate the demagnetizing factor $N_{z}$ for each sample.\n$4.$ Calculate the geometry-dependent BMS shift contribution. The total BMS shift is $\\delta_{\\mathrm{BMS}} = (1-N_z)\\chi \\times 10^{6}$. This can be conceptually split into a geometry-independent part ($\\chi \\times 10^{6}$, corresponding to an infinite cylinder where $N_z=0$) and a geometry-dependent correction ($-N_z \\chi \\times 10^{6}$).\n$5.$ To place all data on a common scale, correct the observed chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, to a standard reference geometry, such as an infinitely long cylinder ($N_{z}=0$). The corrected chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{corr}}$, is obtained by adding back the geometry-dependent term: $\\delta_{\\mathrm{corr}} = \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} + N_{z} \\chi \\times 10^{6}$.

The populations are given by the fraction of free solute, $f_{\\mathrm{free}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{b}}$, and the fraction of bound solute, $f_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\n$$\n\\delta(T,c) = f_{\\mathrm{free}}\\,\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}\\,\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} = (1 - f_{\\mathrm{b}})\\,\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}\\,\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\delta(T,c) = \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c)\\,(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}) = \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c)\\,\\Delta \\delta\n$$\nThis matches the equation provided in the problem. We can solve this for the fraction of bound solute, $f_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c)$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c) = \\frac{\\delta(T,c) - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{\\Delta \\delta}\n$$\nThe problem also provides the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{b}}$ based on the equilibrium constant $K(T)$ and solvent concentration $c$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{b}}(T,c) = \\frac{K(T)\\,c}{1 + K(T)\\,c}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $f_{\\mathrm{b}}$ for a given measurement $i$ at temperature $T_i$ and concentration $c_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta(T_i,c_i) - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{\\Delta \\delta} = \\frac{K(T_i)\\,c_i}{1 + K(T_i)\\,c_i}\n$$\nTo solve for $K(T_i)$, let us denote $\\delta_i = \\delta(T_i,c_i)$ for simplicity.\n$$\n(\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}})(1 + K(T_i)\\,c_i) = \\Delta \\delta\\,K(T_i)\\,c_i\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + (\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}})K(T_i)\\,c_i = \\Delta \\delta\\,K(T_i)\\,c_i\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} = K(T_i)\\,c_i\\,[\\Delta \\delta - (\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}})]\n$$\n$$\nK(T_i) = \\frac{\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{c_i\\,[\\Delta \\delta - \\delta_i + \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}]}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta \\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ into the denominator:\n$$\nK(T_i) = \\frac{\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{c_i\\,[(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}) - \\delta_i + \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}]} = \\frac{\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}}{c_i\\,(\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} - \\delta_i)}\n$$\nThis expression provides $K(T_i)$ in terms of the measured chemical shift $\\delta_i$, the known parameters $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ (where $\\delta_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\delta_{\\mathrm{free}} + \\Delta \\delta$), and the concentration $c_i$.\n\n2. Enthalpy change $\\Delta H$ from a two-point measurement\n\nThe van’t Hoff relation is given as $\\ln K(T) = \\frac{\\Delta S}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H}{R T}$.\nDefining $y = \\ln K(T)$ and $x = 1/T$, the equation takes the linear form $y = mx + b$, where the slope is $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{R}$ and the intercept is $b = \\frac{\\Delta S}{R}$.\nFor two measurements $(T_1, K_1)$ and $(T_2, K_2)$, we have two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, where $x_i = 1/T_i$ and $y_i = \\ln K_i$.\nThe slope $m$ can be estimated using the two-point formula:\n$$\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{\\ln K_2 - \\ln K_1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1}\n$$\nFrom the relation $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{R}$, we can express the standard enthalpy change $\\Delta H$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta H = -R\\,m = -R\\,\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\n3. Derivation of the standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{\\Delta H}$\n\nThe standard uncertainty in $\\Delta H$ is obtained by applying the law of propagation of uncertainty for independent variables. The function is $\\Delta H(T_1, T_2, c_1, c_2)$. The uncertainties in $\\delta_{\\mathrm{free}}$ and $\\Delta \\delta$ are negligible, so the measured shifts $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are treated as exact values for this derivation. The variables with uncertainty are $T_1, T_2, c_1, c_2$.\nThe variance $\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T_1}\\right)^2\\sigma_{T_1}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T_2}\\right)^2\\sigma_{T_2}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial c_1}\\right)^2\\sigma_{c_1}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial c_2}\\right)^2\\sigma_{c_2}^2\n$$\nWe need to calculate the partial derivatives of $\\Delta H = -R\\,\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1}$.\nFirst, we find the dependence of $y_i = \\ln K_i$ on $c_i$. Based on Part 1, $K_i$ is inversely proportional to $c_i$: $K_i = A_i/c_i$, where $A_i = \\frac{\\delta_i - \\delta_{\\text{free}}}{\\delta_{\\text{bound}} - \\delta_i}$ is a constant with respect to $c_i$.\nSo, $y_i = \\ln(A_i/c_i) = \\ln(A_i) - \\ln(c_i)$.\nThe partial derivatives of $y_i$ with respect to $c_i$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial c_1} = -\\frac{1}{c_1}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial c_2} = -\\frac{1}{c_2}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $\\Delta H$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial c_1} = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial y_1}\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial c_1} = \\left(-R\\,\\frac{-1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{c_1}\\right) = -R\\,\\frac{T_1 T_2}{c_1(T_1 - T_2)}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial c_2} = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial y_2}\\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial c_2} = \\left(-R\\,\\frac{1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{c_2}\\right) = R\\,\\frac{T_1 T_2}{c_2(T_1 - T_2)}\n$$\nFor the derivatives with respect to temperature, we can rewrite $\\Delta H = -R(y_2 - y_1)\\frac{T_1 T_2}{T_1 - T_2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T_1} = -R(y_2-y_1)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_1}\\left(\\frac{T_1T_2}{T_1-T_2}\\right) = -R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_2(T_1-T_2) - T_1T_2(1)}{(T_1-T_2)^2} = -R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{-T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2} = R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\n$$\nBy symmetry (or direct calculation), swapping indices $1$ and $2$ gives an overall sign change from $(y_2 - y_1) \\to (y_1 - y_2)$, and also changes $T_2^2 \\to T_1^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T_2} = -R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_1^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\n$$\nSquaring these partial derivatives and substituting into the variance formula:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2 = \\left(R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\\right)^2\\sigma_{T_1}^2 + \\left(-R(y_2-y_1)\\frac{T_1^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\\right)^2\\sigma_{T_2}^2 + \\left(-R\\,\\frac{T_1 T_2}{c_1(T_1 - T_2)}\\right)^2\\sigma_{c_1}^2 + \\left(R\\,\\frac{T_1 T_2}{c_2(T_1 - T_2)}\\right)^2\\sigma_{c_2}^2\n$$\nThis can be factored to give the closed-form expression for $\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta H}^2 = R^2 \\frac{(y_2-y_1)^2}{(T_1-T_2)^4}(T_2^4\\sigma_{T_1}^2 + T_1^4\\sigma_{T_2}^2) + R^2 \\frac{T_1^2 T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{c_1}^2}{c_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{c_2}^2}{c_2^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{\\Delta H}$ is the square root of this expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta H} = R\\sqrt{\\frac{(y_2-y_1)^2}{(T_1-T_2)^4}(T_2^4\\sigma_{T_1}^2 + T_1^4\\sigma_{T_2}^2) + \\frac{T_1^2 T_2^2}{(T_1-T_2)^2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{c_1}^2}{c_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{c_2}^2}{c_2^2}\\right)}\n$$\n\n4.
