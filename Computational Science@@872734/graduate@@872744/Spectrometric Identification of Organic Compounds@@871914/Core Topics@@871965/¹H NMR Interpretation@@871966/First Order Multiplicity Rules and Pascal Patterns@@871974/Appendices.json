A common rule of thumb in NMR spectroscopy is that the ratio `|\\Delta\\nu/J|` should be greater than `10` for the first-order approximation to hold well. A value of `|\\Delta\\nu/J| \\approx 6.67` indicates that the system is not in the weak-coupling limit. Instead, it is in an \"intermediate coupling\" regime. While the signals will still be split into doublets, their relative intensities will deviate from the `1:1` ratio predicted by Pascal's triangle, and their chemical shifts will be slightly perturbed from their true values.

The center of the multiplet is defined as the position of the resonance without coupling, which we can set to an offset of $0$. The separation between any two adjacent lines in the multiplet is the coupling constant $J$. For a multiplet with an even number of lines (a quartet has $4$), the pattern is symmetric about the center, but no line appears at the center itself. The two innermost lines are separated by $J$ and are centered at $\\pm \\frac{J}{2}$.

This scenario is known as complex or product splitting. Since the couplings are independent, we can determine the final multiplet pattern by considering the splittings sequentially.\n\n1.  **Splitting by the first set of neighbors ($n_{1}=3$):**\n    A single resonance coupled to $n_{1}=3$ equivalent spin-1/2 nuclei is split into a multiplet with a number of lines given by the $(n+1)$ rule:\n    Number of lines = $n_{1}+1 = 3+1 = 4$. This multiplet is a quartet.\n\n    The relative intensities of these four lines are given by the binomial coefficients $\\binom{n_{1}}{k}$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3$. This corresponds to the 3rd row of Pascal's triangle (where the top row is row 0).\n    - Intensity of line 1: $\\binom{3}{0} = \\frac{3!}{0!(3-0)!} = 1$\n    - Intensity of line 2: $\\binom{3}{1} = \\frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = 3$\n    - Intensity of line 3: $\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = 3$\n    - Intensity of line 4: $\\binom{3}{3} = \\frac{3!}{3!(3-3)!} = 1$\n    So, the initial splitting by the $n_{1}=3$ protons produces a quartet with a relative intensity pattern of $1:3:3:1$. The separation between adjacent lines in this quartet is $J_{1}$.\n\n2.  **Splitting by the second set of neighbors ($n_{2}=2$):**\n    Each of the four lines from the quartet is further split by the $n_{2}=2$ equivalent spin-1/2 nuclei. The number of lines for this secondary splitting is:\n    Number of sub-lines = $n_{2}+1 = 2+1 = 3$. This forms a triplet.\n\n    The relative intensities within this triplet pattern are given by the binomial coefficients $\\binom{n_{2}}{k}$ for $k=0, 1, 2$. This corresponds to the 2nd row of Pascal's triangle.\n    - Intensity of sub-line 1: $\\binom{2}{0} = \\frac{2!}{0!(2-0)!} = 1$\n    - Intensity of sub-line 2: $\\binom{2}{1} = \\frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = 2$\n    - Intensity of sub-line 3: $\\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1$\n    So, the secondary splitting pattern for each line is a triplet with a relative intensity pattern of $1:2:1$. The separation between adjacent lines within each triplet is $J_{2}$.\n\n3.  **Total number of lines:**\n    Since each of the $4$ lines from the first splitting is further split into $3$ lines, the total number of lines in the final multiplet is the product of the individual multiplicities:\n    Total lines = $(n_{1}+1) \\times (n_{2}+1) = (3+1) \\times (2+1) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n    The problem assumes no accidental degeneracies (line overlaps), which is standard for $J_{1} \\neq J_{2}$ unless they are simple integer multiples of each other, and the explicit ordering instruction confirms we should treat them as fully resolved groups.\n\n4.  **Ordered sequence of relative intensities:**\n    The problem specifies that $|J_{1}| > |J_{2}|$ and that the ordering is determined by the $J_{1}$ quartet first. This describes a \"quartet of triplets\", where the spectrum consists of four distinct groups of lines (the quartet), and each group is a triplet. To find the ordered intensity pattern (in ascending frequency), we apply the triplet intensity pattern ($1:2:1$) to each line of the quartet pattern ($1:3:3:1$) sequentially.\n\n    - The first line of the quartet (relative intensity $1$) is split into a triplet. The intensities of this first group of lines are $1 \\times (1:2:1) = 1:2:1$.\n    - The second line of the quartet (relative intensity $3$) is split into a triplet. The intensities of this second group are $3 \\times (1:2:1) = 3:6:3$.\n    - The third line of the quartet (relative intensity $3$) is also split into a triplet. The intensities of this third group are $3 \\times (1:2:1) = 3:6:3$.\n    - The fourth line of the quartet (relative intensity $1$) is split into a triplet. The intensities of this fourth group are $1 \\times (1:2:1) = 1:2:1$.\n\n    Since $|J_{1}|$ is larger than the total width of the triplet splitting (which is $2|J_{2}|$, as implied by the problem's ordering instruction), there is no overlap between these groups of triplets. The final ordered sequence of intensities, from lowest frequency to highest frequency, is obtained by concatenating the intensities of these four groups:\n    Sequence = ($1, 2, 1$), then ($3, 6, 3$), then ($3, 6, 3$), then ($1, 2, 1$).\n    The full ordered sequence is $1, 2, 1, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 2, 1$.\n\n    As-a-check, the sum of these relative intensities is $1+2+1+3+6+3+3+6+3+1+2+1 = 32$. This matches the expected total intensity, which is the product of the sums of the individual patterns: $(\\sum_{k=0}^{3} \\binom{3}{k}) \\times (\\sum_{k=0}^{2} \\binom{2}{k}) = 2^{3} \\times 2^{2} = 8 \\times 4 = 32$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the total number of lines followed by the ordered sequence of intensities.\n- Total lines: $12$\n- Ordered intensities: $1, 2, 1, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 2, 1$\nThis combines into the required matrix format.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n12 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 6 & 3 & 3 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3702203"}]}
