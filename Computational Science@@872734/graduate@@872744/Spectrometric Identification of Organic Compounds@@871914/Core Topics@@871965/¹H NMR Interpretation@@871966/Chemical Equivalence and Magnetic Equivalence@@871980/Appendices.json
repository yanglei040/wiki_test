In such a medium, the spectroscopic Hamiltonian is invariant under any spatial symmetry operation that maps a molecule to an indistinguishable configuration in an achiral environment, and chemical equivalence of nuclei is determined by whether there exists a symmetry operation of space that interconverts the nuclei while leaving the energy unchanged. Two sites are called enantiotopic if they are interconverted by an improper symmetry operation (e.g., mirror reflection or inversion) that transforms the molecule into its mirror image; two sites are called diastereotopic if replacing one site with a distinguishable label produces a diastereomer rather than an enantiomer of the product obtained by replacing the other site.\n\nConsider the two hydrogen nuclei of the methylene group $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ in ethanol. Determine whether these two methylene hydrogens are enantiotopic or diastereotopic in an achiral isotropic solution, and justify your choice by explicitly stating a symmetry operation of space that interconverts them. Additionally, reason from first principles whether, under the stated conditions, these two hydrogens are expected to be magnetically equivalent (i.e., have identical scalar couplings to all other spins in the spin system).\n\nChoose the best statement:\n\nA.

In an achiral isotropic solution with rapid internal rotation, they are chemically equivalent and magnetically equivalent, forming an $A_2$ set that yields a single resonance.\n\nB. The two methylene hydrogens are diastereotopic; because $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\mathrm{OH}$ are different substituents, only a proper rotation $C_2$ about the $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!C}$ bond can swap the hydrogens, and the resulting configurations are not indistinguishable in an achiral medium. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent and give two distinct resonances.\n\nC. The two methylene hydrogens are homotopic; a proper rotation $C_2$ exists within a single ethanol conformer that leaves the entire molecule invariant while swapping the hydrogens. Hence, they are both chemically and magnetically equivalent.\n\nD. The two methylene hydrogens are enantiotopic; they are interconverted by inversion $i$ through the methylene carbon, but in solution they are magnetically non-equivalent because they have different three-bond scalar couplings $^3J_{HH}$ to the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ hydrogens arising from anisotropic conformational preferences.", "solution": "The starting point is the symmetry-based definitions tied to the spectroscopic Hamiltonian in isotropic, achiral solution:\n\n- Chemical equivalence arises when two nuclei are related by a symmetry operation of space that maps the molecule to an indistinguishable configuration in an achiral environment, ensuring identical local electronic environments on the NMR timescale.\n- Enantiotopic sites are interconverted by improper symmetry operations (mirror reflection $\\sigma$ or inversion $i$) that transform the molecule to its mirror image; in an achiral medium, the mirror image is indistinguishable, so enantiotopic sites are chemically equivalent.\n- Diastereotopic sites are interconverted such that substitution at one site versus the other yields diastereomeric products; these are not generally indistinguishable in an achiral medium and are chemically non-equivalent.\n- Magnetic equivalence requires not only identical chemical shifts but identical scalar couplings to all other spins in the spin system. Two chemically equivalent nuclei can be magnetically non-equivalent if their couplings to other nuclei differ; however, if their couplings are identical, they are magnetically equivalent (an $A_n$ set).\n\nApply the substitution test and symmetry operations to ethanol $\\mathrm{CH_3\\!-\\!CH_2\\!-\\!OH}$. Label the methylene hydrogens $\\mathrm{H_a}$ and $\\mathrm{H_b}$. Consider replacing $\\mathrm{H_a}$ with a label $X$ to generate $\\mathrm{CH_3\\!-\\!CH(X)\\!-\\!OH}$, and separately replacing $\\mathrm{H_b}$ with $X$ to generate $\\mathrm{CH_3\\!-\\!CH(X)\\!-\\!OH}$. The central carbon now has substituents $\\mathrm{CH_3}$, $\\mathrm{OH}$, $\\mathrm{H}$, and $X$, which are four different groups. Each substituted molecule possesses a stereogenic center at the former methylene carbon. The two replacement products are related as mirror images: a mirror reflection through a plane $\\sigma$ that contains the methylene carbon and the $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!C\\!-\\!O}$ axis and bisects the $\\mathrm{H\\!-\\!C\\!-\\!H}$ angle swaps $\\mathrm{H_a}$ and $\\mathrm{H_b}$ while interchanging the positions of $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\mathrm{OH}$, generating the mirror image configuration of the substituted molecule. Therefore, the two products are enantiomers, and in the parent ethanol the two methylene hydrogens are enantiotopic.\n\nBecause the medium is achiral and isotropic, and the spectrometer averages over fast internal rotations about $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!C}$ and $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!O}$ single bonds on the NMR timescale, the mirror-related environments experienced by $\\mathrm{H_a}$ and $\\mathrm{H_b}$ are indistinguishable. Hence, they are chemically equivalent in solution. For magnetic equivalence, examine scalar couplings: each methylene hydrogen has three-bond couplings $^3J_{HH}$ to the three methyl hydrogens, and by symmetry and conformational averaging these couplings are the same for $\\mathrm{H_a}$ and $\\mathrm{H_b}$. The geminal two-bond coupling $^2J_{HH}$ between the two methylene hydrogens does not manifest as splitting when the spins are equivalent in the spectrum. Coupling to the hydroxyl proton is typically averaged to near zero in protic solvents due to rapid exchange. Consequently, the set of couplings to all other spins is identical for the two methylene hydrogens, and they are magnetically equivalent, forming an $A_2$ spin set that yields a single resonance for $\\mathrm{CH_2}$, typically observed as splitting only by the neighboring $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. States enantiotopic relationship and identifies an explicit mirror reflection $\\sigma$ that passes through the methylene carbon and the $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!C\\!-\\!O}$ axis and bisects the $\\mathrm{H\\!-\\!C\\!-\\!H}$ angle. This operation swaps the two methylene hydrogens and converts ethanol to its mirror image, which is indistinguishable in an achiral medium. The reasoning on chemical equivalence and magnetic equivalence under isotropic, fast-rotating conditions is consistent. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Claims diastereotopicity and invokes a proper rotation $C_2$ as the only way to swap hydrogens. Proper rotations that would leave the molecule invariant do not exist for ethanol in a single conformer because $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\mathrm{OH}$ are not symmetry-related substituents, and the substitution test yields enantiomers, not diastereomers. In achiral isotropic solution, the methylene hydrogens are chemically equivalent, not giving two distinct resonances. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Claims homotopicity via a proper $C_2$ rotation that leaves ethanol invariant while swapping the hydrogens. Ethanol does not possess such a molecular symmetry element; swapping methylene hydrogens necessarily transforms substituent arrangement into a mirror image, not the same molecule. The substitution test shows the resulting products are enantiomers, not the identical compound, so the hydrogens are not homotopic. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Correctly asserts enantiotopic interconversion but incorrectly attributes it specifically to inversion $i$ through the methylene carbon (a tetrahedral carbon does not furnish a genuine inversion center for the molecule), and more importantly, claims magnetic non-equivalence due to different $^3J_{HH}$ couplings to $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ hydrogens. In achiral isotropic solution with conformational averaging, these couplings are identical for the two methylene hydrogens; hence they are magnetically equivalent.

Consequently, $H_2$ and $H_6$ are chemically equivalent, and $H_3$ and $H_5$ are chemically equivalent; however, $H_2/H_6$ are not chemically equivalent to $H_3/H_5$ because their positions relative to the methyl groups and to the ring framework differ.\n\nTo establish magnetic equivalence, we must compare the scalar coupling networks.

Asserts two chemically equivalent pairs that are magnetically equivalent within each pair, yielding two first-order doublets. As shown, within each pair $J_{ik}\\neq J_{jk}$ for specific $k$ (e.g., $J_{23}\\neq J_{63}$), so magnetic equivalence fails. First-order doublets are not expected; second-order behavior occurs.

The concepts of chemical shift ($\\delta$), Larmor frequency ($\\nu_0$), scalar coupling ($J$), and the distinction between first-order and second-order spectra are central to the field. The relationship $\\Delta\\nu = \\nu_0 \\Delta\\delta$ and the field-independence of $J$ are cornerstones of NMR theory.

A solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem describes a two-spin system, which, in NMR nomenclature, is denoted as AX when it is first-order and AB when it is second-order. The degree of second-order character is determined by the ratio of the chemical shift difference in Hertz ($\\Delta\\nu$) to the scalar coupling constant ($J$).\n\n### Analysis at the Initial Field ($400$ MHz)\n\n1.  **Calculate the Ratio $\\Delta\\nu/J$**:\n    We are given $\\Delta\\nu = 30$ Hz and $J = 10$ Hz. The ratio is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{J} = \\frac{30 \\text{ Hz}}{10 \\text{ Hz}} = 3\n    $$\n\n2.  **Classify the Spectrum**:\n    The provided information states that second-order effects are appreciable when $\\Delta\\nu/J$ is \"small (on the order of unity)\". A ratio of $3$ is small enough that significant deviation from first-order behavior is expected. Therefore, the spin system is an AB system, and the spectrum is a second-order pattern, specifically an AB quartet.\n\n3.  **Predict Spectral Appearance**:\n    A key feature of a second-order AB quartet is the non-uniformity of line intensities. The two lines closer to the center of the multiplet (the \"inner\" lines) become more intense, and the two \"outer\" lines become less intense. This phenomenon is known as \"roofing\" or \"leaning,\" as the intensity pattern appears to lean inward toward the midpoint of the two chemical shifts. At $\\Delta\\nu/J = 3$, this roofing effect is pronounced. The pattern consists of four lines, none of which correspond to the true chemical shifts, and their intensities are unequal.\n\n4.  **Determine Equivalence**:\n    The problem states $\\Delta\\nu = 30$ Hz, which implies a non-zero chemical shift difference, $\\Delta\\delta \\neq 0$. According to the provided definitions, nuclei with different chemical shifts are chemically non-equivalent. The definitions also state that if spins are chemically non-equivalent ($\\Delta\\delta \\neq 0$), they cannot be magnetically equivalent. Thus, the two hydrogen nuclei are chemically non-equivalent and magnetically non-equivalent.\n\n### Analysis at the Higher Field ($800$ MHz)\n\n1.  **Calculate New Parameters ($\\Delta\\nu'$ and $J'$)**:\n    -   The spectrometer frequency, $\\nu_0$, is doubled from $400$ MHz to $800$ MHz.\n    -   The chemical shift difference in ppm, $\\Delta\\delta$, is an intrinsic molecular property and is independent of the magnetic field.\n    -   The chemical shift difference in Hertz, $\\Delta\\nu$, is directly proportional to the field strength: $\\Delta\\nu = \\nu_0 \\Delta\\delta$. Since $\\nu_0$ doubles, $\\Delta\\nu$ must also double.\n    $$\n    \\Delta\\nu' = (800 \\text{ MHz}) \\Delta\\delta = (2 \\times 400 \\text{ MHz}) \\Delta\\delta = 2 \\times (\\Delta\\nu_{400\\text{MHz}}) = 2 \\times 30 \\text{ Hz} = 60 \\text{ Hz}\n    $$\n    -   The scalar coupling constant, $J$, is stated to be \"essentially independent of magnetic field strength.\" Therefore, it remains unchanged.\n    $$\n    J' = J = 10 \\text{ Hz}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the New Ratio $\\Delta\\nu'/J'$**:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\Delta\\nu'}{J'} = \\frac{60 \\text{ Hz}}{10 \\text{ Hz}} = 6\n    $$\n\n3.  **Predict Changes in Spectral Appearance**:\n    By increasing the magnetic field, the ratio $\\Delta\\nu/J$ has increased from $3$ to $6$. As this ratio becomes larger, the system approaches the first-order limit. The second-order effects, such as roofing, will diminish. The AB quartet will evolve to look more like an AX pattern. An AX pattern consists of two distinct doublets, one for each nucleus. The lines within each doublet should have an intensity ratio approaching $1{:}1$, and the center of each doublet will be very close to the true chemical shift of the corresponding nucleus. The description \"almost first-order doublet with approximately $1{:}1$ line intensities\" is an accurate qualitative description for this state.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate Equivalence**:\n    The chemical shift difference $\\Delta\\delta$ remains non-zero. Therefore, the nuclei remain chemically non-equivalent and, consequently, magnetically non-equivalent. The classification of the spins does not change with the magnetic field strength.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

It reverses the actual dependencies: $J$ is field-independent, while $\\Delta\\nu$ is field-dependent.\n-   Consequently, the conclusion that second-order distortions increase is also incorrect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3695793"}]}
