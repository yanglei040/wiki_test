The outer lines are $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_4$. The inner lines are $\\nu_2$ and $\\nu_3$.\nThe outer separation is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\nu_1 - \\nu_4 = \\left(\\nu_{center} + C + \\frac{J}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\nu_{center} - C - \\frac{J}{2}\\right) = 2C + J\n$$\nThe inner separation is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\nu_2 - \\nu_3 = \\left(\\nu_{center} + C - \\frac{J}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\nu_{center} - C + \\frac{J}{2}\\right) = 2C - J\n$$\nThese two equations form a system that can be solved for $J$. Subtracting the second equation from the first yields the desired working relation, which is the basis for the Herzfeld-Berger analysis:\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{in}} = (2C + J) - (2C - J) = 2J\n$$\n$$\nJ = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{in}})\n$$\nThis relation allows for a direct calculation of $J$ from the four measured line positions.\n\nNow, we apply this derived relation to the provided data.\nSpectrometer frequency: $\\nu_0 = 500~\\mathrm{MHz} = 500 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe chemical shifts are given as:\n$\\delta_{1} = 3.7400~\\mathrm{ppm}$\n$\\delta_{2} = 3.7100~\\mathrm{ppm}$\n$\\delta_{3} = 3.6900~\\mathrm{ppm}$\n$\\delta_{4} = 3.6600~\\mathrm{ppm}$\n\nWe convert these chemical shifts to frequencies in Hertz using the relation $\\nu_i (\\mathrm{Hz}) = \\delta_i (\\mathrm{ppm}) \\times \\nu_0 (\\mathrm{MHz})$:\n$\\nu_1 = 3.7400 \\times 500 = 1870.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$\\nu_2 = 3.7100 \\times 500 = 1855.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$\\nu_3 = 3.6900 \\times 500 = 1845.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$\\nu_4 = 3.6600 \\times 500 = 1830.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nNext, we compute the outer and inner separations using these frequencies:\n$\\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\nu_1 - \\nu_4 = 1870.00~\\mathrm{Hz} - 1830.00~\\mathrm{Hz} = 40.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$\\Delta\\nu_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\nu_2 - \\nu_3 = 1855.00~\\mathrm{Hz} - 1845.00~\\mathrm{Hz} = 10.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nFinally, we substitute these separation values into our derived formula for $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{1}{2}(40.00~\\mathrm{Hz} - 10.00~\\mathrm{Hz}) = \\frac{1}{2}(30.00~\\mathrm{Hz}) = 15.00~\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The result $15.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$ has four significant figures.\nAs a check, we can also note from our line position expressions that $J = \\nu_1 - \\nu_2$ and $J = \\nu_3 - \\nu_4$.\nUsing the data:\n$J = \\nu_1 - \\nu_2 = 1870.00~\\mathrm{Hz} - 1855.00~\\mathrm{Hz} = 15.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$J = \\nu_3 - \\nu_4 = 1845.00~\\mathrm{Hz} - 1830.00~\\mathrm{Hz} = 15.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$\nThis perfect agreement confirms the correctness of our derivation and calculation. The scalar coupling constant $J$ is $15.00~\\mathrm{Hz}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15.00}$$", "id": "3726838"}]}
