Diagonalization yields two new eigenstates which are linear combinations (mixtures) of $|\\alpha\\beta\\rangle$ and $|\\beta\\alpha\\rangle$:\n$$ |\\psi_2\\rangle = \\cos\\theta |\\alpha\\beta\\rangle - \\sin\\theta |\\beta\\alpha\\rangle $$\n$$ |\\psi_3\\rangle = \\sin\\theta |\\alpha\\beta\\rangle + \\cos\\theta |\\beta\\alpha\\rangle $$\nThe mixing angle $\\theta$ is given by $\\tan(2\\theta) = J_{AB} / \\Delta\\nu_{AB} = 12/20 = 0.6$. This confirms that the eigenstates are indeed mixtures.\n\n**2. Virtual Coupling and the Spectrum of X**\n\nThe spin of nucleus $X$ interacts with spins $A$ and $B$ via the term $J_{AX}\\hat{\\mathbf{I}}_A \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{I}}_X + J_{BX}\\hat{\\mathbf{I}}_B \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{I}}_X$. Since $J_{AX}=0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, this simplifies to $J_{BX}\\hat{\\mathbf{I}}_B \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{I}}_X$. Under the high-field approximation, this is dominated by the secular term $J_{BX}\\hat{I}_{Bz}\\hat{I}_{Xz}$.\n\nThe transition frequencies for the $X$ spin depend on the spin state of the AB system. For each eigenstate $|\\psi_I\\rangle$ of the AB system, there is a corresponding X-transition at frequency $\\nu(X)_I$. In a first-order perturbation approach, this frequency is given by:\n$$ \\nu(X)_I = \\nu_X + J_{AX}\\langle\\psi_I|\\hat{I}_{Az}|\\psi_I\\rangle + J_{BX}\\langle\\psi_I|\\hat{I}_{Bz}|\\psi_I\\rangle $$\nWith $J_{AX}=0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$ \\nu(X)_I = \\nu_X + J_{BX}\\langle\\psi_I|\\hat{I}_{Bz}|\\psi_I\\rangle $$\nWe must find the expectation value of the spin B operator, $\\langle\\hat{I}_{Bz}\\rangle$, for each of the four AB eigenstates.\n-   For $|\\psi_1\\rangle = |\\alpha\\alpha\\rangle$: $\\langle\\hat{I}_{Bz}\\rangle = 1/2$. Transition at $\\nu_X + J_{BX}/2 = \\nu_X + 4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   For $|\\psi_4\\rangle = |\\beta\\beta\\rangle$: $\\langle\\hat{I}_{Bz}\\rangle = -1/2$. Transition at $\\nu_X - J_{BX}/2 = \\nu_X - 4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   For the mixed states, the expectation value is no longer simply $\\pm 1/2$.\n    -   For $|\\psi_3\\rangle$ (symmetric combination): $\\langle\\hat{I}_{Bz}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\theta)$.\n    -   For $|\\psi_2\\rangle$ (antisymmetric combination): $\\langle\\hat{I}_{Bz}\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\theta)$.\n    From $\\tan(2\\theta) = 0.6$, we find $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\tan^2(2\\theta)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.36}} \\approx 0.8575$.\n    The other two transitions are therefore at:\n    -   $\\nu_X + J_{BX}(\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\theta)) = \\nu_X + 4\\cos(2\\theta) \\approx \\nu_X + 4(0.8575) \\approx \\nu_X + 3.43\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   $\\nu_X + J_{BX}(-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\theta)) = \\nu_X - 4\\cos(2\\theta) \\approx \\nu_X - 4(0.8575) \\approx \\nu_X - 3.43\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe state mixing in the AB system, caused by strong coupling ($J_{AB}$), results in the A spin influencing the effective spin state of B as seen by X. This indirect influence, which creates splittings in the X resonance that depend on the AB parameters even though $J_{AX}=0$, is termed \"virtual coupling\".\n\nThis analysis predicts that the $X$ resonance is a pseudo-quartet of four lines of approximately equal intensity at positions $\\nu_X \\pm 4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $\\nu_X \\pm 3.43\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **Option A**: This option states the X resonance is a strict doublet with splitting $J_{BX}=8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This would only be true if the AB system were weakly coupled (i.e., $\\Delta\\nu_{AB} \\gg J_{AB}$), which is not the case here. This option incorrectly ignores the second-order strong coupling effects. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option B**: This option correctly identifies the mechanism: \"The AB strong coupling mixes $|\\alpha\\beta\\rangle$ and $|\\beta\\alpha\\rangle$ of A and B, so X couples to AB eigenstates with non-integer effective $z$-projections, creating 'virtual coupling'.\" This is an excellent qualitative description. It then describes the spectrum as an \"apparent three-line pattern with intensities approximately $1:2:1$\", with lines at $\\nu_X + 4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $\\nu_X - 4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, and $\\nu_X - 3.43\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The line positions provided are a subset of those derived in our approximate model ($\\nu_X \\pm 4$, $\\nu_X - 3.43$). The line at $\\nu_X + 3.43\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is missing, and the description of a $1:2:1$ triplet is inconsistent with the non-symmetric line positions and the prediction of four lines from the model. However, it is the only option that correctly describes the physical mechanism and includes numerically correct values derived from that mechanism. The description of the pattern is flawed, but the core physics and calculations are present. **Correct**.\n\n-   **Option C**: This option suggests an incorrect mechanism of an \"effective\" coupling and predicts a simple quartet with equal spacings. The actual pattern does not have equal spacings. The spacing between the outermost lines is $8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, while the spacing between the inner lines is $2 \\times 3.43 = 6.86\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option D**: This option claims that strong coupling averages the magnetizations leading to decoupling. This is incorrect. Strong coupling leads to complex mixed states, not simple averaging or decoupling. The X nucleus remains coupled to B. A singlet would only appear if both $J_{AX}$ and $J_{BX}$ were zero. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option E**: This option proposes an incorrect mechanism. The problem is set in an isotropic liquid, where through-space dipolar coupling is averaged to zero and does not produce sharp splittings. The interaction is explicitly stated to be isotropic scalar coupling. The line positions suggested ($\\nu_X$ and $\\nu_X \\pm 4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) also do not match the expected pattern. **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption B provides a physically correct explanation of the virtual coupling phenomenon. Although its description of the resulting spectral pattern is flawed and internally inconsistent, it is the only option that contains the correct physical principles and correctly calculated line positions based on those principles. It stands as the \"best\" available answer among the choices.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3724729"}]}
