For singly charged fragment ions, the observed mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ equals the monoisotopic mass of the ion divided by its charge $z$, and for $z=1$ the electron mass cancels in differences between isomeric or homologous ions. Consider two spectra collected under identical conditions for two isomeric substrates that differ only by replacing an $N$-methyl group ($\\text{CH}_3$) with an $N$-ethyl group ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5$), with the base peak in each spectrum assigned to the iminium cation that retains the N-alkyl substituent. Assume that the cation composition changes only by the replacement of the $\\text{CH}_3$ group with $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5$ in the fragment that becomes the base peak. Using the monoisotopic atomic masses $m(\\mathrm{^{12}C})=12.000000$, $m(\\mathrm{^1H})=1.007825$, and $m(\\mathrm{^{14}N})=14.003074$ (in daltons), compute the expected shift $\\Delta(m/z)$ in the base peak between the $\\text{CH}_3$-substituted and $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5$-substituted amide spectra.

Under Electron Ionization (EI) conditions, a well-tested observation for N-alkyl amides is that cleavage $\\alpha$ to the nitrogen yields an iminium-type cation that retains the N-alkyl moiety. Because the base peak is attributed to this cation in both spectra and the charge state is $z=1$, the shift in $m/z$ equals the difference in the monoisotopic masses of the two iminium ions.\n\nBy the problem’s setup, the only compositional change in the fragment that becomes the base peak is the replacement of the $\\text{CH}_3$ group by the $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5$ group on nitrogen.

Increased alkyl substitution enhances stabilization by both hyperconjugation (more $\\sigma \\rightarrow p$ donation into the cationic center) and inductive electron donation. Replacing $\\text{CH}_3$ with $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5$ adds additional C-H bonds capable of hyperconjugation and slightly increases polarizability. This stabilization lowers the appearance energy of the iminium cation and makes its formation more favorable relative to competing channels, often resulting in higher relative intensity (and thus a more prominent or even base-peak) for the ethyl-substituted iminium cation. Because the charge state is unchanged ($z=1$ in both cases), the electron mass cancels in the difference, and the observed shift is determined solely by the added $\\text{CH}_2$ unit mass.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.016}$$", "id": "3704092"}, {"introduction": "Isotopic labeling is an indispensable technique for unambiguously tracking atoms through complex fragmentation and ionization processes.
