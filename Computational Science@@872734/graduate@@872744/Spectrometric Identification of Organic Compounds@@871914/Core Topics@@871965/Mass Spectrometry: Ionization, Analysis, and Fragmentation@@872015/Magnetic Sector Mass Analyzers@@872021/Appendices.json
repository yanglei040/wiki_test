It is based on fundamental principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism as applied to mass spectrometry, contains all necessary information, and uses realistic physical parameters. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe analysis of an ion's trajectory in a magnetic sector mass analyzer is governed by two fundamental principles. First, an ion of mass $m$ and charge $q$, accelerated from rest through an electrostatic potential difference $V$, gains kinetic energy $K$. By the work-energy theorem, this kinetic energy is equal to the work done on the ion by the electric field:\n$$K = qV$$\nAssuming nonrelativistic motion, the kinetic energy is also given by:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\nwhere $v$ is the final velocity of the ion upon entering the magnetic field. Equating these two expressions for kinetic energy yields our first governing equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qV \\quad (1)$$\n\nSecond, when the ion enters the uniform magnetic field $B$ with its velocity vector perpendicular to the field lines, it experiences a Lorentz force, $F_B$. The magnitude of this force is given by:\n$$F_B = qvB$$\nThis force is always perpendicular to the ion's velocity, acting as a centripetal force that constrains the ion to a circular path. For the ion to be transmitted, the radius of this path must be equal to the fixed bending radius $\\rho$ of the analyzer. The required centripetal force, $F_c$, is:\n$$F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{\\rho}$$\nEquating the magnetic force to the centripetal force gives our second governing equation:\n$$qvB = \\frac{mv^2}{\\rho} \\quad (2)$$\n\nOur goal is to find an expression for the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/q$, that is independent of the ion's velocity $v$. We can rearrange equation $(2)$ to solve for $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{qB\\rho}{m}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $v$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{qB\\rho}{m}\\right)^2 = qV$$\nExpanding the squared term:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{q^2B^2\\rho^2}{m^2}\\right) = qV$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling terms:\n$$\\frac{q^2B^2\\rho^2}{2m} = qV$$\nWe can divide both sides by $q$ (since $q \\neq 0$ for an ion) and rearrange the equation to solve for the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/q$:\n$$\\frac{qB^2\\rho^2}{2m} = V$$\n$$\\frac{m}{q} = \\frac{B^2\\rho^2}{2V}$$\n\nThe problem states that the acceleration potential $V$ and the bending radius $\\rho$ are fixed. Therefore, the maximum mass-to-charge ratio, $(m/q)_{\\max}$, that can be transmitted through the analyzer corresponds to the maximum achievable magnetic field strength, $B_{\\max}$.

We will address each part of the problem systematically, based on the provided definitions and assumptions.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the transmitted ion current $I$ and the slit width parameter $s$. The incident ion current density at the entrance slit is given as a uniform value, $J_0$. The transmission of the slit at a transverse coordinate $x$ is described by a Gaussian function $T(x) \\propto \\exp(-x^{2}/(2 s^{2}))$. Let the proportionality constant be $k_T$, so $T(x) = k_T \\exp(-x^{2}/(2 s^{2}))$. The total transmitted ion current $I$ is the integral of the product of the incident current density and the transmission function over the entire slit plane.\n$$\nI = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_0 T(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_0$ and $T(x)$, we have:\n$$\nI = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_0 k_T \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2s^2}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nSince $J_0$ and $k_T$ are constants, we can take them out of the integral:\n$$\nI = J_0 k_T \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2s^2}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. In our case, the parameter $a = 1/(2s^2)$. Therefore, the integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2s^2}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1/(2s^2)}} = \\sqrt{2\\pi s^2} = s\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $I$, we get:\n$$\nI = J_0 k_T s\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\nSince $J_0$, $k_T$, and $\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ are constants independent of the slit width, the transmitted ion current $I$ is directly proportional to the slit width parameter $s$.\n$$\nI \\propto s\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the dependence of the mass resolving power $R$ on $s$. The resolving power is defined as $R = m_0/\\Delta m$, where $\\Delta m$ is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the mass peak. The problem states that the resolution is limited by the entrance slit. The spatial distribution of ions transmitted through the entrance slit is proportional to $T(x)$, which is a Gaussian function with standard deviation $s$. These ions are then imaged onto the focal plane. The ion optics introduce a geometric magnification $\\mathcal{M}$, which linearly scales the spatial distribution. A Gaussian distribution with standard deviation $s$ at the entrance plane will be transformed into a Gaussian distribution at the focal plane with a standard deviation $\\sigma_{x'}$ given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{x'} = |\\mathcal{M}| s\n$$\nThe spatial intensity profile of the ion beam at the focal plane for a fixed mass $m_0$ is therefore a Gaussian function with standard deviation $\\sigma_{x'}$. The FWHM of a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation $\\sigma$ is given by the relation $\\text{FWHM} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\sigma$. Thus, the spatial FWHM of the ion beam at the detector, $\\Delta x'_{\\text{FWHM}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta x'_{\\text{FWHM}} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\sigma_{x'} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} |\\mathcal{M}| s\n$$\nThis spatial width must be related to the mass width $\\Delta m$. The local mass dispersion, $\\mathcal{D} = \\mathrm{d}x'/\\mathrm{d}m$, provides this link. For a small mass interval, $\\Delta x' \\approx |\\mathcal{D}| \\Delta m$. Therefore, the mass FWHM $\\Delta m$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta m = \\frac{\\Delta x'_{\\text{FWHM}}}{|\\mathcal{D}|} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} |\\mathcal{M}| s}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\n$$\nNow we can express the resolving power $R$ as:\n$$\nR = \\frac{m_0}{\\Delta m} = \\frac{m_0}{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} |\\mathcal{M}| s}{|\\mathcal{D}|}} = \\frac{m_0 |\\mathcal{D}|}{2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} |\\mathcal{M}| s}\n$$\nThe quantities $m_0$, $\\mathcal{D}$, $\\mathcal{M}$, and $2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2}$ are all constant for a given experimental setup. Therefore, the resolving power $R$ is inversely proportional to the slit width parameter $s$.\n$$\nR \\propto \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the multiplicative change in both $I$ and $R$ when the entrance slit width parameter is halved, i.e., $s \\to s' = s/2$. Let the initial values be $I$ and $R$, and the new values be $I'$ and $R'$.\n\nFor the transmitted ion current:\n$$\n\\frac{I'}{I} = \\frac{k_I s'}{k_I s} = \\frac{s/2}{s} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nwhere $k_I$ is the proportionality constant for current. Halving the slit width parameter reduces the transmitted current by a factor of $2$.\n\nFor the resolving power:\n$$\n\\frac{R'}{R} = \\frac{k_R/s'}{k_R/s} = \\frac{s}{s'} = \\frac{s}{s/2} = 2\n$$\nwhere $k_R$ is the proportionality constant for resolution. Halving the slit width parameter doubles the resolving power.\n\nThe problem asks for these two multiplicative factors, $(I'/I)$ and $(R'/R)$, as a row matrix.
