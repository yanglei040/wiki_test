Under Electron Ionization (EI), a molecule is promoted to a radical cation ($\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$) that undergoes unimolecular dissociation on a microsecond timescale. Fragment abundances are governed by the competition between bond dissociation and rearrangement pathways, and by the thermodynamic stabilization of product ions. The tropylium cation ($\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$) is a $7$-membered cyclic cation that is planar, fully conjugated, and satisfies Hückel’s $4n+2$ $\\pi$-electron rule with $n=1$, giving $6$ $\\pi$ electrons and substantial aromatic stabilization. In EI mass spectrometry, odd-electron ions such as $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$ often form even-electron cations by loss of radicals (for example, $\\mathrm{H^{\\bullet}}$), and rearrangements that increase ion stability are favored when barriers are surmountable at the internal energies imparted by EI (for example, approximately $70$ electronvolts).\n\nAssume a sector instrument capable of detecting metastable ions and high-resolution exact masses.

Cycloheptatriene $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$ at $m/z$ $92$ can lose $\\mathrm{H^{\\bullet}}$ to form $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ that rapidly adopts the tropylium structure owing to aromatic stabilization; thus, a strong $m/z$ $91$ peak is expected.

Proceeding to solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe molecular formula for both toluene and cycloheptatriene is $\\mathrm{C_7H_8}$, corresponding to a nominal molecular mass of $92 \\ \\mathrm{u}$. The molecular ion, $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$, will therefore appear at $m/z \\ 92$.\n\n**Fundamental Principles of Fragmentation:**\n1.  **Toluene ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_3}$):** Upon EI, toluene forms the molecular ion $\\mathrm{C_7H_8^{+\\bullet}}$ at $m/z \\ 92$. The most favorable initial fragmentation is the loss of a hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H^{\\bullet}}$) to form a $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ cation at $m/z \\ 91$. While this is initially formed as the benzyl cation ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2^+}$), it readily undergoes rearrangement to the more thermodynamically stable aromatic tropylium cation. This rearrangement is so favorable that the $m/z \\ 91$ peak is typically the base peak (most intense peak) in the $70 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ EI spectrum of toluene.\n2.  **Cycloheptatriene ($\\mathrm{C_7H_8}$):** This isomer already possesses a seven-membered carbon ring. Upon ionization to $\\mathrm{C_7H_8^{+\\bullet}}$ ($m/z \\ 92$), the loss of a hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H^{\\bullet}}$) directly yields the aromatic tropylium cation ($\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$) at $m/z \\ 91$. This process is extremely facile due to the large thermodynamic driving force of forming an aromatic species. Therefore, cycloheptatriene also exhibits a very strong base peak at $m/z \\ 91$.\n3.  **Isomer Differentiation:** Because both isomers predominantly fragment to form the stable tropylium ion, their mass spectra are very similar at $70 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Differentiation relies on identifying minor fragmentation pathways that are unique to the original structure and occur competitively with, or prior to, complete isomerization to a common intermediate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Cycloheptatriene $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$ at $m/z$ $92$ can lose $\\mathrm{H^{\\bullet}}$ to form $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ that rapidly adopts the tropylium structure owing to aromatic stabilization; thus, a strong $m/z$ $91$ peak is expected. A diagnostic difference versus toluene is that cycloheptatriene shows significant $m/z$ $90$ (loss of $\\mathrm{H_2}$ from $m/z$ $92$) and a very weak or negligible $m/z$ $78$, whereas toluene exhibits a prominent $m/z$ $78$ ($\\mathrm{C_6H_6^{+\\bullet}}$) from loss of $\\mathrm{CH_3^{\\bullet}}$.**\n\n-   The description of cycloheptatriene fragmentation is highly accurate. It correctly states that it forms a strong $m/z \\ 91$ peak. Critically, it identifies a known diagnostic feature: cycloheptatriene's molecular ion can lose a molecule of hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H_2}$) to yield a significant peak at $m/z \\ 90$. This pathway is much less significant for toluene. The statement that cycloheptatriene shows a negligible $m/z \\ 78$ peak is also correct, as forming a benzene radical cation requires extensive rearrangement.\n-   The description of toluene fragmentation contains inaccuracies. The fragment at $m/z \\ 78$ ($\\mathrm{C_6H_6^{+\\bullet}}$) is not \"prominent\" in the spectrum of toluene; it is a minor peak, with a relative abundance typically around $5\\%$. Furthermore, its formation from the molecular ion at $m/z \\ 92$ would require the loss of a neutral $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ fragment (mass $14 \\ \\mathrm{u}$), not a methyl radical $\\mathrm{CH_3^{\\bullet}}$ (mass $15 \\ \\mathrm{u}$), which would lead to $m/z \\ 77$.\n-   Despite the flawed description of toluene's fragmentation, this option is the only one that correctly identifies a valid and key diagnostic difference: the significant $m/z \\ 90$ peak for cycloheptatriene. Among the choices, it presents the most accurate chemical insight.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**. This option is the \"most accurate\" because it correctly identifies the primary fragmentation of cycloheptatriene and a valid experimental method for differentiating the two isomers, even with some inaccuracy in its description of a minor toluene fragment.\n\n**B. Cycloheptatriene cannot form tropylium under EI because tropylium requires a benzylic precursor; only toluene shows $m/z$ $91$, while cycloheptatriene instead gives a dominant $m/z$ $90$ and essentially no $m/z$ $91$.**\n\n-   This statement is fundamentally incorrect. Cycloheptatriene is, in fact, an excellent precursor for the tropylium cation, arguably more direct than toluene. The claim that it gives \"essentially no $m/z \\ 91$\" is false; $m/z \\ 91$ is the base peak for cycloheptatriene. The idea that tropylium requires a benzylic precursor is also overly restrictive and false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The EI spectra of toluene and cycloheptatriene are indistinguishable at $70$ electronvolts because both produce only $m/z$ $91$ and $m/z$ $92$ above $m/z$ $50$; no additional informative fragments are expected.**\n\n-   This statement is incorrect on two counts. First, while the spectra are very similar, they are not completely indistinguishable; subtle differences in minor peaks (like $m/z \\ 90$) exist. Second, both spectra show other significant fragments above $m/z \\ 50$, most notably the prominent peak at $m/z \\ 65$ from the loss of acetylene ($\\mathrm{C_2H_2}$) from the tropylium ion ($91 \\rightarrow 65$).\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In high-resolution EI with metastable detection, toluene is distinguished by a metastable transition near $m/z$ $90$ for $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$ at $m/z$ $92 \\rightarrow m/z$ $91$, whereas cycloheptatriene is differentiated by a dominant metastable peak near $m/z$ $84$ corresponding to $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$ at $m/z$ $92 \\rightarrow m/z$ $66$ (loss of $\\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), and cycloheptatriene cannot produce $m/z$ $78$ at all.**\n\n-   This option contains a critical mathematical error. The apparent mass, $m^*$, of a metastable peak for a transition $m_1 \\rightarrow m_2$ is given by $m^* = (m_2)^2 / m_1$.\n-   For the proposed cycloheptatriene transition $m/z \\ 92 \\rightarrow m/z \\ 66$, the metastable peak would appear at $m^* = (66)^2 / 92 = 4356 / 92 \\approx 47.35$. This is nowhere near the stated position of $m/z \\ 84$. This gross inconsistency invalidates the claim.\n-   While metastable peaks can be used for differentiation, the evidence presented in this option is based on a false premise.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Both isomers generate $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ at $m/z$ $91$, but if the methyl group of toluene is fully deuterated, the base peak necessarily shifts to $m/z$ $92$, providing a definitive proof of a toluene origin for the tropylium ion in any EI experiment without exception.**\n\n-   This option describes a labeling experiment incorrectly. Toluene with a fully deuterated methyl group is $\\mathrm{C_6H_5CD_3}$. Its molecular mass is $95 \\ \\mathrm{u}$, so $\\mathrm{M^{+\\bullet}}$ is at $m/z \\ 95$. Fragmentation can occur by loss of a ring hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H^{\\bullet}}$) to give $m/z \\ 94$ or by loss of a methyl deuterium ($\\mathrm{D^{\\bullet}}$) to give $m/z \\ 93$. Due to scrambling and kinetic isotope effects, a complex pattern emerges around $m/z \\ 93-94$. The claim that the base peak \"necessarily shifts to $m/z \\ 92$\" is factually wrong; $m/z \\ 92$ would correspond to the loss of three mass units (e.g., $\\mathrm{HD + H}$), which is not the primary fragmentation process.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3704593"}, {"introduction": "The prevalence of the tropylium ion in mass spectra is a direct result of its exceptional thermodynamic stability.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\nThe resolving power, $R$, required to separate two mass spectral peaks is defined as the ratio of the mass of the ion, $m$, to the mass difference, $\\Delta m$, between the two peaks:\n$$R = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m}$$\nThe problem specifies that for this calculation, $m$ should be the monoisotopic mass of the tropylium ion, $[\\mathrm{C_7H_7}]^+$. The mass difference $\\Delta m$ is the absolute difference between the exact masses of the two ions in question.\n\nFirst, we calculate the exact mass of the monoisotopic tropylium ion, which we denote as $m_1$. Being monoisotopic, it is composed of the most abundant, lowest-mass stable isotopes: seven $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms and seven $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ atoms. The problem states to neglect the mass of the electron.\n$$m_1 = m([^{12}\\mathrm{C_7}{^1}\\mathrm{H_7}]^+)$$\n$$m_1 = 7 \\times m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 7 \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$$\nUsing the provided exact masses:\n$$m_1 = 7 \\times (12.00000000000) + 7 \\times (1.00782503223)$$\n$$m_1 = 84.00000000000 + 7.05477522561$$\n$$m_1 = 91.05477522561 \\text{ u}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the exact mass of the specified contaminant isotopologue, which we denote as $m_2$. The base formula is $[\\mathrm{C_5H_9O}]^+$. The problem states the isotopologue contains four $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms and one $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ atom. Since the total number of carbon atoms is five, the remaining one must be a $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom. The nine hydrogen atoms are assumed to be the monoisotopic $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, as no enrichment is specified for them.\nThe composition of this ion is therefore one $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom, four $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms, nine $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ atoms, and one $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ atom.\n$$m_2 = m([({^{12}\\mathrm{C})_1}({^{13}\\mathrm{C})_4}({^1}\\mathrm{H})_9({^{18}\\mathrm{O})_1}]^+)$$\n$$m_2 = 1 \\times m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 4 \\times m(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) + 9 \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + 1 \\times m(^{18}\\mathrm{O})$$\nUsing the provided exact masses:\n$$m_2 = 1 \\times (12.00000000000) + 4 \\times (13.00335483507) + 9 \\times (1.00782503223) + 1 \\times (17.99915961286)$$\n$$m_2 = 12.00000000000 + 52.01341934028 + 9.07042529007 + 17.99915961286$$\n$$m_2 = 91.08300424321 \\text{ u}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the mass difference, $\\Delta m$, between the two ions.\n$$\\Delta m = |m_2 - m_1|$$\n$$\\Delta m = |91.08300424321 - 91.05477522561|$$\n$$\\Delta m = 0.0282290176 \\text{ u}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required resolving power, $R$, using the mass of the tropylium ion, $m_1$, in the numerator as instructed.\n$$R = \\frac{m_1}{\\Delta m}$$\n$$R = \\frac{91.05477522561}{0.0282290176}$$\n$$R \\approx 3225.68835$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 3226$$\nThe resolving power is a dimensionless quantity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3226}$$", "id": "3704509"}]}
