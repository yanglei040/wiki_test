## Introduction
The mass spectrum of a saturated hydrocarbon, devoid of the reactive functional groups that guide fragmentation in other molecules, presents a unique interpretive challenge. How can we decipher the structure of an alkane or cycloalkane from a pattern of peaks generated by seemingly random C-C and C-H bond cleavages? The answer lies not in simple, charge-directed reactions, but in the subtle interplay of [thermochemistry](@entry_id:137688) and [unimolecular reaction kinetics](@entry_id:186559). This article addresses the knowledge gap between observing a complex alkane mass spectrum and understanding the fundamental physical organic principles that create it.

We begin our exploration by examining the core principles that transform a simple hydrocarbon molecule into a rich and informative, albeit complex, mass spectrum.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The fragmentation of [alkanes](@entry_id:185193) and [cycloalkanes](@entry_id:180990) under Electron Ionization (EI) conditions is a complex process governed by the principles of [unimolecular reaction kinetics](@entry_id:186559) and the thermochemical stability of ions and radicals. Unlike molecules containing heteroatoms or $\pi$-systems, saturated hydrocarbons lack obvious, low-energy sites for ionization or charge-directed cleavage. Consequently, their fragmentation behavior is dictated by more subtle energetic factors, including bond strengths, product stabilities, and intramolecular rearrangements. This chapter will systematically dissect these principles, building from the initial ionization event to the complex pathways that generate an observed mass spectrum.

### The Energetics of Ion Formation: The Franck-Condon Principle

The first step in any EI mass spectrometric analysis is the creation of a gas-phase [radical cation](@entry_id:754018), $M^{+\bullet}$, from a neutral molecule, $M$. This occurs via the collision of a neutral molecule with a high-energy electron (typically $70 \ \mathrm{eV}$), which ejects one of the molecule's electrons. This ionization event is not a slow, [adiabatic process](@entry_id:138150) that produces the ion in its ground state. Instead, it is governed by the **Franck-Condon principle**, which states that electronic transitions are virtually instantaneous relative to the timescale of [nuclear motion](@entry_id:185492). The ionization event is therefore a **vertical transition**, occurring at the fixed nuclear geometry of the neutral precursor.

The energy of this vertical transition, the **[vertical ionization energy](@entry_id:171391)** ($IE_v$), is the energy difference between the neutral molecule and the [radical cation](@entry_id:754018) at the neutral's equilibrium geometry. In contrast, the **adiabatic ionization energy** ($IE_a$) is the energy difference between the ground vibrational state of the neutral and the ground vibrational state of the [radical cation](@entry_id:754018). If the equilibrium geometry of the cation is significantly different from that of the neutral, then $IE_v > IE_a$. In such cases, the vertical transition populates a manifold of vibrationally [excited states](@entry_id:273472) in the nascent [radical cation](@entry_id:754018). The larger the geometric change upon ionization, the broader the distribution of populated vibrational states and the higher the average internal energy deposited into the ion.

This principle explains a key difference in the fragmentation of linear [alkanes](@entry_id:185193) versus [cycloalkanes](@entry_id:180990) [@problem_id:3703529]. Consider the comparison between $n$-hexane and cyclohexane. A flexible, linear alkane like $n$-hexane experiences relatively minor changes in its bond lengths and angles upon ionization. Its [radical cation](@entry_id:754018) can relax to its new equilibrium geometry without significant structural distortion. In contrast, a conformationally constrained molecule like cyclohexane undergoes a substantial geometric change. The removal of a $\sigma$-electron destabilizes the rigid chair structure, causing the [radical cation](@entry_id:754018) to relax into a distorted, flattened geometry. This large geometric displacement means that the [ionization](@entry_id:136315) of cyclohexane populates significantly higher vibrational levels of the cation compared to $n$-hexane.

Therefore, even under identical EI conditions, the population of nascent cyclohexane radical cations possesses a higher average internal energy and a broader energy distribution than the population of $n$-hexane radical cations. This "hotter" population of ions is more prone to fragmentation, which is experimentally observed as a much less intense [molecular ion peak](@entry_id:192587) for cyclohexane relative to that of $n$-hexane.

### The Governing Rules of Fragmentation: Energetics and Kinetics

Once formed, the internally excited radical cation, $M^{+\bullet}$, does not fragment randomly. Its dissociation is a series of competing [unimolecular reactions](@entry_id:167301), and the observed spectrum is the cumulative result of the pathways with the fastest rates. According to statistical rate theories like **Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory**, the rate of a given fragmentation channel is steeply dependent on two factors: the internal energy of the ion ($E_{\text{int}}$) and the [critical energy](@entry_id:158905) ($E_0$) for that channel. At a given internal energy, pathways with a lower [critical energy](@entry_id:158905) will proceed much faster and will therefore dominate the [fragmentation pattern](@entry_id:198600).

The [critical energy](@entry_id:158905) for a simple bond cleavage is primarily determined by the **[bond dissociation energy](@entry_id:136571) (BDE)** of the bond being broken, modulated by the stability of the fragments being formed [@problem_id:3703567]. The primary fragmentation pathway for an alkane radical cation is the homolytic cleavage of a single carbon-carbon bond to produce an even-electron [carbocation](@entry_id:199575) and a neutral, odd-electron radical:

$$ [R_1-R_2]^{+\bullet} \longrightarrow R_1^+ + R_2^{\bullet} $$

The stability of the resulting products is a crucial factor in lowering the [critical energy](@entry_id:158905). Two main factors contribute:

1.  **C-C Bond Strength**: Weaker bonds are cleaved more readily. The BDE of a C-C bond is highly dependent on substitution. Bonds that break to form more stable, highly substituted radicals are inherently weaker. For instance, a typical BDE for a primary-primary C-C bond (as in ethane) is in the range of $360-390 \ \mathrm{kJ \ mol^{-1}}$, whereas the BDE for a tertiary-secondary linkage is significantly lower, typically $300-340 \ \mathrm{kJ \ mol^{-1}}$ [@problem_id:3703567].

2.  **Carbocation Stability**: The single most important factor guiding [alkane fragmentation](@entry_id:746366) is the stability of the resulting carbocation. The established stability order is **tertiary > secondary > primary**. This stability trend has a firm physical basis in the principle of **hyperconjugation** [@problem_id:3552]. A carbocationic center possesses a vacant $p$-orbital. Electron density from adjacent, properly aligned C-H or C-C $\sigma$-bonds can delocalize into this empty orbital, spreading out the positive charge and lowering the system's energy. A tertiary [carbocation](@entry_id:199575), such as the *tert*-butyl cation, has nine adjacent C-H bonds that can act as electron donors, providing substantial stabilization. A primary carbocation has far fewer potential donors and is thus significantly less stable.

The interplay of these factors means that fragmentation will overwhelmingly favor pathways that cleave the weakest C-C bonds to produce the most highly substituted (and thus most stable) carbocation possible. This is often summarized by **Stevenson's Rule**, which states that upon fragmentation, the positive charge will be retained by the fragment with the lower ionization energy. For alkyl fragments, this corresponds to the one that forms the more stable carbocation.

### Primary Fragmentation Pathways and the Effect of Branching

The fragmentation of a linear alkane provides a clear illustration of these rules. For the $n$-hexane [radical cation](@entry_id:754018) ($\mathrm{C_6H_{14}^{\bullet+}}$), there are three unique C-C bonds that can cleave. Each cleavage can, in principle, produce two different [carbocations](@entry_id:185610), depending on which fragment retains the charge. Application of conservation of mass and charge allows for the enumeration of all possible primary fragment ions [@problem_id:3703574]:
*   Cleavage of C1-C2: Loss of $\mathrm{C_5H_{11}^{\bullet}}$ to form $\mathrm{CH_3^+}$ ($m/z \ 15$) or loss of $\mathrm{CH_3^{\bullet}}$ to form $\mathrm{C_5H_{11}^+}$ ($m/z \ 71$).
*   Cleavage of C2-C3: Loss of $\mathrm{C_4H_9^{\bullet}}$ to form $\mathrm{C_2H_5^+}$ ($m/z \ 29$) or loss of $\mathrm{C_2H_5^{\bullet}}$ to form $\mathrm{C_4H_9^+}$ ($m/z \ 57$).
*   Cleavage of C3-C4: Loss of $\mathrm{C_3H_7^{\bullet}}$ to form $\mathrm{C_3H_7^+}$ ($m/z \ 43$).

While all these ions may be present, their relative intensities are not equal. The ions at $m/z \ 43$ and $m/z \ 57$ are typically the most prominent in the spectra of linear [alkanes](@entry_id:185193) because they represent more stable secondary [carbocation](@entry_id:199575) structures that can be formed after rearrangement (a topic discussed later).

The effect of branching is dramatic and directly follows from the principle of [carbocation stability](@entry_id:149581) [@problem_id:3703558]. A [branch point](@entry_id:169747) in an alkane chain introduces a tertiary or [quaternary carbon](@entry_id:199819), which serves as a focal point for low-energy fragmentation. Cleavage at a branch point readily produces a stable secondary or tertiary [carbocation](@entry_id:199575). This is so favorable that branched [alkanes](@entry_id:185193) typically exhibit very weak or entirely absent molecular ion peaks, as the initial [radical cation](@entry_id:754018) fragments almost immediately.

*   **Isobutane (2-methylpropane)** possesses a tertiary carbon. Cleavage of a C-C bond at this center results in the loss of a methyl radical ($\mathrm{CH_3^{\bullet}}$) to form the highly stable secondary isopropyl cation, $\mathrm{C_3H_7^+}$, which appears as the [base peak](@entry_id:746686) at $m/z \ 43$.

*   **2,2-Dimethylpropane (neopentane)** has a [quaternary carbon](@entry_id:199819) center. Cleavage of any of its four equivalent C-C bonds leads to the loss of a methyl radical and the formation of the exceptionally stable *tert*-butyl cation, $\mathrm{C_4H_9^+}$. This ion produces an extremely intense [base peak](@entry_id:746686) at $m/z \ 57$, and the [molecular ion](@entry_id:202152) at $m/z \ 72$ is almost never observed.

*   **Isopentane (2-methylbutane)** provides a path to both secondary [carbocations](@entry_id:185610). Loss of an ethyl radical leads to the isopropyl cation ($m/z \ 43$), while loss of a methyl radical yields a secondary butyl cation ($m/z \ 57$). In practice, the loss of the larger ethyl group is kinetically favored, and $m/z \ 43$ is the [base peak](@entry_id:746686).

These examples show how the presence of branching directs fragmentation towards the formation of specific, highly stable [carbocations](@entry_id:185610), resulting in characteristic and often diagnostic base peaks.

### Fragmentation Mechanisms of Cycloalkanes

Cycloalkanes introduce a unique fragmentation mechanism not available to their acyclic counterparts: **ring opening**. The initial step in the fragmentation of a cycloalkane radical cation is typically not the loss of a fragment, but an isomerization of the cyclic ion into a linear, open-chain radical cation of the same mass [@problem_id:3703532]. This process occurs via the homolytic cleavage of one of the ring's C-C bonds. The resulting species is an acyclic [radical cation](@entry_id:754018), which is often a **[distonic ion](@entry_id:748583)**—a stable structure in which the radical and charge sites are separated at opposite ends of the carbon chain (e.g., $^+\mathrm{CH}_2(\mathrm{CH}_2)_n\mathrm{CH}_2^{\bullet}$).

The primary driving force for ring opening in small rings is the substantial **relief of [ring strain](@entry_id:201345)** [@problem_id:3703569]. Cyclopropane and cyclobutane possess enormous strain energies ($\approx 115 \ \mathrm{kJ \ mol^{-1}}$ and $\approx 110 \ \mathrm{kJ \ mol^{-1}}$, respectively). The [critical energy](@entry_id:158905) for a ring-opening fragmentation is lowered by this full amount. This, combined with the ability of the open-chain ion to rearrange and form a highly stabilized product like a resonance-stabilized allylic cation ($\mathrm{C_3H_5^+}$ at $m/z \ 41$, for instance), makes ring opening an overwhelmingly favorable pathway. Once the ring is opened, the resulting linear [radical cation](@entry_id:754018) fragments via pathways common to [alkanes](@entry_id:185193), often characterized by sequential losses of small, stable neutral molecules like [ethene](@entry_id:275772) ($\mathrm{C_2H_4}$).

### The Complication of Rearrangements and Information Scrambling

While the principles outlined above provide a rational framework for predicting fragmentation, the high internal energy deposited during EI complicates the picture significantly. The initially formed [radical cation](@entry_id:754018) is not static; it is a fluxional species that can undergo rapid intramolecular rearrangements prior to, or in competition with, bond cleavage. The most common rearrangements are **1,2-hydride shifts** and **1,2-methyl shifts**.

These rearrangements are driven by the same force that directs fragmentation: the drive to form a more stable carbocation. For example, if ionization initially creates a [radical cation](@entry_id:754018) with the charge on a secondary carbon, a 1,[2-hydride shift](@entry_id:198648) from an adjacent tertiary carbon can readily occur to relocate the positive charge to the more stable tertiary position [@problem_id:3703497]. Fragmentation then proceeds from this more stable, rearranged intermediate.

The critical insight for spectral interpretation is that the energy barriers for these rearrangements are low and comparable to the barriers for C-C bond cleavage. Given that the internal energy of the ion after $70 \ \mathrm{eV}$ [ionization](@entry_id:136315) (e.g., $E^* \approx 8 \ \mathrm{eV}$) is substantially higher than the barriers for both rearrangement (e.g., $\approx 1.6-1.8 \ \mathrm{eV}$) and cleavage (e.g., $\approx 1.4 \ \mathrm{eV}$), the ion has ample energy and time (microseconds in the source) to undergo multiple rearrangement steps before it dissociates [@problem_id:3703551].

This leads to the phenomenon of **[information scrambling](@entry_id:137768)**. The structure of the ion that ultimately fragments may bear little resemblance to the structure of the original neutral molecule. Different [structural isomers](@entry_id:146226) can, through different rearrangement pathways, converge upon a common set of low-energy intermediate structures. These common intermediates then fragment to produce a similar set of abundant product ions. For example, many of the 18 different [structural isomers](@entry_id:146226) of octane ($\mathrm{C_8H_{18}}$) produce mass spectra that are remarkably similar, all dominated by fragment ions at $m/z \ 43$, $57$, and $41$. This scrambling of [positional information](@entry_id:155141) makes the unambiguous identification of a specific alkane isomer from its EI mass spectrum alone a formidable, and often impossible, challenge. Distinguishing such isomers requires more advanced techniques, such as [tandem mass spectrometry](@entry_id:148596) (MS/MS) or isotopic labeling, which can restore the kinetic connectivity between a specific precursor and its fragments.
