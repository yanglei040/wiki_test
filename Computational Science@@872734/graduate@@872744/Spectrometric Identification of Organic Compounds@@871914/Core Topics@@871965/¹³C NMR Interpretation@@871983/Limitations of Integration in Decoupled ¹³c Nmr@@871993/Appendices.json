The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or vagueness. It is a standard, solvable problem in spectrometric analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe signal intensity, $I$, in a pulsed Fourier Transform NMR experiment is proportional to the amount of longitudinal magnetization, $M_z$, that is available to be tipped into the transverse plane by the radiofrequency pulse. Under steady-state conditions with a recycle delay $d$ between pulses, the intensity is governed by two main factors: spin-lattice relaxation ($T_1$) and the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE).\n\nThe signal intensity $I$ for a given carbon nucleus can be expressed as:\n$$ I \\propto M_0' \\left(1 - e^{-d/T_1}\\right) $$\nwhere $d$ is the recycle delay, $T_1$ is the spin-lattice relaxation time, and $M_0'$ is the effective equilibrium magnetization, which includes any enhancement from the NOE.\n\nThe NOE enhances the signal of a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ nucleus when its attached $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ nuclei are decoupled. The effective magnetization $M_0'$ is related to the intrinsic Boltzmann equilibrium magnetization $M_0$ by the enhancement factor $\\eta$:\n$$ M_0' = (1 + \\eta) M_0 $$\nThe maximum theoretical enhancement for a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ nucleus relaxed exclusively by dipole-dipole interactions with protons is $\\eta_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{H}}{2\\gamma_{C}} \\approx 1.988$. This gives a maximum signal increase by a factor of $(1+\\eta_{\\text{max}}) \\approx 3$.\n\nWe must analyze the two types of carbons under the specified experimental conditions.\n\n**1. Quaternary Carbon ($\\mathrm{C}_{\\text{quat}}$):**\n-   **NOE:** A quaternary carbon has no directly attached protons. Its relaxation is dominated by mechanisms other than the dipole-dipole interaction with protons (e.g., dipole-dipole with more distant protons, chemical shift anisotropy). Consequently, the NOE is very small or negligible. We can approximate $\\eta_{\\text{quat}} \\approx 0$, so the intensity factor is $(1 + \\eta_{\\text{quat}}) \\approx 1$.\n-   **$T_1$ Relaxation:** Due to the inefficiency of its relaxation pathways, a quaternary carbon has a very long spin-lattice relaxation time, typically in the range of $20-100$ seconds. This will be the longest $T_1$ in the molecule, so $T_{1,\\text{quat}} = T_{1,\\text{longest}}$.\n-   **Signal Attenuation:** The problem states the recycle delay $d$ is short, with $d  T_{1,\\text{longest}}$. This means $d \\ll T_{1,\\text{quat}}$. The term $(1 - e^{-d/T_{1,\\text{quat}}})$ represents the fraction of magnetization recovered during the delay. Since the exponent is small, we can use the approximation $e^{-x} \\approx 1 - x$, yielding $(1 - (1 - d/T_{1,\\text{quat}})) = d/T_{1,\\text{quat}}$. This is a small fractional value, indicating severe signal attenuation (saturation).\n-   **Intensity ($I_{\\text{quat}}$):**\n    $$ I_{\\text{quat}} \\propto (1 + \\eta_{\\text{quat}}) (1 - e^{-d/T_{1,\\text{quat}}}) \\approx (1) \\left(\\frac{d}{T_{1,\\text{quat}}}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Methine Carbons ($\\mathrm{CH}_{\\text{meth}}$):**\n-   **NOE:** A methine carbon has one directly attached proton. The dipole-dipole mechanism is the dominant relaxation pathway. Therefore, these carbons experience a large NOE, with $\\eta_{\\text{meth}}$ approaching the maximum value of $\\approx 2$. The intensity factor is $(1 + \\eta_{\\text{meth}}) \\approx 3$.\n-   **$T_1$ Relaxation:** The efficient dipole-dipole relaxation pathway results in a short spin-lattice relaxation time, typically $1-5$ seconds. Thus, $T_{1,\\text{meth}} \\ll T_{1,\\text{quat}}$.\n-   **Signal Attenuation:** A typical \"short\" recycle delay in routine $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR is $1-2$ seconds. This value is often on the same order of magnitude as the $T_1$ for protonated carbons, i.e., $d \\approx T_{1,\\text{meth}}$. The relaxation term $(1 - e^{-d/T_{1,\\text{meth}}})$ is therefore significant. For instance, if $d = T_{1,\\text{meth}}$, this factor is $(1 - e^{-1}) \\approx 0.63$. This is much larger than the factor for the quaternary carbon.\n-   **Intensity ($I_{\\text{meth}}$):**\n    $$ I_{\\text{meth}} \\propto (1 + \\eta_{\\text{meth}}) (1 - e^{-d/T_{1,\\text{meth}}}) \\approx 3 \\left(1 - e^{-d/T_{1,\\text{meth}}}\\right) $$\n\n**Relative Intensities:**\nLet's calculate the ratio of the intensity of a single methine signal to the quaternary signal, $\\frac{I_{\\text{meth}}}{I_{\\text{quat}}}$:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{meth}}}{I_{\\text{quat}}} \\approx \\frac{3 \\left(1 - e^{-d/T_{1,\\text{meth}}}\\right)}{1 \\left(1 - e^{-d/T_{1,\\text{quat}}}\\right)} $$\nLet's use physically plausible values. Let $T_{1,\\text{meth}} = 2$ s, and a $T_1$ ratio of $T_{1,\\text{quat}}/T_{1,\\text{meth}} = 8$, so $T_{1,\\text{quat}} = 16$ s. Let the recycle delay be $d = 2$ s.\n-   Methine relaxation factor: $(1 - e^{-2/2}) = (1 - e^{-1}) \\approx 0.632$.\n-   Quaternary relaxation factor: $(1 - e^{-2/16}) = (1 - e^{-0.125}) \\approx 0.118$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{meth}}}{I_{\\text{quat}}} \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 0.632}{1 \\times 0.118} \\approx \\frac{1.896}{0.118} \\approx 16.1 $$\nLet's consider a smaller NOE, say $\\eta_{\\text{meth}} = 1.5$ (factor of $2.5$), and a smaller $T_1$ ratio, say $T_{1,\\text{quat}}/T_{1,\\text{meth}} = 6$. Let $T_{1,\\text{meth}} = 3$ s, $T_{1,\\text{quat}} = 18$ s, and $d = 3$ s.\n-   Methine relaxation factor: $(1 - e^{-3/3}) = (1 - e^{-1}) \\approx 0.632$.\n-   Quaternary relaxation factor: $(1 - e^{-3/18}) = (1 - e^{-1/6}) \\approx 0.154$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{meth}}}{I_{\\text{quat}}} \\approx \\frac{2.5 \\times 0.632}{1 \\times 0.154} \\approx \\frac{1.58}{0.154} \\approx 10.3 $$\nThese reasonable physical estimates show that the intensity of a single methine carbon is about an order of magnitude ($ \\approx 10\\times$ to $16\\times$) larger than the intensity of the quaternary carbon. The range of $\\sim 8\\text{–}12\\times$ is eminently plausible.\n\nThe problem states there are $3$ such methine carbons, which are assumed to have comparable properties. Therefore, their signals will have comparable intensities. The total integrated intensity from all methine signals will be approximately $3$ times that of a single methine signal.\nTotal Methine Intensity $\\approx 3 \\times I_{\\text{meth}}$.\nThe ratio of total methine intensity to quaternary intensity is:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\text{total methine}}}{I_{\\text{quat}}} \\approx 3 \\times (8 \\text{ to } 12) = 24 \\text{ to } 36 $$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Each methine CH signal is roughly an order of magnitude more intense than the quaternary C signal (about ~$8$–$12\\times$ per methine), and the three methine signals are comparable to each other; consequently, the total integrated intensity from the three methine signals is about ~$25$–$35\\times$ that of the quaternary carbon.**\nThis aligns perfectly with our first-principles analysis. The factor of $\\sim 8\\text{–}12\\times$ per methine is a realistic consequence of the combined effects of strong NOE and more complete relaxation for the methine, versus no NOE and severe saturation for the quaternary carbon. The total integrated intensity for the three methines being in the range of $\\sim 25\\text{–}35\\times$ is a direct and correct calculation from the single-carbon ratio ($3 \\times (8 \\text{ to } 12) = 24 \\text{ to } 36$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Each methine CH signal is only about $2\\times$ the quaternary C signal, giving a total methine intensity of about $\\sim 6\\times$ the quaternary.**\nThis option drastically underestimates the effect. A factor of $\\sim 2\\text{–}3$ might arise from the NOE alone if there were no differential saturation effects (i.e., if $d$ were very long). However, the problem explicitly states $d$ is short, which introduces a large additional multiplicative factor from the differential relaxation, making the intensity difference much greater than $2\\times$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. All four carbons integrate approximately equally (within $\\pm 20\\%$), because full decoupling removes differential effects.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. Routine $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$-decoupled spectra are notoriously non-quantitative for the very reasons outlined above (differential NOE and $T_1$ effects). Achieving quantitative integrals (equal intensity per carbon) requires special pulse sequences that suppress NOE and use a very long recycle delay ($d \\gg T_{1,\\text{longest}}$) to eliminate saturation. The conditions described are the opposite of those required for equal integration.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The quaternary C signal is the most intense due to its typically longer $T_1$, so it integrates higher than each methine CH signal.**\nThis statement reverses the consequence of a long $T_1$ time. In a pulsed experiment with a short recycle delay ($d$), a long $T_1$ causes the nucleus to not fully return to its equilibrium magnetization between pulses. This phenomenon, known as saturation, leads to a significantly *weaker* signal, not a stronger one. The quaternary carbon signal will be the weakest, not the most intense.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3710475"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the combined qualitative effects, we now isolate one of the primary sources of integration error: differential relaxation.

This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.

An ideal $90^{\\circ}$ pulse rotates any existing longitudinal magnetization into the transverse plane. Therefore, immediately after any such pulse, the longitudinal magnetization is zero. Let $M_{z}^{\\mathrm{ss}}$ be the steady-state longitudinal magnetization immediately *before* a pulse.\nImmediately after the pulse, the magnetization becomes $M_z(0) = M_{z}^{\\mathrm{ss}} \\cos(90^{\\circ}) = 0$.\nDuring the subsequent recycle delay of duration $TR$, the magnetization relaxes from this initial value of $0$.

The total time is the number of scans, $N$, multiplied by the repetition time, $TR$.\n$$\n\\text{Total Time} = N \\times TR\n$$\nUsing the unrounded value for $TR$ for better accuracy:\n$$\n\\text{Total Time} = 128 \\times 69.07755 \\, \\text{s} = 8841.9264 \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nTo express this time in hours, we divide by the number of seconds in an hour ($3600$).\n$$\n\\text{Total Time} = \\frac{8841.9264 \\, \\text{s}}{3600 \\, \\text{s/h}} \\approx 2.45609 \\, \\text{h}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the total experiment time is $2.456 \\, \\text{h}$.\n\nThe two required values are the repetition time $TR=69.08 \\, \\text{s}$ and the total experiment time $2.456 \\, \\text{h}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 69.08  2.456 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3710418"}]}
