Consider a carbon nucleus $(S = \\tfrac{1}{2})$ coupled in the weak-coupling, first-order limit to $n$ equivalent proton spins $(I = \\tfrac{1}{2})$, where the resonance frequency separation among the carbon transitions is large compared to the scalar spin-spin coupling $J$. Assume the following physically realistic conditions: the proton spins are equivalent and noninteracting among themselves except through the common scalar coupling to carbon, the temperature is high enough that all Zeeman product states of the proton spin manifold are equally populated, and the observed transitions correspond to carbon spin flips with the proton spin state unchanged.\n\nStarting from the principles of state counting for $n$ independent spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles and the magnetic dipole selection rules for allowed transitions, determine the unnormalized relative intensities (integer ratios) of the carbon multiplet lines that arise from coupling to the attached protons for three cases: a methine $\\text{CH}$ $(n=1)$, a methylene $\\text{CH}_2$ $(n=2)$, and a methyl $\\text{CH}_3$ $(n=3)$.\n\nReport your final answer as a single row matrix obtained by concatenating, in order, the unnormalized relative intensities for $\\text{CH}$, then $\\text{CH}_2$, then $\\text{CH}_3$.

The analysis is to be performed under the weak-coupling, first-order approximation.\n\nThe splitting of the carbon-13 ($^{13}$C) resonance is caused by the spin-spin interaction, or $J$-coupling, with the directly attached protons ($^{1}$H). The $^{13}$C nucleus has a spin quantum number $S = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the proton has a spin quantum number $I = \\frac{1}{2}$. The number of equivalent protons coupled to the carbon is denoted by $n$.\n\nThe key principle is that the different spin states of the $n$ attached protons create different local magnetic fields at the carbon nucleus, causing the carbon's resonance to split into multiple lines. The problem specifies that the observed transitions correspond to carbon spin flips with the proton spin state unchanged. This corresponds to the magnetic dipole selection rules $\\Delta m_S = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta M_I = 0$, where $m_S$ is the magnetic quantum number of the carbon spin and $M_I$ is the total magnetic quantum number of the system of $n$ proton spins.\n\nBecause $\\Delta M_I = 0$, the carbon nucleus experiences a constant local field contribution from the protons during its transition. A distinct NMR line is observed for each unique value of $M_I$. The total magnetic quantum number for the $n$ equivalent protons is the sum of the individual proton magnetic quantum numbers, $M_I = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{I_i}$. Each proton can be in one of two spin states: spin-up ($\\alpha$), with $m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}$, or spin-down ($\\beta$), with $m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the temperature is high enough that all Zeeman product states of the proton spin manifold are equally populated. This is the standard high-temperature approximation in NMR. Consequently, the relative intensity of each line in the $^{13}$C multiplet is directly proportional to the statistical degeneracy of the corresponding total proton spin state $M_I$. The degeneracy is the number of distinct combinations of individual proton spins ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$) that result in the same total spin quantum number $M_I$.\n\nThis becomes a combinatorial problem. Let $k$ be the number of protons in the spin-up ($\\alpha$) state among the $n$ total protons. The remaining $n-k$ protons must be in the spin-down ($\\beta$) state. The value of $k$ can range from $0$ to $n$.

This coefficient gives the statistical weight, and thus the relative intensity, of the NMR line corresponding to that particular value of $M_I$.\n\nWe will now apply this principle to each case.\n\nCase 1: Methine ($\\text{CH}$, $n=1$)\nFor one proton, $n=1$.

This phenomenon is explained by considering the dynamics of the proton spin in a rotating frame of reference.\n\nFirst, we determine the strength of the decoupling RF field, denoted $\\nu_1$ in frequency units (Hz). This is obtained from the proton nutation experiment. A $90^{\\circ}$ pulse rotates the magnetization by an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians. The rotation angle $\\alpha$ for a pulse of duration $t$ and RF field strength $\\omega_1 = 2\\pi\\nu_1$ is given by $\\alpha = \\omega_1 t$. For the specified $90^{\\circ}$ pulse:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\omega_1 t_{90} = (2\\pi\\nu_1) t_{90} $$\nSolving for $\\nu_1$:\n$$ \\nu_1 = \\frac{1}{4 t_{90}} $$\nGiven $t_{90} = 31.25\\,\\mu\\text{s} = 31.25 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$ \\nu_1 = \\frac{1}{4 \\times 31.25 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = \\frac{1}{125 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = 8000\\,\\text{Hz} $$\n\nNext, we analyze the behavior of the proton spin in its rotating frame. In this frame, which rotates at the frequency of the decoupler RF field, the proton spin experiences an effective magnetic field, $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}$. This field is the vector sum of the RF field $\\vec{B}_1$ (which is static in this frame, conventionally along the x-axis) and a residual field along the z-axis due to the frequency offset, $\\Delta\\nu$. In frequency units, the components of the Larmor frequency vector in this frame are:\n- Component along the x-axis: $\\nu_1 = 8000\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- Component along the z-axis: $\\Delta\\nu = 600\\,\\text{Hz}$\n\nThe magnitude of the effective field, in frequency units, is:\n$$ \\nu_{\\text{eff}} = \\sqrt{(\\nu_1)^2 + (\\Delta\\nu)^2} $$\nThe effective field is tilted with respect to the z-axis (the direction of the main static magnetic field, $B_0$) by an angle $\\theta$. This angle is defined by:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{\\nu_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{\\sqrt{(\\nu_1)^2 + (\\Delta\\nu)^2}} $$\n\nThe scalar coupling interaction is described by the Hamiltonian term $H_J = 2\\pi J_{\\text{CH}} I_z S_z$, where $I_z$ and $S_z$ are the z-components of the spin operators for the $^{13}$C and $^{1}$H nuclei, respectively. Under the off-resonance CW irradiation, the proton spin is \"spin-locked\" along the direction of the effective field $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}$. The secular approximation implies that we only consider the part of the coupling Hamiltonian that is static in the tilted frame where the quantization axis is aligned with $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}$. This is equivalent to taking the time-average of the interaction in the rotating frame, where the rapid precession of the $S_x$ and $S_y$ components around $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}$ averages their contribution to zero.\n\nThe effective interaction is thus proportional to the projection of the proton spin operator $S_z$ onto the new quantization axis (the direction of $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}$). This projection introduces a scaling factor of $\\cos\\theta$. The time-averaged coupling Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$ \\langle H_J \\rangle = 2\\pi J_{\\text{CH}} I_z (S_z \\cos\\theta) = 2\\pi (J_{\\text{CH}}\\cos\\theta) I_z S_z $$\nFrom this, we identify the observed or residual coupling, $J_{\\text{eff}}$, as:\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} = J_{\\text{CH}} \\cos\\theta $$\n\nCombining the expressions, we get the formula for the residual coupling:\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} = J_{\\text{CH}} \\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{\\sqrt{(\\nu_1)^2 + (\\Delta\\nu)^2}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $J_{\\text{CH}} = 155\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- $\\Delta\\nu = 600\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- $\\nu_1 = 8000\\,\\text{Hz}$\n\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} = 155 \\times \\frac{600}{\\sqrt{(8000)^2 + (600)^2}} $$\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} = 155 \\times \\frac{600}{\\sqrt{64000000 + 360000}} $$\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} = 155 \\times \\frac{600}{\\sqrt{64360000}} $$\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} = 155 \\times \\frac{600}{8022.4684...} $$\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} = 155 \\times 0.0747900... $$\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} = 11.59245... \\,\\text{Hz} $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$ J_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 11.59\\,\\text{Hz} $$\nThe expected residual coupling is $11.59\\,\\text{Hz}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{11.59}\n$$", "id": "3716570"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical predictions are only useful if they can be confirmed by observation.
