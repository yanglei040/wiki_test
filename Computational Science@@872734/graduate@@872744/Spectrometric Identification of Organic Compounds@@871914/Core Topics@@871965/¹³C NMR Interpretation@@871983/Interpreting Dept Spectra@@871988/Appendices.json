The pulse sequence is standard for DEPT, and three proton flip-angle settings are used: DEPT-$45^\\circ$, DEPT-$90^\\circ$, and DEPT-$135^\\circ$. By convention, spectra are phased so that methine carbon ($\\text{CH}$) signals in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ appear upward, and the same phasing is applied to DEPT-$135^\\circ$ for sign comparison. Assume standard acquisition conditions: continuous proton decoupling during carbon acquisition, uniform phase cycling to suppress unwanted coherences, and negligible differential relaxation over the short transfer delays.\n\nThe foundational physical basis you may use is limited to the following well-tested facts and definitions: in pulsed NMR, radiofrequency pulses rotate nuclear magnetization vectors in a manner determined by pulse flip angle and phase; polarization transfer in the DEPT sequence occurs via one-bond scalar coupling $J_{\\text{CH}}$ between carbon and directly attached hydrogen nuclei; signals in DEPT experiments arise only from carbons that carry directly bonded protons, and their observed phase (up/down) depends on the number of attached protons and the chosen proton flip angle, whereas quaternary carbons (no directly attached hydrogens) do not produce DEPT signals.\n\nYou are given a hypothetical dataset of four ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ resonances from a single compound with the following observed patterns:\n\n- Resonance $R_1$ at $\\delta = 30.5$ ppm: present in DEPT-$45^\\circ$, absent in DEPT-$90^\\circ$, and appears downward in DEPT-$135^\\circ$.\n- Resonance $R_2$ at $\\delta = 14.2$ ppm: present in DEPT-$45^\\circ$, absent in DEPT-$90^\\circ$, and appears upward in DEPT-$135^\\circ$.\n- Resonance $R_3$ at $\\delta = 128.3$ ppm: present in DEPT-$45^\\circ$, present in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ (upward), and appears upward in DEPT-$135^\\circ$.\n- Resonance $R_4$ at $\\delta = 172.1$ ppm: present in the broadband decoupled ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ spectrum, absent in all DEPT experiments.\n\nStarting from the physical basis stated above, reason about how the number of directly attached protons controls whether a carbon resonance appears or is suppressed in each DEPT experiment and how its phase (upward versus downward) is determined at different proton flip angles.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Solution\n\nThe core of the DEPT experiment is that the intensity and phase of a ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ signal are modulated by a function of the final proton pulse flip angle, $\\theta$, and the number of protons, $n$, attached to that carbon. The standard, empirically-validated behavior for different carbon multiplicities under the specified phasing convention (CH signal in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ is positive/upward) is as follows:\n\nLet 'Upward' correspond to a positive signal intensity and 'Downward' to a negative signal intensity. The signal is 'Absent' if its intensity is zero.\n\n1.  **Quaternary Carbon (C):** Having no directly attached protons ($n=0$), it cannot participate in the one-bond polarization transfer.\n    - Signal: **Absent** in DEPT-$45^\\circ$, DEPT-$90^\\circ$, and DEPT-$135^\\circ$.\n\n2.  **Methine Carbon ($\\text{CH}$):** Has one attached proton ($n=1$).\n    - DEPT-$45^\\circ$: Signal is positive. **Upward**.\n    - DEPT-$90^\\circ$: Signal is positive. **Upward**.

The absence in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ excludes $\\text{CH}$. The downward phase in DEPT-$135^\\circ$ is uniquely characteristic of a $\\text{CH}_2$ group.\n  - Assignment: **$\\text{CH}_2$** (Methylene)\n\n- **Resonance $R_2$ ($\\delta = 14.2$ ppm):** Present in DEPT-$45^\\circ$, absent in DEPT-$90^\\circ$, and upward in DEPT-$135^\\circ$. The absence in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ excludes $\\text{CH}$. The upward phase in DEPT-$135^\\circ$ for a signal that is absent in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ is uniquely characteristic of a $\\text{CH}_3$ group.\n  - Assignment: **$\\text{CH}_3$** (Methyl)\n\n- **Resonance $R_3$ ($\\delta = 128.3$ ppm):** Present and upward in DEPT-$90^\\circ$. This is uniquely characteristic of a $\\text{CH}$ group. The other observations (present in DEPT-$45^\\circ$, upward in DEPT-$135^\\circ$) are consistent with this assignment.\n  - Assignment: **$\\text{CH}$** (Methine)\n\n- **Resonance $R_4$ ($\\delta = 172.1$ ppm):** Present in the broadband ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ spectrum but absent in all DEPT experiments. This is the definition of a quaternary carbon.\n  - Assignment: **C** (Quaternary)\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate each proposed decision tree.\n\n**A. First, check presence in DEPT-$45^\\circ$: if absent, assign quaternary; if present, check DEPT-$90^\\circ$: if present (upward), assign CH; if absent from DEPT-$90^\\circ$, check DEPT-$135^\\circ$: if upward, assign CH$_3$; if downward, assign CH$_2$. This tree assumes CH and CH$_3$ appear upward and CH$_2$ downward in DEPT-$135^\\circ$ under the stated phasing.**\n\n- **Analysis of Logic:** This decision tree is entirely consistent with our derived rules.\n    1.  A signal present in the broadband spectrum but absent in DEPT-$45^\\circ$ must be quaternary, as all protonated carbons ($\\text{CH}$, $\\text{CH}_2$, $\\text{CH}_3$) appear in DEPT-$45^\\circ$. This correctly identifies $R_4$.\n    2.  If present in DEPT-$45^\\circ$, checking DEPT-$90^\\circ$ is the next logical step. A signal present in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ is definitively a $\\text{CH}$. This correctly identifies $R_3$.\n    3.  If absent from DEPT-$90^\\circ$, the carbon must be either $\\text{CH}_2$ or $\\text{CH}_3$.\n    4.  Checking the phase in DEPT-$135^\\circ$ cleanly separates these two possibilities: upward for $\\text{CH}_3$ (correctly identifying $R_2$) and downward for $\\text{CH}_2$ (correctly identifying $R_1$).\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. The logic is sound, systematic, and correctly classifies all given resonances.\n\n**B. First, check DEPT-$90^\\circ$: if present (upward), assign CH$_3$; if absent, check DEPT-$45^\\circ$: if present, assign CH; otherwise assign quaternary; then use DEPT-$135^\\circ$ only to confirm intensity, not phase, because phase is unreliable across instruments.**\n\n- **Analysis of Logic:** This option contains multiple fundamental errors.\n    1.  The first step is incorrect: a signal present in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ is a $\\text{CH}$, not a $\\text{CH}_3$.\n    2.  The statement that the phase of DEPT-$135^\\circ$ is unreliable and should not be used is factually wrong; the phase is the critical diagnostic feature for distinguishing $\\text{CH}_2$ from $\\text{CH}_3$ and is reliable under standard conditions.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. First, check DEPT-$45^\\circ$: if present (upward), assign CH only; if present (downward), assign CH$_2$; if absent, assign CH$_3$; use DEPT-$90^\\circ$ solely to identify quaternary carbons as those that are present in the broadband ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ spectrum but completely absent in DEPT-$90^\\circ$.**\n\n- **Analysis of Logic:** This option is riddled with errors.\n    1.  In a DEPT-$45^\\circ$ spectrum, all protonated carbons ($\\text{CH}$, $\\text{CH}_2$, $\\text{CH}_3$) appear upward. The tree incorrectly claims only $\\text{CH}$ appears and that $\\text{CH}_2$ signals are downward. No signals are downward in DEPT-$45^\\circ$.\n    2.  It incorrectly states that if a signal is absent from DEPT-$45^\\circ$, it is a $\\text{CH}_3$. An absent signal is a quaternary carbon.\n    3.  The rule for identifying quaternary carbons is flawed. Since $\\text{CH}_2$ and $\\text{CH}_3$ are also absent in DEPT-$90^\\circ$, this rule would misclassify them as quaternary.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. First, check the broadband ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ spectrum: if present, assume the resonance is protonated because long-range coupling can leak into DEPT; then use DEPT-$135^\\circ$ phase: downward is CH$_3$, upward is CH$_2$; use DEPT-$90^\\circ$ to distinguish quaternary carbons as those that are present in DEPT-$135^\\circ$ but absent in DEPT-$90^\\circ$.**\n\n- **Analysis of Logic:** This option is illogical and factually incorrect.\n    1.  The initial assumption that any signal in a broadband spectrum is protonated is false; quaternary carbons are not protonated. Invoking long-range coupling as a basis for a primary decision tree contradicts the fundamental principle of DEPT, which relies on one-bond coupling.\n    2.  The phase assignments for DEPT-$135^\\circ$ are reversed: it states downward is $\\text{CH}_3$ and upward is $\\text{CH}_2$, when the opposite is true ($\\text{CH}_2$ is downward, $\\text{CH}_3$ is upward).\n    3.  The rule for identifying quaternary carbons is nonsensical. A signal present in DEPT-$135^\\circ$ is by definition protonated and therefore cannot be quaternary.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A provides a correct and logically sound decision tree for interpreting DEPT spectra that is consistent with the provided data and fundamental principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3708157"}, {"introduction": "While the rules for interpreting DEPT spectra are powerful, they rely on idealized experimental conditions.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the solution process can proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution is derived by first establishing the analytical form of the ratio $R(\\alpha)$, then calculating its value at the nominal angle and at the angles corresponding to the error bounds, and finally computing the required fractional deviations to find the maximum.\n\n#### Step 2.1: Formulate the Ratio $R(\\alpha)$\n\nThe amplitudes for the methine ($n=1$) and methylene ($n=2$) groups are:\n$A_{1}(\\alpha) \\propto \\sin\\alpha (\\cos\\alpha)^{1-1} = \\sin\\alpha$\n$A_{2}(\\alpha) \\propto \\sin\\alpha (\\cos\\alpha)^{2-1} = \\sin\\alpha \\cos\\alpha$\n\nThe constant of proportionality is identical for both and cancels in the ratio. The ratio $R(\\alpha)$ is defined using the magnitudes of these amplitudes:\n$$R(\\alpha) = \\frac{|A_{1}(\\alpha)|}{|A_{2}(\\alpha)|} = \\frac{|\\sin\\alpha|}{|\\sin\\alpha \\cos\\alpha|} = \\frac{|\\sin\\alpha|}{|\\sin\\alpha| |\\cos\\alpha|}$$\nFor the range of angles around $135^{\\circ}$ (specifically, from $130^{\\circ}$ to $140^{\\circ}$), $\\sin\\alpha$ is non-zero. Thus, we can simplify the expression:\n$$R(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{|\\cos\\alpha|}$$\n\n#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Reference Ratio\n\nThe nominal angle is $\\alpha_{0} = 135^{\\circ}$. The reference ratio, $R(135^{\\circ})$, is:\n$$R(135^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{|\\cos(135^{\\circ})|}$$\nThe cosine of $135^{\\circ}$ is $\\cos(135^{\\circ}) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n$$R(135^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{|-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}|} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$$\n\n#### Step 2.3: Calculate Ratios at the Error Bounds\n\nThe calibration error is $\\Delta\\alpha = \\pm 5^{\\circ}$. We must evaluate $R(\\alpha)$ at $\\alpha = 135^{\\circ} + 5^{\\circ} = 140^{\\circ}$ and $\\alpha = 135^{\\circ} - 5^{\\circ} = 130^{\\circ}$.\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha_{+} = 140^{\\circ}$\n$$R(140^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{|\\cos(140^{\\circ})|}$$\nSince $140^{\\circ}$ is in the second quadrant, $\\cos(140^{\\circ})$ is negative. Therefore, $|\\cos(140^{\\circ})| = -\\cos(140^{\\circ})$. Using the identity $-\\cos(\\theta) = \\cos(180^{\\circ}-\\theta)$:\n$$R(140^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{-\\cos(140^{\\circ})} = \\frac{1}{\\cos(180^{\\circ}-140^{\\circ})} = \\frac{1}{\\cos(40^{\\circ})}$$\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha_{-} = 130^{\\circ}$\n$$R(130^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{|\\cos(130^{\\circ})|}$$\nSimilarly, $130^{\\circ}$ is in the second quadrant, so $\\cos(130^{\\circ})$ is negative.\n$$R(130^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{-\\cos(130^{\\circ})} = \\frac{1}{\\cos(180^{\\circ}-130^{\\circ})} = \\frac{1}{\\cos(50^{\\circ})}$$\n\n#### Step 2.4: Calculate Fractional Deviations\n\nThe fractional deviation for a given $\\Delta\\alpha$ is $\\delta(\\Delta\\alpha) = \\left| \\frac{R(135^{\\circ}+\\Delta\\alpha) - R(135^{\\circ})}{R(135^{\\circ})} \\right|$.\n\nFor $\\Delta\\alpha = +5^{\\circ}$:\n$$\\delta_{+} = \\left| \\frac{R(140^{\\circ}) - R(135^{\\circ})}{R(135^{\\circ})} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\cos(40^{\\circ})} - \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\cos(40^{\\circ})} - 1 \\right|$$\n\nFor $\\Delta\\alpha = -5^{\\circ}$:\n$$\\delta_{-} = \\left| \\frac{R(130^{\\circ}) - R(135^{\\circ})}{R(135^{\\circ})} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\cos(50^{\\circ})} - \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\cos(50^{\\circ})} - 1 \\right|$$\n\n#### Step 2.5: Determine the Maximum Deviation\n\nTo find $\\delta_{\\max} = \\max(\\delta_{+}, \\delta_{-})$, we must compare the two values. The function $f(x) = \\cos(x)$ is decreasing for $x \\in [0^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}]$. Since $40^{\\circ} < 45^{\\circ} < 50^{\\circ}$, we have $\\cos(40^{\\circ}) > \\cos(45^{\\circ}) > \\cos(50^{\\circ})$.\nWe know $\\cos(45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{2}\\cos(40^{\\circ}) > 1$ and $\\sqrt{2}\\cos(50^{\\circ}) < 1$.\n\nThis allows us to resolve the absolute values:\n$\\delta_{+} = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\cos(40^{\\circ})} - 1 \\right| = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\cos(40^{\\circ})}$\n$\\delta_{-} = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\cos(50^{\\circ})} - 1 \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\cos(50^{\\circ})} - 1$\n\nThe function $R(\\alpha) = 1/|\\cos\\alpha|$ is convex on the interval $(90^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ})$. This implies that for a fixed step size $\\Delta\\alpha$, the change $|R(\\alpha_0 - \\Delta\\alpha) - R(\\alpha_0)|$ will be greater than $|R(\\alpha_0 + \\Delta\\alpha) - R(\\alpha_0)|$ because the function's slope is steeper at $\\alpha_0 - \\Delta\\alpha$ than at $\\alpha_0 + \\Delta\\alpha$.

It is a standard problem in the quantitative analysis of NMR pulse sequences, specifically DEPT spectroscopy. All required data and conditions are provided, and the tasks are logically structured, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for several derivations and calculations related to the INEPT evolution delay, $\\Delta$, in the context of a DEPT experiment. The overall process will be broken down into: 1. Deriving the optimal delay $\\Delta$ for a single ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$-${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ pair. 2. Calculating this delay for two specific types of carbon sites. 3. Deriving and calculating a compromise delay $\\Delta$ that provides the best combined efficiency for both sites. 4. Discussing the practical consequences of using this compromise delay.\n\nFirst, we determine the condition for $\\Delta$ that maximizes the creation of antiphase magnetization. The essential part of the INEPT sequence involves the evolution of transverse ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ magnetization under the scalar coupling Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H} = 2 \\pi J_{CH} \\hat{I}_{z} \\hat{S}_{z}$. Let us consider the initial state to be transverse ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ magnetization, for instance, represented by the product operator $\\hat{I}_x$. The evolution of this state over a period $\\Delta$ is given by the transformation:\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}(0) = \\hat{I}_x \\xrightarrow{\\hat{H}\\Delta} \\hat{\\sigma}(\\Delta) = \\exp(-i \\hat{H} \\Delta) \\hat{I}_x \\exp(i \\hat{H} \\Delta) $$\nUsing the commutation relations for spin angular momentum operators, the evolved state is:\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}(\\Delta) = \\hat{I}_x \\cos(2 \\pi J_{CH} \\Delta \\hat{S}_z) - \\hat{I}_y \\sin(2 \\pi J_{CH} \\Delta \\hat{S}_z) $$\nFor a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ nucleus like ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, the operator functions can be expanded as $\\cos(A \\hat{S}_z) = \\cos(A/2)$ and $\\sin(A \\hat{S}_z) = 2 \\hat{S}_z \\sin(A/2)$. Applying these identities with $A = 2 \\pi J_{CH} \\Delta$, we get:\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}(\\Delta) = \\hat{I}_x \\cos(\\pi J_{CH} \\Delta) - 2 \\hat{I}_y \\hat{S}_z \\sin(\\pi J_{CH} \\Delta) $$\nThe term $-2 \\hat{I}_y \\hat{S}_z$ represents antiphase magnetization of spin $\\hat{I}$ with respect to spin $\\hat{S}$. The creation of this state is a crucial step for polarization transfer. The amplitude of this term is proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J_{CH} \\Delta)$. To maximize this transfer, we must maximize the magnitude of this amplitude, which occurs when $|\\sin(\\pi J_{CH} \\Delta)| = 1$. The first maximum for $\\Delta > 0$ is achieved when:\n$$ \\pi J_{CH} \\Delta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nThis gives the well-known condition for the optimal evolution delay:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2 J_{CH}} $$\n\nNext, we apply this condition to the two given sites.\nFor the aliphatic $\\text{CH}$ site with $J_a = 135\\ \\text{Hz}$:\n$$ \\Delta_a = \\frac{1}{2 J_a} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 135} = \\frac{1}{270}\\ \\text{s} $$\nFor the vinylic $\\text{CH}$ site with $J_v = 165\\ \\text{Hz}$:\n$$ \\Delta_v = \\frac{1}{2 J_v} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 165} = \\frac{1}{330}\\ \\text{s} $$\n\nNow, we consider a single compromise delay, $\\Delta$, for both sites. The problem defines a combined-efficiency metric, $E(\\Delta)$, as the sum of the squared magnitudes of the antiphase transfer amplitudes. Based on our derivation, the amplitude is proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)$, so the objective function to maximize is:\n$$ E(\\Delta) = \\sin^2(\\pi J_a \\Delta) + \\sin^2(\\pi J_v \\Delta) $$\nTo find the maximum, we could take the derivative of $E(\\Delta)$ with respect to $\\Delta$ and set it to zero. However, the problem suggests an approximation method: \"working to leading order in small deviations around the individual optima\". This implies that the compromise delay $\\Delta$ will be close to both $\\Delta_a$ and $\\Delta_v$.\n\nLet's analyze the efficiency loss for each site when using a non-optimal delay. The efficiency is $\\sin^2(\\pi J \\Delta)$. The maximum efficiency is $1$ (when $\\pi J \\Delta = \\pi/2$). The loss of efficiency is $1 - \\sin^2(\\pi J \\Delta) = \\cos^2(\\pi J \\Delta)$. We want to minimize the total loss from both sites, which is $L(\\Delta) = \\cos^2(\\pi J_a \\Delta) + \\cos^2(\\pi J_v \\Delta)$.\n\nLet the sought-after compromise delay be $\\Delta_{opt}$. For a site $i$ (where $i=a$ or $v$), we can write $\\Delta_{opt} = \\Delta_i + \\delta_i$, where $\\delta_i$ is a small deviation. The argument of the cosine becomes $\\pi J_i \\Delta_{opt} = \\pi J_i (\\Delta_i + \\delta_i) = \\pi J_i (\\frac{1}{2J_i}) + \\pi J_i \\delta_i = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\pi J_i \\delta_i$.\nSo, $\\cos(\\pi J_i \\Delta_{opt}) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\pi J_i \\delta_i) = -\\sin(\\pi J_i \\delta_i)$.\nFor small deviations $\\delta_i$, we can use the Taylor expansion $\\sin(x) \\approx x$. Thus, $\\cos(\\pi J_i \\Delta_{opt}) \\approx -\\pi J_i \\delta_i = -\\pi J_i (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_i)$.\nThe loss function, to leading order in these small deviations, is:\n$$ L(\\Delta_{opt}) \\approx (-\\pi J_a (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_a))^2 + (-\\pi J_v (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_v))^2 $$\n$$ L(\\Delta_{opt}) \\approx \\pi^2 [ J_a^2 (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_a)^2 + J_v^2 (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_v)^2 ] $$\nTo minimize this loss, we take its derivative with respect to $\\Delta_{opt}$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dL}{d\\Delta_{opt}} = 2 \\pi^2 [ J_a^2 (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_a) + J_v^2 (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_v) ] = 0 $$\n$$ J_a^2 (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_a) + J_v^2 (\\Delta_{opt} - \\Delta_v) = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\Delta_{opt}$:\n$$ \\Delta_{opt} (J_a^2 + J_v^2) = J_a^2 \\Delta_a + J_v^2 \\Delta_v $$\n$$ \\Delta_{opt} = \\frac{J_a^2 \\Delta_a + J_v^2 \\Delta_v}{J_a^2 + J_v^2} $$\nThis expression shows that the optimal compromise delay is a weighted average of the individual optimal delays $\\Delta_a$ and $\\Delta_v$, with the weights being the square of the corresponding coupling constants, $J_a^2$ and $J_v^2$.\nNow, we substitute $\\Delta_a = 1/(2J_a)$ and $\\Delta_v = 1/(2J_v)$:\n$$ \\Delta_{opt} = \\frac{J_a^2 (\\frac{1}{2J_a}) + J_v^2 (\\frac{1}{2J_v})}{J_a^2 + J_v^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}J_a + \\frac{1}{2}J_v}{J_a^2 + J_v^2} = \\frac{J_a + J_v}{2(J_a^2 + J_v^2)} $$\nWe can now compute the numerical value for $\\Delta_{opt}$ using $J_a = 135\\ \\text{Hz}$ and $J_v = 165\\ \\text{Hz}$.\n$$ \\Delta_{opt} = \\frac{135 + 165}{2(135^2 + 165^2)} = \\frac{300}{2(18225 + 27225)} = \\frac{300}{2(45450)} = \\frac{300}{90900} = \\frac{1}{303}\\ \\text{s} $$\nTo express this in milliseconds:\n$$ \\Delta_{opt} = \\frac{1}{303} \\ \\text{s} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\text{ms}}{1 \\ \\text{s}} \\approx 3.30033\\ \\text{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the compromise delay is $3.300\\ \\text{ms}$.\n\nFinally, we comment on the consequences of using this compromise delay.\n1.  **Signal Attenuation**: Neither signal will be at its theoretical maximum intensity. The efficiency for each site is given by $\\sin^2(\\pi J \\Delta_{opt})$.\n    For the aliphatic site ($J_a = 135\\ \\text{Hz}$):\n    Efficiency$_a = \\sin^2(\\pi \\times 135 \\times \\frac{1}{303}) = \\sin^2(\\frac{135\\pi}{303}) \\approx \\sin^2(1.399) \\approx 0.9853^2 \\approx 0.9708$.\n    This represents an intensity loss of approximately $100\\% - 97.08\\% = 2.92\\%$.\n    For the vinylic site ($J_v = 165\\ \\text{Hz}$):\n    Efficiency$_v = \\sin^2(\\pi \\times 165 \\times \\frac{1}{303}) = \\sin^2(\\frac{165\\pi}{303}) \\approx \\sin^2(1.710) \\approx 0.9903^2 \\approx 0.9807$.\n    This represents an intensity loss of approximately $100\\% - 98.07\\% = 1.93\\%$.\n    Both signals are slightly attenuated, but the overall signal loss across both types of sites is minimized by this choice of $\\Delta$.\n\n2.  **Relative Bias**: The attenuation is not uniform. The vinylic site is less attenuated than the aliphatic one. This introduces a quantitative bias in the relative signal intensities. The ratio of the observed intensities, assuming an equal number of nuclei and identical relaxation properties, would be:\n    $$ \\frac{\\text{Intensity}_v}{\\text{Intensity}_a} = \\frac{\\text{Efficiency}_v}{\\text{Efficiency}_a} = \\frac{0.9807}{0.9708} \\approx 1.010 $$\n    The vinylic $\\text{CH}$ signal will be artificially enhanced by about $1.0\\%$ relative to the aliphatic $\\text{CH}$ signal. This is because the optimization procedure gives more weight ($J_i^2$) to the site with the larger coupling constant ($J_v$), pulling the compromise delay $\\Delta_{opt}$ closer to its individual optimum $\\Delta_v$. For accurate quantitative measurements, this frequency-dependent efficiency factor must be taken into account.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.300}\n$$", "id": "3708145"}]}
