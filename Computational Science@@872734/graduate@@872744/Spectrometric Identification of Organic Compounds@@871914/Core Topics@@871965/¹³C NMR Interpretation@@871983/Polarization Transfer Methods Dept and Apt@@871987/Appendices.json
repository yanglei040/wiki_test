The behavior of carbon signals as a function of the number of attached protons ($n$) and the final proton flip angle ($\\beta$) is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics applied to nuclear spin systems. The stated phase convention for DEPT-$135$ is the most common one used in practice and corresponds to the natural phase behavior of the signals. While the specification of the INEPT delay as $\\tau = 1/(4J_{\\mathrm{CH}})$ is an incomplete description of the full DEPT pulse sequence timing, the problem circumvents any potential ambiguity by explicitly defining the expected signs of the signals in the DEPT-$135$ spectrum. This makes the problem solvable based on the provided outcomes, which are standard and correct.

This is a routine analytical procedure.\n5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: None. The problem is well-structured and leads to a definitive answer.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial**: None.

The logic can be rigorously verified.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n#### Principle of the DEPT Experiment\nThe DEPT pulse sequence transfers polarization from attached protons ($^{1}$H) to a carbon nucleus ($^{13}$C). The resulting $^{13}$C signal intensity depends on the number of attached protons, $n$, and the angle, $\\beta$, of the final proton pulse in the sequence. For a $\\mathrm{CH}_n$ group, the edited signal intensity is proportional to a function of $\\beta$. Quaternary carbons (C, $n=0$) have no attached protons and thus show no signal in any DEPT spectrum.\n\nUnder the standard implementation and the phase convention specified in the problem, the theoretical signal properties for each carbon type in the three DEPT experiments are as follows:\n\n| Carbon Type ($n$) | Signal Behavior in DEPT-$45$ ($\\beta = 45^\\circ$) | Signal Behavior in DEPT-$90$ ($\\beta = 90^\\circ$) | Signal Behavior in DEPT-$135$ ($\\beta = 135^\\circ$) |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| $\\mathrm{CH}$ ($n=1$) | Present, Positive ($+$) | Present, Positive ($+$) | Present, Positive ($+$) |\n| $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ ($n=2$) | Present, Positive ($+$) | Absent ($0$) | Present, Negative ($-$) |\n| $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ ($n=3$) | Present, Positive ($+$) | Absent ($0$) | Present, Positive ($+$) |\n| Quaternary, C ($n=0$) | Absent ($0$) | Absent ($0$) | Absent ($0$) |\n\nThe broadband-decoupled $^{13}$C spectrum shows all carbon peaks ($\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{CH}$, $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, $\\mathrm{CH}_3$). The task is to use the information in the table above to create a sorting algorithm.\n\n#### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Decision tree:**\n- **Step 1: If a peak appears in DEPT-$90$, assign CH.**\nBased on the table, only $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons produce a signal in the DEPT-$90$ spectrum. This step correctly and uniquely identifies all $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons.\n- **Step 2: Else, if the peak appears in DEPT-$45$ and is positive in DEPT-$135$, assign CH$_3$.**\nThe 'Else' clause restricts this rule to carbons that are not $\\mathrm{CH}$ (i.e., $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, $\\mathrm{CH}_3$, and C). The condition \"appears in DEPT-$45$\" eliminates quaternary carbons (C). We are left considering $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ and $\\mathrm{CH}_3$. The condition \"is positive in DEPT-$135$\" selects for $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ and excludes $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ (which is negative). This step correctly identifies all $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ carbons.\n- **Step 3: Else, if the peak appears in DEPT-$45$ and is negative in DEPT-$135$, assign CH$_2$.**\nThe 'Else' clause restricts this to carbons not assigned in steps 1 or 2 (i.e., not $\\mathrm{CH}$ or $\\mathrm{CH}_3$). The remaining types are $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ and C. The condition \"appears in DEPT-$45$\" eliminates C. The condition \"is negative in DEPT-$135$\" is uniquely characteristic of $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ carbons among the remaining possibilities. This step correctly identifies all $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ carbons.\n- **Step 4: Else, if the peak is absent in DEPT-$45$, assign quaternary.**\nThe 'Else' clause implies this rule applies to any peak not assigned as $\\mathrm{CH}$, $\\mathrm{CH}_2$, or $\\mathrm{CH}_3$. The only remaining type is quaternary carbon (C). Quaternary carbons are, by definition, absent from all DEPT spectra, including DEPT-$45$. This step correctly identifies all quaternary carbons.\n\nThe algorithm is sequential, with each step handling a mutually exclusive subset of peaks. It correctly and unambiguously assigns all carbon types.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Decision tree:**\n- **Step 1: If a peak appears in DEPT-$90$, it is either CH or CH$_3$;...**\nThis premise is factually incorrect. According to the principles of the experiment, only $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons appear in the DEPT-$90$ spectrum; $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ carbons give a null signal. The algorithm fails at the first step.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Decision tree:**\n- **Step 1: Use DEPT-$135$ sign alone: positive $\\Rightarrow \\mathrm{CH}$,...**\nThis rule is ambiguous. According to the table, both $\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ resonances are positive in the DEPT-$135$ spectrum. Therefore, a positive signal in DEPT-$135$ alone cannot be used to definitively assign a peak as $\\mathrm{CH}$. The algorithm fails to provide a deterministic assignment.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Decision tree:**\n- **Step 1: Assign peaks that are negative in DEPT-$135$ as quaternary.**\nThis is incorrect. A negative signal in DEPT-$135$ is the unique signature of a $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ group. Quaternary carbons (C) are absent from all DEPT spectra. The algorithm fails at the first step.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Set-theoretic classifier:**\nLet us define the sets based on the provided data:\n- $U$: The set of all peaks in the broadband-decoupled spectrum, i.e., all $\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3$ peaks.\n- $P = \\{\\text{peaks present in DEPT-45}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$ peaks.\n- $Q = \\{\\text{peaks present in DEPT-90}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}\\}$ peaks.\n- $R^{+} = \\{\\text{peaks positive in DEPT-135}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$ peaks.\n- $R^{-} = \\{\\text{peaks negative in DEPT-135}\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}_2\\}$ peaks.\n\nNow we evaluate the proposed assignments:\n- **$\\mathrm{CH} = Q$**: This assigns $\\mathrm{CH}$ to the set of peaks present in DEPT-$90$. This is correct, as $Q$ contains only $\\mathrm{CH}$ peaks.\n- **$\\mathrm{CH}_3 = (P \\setminus Q)\\cap R^{+}$**: The set $P \\setminus Q$ represents peaks present in DEPT-$45$ but absent in DEPT-$90$. This corresponds to the set of $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$ peaks. Intersecting this set with $R^{+}$ (peaks positive in DEPT-$135$, i.e., $\\{\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$) yields: $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\} \\cap \\{\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$. This correctly identifies the set of $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ peaks.\n- **$\\mathrm{CH}_2 = (P \\setminus Q)\\cap R^{-}$**: The set $P \\setminus Q$ is $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\}$. Intersecting this with $R^{-}$ (peaks negative in DEPT-$135$, i.e., $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2\\}$) yields: $\\{\\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}_3\\} \\cap \\{\\mathrm{CH}_2\\} = \\{\\mathrm{CH}_2\\}$. This correctly identifies the set of $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ peaks.\n- **$\\text{quaternary} = \\text{complement of }P\\text{ in the broadband-decoupled }^{13}\\mathrm{C}\\text{ spectrum}$**: The complement of $P$ in the universe of all peaks $U$ is $U \\setminus P$. This is the set of peaks that appear in the broadband-decoupled spectrum but not in the DEPT-$45$ spectrum. From our table, only quaternary carbons (C) fit this description. This correctly identifies the set of quaternary carbon peaks.\n\nThe set of definitions provides a complete and non-overlapping partition of all carbon peaks into the four categories.\n**Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "3718617"}, {"introduction": "Ideal textbook examples assume perfect experimental conditions, but in the laboratory, imperfections are the norm.

The APT phase report must be incorrect because ethanol contains a quaternary carbon near $\\delta \\approx 58\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$; therefore the inverted DEPT-$135^\\circ$ peak at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ corresponds to a quaternary site, not $\\mathrm{CH_2}$.", "solution": "The user wants me to validate the problem statement according to the specified rules, and if it is valid, to solve it by deriving the correct answer and evaluating each option.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   **Molecule**: Ethanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$), with a methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$) and a methylene ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$) carbon.\n-   **Spectrometer Frequencies**: $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Larmor frequency $= 125\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ Larmor frequency $= 500\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$.\n-   **DEPT Parameters**:\n    -   Pulse sequence type: Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT), INEPT-style evolution.\n    -   Delay $\\tau = 1/(2 J_{\\mathrm{ref}})$.\n    -   Reference coupling $J_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 135\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   Proton flip angles $\\theta = 45^\\circ$, $90^\\circ$, $135^\\circ$.\n    -   Systematic error in $\\theta$: $\\pm 5^\\circ$.\n    -   Acquisition: Broadband proton decoupling applied.\n-   **DEPT Spectral Data** (phased so expected positive signals are upright):\n    -   DEPT-$45^\\circ$: Upright signal at $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (rel. int. $1.00$), upright signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (rel. int. $0.55$).\n    -   DEPT-$90^\\circ$: Very weak upright signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (rel. int. $0.08$), no feature at $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n    -   DEPT-$135^\\circ$: Upright signal at $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (rel. int. $0.95$), inverted signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (rel. int. $0.70$).\n-   **APT Spectral Data**:\n    -   One upright signal at $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n    -   One inverted signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n-   **Molecular Parameters**:\n    -   One-bond scalar couplings: $^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH_3}} \\approx 125\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} \\approx 140\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   Relaxation parameters: $T_1(\\mathrm{CH_3}) \\approx 2.3\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $T_1(\\mathrm{CH_2}) \\approx 1.6\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_3}) \\approx 0.12\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_2}) \\approx 0.08\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is set in the context of NMR spectroscopy, a standard analytical technique. Ethanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$) indeed has one $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and one $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group. The provided chemical shifts ($\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ for an aliphatic $\\mathrm{CH_3}$, $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ for a $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ bonded to an electronegative oxygen) are chemically reasonable. The Larmor frequencies are consistent with a high-field NMR spectrometer (approx. $11.7\\,\\mathrm{Tesla}$). The scalar coupling constants ($^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$) and relaxation times ($T_1, T_2$) are physically realistic values for a small molecule like ethanol under these conditions.

It is a valid scientific problem. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts: first, the unambiguous assignment of the two carbon signals using the provided spectral data; second, a physical explanation for the observed non-ideal behavior in the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ spectrum.\n\n**1. Assignment of Carbon Signals**\n\nThe ethanol molecule, $\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$, has two protonated carbons: a methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$) group and a methylene ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$) group.\n\n-   **Chemical Shift**: The carbon atom bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$) is expected to be deshielded and resonate at a higher chemical shift (downfield) compared to the terminal methyl group ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$). Thus, we anticipate $\\delta(\\mathrm{CH_2})  \\delta(\\mathrm{CH_3})$. This suggests the assignment: $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ carbon, and $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ carbon.\n\n-   **APT (Attached Proton Test)**: This experiment differentiates carbons based on the parity of the number of attached protons. For typical phasing, carbons with an odd number of protons ($\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH_3}$) produce a positive (upright) signal, while carbons with an even number of protons ($\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{CH_2}$) produce a negative (inverted) signal. The data shows an upright signal at $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and an inverted signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This confirms the assignment: $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ (odd, $n=3$), and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ (even, $n=2$).\n\n-   **DEPT-135**: This experiment provides more specific multiplicity information. With an editing pulse angle of $\\theta = 135^\\circ$, $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\mathrm{CH}$ groups yield positive signals, while $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ groups yield negative signals. The observed upright signal at $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and inverted signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ are perfectly consistent with the assignment of $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ to $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ to $\\mathrm{CH_2}$.\n\n-   **DEPT-45**: With $\\theta=45^\\circ$, all protonated carbons ($\\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{CH_2}, \\mathrm{CH_3}$) should give positive signals. The observation of two upright signals is consistent with the presence of two protonated carbons.\n\nAll consistent evidence points to the assignment:\n-   $\\mathbf{\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}}$ corresponds to the **$\\mathrm{CH_3}$** group.\n-   $\\mathbf{\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}}$ corresponds to the **$\\mathrm{CH_2}$** group.\n\n**2. Analysis of the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ Spectrum**\n\nThe DEPT experiment edits signals based on the number of attached protons, $n$, through the final proton pulse angle $\\theta$. The signal intensity for a given multiplicity, ignoring relaxation and $J$-mismatch scaling for the moment, has the following ideal dependence on $\\theta$:\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH}) \\propto \\sin(\\theta)$\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH_2}) \\propto \\sin(2\\theta)$\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH_3}) \\propto \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(\\theta) + \\sin(3\\theta))$\n\nFor an ideal DEPT-$90^\\circ$ experiment, $\\theta=90^\\circ$:\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH}) \\propto \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1$\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH_2}) \\propto \\sin(2\\times90^\\circ) = \\sin(180^\\circ) = 0$\n-   $I(\\mathrm{CH_3}) \\propto \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(90^\\circ) + \\sin(270^\\circ)) = \\frac{3}{4}(1 - 1) = 0$\n\nIdeally, only $\\mathrm{CH}$ signals appear. Since ethanol has no $\\mathrm{CH}$ group, the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ spectrum should be null. However, the data show a weak but non-zero signal for the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group at $\\delta=58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and no signal for the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group. This deviation from ideal behavior requires a physical explanation based on the provided parameters.\n\n-   **Flip-Angle Imperfection**: The problem states a possible systematic error of $\\pm 5^\\circ$ in $\\theta$. Let the actual angle be $\\theta = 90^\\circ + \\epsilon$.\n    -   For the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group, the intensity becomes $I(\\mathrm{CH_2}) \\propto \\sin(2(90^\\circ + \\epsilon)) = \\sin(180^\\circ + 2\\epsilon) = -\\sin(2\\epsilon)$. For small $\\epsilon$ (in radians), this is approximately $-2\\epsilon$. This is a first-order dependence on the error $\\epsilon$.\n    -   For the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group, the intensity becomes $I(\\mathrm{CH_3}) \\propto \\sin(90^\\circ + \\epsilon) + \\sin(3(90^\\circ + \\epsilon)) = \\cos(\\epsilon) + \\sin(270^\\circ + 3\\epsilon) = \\cos(\\epsilon) - \\cos(3\\epsilon)$. Using the Taylor series $\\cos(x) \\approx 1 - x^2/2$, this becomes approximately $(1-\\epsilon^2/2) - (1-9\\epsilon^2/2) = 4\\epsilon^2$. This is a second-order dependence on the error $\\epsilon$.\n    -   The analysis shows that a small error in the $90^\\circ$ pulse will cause a leakage signal for a $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group that is linearly proportional to the error, while the leakage for a $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group is proportional to the square of the error. Thus, $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ groups are much more sensitive to this imperfection than $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ groups. This is perfectly consistent with observing a weak signal for $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ but none for $\\mathrm{CH_3}$. Quantitatively, the ratio of the observed $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ signal in DEPT-$90^\\circ$ ($0.08$) to DEPT-$45^\\circ$ ($0.55$) is $0.08/0.55 \\approx 0.145$. For DEPT-45, the $\\theta$-dependence is $\\sin(2\\times45^\\circ) = 1$. The leakage is $\\sin(2\\epsilon)$. Setting $|\\sin(2\\epsilon)| \\approx 0.145$ gives $2|\\epsilon| \\approx 0.146$ rad, or $|\\epsilon| \\approx 0.073$ rad, which is $\\approx 4.2^\\circ$. This value is well within the stated experimental error of $\\pm 5^\\circ$.\n\n-   **J-Coupling Mismatch**: The evolution delay is $\\tau = 1/(2J_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = 1/(2 \\times 135) \\approx 3.7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The actual couplings are $J_{\\mathrm{CH_3}}=125\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $J_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=140\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This mismatch means that the creation of antiphase magnetization is not perfectly efficient. The efficiency is modulated by a factor dependent on $\\sin(\\pi J \\cdot 2\\tau) = \\sin(\\pi J/J_{\\mathrm{ref}})$. This factor scales the overall intensity of the DEPT signal but, in the first-order approximation, does not break the nulling condition at $\\theta=90^\\circ$. However, in a complete description of the spin dynamics, especially in concert with other imperfections like pulse errors, a $J$-mismatch can contribute to imperfect cancellation of magnetization pathways. It is a real experimental factor that influences signal intensities and can compound other errors.\n\n-   **Transverse Relaxation ($T_2$)**: The total time for the DEPT polarization transfer is on the order of $2\\tau$ or more, during which transverse magnetization decays with a time constant $T_2$. Since $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_2}) = 80\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is shorter than $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_3})=120\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, the signal from the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group will be more attenuated than the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ signal. This contributes to the observed relative intensities but is not the primary cause of the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ leakage.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$. The weak DEPT-$90^\\circ$ methylene signal arises from incomplete cancellation for an even number of attached protons when $^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ deviates from $J_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, compounded by flip-angle imperfection within $\\pm 5^\\circ$ and additional attenuation from the shorter $T_2(\\mathrm{CH_2})$ during the evolution periods. The DEPT-$135^\\circ$ phase pattern (upright $\\mathrm{CH_3}$, inverted $\\mathrm{CH_2}$) and the APT phase pattern (upright odd, inverted even) are consistent with these assignments.**\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.** This option correctly assigns the carbons. Its explanation for the DEPT-$90^\\circ$ leakage correctly identifies flip-angle imperfection as a key cause and notes that it is compounded by other real physical effects ($J$-mismatch and $T_2$ relaxation). The relative contributions are described plausibly. The confirmation from DEPT-135 and APT is also correct. This is the most complete and physically justified explanation. While the statement that $J$-mismatch itself causes incomplete cancellation is a simplification of a more complex effect, its inclusion as a compounding factor alongside the primary cause (flip-angle error) is reasonable in a practical context.\n\n-   **B. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$. The unusual DEPT-$90^\\circ$ signal at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is due to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect amplifying the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ response.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** The assignment of signals is incorrect, contradicting chemical shift principles, APT, and DEPT-135 data. The explanation is also physically unsound. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is a relaxation-based phenomenon affecting signal intensity, it does not create signals where a null is predicted by the coherent evolution of the DEPT sequence.\n\n-   **C. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$. The weak DEPT-$90^\\circ$ signal is entirely explained by $T_1$ differences alone; $^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ mismatch and flip-angle errors do not contribute appreciably to DEPT selection or residuals.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** The assignment is correct, but the explanation is flawed. $T_1$ relaxation governs the recovery of magnetization between scans and does not influence the coherent spin evolution within a single DEPT sequence, which is what determines the multiplicity selection. Stating that flip-angle errors do not contribute is fundamentally wrong, as this is the primary cause of such leakage.\n\n-   **D. $\\delta = 18.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is $\\mathrm{CH_2}$. The residual DEPT-$90^\\circ$ methylene signal must be attributed exclusively to phase-cycling errors; under ideal DEPT, the scalar coupling dependence eliminates any possibility of $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ leakage regardless of $^{1}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ dispersion or relaxation.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** While imperfect phase cycling can cause artifacts, attributing the signal *exclusively* to this is an overstatement that incorrectly dismisses other major causes. The claim that no leakage is possible under ideal DEPT regardless of other factors is false, as a miscalibration of the $\\theta$ pulse (a deviation from the ideal value of $90^\\circ$) is a classic and well-understood cause of leakage.\n\n-   **E. The APT phase report must be incorrect because ethanol contains a quaternary carbon near $\\delta \\approx 58\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$; therefore the inverted DEPT-$135^\\circ$ peak at $\\delta = 58.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ corresponds to a quaternary site, not $\\mathrm{CH_2}$.**\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.** This statement contains multiple factual errors. Ethanol has no quaternary carbon. An inverted DEPT-$135^\\circ$ signal is the characteristic signature of a $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group. Quaternary carbons are not observed in DEPT spectra at all because the experiment relies on polarization transfer from attached protons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3718615"}]}
