It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a conclusive answer. The problem asks for the minimal spectral workflow, defined as the smallest set of complementary techniques, to distinguish the three constitutional isomers of $C_3H_8O$: $1$-propanol, $2$-propanol, and methoxyethane.\n\n**First-Principles Analysis**\n\nThe molecular formula is $C_3H_8O$. The index of hydrogen deficiency ($IHD$) is calculated as:\n$$IHD = C + 1 - \\frac{H}{2} - \\frac{X}{2} + \\frac{N}{2} = 3 + 1 - \\frac{8}{2} = 0$$\nAn $IHD$ of $0$ indicates a saturated acyclic molecule, which is consistent with all three candidate structures. This calculation confirms the structures are plausible but does not distinguish among them.\n\nThe three candidates are:\n1.  **$1$-propanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2OH}$)**: A primary alcohol.\n2.  **$2$-propanol ($\\mathrm{(CH_3)_2CHOH}$)**: A secondary alcohol.\n3.  **Methoxyethane ($\\mathrm{CH_3OCH_2CH_3}$)**: An ether.\n\nThe core task is to distinguish between two alcohols and an ether, and then to distinguish between the primary and secondary alcohol isomers.\n\n**Analysis of Spectroscopic Techniques**\n\n1.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**:\n    IR spectroscopy is exceptionally effective at identifying functional groups.\n    *   **Alcohols** ($1$-propanol and $2$-propanol) will exhibit a characteristic strong and broad absorption band for the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch, typically in the range of $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3200-3600\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Ethers** (methoxyethane) lack an $\\mathrm{O-H}$ bond and will therefore show a conspicuous absence of this band. They do show a $\\mathrm{C-O-C}$ stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n    Thus, IR spectroscopy can, in a single experiment, conclusively identify methoxyethane by the absence of the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch. However, while there are subtle differences in the $\\mathrm{C-O}$ stretching frequencies between primary ($\\approx 1050\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) and secondary ($\\approx 1100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) alcohols, distinguishing between $1$-propanol and $2$-propanol by IR alone is not considered robust or conclusive under routine conditions. Therefore, IR is a necessary but insufficient technique for the complete task.\n\n2.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR) Spectroscopy**:\n    ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectroscopy provides detailed information about the connectivity of the carbon-hydrogen framework via chemical shift ($\\delta$), integration (relative number of protons), and spin-spin coupling (multiplicity).\n\n    *   **$1$-Propanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2OH}$)**: Exhibits a propyl group pattern.\n        *   A triplet ($\\delta \\approx 0.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $3\\mathrm{H}$) for the terminal $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group coupled to the adjacent $\\mathrm{CH_2}$.\n        *   A triplet ($\\delta \\approx 3.6\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $2\\mathrm{H}$) for the $\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ group coupled to the adjacent $\\mathrm{CH_2}$.\n        *   A complex multiplet (a sextet, $\\delta \\approx 1.6\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $2\\mathrm{H}$) for the central $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ group coupled to both the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ groups.\n        *   A variable, often broad, singlet for the $\\mathrm{OH}$ proton ($1\\mathrm{H}$).\n\n    *   **$2$-Propanol ($\\mathrm{(CH_3)_2CHOH}$)**: Exhibits a characteristic isopropyl group pattern.\n        *   A doublet ($\\delta \\approx 1.2\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $6\\mathrm{H}$) for the two equivalent $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ groups, coupled to the single methine proton.\n        *   A septet ($\\delta \\approx 4.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $1\\mathrm{H}$) for the $\\mathrm{CHOH}$ methine proton, coupled to the six equivalent methyl protons.\n        *   A variable singlet for the $\\mathrm{OH}$ proton ($1\\mathrm{H}$).\n\n    *   **Methoxyethane ($\\mathrm{CH_3OCH_2CH_3}$)**: Exhibits an ethyl group pattern and a methoxy singlet.\n        *   A singlet ($\\delta \\approx 3.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $3\\mathrm{H}$) for the $\\mathrm{OCH_3}$ group (no adjacent protons for coupling).\n        *   A quartet ($\\delta \\approx 3.4\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $2\\mathrm{H}$) for the $\\mathrm{OCH_2}$ group coupled to the adjacent $\\mathrm{CH_3}$.\n        *   A triplet ($\\delta \\approx 1.2\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $3\\mathrm{H}$) for the terminal $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group coupled to the adjacent $\\mathrm{OCH_2}$.\n\n    The ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum for each of the three isomers is uniquely diagnostic. Therefore, ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR alone can, in principle, distinguish all three isomers.\n\n**Evaluation of Minimal Workflow**\n\nThe problem defines the minimal workflow as \"the smallest set of complementary techniques that, collectively, remove all structural ambiguity\". While ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR alone (a set of one technique) is sufficient, the combination of IR and ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR (a set of two techniques) represents a classic, robust, and pedagogically standard workflow. IR provides unambiguous functional group identification, and ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR provides unambiguous skeletal connectivity. They are perfectly complementary. The workflow presented in Option A, which utilizes this combination, is highly conclusive and practical.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. IR followed by one-dimensional proton NMR (${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR).**\nThis option proposes a workflow where IR is used first to separate the ether from the two alcohols. Then, ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR is used to distinguish the primary alcohol ($1$-propanol) from the secondary alcohol ($2$-propanol). The description of the expected spectral data for all three isomers is entirely correct.\n*   The use of IR to identify the $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3200-3600\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is the standard method for identifying alcohols. Its absence conclusively proves the compound is the ether, methoxyethane.\n*   The predicted ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR patterns for $1$-propanol (propyl system: triplet, multiplet, triplet) and $2$-propanol (isopropyl system: $6\\mathrm{H}$ doublet, $1\\mathrm{H}$ septet) are textbook examples and are completely diagnostic.\n*   The description for methoxyethane (methoxy singlet and ethyl pattern) is also correct.\nThis workflow is robust, conclusive, and aligns with the definition of using complementary techniques. All specific details provided are scientifically sound.\n*Verdict: Correct.*\n\n**B. EI-MS only.**\nThis option proposes using Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry alone. It claims that $1$-propanol gives a dominant peak at $m/z=31$ ($[\\mathrm{CH_2OH}]^+$) and $2$-propanol gives a base peak at $m/z=45$ ($[\\mathrm{CH_3CHOH}]^+$). This part is generally correct. However, it claims that methoxyethane can be assigned by the *absence* of $m/z=31$. This is factually incorrect. Methoxyethane ($\\mathrm{CH_3OCH_2CH_3}$) can undergo alpha-cleavage by losing an ethyl radical to form the $[\\mathrm{CH_3O}]^+$ fragment, which has an $m/z$ of $31$. Therefore, EI-MS cannot reliably distinguish $1$-propanol from methoxyethane on this basis. The workflow is not conclusive.\n*Verdict: Incorrect.*\n\n**C. Carbon-13 NMR (${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR) with DEPT-135 only.**\nThis option proposes a workflow using ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR with DEPT-135. This combination of techniques is indeed powerful enough to distinguish the three isomers: $2$-propanol is unique in having only $2$ carbon signals; $1$-propanol and methoxyethane both have $3$ signals but can be distinguished by their DEPT-135 spectra ($1$-propanol: one positive $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ signal, two negative $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ signals; methoxyethane: two positive $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ signals, one negative $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ signal). However, the justification text contains a critical scientific error: \"...infer functional class by the presence or absence of an $\\mathrm{O{-}H}$ signature in ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$...\". Carbon-13 NMR detects carbon nuclei; it does not directly detect protons on oxygen atoms. One infers an alcohol functional group from the chemical shift of the carbon atom bearing the $\\mathrm{OH}$ group, not from a direct \"$\\mathrm{O-H}$ signature\". This flawed explanation invalidates the option as a correct answer.\n*Verdict: Incorrect.*\n\n**D. IR, ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR, and two-dimensional HSQC and HMBC.**\nThis option proposes a large suite of experiments including 2D NMR techniques. While this workflow would certainly be conclusive, it is far from minimal. The 1D techniques described in option A are sufficient to solve the problem completely. The claim that \"only a full suite including HSQC/HMBC can be considered conclusive\" is false for this simple case. This workflow violates the \"minimal\" requirement.\n*Verdict: Incorrect.*\n\n**E. IR alone.**\nThis option proposes using only IR spectroscopy. As discussed, IR can conclusively identify methoxyethane by the absence of an $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch. However, its ability to distinguish between $1$-propanol and $2$-propanol is not reliable under routine conditions. The shape and position of the broad $\\mathrm{O-H}$ stretch are highly dependent on experimental conditions (concentration, temperature, solvent) and are not robust diagnostic criteria. Therefore, this workflow is not conclusive for all three candidates.\n*Verdict: Incorrect.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides a scientifically sound, conclusive, and robust workflow. The combination of IR and ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR is a classic example of using complementary techniques to achieve an unambiguous structural assignment. Every piece of spectral data described in option A is correct and diagnostic.

In a realistic scenario, a sample of \"acetone\" exists in a dynamic equilibrium with a minuscule amount of its enol tautomer, prop-2-enol. A hypothetical sample of \"prop-2-enol\" would rapidly tautomerize to acetone, which is the thermodynamically stable form. The challenge is to find a set of observables that can distinguish propanal from the acetone/prop-2-enol system, and also distinguish the hypothetical pure enol based on its unique structural features (e.g., lack of a carbonyl, presence of a hydroxyl and a double bond). The problem is structured to test this understanding.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to devise a minimal and robust method to distinguish between the three isomers: acetone, propanal, and prop-2-enol. We must first predict the key spectral features for each.\n\n**1. Predicted Spectral Features**\n\n-   **Acetone (Propanone, $CH_3C(=O)CH_3$)**:\n    -   **FT-IR:** Strong $C=O$ stretch near $1715\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. $sp^3$ $C-H$ stretches below $3000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. No $O-H$ or aldehydic $C-H$ signals.\n    -   **$^1$H NMR:** One signal due to $C_2$ symmetry: a singlet at $\\delta \\approx 2.1 \\text{ ppm}$ integrating to $6H$.\n    -   **$^{13}$C NMR:** Two signals: a carbonyl carbon at $\\delta \\approx 205 \\text{ ppm}$ and a methyl carbon at $\\delta \\approx 30 \\text{ ppm}$.\n    -   **EI-MS:** Molecular ion $M^{+\\bullet}$ at $m/z = 58$. Base peak is typically at $m/z = 43$, corresponding to the acetyl cation $[\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{CO}]^+$.\n\n-   **Propanal ($CH_3CH_2CHO$)**:\n    -   **FT-IR:** Strong $C=O$ stretch near $1725\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Two characteristic aldehydic $C-H$ stretches near $2820\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $2720\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. No $O-H$ signal.\n    -   **$^1$H NMR:** Three signals. An aldehydic proton ($1H$) as a triplet at $\\delta \\approx 9.7-9.8 \\text{ ppm}$. A methylene group ($2H$) as a multiplet (quartet of triplets) at $\\delta \\approx 2.4 \\text{ ppm}$. A methyl group ($3H$) as a triplet at $\\delta \\approx 1.1 \\text{ ppm}$. The chemical shift of the aldehydic proton is highly diagnostic.\n    -   **$^{13}$C NMR:** Three signals: a carbonyl carbon at $\\delta \\approx 200 \\text{ ppm}$, a methylene carbon at $\\delta \\approx 35-45 \\text{ ppm}$, and a methyl carbon at $\\delta \\approx 5-15 \\text{ ppm}$.\n    -   **EI-MS:** Molecular ion $M^{+\\bullet}$ at $m/z = 58$. Characteristic fragments include $m/z = 57$ ($[M-\\mathrm{H}]^+$), and $m/z = 29$ ($[\\mathrm{CHO}]^+$), which is often the base peak.\n\n-   **Prop-2-enol ($CH_2=C(OH)CH_3$)**:\n    -   **FT-IR:** No $C=O$ stretch. Instead, a broad $O-H$ stretch around $3200-3600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and a $C=C$ stretch around $1650\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n    -   **$^1$H NMR:** Distinct signals for vinylic protons ($=CH_2$) around $\\delta \\approx 4.0-4.5 \\text{ ppm}$, a methyl group ($CH_3$) at $\\delta \\approx 1.8 \\text{ ppm}$, and a hydroxyl proton ($OH$) with a variable chemical shift, which would appear as a broad singlet due to exchange. The presence of vinylic protons and an exchangeable proton, and the absence of an aldehydic proton, are key.\n    -   **$^{13}$C NMR:** No carbonyl signal. Instead, two vinylic carbon signals ($\\delta \\approx 150 \\text{ ppm}$ for $C-OH$ and $\\delta \\approx 90 \\text{ ppm}$ for $=CH_2$) and a methyl signal.\n    -   **EI-MS:** Molecular ion $M^{+\\bullet}$ at $m/z = 58$. Upon ionization, the enol radical cation can readily tautomerize to the more stable keto (acetone) radical cation. Consequently, its fragmentation pattern is expected to be very similar, if not identical, to that of acetone, making EI-MS an unreliable technique for distinguishing these two tautomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Options**\n\nThe question asks for the \"smallest set of observables\" that is \"sufficient\" and \"minimal\" to distinguish the three isomers reliably.\n\n-   **A. A single $^1$H NMR spectrum (chemical shifts, integrals, and multiplicities) suffices in all practical cases; no other data are needed.**\n    The predicted $^1$H NMR spectra are indeed unique for all three isomers. Propanal is uniquely identified by the aldehydic proton signal at $\\delta \\approx 9.8 \\text{ ppm}$. Acetone is uniquely identified by a single singlet at $\\delta \\approx 2.1 \\text{ ppm}$. Prop-2-enol is uniquely identified by its vinylic proton signals. Tautomerization effects on coupling would not obscure these primary chemical shift differences. So, a full $^1$H NMR spectrum is sufficient. However, the option refers to the entire spectrum, which is a rich dataset. A \"minimal set of observables\" would likely be a small subset of the information from this spectrum. Thus, while true that the experiment is sufficient, the option may not be describing the *minimal set of observables*.\n\n-   **B. A single FT-IR spectrum focused on the carbonyl stretching region $1850-1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and the aldehydic C–H stretching region $2830-2690\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ suffices; no other data are needed.**\n    This proposes a minimal set of two observables from a single experiment. Let's test it:\n    1.  Signal in $C=O$ region ($1710-1740\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$)?\n    2.  Signal in aldehydic $C-H$ region ($2700-2850\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$)?\n    -   **Acetone:** (1) Yes, (2) No.\n    -   **Propanal:** (1) Yes, (2) Yes.\n    -   **Prop-2-enol:** (1) No, (2) No.\n    This set of two observables produces a unique outcome for each isomer. It is sufficient. It is also minimal in the logical sense, as neither observation alone can distinguish all three isomers. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n-   **C. High-resolution EI-MS alone suffices by recognizing distinct base peaks and neutral losses; no other data are needed.**\n    As discussed, the radical cation of prop-2-enol is expected to tautomerize to that of acetone in the mass spectrometer. This leads to very similar, if not identical, fragmentation patterns. Therefore, EI-MS is not reliable for distinguishing acetone from its enol tautomer. High resolution would only confirm the elemental composition, not resolve this ambiguity. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. The two-observable set consisting of: (i) presence versus absence of a strong FT-IR carbonyl stretch near $1710–1740\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, and (ii) presence versus absence of a $^1$H NMR aldehydic proton at $\\delta \\approx 9$–$10$ ppm, is sufficient and minimal under the stated conditions.**\n    This proposes a minimal set of two observables from two different experiments. Let's test it:\n    1.  Presence of FT-IR $C=O$ stretch?\n    2.  Presence of $^1$H NMR aldehydic proton?\n    -   **Acetone:** (1) Yes, (2) No.\n    -   **Propanal:** (1) Yes, (2) Yes.\n    -   **Prop-2-enol:** (1) No, (2) No.\n    Like option B, this two-observable set provides a unique signature for each isomer. It is sufficient and logically minimal (neither observable alone is sufficient). The observables themselves—a strong carbonyl IR band and an aldehydic proton NMR signal in an otherwise empty region of the spectrum—are exceptionally robust and unambiguous. This is also a very strong candidate.\n\n-   **E. $^{13}$C NMR with broadband decoupling plus DEPT-$135$ (Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer, $135^\\circ$) alone is sufficient and minimal under the stated conditions.**\n    This experimental data set is indeed sufficient. Acetone gives $2$ peaks (one positive in DEPT). Propanal gives $3$ peaks (one negative in DEPT). Prop-2-enol gives $3$ peaks (no negative peaks in DEPT). These are unique signatures. Similar to option A, this identifies a sufficient *experiment*, not necessarily the *minimal set of observables*. Furthermore, $^{13}$C NMR is less sensitive and typically requires more time and/or sample than FT-IR or $^1$H NMR, making it less \"minimal\" from a practical standpoint.\n\n**3. Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nWe are left comparing options B and D, both of which describe a sufficient and logically minimal set of two observables. The choice between them hinges on the reliability of the observables and the precise interpretation of the question.\n\n-   **Set B:** {IR $C=O$?, IR aldehydic $C-H$?}\n-   **Set D:** {IR $C=O$?, $^1$H NMR aldehydic $H$?}\n\nBoth sets use the presence/absence of a carbonyl stretch as the first decision point, which reliably separates the enol from the two carbonyl compounds. The second decision point distinguishes the aldehyde from the ketone.\n-   In set B, this is done by looking for the aldehydic $C-H$ stretches in the IR spectrum. These signals are diagnostic but are of medium-to-weak intensity and fall in a region that can have other $C-H$ absorbances, sometimes making them less than perfectly clear.\n-   In set D, this is done by looking for the aldehydic proton in the $^1$H NMR spectrum. This signal appears at a unique chemical shift ($\\delta \\approx 9-10 \\text{ ppm}$) where virtually no other signals occur. Its presence is an exceptionally reliable and unambiguous indicator of an aldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the set of observables in D is more robust and less prone to ambiguity than the set in B. The question asks for a set that \"remains reliable despite reasonable complications\". The superior clarity of the $^1$H NMR aldehydic proton signal makes the set in D more reliable. While it requires using two instruments, the question is about the information content of the *observables* themselves. Option D correctly identifies a set of two simple, binary observables that are sufficient, logically minimal, and founded on the most salient and reliable spectral features to solve this specific classification problem. This structured, flowchart-like approach is precisely what is meant by a minimal, sufficient set of identifying criteria.\n\n**Final Verdict on Options:**\n-   **A:** Incorrect. The full spectrum is more than the 'minimal set of observables'.\n-   **B:** Incorrect. While it describes a minimal sufficient set, the observables are less robust than those in option D.\n-   **C:** Incorrect. Fundamentally flawed due to tautomerization in the mass spectrometer.\n-   **D:** Correct. It identifies a logically minimal, sufficient set of two highly reliable and unambiguous observables that perfectly map to a decision tree for identifying the isomers.\n-   **E:** Incorrect. The full experiment is more information than a minimal set, and it is a less practically minimal technique.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "3699601"}, {"introduction": "Expert-level analysis requires an understanding of the physical principles that govern spectral appearance, especially when dynamic processes are at play. While the previous exercises relied on static coupling patterns, this problem delves into the quantitative world of chemical exchange kinetics, a process that frequently obscures vital coupling information for labile protons like those in alcohols ($OH$) [@problem_id:3699629].

There may be more than one correct option.", "solution": "The central task is to identify experimental strategies that slow down the proton exchange rate, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, sufficiently to resolve scalar coupling, $J_{\\mathrm{HO-CH}}$. The condition for observing this coupling is that the exchange rate must be substantially slower than the coupling frequency, expressed as $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\ll J$. The total exchange rate is the sum of an intrinsic unimolecular term, $k_0$, and a water-catalyzed term, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_0 + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$$\nThe intrinsic rate follows the Arrhenius equation, $k_0(T) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)$, while the catalytic rate is given by $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = k_2[\\mathrm{H_2O}]$.

This has two consequences, both of which prevent observation of the desired coupling:\n1. The chemical exchange pathway is enhanced, increasing $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ rather than decreasing it.\n2. The proton is replaced by a deuteron. The gyromagnetic ratio of deuterium ($\\gamma_D$) is about $6.5$ times smaller than that of the proton ($\\gamma_H$). The coupling constant scales with the gyromagnetic ratios, so $J_{\\mathrm{DO-CH}} = J_{\\mathrm{HO-CH}} \\times (\\gamma_D / \\gamma_H) \\approx (5\\ \\mathrm{Hz}) / 6.5 \\approx 0.77\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. Such a small coupling would be difficult to resolve even if exchange were slow.\nThis strategy is counterproductive.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Presaturate the water resonance at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ in $\\mathrm{CD}_3\\mathrm{OD}$ to suppress water signal intensity, keeping other parameters unchanged.**\n\nPresaturation is an NMR pulse sequence technique that uses radiofrequency irradiation to equalize the spin state populations of a target nucleus (here, water protons), nullifying its net magnetization and hence its signal. While this technique affects the observed NMR spectrum, it does *not* alter the underlying chemical kinetics of proton exchange.
