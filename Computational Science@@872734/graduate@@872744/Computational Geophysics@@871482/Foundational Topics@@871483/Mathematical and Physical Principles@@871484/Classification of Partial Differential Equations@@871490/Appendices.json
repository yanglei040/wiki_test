The classification criteria are as follows:\n- The PDE is **elliptic** at $(x,y)$ if $B^2 - AC  0$. Elliptic equations are typically associated with steady-state phenomena and diffusive smoothing, such as the Laplace equation.\n- The PDE is **parabolic** at $(x,y)$ if $B^2 - AC = 0$. Parabolic equations are characteristic of time-dependent diffusive processes, such as the heat equation.\n- The PDE is **hyperbolic** at $(x,y)$ if $B^2 - AC  0$. Hyperbolic equations model wave-like propagation, such as the wave equation.\n\nThe specific PDE provided in the problem is:\n$$u_{xx} + x\\,u_{yy} = 0$$\nThis equation involves a variable coefficient, $x$, which means its type is not uniform across the entire $(x,y)$-plane.

With this substitution, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$ is replaced by $(i\\xi_i)(i\\xi_j) = -\\xi_i\\xi_j$. The principal symbol is thus given by\n$$\np(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} a_{ij}(x) (-\\xi_i\\xi_j) = -\\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} a_{ij}(x) \\xi_i\\xi_j\n$$\nNote: Some conventions define the symbol by substituting $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k}$ with $\\xi_k$, leading to a different sign. The classification of the PDE (e.g., ellipticity) depends on the properties of this quadratic form in $\\xi$, and the core analysis is insensitive to the sign convention.

Condition for Uniform Ellipticity**\n\nThe operator $L$ is defined as elliptic at a point $x$ if its principal symbol $p(x, \\xi)$ is non-zero for all non-zero vectors $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Since $A(x)$ is a symmetric matrix, $p(x, \\xi)$ is a real-valued quadratic form.
