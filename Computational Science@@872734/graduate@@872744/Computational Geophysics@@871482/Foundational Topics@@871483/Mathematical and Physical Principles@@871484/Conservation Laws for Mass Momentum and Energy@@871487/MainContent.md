## Introduction
The behavior of every dynamic system in [geophysics](@entry_id:147342), from the slow churn of the Earth's mantle to the rapid flow of its atmosphere and oceans, is governed by a concise yet powerful set of physical principles: the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy. These laws are the bedrock upon which the entire field of [computational geophysics](@entry_id:747618) is built, providing the mathematical language to describe and predict the evolution of complex Earth systems. However, translating these abstract principles into predictive, solvable models for phenomena as diverse as volcanic eruptions, tectonic plate motion, and climate change presents a significant challenge. This article bridges that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of these foundational laws.

The following chapters will guide you through this essential topic. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will derive the conservation laws from first principles, establishing the fundamental partial differential equations and introducing critical concepts like stress, dissipation, and [hydrostatic balance](@entry_id:263368). Next, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will demonstrate the remarkable versatility of these laws by exploring how they are used to model processes across the solid Earth, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and even in planetary science. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** points to practical exercises for implementing and verifying these principles in numerical code, solidifying the connection between theory and computation.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The behavior of geophysical continua—from the convecting mantle and planetary cores to oceans and atmospheres—is governed by a small set of fundamental conservation laws. These laws, expressing the [conservation of mass](@entry_id:268004), momentum, and energy, form the bedrock upon which all models in [computational geophysics](@entry_id:747618) are built. This chapter elucidates these foundational principles, starting from their most general form and progressing to the specific applications and insightful approximations used to model the Earth and other planetary bodies.

### The General Conservation Law: From Integral Balance to Pointwise Dynamics

The most fundamental statement of a conservation law is an integral balance over a finite region of space. Consider an arbitrary, fixed control volume $V$ within a continuum, with boundary $\partial V$. Let $\rho(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ be the mass density and $b(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ be a specific property of the fluid (i.e., per unit mass). The total amount of this property in the volume is $\int_V \rho b \, dV$. A conservation principle states that the time rate of change of this total amount is equal to the rate at which the property is generated by internal sources, $s(\boldsymbol{x},t)$, minus the net rate at which it flows out across the boundary. This outflow is described by a [flux vector](@entry_id:273577) $\boldsymbol{J}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$. The integral balance is therefore expressed as:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_V \rho b \, dV = \int_V s \, dV - \oint_{\partial V} \boldsymbol{J} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} \, dS
$$

where $\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward-pointing [unit normal vector](@entry_id:178851) on the surface $\partial V$.

While this integral form is the fundamental statement, computational methods typically require a local, pointwise [partial differential equation](@entry_id:141332) (PDE). To move from the integral to the [differential form](@entry_id:174025), two key mathematical steps are required. First, assuming sufficient regularity of the integrand, the time derivative can be moved inside the integral using the Leibniz integral rule, since the volume $V$ is fixed in time. Second, the [surface integral](@entry_id:275394) of the flux is converted into a [volume integral](@entry_id:265381) using the **Divergence Theorem** (also known as Gauss's theorem):

$$
\oint_{\partial V} \boldsymbol{J} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} \, dS = \int_V \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J} \, dV
$$

Applying these transformations, the integral balance becomes:

$$
\int_V \frac{\partial (\rho b)}{\partial t} \, dV = \int_V s \, dV - \int_V \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J} \, dV
$$

Combining the terms under a single integral gives:

$$
\int_V \left( \frac{\partial (\rho b)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J} - s \right) dV = 0
$$

Since this equation must hold for *any* arbitrary control volume $V$, the integrand itself must be zero everywhere. This is a consequence of the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations. The result is the general conservation law in its [differential form](@entry_id:174025):

$$
\frac{\partial (\rho b)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J} = s
$$

It is critical to recognize that these steps are only valid under certain mathematical conditions. In classical physics, one assumes all fields are continuously differentiable. However, many geophysical phenomena involve discontinuities, such as [shock waves](@entry_id:142404) in the atmosphere or faults in the solid Earth. Modern [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125) therefore relies on a weaker set of conditions. The Divergence Theorem, for instance, holds for [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) with square-integrable derivatives over domains with boundaries that are "Lipschitz continuous" (i.e., not infinitely wrinkled). The derivation of the pointwise law requires that the involved quantities are at least integrable functions, often residing in specific [function spaces](@entry_id:143478) like $L^1$ or Sobolev spaces such as $H(\text{div})$ [@problem_id:3580998]. This rigorous framework ensures that the conservation laws remain valid even in the presence of the sharp gradients and non-smooth features endemic to [geophysics](@entry_id:147342).

### Conservation of Mass: The Continuity Equation

The most direct application of the general conservation law is for mass itself. In this case, the specific property is simply unity ($b=1$), and mass is not created or destroyed internally, so the source term is zero ($s=0$). The conserved quantity is density $\rho$, and its flux is the mass flux, $\boldsymbol{J} = \rho \boldsymbol{u}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}$ is the [velocity field](@entry_id:271461). Substituting these into the general differential form yields the **[continuity equation](@entry_id:145242)**:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \boldsymbol{u}) = 0
$$

This equation can be expanded using the [product rule](@entry_id:144424) to reveal an alternative form involving the **material derivative**, $D/Dt \equiv \partial/\partial t + \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla$, which represents the rate of change following a fluid parcel:

$$
\frac{D\rho}{Dt} + \rho (\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}) = 0
$$

Here, the term $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}$ has a clear physical meaning: it is the **[volumetric strain rate](@entry_id:272471)**, or the fractional rate of change of the volume of an infinitesimal fluid parcel. The equation states that the density of a parcel decreases if its volume expands ($\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} > 0$) and vice-versa.

In many geophysical applications, density variations are small, leading to the common **incompressibility approximation**, $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0$. However, this is a strong assumption whose validity must be carefully assessed. For a compressible material, the change in density is related to the change in pressure. For an [isothermal process](@entry_id:143096), this relationship is defined by the isothermal bulk modulus, $K = \rho (\partial p / \partial \rho)_T$. From the [continuity equation](@entry_id:145242), the true [volumetric strain rate](@entry_id:272471) is $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = -(1/\rho) D\rho/Dt$. Using the definition of $K$, this can be written as [@problem_id:3580951]:

$$
\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = -\frac{1}{K} \frac{Dp}{Dt}
$$

This relation quantifies the error incurred by enforcing $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0$ in a compressible model. In regions with large material pressure changes, such as a lithospheric plate being subducted or experiencing strong tectonic pressure gradients, the term $Dp/Dt = \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla p$ can be significant. Neglecting it introduces a source or sink of mass into the model, violating a fundamental principle [@problem_id:3580951]. Other advanced approximations, such as the anelastic and Boussinesq models used in [atmospheric science](@entry_id:171854) and [mantle convection](@entry_id:203493) [@problem_id:3581003] [@problem_id:3580995], or the rigid-lid approximation in [oceanography](@entry_id:149256) [@problem_id:3580988], also modify the [mass conservation](@entry_id:204015) equation to filter out specific physical phenomena like sound waves or [surface gravity](@entry_id:160565) waves, topics we will return to later.

### Conservation of Momentum: The Equation of Motion

The [conservation of linear momentum](@entry_id:165717) is the continuum mechanics expression of Newton's second law. The specific property conserved is the velocity, $\boldsymbol{u}$, so the quantity per unit volume is [momentum density](@entry_id:271360), $\rho \boldsymbol{u}$. The differential form is the **Cauchy [momentum equation](@entry_id:197225)**:

$$
\frac{\partial (\rho \boldsymbol{u})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \boldsymbol{u} \otimes \boldsymbol{u}) = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \rho \boldsymbol{b}
$$

Here, $\rho \boldsymbol{u} \otimes \boldsymbol{u}$ is the momentum flux due to advection, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, and $\boldsymbol{b}$ is the body force per unit mass (e.g., gravity). Using the continuity equation, this can be rewritten in terms of the [material derivative](@entry_id:266939) of velocity:

$$
\rho \frac{D\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \rho \boldsymbol{b}
$$

This equation states that the rate of change of momentum of a fluid parcel is equal to the sum of the net surface force per unit volume ($\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$) and the [body force](@entry_id:184443) per unit volume ($\rho \boldsymbol{b}$).

#### The Stress Tensor and Surface Traction

The concept of stress is central to [momentum conservation](@entry_id:149964). The **stress tensor**, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, is a [second-rank tensor](@entry_id:199780) that completely describes the state of internal forces that adjacent parts of a continuum exert on each other. Its divergence, $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$, represents the [net force](@entry_id:163825) from these internal stresses on an infinitesimal [volume element](@entry_id:267802).

The force exerted across a specific surface is known as **traction**, $\boldsymbol{t}$, defined as force per unit area. The traction vector depends on both the location and the orientation of the surface, the latter given by its [unit normal vector](@entry_id:178851) $\boldsymbol{n}$. The fundamental relationship between traction and stress is given by **Cauchy's Stress Theorem**:

$$
\boldsymbol{t} = \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{n}
$$

This relationship can be derived by applying the integral momentum balance to an infinitesimal tetrahedron, where three faces are aligned with the coordinate planes and the fourth has an arbitrary normal $\boldsymbol{n}$. In the limit as the tetrahedron shrinks to a point, the inertial and [body force](@entry_id:184443) terms, which scale with volume, vanish faster than the surface force terms, which scale with area. The balance of [surface forces](@entry_id:188034) yields the linear relationship between $\boldsymbol{t}$ and $\boldsymbol{n}$ embodied by the stress tensor [@problem_id:3580985]. The columns of the stress tensor matrix are simply the traction vectors on surfaces with normals aligned with the coordinate axes.

#### Angular Momentum and the Symmetry of Stress

Conservation of angular momentum provides another crucial constraint. For a standard continuum without internal sources of torque (i.e., no "body couples" or "couple stresses"), the [conservation of angular momentum](@entry_id:153076) requires the Cauchy stress tensor to be symmetric:

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^T \quad \text{or} \quad \sigma_{ij} = \sigma_{ji}
$$

This symmetry reduces the number of independent components of the stress tensor in three dimensions from nine to six. However, in some advanced materials, such as viscoelastic media with internal microstructure, the stress tensor may not be symmetric. In such cases, angular momentum is balanced by the inclusion of **couple stresses**, which represent the transmission of torques through the material. The full angular momentum balance then includes contributions from these non-classical stress components [@problem_id:3581009]. For most large-scale geophysical fluids, the assumption of a symmetric stress tensor is highly accurate.

#### Application: Hydrostatic Equilibrium

A vital simplification of the momentum equation occurs when the fluid is static ($\boldsymbol{u}=\boldsymbol{0}$). In this case, the inertial term $\rho D\boldsymbol{u}/Dt$ vanishes, and the momentum equation reduces to a balance between stress gradients and body forces: $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \rho \boldsymbol{b} = 0$.

For a non-viscous fluid, the stress is purely isotropic (perpendicular to any surface) and compressive, described by the scalar pressure $p$: $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = -p\boldsymbol{I}$, where $\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity tensor. The [body force](@entry_id:184443) is gravity, $\boldsymbol{b} = \boldsymbol{g}$. The momentum balance then becomes the equation of **[hydrostatic equilibrium](@entry_id:146746)**:

$$
\nabla p = \rho \boldsymbol{g}
$$

This simple but profound equation governs the [pressure distribution](@entry_id:275409) in static fluids and forms the baseline state for planets, oceans, and atmospheres. For a constant gravitational acceleration $g$ in the $-z$ direction, it simplifies to $dp/dz = -\rho(z)g$ [@problem_id:3580993]. The pressure at any depth can be found by integrating the weight of the fluid column above it. For example, for a hypothetical atmosphere with a [density profile](@entry_id:194142) $\rho(z) = \rho_{0}\exp(-\sqrt{z/H})$, the pressure can be determined by integrating this relation from a reference point, demonstrating the direct link between the fundamental [momentum principle](@entry_id:261235) and the pressure structure of a planetary body [@problem_id:3580993]. Similarly, the total force on a submerged surface is found by integrating the hydrostatic pressure over its area [@problem_id:3580985].

### Conservation of Energy: Thermodynamics in Motion

The conservation of energy, which embodies the First Law of Thermodynamics, is arguably the most complex of the fundamental laws. The total energy of a fluid parcel consists of its internal energy $e$ and its kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}|\boldsymbol{u}|^2$.

#### The Mechanical Energy Equation and Viscous Dissipation

An equation for the evolution of kinetic energy can be derived directly from the momentum equation by taking its dot product with the velocity vector $\boldsymbol{u}$. This procedure yields the [mechanical energy](@entry_id:162989) equation, which describes the rate of change of kinetic energy density due to work done by forces [@problem_id:3580978]:

$$
\rho \frac{D}{Dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}|\boldsymbol{u}|^2\right) = \boldsymbol{u} \cdot (\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}) + \rho \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{b}
$$

The term $\boldsymbol{u} \cdot (\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma})$ can be rewritten as $\nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{\sigma}^T \cdot \boldsymbol{u}) - \boldsymbol{\sigma} : \nabla\boldsymbol{u}$. Assuming a symmetric stress tensor, this becomes $\nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}) - \boldsymbol{\sigma} : \boldsymbol{D}$, where $\boldsymbol{D} = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\boldsymbol{u} + (\nabla\boldsymbol{u})^T)$ is the **[rate-of-deformation tensor](@entry_id:184787)**. The term $\boldsymbol{\sigma} : \boldsymbol{D}$ is the **[stress power](@entry_id:182907)**, the rate at which stress does work to deform the material.

To understand the fate of this work, we decompose the stress tensor into its hydrostatic part (pressure) and its deviatoric part (viscous stress $\boldsymbol{\tau}$): $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = -p\boldsymbol{I} + \boldsymbol{\tau}$. The [stress power](@entry_id:182907) then splits into two components:

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma} : \boldsymbol{D} = -p(\boldsymbol{I}:\boldsymbol{D}) + \boldsymbol{\tau}:\boldsymbol{D} = -p(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u}) + \boldsymbol{\tau}:\boldsymbol{D}
$$

The first term, $-p(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u})$, represents the reversible work done by pressure during volume changes. The second term, $\Phi \equiv \boldsymbol{\tau}:\boldsymbol{D}$, is the **viscous dissipation rate**. This term represents the irreversible conversion of [mechanical energy](@entry_id:162989) into internal energy (heat) due to viscous friction within the fluid. For a Newtonian fluid with shear viscosity $\eta$ and [bulk viscosity](@entry_id:187773) $\zeta$, the dissipation function is $\Phi = 2\eta (\boldsymbol{D}':\boldsymbol{D}') + \zeta(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u})^2$, where $\boldsymbol{D}'$ is the deviatoric part of $\boldsymbol{D}$. Since $\eta \ge 0$, $\zeta \ge 0$, and the quadratic terms are non-negative, $\Phi \ge 0$, satisfying the Second Law of Thermodynamics [@problem_id:3580978]. Rigid-body rotation, for which $\boldsymbol{D}=\boldsymbol{0}$, causes no deformation and hence no dissipation. In contrast, a simple shear flow, $\boldsymbol{u} = (\gamma y, 0, 0)$, generates dissipation at a rate of $\eta \gamma^2$ entirely through [deviatoric stress](@entry_id:163323) [@problem_id:3580978].

#### The Full Energy Equation and Its Approximations

The complete [energy conservation](@entry_id:146975) law combines the [mechanical energy](@entry_id:162989) budget with the evolution of internal energy. A common form, written in terms of temperature $T$, is:

$$
\rho c_p \frac{DT}{Dt} = \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) + \Phi + \rho H + \alpha T \frac{Dp}{Dt}
$$

Here, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, $k$ is thermal conductivity, $H$ is the rate of internal heat generation (e.g., from [radioactive decay](@entry_id:142155)), $\alpha$ is the [coefficient of thermal expansion](@entry_id:143640), and the final term represents **compressional heating** (or [adiabatic heating](@entry_id:182901)), the change in temperature due to pressure changes experienced by a fluid parcel.

In many geophysical scenarios, not all terms in this equation are equally important. **Scaling analysis** is a powerful tool used to estimate the magnitude of each term and justify simplifications. For example, in models of slow [mantle convection](@entry_id:203493), one can compare the magnitude of compressional heating, $\alpha T Dp/Dt \sim \alpha T (\rho g U)$, with the advection of heat, $\rho c_p DT/Dt \sim \rho c_p (U \Delta T/L)$ [@problem_id:3580995]. The ratio of these terms defines a [dimensionless number](@entry_id:260863), $R \sim (\alpha g L / c_p) (T/\Delta T)$. For typical mantle parameters, this ratio is less than one, justifying the neglect of compressional heating. This leads to the widely used **Boussinesq approximation**, which simplifies the energy equation while retaining the crucial effect of thermal [buoyancy](@entry_id:138985) in the momentum equation [@problem_id:3580995].

### Derived Conservation Laws: The Case of Potential Vorticity

Beyond the three fundamental laws, certain combinations of these laws can yield powerful derived invariants. The most famous in [geophysical fluid dynamics](@entry_id:150356) is **[potential vorticity](@entry_id:276663) (PV)**. PV is not a new fundamental principle but rather a quantity that is materially conserved ($D/Dt = 0$) under specific conditions. For a rotating, stratified, inviscid, and adiabatic fluid, the **Ertel [potential vorticity](@entry_id:276663)** is defined as:

$$
q \equiv \frac{\boldsymbol{\omega}_a \cdot \nabla \theta}{\rho}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\omega}_a = \nabla \times \boldsymbol{u} + 2\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ is the [absolute vorticity](@entry_id:262794) (relative [vorticity](@entry_id:142747) plus [planetary vorticity](@entry_id:265327) from the [rotating frame](@entry_id:155637) $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$) and $\theta$ is a materially conserved quantity that is a function of entropy (like potential temperature). The conservation law, $Dq/Dt = 0$, can be derived by combining the curl of the momentum equation with the mass continuity equation and the adiabatic condition $D\theta/Dt = 0$ [@problem_id:3581004].

PV conservation acts as a potent dynamical constraint. It links the stretching of vortex lines (kinematics) to changes in stratification (thermodynamics). It explains why fluid columns spun up in a rotating tank become taller and thinner, and it is the cornerstone for understanding the behavior of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic eddies and jet streams. It is crucial to understand that PV conservation is a constraint on motion pathways, not an [energy principle](@entry_id:748989) itself. While total energy is conserved in an inviscid, adiabatic system, PV governs how this energy can be partitioned and exchanged between kinetic and potential forms [@problem_id:3581004].

### Approximations as Physical Filters

A recurring theme in the application of conservation laws to geophysics is the use of approximations. The incompressible, Boussinesq, anelastic [@problem_id:3581003], and rigid-lid [@problem_id:3580988] approximations all simplify the governing equations. These are not arbitrary mathematical conveniences but are carefully justified physical filters. They are designed to remove specific, often high-frequency, modes of motion (like [acoustic waves](@entry_id:174227) or surface gravity waves) that are irrelevant to the slower, larger-scale phenomena of interest (like convection or [geostrophic flow](@entry_id:166112)).

The validity of each approximation is established through rigorous [scaling analysis](@entry_id:153681) that compares the [characteristic time](@entry_id:173472) and length scales of different processes. For example, the anelastic approximation is valid when the flow's Mach number is small, ensuring that the energy in [acoustic modes](@entry_id:263916) is negligible [@problem_id:3581003]. The rigid-lid approximation is valid when the frequency of the motion is much lower than that of [surface gravity](@entry_id:160565) waves [@problem_id:3580988]. By systematically filtering the full conservation laws, we arrive at models that are both computationally tractable and physically faithful to the specific geophysical regime under investigation. This process of principled simplification is the art and science of [computational geophysics](@entry_id:747618).
