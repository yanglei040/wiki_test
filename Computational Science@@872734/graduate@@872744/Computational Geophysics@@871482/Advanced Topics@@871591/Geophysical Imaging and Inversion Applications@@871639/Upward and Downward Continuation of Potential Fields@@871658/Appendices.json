This is an unstable, high-pass filter that amplifies high-wavenumber components.\n\nThe FFT-based algorithm implements this process on a discrete grid, which implicitly assumes the data is periodic. The convolution theorem states that multiplication in the Fourier domain is equivalent to convolution in the spatial domain. For periodic data, this becomes a **circular convolution**. This is equivalent to convolving the original data patch with a periodized version of the spatial filter (the Poisson kernel):\n$$ u_{FFT}(x,y,z) = u(x,y,0) * \\left( \\sum_{m,n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(x-mL_x, y-nL_y, z) \\right) $$\nThe true solution would only involve the $m=0, n=0$ term. The bias, or \"wrap-around\" error, is the contribution from all other terms $(m,n) \\neq (0,0)$. This bias is largest near the boundaries of the domain, where the influence of the nearest periodic images is strongest.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The FFT-based continuation is equivalent, in the physical domain, to convolving $u$ with a lattice-summed Green’s function, i.e., the Poisson kernel periodically replicated on the $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ lattice of periods $L_x$ and $L_y$.

For upward continuation to height $h$, the bias magnitude scales like a Poisson-kernel tail $P(s,h) \\sim \\dfrac{h}{2\\pi (s^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}$, decaying rapidly as $s$ grows. A practical mitigation is to zero-pad in space to create a guard zone so that $s$ is large (e.g., several $h$), perform the continuation on the padded grid, and discard a border of width comparable to the guard zone.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It accurately describes the source of wrap-around error as a convolution with a periodized kernel. The scaling of the bias is correctly identified with the tail of the Poisson kernel. The proposed mitigation strategy—zero-padding in the spatial domain to increase the effective period and then discarding the biased border region—is the standard and correct method to combat this artifact.\n\n**B. In downward continuation, high spatial frequencies are suppressed, so periodic wrap-around is negligible. Therefore, padding is unnecessary; in fact, using a rectangular (boxcar) window at the original edges is optimal to preserve resolution.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Downward continuation *amplifies*, not suppresses, high spatial frequencies. This amplification makes artifacts from boundary discontinuities and wrap-around much more severe, not negligible. Padding is therefore even more critical for downward continuation than for upward continuation.\n\n**C. Applying a smooth apodization (for example, a cosine taper) that decays to near zero at the boundaries before the FFT reduces boundary discontinuities, thereby reducing spectral leakage and the influence of periodic images. After continuation, restricting attention to the untapered interior reduces edge bias. This is particularly important for downward continuation, where high wavenumbers are amplified.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Tapering the edges of the data before the FFT makes the periodic extension of the data continuous, which significantly reduces the artificial high-frequency power associated with boundary discontinuities. This is a crucial pre-processing step, especially for unstable operations like downward continuation that would otherwise catastrophically amplify these numerical artifacts.\n\n**D. Increasing the number of Fourier modes by zero-filling in the Fourier domain (interpolating in $k$) without enlarging the spatial extent increases the effective periodicity length and therefore removes wrap-around bias near the edges.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Zero-filling in the *Fourier domain* corresponds to interpolation in the *spatial domain*, creating a denser grid over the same area. It does not change the periodicity lengths $L_x$ and $L_y$ and therefore does not mitigate wrap-around bias. To mitigate wrap-around, one must pad with zeros in the *spatial domain*.\n\n**E. Mirror-padding (even extension) of the data at the boundaries eliminates spurious image interactions for harmonic fields because solutions of Laplace’s equation are even-symmetric, so periodic sums no longer bias the edges; hence it is a complete remedy without discarding borders.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While mirror-padding is a useful technique that can reduce boundary artifacts more effectively than zero-padding in some cases, its underlying assumptions are misstated. Solutions to Laplace's equation are not generally even-symmetric. Mirror-padding imposes an artificial Neumann boundary condition ($\\partial u / \\partial n = 0$) on the data, which may not be physically correct.

Inverse Step Analysis:**\nThis step maps the observed data at $z=0$ to an equivalent source layer at $z=-d$. This is an inverse problem. The forward model propagates the field from the layer at $z=-d$ to the observation plane at $z=0$. The vertical distance is $\\Delta z = 0 - (-d) = d$. This is an upward continuation, so the forward operator acts like a low-pass filter $\\mathrm{e}^{-kd}$. The inverse problem, therefore, involves an operator that acts like $\\mathrm{e}^{+kd}$, which amplifies high wavenumbers. This makes the inverse step inherently unstable (ill-posed), which is why Tikhonov regularization is necessary. The instability of this step increases as the layer depth $d$ increases, because the amplification factor $\\mathrm{e}^{kd}$ becomes larger.\n\n**2. Forward Step Analysis:**\nThis step evaluates the field from the source layer at $z=-d$ at the target plane $z=-h$. The vertical distance is $\\Delta z = (-h) - (-d) = d-h$. The Fourier operator for this step is $\\mathrm{e}^{-k(d-h)}$. The stability of this step depends critically on the sign of the exponent:\n*   **If $d > h$ (layer is deeper than the target plane):** The exponent $-(d-h)$ is negative. The operator $\\mathrm{e}^{-k(d-h)}$ is a low-pass filter. This is a stable upward continuation from the source layer.\n*   **If $d  h$ (layer is shallower than the target plane):** The exponent $-(d-h) = h-d$ is positive. The operator $\\mathrm{e}^{k(h-d)}$ is a high-pass filter. This is an unstable downward continuation from the source layer.\n\nTherefore, for the overall procedure to be numerically stable (after regularizing the first step), the second step must be stable. This requires choosing the equivalent layer depth $d$ to be greater than the continuation depth $h$.\n\n**3. Net Effect and Evaluation of Options**\nThe equivalent layer method cleverly restructures the single unstable problem of downward continuation (multiplying by $\\mathrm{e}^{kh}$) into two parts: an unstable (but regularized) inversion and a stable forward calculation.

In the Two-Dimensional Fourier Transform (2D-FT) domain, the net factor from mapping an equivalent layer at depth $d$ to the observation plane at $z=0$ and then downward continuing to $z=-h$ is $\\mathrm{e}^{k(h-d)}$, so choosing $dh$ suppresses high-$k$ amplification and stabilizes the continuation.**\nThis statement accurately describes the operator for the second (forward) step of the process, which maps the field from the equivalent layer at $z=-d$ to the final plane at $z=-h$. The operator is indeed $\\mathrm{e}^{-k(d-h)} = \\mathrm{e}^{k(h-d)}$. The conclusion is also correct: if $d>h$, the exponent is negative, which corresponds to a low-pass filter that suppresses high frequencies and makes this step stable. This is the correct principle for applying the equivalent layer method.\n\n**B. Setting $d=0$ maximizes stability because placing the equivalent layer at the observation plane minimizes kernel distances and the condition number of the forward operator.**\nThis is incorrect. Placing the sources at the observation points ($d=0$) makes the forward problem singular, as the potential $1/r$ is infinite when the source and observation points coincide. This leads to maximum instability, not stability.\n\n**C. Choosing $d$ arbitrarily large always improves both stability and resolution of the fitted model; therefore, it is recommended to set $d$ much larger than the station spacing and $h$.**\nThis is incorrect. Increasing $d$ makes the inverse step (finding the model) *less* stable because the upward continuation from the layer to the surface smooths the data more severely, making the inverse operator $\\mathrm{e}^{kd}$ grow faster. This also destroys the high-wavenumber information needed for a high-resolution model.\n\n**D. If $h\\ge d$, downward continuation remains stable because the harmonic field is uniquely defined everywhere and the equivalent layer reproduces it below the layer without amplification.**\nThis is incorrect.
