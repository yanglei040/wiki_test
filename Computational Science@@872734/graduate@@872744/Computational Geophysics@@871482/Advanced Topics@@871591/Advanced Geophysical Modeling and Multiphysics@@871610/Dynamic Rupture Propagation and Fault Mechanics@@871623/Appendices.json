The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principle of conservation of energy applied to frictional heating, a core concept in fault mechanics. The provided parameters are physically realistic for a seismic event. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe derivation begins with the first law of thermodynamics, asserting that the work done on the system is converted into internal energy, which manifests as heat. The process is assumed to be adiabatic, meaning no heat is lost from the gouge layer to the surrounding host rock over the event duration, $t$.\n\nThe mechanical work rate per unit area of the fault, or power density, $P_W$, is the product of the constant shear traction, $\\tau$, and the constant slip rate, $V$.\n$$P_W = \\tau V$$\nThe units of power density are watts per square meter ($\\mathrm{W/m^2}$).\n\nThe total mechanical energy per unit area, $E_{mech}$, generated during the event of duration $t$ is the integral of the power density over time.

Thus, the heat energy generated per unit area is:\n$$Q_{gen} = \\tau V t$$\n\nThis generated heat is absorbed by the gouge layer, raising its temperature by $\\Delta T$. The amount of heat absorbed, $Q_{abs}$, by a mass of material is given by $Q_{abs} = m c_p \\Delta T$, where $m$ is the mass and $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity. The problem provides the volumetric heat capacity, $\\rho c$, where $\\rho$ is the density and $c$ is the specific heat capacity. The heat absorbed by a volume $V_{gouge}$ is $Q_{abs} = (\\rho c) V_{gouge} \\Delta T$.\n\nWe are considering a unit area of the fault. The volume of the gouge layer per unit area is $V_{gouge} / A = h$, where $h$ is the thickness of the layer.

Substituting the strain definition into Hooke's law gives:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} + \\mu (\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^{\\top})\n$$\nSubstituting this constitutive relation into the equation of motion yields:\n$$\n\\rho\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} = \\nabla \\cdot [\\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} + \\mu (\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^{\\top})]\n$$\nUsing the vector identities $\\nabla \\cdot (f \\mathbf{I}) = \\nabla f$ and $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$ and assuming homogeneity (constant $\\lambda, \\mu$), the divergence of the stress simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2\\mathbf{u} + \\mu \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nThis results in the Navier-Cauchy equation of elastodynamics:\n$$\n\\rho\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} = (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nTo separate this vector wave equation into distinct wave types, we employ the Helmholtz decomposition, which expresses the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ as the sum of the gradient of a scalar potential $\\phi$ and the curl of a vector potential $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = \\nabla\\phi + \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\psi}\n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ represents the irrotational (compressional) part of the field and $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$ represents the solenoidal (equivoluminal) part. Substituting this into the Navier-Cauchy equation and using vector identities $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\psi}) = 0$ and $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\phi) = \\mathbf{0}$, we can separate the equation into two independent wave equations:\n\n1.  **Compressional (P-wave) equation**: Taking the divergence of the Navier-Cauchy equation leads to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} (\\nabla^2 \\phi) = \\frac{\\lambda + 2\\mu}{\\rho} \\nabla^2(\\nabla^2 \\phi) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial t^2} = c_p^2 \\nabla^2 \\phi\n    $$\n    The compressional-wave speed $c_p$ is thus:\n    $$\n    c_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda + 2\\mu}{\\rho}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Shear (S-wave) equation**: Taking the curl of the Navier-Cauchy equation leads to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} (\\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{\\psi}) = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho} \\nabla^2(\\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{\\psi}) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{\\psi}}{\\partial t^2} = c_s^2 \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{\\psi}\n    $$\n    The shear-wave speed $c_s$ is thus:\n    $$\n    c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}}\n    $$\nThese equations will be used to compute $c_p$ and $c_s$ for each test case.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Rayleigh Secular Equation\n\nRayleigh waves are surface waves that propagate along the free surface of an elastic half-space. Their amplitude decays exponentially with depth. We consider a plane harmonic wave propagating in the $x_1$-direction with wave number $k$ and angular frequency $\\omega$. The phase velocity is $c_R = \\omega/k$. The half-space occupies $x_3 \\ge 0$. The displacement potentials for a wave propagating along $x_1$ are assumed of the form:\n$$\n\\phi = A \\exp(-k \\nu_p x_3) \\exp[i(k x_1 - \\omega t)]\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\psi} = (0, B, 0) \\exp(-k \\nu_s x_3) \\exp[i(k x_1 - \\omega t)]\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are amplitudes. The attenuation factors $\\nu_p$ and $\\nu_s$ must be real and positive for the wave to be confined to the surface ($c_R  c_s  c_p$ ensures this). Substituting these forms into the wave equations derived in Part 1 yields:\n$$\n\\nu_p = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{c_R^2}{c_p^2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\nu_s = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{c_R^2}{c_s^2}}\n$$\nThe boundary condition at the free surface ($x_3=0$) is that it must be traction-free, i.e., $\\sigma_{31} = 0$ and $\\sigma_{33} = 0$. Expressing these stress components in terms of the potentials and applying the boundary conditions leads to a system of two linear homogeneous equations for the amplitudes $A$ and $B$. For a non-trivial solution to exist, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. This condition yields the Rayleigh secular equation:\n$$\n(2 - \\frac{c_R^2}{c_s^2})^2 = 4 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{c_R^2}{c_p^2}} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{c_R^2}{c_s^2}}\n$$\nTo obtain a dimensionless form suitable for numerical solution, we introduce the variables $\\xi = (c_R/c_s)^2$ and $\\alpha = (c_s/c_p)^2$. Note that $\\alpha = (\\mu/\\rho) / ((\\lambda+2\\mu)/\\rho) = \\mu/(\\lambda+2\\mu)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n(2 - \\xi)^2 = 4 \\sqrt{1 - \\alpha\\xi} \\sqrt{1 - \\xi}\n$$\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square roots gives:\n$$\n(2-\\xi)^4 = 16(1-\\alpha\\xi)(1-\\xi)\n$$\nExpanding and rearranging terms leads to a polynomial equation.\n$$\n\\xi^4 - 8\\xi^3 + 24\\xi^2 - 32\\xi + 16 = 16(1 - (1+\\alpha)\\xi + \\alpha\\xi^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\xi^4 - 8\\xi^3 + (24-16\\alpha)\\xi^2 - (32-16-16\\alpha)\\xi = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\xi [\\xi^3 - 8\\xi^2 + (24-16\\alpha)\\xi - 16(1-\\alpha)] = 0\n$$\nWe seek the non-trivial root $\\xi \\neq 0$. Thus, we must find the root of the cubic polynomial $P(\\xi)$:\n$$\nP(\\xi) = \\xi^3 - 8\\xi^2 + (24-16\\alpha)\\xi - 16(1-\\alpha) = 0\n$$\nFor physically realistic materials ($\\lambda \\ge 0, \\mu0$), $0  \\alpha \\le 0.5$. The physically admissible root for $\\xi$ must lie in the interval $(0, 1)$ corresponding to $0  c_R  c_s$. The cubic polynomial $P(\\xi)$ has exactly one real root in this interval.\n\n### Part 3: Algorithmic Implementation\n\nFor each set of material parameters $(\\lambda, \\mu, \\rho)$:\n1.  Compute $c_p = \\sqrt{(\\lambda + 2\\mu)/\\rho}$.\n2.  Compute $c_s = \\sqrt{\\mu/\\rho}$.\n3.  Compute the dimensionless parameter $\\alpha = \\mu/(\\lambda+2\\mu)$.\n4.  Define the cubic polynomial $P(\\xi)$ as derived above.\n5.  Numerically solve for the root of $P(\\xi)=0$ in the interval $(0, 1)$. A robust bracketing method like Brent's method is ideal.\n6.  Using the found root $\\xi_{root}$, calculate the Rayleigh wave speed as $c_R = c_s \\sqrt{\\xi_{root}}$.\n7.  Round the three speeds $c_p$, $c_s$, and $c_R$ to three decimal places.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for each of the provided test cases. We will utilize `scipy.optimize.brentq` for its robustness in finding the root of $P(\\xi)$ within the bracketed interval $[0, 1]$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for compressional, shear, and Rayleigh wave speeds for given material properties.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple of (lambda [Pa], mu [Pa], rho [kg/m^3]).\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        (40e9, 30e9, 2700),\n        # Case B (nearly incompressible)\n        (300e9, 30e9, 2700),\n        # Case C (low shear rigidity)\n        (40e9, 5e9, 2500),\n        # Case D\n        (60e9, 40e9, 3300),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for lame_lambda, mu, rho in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Derive and compute the body-wave speeds.\n        # Compressional-wave speed (P-wave)\n        c_p = np.sqrt((lame_lambda + 2 * mu) / rho)\n        \n        # Shear-wave speed (S-wave)\n        c_s = np.sqrt(mu / rho)\n\n        # Step 2: Derive and solve the Rayleigh secular equation.\n        # Dimensionless parameter alpha\n        alpha = mu / (lame_lambda + 2 * mu)\n        # alpha is equivalent to (c_s/c_p)^2\n\n        # The Rayleigh secular equation can be reduced to finding the root of a cubic polynomial P(xi):\n        # P(xi) = xi^3 - 8*xi^2 + (24-16*alpha)*xi - 16*(1-alpha)\n        # where xi = (c_R/c_s)^2.\n        # We need to find the physically admissible root in the interval (0, 1).\n        \n        def rayleigh_cubic_poly(xi, a):\n            \"\"\"\n            Cubic polynomial form of the Rayleigh secular equation.\n            \n            Args:\n                xi (float): (c_R/c_s)^2\n                a (float): (c_s/c_p)^2\n            \n            Returns:\n                float: Value of the polynomial.\n            \"\"\"\n            return xi**3 - 8*xi**2 + (24 - 16*a)*xi - 16*(1 - a)\n\n        # Use Brent's method to robustly find the root in the interval (0, 1).\n        # The polynomial is known to have a unique root in this interval for physical materials.\n        try:\n            xi_root = brentq(lambda xi: rayleigh_cubic_poly(xi, alpha), 0, 1)\n        except ValueError:\n            # Handle cases where the root might not be strictly between 0 and 1,\n            # though this is not expected for the given physical parameters.\n            xi_root = np.nan\n\n        # Calculate Rayleigh-wave speed\n        c_R = c_s * np.sqrt(xi_root) if not np.isnan(xi_root) else np.nan\n\n        # Step 3: Round all speeds to three decimal places.\n        case_result = [\n            np.round(c_p, 3),\n            np.round(c_s, 3),\n            np.round(c_R, 3),\n        ]\n        results.append(case_result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The str() representation of a list is '[item1, item2, ...]'\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3587022"}]}
