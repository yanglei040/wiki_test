It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in fluid mechanics, specifically a classic example of lubrication theory applied to Stokes flow. It is self-contained, with all necessary conditions and properties defined, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe flow is described as an incompressible, Newtonian fluid in the Stokes regime. In a cylindrical coordinate system ($r$, $\\theta$, $z$) with the origin at the center of the gap, and assuming axisymmetry ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta} = 0$) and no swirl velocity ($u_\\theta=0$), the governing equations are the continuity equation and the Stokes momentum equations.\n\nThe continuity equation for an incompressible fluid is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r u_r) + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nThe Stokes equations (momentum balance with negligible inertia) are:\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} + \\eta \\left[ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r}\\right) - \\frac{u_r}{r^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_r}{\\partial z^2} \\right] = 0 \\quad (r\\text{-momentum}) $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\eta \\left[ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] = 0 \\quad (z\\text{-momentum}) $$\nwhere $u_r$ and $u_z$ are the radial and vertical velocity components, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nThe problem specifies a slender gap, $h \\ll a$. This allows for the lubrication approximation. We perform a scaling analysis. The characteristic length scales are $a$ in the radial direction and $h$ in the vertical direction. Let $\\dot{h} = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}$. From the boundary conditions, the characteristic vertical velocity $U_z$ is of the order of $|\\dot{h}|$. From the continuity equation, $\\frac{U_r}{a} \\sim \\frac{U_z}{h}$, which implies the characteristic radial velocity is $U_r \\sim \\frac{a}{h} U_z \\sim \\frac{a}{h}|\\dot{h}|$.\n\nIn the $r$-momentum equation, the radial viscous terms scale as $\\eta \\frac{U_r}{a^2}$, while the vertical viscous term scales as $\\eta \\frac{U_r}{h^2}$. Since $h \\ll a$, we have $\\frac{h^2}{a^2} \\ll 1$, so the vertical term $\\frac{\\partial^2 u_r}{\\partial z^2}$ dominates the radial viscous terms. The $r$-momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 u_r}{\\partial z^2} $$\nIn the $z$-momentum equation, a similar analysis shows that the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}$ must balance the viscous term $\\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 u_z}{\\partial z^2}$. The pressure variation across the gap, $\\Delta p_z$, scales as $h \\cdot (\\eta U_z/h^2) = \\eta U_z/h$. The radial pressure variation, $\\Delta p_r$, scales with the terms in the simplified $r$-momentum equation, suggesting $\\frac{\\Delta p_r}{a} \\sim \\eta \\frac{U_r}{h^2}$, so $\\Delta p_r \\sim \\frac{\\eta a U_r}{h^2}$. The ratio of vertical to radial pressure variation is $\\frac{\\Delta p_z}{\\Delta p_r} \\sim \\frac{\\eta U_z/h}{\\eta a U_r/h^2} = \\frac{U_z h}{U_r a}$. Substituting $U_r \\sim U_z \\frac{a}{h}$, this ratio becomes $\\frac{h^2}{a^2} \\ll 1$. Thus, the pressure variation in the $z$ direction is negligible. We can assume $p = p(r)$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\nWith $p=p(r)$, the simplified $r$-momentum equation becomes $\\frac{dp}{dr} = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 u_r}{\\partial z^2}$. We integrate this twice with respect to $z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\frac{dp}{dr}z + C_1(r) $$\n$$ u_r(r,z) = \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\frac{dp}{dr}z^2 + C_1(r)z + C_2(r) $$\nThe boundary conditions are no-slip at the rigid boundaries $z = \\pm h/2$, i.e., $u_r(r, z=h/2) = 0$ and $u_r(r, z=-h/2) = 0$. By symmetry, the velocity profile must be an even function of $z$, which requires $C_1(r)=0$. Applying the condition at $z=h/2$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\frac{dp}{dr}\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2(r) \\implies C_2(r) = -\\frac{h^2}{8\\eta}\\frac{dp}{dr} $$\nSubstituting $C_2(r)$ gives the parabolic radial velocity profile:\n$$ u_r(r,z) = \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\frac{dp}{dr}\\left(z^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) $$\nNext, we compute the height-averaged radial velocity, $\\overline{u}_r(r)$:\n$$ \\overline{u}_r(r) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} u_r(r,z) dz = \\frac{1}{2\\eta h}\\frac{dp}{dr} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left(z^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) dz $$\n$$ \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left(z^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) dz = \\left[\\frac{z^3}{3} - \\frac{h^2}{4}z\\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = 2\\left(\\frac{h^3}{24} - \\frac{h^3}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{h^3}{6} $$\n$$ \\overline{u}_r(r) = \\frac{1}{2\\eta h}\\frac{dp}{dr}\\left(-\\frac{h^3}{6}\\right) = -\\frac{h^2}{12\\eta}\\frac{dp}{dr} $$\nTo find the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dr}$, we use the continuity equation, integrated over the gap height:\n$$ \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r u_r) + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} \\right) dz = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} u_r dz \\right) + \\left[u_z\\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = 0 $$\nThe integral is $h\\overline{u}_r$. The second term is evaluated using the no-penetration boundary conditions: $u_z(z=h/2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}$ and $u_z(z=-h/2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}$. Thus, $[u_z]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}$. The integrated continuity equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r h \\overline{u}_r) + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\overline{u}_r$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left( r h \\left(-\\frac{h^2}{12\\eta}\\frac{dp}{dr}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} $$\n$$ -\\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dp}{dr}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} \\implies \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dp}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{12\\eta}{h^3}\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} $$\nThis is the Reynolds equation for this problem.

For a periodic domain of side length $L$, the components of the wavevector are quantized: $k_x = \\frac{2\\pi \\ell_x}{L}$ and $k_y = \\frac{2\\pi \\ell_y}{L}$ for integers $\\ell_x, \\ell_y$.\n\nIn Fourier space, differential operators become algebraic multiplications:\n- Gradient: $\\nabla f \\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k} \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k})$\n- Divergence: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$\n- Laplacian: $\\nabla^2 f \\rightarrow -|\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = -(k_x^2 + k_y^2) \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k})$\n\nApplying this transformation to the governing equations yields a system of algebraic equations for the Fourier coefficients of each field for each wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$:\n\n1.  **Incompressibility:**\n    $$i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k}) = 0$$\n    This condition implies that the velocity vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$ is orthogonal to the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ in Fourier space.\n\n2.  **Composition Diffusion:**\n    $$-|\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k}) = -\\hat{S}(\\mathbf{k})$$\n    For any non-zero wavevector $\\mathbf{k} \\ne \\mathbf{0}$, the composition coefficient is directly determined by the source:\n    $$\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hat{S}(\\mathbf{k})}{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}$$\n    For the zero wavevector $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{0}$ (corresponding to the spatial mean), the equation becomes $0 = -\\hat{S}(\\mathbf{0})$. The provided source term has a zero mean ($\\hat{S}(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$) for the given test cases (where $m$ or $n$ is non-zero), so this is consistent. The equation does not constrain the mean composition $\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{0})$. However, as shown next, consistency of the momentum equation requires $\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{0})=0$.\n\n3.  **Momentum Balance:**\n    $$-i\\mathbf{k} \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k}) - \\mu |\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k}) + \\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k})\\, \\mathbf{g} = \\mathbf{0}$$\n    For $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{0}$, the equation reduces to $\\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{0})\\, \\mathbf{g} = \\mathbf{0}$. Given $\\Delta \\rho \\ne 0$ and $\\mathbf{g} \\ne \\mathbf{0}$ in general, we must enforce $\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$. The mean velocity $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{0})$ is undetermined by this equation, but in the absence of a net external force, we set the mean flow to zero, $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{0})=\\mathbf{0}$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{k} \\ne \\mathbf{0}$, we can solve for $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$. First, we eliminate the pressure $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k})$ by taking the dot product of the momentum equation with $i\\mathbf{k}$ and applying the incompressibility condition $i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k}) = 0$:\n$$i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot (-i\\mathbf{k} \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k})) - \\mu |\\mathbf{k}|^2 (i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})) + i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k})\\, \\mathbf{g}) = 0$$\n$$|\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k}) + i \\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k}) (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{g}) = 0$$\n$$\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k}) = -i \\frac{\\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k}) (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{g})}{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}$$\nSubstituting this back into the momentum equation:\n$$-i\\mathbf{k} \\left(-i \\frac{\\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k}) (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{g})}{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}\\right) - \\mu |\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k}) + \\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k})\\, \\mathbf{g} = \\mathbf{0}$$\n$$-\\frac{\\mathbf{k}(\\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k}) (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{g}))}{|\\mathbf{k}|^2} - \\mu |\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k}) + \\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k})\\, \\mathbf{g} = \\mathbf{0}$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$\\mu |\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k}) \\left( \\mathbf{g} - \\frac{\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{g})}{|\\mathbf{k}|^2} \\right)$$\nThe term in parentheses is a projection operator that projects the vector $\\mathbf{g}$ onto the plane perpendicular to $\\mathbf{k}$. Substituting $\\hat{c}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hat{S}(\\mathbf{k})/|\\mathbf{k}|^2$:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho\\, \\hat{S}(\\mathbf{k})}{\\mu |\\mathbf{k}|^4} \\left( \\mathbf{g} - \\frac{\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{g})}{|\\mathbf{k}|^2} \\right)$$\nThis provides the velocity spectrum for all $\\mathbf{k} \\ne \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n### **3. Numerical Algorithm and RMS Velocity**\n\nThe problem is solved numerically on an $N \\times N$ grid. The continuous Fourier series coefficients $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k})$ are replaced by their discrete counterparts from the FFT, which we denote $F_k$. For a field $f$ sampled on the grid, its 2D DFT is $F_k = \\sum_{j_x, j_y} f_{j_x, j_y} e^{-i(k_x x_{j_x} + k_y y_{j_y})}$. The governing equations retain the same form for these discrete coefficients.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  **Grid Setup:** Define a physical grid $(x_j, y_l)$ and a corresponding wavevector grid $(k_x, k_y)$ for an $N \\times N$ domain of size $L$. The angular wavenumbers are $k_i = 2\\pi f_i$, where $f_i$ are the frequencies given by `numpy.fft.fftfreq`.\n2.  **Source Term:** Evaluate the source $S(x,y)$ on the physical grid.\n3.  **FFT of Source:** Compute the 2D DFT of the source, $S_k = \\text{FFT2}(S(x,y))$.\n4.  **Velocity Spectrum:** Compute the DFT coefficients of the velocity components, $U_{x,k}$ and $U_{y,k}$, using the derived formula. With $\\mathbf{g} = (0, -g)$ and $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y)$, the components are:\n    $$U_{x,k} = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho\\, g}{\\mu} \\frac{S_k k_x k_y}{|\\mathbf{k}|^6}$$\n    $$U_{y,k} = -\\frac{\\Delta \\rho\\, g}{\\mu} \\frac{S_k k_x^2}{|\\mathbf{k}|^6}$$\n    These formulae are applied only where $|\\mathbf{k}| \\ne 0$. For $|\\mathbf{k}|=0$, $U_k = 0$.\n\n5.  **RMS Speed Calculation:** The root-mean-square speed $U_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ is computed using Parseval's theorem, which relates the integral of a squared function to the sum of its squared Fourier coefficients. For the 2D DFT as implemented in `numpy`:\n    $$\\sum_{j_x=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{j_y=0}^{N-1} |f(x_{j_x}, y_{j_y})|^2 = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{k_x, k_y} |F_k|^2$$\n    The definition of $U_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2$ can be approximated by a sum over the grid points:\n    $$U_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{1}{L^2}\\int_0^L\\int_0^L \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 \\,dx\\,dy \\approx \\frac{1}{L^2} \\sum_{j_x, j_y} \\|\\mathbf{u}(x_{j_x}, y_{j_y})\\|^2 \\left(\\frac{L}{N}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{j_x, j_y} \\|\\mathbf{u}_{j_x, j_y}\\|^2$$\n    Applying Parseval's theorem to each component of the velocity:\n    $$U_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left( \\sum_{j_x,j_y} |u_x|^2 + \\sum_{j_x,j_y} |u_y|^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{k} |U_{x,k}|^2 + \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{k} |U_{y,k}|^2 \\right)$$\n    $$U_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\left( |U_{x,k}|^2 + |U_{y,k}|^2 \\right) }$$\n    This allows for the efficient calculation of $U_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ directly from the computed velocity spectrum, without performing an inverse FFT.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve for Stokes flow for all test cases and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: (mu, delta_rho, g, S0, m, n)\n        (100.0, 10.0, 9.81, 1.0, 1, 1),\n        # Case B:\n        (100.0, 10.0, 9.81, 0.0, 1, 1),\n        # Case C:\n        (100000.0, 10.0, 9.81, 1.0, 1, 1),\n        # Case D:\n        (100.0, 10.0, 9.81, 1.0, 3, 2),\n        # Case E:\n        (100.0, 10.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1, 1),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        u_rms = calculate_rms_speed(*params)\n        results.append(f\"{u_rms:.6f}\")\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\ndef calculate_rms_speed(mu, delta_rho, g, S0, m, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the root-mean-square speed for a given set of physical parameters.\n\n    The method solves the steady, incompressible Stokes equations driven by buoyancy\n    in a 2D periodic domain using a spectral (FFT-based) method.\n\n    Parameters:\n    mu (float): Dynamic viscosity (Pa.s)\n    delta_rho (float): Density contrast per unit composition (kg/m^3)\n    g (float): Gravitational acceleration magnitude (m/s^2)\n    S0 (float): Source term amplitude (m^-2)\n    m, n (int): Wavenumbers of the source term\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The root-mean-square speed (U_rms) in m/s.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Grid and domain parameters as specified in the problem\n    L = 1.0  # m\n    N = 64\n    \n    # Handle trivial cases where no flow is expected\n    if S0 == 0.0 or g == 0.0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # 1.
