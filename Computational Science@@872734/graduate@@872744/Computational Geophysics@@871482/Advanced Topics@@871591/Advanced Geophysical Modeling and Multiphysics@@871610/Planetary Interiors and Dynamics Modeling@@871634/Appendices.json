For the ideal elastic spring with shear modulus $G$, the stress $\\sigma(t)$ is proportional to the elastic strain:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = G \\epsilon_{e}(t)\n$$\nFor the ideal Newtonian dashpot with viscosity $\\eta$, the stress $\\sigma(t)$ is proportional to the rate of change of viscous strain, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{v}(t) = d\\epsilon_{v}(t)/dt$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\eta \\frac{d\\epsilon_{v}(t)}{dt}\n$$\nIn a series arrangement, the stress is the same across both elements, as stated. We can express the strains and their rates in terms of the common stress $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{e}(t) = \\frac{1}{G}\\sigma(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon_{v}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\sigma(t)\n$$\nTo find a single constitutive equation for the entire Maxwell body, we differentiate the total strain equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d\\epsilon_{e}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{d\\epsilon_{v}(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThe rate of change of elastic strain is found by differentiating its constitutive law:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon_{e}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{G}\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the strain rates into the differentiated total strain equation yields the governing differential equation for the Maxwell model:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{G}\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\sigma(t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a time-harmonic loading, which is most conveniently analyzed in the frequency domain using complex phasors. We let $\\sigma(t)$ and $\\epsilon(t)$ be represented by their complex forms, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0}\\exp(i \\omega t)$ and $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{0}\\exp(i \\omega t)$. The time derivative operator $d/dt$ is then replaced by multiplication with $i\\omega$.

To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator of the expression for $G^{*}(\\omega)$ by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $(G - i\\omega\\eta)$:\n$$\nG^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{i\\omega G \\eta}{G + i\\omega\\eta} \\times \\frac{G - i\\omega\\eta}{G - i\\omega\\eta}\n$$\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\n(i\\omega G \\eta)(G - i\\omega\\eta) = i\\omega G^{2}\\eta - (i\\omega\\eta)^{2}G = i\\omega G^{2}\\eta - (i^{2}\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2})G = i\\omega G^{2}\\eta + \\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}G\n$$\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$\n(G + i\\omega\\eta)(G - i\\omega\\eta) = G^{2} - (i\\omega\\eta)^{2} = G^{2} - i^{2}\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2} = G^{2} + \\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}\n$$\nCombining these, we get $G^{*}(\\omega)$ in its separated real and imaginary parts:\n$$\nG^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{G\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2} + i\\omega G^{2}\\eta}{G^{2} + \\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}} = \\frac{G\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}}{G^{2} + \\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}} + i \\frac{\\omega G^{2}\\eta}{G^{2} + \\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}}\n$$\nFrom this form, we can directly identify the storage and loss moduli by taking the real and imaginary parts, respectively.\nThe storage modulus is:\n$$\nG^{\\prime}(\\omega) = \\mathrm{Re}\\{G^{*}(\\omega)\\} = \\frac{G \\omega^{2} \\eta^{2}}{G^{2} + \\omega^{2} \\eta^{2}}\n$$\nThe loss modulus is:\n$$\nG^{\\prime\\prime}(\\omega) = \\mathrm{Im}\\{G^{*}(\\omega)\\} = \\frac{\\omega G^{2} \\eta}{G^{2} + \\omega^{2} \\eta^{2}}\n$$\nThese are the required explicit expressions for the storage and loss moduli.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{i\\omega G \\eta}{G + i\\omega\\eta}  \\frac{G \\omega^{2} \\eta^{2}}{G^{2} + \\omega^{2} \\eta^{2}}  \\frac{\\omega G^{2} \\eta}{G^{2} + \\omega^{2} \\eta^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3612886"}, {"introduction": "The motion of fluids within a planet is a constant battle between buoyancy forces that drive convection and stratifying effects that resist it.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Brunt–Väisälä frequency $N$ characterizes the oscillation frequency of a fluid parcel displaced vertically in a stably stratified fluid under gravity. Its square, $N^2$, is derived from the linearized vertical momentum equation.\n\nConsider a fluid parcel at an initial vertical position $z$. Its density is the local background density, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\rho(z)$. Now, let this parcel be displaced by a small vertical distance $\\delta z$ to a new position $z' = z + \\delta z$. The ambient density at this new location is $\\rho_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\rho(z')$.\n\nBecause the problem states that composition $c$ is materially conserved for the parcel, its composition does not change upon displacement.

Let's separate the constant parameters from the temperature-dependent part.\n$$\nQ_{\\text{out}} = A a \\left( \\frac{\\rho g \\alpha D^3}{\\kappa \\eta} \\right)^{\\beta} (T_m - T_s)^{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{k}{D} \\cdot (T_m - T_s)^1\n$$\nCombining the terms involving $(T_m - T_s)$ yields:\n$$\n(T_m - T_s)^{\\beta} (T_m - T_s)^1 = (T_m - T_s)^{\\beta+1}\n$$\nSo, the full expression for the surface heat loss is:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{out}} = \\left[ A a \\frac{k}{D} \\left( \\frac{\\rho g \\alpha D^3}{\\kappa \\eta} \\right)^{\\beta} \\right] (T_m - T_s)^{1+\\beta}\n$$\nThis expression is a power-law function of $(T_m - T_s)$, as required. The composite prefactor in the square brackets is a constant based on the model's fundamental physical quantities. The exponent of this power law is clearly $1+\\beta$.\n\nFinally, assembling the full energy balance ODE, we equate the rate of change of internal energy with the difference between heating and heat loss:\n$$\n(\\rho c_p V) \\frac{dT_m}{dt} = H V - \\left[ A a \\frac{k}{D} \\left( \\frac{\\rho g \\alpha D^3}{\\kappa \\eta} \\right)^{\\beta} \\right] (T_m - T_s)^{1+\\beta}\n$$\nThis is the desired ODE. The surface heat-loss term is on the right-hand side. It consists of a composite prefactor multiplying $(T_m - T_s)$ raised to a power $b$. By inspection of the derived term, this exponent is $b = 1+\\beta$. The question asks for this exponent $b$ in terms of $\\beta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1+\\beta}$$", "id": "3612857"}]}
