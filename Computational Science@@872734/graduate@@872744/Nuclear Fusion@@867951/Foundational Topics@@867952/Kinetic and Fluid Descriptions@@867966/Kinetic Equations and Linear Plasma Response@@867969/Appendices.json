All necessary parameters and physical assumptions are provided. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Logarithmic Factor**\n\nThe Landau collision operator, which is a limiting form of the Boltzmann collision integral for a weakly coupled plasma, describes the evolution of a particle distribution function due to the cumulative effect of many small-angle Coulomb collisions. The coefficients of this operator, representing dynamical friction and velocity-space diffusion, can be derived by analyzing the statistics of velocity changes in binary encounters.\n\nConsider a test electron with charge $-e$, mass $m_e$, and initial velocity $\\vec{v}$ interacting with a field of singly charged ions ($Z=1$) of charge $+e$. We assume the ions are infinitely massive ($m_i \\to \\infty$) and thus stationary. This simplifies the analysis as the reduced mass of the electron-ion pair is $\\mu = \\frac{m_e m_i}{m_e + m_i} \\approx m_e$, and the relative velocity is simply the electron's velocity, $\\vec{g} \\approx \\vec{v}$.\n\nThe interaction is governed by the Coulomb potential. In a single binary collision, an electron with impact parameter $b$ and speed $v$ is deflected by an angle $\\theta$. The exact Rutherford scattering formula relates these quantities:\n$$\n\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 b \\mu g^2}\n$$\nIn our case, with $Z=1$, $\\mu \\approx m_e$, and $g \\approx v$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 b m_e v^2}\n$$\nSince the Coulomb force is long-range, the dominant contribution to transport comes from distant encounters where the impact parameter $b$ is large and the scattering angle $\\theta$ is small. In the small-angle approximation ($\\theta \\ll 1$), we have $\\tan(\\theta/2) \\approx \\theta/2$. The scattering angle is then:\n$$\n\\theta \\approx \\frac{e^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 b m_e v^2}\n$$\nDuring such a collision, the electron's velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ changes. We can decompose this change into components parallel ($\\Delta \\vec{v}_{\\parallel}$) and perpendicular ($\\Delta \\vec{v}_{\\perp}$) to the initial velocity. For small angles, the change in speed is negligible, so the velocity change is primarily a rotation. The magnitude of the perpendicular velocity change is:\n$$\n|\\Delta \\vec{v}_{\\perp}| = v \\sin\\theta \\approx v\\theta = \\frac{e^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 b m_e v}\n$$\nThe parallel velocity change, $\\Delta v_{\\parallel} = v(\\cos\\theta - 1) \\approx -v\\theta^2/2$, is of second order in $\\theta$ and is much smaller than $\\Delta v_{\\perp}$.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient is related to the mean square velocity change per unit time. We can calculate this by integrating the effect of collisions over all impact parameters. An electron traveling with speed $v$ sweeps out a cylindrical volume. The number of ions it encounters per unit time with impact parameters in the range $[b, b+db]$ is given by the ion flux through an annulus of area $2\\pi b db$. This rate is $dN = n_i v (2\\pi b db)$, where $n_i$ is the ion number density. For a quasi-neutral hydrogenic plasma with $Z=1$, we have $n_i = n_e$.\n\nThe contribution to the mean square perpendicular velocity change per unit time from encounters in this annulus is:\n$$\nd\\langle(\\Delta v_{\\perp})^2\\rangle = (\\Delta v_{\\perp})^2 dN = \\left(\\frac{e^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 b m_e v}\\right)^2 (n_e v (2\\pi b db))\n$$\n$$\nd\\langle(\\Delta v_{\\perp})^2\\rangle = \\frac{e^4}{(2\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 m_e^2 v^2 b^2} (2\\pi n_e v b db) = \\frac{2\\pi n_e e^4}{(2\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 m_e^2 v} \\frac{db}{b}\n$$\nThe total rate of change, which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient, is found by integrating over all relevant impact parameters from a minimum cutoff $b_{min}$ to a maximum cutoff $b_{max}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle(\\Delta v_{\\perp})^2\\rangle}{dt} \\propto \\int_{b_{min}}^{b_{max}} \\frac{db}{b} = [\\ln b]_{b_{min}}^{b_{max}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{b_{max}}{b_{min}}\\right)\n$$\nThis demonstrates the emergence of the logarithmic factor, known as the Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln \\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda = b_{max}/b_{min}$. The integral diverges if the cutoffs are not introduced, reflecting the breakdown of the binary collision model at both very small and very large distances. A similar logarithmic factor appears in the calculation of the dynamical friction coefficient.\n\n**Part 2: Physical Justification of the Cutoffs**\n\nThe values of $b_{max}$ and $b_{min}$ are determined by physical scales where the assumptions of our model break down.\n\n1.  **Upper Cutoff ($b_{max}$)**: The assumption of an isolated binary collision with a pure $1/r$ potential fails at large distances in a plasma. The electrostatic field of any given charge is screened by the collective response of mobile surrounding charges (primarily electrons). This screening effect becomes significant at distances comparable to the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. An electron passing an ion at an impact parameter $b > \\lambda_D$ experiences a much weaker, short-range screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. Therefore, collisions with $b > \\lambda_D$ are ineffective and contribute negligibly. We thus set the upper cutoff to the electron Debye length:\n    $$\n    b_{max} = \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Lower Cutoff ($b_{min}$)**: The model also fails at very small impact parameters for two reasons.\n    *   **Classical breakdown**: The small-angle approximation ($\\theta \\ll 1$) is violated. A strong collision occurs when the deflection angle is large. A standard choice for the lower cutoff is the impact parameter that would cause a $90^\\circ$ deflection, which we denote as $b_c$. From the exact Rutherford formula with $\\theta=\\pi/2$, we have $\\tan(\\pi/4) = 1$. This corresponds to the distance at which the potential energy of interaction is comparable to the initial kinetic energy of relative motion, $E_k$. Taking $E_k$ as the characteristic thermal energy of the electrons, we have:\n      $$\n      b_c = \\frac{Z e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 E_k}\n      $$\n    *   **Quantum breakdown**: At very small scales, the classical concept of a particle trajectory becomes invalid due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The position of the electron is only defined within a scale of its thermal de Broglie wavelength, $\\lambda_{dB}$. A collision with an impact parameter smaller than $\\lambda_{dB}$ cannot be treated classically and must be described by quantum scattering theory (diffraction). The relevant scale is:\n      $$\n      b_q = \\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{\\hbar}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m_e v} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2 m_e E_k}}\n      $$\n    The small-angle model breaks down at the larger of these two scales. Thus, the lower cutoff is:\n    $$\n    b_{min} = \\max(b_c, b_q)\n    $$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the Coulomb logarithm for a hydrogenic ($Z=1$) plasma with $T_e = 10\\,\\text{keV}$ and $n_e = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$.\n\nWe use the following constants:\n- Elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\, \\text{C}$\n- Vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_0 \\approx 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\, \\text{F/m}$\n- Boltzmann constant, $k_B \\approx 1.381 \\times 10^{-23}\\, \\text{J/K}$\n- Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar \\approx 1.055 \\times 10^{-34}\\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n- Electron mass, $m_e \\approx 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\, \\text{kg}$\n\nThe given electron temperature is $T_e = 10\\,\\text{keV}$.

For cold ions ($T_i \\rightarrow 0$), the equilibrium distribution is a delta function, $f_{i0}(\\mathbf{v}) = n_{i0} \\delta(\\mathbf{v})$, where $n_{i0}=n_{e0}$ due to equilibrium charge neutrality for a singly-ionized plasma ($Z=1$). We derive the fluid equations by taking moments of the Vlasov equation for ions, with $q_i=e$ and $m_i$.\n\nThe zeroth moment (continuity equation) is found by integrating the Vlasov equation over velocity space:\n$$\n\\int \\left( -i\\omega f_{i1} + ikv_x f_{i1} - \\frac{ie\\phi_1 k}{m_i} \\frac{\\partial f_{i0}}{\\partial v_x} \\right) dv_x = 0\n$$\nDefining the perturbed density $n_{i1} = \\int f_{i1} dv_x$ and the perturbed fluid velocity $u_{i1} = \\frac{1}{n_{i0}}\\int v_x f_{i1} dv_x$, this yields:\n$$\n-i\\omega n_{i1} + ik n_{i0} u_{i1} - \\frac{ie\\phi_1 k}{m_i} \\left[ f_{i0} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = 0\n$$\nThe last term vanishes as $f_{i0} \\rightarrow 0$ for $|v_x| \\rightarrow \\infty$.

The dispersion relation is $1 + \\frac{1}{k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} - \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2} = 0$.\nSolving for $\\omega^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} = \\frac{1+k^2\\lambda_{De}^2}{k^2\\lambda_{De}^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2 k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2}{1+k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} = \\frac{(\\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_i}) k^2 (\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 T_e}{n_0 e^2})}{1+k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} = \\frac{k^2 T_e/m_i}{1+k^2\\lambda_{De}^2}\n$$\nThus, the dispersion relation from the full Poisson-coupled system is:\n$$\n\\omega_P^2 = \\frac{k^2 C_s^2}{1+k^2\\lambda_{De}^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the quasineutral limit dispersion by imposing $n_{e1} \\approx n_{i1}$ (since $Z=1$). This approximation implies neglecting space charge effects and is equivalent to the long-wavelength limit ($k\\lambda_{De} \\ll 1$).\n$$\nn_{e1} = n_{i1} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{n_0 e \\phi_1}{T_e} = \\frac{k^2 n_0 e \\phi_1}{m_i \\omega^2}\n$$\nAgain, for $\\phi_1 \\neq 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_e} = \\frac{k^2}{m_i \\omega^2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$ gives the quasineutral dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\omega_{QN}^2 = \\frac{k^2 T_e}{m_i} = k^2 C_s^2\n$$\n\nThe fractional error $\\delta$ is defined as $\\delta = \\frac{|\\omega_{\\mathrm{QN}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{P}}|}{|\\omega_{\\mathrm{P}}|}$.
