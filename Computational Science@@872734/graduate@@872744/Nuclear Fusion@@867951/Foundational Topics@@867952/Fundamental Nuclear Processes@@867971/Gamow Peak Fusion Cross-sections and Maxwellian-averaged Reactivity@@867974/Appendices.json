The problem describes the determination of a threshold energy for the $l=1$ partial wave in deuterium-tritium fusion using a semiclassical model. It provides all necessary physical relationships, definitions, and constants. The model, while simplified (e.g., the hard-sphere absorption radius and the specific threshold condition $b=R$), is based on established principles of quantum scattering theory, including the concepts of partial waves, impact parameter, and the centrifugal barrier. The data provided are physically accurate and consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem asks for the threshold energy $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$ for the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$ partial wave to contribute significantly to the fusion cross-section. The physical reasoning for the given threshold condition, $b=R$ for $l=1$, stems from a simplified geometric and semiclassical picture of the collision. In quantum scattering, the total cross-section is a sum over contributions from all partial waves, indexed by $l$. At low energies, the interaction is dominated by the $l=0$ (s-wave) component because higher-$l$ waves face an effective potential barrier, the centrifugal barrier, given by $V_{\\mathrm{cent}} = \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 l(l+1)}{2\\mu r^2}$, which makes it classically forbidden for the particles to approach each other closely.\n\nThe impact parameter $b$ is the classical perpendicular distance between the trajectories of the colliding particles if they were to not interact. In the semiclassical approximation, angular momentum $L$ is quantized and related to the impact parameter $b$ and momentum $p=\\hbar k$ by $L = b p = b \\hbar k$. The quantum mechanical value of the angular momentum magnitude is approximately $L \\approx \\hbar(l+1/2)$. Equating these gives the relation $b \\hbar k \\approx \\hbar (l+1/2)$, leading to $b \\approx (l+1/2)/k$.\n\nThe problem defines the nuclear interaction to be significant only when the particles' trajectories are within a distance $R$ of each other, modeled as an effective absorption radius. The condition $b=R$ is therefore postulated as the threshold for an interaction corresponding to a given partial wave $l$ and energy $E$. For an impact parameter $b > R$, the particles are considered too far apart to interact strongly via the nuclear force. Thus, the threshold energy $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$ for the $l=1$ wave is the minimum energy at which a collision with $l=1$ corresponds to an impact parameter equal to the nuclear radius $R$.\n\nWe begin the derivation with the provided relations:\n1. Impact parameter: $b \\approx \\frac{l+1/2}{k}$\n2. Wave number: $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu E}}{\\hbar}$\n\nThe threshold condition is for the $l=1$ partial wave. Substituting $l=1$ into the impact parameter equation gives:\n$$\nb = \\frac{1+1/2}{k} = \\frac{3}{2k}\n$$\nThe problem states that the threshold energy $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is the energy at which $b=R$. Let $k_{\\mathrm{th}}$ be the wave number corresponding to $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The condition becomes:\n$$\nR = \\frac{3}{2k_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n$$\nFrom this, we can solve for $k_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{3}{2R}\n$$\nNow we use the definition of the wave number at the threshold energy:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu E_{\\mathrm{th}}}}{\\hbar}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $k_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu E_{\\mathrm{th}}}}{\\hbar} = \\frac{3}{2R}\n$$\nTo solve for $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\mu E_{\\mathrm{th}}}{\\hbar^2} = \\frac{9}{4R^2}\n$$\nSolving for $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$ yields the closed-form expression:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{9\\hbar^2}{8\\mu R^2}\n$$\nFor practical calculations involving nuclear physics units, it is convenient to use $\\hbar c$ and rest mass energies ($m c^2$). We can rewrite the expression as:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{9(\\hbar c)^2}{8(\\mu c^2) R^2}\n$$\nNext, we compute the numerical values for the terms in this expression.\n\nFirst, the nuclear absorption radius $R$ is calculated using the given formula:\n$$\nR = r_0 \\left(A_D^{1/3} + A_T^{1/3}\\right)\n$$\nWith $r_0=1.2\\,\\mathrm{fm}$, $A_D=2$, and $A_T=3$:\n$$\nR = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{fm} \\times (2^{1/3} + 3^{1/3}) \\approx 1.2\\,\\mathrm{fm} \\times (1.259921 + 1.442250) = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{fm} \\times 2.702171 \\approx 3.242605\\,\\mathrm{fm}\n$$\nSo, $R^2 \\approx (3.242605\\,\\mathrm{fm})^2 \\approx 10.51448\\,\\mathrm{fm}^2$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the reduced mass energy equivalent, $\\mu c^2$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear fusion, specifically relating the reaction cross section to the Maxwellian-averaged reactivity. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, models, constants, and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and the setup is internally consistent.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four main stages:\n1.  Derivation of the integral expression for the Maxwellian-averaged reactivity, $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$, from first principles.\n2.  Derivation of the gradient of the reactivity with respect to the astrophysical $S$-factor polynomial coefficients, $\\mathbf{a}$.\n3.  Formulation of the uncertainty propagation using the derived gradient and the given covariance matrix.\n4.  Numerical implementation to compute the required quantities for each test case.\n\nAll calculations are performed in SI units.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Maxwellian-Averaged Reactivity**\n\nThe Maxwellian-averaged reactivity $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ is the thermal average of the product of the fusion cross section $\\sigma$ and the relative speed $v$ over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of relative speeds for a two-particle system with reduced mass $\\mu$ at temperature $T$. The probability distribution for relative speed $v$ is given by:\n$$\nP(v)dv = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^2}{2 k_B T}\\right) dv,\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The reactivity is then:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma(v) v \\, P(v) \\, dv = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma(v) v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^2}{2 k_B T}\\right) dv.\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we change the integration variable from speed $v$ to center-of-mass energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v^2$. The differential relation is $dE = \\mu v dv$, which gives $v dv = \\frac{1}{\\mu} dE$. We can express the term $v^3 dv$ as $v^2 (v dv) = \\left(\\frac{2E}{\\mu}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu} dE\\right) = \\frac{2E}{\\mu^2} dE$. The cross section $\\sigma(v)$ becomes $\\sigma(E)$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma(E) \\frac{2E}{\\mu^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dE.\n$$\nSimplifying the pre-factor:\n$$\n4\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\mu^{3/2}}{(2\\pi)^{3/2} (k_B T)^{3/2}}\\right) \\frac{2}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{8\\pi}{(2\\pi)^{3/2} \\mu^{1/2} (k_B T)^{3/2}} = \\frac{8\\pi}{2\\pi\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\mu}(k_B T)^{3/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\right)^{3/2}.\n$$\nThus, the Maxwellian-averaged reactivity as an integral over energy is:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty E \\, \\sigma(E) \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dE.\n$$\n\n**2. Substitution of the Cross Section Model and Gradient Derivation**\n\nThe problem specifies a non-resonant cross section model:\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\frac{S(E)}{E} \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $S(E)$ is the astrophysical $S$-factor and $E_G$ is the Gamow energy, defined as $E_G = 2\\mu c^2 (\\pi \\alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2$. Substituting this into the reactivity expression yields:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\infty E \\left( \\frac{S(E)}{E} \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}}\\right) \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dE.\n$$\nThe factor $E$ cancels, simplifying the integral to:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = C_T \\int_0^\\infty S(E) \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}} - \\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dE,\n$$\nwhere we define the temperature-dependent constant $C_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\right)^{3/2}$. The $S$-factor is modeled as a polynomial $S(E) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_i E^i$. Substituting this into the reactivity equation:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = C_T \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_i E^i \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}} - \\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dE.\n$$\nSince integration and summation are linear operations, we can swap their order:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(T) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_i \\left[ C_T \\int_0^\\infty E^i \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}} - \\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dE \\right].\n$$\nThis shows that $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ is a linear function of the coefficients $a_i$. The gradient vector $\\mathbf{J} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{a}} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ has components $J_i = \\frac{\\partial \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle}{\\partial a_i}$. From the expression above, we can directly find each component:\n$$\nJ_i = \\frac{\\partial \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle}{\\partial a_i} = C_T \\int_0^\\infty E^i \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}} - \\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dE.\n$$\nThe mean reactivity can thus be written compactly as a dot product: $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = \\mathbf{J}^\\top \\mathbf{a}$.\n\n**3. Uncertainty Propagation**\n\nThe problem requires first-order linear error propagation to find the uncertainty in the reactivity, $\\sigma_f$, from the uncertainties in the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$. The variance of a function $f(\\mathbf{a})$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[f] \\approx \\mathbf{J}^\\top \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{J},\n$$\nwhere $f(\\mathbf{a}) = \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle(\\mathbf{a})$, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the gradient (Jacobian) vector derived above, and $\\mathbf{C}$ is the covariance matrix of the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$. The problem provides the standard deviations of the coefficients, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_0, \\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_N)^\\top$, and their correlation matrix $\\mathbf{R}$. The covariance matrix is constructed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\, \\mathbf{R} \\, \\mathrm{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}).\n$$\nThe one-standard-deviation uncertainty in the reactivity is $\\sigma_f = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle]}$. The $68\\%$ and $95\\%$ symmetric confidence intervals are then calculated as $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\pm \\sigma_f$ and $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\pm 1.96\\,\\sigma_f$, respectively.\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the required physical constants in SI units: the reduced mass $\\mu$ from the given masses of deuterium and tritium, the fine-structure constant $\\alpha = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\hbar c}$, and the Gamow energy $E_G$.\n2.  For the given temperature $T$, compute the thermal energy scale $k_B T$ and the pre-factor $C_T$.\n3.  For each coefficient $a_i$ (from $i=0$ to $N$), numerically evaluate the corresponding integral to find the gradient component $J_i$. This is done using a standard numerical quadrature routine, such as `scipy.integrate.quad`, over the integration range $E \\in [0, \\infty)$. The integrand is composed of the basis function $E^i$ and the characteristic Gamow peak term $\\exp(-\\sqrt{E_G/E} - E/k_B T)$, which is well-behaved and converges for large $E$.\n4.  Assemble the gradient vector $\\mathbf{J}$.\n5.  Calculate the mean reactivity $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = \\mathbf{J}^\\top \\mathbf{a}$.\n6.  Construct the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ from the given $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$.\n7.  Calculate the variance $\\sigma_f^2 = \\mathbf{J}^\\top \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{J}$ and the standard deviation $\\sigma_f$.\n8.  Compute the endpoints for the $68\\%$ and $95\\%$ confidence intervals.\nThis procedure is repeated for all test cases provided in the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\nfrom scipy.constants import k, e, epsilon_0, hbar, c\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of propagating uncertainties from S-factor coefficients\n    to the Maxwellian-averaged reactivity for D-T fusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
