It is based on standard principles of plasma physics and hydrodynamics. All necessary information and assumptions are provided, and the tasks are clearly defined.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the thermal pressure $P(\\rho, T)$ and specific internal energy $u(\\rho, T)$.\n\nThe problem specifies a fully ionized, equimolar Deuterium-Tritium (DT) plasma. Let $n_D$ be the number density of deuterium ions and $n_T$ be the number density of tritium ions. Since the mixture is equimolar, $n_D = n_T$. The total ion number density is $n_i = n_D + n_T = 2n_D$.\n\nThe problem defines an effective ion mass $m_i$ as the arithmetic mean of the deuterium ion mass $m_D$ and tritium ion mass $m_T$: $m_i = \\frac{m_D + m_T}{2}$.\n\nThe mass density $\\rho$ is given by the sum of the mass densities of all species. The electron mass $m_e$ is negligible compared to the ion masses ($m_e \\ll m_D, m_T$). Therefore, the total mass density is dominated by the ions:\n$\\rho \\approx n_D m_D + n_T m_T$.\nSince $n_D = n_T = n_i/2$, we have:\n$\\rho = \\frac{n_i}{2} m_D + \\frac{n_i}{2} m_T = n_i \\left(\\frac{m_D + m_T}{2}\\right) = n_i m_i$.\nFrom this, the total ion number density can be expressed in terms of the mass density and effective ion mass:\n$n_i = \\frac{\\rho}{m_i}$.\n\nThe plasma is fully ionized, and both deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, so their ions have a charge number $Z=1$. Under the assumption of quasi-neutrality, the electron number density $n_e$ is related to the ion number density by $n_e = Z n_i$. For $Z=1$, we have $n_e = n_i$.\n\nThe total number density of particles (ions and electrons) is $n = n_i + n_e = n_i + n_i = 2n_i$.\nSubstituting the expression for $n_i$:\n$n = \\frac{2\\rho}{m_i}$.\n\nThe plasma is described by an ideal gas Equation of State (EOS). The total thermal pressure $P$ is the sum of the partial pressures of the ions ($P_i$) and electrons ($P_e$). Assuming both species are at the same temperature $T$:\n$P = P_i + P_e = n_i k_B T + n_e k_B T = (n_i + n_e) k_B T = n k_B T$.\nSubstituting the expression for the total number density $n$, we obtain the thermal pressure as a function of $\\rho$ and $T$:\n$P(\\rho, T) = \\left(\\frac{2\\rho}{m_i}\\right) k_B T = \\frac{2\\rho k_B T}{m_i}$.\n\nNext, we derive the specific internal energy $u(\\rho, T)$, which is the internal energy per unit mass. For a classical ideal gas, the average kinetic energy per particle is $\\frac{3}{2} k_B T$ (for $3$ degrees of freedom). The total internal energy $U$ in a volume $V$ is the total number of particles $N$ times the average energy per particle.\n$U = N \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2} k_B T\\right)$.\nThe total number of particles is $N = N_i + N_e = 2N_i$, where $N_i$ and $N_e$ are the total number of ions and electrons, respectively.\n$U = (2N_i) \\left(\\frac{3}{2} k_B T\\right) = 3N_i k_B T$.\nThe total mass $M$ in the volume $V$ is, neglecting electron mass, $M \\approx N_i m_i$.\nThe specific internal energy $u$ is $u = U/M$.\n$u = \\frac{3N_i k_B T}{N_i m_i} = \\frac{3k_B T}{m_i}$.\nThus, the specific internal energy is $u(\\rho, T) = \\frac{3 k_B T}{m_i}$. Note that for an ideal gas, the specific internal energy is a function of temperature only.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the post-shock to pre-shock pressure ratio.\n\nWe consider a planar, stationary normal shock. The Rankine-Hugoniot relations express the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across the shock front. Let the pre-shock (upstream) state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the post-shock (downstream) state by subscript $2$. The fluid velocities are measured in the frame of the shock.\n\n1.  Mass conservation: $\\rho_1 v_1 = \\rho_2 v_2$.\n2.  Momentum conservation: $P_1 + \\rho_1 v_1^2 = P_2 + \\rho_2 v_2^2$.\n3.  Energy conservation: $h_1 + \\frac{1}{2}v_1^2 = h_2 + \\frac{1}{2}v_2^2$, where $h$ is the specific enthalpy.\n\nThe specific enthalpy $h$ for an ideal gas is $h = u + P/\\rho$. From the ideal gas law, the internal energy density $\\mathcal{E} = \\rho u$ is related to pressure by $\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{P}{\\gamma-1}$, where $\\gamma$ is the adiabatic index. Thus, $u = \\frac{P}{\\rho(\\gamma-1)}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of enthalpy:\n$h = \\frac{P}{\\rho(\\gamma-1)} + \\frac{P}{\\rho} = \\frac{P}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1} + 1\\right) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\frac{P}{\\rho}$.\n\nWe now combine the conservation laws to relate the thermodynamic states ($P$, $\\rho$) across the shock. A standard derived form of the Rankine-Hugoniot relations, which can be found by algebraic manipulation of the three conservation equations, is:\n$h_2 - h_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(P_2 - P_1)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho_1} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_2}\\right)$.\nSubstituting the expression for specific enthalpy:\n$\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{P_2}{\\rho_2} - \\frac{P_1}{\\rho_1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(P_2 - P_1)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho_1} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_2}\\right)$.\nLet the pressure ratio be $\\Pi = P_2/P_1$ and the compression ratio be $X = \\rho_2/\\rho_1$. Dividing the equation by $P_1/\\rho_1$:\n$\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{P_2/P_1}{\\rho_2/\\rho_1} - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1} - 1\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}\\right)$.\n$\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{\\Pi}{X} - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Pi - 1)\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{X}\\right)$.\n$\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\frac{\\Pi - X}{X} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Pi - 1)\\frac{X+1}{X}$.\n$2\\gamma(\\Pi - X) = (\\gamma-1)(\\Pi-1)(X+1)$.\nThis equation relates the pressure ratio $\\Pi$ to the compression ratio $X$. We now introduce the upstream Mach number $M_1 = v_1 / c_{s1}$, where $c_{s1} = \\sqrt{\\gamma P_1 / \\rho_1}$ is the sound speed in the upstream medium.\nFrom the momentum conservation equation:\n$P_2 - P_1 = \\rho_1 v_1^2 - \\rho_2 v_2^2$.\nUsing mass conservation, $v_2 = v_1(\\rho_1/\\rho_2)$, we get:\n$P_2 - P_1 = \\rho_1 v_1^2 - \\rho_2 \\left(v_1 \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}\\right)^2 = \\rho_1 v_1^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}\\right)$.\nDividing by $P_1$:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} - 1 = \\frac{\\rho_1 v_1^2}{P_1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}\\right)$.\nThe term $\\frac{\\rho_1 v_1^2}{P_1}$ can be written in terms of the Mach number:\n$\\frac{\\rho_1 v_1^2}{P_1} = \\gamma \\frac{v_1^2}{\\gamma P_1/\\rho_1} = \\gamma \\frac{v_1^2}{c_{s1}^2} = \\gamma M_1^2$.\nSo, $\\Pi - 1 = \\gamma M_1^2 (1 - 1/X) = \\gamma M_1^2 \\frac{X-1}{X}$.\nWe have two equations relating $\\Pi$, $X$, and $M_1$. We need to eliminate $X$ to find $\\Pi$ in terms of $M_1$.\nLet's solve the first equation for $X$:\n$2\\gamma\\Pi - 2\\gamma X = (\\gamma-1)(\\Pi X + \\Pi - X - 1)$.\n$X [ -2\\gamma - (\\gamma-1)\\Pi + (\\gamma-1) ] = -2\\gamma\\Pi + (\\gamma-1)\\Pi - (\\gamma-1)$.\n$X [ -(\\gamma+1) - (\\gamma-1)\\Pi ] = -(\\gamma+1)\\Pi - (\\gamma-1)$.\n$X [ (\\gamma-1)\\Pi + \\gamma+1 ] = (\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1$.\n$X = \\frac{(\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1}{(\\gamma-1)\\Pi + \\gamma+1}$.\nNow substitute this expression for $X$ into the second relation $\\Pi - 1 = \\gamma M_1^2 \\frac{X-1}{X}$:\n$\\Pi - 1 = \\gamma M_1^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{X}\\right) = \\gamma M_1^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\gamma-1)\\Pi + \\gamma+1}{(\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1}\\right)$.\n$\\Pi - 1 = \\gamma M_1^2 \\left(\\frac{[(\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1] - [(\\gamma-1)\\Pi + \\gamma+1]}{(\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1}\\right)$.\n$\\Pi - 1 = \\gamma M_1^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\Pi - 2}{(\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1}\\right) = \\gamma M_1^2 \\frac{2(\\Pi-1)}{(\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1}$.\nFor a non-trivial shock, $\\Pi \\neq 1$, so we can divide by $(\\Pi-1)$:\n$1 = \\frac{2\\gamma M_1^2}{(\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1}$.\nRearranging to solve for $\\Pi = P_2/P_1$:\n$(\\gamma+1)\\Pi + \\gamma-1 = 2\\gamma M_1^2$.\n$(\\gamma+1)\\Pi = 2\\gamma M_1^2 - (\\gamma-1)$.\n$$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{2\\gamma M_1^2 - (\\gamma-1)}{\\gamma+1}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the pressure ratio across the shock.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the upstream Mach number $M_1$.\n\nThe problem states that the plasma behaves as a monatomic ideal gas. For a monatomic gas (with $3$ translational degrees of freedom), the adiabatic index is $\\gamma = 5/3$. This is consistent with our plasma model, which is a mixture of two monatomic ideal gases (ions and electrons). The heat capacity at constant volume for the mixture is $C_V = \\frac{3}{2}k_B$ per particle, and at constant pressure is $C_P = \\frac{5}{2}k_B$ per particle, giving $\\gamma = C_P/C_V = 5/3$.\n\nWe are given the condition that the post-shock pressure is twice the pre-shock pressure, i.e., $P_2/P_1 = 2$.\nWe use the result from Part 2 with $\\gamma = 5/3$ and $P_2/P_1 = 2$:\n$$2 = \\frac{2(\\frac{5}{3}) M_1^2 - (\\frac{5}{3}-1)}{\\frac{5}{3}+1}$$\n$$2 = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} M_1^2 - \\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{8}{3}}$$\nMultiply both sides by $\\frac{8}{3}$:\n$$2 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} M_1^2 - \\frac{2}{3}$$\n$$\\frac{16}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} M_1^2 - \\frac{2}{3}$$\nAdd $\\frac{2}{3}$ to both sides:\n$$\\frac{16}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} M_1^2$$\n$$\\frac{18}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} M_1^2$$\n$$6 = \\frac{10}{3} M_1^2$$\nNow, solve for $M_1^2$:\n$$M_1^2 = 6 \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{9}{5}$$\nFinally, take the square root to find $M_1$. Since Mach number is a non-negative quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$M_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{5}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5}}$$\nTo provide a numerical answer rounded to four significant figures:\n$M_1 = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5}} \\approx 1.341640786...$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $M_1 = 1.342$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.342}$$", "id": "3699269"}, {"introduction": "Fast Ignition (FI) separates the tasks of fuel compression and ignition, using a powerful, short-pulse laser to create a localized hot-spot in the already-compressed fuel.

The momentum flux condition is given as:\n$$P = \\dot{m}'' v_{e}$$\nwhere $P$ is the constant ablation pressure, $\\dot{m}''$ is the areal mass ablation rate (mass per unit area per unit time), and $v_{e}$ is the characteristic exhaust speed of the ablated plasma.\n\nThe mass conservation equation relates the areal mass ablation rate to the geometric recession speed of the solid tip, $v_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, and the solid density of the cone material, $\\rho_{s}$:\n$$\\dot{m}'' = \\rho_{s} v_{\\mathrm{rec}}$$\nBy combining these two equations, we can solve for the recession speed $v_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$P = (\\rho_{s} v_{\\mathrm{rec}}) v_{e}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{rec}} = \\frac{P}{\\rho_{s} v_{e}}$$\nSince the ablation pressure $P$ is assumed to be constant over the total compression time up to peak compression, $T_{\\mathrm{pk}}$, the recession speed $v_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ is also constant during this period.\n\nThe total distance the cone tip recedes, $\\Delta x$, is the product of this constant speed and the duration of ablation:\n$$\\Delta x = v_{\\mathrm{rec}} T_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{P T_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\rho_{s} v_{e}}$$\nThis recession $\\Delta x$ represents an extra distance the shock wave must travel to reach the intended interaction region. The shock propagates at a constant speed $u_{s}$. The resulting time delay, or time shift $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}$, is this additional distance divided by the shock speed:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{u_{s}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta x$, we arrive at the final expression for the shock arrival time shift:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}} = \\frac{P T_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\rho_{s} v_{e} u_{s}}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Maximum Timing Tolerance, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$**\n\nThe areal density $\\rho R(t)$ of the compressed fuel near its peak at time $t_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ is approximated by a parabolic function:\n$$\\rho R(t) \\approx \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa (t - t_{\\mathrm{pk}})^{2}$$\nwhere $\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ is the peak areal density and $\\kappa$ is a constant characterizing the width of the peak.\n\nTo find $\\kappa$, we use the information about the full width at half maximum (FWHM). The FWHM half-width is given as $W$, which means at a time $t = t_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\pm W$, the areal density is half of its peak value: $\\rho R(t_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\pm W) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$.\nSubstituting this condition into the parabolic approximation:\n$$\\rho R(t_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\pm W) = \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa ((t_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\pm W) - t_{\\mathrm{pk}})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\n$$\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa W^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa W^{2}$$\nSolving for $\\kappa$ gives:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{W^{2}}$$\nThe maximum timing tolerance, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$, is defined by the condition that the fractional drop in areal density does not exceed $\\delta$. The limiting case is:\n$$\\rho R(t_{\\mathrm{pk}} + \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}) = (1 - \\delta) \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\nUsing the parabolic model for the left-hand side:\n$$\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2} = (1 - \\delta) \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\n$$\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2} = \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\delta \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\kappa (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2} = \\delta \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression we found for $\\kappa$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{W^{2}}\\right) (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2} = \\delta \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\nThe term $\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ is non-zero and cancels from both sides, which is necessary as its value was not provided.\n$$\\frac{(\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2}}{2W^{2}} = \\delta$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ (and taking the positive root, as a time tolerance is a magnitude), we get the final expression:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}} = W \\sqrt{2 \\delta}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Dimensionless Ratio, $r$**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $r = \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}} / \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$r = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{P T_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\rho_{s} v_{e} u_{s}}\\right)}{\\left(W \\sqrt{2 \\delta}\\right)} = \\frac{P T_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\rho_{s} v_{e} u_{s} W \\sqrt{2 \\delta}}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n- $P = 3.0 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{pk}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\rho_{s} = 1.93 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$\n- $v_{e} = 3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $u_{s} = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $W = 80\\ \\mathrm{ps} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\delta = 0.10$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerator of $r$, which corresponds to $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}$ multiplied by the scale factors in the denominator of $r$. For clarity, we calculate $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}$ and $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ separately.\n\nCalculation of $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}$:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{(1.93 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{5})} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{4}}{1.4475 \\times 10^{15}}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 4.145077 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nCalculation of $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}} = (8.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times \\sqrt{2 \\times 0.10} = (8.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times \\sqrt{0.20}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 3.577708 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}} = \\frac{4.145077 \\times 10^{-11}}{3.577708 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 1.15858$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$r \\approx 1.16$$\nThis result, being greater than $1$, indicates that the timing misalignment caused by cone tip recession is larger than the maximum tolerable misalignment for this target design, suggesting it is a critical issue to be addressed for successful ignition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.16}$$", "id": "3699279"}]}
