A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for a scaling relationship between the stagnation pressure $p_{\\mathrm{stag}}$ of the central hot spot and the parameters of the imploding fuel shell, namely its density $\\rho$ and implosion velocity $v_{\\mathrm{imp}}$. We are instructed to use fundamental principles, specifically Newton's second law applied to a control volume and the concept of momentum flux.\n\nLet us consider a small element of area $A$ on the spherical control surface at the boundary of the hot spot. The fuel shell material flows radially inward toward this surface with velocity $v_{\\mathrm{imp}}$. As this material crosses the boundary and enters the hot spot, it is rapidly decelerated to approximately zero velocity, a process known as stagnation.\n\nWe apply Newton's second law, which states that the net force on a body is equal to the rate of change of its momentum, $F = \\frac{dP}{dt}$. We analyze the flow of mass and momentum into the stagnation region.\n\nIn a time interval $\\Delta t$, a column of fuel of length $v_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\Delta t$ and cross-sectional area $A$ will cross the control surface. The mass of this fluid element is:\n$$ \\Delta m = \\rho \\times (\\text{volume}) = \\rho (A v_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\Delta t) $$\nThe initial momentum of this mass element, directed radially inward, is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{initial}} = (\\Delta m) v_{\\mathrm{imp}} = (\\rho A v_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\Delta t) v_{\\mathrm{imp}} = \\rho A v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 \\Delta t $$\nAfter stagnation within the hot spot, the velocity of this mass element is effectively zero, so its final momentum is $P_{\\mathrm{final}} = 0$.\n\nThe change in momentum of the fluid element is:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_{\\mathrm{final}} - P_{\\mathrm{initial}} = 0 - \\rho A v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 \\Delta t = - \\rho A v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 \\Delta t $$\nAccording to Newton's second law, the force exerted by the hot spot on the incoming fuel to cause this change in momentum over the time $\\Delta t$ is:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{on\\_fuel}} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{- \\rho A v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 \\Delta t}{\\Delta t} = - \\rho A v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is directed radially outward, opposing the inward flow.\n\nBy Newton's third law, the force exerted by the inflowing fuel on the hot spot is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{on\\_hotspot}} = -F_{\\mathrm{on\\_fuel}} = \\rho A v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 $$\nThis force is supported by the pressure of the stagnated gas in the hot spot, $p_{\\mathrm{stag}}$. The force due to this pressure over the area $A$ is $F_{\\mathrm{pressure}} = p_{\\mathrm{stag}} A$. Equating the force from the momentum change to the pressure force gives:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{stag}} A = \\rho A v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 $$\nDividing by the area $A$, we obtain the scaling relationship:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{stag}} = \\rho v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 $$\nThe term $\\rho v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2$ is the momentum flux density of the inflowing material, also known as the ram pressure. The derivation shows that the stagnation pressure is balanced by the ram pressure of the imploding shell.\n\nNext, we address how this scaling implies a lower bound on $v_{\\mathrm{imp}}$. For successful ignition in ICF, the DT fuel in the hot spot must reach a specific set of thermodynamic conditions (temperature and density), which correspond to a minimum required stagnation pressure, let's call it $p_{\\mathrm{stag, target}}$. From the derived relationship, we can write:\n$$ \\rho v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 \\ge p_{\\mathrm{stag, target}} $$\nSolving for the implosion velocity $v_{\\mathrm{imp}}$ gives:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{imp}}^2 \\ge \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{stag, target}}}{\\rho} $$\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{stag, target}}}{\\rho}} $$\nThis inequality shows that for a given fuel shell density $\\rho$ and a required target stagnation pressure $p_{\\mathrm{stag, target}}$, there is a minimum implosion velocity required to achieve ignition conditions. The analytic expression for this minimum velocity is:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{imp, min}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{stag}}}{\\rho}} $$\n\nFinally, we estimate the minimum $v_{\\mathrm{imp}}$ for the given values:\n- Target stagnation pressure: $p_{\\mathrm{stag}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$\n- Shell density: $\\rho = 100\\ \\mathrm{g/cm^3}$\n\nWe must convert these quantities to a consistent set of units, specifically the SI system (meters, kilograms, seconds).\n\nFirst, the pressure: $1\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 1\\ \\mathrm{N/m^2} = 1\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-1} s^{-2}}$ and $1\\ \\mathrm{GPa} = 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{stag}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{GPa} = 300 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 3 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-1} s^{-2}} $$\nNext, the density: $1\\ \\mathrm{g} = 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ and $1\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, so $1\\ \\mathrm{cm^3} = (10^{-2})^3\\ \\mathrm{m^3} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^3}$.\n$$ \\rho = 100\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{cm^3}} = 100 \\times \\frac{10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg}}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^3}} = 100 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3} = 1 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3} $$\nNow we can calculate the minimum implosion velocity:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{imp, min}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{stag}}}{\\rho}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-1} s^{-2}}}{1 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}}} $$\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{imp, min}} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}} = \\sqrt{3} \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{imp, min}} \\approx 1.7320508... \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{imp, min}} \\approx 1.732 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.732 \\times 10^3}$$", "id": "3703417"}, {"introduction": "Once a hot spot is formed, ignition hinges on its ability to trap the energy from fusion-born alpha particles and 'bootstrap' itself to higher temperatures.

We can rearrange it as:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{E} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma $$\nTo find the energy $E$ as a function of $\\Sigma$, we integrate this equation. The alpha particle is born at the center of the hot spot, which corresponds to a traversed path length and areal density of zero. At this point, its energy is the initial energy $E_0$. We integrate from the initial state $(\\Sigma=0, E=E_0)$ to an arbitrary state $(\\Sigma, E)$:\n$$ \\int_{E_0}^{E} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E'}{E'} = \\int_{0}^{\\Sigma} -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma' $$\nSolving the integrals gives:\n$$ [\\ln(E')]_{E_0}^{E} = \\left[-\\frac{\\Sigma'}{\\lambda}\\right]_{0}^{\\Sigma} $$\n$$ \\ln(E) - \\ln(E_0) = -\\frac{\\Sigma}{\\lambda} $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{E}{E_0}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Sigma}{\\lambda} $$\nBy taking the exponential of both sides, we obtain the expression for the energy of the alpha particle after traversing an areal density $\\Sigma$:\n$$ E(\\Sigma) = E_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Sigma}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nThe alpha particle travels radially from the center to the edge of the spherical hot spot.

We begin from fundamental hydrodynamic instability and thermonuclear reaction considerations, and we combine them into a composite yield proxy.\n\nFirst, we model the ablative Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The classical RT growth rate for an interface with acceleration $g(t)$ and wavenumber $k$ under density contrast characterized by Atwood number $A$ is given by\n$$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{cl}}(t) = \\sqrt{A k g(t)}.$$\nAblation at the interface introduces a stabilizing contribution proportional to $k v_a(t)$, resulting in the modified “ablative RT” dispersion relation\n$$\\gamma(t) = \\sqrt{A k g(t)} - k v_a(t).$$\nUnder the assumption that the acceleration $g(t)$ and ablation velocity $v_a(t)$ are approximately constant during the deceleration phase of duration $t_d$, the integrated growth factor becomes\n$$G = \\int_0^{t_d} \\max\\!\\left(\\gamma(t),0\\right)\\, dt = \\max\\!\\left(\\gamma,0\\right)\\, t_d.$$\nPhysically, if $\\gamma \\le 0$, the RT perturbations do not grow and $G=0$; otherwise perturbations grow as $\\exp(G)$ in amplitude. Because perturbation growth can cause mixing of cold shell material into the hotspot, degrading confinement and fusion reactivity, we introduce a mixing penalty that reduces yield as a monotonic function of $G$. To capture this qualitatively, we define\n$$f_{\\mathrm{mix}}(G) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\chi e^G},$$\nwith $\\chi>0$ a dimensionless coefficient controlling the strength of mixing impact. This functional form maps $G=0$ to $f_{\\mathrm{mix}}(0)=1/(1+\\chi)$ (finite residual stabilization loss) and penalizes larger $G$ exponentially, consistent with the multiplicative impact of mixing on performance.\n\nSecond, we model the areal density and burn fraction. For low-entropy compression, lower adiabat $\\alpha$ increases material compressibility. A simplified scaling consistent with polytropic compressibility trends is\n$$\\rho R(\\alpha) = \\rho R_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\alpha}\\right)^p,$$\nwith exponent $p>0$. The burn fraction can be represented in a saturation form\n$$f_b(\\rho R) = 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\rho R}{\\rho R_c}\\right),$$\nwhere $\\rho R_c$ is a characteristic scale; this models the propensity of reactions and self-heating to rise with confinement and saturate as $\\rho R$ becomes large.\n\nThird, we model the hotspot temperature and the fusion reactivity. For a fixed absorbed drive energy, reduced entropy at lower $\\alpha$ is assumed to modestly increase the fraction of energy compressed into the hotspot, which we represent as\n$$T(\\alpha) = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\alpha}\\right)^{q_T},$$\nwith a small exponent $q_T>0$. The Maxwellian-averaged reactivity for Deuterium–Tritium fusion is a monotonically increasing function of $T$ over relevant ranges, with a Gamow-peak behavior. To capture the qualitative $T$-dependence without invoking a detailed parameterization, we use a dimensionless surrogate inspired by the Gamow barrier,\n$$\\mathcal{R}(T) = T^2 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{b}{T^{1/3}}\\right),$$\nwith $b>0$ chosen to reflect an effective barrier height; this function increases with $T$ while penalizing low temperatures super-exponentially, consistent with reduced tunneling at low $T$.\n\nFourth, we connect RT stabilization to adiabat through the ablation velocity. Increasing adiabat $\\alpha$ generally requires a higher “foot” of the laser pulse, raising ablation pressure and ablation velocity. We model\n$$v_a(\\alpha) = v_{a,\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{q_v},$$\nwith $q_v>0$, so that higher $\\alpha$ enhances stabilization via larger $k v_a$.\n\nWith the above components, we define a composite, dimensionless yield proxy\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{raw}}(\\alpha) = f_b\\!\\left(\\rho R(\\alpha)\\right)\\, \\mathcal{R}\\!\\left(T(\\alpha)\\right)\\, f_{\\mathrm{mix}}\\!\\left(G(\\alpha)\\right),$$\nand normalize it to the reference adiabat $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ref}}$:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{norm}}(\\alpha) = \\frac{Y_{\\mathrm{raw}}(\\alpha)}{Y_{\\mathrm{raw}}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ref}})}.$$\nThis normalization removes arbitrary multiplicative constants and focuses on the relative impact of changing $\\alpha$.\n\nAlgorithmic implementation details:\n- Convert the perturbation wavelength from $\\lambda = 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to centimeters: $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cm}} = 300\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and compute $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cm}}$.\n- Use $A=0.5$, $g_0 = 2.0\\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s^2}$, $t_d = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 5.0\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $v_{a,\\mathrm{ref}} = 2.5\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, $\\rho R_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^2}$, $\\rho R_c = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^2}$, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}=5.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, $b=3.0$, $\\chi=0.5$, $p=1.1$, $q_T=0.2$, $q_v=0.6$, and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ref}}=2.5$.\n- For each test case value of $\\alpha$, compute $\\rho R(\\alpha)$, $T(\\alpha)$, $v_a(\\alpha)$, $\\gamma = \\sqrt{A k g_0} - k v_a(\\alpha)$, $G=\\max(\\gamma,0)\\, t_d$, $f_{\\mathrm{mix}}(G)$, $f_b(\\rho R)$, $\\mathcal{R}(T)$, and finally $Y_{\\mathrm{raw}}(\\alpha)$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{norm}}(\\alpha)$.\n- Ensure unit consistency: $k$ in $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $g_0$ in $\\mathrm{cm/s^2}$, $v_a$ in $\\mathrm{cm/s}$, $t_d$ in $\\mathrm{s}$, and $T$ in $\\mathrm{keV}$ as specified.\n- Output the vector of $Y_{\\mathrm{norm}}(\\alpha)$ values for the test suite $\\alpha \\in \\{1.5, 3.0, 2.5, 1.2, 4.0\\}$, rounded to six decimal places, as a single line list in the specified format.\n\nScientific realism and interpretation:\n- Lower $\\alpha$ increases $\\rho R$ through the compressibility scaling, raising $f_b(\\rho R)$ and $T(\\alpha)$, thus increasing $\\mathcal{R}(T)$; however, it reduces $v_a(\\alpha)$, potentially increasing $\\gamma$ and thereby $G$, which decreases $f_{\\mathrm{mix}}$.\n- Higher $\\alpha$ stabilizes RT via ablation ($k v_a$ larger), which can set $\\gamma \\le 0$ and $G=0$, but reduces $\\rho R$ and $T$, which decreases reactivity and burn fraction.\n- The normalized yield quantifies the net effect of these competing trends for the given parameters and conditions.\n\nThe program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered according to the test suite, and rounded to six decimal places, for example $\\left[1.234567,0.987654,1.000000,1.111111,0.777777\\right]$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_normalized_yield(alpha_values):\n    # Constants and units\n    A = 0.5  # Atwood number (dimensionless)\n    lambda_um = 300.0  # micrometers\n    lambda_cm = lambda_um * 1e-4  # convert to cm\n    k = 2.0 * np.pi / lambda_cm  # cm^-1\n\n    g0 = 2.0e15  # cm/s^2\n    td_ns = 5.0  # ns\n    td_s = td_ns * 1e-9  # s\n\n    va_ref = 2.5e6  # cm/s\n    rhoR_ref = 0.9  # g/cm^2\n    rhoR_c = 0.3  # g/cm^2\n    T_ref = 5.0  # keV\n\n    b = 3.0  # dimensionless barrier parameter\n    chi = 0.5  # dimensionless mixing strength\n    p = 1.1\n    q_T = 0.2\n    q_v = 0.6\n    alpha_ref = 2.5\n\n    # Precompute the sqrt(A k g0) term, constant over alpha\n    sqrt_Akg = np.sqrt(A * k * g0)  # s^-1\n\n    def va(alpha):\n        return va_ref * (alpha / alpha_ref) ** q_v\n\n    def rhoR(alpha):\n        return rhoR_ref * (alpha_ref / alpha) ** p\n\n    def T_hot(alpha):\n        return T_ref * (alpha_ref / alpha) ** q_T\n\n    def burn_fraction(rhoR_val):\n        return 1.0 - np.exp(-rhoR_val / rhoR_c)\n\n    def reactivity_surrogate(T_keV):\n        # Dimensionless surrogate: T^2 * exp(-b / T^(1/3))\n        return (T_keV ** 2.0) * np.exp(-b / (T_keV ** (1.0 / 3.0)))\n\n    def growth_factor(alpha):\n        gamma = sqrt_Akg - k * va(alpha)  # s^-1\n        gamma_eff = max(gamma, 0.0)\n        return gamma_eff * td_s  # dimensionless\n\n    def mixing_penalty(G):\n        return 1.0 / (1.0 + chi * np.exp(G))\n\n    def yield_raw(alpha):\n        rR = rhoR(alpha)\n        T = T_hot(alpha)\n        G = growth_factor(alpha)\n        fb = burn_fraction(rR)\n        R = reactivity_surrogate(T)\n        fmix = mixing_penalty(G)\n        return fb * R * fmix\n\n    # Compute reference raw yield at alpha_ref\n    Y_ref = yield_raw(alpha_ref)\n\n    # Compute normalized yields for all cases\n    Y_norm = []\n    for a in alpha_values:\n        Y = yield_raw(a) / Y_ref\n        Y_norm.append(Y)\n\n    return Y_norm\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement (adiabat values).\n    test_cases = [1.5, 3.0, 2.5, 1.2, 4.0]\n\n    results = compute_normalized_yield(test_cases)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format, rounded to six decimal places.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{r:.6f}' for r in results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3703437"}]}
