It is scientifically grounded in the standard fluid theory of plasma waves, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique derivation, and objectively stated using standard terminology. The problem asks for the derivation of the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation for Langmuir waves and the calculation of their group velocity in a specific limit, which is a fundamental exercise in plasma physics.\n\nWe begin by stating the governing equations for a one-dimensional, nonrelativistic electron fluid: the continuity equation, the momentum equation, and Poisson's equation.\n\nThe electron continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n_e}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(n_e v_e) = 0\n$$\n\nThe electron momentum equation, including the electric field force and the pressure gradient force, is:\n$$\nm_e n_e \\left(\\frac{\\partial v_e}{\\partial t} + v_e \\frac{\\partial v_e}{\\partial x}\\right) = -e n_e E - \\frac{\\partial P_e}{\\partial x}\n$$\n\nPoisson's equation for the electric field $E$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} = \\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0}(n_i - n_e)\n$$\nHere, $n_e$, $v_e$, and $P_e$ are the electron number density, fluid velocity, and pressure, respectively. $m_e$ is the electron mass, $-e$ is the electron charge, and $\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The ions are assumed to form a fixed, uniform neutralizing background with density $n_i = n_0$.\n\nWe linearize these equations by considering small perturbations about a stationary, uniform equilibrium. We decompose each variable into an equilibrium part (subscript $0$) and a small, first-order perturbation (subscript $1$):\n$$\nn_e(x, t) = n_0 + n_1(x, t) \\\\\nv_e(x, t) = 0 + v_1(x, t) \\\\\nE(x, t) = 0 + E_1(x, t) \\\\\nP_e(x, t) = P_0 + P_1(x, t)\n$$\nThe equilibrium fluid velocity and electric field are zero. Substituting these into the governing equations and retaining only terms linear in the perturbed quantities (first-order terms), we obtain the linearized equations.\n\nFrom the continuity equation, neglecting the second-order term $n_1 v_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + n_0 \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nFrom the momentum equation, neglecting the second-order convective term $v_1 (\\partial v_1 / \\partial x)$ and the term $n_1 (\\partial v_1 / \\partial t)$:\n$$\nm_e n_0 \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial t} = -e n_0 E_1 - \\frac{\\partial P_1}{\\partial x} \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nFrom Poisson's equation, substituting $n_i = n_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0} n_1 \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nTo close this system of equations, we need a relationship between the pressure perturbation $P_1$ and the density perturbation $n_1$. The problem specifies an adiabatic response, governed by $P_e n_e^{-\\gamma} = \\text{constant}$, where $\\gamma$ is the adiabatic index. Linearizing this relation gives $\\delta P_e / P_0 = \\gamma (\\delta n_e / n_0)$, or $P_1/P_0 = \\gamma n_1/n_0$. With the ideal gas law for the equilibrium state, $P_0 = n_0 k_B T_e$, we have $P_1 = \\gamma n_1 k_B T_e$. For one-dimensional longitudinal compressions and rarefactions as in a Langmuir wave, kinetic theory shows that the appropriate fluid closure corresponds to an adiabatic index $\\gamma = 3$. Thus, the pressure perturbation is $P_1 = 3 n_1 k_B T_e$, and its gradient is $\\partial P_1 / \\partial x = 3 k_B T_e (\\partial n_1 / \\partial x)$.\n\nWe now assume all perturbed quantities have a sinusoidal form proportional to $\\exp(i k x - i \\omega t)$. Under this assumption, the differential operators transform to algebraic operators: $\\partial/\\partial t \\rightarrow -i\\omega$ and $\\partial/\\partial x \\rightarrow ik$. The linearized equations become:\n$$\n-i\\omega n_1 + i k n_0 v_1 = 0 \\implies \\omega n_1 = k n_0 v_1 \\quad (1')\n$$\n$$\n-i\\omega m_e v_1 = -e E_1 - i k (3 k_B T_e) \\frac{n_1}{n_0} \\quad (2')\n$$\n$$\ni k E_1 = -\\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0} n_1 \\quad (3')\n$$\n\nWe can now solve this system to find the dispersion relation $\\omega(k)$. From $(1')$, we express $v_1$ in terms of $n_1$:\n$$\nv_1 = \\frac{\\omega}{k n_0} n_1\n$$\nFrom $(3')$, we express $E_1$ in terms of $n_1$:\n$$\nE_1 = i \\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0 k} n_1\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $v_1$ and $E_1$ into the momentum equation $(2')$:\n$$\n-i\\omega m_e \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{k n_0} n_1\\right) = -e \\left(i \\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0 k} n_1\\right) - i k \\frac{3 k_B T_e}{n_0} n_1\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($n_1 \\ne 0$), we can divide the entire equation by $n_1$ and by $-i$:\n$$\n\\frac{m_e \\omega^2}{k n_0} = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 k} + \\frac{3 k^2 k_B T_e}{k n_0}\n$$\nMultiplying by $k n_0 / m_e$ gives:\n$$\n\\omega^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e} + \\frac{3 k^2 k_B T_e}{m_e}\n$$\nUsing the provided definitions for the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pe}^2 = n_0 e^2 / (\\varepsilon_0 m_e)$, and the electron thermal speed, $v_{te}^2 = k_B T_e / m_e$, we arrive at the dispersion relation for Langmuir waves, known as the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\omega^2(k) = \\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{te}^2\n$$\n\n**1. Phase Velocity, Group Velocity, and the Role of Temperature**\n\nA wave is termed dispersive if its phase velocity depends on the wavenumber. The phase velocity $v_p$ is defined as $v_p = \\omega/k$, and the group velocity $v_g$ is defined as $v_g = \\partial\\omega/\\partial k$. Using our derived dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\omega(k) = \\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{te}^2}\n$$\nThe phase velocity is:\n$$\nv_p = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{te}^2}}{k} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{k^2} + 3 v_{te}^2}\n$$\nThe group velocity is found by differentiating $\\omega(k)$ with respect to $k$:\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial k} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{te}^2}} (6 k v_{te}^2) = \\frac{3 k v_{te}^2}{\\omega}\n$$\nClearly, $v_p \\neq v_g$, and both depend on the wavenumber $k$. This dependence of velocity on $k$ is the definition of a dispersive wave.\n\nThe physical role of finite electron temperature $T_e$ is crucial. The term in the dispersion relation responsible for the $k$-dependence of $\\omega$ is $3 k^2 v_{te}^2$. This term originates from the pressure gradient force, $-\\partial P_e / \\partial x$, in the electron momentum equation. The pressure itself, $P_e$, is a manifestation of the random thermal motion of electrons, and thus is directly proportional to the temperature $T_e$. If the temperature were zero ($T_e=0$), then $v_{te}=0$ and the pressure term would vanish. The dispersion relation would simplify to $\\omega(k) = \\omega_{pe}$. In this \"cold plasma\" case, the frequency is independent of $k$, meaning the group velocity is zero ($v_g=0$). Perturbations do not propagate; they simply oscillate locally at the plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$.\n\nFinite temperature introduces an additional restoring force mechanism: pressure. When a density perturbation occurs (e.g., $n_1 > 0$), the pressure increases locally, and the resulting pressure gradient pushes electrons away, working to restore charge neutrality. This force is stronger for shorter wavelengths (larger $k$) because the spatial gradients are steeper. This $k$-dependent restoring force leads to a $k$-dependent oscillation frequency, which is the essence of dispersion. Therefore, the finite electron temperature, by enabling a pressure response, allows the wave to propagate and is the fundamental reason why Langmuir waves are dispersive and why their phase and group velocities differ.\n\n**2. Group Velocity in the Long-Wavelength Limit**\n\nWe are asked to compute the group velocity $v_g$ to leading order in the small parameter $(k \\lambda_{De})^2$, where $\\lambda_{De} = v_{te}/\\omega_{pe}$. This corresponds to the long-wavelength limit, $k \\lambda_{De} \\ll 1$.\n\nWe start from the exact expression for the group velocity:\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{3 k v_{te}^2}{\\omega}\n$$\nThe dispersion relation can be written as:\n$$\n\\omega(k) = \\sqrt{\\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{te}^2} = \\omega_{pe} \\sqrt{1 + 3 \\frac{k^2 v_{te}^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2}} = \\omega_{pe} \\sqrt{1 + 3 (k \\lambda_{De})^2}\n$$\nIn the limit $k\\lambda_{De} \\ll 1$, we can expand the square root using the binomial approximation $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1 + x/2$ for small $x$. Letting $x = 3 (k \\lambda_{De})^2$, we approximate $\\omega$ as:\n$$\n\\omega(k) \\approx \\omega_{pe} \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{2} (k \\lambda_{De})^2 \\right) = \\omega_{pe} + \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{k^2 v_{te}^2}{\\omega_{pe}}\n$$\nWe can find the leading-order group velocity by differentiating this approximate expression for $\\omega(k)$:\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial k} \\approx \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left(\\omega_{pe} + \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{k^2 v_{te}^2}{\\omega_{pe}}\\right) = \\frac{3 k v_{te}^2}{\\omega_{pe}}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can substitute the leading-order approximation for $\\omega$ (which is $\\omega \\approx \\omega_{pe}$) into the denominator of the exact expression for $v_g$:\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{3 k v_{te}^2}{\\omega} \\approx \\frac{3 k v_{te}^2}{\\omega_{pe}}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. This expression is the leading-order term for the group velocity in an expansion in powers of $k$. The units are $(m^{-1})(m/s)^2 / (s^{-1}) = m/s$, as required for a velocity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3 k v_{te}^{2}}{\\omega_{pe}}}$$", "id": "3706889"}, {"introduction": "Building on the properties of individual waves, we now explore how they couple together in a parametric instability.

The derivation will start from the four foundational equations provided.\n\nThe foundational principles for the three-wave decay process are:\n$1$.

This gives our first key relation involving $\\theta$:\n$$ k_e^2 = k_0^2 + k_s^2 - 2 k_0 k_s \\cos(\\theta) \\quad (*)$$\n\nNext, we use the dispersion relations to express the wavevector magnitudes in terms of frequencies. From the EM wave dispersion relation (3), we can write the magnitudes for the pump wave ($k_0$) and the scattered wave ($k_s$):\n$$ k_0^2 = \\frac{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_p^2}{c^2} \\implies k_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_p^2}}{c} $$\n$$ k_s^2 = \\frac{\\omega_s^2 - \\omega_p^2}{c^2} \\implies k_s = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega_s^2 - \\omega_p^2}}{c} $$\nFrom the Langmuir wave dispersion relation (4), we can express $k_e^2$ in terms of its frequency $\\omega_e$:\n$$ k_e^2 = \\frac{\\omega_e^2 - \\omega_p^2}{3 v_{te}^2} $$\n\nWe now have two expressions for $k_e^2$. Equating them gives:\n$$ k_0^2 + k_s^2 - 2 k_0 k_s \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\omega_e^2 - \\omega_p^2}{3 v_{te}^2} $$\nWe can now solve this equation for $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n$$ 2 k_0 k_s \\cos(\\theta) = k_0^2 + k_s^2 - \\frac{\\omega_e^2 - \\omega_p^2}{3 v_{te}^2} $$\n$$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{k_0^2 + k_s^2}{2 k_0 k_s} - \\frac{\\omega_e^2 - \\omega_p^2}{6 v_{te}^2 k_0 k_s} $$\n\nThe final step is to substitute the expressions for $k_0$, $k_s$, and $\\omega_e$ into this equation.

The final expression for $\\theta$ is the arccosine of this result.\n\nThe problem also asks for an explanation of the role of finite electron temperature.\nThe finite electron temperature, $T_e$, fundamentally modifies the nature of the Langmuir wave. In a cold plasma ($T_e \\to 0$), electron plasma oscillations are non-propagating, meaning their frequency is constant, $\\omega_e = \\omega_p$, regardless of the wavevector $k_e$. The electron pressure is zero, so there is no restoring force to support wave propagation.\nWhen the electron temperature is finite ($T_e > 0$), the electron gas exerts a pressure. This pressure acts as a restoring force, allowing disturbances in the electron density to propagate. This physical effect is mathematically captured by the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation, $\\omega_e^2 = \\omega_p^2 + 3 v_{te}^2 k_e^2$. The thermal correction term, $3 v_{te}^2 k_e^2$, makes the Langmuir wave dispersive, meaning its frequency $\\omega_e$ now depends on its wavevector $k_e$.\n\nThis modification has a direct consequence on the allowed scattering angle $\\theta$. The momentum conservation law, $\\boldsymbol{k}_e = \\boldsymbol{k}_0 - \\boldsymbol{k}_s$, geometrically links $k_e$ to the scattering angle $\\theta$ via the relation $k_e^2 = k_0^2 + k_s^2 - 2k_0 k_s \\cos(\\theta)$. Because the Bohm-Gross relation couples $\\omega_e$ to $k_e$, and energy conservation couples $\\omega_e$ to $\\omega_s$ ($\\omega_s = \\omega_0 - \\omega_e$), the entire system of three-wave resonance becomes coupled to the scattering geometry. The thermal term provides the necessary \"flexibility\" for the system to simultaneously satisfy energy conservation, momentum conservation, and the dispersion relations for all three waves over a continuous range of angles $\\theta$. For a given angle $\\theta$, the geometry determines a specific $k_e$, which in turn determines a specific $\\omega_e$ via the Bohm-Gross relation. This $\\omega_e$ then dictates the required frequency of the scattered light, $\\omega_s$. The final derived formula for $\\theta$ is the mathematical embodiment of satisfying all these constraints simultaneously. Without the thermal term ($v_{te} \\to 0$), the Langmuir wave frequency is rigidly fixed at $\\omega_e=\\omega_p$, which severely constrains the possibility of satisfying the momentum conservation condition for arbitrary angles, making stimulated Raman scattering possible only under much more restrictive conditions.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\theta = \\arccos\\left( \\frac{3 v_{te}^2 (\\omega_0^2 + \\omega_s^2 - 2\\omega_p^2) - c^2 [(\\omega_0 - \\omega_s)^2 - \\omega_p^2]}{6 v_{te}^2 \\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_p^2)(\\omega_s^2 - \\omega_p^2)}} \\right) } $$", "id": "3706871"}, {"introduction": "Parametric instabilities cause plasma waves to grow exponentially, but this growth cannot continue indefinitely.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in plasma physics that requires a rigorous derivation from first principles. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Maximum Electric Field**\n\nWe are seeking a stationary wave solution. It is convenient to transform to a reference frame moving with the wave's phase velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{ph}}$. Let the new coordinate be $\\xi = x - v_{\\mathrm{ph}} t$. In this frame, all quantities are functions of $\\xi$ only. The partial derivatives transform as:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow -v_{\\mathrm{ph}} \\frac{d}{d\\xi}$\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\rightarrow \\frac{d}{d\\xi}$\n\nApplying this transformation to the fluid equations:\n1.  **Continuity Equation**:\n    $-v_{\\mathrm{ph}} \\frac{dn}{d\\xi} + \\frac{d(nv)}{d\\xi} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d}{d\\xi} [n(v - v_{\\mathrm{ph}})] = 0$\n    Integrating with respect to $\\xi$ gives a constant of integration, which represents the conservation of particle flux in the wave frame. We evaluate this constant in the unperturbed region of the plasma, where $v=0$ and $n=n_0$.\n    $n(v - v_{\\mathrm{ph}}) = n_0(0 - v_{\\mathrm{ph}}) = -n_0 v_{\\mathrm{ph}}$\n    Solving for the electron density $n$ as a function of the fluid velocity $v$:\n    $$n = \\frac{n_0 v_{\\mathrm{ph}}}{v_{\\mathrm{ph}} - v}$$\n    This equation reveals that the density $n$ becomes singular as the fluid velocity $v$ approaches the phase velocity $v_{\\mathrm{ph}}$. This singularity defines the wavebreaking condition. Wavebreaking occurs when the fastest electrons in the wave are accelerated to the point where they are \"trapped\" and move with the wave, leading to a pile-up of charge and an infinite density in this cold-fluid model. Therefore, the maximum fluid velocity is limited by the phase velocity: $v_{\\mathrm{max}} = v_{\\mathrm{ph}}$.\n\n2.  **Momentum and Gauss's Law**:\n    The transformed momentum equation is:\n    $(v - v_{\\mathrm{ph}}) \\frac{dv}{d\\xi} = -\\frac{e}{m_e} E$\n    The transformed Gauss's law, with the expression for $n$ substituted, is:\n    $\\frac{dE}{d\\xi} = \\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0}(n_0 - n) = \\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0} \\left( n_0 - \\frac{n_0 v_{\\mathrm{ph}}}{v_{\\mathrm{ph}} - v} \\right) = \\frac{n_0 e}{\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{-v}{v_{\\mathrm{ph}} - v}$\n\n    We now have two coupled first-order differential equations for $E$ and $v$. To find a direct relationship between $E$ and $v$, we can eliminate the spatial variable $\\xi$ by taking the ratio $\\frac{dE}{dv}$:\n    $$\\frac{dE}{dv} = \\frac{dE/d\\xi}{dv/d\\xi} = \\frac{\\frac{n_0 e}{\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{-v}{v_{\\mathrm{ph}} - v}}{(v - v_{\\mathrm{ph}}) \\frac{dv}{d\\xi} / (v - v_{\\mathrm{ph}})} = \\frac{\\frac{n_0 e}{\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{-v}{v_{\\mathrm{ph}} - v}}{-\\frac{e E}{m_e (v - v_{\\mathrm{ph}})}}$$\n    Simplifying this expression:\n    $$\\frac{dE}{dv} = \\frac{n_0 e}{\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{-v}{(v_{\\mathrm{ph}}-v)} \\left( -\\frac{m_e (v-v_{\\mathrm{ph}})}{eE} \\right) = -\\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{v}{E}$$\n    This separates into $E \\, dE = -\\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} v \\, dv$. We integrate this equation:\n    $$\\int E \\, dE = -\\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} \\int v \\, dv$$\n    $$\\frac{1}{2} E^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} v^2 + C$$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration. To determine $C$, we consider a point in the wave where the electric field reaches its maximum amplitude, $E=E_{\\mathrm{max}}$. At this extremum, its derivative $\\frac{dE}{d\\xi}$ must be zero. From Gauss's law, $\\frac{dE}{d\\xi}=0$ implies $v=0$. Thus, the maximum electric field occurs where the fluid velocity is zero.\n    Substituting $E=E_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and $v=0$ into the integrated equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{2} E_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} (0)^2 + C \\implies C = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\mathrm{max}}^2$\n    The relation between $E$ and $v$ is therefore:\n    $E^2 = E_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 - \\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} v^2$\n    This equation shows that the field is zero ($E=0$) when the fluid velocity reaches its maximum magnitude, $|v| = v_{\\mathrm{max}}$. Setting $E=0$, we get:\n    $0 = E_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 - \\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} v_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 \\implies E_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 = \\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} v_{\\mathrm{max}}^2$\n\n    Now we apply the wavebreaking condition derived earlier, $v_{\\mathrm{max}} = v_{\\mathrm{ph}}$. This gives the maximum sustainable electric field amplitude before the wave breaks:\n    $E_{\\mathrm{max}}^2 = \\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} v_{\\mathrm{ph}}^2$\n    Taking the square root for the amplitude:\n    $E_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0}} v_{\\mathrm{ph}}$\n    Using the definition of the plasma frequency, $\\omega_p^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e}$, we can rewrite the term under the square root: $\\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{m_e^2 \\omega_p^2}{e^2}$.\n    Substituting this gives the final analytical expression:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{m_e \\omega_p v_{\\mathrm{ph}}}{e}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now evaluate this expression using the provided data.\n- $n_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{27} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{ph}} = 0.10 \\, c = 0.10 \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}) = 2.99792458 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}$\n- $m_e = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{F \\, m^{-1}}$\n\nIt is computationally more direct to use the form $E_{\\mathrm{max}} = v_{\\mathrm{ph}} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0}}$.\nFirst, calculate the term under the square root:\n$\\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}) (1.0 \\times 10^{27} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}})}{8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{F \\, m^{-1}}} \\approx 1.02882008 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3} \\, F^{-1}}$\nTaking the square root:\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{m_e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.02882008 \\times 10^8} \\approx 1.01430768 \\times 10^4 \\ (\\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3} \\, F^{-1}})^{1/2}$\nNow, multiply by the phase velocity:\n$E_{\\mathrm{max}} = (2.99792458 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}) \\times (1.01430768 \\times 10^4 \\ (\\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3} \\, F^{-1}})^{1/2})$\n$E_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx 3.040810 \\times 10^{11} \\ \\mathrm{V \\, m^{-1}}$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in units of gigavolts per meter ($\\mathrm{GV \\, m^{-1}}$), where $1 \\ \\mathrm{GV} = 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n$E_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{3.040810 \\times 10^{11}}{10^9} \\ \\mathrm{GV \\, m^{-1}} \\approx 304.0810 \\ \\mathrm{GV \\, m^{-1}}$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$E_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx 304 \\ \\mathrm{GV \\, m^{-1}}$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{304}$$", "id": "3706880"}]}
