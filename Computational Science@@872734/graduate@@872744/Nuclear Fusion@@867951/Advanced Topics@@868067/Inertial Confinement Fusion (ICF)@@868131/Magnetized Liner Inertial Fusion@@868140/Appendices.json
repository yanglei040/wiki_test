The simplifying assumptions, while idealizations, are explicitly stated and common in such physics problems to render them analytically tractable. We can therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe derivation for the liner kinetic energy per unit axial length, $K.E.'$, proceeds in several steps, starting from fundamental laws.\n\nFirst, we determine the azimuthal magnetic field, $B_{\\phi}$, generated by the axial current, $I(t)$, flowing through the liner. We apply Ampère's law in its integral form, $\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$, to a circular Amperian loop of radius $r$ concentric with the liner axis. For a loop at the liner's outer surface, $r=R(t)$, the enclosed current is the total liner current $I(t)$. By cylindrical symmetry, the magnetic field is purely azimuthal. Thus, the integral simplifies to $B_{\\phi}(R(t)) \\cdot (2\\pi R(t)) = \\mu_0 I(t)$. Solving for the magnetic field at the liner surface gives:\n$$B_{\\phi}(R(t)) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)}{2\\pi R(t)}$$\nInside the perfectly-conducting liner, the magnetic field is zero.\n\nSecond, we calculate the magnetic pressure, $P_B$, exerted on the liner. The magnetic pressure is the energy density of the magnetic field, given by $P_B = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$. Since the field is non-zero outside the liner and zero inside, there is a net inward pressure on the liner surface equal to the magnetic pressure from the external field:\n$$P_B(t) = \\frac{B_{\\phi}(R(t))^2}{2\\mu_0} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)}{2\\pi R(t)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)^2}{8\\pi^2 R(t)^2}$$\n\nThird, we find the net inward force per unit axial length, $F'$, acting on the liner. This force is the magnetic pressure multiplied by the circumference of the cylinder, $2\\pi R(t)$.\n$$F'(t) = P_B(t) \\cdot 2\\pi R(t) = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)^2}{8\\pi^2 R(t)^2} \\right) (2\\pi R(t)) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)^2}{4\\pi R(t)}$$\nThis is the characteristic compressive force of a Z-pinch. The problem states the critical simplifying assumption that the liner radius remains approximately constant at its initial value, $R_0$, during the current pulse. This is a common approximation for calculating the imparted impulse. Applying this, $R(t) \\approx R_0$, the force per unit length becomes:\n$$F'(t) \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0 I(t)^2}{4\\pi R_0}$$\nSubstituting the given current waveform, $I(t) = I_0 \\sin(\\pi t/\\tau)$:\n$$F'(t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_0^2}{4\\pi R_0} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n\nFourth, we apply Newton's second law to find the liner's velocity. The force per unit length is related to the acceleration, $a(t)$, of the mass per unit length, $m$, by $F'(t) = m a(t)$. The radial acceleration is thus $a(t) = \\frac{F'(t)}{m}$.

The magnetization parameter for a species $s$ is defined as the product of its cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{c,s}$ and its characteristic collisional time $\\tau_s$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}_s = \\omega_{c,s} \\tau_s\n$$\nThe solution will be developed by first expressing all time-dependent plasma parameters in terms of the initial conditions and the cylinder's radius, $R(t)$, and then implementing the step-by-step calculation for the specified time points.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental physical constants and relationships. The elementary charge is $e$, the electron mass is $m_e$, and the proton mass is $m_p$. The ion mass is $m_i = A m_p$, where $A$ is the atomic mass number. The cyclotron frequency for a particle of species $s$ with charge number $Z_s$ in a magnetic field $B$ is given by:\n$$\n\\omega_{c,s} = \\frac{|Z_s| e B}{m_s}\n$$\nFor electrons, $|Z_e|=1$ and $m_s=m_e$. For ions, the charge number is $Z$ and the mass is $m_i$.\n\nThe collisional times are the inverses of the Spitzer collision frequencies. For electrons, the relevant process is electron-ion collisions, so we use $\\tau_e = 1/\\nu_{ei}$. For ions, it is ion-ion collisions, so $\\tau_i = 1/\\nu_{ii}$. The provided formulas are:\n$$\n\\nu_{ei}\\;[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}] = 2.91\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\frac{n_i\\,[\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}]\\,Z\\,\\ln\\Lambda_{ei}}{\\left(T_e\\,[\\mathrm{eV}]\\right)^{3/2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\nu_{ii}\\;[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}] = 4.80\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\frac{Z^4\\,n_i\\,[\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}]\\,\\ln\\Lambda_{ii}}{\\sqrt{A}\\,\\left(T_i\\,[\\mathrm{eV}]\\right)^{3/2}}\n$$\nHere, $n_i$ is the ion number density, $T_e$ and $T_i$ are the electron and ion temperatures, and $\\ln\\Lambda$ terms are the Coulomb logarithms. The plasma is assumed to be quasi-neutral, so the ion density $n_i$ is related to the electron density $n_e$ by $n_e = Z n_i$.\n\nThe implosion model describes the evolution of the plasma state. The radius of the cylindrical plasma, $R(t)$, varies linearly in time from an initial value $R_0$ to a final value $R_f = R_0/C$ over a duration $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$:\n$$\nR(t) = R_0 - (R_0 - R_f)\\frac{t}{t_{\\mathrm{end}}},\\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le t_{\\mathrm{end}}\n$$\nThe evolution of the magnetic field $B(t)$, number density $n(t)$, and temperature $T(t)$ are governed by principles of ideal magnetohydrodynamics and adiabatic compression for an ideal gas with $\\gamma=5/3$.\n-   Magnetic flux conservation: $B(t) A(t) = \\text{const}$, where $A(t) = \\pi R(t)^2$ is the cross-sectional area. This implies $B(t) \\propto R(t)^{-2}$.\n    $$\n    B(t) = B_0\\left(\\frac{R_0}{R(t)}\\right)^2\n    $$\n-   Particle number conservation per unit length: $n(t) A(t) = \\text{const}$, implying $n(t) \\propto R(t)^{-2}$. Since the problem defines $n_0$ as the initial electron density, we have:\n    $$\n    n_e(t) = n_0\\left(\\frac{R_0}{R(t)}\\right)^2\n    $$\n-   Adiabatic compression: $T V^{\\gamma-1} = \\text{const}$, where $V \\propto R^2$ for a cylinder of fixed length. This gives $T (R^2)^{\\gamma-1} = \\text{const}$, so $T \\propto R^{-2(\\gamma-1)}$. For $\\gamma=5/3$, the exponent is $-2(5/3-1) = -4/3$. With the assumption $T_e(t)=T_i(t)=T(t)$:\n    $$\n    T(t) = T_0\\left(\\frac{R_0}{R(t)}\\right)^{4/3}\n    $$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Identify the initial parameters: $R_0, B_0, n_0, T_0, C, t_{\\mathrm{end}}, Z, A, \\ln\\Lambda_{ei}, \\ln\\Lambda_{ii}$.\n2.  Define the three evaluation times: $t_1 = 0$, $t_2 = t_{\\mathrm{end}}/2$, and $t_3 = t_{\\mathrm{end}}$.\n3.  For each evaluation time $t_j$:\n    a. Calculate the radius $R(t_j)$.\n    b. Calculate the time-dependent state variables $B(t_j)$, $n_e(t_j)$, and $T(t_j)$ using the scaling laws above.\n    c. Determine the ion number density $n_i(t_j) = n_e(t_j)/Z$.\n    d. Convert the ion density from SI units ($\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$) to CGS units ($\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$): $n_i\\,[\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}] = n_i\\,[\\mathrm{m}^{-3}] \\times 10^{-6}$.\n    e. Calculate the collision frequencies $\\nu_{ei}(t_j)$ and $\\nu_{ii}(t_j)$ using the provided Spitzer formulas with temperature in eV.\n    f. Compute the collision times $\\tau_e(t_j) = 1/\\nu_{ei}(t_j)$ and $\\tau_i(t_j) = 1/\\nu_{ii}(t_j)$.\n    g. Calculate the cyclotron frequencies $\\omega_{c,e}(t_j)$ and $\\omega_{c,i}(t_j)$ using the magnetic field $B(t_j)$ in SI units.\n    h. Compute the magnetization parameters $\\mathcal{M}_e(t_j) = \\omega_{c,e}(t_j)\\tau_e(t_j)$ and $\\mathcal{M}_i(t_j) = \\omega_{c,i}(t_j)\\tau_i(t_j)$.\n4.  After computing the magnetization parameters at all three time points, find the minimum for each species: $\\min_t \\mathcal{M}_e = \\min(\\mathcal{M}_e(t_1), \\mathcal{M}_e(t_2), \\mathcal{M}_e(t_3))$ and $\\min_t \\mathcal{M}_i = \\min(\\mathcal{M}_i(t_1), \\mathcal{M}_i(t_2), \\mathcal{M}_i(t_3))$.\n5.  Store these two minimum values.\n6.  Repeat for all test cases.\n7.  Finally, format all collected minimum values into a single comma-separated list, with each number expressed in scientific notation rounded to three significant figures, and enclose the list in square brackets.\n\nAn analytical examination of the scaling shows that the collision frequencies $\\nu \\propto n_i/T^{3/2} \\propto (R^{-2})/(R^{-4/3})^{3/2} = R^{-2}/R^{-2} = R^0$, meaning they are constant throughout the implosion in this model. The cyclotron frequencies scale as $\\omega_c \\propto B \\propto R^{-2}$. Therefore, the magnetization parameters scale as $\\mathcal{M} \\propto R^{-2}$. Since $R(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of time, $\\mathcal{M}(t)$ is a monotonically increasing function. The minimum value will thus always occur at $t=0$. The implementation will nevertheless compute the values at all three points as specified to ensure robustness and strict adherence to the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# from scipy import ...\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes electron and ion magnetization parameters along an idealized\n    magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF) trajectory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants in SI units.\n    E_CHARGE = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in Coulombs\n    M_E = 9.1093837015e-31      # Electron mass in kg\n    M_P = 1.67262192369e-27     # Proton mass in kg\n\n    # Prefactors for Spitzer collision frequency formulas (practical units).\n    NU_EI_PREFACTOR = 2.91e-6\n    NU_II_PREFACTOR = 4.80e-8\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: (R0, B0, n0, T0, C, t_end, Z, A, ln_L_ei, ln_L_ii)\n        (0.002, 30.0, 5e20, 800.0, 5.0, 100e-9, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 10.0),\n        # Case B\n        (0.002, 1.0, 5e23, 100.0, 3.0, 60e-9, 1.0, 2.0, 8.0, 8.0),\n        # Case C\n        (0.0015, 0.1, 1e25, 20.0, 2.0, 40e-9, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        R0, B0, n0_e, T0, C, t_end, Z, A, ln_L_ei, ln_L_ii = case\n\n        Rf = R0 / C\n        evaluation_times = [0.0, t_end / 2.0, t_end]\n        \n        m_i = A * M_P\n\n        Me_values = []\n        Mi_values = []\n\n        for t in evaluation_times:\n            # 1.
