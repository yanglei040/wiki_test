A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem is solved in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Photon Shot-Noise Scaling**\n\nThe arrival of photons at the detector is described as a Poisson process. Let $N$ be the mean rate of photon arrivals, with units of photons per second ($\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). A measurement is made over a fixed integration time $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe expected number of photons, or the mean count, $\\mu_C$, detected during the interval $\\Delta t$ is given by the product of the mean rate and the time interval:\n$$\n\\mu_C = N \\Delta t\n$$\nA fundamental property of a Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean. If $C$ is the random variable representing the number of photons counted in the interval $\\Delta t$, then the variance of $C$, denoted $\\sigma_C^2$, is:\n$$\n\\sigma_C^2 = \\mu_C = N \\Delta t\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the photon counts, $\\sigma_C$, is the square root of the variance. This standard deviation represents the intrinsic statistical fluctuation in the count number, which is the photon shot noise.\n$$\n\\sigma_C = \\sqrt{\\sigma_C^2} = \\sqrt{N \\Delta t}\n$$\nThis result shows that the photon shot-noise standard deviation, $\\sigma_C$, scales with the square root of the mean detected photon rate $N$ and the square root of the integration time $\\Delta t$.\n\n**Part 2: Required Mean Photon Rate $N$**\n\nThe signal measured by the diagnostic is the number of photons $C$ collected in the time $\\Delta t$. The mean signal level is therefore proportional to the mean count, $\\mu_C$. The noise in this measurement is the shot noise, quantified by the standard deviation $\\sigma_C$.\n\nThe fractional uncertainty of the intensity measurement due to shot noise is the ratio of the noise (standard deviation) to the mean signal (mean count).\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Uncertainty} = \\frac{\\sigma_C}{\\mu_C}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma_C$ and $\\mu_C$ derived above:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_C}{\\mu_C} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N \\Delta t}}{N \\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N \\Delta t}}\n$$\nThis fractional uncertainty sets the limit on the smallest fractional fluctuation that can be resolved. The problem requires that this shot-noise-limited uncertainty must not exceed the target physical fluctuation level, which is given as $\\delta n_{e} / n_{e} = 0.01$. Let's denote this target level as $\\epsilon$.\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e} = 0.01\n$$\nThe condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N \\Delta t}} \\le \\epsilon\n$$\nTo find the minimum required photon rate $N$ that satisfies this condition, we use the equality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N \\Delta t}} = \\epsilon\n$$\nSolving for $N$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{N \\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\nN \\Delta t = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 \\Delta t}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the time resolution $\\Delta t$ is chosen to satisfy the Nyquist criterion for a measurement bandwidth $B$. The Nyquist sampling theorem states that to faithfully represent a signal with a bandwidth $B$, the sampling frequency must be at least $2B$. This corresponds to a maximum sampling time interval (or integration time) of $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{2B}$.\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta t$ into the equation for $N$:\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2B}\\right)} = \\frac{2B}{\\epsilon^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value for the target fluctuation level, $\\epsilon = 0.01$:\n$$\nN = \\frac{2B}{(0.01)^2} = \\frac{2B}{(10^{-2})^2} = \\frac{2B}{10^{-4}}\n$$\n$$\nN = (2 \\times 10^4) B = 20000 B\n$$\nThis is the required mean photon rate $N$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) as a function of the measurement bandwidth $B$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20000 B}\n$$", "id": "3691839"}, {"introduction": "A real-world detector cannot measure a signal at an exact instant in time; instead, it integrates the incoming photon flux over a short but finite duration, $\\Delta t$.

Rearranging this inequality for $\\tau$, we get $t \\le \\tau \\le t+\\Delta t$. Within this range, $g(t-\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n(a) Definition of Nyquist frequencies and the condition for aliasing.\n\nThe Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem establishes that to avoid loss of information, a signal must be sampled at a rate $f_{s}$ at least twice its highest frequency component, $f_{\\max}$. The critical frequency, which is half the sampling rate, is defined as the Nyquist frequency, denoted by $f_{N}$. It represents the maximum frequency that can be uniquely resolved from the sampled data. Based on this, the Nyquist frequency is:\n$$f_{N} = \\frac{f_{s}}{2}$$\nThe corresponding Nyquist angular frequency, $\\omega_{N}$, is found by using the relation $\\omega = 2\\pi f$:\n$$\\omega_{N} = 2\\pi f_{N} = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{f_{s}}{2}\\right) = \\pi f_{s}$$\nAliasing is the phenomenon where frequency components of the original continuous-time signal that are above the Nyquist frequency appear as lower frequencies in the sampled data, corrupting the signal in the baseband frequency range $[0, f_{N}]$ (or $[0, \\omega_{N}]$ in angular frequency). Given that the signal has a maximum angular frequency of $\\omega_{\\max}$ and there is no anti-aliasing filter to remove higher frequencies before sampling, aliasing will occur if the signal contains frequencies that exceed the Nyquist angular frequency. Therefore, the condition for aliasing is:\n$$\\omega_{\\max} > \\omega_{N}$$\n\n(b) Derivation of the aliased power fraction $R$.\n\nLet the one-sided power spectral density (PSD) of the continuous-time intensity fluctuation signal be denoted by $P(\\omega)$. According to the problem statement, this PSD is constant for angular frequencies between $0$ and $\\omega_{\\max}$, and negligible beyond. Let this constant value be $P_{0}$.\n$$P(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} P_{0} & \\text{if } 0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_{\\max} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\omega > \\omega_{\\max} \\end{cases}$$\nThe total power of the fluctuation signal, $P_{\\text{total}}$, is the integral of the PSD over all frequencies:\n$$P_{\\text{total}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} P(\\omega) \\, d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{\\max}} P_{0} \\, d\\omega = P_{0} \\omega_{\\max}$$\nWhen this signal is sampled at a rate $f_{s}$, the Nyquist angular frequency is $\\omega_{N} = \\pi f_{s}$. The frequency content of the signal is divided into two parts: a baseband part from $0$ to $\\omega_{N}$, and a higher-frequency part from $\\omega_{N}$ to $\\omega_{\\max}$. We assume aliasing occurs, which means $\\omega_{\\max} > \\omega_{N}$.\n\nThe power that is *not* aliased corresponds to the signal content that was originally within the baseband $[0, \\omega_{N}]$. The unaliased power, $P_{\\text{unaliased}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{unaliased}} = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{N}} P(\\omega) \\, d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{N}} P_{0} \\, d\\omega = P_{0} \\omega_{N}$$\nThe power that *is* aliased, $P_{\\text{aliased}}$, corresponds to the signal content at frequencies above $\\omega_{N}$. This power folds back into the baseband $[0, \\omega_{N}]$ upon sampling. The total aliased power is the integral of the PSD from $\\omega_{N}$ up to the maximum frequency $\\omega_{\\max}$:\n$$P_{\\text{aliased}} = \\int_{\\omega_{N}}^{\\omega_{\\max}} P(\\omega) \\, d\\omega = \\int_{\\omega_{N}}^{\\omega_{\\max}} P_{0} \\, d\\omega = P_{0} (\\omega_{\\max} - \\omega_{N})$$\nThe fraction $R$ of the total fluctuation power that is aliased is the ratio of the aliased power to the total power:\n$$R = \\frac{P_{\\text{aliased}}}{P_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{P_{0} (\\omega_{\\max} - \\omega_{N})}{P_{0} \\omega_{\\max}}$$\nThe constant $P_{0}$ cancels, yielding:\n$$R = \\frac{\\omega_{\\max} - \\omega_{N}}{\\omega_{\\max}} = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{N}}{\\omega_{\\max}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_{N}$ from part (a), $\\omega_{N} = \\pi f_{s}$, we obtain the desired expression for $R$ in terms of $\\omega_{\\max}$ and $f_{s}$:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{\\pi f_{s}}{\\omega_{\\max}}$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\omega_{\\max} > \\pi f_{s}$.
