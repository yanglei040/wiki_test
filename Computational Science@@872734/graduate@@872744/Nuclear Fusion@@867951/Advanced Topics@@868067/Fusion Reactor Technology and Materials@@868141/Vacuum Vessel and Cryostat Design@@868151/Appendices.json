An HMSLD, which is a mass spectrometer tuned to the mass-to-charge ratio of helium ions, is connected to the vacuum system such that it samples the gas being pumped from the vessel. The HMSLD must be properly calibrated using a known, certified helium leak standard.\n\n2.  **Enclosure**: The entire exterior of the cryostat vacuum vessel is enclosed in a temporary, gastight shroud or \"hood\" made of a material like polyethylene sheeting.\n\n3.  **Helium Application**: The space between the hood and the cryostat exterior is filled and maintained with a specific, known concentration of helium gas. For a test of this sensitivity, pure helium (a concentration of $100\\%$) is often used to maximize the signal. The helium creates a partial pressure gradient across any leak paths in the vessel wall.\n\n4.  **Detection and Measurement**: The HMSLD continuously monitors the partial pressure of helium inside the vacuum space. If there are any leaks, helium atoms from the hood will flow into the vacuum space and be pumped towards the HMSLD. After a certain time delay (response time), which depends on the vessel volume and pumping speed, the HMSLD will register a steady-state signal corresponding to the total helium leak rate entering the vessel.\n\n5.  **Verification and Acceptance**: The HMSLD provides a reading for the helium leak throughput, typically in units such as $\\text{mbar} \\cdot \\text{L} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$ or $\\text{atm} \\cdot \\text{cm}^3 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$. This measured value, $Q_{\\mathrm{measured}}$, is compared against the maximum allowable leak throughput, $Q_{\\mathrm{leak,max}}$. The acceptance criterion is:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{measured}}  Q_{\\mathrm{leak,max}}$$\nIn standard leak detection units, our calculated limit is:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{leak,max}} = 1.7 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}} = 1.7 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{mbar} \\cdot \\text{L} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nIf the calibrated reading from the HMSLD is below this value, the vessel passes the leak tightness specification. If the reading exceeds this value, it indicates that the total leak rate is unacceptable, and further work to find and repair the leak(s) is necessary.

The vessel-average pressure is $p_{\\text{avg}} = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$. The gauge near the pump in region $1$ measures a pressure that is drastically lower than both the pressure in region $2$ and the vessel-average pressure. This highlights the critical impact of conductance limitations: a local pressure measurement near a strong pump can be highly misleading for the overall vacuum state of a complex, partitioned vessel.\n\nTo infer $p_{\\text{avg}}$ from a measurement of $p_1$ alone, one must know the system parameters $S$, $C$, $G_1$, $V_1$, and $V_2$. The key is to first infer the state of the unmeasured region. The throughput from region $2$ into region $1$ can be inferred from the mass balance in region $1$: $Q_{2 \\to 1} = S p_1 - G_1$. Let's denote this inferred throughput by $Q_{inf}$. Then, one can infer the pressure drop across the duct: $p_2 - p_1 = Q_{inf}/C$. This allows calculation of $p_2$. Finally, $p_{\\text{avg}}$ can be calculated using the volume-weighted average formula.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Using the governing relations for molecular flow and steady-state throughput conservation, the pressure difference between the regions is $p_2 - p_1 = G_2/C$, the pump-side pressure is $p_1 = (G_1 + G_2)/S$, and the vessel-average pressure is $p_{\\text{avg}} = (V_1 p_1 + V_2 p_2)/(V_1 + V_2) \\approx 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$ for the given parameters.**\nThis statement presents the three key results of the steady-state analysis. Our derivation confirms that $p_2 - p_1 = G_2/C$ (from eq. 1), $p_1 = (G_1 + G_2)/S$ (from rearranging $S p_1 = G_1 + G_2$), and the definition of average pressure is correct. Our calculation yielded $p_{\\text{avg}} = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$. Every part of this statement is accurate and derived directly from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because the pump strongly evacuates the vessel, the gauge near the pump reads a value representative of the entire vessel, so $p_{\\text{avg}} \\approx p_1$ even in the presence of a conductance-limited connection to region $2$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While the pump is strong ($S = 1000\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$), its effect is localized by the small conductance of the duct ($C = 10\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$). Our calculations show $p_1 = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}$ and $p_{\\text{avg}} = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$. These values are not approximately equal; they differ by a factor of about $50$. The presence of a conductance-limited connection is precisely why $p_1$ is *not* representative of the average pressure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If only the gauge in region $1$ is available, an unbiased estimate of the vessel-average pressure can be formed as $p_{\\text{avg}} \\approx p_1 + \\dfrac{V_2}{V_1 + V_2}\\,\\dfrac{Q_{12}}{C}$, where $Q_{12}$ is the duct throughput inferred from $p_1$ using $Q_{12} = S p_1 - G_1$; for the given parameters this yields $p_{\\text{avg}} \\approx 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$.**\nThis statement describes the inference procedure. Let's verify the formula for $p_{\\text{avg}}$. Substituting $p_2 = p_1 + Q_{12}/C$ (where $Q_{12}$ is the net throughput $Q_{2 \\to 1}$) into the definition of $p_{\\text{avg}}$:\n$p_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{p_1 V_1 + (p_1 + Q_{12}/C) V_2}{V_1 + V_2} = \\frac{p_1(V_1+V_2) + (Q_{12}/C)V_2}{V_1+V_2} = p_1 + \\frac{V_2}{V_1+V_2} \\frac{Q_{12}}{C}$.\nThe formula is correct. The method for inferring the throughput, $Q_{12} = S p_1 - G_1$, is also correct as derived from the mass balance for region $1$. Finally, let's verify the calculation. From our results, $p_1=0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}$.\n$Q_{12} = (1000\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1})(0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}) - 0.05\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.25 - 0.05 = 0.20\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$p_{\\text{avg}} = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa} + \\frac{120}{80+120} \\frac{0.20\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{10\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa} + (0.6)(0.02\\,\\text{Pa}) = 0.00025 + 0.012 = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$. The calculation is correct. The statement accurately describes a valid inference procedure and gives the correct result.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. A throughput-weighted average $p_w = \\dfrac{S p_1 + C p_1}{S + C}$ equals the vessel-average pressure in molecular flow networks and can be used to infer $p_{\\text{avg}}$ from a single gauge near the pump.**\nThe proposed formula algebraically simplifies to $p_w = \\frac{p_1(S + C)}{S + C} = p_1$. The statement is thus equivalent to claiming $p_{\\text{avg}} = p_1$. As established in the analysis of option B, this is false. The proposed definition of a \"throughput-weighted average\" is not physically meaningful for calculating the vessel-average pressure and is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Placing both gauges in the same compartment eliminates bias caused by conductance limitations, and the vessel-average pressure can be obtained as the arithmetic mean $p_{\\text{avg}} = (p_1 + p_2)/2$ regardless of the volumes and duct conductance.**\nThis statement contains two false claims. First, placing both gauges in one compartment does not eliminate bias; it makes it impossible to measure the pressure in the other compartment, thus preventing a direct calculation of $p_{\\text{avg}}$. Second, the average pressure is the volume-weighted mean, not the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean $(p_1 + p_2)/2$ is only correct if the volumes are equal ($V_1 = V_2$), which is not the case here ($V_1 = 80\\,\\text{m}^3$, $V_2 = 120\\,\\text{m}^3$). The claim that this works \"regardless of the volumes\" is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3724904"}]}
