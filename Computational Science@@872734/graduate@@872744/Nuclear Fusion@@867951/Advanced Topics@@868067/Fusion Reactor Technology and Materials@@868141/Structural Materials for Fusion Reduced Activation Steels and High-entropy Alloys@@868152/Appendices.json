The fundamental idea is that dislocations moving on a slip plane are pinned by these obstacles and must bow out between them under an applied stress.\n\n1.  The force per unit length on a dislocation from an applied resolved shear stress $\\tau$ is $F/L = \\tau b$, where $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector.\n2.
