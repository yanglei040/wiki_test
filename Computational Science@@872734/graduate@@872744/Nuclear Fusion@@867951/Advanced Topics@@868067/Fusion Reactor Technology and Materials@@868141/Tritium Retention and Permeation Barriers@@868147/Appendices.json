It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the steady-state tritium flux through the barrier layer and then determining the effective resistance from its definition.\n\nThe transport of tritium through the homogeneous titanium nitride (TiN) layer is assumed to be a steady-state, one-dimensional diffusion process. According to Fick's first law, the molar flux $J$ is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$ J = -D_b \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nwhere $D_b$ is the diffusivity of tritium in the TiN barrier, and $C(x)$ is the molar concentration of tritium at a position $x$ within the barrier, which spans from $x=0$ to $x=L_b$.\n\nFor steady-state transport through a homogeneous material under isothermal conditions, both $J$ and $D_b$ are constant.

For diatomic gases like tritium ($T_2$), which dissociate into atoms upon dissolution, the concentration of dissolved atomic tritium is proportional to the square root of the partial pressure:\n$$ C = K_{S,b} \\sqrt{p} $$\nwhere $K_{S,b}$ is the Sieverts' constant for tritium in TiN and $p$ is the partial pressure of tritium gas. Applying this relationship at the upstream and downstream interfaces, under the assumption of local equilibrium, gives:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{in}} = K_{S,b} \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{out}} = K_{S,b} \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}} $$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ into the flux equation gives:\n$$ J = \\frac{D_b}{L_b} (K_{S,b} \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - K_{S,b} \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}}) $$\n$$ J = \\frac{D_b K_{S,b}}{L_b} (\\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{in}}} - \\sqrt{p_{\\mathrm{out}}}) $$\n\nThe permeability of a material, $P$, is defined as the product of its diffusivity and its Sieverts' constant: $P = D K_S$.

The problem describes the thermal detrapping of tritium from lattice sites in a material, a well-understood physical process in materials science relevant to nuclear fusion research.

All necessary parameters ($E_b$, $\\nu$, $\\tau$, $k_B$) are provided with physically realistic values and consistent units. The problem is clearly stated and leads to a unique, meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main steps: derivation of the detrapping rate constant, application of the \"significant release\" condition, and calculation of the specific temperature $T_{\\mathrm{sig}}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the temperature dependence of the detrapping rate constant, $k_d(T)$. The problem states that the process follows first-order kinetics. The rate of change of the trapped population, $N(t)$, is therefore described by the rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_d N(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_d$ is the first-order rate constant for detrapping. The elementary escape step is described as a thermally activated process with an attempt frequency $\\nu$ and an energy barrier equal to the binding energy $E_b$. The rate of escape for a single particle is the product of the frequency of attempts to escape, $\\nu$, and the probability of success for each attempt. This success probability is given by the canonical Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-E_b / (k_B T))$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For a first-order process, this microscopic escape rate is identical to the macroscopic rate constant $k_d$. Thus, its temperature dependence is given by the Arrhenius equation:\n$$\nk_d(T) = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nSecond, we analyze the condition for \"significant release\". The first-order rate law is a separable ordinary differential equation. We solve it for an isothermal hold, where $T$ and therefore $k_d$ are constant. Integrating from time $t=0$ with an initial population $N(0)=N_0$ to a time $t$ with population $N(t)$ yields:\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{dN}{N} = \\int_0^t -k_d \\,dt' \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -k_d t\n$$\nThis gives the population decay law:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(-k_d t)\n$$\n\"Significant release\" is defined as the release of one-half of the initially trapped tritium during a hold of duration $\\tau$.
