This quantity is equivalent to the nuclear reaction rate density for the tritium-producing reaction. We will derive this from fundamental principles.\n\nLet us define the fundamental quantities involved:\n1.  The neutron flux, denoted by $\\phi$, is the total number of neutrons passing through a unit area, oriented perpendicular to the direction of neutron motion, per unit time. Its SI units are $\\mathrm{m^{-2}s^{-1}}$.\n2.  The number density of target nuclei, denoted by $N$, is the number of target nuclei per unit volume. Its SI units are $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$. For this problem, the target nucleus is lithium-$6$ ($^{6}\\mathrm{Li}$), and its number density is given as $N_6$.\n3.

We can derive the expression as follows.\n\nConsider a single target nucleus with a microscopic cross-section $\\sigma$. This nucleus is subjected to a uniform neutron flux $\\phi$. The flux can be conceptualized as a stream of particles. The number of incident neutrons that would pass through the effective area $\\sigma$ per unit time is the product of the flux and the area. Thus, the rate of reaction for a single target nucleus is given by the product $\\sigma \\phi$.
