A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe deflection of the beam is governed by the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation, which relates the beam's deflection to the internal bending moment. Let $x$ be the coordinate along the beam's axis, starting from the fixed end at $x=0$, and let $v(x)$ be the vertical deflection at position $x$. The governing differential equation is:\n$$EI \\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = M(x)$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area, and $M(x)$ is the internal bending moment as a function of $x$.\n\nWe adopt a sign convention where downward deflection $v$ is positive. To find the bending moment $M(x)$, we consider a free-body diagram of a beam segment from an arbitrary position $x$ to the free end at $x=L$. Summing moments about the cut section at $x$ gives:\n$$\\sum M_{\\text{at } x} = M(x) - P(L-x) = 0$$\nThis leads to the expression for the bending moment:\n$$M(x) = P(L-x)$$\nSubstituting this into the beam equation:\n$$EI \\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = P(L-x)$$\nTo find the slope of the beam, $\\theta(x) = \\frac{dv}{dx}$, we integrate the equation with respect to $x$:\n$$EI \\frac{dv}{dx} = \\int P(L-x) \\,dx = P \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration.\n\nTo find the deflection curve $v(x)$, we integrate a second time:\n$$EI v(x) = \\int \\left[ P \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) + C_1 \\right] \\,dx = P \\left(\\frac{Lx^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right) + C_1 x + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration.\n\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions at the fixed end ($x=0$).\n1.  **Zero Deflection**: The beam is fixed to the port frame, so it cannot translate at the support. This is expressed as $v(0) = 0$.\n    Applying this condition to the deflection equation:\n    $$EI v(0) = P \\left(\\frac{L(0)^2}{2} - \\frac{0^3}{6}\\right) + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$$\n    This is justified as the boom is rigidly supported by the port frame, which serves as the reference point of zero displacement.\n\n2.  **Zero Slope**: The fixed (or clamped) support prevents any rotation of the beam at that point. This is expressed as $\\frac{dv}{dx}(0) = 0$.\n    Applying this condition to the slope equation:\n    $$EI \\frac{dv}{dx}(0) = P \\left(L(0) - \\frac{0^2}{2}\\right) + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0$$\n    This is justified because a \"fixed\" connection inherently resists moments and thus maintains a zero angle of rotation at the support.\n\nWith $C_1 = 0$ and $C_2 = 0$, the equation for the deflection curve becomes:\n$$v(x) = \\frac{P}{EI} \\left(\\frac{Lx^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right)$$\nThe problem requires the deflection at the free end ($x=L$), which we denote as $\\delta_{\\max}$.\n$$\\delta_{\\max} = v(L) = \\frac{P}{EI} \\left(\\frac{L(L)^2}{2} - \\frac{L^3}{6}\\right) = \\frac{P}{EI} \\left(\\frac{L^3}{2} - \\frac{L^3}{6}\\right)$$\n$$\\delta_{\\max} = \\frac{P}{EI} \\left(\\frac{3L^3 - L^3}{6}\\right) = \\frac{P}{EI} \\frac{2L^3}{6}$$\n$$\\delta_{\\max} = \\frac{PL^3}{3EI}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the end deflection.\n\nThe problem states that this deflection must not exceed the alignment tolerance, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tol}}$. The minimum required Young's modulus, $E_{\\min}$, corresponds to the case where the deflection is exactly equal to the tolerance:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{tol}} = \\frac{PL^3}{3E_{\\min}I}$$\nSolving for $E_{\\min}$:\n$$E_{\\min} = \\frac{PL^3}{3I\\delta_{\\mathrm{tol}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $P = 2.10 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n-   $L = 3.00\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $I = 5.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{4}$\n-   $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tol}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$E_{\\min} = \\frac{(2.10 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{N})(3.00\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{3(5.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{4})(2.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}$$\n$$E_{\\min} = \\frac{(2.10 \\times 10^{4})(27.0)}{3(5.00 \\times 10^{-4})(2.00 \\times 10^{-3})} \\,\\mathrm{\\frac{N \\cdot m^3}{m^4 \\cdot m}}$$\nThe units simplify to $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$, or Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), as expected for Young's modulus.\n$$E_{\\min} = \\frac{5.67 \\times 10^{5}}{3.00 \\times 10^{-6}} \\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n$$E_{\\min} = 1.89 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in GigaPascals ($\\mathrm{GPa}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$E_{\\min} = \\frac{1.89 \\times 10^{11}}{10^9} \\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 189 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nRounding the answer to four significant figures as requested gives $189.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\nThe final value can be expressed in scientific notation as $1.890 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.890 \\times 10^{2}}\n$$", "id": "3716680"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple structural rigidity, the successful installation of fusion components demands sub-millimeter accuracy.
