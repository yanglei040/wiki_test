A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested: determining the location of the $q=1$ surface, deriving the expression for magnetic shear, and evaluating the shear at the $q=1$ surface.\n\n**1. Location of the $q=1$ Surface**\n\nThe rational surface where the safety factor $q$ is equal to $1$ is denoted by the minor radius $r=r_1$. By definition, at this location:\n$$\nq(r_1) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting the given linear profile for $q(r)$:\n$$\nq_0 + \\alpha \\frac{r_1}{r_0} = 1\n$$\nWe can now solve for $r_1$.

This requires $\\frac{1-q_0}{\\alpha}  1$, or $\\alpha  1 - q_0$. This is physically consistent with a plasma current profile that is peaked on-axis.\n\n**2.

The differential of $\\ln q$ is $d(\\ln q) = \\frac{1}{q} dq$, and the differential of $\\ln r$ is $d(\\ln r) = \\frac{1}{r} dr$. Substituting these into the definition gives:\n$$\ns(r) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{q(r)} \\frac{dq}{dr} dr}{\\frac{1}{r} dr}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression, we arrive at the standard formula for magnetic shear in terms of $q(r)$ and its radial derivative $\\frac{dq}{dr}$:\n$$\ns(r) = \\frac{r}{q(r)} \\frac{dq}{dr}\n$$\n\n**3. Evaluation of Magnetic Shear at the $q=1$ Surface**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the radial derivative of the given safety factor profile:\n$$\nq(r) = q_0 + \\alpha \\frac{r}{r_0}\n$$\nThe derivative with respect to $r$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( q_0 + \\alpha \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{r_0}\n$$\nNote that for this linear profile, the derivative $\\frac{dq}{dr}$ is a constant.\n\nNow, we evaluate the shear $s(r)$ at the specific location $r = r_1$.
