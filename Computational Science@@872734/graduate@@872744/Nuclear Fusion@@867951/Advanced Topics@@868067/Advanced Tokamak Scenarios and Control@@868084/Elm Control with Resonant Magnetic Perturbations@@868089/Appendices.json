The solution proceeds by deriving the safety factor profile from the definition of magnetic shear.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Safety Factor Profile\n\nThe magnetic shear $s$ is given as constant across the pedestal, $s = s_{\\mathrm{e}}$. The definition of shear is:\n$$s = \\frac{r}{q} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}r}$$\nSetting $s = s_{\\mathrm{e}}$ gives a first-order ordinary differential equation for the safety factor $q(r)$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{e}} = \\frac{r}{q} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}r}$$\nThis equation is separable. We rearrange it to isolate the variables $q$ and $r$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{q} = s_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{r}$$\nTo find the function $q(r)$, we integrate this expression from the plasma edge boundary, $r=a$, to an arbitrary radius $r$ within the pedestal.\n$$\\int_{q(a)}^{q(r)} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q'}{q'} = \\int_{a}^{r} s_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r'}{r'}$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\\left[ \\ln |q'| \\right]_{q(a)}^{q(r)} = s_{\\mathrm{e}} \\left[ \\ln |r'| \\right]_{a}^{r}$$\nSince $q$ and $r$ are positive definite, the absolute values can be dropped.\n$$\\ln(q(r)) - \\ln(q(a)) = s_{\\mathrm{e}} (\\ln(r) - \\ln(a))$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{q(r)}{q(a)}\\right) = s_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\right)$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the relationship for $q(r)$:\n$$\\frac{q(r)}{q(a)} = \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$\nSubstituting the boundary condition $q(a) = q_{\\mathrm{a}}$, we get the explicit safety factor profile:\n$$q(r) = q_{\\mathrm{a}} \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Range of q-values in the Pedestal\n\nThe pedestal is defined over the radial interval $r \\in [0.9\\,a, a]$. Since the shear $s_{\\mathrm{e}} = 1.5$ is positive, $q(r)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $r$. Therefore, the minimum value of $q$ occurs at the inner boundary $r = 0.9\\,a$ and the maximum value occurs at the outer boundary $r=a$.\n\nThe value of $q$ at the outer boundary is given:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{max}} = q(a) = q_{\\mathrm{a}} = 4.1$$\nThe value of $q$ at the inner boundary is:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{min}} = q(0.9\\,a) = q_{\\mathrm{a}} \\left(\\frac{0.9\\,a}{a}\\right)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}} = q_{\\mathrm{a}} (0.9)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values $q_{\\mathrm{a}} = 4.1$ and $s_{\\mathrm{e}} = 1.5$:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{min}} = 4.1 \\times (0.9)^{1.5} \\approx 4.1 \\times 0.853815 \\approx 3.5006$$\nThe range of safety factor values in the pedestal is approximately $q \\in [3.5006, 4.1]$.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of Resonant Integer Mode Numbers\n\nA rational surface for an RMP with toroidal mode number $n=3$ exists if $q(r) = m/n = m/3$ for some integer $m$.
