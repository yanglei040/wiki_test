The objectives are clearly defined and formalizable using fundamental principles of thermodynamics and plasma physics. Therefore, we may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the fractional loss of internal energy, $\\frac{\\Delta W}{W_{\\text{ped}}}$, based on three fundamental relations: the ideal-gas internal energy density, the ideal-gas equation of state, and the adiabatic process relation.\n\nLet the initial state of the pedestal plasma prior to the ELM burst be characterized by a uniform pressure $p_0$, a uniform total particle number density $n_0$, and a uniform temperature $T_0$. The plasma is confined within an effective pedestal volume $V_{\\text{ped}}$.\n\nThe total internal energy of an ideal gas is given by $W = \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1} N k_B T$, where $N$ is the total number of particles and $\\gamma$ is the adiabatic index. For a three-dimensional monatomic gas, the number of degrees of freedom is $3$, and the adiabatic index is $\\gamma = \\frac{3+2}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}$. Thus, the internal energy is $W = \\frac{1}{(5/3)-1} N k_B T = \\frac{3}{2} N k_B T$.\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, $p V = N k_B T$, we can express the total internal energy in terms of pressure. The total internal energy within the pedestal volume $V_{\\text{ped}}$ is:\n$$W_{\\text{ped}} = \\frac{3}{2} N_0 k_B T_0$$\nwhere $N_0 = n_0 V_{\\text{ped}}$ is the initial total number of particles. Substituting the ideal gas law for the initial state, $p_0 V_{\\text{ped}} = N_0 k_B T_0$, we can write the initial internal energy as:\n$$W_{\\text{ped}} = \\frac{3}{2} p_0 V_{\\text{ped}}$$\nThis relation directly connects the macroscopic quantities of total internal energy and pressure, based on the assumption of a monatomic ideal gas and spatial uniformity.\n\nDuring the ELM burst, a fraction $f$ of the pedestal particles is expelled. The number of particles remaining in the volume $V_{\\text{ped}}$ is $N_1 = (1-f)N_0$. The final state after the burst is characterized by a new uniform pressure $p_1$, a new uniform particle density $n_1$, and a new uniform temperature $T_1$.

For an adiabatic process, the quantity $p V^\\gamma$ is constant for a fixed amount of gas undergoing a volume change. An equivalent formulation, more suitable for a situation where particle density changes within a fixed volume, is $p n^{-\\gamma} = \\text{constant}$. This relation describes the state change of the remaining plasma.

The fractional pressure drop is defined as:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_0} = \\frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0}$$\nFrom our derivation above, we established that:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta W}{W_{\\text{ped}}} = \\frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0}$$\nTherefore, it is immediately evident that within the assumptions of this model:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta W}{W_{\\text{ped}}} = \\frac{\\Delta p}{p_0}$$\nThe reason these two fractional quantities are equal is a direct consequence of the assumption that the internal energy density, $w$, is directly and universally proportional to the thermodynamic pressure, $p$. For the specified monatomic ideal gas, $w = \\frac{3}{2}p$. Because the total internal energy $W$ is the integral of the uniform energy density over the fixed volume $V_{\\text{ped}}$, it follows that $W = w V_{\\text{ped}} = (\\frac{3}{2}p) V_{\\text{ped}}$. Thus, $W$ is directly proportional to $p$. When forming the dimensionless ratio of the change in energy to the initial energy, the constants of proportionality ($\\frac{3}{2}$ and $V_{\\text{ped}}$) cancel, leaving a ratio that is identical to the fractional change in pressure. This equality would hold for any process where the internal energy could be expressed as $W(t) = C p(t) V$ for some constant $C$ and fixed volume $V$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 - (1-f)^{\\frac{5}{3}}} $$", "id": "3696298"}]}
