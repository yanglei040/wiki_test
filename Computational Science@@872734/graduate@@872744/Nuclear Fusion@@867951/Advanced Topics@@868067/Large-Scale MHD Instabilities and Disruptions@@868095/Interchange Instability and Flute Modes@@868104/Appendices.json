The equilibrium pressure $p$ is a function of the major radius $R$ only, i.e., $p=p(R)$, with a constant gradient $\\frac{dp}{dR}$.

The magnetic field line curvature vector is approximated as:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\approx -\\frac{1}{R}\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{R} $$\n\nWe substitute these expressions into the integrand.

The geometry is a torus of minor radius $a$ and major radius $R_0$. We use toroidal coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\varphi)$, where $r$ is the minor radius, $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle, and $\\varphi$ is the toroidal angle. The relationships to cylindrical coordinates $(R, Z, \\varphi)$ are $R = R_0 + r \\cos\\theta$ and $Z = r \\sin\\theta$. The volume element $dV$ in these toroidal coordinates is given by the Jacobian multiplied by $dr\\,d\\theta\\,d\\varphi$. The Jacobian is $R = R_0 + r \\cos\\theta$. Thus,\n$$ dV = (R_0 + r \\cos\\theta) \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi = R \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\varphi $$\nNote that the problem statement asks for a simplification using $R \\approx R_0$ for the volume element.

This condition is physically expected for a magnetically confined plasma, where the pressure decreases outwards from the center.\n\nNow we analyze the sign of $\\delta W_{\\kappa p}$ under this condition. The expression is:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\kappa p} = 4\\pi^2 \\left( \\frac{dp}{dR} \\right) \\left( \\int_0^a \\xi_r^2(r) \\, dr \\right) $$\nThe term $4\\pi^2$ is positive. The integral $\\int_0^a \\xi_r^2(r) \\, dr$ is also positive for any non-trivial displacement $\\xi_r(r)$, since its integrand $\\xi_r^2(r)$ is non-negative. Therefore, the sign of $\\delta W_{\\kappa p}$ is determined entirely by the sign of $\\frac{dp}{dR}$.\nIn the bad curvature region, where $\\frac{dp}{dR}  0$, the contribution to the potential energy is:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\kappa p}  0 $$\nA negative $\\delta W$ signifies that the plasma is unstable to the given perturbation. This confirms that the combination of \"bad\" curvature and a negative pressure gradient drives the flute instability, which is the expected physical result.\n\nThe final answer requested is the closed-form analytic expression for this contribution to $\\delta W$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi^2 \\frac{dp}{dR} \\int_0^a \\xi_r^2(r) \\, dr}\n$$", "id": "3704021"}, {"introduction": "While the energy principle tells us whether a system is unstable, a dispersion relation reveals the dynamics of that instability, including its growth rate.
