Trapped particles satisfy $|\\xi| < \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}}$.\n\nNext, we compute the fraction of trapped particles, $f_{t}$. The problem specifies a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution that is isotropic in velocity orientation. For an isotropic velocity distribution, the probability of a particle having a pitch-angle cosine $\\xi = v_{\\parallel}/v$ in the interval $[\\xi, \\xi+d\\xi]$ is uniform. In three-dimensional velocity space, the solid angle element is $d\\Omega = \\sin\\alpha d\\alpha d\\phi$, where $\\alpha$ is the pitch angle. Since $\\xi = \\cos\\alpha$, we have $d\\xi = -\\sin\\alpha d\\alpha$. Integrating over the gyrophase angle $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, the velocity space volume element corresponding to a range $d\\xi$ is proportional to $d\\xi$. The total range of $\\xi$ is from $-1$ to $1$. Normalizing the probability distribution over this range $[-1, 1]$ gives the probability density function $p(\\xi) = 1/2$.\n\nThe trapped fraction $f_{t}$ is the integral of this probability density over the region of pitch-angle cosine corresponding to trapped particles, which is $|\\xi| < \\xi_{c}$.\n$$f_{t} = \\int_{-\\xi_{c}}^{\\xi_{c}} p(\\xi) d\\xi = \\int_{-\\xi_{c}}^{\\xi_{c}} \\frac{1}{2} d\\xi = \\frac{1}{2} [\\xi]_{-\\xi_{c}}^{\\xi_{c}} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\xi_{c} - (-\\xi_{c})) = \\xi_{c}$$\nSo, the trapped fraction is:\n$$f_{t} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}}$$\nThe passing fraction, $f_{p}$, is the complement of the trapped fraction:\n$$f_{p} = 1 - f_{t} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1 + \\epsilon}}$$\n\nQualitatively, the passing fraction $f_{p}$ depends on the inverse aspect ratio $\\epsilon$ as follows. As $\\epsilon = r/R_{0}$ increases, the torus becomes \"fatter\" and the magnetic field variation along a field line, $(B_{\\max}-B_{\\min})/B_{0} \\approx 2\\epsilon$, increases. This creates a deeper magnetic well, which is more effective at trapping particles. Consequently, the trapped fraction $f_{t}$ increases with $\\epsilon$, and the passing fraction $f_{p}$ decreases. In the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$ (a cylinder), $B$ is uniform, so $f_{t} \\to 0$ and $f_{p} \\to 1$, meaning all particles are passing. In the theoretical limit $\\epsilon \\to 1$, the magnetic mirror ratio $B_{\\max}/B_{\\min} \\to \\infty$, so $f_{t} \\to 1$ and $f_{p} \\to 0$, meaning almost all particles become trapped.\n\nIf the pitch-angle distribution were not isotropic, the passing fraction would change. For example, tangential neutral beam injection creates a surplus of particles with $|\\xi| \\approx 1$. Since these values of $\\xi$ are in the passing region ($|\\xi| \\ge \\xi_c$), such a distribution would lead to a higher passing fraction $f_{p}$ compared to the isotropic case. Conversely, perpendicular heating methods like ICRH tend to increase particle energy in the direction perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$, pushing particles towards $|\\xi| \\approx 0$. Since this is the center of the trapped region, this would lead to a lower passing fraction $f_{p}$ and a higher trapped fraction $f_{t}$.

Bounce Frequency of Deeply Trapped Particles**\n\nFirst, we determine the bounce frequency, $\\omega_b$, for deeply trapped particles. These are particles confined to a small poloidal angle range $|\\theta| \\ll 1$ around the minimum magnetic field at $\\theta=0$. The conservation of energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ (constant in the absence of electric fields) and magnetic moment $\\mu = mv_{\\perp}^2 / (2B)$ allows us to express the parallel velocity $v_{\\parallel}$ as:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^2 = v^2 - v_{\\perp}^2 = v^2 - \\frac{2\\mu B}{m}$$\nAt the bounce points, $\\theta=\\pm\\theta_b$, the parallel velocity is zero, $v_{\\parallel}=0$. This gives the condition $E = \\mu B(\\theta_b)$, or $v^2 = 2\\mu B(\\theta_b)/m$. Substituting this back, we find:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^2 = v^2\\left(1 - \\frac{B(\\theta)}{B(\\theta_b)}\\right)$$\nUsing the given magnetic field model, $B(\\theta) \\approx B_0(1-\\epsilon\\cos\\theta)$:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^2 \\approx v^2\\left(1 - \\frac{1-\\epsilon\\cos\\theta}{1-\\epsilon\\cos\\theta_b}\\right) = v^2\\frac{\\epsilon(\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\theta_b)}{1-\\epsilon\\cos\\theta_b}$$\nFor deeply trapped particles, the bounce angle $\\theta_b$ is small.

Collisional Detrapping near Bounce Points**\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation based on the effects localized near the bounce points. This refers to the competition between the deterministic mirror force acceleration and the stochastic collisional scattering. A trapped particle can be detrapped if collisions perturb its orbit significantly, particularly near the bounce points where the parallel velocity is low and the orbit is most sensitive.\n\nThe character of the particle's motion is determined by the interplay between the bounce dynamics and collisions. Bounce motion is oscillatory, while collisions introduce a diffusive, random-walk character. Detrapping occurs when the bounce motion's phase coherence is lost due to collisions. This happens when the time scale for phase randomization, $\\tau^*$, becomes comparable to or shorter than the bounce period, $\\tau_b \\sim 1/\\omega_b$.\n\nThe phase randomization time $\\tau^*$ can be derived by considering the equation for parallel motion, $dv_{\\parallel}/dt = a_{\\parallel} + F_{stoch}/m$, where $a_{\\parallel}$ is the mirror force acceleration and $F_{stoch}$ is the stochastic force from collisions. Coherence is lost when the deterministic change in velocity, $a_{\\parallel}\\tau^*$, is overcome by the random collisional change, $(\\Delta v_{\\parallel})_{coll}$. The mean square collisional change is $(\\Delta v_{\\parallel})_{coll}^2 \\sim D_{vv}\\tau^*$, where $D_{vv}$ is the velocity-space diffusion coefficient, which scales as $\\nu v^2$. The critical condition is when the deterministic and stochastic velocity changes are of the same order: $(a_{\\parallel}\\tau^*)^2 \\sim D_{vv}\\tau^*$. This yields the phase randomization time:\n$$\\tau^* \\sim \\frac{D_{vv}}{a_{\\parallel}^2} \\sim \\frac{\\nu v^2}{a_{\\parallel}^2}$$\nThe critical condition for detrapping within a bounce is $\\omega_b \\tau^* \\sim 1$. Substituting the expressions for $\\omega_b$ and $\\tau^*$ gives the critical collision frequency $\\nu_c$:\n$$\\nu_c \\sim \\frac{a_{\\parallel}^2}{\\omega_b v^2}$$\nTo evaluate this, we need a characteristic value for the parallel acceleration $a_{\\parallel}$. The acceleration due to the mirror force is $a_{\\parallel} = -\\frac{\\mu}{m}\\nabla_{\\parallel}B$. Using $dl_{\\parallel} \\approx qR d\\theta$ and $\\mu \\approx mv^2/(2B_0)$ for deeply trapped particles:\n$$a_{\\parallel} = -\\frac{\\mu}{m}\\frac{1}{qR}\\frac{dB}{d\\theta} \\approx -\\frac{v^2}{2B_0}\\frac{1}{qR}(B_0\\epsilon\\sin\\theta) = -\\frac{v^2\\epsilon\\sin\\theta}{2qR}$$\nThe acceleration is position-dependent. The argument focuses on the bounce region, but to find a single threshold frequency, we must select a characteristic acceleration for trapped particles. The maximum acceleration occurs at $\\theta=\\pi/2$ where $\\sin\\theta=1$. While deeply trapped particles do not reach this angle, this value represents the characteristic magnitude of the mirror force in the trapping region. Using this as the characteristic acceleration:\n$$|a_{\\parallel}|_{char} \\sim \\frac{v^2\\epsilon}{qR}$$\nSubstituting the characteristic acceleration and the bounce frequency scaling into the expression for $\\nu_c$:\n$$\\nu_c \\sim \\frac{\\left(\\frac{v^2\\epsilon}{qR}\\right)^2}{\\left(\\frac{v\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{qR}\\right)v^2} = \\frac{\\frac{v^4\\epsilon^2}{(qR)^2}}{\\frac{v^3\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{qR}} = \\frac{v^4\\epsilon^2}{(qR)^2} \\frac{qR}{v^3\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{v\\epsilon^{2-1/2}}{qR}$$\n$$\\nu_c \\sim \\frac{v\\epsilon^{3/2}}{qR}$$\nThis is the threshold collision frequency at which a particle is collisionally scattered out of its trapped trajectory within a single bounce period, marking the transition from well-defined bounce orbits (banana regime) to a regime where orbits are not completed (plateau regime).\n\n**3. Impact on Neoclassical Transport Scaling**\n\nCrossing this threshold profoundly modifies the contribution of trapped particles to neoclassical transport.\n\n-   **Low Collisionality (Banana Regime: $\\nu < \\nu_c$):** In this regime, trapped particles complete many bounce orbits before a collision significantly alters their trajectory. The combination of vertical guiding-center drifts (from $\\nabla B$ and curvature) and the poloidal projection of the orbit results in the well-known \"banana\" shaped orbits, which have a characteristic radial width $\\Delta r_b \\propto q\\rho_L/\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, where $\\rho_L$ is the Larmor radius. Transport occurs via a random walk where particles are collisionally scattered from one banana orbit to another. The effective collision frequency for this process is $\\nu_{eff} \\sim \\nu/\\epsilon$, and the diffusion coefficient scales as $D \\sim f_t (\\Delta r_b)^2 \\nu_{eff} \\propto \\sqrt{\\epsilon} (q^2\\rho_L^2/\\epsilon) (\\nu/\\epsilon)$, which simplifies to:\n    $$D_{banana} \\propto \\frac{q^2}{\\epsilon^{3/2}}\\rho_L^2\\nu$$\n    Thus, in the banana regime, the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the collision frequency.\n\n-   **High Collisionality (Plateau Regime: $\\nu > \\nu_c$):** When the collision frequency exceeds the critical value, particles are scattered out of their orbits before they can complete a bounce. The coherent banana structure does not form. Transport is now governed by a resonant process where the particle's transit frequency matches the periodicity of the magnetic field structure. In this regime, the details of the collisions become less important, and the resulting transport is surprisingly independent of the collision frequency. The diffusion coefficient in this plateau regime scales as:\n    $$D_{plateau} \\propto \\frac{q v_{th}\\rho_L^2}{R}$$\n    where $v_{th}$ is the thermal velocity.\n\nIn summary, as the collision frequency $\\nu$ increases and crosses the threshold $\\nu_c$, the trapped-particle contribution to neoclassical diffusion transitions from being proportional to $\\nu$ (banana regime) to being independent of $\\nu$ (plateau regime). This transition from $D \\propto \\nu$ to $D \\propto \\nu^0$ is a hallmark of neoclassical theory in toroidal geometry.\n\nThe final answer is the derived expression for the critical collision frequency $\\nu_c$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{v \\epsilon^{3/2}}{qR}}$$", "id": "3710948"}]}
