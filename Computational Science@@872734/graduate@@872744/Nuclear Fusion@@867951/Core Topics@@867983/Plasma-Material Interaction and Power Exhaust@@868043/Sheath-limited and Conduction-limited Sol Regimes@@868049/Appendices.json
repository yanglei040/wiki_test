A solution will be formulated based on the provided information.\n\n**Problem Solution**\n\nThe problem addresses steady-state, one-dimensional heat transport along a magnetic field line. The fundamental principle is energy conservation. With negligible volumetric sources and sinks, the divergence of the heat flux is zero. In one dimension, this implies that the parallel heat flux is constant along the coordinate $s$. The problem statement correctly identifies this consequence, stating $q_{\\parallel}$ is spatially constant.\n\nThe relationship between heat flux and the temperature gradient is given by Fourier's law of heat conduction. In one dimension, the heat flux along the $s$-direction is given by:\n$$ q_{s}(s) = -\\kappa_e(T) \\frac{dT}{ds} $$\nHeat flows from the hot upstream region ($s=L_{\\parallel}$, $T=T_u$) to the cold target region ($s=0$, $T=T_t$). Therefore, heat flows in the negative $s$-direction, and the heat flux component $q_{s}(s)$ is negative. Let $q_{\\parallel}$ represent the magnitude of the heat flux, which is a positive constant. Thus, $q_{s}(s) = -q_{\\parallel}$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$ -q_{\\parallel} = -\\kappa_e(T) \\frac{dT}{ds} $$\nSubstituting the given Spitzer–Härm conductivity, $\\kappa_{e}(T) = \\kappa_{0} T^{5/2}$, we obtain:\n$$ q_{\\parallel} = \\kappa_{0} T^{5/2} \\frac{dT}{ds} $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for the temperature profile $T(s)$. We can solve this equation by separation of variables:\n$$ \\kappa_{0} T^{5/2} dT = q_{\\parallel} ds $$\nTo find the relationship between the upstream and target temperatures, we integrate this equation along the entire length of the field line. The integration limits are from the target ($s=0$, $T=T_t$) to the upstream location ($s=L_{\\parallel}$, $T=T_u$):\n$$ \\int_{T_{t}}^{T_{u}} \\kappa_{0} T^{5/2} dT = \\int_{0}^{L_{\\parallel}} q_{\\parallel} ds $$\nSince $\\kappa_{0}$ and $q_{\\parallel}$ are constants, they can be moved outside the integrals:\n$$ \\kappa_{0} \\int_{T_{t}}^{T_{u}} T^{5/2} dT = q_{\\parallel} \\int_{0}^{L_{\\parallel}} ds $$\nPerforming the integrations yields:\n$$ \\kappa_{0} \\left[ \\frac{T^{7/2}}{7/2} \\right]_{T_{t}}^{T_{u}} = q_{\\parallel} [s]_{0}^{L_{\\parallel}} $$\n$$ \\frac{2}{7} \\kappa_{0} (T_{u}^{7/2} - T_{t}^{7/2}) = q_{\\parallel} L_{\\parallel} $$\nThis equation provides the general relationship between the temperatures, heat flux, and connection length for Spitzer–Härm conduction.\n\nThe problem specifies that the SOL is in a conduction-limited regime, which is characterized by the condition $T_t \\ll T_u$. Under this assumption, the term $T_t^{7/2}$ is negligible compared to $T_u^{7/2}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{2}{7} \\kappa_{0} T_{u}^{7/2} \\approx q_{\\parallel} L_{\\parallel} $$\nThis is the characteristic relationship for the conduction-limited SOL. To derive the scaling of $T_u$ with $L_{\\parallel}$, we rearrange this expression to solve for $T_u$:\n$$ T_{u}^{7/2} \\approx \\frac{7 q_{\\parallel} L_{\\parallel}}{2 \\kappa_{0}} $$\n$$ T_{u} \\approx \\left( \\frac{7 q_{\\parallel} L_{\\parallel}}{2 \\kappa_{0}} \\right)^{2/7} $$\nThe problem states that $q_{\\parallel}$ is held fixed. The quantities $7$, $2$, and $\\kappa_{0}$ are constants. Therefore, the scaling relationship between the upstream temperature $T_u$ and the connection length $L_{\\parallel}$ is:\n$$ T_{u} \\propto L_{\\parallel}^{2/7} $$\nThis completes the first part of the objective.\n\nFor the second part, we must find the multiplicative change in $T_u$ when $L_{\\parallel}$ is doubled. Let the initial state be denoted by $(T_{u}^{(\\text{old})}, L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{old})})$ and the new state by $(T_{u}^{(\\text{new})}, L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{new})})$. We are given $L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{new})} = 2 L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{old})}$.\n\nUsing the derived scaling law, we can write the ratio of the new upstream temperature to the old upstream temperature:\n$$ \\frac{T_{u}^{(\\text{new})}}{T_{u}^{(\\text{old})}} = \\frac{ \\left( C \\cdot L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{new})} \\right)^{2/7} }{ \\left( C \\cdot L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{old})} \\right)^{2/7} } $$\nwhere $C = \\frac{7 q_{\\parallel}}{2 \\kappa_{0}}$ is the constant of proportionality. The constant $C$ cancels out:\n$$ \\frac{T_{u}^{(\\text{new})}}{T_{u}^{(\\text{old})}} = \\left( \\frac{L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{new})}}{L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{old})}} \\right)^{2/7} $$\nSubstituting $L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{new})} = 2 L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{old})}$ into the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{T_{u}^{(\\text{new})}}{T_{u}^{(\\text{old})}} = \\left( \\frac{2 L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{old})}}{L_{\\parallel}^{(\\text{old})}} \\right)^{2/7} = 2^{2/7} $$\nThus, doubling the connection length while keeping the parallel heat flux constant results in the upstream temperature increasing by a factor of $2^{2/7}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2^{2/7}}\n$$", "id": "3718554"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical derivation to practical interpretation, this exercise simulates the work of an experimental physicist.

A solution will be derived.\n\n## DERIVATION\n\nThe problem requires an analysis based on the Two-Point Model of the SOL, which connects upstream (midplane, subscript '$u$') and downstream (target, subscript '$t$') plasma parameters using conservation laws. We consider a simple fluid model for a quasineutral plasma ($n_e = n_i = n$) with $T_e = T_i = T$.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n1.  **Particle Flux at the Target:** Ions enter the magnetic sheath at the target with the ion sound speed, $c_s$, according to the Bohm criterion. The ion flux is thus $\\Gamma_{i,t} = n_t c_{s,t}$, where $c_{s,t} = \\sqrt{k_B(T_{e,t} + T_{i,t})/m_i}$. For $T_e=T_i=T$, this simplifies to $c_{s,t} \\propto \\sqrt{T_t}$.\n2.  **Momentum Balance:** In the absence of momentum loss, plasma pressure is conserved along the flux tube, leading to $p_u \\approx 2p_t$. Here, $p = n(T_e+T_i) = 2nT$. The factor of $2$ arises from the pressure drop required to accelerate the flow to Mach $1$ at the sheath entrance. Thus, $2n_u T_u \\approx 2(2n_t T_t)$, or $n_u T_u \\approx 2 n_t T_t$. As divertor neutral pressure increases, ion-neutral collisions (primarily charge-exchange) cause a significant momentum loss, leading to a drop in target pressure, $p_t$.\n3.  **Energy Balance:** The parallel heat flux, $q_{||}$, flows from upstream to the target. At the target, this heat is transmitted through the sheath: $q_{||,t} = \\gamma \\Gamma_{i,t} T_{e,t}$, where $\\gamma \\approx 7-8$ is the sheath heat transmission coefficient. The mode of parallel transport dictates the relationship between $q_{||}$, $T_{e,u}$, and $T_{e,t}$. Volumetric processes like radiation and charge-exchange sourced by neutrals can remove energy along the field line, such that $q_{||,u} > q_{||,t}$.\n\n**SOL Regimes:**\n\n**1. Sheath-Limited Regime:**\nThis regime occurs at low upstream density and high temperature. Parallel electron thermal conductivity is very high, making the temperature nearly uniform along the field line: $T_{e,u} \\approx T_{e,t}$. The heat flux is limited by the sheath's ability to transmit energy.\n$q_{||} \\approx q_{||,t} = \\gamma \\Gamma_{i,t} T_{e,t} \\approx \\gamma \\Gamma_{i,t} T_{e,u}$.\nThe target ion flux $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ is thus directly proportional to the heat flux entering the SOL, $\\Gamma_{i,t} \\propto q_{||} / T_{e,u}$.\n\n**2. Conduction-Limited Regime:**\nThis regime occurs at higher upstream density and lower temperature. A significant temperature gradient develops along the field line, $T_{e,u} \\gg T_{e,t}$. Heat transport is dominated by electron thermal conduction, governed by the Spitzer-Härm law: $q_{||} = -\\kappa_e \\nabla_{||} T_e = -\\kappa_{0e} T_e^{5/2} \\frac{dT_e}{ds}$.\nIntegrating along the field line of length $L$ (and ignoring volumetric power losses for a moment) gives:\n$q_{||} L = \\int_{T_{e,t}}^{T_{e,u}} \\kappa_{0e} T_e^{5/2} dT_e = \\frac{2}{7}\\kappa_{0e} (T_{e,u}^{7/2} - T_{e,t}^{7/2})$.\nSince $T_{e,u} \\gg T_{e,t}$, we get the key scaling law for this regime:\n$$q_{||} \\approx \\frac{2}{7} \\frac{\\kappa_{0e}}{L} T_{e,u}^{7/2}$$\nThe heat flux is a very strong function of the upstream temperature and is independent of target parameters.\n\n**Analysis of the Observation:**\nThe experiment involves increasing the divertor neutral pressure. This enhances local atomic physics processes in the divertor:\n- **Ionization:** Increases the local plasma density $n_t$ (this is called \"high recycling\").\n- **Radiation and Charge-Exchange:** Create volumetric sinks for energy and momentum, respectively.\n\nThis process drives the SOL from the low-recycling, sheath-limited regime towards the high-recycling, conduction-limited regime. Therefore, the observed change corresponds to a **transition from sheath-limited to conduction-limited**.\n\nLet's verify if this transition is consistent with the observations: $T_{e,u}$ is constant, and $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ decreases significantly.\n1.  As the system enters the conduction-limited regime, volumetric energy losses and the increased particle flux requiring heating cause the divertor plasma to cool dramatically. This leads to a large drop in $T_{e,t}$, so $T_{e,t} \\ll T_{e,u}$, consistent with the definition of this regime.\n2.  The drop in $T_{e,t}$ causes a reduction in the sound speed, $c_{s,t} \\propto \\sqrt{T_{e,t}}$.\n3.  Simultaneously, intense ion-neutral collisions cause significant parallel momentum loss. This breaks the simple pressure balance, leading to a substantial drop in the target plasma pressure $p_t$.\n4.  The target ion flux is $\\Gamma_{i,t} = n_t c_{s,t}$. From pressure balance, $p_t \\approx 2 n_t T_t$, so $n_t \\propto p_t/T_t$. Substituting this gives $\\Gamma_{i,t} \\propto (p_t/T_t)\\sqrt{T_t} = p_t/\\sqrt{T_t}$.\n5.  A significant decrease in $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ is a hallmark of \"detachment\", which is an advanced stage of the conduction-limited regime. In this stage, the momentum loss is so severe that the drop in $p_t$ overwhelms any other change, causing the particle flux to the target to \"roll over\" and decrease. The observation of a significant decrease in $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ is the primary signature of this pressure loss.\n\nThe observation that $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ decreases while $T_{e,u}$ is held constant is therefore perfectly explained by a transition into a high-recycling, conduction-limited regime where volumetric momentum losses become dominant.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The system transitions from sheath-limited to conduction-limited, because enhanced parallel electron thermal conduction and volumetric losses cool the divertor, reducing $T_{e,t}$ and the target sound speed and pressure, thereby lowering $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ despite nearly unchanged $T_{e,u}$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the direction of the transition (sheath-limited to conduction-limited). It correctly identifies the key physical mechanisms: volumetric losses cause cooling (reduction in $T_{e,t}$ and sound speed). Crucially, it includes the reduction of target pressure, which is the direct cause of the drop in $\\Gamma_{i,t}$. The phrasing \"enhanced parallel electron thermal conduction\" correctly conveys that conduction becomes the dominant transport mechanism over the developed temperature gradient. This option provides a complete and accurate physical picture consistent with the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The system transitions from conduction-limited to sheath-limited, because the sheath heat transmission limits $q_{||}$, which reduces $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ while keeping $T_{e,u}$ constant.**\nThis option proposes the wrong direction for the transition. An increase in divertor neutral pressure drives the system from sheath-limited to conduction-limited, not the other way around. The reasoning provided applies to the sheath-limited regime but does not explain the observed decrease in flux in the context of increasing neutral pressure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No regime change can be inferred; a decrease in $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ with $T_{e,u}$ constant is equally consistent with either regime and primarily reflects changes in cross-field sources.**\nThis is incorrect. The relationship between upstream and downstream parameters, and thus the response to changing conditions, is fundamentally different in the two regimes. A strong decrease in target flux while the upstream temperature is maintained is a powerful signature of entering the high-recycling, momentum-loss-dominated, conduction-limited regime. Attributing this primarily to cross-field sources ignores the critical role of parallel transport physics, which is the subject of the question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The plasma must be fully detached; the observed decrease in $\\Gamma_{i,t}$ implies detachment irrespective of upstream conditions, so regime identification is not possible.**\nWhile the observed flux drop is indeed the signature of plasma detachment, this option contains two major flaws. First, detachment is not independent of upstream conditions; it occurs when upstream density and power fall within a specific range for a given geometry and impurity content. Second, detachment is not a separate state that precludes regime identification. On the contrary, detachment is an extreme form of the **conduction-limited regime**, where volumetric losses become dominant. Identifying the onset of detachment *is* an identification of the operating regime.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3718575"}, {"introduction": "This final practice brings together the key concepts of SOL transport into a unified, computational framework.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the standard one-dimensional, steady-state two-point model. All necessary parameters, constants, and governing equations are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present. We will now proceed with a full derivation and solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to relate the upstream plasma temperature, $T_u$, to the temperature at the divertor target, $T_t$, under a constant parallel heat flux, $q$. This is governed by two fundamental principles: heat conduction along the magnetic field line and heat transmission through the sheath at the target.\n\nFirst, we consider the electron parallel heat conduction, which is described by the Spitzer-Härm law:\n$$q = -\\kappa(T) \\frac{dT}{ds}$$\nwhere $q$ is the heat flux in $\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^2$, $s$ is the coordinate along the magnetic field line from the upstream point ($s=0$) to the target ($s=L_{\\parallel}$), and $T$ is the electron temperature in electronvolts (eV). The thermal conductivity $\\kappa(T)$ is given by $\\kappa(T) = \\kappa_0 T^{5/2}$, with $\\kappa_0$ being a constant. Since the problem states that volumetric energy sources and sinks are negligible, the heat flux $q$ is constant along $s$.\n\nWe can integrate this equation to find the temperature profile. We separate variables and integrate over the length of the SOL, $L_{\\parallel}$:\n$$q \\int_{0}^{L_{\\parallel}} ds = -\\kappa_0 \\int_{T(0)}^{T(L_{\\parallel})} T^{5/2} dT$$\nWith $T_u = T(0)$ and $T_t = T(L_{\\parallel})$, the integration yields:\n$$q L_{\\parallel} = -\\kappa_0 \\left[ \\frac{2}{7} T^{7/2} \\right]_{T_u}^{T_t} = -\\frac{2}{7} \\kappa_0 (T_t^{7/2} - T_u^{7/2})$$\nRearranging this gives the fundamental relation of the two-point model:\n$$T_u^{7/2} = T_t^{7/2} + \\frac{7 q L_{\\parallel}}{2 \\kappa_0}$$\nThis equation connects the upstream and target temperatures via the heat flux, connection length, and conductivity.\n\nSecond, we apply the boundary condition at the divertor target ($s=L_{\\parallel}$), which is determined by sheath physics. The heat flux entering the sheath is given by:\n$$q = \\gamma n_e k_B T_t c_s$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the sheath heat transmission factor, $n_e$ is the electron density, and $c_s$ is the ion sound speed, $c_s = \\sqrt{k_B T_t / m_i}$. The term $k_B T_t$ represents thermal energy and must be in Joules. Since our temperature $T$ is in eV, we must use the conversion $k_B T_t \\rightarrow e T_t$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. Substituting this and the expression for $c_s$:\n$$q = \\gamma n_e (e T_t) \\sqrt{\\frac{e T_t}{m_i}} = \\gamma n_e e^{3/2} m_i^{-1/2} T_t^{3/2}$$\nFor convenience, let's define the sheath coefficient $C_{sh} = \\gamma n_e e^{3/2} m_i^{-1/2}$, so the sheath boundary condition simplifies to:\n$$q = C_{sh} T_t^{3/2}$$\n\nWith these two equations, we have a closed system. For a given incoming heat flux $q_{\\mathrm{in}}$, we set $q = q_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and solve for the temperatures.\n1.  From the sheath equation, we solve for the target temperature $T_t$:\n    $$T_t = \\left( \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{in}}}{C_{sh}} \\right)^{2/3}$$\n2.  With $T_t$ and $q_{\\mathrm{in}}$ known, we use the integrated conduction equation to find the upstream temperature $T_u$:\n    $$T_u = \\left( T_t^{7/2} + \\frac{7 q_{\\mathrm{in}} L_{\\parallel}}{2 \\kappa_0} \\right)^{2/7}$$\n\nThe problem requires defining a dimensionless regime parameter, $D$, to distinguish between sheath-limited and conduction-limited regimes. We look at the equation for $T_u^{7/2}$:\n$$T_u^{7/2} = T_t^{7/2} + \\frac{7 q L_{\\parallel}}{2 \\kappa_0}$$\nThe term $T_t^{7/2}$ represents the temperature scale set by the sheath boundary condition. The term $\\frac{7 q L_{\\parallel}}{2 \\kappa_0}$ represents the temperature drop due to conduction over the distance $L_{\\parallel}$. A natural dimensionless parameter is the ratio of these two terms:\n$$D = \\frac{7 q L_{\\parallel} / (2 \\kappa_0)}{T_t^{7/2}} = \\frac{7 q L_{\\parallel}}{2 \\kappa_0 T_t^{7/2}}$$\nThe physical interpretation of $D$ is as follows:\n-   If conduction is very efficient (large $\\kappa_0$) or the connection length $L_{\\parallel}$ is short, the temperature profile is nearly flat ($T_u \\approx T_t$). In this case, the conduction term is small compared to the sheath term, so $D \\ll 1$. This is the **sheath-limited regime**.\n-   If conduction is poor (small $\\kappa_0$) or the connection length $L_{\\parallel}$ is long, a large temperature gradient is required to drive the heat flux, resulting in $T_u \\gg T_t$. The conduction term dominates, so $D \\gg 1$. This is the **conduction-limited regime**.\n\nFor algorithmic classification, a threshold must be chosen. The natural choice is $D=1$, which represents the point where the conduction-induced temperature drop is of the same order as the target temperature itself (in this $T^{7/2}$ scaling). At $D=1$, $T_u^{7/2} = 2T_t^{7/2}$, which means $T_u = 2^{2/7}T_t \\approx 1.22 T_t$. This represents a reasonable transition point between a \"flat\" and a \"steep\" temperature profile. We therefore set the classification rule:\n-   Regime is sheath-limited (return $0$) if $D < 1$.\n-   Regime is conduction-limited (return $1$) if $D \\ge 1$.\n\nThe numerical implementation will follow this logic. For each test case $(\\kappa_0, L_{\\parallel}, q_{\\mathrm{in}})$, we will calculate $C_{sh}$ using the provided constants, then compute $T_t$, $T_u$, and $D$ using the derived formulas, and finally classify the regime.
