The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution based on fundamental principles of plasma physics.\n\nWe begin with Poisson's equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ to the net charge density $\\rho$:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0} $$\nHere, $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. The problem concerns the plasma sheath adjacent to a flat wall, so we can consider a one-dimensional system where the spatial coordinate $x$ is the distance from the wall. Poisson's equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_0} $$\nThe net charge density $\\rho(x)$ is determined by the densities of the charged species. For an electron-ion plasma with singly charged ions, $\\rho(x) = e(n_i(x) - n_e(x))$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, and $n_i(x)$ and $n_e(x)$ are the ion and electron number densities, respectively. Poisson's equation is thus:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0}(n_i(x) - n_e(x)) $$\nThe problem states several assumptions. Far from the wall, in the bulk plasma, quasi-neutrality holds, meaning $n_i \\approx n_e$. We denote this unperturbed density as $n_0$. The problem provides the edge electron density $n_e = 5 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, which we take as $n_0$. The ions are assumed to be approximately stationary over the timescale of electron motion. For the purpose of establishing the shielding length scale, we can approximate the ion density throughout the region of interest as constant and equal to its bulk value, $n_i(x) \\approx n_0$.\n\nThe electrons, being much lighter and more mobile, are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium and respond to the local electrostatic potential. Their density distribution follows the Boltzmann relation:\n$$ n_e(x) = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{e(\\phi(x) - \\phi_0)}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_e$ is the electron temperature, and $\\phi_0$ is the potential in the unperturbed plasma where the density is $n_0$. By setting the reference potential in the bulk plasma to zero, $\\phi_0 = 0$, the relation simplifies to:\n$$ n_e(x) = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_i(x)$ and $n_e(x)$ into Poisson's equation gives the Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T_e}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T_e}\\right) - 1\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the characteristic screening length, which is derived under the assumption of small potential variations, i.e., $|e\\phi(x)| \\ll k_B T_e$. In this limit, we can linearize the exponential term using the Taylor expansion $\\exp(y) \\approx 1 + y$ for small $y$:\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T_e}\\right) - 1 \\approx \\left(1 + \\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T_e}\\right) - 1 = \\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T_e} $$\nThe linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} \\approx \\frac{e n_0}{\\varepsilon_0} \\left(\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T_e}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}\\right) \\phi(x) $$\nThis is a homogeneous second-order linear differential equation of the form $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\lambda_D^2}$. The constant $\\lambda_D$ is the characteristic length scale over which the potential perturbation decays. By comparing the two forms, we identify this characteristic screening length as the electron Debye length, $\\lambda_D$:\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_0 e^2}} $$\nThis derivation identifies $\\lambda_D$ as the fundamental scale at which quasi-neutrality breaks down due to electrostatic effects.\n\nNext, we compute the value of $\\lambda_D$ for the given parameters.\nThe given values are:\nElectron density $n_e = n_0 = 5 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$.\nElectron temperature $T_e = 30 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe term $k_B T_e$ represents the thermal energy of the electrons in Joules. Since the temperature is given in electron volts (eV), which is a unit of energy, we can directly convert it to Joules by multiplying by the magnitude of the elementary charge, $e$.\n$k_B T_e = (30 \\, \\mathrm{eV}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{J/eV}) = 4.8065299 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\mathrm{J}$.\nThe required physical constants in SI units are:\nVacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0 \\approx 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{F \\cdot m^{-1}}$.\nElementary charge $e \\approx 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the Debye length:\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{(8.854187... \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (4.8065299... \\times 10^{-18})}{(5 \\times 10^{19}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2}} $$\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.25484... \\times 10^{-29}}{1.28348... \\times 10^{-18}}} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{3.31514... \\times 10^{-11}} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\lambda_D \\approx 5.75773... \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the electron Debye length is $5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFinally, we must estimate the minimum sheath thickness. The problem defines this as the shortest distance from the wall over which the relative charge imbalance $|n_i - n_e|/n_e$ becomes of order unity. The plasma sheath is, by definition, a region of significant charge separation, and its thickness is fundamentally determined by the Debye length. While a fully developed sheath is typically several Debye lengths thick (e.g., $5\\lambda_D$ to $10\\lambda_D$), the *characteristic length scale* that governs the transition from the quasi-neutral bulk plasma to the non-neutral sheath region is precisely the Debye length. The problem's framing, particularly the restriction to a model with stationary ions, precludes a more complex calculation (e.g., using a Child-Langmuir law or the Bohm criterion, which requires ion dynamics). Within the physical model established by the problem's premises, the only relevant length scale that emerges is $\\lambda_D$. Therefore, the most direct and physically grounded estimate for the minimum thickness or fundamental scale of the sheath is the Debye length itself.\n\nThus, we estimate the minimum sheath thickness to be equal to the calculated Debye length.\nEstimated minimum sheath thickness $\\approx \\lambda_D \\approx 5.76 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5.76 \\times 10^{-6} & 5.76 \\times 10^{-6}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3714563"}, {"introduction": "In the absence of an external circuit, a material wall in contact with plasma will naturally charge to a \"floating\" potential where ion and electron currents perfectly balance.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires determining three quantities: the electron flux suppression factor, the deuteron impact speed, and the deuteron impact energy. We will address each in order.\n\n**1. Electron Flux Suppression Factor**\n\nThe electrons are assumed to have a Maxwellian velocity distribution. In the main plasma, far from the wall, the electron density is $n_p$. The wall is biased negatively with respect to the plasma, creating a repulsive potential barrier of magnitude $\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_p - \\phi_w = 100\\,\\mathrm{V}$.

Deuteron Impact Speed at the Wall**\n\nThe deuterons are assumed to be cold ($T_i \\ll T_e$) and are accelerated in the presheath. They enter the sheath at the sheath edge with the minimum speed required for a stable sheath, which is the ion sound speed, $v_s$, according to the Bohm criterion. For cold ions ($T_i=0$), this speed is:\n$$v_{se} = v_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_D}}$$\nHere, $v_{se}$ is the deuteron speed at the sheath edge, $k_B T_e$ is the electron thermal energy, and $m_D$ is the deuteron mass.
