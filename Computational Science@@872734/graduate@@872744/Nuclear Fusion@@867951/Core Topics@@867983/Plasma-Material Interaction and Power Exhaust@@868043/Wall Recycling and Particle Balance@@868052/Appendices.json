If $\\tau_0$ is measured in seconds, then $d\\tau_p/dR$ is also in seconds.\n\nThird, we analyze the sign and magnitude of this derivative.\nThe sign of $d\\tau_{p}/dR$ is determined by the signs of the parameters in the expression.

If we assume $\\eta > 0$ (i.e., some recycled neutrals are ionized and fuel the core), then $d\\tau_{p}/dR > 0$. The positive sign signifies that $\\tau_{p}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $R$. This is physically intuitive: increasing the recycling coefficient means more particles are returned to the plasma, which reduces the net loss rate and thus increases the effective particle confinement time.\n\nThe magnitude of the derivative, $\\frac{\\eta \\tau_{0}}{(1 - \\eta R)^{2}}$, provides critical insight into plasma density control. The key feature is the $(1 - \\eta R)^{2}$ term in the denominator. As the operating point approaches a high-recycling regime, where the product $\\eta R$ approaches $1$, the denominator becomes very small. This causes the derivative $d\\tau_{p}/dR$ to become very large. In an operational context, this implies that in a high-recycling plasma, the effective particle confinement time becomes extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in the recycling coefficient $R$. A minuscule change in wall conditions (e.g., surface temperature or saturation) could slightly alter $R$ and trigger a large, potentially uncontrolled, increase in $\\tau_{p}$, leading to a rapid and significant rise in plasma density. This high sensitivity makes density control challenging in high-recycling regimes.
