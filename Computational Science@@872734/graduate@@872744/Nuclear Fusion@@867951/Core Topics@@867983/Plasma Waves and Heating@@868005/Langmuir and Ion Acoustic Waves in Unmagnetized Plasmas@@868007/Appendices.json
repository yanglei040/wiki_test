We linearize these equations for small perturbations about a stationary ($v_0=0$), uniform ($n_0$, $T_e$) equilibrium. Let the perturbations in density, velocity, and electric field be $n_1$, $v_1$, and $E_1$, respectively. The perturbations are assumed to have the form $\\exp(i k x - i \\omega t)$, so the differential operators become $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\to -i\\omega$ and $\\nabla \\to ik$.\n\n1.  **Continuity Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (n v) = 0$.\n    Linearizing gives $\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + n_0 \\nabla \\cdot v_1 = 0$, which transforms to:\n    $$-i\\omega n_1 + ik n_0 v_1 = 0 \\implies \\omega n_1 = k n_0 v_1 \\quad (1)$$\n\n2.  **Momentum Equation:** $m_{e} n (\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + v \\cdot \\nabla v) = -e n E - \\nabla P$.\n    The pressure perturbation $P_1$ is related to the density perturbation $n_1$ by the adiabatic law, $P=Cn^{\\gamma_e}$. To first order, $P_1 = (\\frac{dP}{dn})_{n_0} n_1 = \\gamma_e \\frac{P_0}{n_0} n_1$. Using the ideal gas law for the equilibrium state, $P_0 = n_0 k_B T_e$, we get $P_1 = \\gamma_e k_B T_e n_1$.\n    The linearized momentum equation is $m_{e} n_0 \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial t} = -e n_0 E_1 - \\nabla P_1$. This transforms to:\n    $$-i\\omega m_e n_0 v_1 = -e n_0 E_1 - ik(\\gamma_e k_B T_e n_1) \\quad (2)$$\n\n3.  **Gauss's Law:** $\\nabla \\cdot E = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{-e(n - n_0)}{\\varepsilon_0}$.\n    For the perturbation field $E_1$, this is $\\nabla \\cdot E_1 = - \\frac{e n_1}{\\varepsilon_0}$. This transforms to:\n    $$ik E_1 = -\\frac{e n_1}{\\varepsilon_0} \\quad (3)$$\n\nWe now solve this system of three algebraic equations for $n_1$, $v_1$, and $E_1$. From $(3)$, we express $E_1$ in terms of $n_1$: $E_1 = i \\frac{e}{\\varepsilon_0 k} n_1$. From $(1)$, we express $v_1$ in terms of $n_1$: $v_1 = \\frac{\\omega}{k n_0} n_1$.

For a physical quantity $A(t) = \\text{Re}\\{ A_1 e^{-i\\omega t} \\}$, the time average of its square is $\\langle A(t)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} |A_1|^2$. Let the complex amplitude of the electric field be $E_1$, which we can take as a real value $E_{max}$ by choice of phase.\n\n1.  **Time-Averaged Electric Field Energy Density:**\n    The energy density of the electric field is $U_E = \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_0 E^2$.\n    $$\\langle U_E \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_0 \\langle E(x,t)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} |E_1|^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\varepsilon_0 E_{max}^2$$\n\n2.  **Time-Averaged Electron Kinetic Energy Density:**\n    The kinetic energy density of the coherent fluid motion is $U_{KE} = \\frac{1}{2}n_0 m_e v_1^2$.\n    We need to relate the velocity amplitude $|v_1|$ to the electric field amplitude $|E_1|$. From the dispersion relation derivation, we have several relationships. Let's use $(1)$ and $(3)$:\n    $v_1 = \\frac{\\omega}{k} \\frac{n_1}{n_0}$ and $n_1 = i \\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k}{e} E_1$.\n    Substituting $n_1$ into the expression for $v_1$:\n    $$v_1 = \\frac{\\omega}{k n_0} \\left(i \\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k}{e} E_1\\right) = i \\frac{\\varepsilon_0 \\omega}{n_0 e} E_1$$\n    The magnitude is $|v_1| = \\frac{\\varepsilon_0 \\omega}{n_0 e} |E_1|$.\n    The time-averaged kinetic energy density is:\n    $$\\langle U_{KE} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}n_0 m_e \\langle v_1(x,t)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} n_0 m_e \\left(\\frac{1}{2} |v_1|^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} n_0 m_e \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 \\omega}{n_0 e} E_{max}\\right)^2$$\n    $$\\langle U_{KE} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} n_0 m_e \\frac{\\varepsilon_0^2 \\omega^2}{n_0^2 e^2} E_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{m_e \\varepsilon_0^2 \\omega^2}{n_0 e^2} E_{max}^2$$\n    Using $\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e} \\implies \\frac{n_0 e^2}{m_e} = \\varepsilon_0 \\omega_{pe}^2$, we get:\n    $$\\langle U_{KE} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{\\varepsilon_0^2 \\omega^2}{\\varepsilon_0 \\omega_{pe}^2} E_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} E_{max}^2$$\n\n**Fraction of Kinetic Energy**\n\nThe problem defines the total wave energy as the sum of the time-averaged electron kinetic and electric field energy densities. The desired fraction is:\n$$\\mathcal{F} = \\frac{\\langle U_{KE} \\rangle}{\\langle U_{KE} \\rangle + \\langle U_E \\rangle} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4} \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} E_{max}^2}{\\frac{1}{4} \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} E_{max}^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\varepsilon_0 E_{max}^2}$$\nThe common factor $\\frac{1}{4}\\varepsilon_0 E_{max}^2$ cancels:\n$$\\mathcal{F} = \\frac{\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2}}{\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} + 1} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2 + \\omega_{pe}^2}$$\nNow, we express this in terms of the dimensionless parameter $k\\lambda_D$. Using the dispersion relation $\\omega^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 v_{Te}^2 k^2$ and the definition $\\lambda_D = v_{Te}/\\omega_{pe}$:\n$$\\omega^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 (\\lambda_D \\omega_{pe})^2 k^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2 \\left(1 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2\\right)$$\nSubstitute this expression for $\\omega^2$ into the formula for $\\mathcal{F}$:\n$$\\mathcal{F} = \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2 \\left(1 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2\\right)}{\\omega_{pe}^2 \\left(1 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2\\right) + \\omega_{pe}^2}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $\\omega_{pe}^2$:\n$$\\mathcal{F} = \\frac{1 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2}{\\left(1 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2\\right) + 1} = \\frac{1 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2}{2 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2}$$\n\n**Interpretation of Limits**\n\n1.  **Long Wavelength Limit ($k\\lambda_{D} \\ll 1$):**\n    In this limit, the term $(k\\lambda_{D})^2$ is negligible compared to $1$.\n    $$\\mathcal{F} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$$\n    This means that for wavelengths much longer than the Debye length, the wave energy is partitioned equally between the kinetic energy of the electrons' coherent motion and the energy stored in the electrostatic field. The wave behaves as a pure plasma oscillation at $\\omega \\approx \\omega_{pe}$, where the electric field provides the restoring force, akin to a simple harmonic oscillator where kinetic and potential energies are equal on average.\n\n2.  **Short Wavelength Limit ($k\\lambda_{D} \\gg 1$):**\n    In this limit, the term $(k\\lambda_{D})^2$ is much larger than $1$.

The dispersion relation becomes $\\omega^2 \\approx 3 v_{Te}^2 k^2$, which describes an electron acoustic wave where pressure, not the electric field, is the primary restoring force.

The species are denoted by the index $j$, where $j=e$ for electrons and $j=i$ for ions. The plasma is unmagnetized, and we consider longitudinal electrostatic waves. The linearized equations for a given species $j$ are:\nThe continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial n_{j1}}{\\partial t} + n_0 \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j1} = 0 $$\nThe momentum equation, with an isothermal pressure $p_j = n_j k_B T_j$:\n$$ m_j n_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_{j1}}{\\partial t} = q_j n_0 \\mathbf{E}_1 - k_B T_j \\nabla n_{j1} $$\nAnd Gauss's law for the electric field, which takes the form of Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi_1$ (where $\\mathbf{E}_1 = -\\nabla\\phi_1$):\n$$ -\\nabla^2 \\phi_1 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\sum_j q_j n_{j1} = \\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0} (n_{i1} - n_{e1}) $$\nHere, $n_{j1}$, $\\mathbf{v}_{j1}$, and $\\mathbf{E}_1$ are the first-order perturbations of the number density, fluid velocity, and electric field, respectively, about a uniform equilibrium with number density $n_0$. The equilibrium charge neutrality implies $n_{e0} = n_{i0} = n_0$. For electrons, $q_e = -e$, and for singly ionized deuterium ions, $q_i = +e$.\n\nWe assume harmonic perturbations of the form $\\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)]$. This allows us to make the substitutions $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow -i\\omega$ and $\\nabla \\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k}$. For longitudinal waves, $\\mathbf{v}_{j1}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nThe continuity equation becomes:\n$$ -i\\omega n_{j1} + n_0 (i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{j1}) = 0 \\implies \\omega n_{j1} = n_0 k v_{j1} $$\nFrom this, we find the perturbed velocity in terms of the perturbed density:\n$$ v_{j1} = \\frac{\\omega}{k} \\frac{n_{j1}}{n_0} $$\nThe momentum equation becomes:\n$$ m_j n_0 (-i\\omega) v_{j1} = q_j n_0 (-ik \\phi_1) - k_B T_j (ik n_{j1}) $$\nDividing by $-in_0$ gives:\n$$ m_j \\omega v_{j1} = q_j k \\phi_1 + k_B T_j k \\frac{n_{j1}}{n_0} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{j1}$ into the momentum equation yields:\n$$ m_j \\omega \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{k} \\frac{n_{j1}}{n_0}\\right) = q_j k \\phi_1 + k_B T_j k \\frac{n_{j1}}{n_0} $$\nWe rearrange this to solve for the fractional density perturbation, $n_{j1}/n_0$:\n$$ n_{j1} \\left( \\frac{m_j \\omega^2}{k} - \\frac{k_B T_j k}{1} \\right) = n_0 q_j k \\phi_1 $$\n$$ \\frac{n_{j1}}{n_0} = \\frac{q_j k^2 \\phi_1}{m_j \\omega^2 - k_B T_j k^2} $$\nWe now write this for electrons ($j=e$, $q_e=-e$) and ions ($j=i$, $q_i=+e$):\n$$ \\frac{n_{e1}}{n_0} = \\frac{-e k^2 \\phi_1}{m_e \\omega^2 - k_B T_e k^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{n_{i1}}{n_0} = \\frac{e k^2 \\phi_1}{m_i \\omega^2 - k_B T_i k^2} $$\nNext, we substitute these density perturbations into the Fourier-transformed Poisson's equation, $k^2 \\phi_1 = \\frac{e}{\\epsilon_0} (n_{i1} - n_{e1})$:\n$$ k^2 \\phi_1 = \\frac{e n_0}{\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{e k^2 \\phi_1}{m_i \\omega^2 - k_B T_i k^2} - \\frac{-e k^2 \\phi_1}{m_e \\omega^2 - k_B T_e k^2} \\right) $$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($\\phi_1 \\neq 0$), we can cancel $k^2 \\phi_1$ from both sides:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{m_i \\omega^2 - k_B T_i k^2} + \\frac{1}{m_e \\omega^2 - k_B T_e k^2} \\right) $$\nThis is the general electrostatic dispersion relation. To find the ion acoustic branch, we consider low-frequency waves, $\\omega \\ll \\omega_{pe}$ (electron plasma frequency), with phase velocities $v_p = \\omega/k$ such that $v_{Ti} \\ll v_p \\ll v_{Te}$, where $v_{Tj} = \\sqrt{k_B T_j / m_j}$. The condition $v_p \\ll v_{Te}$ is equivalent to $\\omega^2 \\ll k^2 v_{Te}^2 = k^2 k_B T_e / m_e$. Under this assumption, the electron term in the dispersion relation simplifies:\n$$ m_e \\omega^2 - k_B T_e k^2 \\approx -k_B T_e k^2 $$\nThe dispersion relation becomes:\n$$ 1 \\approx \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{m_i \\omega^2 - k_B T_i k^2} - \\frac{1}{k_B T_e k^2} \\right) $$\nUsing the definitions of the ion plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pi}^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_i}$, and the electron Debye length, $\\lambda_D^2 = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_0 e^2}$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ 1 \\approx \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2 m_i}{m_i \\omega^2 - k_B T_i k^2} - \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_D^2} \\implies 1 + \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_D^2} = \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2 - (k_B T_i/m_i) k^2} $$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$:\n$$ \\omega^2 - \\frac{k_B T_i}{m_i} k^2 = \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{1 + 1/(k^2 \\lambda_D^2)} = \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2 k^2 \\lambda_D^2}{1 + k^2 \\lambda_D^2} $$\nSubstituting $\\omega_{pi}^2 \\lambda_D^2 = (\\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_i}) (\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_0 e^2}) = \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}$:\n$$ \\omega^2 = \\frac{k_B T_i}{m_i} k^2 + \\frac{(k_B T_e/m_i) k^2}{1 + k^2 \\lambda_D^2} $$\nThis gives the final form of the ion acoustic branch dispersion relation that retains finite Debye shielding:\n$$ \\omega^2 = \\frac{k^2}{m_i} \\left( k_B T_i + \\frac{k_B T_e}{1 + k^2 \\lambda_D^2} \\right) $$\n\n**Part 2: Identification of Physical Requirements**\n(i) The quasi-neutrality requirement, $k \\lambda_D \\ll 1$: This condition signifies that the wavelength of the perturbation ($2\\pi/k$) is much larger than the Debye length $\\lambda_D$. In this limit, charge separation is ineffective over the scale of a wavelength. In our derived dispersion relation, if $k \\lambda_D \\ll 1$, then $k^2 \\lambda_D^2 \\ll 1$, and the denominator $1 + k^2 \\lambda_D^2 \\approx 1$. The dispersion relation simplifies to $\\omega^2 \\approx \\frac{k^2}{m_i}(k_B T_i + k_B T_e) = k^2 c_s^2$, which is the dispersion for ion acoustic waves in a perfectly quasi-neutral plasma. The term $k^2 \\lambda_D^2$ thus represents the correction due to imperfect shielding, and for the quasi-neutral approximation to be valid, we require $k\\lambda_D \\ll 1$.\n\n(ii) The small electron inertia requirement, $\\omega^2 / (k^2 v_{Te}^2) \\ll 1$: This condition was used to derive the simplified dispersion relation from the general one. It ensures that the electron fluid can respond almost instantaneously to potential perturbations to establish a Boltzmann distribution, $n_{e1}/n_0 \\approx e\\phi_1/(k_B T_e)$. The ratio $\\omega^2 / (k^2 v_{Te}^2)$ compares the electron inertia term ($m_e \\omega^2$) to the electron pressure term ($k_B T_e k^2$) in the electron response function. Requiring this ratio to be small is essential for the ion acoustic wave mode to exist.\n\n**Part 3: Determination of $k_{\\max}$**\nWe must find the maximum wavenumber $k_{\\max}$ that simultaneously satisfies:\n1. $k \\lambda_D \\leq \\delta_{\\mathrm{QN}}$, with $\\delta_{\\mathrm{QN}} = 0.10$.\n2. $\\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2 v_{Te}^2} \\leq \\delta_{e}$, with $\\delta_{e} = 0.010$.\n\nLet's analyze the second constraint using our derived dispersion relation for $\\omega^2$:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2 v_{Te}^2} = \\frac{1}{v_{Te}^2} \\frac{1}{m_i} \\left( k_B T_i + \\frac{k_B T_e}{1 + k^2 \\lambda_D^2} \\right) $$\nSubstituting $v_{Te}^2 = k_B T_e / m_e$:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2 v_{Te}^2} = \\frac{m_e}{k_B T_e m_i} \\left( k_B T_i + \\frac{k_B T_e}{1 + k^2 \\lambda_D^2} \\right) = \\frac{m_e}{m_i} \\left( \\frac{T_i}{T_e} + \\frac{1}{1 + k^2 \\lambda_D^2} \\right) $$\nThe constraint is thus:\n$$ \\frac{m_e}{m_i} \\left( \\frac{T_i}{T_e} + \\frac{1}{1 + k^2 \\lambda_D^2} \\right) \\leq \\delta_e $$\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of this inequality is a monotonically decreasing function of $k$ for $k \\geq 0$. Its maximum value occurs at $k=0$:\n$$ \\text{LHS}_{\\max} = \\frac{m_e}{m_i} \\left( \\frac{T_i}{T_e} + 1 \\right) $$\nUsing the given parameters: $T_i/T_e = (1.0 \\text{ keV}) / (3.0 \\text{ keV}) = 1/3$. The ion is deuterium ($m_i = 2 m_p$).\n$m_i = 2 \\times 1.672\\,621\\,92369 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg} = 3.3452438... \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n$m_e = 9.109\\,383\\,7015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$ \\frac{m_e}{m_i} \\approx \\frac{9.109 \\times 10^{-31}}{3.345 \\times 10^{-27}} \\approx 2.723 \\times 10^{-4} $$\n$$ \\text{LHS}_{\\max} \\approx (2.723 \\times 10^{-4}) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + 1 \\right) = (2.723 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 3.63 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nThe constraint requires $\\text{LHS} \\leq \\delta_e = 0.010$. Since the maximum value of the LHS is $\\approx 3.63 \\times 10^{-4}$, which is much smaller than $0.010$, this second condition is satisfied for all values of $k$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum wavenumber $k_{\\max}$ is determined solely by the first constraint:\n$$ k \\lambda_D \\leq \\delta_{\\mathrm{QN}} \\implies k_{\\max} = \\frac{\\delta_{\\mathrm{QN}}}{\\lambda_D} $$\nWe now calculate the Debye length $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_0 e^2}}$.\nThe value $T_e = 3.0 \\text{ keV}$ is interpreted as the energy $k_B T_e$.\n$k_B T_e = 3.0 \\times 10^3 \\text{ eV} = 3000 \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}) = 4.806529902 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}$.\nThe given parameters are:\n$\\epsilon_0 = 8.854\\,187\\,8128 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$\n$n_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$e = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n\nNumerator of $\\lambda_D^2$:\n$\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e = (8.854\\,187\\,8128 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (4.806529902 \\times 10^{-16}) \\approx 4.256209 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{F/m}$.\nDenominator of $\\lambda_D^2$:\n$n_0 e^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{20}) \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19})^2 \\approx 2.566970 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ C}^2/\\text{m}^3$.\n$$ \\lambda_D^2 = \\frac{4.256209 \\times 10^{-27}}{2.566970 \\times 10^{-18}} \\approx 1.658063 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{1.658063 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 4.071932 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m} $$\nNow we find $k_{\\max}$:\n$$ k_{\\max} = \\frac{\\delta_{\\mathrm{QN}}}{\\lambda_D} = \\frac{0.10}{4.071932 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}} \\approx 2455.836 \\text{ m}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $2460 \\text{ m}^{-1}$.
