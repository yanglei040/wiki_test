The provided physical parameters, while representing a high-performance device, are physically consistent and realistic within the context of modern fusion research. Therefore, the problem is valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and calculation of the electron cyclotron frequency.\n\nWe begin with the Lorentz force law for a charged particle in a magnetic field, neglecting any electric field:\n$$ \\vec{F} = q (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) $$\nFor an electron, the charge is $q = -e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The equation of motion is given by Newton's second law, $m_e \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\vec{F}$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n$$ m_e \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = -e (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) $$\nThis force is always perpendicular to the velocity $\\vec{v}$, so it does no work and does not change the electron's kinetic energy. It causes the velocity vector component perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$, denoted $\\vec{v}_{\\perp}$, to rotate. This leads to a circular or helical trajectory. The magnetic force provides the necessary centripetal force for this circular motion. The magnitude of the centripetal force is $F_c = m_e a_c$, where $a_c$ is the centripetal acceleration. For circular motion with an angular frequency $\\omega$ and perpendicular speed $v_{\\perp}$, the acceleration is $a_c = \\omega v_{\\perp}$. The magnitude of the magnetic force is $F_{mag} = e v_{\\perp} B$, assuming $\\vec{v}_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$.\n\nEquating the magnitudes of the magnetic force and the centripetal force:\n$$ e v_{\\perp} B = m_e \\omega v_{\\perp} $$\nSolving for the angular frequency $\\omega$ gives the electron cyclotron angular frequency, $\\omega_{ce}$:\n$$ \\omega_{ce} = \\frac{e B}{m_e} $$\nThe frequency $f$ is related to the angular frequency $\\omega$ by $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Therefore, the electron cyclotron frequency, $f_{ce}$, is:\n$$ f_{ce} = \\frac{\\omega_{ce}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{e B}{2 \\pi m_e} $$\nThe problem requires the gyrotron frequency needed to drive the fundamental resonance ($\\omega = \\omega_{ce}$) on the magnetic axis, where the magnetic field is $B = B_0 = 6$ T.\nWe use the following values for the physical constants:\n-   Elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.60217663 \\times 10^{-19}$ C\n-   Electron rest mass, $m_e \\approx 9.1093837 \\times 10^{-31}$ kg\n-   On-axis magnetic field, $B_0 = 6$ T\n\nThe required frequency $f_{ce0}$ is:\n$$ f_{ce0} = \\frac{e B_0}{2 \\pi m_e} \\approx \\frac{(1.60217663 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}) (6 \\, \\text{T})}{2 \\pi (9.1093837 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})} $$\n$$ f_{ce0} \\approx \\frac{9.61305978 \\times 10^{-19}}{5.724486 \\times 10^{-30}} \\, \\text{Hz} \\approx 1.67923 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{Hz} $$\nConverting to gigahertz (GHz), where $1$ GHz $= 10^9$ Hz:\n$$ f_{ce0} \\approx 167.923 \\, \\text{GHz} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the required gyrotron frequency is $168$ GHz.\n\nPart 2: Accessibility of the fundamental X-mode from the low-field side.\n\nWe must assess if an electromagnetic wave with frequency $\\omega = \\omega_{ce0}$ (where $\\omega_{ce0} = eB_0/m_e$) can propagate from the low-field side (where $B  B_0$) to the resonance layer on the magnetic axis (where $B = B_0$). The problem specifies perpendicular launch, which corresponds to the extraordinary mode (X-mode) in a magnetized plasma.\n\nIn a cold plasma, the propagation of the X-mode perpendicular to the magnetic field is governed by a dispersion relation that determines where the wave can propagate ($N^2 > 0$) and where it is evanescent ($N^2  0$). The boundaries between these regions are defined by cutoffs ($N^2=0$) and resonances ($N^2 \\to \\infty$). For the X-mode, the relevant cutoffs are the right-hand (R) cutoff, $\\omega_R$, and the left-hand (L) cutoff, $\\omega_L$. For a wave launched from the low-field side with frequency $\\omega = \\omega_{ce0}$, the crucial barrier is the R-cutoff.\n\nThe R-cutoff frequency is given by:\n$$ \\omega_R = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\omega_{ce} + \\sqrt{\\omega_{ce}^2 + 4\\omega_{pe}^2} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\omega_{ce} = eB/m_e$ is the local cyclotron frequency and $\\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{n_e e^2 / (\\epsilon_0 m_e)}$ is the local plasma frequency. Both $\\omega_{ce}$ and $\\omega_{pe}$ vary with position. In a tokamak, the magnetic field $B$ generally decreases with major radius, so the low-field side corresponds to the outer part of the torus. A wave launched from the low-field side starts in a region of low $B$ and low $n_e$ and propagates towards the core where $B$ and $n_e$ are maximum.\n\nThe wave has a fixed frequency $\\omega = \\omega_{ce0}$. It will be cut off (i.e., reflected) if it encounters a region where $\\omega \\le \\omega_R$. The condition for a cutoff to exist is $\\omega_{ce0} = \\omega_R$. Let's solve this for the plasma parameters:\n$$ \\omega_{ce0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\omega_{ce} + \\sqrt{\\omega_{ce}^2 + 4\\omega_{pe}^2} \\right) $$\n$$ 2\\omega_{ce0} - \\omega_{ce} = \\sqrt{\\omega_{ce}^2 + 4\\omega_{pe}^2} $$\n$$ (2\\omega_{ce0} - \\omega_{ce})^2 = \\omega_{ce}^2 + 4\\omega_{pe}^2 $$\n$$ 4\\omega_{ce0}^2 - 4\\omega_{ce0}\\omega_{ce} + \\omega_{ce}^2 = \\omega_{ce}^2 + 4\\omega_{pe}^2 $$\n$$ \\omega_{ce0}^2 - \\omega_{ce0}\\omega_{ce} = \\omega_{pe}^2 $$\n$$ \\omega_{pe}^2 = \\omega_{ce0} (\\omega_{ce0} - \\omega_{ce}) $$\nFor a launch from the low-field side, the wave propagates through regions where $B  B_0$, which implies $\\omega_{ce}  \\omega_{ce0}$. In such regions, the term $(\\omega_{ce0} - \\omega_{ce})$ is positive. Since $\\omega_{pe}^2$ is also positive for any non-zero density, a cutoff layer will exist at any location where the local density and magnetic field satisfy this equation. The wave is launched from the vacuum region ($n_e=0$) into the plasma. As it propagates inward, both $n_e$ and $B$ increase. There will be a radius $R_{cutoff}$ on the low-field side where the condition is met, creating an evanescent layer between the cutoff and the resonance that blocks the wave. Therefore, fundamental X-mode heating is not accessible from the low-field side.\n\nTo provide a quantitative comparison, we check the condition for accessibility at the plasma core. A general accessibility condition for the $n$-th harmonic X-mode from the low-field side is $\\omega_{pe0}^2  n(n-1)\\omega_{ce0}^2$. For the fundamental mode, $n=1$, this gives $\\omega_{pe0}^2  0$, which is impossible for any plasma. This confirms the cutoff always exists.\n\nLet's check for higher harmonics. The core plasma frequency squared is:\n$$ \\omega_{pe0}^2 = \\frac{n_{e0} e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e} = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}) (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C})^2}{(8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{F/m}) (9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})} \\approx 4.76 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{s}^{-2} $$\nThe on-axis cyclotron frequency squared is:\n$$ \\omega_{ce0}^2 = \\left( \\frac{e B_0}{m_e} \\right)^2 = (2\\pi f_{ce0})^2 \\approx (2\\pi \\times 1.679 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{s}^{-1})^2 \\approx 1.11 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{s}^{-2} $$\nThe ratio is $\\frac{\\omega_{pe0}^2}{\\omega_{ce0}^2} \\approx \\frac{4.76 \\times 10^{24}}{1.11 \\times 10^{24}} \\approx 4.28$.\nFor the second harmonic ($n=2$), the accessibility condition is $\\omega_{pe0}^2  2(2-1)\\omega_{ce0}^2$, or $\\omega_{pe0}^2  2\\omega_{ce0}^2$. In our case, this is $4.28  2$, which is false. Thus, even the second harmonic is cut off for these high-density parameters.\nFor the third harmonic ($n=3$), the accessibility condition is $\\omega_{pe0}^2  3(3-1)\\omega_{ce0}^2$, or $\\omega_{pe0}^2  6\\omega_{ce0}^2$. In our case, $4.28  6$, which is true. Therefore, the third harmonic X-mode *can* access the core resonance from the low-field side.\n\nThis analysis confirms the final statement in the problem: in high-field, high-density devices (where the ratio $\\omega_{pe0}^2/\\omega_{ce0}^2$ is large), the right-hand cutoff prevents low-field-side access for the fundamental and sometimes even the second harmonic. Consequently, designers must use higher harmonics (e.g., third harmonic) or alternative launch scenarios (e.g., high-field-side launch, or oblique launch for mode conversion to electron Bernstein waves) to heat the plasma core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{168}$$", "id": "3697602"}, {"introduction": "While the X-mode faces cutoffs related to the magnetic field, the alternative ordinary mode (O-mode) is constrained by a different fundamental limit related to the plasma density.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the O-mode cutoff density begins with the linearized equation of motion for an electron in a cold, magnetized plasma, subjected to the electric field of an electromagnetic wave. The static magnetic field is taken to be along the $z$-axis, $\\mathbf{B}_{0} = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The wave fields are assumed to have a time-dependence of the form $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$, so the time derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is replaced by $-i\\omega$.\n\nThe linearized electron momentum equation is:\n$$m_e \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_1}{\\partial t} = -e(\\mathbf{E}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_1 \\times \\mathbf{B}_0)$$\nwhere $m_e$ is the electron mass, $-e$ is the electron charge, $\\mathbf{v}_1$ is the perturbed electron fluid velocity, and $\\mathbf{E}_1$ is the wave electric field.\n\nSubstituting the time-harmonic dependence, we get:\n$$-i\\omega m_e \\mathbf{v}_1 = -e(\\mathbf{E}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_1 \\times B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$$\nThe problem asks for the longitudinal dielectric response, which is the response parallel to $\\mathbf{B}_0$. We only need to consider the $z$-component of this vector equation:\n$$-i\\omega m_e v_{1,z} = -e E_{1,z}$$\nThe term $\\mathbf{v}_1 \\times \\mathbf{B}_0$ has no $z$-component, so it does not appear in this equation. Solving for the longitudinal velocity component $v_{1,z}$:\n$$v_{1,z} = \\frac{-e E_{1,z}}{-i\\omega m_e} = \\frac{i e}{\\omega m_e} E_{1,z}$$\nThe perturbed current density $\\mathbf{J}_1$ is given by $\\mathbf{J}_1 = -n_e e \\mathbf{v}_1$, where $n_e$ is the unperturbed electron number density. The longitudinal component of the current density is:\n$$J_{1,z} = -n_e e v_{1,z} = -n_e e \\left(\\frac{i e}{\\omega m_e} E_{1,z}\\right) = -\\frac{i n_e e^2}{\\omega m_e} E_{1,z}$$\nThe dielectric tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ relates the displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. From Maxwell's equations in a medium, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J}_1 + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}_0}{\\partial t}$, where $\\mathbf{D}_0 = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_1$ is the vacuum displacement. For time-harmonic fields, this is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J}_1 - i\\omega \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_1$. We can also write this as $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = -i\\omega \\mathbf{D} = -i\\omega \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\mathbf{E}_1$.\nThus, $-i\\omega \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\mathbf{E}_1 = \\mathbf{J}_1 - i\\omega \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_1$. Dividing by $-i\\omega$ and rearranging gives $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\mathbf{E}_1 = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_1 + \\frac{i}{\\omega}\\mathbf{J}_1$. If we work with the relative dielectric tensor, denoted by the same symbol, we have $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{I} + \\frac{i}{\\omega \\epsilon_0} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $\\mathbf{J}_1 = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{E}_1$.\n\nFrom our expression for $J_{1,z}$, we can identify the longitudinal component of the conductivity tensor, $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$\\sigma_{zz} = -\\frac{i n_e e^2}{\\omega m_e}$$\nThe longitudinal component of the relative dielectric tensor, which is the Stix parameter $P$, is $\\varepsilon_{zz}$:\n$$P = \\varepsilon_{zz} = 1 + \\frac{i}{\\omega \\epsilon_0} \\sigma_{zz} = 1 + \\frac{i}{\\omega \\epsilon_0} \\left(-\\frac{i n_e e^2}{\\omega m_e}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0 \\omega^2}$$\nThis can be written in terms of the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}}$, as:\n$$P = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2}$$\nThe problem states that the O-mode cutoff condition is $P=0$. This is the plasma cutoff, where the refractive index for the O-mode propagating perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}_0$ goes to zero. Setting $P=0$:\n$$1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2} = 0 \\implies \\omega^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2$$\nThe cutoff occurs when the wave frequency $\\omega$ equals the electron plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$. We are looking for the cutoff density $n_{c,O}$ corresponding to this condition. Substituting the definition of $\\omega_{pe}$ with $n_e = n_{c,O}$:\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{n_{c,O} e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}$$\nSolving for the O-mode cutoff density $n_{c,O}$:\n$$n_{c,O} = \\frac{m_e \\epsilon_0 \\omega^2}{e^2}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nNext, we evaluate $n_{c,O}$ for the given frequency $f = 140 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi (140 \\times 10^{9})\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\nWe use the following values for the fundamental constants:\n- Electron mass, $m_e \\approx 9.10938 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_0 \\approx 8.854187 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n- Elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.602176 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $n_{c,O}$:\n$$n_{c,O} = \\frac{(9.10938 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg})(8.854187 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m})(2\\pi \\times 140 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^2}{(1.602176 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2}$$\n$$n_{c,O} \\approx \\frac{(8.0640 \\times 10^{-42}) (8.79646 \\times 10^{11})^2}{2.56697 \\times 10^{-38}} \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n$$n_{c,O} \\approx \\frac{(8.0640 \\times 10^{-42}) (7.73777 \\times 10^{23})}{2.56697 \\times 10^{-38}} \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n$$n_{c,O} \\approx \\frac{6.2402 \\times 10^{-18}}{2.56697 \\times 10^{-38}} \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n$$n_{c,O} \\approx 2.4310 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the cutoff density is $2.43 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n\nFinally, a brief comment on accessibility in an overdense plasma with $n_{e}^{\\text{edge}} > n_{c,O}$.\nA wave cutoff is a condition where the refractive index $n$ becomes zero, leading to reflection of the wave. For densities $n_e > n_{c,O}$, the refractive index squared for the O-mode becomes negative ($n^2 = P = 1 - n_e/n_{c,O}  0$), meaning $n$ is purely imaginary. An imaginary refractive index signifies an evanescent wave, which does not propagate but is exponentially damped. If an O-mode wave is launched from the low-field side (the outside of the torus), it first encounters the plasma at its edge. The problem specifies that the edge density $n_{e}^{\\text{edge}}$ is greater than the O-mode cutoff density $n_{c,O}$. Therefore, the wave encounters a cutoff layer ($n_e > n_{c,O}$) immediately upon entering the plasma. The wave becomes evanescent at the boundary and is reflected before it can propagate into the plasma core to reach a potential resonance layer. Consequently, for O-mode ECRH launched from the low-field side, the plasma core is inaccessible under the condition $n_{e}^{\\text{edge}} > n_{c,O}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.43 \\times 10^{20}}$$", "id": "3697613"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful features of ECRH is the ability to deposit energy in highly localized regions, enabling precise control over plasma profiles.

The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe fundamental condition for Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) is that the frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave, $f$, must match a harmonic, $s$, of the relativistic electron cyclotron frequency, $f_{ce}$.

This requires the derivative of $f(r)$ with respect to $r$:\n$$\\frac{df}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{K}{R_0 + r} \\right) = -K (R_0 + r)^{-2} = -\\frac{K}{(R_0 + r)^2}$$\nFor small deviations, we have the linear approximation $\\Delta f \\approx \\frac{df}{dr} \\Delta r$. Evaluating the derivative at the nominal radius $r_0$:\n$$\\Delta f \\approx \\left. \\frac{df}{dr} \\right|_{r=r_0} \\Delta r = -\\frac{K}{(R_0 + r_0)^2} \\Delta r$$\nThe constant $K$ contains terms ($B_{\\mathrm{axis}}$, $\\gamma_0$) that are not provided. However, we can eliminate $K$ by using the nominal resonance condition. At $r=r_0$, the wave frequency is $f_0$:\n$$f_0 = f(r_0) = \\frac{K}{R_0 + r_0}$$\nFrom this, we solve for $K$:\n$$K = f_0 (R_0 + r_0)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $K$ back into the relation for $\\Delta f$:\n$$\\Delta f \\approx -\\frac{f_0 (R_0 + r_0)}{(R_0 + r_0)^2} \\Delta r = -\\frac{f_0}{R_0 + r_0} \\Delta r$$\nThis is the derived relationship between the frequency chirp $\\Delta f$ and the shift in resonance radius $\\Delta r$. The negative sign correctly indicates that an outward shift in radius ($\\Delta r > 0$) requires a lower frequency ($\\Delta f  0$) because the magnetic field strength decreases with increasing radius.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum allowable absolute frequency deviation, $|\\Delta f|_{\\max}$, that keeps the deposition region within a radial excursion of $|\\Delta r| \\le \\Delta r_{\\max}$. Taking the absolute value of our derived relationship:\n$$|\\Delta f| \\approx \\frac{f_0}{R_0 + r_0} |\\Delta r|$$\nThe maximum frequency deviation occurs for the maximum radial excursion, $\\Delta r_{\\max}$:\n$$|\\Delta f|_{\\max} = \\frac{f_0}{R_0 + r_0} \\Delta r_{\\max}$$\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $f_0 = 140\\,\\mathrm{GHz} = 1.40 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $R_0 = 3.00\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $r_0 = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\Delta r_{\\max} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.0100\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the major radius of the deposition location:\n$$R_0 + r_0 = 3.00\\,\\mathrm{m} + 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m} = 3.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nNow, we substitute the values into the expression for $|\\Delta f|_{\\max}$:\n$$|\\Delta f|_{\\max} = \\frac{1.40 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{3.50\\,\\mathrm{m}} (0.0100\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$|\\Delta f|_{\\max} = (0.400 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Hz/m}) \\times (0.0100\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$|\\Delta f|_{\\max} = 4.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe question requests the answer in megahertz (MHz). Since $1\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, we convert the result:\n$$|\\Delta f|_{\\max} = (4.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{MHz}}{10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 4.00 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 400\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$$\nThe result is to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $400$. Expressed to three significant figures, this is $4.00 \\times 10^2$, which is numerically $400$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{400}$$", "id": "3697606"}]}
