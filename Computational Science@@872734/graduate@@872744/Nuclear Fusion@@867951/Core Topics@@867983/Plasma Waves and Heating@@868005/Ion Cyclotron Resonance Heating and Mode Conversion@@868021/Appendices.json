This product contains terms oscillating at various frequencies. A secular, or time-averaged, net energy transfer from the wave to the particle occurs only if a term in the product becomes time-independent. This requires a frequency in the expansion of $\\mathbf{E}$ to match a frequency present in $\\mathbf{v}$. The velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}(t)$ oscillates at the fundamental frequency $\\Omega_i$. The electric field, as seen by the particle, has components oscillating at frequencies $|\\omega - n\\Omega_i|$. A resonant interaction leading to continuous energy absorption happens when the wave frequency matches a harmonic of the cyclotron frequency, i.e., when a term in the phase $(n\\Omega_i - \\omega)t$ becomes constant. This occurs when $n\\Omega_i - \\omega = 0$, which gives the resonance condition $\\omega = n\\Omega_i$.\n\nThe strength of the interaction at the $n$-th harmonic is determined by the amplitude of the corresponding term in the Fourier expansion of the field, which is proportional to the Bessel function $J_{n}(\\lambda)$. The power absorbed by the particles is proportional to the square of the interaction strength. Therefore, the coupling strength for the $n$-th harmonic resonance scales as $J_{n}^{2}(\\lambda)$.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical calculation.\nFirst, we convert the ion temperature $T_i$ from keV to Joules:\n$$ T_{i,J} = (8 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) = 1.2816 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nNext, we calculate the deuterium ion cyclotron frequency $\\Omega_{i}$:\n$$ \\Omega_{i} = \\frac{eB}{m_{D}} = \\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (5.3\\,\\mathrm{T})}{3.344 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 2.53905 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} $$\nUsing the given definition, we calculate the thermal perpendicular speed $v_{Ti}$. Here, $k_{B}T_{i}$ corresponds to the energy $T_{i,J}$:\n$$ v_{Ti} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{D}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.2816 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J})}{3.344 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx 8.7550 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} $$\nThe thermal Larmor radius $\\rho_{Ti}$ is then:\n$$ \\rho_{Ti} = \\frac{v_{Ti}}{\\Omega_{i}} = \\frac{8.7550 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{2.53905 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}} \\approx 0.0034481\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe argument of the Bessel functions, $\\lambda$, is estimated using this thermal Larmor radius:\n$$ \\lambda = k_{\\perp} \\rho_{Ti} = (40\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (0.0034481\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\approx 0.13792 $$\nThe value of $\\lambda$ is small ($\\lambda \\ll 1$). For small arguments $x$, the Bessel function of the first kind, $J_n(x)$, can be accurately approximated by the first term of its series expansion:\n$$ J_{n}(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{n!} \\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right)^{n} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad |x| \\ll \\sqrt{n+1} $$\nThis approximation is valid for our value of $\\lambda \\approx 0.13792$ and for $n=2$ and $n=3$.\nUsing this approximation for $n=2$ and $n=3$:\n$$ J_{2}(\\lambda) \\approx \\frac{1}{2!} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{8} $$\n$$ J_{3}(\\lambda) \\approx \\frac{1}{3!} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\right)^{3} = \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{\\lambda^{3}}{8} = \\frac{\\lambda^{3}}{48} $$\nWe can now compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{J_{2}^{2}(\\lambda)}{J_{3}^{2}(\\lambda)} \\approx \\frac{(\\lambda^{2}/8)^{2}}{(\\lambda^{3}/48)^{2}} = \\frac{\\lambda^{4}/64}{\\lambda^{6}/2304} = \\frac{2304}{64\\lambda^{2}} = \\frac{36}{\\lambda^{2}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical value of $\\lambda$:\n$$ R \\approx \\frac{36}{(0.13792)^{2}} \\approx \\frac{36}{0.019022} \\approx 1892.5 $$\nFor higher precision, we use more significant figures for $\\lambda$: $\\lambda \\approx 0.1379254$.\n$$ R \\approx \\frac{36}{(0.1379254)^{2}} \\approx \\frac{36}{0.0190234} \\approx 1892.41 $$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $1892$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1892}$$", "id": "3704791"}]}
