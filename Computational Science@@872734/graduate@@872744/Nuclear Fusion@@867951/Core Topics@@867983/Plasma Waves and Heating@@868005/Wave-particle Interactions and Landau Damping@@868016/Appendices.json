It is a standard, well-posed problem in theoretical plasma physics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem concerns Landau damping, a collisionless damping mechanism for plasma waves. The system is described by the one-dimensional Vlasov equation for the electron distribution function $f(x,v,t)$ and Poisson’s equation for the self-consistent electric field $E(x,t)$.\n\nVlasov equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} - \\frac{eE}{m_e} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} = 0\n$$\n\nPoisson’s equation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} = \\rho = -e \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f \\,dv - n_0 \\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_0$ is the equilibrium electron density which is neutralized by the immobile ion background.\n\nWe consider a small perturbation around a spatially uniform equilibrium: $f(x,v,t) = f_0(v) + f_1(x,v,t)$, where $|f_1| \\ll f_0$. The electric field $E$ is also a first-order quantity. Linearizing the Vlasov equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} - \\frac{eE}{m_e} \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v} = 0\n$$\n\nFor a single Fourier mode, we assume $E(x,t) = E_k(\\omega) e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}$ and $f_1(x,v,t) = f_{1k}(\\omega, v) e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}$. The linearized equation becomes an algebraic equation for $f_{1k}$:\n$$\n-i\\omega f_{1k} + ikv f_{1k} - \\frac{eE_k}{m_e} \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v} = 0 \\implies f_{1k} = \\frac{i e E_k}{m_e(\\omega - kv)} \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v}\n$$\nThe complex frequency $\\omega = \\omega_r + i\\gamma$ has a real part $\\omega_r$ (oscillation frequency) and an imaginary part $\\gamma$ (growth or damping rate). Field decay corresponds to $\\gamma  0$.\n\nThe core of Landau damping lies with the resonant particles, for which $kv \\approx \\omega_r$, or $v \\approx v_\\phi = \\omega_r/k$. For these particles, the denominator in the expression for $f_{1k}$ is small, leading to a strong interaction. A careful mathematical treatment of this pole (the Landau prescription) shows that the damping rate $\\gamma$ is proportional to the slope of the distribution function at the phase velocity:\n$$\n\\gamma \\propto \\left. \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v} \\right|_{v=v_\\phi}\n$$\nThe problem states that $f_0(v)$ is strictly decreasing, so $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v}  0$ at $v=v_\\phi$. This results in $\\gamma  0$, which signifies damping.\n\nThe physical mechanism involves energy exchange between the wave and the resonant particles.\n*   Particles with velocities slightly less than the phase velocity ($v  v_\\phi$) are, on average, accelerated by the wave's electric field. They gain kinetic energy from the wave.\n*   Particles with velocities slightly greater than the phase velocity ($v  v_\\phi$) are, on average, decelerated by the wave's electric field. They lose kinetic energy to the wave.\n\nSince $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v}  0$, there are more particles slightly slower than the wave than there are particles slightly faster. Therefore, the net energy transfer is from the wave to the particles. The wave's electric field energy decreases, and the wave is damped.\n\nThis energy is not dissipated in a thermodynamic sense. The total energy of the isolated Vlasov-Poisson system (particles + field) is conserved. The energy lost by the macroscopic electric field is converted into kinetic energy of the resonant particles, which manifests as increasingly fine-scale oscillations or filaments in the velocity-space structure of the distribution function, $f_1(v)$. This process is called phase mixing. Because the macroscopic field $E$ is an integral (a velocity moment) of the distribution function, these fine-scale oscillations average out, leading to the decay of $E(t)$. In a strictly collisionless system, this process is reversible (as demonstrated by plasma wave echoes), but if even infinitesimal collisions are present, they will act to smooth out the fine velocity-space structures, increasing entropy and making the energy transfer irreversible.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the collisionless Vlasov–Poisson system, the total particle–plus–field energy is exactly conserved; the apparent decay of the electric field amplitude arises from reversible phase mixing that transfers field energy into fine-scale structure in velocity space.**\n*   **Analysis**: This statement is entirely correct. The Vlasov-Poisson system is a Hamiltonian system, and its total energy is a conserved quantity. Landau damping is not a dissipative process in the thermodynamic sense. It is a transfer of energy from the coherent, macroscopic electric field to the kinetic energy of resonant particles. This transfer is encoded in the development of fine-scale filaments in the velocity distribution, a process known as phase mixing. In the absence of collisions, this process is reversible.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The sign of the net wave–particle energy transfer for a nearly monochromatic mode is determined by the slope $\\partial f_0/\\partial v$ evaluated at $v = v_\\phi$: for $\\partial f_0/\\partial v \\lt 0$, the mode loses energy to particles, yielding damping.**\n*   **Analysis**: This is the fundamental condition for linear Landau damping. As explained in the derivation, the net energy transfer depends on the balance between slower particles gaining energy and faster particles losing energy. This balance is dictated by the population difference, which is given by the sign of the slope of the distribution function at the resonant velocity. A negative slope means more slow particles, net energy transfer to particles, and thus wave damping.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Linear Landau damping requires particle trapping and separatrix crossing; without finite perturbation amplitude sufficient to trap particles, the electric field amplitude cannot decay.**\n*   **Analysis**: This statement is fundamentally incorrect. It conflates linear and nonlinear phenomena. Linear Landau damping, described by the linearized Vlasov equation, is valid for infinitesimal perturbations where particle trapping is negligible. Trapping is a nonlinear effect that becomes significant only when the wave amplitude is finite, causing particles near $v_\\phi$ to be caught in the potential wells of the wave. In fact, strong trapping can suppress and eventually halt linear Landau damping. Linear damping relies on the interaction with untrapped, passing particles.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In this context, “phase mixing” refers primarily to dephasing of particle orbits in physical space due to spatial inhomogeneity; it is not associated with the shearing of perturbations in velocity at fixed position.**\n*   **Analysis**: This statement misrepresents the concept of phase mixing in this context. While particles do move in physical space, the essential mechanism of phase mixing leading to Landau damping is the shearing of the perturbed distribution function $f_1$ in velocity space. The free-streaming term, $v \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}$, in the Vlasov equation causes particles with different velocities to evolve differently, leading to the development of increasingly fine structures in $v$ for a given position $x$. The statement that it is *not* associated with this shearing in velocity is false.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Adding very weak collisions always increases the Landau damping rate by sharpening the resonance at $v = v_\\phi$.**\n*   **Analysis**: This statement is incorrect. Collisions, in general, act to broaden resonances, not sharpen them. They introduce a velocity-space diffusion that randomizes particle velocities, working against the coherent resonant interaction required for Landau damping. While collisions make the overall energy loss from the wave irreversible, they do not necessarily increase the initial, collisionless damping rate. In fact, in the limit of high collisionality, the plasma behaves as a fluid, and Landau damping is replaced by collisional damping mechanisms. The claim that weak collisions *always increase* the rate is false.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. When weak but finite collisions act on the velocity-space filaments produced by collisionless phase mixing, entropy increases and the electric field energy is irreversibly converted into thermal energy; collisionless damping sets the route by which energy reaches collisional scales where it is dissipated.**\n*   **Analysis**: This is a conceptually advanced and accurate statement. The fine velocity-space filaments created by phase mixing have very large velocity gradients. Collisional operators typically involve second derivatives in velocity (e.g., $\\propto \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial v^2}$). Therefore, even weak collisions are highly effective at smoothing out these fine structures. This smoothing process is irreversible and corresponds to an increase in the thermodynamic entropy of the system, converting the ordered kinetic energy of the filaments into random thermal motion (heat). Thus, collisionless damping provides a fast pathway for wave energy to be moved to very small scales in velocity space, where collisions can then efficiently and irreversibly dissipate it.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABF}$$", "id": "3725745"}, {"introduction": "The term \"damping\" in Landau damping can be misleading, as it does not imply true thermodynamic dissipation.

The solution process will proceed with an analysis of the governing principles and an evaluation of each option.\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the collisionless Vlasov-Poisson equations. In one dimension, for a species with charge $q$ and mass $m$, these are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{qE}{m} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} = 0 \\quad \\text{(Vlasov Equation)}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} = \\rho(x,t) = q \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x,v,t) \\, \\mathrm{d}v - n_0 \\right) \\quad \\text{(Poisson's Equation)}\n$$\nwhere $n_0$ is the uniform background ion density.\n\nThe Vlasov equation states that the distribution function $f$ is conserved along particle trajectories (characteristics) in phase space. This is a manifestation of Liouville's theorem for the single-particle distribution function and implies that the dynamics are time-reversible and Hamiltonian.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\nThis statement claims that the fine-grained entropy $S=-\\int \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}v\\, f\\ln f$ is conserved, and that Landau damping is a process of phase mixing that transfers energy from the field to fine-scale kinetic structures without true irreversibility.\n\n1.  **Entropy Conservation:** The time rate of change of the entropy functional $S$ is\n    $$\n    \\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\int f\\ln f \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}v = -\\int (1+\\ln f) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}v\n    $$\n    Substituting $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}$ from the Vlasov equation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dS}{dt} = \\int (1+\\ln f) \\left( v \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{qE}{m} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}v\n    $$\n    We can write $(1+\\ln f)\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\xi} = \\frac{\\partial (f\\ln f)}{\\partial \\xi}$. Integrating by parts with respect to $x$ and $v$ and assuming that $f$ vanishes at the boundaries of the phase space domain gives zero, as $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial v}=0$. Thus, $\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$. The fine-grained Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is indeed conserved in Vlasov dynamics.\n\n2.  **Landau Damping Mechanism:** Landau damping is the decay of the macroscopic electric field in a collisionless plasma. It occurs because of resonant energy exchange between the wave and particles with velocities close to the wave's phase velocity. Particles slightly slower than the wave are accelerated, gaining energy from the wave, while particles slightly faster are decelerated, giving energy to the wave. For a stable distribution (like a Maxwellian), there are more slower particles than faster ones, leading to a net transfer of energy from the wave to the particles. Microscopically, this is due to phase mixing: particles with different velocities stream at different rates, leading to the smearing out of any large-scale spatial perturbation into ever-finer structures in velocity space.\n\n3.  **Energy Transfer and Irreversibility:** The total energy of the system (particle kinetic energy + electric field energy) is conserved. Landau damping is a redistribution of this energy from the macroscopic field into the kinetic energy of microscopic velocity-space structures. Because the underlying dynamics are reversible and entropy is conserved, this process is not thermodynamically irreversible. The information about the wave is not lost but is stored in the fine-grained details of the distribution function. The existence of plasma echoes, which recover this information, is experimental proof of this reversibility.\n\nAll parts of statement A are consistent with modern plasma theory.\n\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThis statement claims that plasma echoes require collisional scattering and thus cannot occur in a collisionless Vlasov-Poisson system.\n\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The plasma echo is a hallmark phenomenon of *collisionless*, time-reversible dynamics. It demonstrates that the information seemingly \"lost\" during Landau damping is merely hidden in phase-space correlations and can be recovered. The echo is generated by the non-linear interaction of two perturbations, which manipulates the phase-space filaments in such a way that they rephase at a later time, producing a macroscopic signal.\n\nCollisions, which introduce true irreversibility, act to *destroy* the echo phenomenon. Collisional processes like diffusion in velocity space would smear out the fine-scale filaments, erasing the memory required for the rephasing to occur. Therefore, echoes are most pronounced in a strictly collisionless system.\n\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThis statement describes the formation of a plasma echo as a result of a kinematic phase-cancellation condition.\n\nLet's consider the phase evolution of perturbations. The first pulse at $t=0$ with wavenumber $k_1$ creates a velocity modulation in the distribution function, which then evolves as $\\exp(i k_1 (x-vt))$. At time $t_1$, this perturbation has a phase factor related to $\\exp(-i k_1 v t_1)$ for a particle with velocity $v$.\nThe second pulse at $t=t_1$ with wavenumber $k_2$ creates another perturbation. The echo arises from the non-linear interaction. A simplified picture follows the phase information carried by particles. A particle's phase is modulated by $\\exp(i k_1 x)$ at $t=0$ and by $\\exp(i k_2 x)$ at $t=t_1$.\nThe echo appears at a later time $t_e  t_1$ and a wavenumber $k_e$. The dominant echo typically forms at $k_e = k_2 - k_1$. The formation of a macroscopic signal requires that the phase contributions from particles of all velocities add up constructively. This means the total velocity-dependent phase must be zero.\n\nThe velocity-dependent phase acquired by the $k_1$ component up to time $t_e$ is $-k_1 v t_e$. The phase acquired by the $k_2$ component from $t_1$ to $t_e$ is $+k_2 v (t_e - t_1)$. The echo forms when the sum of these phases is independent of $v$:\n$$\n\\phi_v = -k_1 v t_e + k_2 v (t_e - t_1)\n$$\nFor this to be independent of $v$, the coefficient of $v$ must be zero:\n$$\n-k_1 t_e + k_2 (t_e - t_1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(k_2 - k_1) t_e = k_2 t_1\n$$\n$$\nt_e = t_1 \\frac{k_2}{k_2 - k_1}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the echo time $t_e$ and wavenumber $k_e = k_2 - k_1$ are determined by a purely kinematic condition of phase cancellation. The statement correctly describes this principle.\n\n**Verdict for C: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThis statement asserts that the microscopic entropy $S=-\\int \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}v\\, f\\ln f$ must increase monotonically during Landau damping, even in a collisionless system.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction of a fundamental property of the Vlasov equation. As demonstrated in the analysis of option A, the time derivative of the fine-grained Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is exactly zero ($\\frac{dS}{dt}=0$) for any evolution governed by the Vlasov equation. Entropy increase is the signature of irreversible, collisional processes, which are explicitly excluded from this system. The Vlasov equation is time-reversible. The concept of an \"arrow of time\" based on entropy increase does not apply to the microscopic, reversible dynamics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. An apparent arrow of time can emerge from \"coarse-graining\" the distribution function, but the statement refers to the microscopic entropy $S$, which is conserved.\n\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3725748"}, {"introduction": "While linear theory provides an essential description of small-amplitude waves, many phenomena in fusion and space plasmas involve large-amplitude waves where nonlinear effects dominate.

Let us analyze the motion of a trapped electron near one of these minima, for instance, the one at $x'=0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the dynamics of small-amplitude oscillations. This implies that the electron's displacement from the equilibrium position $x'=0$ is small, such that $|kx'| \\ll 1$. We can therefore use the Taylor expansion for $\\sin(kx')$ around $x'=0$:\n$$\n\\sin(kx') \\approx kx'\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the equation of motion yields:\n$$\nm_e \\frac{d^2 x'}{dt^2} \\approx -ek\\phi_{0} (kx') = -(ek^2\\phi_{0})x'\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 x'}{dt^2} + \\left( \\frac{ek^2\\phi_{0}}{m_e} \\right) x' = 0\n$$\nThis is the canonical equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, $\\ddot{x} + \\omega^2 x = 0$. By comparing the two forms, we identify the square of the angular frequency of oscillation, which is the bounce frequency $\\omega_{b}$ for deeply trapped electrons.\n$$\n\\omega_{b}^2 = \\frac{ek^2\\phi_{0}}{m_e}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the final expression for the bounce frequency:\n$$\n\\omega_{b} = \\sqrt{\\frac{ek^2\\phi_{0}}{m_e}} = k \\sqrt{\\frac{e\\phi_{0}}{m_e}}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n- Wave number, $k = 2.5 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- Potential amplitude, $\\phi_{0} = 15 \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- Electron mass, $m_{e} = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term under the square root:\n$$\n\\frac{e\\phi_{0}}{m_e} = \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}) \\times (15 \\ \\mathrm{V})}{9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 2.63821 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}\n$$\nNext, we take the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{e\\phi_{0}}{m_e}} \\approx \\sqrt{2.63821 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}} \\approx 1.624257 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\nFinally, we multiply by the wave number $k$:\n$$\n\\omega_{b} = k \\sqrt{\\frac{e\\phi_{0}}{m_e}} \\approx (2.5 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (1.624257 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{m/s})\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{b} \\approx 4.0606425 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\n\\omega_{b} \\approx 4.061 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.061 \\times 10^{9}}$$", "id": "3725749"}]}
