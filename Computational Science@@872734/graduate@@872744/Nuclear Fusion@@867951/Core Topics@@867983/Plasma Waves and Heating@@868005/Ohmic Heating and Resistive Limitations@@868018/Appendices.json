We use cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate, $\\theta$ is the poloidal (azimuthal) angle, and $\\phi$ corresponds to the toroidal (axial) direction. Axisymmetry implies that all quantities are independent of the poloidal angle $\\theta$, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.

In cylindrical coordinates, the curl of a vector field $\\mathbf{A} = A_r\\hat{r} + A_{\\theta}\\hat{\\theta} + A_{\\phi}\\hat{\\phi}$ is:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial A_{\\phi}}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{\\partial A_{\\theta}}{\\partial \\phi}\\right)\\hat{r} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial A_r}{\\partial \\phi} - \\frac{\\partial A_{\\phi}}{\\partial r}\\right) \\hat{\\theta} + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\partial(r A_{\\theta})}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial A_r}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)\\hat{\\phi} $$\nFor $\\mathbf{E} = E_{\\phi}(r,t)\\hat{\\phi}$, with axisymmetry ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}=0$) and the straight cylinder approximation ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}=0$), this simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial E_{\\phi}}{\\partial r} \\hat{\\theta} $$\nSubstituting this into Faraday's law:\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial E_{\\phi}}{\\partial r} \\hat{\\theta} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial E_{\\phi}}{\\partial r} \\hat{\\theta} $$\nThis indicates that the changing electric field induces a time-varying poloidal magnetic field, $\\mathbf{B} = B_{\\theta}(r,t)\\hat{\\theta}$, which is consistent with the physics of a toroidal current.\n\nNext, we apply Ampère's law to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B_{\\theta}(r,t)\\hat{\\theta}$.

Thus, the characteristic length scale is $L=a$. The resistive relaxation time $\\tau_{R}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\tau_{R} = \\frac{a^2}{D} = \\frac{\\mu_0 a^2}{\\eta} $$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculation of $\\tau_{R}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Minor radius: $a = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Resistivity: $\\eta = 10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- The vacuum permeability is a physical constant: $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H}/\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\tau_{R}$:\n$$ \\tau_{R} = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}) (0.5\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ \\tau_{R} = \\frac{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 0.25}{10^{-7}} \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ \\tau_{R} = 4\\pi \\times 0.25 \\,\\mathrm{s} = \\pi \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures:\n$$ \\tau_{R} \\approx 3.14\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n\n### Step 4: Comparison and Justification\n\nWe are asked to compare the calculated resistive time $\\tau_R$ with the given energy confinement time $\\tau_{E} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Resistive time: $\\tau_R \\approx 3.14\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Energy confinement time: $\\tau_E = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe comparison shows that $\\tau_{R} \\gg \\tau_{E}$. Specifically, $\\tau_{R}$ is more than $30$ times larger than $\\tau_{E}$.\n\nThe physical meaning of this inequality is that the characteristic time scale for the evolution of the plasma current profile due to resistivity is much longer than the characteristic time scale for the evolution of the plasma's thermal energy (i.e., its temperature and density profiles). Therefore, when studying phenomena that occur on the energy transport timescale (like heat loss from the plasma core), the current profile can be assumed to be stationary or \"frozen\" in place.

The derivation is to be based on a first-principles force balance for electrons in a plasma.\n\nThe physical principle stipulated is the balance between the accelerating force from a parallel electric field and the collisional friction (drag) force. The onset of primary runaway generation, which the Dreicer field characterizes, occurs when the electric force is sufficient to overcome the collisional drag on electrons. The problem specifies that this balance should be considered for electrons moving at the characteristic thermal speed.\n\nFirst, let us define the forces involved. An electron with elementary charge $-e$ in a parallel electric field $E_{\\parallel}$ experiences an electric force of magnitude:\n$$F_E = e E_{\\parallel}$$\n\nNext, we establish the collisional friction force, $F_{coll}$, experienced by an electron moving through the plasma. This force arises from the cumulative effect of small-angle Coulomb collisions with background electrons and ions. For an electron moving at a speed $v$ significantly greater than the thermal speed of the ions ($v \\gg v_{th,i}$) but comparable to the thermal speed of the electrons ($v \\sim v_{th,e}$), the friction force is the sum of drag from collisions with ions and with other electrons. A standard model for the drag force on a fast test particle in a plasma is given by:\n$$F_{coll}(v) = F_{e/i}(v) + F_{e/e}(v)$$\nFor a fully ionized deuterium plasma, the ions are deuterons (D$^+$), with charge number $Z_i = 1$.

While a more precise treatment involves the Chandrasekhar function to account for the velocity distribution of the background electrons, the problem's directive to use \"first principles\" and evaluate at the thermal speed suggests a simplified, yet physically motivated, model.

Substituting the relaxation form gives\n$$\nC = 1 + \\left(F_{\\infty} - 1\\right)\\left[1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t_{q_{0}=1}}{\\tau_{R}}\\right)\\right].\n$$\nSolving for $\\exp\\!\\left(-t_{q_{0}=1}/\\tau_{R}\\right)$,\n$$\nC - 1 = \\left(F_{\\infty} - 1\\right)\\left[1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t_{q_{0}=1}}{\\tau_{R}}\\right)\\right]\n\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t_{q_{0}=1}}{\\tau_{R}}\\right) = \\frac{C - 1}{F_{\\infty} - 1}.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\n\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t_{q_{0}=1}}{\\tau_{R}}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{C - 1}{F_{\\infty} - 1},\n$$\nand\n$$\nt_{q_{0}=1} = -\\tau_{R}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{C - 1}{F_{\\infty} - 1}\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ and $F_{\\infty}$,\n$$\nC = \\frac{2 B_{t} \\pi a^{2}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}}, \\qquad F_{\\infty} - 1 = \\frac{2}{2 - \\alpha} - 1 = \\frac{\\alpha}{2 - \\alpha}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nt_{q_{0}=1} = -\\tau_{R}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(1 - (C - 1)\\,\\frac{2 - \\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)\n= -\\tau_{R}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{2 - \\alpha}{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{2 B_{t} \\pi a^{2}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}} - 1\\right)\\right).\n$$\n\nExistence and physical consistency conditions:\n- Since $F(t)$ increases monotonically from $1$ to $F_{\\infty}$, the crossing $F(t) = C$ occurs only if $1 \\leq C \\leq F_{\\infty}$. Thus, the condition for $q_{0}$ to reach $1$ in finite time is\n$$\n1 \\leq \\frac{2 B_{t} \\pi a^{2}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}} \\leq \\frac{2}{2 - \\alpha}.\n$$\nIf $\\frac{2 B_{t} \\pi a^{2}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}} < 1$, then $q_{0}(0) < 1$ and the crossing has already occurred at $t=0$. If $\\frac{2 B_{t} \\pi a^{2}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}} > \\frac{2}{2 - \\alpha}$, then the stationary peaking is insufficient to reduce $q_{0}$ to $1$, and the crossing does not occur in this model.\n\nSensitivity to edge resistivity:\nThe resistive diffusion time is $\\tau_{R} = \\mu_{0} a^{2}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}$. Treating $\\alpha$ and the geometric and magnetic parameters as fixed, the only explicit dependence of $t_{q_{0}=1}$ on $\\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}$ is through $\\tau_{R}$. Thus,\n$$\nt_{q_{0}=1}(\\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}) = -\\frac{\\mu_{0} a^{2}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}} \\,\\ln\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{2 - \\alpha}{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{2 B_{t} \\pi a^{2}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}} - 1\\right)\\right),\n$$\nand the sensitivity is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial t_{q_{0}=1}}{\\partial \\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}}\\left(-\\frac{\\mu_{0} a^{2}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}}\\right)\\ln(\\cdots) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} a^{2}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}^{2}}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{2 - \\alpha}{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{2 B_{t} \\pi a^{2}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}} - 1\\right)\\right).\n$$\nUnder the crossing condition, the logarithm is nonpositive (equal to zero only in the asymptotic limit), so\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial t_{q_{0}=1}}{\\partial \\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}} \\leq 0,\n$$\nmeaning that increasing edge resistivity reduces the time to reach $q_{0}=1$ by shortening the resistive diffusion time. The magnitude of the sensitivity scales as $\\eta_{\\mathrm{edge}}^{-2}$ times the absolute value of the logarithmic factor, which is set by how far the required peaking $C$ lies below the stationary peaking $F_{\\infty}$.\n\nIn summary, the closed-form expression for the crossing time is obtained from first principles and the specified resistive-relaxation model, with clear physical conditions for its applicability and explicit dependence on edge resistivity through the resistive diffusion time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\tau_{R}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{2 - \\alpha}{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{2 B_{t} \\pi a^{2}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}} - 1\\right)\\right)}$$", "id": "3711991"}]}
