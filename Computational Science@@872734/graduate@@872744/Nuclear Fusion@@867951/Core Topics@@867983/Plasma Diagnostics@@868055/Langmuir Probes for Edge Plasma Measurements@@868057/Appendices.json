Derivation of the Electron Current $I_e(V)$\n\nFor a Maxwellian plasma, the electron velocity distribution function $f(\\mathbf{v})$ is given by:\n$$ f(\\mathbf{v}) = n_e \\left(\\frac{m_e}{2\\pi k_B T_e}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_e (v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nwhere $n_e$ is the electron density, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_e$ is the electron temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe probe is a planar surface. Let the $z$-axis be normal to the probe surface. The electron current density $J_e$ to the probe is the charge flux. An electron with velocity component $v_z$ can only reach the probe if its kinetic energy associated with this component is sufficient to overcome the retarding potential energy barrier $e(V_p - V)$, where $V  V_p$. The condition is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}m_e v_z^2 \\geq e(V_p - V) $$\nThis defines a minimum velocity in the $z$-direction, $v_{z,min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2e(V_p - V)}{m_e}}$.\n\nThe flux of electrons reaching the probe, $\\Gamma_e$, is found by integrating $v_z f(\\mathbf{v})$ over all possible velocities for particles that can reach the collector:\n$$ \\Gamma_e = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_y \\int_{v_{z,min}}^{\\infty} v_z f(\\mathbf{v}) dv_z $$\nSubstituting the Maxwellian distribution:\n$$ \\Gamma_e = n_e \\left(\\frac{m_e}{2\\pi k_B T_e}\\right)^{3/2} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{m_e v_x^2}{2k_B T_e}} dv_x \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{m_e v_y^2}{2k_B T_e}} dv_y \\right) \\left( \\int_{v_{z,min}}^{\\infty} v_z e^{-\\frac{m_e v_z^2}{2k_B T_e}} dv_z \\right) $$\nThe first two integrals are standard Gaussian integrals, each evaluating to $\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T_e}{m_e}}$. Their product is $\\frac{2\\pi k_B T_e}{m_e}$.\nThe third integral is solved by substitution. Let $u = \\frac{m_e v_z^2}{2k_B T_e}$, so $du = \\frac{m_e v_z}{k_B T_e} dv_z$. The lower integration limit becomes $u_{min} = \\frac{m_e v_{z,min}^2}{2k_B T_e} = \\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}$.\n$$ \\int_{v_{z,min}}^{\\infty} v_z e^{-\\frac{m_e v_z^2}{2k_B T_e}} dv_z = \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e} \\int_{\\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}}^{\\infty} e^{-u} du = \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e} \\left[-e^{-u}\\right]_{\\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}}^{\\infty} = \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nCombining these results:\n$$ \\Gamma_e = n_e \\left(\\frac{m_e}{2\\pi k_B T_e}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T_e}{m_e}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ \\Gamma_e = n_e \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{2\\pi m_e}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nThe electron current $I_e$ is the elementary charge $e$ multiplied by the flux $\\Gamma_e$ and the probe area $A$:\n$$ I_e(V) = e A \\Gamma_e = e A n_e \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{2\\pi m_e}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nThe term multiplying the exponential is the electron saturation current, $I_{e,sat}$, which is collected when $V \\geq V_p$ (i.e., when the retarding potential is zero or attractive).\n$$ I_{e,sat} = e A n_e \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{2\\pi m_e}} $$\nThus, the expression for the electron current in the retarding region ($V  V_p$) is:\n$$ I_e(V) = I_{e,sat} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\n\n#### 2. Calculation of Electron Temperature $T_e$\n\nTo find the temperature, we use the measured slope of the logarithm of the current. Taking the natural logarithm of the expression for $I_e(V)$:\n$$ \\ln I_e(V) = \\ln(I_{e,sat}) - \\frac{e(V_p - V)}{k_B T_e} = \\ln(I_{e,sat}) - \\frac{e V_p}{k_B T_e} + \\frac{e V}{k_B T_e} $$\nDifferentiating with respect to the probe bias $V$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln I_e)}{dV} = \\frac{e}{k_B T_e} $$\nIt is convenient to express the electron temperature in units of electronvolts, which we denote as $T_{e,eV}$. The relationship is $k_B T_e = e T_{e,eV}$. Substituting this into the slope expression gives a simple relation:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln I_e)}{dV} = \\frac{e}{e T_{e,eV}} = \\frac{1}{T_{e,eV}} $$\nThe problem provides the measured slope as $\\frac{d(\\ln I_e)}{dV} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{V^{-1}}$. Therefore:\n$$ T_{e,eV} = \\left(\\frac{d(\\ln I_e)}{dV}\\right)^{-1} = (0.4\\,\\mathrm{V^{-1}})^{-1} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nSo, the electron temperature is $T_e = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Rounded to three significant figures, this is $2.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n#### 3. Calculation of Electron Density $n_e$\n\nFirst, we must determine the electron saturation current $I_{e,sat}$. We are given that $I_e = 10\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ at a bias $V = V_p - 2\\,\\mathrm{V}$, which means the potential difference $V_p - V = 2\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Using the derived current equation with $T_e$ in eV:\n$$ I_e(V) = I_{e,sat} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_p - V}{T_{e,eV}}\\right) $$\n$$ 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A} = I_{e,sat} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{V}}{2.5\\,\\mathrm{V}}\\right) = I_{e,sat} \\exp(-0.8) $$\nSolving for $I_{e,sat}$:\n$$ I_{e,sat} = (10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times \\exp(0.8) \\approx 10^{-2} \\times 2.22554\\,\\mathrm{A} \\approx 0.0222554\\,\\mathrm{A} $$\nNow we can use the definition of $I_{e,sat}$ to find the electron density $n_e$:\n$$ I_{e,sat} = e A n_e \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{2\\pi m_e}} = e A n_e \\sqrt{\\frac{e T_{e,eV}}{2\\pi m_e}} $$\nSolving for $n_e$:\n$$ n_e = \\frac{I_{e,sat}}{e A \\sqrt{\\frac{e T_{e,eV}}{2\\pi m_e}}} $$\nWe use the following values:\n- $I_{e,sat} \\approx 0.0222554\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $e \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $A = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm^2} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$\n- $T_{e,eV} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $m_e \\approx 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$\n\nLet's compute the terms:\nThe thermal velocity term is $\\sqrt{\\frac{e T_{e,eV}}{2\\pi m_e}}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times 2.5}{2\\pi \\times (9.109 \\times 10^{-31})}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{4.005 \\times 10^{-19}}{5.724 \\times 10^{-30}}} \\approx \\sqrt{6.999 \\times 10^{10}}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 2.646 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} $$\nNow we compute $n_e$:\n$$ n_e = \\frac{0.0222554}{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (2.646 \\times 10^5)} $$\n$$ n_e = \\frac{0.0222554}{4.239 \\times 10^{-20}} \\approx 5.249 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the electron density is $n_e = 5.25 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$.\n\nThe final results are $T_e = 2.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $n_e = 5.25 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 2.50  5.25 \\times 10^{17} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3706662"}, {"introduction": "Moving from idealized analysis to real-world application, this problem addresses the practical challenges of deploying probes in a high-power fusion environment.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the ion-saturation current, $I_{sat,i}$, collected by the Langmuir probe. This current is measured when the probe is biased to a sufficiently large negative potential relative to the plasma potential, such that it repels virtually all electrons and collects an ion current limited by the flux of ions from the plasma.\n\nThe total current to the probe is the product of the probe's collecting area, $A$, and the ion-saturation current density, $j_{sat,i}$.\n$$I_{sat,i} = A \\cdot j_{sat,i}$$\nThe probe face is circular with radius $r$, so its area is $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe ion-saturation current density is given by the flux of ions to the probe surface. This flux, $\\Gamma_i$, is the product of the ion number density at the sheath edge, $n_{se}$, and the velocity with which ions enter the sheath, $v_{se}$. The current density is this flux multiplied by the elementary charge $e$ (since ions are singly ionized, $Z=1$).\n$$j_{sat,i} = e \\cdot \\Gamma_i = e \\cdot n_{se} \\cdot v_{se}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, we assume the density at the sheath entrance is equal to the upstream electron density, so $n_{se} = n_e$.\n\nThe **Bohm criterion** states that for a stable sheath to form, ions must be accelerated in a pre-sheath and enter the sheath with a velocity at least equal to the ion sound speed, $c_s$. In the limit of cold ions ($T_i \\ll T_e$), which is a standard simplification, the ion sound speed is given by:\n$$c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}}$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_e$ is the electron temperature in Kelvin, and $m_i$ is the ion mass. The ion velocity at the sheath edge is therefore taken as the Bohm velocity, $v_{se} = c_s$.\n\nCombining these expressions, the ion-saturation current is:\n$$I_{sat,i} = (\\pi r^2) \\cdot e \\cdot n_e \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}}$$\n\nNow, we will substitute the given numerical values. First, we must ensure all units are in the SI system. The electron temperature is given in electron-volts ($eV$), which must be converted to Joules. The quantity $k_B T_e$ in Joules can be found by multiplying the temperature in $eV$ by the elementary charge $e$.\n$$k_B T_e = (20\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) = 3.204 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe ion is deuterium ($D^+$), so its mass $m_i$ is the mass of a deuteron, which is approximately twice the proton mass $m_p$.\n$$m_i = 2 m_p = 2 \\times (1.67 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 3.34 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\nThe other parameters are:\n-   $n_e = 5 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n-   $r = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Bohm velocity (the ion sound speed):\n$$v_{Bohm} = c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.204 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{3.34 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx \\sqrt{9.5928 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^2}} \\approx 30972\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nNext, we calculate the probe area:\n$$A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = \\pi \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$$\nFinally, we compute the ion-saturation current:\n$$I_{sat,i} = A \\cdot e \\cdot n_e \\cdot v_{Bohm}$$\n$$I_{sat,i} = (\\pi \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (30972\\,\\mathrm{m/s})$$\nThe product of $e$ and $n_e$ is:\n$$e \\cdot n_e = (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) = 8.01\\,\\mathrm{C/m^3}$$\nNow, multiplying all terms:\n$$I_{sat,i} = (\\pi \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (8.01) \\times (30972)\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n$$I_{sat,i} \\approx (3.14159 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 248086\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n$$I_{sat,i} \\approx 0.77936\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$I_{sat,i} \\approx 0.779\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n\n**Assessment of Diagnostic Feasibility**\nThe calculated current magnitude, approximately $0.78\\,\\mathrm{A}$, is well within the measurement range of typical laboratory power supplies and source-measure units. However, the thermal load on the probe must be considered. The power deposited is $P = I V$. Assuming a bias voltage of $V_{bias} = -100\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to ensure saturation, the power load would be $P \\approx 0.779\\,\\mathrm{A} \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{V} = 77.9\\,\\mathrm{W}$. This power is deposited onto a very small area of $A \\approx 3.14\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}$. The resulting heat flux would be $q = P/A \\approx 77.9\\,\\mathrm{W} / (3.14 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) \\approx 24.8\\,\\mathrm{MW/m^2}$. This is an extremely high heat flux, comparable to that on a tokamak divertor, and poses a significant risk of melting or damaging the probe tip if biased continuously.

The electron saturation current is $I_{e,sat} = A_{eff} j_{e,th}$, where $A_{eff}$ is the effective collection area of the probe tip and $j_{e,th}$ is the electron thermal current density from the plasma.\n\nThe problem states that the measured currents $I_1 = 8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ and $I_2 = 5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ are the net electron currents for two tips, designated tip $1$ and tip $2$. Let their potentials relative to the plasma potential be $V_1 = V_{p1} - V_{pl}$ and $V_2 = V_{p2} - V_{pl}$. The currents can be written as:\n$$I_1 = A_1 j_{e,th} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e V_1}{k_B T_e^{\\text{K}}}\\right)$$\n$$I_2 = A_2 j_{e,th} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e V_2}{k_B T_e^{\\text{K}}}\\right)$$\nThe problem specifies to assume identical effective collection areas, so $A_1 = A_2$. The two tips are biased such that their potential difference is $\\Delta V = V_{p1} - V_{p2} = 10\\,\\mathrm{V}$. This also means the difference in their potentials relative to the plasma is $V_1 - V_2 = (V_{p1} - V_{pl}) - (V_{p2} - V_{pl}) = \\Delta V$.\n\nTo derive the electron temperature, we take the ratio of the two currents. This conveniently cancels the pre-exponential factors, which depend on plasma density, temperature, and probe geometry.\n$$\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\frac{A_1 j_{e,th} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e V_1}{k_B T_e^{\\text{K}}}\\right)}{A_2 j_{e,th} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e V_2}{k_B T_e^{\\text{K}}}\\right)} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e(V_1 - V_2)}{k_B T_e^{\\text{K}}}\\right)$$\nWith $A_1 = A_2$ and $V_1 - V_2 = \\Delta V$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{e \\Delta V}{k_B T_e^{\\text{K}}}\\right)$$\nTo solve for the temperature, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_1}{I_2}\\right) = \\frac{e \\Delta V}{k_B T_e^{\\text{K}}}$$\nRearranging for $T_e^{\\text{K}}$ gives:\n$$T_e^{\\text{K}} = \\frac{e \\Delta V}{k_B \\ln(I_1/I_2)}$$\nThe problem asks for the temperature in electronvolts (eV). The electron temperature in eV, which we will denote as $T_e$, is related to the temperature in Kelvin by $T_e = k_B T_e^{\\text{K}} / e$. Substituting this relationship into the expression:\n$$\\frac{e T_e}{k_B} = \\frac{e \\Delta V}{k_B \\ln(I_1/I_2)}$$\nCanceling the factor of $e/k_B$ from both sides yields the desired expression for the electron temperature in electronvolts:\n$$T_e = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\ln(I_1/I_2)}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data: $I_1 = 8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, $I_2 = 5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, and $\\Delta V = 10\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$T_e = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{V}}{\\ln(8\\,\\mathrm{mA} / 5\\,\\mathrm{mA})} = \\frac{10}{\\ln(1.6)}$$\n$$T_e \\approx \\frac{10}{0.4700036} \\approx 21.2764\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the electron temperature is $21.3\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nNext, we perform a sensitivity analysis on this result.\n\n**1. Unequal Effective Collection Areas**\n\nLet the effective collection areas be unequal, such that their ratio is $A_1 / A_2 = \\alpha$. The ratio of currents becomes:\n$$\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\alpha \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V}{T_e}\\right)$$\nAn experimenter, assuming $\\alpha=1$, would calculate an inferred temperature, let's call it $T'_e$:\n$$T'_e = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\ln(I_1/I_2)} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\ln\\left(\\alpha \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V}{T_e}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\ln(\\alpha) + \\frac{\\Delta V}{T_e}}$$\n$$T'_e = T_e \\left(\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\ln(\\alpha) T_e + \\Delta V}\\right) = \\frac{T_e}{1 + \\frac{T_e}{\\Delta V}\\ln(\\alpha)}$$\n**Qualitatively:**\n- If $\\alpha  1$ (e.g., tip $1$ has a larger area), then $\\ln(\\alpha)  0$, and the denominator is greater than $1$. Thus, $T'_e  T_e$. The temperature is underestimated. A larger current ratio is incorrectly attributed to a colder, more responsive plasma rather than to the area mismatch.\n- If $\\alpha  1$ (e.g., tip $1$ has a smaller area), then $\\ln(\\alpha)  0$, and the denominator is less than $1$. Thus, $T'_e  T_e$. The temperature is overestimated.\n\n**Quantitatively (to first order):**\nWe assume the mismatch is small, so $\\alpha$ is close to $1$. Let $\\alpha = 1 + \\epsilon_A$, where $|\\epsilon_A| \\ll 1$. We use the first-order approximation $\\ln(1 + \\epsilon_A) \\approx \\epsilon_A$.\n$$T'_e \\approx \\frac{T_e}{1 + \\frac{T_e}{\\Delta V}\\epsilon_A}$$\nUsing the approximation $(1+x)^{-1} \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$, where $x = \\frac{T_e}{\\Delta V}\\epsilon_A$:\n$$T'_e \\approx T_e \\left(1 - \\frac{T_e}{\\Delta V}\\epsilon_A\\right)$$\nThe fractional error in the inferred temperature is:\n$$\\frac{T'_e - T_e}{T_e} \\approx -\\frac{T_e}{\\Delta V}\\epsilon_A = -(\\alpha-1)\\frac{T_e}{\\Delta V}$$\nThe error is amplified by the factor $T_e/\\Delta V$. In this case, the factor is approximately $21.3/10 = 2.13$.\n\n**2. Unknown Additive Voltage Offset**\n\nLet there be an unknown voltage offset $\\delta V$ such that the true potential difference is $\\Delta V' = \\Delta V - \\delta V$. The current ratio is determined by this true potential difference:\n$$\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V'}{T_e}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V - \\delta V}{T_e}\\right)$$\nThe experimenter, unaware of $\\delta V$, calculates an inferred temperature, let's call it $T''_e$, using the nominal voltage $\\Delta V$:\n$$T''_e = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\ln(I_1/I_2)} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{(\\Delta V - \\delta V)/T_e} = T_e \\left(\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta V - \\delta V}\\right) = \\frac{T_e}{1 - \\delta V/\\Delta V}$$\n**Qualitatively:**\n- If $\\delta V  0$ (the true voltage separation is smaller than assumed), then the denominator is less than $1$, so $T''_e  T_e$. The temperature is overestimated. The measured current ratio, achieved with a smaller-than-assumed voltage, is incorrectly attributed to a hotter, less responsive plasma.\n- If $\\delta V  0$ (the true voltage separation is larger than assumed), then the denominator is greater than $1$, so $T''_e  T_e$. The temperature is underestimated.\n\n**Quantitatively (to first order):**\nWe assume the voltage offset is small, so $|\\delta V/\\Delta V| \\ll 1$. We use the approximation $(1-x)^{-1} \\approx 1+x$, where $x = \\delta V/\\Delta V$.\n$$T''_e \\approx T_e \\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta V}{\\Delta V}\\right)$$\nThe fractional error in the inferred temperature is:\n$$\\frac{T''_e - T_e}{T_e} \\approx \\frac{\\delta V}{\\Delta V}$$\nThe fractional error in temperature is directly proportional to the fractional error in the assumed voltage bias.\n\n**Approximations Used in Sensitivity Analysis:**\n\nThe quantitative sensitivity analysis relies on first-order Taylor series expansions, valid for small perturbations:\n1. For the area mismatch, we assumed $\\alpha = 1+\\epsilon_A$ with $|\\epsilon_A| \\ll 1$. This justified the approximations $\\ln(1+\\epsilon_A) \\approx \\epsilon_A$ and $(1+x)^{-1} \\approx 1-x$ where $x=\\frac{T_e}{\\Delta V}\\epsilon_A$. The second approximation also requires $|x| \\ll 1$.\n2. For the voltage offset, we assumed $|\\delta V / \\Delta V| \\ll 1$, which justified the approximation $(1 - \\delta V/\\Delta V)^{-1} \\approx 1 + \\delta V/\\Delta V$.\n\nThese approximations linearize the error response, providing a clear first-order estimate of the bias introduced by imperfections in the experimental setup.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{21.3}$$", "id": "3706704"}]}
