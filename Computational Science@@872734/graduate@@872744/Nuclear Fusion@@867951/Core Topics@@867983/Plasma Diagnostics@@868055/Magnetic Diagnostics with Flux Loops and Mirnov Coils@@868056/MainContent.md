## Introduction
Magnetic diagnostics are the eyes and ears of a [magnetic confinement fusion](@entry_id:180408) experiment, providing the essential, non-invasive measurements required to understand and control the superheated plasma within. Without them, the complex [magnetic structure](@entry_id:201216) and dynamic behavior of the plasma would remain largely inscrutable. This article addresses the fundamental need for robust plasma measurement by providing a deep dive into two of the most ubiquitous magnetic sensors: flux loops and Mirnov coils. By reading, you will gain a graduate-level understanding of how these seemingly simple wire coils are used to unlock profound insights into [plasma physics](@entry_id:139151), from [global equilibrium](@entry_id:148976) to microscopic instabilities.

The journey begins in **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** where we will establish the foundational physics of these sensors, starting from Faraday's law of induction. We will dissect how sensor geometry dictates their function, distinguishing between the global measurements of flux loops and the local measurements of Mirnov coils. Next, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** will showcase how these raw signals are transformed into actionable physical knowledge. We will explore their critical role in [equilibrium reconstruction](@entry_id:749060), real-time [plasma control](@entry_id:753487), and the identification of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, revealing connections to control theory, [computational physics](@entry_id:146048), and [inverse problem theory](@entry_id:750807). Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section will challenge you to apply these concepts to practical problems, reinforcing your understanding of signal processing, error analysis, and [filter design](@entry_id:266363) in a real-world diagnostic context.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Magnetic diagnostics are the cornerstone of understanding and controlling magnetically confined plasmas. Their operation, in its most fundamental form, relies on one of the pillars of classical electromagnetism: Faraday's law of induction. This chapter elucidates the principles and mechanisms governing the most common inductive sensors used in fusion research—flux loops and Mirnov coils—from first principles to the practical nuances of their design, deployment, and signal interpretation.

### The Unifying Principle: Faraday's Law of Induction

All passive magnetic pickup sensors, regardless of their specific geometry or intended application, operate on the principle of [electromagnetic induction](@entry_id:181154). Faraday's law, in its integral form, states that the [electromotive force](@entry_id:203175) (EMF), $V$, induced in a closed conducting loop is equal to the negative time rate of change of the magnetic flux, $\Phi_B$, passing through the surface bounded by the loop. For a coil constructed with $N$ turns of wire, the total induced voltage is the sum of the EMFs from each turn:

$$
V = -N \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
$$

where the magnetic flux $\Phi_B$ is the [surface integral](@entry_id:275394) of the magnetic field component normal to the loop's surface area $S$:

$$
\Phi_B = \iint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}
$$

A critical and immediate consequence of this law is that inductive sensors are inherently sensitive to *changes* in magnetic flux, not to static fields. Their native output signal is always proportional to a time derivative. Consequently, to measure a time-varying magnetic field $B(t)$ or flux $\Phi(t)$, the raw voltage signal must be integrated with respect to time. This fundamental characteristic dictates both the capabilities and the limitations of these diagnostics, particularly at very low frequencies where electronic integration becomes challenging.

### A Taxonomy of Inductive Sensors

While united by Faraday's law, inductive sensors are differentiated by their geometry, which is tailored to measure specific physical quantities. In the context of [fusion plasma diagnostics](@entry_id:749659), three archetypes are prevalent [@problem_id:3707825].

A **[flux loop](@entry_id:749488)** is a large-area conductor designed to measure the rate of change of the total magnetic flux, $d\Phi/dt$, integrated over a macroscopic surface. For instance, a [poloidal flux](@entry_id:753562) loop encircles the entire plasma cross-section and is used to measure the change in the total poloidal magnetic flux generated by the plasma current and external shaping coils. These measurements are essential for determining [global equilibrium](@entry_id:148976) properties like plasma position, shape, and safety factor, which evolve on relatively slow timescales. Their useful bandwidth typically ranges from fractions of a hertz to several kilohertz, limited at the high end by eddy current shielding and at the low end by the performance of the electronic integrator.

A **Mirnov coil**, also known as a magnetic pickup coil, is a small-area coil designed to measure the rate of change of the *local* magnetic field, $d\mathbf{B}/dt$. Because its area $A$ is small, the flux through it is well-approximated by $\Phi_B \approx B_{\perp} A$, where $B_{\perp}$ is the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the coil's winding plane. Its induced voltage is therefore $V \approx -NA \frac{dB_{\perp}}{dt}$. These coils are the primary tools for studying high-frequency magnetic oscillations associated with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, such as [tearing modes](@entry_id:194294), [edge localized modes](@entry_id:748795) (ELMs), and Alfvén [eigenmodes](@entry_id:174677). Their operational bandwidth is correspondingly wide, often spanning from tens of hertz to over a megahertz.

A **Rogowski coil** is a specialized sensor designed to measure the rate of change of a total electrical current, $dI/dt$. It consists of a helical winding on a non-magnetic toroidal former that completely encircles the current to be measured (e.g., the [plasma current](@entry_id:182365) or the current in a field coil). By combining Faraday's law with Ampère's circuital law, it can be shown that the induced voltage is directly proportional to $dI/dt$. Like all inductive sensors, it requires integration to recover the current $I(t)$ and cannot measure a direct current (DC).

### Global versus Local Measurements: The Role of Spatial Integration

The crucial distinction between a [flux loop](@entry_id:749488) and a Mirnov coil lies in the spatial scale of their measurement [@problem_id:3707808]. A [flux loop](@entry_id:749488), by integrating the magnetic field over a large surface $S$, performs a spatial average. Its signal, $V_{loop} = -d/dt (\int_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A})$, is dominated by large-scale, coherent phenomena that produce a net change in flux over the entire surface. This makes it an ideal instrument for diagnosing macroscopic equilibrium parameters. Conversely, it is relatively insensitive to small-scale fluctuations, especially those with an oscillating spatial structure, as their positive and negative contributions to the [flux integral](@entry_id:138365) tend to cancel out.

A Mirnov coil, in contrast, provides a point measurement. Its signal, $V_{coil} \approx -NA \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}_0) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}})$, is sensitive to any local magnetic field fluctuation at its position $\mathbf{r}_0$. This locality is precisely what makes it invaluable for fluctuation analysis. Even if a particular MHD mode produces zero net change in flux over a large area, a Mirnov coil placed at a location of high field perturbation will register a strong signal. By arranging Mirnov coils in poloidal and toroidal arrays, one can measure the phase relationships between the signals at different locations. This allows for the experimental determination of the poloidal ($m$) and toroidal ($n$) mode numbers that characterize the spatial structure of MHD instabilities, providing deep insight into [plasma dynamics](@entry_id:185550).

This [spatial filtering](@entry_id:202429) property can be analyzed more formally. Consider a [flux loop](@entry_id:749488) that runs poloidally around the entire circumference of a tokamak at a fixed toroidal angle, designed to measure the toroidal magnetic flux [@problem_id:3707858]. Any magnetic field perturbation $\delta B_\phi$ can be decomposed into a Fourier series in the poloidal angle $\theta$. The total flux is found by integrating $\delta B_\phi(\theta)$ around the poloidal circumference. Due to the [orthogonality of trigonometric functions](@entry_id:143551), the integral of any mode with a poloidal mode number $m \neq 0$ over the full range $[0, 2\pi)$ is identically zero. Therefore, a perfectly constructed, poloidally symmetric loop is sensitive *only* to the axisymmetric ($m=0$) component of the field. In practice, small geometric asymmetries may introduce a minor, perturbative sensitivity to low-$m$ modes (e.g., $m=1$), but the loop remains profoundly insensitive to high-$m$ fluctuations. This inherent mode-filtering capability is a powerful design principle.

### Interpreting the Signal: Superposition and Vacuum Subtraction

A magnetic sensor installed on a fusion device does not measure the plasma's magnetic field in isolation. The total field $\mathbf{B}_{total}$ at any point is a linear superposition of the fields generated by all current sources present: the [plasma current](@entry_id:182365) $\mathbf{J}_{plasma}$, the currents in the external [poloidal field](@entry_id:188655) (PF) coils $\mathbf{I}_{PF}$, and the [eddy currents](@entry_id:275449) $\mathbf{J}_{eddy}$ induced in the conductive vacuum vessel and other structures.

The linearity of Maxwell's equations is a key principle that makes signal interpretation tractable [@problem_id:3707849]. Because the magnetic field is a linear superposition of the fields from each source ($\mathbf{B}_{total} = \mathbf{B}_{plasma} + \mathbf{B}_{PF} + \mathbf{B}_{eddy}$), and since flux is a linear integral of the field, the total magnetic flux is also a linear sum:

$$
\Phi_{total} = \Phi_{plasma} + \Phi_{PF} + \Phi_{eddy}
$$

As differentiation is also a linear operation, the voltage measured by a stationary [flux loop](@entry_id:749488) is the linear sum of the time derivatives of the flux contributions from each source:

$$
V_{loop}(t) = -\frac{d\Phi_{total}}{dt} = -\frac{d\Phi_{plasma}}{dt} -\frac{d\Phi_{PF}}{dt} -\frac{d\Phi_{eddy}}{dt}
$$

This principle of superposition is the foundation for a critical experimental technique: **vacuum calibration** or **vacuum subtraction**. To isolate the magnetic effects of the plasma, one can perform an identical discharge scenario *without* creating a plasma (a "vacuum shot"). During this shot, only the PF coils are energized. The [magnetic diagnostics](@entry_id:751608) then measure the combined response to the PF coil currents and the [eddy currents](@entry_id:275449) they induce in the vessel. This "vacuum signal" can be accurately modeled and subtracted from the total signal measured during a full plasma discharge, leaving, in principle, only the contribution from the plasma itself.

### Practical Considerations: From Ideal Theory to Real-World Performance

The ideal models presented thus far provide a foundational understanding. However, the performance of a real diagnostic is subject to a host of practical limitations and non-ideal effects.

#### Coil Construction and Sensitivity

The ideal sensitivity of a coil is proportional to its effective area-turns product, $NA_{eff}$. For a multi-turn coil with $N$ closely spaced, identical turns, the total induced voltage is simply $N$ times the voltage of a single turn, provided the magnetic field is uniform across the coil bundle and the coil behaves as a lumped element [@problem_id:3707788].

This simple scaling can be intentionally violated for specific diagnostic purposes. For example, by winding successive turns with alternating orientation (e.g., in a figure-8 pattern), a coil can be made sensitive to the spatial *gradient* of the magnetic field while rejecting uniform fields. In such a "gradiometer," the flux contributions from adjacent, oppositely-wound loops cancel in a uniform field, yielding zero net signal [@problem_id:3707788].

Furthermore, the assumption of a uniform field across the sensor's [aperture](@entry_id:172936) may not hold, leading to measurement corrections. If a rectangular [flux loop](@entry_id:749488) of radial width $w$ is placed in a field $B_n$ with a significant radial gradient $\partial B_n / \partial\xi$, the true flux will differ from the simple approximation of $\Phi = B_n(\xi_0) \times Area$. A Taylor expansion of the field across the loop width reveals that the leading-order correction to the flux is proportional to the gradient and the square of the width: $|\Phi_{corr}| = \frac{1}{2} L w^2 |\partial B_n / \partial \xi|$ [@problem_id:3707836]. For a loop with length $L=2.0\,\mathrm{m}$ and width $w=0.010\,\mathrm{m}$ in a gradient of $|\nabla B_n|=0.40\,\mathrm{T/m}$, this correction amounts to $40.00\,\mu\mathrm{Wb}$, a value that can be significant in high-precision equilibrium reconstructions.

#### Frequency-Dependent Limitations

The usable bandwidth of a magnetic diagnostic is bounded by both low- and high-frequency effects.

**Eddy Current Shielding:** The conductive vacuum vessel itself responds to changing magnetic fields. An external field change induces eddy currents in the vessel wall, which, by Lenz's law, create a magnetic field that opposes the external change. The vessel acts as a low-pass filter, shielding the interior from high-frequency fields [@problem_id:3707833]. The behavior can be modeled by a characteristic magnetic field penetration time, or "[wall time](@entry_id:756614)," $\tau_{wall} = \mu_0 \sigma d A / L$, where $\sigma$ and $d$ are the vessel wall's conductivity and thickness, and $A$ and $L$ describe the geometry of the eddy current path. The ratio of the internal field magnitude to the external field magnitude is given by the transfer function:

$$
R(\omega) = \frac{|B_{in}(\omega)|}{|B_{ext}(\omega)|} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (\omega\tau_{wall})^{2}}}
$$

For frequencies $\omega \ll 1/\tau_{wall}$, the field penetrates freely ($R \approx 1$). For frequencies $\omega \gg 1/\tau_{wall}$, the field is strongly screened ($R \approx 1/(\omega\tau_{wall})$). Any analysis of magnetic data, particularly for fast events, must account for this filtering effect of the vessel.

**System Bandwidth:** The full diagnostic chain, including the sensor and its processing electronics, has a finite bandwidth [@problem_id:3707865].
*   **Lower Cutoff Frequency:** As noted, recovering the magnetic field from the sensor's voltage requires integration. A pure electronic integrator is unstable and prone to drift. Practical integrators incorporate a large "leak" resistor in parallel with the feedback capacitor, creating an integrator time constant $\tau_{int} = R_f C_f$. This makes the circuit a [high-pass filter](@entry_id:274953) for the input voltage, which translates to a [low-pass filter](@entry_id:145200) for the reconstructed field. The response falls off at low frequencies, defining a lower [cutoff frequency](@entry_id:276383) $f_{low} = 1/(2\pi \tau_{int})$. For a system with $\tau_{int} = 2.0 \times 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}$, this limit is approximately $7.96\,\mathrm{Hz}$.
*   **Upper Cutoff Frequency:** The sensor itself imposes a high-frequency limit. A real coil possesses not only inductance $L$ but also [parasitic capacitance](@entry_id:270891) $C_p$ between its windings. At very high frequencies, this capacitance provides a low-impedance shunt path for the current, and the coil ceases to behave as a pure inductor. The frequency at which these capacitive effects become significant marks the upper cutoff. For a coil with $L = 2.5\,\mathrm{mH}$ and $C_p = 80\,\mathrm{pF}$, the frequency at which the capacitive impedance is ten times the [inductive reactance](@entry_id:272183) is about $1.13 \times 10^{5}\,\mathrm{Hz}$, setting a practical upper limit for reliable measurements. The range between $f_{low}$ and $f_{high}$ defines the usable bandwidth of the diagnostic system, which is in this case approximately $1.13 \times 10^{5}\,\mathrm{Hz}$.

#### Noise and Spurious Signals

Finally, measured signals are always contaminated by noise and spurious signals from non-magnetic sources.

**Electromagnetic Pickup:** The cables connecting the sensor to the [data acquisition](@entry_id:273490) system are themselves loops that can pick up stray, time-varying magnetic fields. This is a form of [common-mode noise](@entry_id:269684). To combat this, **[differential signaling](@entry_id:260727)** with **twisted-pair cables** is standard practice [@problem_id:3707804]. By twisting the two signal leads together, the loop area enclosed by the cable alternates its orientation on a small spatial scale (the twist pitch, $p$). In a [uniform magnetic field](@entry_id:263817), the flux picked up by one half-twist is nearly perfectly cancelled by the flux picked up in the next. This provides excellent rejection of noise from uniform fields. This technique is also highly effective against [gradient fields](@entry_id:264143). The net flux pickup in a twisted pair scales with the length $L$, whereas in a parallel-wire cable it accumulates more rapidly, scaling as $L^2$. The improvement in rejection for a cable of length $L=2.00\,\mathrm{m}$ and pitch $p=2.0 \times 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{m}$ can be quantified by the ratio of the induced voltages, which is $I = \pi L/p \approx 314$.

**Thermoelectric Voltages:** A significant source of DC or very low-frequency error can arise from the **Seebeck effect** [@problem_id:3707828]. In a fusion device, large temperature gradients exist between the hot in-vessel components and the cool ex-vessel environment. If the measurement circuit contains junctions of dissimilar metals (e.g., copper wire connected to a stainless steel feedthrough), a thermoelectric EMF will be generated. This voltage, given by $V_{te} = \int_{T_{cold}}^{T_{hot}} (S_A(T) - S_B(T)) dT$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the Seebeck coefficients of the two metals, appears as a constant or slowly drifting DC offset in the measurement. While small, this offset can be a major problem for measurements requiring long-[time integration](@entry_id:170891). For a copper-stainless steel junction between $T_{cold}=295\,\mathrm{K}$ and $T_{hot}=425\,\mathrm{K}$, the thermoelectric EMF can be on the order of millivolts. For a typical Mirnov coil, this spurious voltage can be equivalent to a magnetic field ramp of $\sim 5.67 \times 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{T/s}$. If the real magnetic signal of interest corresponds to a ramp of only $1.0 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{T/s}$, the thermoelectric error is almost 57 times larger than the signal, entirely dominating the measurement. Careful material selection, thermal design, and data correction techniques are therefore essential for high-fidelity [magnetic diagnostics](@entry_id:751608).
