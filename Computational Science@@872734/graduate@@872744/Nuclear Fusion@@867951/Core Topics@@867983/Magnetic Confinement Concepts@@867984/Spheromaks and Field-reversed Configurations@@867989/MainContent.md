## Introduction
In the quest for controlled [nuclear fusion](@entry_id:139312), a variety of [magnetic confinement](@entry_id:161852) concepts are being explored. Among the most promising alternatives to the conventional tokamak are the **[spheromak](@entry_id:755209)** and the **Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC)**. Both belong to the class of **compact tori (CTs)**, which are distinguished by a simply connected geometry free of a central magnetic coil linking the plasma torus. This architectural simplicity offers significant advantages for reactor engineering, potentially leading to more compact and cost-effective designs. However, this simplicity belies a rich and complex set of physical phenomena that govern their formation, stability, and confinement properties. Understanding the fundamental differences and unique characteristics of these two configurations is crucial for advancing their development as viable fusion energy sources.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of spheromaks and FRCs, structured to build a deep understanding from first principles to practical applications. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, delves into the core magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and kinetic theories that define these plasmas, contrasting the high-helicity, self-organized Taylor state of the [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) with the high-beta, kinetically-stabilized nature of the FRC. Following this theoretical foundation, the second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, explores how these principles are applied in experimental diagnostics, [plasma control](@entry_id:753487), stability analysis, and the [systems engineering](@entry_id:180583) of conceptual fusion power plants. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** offers a series of guided problems that allow you to apply these concepts to realistic scenarios, from calculating stability criteria to inferring plasma properties from experimental data. Together, these sections bridge the gap between abstract theory and applied [fusion science](@entry_id:182346).

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles and operational mechanisms of spheromaks and Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs). As two leading examples of the **compact torus (CT)**—a [toroidal plasma](@entry_id:202484) configuration free from any central conductors or vacuum vessel components linking the torus—spheromaks and FRCs share the engineering advantage of a simpler and potentially more compact reactor topology. However, the physics governing their formation, equilibrium, and stability are remarkably distinct, reflecting different approaches to [magnetic confinement](@entry_id:161852). We will explore these distinctions by examining the underlying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) principles and the specific mechanisms used to realize these plasma states.

### Defining Characteristics and Magnetic Topology

The primary distinction between a [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) and an FRC lies in their internal magnetic field structure. Both are typically studied within the framework of MHD, where the plasma is treated as a conducting fluid governed by the [force balance](@entry_id:267186) equation $\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B} = \nabla p$ and Maxwell's equations.

A **[spheromak](@entry_id:755209)** is a compact torus that possesses both poloidal (spanning the minor cross-section) and toroidal (directed along the major circumference) magnetic field components, $\mathbf{B}_p$ and $\mathbf{B}_t$, respectively. A key feature is that both of these field components are generated primarily by currents flowing within the plasma itself, a process known as [self-organization](@entry_id:186805). This is in stark contrast to the tokamak, where the strong [toroidal field](@entry_id:194478) is generated by external coils. The magnetic field lines in a [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) are helical and lie on a set of nested toroidal flux surfaces [@problem_id:3719209]. The magnitudes of the poloidal and toroidal fields are typically comparable, $|B_p| \sim |B_t|$.

A **Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC)**, in its idealized form, is a compact torus with a purely [poloidal magnetic field](@entry_id:753563), meaning its [toroidal field](@entry_id:194478) component is zero, $\mathbf{B}_t \approx 0$. The name "field-reversed" originates from its defining feature: the axial component of the [poloidal magnetic field](@entry_id:753563) on the geometric axis is oriented oppositely to the axial field outside the plasma separatrix. This structure is fundamentally diamagnetic; a strong toroidal (azimuthal) [plasma current](@entry_id:182365), $J_\theta$, is driven to expel the external confining magnetic field from the plasma interior, leading to the reversal.

The degree of reversal is quantified by the **field-reversal parameter**, $F$, defined as the ratio of the axial magnetic field on the axis, $B_z(r=0)$, to the external confining field, $B_{\text{ext}}$:
$$
F = \frac{B_z(r=0)}{B_{\text{ext}}}
$$
By definition, an FRC exists when $F  0$. In experiments, such as a field-reversed [theta-pinch](@entry_id:193524), this parameter is measured using magnetic probes. A probe on the axis measures the local time-varying field. By Faraday's law, the induced voltage $V(t)$ in a probe of area $S$ is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field, $V(t) = -S \, dB_z/dt$. The axial magnetic field at a specific time $t$ can be reconstructed by integrating the voltage signal from the start of the discharge:
$$
B_z(t) = -\frac{1}{S} \int_0^t V(t') \, dt'
$$
By comparing the reconstructed on-axis field to the externally applied field (measured by a separate probe in vacuum), one can experimentally determine the field-reversal parameter and confirm the formation of an FRC [@problem_id:3719196].

### The Principle of Magnetic Relaxation: Helicity and Taylor States

The self-generation of magnetic fields in a [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) is a profound example of plasma self-organization. The theoretical framework for this phenomenon is provided by the principle of Taylor relaxation. The foundation of this principle lies in the concept of **[magnetic helicity](@entry_id:751625)**.

Magnetic helicity, defined for a volume $V$ as
$$
K = \int_V \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} \, dV
$$
where $\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$ is the magnetic field and $\mathbf{A}$ is the [vector potential](@entry_id:153642), is a measure of the topological structure of the magnetic field, quantifying the degree of linkage and knottedness of magnetic flux tubes. In ideal MHD (zero [resistivity](@entry_id:266481)), [magnetic helicity](@entry_id:751625) is perfectly conserved. J.B. Taylor's crucial insight was that in a real plasma with high but finite conductivity (i.e., a high **Lundquist number** $S = \tau_R/\tau_A \gg 1$, where $\tau_R$ is the resistive diffusion time and $\tau_A$ is the Alfvén transit time), [magnetic energy](@entry_id:265074) $E = \int_V (B^2/2\mu_0) \, dV$ can be rapidly dissipated through [magnetic reconnection](@entry_id:188309) events, while the total [magnetic helicity](@entry_id:751625) remains approximately conserved. Reconnection breaks and re-joins field lines, changing the local topology but largely preserving the global linkage that $K$ represents.

Taylor's hypothesis posits that a turbulent, slightly resistive plasma will relax towards a state of minimum [magnetic energy](@entry_id:265074) subject to the constraint of conserved [magnetic helicity](@entry_id:751625). The calculus of variations shows that this minimum energy state is described by the force-free equation:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \lambda \mathbf{B}
$$
where $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier that must be spatially constant. This is known as a **Taylor state** or a linear force-free field. In such a state, the plasma current density is everywhere parallel to the magnetic field, $\mathbf{J} = (\lambda/\mu_0)\mathbf{B}$, implying the Lorentz force $\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}$ is zero. Spheromak equilibria are exceptionally well-described as Taylor states [@problem_id:3719209].

The preferential conservation of [helicity](@entry_id:157633) over energy can be appreciated by examining their resistive decay rates. For a plasma in a relaxed Taylor state, it can be shown that the fractional decay rates of energy and helicity are identical [@problem_id:3719233]:
$$
\frac{1}{E} \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{1}{K} \frac{dK}{dt} = -\frac{2\eta\lambda^2}{\mu_0}
$$
This result applies to the slow decay *of* a relaxed state. The relaxation process *towards* this state, however, involves rapid energy dissipation while helicity is conserved. This makes [helicity](@entry_id:157633) a "rugged" invariant that governs the final relaxed state of the plasma.

It is important to note that [magnetic helicity](@entry_id:751625) is only a gauge-invariant quantity if the integration volume $V$ is bounded by a magnetic surface, where the normal component of the magnetic field is zero, $\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{n} = 0$. If flux penetrates the boundary, a gauge-invariant **relative [magnetic helicity](@entry_id:751625)** must be defined with respect to a reference field [@problem_id:3719191]. This distinction is crucial for systems with external field coils or electrodes.

Because of their linked poloidal and [toroidal field](@entry_id:194478) structure, spheromaks are inherently high-[helicity](@entry_id:157633) configurations. FRCs, with their lack of [toroidal field](@entry_id:194478) and flux, are conversely very low-[helicity](@entry_id:157633) states. This fundamental topological difference dictates their distinct formation and stability physics [@problem_id:3719191].

### Equilibrium Structures

The nature of the equilibrium state differs significantly between spheromaks and FRCs, stemming from their differing internal current and field profiles.

#### Spheromak Equilibrium: The Taylor State

The equilibrium of a [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) is a direct realization of a Taylor state. The value of the parameter $\lambda$ is not arbitrary; it is an eigenvalue determined by the geometry and boundary conditions of the confinement volume (the "flux conserver"). Solutions to the equation $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \lambda \mathbf{B}$ only exist for a [discrete set](@entry_id:146023) of $\lambda$ values.

To illustrate, consider an axisymmetric plasma in a cylindrical conductor of radius $a$. Assuming solutions of the form $\mathbf{B}(r,z) = \tilde{\mathbf{B}}(r) \exp(ikz)$, the force-free equation reduces to a Bessel equation for the axial field component $\tilde{B}_z(r)$. For solutions regular at the axis ($r=0$), the field components are given by Bessel functions of the first kind, $J_0$ and $J_1$:
$$
\tilde{B}_z(r) \propto J_0(\kappa r), \quad \tilde{B}_\phi(r) \propto J_1(\kappa r), \quad \tilde{B}_r(r) \propto J_1(\kappa r)
$$
where $\kappa^2 = \lambda^2 - k^2$. The boundary condition at the perfectly conducting wall, $B_r(a) = 0$, requires that $J_1(\kappa a) = 0$. This quantizes the allowed values of $\kappa$. If we denote the $n$-th positive zero of $J_1$ as $j_{1,n}$, then $\kappa a = j_{1,n}$. This leads to a [discrete spectrum](@entry_id:150970) for the eigenvalue $\lambda$:
$$
\lambda a = \pm\sqrt{j_{1,n}^2 + (ka)^2}
$$
This result demonstrates that the geometry ($a, k$) dictates the possible relaxed states the [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) can occupy [@problem_id:3719195].

#### FRC Equilibrium: The High-Beta State

In contrast to the force-free, low-pressure [spheromak](@entry_id:755209), the FRC is a fundamentally **high-beta** configuration, where beta ($\beta$) is the ratio of plasma pressure to [magnetic pressure](@entry_id:272413). The equilibrium is sustained by a large plasma pressure gradient that balances the magnetic pressure of the confining field, $\nabla p = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}$. The plasma is highly diamagnetic, with $\beta \approx 1$ on the magnetic axis. The governing [equilibrium equation](@entry_id:749057) is the Grad-Shafranov equation, which includes the pressure term. This high-beta nature is a key attraction of the FRC concept for fusion, as it promises more efficient use of the magnetic field.

### Formation and Sustainment Mechanisms

The different physics of spheromaks and FRCs leads to entirely different methods for their creation and sustainment.

#### Spheromak: Helicity Injection and Flux Amplification

Spheromaks are typically formed and sustained using **coaxial helicity injection**. A [magnetized plasma](@entry_id:201225) gun, consisting of coaxial electrodes, is used. A bias poloidal magnetic flux, $\Psi_{\text{inj}}$, is established linking the electrodes. A large voltage, $V$, is then applied across the electrodes, which drives a current that ionizes gas and ejects [magnetized plasma](@entry_id:201225) into a larger confinement volume (the flux conserver).

The crucial physics is that this process injects [magnetic helicity](@entry_id:751625) at a rate given by:
$$
\frac{dK}{dt}_{\text{inj}} = 2V\Psi_{\text{inj}}
$$
This injected [helicity](@entry_id:157633) drives the plasma to relax towards a Taylor state within the flux conserver. During this relaxation, the plasma undergoes a process of **[flux amplification](@entry_id:749479)**. The injected [poloidal flux](@entry_id:753562) and the toroidal flux generated by the gun current become interlinked, and the relaxation process converts this linked flux (helicity) into the equilibrium poloidal and toroidal fluxes of the [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) state. The final [poloidal flux](@entry_id:753562) in the [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) can be many times larger than the initial bias flux $\Psi_{\text{inj}}$ applied at the gun [@problem_id:3719242].

In a steady-state [spheromak](@entry_id:755209), the helicity injection rate must balance the rate of resistive helicity dissipation, $\dot{K}_{\text{diss}} = 2\eta \int_V \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{B} \, dV$. Equating the two rates allows one to relate the operational parameters of the gun ($V, \Psi_{\text{inj}}$) to the equilibrium parameter $\lambda$ of the resulting Taylor state [@problem_id:3719240]:
$$
\lambda = \frac{\mu_0 V \Psi_{\text{inj}}}{\eta \int_V B^2 \, dV}
$$

#### FRC: Flux Trapping and RMF Sustainment

FRCs are classically formed in a **Field-Reversed Theta-Pinch (FRTP)**. The process involves several steps [@problem_id:3719221]:
1.  A cylindrical vacuum vessel is filled with gas and a weak, uniform axial "bias" magnetic field, $B_b$, is applied.
2.  The gas is pre-ionized to form a low-density plasma column.
3.  A large current is rapidly pulsed through a single-turn "[theta-pinch](@entry_id:193524)" coil surrounding the vessel. This drives a strong main magnetic field, $B_{\text{ext}}(t)$, in the direction opposite to the bias field.

The rapid rise of the external field induces a strong azimuthal electric field, $E_\theta$, by Faraday's law. In the highly conductive plasma, this drives a large azimuthal current, $J_\theta$. By Lenz's law, this current creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in external flux. If the field rise is sufficiently fast compared to the [magnetic diffusion](@entry_id:187718) time into the plasma, the initial bias flux is effectively "frozen in" and prevented from escaping. This phenomenon is known as **[flux trapping](@entry_id:196395)**. The condition for effective [flux trapping](@entry_id:196395) is that the magnetic skin depth, $\delta = \sqrt{2\eta/\mu_0\omega}$ (where $\omega$ is the characteristic frequency of the field rise), must be much smaller than the plasma radius $a$. This sets a maximum allowable [rise time](@entry_id:263755), $\tau_r^{\max}$, for the external field pulse [@problem_id:3719221].

The trapped internal flux (still in the original bias direction) and the strong external reversed field naturally create the FRC's field-reversed topology. Magnetic reconnection at the ends of the cylinder then closes the field lines to form the compact toroidal configuration.

Sustaining an FRC against resistive decay is a major challenge. A leading technique is **Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF)** [current drive](@entry_id:186346). Here, external antennas generate a transverse magnetic field that rotates in the azimuthal direction. This rotating field penetrates the resistive plasma and exerts a torque on the electrons, driving the steady azimuthal current $J_\theta$ needed to maintain the FRC's diamagnetism.

A critical aspect of RMF drive is its parity with respect to the axial midplane ($z=0$). An FRC's closed flux surfaces are symmetric about this plane. For the RMF to drive current directly and efficiently in the core, the flux-surface-averaged azimuthal electric field, $\langle E_\theta \rangle_\psi$, must be non-zero. A symmetry analysis shows that this is only possible if the RMF has **[even parity](@entry_id:172953)** (i.e., is symmetric about the midplane). Odd-parity RMF results in $\langle E_\theta \rangle_\psi = 0$ on the closed flux surfaces, and thus cannot provide direct inductive [current drive](@entry_id:186346) in the core [@problem_id:3719201].

### Stability Characteristics

Spheromaks and FRCs exhibit drastically different stability properties, largely as a consequence of their different magnetic field topologies.

#### Spheromak Stability

The stability of a [spheromak](@entry_id:755209) is dominated by current-driven MHD modes. The most dangerous ideal MHD instability is the $n=1$ **tilt mode**, a global motion where the entire plasma torus attempts to tilt and flip. The presence of a [toroidal field](@entry_id:194478) provides stabilizing line-tension that resists this bending. The stability of the tilt mode is thus highly sensitive to the geometry of the conducting boundary. Prolate (elongated) spheromaks are unstable to the tilt, but oblate ("squashed") spheromaks can be stabilized if the conducting flux conserver is sufficiently close-fitting [@problem_id:3719243].

Because spheromaks possess a radial profile of [magnetic shear](@entry_id:188804) (i.e., a varying [safety factor](@entry_id:156168), $q(r)$), their resistive stability is characterized by **[tearing modes](@entry_id:194294)**. These modes grow on resonant rational surfaces where $q = m/n$ for integer mode numbers $m$ and $n$, allowing [magnetic reconnection](@entry_id:188309) to occur and form [magnetic islands](@entry_id:197895), which can degrade confinement [@problem_id:3719243].

#### FRC Stability

Within the framework of ideal MHD, the FRC is predicted to be grossly unstable. The lack of a [toroidal field](@entry_id:194478) means there is no magnetic tension to resist the **tilt mode**, which is therefore violently unstable in this model. Furthermore, the combination of pressure gradients and regions of unfavorable magnetic curvature (bad curvature), without the stabilizing influence of [magnetic shear](@entry_id:188804), makes the FRC highly susceptible to ideal pressure-driven **interchange and [ballooning modes](@entry_id:195101)** [@problem_id:3719243].

The remarkable fact is that experimental FRCs are observed to be grossly stable for many Alfvén times. This stability is now understood to arise from **kinetic effects** not captured by single-fluid MHD. The large orbits of the ions relative to the plasma size lead to **Finite Larmor Radius (FLR)** effects, which provide a powerful stabilizing mechanism against these fast-growing MHD modes.

In terms of resistive stability, the FRC picture is again different. Because the magnetic field in the core is purely poloidal, the [safety factor](@entry_id:156168) $q$ is effectively infinite, and there are no classical resonant surfaces for [tearing modes](@entry_id:194294) to grow. Thus, the closed-flux core of an FRC is largely free from the spectrum of discrete [tearing modes](@entry_id:194294) that affect spheromaks and [tokamaks](@entry_id:182005) [@problem_id:3719243]. Stability concerns for FRCs are thus dominated by global ideal-like modes and kinetic phenomena, rather than resistive tearing.
