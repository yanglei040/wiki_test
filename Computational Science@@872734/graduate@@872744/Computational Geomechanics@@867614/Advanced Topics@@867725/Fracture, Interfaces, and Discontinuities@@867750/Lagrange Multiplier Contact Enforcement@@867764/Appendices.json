The enforcement is based on the Lagrange multiplier method within the framework of Coulomb friction. The state of the contact point (stick or slip) must be determined, and the final contact traction must be computed. The process adheres to the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) complementarity conditions for contact.\n\nThe givens are:\nThe unit normal vector to the obstacle's surface is $\\mathbf{n} = (0, 1, 0)$.\nThe coefficient of friction is $\\mu = 0.35$.\nThe normal Lagrange multiplier, representing the normal contact pressure, is $\\lambda_{n} = 120\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.

This is expressed as:\n$$ \\|\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{t}\\| \\le \\mu \\lambda_{n} $$\n\nThe computational procedure for contact mechanics often employs a predictor-corrector scheme. We first assume the point sticks (the predictor step) and calculate a trial tangential traction, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{t}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$. We then check if this trial state is admissible by testing it against the friction cone constraint.\n\nStep 1: Check if the point is in stick or slip.\nThe condition for sticking is $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{t}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\| \\le \\mu \\lambda_{n}$. If this condition is violated, the point is slipping.\n\nLet's compute the magnitude of the trial tangential Lagrange multiplier:\n$$ \\|\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{t}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\| = \\sqrt{50^2 + 0^2 + 70^2} = \\sqrt{2500 + 4900} = \\sqrt{7400}\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\nNumerically, this is approximately $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{t}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\| \\approx 86.023\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n\nNext, we compute the maximum allowable tangential traction (the friction limit):\n$$ \\mu \\lambda_{n} = 0.35 \\times 120\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 42\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\n\nNow, we compare the two values:\n$$ \\sqrt{7400}\\,\\mathrm{kPa} > 42\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\nSince $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{t}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\|  \\mu \\lambda_{n}$, the trial state is inadmissible. The assumption of sticking is incorrect, and the point must be in a state of slip.\n\nStep 2: Enforce the slip condition (the corrector step).\nFor a point in slip, the tangential traction must lie on the boundary of the friction cone. This means its magnitude must be exactly equal to the friction limit, and its direction must be opposite to the direction of relative tangential motion. In this rate-independent plasticity analogy, the direction of the corrected tangential traction $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{t}$ is collinear with the trial traction $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{t}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$.

The problem is valid.\n\n3.  **SOLUTION DERIVATION**:\n    *   I need to find the option that correctly designs a mortar LM patch test. This means the chosen discrete setting must be able to exactly reproduce the analytical solution on any mesh configuration. This is the essence of the patch test. The test must also satisfy the LBB (or inf-sup) condition, which guarantees stability and well-posedness of the mixed formulation.\n\n    *   **Analytical Solution for Patch Test**: The goal is to have a constant compressive normal traction on the interface $\\Gamma_c$ at $y=0$. Let's call the contact pressure $p_N  0$. The normal stress on the interface should be $\\sigma_{yy} = -p_N$. Since the normal for body A is $\\mathbf{n}=(0,1)$, the normal traction on A is $t_n = \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{n} = (0,1) \\cdot (\\sigma_{yx}, \\sigma_{yy})^T = \\sigma_{yy}$. So, we need $\\sigma_{yy} = -p_N  0$. The contact is compressive. For body B, the normal is $-\\mathbf{n}=(0,-1)$. The traction action on B from A is $\\mathbf{t}_B = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_B (-\\mathbf{n}) = -(\\sigma_{yx}^B, \\sigma_{yy}^B)^T$. Traction from A onto B is equal and opposite to traction from B onto A. The traction on B is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_B (-\\mathbf{n})$. At the interface, by action-reaction, $\\mathbf{t}^{(A)} + \\mathbf{t}^{(B)} = 0$, where $\\mathbf{t}^{(A)}$ is the traction exerted by B on A, and $\\mathbf{t}^{(B)}$ is exerted by A on B. Let's be precise. Traction vector on a surface with normal $\\mathbf{n}$ is $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$. On body A, the traction is $\\mathbf{t}^{(A)} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(A)}\\mathbf{n}$. On body B, the outward normal is $-\\mathbf{n}$, so the traction on body B is $\\mathbf{t}^{(B)} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(B)}(-\\mathbf{n})$. At the interface, action-reaction requires $\\mathbf{t}^{(A)} = -\\mathbf{t}^{(B)}$, which means $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(A)}\\mathbf{n} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(B)}\\mathbf{n}$. At equilibrium, the stress field must be continuous across the interface if the materials are bonded. Here, they are in contact.\n    *   The problem specifies frictionless contact. This means the tangential component of the traction must be zero. For body A, $t_t = t_x = \\mathbf{t}^{(A)} \\cdot (1,0)^T = (\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{xy})\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (1,0)^T = \\sigma_{xy} n_y = \\sigma_{xy} = 0$. So we require $\\sigma_{xy}=0$ and $\\sigma_{yy} = \\text{constant}  0$ at $y=0$.\n\n    *   Let's check the proposed displacement field: $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (0, -\\gamma y)$ with $\\gamma0$.\n        *   Displacement gradient: $\\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  -\\gamma \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        *   Strain tensor: $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  -\\gamma \\end{pmatrix}$. So $\\varepsilon_{xx}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{xy}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}=-\\gamma$.\n        *   Trace of strain: $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} = -\\gamma$.\n        *   Stress tensor (plane strain): $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda \\operatornametr(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$.\n            *   $\\sigma_{xx} = \\lambda(-\\gamma) + 2\\mu(0) = -\\lambda\\gamma$.\n            *   $\\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda(-\\gamma) + 2\\mu(-\\gamma) = -(\\lambda+2\\mu)\\gamma$.\n            *   $\\sigma_{xy} = 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{xy} = 0$.\n        *   This displacement field yields a state of uniform stress. On the interface $\\Gamma_c$ (where $y=0$), the stresses are constant.\n        *   Normal stress: $\\sigma_{yy} = -(\\lambda+2\\mu)\\gamma$. Since $\\lambda, \\mu, \\gamma  0$, this is a constant compressive stress.\n        *   Shear stress: $\\sigma_{xy} = 0$. This is consistent with frictionless contact.\n        *   So, the proposed displacement field $\\mathbf{u}=(0, -\\gamma y)$ is a valid analytical solution for a patch test with constant pressure. The bodies are under uniform uniaxial compression. The traction is transmitted perfectly. This is the exact solution the numerical method should reproduce.\n\n    *   **The LBB (inf-sup) condition**: This is a crucial part of the problem. For a mixed finite element formulation (like primal variable $\\mathbf{u}$ and Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda_N$), the discrete spaces for $\\mathbf{u}$ (or more precisely, its trace on the boundary) and for $\\lambda_N$ must be chosen carefully. The condition is:\n        $$ \\inf_{\\lambda_h \\in M_h} \\sup_{\\mathbf{u}_h \\in V_h} \\frac{\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\lambda_h [[\\mathbf{u}_h]]_n \\, da}{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{M_h} \\|\\mathbf{u}_h\\|_{V_h}} \\ge \\beta_0  0 $$\n        where $V_h$ is the primal (displacement) trace space and $M_h$ is the Lagrange multiplier (pressure) space. $[[\\mathbf{u}_h]]_n$ is the normal jump in displacement across the interface.\n        *   A well-known result in mortar methods is that for the LBB condition to be satisfied, the Lagrange multiplier space $M_h$ cannot be \"too rich\" compared to the primal trace space $V_h$.\n        *   Typically, if the trace space consists of continuous piecewise polynomials of degree $k$ (e.g., $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ or $\\mathbb{P}_1$), the Lagrange multiplier space should consist of discontinuous piecewise polynomials of degree $k-1$ (e.g., $\\mathbb{P}_0$).\n        *   Specifically, the pair of continuous bilinear elements ($\\mathbb{Q}_1$) for the displacement trace and piecewise constant elements ($\\mathbb{P}_0$) for the Lagrange multiplier is a classic LBB-stable choice. The $\\mathbb{P}_0$ LMs are defined on the slave mesh.\n        *   Using equal-order interpolations, like $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ for both displacement trace and LM, is known to be unstable and leads to spurious oscillations in the pressure field. This violates the LBB condition unless some stabilization technique is used.\n\n    *   **Integration Requirement**: The mortar integrals are of the form $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\lambda_h [[\\mathbf{u}_h]]_n \\, da$. For a patch test, the method must reproduce the exact solution. The exact solution has a linear displacement trace ($u_y(x,0) = -\\gamma \\cdot 0 = 0$) and a constant LM field (corresponding to the constant pressure). The discrete method must be able to represent this. The LM field is constant, so a $\\mathbb{P}_0$ space is sufficient. The trace of the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}=(0, -\\gamma y)$ is $\\mathbf{u}(x,0) = (0,0)$ on both sides of the interface. This is not quite right. A patch test usually involves imposing this displacement field on the boundary of the entire domain composed of the two bodies.\n    *   Let's reconsider the patch test setup. We prescribe the analytical displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y)=(0, -\\gamma y)$ on the exterior boundary of the domain $\\Omega = \\Omega_A \\cup \\Omega_B$. The finite element method should then recover this exact linear field everywhere inside, and consequently, the constant stress and constant contact pressure.\n    *   For the FE method to recover a linear displacement field exactly, the finite elements must be able to represent linear fields. Standard $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ elements can do this.\n    *   The contact constraint is $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\delta \\lambda_N (\\mathbf{u}_B - \\mathbf{u}_A)\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_A \\, da = \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\delta \\lambda_N g_N \\, da \\ge 0$, etc. The weak form involves integrals.\n    *   The mortar integral is $\\int_{\\Gamma_s} \\lambda_h^s (u_n^s - u_n^m) \\, da$. Here, $\\Gamma_s$ is the slave surface. $u_n^m$ is a projection of the master displacement trace onto the slave side.\n    *   For the patch test to pass, the discrete system must be satisfied by the exact solution. If $\\mathbf{u}_h$ is the nodal interpolation of the exact linear field, and $\\lambda_h$ is the projection of the constant pressure, the discrete equations should be satisfied.\n    *   The weak form of the contact term is $c((\\mathbf{u}_A, \\mathbf{u}_B), \\lambda_N) = \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\lambda_N [[\\mathbf{u}]]_n da$. The variation with respect to the multiplier gives the constraint $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\delta\\lambda_N [[\\mathbf{u}]]_n da = 0$. The variation with respect to displacement gives the force term $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\delta[[\\mathbf{u}]]_n \\lambda_N da$.\n    *   For the patch test to pass, the method must be consistent. This means that if the exact solution is polynomial, the discrete formulation should reproduce it. For the linear displacement field, the trace on the interface is also linear (in this case, zero). The contact pressure is constant.\n    *   The discrete LM space must be able to represent a constant. Piecewise constant ($\\mathbb{P}_0$) can. Continuous bilinear ($\\mathbb{Q}_1$) can also represent a constant.\n    *   The key is stability (LBB) and consistency.\n    *   The consistency of the mortar method requires that the mortar projection preserves constants (or linear fields, depending on the test). This is related to the choice of the LM space and the quadrature rule for the mortar integrals.\n    *   A standard result is that for a mortar method to be consistent (pass the patch test), the dual basis functions (related to the LMs) must satisfy $\\int_{\\Gamma_s} \\phi_i^s \\, da = \\int_{\\Gamma_s} (\\Pi (\\phi_i^s)) \\, da$, where $\\Pi$ is the projection from master to slave. A sufficient condition for this is that the LM space $M_h$ contains constants. Both $\\mathbb{P}_0$ and $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ contain constants.\n    *   Crucially, the quadrature rule used to compute the mortar integrals (e.g., $\\int_{\\Gamma_s} \\lambda_h^s u_n^m da$) must be accurate enough. For a $\\mathbb{P}_0$ LM space and $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ primal trace space, the integrand will be a polynomial. The slave mesh partitions the interface $\\Gamma_c$. On each slave element $e_s$, $\\lambda_h^s$ is constant. $u_n^m$ is the projection of a $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ function from the master side. The integral becomes a sum over slave elements $\\sum_s \\int_{e_s} \\lambda_s (u_n^s - u_n^m) da$. If the maste mesh is non-matching, $u_n^m$ on $e_s$ can be a piecewise polynomial. The quadrature must be exact for the product of the LM basis functions and the primal trace basis functions.\n    *   A common choice is to use a quadrature rule that is exact for polynomials of degree $k_{LM} + k_{trace}$. For $\\mathbb{P}_0$ LMs ($k=0$) and $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ primal traces ($k=1$), the product is linear. A 2-point Gauss quadrature rule on each intersection segment would be exact. A rule that \"integrates constants exactly\" is too weak. It needs to integrate the product of basis functions.\n\n    *   Now let's evaluate the options.\n\n    **Option A:**\n    *   **Displacement Field**: $\\mathbf{u}=(0, -\\gamma y)$. We've verified this is a correct choice, leading to constant compressive stress $\\sigma_{yy} = -(\\lambda+2\\mu)\\gamma$ and zero shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}=0$.\n    *   **FE Spaces**: LM field is $\\mathbb{P}_0$ (piecewise constant) on slave. Primal trace is $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ (continuous bilinear). This pair ($\\mathbb{P}_0$/$\\mathbb{Q}_1$) is known to be LBB-stable. It's a classic choice.\n    *   **Integration**: \"use exact quadrature that integrates constants exactly on the mortar segments\". This part is ambiguously stated. To pass the patch test, the quadrature must be exact for the mass matrix and the coupling matrix. The term $\\int \\lambda_h u_h da$ involves a product of a constant ($\\mathbb{P}_0$) and a linear function ($\\mathbb{Q}_1$), which is a linear function. A quadrature rule that integrates linear functions exactly is required. Integrating constants exactly is a necessary but not sufficient condition. A midpoint rule (1_point Gauss) would integrate constants exactly, but not linear functions. A 2-point Gauss rule would. However, the phrase is \"integrates constants exactly\". This could be interpreted as a simplified description. For a patch test with a *constant* stress field, the LM field is constant. The displacement field is linear. The trace of the displacement is also linear. The \"gap\" function is linear. The integral is $\\int (\\text{constant}) \\times (\\text{linear}) dx$. A rule that is exact for linear polynomials is needed. Let's re-read: \"integrates constants exactly on the mortar segments\". This is a weak statement.\n    *   However, compared to other options, this is by far the best option. The core components (analytical solution, FE spaces) are correct. The part about quadrature is a bit imprecise but not fundamentally wrong in its spirit (it asks for exactness, but understates the required order). Passing a patch test IS a test of consistency, and consistency requires sufficiently accurate quadrature. The other options have fatal flaws:\n        *   B: LBB-unstable pairing.\n        *   C: Analytically inconsistent field (violates frictionless assumption).\n        *   D: Incorrect integration scheme (under-integration) that fails the consistency requirement of a patch test.\n    *   Therefore, A is the only option that describes a fundamentally sound approach to a mortar LM patch test. The goal of a patch test is to verify the exact reproduction of a simple, known solution. The $\\mathbb{P}_0/\\mathbb{Q}_1$ pair with exact integration is the standard way to achieve this for a constant pressure state. The description of \"integrates constants exactly\" might be a simplification, but within the choices, it's the most plausible. It's possible the author meant \"at least constants\", or that for this specific case of constant pressure, this rule is sufficient in some specific implementation. For a constant LM ($\\lambda_N = p_0$) and linear displacement $\\mathbf{u}$, the weak form contribution from contact is $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} p_0 \\delta[[\\mathbf{u}]]_n da$. The test displacement $\\delta \\mathbf{u}$ is a basis function. So we integrate $p_0$ times a linear/bilinear function. This is a linear/bilinear function.The quadrature must be exact for this. So \"integrates constants exactly\" is insufficient. But again, it's the best option.\n\n    **Option B:**\n    *   **Displacement Field**: Same as A, which is correct.\n    *   **FE Spaces**: LM field is $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ (continuous bilinear). Primal trace is also $\\mathbb{Q}_1$. This is an \"equal-order\" pairing. This pairing is known to be LBB-unstable. It will produce spurious oscillations in the contact pressure, especially on non-matching meshes. This directly contradicts the requirement \"verify absence of oscillations\".\n    *   **Integration**: \"standard nodal quadrature (one-point per node)\". This is a form of reduced integration, often used as a stabilization technique (also known as \"collocation at nodes\"). While this can sometimes alleviate the instability of equal-order elements, it's not a robust or generally accepted way to satisfy LBB. It often works for matching meshes but can fail for non-matching ones. The problem statement says \"non-matching finite element meshes\". Relying on nodal quadrature for stability is a weak approach and does not guarantee satisfaction of the LBB condition in a mathematically rigorous way. Indeed, it's a known workaround for an unstable formulation. A proper patch test should pass with a formulation that is provably LBB-stable. Hence, this option is incorrect. It proposes an unstable pairing.\n\n    **Option C:**\n    *   **Displacement Field**: $\\mathbf{u} = (\\beta y, -\\gamma y)$ with $\\beta \\neq 0$.\n        *   $\\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\beta \\\\ 0  -\\gamma \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        *   $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbfu)^T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\beta \\\\ \\beta  -2\\gamma \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\beta/2 \\\\ \\beta/2  -\\gamma \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        *   $\\varepsilon_{xx}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}=-\\gamma$, $\\varepsilon_{xy}=\\beta/2$.\n        *   $\\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda(-\\gamma) + 2\\mu(-\\gamma) = -(\\lambda+2\\mu)\\gamma$. This is a constant compressive stress, which is good.\n        *   $\\sigma_{xy} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\mu\\beta$.\n    *   The problem is that this field produces a non-zero shear stress $\\sigma_{xy} = \\mu\\beta \\neq 0$. This means the tangential traction on the interface is non-zero.\n    *   However, the problem statement says \"The test should specify: - An exact displacement field ... consistent with frictionless contact.\" Frictionless contact requires *zero* tangential traction. This displacement field is *inconsistent* with the physics of frictionless contact.\n    *   The option argues that \"the constant shear traction $t_t=\\sigma_{xy}$ is harmless under frictionless contact and does not affect the patch test.\" This is a fallacious argument. A frictionless contact formulation *enforces* zero shear traction. If you prescribe a displacement field that *requires* a non-zero shear traction for equilibrium, the numerical solution will have to fight this. The formulation is not designed to transmit shear. The patch test is meant to verify the formulation's ability to handle the physics it's designed for. Imposing a condition that violates the model's fundamental assumption (frictionless) is not a valid test. The problem is a *contact* problem, not a problem of bonded layers. The frictionless contact algorithm will enforce $t_t=0$, which is in contradiction with the equilibrium state of the analytical solution. The test design is flawed. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n    **Option D:**\n    *   **Displacement Field**: Same as A, which is correct.\n    *   **FE Spaces**: LM on the master side. This is a non-standard choice. The \"mortar\" method name implies a projection. Usually the LM space is defined on one of the meshes (the slave mesh) and the degrees of freedom from the other mesh (the master mesh) are projected. Placing the LM on the master side is possible, but less common. The slave/master designation is mainly about which side's kinematics are constrained. The LM is the \"force\" that enforces the constraint. Usually, the mesh freedom belongs to the slave body, so the LM is defined on the slave side. Let's assume this is a mere notational swap.\n    *   **FE Spaces**: $\\mathbb{P}_0$ for LM, $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ for primal traces. This is a stable pairing.\n    *   **Integration**: \"under-integration on the mortar interface (single Gauss point per coarse segment)\". The LM is on the master mesh, which is \"coarse\". Let's assume \"coarse\" means the mesh with larger elements. The integration is one point per master-side element. This is under-integration. For example, if we integrate $\\int \\lambda_h u_h da$, where $\\lambda_h$ is $\\mathbb{P}_0$ on a master element and $u_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ on slave elements, the integrand is piecewise linear. A single point quadrature (midpoint rule) will not be exact for a linear function unless the function is constant.\n    *   The option states \"Rely on under-integration to suppress oscillations\". This is a red flag. In a well-designed, LBB-stable formulation, you don't \"rely on under-integration to suppress oscillations\". You use quadrature that is accurate enough for consistency, and the stability comes from the choice of spaces. Under-integration is a known trick to \"stabilize\" unstable formulations (like in option B) by making the stiffness matrix singular (rank-deficient), but it's not a rigorous approach and can fail the patch test or lead to other modes of instability.\n    *   The option also says \"expect LBB stability due to the coarse LM location.\" Placing the LMs on the coarser mesh is a general guideline for stability. If the master mesh is coarser than the slave mesh, then a $\\mathbb{P}_0$ LM space on the master might be stable against a $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ trace on the slave. The condition is that the LM space shouldn't be too rich. If the master grid is coarse, the number of LM degrees of freedom is small, which helps stability.\n    *   However, the combination of a stable pair ($\\mathbb{P}_0/\\mathbb{Q}_1$) with under-integration is suspicious. For a patch test to pass, *exactness* is required. Under-integration generally destroys exactness. A patch test with a linear field will typically fail with under-integration, because the discrete equations will not be an exact representation of the continuous ones for that specific solution. The method would not be consistent.\n    *   Thus, while the choice of spaces might be stable, the proposed integration scheme is incorrect for a patch test, which demands consistency. This option is incorrect.\n\n    **Revisiting Option A:**\n    *   This option proposes the correct analytical solution.\n    *   It proposes the classically LBB-stable pair of finite element spaces: $\\mathbb{P}_0$ for the Lagrange Multiplier and $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ for the primal (displacement) trace. This pairing is known not to produce spurious pressure oscillations.\n    *   It correctly states that no stabilization is needed, because the pairing is intrinsically stable.\n    *   The only weak point is the phrase \"exact quadrature that integrates constants exactly\". This is underspecified. A more precise statement would be \"quadrature that exactly integrates the product of the basis functions from the LM and trace spaces\". For $\\mathbb{P}_0 \\times \\mathbb{Q}_1$, this product is a linear polynomial. So, a rule exact for linear polynomials is needed. A 1-point rule integrates constants exactly but not linear functions. A 2-point Gauss rule integrates cubics, so it would be more than enough.\n    *   However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, this is by far the best option. The core components (analytical solution, FE spaces) are correct. The part about quadrature is a bit imprecise but not fundamentally wrong in its spirit (it asks for exactness, but understates the required order). The other options have fatal flaws.\n    *  Therefore, A is the only option that describes a fundamentally sound approach to a mortar LM patch test. The goal of a patch test is to verify the exact reproduction of a simple, known solution. The $\\mathbb{P}_0/\\mathbb{Q}_1$ pair with exact integration is the standard way to achieve this for a constant pressure state. The slight imprecision about the quadrature rule is a minor flaw compared to the disqualifying errors in the other options.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Physical System:** A frictionless contact problem in plane strain between $2$ linearly elastic rectangular bodies, $A$ (below) and $B$ (above).\n- **Interface:** A horizontal potential contact interface $\\Gamma_c$ at $y=0$.\n- **Normals:** Outward unit normal of body $A$ on $\\Gamma_c$ is $\\mathbf{n} = (0,1)$. Outward unit normal of body $B$ on $\\Gamma_c$ is $-\\mathbf{n}$.\n- **Material Properties:** Both bodies have identical isotropic material properties with Lamé parameters $\\lambda0$ and $\\mu0$.\n- **Loading:** No body forces.\n- **Numerical Method:** Abstract mortar contact method with Lagrange multiplier (LM) enforcement for non-matching finite element meshes. A slave side is designated for LM discretization, and a master side provides the kinematic trace.\n- **Governing Physics:**\n    - Small-strain kinematics: $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^\\top\\right)$.\n    - Hooke’s law for plane strain: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda\\,\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\,\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$.\n    - Interface traction: $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}$ on $\\Gamma_c$.\n    - Frictionless contact implies zero tangential traction.\n- **Test Objective:** Design a mortar LM patch test to verify that the discrete formulation:\n    1. Transmits a constant contact pressure without spurious oscillations.\n    2. Exhibits Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) inf-sup stability.\n- **Test Requirements:** The test must specify:\n    1. An exact displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})$ yielding constant compressive normal traction and zero tangential traction on $\\Gamma_c$.\n    2. The LM and primal trace spaces on $\\Gamma_c$.\n    3. The integration requirement over the mortar interface.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It outlines a standard verification procedure (a patch test) for a well-established numerical method (mortar Lagrange multiplier contact) in computational mechanics. The provided physical laws (linear elasticity, small-strain kinematics) are fundamental and correctly stated. The objectives of the test (verifying constant pressure transmission and LBB stability) are standard and crucial for validating such a numerical method. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to design a patch test that verifies the correct behavior of a mortar Lagrange multiplier (LM) formulation for frictionless contact. This requires three components to be correctly specified: an appropriate analytical solution, a stable choice of discrete function spaces, and a consistent integration scheme.\n\n1.  **Analytical Solution:** The test aims to reproduce a state of constant compressive contact pressure, $p_N  0$, and zero shear. The normal traction on body $A$ at the interface $\\Gamma_c$ (with normal $\\mathbf{n}=(0,1)$) is $t_n = \\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}) = \\sigma_{yy}$. The tangential traction is $t_t = \\sigma_{xy}$. Thus, the analytical solution must satisfy $\\sigma_{yy} = -p_N = \\text{constant}  0$ and $\\sigma_{xy} = 0$ on $\\Gamma_c$.\n    Let us examine the proposed displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (u_x, u_y) = (0, -\\gamma y)$ for a constant $\\gamma  0$.\n    The displacement gradient is $\\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial u_x/\\partial x  \\partial u_x/\\partial y \\\\ \\partial u_y/\\partial x  \\partial u_y/\\partial y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  -\\gamma \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The small-strain tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^\\top) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  -\\gamma \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This gives strain components $\\varepsilon_{xx}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}=-\\gamma$, and $\\varepsilon_{xy}=0$.\n    The trace of the strain tensor is $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy} = -\\gamma$.\n    Using Hooke's law for plane strain, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, the stress components are:\n    $\\sigma_{xx} = \\lambda(-\\gamma) + 2\\mu(0) = -\\lambda\\gamma$.\n    $\\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda(-\\gamma) + 2\\mu(-\\gamma) = -(\\lambda+2\\mu)\\gamma$.\n    $\\sigma_{xy} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xy} = 0$.\n    Since $\\lambda, \\mu, \\gamma  0$, the normal stress is $\\sigma_{yy}  0$ and constant. The shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}$ is zero. This displacement field correctly produces a state of uniform uniaxial compression, consistent with frictionless contact and a constant pressure $p_N = (\\lambda+2\\mu)\\gamma$. It is a valid choice for the patch test.\n\n2.  **Discrete Function Spaces and LBB Stability:** The mortar LM method is a mixed finite element formulation. The Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) or inf-sup condition is a necessary condition for the stability of the discrete problem. Violation of the LBB condition typically manifests as spurious, non-physical oscillations in the Lagrange multiplier field (the contact pressure). To satisfy the LBB condition, the space for the Lagrange multipliers $M_h$ must not be inappropriately \"large\" or \"rich\" relative to the space for the primal variable's trace $V_h$. A well-established stable pairing for $2D$ problems using $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ (continuous bilinear) elements for the displacement field (making the trace space $V_h$ a space of continuous piecewise linear functions) is to use a discontinuous piecewise-constant space ($\\mathbb{P}_0$) for the Lagrange multipliers.\n\n3.  **Integration Scheme:** A patch test verifies consistency, which means the numerical method must exactly reproduce the chosen polynomial solution. This requires that the integrals in the weak form are computed with sufficient accuracy. For a mortar formulation, the coupling terms are of the form $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\lambda_h [[\\mathbf{u}_h]]_n da$. In our case, the LM test functions are from $\\mathbb{P}_0$ (constants on each slave element) and the primal displacement trace is from $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ (linear on each element). Their product is a linear function. Therefore, to ensure consistency, the numerical quadrature rule must be able to integrate linear polynomials exactly over the-non matching mortar segments.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Impose a globally linear kinematic field in both bodies with $u_x(x,y)=0$ and $u_y(x,y)=-\\gamma\\,y$ for a constant $\\gamma0$, ... Discretize the LM field on the slave mesh with piecewise constants $\\mathbb{P}_0$ per interface facet, the primal trace on both sides with continuous bilinear $\\mathbb{Q}_1$, and use exact quadrature that integrates constants exactly on the mortar segments. No additional stabilization terms are used.**\n\n*   **Analytical Field**: Correct, as derived above.\n*   **FE Spaces**: The pairing of $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ for the primal trace and $\\mathbb{P}_0$ for the Lagrange multipliers is a classic, LBB-stable choice. This choice is known to preclude pressure oscillations. The statement \"no additional stabilization terms are used\" is correct, as none are needed for this pairing.\n*   **Integration**: The requirement of a quadrature that \"integrates constants exactly\" is an understatement of the actual requirement, which is the exact integration of linear polynomials. However, this is a minor imprecision in the description. The core of this option—the analytical field and the choice of discrete spaces—is fundamentally sound and represents the standard, correct approach to designing such a test. Among the given choices, this is the most accurate description of a valid patch test.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Impose the same globally linear kinematic field as in option A, but discretize the LM field with continuous bilinear $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ on the slave mesh and the primal trace also with $\\mathbb{Q}_1$, using standard nodal quadrature (one-point per node) on the mortar interface. Rely on equal-order pairing and nodal quadrature to transmit the constant traction without stabilization.**\n\n*   **FE Spaces**: This option proposes an equal-order $\\mathbb{Q}_1/\\mathbb{Q}_1$ pairing for the trace and LM spaces. This pairing is known to be LBB-unstable and will lead to spurious oscillations in the contact pressure, which is precisely what the patch test is supposed to detect and fail.\n*   **Integration/Stabilization**: Using nodal quadrature is a form of reduced integration, sometimes employed as a \"stabilization\" trick. However, it is not a robust method for ensuring LBB stability, especially on non-matching meshes, and does not constitute a proper, stable formulation. A test should be passed by a rigorously stable formulation, not one that relies on a numerical remedy for inherent instability.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Impose a combined normal and shear linear kinematic field $u_x(x,y)=\\beta\\,y$ and $u_y(x,y)=-\\gamma\\,y$ with constants $\\beta\\neq 0$ and $\\gamma0$, producing constant normal stress $\\sigma_{yy}=(\\lambda+2\\mu)(-\\gamma)$ but also constant shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}=\\mu\\,\\beta$, and discretize the LM with $\\mathbb{P}_0$ while using exact quadrature. Argue that the constant shear traction $t_t=\\sigma_{xy}$ is harmless under frictionless contact and does not affect the patch test.**\n\n*   **Analytical Field**: This displacement field leads to a non-zero shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}=\\mu\\beta \\neq 0$. This is in direct contradiction with the problem's premise of *frictionless* contact, which requires zero tangential traction. A patch test must be consistent with the physical model it is testing. The argument that the shear traction is \"harmless\" is fallacious; a frictionless contact algorithm is formulated to enforce zero shear traction, and it cannot correctly reproduce an analytical solution that violates this condition.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Impose the globally linear kinematic field $u_x(x,y)=0$ and $u_y(x,y)=-\\gamma\\,y$ as in option A, but place the LM on the master side with piecewise constants $\\mathbb{P}_0$ and use under-integration on the mortar interface (single Gauss point per coarse segment), while retaining $\\mathbb{Q}_1$ primal traces. Rely on under-integration to suppress oscillations and expect LBB stability due to the coarse LM location.**\n\n*   **Integration**: This option proposes using under-integration (a single Gauss point). A patch test is a test of *consistency*, which requires that the numerical scheme can reproduce the exact polynomial solution. Under-integration, in general, destroys this property, meaning the discrete equations will not be satisfied by the exact solution. The method would fail the patch test.\n*   **Stabilization**: The assertion to \"rely on under-integration to suppress oscillations\" is a red flag. While under-integration is sometimes used to stabilize otherwise unstable elements, it is not part of a robust, consistent formulation. A proper patch test should pass due to the inherent stability of the chosen spaces and the consistency of the integration, not due to a numerical trick that compromises consistency.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A provides the only correct and rigorous design for the specified patch test. It combines a valid analytical solution for constant pressure with a classically LBB-stable discretization ($\\mathbb{P}_0/\\mathbb{Q}_1$) that does not require artificial stabilization.

The contact traction resulting from this formulation can be identified from the variation of $\\mathcal{L}_\\epsilon$. The variation with respect to the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ introduces a term corresponding to the contact force. In discrete form, this contact force vector is $\\mathbf{F}_c = \\mathbf{N}^\\top \\mathbf{t}_n$, where the traction $\\mathbf{t}_n$ is effectively $\\mathbf{t}_n = \\boldsymbol{\\lambda} + \\epsilon \\langle \\mathbf{c}(\\mathbf{u}) \\rangle_+$. The system is solved by finding $(\\mathbf{u}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda})$ that satisfies equilibrium and the KKT conditions. In the limit $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$, the penalty term $\\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\big\\langle c(\\mathbf{u}) \\big\\rangle_+^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ imposes a severe energy cost for any penetration $c(\\mathbf{u})  0$. To minimize the functional, the solution must therefore strictly satisfy $c(\\mathbf{u}) \\le 0$.\n\n**A. As $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$, the augmented Lagrangian formulation tends to a pure penalty enforcement on the active set, and the discrete tangent $\\mathbf{K}_T(\\epsilon)$ approaches $\\mathbf{K} + \\epsilon\\,\\mathbf{N}^\\top \\mathbf{N}$, causing the spectral condition number of the linear system to grow at least on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$ (and in mesh-dependent terms, typically $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon/h)$), which degrades the robustness of Krylov solvers without specialized preconditioning or damping.**\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$, the penalty term dominates the functional for any state with penetration, forcing the solution towards $c(\\mathbf{u}) \\le 0$. The Lagrange multiplier term $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\lambda \\, c(\\mathbf{u}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ becomes secondary to the enforcement mechanism. This is the definition of a pure penalty method.\nThe tangent stiffness matrix on the active contact set is given as $\\mathbf{K}_T(\\epsilon) = \\mathbf{K} + \\epsilon\\,\\mathbf{N}^\\top \\mathbf{N}$. The matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ has a bounded spectrum related to the material stiffness and mesh size. The matrix $\\epsilon\\,\\mathbf{N}^\\top \\mathbf{N}$ has its largest eigenvalues growing linearly with $\\epsilon$. The spectral condition number $\\kappa(\\mathbf{K}_T) = \\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{K}_T) / \\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{K}_T)$ will therefore grow. The largest eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{K}_T(\\epsilon)$ will scale as $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$, while the smallest eigenvalues (corresponding to deformation modes not constrained by contact) can remain $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. This leads to $\\kappa(\\mathbf{K}_T)$ growing at least as $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$. The convergence rate of Krylov subspace methods such as CG and GMRES is known to degrade significantly as the condition number of the system matrix increases. Therefore, a large $\\epsilon$ leads to an ill-conditioned linear system and poor solver performance. This statement is a classic and accurate summary of the numerical pathology of the penalty method.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. As $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$, the presence of the Lagrange multiplier block counteracts the large penalty-induced stiffness, so the conditioning of $\\mathbf{K}_T(\\epsilon)$ improves and Newton-Krylov solvers converge more rapidly and robustly.**\n\nThis statement is the opposite of what occurs. The purpose of the augmented Lagrangian method is to achieve accurate constraint enforcement for a *finite*, moderate $\\epsilon$ by iterating on the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$. This avoids the ill-conditioning associated with $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$. If one proceeds to let $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$ anyway, the method degenerates into a pure penalty method, and the ill-conditioning is fully realized. The presence of the multiplier does not magically improve the conditioning of the tangent stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_T(\\epsilon)$. In fact, the conditioning severely deteriorates. Consequently, solver convergence becomes slower and less robust, not more rapid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. As $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$, multiplier updates in the augmented Lagrangian saturate at finite values that effectively cap the contact stiffness contribution at $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, thereby preventing ill-conditioning even on very fine meshes.**\n\nThis statement incorrectly decouples the stiffness from the penalty parameter $\\epsilon$. The contribution to the tangent stiffness matrix comes from the second derivative of the penalty energy $\\frac{\\epsilon}{2} c^2$ with respect to displacements, which is directly proportional to $\\epsilon$. The value of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ does not alter this term in the tangent. While the multiplier $\\lambda$ will converge to a finite physical value (the true contact pressure), the stiffness term $\\epsilon\\,\\mathbf{N}^\\top \\mathbf{N}$ is always present in the tangent matrix for the active set during the Newton iterations. This term is the source of the ill-conditioning, and it is not capped at $\\mathcal{O}(1)$; it grows with $\\epsilon$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In mixed displacement-multiplier discretizations using equal-order interpolation without stabilization, driving $\\epsilon$ to very large values may lead to locking-like behavior and spurious oscillations in the computed contact tractions, so practical formulations use moderate $\\epsilon$ and rely on the multiplier update (and active-set strategies) for robust enforcement.**\n\nThis statement addresses the stability of the finite element discretization for the mixed $(\\mathbf{u}, \\lambda)$ problem. For stability, the discrete spaces for $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\lambda$ must satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi (LBB, or inf-sup) condition. Using equal-order interpolation (e.g., linear basis functions for both displacements and multipliers) typically violates the LBB condition, leading to non-physical, oscillatory pressure fields. A finite penalty parameter $\\epsilon$ has a stabilizing effect on the mixed system, akin to a perturbed Lagrangian or penalty-stabilized method. As $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$, this stabilization vanishes, and the underlying instability of the LBB-violating discretization emerges. Therefore, it is standard practice in robust augmented Lagrangian codes to use a moderate, fixed value of $\\epsilon$ and perform outer-loop iterations to update $\\lambda$, thereby converging to the correct contact state without encountering either severe ill-conditioning or LBB-related instabilities.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. In the limit $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$, the normal traction on all points of $\\Gamma_c$ satisfies $\\mathbf{t}_n = -\\epsilon\\,c(\\mathbf{u})$ regardless of whether the point is in separation or contact, which improves accuracy of predicted tractions even on the inactive set where $c(\\mathbf{u}) \\le 0$.**\n\nThis statement incorrectly represents the contact traction. The penalty term is constructed with the Macaulay bracket, $\\langle c(\\mathbf{u}) \\rangle_+$, to ensure it is active only during penetration ($c(\\mathbf{u})  0$). On the inactive set, where a gap exists ($c(\\mathbf{u}) \\le 0$), we have $\\langle c(\\mathbf{u}) \\rangle_+ = 0$. In this separation region, the KKT conditions dictate that the contact traction $\\lambda$ is zero. Therefore, the total traction $\\mathbf{t}_n$ is zero. The proposed formula $\\mathbf{t}_n = -\\epsilon\\,c(\\mathbf{u})$ would predict a large positive (tensile) traction in the separation zone (since $c(\\mathbf{u})  0$), which is physically incorrect for a unilateral contact problem and contradicts the formulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3537803"}]}
