A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived by analyzing the system's state through its different phases: initial stick, slip onset, instantaneous slip, and the subsequent sliding or re-sticking phase.\n\n**1) Critical Driver Displacement $u_{c}$**\n\nInitially, at $t=0$, the system is at rest with $u(0)=0$ and $u_{d}(0)=0$, resulting in zero initial shear traction, $\\tau(0)=0$. As the driver moves, $u_d(t) = vt$. Since $\\tau(0) = 0  \\mu_s \\sigma_n$, the slider is initially in a state of stick.\n\nDuring the stick phase, there is no slip, which means the slider's velocity is zero: $\\dot{u}(t)=0$. With the initial condition $u(0)=0$, the slider's position remains fixed at $u(t)=0$ throughout the stick phase.\n\nThe shear traction $\\tau(t)$ is determined by the quasi-static equilibrium equation:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = k [u_{d}(t) - u(t)]\n$$\nSubstituting $u_d(t) = v t$ and $u(t)=0$ for the stick phase, we get:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = k (v t) = k u_d(t)\n$$\nThe stick phase persists as long as the traction is below the static friction threshold, i.e., $\\tau(t) \\le \\mu_{s} \\sigma_{n}$. The transition from stick to slip occurs at the exact moment the traction reaches this threshold. Let this critical time be $t_c$ and the corresponding critical driver displacement be $u_c = u_d(t_c)$.\n$$\n\\tau(t_c) = \\mu_{s} \\sigma_{n}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for traction during stick:\n$$\nk u_d(t_c) = \\mu_{s} \\sigma_{n}\n$$\n$$\nk u_{c} = \\mu_{s} \\sigma_{n}\n$$\nSolving for the critical driver displacement $u_c$:\n$$\nu_{c} = \\frac{\\mu_{s} \\sigma_{n}}{k}\n$$\n\n**2) Re-sticking Requirement**\n\nThe re-sticking requirement is specified in two parts: the slip displacement jump $\\Delta u$ and the kinematic condition on the rate $v$.\n\n**Part 2a: Instantaneous Slip Displacement Jump $\\Delta u$**\n\nAt the onset of slip (time $t_c$), the friction law changes abruptly. The shear traction that the interface can sustain drops from the static value $\\tau_{static} = \\mu_s \\sigma_n$ to the dynamic value $\\tau_{dynamic} = \\mu_d \\sigma_n$.\n\nThe problem states that the slip event is \"fast\" (instantaneous due to the massless slider) and that \"the driver advance during the fast slip event is negligible.\" This means we analyze the event at a constant driver displacement, $u_d = u_c$.\n\nJust before slip, at time $t_c^-$, the slider is at $u(t_c^-) = 0$.\nJust after the slip event, at time $t_c^+$, the slider has jumped to a new position $u(t_c^+)$. The slider is now sliding, so the shear traction must be equal to the dynamic friction level:\n$$\n\\tau(t_c^+) = \\mu_{d} \\sigma_{n}\n$$\nThis traction is supplied by the deformed spring. According to the equilibrium equation, with $u_d = u_c$ and $u = u(t_c^+)$:\n$$\n\\tau(t_c^+) = k [u_{c} - u(t_c^+)]\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\tau(t_c^+)$ gives:\n$$\nk [u_{c} - u(t_c^+)] = \\mu_{d} \\sigma_{n}\n$$\nThe slip displacement jump, $\\Delta u$, is the change in the slider's position during this event:\n$$\n\\Delta u = u(t_c^+) - u(t_c^-) = u(t_c^+) - 0 = u(t_c^+)\n$$\nWe can solve for $u(t_c^+)$ from the equilibrium equation:\n$$\nu(t_c^+) = u_{c} - \\frac{\\mu_{d} \\sigma_{n}}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $u_c$:\n$$\n\\Delta u = \\frac{\\mu_{s} \\sigma_{n}}{k} - \\frac{\\mu_{d} \\sigma_{n}}{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta u = \\frac{(\\mu_{s} - \\mu_{d}) \\sigma_{n}}{k}\n$$\nThis displacement jump relaxes the stress in the spring from the static to the dynamic friction level, a necessary precursor for re-sticking, as the stress is now in a range ($ \\tau  \\mu_s \\sigma_n $) where sticking is permissible.\n\n**Part 2b: Kinematic Condition for Re-sticking**\n\nAfter the instantaneous slip, for time $t  t_c$, the system is in a dynamic sliding state. During this phase, as long as slip continues ($\\dot{u}  0$), the shear traction remains constant at the dynamic value:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\mu_{d} \\sigma_{n}\n$$\nThe equilibrium equation, $\\tau(t) = k [u_{d}(t) - u(t)]$, must hold continuously. Therefore:\n$$\nk [u_{d}(t) - u(t)] = \\mu_{d} \\sigma_{n}\n$$\nTo find the kinematic relationship between the slider and the driver, we differentiate this equation with respect to time $t$. Since $\\mu_d$, $\\sigma_n$, and $k$ are constants, the right-hand side has a zero derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( k [u_{d}(t) - u(t)] \\right) = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\mu_{d} \\sigma_{n})\n$$\n$$\nk [\\dot{u}_{d}(t) - \\dot{u}(t)] = 0\n$$\nGiven that the driver velocity is $\\dot{u}_{d}(t) = v$, we find the slider velocity $\\dot{u}(t)$:\n$$\nk [v - \\dot{u}(t)] = 0 \\implies \\dot{u}(t) = v\n$$\nThis result shows that during the dynamic sliding phase, the slider moves at the same velocity as the driver. Re-sticking is defined as the cessation of slip, which means the slip velocity becomes zero: $\\dot{u}(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom our derived condition $\\dot{u}(t) = v$, it is clear that re-sticking can only occur if the imposed driver rate $v$ is zero. If $v  0$, the slider velocity is $\\dot{u}(t) = v  0$, meaning sliding continues indefinitely (stable sliding), and the system never re-sticks to begin a new cycle.\n\nTherefore, the necessary kinematic condition for the interface to re-stick is $v=0$. The question asks for the required value of $v$, which we denote as $v_{rs}$.\n\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{rs}} = 0\n$$\n\nThe final answer compiles the three derived quantities: $u_c$, $\\Delta u$, and $v_{rs}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\mu_{s} \\sigma_{n}}{k}  \\frac{(\\mu_{s} - \\mu_{d}) \\sigma_{n}}{k}  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3562894"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the simple rate-independent model, we now engage with the more physically realistic Rate-and-State Friction (RSF) laws that are central to modern geomechanics.

The analysis will proceed by first establishing the governing system of differential equations, finding the steady-state solution, linearizing the system about this steady state, and finally analyzing the eigenvalues of the resulting Jacobian matrix to derive the stability criterion and the critical stiffness $k_c$.\n\nThe system is described by three coupled equations:\n1.  The equation of motion for the slider, which relates the rate of change of shear stress $\\tau$ to the slider velocity (slip rate) $V$.

The nondimensional shear traction at discrete patch index $i$ is\n  $$T_i(t) = k \\left( V_{\\text{pl}} t - u_i(t) \\right) + k_c \\left(u_{i+1}(t) - 2 u_i(t) + u_{i-1}(t)\\right),$$\n  where $V_{\\text{pl}}$ is the nondimensional tectonic loading rate, $u_i(t)$ is slip at patch $i$, and periodic boundary conditions are used so that $u_0 \\equiv u_N$ and $u_{N+1} \\equiv u_1$.\n\nUnder quasistatic balance, set $T_i(t) = \\mu_i(t)$ (since shear traction is scaled by $\\sigma$), and solve algebraically for the slip rate $v_i(t)$ at each patch as\n$$v_i(t) = V_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{T_i(t) - \\mu_0 - b \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\theta_i(t) V_0}{D_c(x_i)} \\right)}{a}\\right).$$\nThis defines a closed system for $\\frac{d u_i}{dt} = v_i(t)$ and $\\frac{d \\theta_i}{dt}$, with $v_i(t)$ given by the above expression. Note that all quantities are nondimensional after scaling by $D_0$, $V_0$, and $\\sigma$, so $V_0$ and $D_0$ appear only as reference scales in the logarithms and can be set to unity in the nondimensional implementation.\n\nDesign and implement a numerical solver using a fourth-order explicit Runge–Kutta method to integrate the ordinary differential equations for $u_i(t)$ and $\\theta_i(t)$ over time. Use $N$ uniformly spaced patches with periodic boundary conditions. Initialize the state variable to the local steady-state value at the background loading rate, $\\theta_i(0) = D_c(x_i)/V_{\\text{pl}}$, and initialize the slip $u_i(0) = 0$. Use parameter values that are otherwise stable for uniform $D_c$: velocity-strengthening with $a - b  0$, and moderate $k$ and $k_c$ (do not choose values that trivially suppress all dynamics).\n\nDefine a detection criterion for intermittent stick-slip as follows: compute the time series of $\\max_i v_i(t)$ and flag an \"event\" whenever $\\max_i v_i(t)$ exceeds $r_{\\text{thr}} \\cdot V_{\\text{pl}}$, where $r_{\\text{thr}}$ is a specified threshold factor. Two events must be separated by at least $\\Delta t_{\\text{sep}}$ to avoid counting noise as intermittent stick-slip. Classify the run as intermittently stick-slip if at least two such events occur; otherwise, classify it as not intermittently stick-slip.\n\nImplement the following test suite of four cases that vary only $D_c(x)$, while keeping all other parameters fixed and velocity-strengthening:\n\n- Case 1 (Uniform, control): $D_c(x_i) = 1$ for all patches.\n- Case 2 (Mild sinusoidal heterogeneity): $D_c(x_i) = 1 + 0.3 \\sin\\left(2\\pi x_i\\right)$, with $x_i$ uniformly spaced in $[0,1)$.\n- Case 3 (Localized weak patch via larger $D_c$): $D_c(x_i) = 1$ except for patches with $x_i \\in [0.45, 0.55)$ where $D_c(x_i) = 5$.\n- Case 4 (Random log-normal heterogeneity): $D_c(x_i)$ drawn independently from a log-normal distribution with geometric mean $1$ and logarithmic standard deviation $0.5$, with a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility.\n\nUse $N = 51$ patches, $V_{\\text{pl}} = 1$, $a = 0.01$, $b = 0.005$, $\\mu_0 = 0.6$, $k = 0.5$, $k_c = 1.0$, time horizon $t \\in [0, 50]$, time step $\\Delta t = 0.01$, and threshold parameters $r_{\\text{thr}} = 20$ and $\\Delta t_{\\text{sep}} = 2$. All quantities are nondimensional.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3,result4]\"), where each result is a boolean value indicating whether intermittent stick-slip was detected in that case. Because outputs are boolean, no physical units need to be reported.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded computational study in the field of geomechanics, specifically investigating the emergence of complex dynamics from material heterogeneity in a system governed by Rate-and-State Friction (RSF). All parameters, governing equations, initial conditions, and numerical procedures are specified completely and consistently.\n\nThe objective is to numerically determine if spatial heterogeneity in the critical slip distance, $D_c(x)$, is sufficient to induce intermittent stick-slip behavior on a simulated one-dimensional fault. The system is parameterized to be in the velocity-strengthening regime ($a-b > 0$), which for a homogeneous fault would lead to stable, steady sliding, not stick-slip. This investigation addresses a fundamental question in earthquake physics: how instabilities nucleate and grow in systems that are nominally stable.\n\nThe physical model consists of a one-dimensional array of $N$ discrete patches, each representing a segment of a fault. The system's evolution is governed by the quasistatic balance of forces and a constitutive law for friction.\n\nThe force balance for each patch $i$ is given by the equality between the shear traction $T_i(t)$ and the frictional resistance $\\mu_i(t)$. In the absence of inertial forces (the quasistatic approximation), the shear traction on patch $i$ is determined by elastic loading from a driving plate and elastic interactions with its neighbors:\n$$T_i(t) = k \\left( V_{\\text{pl}} t - u_i(t) \\right) + k_c \\left(u_{i+1}(t) - 2 u_i(t) + u_{i-1}(t)\\right)$$\nHere, $u_i(t)$ is the slip of patch $i$ at time $t$. The term $k(V_{\\text{pl}} t - u_i(t))$ represents the force from a loading spring of stiffness $k$, pulled at a constant tectonic plate velocity $V_{\\text{pl}}$. The term $k_c (u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1})$ represents the net force from nearest-neighbor coupling springs of stiffness $k_c$, which forms a discrete approximation of the elastic shear stress Laplacian. The system employs periodic boundary conditions, meaning the array of patches forms a circle.\n\nThe frictional resistance $\\mu_i(t)$ is described by the Rate-and-State Friction (RSF) law. This law empirically captures the dependence of friction on both slip rate $v(t)$ and the evolving state of the frictional surface. The specific form used is:\n$$\\mu_i(t) = \\mu_0 + a \\ln\\left(\\frac{v_i(t)}{V_0}\\right) + b \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_i(t) V_0}{D_c(x_i)}\\right)$$\nIn this equation, $\\mu_0$ is a reference friction coefficient at a reference velocity $V_0$. The parameter $a$ quantifies the instantaneous \"direct effect\" of a change in slip rate $v_i(t)$. The parameter $b$ and the state variable $\\theta_i(t)$ describe the \"evolution effect,\" which represents the memory of the frictional surface. $\\theta_i(t)$ can be interpreted as the average age of the population of microscopic asperity contacts. The heterogeneity is introduced through the spatially variable critical slip distance, $D_c(x_i)$.\n\nThe evolution of the state variable $\\theta_i(t)$ is governed by the \"aging\" law:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta_i(t)}{dt} = 1 - \\frac{v_i(t)\\,\\theta_i(t)}{D_c(x_i)}$$\nThis equation states that the contact age $\\theta_i$ increases with time (the \"$1$\" term, representing healing or strengthening at rest) and decreases with slip (the second term, representing rejuvenation or weakening), with $D_c(x_i)$ being the characteristic slip distance over which this evolution occurs.\n\nUnder the quasistatic assumption $T_i(t) = \\mu_i(t)$, we can algebraically solve the RSF equation for the slip rate $v_i(t)$:\n$$v_i(t) = V_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{T_i(t) - \\mu_0 - b \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\theta_i(t) V_0}{D_c(x_i)} \\right)}{a}\\right)$$\nSince all quantities are nondimensional and the reference velocity $V_0$ is set to $1$, this simplifies to:\n$$v_i(t) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{T_i(t) - \\mu_0 - b \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\theta_i(t)}{D_c(x_i)} \\right)}{a}\\right)$$\nThe problem is thus reduced to solving a system of $2N$ coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the slip $u_i(t)$ and state $\\theta_i(t)$ of each of the $N=51$ patches:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{du_i}{dt} = v_i(t) \\\\\n\\frac{d\\theta_i}{dt} = 1 - \\frac{v_i(t)\\theta_i(t)}{D_c(x_i)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, N\n$$\nwhere $v_i(t)$ is given by the expression above.\n\nThis system of ODEs is solved numerically using the fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta (RK4) method, a well-established numerical integrator. The simulation runs from $t=0$ to $t=50$ with a time step of $\\Delta t=0.01$. The initial conditions are set to $u_i(0)=0$ and $\\theta_i(0)=D_c(x_i)/V_{\\text{pl}}$, placing the system in local steady-state at the tectonic loading velocity, which minimizes non-physical initial transients.\n\nAfter running the simulation for each of the four specified spatial distributions of $D_c(x_i)$, the resulting time series of the maximum slip rate across all patches, $\\max_i v_i(t)$, is analyzed to detect intermittent stick-slip behavior. An \"event\" is flagged if $\\max_i v_i(t)$ exceeds a threshold of $r_{\\text{thr}} \\cdot V_{\\text{pl}} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20$. To avoid counting oscillations within a single event, a subsequent event is only counted if it occurs at least $\\Delta t_{\\text{sep}} = 2$ time units after the previous one. If two or more such distinct events are detected, the system's behavior for that case is classified as \"intermittently stick-slip\".\n\nThe implementation proceeds by defining a function for the derivatives, a function for the RK4 step, and a main simulation loop. This loop is executed for each of the four cases of $D_c(x_i)$ heterogeneity: uniform, sinusoidal, localized, and random log-normal. The results are then classified and formatted as required.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# from scipy import ... # No scipy is needed for this problem.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 1D quasistatic RSF slider problem for four cases of\n    heterogeneity in the critical slip distance Dc.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Fixed Model Parameters ---\n    N = 51  # Number of patches\n    V_pl = 1.0  # Nondimensional tectonic loading rate\n    a = 0.01  # RSF parameter 'a'\n    b = 0.005  # RSF parameter 'b'\n    mu_0 = 0.6  # Reference friction coefficient\n    k = 0.5  # Loading spring stiffness\n    kc = 1.0  # Coupling spring stiffness\n    V_0 = 1.0  # Reference slip rate (set to 1 in nondimensional units)\n\n    # --- Numerical Parameters ---\n    T_final = 50.0  # Total simulation time\n    dt = 0.01  # Time step\n\n    # --- Event Detection Parameters ---\n    r_thr = 20.0  # Velocity threshold factor for event detection\n    dt_sep = 2.0  # Minimum time separation between events\n\n    def get_derivatives(t, state, Dc):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the derivatives du/dt and d_theta/dt for the system.\n        \n        Args:\n            t (float): Current time.\n            state (np.ndarray): 1D array of size 2N containing [u_1..u_N, theta_1..theta_N].\n            Dc (np.ndarray): 1D array of size N with Dc values for each patch.\n        \n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: 1D array of size 2N containing derivatives [du/dt, d_theta/dt].\n        \"\"\"\n        u = state[:N]\n        theta = state[N:]\n\n        # Calculate elastic stress T using periodic boundary conditions\n        u_prev = np.roll(u, 1)\n        u_next = np.roll(u, -1)\n        laplacian_u = u_next -
