The context, Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA), is a well-established numerical method in computational geomechanics.

The question is unambiguous, and a unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal, and unbiased language. All terms are defined clearly (e.g., the sign convention for $g_{n}$).\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any invalidating flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. The values provided ($k_n=10^9\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$, overlap $= 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$) are of a plausible order of magnitude for numerical simulations in this field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the normal contact force magnitude, $F_{n}$, and the incremental potential energy stored in the normal contact spring, $\\Delta \\Pi_{n}$, based on the principles of mechanics.\n\nLet us define the interpenetration distance, $d_n$, as the magnitude of the overlap. Based on the problem's definition of the signed gap $g_n$, where $g_n  0$ signifies interpenetration, the overlap magnitude is given as $(-g_n)$.\nTherefore, the interpenetration distance is:\n$$d_n = -g_n = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**1. Magnitude of the Normal Contact Force ($F_{n}$)**\n\nThe contact is modeled as a linear elastic spring. According to Hooke's Law, the magnitude of the force, $F$, exerted by a linear spring is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position. In this context, the force is the normal contact force magnitude $F_n$, and the displacement is the interpenetration distance $d_n$. The constant of proportionality is the spring stiffness, $k_n$.\n\nThe force-displacement relationship is:\n$$F_{n} = k_{n} d_{n}$$\nThe problem states that the force acts to oppose interpenetration, and we are asked for its magnitude, which is a positive scalar.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$k_{n} = 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$$\n$$d_{n} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe magnitude of the normal force is:\n$$F_{n} = (10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{N} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. The number $1000$ has four significant figures ($1, 0, 0, 0$). Thus, $F_{n} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{N}$.\n\n**2. Incremental Potential Energy ($\\Delta \\Pi_{n}$)**\n\nThe potential energy, $\\Pi_n$, stored in a linear elastic spring is the work done to deform it from its reference (zero-energy) state. The problem specifies that the reference configuration is zero overlap, and the incremental energy $\\Delta \\Pi_n$ over the step is the total energy accumulated. The work done, and thus the stored potential energy, is the integral of the force over the displacement path from $0$ to $d_n$.\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = \\int_{0}^{d_n} F_{n}(x) \\,dx$$\nwhere $F_n(x) = k_n x$ is the force at an intermediate interpenetration $x$.\n\nSubstituting the force law into the integral:\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = \\int_{0}^{d_n} (k_{n} x) \\,dx = k_{n} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} x^{2} \\right]_{0}^{d_n} = \\frac{1}{2} k_{n} d_{n}^{2}$$\n\nThis demonstrates the principle of energy-force conjugacy. The force is the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the displacement:\n$$F_{n} = \\frac{d(\\Delta \\Pi_{n})}{d(d_{n})} = \\frac{d}{d(d_{n})}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} k_{n} d_{n}^{2}\\right) = k_{n} d_{n}$$\nThis confirms the consistency of our force and energy formulations.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the energy equation:\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = \\frac{1}{2} (10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^{2}$$\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10^{9} \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$$\n$$\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{J} = 0.0005\\ \\mathrm{J}$$\n\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.0005$ has only one significant figure (the leading zeros are not significant). To express this value with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros: $0.0005000$.\n\n**Final Result**\nThe requested quantities are the normal force magnitude $F_{n} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{N}$ and the incremental potential energy $\\Delta \\Pi_{n} = 0.0005000\\ \\mathrm{J}$.

This is a standard procedure in computational contact mechanics, often referred to as a return-mapping algorithm or a predictor-corrector scheme, which is analogous to procedures used in the theory of plasticity.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in enforcing the Coulomb admissibility condition. The Coulomb friction law states that the magnitude of the tangential force, $|f_t|$, cannot exceed the product of the friction coefficient, $\\mu$, and the magnitude of the normal force, $\\lambda_n$. The normal force is given as a positive compression, $\\lambda_n \\ge 0$.

We compare the trial tangential force, $f_t^{\\text{trial}}$, with the admissible set. The trial state is given as:\n- Trial tangential force, $f_t^{\\text{trial}} = 8 \\text{ kN}$\n\nWe check if the trial force lies within the admissible set by evaluating the condition $|f_t^{\\text{trial}}| \\le f_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$\n|f_t^{\\text{trial}}| = |8 \\text{ kN}| = 8 \\text{ kN}\n$$\nComparing this to the maximum admissible force:\n$$\n8 \\text{ kN}  6 \\text{ kN}\n$$\nSince $|f_t^{\\text{trial}}|  f_{\\text{max}}$, the trial force is outside the admissible set. This indicates that the assumption of an elastic \"stick\" condition is invalid. The contact must slip.\n\nBecause slipping occurs, a correction must be applied. The updated, physically consistent tangential force, $f_t$, must lie on the boundary of the admissible set. This is the \"return-mapping\" step, where the inadmissible trial state is projected onto the boundary of the admissible region. For the one-dimensional Coulomb model, this projection is a simple mapping to the nearest endpoint of the interval $[-\\mu \\lambda_n, \\mu \\lambda_n]$.\n\nThe direction of the final tangential force must be aligned with the direction of the slip tendency, which is given by the sign of the trial force $f_t^{\\text{trial}}$. The sign of the trial force is positive, since $f_t^{\\text{trial}} = 8 \\text{ kN}$. Therefore, the updated force $f_t$ must be on the positive boundary of the friction cone.\n\nThe updated tangential force is thus:\n$$\nf_t = f_{\\text{max}} \\cdot \\text{sgn}(f_t^{\\text{trial}})\n$$\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(\\cdot)$ is the signum function.\nSince $f_t^{\\text{trial}} = 8  0$, we have $\\text{sgn}(f_t^{\\text{trial}}) = +1$.\nThe final tangential force is:\n$$\nf_t = (6 \\text{ kN}) \\cdot (+1) = 6 \\text{ kN}\n$$\n\nIn summary, the trial force of $8$ kN exceeds the friction capacity of $6$ kN, causing slip. During slip, the tangential force is equal to the friction capacity, and its direction opposes the impending motion (which is indicated by the direction of the trial force). Thus, the consistent tangential force is $6$ kN.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "3518158"}]}
