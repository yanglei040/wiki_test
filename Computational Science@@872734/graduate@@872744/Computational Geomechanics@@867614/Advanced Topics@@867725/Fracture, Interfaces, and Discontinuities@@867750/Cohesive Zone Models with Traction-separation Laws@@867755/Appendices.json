It is convenient to first express $\\Delta$ as a function of $F$ and then invert the relationship.\nFrom the interface constitutive law, we can express $\\delta$ as a function of $F$:\n$$ \\frac{F}{A T_c} = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_c} \\implies \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_c} = 1 - \\frac{F}{A T_c} \\implies \\delta(F) = \\delta_c \\left(1 - \\frac{F}{A T_c}\\right) $$\nThis is valid for $F$ decreasing from a peak of $A T_c$ (at $\\delta=0$) to $0$ (at $\\delta=\\delta_c$).\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for $\\Delta_{\\text{bar}}(F)$ and $\\delta(F)$ into the kinematic compatibility equation:\n$$ \\Delta(F) = \\frac{F L}{A E} + \\delta_c \\left(1 - \\frac{F}{A T_c}\\right) $$\nRearranging the terms to group the coefficients of $F$:\n$$ \\Delta(F) = \\delta_c + F \\left(\\frac{L}{A E} - \\frac{\\delta_c}{A T_c}\\right) $$\nTo obtain $F(\\Delta)$, we solve for $F$:\n$$ \\Delta - \\delta_c = F \\left(\\frac{L}{A E} - \\frac{\\delta_c}{A T_c}\\right) $$\n$$ F(\\Delta) = \\frac{\\Delta - \\delta_c}{\\frac{L}{A E} - \\frac{\\delta_c}{A T_c}} = \\frac{A E T_c (\\Delta - \\delta_c)}{L T_c - E \\delta_c} $$\nThis is the global force-displacement response during the softening regime.\n\nThe range of $\\Delta$ for this softening branch is determined by the range of $\\delta$, i.e., from $\\delta=0$ to $\\delta=\\delta_c$.\n- At the start of softening ($\\delta=0$):\n  The force is at its peak, $F_{\\text{peak}} = A T_c(1-0) = A T_c$.\n  The corresponding total displacement is $\\Delta_{\\text{start}} = \\Delta(F=A T_c) = \\frac{(A T_c) L}{A E} + 0 = \\frac{T_c L}{E}$.\n- At the end of softening ($\\delta=\\delta_c$):\n  The force is zero, $F_{\\text{fail}} = A T_c(1 - \\delta_c/\\delta_c) = 0$.\n  The corresponding total displacement is $\\Delta_{\\text{end}} = \\Delta(F=0) = \\frac{0 \\cdot L}{A E} + \\delta_c = \\delta_c$.\n\nThe softening branch is accessible under monotonic displacement control if the response is stable, which means that as $\\Delta$ increases, $F$ decreases.

In the $F$-$\\Delta$ plane, this corresponds to a positive slope, $K_{\\text{total}} > 0$.\n\nThe sign of $K_{\\text{total}}$ is determined by the sign of its reciprocal, $1/K_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{K_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{L T_c - E \\delta_c}{A E T_c} $$\nSince $A$, $E$, and $T_c$ are positive, the sign of $1/K_{\\text{total}}$ is the same as the sign of $(L T_c - E \\delta_c)$.\n- **Stable Softening:** $K_{\\text{total}}  0 \\implies 1/K_{\\text{total}}  0 \\implies L T_c - E \\delta_c  0 \\implies L  \\frac{E \\delta_c}{T_c}$.\n- **Snapback Instability:** $K_{\\text{total}} > 0 \\implies 1/K_{\\text{total}} > 0 \\implies L T_c - E \\delta_c > 0 \\implies L > \\frac{E \\delta_c}{T_c}$.\n\nThe critical condition separates these two behaviors.

Transformation to Global Coordinates**\n\nThe transformation from local to global coordinates for the nodal displacement vector is $\\boldsymbol{d}^{\\text{glob}} = \\boldsymbol{T} \\boldsymbol{d}^{\\text{loc}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{T}$ is a block-diagonal matrix of rotation matrices $\\boldsymbol{R}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{R}  \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{0} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{R}  \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{0} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{R}  \\boldsymbol{0} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{0}  \\boldsymbol{R} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{R} = [\\boldsymbol{n} \\ \\boldsymbol{m}] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe global stiffness matrix is obtained by the standard transformation $K^{\\text{glob}} = \\boldsymbol{T} K^{\\text{loc}} \\boldsymbol{T}^{\\mathsf{T}}$. This operation can be performed on the $2 \\times 2$ sub-blocks. Each $2 \\times 2$ block $K_{ij}^{\\text{loc}}$ in $K^{\\text{loc}}$ is transformed as $K_{ij}^{\\text{glob}} = \\boldsymbol{R} K_{ij}^{\\text{loc}} \\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\nThe blocks in $K^{\\text{loc}}$ have the form $K_{ij}^{\\text{loc}} = (K_{nn})_{ij} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe transformation on the matrix part is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{R} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos^2\\theta  \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta  \\sin^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\boldsymbol{n}\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}} $$\nThus, the global stiffness matrix is the Kronecker product of the normal stiffness matrix $K_{nn}$ and the rank-one matrix $\\boldsymbol{n}\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}}$: $K^{\\text{glob}} = K_{nn} \\otimes (\\boldsymbol{n}\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}})$.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nGiven $\\cos\\theta = 4/5 = 0.8$ and $\\sin\\theta = 3/5 = 0.6$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{n}\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0.8)^2  (0.8)(0.6) \\\\ (0.8)(0.6)  (0.6)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.64  0.48 \\\\ 0.48  0.36 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe $4 \\times 4$ matrix $K_{nn}$ is:\n$$ K_{nn} = 10^9 \\begin{pmatrix} 6  3  -6  -3 \\\\ 3  6  -3  -6 \\\\ -6  -3  6  3 \\\\ -3  -6  3  6 \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\mathrm{N/m} $$\nThe final $8 \\times 8$ global stiffness matrix $K^{\\text{glob}}$ is constructed by multiplying each entry of $K_{nn}$ by the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\boldsymbol{n}\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\nFor example, the top-left $2 \\times 2$ block is $(K_{nn})_{11} (\\boldsymbol{n}\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}})$:\n$$ K^{\\text{glob}}_{11} = (6.0 \\times 10^9) \\begin{pmatrix} 0.64  0.48 \\\\ 0.48  0.36 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3.84 \\times 10^9  2.88 \\times 10^9 \\\\ 2.88 \\times 10^9  2.16 \\times 10^9 \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\mathrm{N/m} $$\nThe block for nodes $1$ and $2$ is $(K_{nn})_{12} (\\boldsymbol{n}\\boldsymbol{n}^{\\mathsf{T}})$:\n$$ K^{\\text{glob}}_{12} = (3.0 \\times 10^9) \\begin{pmatrix} 0.64  0.48 \\\\ 0.48  0.36 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.92 \\times 10^9  1.44 \\times 10^9 \\\\ 1.44 \\times 10^9  1.08 \\times 10^9 \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\mathrm{N/m} $$\nFilling all blocks and rounding to four significant figures yields the final matrix.
