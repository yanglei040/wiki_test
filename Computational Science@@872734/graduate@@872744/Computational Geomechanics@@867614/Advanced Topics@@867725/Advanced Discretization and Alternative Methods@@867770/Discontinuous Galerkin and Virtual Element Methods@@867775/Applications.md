## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical foundations and numerical mechanics of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Virtual Element (VEM) methods. We have seen how these modern discretization techniques are built upon rigorous mathematical principles, offering a powerful alternative to traditional Finite Element Methods (FEM). This chapter now transitions from principle to practice. Our objective is not to reiterate the core concepts but to explore their utility and versatility in solving complex, real-world problems, particularly within the domain of [computational geomechanics](@entry_id:747617).

Geomechanical systems are characterized by intricate geometries, material heterogeneity, nonlinear constitutive behaviors, multi-physics couplings, and the presence of discontinuities such as fractures and faults. These features pose significant challenges to classical numerical methods, which often rely on high-quality, structured, or simplicial meshes. The primary advantage of DG and VEM lies in their inherent flexibility to operate on general polygonal and polyhedral (polytopal) meshes. This capability is not a mere academic curiosity; it unlocks new possibilities for [meshing](@entry_id:269463) complex geological structures, naturally handling non-matching interfaces and local [mesh refinement](@entry_id:168565) ([hanging nodes](@entry_id:750145)), and robustly modeling physical phenomena without being constrained by element shape. The VEM, in particular, achieves this by defining its discrete [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) through a combination of a computable, polynomial-consistent projection and a complementary [stabilization term](@entry_id:755314). This elegant construction avoids the need for explicit basis functions or mappings to a [reference element](@entry_id:168425), ensuring robustness on arbitrary [polytopes](@entry_id:635589) that satisfy mild shape regularity assumptions like star-shapedness [@problem_id:3461310]. This chapter will demonstrate how these foundational strengths are leveraged across a spectrum of advanced applications.

### Modeling Advanced Material Behavior and Failure

The accurate prediction of ground response, [structural stability](@entry_id:147935), and [material failure](@entry_id:160997) is a central goal of geomechanics. This requires [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726) that can capture complex behaviors like plasticity, damage, and [frictional contact](@entry_id:749595). DG and VEM provide a robust framework for integrating such nonlinear models.

#### Elastoplasticity on General Meshes

A cornerstone of soil and [rock mechanics](@entry_id:754400) is the theory of plasticity, which describes irreversible deformation after a material's stress state reaches a yield criterion. The lowest-order VEM is particularly well-suited for elastoplastic analysis. Its formulation is based on a projection of the strain field onto a constant tensor over each element. This projected strain can be directly used as input for standard stress-update algorithms, such as the [radial return mapping](@entry_id:183181) for von Mises or Drucker-Prager plasticity. A key feature of VEM is its "patch test" consistency: for any patch of elements, a linear displacement field (and thus a constant strain field) is reproduced exactly. This ensures that the method does not introduce spurious stresses in trivial loading cases. The VEM stiffness matrix is composed of a consistency part, derived from the strain projection, and a stabilization part, which penalizes non-physical, [zero-energy modes](@entry_id:172472). A properly constructed stabilization vanishes for all linear polynomial fields, preserving the patch test property. This robust formulation allows VEM to deliver accurate results for elastoplastic problems even on highly distorted [polygonal meshes](@entry_id:753564), where low-order finite elements would suffer from severe locking or inaccuracy [@problem_id:3518424].

#### Gradient-Enhanced and Non-Local Models

Classical local plasticity models can lead to [pathological mesh dependence](@entry_id:183356) when simulating [strain localization](@entry_id:176973) phenomena, such as the formation of [shear bands](@entry_id:183352) in soils or rocks. Gradient-enhanced or non-local plasticity models are a common remedy. These models introduce an internal length scale, $\ell$, that regularizes the solution. A typical formulation involves solving a Helmholtz-type partial differential equation for a non-local state variable, such as the non-local equivalent plastic strain $\bar{\varepsilon}_p$. The VEM framework is readily applicable to such higher-order PDEs. The discrete [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) can be constructed to consistently represent both the mass term and the Laplacian term of the Helmholtz operator, using polynomial projections for the function and its gradient, respectively. The inherent flexibility of VEM allows for the [discretization](@entry_id:145012) of these advanced, non-local [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726) on the same general [polygonal meshes](@entry_id:753564) used for the mechanics problem, providing a unified and powerful simulation environment [@problem_id:3518359].

#### Fracture, Damage, and Frictional Contact

Geological media are pervaded by discontinuities. DG methods are naturally suited to model these features, as they permit jumps in the solution field across element boundaries. This capability can be harnessed to directly incorporate physical models of fracture and contact.

For **cohesive fracture**, the [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174) at an interface, which weakly enforces continuity in a standard DG setting, can be replaced by a [traction-separation law](@entry_id:170931). This law defines the traction across the fracture as a function of the opening displacement (the jump $[u]$). The total energy dissipated at the interface during monotonic opening can be shown to be exactly equal to the [fracture energy](@entry_id:174458) $G_c$, defined as the integral of the [traction-separation law](@entry_id:170931). This provides a thermodynamically consistent framework for simulating crack initiation and propagation in materials like rock and concrete [@problem_id:3518381].

For **[frictional contact](@entry_id:749595)**, which governs the behavior of rock joints and faults, Nitsche's method provides a powerful weak enforcement mechanism compatible with both DG and VEM. Instead of using Lagrange multipliers, Nitsche's method adds penalty-like terms to the weak form that depend on the displacement jump and the interface traction. The penalty parameter, $\gamma$, must be chosen carefully to ensure stability and accuracy. A dimensional and stability analysis shows that $\gamma$ should scale with the material stiffness divided by the local element size, e.g., $\gamma \sim E/h$. This framework can be combined with a Coulomb friction law to simulate complex [stick-slip behavior](@entry_id:755445) at interfaces, a critical mechanism in earthquake dynamics and [rock slope stability](@entry_id:754402) [@problem_id:3518356].

### Coupled Multi-Physics Problems

Many critical processes in [geomechanics](@entry_id:175967) involve the interplay of multiple physical fields. The flexibility of DG and VEM makes them ideal candidates for developing robust solvers for these coupled problems.

#### Poroelasticity and Flow in Fractured Media

Poroelasticity, the coupled interaction between solid skeleton deformation and pore fluid flow, is fundamental to problems in reservoir engineering, [hydrogeology](@entry_id:750462), and [soil consolidation](@entry_id:193900). A major challenge is the presence of discrete fracture networks (DFNs), which act as high-conductivity conduits for fluid flow. DG and VEM are exceptionally well-suited for this class of problems. The bulk porous matrix can be discretized with VEM on a general polygonal mesh that conforms to the complex geological [stratigraphy](@entry_id:189703), while the fractures are treated as lower-dimensional interfaces.

A crucial requirement for any flow simulation is the conservation of mass. Using a DG-like approach for flow, one can design [numerical fluxes](@entry_id:752791) at element faces and, importantly, at fracture intersections, that are locally conservative. By introducing an auxiliary pressure variable at a multi-fracture intersection, one can derive a flux distribution that guarantees the sum of fluxes entering the intersection is zero. The resulting [numerical fluxes](@entry_id:752791) are consistent, proportional to the pressure jump, and naturally handle the discontinuous pressure field that arises in fractured media [@problem_id:3518432].

This framework can be extended to **thermo-poroelasticity**, where heat transport is also considered. The temperature evolution equation often includes a dominant advection term, for which standard Galerkin methods are unstable. DG methods, with their use of upwind [numerical fluxes](@entry_id:752791), are naturally suited to stabilize advection-dominated transport. Furthermore, one can perform a [discrete entropy analysis](@entry_id:748504) on the DG [semi-discretization](@entry_id:163562). This analysis shows that the total [entropy production](@entry_id:141771) rate is the sum of physical dissipation (due to [heat conduction](@entry_id:143509)) and numerical dissipation (due to [upwinding](@entry_id:756372) and stabilization). By ensuring all dissipation terms are non-negative, the scheme can be proven to be entropy-stable, satisfying a discrete version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and preventing the growth of non-physical oscillations [@problem_id:3518421].

#### Large Deformations and Moving Boundaries

Problems such as landslides, large-scale consolidation, or soil-penetrometer interaction involve large deformations and moving boundaries, where the assumptions of small-strain theory are invalid. The Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is a powerful technique for such problems. In ALE, the computational mesh moves independently of the material, allowing it to adapt to large geometric changes. When DG methods are formulated on an ALE framework, it is crucial to satisfy the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL). The GCL is a kinematic constraint ensuring that the change in an element's volume is correctly accounted for by the velocity of its boundaries. A conservative ALE-DG scheme updates the conserved variable (e.g., mass in an element) and then divides by the new, updated element volume. Schemes that fail to enforce the GCL can introduce spurious sources or sinks, leading to a loss of accuracy and conservation, especially for uniform fields on a [moving mesh](@entry_id:752196) [@problem_id:3518401].

#### Elastodynamics and Wave Propagation

Simulating [seismic waves](@entry_id:164985), blasting, or impact events requires solving the equations of [elastodynamics](@entry_id:175818). A key challenge is to model wave propagation in an effectively unbounded domain. Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) are artificial absorbing layers placed at the edge of the computational domain to damp outgoing waves and prevent spurious reflections. A DG [discretization](@entry_id:145012) of the first-order [elastodynamics](@entry_id:175818) system can be coupled with a PML, which is realized as a spatially-varying damping term in the governing equations. A discrete energy analysis of the DG-PML system can prove that the total discrete energy of the system is non-increasing. The energy decay is due to three sources: physical dissipation at the boundary, [numerical dissipation](@entry_id:141318) from the DG fluxes (e.g., Rusanov flux), and, most importantly, the absorption sink within the PML. By tuning the PML damping profile and thickness, one can effectively minimize reflections from the computational boundary, enabling accurate simulation of wave phenomena in geomechanics [@problem_id:3518358].

### Advanced Discretization and Solution Strategies

Beyond direct application, the DG and VEM frameworks inspire novel numerical strategies for enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and modeling capabilities.

#### Handling Material Heterogeneity

Geological formations are rarely homogeneous. They often exhibit complex layering and spatially varying properties. VEM is particularly adept at handling such heterogeneity. For example, in an orthotropic elastic material with a spatially varying [stiffness tensor](@entry_id:176588) $\boldsymbol{C}(\boldsymbol{x})$, the VEM [projection operator](@entry_id:143175) can be defined with respect to a [weighted inner product](@entry_id:163877) induced by $\boldsymbol{C}(\boldsymbol{x})$. This allows the consistency term of the VEM formulation to naturally and accurately capture the effect of the heterogeneous material properties without requiring any special treatment or assumptions about the nature of the variation [@problem_id:3518369].

#### Hybrid, Multiscale, and Coupled Methods

The distinct strengths of DG and VEM can be combined. For a reservoir with faulted zones, a hybrid approach might use VEM to mesh the bulk reservoir, accommodating complex [stratigraphy](@entry_id:189703), while using DG to explicitly model the discontinuities and non-matching grids within the fault zones. The key to such a **mixed DG-VEM coupling** is the design of the interface terms that connect the two subdomains. By using a Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) approach, one can define single-valued numerical fluxes for traction and fluid flow at the DG-VEM interface that are based on the average of the fields and a penalty on the jump. This construction guarantees that the fluxes are equal and opposite, ensuring exact conservation of momentum and mass across the coupling interface [@problem_id:3518422].

Another powerful strategy is **multiscale coupling**. A coarse VEM grid can be used to model a large domain, while a fine DG grid provides high resolution in a localized region of interest, such as a fracture corridor. The link between the scales is achieved through restriction and prolongation operators. A conservative restriction operator maps the fine-scale DG solution to a coarse-scale VEM proxy by preserving key [physical quantities](@entry_id:177395), such as the macro-cell averages of the primary field and its corresponding flux. This ensures that the coarse model accurately reflects the average behavior of the fine scale. The composition of this restriction with a simple [prolongation operator](@entry_id:144790) acts as a consistent projection, forming the basis for multiscale finite volume and related methods [@problem_id:3518390].

#### High-Performance Solvers for Coupled Systems

For large-scale, complex coupled problems, the design of the linear solver is as important as the [discretization](@entry_id:145012) itself. The **Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)** method is a variant of DG that introduces a hybrid variable on the mesh skeleton (the faces). This allows all element-interior degrees of freedom to be eliminated locally via [static condensation](@entry_id:176722), resulting in a much smaller global system involving only the face variables. For a coupled problem like a Stokes fluid in a cavity interacting with a poroelastic Biot medium, this leads to a highly structured global matrix. This structure can be exploited to design efficient **[block preconditioners](@entry_id:163449)**. By approximating Schur complements of the system blocks (e.g., the pressure block in the Biot equations), one can construct block-diagonal or block-triangular [preconditioners](@entry_id:753679) that significantly accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers like GMRES, making a computationally challenging problem tractable [@problem_id:3518411].

#### Practical Performance and Benchmarking

Finally, the choice between methods often comes down to practical performance. A simplified but insightful benchmark, such as a [slope stability analysis](@entry_id:754954), can be used to compare DG and VEM. The limit [load factor](@entry_id:637044), which signals the onset of failure, can be computed for both methods. By introducing hypothetical metrics for mesh distortion and polygonal quality, one can study the sensitivity of each method's [stabilization term](@entry_id:755314) to the quality of the mesh. Such a comparative analysis reveals the practical trade-offs and robustness of each method, guiding the choice of [discretization](@entry_id:145012) for real-world engineering applications [@problem_id:3518420].

### Interdisciplinary Connections: Uncertainty Quantification

The deterministic models discussed thus far assume that all material properties and boundary conditions are known precisely. In reality, geological properties are subject to significant uncertainty. The field of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) provides a framework for analyzing the impact of this uncertainty on simulation outcomes. The DG and VEM frameworks can be extended to this probabilistic setting.

For instance, in a stochastic [poromechanics](@entry_id:175398) problem, material properties like Young's modulus $E(\mathbf{x})$ and permeability $k(\mathbf{x})$ can be modeled as [random fields](@entry_id:177952). This turns the governing PDEs into stochastic PDEs (SPDEs). One powerful method for solving SPDEs is the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), where the solution is expanded in a [basis of polynomials](@entry_id:148579) orthogonal to the probability distribution of the random inputs. A Galerkin projection in the stochastic space transforms the SPDE into a larger, coupled system of deterministic PDEs for the PCE coefficients. The stability of the numerical scheme, such as a DG [discretization](@entry_id:145012), can then be analyzed in a mean-square sense. By examining the eigenvalues of the coupled system matrix, one can determine the conditions under which the expected value of the error norm decays over time, providing a rigorous stability guarantee for the [stochastic simulation](@entry_id:168869) [@problem_id:3518394]. This fusion of DG/VEM with UQ methods represents a frontier in [computational geomechanics](@entry_id:747617), enabling more realistic and reliable predictions in the face of natural uncertainty.
