For a spherical meniscus inside a cylindrical tube of radius $r$, the Young–Laplace equation gives:\n    $$s = p_{\\text{air}} - p_{\\text{water}} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}$$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of the water, and $\\theta$ is the contact angle measured within the water phase.\n\n2.  **Hydrostatic Equilibrium**:\n    Consider a vertical column of water in static equilibrium under gravity. The pressure in the water, $p_{\\text{water}}$, at a height $h$ above a free water surface (where pressure is atmospheric, $p_{\\text{atm}}$) is given by the hydrostatic relation:\n    $$p_{\\text{water}}(h) = p_{\\text{atm}} - \\rho_{w} g h$$\n    where $\\rho_{w}$ is the mass density of water and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The problem specifies that the gas (air) density is negligible, so the air pressure $p_{\\text{air}}$ can be considered uniform and equal to atmospheric pressure throughout the column, i.e., $p_{\\text{air}} = p_{\\text{atm}}$.\n\n3.  **Static Capillary Rise Height**:\n    By substituting the hydrostatic pressures into the capillary pressure equation, we can relate the height $h$ of the water column to the radius $r$ of the tube supporting it:\n    $$s = p_{\\text{atm}} - (p_{\\text{atm}} - \\rho_{w} g h) = \\rho_{w} g h$$\n    Equating the two expressions for the capillary pressure $s$ yields:\n    $$\\rho_{w} g h = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}$$\n    Solving for the height $h$ gives the general expression for capillary rise in a single tube:\n    $$h = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{\\rho_{w} g r}$$\n\n4.  **Application to the Onset of Air Invasion (Drainage)**:\n    The problem asks for the capillary rise height $h_{c}$ at the onset of air invasion, which is a drainage process. During drainage, the non-wetting fluid (air) displaces the wetting fluid (water). The three-phase contact line recedes over the previously wetted pore walls. Therefore, the appropriate contact angle to use from the given hysteretic pair ($\\theta_{a}$, $\\theta_{r}$) is the receding contact angle, $\\theta = \\theta_{r}$.\n\n    Air invasion into the porous medium is controlled by percolation through a continuous path of the largest available pore throats. The problem defines the characteristic radius for this event as the air-entry throat radius, $r_{ae}$. The static capillary rise height $h_{c}$ is the maximum height the interconnected water phase can sustain before air breaks through at this critical radius. Thus, we must evaluate the height expression for $r = r_{ae}$ and $\\theta = \\theta_{r}$:\n    $$h_{c} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta_{r})}{\\rho_{w} g r_{ae}}$$\n\n5.  **Incorporation of the Statistical Pore Radius Definition**:\n    The problem provides an explicit expression for the air-entry throat radius based on a lognormal distribution of pore radii:\n    $$r_{ae} = \\exp(\\mu + \\sigma z_{ae})$$\n    where $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of $\\ln r$, respectively, and $z_{ae}$ is the specified inverse standard normal quantile. Substituting this expression into the equation for $h_{c}$ gives the final analytic form:\n    $$h_{c} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta_{r})}{\\rho_{w} g \\exp(\\mu + \\sigma z_{ae})}$$\n\n6.  **Relationship to Air-Entry Suction and the SWCC**:\n    The derived quantity $h_{c}$ has a direct physical meaning in the context of unsaturated soil mechanics.\n    -   **Air-Entry Suction ($s_{ae}$)**: The capillary rise height $h_{c}$ is the water-head equivalent of the air-entry suction, $s_{ae}$ (also denoted $p_{ae}$). The relationship is given by the hydrostatic equation: $s_{ae} = \\rho_{w} g h_{c}$. The air-entry suction is the minimum capillary pressure required to start desaturating the soil by pulling air into the largest continuous pores.\n    -   **Soil–Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC)**: The SWCC plots the relationship between soil suction ($s$) and water content ($\\theta_w$ or degree of saturation $S_r$). The air-entry suction $s_{ae}$ (or its equivalent head $h_{c}$) represents a critical point on the primary drainage curve of the SWCC. For any suction $s  s_{ae}$, the soil remains fully saturated ($S_r = 100\\%$). At $s = s_{ae}$, air enters the pore space, and the degree of saturation begins to decrease. Therefore, $h_{c}$ determines the threshold for the onset of desaturation in the soil column.\n\nThe final expression for $h_{c}$ is given in terms of the specified variables and represents the maximum height of a continuous water column that can be supported by capillary forces in the soil just before drainage begins.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta_{r})}{\\rho_{w} g \\exp(\\mu + \\sigma z_{ae})}}$$", "id": "3561031"}]}
