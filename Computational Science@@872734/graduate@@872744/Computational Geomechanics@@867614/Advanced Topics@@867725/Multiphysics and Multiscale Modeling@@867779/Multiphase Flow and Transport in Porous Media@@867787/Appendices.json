It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics in porous media, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe analysis begins at the pore scale, where the motion of an incompressible Newtonian fluid is governed by the steady-state Navier-Stokes equation, assuming no body forces. The equation for momentum balance per unit volume is:\n$$\n\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the microscopic fluid velocity field within the pore space, $p$ is the local pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. The term on the left, $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$, represents the inertial advective transport of momentum. The terms on the right are the pressure gradient force, $-\\nabla p$, and the viscous dissipation force, $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$.\n\nTo quantify the relative importance of inertial advection versus viscous dissipation, we perform a scaling analysis. We introduce a characteristic length scale $L$ and a characteristic velocity scale $U$. For flow in a granular pack, it is natural to choose the grain diameter $d_p$ as the characteristic length, so $L \\sim d_p$.

This law is valid in the limit of creeping flow, where the Reynolds number is very small ($\\mathrm{Re}_{\\mathrm{pore}} \\ll 1$). In this regime, the inertial term $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$ in the Navier-Stokes equation is negligible compared to the viscous term $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$. The local momentum balance simplifies to the Stokes equation, the volume-averaging of which yields Darcy's law.\n\nAs the superficial velocity $u$ increases, $\\mathrm{Re}_{\\mathrm{pore}}$ increases. When $\\mathrm{Re}_{\\mathrm{pore}}$ is no longer negligible (e.g., approaches or exceeds unity), the inertial forces become significant. The tortuous flow paths within the porous medium, characterized by expansions and contractions, cause the fluid to accelerate and decelerate. These inertial effects lead to additional energy dissipation not accounted for by viscous drag alone. This results in a pressure drop that increases more than linearly with velocity, signifying a breakdown of the linear relationship described by Darcy's law. This non-linear flow regime is often described by the Forchheimer equation, which adds a quadratic velocity term to Darcy's law.

To generalize the capillary pressure behavior across different porous media, Leverett (1941) introduced a dimensionless capillary pressure function, the J-function, $J(S_w)$. He postulated that $p_c$ is proportional to the interfacial forces (represented by $\\sigma \\cos\\theta$) and inversely proportional to a characteristic length scale of the porous medium. This characteristic length is taken to be $\\sqrt{k/\\phi}$, where $k$ is the absolute permeability and $\\phi$ is the porosity.\n\nThe definition of the Leverett J-function, which represents a fundamental principle in this context, is:\n$$J(S_w) = \\frac{p_c(S_w)}{\\sigma \\cos\\theta} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\phi}}$$\nThis dimensionless function $J(S_w)$ is intended to be a universal function of the wetting-phase saturation $S_w$ for porous media with similar pore structure.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires deriving an expression for $p_c(S_w)$ from this definition. By rearranging the equation, we can isolate $p_c(S_w)$:\n$$p_c(S_w) = J(S_w) \\sigma \\cos\\theta \\sqrt{\\frac{\\phi}{k}}$$\nThis is the desired expression, which relates the dimensional capillary pressure $p_c(S_w)$ to the dimensionless J-function $J(S_w)$ and explicitly includes the wettability effect through the contact angle $\\theta$.\n\nNext, we use this expression to evaluate the capillary pressure at the specified saturations. First, we compute the scaling factor that converts the dimensionless $J$-value to a dimensional pressure, using the provided data:\n$\\sigma = 0.03 \\text{ N/m}$, $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$, $\\phi = 0.25$, and $k = 1 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}^2$.\n\nThe scaling factor, let's call it $C$, is:\n$$C = \\sigma \\cos\\theta \\sqrt{\\frac{\\phi}{k}} = (0.03) \\times \\cos(30^{\\circ}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.25}{1 \\times 10^{-12}}}$$\nWe have $\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n$$C = (0.03) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{0.25 \\times 10^{12}} = (0.03) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times (0.5 \\times 10^6) \\approx 12990.38 \\text{ Pa}$$\nThe entry capillary pressure corresponds to the initial invasion of the nonwetting phase, which occurs at the highest wetting-phase saturation where $p_c > 0$. From the data, this is at $S_w = 0.98$. The J-function value is $J(0.98) = 0.08$.\nThe entry capillary pressure is therefore:\n$$p_c(0.98) = J(0.98) \\times C = 0.08 \\times 12990.38 \\text{ Pa} \\approx 1039.23 \\text{ Pa}$$\nThe capillary pressure at $S_w=0.80$ is found using the corresponding J-function value, $J(0.80) = 0.25$.\n$$p_c(0.80) = J(0.80) \\times C = 0.25 \\times 12990.38 \\text{ Pa} \\approx 3247.60 \\text{ Pa}$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the ratio $r = p_{c}(0.80)/p_{c}(0.98)$.\n$$r = \\frac{p_{c}(0.80)}{p_{c}(0.98)} = \\frac{J(0.80) \\times \\sigma \\cos\\theta \\sqrt{\\frac{\\phi}{k}}}{J(0.98) \\times \\sigma \\cos\\theta \\sqrt{\\frac{\\phi}{k}}}$$\nAs shown, the scaling factor $\\sigma \\cos\\theta \\sqrt{\\phi/k}$ cancels out. The ratio simplifies to be the ratio of the J-function values:\n$$r = \\frac{J(0.80)}{J(0.98)}$$\nSubstituting the tabulated values:\n$$r = \\frac{0.25}{0.08} = \\frac{25}{8} = 3.125$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

This scenario describes the classical Saffman-Taylor instability.\n\nThe phase mobility, $\\lambda_{\\alpha}$, for a phase $\\alpha$ is defined as $\\lambda_{\\alpha} = \\frac{k_{r\\alpha}}{\\mu_{\\alpha}}$, where $k_{r\\alpha}$ is the relative permeability and $\\mu_{\\alpha}$ is the dynamic viscosity of phase $\\alpha$. The problem defines the mobility ratio, $M$, at the displacement front as the ratio of the mobility of the displacing phase (gas, $g$) to that of the displaced phase (oil, $o$):\n$$\nM = \\frac{\\lambda_{g}}{\\lambda_{o}} = \\frac{k_{rg}/\\mu_{g}}{k_{ro}/\\mu_{o}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a \"sharp-front sense\". In such an idealized piston-like displacement, the porous medium is saturated with only the mobile displaced phase (oil) ahead of the front and only the mobile displacing phase (gas) behind the front. In this case, the relative permeability of each phase in its respective region of single-phase flow is at its maximum value. Assuming there are no residual saturations, these endpoint relative permeabilities are unity: $k_{rg} = 1$ and $k_{ro} = 1$. The mobility ratio then simplifies to a ratio of viscosities:\n$$\nM = \\frac{1/\\mu_{g}}{1/\\mu_{o}} = \\frac{\\mu_{o}}{\\mu_{g}}\n$$\nA linear stability analysis of the interface shows that for a planar displacement front to be stable to small perturbations, the mobility of the displacing fluid must be less than or equal to the mobility of the displaced fluid. An unstable displacement, characterized by the growth of \"fingers\" of the displacing fluid into the displaced fluid, occurs when the displacing fluid is more mobile. The condition for stability is therefore:\n$$\nM \\le 1\n$$\nThe critical mobility ratio, $M_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is the threshold value that separates the stable regime ($M \\le 1$) from the unstable regime ($M > 1$). This threshold occurs precisely at:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1\n$$\nThis is a fundamental result for Saffman-Taylor instability at the Darcy scale, independent of the specific fluid properties, as long as the mobility ratio is defined as the ratio of the displacing phase mobility to the displaced phase mobility.\n\n#### Part 2: Gravity Number ($N_{g}$)\nThe problem defines the gravity number, $N_{g}$, as the ratio of the characteristic buoyancy-driven vertical Darcy flux scale to the imposed horizontal Darcy flux scale.\n\nThe imposed horizontal Darcy flux scale is given directly by the mean imposed horizontal Darcy velocity, $U$.\n$$\nu_{\\text{horizontal}} = U\n$$\nThe characteristic buoyancy-driven vertical Darcy flux arises from the density difference, $\\Delta \\rho = \\rho_{o} - \\rho_{g}$, between the two fluids. The vertical Darcy's law for a single phase driven by a buoyancy pressure gradient is $u_{v} \\approx \\frac{k_v}{\\mu} \\Delta \\rho g$. The problem specifies that this scale should be evaluated using the vertical permeability, $k_{v}$, and the viscosity of the displacing gas, $\\mu_{g}$. Therefore, the characteristic vertical flux is:\n$$\nu_{\\text{vertical}} = \\frac{k_{v} (\\rho_{o} - \\rho_{g}) g}{\\mu_{g}}\n$$\nThe gravity number $N_{g}$ is the ratio of these two scales:\n$$\nN_{g} = \\frac{u_{\\text{vertical}}}{u_{\\text{horizontal}}} = \\frac{k_{v} (\\rho_{o} - \\rho_{g}) g}{U \\mu_{g}}\n$$\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values.
