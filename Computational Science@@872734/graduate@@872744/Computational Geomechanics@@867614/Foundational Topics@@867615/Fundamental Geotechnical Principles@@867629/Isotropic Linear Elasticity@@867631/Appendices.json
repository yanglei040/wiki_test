For a static body in the absence of body forces, the equilibrium equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$. Applying this principle to an infinitesimal tetrahedron with one face having an outward normal $\\mathbf{n}$ and the other three faces aligned with the coordinate planes results in Cauchy's stress relation. This relation defines stress as the linear map from the orientation of a surface (given by $\\mathbf{n}$) to the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ acting on that surface. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\n$$\nIn component form, this is $t_i = \\sigma_{ij}n_j$. We use this fundamental equation to find the traction vector.\n\nGiven the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n30  12  -6 \\\\\n12  40  8 \\\\\n-6  8  50\n\\end{bmatrix}\\ \\text{MPa} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{n}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n2/3 \\\\\n-1/3 \\\\\n2/3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ is calculated by matrix-vector multiplication:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n30  12  -6 \\\\\n12  40  8 \\\\\n-6  8  50\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2/3 \\\\\n-1/3 \\\\\n2/3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(30)(\\frac{2}{3}) + (12)(-\\frac{1}{3}) + (-6)(\\frac{2}{3}) \\\\\n(12)(\\frac{2}{3}) + (40)(-\\frac{1}{3}) + (8)(\\frac{2}{3}) \\\\\n(-6)(\\frac{2}{3}) + (8)(-\\frac{1}{3}) + (50)(\\frac{2}{3})\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nCalculating the components:\n$$\nt_1 = 20 - 4 - 4 = 12\n$$\n$$\nt_2 = 8 - \\frac{40}{3} + \\frac{16}{3} = 8 - \\frac{24}{3} = 8 - 8 = 0\n$$\n$$\nt_3 = -4 - \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{100}{3} = -4 + \\frac{92}{3} = -\\frac{12}{3} + \\frac{92}{3} = \\frac{80}{3}\n$$\nSo, the traction vector is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 80/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{MPa}\n$$\nNext, we perform an orthogonal decomposition of $\\mathbf{t}$ into a normal component and a shear component with respect to $\\mathbf{n}$. The traction vector is the sum of its normal component $\\mathbf{t}_n$ (parallel to $\\mathbf{n}$) and its shear component $\\mathbf{t}_s$ (perpendicular to $\\mathbf{n}$):\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{t}_n + \\mathbf{t}_s\n$$\nThe scalar normal traction, denoted $\\sigma_n$, is the projection of $\\mathbf{t}$ onto the direction of $\\mathbf{n}$. Since $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector, this is given by the dot product:\n$$\n\\sigma_n = \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\n$$\nSubstituting the vectors $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_n = (12)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + (0)\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{80}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 8 + 0 + \\frac{160}{9} = \\frac{72}{9} + \\frac{160}{9} = \\frac{232}{9}\n$$\nThe scalar normal traction is $\\sigma_n = \\frac{232}{9}\\ \\text{MPa}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the shear traction, denoted $\\tau$, is the magnitude of the shear component vector $\\mathbf{t}_s$. By orthogonality of the decomposition, the magnitudes are related by the Pythagorean theorem: $||\\mathbf{t}||^2 = ||\\mathbf{t}_n||^2 + ||\\mathbf{t}_s||^2$. Since $\\mathbf{t}_n = \\sigma_n \\mathbf{n}$ and $||\\mathbf{n}||=1$, we have $||\\mathbf{t}_n|| = |\\sigma_n|$. Also, $\\tau = ||\\mathbf{t}_s||$. Thus:\n$$\n||\\mathbf{t}||^2 = \\sigma_n^2 + \\tau^2 \\implies \\tau = \\sqrt{||\\mathbf{t}||^2 - \\sigma_n^2}\n$$\nFirst, we find the squared magnitude of the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$:\n$$\n||\\mathbf{t}||^2 = (12)^2 + (0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{80}{3}\\right)^2 = 144 + \\frac{6400}{9} = \\frac{144 \\times 9}{9} + \\frac{6400}{9} = \\frac{1296 + 6400}{9} = \\frac{7696}{9}\n$$\nNow we can calculate $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau^2 = ||\\mathbf{t}||^2 - \\sigma_n^2 = \\frac{7696}{9} - \\left(\\frac{232}{9}\\right)^2 = \\frac{7696}{9} - \\frac{53824}{81} = \\frac{7696 \\times 9}{81} - \\frac{53824}{81}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau^2 = \\frac{69264 - 53824}{81} = \\frac{15440}{81}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the shear traction is therefore:\n$$\n\\tau = \\sqrt{\\frac{15440}{81}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15440}}{9}\n$$\nTo simplify the radical, we find the prime factorization of $15440$: $15440 = 10 \\times 1544 = (2 \\times 5) \\times (8 \\times 193) = 16 \\times 5 \\times 193$.

Plane Stress Derivation**\n\nThe plane stress condition assumes that stress components acting in the out-of-plane direction ($x_3$) are zero: $\\sigma_{13} = \\sigma_{23} = \\sigma_{33} = 0$.\nUsing the inverted 3D Hooke's law, the strain components are:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{11} - \\nu\\sigma_{22})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{22} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{22} - \\nu\\sigma_{11})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{12} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{12}\n$$\nThe out-of-plane normal strain $\\varepsilon_{33}$ is generally non-zero:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{33} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{33} - \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22})) = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22})\n$$\nTo find the stress-strain relationship $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{2D} = \\mathbf{D}(E_{\\mathrm{ps}},\\nu_{\\mathrm{ps}})\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{2D}$, we invert the in-plane equations. Solving the first two equations for $\\sigma_{11}$ and $\\sigma_{22}$ yields:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{11} + \\nu\\varepsilon_{22})\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{22} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{22} + \\nu\\varepsilon_{11})\n$$\nFrom the shear equation, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{12} = \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\varepsilon_{12}\n$$\nComparing this system with the generic 2D isotropic form, we identify the plane stress effective parameters:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ps}} = E\n$$\n$$\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\nu\n$$\n\n**2. Plane Strain Derivation**\n\nThe plane strain condition assumes that strain components in the out-of-plane direction ($x_3$) are zero: $\\varepsilon_{13} = \\varepsilon_{23} = \\varepsilon_{33} = 0$.\nWe use the original 3D Hooke's law. With $\\varepsilon_{33}=0$, the trace of the strain tensor simplifies to $\\varepsilon_{kk} = \\varepsilon_{11} + \\varepsilon_{22}$.\nThe in-plane stress components are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{11} + \\varepsilon_{22}) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{11} = (\\lambda+2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{11} + \\lambda\\varepsilon_{22}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{22} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{11} + \\varepsilon_{22}) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{22} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_{11} + (\\lambda+2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{22}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{12} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{12}\n$$\nThe out-of-plane normal stress $\\sigma_{33}$ is generally non-zero and is required to maintain the $\\varepsilon_{33}=0$ constraint:\n$$\n\\sigma_{33} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{11} + \\varepsilon_{22}) = \\nu(\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22})\n$$\nTo find the effective parameters $E_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}$, we match the derived coefficients with the generic 2D form $\\sigma_{11} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{pe}}}{1-\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}^2}(\\varepsilon_{11} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}\\varepsilon_{22})$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{pe}}}{1-\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}^2} = \\lambda+2\\mu\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{pe}}\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}}{1-\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}^2} = \\lambda\n$$\nDividing the second equation by the first gives $\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}$:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+2\\mu} = \\frac{\\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}}{\\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}} = \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ into the expression for the first coefficient:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{pe}} = (1-\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}^2)(\\lambda+2\\mu) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\nu^2}{(1-\\nu)^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\left(\\frac{(1-\\nu)^2-\\nu^2}{(1-\\nu)^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1-2\\nu}{(1-\\nu)^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}\\right) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\n$$\nThus, the plane strain effective parameters are:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}\n$$\n\n### Task B: Modeling Error Quantification\n\nWe analyze a thin layer under uniform in-plane traction $T$ in the $x$-direction. The condition $\\sigma_{33}=0$ throughout means this is a state of uniaxial stress in the $x$-direction.\n\n**1. True 3D Solution (Reference)**\nThe stress tensor for the true state is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{true}} = T, \\quad \\text{all other } \\sigma_{ij}^{\\mathrm{true}} = 0\n$$\nThe trace of the stress tensor is $\\sigma_{kk}^{\\mathrm{true}} = T$. Using the inverted 3D Hooke's law, we find the true strains:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{11}^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{1}{E}((1+\\nu)T - \\nu T) = \\frac{T}{E}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{22}^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{1}{E}(0 - \\nu T) = -\\frac{\\nu T}{E}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{33}^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{1}{E}(0 - \\nu T) = -\\frac{\\nu T}{E}\n$$\nThe reference axial strain is $\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{true}} = T/E$.\nThe elastic energy density is $u = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij}$. For this state:\n$$\nu^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{true}}\\varepsilon_{11}^{\\mathrm{true}}) = \\frac{1}{2}T\\left(\\frac{T}{E}\\right) = \\frac{T^2}{2E}\n$$\n\n**2. Plane Stress Approximation**\nThis approximation uses parameters $E_{\\mathrm{ps}}=E$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ps}}=\\nu$ in a 2D setting. The loading is a 2D uniaxial stress state, $\\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{ps}}=T$ and $\\sigma_{22}^{\\mathrm{ps}}=0$.\nThe predicted axial strain is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{1}{E_{\\mathrm{ps}}}(\\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{ps}} - \\nu_{\\mathrm{ps}}\\sigma_{22}^{\\mathrm{ps}}) = \\frac{1}{E}(T - \\nu \\cdot 0) = \\frac{T}{E}\n$$\nThe predicted energy density within the 2D model is $u^{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{ps}}\\varepsilon_{11}^{\\mathrm{ps}} + \\sigma_{22}^{\\mathrm{ps}}\\varepsilon_{22}^{\\mathrm{ps}})$:\n$$\nu^{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{1}{2}T\\left(\\frac{T}{E}\\right) = \\frac{T^2}{2E}\n$$\nThe plane stress approximation is exact for this problem, as the true state is one of plane stress. The relative errors are:\n$$\ne_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{ps}} - \\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{true}}}{\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{T/E - T/E}{T/E} = 0\n$$\n$$\ne_{u}^{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{u^{\\mathrm{ps}} - u^{\\mathrm{true}}}{u^{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{T^2/(2E) - T^2/(2E)}{T^2/(2E)} = 0\n$$\n\n**3. Plane Strain Approximation**\nThis approximation uses $E_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ for a 2D uniaxial stress state, $\\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{pe}}=T$ and $\\sigma_{22}^{\\mathrm{pe}}=0$.\nThe predicted axial strain is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{1}{E_{\\mathrm{pe}}}(\\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{pe}} - \\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}}\\sigma_{22}^{\\mathrm{pe}}) = \\frac{T}{E_{\\mathrm{pe}}} = T\\left(\\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}\\right) = \\frac{T(1-\\nu^2)}{E}\n$$\nThe strain-relative-error is:\n$$\ne_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}} - \\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{true}}}{\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{T(1-\\nu^2)/E - T/E}{T/E} = (1-\\nu^2) - 1 = -\\nu^2\n$$\nThe predicted energy density within the 2D model is $u^{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{11}^{\\mathrm{pe}}\\varepsilon_{11}^{\\mathrm{pe}})$. To compare with the 3D energy, we must consider the full state implied by the plane strain model. The model assumes $\\varepsilon_{33}=0$ and induces a stress $\\sigma_{33} = \\nu(\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22}) = \\nu T$. The total energy density of this predicted 3D state is $u^{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\sigma_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{11}\\varepsilon_{11} + \\sigma_{33}\\varepsilon_{33})$. Since $\\varepsilon_{33}=0$, this simplifies to the 2D energy form:\n$$\nu^{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{1}{2}T\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{1}{2}T\\left(\\frac{T(1-\\nu^2)}{E}\\right) = \\frac{T^2(1-\\nu^2)}{2E}\n$$\nThe energy-relative-error is:\n$$\ne_{u}^{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\frac{u^{\\mathrm{pe}} - u^{\\mathrm{true}}}{u^{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{T^2(1-\\nu^2)/(2E) - T^2/(2E)}{T^2/(2E)} = (1-\\nu^2) - 1 = -\\nu^2\n$$\nRemarkably, for this loading case, the relative errors in both axial strain and energy density for the plane strain approximation are identical and equal to $-\\nu^2$.\n\n**Summary of Formulae for Implementation**\nFor a given set of 3D parameters $(E, \\nu)$ and traction $T$:\n1. $E_{\\mathrm{ps}} = E$\n2. $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\nu$\n3. $E_{\\mathrm{pe}} = E / (1 - \\nu^2)$\n4. $\\nu_{\\mathrm{pe}} = \\nu / (1 - \\nu)$\n5. $e_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{ps}} = 0.0$\n6. $e_{u}^{\\mathrm{ps}} = 0.0$\n7. $e_{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{pe}} = -\\nu^2$\n8. $e_{u}^{\\mathrm{pe}} = -\\nu^2$", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and implements the mapping between 3D isotropic linear elastic parameters\n    to their 2D counterparts under plane stress and plane strain, and quantifies modeling error.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio nu, Traction T)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (happy path)\n        (3.0e10, 0.25, 1.0e7),\n        # Case 2 (no lateral coupling)\n        (1.0e9, 0.0, 5.0e6),\n        # Case 3 (near-incompressible)\n        (5.0e10, 0.49, 2.0e6),\n        # Case 4 (auxetic)\n        (1.0e10, -0.2, 8.0e6),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for E, nu, T in test_cases:\n        # Task A: Derive 2D constitutive mappings\n        # For simplicity, T is not used in these calculations but is retained for context.\n        # The derivations depend only on E and nu.\n\n        # Plane Stress effective parameters\n        E_ps = E\n        nu_ps = nu\n\n        # Plane Strain effective parameters\n        # As per the derivation: E_pe = E / (1 - nu^2)\n        # and nu_pe = nu / (1 - nu).\n        # We must handle the case nu=1, though it is not in the test suite\n        # and is physically unrealistic for stable isotropic materials (nu  0.5).\n        if nu == 1.0:\n            nu_pe = np.inf\n        else:\n            nu_pe = nu / (1.0 - nu)\n        \n        # Check for nu^2 = 1 (nu = +/- 1)\n        if 1.0 - nu**2 == 0:\n            E_pe = np.inf\n        else:\n            E_pe = E / (1.0 - nu**2)\n\n        # Task B: Quantify modeling error\n        \n        # Plane Stress approximation error\n        # As derived, the plane stress model is exact for a state of plane stress.\n        e_eps_ps = 0.0\n        e_u_ps = 0.0\n\n        # Plane Strain approximation error\n        # As derived, both relative errors are equal to -nu^2.\n        e_eps_pe = -nu**2\n        e_u_pe = -nu**2\n\n        # Compile the list of results for the current case\n        case_results = [\n            E_ps,\n            nu_ps,\n            E_pe,\n            nu_pe,\n            e_eps_ps,\n            e_u_ps,\n            e_eps_pe,\n            e_u_pe,\n        ]\n        results.append(case_results)\n\n    # Format the final output as a single-line string representation of a list of lists.\n    # Using repr() for each number ensures high precision and correct formatting.\n    formatted_results = [\n        \"[\" + \",\".join(map(repr, r)) + \"]\" for r in results\n    ]\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3536714"}]}
