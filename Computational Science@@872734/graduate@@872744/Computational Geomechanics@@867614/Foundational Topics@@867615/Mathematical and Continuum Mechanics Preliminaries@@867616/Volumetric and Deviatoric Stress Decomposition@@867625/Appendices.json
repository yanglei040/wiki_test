Symmetry: $P^{\\text{vol}} = (P^{\\text{vol}})^{\\top}$ and $P^{\\text{dev}} = (P^{\\text{dev}})^{\\top}$. This is evident from the matrix forms.\n2.  Idempotency: $(P^{\\text{vol}})^2 = P^{\\text{vol}}$ and $(P^{\\text{dev}})^2 = P^{\\text{dev}}$. Applying a projection twice has the same effect as applying it once.\n3.  Complementarity: $P^{\\text{vol}} + P^{\\text{dev}} = I_6$. This follows directly from the definition of $P^{\\text{dev}}$.\n4.  Orthogonality: $P^{\\text{vol}}P^{\\text{dev}} = 0_6$. The volumetric and deviatoric subspaces are orthogonal. This also implies that the projected vectors are orthogonal.\n\nThese properties will be verified numerically in the implementation. The numerical tests will also confirm that for any stress vector $s$, the trace of the deviatoric stress part, $s^{\\text{dev}}_1 + s^{\\text{dev}}_2 + s^{\\text{dev}}_3$, is zero, and the shear components of the volumetric part, $s^{\\text{vol}}_4, s^{\\text{vol}}_5, s^{\\text{vol}}_6$, are zero, as dictated by their definitions.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives, implements, and verifies volumetric and deviatoric stress projection\n    operators in Voigt notation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def construct_projectors():\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructs the 6x6 volumetric and deviatoric projection matrices.\n        The Voigt order is [s11, s22, s33, s23, s13, s12].\n        \"\"\"\n        # P_vol projects onto the space of hydrostatic states.\n        # It maps s -> [p, p, p, 0, 0, 0] where p = (s1+s2+s3)/3.\n        P_vol = np.zeros((6, 6))\n        P_vol[0:3, 0:3] = 1.0 / 3.0\n        \n        # P_dev projects onto the space of deviatoric states (trace-zero).\n        # P_dev = I - P_vol\n        I6 = np.identity(6)\n        P_dev = I6 - P_vol\n        \n        return P_vol, P_dev\n\n    def verify_properties(P_vol, P_dev, tol=1e-9):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifies key properties of the projection matrices.\n        - Idempotency: P*P = P\n        - Complementarity: P_vol + P_dev = I\n        - Orthogonality: P_vol * P_dev = 0\n        - Symmetry: P = P.T\n        \"\"\"\n        I6 = np.identity(6)\n        Z6 = np.zeros((6, 6))\n        \n        props = [\n            np.allclose(P_vol @ P_vol, P_vol, atol=tol),\n            np.allclose(P_dev @ P_dev, P_dev, atol=tol),\n            np.allclose(P_vol @ P_dev, Z6, atol=tol),\n            np.allclose(P_vol + P_dev, I6, atol=tol),\n            np.allclose(P_vol, P_vol.T, atol=tol),\n            np.allclose(P_dev, P_dev.T, atol=tol),\n        ]\n        return props\n\n    def run_test_case(s_vec, P_vol, P_dev):\n        \"\"\"\n        Runs a single test case for a given stress vector s_vec.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Convert to numpy array for calculations\n        s = np.array(s_vec)\n        \n        # Calculate expected volumetric and deviatoric parts\n        p = np.sum(s[0:3]) / 3.0\n        s_vol_exp = np.array([p, p, p, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\n        s_dev_exp = s - s_vol_exp\n        \n        # Calculate projections using the matrices\n        s_vol = P_vol @ s\n        s_dev = P_dev @ s\n        \n        # Calculate the required metrics\n        # 1.

This practice explores the subtleties of the plane strain condition, investigating its effect on stress decomposition. You will determine the out-of-plane stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ induced by the kinematic constraint $\\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$ and quantify how ignoring this 3D effect can lead to an inaccurate assessment of the deviatoric stress state, a crucial factor in predicting material yielding and failure.", "problem": "A wide plane-strain section of a dense sand deposit is analyzed under a two-dimensional stress state arising from geostatic loading and excavation-induced shear. The material is modeled as linearly elastic and isotropic with Poisson’s ratio $\\nu = 0.25$. The imposed in-plane Cauchy stress components are $\\sigma_{xx} = 120$ MPa, $\\sigma_{yy} = 60$ MPa, and $\\sigma_{xy} = 30$ MPa, and the plane-strain kinematics enforce $\\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$. \n\nStarting from the three-dimensional linear elasticity relations and the plane-strain kinematic constraint, determine the out-of-plane stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ required by compatibility. Using this $\\sigma_{zz}$, compute the three-dimensional mean stress $p$ and the three-dimensional deviatoric measure obtained from the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor. Then, form a two-dimensional in-plane deviatoric measure by subtracting the in-plane mean from the in-plane stress components and computing its second invariant in the two-dimensional sense. Quantify the difference between these deviatoric measures by the ratio $R = q_{3D} / q_{2D}$, where $q_{3D}$ is the three-dimensional invariant-based equivalent shear measure and $q_{2D}$ is its two-dimensional in-plane counterpart.\n\nReport only the ratio $R$ as your final answer.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elasticity and continuum mechanics, is well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and is formulated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a ratio, $R = q_{3D} / q_{2D}$, comparing a standard three-dimensional deviatoric stress measure to a two-dimensional counterpart defined for an in-plane analysis.\n\nFirst, we determine the out-of-plane normal stress, $\\sigma_{zz}$, which arises due to the plane-strain constraint, $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$. For a linear, isotropic, elastic material, the strain-stress relationship (Hooke's Law) for the $z$-direction is given by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\nSetting $\\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$ gives:\n$$\n0 = \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $\\sigma_{xx} = 120$ MPa, $\\sigma_{yy} = 60$ MPa, and $\\nu = 0.25$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = 0.25 (120 + 60) = 0.25 (180) = 45 \\, \\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe complete three-dimensional Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, under the specified plane-strain condition ($\\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$), is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} 120 & 30 & 0 \\\\ 30 & 60 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 45 \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\text{MPa}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the three-dimensional deviatoric measure, $q_{3D}$. This is conventionally defined as the von Mises equivalent stress, related to the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$, by the formula $q_{3D} = \\sqrt{3 J_2}$. The invariant $J_2$ can be calculated directly from the components of the Cauchy stress tensor:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ (\\sigma_{xx} - \\sigma_{yy})^2 + (\\sigma_{yy} - \\sigma_{zz})^2 + (\\sigma_{zz} - \\sigma_{xx})^2 \\right] + \\sigma_{xy}^2 + \\sigma_{yz}^2 + \\sigma_{zx}^2\n$$\nSubstituting the stress components:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ (120 - 60)^2 + (60 - 45)^2 + (45 - 120)^2 \\right] + 30^2 + 0^2 + 0^2\n$$\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ 60^2 + 15^2 + (-75)^2 \\right] + 900\n$$\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ 3600 + 225 + 5625 \\right] + 900\n$$\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{6} (9450) + 900 = 1575 + 900 = 2475 \\, \\text{MPa}^2\n$$\nNow, we compute $q_{3D}$:\n$$\nq_{3D} = \\sqrt{3 J_2} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 2475} = \\sqrt{7425} \\, \\text{MPa}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the two-dimensional in-plane deviatoric measure, $q_{2D}$. The problem specifies a procedure: first, compute the in-plane deviatoric stress by subtracting the in-plane mean stress, and then compute a measure from its second invariant.\nThe in-plane mean stress, $p_{2D}$, is:\n$$\np_{2D} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) = \\frac{1}{2} (120 + 60) = 90 \\, \\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe components of the in-plane deviatoric stress tensor, $\\mathbf{s}_{2D}$, are:\n$$\ns_{xx, 2D} = \\sigma_{xx} - p_{2D} = 120 - 90 = 30 \\, \\text{MPa}\n$$\n$$\ns_{yy, 2D} = \\sigma_{yy} - p_{2D} = 60 - 90 = -30 \\, \\text{MPa}\n$$\n$$\ns_{xy, 2D} = \\sigma_{xy} = 30 \\, \\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe \"second invariant in the two-dimensional sense\" must be clarified. By direct analogy with the definition of $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij} s_{ji}$, the two-dimensional counterpart, $J_{2,2D}$, is:\n$$\nJ_{2,2D} = \\frac{1}{2} (s_{xx, 2D}^2 + s_{yy, 2D}^2 + 2s_{xy, 2D}^2)\n$$\nSubstituting the components of $\\mathbf{s}_{2D}$:\n$$\nJ_{2,2D} = \\frac{1}{2} (30^2 + (-30)^2 + 2 \\times 30^2) = \\frac{1}{2} (900 + 900 + 1800) = \\frac{1}{2} (3600) = 1800 \\, \\text{MPa}^2\n$$\nAlternatively, $J_{2,2D}$ can be expressed as $J_{2,2D} = (\\frac{\\sigma_{xx}-\\sigma_{yy}}{2})^2 + \\sigma_{xy}^2 = (\\frac{60}{2})^2 + 30^2 = 30^2+30^2 = 1800 \\, \\text{MPa}^2$.\n\nTo form the \"deviatoric measure\" $q_{2D}$ from $J_{2,2D}$, we maintain consistency with the three-dimensional definition. Since $q_{3D} = \\sqrt{3J_2}$, the most logical form for its two-dimensional counterpart is $q_{2D} = \\sqrt{3J_{2,2D}}$. This maintains the same functional structure for the measure in both cases.\n$$\nq_{2D} = \\sqrt{3 J_{2,2D}} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 1800} = \\sqrt{5400} \\, \\text{MPa}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{q_{3D}}{q_{2D}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7425}}{\\sqrt{5400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7425}{5400}}\n$$\nWe simplify the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{7425}{5400} = \\frac{74.25}{54} = \\frac{2475 \\times 3}{1800 \\times 3} = \\frac{2475}{1800} = \\frac{9.9}{7.2} = \\frac{99}{72} = \\frac{11 \\times 9}{8 \\times 9} = \\frac{11}{8}\n$$\nSo, the ratio is:\n$$\nR = \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{8}} = \\sqrt{1.375}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nR \\approx 1.17260394...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R = 1.173$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.173}\n$$", "id": "3570665"}]}
