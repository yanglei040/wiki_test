Let the drained bulk modulus of the porous skeleton be $K_d$, the bulk modulus of the solid grains be $K_s$, the bulk modulus of the pore fluid be $K_f$, and the porosity be $n$. Work from fundamental definitions of moduli, mass conservation, and thermodynamic consistency:\n\n- The drained bulk modulus $K_d$ is defined from a drained hydrostatic test in which pore pressure is held constant, as the ratio of an increment in mean total stress to the corresponding increment in volumetric strain.\n- The solid grain bulk modulus $K_s$ is defined from an unjacketed hydrostatic test in which equal increments of confining pressure and pore pressure are applied, so the effective stress is unchanged and the specimen strains as a solid phase.\n- The pore fluid bulk modulus $K_f$ is defined from isothermal fluid compressibility, relating fluid density change to pore pressure change.\n- The porosity $n$ is the ratio of pore volume to bulk volume.\n- The Biot effective stress coefficient $\\alpha$ maps pore pressure into effective mean stress in the linear poroelastic constitutive law for volumetric response.\n- The Biot storage modulus $M$ maps pore pressure to fluid content change at fixed volumetric strain.\n\nStarting from these bases, first derive an expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of $K_d$ and $K_s$ by analyzing the unjacketed hydrostatic test.

It asks for the derivation of standard theoretical results and their application to a numerical example, using well-defined concepts and physically realistic data. The problem is self-contained and objective.\n\n### Solution Derivations and Calculation\n\nWe adopt a sign convention where compressive stresses and compressive strains (volume reduction) are positive.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Biot effective stress coefficient, $\\alpha$**\n\nThe constitutive relation for the bulk material's volumetric strain $d\\varepsilon_v$ is given in terms of the change in mean total stress $d\\sigma$ and pore pressure $dp_f$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma - \\alpha dp_f) \\quad (*)$$\nThe problem describes an unjacketed hydrostatic test where the change in confining pressure equals the change in pore pressure. This means the mean total stress change is equal to the pore pressure change: $d\\sigma = dp_f$.\n\nSubstituting this condition into the constitutive relation $(*)$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (dp_f - \\alpha dp_f) = \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{K_d} dp_f$$\nIn the unjacketed test, the porous frame itself experiences no additional net stress because the pressure change inside and outside the frame is identical. The bulk volume of the specimen changes only because the solid grains that constitute the matrix are compressed. The deformation is equivalent to that of a non-porous solid made of the grain material subjected to the same hydrostatic pressure change $dp_f$.\n\nThe volumetric strain of the solid grain material, $d\\varepsilon_s$, is defined by the grain bulk modulus, $K_s$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_s = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nIn the unjacketed test, the total volumetric strain of the bulk material $d\\varepsilon_v$ must be equal to the volumetric strain of the grain material, $d\\varepsilon_s$. Thus:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nEquating the two expressions for $d\\varepsilon_v$:\n$$\\frac{1 - \\alpha}{K_d} dp_f = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nAssuming $dp_f \\neq 0$, we can cancel this term and solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$1 - \\alpha = \\frac{K_d}{K_s} \\implies \\boxed{\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s}}$$\nThis is the required expression for the Biot effective stress coefficient.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Biot storage modulus, $M$**\n\nThe derivation for the Biot modulus $M$ from first principles of mass conservation is complex. For a thermodynamically consistent theory, the constitutive parameters are not independent. The relationship between them is most robustly established through energy potentials. This process ensures that fundamental physical laws are respected. This derivation leads to the canonical expression for the inverse of the Biot modulus, which we state here:\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\alpha - n}{K_s} + \\frac{n}{K_f}}$$\nThis well-established formula relates the storage capacity of the medium ($1/M$) to the compressibility of the solid grains (the term with $K_s$) and the compressibility of the pore fluid (the term with $K_f$). The term $(\\alpha - n)$ represents the portion of pore volume change attributed to the compression of solid grains.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\nGiven data: $K_d = 4$ GPa, $K_s = 36$ GPa, $K_f = 2$ GPa, and $n = 0.2$.\n\n-   **Calculate $\\alpha$**:\n    $$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} = 1 - \\frac{4}{36} = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$$\n    As a decimal, $\\alpha \\approx 0.88888...$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $\\alpha = 0.8889$.\n\n-   **Calculate $M$**:\n    We use the expression $\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\alpha - n}{K_s} + \\frac{n}{K_f}$.\n    First, find the values of the terms:\n    $$\\alpha - n = \\frac{8}{9} - 0.2 = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{40 - 9}{45} = \\frac{31}{45}$$\n    Now calculate the two terms for the reciprocal of $M$:\n    $$\\frac{\\alpha - n}{K_s} = \\frac{31/45}{36} = \\frac{31}{1620} \\text{ GPa}^{-1}$$\n    $$\\frac{n}{K_f} = \\frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1 \\text{ GPa}^{-1}$$\n    Sum the terms:\n    $$\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{31}{1620} + 0.1 = \\frac{31}{1620} + \\frac{162}{1620} = \\frac{193}{1620} \\text{ GPa}^{-1}$$\n    In decimal form, $1/M \\approx 0.0191358... + 0.1 = 0.1191358...$ GPa$^{-1}$.\n    Now, calculate $M$:\n    $$M = \\frac{1620}{193} \\text{ GPa} \\approx 8.39378... \\text{ GPa}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $M = 8.394$ GPa.\n\n**Part 4: Physical Implications**\n\n-   The value $\\alpha = 0.8889$ is close to $1$, which indicates that the pore fluid pressure is nearly as effective as the total mean stress in deforming the porous medium. This is characteristic of a material where the solid frame is much more compliant than the solid grains themselves ($K_d \\ll K_s$), which is true here ($4$ GPa $\\ll 36$ GPa).\n\n-   The storage modulus $M = 8.394$ GPa quantifies the pressure required to inject a certain volume of fluid into the rock while keeping the rock's bulk volume constant. Its inverse, $1/M$, represents the specific storage capacity. The two components of $1/M$ are the storage due to solid matrix compressibility ($\\frac{\\alpha-n}{K_s} \\approx 0.0191$ GPa$^{-1}$) and storage due to fluid compressibility ($\\frac{n}{K_f} = 0.1$ GPa$^{-1}$). In this case, the fluid compressibility term is about five times larger than the solid compressibility term. This means that when fluid is forced into the rock at constant bulk volume, most of the storage effect comes from the compression of the fluid already in the pores, rather than from the compression of the solid grains to create more pore space.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.8889  8.394\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3503711"}, {"introduction": "With the core parameters defined, we can apply Biot's theory to predict the behavior of porous media under geotechnically relevant conditions.

The numerical values are physically plausible for a geological material. The problem is a valid, non-trivial application of constitutive theory.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Calculation\nThe derivation begins with a thermodynamically consistent set of constitutive relations for linear poroelasticity, using the specified geomechanics sign convention (compression positive). The two key relations are for the increment of total mean stress $\\Delta \\sigma_m$ and the increment of fluid content $\\Delta \\zeta$:\n1.  $\\Delta \\sigma_m = K_d \\Delta \\varepsilon_v + \\alpha \\Delta p$\n2.  $\\Delta \\zeta = \\alpha \\Delta \\varepsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} \\Delta p$\n\nHere, $\\Delta \\varepsilon_v$ is the volumetric strain increment and $\\Delta p$ is the pore pressure increment.\n\nThe problem specifies an **undrained condition**, which means there is no flow of fluid into or out of a representative volume element. This translates to the constraint $\\Delta \\zeta = 0$. Applying this to equation (2):\n$$ 0 = \\alpha \\Delta \\varepsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} \\Delta p $$\nThis gives a direct relationship between the pore pressure and volumetric strain in undrained conditions:\n$$ \\Delta p = -M \\alpha \\Delta \\varepsilon_v $$\nThis is not the expected sign.

It correctly discretizes the fully coupled system, which, due to the simplification above, is equivalent to solving the diffusion equation with the effective storage coefficient $S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = S_c := S + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{H}$. The term $S_c$ is known as the constrained specific storage coefficient.\n\n*   **Staggered (Split) Scheme:** The problem states this scheme uses a \"fixed-strain flow update,\" where the term $\\alpha\\,\\partial_t(\\partial_x u)$ is treated as zero during the pressure update. This means we are solving the flow equation:\n    $$\n    S\\,\\partial_t p - D\\,\\partial_{xx} p = 0\n    $$\n    This corresponds to using an effective storage coefficient $S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = S$.

Algorithm**\n\nThe core of the algorithm involves setting up and solving the tridiagonal system for each time step, for each of the two schemes (which differ only by the value of $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$), and for each of the five test cases. The final pressure profiles are then used to find the location of the $p/p_0 = 0.5$ front via linear interpolation, and the difference between the two schemes is computed. The provided Python code correctly implements this logic.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import solve_banded\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 1D poroelasticity problem for monolithic and split schemes,\n    and computes the splitting-induced phase error.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Physical Parameters ---\n    L = 1.0  # m, domain length\n    p0 = 1.0e5  # Pa, left boundary pressure\n    Kd = 2.0e9  # Pa, drained bulk modulus\n    G = 1.0e9  # Pa, shear modulus\n    kappa = 1.0e-18  # m^2, permeability\n    mu = 1.0e-3  # Pa.s, dynamic viscosity\n    \n    # Derived physical constants\n    lame_lambda = Kd - (2.0 / 3.0) * G\n    H = lame_lambda + 2.0 * G  # 1D P-wave modulus\n    D = kappa / mu  # Hydraulic conductance term\n\n    # --- Numerical Parameters ---\n    Nx = 201  # number of spatial nodes\n    x_nodes = np.linspace(0, L, Nx)\n    dx = L / (Nx - 1)\n    \n    T_end = 3.6e5  # s, final time\n    Nt = 240  # number of time steps\n    dt = T_end / Nt\n\n    # --- Test Cases ---\n    test_cases = [\n        # (alpha, M)\n        (0.0, 1.0e9),   # Case 1: No coupling\n        (0.2, 1.0e9),   # Case 2: Weak coupling\n        (0.8, 1.0e9),   # Case 3: Stronger coupling\n        (0.8, 1.0e10),  # Case 4: Strong coupling, stiffer fluid\n        (0.8, 5.0e8),   # Case 5: Strong coupling, more compliant fluid\n    ]\n\n    def run_simulation(s_eff):\n        \"\"\"\n        Runs the time-stepping simulation for a given effective storage coefficient.\n        \n        Args:\n            s_eff (float): The effective storage coefficient (S or Sc).\n        \n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: The final pressure profile across all nodes.\n        \"\"\"\n        if s_eff = 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Effective storage coefficient must be positive.\")\n\n        # Dimensionless diffusion number\n        r = (D * dt) / (s_eff * dx**2)\n        \n        # System matrix for internal nodes (size Nx-2 x Nx-2)\n        num_internal_nodes = Nx - 2\n        # `solve_banded` expects a (l+u+1, N) matrix, here (3, Nx-2)\n        ab = np.zeros((3, num_internal_nodes))\n        ab[0, 1:] = -r       # Upper diagonal\n        ab[1, :] = 1.0 + 2.0 * r # Main diagonal\n        ab[2, :-1] = -r      # Lower diagonal\n\n        # Initial condition for internal nodes\n        p_internal = np.zeros(num_internal_nodes)\n        \n        for _ in range(Nt):\n            # Right-hand side is the pressure from the previous step\n            b = p_internal.copy()\n            # Apply Dirichlet BC at x=0\n            b[0] += r * p0\n            \n            # Solve the tridiagonal system for the new pressure\n            p_internal = solve_banded((1, 1), ab, b)\n            \n        # Reconstruct full pressure profile including boundaries\n        p_final = np.concatenate(([p0], p_internal, [0.0]))\n        return p_final\n\n    def find_x_half(p_profile):\n        \"\"\"\n        Finds the location x_0.5 where p/p0 = 0.5 using linear interpolation.\n        \n        Args:\n            p_profile (np.ndarray): The final pressure profile.\n            \n        Returns:\n            float: The interpolated x-location.\n        \"\"\"\n        p_target = 0.5 * p0\n        \n        # Find the first index where pressure drops below the target\n        # The pressure profile is monotonically decreasing from p0 to 0\n        try:\n            j_plus_1 = np.where(p_profile = p_target)[0][0]\n        except IndexError:\n            return L \n\n        j = j_plus_1 - 1\n        \n        p_j = p_profile[j]\n        p_j_plus_1 = p_profile[j_plus_1]\n        \n        x_j = x_nodes[j]\n        \n        # Linear interpolation formula\n        x_0_5 = x_j + dx * (p_target - p_j) / (p_j_plus_1 - p_j)\n        \n        return x_0_5\n\n    results = []\n    for alpha, M in test_cases:\n        # Calculate storage coefficients for the current case\n        S = 1.0 / M\n        Sc = S + (alpha**2) / H # Monolithic (coupled) storage\n\n        # Run monolithic simulation\n        p_final_mono = run_simulation(s_eff=Sc)\n        x_mono = find_x_half(p_final_mono)\n\n        # Run staggered (split) simulation\n        p_final_split = run_simulation(s_eff=S)\n        x_split = find_x_half(p_final_split)\n\n        # Calculate and store the phase error\n        delta_x = x_split - x_mono\n        results.append(delta_x)\n\n    # Format output as specified, rounding to 6 decimal places.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.6f}\" for res in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3577925"}]}
