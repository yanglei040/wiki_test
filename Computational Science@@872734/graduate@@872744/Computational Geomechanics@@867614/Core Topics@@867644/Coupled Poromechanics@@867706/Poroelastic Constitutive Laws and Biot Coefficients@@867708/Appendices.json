The problem is self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental definitions of porosity and volume fractions. The total volume $V$ of a porous medium is the sum of the pore volume $V_p$ and the solid volume $V_s$:\n$$V = V_p + V_s$$\nThe porosity $n$ is defined as the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume:\n$$n = \\frac{V_p}{V}$$\nThe problem considers a deformation from an initial, undeformed reference state (denoted by subscript $0$) to a current state. The initial porosity is $n_0 = \\frac{V_{p0}}{V_0} = 0.25$.\n\nWe seek to find the change in porosity, $\\Delta n = n - n_0$. The current porosity is $n = \\frac{V_p}{V}$. We must express the current volumes $V_p$ and $V$ in terms of the initial volumes and the applied strain.\n\nThe volumetric strain of the solid skeleton, $\\varepsilon_v$, relates the change in total volume, $\\Delta V = V - V_0$, to the initial total volume $V_0$. For small strains, this relationship is:\n$$\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0} = \\frac{V - V_0}{V_0}$$\nFrom this, the current total volume $V$ can be expressed as:\n$$V = V_0 (1 + \\varepsilon_v)$$\nThe problem states that the individual solid grains are incompressible. This is a critical assumption which implies that the volume of the solid phase remains constant throughout the deformation process:\n$$\\Delta V_s = V_s - V_{s0} = 0 \\implies V_s = V_{s0}$$\nThe change in total volume $\\Delta V$ can be decomposed into the change in pore volume $\\Delta V_p$ and the change in solid volume $\\Delta V_s$:\n$$\\Delta V = \\Delta V_p + \\Delta V_s$$\nApplying the grain incompressibility condition ($\\Delta V_s = 0$), we find that the change in pore volume is equal to the change in total volume:\n$$\\Delta V_p = \\Delta V = V_0 \\varepsilon_v$$\nNow we can express the current pore volume $V_p$ in terms of initial quantities:\n$$V_p = V_{p0} + \\Delta V_p$$\nUsing the definition of initial porosity, $V_{p0} = n_0 V_0$, we have:\n$$V_p = n_0 V_0 + V_0 \\varepsilon_v = V_0 (n_0 + \\varepsilon_v)$$\nWe now have expressions for the current total volume $V$ and the current pore volume $V_p$. We can compute the current porosity $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{V_p}{V} = \\frac{V_0(n_0 + \\varepsilon_v)}{V_0(1 + \\varepsilon_v)} = \\frac{n_0 + \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v}$$\nThe change in porosity $\\Delta n$ is therefore:\n$$\\Delta n = n - n_0 = \\frac{n_0 + \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v} - n_0$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta n = \\frac{(n_0 + \\varepsilon_v) - n_0(1 + \\varepsilon_v)}{1 + \\varepsilon_v} = \\frac{n_0 + \\varepsilon_v - n_0 - n_0 \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v}$$\n$$\\Delta n = \\frac{\\varepsilon_v - n_0 \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v} = \\frac{(1 - n_0) \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v}$$\nThis is the exact expression for the change in porosity under the given assumptions. The problem, however, asks for the *first-order* change in porosity. Since the analysis is in the small-strain regime ($|\\varepsilon_v| \\ll 1$), we can linearize this expression with respect to $\\varepsilon_v$. We use the first-order Taylor series expansion for the term $\\frac{1}{1 + \\varepsilon_v}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{1 + \\varepsilon_v} \\approx 1 - \\varepsilon_v \\quad \\text{for } |\\varepsilon_v| \\ll 1$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta n$:\n$$\\Delta n \\approx (1 - n_0) \\varepsilon_v (1 - \\varepsilon_v) = (1 - n_0) (\\varepsilon_v - \\varepsilon_v^2)$$\nRetaining only the terms that are first-order in $\\varepsilon_v$, we obtain the final expression for the first-order change in porosity:\n$$\\Delta n \\approx (1 - n_0) \\varepsilon_v$$\nThis result is derived purely from kinematic considerations as required. The physical conditions of constant pore pressure and the value of the fluid bulk modulus $K_f$ serve to define a drained loading path, but the numerical values are not required for this specific calculation.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the first-order expression:\n- Initial porosity: $n_0 = 0.25$\n- Volumetric strain: $\\varepsilon_v = -0.01$\n\n$$\\Delta n = (1 - 0.25) \\times (-0.01)$$\n$$\\Delta n = 0.75 \\times (-0.01)$$\n$$\\Delta n = -0.0075$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the porosity decreases, which is consistent with the applied compaction ($\\varepsilon_v < 0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.0075}$$", "id": "3551703"}, {"introduction": "While linear poroelasticity provides a powerful theoretical framework, real geomaterials often exhibit nonlinear behavior where their properties change with stress, strain, or pressure.

I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Governing Relationships**\n\nThe theory of linear, isotropic poroelasticity is founded on a set of constitutive relations. For an isotropic change in mean total stress $d\\sigma$ and pore pressure $dp$, the change in volumetric strain $d\\varepsilon_v$ and the change in fluid content $d\\zeta$ (volume of fluid introduced per unit reference volume) are given by:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} d\\sigma' = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma - \\alpha dp) \\quad (1)$$\n$$d\\zeta = \\alpha d\\varepsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} dp \\quad (2)$$\nwhere $d\\sigma' = d\\sigma - \\alpha dp$ is the change in effective stress. The parameters are defined from the material's constituents:\nThe Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ is defined as:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} \\quad (3)$$\nThe Biot modulus $M$ is defined by the storage relation:\n$$\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha - \\phi}{K_s} \\quad (4)$$\n\nFor an undrained test, there is no fluid mass exchange with the exterior, so $d\\zeta = 0$. From equation ($2$), this gives:\n$$\\alpha d\\varepsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} dp = 0 \\implies dp = -\\alpha M d\\varepsilon_v$$\nSubstituting this into equation ($1$):\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma - \\alpha(-\\alpha M d\\varepsilon_v)) = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma + \\alpha^2 M d\\varepsilon_v)$$\nRearranging for $d\\varepsilon_v$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2 M}{K_d}\\right) = \\frac{d\\sigma}{K_d} \\implies d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{d\\sigma}{K_d - \\alpha^2 M}$$\nThis relationship is usually expressed in terms of the undrained bulk modulus, $K_u = d\\sigma/d\\varepsilon_v$ (for an undrained test). However, from the derivation, a negative sign appears depending on convention. Standard literature gives the relationship as:\n$$K_u = K_d + \\alpha^2 M \\quad (5)$$\nSkempton's coefficient $B$ is the ratio of induced pore pressure change to the change in total stress under undrained conditions, $B = (dp/d\\sigma)_{\\text{undrained}}$.\n$$\\frac{dp}{d\\sigma} = \\frac{dp}{d\\varepsilon_v} \\frac{d\\varepsilon_v}{d\\sigma} = (\\alpha M) \\frac{1}{K_u}$$\nSo, we have:\n$$B = \\frac{\\alpha M}{K_u} \\quad (6)$$\nCombining ($5$) and ($6$): $B = \\frac{\\alpha M}{K_d + \\alpha^2 M}$.\n\n**Calibration 1: Low-Strain Ultrasonic Regime**\n\nUsing the data for the low-strain regime: $K_d = 10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $K_s = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\phi = 0.20$, and $K_f = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the Biot coefficient $\\alpha_{low}$:\n$$\\alpha_{low} = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} = 1 - \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = 1 - 0.277\\overline{7} = 0.722\\overline{2}$$\nNext, calculate the Biot modulus $M_{low}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{M_{low}} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha_{low} - \\phi}{K_s} = \\frac{0.20}{2.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{0.722\\overline{2} - 0.20}{36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{M_{low}} = 0.0909\\overline{09}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} + \\frac{0.522\\overline{2}}{36}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = 0.0909\\overline{09}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} + 0.014506\\overline{1}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = 0.105415\\overline{15}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$$\n$$M_{low} = \\frac{1}{0.105415\\overline{15}}\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\approx 9.486\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nSo, the low-strain calibration yields: $\\alpha_{low} \\approx 0.722$ and $M_{low} \\approx 9.49\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\n**Inference from High-Strain Undrained Triaxial Data**\n\nUsing the data from the high-strain regime: $K_u = 13\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $B = 0.60$, $\\phi = 0.20$, $K_s = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, and $K_f = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$. We want to infer the implied skeleton modulus $K_{d,high}$ and the corresponding $\\alpha_{high}$ and $M_{high}$.\n\nFrom equation ($6$), we find the product $\\alpha M$:\n$$\\alpha_{high} M_{high} = B \\cdot K_u = 0.60 \\times 13\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nNow we have a system of three equations for $\\alpha_{high}$, $M_{high}$, and $K_{d,high}$:\n1. $\\alpha_{high} M_{high} = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n2. $\\alpha_{high} = 1 - K_{d,high}/36$\n3. $1/M_{high} = 0.20/2.5 + (\\alpha_{high} - 0.20)/36$\n\nFrom (1), $M_{high} = 7.8 / \\alpha_{high}$. Substitute this into (3):\n$$\\frac{\\alpha_{high}}{7.8} = \\frac{0.20}{2.5} + \\frac{\\alpha_{high} - 0.20}{36}$$\n$$\\frac{\\alpha_{high}}{7.8} = 0.08 + \\frac{\\alpha_{high}}{36} - \\frac{0.20}{36}$$\nRearrange to solve for $\\alpha_{high}$:\n$$\\alpha_{high} \\left(\\frac{1}{7.8} - \\frac{1}{36}\\right) = 0.08 - \\frac{0.20}{36}$$\n$$\\alpha_{high} (0.128205... - 0.027777...) = 0.08 - 0.005555...$$\n$$\\alpha_{high} (0.100427...) = 0.074444...$$\n$$\\alpha_{high} = \\frac{0.074444...}{0.100427...} \\approx 0.7413$$\nNow, find $K_{d,high}$ from equation (2):\n$$K_{d,high} = K_s (1 - \\alpha_{high}) = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\times (1 - 0.7413) = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\times 0.2587 \\approx 9.31\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nFinally, find $M_{high}$ from equation (1):\n$$M_{high} = \\frac{7.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{\\alpha_{high}} = \\frac{7.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{0.7413} \\approx 10.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nThe high-strain analysis implies: $K_{d,high} \\approx 9.31\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\alpha_{high} \\approx 0.741$, and $M_{high} \\approx 10.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\n**Contrast and Analysis**\n\nLet's summarize the parameters from the two regimes:\n- **Low-Strain:** $K_{d,low} = 10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\alpha_{low} \\approx 0.722$, $M_{low} \\approx 9.49\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ (with $K_f = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$)\n- **High-Strain:** $K_{d,high} \\approx 9.31\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\alpha_{high} \\approx 0.741$, $M_{high} \\approx 10.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ (with $K_f = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$)\n\nComparison reveals:\n1.  **Drained Bulk Modulus:** $K_{d,high} < K_{d,low}$. The drained skeleton *softens* (its bulk modulus decreases) at higher volumetric compressive strain. This is physically plausible due to microcrack growth or grain rearrangement.\n2.  **Biot Coefficient:** $\\alpha_{high} > \\alpha_{low}$. Since $\\alpha = 1 - K_d/K_s$, the decrease in $K_d$ causes an increase in $\\alpha$.\n3.  **Biot Modulus:** $M_{high} > M_{low}$. This is due to two competing effects in the formula $1/M = \\phi/K_f + (\\alpha-\\phi)/K_s$. The fluid stiffens ($K_f$ increases from $2.2$ to $2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$), which decreases the term $\\phi/K_f$ and thus tends to increase $M$. The Biot coefficient also increases, which increases the term $(\\alpha-\\phi)/K_s$ and tends to decrease $M$. The dominant effect here is the stiffening of the fluid.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options by comparing the measured undrained data ($K_u = 13\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $B = 0.60$) with a prediction based on the low-strain rock properties ($K_{d,low}=10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\alpha_{low}=0.722$) but using the fluid properties of the high-strain test ($K_f=2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$).\nFirst, calculate the predicted Biot modulus $M_{pred}$ under these conditions:\n$$\\frac{1}{M_{pred}} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha_{low} - \\phi}{K_s} = \\frac{0.20}{2.5} + \\frac{0.7222 - 0.20}{36} = 0.08 + 0.0145 = 0.0945\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$$\n$$M_{pred} \\approx 10.58\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nNow, predict the undrained properties $K_{u,pred}$ and $B_{pred}$:\n$$K_{u,pred} = K_{d,low} + \\alpha_{low}^2 M_{pred} = 10\\,\\mathrm{GPa} + (0.7222)^2 (10.58\\,\\mathrm{GPa}) = 10 + 5.52 = 15.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\n$$B_{pred} = \\frac{\\alpha_{low} M_{pred}}{K_{u,pred}} = \\frac{0.7222 \\times 10.58}{15.52} \\approx 0.492$$\n\nComparing the measurement with this linear prediction:\n- **Undrained Modulus:** $K_{u,meas} (13\\,\\mathrm{GPa})$ is lower than $K_{u,pred} (\\approx 15.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa})$.\n- **Skempton's B:** $B_{meas} (0.60)$ is higher than $B_{pred} (\\approx 0.49)$.\nThe discrepancy is that the high-strain measurement shows a softer undrained response and greater pore pressure generation than predicted by the low-strain model.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **The drained skeleton bulk modulus $K_d(\\varepsilon_v)$ softens (decreases) at high volumetric strain, increasing $\\alpha$, while the fluid stiffens with pressure so $M(p)$ increases slightly; the combined effect reduces $K_u$ and increases $B$ in the undrained triaxial data compared to the low-strain ultrasonic-based prediction.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with my analysis.\n- $K_d$ softens ($10 \\to 9.31\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$). **Correct**.\n- $\\alpha$ increases ($0.722 \\to 0.741$). **Correct**.\n- Fluid stiffens ($K_f: 2.2 \\to 2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$) and $M$ increases ($9.49 \\to 10.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$). **Correct**.\n- The result is that the measured $K_u$ is lower than the prediction, and the measured $B$ is higher.

By calculating the discrete inf-sup indicator for a simple case [@problem_id:3551685], you will gain insight into the crucial stability conditions required for reliable computational modeling of coupled poroelastic phenomena.", "problem": "You are asked to derive, discretize, and evaluate a mixed formulation for small-strain poroelasticity with displacement–pressure primary variables. Your derivation must begin from fundamental balance laws, kinematics, and constitutive relations. You must identify the bilinear forms that contain the drained elasticity tensor, the Biot effective stress coefficient, and the Biot modulus, and then implement a program that computes a discrete inf–sup indicator for a minimal, exactly integrable one-dimensional discretization.\n\nDerivation base:\n- Kinematics: The small-strain tensor is defined by $ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}\\right) $.\n- Mechanical equilibrium (quasi-static, no inertia): $ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{0} $ in the domain, with prescribed essential boundary conditions on part of the boundary and natural boundary conditions elsewhere.\n- Pore pressure coupling: The Cauchy total stress is $ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\prime} - \\alpha p \\mathbf{I} $, where the effective stress obeys $ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\prime} = \\mathbb{C}^{d} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) $, with $ \\mathbb{C}^{d} $ the drained elasticity tensor, $ \\alpha \\in [0,1] $ the Biot effective stress coefficient, and $ \\mathbf{I} $ the identity tensor.\n- Fluid mass conservation: The fluid content increment is $ \\zeta = \\alpha \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + \\frac{1}{M} p $, where $ M > 0 $ is the Biot modulus.

It is based on the established principles of linear poroelasticity, is self-contained with all necessary definitions, and is mathematically and physically consistent. The specified task is a standard exercise in computational geomechanics, involving derivation, discretization, and stability analysis.\n\n### Task A: Derivation of the Mixed Weak Form\n\nThe derivation of the mixed weak form for the coupled poroelasticity problem begins with the fundamental balance laws provided. We seek a solution pair $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ in suitable function spaces $V$ and $Q$, where $\\mathbf{u}$ is the solid displacement and $p$ is the pore fluid pressure.\n\n**1. Mechanical Equilibrium Weak Form**\n\nThe quasi-static equilibrium equation is given by:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nWe obtain the weak form by multiplying by a vector test function $\\mathbf{v}$ from an appropriate space $V_0$ (where essential boundary conditions are satisfied) and integrating over the domain $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{f} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, d\\Omega = 0 $$\nApplying integration by parts (Green's first identity) to the first term yields:\n$$ -\\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{v} \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, dS + \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{f} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, d\\Omega = 0 $$\nGiven the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, we have $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\nabla\\mathbf{v} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{v})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + \\nabla \\mathbf{v}^{\\top})$ is the symmetric gradient. The boundary integral $\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, dS$ vanishes on the part of the boundary with essential (Dirichlet) conditions where $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$, and equals the work done by prescribed tractions $\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}$ on the natural (Neumann) boundary. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{v}) \\, d\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{f} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\bar{\\mathbf{t}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, dS $$\nWe now substitute the constitutive relation for the total stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\prime} - \\alpha p \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\prime} = \\mathbb{C}^{d} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u})$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\mathbb{C}^{d} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) - \\alpha p \\mathbf{I}) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{v}) \\, d\\Omega = L_u(\\mathbf{v}) $$\nwhere $L_u(\\mathbf{v})$ represents the linear form for external work. Using the property $\\mathbf{I} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{v})) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$, we arrive at the first weak equation:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{v}) : \\mathbb{C}^{d} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) \\, d\\Omega - \\int_{\\Omega} \\alpha p (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\, d\\Omega = L_u(\\mathbf{v}) $$\n\n**2. Fluid Mass Conservation Weak Form**\n\nThe fluid mass balance is given by $\\dot{\\zeta} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = s$, where the fluid content increment is $\\zeta = \\alpha \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + \\frac{1}{M} p$. Substituting $\\zeta$ and the Darcy flux $\\mathbf{w} = -\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\nabla p$ into the balance law gives the strong form for pressure:\n$$ \\alpha \\nabla \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{u}} + \\frac{1}{M} \\dot{p} - \\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\nabla p) = s $$\nWe multiply by a scalar test function $q$ from a suitable space $Q$ and integrate over $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} q \\left( \\alpha \\nabla \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{u}} + \\frac{1}{M} \\dot{p} \\right) d\\Omega - \\int_{\\Omega} q \\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\nabla p) \\, d\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega} q s \\, d\\Omega $$\nApplying integration by parts to the flux term gives:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla q \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\nabla p) \\, d\\Omega - \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} q (\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dS $$\nThe term $-(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) = \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ is the fluid flux across the boundary. Prescribing this flux constitutes a natural boundary condition. The resulting second weak equation is:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} q \\alpha (\\nabla \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{u}}) \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega} q \\frac{1}{M} \\dot{p} \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla q \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\nabla p \\, d\\Omega = L_p(q) $$\nwhere $L_p(q)$ is the linear form for fluid sources and boundary fluxes.\n\n**3. Identification of Bilinear Forms**\n\nThe problem's focus is on the inf-sup condition, which analyzes the stability of the static part of the system operator. We identify the relevant bilinear forms from the time-independent parts of the weak formulation:\n- The mechanical stiffness bilinear form, involving the drained elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}^{d}$:\n$$ a(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{v}) : \\mathbb{C}^{d} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) \\, d\\Omega $$\n- The coupling bilinear form, involving the Biot coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$ b(\\mathbf{u}, q) = \\int_{\\Omega} q \\alpha (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\, d\\Omega $$\n(Note that the corresponding term in the mechanical equation is $-b(\\mathbf{v}, p)$).\n- The storage bilinear form, involving the Biot modulus $M$:\n$$ c(p, q) = \\int_{\\Omega} q \\frac{1}{M} p \\, d\\Omega $$\n\n### Task B: Discrete Inf-Sup Condition\n\nFor a mixed finite element formulation to be stable, the discrete function spaces for displacement, $V_h \\subset V$, and pressure, $Q_h \\subset Q$, must satisfy the discrete inf-sup (or Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi, LBB) condition. This ensures that the coupling between the variables is properly resolved at the discrete level.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{v}_h$ and $\\mathbf{q}_h$ be the vectors of nodal degrees of freedom for discrete functions $v_h \\in V_h$ and $q_h \\in Q_h$, respectively. The discrete norms induced by the mechanical stiffness and storage bilinear forms are:\n$$ \\|\\mathbf{v}_{h}\\|_{\\mathbf{A}} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{v}_{h}^{\\top} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v}_{h}} = \\sqrt{a(v_h, v_h)} $$\n$$ \\|q_{h}\\|_{\\mathbf{C}} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{q}_{h}^{\\top} \\mathbf{C} q_{h}} = \\sqrt{c(q_h, q_h)} $$\nThe discrete inf-sup condition states that there must exist a constant $\\beta_h > 0$ (ideally, bounded below by a constant independent of the mesh size $h$) such that:\n$$ \\inf_{q_h \\in Q_h \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\sup_{v_h \\in V_h \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{b(v_h, q_h)}{\\|v_h\\|_{A} \\|q_h\\|_{C}} \\geq \\beta_h $$\nThe problem provides a direct way to compute this constant for the discrete system as the smallest singular value of a specially constructed matrix:\n$$ \\beta_{h} = \\sigma_{\\min}\\!\\left( \\mathbf{C}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}^{-1/2} \\right) $$\n\n### Task C: One-Dimensional Single-Element Calculation\n\nWe now specialize the problem to a single one-dimensional element over the domain $\\Omega = (0, L)$.\n\n**1. Discretization and Basis Functions**\n- **Displacement:** A single two-node linear element is used. The displacement is $u(x) = u_1 N_1(x) + u_2 N_2(x)$, with $N_1(x) = 1 - x/L$ and $N_2(x) = x/L$. The essential boundary condition $u(0)=0$ implies $u_1=0$. Thus, the discrete displacement space is one-dimensional, spanned by the single basis function $\\phi_1(x) = N_2(x) = x/L$. Its derivative is $\\frac{d\\phi_1}{dx} = 1/L$. The dimension is $n_u=1$.\n- **Pressure:** A single piecewise constant basis function is used. The basis function is $\\psi_1(x) = 1$ for $x \\in (0, L)$. The discrete pressure space is also one-dimensional ($n_p=1$).\n\n**2. Assembly of Discrete Matrices**\nThe matrices $\\mathbf{A}$, $\\mathbf{B}$, and $\\mathbf{C}$ are all $1 \\times 1$ scalars.\n\n- **Stiffness Matrix $\\mathbf{A}$:** The 1D version of $a(u,v)$ is $\\int_0^L E \\frac{du}{dx} \\frac{dv}{dx} dx$.\n$$ A_{11} = \\int_0^L E \\left(\\frac{d\\phi_1}{dx}\\right)^2 dx = \\int_0^L E \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)^2 dx = \\frac{E}{L^2} \\int_0^L dx = \\frac{E}{L} $$\nSo, $\\mathbf{A} = [E/L]$.\n\n- **Coupling Matrix $\\mathbf{B}$:** The 1D version of $b(v,q)$ is $\\int_0^L q \\alpha \\frac{dv}{dx} dx$.\n$$ B_{11} = \\int_0^L \\psi_1(x) \\alpha \\frac{d\\phi_1}{dx} dx = \\int_0^L 1 \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{1}{L} dx = \\frac{\\alpha}{L} \\int_0^L dx = \\alpha $$\nSo, $\\mathbf{B} = [\\alpha]$.\n\n- **Storage Matrix $\\mathbf{C}$:** The 1D version of $c(p,q)$ is $\\int_0^L q \\frac{1}{M} p dx$.\n$$ C_{11} = \\int_0^L \\psi_1(x) \\frac{1}{M} \\psi_1(x) dx = \\int_0^L 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{M} \\cdot 1 dx = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L dx = \\frac{L}{M} $$\nSo, $\\mathbf{C} = [L/M]$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Inf-Sup Indicator $\\beta_h$**\nWe use the formula $\\beta_{h} = \\sigma_{\\min}\\!\\left( \\mathbf{C}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}^{-1/2} \\right)$. Since the matrices are scalars, we replace them with their values:\n$$ \\mathbf{A}^{-1/2} = (E/L)^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{L/E} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{C}^{-1/2} = (L/M)^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{M/L} $$\nThe operator $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{C}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}^{-1/2}$ becomes the scalar:\n$$ S = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{M}{L}}\\right) (\\alpha) \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{E}}\\right) = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{L} \\frac{L}{E}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{E}} $$\nThe smallest singular value of a scalar is its absolute value. As $\\alpha \\ge 0$, $M > 0$, and $E > 0$, all quantities are non-negative.\n$$ \\beta_h = |S| = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{E}} $$\nThis analytic result allows for the direct computation of the discrete inf-sup indicator for the given test cases.
