## Introduction
The volume change that accompanies the shearing of [granular materials](@entry_id:750005) like sand and soil, a phenomenon known as [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001), is a fundamental characteristic that governs their mechanical behavior. Understanding this coupling between [shear deformation](@entry_id:170920) and volumetric strain is critical for predicting the strength, stability, and flow of [geomaterials](@entry_id:749838) in engineering applications. However, bridging the gap from microscopic particle interactions to a predictive macroscopic theory poses a significant challenge. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001), equipping readers with the theoretical foundation and practical knowledge essential for advanced studies in [computational geomechanics](@entry_id:747617).

The following chapters will guide you through this complex topic. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms"**, lays the groundwork by defining [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001), examining its micromechanical origins in particle interlocking and force chain instability, and introducing the macroscopic framework of Critical State Soil Mechanics. Next, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** explores the profound consequences of [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001), from its contribution to shear strength and its role in undrained soil behavior like [liquefaction](@entry_id:184829), to its complex implementation in advanced [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726). Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section provides an opportunity to apply these concepts through guided problems, reinforcing your understanding of how to analyze experimental data and implement [numerical algorithms](@entry_id:752770) for elastoplastic models.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The shearing of [granular materials](@entry_id:750005) such as sand, soil, and powders is frequently accompanied by a change in volume. This coupling between [shear deformation](@entry_id:170920) and [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252) is a defining characteristic of the granular state, with profound implications for the strength, stability, and flow of these materials. This phenomenon, known as **dilatancy**, is fundamentally a consequence of the particulate nature of the medium and the geometric constraints imposed by particle packing. This chapter will elucidate the principles governing [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001), from its micromechanical origins to its description within macroscopic continuum frameworks, and finally to its mathematical formulation in [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726) used in [computational geomechanics](@entry_id:747617).

### Defining Dilatancy: Kinematics and Conventions

At its core, **dilatancy** is the [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252) that is irrecoverably induced by deviatoric (shear) deformation. It is crucial to distinguish this phenomenon from other sources of volume change. **Compressibility**, for instance, refers to the reversible (elastic) volumetric strain that occurs in response to changes in the mean stress, a property quantified by the material's bulk modulus. **Compaction** or **consolidation**, on the other hand, typically refers to the irreversible volume decrease resulting from an increase in [mean effective stress](@entry_id:751815), which closes voids and rearranges particles into a denser state. Dilatancy, in contrast, is specifically the volume change that arises as a consequence of shearing, even under conditions of constant [mean stress](@entry_id:751819) [@problem_id:3517374]. A dense sand specimen sheared in a drained triaxial test provides a canonical example: as the specimen is compressed axially and allowed to expand radially, it will initially contract slightly before exhibiting a significant and sustained increase in volume. This volume increase, occurring under shear at a nearly constant [mean effective stress](@entry_id:751815), is the signature of dilatancy.

To discuss dilatancy quantitatively, we must first establish clear kinematic definitions and sign conventions. Within the framework of [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125), the total strain tensor, $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$, is additively decomposed into its elastic and plastic parts:
$$
d\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = d\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^e + d\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^p
$$
This decomposition applies to both the volumetric and deviatoric components of strain. The **[volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252)**, $\varepsilon_v$, is defined as the trace of the [strain tensor](@entry_id:193332), $\varepsilon_v = \operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}) = \varepsilon_{kk}$. It represents the fractional change in volume of a material element. The sign convention for [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252) can be a source of confusion. In general continuum mechanics, expansion (volume increase) is taken as positive, and compression (volume decrease) is negative. However, in [soil mechanics](@entry_id:180264) and geotechnical engineering, the opposite convention is standard: compression is considered **positive**, and dilation (expansion) is **negative**. We will adhere to the [geomechanics](@entry_id:175967) convention (compression positive) throughout this text unless otherwise noted [@problem_id:3517374].

Dilatancy is an irreversible phenomenon and is therefore captured by the plastic part of the [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252), $d\varepsilon_v^p$. The magnitude of shear is quantified by a scalar measure of the deviatoric part of the strain tensor, often termed the **equivalent shear strain**, $\varepsilon_s$. A common definition, work-conjugate to the von Mises [equivalent stress](@entry_id:749064), is $\varepsilon_s = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3} e_{ij}e_{ij}}$, where $e_{ij} = \varepsilon_{ij} - \frac{1}{3}\varepsilon_v\delta_{ij}$ is the [deviatoric strain](@entry_id:201263) tensor [@problem_id:3517440].

The coupling between plastic shear and plastic volume change is quantified by the **[dilatancy angle](@entry_id:748435)**, $\psi$. It is defined through the ratio of the rate of plastic [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252) to the rate of plastic [shear strain](@entry_id:175241):
$$
\tan\psi = - \frac{d\varepsilon_v^p}{d\varepsilon_s^p}
$$
The negative sign in this definition is critical and is chosen to align with the physical meaning under the [geomechanics](@entry_id:175967) sign convention [@problem_id:3517440]. When a dense material dilates, its volume increases, meaning the compressive volumetric strain *decreases*, so $d\varepsilon_v^p  0$. Since shearing proceeds with $d\varepsilon_s^p > 0$, the ratio $d\varepsilon_v^p/d\varepsilon_s^p$ is negative. The negative sign in the definition of $\tan\psi$ ensures that a positive [dilatancy angle](@entry_id:748435), $\psi > 0$, corresponds to dilation. Conversely, when a loose material contracts under shear, $d\varepsilon_v^p > 0$, resulting in a negative [dilatancy angle](@entry_id:748435), $\psi  0$. A material that shears at constant volume has $\psi = 0$.

### The Micromechanical View: Interlocking, Force Chains, and Instability

The continuum description of dilatancy emerges from complex interactions at the particle scale. To understand why dilatancy occurs, consider a dense, random assembly of frictional particles. The particles are highly **interlocked**, meaning there is very little free volume available for them to move into. When a shear deformation is imposed, particles cannot simply slide past one another along flat planes. Instead, to accommodate the macroscopic shear, they are forced to "ride up" and over their neighbors. This microscopic climbing motion forces particles apart, increasing the average void space and resulting in a macroscopic expansion of the material.

This mechanism is only possible if certain conditions at the particle contacts are met [@problem_id:3517436]. First, there must be sufficient **interparticle friction**, characterized by a friction coefficient $\mu$. Friction resists the easy sliding of particles past one another. Without friction, particles could rearrange more freely, and the strong kinematic constraint leading to dilation would be absent. Second, the contacts must possess some tangential stiffness, allowing them to transmit shear forces before sliding occurs. This enables the formation of a load-bearing network. In a dense packing under shear, the applied stress is not carried uniformly. Instead, it becomes concentrated along quasi-linear paths of particles in strong contact, known as **[force chains](@entry_id:199587)**. These chains preferentially align with the major principal compressive stress direction and form the skeleton of the material [@problem_id:3517406].

Dilatancy can be understood as a consequence of the instability of these [force chains](@entry_id:199587). An idealized force chain can be viewed as a slender column subjected to a large axial compressive force, supported laterally by the surrounding, weaker network of particles. As the shear load increases, the compressive force on the chain grows. Eventually, this force reaches a critical threshold, and the chain **buckles**, deflecting laterally. This [buckling](@entry_id:162815) is a microscopic instability that triggers a local, non-affine rearrangement of particles. The lateral motion of the buckling particles pushes neighbors aside, creating new void space and reducing the local [coordination number](@entry_id:143221). This collective, unstable rearrangement, repeated throughout the material, is the fundamental microscopic mechanism of dilatancy. The macroscopic result is a net increase in volume, which requires the external shear work to perform work against the confining pressure [@problem_id:3517406].

The shape of the particles plays a critical role in this process. Assemblies of angular, irregular particles (like crushed sand) exhibit much stronger interlocking than assemblies of spherical particles (like glass beads). Angular particles cannot roll easily over one another. This suppressed rotational degree of freedom enhances the geometric constraints, forcing a more pronounced dilative response for a given amount of shear. In Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, this effect is often modeled by introducing a **[rolling resistance](@entry_id:754415)** at contacts, which opposes the relative rotation of particles [@problem_id:3517372]. Consequently, for the same initial density, an assembly of angular grains will typically exhibit a higher peak strength and a greater magnitude of [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001) compared to an assembly of spherical grains.

### The Macroscopic Framework: Critical State Soil Mechanics

While [micromechanics](@entry_id:195009) provides a physical explanation, a predictive macroscopic framework is needed for engineering analysis. **Critical State Soil Mechanics (CSSM)** provides such a framework by positing that, regardless of its initial state, a granular material subjected to continuous shear will eventually evolve towards a single, well-defined **[critical state](@entry_id:160700)**.

The critical state is a state of [dynamic equilibrium](@entry_id:136767) characterized by continuous shearing at constant volume, constant [mean effective stress](@entry_id:751815) ($p'$), and constant deviatoric stress ($q$) [@problem_id:3517447]. The condition of "constant volume" implies that the rate of plastic [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252) is zero, $d\varepsilon_v^p = 0$. In this state, the material's internal fabric (the statistical distribution of contacts and voids) has reached a steady configuration where the creation of voids by particle rearrangement is exactly balanced by their collapse. Because [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001) is the net production of [volumetric strain](@entry_id:267252) during shear, it must necessarily vanish at the critical state. The material flows like a frictional fluid, deforming without any further net change in density.

In the space of void ratio ($e$) and [mean effective stress](@entry_id:751815) ($p'$), the locus of all critical states forms the **Critical State Line (CSL)**. For many soils, particularly over a limited pressure range, the CSL can be approximated by a straight line in the $e - \ln(p')$ plane:
$$
e_{cs}(p') = \Gamma - \lambda \ln\left(\frac{p'}{p'_r}\right)
$$
Here, $e_{cs}(p')$ is the critical state void ratio at [mean effective stress](@entry_id:751815) $p'$, while $\Gamma$, $\lambda$, and $p'_r$ are material constants [@problem_id:3517380].

The CSL serves as the ultimate destination for all shearing paths. The volumetric behavior of a soil is determined by its current state relative to this line. This relationship is quantified by the **state parameter**, $\psi_s$, defined as the vertical distance between the current state $(p', e)$ and the CSL:
$$
\psi_s = e - e_{cs}(p')
$$
The state parameter is a powerful concept that unifies the influence of both density and confining pressure into a single variable [@problem_id:3517408]. The sign of $\psi_s$ predicts the initial volumetric response of the material:
-   **$\psi_s  0$**: The material is denser than its [critical state](@entry_id:160700) at the current pressure. To reach the CSL, it must expand. Therefore, it will exhibit **dilative** behavior ($d\varepsilon_v^p  0$).
-   **$\psi_s > 0$**: The material is looser than its [critical state](@entry_id:160700). To reach the CSL, it must compact. Therefore, it will exhibit **contractive** behavior ($d\varepsilon_v^p > 0$).

This framework explains key observed behaviors. Consider a dense sand with an initial void ratio of $e_0 = 0.68$. If sheared at a low confining pressure of $p'_0 = 100 \text{ kPa}$, it may be dense of critical (e.g., $\psi_s  0$) and will dilate. If the same sand is sheared at a high confining pressure of $p'_0 = 800 \text{ kPa}$, the CSL is lower, and the state parameter becomes less negative or even positive. This means the material is now closer to, or even looser than, the [critical state](@entry_id:160700) for that higher pressure. Consequently, the magnitude of [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001) is suppressed, or the behavior may even switch to contractive [@problem_id:3517380]. This pressure-dependent suppression of [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001) is a cornerstone of granular mechanics.

Furthermore, the state parameter also predicts the response in undrained shearing, where the total volume cannot change. A contractive tendency ($\psi_s > 0$) will lead to a transfer of stress from the soil skeleton to the pore fluid, generating positive excess [pore pressure](@entry_id:188528). Conversely, a dilative tendency ($\psi_s  0$) will cause the soil skeleton to expand against the incompressible pore fluid, generating negative excess pore pressure (suction) [@problem_id:3517408].

### Constitutive Modeling: Non-Associated Plasticity

To implement these principles in computational models, we turn to the theory of [elastoplasticity](@entry_id:193198). A complete model requires a yield function, a [flow rule](@entry_id:177163), and a [hardening law](@entry_id:750150). The direction of the plastic strain increment is governed by the **[flow rule](@entry_id:177163)**. The rule states that the plastic strain rate vector is normal to the surface of a **plastic [potential function](@entry_id:268662)**, $g(\boldsymbol{\sigma}')$. This is known as the **[normality rule](@entry_id:182635)**.

For a formulation in terms of [stress invariants](@entry_id:170526) $(p', q)$ and their work-conjugate strain rates $(\dot{\varepsilon}_v, \dot{\varepsilon}_s)$, the [normality rule](@entry_id:182635) implies that the vector $(\dot{\varepsilon}_v^p, \dot{\varepsilon}_s^p)$ is normal to the contours of $g(p',q)$ in the $(p',q)$ plane. This leads directly to the expression for the [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001) ratio [@problem_id:3517430]:
$$
\frac{d\varepsilon_v^p}{d\varepsilon_s^p} = \frac{\partial g / \partial p'}{\partial g / \partial q}
$$
This equation makes it clear that the plastic [potential function](@entry_id:268662) $g$ directly controls the dilatancy of the material model.

In early plasticity models, it was often assumed that the [plastic potential](@entry_id:164680) was identical to the **yield function**, $f$, which defines the boundary of elastic behavior. This is called an **[associated flow rule](@entry_id:201731)** ($g \equiv f$). For frictional materials like soils, the yield function (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb or Drucker-Prager) has a significant negative slope in the $p'$-$q$ plane. Using an [associated flow rule](@entry_id:201731) would therefore predict a very large amount of [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001), far greater than what is observed experimentally.

To resolve this, modern [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726) for soils almost universally employ a **[non-associated flow rule](@entry_id:172454)**, where the [plastic potential](@entry_id:164680) $g$ is a different function from the yield function $f$ [@problem_id:3517430]. This decoupling allows for the independent calibration of shear strength (governed by $f$) and [dilatancy](@entry_id:201001) (governed by $g$).

A classic example is the non-associated Mohr-Coulomb model. The [yield surface](@entry_id:175331) is defined by the material's cohesion $c$ and **friction angle** $\phi$. The [plastic potential](@entry_id:164680), however, is defined by a separate **[dilatancy angle](@entry_id:748435)** $\psi$ [@problem_id:3517402]. For a simple Drucker-Prager-type model, the [yield function](@entry_id:167970) and [plastic potential](@entry_id:164680) on the triaxial compression meridian might take the forms:
$$
f(p', q) = q - M(\phi)p' - K(\phi, c)
$$
$$
g(p', q) = q - M_\psi(\psi)p'
$$
Here, $M(\phi)$ is the slope of the [yield surface](@entry_id:175331), and $M_\psi(\psi)$ is the slope of the [plastic potential](@entry_id:164680) surface. The friction angle $\phi$ determines when the material will yield, while the [dilatancy angle](@entry_id:748435) $\psi$ determines the volumetric response *during* yield. Applying the [flow rule](@entry_id:177163) to this potential shows that the ratio of plastic volumetric to plastic shear strain depends only on $\psi$. For example, for a [linear potential](@entry_id:160860), the dilatancy is constant. Setting $\psi = 0$ yields a [plastic potential](@entry_id:164680) that is a horizontal line in the $p'$-$q$ plane ($\partial g / \partial p' = 0$), resulting in zero plastic volumetric strain (isochoric flow), regardless of the friction angle $\phi$ [@problem_id:3517402]. This non-associated framework provides the essential flexibility needed to accurately capture the complex, pressure-dependent, and density-dependent dilatant behavior of [granular materials](@entry_id:750005) in computational simulations.
