The Drucker-Prager model is a classical, well-established model in geomechanics. All provided definitions for stress invariants, elastic laws, plastic flow rules (normality to a plastic potential $g$), and the undrained condition are standard and self-consistent. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary information for a unique derivation from first principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution requires deriving the incremental stress-strain response of the material at yield under undrained conditions. This is achieved by combining the elastic and plastic constitutive laws with the undrained and consistency conditions.\n\nThe total strain increments for volumetric and deviatoric components are given by:\n$$d\\varepsilon_{v} = d\\varepsilon_{v}^{e} + d\\varepsilon_{v}^{p}$$\n$$d\\varepsilon_{s} = d\\varepsilon_{s}^{e} + d\\varepsilon_{s}^{p}$$\n\nThe problem states the undrained condition, $d\\varepsilon_{v} = 0$. Substituting the definitions for the elastic and plastic volumetric strain increments, we have:\n$$d\\varepsilon_{v}^{e} + d\\varepsilon_{v}^{p} = 0$$\nUsing the elastic law $d\\varepsilon_{v}^{e} = dp'/K$ and the plastic flow rule $d\\varepsilon_{v}^{p} = -N\\lambda$, this becomes:\n$$\\frac{dp'}{K} - N\\lambda = 0 \\implies dp' = K N \\lambda$$\nThis equation relates the increment of effective mean stress to the plastic multiplier $\\lambda$.\n\nDuring plastic flow, the stress state must remain on the yield surface. This is enforced by the consistency condition, $df=0$. For the given yield function $f(q,p')=q-M\\,p'-c=0$, the total differential is:\n$$df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} dq + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p'} dp' = (1)dq + (-M)dp' = 0$$\nThis gives a fundamental relationship between the stress increments during plastic yielding:\n$$dq = M dp'$$\n\nNow we evaluate the two specific cases requested.\n\n**Case 1: Non-associated flow with $\\psi=0$**\nFor a dilatancy angle $\\psi=0$, the parameter $N$ becomes:\n$$N = \\frac{6\\,\\sin(0)}{3-\\sin(0)} = 0$$\nSubstituting $N=0$ into the equation for the effective mean stress increment:\n$$dp' = K (0) \\lambda = 0$$\nThis means that for a non-dilatant material ($N=0$), the undrained effective stress path is isochoric, i.e., at constant effective mean stress $p'$. As shearing continues ($d\\varepsilon_s  0$), the deviatoric stress $q$ increases, but $p'$ does not change. The incremental $q$-$p'$ behavior is a vertical path in the $q$-$p'$ plane.\n\n**Case 2: Associated flow with $\\psi=\\phi$**\nFor associated flow, the plastic potential is identical to the yield function, which means $\\psi=\\phi$ and therefore $N=M$.\nThe equation for the effective mean stress increment becomes:\n$$dp' = K M \\lambda$$\nThe consistency condition $dq = M dp'$ is still valid. Combining these two equations tells us about the incremental $q$-$p'$ behavior:\n$$\\frac{dq}{dp'} = M$$\nIn the associated flow case, the undrained effective stress path has a constant slope $M$ in the $q$-$p'$ plane. The stress path moves up along the yield line itself.\n\n**Derivation of the undrained tangent $dq/d\\varepsilon_{s}$ for Associated Flow**\nThe final task is to derive an expression for the tangent stiffness $dq/d\\varepsilon_{s}$ for the associated flow case ($N=M$). We start with the decomposition of the deviatoric strain increment:\n$$d\\varepsilon_{s} = d\\varepsilon_{s}^{e} + d\\varepsilon_{s}^{p}$$\nSubstitute the elastic law $d\\varepsilon_{s}^{e} = dq/(3G)$ and the plastic flow rule $d\\varepsilon_{s}^{p} = \\lambda$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_{s} = \\frac{dq}{3G} + \\lambda$$\nTo find $dq/d\\varepsilon_s$, we must eliminate $\\lambda$. From the associated flow analysis above, we have two key incremental relationships:\n$1$. $dp' = K M \\lambda$\n$2$. $dq = M dp'$\n\nSubstitute the first into the second:\n$$dq = M (K M \\lambda) = K M^2 \\lambda$$\nFrom this, we can express the plastic multiplier $\\lambda$ in terms of the deviatoric stress increment $dq$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{dq}{K M^2}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\lambda$ back into the equation for $d\\varepsilon_s$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_{s} = \\frac{dq}{3G} + \\frac{dq}{K M^2}$$\nFactor out $dq$ from the right-hand side:\n$$d\\varepsilon_{s} = dq \\left( \\frac{1}{3G} + \\frac{1}{K M^2} \\right)$$\nNow, we can solve for the desired tangent modulus $dq/d\\varepsilon_{s}$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$\\frac{dq}{d\\varepsilon_{s}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{3G} + \\frac{1}{K M^2} \\right)^{-1}$$\nTo obtain a single closed-form expression, we find a common denominator for the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\\frac{1}{3G} + \\frac{1}{K M^2} = \\frac{K M^2 + 3G}{3G K M^2}$$\nTaking the reciprocal gives the final expression for the associated-flow undrained tangent at yield:\n$$\\frac{dq}{d\\varepsilon_{s}} = \\frac{3G K M^2}{3G + K M^2}$$\nThis expression relates the increment of deviatoric stress to the increment of total deviatoric strain solely in terms of the material's elastic constants $K$ and $G$ and the plastic friction parameter $M$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3G K M^{2}}{3G + K M^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3549319"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of any numerical simulation involving plasticity lies the stress update algorithm, which integrates the constitutive law over a discrete strain increment.

The principal trial stresses are ordered as $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge \\sigma_3$:\n$$ \\sigma_1^{\\text{trial}} = 0.528 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\quad (\\text{from } \\sigma_{xx}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_2^{\\text{trial}} = 0.144 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\quad (\\text{from } \\sigma_{zz}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_3^{\\text{trial}} = 0.048 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\quad (\\text{from } \\sigma_{yy}) $$\n\nStep 2: Yield Check\nWe evaluate the yield function $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}})$:\n$$ f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}}) = \\sigma_1^{\\text{trial}}(1-\\sin\\phi) - \\sigma_3^{\\text{trial}}(1+\\sin\\phi) - 2c\\cos\\phi $$\n$$ f = 0.528(1-0.5) - 0.048(1+0.5) - 2(0.05)\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\n$$ f = 0.528(0.5) - 0.048(1.5) - 0.05\\sqrt{3} = 0.264 - 0.072 - 0.05\\sqrt{3} = 0.192 - 0.05\\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.1054 $$\nSince $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}})  0$, the material yields, and a plastic correction is required.\n\nStep 3: Plastic Correction\nThe total strain increment is decomposed as $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$. The final stress is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{final}} = \\mathbf{D} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e = \\mathbf{D} : (\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}} - \\mathbf{D} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$.\nThe plastic strain increment is given by the non-associated flow rule: $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, where $\\Delta\\lambda  0$ is the plastic multiplier.\nThe gradient of the plastic potential, $\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, in the principal stress space is:\n$$ \\mathbf{r} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial g / \\partial\\sigma_1 \\\\ \\partial g / \\partial\\sigma_2 \\\\ \\partial g / \\partial\\sigma_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\sin\\psi \\\\ 0 \\\\ -(1+\\sin\\psi) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-0.25 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -(1+0.25) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1.25 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe consistency condition requires that the final stress state lies on the yield surface, $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{final}}) = 0$. For this linear yield function, we can solve for $\\Delta\\lambda$ exactly:\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}})}{H} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad H = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\right)^T : \\mathbf{D} : \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\right) $$\nLet $\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$. In principal stress space, $\\mathbf{a} = \\left( 1-\\sin\\phi, 0, -(1+\\sin\\phi) \\right)^T = (0.5, 0, -1.5)^T$.\nThe modulus $H$ is computed for plane strain conditions:\n$$ H = a_1 (D_{11} r_1 + D_{13} r_3) + a_3 (D_{31} r_1 + D_{33} r_3) $$\n$$ H = a_1 ((\\lambda+2\\mu) r_1 + \\lambda r_3) + a_3 (\\lambda r_1 + (\\lambda+2\\mu) r_3) $$\n$$ H = (1-\\sin\\phi)[(\\lambda+2\\mu)(1-\\sin\\psi) - \\lambda(1+\\sin\\psi)] - (1+\\sin\\phi)[\\lambda(1-\\sin\\psi) - (\\lambda+2\\mu)(1+\\sin\\psi)] $$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ H = 0.5[144(0.75) - 48(1.25)] - 1.5[48(0.75) - 144(1.25)] $$\n$$ H = 0.5[108 - 60] - 1.5[36 - 180] = 0.5(48) - 1.5(-144) = 24 + 216 = 240 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nNow we find $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{0.192 - 0.05\\sqrt{3}}{240} \\approx 0.000439156 $$\nThe plastic strain increments are:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{xx}^p = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\sigma_{xx}} = \\Delta\\lambda r_1 = 0.75 \\Delta\\lambda \\approx 0.75 \\times 0.000439156 = 0.000329367 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{yy}^p = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial\\sigma_{yy}} = \\Delta\\lambda r_3 = -1.25 \\Delta\\lambda \\approx -1.25 \\times 0.000439156 = -0.000548945 $$\nSince $\\partial g / \\partial\\sigma_{xy} = 0$ (due to the problem assumptions and form of $g$), $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{xy}^p=0$, which implies $\\Delta\\gamma_{xy}^p=0$.\n\nThe final stress components are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{final}} = \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{trial}} - [(\\lambda+2\\mu)\\Delta\\varepsilon_{xx}^p + \\lambda\\Delta\\varepsilon_{yy}^p] = 0.528 - [144(0.75\\Delta\\lambda) + 48(-1.25\\Delta\\lambda)] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{final}} = 0.528 - [108 - 60]\\Delta\\lambda = 0.528 - 48\\Delta\\lambda $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{final}} = 0.528 - 48 \\left(\\frac{0.192 - 0.05\\sqrt{3}}{240}\\right) = 0.528 - 0.2(0.192 - 0.05\\sqrt{3}) = 0.4896 + 0.01\\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.506921 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}^{\\text{final}} = \\sigma_{yy}^{\\text{trial}} - [\\lambda\\Delta\\varepsilon_{xx}^p + (\\lambda+2\\mu)\\Delta\\varepsilon_{yy}^p] = 0.048 - [48(0.75\\Delta\\lambda) + 144(-1.25\\Delta\\lambda)] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}^{\\text{final}} = 0.048 - [36 - 180]\\Delta\\lambda = 0.048 + 144\\Delta\\lambda $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}^{\\text{final}} = 0.048 + 144 \\left(\\frac{0.192 - 0.05\\sqrt{3}}{240}\\right) = 0.048 + 0.6(0.192 - 0.05\\sqrt{3}) = 0.1632 - 0.03\\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.111238 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}^{\\text{final}} = \\sigma_{xy}^{\\text{trial}} - 2\\mu\\Delta\\varepsilon_{xy}^p = 0 - 0 = 0 \\,\\mathrm{MPa}$$\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures:\n- $\\sigma_{xx} = 0.5069 \\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n- $\\sigma_{yy} = 0.1112 \\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n- $\\sigma_{xy} = 0.0000 \\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n- $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{xx}^p = 0.0003294$\n- $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{yy}^p = -0.0005489$\n- $\\Delta\\gamma_{xy}^p = 0.0000$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5069  0.1112  0.0000  0.0003294  -0.0005489  0.0000 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3549281"}]}
