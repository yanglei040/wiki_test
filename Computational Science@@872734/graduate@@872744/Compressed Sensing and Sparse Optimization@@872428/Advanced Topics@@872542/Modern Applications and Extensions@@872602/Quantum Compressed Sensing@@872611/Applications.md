## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical foundations of quantum compressed sensing, focusing on the principles of [low-rank matrix recovery](@entry_id:198770) and the power of [convex optimization](@entry_id:137441), particularly [nuclear norm minimization](@entry_id:634994). Having developed this core machinery, we now turn our attention to its application. This chapter aims to demonstrate the remarkable utility and versatility of these principles by exploring their use in a wide range of contexts, from foundational problems in [quantum information science](@entry_id:150091) to interdisciplinary frontiers in physics and chemistry, and finally to the practical challenges of experimental implementation. Our goal is not to re-derive the core theory, but to illustrate how it is leveraged to solve meaningful scientific and engineering problems, thereby bridging abstract mathematical concepts with tangible applications.

### Core Applications in Quantum Information Science

The most immediate and impactful applications of quantum compressed sensing lie within [quantum information science](@entry_id:150091) itself, where the tasks of characterizing and verifying quantum states and processes are of paramount importance.

#### Quantum State and Process Tomography

The complete characterization of an unknown quantum state, a procedure known as [quantum state tomography](@entry_id:141156), is a fundamental primitive in any quantum technology. For a system of dimension $d$, a general density matrix $\rho$ is specified by $d^2 - 1$ real parameters. Traditional tomography methods require a number of measurement settings that scales with $d^2$, which becomes prohibitively expensive even for moderately sized systems (e.g., a few tens of qubits, where $d=2^n$). However, many physical states of interest—such as the ground states of local Hamiltonians or states produced in noisy experiments—are not arbitrary but possess structure. Specifically, they can often be well-approximated by a low-rank [density matrix](@entry_id:139892). This is precisely the structure that quantum [compressed sensing](@entry_id:150278) is designed to exploit.

The simplest non-trivial case, which bridges classical signal processing and quantum tomography, is the [phase retrieval](@entry_id:753392) problem. Here, the goal is to reconstruct a pure quantum state, described by a vector $|\psi\rangle \in \mathbb{C}^d$, from magnitude-only measurements of the form $|\langle u_i | \psi \rangle|^2$. These quadratic measurements can be "lifted" to a linear problem by considering the rank-1 [density matrix](@entry_id:139892) $X = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$. The measurements then take the form of linear trace inner products, $\operatorname{Tr}(A_i X)$, where $A_i = |u_i\rangle\langle u_i|$. To recover the rank-1 matrix $X$, one can solve a convex program that minimizes the [nuclear norm](@entry_id:195543) $\|X\|_*$ (which simplifies to $\operatorname{Tr}(X)$ for [positive semidefinite matrices](@entry_id:202354)) subject to the measurement constraints and the physicality constraint $X \succeq 0$ [@problem_id:3471769]. This technique, known as PhaseLift, provides a powerful convex-analytic framework for a classically non-convex problem. The number of generic measurements, such as those drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution, required for guaranteed recovery (up to an unobservable [global phase](@entry_id:147947)) is on the order of $m \approx 4d-4$ [@problem_id:3471744]. In practice, for structured measurements like random subsets of a Fourier basis, one must employ techniques like Coded Diffraction Patterns—using multiple random masks—to break symmetries and ensure injectivity [@problem_id:3471744].

This paradigm extends directly to the general case of mixed-state tomography. If the unknown state $\rho$ is assumed to have rank $r \ll d$, it can be recovered from a much smaller number of measurements than traditional methods would suggest. By performing measurements with a set of well-chosen operators $\{M_i\}$ and obtaining outcomes $y_i = \operatorname{Tr}(M_i \rho)$, one can solve the [nuclear norm minimization](@entry_id:634994) problem:
$$ \min_{X} \|X\|_* \quad \text{subject to} \quad \operatorname{Tr}(M_i X) = y_i, \quad X \succeq 0, \quad \operatorname{Tr}(X)=1. $$
For random measurement schemes, such as measurements of random Pauli [observables](@entry_id:267133), the number of settings required for stable recovery scales nearly linearly with the system size, typically as $m \gtrsim C r d \log(d)$, a dramatic improvement over the $O(d^2)$ scaling of standard [tomography](@entry_id:756051) [@problem_id:3471726].

The choice of measurement operators $\{M_i\}$ is critical. While ensembles of random Gaussian matrices provide strong theoretical guarantees, they are often impractical to implement experimentally. A more feasible and widely used approach is to measure randomized Pauli observables. These measurements, formed by tensor products of single-qubit Pauli operators, are experimentally accessible on many quantum platforms. Although they are not fully rotationally invariant like Gaussian matrices, they possess favorable coherence properties and yield uniformly bounded outcomes, making them robust and practical for compressed sensing [@problem_id:3471756]. For certain highly structured measurement designs, such as Symmetric Informationally Complete POVMs (SIC-POVMs), the sensing operators form an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF), which achieves the Welch bound on [mutual coherence](@entry_id:188177) and is optimally incoherent, making it an excellent candidate for [compressed sensing](@entry_id:150278) applications [@problem_id:3434911].

The principles of compressed state tomography can be extended to quantum process tomography—the characterization of an unknown [quantum channel](@entry_id:141237) $\mathcal{E}$. Through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, any linear map $\mathcal{E}$ can be uniquely associated with a matrix $J(\mathcal{E})$ in a higher-dimensional space. A channel has a low Kraus rank if and only if its Choi matrix is low-rank. This allows us to re-cast process [tomography](@entry_id:756051) as another instance of [low-rank matrix recovery](@entry_id:198770). The physical constraints on the channel, such as being completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP), translate into elegant constraints on the Choi matrix: complete positivity corresponds to $J(\mathcal{E}) \succeq 0$, and the trace-preserving property corresponds to a [partial trace](@entry_id:146482) constraint, $\operatorname{Tr}_{\text{out}} J(\mathcal{E}) = I_{\text{in}}$. By preparing a set of input states and measuring the outputs, one obtains [linear constraints](@entry_id:636966) on $J(\mathcal{E})$, enabling its recovery via a convex program that minimizes the [nuclear norm](@entry_id:195543) subject to these physical and measurement constraints [@problem_id:3471794]. A powerful experimental technique for this is ancilla-assisted process [tomography](@entry_id:756051), where the channel acts on one part of a maximally [entangled state](@entry_id:142916). Measurements on the joint system then provide direct linear probes of the Choi matrix, simplifying the measurement model [@problem_id:3471727].

#### Efficient Property Estimation with Classical Shadows

Often, full tomographic knowledge of a state is unnecessary. An experimenter may only be interested in estimating the [expectation values](@entry_id:153208) of a small number of specific observables. The protocol of [classical shadows](@entry_id:144622) provides a remarkably efficient method for this task, leveraging randomized measurements in a manner deeply connected to [compressed sensing](@entry_id:150278). The procedure involves repeatedly applying a random unitary from a specific group (e.g., the Clifford group), measuring in a fixed basis (e.g., the computational basis), and classically post-processing the outcome to construct a "snapshot" of the state. While a single snapshot is a very noisy estimate, averaging a small number of them yields a classical description—the "shadow"—of the quantum state. This shadow can then be used to estimate the [expectation values](@entry_id:153208) of many different [observables](@entry_id:267133), with a variance controlled by a quantity known as the shadow norm of the observable. For many physically relevant [observables](@entry_id:267133) (e.g., local [observables](@entry_id:267133)), the number of measurements required is independent of the system size, offering an exponential advantage over full tomography [@problem_id:3471791].

#### Entanglement Verification

Beyond characterizing states and processes, [compressed sensing](@entry_id:150278) provides tools for certifying specific quantum properties. A key example is entanglement verification. The Schmidt rank of a pure bipartite state, or more generally the Schmidt number of a [mixed state](@entry_id:147011), is a crucial indicator of its entanglement complexity. Certifying that an unknown state $\rho$ has a Schmidt number no greater than a certain value $r$ is a non-trivial task. This problem can be elegantly framed in the language of atomic norms. One defines an "atomic set" of all states with Schmidt number at most $r$ and constructs the corresponding [atomic norm](@entry_id:746563). Verifying the property then amounts to showing that the state's [atomic norm](@entry_id:746563) is equal to one. Convex duality provides a path to certification: if one can construct a "dual witness" operator from a small number of random local measurement outcomes, this witness can certify that the state is the unique solution to an atomic-norm minimization problem, thereby verifying its entanglement structure. The number of local measurements required scales with the complexity of the entangled state, typically as $m \gtrsim r(d_A + d_B)$, rather than the full dimension $d_A d_B$ [@problem_id:3471724].

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers

The applicability of quantum [compressed sensing](@entry_id:150278) extends well beyond its native domain of quantum information, providing powerful new tools for other scientific disciplines that contend with complex quantum systems.

#### Continuous-Variable Systems in Quantum Optics

While much of quantum information focuses on finite-dimensional qubit systems, many physical platforms, such as modes of the electromagnetic field, are described by continuous-variable (CV) systems. The principles of compressed sensing are equally potent here. A fundamental task in quantum optics is to characterize the state of a light mode, often by reconstructing its covariance matrix for Gaussian states. The covariance matrix, which contains the second moments of the position and momentum quadrature operators, is constrained by the Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty relation. This physicality constraint, which for a single mode is equivalent to $\det(V) \ge 1/4$, defines a [convex set](@entry_id:268368) of valid covariance matrices. By performing a small number of homodyne measurements of random quadratures, one can recover a low-rank covariance matrix by minimizing its nuclear norm subject to the measurement and uncertainty-principle constraints, demonstrating the framework's adaptability to the distinct mathematical structures of CV quantum mechanics [@problem_id:3471759].

#### Reaction Dynamics in Theoretical Chemistry

In theoretical and computational chemistry, a central goal is to calculate the rate of chemical reactions. For reactions involving quantum effects like tunneling, this rate can be determined from the time integral of the [flux-flux correlation function](@entry_id:191742), $C_{FF}(t)$. A direct, brute-force calculation of $C_{FF}(t)$ requires simulating the [quantum dynamics](@entry_id:138183) for many points in time, a task that is often computationally prohibitive. However, $C_{FF}(t)$ is often a highly structured signal, representable as a sum of a small number of [damped oscillations](@entry_id:167749). This means it is sparse or compressible in an appropriate basis. This observation opens the door to applying compressed sensing: one can reconstruct the [entire function](@entry_id:178769) $C_{FF}(t)$ from simulations at only a small, random subset of time points. The success of this approach hinges on the standard principles of compressed sensing, namely the choice of a sparsifying dictionary that matches the signal structure and a sampling scheme (e.g., random or jittered sampling) that is incoherent with that dictionary. This application represents a profound connection, where a signal processing technique inspired by [quantum measurement](@entry_id:138328) theory is looped back to solve a fundamental problem in [quantum dynamics](@entry_id:138183) itself [@problem_id:2800458].

### Practical Considerations and Advanced Topics

Bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and experimental reality requires addressing practical challenges such as noise, implementation constraints, and calibration errors.

#### Mitigating Experimental Imperfections

Real-world quantum experiments are inevitably affected by imperfections. A major class of such issues is State Preparation and Measurement (SPAM) errors, which can introduce systematic, constant biases in measurement outcomes. A naive application of compressed sensing algorithms to such biased data would lead to incorrect reconstructions. Fortunately, these errors can often be characterized and corrected. By performing a set of calibration measurements on a well-known [reference state](@entry_id:151465), one can estimate the SPAM bias for each measurement setting. This bias estimate can then be subtracted from the raw data of the unknown state, yielding a debiased estimator. This procedure effectively cancels the systematic error, and its primary cost is an increase in the total statistical variance, which depends on the number of shots used for both the main experiment and the calibration [@problem_id:3471793].

#### Optimizing Measurement Implementations

Implementing the "random" measurements required by [compressed sensing](@entry_id:150278) theory on a physical quantum computer presents its own set of challenges. Generating a truly random measurement basis can require a quantum circuit of considerable depth. However, gate operations in current quantum devices are noisy, and the error in the final measurement accumulates with the depth of the circuit used to implement it. This introduces a fundamental tradeoff: deeper circuits can produce measurement designs that are more incoherent (and thus better for compressed sensing), but they also introduce more noise, which degrades the reconstruction. This tradeoff can be modeled mathematically, for example, by describing the improvement in measurement quality as an exponential decay with [circuit depth](@entry_id:266132) and the increase in noise variance as a linear function of depth. By analyzing this model, one can determine an optimal [circuit depth](@entry_id:266132) that minimizes the total reconstruction error, balancing the competing demands of design quality and noise accumulation [@problem_id:3471728].

#### Blind and Self-Calibrating Tomography

A particularly challenging and advanced scenario is blind [tomography](@entry_id:756051), where not only the quantum state $\rho$ is unknown, but the measurement operators themselves are not perfectly known. This might occur if the apparatus used to implement the measurements is miscalibrated. If one has a structural model for both the state (e.g., low-rank) and the measurement errors (e.g., the unknown measurement unitary is close to an intended one and can be described by a sparse set of parameters), then it is possible to recover both simultaneously. This bilinear inverse problem is non-convex, but it can be effectively tackled using algorithms like [alternating minimization](@entry_id:198823), which iteratively solve for the state and the calibration parameters. The total number of measurements required must be sufficient to constrain both the state and the unknown measurement parameters, with [sample complexity](@entry_id:636538) typically summing the requirements for each individual sub-problem [@problem_id:3471770].

### Conclusion

As this chapter has illustrated, the principles of quantum compressed sensing provide a unifying and powerful framework for a vast array of problems in quantum science and beyond. From the foundational task of characterizing quantum states and processes with unprecedented efficiency, to certifying esoteric properties like entanglement, to enabling new computational approaches in chemistry and quantum optics, the paradigm of leveraging structure and sparsity has proven indispensable. By thoughtfully considering the interplay between theoretical guarantees, practical implementation constraints, and experimental noise, quantum [compressed sensing](@entry_id:150278) is not merely an abstract theory but a practical toolkit that is actively shaping the landscape of modern quantum research.
