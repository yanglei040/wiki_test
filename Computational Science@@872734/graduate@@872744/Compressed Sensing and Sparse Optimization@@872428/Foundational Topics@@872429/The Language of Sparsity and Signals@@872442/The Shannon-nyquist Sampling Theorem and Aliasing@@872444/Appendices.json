It also requests an analysis of the cases of undersampling and oversampling.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principle governing this problem. The sampling operator $S_{\\{t_k\\}}: PW_{\\Omega_B} \\to \\ell^{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a bounded invertible bijection if and only if the set of sampling functions, when viewed in the Fourier domain, forms a Riesz basis for the space of Fourier transforms.

To analyze the stability of the system $\\{e^{\\mathrm{i} \\omega t_k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ on the interval $[-\\Omega_B, \\Omega_B]$, it is standard to re-normalize the problem to the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. Let us define a new frequency variable $\\omega' = T\\omega = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega_B}\\omega$. As $\\omega$ varies over $[-\\Omega_B, \\Omega_B]$, $\\omega'$ varies over $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. The sampling instances are $t_k = kT + \\epsilon_k$. We can write the exponents as:\n$$\n\\omega t_k = \\left(\\frac{\\omega'}{T}\\right) (kT + \\epsilon_k) = \\omega' \\left(k + \\frac{\\epsilon_k}{T}\\right).\n$$\nLet us define the dimensionless sequence $\\lambda_k = k + \\frac{\\epsilon_k}{T}$. The problem is now equivalent to determining the conditions under which the set of exponentials $\\{e^{\\mathrm{i} \\omega' \\lambda_k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ forms a Riesz basis for $L^2[-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n\nThe condition on the perturbations is given as $|\\epsilon_k|  \\alpha T$, for some $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. In terms of the normalized sequence $\\lambda_k$, this is:\n$$\n|\\lambda_k - k| = \\left|\\frac{\\epsilon_k}{T}\\right|  \\alpha.\n$$\nThe stability of non-harmonic Fourier series of this form is addressed by Kadec's 1/4 theorem. The theorem states that if a sequence of real numbers $\\{\\lambda_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ satisfies $\\sup_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\lambda_k - k| = L$, then the set of functions $\\{e^{\\mathrm{i} \\omega' \\lambda_k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ forms a Riesz basis for $L^2[-\\pi, \\pi]$ if $L  1/4$. The constant $1/4$ is sharp, meaning that if $L = 1/4$, there exist sequences $\\{\\lambda_k\\}$ for which the set is not a Riesz basis (it might lose completeness or linear independence).\n\nWe are seeking the largest bound $\\alpha$ which *guarantees* that $S_{\\{t_k\\}}$ is an invertible bijection for *any* perturbation sequence $\\{\\epsilon_k\\}$ satisfying $|\\epsilon_k|  \\alpha T$.\nThe condition given is $|\\epsilon_k/T|  \\alpha$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $L = \\sup_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\epsilon_k/T|$. The condition implies $L \\le \\alpha$. For the Riesz basis property to be guaranteed, we must have $L  1/4$.\n\nIf we choose any $\\alpha  1/4$, then $|\\epsilon_k/T|  \\alpha$ implies $L \\le \\alpha  1/4$. In this case, Kadec's theorem guarantees that the set is a Riesz basis.\nConsider the boundary case $\\alpha = 1/4$. The condition on the perturbations becomes $|\\epsilon_k/T|  1/4$. This implies $L = \\sup_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\epsilon_k/T| \\le 1/4$. However, this does not forbid the possibility that $L=1/4$. For example, the sequence $\\epsilon_k = \\frac{T}{4}(1 - \\frac{1}{|k|+1}) \\text{ for } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies $|\\epsilon_k|  T/4$ for all $k$, but $\\sup_k |\\epsilon_k/T| = 1/4$. Because there exist perturbation sequences with supremum $L=1/4$ that fail to generate a Riesz basis, setting the bound $\\alpha=1/4$ does not provide an absolute guarantee of invertibility for all admissible sequences.\n\nThe question asks for the \"largest bound on $\\alpha$\". This is standard terminology for the supremum of the set of parameters for which a desired property holds. The property (guaranteed invertibility) holds for any $\\alpha \\in (0, 1/4)$. The supremum of this set is $1/4$. For any specific jittered sequence where $\\sup_k |\\epsilon_k/T|  1/4$, stability is assured. The bound $\\alpha$ itself can be set at the critical value, delineating the boundary of the stability region. Thus, the largest value for the bound is $\\alpha = 1/4$.\n\nNext, we address the other conditions on the sampling period $T$.\n\nCase 1: $T > \\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega_B}$. This is the undersampling case. The average sampling rate $1/T$ is less than the Nyquist rate $2f_B = \\Omega_B/\\pi$. The Beurling density of the sampling set $\\{t_k\\}$ is $1/T$. For the set of exponentials $\\{e^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega t_k}\\}$ to be complete in $L^2[-\\Omega_B, \\Omega_B]$, the density must be at least the measure of the frequency support interval divided by $2\\pi$, which is $2\\Omega_B / (2\\pi) = \\Omega_B/\\pi$. Since $T > \\pi/\\Omega_B$, we have $1/T  \\Omega_B/\\pi$. The sampling density is too low. The set of exponentials is not complete in $L^2[-\\Omega_B, \\Omega_B]$. This implies that the sampling operator $S_{\\{t_k\\}}$ has a non-trivial null space. There exist non-zero functions in $PW_{\\Omega_B}$ whose samples $f(t_k)$ are all zero. The operator is not injective and therefore cannot be inverted. This is the mathematical basis for aliasing. The presence of jitter $\\epsilon_k$ does not remedy this fundamental density deficit.\n\nCase 2: $T  \\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega_B}$. This is the oversampling case. The sampling rate $1/T$ is greater than the Nyquist rate $\\Omega_B/\\pi$. The density of the sampling set is higher than necessary. In this scenario, the set of exponentials $\\{e^{\\mathrm{i} \\omega t_k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ is overcomplete in $L^2[-\\Omega_B, \\Omega_B]$. Such a system is known as a frame, but it is not a Riesz basis because its elements are not linearly independent (in the topological sense). While a frame structure ensures that reconstruction is stable (the sampling operator is bounded below on its domain and thus has a stable pseudo-inverse), the operator $S_{\\{t_k\\}}$ is not surjective (onto $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$). The range of $S_{\\{t_k\\}}$ is a proper subspace of $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$; not every sequence in $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a valid set of samples of a function in $PW_{\\Omega_B}$. Since the operator is not surjective, it cannot be a bijection from $PW_{\\Omega_B}$ onto $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nIn summary, only at the critical Nyquist rate $T=\\pi/\\Omega_B$ can the sampling operator potentially be a bijection. This requires the set of sampling points $\\{t_k\\}$ to satisfy the strict constraints of Kadec's theorem, leading to the bound on the jitter parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nThe largest bound on $\\alpha$ is the supremum of the interval $(0, 1/4)$, which is $1/4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "3490188"}, {"introduction": "In the realm of compressed sensing, we deliberately sample below the Nyquist rate, viewing aliasing not as a problem to be avoided but as a structured phenomenon to be inverted.

Specifically, $R_x[\\tau] = |\\Lambda \\cap (\\Lambda - \\tau)|$, where $\\Lambda - \\tau = \\{j-\\tau \\pmod n \\mid j \\in \\Lambda\\}$.\nAt lag $\\tau=0$, we have $R_x[0] = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x[j]^2 = \\sum_{j \\in \\Lambda} 1^2 = k$.\n\nThe Wiener-Khinchin theorem for discrete periodic signals states that the DFT of the autocorrelation sequence is the power spectrum of the signal, i.e., $\\text{DFT}\\{R_x\\}[m] = |X[m]|^2$. We derive this from first principles as requested.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{DFT}\\{R_x\\}[m] = \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{n-1} R_x[\\tau] \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m \\tau}{n}\\right) \\\\\n= \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{n-1} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x[j] \\, x[j+\\tau] \\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m \\tau}{n}\\right) \\\\\n= \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x[j] \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{n-1} x[j+\\tau] \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m \\tau}{n}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nLet $l = j+\\tau \\pmod n$, so $\\tau = l-j \\pmod n$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{DFT}\\{R_x\\}[m] = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x[j] \\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} x[l] \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m (l-j)}{n}\\right) \\\\\n= \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x[j] \\exp\\!\\left(\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m j}{n}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} x[l] \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m l}{n}\\right) \\right) \\\\\n= \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x[j] \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi (-m) j}{n}\\right) \\right) (X[m]) \\\\\n= X[-m] \\cdot X[m]\n\\end{align*}\nSince the sequence $x[j]$ is real-valued, its DFT has Hermitian symmetry, $X[-m] = (X[m])^*$, where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. Therefore,\n$$\n|X[m]|^2 = (X[m])^* X[m] = X[-m] X[m] = \\text{DFT}\\{R_x\\}[m]\n$$\nThis confirms the relationship. To minimize the peak value $\\max_{m \\neq 0} |X[m]|$, one should choose $x[j]$ such that its spectral power $|X[m]|^2$ is as flat as possible for $m \\neq 0$. This, in turn, suggests a specific structure for the autocorrelation sequence $R_x[\\tau]$.\nThe ideal structure for $R_x[\\tau]$ to produce a flat spectrum $|X[m]|^2$ for $m \\neq 0$ is a two-level structure:\n$$\nR_x[\\tau] = \\begin{cases} k  \\text{if } \\tau = 0 \\pmod n \\\\ \\lambda  \\text{if } \\tau \\neq 0 \\pmod n \\end{cases}\n$$\nfor some constant $\\lambda$. A set $\\Lambda$ whose indicator sequence has this property is known as a cyclic $(n, k, \\lambda)$-difference set. For such a set, the power spectrum for $m \\neq 0$ is:\n\\begin{align*}\n|X[m]|^2 = \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{n-1} R_x[\\tau] \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m \\tau}{n}\\right) \\\\\n= R_x[0] + \\sum_{\\tau=1}^{n-1} R_x[\\tau] \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m \\tau}{n}\\right) \\\\\n= k + \\lambda \\sum_{\\tau=1}^{n-1} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\mathrm{i} \\frac{2\\pi m \\tau}{n}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the identity $\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{n-1} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} 2\\pi m \\tau / n) = 0$ for $m \\neq 0$, we have $\\sum_{\\tau=1}^{n-1} \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} 2\\pi m \\tau / n) = -1$.\nThus, for all $m \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, the power spectrum is constant:\n$$\n|X[m]|^2 = k - \\lambda\n$$\nThis leads to a constant magnitude for the off-center DFT coefficients: $|X[m]| = \\sqrt{k-\\lambda}$.\nThe theoretical criterion for choosing $\\Lambda$ to minimize aliasing is to select it as a cyclic difference set. For such a choice, the mutual coherence is constant for all pairs $(f,g)$ with $f \\neq g$, and takes the value:\n$$\n\\mu(\\Lambda) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sqrt{k - \\lambda}\n$$\n\nNow, we specialize this criterion to the case given in the problem. We are told to assume that when $p$ is a prime satisfying $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, the set $\\Lambda$ of quadratic residues modulo $p$ forms a cyclic difference set in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Let $n=p$.\nThe parameters of this specific difference set (a Paley difference set) are:\n- $p$: the size of the ground set, so $n=p$.\n- $k$: the size of the set $\\Lambda$. The number of non-zero quadratic residues modulo a prime $p$ is $k = (p-1)/2$.\n- $\\lambda$: the number of ways any non-zero element can be written as a difference of two elements in $\\Lambda$. For this construction, $\\lambda = (k-1)/2 = \\frac{(p-1)/2 - 1}{2} = \\frac{p-3}{4}$. The condition $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ ensures that $p-3$ is a multiple of $4$, so $\\lambda$ is an integer.\n\nFor this choice of $\\Lambda$, we can calculate the value of $k-\\lambda$:\n$$\nk - \\lambda = \\frac{p-1}{2} - \\frac{p-3}{4} = \\frac{2(p-1) - (p-3)}{4} = \\frac{2p-2-p+3}{4} = \\frac{p+1}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\mu(\\Lambda)$:\n$$\n\\mu(\\Lambda) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sqrt{k - \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{(p-1)/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{p+1}{4}} = \\frac{2}{p-1} \\frac{\\sqrt{p+1}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p+1}}{p-1}\n$$\nThis is the worst-case mutual coherence for a mask constructed from quadratic residues modulo a prime $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n\nFinally, we apply this result to the specific case $n=p=43$.\nFirst, we verify that the condition on $p$ is met: $43 = 4 \\times 10 + 3$, so $43 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nThe theory applies directly. The sampling mask $\\Lambda$ is the set of quadratic residues modulo $43$.\nThe number of samples is $k = (43-1)/2 = 21$.\nThe autocorrelation parameter is $\\lambda = (43-3)/4 = 10$.\nThe problem asks for the exact value of the worst-case mutual coherence $\\mu(\\Lambda)$. Using our derived formula:\n$$\n\\mu(\\Lambda) = \\frac{\\sqrt{p+1}}{p-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{43+1}}{43-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{44}}{42}\n$$\nWe simplify this expression:\n$$\n\\mu(\\Lambda) = \\frac{\\sqrt{4 \\times 11}}{42} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{11}}{42} = \\frac{\\sqrt{11}}{21}\n$$\nThis is the exact value of the worst-case mutual coherence for the specified sampling mask.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{11}}{21}}$$", "id": "3490149"}]}
