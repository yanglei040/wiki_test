The entries of $G$ are $G_{ii} = \\|a_i\\|_2^2 = 1$ and $G_{ij} = \\langle a_i, a_j \\rangle = \\mu$ for $i \\neq j$. The matrix $G$ can be written as $G = (1-\\mu)I + \\mu J$, where $J$ is the matrix of all ones. The eigenvalues of this matrix are $1+(n-1)\\mu$ (with eigenvector $\\mathbf{1}$, the vector of all ones) and $1-\\mu$ (with multiplicity $n-1$). Since $\\mu \\in [0, 1)$, the largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max}(G) = 1 + (n-1)\\mu$. The spectral norm of $A$ is $\\|A\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\max}(G)}$, so for this specific construction, $\\|A\\|_2 = \\sqrt{1 + (n-1)\\mu}$.\n\n**Part 2: Upper Bound $U(n,\\mu)$ on the Spectral Norm**\nFor a general matrix $A$ with unit-norm columns and coherence $\\mu(A) \\le \\mu$, we again consider its Gram matrix $G = A^{\\top}A$. Its entries satisfy $G_{ii}=1$ and $|G_{ij}| \\le \\mu$ for $i \\neq j$. We can bound the eigenvalues of $G$ using the Gershgorin Circle Theorem. For any eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $G$, it must lie in a disk centered at $G_{ii}=1$ with radius $R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |G_{ij}| \\le (n-1)\\mu$. This means $|\\lambda - 1| \\le (n-1)\\mu$, which implies $\\lambda \\le 1 + (n-1)\\mu$. This holds for all eigenvalues, including the maximum one. Therefore, an upper bound on the spectral norm is $\\|A\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\max}(G)} \\le \\sqrt{1 + (n-1)\\mu}$. The result from Part 1 shows this bound is tight.

The matrix $G_S$ is a $k \\times k$ matrix with ones on the diagonal and off-diagonal entries with magnitude at most $\\mu$. Applying the Gershgorin Circle Theorem to $G_S$, any eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must satisfy $|\\lambda - 1| \\le \\sum_{j \\in S, j \\neq i} |(G_S)_{ij}| \\le (k-1)\\mu$ for some $i \\in S$. The widest interval occurs for the largest possible $k$, which is $s$. So, all eigenvalues of any such $G_S$ (for $|S| \\le s$) lie in $[1-(s-1)\\mu, 1+(s-1)\\mu]$. Comparing this with the RIP definition, we find that the RIP constant $\\delta_s$ for any such matrix must be bounded by $(s-1)\\mu$.
