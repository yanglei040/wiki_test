This first hands-on practice guides you through a standard verification procedure by comparing your numerical results against a known exact solution, allowing you to measure the code's convergence rate as a key indicator of its correctness [@problem_id:3126907]. This exercise forms the essential foundation for any further numerical investigation.", "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional heat conduction model based on conservation of energy and Fourier’s law of heat conduction, which leads to the parabolic partial differential equation (PDE)\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2},\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the temperature, $x \\in [0,1]$ is the spatial coordinate, $t \\in [0,T]$ is time, and $\\nu$ is the thermal diffusivity. Impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, $u(0,t) = 0$ and $u(1,t) = 0$, and choose initial conditions that are finite Fourier sine series on $[0,1]$. For such initial data, each sine mode evolves independently, and the exact solution remains a sine series with exponentially decaying coefficients. Specifically, for initial data\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} a_k \\sin(k\\pi x),\n$$\nthe exact solution is\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} a_k \\exp\\!\\big(-\\nu (k\\pi)^2 t\\big)\\,\\sin(k\\pi x).\n$$\n\nYour task is to implement a numerical benchmark using a uniform explicit finite difference method that advances in time with a forward difference and approximates the second spatial derivative with a centered difference. This approach is commonly referred to as Forward Time Centered Space (FTCS).

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer and numerical analysis, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of requirements for a standard convergence study of the Forward Time Centered Space (FTCS) method for the one-dimensional heat equation.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows:\nFirst, we discretize the governing partial differential equation (PDE), then implement the numerical scheme, and finally, execute the specified benchmark to compute the convergence rates.\n\n### 1. Discretization of the Heat Equation\n\nThe one-dimensional heat equation is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\non the domain $x \\in [0, 1]$ and $t \\in [0, T]$, with thermal diffusivity $\\nu$. We introduce a uniform spatial grid with $N_x$ intervals, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = 1/N_x$. The grid points are $x_j = j \\Delta x$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, N_x$. The time domain is discretized with a uniform time step $\\Delta t$, such that $t_n = n \\Delta t$. We denote the numerical approximation of the solution $u(x_j, t_n)$ as $u_j^n$.\n\nThe FTCS method approximates the time and space derivatives as follows:\n- The time derivative $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ is approximated using a first-order forward difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{(x_j, t_n)} \\approx \\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n- The second spatial derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ is approximated using a second-order centered difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{(x_j, t_n)} \\approx \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the heat equation yields the explicit update formula for the FTCS scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t} = \\nu \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nRearranging for $u_j^{n+1}$, we obtain the update rule for the temperature at the next time step:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n + \\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\left( u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n \\right)\n$$\nIntroducing the stability parameter $r = \\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n + r \\left( u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n \\right)\n$$\nThis formula is applied to all interior grid points, i.e., for $j = 1, 2, \\dots, N_x-1$.\n\n### 2. Implementation of Boundary Conditions and Initial State\n\nThe problem specifies homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, $u(0,t) = 0$ and $u(1,t) = 0$. In our discrete framework, this translates to fixing the values at the endpoints of the grid for all time steps:\n$$\nu_0^n = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u_{N_x}^n = 0 \\quad \\forall n \\ge 0\n$$\nThe initial condition is a finite Fourier sine series:\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} a_k \\sin(k\\pi x)\n$$\nThe numerical solution is initialized by evaluating this function at each grid point $x_j$ at time $t=0$:\n$$\nu_j^0 = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} a_k \\sin(k\\pi x_j)\n$$\n\n### 3. Time-Stepping Algorithm\n\nThe numerical solution is advanced from $t=0$ to the final time $t=T$. The time step $\\Delta t$ is determined by the given stability parameter $r$ and the spatial resolution $N_x$: $\\Delta t = r (\\Delta x)^2 / \\nu$.\n\nSince $T$ may not be an integer multiple of $\\Delta t$, the process consists of two stages:\n1.  Calculate the number of full time steps, $N_{\\text{steps}} = \\lfloor T/\\Delta t \\rfloor$. The simulation is run for $N_{\\text{steps}}$ iterations using the standard FTCS update rule.\n2.  Calculate the remaining time, $\\Delta t_{\\text{last}} = T - N_{\\text{steps}} \\Delta t$. If $\\Delta t_{\\text{last}} > 0$, a final, shorter time step is taken. The update rule for this last step uses a modified stability parameter, $r_{\\text{last}} = \\frac{\\nu \\Delta t_{\\text{last}}}{(\\Delta x)^2}$.\n\n### 4. Error Analysis and Convergence Rate\n\nAfter evolving the numerical solution $u_j^{N_{\\text{final}}}$ to $t=T$, we compute the error by comparing it to the exact analytical solution evaluated at the same grid points and final time:\n$$\nu_{\\text{exact}}(x_j, T) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} a_k \\exp(-\\nu (k\\pi)^2 T) \\sin(k\\pi x_j)\n$$\nThe pointwise error is $e_j = u_j^{N_{\\text{final}}} - u_{\\text{exact}}(x_j, T)$. The error is quantified using two discrete norms:\n- **Discrete $L^2$ norm:** $\\|e\\|_{L^2} = \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{N_x} |e_j|^2 \\Delta x\\right)^{1/2}$\n- **Discrete $L^\\infty$ norm:** $\\|e\\|_{L^\\infty} = \\max_{0 \\le j \\le N_x} |e_j|$\n\nFor each test case, we compute these errors for a sequence of spatial resolutions $N_x$. The FTCS scheme has a truncation error of $O(\\Delta t + (\\Delta x)^2)$. Since we fix $r$, we have $\\Delta t \\propto (\\Delta x)^2$, making the method second-order accurate in space, i.e., the global error is expected to behave as $O((\\Delta x)^2)$.\n\nThe observed order of convergence, $p$, is computed using the errors from the two finest resolutions (with grid spacings $\\Delta x_{\\text{coarse}}$ and $\\Delta x_{\\text{fine}}$, where $\\Delta x_{\\text{coarse}} = 2 \\Delta x_{\\text{fine}}$):\n$$\np = \\frac{\\log(\\text{error}_{\\text{coarse}} / \\text{error}_{\\text{fine}})}{\\log(\\Delta x_{\\text{coarse}} / \\Delta x_{\\text{fine}})} = \\frac{\\log(\\text{error}_{\\text{coarse}} / \\text{error}_{\\text{fine}})}{\\log(2)}\n$$\nThis is calculated for both the $L^2$ and $L^\\infty$ norms. The expected value for $p$ is approximately $2$.\n\nThe final program implements this entire procedure for the three specified test cases, collecting the six convergence rates for the final output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_simulation(nu, T, r, initial_cond_coeffs, Nx):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a single simulation of the 1D heat equation using the FTCS method.\n\n    Args:\n        nu (float): Thermal diffusivity.\n        T (float): Final time.\n        r (float): Stability parameter r = nu * dt / dx^2.\n        initial_cond_coeffs (dict): Dictionary of {k: a_k} for the initial sine series.\n        Nx (int): Number of spatial intervals.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the discrete L2 error and L-infinity error.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

The parameter $\\mu = \\alpha \\Delta t / \\Delta x^2$ is a product of non-negative quantities ($\\alpha>0, \\Delta t>0$), so $\\mu \\ge 0$ is always satisfied.\n2.  The coefficient $(1 - 2\\mu)$ must be non-negative:\n    $$\n    1 - 2\\mu \\ge 0 \\implies 1 \\ge 2\\mu \\implies \\mu \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n    $$\nThis condition, $\\mu \\le 1/2$, is the stability condition for the FTCS scheme for the heat equation. It ensures that the solution does not grow unboundedly and, in this context, preserves non-negativity.\n\nSubstituting the definition of $\\mu$ back into the inequality, we get the condition on the time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nThe problem defines the critical time step, $\\Delta t_\\star$, as the largest time step that still preserves this principle. This corresponds to the equality in the condition:\n$$\n\\Delta t_\\star = \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta x = L/(N+1)$.\n\n### Step 2: Design of the Numerical Experiment\n\nThe experiment validates the derived condition by testing three scenarios for the time step $\\Delta t$ relative to $\\Delta t_\\star$:\n-   $\\Delta t_{\\text{bad}} = 1.1 \\, \\Delta t_\\star$: This corresponds to $\\mu = 1.1 \\times 0.5 = 0.55$, which violates the condition $\\mu \\le 0.5$.\n-   $\\Delta t_{\\text{border}} = 1.0 \\, \\Delta t_\\star$: This corresponds to $\\mu = 0.5$, which is on the boundary of the stable region.\n-   $\\Delta t_{\\text{good}} = 0.9 \\, \\Delta t_\\star$: This corresponds to $\\mu = 0.9 \\times 0.5 = 0.45$, which is safely within the stable region.\n\nFor each parameter set $(\\alpha, L, N, K)$:\n1.  Calculate the spatial step size $\\Delta x = L / (N+1)$.\n2.  Calculate the critical time step $\\Delta t_\\star = \\Delta x^2 / (2\\alpha)$.\n3.  For each of the three time steps ($\\Delta t_{\\text{bad}}$, $\\Delta t_{\\text{border}}$, $\\Delta t_{\\text{good}}$), perform a simulation:\n    a. Initialize a one-dimensional array `u` of size $N+2$ to represent the temperature at grid points $i=0, \\dots, N+1$.\n    b. Set the initial condition: `u` is zero everywhere except at the interior index $i^\\star = \\lfloor (N+1)/2 \\rfloor$, where $u_{i^\\star} = 1$. The boundary points $u_0$ and $u_{N+1}$ are always zero.\n    c. Initialize a boolean flag `negativity_observed = False`.\n    d. Evolve the system for $K$ time steps. In each step $n=0, \\dots, K-1$:\n        i.  Compute the next state $u^{n+1}$ from the current state $u^n$ using the update rule $u_i^{n+1} = \\mu u_{i-1}^n + (1 - 2\\mu) u_i^n + \\mu u_{i+1}^n$ for all interior points $i=1, \\dots, N$.\n        ii. After computing $u^{n+1}$, check if any of its components $u_i^{n+1}$ (for $i=1, \\dots, N$) are strictly negative.\n        iii. If any component is less than $0$, set `negativity_observed = True` and terminate the simulation for this time step.\n    e. Record the final value of `negativity_observed`.\n\n4.  The result for one parameter set is a list containing the three boolean flags and the calculated value of $\\Delta t_\\star$: $[\\text{neg\\_bad}, \\text{neg\\_border}, \\text{neg\\_good}, \\Delta t_\\star]$.\n\nFor the initial condition $u_i^0 = \\delta_{i, i^\\star}$, the first time step updates the point $u_{i^\\star}$ to $u_{i^\\star}^1 = (1 - 2\\mu)u_{i^\\star}^0 = 1 - 2\\mu$. If $\\mu > 0.5$, this value will be negative, and negativity will be observed in the very first step. If $\\mu \\le 0.5$, all coefficients are non-negative, and since the initial state is non-negative, all subsequent states will remain non-negative in exact arithmetic. Therefore, we expect the boolean results to be `[True, False, False]` for all test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_simulation(alpha, L, N, K, dt):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a single simulation for the 1D heat equation.\n\n    Args:\n        alpha (float): Thermal diffusivity.\n        L (float): Domain length.\n        N (int): Number of interior spatial points.\n        K (int): Number of time steps.\n        dt (float): Time step size.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if negativity is observed, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    dx = L / (N + 1)\n    \n    # Initialize temperature array u of size N+2 for indices 0 to N+1\n    u = np.zeros(N + 2)\n    \n    # Set initial condition: a single hot spot\n    # Note: problem statement's i_star=floor((N+1)/2) is a 1-based index if interior\n    # points are 1...N.

To gain deeper insight into this behavior, we can shift our perspective from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using Fourier analysis. This final practice challenges you to quantify the smoothing effect of the explicit scheme by calculating the decay rate of individual Fourier modes, revealing how the method preferentially dampens high-frequency (sharp) features while preserving low-frequency (smooth) ones [@problem_id:3126921]. This analysis provides a powerful analytical tool for understanding the performance of the numerical method.", "problem": "You will implement and use an explicit forward-time, centered-space finite difference scheme for the one-dimensional heat equation to measure how rapidly discrete Fourier modes are smoothed. Begin from the heat equation as the fundamental base: the temperature field satisfies $u_t = \\alpha u_{xx}$ on a spatial interval of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions, where $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity. Consider a uniform grid of $N$ points, with spatial step $\\Delta x = L/N$, and advance in time with step $\\Delta t$, using the explicit forward-in-time update coupled with a centered second-difference approximation for the spatial second derivative. Treat the initial data as a single discrete Fourier mode with integer index $m \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor\\}$.\n\nFrom these fundamentals, derive the per-time-step amplification factor for a discrete Fourier mode, and then formulate a computation for the number of time steps required for the magnitude of that mode to be attenuated to at most $e^{-1}$ times its initial magnitude. In this context, interpret attenuation in terms of the magnitude, so oscillatory sign changes are irrelevant. The quantity to output for each case is the smallest integer number of steps $n$ such that the magnitude of the mode after $n$ explicit steps is less than or equal to $e^{-1}$ times the initial magnitude. If attenuation to at most $e^{-1}$ does not occur under the given parameters (for example, the per-step magnitude factor equals $1$), output the IEEE floating-point infinity value. If the magnitude drops to zero in one step, output $1$.
