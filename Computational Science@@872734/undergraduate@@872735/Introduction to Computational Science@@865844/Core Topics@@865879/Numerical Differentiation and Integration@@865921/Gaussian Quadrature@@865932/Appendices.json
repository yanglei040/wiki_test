We will derive this result for the specific case of $n=3$ as requested.\n\nLet the quadrature rule be denoted by $Q_3(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i f(\\xi_i)$, which approximates the integral $I(f) = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) dx$. We assume this rule is exact for all polynomials of degree up to $2n-1 = 2(3)-1=5$.\n\nLet the node polynomial be $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} (x-\\xi_i)$. This is a monic polynomial of degree $3$. Let $p(x)$ be an arbitrary polynomial of degree at most $2$. Consider the polynomial $f(x) = p(x)Q(x)$. The degree of $f(x)$ is $\\text{deg}(p) + \\text{deg}(Q) \\leq 2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nBy our assumption, the quadrature rule is exact for $f(x)$, so $I(f) = Q_3(f)$.\nLet's evaluate both sides.\nThe integral is:\n$$I(f) = \\int_{-1}^{1} p(x)Q(x) dx = \\langle p, Q \\rangle$$\nThe quadrature sum is:\n$$Q_3(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i f(\\xi_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i p(\\xi_i) Q(\\xi_i)$$\nBy definition of the node polynomial $Q(x)$, its roots are the nodes $\\xi_i$. Therefore, $Q(\\xi_i) = 0$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. This leads to:\n$$Q_3(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i p(\\xi_i) \\cdot 0 = 0$$\nEquating the integral and the sum, we get:\n$$\\langle p, Q \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} p(x)Q(x) dx = 0$$\nThis holds for any polynomial $p(x)$ of degree at most $2$. This is precisely the definition of $Q(x)$ being orthogonal to the space of all polynomials of degree less than $3$.\n\nThe Legendre polynomial $P_3(x)$ is, by definition, a polynomial of degree $3$ that is orthogonal to all polynomials of degree less than $3$. The space of polynomials of degree $3$ that are orthogonal to all polynomials of degree $\\le 2$ is one-dimensional. Therefore, $Q(x)$ must be proportional to $P_3(x)$, i.e., $Q(x) = c P_3(x)$ for some non-zero constant $c$. Since the roots of $Q(x)$ are the quadrature nodes, the nodes must be the roots of $P_3(x)$.\n\nTo find the nodes, we must first construct $P_3(x)$. We can use the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process on the monomial basis $\\{1, x, x^2, x^3\\}$ with the inner product $\\langle f,g \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x)g(x)dx$.\nLet $\\tilde{P}_n(x)$ be the unnormalized polynomials.\n$\\tilde{P}_0(x) = 1$.\n$\\tilde{P}_1(x) = x - \\frac{\\langle x, 1 \\rangle}{\\langle 1, 1 \\rangle} \\cdot 1 = x - \\frac{0}{2} = x$.\n$\\tilde{P}_2(x) = x^2 - \\frac{\\langle x^2, 1 \\rangle}{\\langle 1, 1 \\rangle} \\cdot 1 - \\frac{\\langle x^2, x \\rangle}{\\langle x, x \\rangle} \\cdot x = x^2 - \\frac{2/3}{2} - \\frac{0}{2/3}x = x^2 - \\frac{1}{3}$.\n$\\tilde{P}_3(x) = x^3 - \\frac{\\langle x^3, 1 \\rangle}{\\langle 1, 1 \\rangle} \\cdot 1 - \\frac{\\langle x^3, x \\rangle}{\\langle x, x \\rangle} \\cdot x - \\frac{\\langle x^3, x^2 - 1/3 \\rangle}{\\langle x^2 - 1/3, x^2 - 1/3 \\rangle} \\cdot (x^2 - \\frac{1}{3})$.\nThe integrals involving odd powers of $x$ over $[-1, 1]$ are zero, so $\\langle x^3, 1 \\rangle=0$ and $\\langle x^3, x^2-1/3 \\rangle=0$.\nWe need $\\langle x^3, x \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^4 dx = \\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\langle x, x \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 dx = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nSo, $\\tilde{P}_3(x) = x^3 - \\frac{2/5}{2/3} x = x^3 - \\frac{3}{5}x$.\n\nThe nodes $\\xi_i$ are the roots of $\\tilde{P}_3(x)=0$:\n$$x^3 - \\frac{3}{5}x = x\\left(x^2 - \\frac{3}{5}\\right) = 0$$\nThe roots are $x=0$ and $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$.\nArranged in increasing order, the nodes are:\n$\\xi_1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$, $\\xi_2 = 0$, $\\xi_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Quadrature Weights\n\nWith the nodes determined, we find the weights $w_1, w_2, w_3$ by enforcing that the rule is exact for a basis of low-degree polynomials. A basis for polynomials of degree $\\le 2$ is $\\{1, x, x^2\\}$. The rule must be exact for these.\n\nFor $f(x)=1$ (degree $0$):\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} 1 \\,dx = 2 \\implies w_1 f(\\xi_1) + w_2 f(\\xi_2) + w_3 f(\\xi_3) = w_1+w_2+w_3 = 2$$\n\nFor $f(x)=x$ (degree $1$):\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} x \\,dx = 0 \\implies w_1 \\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right) + w_2(0) + w_3 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}(-w_1+w_3) = 0$$\nThis implies $w_1 = w_3$.\n\nFor $f(x)=x^2$ (degree $2$):\n$$\\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 \\,dx = \\frac{2}{3} \\implies w_1 \\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right)^2 + w_2(0)^2 + w_3 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right)^2 = w_1\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + w_3\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThis gives $\\frac{3}{5}(w_1+w_3) = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nWe now solve the system of linear equations for the weights:\n1. $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 2$\n2. $w_1 = w_3$\n3. $\\frac{3}{5}(w_1+w_3) = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nSubstitute (2) into (3):\n$\\frac{3}{5}(w_1+w_1) = \\frac{2}{3} \\implies \\frac{6}{5}w_1 = \\frac{2}{3} \\implies w_1 = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{10}{18} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\nFrom (2), $w_3 = w_1 = \\frac{5}{9}$.\nSubstitute $w_1$ and $w_3$ into (1):\n$\\frac{5}{9} + w_2 + \\frac{5}{9} = 2 \\implies w_2 + \\frac{10}{9} = 2 \\implies w_2 = 2 - \\frac{10}{9} = \\frac{18-10}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$.\n\nThe weights are $w_1 = \\frac{5}{9}$, $w_2 = \\frac{8}{9}$, $w_3 = \\frac{5}{9}$.\n\n### Step 3: Verification of the Degree of Exactness\n\nWe must explain why this rule, constructed to be exact for polynomials of degree up to $2$, is in fact exact for all polynomials of degree up to $5$.\nLet $f(x)$ be any polynomial of degree at most $5$. We can perform polynomial division of $f(x)$ by the degree-$3$ node polynomial $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^3(x-\\xi_i) \\propto P_3(x)$. This gives:\n$$f(x) = d(x)Q(x) + r(x)$$\nwhere the quotient $d(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $5-3=2$, and the remainder $r(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $2$.\n\nApplying the integral operator $I$ to $f(x)$:\n$$I(f) = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( d(x)Q(x) + r(x) \\right) dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} d(x)Q(x) dx + \\int_{-1}^{1} r(x) dx$$\nSince $Q(x)$ is proportional to $P_3(x)$ and $d(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $2$, the orthogonality property of Legendre polynomials ensures that $\\int_{-1}^{1} d(x)Q(x) dx = 0$.\nThus, $I(f) = \\int_{-1}^{1} r(x) dx = I(r)$.\n\nNow, applying the quadrature rule $Q_3$ to $f(x)$:\n$$Q_3(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i f(\\xi_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \\left( d(\\xi_i)Q(\\xi_i) + r(\\xi_i) \\right)$$\nSince $\\xi_i$ are the roots of $Q(x)$, $Q(\\xi_i)=0$ for each node. The expression simplifies to:\n$$Q_3(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i r(\\xi_i) = Q_3(r)$$\n\nWe have shown that $I(f) = I(r)$ and $Q_3(f) = Q_3(r)$. The remainder $r(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $2$. By our construction of the weights, the quadrature rule is exact for all polynomials of degree at most $2$. Therefore, $I(r) = Q_3(r)$.\nCombining these results, we conclude that $I(f)=Q_3(f)$ for any polynomial $f(x)$ of degree at most $5$. The degree of exactness is $5$.\n\nThe final result is the set of nodes and weights.\nNodes: $\\xi_1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$, $\\xi_2 = 0$, $\\xi_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$.\nWeights: $w_1 = \\frac{5}{9}$, $w_2 = \\frac{8}{9}$, $w_3 = \\frac{5}{9}$.\nIn the requested order $(\\xi_1, \\xi_2, \\xi_3, w_1, w_2, w_3)$:\n$\\left( -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}, 0, \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}, \\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{8}{9}, \\frac{5}{9} \\right)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}} & 0 & \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}} & \\frac{5}{9} & \\frac{8}{9} & \\frac{5}{9} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3136381"}, {"introduction": "After understanding how a quadrature rule is built, the next step is to apply it to a practical problem.

The integrand $f(x) = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ is continuous on the closed interval $[-1, 1]$. However, its derivatives are singular at the endpoints $x = \\pm 1$. The first derivative is $f'(x) = -x(1-x^2)^{-1/2}$, which diverges as $x \\to \\pm 1$. Because standard error bounds for numerical quadrature rules depend on the boundedness of higher-order derivatives of the integrand over the integration interval, the presence of these singularities is expected to degrade the convergence performance of both methods under consideration.\n\nWe will compare two families of quadrature rules: $n$-point Gauss–Legendre quadrature and composite Simpson's rule. For a fair comparison, the number of function evaluations, $n$, will be identical for both methods, drawn from the set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{3, 5, 9, 17, 33\\}$.\n\nFirst, let us define the Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The $n$-point rule approximates the integral of a function $g(x)$ over $[-1, 1]$ as a weighted sum of function values at specific nodes:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} g(x) \\, dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i g(x_i) = Q_{\\mathrm{GL}}(n).\n$$\nThe nodes $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ are the roots of the $n$-th degree Legendre polynomial, $P_n(x)$, and the weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ are chosen such that the rule is exact for all polynomials of degree up to $2n-1$. A critical feature of Gauss-Legendre quadrature is that its nodes are always located in the open interval $(-1, 1)$, thus avoiding direct function evaluation at the singular endpoints of our problem. For an analytic function, this method exhibits exponential convergence. For a function with an endpoint singularity of the form $(1 \\mp x)^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha > -1$, the error is known to behave as $E_{\\mathrm{GL}}(n) = O(n^{-2(\\alpha+1)})$. In our case, $\\alpha = 1/2$, so we anticipate an algebraic convergence rate with an exponent of $p_{\\mathrm{GL}} \\approx 2(1/2 + 1) = 3$.\n\nSecond, we consider the composite Simpson's rule. This rule is derived from the closed Newton–Cotes formula of degree $2$. The interval $[-1, 1]$ is partitioned into $m$ equal subintervals of width $h = 2/m$. The problem specifies using $n$ total function evaluations, which for composite Simpson's rule corresponds to $m = n-1$ subintervals. The nodes are evenly spaced at $x_j = -1 + j \\cdot h$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$. The approximation is given by:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} g(x) \\, dx \\approx \\frac{h}{3} \\left[ g(x_0) + 4\\sum_{j=1}^{m/2} g(x_{2j-1}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{m/2-1} g(x_{2j}) + g(x_m) \\right] = Q_{\\mathrm{S}}(n).\n$$\nUnlike Gauss-Legendre quadrature, this method explicitly evaluates the function at the endpoints $x_0 = -1$ and $x_m = 1$. For a sufficiently smooth function ($g \\in C^4([-1, 1])$), the error is $O(h^4) = O(m^{-4}) = O(n^{-4})$. However, due to the endpoint singularities, this rate will not be achieved. The error for a Newton-Cotes rule applied to an integrand with a singularity $(1 \\mp x)^\\alpha$ is typically $O(m^{-(\\alpha+k)})$, where $k$ depends on the rule's degree. For Simpson's rule, theory suggests the error behaves as $E_{\\mathrm{S}}(n) = O(m^{-(\\alpha+1.5)})$ for a one-sided singularity. Here, with two endpoints and $\\alpha=1/2$, the expected convergence exponent is $p_{\\mathrm{S}} \\approx 1.5$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For each budget $n \\in \\mathcal{B}$, we compute the approximations $Q_{\\mathrm{GL}}(n)$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{S}}(n)$. For $Q_{\\mathrm{GL}}(n)$, the nodes and weights for the Legendre polynomials are required. For $Q_{\\mathrm{S}}(n)$, we use $m = n-1$ subintervals.\n2. The absolute errors, $E_{\\mathrm{GL}}(n) = |Q_{\\mathrm{GL}}(n) - \\pi/2|$ and $E_{\\mathrm{S}}(n) = |Q_{\\mathrm{S}}(n) - \\pi/2|$, are calculated for each $n$.\n3. To estimate the empirical convergence exponents, we perform a linear regression on the logarithm of the errors against the logarithm of the number of points. We fit the models:\n$$\n\\log E(n) \\approx \\alpha + s \\log n.\n$$\nThe slope $s$ is determined using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) fit. From the definition of algebraic convergence, $E(n) \\approx C n^{-p}$, taking the logarithm gives $\\log E(n) \\approx \\log C - p \\log n$. By comparison with the linear model, the empirical convergence exponent is $p = -s$. We will calculate $p_{\\mathrm{GL}} = -s_{\\mathrm{GL}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{S}} = -s_{\\mathrm{S}}$.\n\nThis systematic comparison will reveal the practical impact of endpoint singularities on the convergence of a high-order (Gauss-Legendre) and a low-order (Simpson's) quadrature rule, providing a clear quantitative measure of their performance degradation from the ideal, smooth-function case. The entire procedure will be implemented in a program to generate the required numerical results.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import special\nfrom scipy import integrate\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the convergence of Gauss-Legendre and composite Simpson's rule\n    for the integral of sqrt(1-x^2) on [-1, 1], which has endpoint singularities.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the integrand and the exact value of the integral.\n    def f(x):\n        # Use np.maximum to avoid domain errors from floating-point inaccuracies near +/-1.\n        return np.sqrt(np.maximum(0.0, 1.0 - x**2))\n\n    I_exact = np.pi / 2.0\n\n    # Test suite of budgets for the number of function evaluations.\n    budgets = np.array([3, 5, 9, 17, 33])\n\n    errors_gl = []\n    errors_s = []\n    results_list = []\n\n    for n in budgets:\n        # --- Gauss-Legendre Quadrature ---\n        # Get n-point Gauss-Legendre nodes and weights on [-1, 1].\n        # scipy.special.roots_legendre is the standard function for this.\n        nodes, weights = special.roots_legendre(n)\n        \n        # Calculate the approximation Q_GL(n).\n        q_gl = np.sum(weights * f(nodes))\n        \n        # Calculate the absolute error E_GL(n).\n        e_gl = np.abs(q_gl - I_exact)\n        errors_gl.append(e_gl)\n\n        # --- Composite Simpson's Rule ---\n        # Number of subintervals m = n - 1.
