Mathematical Derivation of Parseval's Theorem**\n\nWe are given the following definitions for a finite, discrete-time sequence $x[n]$ of length $N$, where $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$:\n\n- Forward DFT: $X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\, e^{-j 2\\pi kn/N}$\n- Inverse DFT: $x[n] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] \\, e^{j 2\\pi kn/N}$\n\nThe objective is to establish a relationship between the time-domain energy, defined as the squared $\\ell_2$-norm of the sequence $x[n]$,\n$$E_{\\mathrm{time}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x[n]|^2$$\nand the frequency-domain energy, defined with a specific scaling factor as\n$$E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X[k]|^2$$\n\nWe begin the derivation from the expression for the frequency-domain energy, $E_{\\mathrm{freq}}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X[k]|^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] X^*[k]$$\nwhere $X^*[k]$ denotes the complex conjugate of $X[k]$.\n\nSubstitute the definition of the forward DFT for $X[k]$ and its conjugate for $X^*[k]$. For clarity, we use a distinct summation index $m$ for the conjugate term.\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j 2\\pi kn/N}$$\n$$X^*[k] = \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[m] e^{-j 2\\pi km/N} \\right)^* = \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x^*[m] e^{j 2\\pi km/N}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{freq}}$ yields:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j 2\\pi kn/N} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x^*[m] e^{j 2\\pi km/N} \\right)$$\n\nWe can rearrange the order of summation, as the sums are finite:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[n] x^*[m] \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{-j 2\\pi kn/N} e^{j 2\\pi km/N} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[n] x^*[m] \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{j 2\\pi k(m-n)/N} \\right)$$\n\nThe innermost sum, over the index $k$, is a geometric series of complex exponentials. It exhibits a fundamental orthogonality property:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{j 2\\pi k(m-n)/N} = \\begin{cases} N & \\text{if } m = n \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } m \\neq n \\end{cases} $$\nThis can be written compactly using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{m,n}$, as $N \\delta_{m,n}$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $E_{\\mathrm{freq}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[n] x^*[m] (N \\delta_{m,n})$$\n\nThe factor of $N$ cancels. The Kronecker delta $\\delta_{m,n}$ causes the inner sum over $m$ to be non-zero only when $m=n$. This collapses the double summation into a single summation:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] x^*[n]$$\n\nSince $z z^* = |z|^2$ for any complex number $z$, we arrive at the final result:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x[n]|^2$$\n\nThis proves that, for the given DFT convention, the defined time-domain and frequency-domain energies are identical:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{time}} = E_{\\mathrm{freq}}$$\n\n**2. Numerical Verification Design**\n\nThe second part of the task is to numerically verify this identity. Due to the finite precision of floating-point arithmetic, a direct equality check $E_{\\mathrm{time}} == E_{\\mathrm{freq}}$ is ill-advised. Instead, we compute the dimensionless relative discrepancy, $r$, defined as:\n$$\nr \\;=\\; \\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\big| E_{\\mathrm{time}} - E_{\\mathrm{freq}} \\big|}{\\max\\{E_{\\mathrm{time}}, E_{\\mathrm{freq}}\\}}, & \\text{if } \\max\\{E_{\\mathrm{time}}, E_{\\mathrm{freq}}\\} > 0,\\\\\n0, & \\text{if } E_{\\mathrm{time}} = E_{\\mathrm{freq}} = 0,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTheoretically, $r$ should be exactly $0$. In practice, we expect $r$ to be a small number on the order of machine epsilon, reflecting the accumulation of floating-point rounding errors.\n\nThe numerical implementation will use Python with the NumPy library. The function `numpy.fft.fft` computes the forward DFT according to the definition $X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j 2\\pi kn/N}$, which exactly matches the unnormalized convention specified in the problem.\n\nThe verification will be performed on six distinct test cases, each designed to probe different aspects of the DFT:\n- **Case A**: A sequence of random complex numbers of length $N=128$, representing a general, aperiodic signal. The real and imaginary parts are drawn from a standard normal distribution with a fixed seed for reproducibility.\n- **Case B**: A single-frequency complex exponential of length $N=64$, $x[n] = 1.2 e^{j0.4} \\, e^{j 2\\pi (7) n / 64}$. Its DFT is non-zero at only a single frequency bin, representing a spectrally pure signal.\n- **Case C**: A real-valued sinusoid of length $N=36$ whose frequency $f=\\sqrt{2}$ is not an integer multiple of the bin resolution $1/N$. This tests the case of spectral leakage, where energy is distributed across all frequency bins.\n- **Case D**: A discrete impulse of length $N=50$, $x[n] = 3.0$ at $n=17$ and $0$ otherwise. Its transform has a constant magnitude across all frequencies.\n- **Case E**: A real-valued linear ramp sequence of length $N=32$, centered to have zero mean.\n- **Case F**: The trivial case of a zero sequence of length $N=10$, for which both energies are analytically zero.\n\nFor each case, the program will generate the sequence $x[n]$, compute $X[k]$ via `numpy.fft.fft`, then calculate $E_{\\mathrm{time}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{freq}}$, and the relative discrepancy $r$.

We shall proceed with a step-by-step implementation and analysis.\n\nThe core principle is the duality between multiplication in the frequency domain and convolution in the spatial domain. Filtering an image $x[n,m]$ with a filter whose impulse response is $h[n,m]$ is a convolution operation: $y[n,m] = (x * h)[n,m]$. According to the convolution theorem, this is equivalent to pointwise multiplication of their respective DFTs: $Y[u,v] = X[u,v] \\cdot H[u,v]$, where $X = \\mathcal{F}\\{x\\}$ and $H = \\mathcal{F}\\{h\\}$. An ideal low-pass filter is defined by a sharp cutoff in the frequency domain, which corresponds to a filter mask $H[u,v]$ that is unity inside a certain frequency radius and zero outside.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Synthetic Image**\nA synthetic test image $I \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ is constructed to have a single, sharp vertical edge.

The value of the image is constant along the vertical direction.\n\n**Step 2: Transformation to the Frequency Domain and Filter Design**\nFirst, the two-dimensional DFT of the image $I[i,j]$ is computed to obtain its frequency-domain representation, $F[u,v] = \\mathcal{F}\\{I\\}$.\n$$\nF[u,v] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} I[n,m] \\, \\exp\\!\\left(-2\\pi i \\left(\\frac{un}{N} + \\frac{vm}{N}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNext, a circular low-pass filter mask $H[u,v]$ is constructed. This mask is designed in a \"shifted\" frequency space, where the zero-frequency component $(u=0, v=0)$ is at the center of the $N \\times N$ grid. The centered frequency indices $u,v$ range from $-N/2$ to $N/2-1$. For each frequency coordinate $(u,v)$, the Euclidean distance from the origin is calculated as $d = \\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}$. The \"brick-wall\" mask $H$ is then defined based on a cutoff radius $r_c$:\n$$\nH[u,v] = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} \\le r_c \\\\\n0, & \\text{if } \\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} > r_c\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis mask will be applied to the frequency spectrum of the image, also arranged in this centered configuration.\n\n**Step 3: Filtering and Inverse Transformation**\nThe filtering operation is a pointwise multiplication of the centered image spectrum, $F_{\\text{shifted}}$, with the filter mask $H$.\n$$\nG_{\\text{shifted}}[u,v] = F_{\\text{shifted}}[u,v] \\cdot H[u,v]\n$$\nTo correctly compute the inverse DFT, the resulting filtered spectrum $G_{\\text{shifted}}$ must be shifted back to the standard DFT layout where the zero-frequency component is at the origin (index $(0,0)$). Let this be $G$. The filtered image in the spatial domain, $\\widehat{I}[i,j]$, is then obtained by applying the inverse two-dimensional DFT to $G[u,v]$.\n$$\n\\widehat{I}_{\\text{complex}}[i,j] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{G\\} = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{u=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{v=0}^{N-1} G[u,v] \\, \\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\left(\\frac{ui}{N} + \\frac{vj}{N}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince the original image $I$ is real-valued and the filter mask $H$ has conjugate symmetry ($H[u,v] = H[-u,-v]$), the filtered spectrum $G$ will also possess conjugate symmetry. Consequently, its inverse DFT, $\\widehat{I}_{\\text{complex}}$, should be purely real, up to numerical precision errors. We retain only the real part: $\\widehat{I}[i,j] = \\text{real}(\\widehat{I}_{\\text{complex}}[i,j])$.\n\n**Step 4: Quantification of Artifacts**\nThe Gibbs phenomenon manifests as oscillations, or \"ringing,\" near the discontinuity. We quantify this effect on the center row of the image, $p[j] = \\widehat{I}[N/2, j]$, where $N=128$. The edge is at column index $c_0 = N/2 = 64$.\n- The peak overshoot, $\\Delta^+$, measures the maximum value of the profile $p[j]$ above the high-level asymptote (which is $1$) on the bright side of the edge, within a window of half-width $W=32$.\n$$\n\\Delta^+ = \\max\\left(0, \\max_{j \\in \\{64,\\dots,96\\}} \\big(p[j] - 1\\big)\\right)\n$$\n- The peak undershoot, $\\Delta^-$, measures the maximum deviation of $p[j]$ below the low-level asymptote (which is $0$) on the dark side of the edge, within the window.\n$$\n\\Delta^- = \\max\\left(0, \\max_{j \\in \\{32,\\dots,63\\}} \\big(0 - p[j]\\big)\\right)\n$$\n- The overall reconstruction quality is measured by the Mean-Squared Error (MSE) between the filtered image $\\widehat{I}$ and the original image $I$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\big(\\widehat{I}[i,j] - I[i,j]\\big)^2\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Execution for Test Cases**\nThe above procedure is executed for each specified cutoff radius $r_c \\in \\{0, 8, 16, 128\\}$, with $N=128$ and $W=32$. The resulting triplet $[\\Delta^+, \\Delta^-, \\mathrm{MSE}]$ for each $r_c$ is calculated and formatted.\n\n- For $r_c=0$, only the DC component ($u=0,v=0$) is passed. The reconstructed image $\\widehat{I}$ is uniform with a value equal to the average intensity of the original image, which is $0.5$. This results in $\\Delta^+=0$, $\\Delta^-=0$, and $\\mathrm{MSE}=0.25$.\n- For $r_c=128$, the radius is large enough to pass all frequency components of the $128 \\times 128$ grid. Thus, $H$ is an all-pass filter, and $\\widehat{I}$ should be nearly identical to $I$, resulting in minimal artifacts and error.\n- The intermediate cases $r_c=8$ and $r_c=16$ will exhibit the characteristic ringing artifacts.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a 2D ideal low-pass filter and quantifies ringing artifacts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters from the problem statement.\n    N = 128\n    W = 32\n    test_rcs = [0, 8, 16, 128]\n    c0 = N // 2\n\n    # Step 1: Construct the synthetic binary step image I.\n    I = np.zeros((N, N), dtype=float)\n    I[:, c0:] = 1.0\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the 2D DFT of I.\n    F = np.fft.fft2(I)\n    \n    # Pre-calculate frequency grid for mask generation.\n    # The grid is created in the \"shifted\" or centered representation.\n    freqs_1d = np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.fftfreq(N) * N)\n    u, v = np.meshgrid(freqs_1d, freqs_1d, indexing='ij')\n    radius_grid = np.sqrt(u**2 + v**2)\n    \n    # Store the shifted spectrum of the image.\n    F_shifted = np.fft.fftshift(F)\n\n    results_data = []\n    \n    for r_c in test_rcs:\n        # Step 2 (cont.): Design the circular brick-wall low-pass mask H.\n        H = (radius_grid <= r_c).astype(float)\n\n        # Step 3: Form the filtered spectrum and compute the inverse DFT.\n        # Apply the mask via pointwise multiplication in the frequency domain.\n        G_shifted = F_shifted * H\n        \n        # Shift the filtered spectrum back to the standard DFT layout.\n        G = np.fft.ifftshift(G_shifted)\n        \n        # Compute the inverse 2D DFT.\n        I_hat_complex = np.fft.ifft2(G)\n        \n        # Retain the real part of the reconstructed image.\n        I_hat = np.real(I_hat_complex)\n\n        # Step 4: Quantify ringing artifacts and MSE.\n        # Extract the center-row profile.\n        p = I_hat[N // 2, :]\n\n        # Calculate peak overshoot (Delta+).\n        # Interval: j from c0 to c0+W.
