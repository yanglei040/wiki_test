This domain is partitioned into $p$ subdomains, arranged as a $\\sqrt{p} \\times \\sqrt{p}$ array of contiguous rectangular blocks.

Communication volume is therefore generated exclusively at the internal interfaces between adjacent subdomains. The principle is that this volume is proportional to the number of interface degrees of freedom. We begin by quantifying these interfaces.\n\nThe $\\sqrt{p} \\times \\sqrt{p}$ arrangement of subdomains creates a grid of interfaces. We can count the horizontal and vertical interfaces separately.\nThere are $\\sqrt{p}$ columns of subdomains. This arrangement creates $\\sqrt{p}-1$ columns of vertical interfaces. Each of these vertical interface columns spans the full height of the domain, which is composed of $\\sqrt{p}$ subdomains.

Each of these horizontal interface rows spans the full width of the domain, which is composed of $\\sqrt{p}$ subdomains. Thus, each row of horizontal interfaces consists of $\\sqrt{p}$ distinct interface segments.

The length of any such edge corresponds to the number of grid points along one side of a subdomain, which is $m$.\n\nNext, we quantify the communication volume associated with a single interface. The halo exchange has a width of $1$ grid point. For any pair of neighboring subdomains, say $A$ and $B$, sharing an interface of length $m$, subdomain $A$ sends a layer of $m$ scalar values to subdomain $B$, and subdomain $B$ sends a layer of $m$ scalar values to subdomain $A$. The problem defines the total communication volume, $V$, as the sum of all scalar values sent across all process boundaries, counting both directions of each exchange. For a single interface, the volume contribution is the sum of the data sent in both directions:\n$$\nV_{iface} = m + m = 2m\n$$\nThe total communication volume per iteration, $V$, is the product of the total number of internal interfaces, $N_{iface}$, and the communication volume per interface, $V_{iface}$.\n$$\nV = N_{iface} \\times V_{iface} = \\left( 2\\sqrt{p}(\\sqrt{p}-1) \\right) \\times (2m)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $m = \\frac{n}{\\sqrt{p}}$ into the equation for $V$ to express the total volume as a function of $n$ and $p$:\n$$\nV = \\left( 2\\sqrt{p}(\\sqrt{p}-1) \\right) \\times \\left( 2 \\frac{n}{\\sqrt{p}} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\sqrt{p}$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leading to the simplified expression:\n$$\nV = 2(\\sqrt{p}-1) \\times 2n\n$$\n$$\nV = 4n(\\sqrt{p}-1)\n$$\nThis expression represents the exact total communication volume per iteration.

The overlap buffers supply redundant unknowns across subdomain boundaries via ghost layers, but do not modify the physical mesh geometry or the underlying FVM flux balances.\n\nFundamental base for reasoning: In an explicit FVM update, conservation implies that the change in a cell average over one time step is determined by the net flux through the cell edges divided by the cell area. Stability and positivity arguments enforce that the advective or wave flux leaving any cell during one time step cannot exceed the quantity present in the cell. For a cut-cell with one open fluid edge of length $\\ell_{\\text{open}}$ and reduced area $A_i$, this principle constrains the time step by comparing the cell content scale to the maximum outgoing flux scale, which is proportional to $c$ and the open edge length.\n\nConsider the following concrete configuration: $h = 100\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $H = 10\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, and a smallest cut-cell with $\\alpha = 0.05$.

The overlap width $\\delta$ provides ghost layers so that each subdomain solves on an extended region, incorporating neighboring information from adjacent subdomains. Overlap buffers do not modify the physical mesh geometry: the areas $A_i$ and edge lengths $L_e$ remain the same. Therefore, the explicit stability limit driven by the smallest $A_i$ and the corresponding $\\ell_{\\text{open}}$ is unaffected by overlap. However, increasing overlap improves the quality of inter-subdomain coupling and reduces numerical artifacts near subdomain boundaries and geometric singularities (such as re-entrant corners), which can manifest as interface oscillations or slow convergence of iterative solvers. In classical Schwarz theory, larger overlap generally improves convergence (reduces iteration counts) by enlarging the set of shared unknowns and enhancing information propagation, but at the cost of increased communication and redundant computations. Conservation in the underlying FVM update is preserved because the flux balances are defined on the physical mesh and do not depend on the domain partitioning.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA.

This states the correct scaling derived from conservation: $\\Delta t \\sim A_i/(c \\,\\ell_{\\text{open}})$, which under the stated geometry reduces to $\\Delta t \\sim \\alpha h / c$, and asserts that overlap primarily improves convergence and reduces interface artifacts without altering this limit. This matches our derivation and understanding. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. This asserts that overlap buffers modify the mesh geometry by increasing the smallest fluid area near boundaries, removing geometric singularities from the discrete operator. Overlap does not alter the physical mesh; it only augments the computational subdomains with ghost layers. Geometric singularities (sharp corners, narrow channels) remain in the discrete operator; overlap can mitigate their numerical impact on iterations but does not remove them structurally.
