A predicted box is defined by its center $(\\hat{x}, \\hat{y})$, width $\\hat{w}$, and height $\\hat{h}$.\n\n(a) Special Case: Co-centered Boxes\n\nFirst, we consider the special case where the boxes share the same center, i.e., $(\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}) = (x, y)$.\n\nAn axis-aligned rectangle can be described by the Cartesian product of two closed intervals on the horizontal and vertical axes.\nThe ground-truth box corresponds to the horizontal interval $[x - w/2, x + w/2]$ and the vertical interval $[y - h/2, y + h/2]$.\nThe predicted box, sharing the same center, corresponds to the horizontal interval $[x - \\hat{w}/2, x + \\hat{w}/2]$ and the vertical interval $[y - \\hat{h}/2, y + \\hat{h}/2]$.\n\nThe area of intersection of two axis-aligned rectangles is the product of the lengths of the intersections of their corresponding 1D intervals.\nThe intersection of the two horizontal intervals $[x - w/2, x + w/2]$ and $[x - \\hat{w}/2, x + \\hat{w}/2]$ is another interval centered at $x$. Its half-width is the minimum of the two half-widths, i.e., $\\min(w/2, \\hat{w}/2)$. The length of this intersection is $2 \\cdot \\min(w/2, \\hat{w}/2) = \\min(w, \\hat{w})$.\nSimilarly, the length of the intersection of the two vertical intervals is $\\min(h, \\hat{h})$.\n\nThe area of intersection, $A_I$, is therefore:\n$$A_I = \\min(w, \\hat{w}) \\cdot \\min(h, \\hat{h})$$\n\nThe area of the union of two sets is given by the principle of inclusion-exclusion: $A_U = A_{GT} + A_P - A_I$, where $A_{GT} = wh$ is the area of the ground-truth box and $A_P = \\hat{w}\\hat{h}$ is the area of the predicted box.\n$$A_U = wh + \\hat{w}\\hat{h} - \\min(w, \\hat{w}) \\min(h, \\hat{h})$$\n\nThe Intersection over Union, $\\mathrm{IoU}$, is the ratio of these two areas:\n$$\\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{A_I}{A_U} = \\frac{\\min(w, \\hat{w}) \\min(h, \\hat{h})}{wh + \\hat{w}\\hat{h} - \\min(w, \\hat{w}) \\min(h, \\hat{h})}$$\n\nTo argue why maximizing $\\mathrm{IoU}$ reduces to minimizing the absolute differences $|w - \\hat{w}|$ and $|h - \\hat{h}|$, we analyze the $\\mathrm{IoU}$ expression. Maximizing the fraction is equivalent to minimizing its reciprocal:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{IoU}} = \\frac{wh + \\hat{w}\\hat{h}}{\\min(w, \\hat{w}) \\min(h, \\hat{h})} - 1 = \\frac{w}{\\min(w, \\hat{w})} \\frac{h}{\\min(h, \\hat{h})} + \\frac{\\hat{w}}{\\min(w, \\hat{w})} \\frac{\\hat{h}}{\\min(h, \\hat{h})} - 1$$\nLet's analyze the ratios. The term $\\frac{w}{\\min(w, \\hat{w})}$ is equal to $1$ if $w \\le \\hat{w}$ and $w/\\hat{w}$ if $w > \\hat{w}$. This can be compactly written as $\\max(1, w/\\hat{w})$. Similarly, $\\frac{\\hat{w}}{\\min(w, \\hat{w})} = \\max(1, \\hat{w}/w)$. Substituting these into the expression gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{IoU}} = \\max\\left(1, \\frac{w}{\\hat{w}}\\right) \\max\\left(1, \\frac{h}{\\hat{h}}\\right) + \\max\\left(1, \\frac{\\hat{w}}{w}\\right) \\max\\left(1, \\frac{\\hat{h}}{h}\\right) - 1$$\nEach ratio term, like $\\max(1, w/\\hat{w})$, is always greater than or equal to $1$. The minimum value of this expression is achieved when all ratios are exactly $1$. This occurs if and only if $w = \\hat{w}$ and $h = \\hat{h}$. In this case, $1/\\mathrm{IoU} = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 = 1$, which means $\\mathrm{IoU}=1$, the maximum possible value.\nAny deviation of $\\hat{w}$ from $w$ (i.e., $|w - \\hat{w}| > 0$) or $\\hat{h}$ from $h$ (i.e., $|h - \\hat{h}| > 0$) will make at least one of the ratios strictly greater than $1$. For instance, if $\\hat{w} < w$, then $w/\\hat{w} > 1$, making $\\max(1, w/\\hat{w}) > 1$. This increases the value of $1/\\mathrm{IoU}$ and thus decreases the $\\mathrm{IoU}$. Therefore, maximizing $\\mathrm{IoU}$ in this co-centered case is equivalent to forcing $\\hat{w} \\to w$ and $\\hat{h} \\to h$, which is the same as minimizing $|w - \\hat{w}|$ and $|h - \\hat{h}|$.\n\n(b) General Case: Off-center Boxes\n\nNow we extend the derivation to the general case with center offsets $\\Delta x = \\hat{x} - x$ and $\\Delta y = \\hat{y} - y$. The ground-truth box has horizontal interval $[x_1, x_2] = [x - w/2, x + w/2]$ and vertical interval $[y_1, y_2] = [y - h/2, y + h/2]$. The predicted box has horizontal interval $[\\hat{x}_1, \\hat{x}_2] = [\\hat{x} - \\hat{w}/2, \\hat{x} + \\hat{w}/2]$ and vertical interval $[\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2] = [\\hat{y} - \\hat{h}/2, \\hat{y} + \\hat{h}/2]$.\n\nThe length of the intersection of two intervals $[a,b]$ and $[c,d]$ is given by $\\max(0, \\min(b, d) - \\max(a, c))$.\nThe overlapped horizontal extent, $W_{int}$, is:\n$$W_{int} = \\max(0, \\min(x_2, \\hat{x}_2) - \\max(x_1, \\hat{x}_1)) = \\max\\left(0, \\min\\left(x + \\frac{w}{2}, \\hat{x} + \\frac{\\hat{w}}{2}\\right) - \\max\\left(x - \\frac{w}{2}, \\hat{x} - \\frac{\\hat{w}}{2}\\right)\\right)$$\nSimilarly, the overlapped vertical extent, $H_{int}$, is:\n$$H_{int} = \\max(0, \\min(y_2, \\hat{y}_2) - \\max(y_1, \\hat{y}_1)) = \\max\\left(0, \\min\\left(y + \\frac{h}{2}, \\hat{y} + \\frac{\\hat{h}}{2}\\right) - \\max\\left(y - \\frac{h}{2}, \\hat{y} - \\frac{\\hat{h}}{2}\\right)\\right)$$\nThese expressions are general and are functions of the centers and dimensions of both boxes. Although the length of the intersection is symmetric with respect to the sign of the offset (e.g., depends on $|\\Delta x|$), expressing $W_{int}$ solely in terms of $w$, $\\hat{w}$ and $|\\Delta x|$ without using min/max functions or case analysis is not possible due to the complex interaction between relative sizes and positions.\n\nThe area of intersection is $A_I = W_{int} \\cdot H_{int}$.\nThe area of union is $A_U = wh + \\hat{w}\\hat{h} - A_I$.\nThe general $\\mathrm{IoU}$ expression is:\n$$\\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{W_{int} \\cdot H_{int}}{wh + \\hat{w}\\hat{h} - W_{int} \\cdot H_{int}}$$\n\nNow, we discuss whether errors in center location $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ and errors in size $(\\hat{w}, \\hat{h})$ can be decoupled for the purpose of maximizing $\\mathrm{IoU}$. The parameters are coupled. The expression for $W_{int}$ depends on both the center coordinates $(x, \\hat{x})$ and the widths $(w, \\hat{w})$. Likewise, $H_{int}$ depends on $(y, \\hat{y})$ and $(h, \\hat{h})$. The $\\mathrm{IoU}$ is a non-linear function of these intersection extents.\n$$\\mathrm{IoU}(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\hat{w}, \\hat{h}) = \\frac{W_{int}(\\Delta x, \\hat{w}) \\cdot H_{int}(\\Delta y, \\hat{h})}{wh + \\hat{w}\\hat{h} - W_{int}(\\Delta x, \\hat{w}) \\cdot H_{int}(\\Delta y, \\hat{h})}$$\nThe variables are not separable in this function. For example, the gradient of $\\mathrm{IoU}$ with respect to $\\hat{w}$ depends on $\\Delta x, \\Delta y,$ and $\\hat{h}$. The effect of a change in width, $\\Delta \\hat{w}$, on the $\\mathrm{IoU}$ is modulated by the current offset $\\Delta x$. If $|\\Delta x|$ is large such that the boxes are far apart horizontally ($W_{int}=0$), a small change in $\\hat{w}$ will have no effect on $A_I$ and thus little to no effect on $\\mathrm{IoU}$. However, if the boxes are perfectly centered horizontally ($\\Delta x = 0$), the same change in $\\hat{w}$ can have a significant impact on $W_{int}$ and thus on $\\mathrm{IoU}$, as shown in part (a). Because the sensitivity of $\\mathrm{IoU}$ to an error in one parameter (e.g., $\\hat{w}$) depends on the value of another parameter (e.g., $\\Delta x$), the errors cannot be considered decoupled. Therefore, to maximize $\\mathrm{IoU}$, one must simultaneously optimize all four prediction parameters: $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{w}, \\hat{h}$.\n\n(c) Numerical Computation\n\nWe are given the following configuration:\nGround-truth box: center $(x, y)=(0, 0)$, width $w=6$, height $h=4$.\nPredicted box: center $(\\hat{x}, \\hat{y})=(1, -0.5)$, width $\\hat{w}=5$, height $\\hat{h}=3$.\n\nFirst, we determine the coordinates of the box boundaries.\nFor the ground-truth box:\n$x_1 = x - w/2 = 0 - 6/2 = -3$\n$x_2 = x + w/2 = 0 + 6/2 = 3$\n$y_1 = y - h/2 = 0 - 4/2 = -2$\n$y_2 = y + h/2 = 0 + 4/2 = 2$\n\nFor the predicted box:\n$\\hat{x}_1 = \\hat{x} - \\hat{w}/2 = 1 - 5/2 = -1.5$\n$\\hat{x}_2 = \\hat{x} + \\hat{w}/2 = 1 + 5/2 = 3.5$\n$\\hat{y}_1 = \\hat{y} - \\hat{h}/2 = -0.5 - 3/2 = -2$\n$\\hat{y}_2 = \\hat{y} + \\hat{h}/2 = -0.5 + 3/2 = 1$\n\nNext, we compute the overlapped extents using the formulas from part (b).\n$W_{int} = \\max(0, \\min(x_2, \\hat{x}_2) - \\max(x_1, \\hat{x}_1)) = \\max(0, \\min(3, 3.5) - \\max(-3, -1.5)) = \\min(3, 3.5) - \\max(-3, -1.5) = 3 - (-1.5) = 4.5$.\n$H_{int} = \\max(0, \\min(y_2, \\hat{y}_2) - \\max(y_1, \\hat{y}_1)) = \\max(0, \\min(2, 1) - \\max(-2, -2)) = \\min(2, 1) - \\max(-2, -2) = 1 - (-2) = 3$.\n\nThe area of intersection is:\n$A_I = W_{int} \\cdot H_{int} = 4.5 \\times 3 = 13.5$.\n\nThe areas of the individual boxes are:\n$A_{GT} = w \\cdot h = 6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n$A_P = \\hat{w} \\cdot \\hat{h} = 5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n\nThe area of the union is:\n$A_U = A_{GT} + A_P - A_I = 24 + 15 - 13.5 = 39 - 13.5 = 25.5$.\n\nFinally, we compute the $\\mathrm{IoU}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{A_I}{A_U} = \\frac{13.5}{25.5} = \\frac{135}{255} = \\frac{27}{51} = \\frac{9}{17}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $9/17 \\approx 0.52941176...$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5294$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5294}$$", "id": "3160509"}, {"introduction": "With a solid theoretical grasp of $\\mathrm{IoU}$, the next step is to explore its behavior in practice.

Each case involves a ground-truth bounding box and a predicted bounding box, where the latter is a translated version of the former. We begin by deriving a general formula for the IoU between two axis-aligned bounding boxes of identical dimensions, where one is shifted relative to the other.\n\nLet the ground-truth bounding box, $B_g$, be an axis-aligned rectangle centered at the origin $(0, 0)$ with width $w$ and height $h$. In Cartesian coordinates, this box spans the intervals $[-\\frac{w}{2}, \\frac{w}{2}]$ on the x-axis and $[-\\frac{h}{2}, \\frac{h}{2}]$ on the y-axis. Its area is $A_g = w \\times h$.\n\nThe predicted bounding box, $B_p$, has the same dimensions $(w, h)$ but its center is shifted to $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$.

Its area, $A_p$, is also $w \\times h$.\n\nThe Intersection over Union is defined as:\n$$ \\text{IoU} = \\frac{\\text{Area}(B_g \\cap B_p)}{\\text{Area}(B_g \\cup B_p)} $$\n\nTo compute the IoU, we must first find the area of the intersection, $A_{\\text{intersection}} = \\text{Area}(B_g \\cap B_p)$. The intersection of two axis-aligned rectangles is another axis-aligned rectangle. The width of this intersection rectangle, $w_i$, is the length of the overlapping interval on the x-axis. The overlap is the length of the intersection of $[-\\frac{w}{2}, \\frac{w}{2}]$ and $[\\Delta x - \\frac{w}{2}, \\Delta x + \\frac{w}{2}]$. The length of this intersection is given by $w_i = \\max(0, w - |\\Delta x|)$. If $|\\Delta x| \\ge w$, the boxes do not overlap in the x-dimension, and the intersection width is $0$.\n\nSimilarly, the height of the intersection rectangle, $h_i$, is the length of the overlapping interval on the y-axis, given by $h_i = \\max(0, h - |\\Delta y|)$.\n\nThe area of the intersection is the product of its width and height:\n$$ A_{\\text{intersection}} = w_i \\times h_i = \\max(0, w - |\\Delta x|) \\times \\max(0, h - |\\Delta y|) $$\n\nNext, we compute the area of the union, $A_{\\text{union}} = \\text{Area}(B_g \\cup B_p)$. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for areas, we have:\n$$ A_{\\text{union}} = \\text{Area}(B_g) + \\text{Area}(B_p) - A_{\\text{intersection}} $$\nSince both boxes have the same area $wh$, this simplifies to:\n$$ A_{\\text{union}} = wh + wh - A_{\\text{intersection}} = 2wh - A_{\\text{intersection}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_{\\text{intersection}}$ and $A_{\\text{union}}$ into the IoU definition, we obtain the general formula:\n$$ \\text{IoU} = \\frac{A_{\\text{intersection}}}{2wh - A_{\\text{intersection}}} = \\frac{\\max(0, w - |\\Delta x|) \\times \\max(0, h - |\\Delta y|)}{2wh - \\left( \\max(0, w - |\\Delta x|) \\times \\max(0, h - |\\Delta y|) \\right)} $$\nIf the intersection area is $0$, the numerator is $0$, and thus the IoU is $0$.

Let the four corresponding corners of the predicted and ground-truth boxes be\n$\\left(x_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}}, y_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)$, $\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}}, y_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)$, $\\left(x_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}}, y_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)$, $\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}}, y_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)$ and $\\left(x_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}, y_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$, $\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}}, y_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$, $\\left(x_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}, y_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$, $\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}}, y_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)$, respectively. Let the Euclidean distance between corresponding corners be averaged and normalized by the diagonal length of the ground-truth box:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{corner}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k=1}^{4} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\left(\\Delta x_{k}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\Delta y_{k}\\right)^{2}}}{\\sqrt{\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}} - x_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(y_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}} - y_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}\\right)^{2}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta x_{k}$ and $\\Delta y_{k}$ are the coordinate differences for the $k$-th corresponding corner. This yields a dimensionless, scale-normalized penalty.\n\nCombine IoU and the corner penalty into a single tie-breaking score\n$$\nS = \\mathrm{IoU} - \\alpha \\, D_{\\mathrm{corner}},\n$$\nwith a fixed weight $\\alpha = 0.5$. A higher value of $S$ is better.\n\nConstruct and evaluate a pathological case in which IoU is identical for two misaligned predictions against the same ground-truth box, and show that the auxiliary penalty breaks the tie in favor of the prediction whose corners are closer to the ground-truth corners.\n\nImplement a program that computes $\\mathrm{IoU}$, $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}$, and $S$ for the following test suite. Use a tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$ when asserting equality of floating-point values.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test case $1$ (pathological tie with different misalignment patterns):\n  - Ground truth $G_{1} = \\left[0,0,2,2\\right]$.\n  - Prediction $A_{1} = \\left[1,0,3,2\\right]$.\n  - Prediction $B_{1} = [1/2, 2/3, 5/2, 8/3]$.\n  - Both $A_{1}$ and $B_{1}$ have identical $\\mathrm{IoU}$ with $G_{1}$, but different $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}$. The result for this test is a boolean that is true if $\\left|\\mathrm{IoU}\\left(A_{1},G_{1}\\right) - \\mathrm{IoU}\\left(B_{1},G_{1}\\right)\\right| \\le \\varepsilon$ and $S\\left(B_{1},G_{1}\\right) \\gt S\\left(A_{1},G_{1}\\right)$.\n\n- Test case $2$ (boundary condition with zero overlap for both predictions):\n  - Ground truth $G_{2} = \\left[0,0,1,1\\right]$.\n  - Prediction $A_{2} = \\left[2,0,3,1\\right]$.\n  - Prediction $B_{2} = \\left[10,0,11,1\\right]$.\n  - Both $\\mathrm{IoU}$ values are $0$, but $A_{2}$ is closer in corner distance. The result is a boolean that is true if $\\left|\\mathrm{IoU}\\left(A_{2},G_{2}\\right) - \\mathrm{IoU}\\left(B_{2},G_{2}\\right)\\right| \\le \\varepsilon$ and $S\\left(A_{2},G_{2}\\right) \\gt S\\left(B_{2},G_{2}\\right)$.\n\n- Test case $3$ (happy path where $\\mathrm{IoU}$ ranking should be preserved by the auxiliary loss):\n  - Ground truth $G_{3} = \\left[0,0,2,2\\right]$.\n  - Prediction $A_{3} = \\left[0.3,0.1,2.3,2.1\\right]$.\n  - Prediction $B_{3} = \\left[0.6,0.2,2.6,2.2\\right]$.\n  - The result is a boolean that is true if $\\mathrm{IoU}\\left(A_{3},G_{3}\\right) \\gt \\mathrm{IoU}\\left(B_{3},G_{3}\\right)$ and $S\\left(A_{3},G_{3}\\right) \\gt S\\left(B_{3},G_{3}\\right)$.\n\n- Test case $4$ (edge case of perfect prediction):\n  - Ground truth $G_{4} = \\left[0,0,2,2\\right]$.\n  - Prediction $P_{4} = \\left[0,0,2,2\\right]$.\n  - The result is the scalar value of $S\\left(P_{4},G_{4}\\right)$ as a floating-point number rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, \"[r1,r2,r3,r4]\". Here $r1$, $r2$, and $r3$ are booleans as defined above, and $r4$ is the floating-point value for $S\\left(P_{4},G_{4}\\right)$ rounded to $6$ decimals.\n- No input is provided to the program; it must run with the test suite hard-coded.", "solution": "The problem requires the design and evaluation of a tie-breaking scoring function, $S$, for bounding box regression in object detection. This score combines the standard Intersection over Union ($\\mathrm{IoU}$) metric with a novel auxiliary penalty, $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}$, designed to resolve ambiguities where $\\mathrm{IoU}$ alone is insufficient. The analysis will proceed by first defining the components of the score and then systematically evaluating its behavior across a suite of specified test cases. All bounding boxes are axis-aligned and defined by their top-left $(x_1, y_1)$ and bottom-right $(x_2, y_2)$ corners.\n\nFirst, we define the Intersection over Union ($\\mathrm{IoU}$) for a predicted box $P$ and a ground-truth box $G$. The $\\mathrm{IoU}$ is the ratio of the area of their intersection to the area of their union.\nLet the predicted box be $P = [x_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}}, y_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}}, x_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}}, y_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}}]$ and the ground-truth box be $G = [x_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}, y_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}, x_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}}, y_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}}]$.\nThe area of the predicted box is $A_{\\mathrm{p}} = (x_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}} - x_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}})(y_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}} - y_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}})$ and the ground-truth area is $A_{\\mathrm{g}} = (x_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}} - x_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}})(y_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}} - y_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}})$.\nThe intersection area, $A_{\\mathrm{int}}$, is calculated from the overlap width $w_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and height $h_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\max(0, \\min(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}}, x_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}}) - \\max(x_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}}, x_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}))\n$$\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\max(0, \\min(y_{2}^{\\mathrm{p}}, y_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}}) - \\max(y_{1}^{\\mathrm{p}}, y_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}}))\n$$\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{int}} = w_{\\mathrm{int}} \\cdot h_{\\mathrm{int}}\n$$\nThe union area is $A_{\\mathrm{union}} = A_{\\mathrm{p}} + A_{\\mathrm{g}} - A_{\\mathrm{int}}$. The $\\mathrm{IoU}$ is then:\n$$\n\\mathrm{IoU}(P,G) = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{int}}}{A_{\\mathrm{union}}}\n$$\nWhile $\\mathrm{IoU}$ is a powerful metric, it can yield identical values for geometrically distinct misalignments, creating pathological cases where it cannot distinguish the better prediction.\n\nTo resolve such ties, an auxiliary corner distance penalty, $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}$, is introduced. This penalty measures the average normalized Euclidean distance between the four corresponding corners of the predicted and ground-truth boxes. The four corners of a box $[x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2]$ are $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_1)$, $(x_1, y_2)$, and $(x_2, y_2)$. The penalty is defined as:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{corner}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k=1}^{4} \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\Delta x_{k})^{2} + (\\Delta y_{k})^{2}}}{d_{\\mathrm{g}}}\n$$\nwhere $(\\Delta x_k, \\Delta y_k)$ is the vector between the $k$-th corresponding corners of the predicted and ground-truth boxes, and $d_{\\mathrm{g}}$ is the length of the diagonal of the ground-truth box, $d_{\\mathrm{g}} = \\sqrt{(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}} - x_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}})^2 + (y_{2}^{\\mathrm{g}} - y_{1}^{\\mathrm{g}})^2}$. Normalization by $d_{\\mathrm{g}}$ ensures the penalty is a dimensionless, scale-invariant quantity. A smaller $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}$ value indicates a better geometric alignment of the corners.\n\nThe final tie-breaking score, $S$, combines $\\mathrm{IoU}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}$:\n$$\nS(P,G) = \\mathrm{IoU}(P,G) - \\alpha \\, D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(P,G)\n$$\nwith the weight $\\alpha$ given as $0.5$. This score prioritizes maximizing $\\mathrm{IoU}$ while using the corner distance as a penalty term. A higher score $S$ indicates a better prediction.\n\nWe now evaluate $S$ on the provided test suite.\n\n**Test Case 1: Pathological Tie**\n- Ground Truth $G_1 = [0, 0, 2, 2]$\n- Prediction $A_1 = [1, 0, 3, 2]$\n- Prediction $B_1 = [1/2, 2/3, 5/2, 8/3]$\nFor $(A_1, G_1)$: $A_{\\mathrm{g}} = 4$, $A_{\\mathrm{p}} = 4$. Intersection is $[1, 0, 2, 2]$, so $A_{\\mathrm{int}} = 2$. $\\mathrm{IoU}(A_1, G_1) = \\frac{2}{4+4-2} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nFor $(B_1, G_1)$: $A_{\\mathrm{g}} = 4$, $A_{\\mathrm{p}} = (5/2 - 1/2)(8/3 - 2/3) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$. Intersection is $[1/2, 2/3, 2, 2]$, so $A_{\\mathrm{int}} = (2 - 1/2)(2 - 2/3) = (3/2)(4/3) = 2$. $\\mathrm{IoU}(B_1, G_1) = \\frac{2}{4+4-2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe condition $|\\mathrm{IoU}(A_1, G_1) - \\mathrm{IoU}(B_1, G_1)| \\le \\varepsilon$ is satisfied, as the difference is exactly $0$.\nNow we compute $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}$ for both. The diagonal of $G_1$ is $d_{\\mathrm{g}} = \\sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $A_1$, the displacement for all four corners is $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) = (1, 0)$, so the distance is $1$. Thus, $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(A_1, G_1) = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{1+1+1+1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{4}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.\nFor $B_1$, the corner displacements are $(\\pm 1/2, \\pm 2/3)$, leading to a distance of $\\sqrt{(1/2)^2 + (2/3)^2} = \\sqrt{1/4 + 4/9} = \\sqrt{25/36} = 5/6$ for each corner. Thus, $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(B_1, G_1) = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{4 \\cdot (5/6)}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5/6}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5}{12\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{24}$.\nComparing penalties: $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{24} > \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{24}$. So $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(A_1, G_1) > D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(B_1, G_1)$.\nThis implies $S(A_1, G_1) < S(B_1, G_1)$. The condition $S(B_1, G_1) > S(A_1, G_1)$ holds. The final result for this test case is true.\n\n**Test Case 2: Zero Overlap**\n- Ground Truth $G_2 = [0, 0, 1, 1]$\n- Prediction $A_2 = [2, 0, 3, 1]$\n- Prediction $B_2 = [10, 0, 11, 1]$\nFor both $(A_2, G_2)$ and $(B_2, G_2)$, the boxes are disjoint, so $A_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0$. $\\mathrm{IoU}(A_2, G_2) = 0$ and $\\mathrm{IoU}(B_2, G_2) = 0$. The first condition $|\\mathrm{IoU}(A_2, G_2) - \\mathrm{IoU}(B_2, G_2)| \\le \\varepsilon$ is met.\nThe diagonal of $G_2$ is $d_{\\mathrm{g}} = \\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $A_2$, the corner displacements are all $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) = (2, 0)$, so the distance is $2$. $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(A_2, G_2) = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{4 \\cdot 2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $B_2$, the corner displacements are all $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) = (10, 0)$, so the distance is $10$. $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(B_2, G_2) = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{4 \\cdot 10}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = 5\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\mathrm{IoU}$ is $0$ for both, $S(P,G) = -\\alpha D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(P,G)$. As $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(A_2, G_2) < D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(B_2, G_2)$, it follows that $S(A_2, G_2) > S(B_2, G_2)$. The condition holds. The final result is true.\n\n**Test Case 3: Preserving IoU Ranking**\n- Ground Truth $G_3 = [0, 0, 2, 2]$\n- Prediction $A_3 = [0.3, 0.1, 2.3, 2.1]$\n- Prediction $B_3 = [0.6, 0.2, 2.6, 2.2]$\nFor $(A_3, G_3)$: $A_{\\mathrm{g}} = 4$, $A_{\\mathrm{p}}=4$. Intersection is $[0.3, 0.1, 2, 2]$, so $A_{\\mathrm{int}} = (2-0.3)(2-0.1) = 1.7 \\cdot 1.9 = 3.23$. $\\mathrm{IoU}(A_3, G_3) = \\frac{3.23}{4+4-3.23} = \\frac{3.23}{4.77} \\approx 0.67715$.\nFor $(B_3, G_3)$: $A_{\\mathrm{g}} = 4$, $A_{\\mathrm{p}}=4$. Intersection is $[0.6, 0.2, 2, 2]$, so $A_{\\mathrm{int}} = (2-0.6)(2-0.2) = 1.4 \\cdot 1.8 = 2.52$. $\\mathrm{IoU}(B_3, G_3) = \\frac{2.52}{4+4-2.52} = \\frac{2.52}{5.48} \\approx 0.45985$.\nClearly $\\mathrm{IoU}(A_3, G_3) > \\mathrm{IoU}(B_3, G_3)$. The first part of the condition holds.\nThe diagonal of $G_3$ is $d_{\\mathrm{g}} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $A_3$, the corner displacements are $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) = (0.3, 0.1)$. Distance is $\\sqrt{0.3^2+0.1^2} = \\sqrt{0.1}$. $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(A_3, G_3) = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{4\\sqrt{0.1}}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.1}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.1118$.\nFor $B_3$, the corner displacements are $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) = (0.6, 0.2)$. Distance is $\\sqrt{0.6^2+0.2^2} = \\sqrt{0.4}$. $D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(B_3, G_3) = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{4\\sqrt{0.4}}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.4}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.2236$.\nNow we compute the scores:\n$S(A_3, G_3) \\approx 0.67715 - 0.5 \\cdot 0.1118 \\approx 0.62125$.\n$S(B_3, G_3) \\approx 0.45985 - 0.5 \\cdot 0.2236 \\approx 0.34805$.\n$S(A_3, G_3) > S(B_3, G_3)$, so the second part of the condition also holds. The final result is true.\n\n**Test Case 4: Perfect Prediction**\n- Ground Truth $G_4 = [0, 0, 2, 2]$\n- Prediction $P_4 = [0, 0, 2, 2]$\nThe prediction is identical to the ground truth.\n$\\mathrm{IoU}(P_4, G_4) = 1$, as $A_{\\mathrm{int}} = A_{\\mathrm{p}} = A_{\\mathrm{g}} = 4$.\n$D_{\\mathrm{corner}}(P_4, G_4) = 0$, as all corner displacements $(\\Delta x_k, \\Delta y_k)$ are $(0, 0)$.\nThe score is $S(P_4, G_4) = 1 - 0.5 \\cdot 0 = 1$. Rounded to $6$ decimal places, this is $1.000000$.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the designed score $S$ successfully addresses the limitations of $\\mathrm{IoU}$ in the pathological test cases while behaving coherently in standard scenarios.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by implementing and evaluating a tie-breaking\n    score for bounding box regression.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_metrics(p_box, g_box, alpha):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates IoU, D_corner, and the combined score S.\n\n        Args:\n            p_box (np.ndarray): Predicted box [x1, y1, x2, y2].\n            g_box (np.ndarray): Ground-truth box [x1, y1, x2, y2].\n            alpha (float): Weight for the corner penalty.\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple: A tuple containing (iou, d_corner, s_score).\n        \"\"\"\n        x1p, y1p, x2p, y2p = p_box\n        x1g, y1g, x2g, y2g = g_box\n\n        # Calculate IoU\n        x1_int = max(x1p, x1g)\n        y1_int = max(y1p, y1g)\n        x2_int = min(x2p, x2g)\n        y2_int = min(y2p, y2g)\n\n        w_int = max(0, x2_int - x1_int)\n        h_int = max(0, y2_int - y1_int)\n        A_int = w_int * h_int\n\n        A_p = (x2p - x1p) * (y2p - y1p)\n        A_g = (x2g - x1g) * (y2g - y1g)\n\n        A_union = A_p + A_g - A_int\n        iou = A_int / A_union if A_union > 1e-9 else 0.0\n\n        # Calculate D_corner\n        p_corners = np.array([\n            [x1p, y1p], [x2p, y1p], [x1p, y2p], [x2p, y2p]\n        ])\n        g_corners = np.array([\n            [x1g, y1g], [x2g, y1g], [x1g, y2g], [x2g, y2g]\n        ])\n\n        w_g = x2g - x1g\n        h_g = y2g - y1g\n        diag_g = np.sqrt(w_g**2 + h_g**2)\n\n        if diag_g < 1e-9:\n            d_corner = 0.0\n        else:\n            corner_dists = np.sqrt(np.sum((p_corners - g_corners)**2, axis=1))\n            total_dist = np.sum(corner_dists)\n            d_corner = (1/4) * (total_dist / diag_g)\n\n        # Calculate S\n        s_score = iou - alpha * d_corner\n\n        return iou, d_corner, s_score\n\n    # Define test parameters\n    alpha = 0.5\n    epsilon = 1e-9\n    results = []\n    \n    # Test case 1\n    G1 = np.array([0., 0., 2., 2.])\n    A1 = np.array([1., 0., 3., 2.])\n    B1 = np.array([1/2, 2/3, 5/2, 8/3])\n    iou_a1, _, s_a1 = calculate_metrics(A1, G1, alpha)\n    iou_b1, _, s_b1 = calculate_metrics(B1, G1, alpha)\n    result1 = abs(iou_a1 - iou_b1) <= epsilon and s_b1 > s_a1\n    results.append(result1)\n\n    # Test case 2\n    G2 = np.array([0., 0., 1., 1.])\n    A2 = np.array([2., 0., 3., 1.])\n    B2 = np.array([10., 0., 11., 1.])\n    iou_a2, _, s_a2 = calculate_metrics(A2, G2, alpha)\n    iou_b2, _, s_b2 = calculate_metrics(B2, G2, alpha)\n    result2 = abs(iou_a2 - iou_b2) <= epsilon and s_a2 > s_b2\n    results.append(result2)\n\n    # Test case 3\n    G3 = np.array([0., 0., 2., 2.])\n    A3 = np.array([0.3, 0.1, 2.3, 2.1])\n    B3 = np.array([0.6, 0.2, 2.6, 2.2])\n    iou_a3, _, s_a3 = calculate_metrics(A3, G3, alpha)\n    iou_b3, _, s_b3 = calculate_metrics(B3, G3, alpha)\n    result3 = iou_a3 > iou_b3 and s_a3 > s_b3\n    results.append(result3)\n    \n    # Test case 4\n    G4 = np.array([0., 0., 2., 2.])\n    P4 = np.array([0., 0., 2., 2.])\n    _, _, s_p4 = calculate_metrics(P4, G4, alpha)\n    result4 = f\"{s_p4:.6f}\"\n    results.append(result4)\n\n    # Final print statement\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3160496"}]}
