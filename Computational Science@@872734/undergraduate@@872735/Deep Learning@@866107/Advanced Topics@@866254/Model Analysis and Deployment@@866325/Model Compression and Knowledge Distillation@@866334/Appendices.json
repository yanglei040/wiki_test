Energy of the Teacher Model ($E_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}}$)**\nFor the teacher model operating at $32$-bit precision (fp32), the givens are:\n- $\\mathrm{FLOPs}_{\\mathrm{teacher}} = 3.2 \\times 10^9$\n- $\\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}} = 1.25 \\times 10^8$ bytes\n- $a_{\\mathrm{fp32}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-12}$ J/op\n- $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}$ J/byte\n\nThe total energy for the teacher model is the sum of the compute energy and memory energy:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}} = a_{\\mathrm{fp32}} \\cdot \\mathrm{FLOPs}_{\\mathrm{teacher}} + b \\cdot \\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (3.2 \\times 10^9) + (2.5 \\times 10^{-10}) \\cdot (1.25 \\times 10^8) $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}} = 6.4 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{J} + 3.125 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{J} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}} = 0.0064 \\, \\mathrm{J} + 0.03125 \\, \\mathrm{J} = 0.03765 \\, \\mathrm{J} $$\n\n**2. Parameters and Energy of the Student Model ($E_{\\mathrm{student,int8}}$)**\nThe student model's parameters are derived from the teacher's.\nFirst, the effects of pruning and knowledge distillation reduce the operation count and memory traffic structurally.\n- $\\mathrm{FLOPs}_{\\mathrm{student}} = 0.40 \\cdot \\mathrm{FLOPs}_{\\mathrm{teacher}} = 0.40 \\cdot (3.2 \\times 10^9) = 1.28 \\times 10^9$ operations.\n\nSecond, the memory traffic is affected by both structural pruning and quantization. The pruning reduces the memory traffic (number of parameters/activations accessed) to $30\\%$ of the teacher's, measured at the same precision. Let's denote the memory traffic of a hypothetical 32-bit student model as $\\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{student,fp32}}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{student,fp32}} = 0.30 \\cdot \\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}} = 0.30 \\cdot (1.25 \\times 10^8) = 3.75 \\times 10^7 \\, \\mathrm{bytes} $$\nNext, quantization from $32$-bit to $8$-bit reduces the data size for each accessed element by a factor of $\\frac{32}{8} = 4$. Therefore, the final memory traffic for the $8$-bit student model, $\\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{student,int8}}$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{student,int8}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{student,fp32}}}{4} = \\frac{3.75 \\times 10^7}{4} = 9.375 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{bytes} $$\n\nThe energy coefficients for the int8 student model are:\n- $a_{\\mathrm{int8}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-13}$ J/op\n- $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}$ J/byte (unchanged)\n\nThe total energy for the student model is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{student,int8}} = a_{\\mathrm{int8}} \\cdot \\mathrm{FLOPs}_{\\mathrm{student}} + b \\cdot \\mathrm{Mem}_{\\mathrm{student,int8}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{student,int8}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-13}) \\cdot (1.28 \\times 10^9) + (2.5 \\times 10^{-10}) \\cdot (9.375 \\times 10^6) $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{student,int8}} = 6.4 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{J} + 2.34375 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{J} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{student,int8}} = 0.00064 \\, \\mathrm{J} + 0.00234375 \\, \\mathrm{J} = 0.00298375 \\, \\mathrm{J} $$\n\n**3. Fractional Energy Savings (S)**\nThe fractional energy savings $S$ is defined as:\n$$ S = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}} - E_{\\mathrm{student,int8}}}{E_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}}} = 1 - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{student,int8}}}{E_{\\mathrm{teacher,fp32}}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated energy values:\n$$ S = 1 - \\frac{0.00298375}{0.03765} $$\n$$ S = 1 - 0.079249667... $$\n$$ S = 0.920750332... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required gives:\n$$ S \\approx 0.9208 $$\nThis represents a $92.08\\%$ reduction in energy consumption per inference.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9208}\n$$", "id": "3152867"}, {"introduction": "While techniques like quantization are powerful, their successful implementation hinges on understanding subtle but critical details.

In this model, its time is $T_{\\text{dense}} = \\alpha \\cdot m n$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant that aggregates per-operation cost and memory effects for dense compute.\n\n- Sparse compute model: For a weight matrix with $s$ nonzero entries, actual sparse time is modeled as\n$$\nT_{\\text{sparse}} = \\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot B,\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the cost per nonzero arithmetic operation in sparse mode, $\\gamma$ is the overhead per processed structural unit, and $B$ is the number of processed structural units determined by the sparsity pattern:\n    - Unstructured pruning: Each nonzero is a unit; $B = s$.\n    - Block pruning with block size $b \\times b$: Each kept block is a unit; $B$ equals the number of kept blocks (assume blocks are either fully kept or fully pruned).\n    - Row pruning: Each kept row is a unit; $B$ equals the number of kept rows.\n    - Column pruning: Each kept column is a unit; $B$ equals the number of kept columns.\n\n- Ideal theoretical time ignoring overheads is\n$$\nT_{\\text{ideal}} = \\beta \\cdot s,\n$$\nwhich yields a theoretical speedup from sparsity alone.\n\nSparsity patterns and mask construction rules:\n\n- Unstructured pruning with target sparsity $p$: Select exactly $\\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot m n \\rfloor$ entries uniformly at random to keep as nonzero; all others are zero.\n\n- Block pruning with target sparsity $p$ and block size $b \\times b$: Partition $W$ into $\\lfloor m / b \\rfloor \\times \\lfloor n / b \\rfloor$ non-overlapping blocks of size $b \\times b$ (ignore any remainder if $m$ or $n$ are not multiples of $b$). Keep exactly $\\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot \\lfloor m / b \\rfloor \\cdot \\lfloor n / b \\rfloor \\rfloor$ blocks chosen uniformly at random; all entries within kept blocks are nonzero; all entries within pruned blocks are zero.\n\n- Row pruning with target sparsity $p$: Keep exactly $\\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot m \\rfloor$ rows chosen uniformly at random, with all entries in kept rows nonzero and all entries in pruned rows zero.\n\n- Column pruning with target sparsity $p$: Keep exactly $\\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot n \\rfloor$ columns chosen uniformly at random, with all entries in kept columns nonzero and all entries in pruned rows zero.\n\nSpeedup definitions to compute:\n\n- Theoretical speedup:\n$$\n\\text{speedup}_{\\text{theory}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{dense}}}{T_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot m n}{\\beta \\cdot s}.\n$$\n\n- Actual speedup under the hardware model:\n$$\n\\text{speedup}_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{dense}}}{T_{\\text{sparse}}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot m n}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot B}.\n$$\n\n- Realized efficiency ratio comparing actual speed gains to theoretical sparsity gains:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\text{speedup}_{\\text{actual}}}{\\text{speedup}_{\\text{theory}}}.\n$$\n\nConstants for the execution model (use these exact values):\n- $\\alpha = 1.0$,\n- $\\beta = 1.2$,\n- $\\gamma = 5.0$.\n\nRandomness requirement: Use a fixed random seed of $42$ to ensure reproducibility of mask construction.\n\nTest suite (five cases that probe different facets of sparsity and structure):\n\n1. $m = 512$, $n = 512$, $p = 0.9$, unstructured pruning, $b$ not applicable.\n2. $m = 512$, $n = 512$, $p = 0.9$, block pruning with $b = 4$.\n3. $m = 512$, $n = 512$, $p = 0.9$, row pruning, $b$ not applicable.\n4. $m = 1024$, $n = 256$, $p = 0.5$, column pruning, $b$ not applicable.\n5. $m = 256$, $n = 256$, $p = 0.5$, unstructured pruning, $b$ not applicable.\n\nYour program must:\n- Construct the nonzero mask for each case following the rules above.\n- Compute $s$, $B$, $T_{\\text{dense}}$, $T_{\\text{ideal}}$, $T_{\\text{sparse}}$, $\\text{speedup}_{\\text{theory}}$, $\\text{speedup}_{\\text{actual}}$, and $\\rho$ for each case.\n- Produce a single line of output containing the realized efficiency ratios $\\rho$ for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[\\rho_1,\\rho_2,\\rho_3,\\rho_4,\\rho_5]$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational cost modeling for sparse matrix operations in neural networks, well-posed with all necessary definitions and constants, and objectively formulated. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the realized efficiency ratio, $\\rho$, for five different scenarios of weight matrix pruning. This ratio compares the actual speedup achieved on hypothetical hardware to the theoretical speedup expected from merely reducing the number of non-zero parameters. The formula for $\\rho$ is given by:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\text{speedup}_{\\text{actual}}}{\\text{speedup}_{\\text{theory}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions for speedup provides a more direct formula for computation.\n$$\n\\text{speedup}_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{dense}}}{T_{\\text{sparse}}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot m n}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot B}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{speedup}_{\\text{theory}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{dense}}}{T_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot m n}{\\beta \\cdot s}\n$$\nWhere $s$ is the number of non-zero entries, $B$ is the number of processed structural units, $m$ and $n$ are matrix dimensions, and $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ are cost constants.\n\nThe ratio $\\rho$ can be simplified as:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha \\cdot m n}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot B}}{\\frac{\\alpha \\cdot m n}{\\beta \\cdot s}} = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot s}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot B} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma \\cdot B}{\\beta \\cdot s}}\n$$\nThis simplified form reveals that the realized efficiency is determined by the ratio of the structural overhead cost ($\\gamma \\cdot B$) to the arithmetic cost ($\\beta \\cdot s$). We will use the provided constants $\\beta = 1.2$ and $\\gamma = 5.0$. The problem specifies rules for determining $s$ and $B$ for each pruning type, which are deterministic calculations based on the given parameters. The requirement for a random seed is noted, but since the quantities $s$ and $B$ are defined by deterministic formulas based on counts, the specific random choices do not alter the final value of $\\rho$.\n\nWe will now compute $\\rho$ for each test case.\n\n**Case 1: Unstructured Pruning**\n- Parameters: $m = 512$, $n = 512$, target sparsity $p = 0.9$.\n- The total number of entries in the matrix is $m \\cdot n = 512 \\cdot 512 = 262144$.\n- The number of non-zero entries to keep is $s = \\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot m n \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 - 0.9) \\cdot 262144 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 26214.4 \\rfloor = 26214$.\n- For unstructured pruning, each non-zero entry is a structural unit, so $B = s = 26214$.\n- The efficiency ratio $\\rho_1$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_1 = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot s}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot s} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta + \\gamma} = \\frac{1.2}{1.2 + 5.0} = \\frac{1.2}{6.2} \\approx 0.193548\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Block Pruning**\n- Parameters: $m = 512$, $n = 512$, $p = 0.9$, block size $b=4$.\n- The matrix is partitioned into non-overlapping blocks of size $4 \\times 4$.\n- Number of blocks: $(\\lfloor 512/4 \\rfloor) \\times (\\lfloor 512/4 \\rfloor) = 128 \\times 128 = 16384$.\n- The number of blocks to keep is the number of structural units: $B = \\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot 16384 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 0.1 \\cdot 16384 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1638.4 \\rfloor = 1638$.\n- The total number of non-zero entries is $s = B \\cdot b^2 = 1638 \\cdot 4^2 = 1638 \\cdot 16 = 26208$.\n- The efficiency ratio $\\rho_2$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_2 = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot s}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot B} = \\frac{1.2 \\cdot 26208}{1.2 \\cdot 26208 + 5.0 \\cdot 1638} = \\frac{31449.6}{31449.6 + 8190} = \\frac{31449.6}{39639.6} \\approx 0.793388\n$$\n\n**Case 3: Row Pruning**\n- Parameters: $m = 512$, $n = 512$, $p = 0.9$.\n- The number of rows to keep is the number of structural units: $B = \\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot m \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 - 0.9) \\cdot 512 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 51.2 \\rfloor = 51$.\n- The total number of non-zero entries is $s = B \\cdot n = 51 \\cdot 512 = 26112$.\n- The efficiency ratio $\\rho_3$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_3 = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot s}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot B} = \\frac{1.2 \\cdot 26112}{1.2 \\cdot 26112 + 5.0 \\cdot 51} = \\frac{31334.4}{31334.4 + 255} = \\frac{31334.4}{31589.4} \\approx 0.991928\n$$\n\n**Case 4: Column Pruning**\n- Parameters: $m = 1024$, $n = 256$, $p = 0.5$.\n- The number of columns to keep is the number of structural units: $B = \\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot n \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 - 0.5) \\cdot 256 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 128 \\rfloor = 128$.\n- The total number of non-zero entries is $s = B \\cdot m = 128 \\cdot 1024 = 131072$.\n- The efficiency ratio $\\rho_4$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_4 = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot s}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot B} = \\frac{1.2 \\cdot 131072}{1.2 \\cdot 131072 + 5.0 \\cdot 128} = \\frac{157286.4}{157286.4 + 640} = \\frac{157286.4}{157926.4} \\approx 0.995947\n$$\n\n**Case 5: Unstructured Pruning**\n- Parameters: $m = 256$, $n = 256$, $p = 0.5$.\n- The total number of entries is $m \\cdot n = 256 \\cdot 256 = 65536$.\n- The number of non-zero entries to keep is $s = \\lfloor (1 - p) \\cdot m n \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 - 0.5) \\cdot 65536 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 32768 \\rfloor = 32768$.\n- For unstructured pruning, $B = s = 32768$.\n- The efficiency ratio $\\rho_5$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_5 = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot s}{\\beta \\cdot s + \\gamma \\cdot s} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta + \\gamma} = \\frac{1.2}{1.2 + 5.0} = \\frac{1.2}{6.2} \\approx 0.193548\n$$\nThese calculations demonstrate that structured pruning methods (block, row, column) are significantly more efficient as they greatly reduce the overhead term $\\gamma B$ relative to the arithmetic term $\\beta s$, resulting in $\\rho$ values close to $1$.
