The model is $f(x; w_1, w_2) = \\sigma(w_1 x) + w_2$ with $\\sigma(z) = \\max(0, z)$, and the empirical loss is $J(w_1, w_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(\\sigma(w_1 x_i) + w_2 - y_i\\right)^{2}$. The dataset is $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)$, $(x_2, y_2) = (3, 1)$, and $(x_3, y_3) = (5, 4)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the qualitative shape.\n\n1. Kinks: The function $\\sigma(z)$ is non-differentiable at $z = 0$. In our parameterization, the argument is $z_i(w_1) = w_1 x_i$. Since $x_i  0$ for all $i$, the locus $w_1 = 0$ induces $z_i(0) = 0$ simultaneously for all $i$. Therefore, $J(w_1, w_2)$ has a kink at $w_1 = 0$ for any fixed $w_2$, because the composition through $\\sigma$ changes its form at this boundary.\n\n2. Plateaus and dead neurons: For $w_1 \\leq 0$ and $x_i  0$, we have $w_1 x_i \\leq 0$ and thus $\\sigma(w_1 x_i) = 0$ for all $i$. In that region, the neuron is “dead” on the dataset, and the model reduces to $f(x_i; w_1, w_2) = w_2$. Consequently, $J(w_1, w_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (w_2 - y_i)^{2}$ becomes independent of $w_1$. This implies a plateau in the $w_1$ direction for all $w_1 \\leq 0$: the loss is flat with respect to changes in $w_1$ in that half-space.\n\n3. Saddle-like behavior near $w_1 = 0$: Although $J$ is flat in $w_1$ for $w_1 \\leq 0$, the behavior for $w_1  0$ can decrease the loss if the data admits a better fit via the active neuron contribution $\\sigma(w_1 x_i) = w_1 x_i$. Thus, at the boundary $w_1 = 0$, the loss can be flat in one direction (non-increasing for $w_1 \\leq 0$) while descending in another direction ($w_1  0$), which is characteristic of a saddle-like region in the loss landscape.\n\nWe next compute the Clarke subdifferential of $J$ with respect to $w_1$ at $w_1 = 0$ for a fixed $w_2$. For nonsmooth analysis, recall that at $z = 0$ the Clarke subdifferential of $\\sigma$ is the interval $\\partial \\sigma(0) = [0, 1]$. For each data point, define the residuals at $(w_1, w_2) = (0, w_2)$ as $\\Delta_i(w_2) = w_2 - y_i$, since $\\sigma(0) = 0$. A single summand is $g_i(w_1, w_2) = \\left(\\sigma(w_1 x_i) + w_2 - y_i\\right)^{2}$. Its generalized derivative with respect to $w_1$ at $w_1 = 0$ can be obtained by a chain rule for Clarke subdifferentials: an element of $\\partial_{w_1} g_i(0, w_2)$ is $2 \\left(\\sigma(0) + w_2 - y_i\\right) \\cdot v_i x_i$ with $v_i \\in [0, 1]$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\partial_{w_1} g_i(0, w_2) = \\left\\{ 2 \\Delta_i(w_2) \\, v_i \\, x_i \\, : \\, v_i \\in [0, 1] \\right\\}.\n$$\nSumming over $i = 1, 2, 3$ yields\n$$\n\\partial_{w_1} J(0, w_2) = \\left\\{ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Delta_i(w_2) \\, v_i \\, x_i \\, : \\, v_i \\in [0, 1] \\right\\}.\n$$\nLet $a_i(w_2) = \\Delta_i(w_2) x_i = (w_2 - y_i) x_i$. Then the set above is\n$$\n\\left\\{ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i(w_2) v_i \\, : \\, v_i \\in [0, 1] \\right\\}.\n$$\nBecause the $v_i$ range independently over $[0, 1]$, the set of sums $\\sum_{i} a_i v_i$ is the interval\n$$\n\\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\min\\{a_i(w_2), 0\\} \\,,\\, \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\max\\{a_i(w_2), 0\\} \\right],\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\partial_{w_1} J(0, w_2) = 2 \\cdot \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\min\\{a_i(w_2), 0\\} \\,,\\, \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\max\\{a_i(w_2), 0\\} \\right].\n$$\n\nWe now find $w_2^{\\star}$ minimizing $J(0, w_2)$. On the plateau $w_1 \\leq 0$, the loss is $J(0, w_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (w_2 - y_i)^{2}$, which is a convex quadratic in $w_2$.

This criterion must be able to distinguish between true local minima and saddle points or flat regions where the gradient is small, a common challenge in deep learning optimization.\n\nFirst, we derive the stopping criterion from fundamental principles. Let $L(\\mathbf{w})$ be a smooth, twice-differentiable loss function, where $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the parameter vector. The second-order Taylor expansion of $L$ around a point $\\mathbf{w}_k$ is given by:\n$$\nL(\\mathbf{w}_k + \\mathbf{p}) \\approx M_k(\\mathbf{p}) = L(\\mathbf{w}_k) + \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)^T \\mathbf{p} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{p}^T H_k \\mathbf{p}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{p}$ is a step vector, $\\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)$ is the gradient of $L$ at $\\mathbf{w}_k$, and $H_k = \\nabla^2 L(\\mathbf{w}_k)$ is the Hessian matrix at $\\mathbf{w}_k$. $M_k(\\mathbf{p})$ is a quadratic model of the loss function in the neighborhood of $\\mathbf{w}_k$.\n\nA standard second-order optimization method, such as Newton's method, seeks to find the step $\\mathbf{p}$ that minimizes this quadratic model.

The paths are defined by a quadratic Bézier curve:\n$$\nw(\\alpha) = (1-\\alpha)^2 w_A + 2(1-\\alpha)\\alpha \\, c + \\alpha^2 w_B, \\quad \\alpha \\in [0,1]\n$$\nThis curve provides a smooth path from $w(0) = w_A$ to $w(1) = w_B$. The shape of the path is governed by the control point $c = (c_x, c_y)$. For $c = (0,0)$, the path is a straight line segment between $w_A$ and $w_B$. For $c$ with $c_y \\neq 0$, the path is a parabola that curves into the $w_2$ dimension, away from the direct line.\n\nThe loss barrier is defined as the maximum loss encountered along the path, minus the loss at the more favorable of the two endpoints:\n$$\n\\text{Barrier} = \\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]} L(w(\\alpha)) \\;-\\; \\max\\left(L(w_A), \\, L(w_B)\\right)\n$$\nWe compute this barrier numerically by discretizing the path. We evaluate $w(\\alpha)$ and $L(w(\\alpha))$ for $N$ uniformly spaced values of $\\alpha$ in $[0,1]$ and find the maximum loss among these samples.\n\nFor all test cases, the parameters are set such that $r_0 = 1.0$. The anchor points $w_A = (-1, 0)$ and $w_B = (1, 0)$ both have a radius of $\\sqrt{(\\pm 1)^2 + 0^2} = 1$. Consequently, they lie exactly at the center of the low-loss valley created by $R(w)$. The loss at these endpoints is:\n$P(w_{A,B}) = 0$\n$R(w_{A,B}; A, 1, s) = -A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1 - 1)^2}{2 s^2}\\right) = -A \\exp(0) = -A$\nThus, $L(w_A) = L(w_B) = -A$. The barrier formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Barrier} = \\left( \\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]} L(w(\\alpha)) \\right) - (-A) = \\left( \\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]} L(w(\\alpha)) \\right) + A\n$$\n\nThe provided test cases explore how the barrier changes with the control point $c$.\n- **Case 1**: $c=(0,0)$. The path is a straight line $w(\\alpha) = (2\\alpha-1, 0)$. This path crosses the origin, where $P(w)$ has a local maximum. This is expected to create a significant barrier.\n- **Cases 2  3**: $c=(0, 1.5)$ and $c=(0, 3.0)$. The path becomes a parabola bending \"upwards\". This avoids the origin but moves through regions where $w_2 \\neq 0$. The term $P(w) = ((w_1^2+w_2^2)+1)^2 - 4w_1^2$ generally increases as $|w_2|$ increases (for fixed $w_1$). While curving the path might keep its radius closer to the optimal $r_0=1$, the penalty from the $P(w)$ term can be substantial. Our calculations will reveal which effect dominates.\n- **Case 4**: Uses a different parameter set with a stronger, narrower valley ($A=5.0, s=0.15$) and a control point $c=(0, 1.0)$ that defines a moderately curved path.\n\nThe existence of a low-loss connecting path (mode connectivity) would be indicated by a significantly lower barrier for a curved path (e.g., Case 2) compared to the straight-line path (Case 1). Conversely, if the barrier increases, it suggests that within this family of parabolic paths, the straight line is the most efficient, and a true low-loss \"valley\" does not lie in the direction of these simple curves. The numerical results show that for this specific landscape, increasing the curvature via $c_y$ increases the barrier, suggesting that the barrier of the polynomial term $P(w)$ away from the $w_1$-axis is the dominant factor.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each test case $(A, r_0, s, c_x, c_y, N)$, define the vectors $w_A, w_B, c$.\n2. Calculate the baseline endpoint loss, $L_{endpoints\\_max} = -A$.\n3. Generate an array of $N$ values for $\\alpha$ from $0$ to $1$.\n4. For each $\\alpha$, calculate the corresponding path point $w(\\alpha)$ using the vector-valued Bézier formula. This can be done efficiently for all $\\alpha$ values at once using numpy broadcasting.\n5. Calculate the loss $L(w(\\alpha))$ for all points on the path. This can also be fully vectorized.\n6. Find the maximum value in the resulting array of losses, $L_{max\\_path}$.\n7. Compute the barrier as $L_{max\\_path} - L_{endpoints\\_max}$.\n8.
