If multiple distances are exactly equal, break ties by choosing the smallest index in order of appearance of the training images.\n\nYour task is to implement a complete program that:\n- Constructs synthetic facial-image datasets with $m$ pixels per image and a specified number of identities. For each identity $i$, define a base face vector $b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that the dataset is scientifically plausible and linearly separable under low noise.

Partition the $m$ coordinates into $C$ contiguous blocks of equal length $m/C = 20$. For identity $i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$, set $b_i$ to have ones on its block and zeros elsewhere.

Your program should produce a single line of output containing the four integers corresponding to Cases $1$ through $4$ in order, formatted exactly as:\n$[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4]$,\nwhere $r_i$ is the number of correctly recognized test images in Case $i$.", "solution": "The user-provided problem statement has been meticulously validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a complete and self-contained task in numerical linear algebra and pattern recognition, specifically the application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to facial recognition, a method commonly known as \"eigenfaces.\" All parameters, definitions, and procedures are specified with sufficient clarity to permit a unique and verifiable solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing the described algorithm step-by-step for each of the four specified test cases. A fixed pseudo-random seed is utilized to ensure the deterministic generation of synthetic data, making the results reproducible.\n\n### Step 1: Synthetic Data Generation\n\nFor each test case, we first generate a training set and a test set of synthetic images. The problem specifies $m=60$ pixels per image, $C=3$ distinct identities, $n_{\\text{train}}=5$ training images per identity, and $n_{\\text{test}}=3$ test images per identity. This results in a total of $n = C \\times n_{\\text{train}} = 3 \\times 5 = 15$ training images and $C \\times n_{\\text{test}} = 3 \\times 3 = 9$ test images.\n\nThe base vectors for the identities, $b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, are constructed as follows:\n- **Non-degenerate case**: The $m=60$ pixel coordinates are partitioned into $C=3$ contiguous, non-overlapping blocks of size $m/C = 20$. The base vector $b_i$ is defined to have a value of $1$ for all coordinates within the $i$-th block and $0$ elsewhere. These three vectors, $b_0, b_1, b_2$, are mutually orthogonal.\n- **Degenerate case**: All identities share the same base vector, which is set to be $b_0$ from the non-degenerate case. That is, $b_0 = b_1 = b_2$.\n\nTraining and test images are generated by taking the appropriate base vector $b_i$ for a given identity and adding a vector of independent random values sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. A fixed seed for the pseudo-random number generator ensures that the same noise is generated for each run.\n\nThe training images are organized as columns of a data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{60 \\times 15}$, and their corresponding identity labels (e.g., $0, 1, 2$) are stored. Similarly, the $9$ test images and their labels are stored separately.\n\n### Step 2: Mean Centering and SVD\n\nThe core of the eigenface method lies in performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training data. This is achieved by computing the SVD of the mean-centered data matrix.\n\nFirst, the empirical mean of the training images, $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^{60}$, is calculated:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j\n$$\nwhere $x_j$ are the columns of the training data matrix $X$.\n\nNext, each training image is centered by subtracting the mean, forming the centered data matrix $X_c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{60 \\times 15}$:\n$$\nX_c = X - \\mu \\mathbf{1}^T\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{15}$ is a column vector of ones.\n\nThe SVD of $X_c$ is then computed. Since $m  n$, we use an \"economy\" SVD for efficiency:\n$$\nX_c = U \\Sigma V^T\n$$\nHere, $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{60 \\times 15}$ is the matrix of left singular vectors (the eigenfaces), $\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{15 \\times 15}$ is a diagonal matrix of singular values, and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{15 \\times 15}$ is the matrix of right singular vectors. The columns of $U$ form an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by the centered training images.\n\n### Step 3: Projection onto the Eigenface Subspace\n\nThe next step is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the most significant eigenfaces. The problem specifies using the top $k$ eigenfaces, which correspond to the first $k$ columns of the matrix $U$. This forms the projection basis $U_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{60 \\times k}$.\n\nEach centered training image $x_j - \\mu$ is projected onto this subspace to obtain its low-dimensional representation $z_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$:\n$$\nz_j = U_k^T (x_j - \\mu)\n$$\nSimilarly, for each test image $x_{\\text{test}}$, its centered version is projected to get its coordinate vector $z_{\\text{test}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$:\n$$\nz_{\\text{test}} = U_k^T (x_{\\text{test}} - \\mu)\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Nearest-Neighbor Classification\n\nClassification is performed in the low-dimensional eigenface subspace. For each projected test image $z_{\\text{test}}$, we find the projected training image $z_j$ that is closest to it. The distance is measured using the Euclidean norm:\n$$\nd_j = \\| z_{\\text{test}} - z_j \\|_2\n$$\nThe index $j^*$ of the nearest neighbor is found by minimizing this distance:\n$$\nj^* = \\arg\\min_{j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}} d_j\n$$\nThe problem specifies a tie-breaking rule: if multiple training images are equidistant, the one with the smallest index $j$ is chosen. The predicted identity for the test image is the identity of the training image $x_{j^*}$.\n\nThis predicted identity is then compared to the true identity of the test image. The total count of correctly classified test images is accumulated for each test case.\n\n### Analysis of Special Cases\n\n- **Case 3 ($k=0$):** Here, the projection basis $U_0$ is an empty matrix of size $60 \\times 0$. Consequently, any projection $z = U_0^T (\\dots)$ results in a $0$-dimensional vector. All projected training and test images become the zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^0$. The distance between any projected test image and any projected training image is $\\|0 - 0\\|_2 = 0$. According to the tie-breaking rule, every test image is assigned the identity of the first training image (index $j=0$), which is identity $0$. Since there are $3$ test images belonging to identity $0$, the number of correct classifications is $3$.\n\n- **Case 4 ($k=5$, $\\sigma=0$, degenerate):** In this case, all base vectors are identical, and there is no noise ($\\sigma=0$). Thus, all $15$ training images are identical, $x_j = b$ for all $j$. The mean image is $\\mu = b$. The centered data matrix $X_c$ becomes the zero matrix, as $x_j - \\mu = b - b = 0$. The SVD of the zero matrix yields zero singular values. All projected training vectors $z_j = U_5^T (0)$ are the zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^5$. All test images are also equal to $b$, so their projections $z_{\\text{test}} = U_5^T(b-b)$ are also the zero vector. As in the $k=0$ case, all distances are $0$, and the tie-breaker rule assigns identity $0$ to all test images. The number of correct classifications is again $3$.\n\nThe final output is a list containing the integer counts of correct classifications for each of the four cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the eigenface recognition pipeline for a series of test cases\n    and computes the number of correctly classified images for each.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Set a single fixed pseudo-random seed for deterministic data generation.\n    np.random.seed(0)\n\n    # Define problem parameters\n    m = 60  # Pixels per image\n    C = 3   # Number of identities\n    n_train_per_id = 5\n    n_test_per_id = 3\n    n_train_total = C * n_train_per_id\n    n_test_total = C * n_test_per_id\n\n    # Test suite parameters\n    test_cases = [\n        # (k, sigma, is_degenerate)\n        {'k': 9, 'sigma': 0.1, 'degenerate': False, 'label': 'Case 1'},\n        {'k': 1, 'sigma': 0.25, 'degenerate': False, 'label': 'Case 2'},\n        {'k': 0, 'sigma': 0.0, 'degenerate': False, 'label': 'Case 3'},\n        {'k': 5, 'sigma': 0.0, 'degenerate': True, 'label': 'Case 4'},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        k = case['k']\n        sigma = case['sigma']\n        is_degenerate = case['degenerate']\n\n        # Step 1: Generate synthetic data\n        \n        # Construct base vectors\n        base_vectors = np.zeros((m, C))\n        block_size = m // C\n        if not is_degenerate:\n            for i in range(C):\n                base_vectors[i * block_size : (i + 1) * block_size, i] = 1.0\n        else:\n            base_vectors[0 * block_size : 1 * block_size, 0] = 1.0\n            for i in range(1, C):\n                base_vectors[:, i] = base_vectors[:, 0]\n\n        # Generate training data\n        X_train = np.zeros((m, n_train_total))\n        y_train = np.zeros(n_train_total, dtype=int)\n        img_idx = 0\n        for i in range(C):\n            for _ in range(n_train_per_id):\n                noise = np.random.normal(0, sigma, m)\n                X_train[:, img_idx] = base_vectors[:, i] + noise\n                y_train[img_idx] = i\n                img_idx += 1\n\n        # Generate test data\n        X_test = np.zeros((m, n_test_total))\n        y_test = np.zeros(n_test_total, dtype=int)\n        img_idx = 0\n        for i in range(C):\n            for _ in range(n_test_per_id):\n                noise = np.random.normal(0, sigma, m)\n                X_test[:, img_idx] = base_vectors[:, i] + noise\n                y_test[img_idx] = i\n                img_idx += 1\n        \n        # Step 2: Mean Centering and SVD\n        mu = np.mean(X_train, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n        X_c = X_train - mu\n        \n        U, s, Vt = np.linalg.svd(X_c, full_matrices=False)\n        \n        # Step 3: Projection onto the Eigenface Subspace\n        U_k = U[:, :k]\n        \n        # Project training images\n        Z_train = U_k.T @ X_c\n        \n        # Step 4: Nearest-Neighbor Classification\n        num_correct = 0\n        for i in range(n_test_total):\n            x_test_vec = X_test[:, i]\n            \n            # Center and project the test image\n            x_test_c = x_test_vec.reshape(-1, 1) - mu\n            z_test = U_k.T @ x_test_c\n\n            # Compute distances to all projected training images\n            # The reshape of z_test ensures correct broadcasting\n            distances = np.linalg.norm(Z_train - z_test, axis=0)\n            \n            # Find the index of the nearest neighbor. np.argmin handles ties\n            # by returning the first occurrence, as required.\n            best_match_idx = np.argmin(distances)\n            \n            # Get the predicted label and compare with the true label\n            predicted_label = y_train[best_match_idx]\n            true_label = y_test[i]\n            \n            if predicted_label == true_label:\n                num_correct += 1\n        \n        results.append(num_correct)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3275135"}]}
