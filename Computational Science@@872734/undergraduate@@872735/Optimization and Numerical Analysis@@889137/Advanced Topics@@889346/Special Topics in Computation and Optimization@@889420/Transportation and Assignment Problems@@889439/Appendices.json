There are five volunteers available: Alex, Ben, Chloe, David, and Emily. There are four distinct tasks to be filled: Campus Tour Guide, Information Desk, Workshop Assistant, and Welcome Booth. Each task must be assigned to exactly one volunteer, and no volunteer can be assigned to more than one task.\n\nBased on a survey, each volunteer has provided a preference score, representing their level of interest in each task. A higher score indicates a stronger preference. The scores are compiled in the table below.\n\n| Volunteer | Campus Tour Guide | Information Desk | Workshop Assistant | Welcome Booth |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Alex | 8 | 5 | 7 | 9 |\n| Ben | 6 | 9 | 5 | 8 |\n| Chloe | 7 | 8 | 6 | 7 |\n| David | 5 | 7 | 8 | 6 |\n| Emily | 9 | 6 | 7 | 4 |\n\nSince there are more volunteers than tasks, one volunteer will not be assigned a task.

Assign:\n- Emily to Campus Tour Guide with score $9$,\n- Ben to Information Desk with score $9$,\n- David to Workshop Assistant with score $8$,\n- Alex to Welcome Booth with score $9$.\n\nThese assignments use four distinct volunteers (Alex, Ben, David, Emily) and all four distinct tasks, so this is a feasible assignment.
