Through a carefully designed thought experiment, you will investigate why a numerical scheme might fail. The scenario highlights a fundamental principle: the success of a spectral method depends critically on whether the chosen basis functions can actually represent the solution, which is intimately tied to the forcing function of the PDE.

The specific forcing function for this problem is given by $f(x) = \\sin(8\\pi x)$.\n\nThe analyst chooses to use a spectral Galerkin method. They propose an approximate solution $u_N(x)$ as a finite linear combination of basis functions:\n$$u_N(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} c_k \\phi_k(x)$$\nThe chosen basis functions are the sine eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on this domain, $\\phi_k(x) = \\sin(k\\pi x)$, which automatically satisfy the boundary conditions. For this particular attempt, the analyst sets the number of basis functions to $N=7$.\n\nThe core principle of the Galerkin method is to enforce that the residual of the equation, $R(x) = u_{N,xx}(x) - f(x)$, is orthogonal to every basis function in the chosen set. That is, $\\int_0^1 R(x) \\phi_j(x) dx = 0$ for all $j=1, 2, \\dots, N$. This procedure yields a system of linear equations for the unknown coefficients $c_k$.\n\nWhen the analyst implements this method with $N=7$, the computation returns a solution of $u_7(x) = 0$ for all $x$. This is clearly incorrect, as substituting $u(x)=0$ into the original differential equation yields $0 = \\sin(8\\pi x)$, which is not true.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct fundamental reason for the failure of this specific numerical implementation?\n\nA. The forcing function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to every basis function in the set $\\{\\sin(k\\pi x)\\}_{k=1}^{7}$. Consequently, the projection of $f(x)$ onto the space spanned by these basis functions is zero, resulting in a computed trivial solution $u_7(x)=0$.\n\nB. The system of linear equations for the coefficients $c_k$ becomes singular because the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, indicating that the basis functions are not linearly independent.\n\nC. The sine basis is only appropriate for problems with even-indexed forcing functions, like $\\sin(2n\\pi x)$. The odd-indexed forcing function $\\sin(8\\pi x)$ (as $k=8$ is not a power of 2) requires a cosine basis.\n\nD.
