For it to be the RREF, the pivot in column 2 must be the only non-zero entry in that column. However, the entry in row 1, column 2 is 2, not 0. Therefore, Option A is an REF but not the RREF.

So it is not the RREF.\nSince Options A and B are different, this demonstrates that the REF is not unique. Since Option B is an REF but not the RREF, **B is a correct choice**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:** $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can obtain this matrix by continuing from either Option A or B. Let's start from A: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. To make the pivot in column 2 the only non-zero entry, we perform $R_1 \\leftarrow R_1 - 2R_2$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_1 \\leftarrow R_1 - 2R_2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1-2(0) & 2-2(1) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is Option C. It is in REF, and it also satisfies the additional condition for RREF (all pivots are the only non-zero entries in their columns). Therefore, Option C is the RREF of $A$. The question asks for matrices that are REFs but *not* the RREF. Thus, C is not a correct choice.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix is row-equivalent to A (it is an intermediate step in the derivation of Option B). Let's check if it is an REF.\nCondition 2 for REF states that the first non-zero entry (pivot) in each non-zero row must be 1. The pivot of the first row is 3. Since $3 \\neq 1$, this matrix is not in REF according to the problem's definition. Thus, D is not a correct choice.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:** $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix is row-equivalent to A (it is an intermediate step in the derivation of Option A). Let's check if it is an REF.\nCondition 2 requires the pivot of each non-zero row to be 1. The pivot of the second row is -1. Since $-1 \\neq 1$, this matrix is not in REF. Thus, E is not a correct choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe matrices that are valid Row Echelon Forms of A but not the Reduced Row Echelon Form are A and B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2168399"}]}
