{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in mastering convexity is developing a strong geometric intuition. This exercise challenges you to apply the core definition of a convex set—that the line segment between any two points must lie entirely within the set—to several common shapes in the two-dimensional plane. By analyzing these examples, you will build a visual and analytical toolkit for distinguishing convex from non-convex sets, a fundamental skill for visualizing optimization problems [@problem_id:2164241].", "problem": "In optimization theory, the concept of a convex set is fundamental. A set $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as convex if for any two points $p_1$ and $p_2$ in $S$, the line segment connecting them is entirely contained within $S$. Mathematically, for any $p_1, p_2 \\in S$, the point $p_\\lambda = \\lambda p_1 + (1-\\lambda)p_2$ must also be in $S$ for all $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nConsider the following sets, which are subsets of the two-dimensional real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.

A set is convex if the line segment between any two of its points lies entirely within the set. If we can find a single pair of points in a set for which this property fails, the set is not convex.\n\nLet's examine each set:\n\n**A. $S_A = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y \\ge x^2\\}$**\nThis set describes all points on or above the parabola $y = x^2$. This type of set is known as the epigraph of the function $f(x) = x^2$. A fundamental result in convex analysis states that the epigraph of a convex function is a convex set. To check if $f(x)=x^2$ is a convex function, we compute its second derivative: $f'(x) = 2x$, and $f''(x) = 2$. Since $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$, the function is convex. Therefore, its epigraph, $S_A$, is a convex set.\n\n**B. $S_B = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\le 9\\}$**\nThis inequality describes all points on or inside a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin. This is a closed disk, which is a classic example of a convex set. Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be two points in the disk. The squared distance from the origin of any point $p_\\lambda = \\lambda p_1 + (1-\\lambda)p_2$ on the segment between them is $\\|\\lambda p_1 + (1-\\lambda)p_2\\|^2$. By the convexity of the squared norm function, we have $\\|\\lambda p_1 + (1-\\lambda)p_2\\|^2 \\le \\lambda \\|p_1\\|^2 + (1-\\lambda)\\|p_2\\|^2 \\le \\lambda(9) + (1-\\lambda)(9) = 9$. Thus, every point on the segment is also in the disk. Therefore, $S_B$ is a convex set.\n\n**C. $S_C = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y \\le x^2\\}$**\nThis set describes all points on or below the parabola $y=x^2$. To test for convexity, we can try to find a counterexample. Let's choose two points that are in the set. For instance, consider the points $p_1 = (-2, 4)$ and $p_2 = (2, 4)$. Both points lie on the parabola itself, so they are in $S_C$ (since $4 \\le (-2)^2$ and $4 \\le 2^2$ are both true).\n\nNow, let's examine the midpoint of the line segment connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$. The midpoint corresponds to $\\lambda = 0.5$ in the definition, so $p_{0.5} = 0.5 p_1 + 0.5 p_2$.\n$p_{0.5} = 0.5(-2, 4) + 0.5(2, 4) = (-1, 2) + (1, 2) = (0, 4)$.\nTo check if this midpoint $(x, y) = (0, 4)$ is in the set $S_C$, we must see if it satisfies the inequality $y \\le x^2$.\nPlugging in the coordinates of the midpoint, we get $4 \\le 0^2$, which simplifies to $4 \\le 0$. This inequality is false.\nSince we have found two points in the set $S_C$ such that the midpoint of the segment connecting them is not in $S_C$, the set is not convex.\n\n**D. $S_D = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 3x + 5y \\le 15\\}$**\nThis inequality defines a closed half-plane. A half-plane is a convex set. To show this formally, let $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be in $S_D$. This means $3x_1 + 5y_1 \\le 15$ and $3x_2 + 5y_2 \\le 15$.\nConsider any point $p_\\lambda = (\\lambda x_1 + (1-\\lambda)x_2, \\lambda y_1 + (1-\\lambda)y_2)$ on the segment for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\nWe check if it satisfies the inequality:\n$3(\\lambda x_1 + (1-\\lambda)x_2) + 5(\\lambda y_1 + (1-\\lambda)y_2) = \\lambda(3x_1 + 5y_1) + (1-\\lambda)(3x_2 + 5y_2)$.\nSince $\\lambda \\ge 0$ and $1-\\lambda \\ge 0$, and both points satisfy the inequality:\n$\\lambda(3x_1 + 5y_1) + (1-\\lambda)(3x_2 + 5y_2) \\le \\lambda(15) + (1-\\lambda)(15) = 15$.\nThe condition holds for all points on the segment. Therefore, $S_D$ is a convex set.\n\nThe only set that is not convex is $S_C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2164241"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying if a set is convex, it's crucial to understand how convex sets are constructed from a group of points.
