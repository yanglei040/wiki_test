This exercise [@problem_id:2213009] guides you through the crucial first step: converting a practical minimization problem with 'greater than or equal to' constraints into an initial tableau that is ready for the dual simplex algorithm. Mastering this setup is fundamental, as it ensures you start with the dual feasibility required for the method to proceed correctly.", "problem": "A semiconductor fabrication plant is developing a new process for creating a custom chip that involves three different types of ion implantation steps, denoted as Process 1, Process 2, and Process 3. Let $x_1, x_2, x_3$ represent the duration (in hours) for which each process is run. The total energy consumption, which the plant seeks to minimize, is a linear function of these durations. The objective function to minimize is $E = 4x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3$ in units of megawatt-hours (MWh).\n\nFor the chip to function correctly, two quality control specifications must be met. These relate to the minimum required concentration of two types of dopants, P-type and N-type, which are functions of the process durations.\n1.  P-type dopant concentration constraint: $2x_1 + x_2 + 3x_3 \\ge 10$ (in arbitrary concentration units)\n2.  N-type dopant concentration constraint: $x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 \\ge 12$ (in arbitrary concentration units)\n3.  The durations must be non-negative: $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\ge 0$.\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem using the dual simplex method, you must first set up the initial tableau. The standard form for this method requires converting the $\\ge$ inequalities to $\\le$ inequalities before adding slack variables ($s_1, s_2$) to form equalities. The tableau should be arranged with the objective function row first, followed by the rows for the two constraints. The columns should represent the variables in the order $x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2$.\n\nDetermine the location of the first pivot element that would be chosen according to the rules of the dual simplex algorithm. Express your answer as a pair of integers `(row index, column index)`. These indices refer to the position within the matrix of coefficients corresponding to the constraints (i.e., excluding the objective row and the solution/RHS column). Use 1-based indexing, where row 1 is the first constraint row and column 1 corresponds to variable $x_1$.", "solution": "We are to minimize $E = 4x_{1} + 3x_{2} + 5x_{3}$ subject to\n$$2x_{1} + x_{2} + 3x_{3} \\ge 10, \\quad x_{1} + 2x_{2} + x_{3} \\ge 12, \\quad x_{1},x_{2},x_{3} \\ge 0.$$\n\nTo prepare for the dual simplex method, we first convert the $\\ge$ constraints to $\\le$ constraints by multiplying by $-1$. Then we add slack variables $s_{1}, s_{2} \\ge 0$ to form equalities:\n$$-2x_{1} - x_{2} - 3x_{3} + s_{1} = -10,$$\n$$-x_{1} - 2x_{2} - x_{3} + s_{2} = -12.$$\n\nThe objective function can be written as $E - 4x_{1} - 3x_{2} - 5x_{3} = 0$. For a minimization problem, the objective row of the simplex tableau typically contains the reduced costs $z_j - c_j$. Initially, with basic variables $s_1, s_2$ having zero cost, the reduced costs for the non-basic variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are $0 - c_j$.\n- Objective row $(z_j - c_j)$: $(-4, -3, -5, 0, 0)$.\n- Constraint 1 row: $(-2, -1, -3, 1, 0)$ with RHS $-10$.\n- Constraint 2 row: $(-1, -2, -1, 0, 1)$ with RHS $-12$.\n\nThe initial basic solution is $s_1 = -10, s_2 = -12$, which is primal infeasible. The reduced costs in the objective row are all non-positive, which is the condition for dual feasibility in a minimization problem. Thus, the dual simplex method can be applied.\n\nDual simplex pivot selection:\n1.  **Select Leaving Variable**: Choose the row with the most negative RHS value. Here, $\\min\\{-10, -12\\} = -12$, so the pivot row is the second constraint row (row index 2). The leaving variable is $s_2$.\n2.  **Select Entering Variable**: In the pivot row (row 2), identify non-basic variables with strictly negative coefficients. These are $x_1, x_2, x_3$ (coefficients $-1, -2, -1$). Compute the absolute value of the ratio of the reduced cost to the pivot row coefficient for each candidate:\n    - For $x_1$: $|\\frac{z_1 - c_1}{a_{2,1}}| = |\\frac{-4}{-1}| = 4$\n    - For $x_2$: $|\\frac{z_2 - c_2}{a_{2,2}}| = |\\frac{-3}{-2}| = 1.5$\n    - For $x_3$: $|\\frac{z_3 - c_3}{a_{2,3}}| = |\\frac{-5}{-1}| = 5$\nThe minimum ratio is $1.5$, which corresponds to variable $x_2$ (column index 2). Therefore, $x_2$ is the entering variable.\n\nThe pivot element is at the intersection of the pivot row (row 2) and the pivot column (column 2). This is the coefficient of $x_2$ in the second constraint, which is $-2$.

This is the correct starting condition for the dual simplex method.\n\n**Step 1: Select the Leaving Variable**\nThe leaving variable is the basic variable with the most negative RHS value. The RHS values for the basic variables are $x_3=10$, $x_4=-4$, and $x_5=-5$. The most negative value is $-5$, so the leaving variable is $x_5$. The row corresponding to $x_5$ is the pivot row.\n\n**Step 2: Select the Entering Variable**\nThe entering variable is chosen using the dual ratio test. We consider non-basic variables with strictly negative coefficients in the pivot row (the $x_5$ row). The coefficients are $-2$ for $x_1$ and $-1$ for $x_2$. Both are candidates. We compute the ratio $\\frac{z_j-c_j}{-a_{ij}}$ for each candidate and choose the minimum.\n- For $x_1$: $\\frac{3}{-(-2)} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$\n- For $x_2$: $\\frac{2}{-(-1)} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$\nThe minimum ratio is $1.5$, which corresponds to $x_1$.

Thus, $s_2$ leaves the basis, and its row is the new pivot row.\n2.  **Select Entering Variable**: We look for non-basic variables with strictly negative coefficients in the pivot row ($s_2$-row).

This situation serves as a proof that the primal problem is infeasible. It is impossible to perform a pivot that would both remove the primal infeasibility and maintain dual feasibility.\n\nThe original constraints are equivalent to $x_1 + x_2 \\ge 5$ and $x_1 + x_2 \\le 2$. These two conditions are contradictory, confirming that there is no feasible solution.\n\nTherefore, the associated LP is infeasible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2212994"}]}
