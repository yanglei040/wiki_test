The profit is described by a Linear Programming (LP) model. Let $x_1$ be the quantity (in tons) of product P1 produced, and let $x_2$ be a variable representing the net change in the inventory of a crucial catalyst C1 (in kilograms). A positive value of $x_2$ indicates that more catalyst was produced as a byproduct than was consumed, and this surplus is sold for a profit. A negative value of $x_2$ indicates a net consumption of the catalyst, which must be purchased, incurring a cost.\n\nThe company aims to maximize its total profit $P$, given by the objective function:\n$$ \\text{Maximize } P = 250x_1 + 30x_2 $$\n\nThe production is subject to the following constraints:\n1.  $4x_1 + x_2 \\le 100$ (Constraint on reactor time)\n2.  $2x_1 - 3x_2 \\le 60$ (Constraint on raw material availability)\n\nThe variable for product P1, $x_1$, must be non-negative ($x_1 \\ge 0$). However, as described, the catalyst inventory change, $x_2$, is unrestricted in sign ($x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\n\nTo solve this problem using the simplex method, it must first be converted into an equivalent standard form where all decision variables are non-negative.

Option B is false because the standard $x_{2} = x_{2}' - x_{2}''$ transformation always converts an unrestricted variable into two nonnegative variables. Option D would correspond to defining $x_{2} = -x_{2}' + x_{2}''$, which is merely a relabeling of the roles of $x_{2}'$ and $x_{2}''$ but is not the conventional representation indicated by $x_{2} = x_{2}' - x_{2}''$.

To resolve any potential ambiguities in selecting the entering and leaving variables, you must strictly follow Bland's smallest-index anti-cycling rule. After completing this pivot, the variable that was basic in the pivot row will become non-basic. Determine the new reduced cost for this specific variable.", "solution": "The goal is to perform one pivot operation on the given simplex tableau using Bland's smallest-index rule and find the new reduced cost of the leaving variable.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Entering Variable**\n\nFirst, we identify the non-basic variables and their reduced costs. The basic variables are $\\{x_1, x_3, x_4, x_6\\}$, so the non-basic variables are $\\{x_2, x_5\\}$. The reduced costs are their coefficients in the objective row.\n- The reduced cost of $x_2$ is $-2$.\n- The reduced cost of $x_5$ is $-4$.\n\nFor a maximization problem, a variable is a candidate to enter the basis if its reduced cost is negative. Both $x_2$ and $x_5$ are candidates.\n\nBland's smallest-index rule states that we must choose the variable with the smallest index among all candidates. The indices of the candidates are 2 and 5. Since $2 < 5$, we must select $x_2$ as the entering variable. The second column (the column for $x_2$) is the pivot column.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Leaving Variable**\n\nNext, we perform the minimum ratio test to find the leaving variable. We calculate the ratio of the RHS value to the corresponding positive entry in the pivot column ($x_2$ column) for each row associated with a basic variable.\n\n- **Row for $x_1$**: The entry in the $x_2$ column is 2 (which is positive). The ratio is $\\frac{10}{2} = 5$.\n- **Row for $x_3$**: The entry in the $x_2$ column is 4 (which is positive). The ratio is $\\frac{12}{4} = 3$.\n- **Row for $x_4$**: The entry in the $x_2$ column is 1 (which is positive). The ratio is $\\frac{0}{1} = 0$.\n- **Row for $x_6$**: The entry in the $x_2$ column is 3 (which is positive). The ratio is $\\frac{0}{3} = 0$.\n\nThe minimum non-negative ratio is 0. We have a tie between the row for $x_4$ and the row for $x_6$.\n\nBland's smallest-index rule is used to break this tie. We must choose the variable with the smallest index to leave the basis. The indices of the tied basic variables are 4 (for $x_4$) and 6 (for $x_6$). Since $4 < 6$, we select $x_4$ as the leaving variable.\n\nThe pivot row is the row corresponding to the basic variable $x_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Pivot Operation**\n\nThe pivot element is at the intersection of the pivot column ($x_2$) and the pivot row (row for $x_4$). The pivot element is 1.\n\nThe variable $x_4$ will leave the basis, and the question asks for its new reduced cost. The new reduced cost of $x_4$ will be its coefficient in the objective row of the new tableau.
