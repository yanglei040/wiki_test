The theory requires that both solutions be feasible for their respective problems before checking complementary slackness.\n\nFirst, let's confirm feasibility:\n- **Primal Feasibility ($x'$):**\n  - Constraint 1: $x_1' = 4 \\le 4$. (OK)\n  - Constraint 2: $2x_2' = 2(3) = 6 \\le 12$. (OK)\n  - Constraint 3: $3x_1' + 2x_2' = 3(4) + 2(3) = 12 + 6 = 18 \\le 18$. (OK)\n  - Non-negativity: $x_1', x_2' \\ge 0$.

Primal Variable / Dual Constraint Conditions:**\n- **Condition for $x_1$ (Option A):** The primal variable is $x_1' = 4 > 0$. This requires the corresponding first dual constraint, $y_1 + 3y_3 \\ge 3$, to be tight (hold with equality).\n  $y_1' + 3y_3' = 0 + 3(1) = 3$.\n  Since $3 = 3$, the constraint is tight. This condition is **satisfied**.\n- **Condition for $x_2$ (Option B):** The primal variable is $x_2' = 3 > 0$. This requires the corresponding second dual constraint, $2y_2 + 2y_3 \\ge 5$, to be tight.\n  $2y_2' + 2y_3' = 2(1.5) + 2(1) = 5$.\n  Since $5 = 5$, the constraint is tight.

The slack is $4 - x_1' = 4 - 4 = 0$. Since the slack is zero, the condition is automatically **satisfied**, regardless of the value of $y_1'$.\n- **Condition for Primal Constraint 2 (Option D):** The constraint is $2x_2 \\le 12$. The slack is $12 - 2x_2' = 12 - 2(3) = 6$. Since the slack is positive ($6 > 0$), this requires the corresponding dual variable, $y_2'$, to be zero.

The product of the primal slack and dual variable is $6 \\times 1.5 = 9 \\ne 0$.\n- **Condition for Primal Constraint 3 (Option E):** The constraint is $3x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 18$. The slack is $18 - (3x_1' + 2x_2') = 18 - (3(4) + 2(3)) = 0$.

The surplus is $15 - 15 = 0$. This constraint is tight, so complementary slackness gives no information about $x_1^*$.\n- Dual Constraint 2: $y_1^* + y_2^* = 3 + 4 = 7$. The surplus is $7 - 6 = 1 > 0$. Since the surplus is positive, the corresponding primal variable $x_2^*$ must be zero. So, $x_2^* = 0$.\n- Dual Constraint 3: $2y_1^* + y_2^* = 2(3) + 4 = 10$. The surplus is $10 - 10 = 0$.

From Step 2, we know that $x_2^*=0$. We can substitute this into the system:\n1. $x_1^* + 0 + 2x_3^* = 9 \\implies x_1^* + 2x_3^* = 9$\n2. $3x_1^* + 0 + x_3^* = 17 \\implies 3x_1^* + x_3^* = 17$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express $x_1^*$ in terms of $x_3^*$: $x_1^* = 9 - 2x_3^*$.\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n$3(9 - 2x_3^*) + x_3^* = 17$\n$27 - 6x_3^* + x_3^* = 17$\n$27 - 5x_3^* = 17$\n$10 = 5x_3^*$\n$x_3^* = 2$\n\nNow, find $x_1^*$ using the expression from before:\n$x_1^* = 9 - 2(2) = 9 - 4 = 5$.\n\nThe resulting primal solution is $x^* = (5, 0, 2)$.
