The goal is to maximize profit subject to certain production constraints. After formulating the problem, the analyst converts it into the standard form for a Linear Programming (LP) problem. The standard form requires an objective function to be maximized, all constraints to be equalities, and all variables to be non-negative.\n\nThe resulting standard form LP is given as:\n\nMaximize $Z = 1200x_1 + 1850x_2$\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1. $4x_1 + 6x_2 + x_3 = 900$\n2. $10x_1 + 5x_2 + x_4 = 1500$\n3. $x_1 + x_2 - x_5 = 50$\n4. $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 \\geq 0$\n\nHere, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the decision variables representing the number of units of Drone Type A and Drone Type B produced, respectively.
