The production process is subject to several constraints based on available resources. The goal is to determine the production quantities that maximize total profit.\n\nLet $x_1$ be the number of batches of Polymer A produced and $x_2$ be the number of batches of Polymer B produced. The total profit, $P$, is given by the objective function $P = 40x_1 + 32x_2$.\n\nThe production is constrained by three factors:\n1.  **Catalyst Availability:** The production requires a rare-earth catalyst. A total of 600 grams of the catalyst are available per week. Each batch of Polymer A requires 12 grams of catalyst, and each batch of Polymer B requires 10 grams.\n2.  **Reactor Time:** The main chemical reactor has a maximum of 400 hours of operational time available per week. Each batch of Polymer A takes 5 hours, and each batch of Polymer B takes 8 hours.\n3.  **Contractual Obligation:** The company has a contract with a client which stipulates that the total number of batches produced (both A and B combined) must be at least 30 per week to maintain the supply chain agreement.\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method, one must first convert the system into standard form, which may require introducing slack, surplus, and artificial variables. The \"Big M\" method will be used, where a large positive constant $M$ is introduced to handle the artificial variable(s).\n\nAfter setting up the problem in standard form, the initial simplex tableau must be made canonical by performing row operations to ensure that the coefficients of all basic variables in the objective function row are zero. Your task is to find the resulting objective function row for this initial canonical tableau.\n\nDetermine the coefficients in the objective function row corresponding to the variables $x_1$, $x_2$, the surplus variable associated with the contractual obligation constraint, and the Right-Hand-Side (RHS) value.
