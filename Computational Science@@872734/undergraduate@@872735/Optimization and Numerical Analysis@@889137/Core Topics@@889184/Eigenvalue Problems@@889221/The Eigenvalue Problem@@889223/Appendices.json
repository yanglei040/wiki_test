For any square matrix, the sum of its eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the matrix (the sum of the diagonal elements), and the product of its eigenvalues is equal to the determinant of the matrix.\n\nLet the matrix be $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are given as $\\lambda_1 = 4$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$.\n\nFirst, we use the property related to the trace of the matrix:\n$$\n\\text{tr}(A) = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2\n$$\nThe trace of our matrix $A$ is $a + d$. The sum of the eigenvalues is $4 + (-2) = 2$. Therefore, we can write our first equation:\n$$\na + d = 2\n$$\nWe are given that $a=1$. Substituting this value into the equation gives:\n$$\n1 + d = 2\n$$\nSolving for $d$, we find:\n$$\nd = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$\nSo, the entry $d$ is 1.\n\nNext, we use the property related to the determinant of the matrix:\n$$\n\\det(A) = \\lambda_1 \\times \\lambda_2\n$$\nThe determinant of our $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A$ is $ad - bc$. The product of the eigenvalues is $(4) \\times (-2) = -8$. This gives us our second equation:\n$$\nad - bc = -8\n$$\nWe are given the values $a = 1$ and $b = 3$, and we just found that $d = 1$. Substituting these values into the determinant equation:\n$$\n(1)(1) - (3)c = -8\n$$\n$$\n1 - 3c = -8\n$$\nNow, we solve for $c$:\n$$\n-3c = -8 - 1\n$$\n$$\n-3c = -9\n$$\n$$\nc = \\frac{-9}{-3} = 3\n$$\nSo, the entry $c$ is 3.\n\nWe have now found all the entries of the matrix: $a=1$, $b=3$, $c=3$, and $d=1$.
