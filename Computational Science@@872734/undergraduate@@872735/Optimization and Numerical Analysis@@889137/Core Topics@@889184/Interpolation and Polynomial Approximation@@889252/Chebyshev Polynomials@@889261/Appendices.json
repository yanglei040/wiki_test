A standard technique is the economization of a function's Taylor series. This process involves truncating the Taylor series at a certain degree, then reducing the degree of the resulting polynomial further by approximating the highest power terms using Chebyshev polynomials, which minimizes the introduced error in the uniform norm.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\ln(x+2)$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$. Your task is to apply the power series economization method, starting with the Maclaurin series (Taylor series centered at $x=0$) for $f(x)$. Determine the minimal integer degree $n$ of an economized polynomial $P_n(x)$ that can guarantee a maximum absolute error, $|f(x) - P_n(x)|$, of less than $\\epsilon = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$ for all $x \\in [-1, 1]$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal degree $n$ of a polynomial approximation $P_n(x)$ for $f(x) = \\ln(x+2)$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$ such that the maximum absolute error is less than $\\epsilon = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$. The most efficient polynomial approximation for this purpose is obtained by truncating the function's exact Chebyshev series. The error of this truncation, $|f(x) - P_n(x)|$, is bounded by the tail of the series.\n\nFirst, we need the coefficients of the Chebyshev series for $f(x) = \\ln(x+2)$. This is a standard result. For a function of the form $\\ln(a+x)$ with $a > 1$, the Chebyshev coefficients on $[-1, 1]$ are given by:\n$$ c_k = \\frac{2(-1)^{k+1}}{k} (a-\\sqrt{a^2-1})^k \\quad \\text{for } k \\ge 1 $$\nFor our function, $a=2$. Thus, $a-\\sqrt{a^2-1} = 2-\\sqrt{3}$. Let's denote this value by $r$. The magnitude of the coefficients is:\n$$ |c_k| = \\frac{2r^k}{k} \\quad \\text{for } k \\ge 1 $$\nThe error from truncating the series at degree $n$, $P_n(x) = c_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^n c_k T_k(x)$, is bounded by the sum of the magnitudes of the remaining coefficients, because $|T_k(x)| \\le 1$:\n$$ E_n = \\max_{x \\in [-1,1]}|f(x) - P_n(x)| \\le \\sum_{k=n+1}^{\\infty} |c_k| = 2\\sum_{k=n+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{r^k}{k} $$\nWe must find the smallest integer $n$ for which this error bound is less than $5 \\times 10^{-4}$. We can evaluate the tail sum numerically. A useful identity is $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{r^k}{k} = -\\ln(1-r)$. The tail sum can therefore be written as:\n$$ E_n = 2\\left( \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{r^k}{k}\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{r^k}{k}\\right) \\right) = 2\\left( -\\ln(1-r) - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{r^k}{k} \\right) $$\nWith $r = 2-\\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.267949$, we have $-\\ln(1-r) = -\\ln(\\sqrt{3}-1) \\approx 0.3119054$.
