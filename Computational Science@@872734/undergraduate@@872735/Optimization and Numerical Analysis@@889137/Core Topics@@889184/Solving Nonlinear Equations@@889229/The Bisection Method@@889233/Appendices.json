Let's verify this for the initial interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the function at the endpoints $a=0$ and $b=1$.\nFor $x=a=0$:\n$$f(0) = (0)^5 + (0) - 1 = -1$$\nFor $x=b=1$:\n$$f(1) = (1)^5 + (1) - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1$$\nSince $f(0) = -1$ (negative) and $f(1) = 1$ (positive), the signs are opposite, and we can confirm that at least one root lies within the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nStep 2: Perform one iteration of the bisection method. The first step is to calculate the midpoint of the interval.\nLet the midpoint be $c$.\n$$c = \\frac{a + b}{2} = \\frac{0 + 1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the function at the midpoint $c=0.5$.\n$$f(0.5) = (0.5)^5 + (0.5) - 1$$\n$$f(0.5) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 + \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{16}{32} - \\frac{32}{32} = \\frac{1+16-32}{32} = -\\frac{15}{32}$$\nIn decimal form, this is $f(0.5) = 0.03125 + 0.5 - 1 = -0.46875$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the new interval by comparing the sign of $f(c)$ with the signs of $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.\nWe have:\n- $f(a) = f(0) = -1$ (negative)\n- $f(b) = f(1) = 1$ (positive)\n- $f(c) = f(0.5) = -0.46875$ (negative)\n\nThe bisection method states that the root lies in the subinterval where the function values at the endpoints have opposite signs.\n- Comparing $[a, c] = [0, 0.5]$: $f(0)$ is negative and $f(0.5)$ is negative. They have the same sign.\n- Comparing $[c, b] = [0.5, 1]$: $f(0.5)$ is negative and $f(1)$ is positive. They have opposite signs.\n\nTherefore, the root must lie in the interval $[0.5, 1]$.
