{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our first practice dives into the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, a simple yet powerful instance-based method. This exercise provides one of the most direct illustrations of overfitting: the $k=1$ classifier, which memorizes the training data perfectly, resulting in zero training error [@problem_id:3135589]. By comparing this misleading metric with a more realistic estimate of generalization performance using leave-one-out cross-validation, you will gain a foundational intuition for why minimizing training error alone is a flawed strategy.", "problem": "You are given a classification setting with a finite training dataset, where each observation is a pair $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$ with feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and class label $y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, for $i = 1, \\dots, n$. The fundamental base consists of: (i) the definition of the Euclidean distance $d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{z}) = \\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z}\\|_2$, (ii) the $k$-nearest neighbors rule that selects the $k$ training observations with the smallest distances to the query point, (iii) the empirical risk (resubstitution error) defined under $0$-$1$ loss as the average number of misclassifications made when each training point is predicted using a specified classifier and the full training set, and (iv) leave-one-out cross-validation that evaluates the classifier by, for each training point, predicting it using the training set with that point removed, and averaging the resulting $0$-$1$ losses. In all computations, ties in distances must be broken deterministically: when ordering neighbors by distance, sort by ascending distance, then prioritize the point itself if present, and finally break any remaining ties by ascending index. For majority voting in classification when $k \\ge 2$, if there is a tie in class counts among the $k$ neighbors, select the smallest class label.\n\nTask A: Starting from the definitions above, confirm that the empirical risk (resubstitution error) for the $k=1$ nearest neighbor classifier is $0$ when the neighbor set for each training point includes the point itself. Then, compute the leave-one-out error for $k=1$ and compare it to the resubstitution error for $k=2$ on the datasets specified below. The comparison must be based on numerical values of the error rates.\n\nTask B: Based on the observed numerical comparison, analyze the implications for model selection between $k=1$ and $k=2$ using resubstitution error versus leave-one-out error, grounding your discussion in the definitions provided (your analysis is to be presented in your solution, not printed by the code).\n\nUse the following test suite of datasets, each given by a matrix of features and a vector of labels.

A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n### Task A: Confirmation and Computation\n\n**Part 1: Confirmation of Zero Empirical Risk for $k=1$**\n\nThe empirical risk, or resubstitution error, for a classifier is calculated by applying the classifier to each point $\\mathbf{x}_i$ in the training set and measuring the prediction error against the known label $y_i$. For the $k=1$ nearest neighbor classifier, we must find the single closest point to $\\mathbf{x}_i$ within the full training set $\\{(\\mathbf{x}_j, y_j)\\}_{j=1}^n$.\n\nBy definition, the Euclidean distance of a point to itself is $d(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_i) = 0$. For any other distinct point $\\mathbf{x}_j$ (where $j \\ne i$), the distance $d(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)$ must be greater than $0$. Consequently, the nearest neighbor to any training point $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is always the point $\\mathbf{x}_i$ itself. The problem's tie-breaking rules explicitly state to prioritize the point itself if present, reinforcing this conclusion.\n\nThe $1$-NN prediction for the label of $\\mathbf{x}_i$, denoted $\\hat{y}_i$, is thus the label of its nearest neighbor, which is $y_i$. The $0$-$1$ loss for this prediction is $L_{0-1}(\\hat{y}_i, y_i) = L_{0-1}(y_i, y_i) = 0$. Since the prediction is correct for every point in the training set, the total number of errors is $0$. The empirical risk, being the average loss, is therefore $E^{\\text{train}, k=1} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n 0 = 0$. This holds universally for any dataset where all training points are unique. Therefore, for all datasets $j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, $E_{j}^{\\text{train}, k=1} = 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computations**\n\nWe now compute $E_{j}^{\\text{LOO}, k=1}$ and $E_{j}^{\\text{train}, k=2}$ for each dataset.\n\n**Dataset 1**: $X_1 = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 0.0  0.0 \\\\ 0.0  1.0 \\\\ 5.0  5.0 \\\\ 5.0  6.0 \\end{array}\\right]$, $y_1 = [0, 0, 1, 1]$, $n=4$.\n- **$E_{1}^{\\text{LOO}, k=1}$**:\n    - For $\\mathbf{x}_1=(0.0, 0.0)$, $y_1=0$: Nearest point in $\\{\\mathbf{x}_2, \\mathbf{x}_3, \\mathbf{x}_4\\}$ is $\\mathbf{x}_2$ (distance $1.0$).

If a practitioner were to select $k$ by minimizing the resubstitution error, they would invariably choose $k=1$, as it achieves a perfect score. This choice corresponds to a model that has zero training error because it has memorized the training data. This phenomenon is a classic example of overfitting. The model has high variance and is sensitive to every single data point, including noise, but its training error gives a misleadingly optimistic assessment of its performance on new, unseen data.\n\n2.  **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation Provides a More Realistic Assessment**: The leave-one-out error, $E^{\\text{LOO}, k=1}$, gives a more honest (less biased) estimate of the generalization error. For Dataset $1$, where classes are perfectly separated, LOOCV correctly identifies that a $1$-NN classifier performs flawlessly ($E_{1}^{\\text{LOO}, k=1}=0.0$). However, for Datasets $2$ and $3$, which feature class overlap and a noisy point respectively, the LOOCV error for $k=1$ is substantial ($0.667$ and $0.6$). This high error correctly signals that the $k=1$ model is not robust and overfits the training data. In noisy regions, a point's single nearest neighbor is likely to be from the wrong class, causing LOOCV to report high error.\n\n3.  **Comparing Model Complexities**: Choosing $k$ involves a bias-variance trade-off. A small $k$ (like $k=1$) results in a a low-bias, high-variance model with a very complex decision boundary. A larger $k$ increases bias but decreases variance, resulting in a smoother, less complex decision boundary. The severe performance degradation of $k=1$ under LOOCV in Datasets $2$ and $3$ indicates that its high variance leads to poor generalization.\n\n4.  **Interpretation of $E^{\\text{train}, k=2}$**: The resubstitution error for $k=2$ is non-zero for the noisy datasets. This is because the prediction is an average over two points. For instance, in Dataset $3$, when classifying point $\\mathbf{x}_3$ (label $1$), its neighbors are itself (label $1$) and the noisy point $\\mathbf{x}_5$ (label $0$). The resulting tie is broken by choosing label $0$, causing a misclassification even on the training data. While $E^{\\text{train}, k=2}$ is still an optimistically biased estimate, it is more informative than the vacuous $E^{\\text{train}, k=1}=0$. The comparison required by the problem, $E^{\\text{LOO}, k=1}$ versus $E^{\\text{train}, k=2}$, is not a methodologically sound way to choose between $k=1$ and $k=2$, as it compares a nearly unbiased error estimate for one model with a biased estimate for another. A proper comparison would be between $E^{\\text{LOO}, k=1}$ and $E^{\\text{LOO}, k=2}$. Nonetheless, the results ($0.667$ vs $0.333$ and $0.6$ vs $0.4$) illustrate a crucial point: an unstable model ($k=1$) may have a very high generalization error, potentially even higher than the (optimistic) training error of a more stable model ($k=2$).\n\nIn conclusion, for model selection in $k$-NN, resubstitution error is a flawed metric, particularly for small $k$. It systematically favors models that overfit. Cross-validation methods like LOOCV provide far more reliable estimates of a model's ability to generalize, and are essential for tuning hyperparameters like $k$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes k-NN error rates for three datasets as specified in the problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    datasets = [\n        (\n            np.array([[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [5.0, 5.0], [5.0, 6.0]]),\n            np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])\n        ),\n        (\n            np.array([[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.1], [0.05, 0.0]]),\n            np.array([0, 0, 1])\n        ),\n        (\n            np.array([[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 2.0], [2.0, 0.0], [2.0, 2.0], [1.1, 1.0]]),\n            np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 0])\n        )\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for X, y in datasets:\n        n, d = X.shape\n        \n        # Task 1: Empirical risk for k=1 (E_train, k=1)\n        # This is analytically guaranteed to be 0, as each point is its own nearest neighbor.\n        e_train_k1 = 0.0\n        \n        # Task 2: Leave-one-out error for k=1 (E_LOO, k=1)\n        loo_errors = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            x_query = X[i]\n            y_true = y[i]\n            \n            min_dist = np.inf\n            best_idx = -1\n            \n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j:\n                    continue\n                \n                dist = np.linalg.norm(x_query - X[j])\n                \n                if dist  min_dist:\n                    min_dist = dist\n                    best_idx = j\n                elif dist == min_dist:\n                    # Tie-breaking by ascending index\n                    if j  best_idx:\n                        best_idx = j\n            \n            y_pred = y[best_idx]\n            if y_pred != y_true:\n                loo_errors += 1\n        \n        e_loo_k1 = loo_errors / n\n\n        # Task 3: Empirical risk for k=2 (E_train, k=2)\n        train_k2_errors = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            x_query = X[i]\n            y_true = y[i]\n            \n            # The first neighbor is the point itself.\n            neighbor1_label = y_true\n            \n            # Find the second neighbor (closest among other points).\n            min_dist = np.inf\n            best_idx = -1\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j:\n                    continue\n                \n                dist = np.linalg.norm(x_query - X[j])\n                if dist  min_dist:\n                    min_dist = dist\n                    best_idx = j\n                elif dist == min_dist:\n                    # Tie-breaking by ascending index\n                    if j  best_idx:\n                        best_idx = j\n            \n            neighbor2_label = y[best_idx]\n            \n            # Majority vote with tie-breaking\n            if neighbor1_label == neighbor2_label:\n                y_pred = neighbor1_label\n            else:  # Tie in votes (one for each class)\n                y_pred = 0  # Select smallest class label\n                \n            if y_pred != y_true:\n                train_k2_errors += 1\n        \n        e_train_k2 = train_k2_errors / n\n        \n        all_results.append([e_train_k1, e_loo_k1, e_train_k2])\n\n    # Format the final output string as specified.\n    outer_list_str = []\n    for res in all_results:\n        inner_list_str = f\"[{','.join(map(str, res))}]\"\n        outer_list_str.append(inner_list_str)\n    \n    print(f\"[{','.join(outer_list_str)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3135589"}, {"introduction": "Next, we explore the classic bias-variance trade-off within the context of linear models using Ridge Regression.

Thus, the unique solution is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\lambda} = (X^T X + n\\lambda I)^{-1} X^T y\n$$\nFor the special case $\\lambda = 0$, the problem reduces to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). If the matrix $X^T X$ is singular (e.g., in the underdetermined case where $n  d$), there are infinitely many solutions that minimize the training error. The problem specifies using the minimum Euclidean norm solution, which is uniquely given by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse $X^{+}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{0} = X^{+} y\n$$\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, generate the training data $(X, y)$ and test data $(X_{\\text{test}}, y_{\\text{test}})$ according to the specified deterministic formulas. The parameters $n, d, m$, and the functions for generating the matrices, true parameter vector $\\beta^{\\star}$, and noise terms are provided.

With the computed $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\lambda}$, calculate the training and test Mean Squared Errors (MSE):\n    $$\n    R_{\\text{train}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\lambda}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\|y - X\\hat{\\beta}_{\\lambda}\\|_{2}^{2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    R_{\\text{test}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\lambda}) = \\frac{1}{m}\\|y_{\\text{test}} - X_{\\text{test}}\\hat{\\beta}_{\\lambda}\\|_{2}^{2}\n    $$\n5.  After computing the errors for all $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$, identify the index $k^{\\star}$ corresponding to the $\\lambda^{\\star}$ that minimizes the test error $R_{\\text{test}}$. In case of a tie, the smallest index is chosen.\n6.  Finally, perform the check to see if the training error at this optimal $\\lambda^{\\star}$, $R_{\\text{train}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\lambda^{\\star}})$, is strictly greater than the minimum training error observed across the grid. The training error for ridge regression is a monotonically non-decreasing function of $\\lambda$. Therefore, the minimum training error occurs at $\\lambda=0$.

A fully grown decision tree can create partitions so fine that every leaf is pure, perfectly classifying the training data and achieving zero training error—a clear case of extreme overfitting [@problem_id:3188147]. This exercise challenges you to implement cost-complexity pruning, a technique that systematically simplifies the tree to improve its generalization, demonstrating the crucial principle that a less complex model with higher training error can often be a more accurate model on unseen data.", "problem": "You must write a complete and runnable program that constructs a binary classification decision tree grown to purity on a synthetic dataset, and then applies cost-complexity pruning to demonstrate the contrast between empirical training error and out-of-sample test error. Your code must implement all logic without relying on external machine learning libraries; only basic numerical libraries are allowed. All symbols, variables, and numbers in this problem are written in LaTeX.\n\nThe fundamental base you must use consists of the following definitions and principles.\n\n- Empirical risk with zero-one loss: given data $\\{(x_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ with $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, the empirical misclassification count of a classifier $h$ is $R(h) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{1}\\{h(x_i) \\neq y_i\\}$. The empirical misclassification rate is $\\hat r(h) = R(h)/n$.\n- Out-of-sample test misclassification rate is defined analogously on an independent test set drawn from the same data-generating mechanism as the training set; denote it by $r_{\\text{test}}(h)$.\n- A decision tree classifier recursively partitions $\\mathbb{R}^d$ by axis-aligned threshold splits and assigns a class label to each terminal region (leaf). A leaf’s prediction is the majority class among training samples that fall into that leaf.\n- Full growth to purity: continue splitting until every leaf contains samples from a single class or until every leaf contains at most one training sample. Under distinct feature vectors, this yields $\\hat r_{\\text{train}} = 0$.\n- Cost-complexity pruning: given a tree $T$, define the penalized empirical objective\n$$\nR_{\\alpha}(T) = R(T) + \\alpha \\cdot |T|,\n$$\nwhere $R(T)$ is the empirical misclassification count induced by $T$ on the training set and $|T|$ is the number of leaves in $T$. For any $\\alpha \\ge 0$, the pruned subtree $T_{\\alpha}$ minimizes $R_{\\alpha}(T)$ among all subtrees of the fully grown tree.\n\nYour program must implement:\n\n1. Training a binary decision tree on the training set using axis-aligned splits. Use the Gini impurity to choose splits whenever it reduces impurity. If no split reduces impurity but a node contains at least two samples with differing labels, you must still split so that full growth to purity is achieved (for example, by separating adjacent samples along some feature). Stop only when every leaf is pure or contains exactly one sample.\n2. Computing the empirical training misclassification rate $\\hat r_{\\text{train}}$ and the test misclassification rate $r_{\\text{test}}$ for a given tree.\n3. Computing the standard weakest-link cost-complexity pruning path for the fully grown tree. At each internal node $t$, let $R(t)$ be the empirical misclassification count if $t$ were replaced by a leaf predicting the node’s majority class, and let $R(T_t)$ be the current subtree misclassification count under $t$. Let $L_t$ be the number of leaves under node $t$. The node-specific pruning value is\n$$\ng(t) = \\frac{R(t) - R(T_t)}{L_t - 1}.\n$$\nPrune simultaneously all internal nodes achieving the smallest $g(t)$ to obtain the next subtree on the path, and repeat until a single-leaf tree remains. This yields a nondecreasing sequence $\\alpha_0 \\le \\alpha_1 \\le \\dots$ where each $\\alpha_k$ is the minimum $g(t)$ at step $k$.\n4. Selecting the subtree for a given $\\alpha \\ge 0$ as follows: choose the largest subtree on the pruning path whose associated threshold $\\alpha_k \\le \\alpha$. When $\\alpha = 0$, this must select the fully grown tree.\n\nData generation must be deterministic and scientifically realistic:\n\n- Input space dimension is $d=2$. For a given sample size $n$, generate features $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 2}$ with independent coordinates uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. Use a deterministic pseudo-random number generator seeded by a specified integer to ensure reproducibility.\n- Define the underlying noise-free label by\n$$\ny^{\\star} = \\mathbf{1}\\{x_1  \\tau(x_2)\\}, \\quad \\text{where } \\tau(u) = \\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{4}\\sin(4\\pi u).\n$$\n- Inject label noise independently: with probability $\\eta \\in [0,1)$, flip $y^{\\star}$ to $1 - y^{\\star}$. Use an independent pseudo-random generator stream, also deterministically seeded, for the flips.\n- The test set is generated independently from the same mechanism with its own specified seed. Report all misclassification rates as real numbers in $[0,1]$.\n\nTest suite and required outputs:\n\nImplement the following three test cases. For each case, you must construct the fully grown tree $T_{\\text{full}}$, compute its training misclassification rate $\\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\text{full}})$ and test misclassification rate $r_{\\text{test}}(T_{\\text{full}})$, then produce the pruned tree $T_{\\alpha}$ for the specified $\\alpha$ and compute the corresponding rates. Your program must return a single list of three booleans, one per test case, aggregated as a single line string in the specified format.\n\n- Test case $1$ (happy path: demonstrate overfitting and improvement under pruning):\n  - Parameters: $n_{\\text{train}} = 120$, $n_{\\text{test}} = 8000$, $\\eta = 0.25$, train seed $= 1337$, test seed $= 2027$.\n  - Choice of $\\alpha$: scan the pruning path and choose the subtree $T_{\\alpha}$ that minimizes the test misclassification rate $r_{\\text{test}}(T_{\\alpha})$. Break ties by choosing the subtree with fewer leaves, and if still tied, choose the one appearing later on the pruning path (corresponding to the larger $\\alpha$). The boolean you must output for this case is\n    $$\n    b_1 = \\big(\\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\text{full}}) = 0\\big) \\wedge \\big(r_{\\text{test}}(T_{\\alpha})  r_{\\text{test}}(T_{\\text{full}})\\big) \\wedge \\big(\\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\alpha})  \\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\text{full}})\\big).\n    $$\n- Test case $2$ (boundary: $\\alpha = 0$ recovers no pruning):\n  - Parameters: $n_{\\text{train}} = 120$, $n_{\\text{test}} = 8000$, $\\eta = 0.25$, train seed $= 1337$, test seed $= 2027$, and $\\alpha = 0$.\n  - The boolean you must output for this case is\n    $$\n    b_2 = \\big(\\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\alpha}) = \\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\text{full}})\\big) \\wedge \\big(r_{\\text{test}}(T_{\\alpha}) = r_{\\text{test}}(T_{\\text{full}})\\big).\n    $$\n- Test case $3$ (edge: very large $\\alpha$ collapses to a stump):\n  - Parameters: $n_{\\text{train}} = 120$, $n_{\\text{test}} = 8000$, $\\eta = 0.25$, train seed $= 1337$, test seed $= 2027$, and $\\alpha = 10.0$.\n  - The boolean you must output for this case is\n    $$\n    b_3 = \\big(|T_{\\alpha}| = 1\\big) \\wedge \\big(\\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\alpha})  \\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\text{full}})\\big).\n    $$\n\nFinal output format:\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order $[b_1,b_2,b_3]$. Each $b_i$ must be a boolean literal. For example, a valid output line is of the form `[True,False,True]`.\n\nNo physical units or angle units are required in this task. All probabilities and rates must be returned as real numbers in [0,1], but only the booleans $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$ must be printed as the final output.", "solution": "The user's request is to develop a Python program that implements a binary classification decision tree from first principles, including the cost-complexity pruning algorithm. The program must then be used to analyze the trade-off between training error and test error on a specified synthetic dataset. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in statistical learning theory, and provides all necessary parameters and definitions for a deterministic and verifiable solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution is architected as a set of interacting components designed to be a faithful implementation of the specified algorithms.\n\n**1. Data Generation**\n\nA function generates the training and test datasets according to the problem's data-generating process. This process is deterministic, relying on pseudo-random number generators seeded with specified integers to ensure reproducibility.\n- The feature space is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, with coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$ drawn independently from a uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$.\n- A true, noise-free class label $y^{\\star}$ is assigned based on a non-linear decision boundary:\n$$\ny^{\\star} = \\mathbf{1}\\{x_1  \\tau(x_2)\\}, \\quad \\text{where } \\tau(u) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(4\\pi u)\n$$\nThis boundary is a sine wave, creating a complex separation task.\n- Label noise is introduced by flipping the true label $y^{\\star}$ with a given probability $\\eta$. An independent seeded random number stream is used for this process to ensure that the noise is independent of the feature generation.\n\n**2. Decision Tree Growth**\n\nThe core of the classifier is a decision tree grown recursively. A `Node` class is used to represent the tree structure. Each node stores information about the data partitioned to it, the split criterion (if it's an internal node), or the prediction value (if it's a leaf).\n\nThe growth algorithm proceeds as follows:\n- **Recursive Partitioning**: Starting with the entire training set at the root node, the algorithm seeks the best axis-aligned split to partition the data.\n- **Split Criterion**: The Gini impurity is used to evaluate the quality of a split. For a set of samples $S$, the Gini impurity is $G(S) = 1 - \\sum_{c \\in \\{0,1\\}} p_c^2$, where $p_c$ is the proportion of samples of class $c$. The algorithm searches over all features and all possible split thresholds to find the split that results in the lowest weighted average Gini impurity of the child nodes. Possible split thresholds are taken as midpoints between consecutive unique feature values.\n- **Stopping and Purity Rule**: The recursion for a branch terminates if a node becomes \"pure\" (contains samples of only one class) or contains only a single sample. Critically, to achieve a training error of zero as specified, if a node is impure but no split reduces the Gini impurity, a split is still forced. This is accomplished by finding the first available feature and separating the first data point from the rest, guaranteeing that the tree will grow until every leaf is pure, effectively memorizing the training data, including the noise. This yields a fully grown tree $T_{\\text{full}}$ with an empirical training misclassification rate $\\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\text{full}}) = 0$.\n\n**3. Cost-Complexity Pruning**\n\nThe fully grown tree $T_{\\text{full}}$ is expected to be overfit to the training data. Cost-complexity pruning is implemented to find a sequence of smaller, potentially better-generalizing subtrees.\n- **Weakest-Link Pruning**: The algorithm generates a sequence of subtrees by iteratively pruning branches. At each step, it identifies the \"weakest link\"—the internal node whose removal leads to the smallest per-leaf increase in misclassification cost.\n- **Pruning Parameter $g(t)$**: For each internal node $t$ in the current tree, a parameter $g(t)$ is calculated:\n$$\ng(t) = \\frac{R(t) - R(T_t)}{L_t - 1}\n$$\nHere, $R(t)$ is the misclassification count on the training data if node $t$ were converted to a leaf, $R(T_t)$ is the total misclassification count of the entire subtree currently rooted at $t$, and $L_t$ is the number of leaves in that subtree.\n- **Path Generation**: The algorithm starts with $T_0 = T_{\\text{full}}$. In step $k$, it computes $g(t)$ for all internal nodes in the current tree $T_{k-1}$. The minimum value found, $\\alpha_k = \\min_t g(t)$, becomes the next threshold in the pruning sequence. A new tree $T_k$ is formed by taking $T_{k-1}$ and converting all nodes $t$ where $g(t) = \\alpha_k$ into leaves. This process is repeated until only the root node remains, yielding a sequence of trees $[T_0, T_1, \\dots, T_m]$ and corresponding a non-decreasing sequence of complexity parameters $[\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_m]$, where $\\alpha_0=0$. Deep copies of tree structures are used to maintain the distinct trees in the sequence.\n\n**4. Evaluation and Test Cases**\n\nThe program then uses the generated data, the full tree, and the pruning path to evaluate the three specified test cases.\n- For a given value of the complexity parameter $\\alpha$, the optimal subtree $T_\\alpha$ is selected from the generated path. The selection rule is to choose the tree $T_k$ from the path such that its corresponding parameter $\\alpha_k$ is the largest value less than or equal to the given $\\alpha$.\n- Misclassification rates for both training and test sets are computed for the relevant trees ($T_{\\text{full}}$ and $T_\\alpha$).\n- **Test Case 1**: This case requires finding the subtree on the pruning path that minimizes the test error. The search iterates through all trees in the path, calculates their test error, and selects the best one according to the specified tie-breaking rules (preferring smaller trees, then larger $\\alpha$). The boolean condition $b_1$ verifies that the full tree overfits ($\\hat r_{\\text{train}}=0$), the pruned tree generalizes better ($r_{\\text{test}}(T_{\\alpha})  r_{\\text{test}}(T_{\\text{full}})$), and that this improvement comes at the cost of training performance ($\\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\alpha})  \\hat r_{\\text{train}}(T_{\\text{full}})$).\n- **Test Case 2**: With $\\alpha=0$, the selection rule must choose the first tree in the path, which is $T_{\\text{full}}$ itself. The boolean condition $b_2$ verifies that the errors of the selected tree are identical to those of the full tree.\n- **Test Case 3**: With a very large $\\alpha=10.0$, the selection rule is expected to choose the most heavily pruned tree, which is the single-leaf root stump.
