A detailed solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem asks for three quantities: the true average treatment effect (ATE), the naive difference in observed means, and the resulting bias.\n\n#### 1. True Average Treatment Effect (ATE)\nThe ATE is the expected value of the difference between the potential outcomes under treatment and control, taken over the entire population.\n$$\n\\text{ATE} = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]\n$$\nSince the potential outcomes depend on the covariate $X$, we can compute this expectation by conditioning on $X$:\n$$\n\\text{ATE} = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) \\mid X=x] P(X=x)\n$$\nGiven that $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ are deterministic functions of $X$, the conditional expectation is simply the value of the function at a given $x$.\nFor $X=0$:\n$Y(0)|_{X=0} = 2 + 0 = 2$\n$Y(1)|_{X=0} = 5 + 3(0) = 5$\nThe treatment effect for this subpopulation is $Y(1)|_{X=0} - Y(0)|_{X=0} = 5 - 2 = 3$.\n\nFor $X=1$:\n$Y(0)|_{X=1} = 2 + 1 = 3$\n$Y(1)|_{X=1} = 5 + 3(1) = 8$\nThe treatment effect for this subpopulation is $Y(1)|_{X=1} - Y(0)|_{X=1} = 8 - 3 = 5$.\n\nThe ATE is the weighted average of these stratum-specific effects, with weights given by the probability of being in each stratum:\n$$\n\\text{ATE} = (3) \\cdot P(X=0) + (5) \\cdot P(X=1)\n$$\nUsing the given distribution $P(X=0) = 0.5$ and $P(X=1) = 0.5$:\n$$\n\\text{ATE} = (3)(0.5) + (5)(0.5) = 1.5 + 2.5 = 4\n$$\n\n#### 2. Naive Difference in Observed Means\nThe naive estimator of the treatment effect is the difference in the mean observed outcomes between the treated and control groups.\n$$\n\\text{Naive Difference} = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=0]\n$$\nUnder SUTVA, for the treated group ($A=1$), the observed outcome is $Y = Y(1)$. For the control group ($A=0$), the observed outcome is $Y = Y(0)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Naive Difference} = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \\mid A=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) \\mid A=0]\n$$\nTo compute these conditional expectations, we need the distribution of the covariate $X$ within each treatment group, i.e., $P(X=x \\mid A=a)$. We use Bayes' theorem. First, we find the marginal probability of treatment, $P(A=1)$:\n$$\nP(A=1) = P(A=1 \\mid X=1)P(X=1) + P(A=1 \\mid X=0)P(X=0)\n$$\n$$\nP(A=1) = (0.99)(0.5) + (0.01)(0.5) = 0.495 + 0.005 = 0.5\n$$\nThe marginal probability of not being treated is $P(A=0) = 1 - P(A=1) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nNow we find the conditional distribution of $X$ given $A=1$:\n$$\nP(X=1 \\mid A=1) = \\frac{P(A=1 \\mid X=1)P(X=1)}{P(A=1)} = \\frac{(0.99)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.99\n$$\n$$\nP(X=0 \\mid A=1) = \\frac{P(A=1 \\mid X=0)P(X=0)}{P(A=1)} = \\frac{(0.01)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.01\n$$\nThe expected outcome for the treated group is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \\mid A=1] = (Y(1)|_{X=1}) P(X=1 \\mid A=1) + (Y(1)|_{X=0}) P(X=0 \\mid A=1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \\mid A=1] = (8)(0.99) + (5)(0.01) = 7.92 + 0.05 = 7.97\n$$\nNext, we find the conditional distribution of $X$ given $A=0$:\n$$\nP(X=1 \\mid A=0) = \\frac{P(A=0 \\mid X=1)P(X=1)}{P(A=0)} = \\frac{(1 - 0.99)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.01\n$$\n$$\nP(X=0 \\mid A=0) = \\frac{P(A=0 \\mid X=0)P(X=0)}{P(A=0)} = \\frac{(1 - 0.01)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.99\n$$\nThe expected outcome for the control group is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(0) \\mid A=0] = (Y(0)|_{X=1}) P(X=1 \\mid A=0) + (Y(0)|_{X=0}) P(X=0 \\mid A=0)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(0) \\mid A=0] = (3)(0.01) + (2)(0.99) = 0.03 + 1.98 = 2.01\n$$\nThe naive difference in means is:\n$$\n\\text{Naive Difference} = 7.97 - 2.01 = 5.96\n$$\n\n#### 3. Bias Calculation\nThe bias is defined as the difference between the naive estimator and the true ATE.\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = (\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=0]) - \\text{ATE}\n$$\nPlugging in the calculated values:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = 5.96 - 4 = 1.96\n$$\nThis positive bias arises because the treatment assignment is strongly correlated with the covariate $X$, which is itself a determinant of the potential outcomes. This phenomenon is known as confounding. Specifically, individuals with $X=1$, who have higher potential outcomes under both treatment and control, are much more likely to be treated.

It represents a standard and important concept in the analysis of observational data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the E-value formula. We start from the relationship between the observed risk ratio ($\\widehat{RR}$), the true causal risk ratio ($RR^{\\text{causal}}$), and the bias factor ($B$) from an unmeasured confounder $U$. For an observed risk ratio $\\widehat{RR} > 1$, this relationship is $\\widehat{RR} = RR^{\\text{causal}} \\times B$.\n\nTo \"explain away\" an observed effect means finding a confounding structure that makes the observed $\\widehat{RR}$ compatible with a true causal risk ratio of $1$. Setting $RR^{\\text{causal}} = 1$, the relationship becomes $\\widehat{RR} = B$. Thus, to explain away the effect, the bias factor must be equal to the observed risk ratio.\n\nThe E-value is defined based on two parameters: $RR_{AU}$, the risk ratio for the association between the confounder $U$ and the treatment $A$, and $RR_{UY}$, the risk ratio for the association between $U$ and the outcome $Y$. The E-value is the minimum value $E$ such that if both $RR_{AU}$ and $RR_{UY}$ were equal to $E$, they could produce a bias factor of at least $\\widehat{RR}$.\n\nA well-established result provides a sharp upper bound on the bias factor: $B \\le \\frac{RR_{AU} \\cdot RR_{UY}}{RR_{AU} + RR_{UY} - 1}$. To find the minimal required strength $E$, we set $RR_{AU} = RR_{UY} = E$ and solve for the case where the bias factor equals the observed risk ratio:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{E \\cdot E}{E + E - 1} = \\frac{E^2}{2E - 1} $$\nRearranging this equation gives a quadratic equation in $E$:\n$$ \\widehat{RR}(2E - 1) = E^2 $$\n$$ 2E\\widehat{RR} - \\widehat{RR} = E^2 $$\n$$ E^2 - 2E\\widehat{RR} + \\widehat{RR} = 0 $$\nWe can solve for $E$ using the quadratic formula, $E = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR} \\pm \\sqrt{(-2\\widehat{RR})^2 - 4(1)(\\widehat{RR})}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR} \\pm \\sqrt{4\\widehat{RR}^2 - 4\\widehat{RR}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR} \\pm 2\\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}^2 - \\widehat{RR}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\widehat{RR} \\pm \\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}(\\widehat{RR} - 1)} $$\nSince the E-value represents a risk ratio, it must be greater than or equal to $1$. For an observed $\\widehat{RR} > 1$, the larger of the two roots is the one that satisfies this condition and represents the minimal strength of confounding required. Therefore, the derived expression for the E-value is:\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\widehat{RR} + \\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}(\\widehat{RR} - 1)} $$\n\nNow, we compute the E-value for $\\widehat{RR} = 1.8$:\n$$ E = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.8(1.8 - 1)} $$\n$$ E = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.8 \\times 0.8} $$\n$$ E = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.44} $$\n$$ E = 1.8 + 1.2 = 3.0 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the E-value is $3.000$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. An E-value of $3.000$ for an observed risk ratio of $1.8$ means that for an unmeasured confounder to fully explain away this observed association (i.e., to reduce the true causal risk ratio to $1.0$), it would need to be associated with both the treatment and the outcome with risk ratios of at least $3.0$ each, above and beyond the measured covariates. For instance, the confounder would have to increase the risk of the outcome by a factor of $3.0$ and be $3.0$ times more prevalent in the treated group than the untreated group. The plausibility of the confounding explanation can be assessed by comparing this required strength of association ($E=3.0$) with the strengths of known and established risk factors for the given treatment and outcome. If such strong confounding is considered implausible, the inference of a causal effect is more robust.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.000}\n$$", "id": "3110463"}]}
