{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey into PAC learning begins with a solid grasp of its foundational concepts: shattering, Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension, and breakpoints. This first practice is designed to build your intuition by connecting abstract theory to tangible results. You will derive the theoretical VC dimension and breakpoint for several classic hypothesis classes and then write a program to empirically verify where the \"shattering\" property breaks down, solidifying your understanding of how a model's capacity is formally measured. [@problem_id:3161849]", "problem": "Consider four hypothesis classes $H$ in the context of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning and Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension: thresholds on the real line, intervals on the real line, linear separators in two-dimensional Euclidean space, and axis-aligned rectangles in two-dimensional Euclidean space. The fundamental base for this problem consists of the core definitions of shattering, growth function, VC dimension, and breakpoint. The definitions are as follows: a hypothesis class $H$ shatters a finite set $S$ if for every labeling of $S$ there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that realizes that labeling; the growth function $m_H(m)$ is the maximum number of distinct labelings that $H$ can realize on any set of size $m$; the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension $d$ of $H$ is the largest $m$ for which there exists a set of size $m$ that is shattered by $H$; the breakpoint $k$ of $H$ is the smallest integer $m$ such that $m_H(m)  2^m$, equivalently, such that no set of size $m$ can be shattered by $H$. Starting from these definitions, derive the theoretical breakpoints for the four classes below by reasoning from first principles (without using shortcut formulas), and then implement a program that empirically verifies the transition where shattering fails.\n\nHypothesis classes:\n- Thresholds on $\\mathbb{R}$: $H_{\\mathrm{thr}} = \\{ h_t(x) = \\mathbf{1}[x \\ge t] : t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$.\n- Intervals on $\\mathbb{R}$: $H_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\{ h_{a,b}(x) = \\mathbf{1}[a \\le x \\le b] : a \\le b,\\, a,b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$.\n- Linear separators on $\\mathbb{R}^2$: $H_{\\mathrm{lin}} = \\{ h_{w,b}(x) = \\mathbf{1}[w^\\top x + b \\ge 0] : w \\in \\mathbb{R}^2,\\, b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$.\n- Axis-aligned rectangles on $\\mathbb{R}^2$: $H_{\\mathrm{rect}} = \\{ h_A(x) = \\mathbf{1}[x \\in [a_x,b_x]\\times[a_y,b_y]] : a_x \\le b_x,\\, a_y \\le b_y,\\, a_x,a_y,b_x,b_y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using only the fundamental definitions stated above, reason to determine the VC dimension $d$ and the theoretical breakpoint $k$ for each of the four classes $H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$, $H_{\\mathrm{int}}$, $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}$, and $H_{\\mathrm{rect}}$.\n2. Construct concrete datasets to empirically reveal the transition from shattering to failure, at sizes $m = d$ and $m = k$, for each class. Use the following deterministic datasets:\n   - For $H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$: at $m=d$ use $X^{\\mathrm{thr}}_d = [\\,0\\,]$; at $m=k$ use $X^{\\mathrm{thr}}_k = [\\,0,\\,1\\,]$.\n   - For $H_{\\mathrm{int}}$: at $m=d$ use $X^{\\mathrm{int}}_d = [\\,0,\\,1\\,]$; at $m=k$ use $X^{\\mathrm{int}}_k = [\\,0,\\,1,\\,2\\,]$.\n   - For $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}$: at $m=d$ use $X^{\\mathrm{lin}}_d = [\\,(0,0),\\,(1,0),\\,(0,1)\\,]$; at $m=k$ use $X^{\\mathrm{lin}}_k = [\\,(0,0),\\,(1,0),\\,(1,1),\\,(0,1)\\,]$.\n   - For $H_{\\mathrm{rect}}$: at $m=d$ use $X^{\\mathrm{rect}}_d = [\\,(1,0),\\,(-1,0),\\,(0,1),\\,(0,-1)\\,]$; at $m=k$ use $X^{\\mathrm{rect}}_k = [\\,(1,0),\\,(-1,0),\\,(0,1),\\,(0,-1),\\,(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})\\,]$.\n   All coordinates are in standard Euclidean units (unitless real numbers).\n3. For each class $H$ and each dataset $X$, empirically test whether $X$ is shattered by $H$ by exhaustively enumerating all $2^{|X|}$ labelings of $X$ and deciding for each labeling whether there exists a hypothesis in $H$ that realizes it. Your decision procedures must be designed directly from the definitions and the geometric or order structure of each class, without invoking external black-box learning packages.\n4. From the empirical results on the two datasets $(X_d, X_k)$ for each class, define the empirical breakpoint $\\hat{k}$ as the smallest tested $m \\in \\{\\,|X_d|,\\,|X_k|\\,\\}$ for which shattering fails. If both tested sets are shattered (which should not occur for correctly chosen datasets), set $\\hat{k}$ to the larger of the tested sizes.\n5. Compare the theoretical breakpoint $k$ with the empirical breakpoint $\\hat{k}$ for each class.\n\nTest suite and output specification:\n- Use the four classes and their datasets specified above as the test suite.\n- For each class, assign an integer identifier: $0$ for thresholds on $\\mathbb{R}$, $1$ for intervals on $\\mathbb{R}$, $2$ for linear separators on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and $3$ for axis-aligned rectangles on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n- Your program should compute, for each class, a result list $[\\,\\mathrm{id},\\,k,\\,S_d,\\,S_k,\\,\\hat{k},\\,A\\,]$, where $\\mathrm{id}$ is the integer identifier, $k$ is the theoretical breakpoint, $S_d$ is a boolean indicating whether $X_d$ is shattered, $S_k$ is a boolean indicating whether $X_k$ is shattered, $\\hat{k}$ is the empirical breakpoint as defined above, and $A$ is a boolean stating whether $k = \\hat{k}$.\n- Final output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the four classes as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each class’s result must itself be a bracketed list. The overall format is thus $[\\,[\\mathrm{id},k,S_d,S_k,\\hat{k},A],\\,[\\mathrm{id},k,S_d,S_k,\\hat{k},A],\\,[\\mathrm{id},k,S_d,S_k,\\hat{k},A],\\,[\\mathrm{id},k,S_d,S_k,\\hat{k},A]\\,]$. Booleans must be printed as $True$ or $False$, integers as base-$10$ numerals.", "solution": "The problem of determining the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and breakpoint for various hypothesis classes is a foundational exercise in statistical learning theory. The solution requires a two-pronged approach: a theoretical derivation from first principles and an empirical verification through computation.\n\nThe definitions provided are standard:\n- A hypothesis class $H$ **shatters** a set $S$ if it can realize all $2^{|S|}$ possible binary labelings of the points in $S$.\n- The **growth function** $m_H(m)$ is the maximum number of dichotomies (labelings) induced by $H$ on any set of $m$ points.\n- The **VC dimension** $d = \\mathrm{VCdim}(H)$ is the size of the largest set that can be shattered by $H$. Formally, $d = \\max \\{ m : m_H(m) = 2^m \\}$.\n- The **breakpoint** $k$ is the smallest integer $m$ for which no set of size $m$ can be shattered by $H$. Formally, $k = \\min \\{ m : m_H(m)  2^m \\}$.\nFrom these definitions, it follows directly that the breakpoint $k$ is equal to the VC dimension plus one, i.e., $k=d+1$. The reasoning is that $d$ is the largest size that *can* be shattered, so $d+1$ must be the smallest size that *cannot* be shattered. We will derive both $d$ and $k$ from first principles for each class.\n\n### 1. Class $H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$: Thresholds on $\\mathbb{R}$\n$H_{\\mathrm{thr}} = \\{ h_t(x) = \\mathbf{1}[x \\ge t] : t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$. A hypothesis in this class labels all points to the right of a threshold $t$ as positive ($1$) and all points to the left as negative ($0$).\n\n**Theoretical Analysis ($d$ and $k$)**\n- **VC Dimension ($d$):**\n  - **Show $d \\ge 1$**: We must find a set of size $m=1$ that can be shattered. Let $S = \\{x_1\\}$. There are $2^1=2$ labelings: $\\{0\\}$ and $\\{1\\}$.\n    - Labeling $\\{1\\}$: We need $\\mathbf{1}[x_1 \\ge t] = 1$, which requires $x_1 \\ge t$. We can choose $t = x_1$.\n    - Labeling $\\{0\\}$: We need $\\mathbf{1}[x_1 \\ge t] = 0$, which requires $x_1  t$. We can choose $t = x_1 + \\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n    Since both labelings can be realized, any set of size $1$ is shattered. Thus, $d \\ge 1$.\n  - **Show $d  2$**: We must show that *no* set of size $m=2$ can be shattered. Let $S = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$ be any set of two distinct points. Without loss of generality, assume $x_1  x_2$. There are $2^2=4$ possible labelings: $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$.\n    - Labeling $(0,0)$: Choose $t > x_2$. Then $x_1  t$ and $x_2  t$, so $h_t(x_1)=0, h_t(x_2)=0$. Realizable.\n    - Labeling $(0,1)$: Choose $x_1  t \\le x_2$. Then $x_1  t$ and $x_2 \\ge t$, so $h_t(x_1)=0, h_t(x_2)=1$. Realizable.\n    - Labeling $(1,1)$: Choose $t \\le x_1$. Then $x_1 \\ge t$ and $x_2 \\ge t$, so $h_t(x_1)=1, h_t(x_2)=1$. Realizable.\n    - Labeling $(1,0)$: We would need $h_t(x_1)=1$ and $h_t(x_2)=0$. This implies $x_1 \\ge t$ and $x_2  t$. Combining these gives $x_2  t \\le x_1$, which contradicts our assumption that $x_1  x_2$. This labeling is impossible to realize.\n  Since there exists a labeling that cannot be realized for any set of size $2$, no set of size $2$ can be shattered. Therefore, $d  2$.\n  - **Conclusion**: From $d \\ge 1$ and $d  2$, we conclude that the VC dimension is $d=1$.\n\n- **Breakpoint ($k$)**: The breakpoint $k$ is the smallest integer $m$ such that no set of size $m$ can be shattered. As we have just shown, $m=2$ is the smallest such size. Therefore, the breakpoint is $k=2$. This is consistent with $k=d+1$.\n\n**Empirical Verification Logic**\nA labeling $y$ of a set $X$ is realizable by $H_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ if there exists a threshold $t$ such that $\\mathbf{1}[x_i \\ge t] = y_i$ for all $(x_i, y_i)$. Let $X_+ = \\{x_i | y_i=1\\}$ and $X_- = \\{x_i | y_i=0\\}$. The condition is equivalent to finding a $t$ such that $t \\le x_i$ for all $x_i \\in X_+$ and $t > x_j$ for all $x_j \\in X_-$. This is possible if and only if $\\max(X_-)  \\min(X_+)$. (If $X_-$ is empty, we define $\\max(X_-)=-\\infty$; if $X_+$ is empty, we define $\\min(X_+)=\\infty$.) To test for shattering, we generate all $2^{|X|}$ labelings and check if this condition holds for each.\n\n### 2. Class $H_{\\mathrm{int}}$: Intervals on $\\mathbb{R}$\n$H_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\{ h_{a,b}(x) = \\mathbf{1}[a \\le x \\le b] : a \\le b,\\, a,b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$. Hypotheses in this class label points inside an interval $[a,b]$ as positive.\n\n**Theoretical Analysis ($d$ and $k$)**\n- **VC Dimension ($d$):**\n  - **Show $d \\ge 2$**: We must find a set of size $m=2$ that can be shattered. Let $S = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with $x_1  x_2$.\n    - Labeling $(0,0)$: Choose $[a,b]$ disjoint from $S$, e.g., $b  x_1$.\n    - Labeling $(1,0)$: Choose $[a,b]$ to contain only $x_1$, e.g., $a=b=x_1$.\n    - Labeling $(0,1)$: Choose $[a,b]$ to contain only $x_2$, e.g., $a=b=x_2$.\n    - Labeling $(1,1)$: Choose $[a,b]$ to contain both, e.g., $a=x_1, b=x_2$.\n    All $4$ labelings are realizable. Thus, $d \\ge 2$.\n  - **Show $d  3$**: We must show that *no* set of size $m=3$ can be shattered. Let $S = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ with $x_1  x_2  x_3$. Consider the labeling $(1,0,1)$. To realize this, we need a single interval $[a,b]$ such that $x_1 \\in [a,b]$, $x_3 \\in [a,b]$, and $x_2 \\notin [a,b]$. For an interval, if it contains two points $x_1$ and $x_3$, it must contain all points between them. Since $x_1  x_2  x_3$, any interval containing $x_1$ and $x_3$ must also contain $x_2$. This contradicts the requirement that $x_2$ is labeled $0$. Thus, the labeling $(1,0,1)$ is not realizable.\n  Since there exists a labeling that cannot be realized for any set of size $3$, no set of size $3$ can be shattered. Therefore, $d  3$.\n  - **Conclusion**: From $d \\ge 2$ and $d  3$, we conclude that the VC dimension is $d=2$.\n\n- **Breakpoint ($k$)**: The breakpoint $k$ is the smallest $m$ for which no set of size $m$ can be shattered. We have shown this is $m=3$. Therefore, the breakpoint is $k=3$. This is consistent with $k=d+1$.\n\n**Empirical Verification Logic**\nA labeling $y$ of a set $X$ is realizable by $H_{\\mathrm{int}}$ if the positive points are \"consecutive\" on the real line. Let $X_+ = \\{x_i | y_i=1\\}$ and $X_- = \\{x_i | y_i=0\\}$. The labeling is realizable if we can find an interval $[a,b]$ containing all of $X_+$ but none of $X_-$. The tightest such interval is $[\\min(X_+), \\max(X_+)]$. The labeling is realizable if and only if no point from $X_-$ falls within this interval. (If $|X_+|\\le 1$, it is always realizable).\n\n### 3. Class $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}$: Linear Separators on $\\mathbb{R}^2$\n$H_{\\mathrm{lin}} = \\{ h_{w,b}(x) = \\mathbf{1}[w^\\top x + b \\ge 0] : w \\in \\mathbb{R}^2,\\, b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$. Hypotheses in this class are half-planes.\n\n**Theoretical Analysis ($d$ and $k$)**\n- **VC Dimension ($d$):**\n  - **Show $d \\ge 3$**: We must find a set of size $m=3$ that can be shattered. Let $S$ be a set of $3$ non-collinear points, for instance, the vertices of a triangle. Any partitioning of these $3$ points into two sets (positive and negative) can be achieved with a line.\n    - Labeling $(0,0,0)$ or $(1,1,1)$: Trivial (e.g., a line far away from all points).\n    - Labeling with one point of one class and two of another (e.g., $(1,0,0)$): A line can be drawn that separates the single point from the other two.\n    Since all $2^3=8$ labelings can be realized, any set of $3$ non-collinear points can be shattered. Thus, $d \\ge 3$.\n  - **Show $d  4$**: We must show that *no* set of size $m=4$ can be shattered. Let $S$ be any set of $4$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. By Radon's Theorem, any set of $d+2=4$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be partitioned into two subsets, $S_1$ and $S_2$, whose convex hulls intersect.\n    - Case 1: The points form a convex quadrilateral. Let the points be $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ in order around the perimeter. Consider the labeling that assigns labels $1,0,1,0$ respectively. The set of positive points is $X_+ = \\{p_1,p_3\\}$ and the set of negative points is $X_- = \\{p_2,p_4\\}$. For a linear separator to exist, the convex hulls of $X_+$ and $X_-$ must be disjoint. Here, $\\mathrm{conv}(X_+)$ is the line segment connecting $p_1$ and $p_3$, and $\\mathrm{conv}(X_-)$ is the line segment connecting $p_2$ and $p_4$. These are the diagonals of the quadrilateral, which must intersect. Since their convex hulls intersect, no line can separate them.\n    - Case 2: One point lies inside the convex hull (triangle) of the other three. Let $p_4$ be inside the triangle formed by $p_1,p_2,p_3$. Consider the labeling that assigns label $0$ to $p_4$ and $1$ to $p_1,p_2,p_3$. Any half-plane containing $p_1,p_2,p_3$ must contain their convex hull (the triangle). Since $p_4$ is inside the triangle, it must also be in the half-plane and thus be labeled $1$, which is a contradiction.\n    In either case, there is a labeling that cannot be realized. Thus, no set of $4$ points can be shattered. Therefore, $d  4$.\n  - **Conclusion**: From $d \\ge 3$ and $d  4$, we conclude that the VC dimension is $d=3$.\n\n- **Breakpoint ($k$)**: The breakpoint is the smallest integer $m$ such that no set of size $m$ can be shattered. We showed this is $m=4$. Therefore, the breakpoint is $k=4$.\n\n**Empirical Verification Logic**\nA labeling is realizable if the set of positive points $X_+$ can be separated from the set of negative points $X_-$ by a line. This is true if and only if $\\mathrm{conv}(X_+) \\cap \\mathrm{conv}(X_-) = \\emptyset$. For the small number of points in the test sets, we can check this geometrically.\n- For $m=3$ non-collinear points, any partition into $X_+$ and $X_-$ results in disjoint convex hulls (a point and a line segment, or one set being empty). They are always separable.\n- For $m=4$, we must check partitions. If $|X_+|=2, |X_-|=2$, we check if two line segments intersect. If $|X_+|=1, |X_-|=3$, we check if a point lies inside a triangle.\n\n### 4. Class $H_{\\mathrm{rect}}$: Axis-Aligned Rectangles on $\\mathbb{R}^2$\n$H_{\\mathrm{rect}} = \\{ h_A(x) = \\mathbf{1}[x \\in [a_x,b_x]\\times[a_y,b_y]] \\}$. Hypotheses are axis-aligned rectangles.\n\n**Theoretical Analysis ($d$ and $k$)**\n- **VC Dimension ($d$):**\n  - **Show $d \\ge 4$**: We must find a set of size $m=4$ that can be shattered. Consider the set $S = \\{(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)\\}$. This configuration of points, resembling a diamond, can be shattered. For any subset of points to be labeled positive, we can construct an axis-aligned rectangle containing exactly that subset. For instance, to realize the labeling $(1,1,0,0)$ on points $((1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1))$, we need to contain just the first two points. The rectangle $[-1,1] \\times [-\\epsilon, \\epsilon]$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$ works. The most challenging case is often a \"checkerboard\" pattern. Let's label $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ as positive, and $(-1,0)$ and $(0,-1)$ as negative. The minimal bounding box for the positive points is $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$. This rectangle does not contain the negative points. Thus, this labeling is realizable. One can verify all $16$ labelings are possible. So $d \\ge 4$.\n  - **Show $d  5$**: We must show that no set of size $m=5$ can be shattered. Given any set $S$ of $5$ points, find the points with the minimum and maximum $x$ and $y$ coordinates. These points define a minimal bounding box for the entire set $S$. There must be at least one point in $S$ that is not on this \"outer edge\" (i.e., it has neither the minimum/maximum $x$ nor the minimum/maximum $y$ coordinate among the points in $S$). Let's call such a point an \"interior\" point. Consider the labeling that assigns $1$ to all non-interior (\"exterior\") points and $0$ to all interior points. For a hypothesis (an axis-aligned rectangle) to classify the exterior points as positive, it must contain all of them. Any such rectangle must therefore contain the minimal bounding box of these exterior points, which is the same as the minimal bounding box of the entire set $S$. This box, by definition, also contains all interior points. The hypothesis would thus label the interior points as $1$, contradicting the desired labeling of $0$.\n  Therefore, no set of size $5$ can be shattered. So, $d  5$.\n  - **Conclusion**: From $d \\ge 4$ and $d  5$, we conclude that the VC dimension is $d=4$.\n\n- **Breakpoint ($k$)**: The breakpoint is the smallest integer $m$ such that no set of size $m$ can be shattered. We showed this is $m=5$. Therefore, the breakpoint is $k=5$.\n\n**Empirical Verification Logic**\nA labeling $y$ of a set $X$ is realizable if there exists an axis-aligned rectangle containing all positive points $X_+$ and no negative points $X_-$. The smallest such rectangle is the minimal axis-aligned bounding box of $X_+$, let's call it $R_{min}$. A labeling is realizable if and only if no point in $X_-$ is contained in $R_{min}$. (If $X_+$ is empty, it's always realizable).\n\n### Summary of Theoretical Results\n| ID | Class Name                | VC Dimension ($d$) | Breakpoint ($k$) |\n|----|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| 0  | Thresholds on $\\mathbb{R}$      | $1$                | $2$              |\n| 1  | Intervals on $\\mathbb{R}$       | $2$                | $3$              |\n| 2  | Lin.

Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem in statistical learning theory. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a hypothesis class is the maximum number of points that the class can shatter. We need to find the size $m$ of the largest set $S = \\{(x_1, k_1), \\dots, (x_m, k_m)\\}$ that can be shattered by $\\mathcal{G}$. A set $S$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{G}$ if for any possible labeling $(y_1, \\dots, y_m) \\in \\{-1, +1\\}^m$, there exists a hypothesis $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$ such that $g(x_i, k_i) = y_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$.\n\nA hypothesis $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$ is specified by a tuple of $K$ independent hypotheses $(h_1, \\dots, h_K)$, where each $h_j \\in \\mathcal{H}$. The defining property of $g$ is that $g(x_i, k_i) = h_{k_i}(x_i)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the VC dimension of the base class $\\mathcal{H}$. The class $\\mathcal{H}$ is the set of affine hyperplanes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. An affine hyperplane is defined by $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d : \\mathbf{w}^\\top x + b = 0\\}$. This is equivalent to a homogeneous hyperplane in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ by mapping $x \\mapsto (x, 1)$ and using the weight vector $(\\mathbf{w}, b)$. The VC dimension of homogeneous hyperplanes in a $p$-dimensional space is $p$. Here, $p = d+1$. Therefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{H}$ is a known result:\n$$\n\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}) = d+1\n$$\n\nNow, we will determine $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G})$ by establishing a lower bound and an upper bound.\n\n**Lower Bound for $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G})$**\n\nTo show $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G}) \\ge K(d+1)$, we must construct a set of size $K(d+1)$ that can be shattered by $\\mathcal{G}$.\nLet $D_{\\mathcal{H}} = \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}) = d+1$.\nFor each class index $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$, we can find a set of $D_{\\mathcal{H}}$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, let's call it $S'_j = \\{x_{j,1}, \\dots, x_{j, D_{\\mathcal{H}}}\\}$, that is shattered by $\\mathcal{H}$. We can choose these $K$ sets of points to be disjoint from each other.\n\nNow, construct a set of points $S$ in the expanded domain $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$ as follows:\n$$\nS = \\bigcup_{j=1}^{K} \\{ (x, j) \\mid x \\in S'_j \\}\n$$\nThe size of this set is $|S| = \\sum_{j=1}^{K} |S'_j| = K \\cdot D_{\\mathcal{H}} = K(d+1)$.\n\nWe must show that $S$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{G}$. Consider an arbitrary labeling of the points in $S$, denoted by $\\{y_{j,i} \\in \\{-1,+1\\}\\}$ for $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$ and $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,D_{\\mathcal{H}}\\}$. We need to find a hypothesis $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$, which corresponds to a tuple $(h_1, \\dots, h_K) \\in \\mathcal{H}^K$, such that for every point $(x_{j,i}, j) \\in S$, we have $g(x_{j,i}, j) = y_{j,i}$.\nThis condition is $h_j(x_{j,i}) = y_{j,i}$.\n\nLet's look at the requirements for each $h_j$ independently.\n- For $j=1$, we need to find $h_1 \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $h_1(x_{1,i}) = y_{1,i}$ for all $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,D_{\\mathcal{H}}\\}$. This is a labeling of the set $S'_1$. Since $S'_1$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{H}$, such an $h_1$ is guaranteed to exist.\n- For $j=2$, we need to find $h_2 \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $h_2(x_{2,i}) = y_{2,i}$ for all $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,D_{\\mathcal{H}}\\}$. Since $S'_2$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{H}$, such an $h_2$ is guaranteed to exist.\n- ...\n- For $j=K$, we need to find $h_K \\in \\mathcal{H}$ that realizes the given labeling on $S'_K$. Since $S'_K$ is shattered, such an $h_K$ exists.\n\nSince we can choose each $h_j$ independently from $\\mathcal{H}$ to satisfy the conditions on its corresponding point set $S'_j$, we can construct the tuple $(h_1, \\dots, h_K)$ that defines a $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$ satisfying the entire labeling for $S$. As this holds for any arbitrary labeling of $S$, the set $S$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{G}$.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G}) \\ge |S| = K(d+1)$.\n\n**Upper Bound for $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G})$**\n\nLet $S = \\{(x_1, k_1), \\dots, (x_m, k_m)\\}$ be any set of $m$ points in the domain of $\\mathcal{G}$ that is shattered by $\\mathcal{G}$. Let's partition $S$ based on the class index $k$. For each $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$, define the set of x-coordinates:\n$$\nS_j = \\{ x_i \\mid (x_i, k_i) \\in S \\text{ and } k_i = j \\}\n$$\nLet $m_j = |S_j|$. Then the total size of $S$ is $m = \\sum_{j=1}^{K} m_j$.\n\nThe number of dichotomies that a hypothesis class $\\mathcal{F}$ can induce on a set $Z$ is denoted by its growth function, $\\Pi_{\\mathcal{F}}(Z)$. If a set $S$ of size $m$ is shattered, then $|\\Pi_{\\mathcal{G}}(S)| = 2^m$.\n\nA dichotomy on $S$ induced by $g=(h_1, \\dots, h_K) \\in \\mathcal{G}$ is the vector of labels $(h_{k_1}(x_1), \\dots, h_{k_m}(x_m))$. The label for a point $(x_i, k_i)$ where $k_i=j$ depends only on the choice of $h_j$. Since the hypotheses $h_1, \\dots, h_K$ are chosen independently, the set of all possible dichotomies on $S$ is the Cartesian product of the sets of dichotomies that can be realized on each subset $S_j$ by $\\mathcal{H}$.\nThus, the growth function of $\\mathcal{G}$ on $S$ factorizes:\n$$\n|\\Pi_{\\mathcal{G}}(S)| = \\prod_{j=1}^{K} |\\Pi_{\\mathcal{H}}(S_j)|\n$$\nIf $S$ is shattered by $\\mathcal{G}$, we must have $|\\Pi_{\\mathcal{G}}(S)| = 2^m = 2^{\\sum m_j} = \\prod_{j=1}^K 2^{m_j}$.\nCombining these facts gives:\n$$\n\\prod_{j=1}^{K} |\\Pi_{\\mathcal{H}}(S_j)| = \\prod_{j=1}^{K} 2^{m_j}\n$$\nAccording to Sauer's Lemma, for any set $S_j$ of size $m_j$, we have $|\\Pi_{\\mathcal{H}}(S_j)| \\le 2^{m_j}$. The equality above can thus only hold if $|\\Pi_{\\mathcal{H}}(S_j)| = 2^{m_j}$ for all $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$.\n\nThe condition $|\\Pi_{\\mathcal{H}}(S_j)| = 2^{m_j}$ means that the set $S_j$ must be shattered by the base class $\\mathcal{H}$. By the definition of VC dimension, any set of size greater than $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H})$ cannot be shattered. Therefore, for each $j$, we must have:\n$$\nm_j = |S_j| \\le \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}) = d+1\n$$\nThe total size of the shattered set $S$ is then bounded by:\n$$\nm = \\sum_{j=1}^{K} m_j \\le \\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}) = K(d+1)\n$$\nThis shows that any set shattered by $\\mathcal{G}$ can have a size of at most $K(d+1)$. By definition of VC dimension, this means $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G}) \\le K(d+1)$.\n\n**Conclusion on VC Dimension**\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we have shown:\n$$\nK(d+1) \\le \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G}) \\le K(d+1)\n$$\nThis establishes the exact value for the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{G}$.\n\n### Step 3: Sample Complexity Scaling\n\nThe question asks how the sample complexity for a simultaneous generalization guarantee scales with the derived VC dimension. By framing the OvR task as a single binary classification problem over the expanded domain $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\{1, \\dots, K\\}$ with the hypothesis class $\\mathcal{G}$, we can directly apply standard uniform convergence bounds from PAC learning theory.\n\nFor a binary hypothesis class $\\mathcal{F}$ with VC dimension $d_{\\mathcal{F}}$, a sample of size $m$ is sufficient to guarantee that with probability at least $1-\\delta$, the true error $R(h)$ and empirical error $\\hat{R}(h)$ for all $h \\in \\mathcal{F}$ satisfy $|R(h) - \\hat{R}(h)| \\le \\varepsilon$. The sample complexity $m$ has the following scaling behavior (ignoring logarithmic factors in $m, \\varepsilon, d$):\n$$\nm(\\varepsilon, \\delta) = O\\left( \\frac{d_{\\mathcal{F}} + \\log(1/\\delta)}{\\varepsilon^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis bound provides a uniform guarantee over the entire class $\\mathcal{F}$, ensuring that whichever hypothesis is learned (e.g., via Empirical Risk Minimization), its generalization error is controlled.\n\nIn our case, the learning problem is defined over the hypothesis class $\\mathcal{G}$. A guarantee that is uniform over all $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$ is a guarantee that is uniform over all possible tuples of OvR classifiers $(h_1, \\dots, h_K)$. This can be interpreted as holding \"simultaneously\" for all $K$ binary problems in the sense that the guarantee applies to the entire learned system $g = (h_1, \\dots, h_K)$.\n\nTo determine the sample complexity scaling, we substitute $d_{\\mathcal{F}}$ with $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G})$:\n$$\nm(\\varepsilon, \\delta) = O\\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{G}) + \\log(1/\\delta)}{\\varepsilon^2} \\right) = O\\left( \\frac{K(d+1) + \\log(1/\\delta)}{\\varepsilon^2} \\right)\n$$\nThus, the sample complexity scales linearly with the number of classes $K$ and linearly with the input dimension $d$. It also exhibits the standard scaling of $O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ with the accuracy parameter $\\varepsilon$ and $O(\\log(1/\\delta))$ with the confidence parameter $\\delta$.\n\nThe final answer required is the closed-form expression for the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{G}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{K(d+1)}$$", "id": "3192466"}, {"introduction": "While the VC dimension provides a fundamental and elegant theory of generalization, it is not the only tool available, and its resulting bounds can sometimes be loose.

Do not rely on any shortcut formulas in designing the method; derive each bound from the standard definitions and facts stated here and applicable to binary classification and finite hypothesis classes.\n\nExperiment design:\n- Hypothesis class: Consider threshold classifiers on the real line with both polarities. Let $H$ be the class consisting of hypotheses that split $\\mathbb{R}$ at a cut $(k)$, $k \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m\\}$, where $m$ is the sample size for the current test case. For any threshold index $k$, define two hypotheses: $h_{k}^{+}$ that predicts $-1$ on the first $k$ sorted points and $+1$ on the remaining $m-k$ points, and $h_{k}^{-}$ that predicts $+1$ on the first $k$ points and $-1$ on the remaining points. This yields a finite class of size $|H| = 2(m+1)$. The Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension (VC) of thresholds on the real line is $d = 1$.\n\n- Data distribution and dataset construction: For a given sample size $m$, construct a deterministic dataset $S_{m} = \\{(x_{i}, y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{m}$ with $x_{i} = \\frac{i}{m+1}$ for each $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,m\\}$, and labels $y_{i} \\in \\{-1,+1\\}$ defined by $y_{i} = \\text{sign}(x_{i} - \\theta)$ with $\\theta = 0.6$. To avoid trivial separability and to make the empirical error non-zero at some sample sizes, introduce label noise deterministically by flipping $y_{i}$ whenever $i$ is divisible by $4$ (i.e., replace $y_{i}$ by $-y_{i}$ if $4$ divides $i$).

Rademacher complexity bound: Using the finite class $H$ taking values in $\\{-1,+1\\}$, derive a bound on the true risk $L(h)$ in terms of $L_{\\hat{S}_{m}}(h)$, the sample size $m$, a confidence parameter $\\delta$, and an upper bound on the empirical Rademacher complexity of $H$ based on its cardinality $|H|$ for functions bounded in $[-1,1]$.\n  3. Probably Approximately Correct–Bayesian (PAC-Bayes) bound: Using a uniform prior $P$ over $H$ and a posterior $Q$ that is a point mass on the ERM hypothesis $h^{*}$, derive an upper bound on the Gibbs classifier’s true risk $L(Q)$ in terms of $L_{\\hat{S}_{m}}(Q)$, the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence $\\mathrm{KL}(Q \\| P)$, the sample size $m$, and a confidence parameter $\\delta$.\n\n- Confidence parameter: Use $\\delta = 0.05$ for all test cases.\n\nRequired computational steps for each test case $(m)$:\n1. Build $S_{m}$ as specified and $H$ as the set of all two-polarity thresholds at the $m+1$ cut positions.\n2. Compute $h^{*}$ that minimizes $L_{\\hat{S}_{m}}(h)$ over $H$ and record $L_{\\hat{S}_{m}}(h^{*})$.\n3. Compute the three bounds’ numerical upper values on the true risk using your derived expressions, with $d = 1$, $|H| = 2(m+1)$, and the specified $\\delta$.\n4. Determine which bound is tightest by selecting the smallest numerical upper bound among the three.\n\nTest suite:\n- Use the following sample sizes: $m \\in \\{10, 50, 200, 1\\}$.\n- For each $m$ in the set, perform the steps above.\n\nFinal output specification:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing a list of integers, one per test case in the same order as the test suite. Each integer indicates which bound was tightest: use $0$ for the classical Vapnik–Chervonenkis bound, $1$ for the Rademacher complexity bound, and $2$ for the Probably Approximately Correct–Bayesian bound.\n- The line must be a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[0,1,2,1]$.\n\nAll angles are abstract and there are no physical units involved. All numerical outputs must be plain decimal numbers. No percentages are to be used anywhere; any fraction must be expressed as a decimal.", "solution": "The user-provided problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem in the domain of statistical learning theory. It constitutes a request to perform a numerical comparison of three standard generalization bounds. We will now proceed with the solution, which involves deriving the mathematical expressions for each bound and then implementing a computational experiment to evaluate their numerical values.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{D}$ be an unknown underlying data distribution over $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y}$, where $\\mathcal{X} = \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{-1, +1\\}$. A hypothesis is a function $h: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{Y}$. The performance of a hypothesis $h$ is measured by the $0-1$ loss, $\\ell(h(x), y) = \\mathbf{1}_{h(x) \\neq y}$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function. The true risk (or generalization error) of $h$ is its expected loss over the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$, given by $L(h) = \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}}[\\ell(h(x), y)]$. Given a training sample $S_m = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^m$ of size $m$ drawn i.i.d. from $\\mathcal{D}$, the empirical risk is the average loss on the sample: $L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\ell(h(x_i), y_i)$.\n\nThe goal of generalization bounds is to provide a high-probability upper bound on the true risk $L(h)$ of a hypothesis in terms of its empirical risk $L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h)$, the sample size $m$, properties of the hypothesis class $H$, and a confidence parameter $\\delta \\in (0,1)$. The problem asks us to find the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) hypothesis, $h^{*} = \\arg\\min_{h \\in H} L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h)$, and then compare three different upper bounds on its true risk, $L(h^{*})$.\n\nThe hypothesis class $H$ is the set of one-dimensional threshold classifiers with two polarities. For a dataset of size $m$, the thresholds are defined by $m+1$ possible cuts. For each cut $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, there are two hypotheses, $h_k^+$ and $h_k^-$. This results in a finite hypothesis class of size $|H| = 2(m+1)$. The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of this class is $d=1$. The confidence parameter is $\\delta = 0.05$.\n\nThe derivations for the three bounds are as follows.\n\n**1. Classical Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) Bound**\n\nThe theory of Vapnik and Chervonenkis provides generalization bounds based on the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, which measures its complexity. For any hypothesis class $H$ with finite VC dimension $d$, a standard uniform convergence result states that with probability at least $1-\\delta$ over the choice of the sample $S_m$, the following holds for all $h \\in H$:\n$$\nL(h) \\le L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h) + \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{m} \\left( d \\log\\frac{2em}{d} + \\log\\frac{4}{\\delta} \\right)}\n$$\nThis bound is derived using symmetrization arguments (replacing the true risk with a second empirical risk on a \"ghost sample\") and concentration inequalities (like Hoeffding's or Bernstein's inequality) applied to the growth function $\\tau_H(m)$, which is bounded by the Sauer-Shelah lemma using the VC dimension: $\\tau_H(m) \\le (\\frac{em}{d})^d$.\n\nSince this inequality holds for all $h \\in H$, it must also hold for the ERM hypothesis $h^*$. We are given $d=1$. Substituting $h=h^*$ and $d=1$, we obtain the first bound:\n$$\nL(h^*) \\le L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h^*) + \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{m} \\left( \\log(2em) + \\log\\frac{4}{\\delta} \\right)}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the VC bound, which we will denote as Bound $0$.\n\n**2. Rademacher Complexity Bound**\n\nRademacher complexity offers a more data-dependent measure of complexity. The empirical Rademacher complexity of a function class $F$ for a sample $S_m$ is $\\hat{\\mathfrak{R}}_S(F) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\sigma} [\\sup_{f \\in F} \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sigma_i f(x_i)]$, where $\\sigma_i$ are independent Rademacher random variables (taking values $\\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$). The (expected) Rademacher complexity is $\\mathfrak{R}_m(F) = \\mathbb{E}_{S \\sim \\mathcal{D}^m}[\\hat{\\mathfrak{R}}_S(F)]$.\n\nFor binary classification with the $0-1$ loss, a standard theorem relates the true risk to the empirical risk via the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis class $H$ (where hypotheses map to $\\{-1, +1\\}$). With probability at least $1-\\delta$, for all $h \\in H$:\n$$\nL(h) \\le L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h) + 2\\mathfrak{R}_m(H) + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(1/\\delta)}{2m}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we should use an upper bound on the Rademacher complexity based on the cardinality of $H$. For a finite class $H$, Massart's lemma provides a bound on the empirical Rademacher complexity. For any fixed sample $S_m$, let $A = \\{ (h(x_1), \\dots, h(x_m)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m : h \\in H \\}$. Since $h(x_i) \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$, the Euclidean norm of any vector in $A$ is $\\|v\\|_2 = \\sqrt{m}$. Massart's lemma gives:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathfrak{R}}_S(H) \\le \\frac{\\max_{v \\in A} \\|v\\|_2 \\sqrt{2\\log|A|}}{m} = \\frac{\\sqrt{m}\\sqrt{2\\log|A|}}{m} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\log|A|}{m}}\n$$\nSince $|A| \\le |H|$, we have $\\hat{\\mathfrak{R}}_S(H) \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\log|H|}{m}}$. As this upper bound does not depend on the sample $S$, it also upper-bounds the expected Rademacher complexity: $\\mathfrak{R}_m(H) \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\log|H|}{m}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the main Rademacher inequality and applying it to $h^*$ with $|H|=2(m+1)$, we get our second bound:\n$$\nL(h^*) \\le L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h^*) + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\log(2(m+1))}{m}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(1/\\delta)}{2m}}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the Rademacher bound, denoted as Bound $1$.\n\n**3. Probably Approximately Correct–Bayesian (PAC-Bayes) Bound**\n\nThe PAC-Bayes framework provides bounds on the risk of a \"posterior\" distribution $Q$ over the hypothesis class $H$. A common form of the PAC-Bayes theorem states that for any prior distribution $P$ on $H$, with probability at least $1-\\delta$ over the sample $S_m$, the following holds for all posterior distributions $Q$ on $H$:\n$$\nL(Q) \\le L_{\\hat{S}_m}(Q) + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathrm{KL}(Q \\| P) + \\log\\frac{2m}{\\delta}}{2m}}\n$$\nHere, $L(Q) = \\mathbb{E}_{h \\sim Q}[L(h)]$ and $L_{\\hat{S}_m}(Q) = \\mathbb{E}_{h \\sim Q}[L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h)]$ are the true and empirical risks of the Gibbs classifier defined by $Q$. $\\mathrm{KL}(Q \\| P)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between $Q$ and $P$.\n\nThe problem specifies a uniform prior $P$, so $P(h) = 1/|H|$ for all $h \\in H$. The posterior $Q$ is a point mass on the ERM hypothesis $h^*$, i.e., $Q(h^*)=1$ and $Q(h)=0$ for $h \\ne h^*$. For this choice of $Q$:\n- The Gibbs classifier's risk is $L(Q) = \\sum_h Q(h)L(h) = L(h^*)$.\n- The Gibbs classifier's empirical risk is $L_{\\hat{S}_m}(Q) = \\sum_h Q(h)L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h) = L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h^*)$.\n- The KL divergence is $\\mathrm{KL}(Q \\| P) = \\sum_h Q(h) \\log\\frac{Q(h)}{P(h)} = 1 \\cdot \\log\\frac{1}{1/|H|} = \\log|H|$.\n\nSubstituting these into the PAC-Bayes inequality with $|H|=2(m+1)$, we obtain the third bound:\n$$\nL(h^*) \\le L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h^*) + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(2(m+1)) + \\log\\frac{2m}{\\delta}}{2m}}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the PAC-Bayes bound, denoted as Bound $2$.\n\nThe computational task is to calculate the numerical value of these three upper bounds for each given sample size $m$, using the empirically determined $L_{\\hat{S}_m}(h^*)$, and identify which bound yields the smallest value.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements an experiment to compare three generalization bounds (VC, Rademacher, PAC-Bayes)\n    for threshold classifiers on a deterministically generated dataset.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [10, 50, 200, 1]\n\n    results = []\n    for m in test_cases:\n        # Define constants for the current test case\n        delta = 0.05\n        d = 1  # VC dimension of 1D thresholds\n\n        # Step 1: Build the dataset S_m as specified.\n        # x_i = i/(m+1) for i in {1, ..., m} using 1-based indexing for definition.\n        if m > 0:\n            x = np.array([(i_one_based) / (m + 1) for i_one_based in range(1, m + 1)])\n            theta = 0.6\n            y = np.sign(x -
