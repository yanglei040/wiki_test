The data $\\{Y_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ are i.i.d. samples from $Y = \\mu + X$, where $X$ follows an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda  0$.\n\nFirst, we address the three parts of the problem: identifying the relevant population parameters, deriving the asymptotic excess risk, and discussing the alignment condition.\n\n1. Population Parameters for $\\ell_{1}$ and $\\ell_{2}$ Risk Minimization\n\nThe training process involves finding $\\hat{\\theta}_{n} \\in \\arg\\min_{\\theta} \\hat{R}_{\\ell_{1}}(\\theta)$, where the empirical risk is $\\hat{R}_{\\ell_{1}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|Y_{i}-\\theta|$. It is a fundamental result in statistics that the value of $\\theta$ which minimizes the sum of absolute differences to a set of points $\\{Y_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ is the sample median of those points. Therefore, $\\hat{\\theta}_{n} = \\text{median}(\\{Y_i\\}_{i=1}^n)$.\nAs the sample size $n$ tends to infinity, the sample median converges almost surely to the population median. The problem defines $\\theta_{\\ell_{1}}^{\\star}$ as this limit. Thus,\n$$ \\theta_{\\ell_{1}}^{\\star} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\hat{\\theta}_{n} = \\text{median}(Y) $$\nThe evaluation is performed using the expected $\\ell_{2}$ risk, $R_{\\ell_{2}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[(Y-\\theta)^{2}]$. To find the parameter $\\theta$ that minimizes this risk, we can differentiate $R_{\\ell_{2}}(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$ and set the derivative to zero.\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\theta}R_{\\ell_{2}}(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\mathbb{E}[(Y-\\theta)^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}(Y-\\theta)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[-2(Y-\\theta)] = -2(\\mathbb{E}[Y] - \\theta) $$\nSetting this derivative to zero yields $\\theta = \\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The second derivative is $\\frac{d^2}{d\\theta^2}R_{\\ell_{2}}(\\theta) = 2  0$, confirming that this value of $\\theta$ is indeed a minimizer. The optimal parameter under the expected squared loss is the population mean. We denote this minimizer as $\\theta_{\\ell_2}^\\star$:\n$$ \\theta_{\\ell_2}^\\star = \\arg\\inf_{\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}} R_{\\ell_2}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[Y] $$\nIn summary, the empirical $\\ell_{1}$ minimizer converges to the population median, while the expected $\\ell_{2}$ risk is minimized by the population mean.\n\n2. Derivation of the Asymptotic Excess $\\ell_{2}$ Risk\n\nThe asymptotic excess $\\ell_{2}$ risk, $\\mathcal{E}$, measures the penalty for using the $\\ell_{1}$-optimal parameter, $\\theta_{\\ell_1}^\\star$, in the context of $\\ell_2$ evaluation. It is defined as:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = R_{\\ell_{2}}(\\theta_{\\ell_{1}}^{\\star}) - \\inf_{\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}}R_{\\ell_{2}}(\\theta) = R_{\\ell_{2}}(\\theta_{\\ell_{1}}^{\\star}) - R_{\\ell_2}(\\theta_{\\ell_2}^\\star) $$\nUsing the identity $R_{\\ell_2}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[(Y-\\theta)^2] = \\text{Var}(Y) + (\\mathbb{E}[Y]-\\theta)^2$, we can express the excess risk as:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\left(\\text{Var}(Y) + (\\mathbb{E}[Y]-\\theta_{\\ell_{1}}^{\\star})^2\\right) - \\left(\\text{Var}(Y) + (\\mathbb{E}[Y]-\\theta_{\\ell_{2}}^{\\star})^2\\right) $$\nSince $\\theta_{\\ell_2}^\\star = \\mathbb{E}[Y]$, the second term simplifies, and we obtain:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = (\\mathbb{E}[Y] - \\theta_{\\ell_{1}}^{\\star})^2 = (\\mathbb{E}[Y] - \\text{median}(Y))^2 $$\nTo find a closed-form expression, we must compute the mean and median of the specified distribution $Y = \\mu + X$, where $X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$. The probability density function of $X$ is $f_X(x) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)$ for $x \\ge 0$.\n\nThe mean of $Y$ is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu + X] = \\mu + \\mathbb{E}[X] $$\nThe mean of an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$ is $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. Therefore,\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mu + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} $$\nThe median of $Y$, which we denote $m_Y$, is the value such that $P(Y \\le m_Y) = 1/2$.\n$$ P(Y \\le m_Y) = P(\\mu + X \\le m_Y) = P(X \\le m_Y - \\mu) = \\int_{0}^{m_Y - \\mu} \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x) dx = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda(m_Y - \\mu)) $$\nSetting this probability to $1/2$:\n$$ 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda(m_Y - \\mu)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\exp(-\\lambda(m_Y - \\mu)) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\lambda(m_Y - \\mu) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) \\implies m_Y - \\mu = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} $$\nThus, the median of $Y$ is:\n$$ \\text{median}(Y) = m_Y = \\mu + \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} $$\nNow we can compute the excess risk $\\mathcal{E}$ by substituting the mean and median into our expression:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\left( \\left(\\mu + \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) - \\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} - \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} \\right)^2 $$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{(1 - \\ln(2))^2}{\\lambda^2} $$\n\n3. Alignment Condition\n\nThe alignment condition is the condition under which the excess risk $\\mathcal{E}$ is zero. From our derivation, $\\mathcal{E} = (\\mathbb{E}[Y] - \\text{median}(Y))^2$. This quantity is zero if and only if:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\text{median}(Y) $$\nIn terms of population statistics, alignment occurs when the population mean is equal to the population median. In this scenario, the optimal parameter for the training loss function ($\\ell_1$) is the same as the optimal parameter for the evaluation loss function ($\\ell_2$), resulting in no performance degradation due to the mismatch.\n\nFor the given exponential-shifted model, this condition would require:\n$$ \\mu + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\mu + \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} $$\nSince $\\lambda  0$, this simplifies to $1 = \\ln(2)$. However, this is a false statement, as $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$. The exponential distribution is a skewed distribution, for which the mean and median do not coincide. Specifically, since $1  \\ln(2)$, the mean is always greater than the median for any $\\lambda  0$. Consequently, the alignment condition can never hold for this model, and the asymptotic excess risk $\\mathcal{E}$ is always strictly positive.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\left(1 - \\ln(2)\\right)^2}{\\lambda^2}}\n$$", "id": "3123205"}, {"introduction": "Real-world data is rarely a perfect reflection of the population we care about, a problem known as dataset shift.

This is the **within-split variance**, which we denote as $\\sigma^2_{\\text{within}}$.\n\nCombining these, the total variance of a single empirical risk measurement $\\hat{R}_s$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{R}_{s}) = \\sigma^2_{\\text{within}} + \\sigma^2_{\\text{between}} $$\nThis derivation explicitly shows how the total variance is a sum of the two distinct sources of variability.\n\nTo estimate $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{R})$, we need to first estimate $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{R}_{s})$. We have a sample of $k$ observations $\\{\\hat{R}_1, \\dots, \\hat{R}_k\\}$. The sample variance of these observations,\n$$ S^2_{\\hat{R}} = \\frac{1}{k-1} \\sum_{s=1}^{k} (\\hat{R}_s - \\bar{R})^2 $$\nis an unbiased estimator for the total variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{R}_{s})$. That is, $E[S^2_{\\hat{R}}] = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{R}_{s}) = \\sigma^2_{\\text{within}} + \\sigma^2_{\\text{between}}$. This single statistic empirically captures the combined effect of both sources of variance.\n\nTherefore, an unbiased estimator for the variance of the mean $\\bar{R}$ is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\bar{R}) = \\frac{S^2_{\\hat{R}}}{k} $$\nThe standard error of $\\bar{R}$ is the square root of this estimated variance:\n$$ \\mathrm{SE}(\\bar{R}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{S^2_{\\hat{R}}}{k}} = \\frac{S_{\\hat{R}}}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\nNow, we proceed with the numerical calculation. The given data for $\\hat{R}_s$ are:\n$\\{0.158, 0.171, 0.165, 0.162, 0.169, 0.155, 0.166, 0.160\\}$. We have $k=8$.\n\nFirst, compute the sample mean $\\bar{R}$:\n$$ \\bar{R} = \\frac{1}{8} (0.158 + 0.171 + 0.165 + 0.162 + 0.169 + 0.155 + 0.166 + 0.160) = \\frac{1.306}{8} = 0.16325 $$\nNext, compute the sum of squared deviations $\\sum_{s=1}^{k} (\\hat{R}_s - \\bar{R})^2$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{s=1}^{8} (\\hat{R}_s - \\bar{R})^2 =  (0.158-0.16325)^2 + (0.171-0.16325)^2 + (0.165-0.16325)^2 \\\\\n+ (0.162-0.16325)^2 + (0.169-0.16325)^2 + (0.155-0.16325)^2 \\\\\n+ (0.166-0.16325)^2 + (0.160-0.16325)^2 \\\\\n=  (-0.00525)^2 + (0.00775)^2 + (0.00175)^2 + (-0.00125)^2 \\\\\n+ (0.00575)^2 + (-0.00825)^2 + (0.00275)^2 + (-0.00325)^2 \\\\\n=  (2.75625 + 6.00625 + 0.30625 + 0.15625 + 3.30625 + 6.80625 + 0.75625 + 1.05625) \\times 10^{-5} \\\\\n=  2.115 \\times 10^{-4}\n\\end{align*}\nNow, compute the sample variance $S^2_{\\hat{R}}$:\n$$ S^2_{\\hat{R}} = \\frac{1}{k-1} \\sum_{s=1}^{k} (\\hat{R}_s - \\bar{R})^2 = \\frac{2.115 \\times 10^{-4}}{8-1} = \\frac{2.115 \\times 10^{-4}}{7} \\approx 3.0214286 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThe estimated variance of the mean is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\bar{R}) = \\frac{S^2_{\\hat{R}}}{k} = \\frac{3.0214286 \\times 10^{-5}}{8} \\approx 3.7767857 \\times 10^{-6} $$\nThe standard error of the mean is:\n$$ \\mathrm{SE}(\\bar{R}) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\bar{R})} = \\sqrt{3.7767857 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 0.001943395 $$\nThe problem asks for the half-width of a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $R$, using a Student's $t$ approximation with $\\nu = k-1 = 7$ degrees of freedom. The half-width $H$ is given by:\n$$ H = t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\times \\mathrm{SE}(\\bar{R}) $$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha=0.05$, so $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The critical value from the $t$-distribution with $\\nu=7$ degrees of freedom is:\n$$ t_{0.025, 7} \\approx 2.3646 $$\nNow, we compute the half-width:\n$$ H = 2.3646 \\times 0.001943395 \\approx 0.00459523 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$ H \\approx 0.004595 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.004595}$$", "id": "3123300"}]}
