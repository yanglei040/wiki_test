By explicitly constructing this interpolating function, you will analyze its geometric properties, such as its Lipschitz constant and functional margin, and connect these concepts to the model's generalization performance.", "problem": "You are to implement and analyze a minimal yet mathematically consistent classification setting using a two-layer feedforward network (Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity to explore zero training error in the overparameterized regime and relate the resulting margin to test performance. Treat inputs as one-dimensional real numbers, and consider binary labels in $\\{-1, +1\\}$. The overall goal is to construct, from first principles, an explicit overparameterized two-layer ReLU MLP that exactly interpolates the training data, compute a principled margin for this model, and evaluate its test accuracy against a specified ground-truth classifier.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- A feedforward two-layer network implements functions that are finite sums of shifted and scaled Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activations plus an output bias; namely, an output of the form $f(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_j \\max(0, w_j x + b_j) + c$, where $m$ is the width (number of hidden units).\n- The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is defined by $\\mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z)$.\n- The classifier induced by $f$ predicts $\\widehat{y}(x) = \\mathrm{sign}(f(x)) \\in \\{-1,+1\\}$, where $\\mathrm{sign}(t) = -1$ if $t  0$ and $+1$ otherwise.\n- The empirical $0$–$1$ classification loss on a dataset $\\{(x_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ is the average of the indicator $\\mathbb{1}\\{\\widehat{y}(x_i) \\neq y_i\\}$ over the $n$ points, but in this task you must ensure $\\widehat{y}(x_i) = y_i$ for all $i$, i.e., zero training error.\n- For one-dimensional piecewise linear $f$, define the (global) Lipschitz constant on a closed interval $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ by $L = \\sup_{x \\in [x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]} |f'(x)|$, where $f'$ exists almost everywhere and is piecewise constant. This $L$ equals the maximum absolute slope of $f$ across the linear pieces induced by the hidden units.\n- Define the functional margin on the training set as $\\gamma = \\min_{i} \\frac{y_i f(x_i)}{L}$, with the convention that if $L = 0$ then $\\gamma = +\\infty$.\n\nYour construction task:\n- For each provided training set, construct an explicit two-layer ReLU MLP with width at least $n$ that interpolates the given training samples $(x_i, y_i)$ exactly, achieving zero training error. You must not use iterative training; instead, derive the weights directly from the requirement $f(x_i) = y_i$ and the piecewise linear structure of ReLU networks. Your construction should be principled, relying only on foundational properties of ReLU sums forming piecewise linear functions, and must be valid for strictly increasing inputs $x_1  x_2  \\cdots  x_n$.\n- Compute the Lipschitz constant $L$ as the maximum absolute slope across the linear segments between consecutive $x_i$.\n- Compute the margin $\\gamma$ using the formula above.\n\nGround-truth for test performance:\n- Use the fixed ground-truth classifier $h^\\star(x) = \\mathrm{sign}(x)$ to define the true label at any real $x$, with the convention $\\mathrm{sign}(0) = +1$.\n\nTest accuracy specification:\n- For each test case, evaluate the classifier induced by your constructed $f$ on a uniform grid of $M$ test points over the closed interval $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ spanned by the training inputs of that case, where $x_{\\min} = \\min_i x_i$ and $x_{\\max} = \\max_i x_i$. Compute the test accuracy as the fraction (in decimal form) of test points where $\\mathrm{sign}(f(x))$ matches $h^\\star(x)$.\n\nTest suite:\n- There are four test cases. Each case consists of a triplet $(\\text{inputs}, \\text{labels}, M)$, where:\n    1. Case A (well-separated classes, happy path): inputs $[-2.0, -1.0, 1.0, 2.0]$, labels $[-1, -1, +1, +1]$, $M = 401$.\n    2. Case B (highly localized alternation, boundary stress): inputs $[-0.1, 0.0, 0.1]$, labels $[-1, +1, -1]$, $M = 401$.\n    3. Case C (alternating labels over moderate distances, oscillatory): inputs $[-1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0]$, labels $[-1, +1, -1, +1, -1]$, $M = 801$.\n    4.

All numerical answers must be plain decimals.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is mathematically well-defined, self-contained, and grounded in the established principles of neural networks and statistical learning theory. The task requires the direct construction of a function and the computation of its properties, which is a feasible and objective procedure.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four main steps for each test case:\n1.  **Constructing the Interpolating MLP**: We construct a two-layer ReLU network that exactly interpolates the training data $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$.\n2.  **Computing the Lipschitz Constant ($L$)**: We determine the maximum absolute slope of the constructed function.\n3.  **Computing the Margin ($\\gamma$)**: We apply the provided formula for the functional margin.\n4.  **Evaluating Test Accuracy**: We compare the predictions of our classifier against the ground-truth classifier on a specified test grid.\n\n### 1. Construction of the Interpolating MLP\nThe problem asks for a two-layer feedforward network of the form $f(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_j \\max(0, w_j x + b_j) + c$ that interpolates the training data, i.e., $f(x_i) = y_i$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$. We are given that the inputs are sorted: $x_1  x_2  \\dots  x_n$.\n\nA function composed of a sum of ReLU units is continuous and piecewise linear. The \"kinks\" or non-differentiable points of such a function occur where the arguments of the ReLU functions are zero. We can construct a piecewise linear function that passes through all points $(x_i, y_i)$ by placing kinks at each $x_i$. This leads to a specific choice of network parameters.\n\nLet's define our network with width $m=n$, where $n$ is the number of data points. This satisfies the overparameterization constraint $m \\ge n$. For each hidden unit $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, we set its weights and bias to create a kink at $x_j$. A simple choice is $w_j = 1$ and $b_j = -x_j$, so the activation is $\\max(0, x - x_j)$.\n\nThe full function can be expressed as:\n$$f(x) = c + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j \\max(0, x - x_j)$$\nThis function is a valid two-layer ReLU network. The first layer computes $z_j = x - x_j$, and the second layer combines the ReLU activations of these $z_j$.\n\nTo ensure $f(x_i)=y_i$, we must determine the coefficients $c$ and $a_j$. The function's derivative $f'(x)$ is a step function. The slope in any interval $(x_k, x_{k+1})$ is given by $\\sum_{j=1}^k a_j$. To make $f(x)$ the linear interpolant of the points, its slope in the interval $(x_k, x_{k+1})$ must be:\n$$s_k = \\frac{y_{k+1} - y_k}{x_{k+1} - x_k} \\quad \\text{for } k=1, \\dots, n-1$$\nWe also enforce that the function is flat outside the data range, setting the slope to $0$ for $x  x_1$ and $x  x_n$. Let $s_0 = 0$ and $s_n = 0$.\n\nThe coefficient $a_j$ represents the change in slope at $x_j$. Therefore:\n- At $x_1$, the slope changes from $s_0=0$ to $s_1$. So, $a_1 = s_1 - s_0 = s_1$.\n- At $x_k$ for $k=2, \\dots, n-1$, the slope changes from $s_{k-1}$ to $s_k$. So, $a_k = s_k - s_{k-1}$.\n- At $x_n$, the slope changes from $s_{n-1}$ to $s_n=0$. So, $a_n = s_n - s_{n-1} = -s_{n-1}$.\n\nFinally, the output bias $c$ is determined by the condition $f(x_1) = y_1$. At $x=x_1$, all $\\max(0, x_1-x_j)$ terms are zero for $j \\geq 1$. Thus, $f(x_1) = c$, which implies $c = y_1$.\n\nThe final constructed function is:\n$$f(x) = y_1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j \\max(0, x - x_j)$$\nThis construction guarantees $f(x_i) = y_i$ for all $i$, achieving zero training error.\n\n### 2. Computing the Lipschitz Constant ($L$)\nThe Lipschitz constant $L$ on the interval $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}] = [x_1, x_n]$ is the maximum absolute value of the function's derivative, $L = \\sup_{x \\in [x_1, x_n]} |f'(x)|$.\nSince our function $f(x)$ is piecewise linear with slopes $s_k$ on the segments $(x_k, x_{k+1})$, the Lipschitz constant is simply the maximum absolute slope:\n$$L = \\max_{k=1, \\dots, n-1} |s_k| = \\max_{k=1, \\dots, n-1} \\left| \\frac{y_{k+1} - y_k}{x_{k+1} - x_k} \\right|$$\nIf $n \\le 1$ or all slopes are zero, then $L=0$.\n\n### 3. Computing the Margin ($\\gamma$)\nThe functional margin is defined as $\\gamma = \\min_{i} \\frac{y_i f(x_i)}{L}$. By our construction, $f(x_i) = y_i$. The labels are $y_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$. Therefore, for each training point $i$:\n$$y_i f(x_i) = y_i^2 = 1$$\nThe expression for the margin simplifies to:\n$$\\gamma = \\min_{i} \\frac{1}{L} = \\frac{1}{L}$$\nAs per the problem definition, if $L=0$, the margin is $\\gamma = +\\infty$.\n\n### 4. Evaluating Test Accuracy\nThe test accuracy is computed on a uniform grid of $M$ points spanning the training data interval $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$. For each test point $x_{test}$:\n- The ground-truth label is $y_{true} = h^\\star(x_{test}) = \\mathrm{sign}(x_{test})$, where $\\mathrm{sign}(0)=+1$.\n- The model's prediction is $\\hat{y}_{pred} = \\mathrm{sign}(f(x_{test}))$, where $\\mathrm{sign}(t)=+1$ for $t \\ge 0$ and $-1$ for $t0$.\nThe accuracy is the fraction of test points where $y_{true} = \\hat{y}_{pred}$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the four test cases provided. For instance, in Case A, the slopes are $s_1=0$, $s_2=1$, and $s_3=0$, yielding $L=1$ and $\\gamma=1/1=1$. The constructed function $f(x) = -1 + \\max(0, x+1) - \\max(0, x-1)$ aligns perfectly with the ground truth $h^\\star(x)$ over its domain, resulting in a test accuracy of $1.0$. The other cases are solved analogously.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases.\n    It defines the test cases, processes each one, and prints the formatted results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (well-separated classes, happy path)\n        ({'inputs': [-2.0, -1.0, 1.0, 2.0], 'labels': [-1, -1, 1, 1], 'M': 401}),\n        # Case B (highly localized alternation, boundary stress)\n        ({'inputs': [-0.1, 0.0, 0.1], 'labels': [-1, 1, -1], 'M': 401}),\n        # Case C (alternating labels over moderate distances, oscillatory)\n        ({'inputs': [-1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0], 'labels': [-1, 1, -1, 1, -1], 'M': 801}),\n        # Case D (uniform negative labels, extreme smoothness edge case)\n        ({'inputs': [-2.0, -0.5, 0.5, 2.0], 'labels': [-1, -1, -1, -1], 'M': 801})\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        result = analyze_case(case['inputs'], case['labels'], case['M'])\n        all_results.append(result)\n\n    # Format and print the final output as a comma-separated list of lists.\n    # e.g., [[gamma1,acc1],[gamma2,acc2],...]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'[{g},{a}]' for g, a in all_results)}]\")\n\ndef analyze_case(inputs, labels, M):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs an MLP, computes its margin and test accuracy for a single case.\n\n    Args:\n        inputs (list): Sorted list of 1D input features.\n        labels (list): List of binary labels {-1, 1}.\n        M (int): Number of points in the test grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A pair [gamma, accuracy].\n    \"\"\"\n    x = np.array(inputs, dtype=np.float64)\n    y = np.array(labels, dtype=np.float64)\n    n = len(x)\n\n    # 1.

It is critical to ensure that the angles are treated as being in radians, which is the default for standard numerical libraries like NumPy.\n\nThe three activation functions, ReLU, SiLU, and GELU, are implemented according to their mathematical definitions. ReLU is a simple maximum operation. SiLU involves the logistic sigmoid function $\\sigma(z) = (1+e^{-z})^{-1}$. GELU is given as a specific smooth approximation involving the hyperbolic tangent function.\n\nA generic MLP model function is constructed. It takes a set of input vectors $x$ and an activation function $\\phi$ and computes the corresponding outputs. This is designed to handle batches of inputs efficiently, for instance, all points on the 1D slice or the 2D grid simultaneously. For an input matrix $X$ of shape $(\\text{num\\_points}, 2)$, the computation proceeds as:\n1.  Compute pre-activations: $Z = X W_{1}^T + b_{1}$. Broadcasting handles the addition of the bias vector $b_1$.\n2.  Apply activation: $A = \\phi(Z)$. This is an element-wise operation.\n3.  Compute final output: $Y = A W_{2}^T + b_{2}$.\n\n**2. Metric R: Empirical Linear Region Count**\nThe problem defines this metric on a 1D slice $x(t)=(t,t)$ of the input space.\n1.  A set of $N=1025$ equidistant points $t_{\\ell}$ is generated in the interval $[-2,2]$. These form the input vectors $x(t_{\\ell})$.\n2.  The MLP model $f$ is evaluated at these points to get the outputs $y_{\\ell}$.\n3.  The first differences $s_{\\ell} = y_{\\ell+1} - y_{\\ell}$ and second differences $d_{\\ell} = s_{\\ell+1} - s_{\\ell}$ are computed. The second difference is a discrete approximation of the second derivative. For a piecewise linear function like that produced by a ReLU network, the second derivative is zero everywhere except at the \"kinks,\" where it is undefined (a Dirac delta). The numerical second difference will exhibit a spike at these points.\n4.  The number of kinks $R$ is counted by summing up the instances where the absolute value of the second difference $|d_{\\ell}|$ exceeds a threshold $\\tau = 10^{-2}$. For the smooth functions (SiLU, GELU), the second derivative is well-defined and continuous, so the second differences are expected to be small and not cross the threshold, leading to $R=0$. For ReLU, a positive count is expected.\n\n**3. Metric S: Empirical Smoothness**\nThis metric quantifies the smoothness of the function over a 2D grid.\n1.  A uniform grid of $G \\times G$ points (with $G=81$) is created over the square domain $[-2,2] \\times [-2,2]$. The MLP $f$ is evaluated at every point on this grid, yielding a scalar field $F[u,v]$.\n2.  The gradient of $f$ is approximated at each interior grid point using the central difference formula. This provides a vector field $g[u,v] \\approx \\nabla f$.\n3.  The smoothness measure $S$ is calculated as the average variation of this gradient field between adjacent points. This involves computing the Euclidean norm of the difference between gradient vectors at neighboring grid points, both horizontally and vertically.\n4.  The sum of these norm differences is normalized by the total number of pairs considered, $E = 2(G-2)(G-3)$. A smaller value of $S$ indicates that the gradient changes more slowly, implying a smoother function. We expect ReLU, being only $C^0$ continuous, to have a larger $S$ than the infinitely differentiable SiLU and GELU functions.\nThe implementation will systematically perform these computations for each of the three activation functions and format the results as specified.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes empirical linearity and smoothness metrics for an MLP \n    with different activation functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ---- 1.

However, modern deep learning models, which are often massively overparameterized, defy this classical picture. This practice guides you through an empirical demonstration of the 'double descent' phenomenon, where test error, after peaking near the point of data interpolation, begins to decrease again as model capacity grows even further [@problem_id:3151120]. You will investigate this counter-intuitive behavior in a controlled setting, linking the parameter-to-sample ratio to test performance.", "problem": "You are tasked with empirically demonstrating the double descent phenomenon in a feedforward Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) by sweeping the parameter–sample ratio and linking the interpolation threshold to a spike in test error. The core setting is as follows.\n\nStart from the foundational base of empirical risk minimization under squared loss. Let the input space be $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Consider a two-layer feedforward Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity, where the hidden layer weights are fixed and only the output layer weights are trained. For an input vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, the MLP computes\n$$\n\\phi(x) = \\big(\\sigma(w_1^\\top x + b_1), \\ldots, \\sigma(w_m^\\top x + b_m)\\big) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m,\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma(z) = \\max\\{0, z\\}$ is the ReLU activation, $w_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $b_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are fixed hidden-layer parameters, and $m$ is the number of hidden units. The predicted output is\n$$\n\\hat{y}(x) = a^\\top \\phi(x),\n$$\nwhere $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ are the trained output-layer weights. Given training data $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, define the design matrix\n$$\n\\Phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}, \\quad \\Phi_{ij} = \\sigma(w_j^\\top x_i + b_j).\n$$\nThe empirical risk minimization problem under squared loss seeks $a$ minimizing $\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y}(x_i) - y_i)^2$, which is a linear least squares problem. The minimum-norm solution is given by the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse:\n$$\na^\\star = \\Phi^+ y,\n$$\nwhere $y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)^\\top$ and $\\Phi^+$ denotes the pseudoinverse of $\\Phi$. The interpolation threshold is reached when the training mean squared error becomes zero, which typically occurs once $\\Phi$ reaches full row rank as $m$ grows, so that the system $\\Phi a = y$ admits a solution. The parameter–sample ratio is defined as $p/n$, where $p$ is the number of trained parameters. In this setting, $p = m$.\n\nThe double descent phenomenon refers to the typical behavior where the test error as a function of model capacity initially decreases, then increases near the interpolation threshold (where training error hits zero), and then decreases again beyond that threshold as capacity further increases. Your program will construct synthetic data from a teacher network and measure test mean squared error across a sweep of $m$ values corresponding to different parameter–sample ratios.\n\nData generation and evaluation protocol:\n- Draw inputs $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ independently from a standard normal distribution.\n- Generate labels using a fixed teacher network with a small number of ReLU units:\n$$\ny = \\sum_{k=1}^{m_{\\text{teacher}}} \\beta_k \\, \\sigma(u_k^\\top x + c_k) + \\varepsilon,\n$$\nwhere $u_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, $c_k \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $\\beta_k \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are fixed teacher parameters, and $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ is independent Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\\sigma$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of instructions for an empirical study of the double descent phenomenon in a random feature model. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe objective is to empirically investigate the double descent phenomenon in a simplified multilayer perceptron (MLP). This phenomenon describes a U-shaped then downward-sloping curve for test error as a function of model capacity. The initial decrease corresponds to the classical bias-variance trade-off in the underparameterized regime. The test error then peaks near the interpolation threshold, where the model has just enough capacity to fit the training data perfectly. Beyond this point, in the overparameterized regime, the test error surprisingly decreases again.\n\nThe methodology is structured as a controlled numerical experiment based on a teacher-student framework.\n\n**1. Model Specification and Training**\n\nThe model is a two-layer feedforward network with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, $\\sigma(z) = \\max\\{0, z\\}$. For an input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, the output is $\\hat{y}(x) = a^\\top \\phi(x)$, where $\\phi(x) = (\\sigma(w_1^\\top x + b_1), \\ldots, \\sigma(w_m^\\top x + b_m))$ is a vector of feature activations. A crucial aspect of this problem is that the hidden layer parameters, $\\{w_j, b_j\\}_{j=1}^m$, are fixed after random initialization. Only the output layer weights, $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, are trained. This transforms the nonlinear neural network problem into a linear regression problem in a high-dimensional feature space, known as a random feature model. The number of hidden units, $m$, directly corresponds to the number of trainable parameters and serves as our measure of model capacity.\n\nGiven $n$ training samples $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, we form the design matrix $\\Phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$, where each element is $\\Phi_{ij} = \\sigma(w_j^\\top x_i + b_j)$. The goal is to find the weight vector $a$ that minimizes the squared loss, $\\mathcal{L}(a) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - a^\\top \\phi(x_i))^2 = \\|y - \\Phi a\\|_2^2$.\n\nThe solution to this linear least-squares problem that also has the minimum Euclidean norm $\\|a\\|_2$ is given by $a^\\star = \\Phi^+ y$. Here, $\\Phi^+$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the design matrix $\\Phi$, and $y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)^\\top$ is the vector of training labels. The pseudoinverse provides a unique, stable solution for any shape of $\\Phi$, correctly handling both the underparameterized ($m  n$, typically full column rank) and overparameterized ($m  n$, typically full row rank) regimes.\n\n**2. Data Generation and Evaluation**\n\nWe employ a teacher-student setup to create a synthetic dataset with a known ground truth.\n- A fixed \"teacher\" network of the same architecture, with $m_{\\text{teacher}} = 5$ hidden units, generates the labels: $y = \\sum_{k=1}^{m_{\\text{teacher}}} \\beta_k \\, \\sigma(u_k^\\top x + c_k) + \\varepsilon$. The input vectors $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are drawn from a standard normal distribution. Gaussian noise $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ is added to the output, modeling inherent measurement error or unmodeled effects.\n- A \"student\" model (our trainable model) is then trained on a set of $n$ such data points.\n- The performance of the trained student model is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on both the training set and an independent, larger test set of size $n_{\\text{test}} = \\max\\{3n, 200\\}$.\n  - $\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{train}}(m) = \\frac{1}{n} \\|\\Phi a^\\star - y\\|^2$\n  - $\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{test}}(m) = \\frac{1}{n_{\\text{test}}} \\| \\Phi_{\\text{test}} a^\\star - y_{\\text{test}}\\|^2$\n\n**3. Experimental Procedure and Spike Detection**\n\nThe core of the experiment is to track $\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{test}}(m)$ as we sweep the model capacity $m$. The problem defines a specific sweep protocol: the set of capacities $\\mathcal{M}$ is generated by scaling the number of samples $n$ by ratios $\\{0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5\\}$. This set of ratios is designed to probe model behavior in the underparameterized regime ($m/n  1$), at the interpolation threshold ($m/n \\approx 1$), and in the overparameterized regime ($m/n  1$). To ensure results are comparable across the sweep, the random features for the largest model ($m_{\\max} = \\max \\mathcal{M}$) are generated once, and smaller models simply use a subset of these features.\n\nThe double descent hypothesis predicts a spike in $\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{test}}$ around the point where the model first perfectly fits the training data. This point is formalized as the interpolation threshold, $m_{\\text{interp}}$, defined as the smallest $m \\in \\mathcal{M}$ for which $\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{train}}(m) \\le \\epsilon$, with a small tolerance $\\epsilon = 10^{-10}$.\n\nA \"spike\" is said to be detected if the test error at this threshold is significantly higher than the typical test error at other capacities. The condition is given by the inequality:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{test}}(m_{\\text{interp}})  (1 + \\delta) \\cdot \\operatorname{median}\\left(\\{\\mathrm{MSE}_{\\text{test}}(m) : m \\in \\mathcal{M}, m \\ne m_{\\text{interp}}\\}\\right)\n$$\nwhere the spike margin is $\\delta = 0.1$. If this condition is met, the result for the test case is $\\mathrm{True}$; otherwise, it is $\\mathrm{False}$. If no $m$ in the sweep achieves interpolation, the result is also $\\mathrm{False}$.\n\nThe implementation will execute this entire procedure for each of the four specified test cases, using the given random seeds for reproducibility, and report the boolean outcome of the spike detection test.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_single_case(n, d, sigma, seed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a single simulation case for the double descent experiment.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): Number of training samples.\n        d (int): Input dimension.\n        sigma (float): Standard deviation of label noise.\n        seed (int): Random seed for reproducibility.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if a spike is detected, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    np.random.seed(seed)\n\n    # 1.
