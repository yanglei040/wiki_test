This first practice places you in the role of a machine designer, tasked with making a concrete design choice to achieve a desired performance target. You will determine the necessary compression factor for a Turing Machine, bridging the gap between the theorem's abstract promise and a specific engineering parameter [@problem_id:1430465].", "problem": "A computer scientist is working with a language $L$ which is decided by a specific single-tape Turing Machine (TM), denoted as $M$. The worst-case time complexity of $M$ is known to be $T(n) = 2n^2 + 10n$, where $n$ is the length of the input string. According to the linear speedup theorem, it is possible to construct a new single-tape TM, let's call it $M'$, that also decides $L$ but runs significantly faster. The goal is to design $M'$ to have a time complexity of $T'(n) \\le n^2 + n + c$ for all sufficiently large $n$, where $c$ is a constant.\n\nThe construction of $M'$ involves tape compression, where each cell on $M'$'s tape represents a block of $k$ consecutive symbols from $M$'s tape. The simulation phase of $M'$ consists of macro-steps, where each macro-step of $M'$ simulates multiple steps of $M$ in a constant number of $M'$'s own steps. A thorough analysis shows that simulating what occurs across a local region of $M$'s tape (the current block and its two neighbors) to determine the outcome of $k$ steps of $M$ can be done in 8 steps by $M'$ (read, compute, write, and move to the next relevant block).\n\nWhich of the following choices correctly describes a necessary part of the design for $M'$, including the minimum integer compression factor $k$ that guarantees the target time complexity is met?\n\nA. Use a compression factor $k=8$. The state of $M'$ encodes the state of $M$ and the position of $M$'s head within the current $k$-symbol block. This is sufficient as $k1$, ensuring a speedup.\n\nB. Use a compression factor $k=16$. The state of $M'$ must encode the state of $M$, the head position within the current block, and the contents of the left and right adjacent blocks on its tape to allow for local simulation.\n\nC. Use a compression factor $k=17$. The state of $M'$ must encode the state of $M$, the head position within the current block, and the contents of the left and right adjacent blocks on its tape to allow for local simulation.\n\nD. Use a compression factor $k=17$. The state of $M'$ only needs to encode the state of $M$. To handle boundary crossings between blocks, $M'$ moves its head to the adjacent cell to read it, which takes one extra step per crossing.\n\nE. The speedup to $n^2 + n + c$ is impossible to guarantee for a single-tape TM. This level of speedup would require a multi-tape TM, which is a different machine model.", "solution": "We are given a single-tape TM $M$ with worst-case time $T(n)=2n^{2}+10n$. We construct a compressed single-tape simulator $M'$ using block compression by a factor $k$, where each cell on $M'$ encodes $k$ consecutive symbols of $M$. The macro-step simulation assumption states that $M'$ can simulate $k$ steps of $M$ in $8$ steps of $M'$, by reading the current block and its two neighbors, performing the local computation, writing the updated blocks, and moving to the next relevant block.\n\nLet $T'(n)$ denote the time of $M'$ on inputs of length $n$. The standard linear speedup analysis for single-tape TMs with block compression yields\n$$\nT'(n) \\le \\frac{8}{k}\\,T(n) + \\alpha n + \\beta,\n$$\nwhere the term $\\alpha n$ accounts for linear-time overheads such as initial packing of the input into blocks, and $\\beta$ is a constant.

Equivalently, for some constant $c$ and all sufficiently large $n$,\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{16}{k}\\right)n^{2} + \\left(1 - \\frac{80}{k} - \\alpha\\right)n + (c - \\beta) \\ge 0.\n$$\nFor this inequality to hold for all sufficiently large $n$, the leading coefficient must be strictly positive:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{16}{k} > 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad k > 16.\n$$\nIf $k=16$, then the quadratic term cancels and we would require $1 - \\frac{80}{16} - \\alpha \\ge 0$, i.e., $1 - 5 - \\alpha \\ge 0$, which is impossible since $\\alpha \\ge 0$. Therefore the minimum integer $k$ that guarantees the target asymptotic bound is $k=17$.\n\nNext, we identify the necessary finite-control information in $M'$. To perform each macro-step in constant time (here, $8$ steps) without incurring extra head motion, $M'$ must locally determine the effect of $k$ steps of $M$ across possible head movements within the current $k$-symbol block and across the boundaries into neighboring blocks. This requires that the finite control of $M'$ encode:\n- the current state of $M$,\n- the position of $M$’s head within the current $k$-symbol block (an integer in $\\{0,\\dots,k-1\\}$),\n- the contents of the current, left-adjacent, and right-adjacent blocks (so that $M'$ can compute the $k$-step outcome locally without extra scans).\n\nSince $k$ is a fixed constant, encoding these block contents in the control (via an enlarged but finite state space) is feasible. Without storing the adjacent blocks, $M'$ would need to move to read them during the macro-step, causing more than a constant overhead per macro-step and violating the assumed $8$-step simulation.\n\nTherefore, the correct design choice is to use $k=17$ and to encode in the control the state of $M$, the head position within the current block, and the contents of the adjacent blocks for constant-time local simulation.

To achieve this, the finite control of $M_k$ must store not only the current state of $M_{k-1}$ but also the local tape configuration of $M_{k-1}$. The construction protocol specifies that a state in $Q_k$ must encode the current state from $Q_{k-1}$ and the contents of a tape segment of $M_{k-1}$ of length $3m$ symbols (the $m$ symbols corresponding to the current position of $M_k$'s head, plus the $m$ symbols in the block to the immediate left and the $m$ symbols in the block to the immediate right).\n\nAfter $N$ complete iterations of this procedure, we have the final machine $M_N$ with state set $Q_N$ and alphabet $\\Gamma_N$.\n\nDetermine the value of the ratio $\\frac{\\ln(|Q_N|)}{\\ln(|\\Gamma_N|)}$, where $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm.
