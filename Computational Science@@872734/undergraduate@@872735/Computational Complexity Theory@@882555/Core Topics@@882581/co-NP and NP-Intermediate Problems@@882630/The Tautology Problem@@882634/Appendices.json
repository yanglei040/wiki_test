This exercise demonstrates a more powerful approach: recognizing fundamental logical structures that guarantee a formula's truth value. By identifying a contradiction in the antecedent of an implication, you can determine the entire formula is a tautology without ever needing to evaluate its complex consequent, a principle known as the principle of explosion. [@problem_id:1464038]", "problem": "In the field of formal verification, a program's logic is often converted into a propositional formula to check for properties like correctness and safety. Consider a specific logical formula, denoted by $\\Psi$, which is being analyzed. The formula is structured as follows:\n\n$$ \\Psi = ( (p \\rightarrow q) \\land \\neg(p \\rightarrow q) ) \\rightarrow R $$\n\nHere, $p$ and $q$ are simple propositional variables. The subformula $R$, however, is an extremely large and complex logical expression involving thousands of distinct variables. The computational cost of evaluating the truth value of $R$ for any given assignment of its variables is prohibitively high.\n\nYou are tasked with determining the logical nature of the entire formula $\\Psi$ without performing any evaluation of the subformula $R$.\n\nFor this problem, the standard logical connectives are defined as:\n- **Negation** ($\\neg$): $\\neg A$ is true if and only if $A$ is false.\n- **Conjunction** ($\\land$): $A \\land B$ is true if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are true.\n- **Implication** ($\\rightarrow$): $A \\rightarrow B$ is false if and only if $A$ is true and $B$ is false.

Let's denote the subformula $(p \\rightarrow q)$ as $A$. The antecedent can then be written as $A \\land \\neg A$.\n\nAccording to the principle of non-contradiction in classical logic, a proposition and its negation cannot both be true simultaneously. Let's verify this for $A \\land \\neg A$ using the definition of conjunction ($\\land$).\n- If $A$ is true, then $\\neg A$ is false. In this case, $A \\land \\neg A$ becomes (True $\\land$ False), which is False.\n- If $A$ is false, then $\\neg A$ is true. In this case, $A \\land \\neg A$ becomes (False $\\land$ True), which is False.\n\nIn both possible cases, the expression $A \\land \\neg A$ is always false. This means the antecedent of our formula $\\Psi$, which is $(p \\rightarrow q) \\land \\neg(p \\rightarrow q)$, is a contradiction. It is always false, regardless of the truth values of $p$ and $q$.\n\nNow, let's consider the entire formula $\\Psi$, which is an implication of the form (antecedent) $\\rightarrow R$. We have just established that the antecedent is always false.\n\nWe now use the definition of the implication connective ($\\rightarrow$). An implication $X \\rightarrow Y$ is only false in one specific scenario: when the antecedent $X$ is true and the consequent $Y$ is false. In all other cases, the implication is true.\nThe cases are:\n1.  True $\\rightarrow$ True = True\n2.  True $\\rightarrow$ False = False\n3.  False $\\rightarrow$ True = True\n4.  False $\\rightarrow$ False = True\n\nIn our formula $\\Psi$, the antecedent $( (p \\rightarrow q) \\land \\neg(p \\rightarrow q) )$ is always false. This corresponds to cases 3 and 4 in the list above. The truth value of the consequent, $R$, does not matter. If $R$ is true, the implication is (False $\\rightarrow$ True), which evaluates to True. If $R$ is false, the implication is (False $\\rightarrow$ False), which also evaluates to True.\n\nTherefore, the entire formula $\\Psi$ is always true, irrespective of the truth values of $p$, $q$, or any of the variables within the complex subformula $R$.\n\nA formula that is true for every possible truth assignment of its variables is, by definition, a tautology.\n\nSo, we can conclude that $\\Psi$ is a tautology without needing to evaluate $R$. This corresponds to option A.\n- Option B is incorrect because $\\Psi$ is always true, not false.\n- Option C is incorrect because the truth value of $\\Psi$ is always true, which is not necessarily the same as the truth value of $R$.\n- Option D is incorrect because we were able to determine the nature of $\\Psi$ without evaluating $R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1464038"}, {"introduction": "Connecting logic to computer science, this problem asks you to analyze the computational cost of verifying a tautology.

It then makes two recursive calls: one with `p` assigned to `True` and another with `p` assigned to `False`. The function returns `True` if and only if both of these recursive calls return `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nTo check if a formula `F` is a tautology, an initial call is made to `CheckTautology(F, A_0)`, where `A_0` is the empty set of assignments.\n\nConsider the following propositional formula $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi = (p \\to (q \\to r)) \\to ((p \\to q) \\to (p \\to r)) $$\n\nWhat is the total number of calls made to the `CheckTautology` function to determine whether $\\phi$ is a tautology, including the initial call?", "solution": "Let $V(\\phi)$ denote the set of variables in the formula.

Since $\\phi$ is indeed a tautology, no branch returns $\\text{False}$, so no early termination can occur and the entire binary recursion tree is explored.\n\nLet $T(n)$ be the total number of calls (including the initial call) made by CheckTautology on a formula with $n$ distinct variables when the formula is a tautology. Then:\n- Base case: when $n=0$, there is exactly one call that immediately evaluates and returns, so\n$$\nT(0)=1.\n$$\n- Recursive step: for $n \\geq 1$, the top-level call makes two recursive calls on formulas with $n-1$ remaining unassigned variables, and we count the current call itself, hence\n$$\nT(n)=1+2\\,T(n-1).\n$$\nSolve the recurrence by defining $S(n)=T(n)+1$.
