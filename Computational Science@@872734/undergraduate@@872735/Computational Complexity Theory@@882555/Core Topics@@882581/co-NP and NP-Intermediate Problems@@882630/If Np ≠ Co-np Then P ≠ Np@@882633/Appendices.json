Let P be the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine.

This means that if a language $L$ is in P, then its complement $\\bar{L}$ (the set of all strings not in $L$) is also in P. In contrast, it is a known fact from computability theory that RE is not closed under complement, which implies RE $\\neq$ co-RE, where co-RE is the class of languages whose complements are in RE.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical discussion between two students who are trying to understand the relationships between these classes.\n\nAlice claims: \"The assumption $P = \\text{RE}$ is nonsensical from the start, because we know P is a strict subset of RE.

If RE were equal to P, it would necessarily inherit all of P's properties, including closure under complement. This would directly imply that RE = co-RE.\n\nB. Bob is incorrect. The property of not being closed under complement is an intrinsic characteristic of the RE class, stemming from its definition based on one-way halting. The hypothetical equality $P = \\text{RE}$ cannot change this fundamental property of the machine model defining RE.\n\nC. Bob is correct, but for a trivial reason not related to complexity theory. His claim is an implication of the form \"if A then B\", where the premise A ($P = \\text{RE}$) is known to be false. In formal logic, any such implication with a false premise is considered 'vacuously true', irrespective of what the conclusion B is.\n\nD. Bob is incorrect. If $P = \\text{RE}$, then for any language $L$ in co-RE, its complement $\\bar{L}$ is in RE, and thus in P. Since P is closed under complement, $L$ itself must be in P, and therefore in RE. This only proves that co-RE is a subset of RE, not that they are equal.\n\nE. Bob's claim cannot be evaluated.
