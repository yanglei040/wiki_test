The corresponding Resonance Values are 17, 8, and 42.\nLet's calculate the sum:\nSum = $17 + 8 + 42 = 25 + 42 = 67$.\nThis sum matches the required target value.

The corresponding Resonance Values are 17 and 42.\nLet's calculate the sum:\nSum = $17 + 42 = 59$.\nThis sum is not equal to 67.

The corresponding Resonance Values are 11, 34, and 8.\nLet's calculate the sum:\nSum = $11 + 34 + 8 = 45 + 8 = 53$.\nThis sum is not equal to 67.

However, our analysis of Option A in Step 1 showed that a valid combination exists.
