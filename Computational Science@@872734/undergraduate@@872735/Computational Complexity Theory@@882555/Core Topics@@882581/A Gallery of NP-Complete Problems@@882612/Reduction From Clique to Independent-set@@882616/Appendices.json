We will solve this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions. The input graph is $G = K_n$, the complete graph on a set of $n$ vertices, let's call it $V$. By definition, a complete graph has an edge between every pair of distinct vertices. So, for any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in V$, the edge $(u, v)$ is in the edge set of $K_n$.\n\nNext, we apply the reduction, which means we must construct the complement graph $G' = \\bar{G} = \\bar{K_n}$. The complement graph $\\bar{G}$ has the same vertex set $V$ as the original graph $G$. An edge $(u,v)$ exists in $\\bar{G}$ if and only if the edge $(u,v)$ does not exist in $G$.\n\nIn our case, $G = K_n$. Since $K_n$ contains all possible edges between its $n$ distinct vertices, there are no pairs of distinct vertices that are not connected by an edge. Consequently, the complement graph $\\bar{K_n}$ has no edges at all. A graph with $n$ vertices and zero edges is known as an empty graph or an independent graph.\n\nNow, we need to find the size of the largest independent set in this resulting graph, $G' = \\bar{K_n}$. An independent set is a subset of vertices of a graph, no two of which are adjacent. In other words, for any two vertices in the independent set, there is no edge connecting them.\n\nIn the graph $G' = \\bar{K_n}$, there are no edges whatsoever. This means that for any subset of vertices we choose, no two vertices in that subset will be connected by an edge. Therefore, any subset of vertices in $\\bar{K_n}$ is an independent set. The question asks for the largest possible independent set. The largest subset of vertices is the set of all vertices, $V$, which has a size of $n$.\n\nSo, the resulting graph $\\bar{K_n}$ is an empty graph, and the size of its largest independent set is $n$.\n\nFinally, we compare our conclusion with the given choices:\nA. The graph $\\bar{K_n}$ is a path graph, and the size of its largest independent set is $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$. (Incorrect)\nB.

For a graph $G=(V,E)$, the complement is $\\bar{G}=(V,\\bar{E})$ where for distinct $u,v \\in V$, $(u,v) \\in \\bar{E}$ if and only if $(u,v) \\notin E$. A clique in $G$ is a subset $K \\subseteq V$ such that for all distinct $u,v \\in K$, $(u,v) \\in E$. An independent set in a graph $H$ is a subset $I \\subseteq V(H)$ such that for all distinct $u,v \\in I$, $(u,v) \\notin E(H)$.\n\nConsider any clique $K \\subseteq V$ in $G$. By definition, for all distinct $u,v \\in K$, $(u,v) \\in E$. By the definition of complement, this is equivalent to $(u,v) \\notin \\bar{E}$. Therefore, in $\\bar{G}$, there are no edges among the vertices of $K$, so $K$ is an independent set in $\\bar{G}$. Hence, every clique in $G$ becomes an independent set in $\\bar{G}$, with the same cardinality.\n\nConversely, consider any independent set $I \\subseteq V$ in $\\bar{G}$. For all distinct $u,v \\in I$, $(u,v) \\notin \\bar{E}$, which by the complement definition is equivalent to $(u,v) \\in E$. Therefore, $I$ is a clique in $G$.
