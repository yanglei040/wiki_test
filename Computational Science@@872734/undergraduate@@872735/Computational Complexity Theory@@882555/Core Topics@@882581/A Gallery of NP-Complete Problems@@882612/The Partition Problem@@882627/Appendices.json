If the multiset $M$ can be partitioned into two subsets $A$ and $B$ with equal sums, let this sum be $S_{sub}$. Then, the sum of all elements in $M$, let's call it $S_{total}$, must be equal to the sum of the elements in $A$ plus the sum of the elements in $B$. That is, $S_{total} = S_{sub} + S_{sub} = 2S_{sub}$. This implies that for a perfect partition to exist, the total sum of all elements in the multiset must be an even number. The target sum for each subset will then be $S_{sub} = S_{total} / 2$.\n\nLet's calculate the total sum of the elements in $M$:\n$$S_{total} = 1 + 5 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 12 = 42$$\n\nThe total sum is 42, which is an even number. Therefore, an equal sum partition might exist. If it does, each of the two subsets must have elements that sum to the target value:\n$$S_{sub} = \\frac{S_{total}}{2} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21$$\n\nSo, the problem is now reduced to finding if there exists a subset of $M$ whose elements sum to 21. For a small multiset like this, one could try to find such a subset by an exhaustive search, iterating through all possible subsets of $M$. A systematic way to perform this search is to use bitmasking. The set has $n=6$ elements. We can represent each of the $2^6 = 64$ subsets by a 6-bit binary number, where the $i$-th bit being '1' signifies the inclusion of the $i$-th element of $M$ in the subset. We would then calculate the sum for each of the 64 subsets and check if any sum equals 21.\n\nHowever, since this is a multiple-choice question, a more direct approach is to check the sum of each of the provided options to see if it equals our target sum of 21.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. For the subset $\\{1, 8, 12\\}$:\nThe sum is $1 + 8 + 12 = 21$.\nThis sum matches our target sum $S_{sub}$. To confirm this is a valid partition, we can check the sum of the remaining elements. The remaining elements form the other subset, which is $\\{5, 5, 11\\}$. The sum of these elements is $5 + 5 + 11 = 21$. Since both subsets sum to 21, this is indeed a valid equal sum partition.\n\nB. For the subset $\\{1, 5, 5, 8\\}$:\nThe sum is $1 + 5 + 5 + 8 = 19$.\nThis does not match the target sum of 21.\n\nC. For the subset $\\{12, 11\\}$:\nThe sum is $12 + 11 = 23$.\nThis does not match the target sum of 21.\n\nD.

Such a partition is called a \"perfect partition\". The PARTITION problem is NP-hard, meaning there is no known algorithm that can solve it efficiently for all inputs.\n\nA common approach to this problem is a greedy heuristic known as the \"largest-first\" method.
