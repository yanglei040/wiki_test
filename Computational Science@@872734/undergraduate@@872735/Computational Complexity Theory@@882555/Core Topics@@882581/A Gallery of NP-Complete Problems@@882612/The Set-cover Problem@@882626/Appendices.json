That is, the condition $\\bigcup_{S_i \\in C} S_i = U$ must be satisfied. If no such sub-collection $C$ exists, the problem instance is said to have no solution.\n\nConsider a specific instance of the Set-Cover problem where the universe is $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ and the initial collection of subsets is $S = \\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$.
