This next practice is a classic thought experiment designed to illustrate this exact point, contrasting the result of the greedy First-Fit algorithm with the true optimal solution [@problem_id:1449894]. By working through it, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the trade-offs between computational speed and solution quality.", "problem": "A logistics company manages the shipment of goods using standard containers, each with a normalized capacity of 1 unit. The company has to ship two types of specialized items: 'Type A' items, which each occupy $2/3$ of a container's capacity, and 'Type B' items, which each occupy $1/3$ of a container's capacity.\n\nOn a particular day, an automated loading system receives a specific sequence of items to pack. First, a batch of 30 'Type B' items arrives, followed by a batch of 30 'Type A' items. The system employs a \"First-Fit\" greedy algorithm to pack the items in the order they arrive. The First-Fit algorithm works as follows: for each item, it attempts to place it into the first container (inspecting them in the order they were opened, from 1 upwards) that has sufficient remaining capacity. If no existing container can hold the item, a new, empty container is opened, and the item is placed inside.\n\nAn optimal packing strategy would achieve the absolute minimum number of containers required, possibly by reordering the items.\n\nCalculate the difference between the number of containers used by the First-Fit algorithm for the given sequence and the number of containers required for an optimal packing.", "solution": "Let $B_{FF}$ be the number of containers used by the First-Fit algorithm and $B_{OPT}$ be the number of containers used in an optimal packing. We need to calculate the difference $\\Delta B = B_{FF} - B_{OPT}$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculating the number of containers for the First-Fit algorithm ($B_{FF}$)**\n\nThe First-Fit algorithm processes the items in the sequence they are given: first 30 'Type B' items (size $1/3$), then 30 'Type A' items (size $2/3$).\n\n**Step 1.1: Packing the 30 'Type B' items.**\nEach 'Type B' item has a size of $1/3$. The algorithm will fill containers sequentially.\n- The first 'Type B' item goes into Container 1. Remaining capacity: $1 - 1/3 = 2/3$.\n- The second 'Type B' item also fits into Container 1. Remaining capacity: $2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3$.\n- The third 'Type B' item also fits into Container 1. Remaining capacity: $1/3 - 1/3 = 0$. Container 1 is now full.\n- The fourth 'Type B' item will not fit in Container 1, so the algorithm opens Container 2.\nThis pattern repeats. Each container can hold exactly three 'Type B' items ($3 \\times 1/3 = 1$).\nTo pack 30 'Type B' items, the number of containers required is:\n$$N_{B} = \\frac{30 \\text{ items}}{3 \\text{ items/container}} = 10 \\text{ containers}$$\nSo, after the first phase, we have 10 containers, all completely full.\n\n**Step 1.2: Packing the 30 'Type A' items.**\nNow, the 30 'Type A' items, each of size $2/3$, arrive.\nThe First-Fit algorithm will try to place the first 'Type A' item into existing containers, starting from Container 1.\n- Container 1 to Container 10 are all completely full (0 remaining capacity). A 'Type A' item (size $2/3$) cannot fit in any of them.\n- Therefore, for the first 'Type A' item, the algorithm must open a new container, Container 11.\n- The first 'Type A' item is placed in Container 11. Remaining capacity: $1 - 2/3 = 1/3$.\n- When the second 'Type A' item arrives, the algorithm checks existing containers. Container 1 to 10 are full. Container 11 has only $1/3$ capacity left, which is not enough for a size $2/3$ item.\n- Thus, the algorithm opens a new container, Container 12, for the second 'Type A' item.\nThis logic applies to all 30 'Type A' items. Each one will require its own new container because no two 'Type A' items can fit in the same container ($2 \\times 2/3 = 4/3 > 1$), and the remaining space in a container with one 'Type A' item is too small for another.\nThe number of new containers required for the 'Type A' items is 30.\n$$N_{A} = 30 \\text{ containers}$$\n\n**Step 1.3: Total containers for First-Fit.**\nThe total number of containers used by the First-Fit algorithm is the sum of containers from both phases.\n$$B_{FF} = N_{B} + N_{A} = 10 + 30 = 40$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the number of containers for an optimal packing ($B_{OPT}$)**\n\nFor an optimal packing, we are allowed to arrange the items in any order to minimize the number of containers used. The most efficient way to pack these items is to combine one 'Type A' item with one 'Type B' item in a single container.\nThe combined size of one 'Type A' and one 'Type B' item is:\n$$\\text{Size} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$$\nThis combination perfectly fills one container. We have 30 'Type A' items and 30 'Type B' items. We can therefore form 30 such pairs.\nEach pair will fill exactly one container. Thus, the minimum number of containers required is 30.\n$$B_{OPT} = 30$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculating the difference**\n\nThe difference between the number of containers used by the First-Fit algorithm and the optimal number is:\n$$\\Delta B = B_{FF} - B_{OPT} = 40 - 30 = 10$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1449894"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond heuristics, we can employ more powerful techniques to find the guaranteed optimal solution to the Bin Packing Problem, although often at a higher computational cost.

All modules must be placed into identical cargo containers of a fixed capacity. Due to the high cost of transportation, the primary goal is to minimize the total number of containers used.\n\nThe cargo manifest consists of a large number of modules, but they come in only a few distinct sizes. This structure allows for an optimization approach using dynamic programming. Consider a dynamic programming algorithm where a state is defined by a tuple $(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k)$, representing a subproblem where exactly $c_i$ modules of size $s_i$ have been packed for each module type $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$.\n\nThe value computed for each state, let's call it $DP(c_1, \\ldots, c_k)$, is a pair $(B, U)$. Here, $B$ is the minimum number of containers required to pack the specified modules, and $U$ is the total size of the modules placed in the *last* of these $B$ containers. The optimization criterion for comparing two states is lexicographical: a state $(B_1, U_1)$ is considered better than $(B_2, U_2)$ if $B_1  B_2$, or if $B_1 = B_2$ and $U_1  U_2$.\n\nThe process begins from the state of having packed no modules, which is defined as $DP(0, 0, \\ldots, 0) = (0, 0)$, representing zero containers used.\n\nYour task is to use this dynamic programming framework to solve the following specific instance:\n- The capacity of each container is $C = 10$ units.\n- There are $k=3$ distinct module sizes: $s_1 = 6$, $s_2 = 3$, and $s_3 = 2$.\n- The number of modules of each size are: $n_1 = 2$ of size $s_1$, $n_2 = 3$ of size $s_2$, and $n_3 = 2$ of size $s_3$.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of containers, $B$, required to pack all the modules.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of bins to solve a specific instance of the bin packing problem, using a provided dynamic programming formulation. The state of the dynamic programming is given by the tuple $(c_1, c_2, c_3)$, representing the number of items of each size ($s_1=6, s_2=3, s_3=2$) that have been packed. The DP function stores a pair $DP(c_1, c_2, c_3) = (B, U)$, where $B$ is the minimum number of bins and $U$ is the usage of the last bin. The goal is to compute $DP(2, 3, 2)$.\n\nThe recurrence relation is derived by considering the addition of one item to a previously solved subproblem. To compute $DP(c_1, c_2, c_3)$, we must have arrived from a state where one fewer item was packed. Let's say we transition from a state with tuple $(c'_1, c'_2, c'_3)$ by adding an item of size $s_j$. This means $(c'_1, \\ldots, c'_j, \\ldots, c'_3) = (c_1, \\ldots, c_j-1, \\ldots, c_3)$. Let $DP(c'_1, c'_2, c'_3) = (B', U')$.\n\nWhen we add the item of size $s_j$:\n1.  If $B' = 0$ (the base case), we must start a new bin. The new state is $(1, s_j)$.\n2.  If $B' > 0$ and the item fits in the last bin, i.e., $U' + s_j \\le C$, the new state is $(B', U' + s_j)$.\n3.  If $B' > 0$ and the item does not fit, i.e., $U' + s_j > C$, we must start a new bin. The new state is $(B' + 1, s_j)$.\n\nTo find $DP(c_1, c_2, c_3)$, we compute the resulting state from all possible previous states (i.e., for all $j$ where $c_j>0$) and take the lexicographically smallest result.\n$$DP(c_1, c_2, c_3) = \\min_{\\text{lex}} \\left\\{ \\text{update}(DP(c_1, \\ldots, c_j-1, \\ldots, c_3), s_j) \\mid j \\text{ s.t. } c_j > 0 \\right\\}$$\n\nLet's compute the values of the DP table bottom-up. $C=10, s_1=6, s_2=3, s_3=2$.

Result: $(1,6)$. So $DP(0,2,0) = (1,6)$.\n- By similar calculations, we fill the table. We will show a few key steps leading to the final answer.\n\n**Skipping to a state with multiple choices:**\n- $DP(1,2,0)$:\n  - From $DP(0,2,0)=(1,6)$, add $s_1=6$: $6+6=12 > 10$. New bin. Result: $(2,6)$.\n  - From $DP(1,1,0)=(1,9)$, add $s_2=3$: $9+3=12 > 10$. New bin. Result: $(2,3)$.\n  - $\\min_{\\text{lex}}((2,6), (2,3)) = (2,3)$. So, $DP(1,2,0) = (2,3)$.\n\n**Key values for the final steps:**\nWe need the results for subproblems with a total of 6 items to compute the final state with 7 items. The required previous states are $DP(1,3,2)$, $DP(2,2,2)$, and $DP(2,3,1)$.\n- $DP(1,3,2) = \\min_{\\text{lex}}\\{\\text{update}(DP(0,3,2),s_1), \\text{update}(DP(1,2,2),s_2), \\text{update}(DP(1,3,1),s_3)\\}$. Through systematic calculation (which is lengthy but follows the rules):\n  - $DP(0,3,2)=(2,3)$. Add $s_1=6 \\implies 3+6=9 \\le 10 \\implies (2,9)$.\n  - $DP(1,2,2)=(2,6)$. Add $s_2=3 \\implies 6+3=9 \\le 10 \\implies (2,9)$.\n  - $DP(1,3,1)=(2,8)$. Add $s_3=2 \\implies 8+2=10 \\le 10 \\implies (2,10)$.\n  - $DP(1,3,2) = \\min_{\\text{lex}}((2,9), (2,9), (2,10)) = (2,9)$.\n- Similarly, we find:\n  - $DP(2,2,2) = (3,3)$. This choice comes from $\\text{update}(DP(2,1,2)=(2,9), s_2=3)$ which gives $(3,3)$ versus other options leading to $(3,6)$ and $(3,4)$.\n  - $DP(2,3,1) = (3,5)$.\n\n**Final Step: Compute $DP(2,3,2)$**\nWe need to find the state for packing all items: 2 of size 6, 3 of size 3, and 2 of size 2.\nWe consider the three possibilities for the last item packed:\n1.  From $DP(1,3,2)=(2,9)$, add the last item of size $s_1=6$.\n    The last bin of state $(2,9)$ has usage 9. Adding an item of size 6: $9+6=15 > 10$. A new bin is required.\n    The resulting state is $(B', U') = (2+1, 6) = (3,6)$.\n\n2.  From $DP(2,2,2)=(3,3)$, add the last item of size $s_2=3$.\n    The last bin of state $(3,3)$ has usage 3. Adding an item of size 3: $3+3=6 \\le 10$. The item fits.\n    The resulting state is $(B', U') = (3, 3+3) = (3,6)$.\n\n3.  From $DP(2,3,1)=(3,5)$, add the last item of size $s_3=2$.\n    The last bin of state $(3,5)$ has usage 5. Adding an item of size 2: $5+2=7 \\le 10$. The item fits.\n    The resulting state is $(B', U') = (3, 5+2) = (3,7)$.\n\nNow we compare the three candidate final states: $(3,6)$, $(3,6)$, and $(3,7)$.\nThe lexicographically smallest state is $(3,6)$.\nTherefore, $DP(2,3,2) = (3,6)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of containers, which is the first component, $B$, of the final state pair.\n$B = 3$.\nThe total size of all items is $2 \\times 6 + 3 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 2 = 12 + 9 + 4 = 25$. The minimum possible number of bins is $\\lceil 25 / 10 \\rceil = 3$, so our DP result achieves this theoretical minimum.\nA possible packing is:\n- Bin 1: {6, 2, 2} (Total: 10)\n- Bin 2: {3, 3, 3} (Total: 9)\n- Bin 3: {6} (Total: 6)\nThis configuration uses 3 bins and matches our DP result of $B=3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1449858"}]}
