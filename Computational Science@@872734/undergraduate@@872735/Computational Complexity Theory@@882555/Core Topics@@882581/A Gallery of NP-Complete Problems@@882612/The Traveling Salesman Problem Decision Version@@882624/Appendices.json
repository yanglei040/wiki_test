In any Hamiltonian tour, each vertex has degree $2$. Vertex $x$ thus has exactly two incident edges in $C$. If $C$ uses any edge $(v,x)$ with $v \\notin \\{s,t\\}$, then $C$ includes an edge of weight $M$. Since $MK$ and all other edge weights are nonnegative (in fact positive on $G$), the total weight of $C$ would exceed $K$, a contradiction. Therefore the two edges incident to $x$ in $C$ must be $(s,x)$ and $(t,x)$, both of weight $0$. Removing $x$ and its two incident edges from $C$ yields a simple $s$-$t$ path $P$ visiting every vertex in $V$ exactly once. The cost of $P$ equals the cost of $C$ minus the two zero-weight edges, hence at most $K$. Thus there exists an $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian path in $G$ with total weight at most $K$.\n\n(If) Conversely, suppose there exists an $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian path $P$ in $G$ with total weight at most $K$. In $G'$, augment $P$ by adding the edges $(t,x)$ and $(x,s)$, both of weight $0$. This produces a Hamiltonian tour of $G'$ (a simple cycle visiting every vertex in $V \\cup \\{x\\}$ exactly once) whose total weight equals the weight of $P$ plus $0+0$, hence at most $K=B$.

Even if an $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian path of weight at most $K$ exists (so that closing it with $(s,t)$ yields a tour of weight at most $K$), the reverse implication fails because there might exist a Hamiltonian tour of cost at most $K$ that does not use the edge $(s,t)$. In that case, one cannot remove $(s,t)$ to obtain an $s$-$t$ path of the same cost, breaking the equivalence.\n\nOption C connects $x$ to every vertex with weight $0$, which does not constrain the two edges incident to $x$ in a TSP tour to be exactly $(s,x)$ and $(t,x)$. The tour may pick zero-weight edges incident to arbitrary vertices, yielding tours that do not correspond to an $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian path in $G$, so the equivalence fails.\n\nOption D leaves $G$ unchanged and sets $B=K$. This equates the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle of weight at most $K$ with the existence of an $s$-$t$ Hamiltonian path of weight at most $K$, which are in general incomparable properties; neither implication holds in general.\n\nTherefore, only option A is a correct and valid transformation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1464538"}]}
