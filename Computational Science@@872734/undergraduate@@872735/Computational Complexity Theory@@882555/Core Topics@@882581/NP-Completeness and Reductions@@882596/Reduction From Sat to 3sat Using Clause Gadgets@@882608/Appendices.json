Let $P = (x_1 \\lor x_2)$ and $Q = y$. The expression is $(P \\lor y) \\land (P \\lor \\neg y)$, which is logically equivalent to $P$, i.e., $(x_1 \\lor x_2)$.\nSince $\\phi'_{C}$ is logically equivalent to the original clause $C$, it is satisfied if and only if $C$ is satisfied. Furthermore, the transformation results in two clauses, $(x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor y)$ and $(x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor \\neg y)$, both of which have exactly three literals. Therefore, this is a valid transformation.

The clauses produced by this option, $(x_1 \\lor y)$ and $(x_2 \\lor \\neg y)$, have only two literals each.

The first clause $(x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor y)$ is always true. We need to check if we can satisfy the second clause $(\\neg x_1 \\lor \\neg x_2 \\lor \\neg y)$.\n  - Case 1: $x_1$ is true, $x_2$ is false. The second clause becomes $(\\text{false} \\lor \\text{true} \\lor \\neg y)$, which is true.\n  - Case 2: $x_1$ is false, $x_2$ is true. The second clause becomes $(\\text{true} \\lor \\text{false} \\lor \\neg y)$, which is true.\n  - Case 3: $x_1$ is true, $x_2$ is true. The second clause becomes $(\\text{false} \\lor \\text{false} \\lor \\neg y)$, which simplifies to $\\neg y$. We can satisfy this by setting $y$ to false.\n  So, if the original clause is satisfied, the new formula is satisfiable.\n- If $(x_1 \\lor x_2)$ is false: This happens when $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both false. The original clause is not satisfied. The new formula becomes $(\\text{false} \\lor \\text{false} \\lor y) \\land (\\text{true} \\lor \\text{true} \\lor \\neg y)$, which simplifies to $y \\land \\text{true}$, which is just $y$. This can be satisfied by setting $y$ to true.\nSimilar to option A, an assignment that makes the original clause false can lead to a satisfiable new formula. This violates the \"if and only if\" condition.
