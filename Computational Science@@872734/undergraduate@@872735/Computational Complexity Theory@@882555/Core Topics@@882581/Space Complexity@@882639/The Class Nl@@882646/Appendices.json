The set of edges $E$ represents direct, bidirectional communication links between these servers. A crucial maintenance task is to determine if two specific servers, a source $s$ and a target $t$, are in the same connected component of the network, which means a data packet could theoretically be routed between them.\n\nA junior engineer proposes the following non-deterministic algorithm to check for connectivity:\n1. Initialize a variable `current_node` to the label of the source server $s$. Initialize an integer counter `steps_taken` to 0. These are stored on a work tape.\n2. If `current_node` is equal to $t$, the algorithm halts and accepts.\n3. If `steps_taken` is equal to $n$, the algorithm halts and rejects. This prevents a non-terminating computation.\n4. Increment `steps_taken` by one.\n5. Non-deterministically select a server `next_node` that is a neighbor of `current_node` in the graph.\n6. Update `current_node` to the value of `next_node`.\n7. Go to step 2.\n\nAssume this algorithm is implemented on a non-deterministic Turing machine. The graph's structure is provided on a read-only input tape (for instance, as an adjacency list), which does not contribute to the space complexity of the algorithm. Your task is to determine the space complexity on the writable work tape required to execute this algorithm.

The space complexity is determined by the amount of memory needed to store the variables used by the algorithm during its execution. The input, representing the graph, is on a read-only tape and does not count towards this complexity. Let's analyze the memory requirements for each piece of information the algorithm needs to store on its work tape.\n\nThe algorithm uses two main variables: `current_node` and `steps_taken`.\n\nFirst, let's consider the variable `current_node`. This variable stores the label of the server the algorithm is currently visiting. The servers are labeled from $1$ to $n$. To store an integer value in the range $[1, n]$, we need a number of bits proportional to the logarithm of the range's size. Specifically, to represent any integer up to $n$ in binary, we need $\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ bits. In terms of Big-O notation, the space required to store `current_node` is $O(\\log n)$.\n\nSecond, let's analyze the space required for the counter `steps_taken`. This counter starts at 0 and is incremented at each step of the non-deterministic walk. The algorithm has a stopping condition (step 3) when `steps_taken` reaches $n$. Therefore, the maximum value this counter can hold is $n$. Similar to the `current_node` variable, storing an integer value up to $n$ requires $O(\\log n)$ space.\n\nThird, the algorithm at step 5 non-deterministically selects a neighbor, `next_node`. The machine might need some temporary scratch space to read a neighbor's ID from the input tape and hold it before overwriting `current_node`. The ID of any neighbor is also an integer between $1$ and $n$, so storing this temporary value also requires $O(\\log n)$ space.\n\nThe total space required on the work tape is the sum of the space needed for all the variables the algorithm must keep track of. This includes `current_node`, `steps_taken`, and any temporary variables used in the process.\n\nTotal space = Space for `current_node` + Space for `steps_taken` + Space for temporary variables\nTotal space = $O(\\log n) + O(\\log n) + O(\\log n)$\n\nThe sum of a constant number of $O(\\log n)$ terms is still $O(\\log n)$.\n\nTherefore, the total space complexity of the algorithm on the work tape is $O(\\log n)$. This means the problem of undirected s-t connectivity is in the complexity class NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $O(1)$: This would imply constant space, regardless of the number of servers $n$. This is incorrect, as we need to store server labels, whose size depends on $n$.\nB. $O(\\log n)$: This matches our derivation.\nC. $O(n)$: This would be the case if, for example, the algorithm needed to store the entire path it has traversed. The described algorithm cleverly avoids this by only storing the current location.\nD. $O(n \\log n)$: This might correspond to storing a path of length up to $n$, where each node ID requires $O(\\log n)$ space. Again, the algorithm does not do this.\nE. $O(n^2)$: This might be the space required to store an adjacency matrix representation of the graph on the work tape, which is not what the algorithm does.\n\nThus, the tightest upper bound among the choices is $O(\\log n)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1453163"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamental concept of reachability, we now examine a more intricate path-finding challenge where a path's validity depends on a specific property—in this case, the parity of special \"switcher\" vertices visited.

Note that the path includes both its start and end vertices. The number of switchers on a path is the count of vertices $v_i$ in the sequence that are also in the set $S$.\n\nThe **ODD-SWITCH-PATH** problem asks: given an instance $(G, S, s, t)$, does there exist at least one path from $s$ to $t$ that contains an odd number of switchers?\n\nWhich of the following represents the tightest, well-known complexity class that is proven to contain the **ODD-SWITCH-PATH** problem?\n\nA. **L** (Deterministic Logarithmic Space)\n\nB. **NL** (Non-deterministic Logarithmic Space)\n\nC. **P** (Polynomial Time)\n\nD. **NP** (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time)\n\nE. **PSPACE** (Polynomial Space)", "solution": "We first show containment in NL by giving a nondeterministic logarithmic-space algorithm that decides the language.

Correctness: If there exists a path $(v_{0},\\ldots,v_{m})$ from $s$ to $t$ with an odd number of vertices in $S$, then there exists a simple such path with $m \\leq k-1$; the machine can guess it and accept when $v = t$ and $b = 1$.

In this problem, you are given a set of $n$ tasks, denoted by $T = \\{t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_n\\}$, and a set of $m$ prerequisite dependencies, $D$. Each dependency is an ordered pair $(t_i, t_j)$, which signifies that task $t_i$ must be completed before task $t_j$ can begin. This system can be modeled as a directed graph $G=(V, E)$, where the vertices $V$ correspond to the tasks $T$, and a directed edge from vertex $t_i$ to vertex $t_j$ exists if and only if $(t_i, t_j)$ is a dependency in $D$.\n\nA valid sequential ordering of all tasks is only possible if the dependency graph does not contain any circular dependencies (e.g., Task A requires Task B, Task B requires Task C, and Task C requires Task A). Such a circular dependency corresponds to a directed cycle in the graph, which is a path of one or more edges that starts and ends at the same vertex. The **TASK-ORDERING-VALIDATION** problem is to decide whether a given set of tasks and dependencies is free of circular dependencies.

Formally, $ACYCLIC=\\overline{\\text{CYCLE}}$.\n\nStep 1 (Show $CYCLE \\in \\text{NL}$): We describe a nondeterministic log-space algorithm for $CYCLE$.\n- Nondeterministically choose a start vertex $v_{0} \\in V$ and store its index using $O(\\log n)$ bits.\n- Maintain a counter $c$ initialized to $1$ and bounded by $n$, stored in $O(\\log n)$ bits.\n- Maintain the current vertex $v$, initialized to $v_{0}$, stored in $O(\\log n)$ bits.\n- Repeat: nondeterministically choose an outgoing edge $(v,u) \\in E$ (by guessing a neighbor index and verifying it from the input), set $v \\leftarrow u$, and increment $c$. If at any step $v=v_{0}$ and $c \\geq 1$, accept. If $c$ exceeds $n$, reject on this branch.\nCorrectness: If $G$ has a directed cycle, then there exists a simple cycle of length $k$ with $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. The machine can guess that cycle by choosing $v_{0}$ on the cycle and the $k$ edges along it, thus reaching $v_{0}$ in at most $n$ steps and accepting. If $G$ has no cycle, then no sequence of at most $n$ edge traversals returns to $v_{0}$ after at least one step, so there is no accepting branch. Space: we store $v_{0}$, $v$, and the counter $c$, each in $O(\\log n)$ bits, plus constant workspace to scan the input and verify edges; hence total space is $O(\\log |input|)$. Therefore $CYCLE \\in \\text{NL}$.\n\nStep 2 (Complement and co-NL): Since $ACYCLIC=\\overline{CYCLE}$ and $CYCLE \\in \\text{NL}$, it follows that $ACYCLIC \\in \\text{co-NL}$ by definition of co-NL.\n\nStep 3 (Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem): By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, $\\text{NL}=\\text{co-NL}$. Therefore $ACYCLIC \\in \\text{NL}$ as well.\n\nStep 4 (Consistency with known polynomial-time algorithms): Independently, $ACYCLIC \\in \\text{P}$ via, for example, depth-first search or Kahn’s algorithm for topological sorting. This does not contradict the above and supports that the problem is not NP-hard under standard assumptions.
