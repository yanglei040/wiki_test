Your team is tasked with developing a service for scheduling customer jobs on a cluster of identical servers. Formally, this is the classic problem of scheduling jobs on parallel machines to minimize the makespan.\n\nYou are focusing on a promise-based decision version of the problem, which we will call `Gap-Makespan`. An instance of `Gap-Makespan` is defined by a set of $n$ jobs with known processing times {$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$}, a number of identical servers $m$, and a target deadline $T$.

That is, $C_{\\max}^{*}  T \\cdot g_{MS}$.\n\nYour task is to build a solver that can distinguish between these two cases.\n\nFortunately, your company has access to a proprietary software library, `CapacityOptimizer`. This library solves a gapped version of a bin packing problem, which we will call `Gap-Capacity`. An instance of `Gap-Capacity` is defined by a set of $n$ items with sizes {$s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n$}, a fixed number of bins $k$, and a target bin capacity $C$. The `CapacityOptimizer` library is guaranteed to correctly distinguish between the following two cases:\n1.  (YES-Instance) The minimum bin capacity required to pack all items into the $k$ bins is less than or equal to the target capacity $C$.\n2.  (NO-Instance) The minimum bin capacity required to pack all items into the $k$ bins is strictly greater than $C \\cdot g_{CO}$, where $g_{CO}  1$ is the library's built-in performance gap.\n\nFor any input that does not satisfy one of these two promises, the library's output is undefined.\n\nDescribe a procedure for solving an instance of the `Gap-Makespan` problem by making a call to the `CapacityOptimizer` library.

Analyzing this transformation allows you to see how the optimal solution scales predictably and to confirm that the gap is preserved, demonstrating a common pattern in reduction design.", "problem": "In computational complexity theory, we often study optimization problems through the lens of promise problems to analyze their hardness of approximation.\n\nConsider the minimum Set Cover problem. An instance is a pair $I = (U, S)$, where $U$ is a finite universe of elements and $S$ is a collection of subsets of $U$. The goal is to find a subcollection $S' \\subseteq S$ of minimum possible size such that the union of the sets in $S'$ covers the entire universe $U$. We denote the size of this minimum subcollection, the optimal solution, by $\\text{OPT}(I)$.\n\nLet's define a reduction, $f$, that takes a Set Cover instance $I=(U, S)$ and produces a new instance $I' = f(I) = (U', S')$. The new instance is constructed as follows:\n1.  For each element $u \\in U$, we create two new, distinct elements, $u_A$ and $u_B$. The new universe $U'$ is the set of all such newly created elements: $U' = \\{u_A \\mid u \\in U\\} \\cup \\{u_B \\mid u \\in U\\}$.\n2.

We then use this relationship to analyze the effect of the reduction on the problem's approximation gap.\n\nLet $I=(U, S)$ be the original instance and $I'=(U', S')$ be the new instance created by the reduction $f$. Let $\\text{OPT}(I)$ and $\\text{OPT}(I')$ be the sizes of the minimum set covers for $I$ and $I'$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we will establish the relationship between $\\text{OPT}(I')$ and $\\text{OPT}(I)$. We will do this in two parts: showing $\\text{OPT}(I') \\le 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$ and then showing $\\text{OPT}(I') \\ge 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$.\n\nPart 1: Showing $\\text{OPT}(I') \\le 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$.\nLet $C_{opt} = \\{S_{i_1}, S_{i_2}, \\dots, S_{i_k}\\}$ be an optimal set cover for the instance $I$. By definition, $|C_{opt}| = k = \\text{OPT}(I)$, and $\\bigcup_{j=1}^{k} S_{i_j} = U$.\nWe can construct a set cover for $I'$ based on $C_{opt}$. Consider the collection of sets $C' \\subseteq S'$ defined as:\n$C' = \\{S_{i_1, A}, S_{i_2, A}, \\dots, S_{i_k, A}\\} \\cup \\{S_{i_1, B}, S_{i_2, B}, \\dots, S_{i_k, B}\\}$.\nThe size of this collection is $|C'| = k + k = 2k = 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$.\nNow we must check if $C'$ is a valid cover for $U'$. The union of sets in $C'$ is:\n$$ \\bigcup_{S'' \\in C'} S'' = \\left( \\bigcup_{j=1}^{k} S_{i_j, A} \\right) \\cup \\left( \\bigcup_{j=1}^{k} S_{i_j, B} \\right) $$\nBy the construction of $S_{j,A}$, the first union covers all elements in $U_A$:\n$$ \\bigcup_{j=1}^{k} S_{i_j, A} = \\{u_A \\mid u \\in \\bigcup_{j=1}^{k} S_{i_j}\\} = \\{u_A \\mid u \\in U\\} = U_A $$\nSimilarly, the second union covers all elements in $U_B$:\n$$ \\bigcup_{j=1}^{k} S_{i_j, B} = \\{u_B \\mid u \\in \\bigcup_{j=1}^{k} S_{i_j}\\} = \\{u_B \\mid u \\in U\\} = U_B $$\nTherefore, the union of all sets in $C'$ is $U_A \\cup U_B = U'$. This means $C'$ is a valid set cover for $I'$. Since $\\text{OPT}(I')$ is the size of the *minimum* set cover, we must have $\\text{OPT}(I') \\le |C'|$.\nThus, we have shown $\\text{OPT}(I') \\le 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$.\n\nPart 2: Showing $\\text{OPT}(I') \\ge 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$.\nLet $C'_{opt}$ be an optimal set cover for $I'$. So, $|C'_{opt}| = \\text{OPT}(I')$.\nThe universe $U'$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets $U_A$ and $U_B$. A set in $S'$ of the form $S_{j,A}$ contains only elements from $U_A$, and a set of the form $S_{j,B}$ contains only elements from $U_B$. This means the problem of covering $U'$ can be perfectly decomposed into two independent subproblems: one covering $U_A$ using sets from $S_A = \\{S_{j,A}\\}_{S_j \\in S}$ and one covering $U_B$ using sets from $S_B = \\{S_{j,B}\\}_{S_j \\in S}$.\nLet $C'_A = C'_{opt} \\cap S_A$ and $C'_B = C'_{opt} \\cap S_B$. Since $S_A$ and $S_B$ are disjoint, $|C'_{opt}| = |C'_A| + |C'_B|$.\nThe sets in $C'_A$ must cover all of $U_A$. Let $C_A \\subseteq S$ be the collection of original sets corresponding to the sets in $C'_A$. The problem of finding a minimum cover for $U_A$ using sets from $S_A$ is structurally identical to finding a minimum cover for $U$ using sets from $S$. Therefore, the size of a minimal collection of sets from $S_A$ to cover $U_A$ is exactly $\\text{OPT}(I)$. This implies $|C'_A| \\ge \\text{OPT}(I)$.\nBy a symmetric argument, the sets in $C'_B$ must cover all of $U_B$, and the size of a minimal such collection must be $\\text{OPT}(I)$. This implies $|C'_B| \\ge \\text{OPT}(I)$.\nCombining these results, we get:\n$$ \\text{OPT}(I') = |C'_{opt}| = |C'_A| + |C'_B| \\ge \\text{OPT}(I) + \\text{OPT}(I) = 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I) $$\nSo we have shown $\\text{OPT}(I') \\ge 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$.\n\nCombining Part 1 and Part 2, we have $\\text{OPT}(I') \\le 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$ and $\\text{OPT}(I') \\ge 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)$, which means we must have the equality:\n$$ \\text{OPT}(I') = 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I) $$\n\nNow we analyze the gap transformation. We have a promise on $I$:\n- Case 1 (completeness): $\\text{OPT}(I) \\le k$.\nUsing our derived relationship, this implies $\\text{OPT}(I') = 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I) \\le 2k$. This matches the form $\\text{OPT}(I') \\le \\alpha \\cdot k$ with $\\alpha = 2$.\n- Case 2 (soundness): $\\text{OPT}(I)  c \\cdot k$.\nThis implies $\\text{OPT}(I') = 2 \\cdot \\text{OPT}(I)  2(c \\cdot k) = (2) \\cdot c \\cdot k$. This matches the form $\\text{OPT}(I')  \\beta \\cdot c \\cdot k$ with $\\beta = 2$.\n\nSince $\\alpha = 2$ and $\\beta = 2$, we have $\\alpha = \\beta$. This means the reduction is gap-preserving; it does not amplify the gap.\nThis corresponds to option B. Let's review the other options:\nA. Incorrect relationship for $\\text{OPT}(I')$.\nC. Incorrect value for $\\beta$. If $\\beta=1, \\alpha=2$, the gap would shrink, so it would be gap-reducing.\nD. Incorrect relationship for $\\text{OPT}(I')$.\nE. Incorrect. The subproblems are completely disjoint, so the optimal solution for the combined problem is exactly the sum of the optimal solutions for the subproblems.\n\nThus, the correct statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1425437"}, {"introduction": "A crucial aspect of gap-preserving reductions is understanding that the gap does not always stay the same size; it can also be compressed.
