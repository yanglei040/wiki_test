This exercise explores a common \"greedy\" strategy: repeatedly picking the vertex with the highest degree. By analyzing its performance on a cleverly designed graph, you will discover the pitfalls of such heuristics and see firsthand why they can lead to solutions that are far from optimal, reinforcing the deep challenge of approximation [@problem_id:1427955].", "problem": "A computer scientist is analyzing a greedy algorithm designed to find large cliques in a graph. The Maximum Clique problem is a well-known NP-hard problem, meaning no known efficient algorithm can find the absolute largest clique for all graphs.\n\nThe greedy algorithm is defined recursively as follows:\nGiven a graph $G$, if $G$ is empty, the algorithm returns an empty set. Otherwise, it selects a vertex $v$ that has the maximum degree in the current graph $G$. The algorithm then returns the clique formed by the union of $\\{v\\}$ and the clique returned by a recursive call on the subgraph induced by the neighbors of $v$. If there are multiple vertices with the same maximum degree, the algorithm's choice among them is arbitrary.\n\nTo test the limits of this algorithm, the scientist constructs a special graph $G$. This graph is built from three distinct components:\n1. A complete graph (a clique) $K_k$ on $k$ vertices.\n2. A simple cycle graph $C_m$ on $m$ vertices.\n3. A single, separate vertex, which we will call the \"hub\" vertex, $h$.\n\nThe final graph $G$ is formed by taking the disjoint union of $K_k$ and $C_m$, and then adding an edge between the hub vertex $h$ and every vertex in the cycle $C_m$. No edges are added between $K_k$ and any other part of the graph.\n\nFor this specific analysis, let the size of the clique be $k=16$ and the length of the cycle be $m=17$.\n\nYour task is to determine the approximation ratio of this greedy algorithm on the described graph $G$. The approximation ratio for a maximization problem is defined as the ratio of the size of the optimal solution (the maximum clique) to the size of the solution found by the algorithm.\n\nExpress your answer as a single real number, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "We first characterize vertex degrees in the constructed graph $G$ with parameters $k=16$ and $m=17$:\n- Each vertex in the clique $K_{k}$ has degree $k-1$, so for $k=16$ each such vertex has degree $15$.\n- Each vertex on the cycle $C_{m}$ has degree $2$ within $C_{m}$ and an additional edge to the hub $h$, hence degree $3$ in $G$.\n- The hub vertex $h$ is adjacent to all $m$ cycle vertices, so $\\deg(h)=m=17$.\n\nThe greedy algorithm chooses a vertex of maximum degree. Since $\\deg(h)=17$ is greater than the degree of any other vertex (15 for clique vertices, 3 for cycle vertices), the algorithm selects the hub vertex $h$ first.\n\nThe algorithm then makes a recursive call on the subgraph induced by the neighbors of $h$, which is the cycle $C_{17}$.\nIn $C_{17}$, all vertices have a degree of 2. The algorithm picks an arbitrary vertex, say $u$, from the cycle.\nNext, it recurses on the subgraph induced by the neighbors of $u$ within $C_{17}$. Since $m=17 \\ge 4$, the neighbors of $u$ are two non-adjacent vertices. Let's call them $v_1$ and $v_2$. The subgraph induced by $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ is just two vertices with no edge.\nIn this edgeless subgraph, both vertices have degree 0. The algorithm picks one, say $v_1$. It then recurses on the empty set of neighbors of $v_1$, which returns an empty clique. The call for $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ thus returns $\\{v_1\\}$.\nBack in the $C_{17}$ call, the algorithm returns $\\{u\\} \\cup \\{v_1\\}$. Since $u$ and $v_1$ are adjacent in $C_{17}$, this is a 2-clique.\nFinally, at the top level, the algorithm returns $\\{h\\} \\cup \\{u, v_1\\}$. Since $h$ is connected to all vertices in $C_{17}$ (including $u$ and $v_1$), and $u$ and $v_1$ are connected, $\\{h, u, v_1\\}$ is a 3-clique.\n\nTherefore, the size of the solution found by the greedy algorithm is $\\mathrm{ALG}=3$.\n\nNext, we determine the size of the optimal solution, $\\mathrm{OPT}$. The graph $G$ consists of two disconnected components: the clique $K_{16}$ and the \"wheel-like\" structure formed by $h$ and $C_{17}$.\nThe largest clique in the $K_{16}$ component is of size 16.\nThe largest clique in the other component consists of the hub $h$ and two adjacent vertices from the cycle $C_{17}$. This forms a triangle, a clique of size 3.

A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. The size of the largest such core is called the clique number of the graph, denoted $\\omega(G)$.\n\nTo aid your analysis, you have access to a special subroutine, `CoreDetector(H, k)`, which operates on a graph $H$ and an integer $k$. The `CoreDetector` is built on a principle of gapped detection; it is only guaranteed to work correctly if its input $(H, k)$ satisfies a \"gap promise\".

The analysis proceeds in two parts, corresponding to the two phases of the algorithm.\n\n**Phase 1: Bounding the True Clique Size**\n\nIn Phase 1, the algorithm finds the largest power of two, $k_{\\text{est}}$, for which `CoreDetector(G, k_{est})` returns `YES`. Let's analyze the implications of this.\n- The call `CoreDetector(G, k_{est})` returned `YES`. According to the detector's guarantees, a `YES` return means the input was not a guaranteed `NO` instance. Thus, the condition $\\omega(G)  k_{\\text{est}}/2$ must be false. This gives us our first inequality: $t \\ge k_{\\text{est}}/2$.\n- The algorithm selected the *largest* such power of two. This means that for the next power of two, $2k_{\\text{est}}$, the detector did *not* return `YES`. This could be because it returned `NO` or because its behavior was undefined. In either case, the condition for a guaranteed `YES` was not met. Therefore, the condition $\\omega(G) \\ge 2k_{\\text{est}}$ must be false. This gives our second inequality: $t  2k_{\\text{est}}$.\n\nCombining these two bounds, we have successfully \"sandwiched\" the true clique size $t$ using the estimate $k_{\\text{est}}$:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\text{est}}}{2} \\le t  2k_{\\text{est}} $$\nThis can be rearranged to give a bound on our estimate: $t/2  k_{\\text{est}} \\le 2t$.\n\n**Phase 2: Bounding the Reconstructed Clique Size**\n\nIn Phase 2, the algorithm iteratively builds a clique $C$. This process is a form of approximate self-reduction or self-correction. The algorithm adds a vertex $v_i$ to $C$ only if `CoreDetector(H_test, k_est)` returns `YES`.\n- A `YES` verdict for the test graph $H_{test}$ (induced by the neighbors of $v_i$ in the current candidate set) provides a guarantee: $\\omega(H_{test}) \\ge k_{\\text{est}}/2$.\n- This means that each time a vertex is added to $C$, the new, smaller candidate set is still guaranteed to contain a clique of size at least $k_{\\text{est}}/2$.\n\nThis process maintains an invariant: the current candidate set always induces a subgraph containing a clique of size at least $k_{\\text{est}}/2$. The algorithm stops when it can no longer find a vertex for which the detector returns `YES`. A full proof that this simple deterministic pass can build a large clique is complex and relies on careful handling of the oracle's behavior. However, a standard result for such approximate self-reduction procedures shows that they can successfully construct a solution whose size is proportional to the size of the clique promised by the oracle. In our case, this guarantees that the final clique $C$ will have a size of at least:\n$$ |C| \\ge \\frac{k_{\\text{est}}}{2} $$\nThis lower bound comes from the fact that as long as the remaining guaranteed clique is larger than the one we have built, at least one vertex from that clique should lead to a `YES` from the detector. The process can't stop prematurely, allowing it to build a clique of size proportional to $k_{\\text{est}}$.\n\n**Combining the Bounds**\n\nWe have a lower bound on the size of the found clique, $|C| \\ge k_{\\text{est}}/2$, and from Phase 1 we have a lower bound on our estimate, $k_{\\text{est}} > t/2$. Combining these gives the final result:\n$$ |C| \\ge \\frac{k_{\\text{est}}}{2} > \\frac{t/2}{2} = \\frac{t}{4} $$\nSince $t = \\omega(G)$, the algorithm is guaranteed to find a clique $C$ of size at least $\\omega(G)/4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1427944"}]}
