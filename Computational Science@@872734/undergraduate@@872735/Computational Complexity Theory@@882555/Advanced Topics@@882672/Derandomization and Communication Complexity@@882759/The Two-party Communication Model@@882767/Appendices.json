The grid locations are represented by integer coordinates $(x, y)$ where $1 \\le x \\le N$ and $1 \\le y \\le N$. Alice Corp and Bob Inc. each operate an autonomous delivery vehicle. At a certain moment, Alice's vehicle is at position $(x_A, y_A)$ and Bob's vehicle is at $(x_B, y_B)$.\n\nTo manage traffic and communication channel allocation, they need to determine if their vehicles are on the same North-South street. This is equivalent to checking if their x-coordinates are identical. The two parent companies decide to use a two-party communication protocol to determine this. Alice only knows her vehicle's coordinate $(x_A, y_A)$, and Bob only knows his vehicle's coordinate $(x_B, y_B)$.\n\nThey want to compute the function $SVL_N((x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B))$, which evaluates to 1 if $x_A = x_B$ and to 0 if $x_A \\neq x_B$. To establish a theoretical lower bound on the number of bits they must exchange, we can use the fooling set method.\n\nA set of input pairs $S = \\{ (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\dots, (a_k, b_k) \\}$, where $a_i$ is Alice's input and $b_i$ is Bob's input, is called a **fooling set** for a function $f$ if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  **Uniformity**: There is a constant value $c \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ such that for all pairs $(a_i, b_i) \\in S$, the function evaluates to this constant: $f(a_i, b_i) = c$.\n2.  **Fooling Property**: For any two distinct pairs $(a_i, b_i) \\in S$ and $(a_j, b_j) \\in S$ (i.e., $i \\neq j$), at least one of the \"crossed\" combinations of inputs gives a different result: $f(a_i, b_j) \\neq c$ or $f(a_j, b_i) \\neq c$.\n\nAssuming $N \\ge 4$, what is the size of the largest possible fooling set for the function $SVL_N$?\n\nA. 3\n\nB. $N-1$\n\nC. $N$\n\nD. $2N$\n\nE. $N^2$", "solution": "We formalize the function by\n$$\nSVL_{N}\\big((x_{A},y_{A}),(x_{B},y_{B})\\big)=\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } x_{A}=x_{B},\\\\\n0 & \\text{if } x_{A}\\neq x_{B}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nA fooling set $S=\\{(a_{i},b_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{k}$ for $SVL_{N}$ must satisfy:\n1) Uniformity: there exists a constant $c\\in\\{0,1\\}$ such that $SVL_{N}(a_{i},b_{i})=c$ for all $i$.\n2) Fooling property: for any $i\\neq j$, at least one of $SVL_{N}(a_{i},b_{j})\\neq c$ or $SVL_{N}(a_{j},b_{i})\\neq c$ holds.\n\nLower bound (achievability of size $N$ with $c=1$):\n- Impose $c=1$. Then for each pair $(a_{i},b_{i})=((x_{A}^{(i)},y_{A}^{(i)}),(x_{B}^{(i)},y_{B}^{(i)}))$ we must have $x_{A}^{(i)}=x_{B}^{(i)}$.\n- Consider the set\n$$\nS_{1}=\\left\\{\\big((x,1),(x,1)\\big): x\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}\\right\\}.\n$$\nUniformity holds since for every element of $S_{1}$, $x_{A}=x_{B}$, so $SVL_{N}=1$.\nFor any two distinct pairs with $x\\neq x'$, the crossed input $((x,1),(x',1))$ yields $x\\neq x'$, hence\n$$\nSVL_{N}\\big((x,1),(x',1)\\big)=0\\neq 1,\n$$\nwhich satisfies the fooling property. Therefore $|S_{1}|=N$ is a valid fooling set, so the largest possible size is at least $N$.\n\nUpper bound for any $c=1$ fooling set:\n- Let $S$ be any $c=1$ fooling set. Then for each $(a_{i},b_{i})$ we have $x_{A}^{(i)}=x_{B}^{(i)}$.\n- Suppose two distinct pairs $i\\neq j$ had the same $x$-coordinate, i.e., $x_{A}^{(i)}=x_{B}^{(i)}=x_{A}^{(j)}=x_{B}^{(j)}$. Then the crossed inputs satisfy\n$$\nSVL_{N}(a_{i},b_{j})=1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad SVL_{N}(a_{j},b_{i})=1,\n$$\nviolating the fooling property (since neither crossed value differs from $c=1$). Hence all $x$-values across the pairs in $S$ must be distinct, which implies $|S|\\leq N$.\n\nGlobal upper bound for any fooling set (including $c=0$):\n- Let $S$ be a $c=0$ fooling set. Write $u_{i}=x_{A}^{(i)}$ and $v_{i}=x_{B}^{(i)}$. Uniformity implies $u_{i}\\neq v_{i}$ for all $i$.\n- Suppose there exist $i\\neq j$ with $v_{i}=v_{j}$. Consider the two required crossed checks:\n$$\nSVL_{N}(a_{i},b_{j})=1 \\iff u_{i}=v_{j}=v_{i},\n$$\nand\n$$\nSVL_{N}(a_{j},b_{i})=1 \\iff u_{j}=v_{i}=v_{j}.\n$$\nBoth equalities would force $u_{i}=v_{i}$ or $u_{j}=v_{j}$, contradicting $u_{i}\\neq v_{i}$ and $u_{j}\\neq v_{j}$. Therefore both crossed evaluations equal $0$, violating the fooling property. Hence all $v_{i}$ must be pairwise distinct, so $|S|\\leq N$.\n\nCombining the bounds: there exists a fooling set of size $N$ (as constructed with $c=1$) and no fooling set can have size larger than $N$.

For example, Alice sends the $n$-bit string $x$ to Bob. Bob computes $\\operatorname{rev}(x)$ locally and compares it to his $y$. He outputs $1$ if $y=\\operatorname{rev}(x)$ and $0$ otherwise. Hence the communication cost of this protocol is $n$, so\n$$\nD(REV) \\leq n.\n$$\n\nLower bound: We use the fooling set method.
