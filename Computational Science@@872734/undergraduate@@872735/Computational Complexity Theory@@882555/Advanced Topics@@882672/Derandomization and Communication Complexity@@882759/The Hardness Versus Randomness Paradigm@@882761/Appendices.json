A key property of a secure PRG is that its output should be computationally indistinguishable from a truly random string of the same length.\n\nConsider a candidate generator, $G$. This generator takes a uniformly random $n$-bit string $x$ as its seed. It interprets this string as an integer, squares this integer, and then outputs the result as a $2n$-bit string. More formally, let $I(s)$ be the non-negative integer represented by a binary string $s$. The generator $G$ is defined by the mapping $G(x) = B_{2n}\\left( (I(x))^2 \\right)$, where $B_{k}(m)$ is the standard $k$-bit binary representation of the integer $m$, padded with leading zeros if necessary.\n\nA distinguisher, $D$, is an algorithm that attempts to tell apart the output of $G$ from a truly random string. We will use a simple distinguisher designed to exploit the algebraic structure of $G$. Upon receiving a $2n$-bit string $y$, the distinguisher $D$ outputs $1$ if the integer $I(y)$ is a perfect square, and it outputs $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe \"advantage\" of the distinguisher $D$, denoted $Adv(D)$, measures how effectively it can identify the generator's output.

You will explore a standard method for building a \"pairwise independent\" set of strings, a crucial tool for making randomized algorithms deterministic, and determine the efficiency of this construction.", "problem": "A team of computer scientists is working on derandomizing an algorithm. A key step involves replacing a large number of truly random inputs with a much smaller set of \"pseudorandom\" inputs that still preserve a specific statistical property. The algorithm takes an $n$-bit binary string as input. The required property is that for any two distinct bit positions, say position $i$ and position $j$ (where $1 \\le i  j \\le n$), the pair of bits appearing at these positions must be uniformly distributed across the entire set of pseudorandom inputs. That is, the four pairs (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) must each appear for exactly 25% of the inputs in the set.\n\nTo construct such a set of inputs, the team uses the following method.\n1. Find the smallest integer $k$ such that $n \\le 2^k - 1$.\n2. To each bit position $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, assign a unique non-zero binary vector $v_i$ of length $k$. (The condition on $k$ ensures there are enough unique non-zero vectors).\n3. The set of pseudorandom inputs is generated from \"seed\" pairs $(a, b)$, where $a$ is a binary vector of length $k$ and $b$ is a single bit (0 or 1).\n4. For each seed pair $(a, b)$, a single $n$-bit string $S$ is generated. The bit at position $i$ of this string, $S_i$, is calculated as the dot product of $a$ and $v_i$, with $b$ added, all modulo 2. That is, $S_i = (a \\cdot v_i + b) \\pmod 2$.\n\nSuppose the algorithm requires inputs of length $n=200$. Using the construction method described, what is the total number of pseudorandom input strings in the generated set?", "solution": "We need the smallest integer $k$ such that $n \\leq 2^{k} - 1$. For $n=200$, check $2^{7} - 1 = 127  200$ and $2^{8} - 1 = 255 \\geq 200$, hence $k=8$.\n\nEach seed is a pair $(a,b)$ with $a \\in \\{0,1\\}^{k}$ and $b \\in \\{0,1\\}$, so the total number of seeds is $2^{k} \\cdot 2 = 2^{k+1}$. For $k=8$, this equals $2^{9} = 512$.\n\nWe must verify that distinct seeds produce distinct $n$-bit strings so that the number of generated strings equals the number of seeds. Let $v_{1},\\dots,v_{n} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{k}$ be the assigned distinct non-zero vectors and define the $n \\times k$ matrix $M$ with $i$-th row $v_{i}^{\\top}$. The output string for seed $(a,b)$ is\n$$\nS = M a + b \\mathbf{1} \\quad \\text{over } \\mathbb{F}_{2},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}$ is the all-ones vector in $\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$.\n\nFirst, $\\operatorname{rank}(M) = k$. If $\\operatorname{rank}(M)  k$, then all $v_{i}$ lie in a proper subspace of $\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{k}$ of dimension at most $k-1$, which contains at most $2^{k-1} - 1$ non-zero vectors. For $k=8$, this bound is $127$, contradicting $n=200$. Hence $\\operatorname{rank}(M)=8$.\n\nSecond, $\\mathbf{1}$ is not in the column space of $M$. If there were $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2}^{k}$ with $M a = \\mathbf{1}$, this would mean $a \\cdot v_{i} = 1$ for all $i$. For any fixed non-zero $a$, exactly $2^{k-1}$ of the $2^{k}$ vectors in $\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{k}$ satisfy $a \\cdot x = 1$, and among the $2^{k}-1$ non-zero vectors, at most $2^{k-1}$ satisfy this. For $k=8$, this is $128$, which is less than $200$, so it is impossible that all $200$ chosen $v_{i}$ satisfy $a \\cdot v_{i} = 1$. Therefore $\\mathbf{1} \\notin \\operatorname{col}(M)$.\n\nThus the augmented matrix $[M \\mid \\mathbf{1}]$ has rank $k+1=9$, and the map $(a,b) \\mapsto S$ is injective.
