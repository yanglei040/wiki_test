Consider any feasible team $T$ with $|T| \\leq k$. If $x \\notin T$, then removing $x$ from the pool has no effect. If $x \\in T$, define $T' = (T \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\cup \\{y\\}$. Then $|T'| = |T| \\leq k$, and the set of skills covered by $T'$ contains all skills covered by $T$ because $S_{x} \\subset S_{y}$. Hence $T'$ is also feasible. If $T$ is a minimum-size feasible team, then $T'$ has the same size, so there exists an optimal team that does not use $x$. Therefore removing $x$ preserves feasibility and optimality for all $S_{req}$ and $k$. Conversely, removing $y$ is not safe in general because $y$ may possess skills not in $S_{x}$ that could be required by some $S_{req}$.\n\nApply the rule to the given pool:\n- Liam vs. Olivia: $S_{\\text{Liam}} = \\{\\text{Version Control}, \\text{API Design}\\}$ and $S_{\\text{Olivia}} = \\{\\text{Version Control}, \\text{API Design}, \\text{Testing}\\}$.

Instead of using sets to cover elements, our goal is to choose a small number of elements to \"hit\" or intersect with every given set. This exercise reveals a critical lesson in kernelization: the validity of a reduction rule depends intimately on the problem's objective. By comparing two sets where one is a subset of the other, you will see how the logic for simplification is inverted compared to the Set Cover problem, providing deeper insight into how problem constraints guide preprocessing. [@problem_id:1429634]", "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the $d$-Hitting Set problem is a classic decision problem. An instance of the problem is defined by a tuple $(U, \\mathcal{S}, k)$, where $U$ is a universe of elements, $\\mathcal{S} = \\{S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_m\\}$ is a collection of subsets of $U$ with each set $S_i$ having a size of at most $d$ (i.e., $|S_i| \\le d$), and $k$ is a positive integer. The question is whether there exists a \"hitting set\" $H \\subseteq U$ with size at most $k$ (i.e., $|H| \\le k$) that has a non-empty intersection with every set in the collection $\\mathcal{S}$ (i.e., $H \\cap S_i \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, m$).\n\nAs a preprocessing step for solving this problem, we often look for simplification rules that can reduce the size of the instance without changing the answer to the decision problem. Consider an instance of $d$-Hitting Set where for two distinct sets in the collection, $S_i \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and $S_j \\in \\mathcal{S}$, it is known that $S_j$ is a proper subset of $S_i$ (i.e., $S_j \\subset S_i$).\n\nWhich of the following statements describes a valid simplification that can be made to the instance while guaranteeing that the simplified instance has a \"yes\" answer if and only if the original instance does?\n\nA.

Any valid hitting set for the instance must contain at least one element from the set difference $S_i \\setminus S_j$.", "solution": "The problem asks for a valid reduction rule for the $d$-Hitting Set problem when one set in the input collection, $S_j$, is a proper subset of another, $S_i$. A reduction rule is valid if the modified instance is a \"yes\" instance if and only if the original instance is a \"yes\" instance. Let the original instance be $I = (U, \\mathcal{S}, k)$ and the proposed simplified instance be $I'$. We need to show that $I$ has a hitting set of size at most $k$ if and only if $I'$ does.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A: The set $S_i$ can be removed from the collection $\\mathcal{S}$.**\n\nLet the new instance be $I' = (U, \\mathcal{S}', k)$, where $\\mathcal{S}' = \\mathcal{S} \\setminus \\{S_i\\}$. We need to prove that a hitting set $H$ of size at most $k$ exists for $I$ if and only if a hitting set $H'$ of size at most $k$ exists for $I'$.\n\nFirst, assume a hitting set $H$ of size at most $k$ exists for the original instance $I$.\nBy definition, $H$ intersects every set in $\\mathcal{S}$. This includes every set in the sub-collection $\\mathcal{S}' = \\mathcal{S} \\setminus \\{S_i\\}$. Therefore, $H$ is also a valid hitting set for the instance $I'$. So, if $I$ is a \"yes\" instance, then $I'$ is also a \"yes\" instance.\n\nNext, assume a hitting set $H'$ of size at most $k$ exists for the simplified instance $I'$.\nBy definition, $H'$ intersects every set in $\\mathcal{S}'$. To show that $H'$ is also a hitting set for the original instance $I$, we only need to verify that $H'$ intersects the one set that was removed: $S_i$.\nSince $S_j \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and $S_j \\neq S_i$, it follows that $S_j \\in \\mathcal{S}'$. Because $H'$ is a hitting set for $I'$, it must intersect $S_j$. This means there is an element $x$ such that $x \\in H'$ and $x \\in S_j$.\nWe are given the condition that $S_j \\subset S_i$. By the definition of a subset, every element in $S_j$ is also in $S_i$. Since $x \\in S_j$, it must be that $x \\in S_i$.\nTherefore, $x \\in H' \\cap S_i$, which means $H'$ has a non-empty intersection with $S_i$.\nSince $H'$ intersects every set in $\\mathcal{S}'$ and also intersects $S_i$, it intersects every set in $\\mathcal{S}$. Thus, $H'$ is a valid hitting set for the original instance $I$. So, if $I'$ is a \"yes\" instance, then $I$ is also a \"yes\" instance.\n\nSince the existence of a solution is equivalent for both instances, this simplification is valid. The constraint imposed by $S_i$ is redundant because any set that \"hits\" the stricter constraint $S_j$ will automatically hit the looser constraint $S_i$.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: The set $S_j$ can be removed from the collection $\\mathcal{S}$.**\n\nThis is an invalid simplification. Consider a counterexample:\nLet the universe be $U = \\{a, b\\}$. Let the collection of sets be $\\mathcal{S} = \\{S_i, S_j\\}$ where $S_i = \\{a, b\\}$ and $S_j = \\{a\\}$, and let $k=1$. We have $S_j \\subset S_i$.\nThe simplified instance according to this rule would be $I' = (U, \\{S_i\\}, k)$, which is $(U, \\{\\{a, b\\}\\}, 1)$. A valid hitting set for $I'$ is $H' = \\{b\\}$.\nHowever, $H'=\\{b\\}$ is not a valid hitting set for the original instance $I$, because it does not intersect $S_j = \\{a\\}$.\nThe only valid hitting set for the original instance is $H=\\{a\\}$. By removing $S_j$, we changed the problem such that a new, incorrect solution appeared.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: Both sets $S_i$ and $S_j$ can be removed from the collection $\\mathcal{S}$.**\n\nThis is also invalid. If removing just $S_j$ is invalid (as shown above), then removing both $S_j$ and $S_i$ must also be invalid, as it removes a necessary constraint ($S_j$) from the problem. For instance, in the counterexample for Option B, removing both $\\{a,b\\}$ and $\\{a\\}$ leaves an empty collection of sets, for which the empty set is a valid hitting set of size 0. This is clearly not a solution to the original problem.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: All elements in the set difference $S_i \\setminus S_j$ can be removed from the universe $U$.**\n\nThis is an invalid simplification. Removing elements from the universe can eliminate valid solutions.\nConsider a counterexample:\nLet $U = \\{a, b, c\\}$. Let the collection be $\\mathcal{S} = \\{S_1, S_2\\}$ where $S_1 = \\{a, c\\}$ and $S_2 = \\{b\\}$. Also, let $S_i = \\{a,b\\}$ and $S_j=\\{a\\}$. The full collection is $\\mathcal{S}_{full} = \\{ \\{a,c\\}, \\{b\\}, \\{a,b\\}, \\{a\\} \\}$. Let $k=2$.\nThe set difference is $S_i \\setminus S_j = \\{a,b\\} \\setminus \\{a\\} = \\{b\\}$. The rule suggests removing the element $b$ from the universe.\nThe original instance has a valid hitting set $H = \\{b, c\\}$ of size 2. $H$ hits $\\{a,c\\}$ with $c$, and it hits $\\{b\\}$, $\\{a,b\\}$, and $\\{a\\}$ with $b$.\nLet's apply the rule. We remove $b$ from $U$. The new universe is $U'=\\{a,c\\}$. The sets become:\n$S_1' = \\{a, c\\}$\n$S_2' = \\emptyset$ (Problematic! A hitting set cannot intersect an empty set. Many definitions of Hitting Set require sets to be non-empty. Let's assume non-empty sets to avoid this degeneracy and refine the example).\n\nRefined counterexample:\nLet $U=\\{a,b,c\\}$ and $\\mathcal{S} = \\{ \\{a, b\\}, \\{a\\}, \\{b, c\\} \\}$. Let $k=1$.\nHere, $S_i = \\{a,b\\}$ and $S_j = \\{a\\}$. The set difference is $S_i \\setminus S_j = \\{b\\}$. The rule suggests removing $b$ from the universe $U$.\nThe original problem asks for a hitting set of size 1 for $\\{\\{a,b\\}, \\{a\\}, \\{b,c\\}\\}$. The only solution is $H=\\{b\\}$. It hits $\\{a,b\\}$ and $\\{b,c\\}$ with $b$, and is not required to hit $\\{a\\}$ as per our analysis of option A (we could remove $\\{a,b\\}$). The actual sets to hit are $\\{a\\}$ and $\\{b,c\\}$. This has no hitting set of size 1. Let's change $k=2$. A solution is $\\{a,b\\}$.\nLet's try a clearer example. $U=\\{a,b,d\\}$, $\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\{a,d\\}, \\{b,d\\}\\}$. $k=1$. Solution: $H=\\{d\\}$.\nNow, add $S_i=\\{a,c\\}$ and $S_j=\\{a\\}$. The instance is $\\mathcal{S}' = \\{\\{a,d\\}, \\{b,d\\}, \\{a,c\\}, \\{a\\}\\}$. $S_i \\setminus S_j = \\{c\\}$. The rule says to remove $c$ from $U$.\nNew instance: $U'=\\{a,b,d\\}$, $\\mathcal{S}'' = \\{\\{a,d\\}, \\{b,d\\}, \\{a\\}, \\{a\\}\\}$. The problem is to hit $\\{\\{a,d\\},\\{b,d\\},\\{a\\}\\}$. A hitting set of size 2 is $\\{a,d\\}$.\nOriginal instance: $\\mathcal{S}' = \\{\\{a,d\\}, \\{b,d\\}, \\{a,c\\}, \\{a\\}\\}$. A hitting set of size 2 could be $\\{c,d\\}$. By removing $c$, this valid solution is destroyed. Thus, this rule is invalid.\n\n**Analysis of Option E: Any valid hitting set for the instance must contain at least one element from the set difference $S_i \\setminus S_j$.**\n\nThis is false. A hitting set must intersect $S_j$. If it does so by picking an element $x \\in S_j$, then it has also intersected $S_i$ (since $x \\in S_j \\implies x \\in S_i$). There is no necessity to pick an element from $S_i \\setminus S_j$ to satisfy the constraints related to $S_i$ or $S_j$. For example, let $U=\\{a, b, c\\}$, $\\mathcal{S}=\\{\\{a, b\\}, \\{a\\}, \\{c\\}\\}$, and $k=2$. Here $S_i=\\{a,b\\}$ and $S_j=\\{a\\}$. The set difference is $\\{b\\}$. A valid hitting set is $H=\\{a,c\\}$. This set does not contain any element from the set difference $S_i \\setminus S_j = \\{b\\}$.
