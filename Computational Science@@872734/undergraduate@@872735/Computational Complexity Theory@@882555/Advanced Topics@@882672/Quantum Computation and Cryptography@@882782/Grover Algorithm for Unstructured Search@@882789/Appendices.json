This exercise demystifies this abstract component by challenging you to construct a functional oracle for a specific marked state using a set of basic quantum gates [@problem_id:1426395]. Successfully building this circuit provides a concrete understanding of how the crucial \"marking\" step is physically realized in a quantum computer.", "problem": "In the development of a quantum search algorithm for a 3-qubit system, a key component is the \"oracle\" operator, $U_w$. This operator is designed to identify a specific \"marked\" computational basis state, $|w\\rangle$, by applying a phase shift of $-1$ to it, while leaving all other basis states unchanged. The action of the oracle is formally described by the transformation $U_w|x\\rangle = (-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle$, where $f(x)=1$ if the input state $|x\\rangle$ is the marked state $|w\\rangle$, and $f(x)=0$ otherwise.\n\nConsider a 3-qubit register where the qubits are indexed from right to left, such that a general basis state is written as $|q_2 q_1 q_0\\rangle$. The marked state for our search problem is $|w\\rangle = |110\\rangle$.\n\nYou are provided with a library of elementary quantum gates to construct the oracle. This library includes:\n1.  A single-qubit Pauli-X gate, denoted as $X_k$, which acts on qubit $k$. This gate flips the state of the qubit, such that $X_k|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle$ and $X_k|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle$.\n2.  A three-qubit doubly-controlled-Z gate, denoted as $CCZ_{i,j,k}$. This gate applies a Pauli-Z gate to a target qubit $k$ if and only if both control qubits $i$ and $j$ are in the state $|1\\rangle$. The Pauli-Z gate applies a phase flip to the $|1\\rangle$ state ($Z|1\\rangle = -|1\\rangle$) and leaves the $|0\\rangle$ state unchanged ($Z|0\\rangle = |0\\rangle$). Consequently, the $CCZ_{i,j,k}$ gate applies a phase of $-1$ only to the basis state where qubits $i, j, k$ are all $|1\\rangle$.\n\nGate sequences are written in the order of application from right to left. For example, the sequence $A \\cdot B \\cdot C$ means that gate $C$ is applied first, followed by gate $B$, and finally gate $A$.\n\nWhich of the following gate sequences correctly implements the required oracle for the marked state $|w\\rangle = |110\\rangle$?\n\nA. $CCZ_{2,1,0}$\n\nB. $X_0 \\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0} \\cdot X_0$\n\nC. $X_2 \\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0} \\cdot X_2$\n\nD. $X_1 \\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0} \\cdot X_1$\n\nE. $X_2 \\cdot X_1 \\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0} \\cdot X_1 \\cdot X_2$", "solution": "We require an oracle $U_{w}$ that acts on computational basis states as\n$$\nU_{w}|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle =\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\,|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle, & \\text{if } |q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle=|110\\rangle,\\\\\n\\;\\;|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nEquivalently, for bit values $q_{k}\\in\\{0,1\\}$, this is\n$$\nU_{w}|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle = (-1)^{q_{2}q_{1}(1-q_{0})}|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle,\n$$\nso only the state with $q_{2}=1$, $q_{1}=1$, $q_{0}=0$ acquires a phase of $-1$.\n\nThe available $CCZ_{2,1,0}$ gate applies a phase $-1$ only to $|111\\rangle$, i.e.,\n$$\nCCZ_{2,1,0}|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle = (-1)^{q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}}|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle.\n$$\nTo shift the marked pattern from $|111\\rangle$ to $|110\\rangle$, we conjugate $CCZ_{2,1,0}$ by $X_{0}$, flipping the third qubit (the target) before and after:\n$$\nU := X_{0}\\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0}\\cdot X_{0}.\n$$\nActing on a general basis state,\n1) The rightmost $X_{0}$ maps $|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle$ to $|q_{2}q_{1}\\bar{q}_{0}\\rangle$ with $\\bar{q}_{0}=1-q_{0}$.\n2) Then $CCZ_{2,1,0}$ contributes a phase $-1$ if and only if $q_{2}=1$, $q_{1}=1$, and $\\bar{q}_{0}=1$, i.e., precisely when $q_{2}=1$, $q_{1}=1$, $q_{0}=0$.\n3) The leftmost $X_{0}$ restores the third qubit, yielding the original basis state and the intended phase.\n\nHence\n$$\n\\left(X_{0}\\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0}\\cdot X_{0}\\right)|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle\n= (-1)^{q_{2}q_{1}(1-q_{0})}|q_{2}q_{1}q_{0}\\rangle,\n$$\nwhich is exactly the desired oracle for the marked state $|110\\rangle$.\n\nVerification of other options:\n- $CCZ_{2,1,0}$ alone marks $|111\\rangle$, not $|110\\rangle$.\n- $X_{2}\\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0}\\cdot X_{2}$ marks states with $q_{2}=0$, $q_{1}=1$, $q_{0}=1$, i.e., $|011\\rangle$.\n- $X_{1}\\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0}\\cdot X_{1}$ marks $|101\\rangle$.\n- $X_{2}\\cdot X_{1}\\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0}\\cdot X_{1}\\cdot X_{2}$ marks $|001\\rangle$.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is $X_{0}\\cdot CCZ_{2,1,0}\\cdot X_{0}$, which is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1426395"}, {"introduction": "Once the oracle is built, we can explore the dynamics of the full Grover's algorithm.
