If every signal at depth at most $k-1$ depends on at most $2^{k-1}$ inputs, then a gate at depth $k$ has two inputs, each depending on at most $2^{k-1}$ inputs; hence its output depends on at most $2 \\cdot 2^{k-1} = 2^{k}$ inputs.

To be $1$ for all one-hot assignments, $S$ must equal $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, i.e., the global OR. Any conjunction of such OR leaves is still $1$ on any assignment with at least one $1$, including those with two or more $1$s, so the top AND cannot reject multi-one assignments.\nTherefore depth $2$ is impossible.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, the minimum possible constant depth is $3$ for all $n \\ge 2$.

Does having a full set of {AND, OR, NOT} gates give us an inherent advantage over a more restricted set? By examining the PARITY function, this exercise demonstrates a powerful circuit transformation technique using De Morgan's laws, revealing that the logarithmic depth for this function is remarkably robust, even when NOT gates are restricted to the input level.

Let this standard circuit be called $C$. Our goal is to see if we can transform $C$ into an equivalent circuit $C'$ that adheres to the new rules (only AND/OR gates, inputs from $\\{x_i, \\bar{x}_i\\}$) without significantly increasing the depth.\n\nThe key insight is to use De Morgan's laws to eliminate all NOT gates from the interior of the circuit, except for those applied directly to the input variables. The laws are:\n1.  $\\overline{A \\land B} = \\bar{A} \\lor \\bar{B}$\n2.  $\\overline{A \\lor B} = \\bar{A} \\land \\bar{B}$\nAdditionally, the double negation law states $\\overline{\\bar{A}} = A$.\n\nWe can apply these laws systematically to any circuit $C$ to push all negation operations from the interior of the circuit down to the input level. Let's trace this process. We can traverse the circuit $C$ from its output gate downwards. Whenever we encounter a NOT gate, we apply the appropriate De Morgan's law to the gate that feeds into it.\n\nFor example, if a part of the circuit computes $\\overline{g(y_1, y_2)}$, where $g$ is an AND gate (i.e., $g(y_1, y_2) = y_1 \\land y_2$), we can replace the structure with an OR gate whose inputs are $\\bar{y}_1$ and $\\bar{y}_2$. The NOT gate at the output of $g$ is effectively replaced by two NOT gates at its inputs. We can repeat this process for the subcircuits computing $y_1$ and $y_2$.\n\nThis procedure continues until all NOT gates are either eliminated (by the double negation rule) or have been pushed all the way to the input variables of the circuit. The resulting circuit, let's call it $C'$, computes the exact same function as $C$.\n\nNow, we must analyze the effect of this transformation on the circuit's depth. When we apply a De Morgan's law, we replace a gate and a subsequent NOT gate with a different gate whose inputs are negated. For instance, an AND gate followed by a NOT gate is replaced by an OR gate. The inputs to this new OR gate are the negated versions of the inputs to the original AND gate. The depth of the path through this local transformation does not increase. A path of length 2 (one gate, one NOT) is replaced by a path of length 1 (one gate), with the negations moved to its inputs. As this process is repeated, the length of any path from an input to the output in the circuit does not increase. Therefore, the depth of the transformed circuit $C'$ is no greater than the depth of the original circuit $C$.\n\nSo, if the original $\\text{PARITY}_n$ circuit $C$ had depth $\\Theta(\\log n)$, the new circuit $C'$ has a depth of at most $\\Theta(\\log n)$, which means its depth is $O(\\log n)$. The circuit $C'$ uses only AND and OR gates, and its inputs are of the form $x_i$ or $\\bar{x}_i$. This matches the requirements of the problem.\n\nWe have established an upper bound of $O(\\log n)$. Now we need to determine if this is a tight bound, i.e., is the depth also $\\Omega(\\log n)$?\nA circuit with gates of fan-in 2 and depth $d$ can have at most $2^d$ inputs. The PARITY function depends on all $n$ of its inputs (changing any single input bit flips the output). Therefore, to compute a function that depends on $n$ variables, a circuit must have at least $n$ inputs that can influence the output. The number of inputs that can influence the output is bounded by the number of leaf nodes, which is at most $2^d$. So, we must have $2^d \\ge n$, which implies $d \\ge \\log_2 n$.\nThis gives a lower bound on the depth of $\\Omega(\\log n)$ for any circuit with bounded fan-in that computes PARITY.\n\nSince we have shown that the depth is both $O(\\log n)$ and $\\Omega(\\log n)$, the tightest asymptotic bound on the minimum possible depth is $\\Theta(\\log n)$. The restriction on the gate set, when compensated by providing negated inputs, does not asymptotically increase the minimum depth required to compute the PARITY function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1415216"}]}
