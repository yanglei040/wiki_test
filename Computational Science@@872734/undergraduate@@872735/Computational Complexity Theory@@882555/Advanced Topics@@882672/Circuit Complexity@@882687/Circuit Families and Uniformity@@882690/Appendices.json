This first practice provides a foundational exercise: constructing a minimal circuit to recognize a single, unique binary string [@problem_id:1414500]. Understanding how to build such a \"recognizer\" is key, as it directly translates a specific logical condition into hardware and serves as a building block for more complex computations.", "problem": "A security system uses a special set of binary strings called 'access codes'. For any given positive integer length $n$, there exists exactly one valid access code of that length. A hardware verifier for a given length $n$ is implemented as a Boolean circuit, denoted $C_n$. This circuit takes an $n$-bit string as input and outputs 1 if the string is the valid access code of length $n$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThese circuits are constructed using only the following standard gates: 2-input AND gates, 2-input OR gates, and 1-input NOT gates. The 'size' of a circuit is defined as the total number of gates it contains.\n\nFor the specific length $n=12$, the valid access code is given by the string $s = 110100101110$.\n\nCalculate the minimum possible size for the circuit $C_{12}$ that correctly identifies this access code.", "solution": "Let the input be $x=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{12})$ and the unique accepting string be $s=110100101110$.

Since a $k$-input AND using only $2$-input AND gates needs at least $k-1$ gates, the conjunction requires $12-1=11$ AND gates. The string $s$ has zeros at positions $3,5,6,8,12$, hence exactly $5$ negated literals, so exactly $5$ NOT gates are needed. This gives a circuit of size $11+5=16$.\n\nTo see optimality:\n- Any circuit that outputs $1$ only when $x=s$ must enforce all $12$ literal constraints; combining $12$ independent inputs to one output with only $2$-input gates needs at least $11$ binary gates (each such gate can reduce the number of separate components by at most one).\n- For each index $i$ with $s_{i}=0$, the function is decreasing in $x_{i}$, so some occurrence of $\\neg x_{i}$ must appear on a path to the output; otherwise the circuit would be monotone in $x_{i}$ and could not distinguish $x_{i}=0$ from $x_{i}=1$ at the unique accepting assignment. Each such variable needs at least one NOT gate, and a single NOT can invert only one signal, so at least $5$ NOT gates are necessary.\n\nThus any implementation has size at least $11+5=16$, and the construction above achieves this bound. No use of OR gates can reduce this count, since the minimal representation already uses the minimal number of binary gates and negations for this unate minterm.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible size is $16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "1414500"}, {"introduction": "Beyond designing individual circuits, a crucial aspect of circuit complexity is understanding how they can be combined.
