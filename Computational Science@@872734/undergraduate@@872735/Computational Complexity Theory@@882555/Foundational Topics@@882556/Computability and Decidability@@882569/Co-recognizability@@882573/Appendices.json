The claim is true. Let $L$ be a co-recognizable language and $h$ be a homomorphism. By definition, the complement of $h^{-1}(L)$ is the set $\\{w \\mid h(w) \\notin L\\}$, which is equivalent to $h^{-1}(\\overline{L})$. Since $L$ is co-recognizable, its complement $\\overline{L}$ is recognizable.

Therefore, the complement of $h^{-1}(L)$ is recognizable, so $h^{-1}(L)$ must be co-recognizable.\n\nB. The claim is false. The operation of inverse homomorphism can increase the complexity of a language. For instance, let $L$ be the context-free language $\\{a^n b^n \\mid n \\geq 0 \\}$, which is decidable and thus co-recognizable. It is possible to construct a homomorphism $h$ such that the language $h^{-1}(L)$ is a known non-co-recognizable language. Therefore, the class is not closed under this operation.\n\nC. The claim is false. The class of co-recognizable languages is known not to be closed under (direct) homomorphism. Since inverse homomorphism is a structurally similar string operation, closure is not expected to hold for it either. A standard technique to prove non-closure for homomorphism can be adapted to show that applying an inverse homomorphism can transform a co-recognizable language into one that is not co-recognizable.\n\nD. The claim is true, but the reasoning is flawed. A common but incorrect argument is as follows: To construct a Turing Machine $M_{new}$ for $h^{-1}(L)$, a student might suggest that on input $w$, $M_{new}$ computes $z = h(w)$ and then simulates a recognizer for $L$ itself, let's call it $M_L$, on input $z$. The problem is that if $L$ is co-recognizable but not decidable, a recognizer $M_L$ for $L$ is not guaranteed to exist, so this construction fails.\n\nE. The claim is true only if the language $L$ is decidable (i.e., both recognizable and co-recognizable). If $L$ is merely co-recognizable but not decidable, then the Turing machine for its complement $\\overline{L}$ is only a recognizer, not a decider. The simulation required to check membership in $h^{-1}(\\overline{L})$ may not halt on all inputs, and this non-halting behavior prevents the construction of a valid machine to co-recognize $h^{-1}(L)$.", "solution": "We begin with definitions.

Define a Turing machine $M'$ that, on input $w \\in \\Sigma_{1}^{*}$, computes $h(w)$ and then simulates $M$ on $h(w)$; $M'$ accepts exactly when $M$ accepts. Since a fixed homomorphism $h$ is a total computable function (obtained by per-symbol substitution and concatenation), $M'$ recognizes $h^{-1}(A)$. Hence, if $A$ is recognizable, then $h^{-1}(A)$ is recognizable.\n\nNow let $L$ be co-recognizable. Then $\\overline{L}$ is recognizable.

The correct reasoning uses a recognizer for $\\overline{L}$ and closure of recognizable languages under inverse homomorphism.
