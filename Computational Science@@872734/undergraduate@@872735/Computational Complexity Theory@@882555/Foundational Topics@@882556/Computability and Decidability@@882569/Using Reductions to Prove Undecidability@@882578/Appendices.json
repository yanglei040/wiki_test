This technique is called a reduction. A foundational undecidable problem is the Acceptance Problem for Turing Machines (TM), denoted as $A_{TM}$. The language $A_{TM}$ is defined as the set of pairs $\\langle M, w \\rangle$ where $M$ is a description of a Turing Machine and $w$ is an input string that $M$ accepts.\n\nLet's consider a new decision problem related to a specific property of formal languages. A natural number $n$ is called a **semiprime** if it is the product of two prime numbers (the two primes are not necessarily distinct). For example, $4 = 2 \\times 2$, $6 = 2 \\times 3$, and $9 = 3 \\times 3$ are semiprimes, while $1$, $7$, and $12$ are not.\n\nNow, define the language $SEMIPRIME_{ONLY}$ as follows:\n$SEMIPRIME_{ONLY} = \\{ \\langle M \\rangle \\mid M \\text{ is a TM where } L(M) \\text{ is not empty, and for every string } s \\in L(M), \\text{ the length } |s| \\text{ is a semiprime number} \\}$.\n\nTo prove that $SEMIPRIME_{ONLY}$ is undecidable, we can construct a reduction from $A_{TM}$. The strategy is to take an arbitrary instance $\\langle M, w \\rangle$ of $A_{TM}$ and transform it into an instance $\\langle M' \\rangle$ for $SEMIPRIME_{ONLY}$ such that $M$ accepts $w$ if and only if $\\langle M' \\rangle \\in SEMIPRIME_{ONLY}$.\n\nThe constructed machine $M'$ takes a string $x$ as its input. Its behavior is defined by the following high-level algorithm:\n\n**Algorithm for $M'(x)$:**\n1.  On input $x$, first simulate the machine $M$ on the fixed string $w$.\n2.  If the simulation of $M$ on $w$ halts and accepts:\n    Execute a procedure called `ACCEPT_BEHAVIOR` on the original input $x$.\n3.

Consider the language $A_{TM} = \\{ \\langle M, w \\rangle \\mid M \\text{ is a Turing Machine (TM) that accepts the input string } w \\}$.

This requires a procedure that takes an instance of an $A_{TM}$ problem, $\\langle M, w \\rangle$, and constructs an instance of an $L_{REP\\_SYM}$ problem, $\\langle M' \\rangle$, such that:\n$M$ accepts $w$ if and only if $M'$, when run on the empty string $\\epsilon$, writes the same non-blank symbol twice in a row.\n\nBelow are four different proposals for constructing the machine $M'$. Which of these proposed constructions for $M'$ would correctly establish the undecidability of $L_{REP\\_SYM}$ via a reduction from $A_{TM}$?\n\nA. On input $\\epsilon$, the machine $M'$ simulates the execution of machine $M$ on input $w$. If the simulation shows that $M$ halts and accepts $w$, a special sequence of states is entered in $M'$ which causes it to write the symbol '1' twice in a row and then halt.\n\nB. On input $\\epsilon$, the machine $M'$ examines the encoding of the machine $M$, $\\langle M \\rangle$. If the string $\\langle M \\rangle$ contains any character repeated twice in a row, $M'$ writes the symbol '1' twice in a row and halts. Otherwise, $M'$ immediately halts without writing anything.\n\nC. On input $\\epsilon$, the machine $M'$ simulates the execution of machine $M$ on input $w$. For any symbol $\\sigma$ in the tape alphabet of $M$, $M'$ uses two new symbols, $\\sigma_A$ and $\\sigma_B$, in its own alphabet. When simulating a write of $\\sigma$ by $M$, $M'$ alternates between writing $\\sigma_A$ and $\\sigma_B$ to ensure no non-blank symbol is repeated during this phase. If the simulation of $M$ on $w$ halts and accepts, $M'$ then writes a new special symbol 'x' twice in a row and halts.\n\nD. On input $\\epsilon$, the machine $M'$ writes the string $w$ on its tape.

Crucially, the construction must ensure that $M'$ does not accidentally meet the “twice in a row” writing condition unless $M$ accepts $w$.\n\nAssess each proposal:\n\nA. This $M'$ simulates $M$ on $w$, and if it discovers that $M$ halts and accepts, it writes '1' twice in a row and halts. The forward implication holds: if $M$ accepts $w$ then $M'$ will indeed write the repeated symbol. However, the reverse implication can fail because during the simulation phase $M'$ may itself write the same non-blank symbol twice in a row even if $M$ never accepts. For example, let $M$ be a machine that on any input performs two consecutive write steps of the same non-blank symbol (say it writes '1' on two successive transitions) and then rejects. Then $M$ does not accept $w$, yet $M'$ will produce the “two identical writes in a row” during the simulation. Hence\n$$\n\\langle M,w \\rangle \\notin A_{TM} \\quad \\text{but} \\quad \\langle M' \\rangle \\in L_{REP\\_SYM},\n$$\nviolating the required equivalence. Therefore A is not a correct reduction.\n\nB. This $M'$ examines $\\langle M \\rangle$ and checks for repeated adjacent characters in the encoding; if found, it writes '1' twice and halts, otherwise it halts immediately. This behavior depends only on the syntactic form of $\\langle M \\rangle$ and ignores $w$ and the semantic question of whether $M$ accepts $w$. Therefore there exist $\\langle M,w \\rangle$ and $\\langle N,u \\rangle$ with identical encoding properties (or simple renamings) but different acceptance behavior, so the equivalence\n$$\n\\langle M,w \\rangle \\in A_{TM} \\iff \\langle M' \\rangle \\in L_{REP\\_SYM}\n$$\ncannot be guaranteed. Hence B is not a correct reduction.\n\nC. This $M'$ simulates $M$ on $w$ but, for each tape symbol $\\sigma$ of $M$, uses two distinct symbols $\\sigma_{A}$ and $\\sigma_{B}$ in $M'$’s alphabet, and alternates between them whenever $M$ writes $\\sigma$. This ensures that during the simulation phase $M'$ never writes the same non-blank symbol twice in consecutive write steps: if two consecutive writes in the simulated run are of the same base symbol $\\sigma$, then $M'$ writes $\\sigma_{A}$ followed by $\\sigma_{B}$ (or vice versa), which are distinct; if the base symbols differ, then the written symbols are different anyway. After the simulation, if and only if $M$ halts and accepts $w$, $M'$ writes a new special symbol $x$ twice in a row and halts. Therefore:\n- If $M$ accepts $w$, then $M'$ eventually writes $x$ twice in a row, so $\\langle M' \\rangle \\in L_{REP\\_SYM}$.\n- If $M$ does not accept $w$ (rejects or loops), then $M'$ never enters the post-accept phase and, by construction of the alternating write mechanism, never writes the same non-blank symbol twice in a row during the simulation. Thus $\\langle M' \\rangle \\notin L_{REP\\_SYM}$.\nHence\n$$\n\\langle M,w \\rangle \\in A_{TM} \\iff \\langle M' \\rangle \\in L_{REP\\_SYM},\n$$\nand the mapping is computable. Therefore C is a correct reduction establishing undecidability of $L_{REP\\_SYM}$.\n\nD. This $M'$ first writes $w$ on its tape, then simulates $M$ on $w$ and writes '1' '1' if the simulation halts for any reason. There are two distinct failures: (i) while writing the input $w$, if $w$ contains any adjacent equal symbols, $M'$ will write the same non-blank symbol twice in a row immediately, independent of $M$’s behavior; (ii) even disregarding that, the trigger condition is whether $M$ halts (accepts or rejects), not whether $M$ accepts, so it reduces to the halting problem rather than $A_{TM}$. In either case, the equivalence with acceptance fails, so D is not a correct reduction.\n\nConclusion: exactly proposal C achieves a valid many-one reduction from $A_{TM}$ to $L_{REP\\_SYM}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1468757"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem synthesizes the skills you've developed by asking for a complete classification of a language's computability.

Given an input $\\langle M,w\\rangle$, construct a recognizer $R$ that simulates $M$ on $w$ step by step. After each simulated step, $R$ computes the current tape content string $s$ by locating the leftmost and rightmost non-blank symbols and extracting the contiguous block between them. Then $R$ checks whether $|s|\\geq 1$ and whether $s$ equals its reversal. If both conditions hold, $R$ accepts; otherwise, it continues the simulation.

If the simulated head would move beyond the current boundary, $M'$ shifts the corresponding boundary marker outward by one cell, preserving the invariant that $L$ remains the leftmost non-blank symbol and $R$ remains the rightmost non-blank symbol, with $L\\neq R$. During any such boundary adjustment, $M'$ ensures that the current rightmost non-blank is always $R$ (and the leftmost is always $L$), so the overall non-blank block continues to start with $L$ and end with $R$.\n- If the simulated $M$ ever halts on $w$, $M'$ enters a special phase: it erases the entire non-blank block and writes exactly the two-symbol string $A A$ on the tape, producing a configuration whose contiguous non-blank block is the non-empty palindrome $A A$.\n\nCorrectness of the reduction:\n- If $M$ halts on $w$, then $M'$ eventually enters the special phase and produces a configuration with tape content $A A$, which is a non-empty palindrome. Hence $\\langle M',x\\rangle\\in\\mathrm{PAL\\_CONF}$.\n- If $M$ does not halt on $w$, then $M'$ never exits the simulation phase.
