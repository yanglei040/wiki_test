This hands-on example highlights the fundamental advantage of using the full \"soft\" information available from the channel, rather than discarding it through premature quantization.", "problem": "In a simple digital communication system, a single information bit $b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is encoded for reliability using a three-bit repetition code, denoted as $R_3$. If the information bit is $b=0$, the transmitted codeword is $(0,0,0)$. If the information bit is $b=1$, the transmitted codeword is $(1,1,1)$. For transmission, the bit $0$ is mapped to a signal level of $-1$ arbitrary unit, and the bit $1$ is mapped to a signal level of $+1$ arbitrary unit. The codeword is then sent through a noisy channel.\n\nAt the receiver, a sequence of three real-valued numbers, $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3)$, is observed. These values are proportional to the Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) for each received bit. A positive value $y_i$ indicates that the $i$-th bit is more likely to be a $1$, while a negative value indicates it is more likely to be a $0$. The magnitude $|y_i|$ represents the confidence in this assessment.\n\nSuppose the received sequence is $y = (+0.8, +0.9, -2.1)$.\n\nWe will compare two decoding strategies:\n\n1.  **Hard-Decision Decoding**: This decoder first makes an individual, or \"hard,\" decision for each received value $y_i$. A received value $y_i > 0$ is decoded as the bit $\\hat{b}_i = 1$, and a value $y_i  0$ is decoded as $\\hat{b}_i = 0$. The final decoded bit, $b_{HD}$, is then determined by a majority vote on the sequence of hard-decoded bits $(\\hat{b}_1, \\hat{b}_2, \\hat{b}_3)$.\n\n2.  **Soft-Decision Decoding**: This decoder uses the \"soft\" information, i.e., the actual real values, directly. The decision metric, $L$, is the sum of the received values: $L = y_1 + y_2 + y_3$. The final decoded bit, $b_{SD}$, is determined by the sign of $L$. If $L > 0$, the decoder decides $b_{SD} = 1$. If $L  0$, it decides $b_{SD} = 0$.\n\nDetermine the decoded bits $b_{HD}$ and $b_{SD}$ for the given received sequence. Present your answer as an ordered pair $(b_{HD}, b_{SD})$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to decode a received sequence $y = (+0.8, +0.9, -2.1)$ using two different methods: hard-decision decoding and soft-decision decoding. The original information bit $b$ was encoded using a three-bit repetition code. We need to find the decoded bits $b_{HD}$ and $b_{SD}$ and present them as a pair.\n\nFirst, let's perform hard-decision decoding. This process involves two steps: first, quantizing each received value to a binary bit (0 or 1), and second, performing a majority vote on the resulting sequence of bits.\n\nThe rule for quantization is:\n- If $y_i > 0$, the hard decision for that bit is $\\hat{b}_i = 1$.\n- If $y_i  0$, the hard decision for that bit is $\\hat{b}_i = 0$.\n\nApplying this rule to the received sequence $y = (+0.8, +0.9, -2.1)$:\n- For $y_1 = +0.8$: Since $0.8 > 0$, the hard decision is $\\hat{b}_1 = 1$.\n- For $y_2 = +0.9$: Since $0.9 > 0$, the hard decision is $\\hat{b}_2 = 1$.\n- For $y_3 = -2.1$: Since $-2.1  0$, the hard decision is $\\hat{b}_3 = 0$.\n\nThis gives us the hard-decision bit sequence $(\\hat{b}_1, \\hat{b}_2, \\hat{b}_3) = (1, 1, 0)$.\n\nThe next step is to apply a majority vote to this sequence. The sequence contains two 1s and one 0. The bit that appears most frequently is 1. Therefore, the majority-logic decoder's output is 1.\nSo, the hard-decision decoded bit is $b_{HD} = 1$.\n\nNext, let's perform soft-decision decoding. This method uses the raw received values without prior quantization. The decision is based on the sign of the sum of the received values, which act as a decision metric $L$.\n\nThe decision metric $L$ is calculated as:\n$$L = y_1 + y_2 + y_3$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L = (+0.8) + (+0.9) + (-2.1)$$\n$$L = 1.7 - 2.1$$\n$$L = -0.4$$\n\nThe rule for soft-decision decoding is:\n- If $L > 0$, decide in favor of bit 1.\n- If $L  0$, decide in favor of bit 0.\n\nIn our case, $L = -0.4$, which is less than 0. According to the rule, the decoder decides in favor of bit 0.\nSo, the soft-decision decoded bit is $b_{SD} = 0$.\n\nThis result highlights a key difference between the two methods. The hard-decision decoder sees two votes for \"1\" and one for \"0\", and decides \"1\". The soft-decision decoder, however, weighs the evidence. It sees two weak votes for \"1\" (from $+0.8$ and $+0.9$) and one very strong vote for \"0\" (from $-2.1$). The single strong evidence for \"0\" outweighs the two weak pieces of evidence for \"1\", causing the final decision to be \"0\".\n\nFinally, we are asked to present the answer as the ordered pair $(b_{HD}, b_{SD})$.\nFrom our calculations, we have $b_{HD} = 1$ and $b_{SD} = 0$.\n\nThus, the final answer is the pair $(1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1629075"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the value of soft information, we now formalize this concept using the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR), a crucial metric in modern digital communications.

The average energy per transmitted symbol is normalized to $E_s=1$.\n\nThe four constellation points are defined by a Gray-coded mapping of a pair of bits, $(b_1, b_2)$. The first bit, $b_1$, determines the in-phase (real) component of the symbol, and the second bit, $b_2$, determines the quadrature (imaginary) component. The specific mapping from bits to symbol components is as follows:\n- $b_1=0 \\implies$ In-phase component is $-A$\n- $b_1=1 \\implies$ In-phase component is $+A$\n- $b_2=0 \\implies$ Quadrature component is $+A$\n- $b_2=1 \\implies$ Quadrature component is $-A$\n\nHere, the positive real constant $A$ is chosen such that the average symbol energy equals $E_s=1$.

Given that $E_s=1$, we have $2A^2 = 1$, which gives $A = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of a bit value is $P(b_1=i|y) = \\frac{p(y|b_1=i)P(b_1=i)}{p(y)}$. Since the four symbols are equiprobable, the bits $b_1=0$ and $b_1=1$ are also equiprobable, so $P(b_1=0) = P(b_1=1) = 1/2$. The LLR expression simplifies to:\n$$L(b_1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(y|b_1=0)P(b_1=0)/p(y)}{p(y|b_1=1)P(b_1=1)/p(y)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(y|b_1=0)}{p(y|b_1=1)}\\right)$$\n\nThe probability density $p(y|b_1=i)$ is the marginal probability, which can be found by summing over all possible symbols corresponding to $b_1=i$. The event $b_1=0$ corresponds to transmitting a symbol with an in-phase component of $-A$. The two such symbols are $s_{00} = -A+jA$ and $s_{01} = -A-jA$. The event $b_1=1$ corresponds to an in-phase component of $+A$, with symbols $s_{10} = A+jA$ and $s_{11} = A-jA$.\nSince the two possibilities for $b_2$ are equally likely for a given $b_1$, we can write:\n$$p(y|b_1=0) = \\frac{1}{2} p(y|s=s_{00}) + \\frac{1}{2} p(y|s=s_{01})$$\n$$p(y|b_1=1) = \\frac{1}{2} p(y|s=s_{10}) + \\frac{1}{2} p(y|s=s_{11})$$\nThe conditional PDF for receiving $y$ given a transmitted symbol $s$ over an AWGN channel is $p(y|s) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y-s|^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the LLR expression:\n$$L(b_1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y-s_{00}|^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y-s_{01}|^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right]}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y-s_{10}|^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y-s_{11}|^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right]}\\right)$$\nThe constant factors cancel.
