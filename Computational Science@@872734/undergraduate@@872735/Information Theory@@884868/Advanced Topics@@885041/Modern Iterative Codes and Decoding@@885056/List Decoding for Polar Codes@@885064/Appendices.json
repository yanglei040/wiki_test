By analyzing how the workload scales with block length $N$ and list size $L$, you will gain a fundamental understanding of the trade-off between the enhanced error-correction performance of SCL and its increased computational cost compared to standard Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding [@problem_id:1637429].", "problem": "An engineer is designing a communication system using polar codes, a class of error-correcting codes with a block length $N$ that is a power of two, i.e., $N=2^n$ for some integer $n$. The standard decoding algorithm, known as Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding, estimates the $N$ transmitted bits one by one. The total computational complexity required for the SC decoder to process the entire block is on the order of $O(N \\log N)$.\n\nTo enhance the system's reliability, the engineer considers using Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding. This algorithm improves upon SC by maintaining a list of $L$ different candidate decoding paths simultaneously. For each of the $N$ bits to be decoded in sequence, the SCL decoder performs the following operation: for each of the (at most) $L$ paths currently on the list, it extends the path by considering both possibilities for the current bit (a '0' and a '1'). This temporarily creates up to $2L$ paths. It then calculates a quality metric for each of these new paths and prunes the list back down to size $L$ by keeping only the $L$ paths with the best metrics. This process is repeated for all $N$ bits.\n\nThe core computational work in SC decoding for a single bit decision is proportional to $\\log N$. In SCL, this core work must be performed for each of the $L$ candidate paths. The additional step of managing, sorting, and pruning the list from $2L$ candidates down to $L$ at each of the $N$ stages is found to have a complexity that is also proportional to $L$.\n\nGiven this description, which of the following expressions best characterizes the total computational complexity of SCL decoding with a list size $L$ and block length $N$?\n\nA. $O(LN)$\n\nB. $O(N \\log N)$\n\nC. $O(N + L \\log N)$\n\nD. $O(L N \\log N)$\n\nE. $O(L^2 N \\log N)$", "solution": "The problem asks for the total computational complexity of Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding for a polar code of block length $N$ and list size $L$. We can determine this by analyzing the work done at each stage of the decoding process and summing it over all stages.\n\nThe decoding process consists of $N$ sequential stages, one for each bit to be estimated. Let's analyze the complexity of a single stage, say stage $i$ where $1 \\le i \\le N$.\n\nAccording to the problem description, at each stage, the SCL decoder operates on a list of up to $L$ candidate paths. The work performed at a single stage can be broken down into two main parts:\n1.  **Path Extension and Likelihood Calculation:** The standard Successive Cancellation (SC) decoder requires work proportional to $\\log N$ for a single bit decision. In SCL decoding, this core computation must be performed for each of the $L$ paths currently in the list. Therefore, the complexity of extending all $L$ paths and calculating their new likelihoods is $L \\times O(\\log N) = O(L \\log N)$.\n\n2.  **Path Management (Pruning):** After extending the $L$ paths into $2L$ potential new paths, the decoder must sort and prune this list back down to size $L$. The problem statement specifies that the complexity of this management step is proportional to $L$, which can be written as $O(L)$.\n\nThe total complexity for a single stage is the sum of the complexities of these two parts.\nComplexity per stage = (Complexity of likelihood calculation) + (Complexity of path management)\nComplexity per stage = $O(L \\log N) + O(L)$.\n\nFor any polar code with block length $N > 2$, we have $\\log N > 1$. Therefore, the term $O(L \\log N)$ is asymptotically dominant over the $O(L)$ term. So, we can simplify the complexity for a single stage to:\nComplexity per stage = $O(L \\log N)$.\n\nThis work is performed for each of the $N$ bits that need to be decoded. Since the stages are sequential, we find the total complexity by multiplying the complexity per stage by the number of stages, $N$.\n\nTotal Complexity = Number of stages $\\times$ Complexity per stage\nTotal Complexity = $N \\times O(L \\log N)$\nTotal Complexity = $O(L N \\log N)$.\n\nNow we compare this result with the given options:\nA. $O(LN)$: This ignores the $\\log N$ factor inherent in the structure of polar code decoding.\nB. $O(N \\log N)$: This is the complexity of standard SC decoding ($L=1$) and ignores the factor of $L$ for list decoding.\nC. $O(N + L \\log N)$: This incorrectly adds the complexities instead of multiplying them.\nD. $O(L N \\log N)$: This matches our derived complexity.\nE. $O(L^2 N \\log N)$: This would imply that the path management is quadratic in $L$, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nThus, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1637429"}, {"introduction": "In practice, SCL decoding is almost always enhanced with a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) to form CRC-Aided SCL decoding. The CRC acts as a powerful tool to verify the integrity of the candidate paths and select the correct one. This practice problem focuses on a critical scenario in this process: what happens when none of the decoder's best hypotheses satisfy the CRC check? Understanding this outcome is key to appreciating the role of the CRC as a decisive component of the decoding algorithm [@problem_id:1637445].", "problem": "In modern communication systems, polar codes are often paired with a powerful decoding algorithm known as CRC-Aided Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding.

This outcome is distinct from higher-layer actions (e.g., retransmission requests), which are handled by protocols outside the decoder, and it is also distinct from ad hoc fallbacks (e.g., outputting the best-metric candidate without CRC), which are not the formal CRC-aided rule.\n\nTherefore, when all $L$ paths fail the CRC, the formal result is a decoding failure for the block, corresponding to option B, while options A, C, D, and E contradict the standard CRC-aided decision rule or belong to other system layers/strategies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1637445"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond fixed-list decoders, this advanced problem provides a hands-on simulation of a sophisticated adaptive SCL decoder.
