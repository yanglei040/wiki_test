By calculating the capacities of these new synthetic channels for a Binary Erasure Channel, you will grasp the principle that enables us to separate \"good\" channels for carrying information from \"bad\" channels that we freeze [@problem_id:1661168].", "problem": "Channel polarization is a foundational technique in modern coding theory, used to construct channels that are either nearly perfect or nearly useless from multiple instances of a given, non-extreme channel. This allows for the design of highly efficient error-correcting codes, such as polar codes.\n\nConsider a memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC), denoted by $W$. This channel has an input alphabet $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}$ and an output alphabet $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0, 1, e\\}$, where 'e' represents an erasure. For any input bit $x \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, the channel correctly transmits the bit (i.e., the output is $y=x$) with probability $1-\\epsilon$, and it erases the bit (i.e., the output is $y=e$) with probability $\\epsilon$. The capacity of this channel is $I(W) = 1-\\epsilon$.\n\nWe apply a single step of the Arıkan polar transform to two independent uses of this channel $W$. Two information bits, $u_1$ and $u_2$, are drawn from $\\{0, 1\\}$. They are encoded into two channel inputs, $x_1$ and $x_2$, using the transformation $x_1 = u_1 \\oplus u_2$ and $x_2 = u_2$, where $\\oplus$ denotes addition modulo 2. These are then transmitted over the two channel instances, yielding outputs $y_1$ and $y_2$.\n\nThis process creates two new synthetic channels, $W^-$ and $W^+$, which are decoded successively.\n1. The channel $W^-$ is used to transmit $u_1$. Its input is $u_1$ and its effective output is the pair $(y_1, y_2)$. The decoding of $u_1$ is performed assuming no knowledge of the value of $u_2$.\n2. The channel $W^+$ is used to transmit $u_2$. Its input is $u_2$ and its effective output is the pair $(y_1, y_2)$. Crucially, the decoder for $u_2$ is assumed to have perfect knowledge of $u_1$, as if it has already been successfully decoded in the first step.\n\nAssuming the information bits $u_1$ and $u_2$ are chosen independently and uniformly at random, determine the Shannon capacities of the synthetic channels, $I(W^-)$ and $I(W^+)$. Your final answer should be a pair of analytic expressions in terms of the erasure probability $\\epsilon$.", "solution": "Let $W$ be a binary erasure channel with input $X \\in \\{0,1\\}$, output $Y \\in \\{0,1,e\\}$, and erasure probability $\\epsilon$, so $W(y|x)$ equals $1-\\epsilon$ if $y=x$, equals $\\epsilon$ if $y=e$, and equals $0$ otherwise. Two independent uses of $W$ are applied to inputs $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, producing outputs $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$, with independence given by the memoryless property:\n$$\nP_{Y_{1},Y_{2}|X_{1},X_{2}}(y_{1},y_{2}|x_{1},x_{2})=W(y_{1}|x_{1})\\,W(y_{2}|x_{2}).\n$$\nThe Arıkan transform maps independent uniform bits $U_{1},U_{2}$ to $X_{1}=U_{1}\\oplus U_{2}$ and $X_{2}=U_{2}$.\n\nBy definition of the synthetic channels,\n$$\nI(W^{-})=I(U_{1};Y_{1},Y_{2}),\\qquad I(W^{+})=I(U_{2};Y_{1},Y_{2},U_{1}),\n$$\nwith $U_{1},U_{2}$ independent and uniformly distributed. For the BEC, it is convenient to characterize these synthetic channels via their effective erasure events and then use that a BEC with erasure probability $\\delta$ has capacity $1-\\delta$ under uniform input.\n\nFirst, consider $W^{-}$, which conveys $U_{1}$ through the effective output $(Y_{1},Y_{2})$ without knowledge of $U_{2}$ at the decoder. The decoder can determine $U_{1}$ if and only if both $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are known from the outputs, because\n$$\nU_{1}=X_{1}\\oplus X_{2}.\n$$\nThe symbol $X_{i}$ is known exactly if and only if $Y_{i}\\in\\{0,1\\}$ (i.e., not erased). Therefore, $U_{1}$ is recoverable if and only if the event $\\{Y_{1}\\neq e\\}\\cap\\{Y_{2}\\neq e\\}$ occurs. Since each use of the channel erases independently with probability $\\epsilon$,\n$$\nP(Y_{1}\\neq e,\\,Y_{2}\\neq e)=(1-\\epsilon)^{2}.\n$$\nHence the effective erasure probability of $W^{-}$ is\n$$\n\\epsilon^{-}=1-(1-\\epsilon)^{2}=2\\epsilon-\\epsilon^{2},\n$$\nso its capacity is\n$$\nI(W^{-})=1-\\epsilon^{-}=1-(2\\epsilon-\\epsilon^{2})=(1-\\epsilon)^{2}.\n$$\n\nNext, consider $W^{+}$, which conveys $U_{2}$ through $(Y_{1},Y_{2})$ with $U_{1}$ known at the decoder.

We will solve this by following the encoding and decoding steps precisely.\n\nFirst, we determine the transmitted codeword. The source bits are given by the frozen bit $u_1 = 0$ and the information bit $u_2 = 1$, so $\\mathbf{u} = (0, 1)$. The encoding is given by $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{u} G_2$:\n$$ \\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2) = (u_1, u_2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = (u_1 \\oplus u_2, u_2) $$\nwhere $\\oplus$ denotes addition modulo 2.

The decoder first estimates $u_1$. Since $u_1$ is a frozen bit with a known value of 0, the decoder sets its estimate $\\hat{u}_1 = 0$. There is no uncertainty or chance of error in this step.\n\nThen, the decoder estimates $u_2$ using the received vector $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2)$ and its knowledge that $u_1=0$ (or more formally, its estimate $\\hat{u}_1=0$). The decoder makes a maximum-likelihood decision. It compares the probability of receiving $\\mathbf{y}$ if $u_2=0$ versus if $u_2=1$, given that $u_1=0$.\nThe decoder decides $\\hat{u}_2=0$ if $P(y_1, y_2|u_1=0, u_2=0) \\ge P(y_1, y_2|u_1=0, u_2=1)$.\nThe decoder decides $\\hat{u}_2=1$ if $P(y_1, y_2|u_1=0, u_2=0)  P(y_1, y_2|u_1=0, u_2=1)$.\n\nSince the channel is memoryless, the joint probability is the product of individual probabilities:\n$$ P(y_1, y_2|u_1, u_2) = P(y_1|x_1) P(y_2|x_2) = P(y_1|u_1 \\oplus u_2) P(y_2|u_2) $$\nLet's evaluate the two probabilities for the decoder's comparison, given $u_1=0$:\nIf $u_2=0$: $x_1=0\\oplus0=0, x_2=0$.
