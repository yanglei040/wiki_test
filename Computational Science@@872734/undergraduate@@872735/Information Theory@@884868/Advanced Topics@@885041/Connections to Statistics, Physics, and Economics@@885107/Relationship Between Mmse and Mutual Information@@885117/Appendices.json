For an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, the slope of the mutual information curve with respect to SNR near zero is determined by a fundamental quantity: the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) evaluated at zero SNR.\n\nConsider a communication system that transmits a signal $X$. The signal is a random variable that takes values from the set $\\{-A, 0, A\\}$, where $A=5.0$. The probability distribution for $X$ is given by $P(X = A) = 0.25$, $P(X = -A) = 0.25$, and $P(X=0)=0.5$.\n\nThe signal is transmitted over an AWGN channel, and the received signal is $Y = X + Z$. Here, $Z$ is a zero-mean Gaussian noise variable with variance $\\sigma^2$, independent of $X$. The SNR is defined as the ratio of the average signal power to the noise power, $\\text{SNR} = \\frac{E[X^2]}{\\sigma^2}$.\n\nThe MMSE is the minimum possible average squared error of any estimator of $X$ based on the observation $Y$, and is given by $\\text{mmse} = E[(X - E[X|Y])^2]$.\n\nCalculate the value of the MMSE in the limit as the SNR approaches zero.", "solution": "The problem requires us to compute the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) in the limit of zero Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The MMSE in estimating a random variable $X$ from an observation $Y$ is given by the expression $\\text{mmse} = E[(X - \\hat{X})^2]$, where the optimal estimator is the conditional mean, $\\hat{X} = E[X|Y]$.\n\nThe SNR is defined as $\\text{SNR} = \\frac{E[X^2]}{\\sigma^2}$, where $E[X^2]$ is the average power of the signal $X$ and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance (power) of the noise $Z$.\n\nFirst, we compute the average power of the signal $X$. The signal $X$ can take values from $\\{-5.0, 0, 5.0\\}$ with probabilities $P(X=-5.0) = 0.25$, $P(X=0) = 0.5$, and $P(X=5.0) = 0.25$.\nThe average signal power, $E[X^2]$, is calculated as:\n$$ E[X^2] = \\sum_{x} x^2 P(X=x) $$\n$$ E[X^2] = (-5.0)^2 P(X=-5.0) + (0)^2 P(X=0) + (5.0)^2 P(X=5.0) $$\n$$ E[X^2] = (25.0)(0.25) + (0)(0.5) + (25.0)(0.25) = 6.25 + 0 + 6.25 = 12.5 $$\nThe average signal power $E[X^2]$ is a finite, positive constant.\n\nThe problem asks for the MMSE in the limit as $\\text{SNR} \\to 0$. We examine the implication of this limit on the noise power $\\sigma^2$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\text{SNR} \\to 0} \\frac{E[X^2]}{\\sigma^2} = \\lim_{\\text{SNR} \\to 0} \\frac{12.5}{\\sigma^2} = 0 $$\nFor this limit to hold, the denominator must approach infinity, so $\\sigma^2 \\to \\infty$. A zero-SNR condition corresponds to infinite noise power.\n\nThe received signal is $Y = X + Z$. In the limit of infinite noise power ($\\sigma^2 \\to \\infty$), the noise term $Z$ completely overwhelms the finite signal term $X$. Consequently, the observed signal $Y$ contains no information about the transmitted signal $X$. In this limit, $X$ and $Y$ become statistically independent.\n\nThe MMSE estimator is the conditional expectation $\\hat{X} = E[X|Y]$. When the observation $Y$ is independent of the signal $X$, the conditional expectation provides no more information than the unconditional expectation. Therefore, the estimator becomes:\n$$ \\lim_{\\sigma^2 \\to \\infty} E[X|Y] = E[X] $$\n\nWe now calculate the unconditional mean of the signal, $E[X]$:\n$$ E[X] = \\sum_{x} x P(X=x) $$\n$$ E[X] = (-5.0) P(X=-5.0) + (0) P(X=0) + (5.0) P(X=5.0) $$\n$$ E[X] = (-5.0)(0.25) + (0)(0.5) + (5.0)(0.25) = -1.25 + 0 + 1.25 = 0 $$\nThus, in the zero-SNR limit, the best estimate of $X$ is its mean value, which is $0$, irrespective of the value of $Y$.\n\nNow, we can find the MMSE in this limit by substituting the limiting estimator into the definition of MMSE:\n$$ \\text{mmse}(\\text{SNR}=0) = \\lim_{\\text{SNR} \\to 0} E[(X - E[X|Y])^2] $$\nBy moving the limit inside the expectation (which is permissible here), we get:\n$$ \\text{mmse}(\\text{SNR}=0) = E\\left[\\left(X - \\lim_{\\text{SNR} \\to 0} E[X|Y]\\right)^2\\right] = E[(X - E[X])^2] $$\nThis final expression is the definition of the variance of $X$, denoted as $\\text{Var}(X)$.\n\nThe variance is calculated using the formula $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. Using the values we have already computed:\n$$ E[X^2] = 12.5 $$\n$$ E[X] = 0 $$\nThe variance is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(X) = 12.5 - (0)^2 = 12.5 $$\n\nTherefore, the MMSE in the limit as the SNR approaches zero is equal to the variance of the signal $X$, which is 12.5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12.5}$$", "id": "1654355"}, {"introduction": "The I-MMSE relationship provides a powerful bridge between estimation error and information-theoretic measures.
