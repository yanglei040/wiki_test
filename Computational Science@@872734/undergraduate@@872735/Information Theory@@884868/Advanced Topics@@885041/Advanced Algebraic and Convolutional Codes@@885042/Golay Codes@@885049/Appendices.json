It is a $(23, 12)$ linear block code, which means it encodes a 12-bit message into a 23-bit codeword.\n\nThe encoding process can be described by matrix multiplication using a generator matrix $G$. A standard generator matrix for $G_{23}$ is given in systematic form as $G = [I_{12} | A]$, where all arithmetic is performed in the finite field GF(2) (i.e., addition is XOR, and multiplication is AND).\n- $I_{12}$ is the $12 \\times 12$ identity matrix.\n- $A$ is a $12 \\times 11$ matrix that generates the parity bits. Its structure is as follows (using 0-based indexing for rows and columns):\n    - The first row, $A_{0}$, is an all-ones vector: $A_{0} = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$.\n    - The subsequent 11 rows, from $A_{1}$ to $A_{11}$, form an $11 \\times 11$ circulant matrix. A circulant matrix is one where each row is a cyclic shift of the row above it. The first row of this circulant submatrix, which corresponds to row $A_1$, is the vector $s = (0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)$. Thus, $A_2$ is a right cyclic shift of $A_1$, $A_3$ is a right cyclic shift of $A_2$, and so on.\n\nYou are given the 12-bit message vector $m = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\nCalculate the corresponding 23-bit codeword $c$ by computing the matrix-vector product $c = mG$.
