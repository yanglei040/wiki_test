This first practice explores the core design equations for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. You will apply the essential relationships between the size of the underlying finite field ($q$), the total codeword length ($n$), the message length ($k$), and the minimum distance ($d$), which quantifies the code's error-detecting capability. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward building and understanding RS codes for any application [@problem_id:1653324].", "problem": "In digital communications, Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are a powerful class of error-correcting codes. These codes are constructed over a finite field, known as a Galois Field and denoted as $GF(q)$, which contains $q$ elements. A specific RS code is defined by its block length $n$ (the total number of symbols in an encoded block) and its message length $k$ (the number of original data symbols).\n\nA standard RS code built over the field $GF(q)$ has a maximum possible block length of $n = q - 1$. The error-correction capability of an RS code is determined by its minimum distance, $d$, which is related to $n$ and $k$ by the equation $d = n - k + 1$.\n\nConsider the design of a communication system using an RS code over the field $GF(128)$. To meet the system's reliability requirements, the code must be designed to have a minimum distance of at least $d=17$. What is the maximum possible message length $k$ for this code?", "solution": "An RS code over $GF(q)$ has a maximum block length $n=q-1$ and, being maximum-distance separable, satisfies the Singleton bound with equality:\n$$\nd = n - k + 1.\n$$\nHere, $q=128$, so the maximum allowable block length is\n$$\nn = q - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127.\n$$\nThe design requires a minimum distance at least $d=17$. To maximize the message length $k$ under this constraint, choose the smallest admissible distance $d=17$, and solve for $k$:\n$$\nk = n - d + 1 = 127 - 17 + 1 = 111.\n$$\nThus, the maximum possible message length is $k=111$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{111}$$", "id": "1653324"}, {"introduction": "A code's minimum distance is a powerful theoretical concept, but its practical value lies in its ability to correct errors. This exercise bridges that gap by connecting the minimum distance, $d$, to the number of symbol errors, $t$, that a decoder can guaranteed correct. By working through this problem, you will learn how to translate the structural properties of an RS code into a concrete performance metric, a critical skill for evaluating the reliability of a communication system [@problem_id:1653334].", "problem": "A deep-space probe, named \"Stellartrek-1,\" is tasked with exploring the outer reaches of the solar system and transmitting valuable scientific data back to Earth. Due to the vast distances and interference from cosmic radiation, the communication channel is inherently noisy, causing potential corruption of the transmitted data packets. To combat this, the probe's communication system employs a Reed-Solomon (RS) error-correcting code.\n\nThe system processes data in blocks. Each original data message, consisting of $k$ symbols, is passed through an RS encoder. The encoder appends a set of parity symbols, resulting in a longer transmitted codeword of length $n$ symbols. For the Stellartrek-1 mission, the code is configured with a codeword length of $n = 31$ symbols and an original message length of $k = 21$ symbols. An error is defined as a single symbol in the codeword being altered during transmission.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of symbol errors that can occur within a single transmitted codeword that the receiving station on Earth is guaranteed to be able to identify and correct?", "solution": "For a Reed-Solomon code over a finite field with parameters $(n,k)$, the minimum Hamming distance is given by the MDS property:\n$$\nd_{\\min}=n-k+1.\n$$\nA bounded-distance decoder is guaranteed to uniquely identify and correct any error pattern with up to\n$$\nt=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{d_{\\min}-1}{2}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n-k}{2}\\right\\rfloor\n$$\nsymbol errors.\n\nFor the given code with $n=31$ and $k=21$, we compute\n$$\nd_{\\min}=31-21+1=11,\n$$\nand therefore\n$$\nt=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{11-1}{2}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{10}{2}\\right\\rfloor=5.\n$$\nThus, the receiver is guaranteed to identify and correct up to $5$ symbol errors per codeword.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "1653334"}, {"introduction": "To truly appreciate the power of Reed-Solomon codes, it's helpful to see how they stack up against other well-known coding schemes. This practice provides a direct comparison between an RS code and a classic binary Hamming code with similar parameters. By calculating and comparing their respective minimum distances, you will discover one of the key reasons RS codes are so widely used: they are \"Maximum Distance Separable\" (MDS), meaning they achieve the best possible error-correction capability for a given codeword and message length [@problem_id:1653302].", "problem": "In the design of a fault-tolerant memory system, two different error-correcting codes are proposed to protect data.\n\nThe first proposal is to use a standard binary Hamming code. This code is defined by a codeword length of $n_H = 15$ bits. For a binary Hamming code with $r$ parity-check bits, the relationship between codeword length and parity bits is $n_H = 2^r - 1$. The number of information bits it can encode is $k_H = n_H - r$.\n\nThe second proposal is to use a Reed-Solomon (RS) code. This code operates on symbols from the Galois Field GF(16).
