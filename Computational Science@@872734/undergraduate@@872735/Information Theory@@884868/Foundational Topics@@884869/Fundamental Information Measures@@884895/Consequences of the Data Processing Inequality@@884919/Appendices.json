The calculation is to be done in bits, so we use the logarithm to base 2.\n\nWe are given the probability distribution for the process state $X$:\n$P(X=1) = \\frac{1}{5}$\n$P(X=0) = 1 - P(X=1) = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nWe are also given the probability distribution for the pressure level $Y$:\n$P(Y=1) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$P(Y=2) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$P(Y=3) = \\frac{1}{8}$\n$P(Y=4) = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nThe summary statistic $Z$ is a deterministic function of $Y$, given by $Z = g(Y) = (Y^2 - 1) \\pmod 3$. First, we must determine the possible values of $Z$ and its probability distribution, $p(z)$.\n- For $Y=1$: $Z = (1^2 - 1) \\pmod 3 = 0 \\pmod 3 = 0$.\n- For $Y=2$: $Z = (2^2 - 1) \\pmod 3 = 3 \\pmod 3 = 0$.\n- For $Y=3$: $Z = (3^2 - 1) \\pmod 3 = 8 \\pmod 3 = 2$.\n- For $Y=4$: $Z = (4^2 - 1) \\pmod 3 = 15 \\pmod 3 = 0$.\nThe set of possible values for $Z$ is $\\mathcal{Z} = \\{0, 2\\}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the marginal probability distribution $p(z)$:\n$P(Z=0) = P(Y=1) + P(Y=2) + P(Y=4) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n$P(Z=2) = P(Y=3) = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nAs a check, $P(Z=0) + P(Z=2) = \\frac{7}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to find the joint probability distribution $p(x, z)$. For any pair of values $(x, z)$:\n$p(x, z) = P(X=x, Z=z) = P(X=x, g(Y)=z)$.\nWe can write this as a sum over the values of $y$ that map to $z$:\n$P(X=x, g(Y)=z) = \\sum_{y: g(y)=z} P(X=x, Y=y)$.\n\nThe problem states that the process state $X$ and the pressure level $Y$ are independent. Therefore, their joint probability is the product of their marginal probabilities: $P(X=x, Y=y) = P(X=x) P(Y=y)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p(x, z)$:\n$p(x, z) = \\sum_{y: g(y)=z} \\left( P(X=x) P(Y=y) \\right)$.\nSince $P(X=x)$ does not depend on $y$, we can factor it out of the sum:\n$p(x, z) = P(X=x) \\left( \\sum_{y: g(y)=z} P(Y=y) \\right)$.\nThe sum in the parenthesis is precisely the definition of $P(g(Y)=z)$, which is $P(Z=z)$.\nTherefore, we have shown that $p(x, z) = P(X=x) P(Z=z) = p(x) p(z)$.\n\nThis result means that the random variables $X$ and $Z$ are independent.\n\nNow we can calculate the mutual information $I(X; Z)$.

The Data Processing Inequality states that for any such Markov chain, $I(X; Z) \\le I(X; Y)$.\nWe are given that $X$ and $Y$ are independent. The mutual information between two independent variables is zero, so $I(X; Y) = 0$.\nCombining these facts, we have $I(X; Z) \\le 0$. Since mutual information is always non-negative ($I(X;Z) \\ge 0$), the only possible value is $I(X; Z) = 0$.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same result.
