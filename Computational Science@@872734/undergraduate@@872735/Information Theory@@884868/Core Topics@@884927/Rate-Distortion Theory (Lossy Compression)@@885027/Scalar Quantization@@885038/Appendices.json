A key component is a uniform scalar quantizer, and its performance is evaluated using the Signal-to-Quantization-Noise-Ratio (SQNR).\n\nThe engineer initially designs an $N$-level uniform quantizer, which we will call Quantizer A, under the assumption that the input signal voltage is a random variable $X$ uniformly distributed over the range $[-V_{max}, V_{max}]$. However, after building the system, they test it with a very quiet audio passage. Measurements reveal that for this specific passage, the signal voltage is more accurately modeled as a random variable $Y$ that is uniformly distributed over the much smaller range of $[-V_{max}/10, V_{max}/10]$.\n\nA colleague suggests that for this quiet passage, a significantly better SQNR could be obtained by using a different $N$-level uniform quantizer, Quantizer B, that is specifically designed for the actual signal range of $[-V_{max}/10, V_{max}/10]$.\n\nYou are to compare the performance of these two quantizers on the quiet audio signal. For your analysis, use the following standard definitions and approximations from information theory:\n- A random variable uniformly distributed over an interval $[-L, L]$ has a Probability Density Function (PDF) given by $f(x) = 1/(2L)$ for $x \\in [-L, L]$, and $f(x)=0$ otherwise.\n- The signal power, $P_S$, of a zero-mean signal is its mean-squared value.\n- An $N$-level uniform quantizer designed for the range $[-L, L]$ has a quantizing step size of $\\Delta = 2L/N$.\n- The power of the quantization noise, $P_Q$, can be approximated as $P_Q \\approx \\Delta^2/12$, assuming that the number of levels $N$ is sufficiently large and the quantizer is not overloaded (i.e., the input signal is within the design range).\n- The Signal-to-Quantization-Noise-Ratio is defined as the linear ratio $SQNR = P_S / P_Q$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the SQNR achieved by the proposed, correctly-matched Quantizer B ($SQNR_B$) to the SQNR achieved by the original, mismatched Quantizer A ($SQNR_A$), when both are used to process the quiet signal.
