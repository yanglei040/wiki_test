In a BSC, each transmitted bit is flipped (from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) with a fixed crossover probability $p$. For this particular channel, the crossover probability is $p = 0.1$.\n\nThe engineer devises a block code with a block length of $n=8$.

The converse to the channel coding theorem is an asymptotic result. It states that for any sequence of codes with a rate $R > C$, the probability of error must approach 1 as the block length $n$ approaches infinity. It does not forbid the existence of a specific code with a finite block length $n$ and a small, non-zero error probability.\n\nB. The converse theorem is violated. Any code with a rate greater than the channel capacity must have a probability of error equal to 1, regardless of the block length. The engineer's reported error probability of $0.05$ must be the result of a measurement error.\n\nC. The engineer has miscalculated the capacity. For a BSC with $p=0.1$, the capacity is actually greater than the code's rate, which is why a low probability of error is achievable.\n\nD. This result is only possible because the engineer used a highly optimized non-linear code. Shannon's converse theorem only provides a bound for the average performance of randomly constructed linear codes, not for all possible codes.\n\nE.
