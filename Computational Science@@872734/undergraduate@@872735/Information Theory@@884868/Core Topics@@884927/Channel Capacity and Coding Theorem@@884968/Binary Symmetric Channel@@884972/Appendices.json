The sensor transmits a binary signal to a base station: a `0` if there is no rain, and a `1` if there is rain. Historical data indicates that the probability of no rain, and thus the transmission of a `0`, is $0.8$. The communication channel between the sensor and the base station is modeled as a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC), which is a classic model for a noisy channel.
