The system can be modeled as a discrete memoryless channel. The input to the channel is a single bit, represented by a random variable $X$ with the alphabet $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}$. The output of the channel is represented by a random variable $Y$. Due to imperfections, the channel sometimes fails to resolve the transmitted bit, outputting a special \"erasure\" symbol, $\\lambda$. Thus, the output alphabet is $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0, 1, \\lambda\\}$.\n\nThe behavior of the channel is characterized by the following properties:\n1.  The channel never flips a bit. This means that if the output is $0$, the input must have been $0$, and if the output is $1$, the input must have been $1$.\n2.  The probability of an erasure occurring is $\\alpha$, where $0 < \\alpha < 1$. This probability is independent of whether a $0$ or a $1$ was sent.\n\nThe source transmitting the data produces bits with the following probabilities: $P(X=0) = p$ and $P(X=1) = 1-p$, where $0 < p < 1$.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ between the input $X$ and the output $Y$ for this channel.

All logarithms are base 2.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the entropy of the input source, $H(X)$.\nThe random variable $X$ follows a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$. Its entropy is given by the binary entropy function:\n$$H(X) = -\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} P(X=x) \\log_{2}(P(X=x))$$\n$$H(X) = -[P(X=0) \\log_{2}(P(X=0)) + P(X=1) \\log_{2}(P(X=1))]$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities $P(X=0) = p$ and $P(X=1) = 1-p$:\n$$H(X) = -[p \\log_{2}(p) + (1-p) \\log_{2}(1-p)]$$\n\nNext, we calculate the conditional entropy $H(X|Y)$. The formula is:\n$$H(X|Y) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} P(Y=y) H(X|Y=y)$$\nwhere $H(X|Y=y) = -\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} P(X=x|Y=y) \\log_{2}(P(X=x|Y=y))$.\n\nTo do this, we need to determine the channel's transition probabilities $P(Y=y|X=x)$, the output probabilities $P(Y=y)$, and the posterior probabilities $P(X=x|Y=y)$.\n\nThe transition probabilities are given by the problem description:\n-   $P(Y=0|X=0) = 1-\\alpha$ (successful transmission of 0)\n-   $P(Y=\\lambda|X=0) = \\alpha$ (erasure of 0)\n-   $P(Y=1|X=0) = 0$ (no bit flips)\n-   $P(Y=1|X=1) = 1-\\alpha$ (successful transmission of 1)\n-   $P(Y=\\lambda|X=1) = \\alpha$ (erasure of 1)\n-   $P(Y=0|X=1) = 0$ (no bit flips)\n\nNow, we find the output probabilities $P(Y=y)$ using the law of total probability, $P(Y=y) = \\sum_{x} P(Y=y|X=x)P(X=x)$:\n-   $P(Y=0) = P(Y=0|X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=0|X=1)P(X=1) = (1-\\alpha)p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p(1-\\alpha)$\n-   $P(Y=1) = P(Y=1|X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=1|X=1)P(X=1) = 0 \\cdot p + (1-\\alpha)(1-p) = (1-p)(1-\\alpha)$\n-   $P(Y=\\lambda) = P(Y=\\lambda|X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=\\lambda|X=1)P(X=1) = \\alpha p + \\alpha(1-p) = \\alpha(p+1-p) = \\alpha$\n\nNext, we determine the posterior probabilities $P(X=x|Y=y)$ using Bayes' theorem, $P(X=x|Y=y) = \\frac{P(Y=y|X=x)P(X=x)}{P(Y=y)}$:\n-   If $Y=0$:\n    $P(X=0|Y=0) = \\frac{P(Y=0|X=0)P(X=0)}{P(Y=0)} = \\frac{(1-\\alpha)p}{p(1-\\alpha)} = 1$.\n    $P(X=1|Y=0) = 0$.\n    The uncertainty about X is zero when Y=0 is received. Thus, $H(X|Y=0) = 0$.\n-   If $Y=1$:\n    $P(X=1|Y=1) = \\frac{P(Y=1|X=1)P(X=1)}{P(Y=1)} = \\frac{(1-\\alpha)(1-p)}{(1-p)(1-\\alpha)} = 1$.\n    $P(X=0|Y=1) = 0$.\n    The uncertainty about X is zero when Y=1 is received. Thus, $H(X|Y=1) = 0$.\n-   If $Y=\\lambda$:\n    $P(X=0|Y=\\lambda) = \\frac{P(Y=\\lambda|X=0)P(X=0)}{P(Y=\\lambda)} = \\frac{\\alpha p}{\\alpha} = p$.\n    $P(X=1|Y=\\lambda) = \\frac{P(Y=\\lambda|X=1)P(X=1)}{P(Y=\\lambda)} = \\frac{\\alpha (1-p)}{\\alpha} = 1-p$.\n    The conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y=\\lambda$ is the same as the original distribution of $X$. The conditional entropy is therefore $H(X|Y=\\lambda) = -[p \\log_{2}(p) + (1-p) \\log_{2}(1-p)] = H(X)$.\n\nNow we can calculate the total conditional entropy $H(X|Y)$:\n$$H(X|Y) = P(Y=0)H(X|Y=0) + P(Y=1)H(X|Y=1) + P(Y=\\lambda)H(X|Y=\\lambda)$$\n$$H(X|Y) = [p(1-\\alpha)] \\cdot 0 + [(1-p)(1-\\alpha)] \\cdot 0 + \\alpha \\cdot H(X)$$\n$$H(X|Y) = \\alpha H(X)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the mutual information:\n$$I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) = H(X) - \\alpha H(X) = (1-\\alpha)H(X)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H(X)$:\n$$I(X;Y) = (1-\\alpha)[-p \\log_{2}(p) - (1-p) \\log_{2}(1-p)]$$\nThis expression represents the mutual information between the input and output of the binary erasure channel for the given source distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(1-\\alpha)(-p \\log_{2}(p) - (1-p) \\log_{2}(1-p))}$$", "id": "1622685"}, {"introduction": "Real-world communication systems can be complex, often exhibiting different behaviors under various conditions.
