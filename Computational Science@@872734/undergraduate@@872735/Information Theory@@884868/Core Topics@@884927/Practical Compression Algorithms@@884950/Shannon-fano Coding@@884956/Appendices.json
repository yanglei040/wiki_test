The probe can send one of three distinct signal types, denoted as `{A, B, C}`. Due to the nature of the phenomenon, these signals are not sent with equal frequency. Long-term observation has established the following probabilities for each signal: the probability of signal `A` is `0.55`, the probability of signal `B` is `0.30`, and the probability of signal `C` is `0.15`.\n\nTo conserve transmission power, the probe uses a specific algorithm to generate a variable-length binary code for these signals. The algorithm follows these steps:\n1.  List the signals in descending order of their probabilities.\n2.  Divide this sorted list into two contiguous sub-groups. The division point is chosen such that the sum of probabilities in the first sub-group is as close as possible to the sum of probabilities in the second sub-group.\n3.  Assign the bit `0` as the prefix for all signals in the first sub-group and the bit `1` as the prefix for all signals in the second sub-group.\n4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 on each sub-group that contains more than one signal, appending new bits to the codes, until every signal is in a sub-group of its own.\n\nUsing this specific encoding algorithm, determine the final binary string that would be transmitted for the message sequence `ABA`.", "solution": "We apply the stated variable-length coding algorithm (Shannon-Fano style) to the signals with probabilities $p_{A} = 0.55$, $p_{B} = 0.30$, and $p_{C} = 0.15$.
