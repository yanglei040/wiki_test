This exercise provides a direct, hands-on test of this fundamental rule. By attempting to add a new codeword to an existing set, you will practice the critical skill of checking for prefix conditions to ensure the code remains instantly decodable, a core task in designing robust communication systems [@problem_id:1632857].", "problem": "A computer scientist is designing a custom binary encoding scheme for the four primary commands of a mobile robot: {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}. To ensure that the stream of commands can be decoded unambiguously and in real-time, the set of codewords must form an instantaneous code. An instantaneous code is defined as a code in which no codeword is a prefix of any other codeword.\n\nAfter some preliminary design, the scientist has assigned the following binary codewords to three of the commands:\n- The codeword for LEFT is `01`.\n- The codeword for DOWN is `110`.\n- The codeword for RIGHT is `111`.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible length of the binary codeword that can be assigned to the command UP, such that the complete set of four codewords forms a valid instantaneous code?", "solution": "An instantaneous code is prefix-free: no assigned codeword may be a prefix of any other. The given codewords are $01$, $110$, and $111$. We seek the minimum possible length $L$ for the remaining codeword (for UP) such that prefix-freeness is preserved.\n\nFirst, consider whether $L=1$ is possible. The only binary strings of length $1$ are $0$ and $1$:\n- If the codeword were $0$, then $0$ would be a prefix of the existing codeword $01$, violating prefix-freeness.\n- If the codeword were $1$, then $1$ would be a prefix of the existing codewords $110$ and $111$, violating prefix-freeness.\nTherefore, no length-$1$ codeword can be added, so $L \\ge 2$.\n\nNext, verify that a length-$2$ codeword can be added without violating prefix-freeness. The length-$2$ binary strings are $00$, $01$, $10$, and $11$. Among these:\n- $01$ is already assigned.\n- $11$ cannot be assigned because it is a prefix of $110$ and $111$, which would violate prefix-freeness.\n- Consider $00$: it is neither a prefix of $01$, $110$, or $111$, nor is any of these a prefix of $00$, since they differ within the first two bits. Hence $00$ is valid.\n- Similarly, $10$ is neither a prefix of $01$, $110$, or $111$, nor is any of these a prefix of $10$. Hence $10$ is valid.\n\nThus, there exists a valid assignment with $L=2$, so the minimum possible length is $2$.\n\nFor completeness, the Kraft inequality for binary instantaneous codes states that for codeword lengths $l_{i}$,\n$$\n\\sum_{i} 2^{-l_{i}} \\le 1.\n$$\nWith the existing lengths $2,3,3$, the sum is $2^{-2} + 2^{-3} + 2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{2}$. For the remaining codeword of length $L$, we need $2^{-L} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $L \\ge 1$. The prefix constraints exclude $L=1$, and we have exhibited feasible choices at $L=2$, confirming that the minimum possible length is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1632857"}, {"introduction": "While the prefix-free property ensures a code is decodable, true efficiency comes from optimization. This practice moves beyond simple validity to explore how to design the *best* code under specific constraints, a common engineering challenge. Here, we introduce non-uniform costs for transmitting binary digits, forcing you to think about code structure and symbol probabilities to minimize the average transmission cost, a concept that generalizes standard coding algorithms [@problem_id:1632839].", "problem": "A discrete memoryless source emits symbols from the alphabet $\\mathcal{A} = \\{A, B, C\\}$ with probabilities $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$, $P(B) = \\frac{1}{3}$, and $P(C) = \\frac{1}{6}$. These symbols are to be encoded into a sequence of binary digits $\\{0, 1\\}$ using an instantaneous code. The transmission of these binary digits incurs a cost: sending a '0' costs 1 unit, while sending a '1' costs 2 units. The cost of encoding a source symbol is the sum of the costs of the binary digits in its corresponding codeword. Your task is to design an optimal instantaneous binary code that minimizes the expected cost per source symbol. What is this minimum possible expected cost per source symbol?", "solution": "Let the cost of sending a binary digit be $c(0)=1$ and $c(1)=2$. The cost of a codeword is the sum of its digit costs. An instantaneous binary code corresponds to a binary prefix tree in which each internal node has exactly two children; otherwise, if an internal node had only one child, deleting that edge would strictly reduce the costs of all leaves below it without affecting prefix-freeness, contradicting optimality.\n\nWith three source symbols, any full binary prefix tree must have exactly three leaves and two internal nodes. Therefore, the only possible tree shapes are:\n- The root’s $1$-edge leads to a leaf (cost $2$), and the root’s $0$-edge leads to an internal node whose two children are leaves labeled $00$ and $01$, with costs $1+1=2$ and $1+2=3$. The multiset of available codeword costs is $\\{2,2,3\\}$.\n- The root’s $0$-edge leads to a leaf (cost $1$), and the root’s $1$-edge leads to an internal node whose two children are leaves labeled $10$ and $11$, with costs $2+1=3$ and $2+2=4$.
