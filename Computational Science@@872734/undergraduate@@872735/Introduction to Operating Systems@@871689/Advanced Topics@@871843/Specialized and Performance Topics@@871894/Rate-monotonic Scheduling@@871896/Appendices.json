This exercise provides a direct, hands-on comparison between two cornerstone scheduling policies: Rate-Monotonic (RM) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF). You will use precise Response-Time Analysis (RTA) to determine if a task set is schedulable under RM, and then apply the classic utilization-based test to check its schedulability under EDF, revealing the distinct capabilities of fixed-priority versus dynamic-priority scheduling [@problem_id:3675332].", "problem": "Consider a single-core processor executing three independent periodic tasks with implicit deadlines (deadline equals period), zero release offsets, and fully preemptive scheduling with negligible context-switch overhead.

It presents a standard exercise in real-time systems analysis. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis of a real-time task set on a single-core processor. The task parameters are given as:\n- Task $1$: Worst-case execution time $C_1 = 2$ ms, Period $T_1 = 5$ ms.\n- Task $2$: Worst-case execution time $C_2 = 3$ ms, Period $T_2 = 7$ ms.\n- Task $3$: Worst-case execution time $C_3 = 2$ ms, Period $T_3 = 12$ ms.\nAll tasks are independent, periodic, have implicit deadlines ($D_i = T_i$), zero release offsets, and are scheduled preemptively.\n\n**Part 1: Rate-Monotonic (RM) Scheduling Analysis**\n\nUnder Rate-Monotonic (RM) scheduling, task priorities are fixed and assigned in inverse proportion to their periods. A shorter period implies a higher priority. Given the periods $T_1 = 5$, $T_2 = 7$, and $T_3 = 12$, the priority ordering is Task $1$ (highest), Task $2$ (medium), and Task $3$ (lowest).\n\nThe problem asks for the worst-case response time $R_3$ of the lowest-priority task, derived from first principles. The worst-case response time of a task $i$ occurs at a critical instant, defined as a moment in time when a job of task $i$ is released simultaneously with jobs of all higher-priority tasks. The response time $R_i$ is the sum of the task's own execution time $C_i$ and the interference from all higher-priority tasks. The total interference from a higher-priority task $j$ (where $j \\in hp(i)$) over an interval of length $t$ is the number of times task $j$ can be released in that interval, multiplied by its execution time $C_j$. This number of releases is given by $\\lceil t/T_j \\rceil$.\n\nThis leads to the following recurrence relation for the worst-case response time $R_i$:\n$$R_i = C_i + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j$$\nThis equation can be solved iteratively:\n$$R_i^{(n+1)} = C_i + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i^{(n)}}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j$$\nThe iteration starts with an initial guess, typically $R_i^{(0)} = C_i$, and continues until two consecutive values are equal ($R_i^{(n+1)} = R_i^{(n)}$), at which point the value has converged to the exact response time. If at any point $R_i^{(n+1)}  D_i$, the task is deemed unschedulable, and the iteration can be stopped.\n\nFor our specific case, we seek to find $R_3$. The set of tasks with higher priority than Task $3$ is $hp(3) = \\{1, 2\\}$. The equation for $R_3$ is:\n$$R_3 = C_3 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{T_1} \\right\\rceil C_1 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{T_2} \\right\\rceil C_2$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values (all in milliseconds):\n$$R_3 = 2 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{5} \\right\\rceil (2) + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{7} \\right\\rceil (3)$$\nWe solve this iteratively, starting with an initial value $R_3^{(0)} = C_3 = 2$:\n- **Iteration 1:** $w_1 = C_3 + \\lceil C_3/T_1 \\rceil C_1 + \\lceil C_3/T_2 \\rceil C_2 = 2 + \\lceil 2/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 2/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (1)(2) + (1)(3) = 7$. So, $R_3^{(1)} = 7$.\n- **Iteration 2:** $w_2 = 2 + \\lceil 7/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 7/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (2)(2) + (1)(3) = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9$. So, $R_3^{(2)} = 9$.\n- **Iteration 3:** $w_3 = 2 + \\lceil 9/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 9/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (2)(2) + (2)(3) = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12$. So, $R_3^{(3)} = 12$.\n- **Iteration 4:** $w_4 = 2 + \\lceil 12/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 12/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (3)(2) + (2)(3) = 2 + 6 + 6 = 14$. So, $R_3^{(4)} = 14$.\n- **Iteration 5:** $w_5 = 2 + \\lceil 14/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 14/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (3)(2) + (2)(3) = 2 + 6 + 6 = 14$. So, $R_3^{(5)} = 14$.\n\nSince $R_3^{(5)} = R_3^{(4)}$, the sequence has converged. The exact worst-case response time for Task $3$ is $R_3 = 14$ ms.\n\nTo assess schedulability, we compare the response time to the deadline. For Task $3$, the deadline is $D_3 = T_3 = 12$ ms. Since $R_3 = 14  T_3 = 12$, Task $3$ will miss its deadline in the worst-case scenario. Therefore, the task set is **not schedulable** under RM scheduling.\n\nFor completeness, we verify the schedulability of the higher-priority tasks:\n- For Task $1$ ($hp(1) = \\emptyset$): $R_1 = C_1 = 2$ ms. Since $R_1 = 2 \\le T_1 = 5$, Task $1$ is schedulable.\n- For Task $2$ ($hp(2) = \\{1\\}$): $R_2 = C_2 + \\lceil R_2/T_1 \\rceil C_1 = 3 + \\lceil R_2/5 \\rceil (2)$. The iteration yields $R_2^{(0)}=3 \\rightarrow R_2^{(1)}=5 \\rightarrow R_2^{(2)}=5$. Thus, $R_2 = 5$ ms. Since $R_2 = 5 \\le T_2 = 7$, Task $2$ is schedulable.\nDespite Tasks $1$ and $2$ being schedulable, the failure of Task $3$ renders the entire task set unschedulable under RM.\n\n**Part 2: Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling Analysis**\n\nUnder Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling, priorities are dynamic. The job with the earliest absolute deadline is always dispatched for execution. For a set of independent, preemptive, periodic tasks with implicit deadlines ($D_i = T_i$) on a uniprocessor, a necessary and sufficient condition for schedulability is that the total processor utilization $U$ must not exceed unity.\n$$U = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{C_i}{T_i} \\le 1$$\nWe compute the total utilization for the given task set:\n$$U = \\frac{C_1}{T_1} + \\frac{C_2}{T_2} + \\frac{C_3}{T_3}$$\n$$U = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{1}{6}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $5 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 210$:\n$$U = \\frac{2 \\times 42}{210} + \\frac{3 \\times 30}{210} + \\frac{1 \\times 35}{210} = \\frac{84 + 90 + 35}{210} = \\frac{209}{210}$$\nThe total processor utilization is $U = \\frac{209}{210}$. Since $209  210$, we have $U  1$. The schedulability condition is satisfied. Therefore, the task set is **schedulable** under EDF scheduling.\n\nThe problem asks for the worst-case response time $R_3$ under RM scheduling.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the worst-case response time, $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$, for task $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$. The provided foundational facts establish that the worst-case response time for a task $T_i$, denoted $R_i$, under fixed-priority preemptive scheduling can be found using an iterative approach. The response time is the sum of the task's own worst-case execution time ($C_i$), the maximum blocking time it can experience from lower-priority tasks ($B_i$), and the interference from all higher-priority tasks. This relationship is expressed by the recurrence relation:\n$$R_i^{(k+1)} = C_i + B_i + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i^{(k)}}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j$$\nwhere $hp(i)$ is the set of tasks with priority higher than task $T_i$. The iteration starts with an initial guess, typically $R_i^{(0)} = C_i + B_i$, and continues until two successive values are equal, i.e., $R_i^{(k+1)} = R_i^{(k)}$.\n\nFirst, we assign priorities based on the Rate Monotonic (RM) scheduling policy, where priority is inversely proportional to the task period. A smaller period implies a higher priority.\n- $T_{\\mathrm{VH}}$: $T = 10 \\implies$ Priority $1$ (highest)\n- $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$: $T = 20 \\implies$ Priority $2$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{M}}$: $T = 50 \\implies$ Priority $3$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$: $T = 100 \\implies$ Priority $4$ (lowest)\n\nFor our task of interest, $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$, we have:\n- The set of higher-priority tasks, $hp(\\mathrm{H})$, is $\\{T_{\\mathrm{VH}}\\}$.\n- The set of lower-priority tasks, $lp(\\mathrm{H})$, is $\\{T_{\\mathrm{M}}, T_{\\mathrm{L}}\\}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the blocking term, $B_{\\mathrm{H}}$. According to the principles of the Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP), a task $T_i$ can be blocked by a lower-priority task $T_k$ only if $T_k$ holds a resource whose priority ceiling is greater than or equal to the priority of $T_i$. The priority ceiling of a resource is defined as the priority of the highest-priority task that accesses it.\nLet's determine the priority ceilings of the shared resources:\n- Resource $R_{1}$ is used by $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$ (Priority $2$) and $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (Priority $4$). The highest priority is $2$, so Ceiling_p($R_{1}$) = Priority $2$.\n- Resource $R_{2}$ is used by $T_{\\mathrm{M}}$ (Priority $3$) and $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (Priority $4$). The highest priority is $3$, so Ceiling_p($R_{2}$) = Priority $3$.\n\nNow we check which lower-priority tasks can block $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$ (Priority $2$):\n- Task $T_{\\mathrm{M}}$ (Priority $3$) uses $R_{2}$. The ceiling of $R_{2}$ is Priority $3$. Since Priority $3$ is lower than Priority $2$, Ceiling_p($R_2$)  Priority($T_H$). Therefore, $T_{\\mathrm{M}}$ cannot block $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$.\n- Task $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (Priority $4$) uses $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$.\n    - For $R_{1}$: Ceiling_p($R_{1}$) = Priority $2$. This is equal to Priority($T_{\\mathrm{H}}$). Thus, $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ can block $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$ when it holds the lock for $R_{1}$. The duration of this blocking is the length of $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$'s critical section on $R_{1}$, which is $3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    - For $R_{2}$: Ceiling_p($R_{2}$) = Priority $3$. This is lower than Priority($T_{\\mathrm{H}}$). Thus, $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ holding the lock for $R_{2}$ cannot block $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$.\n\nThe foundational facts state that a task can be blocked at most once by a single lower-priority critical section. The only potential source of blocking for $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is from $T_{\\mathrm{L}}$ accessing $R_{1}$.\nTherefore, the maximum blocking time for $T_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is $B_{\\mathrm{H}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nNow we can set up the iterative equation for $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$.\nThe parameters are:\n- $C_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- $B_{\\mathrm{H}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- Interference from $T_{\\mathrm{VH}}$: $T_{\\mathrm{VH}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $C_{\\mathrm{VH}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe recurrence relation for $R_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k+1)} = C_{\\mathrm{H}} + B_{\\mathrm{H}} + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k)}}{T_{\\mathrm{VH}}} \\right\\rceil C_{\\mathrm{VH}}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k+1)} = 2 + 3 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k)}}{10} \\right\\rceil \\times 1$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k+1)} = 5 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k)}}{10} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nWe start the iteration with an initial guess $R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(0)} = C_{\\mathrm{H}} + B_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n- Iteration $k=0$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(1)} = 5 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(0)}}{10} \\right\\rceil = 5 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{5}{10} \\right\\rceil = 5 + \\lceil 0.5 \\rceil = 5 + 1 = 6$$\n- Iteration $k=1$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(2)} = 5 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(1)}}{10} \\right\\rceil = 5 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{6}{10} \\right\\rceil = 5 + \\lceil 0.6 \\rceil = 5 + 1 = 6$$\n\nSince $R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(2)} = R_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(1)} = 6$, the sequence has converged.

We must provide a rigorous argument and use a specific task set for the case of $n=2$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the case for $n=1$. For a single task $\\tau_1$ with execution time $C_1$ and period $T_1$, the total utilization is $U = \\frac{C_1}{T_1}$. The Liu–Layland threshold for $n=1$ is $U_{LL}(1) = 1(2^{1/1} - 1) = 1(2 - 1) = 1$.

This condition is equivalent to stating that its utilization must satisfy $U = \\frac{C_1}{T_1} \\le 1$. For a schedulable system with $n=1$, it is therefore required that $U \\le U_{LL}(1)$. The condition requested by the problem, $U  U_{LL}(1)$, would imply $U1$, which corresponds to $C_1  T_1$. A task set with $C_1  T_1$ is inherently unschedulable.

The worst-case response time for $\\tau_2$ is $R_2 = 4$.\nThe schedulability condition is $R_2 \\le D_2$. We have $4 \\le 4$, which is true. Thus, $\\tau_2$ is also schedulable.\nSince both tasks are schedulable, the entire task set is schedulable under RMS. This result is also confirmed by the known property that a harmonic task set with implicit deadlines is schedulable if and only if its total utilization $U \\le 1$. Our task set is harmonic ($T_2 = 2T_1$) and has $U=1$.\n\nThe third step is to compare the computed utilization $U$ to the Liu–Layland threshold for $n=2$.\n$$ U_{LL}(2) = 2(2^{1/2} - 1) = 2(\\sqrt{2} - 1) $$\nWe must verify if $U  U_{LL}(2)$:\n$$ 1  2(\\sqrt{2} - 1) $$\n$$ 1  2\\sqrt{2} - 2 $$\n$$ 3  2\\sqrt{2} $$\nSquaring both sides (which is a valid operation since both sides are positive):\n$$ 3^2  (2\\sqrt{2})^2 $$\n$$ 9  4 \\times 2 $$\n$$ 9  8 $$\nThe inequality is true. Therefore, the total utilization $U=1$ of this schedulable task set is strictly greater than the Liu–Layland bound for $n=2$.\n\nTo summarize the argument:\n1.  We established that for $n=1$, no schedulable task set can have a utilization $U$ that exceeds the corresponding Liu–Layland bound $U_{LL}(1)=1$.\n2.  We demonstrated for $n=2$ that the given task set is schedulable (via RTA) and its total utilization $U=1$ strictly exceeds the Liu–Layland bound $U_{LL}(2) = 2(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which such a task set exists is $n=2$. The problem asks for the pair $(n, U)$ for this case. We have found $n=2$ and the corresponding total utilization is $U=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3675379"}]}
