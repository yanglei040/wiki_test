Consider a single latency-sensitive CPU-bound task on a smartphone System on Chip (SoC). The task requires $W$ CPU cycles and has a relative deadline $d$ seconds from its release time. The scheduler must choose a constant CPU frequency $f$ (in hertz) for the duration of the task to balance energy and tail latency.\n\nUse the following fundamental base to model energy:\n\n- Dynamic power $P$ for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic scales as $P = \\alpha C V^{2} f$, where $\\alpha$ is the activity factor, $C$ is the effective switched capacitance, $V$ is supply voltage, and $f$ is clock frequency.\n- In the DVFS operating region of interest, assume $V$ is approximately proportional to $f$, that is, $V = \\theta f$ for some proportionality constant $\\theta  0$.\n- The task’s execution time at constant frequency is $t = \\frac{W}{f}$.\n\nFrom these bases, define the minimum energy profile $E(f)$ for completing the $W$ cycles at frequency $f$ by eliminating $V$ and expressing energy as a function of $f$ and $W$, introducing a constant $\\kappa \\equiv \\alpha C \\theta^{2}$ to collect device parameters.

We shall proceed by first deriving an explicit expression for the cost function $J(f)$ and then using calculus to find the frequency that minimizes it.\n\nFirst, we derive the energy profile $E(f)$. The energy $E$ consumed by the task is the product of the dynamic power $P$ and the execution time $t$.\n$$\nE(f) = P \\cdot t\n$$\nThe problem provides the following relationships:\n$1$. The dynamic power is $P = \\alpha C V^{2} f$.\n$2$. The supply voltage $V$ is proportional to the frequency $f$, i.e., $V = \\theta f$.\n$3$. The execution time is $t = \\frac{W}{f}$ for a task requiring $W$ cycles.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $P$ and $t$ into the energy equation, we get:\n$$\nE(f) = (\\alpha C V^{2} f) \\left(\\frac{W}{f}\\right) = \\alpha C V^{2} W\n$$\nNow, we substitute the voltage-frequency relationship $V = \\theta f$:\n$$\nE(f) = \\alpha C (\\theta f)^{2} W = \\alpha C \\theta^{2} f^{2} W\n$$\nThe problem defines a constant $\\kappa \\equiv \\alpha C \\theta^{2}$ to consolidate the device-specific parameters. Using this constant, the energy profile simplifies to:\n$$\nE(f) = \\kappa W f^{2}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the energy required to complete the task scales with the square of the frequency.\n\nNext, we establish the full cost function $J(f)$. The cost is the sum of the energy $E(f)$ and the latency penalty $\\beta L(f)$. The lateness $L(f)$ is defined as $L(f) \\equiv \\max\\{0, \\frac{W}{f} - d\\}$, where $t = \\frac{W}{f}$ is the execution time and $d$ is the deadline.\nThe total cost function is therefore:\n$$\nJ(f) = \\kappa W f^{2} + \\beta \\max\\left\\{0, \\frac{W}{f} - d\\right\\}\n$$\nThis function is piecewise. The form of the function depends on whether the execution time $\\frac{W}{f}$ is greater than the deadline $d$.\nCase 1: The task meets or beats the deadline. This occurs if $\\frac{W}{f} \\le d$, which corresponds to $f \\ge \\frac{W}{d}$. In this case, $\\frac{W}{f} - d \\le 0$, so $\\max\\{0, \\frac{W}{f} - d\\} = 0$. The cost function is:\n$$\nJ(f) = \\kappa W f^{2} \\quad \\text{for } f \\ge \\frac{W}{d}\n$$\nCase 2: The task misses the deadline. This occurs if $\\frac{W}{f}  d$, which corresponds to $f  \\frac{W}{d}$. In this case, $\\frac{W}{f} - d  0$, so $\\max\\{0, \\frac{W}{f} - d\\} = \\frac{W}{f} - d$. The cost function is:\n$$\nJ(f) = \\kappa W f^{2} + \\beta \\left(\\frac{W}{f} - d\\right) \\quad \\text{for } f  \\frac{W}{d}\n$$\nThe problem statement includes a crucial assumption: the optimal frequency $f^{\\star}$ lies in the regime where the task completes after the deadline. This implies that the minimum of $J(f)$ occurs for a frequency $f^{\\star}  \\frac{W}{d}$. Therefore, we need to find the minimum of the function from Case 2. Let us denote this function as $J_{2}(f)$:\n$$\nJ_{2}(f) = \\kappa W f^{2} + \\frac{\\beta W}{f} - \\beta d\n$$\nTo find the frequency that minimizes $J_{2}(f)$, we compute its derivative with respect to $f$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_{2}}{df} = \\frac{d}{df} \\left( \\kappa W f^{2} + \\beta W f^{-1} - \\beta d \\right) = 2\\kappa W f - \\beta W f^{-2}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point $f_{c}$:\n$$\n2\\kappa W f_{c} - \\frac{\\beta W}{f_{c}^{2}} = 0\n$$\nSince $f$ must be positive, we can multiply by $f_{c}^{2}$:\n$$\n2\\kappa W f_{c}^{3} - \\beta W = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\kappa W f_{c}^{3} = \\beta W\n$$\nAssuming $W  0$, we can divide by $W$:\n$$\n2\\kappa f_{c}^{3} = \\beta\n$$\n$$\nf_{c}^{3} = \\frac{\\beta}{2\\kappa}\n$$\nSolving for $f_{c}$:\n$$\nf_{c} = \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\kappa}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a minimum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}J_{2}}{df^{2}} = \\frac{d}{df} \\left( 2\\kappa W f - \\beta W f^{-2} \\right) = 2\\kappa W + 2\\beta W f^{-3} = 2\\kappa W + \\frac{2\\beta W}{f^{3}}\n$$\nSince $\\kappa$, $W$, and $\\beta$ are all positive, and $f0$, the second derivative $\\frac{d^{2}J_{2}}{df^{2}}$ is always positive. This confirms that $J_{2}(f)$ is a convex function, and the critical point $f_{c}$ is its unique minimum.\n\nThe optimal frequency $f^{\\star}$ is this critical point $f_{c}$, provided that it lies within the domain for which $J_{2}(f)$ is the correct expression for the cost, i.e., $f_{c}  \\frac{W}{d}$. The problem provides exactly this condition as an assumption:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\kappa}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}  \\frac{W}{d}\n$$\nThis confirms that the minimum of $J_{2}(f)$ occurs within the interval $(0, \\frac{W}{d})$. For $f \\ge \\frac{W}{d}$, the cost function is $J(f) = \\kappa W f^2$, which is strictly increasing. Therefore, the global minimum of the total cost function $J(f)$ must be the minimum found in the $f  \\frac{W}{d}$ region.\n\nThus, the optimal frequency $f^{\\star}$ is:\n$$\nf^{\\star} = \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\kappa}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the frequency that minimizes the total cost.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\kappa}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}}$$", "id": "3670020"}, {"introduction": "Beyond active computation, managing storage I/O is critical for energy efficiency and system reliability.
