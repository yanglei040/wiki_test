It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nThe system consists of $N$ identical, non-interacting magnetic moments (spins), each of magnitude $\\mu$. In a magnetic field $B$, a single spin $s_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$ has energy states $E_{\\pm} = \\mp \\mu B$. The system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$. The inverse temperature is $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFirst, we must derive the canonical partition function, from which all thermodynamic quantities can be obtained. For a single spin, the partition function $z$ is the sum of Boltzmann factors over its two states:\n$$z = e^{-\\beta E_{+1}} + e^{-\\beta E_{-1}} = e^{-\\beta(-\\mu B)} + e^{-\\beta(+\\mu B)} = e^{\\beta \\mu B} + e^{-\\beta \\mu B} = 2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)$$\nSince the $N$ spins are independent, the total partition function $Z$ for the system is the product of the single-spin partition functions:\n$$Z = z^N = \\left[ 2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B) \\right]^N$$\nThe logarithm of the partition function is $\\ln Z = N \\ln\\left[2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)\\right]$. For convenience, we define the dimensionless variable $x = \\beta \\mu B = \\frac{\\mu B}{k_B T}$. Thus, $\\ln Z = N \\ln\\left[2 \\cosh(x)\\right]$.\n\nThe average energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ and average total magnetic moment $\\langle M \\rangle$ are derived from $\\ln Z$:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left[ N \\ln\\left(2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)\\right) \\right] = -N \\frac{1}{2\\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)} \\cdot 2\\sinh(\\beta \\mu B) \\cdot \\mu B$$\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = -N \\mu B \\tanh(\\beta \\mu B) = -N \\mu B \\tanh(x)$$\nThe total energy is $E = -MB$, so $\\langle E \\rangle = -\\langle M \\rangle B$. This implies:\n$$\\langle M \\rangle = N \\mu \\tanh(\\beta \\mu B) = N \\mu \\tanh(x)$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of heat capacity $C_V$ and magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ by two distinct methods prescribed by statistical mechanics.\n\n**Method 1: Calculation from Fluctuations**\n\nThe first method utilizes the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which relates response functions ($C_V$, $\\chi$) to the variance of thermodynamic quantities ($E$, $M$).\n\nThe heat capacity at constant volume is given by $C_V = \\langle (\\Delta E)^2 \\rangle / (k_B T^2)$, where the energy variance is $\\langle (\\Delta E)^2 \\rangle = \\langle E^2 \\rangle - \\langle E \\rangle^2 = -\\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta}$.\n$$\\langle (\\Delta E)^2 \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} [-N \\mu B \\tanh(\\beta \\mu B)] = N \\mu B \\cdot \\text{sech}^2(\\beta \\mu B) \\cdot \\mu B = N(\\mu B)^2 \\text{sech}^2(x)$$\nTherefore, the heat capacity from fluctuations, $C_V^{\\mathrm{fluct}}$, is:\n$$C_V^{\\mathrm{fluct}} = \\frac{N(\\mu B)^2 \\text{sech}^2(x)}{k_B T^2} = \\frac{N(k_B T x)^2 \\text{sech}^2(x)}{k_B T^2} = N k_B x^2 \\text{sech}^2(x)$$\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility is given by $\\chi = \\beta \\langle (\\Delta M)^2 \\rangle$, where the magnetization variance is $\\langle (\\Delta M)^2 \\rangle = \\langle M^2 \\rangle - \\langle M \\rangle^2 = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\frac{\\partial \\langle M \\rangle}{\\partial B}$.\n$$\\langle (\\Delta M)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial B} [N\\mu \\tanh(\\beta \\mu B)] = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left[ N\\mu \\cdot \\text{sech}^2(\\beta \\mu B) \\cdot \\beta \\mu \\right] = N \\mu^2 \\text{sech}^2(x)$$\nTherefore, the magnetic susceptibility from fluctuations, $\\chi^{\\mathrm{fluct}}$, is:\n$$\\chi^{\\mathrm{fluct}} = \\beta (N \\mu^2 \\text{sech}^2(x)) = \\frac{N \\mu^2}{k_B T} \\text{sech}^2(x)$$\n\n**Method 2: Calculation from Numerical Differentiation**\n\nThe second method uses the thermodynamic definitions of $C_V$ and $\\chi$ as derivatives of average quantities. These must be computed numerically.\n\nThe heat capacity is the derivative of average energy with respect to temperature: $C_V = (\\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle}{\\partial T})_B$. We approximate this derivative using a central finite difference formula with a small step size $h_T$:\n$$C_V^{\\mathrm{num}} = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle(T+h_T, B) - \\langle E \\rangle(T-h_T, B)}{2h_T}$$\nwhere $\\langle E \\rangle(T, B) = -N\\mu B \\tanh(\\frac{\\mu B}{k_B T})$. We choose a relative step size $h_T = \\delta_T \\cdot T$ with $\\delta_T = 10^{-6}$ for numerical stability.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility is the derivative of average magnetization with respect to the magnetic field: $\\chi = (\\frac{\\partial \\langle M \\rangle}{\\partial B})_T$. We again use a central finite difference formula with step size $h_B$:\n$$\\chi^{\\mathrm{num}} = \\frac{\\langle M \\rangle(T, B+h_B) - \\langle M \\rangle(T, B-h_B)}{2h_B}$$\nwhere $\\langle M \\rangle(T, B) = N\\mu \\tanh(\\frac{\\mu B}{k_B T})$. The choice of step size $h_B$ requires care. If $B \\neq 0$, a relative step $h_B = \\delta_B \\cdot B$ with $\\delta_B = 10^{-6}$ is appropriate. However, for the case $B=0$, this would yield a zero step. In this special case, we must use a small absolute step, $h_B = h_{abs}$ (e.g., $10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{T}$), to evaluate the derivative at the origin.\n\n**Final Computation**\n\nFor each parameter set $(N, \\mu, B, T)$ given in the test suite, we will compute:\n1.  $C_V^{\\mathrm{fluct}} = N k_B (\\frac{\\mu B}{k_B T})^2 \\text{sech}^2(\\frac{\\mu B}{k_B T})$\n2.  $C_V^{\\mathrm{num}}$ via numerical differentiation of $\\langle E \\rangle(T)$\n3.  $\\chi^{\\mathrm{fluct}} = \\frac{N \\mu^2}{k_B T} \\text{sech}^2(\\frac{\\mu B}{k_B T})$\n4.  $\\chi^{\\mathrm{num}}$ via numerical differentiation of $\\langle M \\rangle(B)$\n\nFinally, we will calculate the absolute differences $|C_V^{\\mathrm{fluct}} - C_V^{\\mathrm{num}}|$ and $|\\chi^{\\mathrm{fluct}} - \\chi^{\\mathrm{num}}|$. These differences are expected to be very small, arising solely from the truncation error of the finite difference approximation, which is of order $O(h^2)$.

A stable expression for the logarithm of the partition function is required:\n$$\n\\ln Z_N(\\beta,h) = \\ln(\\lambda_{\\max}^N + \\lambda_{\\min}^N) = \\ln\\left(\\lambda_{\\max}^N \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{\\lambda_{\\max}}\\right)^N\\right)\\right) = N \\ln \\lambda_{\\max} + \\ln\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{\\lambda_{\\max}}\\right)^N\\right)\n$$\nThis expression avoids overflow and is used for all subsequent calculations.\n\nThe thermodynamic quantities are derived from $\\ln Z_N$.

For a function $f(x)$, the second derivative is approximated as:\n$$\nf''(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+\\delta) - 2f(x) + f(x-\\delta)}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nFor the heat capacity, we compute the derivative of $\\ln Z_N$ with respect to $\\beta$ at $h=0$ using a step $\\delta_\\beta = 10^{-5}$.\nFor the susceptibility, we compute the derivative of $\\ln Z_N$ with respect to $h$ at $h=0$ using a step $\\delta_h = 10^{-4}$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  A function is implemented to calculate the two eigenvalues, $\\lambda_{\\max}$ and $\\lambda_{\\min}$, for given $\\beta$ and $h$ using the analytical formula.\n2.  A function for $\\ln Z_N(\\beta,h)$ is implemented using the numerically stable expression.\n3.

For each $N$, the maximum value on this grid, $c_N^{\\max}$, is found.\n4.  The differences in peak heights, $\\Delta_{64,16} = c_{64}^{\\max} - c_{16}^{\\max}$ and $\\Delta_{256,64} = c_{256}^{\\max} - c_{64}^{\\max}$, are calculated.\n5.  An indicator $I$ is determined: $I=1$ if both $\\Delta_{256,64} < \\Delta_{64,16}$ and $\\max(\\Delta_{64,16}, \\Delta_{256,64}) < 0.05$ are true, otherwise $I=0$.

Finite-size scaling is the essential theoretical and computational tool for studying these critical phenomena using simulations on finite systems [@problem_id:2400586]. This final practice shifts the focus from simulation to data analysis, guiding you to extract the universal critical exponent $\\gamma$ from mock simulation data and revealing how macroscopic laws emerge from scaling behavior near a critical point.", "problem": "You are given a set of independent, dimensionless numerical experiments on lattice spin systems of linear extent $L$ in spatial dimension $d$, each reporting the peak value of the zero-field magnetic susceptibility, denoted $\\chi_{\\max}(L)$, measured near the system’s pseudo-critical temperature for that finite size. Your goal is to estimate the critical exponent $\\gamma$ for each experiment using finite-size scaling, starting from a fundamental scaling hypothesis and proceeding to an algorithmic estimator.\n\nStart from the finite-size scaling ansatz for the singular part of the reduced free-energy density,\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{s}}(t,h,L) = L^{-d}\\,\\mathcal{F}\\!\\left(t\\,L^{1/\\nu},\\,h\\,L^{y_h}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $t$ is the reduced temperature, $h$ is the external magnetic field, $\\nu$ is the correlation-length exponent, $y_h$ is the renormalization-group field exponent conjugate to $h$, and $\\mathcal{F}$ is a scaling function. Use standard thermodynamic definitions to express the zero-field susceptibility per site as the second field derivative of the free-energy density, and infer the finite-size scaling form of $\\chi(t,L)$ at $h=0$. Argue that the peak value $\\chi_{\\max}(L)$, obtained at the pseudo-critical reduced temperature $t^\\star(L)$ where $\\chi$ attains its maximum for that $L$, scales as a power of $L$ with an exponent that can be expressed using $\\nu$ and $\\gamma$. Derive a regression-ready relation by taking logarithms, and explain how to extract $\\gamma$ from a linear fit, given an independently specified value of $\\nu$.\n\nThen implement an algorithm that, for each experiment, performs the following steps:\n- Given a list of system sizes $L_i$ and corresponding measured $\\chi_{\\max}(L_i)$, compute the natural logarithms of both quantities and perform an unweighted linear least-squares fit of $\\ln \\chi_{\\max}$ versus $\\ln L$ to estimate the scaling slope.\n- Using the provided value of $\\nu$ for that experiment, convert the fitted slope into an estimate of $\\gamma$.\n- Return the estimates of $\\gamma$ for all experiments.\n\nAll quantities are dimensionless in this problem, so no physical units are required.\n\nYour program must apply the above procedure to the following test suite.

It describes a standard procedure in computational statistical physics for determining a critical exponent from finite-size data, based on the established theory of finite-size scaling. All required data and theoretical premises are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an estimator for the critical exponent $\\gamma$ from the provided finite-size scaling ansatz for the singular part of the free-energy density, $f_{\\mathrm{s}}$, and then apply it to the given experimental data.\n\nThe starting point is the finite-size scaling form of the singular part of the reduced free-energy density per site:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{s}}(t,h,L) = L^{-d}\\,\\mathcal{F}\\!\\left(t\\,L^{1/\\nu},\\,h\\,L^{y_h}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $t$ is the reduced temperature $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$, $h$ is the external magnetic field, $L$ is the linear system size, $d$ is the spatial dimension, $\\nu$ is the correlation-length critical exponent, and $y_h$ is the magnetic scaling exponent. The function $\\mathcal{F}$ is a universal scaling function.\n\nThe zero-field magnetic susceptibility per site, $\\chi$, is defined as the second derivative of the free-energy density with respect to the magnetic field, evaluated at $h=0$:\n$$\n\\chi(t,h) = -\\frac{\\partial^2 f(t,h)}{\\partial h^2}\n$$\nThe total free energy $f$ is the sum of a regular part $f_{\\mathrm{reg}}$ and the singular part $f_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Near the critical point, the singular behavior is dominated by $f_{\\mathrm{s}}$, so we focus on the scaling of the singular part of the susceptibility, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Differentiating $f_{\\mathrm{s}}$ with respect to $h$, we apply the chain rule. Let $x_t = tL^{1/\\nu}$ and $x_h = hL^{y_h}$ be the arguments of $\\mathcal{F}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\partial h} = L^{-d} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}(x_t, x_h)}{\\partial x_h} \\frac{\\partial x_h}{\\partial h} = L^{-d} \\mathcal{F}^{(0,1)}(x_t, x_h) L^{y_h}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{F}^{(i,j)}$ denotes the $i$-th partial derivative with respect to the first argument and the $j$-th with respect to the second. The second derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\partial h^2} = L^{-d} L^{y_h} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h} \\left(\\mathcal{F}^{(0,1)}(x_t, x_h)\\right) = L^{-d} L^{y_h} \\left( \\mathcal{F}^{(0,2)}(x_t, x_h) \\frac{\\partial x_h}{\\partial h} \\right) = L^{-d} (L^{y_h})^2 \\mathcal{F}^{(0,2)}(x_t, x_h)\n$$\nThus, the singular part of the susceptibility is:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\mathrm{s}}(t,h,L) = -L^{2y_h-d} \\mathcal{F}^{(0,2)}(tL^{1/\\nu}, hL^{y_h})\n$$\nWe are interested in the zero-field susceptibility, so we set $h=0$:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\mathrm{s}}(t,0,L) = L^{2y_h-d} \\left[-\\mathcal{F}^{(0,2)}(tL^{1/\\nu}, 0)\\right]\n$$\nLet us define a new scaling function $\\mathcal{G}(x) = -\\mathcal{F}^{(0,2)}(x, 0)$. The expression then simplifies to:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\mathrm{s}}(t,0,L) = L^{2y_h-d} \\mathcal{G}(tL^{1/\\nu})\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\chi_{\\max}(L)$ is the peak value of the susceptibility, which for a finite system occurs at a pseudo-critical temperature $t^\\star(L)$. This corresponds to the argument of $\\mathcal{G}$ having a value $x^\\star = t^\\star(L)L^{1/\\nu}$ that maximizes the function $\\mathcal{G}(x)$. Since $x^\\star$ and $\\mathcal{G}(x^\\star)$ are constants for large $L$, the scaling of the peak susceptibility is determined entirely by the prefactor involving $L$:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\max}(L) \\equiv \\chi(t^\\star(L), 0, L) \\propto L^{2y_h-d}\n$$\nTo connect this to the conventional critical exponent $\\gamma$, we use standard scaling relations. The scaling exponent of the magnetic field, $y_h$, is related to the anomalous dimension exponent $\\eta$ by $2y_h = d+2-\\eta$. Substituting this gives the exponent of $L$ as:\n$$\n2y_h-d = (d+2-\\eta) - d = 2-\\eta\n$$\nFurthermore, the hyperscaling relation $\\gamma = \\nu(2-\\eta)$ connects $\\gamma$, $\\nu$, and $\\eta$. From this, we have $2-\\eta = \\gamma/\\nu$. Therefore, the scaling of the peak susceptibility is given by:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\max}(L) \\propto L^{\\gamma/\\nu}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental power-law relation we must use. To extract the exponent $\\gamma/\\nu$ from the provided data, we linearize this relationship by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln \\chi_{\\max}(L) = \\ln(C) + \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\nu}\\right) \\ln L\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of proportionality. This equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = m x + c$, with:\n- Dependent variable $y = \\ln \\chi_{\\max}(L)$.\n- Independent variable $x = \\ln L$.\n- Slope $m = \\gamma/\\nu$.\n- Intercept $c = \\ln(C)$.\n\nThe prescribed algorithm is to perform a linear least-squares regression on the data points $(\\ln L_i, \\ln \\chi_{\\max}(L_i))$ for each experiment. This fit yields an estimate for the slope, $\\hat{m}$. Given the known value of $\\nu$ for the experiment, the estimate for the critical exponent $\\gamma$ is then calculated as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma} = \\hat{m} \\cdot \\nu\n$$\nThe implementation will follow this procedure for each of the four experimental datasets. A linear regression will be performed on the logarithmically transformed data to find the slope, from which $\\gamma$ will be computed.\nThe final results for each experiment will be collected and formatted as requested.
