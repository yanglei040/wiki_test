The condition for the 2D anisotropic wave equation is $S = \\Delta t \\sqrt{ (c_x/\\Delta x)^2 + (c_y/\\Delta y)^2 } \\leq 1$. Let's check this for each case:\n    - Case A: $\\Delta x = 1/(80)$, $\\Delta y = 1/(80)$. $S = 0.005 \\sqrt{(1.0/(1/80))^2 + (2.0/(1/80))^2} = 0.005 \\sqrt{80^2 + 160^2} \\approx 0.894  1$.

Stable.\n    - Case C: $\\Delta x = 1/(64)$, $\\Delta y = 1/(64)$. $S = 0.0047 \\sqrt{(2.0/(1/64))^2 + (2.5/(1/64))^2} = 0.0047 \\sqrt{128^2 + 160^2} \\approx 0.963  1$. Stable.\nAll test cases use parameters that result in a stable numerical scheme.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically sound, and numerically tractable problem. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is constructed using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. We discretize the spatial domain into a grid $\\{ (x_i, y_j) | x_i = i\\Delta x, y_j = j\\Delta y \\}$ for $i \\in \\{0, ..., N_x-1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, ..., N_y-1\\}$, and time as $t_k = k\\Delta t$. Let $u_{i,j}^k$ be the numerical approximation of $u(x_i, y_j, t_k)$.\n\nThe second-order partial derivatives are approximated using second-order central difference formulas:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}\\Bigg|_{i,j,k} \\approx \\frac{u_{i,j}^{k+1} - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i,j}^{k-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\Bigg|_{i,j,k} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^k - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i-1,j}^k}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\Bigg|_{i,j,k} \\approx \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^k - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i,j-1}^k}{(\\Delta y)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the governing PDE yields the explicit update scheme. For all interior grid points $(i,j)$ where $1 \\leq i \\leq N_x-2$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq N_y-2$:\n$$\n\\frac{u_{i,j}^{k+1} - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i,j}^{k-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2} = c_x^2 \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^k - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i-1,j}^k}{(\\Delta x)^2} + c_y^2 \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^k - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i,j-1}^k}{(\\Delta y)^2}\n$$\nSolving for $u_{i,j}^{k+1}$, we obtain the three-level time-stepping scheme:\n$$\nu_{i,j}^{k+1} = 2u_{i,j}^k - u_{i,j}^{k-1} + \\left(\\frac{c_x \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2(u_{i+1,j}^k - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i-1,j}^k) + \\left(\\frac{c_y \\Delta t}{\\Delta y}\\right)^2(u_{i,j+1}^k - 2u_{i,j}^k + u_{i,j-1}^k)\n$$\nThis formula computes the solution at time step $k+1$ from the solutions at steps $k$ and $k-1$. This applies for $k \\geq 1$.\n\nFor the first time step ($k=0$), we must use the initial conditions. The state $u_{i,j}^0$ is given by $u(x_i, y_j, 0)$. To find $u_{i,j}^1$, we need the fictitious state $u_{i,j}^{-1}$. This is obtained by discretizing the initial velocity condition, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,y,0)=0$, using a central difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\Bigg|_{i,j,0} \\approx \\frac{u_{i,j}^1 - u_{i,j}^{-1}}{2\\Delta t} = 0 \\implies u_{i,j}^{-1} = u_{i,j}^1\n$$\nSubstituting $u_{i,j}^{-1} = u_{i,j}^1$ into the general update formula for $k=0$:\n$$\nu_{i,j}^1 = 2u_{i,j}^0 - u_{i,j}^1 + (\\Delta t)^2 \\left[ c_x^2 \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^0 - 2u_{i,j}^0 + u_{i-1,j}^0}{\\Delta x^2} + c_y^2 \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^0 - 2u_{i,j}^0 + u_{i,j-1}^0}{\\Delta y^2} \\right]\n$$\nSolving for $u_{i,j}^1$ gives a two-level scheme for the first step:\n$$\nu_{i,j}^1 = u_{i,j}^0 + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2} \\left[ c_x^2 \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^0 - 2u_{i,j}^0 + u_{i-1,j}^0}{\\Delta x^2} + c_y^2 \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^0 - 2u_{i,j}^0 + u_{i,j-1}^0}{\\Delta y^2} \\right]\n$$\nThe homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u=0$ are enforced by setting the values on the borders of the numerical grid to zero for all time steps.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize parameters and create the spatial grid.\n2.  Compute the initial state $u^0$ at $t=0$. This array will represent the solution at the \"previous\" time step, $u_{\\text{prev}}$.\n3.  Compute the state $u^1$ at $t=\\Delta t$ using the special first-step formula. This array represents the \"current\" solution, $u_{\\text{curr}}$.\n4.  Iterate from $k=1$ to $N-1$:\n    a. Calculate the next state $u^{k+1}$ using the general three-level update formula, from $u_{\\text{curr}} (= u^k)$ and $u_{\\text{prev}} (= u^{k-1})$.\n    b. Update the state arrays for the next iteration: $u_{\\text{prev}}$ becomes $u_{\\text{curr}}$, and $u_{\\text{curr}}$ becomes the newly computed $u^{k+1}$. This is managed efficiently to avoid repeated memory allocation.\n5.  After $N$ steps, the array $u_{\\text{curr}}$ holds the numerical solution at the final time $t_N = N \\Delta t$.\n6.  Compute the exact solution on the same grid at $t_N$.\n7.  Calculate the maximum absolute error by comparing the numerical and exact solutions point-wise over the entire grid.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each test case.

We are given $\\Delta x = \\Delta y$.\n\nWe discretize the partial derivatives using second-order accurate central difference approximations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} \\approx \\frac{p_{i,j}^{n+1} - 2p_{i,j}^n + p_{i,j}^{n-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla^2 p \\approx \\frac{p_{i+1,j}^n - 2p_{i,j}^n + p_{i-1,j}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{p_{i,j+1}^n - 2p_{i,j}^n + p_{i,j-1}^n}{(\\Delta y)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the wave equation and noting that $\\Delta x = \\Delta y$, we obtain the discrete update equation:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i,j}^{n+1} - 2p_{i,j}^n + p_{i,j}^{n-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{p_{i+1,j}^n + p_{i-1,j}^n + p_{i,j+1}^n + p_{i,j-1}^n - 4p_{i,j}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for the pressure at the next time step, $p_{i,j}^{n+1}$, yields the explicit FDTD scheme:\n$$\np_{i,j}^{n+1} = 2p_{i,j}^n - p_{i,j}^{n-1} + \\left(\\frac{c\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 \\left( p_{i+1,j}^n + p_{i-1,j}^n + p_{i,j+1}^n + p_{i,j-1}^n - 4p_{i,j}^n \\right)\n$$\nThe quantity $s = c\\Delta t/\\Delta x$ is the Courant number. The update equation is then:\n$$\np_{i,j}^{n+1} = 2p_{i,j}^n - p_{i,j}^{n-1} + s^2 \\left( p_{i+1,j}^n + p_{i-1,j}^n + p_{i,j+1}^n + p_{i,j-1}^n - 4p_{i,j}^n \\right)\n$$\nFor this explicit scheme to be numerically stable in two dimensions with $\\Delta x = \\Delta y$, the Courant number $s$ must satisfy the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition:\n$$\ns \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.7071\n$$\nThe specified Courant number $s = 0.5$ adheres to this condition, ensuring stability.\n\nThe simulation starts from a state of rest, meaning the initial conditions are $p(x,y,0) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}(x,y,0) = 0$. In discrete form, $p_{i,j}^0 = 0$. The zero-velocity condition is implemented using a central difference for the time derivative at $n=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i,j}^1 - p_{i,j}^{-1}}{2\\Delta t} = 0 \\implies p_{i,j}^{-1} = p_{i,j}^1\n$$\nWith resting initial conditions, this simplifies the time evolution. The source is applied at time index $n=0$, affecting the computation of the pressure field at time index $n=1$. The update for $p_{i,j}^1$ will therefore include a source term at the source location $(i_s, j_s)$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are of the rigid-wall (Neumann) type, $\\partial p / \\partial n = 0$, where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing normal vector. For the wall at $x=0$, this is $\\partial p / \\partial x = 0$. Discretizing this condition with a second-order central difference at the boundary node $i=0$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{1,j}^n - p_{-1,j}^n}{2\\Delta x} = 0 \\implies p_{-1,j}^n = p_{1,j}^n\n$$\nwhere $p_{-1,j}^n$ is the pressure at a \"ghost point\" outside the domain. This ghost point value is used in the main update stencil for boundary points. For example, at $i=0$, the term $p_{i-1,j}^n$ becomes $p_{1,j}^n$. The update rule for a point on the left wall ($i=0$) becomes:\n$$\np_{0,j}^{n+1} = 2p_{0,j}^n - p_{0,j}^{n-1} + s^2 \\left( 2p_{1,j}^n + p_{0,j+1}^n + p_{0,j-1}^n - 4p_{0,j}^n \\right)\n$$\nAnalogous rules apply to the other three walls and the four corners. A systematic way to implement this is to pad the pressure grid with a layer of ghost cells and populate them according to these relations before each spatial derivative calculation.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by iteratively applying the update equation for a total number of time steps $N_t = \\lfloor T/\\Delta t \\rfloor$. At each step, the pressure at the receiver location $(i_r, j_r)$ is recorded, forming a time series.\n\nFor frequency analysis, the recorded time series is first processed by removing its mean to eliminate the DC component. Then, a Hann window is applied to reduce spectral leakage. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the windowed signal is computed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, yielding the magnitude spectrum.\n\nThe analytical eigenfrequencies for the given domain with Neumann boundary conditions are:\n$$\nf_{m,n} = \\frac{c}{2}\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{m}{L_x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n}{L_y}\\right)^2}\n$$\nwhere $m, n$ are non-negative integers, not both zero. For each test case, we compute the three lowest distinct non-zero analytical frequencies.\n\nFor each analytical frequency $f_{\\text{anal}}$, we search for its measured counterpart, $\\hat{f}_{\\text{meas}}$, in the computed spectrum. The search is conducted within a frequency window centered at $f_{\\text{anal}}$ with a width of $\\max(5 \\text{ Hz}, 0.15 f_{\\text{anal}})$. This window is clamped to the specified analysis band of $[20 \\text{ Hz}, 300 \\text{ Hz}]$. The frequency corresponding to the maximum magnitude peak within this search window is taken as $\\hat{f}_{\\text{meas}}$.\n\nFinally, the absolute relative error for each modal frequency is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{Error} = \\frac{|\\hat{f}_{\\text{meas}} - f_{\\text{anal}}|}{f_{\\text{anal}}}\n$$\nThis procedure is repeated for all three test cases, and the nine resulting error values are reported.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import fft\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the test suite and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (Lx, Ly)\n        (3.0, 4.0),  # Case 1\n        (2.0, 2.0),  # Case 2\n        (5.0, 2.0),  # Case 3\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for Lx, Ly in test_cases:\n        errors = run_simulation_and_analyze(Lx, Ly)\n        all_results.extend(errors)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{r:.10f}' for r in all_results)}]\")\n\ndef run_simulation_and_analyze(Lx, Ly):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs the FDTD simulation for a given geometry and analyzes the results.\n    Returns a list of three relative frequency errors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.

It presents a well-posed initial-boundary value problem for the one-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation, a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. All parameters, conditions, and objectives are specified with sufficient clarity and scientific rigor to permit a unique numerical solution.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE):\n$$\ni \\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\hat{H} \\psi(x,t)\n$$\nwhere the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$ is the sum of the kinetic energy operator $\\hat{T}$ and the potential energy operator $\\hat{V}$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V(x)\n$$\nwith constants $\\hbar=1$ and $m=1$. Since the kinetic and potential operators, $\\hat{T}$ and $\\hat{V}$, do not commute in general, the time-evolution operator $e^{-i\\hat{H}\\Delta t}$ cannot be naively factored.\n\nThe most appropriate and efficient numerical method for this class of problems is the **Split-Step Fourier Method**. We employ a second-order symmetric splitting scheme, also known as Strang splitting, which is both accurate and unitary, thus conserving the norm $|\\psi|^2$ over time. This scheme approximates the evolution operator for a single time step $\\Delta t$ as:\n$$\nU(\\Delta t) = e^{-i\\hat{H}\\Delta t} \\approx e^{-i\\hat{V}\\Delta t/2} \\, e^{-i\\hat{T}\\Delta t} \\, e^{-i\\hat{V}\\Delta t/2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)\n$$\nThe global error over a finite time interval $T$ is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$. The action of this operator is implemented in three sequential steps for each time increment. Let $\\psi_n = \\psi(x, n\\Delta t)$.\n\n$1$. **First Potential Half-Step:** The wave function is evolved under the potential operator $\\hat{V}$ for a duration of $\\Delta t/2$. In coordinate representation, this is a simple multiplication:\n$$\n\\psi'(x) = e^{-iV(x)\\Delta t/2} \\psi_n(x)\n$$\n\n$2$. **Full Kinetic Step:** The wave function is then evolved under the kinetic operator $\\hat{T}$ for a full time step $\\Delta t$. This operation is most efficiently performed in Fourier (momentum) space. The kinetic operator $\\hat{T} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ becomes a multiplicative operator $\\frac{k_x^2}{2}$ in the space of wave numbers $k_x$. The procedure is:\n   a. Transform $\\psi'(x)$ to Fourier space: $\\tilde{\\psi}'(k_x) = \\mathcal{F}[\\psi'(x)]$.\n   b. Multiply by the kinetic evolution factor: $\\tilde{\\psi}''(k_x) = e^{-i (k_x^2/2) \\Delta t} \\tilde{\\psi}'(k_x)$.\n   c. Transform back to coordinate space: $\\psi''(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\tilde{\\psi}''(k_x)]$.\nHere, $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ denote the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its inverse, respectively.\n\n$3$. **Second Potential Half-Step:** A final evolution under the potential operator for $\\Delta t/2$ completes the time step:\n$$\n\\psi_{n+1}(x) = e^{-iV(x)\\Delta t/2} \\psi''(x)\n$$\n\nThe overall numerical algorithm is as follows:\nFirst, we discretize the spatial domain $x \\in [-L, L)$ using $N$ uniformly spaced points $x_j$ with grid spacing $\\Delta x = 2L/N$. We also define the corresponding grid of wave numbers $k_{x,j}$ required for the FFT.\n\nNext, we evaluate the initial wave function $\\psi(x,0)$ on the spatial grid $x_j$.\n\nThe system is then evolved from $t=0$ to the final time $T$ by repeatedly applying the three-step Strang splitting procedure for a total of $N_t = T/\\Delta t$ time steps.\n\nFinally, we compute the required physical observables. Spatial integrals of a function $f(x)$ are approximated by a discrete sum over the grid points, consistent with the problem specification:\n$$\n\\int_{-L}^{L} f(x)\\,dx \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} f(x_j)\\,\\Delta x\n$$\nThe expectation value of an observable $\\hat{A}$ is computed as:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle_t = \\frac{\\int_{-L}^{L} \\psi^*(x,t) [\\hat{A}\\psi(x,t)] \\,dx}{\\int_{-L}^{L} |\\psi(x,t)|^2\\,dx} \\approx \\frac{\\sum_j (\\psi^* \\hat{A}\\psi)_j}{\\sum_j |\\psi_j|^2}\n$$\nwhere the $\\Delta x$ factors cancel. For position-dependent observables like $x^n$, this simplifies to a weighted average over the probability density $|\\psi(x,t)|^2$.\n\nThe specific quantities for each case are calculated based on these principles using the final wave function $\\psi(x,T)$ and, for Case C, the initial wave function $\\psi(x,0)$.\n\n- **Case A:** $E_A = |\\langle x \\rangle_T - (x_0 + p_0T)|$. $\\langle x \\rangle_T$ is computed from the final state $\\psi(x,T)$.\n- **Case B:** $E_B = |1 - \\mathcal{N}_T|$. The norm $\\mathcal{N}_T = \\int_{-L}^{L} |\\psi(x,T)|^2 dx$ is computed. As the numerical scheme is unitary, this value is expected to be very small, reflecting the conservation of probability.\n- **Case C:** $R_C = \\sigma_x(T)/\\sigma_x(0)$. The standard deviation $\\sigma_x(t) = \\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle_t - \\langle x \\rangle_t^2}$ is computed for both $t=0$ and $t=T$.\n\nThe provided code implements this complete procedure to determine the values $E_A$, $E_B$, and $R_C$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 1D time-dependent Schrödinger equation using the split-step Fourier method\n    for three specified test cases and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Global parameters from the problem statement\n    L_param = 50.0\n    N_param = 2048\n    dt_param = 1e-3\n    x0_param = -8.0\n    sigma_param = 1.0\n    p0_param = 2.0\n\n    # Discretization of the spatial and momentum domains\n    dx = 2 * L_param / N_param\n    x_grid = -L_param + np.arange(N_param) * dx\n    k_grid = 2 * np.pi * np.fft.fftfreq(N_param, d=dx)\n\n    # Initial wave function (normalized Gaussian wave packet)\n    norm_const = (np.pi * sigma_param**2)**(-0.25)\n    phase = 1j * p0_param * (x_grid - x0_param)\n    envelope = -(x_grid - x0_param)**2 / (2 * sigma_param**2)\n    psi0 = norm_const * np.exp(envelope + phase)\n\n    def compute_observables(psi):\n        \"\"\"Computes norm, expectation value of x, and expectation value of x^2.\"\"\"\n        prob_density = np.abs(psi)**2\n        norm_sum = np.sum(prob_density)\n        \n        # Expectation values are ratios, so the dx factor from integration cancels\n        x_exp = np.sum(x_grid * prob_density) / norm_sum\n        x2_exp = np.sum(x_grid**2 * prob_density) / norm_sum\n        \n        # The true norm requires multiplication by dx\n        norm_val = dx * norm_sum\n        \n        return norm_val, x_exp, x2_exp\n\n    def run_simulation(k, T):\n        \"\"\"\n        Runs the split-step simulation for a given potential parameter k and final time T.\n        \"\"\"\n        num_steps = int(round(T / dt_param))\n\n        # Potential V(x) = -k*x^2\n        V = -k * x_grid**2\n        \n        # Pre-compute time evolution operators for efficiency\n        potential_op_half = np.exp(-0.5j * V * dt_param)\n        kinetic_op_full = np.exp(-1.0j * 0.5 * k_grid**2 * dt_param)\n        \n        psi = psi0.copy()\n        \n        for _ in range(num_steps):\n            # Strang splitting a.k.a. symmetric split-step method\n            psi = potential_op_half * psi\n            psi = np.fft.ifft(kinetic_op_full * np.fft.fft(psi))\n            psi = potential_op_half * psi\n            \n        return psi\n\n    # --- Test Case A: Free Propagation ---\n    k_A = 0.0\n    T_A = 1.5\n    psi_A = run_simulation(k_A, T_A)\n    _, x_exp_A, _ = compute_observables(psi_A)\n    x_pred_A = x0_param + p0_param * T_A\n    E_A = np.abs(x_exp_A - x_pred_A)\n\n    # --- Test Case B: Weak Inverted Potential ---\n    k_B = 0.02\n    T_B = 1.0\n    psi_B = run_simulation(k_B, T_B)\n    norm_T_B, _, _ = compute_observables(psi_B)\n    E_B = np.abs(1.0 - norm_T_B)\n\n    # --- Test Case C: Stronger Inverted Potential ---\n    k_C = 0.2\n    T_C = 0.8\n    # Calculate observables at t=0\n    _, x_exp_0, x2_exp_0 = compute_observables(psi0)\n    variance_0 = x2_exp_0 - x_exp_0**2\n    sigma_x_0 = np.sqrt(variance_0)\n    \n    # Run simulation and calculate observables at t=T\n    psi_C = run_simulation(k_C, T_C)\n    _, x_exp_C, x2_exp_C = compute_observables(psi_C)\n    variance_C = x2_exp_C - x_exp_C**2\n    sigma_x_T = np.sqrt(variance_C)\n    \n    R_C = sigma_x_T / sigma_x_0\n    \n    # Collect results and format output\n    results = [E_A, E_B, R_C]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2449888"}]}
