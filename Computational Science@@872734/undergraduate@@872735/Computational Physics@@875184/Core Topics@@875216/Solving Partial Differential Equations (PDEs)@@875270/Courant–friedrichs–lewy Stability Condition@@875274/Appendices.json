Derivation of the Sufficient Stability Condition**\n\nThe problem demands a derivation based on fundamental principles that results in a condition expressible via a local Courant number. We will use the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which originates from an analysis of the domains of dependence.\n\nThe CFL condition states that for a numerical scheme to be stable and convergent, the physical domain of dependence of a point must be contained within the numerical domain of dependence of that point.\n\nLet us analyze the dependencies for a single time step from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1} = t^n + \\Delta t$.\n- **Physical Domain of Dependence**: The solution $u(x_i, t^{n+1})$ of the continuous wave equation depends on the initial data at time $t^n$ within the characteristic cone originating from $(x_i, t^{n+1})$. This corresponds to the spatial interval $[x_i - c\\Delta t, x_i + c\\Delta t]$.\n- **Numerical Domain of Dependence**: The discrete update rule shows that the new value $u_i^{n+1}$ is computed from values at the previous time steps, $u_i^n$, $u_i^{n-1}$, and spatial neighbors at time $t^n$: $u_{i-1}^n$ and $u_{i+1}^n$. Therefore, the numerical domain of dependence for $u_i^{n+1}$ on the data at time $t^n$ is the spatial interval covered by the stencil, which is $[x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}]$.\n\nApplying the CFL principle, we require:\n$$ [x_i - c\\Delta t, x_i + c\\Delta t] \\subseteq [x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}] $$\nThis single inclusion yields two inequalities:\n1.  $x_i - c\\Delta t \\ge x_{i-1} \\implies c\\Delta t \\le x_i - x_{i-1} \\implies c\\Delta t \\le \\Delta x_{i-1}$\n2.  $x_i + c\\Delta t \\le x_{i+1} \\implies c\\Delta t \\le x_{i+1} - x_i \\implies c\\Delta t \\le \\Delta x_i$\n\nThese two conditions must hold for every interior grid point $i$. To ensure stability across the entire computational domain, the time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy the most restrictive of all these local constraints. This leads to a global condition:\n$$ c\\Delta t \\le \\min\\left( \\min_i \\Delta x_{i-1}, \\min_i \\Delta x_i \\right) $$\nSince the set of all spacings $\\{\\Delta x_j\\}_{j=0}^{N-1}$ includes all $\\{\\Delta x_{i-1}\\}$ and $\\{\\Delta x_i\\}$ that appear in the inequalities, the condition simplifies to:\n$$ c\\Delta t \\le \\min_j (\\Delta x_j) $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\min_j (\\Delta x_j)}{c} $$\nThis is a sufficient stability condition for the scheme.\n\n**3. Interpretation in Terms of Local Courant Number**\n\nThe problem defines the local Courant number at cell $i$ as $\\mathcal{C}_i = \\frac{c\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x_i}$. We can express our derived stability condition using this definition.\nFrom $c\\Delta t \\le \\min_j(\\Delta x_j)$, we can write for any cell $k$:\n$$ \\frac{c\\Delta t}{\\Delta x_k} \\le \\frac{\\min_j(\\Delta x_j)}{\\Delta x_k} $$\nThe right-hand side is always less than or equal to $1$, and it equals $1$ when $\\Delta x_k$ is the minimum spacing. Therefore, the maximum Courant number over all cells is bounded by $1$:\n$$ \\max_k \\mathcal{C}_k = \\max_k \\left( \\frac{c\\Delta t}{\\Delta x_k} \\right) = \\frac{c\\Delta t}{\\min_k(\\Delta x_k)} \\le 1 $$\nThus, the stability condition $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\min_j (\\Delta x_j)}{c}$ is equivalent to this inequality on the maximum Courant number. This fulfills the requirement of the problem statement.\n\nThe upper bound for a stable time step, denoted $\\Delta t_\\star$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta t_\\star = \\frac{\\min_j (\\Delta x_j)}{c} $$\nThe maximum stable time step for a chosen Courant factor $\\theta \\in (0,1]$ is:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\max}(\\theta) = \\theta \\, \\Delta t_\\star = \\theta \\frac{\\min_j (\\Delta x_j)}{c} $$\nA proposed time step $\\Delta t_{\\text{prop}}$ is stable if it satisfies the sufficient stability condition, which is $\\Delta t_{\\text{prop}} \\le \\Delta t_\\star$. Note that the safety factor $\\theta$ is used for setting a practical time step, not for checking the fundamental stability of a proposed step.\n\n**4.

The scheme is:\n$$\nu_{i}^{n+1} = u_{i}^{n} - C\\left(u_{i}^{n} - u_{i-1}^{n}\\right)\n$$\nWe expand each term around the point $(x_i, t_n)$:\n$$\nu_{i}^{n+1} = u(x_i, t_n + \\Delta t) = u_i^n + \\Delta t \\, (u_t)_i^n + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2} (u_{tt})_i^n + O((\\Delta t)^3)\n$$\n$$\nu_{i-1}^{n} = u(x_i - \\Delta x, t_n) = u_i^n - \\Delta x \\, (u_x)_i^n + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} (u_{xx})_i^n - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} (u_{xxx})_i^n + O((\\Delta x)^4)\n$$\nSubstituting these expansions into the numerical scheme gives:\n$$\nu_i^n + \\Delta t \\, u_t + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2} u_{tt} + \\dots = u_{i}^{n} - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( u_i^n - \\left( u_i^n - \\Delta x \\, u_x + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} u_{xx} - \\dots \\right) \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling $u_i^n$ and dividing by $\\Delta t$:\n$$\nu_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} u_{tt} + \\dots = - \\frac{a}{\\Delta x} \\left( \\Delta x \\, u_x - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} u_{xx} + \\dots \\right)\n$$\n$$\nu_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} u_{tt} + \\dots = -a u_x + a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} - \\dots\n$$\nRearranging terms to match the original PDE, we get the truncation error:\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} u_{tt} + \\dots\n$$\nThis is the equation that the numerical scheme actually solves, up to higher-order terms. To interpret the error terms, we form the modified equation by replacing time derivatives with spatial derivatives using the original PDE. To leading order, $u_t = -a u_x$. Differentiating with respect to time gives $u_{tt} = \\partial_t(-a u_x) = -a (\\partial_x u_t) = -a \\partial_x(-a u_x) = a^2 u_{xx}$.\nSubstituting $u_{tt} = a^2 u_{xx}$ into the truncation error expression:\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} (a^2 u_{xx}) + \\dots\n$$\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = \\left( a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} - a^2 \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\right) u_{xx} + \\dots\n$$\nFactoring out common terms and using the definition $C = a \\Delta t / \\Delta x$:\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\right) u_{xx} + \\dots\n$$\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (1 - C) u_{xx} + \\text{higher-order terms}\n$$\nThe leading-order error term is a diffusion term, $\\kappa \\, u_{xx}$, where the numerical diffusivity is $\\kappa = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (1 - C)$.\n\nWe now analyze the two cases presented in the problem:\n1.  **Case $C1$**: For a stable run with $0  C  1$, the term $(1 - C)$ is positive. Since $a0$ and $\\Delta x0$, the numerical diffusivity $\\kappa$ is positive. A positive diffusion term has the effect of damping or smoothing the solution, particularly high-frequency components (sharp gradients). This is known as numerical diffusion or numerical viscosity. While this enhances stability, it is an artifact that makes the numerical solution smoother than the true solution.\n\n2.  **Case $C=1$**: When the simulation is run at the stability limit $C=1$, the numerical diffusivity $\\kappa = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (1 - 1) = 0$. The leading-order error term vanishes. In fact, all higher-order error terms in the modified equation for this scheme also vanish at $C=1$. The scheme becomes exact. The update rule simplifies to $u_{i}^{n+1} = u_{i}^{n} - (u_{i}^{n} - u_{i-1}^{n}) = u_{i-1}^{n}$. This means the value at grid point $i$ at the new time is simply the value from the upwind grid point $i-1$ at the old time. This exactly corresponds to information traveling a distance $\\Delta x$ in time $\\Delta t$, which is the physical behavior since $a = \\Delta x / \\Delta t$ when $C=1$.\n\nThe consequence of having zero numerical diffusion at $C=1$ is that the scheme is non-dissipative. Its amplification factor from von Neumann analysis is $|G|=1$ for all wavenumbers. Any high-frequency content in the solution, whether from sharp initial data or from machine round-off error, is not damped. It will persist and propagate indefinitely. This undamped, high-frequency content often appears as grid-scale (node-to-node) oscillations, especially near discontinuities.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **Increased numerical diffusion leading to stronger smoothing of sharp gradients compared to the $C1$ run.**\nThe numerical diffusion is proportional to $(1 - C)$. At $C=1$, the diffusion is zero. For $C1$, the diffusion is positive. Therefore, the $C=1$ run has *less* (zero) numerical diffusion than the $C1$ run, not more.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nB. **Persistent, undamped grid-scale oscillations (e.g., sawtooth-like patterns) driven by round-off or discontinuities, due to the loss of numerical damping at $C=1$.**\nAt $C=1$, the scheme loses its numerical damping (diffusion) mechanism. In contrast, for $C1$, the scheme is dissipative and damps high-frequency oscillations. Consequently, any high-frequency noise introduced by initial conditions or round-off error will persist in the $C=1$ simulation, manifesting as grid-scale oscillations. This artifact is absent (or strongly suppressed) in the $C1$ case due to the presence of numerical damping.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\nC. **Unconditional instability, causing amplitudes to grow without bound over time.**\nThe first-order upwind scheme is conditionally stable for $0 \\le C \\le 1$. The case $C=1$ lies on the boundary of the stability region; it is neutrally stable, not unstable. Amplitudes do not grow. Instability requires $|G|1$, which occurs for $C1$.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nD. **Larger spurious phase lag (dispersion error) than at $C1$, causing waves to advect more slowly than they should.**\nAt $C=1$, the scheme is exact and has zero phase error (zero numerical dispersion). The numerical wave speed is identical to the physical wave speed. For $C1$, the scheme is dispersive and exhibits a phase lag. Thus, the phase error is larger for $C1$, not for $C=1$.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nE. **Unique aliasing of low-frequency modes into high-frequency modes that only occurs at $C=1$ and not at $C1$.**\nAliasing is a consequence of spatial discretization and is not a phenomenon that is uniquely \"activated\" at $C=1$. While the behavior of aliased modes might differ due to the lack of damping at $C=1$, the fundamental cause of undamped oscillations is the loss of dissipation itself, not a special aliasing mechanism. This option misidentifies the primary artifact.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2383698"}]}
