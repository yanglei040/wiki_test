The drag force always opposes the instantaneous velocity. A vertical castle wall of height $H$ is located at horizontal distance $D$ from the launch point. The task is to determine, by first principles and numerical simulation, whether the cannonball clears the wall, defined as the projectile height at horizontal position $x = D$ being greater than or equal to $H$ before the projectile impacts the ground.\n\nYour program must:\n- Start from fundamental physical laws (Newton's second law and kinematics definitions) to formulate the equations of motion for the cannonball with quadratic air resistance under uniform gravity.\n- Implement a time-marching numerical integrator to evolve the system state $(x(t), y(t), v_x(t), v_y(t))$ from $t = 0$ until one of the following conditions occurs:\n    1.

Let $(x(t), y(t))$ denote the projectile position, and $(v_x(t), v_y(t))$ its velocity components, with speed $v(t) = \\sqrt{v_x(t)^2 + v_y(t)^2}$. The mass is $m$, gravity has magnitude $g$ directed downward. The drag force for a sphere in a steady flow at moderate Reynolds number is modeled as quadratic in speed, with magnitude $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho C_d A v(t)^2$ and direction opposite the instantaneous velocity. Here $\\rho$ is the air density, $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, and $A = \\pi r^2$ is the cross-sectional area.\n\nBy Newton's second law,\n$$\nm \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}_g + \\mathbf{F}_d,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{F}_g = (0, - m g)$ and $\\mathbf{F}_d = - \\frac{1}{2} \\rho C_d A \\, v \\, \\mathbf{v}$, because $v \\, \\mathbf{v}$ equals $v^2$ in the direction of $\\mathbf{v}$ and the negative sign enforces opposition to motion.

A robust choice is the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method. For a state vector $\\mathbf{s} = (x, y, v_x, v_y)$ and time step $\\Delta t$, define the right-hand side $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{s}) = (v_x, v_y, a_x, a_y)$, where\n$$\na_x = - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\rho C_d A}{m} v v_x, \\quad a_y = - g - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\rho C_d A}{m} v v_y, \\quad v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}.\n$$\nGiven $\\mathbf{s}_n$ at time $t_n$, RK4 advances to $\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}$ at $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$ via\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k}_1 = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{s}_n), \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_2 = \\mathbf{f}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_n + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\, \\mathbf{k}_1 \\right), \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_3 = \\mathbf{f}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_n + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\, \\mathbf{k}_2 \\right), \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_4 = \\mathbf{f}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_n + \\Delta t \\, \\mathbf{k}_3 \\right), \\\\\n\\mathbf{s}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{s}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6} \\left( \\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4 \\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTermination and event handling:\n- We integrate forward in time until one of three conditions is met: (i) the wall is reached or exceeded horizontally ($x \\ge D$), (ii) the projectile impacts the ground ($y  0$), or (iii) a maximum simulation time $t_{\\max}$ is reached to avoid infinite loops in degenerate cases (e.g., zero horizontal velocity).\n- To evaluate the vertical position at exactly the wall location $x = D$, we perform linear interpolation between the last two integration states that satisfy $x_\\text{prev}  D \\le x_\\text{next}$. Denoting the two bracketing states as $(x_\\text{prev}, y_\\text{prev})$ and $(x_\\text{next}, y_\\text{next})$, with $x_\\text{next} \\ne x_\\text{prev}$, the interpolated wall height is\n$$\ny(D) \\approx y_\\text{prev} + \\frac{D - x_\\text{prev}}{x_\\text{next} - x_\\text{prev}} \\left( y_\\text{next} - y_\\text{prev} \\right).\n$$\n- The wall is cleared if and only if $y(D) \\ge H$ and the projectile has not impacted the ground before reaching $x = D$.\n\nNumerical parameters:\n- We use $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, $\\rho = 1.225\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$ as specified.\n- A fixed time step $\\Delta t$ such as $\\Delta t = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ provides a balance between accuracy and computational cost for the distances and speeds in the test suite.\n- The maximum simulation time $t_{\\max}$ can be set to a sufficiently large value (e.g., $t_{\\max} = 200\\,\\mathrm{s}$) to ensure termination.\n\nCorrectness considerations:\n- The RK4 scheme is fourth-order accurate in $\\Delta t$ for smooth right-hand sides. The drag and gravity forces are smooth functions of the state, so the method is appropriate.\n- Linear interpolation in $x$ is justified for small $\\Delta t$ because the state varies smoothly, and the distance between $x_\\text{prev}$ and $x_\\text{next}$ is small.\n\nApplication to the test suite:\nWe now reason qualitatively about each case; the program performs the exact numerical evaluation and comparison.\n\n1. Case $1$: $m = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $r = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $C_d = 0.47$, $v_0 = 200.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\theta = 45.0^\\circ$, $D = 100.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $H = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Even without drag, the height at $x = D$ is approximately large (on the order of $10^2\\,\\mathrm{m}$), so including drag still leaves $y(D) \\gg H$. The program yields True.\n2. Case $2$: $\\theta = 90.0^\\circ$ implies $v_x(0) = 0$. The projectile moves vertically and never reaches $x = D = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, so it cannot clear the wall. The program yields False.\n3. Case $3$: $D = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$ means we compare the initial height $y(0) = 0$ to $H = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Since $0  1.0$, the wall is not cleared. The program yields False.\n4. Case $4$: $v_0 = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $\\theta = 10.0^\\circ$ in vacuum ($C_d = 0.0$) produce a low, rapidly descending trajectory that impacts the ground before $x$ reaches $D = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$ (as can be verified analytically in the no-drag limit), so the wall is not cleared. The program yields False.\n5. Case $5$: $v_0 = 250.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\theta = 45.0^\\circ$, $D = 300.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $H = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The projectile reaches $x = 300.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$ in approximately a couple of seconds and remains at a substantial altitude despite drag; thus $y(D) \\ge H$. The program yields True.\n\nTherefore, the expected output list of booleans for the five test cases, in order, is:\n[True, False, False, False, True].\n\nThe accompanying program implements the RK4 integrator, event detection, interpolation at $x = D$, and prints exactly the required output format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef simulate_clearance(m, r, Cd, rho, v0, theta_deg, D, H, g=9.81, dt=1e-3, t_max=200.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulate a projectile with quadratic drag and determine if it clears a wall.\n\n    Parameters:\n        m (float): mass [kg]\n        r (float): radius [m]\n        Cd (float): drag coefficient [-]\n        rho (float): air density [kg/m^3]\n        v0 (float): initial speed [m/s]\n        theta_deg (float): launch angle [deg]\n        D (float): wall horizontal distance [m]\n        H (float): wall height [m]\n        g (float): gravitational acceleration [m/s^2]\n        dt (float): time step [s]\n        t_max (float): maximum simulation time [s]\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if clears (y(D) = H before ground impact), else False.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle trivial D == 0 without integrating\n    if D == 0.0:\n        # Launched from y=0, so cannot clear any positive H\n        return 0.0 = H\n\n    # Cross-sectional area of sphere\n    A = np.pi * r * r\n\n    # Initial state\n    theta = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n    vx = v0 * np.cos(theta)\n    vy = v0 * np.sin(theta)\n    x = 0.0\n    y = 0.0\n    t = 0.0\n\n    # Precompute drag factor\n    drag_coeff_factor = 0.5 * rho * Cd * A / m\n\n    # Keep previous state for interpolation\n    prev_x, prev_y = x, y\n\n    # Integration loop using RK4\n    while t  t_max:\n        if x = D:\n            break\n        if y  0.0:\n            # Impacted ground before reaching the wall\n            return False\n\n        # Store current for interpolation after step\n        prev_x, prev_y = x, y\n\n        # Define RHS function\n        def rhs(state):\n            sx, sy, svx, svy = state\n            v = np.hypot(svx, svy)\n            ax = -drag_coeff_factor * v * svx\n            ay = -g - drag_coeff_factor * v * svy\n            return np.array([svx, svy, ax, ay], dtype=float)\n\n        state = np.array([x, y, vx, vy], dtype=float)\n\n        k1 = rhs(state)\n        k2 = rhs(state + 0.5 * dt * k1)\n        k3 = rhs(state + 0.5 * dt * k2)\n        k4 = rhs(state + dt * k3)\n\n        state_next = state + (dt / 6.0) * (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)\n\n        x, y, vx, vy = state_next\n        t += dt\n\n        # Check if we have crossed or reached the wall this step\n        if x = D:\n            dx = x - prev_x\n            if dx == 0.0:\n                # No horizontal progress;

The parameter $\\theta$ is the launch angle, which we must determine.\n\nA direct analytical solution for the trajectory $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ does not exist for this system. We must employ a numerical approach. The problem asks us to find the value(s) of $\\theta$ for which the trajectory passes through the target point $(x_T, y_T)$. This is a boundary value problem. We will solve it using a \"shooting method,\" which transforms the boundary value problem into a root-finding problem.\n\nThe shooting method proceeds as follows:\n1.  We select a trial launch angle $\\theta$. This fully specifies the initial conditions $\\mathbf{S}(0)$.\n2.  We numerically integrate the system of ODEs from $t=0$ forward in time. This process \"shoots\" the projectile.\n3.  We monitor the trajectory to find the time $t^\\star$ at which the projectile's horizontal position $x(t)$ first equals the target's horizontal position $x_T$.\n4.  At this time $t^\\star$, we evaluate the projectile's height, $y(t^\\star)$.\n5.  We define a scalar objective function, $F(\\theta)$, as the difference between the projectile's height at $x=x_T$ and the target height $y_T$:\n    $$\n    F(\\theta) = y\\big(t^\\star(\\theta)\\big) - y_T\n    $$\n    A solution angle $\\theta^\\star$ is one for which $F(\\theta^\\star) = 0$. The problem is therefore reduced to finding the roots of the function $F(\\theta)$.\n\nTo implement this method, we require a robust ODE integrator. The `solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library is an excellent tool for this. A critical feature of `solve_ivp` is its ability to detect \"events\"—conditions where a function of the state and time becomes zero. We will use this feature to precisely determine the crossing time $t^\\star$ without having to integrate to a fixed maximum time and then interpolate.\n\nWe define two terminal event functions:\n1.  `event_reach_x_target(t, S)`: This function returns $x(t) - x_T$. The integrator will stop when this value is zero, indicating the projectile has reached the target's longitude.\n2.  `event_hit_ground(t, S)`: This function returns $y(t)$. We configure it to trigger only when $y(t)$ is decreasing (i.e., the projectile is falling), which signals that the projectile has hit the ground before reaching $x=x_T$.\n\nThe function $F(\\theta)$ is constructed by calling the ODE solver for a given $\\theta$. If the integration is terminated by the `event_reach_x_target` event, we calculate and return $y(t^\\star) - y_T$. If it is terminated by `event_hit_ground`, or if it reaches a maximum simulation time without triggering any event, it means the trajectory falls short. In this case, the function $F(\\theta)$ is considered undefined for the purpose of bracketing, and we can return a non-numerical value like `NaN` (Not a Number) to signify this.\n\nTo find all roots of $F(\\theta)=0$ in the specified interval $\\theta \\in [0.1^\\circ, 89.9^\\circ]$, we employ a two-stage process:\n1.  **Bracketing**: We first discretize the search interval into a fine grid of angles. We evaluate $F(\\theta)$ at each point on this grid. By searching for adjacent grid points $(\\theta_i, \\theta_{i+1})$ where the sign of the function changes (i.e., $F(\\theta_i) \\cdot F(\\theta_{i+1})  0$), we identify sub-intervals that are guaranteed to contain at least one root, according to the Intermediate Value Theorem. It is important to handle the `NaN` cases correctly, as a valid bracket requires defined numerical values at both ends.\n2.  **Solving**: For each bracket $[\\theta_a, \\theta_b]$ found, we apply a numerical root-finding algorithm. Brent's method, implemented in `scipy.optimize.brentq`, is a highly effective choice. It combines the guaranteed convergence of the bisection method with the faster convergence of the secant method, and it is the standard for one-dimensional root-finding when a bracketing interval is known. The tolerance of the root-finder will be set to ensure the required precision on both the angle and the final target height.\n\nThis systematic procedure of numerical integration, event detection, bracketing, and root-solving will be applied to each test case to find all valid launch angles.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the projectile motion problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fixed physical parameters\n    M = 0.145  # mass in kg\n    RHO = 1.225  # air density in kg/m^3\n    C_D = 0.47  # drag coefficient (dimensionless)\n    A = 0.0042  # cross-sectional area in m^2\n    G = 9.81  # gravitational acceleration in m/s^2\n\n    # Derived drag parameter k = (rho * C_d * A) / (2 * m)\n    K = (0.5 * RHO * C_D * A) / M\n\n    # Test suite\n    test_cases = [\n        (40.0, (80.0, 0.0)),   # Case 1\n        (40.0, (60.0, 10.0)),  # Case 2\n        (30.0, (30.0, 0.0)),   # Case 3\n        (40.0, (200.0, 0.0)),  # Case 4\n    ]\n\n    def derivatives(t, state, k, g):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the derivatives for the system of ODEs.\n        state = [x, y, v_x, v_y]\n        \"\"\"\n        x, y, vx, vy = state\n        v = np.sqrt(vx**2 + vy**2)\n        \n        # Avoid division by zero if velocity is zero, though unlikely in this problem.\n        if v == 0:\n            ax = 0\n            ay = -g\n        else:\n            ax = -k * v * vx\n            ay = -g - k * v * vy\n            \n        return [vx, vy, ax, ay]\n\n    def calculate_y_error_at_xT(theta_deg, v0, xT, yT, k_param, g_param):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the error F(theta) = y(t*) - yT for a given launch angle.\n        Returns np.nan if the projectile does not reach xT.\n        \"\"\"\n        theta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n        vx0 = v0 * np.cos(theta_rad)\n        vy0 = v0 * np.sin(theta_rad)\n        \n        initial_state = [0.0, 0.0, vx0, vy0]\n        \n        # Event: projectile reaches the target's x-coordinate\n        def reach_x_target(t, state, k, g):\n            return state[0] - xT\n        reach_x_target.terminal = True\n        reach_x_target.direction = 1 # Trigger only when x is increasing\n\n        # Event: projectile hits the ground (y=0)\n        def hit_ground(t, state, k, g):\n            return state[1]\n        hit_ground.terminal = True\n        hit_ground.direction = -1 # Trigger only when y is decreasing\n\n        t_span = (0, 100) # Max integration time of 100s is sufficient\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=derivatives,\n            t_span=t_span,\n            y0=initial_state,\n            args=(k_param, g_param),\n            events=[reach_x_target, hit_ground],\n            dense_output=True,\n            rtol=1e-8,\n            atol=1e-8\n        )\n\n        # Check which event terminated the integration\n        if sol.status == 1 and sol.t_events[0].size > 0:\n            # The 'reach_x_target' event was triggered\n            y_at_t_star = sol.y_events[0][0][1]\n            return y_at_t_star - yT\n        else:\n            # Projectile hit the ground first or integration timed out\n            return np.nan\n\n    all_results = []\n    for v0, (xT, yT) in test_cases:\n        \n        # Define the function for root finding, which depends on the case parameters\n        objective_func = lambda th: calculate_y_error_at_xT(th, v0, xT, yT, K, G)\n\n        # 1.

The objective function is the horizontal range (in meters) of a projectile launched at ground level at speed $v_0$ and angle $\\theta$ (in degrees) under quadratic air resistance. The equations of motion follow from Newton’s second law and are given by\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \\mathbf{v}, \\quad\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -g \\,\\mathbf{e}_y - \\frac{k}{m}\\,\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\,\\mathbf{v},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r} = (x,y)$ is position in meters, $\\mathbf{v} = (v_x,v_y)$ is velocity in meters per second, $m$ is mass in kilograms, $g$ is gravitational acceleration in meters per second squared, $k$ is the quadratic drag coefficient in kilograms per meter, and $\\mathbf{e}_y$ is the unit vector in the vertical direction.

All parameters, methods, and conditions are specified with sufficient clarity and are scientifically sound. The problem requires the implementation of a numerical simulation coupled with an optimization algorithm, which is a standard procedure in science and engineering. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is to find the launch angle $\\theta$ that maximizes the horizontal range $R(\\theta)$ of a projectile subject to quadratic air resistance. Since the function $R(\\theta)$ is not available in closed form, we must construct it numerically. This process involves two main components: first, a numerical integrator to solve the equations of motion, and second, an optimization algorithm to find the maximum of the resulting function.\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The state of the projectile at any time $t$ is described by its position $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}(t) = (v_x(t), v_y(t))$. We can define a state vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ y(t) \\\\ v_x(t) \\\\ v_y(t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe governing equations given are $\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \\mathbf{v}$ and $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -g\\mathbf{e}_y - \\frac{k}{m}\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\mathbf{v}$. We can write this as a system of four first-order ODEs, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = f(t, \\mathbf{y})$:\n$$\nf(t, \\mathbf{y}) = \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m} \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} \\cdot v_x \\\\ -g - \\frac{k}{m} \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} \\cdot v_y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe initial conditions at $t=0$ for a given launch speed $v_0$ and angle $\\theta$ are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ v_0 \\cos(\\theta_{rad}) \\\\ v_0 \\sin(\\theta_{rad}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNote that the angle $\\theta$ is given in degrees and must be converted to radians ($\\theta_{rad}$) for use in trigonometric functions.\n\nTo solve this system, we employ the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. Given the state $\\mathbf{y}_n$ at time $t_n$, the state $\\mathbf{y}_{n+1}$ at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$ is approximated by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6} (\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4)\n$$\nwhere the intermediate vector slopes are:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k}_1 = f(t_n, \\mathbf{y}_n) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_2 = f(t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\mathbf{k}_1) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_3 = f(t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\mathbf{k}_2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_4 = f(t_n + \\Delta t, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\Delta t\\mathbf{k}_3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe perform this integration step-by-step with a fixed time step $\\Delta t = 0.005$ seconds, starting from $\\mathbf{y}(0)$. The simulation for a given $\\theta$ terminates when the projectile hits the ground. This is detected when the vertical position $y(t)$ becomes negative. Let $\\mathbf{y}_{n-1}$ be the last state with $y_{n-1} \\ge 0$ and $\\mathbf{y}_{n}$ be the first state with $y_{n}  0$. The horizontal range $R(\\theta)$ is the interpolated value of the $x$-coordinate at the moment $y(t)=0$. Using linear interpolation between $(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})$ and $(x_n, y_n)$, we find the range:\n$$\nR(\\theta) = x_{n-1} - y_{n-1} \\frac{x_n - x_{n-1}}{y_n - y_{n-1}}\n$$\nThis procedure defines our objective function, $R(\\theta)$, which we must maximize.\n\nThe optimization is performed using the golden-section search algorithm, which is suitable for maximizing a unimodal function on a closed interval without requiring derivatives. The search interval is $[\\underline{\\theta}, \\overline{\\theta}] = [0.1^\\circ, 89.9^\\circ]$. Let the interval at a given iteration be $[a, b]$. We compute two interior points, $c$ and $d$:\n$$\nc = b - \\varphi(b - a)\n$$\n$$\nd = a + \\varphi(b - a)\n$$\nwhere $\\varphi = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$ is the golden ratio conjugate. We then evaluate the objective function at these points, $R(c)$ and $R(d)$.\n- If $R(c) > R(d)$, the maximum must lie in the interval $[a, d]$. We update our search interval by setting $b=d$.\n- If $R(d) \\ge R(c)$, the maximum must lie in the interval $[c, b]$. We update our search interval by setting $a=c$.\nThis process is repeated, shrinking the interval width by a factor of $\\varphi$ at each step. The algorithm terminates when the interval width $(b-a)$ is less than or equal to the tolerance $\\varepsilon_\\theta = 10^{-5}$ degrees, or after a maximum of $N_{\\max} = 64$ iterations. The optimal angle, $\\theta^\\star$, is then reported as the midpoint of the final interval, $\\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n\nThe overall procedure is as follows:\n1.  Implement the function $f(t, \\mathbf{y})$ representing the ODE system.\n2.  Implement the RK4 integration step.\n3.  Implement the objective function $R(\\theta)$ which, for a given angle $\\theta$, simulates the trajectory using RK4, detects ground impact, and returns the interpolated range.\n4.  Implement the golden-section search algorithm to find the angle $\\theta^\\star \\in [0.1, 89.9]$ that maximizes $R(\\theta)$.\n5.  Apply this procedure to each of the three test cases provided.\nThe baseline case (Case A with $k=0$) serves as a crucial validation point. In the absence of air resistance, the range is given by $R(\\theta) = (v_0^2/g) \\sin(2\\theta)$, which is maximized at $\\theta = 45^\\circ$.
