The program must accept no input and must hard-code a test suite of parameter triples $(a,b,n)$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers specifying the integration limits and $n$ is a positive integer specifying the number of subintervals.

The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. We shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe volume $V$ of a solid generated by revolving a curve defined by a function $y = g(x)$ about the $x$-axis over the interval $[a, b]$ is given by the definite integral:\n$$ V = \\int_a^b \\pi [g(x)]^2 \\, dx $$\nIn this problem, the function is specified as $g(x) = e^{-x^2}$. Substituting this into the volume formula, we obtain the integral to be evaluated:\n$$ V = \\int_a^b \\pi (e^{-x^2})^2 \\, dx = \\int_a^b \\pi e^{-2x^2} \\, dx $$\nThis integral does not possess a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. Therefore, a numerical approximation is necessary, as stipulated. The problem requires the use of the composite Simpson's $3/8$ rule.\n\nLet the integrand be denoted as $f(x) = \\pi e^{-2x^2}$. We are tasked with approximating the integral $I = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx$.\nThe composite Simpson's $3/8$ rule is derived by dividing the integration interval $[a, b]$ into $n$ subintervals of equal width, where $n$ must be a positive integer multiple of $3$. The width of each subinterval is $h = \\frac{b-a}{n}$. The interval is partitioned by points $x_i = a + i h$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$.\n\nThe composite rule is formed by summing the basic Simpson's $3/8$ rule over consecutive groups of three subintervals. The basic rule over an interval $[x_k, x_{k+3}]$ is:\n$$ \\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+3}} f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\frac{3h}{8} [f(x_k) + 3f(x_{k+1}) + 3f(x_{k+2}) + f(x_{k+3})] $$\nSumming these approximations over the entire range of integration from $i=0$ to $n/3-1$ for groups of three subintervals $[x_{3i}, x_{3i+3}]$, we obtain the composite formula:\n$$ I = \\sum_{i=0}^{(n/3) - 1} \\int_{x_{3i}}^{x_{3i+3}} f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{(n/3) - 1} \\frac{3h}{8} [f(x_{3i}) + 3f(x_{3i+1}) + 3f(x_{3i+2}) + f(x_{3i+3})] $$\nExpanding and collecting terms for the entire sum gives the general formula for the composite Simpson's $3/8$ rule:\n$$ I \\approx \\frac{3h}{8} \\left[ f(x_0) + 3f(x_1) + 3f(x_2) + 2f(x_3) + 3f(x_4) + \\ldots + 3f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n) \\right] $$\nThe pattern of coefficients is $\\{1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, \\ldots, 2, 3, 3, 1\\}$. More formally, the integral approximation $I_S$ is:\n$$ I_S = \\frac{3h}{8} \\left( f(x_0) + f(x_n) + 2 \\sum_{j=1}^{n/3 - 1} f(x_{3j}) + 3 \\sum_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}, i \\pmod 3 \\neq 0} f(x_i) \\right) $$\nAn efficient algorithmic formulation for the sum within the brackets is:\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_i f(x_i) $$\nwhere the weights $w_i$ are defined as:\n$$ w_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } i=0 \\text{ or } i=n \\\\ 2 & \\text{if } i \\pmod 3 = 0 \\text{ and } 0 < i < n \\\\ 3 & \\text{if } i \\pmod 3 \\neq 0 \\text{ and } 0 < i < n \\end{cases} $$\nThe final approximation for the volume is then $V \\approx \\frac{3h}{8} S$.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is as follows:\n1.  For each test case $(a, b, n)$, calculate the step size $h = \\frac{b-a}{n}$. Note that if $a = b$, then $h = 0$, which correctly yields a volume of $V=0$.\n2.  Generate the set of $n+1$ points $x_i$ from $a$ to $b$ inclusive, i.e., $x_i = a + i h$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n3.  Define the integrand function $f(x) = \\pi e^{-2x^2}$.\n4.  Evaluate $f(x_i)$ for all points $x_i$.\n5.  Compute the weighted sum $S = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_i f(x_i)$ using the coefficients $w_i$ as defined above.\n6.  Calculate the final volume estimate $V = \\frac{3h}{8} S$.\nThis procedure will be applied to each of the provided test cases. The implementation will use vector operations for computational efficiency and to reduce the likelihood of indexing errors. An array of points $x$ is generated, the function $f$ is applied element-wise, an array of weights $w$ is constructed according to the rule, and the result is computed via a dot product of the weights and function values, scaled by the factor $\\frac{3h}{8}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the volume of a solid of revolution using Simpson's 3/8 rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem specifies the function y = exp(-x^2) is rotated about the x-axis.\n    # The volume is given by the integral of pi * y^2.\n    # The integrand is therefore f(x) = pi * exp(-2*x^2).\n    integrand = lambda x: np.pi * np.exp(-2 * x**2)\n\n    # The test suite is given as a list of triples (a, b, n).\n    # a, b are integration limits, and n is the number of subintervals.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.0, 1.0, 300),\n        (0.0, 1.0, 3),\n        (-1.0, 1.0, 300),\n        (0.0, 1.0e-3, 3),\n        (0.5, 0.5, 3),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each test case.\n    for a, b, n in test_cases:\n        # The composite Simpson's 3/8 rule requires n to be a multiple of 3.\n        # This is satisfied by all test cases.\n\n        # Calculate the width of each subinterval.\n        # If a=b, h will be 0, correctly yielding a volume of 0 after multiplication.\n        h = (b - a) / n\n\n        # Generate the n+1 evaluation points for the interval [a, b].\n        x_points = np.linspace(a, b, n + 1)\n\n        # Evaluate the integrand at these points.\n        y_values = integrand(x_points)\n\n        # Construct the weight coefficients for Simpson's 3/8 rule.\n        # The pattern of weights is {1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, ..., 2, 3, 3, 1}.\n        weights = np.full(n + 1, 3.0)\n        weights[0] = 1.0\n        weights[-1] = 1.0\n        # For interior points with an index divisible by 3, the weight is 2.\n        # Slicing `weights[3:-1:3]` correctly targets these points for n > 3.\n        # For n=3, the slice is empty, so no change is made, which is correct.\n        weights[3:-1:3] = 2.0\n\n        # Compute the integral approximation by taking the dot product of weights\n        # and function values, then scaling by the rule's constant factor.\n        integral_approximation = (3 * h / 8) * np.dot(weights, y_values)\n        \n        results.append(integral_approximation)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The format specifier \"{:.12e}\" ensures scientific notation with 12 digits\n    # after the decimal point.\n    output_string = \",\".join([f\"{res:.12e}\" for res in results])\n    print(f\"[{output_string}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2418036"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond fixed-step methods, this practice guides you in developing a more powerful and efficient tool: an adaptive quadrature algorithm.

It presents a well-defined task in computational physics: to implement and analyze an adaptive quadrature algorithm based on Simpson's rule. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of numerical integration and error analysis, is self-contained, and provides a clear and objective set of requirements and test cases.\n\nThe objective is to approximate the definite integral $I = \\int_a^b f(x) dx$ to within a specified absolute error tolerance $\\varepsilon$. The method to be employed is an adaptive quadrature based on the three-node closed Newton–Cotes formula, commonly known as Simpson's rule.\n\nFirst, we establish the base quadrature rule. Simpson's rule approximates the integrand $f(x)$ with a quadratic polynomial that interpolates $f(x)$ at three equally spaced points: the endpoints $a$ and $b$, and the midpoint $c = (a+b)/2$. The integral of this polynomial provides an approximation to the integral of $f(x)$. The formula for a single interval $[a, b]$ is given by:\n$$ S(a,b) = \\frac{b-a}{6}\\left[f(a) + 4f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) + f(b)\\right] $$\nThe error of this approximation, $E = I - S(a,b)$, can be shown via Taylor series expansion to be:\n$$ E(a,b) = -\\frac{(b-a)^5}{2880} f^{(4)}(\\xi) $$\nfor some $\\xi \\in (a,b)$. This shows that Simpson's rule is exact for polynomials of degree up to $3$, as for such polynomials the fourth derivative $f^{(4)}(x)$ is identically zero.\n\nAn adaptive strategy is required to achieve a global error tolerance $\\varepsilon$ efficiently. This involves subdividing the interval $[a,b]$ into smaller subintervals where the function $f(x)$ changes more rapidly, and using larger subintervals where it is smoother. The core of the adaptive algorithm lies in a robust local error estimate.\n\nTo derive this estimate, we compare two approximations for the integral over $[a,b]$. The first is the coarse approximation $S_1$, obtained by applying Simpson's rule once over the entire interval:\n$$ S_1 = S(a,b) $$\nThe second is a more refined approximation, $S_2$, obtained by bisecting the interval at $c=(a+b)/2$ and summing the results of Simpson's rule applied to each subinterval, $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$:\n$$ S_2 = S(a,c) + S(c,b) $$\nLet $I$ be the true value of the integral over $[a,b]$. The errors for $S_1$ and $S_2$ are $E_1 = I - S_1$ and $E_2 = I - S_2$, respectively. If we assume that the fourth derivative $f^{(4)}(x)$ is approximately constant over the interval $[a,b]$, we can relate these two errors. The length of the subintervals for $S_2$ is half that of $S_1$. The error of Simpson's rule is proportional to the fifth power of the interval length, so the error of $S_2$ is approximately $2 \\times (1/2)^5 = 1/16$ of the error of $S_1$.\n$$ E_2 \\approx \\frac{1}{16} E_1 $$\nWe can now estimate the error using the computable quantities $S_1$ and $S_2$:\n$$ I \\approx S_1 + E_1 \\approx S_1 + 16 E_2 $$\n$$ I \\approx S_2 + E_2 $$\nEquating these expressions for $I$ yields $S_1 + 16 E_2 \\approx S_2 + E_2$, which simplifies to:\n$$ 15 E_2 \\approx S_2 - S_1 $$\nThis provides a practical estimate for the error of the more accurate approximation, $S_2$:\n$$ |E_2| = |I - S_2| \\approx \\frac{|S_2 - S_1|}{15} $$\n\nThe recursive algorithm proceeds as follows. A function is defined to compute the integral over an interval $[a,b]$ with a local tolerance $\\text{tol}$.\n1.  Given the interval $[a,b]$ and pre-computed function values $f(a)$, $f(b)$, and $f(c)$ where $c=(a+b)/2$, calculate the coarse approximation $S_1$ and the refined approximation $S_2$. This requires two new function evaluations at the midpoints of $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$. To avoid redundant work, all computed function values are passed down during recursion.\n2.  Calculate the error estimate, $E_{\\text{est}} = |S_2 - S_1|/15$.\n3.  Compare the error estimate to the local tolerance, $\\text{tol}$. If $E_{\\text{est}} \\le \\text{tol}$, the approximation $S_2$ is deemed sufficiently accurate for this interval. The value $S_2$ (which is more accurate than $S_1$) is returned, and the recursion on this branch terminates.\n4.  If $E_{\\text{est}} > \\text{tol}$, the interval must be refined. The algorithm calls itself recursively for the two subintervals, $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$. The tolerance is split between the two recursive calls, typically by assigning each a tolerance of $\\text{tol}/2$. This ensures that the sum of the errors from the subproblems remains bounded by the parent's tolerance.\n5.  The results from the two recursive calls are summed to produce the integral over the original interval $[a,b]$.\n6.  The recursion depth is tracked. The initial call is at depth $0$. Each recursive call increments the depth by $1$. The function must return not only the integral approximation but also the maximum depth reached in its branch of the computation. The final maximum depth is the maximum over all branches.\n7.  A hard limit on recursion depth is imposed to prevent stack overflow for pathological integrands. If this limit is reached, the current best approximation ($S_2$) is returned.\n\nThis process guarantees that the total absolute error over the entire integration domain $[a,b]$ is controlled to be less than the initial user-specified tolerance $\\varepsilon$, while automatically adapting the computational effort to the local behavior of the function.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\n# It's good practice to set a higher recursion limit for such problems,\n# though the max_depth parameter in the function should prevent infinite recursion.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\ndef adaptive_quadrature(f, a, b, tol, max_depth=50):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the definite integral of f from a to b using a recursive\n    adaptive Simpson's rule.\n\n    Args:\n        f (callable): The function to integrate.\n        a (float): The lower limit of integration.\n        b (float): The upper limit of integration.\n        tol (float): The desired absolute error tolerance.\n        max_depth (int): The maximum recursion depth.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[float, int]: A tuple containing the approximate integral and\n                           the maximum recursion depth reached.\n    \"\"\"\n    c = (a + b) / 2.0\n    fa = f(a)\n    fb = f(b)\n    fc = f(c)\n    integral, max_d = _adaptive_simpson_recursive(f, a, b, tol, 0, max_depth, fa, fb, fc)\n    return integral, max_d\n\ndef _adaptive_simpson_recursive(f, a, b, tol, depth, max_depth, fa, fb, fc):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursive helper for adaptive Simpson's rule.\n    It reuses pre-computed function values fa=f(a), fb=f(b), fc=f((a+b)/2).\n    \"\"\"\n    h = b - a\n    c = (a + b) / 2.0\n    \n    # Coarse approximation S1 = S(a,b)\n    s1 = (h / 6.0) * (fa + 4.0 * fc + fb)\n\n    # Refined approximation S2 = S(a,c) + S(c,b)\n    d = (a + c) / 2.0\n    e = (c + b) / 2.0\n    fd = f(d)\n    fe = f(e)\n    \n    s_left = (h / 12.0) * (fa + 4.0 * fd + fc)\n    s_right = (h / 12.0) * (fc + 4.0 * fe + fb)\n    s2 = s_left + s_right\n\n    error_estimate = abs(s2 - s1) / 15.0\n\n    if depth >= max_depth:\n        # Depth limit reached, return best current estimate S2\n        return s2, depth\n\n    if error_estimate = tol:\n        # Tolerance met, return S2 + error correction term for better accuracy\n        return s2 + (s2 - s1) / 15.0, depth\n\n    # Tolerance not met, recurse\n    next_depth = depth + 1\n    tol_sub = tol / 2.0\n    \n    left_integral, left_depth = _adaptive_simpson_recursive(f, a, c, tol_sub, next_depth, max_depth, fa, fc, fd)\n    right_integral, right_depth = _adaptive_simpson_recursive(f, c, b, tol_sub, next_depth, max_depth, fc, fb, fe)\n    \n    integral_sum = left_integral + right_integral\n    max_d = max(left_depth, right_depth)\n    \n    return integral_sum, max_d\n\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs the adaptive quadrature algorithm on the defined test suite\n    and prints the results in the required format.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define test case functions\n    f1 = lambda x: np.sin(x)\n    f2 = lambda x: np.exp(-x**2)\n    f3 = lambda x: 1.0 / (1.0 + 25.0 * x**2)\n    f4 = lambda x: x**8 - x**4 + 1.0\n    f5 = lambda x: np.cos(x)\n    f6 = lambda x: np.exp(-100.0 * (x - 0.3)**2)\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        (f1, 0.0, np.pi, 1e-10),\n        (f2, 0.0, 1.0, 1e-8),\n        (f3, -1.0, 1.0, 1e-8),\n        (f4, 0.0, 1.0, 1e-12),\n        (f5, 0.0, 1e-6, 1e-14),\n        (f6, 0.0, 1.0, 1e-8),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        f, a, b, tol = case\n        # Set a sufficiently large max_depth for the tests\n        integral, max_depth = adaptive_quadrature(f, a, b, tol, max_depth=100)\n        results.append([integral, max_depth])\n\n    # Format the results into the required string format \"[[I1,d1],[I2,d2],...]\"\n    formatted_results = [f\"[{i},{d}]\" for i, d in results]\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2417964"}, {"introduction": "Many integrals in physics involve functions that become infinite at the boundaries of the integration domain.

It requires the implementation and application of the composite midpoint quadrature rule to approximate definite integrals, including several cases involving improper integrals with algebraic singularities at the endpoints.\n\nThe quadrature rule to be implemented is the composite midpoint rule, a degree-$0$ open Newton–Cotes formula. For a given integrable function $f(x)$ on an interval $[a,b]$ and $N$ subintervals, the approximation $Q_N[f;[a,b]]$ is defined as:\n$$\nQ_N[f;[a,b]] \\equiv h \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f\\!\\left(x_k\\right),\n$$\nwhere the step size is $h = \\frac{b-a}{N}$ and the evaluation points $x_k$ are the midpoints of the subintervals, given by:\n$$\nx_k = a + \\left(k+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)h, \\quad \\text{for} \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}.\n$$\nThe core task is to compute the absolute error $E = \\lvert Q_N[f;[a,b]] - I \\rvert$, where $I$ is the provided exact analytical value of the integral $\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx$.\n\nA critical feature of the problem is the presence of integrands with endpoint singularities, such as $f(x) = x^{-1/2}$ on $[0,1]$ or $f(x) = x^{-1/2}(1-x)^{-1/2}$ on $[0,1]$. These functions are non-finite at one or both endpoints. The composite midpoint rule is an *open* quadrature formula, meaning it does not evaluate the integrand at the interval endpoints $a$ and $b$. The set of evaluation points $\\{x_k\\}$ is strictly contained within the open interval $(a,b)$. The first point is $x_0 = a + \\frac{h}{2}$ and the last point is $x_{N-1} = b - \\frac{h}{2}$. This property is fundamentally important, as it ensures that the algorithm never attempts to evaluate the function at a singularity, thereby avoiding division-by-zero errors and other fatal computational issues. The method is thus well-suited for numerically approximating this class of improper integrals, provided they are convergent. All integrals specified in the test suite are indeed convergent.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n$1$. A reusable function is constructed to compute the quadrature $Q_N[f;[a,b]]$. This function takes the integrand $f$, the interval limits $a$ and $b$, and the number of subintervals $N$ as input.\n$2$. The step size $h$ is calculated as $(b-a)/N$. For numerical stability, all calculations are performed using double-precision floating-point arithmetic (`float64` in `numpy`).\n$3$. A vector of the $N$ evaluation points $x_k$ is generated. Using vectorized operations, such as those provided by the `numpy` library, is highly efficient for this task. The points are generated by the formula $a + (\\text{np.arange}(N) + 0.5) \\cdot h$.\n$4$. The integrand $f$ is evaluated at this vector of points to produce a vector of function values, $f(x_k)$.\n$5$. The sum of these values is computed and multiplied by $h$ to yield the final approximation $Q_N$.\n$6$. This process is iterated for each of the eight test cases defined in the problem statement. For each case, the corresponding integrand (represented as a `lambda` function), interval, number of subintervals, and exact integral value are used.\n$7$. The absolute error $E$ is calculated for each case by taking the absolute difference between the numerical approximation $Q_N$ and the given exact value $I$.\n$8$. The resulting list of absolute errors is then formatted into a single string. Each error value is represented in scientific notation with $12$ significant digits of precision, as required.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes composite midpoint quadrature approximations for integrals\n    and calculates the absolute error against known analytic values.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def midpoint_quadrature(f, a, b, N):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the composite midpoint rule approximation for the integral of f from a to b.\n\n        Args:\n            f (callable): The integrand function.\n            a (float): The lower limit of integration.\n            b (float): The upper limit of integration.\n            N (int): The number of subintervals.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The numerical approximation of the integral.\n        \"\"\"\n        if N = 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Number of subintervals N must be positive.\")\n        \n        h = (b - a) / N\n        \n        # Generate the sequence of k values: 0, 1, ..., N-1\n        k = np.arange(N, dtype=np.float64)\n        \n        # Calculate the midpoints of the N subintervals\n        x_k = a + (k + 0.5) * h\n        \n        # Evaluate the function at all midpoints in a vectorized manner\n        f_values = f(x_k)\n        \n        # Compute the sum and multiply by the subinterval width h\n        approximation = h * np.sum(f_values)\n        \n        return approximation\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains: (integrand_lambda, a, b, N, exact_I)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: boundary minimal resolution\n        (lambda x: x**(-0.5), 0.0, 1.0, 1, 2.0),\n        # Case 2: increased resolution\n        (lambda x: x**(-0.5), 0.0, 1.0, 8, 2.0),\n        # Case 3: large N on one-endpoint singularity\n        (lambda x: x**(-0.5), 0.0, 1.0, 1024, 2.0),\n        # Case 4: singularity at the right endpoint\n        (lambda x: (1.0 - x)**(-0.5), 0.0, 1.0, 64, 2.0),\n        # Case 5: singularities at both endpoints\n        (lambda x: x**(-0.5) * (1.0 - x)**(-0.5), 0.0, 1.0, 1024, np.pi),\n        # Case 6: strong but integrable left-endpoint singularity\n        (lambda x: x**(-0.9), 0.0, 1.0, 1000, 10.0),\n        # Case 7: smooth baseline, angles in radians\n        (lambda x: np.sin(x), 0.0, np.pi, 100, 2.0),\n        # Case 8: very short interval near a singular endpoint\n        (lambda x: x**(-0.5), 0.0, 1e-6, 4, 2.0 * np.sqrt(1e-6)),\n    ]\n\n    absolute_errors = []\n    for f_integrand, a_val, b_val, N_val, I_exact in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the numerical approximation Q_N\n        Q_N = midpoint_quadrature(f_integrand, a_val, b_val, N_val)\n        \n        # Compute the absolute error\n        error = np.abs(Q_N - I_exact)\n        absolute_errors.append(error)\n\n    # Format the results into the required output string.\n    # The format specifier '.11e' provides 12 significant digits.\n    # (1 digit before the decimal + 11 digits after).\n    formatted_errors = [f\"{err:.11e}\" for err in absolute_errors]\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_errors)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2418007"}]}
