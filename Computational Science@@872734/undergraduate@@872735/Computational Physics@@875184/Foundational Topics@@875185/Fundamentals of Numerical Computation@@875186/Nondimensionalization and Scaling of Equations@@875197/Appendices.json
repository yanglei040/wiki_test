The provided numerical values for rock density, surface gravity, and compressive strength are physically realistic for a terrestrial planet like Earth. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires an estimate for the maximum height of a mountain, $H_{\\max}$, based on fundamental physical principles. The limiting factor is the compressive strength of the rock at the mountain's base. The mountain can stand only if the pressure exerted by its own weight at the base does not exceed the rock's compressive failure strength, $\\sigma_{c}$.\n\nWe consider a simplified model of a \"very wide mountain\". This allows us to approximate the stress at the base by calculating the lithostatic pressure, which is the pressure exerted by a column of rock of height $H$.\n\nConsider a vertical column of rock with a constant cross-sectional area $A$ and height $H$.\nThe volume of this column is $V = A \\times H$.\nThe mass of the column, $m$, is the product of its volume and the constant density $\\rho$:\n$$m = \\rho V = \\rho A H$$\nThe weight of the column, $W$, which is the gravitational force acting on its mass, is given by:\n$$W = m g = (\\rho A H) g = \\rho g A H$$\nThe stress, $\\sigma$, at the base of this column is defined as the force per unit area. This stress is the weight of the column distributed over its base area $A$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{W}{A} = \\frac{\\rho g A H}{A} = \\rho g H$$\nThis expression represents the lithostatic stress at a depth $H$ beneath a flat surface of uniform material. This is the leading-order estimate the problem asks for.\n\nThe maximum sustainable height, $H_{\\max}$, is reached when this basal stress equals the compressive failure strength of the rock, $\\sigma_{c}$. If the height were any greater, the rock at the base would fail under the immense pressure.\nTherefore, we set the stress $\\sigma$ equal to $\\sigma_{c}$:\n$$\\sigma_{c} = \\rho g H_{\\max}$$\nSolving for $H_{\\max}$, we obtain the analytical expression for the maximum mountain height:\n$$H_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\rho g}$$\nTo verify the dimensional consistency of this result, we analyze the dimensions of the quantities involved, using $M$ for mass, $L$ for length, and $T$ for time.\nThe dimension of stress (pressure) is force per area: $[\\sigma_{c}] = \\frac{[F]}{[L^2]} = \\frac{M L T^{-2}}{L^2} = M L^{-1} T^{-2}$.\nThe dimension of density is mass per volume: $[\\rho] = M L^{-3}$.\nThe dimension of acceleration is length per time squared: $[g] = L T^{-2}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $H_{\\max}$:\n$$[H_{\\max}] = \\frac{[\\sigma_{c}]}{[\\rho][g]} = \\frac{M L^{-1} T^{-2}}{(M L^{-3})(L T^{-2})} = \\frac{M L^{-1} T^{-2}}{M L^{-2} T^{-2}} = L$$\nThe resulting dimension is length, which confirms that the derived expression for $H_{\\max}$ is dimensionally correct.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values to find a quantitative estimate.\nGiven:\n- $\\sigma_{c} = 2.00 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 2.00 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}$\n- $\\rho = 2.70 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n\nPlugging these values into our formula:\n$$H_{\\max} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}}{(2.70 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}})}$$\n$$H_{\\max} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{8}}{2.70 \\times 9.81 \\times 10^{3}}\\ \\mathrm{m} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{5}}{26.487}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$H_{\\max} \\approx 0.0755087 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 7550.87\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed in kilometers ($\\mathrm{km}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$1\\ \\mathrm{km} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$H_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{7550.87}{1000}\\ \\mathrm{km} \\approx 7.55087\\ \\mathrm{km}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$H_{\\max} \\approx 7.55\\ \\mathrm{km}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.55}$$", "id": "2418343"}, {"introduction": "From the static limits of mountains, we now turn to the dramatic dynamics of a supernova explosion. Modeling the expansion of a blast wave from first principles involves solving a complex set of nonlinear partial differential equations. However, this classic problem demonstrates how dimensional analysis can reveal the fundamental scaling law governing the system's evolution [@problem_id:2418412]. By identifying the essential physical parameters—the explosion energy ($E$), the ambient medium's density ($\\rho$), and time ($t$)—you can deduce how the shock wave's radius must grow. This practice is a beautiful illustration of finding a \"self-similar\" solution, a concept where the system's spatial profile looks the same at all times if properly rescaled, revealing a deep universality in the physics of explosions.", "problem": "A supernova explosion can be idealized as an instantaneous deposition of total energy $E$ at a point in a uniform, cold interstellar medium of constant mass density $\\rho$.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in physics that can be solved using the specified methods. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the scaling of the shock radius $R(t)$ with time $t$ following a point explosion in a uniform medium. The physical parameters governing the evolution of the blast wave are explicitly stated to be the deposited energy $E$, the ambient medium density $\\rho$, and the time $t$ elapsed since the explosion. The radius $R$ is thus a function of these three quantities: $R = f(E, \\rho, t)$.\n\nThe argument that $R$ depends only on $E$, $\\rho$, and $t$ rests on the \"strong shock\" assumption. In a strong shock, the shock-front velocity is much greater than the sound speed in the ambient medium. Consequently, the internal energy and pressure of the unshocked medium are negligible compared to the kinetic and thermal energy behind the shock. The only property of the ambient medium that is relevant is its inertia, which is represented by its mass density $\\rho$. The explosion itself is characterized by its total energy $E$, which is conserved. The evolution of this system unfolds in time $t$. Therefore, no other parameters from classical mechanics, such as the gravitational constant $G$ or the ambient pressure $p_0$, are relevant under the stated assumptions.\n\nWe proceed with dimensional analysis to determine the functional form of the relationship. Let us denote the fundamental dimensions of mass, length, and time as $M$, $L$, and $T$, respectively. The dimensions of the relevant physical quantities are:\n- Radius $R$: $[R] = L$\n- Energy $E$: $[E] = \\frac{M L^2}{T^2}$\n- Density $\\rho$: $[\\rho] = \\frac{M}{L^3}$\n- Time $t$: $[t] = T$\n\nWe seek a relationship of the form:\n$$\nR(t) = \\kappa E^a \\rho^b t^c\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are rational exponents to be determined. For this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the dimensions on both sides must be identical.\n\nSubstituting the dimensions of each quantity into the equation, we get:\n$$\n[R] = [E]^a [\\rho]^b [t]^c\n$$\n$$\nL^1 M^0 T^0 = \\left(\\frac{M L^2}{T^2}\\right)^a \\left(\\frac{M}{L^3}\\right)^b (T)^c\n$$\n$$\nL^1 M^0 T^0 = M^a L^{2a} T^{-2a} M^b L^{-3b} T^c\n$$\n\nGrouping the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n$$\nL^1 M^0 T^0 = M^{a+b} L^{2a-3b} T^{-2a+c}\n$$\n\nFor this equality to hold, the exponents of $M$, $L$, and $T$ must match on both sides. This yields a system of three linear equations for the three unknowns $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n1. For mass ($M$): $a + b = 0$\n2. For length ($L$): $2a - 3b = 1$\n3. For time ($T$): $-2a + c = 0$\n\nWe solve this system. From equation (1), we have $b = -a$.\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n$$\n2a - 3(-a) = 1\n$$\n$$\n2a + 3a = 1\n$$\n$$\n5a = 1\n$$\n$$\na = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\n\nNow we can find $b$ and $c$:\n$$\nb = -a = -\\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nFrom equation (3), we have $c = 2a$:\n$$\nc = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\frac{2}{5}\n$$\n\nThe exponents are $a = \\frac{1}{5}$, $b = -\\frac{1}{5}$, and $c = \\frac{2}{5}$.
