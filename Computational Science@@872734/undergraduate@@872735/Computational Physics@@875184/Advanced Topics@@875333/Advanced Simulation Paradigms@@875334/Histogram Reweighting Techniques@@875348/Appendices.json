The Hamiltonian is $H = -\\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle} s_i s_j$ with $s_i \\in \\{-1,+1\\}$ and the sum over nearest neighbors on the square lattice. Let $N=L^2$ be the number of spins and $N_b=2N$ be the number of bonds. For $L=4$ (so $N=16$), the possible total energies are the nine values $-32,-24,-16,-8,0,8,16,24,32$ (in units of $J$). In the canonical ensemble at inverse temperature $\\beta=1/T$, the probability of observing energy $E$ is $p_\\beta(E) \\propto g(E)\\,\\exp(-\\beta E)$, where $g(E)$ is the density of states (degeneracy). The specific heat per spin is defined by $C(T)=\\beta^2\\,\\mathrm{Var}_\\beta(E)/N$.\n\nYou are given binned Monte Carlo energy histograms for the $L=4$ system at three temperatures: one below the critical temperature, one near it, and one above it. Each histogram reports counts for the same nine energy bins listed above, in that order. The three temperatures and their histograms (each summing to $100000$ samples) are:\n- Temperature $T_1 = 2.0$, counts (aligned with energies in order $-32$ to $32$): $[36000, 42000, 18000, 3000, 800, 100, 60, 30, 10]$.\n- Temperature $T_2 = 2.269$, counts: $[6000, 14000, 24000, 23000, 17000, 9000, 4000, 2000, 1000]$.\n- Temperature $T_3 = 3.0$, counts: $[1000, 4000, 9000, 16000, 21000, 20000, 16000, 9000, 4000]$.\n\nStarting from first principles of the canonical ensemble and without assuming any prior knowledge of the density of states $g(E)$, use histogram reweighting to estimate $g(E)$ from the three histograms together and then compute the specific heat per spin $C(T)$ at a set of target temperatures. Your method must rely only on the provided histograms and must not use any external data or further simulations. You must:\n- Justify and implement a statistically sound combination of multiple histograms collected at different temperatures to infer $g(E)$ up to a multiplicative constant, by enforcing consistency with the canonical probabilities.\n- From the inferred $g(E)$, compute the partition function at any target temperature $T$ as a discrete sum over the nine energies, and evaluate the energy mean and variance to obtain $C(T)$.\n\nAssume that all histograms are drawn from independent samples (you may ignore autocorrelation corrections). All calculations are in units where $k_B=1$ and $J=1$, and the required output is the specific heat per spin, which is dimensionless in these units.\n\nTest suite: compute $C(T)$ for the following target temperatures (in units of $J$): $[1.8, 2.0, 2.269, 2.5, 3.0, 3.2]$.

All outputs are specific heats per spin in units with $k_B=1$.", "solution": "The problem presented is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It requires the application of the multiple histogram reweighting method, a standard and powerful technique in computational statistical physics, to analyze simulated data for the two-dimensional Ising model. We will therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe basis for this analysis is the canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics. For a system at a fixed inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/T$ (with Boltzmann constant $k_B=1$), the probability $p_\\beta(E)$ of observing a microstate with energy $E$ is given by:\n$$\np_\\beta(E) = \\frac{g(E) e^{-\\beta E}}{Z(\\beta)}\n$$\nHere, $g(E)$ is the density of states (or degeneracy), which is the number of distinct microstates corresponding to the energy $E$. The partition function, $Z(\\beta)$, serves as the normalization constant and is defined by the sum over all possible energy levels $E_i$:\n$$\nZ(\\beta) = \\sum_{i} g(E_i) e^{-\\beta E_i}\n$$\nThe problem provides data from $R=3$ independent Monte Carlo simulations, performed at inverse temperatures $\\beta_j=1/T_j$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. For each simulation $j$, we are given a histogram of energies, which contains the counts $n_{ij}$ of observing the energy $E_i$ out of a total of $M_j$ samples. The empirical probability is thus $n_{ij}/M_j$. This provides an estimate for the true canonical probability:\n$$\n\\frac{n_{ij}}{M_j} \\approx p_{\\beta_j}(E_i) = \\frac{g(E_i) e^{-\\beta_j E_i}}{Z(\\beta_j)}\n$$\nFrom this relation, one can derive an estimate for the density of states $g(E_i)$ using data from a single simulation $j$:\n$$\ng(E_i) \\propto \\frac{n_{ij}}{M_j} e^{\\beta_j E_i}\n$$\nThe proportionality constant involves the unknown partition function $Z(\\beta_j)$. A more robust estimate for $g(E_i)$ can be obtained by combining the data from all $R$ simulations. The statistically optimal way to do this is via the multiple histogram method, also known as the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). This method yields an improved estimate for $g(E_i)$ that is consistent with all datasets simultaneously. The combined estimate for the density of states is given by:\n$$\ng(E_i) = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{R} n_{ij}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{R} M_j e^{f_j - \\beta_j E_i}}\n$$\nwhere the parameters $f_j$ are related to the dimensionless free energies of the simulations, $F_j = -T_j \\ln Z(\\beta_j)$, such that $Z(\\beta_j) \\propto e^{-f_j}$. These parameters must be determined self-consistently. Substituting the expression for $g(E_i)$ back into the definition of the partition function $Z(\\beta_k) \\propto e^{-f_k}$ gives the set of self-consistency equations:\n$$\ne^{-f_k} = \\sum_{i} g(E_i) e^{-\\beta_k E_i} = \\sum_{i} \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{R} n_{ij}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{R} M_j e^{f_j - \\beta_j E_i}} e^{-\\beta_k E_i} \\quad \\text{for } k=1, \\dots, R\n$$\nThese $R$ coupled nonlinear equations for the $R$ unknowns $\\{f_1, \\dots, f_R\\}$ can be solved iteratively. It is important to note that if $\\{f_j\\}$ is a solution, then $\\{f_j + C\\}$ is also a solution for any constant $C$. This gauge freedom is fixed by setting one of the parameters to a constant, for example, $f_1=0$. To ensure numerical stability, the iterative solution is best implemented using logarithms, particularly the `log-sum-exp` technique to handle sums of exponentials.\n\nThe iterative procedure is as follows:\n1. Initialize the parameters, for instance, $f_j = 0$ for all $j=1, \\dots, R$.\n2. In each iteration, compute an updated estimate for the logarithm of the density of states, $\\ln g(E_i)$, for all energy levels $i$:\n   $$\n   \\ln g(E_i) = \\ln\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{R} n_{ij}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{R} M_j e^{f_j - \\beta_j E_i}\\right)\n   $$\n3. Use the new $\\ln g(E_i)$ to re-calculate the free energy parameters:\n   $$\n   f_k^{\\text{new}} = -\\ln\\left(\\sum_i e^{\\ln g(E_i) - \\beta_k E_i}\\right)\n   $$\n4. Normalize the new set $\\{f_k^{\\text{new}}\\}$, for instance by shifting all values so that the first element is zero: $f_k \\leftarrow f_k^{\\text{new}} - f_1^{\\text{new}}$.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the values of $\\{f_j\\}$ converge to within a desired tolerance.\n\nOnce the converged values of $f_j$ are obtained, we have the final estimate for $\\ln g(E_i)$ (up to an irrelevant additive constant). This allows for the calculation of any thermodynamic observable at any target inverse temperature $\\beta_{\\text{target}}$. The expectation value of a quantity $A(E)$ is:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle_{\\beta_{\\text{target}}} = \\frac{\\sum_i A(E_i) g(E_i) e^{-\\beta_{\\text{target}} E_i}}{\\sum_i g(E_i) e^{-\\beta_{\\text{target}} E_i}} = \\frac{\\sum_i A(E_i) e^{\\ln g(E_i) - \\beta_{\\text{target}} E_i}}{\\sum_i e^{\\ln g(E_i) - \\beta_{\\text{target}} E_i}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the computation of the specific heat per spin, $C(T)$, defined as:\n$$\nC(T) = \\frac{\\beta^2}{N} \\text{Var}_\\beta(E) = \\frac{\\beta^2}{N} \\left(\\langle E^2 \\rangle_\\beta - \\langle E \\rangle_\\beta^2\\right)\n$$\nwhere $N=16$ is the number of spins.

All energies must be expressed in units of $k_\\mathrm{B} T$ and are therefore dimensionless. Angles do not appear. The final output must be a single line containing a list of floating-point numbers as specified below.\n\nThe fundamental basis for your derivation and implementation must be:\n- The Boltzmann distribution $p(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp\\{-\\beta U(\\mathbf{z})\\}$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_\\mathrm{B} T)$ and $\\mathbf{z} = (x,y)^\\top$ denotes the microscopic coordinates.\n- The principle of umbrella sampling with added bias potentials, which shifts sampling to improve coverage of regions of interest.\n- Discrete histogram reweighting founded on statistical consistency and maximum-likelihood arguments.\n\nYou must construct a model in which the unbiased potential energy is a two-dimensional quadratic form with a coupling term,\n$$\nU_0(\\mathbf{z}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{z}^\\top \\mathbf{K}\\,\\mathbf{z}, \\quad \\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_x & k_{xy} \\\\ k_{xy} & k_y \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nand the reaction coordinates are linear and non-orthogonal,\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\begin{pmatrix} s_1 \\\\ s_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{A}\\,\\mathbf{z}, \\quad \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & \\alpha \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nso that $s_1 = x$ and $s_2 = x + \\alpha y$, with $\\alpha \\neq 0$. For each umbrella window $i$, the bias is harmonic in both reaction coordinates,\n$$\nU^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_1\\,\\big(s_1 - c^{(i)}_1\\big)^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_2\\,\\big(s_2 - c^{(i)}_2\\big)^2.\n$$\nThe total biased energy in window $i$ is $U_0(\\mathbf{z}) + U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{z}))$. Because both $U_0$ and $U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}$ are quadratic and $\\mathbf{s}$ is linear, the biased distribution in $\\mathbf{z}$ is Gaussian and may be sampled exactly.\n\nYour program must:\n- For each specified test case, generate independent samples in each window $i$ by sampling from the Gaussian distribution proportional to $\\exp\\{-\\beta[U_0(\\mathbf{z}) + U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{z}))]\\}$ with exactly the given random seed. You must derive the associated Gaussian mean and covariance from first principles; do not use black-box samplers other than a multivariate normal with your derived parameters.\n- Discretize the $\\mathbf{s}$-space on a uniform grid with the provided bounds and number of bins, build a separate two-dimensional histogram for each window in $\\mathbf{s}$, and then combine the histograms using a statistically consistent WHAM fixed-point iteration to estimate the unbiased probability $P(\\mathbf{s})$ on the grid.\n- Convert $P(\\mathbf{s})$ to a free energy $F(\\mathbf{s}) = -\\ln P(\\mathbf{s})$ (in units of $k_\\mathrm{B} T$), and shift $F(\\mathbf{s})$ so that its minimum over the visited grid bins is zero.\n- Compute an analytical reference free energy $F_\\mathrm{ref}(\\mathbf{s})$ based on the exact Gaussian transformation of the unbiased distribution under $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{z}$, and shift it so that its minimum over the same visited bins is zero.\n- Calculate the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between $F(\\mathbf{s})$ and $F_\\mathrm{ref}(\\mathbf{s})$ over those grid bins whose total count across all windows is at least a specified threshold (use threshold count $\\geq 5$). The RMSE is a single floating-point number per test case.\n\nTest suite. Implement the above for the following three cases. In all cases, use $\\beta = 1$ (i.e., $k_\\mathrm{B} T$ as energy unit) and the same unbiased stiffness matrix,\n- Unbiased stiffness: $\\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.5 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.3 & 1.0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nCase $1$ (happy path):\n- Reaction coordinate non-orthogonality: $\\alpha = 0.5$.\n- Umbrella spring constants: $k_1 = 4.0$, $k_2 = 2.0$.\n- Umbrella centers: $\\{c^{(i)}_1\\} \\in \\{-1.2, 0.0, 1.2\\}$ and $\\{c^{(i)}_2\\} \\in \\{-1.2, 0.0, 1.2\\}$, forming a $3 \\times 3$ grid of windows.\n- Samples per window: $N_i = 4000$ for all $i$.\n- Histogram grid in $\\mathbf{s}$: $s_1 \\in [-2.0, 2.0]$ with $41$ bins; $s_2 \\in [-2.0, 2.0]$ with $41$ bins.\n- Random seed: $123$.\n\nCase $2$ (stronger non-orthogonality and stiffer umbrellas):\n- Reaction coordinate non-orthogonality: $\\alpha = 0.9$.\n- Umbrella spring constants: $k_1 = 6.0$, $k_2 = 6.0$.\n- Umbrella centers: $\\{c^{(i)}_1\\} \\in \\{-1.8, 0.0, 1.8\\}$ and $\\{c^{(i)}_2\\} \\in \\{-1.8, 0.0, 1.8\\}$, forming a $3 \\times 3$ grid.\n- Samples per window: $N_i = 1500$ for all $i$.\n- Histogram grid in $\\mathbf{s}$: $s_1 \\in [-3.0, 3.0]$ with $45$ bins; $s_2 \\in [-3.0, 3.0]$ with $45$ bins.\n- Random seed: $456$.\n\nCase $3$ (edge case with fewer windows and fewer samples):\n- Reaction coordinate non-orthogonality: $\\alpha = 0.2$.\n- Umbrella spring constants: $k_1 = 3.0$, $k_2 = 3.0$.\n- Umbrella centers: $\\{c^{(i)}_1\\} \\in \\{-1.2, 1.2\\}$ and $\\{c^{(i)}_2\\} \\in \\{-1.2, 1.2\\}$, forming a $2 \\times 2$ grid.\n- Samples per window: $N_i = 600$ for all $i$.\n- Histogram grid in $\\mathbf{s}$: $s_1 \\in [-2.0, 2.0]$ with $35$ bins; $s_2 \\in [-2.0, 2.0]$ with $35$ bins.\n- Random seed: $789$.\n\nAlgorithmic details you must honor:\n- For sampling in each window $i$, derive the Gaussian mean and covariance of the biased distribution in $\\mathbf{z}$ of the form $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{(i)}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{(i)})$ implied by $U_0(\\mathbf{z}) + U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{z}))$, and draw exactly $N_i$ samples using the stated seed.\n- Build separate two-dimensional histograms in $(s_1,s_2)$ for each window using the exact bin edges described above.\n- Implement a WHAM fixed-point iteration on the discrete grid that solves for a set of offsets $\\{f_i\\}$ and the unbiased probability $P(\\mathbf{s})$ on the grid, using stable numerical procedures.

All energies are dimensionless, expressed in units of $k_\\mathrm{B} T$, which is equivalent to setting $\\beta = (k_\\mathrm{B} T)^{-1} = 1$.\n\n### 1. Theoretical Framework\n\n**1.1. System Definition**\nThe unbiased potential energy of the system is a quadratic form in the Cartesian coordinates $\\mathbf{z} = (x, y)^\\top$:\n$$\nU_0(\\mathbf{z}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{z}^\\top \\mathbf{K}\\,\\mathbf{z}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{K}$ is a symmetric positive-definite stiffness matrix. The corresponding unbiased probability distribution is a multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\Sigma_z} = \\mathbf{K}^{-1}$:\n$$\np_0(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp(-U_0(\\mathbf{z})) \\implies \\mathbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{K}^{-1})\n$$\n\nThe reaction coordinates $\\mathbf{s} = (s_1, s_2)^\\top$ are a linear transformation of $\\mathbf{z}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\mathbf{A}\\,\\mathbf{z}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}$ is an invertible matrix, signifying that the reaction coordinates are not orthogonal in general.\n\nUmbrella sampling is performed in a set of $M$ simulation windows, indexed by $i = 1, \\dots, M$. In each window $i$, a harmonic bias potential $U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s})$ is added to restrain the system near a center $\\mathbf{c}^{(i)} = (c^{(i)}_1, c^{(i)}_2)^\\top$ in reaction coordinate space:\n$$\nU^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{s} - \\mathbf{c}^{(i)})^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} (\\mathbf{s} - \\mathbf{c}^{(i)})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} = \\mathrm{diag}(k_1, k_2)$ is the diagonal matrix of harmonic force constants.\n\n**1.2. Biased Distribution for Data Generation**\nThe total potential energy in window $i$ is $U^{(i)}(\\mathbf{z}) = U_0(\\mathbf{z}) + U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{z}))$. To generate samples, we must determine the parameters of the resulting probability distribution $p^{(i)}(\\mathbf{z}) \\propto \\exp(-U^{(i)}(\\mathbf{z}))$. Substituting the definitions, we have:\n$$\nU^{(i)}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{z}^\\top \\mathbf{K}\\,\\mathbf{z} + \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{c}^{(i)})^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{c}^{(i)})\n$$\nExpanding the second term gives:\n$$\nU^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{z})) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{z}^\\top (\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{A}) \\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{z}^\\top (\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{c}^{(i)}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{c}^{(i)})^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{c}^{(i)}\n$$\nCombining terms, the total potential is:\n$$\nU^{(i)}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{z}^\\top (\\mathbf{K} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{A}) \\mathbf{z} - \\mathbf{z}^\\top (\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{c}^{(i)}) + \\mathrm{const.}\n$$\nThis is the exponent of a Gaussian distribution. A general Gaussian density for $\\mathbf{z}$ with mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and covariance $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ is proportional to $\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{z}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^\\top\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}(\\mathbf{z}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}))$, which expands to $\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{z}^\\top\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mathbf{z} + \\mathbf{z}^\\top\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\mu} + \\mathrm{const.})$. By comparing this form with $\\exp(-U^{(i)}(\\mathbf{z}))$, we identify the inverse covariance and the mean of the biased distribution in window $i$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(i)^{-1}} = \\mathbf{K} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{A}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(i)^{-1}} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{c}^{(i)}\n$$\nSolving for the parameters yields the sampling distribution for $\\mathbf{z}$ in window $i$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{(i)}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(i)})\n$$\nwith covariance $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(i)} = (\\mathbf{K} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{A})^{-1}$ and mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{(i)} (\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{K}_\\mathrm{b} \\mathbf{c}^{(i)})$.\n\n**1.3. Analytical Reference Free Energy**\nThe unbiased distribution of the reaction coordinates $\\mathbf{s}$ can be found from the properties of linear transformations of Gaussian variables. Since $\\mathbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{K}^{-1})$ and $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{z}$, the distribution of $\\mathbf{s}$ is also Gaussian, $\\mathbf{s} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu_s}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma_s})$, with mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu_s} = \\mathbf{A}\\boldsymbol{\\mu_z} = \\mathbf{0}$ and covariance $\\mathbf{\\Sigma_s} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{\\Sigma_z} \\mathbf{A}^\\top = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\mathbf{A}^\\top$.\n\nThe probability density is $p(\\mathbf{s}) \\propto \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{s}^\\top \\mathbf{\\Sigma_s}^{-1} \\mathbf{s})$. The analytical free energy is defined as $F(\\mathbf{s}) = -\\ln p(\\mathbf{s})$ (in units of $k_\\mathrm{B} T$). Thus, up to an irrelevant additive constant:\n$$\nF_\\mathrm{ref}(\\mathbf{s}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{s}^\\top (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\mathbf{A}^\\top)^{-1} \\mathbf{s}\n$$\nThis provides the theoretical ground truth against which the WHAM reconstruction is compared.\n\n**1.4. WHAM Implementation**\nData from all $M$ windows are combined using WHAM. The reaction coordinate space $\\mathbf{s}$ is discretized into a grid of bins, indexed by $j$. Let $H_{ij}$ be the number of samples from window $i$ falling into bin $j$, and $N_i = \\sum_j H_{ij}$ be the total samples from window $i$. The goal of WHAM is to find the unbiased probability $P_j$ for each bin $j$ and the dimensionless free energy offset $f_i$ for each window $i$. These are determined by the self-consistent equations:\n$$\nP_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^M H_{ij}}{\\sum_{i=1}^M N_i \\exp(f_i - U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}_j))}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-f_i) = \\sum_j P_j \\exp(-U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}_j))\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{s}_j$ is the coordinate of the center of bin $j$. These equations are solved iteratively. For numerical stability, the calculations are performed in logarithmic space.\n\nThe iterative procedure is as follows:\n1. Initialize $f_i = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, M$.\n2. Repeatedly update $\\{f_i\\}$ and $\\{P_j\\}$ until convergence:\n   a. For each visited bin $j$ (where $\\sum_i H_{ij} > 0$), calculate an unnormalized probability $P'_j$ using the current $\\{f_i\\}$:\n      $$\n      \\ln P'_j = \\ln\\left(\\sum_i H_{ij}\\right) - \\mathrm{logsumexp}_i(\\ln N_i + f_i - U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}_j))\n      $$\n   b. Normalize the probabilities over the set of all visited bins:\n      $$\n      \\ln P_j = \\ln P'_j - \\mathrm{logsumexp}_{k \\in \\text{visited}} (\\ln P'_k)\n      $$\n   c. Update the free energy offsets $\\{f_i\\}$ using the new probabilities $\\{P_j\\}$:\n      $$\n      f_i^{\\text{new}} = -\\mathrm{logsumexp}_{j \\in \\text{visited}} (\\ln P_j - U^{(i)}_\\mathrm{b}(\\mathbf{s}_j))\n      $$\n   d. To prevent numerical drift, anchor the free energies, e.g., $f_i \\leftarrow f_i^{\\text{new}} - f_1^{\\text{new}}$.\n   e. Check for convergence, for instance, by requiring the maximum absolute change in any $f_i$ to be below a small tolerance (e.g., $10^{-9}$).\n\n**1.5. Free Energy Surface and Error Calculation**\nOnce the converged probabilities $P_j$ are obtained, the free energy surface is computed as $F_j = -\\ln P_j$. This surface is defined only for visited bins; $F_j$ is infinite otherwise. For comparison, the surface is shifted so its minimum value over the visited bins is zero.\n\nThe analytical reference free energy $F_{\\mathrm{ref}, j}$ is evaluated at the bin centers $\\mathbf{s}_j$. It is then shifted by subtracting its minimum value calculated over the same set of visited bins. This ensures a consistent reference for the error calculation.\n\nThe Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) is calculated to quantify the accuracy of the reconstruction. The comparison is restricted to bins with a total sample count $\\sum_i H_{ij}$ of at least $5$, to exclude statistically unreliable regions. Let $\\mathcal{J}$ be the set of such bins. The RMSE is:\n$$\n\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{J}|} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{J}} (F_j - F_{\\mathrm{ref}, j})^2}\n$$\nThe procedure is applied to each of the three test cases specified in the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import logsumexp\n\ndef run_analysis(K_unbiased, alpha, k_bias, c1_centers, c2_centers, n_samples_per_window, s_lims, n_bins, seed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a complete WHAM analysis for a single test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
