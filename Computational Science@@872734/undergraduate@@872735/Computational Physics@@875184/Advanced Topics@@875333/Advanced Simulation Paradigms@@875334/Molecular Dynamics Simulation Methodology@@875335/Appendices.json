This exercise introduces event-driven molecular dynamics, an algorithm that is exact for models like hard rods or spheres. By focusing on calculating the precise time of the next collision and advancing the system from one discrete event to the next, you will build a simulation from first principles and gain a deeper understanding of how dynamics are propagated [@problem_id:2414281].", "problem": "You are tasked with formulating and implementing a complete computational model for the one-dimensional molecular dynamics of identical hard rods. Consider a one-dimensional segment from position $x=0$ to position $x=L$ containing $N$ identical hard rods of length $a$ and mass $m$. Each rod is represented by its center coordinate $x_i(t)$ and its velocity $v_i(t)$ for $i\\in\\{1,\\dots,N\\}$. There are no external forces. The rods are perfectly rigid and cannot overlap. When two rods collide, the collision is instantaneous and perfectly elastic. When a rod collides with a wall at $x=0$ or $x=L$, the collision is instantaneous and perfectly elastic. Assume all masses are equal and that the only motion is along the line.\n\nThe physical rules are as follows:\n- Between collisions, each center moves with constant velocity, so $x_i(t)$ evolves linearly in time.\n- A rod cannot cross a wall; the center coordinate must satisfy $x_i(t)\\in[a/2,L-a/2]$ at all times.\n- In any perfectly elastic collision between two identical masses, the post-collision velocities are given by exchanging the pre-collision velocities of the two colliding rods.\n- In any perfectly elastic collision of a rod with a wall, the post-collision velocity is given by reversing the sign of the pre-collision velocity, while the center remains within the allowable interval.\n\nAll quantities must be treated in the International System of Units (SI units). Positions must be expressed in meters, velocities in meters per second, and time in seconds. All initial centers are strictly increasing and non-overlapping. There are no angle quantities in this problem.\n\nYour task is to write a complete, runnable program that computes, for each of the following specified test cases, the list of final center positions $\\{x_i(T)\\}_{i=1}^N$ at time $T$, in meters, ordered by the initial indexing of the rods (which coincides with strictly increasing initial positions). Each final position in each test case must be rounded to exactly six digits after the decimal point. Your program must not read any input and must print a single line of output that aggregates the results for all test cases as a single comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself the square-bracketed, comma-separated list of final positions for that test case. The printed line must have no spaces. For example, if there are two test cases with final positions lists $[x_{1,1},x_{1,2}]$ and $[x_{2,1}]$, the output must be of the form $[[x_{1,1},x_{1,2}],[x_{2,1}]]$, using the required rounding.\n\nUse the following test suite, which is designed to cover general behavior, wall reflections, pair collisions, and sequences of different collision types.

It is a well-posed problem grounded in the principles of classical mechanics. My duty is to validate its premises and, if valid, to provide a rigorous, algorithmically sound solution.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, I have examined the problem statement for logical consistency, scientific soundness, and completeness.\nThe givens are:\n- A one-dimensional space of length $L$.\n- $N$ identical hard rods of length $a$ and mass $m$.\n- The state of rod $i$ is described by its center position $x_i(t)$ and velocity $v_i(t)$.\n- The center of each rod $i$ is constrained to the interval $[a/2, L-a/2]$.\n- Motion between collisions is uniform: $x_i(t)$ is linear.\n- Collision rules are provided:\n    1. For a collision between two rods, their velocities are exchanged. This is consistent with an elastic collision of two identical masses in one dimension, where conservation of momentum and kinetic energy dictates that $v_i' = v_j$ and $v_j' = v_i$.\n    2. For a collision between a rod and a wall, the rod's velocity is reversed. This corresponds to a perfectly elastic reflection.\n- All required parameters ($N$, $L$, $a$, $T$) and initial conditions ($x_i(0)$, $v_i(0)$) are specified for each test case.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, a classic model system. The initial conditions provided for all test cases are physically valid; rods are non-overlapping and within the specified boundaries. A potential ambiguity could arise from simultaneous collisions (more than two particles colliding at the same instant). An analysis of the provided test cases reveals one instance of simultaneous events, but these events involve disjoint sets of particles. Such cases are unambiguous and can be resolved consistently. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Methodology: Event-Driven Simulation**\n\nThe system dynamics are piecewise linear, with state changes occurring only at discrete moments in time, i.e., collisions. This structure lends itself to an event-driven simulation approach, which is significantly more efficient and accurate than a fixed time-step method for this class of problems. The simulation proceeds by calculating the time to the next collision event, advancing the system state to that moment, and then resolving the collision by updating the velocities of the involved particles.\n\nThe state of the system at any time $t$ is given by the set of positions and velocities $\\{x_i(t), v_i(t)\\}_{i=1}^N$. Between events, the position of rod $i$ evolves according to the equation of motion for a free particle:\n$$x_i(t + \\Delta t) = x_i(t) + v_i(t) \\Delta t$$\n\nThe core of the simulation is to determine the time interval $\\Delta t$ to the next event. There are two types of events: a collision between two adjacent rods, and a collision of a rod with a wall.\n\n**1. Rod-Rod Collision Time**\n\nA collision between two adjacent rods, $i$ and $i+1$ (assuming $x_i  x_{i+1}$), occurs when the distance between their centers becomes equal to their length, $a$. That is, $x_{i+1}(t) - x_i(t) = a$. Let the current time be $t_{curr}$ with positions $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ and velocities $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$. We seek the time interval $\\Delta t$ such that:\n$$x_{i+1}(t_{curr} + \\Delta t) - x_i(t_{curr} + \\Delta t) = a$$\n$$(x_{i+1} + v_{i+1}\\Delta t) - (x_i + v_i\\Delta t) = a$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t$, we find the time to collision for the pair $(i, i+1)$:\n$$\\Delta t_{i,i+1} = \\frac{x_{i+1} - x_i - a}{v_i - v_{i+1}}$$\nA collision can occur only if the rods are approaching each other, which means the relative velocity $v_i - v_{i+1}$ must be positive. Since the initial separation $x_{i+1} - x_i$ is greater than $a$, the numerator is positive. Thus, we only consider cases where $\\Delta t_{i,i+1}  0$. In a one-dimensional system of hard rods that cannot pass through one another, a rod can only collide with its immediate neighbors. Therefore, we only need to compute collision times for adjacent pairs $(i, i+1)$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n\n**2. Rod-Wall Collision Time**\n\nA rod $i$ collides with a wall when its center reaches the boundary of its allowed domain, $[a/2, L-a/2]$.\n- Collision with the left wall (at $x=0$): The center reaches $x_i = a/2$.\n  $$x_i + v_i \\Delta t = a/2 \\implies \\Delta t_{i,L} = \\frac{a/2 - x_i}{v_i}$$\n  For a future collision, $\\Delta t_{i,L}$ must be positive. Since $x_i  a/2$, the numerator is negative, so a collision is possible only if $v_i  0$.\n- Collision with the right wall (at $x=L$): The center reaches $x_i = L-a/2$.\n  $$x_i + v_i \\Delta t = L - a/2 \\implies \\Delta t_{i,R} = \\frac{L - a/2 - x_i}{v_i}$$\n  For a future collision, $\\Delta t_{i,R}$ must be positive. Since $x_i  L-a/2$, the numerator is positive, so a collision is possible only if $v_i  0$.\n\n**Simulation Algorithm**\n\nThe simulation iterates through time from $t=0$ to $T$ by executing the following steps in a loop:\n\n1.  Initialize the system state: simulation time $t \\leftarrow 0$, positions $x_i \\leftarrow x_i(0)$, and velocities $v_i \\leftarrow v_i(0)$.\n2.  While $t  T$:\n    a. Calculate all possible future collision times: $\\Delta t_{i,i+1}$ for all adjacent pairs, and $\\Delta t_{i,L}$, $\\Delta t_{i,R}$ for all rods. Collect only the positive, non-zero results. A small positive tolerance ($\\epsilon  0$) must be used for time comparisons to avoid infinite loops caused by floating-point arithmetic.\n    b. Find the minimum of these valid collision times, $\\Delta t_{min}$. If no future collisions are possible, set $\\Delta t_{min}$ to infinity.\n    c. Determine the time step for the next evolution: $\\Delta t_{step} = \\min(\\Delta t_{min}, T - t)$.\n    d. Evolve the system state: Advance the current time $t \\leftarrow t + \\Delta t_{step}$, and update all positions: $x_i \\leftarrow x_i + v_i \\Delta t_{step}$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$.\n    e. If a collision occurred (i.e., $\\Delta t_{step} = \\Delta t_{min}$), identify all collision events that occur at this exact time. For each event, update the velocities of the involved particles according to the collision rules:\n        - For a rod-rod collision between $i$ and $j$: $v_i' = v_j$ and $v_j' = v_i$.\n        - For a wall collision involving rod $i$: $v_i' = -v_i$.\n        If multiple disjoint collisions occur simultaneously, all corresponding velocity updates are applied.\n3.  Upon loop termination, the final positions $\\{x_i(T)\\}$ are reported.\n\nThis algorithm guarantees that the system is evolved exactly from one event to the next, providing a precise trajectory.

An equivalent formulation starts from $P = \\rho k_B T + \\frac{1}{3V} \\sum_{ij} \\langle \\mathbf{r}_{ij} \\cdot \\mathbf{f}_{ji} \\rangle$, which leads to the same final expression. A sign error can easily arise if definitions are mixed. We will proceed with the latter, correct form.\n\nThe Lennard-Jones potential is given by:\n$$\nu(r) = 4\\epsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}\\right]\n$$\nThe derivative with respect to $r$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}r} = 4\\epsilon \\left[-12\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}} + 6\\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{r^{7}}\\right]\n$$\nThe pair virial term $r (\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}r)$ is thus:\n$$\nr \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}r} = 4\\epsilon \\left[-12\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} + 6\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}\\right] = -24\\epsilon \\left[2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}\\right]\n$$\nThe problem specifies reduced units where $\\epsilon=1$, $\\sigma=1$, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}=1$. The box is cubic with side length $L$, so $V=L^3$. The potential is truncated at a cutoff radius $r_{\\mathrm{c}}=2.5\\sigma=2.5$. The pressure equation for a single configuration becomes:\n$$\nP = \\frac{N T}{L^3} - \\frac{1}{3L^3} \\sum_{\\substack{ij \\\\ r_{ij}  r_{\\mathrm{c}}}} \\left(-24 \\left[2r_{ij}^{-12} - r_{ij}^{-6}\\right]\\right)\n$$\n$$\nP = \\frac{N T}{L^3} + \\frac{8}{L^3} \\sum_{\\substack{ij \\\\ r_{ij}  r_{\\mathrm{c}}}} \\left(2r_{ij}^{-12} - r_{ij}^{-6}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the central formula for implementation. The difference between the correct and erroneous algorithms lies solely in the calculation of the separation vector $\\mathbf{r}_{ij}$ and its magnitude $r_{ij}$.\n\n**Correct Algorithm (with Periodic Boundary Conditions):**\nFor each pair of particles $(i, j)$ with $ij$:\n1. Compute the raw separation vector $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{raw}} = \\mathbf{r}_j - \\mathbf{r}_i$.\n2. Apply the minimum image convention (MIC) to each component $\\alpha \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$ to find the separation vector $\\mathbf{r}_{ij}$ in the periodic box:\n   $$\n   \\Delta r_{\\alpha} \\leftarrow \\Delta r_{\\alpha}^{\\text{raw}} - L \\cdot \\mathrm{round}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Delta r_{\\alpha}^{\\text{raw}}}{L}\\right)\n   $$\n3. Compute the squared distance $r_{ij}^2 = (\\Delta r_x)^2 + (\\Delta r_y)^2 + (\\Delta r_z)^2$.\n4. If $r_{ij}^2  r_{\\mathrm{c}}^2$, calculate its contribution to the virial sum. Otherwise, the contribution is zero.\n\n**Erroneous Algorithm (without Periodic Boundary Conditions):**\nFor each pair of particles $(i, j)$ with $ij$:\n1. Compute the raw separation vector $\\mathbf{r}_{ij} = \\mathbf{r}_j - \\mathbf{r}_i$.\n2. Do not apply the minimum image convention.\n3. Compute the squared distance $r_{ij}^2 = (\\Delta r_x)^2 + (\\Delta r_y)^2 + (\\Delta r_z)^2$.\n4. If $r_{ij}^2  r_{\\mathrm{c}}^2$, calculate its contribution to the virial sum using this raw distance.\n\nThe implementation will apply these two procedures to the provided test cases. The total configurational virial, $W = \\sum_{ij, r_{ij}r_c} 24(2r_{ij}^{-12} - r_{ij}^{-6})$, is computed first, and the final pressure is then calculated as $P = \\frac{NT}{L^3} + \\frac{W}{3L^3}$. However, due to the derivation sign correction, our formula is $P = \\frac{NT}{L^3} - \\frac{1}{3L^3}\\sum W_{pair}$, where $W_{pair} = r \\frac{du}{dr} = -24(2r^{-12} - r^{-6})$. This is equivalent to $P = \\frac{NT}{L^3} + \\frac{8}{L^3} \\sum (2r^{-12} - r^{-6})$. Both are mathematically identical.
