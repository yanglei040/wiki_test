It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational physics, specifically using the Lennard-Jones potential to model atomic cluster energetics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, constants, and clear objectives for a deterministic solution. Its language is objective and its structure is logically consistent, free from contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe total potential energy $E$ for a system of $N$ particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones (LJ) pair potential is given by the sum over all unique pairs of particles $(i, j)$:\n$$\nE = \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} U(\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j \\right\\rVert)\n$$\nIn reduced units, where the energy unit $\\varepsilon=1$ and the length unit $\\sigma=1$, the LJ potential simplifies to:\n$$\nU(r) = 4 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^{6} \\right]\n$$\nThe problem considers configurations generated by uniformly scaling a base template of coordinates $\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i,0}\\}$ by a positive factor $s  0$. The position of the $i$-th particle is $\\mathbf{r}_i = s \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{i,0}$. The distance $r_{ij}$ between particles $i$ and $j$ is thus also scaled by $s$:\n$$\nr_{ij} = \\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j \\right\\rVert = \\left\\lVert s \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{i,0} - s \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{j,0} \\right\\rVert = s \\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{i,0} - \\mathbf{r}_{j,0} \\right\\rVert = s \\cdot r_{ij,0}\n$$\nwhere $r_{ij,0}$ is the distance in the unscaled template (i.e., for $s=1$).\n\nSubstituting this scaled distance into the energy expression, the total energy $E$ becomes a function of $s$:\n$$\nE(s) = \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} 4 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{s \\cdot r_{ij,0}}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{1}{s \\cdot r_{ij,0}}\\right)^{6} \\right]\n$$\nBy factoring out the terms involving $s$, we can separate the geometry of the cluster from the scaling:\n$$\nE(s) = 4 \\left[ \\frac{1}{s^{12}} \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\frac{1}{r_{ij,0}^{12}} - \\frac{1}{s^6} \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\frac{1}{r_{ij,0}^6} \\right]\n$$\nWe define the geometric sums $S_{12}$ and $S_6$, which depend only on the fixed template geometry:\n$$\nS_{12} = \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\frac{1}{r_{ij,0}^{12}}, \\qquad S_6 = \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\frac{1}{r_{ij,0}^6}\n$$\nThe total energy as a function of the scale factor $s$ is then elegantly expressed as:\n$$\nE(s) = 4 \\left( \\frac{S_{12}}{s^{12}} - \\frac{S_6}{s^6} \\right)\n$$\nTo find the scale factor $s^\\star$ that minimizes the energy, we must solve for $s$ where the derivative of $E(s)$ with respect to $s$ is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{ds} = 4 \\left( -12 \\frac{S_{12}}{s^{13}} + 6 \\frac{S_6}{s^7} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $s$ (which we denote $s^\\star$) gives:\n$$\n12 \\frac{S_{12}}{(s^\\star)^{13}} = 6 \\frac{S_6}{(s^\\star)^7} \\implies 2 S_{12} = S_6 (s^\\star)^6 \\implies (s^\\star)^6 = \\frac{2 S_{12}}{S_6}\n$$\nThe optimal scale factor is therefore:\n$$\ns^\\star = \\left( \\frac{2 S_{12}}{S_6} \\right)^{1/6}\n$$\nThe minimum energy $E^\\star = E(s^\\star)$ is found by substituting $(s^\\star)^6$ and $(s^\\star)^{12} = ( (s^\\star)^6 )^2 = \\left(\\frac{2 S_{12}}{S_6}\\right)^2$ back into the energy function:\n$$\nE^\\star = 4 \\left( S_{12} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{S_6}{2 S_{12}}\\right)^2 \\right] - S_6 \\left[ \\frac{S_6}{2 S_{12}} \\right] \\right) = 4 \\left( \\frac{S_6^2}{4 S_{12}} - \\frac{S_6^2}{2 S_{12}} \\right) = 4 \\left( -\\frac{S_6^2}{4 S_{12}} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the minimal potential energy for the scaled structure:\n$$\nE^\\star = -\\frac{S_6^2}{S_{12}}\n$$\nThis fundamental result shows that the minimum energy is determined entirely by the geometric properties of the unscaled particle configuration.\n\nThe invariance of the total energy under rigid motions (translations and rotations) is a direct consequence of the potential depending only on interparticle distances.\n- **Translation Invariance**: Let each particle's position vector $\\mathbf{r}_i$ be shifted by a constant vector $\\mathbf{v}$ to a new position $\\mathbf{r}_i' = \\mathbf{r}_i + \\mathbf{v}$. The vector difference between any two particles remains unchanged: $\\mathbf{r}_i' - \\mathbf{r}_j' = (\\mathbf{r}_i + \\mathbf{v}) - (\\mathbf{r}_j + \\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j$. Consequently, the distance $\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i' - \\mathbf{r}_j' \\right\\rVert = \\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j \\right\\rVert$ is invariant. Since all pairwise distances are unchanged, the total energy $E$ is unchanged.\n- **Rotation Invariance**: Let each particle's position vector $\\mathbf{r}_i$ be transformed by a rotation matrix $R$, giving a new position $\\mathbf{r}_i' = R \\mathbf{r}_i$. Rotations are isometries, meaning they preserve distances. The squared distance between two rotated points is $\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i' - \\mathbf{r}_j' \\right\\rVert^2 = \\left\\lVert R(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j) \\right\\rVert^2 = (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j)^T R^T R (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j)$. Since $R$ is an orthogonal matrix, $R^T R = I$ (the identity matrix), so $\\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i' - \\mathbf{r}_j' \\right\\rVert^2 = \\left\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j \\right\\rVert^2$. The scalar distances are preserved, and thus the total energy $E$ is invariant.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  Generate the unscaled coordinates for the $N=13$ icosahedral and FCC cuboctahedral clusters. The icosahedral vertices use the golden ratio $\\varphi = (1+\\sqrt{5})/2$.\n2.  For each template, compute all unique pairwise distances $r_{ij,0}$ and use them to calculate the geometric sums $S_6$ and $S_{12}$.\n3.  Calculate the minimized energy $E^\\star$ for each configuration using the derived formula $E^\\star = -S_6^2 / S_{12}$.\n4.  For the icosahedral cluster, calculate the optimal scale factor $s^\\star_{ico}$ and scale the template coordinates to obtain the energy-minimized positions $\\{\\mathbf{r}_i^\\star\\}$.\n5.  Verify energy invariance by applying the specified rotation (angle $\\theta=0.789$ rad about axis $(1,2,3)$) and translation (vector $(0.3,-1.1,2.0)$) to the optimized icosahedral coordinates. The energy of the transformed coordinates is computed and compared to the original minimized energy within a tolerance of $10^{-10}$.\n6.  Finally, the energy of the icosahedral configuration is computed at $s = 0.5 s^\\star_{ico}$ and $s = 2.0 s^\\star_{ico}$ to confirm that these energies are higher than the minimum, as expected from the nature of the potential well.\nAll calculations are performed in reduced LJ units ($\\varepsilon=1$, $\\sigma=1$).", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import pdist\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and compares the minimum potential energies for N=13\n    Lennard-Jones clusters in icosahedral and FCC cuboctahedral configurations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_cluster_coordinates(name: str) - np.ndarray:\n        \"\"\"Generates the template coordinates for a given cluster type.\"\"\"\n        if name == 'icosahedron':\n            phi = (1.0 + np.sqrt(5.0)) / 2.0\n            vertices = [\n                (0, 1, phi), (0, 1, -phi), (0, -1, phi), (0, -1, -phi),\n                (1, phi, 0), (1, -phi, 0), (-1, phi, 0), (-1, -phi, 0),\n                (phi, 0, 1), (-phi, 0, 1), (phi, 0, -1), (-phi, 0, -1)\n            ]\n        elif name == 'fcc_cuboctahedron':\n            vertices = [\n                (1, 1, 0), (1, -1, 0), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, -1, 0),\n                (1, 0, 1), (1, 0, -1), (-1, 0, 1), (-1, 0, -1),\n                (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, -1), (0, -1, 1), (0, -1, -1)\n            ]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Unknown cluster name\")\n\n        coords = np.array([(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)] + vertices, dtype=np.float64)\n        return coords\n\n    def compute_geometric_sums(coords: np.ndarray) - tuple[float, float]:\n        \"\"\"Computes the geometric sums S6 and S12 from coordinates.\"\"\"\n        # pdist computes the condensed distance matrix (upper triangle)\n        distances = pdist(coords)\n        \n        # Element-wise exponentiation\n        inv_dists_6 = np.power(distances, -6)\n        inv_dists_12 = np.power(distances, -12)\n\n        s6 = np.sum(inv_dists_6)\n        s12 = np.sum(inv_dists_12)\n        \n        return s6, s12\n\n    def calculate_total_energy(coords: np.ndarray) - float:\n        \"\"\"Computes the total LJ potential energy for a set of coordinates.\"\"\"\n        distances = pdist(coords)\n        inv_dists_6 = np.power(distances, -6)\n        inv_dists_12 = np.power(distances, -12)\n        energy = 4.0 * (np.sum(inv_dists_12) - np.sum(inv_dists_6))\n        return energy\n\n    # --- Icosahedral Cluster ---\n    coords_ico_0 = get_cluster_coordinates('icosahedron')\n    S6_ico, S12_ico = compute_geometric_sums(coords_ico_0)\n    E_ico_min = -S6_ico**2 / S12_ico\n    s_ico_star = (2 * S12_ico / S6_ico)**(1/6)\n\n    # --- FCC Cuboctahedral Cluster ---\n    coords_fcc_0 = get_cluster_coordinates('fcc_cuboctahedron')\n    S6_fcc, S12_fcc = compute_geometric_sums(coords_fcc_0)\n    E_fcc_min = -S6_fcc**2 / S12_fcc\n\n    # 1.

Force and Acceleration Derivation\n\nThe system dynamics are governed by Newton's second law, $\\mathbf{F}_i = m \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i$, where the force $\\mathbf{F}_i$ on particle $i$ is conservative and thus derivable from a total potential energy $U$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_i = - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} U\n$$\nThe total potential energy $U$ is the sum of pairwise potentials $V(r_{ij})$ over all unique pairs of particles $(i, j)$ with $i  j$.\n$$\nU = \\sum_{ij} V(r_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i \\neq j} V(r_{ij})\n$$\nThe pairwise potential is given as a soft-core inverse-distance potential:\n$$\nV(r_{ij}) = \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{r_{ij}^2 + s^2}} = C (r_{ij}^2 + s^2)^{-1/2}\n$$\nwhere $r_{ij} = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j \\rVert$ is the Euclidean distance between particles $i$ and $j$.\n\nTo find the force on a specific particle, say particle $k$, we compute the gradient of $U$ with respect to $\\mathbf{r}_k$. The only terms in the sum for $U$ that depend on $\\mathbf{r}_k$ are those where one of the indices is $k$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_k = - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_k} \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq k} V(r_{kj}) \\right) = - \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_k} V(r_{kj})\n$$\nWe apply the chain rule for the gradient: $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_k} V(r_{kj}) = \\frac{dV}{dr_{kj}} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_k} r_{kj}$.\nThe gradient of the distance function is $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_k} r_{kj} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_k} \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_j \\rVert = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_j}{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_j \\rVert} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{kj}}{r_{kj}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{kj}$.\nThe derivative of the potential with respect to distance is:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dr} = C \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (r^2 + s^2)^{-3/2} (2r) = -C \\frac{r}{(r^2 + s^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\nCombining these results, the force exerted on particle $k$ by particle $j$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{kj} = -\\left( -C \\frac{r_{kj}}{(r_{kj}^2 + s^2)^{3/2}} \\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{kj} = C \\frac{r_{kj}}{(r_{kj}^2 + s^2)^{3/2}} \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{kj}}{r_{kj}} = C \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_j}{(\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_j \\rVert^2 + s^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\nThe total force on particle $k$ is the vector sum of forces from all other particles:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_k = \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\mathbf{F}_{kj} = C \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_j}{(\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_j \\rVert^2 + s^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\nFrom this, the acceleration of particle $k$ is given by $\\mathbf{a}_k = \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_k = \\mathbf{F}_k / m$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_k(t) = \\frac{C}{m} \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k(t) - \\mathbf{r}_j(t)}{(\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_k(t) - \\mathbf{r}_j(t) \\rVert^2 + s^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\nThis expression is used to compute accelerations at each time step.\n\n### 2. Numerical Integration: Velocity Verlet Scheme\n\nThe problem demands a second-order accurate, time-reversible integrator. The velocity Verlet algorithm satisfies these requirements. The algorithm advances the system state $(\\mathbf{r}(t), \\mathbf{v}(t))$ to $(\\mathbf{r}(t+\\Delta t), \\mathbf{v}(t+\\Delta t))$. Given positions $\\mathbf{r}_n = \\mathbf{r}(t_n)$, velocities $\\mathbf{v}_n = \\mathbf{v}(t_n)$, and accelerations $\\mathbf{a}_n = \\mathbf{a}(t_n)$, the state at the next time step $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$ is computed as follows:\n\n1.  **Position Update:** First, the positions are advanced over the full time step $\\Delta t$ using the current velocities and accelerations.\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{r}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{r}_n + \\mathbf{v}_n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{a}_n \\Delta t^2\n    $$\n2.  **Force/Acceleration Update:** The forces, and thus accelerations $\\mathbf{a}_{n+1}$, are calculated using the newly computed positions $\\mathbf{r}_{n+1}$.\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{a}_{n+1} = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}_{n+1})}{m}\n    $$\n3.  **Velocity Update:** Finally, the velocities are updated using an average of the old and new accelerations.\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{v}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{v}_n + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{a}_n + \\mathbf{a}_{n+1})\\Delta t\n    $$\nThis scheme is numerically stable for appropriate $\\Delta t$ and conserves energy for conservative systems over long periods with an error proportional to $\\Delta t^2$. For the implementation, we use an equivalent but computationally more convenient \"leapfrog\" variant:\n\n1.  Calculate a half-step velocity: $\\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2} = \\mathbf{v}_n + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{a}_n \\Delta t$.\n2.  Update positions fully: $\\mathbf{r}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{r}_n + \\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2} \\Delta t$.\n3.  (Apply boundary conditions to $\\mathbf{r}_{n+1}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}$).\n4.  Calculate new accelerations $\\mathbf{a}_{n+1}$ using $\\mathbf{r}_{n+1}$.\n5.  Complete the velocity update: $\\mathbf{v}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{a}_{n+1} \\Delta t$.\n\n### 3. Boundary Conditions: Specular Reflection\n\nThe particles are confined to a cubic box $[0, L]^3$. When a particle's trajectory crosses a boundary, it undergoes a specular (perfectly elastic) reflection. This is an instantaneous event that inverts the component of the particle's velocity normal to the wall, while its position is reflected back into the domain. This process conserves the particle's kinetic energy.\n\nThe reflection logic must be applied within the integration step. After the position update (step 2 of the leapfrog Verlet), we check each particle's new position for each coordinate axis $d \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$. Let $r_{i,d}$ be the $d$-component of particle $i$'s position and $v_{i,d}$ be the corresponding velocity component.\n\n-   If $r_{i,d}  0$: The particle has crossed the lower boundary. We reflect its position to $r_{i,d}' = -r_{i,d}$ and invert its velocity component $v_{i,d}' = -v_{i,d}$.\n-   If $r_{i,d}  L$: The particle has crossed the upper boundary. We reflect its position to $r_{i,d}' = 2L - r_{i,d}$ and invert its velocity component $v_{i,d}' = -v_{i,d}$.\n\nThis procedure must be applied repeatedly within a single time step if a particle's trial position is so far outside the box that its first reflection still leaves it outside (e.g., $r_{i,d}  -L$ or $r_{i,d}  2L$). A `while` loop is used to ensure the final position is strictly within $[0, L]^3$. Each velocity inversion event is counted as one reflection for Test $4$. This reflection is applied to the half-step velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}$ before it is used to compute the final velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{n+1}$.\n\n### 4. Total Energy\n\nThe total energy $E$ of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy $K$ and the potential energy $U$.\n$$\nE = K + U = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2} m \\lVert \\mathbf{v}_i \\rVert^2 + \\sum_{ij} \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j \\rVert^2 + s^2}}\n$$\nFor a conservative system, $E$ must be constant. The numerical integrator introduces a small error, so we expect $E$ to be approximately conserved. In Test $2$, no wall collisions occur, so any change in $E$ is due to the integrator's discretization error. The absolute relative energy error is calculated as $\\left|E(T) - E(0)\\right| / |E(0)|$. Note that $E(0) = U(0)$ since initial velocities are zero, and $U(0)  0$.\n\n### 5. Simulation Algorithm\n\nThe overall simulation proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Initialization**: Set particle positions $\\mathbf{r}_0$ and velocities $\\mathbf{v}_0$ according to the test case. Set time $t = 0$. Initialize reflection counter to $0$.\n2.  **Initial Force Calculation**: Compute initial accelerations $\\mathbf{a}_0$ from $\\mathbf{r}_0$.\n3.  **Time Evolution Loop**: For each time step from $n=0$ to $N_{\\text{steps}}-1$:\n    a. Update positions and half-step velocities using the Velocity Verlet scheme.\n    b. Apply specular reflection boundary conditions, updating positions, half-step velocities, and the reflection counter as necessary.\n    c. Calculate new accelerations from the final positions of the step.\n    d. Update the full-step velocities to complete the integration step.\n4.  **Final Result**: After the loop finishes at time $T$, extract the required observable (final distance, energy error, final velocity, or total reflection count).\n\nThis procedure is deterministic and, when implemented correctly with the specified parameters and initial conditions, will yield the unique results demanded by the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# from scipy import ...

The cumulants, which are the mean $\\langle x \\rangle$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(x)$, can be obtained by differentiation.\nThe first cumulant is the mean value $\\langle x \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle x \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P^*} \\ln I(P^*)\n$$\nThe second cumulant is the variance $\\mathrm{Var}(x) = \\langle x^2 \\rangle - \\langle x \\rangle^2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(x) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial (P^*)^2} \\ln I(P^*) = -\\frac{\\partial \\langle x \\rangle}{\\partial P^*}\n$$\nFirst, we compute $\\ln I(P^*)$:\n$$\n\\ln I(P^*) = -\\ln P^* + \\ln \\left( e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*} - (e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1)e^{-P^*\\lambda} \\right)\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $P^*$ to find $\\langle x \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle x \\rangle = -\\left[ -\\frac{1}{P^*} + \\frac{-e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*} - (e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1)(-\\lambda)e^{-P^*\\lambda}}{e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*} - (e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1)e^{-P^*\\lambda}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{P^*} + \\frac{e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*} - \\lambda(e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1)e^{-P^*\\lambda}}{e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*} - (e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1)e^{-P^*\\lambda}}\n$$\nTo find the variance, we differentiate $\\langle x \\rangle$ with respect to $P^*$ and take the negative. Let $D_0 = e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*} - (e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1)e^{-P^*\\lambda}$. Then $\\langle x \\rangle = 1/P^* + N_1/D_0$, where $N_1 = e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*} - \\lambda(e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1)e^{-P^*\\lambda}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(x) = -\\frac{\\partial \\langle x \\rangle}{\\partial P^*} = -\\left(-\\frac{1}{(P^*)^2} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P^*}\\left(\\frac{N_1}{D_0}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{(P^*)^2} - \\frac{N_1'D_0 - N_1D_0'}{D_0^2}\n$$\nAfter performing the differentiation and considerable algebraic simplification, the numerator of the fraction becomes:\n$$\nN_1'D_0 - N_1D_0' = (\\lambda - 1)^2 (e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1) e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*(1+\\lambda)}\n$$\nThis gives the final expression for the variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(x) = \\frac{1}{(P^*)^2} - \\frac{(\\lambda-1)^2 (e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1) e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*(1+\\lambda)}}{\\left(e^{\\varepsilon^*-P^*} - (e^{\\varepsilon^*}-1)e^{-P^*\\lambda}\\right)^2}\n$$\nThe required observables are related to these moments. The reduced number density is $\\rho^\\ast = \\rho\\sigma$. Since number density $\\rho=1/\\langle r \\rangle$, we have $\\rho^\\ast = \\sigma/\\langle r \\rangle = \\sigma/(\\sigma\\langle x \\rangle) = 1/\\langle x \\rangle$. The zero-wavenumber static structure factor for this one-dimensional system is $S(0) = \\mathrm{Var}(r)/\\langle r \\rangle^2 = \\sigma^2 \\mathrm{Var}(x) / (\\sigma^2 \\langle x \\rangle^2) = \\mathrm{Var}(x)/\\langle x \\rangle^2$.\n\nWith these analytical expressions, we can now compute the values for each test case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for reduced density and static structure factor for a 1D square-well fluid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test suite: each case is specified by (beta*epsilon, lambda, beta*P*sigma)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: (beta_eps, lambda, beta_P_sigma)\n        (0.0, 1.5, 1.0),\n        # Case B\n        (1.0, 1.5, 1.0),\n        # Case C\n        (3.0, 1.5, 1.0),\n        # Case D\n        (1.0, 2.0, 1.0),\n        # Case E\n        (1.0, 1.5, 0.1),\n        # Case F\n        (1.0, 1.5, 10.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        eps_star, lam, p_star = case\n\n        # For the case eps_star == 0, the model simplifies to a hard-rod fluid.\n        if eps_star == 0.0:\n            mean_x = 1.0 / p_star + 1.0\n            var_x = 1.0 / p_star**2\n        else:\n            # Numerically stable calculation using np.expm1(x) for exp(x) - 1\n            exp_eps_star_m1 = np.expm1(eps_star)\n            \n            # Common terms in the expressions\n            term_A = np.exp(eps_star - p_star)\n            term_B = exp_eps_star_m1 * np.exp(-p_star * lam)\n\n            # Denominator D_0\n            D0 = term_A - term_B\n            \n            # Calculate mean of dimensionless separation x\n            mean_x_numerator = term_A - lam * term_B\n            mean_x = 1.0 / p_star + mean_x_numerator / D0\n            \n            # Calculate variance of dimensionless separation Var(x)\n            var_x_frac_numerator = (lam - 1.0)**2 * exp_eps_star_m1 * np.exp(eps_star - p_star * (1.0 + lam))\n            var_x = (1.0 / p_star**2) - (var_x_frac_numerator / D0**2)\n\n        # Calculate final observables\n        # rho_star = sigma / r = 1 / x\n        rho_star = 1.0 / mean_x\n        # S(0) = Var(r) / r^2 = Var(x) / x^2\n        s0 = var_x / mean_x**2\n\n        # Round to six decimal places as required\n        results.append([round(rho_star, 6), round(s0, 6)])\n\n    # Format the output string\n    # E.g., [[0.5,0.25],[0.6,0.2],...]\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join([f\"[{r[0]:.6f},{r[1]:.6f}]\" for r in results]) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2423726"}]}
