The flow $f'_{uv}$ is updated according to the following rules:\n-   For each forward edge $(u,v)$ on $P$, we increase the flow: $f'_{uv} = f_{uv} + \\Delta$.\n-   For each reverse edge $(u,v)$ on $P$ (where $(v,u) \\in E$), we decrease the flow on the original edge: $f'_{vu} = f_{vu} - \\Delta$.\n\nApplying these rules:\n-   For $(s,c)$: $f'_{sc} = f_{sc} + \\Delta = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n-   For $(c,b)$: $f'_{cb} = f_{cb} + \\Delta = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n-   For $(b,a)$, the original edge is $(a,b)$: $f'_{ab} = f_{ab} - \\Delta = 2 - 2 = 0$.\n-   For $(a,t)$: $f'_{at} = f_{at} + \\Delta = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFlows on edges not part of the augmenting path remain unchanged:\n-   $f'_{sa} = f_{sa} = 3$.\n-   $f'_{bt} = f_{bt} = 4$.\n\nThis completes the second part of Task 1.\n\nFor Task 2, we compute the updated residual capacities for the specified pairs using the new flow $f'$.\n-   $(s,c)$: A forward edge. $c_{f'}(s,c) = c_{sc} - f'_{sc} = 5 - 4 = 1$.\n-   $(c,b)$: A forward edge. $c_{f'}(c,b) = c_{cb} - f'_{cb} = 4 - 4 = 0$.\n-   $(a,b)$: A forward edge. $c_{f'}(a,b) = c_{ab} - f'_{ab} = 3 - 0 = 3$.\n-   $(b,a)$: A reverse edge. $c_{f'}(b,a) = f'_{ab} = 0$.\n-   $(a,t)$: A forward edge. $c_{f'}(a,t) = c_{at} - f'_{at} = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\nFor Task 3, we verify skew symmetry $f'_{uv} = -f'_{vu}$ for an ordered pair. Let's use $(a,b)$.\nFrom our update, we have $f'_{ab} = 0$.\nBy the definition of skew symmetry, $f'_{ba}$ must be $-f'_{ab}$.\nTherefore, $f'_{ba} = -0 = 0$. Let's verify this using the augmentation rules on the reverse flow. The initial reverse flow was $f_{ba} = -f_{ab} = -2$. The path segment $b \\to a$ is a forward segment in the residual graph, so flow is added in this direction. A flow push of $\\Delta$ from $b$ to $a$ is equivalent to adding $\\Delta$ to $f_{ba}$.\n$f'_{ba} = f_{ba} + \\Delta = -2 + 2 = 0$.\nThe results are consistent, and skew symmetry holds: $f'_{ab} = 0$ and $f'_{ba}=0$.\n\nFor Task 4, we report the resulting value of the flow from $s$ to $t$. The value of the flow, $|f'|$, is the total net flow out of the source $s$:\n$$|f'| = \\sum_{v \\in V} f'_{sv}$$\nThe only vertices $v$ for which $f'_{sv}$ can be non-zero are $a$ and $c$, as $(s,a)$ and $(s,c)$ are the only outgoing edges from $s$.\n$$|f'| = f'_{sa} + f'_{sc}$$\nSubstituting the updated flow values:\n$$|f'| = 3 + 4 = 7$$\nAs a check, we can compute the total net flow into the sink $t$:\n$$|f'| = \\sum_{v \\in V} f'_{vt} = f'_{at} + f'_{bt} = 3 + 4 = 7$$\nThe values match. The flow value after the single augmentation is $7$. The initial flow value was $|f| = f_{sa} + f_{sc} = 3+2=5$. The new flow value is $|f'| = |f| + \\Delta = 5+2=7$, which is consistent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "3148815"}, {"introduction": "This practice transitions from manual computation to algorithmic implementation, bridging theory with empirical validation.

You must implement the Ford–Fulkerson method using the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest augmenting paths in terms of number of edges.\n\nUse the following network:\n- Vertices: $V = \\{s,a,b,c,t\\}$.\n- Directed edges and capacities:\n  - $(s,a)$ with capacity $4$.\n  - $(s,b)$ with capacity $3$.\n  - $(a,c)$ with capacity $100$.\n  - $(b,c)$ with capacity $100$.\n  - $(c,t)$ with capacity $5$.\n\nInterpret any edge not listed above as having capacity $0$. When a test case specifies an increase on such an edge, it effectively adds that edge to the network.\n\nImplement a program that:\n1. Computes the baseline maximum $s$–$t$ flow on the given network.\n2. Applies each of the following capacity increases to the base network independently and recomputes the maximum flow value:\n   - Test $1$: Increase $(a,c)$ by $50$.\n   - Test $2$: Increase $(s,a)$ by $10$.\n   - Test $3$: Increase $(a,c)$ by $50$ and $(b,c)$ by $200$.\n   - Test $4$: Increase $(c,t)$ by $1$.\n   - Test $5$: Increase $(c,t)$ by $100$.\n   - Test $6$: Increase $(a,b)$ by $100$ (note: this edge is absent initially, i.e., has capacity $0$).\n3. Produces the following final output on a single line as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets:\n   - The baseline maximum flow value as an integer.\n   - For Tests $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$, output a boolean indicating whether the new maximum flow equals the baseline value.\n   - For Tests $4$ and $5$, output the new maximum flow value as integers.\n\nTherefore, your program should output in the exact format:\n$[F_0,B_1,B_2,B_3,M_4,M_5,B_6]$,\nwhere $F_0$ is the baseline maximum flow, $B_i$ are booleans testing equality to the baseline for the specified tests, and $M_4$, $M_5$ are integers giving the new maximum flow values for Tests $4$ and $5$.\n\nNo user input is permitted.

Baseline Network Analysis**\n\nFirst, we analyze the base network to determine its maximum flow. The network has vertices $V = \\{s,a,b,c,t\\}$ and the following edges and capacities:\n- $(s,a)$ capacity 4\n- $(s,b)$ capacity 3\n- $(a,c)$ capacity 100\n- $(b,c)$ capacity 100\n- $(c,t)$ capacity 5\n\nThe max-flow min-cut theorem states that the maximum flow is equal to the capacity of the minimum $s-t$ cut. We examine the simple cuts in this network:\n- **Source cut:** $(S=\\{s\\}, T=\\{a,b,c,t\\})$. The capacity is $\\text{cap}(s,a) + \\text{cap}(s,b) = 4 + 3 = 7$.\n- **Sink cut:** $(S=\\{s,a,b,c\\}, T=\\{t\\})$. The capacity is $\\text{cap}(c,t) = 5$.\n- **Intermediate cut:** $(S=\\{s,a,b\\}, T=\\{c,t\\})$. The capacity is $\\text{cap}(a,c) + \\text{cap}(b,c) = 100 + 100 = 200$.\n\nThe minimum of these cut capacities is 5. Therefore, the baseline maximum flow ($F_0$) is 5. The minimum cut is formed by the single edge $(c,t)$.\n\n**2. Analysis of Test Cases**\n\nThe key insight from the max-flow min-cut theorem is that only increasing the capacity of an edge *in a minimum cut* can increase the maximum flow. An edge not in a minimum cut is not a system bottleneck.\n\n- **Test 1, 2, 3, and 6:** These tests modify edges $(a,c)$, $(s,a)$, $(b,c)$, or add edge $(a,b)$. None of these edges are part of the minimum cut defined by $\\{(c,t)\\}$. Thus, the max flow remains constrained by the capacity of $(c,t)$, which is 5. The new max flow will equal the baseline value. Therefore, $B_1, B_2, B_3, B_6$ are all `True`.\n\n- **Test 4:** The capacity of the bottleneck edge $(c,t)$ is increased by 1 to 6. The capacity of this cut becomes 6. The next smallest cut is the source cut, with capacity 7. The new bottleneck is thus 6. The maximum flow ($M_4$) will increase to 6.\n\n- **Test 5:** The capacity of $(c,t)$ is increased by 100 to 105. The capacity of the sink cut is now 105. The bottleneck shifts to the source cut, which has a capacity of $\\text{cap}(s,a) + \\text{cap}(s,b) = 4 + 3 = 7$. The new maximum flow ($M_5$) will be 7.\n\n**3. Implementation and Verification**\n\nTo computationally verify this analysis, we implement the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
