Northwest Corner (NW) Rule Allocation and Cost**\n\nThe Northwest Corner rule determines an initial basic feasible solution by allocating units starting from the top-left cell $(1,1)$ of the tableau, without regard to costs.\n\n- **Cell (1,1):** Allocate $x_{11} = \\min(s_1, d_1) = \\min(S, S-\\delta) = S-\\delta$.\n  The demand for destination $1$ is satisfied.

Optimal Allocation and Cost**\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we analyze the structure of the cost function. Let $Q_D = x_{11} + x_{22} + x_{33}$ be the total quantity shipped along the main diagonal (high-cost routes). The total quantity shipped is $\\sum_{i,j} x_{ij} = 3S$. The quantity shipped on off-diagonal routes is $3S - Q_D$. The total cost can be written as:\n$$\nZ = M \\sum_{i=j} x_{ij} + \\varepsilon \\sum_{i \\ne j} x_{ij} = M Q_D + \\varepsilon (3S - Q_D)\n$$\n$$\nZ = (M - \\varepsilon) Q_D + 3S\\varepsilon\n$$\nSince $M > \\varepsilon$, the term $(M-\\varepsilon)$ is positive. Therefore, to minimize the total cost $Z$, one must minimize $Q_D$, the total flow on the high-cost diagonal routes. Since all $x_{ij} \\ge 0$, the minimum possible value for $Q_D$ is $0$.\n\nWe must verify that a feasible allocation exists with $Q_D = x_{11} + x_{22} + x_{33} = 0$. This requires finding a feasible solution using only the off-diagonal cells (where cost is $\\varepsilon$). Let's construct such a solution, $x^\\star$.\nConsider the following allocation:\n$x^\\star_{12} = S-\\delta$\n$x^\\star_{13} = \\delta$\n$x^\\star_{23} = S$\n$x^\\star_{31} = S-\\delta$\n$x^\\star_{32} = \\delta$\nAll other $x^\\star_{ij}=0$, including the diagonal elements $x^\\star_{11}, x^\\star_{22}, x^\\star_{33}$.\n\nLet's check if this allocation is feasible:\n- Non-negativity: Since $0 < \\delta < S$, all allocated quantities are positive.\n- Supply constraints:\n  - Row 1: $x^\\star_{12} + x^\\star_{13} = (S-\\delta) + \\delta = S$. (Correct)\n  - Row 2: $x^\\star_{23} = S$. (Correct)\n  - Row 3: $x^\\star_{31} + x^\\star_{32} = (S-\\delta) + \\delta = S$. (Correct)\n- Demand constraints:\n  - Column 1: $x^\\star_{31} = S-\\delta$. (Correct)\n  - Column 2: $x^\\star_{12} + x^\\star_{32} = (S-\\delta) + \\delta = S$. (Correct)\n  - Column 3: $x^\\star_{13} + x^\\star_{23} = \\delta + S = S+\\delta$. (Correct)\n\nThe allocation $x^\\star$ is feasible and has $Q_D=0$. Therefore, it achieves the minimum possible cost. This is an optimal solution. The optimal cost, $Z(x^\\star)$, is:\n$$\nZ(x^\\star) = (M - \\varepsilon) (0) + 3S\\varepsilon = 3S\\varepsilon\n$$\n\n**3. Suboptimality Gap**\n\nThe additive suboptimality gap, $\\Delta Z$, is the difference between the cost of the NW allocation and the optimal cost.\n$$\n\\Delta Z = Z(x^{\\text{NW}}) - Z(x^\\star)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Z = \\left( M(3S - 2\\delta) + 2\\delta\\varepsilon \\right) - (3S\\varepsilon)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Z = 3SM - 2\\delta M + 2\\delta\\varepsilon - 3S\\varepsilon\n$$\nTo simplify, we group terms with $M$ and $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\Delta Z = (3SM - 3S\\varepsilon) - (2\\delta M - 2\\delta\\varepsilon)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Z = 3S(M - \\varepsilon) - 2\\delta(M - \\varepsilon)\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $(M-\\varepsilon)$ yields the final simplified expression:\n$$\n\\Delta Z = (3S - 2\\delta)(M - \\varepsilon)\n$$\nThis expression represents the exact additive suboptimality gap of the Northwest corner rule allocation for the given problem instance.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(3S - 2\\delta)(M - \\varepsilon)}\n$$", "id": "3193108"}, {"introduction": "Having established the need for a formal optimization method, we now delve into its inner workings.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the four parts requested in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Computation of Potentials and Reduced Costs**\n\nThe given Basic Feasible Solution (BFS) has basic variables corresponding to the cells $(1,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,2)$, and $(2,3)$. For these basic cells, the potentials $u_i$ and $v_j$ must satisfy the equality $c_{ij} = u_i + v_j$. This gives a system of $4$ equations with $5$ unknowns ($u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2, v_3$):\n- For $(1,1)$: $c_{11} = u_1 + v_1 \\implies 4 = u_1 + v_1$\n- For $(1,2)$: $c_{12} = u_1 + v_2 \\implies 3 = u_1 + v_2$\n- For $(2,2)$: $c_{22} = u_2 + v_2 \\implies 2 = u_2 + v_2$\n- For $(2,3)$: $c_{23} = u_2 + v_3 \\implies 0 = u_2 + v_3$\n\nThis system has one degree of freedom. We can set one potential arbitrarily. Let $u_1 = 0$.\n1.  From $3 = u_1 + v_2$, we get $3 = 0 + v_2 \\implies v_2 = 3$.\n2.  From $4 = u_1 + v_1$, we get $4 = 0 + v_1 \\implies v_1 = 4$.\n3.  From $2 = u_2 + v_2$, we get $2 = u_2 + 3 \\implies u_2 = -1$.\n4.  From $0 = u_2 + v_3$, we get $0 = -1 + v_3 \\implies v_3 = 1$.\n\nA valid set of potentials is $\\{u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2, v_3\\} = \\{0, -1, 4, 3, 1\\}$.\n\nNext, we compute the reduced costs $r_{ij} = c_{ij} - (u_i + v_j)$ for the non-basic cells, which are $(1,3)$ and $(2,1)$.\n- For $(1,3)$: $r_{13} = c_{13} - (u_1 + v_3) = 1 - (0 + 1) = 0$.\n- For $(2,1)$: $r_{21} = c_{21} - (u_2 + v_1) = 3 - (-1 + 4) = 3 - 3 = 0$.\n\nSince all reduced costs are non-negative ($r_{ij} \\geq 0$), the current BFS is optimal. Furthermore, we have found two non-basic positions, $(1,3)$ and $(2,1)$, which have tied reduced costs of $r_{ij}=0$. This indicates the existence of alternative optimal solutions.\n\n**2. Pivots for Two Alternative Optimal BFSs**\n\nWe can pivot by introducing either $x_{13}$ or $x_{21}$ into the basis. The objective function value will not change since their reduced costs are zero.\n\n**Pivot 1: Entering variable $x_{13}$**\nWe introduce $x_{13} = \\theta$ into the solution. To maintain the conservation constraints, we must adjust other basic variables. This forms a unique cycle in the transportation tableau involving the entering cell $(1,3)$ and some current basic cells. The cycle is $(1,3) \\to (2,3) \\to (2,2) \\to (1,2) \\to (1,3)$. We alternately add and subtract $\\theta$ around this loop:\n- $x_{13}' = x_{13} + \\theta = 0 + \\theta$\n- $x_{23}' = x_{23} - \\theta = 25 - \\theta$\n- $x_{22}' = x_{22} + \\theta = 5 + \\theta$\n- $x_{12}' = x_{12} - \\theta = 10 - \\theta$\nThe remaining basic variable $x_{11}$ is not in the cycle and remains unchanged. For the new solution to be feasible, all variables must be non-negative. This requires $25 - \\theta \\ge 0$ and $10 - \\theta \\ge 0$. The maximum permissible value for $\\theta$ is $\\theta = \\min(25, 10) = 10$.\nWith $\\theta=10$, the variable $x_{12}$ becomes $0$ and leaves the basis. The new optimal BFS, denoted $\\{x_{ij}'\\}$, is:\n- $x_{11}' = 10$\n- $x_{12}' = 0$ (non-basic)\n- $x_{13}' = 10$ (basic)\n- $x_{22}' = 5 + 10 = 15$\n- $x_{23}' = 25 - 10 = 15$\n- All other $x_{ij}'$ are zero. The new basic cells are $(1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)$.\n\n**Pivot 2: Entering variable $x_{21}$ (from the original BFS)**\nWe introduce $x_{21} = \\theta$ into the original solution. The cycle is $(2,1) \\to (1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to (2,2) \\to (2,1)$. We adjust variables:\n- $x_{21}'' = x_{21} + \\theta = 0 + \\theta$\n- $x_{11}'' = x_{11} - \\theta = 10 - \\theta$\n- $x_{12}'' = x_{12} + \\theta = 10 + \\theta$\n- $x_{22}'' = x_{22} - \\theta = 5 - \\theta$\nThe variable $x_{23}$ is not in the cycle and is unchanged. Feasibility requires $10 - \\theta \\ge 0$ and $5 - \\theta \\ge 0$. The maximum value is $\\theta = \\min(10, 5) = 5$.\nWith $\\theta=5$, the variable $x_{22}$ becomes $0$ and leaves the basis. The second new optimal BFS, denoted $\\{x_{ij}''\\}$, is:\n- $x_{11}'' = 10 - 5 = 5$\n- $x_{12}'' = 10 + 5 = 15$\n- $x_{21}'' = 5$ (basic)\n- $x_{22}'' = 0$ (non-basic)\n- $x_{23}'' = 25$\n- All other $x_{ij}''$ are zero. The new basic cells are $(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3)$.\n\n**3. Invariance of the Total Cost**\n\nThe total cost is $Z = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x_{ij}$. When we pivot to a new solution $\\{x'_{ij}\\}$ by introducing a non-basic variable $x_{kl}$ with flow $\\theta$, the change in cost is $\\Delta Z = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} (x'_{ij} - x_{ij})$. The only changes $\\Delta x_{ij} = x'_{ij} - x_{ij}$ are for variables in the cycle, where $\\Delta x_{ij}$ takes values $\\pm\\theta$ or $0$. Let the cycle be $(k,l), (k, m_1), (p_1, m_1), \\dots, (p_N, l)$. The change in cost is:\n$\\Delta Z = c_{kl}(\\theta) + c_{k m_1}(-\\theta) + c_{p_1 m_1}(\\theta) + \\dots = \\theta (c_{kl} - c_{k m_1} + c_{p_1 m_1} - \\dots)$\nThe cells other than $(k,l)$ in this cycle are basic, so their costs satisfy $c_{ij} = u_i + v_j$. Substituting these into the expression:\n$\\Delta Z = \\theta (c_{kl} - (u_k + v_{m_1}) + (u_{p_1} + v_{m_1}) - \\dots + (u_{p_N} + v_{l}))$.\nDue to the structure of the cycle, the potentials for the intermediate vertices cancel out in pairs (e.g., $-v_{m_1} + v_{m_1} = 0$). The expression telescopes to:\n$\\Delta Z = \\theta (c_{kl} - (u_k + v_l))$\nThe term $c_{kl} - (u_k + v_l)$ is by definition the reduced cost $r_{kl}$ of the entering variable. Thus, $\\Delta Z = \\theta \\cdot r_{kl}$.\n\nIn our pivots:\n- For Pivot 1, we introduced $x_{13}$ with $r_{13}=0$. The change in cost is $\\Delta Z = \\theta \\cdot r_{13} = 10 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- For Pivot 2, we introduced $x_{21}$ with $r_{21}=0$. The change in cost is $\\Delta Z = \\theta \\cdot r_{21} = 5 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\nIn both cases, the cost change is zero because the entering variable has a reduced cost of zero. This is a general principle: pivoting on a non-basic variable with zero reduced cost moves the solution to another BFS on the same optimal face of the feasible polytope, without changing the objective function value.\n\n**4. Optimal Objective Cost**\n\nSince the initial BFS is optimal, we can calculate the minimum total cost using its variable values: $x_{11}=10, x_{12}=10, x_{22}=5, x_{23}=25$.\nThe objective function value is:\n$$Z = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x_{ij} = c_{11}x_{11} + c_{12}x_{12} + c_{22}x_{22} + c_{23}x_{23}$$\nSubstituting the given costs and variable values:\n$$Z = (4)(10) + (3)(10) + (2)(5) + (0)(25)$$\n$$Z = 40 + 30 + 10 + 0 = 80$$\nThe optimal cost for this transportation problem is $80$. As a verification, we can compute the cost for the two alternative optimal solutions found in part 2, and they will also yield a total cost of $80$.\n- Cost of BFS 1: $Z' = (4)(10) + (1)(10) + (2)(15) + (0)(15) = 40 + 10 + 30 + 0 = 80$.\n- Cost of BFS 2: $Z'' = (4)(5) + (3)(15) + (3)(5) + (0)(25) = 20 + 45 + 15 + 0 = 80$.\nAll three solutions confirm the optimal cost.

Let $x_{ij}$ be the quantity of goods shipped from supply node $i$ to demand node $j$.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost $Z$:\n$$ \\text{Minimize } Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{2} c_{ij} x_{ij} $$\n$$ Z = 4x_{11} + (1+\\Delta c)x_{12} + 5x_{21} + 3x_{22} $$\n\nThis is subject to the following constraints:\n- Supply constraints (the total amount shipped from each supply node must equal its supply):\n$$ x_{11} + x_{12} = s_1 = 40 $$\n$$ x_{21} + x_{22} = s_2 = 60 $$\n- Demand constraints (the total amount received by each demand node must equal its demand):\n$$ x_{11} + x_{21} = d_1 = 50 $$\n$$ x_{12} + x_{22} = d_2 = 50 $$\n- Non-negativity constraints:\n$$ x_{11} \\ge 0, \\quad x_{12} \\ge 0, \\quad x_{21} \\ge 0, \\quad x_{22} \\ge 0 $$\n\n**2) Derivation of Conditions on $\\Delta c$**\nThe four equality constraints are not independent. Since the problem is balanced ($\\sum s_i = \\sum d_j$), one of the constraints is redundant. This leaves three independent constraints for four variables, implying that the feasible set has one degree of freedom. We can express all decision variables in terms of a single variable, for instance, $x_{11}$.\n\nFrom the first supply constraint:\n$$ x_{12} = 40 - x_{11} $$\nFrom the first demand constraint:\n$$ x_{21} = 50 - x_{11} $$\nUsing the second supply constraint and the expression for $x_{21}$:\n$$ x_{22} = 60 - x_{21} = 60 - (50 - x_{11}) = 10 + x_{11} $$\nWe can verify that these expressions satisfy the second demand constraint: $x_{12} + x_{22} = (40 - x_{11}) + (10 + x_{11}) = 50$, which is correct.\n\nNow, we enforce the non-negativity constraints on all variables to determine the feasible range for $x_{11}$:\n1.  $x_{11} \\ge 0$\n2.  $x_{12} = 40 - x_{11} \\ge 0 \\implies x_{11} \\le 40$\n3.  $x_{21} = 50 - x_{11} \\ge 0 \\implies x_{11} \\le 50$\n4.  $x_{22} = 10 + x_{11} \\ge 0 \\implies x_{11} \\ge -10$\n\nCombining these inequalities, the feasible range for $x_{11}$ is given by $\\max(0, -10) \\le x_{11} \\le \\min(40, 50)$, which simplifies to:\n$$ 0 \\le x_{11} \\le 40 $$\nThe minimum feasible value for $x_{11}$ is $0$, and the maximum feasible value is $40$. These correspond to two distinct basic feasible solutions (BFS).\n\nNext, we express the objective function $Z$ solely in terms of $x_{11}$:\n$$ Z(x_{11}) = 4x_{11} + (1+\\Delta c)(40 - x_{11}) + 5(50 - x_{11}) + 3(10 + x_{11}) $$\nExpanding and collecting terms involving $x_{11}$:\n$$ Z(x_{11}) = 4x_{11} + 40 - x_{11} + 40\\Delta c - x_{11}\\Delta c + 250 - 5x_{11} + 30 + 3x_{11} $$\n$$ Z(x_{11}) = (4 - 1 - \\Delta c - 5 + 3)x_{11} + (40 + 40\\Delta c + 250 + 30) $$\n$$ Z(x_{11}) = (1 - \\Delta c)x_{11} + (320 + 40\\Delta c) $$\nThe total cost $Z$ is a linear function of $x_{11}$ over the closed interval $[0, 40]$. The minimum of a linear function on an interval must occur at one of its endpoints.\n\n- The optimal solution places $x_{11}$ at its minimum feasible value ($x_{11}=0$) if the slope of $Z(x_{11})$ is positive.\n  Condition: $1 - \\Delta c > 0 \\implies \\Delta c < 1$.\n  In this case, the optimal solution is $x_{11}=0, x_{12}=40, x_{21}=50, x_{22}=10$.\n\n- The optimal solution places $x_{11}$ at its maximum feasible value ($x_{11}=40$) if the slope of $Z(x_{11})$ is negative.\n  Condition: $1 - \\Delta c < 0 \\implies \\Delta c > 1$.\n  In this case, the optimal solution is $x_{11}=40, x_{12}=0, x_{21}=10, x_{22}=50$.\n\n- If the slope is zero, any feasible value of $x_{11}$ in the range $[0, 40]$ is optimal.\n  Condition: $1 - \\Delta c = 0 \\implies \\Delta c = 1$.\n  In this case, both extreme solutions are optimal, as is any convex combination of them.\n\n**3) Determination of the Threshold Parameter $\\Delta c^\\star$**\nThe threshold value, $\\Delta c^\\star$, is the point at which the optimal shipment pattern switches between the two extreme cases. This occurs when the cost function is indifferent to the choice of $x_{11}$ within its feasible range, which happens when the coefficient of $x_{11}$ in the objective function $Z(x_{11})$ is zero. This point represents the boundary between the two regions of optimality for the two basic feasible solutions.\n\nSetting the slope to zero:\n$$ 1 - \\Delta c = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta c^\\star = 1 $$\nWhen $\\Delta c = 1$, the costs of the two extreme solutions are equal.\nCost with $x_{11}=0$: $Z(0) = (1-1)(0) + (320 + 40(1)) = 360$.\nCost with $x_{11}=40$: $Z(40) = (1-1)(40) + (320 + 40(1)) = 360$.\n\nFor $\\Delta c < 1$, the solution with $x_{11}=0$ is cheaper. For $\\Delta c > 1$, the solution with $x_{11}=40$ is cheaper. The switch occurs at $\\Delta c = 1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3193061"}]}
