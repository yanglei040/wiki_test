The complete vector of variables is $x = [x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2]^T$. The cost vector is $c = [5, 3, 4, 0, 0]^T$. The constraint matrix $A$ and the right-hand-side vector $b$ are:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad b = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 12 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the current basis consists of the columns associated with variables $x_1$ and $x_3$. We partition the variables, costs, and matrix $A$ into basic and nonbasic components. The set of basic variable indices is $\\mathcal{B} = \\{1, 3\\}$, and the set of nonbasic variable indices is $\\mathcal{N} = \\{2, 4, 5\\}$, corresponding to variables $x_2, s_1, s_2$.\n\nThe basic variables are $x_B = [x_1, x_3]^T$, and the nonbasic variables are $x_N = [x_2, s_1, s_2]^T$.\nThe basis matrix $B$ is formed by the columns of $A$ corresponding to the basic variables:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe nonbasic matrix $N$ is formed by the columns of $A$ for the nonbasic variables:\n$$\nN = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe cost vector is partitioned similarly into $c_B = [5, 4]^T$ and $c_N = [3, 0, 0]^T$.\n\nWith the nonbasic variables set to zero ($x_N=0$), the system of constraints $Ax=b$ reduces to $Bx_B = b$. The current basic solution is $x_B = B^{-1}b$.\nThe inverse of the basis matrix $B$ is:\n$$\nB^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(2)(3) - (1)(1)} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5} & -\\frac{1}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe values of the basic variables are:\n$$\nx_B = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5} & -\\frac{1}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 12 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{24}{5} - \\frac{12}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{24}{5} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{12}{5} \\\\ \\frac{16}{5} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nSince $x_1 = 12/5 \\ge 0$ and $x_3 = 16/5 \\ge 0$, this is a basic feasible solution.\n\n**1. Computation of the Dual Price Vector**\n\nThe dual price vector (or vector of simplex multipliers) $y = [y_1, y_2]^T$ is defined by the condition that the reduced costs of the basic variables are zero. This leads to the equation:\n$$\ny^T B = c_B^T.\n$$\nSubstituting the matrices $B$ and $c_B^T$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 & y_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis gives the following system of linear equations:\n$$\n2y_1 + y_2 = 5\n$$\n$$\ny_1 + 3y_2 = 4\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we express $y_1$ as $y_1 = 4 - 3y_2$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\n2(4 - 3y_2) + y_2 = 5\n$$\n$$\n8 - 6y_2 + y_2 = 5\n$$\n$$\n8 - 5y_2 = 5 \\implies 5y_2 = 3 \\implies y_2 = \\frac{3}{5}.\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $y_2$ back into the expression for $y_1$:\n$$\ny_1 = 4 - 3\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = 4 - \\frac{9}{5} = \\frac{20 - 9}{5} = \\frac{11}{5}.\n$$\nThus, the dual price vector is $y = [\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{3}{5}]^T$.\n\n**2. Interpretation of the Dual Prices**\n\nThe components of the dual vector $y$ are the shadow prices associated with the constraints. The objective function value at a basic feasible solution is $z = c_B^T x_B$. Since $x_B = B^{-1}b$, we can write $z = c_B^T B^{-1} b$. From the definition $y^T = c_B^T B^{-1}$, we have $z = y^T b = \\sum_i y_i b_i$.\nThe derivative of the objective function value with respect to the $i$-th right-hand-side resource value $b_i$ is $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial b_i} = y_i$, assuming the basis remains optimal.\nTherefore, $y_1 = \\frac{11}{5}$ is the marginal value of the first resource. If the right-hand-side of the first constraint were to increase from $8$ to $9$, the optimal objective value would be expected to increase by $\\frac{11}{5} = 2.2$.\nSimilarly, $y_2 = \\frac{3}{5}$ is the marginal value of the second resource. A one-unit increase in the second resource, from $12$ to $13$, would be expected to increase the optimal objective value by $\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$.\n\n**3. Computation and Verification of the Reduced Cost $\\bar{c}_2$**\n\nThe reduced cost $\\bar{c}_j$ for a nonbasic variable $x_j$ is defined as the rate of change of the objective function per unit increase of $x_j$. It is calculated by the formula:\n$$\n\\bar{c}_j = c_j - y^T A_j\n$$\nwhere $A_j$ is the column of the original matrix $A$ corresponding to $x_j$. For the nonbasic variable $x_2$ (where $j=2$), we have $c_2 = 3$ and $A_2 = [1, 2]^T$.\nUsing the calculated dual vector $y$:\n$$\n\\bar{c}_2 = 3 - \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{11}{5} & \\frac{3}{5} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 3 - \\left( \\frac{11}{5} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 2 \\right) = 3 - \\left( \\frac{11}{5} + \\frac{6}{5} \\right) = 3 - \\frac{17}{5}.\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{c}_2 = \\frac{15}{5} - \\frac{17}{5} = -\\frac{2}{5}.\n$$\nNow, we verify this value by analyzing the marginal net gain. Let us increase the nonbasic variable $x_2$ by a small amount $\\epsilon > 0$, while the other nonbasic variables $s_1$ and $s_2$ remain at $0$. To maintain feasibility, the basic variables $x_B$ must adjust. The constraint system $Bx_B + Nx_N = b$ becomes $Bx_B + A_2 x_2 = b$.\nThe new vector of basic variables, $x_B(\\epsilon)$, is given by:\n$$\nx_B(\\epsilon) = B^{-1}(b - A_2 \\epsilon) = B^{-1}b - B^{-1}A_2 \\epsilon = x_B(0) - (B^{-1}A_2)\\epsilon.\n$$\nThe vector $d = B^{-1}A_2$ represents how the basic variables must change. Let's compute it:\n$$\nd = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5} & -\\frac{1}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{5} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nSo, $\\Delta x_B = -d\\epsilon$, which means $\\Delta x_1 = -\\frac{1}{5}\\epsilon$ and $\\Delta x_3 = -\\frac{3}{5}\\epsilon$. For every unit increase in $x_2$, $x_1$ must decrease by $\\frac{1}{5}$ units and $x_3$ must decrease by $\\frac{3}{5}$ units to satisfy the constraints.\n\nThe change in the objective function, $\\Delta z$, is the sum of the direct gain from increasing $x_2$ and the indirect loss from adjusting $x_B$:\n$$\n\\Delta z = c_2 \\epsilon + c_B^T \\Delta x_B = c_2 \\epsilon + c_B^T (-d \\epsilon) = (c_2 - c_B^T d)\\epsilon.\n$$\nThe marginal net gain is $\\frac{\\Delta z}{\\epsilon} = c_2 - c_B^T d$. Let's compute this value:\n$$\nc_B^T d = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{5} \\end{pmatrix} = 5\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + 4\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{12}{5} = \\frac{5+12}{5} = \\frac{17}{5}.\n$$\nThis value, $\\frac{17}{5}$, represents the cost incurred by adjusting the basic variables for a unit increase in $x_2$.\nThe direct gain from a unit increase in $x_2$ is $c_2 = 3 = \\frac{15}{5}$.\nThe marginal net gain is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta z}{\\epsilon} = c_2 - c_B^T d = 3 - \\frac{17}{5} = \\frac{15 - 17}{5} = -\\frac{2}{5}.\n$$\nThis result confirms that the reduced cost $\\bar{c}_2 = -\\frac{2}{5}$ is indeed the marginal net gain of increasing $x_2$ by one unit. A negative reduced cost in a maximization problem indicates that increasing the corresponding nonbasic variable will decrease the objective function value.\n\n**4.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the relationship between numerical uncertainty and the choice of a tolerance parameter.\n\n**Principle of Tolerance Selection**\nThe purpose of a tolerance $\\tau$ is to create a \"zero-region\" around $0$ to account for floating-point errors. A computed value $\\bar{c}_j$ falling inside this region (i.e., $|\\bar{c}_j| < \\tau$) cannot be reliably distinguished from zero. To ensure that numerical noise is not mistaken for a significant value, the tolerance $\\tau$ must be chosen to be at least as large as the maximum possible absolute uncertainty, which we will denote as $\\epsilon$.\nIn this problem, the uncertainty is given as $|\\Delta \\bar{c}_j| \\le \\epsilon = 7 \\times 10^{-4}$. Therefore, a consistent and robust choice of tolerance must satisfy $\\tau \\ge 7 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\n**Analysis of True Values**\nLet's analyze the possible range of the true reduced costs, $\\bar{c}_j^{\\text{true}}$, given the computed values $\\bar{c}_j^{\\text{comp}}$ and the uncertainty $\\epsilon = 7 \\times 10^{-4}$. The true value lies in the interval $[\\bar{c}_j^{\\text{comp}} - \\epsilon, \\bar{c}_j^{\\text{comp}} + \\epsilon]$.\n- For $x_3$: $\\bar{c}_3^{\\text{true}} \\in [0.00007 - 0.0007, 0.00007 + 0.0007] = [-0.00063, 0.00077]$. This interval contains $0$. We cannot be certain that the true reduced cost is positive. Thus, $x_3$ is not a reliable candidate to enter the basis.\n- For $x_4$: $\\bar{c}_4^{\\text{true}} \\in [0.00970 - 0.0007, 0.00970 + 0.0007] = [0.00900, 0.01040]$. This interval is strictly positive. We are certain that the true reduced cost is positive. Therefore, the current solution is not optimal, and $x_4$ is an eligible variable to enter the basis.\n- For $x_5$: $\\bar{c}_5^{\\text{true}} \\in [-0.00006 - 0.0007, -0.00006 + 0.0007] = [-0.00076, 0.00064]$. This interval contains $0$. We cannot be certain that the true reduced cost is non-positive. However, since we are in a maximization context, we only consider variables with positive reduced costs to enter the basis.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, the correct conclusion is that the current solution is not optimal, and $x_4$ is the only nonbasic variable that should be considered for entering the basis. We will now evaluate each option against this benchmark.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe entering variable rule is to select $x_j$ if its computed reduced cost satisfies $\\bar{c}_j > \\tau$.\n\n**A. Choose $\\tau = 10^{-8}$; the current solution is not optimal; $x_3$ and $x_4$ are eligible to enter.**\n- **Tolerance Consistency**: The choice $\\tau = 10^{-8}$ is not consistent with the uncertainty bound $\\epsilon = 7 \\times 10^{-4}$, as $10^{-8} \\ll 7 \\times 10^{-4}$. Such a small tolerance would fail to filter out numerical noise and would treat values that could be zero as significant.\n- **Rule Application**:\n    - For $x_3$: $\\bar{c}_3 = 0.00007 > 10^{-8}$. The rule would make $x_3$ eligible.\n    - For $x_4$: $\\bar{c}_4 = 0.00970 > 10^{-8}$. The rule would make $x_4$ eligible.\nThis application incorrectly identifies $x_3$ as an eligible variable, as its true value could be zero or negative.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The proposed tolerance is inconsistent with the stated uncertainty, and its application leads to an incorrect set of eligible variables.\n\n**B. Choose $\\tau = 10^{-4}$; the current solution is not optimal; $x_4$ is the only eligible entering variable.**\n- **Tolerance Consistency**: The choice $\\tau = 10^{-4} = 0.0001$ is not consistent. It is smaller than the uncertainty bound $\\epsilon = 7 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.0007$. A computed value of, for instance, $\\bar{c}_j = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$ could be due to roundoff from a true value of $0$, but since $5 \\times 10^{-4} > \\tau$, this rule would incorrectly select $x_j$ as an entering variable. The tolerance choice is not robust.\n- **Rule Application**:\n    - For $x_3$: $\\bar{c}_3 = 0.00007 \\ngtr 10^{-4}$. The rule would not make $x_3$ eligible.\n    - For $x_4$: $\\bar{c}_4 = 0.00970 > 10^{-4}$. The rule would make $x_4$ eligible.\nWhile the conclusion about the entering variable happens to be correct for these specific data points, the premise (the choice of $\\tau$) is flawed from a numerical stability standpoint. The question asks for an option that *both* proposes a consistent tolerance *and* correctly applies the rule. This option fails the first criterion.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The proposed tolerance is not consistent with the stated uncertainty.\n\n**C. Choose $\\tau = 10^{-3}$; the current solution is not optimal; $x_4$ is the only eligible entering variable.**\n- **Tolerance Consistency**: The choice $\\tau = 10^{-3} = 0.001$ is consistent with the uncertainty bound $\\epsilon = 7 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.0007$, as $10^{-3} > 7 \\times 10^{-4}$. This tolerance provides a safe margin to account for the numerical error.\n- **Rule Application**:\n    - For $x_3$: $\\bar{c}_3 = 0.00007 \\ngtr 10^{-3}$. The rule correctly does not make $x_3$ eligible. Its computed value falls well within the tolerance band ($|\\bar{c}_3| < \\tau$).\n    - For $x_4$: $\\bar{c}_4 = 0.00970 > 10^{-3}$. The rule correctly makes $x_4$ eligible. Its computed value is significantly larger than the tolerance.\n    - For $x_5$: $\\bar{c}_5 = -0.00006 \\ngtr 10^{-3}$. The rule correctly does not make $x_5$ eligible.\nThe application of this rule leads to the conclusion that the solution is not optimal and that $x_4$ is the sole eligible entering variable. This matches our rigorous analysis.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. The proposed tolerance is consistent with the uncertainty, and its application correctly identifies the optimality status and the set of eligible entering variables.\n\n**D. Choose $\\tau = 10^{-2}$; declare the current solution optimal; no variable is eligible to enter.**\n- **Tolerance Consistency**: The choice $\\tau = 10^{-2} = 0.01$ is consistent in the sense that $\\tau > \\epsilon$ ($10^{-2} > 7 \\times 10^{-4}$). It is a safe choice.\n- **Rule Application**:\n    - For $x_3$: $\\bar{c}_3 = 0.00007 \\ngtr 10^{-2}$. Not eligible.\n    - For $x_4$: $\\bar{c}_4 = 0.00970 \\ngtr 10^{-2}$. Not eligible.\n    - For $x_5$: $\\bar{c}_5 = -0.00006 \\ngtr 10^{-2}$. Not eligible.\nThe rule application leads to the conclusion that no variable is eligible to enter, and thus the current solution is declared optimal. This is an incorrect conclusion. We know with certainty that the true $\\bar{c}_4$ is positive (at least $0.009$). A tolerance should not be so large that it masks a clear, significant signal for improvement. This choice of $\\tau$ is overly conservative, leading to premature termination of the simplex algorithm at a suboptimal solution. Thus, the rule is not \"correctly applied\" in the sense of achieving the goal of optimization.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. Although the tolerance is technically consistent (safe), it is inappropriately large, leading to an incorrect conclusion about optimality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "3171526"}]}
