Therefore, no transformation is needed.\n\n**Step 2: Standardize the Sign Restrictions**\nThe standard form requires all variables to be non-negative. We will introduce new variables to replace those that do not meet this criterion.\n\n- The variables $x_1$ and $x_4$ already satisfy the non-negativity constraint, $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_4 \\ge 0$. We will let $y_1 = x_1$ and $y_5 = x_4$.\n\n- The variable $x_2$ is non-positive, $x_2 \\le 0$. We introduce a new variable $y_2 \\ge 0$ such that $x_2 = -y_2$. This substitution ensures non-negativity for the new variable.\n\n- The variables $x_3$ and $x_5$ are unrestricted in sign (free). Any free variable can be expressed as the difference of two non-negative variables.\nFor $x_3$, we introduce $y_3 \\ge 0$ and $y_4 \\ge 0$, such that $x_3 = y_3 - y_4$.\nFor $x_5$, we introduce $y_6 \\ge 0$ and $y_7 \\ge 0$, such that $x_5 = y_6 - y_7$.\n\nThe conversion of the original five variables ($x_1, \\dots, x_5$) necessitates a total of $1+1+2+1+2 = 7$ new non-negative variables.\n\n**Step 3: Standardize the Constraints to Equalities**\nThe standard form requires all constraints to be equalities. We introduce slack and surplus variables to convert the inequalities.\n\n- The first constraint is a 'less than or equal to' inequality:\n$$ 2x_1 - x_2 + 3x_3 - x_4 + x_5 \\le 7 $$\nTo convert this to an equality, we add a non-negative **slack variable**, which we will call $y_8$.\n$$ 2x_1 - x_2 + 3x_3 - x_4 + x_5 + y_8 = 7, \\quad \\text{with } y_8 \\ge 0 $$\n\n- The second constraint is a 'greater than or equal to' inequality:\n$$ -x_1 + 4x_2 + x_3 + 2x_4 - 3x_5 \\ge 5 $$\nTo convert this to an equality, we subtract a non-negative **surplus variable**, which we will call $y_9$.\n$$ -x_1 + 4x_2 + x_3 + 2x_4 - 3x_5 - y_9 = 5, \\quad \\text{with } y_9 \\ge 0 $$\n\n- The third constraint is already an equality, so no new variables are needed for its conversion.\n$$ 3x_1 - 2x_2 + x_4 - x_5 = -2 $$\n\nThe conversion of the inequality constraints introduces $1+1=2$ new non-negative variables.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Standard-Form Problem**\nWe now substitute the new variables defined in Step 2 into the objective function and the constraints.\n\nSubstitutions:\n$x_1 = y_1$\n$x_2 = -y_2$\n$x_3 = y_3 - y_4$\n$x_4 = y_5$\n$x_5 = y_6 - y_7$\n\nThe objective function becomes:\n$$ \\max\\; z = 5(y_1) - 3(-y_2) + (y_3 - y_4) + (y_5) - 2(y_6 - y_7) $$\n$$ \\max\\; z = 5y_1 + 3y_2 + y_3 - y_4 + y_5 - 2y_6 + 2y_7 + 0y_8 + 0y_9 $$\n\nThe constraints become:\n1. $2(y_1) - (-y_2) + 3(y_3 - y_4) - (y_5) + (y_6 - y_7) + y_8 = 7$\n   $2y_1 + y_2 + 3y_3 - 3y_4 - y_5 + y_6 - y_7 + y_8 = 7$\n\n2. $-(y_1) + 4(-y_2) + (y_3 - y_4) + 2(y_5) - 3(y_6 - y_7) - y_9 = 5$\n   $-y_1 - 4y_2 + y_3 - y_4 + 2y_5 - 3y_6 + 3y_7 - y_9 = 5$\n\n3. $3(y_1) - 2(-y_2) + (y_5) - (y_6 - y_7) = -2$\n   $3y_1 + 2y_2 + y_5 - y_6 + y_7 = -2$\n\nThe complete variable vector in standard form is $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5, y_6, y_7, y_8, y_9)^\\top$, with the condition $\\mathbf{y} \\ge \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Total Number of Variables**\nThe question asks for the total number of variables in the final vector $\\mathbf{y}$.

Their octane ratings are $o_{1} = 87$, $o_{2} = 90$, $o_{3} = 96$, and $o_{4} = 110$. The per-unit costs are $c_{1} = 1.04$, $c_{2} = 1.12$, $c_{3} = 1.31$, and $c_{4} = 1.18$.

The target standard form is defined as a maximization problem with equality constraints and non-negative variables.\n\n**1. Conversion to Standard Form**\n\nThe given problem has a minimization objective, variables with non-zero lower bounds, and inequality constraints. We address these sequentially to convert to a maximization standard form.\n\n**a. Change of Variables for Bounds**\nTo handle the lower bounds $x_i \\geq l_i$, we introduce new variables $x'_i \\geq 0$ defined by the substitution $x_i = x'_i + l_i$. The lower bounds are $l_1 = 0.2$, $l_2 = 0.1$, $l_3 = 0.1$, and $l_4 = 0.0$.\nThe substitution is:\n- $x_1 = x'_1 + 0.2$\n- $x_2 = x'_2 + 0.1$\n- $x_3 = x'_3 + 0.1$\n- $x_4 = x'_4 + 0.0 = x'_4$\nwhere $x'_1, x'_2, x'_3, x'_4 \\geq 0$.\n\nThe upper bounds on $x_i$ transform into upper bounds on $x'_i$:\n- $x_1 \\leq 0.6 \\implies x'_1 + 0.2 \\leq 0.6 \\implies x'_1 \\leq 0.4$\n- $x_2 \\leq 0.5 \\implies x'_2 + 0.1 \\leq 0.5 \\implies x'_2 \\leq 0.4$\n- $x_3 \\leq 0.4 \\implies x'_3 + 0.1 \\leq 0.4 \\implies x'_3 \\leq 0.3$\n- $x_4 \\leq 0.3 \\implies x'_4 \\leq 0.3$\n\n**b. Rewriting the Objective and Constraints**\nWe substitute these new variables into the objective function and constraints.\n\nThe objective is to minimize cost, but the standard form requires maximization. We use the equivalence $\\min(f) \\equiv -\\max(-f)$.\nOriginal objective: $\\min \\sum c_i x_i = \\min (1.04(x'_1 + 0.2) + 1.12(x'_2 + 0.1) + 1.31(x'_3 + 0.1) + 1.18 x'_4)$.\nThis simplifies to $\\min (1.04 x'_1 + 1.12 x'_2 + 1.31 x'_3 + 1.18 x'_4 + 0.451)$.\nThe constant $0.451$ does not affect the optimal variable values, so we can temporarily ignore it. To convert to maximization, we negate the variable part:\n$$ \\max -(1.04 x'_1 + 1.12 x'_2 + 1.31 x'_3 + 1.18 x'_4) $$\n$$ \\max -1.04 x'_1 - 1.12 x'_2 - 1.31 x'_3 - 1.18 x'_4 $$\n\nThe proportion sum constraint becomes:\n$$ (x'_1 + 0.2) + (x'_2 + 0.1) + (x'_3 + 0.1) + x'_4 = 1 \\implies x'_1 + x'_2 + x'_3 + x'_4 = 0.6 $$\n\nThe octane constraint becomes:\n$$ 91 \\leq 87(x'_1 + 0.2) + 90(x'_2 + 0.1) + 96(x'_3 + 0.1) + 110 x'_4 \\leq 93 $$\nThe constant offset within the expression is $87(0.2) + 90(0.1) + 96(0.1) = 36.0$.\n$$ 91 \\leq (87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4) + 36.0 \\leq 93 $$\nSubtracting $36.0$ from all parts gives:\n$$ 55 \\leq 87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 \\leq 57 $$\n\n**c. Introducing Slack and Surplus Variables**\nWe convert all remaining inequalities into equalities using non-negative slack and surplus variables.\n\nThe two-sided octane constraint is split into two inequalities:\n1. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 \\geq 55$\n2. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 \\leq 57$\nWe introduce a surplus variable $s_{o1} \\ge 0$ for the first and a slack variable $s_{o2} \\ge 0$ for the second:\n1. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 - s_{o1} = 55$\n2. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 + s_{o2} = 57$\n\nThe upper-bound inequalities for $x'_i$ are converted using slack variables $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \\ge 0$:\n- $x'_1 \\leq 0.4 \\implies x'_1 + s_1 = 0.4$\n- $x'_2 \\leq 0.4 \\implies x'_2 + s_2 = 0.4$\n- $x'_3 \\leq 0.3 \\implies x'_3 + s_3 = 0.3$\n- $x'_4 \\leq 0.3 \\implies x'_4 + s_4 = 0.3$\n\n**d. The Standard Form LP**\nThe vector of variables is $z = (x'_1, x'_2, x'_3, x'_4, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_{o1}, s_{o2})^{\\top}$. There are $10$ variables, all required to be non-negative ($z \\ge 0$).\n\nThe system of equality constraints $Az = b$ consists of $7$ equations:\n1. $x'_1 + x'_2 + x'_3 + x'_4 = 0.6$\n2. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 - s_{o1} = 55$\n3. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 + s_{o2} = 57$\n4. $x'_1 + s_1 = 0.4$\n5. $x'_2 + s_2 = 0.4$\n6. $x'_3 + s_3 = 0.3$\n7. $x'_4 + s_4 = 0.3$\n\nThe constraint matrix $A$ is a $7 \\times 10$ matrix.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Sum Constraint**\nThe equality constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_{i} = 1$ is structurally fundamental. It defines the variables $x_i$ as proportions of a single unit of the blend. This normalization is what allows the objective function to be interpreted as cost *per unit*. Without this constraint, the problem would be unbounded for any feasible solution with a negative cost, or the trivial solution $x=0$ would be optimal if costs were positive. By confining the feasible set to a specific affine hyperplane, this constraint ensures the region is compact (closed and bounded), guaranteeing that a minimum cost exists.\n\n**3. Nullity of the Constraint Matrix A**\nThe nullity of a matrix $A$ is given by the rank-nullity theorem: $\\text{nullity}(A) = n - \\text{rank}(A)$, where $n$ is the number of columns.\nOur matrix $A$ has $n=10$ columns. We need to find its rank by checking the linear independence of its 7 rows. Let the rows be $R_1, \\dots, R_7$. We seek coefficients $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_7$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{7} \\alpha_i R_i = 0$.\n\nLet's inspect the equation column by column, focusing on the columns with single non-zero entries.\n- Column 5 (for $s_1$): The only non-zero entry is in $R_4$. So, the equation for this column is $\\alpha_4 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_4 = 0$.\n- Column 6 (for $s_2$): The only non-zero entry is in $R_5$. So, $\\alpha_5 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_5 = 0$.\n- Column 7 (for $s_3$): The only non-zero entry is in $R_6$. So, $\\alpha_6 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_6 = 0$.\n- Column 8 (for $s_4$): The only non-zero entry is in $R_7$. So, $\\alpha_7 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\implies \\alpha_7 = 0$.\n\nNow the linear combination simplifies to $\\alpha_1 R_1 + \\alpha_2 R_2 + \\alpha_3 R_3 = 0$.\n- Column 9 (for $s_{o1}$): The entries in $R_1, R_2, R_3$ are $0, -1, 0$. The equation is $\\alpha_2(-1) = 0 \\implies \\alpha_2 = 0$.\n- Column 10 (for $s_{o2}$): The entries are $0, 0, 1$. The equation is $\\alpha_3(1) = 0 \\implies \\alpha_3 = 0$.\n\nThis leaves us with $\\alpha_1 R_1 = 0$. Since $R_1$ is not a zero vector, we must have $\\alpha_1 = 0$.\nSince all coefficients $\\alpha_i$ must be zero, the 7 rows of $A$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of $A$ is 7.\n\nFinally, we compute the nullity:\n$$ \\text{nullity}(A) = n - \\text{rank}(A) = 10 - 7 = 3 $$\nThe dimension of the solution space of $Az = b$ (without the non-negativity constraints) is 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3113264"}, {"introduction": "A true test of understanding is not just applying rules correctly, but also recognizing and diagnosing errors.

The constraints are $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$, with $x_1 \\ge 0, x_2 \\ge 0$. Since the second constraint fixes the value of $x_1 + 2x_2$ to be 6, the first constraint becomes $6 \\ge 4$, which is always true. Thus, the first constraint is redundant. The feasible region is the set of points on the line segment $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ in the first quadrant (e.g., $(6, 0)$ is a feasible point). The original LP is **feasible**.\n\nNext, let's analyze the feasibility of the student's converted system. The constraints are $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$, with $x_1, x_2, s_1 \\ge 0$. Substituting the second constraint into the first gives:\n$$6 + s_1 = 4$$\nThis implies $s_1 = -2$. This result contradicts the requirement that $s_1$ be non-negative ($s_1 \\ge 0$). Therefore, there is no solution that satisfies the student's system of constraints. The converted system is **infeasible**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The equality $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$ encodes $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$, not $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$, so together with $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ it renders the converted system infeasible even though the original system is feasible.**\nThis statement is entirely correct. The equation $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$ is algebraically equivalent to $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$. The student incorrectly used a slack variable for a 'greater-than-or-equal-to' constraint. Combining the student's new constraint $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$ with the original constraint $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ creates a contradiction. As analyzed above, this makes the converted system infeasible, while the original system was feasible.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A correct equality conversion of the first constraint is $x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$, or equivalently $-x_1 - 2x_2 + s_1 = -4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$.**\nThis statement describes the proper procedure. A 'greater-than-or-equal-to' inequality like $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$ means the left-hand side is larger than the right-hand side by some non-negative amount. This amount is called a surplus variable. To create an equality, this surplus variable must be subtracted: $x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 4$, where $s_1 \\ge 0$. Multiplying this correct equation by -1 yields $-x_1 - 2x_2 + s_1 = -4$, which is an equivalent representation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In the correct dual of the original maximization problem, the dual variable associated with the first constraint must satisfy $y_1 \\le 0$; treating that constraint as a “less-than-or-equal” and taking $y_1 \\ge 0$ is a dual sign error.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the rule for constructing the dual problem. For a primal maximization problem, a 'greater-than-or-equal-to' constraint corresponds to a non-positive dual variable ($y_i \\le 0$). The student's error is equivalent to treating the constraint as 'less-than-or-equal-to', which would incorrectly lead to a non-negative dual variable ($y_i \\ge 0$). This is a fundamental sign error in duality theory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because the right-hand sides are nonnegative, adding a nonnegative slack with a plus sign to any constraint never changes the feasible region.**\nThis statement is false. As demonstrated by this very problem, adding a slack variable with a plus sign to a 'greater-than-or-equal-to' constraint changes it to a 'less-than-or-equal-to' constraint, which fundamentally alters the feasible region. The original feasible region for the first constraint was the half-plane where $x_1+2x_2 \\ge 4$; the student's conversion changes this to the half-plane where $x_1+2x_2 \\le 4$.
