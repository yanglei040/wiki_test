Let $x_1, x_2, x_3$ represent the duration (in hours) for which each process is run. The total energy consumption, which the plant seeks to minimize, is a linear function of these durations. The objective function to minimize is $E = 4x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3$ in units of megawatt-hours (MWh).\n\nFor the chip to function correctly, two quality control specifications must be met. These relate to the minimum required concentration of two types of dopants, P-type and N-type, which are functions of the process durations.\n1.  P-type dopant concentration constraint: $2x_1 + x_2 + 3x_3 \\ge 10$ (in arbitrary concentration units)\n2.  N-type dopant concentration constraint: $x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 \\ge 12$ (in arbitrary concentration units)\n3.  The durations must be non-negative: $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\ge 0$.\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem using the dual simplex method, you must first set up the initial tableau. The standard form for this method requires converting the `≥` inequalities to `≤` inequalities before adding slack variables ($s_1, s_2$) to form equalities. The tableau should be arranged with the objective function row first, followed by the rows for the two constraints. The columns should represent the variables in the order $x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2$.\n\nDetermine the location of the first pivot element that would be chosen according to the rules of the dual simplex algorithm. Express your answer as a pair of integers `(row index, column index)`. These indices refer to the position within the matrix of coefficients corresponding to the constraints (i.e., excluding the objective row and the solution/RHS column). Use 1-based indexing, where row 1 is the first constraint row and column 1 corresponds to variable $x_1$.", "solution": "We are to minimize $E = 4x_{1} + 3x_{2} + 5x_{3}$ subject to\n$$2x_{1} + x_{2} + 3x_{3} \\ge 10, \\quad x_{1} + 2x_{2} + x_{3} \\ge 12, \\quad x_{1},x_{2},x_{3} \\ge 0.$$\nFor the dual simplex method, we first convert the $\\ge$ constraints to $\\le$ by multiplying by $-1$, then add slack variables $s_{1}, s_{2} \\ge 0$:\n$$-2x_{1} - x_{2} - 3x_{3} + s_{1} = -10,$$\n$$-x_{1} - 2x_{2} - x_{3} + s_{2} = -12.$$\nThe initial tableau is constructed with these constraints and an objective row for minimization. The standard convention for the objective row uses the reduced costs $\\bar{c}_j = c_j - z_j$. For the initial basis of slack variables, these are simply the cost coefficients, $\\bar{c}_1=4, \\bar{c}_2=3, \\bar{c}_3=5$. Since they are non-negative, the tableau is dual feasible. The RHS values of $-10$ and $-12$ show the solution is primal infeasible, as required.\n\n**Dual simplex pivot selection:**\n1.  **Leaving Variable**: Choose the row with the most negative RHS. Here, $\\min\\{-10,-12\\} = -12$, so pivot row is the second constraint (row index $2$), and $s_2$ is the leaving variable.\n2.  **Entering Variable**: Among columns with negative coefficients in the pivot row, compute the ratios $\\bar{c}_{j}/(-a_{rj})$ and choose the minimum. In row $2$, the coefficients for $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are $a_{2,1} = -1$, $a_{2,2} = -2$, and $a_{2,3} = -1$. Using the reduced costs from the objective row ($\\bar{c}_{1} = 4, \\bar{c}_{2} = 3, \\bar{c}_{3} = 5$):\n$$\\frac{\\bar{c}_{1}}{-a_{2,1}} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4, \\quad \\frac{\\bar{c}_{2}}{-a_{2,2}} = \\frac{3}{2}, \\quad \\frac{\\bar{c}_{3}}{-a_{2,3}} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5.$$\nThe minimum ratio is $\\frac{3}{2}$ at column $x_{2}$, which is column index $2$.\n\nTherefore, the first pivot element is at row $2$, column $2$ (the entry $-2$ in the $x_{2}$ column of the second constraint row).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2  2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2213009"}, {"introduction": "Once the initial tableau is set, the core of the dual simplex method is the pivot operation, which iteratively seeks primal feasibility while maintaining dual feasibility.
