The objective is to minimize total daily cost. Food $1$ (rice) costs $0.50 per serving and provides $200$ calories and $4$ grams of protein per serving. Food $2$ (beans) costs $0.60 per serving and provides $100$ calories and $10$ grams of protein per serving. The minimum daily requirements are $600$ calories and $24$ grams of protein. Formulate the LP as minimizing $c^{\\top} x$ subject to $A x \\ge b$, where $c = (0.50, 0.60)$, $x = (x_1, x_2)$, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 200  100 \\\\ 4  10 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $b = \\begin{pmatrix} 600 \\\\ 24 \\end{pmatrix}$.

The optimal solution will be at a vertex of the feasible region. By solving the system of equations for the binding constraints ($200 x_1 + 100 x_2 = 600$ and $4 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 24$), we find the intersection point:\n$$ x_1^* = 2.25, \\quad x_2^* = 1.5 $$\nAt this point, the objective value is $Z^* = 0.50(2.25) + 0.60(1.5) = 1.125 + 0.9 = 2.025$. This point is the optimal solution.\n\nSince both optimal decision variables $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$ are positive, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions imply that the corresponding dual constraints must be binding (active) at the dual optimum. This gives us a system of two linear equations for the optimal dual variables $y_1^*$ and $y_2^*$:\n\\begin{align*} 200 y_1^* + 4 y_2^*  = 0.50 \\\\ 100 y_1^* + 10 y_2^*  = 0.60 \\end{align*}\nSolving this system yields:\n$$ y_1^* = 0.001625, \\quad y_2^* = 0.04375 $$\nThe shadow price for the caloric constraint is $y_1^* = 0.001625$ dollars per calorie.

Optimal Solution and Binding Constraints**\n\nThis is a two-dimensional LP problem, which can be solved graphically by examining the vertices of the feasible region. The feasible region is a polygon in the first quadrant defined by the inequalities. The vertices are the intersection points of the boundary lines.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n- Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$: $(0, 0)$.\n- Intersection of $x_1=3$ and $x_2=0$: $(3, 0)$.\n- Intersection of $x_1=3$ and $2x_1+x_2=8$: $2(3)+x_2=8 \\implies x_2=2$. The vertex is $(3, 2)$. Note that this point satisfies $x_1+2x_2 = 3+2(2)=7 \\le 8$.\n- Intersection of $2x_1+x_2=8$ and $x_1+2x_2=8$: From $x_2=8-2x_1$, we substitute into the second equation: $x_1+2(8-2x_1)=8 \\implies x_1+16-4x_1=8 \\implies 3x_1=8 \\implies x_1=8/3$. Then $x_2=8-2(8/3) = 8-16/3 = 8/3$. The vertex is $(8/3, 8/3)$. Note that this point satisfies $x_1 = 8/3 \\le 3$.\n- Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_1+2x_2=8$: $2x_2=8 \\implies x_2=4$. The vertex is $(0, 4)$.\n\nWe evaluate the objective function $z = 3x_{1} + 2x_{2}$ at each vertex:\n- At $(0, 0)$: $z=3(0)+2(0)=0$.\n- At $(3, 0)$: $z=3(3)+2(0)=9$.\n- At $(3, 2)$: $z=3(3)+2(2)=13$.\n- At $(8/3, 8/3)$: $z=3(8/3)+2(8/3)=8+16/3=40/3 \\approx 13.33$.\n- At $(0, 4)$: $z=3(0)+2(4)=8$.\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is $z^{\\star}=40/3$, which occurs at the vertex $(8/3, 8/3)$. Thus, the optimal solution vector is $x^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8/3 \\\\ 8/3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo determine which constraints are binding at $x^{\\star}$, we substitute the optimal solution into the original inequalities:\n- Constraint (1): $2(8/3) + 8/3 = 16/3 + 8/3 = 24/3 = 8$. Since $8 \\leq 8$ holds with equality, this constraint is **binding**.\n- Constraint (2): $8/3 + 2(8/3) = 8/3 + 16/3 = 24/3 = 8$. Since $8 \\leq 8$ holds with equality, this constraint is **binding**.\n- Constraint (3): $8/3 \\leq 3$. Since $8/3 \\approx 2.67$, the inequality $2.67 \\le 3$ is strict. This constraint is **non-binding**.\n- Constraint (4): $8/3 \\geq 0$. This is strict, hence non-binding.\n- Constraint (5): $8/3 \\geq 0$. This is strict, hence non-binding.\n\nThe binding constraints at $x^{\\star}$ are $2x_{1} + x_{2} = 8$ and $x_{1} + 2x_{2} = 8$.\n\n**2. Effect of Changing the RHS of a Non-binding Constraint**\n\nThe problem is modified by changing constraint (3) to $x_{1} \\leq 3 - \\Delta$, where $\\Delta \\geq 0$. We must explain why the solution $x^{\\star}$ remains optimal for a range of $\\Delta$. We use the theory of duality.\n\nThe dual problem (D) corresponding to the original primal problem (P) is:\n$$ \\text{minimize } w = 8y_{1} + 8y_{2} + 3y_{3} $$\nsubject to\n\\begin{align*} 2y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} \\geq 3 \\\\ y_{1} + 2y_{2} \\geq 2 \\\\ y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3} \\geq 0 \\end{align*}\nwhere $y_1, y_2, y_3$ are the dual variables corresponding to the primal constraints (1), (2), and (3) respectively.\n\nThe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which include primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and complementary slackness, must hold at optimality.\nFrom Part 1, we know $x^{\\star}=(8/3, 8/3)$. Since $x_1^{\\star}  0$ and $x_2^{\\star}  0$, the corresponding dual constraints must be binding at the dual optimum $y^{\\star}$:\n\\begin{align*} 2y_1^{\\star} + y_2^{\\star} + y_3^{\\star} = 3 \\\\ y_1^{\\star} + 2y_2^{\\star} = 2 \\end{align*}\nAlso, since primal constraint (3), $x_1 \\leq 3$, is non-binding at $x^{\\star}$ (i.e., $x_1^{\\star}  3$), its corresponding dual variable must be zero by complementary slackness: $y_3^{\\star}=0$.\n\nSubstituting $y_3^{\\star}=0$ into the system gives:\n\\begin{align*} 2y_1^{\\star} + y_2^{\\star} = 3 \\\\ y_1^{\\star} + 2y_2^{\\star} = 2 \\end{align*}\nSolving this system yields $y_1^{\\star}=4/3$ and $y_2^{\\star}=1/3$. The optimal dual solution is $y^{\\star}=(4/3, 1/3, 0)$. This solution is dual feasible as $y_1^{\\star} \\geq 0, y_2^{\\star} \\geq 0, y_3^{\\star} \\geq 0$.\n\nNow, consider the new problem (P') with the constraint $x_{1} \\leq 3 - \\Delta$. The corresponding new dual problem (D') is:\n$$ \\text{minimize } w' = 8y_{1} + 8y_{2} + (3-\\Delta)y_{3} $$\nsubject to the same constraints as (D).\n\nFor the pair $(x^{\\star}, y^{\\star})$ to remain optimal for the new problem, it must satisfy the optimality conditions for (P') and (D'):\n- **Dual Feasibility**: The constraints of (D') are identical to those of (D). Since $y^{\\star}=(4/3, 1/3, 0)$ was feasible for (D), it remains feasible for (D').\n- **Primal Feasibility**: The original solution $x^{\\star}=(8/3, 8/3)$ must be feasible for (P'). The first two constraints and the non-negativity constraints are unaffected and satisfied. The only condition to check is the modified one: $x_{1}^{\\star} \\leq 3 - \\Delta$, which means $8/3 \\leq 3 - \\Delta$. As long as this holds, $x^{\\star}$ is primal feasible.\n- **Complementary Slackness**: We check the conditions for the pair $(x^{\\star}, y^{\\star})$ with respect to the new problem.\n  - $y_1^{\\star}(8 - (2x_1^{\\star} + x_2^{\\star})) = (4/3)(8 - 8) = 0$. (Holds)\n  - $y_2^{\\star}(8 - (x_1^{\\star} + 2x_2^{\\star})) = (1/3)(8 - 8) = 0$. (Holds)\n  - $y_3^{\\star}((3-\\Delta) - x_1^{\\star}) = 0 \\cdot ((3-\\Delta) - 8/3) = 0$. This holds for any $\\Delta$.\n  - $x_1^{\\star}( (2y_1^{\\star} + y_2^{\\star} + y_3^{\\star}) - 3 ) = (8/3)( (2(4/3) + 1/3 + 0) - 3) = (8/3)(3-3)=0$. (Holds)\n  - $x_2^{\\star}( (y_1^{\\star} + 2y_2^{\\star}) - 2 ) = (8/3)( (4/3 + 2(1/3)) - 2) = (8/3)(2-2)=0$. (Holds)\n\nAll optimality conditions are satisfied provided that $x^{\\star}$ remains primal feasible. The crucial observation is that because the original constraint was non-binding, its dual variable $y_3^{\\star}$ is zero. This zero value \"absorbs\" the change in the RHS of that constraint, leaving the dual objective value at $y^{\\star}$ unchanged: $w'(y^{\\star}) = 8(4/3) + 8(1/3) + (3-\\Delta)(0) = 40/3$. The primal objective value at $x^{\\star}$ is also unchanged at $z(x^{\\star})=40/3$. Since the primal objective equals the dual objective, and both solutions are feasible within a certain range of $\\Delta$, they must remain optimal.\n\n**3. Computation of $\\Delta_{\\max}$**\n\nAs established in Part 2, the solution $x^{\\star}=(8/3, 8/3)$ and value $z^{\\star}=40/3$ remain optimal as long as $x^{\\star}$ remains a feasible solution to the perturbed problem. The only constraint that can be violated is the modified one. The condition for feasibility is:\n$$ x_{1}^{\\star} \\leq 3 - \\Delta $$\nSubstituting the value $x_{1}^{\\star}=8/3$:\n$$ \\frac{8}{3} \\leq 3 - \\Delta $$\nWe are looking for the largest non-negative $\\Delta$ that satisfies this inequality. We can rearrange the inequality to solve for $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta \\leq 3 - \\frac{8}{3} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\leq \\frac{9}{3} - \\frac{8}{3} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\leq \\frac{1}{3} $$\nCombined with the given condition $\\Delta \\geq 0$, the old solution remains optimal for all $\\Delta$ in the range $0 \\leq \\Delta \\leq 1/3$. The largest non-negative value for $\\Delta$ for which this holds is $\\Delta_{\\max} = 1/3$. If $\\Delta  1/3$, the point $x^{\\star}$ becomes infeasible, and the location of the optimal solution must change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "3179215"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into a more nuanced and counterintuitive scenario known as degeneracy, where an optimal solution is \"over-determined.\" In this exercise, you will analyze a problem where a constraint is active—meaning it is met with equality at the optimal point—yet its shadow price is still zero.

Optimal Solution and Basis**\n\nBy inspecting the feasible region graphically, the vertices are at $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$. Evaluating the objective function $z = x_{1} + x_{2}$ at these vertices:\n$z(0,0) = 0+0 = 0$\n$z(2,0) = 2+0 = 2$\n$z(0,2) = 0+2 = 2$\n$z(2,2) = 2+2 = 4$\nThe maximum value of $z$ is $4$, which occurs at $(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (2,2)$.\n\nAt this optimal point, the values of the slack variables are:\n$s_{1} = 4 - x_{1} - x_{2} = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0$\n$s_{2} = 2 - x_{1} = 2 - 2 = 0$\n$s_{3} = 2 - x_{2} = 2 - 2 = 0$\nThe optimal solution is $(x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}) = (2, 2, 0, 0, 0)$.\nSince there are $m=3$ constraints, a basic feasible solution (BFS) must have $3$ basic variables. Here, only two variables are non-zero. This indicates that the optimal solution is degenerate. Multiple choices of basis can correspond to this single optimal corner point.\n\nWe select a basis consisting of variables $\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}\\}$. The non-basic variables are $\\{s_{2}, s_{3}\\}$, which are set to $0$. This choice corresponds to the solution point being defined by constraints $2$ and $3$ ($s_2=0 \\implies x_1=2$; $s_3=0 \\implies x_2=2$). The values of the basic variables are: $x_1=2$, $x_2=2$, and $s_1=4-x_1-x_2=0$. Thus, the chosen basis is $B_{vars} = \\{x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}\\}$ and the optimal BFS is $(x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}) = (2, 2, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**2.

The new RHS vector is $b' = \\begin{pmatrix} 4+\\Delta \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe basis matrix $B$ is formed by the columns of $A$ corresponding to the basic variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}$:\n$B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe inverse of the basis matrix, $B^{-1}$, is:\n$B^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ 1  -1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe values of the basic variables for the perturbed RHS $b'$ are given by $x_{B} = B^{-1}b'$.

This means the allowable increase for $b_{1}$ is any non-negative value ($\\Delta \\ge 0$), making the allowable increase range non-zero. The allowable decrease is zero, as any $\\Delta  0$ would make $s_{1}$ negative, violating feasibility. This fulfills the conditions specified in the task.\n\n**3. Shadow Price for Constraint 1**\n\nThe vector of dual variables (shadow prices), $y^T$, is given by the formula $y^T = c_{B}^T B^{-1}$, where $c_{B}$ is the vector of objective function coefficients for the basic variables.\nFor the basis $\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}\\}$, the coefficient vector is $c_{B}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (coefficients of $x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}$ in $z$).\nUsing the $B^{-1}$ computed earlier:\n$y^T = \\begin{pmatrix} y_{1}  y_{2}  y_{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ 1  -1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$y^T = \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(0)+(1)(0)+(0)(1)  (1)(1)+(1)(0)+(0)(-1)  (1)(0)+(1)(1)+(0)(-1) \\end{pmatrix}$\n$y^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe shadow prices for constraints $1$, $2$, and $3$ are $y_{1}=0$, $y_{2}=1$, and $y_{3}=1$, respectively.\nThe shadow price associated with constraint $1$ for the chosen optimal basis is $y_{1} = 0$.\n\n**4. Geometric Interpretation**\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon defined by the inequalities $x_{1} \\ge 0$, $x_{2} \\ge 0$, $x_{1} \\le 2$, $x_{2} \\le 2$, and $x_{1}+x_{2} \\le 4$. The optimal solution is at the vertex $(2,2)$. This vertex is the intersection point of the lines $x_{1}=2$ (constraint $2$) and $x_{2}=2$ (constraint $3$). Notably, the line $x_{1}+x_{2}=4$ (constraint $1$) also passes through this point. This means all three constraints are active at the optimum, making it an over-determined (degenerate) corner.\n\nThe shadow price of a constraint measures the rate of change in the optimal objective value per unit increase in the constraint's right-hand-side.\nConstraint $1$ is $x_{1}+x_{2} \\le 4$.\nA zero allowable decrease for this basis means that if we tighten this constraint (e.g., $x_{1}+x_{2} \\le 3.9$), the current optimal point $(2,2)$ becomes infeasible. The feasible region shrinks, and the optimum must change. A small change in $b_1$ leads to a change in the basis.\n\nA non-zero allowable increase means we can relax this constraint (e.g., $x_{1}+x_{2} \\le 5$) without the current basis becoming suboptimal. Geometrically, relaxing constraint $1$ expands the feasible region. However, the optimal vertex at $(2,2)$ is determined by constraints $x_1 \\le 2$ and $x_2 \\le 2$. So, even if the region defined by constraint $1$ grows, the optimal corner remains fixed at $(2,2)$, and the optimal objective value remains $z=4$. Since increasing $b_1$ does not change the optimal value, the marginal value of increasing $b_1$ is $0$. This is why the shadow price is $0$. The constraint $x_{1}+x_{2} \\le 4$ is redundant in defining the optimal corner $(2,2)$, even though it passes through it. The true binding constraints that define this particular BFS are $x_1 \\le 2$ and $x_2 \\le 2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3179271"}]}
