The non-basic variables are $\\{s_1, s_2\\}$ with values $\\{0, 0\\}$. This is a valid basic feasible solution.\n\nThe problem statement is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the theory of linear programming, and internally consistent.\n\n**1.3. Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\n**2.1. Infeasibility of the Current Solution with the New Constraint**\nThe current optimal solution is $(x_1, x_2) = (2, 2)$. The new constraint is $\\tilde{c}: x_1 + x_2 \\leq 3.9$.\nSubstituting the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ into the new constraint:\n$$2 + 2 = 4$$\nThe value $4$ is not less than or equal to $3.9$. Thus, the current optimal solution $(x_1, x_2) = (2, 2)$ violates the new constraint and is no longer feasible for the modified problem.\n\n**2.2. Finding the New Optimum via the Dual Simplex Method**\nWe begin by constructing the final simplex tableau for the original problem. The system of equations is:\n$z - 3x_1 - 2x_2 = 0$\n$x_1 + x_2 + s_1 = 4$\n$x_1 + s_2 = 2$\n$x_2 + s_3 = 3$\n\nThe optimal basis is $B=\\{x_1, x_2, s_3\\}$ and the non-basic variables are $N=\\{s_1, s_2\\}$. We need to express the basic variables and the objective function in terms of the non-basic variables. From the second and first constraints (with $s_1=s_2=0$):\n$x_1 = 2 - s_2$\n$x_2 = 4 - x_1 - s_1 = 4 - (2 - s_2) - s_1 = 2 - s_1 + s_2$\nAnd from the third constraint:\n$s_3 = 3 - x_2 = 3 - (2 - s_1 + s_2) = 1 + s_1 - s_2$\n\nSubstitute $x_1$ and $x_2$ into the objective function:\n$z = 3(2-s_2) + 2(2-s_1+s_2) = 6 - 3s_2 + 4 - 2s_1 + 2s_2 = 10 - 2s_1 - s_2$\nThis can be rewritten as $z + 2s_1 + s_2 = 10$.\n\nThe final simplex tableau for the original problem represents this dictionary:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  z  x_1  x_2  s_1  s_2  s_3  \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\nz  1  0  0  2  1  0  10 \\\\\n\\hline\nx_1  0  1  0  0  1  0  2 \\\\\nx_2  0  0  1  1  -1  0  2 \\\\\ns_3  0  0  0  -1  1  1  1\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe z-row coefficients for non-basic variables are non-negative ($2$ and $1$), so this is indeed an optimal tableau for a maximization problem.\n\nNow, we add the new constraint $x_1 + x_2 + s_4 = 3.9$. We must express this constraint in terms of the non-basic variables $s_1, s_2$:\n$$(2 - s_2) + (2 - s_1 + s_2) + s_4 = 3.9$$\n$$4 - s_1 + s_4 = 3.9$$\n$$s_4 = -0.1 + s_1$$\nThis gives the new constraint row: $-s_1 + s_4 = -0.1$. We add this to the tableau, with $s_4$ as the new basic variable for this row.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  z  x_1  x_2  s_1  s_2  s_3  s_4  \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\nz  1  0  0  2  1  0  0  10 \\\\\n\\hline\nx_1  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  2 \\\\\nx_2  0  0  1  1  -1  0  0  2 \\\\\ns_3  0  0  0  -1  1  1  0  1 \\\\\ns_4  0  0  0  -1  0  0  1  -0.1\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe z-row is still optimal (all coefficients $\\ge 0$). However, the solution is not primal feasible because $s_4 = -0.1$, which violates the non-negativity constraint. This is the correct setup for the dual simplex method.\n\n**Dual Simplex Pivot:**\n1.  **Select Pivot Row:** Choose the row with the most negative value in the RHS column. This is the $s_4$ row. The variable $s_4$ will leave the basis.\n2.  **Select Pivot Column:** Find the minimum ratio $|\\frac{z_j-c_j}{a_{ij}}|$ for all $j$ where the pivot row entry $a_{ij}$ is negative. The pivot row ($i=s_4$) has only one negative entry: $a_{s_4, s_1} = -1$.\n    The ratio is $|\\frac{2}{-1}|=2$. Thus, the variable $s_1$ will enter the basis. The pivot element is $-1$.\n3.  **Perform Pivot:**\n    - Divide the pivot row (the $s_4$ row) by the pivot element ($-1$) to make the pivot entry $1$. The new row becomes the $s_1$ row in the next tableau:\n    Row $s_1' = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -1 | 0.1)$.\n    - Use this new row to make all other entries in the pivot column ($s_1$ column) zero.\n        - New z-row: Row $z' = \\text{Row } z - 2 \\cdot \\text{Row } s_1' = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2 | 9.8)$.\n        - New $x_1$-row: The entry is already $0$, so no change. Row $x_1'=$ Row $x_1$.\n        - New $x_2$-row: Row $x_2' = \\text{Row } x_2 - 1 \\cdot \\text{Row } s_1' = (0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1 | 1.9)$.\n        - New $s_3$-row: Row $s_3' = \\text{Row } s_3 - (-1) \\cdot \\text{Row } s_1' = \\text{Row } s_3 + \\text{Row } s_1' = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1 | 1.1)$.\n\nThe new tableau is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  z  x_1  x_2  s_1  s_2  s_3  s_4  \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\nz  1  0  0  0  1  0  2  9.8 \\\\\n\\hline\nx_1  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  2 \\\\\nx_2  0  0  1  0  -1  0  1  1.9 \\\\\ns_3  0  0  0  0  1  1  -1  1.1 \\\\\ns_1  0  0  0  1  0  0  -1  0.1\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe RHS column is now all non-negative, so the solution is primal feasible. The z-row coefficients are all non-negative, so it remains dual feasible (optimal).\nThe new optimal solution is: a BFS with basic variables $\\{x_1, x_2, s_3, s_1\\}$ and non-basic variables $\\{s_2, s_4\\}$.\n- $x_1 = 2$\n- $x_2 = 1.9$\n- $s_3 = 1.1$\n- $s_1 = 0.1$\n- $s_2=0$, $s_4=0$\nThe new optimal objective value is $z^{**} = 9.8$.\n\n**2.3. Verification using Sensitivity Analysis and Primal-Dual Theory**\nThe original primal LP (P) and its dual (D) are:\n(P) Maximize $z = 3x_1 + 2x_2$ s.t.\n$x_1 + x_2 \\leq 4$\n$x_1 \\leq 2$\n$x_2 \\leq 3$\n$x_1, x_2 \\geq 0$\n\n(D) Minimize $w = 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 3y_3$ s.t.\n$y_1 + y_2 \\geq 3$\n$y_1 + y_3 \\geq 2$\n$y_1, y_2, y_3 \\geq 0$\n\nThe original optimal primal solution is $(x_1, x_2) = (2, 2)$ with $z^\\star=10$.\nBy complementary slackness:\n- $x_1=2  0 \\implies y_1 + y_2 = 3$.\n- $x_2=2  0 \\implies y_1 + y_3 = 2$.\n- The constraint $x_2 \\leq 3$ is not binding ($2  3$, so slack $s_3=1  0$) $\\implies y_3 = 0$.\n- The constraints $x_1+x_2 \\leq 4$ and $x_1 \\leq 2$ are binding (slacks $s_1=0, s_2=0$), so their dual variables $y_1, y_2$ can be non-zero.\n\nSolving for the dual variables:\n$y_3=0 \\implies y_1+0=2 \\implies y_1=2$.\nThen $2+y_2=3 \\implies y_2=1$.\nThe optimal dual solution is $(y_1, y_2, y_3) = (2, 1, 0)$. This solution is dual feasible.\nThe dual variable $y_1=2$ is the shadow price for the first constraint, $x_1 + x_2 \\leq 4$. It represents the rate of change of the optimal objective value with respect to a change in the right-hand side (RHS) of this constraint, $\\frac{\\partial z^\\star}{\\partial b_1} = y_1=2$.\n\nThe introduction of the new constraint $x_1 + x_2 \\leq 3.9$ makes the original constraint $x_1 + x_2 \\leq 4$ redundant. This is equivalent to changing the RHS of the first constraint from $b_1=4$ to $b_1'=3.9$. The change is $\\Delta b_1 = 3.9 - 4 = -0.1$.\nThis change is small, so we can predict the change in the objective value as:\n$$\\Delta z^\\star \\approx y_1 \\Delta b_1 = 2 \\times (-0.1) = -0.2$$\nThe predicted new optimal value is $z^\\star_{new} = z^\\star + \\Delta z^\\star = 10 - 0.2 = 9.8$.\n\nThis prediction is exact as long as the change $\\Delta b_1$ is within the range where the optimal basis $\\{x_1, x_2, s_3\\}$ does not change. This range is determined by keeping the basic solution $x_B' = A_B^{-1}b'$ non-negative, where $b' = [4+\\Delta b_1, 2, 3]^T$. We found the dictionary expressions to be $x_1=2$, $x_2=2+\\Delta b_1$, $s_3=1-\\Delta b_1$. Feasibility requires $2 \\ge 0$, $2+\\Delta b_1 \\ge 0 \\implies \\Delta b_1 \\ge -2$, and $1-\\Delta b_1 \\ge 0 \\implies \\Delta b_1 \\le 1$. The change $\\Delta b_1 = -0.1$ is within the interval $[-2, 1]$, so the basis does not change and the shadow price calculation is exact.\n\nThe new optimal value of $9.8$ calculated by the dual simplex method is confirmed by the sensitivity analysis.\n\nThe final question asks for the new optimal objective value after adding the constraint $\\tilde{c}$, rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $9.8$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $9.800$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.800}$$", "id": "3095270"}, {"introduction": "Sensitivity analysis is not just about changes to existing parameters; it's also about evaluating entirely new opportunities.

The current optimal basis (and its corresponding optimal dual solution $y^\\star$) remains optimal for the expanded problem if and only if the reduced cost of the new variable $x_{n+1}$ is also non-negative, i.e., $r_{n+1}(y^\\star) \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's compute the reduced cost of $x_{n+1}$ with respect to $y^\\star$:\n$$ r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = c_{n+1} - (y^\\star)^\\top a_{n+1} $$\nSubstitute $a_{n+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i a_i$:\n$$ r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = c_{n+1} - (y^\\star)^\\top \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i a_i \\right) $$\nBy linearity of the dot product:\n$$ r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = c_{n+1} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i (y^\\star)^\\top a_i $$\nFrom the definition of the reduced cost for $x_i$, we have $(y^\\star)^\\top a_i = c_i - r_i(y^\\star)$. Substituting this into the expression for $r_{n+1}(y^\\star)$:\n$$ r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = c_{n+1} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i (c_i - r_i(y^\\star)) $$\n$$ r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = \\left( c_{n+1} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star) $$\nThis central equation allows us to evaluate the given options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. If $c_{n+1} \\ge \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i$, then the current optimal basis of the original problem remains optimal after adding $x_{n+1}$. Moreover, if $c_{n+1}  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i$, then $x_{n+1}$ cannot be basic in any optimal basis of the expanded problem.**\n\n*   **Part 1:** Assume $c_{n+1} \\ge \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i$. This means the term $\\left( c_{n+1} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i \\right) \\ge 0$. Since $y^\\star$ is an optimal dual solution, all reduced costs $r_i(y^\\star) \\ge 0$. We are also given $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$. Therefore, the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star) \\ge 0$.\n    The reduced cost of the new variable is $r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = (\\text{non-negative}) + (\\text{non-negative})$, which implies $r_{n+1}(y^\\star) \\ge 0$. Since the reduced costs for all original variables were already non-negative, and the new one is as well, the optimality conditions are met. The current optimal solution remains optimal. The first part of the statement is correct.\n\n*   **Part 2:** Assume $c_{n+1}  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i$. The term $\\left( c_{n+1} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i \\right)$ is strictly positive. As before, $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star) \\ge 0$. Thus, $r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = (\\text{strictly positive}) + (\\text{non-negative})  0$.\n    The set of optimal dual solutions for the expanded problem is a subset of the optimal dual solutions for the original problem. For any optimal dual solution $y^{opt}$ of the expanded problem, it must satisfy $A^\\top y^{opt} \\le c$ and $y^{opt} \\le 0$, hence $r_i(y^{opt}) \\ge 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n    Thus, for any optimal dual solution $y^{opt}$ of the expanded problem, its reduced cost for $x_{n+1}$ is $r_{n+1}(y^{opt}) = (c_{n+1} - \\sum \\lambda_i c_i) + \\sum \\lambda_i r_i(y^{opt})  0$.\n    For a variable to be included in an optimal basis, its reduced cost with respect to the dual solution associated with that basis must be zero. Since the reduced cost of $x_{n+1}$ is strictly positive for *all* optimal dual solutions, it can never be zero. Therefore, $x_{n+1}$ cannot be a basic variable in any optimal basis of the expanded problem. The second part of the statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Statement A is **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $c_{n+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i$, then for any optimal dual solution $y^\\star$ of the original problem, the reduced cost of $x_{n+1}$ equals $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star)$; in particular, $x_{n+1}$ has zero reduced cost at $y^\\star$ if and only if every $r_i(y^\\star)$ with $\\lambda_i  0$ equals $0$.**\n\n*   **Part 1:** Assume $c_{n+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i$. The term $\\left( c_{n+1} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i \\right) = 0$. Substituting this into our central equation gives:\n    $$ r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = 0 + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star) $$\n    This holds for any dual solution $y^\\star$, optimal or not. So the first part is correct.\n\n*   **Part 2:** We have $r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star)$.\n    We know $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$ and $r_i(y^\\star) \\ge 0$ for an optimal $y^\\star$. The sum is a sum of non-negative terms. Such a sum is zero if and only if every term in the sum is zero. That is, $\\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star) = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n    This condition is met if, for each $i$, either $\\lambda_i = 0$ or $r_i(y^\\star) = 0$. This is equivalent to stating that for every index $i$ where $\\lambda_i  0$, the corresponding reduced cost $r_i(y^\\star)$ must be $0$. The second part of the statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Statement B is **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $c_{n+1}  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i$, then for the optimal dual solution $y^\\star$ of the original problem, the reduced cost of $x_{n+1}$ is necessarily negative; hence the original optimum cannot remain optimal.**\n\n*   Assume $c_{n+1}  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i$. The term $\\left( c_{n+1} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i c_i \\right)$ is strictly negative.\n    The reduced cost is $r_{n+1}(y^\\star) = (\\text{strictly negative}) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star)$.\n    The second term $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i r_i(y^\\star)$ is non-negative. The sum of a negative number and a non-negative number is not necessarily negative.\n    For a counterexample, consider the LP $\\min\\; 10x_1$ subject to $x_1 \\le 1, x_1 \\ge 0$. The optimal solution is $x_1=0$ with optimal value $0$. The optimal dual solution for the equality form is $y^\\star=0$. The reduced cost of $x_1$ is $r_1(y^\\star) = 10 - 0 \\cdot 1 = 10$.\n    Now add a new variable $x_2$ with $a_2 = a_1$ (so $\\lambda_1=1$) and cost $c_2 = 5$.\n    This satisfies the condition $c_2  \\sum\\lambda_i c_i$, as $5  10$.\n    The reduced cost of $x_2$ is $r_2(y^\\star) = (c_2 - c_1) + \\lambda_1 r_1(y^\\star) = (5 - 10) + 1 \\cdot 10 = -5 + 10 = 5$.\n    Since $r_2(y^\\star)=5  0$, it is not negative. In this case, the original optimum remains optimal. The statement \"necessarily negative\" is false.\n\n**Verdict:** Statement C is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because $a_{n+1}$ is a convex combination of existing columns, $x_{n+1}$ can never be basic in any feasible basis of the equality-form linear program.**\n\n*   This statement confuses the linear dependence of a set of vectors with the inability of one of those vectors to be part of a basis.\n    A basis for the equality-form LP is a set of $m$ linearly independent columns from the full constraint matrix $[A, a_{n+1}, I]$.\n    The relation $a_{n+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i a_i$ implies that the set of columns $\\{a_{n+1}\\} \\cup \\{ a_i \\mid \\lambda_i  0 \\}$ is linearly dependent. This means these specific columns cannot all be in a basis *simultaneously*. It does not prevent $a_{n+1}$ from being part of a basis with other linearly independent columns.\n    For a counterexample, let $m=2, n=2$, and $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let $\\lambda_1=0.5, \\lambda_2=0.5$. Then $a_1=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, $a_2=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}$, and $a_{n+1}=a_3=0.5a_1+0.5a_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0.5\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Consider the set of columns $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$. The matrix formed by these columns is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0.5 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its determinant is $1 \\ne 0$. Thus, $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$ is a set of two linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and can form a basis. So $x_3$ (our $x_{n+1}$) can be a basic variable. We can even choose a vector $b$ to make this basis feasible. For example, if $b=\\begin{pmatrix}1.5 \\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix}$, the basic solution is $x_B = \\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\\\x_3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0.5 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\\begin{pmatrix}1.5 \\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -0.5 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1.5 \\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0.5 \\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix} \\ge 0$.\n    The premise of the statement is false.\n\n**Verdict:** Statement D is **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatements A and B are true, while statements C and D are false.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3095297"}]}
