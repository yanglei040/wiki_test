We denote the lower bound as $L=2$ and the upper bound as $U=11$.\n- Proposed big-$M$ inequality form: $y \\leq b + M(1 - x)$\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded within the established mathematical field of optimization and integer programming. The concepts of big-$M$ formulations, linear programming relaxations, and cutting planes (specifically mixed-integer rounding) are standard and well-defined. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary data ($b=7$, bounds on $y$) to derive a unique solution. The data is consistent and does not contain any contradictions. The problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions, such as being unsound, trivial, or ambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Big-$M$ Formulation and Validity Condition**\n\nThe logical implication to be encoded is $x=1 \\Rightarrow y \\leq b$. We are given the big-$M$ inequality form $y \\leq b + M(1 - x)$, where $M$ is a sufficiently large positive constant. We analyze this inequality for the two possible integer values of $x$.\n\nCase 1: $x=1$.\nThe inequality becomes $y \\leq b + M(1-1)$, which simplifies to $y \\leq b$. This correctly enforces the consequent of the implication, as required.\n\nCase 2: $x=0$.\nThe premise of the implication ($x=1$) is false, so the implication is vacuously true. In this case, the big-$M$ constraint should not impose any new restrictions on $y$ beyond its pre-existing bounds, which are given as $2 \\leq y \\leq 11$. The upper bound is $y \\leq 11$.\nWhen $x=0$, the inequality becomes $y \\leq b + M(1-0)$, which simplifies to $y \\leq b+M$.\nFor this constraint to be non-restrictive with respect to the known upper bound on $y$ (let's call it $U=11$), the new upper limit $b+M$ must be greater than or equal to $U$.\nTherefore, the validity condition is $b+M \\geq U$.\nThis can be rewritten to provide a condition on $M$:\n$M \\geq U - b$.\nAny value of $M$ satisfying this condition ensures that if $x=0$, the constraint $y \\leq b+M$ is redundant, as $y$ is already known to be bounded by $y \\leq U$. If $M  U-b$, then $b+M  U$, and the constraint $y \\leq b+M$ would incorrectly cut off feasible solutions where $x=0$ and $b+M  y \\leq U$.\n\n**Part 2: Smallest Valid Value of $M$**\n\nFrom Part 1, the condition for $M$ to yield a valid formulation is $M \\geq U - b$. To create the tightest possible linear programming relaxation, we should choose the smallest possible valid value for $M$.\nThe smallest value of $M$ that satisfies this inequality is $M = U - b$.\nUsing the given data:\n- The upper bound on $y$ is $U=11$.\n- The constant from the implication is $b=7$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we find the smallest valid $M$:\n$$M_{\\text{min}} = U - b = 11 - 7 = 4$$\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Mixed-Integer Rounding (MIR) Cut**\n\nThe problem asks us to derive a single valid linear inequality that represents the convex hull of the feasible region, using the principle of mixed-integer rounding. This is equivalent to deriving the tightest possible linear inequality for the problem. This can be achieved by substituting the smallest valid $M$ (derived in Part 2) into the general big-$M$ inequality. This procedure is a specific instance of generating a disjunctive cut, which is a form of MIR cut.\n\nLet's start with the big-$M$ inequality:\n$$y \\leq b + M(1 - x)$$\nSubstitute the tightest value $M = U - b$:\n$$y \\leq b + (U-b)(1 - x)$$\nNow, we expand and simplify the right-hand side of the inequality:\n$$y \\leq b + (U-b) - (U-b)x$$\n$$y \\leq U - (U-b)x$$\nThis is the strongest possible linear inequality for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ that is valid for the original integer problem. Let's substitute the given numerical values, $U=11$ and $b=7$:\n$$y \\leq 11 - (11-7)x$$\n$$y \\leq 11 - 4x$$\nThis inequality is of the form $y \\leq \\alpha + \\beta x$ with $\\alpha=11$ and $\\beta=-4$.\n\nWe verify this inequality against the problem's criteria:\n1.  **Satisfied by all integer-feasible points:**\n    - If $x=0$: The inequality becomes $y \\leq 11$. The feasible region for $x=0$ is $2 \\leq y \\leq 11$, so this is satisfied.\n    - If $x=1$: The inequality becomes $y \\leq 11 - 4(1) = 7$. The feasible region for $x=1$ is $y \\leq 7$ (and $y \\geq 2$), so this is satisfied.\n    The inequality is valid for all integer points.\n\n2.  **Cuts off the fractional point $(x,y)=(0.4, 11)$:**\n    Substitute the point into our derived inequality:\n    $$11 \\leq 11 - 4(0.4)$$\n    $$11 \\leq 11 - 1.6$$\n    $$11 \\leq 9.4$$\n    This statement is false. Thus, the inequality correctly cuts off the fractional point $(0.4, 11)$, which would have been feasible under a naïve (weaker) LP relaxation (e.g., using a very large $M$).\n\n3.  **Coincides with the convex hull:**\n    The feasible set of the mixed-integer problem is the union of two line segments: $\\{(0,y) | 2 \\leq y \\leq 11\\}$ and $\\{(1,y) | 2 \\leq y \\leq 7\\}$. The convex hull of this set is a quadrilateral with vertices at $(0,2)$, $(0,11)$, $(1,7)$, and $(1,2)$. The upper boundary of this convex region is the line segment connecting the points $(0,11)$ and $(1,7)$. The equation of the line passing through these two points is $y = (7-11)x + 11$, which simplifies to $y = -4x + 11$. Our derived inequality $y \\leq 11 - 4x$ precisely defines this upper boundary.\n\nThe explicit expression $\\alpha + \\beta x$ is therefore $11 - 4x$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11 - 4x}$$", "id": "3115608"}, {"introduction": "After learning to generate cuts, a crucial question arises: which cut is the \"best\" to add?
