Complete MIP Model**\n\nThe goal is to formulate a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the selected sensors.\nThe cost function is:\n$$ \\text{Minimize } \\sum_{j \\in \\{a,b,c\\}} c_j x_j $$\nGiven that $c_a = c_b = c_c = 1$, the objective function simplifies to:\n$$ \\text{Minimize } Z = x_a + x_b + x_c $$\n\n**Constraints:**\nThe core requirement is that every critical site must be covered by at least one sensor. This translates to a set of constraints, one for each site. A site $i$ is covered if the sum of the decision variables for sensors that cover site $i$ is at least $1$.\n\n-   **Constraint for Site 1:** Site $1$ is covered by sensors $a$ and $c$.

LP Relaxation and a Strengthening Valid Inequality**\n\n**Linear Programming (LP) Relaxation:**\nThe LP relaxation is obtained by relaxing the integrality constraint on the decision variables, i.e., replacing $x_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ with $0 \\le x_j \\le 1$.\n\nThe LP relaxation is:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Minimize } \\quad & Z_{LP} = x_a + x_b + x_c \\\\ \\text{Subject to } \\quad & x_a + x_c \\ge 1 \\\\ & x_a + x_b \\ge 1 \\\\ & x_b + x_c \\ge 1 \\\\ & 0 \\le x_a, x_b, x_c \\le 1 \\end{aligned} $$\nBy inspection, a feasible and optimal solution to this LP is $x_a = x_b = x_c = 0.5$, which yields an objective value of $Z_{LP} = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5$. This solution is fractional and therefore not a valid solution to the original MIP.\n\n**Strengthening Valid Inequality:**\nA valid inequality is an inequality that is satisfied by all integer feasible solutions. A strengthening valid inequality is one that cuts off some fractional solutions of the LP relaxation. We can derive such an inequality using a capacity-based argument on a subset of the sites.\n\nThe general form of such an inequality is derived by considering a subset of sites $I \\subseteq S$. For each site $i \\in I$, the constraint $\\sum_{j: i \\in S_j} x_j \\ge 1$ must hold. Summing these inequalities over all $i \\in I$ yields:\n$$ \\sum_{i \\in I} \\left( \\sum_{j: i \\in S_j} x_j \\right) \\ge \\sum_{i \\in I} 1 = |I| $$\nBy changing the order of summation, we get:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\in U} \\left( \\sum_{i \\in I \\cap S_j} 1 \\right) x_j \\ge |I| $$\nThis provides the general form of the inequality:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\in U} |S_j \\cap I| x_j \\ge |I| $$\n\nFor the given instance, let's choose the subset of sites to be all sites, i.e., $I = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. We have $|I|=3$. We calculate the size of the intersection of each sensor's coverage set with $I$:\n-   $|S_a \\cap I| = |\\{1, 2\\} \\cap \\{1, 2, 3\\}| = 2$\n-   $|S_b \\cap I| = |\\{2, 3\\} \\cap \\{1, 2, 3\\}| = 2$\n-   $|S_c \\cap I| = |\\{1, 3\\} \\cap \\{1, 2, 3\\}| = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the general form gives the specific inequality instance:\n$$ 2x_a + 2x_b + 2x_c \\ge 3 $$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$ x_a + x_b + x_c \\ge 1.5 $$\nThis inequality is valid for the LP relaxation. For the original MIP, the left-hand side, $X = x_a + x_b + x_c$, must be an integer since each $x_j$ is an integer. Therefore, for any integer solution, $X \\ge 1.5$ implies $X \\ge \\lceil 1.5 \\rceil = 2$.\n\nThe resulting strengthening valid inequality for the MIP is:\n$$ x_a + x_b + x_c \\ge 2 $$\nThis inequality is violated by the LP optimal solution $x_a = x_b = x_c = 0.5$, since $0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 < 2$. Thus, it is a strengthening cut.\n\n**3. Optimal Objective Value of the Strengthened LP**\n\nWe add the derived valid inequality to the LP relaxation to form a strengthened LP:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Minimize } \\quad & Z_{SLP} = x_a + x_b + x_c \\\\ \\text{Subject to } \\quad & x_a + x_c \\ge 1 \\\\ & x_a + x_b \\ge 1 \\\\ & x_b + x_c \\ge 1 \\\\ & x_a + x_b + x_c \\ge 2 \\\\ & 0 \\le x_a, x_b, x_c \\le 1 \\end{aligned} $$\nThe objective function is to minimize $Z_{SLP} = x_a + x_b + x_c$. The fourth constraint, $x_a + x_b + x_c \\ge 2$, directly provides a lower bound on the objective value: $Z_{SLP} \\ge 2$.\n\nTo determine if this lower bound can be achieved, we need to find if there exists a feasible solution $(x_a, x_b, x_c)$ that satisfies all constraints and achieves an objective value of $2$. Let's test if there is a feasible point on the plane $x_a + x_b + x_c = 2$.\n\nConsider the point $(x_a, x_b, x_c) = (1, 1, 0)$.\nThe objective value is $1 + 1 + 0 = 2$.\nNow, we check if this point is feasible by verifying all constraints:\n1.  $x_a + x_c = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ge 1$ (satisfied)\n2.  $x_a + x_b = 1 + 1 = 2 \\ge 1$ (satisfied)\n3.  $x_b + x_c = 1 + 0 = 1 \\ge 1$ (satisfied)\n4.  $x_a + x_b + x_c = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\ge 2$ (satisfied)\n5.  $0 \\le 1 \\le 1$, $0 \\le 1 \\le 1$, $0 \\le 0 \\le 1$ (all satisfied)\n\nSince the point $(1, 1, 0)$ is feasible and its objective value $2$ matches the lower bound for the objective function, it is an optimal solution. Therefore, the optimal objective value of the strengthened LP is $2$.\nBy symmetry, the points $(1, 0, 1)$ and $(0, 1, 1)$ are also optimal solutions, yielding the same objective value.\n\nThe optimal objective value of the strengthened LP is exactly $2$. Expressed to four significant figures, this is $2.000$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.000}\n$$", "id": "3130513"}, {"introduction": "Finding the absolute best solution to a set covering problem is NP-hard, meaning it can be prohibitively slow for large instances.

Compute the initial ratios:\n- For $S_0$: it covers $8$ new elements ($1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$), so the ratio is $10 / 8 = 1.25$.\n- For $S_1$: it covers $6$ new elements ($1,2,3,4,h_1,h_2$), so the ratio is $9 / 6 = 1.5$.\n- For $S_2$: it covers $6$ new elements ($5,6,7,8,h_1,h_2$), so the ratio is $9 / 6 = 1.5$.\n- For $S_3$: it covers $1$ new element ($h_1$), so the ratio is $6 / 1 = 6$.\n- For $S_4$: it covers $1$ new element ($h_2$), so the ratio is $6 / 1 = 6$.\n\nThe greedy rule selects $S_0$ first because $1.25$ is the smallest ratio.

The constraint $2 + \\Delta t \\leq 3$ becomes tight when $\\Delta t = 1$.\n- For $S_2$: The sum of duals is $y_2 + y_3 = (1 + \\Delta t) + 1 = 2 + \\Delta t$. The constraint $2 + \\Delta t \\leq 3$ becomes tight when $\\Delta t = 1$.\n\nBoth $S_1$ and $S_2$ become tight simultaneously at an increment of $\\Delta t=1$. The problem provides a tie-breaking rule: choose the set with the lowest index. Between $S_1$ and $S_2$, we choose $S_1$.\n1.  We apply the increment $\\Delta t = 1$ to $y_2$. The final dual variable values are:\n    - $y_1 = 1$ (unchanged).\n    - $y_2 = 1 + \\Delta t = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    - $y_3 = 1$ (unchanged).\n    So, the final dual vector is $(y_1, y_2, y_3) = (1, 2, 1)$.\n2.  We add $S_1$ to our cover.\n3.  Update the set of uncovered elements: $U' = U' \\setminus S_1 = \\{2\\} \\setminus \\{1, 2\\} = \\emptyset$.\n\nSince the set of uncovered elements is now empty, the algorithm terminates.\n\n**Final Verification:**\nThe algorithm selected sets $S_3$ and $S_1$. The final dual weights are $y_1=1$, $y_2=2$, and $y_3=1$. The problem asks to verify that for each selected set, its dual constraint is met with equality.\n- For selected set $S_1 = \\{1, 2\\}$: The dual sum is $y_1 + y_2 = 1 + 2 = 3$. This is equal to the cost $c_1=3$. The condition is satisfied.\n- For selected set $S_3 = \\{1, 3\\}$: The dual sum is $y_1 + y_3 = 1 + 1 = 2$. This is equal to the cost $c_3=2$. The condition is satisfied.\n\nThe verification is successful. The final dual weights derived from the process are $(y_1, y_2, y_3) = (1, 2, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3180697"}]}
