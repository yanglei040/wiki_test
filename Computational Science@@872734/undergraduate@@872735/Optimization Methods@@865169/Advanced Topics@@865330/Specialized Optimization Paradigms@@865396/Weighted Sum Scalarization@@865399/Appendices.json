The two objective functions are given as $f_{1}(x) = x^{2}$ and $f_{2}(x) = (x - 1)^{2}$.\n\nThe weighted sum scalarization method is used to combine these into a single-objective problem. For a weight $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, the scalarized objective function $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is defined as:\n$$g_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda f_{1}(x) + (1 - \\lambda) f_{2}(x)$$\nSubstituting the given functions:\n$$g_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda x^{2} + (1 - \\lambda) (x - 1)^{2}$$\nThe task is to find the minimizer $x^{\\ast}(\\lambda)$ for the problem $\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} g_{\\lambda}(x)$.\n\nFirst, to justify the existence and uniqueness of the minimizer, we will analyze the convexity of the function $g_{\\lambda}(x)$. A twice-differentiable function is strictly convex if its second derivative is strictly positive.\n\nThe individual objective functions $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(x)$ are twice-differentiable. Let's compute their second derivatives:\nFor $f_{1}(x) = x^{2}$, the first derivative is $f_{1}'(x) = 2x$ and the second derivative is $f_{1}''(x) = 2$.\nFor $f_{2}(x) = (x - 1)^{2}$, the first derivative is $f_{2}'(x) = 2(x - 1)$ and the second derivative is $f_{2}''(x) = 2$.\nSince $f_{1}''(x) = 2  0$ and $f_{2}''(x) = 2  0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, both $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(x)$ are strictly convex functions.\n\nThe scalarized objective $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is a linear combination of $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(x)$. Its second derivative is:\n$$g_{\\lambda}''(x) = \\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} \\left[ \\lambda f_{1}(x) + (1 - \\lambda) f_{2}(x) \\right] = \\lambda f_{1}''(x) + (1 - \\lambda) f_{2}''(x)$$\nSubstituting the values of the second derivatives:\n$$g_{\\lambda}''(x) = \\lambda (2) + (1 - \\lambda) (2) = 2\\lambda + 2 - 2\\lambda = 2$$\nSince $g_{\\lambda}''(x) = 2  0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and for any choice of $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, the function $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is strictly convex. A strictly convex function defined on a convex domain (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) has at most one global minimizer. Since $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient, it is coercive (i.e., $g_{\\lambda}(x) \\to \\infty$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$), which guarantees that a global minimum exists. Therefore, for each $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, there is a unique global minimizer, which we denote as $x^{\\ast}(\\lambda)$.\n\nTo find this unique minimizer, we apply the first-order necessary and sufficient condition for optimality for an unconstrained convex optimization problem. This condition states that the global minimizer $x^{\\ast}$ is the point where the first derivative of the objective function is zero.\n$$g_{\\lambda}'(x^{\\ast}) = 0$$\nTo facilitate differentiation, we can expand the expression for $g_{\\lambda}(x)$:\n$$g_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda x^{2} + (1 - \\lambda)(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = \\lambda x^{2} + x^{2} - 2x + 1 - \\lambda x^{2} + 2\\lambda x - \\lambda$$\n$$g_{\\lambda}(x) = x^{2} - 2(1 - \\lambda)x + (1 - \\lambda)$$\nNow, we compute the first derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$g_{\\lambda}'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ x^{2} - 2(1 - \\lambda)x + (1 - \\lambda) \\right] = 2x - 2(1 - \\lambda)$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the optimizer $x^{\\ast}(\\lambda)$:\n$$2x^{\\ast}(\\lambda) - 2(1 - \\lambda) = 0$$\n$$2x^{\\ast}(\\lambda) = 2(1 - \\lambda)$$\n$$x^{\\ast}(\\lambda) = 1 - \\lambda$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the unique optimizer as a function of the weight $\\lambda$.\n\nNext, we analyze the properties of $x^{\\ast}(\\lambda) = 1 - \\lambda$ as a function of $\\lambda$ on the interval $[0, 1]$.\nAs $\\lambda$ varies from $0$ to $1$, the optimizer $x^{\\ast}(\\lambda)$ takes values from $x^{\\ast}(0) = 1 - 0 = 1$ to $x^{\\ast}(1) = 1 - 1 = 0$. The set of all possible optimizers, known as the Pareto front in the decision space, is the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nFor monotonicity, we examine the derivative of $x^{\\ast}(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\\frac{d x^{\\ast}}{d \\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}(1 - \\lambda) = -1$$\nSince the derivative is a constant $-1$, which is strictly negative, the function $x^{\\ast}(\\lambda)$ is strictly monotonically decreasing with respect to $\\lambda$ over its domain $[0, 1]$.\n\nFor Lipschitz continuity, we must show that there exists a constant $L \\ge 0$ such that for any $\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2} \\in [0, 1]$, the inequality $|x^{\\ast}(\\lambda_{1}) - x^{\\ast}(\\lambda_{2})| \\le L |\\lambda_{1} - \\lambda_{2}|$ holds.\nLet's compute the absolute difference:\n$$|x^{\\ast}(\\lambda_{1}) - x^{\\ast}(\\lambda_{2})| = |(1 - \\lambda_{1}) - (1 - \\lambda_{2})| = |-\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}| = |\\lambda_{2} - \\lambda_{1}| = 1 \\cdot |\\lambda_{1} - \\lambda_{2}|$$\nThis identity shows that $x^{\\ast}(\\lambda)$ is Lipschitz continuous with a Lipschitz constant of $L=1$.

The feasible set is the polyhedron $\\mathcal{P} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 4,\\; 2x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 5,\\; x_{1} \\geq 0,\\; x_{2} \\geq 0\\}$. This set is defined by the intersection of four closed linear half-spaces. Since the variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ are non-negative and bounded above (e.g., $x_1 \\leq 5/2$ and $x_2 \\leq 4$), the set $\\mathcal{P}$ is a non-empty, bounded, and convex set, specifically a convex polytope in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The objective functions to be minimized are $f_{1}(x) = -x_{1}$ and $f_{2}(x) = -x_{2}$.\n\nThe weighted-sum scalarization forms a single-objective problem with the objective function $g_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda f_{1}(x) + (1-\\lambda) f_{2}(x)$ for a weight parameter $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. Substituting the given functions, we have:\n$$\ng_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda (-x_{1}) + (1-\\lambda) (-x_{2}) = -\\lambda x_{1} - (1-\\lambda) x_{2}\n$$\nFor any fixed $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is a linear function of $x = (x_1, x_2)$. Therefore, the problem $\\min_{x \\in \\mathcal{P}} g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is a Linear Programming (LP) problem.\n\nThe problem statement requires using two fundamental principles:\n\n1.  **The fundamental theorem of Linear Programming**: This theorem states that for a linear program with a non-empty feasible region that has at least one extreme point, if there is an optimal solution, then at least one extreme point (vertex) of the feasible region is optimal. Since our feasible set $\\mathcal{P}$ is a non-empty bounded polyhedron, it is a compact set, and the continuous linear function $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ must attain its minimum on $\\mathcal{P}$. By the theorem, this minimum value must be achieved at one or more of the extreme points of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\n2.  **Convexity of linear images and the supporting-hyperplane viewpoint**: The feasible set $\\mathcal{P}$ is a convex set. The level sets of the objective function $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ are lines of the form $-\\lambda x_{1} - (1-\\lambda) x_{2} = c$, where $c$ is a constant. Minimizing $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ over $\\mathcal{P}$ is geometrically equivalent to finding the smallest value of $c$ for which this line has a non-empty intersection with $\\mathcal{P}$. This line is a supporting hyperplane to the convex set $\\mathcal{P}$.\n    -   Typically, a supporting hyperplane will touch a convex polytope at a single point, which must be a vertex (an extreme point). This occurs when the gradient vector of the objective function, $\\nabla g_{\\lambda} = (-\\lambda, -(1-\\lambda))$, is not parallel to the normal of any of the bounding hyperplanes of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n    -   The exception, where the set of optimal solutions is larger than a single point, happens when the level sets of $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ are parallel to one of the edges of the polyhedron $\\mathcal{P}$. This corresponds to the gradient $\\nabla g_{\\lambda}$ being orthogonal to the direction vector of that edge. In this situation, the supporting hyperplane coincides with the entire edge. Consequently, every point on that edge, including its two endpoint vertices, is an optimal solution. This occurs for specific, non-generic values of $\\lambda$.\n\nThis completes the argument that minimizers of $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ are always found at the extreme points of $\\mathcal{P}$, and for certain values of $\\lambda$, the optimal set can extend to an entire edge.\n\nNext, we determine the breakpoint value $\\lambda^{\\star}$. The problem specifies that as $\\lambda$ increases from $0$ to $1$, the optimizer of $g_{\\lambda}$ switches from the vertex $(0,4)$ to the vertex $(1,3)$. Let's denote these vertices as $V_1 = (0,4)$ and $V_2 = (1,3)$. We can verify they are indeed extreme points of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n-   For $V_1 = (0,4)$: $0+4 = 4 \\leq 4$; $2(0)+4=4 \\leq 5$; $0 \\geq 0$; $4 \\geq 0$. All constraints are satisfied. It's the intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_1+x_2=4$.\n-   For $V_2 = (1,3)$: $1+3 = 4 \\leq 4$; $2(1)+3=5 \\leq 5$; $1 \\geq 0$; $3 \\geq 0$. All constraints are satisfied. It's the intersection of $x_1+x_2=4$ and $2x_1+x_2=5$.\n\nThe transition between two vertices as the optimal solution occurs at the precise value of $\\lambda$ where both vertices are simultaneously optimal. This means they must yield the same objective function value. This is the condition for the supporting hyperplane to be parallel to the edge connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$. We set $g_{\\lambda^{\\star}}(V_1) = g_{\\lambda^{\\star}}(V_2)$ to find the breakpoint $\\lambda^{\\star}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the objective function $g_{\\lambda}(x) = -\\lambda x_{1} - (1-\\lambda) x_{2}$ at each vertex:\n-   At $V_1 = (0,4)$:\n    $$ g_{\\lambda}(0,4) = -\\lambda(0) - (1-\\lambda)(4) = -4(1-\\lambda) = 4\\lambda - 4 $$\n-   At $V_2 = (1,3)$:\n    $$ g_{\\lambda}(1,3) = -\\lambda(1) - (1-\\lambda)(3) = -\\lambda - 3 + 3\\lambda = 2\\lambda - 3 $$\n\nNow, we set the values equal to find $\\lambda^{\\star}$:\n$$ g_{\\lambda^{\\star}}(0,4) = g_{\\lambda^{\\star}}(1,3) $$\n$$ 4\\lambda^{\\star} - 4 = 2\\lambda^{\\star} - 3 $$\n$$ 4\\lambda^{\\star} - 2\\lambda^{\\star} = 4 - 3 $$\n$$ 2\\lambda^{\\star} = 1 $$\n$$ \\lambda^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nThis value $\\lambda^{\\star}=\\frac{1}{2}$ is in the interval $(0,1)$. For $\\lambda  1/2$, we have $2\\lambda  1$, which implies $4\\lambda - 4  2\\lambda - 3$, so $g_{\\lambda}(0,4)  g_{\\lambda}(1,3)$, making $(0,4)$ the unique minimizer. For $\\lambda  1/2$, we have $2\\lambda  1$, which implies $4\\lambda - 4  2\\lambda - 3$, so $g_{\\lambda}(0,4)  g_{\\lambda}(1,3)$, making $(1,3)$ the minimizer (assuming it's better than other vertices, which a full analysis confirms). Thus, $\\lambda^{\\star} = 1/2$ is indeed the breakpoint where the optimizer switches from $(0,4)$ to $(1,3)$ as $\\lambda$ increases.

Characterization of the Pareto-Efficient Set**\n\nA solution $x^* \\in [0,1]$ is Pareto-efficient if there exists no other solution $x \\in [0,1]$ that dominates it. For a minimization problem, a solution $x$ dominates $x^*$ if $f_1(x) \\le f_1(x^*)$ and $f_2(x) \\le f_2(x^*)$, with at least one of these inequalities being strict.\n\nLet us test an arbitrary point $x_0 \\in [0,1]$ for Pareto efficiency. Suppose there exists another point $x \\in [0,1]$ that dominates $x_0$. According to the definition of dominance, the following two conditions must hold simultaneously:\n1. $f_2(x) \\le f_2(x_0) \\implies x \\le x_0$\n2. $f_1(x) \\le f_1(x_0) \\implies \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\le \\sqrt{1 - x_0^2}$\n\nSince the square root function is strictly increasing for non-negative arguments, the second inequality is equivalent to:\n$1 - x^2 \\le 1 - x_0^2$\n$-x^2 \\le -x_0^2$\n$x^2 \\ge x_0^2$\n\nBecause the decision variable $x$ is restricted to the non-negative interval $[0,1]$, taking the square root of both sides gives:\n$x \\ge x_0$\n\nFor a point $x$ to dominate $x_0$, we must have both $x \\le x_0$ and $x \\ge x_0$. This is only possible if $x = x_0$.\nIf $x = x_0$, then $f_1(x) = f_1(x_0)$ and $f_2(x) = f_2(x_0)$. In this case, both inequalities in the definition of dominance are equalities, and the condition that at least one inequality must be strict is not met.\n\nTherefore, no feasible solution $x \\in [0,1]$ can be dominated by any other feasible solution. This means that every point in the decision space $x \\in [0,1]$ is a Pareto-efficient solution. Consequently, the entire feasible set in the objective space, which is the arc $\\{(f_1(x), f_2(x)) : x \\in [0,1]\\}$, consists of non-dominated points.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Weighted Sum Scalarization**\n\nThe weighted sum scalarization method transforms the bi-objective problem into a single-objective problem by minimizing the function $g_w(x) = w_1 f_1(x) + w_2 f_2(x)$ for strictly positive weights $w_1  0$ and $w_2  0$. The function to minimize over $x \\in [0,1]$ is:\n$$\ng_w(x) = w_1 \\sqrt{1 - x^2} + w_2 x\n$$\nTo find the minimizer of $g_w(x)$ on the closed interval $[0,1]$, we first analyze its behavior on the open interval $(0,1)$ by examining its derivative. The first derivative of $g_w(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\ng_w'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( w_1 (1 - x^2)^{1/2} + w_2 x \\right) = w_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (1-x^2)^{-1/2} (-2x) \\right) + w_2 = -\\frac{w_1 x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} + w_2\n$$\nSetting $g_w'(x) = 0$ to find critical points in $(0,1)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{w_1 x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} + w_2 = 0 \\implies w_2 = \\frac{w_1 x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\n$$\nSince $w_1, w_2  0$ and $x \\in (0,1)$, we can square both sides:\n$$\nw_2^2 = \\frac{w_1^2 x^2}{1-x^2} \\implies w_2^2(1-x^2) = w_1^2 x^2 \\implies w_2^2 = (w_1^2 + w_2^2)x^2\n$$\nThis gives $x^2 = \\frac{w_2^2}{w_1^2 + w_2^2}$, and since $x0$, the unique critical point is $x_c = \\frac{w_2}{\\sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2}}$. For any $w_1, w_2  0$, we have $0  x_c  1$.\n\nTo determine if this critical point is a minimum or a maximum, we compute the second derivative:\n$$\ng_w''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -w_1 x (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} + w_2 \\right)\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule on the first term:\n$$\ng_w''(x) = -w_1 \\left[ \\frac{(1)\\sqrt{1-x^2} - x(-x/\\sqrt{1-x^2})}{1-x^2} \\right] = -w_1 \\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^2} + x^2/\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-x^2} \\right]\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{1-x^2}$:\n$$\ng_w''(x) = -w_1 \\left[ \\frac{(1-x^2) + x^2}{(1-x^2)^{3/2}} \\right] = -\\frac{w_1}{(1-x^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\nFor any $x \\in (0,1)$, the denominator $(1-x^2)^{3/2}$ is positive. Since $w_1  0$, it follows that $g_w''(x)  0$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$. A negative second derivative indicates that the function $g_w(x)$ is strictly concave on the interval $(0,1)$.\n\nFor a continuous function on a closed interval that is strictly concave on the interior, its minimum value must be attained at one of the endpoints of the interval. Therefore, the minimizer of $g_w(x)$ over $[0,1]$ must be either $x=0$ or $x=1$.\n\nThis means that for any pair of strictly positive weights $(w_1, w_2)$, the weighted sum method will only ever identify the solutions $x=0$ (objective vector $(1,0)$) or $x=1$ (objective vector $(0,1)$) as optimal. The efficient solutions corresponding to $x \\in (0,1)$ cannot be found by this method. Such points are known as unsupported efficient points, because they do not lie on the boundary of the convex hull of the feasible objective set.\n\n**3.
