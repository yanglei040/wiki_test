A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Determining the Convex Hull of S**\n\nThe set $S$ is the graph of the function $y = |x|$ for $x \\in [-1,1]$. This is the union of two line segments in $\\mathbb{R}^2$: one from $(-1,1)$ to $(0,0)$ and the other from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$. Let the vertices be $A=(-1,1)$, $C=(0,0)$, and $B=(1,1)$.\n\nThe convex hull, $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$, is the smallest convex set containing $S$. Any convex set that contains $S$ must contain its extreme points, which are $A$, $B$, and $C$. Because a convex set contains the line segment between any two of its points, it must contain the triangle formed by these three vertices. This triangle, let's call it $T$, is itself a convex set. Since $T$ contains $S$ and is contained in any convex set containing $S$, $T$ must be the convex hull of $S$. So, $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$ is the closed triangle with vertices $A(-1,1)$, $B(1,1)$, and $C(0,0)$.\n\nAs stated in the problem, a convex polygon can be represented as the intersection of a finite number of closed half-spaces. The boundaries of these half-spaces are the lines containing the facets (edges) of the polygon. We find the inequalities for the three edges of the triangle $ABC$.\n\n1.  **Edge AB**: This edge connects $A(-1,1)$ and $B(1,1)$. The line passing through these points is $y=1$. The triangle lies on or below this line. Thus, the first inequality is $y \\le 1$. The corresponding closed half-space is $H_1 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y \\le 1\\}$.\n\n2.  **Edge CB**: This edge connects $C(0,0)$ and $B(1,1)$. The line passing through these points has a slope of $\\frac{1-0}{1-0} = 1$ and passes through the origin, so its equation is $y=x$, or $y-x=0$. To determine the inequality, we test a point in the triangle's interior, e.g., $(-0.5, 0.75)$. For this point, $y-x = 0.75 - (-0.5) = 1.25$, which is positive. So, the inequality is $y-x \\ge 0$. The corresponding closed half-space is $H_2 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y-x \\ge 0\\}$.\n\n3.  **Edge AC**: This edge connects $A(-1,1)$ and $C(0,0)$. The line passing through these points has a slope of $\\frac{1-0}{-1-0} = -1$ and passes through the origin, so its equation is $y=-x$, or $y+x=0$. Using the same test point $(-0.5, 0.75)$, we have $y+x = 0.75 + (-0.5) = 0.25$, which is positive. So, the inequality is $y+x \\ge 0$. The corresponding closed half-space is $H_3 = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y+x \\ge 0\\}$.\n\nThe three facet-defining linear inequalities that describe $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$ are:\n$$\ny \\le 1\n$$\n$$\ny-x \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\ny+x \\ge 0\n$$\nThese three inequalities together define the convex hull $\\operatorname{conv}(S) = \\{(x,y) \\mid y \\le 1, y \\ge x, y \\ge -x\\}$. Note that these constraints imply $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ and $0 \\le y \\le 1$.\n\n**Part 2: Solving the Linear Programming Relaxation**\n\nThe original nonconvex problem is:\n$$\n\\min_{x,y} \\;\\; -y + 2x \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad (x,y) \\in S, \\; x + y \\ge \\tfrac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThe constraint $(x,y) \\in S$ implies $y=|x|$ and $x \\in [-1,1]$. We create the linear programming (LP) relaxation by replacing the nonconvex set $S$ with its convex hull, $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$. The constraint $x \\in [-1,1]$ is implicitly included in the description of $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$. The LP relaxation is:\n$$\n\\min_{x,y} \\;\\; f(x,y) = 2x - y\n$$\nsubject to:\n1.  $y \\le 1$\n2.  $y - x \\ge 0$\n3.  $y + x \\ge 0$\n4.  $x + y \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThe feasible region is a compact convex polygon. The minimum of the linear objective function $f(x,y)$ will be attained at one of the vertices of this polygon. The vertices are found by taking the boundary lines of the inequalities pairwise and solving for their intersection points, then checking if these points satisfy all four inequalities.\n\nThe boundary lines are:\n$L_1: y = 1$\n$L_2: y = x$\n$L_3: y = -x$\n$L_4: x + y = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nLet's find the vertices:\n-   **Intersection of $L_1$ and $L_2$**: $y=1, y=x \\implies (x,y) = (1,1)$.\n    Check feasibility: $1 \\le 1$ (ok), $1-1 \\ge 0$ (ok), $1+1 \\ge 0$ (ok), $1+1 \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$ (ok). This point, $V_1=(1,1)$, is a vertex. Objective value: $f(1,1) = 2(1)-1=1$.\n\n-   **Intersection of $L_1$ and $L_4$**: $y=1, x+y=\\frac{1}{2} \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2}-1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Point is $(-\\frac{1}{2},1)$.\n    Check feasibility: $1 \\le 1$ (ok), $1-(-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{3}{2} \\ge 0$ (ok), $1+(-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ge 0$ (ok), $-\\frac{1}{2}+1 \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$ (ok). This point, $V_2=(-\\frac{1}{2},1)$, is a vertex. Objective value: $f(-\\frac{1}{2},1) = 2(-\\frac{1}{2})-1 = -1-1 = -2$.\n\n-   **Intersection of $L_2$ and $L_4$**: $y=x, x+y=\\frac{1}{2} \\implies x+x=\\frac{1}{2} \\implies 2x=\\frac{1}{2} \\implies x=\\frac{1}{4}$. Point is $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$.\n    Check feasibility: $\\frac{1}{4} \\le 1$ (ok), $\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{4} \\ge 0$ (ok), $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4} \\ge 0$ (ok), $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$ (ok). This point, $V_3=(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$, is a vertex. Objective value: $f(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = 2(\\frac{1}{4})-\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n-   Other possible intersections are not feasible. For example, $L_2 \\cap L_3$ is $(0,0)$, which violates $x+y \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$. $L_1 \\cap L_3$ is $(-1,1)$, which also violates $x+y \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$ as $-1+1=0 < \\frac{1}{2}$. $L_3$ and $L_4$ have the same slope ($-1$) and are parallel, so they do not intersect.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are $V_1(1,1)$, $V_2(-\\frac{1}{2},1)$, and $V_3(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$. We evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n- $f(V_1) = 1$\n- $f(V_2) = -2$\n- $f(V_3) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe minimum value among these is $-2$. Therefore, the optimal objective value of the linear programming relaxation is $-2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2}\n$$", "id": "3114127"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of convex relaxation, we now tackle a more advanced and widely applicable case: the bilinear constraint $z=xy$.

We proceed with the solution in three parts: first, deriving the convex hull; second, solving the two optimization problems; and third, computing the optimality gap.\n\nFirst, we derive the convex hull of the set $S = \\{(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : z=xy, x \\in [\\ell_x, u_x], y \\in [\\ell_y, u_y]\\}$. This is known as the McCormick convex envelope. The convex hull is the tightest convex set containing $S$ and is described by the original box constraints on $x$ and $y$ along with four linear inequalities. We derive these inequalities.\n\nThe bilinear term $z=xy$ is nonconvex. Its convex envelope is defined by two convex underestimators and two concave overestimators.\n1. Consider the expression $(x-\\ell_x)(y-\\ell_y)$. Since $x \\ge \\ell_x$ and $y \\ge \\ell_y$, this product is non-negative:\n$$\n(x-\\ell_x)(y-\\ell_y) \\ge 0 \\implies xy - \\ell_x y - \\ell_y x + \\ell_x \\ell_y \\ge 0\n$$\nSince $z=xy$ on the set $S$, this implies $z \\ge \\ell_y x + \\ell_x y - \\ell_x \\ell_y$. This inequality is linear in $x$, $y$, and $z$, defining a half-space. This half-space contains $S$ and is a convex underestimator of $z$.\n\n2. Similarly, consider $(u_x-x)(u_y-y)$. Since $x \\le u_x$ and $y \\le u_y$, this product is also non-negative:\n$$\n(u_x-x)(u_y-y) \\ge 0 \\implies u_x u_y - u_x y - u_y x + xy \\ge 0\n$$\nThis implies $z \\ge u_y x + u_x y - u_x u_y$. This is the second convex underestimator.\n\n3. Now consider $(x-\\ell_x)(u_y-y)$. Since $x \\ge \\ell_x$ and $y \\le u_y$, this product is non-negative:\n$$\n(x-\\ell_x)(u_y-y) \\ge 0 \\implies u_y x - xy - \\ell_x u_y + \\ell_x y \\ge 0\n$$\nThis implies $z \\le u_y x + \\ell_x y - \\ell_x u_y$. This is a concave overestimator.\n\n4. Finally, consider $(u_x-x)(y-\\ell_y)$. Since $x \\le u_x$ and $y \\ge \\ell_y$, this product is non-negative:\n$$\n(u_x-x)(y-\\ell_y) \\ge 0 \\implies u_x y - u_x \\ell_y - xy + \\ell_y x \\ge 0\n$$\nThis implies $z \\le \\ell_y x + u_x y - u_x \\ell_y$. This is the second concave overestimator.\n\nThe convex hull of $S$, denoted $\\text{conv}(S)$, is the region in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx & \\in [\\ell_x, u_x] \\\\\ny & \\in [\\ell_y, u_y] \\\\\nz & \\ge \\ell_y x + \\ell_x y - \\ell_x \\ell_y \\\\\nz & \\ge u_y x + u_x y - u_x u_y \\\\\nz & \\le u_y x + \\ell_x y - \\ell_x u_y \\\\\nz & \\le \\ell_y x + u_x y - u_x \\ell_y\n\\end{align*}\nAny point in $\\text{conv}(S)$ is a convex combination of points in $S$. Since each point in $S$ satisfies these four inequalities, and the inequalities themselves define a convex set (intersection of half-spaces), any convex combination of points from $S$ will also satisfy these inequalities. Thus, this set of inequalities correctly describes the convex hull.\n\nNext, we solve the original nonconvex optimization problem:\n$$\n\\max\\; z \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad z=xy,\\; x+y=4,\\; x\\in[0,4],\\; y\\in[0,4].\n$$\nWe substitute the linear constraint $y=4-x$ into the equation for $z$:\n$$\nz = x(4-x) = 4x - x^2\n$$\nThe problem becomes maximizing the function $f(x) = 4x - x^2$ over the interval $x \\in [0,4]$. The constraint on $y$, $y \\in [0,4]$, becomes $4-x \\in [0,4]$, which implies $x \\in [0,4]$, so no new restriction is added.\nTo find the maximum of the concave quadratic function $f(x)$, we take the derivative and set it to zero:\n$$\nf'(x) = 4 - 2x = 0 \\implies x = 2\n$$\nSince $x=2$ lies in the interval $[0,4]$, it is a candidate for the maximum. The second derivative is $f''(x) = -2 < 0$, confirming a maximum. At $x=2$, the value of $z$ is $z = 4(2) - 2^2 = 8-4=4$. The corresponding value of $y$ is $y=4-2=2$.\nThe optimal objective value of the nonconvex problem is $z^{\\star} = 4$.\n\nNow, we form the convex relaxation. We replace the nonconvex constraint $z=xy$ with its convex envelope for the bounds $\\ell_x=0$, $u_x=4$, $\\ell_y=0$, $u_y=4$. The problem becomes:\n$$\n\\max\\; z\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nz & \\ge 0 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y - 0 \\cdot 0 \\implies z \\ge 0 \\\\\nz & \\ge 4x + 4y - 4 \\cdot 4 \\implies z \\ge 4(x+y) - 16 \\\\\nz & \\le 4x + 0 \\cdot y - 0 \\cdot 4 \\implies z \\le 4x \\\\\nz & \\le 0 \\cdot x + 4y - 4 \\cdot 0 \\implies z \\le 4y \\\\\nx &+ y = 4 \\\\\nx & \\in [0,4], \\quad y \\in [0,4]\n\\end{align*}\nWe can simplify these constraints using $x+y=4$. The second inequality becomes $z \\ge 4(4) - 16 \\implies z \\ge 0$, which is the same as the first inequality.\nSubstituting $y=4-x$ into the overestimators, we get:\n$$\nz \\le 4x\n$$\n$$\nz \\le 4(4-x) = 16 - 4x\n$$\nThe relaxed problem is a linear program:\n$$\n\\max\\; z \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad z \\le 4x, \\quad z \\le 16 - 4x, \\quad x \\in [0,4].\n$$\nTo maximize $z$, for any given $x$, we must have $z \\le \\min(4x, 16-4x)$. Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding:\n$$\n\\max_{x \\in [0,4]} \\min(4x, 16-4x)\n$$\nThe maximum of $\\min(f_1(x), f_2(x))$ often occurs where $f_1(x) = f_2(x)$.

The maximum is therefore at $x=2$.\nAt $x=2$, the maximum value of $z$ is $4(2) = 8$.\nThe optimal value of the convex relaxation is $z_{\\mathrm{MC}} = 8$.\n\nFinally, we compute the multiplicative optimality gap $G$:\n$$\nG = \\frac{z_{\\mathrm{MC}}}{z^{\\star}} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3114152"}]}
