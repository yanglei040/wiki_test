All definitions ($f(x)$, epigraph, convexity, closed convex envelope) are standard and mathematically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The function $f$ is well-defined. At $x=0$, the two pieces of the definition agree: $(0+1)^{2}=1$ and $(0-1)^{2}=1$, so $f(0)=1$. The function is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. The questions posed are precise and lead to a unique, meaningful solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem statement is formal and devoid of any subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is mathematically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n**1) Demonstration of Non-Convexity**\n\nA function $f$ is convex if for any $x_1, x_2$ in its domain and any $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, the inequality $f(\\lambda x_1 + (1-\\lambda) x_2) \\leq \\lambda f(x_1) + (1-\\lambda) f(x_2)$ holds. To show $f$ is not convex, we must find a counterexample.\n\nLet us choose $x_1 = -1$ and $x_2 = 1$.\nThe values of the function at these points are:\n$f(-1) = (-1+1)^{2} = 0^{2} = 0$.\n$f(1) = (1-1)^{2} = 0^{2} = 0$.\n\nNow, let us choose $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2} \\in (0,1)$. The convex combination of the points is:\n$\\lambda x_1 + (1-\\lambda) x_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(-1) + (1-\\frac{1}{2})(1) = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 0$.\n\nWe evaluate the function at this point:\n$f(0) = (0+1)^2 = 1$ (using the $x \\le 0$ case; the $x \\ge 0$ case gives the same result).\n\nNow we check the convexity inequality:\n$f(\\lambda x_1 + (1-\\lambda) x_2) \\leq \\lambda f(x_1) + (1-\\lambda) f(x_2)$\n$f(0) \\leq \\frac{1}{2} f(-1) + \\frac{1}{2} f(1)$\n$1 \\leq \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(0)$\n$1 \\leq 0$\n\nThis inequality is false. Since we have found a counterexample, the function $f$ is not convex.\n\n**2) The Epigraph of $f$**\n\nThe epigraph of a function $f$ is the set of points lying on or above its graph. Using the definition $\\operatorname{epi} f=\\{(x,t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:t\\geq f(x)\\}$ and the piecewise definition of $f(x)$, we can write $\\operatorname{epi} f$ as the union of two sets:\n$\\operatorname{epi} f = \\{(x,t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid (x\\leq 0 \\text{ and } t\\geq (x+1)^{2}) \\text{ or } (x > 0 \\text{ and } t\\geq (x-1)^{2})\\}$.\nSince the definition for $x\\ge 0$ is also valid at $x=0$, we can express this equivalently as:\n$\\operatorname{epi} f = \\{(x,t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid (x\\leq 0 \\land t\\geq (x+1)^{2}) \\lor (x\\geq 0 \\land t\\geq (x-1)^{2}) \\}$. At $x=0$, both conditions simplify to $t \\ge 1$, showing consistency.\n\n**3) The Closed Convex Envelope $\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f$ and its Epigraph**\n\nThe closed convex envelope $\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f$ is the greatest convex lower semicontinuous function that is less than or equal to $f$. Geometrically, its epigraph, $\\operatorname{epi}(\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f)$, is the closed convex hull of $\\operatorname{epi} f$.\n\nThe graph of $f$ consists of two parabolic arcs, one with a minimum at $(-1,0)$ and the other with a minimum at $(1,0)$. The non-convexity is due to the region between these two minima. The convex hull of $\\operatorname{epi} f$ will \"fill in\" this region. The \"filling\" is achieved by the line segment connecting the points $(-1, f(-1)) = (-1,0)$ and $(1, f(1)) = (1,0)$. This segment is described by $t=0$ for $x \\in [-1,1]$.\n\nLet's define a function $g(x)$ based on this geometric intuition:\n$$\ng(x) = \\begin{cases}\n(x+1)^{2}, & x < -1 \\\\\n0, & -1 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\\\\n(x-1)^{2}, & x > 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe must verify that $g(x) = \\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x)$.\n\nFirst, we check that $g(x)$ has the required properties:\n-   **Is $g(x)$ LSC?** Yes, $g(x)$ is continuous for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, which is a stronger condition than being LSC. Continuity at $x=-1$: $\\lim_{x\\to-1^-} (x+1)^2 = 0 = g(-1)$. Continuity at $x=1$: $\\lim_{x\\to1^+} (x-1)^2 = 0 = g(1)$.\n-   **Is $g(x)$ convex?** We can check its first derivative.\n    $$\n    g'(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    2(x+1), & x < -1 \\\\\n    0, & -1 < x < 1 \\\\\n    2(x-1), & x > 1\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    At $x=-1$ and $x=1$, the left and right derivatives are $0$, so $g'(x)$ exists and is $0$ at these points. The function $g'(x)$ is non-decreasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, which implies that $g(x)$ is convex.\n-   **Is $g(x) \\leq f(x)$ for all $x$?**\n    -   For $x < -1$: $g(x)=(x+1)^2$. The original function is $f(x)=(x+1)^2$ for $x\\leq 0$, so $g(x)=f(x)$ for $x<-1$.\n    -   For $x > 1$: $g(x)=(x-1)^2$. The original function is $f(x)=(x-1)^2$ for $x\\geq 0$, so $g(x)=f(x)$ for $x>1$.\n    -   For $x \\in [-1,1]$: $g(x)=0$. For the original function, $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$ because it is a square. So $g(x) \\le f(x)$ on this interval.\n    Thus, $g(x) \\le f(x)$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow we must show that $g(x)$ is the *supremum* of all such functions. Let $h(x)$ be any convex LSC function such that $h(x) \\leq f(x)$ for all $x$. We need to show $h(x) \\leq g(x)$ for all $x$.\n-   For $x \\notin [-1,1]$, $g(x)=f(x)$, so the condition $h(x) \\le f(x)$ implies $h(x) \\le g(x)$.\n-   For $x \\in [-1,1]$, we have $h(-1) \\le f(-1) = 0$ and $h(1) \\le f(1) = 0$. By convexity of $h$, any point on the chord connecting $(-1, h(-1))$ and $(1, h(1))$ must lie above the graph of $h$. For any $x \\in [-1,1]$, we can write $x = \\lambda(-1) + (1-\\lambda)(1)$ for $\\lambda = \\frac{1-x}{2} \\in [0,1]$.\n    Then $h(x) \\leq \\lambda h(-1) + (1-\\lambda)h(1) \\leq \\lambda(0) + (1-\\lambda)(0) = 0$.\n    On this interval, $g(x)=0$, so we have shown $h(x) \\leq g(x)$.\n\nTherefore, $g(x)$ is indeed the closed convex envelope of $f(x)$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n(x+1)^{2}, & x < -1 \\\\\n0, & -1 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\\\\n(x-1)^{2}, & x > 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe epigraph of the closed convex envelope is:\n$\\operatorname{epi} \\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f = \\{(x,t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid t \\geq \\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x)\\}$. Explicitly, this is:\n$\\operatorname{epi} \\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f = \\{(x,t)\\mid (x<-1 \\land t \\ge (x+1)^2) \\lor (-1 \\le x \\le 1 \\land t \\ge 0) \\lor (x>1 \\land t \\ge (x-1)^2) \\}$.\n\n**4) Geometric Comparison of Epigraphs**\n\n-   $\\operatorname{epi} f$ is a non-convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It is the region above the graph of $f(x)$, which is formed by two parabolic curves meeting at a \"peak\" at $(0,1)$.\n-   $\\operatorname{epi} \\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f$ is a convex set. It is the closed convex hull of $\\operatorname{epi} f$.\n-   The set $\\operatorname{epi} \\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f$ can be obtained by taking the union of $\\operatorname{epi} f$ and the region that \"fills in\" the non-convex part. This added region is the set of points $(x,t)$ such that $x \\in (-1,1)$ and $\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x) \\leq t < f(x)$.\n-   Specifically, the difference $\\operatorname{epi} \\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f \\setminus \\operatorname{epi} f$ corresponds to the points $(x,t)$ for which $t \\ge \\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x)$ but it is not true that $t \\ge f(x)$. This means $\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x) \\le t < f(x)$. This can only happen where $\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x) < f(x)$, which is on the interval $(-1,1)$.\n-   So, the added region is $\\{(x,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid -1 < x < 1 \\text{ and } 0 \\leq t < f(x)\\}$. Geometrically, this is the area bounded below by the $x$-axis on the interval $(-1,1)$ and bounded above by the graph of $f(x)$.\n\n**Final Computation of the Integral**\n\nWe are asked to compute $I=\\int_{-1}^{1}\\left(\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x)-f(x)\\right)\\,dx$.\nOver the interval of integration $x \\in [-1, 1]$, we have determined that $\\operatorname{cl\\,conv} f(x) = 0$.\nThe integral simplifies to:\n$$\nI = \\int_{-1}^{1} (0 - f(x)) \\,dx = - \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) \\,dx\n$$\nWe must split the integral according to the piecewise definition of $f(x)$:\n$$\nI = - \\left( \\int_{-1}^{0} f(x) \\,dx + \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\,dx \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f(x)$:\n$$\nI = - \\left( \\int_{-1}^{0} (x+1)^{2} \\,dx + \\int_{0}^{1} (x-1)^{2} \\,dx \\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate each integral separately.\nFor the first integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{0} (x+1)^{2} \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{(x+1)^{3}}{3} \\right]_{-1}^{0} = \\frac{(0+1)^{3}}{3} - \\frac{(-1+1)^{3}}{3} = \\frac{1^{3}}{3} - \\frac{0^{3}}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nFor the second integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} (x-1)^{2} \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{(x-1)^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{(1-1)^{3}}{3} - \\frac{(0-1)^{3}}{3} = \\frac{0^{3}}{3} - \\frac{(-1)^{3}}{3} = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $I$:\n$$\nI = - \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = - \\frac{2}{3}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}\n$$", "id": "3125694"}, {"introduction": "Many functions in optimization are constructed from simpler pieces, with the pointwise maximum being a key operation.

Epigraph as an Intersection**\n\nBy definition, the epigraph of a function $g$ is the set $\\operatorname{epi} g = \\{(x,t) \\mid t \\ge g(x)\\}$. For the function $f(x)$, its epigraph is:\n$$ \\operatorname{epi} f = \\{(x,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid t \\ge f(x)\\} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $f(x)$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{epi} f = \\{(x,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid t \\ge \\max\\{x^{2}, 2|x|\\}\\} $$\nThe inequality $t \\ge \\max\\{a,b\\}$ holds if and only if $t \\ge a$ and $t \\ge b$. Applying this principle, the condition for $(x,t)$ to be in $\\operatorname{epi} f$ is equivalent to the system of two inequalities:\n$$ t \\ge x^{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t \\ge 2|x| $$\nThe set of points satisfying $t \\ge x^2$ is precisely the epigraph of $f_1(x)=x^2$, which is $\\operatorname{epi} f_1 = \\{(x,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid t \\ge x^2\\}$.\nThe set of points satisfying $t \\ge 2|x|$ is the epigraph of $f_2(x)=2|x|$, which is $\\operatorname{epi} f_2 = \\{(x,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid t \\ge 2|x|\\}$.\nTherefore, $\\operatorname{epi} f$ is the intersection of these two sets:\n$$ \\operatorname{epi} f = \\operatorname{epi} f_1 \\cap \\operatorname{epi} f_2 $$\nIn set-builder notation, this intersection is explicitly written as:\n$$ \\operatorname{epi} f = \\{(x,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid t \\ge x^{2} \\text{ and } t \\ge 2|x|\\} $$\n\n**2. Kink Points (Points of Non-Differentiability)**\n\nA point of non-differentiability for $f(x) = \\max\\{f_1(x), f_2(x)\\}$ can occur where one of the component functions is not differentiable, or where the active branch of the maximum function switches.\n\nFirst, we analyze the differentiability of the component functions.\n-   $f_1(x) = x^2$ is a polynomial and is differentiable everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$. Its derivative is $f_1'(x) = 2x$.\n-   $f_2(x) = 2|x|$ is not differentiable at $x=0$. The left-hand derivative is $\\lim_{h\\to 0^-}\\frac{2|h|-0}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^-}\\frac{-2h}{h} = -2$, and the right-hand derivative is $\\lim_{h\\to 0^+}\\frac{2|h|-0}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0^+}\\frac{2h}{h} = 2$.\n\nThe points where the active branch might switch are found by solving $f_1(x) = f_2(x)$:\n$$ x^2 = 2|x| $$\nSince $x^2 = |x|^2$, the equation becomes $|x|^2 - 2|x| = 0$, which factors as $|x|(|x|-2)=0$. The solutions are $|x|=0$ (i.e., $x=0$) and $|x|=2$ (i.e., $x=2$ and $x=-2$).\nThe set of potential kink points is therefore $\\{-2, 0, 2\\}$.\n\nTo analyze differentiability at these points, we first express $f(x)$ in a piecewise form by determining which function is greater in the intervals defined by these points.\n-   For $|x| < 2$, we have $|x|-2 < 0$. Multiplying by $|x| \\ge 0$ gives $|x|^2 - 2|x| \\le 0$, so $x^2 \\le 2|x|$. Thus, $f(x)=2|x|$ for $x \\in [-2,2]$.\n-   For $|x| > 2$, we have $|x|-2 > 0$. Multiplying by $|x| > 0$ gives $|x|^2 - 2|x| > 0$, so $x^2 > 2|x|$. Thus, $f(x)=x^2$ for $|x| \\ge 2$.\n\nThis gives the piecewise definition:\n$$ f(x) = \\begin{cases} x^2 & \\text{if } x \\le -2 \\\\ -2x & \\text{if } -2 < x < 0 \\\\ 2x & \\text{if } 0 \\le x < 2 \\\\ x^2 & \\text{if } x \\ge 2 \\end{cases} $$\nNow we check the one-sided derivatives at each potential kink point:\n-   At $x=-2$:\n    -   Left-hand derivative: $\\lim_{x \\to -2^-} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -2^-} (x^2)' = \\lim_{x \\to -2^-} 2x = 2(-2) = -4$.\n    -   Right-hand derivative: $\\lim_{x \\to -2^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -2^+} (-2x)' = -2$.\n    Since $-4 \\neq -2$, $f$ is not differentiable at $x=-2$.\n\n-   At $x=0$:\n    -   Left-hand derivative: $\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} (-2x)' = -2$.\n    -   Right-hand derivative: $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} (2x)' = 2$.\n    Since $-2 \\neq 2$, $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$. This is expected, as $f(x) = 2|x|$ in a neighborhood of $x=0$.\n\n-   At $x=2$:\n    -   Left-hand derivative: $\\lim_{x \\to 2^-} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 2^-} (2x)' = 2$.\n    -   Right-hand derivative: $\\lim_{x \\to 2^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 2^+} (x^2)' = \\lim_{x \\to 2^+} 2x = 2(2) = 4$.\n    Since $2 \\neq 4$, $f$ is not differentiable at $x=2$.\n\nThe set of all points where $f$ fails to be differentiable is $\\{-2, 0, 2\\}$.\n\n**3. Relevance of Kink Points to Minimization**\n\nWe must solve the unconstrained minimization problem $\\min_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}} f(x)$.\nThe function is $f(x) = \\max\\{x^2, 2|x|\\}$. Since $x^2 \\ge 0$ and $2|x| \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, their maximum $f(x)$ must also be non-negative, i.e., $f(x) \\ge 0$.\nThe value $f(x)=0$ is achieved if and only if both $x^2=0$ and $2|x|=0$, which occurs uniquely at $x=0$.\nAt this point, $f(0) = \\max\\{0^2, 2|0|\\} = 0$.\nSince $f(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$ and $f(0)=0$, the global minimum of $f$ is $0$, attained at the optimizer $x^*=0$.\n\nThe optimizer $x^*=0$ is one of the kink points. Therefore, this kink point is centrally relevant to the minimization problem as it is the location of the solution.\nFor a convex function such as $f$ (being the pointwise maximum of convex functions), the global minimum occurs at a point $x^*$ where the subgradient contains zero, i.e., $0 \\in \\partial f(x^*)$.\n-   At $x=0$, the subgradient is the interval defined by the left and right derivatives, $\\partial f(0) = [-2, 2]$. Since $0 \\in [-2, 2]$, $x=0$ is a minimizer.\n-   At $x=2$, the subgradient is $\\partial f(2) = [2, 4]$. Since $0 \\notin [2, 4]$, $x=2$ is not a minimizer.\n-   At $x=-2$, the subgradient is $\\partial f(-2) = [-4, -2]$. Since $0 \\notin [-4, -2]$, $x=-2$ is not a minimizer.\n\nThus, the only kink point that corresponds to an optimizer is $x=0$. The analysis of kink points is essential because the minimum does not occur at a stationary point (where a derivative would be zero), but rather at a point of non-differentiability.\n\nThe final answer requires the set of all kink points. These are $x=-2$, $x=0$, and $x=2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "3125707"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical concept of an epigraph becomes a practical tool when it can be described using standard geometric forms recognized by optimization solvers.

It is mathematically and scientifically sound, complete, and well-posed. The inclusion of the SOC definition is extraneous but does not create a conflict or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Rotated Second-Order Cone Representation**\n\nThe epigraph of the function $q(x,\\tau) = \\|x\\|_2^2/\\tau$ is defined by the set of points $(x,\\tau,t)$ that satisfy the inequality:\n$$t \\geq \\frac{\\|x\\|_2^2}{\\tau}$$\nThe domain of the function specifies that $\\tau > 0$. Since $\\tau$ is strictly positive, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $\\tau$ without changing its direction:\n$$\\tau t \\geq \\|x\\|_2^2$$\nAdditionally, for any point in the epigraph, since $\\|x\\|_2^2 \\ge 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, it follows that $t \\ge \\|x\\|_2^2/\\tau \\ge 0$, so $t$ is always non-negative.\n\nThe Rotated Second-Order Cone (RSOC), $\\mathcal{Q}_r$, is defined by the set of points $(u,v,w)$ satisfying three conditions:\n$1.$ $u \\ge 0$\n$2.$ $v \\ge 0$\n$3.$ $2uv \\ge \\|w\\|_2^2$\n\nWe seek a linear embedding that maps the variables $(x, \\tau, t)$ to $(u, v, w)$ such that the condition $(x, \\tau, t) \\in \\mathrm{epi}(q)$ is equivalent to $(u, v, w) \\in \\mathcal{Q}_r$.\n\nLet's compare the core inequalities:\n-   Epigraph: $\\tau t \\geq \\|x\\|_2^2$\n-   RSOC: $2uv \\geq \\|w\\|_2^2$\n\nA direct comparison suggests identifying $\\|w\\|_2^2$ with $\\|x\\|_2^2$. The simplest linear mapping to achieve this is $w=x$.\nThis leaves us with the task of relating $2uv$ to $\\tau t$. We need to define $u$ and $v$ as linear functions of $\\tau$ and $t$ such that $2uv = \\tau t$.\n\nA suitable linear mapping is:\n-   $u = \\frac{\\tau}{2}$\n-   $v = t$\n-   $w = x$\n\nLet's verify that this mapping establishes the desired equivalence for the domain $\\tau > 0$.\n\nFirst, assume $(x, \\tau, t) \\in \\mathrm{epi}(q)$. This means $\\tau > 0$ and $t \\ge \\|x\\|_2^2/\\tau$.\nWe check if the corresponding point $(u,v,w) = (\\tau/2, t, x)$ is in $\\mathcal{Q}_r$.\n$1.$ $u = \\tau/2$. Since $\\tau > 0$, we have $u > 0$, which satisfies $u \\ge 0$.\n$2.$ $v = t$. Since $t \\ge \\|x\\|_2^2/\\tau \\ge 0$, we have $v \\ge 0$.\n$3.$ The inequality $\\tau t \\ge \\|x\\|_2^2$ is directly given. We can rewrite it as $2(\\tau/2)t \\ge \\|x\\|_2^2$. Substituting our definitions for $u, v, w$, this becomes $2uv \\ge \\|w\\|_2^2$.\nTherefore, if $(x, \\tau, t) \\in \\mathrm{epi}(q)$, then $(\\tau/2, t, x) \\in \\mathcal{Q}_r$.\n\nSecond, assume $(\\tau/2, t, x) \\in \\mathcal{Q}_r$ and $\\tau > 0$. The conditions for being in $\\mathcal{Q}_r$ are $u = \\tau/2 \\ge 0$, $v = t \\ge 0$, and $2uv = 2(\\tau/2)t = \\tau t \\ge \\|x\\|_2^2$.\nThe condition $\\tau > 0$ is given by the domain of $q$. Since $\\tau > 0$, we can divide the inequality $\\tau t \\ge \\|x\\|_2^2$ by $\\tau$ to get $t \\ge \\|x\\|_2^2/\\tau$.\nThis is precisely the definition of $(x, \\tau, t)$ being in the epigraph of $q$.\n\nThus, the condition $(x, \\tau, t) \\in \\mathrm{epi}(q)$ is equivalent to the condition that the linearly transformed point $(\\tau/2, t, x)$ belongs to the Rotated Second-Order Cone, $\\mathcal{Q}_r$.\n\n**Computation for Specific Data**\n\nWe are given the specific data $x = (3, -4, 12) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\\tau = 7.5$. We need to find the minimal value of $t$ such that the point $(x, \\tau, t)$ lies in the epigraph.\nThe minimal value of $t$, let's call it $t_{\\min}$, occurs when the point is on the boundary of the epigraph, i.e., when the inequality becomes an equality:\n$$t_{\\min} = \\frac{\\|x\\|_2^2}{\\tau}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the squared Euclidean norm of $x$:\n$$\\|x\\|_2^2 = 3^2 + (-4)^2 + 12^2 = 9 + 16 + 144 = 169$$\n\nNext, we substitute this value and the given value of $\\tau$ into the expression for $t_{\\min}$:\n$$\\tau = 7.5 = \\frac{15}{2}$$\n$$t_{\\min} = \\frac{169}{7.5} = \\frac{169}{15/2} = \\frac{169 \\times 2}{15} = \\frac{338}{15}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$t_{\\min} = \\frac{338}{15} = 22.53333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $2$, $5$, and $3$. The fifth significant figure is $3$. Since $3 < 5$, we round down.\nThe minimal value of $t$ rounded to four significant figures is $22.53$.\nThis calculation is consistent with using the derived RSOC representation. The minimal $t$ corresponds to the boundary of the cone, $2uv = \\|w\\|_2^2$, which gives $2(\\tau/2) t = \\|x\\|_2^2$, or $\\tau t = \\|x\\|_2^2$, leading to the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.53}$$", "id": "3125693"}]}
