This practice places you in the role of an engineer designing a lane-change maneuver for a self-driving car.

The car's lateral displacement from the centerline of its original lane is described by a function $y(t)$, where $t$ is the time elapsed since the maneuver began. The entire maneuver takes a total time $T$ to complete.\n\nThe design specifications for the maneuver are as follows:\n1.  At the start of the maneuver ($t=0$), the car is at the centerline of its original lane.\n2.  At the start of the maneuver ($t=0$), the car is traveling parallel to the lane lines, meaning its initial lateral velocity is zero.\n3.  At the end of the maneuver ($t=T$), the car is at the centerline of the adjacent lane, which is a lateral distance $W$ away.\n4.  At the end of the maneuver ($t=T$), the car is again traveling parallel to the lane lines, so its final lateral velocity is also zero.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, the algorithm models the path $y(t)$ using the unique cubic polynomial that satisfies these four conditions.

Fix two overlapping intervals $[a,b]$ and $[c,d]$ with nontrivial overlap. Then $f$ equals a polynomial of degree at most $3$ on $[a,b]$ (namely $p_{a,b}$) and also equals a polynomial of degree at most $3$ on $[c,d]$ (namely $p_{c,d}$). On the overlap, both polynomials agree with $f$, hence they agree with each other on infinitely many points; therefore they are identical as polynomials. Since this holds for any pair of overlapping intervals, a single global polynomial of degree at most $3$ represents $f$ everywhere. Thus $f$ must be a polynomial with $\\deg f\\leq 3$.\n\nEquivalently, if $f$ is sufficiently smooth, the standard Hermite error formula gives\n$$\nf(x)-p_{a,b}(x)=\\frac{f^{(4)}(\\xi_{x})}{4!}\\,(x-a)^{2}(x-b)^{2},\n$$\nfor some $\\xi_{x}\\in(a,b)$.
