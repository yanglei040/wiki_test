It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in numerical analysis, with all necessary data and definitions provided. The task is to conduct a numerical experiment comparing the conditioning of design matrices derived from a monomial basis (Vandermonde matrix) and an orthogonal polynomial basis (Legendre polynomials).\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing a numerical procedure that, for each specified test case, calculates the required ratio of condition numbers. The methodology is as follows:\n\nFirst, for each test case, we are given a polynomial degree $m$, a number of sample points $n$, and a set of nodes $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$. We construct two design matrices of size $n \\times (m+1)$.\n\nThe first matrix is the Vandermonde matrix, $V$, which arises from using the monomial basis $\\{1, x, x^2, \\dots, x^m\\}$. The entry in the $i$-th row and $k$-th column (using 0-based indexing for rows and columns) of $V$ is given by:\n$$\nV_{i,k} = x_i^k \\quad \\text{for } i=0, \\dots, n-1 \\text{ and } k=0, \\dots, m.\n$$\nThis matrix is constructed for the given node set $\\{x_i\\}$.\n\nThe second matrix is the Legendre design matrix, $L$, which arises from using the Legendre polynomial basis $\\{P_0(x), P_1(x), \\dots, P_m(x)\\}$. The entries of $L$ are given by:\n$$\nL_{i,k} = P_k(x_i) \\quad \\text{for } i=0, \\dots, n-1 \\text{ and } k=0, \\dots, m.\n$$\nThe values of the Legendre polynomials $P_k(x_i)$ are computed numerically. The first two polynomials are defined as $P_0(x) = 1$ and $P_1(x) = x$. Subsequent polynomials for $k \\ge 1$ are generated using the specified three-term recurrence relation:\n$$\n(k+1) P_{k+1}(x) = (2k+1) x P_k(x) - k P_{k-1}(x).\n$$\nThis recurrence is applied iteratively for $k=1, 2, \\dots, m-1$ to compute the values of all necessary basis polynomials at each node $x_i$, thereby populating the columns of the matrix $L$.\n\nNext, the spectral condition number, $\\kappa_2$, is computed for both matrices $V$ and $L$. The spectral condition number of a matrix $A$ with full column rank is defined as the ratio of its largest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\max}(A)$, to its smallest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\min}(A)$:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(A) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}(A)}{\\sigma_{\\min}(A)}.\n$$\nThis value quantifies the sensitivity of the solution of a linear system or a least-squares problem to perturbations in the input data. A larger condition number indicates greater numerical instability. The singular values are computed using a standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm, which is available in numerical libraries like NumPy.\n\nFinally, for each test case, the ratio $r$ of the two condition numbers is calculated:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\kappa_2(V)}{\\kappa_2(L)}.\n$$\nThis ratio provides a quantitative measure of the improvement in numerical stability gained by using an orthogonal polynomial basis instead of the standard monomial basis for polynomial data fitting. The procedure is repeated for all five test cases, and the resulting ratios are collected. Each ratio is formatted to $6$ significant figures before being included in the final output.

For any real frequency $f$, the discrete-time complex exponential $e^{i 2\\pi f t_n}$ is periodic in $f$ with period $f_s$, so $e^{i 2\\pi f t_n} = e^{i 2\\pi (f + k f_s) t_n}$ for any integer $k$.

A common baseband alias mapping is $f \\mapsto f_{\\text{alias}} \\in [0, f_s/2]$, defined by folding $f$ into the principal interval via the periodicity of the discrete-time frequency. This encapsulates the Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem that continuous-time sinusoids cannot be uniquely reconstructed from uniform samples if $f \\geq f_s/2$.\n- For polynomial interpolation, given distinct nodes $x_0,\\dots,x_{N-1}$ and values $y_0,\\dots,y_{N-1}$, there exists a unique polynomial $p(x)$ of degree at most $N-1$ such that $p(x_n)=y_n$ for all $n$.

The coefficients $c_k$ of $p(t)=\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} c_k t^k$ are found by solving the Vandermonde system $V c = y$, where the matrix $V$ has elements $V_{n,k} = t_n^k$.\n- **Alias Sinusoid Fit**: Coefficients $A$ and $B$ are determined to minimize the sum of squared residuals for the model $y_n \\approx A \\sin(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_n) + B \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_n)$. The resulting fitted sinusoid is $\\tilde{s}_{\\text{alias}}(t) = A \\sin(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t) + B \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t)$.\n- **Dense Grid**: An evaluation grid of $M = 1001$ uniformly spaced points is used, spanning the interval from $t_0$ to $t_{N-1}$.\n- **Metrics**:\n    1.  Max error of alias fit at sample points: $E_1 = \\max_n \\left| y_n - \\tilde{s}_{\\text{alias}}(t_n) \\right|$.\n    2.  Max error of polynomial interpolation at sample points: $E_2 = \\max_n | y_n - p(t_n) |$.\n    3.  Condition number of Vandermonde matrix: $\\kappa(V)$, using the $2$-norm.\n    4.  RMS error between true signal and alias fit on dense grid: $E_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\left( s(t_m) - \\tilde{s}_{\\text{alias}}(t_m) \\right)^2 }$.\n    5.

It is built upon core principles of digital signal processing (the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem, aliasing) and numerical analysis (polynomial interpolation via Vandermonde systems, linear least squares). All concepts are standard and factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. For distinct sample times $t_n$, the Vandermonde matrix $V$ is non-singular, guaranteeing a unique interpolating polynomial exists. The linear least squares problem for the alias sinusoid fit is also well-defined, even in the special edge case (Case 3) where one of the basis functions becomes identically zero over the sample points. The computations are clearly specified and lead to a unique set of metrics.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. All tasks are deterministic computations based on the provided data.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is self-contained, consistent, and computationally feasible. It does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist, such as being non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\nThe solution will be constructed by implementing a computational procedure for each test case, following the principles of digital signal processing and numerical linear algebra.\n\n#### 1. Sampling and Aliasing\nFor each test case with parameters $f_s$, $N$, and $f_{\\text{high}}$, we first establish the discrete representation of the signal.\n- The sample times are generated over the interval $[0, (N-1)/f_s]$ as $t_n = n/f_s$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n- The continuous signal is $s(t) = \\sin(2\\pi f_{\\text{high}} t)$. The samples are computed as $y_n = s(t_n)$.\n- The alias frequency $f_{\\text{alias}}$ must be determined. For a continuous frequency $f$, its discrete-time alias equivalent is periodic with period $f_s$. We find the unique frequency $f' \\in [-f_s/2, f_s/2]$ such that $f \\equiv f' \\pmod{f_s}$. The baseband alias frequency is then $f_{\\text{alias}} = |f'|$. This mapping can be systematically computed as $f_{\\text{alias}} = | \\text{mod}(f_{\\text{high}} + f_s/2, f_s) - f_s/2 |$, where $\\text{mod}$ is the floating-point remainder operation.\n\n#### 2. Polynomial Interpolation using a Vandermonde System\nThe goal is to find the unique polynomial $p(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} c_k t^k$ of degree at most $N-1$ that passes through the $N$ sample points $(t_n, y_n)$. This condition, $p(t_n) = y_n$ for all $n$, generates a system of $N$ linear equations for the $N$ unknown coefficients $c_k$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nt_0^0  t_0^1  \\dots  t_0^{N-1} \\\\\nt_1^0  t_1^1  \\dots  t_1^{N-1} \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\nt_{N-1}^0  t_{N-1}^1  \\dots  t_{N-1}^{N-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_0 \\\\ c_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_{N-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ny_0 \\\\ y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{N-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the Vandermonde system $V c = y$. We will:\n- Construct the Vandermonde matrix $V$ where $V_{n,k} = t_n^k$.\n- Solve the system for the coefficient vector $c$ using a standard linear solver.\n- Compute the $2$-norm condition number $\\kappa(V)$ to assess the numerical stability of the anachronistically ill-conditioned Vandermonde matrix.\n\n#### 3. Alias Sinusoid Fitting via Least Squares\nThe samples $y_n$ are known to be indistinguishable from samples of a sinusoid at frequency $f_{\\text{alias}}$. We model this relationship as $y_n \\approx \\tilde{s}_{\\text{alias}}(t_n) = A \\sin(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_n) + B \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_n)$. We find the coefficients $A$ and $B$ that minimize the sum of squared errors, $\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (y_n - \\tilde{s}_{\\text{alias}}(t_n))^2$. This is a linear least squares problem of the form $M x \\approx y$, where:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sin(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_0)  \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_0) \\\\\n\\sin(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_1)  \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_1) \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots \\\\\n\\sin(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_{N-1})  \\cos(2\\pi f_{\\text{alias}} t_{N-1})\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nx = \\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\ny = \\begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\\\ y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{N-1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe solution $x$ is found by solving the normal equations $(M^T M) x = M^T y$.\n\n#### 4. Error Quantification\nFinally, we compute the five specified metrics to quantify the effects of aliasing and the behavior of the interpolant.\n- $E_1$: Measures how perfectly the samples $y_n$ match a sinusoid at the alias frequency. For true aliasing, these should be identical, so $E_1$ should be near machine precision.\n- $E_2$: Measures the accuracy of the polynomial interpolation at the sample nodes. By definition of interpolation, this error should be near machine precision, serving as a sanity check for the numerical solution of $Vc=y$.\n- $\\kappa(V)$: Characterizes the ill-conditioning of the Vandermonde matrix. This value is typically large, indicating that small errors in $y_n$ could lead to large errors in the coefficients $c_k$.\n- $E_3$: Measures the RMS difference between the true high-frequency signal and its low-frequency alias representation over the continuous interval. A large value indicates that although they match at sample points, they are distinct functions.\n- $E_4$: Measures the RMS difference between the true signal and the interpolating polynomial. This reveals how well the polynomial, which is forced to match the samples, approximates the underlying continuous function between the sample points. In cases of aliasing, this error is expected to be large, as the polynomial will tend to follow the low-frequency alias rather than the true high-frequency signal.\n\nThe procedure will be applied to each of the three test cases, which are designed to probe the phenomena of aliasing ($f_{\\text{high}}  f_s/2$), adequate sampling ($f_{\\text{high}}  f_s/2$), and the critical Nyquist boundary case ($f_{\\text{high}} = f_s/2$).", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef process_case(fs, N, f_high):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the full analysis for a single test case of signal aliasing.\n    \n    Args:\n        fs (float): Sampling frequency in Hertz.\n        N (int): Number of samples.\n        f_high (float): Frequency of the continuous-time signal in Hertz.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A list of five metrics [E1, E2, kappa_V, E3, E4], rounded.\n    \"\"\"\n    M = 1001 # Number of points for the dense grid\n\n    # 1.
