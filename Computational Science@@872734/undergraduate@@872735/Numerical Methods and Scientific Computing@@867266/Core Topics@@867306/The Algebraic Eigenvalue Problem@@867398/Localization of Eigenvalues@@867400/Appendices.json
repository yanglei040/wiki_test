Disjointness of Disk Unions**\n\nLet's define two sets as the union of these disks:\n$\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2$\n$\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4$\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is the union of two disks, $D_1$ and $D_2$. Both disks are centered at $z=5$. Since the radius of $D_2$ ($R_2=0.3$) is smaller than the radius of $D_1$ ($R_1=0.4$), the disk $D_2$ is entirely contained within $D_1$, i.e., $D_2 \\subset D_1$. Therefore, their union is simply the larger disk:\n$\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2 = D_1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 0.4\\}$.\n\nSimilarly, the set $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is the union of two disks, $D_3$ and $D_4$, both centered at $z=-10$. The radius of $D_3$ ($R_3=0.3$) is smaller than the radius of $D_4$ ($R_4=0.35$), so $D_3 \\subset D_4$. Their union is the larger disk:\n$\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4 = D_4 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z + 10| \\le 0.35\\}$.\n\nTo show that $\\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\\mathcal{G}_2$ are disjoint, we compare the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii.\nThe center of $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is $c_1 = 5$. The radius of $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is $R_{\\mathcal{G}_1} = 0.4$.\nThe center of $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is $c_2 = -10$. The radius of $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is $R_{\\mathcal{G}_2} = 0.35$.\n\nThe distance between the centers is $d = |c_1 - c_2| = |5 - (-10)| = |15| = 15$.\nThe sum of the radii is $R_{sum} = R_{\\mathcal{G}_1} + R_{\\mathcal{G}_2} = 0.4 + 0.35 = 0.75$.\n\nSince $d = 15$ is greater than $R_{sum} = 0.75$, the two disks $\\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\\mathcal{G}_2$ are disjoint. Thus, $\\mathcal{G}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{G}_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\n**3. Eigenvalue Count**\n\nAn important extension of the Gershgorin circle theorem states that if the union of $k$ Gershgorin disks forms a connected component that is disjoint from the union of the other $n-k$ disks, then this component contains exactly $k$ eigenvalues of the matrix (counting multiplicities).\n\nIn our case, the set of all four Gershgorin disks, $\\mathcal{G} = D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup D_3 \\cup D_4$, can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: $\\mathcal{G} = \\mathcal{G}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{G}_2$, with $\\mathcal{G}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{G}_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2$ is formed from the union of $k=2$ disks. This set is connected (in fact, it is a single disk).\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4$ is formed from the union of the remaining $n-k = 4-2=2$ disks. This set is also connected.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is a connected component formed by $2$ disks and is disjoint from the rest of the Gershgorin disks, it must contain exactly $2$ eigenvalues of $A$.\nSimilarly, $\\mathcal{G}_2$ must contain the other $2$ eigenvalues.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of eigenvalues in the \"rightmost disjoint set (the one whose disks are centered near $5$)\". This corresponds to the set $\\mathcal{G}_1$, which is centered at $z=5$ on the real axis, while $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is centered at $z=-10$.\n\nTherefore, the number of eigenvalues of $A$ lying in the set $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is exactly $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3249310"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of disjoint regions, we now explore how Gershgorin's theorem interacts with the fundamental properties of real matrices, specifically concerning complex eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the matrix $A$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix.\nThe characteristic polynomial $p(\\lambda)$ is:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{3} - \\lambda  -\\frac{5}{2}  0 \\\\\n\\frac{5}{2}  \\frac{1}{3} - \\lambda  0 \\\\\n0  0  9 - \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nDue to the block-diagonal structure of the matrix, the determinant can be computed as:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (9 - \\lambda) \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{3} - \\lambda  -\\frac{5}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{5}{2}  \\frac{1}{3} - \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (9 - \\lambda) \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\lambda\\right)^2 - \\left(-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (9 - \\lambda) \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\lambda\\right)^2 + \\frac{25}{4} \\right]\n$$\nThe roots of $p(\\lambda)=0$ are the eigenvalues. One root is immediately found from the factor $(9 - \\lambda)$, which gives the real eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 9$. The other two eigenvalues are the roots of the quadratic equation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\lambda\\right)^2 + \\frac{25}{4} = 0\n$$\nLet's expand this to identify the nature of its roots. Let $x = \\lambda$.\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\frac{2}{3}\\lambda + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{25}{4} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\frac{2}{3}\\lambda + \\frac{4 + 225}{36} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\frac{2}{3}\\lambda + \\frac{229}{36} = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ with real coefficients $a=1$, $b=-\\frac{2}{3}$, and $c=\\frac{229}{36}$. The discriminant is $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$.\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 - 4(1)\\left(\\frac{229}{36}\\right) = \\frac{4}{9} - \\frac{229}{9} = -\\frac{225}{9} = -25\n$$\nSince the discriminant $\\Delta$ is negative, the roots of this quadratic equation must be a complex conjugate pair. This is a well-tested fact for polynomials with real coefficients. Therefore, the matrix $A$ has one real eigenvalue and a pair of non-real complex conjugate eigenvalues.\n\nNext, we apply the Gershgorin circle theorem. For a matrix $A = (a_{ij})$, the theorem states that every eigenvalue is located in the union of the Gershgorin disks $D_i$ in the complex plane, where each disk is centered at a diagonal entry $a_{ii}$ and has a radius $R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |a_{ij}|$.\n\nFor the matrix $A$:\nThe first Gershgorin disk, $D_1$, corresponds to the first row:\nCenter: $a_{11} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nRadius: $R_1 = |a_{12}| + |a_{13}| = |-\\frac{5}{2}| + |0| = \\frac{5}{2}$\nSo, $D_1 = \\left\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\,:\\, \\left|z - \\frac{1}{3}\\right| \\le \\frac{5}{2} \\right\\}$.\n\nThe second Gershgorin disk, $D_2$, corresponds to the second row:\nCenter: $a_{22} = \\frac{1}{3}$\nRadius: $R_2 = |a_{21}| + |a_{23}| = |\\frac{5}{2}| + |0| = \\frac{5}{2}$\nSo, $D_2 = \\left\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\,:\\, \\left|z - \\frac{1}{3}\\right| \\le \\frac{5}{2} \\right\\}$. Note that $D_1$ and $D_2$ are identical.\n\nThe third Gershgorin disk, $D_3$, corresponds to the third row:\nCenter: $a_{33} = 9$\nRadius: $R_3 = |a_{31}| + |a_{32}| = |0| + |0| = 0$\nSo, $D_3 = \\left\\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\,:\\, |z - 9| \\le 0 \\right\\}$, which is the single point $\\{9\\}$.\n\nThe union of all Gershgorin disks is $G = D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup D_3 = D_1 \\cup D_3$. To identify the connected components, we check if $D_1$ and $D_3$ intersect. The disk $D_1$ is centered at $\\frac{1}{3}$ with radius $\\frac{5}{2}$. The rightmost point of $D_1$ on the real axis is $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{2+15}{6} = \\frac{17}{6} \\approx 2.833$. The disk $D_3$ is the point $9$. Since $9 > \\frac{17}{6}$, the disks $D_1$ and $D_3$ are disjoint.\n\nThus, the union $G$ has two connected components:\nComponent 1: $C_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2$. Since $D_1=D_2$, this component is just the disk $D_1$. It is formed by the union of two of the original Gershgorin disks.\nComponent 2: $C_2 = D_3$. This component is formed by one of the original disks.\n\nA refinement of the Gershgorin circle theorem states that if a connected component is formed by the union of $k$ Gershgorin disks and is disjoint from the other $n-k$ disks, then it must contain exactly $k$ eigenvalues of the matrix.\nApplying this to our components:\n- $C_1$ is the union of $k=2$ disks ($D_1$ and $D_2$). It is disjoint from $D_3$. Therefore, $C_1$ must contain exactly two eigenvalues.\n- $C_2$ is formed by $k=1$ disk ($D_3$) and is disjoint from $D_1$ and $D_2$. Therefore, $C_2$ must contain exactly one eigenvalue.\n\nThe single eigenvalue in $C_2=D_3=\\{9\\}$ must be the real eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 9$. We established earlier that the matrix $A$ has one real eigenvalue and one pair of non-real complex conjugate eigenvalues. Since non-real eigenvalues of a real matrix must come in pairs, the single eigenvalue in $C_2$ cannot be non-real. Thus, it must be the real eigenvalue $9$. Consequently, the other two eigenvalues, which form the complex conjugate pair, must lie in the other component, $C_1$. This justifies that the disk $D_1$ must contain the two non-real eigenvalues.\n\nFinally, we must determine the radius of the smallest closed disk centered at the common diagonal entry $\\frac{1}{3}$ that is guaranteed by this Gershgorin analysis to contain both nonreal eigenvalues. The analysis concluded that these two eigenvalues are contained in the connected component $C_1=D_1$. The disk $D_1$ is defined by $\\left|z - \\frac{1}{3}\\right| \\le \\frac{5}{2}$. This is a closed disk centered at $\\frac{1}{3}$. Any smaller disk centered at $\\frac{1}{3}$ is not guaranteed by the Gershgorin theorem to contain these eigenvalues. Therefore, the smallest disk guaranteed by the analysis is $D_1$ itself. The radius of this disk is the off-diagonal sum for the first row (or second), which is $R_1 = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe radius, expressed as an exact rational number, is $\\frac{5}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$$", "id": "3249375"}, {"introduction": "While the Gershgorin theorem guarantees a region containing all eigenvalues, the \"tightness\" of this bound can vary dramatically depending on the matrix structure.

Since $t \\ge 0$, we have $|t|=t$.\n- $R_1(t) = |a_{12}(t)| + |a_{13}(t)| = |t| + |t| = 2t$\n- $R_2(t) = |a_{21}(t)| + |a_{23}(t)| = |t| + |t| = 2t$\n- $R_3(t) = |a_{31}(t)| + |a_{32}(t)| = |t| + |t| = 2t$\nThus, all disks have the same radius $R(t) = 2t$.\n\n**2. Computation of $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t)$**\n\nThe minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing $\\mathcal{G}(t) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^3 \\mathcal{D}_i(t)$ is determined by the extremal values of the real and imaginary parts over all disks. For any point $z$ in disk $\\mathcal{D}_i(t)$, we have $\\Re(c_i(t)) - R_i(t) \\le \\Re(z) \\le \\Re(c_i(t)) + R_i(t)$ and $\\Im(c_i(t)) - R_i(t) \\le \\Im(z) \\le \\Im(c_i(t)) + R_i(t)$.\n\nThe real-part bounds for $\\mathcal{G}(t)$ are:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) = \\min_{i} \\left( \\Re\\left(c_i(t)\\right) - R_i(t) \\right) = \\min\\{1-2t, 3-2t, 5-2t\\} = 1 - 2t.\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) = \\max_{i} \\left( \\Re\\left(c_i(t)\\right) + R_i(t) \\right) = \\max\\{1+2t, 3+2t, 5+2t\\} = 5 + 2t.\n$$\nThe imaginary-part bounds for $\\mathcal{G}(t)$ are:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) = \\min_{i} \\left( \\Im\\left(c_i(t)\\right) - R_i(t) \\right) = \\min\\{1-2t, 2-2t, 3-2t\\} = 1 - 2t.\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) = \\max_{i} \\left( \\Im\\left(c_i(t)\\right) + R_i(t) \\right) = \\max\\{1+2t, 2+2t, 3+2t\\} = 3 + 2t.\n$$\nThe area of the bounding rectangle is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) = (U_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t)) \\cdot (U_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t))\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) = ((5 + 2t) - (1 - 2t)) \\cdot ((3 + 2t) - (1 - 2t)) = (4 + 4t)(2 + 4t) = 8 + 24t + 16t^2.\n$$\n\n**3. Computation of $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)$**\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_k(t)\\}_{k=1}^3$ of the matrix $A(t)$ must be computed. Except for trivial cases (like $t=0$), this generally requires a numerical algorithm. For each specified value of $t$, the matrix $A(t)$ is constructed, and its eigenvalues are found using a standard numerical library. Let the computed eigenvalues be $\\lambda_1(t), \\lambda_2(t), \\lambda_3(t)$.\n\nThe bounds of the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing the eigenvalues are:\n- $L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) = \\min_{k} \\Re(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) = \\max_{k} \\Re(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) = \\min_{k} \\Im(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) = \\max_{k} \\Im(\\lambda_k(t))$\n\nThe area of this eigenvalue bounding box is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t) = (U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t)) \\cdot (U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t)).\n$$\n\n**4. Computation of the Localization Tightness Ratio $\\rho(t)$**\n\nThe ratio $\\rho(t)$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t)}{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)} = \\frac{16t^2 + 24t + 8}{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)}.\n$$\nFor $t=0$, $A(0)=D$. The Gershgorin disks are single points (the diagonal entries), and these are also the eigenvalues. Thus, $\\mathcal{G}(0)$ is the set of eigenvalues, which implies $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(0) = \\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(0)$.\n$\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(0) = 8 + 24(0) + 16(0)^2 = 8$.\nThe eigenvalues are $1+\\mathrm{i}, 3+2\\mathrm{i}, 5+3\\mathrm{i}$. The eigenvalue bounding box area is $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(0) = (5-1) \\cdot (3-1) = 8$.\nSo, $\\rho(0) = 8/8 = 1$. For $t0$, the Gershgorin set provides an inclusion region for the eigenvalues, so $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) \\ge \\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)$ and $\\rho(t) \\ge 1$. The value of $\\rho(t)$ quantifies the looseness of the Gershgorin bound as approximated by axis-aligned rectangles.\n\nThe following implementation computes $\\rho(t)$ for each test value of $t$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the localization tightness ratio for a set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 1.5, 3.0]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Define the diagonal matrix D.\n    # D = diag(1+i, 3+2i, 5+3i)\n    D = np.diag([1 + 1j, 3 + 2j, 5 + 3j])\n    \n    # Define the matrix B.\n    # B_ij = 1 for i != j, B_ii = 0.\n    n = 3\n    B = np.ones((n, n)) - np.eye(n)\n\n    for t in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Construct the matrix A(t)\n        A_t = D + t * B\n\n        # Step 2: Compute Area_G(t)\n        # The formula derived is Area_G(t) = (4 + 4t)(2 + 4t)\n        # which simplifies to 16t^2 + 24t + 8.\n        area_G = 16 * t**2 + 24 * t + 8\n\n        # Step 3: Compute Area_E(t)\n        # 3a: Compute eigenvalues of A(t)\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_t)\n        \n        # 3b: Extract real and imaginary parts\n        real_parts = np.real(eigenvalues)\n        imag_parts = np.imag(eigenvalues)\n        \n        # 3c: Calculate the area of the minimal bounding rectangle for eigenvalues\n        if real_parts.size > 0:\n            width_E = np.max(real_parts) - np.min(real_parts)\n            height_E = np.max(imag_parts) - np.min(imag_parts)\n        else: # Should not happen for n=3\n            width_E = 0\n            height_E = 0\n        \n        area_E = width_E * height_E\n        \n        # Step 4: Compute the localization tightness ratio rho(t)\n        # If area_E is zero, it means all eigenvalues are collinear (horizontally or vertically)\n        # or are the same point.
