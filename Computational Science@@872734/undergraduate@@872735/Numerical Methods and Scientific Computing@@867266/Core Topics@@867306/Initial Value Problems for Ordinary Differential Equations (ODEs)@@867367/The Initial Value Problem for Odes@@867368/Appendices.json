Your implementation must start from the foundational definition of the IVP, namely that for a continuously differentiable right-hand side $f(t,y)$, the IVP is specified by $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$ and $y(t_0) = y_0$. Derive the Taylor series method of order $4$ for this ODE by expanding $y(t)$ in a Taylor series about $t_n$ and expressing time derivatives $y^{(k)}(t_n)$ in terms of $t_n$ and $y_n$ using the chain rule applied to $f(t,y) = \\cos(t) + y$. Implement the RK4 method by constructing a $4$-stage approximation based on the fundamental idea of approximating the integral of $f(t,y(t))$ over each step by weighted evaluations at intermediate points. Do not use or assume any shortcut formulas beyond these fundamental bases.\n\nUse the exact analytical solution to evaluate accuracy: solve the linear IVP $y'(t) - y(t) = \\cos(t)$ via integrating factors to obtain $y(t)$, then compute the absolute error at $t = T$ for each numerical method.

It is a well-posed initial value problem (IVP) within the standard framework of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The problem statement is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and provides all necessary parameters, definitions, and constraints for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires solving the IVP defined by the first-order ODE $y'(t) = \\cos(t) + y(t)$ with the initial condition $y(0) = y_0$ on the interval $[0, T]$. This will be accomplished using two distinct numerical methods of order $4$: the Taylor series method and the classical Runge-Kutta method (RK4). The accuracy of these methods will be benchmarked against the exact analytical solution.\n\n### 1. Analytical Solution\n\nThe ODE is a first-order linear differential equation which can be written in the standard form $y'(t) - y(t) = \\cos(t)$. We solve this using an integrating factor, $I(t)$.\n\nThe integrating factor is given by $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int -1 \\, dt\\right) = e^{-t}$. Multiplying the standard form of the ODE by $I(t)$ gives:\n$$e^{-t} y'(t) - e^{-t} y(t) = e^{-t} \\cos(t)$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product $I(t)y(t) = e^{-t}y(t)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^{-t} y(t)\\right) = e^{-t} \\cos(t)$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$e^{-t} y(t) = \\int e^{-t} \\cos(t) \\, dt$$\nTo evaluate the integral on the right-hand side, we use integration by parts twice. Let the integral be $J = \\int e^{-t} \\cos(t) \\, dt$.\nFirst, let $u = \\cos(t)$ and $dv = e^{-t} dt$, so $du = -\\sin(t) dt$ and $v = -e^{-t}$.\n$$J = -\\cos(t)e^{-t} - \\int (-e^{-t})(-\\sin(t)) \\, dt = -e^{-t}\\cos(t) - \\int e^{-t}\\sin(t) \\, dt$$\nFor the remaining integral, let $u = \\sin(t)$ and $dv = e^{-t} dt$, so $du = \\cos(t) dt$ and $v = -e^{-t}$.\n$$\\int e^{-t}\\sin(t) \\, dt = -\\sin(t)e^{-t} - \\int (-e^{-t})(\\cos(t)) \\, dt = -e^{-t}\\sin(t) + J$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $J$:\n$$J = -e^{-t}\\cos(t) - (-e^{-t}\\sin(t) + J)$$\n$$2J = e^{-t}(\\sin(t) - \\cos(t))$$\n$$J = \\frac{1}{2}e^{-t}(\\sin(t) - \\cos(t)) + C_0$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the constant of integration.\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for $y(t)$:\n$$e^{-t} y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}e^{-t}(\\sin(t) - \\cos(t)) + C_0$$\n$$y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(t) - \\cos(t)) + C_0 e^{t}$$\nWe apply the initial condition $y(0) = y_0$ to determine $C_0$:\n$$y_0 = y(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(0) - \\cos(0)) + C_0 e^{0} = \\frac{1}{2}(0 - 1) + C_0 = -\\frac{1}{2} + C_0$$\nThus, $C_0 = y_0 + \\frac{1}{2}$. The exact analytical solution is:\n$$y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(t) - \\cos(t)) + \\left(y_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) e^{t}$$\n\n### 2. Taylor Series Method of Order 4 (T4)\n\nThe Taylor series method is derived by expanding the solution $y(t)$ around a point $t_n$ to approximate the value at $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$:\n$$y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + h y'(t_n) + \\frac{h^2}{2!} y''(t_n) + \\frac{h^3}{3!} y'''(t_n) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} y^{(4)}(t_n) + O(h^5)$$\nA method of order $4$ truncates this series after the $h^4$ term. The numerical update rule is:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h y'(t_n) + \\frac{h^2}{2} y''(t_n) + \\frac{h^3}{6} y'''(t_n) + \\frac{h^4}{24} y^{(4)}(t_n)$$\nWe must express the derivatives of $y$ at $t_n$ in terms of $t_n$ and $y_n = y(t_n)$. Given $y'(t) = f(t,y) = \\cos(t) + y(t)$, we find the higher derivatives by repeated total differentiation with respect to $t$:\n- $y'(t) = \\cos(t) + y(t)$\n- $y''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}y'(t) = -\\sin(t) + y'(t) = -\\sin(t) + \\cos(t) + y(t)$\n- $y'''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}y''(t) = -\\cos(t) - \\sin(t) + y'(t) = -\\cos(t) - \\sin(t) + (\\cos(t) + y(t)) = -\\sin(t) + y(t)$\n- $y^{(4)}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}y'''(t) = -\\cos(t) + y'(t) = -\\cos(t) + (\\cos(t) + y(t)) = y(t)$\n\nSubstituting these into the update rule, with $y_n$ approximating $y(t_n)$:\n$y_{n+1} = y_n + h(\\cos(t_n) + y_n) + \\frac{h^2}{2}(-\\sin(t_n) + \\cos(t_n) + y_n) + \\frac{h^3}{6}(-\\sin(t_n) + y_n) + \\frac{h^4}{24}y_n$\nThe computational cost is defined as the number of evaluations of $f(t,y)$. At each step, we must calculate the derivatives. The expression for $y'(t_n)$ is exactly $f(t_n, y_n)$. The higher derivatives are constructed analytically using $\\sin(t_n)$, $\\cos(t_n)$, and $y_n$, without requiring further \"black-box\" calls to $f$. Thus, the cost per step is $1$ evaluation of $f$. For $N = T/h$ steps, the total cost is $C_{\\mathrm{T4}} = N$.\n\n### 3. Classical Runge-Kutta Method of Order 4 (RK4)\n\nThe RK4 method approximates the integral in the exact relation $y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(\\tau, y(\\tau)) d\\tau$. It does so by using a weighted average of four slope estimates ($k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$) within the interval $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$. This is a multi-stage method.\n\nThe stages for the classical RK4 method are defined as follows:\n1.  An initial slope estimate at the beginning of the interval:\n    $$k_1 = f(t_n, y_n)$$\n2.  A slope estimate at the midpoint of the interval, using $k_1$ to approximate $y$ at that point:\n    $$k_2 = f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, y_n + \\frac{h}{2}k_1\\right)$$\n3.  A refined slope estimate at the midpoint, now using $k_2$ to approximate $y$:\n    $$k_3 = f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, y_n + \\frac{h}{2}k_2\\right)$$\n4.  A slope estimate at the end of the interval, using $k_3$ to approximate $y$:\n    $$k_4 = f(t_n + h, y_n + h k_3)$$\n\nThe final update is a weighted average of these slopes, resembling Simpson's rule for numerical integration:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)$$\nEach step requires calculating $k_1, k_2, k_3,$ and $k_4$, each of which is one evaluation of the function $f(t,y)$. Therefore, the cost per step is $4$ evaluations. Over $N=T/h$ steps, the total cost is $C_{\\mathrm{RK4}} = 4N$.\n\n### 4. Error and Cost Summary\n\n- **Absolute Error**: For each method, the error is the absolute difference between the numerical solution at $t=T$ and the analytical solution: $E = |y_{\\text{numerical}}(T) - y_{\\text{analytical}}(T)|$.\n- **Computational Cost**: For a simulation with $N=T/h$ steps:\n    - $C_{\\mathrm{T4}} = N$\n    - $C_{\\mathrm{RK4}} = 4N$\n\nThe program below will implement these two methods, calculate the results for the specified test suite, and format the output as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the IVP y' = cos(t) + y using Taylor-4 and RK4 methods,\n    and calculates errors and costs for a given test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Problem parameters from the statement\n    T = 1.0\n    y0_values = [0.0, 1.0]\n    h_values = [1.0, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0125]\n\n    # Generate the list of test cases (y0, h)\n    test_cases = [(y0, h) for y0 in y0_values for h in h_values]\n\n    def f(t, y):\n        \"\"\"The right-hand side of the ODE y'(t) = f(t, y).\"\"\"\n        return np.cos(t) + y\n\n    def analytical_solution(t, y0):\n        \"\"\"The exact analytical solution to the IVP.\"\"\"\n        # y(t) = 0.5*(sin(t) - cos(t)) + (y0 + 0.5)*exp(t)\n        return 0.5 * (np.sin(t) - np.cos(t)) + (y0 + 0.5) * np.exp(t)\n\n    def solve_taylor4(y0, T, h):\n        \"\"\"\n        Solves the ODE using the Taylor series method of order 4.\n        The derivatives are specific to y' = cos(t) + y.\n        \"\"\"\n        N = int(round(T / h))\n        t = 0.0\n        y = y0\n        for _ in range(N):\n            # y' = cos(t) + y\n            y_d1 = np.cos(t) + y\n            # y'' = -sin(t) + cos(t) + y\n            y_d2 = -np.sin(t) + np.cos(t) + y\n            # y''' = -sin(t) + y\n            y_d3 = -np.sin(t) + y\n            # y'''' = y\n            y_d4 = y\n            \n            # Update y using the Taylor-4 formula\n            y = y + h * y_d1 + (h**2 / 2.0) * y_d2 + (h**3 / 6.0) * y_d3 + (h**4 / 24.0) * y_d4\n            \n            t += h\n            \n        # Cost is N function evaluations (one evaluation of y' per step).\n        cost = N\n        return y, cost\n\n    def solve_rk4(f, y0, T, h):\n        \"\"\"Solves the ODE using the classical Runge-Kutta method of order 4.\"\"\"\n        N = int(round(T / h))\n        t = 0.0\n        y = y0\n        for _ in range(N):\n            k1 = f(t, y)\n            k2 = f(t + h / 2.0, y + h / 2.0 * k1)\n            k3 = f(t + h / 2.0, y + h / 2.0 * k2)\n            k4 = f(t + h, y + h * k3)\n            \n            y = y + (h / 6.0) * (k1 + 2.0 * k2 + 2.0 * k3 + k4)\n            t += h\n            \n        # Cost is 4 function evaluations per step.\n        cost = 4 * N\n        return y, cost\n\n    results = []\n    for y0, h in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the exact solution at the final time T\n        y_exact_T = analytical_solution(T, y0)\n        \n        # Solve with Taylor-4 method and compute error/cost\n        y_t4, cost_t4 = solve_taylor4(y0, T, h)\n        error_t4 = np.abs(y_t4 - y_exact_T)\n        \n        # Solve with RK4 method and compute error/cost\n        y_rk4, cost_rk4 = solve_rk4(f, y0, T, h)\n        error_rk4 = np.abs(y_rk4 - y_exact_T)\n        \n        results.append([error_t4, error_rk4, cost_t4, cost_rk4])\n\n    # Format the final output string as specified\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join(map(str, results)) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str.replace(\" \", \"\"))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3282721"}, {"introduction": "Initial value problems are powerful tools for modeling the dynamics of complex systems across science and engineering.

We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the long-term outcome of a two-species competition, modeled by the following system of autonomous ODEs:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = x(t) \\left(r_1 - a_{11} x(t) - a_{12} y(t)\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = y(t) \\left(r_2 - a_{21} x(t) - a_{22} y(t)\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhere $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are the population densities of the two species at time $t$. The system is subject to the initial conditions $x(0) = x_0$ and $y(0) = y_0$. This set of equations and initial conditions constitutes the IVP.\n\nFor conciseness and computational implementation, we represent the state of the system using a vector $\\vec{u}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ y(t) \\end{pmatrix}$.

This advanced practice guides you through building a sophisticated solver for a bouncing ball, a classic example of a hybrid system [@problem_id:3282603]. You will combine an adaptive Runge-Kutta integrator with an event-finding algorithm to precisely locate impact times and model the velocity change upon collision, a fundamental skill in simulating mechanical systems, electrical circuits, and other event-driven phenomena.", "problem": "You will design and implement a complete numerical Initial Value Problem (IVP) solver for a one-dimensional bouncing ball with event detection and restart at each impact. The goal is to accurately detect the event time at which the ball hits the ground, enforce a coefficient of restitution at impact, and then restart integration with the post-impact velocity. The scenario is governed by Newtonian mechanics and formulated as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) IVP. You must derive your approach from fundamental principles and then implement it in a correct and robust program.\n\nThe physical setup is as follows. Consider a point-mass ball moving vertically under gravity with linear air drag. Let $y(t)$ be the vertical position and $v(t)$ be the vertical velocity. The governing force balance is Newton’s second law: $m \\,\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}t = \\sum F$, with gravitational force $-m g$ and linear drag force $-b v$. Define the drag-per-unit-mass parameter $\\gamma = b/m$. The continuous-time model is the first-order system\n$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = v,\\quad\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -g - \\gamma v,\n$\nwith initial conditions $y(0)=y_0$ and $v(0)=v_0$. A ground impact event occurs whenever $y(t)=0$ with a downward crossing. At an impact time $t_e$ with pre-impact velocity $v(t_e^-)$, the post-impact velocity is given by the Newtonian restitution law $v(t_e^+) = - r \\, v(t_e^-)$, with coefficient of restitution $r \\in [0,1]$. The position remains continuous $y(t_e^+)=0$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Integrate the system from $t=0$ forward, using a fixed-derivation integrator design rooted in standard explicit Runge–Kutta methods. Use a classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (RK4) as the basic time-marching scheme. Control local truncation error using step doubling: compare one step of size $h$ to two steps of size $h/2$ to obtain an error estimate. Accept or reject steps based on a user-specified absolute tolerance and relative tolerance, and adapt $h$ accordingly to maintain stability and accuracy.\n- Detect ground-impact events by bracketing sign changes of $y(t)$ across accepted steps. When an event is bracketed, refine the event time $t_e$ with a root-finding procedure on $y(t)$ using bisection on time. Each evaluation of $y(t)$ during refinement must be computed by numerically propagating the ODE from the left bracket to the query time using RK4 substeps. The refinement should stop when the time bracket width is below a small absolute threshold and the height magnitude is below a small absolute threshold.\n- Apply the restitution law at $t_e$ by resetting to $y(t_e)=0$ and $v(t_e) = - r \\, v(t_e^-)$, then restart the IVP from this event state, continuing integration. Count the number of impacts. If at some event the post-impact speed is effectively zero, you should stop further integration as no more impacts can occur.\n- Terminate integration when either a specified number of impacts has occurred or a specified maximum time has been reached, whichever comes first.\n\nAll computations must be in coherent SI units: $y$ in meters, $v$ in meters per second, $g$ in meters per second squared, $\\gamma$ in inverse seconds, and time in seconds. Angles are not used. Your program must report the requested output in seconds rounded to six decimals.\n\nYou must propose and use concrete numerical tolerances:\n- Absolute tolerance $\\mathrm{atol} = 10^{-12}$ (in state units).\n- Relative tolerance $\\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-9}$ (dimensionless).\n- Event time refinement tolerance $\\delta t = 10^{-10}$ seconds and event height tolerance $\\delta y = 10^{-12}$ meters.\nThese tunings must be used for all test cases.\n\nTest suite specification. For each test case below, run your solver until the $K$-th impact (if it occurs before the maximum time $T_{\\max}$), and return the time $t_K$ of that $K$-th impact in seconds, rounded to six decimals.\n\n- Test case A (happy path, no drag):\n  - Parameters: $y_0 = 10.0$ m, $v_0 = 0.0$ m/s, $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$, $\\gamma = 0.0$ s$^{-1}$, $r = 0.8$, $K = 3$, $T_{\\max} = 30.0$ s.\n- Test case B (with drag, upward initial velocity):\n  - Parameters: $y_0 = 20.0$ m, $v_0 = 5.0$ m/s, $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$, $\\gamma = 0.1$ s$^{-1}$, $r = 0.9$, $K = 2$, $T_{\\max} = 40.0$ s.\n- Test case C (edge case, start at ground but rising):\n  - Parameters: $y_0 = 0.0$ m, $v_0 = 5.0$ m/s, $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$, $\\gamma = 0.0$ s$^{-1}$, $r = 0.6$, $K = 2$, $T_{\\max} = 20.0$ s.\n- Test case D (edge case, completely inelastic impact):\n  - Parameters: $y_0 = 1.0$ m, $v_0 = 0.0$ m/s, $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$, $\\gamma = 0.0$ s$^{-1}$, $r = 0.0$, $K = 1$, $T_{\\max} = 10.0$ s.\n\nFinal output format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[resultA,resultB,resultC,resultD]\"). Specifically, for the four test cases A, B, C, and D in that order, output $[t_3^{(A)}, t_2^{(B)}, t_2^{(C)}, t_1^{(D)}]$ as seconds rounded to six decimals, with no additional text.", "solution": "We construct the solver from physical principles and numerical analysis fundamentals. The physical base is Newton’s second law $m \\,\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}t = \\sum F$. For vertical motion with gravity and linear drag, the forces are $-m g$ and $- b v$, hence $m \\,\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}t = -m g - b v$. Introducing $\\gamma = b/m$ yields $\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}t = -g - \\gamma v$. The kinematic identity $\\mathrm{d}y/\\mathrm{d}t = v$ closes the first-order system\n$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny \\\\ v\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nv \\\\\n- g - \\gamma v\n\\end{bmatrix},\n$\nwith initial state $\\begin{bmatrix} y(0) \\\\ v(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_0 \\\\ v_0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nAn event occurs when the ground $y=0$ is reached while descending: $y(t_e) = 0$ with $v(t_e^-)  0$. Impact is modeled as instantaneous with position continuity $y(t_e^+) = 0$ and velocity jump $v(t_e^+) = - r \\, v(t_e^-)$. For $r \\in [0,1]$, energy decreases on impact, and for $r=0$ the motion stops at the first impact.\n\nWe must design a solver that integrates the Initial Value Problem (IVP) and detects the event times accurately. We use the explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (RK4), which is a well-tested integrator for smooth right-hand sides:\n$\n\\mathbf{k}_1 = f(t_n,\\mathbf{y}_n),\\;\n\\mathbf{k}_2 = f\\!\\left(t_n+\\tfrac{h}{2}, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\tfrac{h}{2}\\mathbf{k}_1\\right),\\;\n\\mathbf{k}_3 = f\\!\\left(t_n+\\tfrac{h}{2}, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\tfrac{h}{2}\\mathbf{k}_2\\right),\\;\n\\mathbf{k}_4 = f\\!\\left(t_n+h, \\mathbf{y}_n + h \\mathbf{k}_3\\right),\n$\n$\n\\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}_n + \\tfrac{h}{6}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4\\right).\n$\nTo control local error without relying on pre-tabulated embedded pairs, we apply step doubling: compute $\\mathbf{y}^{(1)}$ using one RK4 step of size $h$, and $\\mathbf{y}^{(2)}$ using two RK4 steps of size $h/2$. The difference $\\delta = \\|\\mathbf{y}^{(2)} - \\mathbf{y}^{(1)}\\|_{\\infty}$ estimates the local truncation error. We accept the two-half-step solution if $\\delta \\le \\mathrm{atol} + \\mathrm{rtol}\\,\\|\\mathbf{y}^{(2)}\\|_{\\infty}$; otherwise, we reject and reduce $h$. Upon acceptance, we may modestly increase $h$ to enhance efficiency while remaining within tolerances.\n\nEvent detection is handled as follows. After each accepted step from $(t_n,\\mathbf{y}_n)$ to $(t_{n+1},\\mathbf{y}_{n+1})$, we check the sign of the height component $y$. If $y_n  0$ and $y_{n+1} \\le 0$, an event is bracketed in $[t_n,t_{n+1}]$. We then refine the event time $t_e$ by bisection on time:\n- Maintain a left bracket $(t_L,\\mathbf{y}_L)$ with $y_L0$ and a right bracket $(t_R,\\mathbf{y}_R)$ with $y_R \\le 0$.\n- At each refinement iteration, choose $t_M=(t_L+t_R)/2$ and compute $\\mathbf{y}_M$ by numerically propagating from $(t_L,\\mathbf{y}_L)$ to $t_M$ using RK4 with a fixed small number of substeps to ensure accuracy. If $y_M0$, update the left bracket to $(t_M,\\mathbf{y}_M)$; otherwise, update the right bracket to $(t_M,\\mathbf{y}_M)$.\n- Terminate when $t_R-t_L \\le \\delta t$ and $|y_M| \\le \\delta y$. The refined event time is $t_e \\approx t_R$ with pre-impact state $\\mathbf{y}(t_e^-)\\approx \\mathbf{y}_R$.\nAt the event, we set $y(t_e)=0$ exactly and compute the post-impact velocity $v(t_e^+)=-r\\,v(t_e^-)$. Restart the IVP from $(t_e,[0, v(t_e^+)])$. If the post-impact speed is extremely small, say $|v(t_e^+)| \\le 10^{-12}$, we stop further integration because no future impacts will occur.\n\nCorrectness and consistency checks derive from fundamental solutions in special cases. In the no-drag case $\\gamma=0$, between impacts the motion is ballistic with $\\mathrm{d}^2 y/\\mathrm{d}t^2 = -g$. If $y_00$ and $v_0 \\ge 0$, the first impact time is\n$\nt_1 = \\frac{v_0 + \\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2 g y_0}}{g}.\n$\nLet $v_1^- = -\\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2 g y_0}$ be the pre-impact velocity, so $v_1^+ = r \\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2 g y_0}$. The next flight has symmetric rise and fall, giving an inter-impact time increment $\\Delta t = 2 v_1^+/g$. Further impacts form a geometric sequence in time increments if $\\gamma=0$, with multipliers $r, r^2, \\dots$. Our numerical method must reproduce these values within tolerances. For example, in the special case $y_0=0$ and $v_00$ with $\\gamma=0$, the first impact time is $t_1 = 2 v_0/g$, and the second is $t_2 = t_1 + 2 r v_0/g$.\n\nIn the presence of linear drag $\\gamma0$, the solution between impacts is no longer symmetric, and closed-form inter-impact times are not simple in terms of elementary functions for general initial data. The event-driven numerical method above remains applicable and accurate because the right-hand side is smooth, and the bisection refinement uses the flow map defined by the ODE itself, ensuring consistent root finding for $y(t)=0$.\n\nAlgorithmic design summary:\n- Use RK4 with step doubling for adaptive control with $\\mathrm{atol}=10^{-12}$ and $\\mathrm{rtol}=10^{-9}$.\n- Detect events via sign change of $y$ over accepted steps.\n- Refine event times using time bisection with numerical propagation and tolerances $\\delta t=10^{-10}$ s and $\\delta y=10^{-12}$ m.\n- Apply $v^+ = - r v^-$ at each event, set $y=0$ at the event, and restart.\n- Terminate upon reaching the $K$-th impact or exceeding $T_{\\max}$.\n\nThe final outputs are the event times required by the test suite, in seconds rounded to six decimals, aggregated in the specified order and format. This design directly reflects the Initial Value Problem (IVP) formulation for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), respects physical laws, and ensures numerical robustness through principled error control and root-finding.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef dynamics(t, state, g, gamma):\n    # state = [y, v]\n    y, v = state\n    dy = v\n    dv = -g - gamma * v\n    return np.array([dy, dv], dtype=float)\n\ndef rk4_step(f, t, y, h, args):\n    k1 = f(t, y, *args)\n    k2 = f(t + 0.5*h, y + 0.5*h*k1, *args)\n    k3 = f(t + 0.5*h, y + 0.5*h*k2, *args)\n    k4 = f(t + h, y + h*k3, *args)\n    return y + (h/6.0)*(k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)\n\ndef rk4_step_doubling(f, t, y, h, args):\n    # One full step\n    y1 = rk4_step(f, t, y, h, args)\n    # Two half steps\n    y_half = rk4_step(f, t, y, 0.5*h, args)\n    y2 = rk4_step(f, t + 0.5*h, y_half, 0.5*h, args)\n    # Error estimate\n    err = np.max(np.abs(y2 - y1))\n    return y2, err\n\ndef integrate_segment(f, t0, y0, t1, args, nsub=12):\n    # Propagate from (t0, y0) to t1 using nsub RK4 substeps\n    t = t0\n    y = y0.copy()\n    dt = t1 - t0\n    if dt == 0.0:\n        return y\n    h = dt / float(nsub)\n    for _ in range(nsub):\n        y = rk4_step(f, t, y, h, args)\n        t += h\n    return y\n\ndef refine_event_bisection(f, tL, yL, tR, yR, args, tol_t, tol_y):\n    # Assumes yL[0]  0 and yR[0] = 0\n    left_t = tL\n    left_y = yL.copy()\n    right_t = tR\n    right_y = yR.copy()\n    # Use bisection with numerical propagation from left\n    while (right_t - left_t)  tol_t:\n        mid_t = 0.5*(left_t + right_t)\n        # Propagate from left to mid\n        mid_y = integrate_segment(f, left_t, left_y, mid_t, args, nsub=12)\n        ymid = mid_y[0]\n        if abs(ymid) = tol_y:\n            # Close enough in height;
