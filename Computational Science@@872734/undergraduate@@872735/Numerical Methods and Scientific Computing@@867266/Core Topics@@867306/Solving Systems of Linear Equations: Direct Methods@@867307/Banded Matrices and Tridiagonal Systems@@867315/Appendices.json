By definition, $A$ has nonzero entries only on its main diagonal and its first sub- and super-diagonals, and symmetry implies that the sub-diagonal equals the super-diagonal. Let the main diagonal be specified by $a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n$ and the sub- (and super-) diagonal by $b_1,b_2,\\dots,b_{n-1}$, so that $A_{i,i} = a_i$ and $A_{i,i+1} = A_{i+1,i} = b_i$ for $i = 1,2,\\dots,n-1$. The vector $x$ is the unknown, and $f$ is a given right-hand side.\n\nStarting from the fundamental base of Gaussian elimination for banded systems and the definition of symmetry, derive a specialized elimination and substitution scheme that exploits symmetry to minimize stored quantities and arithmetic operations. Specifically:\n- Begin from Gaussian elimination written in terms of local operations on adjacent rows for tridiagonal matrices and use the symmetry of $A$ to reason about the structure preserved during elimination. Show that the elimination can be organized using a single sequence of multipliers and a single sequence of pivots without needing to store distinct sub- and super-diagonal arrays.\n- Justify, using properties of symmetric matrices and leading principal minors, that the elimination leads to a lower-triangular and diagonal structure that can be used for efficient forward and backward substitution on any single right-hand side $f$ for which the elimination does not encounter a zero pivot.\n- Provide a clear, stepwise algorithm that first performs a forward sweep computing the necessary scalar sequences and an intermediate vector, then a diagonal solve, then a backward sweep, all while using only the main diagonal array $a_i$, one off-diagonal array $b_i$, and the right-hand side $f$.\n- Analyze the storage requirements and operation count of your specialized scheme compared to a generic Thomas algorithm for a non-symmetric tridiagonal system, highlighting precisely what is reduced when symmetry is exploited.\n\nImplement your derived algorithm in a single, runnable program. The program must solve the system $A x = f$ for each of the following test cases, which together probe typical, boundary, and edge behaviors:\n\n- Test case $1$ (symmetric positive definite \"happy path\"): $n = 6$, $a_i = 2$ for $i = 1,\\dots,6$, $b_i = -1$ for $i = 1,\\dots,5$, and $f = [\\,1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1\\,]$ (all entries written in LaTeX as $1$).\n- Test case $2$ (boundary size): $n = 1$, $a_1 = 3$, $b$ is empty, and $f = [\\,6\\,]$.\n- Test case $3$ (symmetric indefinite but nonsingular): $n = 3$, $a = [\\,0.5,\\,-1.2,\\,0.5\\,]$, $b = [\\,1.0,\\,1.0\\,]$, and $f = [\\,1.0,\\,2.0,\\,3.0\\,]$.\n- Test case $4$ (diagonal matrix as a tridiagonal with zero off-diagonal): $n = 3$, $a = [\\,5,\\,7,\\,9\\,]$, $b = [\\,0,\\,0\\,]$, and $f = [\\,10,\\,14,\\,27\\,]$.\n\nAll inputs are dimensionless real numbers. You must express outputs as real numbers. For each test case, the output is the solution vector $x$ as a list of floats.\n\nFinal output format specification:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the solutions for the four test cases as a comma-separated list of lists enclosed in square brackets, with no spaces. For example, if the four solution vectors were $[\\,x_1,x_2\\,]$, $[\\,y_1\\,]$, $[\\,z_1,z_2,z_3\\,]$, and $[\\,w_1,w_2,w_3\\,]$, the format would be exactly $[[x_1,x_2],[y_1],[z_1,z_2,z_3],[w_1,w_2,w_3]]$.", "solution": "We begin from Gaussian elimination on tridiagonal systems. For a general tridiagonal system $A x = f$, the Thomas algorithm performs forward elimination to zero out the sub-diagonal entries step-by-step, producing an upper-triangular system, followed by backward substitution.\n\nThe specialized setting here is that $A$ is symmetric tridiagonal. Symmetry implies $A_{i+1,i} = A_{i,i+1}$, so only one off-diagonal array is needed. Let the main diagonal be $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ and the off-diagonal be $b_1,\\dots,b_{n-1}$. The local elimination at step $i$ (for $i = 2,\\dots,n$) uses the pivot at row $i-1$ to eliminate the sub-diagonal entry at row $i$. In a banded system, elimination affects only adjacent rows due to sparsity.\n\nFundamental base: Gaussian elimination for tridiagonal matrices expresses the elimination of $A_{i,i-1}$ by adding to row $i$ a multiple $\\ell_i$ of row $i-1$, where the multiple is chosen so that the new sub-diagonal entry becomes zero. The value of the multiple is\n$$\n\\ell_i = \\frac{A_{i,i-1}}{\\tilde{A}_{i-1,i-1}},\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{A}$ denotes the running, modified coefficient at that step after previous eliminations. For tridiagonal matrices, after elimination at step $i-1$, the only entries in row $i-1$ that may affect row $i$ are the diagonal $\\tilde{A}_{i-1,i-1}$ and the super-diagonal $\\tilde{A}_{i-1,i}$. By symmetry and bandedness, $\\tilde{A}_{i-1,i}$ equals the off-diagonal $b_{i-1}$ because the structure preserved by adjacent-row elimination does not introduce fill beyond the first super-diagonal.\n\nThus the elimination at step $i$ updates the diagonal of row $i$ via a rank-one correction dependent on $\\ell_i$ and the off-diagonal $b_{i-1}$, and the right-hand side $f$ receives an analogous update for the forward substitution. Concretely, one maintains a sequence of pivots denoted by $d_i = \\tilde{A}_{i,i}$ and multipliers denoted by $\\ell_i = \\tilde{A}_{i,i-1}/d_{i-1}$, with $d_1 = a_1$ and $\\ell_1$ unused. The forward sweep obeys the recurrence\n$$\n\\ell_i = \\frac{b_{i-1}}{d_{i-1}}, \\quad d_i = a_i - \\ell_i\\,b_{i-1}, \\quad y_i = f_i - \\ell_i\\,y_{i-1},\n$$\nfor $i = 2,\\dots,n$, with initialization $y_1 = f_1$. These relations arise directly from Gaussian elimination: subtracting $\\ell_i$ times row $i-1$ from row $i$ eliminates the sub-diagonal, and because the only nonzero in row $i-1$ beyond its diagonal is the super-diagonal $b_{i-1}$, the diagonal of row $i$ is reduced by $\\ell_i b_{i-1}$; the right-hand side at row $i$ is reduced by $\\ell_i y_{i-1}$.\n\nThe structure can be interpreted as an $L D L^{\\mathsf{T}}$ factorization, a well-tested fact for symmetric matrices under elimination without pivot breakdown when all leading principal minors are nonzero. Specifically,\n$$\nA = L D L^{\\mathsf{T}},\n$$\nwhere $L$ is unit lower-triangular with sub-diagonal entries $\\ell_2,\\dots,\\ell_n$ and ones on the diagonal, and $D$ is diagonal with entries $d_1,\\dots,d_n$. This follows from the fact that each elimination step updates only the current row using a multiple of the previous row, preserving symmetry and the tridiagonal structure; the accumulated effect is equivalent to factorizing $A$ into a unit lower-triangular matrix $L$, a diagonal matrix $D$, and the transpose of $L$. The conditions for this factorization to hold without pivoting are that $d_i \\neq 0$ for all $i$, which is equivalent to nonzero leading principal minors.\n\nOnce $A = L D L^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is established, solving $A x = f$ proceeds in three principled steps rooted in the factorization:\n1. Forward substitution to solve $L y = f$. This uses the recurrence\n$$\ny_1 = f_1, \\quad y_i = f_i - \\ell_i y_{i-1} \\quad \\text{for } i = 2,\\dots,n.\n$$\n2. Diagonal solve to obtain $w$ from $D w = y$:\n$$\nw_i = \\frac{y_i}{d_i} \\quad \\text{for } i = 1,\\dots,n.\n$$\n3. Backward substitution to solve $L^{\\mathsf{T}} x = w$. Because $L^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is unit upper-triangular with super-diagonal entries $\\ell_2,\\dots,\\ell_n$, the recurrence is\n$$\nx_n = w_n, \\quad x_i = w_i - \\ell_{i+1} x_{i+1} \\quad \\text{for } i = n-1,n-2,\\dots,1.\n$$\n\nStorage reduction arises because symmetry eliminates the need to carry separate sub- and super-diagonal arrays; only one off-diagonal array is required. The factorization stores one scalar sequence of multipliers $\\ell_i$ and one scalar sequence of pivots $d_i$, totaling $n + (n-1)$ scalars for the matrix factors. In a generic Thomas algorithm for non-symmetric tridiagonal matrices, three diagonal arrays must be carried ($n$ main, $(n-1)$ sub-, $(n-1)$ super-diagonal), and the forward sweep typically computes and uses modified upper diagonal entries as well, leading to more memory traffic.\n\nOperation count analysis:\n- Forward sweep with symmetry and tridiagonality computes, at each step $i = 2,\\dots,n$, one division for $\\ell_i$, one multiplication and one subtraction to update $d_i$, and one multiplication and one subtraction to update $y_i$. This is one division and four floating-point operations per step, totaling $(n-1)$ divisions and $4(n-1)$ basic floating-point operations.\n- Diagonal solve performs $n$ divisions to compute $w_i$.\n- Backward substitution performs, for $i = n-1,\\dots,1$, one multiplication and one subtraction per step, totaling $2(n-1)$ floating-point operations.\n\nIn comparison, a generic Thomas algorithm for a non-symmetric tridiagonal matrix performs a forward sweep that, per step, computes a multiplier (one division), updates the main diagonal (one multiplication and one subtraction), and updates the right-hand side (one multiplication and one subtraction), and must also reference a distinct super-diagonal array. While the count of arithmetic operations per step can be similar in leading order, exploiting symmetry removes the need to store or access a separate super-diagonal array and enables a factorization form that is naturally reusable for multiple right-hand sides without recomputing eliminations, thereby reducing the effective operation count per solve when multiple $f$ are present.\n\nAlgorithm summary suitable for implementation:\n- Inputs: arrays $a$ of length $n$ (main diagonal), $b$ of length $n-1$ (off-diagonal), and $f$ of length $n$.\n- Forward factorization and substitution:\n  - Set $d_1 = a_1$, $y_1 = f_1$.\n  - For $i = 2$ to $n$:\n    - Compute $\\ell_i = b_{i-1} / d_{i-1}$.\n    - Compute $d_i = a_i - \\ell_i b_{i-1}$.\n    - Compute $y_i = f_i - \\ell_i y_{i-1}$.\n- Diagonal solve:\n  - For $i = 1$ to $n$, set $w_i = y_i / d_i$.\n- Backward substitution:\n  - Set $x_n = w_n$.\n  - For $i = n-1$ down to $1$, set $x_i = w_i - \\ell_{i+1} x_{i+1}$.\n- Output $x$.\n\nThe test suite consists of four cases:\n- Case $1$: $n = 6$, $a_i = 2$ for $i = 1,\\dots,6$, $b_i = -1$ for $i = 1,\\dots,5$, $f = [\\,1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1\\,]$.\n- Case $2$: $n = 1$, $a_1 = 3$, $b$ empty, $f = [\\,6\\,]$.\n- Case $3$: $n = 3$, $a = [\\,0.5,\\,-1.2,\\,0.5\\,]$, $b = [\\,1.0,\\,1.0\\,]$, $f = [\\,1.0,\\,2.0,\\,3.0\\,]$.\n- Case $4$: $n = 3$, $a = [\\,5,\\,7,\\,9\\,]$, $b = [\\,0,\\,0\\,]$, $f = [\\,10,\\,14,\\,27\\,]$.\n\nThe program must print a single line containing the four solution vectors in the specified nested-list format without spaces: $[[\\cdot],[\\cdot],[\\cdot],[\\cdot]]$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef symmetric_tridiagonal_ldl_solve(a, b, f):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solve A x = f for symmetric tridiagonal A using LDL^T factorization.\n    A has main diagonal a (length n) and off-diagonal b (length n-1).\n    Returns x as a list of floats.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(a)\n    if len(f) != n:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length of f must equal length of a.\")\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if len(b) not in (0, max(0, n - 1)):\n        raise ValueError(\"Length of b must be 0 or n-1.\")\n\n    # Allocate arrays\n    d = np.empty(n, dtype=float)         # diagonal of D\n    l = np.empty(n, dtype=float)         # subdiagonal of L (l[0] unused/zero)\n    y = np.empty(n, dtype=float)         # intermediate vector for Ly=f\n\n    # Forward factorization and forward substitution\n    d[0] = float(a[0])\n    l[0] = 0.0\n    y[0] = float(f[0])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bi_1 = float(b[i - 1]) if len(b) > 0 else 0.0\n        li = bi_1 / d[i - 1]\n        l[i] = li\n        d[i] = float(a[i]) - li * bi_1\n        y[i] = float(f[i]) - li * y[i - 1]\n\n    # Diagonal solve: D w = y\n    w = y / d\n\n    # Backward substitution: L^T x = w\n    x = np.empty(n, dtype=float)\n    x[n - 1] = w[n - 1]\n    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n        x[i] = w[i] - l[i + 1] * x[i + 1]\n\n    return x.tolist()\n\ndef format_nested_list_no_spaces(list_of_lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Format a list of lists of numbers as a string without spaces, e.g.,\n    [[1.0,2.0],[3.0]] -> '[[1.0,2.0],[3.0]]' but with no spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    def format_list(lst):\n        return \"[\" + \",\".join(f\"{num:.12g}\" if isinstance(num, float) else str(num) for num in lst) + \"]\"\n    return \"[\" + \",\".join(format_list(inner) for inner in list_of_lists) + \"]\"\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case: (a, b, f)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: n=6, a_i=2, b_i=-1, f=ones\n        ([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]),\n        # Case 2: n=1, a=[3], b=[], f=[6]\n        ([3], [], [6]),\n        # Case 3: n=3, symmetric indefinite\n        ([0.5, -1.2, 0.5], [1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]),\n        # Case 4: n=3, diagonal matrix (b zeros)\n        ([5, 7, 9], [0, 0], [10, 14, 27]),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for a, b, f in test_cases:\n        x = symmetric_tridiagonal_ldl_solve(a, b, f)\n        results.append(x)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format: no spaces.\n    print(format_nested_list_no_spaces(results))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3208596"}, {"introduction": "While tridiagonal systems are common, we often encounter matrices that are 'almost' tridiagonal, differing by only a few non-zero entries outside the main three diagonals.

The non-zero elements of $L$ (diagonal $\\alpha_i$) and $U$ (superdiagonal $\\delta_i$) are computed via the following recurrences (using $0$-based indexing for arrays $a, d, c$):\n    $$ \\alpha_0 = d_0 $$\n    $$ \\delta_0 = c_0 / \\alpha_0 $$\n    For $i = 1, \\dots, n-2$:\n    $$ \\alpha_i = d_i - a_{i-1} \\delta_{i-1} $$\n    $$ \\delta_i = c_i / \\alpha_i $$\n    $$ \\alpha_{n-1} = d_{n-1} - a_{n-2} \\delta_{n-2} $$\n\n2.  **Forward Substitution**: The system $T u = LU u = f$ is split into two simpler systems.

This problem is well-defined, scientifically grounded in numerical linear algebra, and all necessary data for the test cases are provided. The assumption that all intermediate block pivots are nonsingular ensures the existence of a unique solution via the proposed block Gaussian elimination method. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe system is defined by $N$ block equations. For $i=1, \\dots, N$, the $i$-th block equation is:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{x}_{i-1} + \\mathbf{D}_i \\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{U}_i \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{f}_i $$\nwhere the blocks are $\\mathbf{L}_i, \\mathbf{D}_i, \\mathbf{U}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ and the vectors are $\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{f}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. By convention, $\\mathbf{L}_1$ and $\\mathbf{U}_N$ are zero matrices of appropriate size. The algorithm to solve this system is a direct generalization of the Thomas algorithm for scalar tridiagonal systems, known as the block Thomas algorithm or block tridiagonal algorithm. It consists of two main phases: a forward elimination sweep and a backward substitution sweep.\n\nThe core principle is to perform a block-wise Gaussian elimination to transform the system into a block upper bidiagonal form, which can then be easily solved by backward substitution.\n\n**1. Forward Elimination Phase**\n\nThe objective of this phase is to transform each block equation into the form:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{U}'_i \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{f}'_i $$\nThis is achieved by deriving recurrence relations for the modified block coefficients $\\mathbf{U}'_i$ and right-hand side vectors $\\mathbf{f}'_i$.\n\nFor the first block row ($i=1$), the equation is:\n$$ \\mathbf{D}_1 \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\mathbf{U}_1 \\mathbf{x}_2 = \\mathbf{f}_1 $$\nAssuming $\\mathbf{D}_1$ is nonsingular (as per the problem statement's guarantee), we can pre-multiply by its inverse, $\\mathbf{D}_1^{-1}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\mathbf{D}_1^{-1} \\mathbf{U}_1 \\mathbf{x}_2 = \\mathbf{D}_1^{-1} \\mathbf{f}_1 $$\nThis gives the initial values for our recurrence:\n$$ \\mathbf{U}'_1 = \\mathbf{D}_1^{-1} \\mathbf{U}_1 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{f}'_1 = \\mathbf{D}_1^{-1} \\mathbf{f}_1 $$\n\nNow, consider the general block row for $i = 2, \\ldots, N-1$:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{x}_{i-1} + \\mathbf{D}_i \\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{U}_i \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{f}_i $$\nWe assume the relation for the previous block, $\\mathbf{x}_{i-1} = \\mathbf{f}'_{i-1} - \\mathbf{U}'_{i-1} \\mathbf{x}_i$, has already been established. Substituting this into the equation for block $i$:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_i (\\mathbf{f}'_{i-1} - \\mathbf{U}'_{i-1} \\mathbf{x}_i) + \\mathbf{D}_i \\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{U}_i \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{f}_i $$\nGrouping terms with $\\mathbf{x}_i$:\n$$ (\\mathbf{D}_i - \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{U}'_{i-1}) \\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{U}_i \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{f}_i - \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{f}'_{i-1} $$\nLet's define the intermediate block pivot as $\\mathbf{D}'_i = \\mathbf{D}_i - \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{U}'_{i-1}$. The problem statement guarantees that $\\mathbf{D}'_i$ is nonsingular. Pre-multiplying by $(\\mathbf{D}'_i)^{-1}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_i + (\\mathbf{D}'_i)^{-1} \\mathbf{U}_i \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = (\\mathbf{D}'_i)^{-1} (\\mathbf{f}_i - \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{f}'_{i-1}) $$\nThis gives the recurrence relations for $i=2, \\ldots, N-1$:\n$$ \\mathbf{U}'_i = (\\mathbf{D}_i - \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{U}'_{i-1})^{-1} \\mathbf{U}_i $$\n$$ \\mathbf{f}'_i = (\\mathbf{D}_i - \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{U}'_{i-1})^{-1} (\\mathbf{f}_i - \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{f}'_{i-1}) $$\nIn implementation, it is numerically preferable to solve linear systems rather than computing matrix inverses explicitly. Thus, we compute $\\mathbf{U}'_i$ by solving $(\\mathbf{D}_i - \\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{U}'_{i-1}) \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U}_i$, and similarly for $\\mathbf{f}'_i$.\n\nFor the last block row ($i=N$), the equation is:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_N \\mathbf{x}_{N-1} + \\mathbf{D}_N \\mathbf{x}_N = \\mathbf{f}_N $$\nSubstituting for $\\mathbf{x}_{N-1}$ using the relation from step $N-1$:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_N (\\mathbf{f}'_{N-1} - \\mathbf{U}'_{N-1} \\mathbf{x}_N) + \\mathbf{D}_N \\mathbf{x}_N = \\mathbf{f}_N $$\nRearranging to solve for $\\mathbf{x}_N$:\n$$ (\\mathbf{D}_N - \\mathbf{L}_N \\mathbf{U}'_{N-1}) \\mathbf{x}_N = \\mathbf{f}_N - \\mathbf{L}_N \\mathbf{f}'_{N-1} $$\nLet the final pivot be $\\mathbf{D}'_N = \\mathbf{D}_N - \\mathbf{L}_N \\mathbf{U}'_{N-1}$. The last unknown block vector $\\mathbf{x}_N$ is found by solving:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_N = (\\mathbf{D}'_N)^{-1} (\\mathbf{f}_N - \\mathbf{L}_N \\mathbf{f}'_{N-1}) $$\n\n**2. Backward Substitution Phase**\n\nWith the last block vector $\\mathbf{x}_N$ computed, we can find the remaining solution vectors by substituting backwards from $i=N-1$ down to $1$. The recurrence relation is taken directly from the transformed system:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_i = \\mathbf{f}'_i - \\mathbf{U}'_i \\mathbf{x}_{i+1} \\quad \\text{for } i = N-1, N-2, \\ldots, 1 $$\nThis process computes all $\\mathbf{x}_i$, completing the solution.\n\n**Special Case: N=1**\nIf there is only one block ($N=1$), the system simplifies to $\\mathbf{D}_1 \\mathbf{x}_1 = \\mathbf{f}_1$. The solution is directly obtained by solving this single $2 \\times 2$ system: $\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\mathbf{D}_1^{-1} \\mathbf{f}_1$.\n\n**Algorithmic Summary**\n\n1.  **If $N=1$**: Solve $\\mathbf{D}_1 \\mathbf{x}_1 = \\mathbf{f}_1$ and return $\\mathbf{x}_1$.\n2.  **Forward Elimination ($i=1$ to $N$)**:\n    a.
