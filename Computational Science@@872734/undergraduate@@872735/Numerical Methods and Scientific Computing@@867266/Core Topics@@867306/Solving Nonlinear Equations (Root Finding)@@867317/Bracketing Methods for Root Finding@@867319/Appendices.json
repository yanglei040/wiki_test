A root of this function corresponds to a break-even point where profit is zero. The company analysts use the bisection method to find this break-even point. They start with an initial interval $[a_0, b_0] = [5, 10]$. After performing three iterations of the bisection method, they obtain a new, smaller interval $[a_3, b_3]$ that contains the root.
