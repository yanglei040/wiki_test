A symmetric stencil is appropriate for approximating an even-order derivative, such as $f''(x)$, at a central point. This is because combining Taylor expansions symmetrically around the point $x$ naturally cancels all odd-order derivative terms, leading to higher accuracy for a given number of points.\n\nLet the approximation be denoted by $D_h^2 f(x)$. Based on the requirement of a symmetric linear combination of the five points, its form must be:\n$$\nD_h^2 f(x) = \\frac{c_2 f(x-2h) + c_1 f(x-h) + c_0 f(x) + c_1 f(x+h) + c_2 f(x+2h)}{d}\n$$\nwhere the coefficients for $f(x \\pm kh)$ are identical due to symmetry, and $d$ is a scaling factor, which we anticipate will be a constant times $h^2$. Our goal is to find coefficients $c_0$, $c_1$, $c_2$ and the denominator $d$ such that $D_h^2 f(x) = f''(x) + O(h^4)$.\n\nWe use Taylor's theorem to expand each function value about the point $x$.

We aim for fourth-order accuracy, which means the error term of the final formula $\\frac{N}{d}$ should be $O(h^4)$. This implies that the leading error term in the numerator $N$ must be of order $h^6$, as the denominator $d$ will be proportional to $h^2$.\n\nThis leads to a system of linear equations for the coefficients:\n1.  Coefficient of $f(x)$ must be zero: $c_0 + 2c_1 + 2c_2 = 0$.\n2.  The coefficient of $f^{(4)}(x)$ must be zero to achieve an accuracy better than $O(h^2)$: $\\frac{c_1}{12} + \\frac{4c_2}{3} = 0$.\n3.  The coefficient of $f''(x)$ must be non-zero. Let $(c_1 + 4c_2)h^2 = K h^2$ for some constant $K$. Then the denominator of our final formula will be $K h^2$.\n\nLet's solve the system. From equation (2):\n$$\n\\frac{c_1}{12} = -\\frac{4c_2}{3} \\implies c_1 = -16c_2\n$$\nTo find minimal integer coefficients, we can choose a simple integer value for one of the coefficients. Let's set $c_2 = -1$.\nThen, $c_1 = -16(-1) = 16$.\nNow, use equation (1) to find $c_0$:\n$c_0 + 2(16) + 2(-1) = 0 \\implies c_0 + 32 - 2 = 0 \\implies c_0 = -30$.\nThe integer coefficients are $c_0 = -30$, $c_1 = 16$, $c_2 = -1$. The greatest common divisor of $|c_0|$, $|c_1|$, $|c_2|$ is $\\text{gcd}(30, 16, 1) = 1$, so these are the minimal integer coefficients for the numerator.\n\nWith these coefficients, let's find the constant $K$. This is the coefficient of $h^2f''(x)$ in the numerator $N$.\n$K h^2 f''(x) = (c_1 + 4c_2)h^2f''(x) = (16 + 4(-1))h^2f''(x) = 12h^2f''(x)$.\nSo, $K=12$. The denominator of our approximation is $12h^2$.\n\nThe resulting approximation is:\n$$\nf''(x) \\approx \\frac{-f(x-2h) + 16f(x-h) - 30f(x) + 16f(x+h) - f(x+2h)}{12h^2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we must verify that the order of accuracy is $O(h^4)$. The first non-zero error term in the numerator $N$ comes from the $f^{(6)}(x)$ term. The coefficient of this term is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{c_1}{360} + \\frac{8c_2}{45}\\right)h^6 = \\left(\\frac{16}{360} - \\frac{8}{45}\\right)h^6 = \\left(\\frac{16}{360} - \\frac{64}{360}\\right)h^6 = -\\frac{48}{360}h^6 = -\\frac{2}{15}h^6\n$$\nSo, the numerator is $N = 12h^2f''(x) - \\frac{2}{15}h^6f^{(6)}(x) + O(h^8)$.\nThe approximation is $\\frac{N}{12h^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{N}{12h^2} = \\frac{12h^2f''(x) - \\frac{2}{15}h^6f^{(6)}(x) + O(h^8)}{12h^2} = f''(x) - \\frac{2}{15 \\cdot 12}h^4f^{(6)}(x) + O(h^6)\n$$\nThe error term is $-\\frac{2}{180}h^4f^{(6)}(x) = -\\frac{1}{90}h^4f^{(6)}(x)$.\nSince the leading error term is proportional to $h^4$, the method is indeed fourth-order accurate.\n\nThe final expression is the fraction constructed from the derived coefficients.\nThe numerator is $-f(x-2h) + 16f(x-h) - 30f(x) + 16f(x+h) - f(x+2h)$.\nThe denominator is $12h^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{-f(x-2h) + 16f(x-h) - 30f(x) + 16f(x+h) - f(x+2h)}{12h^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3281876"}]}
