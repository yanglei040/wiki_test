We shall proceed by systematically addressing each of the posed tasks, adhering strictly to first principles and the provided definitions.\n\nThe linear program is defined over the decision variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ as follows:\nMaximize $z = x_1$\nSubject to:\n$x_1 \\leq 1$\n$x_1 \\geq 0$\n$x_2 \\geq 0$\n\nLet the feasible region be denoted by the set $S$. A point $p = (x_1, x_2)$ is in $S$ if and only if its coordinates satisfy all three constraints simultaneously. Thus, $S = \\{ (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 0 \\le x_1 \\le 1, x_2 \\ge 0 \\}$. This set represents a semi-infinite strip in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane.\n\n**Task 1: Unboundedness of the Feasible Region**\n\nTo prove that the feasible region $S$ is unbounded, we must show, according to the provided definition, that there exists a direction vector along which one can move arbitrarily far while remaining in the set.\n\nLet us choose a point $p_0 \\in S$. A simple choice is $p_0 = (0, 0)$, which clearly satisfies $0 \\le 0 \\le 1$ and $0 \\ge 0$.\nNow, let us define a direction vector $d = (0, 1)^T$. We construct a ray starting from $p_0$ in the direction of $d$. Any point on this ray can be parameterized by $\\lambda \\ge 0$ as:\n$$ p(\\lambda) = p_0 + \\lambda d = (0, 0)^T + \\lambda (0, 1)^T = (0, \\lambda)^T $$\nThe coordinates of any such point are $(x_1, x_2) = (0, \\lambda)$. We must verify if $p(\\lambda)$ remains in the feasible region $S$ for any non-negative value of $\\lambda$. We check the constraints:\n1.  $x_1 \\leq 1$: The condition is $0 \\leq 1$, which is true.\n2.  $x_1 \\geq 0$: The condition is $0 \\geq 0$, which is true.\n3.  $x_2 \\geq 0$: The condition is $\\lambda \\geq 0$, which is true by our definition of the parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nSince all constraints are satisfied for any $\\lambda \\geq 0$, any point on the ray $(0, \\lambda)$ is in the feasible set $S$. As we can choose $\\lambda$ to be arbitrarily large, we can move an arbitrary distance from the origin along the direction $d=(0,1)^T$ and remain within $S$. Therefore, by the given definition, the feasible region $S$ is unbounded.\n\n**Task 2: Optimal Value of the Objective Function**\n\nThe objective is to maximize the function $z = x_1$ for all points $(x_1, x_2)$ in the feasible region $S$. The definition of $S$ includes the constraint $x_1 \\leq 1$. This constraint, by its very nature, imposes an upper bound on the possible values of $x_1$.\n\nThe objective function $z$ is a linear function that depends solely on the variable $x_1$. To maximize $z$, we must find the maximum possible value for $x_1$ that is permitted within the feasible region $S$. The constraints defining $S$ are $0 \\leq x_1 \\leq 1$ and $x_2 \\geq 0$. From the constraint $x_1 \\leq 1$, it is clear that the value of $x_1$ can never exceed $1$.\n\nDoes this maximum value exist within the feasible region? Yes. Consider the point $p^* = (1, 0)$.\n- Is $p^*$ feasible? We check the constraints: $x_1 = 1$ satisfies $0 \\leq 1 \\leq 1$, and $x_2 = 0$ satisfies $0 \\geq 0$. Thus, $p^* \\in S$.\n- At this point, the objective function value is $z = x_1 = 1$.\n\nSince for any point $(x_1, x_2) \\in S$, we have $x_1 \\leq 1$, it follows that the objective function $z = x_1$ is bounded above by $1$. Because we have found a feasible point where this value is achieved, the maximal value of the objective function is precisely $1$.\n\n**Task 3: Explanation of Bounded Objective with Unbounded Region**\n\nThe unboundedness of the feasible region does not translate to the unboundedness of the objective function in this case. The reason lies in the relationship between the gradient of the objective function and the direction(s) of unboundedness of the feasible region.\n\nThe objective function is $z = x_1$. This can be written in vector form as $z = c^T x$, where $x = (x_1, x_2)^T$ and the cost vector (which is the gradient of $z$) is $c = (1, 0)^T$.\n\nIn Task 1, we identified a direction of unboundedness, $d = (0, 1)^T$. This vector indicates that we can move infinitely in the positive $x_2$ direction. For the objective function to be unbounded, its value must increase indefinitely as we move along such a feasible direction. Let's analyze the change in the objective function along this direction $d$.\n\nThe rate of change of the objective function $z$ in the direction $d$ is given by the directional derivative, which for a linear function is simply the dot product $c^T d$. Let us compute this value:\n$$ c^T d = (1, 0) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(0) + (0)(1) = 0 $$\nThe result $c^T d = 0$ shows that moving along the direction of unboundedness $d$ does not change the value of the objective function at all. The direction of unboundedness is orthogonal to the direction of increase of the objective function.\n\nTo illustrate, consider any feasible point $p_0 = (x_{1,0}, x_{2,0}) \\in S$. Let's move from this point along the direction $d$. A new point is $p(\\lambda) = p_0 + \\lambda d = (x_{1,0}, x_{2,0} + \\lambda)$ for $\\lambda \\geq 0$. As long as $0 \\leq x_{1,0} \\leq 1$, this new point remains feasible for all $\\lambda \\geq 0$. The objective value at this new point is:\n$$ z(p(\\lambda)) = c^T p(\\lambda) = c^T(p_0 + \\lambda d) = c^T p_0 + \\lambda(c^T d) $$\nSince we found $c^T d = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ z(p(\\lambda)) = c^T p_0 = x_{1,0} $$\nThis confirms that the objective function value remains constant along any ray parallel to the $x_2$-axis within the feasible set. The unboundedness of the region exists in a direction in which the objective function does not increase. The objective function is bounded because its value depends only on $x_1$, and $x_1$ itself is bounded by the constraints.\n\nIn summary, for a linear program with an unbounded feasible region to have an unbounded objective, there must exist a feasible direction of unboundedness $d$ for which $c^T d > 0$. In this counterexample, no such direction exists; for the only direction of unboundedness, we have $c^T d = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2443959"}, {"introduction": "The standard simplex algorithm requires an initial basic feasible solution, but for many real-world problems, finding one is not trivial.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The constraints, while ultimately found to be contradictory (i.e., the feasible region is empty), are presented in a way that makes the question about the Phase I outcome meaningful. The purpose of Phase I is precisely to detect such infeasibility.

For the first equation, if we set the non-basic variables $x_{1}=0$ and $x_{2}=0$, we get $-s_{1}=20$, or $s_{1}=-20$, which violates the non-negativity of $s_1$. Therefore, following a standard procedure for '$\\geq$' constraints, we introduce an artificial variable $a_{1} \\geq 0$ into the first equation. The slack variable $s_{2}$ from the second equation can serve as a basic variable.\n\nThe system for the Phase I problem is:\n$$5x_{1} + 2x_{2} - s_{1} + a_{1} = 20$$\n$$4x_{1} + 3x_{2} + s_{2} = 5$$\n$$x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1} \\geq 0$$\n\nThe Phase I objective is to minimize the sum of artificial variables. Here, we have only one, so we minimize $w = a_{1}$. If the minimum value of $w$ is greater than zero, the original problem is infeasible.\n\nWe express the objective function $w$ in terms of the non-basic variables. From the first constraint:\n$$a_{1} = 20 - 5x_{1} - 2x_{2} + s_{1}$$\nSo, the objective is to minimize $w = 20 - 5x_{1} - 2x_{2} + s_{1}$. This is equivalent to setting up the objective row in the simplex tableau. The initial basic variables are $a_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. The non-basic variables are $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $s_{1}$.\n\nThe initial simplex tableau for the Phase I minimization problem is constructed as follows. The objective row ($z_{j}-c_{j}$) contains the coefficients of the objective function $w$ expressed in terms of non-basic variables. The objective is $w + 5x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 20$.\nCurrent basic solution: $x_1=0, x_2=0, s_1=0$, gives $a_1=20, s_2=5$.
