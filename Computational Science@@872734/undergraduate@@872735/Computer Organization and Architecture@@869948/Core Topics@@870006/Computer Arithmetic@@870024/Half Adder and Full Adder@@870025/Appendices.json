Using only the axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra (commutativity, associativity, distributivity, idempotence, and absorption), first derive a product-of-sums factorization of $C_{out}$ that uses only OR and AND operations. Then consider two circuit realizations under a uniform delay model in which each elementary AND or OR operation contributes a unit delay of $1$:\n- Realization $\\mathcal{S}$ (sum-of-products with a complex gate): Use one two-input OR to form $S = A + B$, then one two-input AND to form $P = C_{in} \\cdot S$, and finally a single AND-OR (AO) complex gate that computes $Y = (X_1 \\cdot X_2) + Z$ to realize $C_{out} = (A \\cdot B) + P$.

The correct factorization is $C_{out} = (A + B)(A + C_{in})(B + C_{in})$. Realization $\\mathcal{S}$ uses one OR to make $S$, one AND to make $P$, and one AO gate to produce $C_{out}$, but its paths are unbalanced: $A$ or $B$ to $C_{out}$ traverses $2$ internal AO stages, while $C_{in}$ traverses $3$ stages (the external OR and AND plus the AO’s final OR). In contrast, realization $\\mathcal{P}$ gives each input a $2$-stage path (one OR then the final AND), so it is better balanced.\nB. The correct factorization is $C_{out} = (A + C_{in})(B + C_{in})$.

Derivation of the Product-of-Sums (POS) Factorization**\n\nThe starting Boolean expression for the full adder's carry-out is given as:\n$$C_{out} = A B + C_{in}(A + B)$$\nThis is a sum-of-products (SOP) based form. To convert it into a product-of-sums (POS) form using only the axioms of Boolean algebra, we apply the distributive law, specifically $X + YZ = (X+Y)(X+Z)$.\n\nFirst, let's treat $AB$ as a single term and apply the distributive law to the addition with $C_{in}(A+B)$. Let $X = AB$, $Y = C_{in}$, and $Z = A+B$.\n$$C_{out} = X + YZ = (X+Y)(X+Z)$$\nSubstituting back:\n$$C_{out} = (AB + C_{in})(AB + (A+B))$$\nLet's simplify the second term, $(AB + A + B)$, using the absorption law ($U + UV = U$):\n$$AB + A + B = (A + AB) + B = A + B$$\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n$$C_{out} = (AB + C_{in})(A+B)$$\nNow, we apply the distributive law again to the first term, $(AB + C_{in})$. Let $X' = C_{in}$, $Y' = A$, and $Z' = B$.\n$$X' + Y'Z' = (X'+Y')(X'+Z')$$\nSubstituting back:\n$$C_{in} + AB = (C_{in} + A)(C_{in} + B)$$\nBy commutativity, this is $(A+C_{in})(B+C_{in})$.\n\nPutting it all together, the final POS factorization is:\n$$C_{out} = (A+B)(A+C_{in})(B+C_{in})$$\nThis completes the algebraic derivation.\n\n**2. Delay Analysis of Realizations $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$**\n\nThe uniform delay model states that each elementary AND or OR operation contributes a unit delay of $1$.\n\n**Analysis of Realization $\\mathcal{S}$ (SOP with AO gate):**\nThe circuit computes $C_{out} = (A \\cdot B) + P$, where $P = C_{in} \\cdot S$ and $S = A+B$. The final operation uses a complex AND-OR (AO) gate. Let's analyze the signal arrival times, assuming inputs $A$, $B$, and $C_{in}$ are available at time $t=0$.\n\nThe AO gate computes $Y = (X_1 \\cdot X_2) + Z$. For this realization, $X_1=A$, $X_2=B$, and $Z=P$. The delay model for the AO gate is $2$ stages for the $X$ inputs (internal AND, then internal OR) and $1$ stage for the $Z$ input (internal OR).\n\n- **Path 1 (through the AO gate's AND inputs):** The signals $A$ and $B$ enter the AO gate's AND inputs. The delay through this path is $2$ units. Thus, the contribution to $C_{out}$ from this path arrives at $t = 0 + 2 = 2$.\n\n- **Path 2 (through the AO gate's OR input):** The signal $P$ enters the AO gate's OR input. We must first find the arrival time of $P$.\n  - $S = A+B$ is computed by an external OR gate. Its output is ready at $t_S = 1$.\n  - $P = C_{in} \\cdot S$ is computed by an external AND gate. Its output is ready at $t_P = \\max(t_{C_{in}}, t_S) + 1 = \\max(0, 1) + 1 = 2$.\n  - The signal $P$ arrives at the AO gate's $Z$ input at $t=2$. The delay from this input to the output is $1$ unit.\n  - The contribution to $C_{out}$ from this path arrives at $t = t_P + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThe final output $C_{out}$ is stable when all contributing paths have settled. Therefore, the total delay for realization $\\mathcal{S}$ is $\\max(2, 3) = 3$.\nThe signal paths are unbalanced: one path has a delay of $2$ units, while the critical path has a delay of $3$ units.\n\n**Analysis of Realization $\\mathcal{P}$ (POS):**\nThe circuit computes $C_{out} = (A+B)(A+C_{in})(B+C_{in})$ using OR gates feeding a final AND gate. Assuming a single $3$-input AND gate for the final stage, which conforms to the `uniform delay model` of `1` unit.\n\n- **Stage 1 (OR gates):** Three OR operations are performed in parallel.\n  - $T_1 = A+B$: Ready at $t=1$.\n  - $T_2 = A+C_{in}$: Ready at $t=1$.\n  - $T_3 = B+C_{in}$: Ready at $t=1$.\n\n- **Stage 2 (Final AND gate):** A single AND gate takes $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ as inputs. Since all three inputs arrive at $t=1$, the final output is ready at $t = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nIn this realization, every path from any input ($A$, $B$, or $C_{in}$) to the output $C_{out}$ consists of one OR gate followed by one AND gate. The total delay for every path is $1+1=2$ units. The paths are perfectly balanced, and the critical path delay is $2$.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:** Realization $\\mathcal{P}$ is both faster (delay of $2$ vs $3$) and perfectly path-balanced, whereas realization $\\mathcal{S}$ is slower and path-unbalanced.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The correct factorization is $C_{out} = (A + B)(A + C_{in})(B + C_{in})$. Realization $\\mathcal{S}$ uses one OR to make $S$, one AND to make $P$, and one AO gate to produce $C_{out}$, but its paths are unbalanced: $A$ or $B$ to $C_{out}$ traverses $2$ internal AO stages, while $C_{in}$ traverses $3$ stages (the external OR and AND plus the AO’s final OR). In contrast, realization $\\mathcal{P}$ gives each input a $2$-stage path (one OR then the final AND), so it is better balanced.**\n- The factorization is correct as derived above.\n- The description of realization $\\mathcal{P}$ having balanced $2$-stage paths is correct.\n- The conclusion that realization $\\mathcal{S}$ has unbalanced paths is correct.\n- The reasoning for the path lengths in $\\mathcal{S}$ is slightly ambiguous but captures the essence of the timing. The critical path involves $C_{in}$ and has a total delay equivalent to $3$ gate stages ($A+B$ $\\to$ $(A+B)C_{in}$ $\\to$ final OR), which is correctly identified. The faster path for $A$ and $B$ (through the internal AO-AND) has a delay of $2$ stages. The statement correctly concludes that $\\mathcal{S}$ is unbalanced and $\\mathcal{P}$ is better balanced.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The correct factorization is $C_{out} = (A + C_{in})(B + C_{in})$. Both realizations $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$ have balanced $2$-stage paths from all inputs to $C_{out}$ under the stated delay model.**\n- The factorization is incorrect. It simplifies to $AB+C_{in}$, which is not equivalent to the full adder carry-out. For example, if $A=0$, $B=0$, $C_{in}=1$, then $C_{out}=0$ but $AB+C_{in}=1$.\n- The claim that $\\mathcal{S}$ has balanced $2$-stage paths is incorrect.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The correct factorization is $C_{out} = (A \\cdot B) + (A \\oplus B) C_{in}$, and realization $\\mathcal{S}$ is path-balanced because every input passes through exactly $2$ stages before reaching $C_{out}$.**\n- The expression $C_{out} = AB + (A \\oplus B) C_{in}$ is a valid representation for the carry-out. However, the problem explicitly asks for a POS factorization \"using only OR and AND operations\". This form uses XOR ($\\oplus$) and is an SOP form, so it does not meet the problem's derivation requirement.\n- The claim that realization $\\mathcal{S}$ is path-balanced is incorrect, as shown in the analysis. Its critical path delay is $3$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The correct factorization is $C_{out} = (A + B)(A + C_{in})(B + C_{in})$, but realization $\\mathcal{P}$ yields a longer $3$-stage path for $C_{in}$ than for $A$ or $B$, so $\\mathcal{S}$ is better balanced than $\\mathcal{P}$.**\n- The factorization is correct.\n- The claim that realization $\\mathcal{P}$ has a $3$-stage path for $C_{in}$ is incorrect. As analyzed, all inputs in $\\mathcal{P}$ have a $2$-stage path.\n- The conclusion that $\\mathcal{S}$ is better balanced than $\\mathcal{P}$ is incorrect. The reverse is true.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3645089"}]}
