It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Boolean algebra and digital logic design, which are core topics in computer organization and architecture. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present.\n\nThe objective is to find the minimal number of explicit inverter gates required to implement the given Boolean function $F(A,B,C)$ using a specific component library. The primary inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$ are only available in their uncomplemented forms. The function is specified as:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{\\left(A \\lor \\overline{\\left(B \\lor C\\right)}\\right)}$$\n\nTo minimize the number of inverters, we must simplify this expression using the axioms of Boolean algebra. The structure of the expression, having a complement over a disjunction, suggests the application of De Morgan's laws. De Morgan's first law states that for any two Boolean variables $X$ and $Y$:\n$$\\overline{X \\lor Y} = \\overline{X} \\land \\overline{Y}$$\n\nWe apply this law to the given expression for $F$, by setting $X=A$ and $Y=\\overline{(B \\lor C)}$. This substitution yields:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A} \\land \\overline{\\left(\\overline{(B \\lor C)}\\right)}$$\n\nNext, we apply the law of double complementation (or involution), which states that for any Boolean variable $Z$:\n$$\\overline{\\overline{Z}} = Z$$\n\nIn our expression, we can set $Z = B \\lor C$. Applying the law of double complementation simplifies the term $\\overline{\\left(\\overline{(B \\lor C)}\\right)}$ to $(B \\lor C)$. Substituting this back into the expression for $F$, we obtain the simplified form:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A} \\land (B \\lor C)$$\n\nNow, we analyze the implementation of this simplified expression using the available gate library, which consists of two-input $\\land$ gates, two-input $\\lor$ gates, and single-input inverter gates. The inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$ are available in uncomplemented form.\n\nThe implementation of $F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A} \\land (B \\lor C)$ can be broken down into three steps:\n$1$. Compute the term $(B \\lor C)$. This can be done using one two-input $\\lor$ gate with inputs $B$ and $C$. Since $B$ and $C$ are primary inputs, no inverters are needed for this step.\n$2$. Compute the term $\\overline{A}$. Since the primary input $A$ is only available in its uncomplemented form, we must use one single-input inverter gate to generate its complement, $\\overline{A}$.\n$3$. Compute the final expression $\\overline{A} \\land (B \\lor C)$. This can be done using one two-input $\\land$ gate, with inputs being the outputs of the previous two steps, namely $\\overline{A}$ and $(B \\lor C)$.\n\nBased on this gate-level realization, the total number of explicit inverter gates required is exactly one, used to generate $\\overline{A}$.\n\nTo confirm this is the minimal number, we must prove that an implementation with zero inverters is impossible. A Boolean function can be implemented without any inverters if and only if it is a *monotone* function. A function is monotone if it is non-decreasing with respect to all of its variables. That is, for any variable $X_i$, holding all other variables constant, changing $X_i$ from $0$ to $1$ cannot cause the function's output to change from $1$ to $0$. Formally, $f(x_1, \\dots, 0, \\dots, x_n) \\leq f(x_1, \\dots, 1, \\dots, x_n)$.\n\nLet's test if $F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A} \\land (B \\lor C)$ is monotone with respect to the variable $A$. We can choose arbitrary values for $B$ and $C$, for instance $B=1$ and $C=0$.\n- For $A=0$: $F(0,1,0) = \\overline{0} \\land (1 \\lor 0) = 1 \\land 1 = 1$.\n- For $A=1$: $F(1,1,0) = \\overline{1} \\land (1 \\lor 0) = 0 \\land 1 = 0$.\n\nSince $F(0,1,0) = 1$ and $F(1,1,0) = 0$, we have $F(0,1,0) > F(1,1,0)$. This demonstrates that the function is not monotone with respect to the variable $A$. Because the function is not monotone, it cannot be constructed using only $\\land$ and $\\lor$ gates from the uncomplemented inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$. Therefore, an implementation with zero inverters is not possible.\n\nThe minimal number of inverters must be greater than zero. We have found an implementation that uses exactly one inverter. Thus, the minimal number of explicit inverter gates required to implement the function $F$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3633536"}, {"introduction": "Abstract Boolean functions must ultimately be mapped to physical gates, and De Morgan's laws provide the essential bridge between logic and implementation.

The goal is to find the minimal number of gates required.\n\nFirst, we state the fundamental definitions based on the primitive operations of conjunction ($\\land$), disjunction ($\\lor$), and complement ($\\overline{(\\cdot)}$). The $2$-input NAND and NOR operations are defined as:\n$$X \\text{ NAND } Y = \\overline{X \\land Y}$$\n$$X \\text{ NOR } Y = \\overline{X \\lor Y}$$\n\nThe problem also permits the creation of an inverter (NOT gate) by tying the inputs of a $2$-input NAND or NOR gate together.

This is an And-Or-Invert (AOI) structure. We seek an algebraic form that maps directly to the allowed gate types for a minimal implementation.\n\nWe start by applying one of De Morgan's laws, which are fundamental theorems in Boolean algebra. Specifically, the theorem states that $\\overline{X \\lor Y} = \\overline{X} \\land \\overline{Y}$. Let $X = (A \\land B)$ and $Y = (C \\land D)$. Applying this theorem to the expression for $F$ yields:\n$$F = \\overline{(A \\land B)} \\land \\overline{(C \\land D)}$$\nThis expression is a logical conjunction (AND) of two terms. Each term is of the form $\\overline{P \\land Q}$, which is the definition of the NAND operation.\nLet us define two intermediate signals:\n$$G_1 = \\overline{A \\land B} = A \\text{ NAND } B$$\n$$G_2 = \\overline{C \\land D} = C \\text{ NAND } D$$\nEach of these signals can be generated with a single $2$-input NAND gate. Substituting these into the expression for $F$:\n$$F = G_1 \\land G_2$$\nThe final operation is a logical AND. A $2$-input AND operation can be realized using the available gates by applying double negation, $\\overline{\\overline{Z}} = Z$, and the definition of the NAND gate:\n$$G_1 \\land G_2 = \\overline{\\overline{G_1 \\land G_2}} = \\overline{G_1 \\text{ NAND } G_2}$$\nThis shows that the AND operation can be implemented with a NAND gate followed by an inverter.\n\nBased on this derivation, we can construct the circuit for $F$:\n1.  A $2$-input NAND gate computes $G_1 = A \\text{ NAND } B$. This is $1$ gate.\n2.  A $2$-input NAND gate computes $G_2 = C \\text{ NAND } D$. This is $1$ gate.\n3.  A third $2$-input NAND gate computes $G_3 = G_1 \\text{ NAND } G_2 = \\overline{G_1 \\land G_2}$. This is $1$ gate.\n4.  A fourth gate is used as an inverter to compute $F = \\overline{G_3} = \\overline{\\overline{G_1 \\land G_2}} = G_1 \\land G_2$. This can be a $2$-input NAND gate with its inputs tied to $G_3$, i.e., $F = G_3 \\text{ NAND } G_3 = \\overline{G_3}$. This is $1$ gate.\n\nThe total number of gates in this implementation is $1+1+1+1 = 4$. All gates used are $2$-input NAND gates, which are permitted. Thus, an implementation with $4$ gates is possible.\n\nNext, we must justify why this is the minimal number of gates.\nThe function $F$ depends on all four input variables $A, B, C, D$. For example, setting $B=1, C=0, D=0$ results in $F = \\overline{(A \\land 1) \\lor (0 \\land 0)} = \\overline{A}$, which clearly depends on $A$. By the symmetry of the expression, $F$ depends on all four variables.\n- A single $2$-input gate can only depend on at most two variables. Thus, $1$ gate is insufficient.\n- A circuit of two $2$-input gates can depend on at most three variables (e.g., $G_2(G_1(A,B),C)$). Thus, $2$ gates are insufficient.\n- Therefore, at least $3$ gates are required to implement any function of $4$ variables.\n\nWe must now show that $3$ gates are also insufficient. The most general $3$-gate structures for a $4$-variable function are either a two-level tree, e.g., $H(G_1(A,B), G_2(C,D))$, or a cascaded chain, e.g., $H(G_2(G_1(A,B),C),D)$. The cascaded chain structure is inherently asymmetric with respect to its inputs. The function $F$ possesses a symmetry where swapping the pair $(A,B)$ with the pair $(C,D)$ leaves the function unchanged. A cascaded chain cannot realize such a symmetric function. Therefore, we only need to analyze the two-level tree structure.\nLet the gates be from the allowed set {NAND, NOR}. We examine all possibilities for the gate types in the structure $H(G_1(A,B), G_2(C,D))$:\n\n1.  $G_1, G_2, H$ are all NAND gates: The output is $(A \\text{ NAND } B) \\text{ NAND } (C \\text{ NAND } D) = \\overline{(\\overline{A \\land B}) \\land (\\overline{C \\land D})} = (A \\land B) \\lor (C \\land D)$. This function is the complement of $F$, i.e., $\\overline{F}$. It is not $F$.\n2.  $G_1, G_2, H$ are all NOR gates: The output is $(A \\text{ NOR } B) \\text{ NOR } (C \\text{ NOR } D) = \\overline{(\\overline{A \\lor B}) \\lor (\\overline{C \\lor D})} = (A \\lor B) \\land (C \\lor D)$.

This is not $F$.\n\nSince none of the possible $3$-gate configurations in a two-level tree structure can realize the function $F$, and we have argued against other $3$-gate structures on the basis of symmetry, no implementation with $3$ gates is possible.\n\nWe have established that the number of gates must be greater than $3$, and we have demonstrated a valid implementation using $4$ gates.
