All provided parameters and conditions are scientifically and mathematically sound. The problem is well-posed and concerns standard concepts in computational structural dynamics, specifically the interaction of the Newmark-$\\beta$ time integration scheme with signal sampling theory. No inconsistencies or flaws are found. The problem is valid.\n\nThe central issue of this problem is aliasing. Aliasing occurs when a continuous-time signal is sampled at a frequency $f_s$ that is insufficient to capture its highest frequency components. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, a signal with maximum frequency $f_{\\max}$ must be sampled at a rate $f_s  2 f_{\\max}$ to avoid aliasing. The frequency $f_N = f_s / 2$ is known as the Nyquist frequency. If a sinusoidal component with frequency $f  f_N$ is sampled, it becomes indistinguishable from a lower-frequency sinusoid, its alias, with frequency $f_a$ in the range $[0, f_N]$. The alias frequency is given by $f_a = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |f - k f_s|$.\n\nIn the initial setup, the forcing frequency is $f=63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The time step is $\\Delta t = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$, which corresponds to a sampling frequency of $f_s = 1/\\Delta t = 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The Nyquist frequency is therefore $f_N = f_s/2 = 50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nSince $f = 63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}  f_N = 50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the input signal is undersampled, and aliasing will occur. The numerical integrator operates on the discrete samples of the forcing function $p(t)$, which are $p_i = p(i\\Delta t)$. The sequence $\\{p_i\\}$ will therefore represent an aliased signal. The aliased frequency is calculated as:\n$$ f_a = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |f - k f_s| = |63\\,\\mathrm{Hz} - 1 \\cdot 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}| = |-37\\,\\mathrm{Hz}| = 37\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\nThe numerical algorithm thus solves the equation of motion for a system subjected to a sinusoidal forcing at $37\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, not $63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The system is linear, so the steady-state response will also be at this aliased frequency.\n\nThe specified Newmark–$\\beta$ method parameters are $\\beta=1/4$ and $\\gamma=1/2$. This corresponds to the constant average acceleration method, which is known to be unconditionally stable for linear systems. However, stability only ensures that the numerical solution remains bounded; it does not prevent inaccuracies such as period elongation, amplitude decay, or the effects of input aliasing.\n\nWe now evaluate each statement.\n\nA. Under sampling at $f_s=100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the sinusoidal input at $f=63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is indistinguishable from a sinusoid at $f_a=|f-f_s|=37\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$; therefore, the computed displacement will exhibit a component at approximately $37\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ rather than at $63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nAs derived above, the sampling process aliases the $f=63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ input frequency to $f_a = 37\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The numerical integrator is fed the discrete values of the load, $p_i = P_0 \\sin(2\\pi f i \\Delta t)$. This sequence of values is mathematically identical to the sampled values of a sinusoid with frequency $f_a$ (with a possible phase shift, in this case $-\\sin(2\\pi f_a i \\Delta t)$). The linear system will respond at the frequency of its excitation. Therefore, the numerically computed steady-state displacement will oscillate at a frequency very close to the aliased frequency of $37\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The word \"approximately\" correctly accounts for minor numerical period errors inherent to the integration scheme, which, while zero for this specific method in the undamped case, can be present in damped systems. The core of the statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Because the Newmark–$\\beta$ method with $\\beta=1/4$, $\\gamma=1/2$ is unconditionally stable, aliasing cannot occur; with the given data the steady-state displacement due to the $63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ input is identically zero (apart from transients).\nThis statement is incorrect on two fundamental points. First, unconditional stability of a numerical method has no bearing on whether aliasing of the input signal occurs. Aliasing is a consequence of sampling a continuous signal below the Nyquist rate. It is a signal processing phenomenon that precedes the numerical integration step. Second, the effective input to the numerical scheme is a sinusoid at $37\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. A linear damped oscillator subjected to a sinusoidal force will exhibit a non-zero steady-state sinusoidal response. The displacement is certainly not identically zero.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. If the time step is reduced to $\\Delta t=0.002\\,\\mathrm{s}$ (so $f_s=500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $f_N=250\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$), aliasing of the $63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ input would be eliminated.\nWith the new time step $\\Delta t = 0.002\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the sampling frequency becomes $f_s = 1/\\Delta t = 500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The Nyquist frequency is $f_N = f_s/2 = 250\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The input frequency is $f = 63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Since $f  f_N$ (or, equivalently, $f_s  2f$), the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion is satisfied. The sampling process will correctly capture the $63\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ sinusoid without aliasing.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Increasing the damping ratio to $\\zeta=0.20$ while keeping $\\Delta t=0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$ would remove aliasing by suppressing all content above $f_N$ so that no aliased component appears in the discrete-time solution.\nThis statement fundamentally misinterprets the cause of aliasing. Aliasing is determined by the properties of the *input signal* $p(t)$ and the *sampling process* ($\\Delta t$), not by the physical properties of the system being modeled (such as the damping coefficient $c$). The numerical method solves for the response to the discrete force sequence $\\{p_i\\}$, and this sequence is already aliased regardless of the value of $\\zeta$. Increasing damping will reduce the amplitude of the computed response to the aliased $37\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ input, but it will not \"remove aliasing\" itself. The phenomenon of aliasing has already occurred at the input stage.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. If $\\Delta t$ were chosen so that the aliased frequency of a high-frequency input fell near $f_n$, the Newmark solution could show a large near-resonant amplitude even though the true continuous-time excitation is far from resonance.\nThis describes a dangerous consequence of aliasing in numerical simulation. The natural frequency of the system is $f_n = 5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Let us consider a high-frequency input, for instance $f_{true} = 105\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is far from resonance. If we choose a sampling frequency $f_s = 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ (i.e., $\\Delta t = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$), the aliased frequency will be $f_a = |f_{true} - f_s| = |105\\,\\mathrm{Hz} - 100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}| = 5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The numerical integrator will then be solving for the response of the system to an excitation at its natural frequency, $f_n = 5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Given the low damping ($\\zeta=0.02$), this will produce a very large, resonant response in the numerical solution. This numerical result would be completely spurious, as the true system response to a $105\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ forcing would be small in amplitude. The statement correctly identifies this possibility.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2446581"}, {"introduction": "Choosing the right numerical integrator is paramount, especially for systems with a wide range of natural frequencies, known as 'stiff' systems.

The specific parameters given, $\\beta = \\tfrac{1}{4}$ and $\\gamma = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, define the \"average acceleration method,\" which is unconditionally stable for linear systems and has second-order accuracy.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds from a known state $(\\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{v}_n, \\mathbf{a}_n)$ at time $t_n$ to the state at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$.\n1.  **Initialization**: Given $\\mathbf{x}_0$ and $\\mathbf{v}_0$, compute the initial acceleration $\\mathbf{a}_0$ by solving the equation of motion at $t=0$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{a}_0 + \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{v}_0 + \\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\mathbf{a}_0 = -\\mathbf{M}^{-1}(\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{v}_0 + \\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}_0)\n    $$\n2.  **Time-stepping loop**: For each step $n=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$:\n    a.  **Predictor step**: Calculate predictor values for displacement and velocity.\n        $$\n        \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{x}_n + \\Delta t \\mathbf{v}_n + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\beta\\right)\\Delta t^2 \\mathbf{a}_n\n        $$\n        $$\n        \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{v}_n + (1-\\gamma)\\Delta t \\mathbf{a}_n\n        $$\n    b.  **Solve for acceleration**: The acceleration at the new time step, $\\mathbf{a}_{n+1}$, is found by solving the linear system derived from substituting the Newmark relations into the equation of motion at $t_{n+1}$:\n        $$\n        \\left( \\mathbf{M} + \\gamma \\Delta t \\mathbf{C} + \\beta \\Delta t^2 \\mathbf{K} \\right) \\mathbf{a}_{n+1} = -\\left( \\mathbf{C}\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_{n+1} + \\mathbf{K}\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{n+1} \\right)\n        $$\n        The matrix on the left, an effective mass matrix, is constant for a fixed time step $\\Delta t$ and can be factorized once.\n    c.  **Corrector step**: Update the displacement and velocity using the computed $\\mathbf{a}_{n+1}$:\n        $$\n        \\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{n+1} + \\beta \\Delta t^2 \\mathbf{a}_{n+1}\n        $$\n        $$\n        \\mathbf{v}_{n+1} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_{n+1} + \\gamma \\Delta t \\mathbf{a}_{n+1}\n        $$\nThe process is repeated until the final time $T$ is reached. The final numerical displacement is $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) = \\mathbf{x}_N$.\n\n**4. Numerical Method 2: Classical Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) Method**\n\nThe RK4 method is an explicit scheme applied to the first-order state-space system $\\dot{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{y}$. From state $\\mathbf{y}_n$ at time $t_n$, the state $\\mathbf{y}_{n+1}$ is computed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6} (\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4)\n$$\nwhere the four stages $\\mathbf{k}_i$ are calculated as:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{k}_1 = \\mathbf{A}\\,\\mathbf{y}_n \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_2 = \\mathbf{A}\\left(\\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\mathbf{k}_1\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_3 = \\mathbf{A}\\left(\\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\mathbf{k}_2\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_4 = \\mathbf{A}\\left(\\mathbf{y}_n + \\Delta t\\mathbf{k}_3\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis process is repeated for $N = T/\\Delta t$ steps. The final numerical displacement $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{num}}(T)$ is the first two components of $\\mathbf{y}_N$.\n\nRK4 is conditionally stable. Its stability is governed by the product of the time step $\\Delta t$ and the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. For stiff systems, where the eigenvalues have large-magnitude imaginary parts (corresponding to high frequencies $\\omega$), stability requires a very small $\\Delta t$. This behavior will be tested, particularly in Test cases $1$ and $2$.\n\n**5. Error and Stability Assessment**\n\nFor each method and test case, the displacement error is calculated as the Euclidean norm of the difference between the numerical and exact solutions at the final time $T$:\n$$\ne = \\left\\|\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T)\\right\\|_2\n$$\nThe stability of the RK4 method is evaluated using the provided criterion. The simulation is deemed \"stable\" if the maximum norm of the state vector over all time steps does not grow excessively relative to the initial norm:\n$$\n\\max_{0\\le n \\le N} \\left\\|\\mathbf{y}_n\\right\\|_2 \\le 10^6\\,\\left\\|\\mathbf{y}_0\\right\\|_2\n$$\nThis condition is checked by monitoring $\\|\\mathbf{y}_n\\|_2$ at each step of the RK4 integration.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Construct matrices $\\mathbf{M}$, $\\mathbf{C}$, $\\mathbf{K}$, and $\\mathbf{A}$ from the given parameters.\n2.  Set initial conditions $\\mathbf{x}_0$, $\\mathbf{v}_0$, and form $\\mathbf{y}_0$.\n3.  Compute $\\mathbf{y}_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T) = \\exp(\\mathbf{A}\\,T)\\,\\mathbf{y}_0$ and extract $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T)$.\n4.  Execute the Newmark-$\\beta$ integration from $t=0$ to $t=T$ to find $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{Newmark}}(T)$.\n5.  Execute the RK4 integration from $t=0$ to $t=T$ to find $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{RK4}}(T)$, while tracking the maximum state norm for the stability check.\n6.  Compute the errors $e_{\\mathrm{Newmark}}$ and $e_{\\mathrm{RK4}}$ and determine the RK4 stability boolean $b$.\n7.
