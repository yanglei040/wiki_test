{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before building a complex computational model, we must first ensure its mathematical foundation is sound. This practice explores the fundamental concept of well-posedness, which dictates whether a problem has a unique and stable solution. For a second-order elliptic equation, such as the one governing steady-state heat flow, the number and type of boundary conditions are critical; too few can lead to an infinite number of solutions, while too many can create a contradiction with no solution at all. By attempting to solve the same equation with under-specified, well-posed, and over-specified conditions, you will gain an intuitive and practical understanding of why a problem must be correctly formulated before a numerical solution is sought [@problem_id:2403367].", "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional, steady elliptic boundary value problem for the unknown function $u(x)$ on the closed interval $[0,1]$ given by the partial differential equation (PDE)\n$$\nu''(x) \\;=\\; -\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x), \\quad x \\in (0,1).\n$$\nYou must examine how the well-posedness of this second-order elliptic problem depends on the initial and boundary conditions. Specifically, compare the following three boundary-condition scenarios:\n- Scenario A (under-specified): only $u(0)=0$ is prescribed.\n- Scenario B (well-posed): both Dirichlet conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$ are prescribed.\n- Scenario C (over-specified): both Dirichlet conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$ are prescribed, and in addition the Neumann condition $u'(0)=0$ is imposed.\n\nWrite a complete, runnable program that attempts to compute a numerical solution for each scenario and classifies the outcome for each case according to the following convention:\n- Output $0$ if there is a unique solution that is consistent with all conditions.\n- Output $1$ if the problem is under-specified, leading to non-uniqueness.\n- Output $2$ if the problem is over-specified and inconsistent, so no solution satisfies all conditions simultaneously.\n\nYour program must apply the same underlying mathematical model and forcing term for all scenarios and must use the same internal parameters of your choosing for all scenarios in order to make the classification decision in a consistent way. Any mathematically consistent numerical approach may be used to reach the classification decision, but the classification itself must be determined by whether the conditions imply uniqueness, non-uniqueness, or inconsistency for the stated PDE.\n\nTest suite:\n- Scenario A: only $u(0)=0$.\n- Scenario B: $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$.\n- Scenario C: $u(0)=0$, $u(1)=0$, and $u'(0)=0$.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the classification results for Scenarios A, B, and C, in that order, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For example, the format is $[c_1,c_2,c_3]$, where $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ are the integer codes defined above for Scenarios A, B, and C respectively.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-defined mathematical exercise in the analysis of boundary value problems, a fundamental topic in computational engineering. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a rigorous analysis and solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the well-posedness of the one-dimensional elliptic boundary value problem on the interval $[0,1]$:\n$$\nu''(x) = -\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x)\n$$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation. The general solution is found by integrating twice with respect to $x$.\n\nThe first integration yields the derivative $u'(x)$:\n$$\nu'(x) = \\int -\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x) \\,dx = \\pi \\cos(\\pi x) + C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration.\n\nThe second integration yields the general solution $u(x)$:\n$$\nu(x) = \\int (\\pi \\cos(\\pi x) + C_1) \\,dx = \\sin(\\pi x) + C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration. The well-posedness of any specific problem instance depends on whether the provided boundary conditions are sufficient to uniquely determine the two constants, $C_1$ and $C_2$. We will now analyze each scenario.\n\nScenario A: Under-specified problem with one boundary condition, $u(0)=0$.\nWe apply this condition to the general solution:\n$$\nu(0) = \\sin(\\pi \\cdot 0) + C_1 \\cdot 0 + C_2 = 0\n$$\nThis implies $0 + 0 + C_2 = 0$, which simplifies to $C_2 = 0$. The solution is constrained to the form:\n$$\nu(x) = \\sin(\\pi x) + C_1 x\n$$\nThe constant $C_1$ remains undetermined. Since there is no other information to constrain $C_1$, there exists an infinite family of solutions, each corresponding to a different choice of $C_1$. The problem is therefore under-specified, leading to non-uniqueness. The classification code is $1$.\n\nScenario B: Well-posed problem with two Dirichlet boundary conditions, $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$.\nThe first condition, $u(0)=0$, gives $C_2=0$, as determined in Scenario A. Now, we apply the second condition, $u(1)=0$, to the partially constrained solution $u(x) = \\sin(\\pi x) + C_1 x$:\n$$\nu(1) = \\sin(\\pi \\cdot 1) + C_1 \\cdot 1 = 0\n$$\nThis gives $0 + C_1 = 0$, which implies $C_1=0$. Both constants are now uniquely determined: $C_1=0$ and $C_2=0$. This yields the unique solution:\n$$\nu(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)\n$$\nThis solution is consistent with all prescribed conditions. The problem is well-posed, admitting a unique solution. The classification code is $0$.\n\nScenario C: Over-specified problem with three boundary conditions, $u(0)=0$, $u(1)=0$, and $u'(0)=0$.\nFrom the analysis of Scenario B, the first two conditions, $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$, are sufficient to determine a unique solution, $u(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n\nNow, we must check if this unique solution is consistent with the third, additional condition, the Neumann condition $u'(0)=0$. We evaluate the derivative of our unique solution at $x=0$. The derivative is:\n$$\nu'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin(\\pi x)) = \\pi \\cos(\\pi x)\n$$\nAt $x=0$, the value is:\n$$\nu'(0) = \\pi \\cos(\\pi \\cdot 0) = \\pi \\cos(0) = \\pi \\cdot 1 = \\pi\n$$\nThe problem imposes the condition $u'(0)=0$, but the only solution satisfying the other two conditions yields $u'(0)=\\pi$. Since $\\pi \\neq 0$, there is a contradiction. No function can simultaneously satisfy all three conditions. The problem is over-specified and inconsistent. The classification code is $2$.\n\nTo implement a program that arrives at these classifications, we will employ a finite difference method (FDM). We discretize the domain $[0,1]$ into $N$ intervals of size $h=1/N$, with grid points $x_i = i h$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N$. The unknown function values are $u_i \\approx u(x_i)$. The second derivative is approximated by a central difference: $u''(x_i) \\approx (u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1})/h^2$. This converts the differential equation into a system of linear equations. Our program will analyze the properties of this system for each scenario.\n\nFor Scenario A, with only one boundary condition, the resulting linear system will be underdetermined, corresponding to a singular matrix with a rank less than the number of unknowns. This indicates non-uniqueness (code $1$).\n\nFor Scenario B, the two Dirichlet conditions result in a square, non-singular system matrix. A unique solution exists. This is detected by the matrix having full rank (code $0$).\n\nFor Scenario C, we will first solve the well-posed system from Scenario B. Then, we will check if the resulting numerical solution satisfies the third condition, $u'(0)=0$, approximated by $(u_1 - u_0)/h = 0$. As the analytical work shows, this condition will not be met, indicating inconsistency (code $2$).", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the well-posedness of a 1D elliptic BVP under three different\n    boundary condition scenarios and classifies them.\n    - 0: Unique, consistent solution.\n    - 1: Under-specified, non-unique solution.\n    - 2: Over-specified, inconsistent, no solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Numerical parameters\n    N = 100  # Number of spatial intervals\n    h = 1.0 / N  # Step size\n    x = np.linspace(0, 1, N + 1)\n    \n    # Forcing function f(x) = -pi^2 * sin(pi*x)\n    f = -np.pi**2 * np.sin(np.pi * x)\n    \n    # The size of the unknown vector u = [u_0, u_1, ..., u_N] is N+1\n    num_unknowns = N + 1\n    \n    results = []\n\n    # --- Scenario A: u(0) = 0 ---\n    # The problem is under-specified.

The diffusive nature of the heat equation works to smooth this sharp discontinuity, and this practice challenges you to numerically capture this behavior.

This practice demonstrates this principle by using a time-varying boundary condition to excite a one-dimensional system governed by the wave equation.

This exploration of resonance, where a small, targeted input can produce a large response, provides a deep insight into the dynamic interplay between a system's properties and its external interactions, a key concept in structural mechanics, acoustics, and electrical engineering [@problem_id:2403378].", "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional wave equation on a finite interval, posed in dimensionless form to avoid physical units.

It is a well-posed initial-boundary value problem from computational engineering, grounded in the fundamental principles of wave mechanics and numerical analysis. It is free of contradiction, ambiguity, or scientific fallacy. We will proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe solution requires two main parts: first, a theoretical derivation of the natural frequencies of the system, and second, the design and implementation of a numerical solver based on the finite-difference method.\n\nFirst Principle Derivation of Natural Frequencies\n\nTo find the natural frequencies, we must analyze the associated homogeneous problem. This corresponds to the given partial differential equation (PDE) with zero boundary conditions.\nThe PDE is the one-dimensional wave equation:\n$$u_{tt}(x,t) = c^2 u_{xx}(x,t), \\quad x \\in [0, L], \\quad t \\ge 0$$\nThe associated homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are:\n$$u(0,t) = 0, \\quad u(L,t) = 0$$\nWe employ the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE yields:\n$$X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)$$\nRearranging terms to separate the spatial and temporal variables, we get:\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\nSince the left side depends only on time $t$ and the right side depends only on space $x$, both must be equal to a constant. We denote this separation constant as $-\\lambda$. The negative sign is chosen to ensure oscillatory (and thus non-trivial) solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions.\n$$ \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = -\\lambda $$\nThis results in two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1.  Spatial ODE: $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n2.  Temporal ODE: $T''(t) + \\lambda c^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nWe first solve the spatial ODE, which constitutes a Sturm-Liouville boundary value problem. The boundary conditions for $u(x,t)$ translate to conditions on $X(x)$:\n$$X(0) = 0, \\quad X(L) = 0$$\nThe general solution to the spatial ODE is $X(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $X(0) = 0$:\n$$C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 \\cdot 1 + C_2 \\cdot 0 = C_1 = 0$$\nThis reduces the solution to $X(x) = C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $X(L) = 0$:\n$$C_2 \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = 0$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $C_2 \\neq 0$, which implies that $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L)$ must be zero. This condition is met when the argument of the sine function is an integer multiple of $\\pi$:\n$$\\sqrt{\\lambda}L = m\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } m = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nThe case $m=0$ is excluded as it leads to $\\lambda=0$ and the trivial solution $X(x)=0$. Negative integers for $m$ do not produce new independent solutions.\nSolving for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$, we obtain a discrete set of values:\n$$\\lambda_m = \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2, \\quad m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions, or natural mode shapes, are:\n$$X_m(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\nWe now return to the temporal ODE, substituting the eigenvalues $\\lambda_m$:\n$$T_m''(t) + \\lambda_m c^2 T_m(t) = 0$$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The natural angular frequency, $\\omega_m$, is the square root of the coefficient of $T_m(t)$:\n$$\\omega_m^2 = \\lambda_m c^2 = \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 c^2$$\nTaking the positive square root gives the natural angular frequencies:\n$$\\omega_m = \\frac{m\\pi c}{L}, \\quad m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nThis completes the derivation. This formula will be used to set the driving frequency $\\omega = \\omega_m(1+\\delta)$ in the numerical simulation.\n\nFinite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Scheme\n\nWe discretize the domain with a uniform grid. The spatial coordinate is $x_i = i\\Delta x$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_x\\}$, where $\\Delta x = L/N_x$. The time coordinate is $t_n = n\\Delta t$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_t\\}$. We denote the numerical approximation of the field as $u_i^n \\approx u(x_i, t_n)$.\n\nThe PDE $u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}$ is approximated using second-order central differences in both space and time:\n$$\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u_i^{n-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2} = c^2 \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}$$\nSolving for $u_i^{n+1}$, the field at the next time step, gives the explicit update rule for interior grid points ($i=1, \\dots, N_x-1$):\n$$u_i^{n+1} = 2u_i^n - u_i^{n-1} + \\left(\\frac{c\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 (u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n)$$\nDefining the Courant number $r = c\\Delta t/\\Delta x$, the scheme simplifies to:\n$$u_i^{n+1} = 2(1 - r^2)u_i^n + r^2(u_{i+1}^n + u_{i-1}^n) - u_i^{n-1}$$\nThis scheme is stable for $r \\le 1$, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.\n\nThe initial conditions are $u(x,0) = 0$ and $u_t(x,0)=0$.\nFrom $u(x,0)=0$, we set $u_i^0 = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_x\\}$.\nThe time derivative $u_t(x,0)=0$ is used to find the solution at the first time step, $u_i^1$. We use a second-order central difference for the derivative at $t=0$:\n$$\\frac{u_i^1 - u_i^{-1}}{2\\Delta t} = u_t(x_i, 0) = 0 \\implies u_i^{-1} = u_i^1$$\nHere $u_i^{-1}$ is a fictitious \"ghost point\" in time. We substitute this into the update rule for $n=0$:\n$$u_i^1 = 2(1 - r^2)u_i^0 + r^2(u_{i+1}^0 + u_{i-1}^0) - u_i^{-1}$$\nSubstituting $u_i^0=0$ and $u_i^{-1}=u_i^1$:\n$$u_i^1 = 2(1 - r^2)(0) + r^2(0+0) - u_i^1 \\implies 2u_i^1 = 0 \\implies u_i^1 = 0$$\nThis holds for the interior points. For the boundary points, the values are dictated by the boundary conditions.\nAt any time step $n$, the boundary conditions are enforced directly:\n$$u_0^n = g(t_n) = A \\sin(\\omega t_n)$$\n$$u_{N_x}^n = 0$$\nSo, for the initialization:\n- Time $n=0$: $u_i^0 = 0$ for all $i$. Note that $u_0^0=g(0)=A\\sin(0)=0$, which is consistent.\n- Time $n=1$: $u_i^1 = 0$ for interior points $i=1, \\dots, N_x-1$. The boundaries are $u_0^1 = g(\\Delta t)$ and $u_{N_x}^1 = 0$.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by iteratively applying the update rule, starting with these initial states. The maximum absolute displacement at the midpoint, $x=L/2$ (corresponding to index $i=N_x/2$), is recorded at each time step to find the overall maximum $M$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_simulation(L, c, Nx, r, m, delta, A, P):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 1D wave equation using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme.\n\n    Args:\n        L (float): Length of the domain.\n        c (float): Wave speed.\n        Nx (int): Number of spatial subintervals.\n        r (float): Courant number.\n        m (int): Mode index for driving frequency.\n        delta (float): Detuning parameter.\n        A (float): Amplitude of the boundary driving signal.\n        P (int): Number of drive periods to simulate.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The maximum absolute displacement at the spatial midpoint.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
