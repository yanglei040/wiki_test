{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The way an equation is rearranged into the form $x = g(x)$ dramatically affects whether a fixed-point iteration will converge. This practice guides you through a computational experiment to explore the concepts of attracting and repelling fixed points for different iteration schemes. By implementing and testing these schemes for the equation $e^x - 4x = 0$, you will gain a practical understanding of the convergence criterion $|g'(x^*)| \\lt 1$ and the idea of a basin of attraction [@problem_id:2393371].", "problem": "You are to write a complete program that compares convergence behavior and basins of attraction for fixed-point iterations applied to the scalar nonlinear equation $e^{x} - 4x = 0$ under different rearrangements of the form $x = g(x)$. The program must be deterministic and must not require any user input.\n\nBegin from the following fundamental base:\n- Definition of a fixed point for a function $g$: a point $x^{\\star}$ such that $x^{\\star} = g(x^{\\star})$.\n- Fixed-point iteration: given an initial guess $x_0$, generate a sequence $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$.\n- Sufficient local convergence criterion for fixed-point iteration from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem (also known as the Contraction Mapping Principle): if $g$ is continuously differentiable and there exists a neighborhood of a fixed point $x^{\\star}$ in which $\\lvert g'(x) \\rvert \\leq q  1$, then the iteration $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$ converges to $x^{\\star}$ for any $x_0$ in that neighborhood.\n\nTasks for your program:\n1. Implement the nonlinear function $f(x) = e^{x} - 4x$ and its derivative $f'(x) = e^{x} - 4$.\n2. Implement the following three fixed-point maps $g$:\n   - $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = \\dfrac{e^{x}}{4}$, defined for all real $x$.\n   - $g_{\\mathrm{B}}(x) = \\ln(4x)$, defined only for $x  0$.\n   - $g_{\\mathrm{N}}(x) = x - \\dfrac{f(x)}{f'(x)}$ (Newton’s method written as a fixed-point map), defined when $f'(x) \\neq 0$.\n3. For each fixed-point map, implement the iteration $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$ with the following termination and failure criteria:\n   - Convergence if either $\\lvert x_{k+1} - x_k \\rvert \\leq \\varepsilon_x$ or $\\lvert f(x_{k+1}) \\rvert \\leq \\varepsilon_f$, with $\\varepsilon_x = 10^{-12}$ and $\\varepsilon_f = 10^{-12}$.\n   - Failure if any of the following occurs:\n     - The next iterate leaves the domain of the map (for example, for $g_{\\mathrm{B}}$, if at any step $x_k \\leq 0$).\n     - A non-finite value (not-a-number or infinity) is produced at any step.\n     - The maximum number of iterations $N_{\\max} = 200$ is reached without convergence.\n     - For $g_{\\mathrm{N}}$, the derivative magnitude $\\lvert f'(x_k) \\rvert$ is below the threshold $\\tau = 10^{-12}$ at any step, so the update is ill-conditioned.\n4. Compute high-accuracy reference roots for classification. There are exactly two real roots of $f(x) = 0$: one in the interval $[0, 0.5]$ and one in the interval $[2, 3]$. Use a robust bracketed root-finding method (for example, bisection or Brent’s method) to compute reference values $r_1 \\in [0, 0.5]$ and $r_2 \\in [2, 3]$ with absolute accuracy at least $10^{-14}$.\n5. Basin-of-attraction classification: for a converged iterate $x^{\\star}$, classify it by proximity to the two reference roots using the rule\n   - Assign integer $0$ if $\\lvert x^{\\star} - r_1 \\rvert \\leq 10^{-8}$,\n   - Assign integer $1$ if $\\lvert x^{\\star} - r_2 \\rvert \\leq 10^{-8}$,\n   - Otherwise assign integer $-1$.\n   For a failed iteration, assign integer $-1$.\n6. Use the following test suite of $(g,\\ x_0)$ pairs to probe different basins, edge cases, and domains:\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{A}},\\ x_0 = -1.0)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{A}},\\ x_0 = 0.1)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{A}},\\ x_0 = 0.6)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{A}},\\ x_0 = 2.5)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{B}},\\ x_0 = 0.2)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{B}},\\ x_0 = 2.5)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{B}},\\ x_0 = 1.0)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{B}},\\ x_0 = -0.5)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{N}},\\ x_0 = -1.0)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{N}},\\ x_0 = 0.5)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{N}},\\ x_0 = 4.0)$\n   - $(g_{\\mathrm{N}},\\ x_0 = \\ln 4)$\n7.

No additional text should be printed.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Angles are not used in this problem, so no angle unit is required.\n- No physical units are involved.\n- Ensure numerical robustness by strictly applying the domain checks and failure criteria above.", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is found to be sound. It is a well-posed problem in computational engineering, grounded in the established principles of numerical analysis, specifically fixed-point iteration theory and Newton's method. All parameters, functions, and criteria are defined with sufficient precision to permit a unique, deterministic solution. We proceed with the analysis and derivation of the solution.\n\nThe objective is to analyze the convergence of three different fixed-point iteration schemes for finding the roots of the nonlinear equation $f(x) = e^{x} - 4x = 0$.\n\n**1. High-Accuracy Root Determination**\n\nThe equation $f(x) = 0$ is equivalent to finding the intersections of $y = e^x$ and $y = 4x$. A graphical analysis reveals two real roots. The problem statement correctly identifies the intervals containing these roots. To verify, we evaluate $f(x)$ at the interval boundaries:\n- For the interval $[0, 0.5]$:\n  $f(0) = e^{0} - 4(0) = 1  0$.\n  $f(0.5) = e^{0.5} - 4(0.5) = \\sqrt{e} - 2 \\approx 1.6487 - 2 = -0.3513  0$.\n- For the interval $[2, 3]$:\n  $f(2) = e^{2} - 4(2) = e^2 - 8 \\approx 7.3891 - 8 = -0.6109  0$.\n  $f(3) = e^{3} - 4(3) = e^3 - 12 \\approx 20.0855 - 12 = 8.0855  0$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is continuous, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a root in each interval. We denote these roots as $r_1 \\in [0, 0.5]$ and $r_2 \\in [2, 3]$. To serve as a benchmark for classification, these roots are computed to a high accuracy (absolute tolerance of at least $10^{-14}$) using a robust numerical method, specifically Brent's method, which is suitable for this purpose.\n\n**2. Convergence Analysis of Fixed-Point Mappings**\n\nThe convergence of a fixed-point iteration $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$ to a fixed point $x^{\\star}$ is governed by the magnitude of the derivative of the iteration map, $\\lvert g'(x^{\\star}) \\rvert$. For local convergence, it is sufficient that $\\lvert g'(x^{\\star}) \\rvert  1$. If $\\lvert g'(x^{\\star}) \\rvert  1$, the fixed point is repelling, and the iteration will diverge. If $\\lvert g'(x^{\\star}) \\rvert = 1$, the test is inconclusive and a more detailed analysis is required.\n\nThe roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ of $f(x)=0$ are, by definition, fixed points of any valid rearrangement $x=g(x)$. At these points, $e^{x^\\star} = 4x^\\star$.\n\n- **Map A**: $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = \\dfrac{e^x}{4}$.\n  The derivative is $g'_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = \\dfrac{e^x}{4}$.\n  - At the first root $r_1$: $g'_{\\mathrm{A}}(r_1) = \\dfrac{e^{r_1}}{4} = \\dfrac{4r_1}{4} = r_1$. Numerically, $r_1 \\approx 0.3574$. Thus, $\\lvert g'_{\\mathrm{A}}(r_1) \\rvert \\approx 0.3574  1$. The fixed point $r_1$ is attracting.\n  - At the second root $r_2$: $g'_{\\mathrm{A}}(r_2) = \\dfrac{e^{r_2}}{4} = \\dfrac{4r_2}{4} = r_2$. Numerically, $r_2 \\approx 2.1533$. Thus, $\\lvert g'_{\\mathrm{A}}(r_2) \\rvert \\approx 2.1533  1$. The fixed point $r_2$ is repelling.\n  Therefore, the iteration with $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)$ is expected to converge to $r_1$ if started sufficiently close, and to diverge from the vicinity of $r_2$.\n\n- **Map B**: $g_{\\mathrm{B}}(x) = \\ln(4x)$, defined for $x  0$.\n  The derivative is $g'_{\\mathrm{B}}(x) = \\dfrac{1}{4x} \\cdot 4 = \\dfrac{1}{x}$.\n  - At the first root $r_1$: $\\lvert g'_{\\mathrm{B}}(r_1) \\rvert = \\dfrac{1}{r_1} \\approx \\dfrac{1}{0.3574} \\approx 2.798  1$. The fixed point $r_1$ is repelling.\n  - At the second root $r_2$: $\\lvert g'_{\\mathrm{B}}(r_2) \\rvert = \\dfrac{1}{r_2} \\approx \\dfrac{1}{2.1533} \\approx 0.4644  1$. The fixed point $r_2$ is attracting.\n  This map exhibits behavior complementary to $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)$. The iteration is expected to converge to $r_2$ and diverge from $r_1$.\n\n- **Map N (Newton's Method)**: $g_{\\mathrm{N}}(x) = x - \\dfrac{f(x)}{f'(x)}$.\n  Here, $f(x) = e^x - 4x$ and $f'(x) = e^x - 4$. The second derivative is $f''(x) = e^x$.\n  The derivative of the fixed-point map is $g'_{\\mathrm{N}}(x) = \\dfrac{f(x)f''(x)}{(f'(x))^2}$.\n  At any simple root $x^{\\star}$ (where $f(x^{\\star}) = 0$ and $f'(x^{\\star}) \\neq 0$), the derivative is $g'_{\\mathrm{N}}(x^{\\star}) = 0$.\n  For our problem, $f'(r_1) = e^{r_1} - 4 = 4r_1 - 4 \\neq 0$ and $f'(r_2) = e^{r_2} - 4 = 4r_2 - 4 \\neq 0$, so both roots are simple.\n  The condition $g'_{\\mathrm{N}}(x^{\\star}) = 0$ implies quadratic convergence, which is extremely rapid. Both $r_1$ and $r_2$ are super-attracting fixed points for Newton's method. Failure occurs if the iteration encounters a point where $f'(x) = 0$, which is at $x = \\ln(4)$. This point corresponds to the local minimum of $f(x)$.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Implementation and Execution**\n\nThe solution will be implemented in a Python program following a structured, deterministic procedure.\n1.  **Initialization**: Define all constants: convergence tolerances $\\varepsilon_x = 10^{-12}$ and $\\varepsilon_f = 10^{-12}$, maximum iterations $N_{\\max} = 200$, Newton's method derivative threshold $\\tau = 10^{-12}$, and classification tolerance $10^{-8}$.\n2.  **Reference Root Calculation**: The roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ are computed using `scipy.optimize.brentq` to a precision greater than required by the problem.\n3.  **Function Definitions**: The functions $f(x)$, $f'(x)$, $g_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)$, $g_{\\mathrm{B}}(x)$, and $g_{\\mathrm{N}}(x)$ are implemented. The implementations for $g_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{N}}$ include internal checks that raise exceptions for domain violations ($x_k \\leq 0$ for $g_{\\mathrm{B}}$) or an ill-conditioned update ($\\lvert f'(x_k) \\rvert  \\tau$ for $g_{\\mathrm{N}}$), as specified.\n4.  **Iteration Solver**: A master function executes the fixed-point iteration $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$ for a given map $g$ and initial guess $x_0$. This function runs for a maximum of $N_{\\max}$ steps. In each step, it checks for convergence using the criteria $\\lvert x_{k+1} - x_k \\rvert \\leq \\varepsilon_x$ or $\\lvert f(x_{k+1}) \\rvert \\leq \\varepsilon_f$. It also handles failures due to non-finite results or exceptions raised by the map functions. The function returns a status ('converged' or 'failed') and the final iterate.\n5.  **Classification**: A separate classification function takes the output of the solver. If the status is 'failed', it returns $-1$. If 'converged', it compares the final iterate $x^{\\star}$ against the reference roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ using the $\\lvert x^{\\star} - r \\rvert \\leq 10^{-8}$ criterion and returns $0$, $1$, or $-1$ accordingly.\n6.  **Test Suite Execution**: The program iterates through the provided list of test cases. For each $(g, x_0)$ pair, it calls the solver and classifier, handling the edge case where an initial guess is already outside the domain of a map (e.g., $x_0 \\leq 0$ for $g_{\\mathrm{B}}$).\n7.  **Final Output**: The integer classification results are collected in a list and printed in the specified format: `[c_1,c_2,...,c_N]`.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that all problem requirements are met precisely and robustly.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the given problem by comparing fixed-point iterations for f(x) = e^x - 4x = 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define problem parameters\n    EPS_X = 1e-12\n    EPS_F = 1e-12\n    MAX_ITER = 200\n    DERIV_THRESHOLD = 1e-12\n    CLASSIFICATION_TOL = 1e-8\n    ROOT_FINDING_TOL = 1e-15\n\n    # Task 1  4: Implement f(x) and compute high-accuracy reference roots.\n    # The nonlinear function f(x) = e^x - 4x.\n    def f(x):\n        try:\n            val = np.exp(x) - 4.0 * x\n        except OverflowError:\n            val = np.inf\n        return val\n\n    # Its derivative f'(x) = e^x - 4.\n    def f_prime(x):\n        try:\n            val = np.exp(x) - 4.0\n        except OverflowError:\n            val = np.inf\n        return val\n\n    # Use a robust bracketed method to find reference roots r1 and r2.\n    r1 = brentq(f, 0.0, 0.5, xtol=ROOT_FINDING_TOL)\n    r2 = brentq(f, 2.0, 3.0, xtol=ROOT_FINDING_TOL)\n\n    # Task 2: Implement the three fixed-point maps.\n    # g_A(x) = e^x / 4\n    def g_A(x):\n        return np.exp(x) / 4.0\n\n    # g_B(x) = ln(4x), defined for x  0.\n    def g_B(x):\n        if x = 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Domain error for g_B: x must be  0.\")\n        return np.log(4.0 * x)\n\n    # g_N(x) = x - f(x)/f'(x) (Newton's method).\n    def g_N(x):\n        f_prime_val = f_prime(x)\n        if abs(f_prime_val)  DERIV_THRESHOLD:\n            raise ValueError(\"Derivative near zero for g_N.\")\n        return x - f(x) / f_prime_val\n\n    g_map = {'A': g_A, 'B': g_B, 'N': g_N}\n\n    # Task 3  5: Implement the iteration and classification logic.\n    def run_iteration_and_classify(g_name, x0):\n        # Handle cases where initial guess is invalid.\n        if g_name == 'B' and x0 = 0:\n            return -1\n        if g_name == 'N' and abs(f_prime(x0))  DERIV_THRESHOLD:\n            return -1\n\n        g_func = g_map[g_name]\n        x_k = x0\n\n        for _ in range(MAX_ITER):\n            try:\n                x_k_plus_1 = g_func(x_k)\n            except (ValueError, OverflowError):\n                # Catches domain errors from g_B, derivative error from g_N,\n                # and overflow in exp().\n                return -1\n\n            # Check for failure due to non-finite values.\n            if not np.isfinite(x_k_plus_1):\n                return -1\n\n            # Check for convergence.\n            converged_x_step = abs(x_k_plus_1 - x_k) = EPS_X\n            converged_f_val = abs(f(x_k_plus_1)) = EPS_F\n            \n            if converged_x_step or converged_f_val:\n                x_star = x_k_plus_1\n                # Classify the converged root.\n                if abs(x_star - r1) = CLASSIFICATION_TOL:\n                    return 0\n                elif abs(x_star - r2) = CLASSIFICATION_TOL:\n                    return 1\n                else:\n                    return -1 # Converged to a non-target or with insufficient precision for classification\n            \n            x_k = x_k_plus_1\n\n        # Failure due to reaching max iterations.\n        return -1\n\n    # Task 6: Define and run the test suite.\n    test_cases = [\n        ('A', -1.0),\n        ('A', 0.1),\n        ('A', 0.6),\n        ('A', 2.5),\n        ('B', 0.2),\n        ('B', 2.5),\n        ('B', 1.0),\n        ('B', -0.5), # Fails on initial condition\n        ('N', -1.0),\n        ('N', 0.5),\n        ('N', 4.0),\n        ('N', np.log(4.0)) # Fails on initial condition\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for g_name, x0 in test_cases:\n        result = run_iteration_and_classify(g_name, x0)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Task 7: Output a single line in the specified format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\n# Execute the main function.\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2393371"}, {"introduction": "Fixed-point iteration is a powerful tool for solving the implicit equations that are common in engineering, such as the Colebrook equation for pipe friction.

Numerical Schemes and Convergence Criteria**\n\n**a) Standard Fixed-Point Iteration**\nThe standard fixed-point iteration algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Start with an initial guess $f_0$.\n2.  For $n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$, compute the next estimate using the mapping: $f_{n+1} = g(f_n)$.\n3.  The process is terminated when the absolute difference between successive estimates is less than a specified tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-12}$, i.e., $|f_{n+1} - f_n|  \\tau$.\n4.  The iteration count, $n_{\\mathrm{std}}$, is the total number of times the mapping $f_{n+1} = g(f_n)$ is computed.\n5.  The evaluation count, $e_{\\mathrm{std}}$, is the total number of calls to the function $g(f)$. For this method, $e_{\\mathrm{std}} = n_{\\mathrm{std}}$. The process is also capped at $N_{\\max}^{(\\mathrm{std})} = 200$ iterations.\n\n**b) Steffensen's Method**\nSteffensen's method is an acceleration technique that typically converts the linear convergence of a fixed-point iteration into quadratic convergence. It uses three points from the underlying fixed-point sequence to extrapolate a better estimate.\n1.  Start with an initial guess $f_0$.\n2.  For each step $n$:\n    a. Let the current estimate be $p_0 = f_n$.\n    b. Generate two intermediate values using the mapping $g$: $p_1 = g(p_0)$ and $p_2 = g(p_1)$.\n    c. Compute the accelerated update using the Aitken's $\\Delta^2$ formula:\n    $$\n    f_{n+1} = p_0 - \\frac{(p_1 - p_0)^2}{p_2 - 2p_1 + p_0}\n    $$\n3.  Termination is based on the same criterion: $|f_{n+1} - f_n|  \\tau = 10^{-12}$.\n4.  One full cycle of the above constitutes a single iteration step for Steffensen's method. The iteration count is $n_{\\mathrm{st}}$.\n5.  Since each step requires two evaluations of the mapping function $g(f)$, the total evaluation count is $e_{\\mathrm{st}} = 2 \\times n_{\\mathrm{st}}$. The process is capped at $N_{\\max}^{(\\mathrm{st})} = 100$ iterations.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by defining functions for the mapping $g(f)$, the initial guess, and the two iterative solvers.

This condition is met if and only if the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix, $\\rho(J_G(\\mathbf{x}^{\\star}))$, is strictly less than $1$. If $\\rho(J_G(\\mathbf{x}^{\\star}))  1$, the iteration is locally divergent.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving the effective iteration map $G$ and its Jacobian for both the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel schemes.
