The function $f(t, T)$ is:\n$$ f(t, T) = -kT + k(T_0 + A \\sin(\\omega t)) $$\n\nThe stability of the explicit Euler method for a linear ODE is determined by the behavior of its homogeneous part. We can analyze the stability by considering a test equation of the form $y' = \\lambda y$, where $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue of the system's Jacobian matrix. For a single linear ODE, $\\lambda$ is simply the coefficient of the dependent variable.\n\nIn our equation, the coefficient of $T$ is $-k$. So, we set $\\lambda = -k$. The non-homogeneous part of the equation, $g(t) = k(T_0 + A \\sin(\\omega t))$, and the initial condition $T(0) = T_i$ do not affect the stability condition of the method itself.\n\nThe explicit Euler method applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ is:\n$$ y_{n+1} = y_n + h(\\lambda y_n) = (1 + h\\lambda) y_n $$\nFor the numerical solution to remain stable (not grow unboundedly), the magnitude of the amplification factor $(1 + h\\lambda)$ must be less than or equal to one. This gives the stability condition:\n$$ |1 + h\\lambda| \\le 1 $$\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\lambda = -k$ into this condition:\n$$ |1 + h(-k)| \\le 1 $$\n$$ |1 - hk| \\le 1 $$\nThis absolute value inequality is equivalent to the compound inequality:\n$$ -1 \\le 1 - hk \\le 1 $$\nWe can split this into two separate inequalities:\n\n1.  $1 - hk \\le 1$\n    $$ -hk \\le 0 $$\n    Since both the time step $h$ and the rate constant $k$ are positive physical quantities ($h>0, k>0$), their product $hk$ is always positive.

The stability of the explicit Euler method for an equation of the form $y' = \\lambda y$ is governed by the condition $|1 + h\\lambda| \\le 1$. For the second component of the system, we have $\\lambda_2 = -100$ and $h=0.05$. This gives $|1 + (0.05)(-100)| = |1 - 5| = |-4| = 4$. Since $4 > 1$, the time step $h=0.05$ violates the stability condition for the faster-decaying component.\n\nThis violation does not render the problem invalid.

This is a first-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients. Its solution can be found by induction.

Let us analyze the magnitude of $w_n$:\n$$|w_n| = |(1+z)^n w_0| = |(1+z)^n| |w_0| = |1+z|^n |w_0|$$\nLet $R = |1+z|$. Then, $|w_n| = R^n |w_0|$. The stability of the system depends entirely on the value of $R$.\n\n1.  **Stability Analysis**: We use the provided definitions.\n    - If $R  1$, then $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} R^n = 0$. Consequently, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |w_n| = 0$, which implies $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} w_n = 0$ for any $w_0$. This corresponds to asymptotic stability. Thus, $S(z)=1$.\n    - If $R = 1$, then $|w_n| = 1^n |w_0| = |w_0|$ for all $n$. For any $w_0 \\neq 0$, the sequence of magnitudes $\\{|w_n|\\}$ is a constant positive sequence $\\{|w_0|, |w_0|, \\dots\\}$. It is bounded but does not converge to $0$. This matches the definition of neutral stability. Thus, $S(z)=0$.\n    - If $R > 1$, then $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} R^n = \\infty$. For any $w_0 \\neq 0$, the sequence $\\{|w_n|\\}$ is unbounded. This corresponds to instability. Thus, $S(z)=-1$.\n    In summary, the stability classification $S(z)$ is determined by comparing $|1+z|$ to $1$.\n\n2.  **Divergence Rate Analysis**: The divergence rate $g(z)$ is defined as:\n    $$g(z) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\,\\ln |w_n|$$\n    Assuming a non-trivial initial condition $w_0 \\neq 0$, we substitute $|w_n| = R^n |w_0|$:\n    $$g(z) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\,\\ln (R^n |w_0|) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\,(n \\ln R + \\ln|w_0|) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\ln R + \\frac{\\ln|w_0|}{n} \\right)$$\n    As $n \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{\\ln|w_0|}{n} \\to 0$. Therefore, the limit is:\n    $$g(z) = \\ln R = \\ln|1+z|$$\n    A special case arises if $|1+z|=0$, which occurs when $z=-1$. In this case, $w_n=0$ for $n \\ge 1$, and $\\ln|w_n| = \\ln(0) = -\\infty$. The limit $g(-1)$ is $-\\infty$. This is consistent with the formula $g(-1) = \\ln|1-1| = \\ln(0)$.\n\nNow we apply these findings to each $z_k$ from the test suite.\n\n- For $z_1 = -0.5 + 0.0\\,\\mathrm{i}$:\n  $1+z_1 = 0.5 + 0.0\\,\\mathrm{i}$.\n  $R_1 = |1+z_1| = 0.5$.\n  Since $R_1  1$, the system is asymptotically stable, $S(z_1)=1$.\n  $g(z_1) = \\ln(0.5) \\approx -0.693147$.\n\n- For $z_2 = -2.0 + 0.0\\,\\mathrm{i}$:\n  $1+z_2 = -1.0 + 0.0\\,\\mathrm{i}$.\n  $R_2 = |1+z_2| = 1$.\n  Since $R_2 = 1$, the system is neutrally stable, $S(z_2)=0$.\n  $g(z_2) = \\ln(1) = 0.000000$.\n\n- For $z_3 = 0.2 + 0.3\\,\\mathrm{i}$:\n  $1+z_3 = 1.2 + 0.3\\,\\mathrm{i}$.\n  $R_3 = |1+z_3| = \\sqrt{1.2^2 + 0.3^2} = \\sqrt{1.44 + 0.09} = \\sqrt{1.53}$.\n  Since $R_3 = \\sqrt{1.53} \\approx 1.2369 > 1$, the system is unstable, $S(z_3)=-1$.\n  $g(z_3) = \\ln(\\sqrt{1.53}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1.53) \\approx 0.212634$.\n\n- For $z_4 = -1.0 + 0.0\\,\\mathrm{i}$:\n  $1+z_4 = 0.0 + 0.0\\,\\mathrm{i}$.\n  $R_4 = |1+z_4| = 0$.\n  Since $R_4  1$, the system is asymptotically stable, $S(z_4)=1$. The sequence reaches $0$ in one step.\n  $g(z_4) = \\ln(0) = -\\infty$.\n\n- For $z_5 = -0.5 + 0.8660254037844386\\,\\mathrm{i}$:\n  This is $z_5 = -0.5 + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n  $1+z_5 = 0.5 + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n  $R_5 = |1+z_5| = \\sqrt{(0.5)^2 + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{0.25 + 0.75} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\n  Since $R_5 = 1$, the system is neutrally stable, $S(z_5)=0$.\n  $g(z_5) = \\ln(1) = 0.000000$.\n\n- For $z_6 = -1.0 + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{i}$:\n  $1+z_6 = 0.0 + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{i}$.\n  $R_6 = |1+z_6| = |0.5\\mathrm{i}| = 0.5$.\n  Since $R_6  1$, the system is asymptotically stable, $S(z_6)=1$.\n  $g(z_6) = \\ln(0.5) \\approx -0.693147$.\n\n- For $z_7 = 1.0 + 0.0\\,\\mathrm{i}$:\n  $1+z_7 = 2.0 + 0.0\\,\\mathrm{i}$.\n  $R_7 = |1+z_7| = 2$.\n  Since $R_7 > 1$, the system is unstable, $S(z_7)=-1$.\n  $g(z_7) = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$.\n\nThese calculations provide all the necessary values for constructing the final output.
