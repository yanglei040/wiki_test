Due to the size of the matrix $A$, direct methods like Gaussian elimination are often computationally prohibitive. Instead, iterative solvers such as the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method are used.\n\nTo accelerate the convergence of such iterative solvers, a technique called preconditioning is employed.

Your task is to implement a Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with different preconditioners and investigate how floating point precision (single versus double versus mixed) affects preconditioner stability and utility as measured by iteration counts to a fixed accuracy.\n\nStarting from fundamental bases:\n- The Conjugate Gradient method solves $A x = b$ for symmetric positive definite $A$ by iteratively minimizing the $A$-energy norm of the error over expanding Krylov subspaces generated by $A$ and the residual, using orthogonality of residuals and $A$-conjugacy of directions. \n- A left preconditioner $M$ that is symmetric positive definite transforms the system to $M^{-1} A x = M^{-1} b$, changing the inner product to $\\langle u, v \\rangle_M = u^\\top M v$, which in practice reduces the condition number of the operator applied in the Krylov process and thus improves convergence rates when $M$ is a good approximation to $A$.\n- A standard sparse approximate factorization for symmetric positive definite matrices is incomplete Cholesky factorization with zero fill, denoted $\\text{IC}(0)$, which computes a lower triangular factor $L$ constrained to the lower-triangular sparsity pattern of $A$ such that $L L^\\top \\approx A$.

Implementation of the various preconditioners, with particular attention to the Incomplete Cholesky factorization and its numerical stability under different floating-point precisions.\n\n**1. Matrix Assembly**\n\nThe matrix $A$ is constructed using the Kronecker product. Given $m$, $a_x$, and $a_y$, the matrices $T_x$ and $T_y$ are assembled as sparse tridiagonal matrices. Using the properties of the Kronecker product, $I_m \\otimes T_x$ yields a block-diagonal matrix where each block is $T_x$. Similarly, $T_y \\otimes I_m$ produces a block-tridiagonal matrix where the diagonal blocks are $2a_y I_m$ and the off-diagonal blocks are $-a_y I_m$. Their sum gives the matrix $A$, which has a block-tridiagonal structure and contains at most $5$ non-zero elements per row. All computations for assembling $A$ are performed in $64$-bit precision (double precision). The resulting matrix is stored in the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format.\n\n**2. The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) Method**\n\nThe PCG method is an iterative algorithm for solving SPD linear systems. It improves upon the Conjugate Gradient method by using a preconditioner $M \\approx A$ to transform the system, accelerating convergence by clustering the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix $M^{-1}A$. The algorithm, performed entirely in $64$-bit arithmetic, is as follows:\n\nGiven an initial guess $x_0$ (we use $x_0 = \\mathbf{0}$), a tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-8}$, and a maximum of $k_{\\max} = 5000$ iterations:\n1.  Initialize residual: $r_0 = b - A x_0$.\n2.  Apply preconditioner: $z_0 = M^{-1} r_0$.\n3.  Set initial search direction: $p_0 = z_0$.\n4.  For $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ until convergence or $k_{\\max}$:\n    a. Compute step size: $\\alpha_k = \\frac{r_k^\\top z_k}{p_k^\\top A p_k}$.\n    b. Update solution: $x_{k+1} = x_k + \\alpha_k p_k$.\n    c. Update residual: $r_{k+1} = r_k - \\alpha_k A p_k$.\n    d. Check for convergence: if $\\|r_{k+1}\\|_2 / \\|b\\|_2 \\le \\tau$, stop and return $k+1$.\n    e. Apply preconditioner: $z_{k+1} = M^{-1} r_{k+1}$.\n    f. Update search direction: $\\beta_k = \\frac{r_{k+1}^\\top z_{k+1}}{r_k^\\top z_k}$, then $p_{k+1} = z_{k+1} + \\beta_k p_k$.\n\nThe core of the investigation lies in the implementation of the preconditioning step $z = M^{-1} r$.\n\n**3. Preconditioner Implementations**\n\nWe implement five different choices for the preconditioner $M$.\n\n-   **No Preconditioner**: $M = I$, the identity matrix. The operation $M^{-1}r$ is simply $z=r$. This corresponds to the standard Conjugate Gradient method.\n-   **Jacobi Preconditioner**: $M = \\mathrm{diag}(A)$. This is a simple diagonal scaling. For the given matrix $A$, the diagonal is constant and equal to $2(a_x+a_y)$. The operation $M^{-1}r$ is a component-wise division: $z_i = r_i / (2(a_x+a_y))$.\n-   **Incomplete Cholesky Factorization with Zero Fill (IC(0))**: This preconditioner computes an approximate Cholesky factorization $M = LL^\\top \\approx A$, where the lower triangular factor $L$ is constrained to have the same sparsity pattern as the lower part of $A$. The preconditioning step $z = M^{-1}r$ is performed by solving two triangular systems: $Ly=r$ (forward substitution) and $L^\\top z=y$ (backward substitution).\n\n    The IC(0) factor $L$ is computed via the following algorithm. For $i=0, \\dots, n-1$:\n    $$l_{ij} = \\frac{1}{l_{jj}} \\left( a_{ij} - \\sum_{k=0}^{j-1} l_{ik} l_{jk} \\right) \\quad \\text{for } j  i \\text{ and } a_{ij} \\ne 0$$\n    $$l_{ii} = \\sqrt{a_{ii} - \\sum_{k=0}^{i-1} l_{ik}^2}$$\n    For the graph of the $5$-point stencil matrix, which contains no cycles of length $3$, the sum $\\sum_{kj} l_{ik} l_{jk}$ is always zero. This simplifies the computation of off-diagonal elements to $l_{ij} = a_{ij} / l_{jj}$.\n\n    In finite precision arithmetic, the term under the square root for $l_{ii}$ can become non-positive. To prevent breakdown, we stabilize the factorization. If $a_{ii} - \\sum_{ki} l_{ik}^2 \\le 0$, we replace the diagonal value with $d_i + \\delta$, where $d_i$ is the original diagonal entry of $A$ and $\\delta = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$, with $\\varepsilon$ being the machine epsilon of the working precision.\n\n    We implement three variants of the IC(0) preconditioner:\n    1.  **Double Precision IC(0)**: The factor $L_{64}$ is computed and applied entirely in $64$-bit arithmetic.\n    2.  **Single Precision IC(0)**: The matrix $A$ is cast to $32$-bit precision. The factor $L_{32}$ is computed in $32$-bit precision (with stabilization using $\\varepsilon_{32}$), and the number of stabilizations is recorded. The triangular solves for $z=M^{-1}r$ are also performed in $32$-bit precision: the $64$-bit residual $r$ is cast to $32$-bit, the solves are performed, and the resulting $32$-bit vector $z$ is cast back to $64$-bit.\n    3.  **Mixed Precision IC(0)**: The factor $L_{32}$ is computed as in the single-precision case. However, it is then cast to a $64$-bit matrix before the PCG iteration begins. The triangular solves are subsequently performed entirely in $64$-bit arithmetic. This approach aims to benefit from the faster computation of the $L_{32}$ factor while maintaining the numerical stability of $64$-bit solves.\n\nThe following Python code implements this complete procedure for the specified test cases.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.sparse as sp\nfrom scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve_triangular\n\ndef assemble_A(m, ax, ay):\n    \"\"\"\n    Assembles the 2D anisotropic diffusion matrix A using Kronecker products.\n    A = I_m kron T_x + T_y kron I_m\n    \"\"\"\n    n = m * m\n    \n    # Define T_x and T_y matrices\n    tx_diagonals = [-ax * np.ones(m -
