It requires the application of a standard, well-defined numerical integration formula, Boole's rule, to a polynomial function. The function is a polynomial of degree $4$. A key property of the closed $n$-point Newton–Cotes formula is its degree of precision. For an even value of $n$, the formula is exact for all polynomials of degree up to and including $n+1$. In this case, $n=4$ (even), so the degree of precision is $4+1 = 5$. Since the given function is a polynomial of degree $4$, which is less than or equal to $5$, Boole's rule will yield the exact value of the integral, not an approximation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information, and is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe closed Newton–Cotes formula for $n=4$, known as Boole's rule, for an integral over the interval $[a, b]$ is given by:\n$$ \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\frac{b-a}{90} [7f(x_0) + 32f(x_1) + 12f(x_2) + 32f(x_3) + 7f(x_4)] $$\nThis can also be written using the step size $h = \\frac{b-a}{n}$. With $n=4$, this becomes:\n$$ \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\frac{4h}{90} [7f(x_0) + 32f(x_1) + 12f(x_2) + 32f(x_3) + 7f(x_4)] = \\frac{2h}{45} [7f(x_0) + 32f(x_1) + 12f(x_2) + 32f(x_3) + 7f(x_4)] $$\nwhere the evaluation points are $x_i = a + ih$ for $i=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nFor this specific problem, we have:\n- Interval $[a, b] = [0, 4]$.\n- Number of subintervals $n=4$.\n- The step size is $h = \\frac{b-a}{n} = \\frac{4-0}{4} = 1$.\n\nThe five equally spaced points are:\n- $x_0 = a + 0h = 0 + 0(1) = 0$\n- $x_1 = a + 1h = 0 + 1(1) = 1$\n- $x_2 = a + 2h = 0 + 2(1) = 2$\n- $x_3 = a + 3h = 0 + 3(1) = 3$\n- $x_4 = a + 4h = 0 + 4(1) = 4$\n\nNext, we evaluate the function $f(x) = 2x^{4} - x^{3} + 3x^{2} - 5x + 1$ at these points:\n- $f(x_0) = f(0) = 2(0)^{4} - (0)^{3} + 3(0)^{2} - 5(0) + 1 = 1$\n- $f(x_1) = f(1) = 2(1)^{4} - (1)^{3} + 3(1)^{2} - 5(1) + 1 = 2 - 1 + 3 - 5 + 1 = 0$\n- $f(x_2) = f(2) = 2(2)^{4} - (2)^{3} + 3(2)^{2} - 5(2) + 1 = 2(16) - 8 + 3(4) - 10 + 1 = 32 - 8 + 12 - 10 + 1 = 27$\n- $f(x_3) = f(3) = 2(3)^{4} - (3)^{3} + 3(3)^{2} - 5(3) + 1 = 2(81) - 27 + 3(9) - 15 + 1 = 162 - 27 + 27 - 15 + 1 = 148$\n- $f(x_4) = f(4) = 2(4)^{4} - (4)^{3} + 3(4)^{2} - 5(4) + 1 = 2(256) - 64 + 3(16) - 20 + 1 = 512 - 64 + 48 - 20 + 1 = 477$\n\nNow, substitute these values into Boole's rule:\n$$ I = \\frac{2(1)}{45} [7f(0) + 32f(1) + 12f(2) + 32f(3) + 7f(4)] $$\n$$ I = \\frac{2}{45} [7(1) + 32(0) + 12(27) + 32(148) + 7(477)] $$\n$$ I = \\frac{2}{45} [7 + 0 + 324 + 4736 + 3339] $$\nThe sum inside the brackets is:\n$$ 7 + 324 + 4736 + 3339 = 331 + 4736 + 3339 = 5067 + 3339 = 8406 $$\nSubstituting this sum back into the expression for $I$:\n$$ I = \\frac{2}{45} (8406) = \\frac{16812}{45} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we note that the sum of the digits of the numerator is $1+6+8+1+2=18$, which is divisible by $9$. The denominator $45$ is also divisible by $9$.\n$$ I = \\frac{16812 \\div 9}{45 \\div 9} = \\frac{1868}{5} $$\nAs established, this result is exact.

It constitutes a standard exercise in numerical analysis. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to approximate the definite integral\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\,dx \\quad \\text{where} \\quad f(x) = \\frac{4}{1+x^2}\n$$\nusing the composite Simpson's rule for a sequence of partitions and to analyze the convergence of the approximation. The exact value of the integral is known to be $I = \\pi$.\n\nThe composite Simpson's rule, which is the closed Newton–Cotes formula of degree $2$, approximates the integral over an interval $[a, b]$ by dividing it into an even number $N$ of subintervals of equal width $h = (b-a)/N$. The formula is given by:\n$$\nS_N = \\frac{h}{3} \\left[ f(x_0) + 4\\sum_{i=1, i \\text{ odd}}^{N-1} f(x_i) + 2\\sum_{i=2, i \\text{ even}}^{N-2} f(x_i) + f(x_N) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $x_i = a + ih$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N$. For this problem, the interval is $[0, 1]$, so $a=0$, $b=1$, and the step size is $h=1/N$. The evaluation points, or nodes, are $x_i = i/N$.\n\nThe accuracy of this approximation for a given $N$ is measured by the absolute error, defined as:\n$$\nE_N = |S_N - \\pi|\n$$\n\nTo quantify the rate of convergence as $N$ increases, we compute the observed order of convergence, $p_k$, for each successive pair of subinterval counts $(N_k, N_{k+1})$ from the test suite $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$. The formula for this measure is:\n$$\np_{k} = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{E_{N_{k}}}{E_{N_{k+1}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis calculation is relevant for the specific refinement strategy where each step doubles the number of intervals, i.e., $N_{k+1} = 2N_k$.\n\nThe error of the composite Simpson's rule for a sufficiently smooth function is given by the leading term of the Euler-Maclaurin formula, which is:\n$$\nI - S_N = -\\frac{(b-a)h^4}{180} f^{(4)}(\\xi)\n$$\nfor some $\\xi \\in (a,b)$. This implies an error dependence of $E_N \\propto h^4$ or, equivalently, $E_N \\propto N^{-4}$. When we double the number of subintervals, such that $N_{k+1} = 2N_k$, the step size is halved, $h_{k+1} = h_k/2$. The ratio of successive errors is therefore expected to approach a constant value as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{N_k}}{E_{N_{k+1}}} \\approx \\frac{C \\cdot h_k^4}{C \\cdot (h_k/2)^4} = 2^4 = 16\n$$\nConsequently, the theoretical order of convergence is $p = \\log_2(16) = 4$. The computed values $p_k$ are expected to approach $4$ as $N$ becomes large and the asymptotic error behavior dominates. Deviations from this value for small $N$ are anticipated due to the influence of higher-order error terms and the non-constant nature of the fourth derivative $f^{(4)}(x)$ over the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. Define the integrand $f(x) = \\frac{4}{1+x^2}$.\n2. For each number of subintervals $N$ in the set $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$:\n   a. Compute the step size $h = 1/N$.\n   b.

The function is not differentiable at $x=0$, so the formal error order may not be observed; nonetheless, the construction remains valid and produces a finite approximation with a well-defined absolute error.\n\nThe program computes these absolute errors in the specified order and prints them as a single bracketed, comma-separated list.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef composite_trapezoid(f, a, b, n):\n    \"\"\"Composite trapezoidal rule on [a,b] with n subintervals.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 0 or a == b:\n        # Handle zero-length interval or non-positive n robustly\n        return 0.0\n    x = np.linspace(a, b, n + 1)\n    fx = f(x)\n    h = (b - a) / n\n    # Trapezoidal sum: h * (0.5*f(a) + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_i) + 0.5*f(b))\n    return h * (0.5 * fx[0] + fx[1:-1].sum() + 0.5 * fx[-1])\n\ndef higher_order_from_trap(f, a, b, n):\n    \"\"\"Construct higher-order estimate from T(h) and T(h/2).\"\"\"\n    T_h = composite_trapezoid(f, a, b, n)\n    T_h2 = composite_trapezoid(f, a, b, 2 * n if n > 0 else 0)\n    # Linear combination that cancels the leading h^2 error term\n    return (4.0 * T_h2 - T_h) / 3.0\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Angles are in radians.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: f(x) = exp(x) on [0,1], n=10, exact = e - 1\n        {\n            \"f\": lambda x: np.exp(x),\n            \"a\": 0.0,\n            \"b\": 1.0,\n            \"n\": 10,\n            \"I_exact\": np.e - 1.0,\n        },\n        # Case B: f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 5 on [-2,2], n=8, exact = -92/3\n        {\n            \"f\": lambda x: 3.0 * x**3 - 2.0 * x**2 + x - 5.0,\n            \"a\": -2.0,\n            \"b\": 2.0,\n            \"n\": 8,\n            \"I_exact\": -92.0 / 3.0,\n        },\n        # Case C: f(x) = cos(x) on [pi, pi], n=4, exact = 0\n        {\n            \"f\": lambda x: np.cos(x),\n            \"a\": float(np.pi),\n            \"b\": float(np.pi),\n            \"n\": 4,\n            \"I_exact\": 0.0,\n        },\n        # Case D: f(x) = sin(5x) on [0, pi], n=16, exact = 2/5\n        {\n            \"f\": lambda x: np.sin(5.0 * x),\n            \"a\": 0.0,\n            \"b\": float(np.pi),\n            \"n\": 16,\n            \"I_exact\": 2.0 / 5.0,\n        },\n        # Case E: f(x) = |x| on [-1,1], n=64, exact = 1\n        {\n            \"f\": lambda x: np.abs(x),\n            \"a\": -1.0,\n            \"b\": 1.0,\n            \"n\": 64,\n            \"I_exact\": 1.0,\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        f = case[\"f\"]\n        a = case[\"a\"]\n        b = case[\"b\"]\n        n = case[\"n\"]\n        exact = case[\"I_exact\"]\n        I_hat = higher_order_from_trap(f, a, b, n)\n        abs_err = abs(I_hat - exact)\n        results.append(abs_err)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2419361"}]}
