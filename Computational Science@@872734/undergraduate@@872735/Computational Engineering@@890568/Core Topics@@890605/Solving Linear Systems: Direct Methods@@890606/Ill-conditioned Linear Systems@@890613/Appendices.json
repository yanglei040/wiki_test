The provided data and definitions are standard and consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with a full analysis.\n\nThe core of this problem is the distinction between two types of ill-conditioning: one arising from poor scaling of variables, which can be remedied by a change of basis (preconditioning), and another arising from the intrinsic near-singularity of an operator, which cannot be fixed by a simple change of basis.\n\nFirst, we analyze System $\\mathrm{S1}$: $A_1 x = b$.\nThe matrix is $A_1 = Q D$, where $Q = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is an orthogonal matrix and $D = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/\\alpha \\end{bmatrix}$ is a diagonal matrix with $\\alpha = 10^6$.\nThe structure $A_1 = Q D$ is related to the singular value decomposition (SVD). Since $Q$ is orthogonal, the singular values of $A_1$ are the absolute values of the diagonal entries of $D$.\nThe singular values are $\\sigma_{\\max} = \\alpha = 10^6$ and $\\sigma_{\\min} = 1/\\alpha = 10^{-6}$.\nThe $2$-norm condition number is defined as $\\kappa_2(A) = \\|A\\|_2 \\|A^{-1}\\|_2$. For any matrix, $\\|A\\|_2 = \\sigma_{\\max}$ and $\\|A^{-1}\\|_2 = 1/\\sigma_{\\min}$.\nThus, the condition number of $A_1$ is:\n$$ \\kappa_2(A_1) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{\\sigma_{\\min}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1/\\alpha} = \\alpha^2 = (10^6)^2 = 10^{12} $$\nThis system is extremely ill-conditioned.\n\nSecond, we analyze System $\\mathrm{S2}$: $A_2 x = b$.\nThe matrix is $A_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1+\\epsilon \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\epsilon = 10^{-8}$.\nThis matrix is symmetric. For a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, the singular values are its eigenvalues. We check if $A_2$ is SPD. The trace is $\\text{tr}(A_2) = 1 + (1+\\epsilon) = 2+\\epsilon > 0$. The determinant is $\\det(A_2) = 1(1+\\epsilon) - 1^2 = \\epsilon > 0$. Since both are positive, the eigenvalues are positive, and the matrix is SPD.\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A_2 - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ (1-\\lambda)(1+\\epsilon-\\lambda) - 1 = 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 - (2+\\epsilon)\\lambda + \\epsilon = 0 $$\nThe roots are:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{2+\\epsilon \\pm \\sqrt{(2+\\epsilon)^2 - 4\\epsilon}}{2} = \\frac{2+\\epsilon \\pm \\sqrt{4+4\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2 - 4\\epsilon}}{2} = \\frac{2+\\epsilon \\pm \\sqrt{4+\\epsilon^2}}{2} $$\nFor small $\\epsilon$, we use the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{4+\\epsilon^2} = 2\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2/4} \\approx 2(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{4}) = 2+\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{4}$.\nThe eigenvalues are approximately:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{2+\\epsilon + (2+\\epsilon^2/4)}{2} = 2 + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} + \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{8} \\approx 2 $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{2+\\epsilon - (2+\\epsilon^2/4)}{2} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} - \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{8} \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} $$\nThe condition number of $A_2$ is:\n$$ \\kappa_2(A_2) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}}{\\lambda_{\\min}} \\approx \\frac{2}{\\epsilon/2} = \\frac{4}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{4}{10^{-8}} = 4 \\times 10^8 $$\nThis system is also extremely ill-conditioned. This ill-conditioning arises because as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, $A_2$ approaches a singular matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In $\\mathrm{S1}$, $\\kappa_2(A_1)$ is large, but there exists a simple diagonal change of variables that yields a transformed system matrix with $\\kappa_2$ equal to $1$ while leaving the mapping $b \\mapsto x$ unchanged.**\nWe have established that $\\kappa_2(A_1) = 10^{12}$ is large. The ill-conditioning is due to the scaling matrix $D$. Let's introduce a diagonal change of variables $x=Ty$. The new system is $(A_1 T) y = b$. We seek a diagonal matrix $T$ that conditions the system. A logical choice is one that counteracts the effect of $D$. Let's choose $T = D^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1/\\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\alpha \\end{bmatrix}$. This is a simple diagonal matrix.\nThe new system matrix is $\\tilde{A}_1 = A_1 T = (Q D) D^{-1} = Q I = Q$.\nThe matrix $Q$ is orthogonal. For any orthogonal matrix, its singular values are all $1$. Thus, $\\|Q\\|_2=1$ and $\\|Q^{-1}\\|_2=1$. The condition number is $\\kappa_2(Q) = 1$. So we have found a change of variables that makes the new system perfectly conditioned.\nThe mapping from $b$ to $x$ is given by $x=A_1^{-1}b$. A change of variables is a technique to solve the system; it does not alter this fundamental relationship. After solving for $y = (A_1 T)^{-1} b$, one recovers $x$ via $x = T y = T (A_1 T)^{-1} b = T T^{-1} A_1^{-1} b = A_1^{-1} b$. The mapping is unchanged. The statement is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In $\\mathrm{S2}$, any orthogonal change of basis applied to the unknowns cannot reduce the $2$-norm condition number of the coefficient matrix.**\nAn orthogonal change of basis in the unknowns has the form $x = Ty$, where $T$ is an orthogonal matrix ($T^\\top T = I$). The new coefficient matrix is $\\tilde{A}_2 = A_2 T$.\nThe $2$-norm of $\\tilde{A}_2$ is $\\|\\tilde{A}_2\\|_2 = \\|A_2 T\\|_2$. Since the $2$-norm is invariant under right-multiplication by an orthogonal matrix, $\\|A_2 T\\|_2 = \\|A_2\\|_2$.\nThe inverse is $\\tilde{A}_2^{-1} = (A_2 T)^{-1} = T^{-1} A_2^{-1} = T^\\top A_2^{-1}$. The norm is $\\|\\tilde{A}_2^{-1}\\|_2 = \\|T^\\top A_2^{-1}\\|_2$. The $2$-norm is also invariant under left-multiplication by an orthogonal matrix, so $\\|T^\\top A_2^{-1}\\|_2 = \\|A_2^{-1}\\|_2$.\nTherefore, the condition number of the transformed matrix is:\n$$ \\kappa_2(\\tilde{A}_2) = \\|\\tilde{A}_2\\|_2 \\|\\tilde{A}_2^{-1}\\|_2 = \\|A_2\\|_2 \\|A_2^{-1}\\|_2 = \\kappa_2(A_2) $$\nAn orthogonal change of basis does not change the $2$-norm condition number at all. Thus, it cannot reduce it.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. In $\\mathrm{S2}$, there exists a nonsingular change of basis in the unknowns that makes the coefficient matrix have $\\kappa_2 = \\mathcal{O}(1)$, and this would imply the original mapping $b \\mapsto x$ becomes well-conditioned in the Euclidean norm.**\nThe first part of the statement is true. For any nonsingular matrix $A$, one can choose the change of basis $x=Ty$ with $T=A^{-1}$. The new system matrix becomes $AT = A A^{-1} = I$. The identity matrix $I$ has $\\kappa_2(I)=1$, which is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\nThe second part claims this implies the original mapping $b \\mapsto x$ becomes well-conditioned. This is a fundamental misunderstanding. The mapping $b \\mapsto x$ is uniquely defined by the operator $A_2^{-1}$, as $x = A_2^{-1} b$. The sensitivity of this mapping to perturbations in $b$ is measured by $\\kappa_2(A_2)$, which we found to be large ($\\approx 4 \\times 10^8$). This high sensitivity is an intrinsic property of the problem $A_2 x = b$. A change of variables is a computational technique (a preconditioner) to find the solution $x$ more accurately in the presence of floating-point arithmetic errors. It makes the system for the *new* variable $y$ well-conditioned, but it does not change the conditioning of the original problem itself. The original mapping remains ill-conditioned. The statement's implication is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In $\\mathrm{S1}$, even if one finds a change of variables that makes the transformed coefficient matrix perfectly conditioned, the sensitivity of the original solution $x$ to perturbations in $b$ measured in relative Euclidean norms remains proportional to $\\kappa_2(A_1)$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the concept discussed in C. The sensitivity of the solution $x$ to perturbations $\\delta b$ in the data $b$ for the system $A_1 x = b$ is fundamentally governed by the condition number of $A_1$. The classical error bound is:\n$$ \\frac{\\|\\delta x\\|_2}{\\|x\\|_2} \\leq \\kappa_2(A_1) \\frac{\\|\\delta b\\|_2}{\\|b\\|_2} $$\nThis inequality shows that the relative error in the solution can be as large as $\\kappa_2(A_1)$ times the relative error in the data. This property is inherent to the matrix $A_1$ and the mapping $A_1^{-1}$ that it defines. As we showed in A, we can find a change of variables that makes the transformed system matrix perfectly conditioned, which aids in the numerical computation of the solution. However, this does not alter the underlying sensitivity of the original variables $x$ to the input data $b$. That sensitivity is, and always will be, dictated by $\\kappa_2(A_1) = 10^{12}$. The statement is therefore correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. In $\\mathrm{S2}$, $\\kappa_2(A_2) \\approx 4/\\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon$, reflecting an inherent near-rank-one structure that cannot be eliminated by any unit-preserving (orthogonal) change of basis.**\nOur analysis of System $\\mathrm{S2}$ showed that for small $\\epsilon$, $\\kappa_2(A_2) = \\lambda_{\\max}/\\lambda_{\\min} \\approx 2/(\\epsilon/2) = 4/\\epsilon$. The first part of the statement is correct.\nThe reason for this large condition number is that for $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the matrix $A_2$ approaches $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, which is a rank-1 (and thus singular) matrix. This property is what is meant by \"inherent near-rank-one structure\" or more accurately, near-rank-deficiency.\nThe final clause states this cannot be eliminated by a \"unit-preserving (orthogonal) change of basis\". As proven in the analysis for option B, an orthogonal transformation preserves the $2$-norm and thus the $2$-norm condition number. The large condition number of $A_2$ is a consequence of its singular value spectrum $(\\sigma_{\\max} \\approx 2, \\sigma_{\\min} \\approx \\epsilon/2)$, which is invariant under orthogonal transformations. This type of ill-conditioning is intrinsic to the operator $A_2$ and cannot be removed by simply rotating the coordinate system.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2400703"}, {"introduction": "In practical computational engineering, we often face large, ill-conditioned systems that must be solved with iterative methods.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method is an iterative algorithm for solving the linear system of equations $Ax=b$. It is particularly effective for non-symmetric matrices $A$. The core principle of GMRES is to find an approximate solution $x_k$ at iteration $k$ from an affine subspace $x_0 + \\mathcal{K}_k(A, r_0)$ that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\|r_k\\|_2 = \\|b-Ax_k\\|_2$. Here, $x_0$ is an initial guess and $\\mathcal{K}_k(A, r_0)$ is the $k$-th order Krylov subspace generated by $A$ and the initial residual $r_0 = b-Ax_0$.\n\nThe minimization is performed over an expanding subspace. A key component of GMRES is the Arnoldi iteration, which generates an orthonormal basis $V_{k+1} = [v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{k+1}]$ for the Krylov subspace $\\mathcal{K}_{k+1}(A, r_0)$. The first vector is $v_1 = r_0 / \\|r_0\\|_2$. The Arnoldi process yields the matrix relation $AV_k = V_{k+1}\\tilde{H}_k$, where $\\tilde{H}_k$ is a $(k+1) \\times k$ upper Hessenberg matrix.\n\nAn iterate $x_k$ can be written as $x_k = x_0 + z_k$ where $z_k \\in \\mathcal{K}_k(A, r_0)$. Since $V_k$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{K}_k(A, r_0)$, we can write $z_k = V_k y$ for some vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$. The minimization problem becomes:\n$$ \\min_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^k} \\| b - A(x_0 + V_k y) \\|_2 = \\min_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^k} \\| r_0 - AV_k y \\|_2 $$\nUsing $r_0 = \\|r_0\\|_2 v_1 = \\beta v_1$ and the Arnoldi relation, we substitute to obtain:\n$$ \\min_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^k} \\| \\beta v_1 - V_{k+1} \\tilde{H}_k y \\|_2 $$\nSince the columns of $V_{k+1}$ are orthonormal, this is equivalent to solving a small least-squares problem:\n$$ \\min_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^k} \\| \\beta e_1 - \\tilde{H}_k y \\|_2 $$\nwhere $e_1$ is the first standard basis vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$. This subproblem is efficiently solved, for example, using QR factorization of $\\tilde{H}_k$. Once $y$ is found, the solution is $x_k = x_0 + V_k y$.\n\nFor the preconditioned case, we solve the left-preconditioned system $M^{-1}Ax = M^{-1}b$, where $M = \\mathrm{diag}(A)$ is the Jacobi preconditioner. GMRES is applied to the operator $A' = M^{-1}A$ and the right-hand side $b' = M^{-1}b$. The Krylov subspace is now $\\mathcal{K}_k(M^{-1}A, M^{-1}r_0)$. The algorithm minimizes the norm of the preconditioned residual, $\\|r'_k\\|_2 = \\|M^{-1}(b-Ax_k)\\|_2$.\n\nA critical detail in the problem statement is that the convergence criterion for the preconditioned case is based on the **true** relative residual, $\\rho_k^{(M)} = \\|b - Ax_k^{(M)}\\|_2 / \\|b\\|_2$, not the preconditioned one. This requires explicitly computing the iterate $x_k^{(M)}$ and the true residual at each step to check for convergence, rather than using the computationally cheaper residual norm from the least-squares subproblem.\n\nThe implementation will follow this logic. For each iteration $k$ from $1$ to $K$, we will:\n1.  Extend the Arnoldi factorization to obtain $V_{k+1}$ and $\\tilde{H}_k$.\n2.  Solve the $(k+1) \\times k$ least-squares problem for $y$.\n3.  Construct the solution $x_k = x_0 + V_k y$.\n4.  Compute the true relative residual $\\|b - Ax_k\\|_2 / \\|b\\|_2$.\n5.  If the residual is below the tolerance $\\tau$, we record the iteration count $k$ and the final residual, then terminate.\n6.  If the loop completes without convergence, we record $-1$ for the iteration count and the residual at iteration $K$.\n\nThe three test cases explore different sources of ill-conditioning:\n- **Case A**: A Hilbert matrix, which is intrinsically ill-conditioned due to nearly collinear column vectors. Its condition number grows exponentially with size.\n- **Case B**: A badly scaled matrix. The diagonal entries span many orders of magnitude. Jacobi preconditioning is specifically designed to counteract this by scaling the rows of the system.\n- **Case C**: A diagonal matrix with a small number of distinct eigenvalues. For such a matrix, GMRES is guaranteed to find the exact solution in a number of iterations equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of $A$ with respect to $r_0$, which is at most the number of distinct eigenvalues. With preconditioning by $M=A$, the system operator becomes the identity matrix, for which GMRES converges in a single iteration.", "answer": "[[ -1, 12, 2.805e-06, 1.636e-09 ],[ -1, 2, 9.999e-01, 8.748e-16 ],[ 3, 1, 1.110e-15, 8.848e-16 ]]", "id": "2400723"}]}
