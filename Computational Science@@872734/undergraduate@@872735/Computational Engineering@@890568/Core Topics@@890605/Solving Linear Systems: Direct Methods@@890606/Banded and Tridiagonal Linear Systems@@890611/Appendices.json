This first practice challenges you to generalize your understanding by implementing a solver for matrices with any lower bandwidth $p$ and upper bandwidth $q$ [@problem_id:2373172]. Developing an LU factorization that operates only within these bands is key to creating an efficient and memory-conscious algorithm for a wide array of scientific computations.", "problem": "You are asked to write a complete and runnable program that implements a solver for banded linear systems using Lower-Upper (LU) factorization without pivoting for non-centered bands. A square matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is called banded with lower bandwidth $p$ and upper bandwidth $q$ if $A_{i,j} = 0$ whenever $j  i - p$ or $j  i + q$. In other words, the nonzero pattern is confined to $p$ subdiagonals below the main diagonal and $q$ superdiagonals above it. The goal is to solve $A x = b$ by exploiting the band structure to restrict operations to the band.\n\nStarting from the definition of Gaussian elimination and the notion of LU factorization $A = L U$ with a unit lower triangular matrix $L$ (diagonal entries equal to $1$) and an upper triangular matrix $U$, derive an algorithm that:\n- Performs elimination steps only within the band implied by $p$ and $q$, assuming no pivoting is needed.\n- Stores multipliers below the diagonal as entries of $L$ and the transformed upper part as entries of $U$.\n- Uses forward substitution to solve $L y = b$ followed by backward substitution to solve $U x = y$.\n\nYour implementation must not rely on any library routine that directly solves banded systems; instead, it must implement the LU factorization and triangular solves explicitly, using only the bandwidth parameters $p$ and $q$ to limit the operations.\n\n### Test Suite\nYour program must apply the solver to the following five test cases. In each case, construct $A$, $x_{\\text{true}}$, and $b = A x_{\\text{true}}$ exactly as specified, then compute the numerical solution $\\hat{x}$ using your banded LU solver, and report the infinity norm of the error $\\lVert \\hat{x} - x_{\\text{true}} \\rVert_{\\infty} = \\max_i | \\hat{x}_i - (x_{\\text{true}})_i |$ as a floating-point number.\n\n- Case $1$ (general non-centered band): $n=7$, $p=2$, $q=1$.

It asks for the derivation and implementation of a solver for a linear system $A x = b$, where $A$ is a banded matrix, using LU factorization without pivoting. All components required for a unique solution are provided: the definition of a banded matrix, the required method, and a set of five distinct, numerically specified test cases. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and complete. There are no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to solve the linear system $A x = b$ for a square matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ with lower bandwidth $p$ and upper bandwidth $q$. This means $A_{i,j} = 0$ if $j  i - p$ or $j  i + q$. The solution method is LU factorization, decomposing $A$ into a product of a unit lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$, such that $A = LU$. The system is then solved by a two-step process: first solving $L y = b$ (forward substitution) and then $U x = y$ (backward substitution).\n\nA critical observation is that if no row permutations (pivoting) are performed, the band structure is preserved during Gaussian elimination. The resulting matrix $L$ will have a lower bandwidth of $p$, and $U$ will have an upper bandwidth of $q$. This allows for significant computational and storage savings.\n\nTo exploit the band structure, we avoid storing the full $n \\times n$ matrix $A$. Instead, we store only the non-zero bands in a compact matrix, denoted as $A_{band}$, of size $(p+q+1) \\times n$. An element $A_{i,j}$ from the original matrix is mapped to an element in the compact storage. A standard convention, which we adopt here, maps $A_{i,j}$ to the element $A_{band}[i-j+q, j]$ (using $0$-based indexing). In this scheme, the main diagonal of $A$ resides in row $q$ of $A_{band}$, the $q$ superdiagonals are in rows $0, \\dots, q-1$, and the $p$ subdiagonals are in rows $q+1, \\dots, q+p$.\n\nThe LU factorization process is an in-place modification of the $A_{band}$ matrix. The algorithm is derived from standard Gaussian elimination. The process iterates through columns $k$ from $0$ to $n-2$, using the pivot $A_{k,k}$ to eliminate the non-zero entries below it in the same column.\n\nFor each pivot column $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-2\\}$:\nThe elements to be eliminated are $A_{i,k}$ for rows $i$ where $k+1 \\le i \\le \\min(n-1, k+p)$.\nFor each such row $i$, the multiplier is calculated as $m_{i,k} = A_{i,k} / A_{k,k}$.\nThis multiplier $m_{i,k}$ becomes the entry $L_{i,k}$ of the matrix $L$. We store it in the position previously occupied by $A_{i,k}$.\nThe elimination update rule is $A_{i,j} \\leftarrow A_{i,j} - m_{i,k} A_{k,j}$. This update only needs to be applied to columns $j$ where both $A_{i,j}$ and $A_{k,j}$ can be non-zero. This corresponds to columns $j \\in \\{k+1, \\dots, \\min(n-1, k+q)\\}$.\n\nIn terms of the compact storage $A_{band}$, the factorization algorithm is as follows for $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-2\\}$:\n1. For each row index $i \\in \\{k+1, \\dots, \\min(n-1, k+p)\\}$:\n   a. The pivot is $U_{k,k} = A_{band}[q, k]$.\n   b. The element to be eliminated is $A_{i,k}$, located at $A_{band}[i-k+q, k]$.\n   c. Calculate the multiplier $m_{i,k} = \\frac{A_{band}[i-k+q, k]}{A_{band}[q, k]}$.\n   d. Store this multiplier in place: $A_{band}[i-k+q, k] = m_{i,k}$. This entry now represents $L_{i,k}$.\n   e. For each column index $j \\in \\{k+1, \\dots, \\min(n-1, k+q)\\}$, update the corresponding element of row $i$:\n      $$ A_{band}[i-j+q, j] \\leftarrow A_{band}[i-j+q, j] - m_{i,k} \\times A_{band}[k-j+q, j] $$\nAfter this process completes, the upper part of $A_{band}$ (rows $0$ to $q$) contains the matrix $U$, and the strictly lower part (rows $q+1$ to $q+p$) contains the non-diagonal entries of $L$.\n\nWith the factorization $A=LU$ completed in-place, we proceed to solve the two triangular systems.\n\nFirst, forward substitution to solve $L y = b$:\nSince $L$ is a unit lower triangular matrix with lower bandwidth $p$, the formula for each component $y_i$ is:\n$$ y_i = b_i - \\sum_{j=\\max(0, i-p)}^{i-1} L_{i,j} y_j \\quad \\text{for } i = 0, \\dots, n-1 $$\nThe entries $L_{i,j}$ are the multipliers stored in $A_{band}[i-j+q, j]$. The vector $y$ can be computed by iterating $i$ from $0$ to $n-1$.\n\nSecond, backward substitution to solve $U x = y$:\nSince $U$ is an upper triangular matrix with upper bandwidth $q$, we solve for $x$ by iterating backwards from $i = n-1$ down to $0$:\n$$ x_i = \\frac{1}{U_{i,i}} \\left( y_i - \\sum_{j=i+1}^{\\min(n-1, i+q)} U_{i,j} x_j \\right) \\quad \\text{for } i = n-1, \\dots, 0 $$\nThe entries $U_{i,j}$ are stored in $A_{band}[i-j+q, j]$. The diagonal entry $U_{i,i}$ is at $A_{band}[q, i]$.\n\nThis completes the derivation of the algorithm. A program implementing these steps will be constructed to solve the given test cases. For each case, the matrix $A$ and vector $x_{\\text{true}}$ are defined, $b = A x_{\\text{true}}$ is computed, the numerical solution $\\hat{x}$ is found using the derived banded LU solver, and the infinity norm of the error, $\\lVert \\hat{x} - x_{\\text{true}} \\rVert_{\\infty}$, is reported.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef full_to_banded(A, p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a full numpy matrix A to its compact banded representation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = A.shape[0]\n    A_band = np.zeros((p + q + 1, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(max(0, i - p), min(n, i + q + 1)):\n            # Mapping A[i, j] to A_band[row, col]\n            # row = i - j + q, col = j\n            A_band[i - j + q, j] = A[i, j]\n    return A_band\n\ndef banded_lu_factorization(A_band, p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs LU factorization in-place on a banded matrix.\n    The upper part of A_band will store U, the lower part will store L.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = A_band.shape[1]\n    # k is the pivot column (0-indexed)\n    for k in range(n - 1):\n        # Pivot element U_kk is at A_band[q, k]\n        pivot = A_band[q, k]\n        if pivot == 0:\n            # This would require pivoting, which is not implemented as per problem spec.\n            # For the given test cases, this should not occur.\n            raise ValueError(\"Zero pivot encountered.\")\n        \n        # i is the row to be updated\n        for i in range(k + 1, min(n, k + p + 1)):\n            # Multiplier L_ik = A_ik / U_kk\n            # Element A_ik is at A_band[i-k+q, k]\n            multiplier = A_band[i - k + q, k] / pivot\n            A_band[i - k + q, k] = multiplier  # Store L_ik\n\n            # Update row i from column k+1 to k+q\n            # A_ij - A_ij - L_ik * U_kj\n            for j in range(k + 1, min(n, k + q + 1)):\n                # U_kj is at A_band[k-j+q, j]\n                # A_ij is at A_band[i-j+q, j]\n                A_band[i - j + q, j] -= multiplier * A_band[k - j + q, j]\n\ndef solve_banded_lu(A_band, p, q, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves A x = b for a banded system A, given its in-place LU factorization A_band.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = A_band.shape[1]\n    y = b.copy()\n\n    # Forward substitution to solve L y = b\n    # L is unit lower triangular with lower bandwidth p\n    for i in range(n):\n        s = 0.0\n        # Sum over L_ij * y_j\n        for j in range(max(0, i - p), i):\n            # L_ij is at A_band[i-j+q, j]\n            s += A_band[i - j + q, j] * y[j]\n        y[i] -= s\n\n    # Backward substitution to solve U x = y\n    # U is upper triangular with upper bandwidth q\n    x = y.copy()\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        s = 0.0\n        # Sum over U_ij * x_j\n        for j in range(i + 1, min(n, i + q + 1)):\n            # U_ij is at A_band[i-j+q, j]\n            s += A_band[i - j + q, j] * x[j]\n        \n        # U_ii is at A_band[q, i]\n        x[i] = (y[i] - s) / A_band[q, i]\n        \n    return x\n\ndef get_test_cases():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the five test cases as specified in the problem.\n    Returns a list of tuples, each containing (A, p, q, x_true).\n    \"\"\"\n    cases = []\n\n    # Case 1\n    n1, p1, q1 = 7, 2, 1\n    A1 = np.zeros((n1, n1))\n    for i in range(n1):\n        A1[i, i] = 5.0 + (i + 1)\n        if i + 1  n1: A1[i, i + 1] = -1.0\n        if i - 1 = 0: A1[i, i - 1] = -2.0\n        if i - 2 = 0: A1[i, i - 2] = 0.5\n    x_true1 = np.array([1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0, 5.0, -6.0, 7.0])\n    cases.append((A1, p1, q1, x_true1))\n\n    # Case 2\n    n2, p2, q2 = 6, 1, 1\n    A2 = np.zeros((n2, n2))\n    for i in range(n2):\n        A2[i, i] = 4.0\n        if i + 1  n2: A2[i, i + 1] = -1.0\n        if i - 1 = 0: A2[i, i - 1] = -1.0\n    x_true2 = np.ones(n2)\n    cases.append((A2, p2, q2, x_true2))\n\n    # Case 3\n    n3, p3, q3 = 5, 0, 3\n    A3 = np.zeros((n3, n3))\n    for i in range(n3):\n        A3[i, i] = 4.0 + (i + 1)\n        if i + 1  n3: A3[i, i + 1] = 0.5\n        if i + 2  n3: A3[i, i + 2] = -0.25\n        if i + 3  n3: A3[i, i + 3] = 0.125\n    x_true3 = np.array([2.0, -1.0, 0.5, -0.5, 1.0])\n    cases.append((A3, p3, q3, x_true3))\n\n    # Case 4\n    n4, p4, q4 = 5, 2, 0\n    A4 = np.zeros((n4, n4))\n    for i in range(n4):\n        A4[i, i] = 5.0\n        if i - 1 = 0: A4[i, i - 1] = -1.0\n        if i - 2 = 0: A4[i, i - 2] = 0.3\n    x_true4 = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])\n    cases.append((A4, p4, q4, x_true4))\n\n    # Case 5\n    n5, p5, q5 = 6, 0, 0\n    A5 = np.zeros((n5, n5))\n    for i in range(n5):\n        A5[i, i] = 2.0 + 0.1 * (i + 1)\n    x_true5 = np.array([-1.0, 2.0, -3.0, 4.0, -5.0, 6.0])\n    cases.append((A5, p5, q5, x_true5))\n\n    return cases\n\ndef solve():\n    test_cases = get_test_cases()\n    results = []\n\n    for A_full, p, q, x_true in test_cases:\n        # 1.

The second derivative $y''(x)$ at an interior grid point $x_i$ is approximated using a second-order accurate central difference formula:\n$$\ny''(x_i) \\approx \\frac{y(x_{i-1}) - 2y(x_i) + y(x_{i+1})}{h^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the Airy equation for each interior point $x_i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, we obtain a system of $n$ linear equations:\n$$\n\\frac{y_{i-1} - 2y_i + y_{i+1}}{h^2} - x_i y_i = 0.\n$$\nRearranging this equation to group the unknown terms ($y_1, \\dots, y_n$) on the left-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{h^2} y_{i-1} + \\left(-\\frac{2}{h^2} - x_i\\right) y_i + \\frac{1}{h^2} y_{i+1} = 0.\n$$\nThis set of equations for $i = 1, \\dots, n$ forms a linear system of the form $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{d}$, where $\\mathbf{u} = (y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n)^\\top$ is the vector of unknown interior values.\n\nFor the first equation ($i=1$), the term $y_0$ is known ($\\alpha$), so it is moved to the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{2}{h^2} - x_1\\right) y_1 + \\frac{1}{h^2} y_2 = -\\frac{1}{h^2} y_0 = -\\frac{\\alpha}{h^2}.\n$$\nFor the last equation ($i=n$), the term $y_{n+1}$ is known ($\\beta$), and is also moved to the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{h^2} y_{n-1} + \\left(-\\frac{2}{h^2} - x_n\\right) y_n = -\\frac{1}{h^2} y_{n+1} = -\\frac{\\beta}{h^2}.\n$$\nFor any other interior equation where $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n-1\\}$, the right-hand side is $0$.\n\nThe coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is thus tridiagonal, with the following structure:\n- Main diagonal entries: $A_{i,i} = -2/h^2 - x_i$\n- Sub-diagonal and super-diagonal entries: $A_{i, i+1} = A_{i+1, i} = 1/h^2$\n\nThe right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{d} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by:\n$$\nd_i = \\begin{cases}\n    -\\alpha/h^2  \\text{if } i = 1, \\\\\n    0  \\text{if } 1  i  n, \\\\\n    -\\beta/h^2  \\text{if } i = n \\text{ and } n  1, \\\\\n    -(\\alpha+\\beta)/h^2  \\text{if } i = 1 \\text{ and } n = 1.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis structure is efficiently solved using specialized algorithms for banded matrices, such as those available in the SciPy library.\n\nTo compute the error, we need the exact solution. The general solution to the Airy equation is $y(x) = c_1 \\operatorname{Ai}(x) + c_2 \\operatorname{Bi}(x)$. The constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions. For all test cases, the boundary values are set to $\\alpha = \\operatorname{Ai}(x_{\\mathrm{L}})$ and $\\beta = \\operatorname{Ai}(x_{\\mathrm{R}})$. The boundary conditions thus become:\n$$\nc_1 \\operatorname{Ai}(x_{\\mathrm{L}}) + c_2 \\operatorname{Bi}(x_{\\mathrm{L}}) = \\operatorname{Ai}(x_{\\mathrm{L}})\n$$\n$$\nc_1 \\operatorname{Ai}(x_{\\mathrm{R}}) + c_2 \\operatorname{Bi}(x_{\\mathrm{R}}) = \\operatorname{Ai}(x_{\\mathrm{R}})\n$$\nBy inspection, the unique solution to this system is $c_1=1$ and $c_2=0$, because the Airy functions $\\operatorname{Ai}(x)$ and $\\operatorname{Bi}(x)$ form a fundamental set of solutions. Therefore, the exact solution for all test cases is simply $y(x) = \\operatorname{Ai}(x)$.\n\nThe numerical procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Define the parameters $x_{\\mathrm{L}}$, $x_{\\mathrm{R}}$, and $n$.\n2.  Calculate the grid spacing $h$, the interior grid points $x_i$, and the boundary values $\\alpha = \\operatorname{Ai}(x_{\\mathrm{L}})$ and $\\beta = \\operatorname{Ai}(x_{\\mathrm{R}})$.\n3.  Construct the tridiagonal matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ in a banded format and the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{d}$.\n4.  Solve the linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{d}$ to find the vector of numerical approximations $\\mathbf{u} = (y_1, \\dots, y_n)^\\top$.\n5.  Form the complete numerical solution vector $(y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_n, y_{n+1}) = (\\alpha, u_1, \\dots, u_n, \\beta)$.\n6.  Evaluate the exact solution $y(x_j) = \\operatorname{Ai}(x_j)$ at all grid points $x_j$, for $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, n+1\\}$.\n7.  Compute the maximum absolute error $E_{\\infty} = \\max_{0 \\le j \\le n+1} |y_j - y(x_j)|$. Since the errors at the boundaries are zero by construction, this simplifies to calculating the maximum error over the interior points.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the four specified test cases to obtain the required error values.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import airy\nfrom scipy.linalg import solve_banded\n\ndef solve_airy_bvp(x_L: float, x_R: float, n: int) - float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Airy BVP using finite differences and returns the max grid error.\n\n    Args:\n        x_L (float): Left boundary of the interval.\n        x_R (float): Right boundary of the interval.\n        n (int): Number of interior grid points.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The maximum absolute error E_infinity.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n  0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of interior points n must be non-negative.\")\n\n    # 1.

The matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ has non-zero entries only on its main diagonal ($b_i$), subdiagonal ($a_i$), and superdiagonal ($c_i$). A critical requirement is that the chosen solution method must be a robust direct method, capable of handling cases where diagonal elements $b_i$ are zero, a condition under which the standard Thomas algorithm fails.\n\nFirst, the given problem is validated. The problem statement is scientifically grounded in numerical linear algebra, a core component of computational science. It is well-posed, as each test case corresponds to a non-singular linear system, guaranteeing a unique solution. The definitions are objective and unambiguous, and all necessary information to reproduce the test cases is provided. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nA standard direct method for tridiagonal systems is the Thomas algorithm, which is a specialized form of Gaussian elimination. The algorithm consists of a forward elimination pass followed by a backward substitution pass. In the forward pass, the system is transformed into an upper bidiagonal one. For the $i$-th equation, $a_i x_{i-1} + b_i x_i + c_i x_{i+1} = d_i$, this is achieved by eliminating $x_{i-1}$. This leads to recurrence relations for modified coefficients. For example, one common formulation modifies the diagonal and right-hand side as follows:\n$$ b'_1 = b_1, \\quad d'_1 = d_1 $$\nFor $i = 2, \\dots, n$:\n$$ m_i = \\frac{a_i}{b'_{i-1}} $$\n$$ b'_i = b_i - m_i c_{i-1} $$\n$$ d'_i = d_i - m_i d'_{i-1} $$\nThe system is then solved by backward substitution:\n$$ x_n = \\frac{d'_n}{b'_n} $$\n$$ x_i = \\frac{d'_i - c_i x_{i+1}}{b'_i} \\quad \\text{for } i = n-1, \\dots, 1 $$\nThis algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. However, its critical flaw is the division by the pivot element $b'_{i-1}$ at each step. If any $b'_{i-1}$ is zero or numerically close to zero, the algorithm fails or becomes numerically unstable. This is precisely the issue highlighted by Test Case 2, where $b_1 = 0$, and Test Case 3, where $b_1 = 10^{-16}$.\n\nTo address this deficiency, a robust direct method is required. The canonical choice for such problems is Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting (GEPP). The principle of GEPP is to mitigate numerical instability by ensuring the pivot element is as large as possible in magnitude. At each step $j$ of the elimination, the algorithm inspects all entries in the current column $j$ from row $j$ downwards. It then swaps the current row $j$ with the row containing the entry of largest absolute value (the pivot).\n\nFor a tridiagonal matrix, the pivoting step at column $j$ is simplified. The only potentially non-zero entries at or below the diagonal in column $j$ are $A_{j,j}$ (which is $b_j$) and $A_{j+1,j}$ (which is $a_{j+1}$). Therefore, partial pivoting only requires comparing $|A_{j,j}|$ with $|A_{j+1,j}|$ and swapping row $j$ with row $j+1$ if the latter is larger. Such a swap may introduce a non-zero element outside the tridiagonal structure (a \"fill-in\"), specifically at position $(j, j+2)$ if row $j$ is swapped with row $j+1$. The resulting matrix becomes upper triangular with an upper bandwidth of $2$.\n\nThe GEPP algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Forward Elimination with Partial Pivoting**: For each column $j$ from $1$ to $n-1$:\n    a.  **Pivoting**: Find the row index $p \\ge j$ such that $|A_{p,j}|$ is maximized. For an initially tridiagonal system, $p$ will be either $j$ or $j+1$. Swap row $j$ and row $p$. Also swap the corresponding elements in the vector $\\mathbf{d}$.\n    b.  **Elimination**: For each row $i$ from $j+1$ to $n$, calculate the multiplier $m = A_{i,j} / A_{j,j}$. Update row $i$ by subtracting $m$ times the pivot row $j$: $R_i \\leftarrow R_i - m R_j$. This operation zeros out the element $A_{i,j}$. The same operation is applied to the right-hand side vector: $d_i \\leftarrow d_i - m d_j$. For an initially tridiagonal system, only row $j+1$ will have a non-zero $A_{j+1,j}$ to be eliminated at step $j$.\n\n2.  **Backward Substitution**: After the forward elimination process, the matrix $A$ is converted into an upper triangular matrix $U$. The system $U \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{d'}$ is then solved for $\\mathbf{x}$ starting from the last variable $x_n$ and proceeding backwards to $x_1$:\n    $$ x_n = \\frac{d'_n}{U_{n,n}} $$\n    $$ x_i = \\frac{1}{U_{i,i}} \\left( d'_i - \\sum_{k=i+1}^{n} U_{i,k} x_k \\right) \\quad \\text{for } i = n-1, \\dots, 1 $$\nThis algorithm is robust against zero diagonal elements (provided the matrix is non-singular) and is numerically stable. For the small problem sizes specified ($n \\le 6$), implementing this algorithm using a dense matrix representation for $A$ is straightforward and computationally acceptable, avoiding the complexities of managing a banded matrix structure with fill-in.
