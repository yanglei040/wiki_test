It correctly proposes using an alchemical thermodynamic cycle (TI or FEP) to directly compute $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$. It specifies an explicit solvent model with salt, which is essential for accurately modeling the electrostatic effects of the charge-changing mutation and matching experimental conditions. Crucially, it proposes using Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD), the most physically accurate method to model the system at a fixed $pH$, allowing the protonation state of titratable residues to be determined by the environment. Finally, by performing simulations at multiple temperatures, it allows for the calculation of enthalpic and entropic components, providing the most robust way to predict the shift in $T_m$. This protocol addresses every requirement of the problem with the highest level of theoretical rigor.\n\n**B.** This protocol is physically unsound. Vacuum simulations are wholly inappropriate for studying protein folding, which is dominated by solvent interactions. Furthermore, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is a measure of structural drift, not thermodynamic stability ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$), and does not provide a quantitative result.\n\n**C.** This protocol is baseless. The primary interaction for a negative charge would be with cations (Na$^+$), not anions (Cl$^-$). More importantly, simply counting bound ions is not a measure of overall thermodynamic stability and ignores all other contributions to the free energy.\n\n**D.** This protocol is a gross oversimplification. A surface-area-based model ($\\Delta G \\approx \\gamma \\Delta A$) accounts for the hydrophobic effect but completely ignores the dominant electrostatic changes of the D$35$N mutation. It also neglects the effect of the mutation on the unfolded state and all specified experimental conditions.\n\n**E.** This protocol describes a valid but less accurate and less efficient approach than A. Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) can compute a melting curve, but it is extremely computationally expensive. The use of an implicit solvent model is a major limitation, as it is less accurate for specific ion effects and detailed electrostatics than an explicit model. Likewise, fixing protonation states is less rigorous than the dynamic sampling provided by CpHMD.
