The description of the algorithm, including the importance-sampled propagator, the role of the trial wavefunction, the local energy, the branching factor, and the fixed-node approximation, is entirely consistent with established theory and practice. The question posed concerns the consequences of varying a critical simulation parameter, $\\Delta\\tau$, which is a fundamental aspect of analyzing the performance of any such stochastic algorithm. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the DMC algorithm is the iterative application of a short-time approximation to the imaginary-time propagator, $e^{-\\Delta\\tau\\hat{H}}$. For importance-sampled DMC, we consider the propagation of the distribution $f(\\mathbf{R}, \\tau) = \\Psi_T(\\mathbf{R})\\Phi(\\mathbf{R}, \\tau)$, where $\\Psi_T$ is the trial wavefunction and $\\Phi$ is the ground-state wavefunction. The evolution of $f$ is governed by an operator that can be split into drift, diffusion, and branching terms. This splitting is an approximation, typically via the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, and is only accurate for small $\\Delta\\tau$. The error incurred from this approximation is known as the **time-step bias**.\n\nLet us analyze the two aspects of the question: ground-state energy and population stability.\n\n**1. Effect on Ground-State Energy**\n\nThe use of a finite time step $\\Delta\\tau$ introduces a systematic error in the calculation. The operator exponential $\\exp[-\\Delta\\tau(\\hat{H})]$ is typically approximated as a product of exponentials of the kinetic operator $\\hat{T}$ and potential operator $\\hat{V}$, for example, $\\exp(-\\Delta\\tau\\hat{H}) \\approx \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta\\tau\\hat{V})\\exp(-\\Delta\\tau\\hat{T})\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta\\tau\\hat{V})$. The error in this symmetric Trotter decomposition is of the order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta\\tau^3)$ for one step, leading to a total energy bias of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta\\tau^2)$. For the simpler asymmetric split, the bias is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta\\tau)$.\n\nRegardless of the specific order, the error is a direct function of $\\Delta\\tau$. A \"very large\" $\\Delta\\tau$ makes the fundamental short-time approximation upon which the entire algorithm rests invalid. The error terms, which are negligible for small $\\Delta\\tau$, become dominant. Consequently, the calculated energy, $E(\\Delta\\tau)$, will deviate significantly from the true fixed-node energy, $E_{\\mathrm{FN}} = \\lim_{\\Delta\\tau \\to 0} E(\\Delta\\tau)$. Therefore, a large $\\Delta\\tau$ results in a **larger systematic time-step bias**.\n\n**2. Effect on Walker Population Stability**\n\nThe population of walkers is controlled by the branching factor $w = \\exp[-\\Delta\\tau(E_{\\mathrm{L}} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})]$. The local energy, $E_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\hat{H}\\Psi_T(\\mathbf{R})/\\Psi_T(\\mathbf{R})$, is not constant for a non-exact trial wavefunction $\\Psi_T$. It fluctuates as walkers sample different regions of configuration space $\\mathbf{R}$. The reference energy $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is dynamically adjusted to be near the average ground-state energy, so that on average $\\langle w \\rangle \\approx 1$.\n\nConsider the argument of the exponential, $-\\Delta\\tau(E_{\\mathrm{L}} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})$. The term $(E_{\\mathrm{L}} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})$ represents the fluctuation of the local energy around the target energy. When $\\Delta\\tau$ is large, this argument can take on very large positive or negative values.\n- If a walker moves to a region where $E_{\\mathrm{L}} \\ll E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, the weight $w$ becomes exponentially large, causing a massive creation of descendant walkers (a population explosion from one walker).\n- If a walker moves to a region where $E_{\\mathrm{L}} \\gg E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ (e.g., near a node of $\\Psi_T$), the weight $w$ becomes exponentially small, effectively killing the walker.\n\nA large $\\Delta\\tau$ dramatically amplifies the effect of local energy fluctuations on the branching weights. The variance of the weights across the population will increase enormously. This is the definition of an unstable simulation. The population will be dominated by a very small number of highly-weighted walkers, while the vast majority of walkers are eliminated. Such a simulation is statistically inefficient and prone to catastrophic failure, either through the death of all walkers (collapse) or an unmanageable increase in population (explosion). Strong population control algorithms are required to counteract this, but they can introduce their own biases. Thus, a large $\\Delta\\tau$ leads to **severe instability of the walker population**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The estimated ground-state energy exhibits a larger systematic time-step bias (deviating more from the fixed-node limit), and the walker population becomes unstable with large fluctuations, potentially exploding or collapsing unless strong population control is applied.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. A large $\\Delta\\tau$ invalidates the short-time approximation, increasing the time-step bias. It also amplifies the fluctuations in branching weights, leading to population instability.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The estimated ground-state energy becomes more accurate because faster projection reduces excited-state contamination, and the walker population becomes more stable because fewer propagation steps are needed.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The theoretical benefit of a larger projection operator $e^{-\\Delta\\tau\\hat{H}}$ is completely nullified by the catastrophic failure of its *approximation* for large $\\Delta\\tau$. The accuracy is dominated by the time-step bias, which worsens. The claim of improved population stability is also false; stability is determined by the variance of weights per step, which is severely degraded by large $\\Delta\\tau$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The estimated ground-state energy is unaffected in the infinite-walker and long-time limit, although the walker population becomes unstable; the instability does not influence the energy estimator.**\nThis is incorrect. The time-step bias is a *systematic* error, not a statistical one. It does not vanish by increasing the number of walkers or the total simulation time. The simulation converges to the wrong value, $E(\\Delta\\tau)$, not $E_{\\mathrm{FN}}$. Furthermore, severe population instability and the strong control measures needed to mitigate it can introduce additional biases into the energy estimator.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The estimated ground-state energy suffers a larger time-step bias, but the walker population becomes more stable because branching events are less frequent at larger $\\Delta\\tau$.**\nThe first part of the statement is correct. However, the second part is incorrect. The logic confuses the frequency of branching steps with the stability of the population within each step. The stability is dictated by the variance of the branching factor $w$, which, as derived, increases dramatically with $\\Delta\\tau$, causing profound instability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2454150"}, {"introduction": "The efficiency of importance-sampled DMC is profoundly influenced by the quality of the trial wavefunction, $\\Psi_T$.

A solution will be derived based on these givens.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe local energy $E_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\mathbf{R})$ is central to the DMC algorithm. Its properties determine the efficiency and stability of the simulation. Let us analyze its behavior as one electron, say electron $i$, approaches the nucleus $A$ (which we place at the origin, so $\\mathbf{r}_i \\to 0$ and $r_{iA} = r_i$). The Hamiltonian can be split into terms involving electron $i$ and other terms that remain finite as $r_i \\to 0$.\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i^2 \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}(\\mathbf{R})}{\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}(\\mathbf{R})} - \\frac{Z}{r_i} + \\left( \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j \\neq i} \\nabla_j^2 \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}} - \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{Z}{r_{jA}} + \\sum_{jk} \\frac{1}{r_{jk}} \\right)\n$$\nAs $r_i \\to 0$, the terms in the parenthesis remain finite. The behavior of $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is dominated by the kinetic energy of electron $i$ and its potential energy of attraction to the nucleus.\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\mathbf{R}) \\approx \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i^2 \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}} - \\frac{Z}{r_i} \\quad \\text{as } r_i \\to 0\n$$\n\nThe Kato cusp condition for the exact wavefunction dictates that for the singularity in the potential energy $(-Z/r_i)$ to be cancelled by the kinetic energy term, the wavefunction must have a specific non-analytic form at the nucleus. Spherically averaging the wavefunction around the nucleus, the condition is:\n$$\n\\lim_{r_i \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\Psi}(\\mathbf{R})} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{\\Psi}(\\mathbf{R})}{\\partial r_i} = -Z\n$$\nThis implies that $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$ should behave as $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}} \\approx C(1 - Z r_i + \\dots)$ or, more generally, $\\bar{\\Psi}_{\\mathrm{T}} \\sim \\exp(-Z r_i)$ for small $r_i$.\n\nLet us analyze two cases:\n\n1.  **Cusp condition is satisfied by $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$**:\n    If we assume the spherically averaged part of $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$ behaves as $\\bar{\\Psi}_{\\mathrm{T}}(r_i) \\sim \\exp(-Z r_i)$, the radial part of the Laplacian is $\\nabla_i^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r_i^2} + \\frac{2}{r_i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_i}$.\n    Applying this to $\\bar{\\Psi}_{\\mathrm{T}}$, the kinetic energy term becomes:\n    $$\n    \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i^2 \\bar{\\Psi}_{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\bar{\\Psi}_{\\mathrm{T}}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2/\\partial r_i^2 + (2/r_i)\\partial/\\partial r_i}{\\bar{\\Psi}_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\right] \\approx -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( Z^2 - \\frac{2Z}{r_i} \\right) = \\frac{Z}{r_i} - \\frac{Z^2}{2}\n    $$\n    The local energy then becomes:\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{L}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{Z}{r_i} - \\frac{Z^2}{2}\\right) - \\frac{Z}{r_i} + \\text{finite terms} = -\\frac{Z^2}{2} + \\text{finite terms}\n    $$\n    The $1/r_i$ singularities cancel, and $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$ remains finite at the nucleus. This results in a finite variance of the local energy, $\\sigma^2(E_{\\mathrm{L}})$, which is a prerequisite for an efficient and stable DMC simulation.\n\n2.  **Cusp condition is NOT satisfied by $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$**:\n    Trial wavefunctions are often built from smooth analytic functions (e.g., Gaussian basis functions). In this case, near the nucleus, $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$ can be expanded in a Taylor series, $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}} \\approx C_0 + C_1 r_i + C_2 r_i^2 + \\dots$. For a smooth function with a maximum at the origin, $C_1=0$.\n    Then, $\\frac{\\partial \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\partial r_i} \\approx 2C_2 r_i$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\partial r_i^2} \\approx 2C_2$. The kinetic energy term becomes:\n    $$\n    \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i^2 \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\approx \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(2C_2 + \\frac{2}{r_i}(2C_2 r_i))}{C_0} = \\frac{-3C_2}{C_0}\n    $$\n    This is a finite constant. The local energy then behaves as:\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{L}} \\approx \\text{finite} - \\frac{Z}{r_i}\n    $$\n    The local energy diverges to $-\\infty$ as $r_i \\to 0$. Even if the trial function has a cusp but with an incorrect slope (e.g., $\\bar{\\Psi}_{\\mathrm{T}} \\sim \\exp(-a r_i)$ with $a \\neq Z$), a similar analysis shows $E_{\\mathrm{L}} \\approx \\frac{a-Z}{r_i} + \\text{finite terms}$, which also diverges.\n\nA divergent local energy has severe practical consequences. The weight of a walker in DMC is updated at each step $\\Delta\\tau$ using a factor like $\\exp[-(E_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\mathbf{R}) - E_T)\\Delta\\tau]$. If $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$ can diverge to $+\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, walkers occasionally moving into these regions of configuration space will have their weights fluctuate wildly, becoming near zero or enormous. This leads to an unstable simulation where the population of walkers either collapses or explodes, a phenomenon known as branching instability. To mitigate this, one must use a very small time step $\\Delta\\tau$, which makes the simulation computationally prohibitive. The large variations in $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$ also greatly increase the time-step error (bias), as the short-time approximation for the Green's function propagator used in DMC is no longer accurate.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $E_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\mathbf{R})$ exhibits a $1/r$ divergence as $r_{iA}\\to 0$, producing large fluctuations in walker weights and unstable population control, which in practice amplifies time-step bias and can cause branching instabilities.**\nAs derived above, if the cusp condition is not satisfied, the cancellation between the kinetic and potential energy terms in $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is incomplete, leading to a $1/r_{iA}$ divergence. This divergence causes extreme fluctuations in the walker weights via the exponential weighting factor in the DMC algorithm. This instability is a primary source of time-step bias and can cause the simulation to become numerically unstable (branching instability). This statement accurately describes the consequences. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The fixed-node error necessarily increases because violating the cusp condition changes the nodal surface, shifting the ground-state energy upward even as the time step $\\Delta\\tau\\to 0$.**\nThe problem specifies a real, positive trial wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$. For many atomic ground states (e.g., He, Be, Ne), the exact ground state wavefunction is also nodeless. In such cases, there are no nodes, and the fixed-node error is zero by definition. The issue of cusp violation is independent of the existence of nodes. One can have a nodal wavefunction with correct cusps, or a nodeless one with incorrect cusps. The cusp condition and the nodal surface are distinct properties of the wavefunction. Therefore, violating the cusp condition does not *necessarily* change the nodal surface or increase the fixed-node error. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d = 2 \\nabla \\ln \\lvert \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}} \\rvert$ becomes infinite at nuclei when the cusp condition is violated, so walkers are deterministically expelled and the variance is reduced.**\nThe drift velocity is $\\mathbf{v}_d = 2 \\frac{\\nabla \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}}$. Let us analyze its behavior near the nucleus ($r_i \\to 0$). If $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is smooth, e.g., $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}} \\approx C_0 + C_2 r_i^2$, then $\\nabla \\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}} \\approx 2C_2 r_i \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_i$. Thus, $\\mathbf{v}_d \\approx 2 \\frac{2C_2 r_i \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_i}{C_0} \\to 0$ as $r_i \\to 0$. The drift velocity goes to zero, not infinity. If the cusp condition is satisfied correctly, $\\mathbf{v}_d$ approaches a finite value $(-2Z\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_i)$. The premise that the drift becomes infinite is false. Consequently, the conclusion that variance is reduced is also false; a diverging local energy implies an infinite variance. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Importance sampling exactly cancels the Coulomb singularity for any smooth $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$, so the mixed-estimator energy remains exact at finite time step $\\Delta\\tau0$ even without the cusp.**\nThis statement is the opposite of the truth. Importance sampling, through the kinetic energy term in $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$, cancels the Coulomb singularity *if and only if* the trial wavefunction satisfies the cusp condition. For a smooth $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{T}}$, the cancellation fails. Furthermore, the DMC energy is *never* exact at a finite time step $\\Delta\\tau>0$; there is always a time-step error that must be extrapolated to zero. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Using pseudopotentials completely eliminates all issues associated with the cusp, so there is never any consequence to violating the cusp condition in practice.**\nUsing pseudopotentials is indeed a common strategy to avoid the issues of all-electron calculations. Pseudopotentials replace the core electrons and the sharp nuclear Coulomb potential with a smoother effective potential, thus removing the cusp condition altogether. However, the problem is explicitly framed as an **all-electron** simulation. This option describes a different type of calculation and is therefore not an answer to the question asked. It describes a way to avoid the problem, not the consequence of having the problem in the specified context. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2454168"}, {"introduction": "A healthy DMC simulation maintains a diverse population of walkers sampling the configuration space.

It is well-posed, with all necessary equations, initial conditions, and parameters defined, ensuring a unique solution for each test case. The language is objective and mathematically precise. The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution\nThe problem asks for the computation of the final average energy $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}(T)$ and effective population $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T)$ for an ensemble of walkers. The core of the problem lies in determining the final weights $w_i(T)$.\n\nFirst, we find a closed-form expression for the final weight $w_i(T)$. The weight update rule is a recurrence relation:\n$$\nw_i(t+1)=w_i(t)\\exp(-\\Delta \\tau\\,(E_i-E_{\\mathrm{ref}}))\n$$\nLet the growth factor for walker $i$ be $g_i = \\exp(-\\Delta \\tau\\,(E_i-E_{\\mathrm{ref}}))$. The relation is $w_i(t+1) = w_i(t) g_i$. With the initial condition $w_i(0)=1$, we can unroll the recursion:\n$w_i(1) = w_i(0) g_i = g_i$\n$w_i(2) = w_i(1) g_i = g_i^2$\n...\nAfter $T$ steps, the final weight is:\n$$\nw_i(T) = w_i(0) g_i^T = g_i^T = \\exp(-T \\Delta \\tau\\,(E_i-E_{\\mathrm{ref}}))\n$$\nThis formula applies for any number of steps $T \\ge 0$. If $T=0$, the exponent is $0$, yielding $w_i(0)=1$, which is consistent with the initial condition.\n\nThe problem defines two scenarios based on the number of rogue walkers, $r$.\n\n**Case 1: No Rogue Walker ($r=0$)**\nIn this case, all $N$ walkers are identical. Their local energies are all equal to $E_{\\mathrm{typ}}$.\n$E_i = E_{\\mathrm{typ}}$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$.\nConsequently, their final weights are also identical:\n$$\nw_i(T) = \\exp(-T \\Delta \\tau\\,(E_{\\mathrm{typ}}-E_{\\mathrm{ref}})) = w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)\n$$\nThe sum of all weights is $\\sum_{j=1}^N w_j(T) = N w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)$. The normalized weights are:\n$$\n\\tilde{w}_i(T) = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)}{N w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)} = \\frac{1}{N}\n$$\nThe average energy is the simple arithmetic mean of the energies, which is just $E_{\\mathrm{typ}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{avg}}(T) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\tilde{w}_i(T) E_i = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{N} E_{\\mathrm{typ}} = N \\left(\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{typ}}}{N}\\right) = E_{\\mathrm{typ}}\n$$\nThe effective population is calculated as:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T) = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\tilde{w}_i(T)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{N \\cdot \\frac{1}{N^2}} = \\frac{1}{1/N} = N\n$$\nThus, for any case with $r=0$, the results are $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}(T) = E_{\\mathrm{typ}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T) = N$.\n\n**Case 2: One Rogue Walker ($r=1$)**\nIn this scenario, there are two distinct types of walkers. We can assign, without loss of generality, the index $i=1$ to the rogue walker and indices $i=2, \\dots, N$ to the typical walkers.\n-   The rogue walker has energy $E_1 = E_{\\mathrm{rog}}$.\n-   The $N-1$ typical walkers have energy $E_i = E_{\\mathrm{typ}}$ for $i  1$.\n\nTheir final unnormalized weights are:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T) \\equiv w_1(T) = \\exp(-T \\Delta \\tau\\,(E_{\\mathrm{rog}}-E_{\\mathrm{ref}}))\n$$\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T) \\equiv w_i(T) \\text{ for } i1 = \\exp(-T \\Delta \\tau\\,(E_{\\mathrm{typ}}-E_{\\mathrm{ref}}))\n$$\nThe sum of all weights, $S_w$, is:\n$$\nS_w = w_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T) + (N-1)w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)\n$$\nThe normalized weights are $\\tilde{w}_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T) = w_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T)/S_w$ and $\\tilde{w}_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T) = w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)/S_w$. The average energy is the weighted sum of the energies:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{avg}}(T) = \\tilde{w}_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T) E_{\\mathrm{rog}} + (N-1)\\tilde{w}_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T) E_{\\mathrm{typ}} = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T) E_{\\mathrm{rog}} + (N-1)w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T) E_{\\mathrm{typ}}}{w_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T) + (N-1)w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)}\n$$\nThe effective population is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T) = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{w}_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T)^2 + (N-1)\\tilde{w}_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)^2} = \\frac{S_w^2}{w_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T)^2 + (N-1)w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting $S_w$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T) = \\frac{\\big(w_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T) + (N-1)w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)\\big)^2}{w_{\\mathrm{rog}}(T)^2 + (N-1)w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(T)^2}\n$$\nThese general formulas will be used to solve the test cases.\n\n**Applying formulas to Test Cases:**\n\n-   **Test Case 1:** $(5, 0.1, 0, 1.0, 0.0, 0, 0.0)$\n    $r=0$. Using the derived results for this case: $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}(0) = E_{\\mathrm{typ}} = 1.0$ and $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(0) = N = 5.0$.\n\n-   **Test Case 2:** $(5, 0.1, 10, 1.0, 1.0, 0, 0.0)$\n    $r=0$. Similarly, $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}(10) = E_{\\mathrm{typ}} = 1.0$ and $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(10) = N = 5.0$. Note that $E_{\\mathrm{typ}} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0$, so all weights remain $1$ throughout the simulation, leading to the same result.\n\n-   **Test Case 3:** $(5, 0.1, 10, 1.0, 1.0, 1, -50.0)$\n    $r=1$. Parameters: $N=5$, $\\Delta \\tau=0.1$, $T=10$, $E_{\\mathrm{typ}}=1.0$, $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}=1.0$, $E_{\\mathrm{rog}}=-50.0$.\n    The product $T \\Delta \\tau = 1.0$.\n    Exponent for rogue walker: $-T \\Delta \\tau (E_{\\mathrm{rog}} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = -1.0(-50.0 - 1.0) = 51.0$.\n    Exponent for typical walker: $-T \\Delta \\tau (E_{\\mathrm{typ}} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = -1.0(1.0 - 1.0) = 0.0$.\n    Weights: $w_{\\mathrm{rog}}(10) = \\exp(51.0)$, $w_{\\mathrm{typ}}(10) = \\exp(0.0) = 1.0$.\n    $N-1=4$.\n    $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}(10) = \\frac{\\exp(51.0) \\cdot (-50.0) + 4 \\cdot 1.0 \\cdot 1.0}{\\exp(51.0) + 4 \\cdot 1.0}$. Since $\\exp(51.0)$ is astronomically large, $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}(10) \\approx \\frac{\\exp(51.0) \\cdot (-50.0)}{\\exp(51.0)} = -50.0$.\n    $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(10) = \\frac{(\\exp(51.0) + 4)^2}{\\exp(51.0)^2 + 4}$. As the weight of the rogue walker dominates, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(10)$ approaches 1.0. The effective population collapses to a single dominant walker.\n\n-   **Test Case 4:** $(10, 0.0, 100, 2.0, 1.0, 1, -20.0)$\n    $r=1$. Parameters: $N=10$, $\\Delta \\tau=0.0$, $T=100$, $E_{\\mathrm{typ}}=2.0$, $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}=1.0$, $E_{\\mathrm{rog}}=-20.0$.\n    The time step $\\Delta \\tau = 0.0$. This means the exponent in the weight update is always $0$.\n    $w_i(T) = \\exp(-T \\cdot 0 \\cdot (E_i - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})) = \\exp(0) = 1$ for all walkers.\n    All walkers have a final weight of $1$, regardless of their energies. The ensemble is equally weighted.\n    The normalized weights are $\\tilde{w}_i(100) = 1/N = 1/10$.\n    $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}(100)$ is the simple average of the energies of the $10$ walkers:\n    $E_{\\mathrm{avg}}(100) = \\frac{1}{10} (E_{\\mathrm{rog}} + (10-1)E_{\\mathrm{typ}}) = \\frac{1}{10}(-20.0 + 9 \\cdot 2.0) = \\frac{-2.0}{10} = -0.2$.\n    The effective population, for equally weighted walkers, is $N$:\n    $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(100) = N = 10.0$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the simplified Diffusion Monte Carlo problem for a given test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple is (N, delta_tau, T, E_typ, E_ref, r, E_rog)\n    test_cases = [\n        (5, 0.1, 0, 1.0, 0.0, 0, 0.0),\n        (5, 0.1, 10, 1.0, 1.0, 0, 0.0),\n        (5, 0.1, 10, 1.0, 1.0, 1, -50.0),\n        (10, 0.0, 100, 2.0, 1.0, 1, -20.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, delta_tau, T, E_typ, E_ref, r, E_rog = case\n\n        if r == 0:\n            # All walkers are identical.\n            # Local energy for all walkers is E_typ.\n            # Normalized weights are all 1/N.\n            e_avg = E_typ\n            n_eff = float(N)\n        else: # r == 1\n            # One rogue walker and N-1 typical walkers.\n            \n            # The exponent term simplifies to T * delta_tau.\n            # This correctly handles cases where T=0 or delta_tau=0,\n            # as the product becomes 0 and exp(0)=1.\n            time_product = float(T) * delta_tau\n\n            # Calculate final unnormalized weights\n            w_rog = np.exp(-time_product * (E_rog - E_ref))\n            w_typ = np.exp(-time_product * (E_typ - E_ref))\n\n            # Sum of weights\n            sum_of_weights = w_rog + (N - 1.0) * w_typ\n\n            # Calculate weighted average energy\n            # E_avg = (w_rog*E_rog + (N-1)*w_typ*E_typ) / (w_rog + (N-1)*w_typ)\n            e_avg_numerator = w_rog * E_rog + (N - 1.0) * w_typ * E_typ\n            \n            # Handle the case where all weights might hypothetically decay to zero,\n            # although not expected with the given test cases.\n            if sum_of_weights == 0.0:\n                 # This would lead to a 0/0 division.
