The angular frequency is related to the triplet state excitation energy $E_{T_{1}S_{0}}$ by the Planck-Einstein relation, $\\omega_{T_{1}S_{0}} = E_{T_{1}S_{0}} / \\hbar$.\n\nThe phosphorescence transition is nominally forbidden by spin selection rules. It gains intensity through spin-orbit coupling ($H_{\\mathrm{SO}}$), which mixes the character of a \"bright\" (spin-allowed) excited singlet state, $S_1$, into the \"dark\" $T_1$ state. Within the one-singlet-state mixing model provided, the squared magnitude of the effective transition dipole moment, $|\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}|^2$, is:\n$$ |\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}|^2 = \\left| \\frac{\\langle S_{1}|H_{\\mathrm{SO}}|T_{1}\\rangle}{\\Delta E_{ST}} \\right|^2 |\\mu_{S_{1}S_{0}}|^2 $$\nIn this expression, $|\\langle S_{1}|H_{\\mathrm{SO}}|T_{1}\\rangle|$ is the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling matrix element, which we will denote as an energy $E_{SO}$. The term $\\Delta E_{ST} = E_{S_{1}}-E_{T_{1}}$ is the energy gap between the $S_{1}$ and $T_{1}$ states, which can also be written as $\\Delta E_{ST} = E_{S_{1}S_{0}} - E_{T_{1}S_{0}}$. The term $|\\mu_{S_{1}S_{0}}|^2$ is the squared transition dipole moment for the allowed (and typically strong) $S_{1} \\leftrightarrow S_{0}$ transition.\n\nThe problem provides a relationship between $|\\mu_{S_{1}S_{0}}|^2$ and the dimensionless oscillator strength $f_{S_{1}S_{0}}$ for the $S_{1} \\leftrightarrow S_{0}$ transition:\n$$ |\\mu_{S_{1}S_{0}}|^2=\\frac{3\\hbar e^{2}}{2 m_{e}\\,\\omega_{S_{1}S_{0}}}\\,f_{S_{1}S_{0}} $$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $m_{e}$ is the electron mass, and $\\omega_{S_{1}S_{0}} = E_{S_{1}S_{0}} / \\hbar$ is the angular frequency of the $S_{1}\\leftrightarrow S_{0}$ transition.\n\nTo construct a single, unified formula for computation, we substitute these expressions into the equation for $A_{T_{1}\\to S_{0}}$. First, substituting the formula for $|\\mu_{S_{1}S_{0}}|^2$ into the expression for $|\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}|^2$:\n$$ |\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}|^2 = \\frac{E_{SO}^2}{(\\Delta E_{ST})^2} \\left( \\frac{3\\hbar e^{2}}{2 m_{e}\\,\\omega_{S_{1}S_{0}}}\\,f_{S_{1}S_{0}} \\right) $$\nNext, we substitute this result for $|\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}|^2$ into the primary rate equation for $A_{T_{1}\\to S_{0}}$:\n$$ A_{T_{1}\\to S_{0}} = \\frac{\\omega_{T_{1}S_{0}}^{3}}{3\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\hbar c^{3}} \\left[ \\frac{E_{SO}^2}{(\\Delta E_{ST})^2} \\left( \\frac{3\\hbar e^{2}}{2 m_{e}\\,\\omega_{S_{1}S_{0}}}\\,f_{S_{1}S_{0}} \\right) \\right] $$\nThis expression can be simplified. The factor of $3$ and the factor of $\\hbar$ in the numerator and denominator cancel:\n$$ A_{T_{1}\\to S_{0}} = \\frac{\\omega_{T_{1}S_{0}}^{3}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{0} c^{3}} \\frac{E_{SO}^2}{(\\Delta E_{ST})^2} \\frac{e^2}{2 m_e \\omega_{S_{1}S_{0}}} f_{S_{1}S_{0}} $$\nFinally, we replace the angular frequencies with their energy equivalents ($\\omega = E/\\hbar$). This is the most direct path for computation using the provided energy data:\n$$ A_{T_{1}\\to S_{0}} = \\frac{(E_{T_{1}S_{0}}/\\hbar)^{3}}{\\pi\\varepsilon_{0} c^{3}} \\frac{E_{SO}^2}{(E_{S_{1}S_{0}} - E_{T_{1}S_{0}})^2} \\frac{e^2}{2 m_e (E_{S_{1}S_{0}}/\\hbar)} f_{S_{1}S_{0}} $$\nFurther algebraic simplification by combining the powers of $\\hbar$ ($\\hbar^3$ in the denominator from the first term, $\\hbar$ in the denominator from the last term, resulting in $\\hbar^2$ overall in the denominator) leads to the final, compact expression used for computation:\n$$ A_{T_{1}\\to S_{0}} = \\frac{e^2}{2\\pi\\varepsilon_{0} m_{e} c^3 \\hbar^2} \\frac{E_{T_{1}S_{0}}^3 E_{SO}^2}{E_{S_{1}S_{0}}(E_{S_{1}S_{0}} - E_{T_{1}S_{0}})^2}\\,f_{S_{1}S_{0}} $$\nFor numerical implementation, all input quantities must be converted to base SI units.
