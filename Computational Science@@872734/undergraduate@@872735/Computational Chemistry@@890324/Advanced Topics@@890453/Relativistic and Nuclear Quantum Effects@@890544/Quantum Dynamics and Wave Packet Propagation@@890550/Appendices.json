{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before studying how quantum systems evolve, we often need to find their most stable configuration—the ground state. This practice introduces the powerful method of imaginary time propagation. By replacing real time $t$ with an imaginary counterpart $\\tau = it$, the Schrödinger equation behaves like a diffusion equation that filters out high-energy excited states, allowing an arbitrary initial wave function to relax into the system's ground state [@problem_id:2460933]. This technique is a cornerstone for preparing initial states and solving for the fundamental properties of quantum systems.", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional nonrelativistic quantum particle evolving according to the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE) in imaginary time.

It is a well-posed problem in computational quantum mechanics, grounded in the established principles of the Schrödinger equation and its numerical solution via imaginary time propagation. All parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires finding the ground state energy $E_0$ of a one-dimensional quantum system described by the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}=\\hat{T}+\\hat{V}$, where the kinetic energy operator is $\\hat{T}=-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\tfrac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}$ and the potential is $V(x)=a\\,(x^{2}-b^{2})^{2}$, working in dimensionless units where $\\hbar=1$ and $m=1$. The method to be used is imaginary time propagation.\n\nThe evolution of the wave function $\\psi(x,\\tau)$ in imaginary time $\\tau$ is governed by the imaginary time Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,\\tau)}{\\partial \\tau}=-\\hat{H}\\,\\psi(x,\\tau)\n$$\nThe formal solution to this equation over a small time step $\\Delta \\tau$ is given by:\n$$\n\\psi(x, \\tau+\\Delta\\tau) = e^{-\\hat{H}\\Delta\\tau} \\psi(x, \\tau)\n$$\nExpanding $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ in the basis of a complete set of energy eigenstates $\\phi_n(x)$ of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ with eigenvalues $E_n$, so that $\\psi(x, \\tau)=\\sum_n c_n(\\tau) \\phi_n(x)$, the evolution of the coefficients is $c_n(\\tau) = c_n(0)e^{-E_n\\tau}$. As $\\tau \\to \\infty$, the term corresponding to the lowest energy $E_0$ will dominate, provided the initial state has a non-zero overlap with the ground state, i.e., $c_0(0) \\neq 0$. Thus, $\\psi(x,\\tau)$ will converge to the ground state wave function $\\psi_0(x)$.\n\nThe core of the numerical task is to implement the propagator $e^{-\\hat{H}\\Delta\\tau}$. Since the kinetic operator $\\hat{T}$ and potential operator $\\hat{V}$ do not commute, we cannot simply write $e^{-(\\hat{T}+\\hat{V})\\Delta\\tau} = e^{-\\hat{T}\\Delta\\tau}e^{-\\hat{V}\\Delta\\tau}$. Instead, we use a second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, known as the split-operator or Strang splitting method:\n$$\ne^{-(\\hat{T}+\\hat{V})\\Delta\\tau} \\approx e^{-\\hat{V}\\Delta\\tau/2} e^{-\\hat{T}\\Delta\\tau} e^{-\\hat{V}\\Delta\\tau/2}\n$$\nThis approximation is accurate to order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta\\tau^3)$ for a single step, resulting in a globally second-order accurate algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm is implemented on a discretized spatial grid. The domain $x\\in[-L/2,L/2)$ is discretized into $N_x$ points $x_j = -L/2 + j\\Delta x$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N_x-1$, with grid spacing $\\Delta x=L/N_x$. The wave function $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ is represented by a vector of its values at these grid points, $\\psi_j(\\tau) = \\psi(x_j, \\tau)$.\n\nThe split-operator propagation step is executed as follows:\n$1$. The potential propagator $e^{-\\hat{V}\\Delta\\tau/2}$ is a local operator in position space. Its application is a simple pointwise multiplication: $\\psi'_j = e^{-V(x_j)\\Delta\\tau/2} \\psi_j$.\n$2$. The kinetic propagator $e^{-\\hat{T}\\Delta\\tau}$ is diagonal in momentum space. We use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to switch to the momentum representation. On the discrete momentum grid $k_m = 2\\pi f_m$, where $f_m$ are the discrete frequencies from `fftfreq`, the kinetic energy operator is $\\hat{T}(k_m) = k_m^2/2$. The propagation step in momentum space is thus a pointwise multiplication:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\psi}''_m = e^{-T(k_m)\\Delta\\tau} \\tilde{\\psi}'_m\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\psi}' = \\mathcal{F}[\\psi']$ is the forward FFT of $\\psi'$. The result is then transformed back to position space using the inverse FFT: $\\psi'' = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\tilde{\\psi}'']$.\n$3$. The second potential half-step is applied: $\\psi_{unnorm, j}(\\tau+\\Delta\\tau) = e^{-V(x_j)\\Delta\\tau/2} \\psi''_j$.\n\nThe imaginary time evolution causes the norm of the wave function to decay. To obtain the ground state eigenfunction, the wave function must be renormalized to unity after each propagation step. The norm is approximated by the sum $\\mathcal{M} = \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{N_x-1} |\\psi_{unnorm}(x_j)|^2 \\Delta x \\right)^{1/2}$. The normalized wave function for the next step is then $\\psi_j(\\tau+\\Delta\\tau) = \\psi_{unnorm, j}(\\tau+\\Delta\\tau) / \\mathcal{M}$.\n\nThe initial state is the normalized Gaussian $\\psi(x,0)=\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{N}}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$. The normalization constant $\\mathcal{N}$ is calculated on the discrete grid to ensure $\\sum_{j=0}^{N_x-1} |\\psi(x_j,0)|^2 \\Delta x = 1$. The chosen Gaussian is an even function, which has non-zero overlap with the ground state of the symmetric double-well potential, ensuring convergence to the correct state.\n\nThe instantaneous energy at time step $n$ is calculated as the expectation value $E_n = \\langle\\psi_n|\\hat{H}|\\psi_n\\rangle$. This is split into kinetic and potential energy contributions.\nThe potential energy is $E_V = \\int \\psi^*(x) V(x) \\psi(x) dx \\approx \\Delta x \\sum_{j} |\\psi_j|^2 V(x_j)$.\nThe kinetic energy is $E_T = \\int \\psi^*(x) (\\hat{T}\\psi(x)) dx$. The action of the kinetic operator, $\\hat{T}\\psi$, is calculated in Fourier space: $\\hat{T}\\psi = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[ (k^2/2) \\mathcal{F}[\\psi] ]$. The integral is then computed as a sum over the grid: $E_T \\approx \\Delta x \\sum_j \\psi_j^* (\\hat{T}\\psi)_j$. The total energy is $E_n = E_T + E_V$.\n\nThe propagation is iterated up to a maximum of $N_{\\text{max}}$ steps. At each step $n$, the energy $E_n$ is computed and compared to the previous step's energy $E_{n-1}$. The simulation is considered converged and terminates when $|E_n - E_{n-1}| < \\varepsilon$. If this condition is not met within $N_{\\text{max}}$ steps, the calculation stops and the final computed energy $E_{N_{\\text{max}}}$ is reported.

The formal solution over a small time step $\\Delta t$ involves the time-evolution operator $\\hat{U}(\\Delta t) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{H}\\Delta t)$.

This operation is computationally complex in position space but trivial in momentum space, where $\\hat{T}$ is a simple multiplication operator, $\\hat{T}_k = k^2/2$. We use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to switch between representations. The wave function is transformed to momentum space ($\\tilde{\\psi}'(k) = \\mathcal{F}[\\psi'(x)]$), multiplied by the kinetic evolution factor ($e^{-\\mathrm{i}k^2\\Delta t/2}$), and transformed back to position space ($\\psi''(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[e^{-\\mathrm{i}k^2\\Delta t/2}\\tilde{\\psi}'(k)]$).\n$3$.

The transmission probability $T$ is the time integral of the positive-directed current at the probe location $x_{\\text{probe}} = a/2 + 10$:\n$$ T \\;\\approx\\; \\sum_{n=0}^{N_t-1} \\max(J(x_{\\text{probe}}, t_n), 0) \\cdot \\Delta t $$\nwhere $t_n = n\\Delta t$ and $N_t = T_{\\text{end}}/\\Delta t$. This summation is performed over the entire simulation time.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by initializing the grid, potentials, and the normalized wave packet.

A particle in a double-well potential naturally tunnels back and forth, but the quantum Zeno effect suggests that frequent observation can stop this process entirely. In this simulation, you will implement a series of projective measurements to \"watch\" the particle and see if you can freeze its dynamics, preventing it from tunneling out of its initial state [@problem_id:2460919]. This exercise powerfully illustrates how observation is not a passive act in the quantum realm.", "problem": "Model a one-dimensional quantum Zeno effect for a particle in a symmetric double-well potential by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in atomic units, with repeated ideal projective measurements that confine the particle to the initial (left) well.

The quantum Zeno survival probability over the total time $T$ for a given measurement interval $\\tau$ is defined as\n$$\nS(\\tau,T) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\left\\lfloor T/\\tau \\right\\rfloor} p_k.\n$$\n\nAs a baseline comparison, define the no-measurement left-well probability at the final time $T$ (evolution without any projections) as\n$$\nP_{\\text{left}}(T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} |\\psi(x,T)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\n\nSpatial and temporal discretization to be used for all test cases:\n- Spatial domain: $x \\in [-L, L]$ with $L = 8.0$.\n- Number of spatial grid points: $N = 1024$ (uniform grid).\n- Time step: $\\Delta t = 0.005$.\n- Total simulation time: $T = 12.0$.\n\nTest suite specification (all quantities in atomic units):\n- Case 1 (frequent measurements): $\\tau = 0.05$.\n- Case 2 (moderate measurements): $\\tau = 0.20$.\n- Case 3 (sparse measurements): $\\tau = 1.00$.\n- Case 4 (baseline, no measurements): evolve to time $T$ without any projections and report $P_{\\text{left}}(T)$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Numerically propagate $\\psi(x,t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$ under the given Hamiltonian and discretization.\n- For Cases 1–3, apply the sequence of ideal measurements as defined, compute $S(\\tau,T)$, and report it.\n- For Case 4, do not apply any measurements and report $P_{\\text{left}}(T)$.\n\nAll answers are dimensionless probabilities.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum dynamics, is mathematically consistent, and its parameters are specified with sufficient precision to permit a unique numerical solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid and we shall proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe central task is to solve the one-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) for a particle in a double-well potential, subject to a series of projective measurements. The TDSE in atomic units ($\\hbar=1$, $m=1$) is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\,\\psi(x,t) = \\hat{H}\\psi(x,t) = \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V(x)\\right]\\psi(x,t)\n$$\nThe formal solution over a small time interval $\\Delta t$ is $\\psi(x, t+\\Delta t) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{H}\\Delta t)\\psi(x,t)$. We will employ the split-operator Fourier transform method to approximate the time-evolution operator $\\hat{U}(\\Delta t) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{H}\\Delta t)$. The Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is composed of a kinetic energy operator $\\hat{T} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ and a potential energy operator $\\hat{V} = V(x) = V_0(x^2 - b^2)^2$. Since $\\hat{T}$ and $\\hat{V}$ do not commute, we use a second-order symmetric Suzuki-Trotter (or Strang) splitting:\n$$\n\\hat{U}(\\Delta t) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}(\\hat{T}+\\hat{V})\\Delta t) \\approx \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{V}\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}) \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{T}\\Delta t) \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{V}\\frac{\\Delta t}{2})\n$$\nThis scheme is unitary and accurate to order $(\\Delta t)^3$. The propagation is executed as follows:\n1.  A half-step evolution under the potential operator $\\hat{V}$. This is straightforward in position space, as $\\hat{V}$ is a multiplicative operator: $\\psi(x) \\rightarrow \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}V(x)\\frac{\\Delta t}{2})\\psi(x)$.\n2.  A full-step evolution under the kinetic operator $\\hat{T}$. The kinetic operator is diagonal in momentum (or $k$-) space. We use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to switch from the position basis to the momentum basis. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ denote the FFT. In momentum space, the operator $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ corresponds to multiplication by $-k^2$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. The kinetic energy operator becomes multiplication by $T(k) = \\frac{k^2}{2}$. The evolution is then $\\tilde{\\psi}(k) \\rightarrow \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}T(k)\\Delta t)\\tilde{\\psi}(k)$, where $\\tilde{\\psi}(k) = \\mathcal{F}[\\psi(x)]$. After this step, we transform back to position space using the inverse FFT, $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}$.\n3.  A final half-step evolution under the potential operator $\\hat{V}$.\n\nThis three-step sequence propagates the wave function over a single time step $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe numerical simulation is set up on a spatial grid $x \\in [-L, L]$ with $N=1024$ points and $L=8.0$. The grid spacing is $\\Delta x = 2L/N$. The corresponding momentum grid for the FFT is constructed accordingly. The initial state is a normalized Gaussian wave packet centered in the left well ($x_0 = -b = -1.0$).\n\nFor the Zeno effect cases (Cases $1-3$), the time evolution is interspersed with measurements at intervals of $\\tau$. A simulation for a measurement interval $\\tau$ proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the wave function $\\psi(x,t=0)$ and the survival probability $S=1.0$.\n2.  Iterate for $k=1, 2, ..., \\lfloor T/\\tau \\rfloor$. In each iteration:\n    a. Propagate the wave function for a duration $\\tau$ using $M = \\tau/\\Delta t$ steps of the split-operator algorithm. This yields $\\psi(x, t_k^-)$.\n    b. Compute the probability of finding the particle in the left well ($x0$):\n       $$\n       p_k = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} |\\psi(x,t_k^-)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n       $$\n       This integral is computed numerically by summing $|\\psi(x_i)|^2 \\Delta x$ over all grid points $x_i  0$.\n    c. Update the total survival probability: $S \\leftarrow S \\times p_k$.\n    d. Project the wave function onto the left well. This is done by setting $\\psi(x_i, t_k^-) = 0$ for all $x_i \\ge 0$.\n    e. Renormalize the new state: $\\psi(x,t_k^+) = \\frac{(P_L \\psi)(x,t_k^-)}{\\sqrt{p_k}}$. This state serves as the initial condition for the next evolution period.\n\nFor the baseline case (Case $4$), no measurements are performed. The wave function is evolved continuously from $t=0$ to $t=T=12.0$. The final left-well probability $P_{\\text{left}}(T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} |\\psi(x,T)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x$ is then computed.\n\nThe algorithm is implemented for each of the four specified cases and the resulting probabilities are reported. The expected outcome is that more frequent measurements (smaller $\\tau$) will suppress the tunneling from the left well to the right well, leading to a higher survival probability $S$, a manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a double-well\n    potential to model the quantum Zeno effect, as per the problem statement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical and numerical parameters in atomic units\n    V0 = 0.2\n    b = 1.0\n    x0 = -b\n    sigma = 0.5\n    L = 8.0\n    N = 1024\n    dt = 0.005\n    T_total = 12.0\n\n    # Test cases from the problem statement\n    # A tau of 0.0 means the no-measurement case in this implementation.\n    test_cases_tau = [0.05, 0.20, 1.00, 0.0]\n\n    # --- Grid and Operator Setup ---\n    # Spatial grid (endpoint=False is better for FFT)\n    x = np.linspace(-L, L, N, endpoint=False)\n    dx = x[1] - x[0]\n\n    # Momentum grid. np.fft.fftfreq gives frequencies for which p = 2*pi*hbar*k_freq.\n    # With hbar=1, p = 2*pi*k_freq.\n    k_freq = np.fft.fftfreq(N, d=dx)\n    # Kinetic energy operator diagonal term T_k = p^2/(2m).
