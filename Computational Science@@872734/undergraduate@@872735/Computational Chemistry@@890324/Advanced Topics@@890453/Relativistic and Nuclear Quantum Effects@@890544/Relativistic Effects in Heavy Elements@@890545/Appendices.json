[@problem_id:1390846]", "problem": "Consider two heavy elements, Cesium (Cs) with atomic number $Z=55$ and Gold (Au) with atomic number $Z=79$. In their ground electronic states, the outermost valence electron for both atoms occupies a 6s orbital. The behavior of electrons in atoms with high nuclear charge can differ significantly from the predictions of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, especially for orbitals that have a non-zero probability density at the nucleus. Analyze the following statements that compare the properties of the 6s orbital in a gold atom to that of a cesium atom. Which statement most accurately describes the differences based on fundamental physical principles?\n\nA. The 6s orbital of gold is significantly contracted and stabilized (lower in energy) compared to cesium's 6s orbital. This is primarily due to relativistic effects, which become substantial for the high-velocity 6s electron near the massive gold nucleus, leading to a much higher first ionization energy for gold.\n\nB. The 6s orbital of gold is significantly expanded (larger average radius) compared to cesium's 6s orbital. The increased electron-electron repulsion from the 78 other electrons in the gold atom dominates over the increased nuclear attraction, making the orbital more diffuse.\n\nC. The 6s orbital of gold is contracted compared to that of cesium, but this confinement to a smaller volume increases the electron's kinetic energy so much that the orbital becomes destabilized (higher in energy). This results in a lower first ionization energy for gold than for cesium.\n\nD. The size of a 6s orbital is almost exclusively determined by its principal quantum number ($n=6$), so the average radii of the 6s orbitals in cesium and gold are nearly identical. The significant chemical differences between them arise from the lanthanide contraction, which affects the inner d- and f-orbitals but has a negligible direct effect on the valence 6s orbital.\n\nE. Relativistic effects in gold cause the spherically symmetric 6s orbital to distort into a non-spherical, dumbbell-like shape, similar to a p-orbital. This change in shape, rather than a change in size, is the primary reason for gold's unique chemical properties.", "solution": "We compare the 6s orbitals of cesium and gold using fundamental quantum and relativistic principles.\n\n1. Baseline nonrelativistic size and energy trends:\n- In a central Coulombic field, the characteristic radial scale of an orbital in the hydrogenic model is $r \\sim \\frac{n^{2} a_{0}}{Z_{\\text{eff}}}$, where $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective nuclear charge felt by the electron. Thus, even nonrelativistically, a larger $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ tends to contract and stabilize (lower the energy of) an $ns$ orbital.\n- In multielectron atoms, $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ for gold exceeds that for cesium due to poorer shielding by inner $d$ and $f$ electrons, so a nonrelativistic estimate already points to a smaller and more stabilized 6s in gold relative to cesium.\n\n2. Relativistic kinematics and their effect on $s$ orbitals:\n- For an electron in a Coulomb field with nuclear charge $Z$, the characteristic velocity scale is $\\langle v \\rangle \\sim \\frac{Z \\alpha}{n} c$ (hydrogenic estimate), where $\\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant. For large $Z$, $\\frac{v}{c}$ is no longer negligible.\n- The relativistic kinetic energy is $T = \\sqrt{p^{2} c^{2} + m^{2} c^{4}} - m c^{2}$, which, upon expansion for qualitative analysis, yields\n$$\nT \\approx \\frac{p^{2}}{2 m} - \\frac{p^{4}}{8 m^{3} c^{2}} + \\cdots .\n$$\nThe leading relativistic correction to the nonrelativistic kinetic energy is the mass-velocity term $-\\frac{p^{4}}{8 m^{3} c^{2}}$, which lowers the energy for states with large $\\langle p^{2} \\rangle$. Orbitals more localized near the nucleus have larger $\\langle p^{2} \\rangle$ by the uncertainty principle, and therefore receive a larger negative energy shift.\n- The Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian also contains the Darwin term for a point nucleus,\n$$\nH_{\\text{D}} = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^{2}}{2 m^{2} c^{2}} Z e^{2} \\delta(\\mathbf{r}),\n$$\nwhich gives a nonzero expectation value only for $s$ states (since $\\langle \\delta(\\mathbf{r}) \\rangle \\neq 0$ for $l=0$ and is zero for $l \\geq 1$). This contribution also lowers the energy of $s$ orbitals in a Coulombic field.\n- Thus, both the mass-velocity and Darwin relativistic corrections stabilize $s$ orbitals and favor increased probability density near the nucleus, i.e., a relativistic contraction of $ns$ orbitals. These effects scale strongly with $Z$.\n\n3. Consequences for gold versus cesium:\n- Gold has a much higher $Z$ than cesium and, correspondingly, a much larger $\\frac{v}{c}$ for its 6s electron. Therefore, relativistic stabilization and contraction of the 6s orbital are substantially stronger in gold.\n- This relativistic stabilization combines with the larger $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ in gold to produce a 6s orbital that is both more contracted and lower in energy compared to cesium. A more stabilized valence 6s electron implies that removing it requires more energy, i.e., a higher first ionization energy.\n- These points directly contradict the claims that electron-electron repulsion dominates to expand the orbital (since increased $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and relativistic corrections both contract and stabilize) or that contraction destabilizes via kinetic energy increase (the leading relativistic kinetic correction lowers the energy). They also contradict any claim that the 6s orbital becomes non-spherical: the central potential preserves $l=0$ spherical symmetry, so the 6s orbital remains spherically symmetric.\n\n4. Evaluation of the options:\n- A is consistent with the relativistic stabilization and contraction of $s$ orbitals at high $Z$, and with the resulting higher energy cost to ionize the 6s electron in gold relative to cesium.\n- B is incorrect because increased $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and relativistic effects dominate over electron-electron repulsion to contract and stabilize the 6s orbital.\n- C is incorrect because the leading relativistic corrections for $s$ orbitals stabilize rather than destabilize them, and gold does not have a lower first ionization energy than cesium.\n- D is incorrect because the size is not determined solely by $n$; $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and relativistic effects significantly influence the 6s orbital, and the relativistic effect on 6s is not negligible.\n- E is incorrect because an $s$ orbital remains spherically symmetric in a central field; relativistic effects do not change its angular momentum character into a p-like shape.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1390846"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal in computational chemistry is often to build models that predict molecular behavior.
