A $CT$ excitation involves moving an electron from a donor molecule, $D$, to an acceptor molecule, $A$, separated by a distance $R$. This process can be represented as $D^0A^0 \\rightarrow D^+A^-$. The energy of this excitation, $\\omega_{CT}$, is the difference in the total energies of the final and initial states:\n$$ \\omega_{CT} = E(D^+A^-) - E(D^0A^0) $$\nIn the limit of large separation $R$, the energy of a combined system can be approximated as the sum of the energies of its non-interacting constituent fragments plus their classical electrostatic interaction energy. For the initial neutral state, this is:\n$$ E(D^0A^0) \\approx E(D^0) + E(A^0) $$\nFor the final ionic state, the energy includes the electrostatic attraction between the newly formed ions:\n$$ E(D^+A^-) \\approx E(D^+) + E(A^-) + E_{\\mathrm{int}} $$\nHere, $E(X)$ represents the total energy of species $X$. The interaction energy, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$, between a point charge of $+1e$ on $D^+$ and $-1e$ on $A^-$ is given by Coulomb's law. In atomic units, where energy is in Hartree and distance is in bohr, this is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{int}} = -\\frac{1}{R} $$\nBy substituting these expressions into the equation for $\\omega_{CT}$, we obtain:\n$$ \\omega_{CT} \\approx \\left( E(D^+) + E(A^-) - \\frac{1}{R} \\right) - \\left( E(D^0) + E(A^0) \\right) $$\nRearranging the terms to group them by species yields:\n$$ \\omega_{CT} \\approx \\left( E(D^+) - E(D^0) \\right) + \\left( E(A^-) - E(A^0) \\right) - \\frac{1}{R} $$\nThe terms in parentheses correspond to fundamental definitions. The ionization potential of the donor, $I_D$, is the energy required to remove an electron:\n$$ I_D = E(D^+) - E(D^0) $$\nThe electron affinity of the acceptor, $A_A$, is the energy released upon capturing an electron, defined as:\n$$ A_A = E(A^0) - E(A^-) $$\nFrom this definition, it follows that $E(A^-) - E(A^0) = -A_A$. By substituting these definitions for $I_D$ and $A_A$, we arrive at the expression for the true large-separation charge-transfer excitation energy:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{true}} = I_D - A_A - \\frac{1}{R} $$\n\nNext, we derive the corresponding prediction from adiabatic semilocal Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory ($TD-DFT$), denoted $E_{\\mathrm{GGA}}$. Within linear-response $TD-DFT$, the excitation energies $\\omega$ are obtained as the eigenvalues of a matrix equation. For a single excitation from an occupied Kohn-Sham ($KS$) orbital $\\phi_i$ to a virtual $KS$ orbital $\\phi_a$, the excitation energy in the adiabatic approximation is given by:\n$$ \\omega_{ia} = \\varepsilon_a - \\varepsilon_i + K_{ia,ia} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_i$ and $\\varepsilon_a$ are the energies of the $KS$ orbitals, and $K_{ia,ia}$ is the coupling matrix element. This element depends on the Hartree-exchange-correlation ($HXC$) kernel, $f_{HXC}$:\n$$ K_{ia,ia} = \\iint \\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_a(\\mathbf{r}) f_{HXC}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}') \\phi_a^*(\\mathbf{r}')\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r}') d\\mathbf{r} d\\mathbf{r}' $$\nFor the $CT$ excitation under consideration, the occupied orbital $\\phi_i$ is the highest occupied molecular orbital of the donor ($HOMO_D$) and the virtual orbital $\\phi_a$ is the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the acceptor ($LUMO_A$). At large separation $R$, these orbitals are spatially isolated, and their overlap product, $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_a(\\mathbf{r})$, is negligible for all $\\mathbf{r}$.\nFor a semilocal functional, such as a Generalized Gradient Approximation ($GGA$), the kernel $f_{HXC}^{GGA}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}')$ is effectively local, meaning it vanishes rapidly as the distance $|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'|$ increases. The combination of a local kernel and vanishing orbital overlap causes the coupling integral $K_{ia,ia}$ to become zero:\n$$ K_{ia,ia}^{GGA} \\approx 0 $$\nConsequently, the $TD-GGA$ excitation energy spuriously reduces to the simple difference in the energies of the $KS$ orbitals involved:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{GGA}} = \\omega_{CT}^{GGA} \\approx \\varepsilon_{LUMO,A} - \\varepsilon_{HOMO,D} $$\nTo make this expression useful, we must relate this $KS$ orbital energy gap to the physical quantities $I_D$ and $A_A$. The fundamental many-body gap of the combined $D-A$ system is $E_{gap} = I_D - A_A$. The corresponding $KS$ gap is $\\varepsilon_{gap}^{KS} = \\varepsilon_{LUMO,A} - \\varepsilon_{HOMO,D}$. For an exact functional, these quantities are related via the derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation potential, $\\Delta_{xc}$:\n$$ E_{gap} = \\varepsilon_{gap}^{KS} + \\Delta_{xc} \\implies I_D - A_A = (\\varepsilon_{LUMO,A} - \\varepsilon_{HOMO,D}) + \\Delta_{xc} $$\nApproximate functionals like $GGA$ are known to suffer from a systematic error that effectively corresponds to a missing derivative discontinuity. The problem provides an effective parameter, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{xc}}  0$, to model this deficiency. Rearranging the equation for the $KS$ gap as predicted within a $GGA$ framework gives:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{LUMO,A}^{GGA} - \\varepsilon_{HOMO,D}^{GGA} = (I_D - A_A) - \\Delta_{\\mathrm{xc}} $$\nThis provides the final expression for the $TD-GGA$ charge-transfer excitation energy:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{GGA}} = I_D - A_A - \\Delta_{\\mathrm{xc}} $$\nThis result incorrectly shows the excitation energy approaching a constant value at large $R$, completely missing the correct $-1/R$ asymptotic behavior.\n\nFinally, we compute the signed error $\\Delta E$ and establish the condition for a spuriously low prediction. The error is the difference between the $GGA$ value and the true value:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{GGA}} - E_{\\mathrm{true}} = (I_D - A_A - \\Delta_{\\mathrm{xc}}) - \\left(I_D - A_A - \\frac{1}{R}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1}{R} - \\Delta_{\\mathrm{xc}} $$\nThe $GGA$ prediction is spuriously low if and only if $E_{\\mathrm{GGA}}  E_{\\mathrm{true}}$, which implies $\\Delta E  0$. This gives the condition:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R} - \\Delta_{\\mathrm{xc}}  0 \\implies \\frac{1}{R}  \\Delta_{\\mathrm{xc}} $$\nAs separation $R$ increases, $1/R$ decreases. For any system with a non-zero gap-underestimation error ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{xc}}  0$), there exists a separation beyond which this inequality holds, demonstrating the fundamental failure of adiabatic semilocal functionals for describing long-range charge transfer.
