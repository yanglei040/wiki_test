It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational quantum chemistry, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and is formulated objectively. The task is to calculate the arithmetic mean of three vertical excitation energies for the water molecule and explain the trend observed across different basis sets.\n\nThe vertical excitation energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vert}}$, is defined as the difference between the total electronic energy of the first electronically excited state, $E_{1}$, and the electronic ground state, $E_{0}$, with both energies computed at the fixed equilibrium geometry of the ground state. The mathematical definition is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vert}} = E_{1} - E_{0}\n$$\nWe calculate this energy difference for each of the $3$ basis sets using the provided data. All energies are given in Hartree units.\n\nFor the STO-3G basis set:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{STO-3G}} = E_{1, \\mathrm{STO-3G}} - E_{0, \\mathrm{STO-3G}} = (-74.645000) - (-74.965000) = 0.320000 \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\n\nFor the 6-31G* basis set:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{6-31G*}} = E_{1, \\mathrm{6-31G*}} - E_{0, \\mathrm{6-31G*}} = (-75.719000) - (-76.010000) = 0.291000 \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\n\nFor the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{aug-cc-pVDZ}} = E_{1, \\mathrm{aug-cc-pVDZ}} - E_{0, \\mathrm{aug-cc-pVDZ}} = (-75.751500) - (-76.026000) = 0.274500 \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\n\nAn analysis of the trend is required. The basis sets are listed in order of increasing size and flexibility: STO-3G, 6-31G*, and aug-cc-pVDZ. According to the variational principle of quantum mechanics, a more flexible basis set provides a better approximation to the true wavefunction, thereby lowering the calculated total energy towards the true, exact energy. The provided data confirms this: the total energies for both the ground state ($E_{0}$) and the excited state ($E_{1}$) become more negative (lower) as the basis set quality improves. Specifically, $E_{0, \\mathrm{aug-cc-pVDZ}} < E_{0, \\mathrm{6-31G*}} < E_{0, \\mathrm{STO-3G}}$ and $E_{1, \\mathrm{aug-cc-pVDZ}} < E_{1, \\mathrm{6-31G*}} < E_{1, \\mathrm{STO-3G}}$.\n\nThe calculated vertical excitation energies ($\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vert}}$) are $0.320000$ Hartree, $0.291000$ Hartree, and $0.274500$ Hartree, respectively. The trend is a decrease in excitation energy with increasing basis set quality. This observation implies that the improvement of the basis set stabilizes the excited state more than the ground state. This can be directly verified from the provided energy values. The change in energy when moving from the minimal STO-3G basis to the more sophisticated aug-cc-pVDZ basis is greater for the excited state than for the ground state.\nFor the ground state, the energy stabilization is:\n$$\n\\delta E_{0} = E_{0, \\mathrm{aug-cc-pVDZ}} - E_{0, \\mathrm{STO-3G}} = (-76.026000) - (-74.965000) = -1.061000 \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\nFor the excited state, the energy stabilization is:\n$$\n\\delta E_{1} = E_{1, \\mathrm{aug-cc-pVDZ}} - E_{1, \\mathrm{STO-3G}} = (-75.751500) - (-74.645000) = -1.106500 \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\nSince the magnitude of stabilization is larger for the excited state ($|\\delta E_{1}| > |\\delta E_{0}|$), the energy gap between the two states, $\\Delta E = E_{1} - E_{0}$, narrows as the basis set becomes more complete. This differential stabilization is expected, as excited states are typically more diffuse and require the flexibility afforded by diffuse and polarization functions, which are present in aug-cc-pVDZ but absent or limited in the simpler basis sets.\n\nNext, we compute the arithmetic mean of the three vertical excitation energies.\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta E} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{STO-3G}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{6-31G*}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{aug-cc-pVDZ}}}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta E} = \\frac{0.320000 + 0.291000 + 0.274500}{3} = \\frac{0.885500}{3} \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\nWe now convert this mean energy value to electronvolts (eV) using the provided conversion factor, $1 \\, \\text{Hartree} = 27.211386 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta E}_{\\mathrm{eV}} = \\left(\\frac{0.885500}{3}\\right) \\times 27.211386 \\, \\text{eV} \\approx 8.031945... \\, \\text{eV}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta E}_{\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 8.032 \\, \\text{eV}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.032}\n$$", "id": "2451815"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the basis set, the choice of the electronic structure method itself is paramount for obtaining accurate predictions.
