It is a standard, in fact, an elementary, problem in the application of multi-configurational methods. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nA CASSCF calculation is designed to correctly describe electronic structures where strong (or static) electron correlation is significant. Homolytic bond dissociation is the classic case. The fundamental principle for constructing a minimal active space to describe the breaking of a chemical bond is to include the electrons forming the bond and both the bonding and corresponding antibonding molecular orbitals. As the bond dissociates, these two orbitals become degenerate, and a proper description requires at least two configurations: one with the bonding orbital doubly occupied, and one with the antibonding orbital doubly occupied.\n\n1.  **Carbon–Carbon Single Bond (e.g., in $\\mathrm{H_3C-CH_3}$)**\n    A single bond is a $\\sigma$ bond, formed by two electrons. Near equilibrium, the ground state is dominated by the configuration where these two electrons occupy the bonding $\\sigma$ molecular orbital. Upon homolytic dissociation, $\\mathrm{R_3C-CR_3} \\to \\mathrm{R_3C}\\cdot + \\cdot\\mathrm{CR_3}$, the system becomes two radical fragments. This process can only be described qualitatively if the active space includes the two electrons of the $\\sigma$ bond and the two relevant orbitals: the bonding $\\sigma$ orbital and the antibonding $\\sigma^*$ orbital. The number of active electrons is $n=2$, and the number of active spatial orbitals is $m=2$. Therefore, the minimal active space is $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$.\n\n2.  **Carbon–Carbon Double Bond (e.g., in $\\mathrm{H_2C=CH_2}$)**\n    A double bond consists of one $\\sigma$ bond and one $\\pi$ bond. To describe its dissociation into two carbon fragments, one must account for the breaking of both bonds. Applying the principle from the single bond case to each component:\n    - For the $\\sigma$ bond, we require the $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^*$ orbitals.\n    - For the $\\pi$ bond, we require the $\\pi$ and $\\pi^*$ orbitals.\n    The electrons involved are the $2$ electrons from the $\\sigma$ bond and the $2$ electrons from the $\\pi$ bond, for a total of $n=4$ active electrons. The orbitals are the $\\sigma$, $\\sigma^*$, $\\pi$, and $\\pi^*$ orbitals, for a total of $m=4$ active spatial orbitals. Thus, the minimal active space is $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$.\n\n3.  **Carbon–Carbon Triple Bond (e.g., in $\\mathrm{HC \\equiv CH}$)**\n    A triple bond consists of one $\\sigma$ bond and two orthogonal $\\pi$ bonds (let us call them $\\pi_x$ and $\\pi_y$). To describe its complete homolytic cleavage, all three bonds must be broken. This necessitates including the bonding-antibonding pair for each bond in the active space:\n    - For the $\\sigma$ bond: $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^*$ orbitals.\n    - For the first $\\pi$ bond: $\\pi_x$ and $\\pi_x^*$ orbitals.\n    - For the second $\\pi$ bond: $\\pi_y$ and $\\pi_y^*$ orbitals.\n    The total number of active electrons is $2 (\\sigma) + 2 (\\pi_x) + 2 (\\pi_y) = 6$, so $n=6$. The total number of active spatial orbitals is $2+2+2=6$, so $m=6$. The minimal active space is therefore $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$.\n\nThe derived sequence of minimal active spaces for single, double, and triple bonds is $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$, $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$, and $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$, respectively.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Single: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$; Double: $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$; Triple: $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$**\nThis option perfectly matches the derived minimal active spaces. Each space correctly includes the bonding electrons and the associated bonding and antibonding orbitals for the bond(s) being broken.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Single: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$; Double: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$; Triple: $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$**\nThis option is incorrect. While $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ is correct for a single bond, it is insufficient for a double bond, as it can only describe the breaking of one of the two bonds (either $\\sigma$ or $\\pi$). Similarly, $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$ is insufficient for a triple bond, as it can only describe the breaking of two of the three bonds. The description of dissociation would be qualitatively wrong.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Single: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,1)$; Double: $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,2)$; Triple: $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,3)$**\nThis option demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding. A $\\mathrm{CAS}(n,m)$ with $m=n/2$ (assuming $n$ is even) corresponds to a single-determinant calculation where all active orbitals are doubly occupied. This is the Hartree-Fock reference itself, which is exactly the method that fails to describe dissociation. For a multi-configurational description of bond breaking, the number of active orbitals must be at least twice the number of bonds being broken to include the antibonding counterparts.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Single: $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$; Double: $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,6)$; Triple: $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,8)$**\nThis option suggests active spaces that are larger than the minimal requirement. While a $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,6)$ calculation for a double bond or a $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,8)$ for a triple bond could be performed and might improve the quantitative accuracy (by including dynamic correlation), they are not the *minimal* spaces required for a qualitatively correct description of bond dissociation, as the problem specifies. The minimal space only requires the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the bonds being cleaved.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2459002"}, {"introduction": "Why is a multi-configurational approach essential for bond breaking?
