The definitions of the subspaces, electron and hole restrictions, and orbital capacities are all standard and factually correct within this context. The problem is well-posed, asking for a mathematical formalization of these definitions. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary variables and constraints to derive the requested expression. All parameters are consistent with their physical meaning.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be constructed.\n\nThe task is to formulate a single set-builder expression that defines the set of all admissible integer triples $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ representing the electron distribution in the RASSCF active space. The constraints on these numbers are derived from the given physical principles.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Total Electron Number**: The total number of electrons in the three subspaces must equal the total number of active electrons, $N_{\\text{act}}$. As electron numbers must be integers, this gives the primary constraint:\n    $$n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = N_{\\text{act}}, \\quad \\text{where } n_1, n_2, n_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle (Subspace Capacity)**: Each of the $M_i$ spatial orbitals in a subspace $i$ can hold at most $2$ electrons. Therefore, the number of electrons $n_i$ in each subspace is bounded by its capacity. This also implies that the number of electrons cannot be negative.\n    -   For RAS1: $0 \\le n_1 \\le 2M_1$\n    -   For RAS2: $0 \\le n_2 \\le 2M_2$\n    -   For RAS3: $0 \\le n_3 \\le 2M_3$\n\n3.  **RAS1 Hole Restriction**: The number of holes in RAS1 is defined relative to full double occupancy. Full occupancy of RAS1 corresponds to $2M_1$ electrons. The number of holes, $h$, is thus $h = 2M_1 - n_1$. The problem states that the number of holes is at most $h_{\\max}$, which translates to the inequality:\n    $$2M_1 - n_1 \\le h_{\\max}$$\n    Rearranging this gives a lower bound for $n_1$:\n    $$n_1 \\ge 2M_1 - h_{\\max}$$\n\n4.  **RAS3 Particle Restriction**: The number of electrons, or \"particles,\" in RAS3 is restricted to be no more than $p_{\\max}$. This is a direct constraint on $n_3$:\n    $$n_3 \\le p_{\\max}$$\n\nNow, we consolidate these individual constraints into a minimal and complete set of conditions for the triple $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$.\n\n-   **Constraint on $n_1$**: The number of electrons in RAS1 must satisfy the Pauli capacity, $0 \\le n_1 \\le 2M_1$, and the hole restriction, $n_1 \\ge 2M_1 - h_{\\max}$. Combining these, the lower bound for $n_1$ is the maximum of $0$ and $2M_1 - h_{\\max}$, and the upper bound is $2M_1$.\n    $$\\max(0, 2M_1 - h_{\\max}) \\le n_1 \\le 2M_1$$\n\n-   **Constraint on $n_2$**: As per the problem statement, RAS2 is only restricted by its Pauli capacity.\n    $$0 \\le n_2 \\le 2M_2$$\n\n-   **Constraint on $n_3$**: The number of electrons in RAS3 must satisfy the Pauli capacity, $n_3 \\le 2M_3$, and the particle restriction, $n_3 \\le p_{\\max}$. Both conditions must be met, so $n_3$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of these two upper bounds. The lower bound is $0$.\n    $$0 \\le n_3 \\le \\min(p_{\\max}, 2M_3)$$\n\nFinally, we assemble all conditions into a single set-builder expression. The set of all admissible configurations $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ is the set of integer triples satisfying the total electron count conservation and the individual subspace restrictions simultaneously.\n\nThe complete admissibility constraint, expressed as a single set, is therefore:\n$\\{ (n_1, n_2, n_3) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3 \\mid (n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = N_{\\text{act}}) \\land (\\max(0, 2M_1 - h_{\\max}) \\le n_1 \\le 2M_1) \\land (0 \\le n_2 \\le 2M_2) \\land (0 \\le n_3 \\le \\min(p_{\\max}, 2M_3)) \\}$\nThis expression is the formal and complete answer derived strictly from the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\{ (n_1, n_2, n_3) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3 \\,|\\, (n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = N_{\\text{act}}) \\land (\\max(0, 2M_1 - h_{\\max}) \\le n_1 \\le 2M_1) \\land (0 \\le n_2 \\le 2M_2) \\land (0 \\le n_3 \\le \\min(p_{\\max}, 2M_3)) \\}\n}\n$$", "id": "2461626"}, {"introduction": "After a calculation is complete, how do we assess if our active space was chosen wisely?

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe assignment of orbitals to the RAS1, RAS2, and RAS3 subspaces must be guided by the physical and chemical nature of the orbitals, which is quantitatively reflected in their natural orbital occupation numbers (NOONs).\n\nFirst, we analyze the provided NOONs: $1.98$, $1.05$, $0.95$, and $0.02$.\n\nThe problem states the system is a diradical. A diradical is characterized by two electrons in two nearly degenerate orbitals. This electronic structure requires a multireference description to be properly modeled, as a single determinant is insufficient. The key feature is strong static correlation. Natural orbitals are the eigenfunctions of the one-particle reduced density matrix, and for a system with significant static correlation, some NOONs will deviate strongly from the integer values of $2$ or $0$ seen in a single-reference, closed-shell picture.\n\n-   The occupation numbers $1.05$ and $0.95$ are very close to $1$. These orbitals are singly occupied on average, with significant probability of having zero, one, or two electrons. They correspond to the two nearly degenerate orbitals that define the diradical character of the system. To capture the static correlation between these two electrons, full flexibility is required. Specifically, the configuration interaction (CI) expansion must include configurations where these orbitals are both singly occupied, as well as configurations where one is doubly occupied and the other is empty. The **RAS2** subspace is defined as being fully flexible, allowing any number of electrons and any excitation pattern. Therefore, the orbitals with occupation numbers $1.05$ and $0.95$ must be placed in RAS2.\n\n-   The occupation number $1.98$ is very close to $2$. This indicates an orbital that is predominantly doubly occupied. The small deviation from $2.0$ (i.e., $2.0 - 1.98 = 0.02$) is a result of dynamic correlation, where electrons are excited out of this orbital into weakly occupied orbitals. The **RAS1** subspace is designed for such orbitals. It is \"hole-restricted,\" meaning excitations *out of* these orbitals are permitted (creating a \"hole\"), which accounts for their NOON being slightly less than $2$, but excitations *into* them from other active orbitals are restricted. This is the correct choice for an orbital with NOON of $1.98$.\n\n-   The occupation number $0.02$ is very close to $0$. This indicates an orbital that is predominantly unoccupied. The small non-zero occupation is also due to dynamic correlation, where electrons are excited into this orbital from strongly occupied ones. The **RAS3** subspace is designed for this case. It is \"particle-restricted,\" meaning excitations *into* this orbital are permitted (creating a \"particle\"), which accounts for its non-zero NOON, but excitations *out of* it are restricted. This is the correct choice for an orbital with NOON of $0.02$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the logical and most reasonable assignment is:\n-   Orbital with NOON $1.98 \\rightarrow$ **RAS1**\n-   Orbital with NOON $1.05 \\rightarrow$ **RAS2**\n-   Orbital with NOON $0.95 \\rightarrow$ **RAS2**\n-   Orbital with NOON $0.02 \\rightarrow$ **RAS3**\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. $1.98 \\rightarrow$ RAS1; $1.05 \\rightarrow$ RAS2; $0.95 \\rightarrow$ RAS2; $0.02 \\rightarrow$ RAS3**\n    This assignment perfectly matches the derivation above. It correctly places the predominantly doubly occupied orbital in RAS1, the two near-singly occupied diradical orbitals in the fully flexible RAS2, and the predominantly unoccupied orbital in RAS3. This represents the most physically meaningful and computationally efficient partitioning.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. $1.98 \\rightarrow$ RAS2; $1.05 \\rightarrow$ RAS1; $0.95 \\rightarrow$ RAS3; $0.02 \\rightarrow$ RAS2**\n    This assignment is illogical. Placing the critical diradical orbitals ($1.05$ and $0.95$) into the restricted RAS1 and RAS3 subspaces would prevent the proper description of static correlation, defeating the purpose of the calculation. Furthermore, placing the nearly-full and nearly-empty orbitals ($1.98$ and $0.02$) in the fully flexible RAS2 space is a waste of computational resources and misapplies the RAS concept.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. $1.98 \\rightarrow$ RAS3; $1.05 \\rightarrow$ RAS2; $0.95 \\rightarrow$ RAS2; $0.02 \\rightarrow$ RAS1**\n    This assignment incorrectly inverts the roles of RAS1 and RAS3. It places the predominantly occupied orbital ($1.98$) into the particle-restricted RAS3 space and the predominantly unoccupied orbital ($0.02$) into the hole-restricted RAS1 space. This is a direct contradiction of the definitions of these subspaces.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. $1.98 \\rightarrow$ RAS1; $1.05 \\rightarrow$ RAS3; $0.95 \\rightarrow$ RAS2; $0.02 \\rightarrow$ RAS2**\n    This assignment incorrectly separates the two diradical orbitals ($1.05$ and $0.95$) into different subspaces (RAS3 and RAS2). To correctly model the diradical state, both orbitals must be in the same fully flexible RAS2 space to allow for all necessary configurations that describe their strong correlation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. $1.98 \\rightarrow$ RAS1; $1.05 \\rightarrow$ RAS1; $0.95 \\rightarrow$ RAS2; $0.02 \\rightarrow$ RAS3**\n    Similar to option D, this assignment incorrectly separates the two diradical orbitals. Placing the orbital with occupation $1.05$ into RAS1 and the one with $0.95$ into RAS2 is fundamentally wrong. Both must be treated on an equal footing within the fully flexible RAS2 space to capture the diradical nature.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2461678"}, {"introduction": "A successful computational chemist must be both a scientist and a strategist, balancing the quest for accuracy against finite computational resources.

I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\nDerivation of Solution\nThe problem concerns the computational treatment of the $\\text{H}_2$ molecule, which contains $2$ electrons. At its equilibrium geometry, the ground state is dominated by the Hartree-Fock configuration where both electrons occupy the bonding molecular orbital, $(\\sigma_g)^2$. However, as the internuclear distance is stretched, the $\\sigma_g$ and antibonding $\\sigma_u^*$ orbitals become nearly degenerate in energy. The ground-state wavefunction acquires significant character from the doubly excited configuration $(\\sigma_u^*)^2$. This near-degeneracy effect is known as static (or strong) correlation.\n\nTo correctly describe the dissociation of $\\text{H}_2$, a computational method must be able to treat the $(\\sigma_g)^2$ and $(\\sigma_u^*)^2$ configurations on an equal footing. The minimal method to achieve this is a Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) calculation involving the $2$ valence electrons in the $2$ valence orbitals ($\\sigma_g$ and $\\sigma_u^*$). This is denoted as CASSCF($2e, 2o$). In this calculation, a full Configuration Interaction (CI) is performed within the active space, and the MOs (both active and inactive) are simultaneously optimized.\n\nThe student's setup is a RASSCF calculation. In this framework, the active space is partitioned.\n- $\\text{RAS2}$ contains the $\\sigma_g$ and $\\sigma_u^*$ orbitals. This space is essential for capturing the static correlation.\n- $\\text{RAS1}$ is empty, which is appropriate as there are no core electrons to excite from.\n- $\\text{RAS3}$ contains $100$ virtual orbitals. The purpose of including these orbitals is to capture dynamic correlation, which arises from the instantaneous repulsion of electrons, causing them to scatter into high-energy virtual orbitals.\n\nThe student's calculation is a RASSCF($2e, 102o$) with the active space partitioned into $\\text{RAS2}(2o)$ and $\\text{RAS3}(100o)$. The constraint allows for a maximum of $2$ electrons in $\\text{RAS3}$. Since there are only $2$ electrons in total, the configurations included in the CI expansion are generated by the following partitions of electrons between $\\text{RAS2}$ and $\\text{RAS3}$:\n1.  $(n_{R2}=2, n_{R3}=0)$: $2$ electrons in $\\text{RAS2}$. This is a full CI within the ($2e, 2o$) space, which correctly handles static correlation.\n2.  $(n_{R2}=1, n_{R3}=1)$: $1$ electron in $\\text{RAS2}$ and $1$ in $\\text{RAS3}$. These are single excitations from the $\\text{RAS2}$ space.\n3.  $(n_{R2}=0, n_{R3}=2)$: $2$ electrons in $\\text{RAS3}$. These are double excitations from the $\\text{RAS2}$ space.\n\nThe inefficiency of this approach is severe and stems from two primary sources:\n1.  **Combinatorial Explosion of the CI Space**: The number of configurations involving $\\text{RAS3}$ is enormous. For the case of $2$ electrons in the $100$ orbitals of $\\text{RAS3}$, the number of singlet configuration state functions (CSFs) is $\\binom{100}{2} + \\binom{100}{1} = \\frac{100 \\times 99}{2} + 100 = 4950 + 100 = 5050$. Combined with single excitations and the reference space configurations, this leads to a very large CI matrix to be diagonalized in every iteration of the SCF procedure.\n2.  **Computational Cost of Orbital Optimization and Integral Transformation**: The cost of a RASSCF calculation scales steeply with the total number of active orbitals ($N_{act\\_o}$). Key steps like the transformation of the two-electron repulsion integrals from the atomic orbital (AO) basis to the active MO basis scale as a high power of $N_{act\\_o}$, roughly $O(N_{act\\_o}^4 N_{basis} + \\dots)$. With $N_{act\\_o}=102$, this step becomes computationally prohibitive. The orbital optimization itself is also far more complex and costly for such a large active space.\n\nThe student's approach attempts to solve for both static and dynamic correlation simultaneously in one massive, expensive calculation. This is fundamentally inefficient. The standard and correct approach is a two-step procedure that decouples the treatment of these two types of correlation:\n1.  First, perform a compact CASSCF($2e, 2o$) calculation. This has a negligible cost and correctly describes the static correlation, providing a qualitatively accurate potential energy curve and a good set of reference orbitals.\n2.  Second, use the resulting CASSCF wavefunction as a reference to add dynamic correlation using a more cost-effective post-CASSCF method. The preferred choice is typically multi-state second-order perturbation theory, such as CASPT2 or RASPT2. This method pertubatively accounts for excitations from the CAS reference space into a large external space of virtual orbitals without including them in the costly active space optimization.\n\nAn alternative, if one must use the RASSCF formalism, is to be highly selective about the orbitals in $\\text{RAS3}$. One would include perhaps $2$ to $4$ of the lowest-lying virtual orbitals, not $100$. This would provide a limited treatment of dynamic correlation at a much more manageable cost.\n\nOption-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. Yes, this is efficient. With only $2$ electrons, allowing up to $2$ particles in RAS3 across $100$ orbitals adds at most a few thousand configurations, which is negligible. No better approach is needed.\nThis statement is incorrect. The calculation is extremely inefficient. The claim that the resulting CI expansion size is \"negligible\" fundamentally misunderstands the scaling of electronic structure methods. As shown above, the number of configurations is substantial, but more critically, the cost of integral transformations and orbital optimization for a $102$-orbital active space is prohibitive. **Incorrect**.\n\nB. No, this is inefficient because the number of configurations scales combinatorially with the number of RAS3 orbitals and because orbital optimization and integral transformations also scale with the total number of orbitals. A better approach is to use a compact Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) with $2$ electrons in $2$ orbitals for static correlation, followed by a dynamic-correlation treatment such as Complete Active Space Second-Order Perturbation Theory (CASPT2) or Restricted Active Space Second-Order Perturbation Theory (RASPT2); alternatively, restrict RAS3 to a small set of low-lying virtuals.\nThis statement is entirely correct. It correctly identifies the sources of inefficiency: the combinatorial growth of the CI expansion and the high-order scaling of integral transformations and orbital optimization with the number of active orbitals. It proposes the professionally accepted, standard, and efficient two-step methodology (CASSCF for static correlation, followed by CASPT2/RASPT2 for dynamic correlation). It also provides a valid alternative within the RASSCF framework (using a small $\\text{RAS3}$). **Correct**.\n\nC. Yes, this is efficient because the Restricted Active Space (RAS) constraint removes all excitations beyond singles into RAS3 when at most $2$ particles are allowed. A better approach would be to increase the RAS3 particle cap to $4$ to further improve accuracy.\nThis statement contains multiple fundamental errors. First, the setup is not efficient. Second, the RAS constraint of allowing \"at most $2$ particles\" in $\\text{RAS3}$ for a $2$-electron system explicitly *allows* double excitations (where both electrons move into $\\text{RAS3}$), not just singles. The claim that excitations are restricted to singles is false. Third, suggesting an increase of the particle cap to $4$ is nonsensical, as the entire system contains only $2$ electrons. It is impossible to have $4$ electrons in any subspace. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. No, this is inefficient. A better approach is to move all $100$ virtual orbitals from RAS3 into RAS2 so that static correlation is captured exactly by a larger full-Configuration Interaction-like core active space.\nThis statement correctly identifies the inefficiency but proposes an absurd solution. Moving all $100$ virtual orbitals into $\\text{RAS2}$ implies performing a CASSCF($2e, 102o$) calculation. This means a full CI treatment within the $102$-orbital space. This would be even more computationally demanding than the student's original RAS setup in some respects, and it is conceptually flawed. The $100$ virtuals are for dynamic correlation, not static correlation. The principles of RASSCF are designed specifically to *avoid* full CI in large active spaces by partitioning them. This proposal defeats the entire purpose of the RAS method and unnecessarily expands the space for treating static correlation, which is already perfectly described by $2$ orbitals. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. No, this is inefficient. A better approach is to avoid any multireference method and perform a single-reference Hartree–Fock (HF) followed by Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2), since H$_2$ never requires multireference treatment, even at stretched geometries.\nThis statement correctly identifies the inefficiency but its reasoning and proposed solution are catastrophically wrong. The claim that $\\text{H}_2$ \"never requires multireference treatment, even at stretched geometries\" is a grave factual error that contradicts one of the most fundamental concepts in quantum chemistry. The dissociation of $\\text{H}_2$ is the classic textbook example for the failure of single-reference methods like HF and MP2 due to static correlation. Such a calculation would yield a qualitatively incorrect and physically meaningless potential energy curve. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2461619"}]}
