It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics, specifically the Green-Kubo formalism for transport coefficients. All parameters, definitions, and numerical procedures are specified completely and unambiguously. The problem is well-posed, objective, and free of internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe procedure to solve this problem involves a direct numerical implementation of the specified steps for each test case. The objective is to quantify the absolute error, $E = | D_{\\mathrm{method}} - D_{\\mathrm{true}} |$, for three different numerical integration schemes used to estimate the self-diffusion coefficient $D$ from a noisy velocity autocorrelation function (VACF).\n\nFirst, for each test case, we must generate the discrete, noisy VACF data, $\\{C_i\\}$. The parameters for each case are given by the tuple $(\\text{form}, \\tau, \\omega, \\Delta t, T_{\\max}, \\alpha)$.\n\nThe simulation time extends to a maximum of $T_{\\max}$, sampled with a time step of $\\Delta t$. The number of sample points, $N$, is given by $N = 1 + T_{\\max}/\\Delta t$. The time grid is a set of equidistant points $\\{t_i\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$, where $t_i = i \\cdot \\Delta t$.\n\nThe true, noise-free VACF, $C_{\\mathrm{true}}(t)$, is determined by the `form` parameter.\nFor `form` = `exp`:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{true}}(t) = 3 \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nFor `form` = `osc`:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{true}}(t) = 3 \\exp(-t/\\tau)\\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nNoise is then added to these true values. The noisy sample $C_i$ at time $t_i$ is $C_i = C_{\\mathrm{true}}(t_i) + \\eta_i$. The term $\\eta_i$ represents a random number drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $\\sigma = \\alpha C(0)$. Given that $C(0) = 3$, the standard deviation is $\\sigma = 3\\alpha$. A fixed random number generator seed, $s=12345$, must be used to ensure reproducibility of the stochastic component.\n\nNext, we compute the definite integral $I = \\int_0^{T_{\\max}} C(t)\\, dt$ using the generated noisy samples $\\{C_i\\}$ and three specified numerical quadrature rules:\n1.  Left-rectangle rule: This is a first-order method where the integral over each subinterval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$ is approximated by the area of a rectangle of height $C_i$ and width $\\Delta t$. The total integral is:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{rect}} = \\Delta t \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} C_i$$\n2.  Trapezoid rule: This second-order method approximates the integral over each subinterval by the area of a trapezoid formed by points $(t_i, C_i)$ and $(t_{i+1}, C_{i+1})$. The total integral is:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{trap}} = \\Delta t \\left(\\frac{1}{2} C_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} C_i + \\frac{1}{2} C_{N-1}\\right)$$\n3.  Composite Simpson’s rule: This is a fourth-order method that fits a quadratic polynomial to successive groups of three points. It is applicable here because the number of intervals, $N-1$, is specified to be even. The formula is:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{simp}} = \\frac{\\Delta t}{3} \\left(C_0 + C_{N-1} + 4 \\sum_{\\substack{i=1 \\\\ i \\ \\mathrm{odd}}}^{N-2} C_i + 2 \\sum_{\\substack{i=2 \\\\ i \\ \\mathrm{even}}}^{N-3} C_i \\right)$$\n\nFrom each of these integral approximations, $I_{\\mathrm{method}}$, we calculate the corresponding estimate of the diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\mathrm{method}}$, using the provided Green-Kubo relation. Since the integral in the formula is divided by a factor of $3$, we have:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{method}} = \\frac{1}{3} I_{\\mathrm{method}}$$\n\nTo evaluate the accuracy, we compare $D_{\\mathrm{method}}$ to the exact analytical value, $D_{\\mathrm{true}}$, derived from integrating the true VACF from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$.\nFor $C_{\\mathrm{true}}(t) = 3 \\exp(-t/\\tau)$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^{\\infty} 3 e^{-t/\\tau} dt = \\tau$$\nFor $C_{\\mathrm{true}}(t) = 3 \\exp(-t/\\tau)\\cos(\\omega t)$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^{\\infty} 3 e^{-t/\\tau}\\cos(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{\\tau}{1 + (\\omega \\tau)^2}$$\nNote that the numerical integration is performed over a finite interval $[0, T_{\\max}]$, while $D_{\\mathrm{true}}$ corresponds to an infinite integral. The resulting truncation error is part of the total error being measured.\n\nFinally, the absolute error for each method is computed as $E_{\\mathrm{method}} = | D_{\\mathrm{method}} - D_{\\mathrm{true}} |$. These errors are then rounded to six decimal places as required.

We will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to understand how the laboratory-frame particle velocities $\\mathbf{v}_i(t)$ and positions $\\mathbf{r}_i(t)$ are related to their counterparts in the COM reference frame, which is the frame where the total momentum is zero and true diffusive properties are defined.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{v}'_i(t)$ be the velocity of particle $i$ in the COM frame. The laboratory-frame velocity is then given by a simple Galilean transformation:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_i(t) = \\mathbf{v}'_i(t) + \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}}$ is the constant COM velocity. The velocities $\\mathbf{v}'_i(t)$ represent the thermal motion of the particles. By definition of the COM frame, their average over all particles is zero: $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbf{v}'_i(t) = \\mathbf{0}$. Furthermore, for a system at equilibrium in the COM frame, the ensemble average of a single particle's thermal velocity is zero: $\\langle \\mathbf{v}'_i(t) \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n#### Analysis of the Velocity Autocorrelation Function ($C_{vv}(t)$)\nWe substitute the expression for $\\mathbf{v}_i(t)$ into the definition of $C_{vv}(t)$:\n$$ C_{vv}(t) = \\frac{1}{3N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\langle (\\mathbf{v}'_{i}(t) + \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}})\\cdot (\\mathbf{v}'_{i}(0) + \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}})\\rangle $$\nExpanding the dot product and using the linearity of the ensemble average $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$:\n$$ C_{vv}(t) = \\frac{1}{3N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\langle \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(0) \\rangle + \\langle \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rangle + \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(0) \\rangle + \\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rangle \\right) $$\nLet's analyze the four terms in the sum:\n1.  $\\langle \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(0) \\rangle$: This is the VACF in the COM frame. For a fluid, thermal velocities decorrelate over time, so this term tends to $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n2.  $\\langle \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(t) \\rangle \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} = \\mathbf{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} = 0$, because the average thermal velocity is zero.\n3.  $\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(0) \\rangle = \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\cdot \\langle \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(0) \\rangle = \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\cdot \\mathbf{0} = 0$.\n4.  $\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rangle = \\langle \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 \\rangle = \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2$, since $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}}$ is a constant.\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $C_{vv}(t)$:\n$$ C_{vv}(t) = \\frac{1}{3N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}'_{i}(0) \\rangle + \\frac{1}{3N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 $$\nThe first part is the true VACF, $C'_{vv}(t)$. The second part simplifies to $\\frac{1}{3N} (N \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2$.\nSo, the measured VACF is:\n$$ C_{vv}(t) = C'_{vv}(t) + \\frac{1}{3} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 $$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, $C'_{vv}(t) \\to 0$. Therefore, the measured VACF approaches a non-zero positive constant:\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} C_{vv}(t) = \\frac{1}{3} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 $$\n\n#### Analysis of the Green-Kubo Estimate for $D$\nThe diffusion coefficient is calculated by integrating $C_{vv}(t)$. Using the result above:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{GK}} = \\int_0^\\infty C_{vv}(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty \\left( C'_{vv}(t) + \\frac{1}{3} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 \\right) dt $$\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{GK}} = \\int_0^\\infty C'_{vv}(t) dt + \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{3} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 dt $$\nThe first integral is the true diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\text{true}}$. The second integral diverges because the integrand is a positive constant:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{3} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 dt \\to \\infty $$\nIn any practical calculation where the integral is truncated at a finite time $t_{\\mathrm{max}}$, the estimate for $D$ will be approximately $D_{\\text{true}} + \\frac{1}{3} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 t_{\\mathrm{max}}$. This shows that the calculated value of $D$ will grow linearly with the integration time and will not converge.\n\n#### Analysis of the Einstein Estimate for $D$\nThe displacement of particle $i$ from time $0$ to $t$ is $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i(t) = \\mathbf{r}_i(t) - \\mathbf{r}_i(0)$. It can be found by integrating the velocity:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i(t) = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{v}_i(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_0^t (\\mathbf{v}'_i(\\tau) + \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}}) d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{v}'_i(\\tau) d\\tau + \\int_0^t \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} d\\tau $$\nThis gives $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i(t) = \\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) + t \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}}$, where $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t)$ is the displacement in the COM frame.\nNow we compute the mean-squared displacement (MSD):\n$$ \\langle \\lvert \\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i(t) \\rvert^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\lvert \\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) + t \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 \\rangle = \\langle (\\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) + t \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}}) \\cdot (\\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) + t \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}}) \\rangle $$\nExpanding the dot product:\n$$ \\langle \\lvert \\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) \\rvert^2 + 2t (\\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}}) + t^2 \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 \\rangle $$\n$$ = \\langle \\lvert \\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) \\rvert^2 \\rangle + 2t \\langle \\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) \\rangle \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} + t^2 \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 $$\nThe first term is the true MSD, which for long times is $\\langle \\lvert \\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) \\rvert^2 \\rangle \\approx 6 D_{\\text{true}} t$. The second term vanishes because the average displacement of a particle in the COM frame is zero, $\\langle \\Delta \\mathbf{r}'_i(t) \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}$, due to symmetry.\nThus, the measured MSD for large $t$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{MSD}(t) = \\langle \\lvert \\Delta \\mathbf{r}_i(t) \\rvert^2 \\rangle \\approx 6 D_{\\text{true}} t + t^2 \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 $$\nThe drift introduces a term that grows quadratically with time.\nThe Einstein calculation for $D$ is:\n$$ D_E = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\mathrm{MSD}(t)}{6t} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{6 D_{\\text{true}} t + t^2 \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2}{6t} $$\n$$ D_E = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left( D_{\\text{true}} + \\frac{t}{6} \\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2 \\right) $$\nSince $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, this limit diverges. The calculated quantity $\\mathrm{MSD}(t)/(6t)$ increases linearly with time and does not approach a constant value for $D$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. $C_{vv}(t)$ decays to zero as $t\\to\\infty$ as in equilibrium; both the Green–Kubo and Einstein estimates of $D$ are unaffected.\nThis is incorrect. As derived, $C_{vv}(t)$ decays to a positive constant, not zero. Consequently, both the Green-Kubo and Einstein estimates are severely affected, leading to divergence.\n\nB. $C_{vv}(t)$ approaches a positive constant $\\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}}\\rvert^{2}$ at long times; the Green–Kubo time integral diverges so any finite-time estimate of $D$ grows linearly with the integration limit, and the Einstein estimate exhibits an MSD with a quadratic-in-$t$ term, causing $\\langle\\lvert \\mathbf{r}_{i}(t)-\\mathbf{r}_{i}(0)\\rvert^{2}\\rangle/(6t)$ to increase without bound (no long-time plateau) unless the drift is removed.\nThis option provides an almost perfect description.\n-   $C_{vv}(t)$ approaches a positive constant: Correct. My derivation gives the constant as $\\frac{1}{3}\\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2$ based on the provided definition of $C_{vv}(t)$. The value $\\lvert \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\rvert^2$ would be correct for a VACF defined as $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i \\langle \\mathbf{v}_i(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_i(0) \\rangle$. This is a minor quantitative discrepancy due to differing conventions, but the qualitative statement is correct.\n-   Green-Kubo integral diverges, finite-time estimate grows linearly: Correct. This matches the derivation.\n-   Einstein MSD has a $t^2$ term, and its derived $D$ diverges: Correct. This also perfectly matches the derivation.\nThis option is the best description of the physical phenomena.\n\nC. $C_{vv}(t)$ becomes negative at long times due to enhanced hydrodynamic backflow from the drift; both routes underestimate $D$ relative to the true value.\nThis is incorrect. The dominant effect at long times is the positive constant offset, not hydrodynamic tails (which are much weaker and would be superimposed on the offset). Both estimates for $D$ are massive overestimates that diverge, not underestimates.\n\nD. $C_{vv}(t)$ is shifted upward by a constant, but the Green–Kubo integral remains finite because the mean speed is constant; the Einstein estimate is unaffected since it depends only on displacements, not velocities.\nThis is incorrect. While $C_{vv}(t)$ is shifted upward, the integral of a function approaching a non-zero constant is divergent, not finite. The reasoning \"because the mean speed is constant\" is irrelevant. The Einstein estimate is also fundamentally affected, as the constant velocity drift leads to a displacement that grows linearly in time, making the mean-squared displacement grow quadratically.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B is the only one that correctly describes the qualitative behavior of all quantities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2454535"}, {"introduction": "One of the most fundamental questions in computational science is, \"How long do I need to run my simulation?\" Answering this requires moving beyond a single calculation to understanding its statistical reliability.

It presents a standard, yet non-trivial, problem in computational statistical mechanics. We shall proceed with a complete solution derived from fundamental principles as requested.\n\nThe analysis begins with the Langevin equation for a particle of mass $m$ at temperature $T$:\n$$\nm \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = - m \\gamma \\mathbf{v}(t) + \\mathbf{R}(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient and $\\mathbf{R}(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise force with zero mean, $\\langle \\mathbf{R}(t) \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}$, and delta-correlation, $\\langle R_i(t) R_j(t') \\rangle = 2 \\Gamma \\delta_{ij} \\delta(t-t')$. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem dictates the relationship $\\Gamma = m \\gamma k_\\mathrm{B} T$, where $k_\\mathrm{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe consider a single Cartesian component of the velocity, say $v_x(t)$. The equation of motion is a first-order linear stochastic differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dv_x}{dt} + \\gamma v_x(t) = \\frac{R_x(t)}{m}\n$$\nThe formal solution for $v_x(t)$ starting from an initial velocity $v_x(0)$ at $t=0$ is given by:\n$$\nv_x(t) = v_x(0) e^{-\\gamma t} + \\int_0^t e^{-\\gamma(t-s)} \\frac{R_x(s)}{m} ds\n$$\nThe velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) for a single component, $C(t) = \\langle v_x(0) v_x(t) \\rangle$ for $t \\ge 0$, is found by multiplying the solution by $v_x(0)$ and taking the ensemble average. At stationarity, the noise at time $s>0$ is uncorrelated with the velocity at time $t=0$, i.e., $\\langle v_x(0) R_x(s) \\rangle = 0$. This yields:\n$$\nC(t) = \\langle v_x(0)^2 \\rangle e^{-\\gamma t}\n$$\nThe equipartition theorem for a classical system in thermal equilibrium states that the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom is $\\frac{1}{2} k_\\mathrm{B} T$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{2} m \\langle v_x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_\\mathrm{B} T$, which gives the stationary variance of a velocity component as $\\langle v_x^2 \\rangle = \\sigma_v^2 = \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m}$.\nThe VACF is therefore:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} e^{-\\gamma |t|}\n$$\nThe problem states the decay is characterized by a time $\\tau_v$, so we identify $\\gamma = 1/\\tau_v$. The single-component VACF is $C(t) = \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} e^{-|t|/\\tau_v}$.\n\nThe self-diffusion coefficient $D$ is defined by the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement (MSD):\n$$\nD = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{6t} \\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle\n$$\nThe displacement is the integral of velocity: $\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0) = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{v}(t') dt'$.

Let $C_{vv}(s) = \\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(s) \\rangle$. The double integral can be simplified to $2 \\int_0^t (t-s) C_{vv}(s) ds$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $D$:\n$$\nD = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{6t} \\left[ 2 \\int_0^t (t-s) C_{vv}(s) ds \\right] = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^\\infty C_{vv}(s) ds\n$$\nThis is the Green-Kubo relation for the diffusion coefficient. The full VACF is $C_{vv}(t) = \\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) \\rangle = \\sum_{i=x,y,z} \\langle v_i(0)v_i(t) \\rangle = 3C(t)$, since cross-correlations like $\\langle v_x(0)v_y(t) \\rangle$ are zero.\nSo, $C_{vv}(t) = 3 \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} e^{-|t|/\\tau_v}$.\nIntegrating this gives the diffusion coefficient:\n$$\nD = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^\\infty 3 \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} e^{-t/\\tau_v} dt = \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} [-\\tau_v e^{-t/\\tau_v}]_0^\\infty = \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} \\tau_v\n$$\nThis provides a crucial relation to determine the velocity correlation time $\\tau_v$ from the given parameters: $\\tau_v = \\frac{m D}{k_\\mathrm{B} T}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the statistical properties of the block estimator $D_{\\text{block}}$ defined for a finite cutoff time $t_c$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{block}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^{t_c} \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) dt\n$$\nThe expected value of this estimator is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{block}}] = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^{t_c} \\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) \\rangle dt = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_0^{t_c} C_{vv}(t) dt = \\int_0^{t_c} \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} e^{-t/\\tau_v} dt\n$$\nUsing $D = \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} \\tau_v$, we can write $\\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T}{m} = \\frac{D}{\\tau_v}$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{block}}] = \\frac{D}{\\tau_v} \\int_0^{t_c} e^{-t/\\tau_v} dt = \\frac{D}{\\tau_v} [-\\tau_v e^{-t/\\tau_v}]_0^{t_c} = D(1 - e^{-t_c/\\tau_v})\n$$\nThe variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(D_{\\text{block}}) = \\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{block}}^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{block}}])^2$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\text{block}}^2] = \\frac{1}{9} \\int_0^{t_c} dt_1 \\int_0^{t_c} dt_2 \\langle (\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t_1)) (\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t_2)) \\rangle\n$$\nThe four-velocity correlator must be evaluated.
