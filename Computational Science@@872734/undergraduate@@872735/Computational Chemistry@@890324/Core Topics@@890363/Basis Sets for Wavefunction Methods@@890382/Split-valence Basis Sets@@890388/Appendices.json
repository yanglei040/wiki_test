The Pople-style basis sets, like 6-31G, offer a systematic way to construct these sets. The notation provides a recipe for the number of functions used to represent the atomic orbitals of each atom in a molecule.\n\nConsider a single molecule of formaldehyde, which has the chemical formula $\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$. A computational study is planned using the `6-31G` basis set. To begin estimating the resources needed, you must first determine the total number of contracted basis functions for the entire molecule.\n\nThe rules for interpreting the `6-31G` basis set are as follows:\n*   For any second-row atom (from Lithium to Neon), the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted basis function. The valence shell (containing 2s and 2p orbitals) is represented by two sets of functions: an \"inner\" set and an \"outer\" set. The inner set consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions. The outer set also consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions.\n*   For a Hydrogen atom, its 1s valence orbital is represented by two separate s-type contracted functions.\n*   Note that a \"set of p-type functions\" always includes three distinct functions: $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$.\n\nCalculate the total number of contracted basis functions for one molecule of formaldehyde ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$) using the `6-31G` basis set.", "solution": "We identify the atoms in formaldehyde $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{O}$: one carbon (C), two hydrogens (H), and one oxygen (O). Carbon and oxygen are second-row atoms.\n\nBy the given 6-31G interpretation:\n- For each second-row atom, the contracted functions are the sum of the core 1s function and the valence split functions. The core contributes $1$ s-type function. Each valence set consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions, and each p-set contains $3$ functions ($p_{x}$, $p_{y}$, $p_{z}$).

Alex computes the ground-state electronic energy of a single dihydrogen molecule ($\\text{H}_2$) at a fixed internuclear distance of $R = 0.741$ Angstroms using the `6-31G` basis set. Next, Alex performs the exact same calculation for a single dideuterium molecule ($\\text{D}_2$) at the same internuclear distance $R$, using the same `6-31G` basis set and level of theory.

The `6-31G` basis set is a relatively small basis set and lacks the flexibility (e.g., polarization and diffuse functions) required to distinguish between isotopes. A much larger basis set, such as `aug-cc-pVQZ`, would show a difference in the electronic energies.\n\nB. The electronic Schrödinger equation, as solved in standard quantum chemistry calculations under the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, depends only on the positions and charges of the nuclei, not their masses. The basis set is used to describe the behavior of the electrons for this fixed nuclear framework.\n\nC. The student's observation is incorrect and likely due to a software error. The difference in nuclear mass leads to a different reduced mass for the molecule, which must alter the electronic wavefunction and therefore the electronic energy, even if the effect is small.\n\nD. The Gaussian functions in the `6-31G` basis set are centered on the nuclear positions. Since the mass of deuterium is different from hydrogen, the center of mass of the nucleus is slightly shifted, causing an artifact that coincidentally cancels the expected energy difference.\n\nE. The identity of the calculated energies is an artifact of neglecting the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE). The total energy, which is the sum of the electronic and vibrational energies, would be different, and modern electronic structure theory is only designed to be accurate for this total energy, not the electronic part alone.", "solution": "We identify the core theoretical framework: in standard quantum chemistry for a fixed nuclear geometry, the electronic energy is obtained by solving the clamped-nuclei (Born-Oppenheimer) electronic Schrödinger equation. The total molecular Hamiltonian can be written as\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hat{T}_{n} + \\hat{H}_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}; \\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}),\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{T}_{n}$ is the nuclear kinetic energy operator and $\\hat{H}_{e}$ is the electronic Hamiltonian with nuclei treated as fixed point charges at positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$. Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, one first solves the electronic eigenproblem\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}; \\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\Psi_{e} = E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\Psi_{e}.\n$$\nThe explicit form of the clamped-nuclei electronic Hamiltonian is\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{e} = \\sum_{i}^{N_{e}} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m_{e}} \\nabla_{i}^{2} \\right)\n- \\sum_{i,A} \\frac{Z_{A} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{r}_{i} - \\mathbf{R}_{A}|}\n+ \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{r}_{i} - \\mathbf{r}_{j}|}\n+ \\sum_{A<B} \\frac{Z_{A} Z_{B} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{R}_{A} - \\mathbf{R}_{B}|}.\n$$\nCrucially, $\\hat{H}_{e}$ depends on the electron mass $m_{e}$, the nuclear charges $Z_{A}$, and the nuclear positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$, but it does not contain the nuclear masses $M_{A}$. The nuclear masses $M_{A}$ appear only in the nuclear kinetic operator\n$$\n\\hat{T}_{n} = - \\sum_{A} \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 M_{A}} \\nabla_{A}^{2},\n$$\nwhich is not part of the clamped-nuclei electronic problem.\n\nFor $\\text{H}_{2}$ and $\\text{D}_{2}$ at the same internuclear distance $R$, we have identical nuclear charges ($Z_{A}=1$ for both isotopes) and identical nuclear positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$. Therefore, the operator $\\hat{H}_{e}$ is identical for $\\text{H}_{2}$ and $\\text{D}_{2}$. Since the operator is identical, the electronic eigenvalues $E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\})$ are identical for both species when computed at the same geometry and level of theory. A basis set, such as `6-31G`, provides an approximate representation of $\\Psi_{e}$ for this fixed nuclear framework; it does not introduce nuclear-mass dependence into $\\hat{H}_{e}$ and hence cannot create an isotope dependence in $E_{e}$ at fixed geometry. Enlarging the basis (for example, to `aug-cc-pVQZ`) improves the approximation to the same mass-independent eigenvalue and does not break the equality between isotopologues.\n\nThe observed spectroscopic differences (vibrational frequencies and bond dissociation energies including zero-point vibrational energy) arise when solving the nuclear Schrödinger equation on the electronic potential energy surface $E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\})$, where\n$$\n\\hat{T}_{n} \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) + E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) = E_{\\text{tot}} \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}).\n$$\nFor a diatomic molecule, the vibrational level spacings and zero-point energies depend on the reduced mass\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{M_{1} M_{2}}{M_{1} + M_{2}},\n$$\nwhich differs for $\\text{H}_{2}$ and $\\text{D}_{2}$. Hence vibrational frequencies and total energies including zero-point vibrational energy differ, even though the clamped-nuclei electronic energy $E_{e}$ at a fixed $R$ is the same.\n\nBeyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, there are small corrections such as the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) and mass-polarization terms that introduce a dependence on $M_{A}^{-1}$ into an effective electronic energy. However, standard electronic structure calculations that report the electronic energy at a fixed geometry typically do not include these terms by default, and even if included, they are small corrections; the fundamental mass-independence of $\\hat{H}_{e}$ within the clamped-nuclei framework remains the primary reason for the equality observed here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the electronic energy depends only on nuclear charges and positions, not on nuclear masses. This matches option B. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect for the following reasons:\n- A is incorrect because basis set size does not introduce nuclear-mass dependence into the clamped-nuclei electronic Hamiltonian; a larger basis would not change the equality across isotopologues at fixed geometry.\n- C is incorrect because, within the standard BO electronic problem, nuclear mass does not alter the electronic wavefunction or energy; any mass dependence arises only beyond BO and is not the default in typical calculations.\n- D is incorrect because Gaussian basis functions are centered on nuclear positions, which are the same; the nuclear center of mass is irrelevant to $\\hat{H}_{e}$ at fixed geometry.\n- E is incorrect as a cause of identical electronic energies: zero-point vibrational energy is a nuclear motion contribution added to $E_{e}$; neglecting it cannot explain the equality of $E_{e}$ itself, and modern electronic structure theory is explicitly designed to compute $E_{e}$ accurately.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1398967"}, {"introduction": "A key skill for a computational chemist is not just using basis sets, but knowing how to improve them strategically to achieve a specific goal.

The definitions and roles of split-valence basis sets (e.g., `6-31G`), polarization functions ($d$-functions on second-row atoms, $p$-functions on hydrogen), and their impact on molecular property calculations (equilibrium geometry) are standard textbook material. The provided definition of a polarization function is correct.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a qualitative comparison of the effectiveness of different, standard augmentations to a basis set for a specific, well-defined goal. The constraint \"exactly 1 set of polarization functions\" is a precise and critical condition that limits the possible valid choices. A unique, physically meaningful answer can be reasoned from established principles.\n3.  **Objective**: The question is objective. The relative importance of polarization functions on heavy atoms versus hydrogen atoms for determining molecular geometry is a matter of established computational fact, not opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard, conceptual question in theoretical chemistry. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe system is an isolated water molecule, H$_2$O. The basis set is `6-31G`, a Pople-style split-valence basis set. For the oxygen atom, the core $1s$ orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian-type orbital (CGTO) formed from 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). The valence shell is split: the inner valence ($2s$, $2p$) is described by one CGTO from 3 PGFs, and the outer valence is described by one CGTO from 1 PGF. For each hydrogen atom, the $1s$ orbital is similarly split into an inner part (3 PGFs) and an outer part (1 PGF).\n\nThis basis set lacks polarization functions. Polarization functions are functions with higher angular momentum ($l$) than any occupied orbital in the ground-state atom. For oxygen, whose valence shell is $2s^2 2p^4$, the highest angular momentum is $l=1$ ($p$-orbitals). Thus, polarization functions are $d$-type functions ($l=2$). For hydrogen ($1s^1$), the highest angular momentum is $l=0$ ($s$-orbital), so polarization functions are $p$-type ($l=1$).\n\nPolarization functions are essential for accurately describing the anisotropic nature of electron density in a molecule. Without them, the electron distribution around an atom is forced to be more spherical than it is in reality, leading to incorrect predictions of molecular geometry, particularly bond angles.\n\nThe problem requires adding \"exactly 1 set of polarization functions\". This means we must choose between:\n1.  Adding a set of $d$-functions on the oxygen atom. This yields the `6-31G(d)` basis set.\n2.  Adding a set of $p$-functions on the two hydrogen atoms. This yields the `6-31G(p)` basis set.\n\nThe goal is to most effectively improve the description of \"equilibrium geometry and bonding\". For a molecule like water, the geometry is centrally defined by the H-O-H bond angle. This angle is determined by the electronic environment of the central oxygen atom, which involves two bonding pairs and two lone pairs. The description of this tetrahedral-like, highly anisotropic environment is critically dependent on the flexibility of the oxygen atom's basis functions. Adding $d$-functions to oxygen allows the $p$-orbitals to polarize, or shift, which is necessary to form bent bonds and to correctly represent the spatial extent of the lone pairs. Without $d$-functions on oxygen, the calculated H-O-H bond angle is typically much too large. Numerous benchmark studies confirm that the single most important addition to a split-valence basis set for describing the geometry of molecules containing second-row atoms is the inclusion of $d$-type polarization functions on these heavy atoms.\n\nWhile $p$-functions on hydrogen are also important—they allow the hydrogen $s$-orbital to polarize towards the oxygen, improving the description of the O-H bond polarity and length—their effect on the bond *angle* is secondary to that of the $d$-functions on the central oxygen atom. Therefore, given the constraint of adding only one set, adding $d$-functions to oxygen is the most impactful choice for improving the overall molecular geometry.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Add one set of $d$-type polarization functions on oxygen only, i.e., use `6-31G(d)`, because the oxygen valence shell needs additional angular flexibility to describe bent bonding and lone pairs.**\nThis statement is correct. The central oxygen atom's electronic environment dictates the molecular geometry. The addition of $d$-functions provides the required angular flexibility to model the electron density distortion arising from bond formation and the presence of lone pairs. This is the most critical factor for accurately predicting the H-O-H bond angle.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Add one set of $p$-type polarization functions on both hydrogens only, i.e., use `6-31G(p)`, because the directionality of the O–H bonds and hydrogen bonding are controlled primarily by the hydrogen atoms.**\nThis statement is flawed. While $p$-functions on hydrogen are necessary for a correct description of bond polarity and are vital for intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding, the primary determinant of the *intramolecular* geometry (the bond angle) is the valence shell of the central oxygen atom. To claim that the hydrogens \"primarily\" control the directionality of bonding is incorrect; it is a cooperative effect where the central atom's hybridization and electronic structure are dominant for the overall shape. For an isolated molecule's geometry, $d$-functions on oxygen are more important.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Add one set of diffuse $s$ and $p$ functions on oxygen instead of polarization, because the lone pairs on oxygen are spatially extended and thus better captured by diffuse rather than higher-angular-momentum functions.**\nThis option proposes adding diffuse functions (e.g., to create the `6-31+G` basis) instead of polarization functions. Diffuse functions are low-exponent functions that are important for describing spatially extended electron density, such as in anions or Rydberg states. While oxygen's lone pairs are somewhat diffuse, the primary deficiency of the `6-31G` basis for geometry calculation is its lack of angular flexibility, not its description of the radial extent of the valence shell. Polarization functions are far more critical for obtaining correct bond angles than diffuse functions are. The problem explicitly asks about adding polarization functions. Suggesting to add diffuse functions *instead* is a diversion and represents a suboptimal strategy for the stated goal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Add both $d$-type functions on oxygen and $p$-type functions on hydrogen simultaneously, because adding polarization in an unbalanced way would increase Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE).**\nThis option violates the explicit constraint of the problem: \"constrained to add exactly 1 set of polarization functions\". Adding $d$-functions on oxygen and $p$-functions on hydrogen means adding two sets of functions, creating the `6-31G(d,p)` basis set. Therefore, this choice is not permissible. Furthermore, the justification regarding Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE) is misplaced. BSSE is an artifact that primarily affects the calculation of *intermolecular* interaction energies. It is not a relevant concept for the geometry optimization of a single, isolated molecule. While a balanced basis set like `6-31G(d,p)` is indeed superior, it is because it provides a more complete description of the electronic structure, not because of BSSE in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2462915"}]}
