{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The names of Dunning's basis sets, like \"correlation-consistent polarized valence double-zeta,\" are descriptive but dense. To truly grasp their meaning, it is instructive to understand the logic behind their construction. This practice challenges you to implement the rules that define the cc-pVDZ basis set for elements in the first three rows of the periodic table, transforming abstract principles into a concrete algorithm [@problem_id:2454399]. By doing so, you will gain a deep appreciation for what \"double-zeta valence\" and \"polarization\" mean in terms of the actual functions used in a calculation.", "problem": "You are to implement a program that models the construction of Dunning’s correlation-consistent polarized valence double-zeta (cc-pVDZ) basis set shell counts for main-group elements with atomic number $Z$ from $1$ through $18$. The goal is to return, for each $Z$, the number of contracted Gaussian-type orbital shells by angular momentum type, encoded as the ordered triple $[n_s,n_p,n_d]$, where $n_s$ is the number of $s$-type shells, $n_p$ is the number of $p$-type shells, and $n_d$ is the number of $d$-type shells.\n\nBegin from the following foundational principles and definitions:\n\n- In the correlation-consistent valence $n$-zeta (cc-pV$n$Z) design for main-group atoms, the valence space is represented with $n$ contracted radial functions per valence angular momentum channel, and one additional polarization shell at the next higher angular momentum ($\\ell_{\\max}+1$). For cc-pVDZ, $n=2$.\n- For main-group elements with $Z \\le 18$, the highest occupied angular momentum in the valence shell, $\\ell_{\\max}$, is determined by the electron configuration in a simplified manner:\n  - Period $1$ ($Z \\in \\{1,2\\}$): valence channels $\\{s\\}$ (i.e., $\\ell_{\\max}=0$).\n  - Period $2$ ($Z \\in \\{3,4\\}$): valence channels $\\{s\\}$; ($Z \\in \\{5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$): valence channels $\\{s,p\\}$ (i.e., $\\ell_{\\max}=1$).\n  - Period $3$ ($Z \\in \\{11,12\\}$): valence channels $\\{s\\}$; ($Z \\in \\{13,14,15,16,17,18\\}$): valence channels $\\{s,p\\}$ (i.e., $\\ell_{\\max}=1$).\n- For cc-pVDZ ($n=2$), assign $2$ contracted shells to each valence angular momentum channel present.\n- Add exactly one polarization shell at angular momentum $\\ell_{\\max}+1$: if $\\ell_{\\max}=0$, add one $p$ shell; if $\\ell_{\\max}=1$, add one $d$ shell.\n- To provide minimal radial flexibility for the inner closed $1s$ core, include one additional tight $s$ shell for all $Z \\ge 3$.\n\nYour task is to use these principles to algorithmically construct a function $build\\_cc\\_pvdz(Z)$ that returns the ordered triple $[n_s,n_p,n_d]$ for each $Z \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,18\\}$. You must not hard-code a lookup table; instead, implement the logic implied by the principles above.\n\nTest Suite:\nUse the following test values for $Z$: $[1,2,3,6,10,11,14,18]$.\n\nOutput Specification:\n- For each input $Z$ in the test suite, compute $[n_s,n_p,n_d]$ using the rules above.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each item is itself a list of three integers. Concretely, if the results for the eight test values are the triples $r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_8$, then the exact output must be a single line equal to the string representation of the Python list $[r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_8]$, for example, $[[a_1,a_2,a_3],[b_1,b_2,b_3],\\dots]$ where each $a_i$, $b_i$ is an integer.", "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum chemistry, specifically the construction of correlation-consistent basis sets. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information to derive a unique, algorithmic solution.\n\nThe objective is to formulate an algorithm that computes the number of contracted Gaussian-type orbital shells, denoted by the triplet $[n_s, n_p, n_d]$, for the cc-pVDZ basis set for main-group elements with atomic number $Z$ from $1$ to $18$. The derivation must be based on the provided first principles, not on empirical data or a pre-computed lookup table.\n\nThe logic proceeds in a sequence of deterministic steps for a given atomic number $Z$.\n\n1.  **Initialization**: We start with zero shells of each angular momentum type: $n_s = 0$, $n_p = 0$, and $n_d = 0$.\n\n2.  **Determination of Valence Space and $\\ell_{\\max}$**: The construction of a correlation-consistent basis set begins with the identification of the valence orbitals. The problem defines the valence space based on $Z$. The highest angular momentum quantum number in the valence shell is denoted $\\ell_{\\max}$.\n    - For elements in Period $1$ ($Z \\in \\{1, 2\\}$), Period $2$ s-block ($Z \\in \\{3, 4\\}$), and Period $3$ s-block ($Z \\in \\{11, 12\\}$), the valence space consists only of the $s$-orbital. Therefore, for these elements, $\\ell_{\\max} = 0$.\n    - For elements in Period $2$ p-block ($Z \\in \\{5, \\dots, 10\\}$) and Period $3$ p-block ($Z \\in \\{13, \\dots, 18\\}$), the valence space comprises both $s$ and $p$ orbitals. For these elements, $\\ell_{\\max} = 1$.\n\n3.  **Assignment of Valence Shells**: The cc-pVDZ basis set is of \"double-zeta\" quality, which corresponds to $n=2$ in the cc-pV$n$Z nomenclature. This means two contracted functions (shells) are assigned to each valence angular momentum channel.\n    - All specified elements ($Z \\in \\{1, \\dots, 18\\}$) have a valence $s$-channel. We therefore add $2$ to the $s$-shell count: $n_s \\leftarrow n_s + 2$.\n    - For elements with $\\ell_{\\max} = 1$, a valence $p$-channel is also present. For these elements, we add $2$ to the $p$-shell count: $n_p \\leftarrow n_p + 2$.\n\n4.  **Assignment of Polarization Shells**: To accurately describe electron correlation and molecular bonding, a single set of polarization functions is added. These functions have an angular momentum of $\\ell_{\\max} + 1$.\n    - If $\\ell_{\\max} = 0$, the polarization functions are $p$-type ($\\ell = 1$). We add $1$ to the $p$-shell count: $n_p \\leftarrow n_p + 1$.\n    - If $\\ell_{\\max} = 1$, the polarization functions are $d$-type ($\\ell = 2$). We add $1$ to the $d$-shell count: $n_d \\leftarrow n_d + 1$.\n\n5.  **Assignment of Core Shells**: For elements with $Z \\ge 3$, there exists a filled $1s$ core electron shell. To provide sufficient flexibility for describing this core, an additional \"tight\" $s$-function is included in the basis set. This is a special rule for elements beyond Period $1$.\n    - If $Z \\ge 3$, we add $1$ to the $s$-shell count: $n_s \\leftarrow n_s + 1$.\n\nCombining these steps, we construct the algorithm for any given $Z \\in \\{1, \\dots, 18\\}$.\n\nLet us apply this algorithm to two examples from the test suite.\n\n**Example 1: Hydrogen ($Z=1$)**\n- **Step 1 (Init)**: $[n_s, n_p, n_d] = [0, 0, 0]$.\n- **Step 2 ($\\ell_{\\max}$)**: For $Z=1$, we are in Period $1$. The valence channel is $\\{s\\}$, so $\\ell_{\\max}=0$.\n- **Step 3 (Valence)**: A valence $s$-channel is present. Add $2$ to $n_s$. Now we have $[2, 0, 0]$.\n- **Step 4 (Polarization)**: Since $\\ell_{\\max}=0$, we add one polarization $p$-shell. Add $1$ to $n_p$. Now we have $[2, 1, 0]$.\n- **Step 5 (Core)**: The condition $Z \\ge 3$ is false. No core $s$-shell is added.\n- **Final Result for $Z=1$**: The shell count is $[2, 1, 0]$.\n\n**Example 2: Silicon ($Z=14$)**\n- **Step 1 (Init)**: $[n_s, n_p, n_d] = [0, 0, 0]$.\n- **Step 2 ($\\ell_{\\max}$)**: For $Z=14$, we are in Period $3$, p-block. The valence channels are $\\{s, p\\}$, so $\\ell_{\\max}=1$.\n- **Step 3 (Valence)**: Valence $s$- and $p$-channels are present. Add $2$ to $n_s$ and $2$ to $n_p$. Now we have $[2, 2, 0]$.\n- **Step 4 (Polarization)**: Since $\\ell_{\\max}=1$, we add one polarization $d$-shell. Add $1$ to $n_d$. Now we have $[2, 2, 1]$.\n- **Step 5 (Core)**: The condition $Z \\ge 3$ is true. We add one tight $s$-shell for the core. Add $1$ to $n_s$. Now we have $[3, 2, 1]$.\n- **Final Result for $Z=14$**: The shell count is $[3, 2, 1]$.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this exact logic to systematically compute the shell counts for the given test suite of atomic numbers.
