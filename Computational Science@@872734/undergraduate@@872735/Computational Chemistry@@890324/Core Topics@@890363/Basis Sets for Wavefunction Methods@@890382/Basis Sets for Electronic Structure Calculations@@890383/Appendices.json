For a one-electron system like the hydrogen atom, the Hartree-Fock approximation is exact, as there is no electron-electron correlation. Therefore, any deviation of the calculated HF energy from the exact energy of $-0.5\\ E_\\mathrm{h}$ is due exclusively to the limitations of the chosen basis set. This is the definition of basis-set incompleteness error. The description of the hydrogen atom's ground state is correct. The variational principle correctly dictates that an approximate wavefunction will yield an energy greater than or equal to the true ground-state energy. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard, verifiable problem in computational quantum chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full analysis may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe exact ground-state wavefunction of the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom, the $1s$ orbital, is a Slater-Type Orbital (STO):\n$$\n\\Psi_{1s}(r) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi a_0^3}\\right)^{1/2} e^{-r/a_0}\n$$\nwhere $a_0$ is the Bohr radius and $r$ is the distance from the nucleus. In atomic units ($a_0=1$), this simplifies to $\\Psi_{1s}(r) = \\pi^{-1/2} e^{-r}$. This function exhibits two critical mathematical features:\n1.  An **electron-nuclear cusp** at the nucleus ($r=0$). The derivative of the wavefunction is non-zero at the origin. Specifically, Kato's cusp condition requires that for a one-electron atom, $\\left. \\frac{d\\Psi}{dr} \\right|_{r=0} = -Z\\Psi(0)$, where the nuclear charge $Z=1$ for hydrogen.\n2.  An **exponential decay** of the form $e^{-\\zeta r}$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nComputational chemistry calculations, for reasons of computational efficiency in evaluating two-electron integrals, almost universally employ Gaussian-Type Orbitals (GTOs) of the form $\\phi(r) = N e^{-\\alpha r^2}$. To better approximate an STO, a basis function is constructed as a linear combination of several PGFs, forming a Contracted Gaussian Function (CGF).\n\nHowever, a finite linear combination of GTOs is fundamentally incapable of perfectly reproducing the STO form due to two inherent mathematical differences:\n1.  The derivative of any GTO at the origin is zero: $\\left. \\frac{d}{dr} e^{-\\alpha r^2} \\right|_{r=0} = \\left. -2\\alpha r e^{-\\alpha r^2} \\right|_{r=0} = 0$. Consequently, any finite linear combination of GTOs will have a zero slope at the nucleus, failing to satisfy the cusp condition. This leads to a poor description of the wavefunction's behavior near the nucleus, where the electron-nuclear potential energy is dominant.\n2.  The decay of a GTO is proportional to $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, which is significantly faster than the STO's $e^{-\\zeta r}$ decay. This results in an inaccurate representation of the electron density at large distances from the nucleus (the \"tail\" of the wavefunction).\n\nThe basis set in question, 6-31G, is a Pople-style split-valence basis set composed of GTOs. The basis-set incompleteness error is the energy difference arising from these fundamental mathematical deficiencies of the GTO basis functions.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The absence of polarization functions on hydrogen in 6-31G (no $p$-type functions on H)**\n\nThe ground state of the isolated hydrogen atom is spherically symmetric, belonging to the totally symmetric irreducible representation of the full rotation group. The Hamiltonian is also spherically symmetric. According to group theory and quantum mechanics, the ground-state wavefunction cannot contain contributions from functions of higher angular momentum, such as $p$-type orbitals ($l=1$). Adding $p$-functions to the basis set will not lower the calculated energy for the isolated atom's ground state, as their coefficients in the final wavefunction will be exactly zero by symmetry. Polarization functions are crucial for describing the distortion of atomic orbitals in an anisotropic molecular environment, which is not the case here. Therefore, their absence is not a source of error for this specific problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. The lack of diffuse $s$-type functions on hydrogen in 6-31G (no `++` augmentation on H)**\n\nDiffuse functions are GTOs with very small exponents, designed to better model the long-range tail of the wavefunction. The lack of adequate diffuse functions in the 6-31G basis indeed contributes to the error, as it leads to an incorrect description of the wavefunction's exponential decay. However, this is only one aspect of the overall problem. The error originating from the failure to model the cusp at the nucleus is also extremely significant, particularly for the total energy, as the potential energy diverges at $r=0$. To claim this is the *primary* source of *most* of the error is a questionable assertion, as the cusp error is also a major contributor. This option describes a part of the problem but is not the most fundamental or complete explanation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The use of contracted Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to represent the hydrogen $1s$ orbital, which cannot satisfy the electron–nuclear cusp and the correct exponential decay with a finite number of Gaussians**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies the two fundamental and unavoidable mathematical failures of any finite GTO basis set when used to approximate an STO. It precisely articulates that GTOs are smooth at the origin and thus cannot form a cusp, and that their decay at long range is incorrect. These two failures are the root cause of the basis-set incompleteness error. This option provides a complete and fundamental explanation that encompasses the partial truth mentioned in option B (the decay) and adds the equally, if not more, important issue of the cusp. This is the definitive reason why the HF/6-31G energy is higher than the exact energy.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. The six-Gaussian core contraction indicated by the leading 6 in 6-31G (the core part of the split-valence basis)**\n\nThis statement is based on a misunderstanding of the Pople basis set notation. In the X-YZG scheme, the number X specifies the number of primitive Gaussians used to contract the single basis function for the core orbitals (e.g., the $1s$ orbital of a second-row atom like carbon). A hydrogen atom has only one electron in the $1s$ orbital, which is its valence shell; it possesses no core electrons. For hydrogen, the basis set is defined by the \"YZ\" portion of the name. In the 6-31G basis set, the hydrogen atom's $1s$ orbital is described by two $s$-type basis functions: an inner, contracted function made from $3$ primitive Gaussians, and an outer, uncontracted function consisting of a single primitive Gaussian. The \"6\" is irrelevant for hydrogen. Therefore, the premise of this option is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2450926"}, {"introduction": "Since any finite basis set is incomplete, a key strategy in high-accuracy studies is to systematically approach the 'complete basis set' (CBS) limit.
