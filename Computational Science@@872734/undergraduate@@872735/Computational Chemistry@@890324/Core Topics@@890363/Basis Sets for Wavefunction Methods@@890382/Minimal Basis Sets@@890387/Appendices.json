In a minimal basis set, one basis function is used to represent each atomic orbital required to accommodate all the electrons of the neutral atom in its ground state.

The problem states that a minimal basis set includes one basis function for each occupied core and valence atomic orbital of a neutral atom in its ground state. The total number of basis functions for the molecule is the sum of the basis functions for each of its constituent atoms. The formaldehyde molecule is composed of one carbon atom (C), two hydrogen atoms (H), and one oxygen atom (O).\n\nFirst, we determine the number of basis functions for a single hydrogen atom (H).\nA neutral hydrogen atom has an atomic number of 1. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^1$. The only occupied atomic orbital is the $1s$ orbital. Therefore, a minimal basis set for a hydrogen atom requires 1 basis function corresponding to the $1s$ orbital.\n\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions for a single carbon atom (C).\nA neutral carbon atom has an atomic number of 6. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The occupied atomic orbitals are the $1s$ (core), $2s$ (valence), and the three $2p$ orbitals ($2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$) (valence).

Counting these orbitals gives a total of $1 + 1 + 3 = 5$ basis functions for a carbon atom.\n\nThen, we determine the number of basis functions for a single oxygen atom (O).\nA neutral oxygen atom has an atomic number of 8. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$. Similar to carbon, the occupied atomic orbitals are the $1s$ (core), $2s$ (valence), and the three $2p$ orbitals ($2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$) (valence). The set of atomic orbitals is $\\{1s, 2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z\\}$.
