The fundamental base is the additivity of energies for non-interacting subsystems: when the total Hamiltonian factorizes as a direct sum, the energies add. Formally, let subsystem Hamiltonians be denoted $H_A$ and $H_B$ acting on disjoint Hilbert spaces with negligible inter-subsystem interaction at large separation $R$. The composite Hamiltonian is $H = H_A \\oplus H_B$, so the ground-state energy satisfies $E(A + B) = E(A) + E(B)$ when the subsystems are non-interacting. Size consistency is the property that a method returns $E_{\\text{method}}(A + B) = E_{\\text{method}}(A) + E_{\\text{method}}(B)$ when $A$ and $B$ do not interact. For two identical atoms, this reduces to $E_{\\text{method}}(\\text{He}\\cdot\\text{He}) = 2 E_{\\text{method}}(\\text{He})$ at sufficiently large interatomic separation $R$.\n\nUsing this base, design a numerical pass/fail test for size consistency defined as follows. For a given method, separation $R$ (in bohr), a monomer energy $E_{\\text{mono}}$ (in Hartree), a dimer energy $E_{\\text{dimer}}$ (in Hartree) computed at the same level of theory and basis, and a tolerance $\\tau$ (in Hartree), the method passes if and only if\n$$\n\\left| E_{\\text{dimer}} - 2 E_{\\text{mono}} \\right| \\le \\tau.\n$$\nAll energies must be in Hartree, and $R$ must be sufficiently large to render the interaction negligible.\n\nImplement a program that, given the test suite below, outputs a single list of booleans indicating for each case whether the method is size-consistent within the specified tolerance. The interatomic distance $R$ is provided for scientific completeness but does not enter the numerical criterion directly (it justifies the non-interacting assumption).\n\nUse the following test suite, intended to probe a variety of scenarios under a large basis where basis set superposition error is negligible:\n- Case $1$ (Hartree–Fock): $R = 30.0$ bohr, $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.861679995$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.723356990$ Hartree, $\\tau = 1\\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\n- Case $2$ (Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles): $R = 50.0$ bohr, $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.902786500$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.805572990$ Hartree, $\\tau = 1\\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\n- Case $3$ (Second-Order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory): $R = 40.0$ bohr, $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.902350000$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.804698000$ Hartree, $\\tau = 1\\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\n- Case $4$ (Configuration Interaction with Singles and Doubles): $R = 30.0$ bohr, $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.902500000$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.804800000$ Hartree, $\\tau = 1\\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\n- Case $5$ (Boundary case): $R = 35.0$ bohr, $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.900000000$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.800010000$ Hartree, $\\tau = 1\\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\n\nYour program must:\n- For each case, compute the absolute deviation $|E_{\\text{dimer}} - 2 E_{\\text{mono}}|$ and compare to $\\tau$.\n- Return a boolean for each case: `True` if the inequality holds and `False` otherwise.\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[True,False,True,True,False]\").", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It defines a correct and quantitative test for the fundamental quantum-chemical property of size consistency. The provided data are realistic and serve to illustrate the known behavior of several standard electronic structure methods. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe concept of size consistency is a critical requirement for any reliable quantum chemical method. It dictates that the energy of a system composed of two non-interacting subsystems, $A$ and $B$, must be equal to the sum of the energies of the individual subsystems. If the total Hamiltonian $H$ can be written as a direct sum of the subsystem Hamiltonians, $H = H_A \\oplus H_B$, then the total energy must be additive: $E(A + B) = E(A) + E(B)$.\n\nThe problem specifies a scenario with two identical, well-separated helium atoms, for which the interaction energy is negligible. In this case, the size consistency criterion simplifies. Let $E_{\\text{mono}}$ be the energy of a single helium atom, and $E_{\\text{dimer}}$ be the energy of the two-atom system (the \"dimer\") at a large separation distance $R$. A size-consistent method must satisfy the relation $E_{\\text{dimer}} = 2 E_{\\text{mono}}$.\n\nThe problem defines a numerical test for size consistency based on a tolerance, $\\tau$. A method is considered size-consistent if the absolute deviation from exact additivity is within this tolerance:\n$$\n\\left| E_{\\text{dimer}} - 2 E_{\\text{mono}} \\right| \\le \\tau\n$$\nWe define the size-consistency error as $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}} = E_{\\text{dimer}} - 2 E_{\\text{mono}}$. The test is thus to check if $|\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}| \\le \\tau$.\n\nWe now evaluate the five test cases provided.\n\nCase $1$: Hartree–Fock (HF)\nGiven: $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.861679995$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.723356990$ Hartree, and $\\tau = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\nThe size-consistency error is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}} = -5.723356990 - 2 \\times (-2.861679995) = -5.723356990 + 5.723359990 = 0.000003000 \\text{ Hartree}\n$$\nWe test the condition:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}| = |0.000003000| = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 1 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied.

This is expected, as all standard coupled-cluster methods are size-consistent.\n\nCase $3$: Second-Order Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory (MP2)\nGiven: $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.902350000$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.804698000$ Hartree, and $\\tau = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\nThe size-consistency error is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}} = -5.804698000 - 2 \\times (-2.902350000) = -5.804698000 + 5.804700000 = 0.000002000 \\text{ Hartree}\n$$\nWe test the condition:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}| = |0.000002000| = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 1 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. The result is $\\text{True}$. This is expected, as Møller–Plesset perturbation theory at any finite order is size-consistent.\n\nCase $4$: Configuration Interaction with Singles and Doubles (CISD)\nGiven: $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.902500000$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.804800000$ Hartree, and $\\tau = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\nThe size-consistency error is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}} = -5.804800000 - 2 \\times (-2.902500000) = -5.804800000 + 5.805000000 = 0.000200000 \\text{ Hartree}\n$$\nWe test the condition:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}| = |0.000200000| = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\le 1 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThe condition is not satisfied, as $2.0 \\times 10^{-4} > 1 \\times 10^{-5}$.

This imbalance leads to the lack of size consistency.\n\nCase $5$: Boundary Case\nGiven: $E_{\\text{mono}} = -2.900000000$ Hartree, $E_{\\text{dimer}} = -5.800010000$ Hartree, and $\\tau = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\nThe size-consistency error is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}} = -5.800010000 - 2 \\times (-2.900000000) = -5.800010000 + 5.800000000 = -0.000010000 \\text{ Hartree}\n$$\nWe test the condition, noting the use of less than or equal to:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}| = |-0.000010000| = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\le 1 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied because the absolute deviation is exactly equal to the tolerance.

A size-consistent and size-extensive electronic structure method such as Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles (CCSD) is assumed to recover this functional dependence to leading orders for the purpose of this test.\n\nNow, introduce a generic model of size inconsistency associated with Configuration Interaction with Singles and Doubles (CISD): when the ground and excited state total energies each contain a nonadditive correlation error that does not strictly cancel between states, the predicted band gap inherits a residual bias that does not vanish with $N$. To capture this effect at the level of the property, let the CISD-predicted band gaps follow\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{g,CISD}}(N)=E_{\\mathrm{g,true}}(N)+\\delta_{0}+\\frac{\\delta_{1}}{N},\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{0}$ (in electronvolts) is a residual state-dependent, nonadditive offset due to size inconsistency that persists as $N\\to\\infty$, and $\\delta_{1}$ (in electronvolts) captures subleading state-dependent finite-size mismatch.\n\nYour task. For each test case below:\n1. Generate the synthetic CCSD-consistent sequence $E_{\\mathrm{g,CCSD}}(N)$ by setting $E_{\\mathrm{g,CCSD}}(N)=E_{\\mathrm{g,true}}(N)$ for the provided $N$ values.\n2. Generate the synthetic CISD-inconsistent sequence $E_{\\mathrm{g,CISD}}(N)$ using the given $\\delta_{0}$ and $\\delta_{1}$ for the same $N$ values.\n3. For each sequence separately, estimate the infinite-polymer limit by a linear least-squares fit of the form\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{g}}(N)\\approx c_{0}+c_{1}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)+c_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{N^{2}}\\right),\n$$\nand report the fitted intercept $c_{0}$ as the extrapolated $E_{\\infty}$ (in electronvolts).\n4. For each method (CCSD-like and CISD-like) and each test case, compute the absolute error (in electronvolts) between the estimated $E_{\\infty}$ and the true $E_{\\infty}$ provided in the test case.\n\nNumerical and unit requirements:\n- All band gaps and errors must be expressed in electronvolts (eV).\n- Your program must round every reported floating-point output to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite. Use the following parameter sets. Each test case is a tuple containing: the list of $N$ values; the true $E_{\\infty}$; the coefficients $a$ and $b$ for $E_{\\mathrm{g,true}}(N)$; and the CISD bias parameters $\\delta_{0}$ and $\\delta_{1}$. All energies are in electronvolts, and $N$ is unitless.\n- Test 1 (general happy path): $([4,6,8,12,16],\\,2.0,\\,6.0,\\,1.5,\\,0.2,\\,0.1)$\n- Test 2 (no size inconsistency): $([4,8,12,20,40],\\,1.5,\\,4.0,\\,0.5,\\,0.0,\\,0.0)$\n- Test 3 (boundary: minimal fit points): $([5,10,20],\\,3.0,\\,3.0,\\,0.0,\\,-0.15,\\,0.0)$\n- Test 4 (strong curvature and subleading CISD mismatch): $([6,7,8,12,24],\\,1.0,\\,10.0,\\,5.0,\\,0.05,\\,-0.2)$\n- Test 5 (large-$N$ dominance): $([10,20,40,80,160],\\,0.8,\\,2.4,\\,0.4,\\,0.3,\\,0.0)$\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, append four floats to the result list in this order: the CCSD-like extrapolated $E_{\\infty}$ estimate, the CISD-like extrapolated $E_{\\infty}$ estimate, the absolute error of the CCSD-like estimate, and the absolute error of the CISD-like estimate. All values must be in electronvolts, each rounded to six decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For example, the output format must look like\n\"[x11,x12,x13,x14,x21,x22,x23,x24,...]\"\nwith no extra whitespace or text.\n\nYour implementation must be self-contained, require no user input, and adhere to the specified execution environment.", "solution": "The problem presented is a valid exercise in computational science. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It correctly uses simplified but physically meaningful models to construct a numerical experiment demonstrating a fundamental concept in quantum chemistry: the critical importance of size consistency for obtaining correct properties of large systems via extrapolation from smaller ones. We shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe central task is to quantify the error introduced in the extrapolation of an intensive property, the electronic band gap $E_g$, to the infinite polymer limit ($N \\to \\infty$) when using a size-inconsistent theoretical method. We are given models for the band gap of an oligomer of length $N$ as computed by a \"true\" or size-consistent method (like CCSD) and a size-inconsistent method (like CISD).\n\nThe true band gap is given by the functional form:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{g,true}}(N) = E_{\\infty} + \\frac{a}{N} + \\frac{b}{N^2}\n$$\nHere, $E_{\\infty}$ is the true band gap of the infinite polymer, and the terms with coefficients $a$ and $b$ represent finite-size corrections that vanish as $N$ increases. This form is physically motivated for quasi-one-dimensional systems. For the purpose of this problem, a size-consistent method such as CCSD is assumed to reproduce this behavior perfectly. Thus, we set:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{g,CCSD}}(N) = E_{\\mathrm{g,true}}(N)\n$$\n\nA size-inconsistent method like CISD introduces an error that does not scale correctly with system size. This is modeled by adding a bias term to the true energy:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{g,CISD}}(N) = E_{\\mathrm{g,true}}(N) + \\delta_{0} + \\frac{\\delta_{1}}{N}\n$$\nThe term $\\delta_0$ represents a non-additive, state-dependent error that persists even for infinitely large systems ($N \\to \\infty$). This is the mathematical signature of size inconsistency impacting an intensive property. The term $\\delta_1/N$ is a subleading size-dependent error. Substituting the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{g,true}}(N)$, we can rewrite the CISD model as:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{g,CISD}}(N) = (E_{\\infty} + \\delta_0) + \\frac{a + \\delta_1}{N} + \\frac{b}{N^2}\n$$\n\nThe procedure to estimate the infinite-limit band gap, $E_{\\infty}$, is to perform a linear least-squares fit on a set of calculated data points $(N_i, E_{\\mathrm{g}}(N_i))$ using the model:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{g}}(N) \\approx c_0 + c_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right) + c_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{N^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe extrapolated band gap is the fitted intercept, $c_0$. This is a standard multivariable linear regression problem. We seek to find the coefficients $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, c_1, c_2]^T$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals for the system of equations $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{c} \\approx \\mathbf{y}$, where:\n- $\\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of calculated band gaps, $[E_{\\mathrm{g}}(N_1), E_{\\mathrm{g}}(N_2), \\dots]^T$.\n- $\\mathbf{A}$ is the design matrix, where the $i$-th row is $[1, 1/N_i, 1/N_i^2]$.\n\nThe least-squares solution for the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$ is given by $\\mathbf{c} = (\\mathbf{A}^T\\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\mathbf{A}^T\\mathbf{y}$. We will compute this using the `numpy.linalg.lstsq` function.\n\nFor the size-consistent CCSD data, the generated points $(1/N_i, E_{\\mathrm{g,CCSD}}(N_i))$ lie exactly on the curve defined by the fitting model. Consequently, the least-squares fit will be perfect (within machine precision), yielding an extrapolated intercept $c_0 = E_{\\infty}$. The resulting error, $|c_0 - E_{\\infty}|$, should be effectively zero.\n\nFor the size-inconsistent CISD data, the generated points lie on a curve defined by $(E_{\\infty} + \\delta_0) + (a + \\delta_1)/N + b/N^2$. When we fit this data to the model $c_0 + c_1/N + c_2/N^2$, the least-squares procedure will find an intercept $c_0 \\approx E_{\\infty} + \\delta_0$. The extrapolated band gap is therefore systematically incorrect, and the error $|c_0 - E_{\\infty}|$ will be approximately $|\\delta_0|$. This directly demonstrates how size inconsistency prevents accurate extrapolation to the macroscopic limit.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n$1$. For a given set of $N$ values and parameters ($E_{\\infty}, a, b, \\delta_0, \\delta_1$), construct the design matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ with columns for $N^0$, $N^{-1}$, and $N^{-2}$.\n$2$. Generate the vector of \"data\" $\\mathbf{y}_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}$ using the $E_{\\mathrm{g,CCSD}}(N)$ formula.\n$3$. Solve $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{CCSD}} \\approx \\mathbf{y}_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}$ for $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}$ using least squares. The first element is the extrapolated gap, $c_{0,\\mathrm{CCSD}}$.\n$4$. Calculate the absolute error, $|c_{0,\\mathrm{CCSD}} - E_{\\infty}|$.\n$5$.
