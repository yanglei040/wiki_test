The model is based on first principles of statistical mechanics, within the ideal gas approximation. The total heat capacity is the sum of translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions:\n$$C_v(T) = C_{v,\\mathrm{trans}}(T) + C_{v,\\mathrm{rot}}(T) + C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}(T)$$\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. All required data and constants are provided, and the assumptions are clearly stated and physically reasonable for the specified system and temperature range. The model is a standard textbook application of statistical thermodynamics. We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nFirst, the universal gas constant $R$ is defined from the Avogadro constant $N_\\mathrm{A}$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_\\mathrm{B}$:\n$$R = N_\\mathrm{A} k_\\mathrm{B}$$\n\n**1. Translational Contribution ($C_{v,\\mathrm{trans}}$)**\nFor an ideal gas, the translational motion in three-dimensional space corresponds to three quadratic degrees of freedom. According to the equipartition theorem, each translational degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}T$ to the average energy per molecule. The total molar translational energy is therefore:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{trans}} = N_\\mathrm{A} \\left(3 \\times \\frac{1}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}T\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}RT$$\nThe translational contribution to the molar heat capacity at constant volume is the derivative of the internal energy with respect to temperature:\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{trans}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{trans}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$$\nThis contribution is constant with respect to temperature.\n\n**2. Rotational Contribution ($C_{v,\\mathrm{rot}}$)**\nThe nitrogen molecule, $N_2$, is a linear molecule. In the classical limit (which is valid for $T \\ge 10\\ \\mathrm{K}$ as the rotational temperature of $N_2$ is approximately $2.88\\ \\mathrm{K}$), there are two rotational degrees of freedom, corresponding to rotation about two axes perpendicular to the internuclear axis. Applying the equipartition theorem again, the molar rotational energy is:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{rot}} = N_\\mathrm{A} \\left(2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}T\\right) = RT$$\nThe rotational contribution to the molar heat capacity is consequently:\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{rot}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{rot}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = R$$\nThis contribution is also constant with respect to temperature under the given assumptions.\n\n**3. Vibrational Contribution ($C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}$)**\nThe vibrational motion must be treated quantum mechanically, as the vibrational energy spacing for $N_2$ is large. We model the single vibrational mode as a quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are given by $E_n = (n + 1/2)h\\nu$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$, where $\\nu$ is the fundamental vibrational frequency. The frequency $\\nu$ is related to the given wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ by $\\nu = c\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nThe molecular vibrational partition function $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is the sum over all vibrational states:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-E_n / (k_\\mathrm{B}T)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-(n+1/2)h\\nu / (k_\\mathrm{B}T)} = e^{-h\\nu / (2k_\\mathrm{B}T)} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(e^{-h\\nu / (k_\\mathrm{B}T)}\\right)^n$$\nThis is a geometric series which converges to:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\frac{e^{-h\\nu / (2k_\\mathrm{B}T)}}{1 - e^{-h\\nu / (k_\\mathrm{B}T)}}$$\nThe molar vibrational internal energy $U_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is related to the partition function by:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = N_\\mathrm{A} k_\\mathrm{B} T^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$$\nSubstituting $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ and differentiating yields:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = N_\\mathrm{A} \\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{2} + \\frac{h\\nu}{e^{h\\nu/(k_\\mathrm{B}T)} - 1}\\right)$$\nThe molar vibrational heat capacity is the derivative of $U_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ with respect to $T$. The zero-point energy term $N_\\mathrm{A} h\\nu/2$ is constant and does not contribute.\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left(\\frac{N_\\mathrm{A} h\\nu}{e^{h\\nu/(k_\\mathrm{B}T)} - 1}\\right)$$\nIt is convenient to define a characteristic vibrational temperature, $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}} = h\\nu/k_\\mathrm{B} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}/k_\\mathrm{B}$.\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = R \\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}/T}}{\\left(e^{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}/T} - 1\\right)^2}$$\nThis contribution is strongly dependent on temperature. At low temperatures ($T \\ll \\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}$), $C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}} \\to 0$. At high temperatures ($T \\gg \\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}$), $C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}} \\to R$, which is the classical limit.\n\n**4. Total Molar Heat Capacity ($C_v$)**\nSumming all contributions gives the total molar heat capacity:\n$$C_v(T) = \\frac{3}{2}R + R + C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\frac{5}{2}R + R \\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}/T}}{\\left(e^{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}/T} - 1\\right)^2}$$\n\n**5. Calculation of $T_\\mathrm{sig}$**\nThe second task is to find the temperature $T_\\mathrm{sig}$ where the vibrational contribution reaches $5\\%$ of its classical limit, $R$. This requires solving the following equation for $T$:\n$$C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = 0.05\\,R$$\n$$R \\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}/T}}{\\left(e^{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}/T} - 1\\right)^2} = 0.05\\,R$$\nThis transcendental equation is solved numerically. Since $C_{v,\\mathrm{vib}}(T)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $T$, a unique solution for $T_\\mathrm{sig}$ exists and can be found efficiently using a root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method, over the specified interval $[10, 4000]\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe implementation will first compute the constants $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ and $R$, then evaluate $C_v(T)$ at the specified temperatures, and finally solve for $T_\\mathrm{sig}$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import constants\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molar heat capacity of N2 and a characteristic temperature\n    based on a statistical mechanics model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

While the RRHO approximation is standard for polyatomic molecules, its application to a monatomic species represents a limiting case. A single atom possesses $3$ degrees of freedom, which are all translational. It possesses no internal structure that could give rise to vibrations or rotations.\n-   **Vibrational Contribution**: The harmonic oscillator model describes the vibrations of chemical bonds. A single atom has no bonds, and thus no vibrational modes. The number of vibrational normal modes for a molecule of $N$ atoms is $3N-6$ (for nonlinear molecules) or $3N-5$ (for linear molecules). For $N=1$, these formulae are not applicable, and more fundamentally, there are no internal coordinates that can vibrate.\n-   **Rotational Contribution**: The rigid rotor model describes the rotation of a body with non-zero moments of inertia. A single atom, being a point mass, has zero moment of inertia about any axis passing through its center.\nThe problem is not scientifically unsound. It is a valid, if subtle, test of the applicability of the RRHO model, where the vibrational and rotational contributions must correctly be identified as zero. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and all data required for the calculation of the translational entropy are provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe molar entropy $S$ is derived from the molecular partition function $q$ using the formula $S = R(\\ln(q/N_A) + 1) + U/T$, where $U$ is the internal energy. For an ideal gas, the total partition function is a product of contributions: $q = q_{\\mathrm{trans}} q_{\\mathrm{rot}} q_{\\mathrm{vib}} q_{\\mathrm{el}}$. The entropy is correspondingly a sum of contributions: $S = S_{\\mathrm{trans}} + S_{\\mathrm{rot}} + S_{\\mathrm{vib}} + S_{\\mathrm{el}}$. The problem specifies a nondegenerate electronic ground state, which means the electronic partition function $q_{\\mathrm{el}} = 1$ and therefore the electronic entropy contribution $S_{\\mathrm{el}} = R \\ln q_{\\mathrm{el}} = 0$.\n\n**Vibrational Molar Entropy ($S_{\\mathrm{vib}}$)**\nA helium atom has only one nucleus ($N=1$) and no chemical bonds. Consequently, it has no vibrational degrees of freedom. The vibrational partition function $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is therefore unity.\n$$q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 1$$\nThe molar vibrational entropy is given by $S_{\\mathrm{vib}} = R \\left( \\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}} + T \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{\\partial T} \\right)_V \\right)$. With $q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 1$, we have $\\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 0$.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{vib}} = 0$$\n\n**Rotational Molar Entropy ($S_{\\mathrm{rot}}$)**\nA helium atom is spherically symmetric. In quantum mechanics, it is treated as a point mass. The moment of inertia $I$ about its center of mass is zero. The rotational energy levels are given by $E_J = \\frac{\\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2I}$. For $I \\to 0$, the energy spacing between levels becomes infinite. Only the ground state with rotational quantum number $J=0$ is accessible at any finite temperature. The rotational partition function is sum over states $g_J \\exp(-E_J/k_B T)$, which reduces to the degeneracy of the ground state. For a single atom, the ground rotational state is nondegenerate, so $q_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 1$. The nuclear spin contribution is conventionally ignored unless specified.\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 1$$\nSimilar to the vibrational case, with $q_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 1$, the molar rotational entropy $S_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ is zero.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 0$$\n\n**Translational Molar Entropy ($S_{\\mathrm{trans}}$)**\nThe translational motion is the only contribution to the entropy for a monatomic ideal gas, aside from electronic and nuclear spin contributions. The molar translational entropy is given by the Sackur-Tetrode equation:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{trans}} = R \\left[ \\ln\\left( \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi m k_B T}{h^2} \\right)^{3/2} \\frac{k_B T}{p} \\right) + \\frac{5}{2} \\right]$$\nWe must now substitute the given values.\nFirst, the mass of a single helium atom in SI units:\n$$m = 4.002602\\ \\mathrm{u} \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg/u} = 6.64647634 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\nNow we compute the argument of the logarithm.

Only the zero-point energy changes; $S(T)$, $H(T)$, and $C_p(T)$ are unaffected regardless of whether the molecule is linear or non-linear.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **System**: An isolated ideal-gas molecule with $N$ atoms.\n- **Model**: Harmonic approximation for vibrations.\n- **Correct procedure**: The total partition function is constructed from separate contributions of translation ($3$ degrees of freedom), rotation ($3$ for non-linear, $2$ for linear), and vibration ($3N-6$ modes for non-linear, $3N-5$ for linear).\n- **Incorrect procedure (Error)**: All $3N$ modes from the frequency calculation are treated as harmonic vibrations, and the standard translational and rotational contributions are added separately on top of this.\n- **Assumption**: The spurious modes (corresponding to translations and rotations) have small, positive frequencies, $\\nu \\to 0$.\n- **Quantities of interest**: Molar entropy $S(T)$, molar enthalpy $H(T)$, and molar heat capacity at constant pressure $C_p(T)$.\n- **Objective**: Determine the effect of the error on $S(T)$, $H(T)$, and $C_p(T)$, and its dependence on molecular linearity.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and computational chemistry, specifically the rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator (RRHO) approximation for calculating thermodynamic properties. The scenario described is a common and practical error in applying this model.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is clearly defined. The \"correct\" and \"incorrect\" methods are unambiguously described. The consequences of this error can be uniquely determined using the formulas of statistical thermodynamics.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and scientific language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe error described is a case of double-counting degrees of freedom. The translational and rotational motions are accounted for twice: once correctly via the standard ideal-gas translational and rigid-rotor rotational partition functions, and a second time incorrectly as low-frequency harmonic vibrations.\n\nLet the total partition function be $Q$. In the correct treatment, $Q_{\\text{corr}} = Q_{\\text{trans}} Q_{\\text{rot}} Q_{\\text{vib,true}}$, where $Q_{\\text{vib,true}}$ includes only the $3N-6$ (or $3N-5$) genuine vibrational modes.\nIn the incorrect treatment, the vibrational contribution uses all $3N$ frequencies, so $Q_{\\text{vib,all}} = Q_{\\text{vib,true}} Q_{\\text{vib,spur}}$. The term $Q_{\\text{vib,spur}}$ is the partition function for the spurious modes. The total incorrect partition function is $Q_{\\text{err}} = Q_{\\text{trans}} Q_{\\text{rot}} Q_{\\text{vib,all}} = Q_{\\text{corr}} \\cdot Q_{\\text{vib,spur}}$.\n\nThe error in any thermodynamic property will be its contribution from $Q_{\\text{vib,spur}}$. The number of spurious modes, $N_{\\text{spur}}$, is $3$ (translation) + $3$ (rotation) = $6$ for a non-linear molecule, and $3$ (translation) + $2$ (rotation) = $5$ for a linear molecule.\n\nWe must analyze the contribution of a single harmonic oscillator in the low-frequency limit ($\\nu \\to 0$). The partition function for a single harmonic oscillator, with energy levels measured from the ground state, is:\n$$q'_{\\text{vib}}(\\nu) = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-h\\nu/(k_B T)}}$$\nLet $x = \\frac{h\\nu}{k_B T}$. For $\\nu \\to 0$, $x \\to 0$. Using the Taylor expansion $e^{-x} \\approx 1 - x$, we get:\n$$q'_{\\text{vib}}(\\nu) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - (1 - x)} = \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{k_B T}{h\\nu}$$\nThe total contribution from the spurious modes is the product over all $N_{\\text{spur}}$ modes, $Q_{\\text{vib,spur}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{spur}}} q'_{\\text{vib}}(\\nu_i)$.\n\nThe error in thermodynamic properties is the sum of contributions from each spurious mode. Let's find the molar contribution of one such mode.\n\n**Molar Internal Energy ($U$) and Enthalpy ($H$)**\nThe contribution to molar internal energy from one mode is $U_{\\nu} = RT^2 \\frac{d \\ln q'_{\\text{vib}}}{dT}$.\n$$\\ln q'_{\\text{vib}} \\approx \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h\\nu}\\right) = \\ln T + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h\\nu}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d \\ln q'_{\\text{vib}}}{dT} = \\frac{1}{T}$$\nSo, $U_{\\nu} \\approx RT^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) = RT$. This is the classical equipartition result for a harmonic oscillator (receiving $\\frac{1}{2}RT$ each from kinetic and potential energy).\n\nThe total error in molar internal energy is the sum over all spurious modes:\n$$\\Delta U = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{spur}}} U_{\\nu_i} = N_{\\text{spur}} RT$$\nFor an ideal gas, molar enthalpy is $H = U + RT$. The error in enthalpy is $\\Delta H = \\Delta U$, since the $RT$ term is based on the ideal gas law, not the internal partition function.\n$$\\Delta H = N_{\\text{spur}} RT$$\nThus, $H(T)$ is overestimated by:\n- $6RT$ for a non-linear molecule ($N_{\\text{spur}} = 6$).\n- $5RT$ for a linear molecule ($N_{\\text{spur}} = 5$).\n\n**Molar Heat Capacity ($C_p$)**\nThe error in molar heat capacity at constant volume is $\\Delta C_V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta U)}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$.\n$$\\Delta C_V = \\frac{d}{dT}(N_{\\text{spur}} RT) = N_{\\text{spur}} R$$\nFor an ideal gas, $C_p = C_V + R$. The error in $C_p$ is $\\Delta C_p = \\Delta C_V$.\n$$\\Delta C_p = N_{\\text{spur}} R$$\nThus, $C_p(T)$ is overestimated by:\n- $6R$ for a non-linear molecule.\n- $5R$ for a linear molecule.\n\n**Molar Entropy ($S$)**\nThe contribution to molar entropy from one mode is $S_{\\nu} = \\frac{U_{\\nu}}{T} + R \\ln q'_{\\text{vib}}$.\n$$S_{\\nu} \\approx \\frac{RT}{T} + R \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h\\nu}\\right) = R\\left(1 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h\\nu}\\right)\\right)$$\nAs the spurious frequency $\\nu \\to 0$, $\\ln(\\nu) \\to -\\infty$, and thus $S_{\\nu} \\to +\\infty$.\nThe total error $\\Delta S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{spur}}} S_{\\nu_i}$ is a large positive value that grows without bound as the spurious frequencies approach zero. The problem uses angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi\\nu$. The dependence is $S_{\\nu} \\propto -\\ln(\\nu) \\propto -\\ln(\\omega)$, so the scaling is correct. Therefore, the molar entropy $S(T)$ is significantly overestimated.\n\n**Zero-Point Energy (ZPE)**\nThe ZPE of a harmonic oscillator is $\\frac{1}{2}h\\nu$. The incorrect calculation includes the ZPE of the spurious modes in the total energy. The error in the ZPE is:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{ZPE}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{spur}}} \\frac{1}{2}h\\nu_i$$\nSince $\\nu_i > 0$, this is a positive term, meaning the ZPE is spuriously increased.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. The molar entropy $S(T)$ is underestimated; the molar enthalpy $H(T)$ is underestimated by approximately $6RT$ (non-linear) or $5RT$ (linear); and the molar heat capacity $C_p(T)$ is underestimated by approximately $6R$ (non-linear) or $5R$ (linear).**\n    This is incorrect. The error involves adding extra, positive contributions to all thermodynamic functions. Therefore, $S(T)$, $H(T)$, and $C_p(T)$ are all overestimated, not underestimated. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. The molar entropy $S(T)$ is overestimated by an amount that grows without bound as the spurious frequencies approach $0$ (scaling like $-\\ln \\omega$ per mode in the low-frequency harmonic-oscillator limit), the molar enthalpy $H(T)$ is overestimated by approximately $6RT$ (non-linear) or $5RT$ (linear), and the molar heat capacity $C_p(T)$ is overestimated by approximately $6R$ (non-linear) or $5R$ (linear); additionally, the zero-point energy is spuriously increased by $\\tfrac{1}{2}h\\sum \\nu_{\\text{spur}}$.**\n    This statement perfectly matches our derivations.\n    - $S(T)$ is overestimated and diverges as $-\\ln \\omega$. Correct.\n    - $H(T)$ is overestimated by $N_{\\text{spur}}RT$, which is $6RT$ (non-linear) or $5RT$ (linear). Correct.\n    - $C_p(T)$ is overestimated by $N_{\\text{spur}}R$, which is $6R$ (non-linear) or $5R$ (linear). Correct.\n    - ZPE is spuriously increased by $\\frac{1}{2}h\\sum \\nu_{\\text{spur}}$. Correct.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. The molar entropy $S(T)$ is overestimated, but the molar enthalpy $H(T)$ is underestimated by approximately $6RT$ (non-linear) or $5RT$ (linear), and the molar heat capacity $C_p(T)$ is underestimated by approximately $6R$ (non-linear) or $5R$ (linear).**\n    This is incorrect. While it correctly states that entropy is overestimated, it incorrectly claims that enthalpy and heat capacity are underestimated. As derived, they are also overestimated. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Only the zero-point energy changes; $S(T)$, $H(T)$, and $C_p(T)$ are unaffected regardless of whether the molecule is linear or non-linear.**\n    This is incorrect. The error affects the partition function, which in turn affects all thermal properties derived from it, including $S(T)$, $H(T)$, and $C_p(T)$. The effects are substantial, not zero.
