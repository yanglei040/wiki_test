This is a standard procedure in calculus, which involves finding the critical points of the function by setting its first derivative with respect to $r$ equal to zero.\nThe first derivative of $E(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ 4\\left(r^{-12} - r^{-6}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the power rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dr} = 4 \\left( -12r^{-13} - (-6)r^{-7} \\right) = 4 \\left( -12r^{-13} + 6r^{-7} \\right)\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we set this derivative to zero, for $r>0$:\n$$\n4 \\left( -12r^{-13} + 6r^{-7} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $4 \\neq 0$, we must have:\n$$\n-12r^{-13} + 6r^{-7} = 0\n$$\n$$\n6r^{-7} = 12r^{-13}\n$$\nDividing both sides by $6$ and multiplying by $r^{13}$ (which is permissible as the minimum cannot be at $r=0$ where energy is infinite) gives:\n$$\nr^6 = 2\n$$\nSolving for $r$ yields the equilibrium distance, $r^\\star$:\n$$\nr^\\star = 2^{1/6}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a minimum, one must check the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2E}{dr^2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E}{dr^2} = 4 \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( -12r^{-13} + 6r^{-7} \\right) = 4 \\left( (-12)(-13)r^{-14} + (6)(-7)r^{-8} \\right) = 4 \\left( 156r^{-14} - 42r^{-8} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $r = r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$, we have $r^6 = 2$, so $r^8 = r^6 r^2 = 2 \\cdot (2^{1/6})^2 = 2 \\cdot 2^{1/3}$ and $r^{14} = r^{12} r^2 = (r^6)^2 r^2 = 4 \\cdot 2^{1/3}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r=r^\\star} = 4 \\left( \\frac{156}{4 \\cdot 2^{1/3}} - \\frac{42}{2 \\cdot 2^{1/3}} \\right) = 4 \\left( \\frac{39}{2^{1/3}} - \\frac{21}{2^{1/3}} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\cdot 18}{2^{1/3}} = \\frac{72}{2^{1/3}}\n$$\nSince $72 > 0$ and $2^{1/3} > 0$, the second derivative is positive. This confirms that $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$ corresponds to a local minimum. As this is the only critical point for $r>0$, it is the global minimum.\n\nThe value $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}\\sigma$ is an intrinsic property of the Lennard-Jones potential. It represents the single, unique distance at which the repulsive and attractive forces are perfectly balanced. This equilibrium distance does not depend on the initial positions of the atoms. Any geometry optimization algorithm, when applied to a system governed by this potential, will seek to converge to a state where the interatomic distance is $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n\nThe problem provides four initial geometries:\n- Case A: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(0,0,0)$. The initial distance is $r=0$. At this point, the potential energy $E(r)$ is undefined, representing a singularity. Physically, this corresponds to a state of infinite repulsive energy. This is not a stable configuration. The question asks for the geometry that *minimizes* energy, which is located at $r^\\star$, not at the singular point. Any infinitesimal displacement would cause the system to evolve towards the potential well minimum. Thus, the optimized distance is $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n- Case B: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(10^{-12},0,0)$. The initial distance is $r=10^{-12}$, which is on the steep repulsive wall of the potential ($r \\ll r^\\star$). The system will evolve to increase its separation to $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n- Case C: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(3,0,0)$. The initial distance is $r=3$, which is in the attractive region of the potential ($r > r^\\star$). The system will evolve to decrease its separation to $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n- Case D: $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2=(2^{1/6},0,0)$. The initial distance is $r=2^{1/6}$, which is precisely the equilibrium distance $r^\\star$. The system is already at its minimum energy configuration, so the optimized distance is $r^\\star = 2^{1/6}$.\n\nIn all four cases, the geometry that minimizes the potential energy is characterized by the same interatomic distance. The final optimized distance $r^\\star$ is therefore identical for all test cases.

The problem is well-posed, as it requires the minimization of a convex function subject to well-defined constraints, which guarantees a unique solution. The language is objective and the data provided are self-consistent and sufficient for a solution. The values for bond lengths and angles are physically realistic for a water molecule.

Substituting this into the constrained potential energy function yields a significant simplification:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{OH}}-r_{e} = 0.9584 - 0.9584 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the first term of the energy function vanishes:\n$$\nU_{\\text{constrained}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{r}\\big[0^{2}+0^{2}\\big]+\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\theta}\\big(\\theta-\\theta_{e}\\big)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}k_{\\theta}\\big(\\theta-\\theta_{e}\\big)^{2}\n$$\nThe problem now reduces to minimizing this simplified function with respect to $\\theta$. To find the minimum, we compute the first derivative of $U_{\\text{constrained}}(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dU_{\\text{constrained}}}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}k_{\\theta}\\big(\\theta-\\theta_{e}\\big)^{2}\\right] = k_{\\theta}(\\theta-\\theta_{e})\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero provides the condition for an extremum:\n$$\nk_{\\theta}(\\theta-\\theta_{e}) = 0\n$$\nSince the force constant $k_{\\theta}$ is given to be positive ($k_{\\theta} > 0$), the only solution is:\n$$\n\\theta - \\theta_{e} = 0 \\implies \\theta = \\theta_{e}\n$$\nThe second derivative, $\\frac{d^{2}U_{\\text{constrained}}}{d\\theta^{2}} = k_{\\theta}$, is positive, confirming that this extremum is indeed a minimum.\n\nThe updated angle $\\theta^{(1)}$ is therefore the equilibrium angle $\\theta_{e}$.
