A unique minimum is expected to exist.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise, technical, and free of ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and unambiguous. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe geometry of the water molecule is determined by the set of coordinates that minimizes the total potential energy, $U_{total}$. In this model, the total potential energy is the sum of the bond-stretching energy and the non-bonded interaction energy.\n$$ U_{total} = U_{bond} + U_{non-bonded} $$\nLet the two O–H bond lengths be $r_1$ and $r_2$, and let the H–O–H angle be $\\theta$.\n\nThe bond-stretching energy is given by:\n$$ U_{bond} = \\frac{1}{2} k_b (r_1 - r_0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k_b (r_2 - r_0)^2 $$\nwhere $k_b$ is the bond force constant and $r_0$ is the equilibrium bond length. This energy is minimized when $r_1 = r_2 = r_0$. While non-bonded forces might slightly perturb the bond lengths from $r_0$, bond-stretching potentials are typically very \"stiff\" (large $k_b$), so we can assume for the determination of the angle that the bond lengths remain fixed at their minimum-energy value, $r_0$. Thus, $U_{bond}$ can be treated as a constant with a value of $0$.\n\nThe non-bonded energy, $U_{non-bonded}$, according to the problem statement, consists only of the interaction between the two hydrogen atoms (a $1$–$3$ interaction). The O–H non-bonded interactions ($1$–$2$) are explicitly excluded.\n$$ U_{non-bonded} = U_{H-H} $$\nThis interaction is composed of a Lennard-Jones term and a Coulomb term:\n$$ U_{H-H}(r_{HH}) = U_{LJ}(r_{HH}) + U_{Coulomb}(r_{HH}) $$\nwhere $r_{HH}$ is the distance between the two hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe Coulomb term arises from the electrostatic interaction of the two hydrogen atoms, each carrying a charge of $+q$:\n$$ U_{Coulomb}(r_{HH}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q \\cdot q}{r_{HH}} = \\frac{q^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_{HH}} $$\nSince $q>0$, $q^2$ is positive. This term is purely repulsive and monotonically decreases as $r_{HH}$ increases.\n\nThe Lennard-Jones term is:\n$$ U_{LJ}(r_{HH}) = 4\\epsilon_{HH} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{HH}}{r_{HH}}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{HH}}{r_{HH}}\\right)^{6} \\right] $$\nThis term consists of a very strong short-range repulsion (the $r_{HH}^{-12}$ part) and a weaker mid-range attraction (the $r_{HH}^{-6}$ part). For intramolecular $1$–$3$ H–H distances, the separation is typically small enough that the interaction is dominated by the repulsive $r_{HH}^{-12}$ term.\n\nThe total H–H interaction potential, $U_{H-H}$, is therefore dominated by repulsion. Both the electrostatic and the Lennard-Jones steric components contribute to a strong repulsive force between the two hydrogen atoms. A potential that is fundamentally repulsive is a monotonically decreasing function of the interatomic distance $r_{HH}$. Therefore, to minimize $U_{H-H}$, one must maximize the distance $r_{HH}$.\n\nThe distance $r_{HH}$ is a function of the H–O–H angle $\\theta$. Using the law of cosines on the H–O–H isosceles triangle with side length $r_{OH} = r_0$:\n$$ r_{HH}^2 = r_0^2 + r_0^2 - 2 r_0 r_0 \\cos\\theta = 2r_0^2(1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, we find:\n$$ r_{HH} = \\sqrt{4r_0^2\\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2})} = 2r_0 \\left| \\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\right| $$\nFor the physically relevant range of angles $\\theta \\in [0^\\circ, 180^\\circ]$ (or $[0, \\pi]$ radians), $\\sin(\\theta/2)$ is non-negative, so:\n$$ r_{HH}(\\theta) = 2r_0 \\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) $$\nTo maximize $r_{HH}$, we must maximize $\\sin(\\theta/2)$. The maximum value of $\\sin(\\theta/2)$ is $1$, which occurs when $\\theta/2 = 90^\\circ$. This corresponds to an angle of $\\theta = 180^\\circ$.\n\nSince the total energy's dependence on angle, $U_{total}(\\theta)$, is entirely through the repulsive $U_{H-H}(r_{HH}(\\theta))$ term, minimizing the total energy requires maximizing $r_{HH}$, which in turn requires setting $\\theta = 180^\\circ$. The crucial element of the problem is the explicit absence of a harmonic angle-bending term, which in a more realistic-force field would provide a restoring force to keep the angle near its experimental value. Without it, the repulsive non-bonded forces are unopposed.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n-   **A) $104.5^\\circ$**: This is the experimental angle for water. This result is obtained from models that include a specific angle-bending potential of the form $U_{angle} = \\frac{1}{2} k_\\theta (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2$ where $\\theta_0$ is parameterized to be near $104.5^\\circ$. The problem explicitly excludes this term. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n-   **B) $0^\\circ$**: An angle of $\\theta = 0^\\circ$ would imply $r_{HH}=0$. This would cause the repulsive Lennard-Jones and Coulomb energy terms to become infinite. This represents the configuration of maximum energy, not minimum. This option is patently absurd. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n-   **C) $180^\\circ$**: An angle of $\\theta = 180^\\circ$ maximizes the distance $r_{HH}$ between the two hydrogen atoms. As established, the interaction potential $U_{H-H}$ is repulsive for all relevant distances. Maximizing the separation minimizes this repulsive energy. Since this is the only angle-dependent term in the potential, this configuration corresponds to the global energy minimum for the given model. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n-   **D) Undetermined; any angle has the same energy**: This is false. The total energy depends on the H–H non-bonded interaction, which is a function of the H–H distance, $r_{HH}$. Since $r_{HH}$ is a function of the angle $\\theta$, the total energy is also a function of $\\theta$. The energy is not constant for all angles. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2458473"}, {"introduction": "Torsional potentials, which govern rotation around chemical bonds, are among the most complex and important terms in a force field.

In the context of the dihedral potential for butane's central $\\mathrm{C-C}$ bond, each term has a physical correspondence to the interactions governing the molecule's conformational energetics.\n\n-   **The $V_1$ Term ($n=1$):** This term has a periodicity of $360^\\circ$. It governs the energy difference between the fully eclipsed syn-periplanar conformation ($\\phi=0^\\circ$) and the staggered anti-periplanar conformation ($\\phi=180^\\circ$). The primary contribution to this term is the strong steric repulsion (van der Waals repulsion) between the two bulky terminal methyl groups. This interaction is maximal at $\\phi=0^\\circ$ and minimal at $\\phi=180^\\circ$. A positive $V_1$ coefficient correctly makes the syn conformation a high-energy state and the anti conformation a low-energy state.\n\n-   **The $V_2$ Term ($n=2$):** This term has a periodicity of $180^\\circ$ and helps to describe the energy difference between the eclipsed and staggered conformations more generally. However, its main role is distinguishing between the two types of staggered conformers (anti at $180^\\circ$ vs. gauche at $\\pm 60^\\circ$) and the two principal types of eclipsed conformers (at $0^\\circ$ vs. $\\pm 120^\\circ$). This term can be related to electronic effects such as hyperconjugation, which may stabilize perpendicular arrangements of bonds, but its interpretation is less direct than for $V_1$ and $V_3$.\n\n-   **The $V_3$ Term ($n=3$):** This term has a periodicity of $120^\\circ$, reflecting the threefold symmetry of the $\\mathrm{sp^3-sp^3}$ single bond. This is the fundamental, 'ethane-like' component of the rotational barrier. It represents the intrinsic preference for staggered conformations (e.g., $\\phi = 60^\\circ, 180^\\circ, 300^\\circ$) over eclipsed conformations (e.g., $\\phi = 0^\\circ, 120^\\circ, 240^\\circ$). This preference arises primarily from Pauli repulsion (steric hindrance) between the electron clouds of the bonds on the two central carbon atoms. A positive $V_3$ coefficient ensures that all staggered forms are at lower energy than all eclipsed forms, creating the characteristic three-fold barrier profile.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fits torsional potential parameters V_n to given energy scans for butane.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = {\n        \"angles_deg\": [\n            0.0, 30.0, 60.0, 90.0, 120.0, 150.0, 180.0, \n            210.0, 240.0, 270.0, 300.0, 330.0\n        ],\n        \"A\": {\n            \"energies\": [\n                3.500, 1.500, -0.250, 2.250, 4.250, 1.500, -1.000, \n                1.500, 4.250, 2.250, -0.250, 1.500\n            ]\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"energies\": [\n                0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000,\n                0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000\n            ]\n        },\n        \"C\": {\n            \"energies\": [\n                2.000, 1.000, 0.000, 1.000, 2.000, 1.000, 0.000,\n                1.000, 2.000, 1.000, 0.000, 1.000\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Extract angle grid and convert to radians\n    phi_deg = np.array(test_cases[\"angles_deg\"])\n    phi_rad = np.deg2rad(phi_deg)\n\n    # --- Construct the design matrix A ---\n    # The model is V(phi) = sum_{n=1 to 3} V_n * f_n(phi)\n    # where f_n(phi) = 0.5 * (1 + cos(n*phi))\n    # The columns of A are the basis functions f_n evaluated at each angle phi_k.\n    f1 = 0.5 * (1 + np.cos(1 * phi_rad))\n    f2 = 0.5 * (1 + np.cos(2 * phi_rad))\n    f3 = 0.5 * (1 + np.cos(3 * phi_rad))\n    \n    # Design matrix A (size 12x3)\n    A = np.vstack([f1, f2, f3]).T\n\n    results = []\n    # Loop through the cases to fit\n    for case_id in [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]:\n        # Energy vector E (size 12x1)\n        E = np.array(test_cases[case_id][\"energies\"])\n        \n        # Solve the linear least squares problem A*V = E for V=[V1, V2, V3]\n        # np.linalg.lstsq returns a tuple; the first element is the solution vector.\n        V, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(A, E, rcond=None)\n        \n        results.append(V)\n\n    # --- Format the output as specified ---\n    # Example format: [[v1A,v2A,v3A],[v1B,v2B,v3B],[v1C,v2C,v3C]]\n    # with each value rounded to three decimal places.\n    \n    outer_list = []\n    for res in results:\n        # Format each coefficient to 3 decimal places\n        inner_list_str = \",\".join([f\"{x:.3f}\" for x in res])\n        outer_list.append(f\"[{inner_list_str}]\")\n        \n    final_output_string = f\"[{','.join(outer_list)}]\"\n    \n    print(final_output_string)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2458507"}]}
