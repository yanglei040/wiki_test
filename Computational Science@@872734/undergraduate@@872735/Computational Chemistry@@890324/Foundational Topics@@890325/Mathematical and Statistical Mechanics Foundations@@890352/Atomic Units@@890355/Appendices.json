For hydrogen, $Z=1$. The Hamiltonian simplifies to a one-body problem for the electron at position $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\nabla^2 - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n$$\nIn atomic units, we set $m_{e}=1$, $e=1$, $\\hbar=1$, and $4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}=1$. The Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{a.u.}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nThe corresponding time-independent Schrödinger equation is $\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{a.u.}} \\psi = E_{\\mathrm{a.u.}} \\psi$.

The factor of $1/2$ is present in the kinetic energy operator, $-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A:** In atomic units the nonrelativistic hydrogen Hamiltonian is such that the kinetic energy operator carries a coefficient $1/2$ originating from $p^{2}/(2m_{e})$ with $m_{e}=1$ and $\\hbar=1$, and solving the stationary Schrödinger equation in the Coulomb potential $-1/r$ yields $E_{n}=-1/(2n^{2})\\,E_{\\mathrm{h}}$, so for $n=1$ the factor $1/2$ appears directly.\nThis statement is a precise summary of the derivation performed above. The kinetic energy operator $\\hat{T} = \\hat{p}^2 / (2m_e)$ becomes $-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\nabla^2$. In atomic units ($\\hbar=1$, $m_e=1$), this is $-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2$. The potential energy operator $\\hat{V} = -e^2/(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r)$ becomes $-1/r$. The solution to the Schrödinger equation with the resulting Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - 1/r$ indeed gives the energy eigenvalues $E_n = -1/(2n^2)$. For the ground state ($n=1$), this yields $E_1 = -1/2$ in units of $E_{\\mathrm{h}}$. This explanation is fundamentally correct and follows directly from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:** For a potential proportional to $1/r$, the quantum virial theorem gives $2\\langle T\\rangle+\\langle V\\rangle=0$, so the total energy satisfies $E=\\langle T\\rangle+\\langle V\\rangle=\\langle V\\rangle/2$, implying that bound-state energies are negative and exactly half the average potential energy. With the Coulomb scale set by $E_{\\mathrm{h}}$, this yields $E_{1}=-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,E_{\\mathrm{h}}$.\nThe quantum virial theorem for a stationary state in a potential $V(r) \\propto r^k$ states that $2\\langle T \\rangle = k \\langle V \\rangle$. For the Coulomb potential, $V(r) \\propto r^{-1}$, so $k=-1$. The theorem gives $2\\langle T \\rangle = -\\langle V \\rangle$, or $2\\langle T \\rangle + \\langle V \\rangle = 0$. The total energy is the sum of the expectation values, $E = \\langle T \\rangle + \\langle V \\rangle$. Using the virial relation, we can write $E = (-\\frac{1}{2}\\langle V \\rangle) + \\langle V \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle V \\rangle$. Also, $E = \\langle T \\rangle + (-2\\langle T \\rangle) = -\\langle T \\rangle$. Since kinetic energy $\\langle T \\rangle$ must be positive for a non-trivial state, the total energy $E$ for any bound state must be negative. The relation $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle V \\rangle$ shows the total energy is exactly half the average potential energy. For the ground state of hydrogen in atomic units, the expectation value of the potential is $\\langle V \\rangle = \\langle -1/r \\rangle = -1 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}$. Therefore, the ground-state energy must be $E_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(-1 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}) = -0.5 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}$. This provides a deep and general physical reason for the factor of $1/2$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option C:** The factor $1/2$ reflects the twofold spin degeneracy of the electron, which halves the energy of the lowest state when spin is included.\nThis statement is incorrect. The nonrelativistic Hamiltonian as stated is spin-independent. Spin introduces a degeneracy to the energy levels, meaning the ground state corresponds to two distinct quantum states (spin up and spin down), but it does not alter the energy value of these states. Degeneracy concerns the number of states at a given energy, not the energy value itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:** The factor $1/2$ arises only after including relativistic fine-structure corrections, which reduce the nonrelativistic ground-state energy by a factor of $1/2$.\nThis is fundamentally wrong. The result $E_1 = -0.5 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}$ is the exact solution to the *nonrelativistic* Schrödinger equation. Relativistic corrections are small perturbations, on the order of $\\alpha^2 \\approx (1/137)^2$, that slightly shift this energy. They do not introduce a factor of $1/2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E:** The factor $1/2$ is an artifact of taking the proton to be infinitely massive; using the exact reduced mass would make the ground-state energy exactly $-1\\,E_{\\mathrm{h}}$.\nThis is incorrect. The use of the reduced mass $\\mu = \\frac{m_e m_p}{m_e + m_p}$ instead of $m_e$ serves to correct for the finite mass of the proton. The energy eigenvalues are proportional to the mass term, so $E_n = -\\frac{\\mu}{m_e} \\frac{1}{2n^2} E_{\\mathrm{h}}$. Since $\\mu  m_e$, the magnitude of the ground state energy becomes slightly *smaller* than $0.5 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}$. The correction factor $\\mu/m_e \\approx 0.99945$, which is close to $1$. The factor of $1/2$ persists, and the statement that the energy would become $-1 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}$ is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option F:** By definition, the Hartree energy $E_{\\mathrm{h}}$ is exactly twice the Rydberg energy $E_{\\mathrm{Ry}}$, while the hydrogen ground-state energy equals $-E_{\\mathrm{Ry}}$, so $E_{1}=-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,E_{\\mathrm{h}}$ and the factor $1/2$ is definitional via $E_{\\mathrm{h}}=2E_{\\mathrm{Ry}}$.\nThis provides an explanation from the perspective of energy unit definitions. The Rydberg unit of energy, $E_{\\mathrm{Ry}}$, is historically defined as the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom (in the infinite proton mass limit). From our derivation, the ground state energy is $E_1 = -0.5 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}$. The ionization energy is thus $-E_1 = 0.5 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}$. By definition, this is $E_{\\mathrm{Ry}} = 0.5 \\, E_{\\mathrm{h}}$, which implies $E_{\\mathrm{h}} = 2 E_{\\mathrm{Ry}}$. The statement that the hydrogen ground-state energy is $-E_{\\mathrm{Ry}}$ is true by this definition. Substituting $E_{\\mathrm{Ry}} = \\frac{1}{2}E_{\\mathrm{h}}$ into $E_1 = -E_{\\mathrm{Ry}}$ yields $E_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}E_{\\mathrm{h}}$. This framing is entirely correct; it accounts for the factor of $1/2$ as a consequence of the definitional relationship between the two most common atomic energy units.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nIn conclusion, statements A, B, and F offer three distinct, yet equally valid, explanations for the factor of $1/2$. Statement A is a direct mathematical derivation, B is an explanation from a general physical principle (the virial theorem), and F is an explanation based on the conventional definitions of energy units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABF}$$", "id": "2450239"}]}
