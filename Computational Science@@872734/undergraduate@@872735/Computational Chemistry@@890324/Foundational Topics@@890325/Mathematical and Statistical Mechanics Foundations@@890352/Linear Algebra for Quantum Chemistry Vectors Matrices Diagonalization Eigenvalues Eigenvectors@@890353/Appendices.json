It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze a two-level quantum system described by the Hamiltonian operator represented in an orthonormal basis of donor ($|D\\rangle$) and acceptor ($|A\\rangle$) orbitals by the matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nE_{D} & V \\\\\nV & E_{A}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe given parameters are the donor orbital energy $E_{D} = -7.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, the acceptor orbital energy $E_{A} = -6.80\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and the coupling element $V = -0.40\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian, which represent the molecular orbital (MO) energies, are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{H} - E\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix}\nE_{D} - E & V \\\\\nV & E_{A} - E\n\\end{pmatrix} = (E_{D} - E)(E_{A} - E) - V^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the energy $E$:\n$$\nE^2 - (E_{D} + E_{A})E + (E_{D}E_{A} - V^2) = 0\n$$\nThe solutions for the two eigenvalues, which we denote $E_{+}$ and $E_{-}$, are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\nE_{\\pm} = \\frac{E_{D} + E_{A}}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(E_{D} - E_{A})^2 + 4V^2}\n$$\nThe problem defines the energy splitting $\\Delta E$ as the difference between the upper and lower MO energies, $E_{+}$ and $E_{-}$, respectively.\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{+} - E_{-} = \\sqrt{(E_{D} - E_{A})^2 + 4V^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$E_{D} - E_{A} = -7.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} - (-6.80\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = -0.70\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n$4V^2 = 4(-0.40\\,\\mathrm{eV})^2 = 4(0.16\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2) = 0.64\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2$.\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\sqrt{(-0.70\\,\\mathrm{eV})^2 + 0.64\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2} = \\sqrt{0.49\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2 + 0.64\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2} = \\sqrt{1.13}\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.063\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis is the energy splitting between the two MOs.\n\nNext, we determine the normalized eigenvectors. An elegant method is to use a rotation matrix that diagonalizes $\\mathbf{H}$. The eigenvectors are the columns of this rotation matrix. The angle of rotation, $\\theta$, is determined by the condition that the off-diagonal elements of the rotated Hamiltonian become zero. This condition leads to the relation:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2V}{E_{D} - E_{A}}\n$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2(-0.40)}{-7.50 - (-6.80)} = \\frac{-0.80}{-0.70} = \\frac{8}{7}\n$$\nThe sign of $E_D - E_A$ is negative, and since $\\tan(2\\theta)$ is positive, we can deduce which eigenvalue corresponds to which eigenvector.
