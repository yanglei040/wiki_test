The task is to verify the atom balance for a given set of biochemical reactions with respect to the elements Carbon ($C$), Nitrogen ($N$), and Phosphorus ($P$). The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique and verifiable solution.\n\nThe core principle is the law of conservation of mass, which dictates that in a closed system, the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products. For a chemical reaction, this implies that the number of atoms of each element must be conserved.\n\nThe problem formalizes this principle using vector algebra. Each metabolite, denoted by a string name, is associated with a composition vector of the form $\\mathbf{v} = (C, N, P)$, where $C$, $N$, and $P$ are non-negative integer counts of the respective atoms.\n\nA reaction is defined by a multiset of reactants, $\\{(a_i, m_i)\\}_{i=1}^{I}$, and a multiset of products, $\\{(b_j, n_j)\\}_{j=1}^{J}$. Here, $m_i$ and $n_j$ are metabolite identifiers, and $a_i$ and $b_j$ are their corresponding positive integer stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nTo check for balance, we compute a total atom count vector for the reactants, $\\mathbf{R}$, and one for the products, $\\mathbf{P}$. These are defined as follows:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R} = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} a_i \\mathbf{v}_{m_i}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} b_j \\mathbf{v}_{n_j}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}_{m_i}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{n_j}$ are the composition vectors for metabolites $m_i$ and $n_j$, respectively. The vector addition and scalar multiplication are performed component-wise. A reaction is considered atom-balanced if and only if the reactant sum vector equals the product sum vector, i.e., $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{P}$.\n\nThe algorithm to solve this problem is a direct implementation of this verification procedure.\n\n$1$. **Data Storage**: First, we must create a data structure, such as a dictionary or a hash map, to store the given mapping from metabolite names to their $(C, N, P)$ composition vectors. For computational efficiency, these vectors can be represented as NumPy arrays. The test cases, each containing a list of reactions, are also stored in a suitable data structure, like a list of lists.\n\n$2$. **Iterative Processing**: The algorithm must process each test case independently. A main loop iterates through the provided test suite. For each test case, an empty list is initialized to collect the indices of any imbalanced reactions found.\n\n$3$. **Reaction Verification**: Inside the main loop, a nested loop iterates through each reaction of the current test case, keeping track of its $0$-based index, let's call it $k$. For each reaction:\n    a. Two $3$-element vectors, $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{sum}}$ and $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sum}}$, are initialized to the zero vector $(0, 0, 0)$.\n    b. The algorithm iterates through the reactant multiset. For each reactant pair $(a_i, m_i)$, it retrieves the composition vector $\\mathbf{v}_{m_i}$ from the data map. This vector is multiplied by its stoichiometric coefficient $a_i$, and the result is added to $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{sum}}$.\n    c. A similar process is performed for the product multiset. For each product pair $(b_j, n_j)$, the vector $b_j \\mathbf{v}_{n_j}$ is calculated and added to $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sum}}$.\n    d. After processing all reactants and products, the two sum vectors, $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{sum}}$ and $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{sum}}$, are compared. If they are not component-wise equal, the reaction is imbalanced. In this case, its index $k$ is added to the list of imbalanced indices for the current test case.\n\n$4$. **Output Formulation**: After all reactions in all test cases have been analyzed, the result is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices of imbalanced reactions for the corresponding test case. This final data structure is then formatted into a string matching standard Python list representation and printed.

There are no subjective or opinion-based statements. The rules for atom mapping are explicit and unambiguous.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidity flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, feasible, and well-structured.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\nSolution Derivation\nThe task is to implement a function, let us call it $f(g)$, which maps an initial glucose carbon index $g$ to a final pyruvate carbon index $p$. The domain of valid inputs is $g \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. For any $g$ outside this set, the function must return $-1$.\n\nThe pathway is composed of distinct stages, each corresponding to a mathematical mapping. We will compose these mappings to find the final result.\n\n1.  **Input Validation**: The first step is to check if the input $g$ is valid.\n    $$\n    f(g) = -1 \\quad \\text{if } g \\notin \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Aldolase Cleavage**: The glucose ($6$C) derivative, fructose-$1,6$-bisphosphate, is cleaved into two triose phosphates ($3$C). The fate of the labeled carbon depends on its initial position.\n    - If $g \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the atom becomes part of the dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) molecule. The local index within this $3$-carbon fragment is preserved. Let us denote the local index as $i_{local}$.\n      $$\n      i_{local} = g \\quad \\text{for } g \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n      $$\n    - If $g \\in \\{4, 5, 6\\}$, the atom becomes part of the glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate (GAP) molecule. The local index is relative to the start of this fragment (carbon $4$ of glucose).\n      $$\n      i_{local} = g - 3 \\quad \\text{for } g \\in \\{4, 5, 6\\}\n      $$\n\n3.  **Triose Phosphate Isomerase (TPI) Action**: All carbon that enters the lower part of glycolysis must be in the form of GAP. The DHAP formed from carbons $1,2,3$ of glucose is isomerized to GAP. This step involves a re-ordering of carbons. The GAP formed directly from carbons $4,5,6$ of glucose proceeds without isomerization. Let us define the index in the unified GAP pool as $i_{GAP}$.\n    - For the atom originating from DHAP ($g \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$), we apply the TPI mapping $M_{TPI}$ to its local index $i_{local}$:\n      $$\n      M_{TPI}(i) =\n      \\begin{cases}\n        3  \\text{if } i = 1 \\\\\n        2  \\text{if } i = 2 \\\\\n        1  \\text{if } i = 3\n      \\end{cases}\n      $$\n      So, for $g \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the index in the resulting GAP molecule is:\n      $$\n      i_{GAP} = M_{TPI}(i_{local}) = M_{TPI}(g)\n      $$\n    - For the atom originating from the first GAP molecule ($g \\in \\{4, 5, 6\\}$), there is no isomerization. The index is unchanged.\n      $$\n      i_{GAP} = i_{local} = g - 3\n      $$\n\n4.  **Lower Glycolysis (GAP to Pyruvate)**: The final sequence of reactions from GAP to pyruvate preserves the carbon backbone order. This corresponds to an identity mapping, $M_{final}(i) = i$. The final pyruvate carbon index $p$ is therefore equal to the index $i_{GAP}$.\n    $$\n    p = i_{GAP}\n    $$\n\nBy combining these steps, we can construct the complete function $f(g)$:\n- **Case 1**: $g \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ (DHAP branch)\n  $p = f(g) = M_{TPI}(g)$. This yields:\n  - $f(1) = M_{TPI}(1) = 3$\n  - $f(2) = M_{TPI}(2) = 2$\n  - $f(3) = M_{TPI}(3) = 1$\n- **Case 2**: $g \\in \\{4, 5, 6\\}$ (GAP branch)\n  $p = f(g) = g - 3$.

Let the network be a directed, enzyme-labeled reaction graph $G = (V,R)$ where $V = \\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}$ is a finite set of metabolites and $R \\subseteq V \\times V \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ is a finite set of directed reactions. Each reaction is a triple $(u,v,e)$ indicating a directed conversion from metabolite $u$ to metabolite $v$ catalyzed by an enzyme identifier $e \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. For connectivity, consider the underlying undirected simple graph $G^\\ast = (V,E^\\ast)$ defined as follows: for any unordered pair $\\{u,v\\} \\subseteq V$ with $u \\ne v$, the undirected edge $\\{u,v\\}$ is in $E^\\ast$ if and only if there exists at least one reaction $(u,v,e) \\in R$ or $(v,u,e) \\in R$. Multiple reactions and directions between the same metabolites are collapsed to a single undirected edge in $E^\\ast$; however, each undirected edge $\\{u,v\\}$ carries the multiset of enzyme identifiers that appear on any directed reaction between $u$ and $v$ in $R$.\n\nFor any single enzyme identifier $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, define the enzyme-removed reaction set $R^{(-x)} = \\{(u,v,e) \\in R \\mid e \\ne x\\}$ and the corresponding underlying undirected simple graph $G^{\\ast(-x)} = (V,E^{\\ast(-x)})$, where $\\{u,v\\} \\in E^{\\ast(-x)}$ if and only if there exists at least one reaction between $u$ and $v$ in $R^{(-x)}$.

Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a list of lists, using standard Python list formatting.

It is scientifically sound, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe central task is to identify \"chokepoint\" enzymes within a given metabolic network. The definition provided is formal and precise: an enzyme $x$ is a chokepoint if its removal from the network increases the number of connected components in the underlying undirected graph representation of the metabolism. This is fundamentally a problem of identifying critical edges, or sets of edges, that act as bridges connecting otherwise disjoint parts of the network. An edge $\\{u,v\\}$ in the underlying graph is sustained by the multiset of all enzymes catalyzing reactions between metabolites $u$ and $v$. The removal of a single enzyme $x$ will only sever the connection between $u$ and $v$ if $x$ is the *sole* enzyme responsible for all reactions between them.\n\nThe algorithm to solve this problem is deductive and systematic. It comprises the following steps:\n\n1.  **Establish Baseline Connectivity**: First, we must characterize the initial state of the network. We construct the full underlying undirected graph, denoted as $G^\\ast = (V, E^\\ast)$. The set of vertices $V$ is given as $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. An undirected edge $\\{u,v\\}$ exists in $E^\\ast$ if there is at least one reaction in the set $R$ connecting metabolites $u$ and $v$ in either direction. After constructing $G^\\ast$, we compute its number of connected components, $C(G^\\ast)$. This value serves as our baseline reference for connectivity. The computation of connected components is a standard procedure in graph theory, typically performed using a graph traversal algorithm such as a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n\n2.  **Iterative Perturbation and Evaluation**: We must test the criticality of each enzyme individually. We begin by identifying the complete set of unique enzyme identifiers present in the given reaction set $R$. Let this set be $\\mathcal{E}$. For each unique enzyme $x \\in \\mathcal{E}$, we perform a simulation of its removal.\n\n    a.  **Construct the Perturbed Graph**: We define a new reaction set, $R^{(-x)}$, which includes all reactions from $R$ except those catalyzed by enzyme $x$. From this reduced set of reactions, we construct a new underlying undirected graph, $G^{\\ast(-x)} = (V, E^{\\ast(-x)})$. An edge $\\{u,v\\}$ exists in $E^{\\ast(-x)}$ if and only if there remains at least one reaction between $u$ and $v$ in $R^{(-x)}$.\n\n    b.  **Compute Perturbed Connectivity**: Using the same component-counting algorithm, we calculate the number of connected components in the perturbed graph, $C(G^{\\ast(-x)})$.\n\n    c.  **Identify Chokepoints**: The defining condition for a chokepoint is applied. If the number of components in the perturbed graph is strictly greater than in the original graph, i.e., if $C(G^{\\ast(-x)})  C(G^\\ast)$, then the enzyme $x$ is classified as a chokepoint.\n\n3.  **Aggregate and Report Results**: The enzymes identified as chokepoints in the previous step are collected for each test case. As per the problem specification, this set of enzyme identifiers must be presented as a list sorted in strictly increasing order.\n\nFor the implementation, a graph can be represented using an adjacency list. However, given the specified computational environment, it is more direct to construct a sparse matrix representation of the graph and utilize the `scipy.sparse.csgraph.connected_components` function. This function efficiently determines the number of connected components in a graph represented by its adjacency matrix, thereby streamlining the implementation of steps $1$ and $2b$. The overall logic remains identical. For each test case, we first compute the number of components for the full graph, then iterate through each unique enzyme, re-compute the components for the graph lacking that enzyme's reactions, and compare the counts to identify chokepoints.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix\nfrom scipy.sparse.csgraph import connected_components\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chokepoint enzyme identification problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test case 1\n        {\n            \"N\": 5,\n            \"R\": [(1, 2, 10), (2, 3, 20), (3, 2, 21), (3, 4, 30), (4, 5, 40)]\n        },\n        # Test case 2\n        {\n            \"N\": 4,\n            \"R\": [(1, 2, 1), (3, 4, 2)]\n        },\n        # Test case 3\n        {\n            \"N\": 4,\n            \"R\": [(1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 6), (3, 1, 7), (1, 4, 8)]\n        },\n        # Test case 4\n        {\n            \"N\": 6,\n            \"R\": [(1, 2, 11), (2, 3, 12), (3, 1, 13), (3, 4, 99), (4, 5, 99), (5, 6, 14)]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[\"N\"]\n        R = case[\"R\"]\n        chokepoints = find_chokepoints(N, R)\n        results.append(chokepoints)\n\n    # Print the final results in standard list format.\n    print(results)\n\ndef count_components(num_nodes, reactions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of connected components in the undirected graph\n    derived from a set of reactions.\n    \n    Args:\n        num_nodes (int): The number of metabolites (nodes) in the graph, N.\n        reactions (list): A list of reaction triples (u, v, e).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of connected components.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not reactions:\n        return num_nodes\n\n    row_indices = []\n    col_indices = []\n\n    for u, v, _ in reactions:\n        # Using 0-based indexing for matrix\n        row_indices.append(u - 1)\n        col_indices.append(v - 1)\n\n    # An undirected graph's adjacency matrix is symmetric.\n    # We add edges in both directions.\n    full_row = row_indices + col_indices\n    full_col = col_indices + row_indices\n    data = np.ones(len(full_row), dtype=int)\n\n    # Create a compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix representation of the graph.\n    graph_matrix = csr_matrix((data, (full_row, full_col)), shape=(num_nodes, num_nodes))\n    \n    # Use SciPy to find connected components.\n    n_components, _ = connected_components(csgraph=graph_matrix, directed=False, return_labels=True)\n    \n    return n_components\n\ndef find_chokepoints(N, R):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies chokepoint enzymes for a given metabolic network.\n    \n    Args:\n        N (int): The number of metabolites.\n        R (list): The list of reactions.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted list of chokepoint enzyme identifiers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not R:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the set of all unique enzyme identifiers\n    unique_enzymes = sorted(list(set(e for _, _, e in R)))\n\n    # Calculate the number of connected components in the original graph G*\n    base_components = count_components(N, R)\n\n    chokepoints = []\n    for enzyme_to_remove in unique_enzymes:\n        # Construct the enzyme-removed reaction set R^(-x)\n        r_removed = [(u, v, e) for u, v, e in R if e != enzyme_to_remove]\n        \n        # Calculate components in the perturbed graph G*(-x)\n        num_components_removed = count_components(N, r_removed)\n        \n        # Check the chokepoint condition\n        if num_components_removed > base_components:\n            chokepoints.append(enzyme_to_remove)\n            \n    return chokepoints\n\n# Execute the main function\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2375339"}]}
