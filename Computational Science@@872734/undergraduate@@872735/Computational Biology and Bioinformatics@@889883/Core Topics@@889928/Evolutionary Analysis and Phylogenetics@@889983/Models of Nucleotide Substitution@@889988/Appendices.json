Assume the process is stationary with the uniform stationary distribution $\\pi_i = \\frac{1}{4}$ for all $i$.\n\nConsider two homologous DNA sequences that have evolved from a common ancestor under the JC model along a path of total elapsed time $\\tau > 0$ (that is, the sum of the branch durations separating the two sequences is $\\tau$). Let $p$ denote the expected Hamming fraction of nucleotide differences between the two sequences at a homologous site under this model. Define the Jukes–Cantor evolutionary distance $d$ to be the expected number of substitutions per site along the path connecting the two sequences. Under the JC model, the average instantaneous substitution rate per site at stationarity is $\\mu = \\sum_{i} \\pi_i \\left(-Q_{ii}\\right)$, and thus $d = \\mu \\,\\tau$.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and the rate matrix $Q_{JC}$, derive a closed-form expression for $d$ as a function of $p$ only, eliminating $\\alpha$ and $\\tau$. Express your final result as a single analytic expression in terms of $p$ only. No units are required.", "solution": "The objective is to derive an expression for the evolutionary distance $d$ in terms of the observed proportion of differing sites $p$. This requires establishing a relationship between each of these quantities and the underlying parameters of the JC model, which are the substitution rate parameter $\\alpha$ and the total time $\\tau$.\n\nFirst, we determine the average rate of substitution per site, $\\mu$. By definition, $\\mu = \\sum_{i} \\pi_i (-Q_{ii})$.\nThe problem provides the stationary distribution $\\pi_i = \\frac{1}{4}$ for all $4$ nucleotide states $i \\in \\{A, C, G, T\\}$.\nThe diagonal elements of the rate matrix are given as $Q_{ii} = -3\\alpha$.\nTherefore, the rate $\\mu$ is:\n$$ \\mu = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,C,G,T\\}} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) (-(-3\\alpha)) = 4 \\times \\frac{3\\alpha}{4} = 3\\alpha $$\nThe evolutionary distance $d$, defined as the expected number of substitutions per site, is given by $d = \\mu \\tau$. Substituting the expression for $\\mu$, we have:\n$$ d = 3\\alpha\\tau $$\n\nNext, we must find an expression for $p$, the expected fraction of nucleotide differences. For a time-reversible Markov model such as JC, the probability of observing a difference between two sequences separated by a total branch length of $\\tau$ is equivalent to the probability that a single sequence will change its state over a time interval $\\tau$. Let us assume the process starts at equilibrium, meaning the initial nucleotide is drawn from the stationary distribution $\\pi$. The probability of a difference is then the probability of starting in any state $i$ and ending in any other state $j \\neq i$ after time $\\tau$.\n$$ p = \\sum_{i} \\pi_i \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau) \\right) $$\nDue to the symmetry of the JC model, the probability of changing from state $i$ to any other state is independent of the starting state $i$. That is, $\\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau)$ is the same for all $i$. Since $\\sum_i \\pi_i = 1$, the expression for $p$ simplifies to:\n$$ p = \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau) = 1 - P_{ii}(\\tau) $$\nfor any arbitrarily chosen state $i$.\n\nWe must now determine the transition probability $P_{ii}(\\tau)$. The transition matrix $P(t)$ is the solution to the master equation $\\frac{d P(t)}{dt} = P(t) Q_{JC}$ with initial condition $P(0) = I$, the identity matrix. It is simpler to solve for the probability vector. Let $p_k(t)$ be the probability of being in state $k$ at time $t$. Consider a sequence starting in state $i$ at $t=0$. The change in probability of remaining in state $i$ is described by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = \\sum_{k} p_k(t) Q_{ki} $$\nUsing the specific entries of the JC matrix, with $p_i(0)=1$ and $p_j(0)=0$ for $j \\neq i$:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = p_i(t) Q_{ii} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) Q_{ji} = p_i(t)(-3\\alpha) + \\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) \\alpha $$\nSince the probabilities must sum to unity, $\\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) = 1 - p_i(t)$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = -3\\alpha p_i(t) + \\alpha(1 - p_i(t)) = \\alpha - 4\\alpha p_i(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it using an integrating factor or by separation of variables. Let us rearrange to find the solution:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i}{dt} + 4\\alpha p_i = \\alpha $$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $C \\exp(-4\\alpha t)$, and a particular solution. For the particular solution, we try a constant $p_i = K$, which gives $4\\alpha K = \\alpha$, so $K = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe general solution is $p_i(t) = \\frac{1}{4} + C \\exp(-4\\alpha t)$.\nWe apply the initial condition $p_i(0) = 1$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{1}{4} + C \\exp(0) \\implies C = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThus, the probability of remaining in the same state after time $t$ is:\n$$ P_{ii}(t) = p_i(t) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha t) $$\nNow we can compute $p$ by substituting $t=\\tau$:\n$$ p = 1 - P_{ii}(\\tau) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) \\right) = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) $$\n$$ p = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) \\right) $$\n\nWe have established two relations:\n1. $d = 3\\alpha \\tau$\n2. $p = \\frac{3}{4} (1 - \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau))$\n\nOur goal is to express $d$ as a function of $p$.

Under the specified scaling convention, the rate matrix $Q$ is scaled such that the average rate of substitution $\\mu = -\\sum_{i} \\pi_i Q_{ii} = 1$. The branch length is then equivalent to the time parameter, $t$, so $d_{true} = t$.\n\nFirst, we define the true model, K$80$. The rate of substitution from any nucleotide is given by the sum of rates to the other three nucleotides. For a purine (A or G), this is one transition (rate $\\alpha$) and two transversions (rate $\\beta$). Thus, the total rate of leaving a state is $\\alpha + 2\\beta$. With equal stationary frequencies $\\pi_i = 1/4$, the average rate of substitution is $\\mu_{K80} = \\sum_i \\pi_i (\\alpha + 2\\beta) = \\alpha + 2\\beta$.\nThe scaling condition implies $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 1$.\nGiven $R = \\alpha/\\beta = 10$, we have $\\alpha = 10\\beta$. Substituting this into the scaling equation gives:\n$$10\\beta + 2\\beta = 1 \\implies 12\\beta = 1 \\implies \\beta = \\frac{1}{12}$$\nAnd consequently, $\\alpha = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nFor the K$80$ model with equal base frequencies, the probability that two homologous sites are identical after a time $t$ is:\n$$P_{ident}(t) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-4\\beta t} + \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2(\\alpha+\\beta)t}$$\nThe expected proportion of observed differences, $p$, is $1 - P_{ident}(t)$:\n$$p_{K80}(t) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-4\\beta t} + \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2(\\alpha+\\beta)t}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}e^{-4\\beta t} - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2(\\alpha+\\beta)t}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$-4\\beta t = -4\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)t = -\\frac{t}{3}$$\n$$-2(\\alpha+\\beta)t = -2\\left(\\frac{10}{12} + \\frac{1}{12}\\right)t = -2\\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right)t = -\\frac{11t}{6}$$\nSo, the proportion of differences generated by the true process over a branch of length $t$ is:\n$$p_{K80}(t) = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}e^{-t/3} - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-11t/6}$$\n\nNext, we define the fitted model, JC$69$. This model is a special case of K$80$ where $\\alpha = \\beta$.

This indicates an underestimation.\n\nTo determine if this holds for all $t > 0$, we can use Jensen's inequality. The function $f(x)=e^{-xt}$ is convex in $x$. The JC$69$ model corresponds to the K$80$ model with $\\alpha=\\beta$. The rate scaling $\\alpha+2\\beta = 1$ would give $\\alpha=\\beta=1/3$. The corresponding rates in the exponential terms would be $4\\beta = 4/3$ and $2(\\alpha+\\beta) = 4/3$. The K$80$ model with $R=10$ has a mixture of rates. The higher frequency of transitions leads to more multiple substitutions being unobserved (\"hidden\"). For a given true number of substitutions $t$, the observed proportion of differences $p_{K80}(t)$ is smaller than what a JC$69$ process would have produced, $p_{JC69\\_process}(t)$. Since the distance function $d_{JC69}(p)$ is monotonically increasing with $p$, a smaller input $p$ yields a smaller output distance. Thus, $d_{JC69}(t) < t$ for all $t > 0$.\n\nFurthermore, to examine how the bias $B(t) = t - d_{JC69}(t)$ changes with $t$, we can analyze the derivative of $d_{JC69}(t)$. For all $t > 0$, the derivative of the estimated distance, $d'_{JC69}(t)$, is less than 1. The derivative of the bias is $B'(t) = 1 - d'_{JC69}(t)$. Since $d'_{JC69}(t) < 1$, we have $B'(t) > 0$. This proves that the bias (the amount of underestimation) is a strictly increasing function of the true branch length $t$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA.
