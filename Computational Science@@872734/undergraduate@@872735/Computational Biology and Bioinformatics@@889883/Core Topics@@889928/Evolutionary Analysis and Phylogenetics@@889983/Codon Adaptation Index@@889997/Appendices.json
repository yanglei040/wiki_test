In many bacteria, highly expressed genes exhibit biased usage of synonymous codons that match abundant transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) species. This observation motivates a quantitative measure of how well a gene’s codon composition matches that of a reference set of highly expressed genes. The codon adaptation index (CAI) is constructed from codon-specific relative adaptiveness values derived from the reference set, where each codon’s relative adaptiveness can be obtained, for example, by normalizing its Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) by the maximum RSCU among its synonymous codons.\n\nYou are given a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) coding sequence (reading frame $+1$) for a putative open reading frame beginning with a canonical start codon and ending with a stop codon (stop codon shown for completeness but not to be scored in CAI).

It is based on established principles of molecular genetics and bioinformatics, specifically the Central Dogma, the degeneracy of the genetic code, and the concept of codon usage bias. The provided data—a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequence and a set of codon-specific relative adaptiveness weights—are sufficient and consistent for the required calculations. The tasks are clearly defined and formalizable. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem consists of two tasks: first, to provide a formal definition of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), and second, to calculate its value for a given sequence.\n\nTask 1: Definition of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)\n\nThe theoretical foundation of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) lies in fundamental observations of molecular biology. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, known as synonymous codons. It has been empirically observed, particularly in rapidly dividing microorganisms, that synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency. This phenomenon is termed codon usage bias. The prevailing hypothesis, supported by substantial evidence, is that this bias is a result of natural selection acting to optimize translational efficiency and accuracy. Genes that must be expressed at very high levels, such as those for ribosomal proteins or glycolytic enzymes, show a strong bias towards using a specific subset of \"optimal\" codons. These optimal codons are recognized by the most abundant species of transfer RNA (tRNA) in the cell, thus facilitating rapid and efficient polypeptide elongation.\n\nBased on these principles, the CAI is a quantitative measure designed to assess the extent to which a gene utilizes these preferred codons. It predicts the level of expression of a gene under the assumption that translational selection is the dominant force shaping its codon usage pattern. A higher CAI value suggests that a gene is likely to be highly expressed.\n\nThe construction of the CAI proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  A reference set of highly expressed genes for a specific organism is defined. This set is presumed to represent the \"optimal\" codon usage for that organism.\n\n2.  From this reference set, the relative adaptiveness, $w_c$, of each codon, $c$, is calculated. For a given amino acid, the codon used most frequently in the reference set is assigned a relative adaptiveness of $1.0$. The relative adaptiveness of any other synonymous codon, $c_i$, for that same amino acid is the ratio of its frequency of use, $f_i$, to the frequency of the most-used codon, $f_{\\text{max}}$.\n    $$w_{c_i} = \\frac{f_i}{f_{\\text{max}}}$$\n    For amino acids encoded by only one codon (Methionine, encoded by `AUG`, and Tryptophan, encoded by `UGG`), there is no codon choice, and their relative adaptiveness is defined as $1.0$.\n\n3.  The CAI for a given gene of length $L$ codons (excluding the stop codon) is then calculated as the geometric mean of the relative adaptiveness values for each codon in its coding sequence. If $w_k$ is the relative adaptiveness of the $k$-th codon in the gene, the CAI is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\text{CAI} = \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{L} w_k \\right)^{\\frac{1}{L}} $$\n    This can also be expressed equivalently using logarithms, which is often more numerically stable:\n    $$ \\text{CAI} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=1}^{L} \\ln(w_k) \\right) $$\n\nThe use of a multiplicative aggregation (geometric mean) rather than an additive one (arithmetic mean) is a critical feature of the CAI. Protein synthesis is a sequential process where each codon is translated in order. The overall rate of synthesis can be limited by the slowest step, which corresponds to the translation of the codon with the lowest adaptiveness (i.e., the one recognized by the rarest tRNA). An arithmetic mean would obscure this \"bottleneck\" effect, as a few highly optimal codons could numerically compensate for one very poor codon. The geometric mean, however, is highly sensitive to low values. A single codon with a relative adaptiveness approaching zero will drive the entire CAI value towards zero, correctly reflecting the disproportionate negative impact of a single rate-limiting step on overall translational efficiency.\n\nTask 2: Calculation of the CAI\n\nThe provided mRNA sequence is $5'$-`AUG GCU GCU GAA GAA UUU UUC CGU CGC AGA UGG GCG AAG UAA`-$3'$. The problem requires the calculation to exclude the stop codon (`UAA`). The coding sequence to be scored therefore begins with the start codon `AUG` and ends with `AAG`. The total length of the sequence to be scored is $L = 13$ codons.\n\nThe sequence of codons and their corresponding relative adaptiveness weights, $w_k$, as provided are:\n1.  Codon 1: `AUG`, $w_1 = 1.00$\n2.  Codon 2: `GCU`, $w_2 = 0.35$\n3.  Codon 3: `GCU`, $w_3 = 0.35$\n4.  Codon 4: `GAA`, $w_4 = 0.65$\n5.  Codon 5: `GAA`, $w_5 = 0.65$\n6.  Codon 6: `UUU`, $w_6 = 0.55$\n7.  Codon 7: `UUC`, $w_7 = 1.00$\n8.  Codon 8: `CGU`, $w_8 = 0.40$\n9.  Codon 9: `CGC`, $w_9 = 0.95$\n10. Codon 10: `AGA`, $w_{10} = 0.85$\n11. Codon 11: `UGG`, $w_{11} = 1.00$\n12. Codon 12: `GCG`, $w_{12} = 0.80$\n13. Codon 13: `AAG`, $w_{13} = 1.00$\n\nThe CAI is the geometric mean of these $13$ weights:\n$$ \\text{CAI} = \\left( w_1 \\times w_2 \\times w_3 \\times \\dots \\times w_{13} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{13}} $$\nFirst, we compute the product of the weights:\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{13} w_k = (1.00) \\times (0.35) \\times (0.35) \\times (0.65) \\times (0.65) \\times (0.55) \\times (1.00) \\times (0.40) \\times (0.95) \\times (0.85) \\times (1.00) \\times (0.80) \\times (1.00) $$\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{13} w_k = (0.35)^2 \\times (0.65)^2 \\times 0.55 \\times 0.40 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.80 $$\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{13} w_k = (0.1225) \\times (0.4225) \\times (0.55) \\times (0.40) \\times (0.95) \\times (0.85) \\times (0.80) $$\n$$ \\prod_{k=1}^{13} w_k = 0.007355600375 $$\nNow, we take the $13$-th root of this product:\n$$ \\text{CAI} = (0.007355600375)^{\\frac{1}{13}} $$\n$$ \\text{CAI} \\approx 0.68532408 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{CAI} \\approx 0.6853 $$\nThis value, being between $0$ and $1$, represents a moderate level of codon adaptation for the given gene in the context of the specified organism's translational machinery.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6853}$$", "id": "2843211"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple calculation, this exercise challenges you to think algorithmically about gene optimization, a common task in synthetic biology.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a deterministic solution.\n\nFirst, we formalize the definitions provided. A gene is a sequence of $n$ codons, $(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n)$. For each codon $c$, which codes for an amino acid $a$, its relative adaptiveness weight $w(c)$ is defined as:\n$$ w(c) = \\frac{f(c)}{\\max\\{f(c') : c' \\in \\mathcal{S}(a)\\}} $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{S}(a)$ is the set of synonymous codons for amino acid $a$, and $f(c)$ is a reference frequency value. By this definition, for any amino acid, there exists at least one \"optimal\" codon $c_{\\text{opt}}$ for which $w(c_{\\text{opt}}) = 1$. For all other synonymous codons $c'$, $w(c') \\le 1$. For amino acids with a single codon (Methionine, Tryptophan), the weight is defined as $1$.\n\nThe Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of the gene is the geometric mean of these weights:\n$$ \\text{CAI} = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} w(c_i) \\right)^{1/n} $$\nFor numerical stability, it is preferable to compute this using logarithms:\n$$ \\ln(\\text{CAI}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(w(c_i)) \\implies \\text{CAI} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(w(c_i))\\right) $$\n\nOur objective is to find the maximum increase, $\\Delta\\text{CAI}_{\\max}$, resulting from changing exactly one codon $c_j$ at some position $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ to a synonymous codon $c_s \\in \\mathcal{S}(a_j)$, where $a_j$ is the amino acid coded by $c_j$.\n\nLet the initial index be $\\text{CAI}_{\\text{initial}}$. If we substitute codon $c_j$ with $c_s$, the new index, $\\text{CAI}_{\\text{new}}$, is given by:\n$$ \\text{CAI}_{\\text{new}} = \\left( w(c_1) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot w(c_{j-1}) \\cdot w(c_s) \\cdot w(c_{j+1}) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot w(c_n) \\right)^{1/n} $$\nWe can express this in terms of the initial CAI. The product of weights changes by a factor of $w(c_s)/w(c_j)$.\n$$ \\prod_{i=1, i \\ne j}^{n} w(c_i) \\cdot w(c_s) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} w(c_i)\\right) \\cdot \\frac{w(c_s)}{w(c_j)} $$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides gives:\n$$ \\text{CAI}_{\\text{new}} = \\left(\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} w(c_i)\\right) \\cdot \\frac{w(c_s)}{w(c_j)}\\right)^{1/n} = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} w(c_i)\\right)^{1/n} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{w(c_s)}{w(c_j)}\\right)^{1/n} = \\text{CAI}_{\\text{initial}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{w(c_s)}{w(c_j)}\\right)^{1/n} $$\nThe increase in CAI is $\\Delta\\text{CAI} = \\text{CAI}_{\\text{new}} - \\text{CAI}_{\\text{initial}} = \\text{CAI}_{\\text{initial}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{w(c_s)}{w(c_j)}\\right)^{1/n} - 1 \\right]$.\n\nTo maximize this increase, we must maximize the term $\\left(w(c_s)/w(c_j)\\right)^{1/n}$. Since $n$ is a positive constant for a given gene, this is equivalent to maximizing the ratio $w(c_s)/w(c_j)$. This must be done over all possible positions $j$ and all possible synonymous substitutions $c_s$ at that position.\n\nLet us analyze the maximization logic. For any given position $j$, the codon $c_j$ and its weight $w(c_j)$ are fixed. We want to choose a synonymous codon $c_s$ that maximizes $w(c_s)$. As established, the maximum possible value for any $w(c)$ is $1$, which is achieved by the optimal codon $c_{\\text{opt}}$ for that amino acid. Thus, for any position $j$, the best possible substitution is to replace $c_j$ with $c_{\\text{opt}}$, making the new weight $w(c_s) = 1$. The resulting ratio is $1/w(c_j)$.\n\nNow we must choose the position $j$ that gives the overall maximum increase. This means we must find the position $j$ that maximizes the ratio $1/w(c_j)$. This is equivalent to finding the position $j$ with the minimum weight $w(c_j)$.\n\nLet $w_{\\min} = \\min_{i=1, \\dots, n} \\{w(c_i)\\}$. This minimum weight corresponds to the codon that is least adapted in the sequence. By replacing this codon with its optimal synonymous counterpart (with weight $1$), we achieve the maximum possible CAI for a single substitution.\n\nThe algorithm is therefore as follows:\n1.  **Pre-computation**:\n    a. Construct a mapping from each of the $61$ sense codons to its corresponding amino acid based on the standard genetic code.\n    b. Using the provided table of $f(c)$ values, for each amino acid $a$, find the maximum frequency value, $\\max\\{f(c') : c' \\in \\mathcal{S}(a)\\}$.\n    c. Compute and store the relative adaptiveness weight $w(c)$ for every sense codon.\n\n2.  **Per-Gene Calculation**: For each input gene sequence:\n    a. Parse the gene into its sequence of $n$ codons $(c_1, \\dots, c_n)$.\n    b. Create a list of the corresponding weights $(w(c_1), \\dots, w(c_n))$ using the pre-computed table.\n    c. Find the minimum weight in this list, $w_{\\min}$.\n    d. If $w_{\\min} \\ge 1.0$, every codon is already optimal or belongs to a single-codon family. No synonymous substitution can increase the CAI. The result is $0.0$.\n    e. If $w_{\\min} < 1.0$, an increase is possible. First, calculate the initial CAI for the gene, $\\text{CAI}_{\\text{initial}}$.\n    f.

Because the outlier’s residual is strongly negative, the constant-variance assumption is violated and inference from the model is invalid.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- A simple linear regression model is specified as $y_i \\;=\\; \\beta_0 \\;+\\; \\beta_1 x_i \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_i$.\n- The index $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$, representing genes.\n- The response variable $y_i$ is the natural logarithm of protein abundance for gene $i$.\n- The predictor variable $x_i$ is the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) for gene $i$.\n- The error terms $\\varepsilon_i$ are independent with mean $0$ and constant variance.\n- The model is fitted using ordinary least squares.\n- A specific gene is identified with a studentized residual less than $-3$.\n- This gene is described as a “massive negative outlier.”\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is well-grounded in computational biology and statistics. The relationship between codon bias (measured by CAI) and protein expression is a standard subject of investigation. The use of simple linear regression and logarithmic transformation is common and appropriate methodology.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear scenario from data analysis and asks for the correct interpretation of a specific statistical result (a large negative studentized residual).\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated objectively, using precise statistical terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and unambiguous. We shall proceed to the derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n**Derivation of Principles**\n\nThe simple linear regression model is given by:\n$$y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i$$\nAfter fitting by ordinary least squares (OLS), we obtain estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, which define the fitted line:\n$$\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i$$\nThe residual for observation $i$ is the difference between the observed and fitted values:\n$$e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$$\nA negative residual ($e_i < 0$) means the observed value $y_i$ is below the regression line.\n\nThe studentized residual, $r_i$, standardizes the raw residual by dividing it by an estimate of its standard deviation. A studentized residual with a value less than $-3$ is a rare event under the standard model assumptions (normality of errors), signifying that the observation is an outlier in the vertical direction relative to the fitted line. Specifically, it means that the observed response $y_i$ is significantly lower than the value $\\hat{y}_i$ predicted by the model based on its predictor value $x_i$.\n\nBiologically, the model attempts to explain protein abundance ($y_i$) using translational efficiency as proxied by codon usage ($x_i$, the CAI). The general expectation is that $\\beta_1 > 0$, as genes with codons optimized for translation (high CAI) are expected to produce more protein. The error term $\\varepsilon_i$ accounts for all other sources of variation, including other biological regulatory mechanisms and measurement noise. A large residual indicates that these other sources are substantial for the gene in question.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The gene’s observed protein abundance is far lower than predicted by the fitted linear relationship with Codon Adaptation Index (CAI). Biologically, this could reflect post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation, such as translational repression or rapid protein degradation under the assayed condition.**\n\nA studentized residual less than $-3$ signifies a large negative raw residual, $e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\ll 0$. This directly implies that the observed value, $y_i$ (log protein abundance), is far lower than the predicted value, $\\hat{y}_i$. The statistical part of the statement is a correct definition of a negative outlier. The biological interpretation is also correct. The model accounts only for codon bias. If the prediction fails so dramatically, it points to other biological processes not included in the model that are strongly affecting the final protein abundance. These processes include regulation at the post-transcriptional level (e.g., mRNA degradation) and post-translational level (e.g., translational repression or enhanced protein degradation). This outlier is not a nuisance; it is a potential biological discovery.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The gene must have an unusually low Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) and therefore necessarily has high leverage; it should be dropped from the model solely for that reason.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple errors.\n$1$. An outlier is a point with a large residual, meaning it is far from the regression line in the $y$-direction. This says nothing about its position in the $x$-direction. The gene's CAI ($x_i$) could be low, average, or high. The statement that it \"must have an unusually low\" CAI is false.\n$2$. Leverage is determined by how far an observation's $x_i$ value is from the mean of the predictor variables, $\\bar{x}$. A point has high leverage if its $x_i$ is unusual. Since the first clause is false, the conclusion of high leverage is unfounded. A point can have a large residual at any level of leverage.\n$3$. The recommendation to drop a data point \"solely for that reason\" (i.e., for having high leverage) is poor statistical practice. High leverage points can be highly informative. Exclusion of data must be justified by substantive reasons (e.g., confirmed measurement error, belonging to a different population), not just statistical properties alone.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The presence of a massive negative outlier implies that the estimated slope $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is negative, meaning higher Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) predicts lower protein abundance.**\n\nThis is a fallacious conclusion. The estimated slope $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is determined by the overall trend of all $n$ data points. While a single influential outlier can pull the line towards it, it does not by itself determine the sign of the slope, especially in a large dataset typical of genomic studies. The established biological trend is for higher CAI to be associated with higher expression, so we expect $\\hat{\\beta}_1 > 0$. A single outlier is highly unlikely to reverse this overall trend. Its effect on the slope depends on its leverage (its $x_i$ value); a negative outlier with $x_i > \\bar{x}$ will pull the slope down, while one with $x_i < \\bar{x}$ will pull the slope up. It does not guarantee a negative slope.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The gene has a large negative residual relative to its predicted value, so it is prudent to evaluate its influence on the fit (for example, via a suitable influence measure) before deciding on exclusion; biologically, it may indicate regulation beyond codon bias.**\n\nThis statement describes the canonical and correct approach to dealing with outliers.\n$1$. Identification: The gene has a large negative residual (a studentized residual less than $-3$).\n$2$. Diagnosis: The appropriate next step is to assess the point's influence on the model parameters ($\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1$). Influence is a combination of leverage and residual size. Measures such as Cook's distance, DFFITS, and DFBETAS are designed for this purpose. A decision on exclusion is a serious step that should be informed by such influence diagnostics.\n$3$. Interpretation: As in option A, the statement correctly notes that the outlier is biologically interesting, potentially indicating that the gene is subject to regulatory mechanisms not captured by the simple model.\n\nThis represents sound statistical procedure and correct biological reasoning.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Because the outlier’s residual is strongly negative, the constant-variance assumption is violated and inference from the model is invalid.**\n\nThis is a misinterpretation of model assumptions. The constant variance (homoscedasticity) assumption posits that the variance of the error term $\\varepsilon_i$ is the same for all observations, i.e., $\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_i) = \\sigma^2$ for all $i$. A violation of this assumption would be a systematic pattern, such as the spread of residuals increasing with the fitted values. The existence of a *single* outlier does not, in itself, constitute evidence of such a systematic pattern. It is an isolated event. This single point could be the result of a non-normal (e.g., heavy-tailed) error distribution, or simply a true anomaly, without disproving that the variance is constant for the bulk of the data. To claim the entire assumption is violated based on one point is an overstatement and logically flawed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2429436"}]}
