The expression must be in terms of $D$, $w$, and $|\\Sigma|$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the criteria for validity.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes a simplified but standard probabilistic model for analyzing sequence alignment statistics. The BLAST algorithm and its seed-based heuristic are fundamental concepts in computational biology. The model of sequences as i.i.d. random variables is a common first-order approximation in this field. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a specific probability under a fully specified model. All necessary parameters ($D$, $w$, $|\\Sigma|$) are provided symbolically. The objective is unambiguous. The explicit instruction to assume independence of trials, while a simplification of the real-world scenario of overlapping substrings, removes ambiguity and makes the problem uniquely solvable. This assumption is a feature of the model to be analyzed, not a flaw in the problem's statement.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical language. It is free of subjective or opinion-based content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a self-contained, consistent, and well-posed question based on a standard simplified model in bioinformatics. Proceeding to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find the probability of observing at least one exact match of a fixed seed of length $w$ within a database sequence of length $D$.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the database contains at least one hit. It is computationally more straightforward to first calculate the probability of the complement event, $A^c$, which is the event that the database contains no hits. The desired probability is then given by the relation $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$.\n\nThe database sequence has length $D$. A contiguous substring of length $w$ can start at any position from $1$ to $D - w + 1$. We assume $D \\geq w$, otherwise no substring of length $w$ exists and the probability of a hit is trivially $0$. The total number of possible starting positions for a length-$w$ substring, which we will treat as trials, is $N = D - w + 1$.\n\nLet's first determine the probability of a hit in a single trial. A trial consists of comparing the fixed seed to a specific length-$w$ substring of the database. Let the seed be $s_1 s_2 \\dots s_w$ and a database substring be $d_1 d_2 \\dots d_w$. A hit occurs if $s_i = d_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, w\\}$.\n\nAccording to the model, each character $d_i$ in the database is drawn independently and uniformly from the alphabet $\\Sigma$ of size $|\\Sigma|$. The probability that a single character $d_i$ matches the corresponding character $s_i$ of the fixed seed is $\\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|}$.\n\nSince the characters within the database substring are drawn independently, the probability that all $w$ characters of the substring match the seed is the product of the individual character match probabilities. Let $p$ be the probability of a hit in a single trial.\n$$p = \\left(\\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|}\\right) \\times \\dots \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|}\\right) \\quad (w \\text{ times})$$\n$$p = \\left(\\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|}\\right)^{w} = \\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|^w}$$\n\nThe event $A^c$ is the event that there are no hits across all $N$ possible starting positions. The problem explicitly states that these $N$ trials are to be treated as independent. Let $E_i$ be the event of a hit at the $i$-th starting position. We are looking for $P(\\bigcap_{i=1}^{N} E_i^c)$.\nDue to the independence of trials:\n$$P(A^c) = P(\\text{no hit in trial } 1 \\text{ AND no hit in trial } 2 \\dots \\text{ AND no hit in trial } N)$$\n$$P(A^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(E_i^c)$$\n\nThe probability of not having a hit in any single trial is $P(E_i^c) = 1 - P(E_i) = 1 - p$.\n$$P(E_i^c) = 1 - \\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|^w}$$\nSince the probability model is identical for all starting positions, $P(E_i^c)$ is the same for all $i$. Therefore, the probability of no hits in any of the $N$ trials is:\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - p)^N = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|^w}\\right)^{N}$$\nSubstituting $N = D - w + 1$:\n$$P(A^c) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|^w}\\right)^{D-w+1}$$\n\nFinally, the probability of at least one hit, $P(A)$, is:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|^w}\\right)^{D-w+1}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the probability of the database containing at least one hit under the specified model and its simplifying assumption of independence. This expression is valid for $D \\ge w$. If $D < w$, then $D-w+1 \\le 0$, which implies $0$ trials. The probability of an event in $0$ trials is $0$. Our formula correctly gives $1 - (\\dots)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0$ for the case $D-w+1=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{|\\Sigma|^{w}}\\right)^{D-w+1}}$$", "id": "2434603"}, {"introduction": "BLAST's reliance on a seeding heuristic is the key to its remarkable speed, but this speed comes at a cost to sensitivity.

It is a well-formulated question about the behavior of a standard bioinformatics algorithm under erroneous but well-defined conditions. We shall proceed to a full analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is a fundamental type mismatch. The **blastp** program is designed to operate on protein sequences, which are strings over the amino acid alphabet $\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{aa}}$ of size $20$. All its core operations are predicated on the existence of a scoring matrix $S(a,b)$ defined for all pairs $(a,b) \\in \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{aa}} \\times \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{aa}}$, meaning a $20 \\times 20$ matrix. The user provides a nucleotide matrix, such as NUC.4.4, which is a $4 \\times 4$ matrix defined over the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{nt}}$. While some letters are shared between the typical representations of these alphabets (e.g., 'A' for Alanine and Adenine, 'C' for Cysteine and Cytosine, etc.), this is a superficial ambiguity. Fundamentally, the provided matrix is specified for only $4$ of the $20$ entities **blastp** expects to handle.\n\nA robust and correctly implemented scientific program must validate its inputs before initiating computation. Let us analyze the consequences of this mismatch for each stage of the BLAST algorithm, assuming the program did not halt at initialization.\n\n1.  **Initialization and Parameterization**: Before the search begins, BLAST must be configured. This includes loading the substitution matrix $S(a,b)$ and determining the statistical parameters $\\lambda$ and $K$.\n    -   **Matrix Loading**: The program expects a $20 \\times 20$ matrix. When it reads the user-provided file for NUC.4.4, it will find a $4 \\times 4$ matrix. This dimensionality mismatch is a critical failure condition. The matrix $S(a,b)$ is simply not defined for pairs like (Leucine, Proline) or any pair involving the $16$ amino acids not in the set $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$. The requirement that the software \"must be able to define $S(a,b)$ on $\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{aa}} \\times \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{aa}}$\" is impossible to satisfy with the given input.\n    -   **Statistical Parameters**: The calculation of $\\lambda$ and $K$ requires solving an equation involving the expected score $E = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{aa}}} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{aa}}} p_i p_j S(i,j)$, where $p_i$ is the background frequency of amino acid $i$. Since $S(i,j)$ is undefined for most pairs, this sum cannot be computed. The prerequisite of a negative expected score cannot be verified. Therefore, valid statistical parameters cannot be computed.\n\n2.  **Seed Stage**: This stage identifies short, high-scoring word pairs (seeds). To do this, for each $w$-letter word in the query, BLAST generates a \"neighborhood\" of words that score above a threshold $T$ when aligned with the query word. This scoring is performed using $S(a,b)$. If a query word contains any amino acid other than Alanine, Cysteine, Glycine, or Threonine (the amino acids sharing single-letter codes with nucleotides), its score against any other word cannot be computed. The seeding mechanism would be inoperable for the vast majority of a typical protein sequence.\n\n3.  **Extend Stage**: This stage extends seeds to generate HSPs. The score of the alignment is the sum of substitution scores from $S(a,b)$. If an alignment contains a pair of residues for which $S(a,b)$ is not defined, the extension cannot proceed.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Stage**: This stage is contingent on the successful generation of HSPs and the pre-computation of $\\lambda$ and $K$. As both of these preceding requirements fail, this stage is unreachable.\n\nThe only logical conclusion is that a properly designed program would detect this fundamental incompatibility at the very beginning—during the initialization and validation phase—and terminate with an error. It cannot proceed to any of the search stages.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. **blastp** completes normally by internally expanding the $4 \\times 4$ matrix to a $20 \\times 20$ matrix by assigning zero scores to all undefined amino acid pairs, which inflates the number of high-scoring segment pairs and yields deflated $E$-values.**\n\nThis proposal is illogical and contradicts the problem constraints. Assigning a score of $0$ is an arbitrary choice, not a \"neutral\" one. This action would constitute an \"undocumented automatic coercion,\" which the problem statement forbids us from assuming. Furthermore, a matrix populated heavily with zeros would likely violate the Karlin-Altschul condition of a negative expected score, invalidating any statistical evaluation. The claim of \"deflated E-values\" is unsubstantiated speculation. This option describes reckless program behavior, not a valid operational consequence. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. **blastp** runs, but the seed stage only admits words composed of residues in $\\{A,C,G,T\\}$, so sensitivity drops; nevertheless, extension and evaluation proceed, and some true homologs are still found.**\n\nThis describes a crippled execution that is inconsistent with the design of BLAST. The algorithm is designed to process entire sequences. It would not selectively ignore parts of the query and database it cannot score. Upon encountering the first pair of amino acids for which the score is undefined—which would happen almost immediately for any typical protein—the program would face a fatal execution error. The notion that extension and evaluation could \"proceed\" is false, as the necessary components (a complete scoring matrix and statistical parameters) are absent. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. **blastp** rejects the matrix at initialization because the substitution matrix alphabet and dimensionality ($4 \\times 4$ versus $20 \\times 20$) are incompatible with $\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{aa}}$; as a result, neighbor word generation, extension scoring, and Karlin–Altschul parameters cannot be defined, and the run terminates with an error and no alignments.**\n\nThis outcome is the only one consistent with sound software engineering principles and the theoretical requirements of the BLAST algorithm. A program must validate its inputs. The provided matrix is fundamentally incompatible with the requirements of **blastp**. This incompatibility of dimensionality and alphabet makes it impossible to define the scoring function for protein alignments, which in turn prevents the calculation of statistical parameters, the generation of seed neighborhoods, and the scoring of extensions. The only correct and safe action for the program is to report the error and terminate at initialization. **Correct**.\n\n**D. **blastp** silently falls back to the default protein matrix (for example, BLOSUM62) and proceeds, possibly issuing a warning, so results are essentially unchanged relative to a standard run.**\n\n\"Silently\" falling back to a default after the user has explicitly provided a custom input is dangerously poor design. It subverts the user's intent and can lead to profound misinterpretation of results. While a program might fall back *with a clear and prominent warning*, the most robust behavior for an invalid input of this nature is a hard failure. The option suggesting a \"silent\" fallback is particularly egregious and also constitutes a form of \"coercion.\" Therefore, this is not the expected behavior of a well-designed scientific tool. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2434631"}]}
