A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by determining the effect of the scaling transformation on each quantity in the requested four-tuple. The scaling constant is $c=2$.\n\nFirst, consider the new raw score, $S_{\\mathrm{new}}$. By definition, the raw score is the sum of substitution scores over the pairs of residues in a given alignment. For the same fixed alignment, the new raw score $S_{\\mathrm{new}}$ is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\sum_{\\text{aligned pairs}} s_{\\mathrm{new}}(a,b) = \\sum_{\\text{aligned pairs}} c \\cdot s(a,b) = c \\left( \\sum_{\\text{aligned pairs}} s(a,b) \\right) = cS\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the new raw score to the old raw score is:\n$$\n\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{new}}}{S} = c = 2\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the new scale parameter, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}}$. It is the unique positive solution to the equation:\n$$\n\\sum_{a,b} p_{a} q_{b} \\exp(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} s_{\\mathrm{new}}(a,b)) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting $s_{\\mathrm{new}}(a,b) = c \\cdot s(a,b)$ into this equation gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{a,b} p_{a} q_{b} \\exp(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} (c \\cdot s(a,b))) = \\sum_{a,b} p_{a} q_{b} \\exp((c\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}}) s(a,b)) = 1\n$$\nThe original parameter $\\lambda$ is defined as the unique positive solution to $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a} q_{b} \\exp(\\lambda s(a,b)) = 1$. By comparing the two equations and invoking the uniqueness of the solution, we can equate the coefficients of $s(a,b)$ in the exponent:\n$$\n\\lambda = c\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} \\implies \\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{c}\n$$\nThe ratio of the new $\\lambda$ parameter to the old one is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nNow we consider the bit scores, $S'$ and $S'_{\\mathrm{new}}$, and the statistical parameters, $K$ and $K_{\\mathrm{new}}$. The purpose of the bit score is to provide a normalized measure of an alignment's statistical significance that is independent of the arbitrary scale of the underlying scoring matrix. The significance of a given alignment is an intrinsic property and should not change simply because the scoring matrix has been multiplied by a constant factor. Thus, the bit score for a specific alignment must be invariant under this scaling transformation. This is a fundamental principle of the normalization scheme. We therefore must have:\n$$\nS'_{\\mathrm{new}} = S'\n$$\nFrom this, the second element of the tuple is immediately determined:\n$$\nS'_{\\mathrm{new}} - S' = 0\n$$\n\nFinally, we use the invariance of the bit score to determine the relationship between $K_{\\mathrm{new}}$ and $K$. The definitions of the bit scores are:\n$$\nS' = \\frac{\\lambda S - \\ln K}{\\ln 2}\n$$\n$$\nS'_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} S_{\\mathrm{new}} - \\ln K_{\\mathrm{new}}}{\\ln 2}\n$$\nSince $S'_{\\mathrm{new}} = S'$, we can equate the expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda S - \\ln K}{\\ln 2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} S_{\\mathrm{new}} - \\ln K_{\\mathrm{new}}}{\\ln 2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda S - \\ln K = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} S_{\\mathrm{new}} - \\ln K_{\\mathrm{new}}\n$$\nWe have already established that $S_{\\mathrm{new}} = cS$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\lambda/c$. Substituting these into the right side of the equation:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} S_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{c}\\right) (cS) = \\lambda S\n$$\nThe product $\\lambda S$ is itself invariant under the scaling. Substituting this back into the equality:\n$$\n\\lambda S - \\ln K = \\lambda S - \\ln K_{\\mathrm{new}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n-\\ln K = -\\ln K_{\\mathrm{new}} \\implies \\ln K = \\ln K_{\\mathrm{new}}\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\nK = K_{\\mathrm{new}}\n$$\nTherefore, the parameter $K$ is also invariant under this scaling. The ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{new}}}{K} = 1\n$$\n\nIn summary, the four requested quantities are:\n1.  $\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{new}}}{S} = 2$\n2.  $S'_{\\mathrm{new}} - S' = 0$\n3.  $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n4.  $\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{new}}}{K} = 1$\n\nAssembling these into the specified four-tuple gives the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2375719"}, {"introduction": "Is a higher raw score always better?
