It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of bioinformatics, specifically the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment, augmented with a standard banded constraint. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters: the two sequences $S$ and $T$, their lengths $m$ and $n$, a complete scoring scheme (match, mismatch, gap penalties), and a precise definition for the band half-width $w$ and initialization conditions. The objective is clear and formalizable. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe goal is to compute the optimal score for a banded global alignment of two DNA sequences, $S = \\texttt{GACT}$ (length $m=4$) and $T = \\texttt{GAT}$ (length $n=3$). The dynamic programming (DP) table, denoted by $D$, will have dimensions $(m+1) \\times (n+1)$, which is $5 \\times 4$. The indices $i$ range from $0$ to $4$ corresponding to prefixes of $S$, and $j$ ranges from $0$ to $3$ for prefixes of $T$.\n\nThe computation is restricted to a band defined by the constraint $|i - j| \\le w$, where the half-width $w=1$. Any cell $(i,j)$ not satisfying this condition is considered inaccessible, equivalent to having a score of $-\\infty$.\n\nThe scoring scheme is: match score $s_{match} = +2$, mismatch score $s_{mismatch} = -1$, and a linear gap penalty $g = -2$.\n\nThe recurrence relation for a cell $D(i,j)$ within the band is derived from the standard Needleman-Wunsch algorithm:\n$$\nD(i,j) = \\max\n\\begin{cases}\nD(i-1, j-1) + \\text{score}(S_i, T_j) & \\text{(from diagonal)} \\\\\nD(i-1, j) + g & \\text{(from up)} \\\\\nD(i, j-1) + g & \\text{(from left)}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $\\text{score}(S_i, T_j)$ is $s_{match}$ if $S_i = T_j$ and $s_{mismatch}$ otherwise. A predecessor cell outside the band provides a score of $-\\infty$ to this maximization, effectively disallowing transitions from it.\n\n**Step 1: Initialization**\nAccording to the problem, $D(0,0) = 0$. For the first row and column, we initialize cells that lie within the band:\n- For $i \\ge 1$, $D(i,0) = i \\times g$ if $|i-0| \\le w=1$. This holds only for $i=1$. Thus, $D(1,0) = 1 \\times (-2) = -2$. The cell $(2,0)$ is outside the band since $|2-0| > 1$.\n- For $j \\ge 1$, $D(0,j) = j \\times g$ if $|0-j| \\le w=1$. This holds only for $j=1$. Thus, $D(0,1) = 1 \\times (-2) = -2$.

From our calculation, this score is $4$.\n\nA traceback from $D(4,3)$ confirms this score. The value $D(4,3)=4$ was obtained from the diagonal predecessor $D(3,2)$, corresponding to aligning $S_4=\\text{'T'}$ with $T_3=\\text{'T'}$. The value $D(3,2)=2$ came from the 'up' predecessor $D(2,2)$, corresponding to aligning $S_3=\\text{'C'}$ with a gap. The value $D(2,2)=4$ came from the diagonal predecessor $D(1,1)$, aligning $S_2=\\text{'A'}$ with $T_2=\\text{'A'}$. Finally, $D(1,1)=2$ came from the diagonal predecessor $D(0,0)=0$, aligning $S_1=\\text{'G'}$ with $T_1=\\text{'G'}$. This yields the alignment:\nS: G A C T\nT: G A - T\nThe score is $(+2) + (+2) + (-2) + (+2) = 4$, which is consistent.\n\nThe final optimal banded global alignment score is $D(4,3)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2374044"}, {"introduction": "After mastering the mechanics, the next step is strategic application.

This $k_{\\min}$ must be sufficient to guarantee that the true optimal global alignment score is found for two specific DNA sequences, $S$ and $T$, under an affine gap penalty model.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the given information.\nThe sequences are:\n$S = \\texttt{AAAAAACCCCCCTTTTTTGGGGGG}$\n$T = \\texttt{AAAAAACCCCCCGGGGGG}$\nThe length of sequence $S$ is $n=24$. The length of sequence $T$ is $m=18$.\n\nThe scoring scheme is as follows:\n- Match score: $s_{\\text{match}} = +1$\n- Mismatch score: $s_{\\text{mismatch}} = -2$\n- Gap opening penalty: $g_{\\text{open}} = -2$\n- Gap extension penalty: $g_{\\text{extend}} = -1$\n\nA contiguous gap of length $\\ell$ incurs a total penalty of $G(\\ell) = g_{\\text{open}} + (\\ell-1)g_{\\text{extend}} = -2 - (\\ell-1)$.\n\nThe banded alignment algorithm restricts the dynamic programming computation to a band of cells $(i,j)$ in the DP matrix, where $i$ is the index for sequence $S$ (from $0$ to $n$) and $j$ is the index for sequence $T$ (from $0$ to $m$), such that the condition $|i-j| \\leq k$ is met. The algorithm is guaranteed to find the optimal alignment if and only if the entire path corresponding to the optimal alignment lies within this band. Therefore, the minimum required half-width $k_{\\min}$ is the maximum value of $|i-j|$ over all cells $(i,j)$ that constitute the optimal alignment path.\n\nOur task is thus to identify the optimal global alignment of $S$ and $T$ and then calculate the maximum value of $|i-j|$ along its corresponding path in the DP matrix.\n\nLet us analyze the structure of the sequences.\nSequence $S$ is composed of four blocks of six identical nucleotides:\n$S = S_1 S_2 S_3 S_4$, where $S_1=\\text{A}_6$, $S_2=\\text{C}_6$, $S_3=\\text{T}_6$, $S_4=\\text{G}_6$.\nSequence $T$ is composed of three blocks of six identical nucleotides:\n$T = T_1 T_2 T_3$, where $T_1=\\text{A}_6$, $T_2=\\text{C}_6$, $T_3=\\text{G}_6$.\n\nAn optimal alignment will maximize the total score by aligning identical blocks where possible. The blocks $S_1$ and $T_1$, $S_2$ and $T_2$, and $S_4$ and $T_3$ are identical. The block $S_3 = \\text{TTTTTT}$ in sequence $S$ has no homologous counterpart in sequence $T$.\n\nThe optimal alignment strategy is intuitively clear:\n1. Align $S_1S_2$ with $T_1T_2$. This is an alignment of $\\text{AAAAAACCCCCC}$ with $\\text{AAAAAACCCCCC}$, consisting of $12$ matches. The score for this part is $12 \\times s_{\\text{match}} = 12 \\times 1 = 12$.\n2. Address the block $S_3 = \\text{TTTTTT}$. It can either be aligned with a gap in $T$ or be mismatched against the next block in $T$, which is $T_3 = \\text{GGGGGG}$.\n   - Option A: Align $S_3$ with a gap of length $\\ell=6$ in sequence $T$. The score from this is the gap penalty $G(6) = -2 - (6-1) \\times 1 = -7$.\n   - Option B: Align $S_3$ with $T_3$. This would result in $6$ mismatches (`T` vs `G`). The score would be $6 \\times s_{\\text{mismatch}} = 6 \\times (-2) = -12$.\n   Since $-7 > -12$, aligning $S_3$ with a gap is the optimal choice for this segment.\n3. Align the remaining block $S_4 = \\text{GGGGGG}$ with $T_3 = \\text{GGGGGG}$. This alignment provides $6$ matches, with a score of $6 \\times s_{\\text{match}} = 6 \\times 1 = 6$.\n\nThe resulting optimal alignment is:\n$S$: AAAAAACCCCCCTTTTTTGGGGGG\n$T$: AAAAAACCCCC------GGGGGG\n\nThe total score for this alignment is $12 + (-7) + 6 = 11$. Any other alignment would introduce mismatches or suboptimal gaps, leading to a lower score. For example, breaking up the perfect match blocks would replace match scores ($+1$) with mismatch ($-2$) or gap ($-2$ for opening) scores, which is clearly suboptimal.\n\nNow we must trace the path of this optimal alignment in the DP matrix of size $(n+1) \\times (m+1) = 25 \\times 19$. The indices are $i \\in [0, 24]$ and $j \\in [0, 18]$. The path starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(24,18)$.\n\n1.  The alignment of the first $12$ characters ($\\text{AAAAAACCCCCC}$) is a perfect match. This corresponds to $12$ diagonal steps in the DP matrix. The path goes from $(0,0)$ to $(12,12)$. For any cell $(i,j)$ on this segment, we have $i=j$, so $|i-j|=0$.\n\n2.  The alignment of $\\text{TTTTTT}$ from $S$ with a gap in $T$ corresponds to $6$ vertical steps in the DP matrix (since we are consuming characters from $S$ but not from $T$). The path goes from $(12,12)$ to $(18,12)$. For any cell $(i,j)$ on this segment, $j=12$ while $i$ ranges from $13$ to $18$. The value of $|i-j|$ is $|i-12|$. This value increases from $|13-12|=1$ to a maximum of $|18-12|=6$ at the cell $(18,12)$.\n\n3.  The alignment of the final $6$ characters ($\\text{GGGGGG}$) is another perfect match. This corresponds to $6$ diagonal steps. The path goes from $(18,12)$ to $(24,18)$. For any cell $(i,j)$ on this segment, the relationship between the indices is $j = i-6$. This is because for each step $d \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$, the cell is $(18+d, 12+d)$. The difference is $(18+d)-(12+d)=6$. Thus, for this entire segment, $|i-j| = |6| = 6$.\n\nCombining these three segments, the value of $|i-j|$ along the path is first $0$, then it increases from $1$ to $6$, and finally remains constant at $6$. The maximum value of $|i-j|$ encountered along the entire optimal path is therefore $6$.\n\nTo guarantee that the banded alignment algorithm finds this optimal path, the band half-width $k$ must be at least this maximum value.\n$$k_{\\min} = \\max_{(i,j) \\in \\text{optimal path}} |i-j| = 6$$\nThus, the smallest non-negative integer band half-width is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2373995"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate justification for banded alignment lies in its computational savings.

The values $0 \\le w \\le n$ are consistent with the typical application domain of this algorithm. The secondary task of constructing an example is also valid; for any given alignment path, it is known to be possible to construct sequences and a scoring scheme that make this path optimal. The condition that the optimal path remains within the band is a prerequisite for the banded algorithm to find the true global optimum, and its inclusion does not constitute a flaw.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. We will proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of DP cells $(i,j)$ that are computed by the algorithm. According to the problem statement, these are precisely the cells that satisfy the conditions:\n1. $0 \\le i \\le n$\n2. $0 \\le j \\le n$\n3. $|i - j| \\le w$\n\nThis is a problem of counting integer points within a specified region of a two-dimensional grid. We can solve this by summing the number of contributing cells along each diagonal of the DP matrix that falls within the band.\n\nA diagonal is defined by a constant value of the difference $k = i - j$. The condition $|i - j| \\le w$ is equivalent to $|-k| \\le w$, or $|k| \\le w$. This means we must consider a total of $2w+1$ diagonals, for $k \\in \\{-w, -w+1, \\ldots, 0, \\ldots, w-1, w\\}$.\n\nFor each diagonal specified by $k$, we must count the number of cells $(i,j)$ that lie on it and also within the grid boundaries $0 \\le i \\le n$ and $0 \\le j \\le n$. Substituting $j = i - k$ into the boundary conditions for $j$, we get $0 \\le i-k \\le n$, which implies $k \\le i \\le n+k$. Combined with the condition $0 \\le i \\le n$, the valid range for the index $i$ is $\\max(0, k) \\le i \\le \\min(n, n+k)$.\nThe number of cells on the diagonal $k$, denoted $N_k$, is thus $\\min(n, n+k) - \\max(0, k) + 1$.\n\nWe analyze this for two cases based on the sign of $k$:\nCase 1: $k \\ge 0$. Since $w \\le n$, we have $k \\le n$. The range for $i$ becomes $k \\le i \\le n$. The number of cells is $N_k = n - k + 1$. This applies for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, w$.\nCase 2: $k < 0$. The range for $i$ becomes $0 \\le i \\le n+k$. The number of cells is $N_k = (n+k) - 0 + 1 = n+k+1$. This applies for $k = -1, -2, \\ldots, -w$.\n\nThe total number of computed cells, $N$, is the sum of $N_k$ over all valid $k$:\n$$N = \\sum_{k=-w}^{w} N_k = \\sum_{k=-w}^{-1} (n+k+1) + \\sum_{k=0}^{w} (n-k+1)$$\n\nLet us evaluate these two sums separately. The second sum is:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{w} (n-k+1) = (n+1)\\sum_{k=0}^{w} 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{w} k = (w+1)(n+1) - \\frac{w(w+1)}{2}$$\nThis counts the cells on the main diagonal and the $w$ diagonals above it.\n\nFor the first sum, let us change the index of summation. Let $m = -k$. As $k$ runs from $-w$ to $-1$, $m$ runs from $w$ to $1$:\n$$\\sum_{k=-w}^{-1} (n+k+1) = \\sum_{m=1}^{w} (n-m+1)$$\nThis sum counts the cells on the $w$ diagonals below the main diagonal. The expression is identical to the sum from $k=1$ to $w$ in the previous part.\n$$\\sum_{m=1}^{w} (n-m+1) = \\sum_{k=1}^{w} (n-k+1) = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{w} (n-k+1)\\right) - (n-0+1) = \\left((w+1)(n+1) - \\frac{w(w+1)}{2}\\right) - (n+1)$$\n\nCombining the sums:\n$$N = \\left( (w+1)(n+1) - \\frac{w(w+1)}{2} \\right) + \\left( (w+1)(n+1) - \\frac{w(w+1)}{2} - (n+1) \\right)$$\n$$N = 2(w+1)(n+1) - w(w+1) - (n+1)$$\n$$N = (2w+2-1)(n+1) - w(w+1)$$\n$$N = (2w+1)(n+1) - w(w+1)$$\n\nThis is the exact number of computed cells. This expression can be verified with boundary conditions.\n- For $w=0$, the band is the main diagonal. $N = (1)(n+1) - 0 = n+1$, which is correct.\n- For $w=n$, the band covers the entire matrix. $N = (2n+1)(n+1) - n(n+1) = (2n+1-n)(n+1) = (n+1)(n+1) = (n+1)^2$, which is also correct.\n\nThe construction of sequences that force the alignment path to the band edges $|i-j|=w$ is possible by creating sequences with alternating blocks that do not match, forcing gapped alignments, and choosing a scoring scheme where mismatches are heavily penalized relative to gaps (e.g., $b \\gg g$). For example, let $S = (\\texttt{A}^w \\texttt{C}^w)^k \\texttt{A}^{n \\pmod{2w}}$ and $T = (\\texttt{C}^w \\texttt{A}^w)^k \\texttt{C}^{n \\pmod{2w}}$ for $n=2wk+ (n \\pmod{2w})$. With a scoring scheme where the mismatch penalty $-b$ is much larger in magnitude than the gap penalty $-g$, the optimal path will prefer to introduce blocks of $w$ gaps to align matching blocks (e.g., $\\texttt{C}^w$ with $\\texttt{C}^w$), forcing the path to coordinates $(i,j)$ where $|i-j|=w$. This demonstrates feasibility for the second part of the problem.
