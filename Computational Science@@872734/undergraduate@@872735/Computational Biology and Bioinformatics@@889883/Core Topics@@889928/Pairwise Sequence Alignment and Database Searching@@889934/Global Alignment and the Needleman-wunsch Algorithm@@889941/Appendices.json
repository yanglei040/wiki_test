It requires the computation of the optimal global alignment score for given pairs of sequences using specified scoring parameters. The core of the task is to compute this score via two distinct algorithmic approaches: one that uses memory quadratic in the lengths of the sequences, and another that uses memory linear in their lengths. Finally, it requires a verification that the scores produced by both methods are identical.\n\nThe problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and computationally feasible. All necessary data and parameters are provided. It does not violate any principles of mathematics or computer science. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying the calculation of the optimal alignment score is dynamic programming. Let the two sequences be $X = x_1 x_2 \\dots x_n$ of length $n$ and $Y = y_1 y_2 \\dots y_m$ of length $m$. Let the scoring parameters be $a$ for a match, $b$ for a mismatch, and $g$ for a gap. We define $F(i, j)$ as the optimal score for the global alignment of the prefixes $X[1 \\dots i]$ and $Y[1 \\dots j]$.\n\nThe score $F(i,j)$ can be computed by considering the three possible ways the alignment of these prefixes can end:\n$1$. $x_i$ is aligned with $y_j$. The score is $F(i-1, j-1) + s(x_i, y_j)$, where $s(x_i, y_j) = a$ if $x_i = y_j$ and $s(x_i, y_j) = b$ if $x_i \\neq y_j$.\n$2$. $x_i$ is aligned with a gap. The score is $F(i-1, j) + g$.\n$3$. $y_j$ is aligned with a gap. The score is $F(i, j-1) + g$.\n\nThe optimal score $F(i,j)$ is the maximum of these three possibilities. This gives the following recurrence relation:\n$$\nF(i, j) = \\max \\begin{cases} F(i-1, j-1) + s(x_i, y_j) \\\\ F(i, j-1) + g \\\\ F(i-1, j) + g \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe base cases for the recurrence are derived from aligning a prefix with an empty sequence, which consists entirely of gaps:\n$$\nF(i, 0) = i \\cdot g \\quad \\text{for } i \\in [0, n]\n$$\n$$\nF(0, j) = j \\cdot g \\quad \\text{for } j \\in [0, m]\n$$\nNote that $F(0,0) = 0$.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities, $S_{\\text{quad}}$ and $S_{\\text{lin}}$, which we will now address.\n\n**1. The Quadratic-Space Score, $S_{\\text{quad}}$**\n\nThis score is computed using the standard Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which directly implements the dynamic programming recurrence described above. It requires the construction of a two-dimensional matrix, or table, of size $(n+1) \\times (m+1)$ to store all subproblem solutions $F(i, j)$ for $i \\in [0, n]$ and $j \\in [0, m]$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by filling this table, typically row by row or column by column, starting from the base cases at $F(0,0)$. The final optimal score for the alignment of the complete sequences $X$ and $Y$ is found in the last cell of the table, $F(n,m)$.\n$$\nS_{\\text{quad}} = F(n,m)\n$$\nThe space complexity of this method is determined by the size of the storage matrix, which is $O(nm)$. This is quadratic in the lengths of the sequences.\n\n**2. The Linear-Space Score, $S_{\\text{lin}}$**\n\nThe problem asks for $S_{\\text{lin}}$, the score of an optimal alignment constructed using memory proportional to $n+m$. This refers to space-efficient variants of the dynamic programming algorithm. Inspection of the recurrence relation reveals that the computation of any cell $F(i, j)$ only depends on values in the same row, $F(i, j-1)$, and the preceding row, $F(i-1, \\cdot)$. Specifically, it depends on $F(i-1, j)$ and $F(i-1, j-1)$.\n\nThis dependency structure means that to compute row $i$ of the dynamic programming table, one only needs to have access to row $i-1$. It is not necessary to store all $O(nm)$ subproblem solutions simultaneously. We can maintain two arrays of size $O(m)$ (or $O(\\min(n,m))$ if we orient the computation along the shorter sequence length): one for the previous row's scores and one for the current row's scores being computed.\n\nLet `prev_row` store the scores $F(i-1, j)$ for $j \\in [0, m]$ and `curr_row` store the scores $F(i, j)$ for $j \\in [0, m]$. The computation for `curr_row[j]` uses `prev_row[j-1]`, `prev_row[j]`, and `curr_row[j-1]`. After `curr_row` is fully computed for a given $i$, it becomes the `prev_row` for the next iteration, $i+1$.\n\nThis procedure computes exactly the same values for the final row of the table as the quadratic-space method, but the memory requirement is reduced to $O(m) + O(m)$, which is $O(m)$. Since the input sequences of length $n$ and $m$ must also be stored, the total memory is proportional to $n+m$. The final score, $S_{\\text{lin}}$, is the last value computed for the last row, which corresponds to $F(n,m)$.\n\n**3. Equivalence**\n\nThe linear-space algorithm for finding the score is a direct optimization of the quadratic-space algorithm. It solves the identical recurrence relation and arrives at the same numerical result for $F(n,m)$. It merely discards intermediate values that are no longer needed, to save space. Full alignment reconstruction in linear space is more complex (requiring a divide-and-conquer approach, as in Hirschberg's algorithm), but the optimal *score* is the same. Therefore, it is a mathematical necessity that $S_{\\text{quad}} = S_{\\text{lin}}$. The programmatic task is to implement both methods correctly and verify this identity for the given test cases. Any result of `False` would indicate a flawed implementation, not a theoretical difference.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the global alignment problem for a suite of test cases.\n    For each case, it computes the optimal score using both a quadratic-space\n    and a linear-space dynamic programming algorithm, then verifies that\n    the scores are identical.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    test_cases = [\n        # Instance 1\n        {\"X\": \"GATTACA\", \"Y\": \"GCATGCU\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -2},\n        # Instance 2\n        {\"X\": \"\", \"Y\": \"ACGT\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -2},\n        # Instance 3\n        {\"X\": \"\", \"Y\": \"\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -2},\n        # Instance 4\n        {\"X\": \"AAAA\", \"Y\": \"TTTT\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -2},\n        # Instance 5\n        {\"X\": \"AGT\", \"Y\": \"GTT\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -2},\n        # Instance 6\n        {\"X\": \"AGCT\", \"Y\": \"AGTT\", \"a\": 3, \"b\": -2, \"g\": -4},\n        # Instance 7\n        {\"X\": \"AAAAAA\", \"Y\": \"AAA\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -2},\n        # Instance 8\n        {\"X\": \"C\", \"Y\": \"C\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -2},\n        # Instance 9\n        {\"X\": \"C\", \"Y\": \"A\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -2},\n        # Instance 10\n        {\"X\": \"ACGT\", \"Y\": \"ACGT\", \"a\": 1, \"b\": -1, \"g\": -1}\n    ]\n\n    def get_s_quad(X, Y, a, b, g):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the optimal global alignment score using O(nm) space.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = len(X)\n        m = len(Y)\n        \n        # F is the dynamic programming table\n        F = np.zeros((n + 1, m + 1), dtype=int)\n        \n        # Initialize base cases\n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            F[i, 0] = i * g\n        for j in range(m + 1):\n            F[0, j] = j * g\n            \n        # Fill the table using the recurrence relation\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            for j in range(1, m + 1):\n                match_mismatch_score = a if X[i-1] == Y[j-1] else b\n                \n                score_diag = F[i-1, j-1] + match_mismatch_score\n                score_up = F[i-1, j] + g\n                score_left = F[i, j-1] + g\n                \n                F[i, j] = max(score_diag, score_up, score_left)\n                \n        return F[n, m]\n\n    def get_s_lin(X, Y, a, b, g):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the optimal global alignment score using O(min(n, m)) space.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Ensure Y is the shorter sequence to optimize space\n        if len(X) < len(Y):\n            X, Y = Y, X\n            \n        n = len(X)\n        m = len(Y)\n        \n        if m == 0:\n            return n * g\n        \n        # prev_row stores scores from row i-1, curr_row stores scores for row i\n        prev_row = np.zeros(m + 1, dtype=int)\n        curr_row = np.zeros(m + 1, dtype=int)\n        \n        # Initialize first row (corresponds to i=0)\n        for j in range(m + 1):\n            prev_row[j] = j * g\n            \n        # Iterate through rows of the conceptual DP table\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            # Base case for the current row (j=0)\n            curr_row[0] = i * g\n            \n            # Fill the rest of the current row\n            for j in range(1, m + 1):\n                match_mismatch_score = a if X[i-1] == Y[j-1] else b\n                \n                score_diag = prev_row[j-1] + match_mismatch_score\n                score_up = prev_row[j] + g\n                score_left = curr_row[j-1] + g\n                \n                curr_row[j] = max(score_diag, score_up, score_left)\n            \n            # Current row becomes previous row for the next iteration\n            prev_row[:] = curr_row\n            \n        return curr_row[m]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        s_quad = get_s_quad(case[\"X\"], case[\"Y\"], case[\"a\"], case[\"b\"], case[\"g\"])\n        s_lin = get_s_lin(case[\"X\"], case[\"Y\"], case[\"a\"], case[\"b\"], case[\"g\"])\n        \n        # Verification: both methods must yield the same optimal score.\n        results.append(s_quad == s_lin)\n        \n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2395082"}, {"introduction": "While a linear gap penalty is simple, biological insertion and deletion events are often better modeled by an affine gap penalty, which distinguishes between the cost of opening a gap and extending it.

Let $s_i$ be the $i$-th character of $s$ and $t_j$ be the $j$-th character of $t$.\n\nThe matrices are defined as follows for $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,|s|\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,|t|\\}$:\n- $M(i,j)$: The score of the best alignment of the prefixes $s[1..i]$ and $t[1..j]$ where $s_i$ is aligned with $t_j$.\n- $I_x(i,j)$: The score of the best alignment of $s[1..i]$ and $t[1..j]$ where $s_i$ is aligned with a gap.\n- $I_y(i,j)$: The score of the best alignment of $s[1..i]$ and $t[1..j]$ where $t_j$ is aligned with a gap.\n\nThese matrices are populated using the following recurrence relations:\n\n$$\nM(i,j) = \\sigma(s_i, t_j) + \\max \\begin{cases} M(i-1, j-1) \\\\ I_x(i-1, j-1) \\\\ I_y(i-1, j-1) \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis recurrence states that aligning characters $s_i$ and $t_j$ (with score $\\sigma(s_i, t_j)$) can follow an alignment ending in a match/mismatch ($M$), a gap in $t$ ($I_x$), or a gap in $s$ ($I_y$).\n\n$$\nI_x(i,j) = \\max \\begin{cases} M(i-1, j) + g_{\\text{open}} + g_{\\text{extend}} & \\text{(open gap in } t \\text{)} \\\\ I_x(i-1, j) + g_{\\text{extend}} & \\text{(extend gap in } t \\text{)} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis captures the score of aligning $s_i$ with a gap. This state can be reached either by opening a new gap in $t$ (from an alignment ending in a match/mismatch) or by extending an existing gap in $t$.\n\n$$\nI_y(i,j) = \\max \\begin{cases} M(i, j-1) + g_{\\text{open}} + g_{\\text{extend}} & \\text{(open gap in } s \\text{)} \\\\ I_y(i, j-1) + g_{\\text{extend}} & \\text{(extend gap in } s \\text{)} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is symmetric to $I_x(i,j)$ and represents the score of aligning $t_j$ with a gap.\n\nThe initialization conditions for the matrices are crucial:\n- Base case: $M(0,0)=0$. All other entries in the $0$-th row and $0$-th column of $M$ are set to $-\\infty$ to forbid alignments starting with a match/mismatch.\n- Initial gaps: Aligning a prefix of a string with an empty string.\n  - $I_x(i,0) = g_{\\text{open}} + i \\cdot g_{\\text{extend}}$ for $i > 0$. Other $I_x(i,j)$ for $i=0$ or $j=0$ are $-\\infty$.\n  - $I_y(0,j) = g_{\\text{open}} + j \\cdot g_{\\text{extend}}$ for $j > 0$. Other $I_y(i,j)$ for $i=0$ or $j=0$ are $-\\infty$.\n\nAfter filling the matrices, the optimal global alignment score for strings $s$ and $t$ of lengths $n = |s|$ and $m = |t|$ is the maximum of the three possible final states:\n\n$$\nS^\\star(s,t) = \\max \\{ M(n,m), I_x(n,m), I_y(n,m) \\}\n$$\n\nThe provided parameters are $m=2$, $u=-1$, $g_{\\text{open}}=-2$, and $g_{\\text{extend}}=-1$.\n\n**2. Statistical Significance Analysis**\n\nTo assess if the score $S^\\star(s,t)$ is significantly high, it is compared against a background distribution of scores from alignments of $s$ with random sequences. The random sequences, $t^{(k)}$ for $k=1,\\dots,K$, are generated by randomly permuting the characters of the original string $t$. This preserves the length and character composition of $t$, which are important determinants of alignment scores. Using a fixed seed $z$ for the pseudorandom number generator ensures that this process is deterministic and reproducible.\n\nFor each of the $K$ shuffled strings $t^{(k)}$, we compute the optimal alignment score $S^\\star(s,t^{(k)})$ using the same algorithm described above. From this collection of $K$ scores, we calculate two statistics:\n\n- The arithmetic mean: $\\mu = \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=1}^{K} S^\\star(s,t^{(k)})$.\n- The population standard deviation: $\\sigma_{\\text{pop}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=1}^{K}(S^\\star(s,t^{(k)}) - \\mu)^2}$.\n\nFinally, the z-score $Z$ is computed. It measures how many standard deviations the original score $S^\\star(s,t)$ is from the mean of the scores of the shuffled sequences.\n\n$$\nZ=\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{S^\\star(s,t)-\\mu}{\\sigma_{\\text{pop}}}, & \\text{if }\\sigma_{\\text{pop}}>0, \\\\\n0, & \\text{if }\\sigma_{\\text{pop}}=0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe case $\\sigma_{\\text{pop}}=0$ occurs when all shuffled sequences produce the exact same alignment score, making a standard deviation-based comparison trivial.\n\nThe program will implement the dynamic programming algorithm in a function. This function will be called once for the original pair $(s,t)$ and then $K$ times for the pairs $(s, t^{(k)})$. The results will be collected to compute the final quadruple $[[S^\\star(s,t), \\mu, \\sigma_{\\text{pop}}, Z]]$, with each element rounded to $6$ decimal places.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_optimal_score(s: str, t: str, match: float, mismatch: float, gap_open: float, gap_extend: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the optimal global alignment score with affine gap penalties.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(s)\n    m = len(t)\n    \n    if n == 0 and m == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    if n == 0:\n        return gap_open + m * gap_extend\n    if m == 0:\n        return gap_open + n * gap_extend\n\n    neg_inf = -np.inf\n\n    # Initialization of DP matrices\n    M = np.full((n + 1, m + 1), neg_inf, dtype=float)\n    Ix = np.full((n + 1, m + 1), neg_inf, dtype=float)\n    Iy = np.full((n + 1, m + 1), neg_inf, dtype=float)\n\n    M[0, 0] = 0.0\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        Ix[i, 0] = gap_open + i * gap_extend\n    for j in range(1, m + 1):\n        Iy[0, j] = gap_open + j * gap_extend\n\n    # Fill DP matrices\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, m + 1):\n            # Substitution score\n            sub_score = match if s[i-1] == t[j-1] else mismatch\n            \n            # M(i,j) - alignment ends with s[i-1] vs t[j-1]\n            prev_m = M[i-1, j-1]\n            prev_ix = Ix[i-1, j-1]\n            prev_iy = Iy[i-1, j-1]\n            M[i, j] = sub_score + max(prev_m, prev_ix, prev_iy)\n\n            # Ix(i,j) - alignment ends with s[i-1] vs gap\n            open_gap_x = M[i-1, j] + gap_open + gap_extend\n            extend_gap_x = Ix[i-1, j] + gap_extend\n            Ix[i, j] = max(open_gap_x, extend_gap_x)\n            \n            # Iy(i,j) - alignment ends with gap vs t[j-1]\n            open_gap_y = M[i, j-1] + gap_open + gap_extend\n            extend_gap_y = Iy[i, j-1] + gap_extend\n            Iy[i, j] = max(open_gap_y, extend_gap_y)\n\n    # Final score is the max of the three states at the bottom-right corner\n    final_score = max(M[n, m], Ix[n, m], Iy[n, m])\n    return final_score\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run all test cases and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        {\"s\": \"ACGTCG\", \"t\": \"ACTCG\", \"K\": 200, \"z\": 314159},\n        {\"s\": \"AAAAAA\", \"t\": \"AAA\", \"K\": 200, \"z\": 271828},\n        {\"s\": \"GATTACA\", \"t\": \"GATTACA\", \"K\": 200, \"z\": 161803},\n        {\"s\": \"\", \"t\": \"ACGT\", \"K\": 200, \"z\": 42},\n    ]\n\n    # Scoring parameters\n    m_score = 2.0\n    u_score = -1.0\n    g_open = -2.0\n    g_extend = -1.0\n    \n    all_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        s, t, K, z = case[\"s\"], case[\"t\"], case[\"K\"], case[\"z\"]\n\n        # 1.

This exercise presents a hypothetical but illustrative scenario where a simple identity matrix outperforms a complex substitution matrix in identifying a functionally critical motif. By reasoning through the alignment preferences of different scoring systems [@problem_id:2395031], you will develop the crucial skill of critically evaluating how scoring parameters shape alignment outcomes and connect them to underlying biological constraints.", "problem": "A central principle in sequence analysis is that the biological relevance of a global alignment depends on what is under selection: some features are conserved only if the exact residues align, while other regions may tolerate conservative substitutions. Consider two peptide sequences $X$ and $Y$ that both contain the integrin-binding tripeptide motif RGD, which is often under strong functional constraint to be exactly conserved. The sequences are:\n\n- $X$: I L V I L V R G D I L\n- $Y$: I I L V I L V A R G D\n\nAssume we will compute a global alignment using the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm with a linear gap model. Two alternative scoring systems are given:\n\n- Identity scoring: $s(a,b)=+1$ if $a=b$, $s(a,b)=-1$ if $a\\neq b$, with a linear gap penalty $g=-1$ per gap symbol.\n- A BLOSUM-like complex substitution scheme $s'(a,b)$ with a linear gap penalty $g'=-6$, defined on the subset of residues that appear here as follows:\n  - $s'(a,a)=+4$ (exact matches).\n  - Conservative hydrophobic substitutions among $\\{\\mathrm{I},\\mathrm{L},\\mathrm{V}\\}$ score $+3$: $s'(\\mathrm{I},\\mathrm{L})=s'(\\mathrm{L},\\mathrm{I})=s'(\\mathrm{I},\\mathrm{V})=s'(\\mathrm{V},\\mathrm{I})=s'(\\mathrm{L},\\mathrm{V})=s'(\\mathrm{V},\\mathrm{L})=+3$.\n  - Specific nonconservative pairs: $s'(\\mathrm{R},\\mathrm{V})=s'(\\mathrm{V},\\mathrm{R})=-3$, $s'(\\mathrm{D},\\mathrm{R})=s'(\\mathrm{R},\\mathrm{D})=-2$, $s'(\\mathrm{L},\\mathrm{D})=s'(\\mathrm{D},\\mathrm{L})=-3$.\n  - Neutral pairs: $s'(\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{A})=s'(\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{G})=0$, $s'(\\mathrm{I},\\mathrm{G})=s'(\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{I})=0$.\n  - Any other unspecified mismatch scores $-1$.\n\nBiological context. For these two proteins it is known that the RGD motif must be aligned exactly (R on R, G on G, D on D) to preserve integrin binding; conservative substitutions in the hydrophobic background are frequently tolerated but not functionally decisive. A biologically relevant global alignment, therefore, is one that aligns the RGD tripeptide exactly, even if it must introduce gaps in a nearby low-complexity hydrophobic region.\n\nFundamental base. The global alignment score for an alignment of prefixes $X[1..i]$ and $Y[1..j]$ under a linear gap model obeys the Needleman–Wunsch dynamic programming recurrence\n$$\nF(i,j) \\;=\\; \\max\\big\\{\\, F(i-1,j-1) + s(x_i,y_j),\\;\\; F(i-1,j)+g,\\;\\; F(i,j-1)+g \\,\\big\\}\n$$\nwith appropriate initialization, where $s$ is the substitution score and $g$ the gap penalty (and analogously with $s'$ and $g'$ for the BLOSUM-like scheme). An optimal global alignment corresponds to an optimal path in this dynamic program.\n\nTask. Without constructing the full dynamic programming tables, reason from the recurrence and the scoring definitions to identify which alignment structure each scoring scheme will prefer between these two natural competitors:\n- A “no-gap” alignment that keeps the long hydrophobic block aligned on the diagonal and does not realign the RGD motif (it becomes offset and largely mismatched).\n- A “motif-aligned” alignment that introduces gaps inside the hydrophobic block to slide the sequences so that RGD aligns exactly.\n\nWhich statement is correct?\n\nA. Under the identity scoring, the optimal alignment introduces $2$ gaps to align RGD exactly and achieves a higher score than the best no-gap alignment; under the BLOSUM-like scheme with $g'=-6$, the optimal alignment avoids gaps, keeps the hydrophobic block aligned, and leaves RGD misaligned because this yields a higher score. Thus, the identity-scored alignment is more biologically relevant.\n\nB. Both scoring schemes choose the same optimal alignment that aligns RGD exactly; neither scheme offers an advantage.\n\nC. Under the identity scoring, the optimal alignment avoids gaps and misaligns RGD; under the BLOSUM-like scheme, the optimal alignment aligns RGD exactly even if it must introduce gaps. Thus, the BLOSUM-like scheme is more biologically relevant.\n\nD.

The scoring schemes, including a simplified identity matrix and a BLOSUM-like matrix, are standard tools. The $\\text{RGD}$ motif is a classic, well-documented example of a functionally constrained short linear motif. The problem is firmly based in established computational biology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides two specific sequences, two distinct and fully defined scoring systems, and two clearly described competing alignment structures. The task is to calculate and compare the scores for these alignments, which is a deterministic and well-defined mathematical procedure. A unique, meaningful answer can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective language and quantitative data (sequences, scores). It does not contain subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The sequences have the same length ($11$), which simplifies the \"no-gap\" case but requires careful construction of the \"motif-aligned\" case, as a shift must be accomplished by an equal number of insertions and deletions. This is a standard feature of global alignment problems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will now proceed by calculating and comparing the scores of the two specified alignment structures under both scoring systems.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to determine which of two alignment structures is preferred by each of the two scoring systems. We must first explicitly construct these two alignments.\n\n**Alignment 1: The \"No-gap\" Alignment**\nSince both sequences $X$ and $Y$ have length $11$, the no-gap global alignment is a direct, column-wise pairing of residues:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lllllllllll}\nX: & \\text{I} & \\text{L} & \\text{V} & \\text{I} & \\text{L} & \\text{V} & \\text{R} & \\text{G} & \\text{D} & \\text{I} & \\text{L} \\\\\nY: & \\text{I} & \\text{I} & \\text{L} & \\text{V} & \\text{I} & \\text{L} & \\text{V} & \\text{A} & \\text{R} & \\text{G} & \\text{D}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Alignment 2: The \"Motif-aligned\" Alignment**\nThe motif $\\text{RGD}$ appears at indices $7-9$ in $X$ and $9-11$ in $Y$. To align them, a shift of $2$ positions is required. For a global alignment of two sequences of equal length, any insertions in one sequence must be balanced by insertions in the other. To align $X[7..9]$ with $Y[9..11]$, the prefix $X[1..6]$ (length $6$) must be aligned with the prefix $Y[1..8]$ (length $8$), requiring $2$ gaps in $X$. The suffix $X[10..11]$ (length $2$) must be aligned with an empty suffix from $Y$, requiring $2$ gaps in $Y$.

Score(Motif-aligned) = $-5$.\n  Since $-5 > -9$, the identity scoring scheme prefers the motif-aligned structure.\n\n**Analysis with BLOSUM-like Scoring ($s'(a,b)$, $g'=-6$)**\n\n- **Score for Alignment 1 (No-gap)**:\n  `I/I`: $s'(\\text{I},\\text{I})=+4$.\n  `L/I`: $s'(\\text{L},\\text{I})=+3$.\n  `V/L`: $s'(\\text{V},\\text{L})=+3$.\n  `I/V`: $s'(\\text{I},\\text{V})=+3$.\n  `L/I`: $s'(\\text{L},\\text{I})=+3$.\n  `V/L`: $s'(\\text{V},\\text{L})=+3$.\n  `R/V`: $s'(\\text{R},\\text{V})=-3$.\n  `G/A`: $s'(\\text{G},\\text{A})=0$.\n  `D/R`: $s'(\\text{D},\\text{R})=-2$.\n  `I/G`: $s'(\\text{I},\\text{G})=0$.\n  `L/D`: $s'(\\text{L},\\text{D})=-3$.\n  Total Score $= (4+3+3+3+3+3) - 3 + 0 - 2 + 0 - 3 = 19 - 8 = +11$.\n\n- **Score for Alignment 2 (Motif-aligned)**:\n  This alignment contains substitution pairs and $4$ gaps. The gap penalty is severe: $g'=-6$.\n  - Substitution scores for prefix `ILVILV` vs `IILVIL`: $s'(\\text{I},\\text{I}) + s'(\\text{L},\\text{I}) + s'(\\text{V},\\text{L}) + s'(\\text{I},\\text{V}) + s'(\\text{L},\\text{I}) + s'(\\text{V},\\text{L}) = 4+3+3+3+3+3 = +19$.\n  - Substitution scores for motif `RGD` vs `RGD`: $s'(\\text{R},\\text{R}) + s'(\\text{G},\\text{G}) + s'(\\text{D},\\text{D}) = 4+4+4 = +12$.\n  - Total penalty for $4$ gaps: $4 \\times g' = 4 \\times (-6) = -24$.\n  Total Score = (Score of prefix pairs) + (Score of motif pairs) + (Penalty for gaps).\n  Total Score $= +19 + 12 - 24 = +7$.\n\n- **Comparison**: Score(No-gap) $=+11$. Score(Motif-aligned) $=+7$.\n  Since $+11 > +7$, the BLOSUM-like scheme prefers the no-gap alignment. The high penalty for gaps ($g'=-6$) makes it prohibitively expensive to introduce them, even to align the high-scoring RGD matches.\n\n### Conclusions and Option Evaluation\n\n- **Identity Scoring**: The motif-aligned structure (score $-5$) is preferred over the no-gap structure (score $-9$).\n- **BLOSUM-like Scoring**: The no-gap structure (score $+11$) is preferred over the motif-aligned structure (score $+7$).\n- **Biological Relevance**: The problem states that biological relevance requires the $\\text{RGD}$ motif to be aligned. Therefore, the identity scoring system produces the more biologically relevant alignment in this specific case, whereas the BLOSUM-like scheme with its high gap penalty fails to do so.\n\nWe now evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n\n- **A.** \"Under the identity scoring, the optimal alignment introduces gaps to align RGD exactly and achieves a higher score than the best no-gap alignment; under the BLOSUM-like scheme with $g'=-6$, the optimal alignment avoids gaps, keeps the hydrophobic block aligned, and leaves RGD misaligned because this yields a higher score. Thus, the identity-scored alignment is more biologically relevant.\"\n  This statement is entirely consistent with our findings. The first part is correct (motif-aligned preferred by identity scoring). The second part is correct (no-gap preferred by BLOSUM-like scoring). The conclusion about biological relevance is also correct based on the problem's definition. This option is **Correct**.\n\n- **B.** \"Both scoring schemes choose the same optimal alignment that aligns RGD exactly; neither scheme offers an advantage.\"\n  This is false. The two schemes prefer different alignment structures. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C.** \"Under the identity scoring, the optimal alignment avoids gaps and misaligns RGD; under the BLOSUM-like scheme, the optimal alignment aligns RGD exactly even if it must introduce gaps. Thus, the BLOSUM-like scheme is more biologically relevant.\"\n  This statement is the exact opposite of our findings for both scoring systems. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D.** \"Neither scheme can distinguish between RGD-aligned and RGD-misaligned alternatives because their scores tie under both schemes.\"\n  The scores are not tied in either case ($-5 \\neq -9$ and $+7 \\neq +11$). This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2395031"}]}
