We must find the exact probability of a net change $\\Delta = N_1 - N_0 = r_C = -5$.\nA key property of Poisson processes states that if a Poisson-distributed number of individuals are independently subjected to a multinomial classification, the number of individuals in each resulting category are independent Poisson random variables.\nLet $N_d$, $N_m$, and $N_s$ be the number of initial cells that divide, die, and survive. Then:\n$N_d \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_d = \\lambda_0 p_d = 200 \\cdot 0.04 = 8)$\n$N_m \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_m = \\lambda_0 p_m = 200 \\cdot 0.06 = 12)$\n$N_s \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_s = \\lambda_0 p_s = 200 \\cdot 0.9 = 180)$\nThe total population sizes are $N_0 = N_d + N_m + N_s$ and $N_1 = 2N_d + 1N_s + 0N_m$.\nThe net change is $\\Delta = N_1 - N_0 = (2N_d + N_s) - (N_d + N_m + N_s) = N_d - N_m$.\nWe need to find $P(N_d - N_m = -5)$. The difference of two independent Poisson random variables follows a Skellam distribution. Let $Y = N_d - N_m$. Then $Y \\sim \\text{Skellam}(\\mu_1=\\lambda_d, \\mu_2=\\lambda_m)$.\nWe require the probability $P(Y = -5)$ with parameters $\\mu_1 = 8$ and $\\mu_2 = 12$. The probability mass function of the Skellam distribution is $P(Y=k) = e^{-(\\mu_1+\\mu_2)} (\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\mu_2})^{k/2} I_{|k|}(2\\sqrt{\\mu_1\\mu_2})$, where $I_{|k|}$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. Using a computational library to evaluate this function for $k=-5$, $\\mu_1=8$, and $\\mu_2=12$ yields $P(\\Delta = -5) \\approx 0.064560$.\n\nCase D: The initial population is $N_0 = n_0 = 25$, with $p_d=0$ and $p_m=0.1$. The survival probability is $p_s = 1 - 0 - 0.1 = 0.9$. We must find the exact probability that $N_1 = k_D = 22$.\nSince $p_d=0$, no cells divide. A cell either survives (with probability $0.9$) or dies (with probability $0.1$). The final population size $N_1$ is simply the number of cells that survive. This is a classic binomial trials problem. The number of surviving cells, $S$, follows a binomial distribution:\n$$S \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=n_0, p=p_s) = \\text{Binomial}(n=25, p=0.9)$$\nWe need to compute $P(N_1=22) = P(S=22)$.
