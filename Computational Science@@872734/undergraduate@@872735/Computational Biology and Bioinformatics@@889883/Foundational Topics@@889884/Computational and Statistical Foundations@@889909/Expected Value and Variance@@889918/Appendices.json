The initial read count, a random variable $X$, follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$. This is written as $X \\sim \\operatorname{Pois}(\\lambda)$.\n2. The expected read count for a gene scales linearly with sequencing depth.\n3. A new experiment is conducted where the sequencing depth is $3$ times the original depth.\n\nThese premises are standard and well-established in the field of computational biology for analyzing RNA-seq data. The model is scientifically grounded and the problem is well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the original sequencing depth be denoted by $D$. The initial read count is the random variable $X$, and it is given that $X \\sim \\operatorname{Pois}(\\lambda)$. The fundamental properties of the Poisson distribution state that its expected value and variance are both equal to its parameter. Therefore, for the initial experiment, we have:\n$$\nE[X] = \\lambda\n$$\n$$\nVar(X) = \\lambda\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the expected count is directly proportional to the sequencing depth. We can express this relationship mathematically with a constant of proportionality, $k$, which depends on the specific gene and fixed experimental conditions.\n$$\nE[X] = kD\n$$\nFrom this, we can equate the two expressions for the expected value to relate the Poisson parameter $\\lambda$ to the sequencing depth $D$:\n$$\n\\lambda = kD\n$$\n\nNext, a new experiment is described. Let $X'$ be the random variable representing the read count from this new experiment. The new sequencing depth is $3$ times the original depth, which we denote as $D' = 3D$. The problem implies that the new count $X'$ also follows a Poisson distribution, consistent with the standard model. Let the parameter of this new distribution be $\\lambda'$. So, $X' \\sim \\operatorname{Pois}(\\lambda')$.\n\nWe apply the linear scaling assumption to the new experiment. The constant of proportionality $k$ remains the same because the gene and other conditions are unchanged. The new expected value is:\n$$\nE[X'] = kD' = k(3D)\n$$\nWe can rewrite this expression by grouping terms:\n$$\nE[X'] = 3(kD)\n$$\nSubstituting our earlier finding that $\\lambda = kD$, we determine the new expected value in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$\nE[X'] = 3\\lambda\n$$\n\nFor the new Poisson-distributed variable $X'$, its parameter $\\lambda'$ must be equal to its expected value. Thus:\n$$\n\\lambda' = E[X'] = 3\\lambda\n$$\nThe variance of the Poisson distribution is also equal to its parameter. Therefore, the variance of the new read count $X'$ is:\n$$\nVar(X') = \\lambda' = 3\\lambda\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the new expected value and variance, reported as a row vector $(E[X'], Var(X'))$.

Let $X$ be an indicator random variable such that $X=1$ if the bit is correctly recovered after both stages, and $X=0$ otherwise. The task is to find the expected total number of correctly recovered bits. Let this total be $S$. If we have $N$ bits, indexed by $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$, we can define an indicator variable $X_i$ for each bit. The total number of correct bits is $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of correct bits is:\n$$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince the error process is identical and independent for each bit, the expected value $E[X_i]$ is the same for all $i$. Let this common value be $E[X]$. Thus,\n$$E[S] = N \\cdot E[X]$$\nThe expected value of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Therefore, $E[X] = P(X=1)$, which is the probability that a single bit is correctly recovered.\n\nA bit is correctly recovered if the final reported bit is identical to the original intended bit. This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1. The bit is not flipped during synthesis AND is not flipped during sequencing. An even number of flips ($0$) occurs.\n2. The bit is flipped during synthesis AND is flipped again during sequencing. An even number of flips ($2$) occurs, returning the bit to its original state.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each case. The stages are independent.\n- The probability of the first case (no flip in either stage) is the product of the probabilities of no-flip in each stage:\n$$P(\\text{no flip, no flip}) = (1-p)(1-q)$$\n- The probability of the second case (flip in both stages) is the product of the probabilities of a flip in each stage:\n$$P(\\text{flip, flip}) = p \\cdot q$$\n\nThe total probability of a single bit being correctly recovered, $P(X=1)$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two disjoint events:\n$$P(X=1) = (1-p)(1-q) + pq$$\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$$P(X=1) = 1 - p - q + pq + pq = 1 - p - q + 2pq$$\n\nNow, we can compute the expected total number of correctly recovered bits, $E[S]$, by substituting the values of $N$ and $P(X=1)$:\n$$E[S] = N \\cdot P(X=1) = 8192 \\cdot (1 - p - q + 2pq)$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the expected number of correctly recovered bits in terms of the error probabilities $p$ and $q$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8192(1 - p - q + 2pq)}\n$$", "id": "2389185"}, {"introduction": "Understanding how mutations accumulate in our cells over a lifetime is a central question in cancer biology and aging.

The goal is to compute the expectation, $E[M_{total}]$.\n\nThe total number of mutations is the sum of mutations occurring at each division.
