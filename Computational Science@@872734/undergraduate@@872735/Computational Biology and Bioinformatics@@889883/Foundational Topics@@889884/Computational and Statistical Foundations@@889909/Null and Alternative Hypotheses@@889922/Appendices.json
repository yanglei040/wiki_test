This foundational exercise [@problem_id:1940634] will guide you through setting up these hypotheses for a classic directional test, providing a solid base for all future hypothesis testing.", "problem": "An ecologist is investigating the impact of industrial pollution on a local butterfly species. The ecologist hypothesizes that the chronic exposure to pollutants in a specific habitat has resulted in a reduction in the average size of the butterflies. To test this, the ecologist plans to collect two independent samples of butterflies: one from the polluted habitat and another from a nearby pristine, unpolluted habitat.\n\nLet $\\mu_{polluted}$ represent the true mean wingspan of the entire butterfly population in the polluted habitat, and let $\\mu_{pristine}$ represent the true mean wingspan of the entire butterfly population in the pristine habitat. The ecologist's research claim is that the mean wingspan in the polluted habitat is smaller than in the pristine habitat.\n\nBased on standard statistical practice for hypothesis testing, which of the following options correctly formulates the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) for this investigation?\n\nA. $H_0: \\mu_{polluted} = \\mu_{pristine}$; $H_1: \\mu_{polluted}  \\mu_{pristine}$\n\nB. $H_0: \\mu_{polluted}  \\mu_{pristine}$; $H_1: \\mu_{polluted} = \\mu_{pristine}$\n\nC. $H_0: \\mu_{polluted} = \\mu_{pristine}$; $H_1: \\mu_{polluted}  \\mu_{pristine}$\n\nD. $H_0: \\mu_{polluted} = \\mu_{pristine}$; $H_1: \\mu_{polluted} \\neq \\mu_{pristine}$\n\nE. $H_0: \\bar{x}_{polluted} = \\bar{x}_{pristine}$; $H_1: \\bar{x}_{polluted}  \\bar{x}_{pristine}$", "solution": "Define the population parameters as stated: $\\mu_{polluted}$ is the true mean wingspan in the polluted habitat, and $\\mu_{pristine}$ is the true mean wingspan in the pristine habitat.

A one-sided test is appropriate when you are only interested in an effect in a single direction, such as a drug *decreasing* the expression of an oncogene. This practice problem [@problem_id:2410281] presents a realistic scenario from drug discovery, where you must use the pre-specified decision-making criteria to justify and formulate the correct hypothesis for evaluating a drug's efficacy.", "problem": "A biotechnology company is evaluating a small molecule that targets a transcription factor known to activate an oncogene. In an in vitro experiment with human cancer cell lines, you perform ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq), normalize counts, and analyze log-base-two expression. Let $n_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{c}}$ denote the numbers of independent biological replicates under treatment and control, respectively, with $n_{\\mathrm{t}} = 6$ and $n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 6$. Let $\\mu_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}$ denote the population means of log-base-two expression for the oncogene under treatment and control, respectively, and let $\\Delta = \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}$ denote the population mean difference. After appropriate normalization and variance stabilization, you plan to conduct a parametric test on $\\Delta$ at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nThe company’s pre-registered primary decision rule for the go/no-go decision is: proceed to animal studies only if there is statistically significant evidence that the oncogene’s mean expression is lower under treatment than under control. If expression is higher under treatment, this will be investigated in a separate safety analysis but will not count toward the primary endpoint or alter the go/no-go rule for efficacy. You will not reinterpret an unexpected increase in expression as “success.”\n\nFrom first principles of hypothesis testing in computational biology and bioinformatics, where the null hypothesis represents no efficacy-relevant effect and the alternative represents the effect of interest, which option correctly specifies whether the primary alternative hypothesis should be one-sided or two-sided for the oncogene’s expression, and correctly states both the one-sided and two-sided null/alternative hypothesis pairs in terms of $\\Delta$?\n\nA. Use a one-sided alternative focused on downregulation for the primary test because only a decrease in expression is efficacy-relevant under the pre-registered decision rule. One-sided: $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ge 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta  0$. Two-sided (for comparison): $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta = 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ne 0$.\n\nB. Use a two-sided alternative for the primary test because two-sided tests maximize power at fixed $\\alpha$. One-sided (for comparison): $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ge 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta  0$. Two-sided: $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta = 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ne 0$.\n\nC. Use a one-sided alternative for the primary test because the drug is expected to inhibit.

The rule states that the project will proceed only if there is \"statistically significant evidence that the oncogene’s mean expression is lower under treatment than under control.\"\n\n1.  **Identify the Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$)**: The alternative hypothesis represents the \"effect of interest\" or the discovery the researchers hope to make. In this case, the effect of interest is that the treatment lowers expression. Mathematically, this is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{t}}  \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}$. In terms of the defined parameter $\\Delta = \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}$, this translates to $\\Delta  0$. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis is $H_A: \\Delta  0$. This is a one-sided (directional) hypothesis.\n\n2.  **Identify the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The null hypothesis represents the state of \"no efficacy-relevant effect.\" It is the complement of the alternative hypothesis. If $H_A$ is $\\Delta  0$, then $H_0$ must cover all other possibilities: that the drug has no effect ($\\Delta = 0$) or that it increases expression ($\\Delta  0$). Combined, this is $\\Delta \\ge 0$. So, the null hypothesis is $H_0: \\Delta \\ge 0$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Test**: The correct hypothesis pair is a one-sided test: $H_0: \\Delta \\ge 0$ versus $H_A: \\Delta  0$. A one-sided test is necessary because the decision rule is directional—only a decrease in expression counts as success. An increase in expression would lead to a \"no-go\" decision, the same outcome as no effect.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n- **A**: Correctly identifies the need for a one-sided test based on the decision rule. It correctly states the one-sided pair as $H_0: \\Delta \\ge 0$ versus $H_A: \\Delta  0$. The comparative two-sided test is also stated correctly. This option is fully correct.\n- **B**: Incorrectly suggests a two-sided test. Its justification is also false; a one-sided test has more power to detect an effect in the specified direction.\n- **C**: Correctly chooses a one-sided test but formulates the hypotheses in the wrong direction ($H_A: \\Delta > 0$), which would test for an *increase* in expression.\n- **D**: Incorrectly suggests a two-sided test. Its justification regarding multiple-testing correction is also false; correction methods can be applied to p-values from one-sided tests.\n\nTherefore, Option A provides the correct justification and formulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2410281"}, {"introduction": "A common challenge in genomics is that with large datasets, even biologically trivial effects can become statistically significant.
