It is also implicit that target genes do not regulate the master regulator, as no such edges are mentioned. The out-degree is the size of the adjacency list of outgoing neighbors.

The pair is $(1, 1)$.\n\nBoth graphs possess one vertex with the degree pair $(2, 2)$ and four vertices with the degree pair $(1, 1)$. Since an isomorphism must preserve the degree pair of each vertex, any isomorphism $f: V_{\\mathcal{A}} \\to V_{\\mathcal{B}}$ must map the unique vertex of type $(2, 2)$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ to the unique vertex of type $(2, 2)$ in $\\mathcal{B}$.\nTherefore, for any isomorphism $f$, it must be that $f(A_1) = B_1$.\n\nWith the mapping of $A_1$ fixed, we must consider the mapping of the remaining vertices. An isomorphism preserves neighborhoods. The set of out-neighbors of $A_1$, which is $N^{+}(A_1) = \\{A_2, A_3\\}$, must be mapped to the set of out-neighbors of $f(A_1) = B_1$, which is $N^{+}(B_1) = \\{B_2, B_3\\}$.

Assume $f(A_2) = B_2$ and $f(A_3) = B_3$.\nThe edge $A_2 \\to A_4$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ must correspond to an edge $f(A_2) \\to f(A_4)$ in $\\mathcal{B}$, which is $B_2 \\to f(A_4)$. In graph $\\mathcal{B}$, the only outgoing edge from $B_2$ is $B_2 \\to B_5$. Thus, we must have $f(A_4) = B_5$.\nSimilarly, the edge $A_3 \\to A_5$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ must correspond to an edge $f(A_3) \\to f(A_5)$ in $\\mathcal{B}$, which is $B_3 \\to f(A_5)$. The only outgoing edge from $B_3$ is $B_3 \\to B_4$. Thus, we must have $f(A_5) = B_4$.\nThis completely determines a potential isomorphism, which we will call $f_1$:\n$f_1(A_1)=B_1, f_1(A_2)=B_2, f_1(A_3)=B_3, f_1(A_4)=B_5, f_1(A_5)=B_4$.\nWe must verify that this is a valid isomorphism by checking that all $6$ edges of $\\mathcal{A}$ map to the $6$ edges of $\\mathcal{B}$.\n- $A_1 \\to A_2 \\implies B_1 \\to B_2$ (exists)\n- $A_1 \\to A_3 \\implies B_1 \\to B_3$ (exists)\n- $A_2 \\to A_4 \\implies B_2 \\to B_5$ (exists)\n- $A_3 \\to A_5 \\implies B_3 \\to B_4$ (exists)\n- $A_4 \\to A_1 \\implies B_5 \\to B_1$ (exists)\n- $A_5 \\to A_1 \\implies B_4 \\to B_1$ (exists)\nSince $f_1$ is a bijection and correctly maps all edges from $\\mathcal{A}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and both graphs have the same number of edges, $f_1$ is a valid isomorphism. This provides one such mapping.\n\nNow, let us analyze the second case. Assume $f(A_2) = B_3$ and $f(A_3) = B_2$.\nThe edge $A_2 \\to A_4$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ must map to $f(A_2) \\to f(A_4)$, which is $B_3 \\to f(A_4)$. The only outgoing edge from $B_3$ is $B_3 \\to B_4$. Hence, $f(A_4) = B_4$.\nThe edge $A_3 \\to A_5$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ must map to $f(A_3) \\to f(A_5)$, which is $B_2 \\to f(A_5)$. The only outgoing edge from $B_2$ is $B_2 \\to B_5$. Hence, $f(A_5) = B_5$.\nThis determines a second potential isomorphism, $f_2$:\n$f_2(A_1)=B_1, f_2(A_2)=B_3, f_2(A_3)=B_2, f_2(A_4)=B_4, f_2(A_5)=B_5$.\nWe verify this mapping:\n- $A_1 \\to A_2 \\implies B_1 \\to B_3$ (exists)\n- $A_1 \\to A_3 \\implies B_1 \\to B_2$ (exists)\n- $A_2 \\to A_4 \\implies B_3 \\to B_4$ (exists)\n- $A_3 \\to A_5 \\implies B_2 \\to B_5$ (exists)\n- $A_4 \\to A_1 \\implies B_4 \\to B_1$ (exists)\n- $A_5 \\to A_1 \\implies B_5 \\to B_1$ (exists)\nThis mapping $f_2$ is also a valid isomorphism. This gives a second distinct mapping.\n\nThese two cases exhaust all possibilities originating from the initial constraint $f(A_1) = B_1$ and the subsequent choices for its neighbors. The structural symmetry of the two cycles branching from the central node ($A_1$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ and $B_1$ in $\\mathcal{B}$) is the origin of these two distinct possibilities. The two cycles, one involving $\\{A_2, A_4\\}$ and the other $\\{A_3, A_5\\}$, are structurally indistinguishable, which allows for an isomorphism to effectively swap them.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two distinct directed graph isomorphisms from $\\mathcal{A}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2395772"}]}
