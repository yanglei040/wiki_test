This exercise explores this fundamental concept by having you calculate the isoelectric point ($pI$), the specific pH at which an amino acid carries no net electrical charge.

The isoelectric point ($pI$) of a molecule is the specific pH at which its net electrical charge is zero. In a typical IEF setup, a pH gradient is established in a gel matrix. When a sample is applied, each molecule migrates through the gradient until it reaches the pH corresponding to its $pI$, where it ceases to move.\n\nA researcher is planning an experiment to separate a mixture of amino acids and wants to predict the final position of Histidine in the IEF gel.

The $pI$ occurs when the average charge is zero, which is achieved when the concentrations of the $+1$ and $-1$ forms are equal, i.e., $[X^{+}] = [Y^{-}]$, because the neutral form carries no charge.\n\nThe relevant equilibria and Henderson–Hasselbalch relations are:\n$$\npH = pKa_{R} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[Z^{0}]}{[X^{+}]}\\right), \\quad\npH = pKa_{2} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[Y^{-}]}{[Z^{0}]}\\right).\n$$\nMultiplying the corresponding ratios gives\n$$\n\\frac{[Y^{-}]}{[X^{+}]} = 10^{\\left(pH - pKa_{R}\\right)} \\cdot 10^{\\left(pH - pKa_{2}\\right)} = 10^{\\,2\\,pH - \\left(pKa_{R} + pKa_{2}\\right)}.\n$$\nAt $pI$, impose $[Y^{-}] = [X^{+}]$, hence\n$$\n10^{\\,2\\,pH - \\left(pKa_{R} + pKa_{2}\\right)} = 1 \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; 2\\,pH - \\left(pKa_{R} + pKa_{2}\\right) = 0,\n$$\nso\n$$\npI = \\frac{pKa_{R} + pKa_{2}}{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\npI = \\frac{6.00 + 9.17}{2} = 7.585 \\approx 7.59 \\text{ (to three significant figures).}\n$$\nThe $\\alpha$-carboxyl $pKa_{1}$ does not enter this average because the neutral (zwitterionic) form of histidine lies between $pKa_{R}$ and $pKa_{2}$ on the titration curve.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.59}$$", "id": "2303334"}, {"introduction": "While properties like charge and hydrophobicity are important, the three-dimensional structure of a protein is also governed by the specific size and conformational freedom of each amino acid residue. Glycine, with its single hydrogen atom as a side chain, is unique in its flexibility and is often found in tight turns where other, bulkier residues would not fit. This thought experiment challenges you to analyze the structural consequences of mutating a critical glycine, providing insight into the role of steric constraints in protein folding and stability [@problem_id:2303354].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying a small, globular protein named \"flexilin.\" A critical structural feature of flexilin is a sharp U-shaped bend in its polypeptide backbone known as a beta-turn. This turn is essential for the protein to fold into its correct three-dimensional, functional conformation. Sequence analysis reveals that a glycine residue is located at a position within this beta-turn that requires a particularly sharp angle. A point mutation is introduced, changing this specific glycine residue to a valine residue. The resulting mutant protein is found to be unstable and misfolded.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and direct biochemical explanation for why this Gly-to-Val mutation disrupts the protein's structure?\n\nA. Valine has a bulky, branched side chain that creates steric hindrance within the constrained space of the beta-turn, preventing the polypeptide backbone from adopting the necessary dihedral angles.\n\nB. Valine is significantly more hydrophobic than glycine, causing the loop region to be incorrectly drawn into the protein's hydrophobic core.\n\nC. The loss of glycine's positively charged side chain disrupts an essential salt bridge that stabilizes the turn.\n\nD. The valine side chain is incapable of forming the specific hydrogen bonds that the original glycine side chain was forming to stabilize the turn.\n\nE. Glycine is the most conformationally rigid amino acid, and its replacement with the more flexible valine removes the structural stability of the turn.", "solution": "We begin by recalling that a beta-turn is a tight reversal in the polypeptide chain that requires specific backbone dihedral angles, typically involving residues that can adopt unusual values of the Ramachandran dihedral angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$. Glycine is frequently found in beta-turns because its side chain is a single hydrogen atom, which eliminates a $C_{\\beta}$ substituent and thereby minimizes steric hindrance with the backbone. This minimal steric bulk allows glycine to sample regions of $\\phi,\\psi$ space that are sterically inaccessible to most other amino acids, including conformations with positive $\\phi$ that are often required at certain positions in beta-turns.\n\nValine, by contrast, is $\\beta$-branched and carries a bulky, branched isopropyl side chain at the $C_{\\beta}$ position. This branching introduces significant steric hindrance between the side chain and backbone atoms, which restricts the allowed $\\phi,\\psi$ conformations. Substituting glycine with valine at a position that demands a particularly sharp turn imposes steric clashes in the constrained geometry of the beta-turn, preventing the backbone from adopting the necessary dihedral angles and thereby destabilizing the local structure and the protein fold.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A: Correct. It directly identifies the key biochemical mechanism: valine’s bulky, branched side chain causes steric hindrance that prevents the required $\\phi,\\psi$ angles in a tight beta-turn.\n- B: Incorrect as the primary explanation. Although valine is more hydrophobic, the principal determinant for glycine at beta-turn hotspots is conformational flexibility and steric permissiveness, not hydrophobic burial. Loop regions are often solvent-exposed, and a single valine is unlikely to drive major hydrophobic collapse compared to the steric constraints.\n- C: Incorrect. Glycine does not have a positively charged side chain; it has no side chain beyond hydrogen and is uncharged at physiological pH. There is no salt bridge lost from glycine’s side chain.\n- D: Incorrect. Glycine’s side chain cannot form hydrogen bonds; stabilization of beta-turns primarily involves backbone hydrogen bonds, which are still available with valine. The key difference here is steric and conformational, not side-chain hydrogen bonding capability.\n- E: Incorrect. Glycine is the most conformationally flexible (not rigid) amino acid because it lacks a $C_{\\beta}$ substituent; replacing it with the more restricted, $\\beta$-branched valine reduces flexibility and introduces steric clashes.\n\nThus, the most accurate and direct biochemical explanation is steric hindrance preventing the required dihedral angles, as stated in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2303354"}, {"introduction": "Computational biology often relies on simplified models to capture the essential physics of complex processes like protein folding.

This is a coarse-grained approximation of solvation free energy contributions.\n- We represent a polymer conformation as a self-avoiding walk on the two-dimensional square lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.

Then $E(f) = -C(f)$.\n- Correctness:\n  - The DFS enumerates exactly the set of self-avoiding walks under the anchoring constraint and therefore explores all conformations modulo global rotations (which do not change $C(f)$). Because every feasible $f$ is evaluated and $E(f)$ is computed from first principles as the negative of hydrophobic contacts between nonconsecutive adjacent residues, the minimum over all enumerated conformations is $E_{\\min}(S)$ by definition.\n- Complexity considerations:\n  - The number of self-avoiding walks of length $n$ on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ grows approximately as $A \\cdot \\mu^n$ with connective constant $\\mu \\approx 2.638$. Here $n = N-1$. For $N \\le 9$ in the test suite, exhaustive enumeration is computationally feasible, especially with the rotational symmetry fixed by $f(1) = (1,0)$.\n- Boundary cases:\n  - If $N = 1$, there are no pairs and thus $C(f) = 0$ for the single conformation $f(0) = (0,0)$, so $E_{\\min} = 0$.\n  - If $N = 2$, only the consecutive pair exists, which is excluded by $\\lvert i-j \\rvert  1$, so again $E_{\\min} = 0$.\n  - For $N = 4$ and $S = \\text{\"HHHH\"}$, a $2 \\times 2$ square conformation exists with two nonconsecutive hydrophobic contacts, yielding $E_{\\min} \\le -2$; exhaustive enumeration confirms optimality.\n\nImplementation plan:\n- Hard-code the test suite sequences $S_1$ through $S_6$.\n- For each $S_k$, run the DFS enumerator to determine $E_{\\min}(S_k)$.\n- Print a single line containing the results in order as a list $\\left[ E_{\\min}(S_1), E_{\\min}(S_2), \\dots, E_{\\min}(S_6) \\right]$.\n\nThis approach follows directly from the foundational definitions of the HP model on a lattice, uses no heuristic shortcuts, and fully explores the discrete conformation space required to certify the minimal energy values for the provided test cases.", "answer": "[0,0,-2,0,-3,-4]", "id": "2371271"}]}
