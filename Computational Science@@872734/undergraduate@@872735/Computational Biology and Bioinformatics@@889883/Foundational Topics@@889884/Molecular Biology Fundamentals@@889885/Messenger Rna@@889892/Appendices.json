By applying dynamic programming, you will quantify key metrics such as the most probable isoform ($P_{\\max}$) and exon inclusion probabilities ($\\pi_k$), fundamental tasks in modern transcriptomics. [@problem_id:2404500]", "problem": "You are modeling messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing as a directed acyclic graph where exons are nodes in $5'$ to $3'$ order and introns correspond to edges with efficiencies.

A valid splice isoform corresponds to any directed path from exon $1$ to exon $N$. The path probability of a specific path is defined as the product of the edge weights along the path. Assume independence of intron splicing events across edges.\n\nFor each test case below, given $N$ and the weighted edge set $E$, compute the following quantities:\n\n1.

It presents a well-posed computational task on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a standard model for alternative splicing in computational biology. The definitions of all quantities to be computed are mathematically precise, and the problem is free from scientific inaccuracies, ambiguities, or contradictions. The problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming, leveraging the topological ordering of the exons (nodes).\n\nThe solution involves three main computational steps performed on the graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V=\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ and an edge $(i, j)$ implies $i<j$. We will utilize 0-based indexing in our arrays, so node $k$ in the problem corresponds to index $k-1$.\n\n1.  **Maximum Path Probability ($P_{\\max}$)**\n\n    The maximum path probability from exon $1$ to exon $N$ can be found using a dynamic programming approach similar to finding the longest path in a DAG. Let $P_{\\max}(i)$ be the maximum path probability from the start exon $1$ to exon $i$. We seek to compute $P_{\\max}(N)$.\n\n    -   **Base Case**: The path from exon $1$ to itself has no edges, so its probability product is $1$. Thus, $P_{\\max}(1) = 1$. For any other node $i$ not reachable from $1$, $P_{\\max}(i)$ is implicitly $0$.\n\n    -   **Recurrence**: For any exon $i > 1$, a path from $1$ to $i$ must arrive from a predecessor exon $j$ via an edge $(j, i)$. The maximum path probability to $i$ is the maximum over all its predecessors $j$ of the probability of the path to $j$ extended by the edge $(j, i)$. The exons are processed in their natural order from $1$ to $N$.\n        $$ P_{\\max}(i) = \\max_{j : (j, i) \\in E} \\{ P_{\\max}(j) \\cdot w_{ji} \\} $$\n        The final result is $P_{\\max} = P_{\\max}(N)$. If no path exists from $1$ to $N$, this value will be $0$.\n\n2.  **Total Path Mass ($M$)**\n\n    The total path mass $M$ is the sum of probabilities of all distinct paths from exon $1$ to exon $N$. This can also be computed using dynamic programming. Let $M_{fwd}(i)$ be the total mass of all paths from exon $1$ to exon $i$. We want to find $M = M_{fwd}(N)$.\n\n    -   **Base Case**: As before, there is a single path of length $0$ from $1$ to $1$ with probability $1$. So, $M_{fwd}(1) = 1$.\n\n    -   **Recurrence**: For any exon $i > 1$, the total mass at $i$ is the sum of masses contributed by all its predecessors. Each predecessor $j$ contributes its own total mass $M_{fwd}(j)$ multiplied by the weight of the edge $(j, i)$.\n        $$ M_{fwd}(i) = \\sum_{j : (j, i) \\in E} M_{fwd}(j) \\cdot w_{ji} $$\n        The final result is $M = M_{fwd}(N)$.\n\n3.  **Inclusion Probability ($\\pi_k$)**\n\n    The inclusion probability for an exon $k$, $\\pi_k$, is the total probability of all paths from $1$ to $N$ that pass through $k$, normalized by the total path mass $M$.\n    A path from $1$ to $N$ through $k$ can be seen as a concatenation of a path from $1$ to $k$ and a path from $k$ to $N$. Due to the independence of splicing events, the probability of such a composite path is the product of the probabilities of its constituent sub-paths.\n\n    The total mass of paths passing through $k$ is therefore the product of two quantities:\n    - The total mass of paths from $1$ to $k$: This is precisely $M_{fwd}(k)$, which we have already calculated.\n    - The total mass of paths from $k$ to $N$. Let's call this $M_{rev}(k)$.\n\n    The term $M_{rev}(k)$ can be calculated with a \"reverse\" dynamic programming pass, computing the total path mass from each exon $k$ to the final exon $N$.\n\n    -   **Base Case**: The total mass of paths from $N$ to itself is $1$, so $M_{rev}(N) = 1$.\n\n    -   **Recurrence**: For any exon $k < N$, a path starting at $k$ must proceed to a successor exon $j$. The total mass is the sum of contributions from all successors.\n        $$ M_{rev}(k) = \\sum_{j : (k, j) \\in E} w_{kj} \\cdot M_{rev}(j) $$\n        This recurrence is solved by processing exons in reverse order, from $N-1$ down to $1$.\n\n    Finally, the inclusion probability $\\pi_k$ is given by:\n    $$ \\pi_k = \\frac{M_{fwd}(k) \\cdot M_{rev}(k)}{M} $$\n    For this formula to be valid, we must have $M > 0$. By definition, for any path from $1$ to $N$, exons $1$ and $N$ must be included. It follows that $\\pi_1 = \\frac{M_{fwd}(1) \\cdot M_{rev}(1)}{M} = \\frac{1 \\cdot M}{M} = 1$ and $\\pi_N = \\frac{M_{fwd}(N) \\cdot M_{rev}(N)}{M} = \\frac{M \\cdot 1}{M} = 1$.\n\n    If $M=0$, indicating no path from $1$ to $N$ exists, the problem statement specifies that $P_{\\max}=0$ and $\\pi_k=0$ for all $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$.
