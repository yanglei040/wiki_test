This practice explores what happens when that sequence is disrupted by a small insertion, leading to a frameshift mutation. By analyzing the consequences of adding just two nucleotides, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the \"reading frame\"—the crucial triplet grouping of codons—and see how even minor changes can lead to a complete alteration of the resulting protein [@problem_id:2141980].", "problem": "Consider a gene within a eukaryotic organism that codes for a specific enzyme. The coding sequence of this gene, after being transcribed into messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA), is read by ribosomes in sequential, non-overlapping units of three nucleotides called codons. This \"reading frame\" begins at a specific start codon and determines the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein.\n\nImagine a mutational event where two adjacent nucleotide bases are inserted into the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence that corresponds to a position very early in the gene's coding region, just after the start codon. Assuming this mutation does not prevent the gene from being transcribed into mRNA, what is the most probable effect on the amino acid sequence of the protein synthesized from this mutated gene?\n\nA.

Each codon specifies one amino acid, and translation proceeds codon by codon.\n\nLet the original coding sequence be read in triplets as:\n$$[b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}]\\,[b_{4}b_{5}b_{6}]\\,[b_{7}b_{8}b_{9}]\\,\\dots$$\nwhere each bracketed group is a codon. An insertion of two adjacent bases immediately after the start codon increases the nucleotide count by two at that position. The reading frame is defined modulo three, so the effect of an insertion of length $k$ on the reading frame is determined by $k \\bmod 3$. If $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, the frame is preserved; if $k \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, all downstream codons are regrouped, causing a frameshift.\n\nHere, $k=2$, so $2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, and the reading frame shifts by two nucleotides from the point of insertion onward. Consequently, the identity of every downstream codon changes, altering the encoded amino acids starting at the insertion site. Because the new reading frame is effectively random with respect to the original, it has a high probability of encountering a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) relatively soon. This is especially likely since the insertion occurs early in the coding region, making premature termination likely and producing a truncated, nonfunctional protein.\n\nEvaluation of options based on these principles:\n- A is incorrect because a frameshift from a two-base insertion does not typically affect only a single amino acid; it alters all downstream codons.\n- B is incorrect because adding two nucleotides does not preserve the frame or simply add two amino acids; restoration of the original sequence length without frameshift would require insertion of a multiple of three nucleotides.\n- C is correct: a two-base insertion causes a frameshift, altering the amino acid sequence from the insertion onward and likely introducing a premature stop codon.\n- D is incorrect because a silent outcome is highly unlikely for a two-base insertion; silent changes typically involve single-nucleotide substitutions that do not alter the encoded amino acid.\n- E is incorrect because inserting two nucleotides does not restore the frame after two extra amino acids; restoration requires an insertion or deletion whose length is a multiple of three.\n\nTherefore, the most probable effect is a frameshift that alters the sequence from the point of insertion with likely premature termination.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2141980"}, {"introduction": "The genetic code is redundant, meaning multiple codons can specify the same amino acid. This can lead to \"silent\" mutations that leave the primary protein sequence unchanged. This thought-provoking exercise challenges the oversimplified view that such mutations have no effect, prompting you to explore more subtle molecular mechanisms like codon usage bias and its influence on translation speed, protein folding, and ultimate protein abundance [@problem_id:2141999].", "problem": "In a molecular biology experiment, a researcher introduces a point mutation into the middle of the protein-coding sequence of a gene for a specific enzyme. The mutation is found to be \"synonymous\" (or \"silent\"), meaning it changes one codon into another that codes for the same amino acid. For example, a change from the codon `GCU` to `GCC` would still result in the incorporation of Alanine.\n\nDespite the primary amino-acid sequence of the enzyme remaining completely unchanged, the researcher observes a significant decrease in the total cellular concentration of the functional enzyme compared to cells expressing the original, un-mutated gene.\n\nAssuming the mutation did not occur within a sequence that regulates messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) splicing and that there are no other mutations, which of the following statements provides the most plausible molecular explanation for the observed reduction in protein quantity?\n\nA. The mutation alters the DNA structure in a way that prevents RNA polymerase from effectively transcribing the gene.\n\nB. The mutation changes the overall electrical charge of the mRNA molecule, causing it to be repelled from the ribosome's surface.\n\nC. A synonymous mutation cannot, by definition, alter the quantity of a protein; the observation is likely due to an unrecognized experimental error.\n\nD. The mutation changed a codon that is translated quickly by the cell into a different, but still synonymous, codon that is translated much more slowly, leading to ribosome pausing and potential degradation of the mRNA or the nascent protein.\n\nE. The mutation interferes with post-translational modification processes, causing the newly synthesized protein to be recognized as foreign and immediately destroyed.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most plausible mechanism by which a synonymous mutation in a coding sequence can lead to a decrease in the functional protein product, even though the amino acid sequence is identical.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the core concept. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that multiple codons can specify the same amino acid. A mutation that changes a codon to a synonymous one (e.g., `UCU` to `UCC`, both for Serine) is called a silent or synonymous mutation. The central dogma predicts this should not affect the final protein. However, cellular processes are more nuanced. We must evaluate each option to see which one describes a valid biological mechanism that could explain the observation.\n\nOption A suggests an effect on transcription. While a change in DNA sequence can theoretically affect the physical properties of the double helix, a single point mutation in the middle of a coding region is extremely unlikely to have a significant impact on the binding or processivity of RNA polymerase, which acts primarily at the promoter region located far upstream. Therefore, a major decrease in protein level due to this mechanism is not plausible.\n\nOption B suggests that a change in the mRNA's overall charge repels the ribosome. An mRNA molecule's charge is determined by its phosphate backbone. A single nucleotide change (e.g., A to G) does not alter the net charge of the molecule. Therefore, this option is based on a false premise.\n\nOption C claims that a synonymous mutation cannot have an effect. This statement is a common oversimplification. While the primary sequence is unchanged, modern molecular biology has revealed several mechanisms by which \"silent\" mutations can have significant phenotypic consequences. This contradicts the premise of the problem and ignores established biological phenomena. Thus, it is an unlikely explanation.\n\nOption E suggests an interference with post-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs, such as phosphorylation or glycosylation, occur at specific amino acid residues (e.g., Serine, Tyrosine). Since the synonymous mutation does not change the amino acid sequence, the sites for PTMs remain identical. This mechanism is therefore invalid.\n\nOption D presents a well-documented phenomenon known as **codon usage bias**. Not all synonymous codons are used with equal frequency in an organism. Some codons, known as \"common\" or \"optimal\" codons, correspond to abundant species of transfer RNA (tRNA). Ribosomes can translate these codons quickly. Other codons, known as \"rare\" or \"non-optimal\" codons, correspond to low-abundance tRNAs. When a ribosome encounters a rare codon, it must wait longer for the correct tRNA to become available. This slowing of translation, or ribosome pausing, can have several negative consequences:\n1.  **Protein Misfolding**: The timing of translation can be critical for correct co-translational folding, where the protein begins to fold as it emerges from the ribosome. A significant pause can alter this delicate timing, leading to a misfolded, non-functional protein which is then targeted for degradation by the cell's quality control machinery (e.g., the proteasome).\n2.  **mRNA Degradation**: Prolonged ribosome stalling can be recognized by cellular surveillance systems (like No-Go Decay or NGD) as a sign of a faulty mRNA molecule. These systems can trigger the cleavage and rapid degradation of the mRNA, preventing any further synthesis of the protein from that transcript.\n\nTherefore, a mutation that changes a common codon to a rare one can significantly reduce the output of functional protein by either promoting misfolding and degradation of the polypeptide or by leading to the destruction of the mRNA template itself. This mechanism provides a direct and plausible explanation for the researcher's observations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2141999"}]}
