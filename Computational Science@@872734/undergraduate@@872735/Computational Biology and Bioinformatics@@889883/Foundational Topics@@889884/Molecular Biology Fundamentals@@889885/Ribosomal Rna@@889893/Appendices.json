It provides a simplified but consistent thermodynamic model for the folding of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragments. All parameters, constraints, and objectives are specified with sufficient rigor to permit a unique and verifiable solution. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a computational solution is warranted.\n\nThe central task is to enumerate all possible pseudoknot-free secondary structures for a given RNA sequence, calculate the Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G_f$) for each, and identify the most stable configurations. Given the small length of the provided sequences (at most $n=12$ nucleotides), a direct approach of recursive enumeration with memoization is computationally feasible and more straightforward to implement correctly than a complex dynamic programming formulation tailored to this specific, simplified energy model.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, we define a recursive function, let us denote it $\\Phi(i, j)$, which generates the set of all valid secondary structures for the subsequence $x_i, \\dots, x_j$. A structure is mathematically a set of pairs $(p, q)$ representing base pairings, where $i \\le p  q \\le j$. To adhere to the non-crossing (pseudoknot-free) constraint, this function operates on the principle of decomposition:\n\n1.  A structure on $x_i, \\dots, x_j$ either leaves the nucleotide $x_j$ unpaired, or it pairs $x_j$ with some nucleotide $x_k$ where $i \\le k  j$.\n2.  If $x_j$ is unpaired, the set of possible structures is identical to that for the subsequence $x_i, \\dots, x_{j-1}$, which is given by $\\Phi(i, j-1)$.\n3.  If $x_j$ is paired with $x_k$ (where $(x_k, x_j)$ is an allowed pair and $j-k-1 \\ge m=3$), the non-crossing constraint dictates that the overall structure is a combination of a structure on the subsequence \"to the left\" of the pair, $x_i, \\dots, x_{k-1}$, and a structure on the subsequence \"inside\" the pair, $x_{k+1}, \\dots, x_{j-1}$. All combinations of valid substructures from these two regions, obtained from $\\Phi(i, k-1)$ and $\\Phi(k+1, j-1)$ respectively, are generated and combined with the new pair $(k, j)$.\n\nThe recursion's base case is a subsequence too short to form a hairpin loop ($j-i-1  m$), for which the only valid structure is the empty one with no pairs. The results of $\\Phi(i, j)$ are memoized to avoid redundant computations for overlapping subproblems.\n\nSecond, for each enumerated structure $S$, we compute its Gibbs free energy of folding, $\\Delta G_f(S)$, strictly following the provided formula:\n$$\n\\Delta G_f(S)\n=\n\\sum_{(i,j)\\in \\mathcal{P}(S)} e(x_i,x_j)\n\\;+\\;\n\\sum_{(i,j)\\in \\mathcal{H}(S)} h(j-i-1)\n\\;+\\;\n\\sum_{(i,j)\\in \\mathcal{T}(S)} s_{\\text{stack}}.\n$$\nThe calculation for a given structure $S$, represented as a set of pairs $\\mathcal{P}(S)$, is performed by iterating through each pair $(i, j) \\in \\mathcal{P}(S)$ and applying the following logic:\n- The base-pair stabilization energy $e(x_i, x_j)$ is always added.\n- The stacking bonus $s_{\\text{stack}} = -0.5$ is added if the adjacent inner pair $(i+1, j-1)$ is also a member of $\\mathcal{P}(S)$.\n- The hairpin loop penalty $h(j-i-1)$ is added if and only if the pair $(i, j)$ is a hairpin-closing pair, meaning there exists no other pair $(p, q) \\in \\mathcal{P}(S)$ such that $i  p  q  j$. This condition is checked for each pair.\n\nThe structure with no pairs, $\\mathcal{P}(S) = \\emptyset$, is always a possibility, and its energy is $\\Delta G_f = 0.0$.\n\nFinally, for each input sequence, the computed energies from all possible structures are collected.

If a predicted base pair in an rRNA helix is truly essential, evolution will often preserve the pairing even as the specific nucleotides change. This practice challenges you to validate predicted helices by searching for Compensatory Base-Pair Changes (CBCs) within a multiple sequence alignment, a 'smoking gun' that provides strong evolutionary support for the structure. [@problem_id:2426467]", "problem": "Write a complete program that, given a fixed multiple sequence alignment of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and a fixed set of predicted helices, evaluates compensatory base-pair change (CBC) support for each helix and reports, for several threshold values, how many helices are validated.\n\nA multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is provided as $S$ aligned sequences of equal length $L$. All sequences are strings over the alphabet {A, C, G, U, -}, where the dash character denotes a gap. Consider a predicted helix to be a set of one or more base-paired alignment column index pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \\le i  j \\le L$, using $1$-based indexing.\n\nDefine the set of canonical base pairs $P$ as $P = \\{(A,U),(U,A),(G,C),(C,G),(G,U),(U,G)\\}$. For a given pair of alignment columns $(i,j)$ and a given sequence $k \\in \\{1,\\dots,S\\}$, let $x_k$ be the nucleotide at column $i$ and $y_k$ be the nucleotide at column $j$.

Angles and physical units are not applicable in this problem; all reported quantities are dimensionless integers.", "solution": "The problem requires the validation of predicted ribosomal RNA (rRNA) secondary structure helices based on evolutionary evidence from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Specifically, we must quantify the support for each predicted helix by counting Compensatory Base-pair Changes (CBCs) and then determine, for several given thresholds, how many helices meet the validation criterion.\n\nThe provided input consists of an MSA of $S=6$ rRNA sequences, each of length $L=12$, a set of $5$ predicted helices defined by pairs of alignment columns, and a set of $4$ integer thresholds for validation. All column indices are 1-based, which must be converted to $0$-based for computation.\n\nA fundamental concept is the set of canonical base pairs, defined as $P = \\{(A,U),(U,A),(G,C),(C,G),(G,U),(U,G)\\}$. For a given pair of alignment columns $(i,j)$ and a sequence $k$, the nucleotides $(x_k, y_k)$ at these columns form a canonical pairing state if $(x_k, y_k) \\in P$.\n\nThe core of the analysis lies in the definition of a Compensatory Base-pair Change (CBC). According to the problem statement, the CBC count for a column pair $(i,j)$ is the number of unordered pairs of sequences $\\{k,\\ell\\}$ from the MSA that satisfy two strict conditions:\n$1$. Both sequences must form a canonical pair at columns $(i,j)$: $(x_k, y_k) \\in P$ and $(x_{\\ell}, y_{\\ell}) \\in P$.\n$2$. The nucleotides at both positions must be different: $x_k \\ne x_{\\ell}$ and $y_k \\ne y_{\\ell}$. This requires a coordinated change at both sites, for example, from $(G,C)$ to $(A,U)$ or from $(G,C)$ to $(C,G)$, but not from $(G,C)$ to $(G,U)$ as the first base is unchanged.\n\nThe total support for a helix, $\\mathrm{CBC\\_total}$, is the sum of the CBC counts for all column pairs $(i_m, j_m)$ that constitute the helix: $\\mathrm{CBC\\_total} = \\sum_{m=1}^{H_{\\text{pairs}}} \\mathrm{CBC}(i_m,j_m)$. Finally, a helix is considered validated at a threshold $t$ if its total support meets or exceeds this value, i.e., $\\mathrm{CBC\\_total} \\ge t$.\n\nThe solution follows a systematic, multi-step algorithm:\n\nFirst, we process the input data. The MSA is stored as an array of strings. The set of helices is stored as a list of lists of 1-based index pairs. The set of canonical pairs $P$ is stored in a hash set for efficient $O(1)$ lookups.\n\nSecond, for each relevant pair of alignment columns $(i,j)$ defined in the helices, we compute its CBC count. A computationally efficient method is employed:\n$1$. For a given column pair $(i,j)$, iterate through all $S$ sequences in the MSA.\n$2$. For each sequence $k$, extract the nucleotide pair $(x_k, y_k)$. If this pair belongs to the set $P$, it is retained.\n$3$. A frequency map (a multiset) is constructed for all retained canonical pairs. This map, let us call it $M$, stores each unique canonical pair type found and the number of sequences in which it occurs.\n$4. $The CBC count is calculated by iterating over all unordered pairs of distinct canonical pair types $\\{p_a, p_b\\}$ present as keys in the map $M$. Let $p_a = (x_a, y_a)$ and $p_b = (x_b, y_b)$. If the strict compensatory condition ($x_a \\ne x_b$ and $y_a \\ne y_b$) is satisfied, then these two types contribute to the CBC count. The number of CBCs formed between sequences of type $p_a$ and sequences of type $p_b$ is the product of their frequencies, $M[p_a] \\times M[p_b]$. The total CBC count for the column pair $(i,j)$ is the sum of these products over all qualifying pairs of pair types.\n\nThird, for each of the $5$ predicted helices, we calculate its total support, $\\mathrm{CBC\\_total}$, by summing the CBC counts computed in the previous step for all of its constituent column pairs.\n\nFourth, we evaluate the helices against the specified thresholds. For each threshold $t$ in the set $\\{5, 0, 1, 100\\}$, we iterate through the $5$ helices and count how many have a $\\mathrm{CBC\\_total}$ value greater than or equal to $t$.\n\nThis procedure yields a list of $4$ integer counts, corresponding to the number of validated helices for each threshold, which constitutes the final result.", "answer": "```python\nimport collections\n\n# There is no need for numpy or scipy for this problem, but the template requires this formatting.\n# import numpy as np\n# from scipy import ...\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the rRNA helix validation problem based on Compensatory Base-pair Changes (CBCs).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define Givens from the problem statement ---\n\n    # Multiple Sequence Alignment (S=6, L=12)\n    msa = [\n        \"AAGGG--UCCUU\",\n        \"GGAGG-ACCUCC\",\n        \"-UUGGC-UCAA-\",\n        \"-GGGG--GCUU-\",\n        \"-CCGGAUCCGG-\",\n        \"-AGGG--UCCU-\",\n    ]\n\n    # Predicted Helices (1-based indexing)\n    helices_1_based = {\n        1: [(2, 11), (3, 10)],\n        2: [(4, 9)],\n        3: [(5, 8)],\n        4: [(6, 7)],\n        5: [(1, 12)],\n    }\n    \n    # Convert helices to 0-based indexing for programming convenience\n    helices = {\n        name: [(i - 1, j - 1) for i, j in pairs]\n        for name, pairs in helices_1_based.items()\n    }\n\n    # Canonical Base Pairs\n    canonical_pairs = {\n        ('A', 'U'), ('U', 'A'),\n        ('G', 'C'), ('C', 'G'),\n        ('G', 'U'), ('U', 'G'),\n    }\n\n    # Test cases: Threshold values\n    thresholds = [5, 0, 1, 100]\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Implement the CBC calculation logic ---\n\n    def calculate_cbc_for_pair(col_i, col_j):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the CBC count for a single pair of alignment columns.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Extract pairs from the specified columns for all sequences\n        sequence_pairs = []\n        for seq in msa:\n            pair = (seq[col_i], seq[col_j])\n            if pair in canonical_pairs:\n                sequence_pairs.append(pair)\n\n        # If fewer than 2 sequences have canonical pairs, no CBC is possible.\n        if len(sequence_pairs)  2:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Create a frequency map of the canonical pairs found\n        pair_counts = collections.Counter(sequence_pairs)\n        \n        cbc_count = 0\n        \n        # Get the unique pair types\n        unique_pair_types = list(pair_counts.keys())\n        \n        # Iterate over all unordered pairs of distinct pair types\n        for i in range(len(unique_pair_types)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_pair_types)):\n                p_a = unique_pair_types[i]\n                p_b = unique_pair_types[j]\n                \n                x_a, y_a = p_a\n                x_b, y_b = p_b\n                \n                # Check for the strict CBC condition: x_k != x_l AND y_k != y_l\n                if x_a != x_b and y_a != y_b:\n                    # The number of CBCs between these two types is the product of their frequencies\n                    cbc_count += pair_counts[p_a] * pair_counts[p_b]\n                    \n        return cbc_count\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate total CBC support for each helix ---\n    \n    helix_total_cbcs = {}\n    for helix_name, column_pairs in helices.items():\n        total_cbc_for_helix = 0\n        for i, j in column_pairs:\n            total_cbc_for_helix += calculate_cbc_for_pair(i, j)\n        helix_total_cbcs[helix_name] = total_cbc_for_helix\n\n    # --- Step 4: Evaluate helices against thresholds and collect results ---\n\n    results = []\n    for t in thresholds:\n        validated_helices_count = 0\n        for helix_name in helices:\n            if helix_total_cbcs[helix_name] >= t:\n                validated_helices_count += 1\n        results.append(validated_helices_count)\n\n    # --- Final Output ---\n    # The final print statement must match the required format exactly.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2426467"}]}
