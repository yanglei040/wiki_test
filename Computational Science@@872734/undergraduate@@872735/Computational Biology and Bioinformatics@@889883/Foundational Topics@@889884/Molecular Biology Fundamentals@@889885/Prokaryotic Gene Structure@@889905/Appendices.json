This exercise challenges you to apply your knowledge of the prokaryotic gene expression pathway, from transcription to translation, to diagnose a non-functional genetic construct. By analyzing the arrangement of core components like the promoter and Ribosome Binding Site (RBS), you will reinforce your understanding of the fundamental \"grammar\" that dictates whether a gene can be successfully expressed [@problem_id:2058155].", "problem": "A synthetic biology student is designing a genetic construct to express a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in the prokaryote *Escherichia coli*. The goal is to have the bacteria produce GFP, causing them to glow under UV light. For expression in prokaryotes, a typical functional gene cassette on the DNA requires several key elements in a specific order. These elements include:\n\n-   A **Promoter**: A DNA region that recruits RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.\n-   A **Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)**: A sequence on the DNA which, when transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), serves as the binding site for the ribosome to initiate translation.\n-   A **Coding Sequence (CDS)**: The DNA sequence that encodes the amino acid sequence of the protein. It begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon.\n-   A **Terminator**: A DNA sequence that signals the end of transcription.\n\nThe student assembles the DNA construct with the following arrangement of elements (read from 5' to 3' on the coding strand):\n\nRBS -> Promoter -> CDS (for GFP) -> Terminator\n\nAfter introducing this construct into *E. coli*, the student observes that the bacterial colonies do not fluoresce, indicating a failure to produce the GFP protein. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary explanation for this result?\n\nA. The terminator sequence is positioned incorrectly, which will cause the ribosome to dissociate from the mRNA prematurely.\n\nB. The presence of the RBS sequence before the promoter will physically block RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter region.\n\nC. The mRNA transcript produced from this construct will not contain the RBS sequence, thus preventing the ribosome from binding and initiating translation.\n\nD. Transcription will fail to terminate properly, leading to an unstable, excessively long mRNA molecule that is quickly degraded.\n\nE. The start codon within the CDS will be transcribed but not translated because the promoter sequence is not included in the mRNA.", "solution": "In bacterial gene expression, the functional order of elements on the DNA must be Promoter → RBS → CDS → Terminator for proper transcription and translation. The promoter is a DNA element that recruits RNA polymerase and defines the transcription start site; crucially, promoter sequences are not transcribed into the mRNA. The ribosome binding site (e.g., Shine-Dalgarno sequence) must be located on the mRNA upstream of the start codon to recruit the ribosome and correctly position it for translation initiation. Therefore, the RBS must lie downstream of the promoter on the DNA so that it is included in the transcribed mRNA.\n\nGiven the student’s construct order, RBS → Promoter → CDS → Terminator, transcription initiated at the promoter will produce an mRNA that includes the CDS and terminator-derived sequence but excludes the upstream RBS. Consequently, the mRNA lacks an RBS, preventing the ribosome from binding and initiating translation, so no GFP is produced.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because the terminator influences transcription termination, not ribosome dissociation during translation.\n- B is incorrect because an RBS upstream of the promoter does not physically block RNA polymerase binding to the promoter.\n- C is correct because the misplacement of the RBS upstream of the promoter prevents its inclusion in the mRNA, abolishing translation initiation.\n- D is incorrect because there is no reason to expect failed transcription termination from the given arrangement.\n- E is incorrect because promoters are normally not included in mRNA and their absence from mRNA does not prevent translation; the critical missing element is the RBS on the mRNA.\n\nTherefore, the primary explanation is that the mRNA lacks the RBS, preventing translation initiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2058155"}, {"introduction": "The genetic code is read by the ribosome in a specific \"reading frame,\" grouping nucleotides into three-letter codons that specify amino acids.

The resulting protein will be identical to the intended protein, but it will be synthesized at a much lower rate.\n\nB. The resulting protein will have a single incorrect amino acid (a substitution) but will otherwise be identical to the intended protein.\n\nC. The first two amino acids of the protein will be correct, but all subsequent amino acids will be different from the intended sequence, likely producing a non-functional protein.\n\nD. The resulting protein will be shorter than the intended protein due to the immediate introduction of a premature stop codon at the site of the deletion.\n\nE. No protein will be produced because the deletion damages the start codon.", "solution": "The coding strand is given as 5'-ATG GCG TTA CCG AGT TGA-3'. For translation, the mRNA has the same sequence as the coding strand except that U replaces T, but since the provided table lists triplets using T, we can translate directly using these triplets.\n\nFirst, determine the intended translation by grouping from the start codon:\nATG | GCG | TTA | CCG | AGT | TGA\nUsing the provided table:\nATG → Met, GCG → Ala, TTA → Leu, CCG → Pro, AGT → Ser, TGA → Stop.\nThus, the intended peptide is Met-Ala-Leu-Pro-Ser followed by termination.\n\nA single base deletion occurs at the 7th base from the 5' end.

Consequently, all amino acids from the third position onward change relative to the intended sequence. There is no immediate stop codon introduced at the deletion site (the third codon becomes TAC, which codes for Tyr, not a stop), and translation would continue in the new frame until a stop codon is encountered downstream.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the first two amino acids are correct, but all subsequent amino acids are altered due to a frameshift, likely yielding a non-functional protein.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2058202"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding of gene expression is a central goal in computational biology.

This binding occurs through base pairing between the RBS and a complementary sequence on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), known as the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (anti-SD) sequence.\n\nTo quantify and predict the strength of an RBS, the student uses a simplified biophysical model that assigns a Translation Initiation Score (TIS). The model assumes that the final steady-state concentration of the expressed protein is directly proportional to its TIS.
