Provide your final answer as an exact integer with no rounding.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique and meaningful solution. It is therefore deemed valid. The solution is presented in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Definition of the Back-Translation Problem\n\nThe Central Dogma of Molecular Biology describes the flow of genetic information from Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) to Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to protein. The process of translation converts a sequence of messenger RNA (mRNA) into a peptide sequence. This conversion is governed by the genetic code, which maps codons (nucleotide triplets) to amino acids.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}$ be the set of $20$ standard amino acids and $\\mathcal{C}$ be the set of $4^3 = 64$ possible codons. The genetic code is a function $g: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{A} \\cup \\{\\text{Stop}\\}$, where $\\{\\text{Stop}\\}$ represents the set of three termination signals. This function is not injective; multiple codons can map to the same amino acid. This property is known as the degeneracy of the genetic code.\n\nFor any given amino acid $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$, we can define the set of codons that encode it as $C_a = \\{c \\in \\mathcal{C} \\mid g(c) = a\\}$. The size of this set, $D(a) = |C_a|$, is the degeneracy of amino acid $a$.\n\nThe back-translation problem is the inverse of translation. It seeks to determine the set of all possible nucleic acid sequences that could encode a given peptide sequence.\n\nFormally, given a peptide $P$ of length $n$, represented as a sequence of amino acids $P = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_n$ where each $p_i \\in \\mathcal{A}$, the back-translation problem is to find the set $S_{P}$ of all possible coding-strand DNA sequences (or their corresponding mRNA sequences) that encode $P$.\n\nUnder the assumption that codon choices for each amino acid position are independent, the total set of possible mRNA sequences is the Cartesian product of the codon sets for each amino acid in the peptide:\n$$ S_{mRNA} = C_{p_1} \\times C_{p_2} \\times \\dots \\times C_{p_n} $$\nThe total number of such unique mRNA sequences, $N_{mRNA}$, is the product of the degeneracies of the individual amino acids:\n$$ N_{mRNA} = |S_{mRNA}| = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} |C_{p_i}| = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} D(p_i) $$\nSince the transcription from the coding strand of DNA to mRNA is a one-to-one mapping (where thymine, T, is replaced by uracil, U), the number of distinct coding-strand DNA sequences, $N_{DNA}$, that encode the peptide $P$ is equal to the number of mRNA sequences. Therefore, $N_{DNA} = N_{mRNA}$. The problem is thus reduced to a combinatorial calculation based on the known degeneracies of the standard genetic code.\n\nPart 2: Computation for the Peptide $\\text{MWSRLIYNQKDGTACFPVEH}$\n\nThe specified peptide is $P = \\text{MWSRLIYNQKDGTACFPVEH}$, with a length of $n=20$ amino acids. The problem requires the calculation of the total number of distinct $5' \\to 3'$ coding-strand DNA sequences that can encode this peptide, excluding any stop codon.\n\nWe proceed by determining the degeneracy for each amino acid in the sequence, using the provided data:\n- $D(\\text{M, Met}) = 1$\n- $D(\\text{W, Trp}) = 1$\n- $D(\\text{S, Ser}) = 6$\n- $D(\\text{R, Arg}) = 6$\n- $D(\\text{L, Leu}) = 6$\n- $D(\\text{I, Ile}) = 3$\n- $D(\\text{Y, Tyr}) = 2$\n- $D(\\text{N, Asn}) = 2$\n- $D(\\text{Q, Gln}) = 2$\n- $D(\\text{K, Lys}) = 2$\n- $D(\\text{D, Asp}) = 2$\n- $D(\\text{G, Gly}) = 4$\n- $D(\\text{T, Thr}) = 4$\n- $D(\\text{A, Ala}) = 4$\n- $D(\\text{C, Cys}) = 2$\n- $D(\\text{F, Phe}) = 2$\n- $D(\\text{P, Pro}) = 4$\n- $D(\\text{V, Val}) = 4$\n- $D(\\text{E, Glu}) = 2$\n- $D(\\text{H, His}) = 2$\n\nThe total number of sequences, $N$, is the product of these degeneracy values:\n$$ N = D(\\text{M}) \\times D(\\text{W}) \\times D(\\text{S}) \\times D(\\text{R}) \\times D(\\text{L}) \\times D(\\text{I}) \\times D(\\text{Y}) \\times D(\\text{N}) \\times D(\\text{Q}) \\times D(\\text{K}) \\times D(\\text{D}) \\times D(\\text{G}) \\times D(\\text{T}) \\times D(\\text{A}) \\times D(\\text{C}) \\times D(\\text{F}) \\times D(\\text{P}) \\times D(\\text{V}) \\times D(\\text{E}) \\times D(\\text{H}) $$\nTo simplify calculation, we group the terms by their degeneracy values. We count the occurrences of each amino acid type in the peptide:\n- Degeneracy $1$: M, W ($2$ occurrences)\n- Degeneracy $2$: Y, N, Q, K, D, C, F, E, H ($9$ occurrences)\n- Degeneracy $3$: I ($1$ occurrence)\n- Degeneracy $4$: G, T, A, P, V ($5$ occurrences)\n- Degeneracy $6$: S, R, L ($3$ occurrences)\n\nThe total number of sequences is the product of these degeneracies raised to the power of their frequencies:\n$$ N = (1^2) \\times (2^9) \\times (3^1) \\times (4^5) \\times (6^3) $$\nWe can simplify this expression using prime factorization:\n$$ N = 1 \\times 2^9 \\times 3^1 \\times (2^2)^5 \\times (2 \\times 3)^3 $$\n$$ N = 2^9 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^{10} \\times 2^3 \\times 3^3 $$\nCombining the powers of the prime bases:\n$$ N = 2^{(9+10+3)} \\times 3^{(1+3)} $$\n$$ N = 2^{22} \\times 3^4 $$\nNow, we compute the final integer value:\n$2^{10} = 1024$\n$2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 = 1048576$\n$2^{22} = 2^{20} \\times 2^2 = 1048576 \\times 4 = 4194304$\n$3^4 = 81$\nFinally, we compute the product:\n$$ N = 4194304 \\times 81 = 339738624 $$\nThis is the exact number of distinct coding-strand DNA sequences that can encode the specified peptide.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{339738624}\n$$", "id": "2800939"}, {"introduction": "Why is the genetic code structured the way it is?

It is scientifically grounded in the concepts of the genetic code, codons, mutations, and degeneracy, even though it employs a simplified \"mean-field\" model. Such models are standard tools in theoretical sciences to make complex combinatorial problems tractable. The problem is objective, self-contained, and logically consistent. There are no violations of scientific principles, no ambiguities, and it is formally solvable.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected probability that a random point mutation in a codon for a specific amino acid results in a codon that does not code for the same amino acid. This is the probability of a non-synonymous mutation, averaged over the choices specified in the protocol.\n\nLet $\\Omega$ be the set of all $64$ possible codons. Let $S \\subset \\Omega$ be the set of $N$ codons that encode the amino acid in question, so $|S| = N$.\n\nThe mutation process is defined as follows: for any codon $C$, there is a set of $9$ possible single-nucleotide mutant codons, which we denote as $M(C)$. Any mutation transforms $C$ into a codon $C' \\in M(C)$ with a uniform probability of $1/9$.\n\nThe averaging protocol requires us to first select a codon, let's call it $C_0$, uniformly at random from the set $S$. Then, we must calculate the probability of a switch, which means the resulting mutant codon, $C_1$, is not in $S$. This probability is then to be averaged under the mean-field assumption.\n\nLet's fix a starting codon $C_0 \\in S$. A mutation results in a codon $C_1 \\in M(C_0)$. A switch occurs if $C_1 \\notin S$. The probability of this event, given $C_0$ and the set $S$, is:\n$$ P(\\text{switch} | C_0, S) = P(C_1 \\notin S) = \\frac{|\\{C' \\in M(C_0) \\mid C' \\notin S\\}|}{9} $$\nNote that $C_0 \\notin M(C_0)$. We can express the number of non-switching outcomes in terms of the intersection of the set of mutants $M(C_0)$ and the set of synonymous codons $S$. A non-switch (synonymous mutation) occurs if $C_1 \\in S$. The number of such outcomes is $|M(C_0) \\cap S|$. The probability of a switch is therefore:\n$$ P(\\text{switch} | C_0, S) = \\frac{9 - |M(C_0) \\cap S|}{9} = 1 - \\frac{|M(C_0) \\cap S|}{9} $$\nThe problem's mean-field assumption provides a way to average this quantity without knowing the specific arrangement of codons in $S$. The assumption states: \"conditional on the chosen codon being one of the $N$ synonymous codons [we chose $C_0$], the remaining $N-1$ synonymous codons are equally likely to be any subset of size $N-1$ drawn uniformly from the other $63$ codons.\"\n\nLet $S' = S \\setminus \\{C_0\\}$, so $|S'| = N-1$. The set $S'$ is chosen uniformly at random from all subsets of size $N-1$ of the set $\\Omega \\setminus \\{C_0\\}$, which has size $63$.\nThe set of neighbors of $C_0$ is $M(C_0)$, which is a subset of $\\Omega \\setminus \\{C_0\\}$ of size $9$.\nThe term $|M(C_0) \\cap S|$ in our probability expression is $|M(C_0) \\cap (S' \\cup \\{C_0\\})|$. Since $C_0 \\notin M(C_0)$, this simplifies to $|M(C_0) \\cap S'|$.\n\nWe must now compute the expectation of $P(\\text{switch} | C_0, S)$ over the random choice of the set $S'$. Let $P_{avg}$ be the desired expected probability.\n$$ P_{avg} = E_{S'} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{|M(C_0) \\cap S'|}{9} \\right] $$\nUsing the linearity of expectation:\n$$ P_{avg} = 1 - \\frac{E[|M(C_0) \\cap S'|]}{9} $$\nThe term $E[|M(C_0) \\cap S'|]$ is the expected number of elements in the intersection of a fixed set $M(C_0)$ of size $9$ and a randomly chosen set $S'$ of size $N-1$. The random set $S'$ is drawn from a population of size $63$.\nThis is a classic problem of sampling without replacement, and the number of \"successes\" (elements from $M(C_0)$) in our sample $S'$ follows a hypergeometric distribution. The expectation is given by the sample size multiplied by the proportion of successes in the population.\n\n- Population size: $|\\Omega \\setminus \\{C_0\\}| = 63$.\n- Number of successes in population: $|M(C_0)| = 9$.\n- Sample size: $|S'| = N-1$.\n\nThe expected number of successes is:\n$$ E[|M(C_0) \\cap S'|] = (N-1) \\times \\frac{9}{63} = \\frac{N-1}{7} $$\nThis expected value is independent of the specific choice of $C_0$. Therefore, the first step of the protocol, choosing $C_0$ uniformly from $S$, does not alter the result; the expected probability is the same for any choice of $C_0$.\n\nSubstituting this expected value back into our expression for $P_{avg}$:\n$$ P_{avg} = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{N-1}{7}}{9} = 1 - \\frac{N-1}{63} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by combining the terms:\n$$ P_{avg} = \\frac{63}{63} - \\frac{N-1}{63} = \\frac{63 - (N-1)}{63} = \\frac{63 - N + 1}{63} = \\frac{64 - N}{63} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the expected probability of a switch.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{64-N}{63}}\n$$", "id": "2384867"}, {"introduction": "Degeneracy is often viewed as redundancy, but it can also be exploited to store information with incredible density, a phenomenon observed in viral genomes with overlapping genes.

Because of the property $\\mathrm{RC}(xy)=\\mathrm{RC}(y)\\mathrm{RC}(x)$, the reverse complement of the concatenation of codons is the concatenation, in reverse order, of the reverse complements of each codon. Therefore, if we define $d_i=\\mathrm{RC}(c_i)$, the reverse-complement strand codon at position $j$ (counting from $0$ at the $5^{\\prime}$ end) is $d_{L-1-j}$. For the reverse strand to translate to $S_r$, we must have $g(d_{L-1-j})=S_r[j]$ for all $j$, equivalently $g(\\mathrm{RC}(c_i))=S_r[L-1-i]$ for all $i$.\n\nCrucially, this decomposition shows independence across positions: each forward codon $c_i$ affects only the corresponding reversed position on the reverse strand, and there are no cross-codon constraints when both strands are read in frame $0$. Hence the global constraint reduces to $L$ independent local constraints. For each $i\\in\\{0,\\dots,L-1\\}$ we must choose $c_i\\in\\Sigma^3$ satisfying the pairwise condition $g(c_i)=S_f[i]$ and $g(\\mathrm{RC}(c_i))=S_r[L-1-i]$.

Therefore, $D$ translates to $S_f$ on the forward strand and $\\mathrm{RC}(D)$ translates to $S_r$ on the reverse strand in frame $0$.\n- Completeness: If there exists any $D^{\\star}$ satisfying the constraints, then for each $i$ its codon $c_i^{\\star}$ must be in $\\mathcal{C}_i$.

Determinism follows from the lexicographic minimization per position.\n\nComplexity:\n- Preprocessing constructs $\\mathrm{Codons}(a)$ for all $a\\in\\mathcal{A}$ in $O(1)$ time with constant table size.\n- For each test case, for each position $i$ we scan at most $6$ codons for highly degenerate amino acids (e.g., Leucine, Serine, Arginine). Therefore time is $O(L)$ with a small constant, and space is $O(L)$ to store the result.\n\nOutput encoding:\n- Map nucleotides by $\\text{A}\\mapsto 0$, $\\text{C}\\mapsto 1$, $\\text{G}\\mapsto 2$, $\\text{T}\\mapsto 3$. Encode $D$ as a list of $3L$ integers in order. If no solution, output the empty list. Aggregate outputs for the $5$ required test cases into a single bracketed list with no spaces.\n\nApplication to the test suite:\n- Case $1$ with $S_f=\\text{\"MALG\"}$, $S_r=\\text{\"TQGH\"}$ is feasible; one valid deterministic $D$ is obtained by the per-position lexicographic choice.\n- Case $2$ with $S_f=\\text{\"W\"}$, $S_r=\\text{\"A\"}$ is impossible because the only Tryptophan codon $\\text{TGG}$ reverse-complements to $\\text{CCA}$ (Proline), which does not encode Alanine.\n- Case $3$ with $S_f=\\text{\"M\"}$, $S_r=\\text{\"H\"}$ is feasible because $\\text{ATG}$ reverse-complements to $\\text{CAT}$ (Histidine).\n- Case $4$ has mismatched lengths and is immediately impossible.\n- Case $5$ with $S_f=\\text{\"AKR\"}$, $S_r=\\text{\"TFS\"}$ is feasible via appropriate codon choices, uniquely determined by lexicographic minimization under the constraints.\n\nThe accompanying program implements this algorithm, includes the Standard Genetic Code, constructs the feasible codon sets, enforces the lexicographic rule, converts the result to the specified integer encoding, and prints the outputs for the five test cases as a single line with no spaces.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Mapping for nucleotide complements (Watson–Crick base pairing)\nCOMP = {'A': 'T', 'T': 'A', 'C': 'G', 'G': 'C'}\n\n# Standard Genetic Code (NCBI Translation Table 1): DNA codons to amino acids (one-letter code)\nCODON_TO_AA = {\n    # Phenylalanine, Leucine\n    'TTT': 'F', 'TTC': 'F', 'TTA': 'L', 'TTG': 'L',\n    # Serine, Proline, Threonine, Alanine\n    'TCT': 'S', 'TCC': 'S', 'TCA': 'S', 'TCG': 'S',\n    'CCT': 'P', 'CCC': 'P', 'CCA': 'P', 'CCG': 'P',\n    'ACT': 'T', 'ACC': 'T', 'ACA': 'T', 'ACG': 'T',\n    'GCT': 'A', 'GCC': 'A', 'GCA': 'A', 'GCG': 'A',\n    # Tyrosine, Histidine, Glutamine, Asparagine, Lysine, Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid, Cysteine, Tryptophan\n    'TAT': 'Y', 'TAC': 'Y', 'TAA': 'Stop', 'TAG': 'Stop',\n    'CAT': 'H', 'CAC': 'H', 'CAA': 'Q', 'CAG': 'Q',\n    'AAT': 'N', 'AAC': 'N', 'AAA': 'K', 'AAG': 'K',\n    'GAT': 'D', 'GAC': 'D', 'GAA': 'E', 'GAG': 'E',\n    'TGT': 'C', 'TGC': 'C', 'TGA': 'Stop', 'TGG': 'W',\n    # Leucine, Arginine, Isoleucine, Methionine, Valine, Serine, Arginine, Glycine\n    'CTT': 'L', 'CTC': 'L', 'CTA': 'L', 'CTG': 'L',\n    'CGT': 'R', 'CGC': 'R', 'CGA': 'R', 'CGG': 'R',\n    'ATT': 'I', 'ATC': 'I', 'ATA': 'I', 'ATG': 'M',\n    'GTT': 'V', 'GTC': 'V', 'GTA': 'V', 'GTG': 'V',\n    'AGT': 'S', 'AGC': 'S', 'AGA': 'R', 'AGG': 'R',\n    'GGT': 'G', 'GGC': 'G', 'GGA': 'G', 'GGG': 'G',\n}\n\n# Build amino acid to codons mapping (excluding Stops)\nAA_TO_CODONS = {}\nfor codon, aa in CODON_TO_AA.items():\n    if aa == 'Stop':\n        continue\n    AA_TO_CODONS.setdefault(aa, []).append(codon)\n\n# Define nucleotide order for lexicographic sorting: A < C < G < T\nNUC_ORDER = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}\n\ndef lex_key(codon: str):\n    return (NUC_ORDER[codon[0]], NUC_ORDER[codon[1]], NUC_ORDER[codon[2]])\n\n# Sort codon lists for deterministic lexicographic selection\nfor aa in AA_TO_CODONS:\n    AA_TO_CODONS[aa].sort(key=lex_key)\n\ndef reverse_complement(codon: str) -> str:\n    # Reverse the codon and complement each nucleotide\n    return ''.join(COMP[n] for n in reversed(codon))\n\ndef dna_to_ints(dna: str):\n    # Map nucleotides to integers A->0, C->1, G->2, T->3\n    mapping = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}\n    return [mapping[n] for n in dna]\n\ndef find_dual_encoding_dna(Sf: str, Sr: str):\n    # If lengths differ, impossible\n    if len(Sf) != len(Sr):\n        return []\n    L = len(Sf)\n    codons_forward = []\n\n    for i in range(L):\n        a_f = Sf[i]\n        a_r = Sr[L -
