A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of RNA velocity under two conditions based on a system of ordinary differential equations.\n\n**1. Baseline RNA Velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{normal}}$)**\n\nThe instantaneous RNA velocity is defined as $v(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt}$. Under normal physiological conditions, the rate of change of spliced RNA, $s(t)$, is given by the second differential equation:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{normal}} = \\left.\\frac{ds}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{normal}} = \\beta \\, u(t) - \\gamma \\, s(t)\n$$\nThis calculation uses the provided instantaneous counts $u$ and $s$ (at some time $t$), and the parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$. The transcription rate $\\alpha$ is not required for calculating the instantaneous velocity, as the state $(u, s)$ is given.\n\n**2. Drug-Condition RNA Velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{inhib}}$)**\n\nUnder the drug condition, a spliceosome inhibitor blocks the conversion of unspliced RNA $u(t)$ to spliced RNA $s(t)$. The problem states this removes the term \"governed by $\\beta$\". This means the term $\\beta u(t)$, which represents the rate of splicing, becomes zero in the system. The modified ODE for $s(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{ds}{dt}\\right|_{\\text{drug}} = 0 - \\gamma \\, s(t) = -\\gamma \\, s(t)\n$$\nTherefore, the instantaneous velocity in the presence of the inhibitor is:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = -\\gamma \\, s(t)\n$$\nThis calculation depends only on the degradation rate $\\gamma$ and the instantaneous count of spliced RNA $s$.\n\n**3. Change in RNA Velocity ($\\Delta v$)**\n\nThe change in velocity is defined as the difference between the inhibited and normal velocities:\n$$\n\\Delta v = v_{\\mathrm{inhib}} - v_{\\mathrm{normal}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\Delta v = (-\\gamma \\, s(t)) - (\\beta \\, u(t) - \\gamma \\, s(t))\n$$\nSimplifying the expression yields:\n$$\n\\Delta v = -\\gamma \\, s(t) - \\beta \\, u(t) + \\gamma \\, s(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta v = -\\beta \\, u(t)\n$$\nThis result is logical: the change in the rate of production of spliced RNA is precisely the rate of splicing that was inhibited by the drug.\n\n**4. Calculations for Test Cases**\n\nThe derived formulas will now be applied to each test case. All results are in molecules per hour and will be rounded to one decimal place.\n\n**Case A:** $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, u, s) = (50, 0.2, 0.05, 120, 800)$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{normal}} = (0.2)(120) - (0.05)(800) = 24.0 - 40.0 = -16.0$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = -(0.05)(800) = -40.0$\n- $\\Delta v = -40.0 - (-16.0) = -24.0$\n- Result: $[-16.0, -40.0, -24.0]$\n\n**Case B:** $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, u, s) = (10, 0.5, 0.1, 100, 0)$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{normal}} = (0.5)(100) - (0.1)(0) = 50.0 - 0.0 = 50.0$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = -(0.1)(0) = 0.0$\n- $\\Delta v = 0.0 - 50.0 = -50.0$\n- Result: $[50.0, 0.0, -50.0]$\n\n**Case C:** $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, u, s) = (10, 0.5, 0.1, 0, 1000)$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{normal}} = (0.5)(0) - (0.1)(1000) = 0.0 - 100.0 = -100.0$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = -(0.1)(1000) = -100.0$\n- $\\Delta v = -100.0 - (-100.0) = 0.0$\n- Result: $[-100.0, -100.0, 0.0]$\n\n**Case D:** $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, u, s) = (100, 1.0, 0.5, 100, 200)$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{normal}} = (1.0)(100) - (0.5)(200) = 100.0 - 100.0 = 0.0$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = -(0.5)(200) = -100.0$\n- $\\Delta v = -100.0 - 0.0 = -100.0$\n- Result: $[0.0, -100.0, -100.0]$\n\n**Case E:** $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, u, s) = (200, 0.05, 0.2, 4000, 500)$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{normal}} = (0.05)(4000) - (0.2)(500) = 200.0 - 100.0 = 100.0$\n- $v_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = -(0.2)(500) = -100.0$\n- $\\Delta v = -100.0 - 100.0 = -200.0$\n- Result: $[100.0, -100.0, -200.0]$", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes RNA velocities for a series of test cases based on a two-compartment kinetic model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (alpha, beta, gamma, u, s)\n    test_cases = [\n        (50, 0.2, 0.05, 120, 800),    # Case A\n        (10, 0.5, 0.1, 100, 0),        # Case B\n        (10, 0.5, 0.1, 0, 1000),      # Case C\n        (100, 1.0, 0.5, 100, 200),    # Case D\n        (200, 0.05, 0.2, 4000, 500),  # Case E\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        _alpha, beta, gamma, u, s = case\n\n        # 1.

This exercise challenges you to move beyond the basic linear model by incorporating the biological reality of enzyme saturation, where the splicing machinery can become a bottleneck at high levels of transcription. You will replace the linear splicing term with a more accurate Michaelis-Menten kinetics model, providing a practical lesson in adapting theoretical frameworks to better reflect complex biological systems [@problem_id:2427330].", "problem": "You are tasked with extending a standard ribonucleic acid (RNA) velocity model to account for saturation of the splicing machinery at high transcriptional activity. In the standard two-compartment description of pre-messenger RNA dynamics in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the unspliced and spliced transcript abundances are denoted by $u$ and $s$, respectively. Assume the following principles as your starting point: (i) mass balance for molecular populations, (ii) the central dogma that transcription produces unspliced RNA, splicing converts unspliced to spliced RNA, and degradation removes both species, (iii) enzyme saturation captured by Michaelis–Menten kinetics for the splicing step, and (iv) the deterministic, well-mixed limit described by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model.\n\nBegin from the following foundational statements:\n- The splicing step is catalyzed by a limited pool of spliceosome complexes acting on unspliced RNA $u$, and its net conversion flux is governed by Michaelis–Menten kinetics in the substrate $u$ with maximum rate $V_{\\max}$ and Michaelis constant $K_M$.\n- Spliced RNA $s$ is degraded with a first-order rate constant $\\gamma_s$.\n\nTask A (derivation): Using mass balance and the Michaelis–Menten description of the splicing conversion flux as a function of $u$, derive from first principles the instantaneous velocity for the spliced RNA, i.e., the time derivative $\\dfrac{ds}{dt}$, in terms of $u$, $s$, $V_{\\max}$, $K_M$, and $\\gamma_s$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and molecular biology, is well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of information for deriving and evaluating the specified model. We will now proceed with the derivation and subsequent implementation.\n\nThe task is to derive the instantaneous velocity of spliced RNA, denoted by $\\dfrac{ds}{dt}$, based on the principles of mass balance and Michaelis–Menten kinetics for an enzymatic process. The system consists of two species: unspliced RNA, $u$, and spliced RNA, $s$.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the dynamics of any chemical species in a well-mixed system is the law of mass balance. This law states that the net rate of change of the concentration of a species is equal to the sum of all influx rates (production) minus the sum of all efflux rates (consumption or degradation). For the spliced RNA species, $s$, this can be written as the following ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{dt} = \\sum (\\text{Influx to } s) - \\sum (\\text{Efflux from } s)\n$$\n\nWe must now identify the specific influx and efflux terms for $s$ from the problem description.\n\n1.  **Influx Term for Spliced RNA, $s$**:\n    The problem states that spliced RNA, $s$, is produced from the conversion of unspliced RNA, $u$. This conversion process, splicing, is catalyzed by the spliceosome machinery. The problem specifies that this process follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics, where the unspliced RNA, $u$, acts as the substrate. The rate of an enzymatic reaction described by Michaelis–Menten kinetics is given by the expression:\n    $$\n    \\text{Reaction Rate} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\text{Substrate}]}{K_M + [\\text{Substrate}]}\n    $$\n    Here, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum rate of the reaction when the enzyme is saturated with substrate, and $K_M$ (the Michaelis constant) is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of $V_{\\max}$.\n    In our context, the substrate is $u$. Therefore, the rate of splicing, which constitutes the sole influx to the population of $s$, is given by:\n    $$\n    \\text{Influx to } s = \\text{Splicing Rate} = \\frac{V_{\\max} u}{K_M + u}\n    $$\n    This term represents the rate of production of spliced RNA molecules.\n\n2.  **Efflux Term for Spliced RNA, $s$**:\n    The problem states that spliced RNA, $s$, is removed from the system via a first-order degradation process. The rate constant for this process is given as $\\gamma_s$. In a first-order process, the rate of degradation is directly proportional to the concentration of the species being degraded.\n    Thus, the efflux from the population of $s$ is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Efflux from } s = \\text{Degradation Rate} = \\gamma_s s\n    $$\n    This term represents the rate of removal of spliced RNA molecules.\n\n3.  **Complete Equation for $\\dfrac{ds}{dt}$**:\n    By substituting the derived influx and efflux terms into the mass balance equation, we obtain the complete expression for the instantaneous velocity of spliced RNA:\n    $$\n    \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max} u}{K_M + u} \\right) - (\\gamma_s s)\n    $$\n    This equation describes the net rate of change of spliced RNA abundance. The first term, $\\dfrac{V_{\\max} u}{K_M + u}$, is the production rate due to splicing, which is a saturating function of the precursor $u$. The second term, $\\gamma_s s$, is the degradation rate, which is a linear function of the species $s$ itself.

This framework is a standard tool in computational and systems biology. The premises are scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem requires a sequence of well-defined operations: a linear regression, element-wise matrix calculations, a matrix-vector product, and an averaging step, followed by a simple threshold-based decision. The linear regression problem is solvable if the design matrix is of full rank. Given the provided matrix $S^{(1)}$, its columns are linearly independent, ensuring a unique least-squares solution. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and quantitative data. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n4.  **Completeness:** All necessary data, including matrices, vectors, and constants, are provided. The problem is self-contained.\n5.  **Consistency:** The provided data and models are internally consistent. There are no contradictions in the setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a clear, self-contained, and scientifically sound computational task. A solution will be constructed as specified.\n\n**Solution Procedure**\n\nThe solution requires implementing the three steps described in the problem for each of the three test cases. Let $N$ be the number of cells ($N=6$) and $G$ be the number of genes ($G=3$).\n\n**Part 1: Linear Regression to Determine Weights**\n\nThe first step is to solve for the intercept $a$ and the weights $w_g$ from the linear model $t_i \\approx a + \\sum_{g=1}^{G} w_g s_{ig}$. This is a standard ordinary least squares (OLS) problem. We can write this in matrix form as:\n$$\nt \\approx X\\theta\n$$\nwhere $t$ is the $N \\times 1$ vector of pseudotimes, $X$ is the $N \\times (G+1)$ design matrix, and $\\theta$ is the $(G+1) \\times 1$ vector of coefficients. The design matrix $X$ is formed by prepending a column of ones to the spliced data matrix $S^{(1)}$. The coefficient vector is $\\theta = [a, w_A, w_B, w_C]^T$.\n\nThe OLS solution $\\hat{\\theta}$ minimizes the sum of squared residuals and is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T t\n$$\nSince the matrices $S^{(1)}$ and vector $t$ are common to all test cases, the coefficients $a$ and $w_g$ need to be computed only once. Numerically, it is more stable to use a pseudoinverse or a dedicated linear least squares solver rather than computing the matrix inverse directly. From the computed vector $\\hat{\\theta}$, we extract the weights $w = [w_A, w_B, w_C]^T$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of RNA Velocity**\n\nFor each test case $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the RNA velocity matrix $V^{(k)}$ of size $N \\times G$ is computed. The elements $v_{ig}^{(k)}$ are given by the formula:\n$$\nv_{ig}^{(k)} = \\beta_g u_{ig}^{(k)} - \\gamma_g s_{ig}\n$$\nIn matrix notation, this is performed by element-wise operations. Let $U^{(k)}$ be the unspliced matrix for test case $k$, and $S = S^{(1)}$ be the spliced matrix. Let $B$ and $\\Gamma$ be $N \\times G$ matrices formed by broadcasting the gene-specific rate vectors $\\beta = [\\beta_A, \\beta_B, \\beta_C]$ and $\\gamma = [\\gamma_A, \\gamma_B, \\gamma_C]$ across the $N$ rows. Then, the velocity matrix is:\n$$\nV^{(k)} = U^{(k)} \\odot B - S \\odot \\Gamma\n$$\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes the Hadamard (element-wise) product. This calculation is performed for each of the three unspliced matrices $U^{(1)}$, $U^{(2)}$, and $U^{(3)}$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Net Differentiation Flow and Decision**\n\nFor each test case $k$, we compute the vector of per-cell predicted time rates, $r^{(k)}$, of size $N \\times 1$. Each element $r_i^{(k)}$ is the dot product of the $i$-th cell's velocity vector (the $i$-th row of $V^{(k)}$) and the weight vector $w$:\n$$\nr_i^{(k)} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} w_g v_{ig}^{(k)}\n$$\nIn matrix form, this is a product of the velocity matrix and the weight vector:\n$$\nr^{(k)} = V^{(k)} w\n$$\nThe dataset-average rate $\\bar{r}^{(k)}$ is then the mean of the elements of $r^{(k)}$:\n$$\n\\bar{r}^{(k)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i^{(k)}\n$$\nFinally, the decision rule is applied with the tolerance $\\varepsilon = 0.05$. For each test case $k$:\n- If $\\bar{r}^{(k)}  0.05$, the result is $1$.\n- If $\\bar{r}^{(k)}  -0.05$, the result is $-1$.\n- If $-0.05 \\le \\bar{r}^{(k)} \\le 0.05$, the result is $0$.\n\nThe final output is a list containing the integer results for the three test cases in order.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the RNA velocity inference procedure for three test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 0: Define constants and shared data ---\n\n    # Tolerance for decision rule\n    epsilon = 0.05\n\n    # Rate constants for genes {A, B, C}\n    beta = np.array([1.0, 0.9, 1.1])\n    gamma = np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.4])\n\n    # Pseudotime vector (shared across all cases)\n    t = np.array([0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80])\n\n    # Spliced data matrix (shared across all cases)\n    S_matrix = np.array([\n        [2.0, 1.0, 3.0],\n        [2.5, 1.2, 3.5],\n        [3.0, 1.5, 4.0],\n        [5.5, 3.5, 6.0],\n        [6.5, 4.2, 7.2],\n        [7.0, 5.0, 8.0]\n    ])\n\n    # Define the unspliced matrices for the three test cases\n    test_cases_U = [\n        # Test case 1\n        np.array([\n            [6.0, 4.5, 5.5],\n            [5.8, 4.0, 5.0],\n            [5.5, 3.8, 4.6],\n            [3.5, 2.7, 3.2],\n            [2.5, 2.2, 2.5],\n            [2.0, 1.8, 2.1]\n        ]),\n        # Test case 2\n        np.array([\n            [0.6, 0.5555556, 1.0909091],\n            [0.75, 0.6666667, 1.2727273],\n            [0.9, 0.8333333, 1.4545455],\n            [1.65, 1.9444444, 2.1818182],\n            [1.95, 2.3333334, 2.6181818],\n            [2.1, 2.7777778, 2.9090909]\n        ]),\n        # Test case 3\n        np.array([\n            [0.6, 0.45, 0.55],\n            [0.58, 0.40, 0.50],\n            [0.55, 0.38, 0.46],\n            [0.35, 0.27, 0.32],\n            [0.25, 0.22, 0.25],\n            [0.20, 0.18, 0.21]\n        ])\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    # --- Step 1: Linear Regression to find weights (common for all cases) ---\n    \n    # Create the design matrix X by adding a column of ones for the intercept\n    # X has shape (num_cells, num_genes + 1)\n    num_cells = S_matrix.shape[0]\n    X_design = np.hstack([np.ones((num_cells, 1)), S_matrix])\n\n    # Solve the linear least squares problem t ~ X * theta\n    # theta = [intercept, w_A, w_B, w_C]\n    theta, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(X_design, t, rcond=None)\n    \n    # Extract the weights w_g for the genes\n    weights = theta[1:]\n\n    # --- Loop through each test case ---\n    for U_matrix in test_cases_U:\n        \n        # --- Step 2: Compute the RNA velocity matrix V ---\n        # v_ig = beta_g * u_ig - gamma_g * s_ig\n        # This is V = U * B - S * G in an element-wise fashion\n        # numpy's broadcasting handles this automatically:\n        # U_matrix (6,3) * beta (3,) - element-wise product along rows\n        velocity_matrix = U_matrix * beta - S_matrix * gamma\n\n        # --- Step 3: Compute predicted time rates and the average ---\n        # r_i = sum_g(w_g * v_ig)\n        # In matrix form: r = V * w\n        # r is a (num_cells, 1) vector\n        r_per_cell = np.dot(velocity_matrix, weights)\n\n        # Compute the dataset-average rate r_bar\n        r_bar = np.mean(r_per_cell)\n\n        # --- Step 4: Apply the decision rule ---\n        if r_bar  epsilon:\n            decision = 1\n        elif r_bar  -epsilon:\n            decision = -1\n        else:\n            decision = 0\n        \n        results.append(decision)\n\n    # --- Final Output Formatting ---\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2941032"}]}
