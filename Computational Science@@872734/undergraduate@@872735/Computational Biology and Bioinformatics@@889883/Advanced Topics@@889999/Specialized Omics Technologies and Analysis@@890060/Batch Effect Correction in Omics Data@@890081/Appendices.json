The use of a linear model to represent additive batch effects and a biological signal, and then using another linear model (multiple regression) to correct for these effects, is a fundamental and widely accepted method (e.g., as implemented in the ComBat algorithm or as a direct regression). The premise is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) solution to a multiple linear regression problem. A unique solution exists if and only if the design matrix has full column rank. The design matrix consists of an intercept, the biological predictor vector $x$, and $B-1$ dummy variables for the batches. For the matrix to be rank-deficient, one column must be a linear combination of the others. This would happen if the biological variable $x$ is perfectly confounded with batch membership (e.g., all samples in one batch have $x=1$ and all samples in another have $x=0$). A review of the provided test cases confirms that for each case, every batch contains samples with both $x_i=1$ and $x_i=0$. This ensures that there is no perfect multicollinearity between the biological predictor and the batch indicators. Therefore, the design matrix will have full column rank for all test cases, guaranteeing a unique solution. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is specified using precise mathematical notation and unambiguous algorithmic instructions for data generation and analysis. It is free from subjective claims.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete, consistent set of specifications. Proceeding with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the estimation of a parameter in a multiple linear regression model. The model can be expressed in matrix form as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\theta} + \\boldsymbol{\\eta}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{y}$ is the $n \\times 1$ vector of observed values, $\\mathbf{X}$ is the $n \\times (2+B-1)$ design matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is the $(2+B-1) \\times 1$ vector of parameters to be estimated, and $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$ is the $n \\times 1$ vector of residual errors. The parameter vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\delta_2, \\dots, \\delta_B]^T$.\n\nThe objective is to find the parameter vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (SSR), given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SSR}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\eta_i^2 = \\boldsymbol{\\eta}^T\\boldsymbol{\\eta} = (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\theta})^T (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n$$\nThe solution to this minimization problem is the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator, which is found by solving the normal equations:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}) \\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n$$\nAssuming the matrix $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ is invertible (which we have established it is for the given test cases), the unique solution is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n$$\nFor each test case, the procedure is as follows:\n1.  Construct the total sample size $n = \\sum_{b=1}^{B} n_b$.\n2.  Construct the $n \\times 1$ biological condition vector $\\mathbf{x}$ by concatenating blocks of $k_b$ ones and $(n_b - k_b)$ zeros for $b=1, \\dots, B$.\n3.  Construct the $n \\times 1$ batch assignment vector, where each entry identifies the batch for the corresponding sample.\n4.  Construct the $n \\times 1$ true batch effect vector $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$ using the provided $\\gamma_b$ values and the batch assignment vector.\n5.  Initialize a pseudo-random number generator with the given seed. Generate the $n \\times 1$ noise vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ by drawing from $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n6.  Generate the $n \\times 1$ measurement vector $\\mathbf{y}$ according to the generative model: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mu\\mathbf{1} + \\beta\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\gamma} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones.\n7.  Construct the $n \\times (B+1)$ design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$.\n    - The first column is an intercept, an $n \\times 1$ vector of ones.\n    - The second column is the biological condition vector $\\mathbf{x}$.\n    - The subsequent $B-1$ columns are indicator (dummy) variables for batches $2, \\dots, B$. The $j$-th dummy variable column (for $j \\in \\{2, \\dots, B\\}$) has a $1$ for samples in batch $j$ and $0$ otherwise.\n8.  Solve the OLS problem for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$. Computationally, this is best done using a stable numerical method like QR decomposition, which is implemented in libraries such as NumPy via the `linalg.lstsq` function.\n9.  The desired result is the second element of the resulting vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$, which corresponds to the estimate $\\hat{\\theta}_1$ of the biological coefficient $\\beta$.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic and will be applied to each test case to compute the required values.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the OLS problem for batch effect correction across multiple test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test 1\n        {\n            \"B\": 2, \"n\": (50, 50), \"k\": (25, 25),\n            \"mu\": 7.0, \"beta\": 0.2, \"gamma\": (0.0, 2.0), \"sigma\": 0.4,\n            \"seed\": 123\n        },\n        # Test 2\n        {\n            \"B\": 2, \"n\": (40, 60), \"k\": (8, 42),\n            \"mu\": 5.0, \"beta\": 0.2, \"gamma\": (0.0, 2.0), \"sigma\": 0.5,\n            \"seed\": 456\n        },\n        # Test 3\n        {\n            \"B\": 3, \"n\": (30, 50, 40), \"k\": (10, 25, 15),\n            \"mu\": 10.0, \"beta\": 0.15, \"gamma\": (0.0, 1.5, -0.5), \"sigma\": 0.6,\n            \"seed\": 789\n        },\n        # Test 4\n        {\n            \"B\": 4, \"n\": (5, 5, 5, 5), \"k\": (2, 3, 2, 3),\n            \"mu\": 3.0, \"beta\": 0.1, \"gamma\": (0.0, 1.0, -1.0, 0.5), \"sigma\": 0.2,\n            \"seed\": 2468\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Extract parameters for the current test case\n        B = case[\"B\"]\n        n_b = case[\"n\"]\n        k_b = case[\"k\"]\n        mu = case[\"mu\"]\n        beta = case[\"beta\"]\n        gamma_params = case[\"gamma\"]\n        sigma = case[\"sigma\"]\n        seed = case[\"seed\"]\n\n        n_total = sum(n_b)\n\n        # 1.

The true effects $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_j$ do not influence the error metric $E$ at all.\n\nFor test cases $1$, $3$, and $4$, the noise matrix $\\epsilon_{ij}$ contains only entries equal to $1.0$.

Consequently, the summary error $E$ is exactly $0$ for these cases.\n\nFor test cases $2$ and $5$, the noise is non-trivial. The error $E$ must be calculated by first computing the matrix of $E_{ij} = \\log\\epsilon_{ij}$, then its row means, column means, and grand mean, and finally the maximum absolute deviation as per the formula for $E$.

Our objective is to estimate the column space of $H$, remove its influence from $X$, while preserving the influence of the column space of $C$.\n\n**Step 1: Estimation of the Latent Batch Subspace**\n\nThe first step is to construct an estimator $\\widehat{H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k_{\\text{est}}}$ for the latent subspace. The strategy is to first remove the linear effects of the known covariates $C$ and then identify the principal directions of variation in the remaining data.\n\nThe residual matrix after removing the projection onto the column space of $C$ is $R = X M_C$, where $M_C = I_n - P_C$ and $P_C = C C^+$ is the orthogonal projection matrix onto the column space of $C$. Here, $C^+$ denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $C$, which correctly handles cases where $C$ is not of full column rank or has zero columns (i.e., $q=0$).\n\nThe estimator $\\widehat{H}$ is defined as the matrix with $k_{\\text{est}}$ orthonormal columns that maximizes the captured variance in $R$:\n$$ \\widehat{H} \\;=\\; \\arg\\max_{H' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k_{\\text{est}}},\\, (H')^\\top H' = I_{k_{\\text{est}}}} \\; \\lVert R P_{H'} \\rVert_F^2 $$\nSince the columns of $H'$ are orthonormal, its pseudoinverse is its transpose, so $P_{H'} = H' (H')^+ = H' (H')^\\top$. The objective function can be rewritten using the property $\\lVert A \\rVert_F^2 = \\text{tr}(A^\\top A)$:\n$$ \\lVert R H' (H')^\\top \\rVert_F^2 \\;=\\; \\text{tr}\\left(\\left(R H' (H')^\\top\\right)^\\top \\left(R H' (H')^\\top\\right)\\right) \\;=\\; \\text{tr}\\left(H' (H')^\\top R^\\top R H' (H')^\\top\\right) $$\nUsing the cyclic property of the trace and the constraint $(H')^\\top H' = I_{k_{\\text{est}}}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\text{tr}\\left((H')^\\top R^\\top R H'\\right) $$\nThis is a classical trace maximization problem from linear algebra. The solution is that the columns of the optimal matrix, $\\widehat{H}$, must be the orthonormal eigenvectors corresponding to the $k_{\\text{est}}$ largest eigenvalues of the symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix $S_R = R^\\top R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. This procedure is equivalent to performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the sample dimension of the residual data.\n\nThe computational procedure is thus:\n$1$. Compute $P_C = C C^+$ via an SVD-based pseudoinverse. If $q=0$, $C$ is an $n \\times 0$ matrix, and $P_C$ correctly evaluates to the $n \\times n$ zero matrix.\n$2$.

Construct $\\widehat{H}$ from the $k_{\\text{est}}$ eigenvectors corresponding to the largest $k_{\\text{est}}$ eigenvalues. If $k_{\\text{est}}=0$, $\\widehat{H}$ is an empty $n \\times 0$ matrix.\n\n**Step 2: Construction of the Corrected Data Matrix**\n\nThe corrected data matrix, $X_{\\text{corr}}$, is formed to retain the signal associated with $C$ while removing the estimated batch effects. The formula is:\n$$ X_{\\text{corr}} \\;=\\; X P_C \\;+\\; X M_Q $$\nwhere $Q = [\\, C \\;\\; \\widehat{H} \\,]$ is the concatenation of the covariate and estimated batch factor matrices, and $M_Q = I_n - P_Q$ is the residual-forming matrix for the combined subspace.\n\nThis formula has a clear interpretation. The term $X P_C$ is the projection of the original data onto the covariate subspace, representing the part of the data we wish to preserve. The term $X M_Q$ is the projection of the original data onto the subspace orthogonal to the combined space of covariates and estimated batch effects.\n\nTo verify that the signal attributable to $C$ is preserved, we project $X_{\\text{corr}}$ back onto the covariate subspace:\n$$ X_{\\text{corr}} P_C = (X P_C + X M_Q) P_C = X P_C P_C + X M_Q P_C $$\nSince $P_C$ is an idempotent projection matrix, $P_C P_C = P_C$. The column space of $C$ is a subspace of the column space of $Q$, so any vector in the column space of $C$ is an eigenvector of $P_Q$ with eigenvalue $1$. This implies that the projection $P_Q$ acts as the identity on the column space of $C$, so $P_Q P_C = P_C$. Therefore, the product $M_Q P_C = (I_n - P_Q) P_C = P_C - P_Q P_C = P_C - P_C$ is the zero matrix.\nIt follows that $X_{\\text{corr}} P_C = X P_C$. The projection of the corrected data onto the covariate subspace is identical to that of the original data, confirming that the signal of interest is preserved by the transformation.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation of Batch Effect Removal**\n\nThe effectiveness of the correction is quantified by the fraction of batch-associated variance remaining in the corrected data:\n$$ f \\;=\\; \\frac{\\lVert X_{\\text{corr}} \\, P_{H_{\\text{true}}} \\rVert_F^2}{\\lVert X_{\\text{corr}} \\rVert_F^2} $$\nHere, $H_{\\text{true}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k_{\\text{true}}}$ is the ground-truth batch design matrix. The numerator measures the energy (squared Frobenius norm) of the corrected data projected onto the true batch subspace. The denominator is the total energy of the corrected data. A value of $f$ close to $0$ indicates successful removal of batch effects. If $k_{\\text{true}}=0$, there are no batch effects to begin with; in this case $P_{H_{\\text{true}}}$ is the zero matrix, which correctly yields $f=0$. The computation requires calculating the projection matrix $P_{H_{\\text{true}}}$ and then the squared Frobenius norms. If the denominator is zero, which implies $X_{\\text{corr}}$ is a zero matrix, the fraction is taken to be $0$, as the numerator must also be zero.\n\nThe implementation will follow these steps, using a deterministic pseudorandom number generator as specified to synthesize the test data for each case.
