This exercise challenges you to think beyond simple sequence identity and consider the template's biological context. By analyzing a scenario where the template is bound to DNA but the target is not, you will learn to anticipate and identify potential modeling artifacts that can arise from differences in functional states [@problem_id:2434219].", "problem": "You are building a comparative model of a monomeric protein domain from a homolog whose highest-identity structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a complex with Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). Your target protein is known to exist in an unbound (apo) state under physiological buffer conditions and does not interact with nucleic acids. You plan to use the homologous protein coordinates as a template after removing the DNA coordinates. Consider the following statements about how the presence of DNA in the template structure can bias the template-based model of the apo target.\n\nUse the following foundational bases: (i) a folded protein in a given environment tends to occupy conformational states near local minima of the Gibbs free energy, with population weighting given by the Boltzmann distribution, i.e., states with lower $\\Delta G$ are more populated at absolute temperature $T$; (ii) binding partners contribute enthalpic stabilization (e.g., electrostatics, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals) and entropic penalties (e.g., conformational restriction), so removing a binding partner can alter which conformational substate is favored; (iii) template-based modeling propagates the backbone geometry and side-chain rotamers of the template as an initial guess, thus inheriting context-specific features present in the template.\n\nWhich of the following artifacts are likely and should be explicitly considered or corrected when adapting the DNA-bound template for modeling the apo target? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Positively charged side chains at the nucleic-acid interface (e.g., lysines and arginines) are modeled in extended rotamers oriented toward where the phosphate backbone would be, potentially leaving unsatisfied charges and spurious surface protrusions once DNA is removed.\n\nB. Helices and loops that act as a clamp around DNA are captured in a closed conformation stabilized by protein–DNA contacts, which can bias the apo model toward an over-closed state relative to its unbound ensemble.\n\nC. Backbone dihedral angles throughout the protein are intrinsically unbiased by ligands, so a ligand-bound template generally provides a more accurate apo backbone than any apo template of similar homology.\n\nD. Loops adjacent to the DNA that are ordered by protein–DNA contacts in the template may in fact be flexible in the apo protein; transferring those ordered coordinates can overconstrain these regions and misrepresent their dynamics.\n\nE. The oligomeric state inferred from the template may reflect DNA-mediated dimerization or higher-order assembly, leading to an incorrect multimeric model if naively transferred to the apo target.\n\nChoose the option(s) that best align with the stated principles.", "solution": "We are asked to reason from first principles about how the environment, specifically the presence of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), can bias a protein structure and thereby bias a comparative model. The fundamental bases are: (i) the Gibbs free energy $G$ determines the favored conformational states; the populations of states are weighted by the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-\\Delta G/RT)$ at absolute temperature $T$ where $R$ is the gas constant; (ii) a binding partner contributes favorable enthalpic interactions (electrostatics, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals) while imposing entropic costs, shifting the free-energy landscape; (iii) comparative modeling transfers backbone and side-chain features from the template, causing any ligand-induced features in the template to propagate into the model.\n\nFrom these, consider how DNA affects the protein:\n\n- Electrostatics: DNA is highly negatively charged due to its phosphate backbone. Proteins that bind DNA often present positively charged residues (lysine, arginine) oriented toward the DNA to form salt bridges or hydrogen bonds. In the complex, those side chains adopt rotamers that satisfy interactions with DNA, lowering $\\Delta G$ in that context. Removing DNA eliminates those favorable contacts; the same rotamers may become energetically unfavorable (unsatisfied charges, desolvation penalties). Thus, a model initialized from the DNA-bound template will likely inherit interface side-chain orientations inappropriate for the apo state.\n\n- Conformational selection and induced fit: Binding can stabilize a closed or clamped conformation of helices and loops around DNA, again reducing $\\Delta G$ in the bound state. Without DNA, the closed conformation may no longer be the lowest $\\Delta G$ substate; an open or alternative conformation might be favored. A template captured in the closed state will bias the apo model toward that state.\n\n- Ordering of flexible regions: Loops near the binding interface may be disordered or sample multiple conformations in solution (high conformational entropy). Binding can order these loops via specific contacts, paying entropic costs offset by enthalpic gains. The template may therefore show well-ordered loop coordinates that do not reflect the apo ensemble; directly transferring those coordinates imposes an artificial rigidity in the model.\n\n- Quaternary structure: Some proteins oligomerize upon DNA binding, either by direct protein–protein contacts stabilized by the DNA or because DNA brings monomers into proximity (DNA-mediated assembly). The template may thus be multimeric even if the apo protein is monomeric. Naively transferring oligomeric state or interface geometry can misrepresent the apo assembly.\n\n- Global backbone independence: The notion that ligand binding does not bias backbone dihedrals is incorrect. Ligand binding can alter secondary structure orientation, helix bending, loop closure, and domain orientations by stabilizing specific conformational substates.\n\nNow analyze each option:\n\nA. This describes positively charged residues at the DNA interface adopting rotamers pointing toward the phosphate backbone. In the bound state, these rotamers are stabilized by favorable electrostatics and hydrogen bonding, lowering $\\Delta G$. Removing DNA removes those favorable interactions while preserving desolvation penalties and possibly introducing unsatisfied charges. A comparative model initialized from such a template will inherit these rotamers, potentially creating unrealistic exposed cationic side chains until refinement reoptimizes them. This is a plausible and common artifact. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This states that clamp-like helices/loops are captured in a closed conformation stabilized by the DNA, biasing the apo model toward an over-closed state. From the free-energy perspective, DNA binding stabilizes closed conformations via enthalpic contacts, shifting the conformational ensemble. Without DNA, the closed state may be less populated. A template frozen in the closed conformation will bias the model accordingly. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. This claims that backbone dihedrals are intrinsically unbiased by ligands, thus a ligand-bound template provides a more accurate apo backbone. This contradicts the principle that binding can shift the conformational landscape by stabilizing specific backbone arrangements (helix bending, loop positions, domain closures). Therefore, ligand-bound templates can be systematically biased relative to the apo state. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This asserts that loops ordered by protein–DNA contacts in the template may actually be flexible in the apo protein and that transferring coordinates can overconstrain them. Binding often orders flexible loops by providing specific contacts, lowering $\\Delta H$ and offsetting an entropic loss, thereby reducing $\\Delta G$. Without DNA, those loops may regain flexibility. Transferring a single ordered conformation misrepresents the apo ensemble and can produce an overly rigid model. Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. This addresses oligomeric state: DNA may mediate dimerization or higher-order assemblies, leading to incorrect quaternary modeling if blindly transferred. DNA can act as a scaffold, increasing effective concentration and stabilizing protein–protein interfaces that may not exist in the apo state. Therefore, an oligomeric template can mislead the apo model. Verdict: Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct choices are A, B, D, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2434219"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in modeling is predicting how sequence differences between the target and template will manifest structurally. This practice focuses on a crucial long-range interaction: the disulfide bond. You will explore the consequences of modeling a protein that lacks a disulfide bond present in the template, sharpening your understanding of protein stability, flexibility, and packing [@problem_id:2434235].", "problem": "You are performing template-based model building (homology modeling) of a single-chain protein. The chosen template has an intramolecular disulfide bond between residues Cys50 and Cys95, and the sequence alignment places your target residues Ala50 and Ala95 at the same positions. Assume the alignment is correct, the remaining aligned regions are identical in sequence, and the initial model is built by transferring backbone coordinates for aligned regions and rebuilding side chains to match the target. During refinement, you use a standard physically motivated energy function without imposing any covalent disulfide constraints. Which statements best describe the expected structural consequences in the final refined model? Select all that apply.\n\nA. The model will maintain a covalent link between positions $50$ and $95$ because the backbone connectivity demands it, so the local geometry at those positions should remain essentially unchanged from the template.\n\nB. With no disulfide possible at positions $50$ and $95$, the final model should lack any covalent restraint between those sites; the two segments will likely exhibit increased flexibility and potentially larger separation or alternative packing relative to the template, while the overall fold can remain similar if supported by other noncovalent contacts.\n\nC. The model will compensate by creating a salt bridge between Ala50 and Ala95 that preserves the geometry of the template’s disulfide, thereby maintaining the same inter-segment constraint.\n\nD. Replacing cysteines by alanines eliminates the possibility of a disulfide and reduces side-chain volume at both positions; local packing may loosen (potentially creating a small cavity) and be resolved by modest rearrangements during refinement, and the folded state is expected to be less thermally stable near that long-range contact relative to the disulfide-bonded template.\n\nE. Removing the disulfide requires breaking the polypeptide backbone near positions $50$ and $95$; therefore, the chain becomes discontinuous between residues around those positions in the final model.", "solution": "The problem describes a standard homology modeling workflow where a target protein is modeled based on a template structure. The key difference between the template and the target is the substitution of two Cysteine (Cys) residues, Cys50 and Cys95, which form a covalent disulfide bond, with two Alanine (Ala) residues, Ala50 and Ala95.\n\nA disulfide bond is a covalent bond between the sulfur atoms of two cysteine side chains. This bond acts as a strong \"staple,\" holding two parts of the polypeptide chain, which may be distant in sequence, in close spatial proximity. In the template, this bond rigidly constrains the backbone segments around residues $50$ and $95$.\n\nThe target protein has Alanine at these positions. The side chain of Alanine is a methyl group ($-CH_3$), which is chemically inert, nonpolar, and incapable of forming covalent bonds with other side chains.\n\nThe initial model is constructed by copying the template's backbone. Thus, initially, the backbones at positions $50$ and $95$ in the target model are placed in the same conformation as in the template, meaning they are close together.\n\nThe refinement step uses a \"standard physically motivated energy function\". Such functions (e.g., from force fields like AMBER or CHARMM) calculate the potential energy of the system based on its atomic coordinates. The energy includes terms for bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles, and non-bonded interactions (van der Waals and electrostatic forces). Crucially, the problem states that **no covalent disulfide constraints are imposed**. This is logical, as the model contains Alanine, not Cysteine, at these positions.\n\nDuring refinement (energy minimization or molecular dynamics), the structure evolves to find a lower energy conformation. Without the strong covalent `S-S` bond energy term that existed in the template, there is no force holding the side chains of Ala50 and Ala95 together. The only interactions between these two residues and their surrounding segments will be weak, non-bonded van der Waals and electrostatic forces.\n\nThe consequences are as follows:\n$1$. **Loss of Covalent Restraint**: The primary consequence is the removal of the strong covalent cross-link. The two chain segments in the vicinity of residues $50$ and $95$ are no longer chemically tethered.\n$2$. **Increased Flexibility**: This loss of restraint grants the local polypeptide segments significantly more conformational freedom. They are free to move relative to each other, driven by thermal motion and the search for optimal non-covalent packing. This may lead to a larger average separation between these regions compared to the template.\n$3$. **Changes in Local Packing**: The side chain of Cysteine ($-CH_2SH$) is larger than that of Alanine ($-CH_3$). Replacing two Cys residues participating in a disulfide bond with two Ala residues results in a significant reduction in local side-chain volume. This can create a small void or cavity in the protein core. The refinement process will likely cause the surrounding structure to rearrange modestly to collapse this void and optimize van der Waals packing.\n$4$. **Decreased Stability**: Disulfide bonds are major contributors to the thermodynamic stability of a protein's folded state. They decrease the conformational entropy of the unfolded state, thereby stabilizing the folded conformation. Removing a disulfide bond is known to significantly decrease the protein's thermal stability (i.e., lower its melting temperature).\n$5$. **Preservation of Overall Fold (Conditional)**: While the region around the former disulfide bond will change, the global fold of the protein is likely to remain similar to the template, provided it is stabilized by a sufficient network of other non-covalent interactions (e.g., a large hydrophobic core, extensive hydrogen bonding). This is a fundamental assumption of homology modeling.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The model will maintain a covalent link between positions $50$ and $95$ because the backbone connectivity demands it, so the local geometry at those positions should remain essentially unchanged from the template.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. A covalent link between residues $50$ and $95$ is a side-chain interaction (disulfide bond), not a feature of the polypeptide backbone. The backbone runs sequentially from residue $49$ to $50$ to $51$, etc., and separately from $94$ to $95$ to $96$, etc. Alanine residues cannot form a covalent bond with each other. The premise is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. With no disulfide possible at positions $50$ and $95$, the final model should lack any covalent restraint between those sites; the two segments will likely exhibit increased flexibility and potentially larger separation or alternative packing relative to the template, while the overall fold can remain similar if supported by other noncovalent contacts.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of the primary consequences. It correctly identifies that there is no covalent restraint. It correctly predicts increased flexibility and potential separation of the segments. It also correctly notes that the overall fold can be preserved if other interactions are sufficient to maintain it. This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The model will compensate by creating a salt bridge between Ala50 and Ala95 that preserves the geometry of the template’s disulfide, thereby maintaining the same inter-segment constraint.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A salt bridge is an electrostatic interaction between an acidic (negatively charged) and a basic (positively charged) amino acid side chain, such as aspartate and lysine. Alanine is a small, nonpolar amino acid with an uncharged side chain. It cannot participate in a salt bridge.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Replacing cysteines by alanines eliminates the possibility of a disulfide and reduces side-chain volume at both positions; local packing may loosen (potentially creating a small cavity) and be resolved by modest rearrangements during refinement, and the folded state is expected to be less thermally stable near that long-range contact relative to the disulfide-bonded template.**\nThis statement accurately describes the consequences from a packing and stability perspective. It correctly states that the disulfide is eliminated. It correctly identifies the reduction in side-chain volume, the resulting loosening of local packing, and the potential for a cavity that would be addressed during refinement. Lastly, it correctly concludes that the removal of a stabilizing disulfide bond will lead to a decrease in the thermal stability of the folded protein. All points are valid and complementary to option B.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Removing the disulfide requires breaking the polypeptide backbone near positions $50$ and $95$; therefore, the chain becomes discontinuous between residues around those positions in the final model.**\nThis statement is based on a gross misunderstanding of protein structure. A disulfide bond connects side chains, not the polypeptide backbone. The backbone is a continuous covalent chain. The modeling and refinement process is designed to preserve the integrity of the backbone. Breaking the backbone is not an expected outcome; it would be a critical failure of the simulation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, options B and D both provide accurate and complementary descriptions of the expected consequences of the Cys-to-Ala substitutions in the homology model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2434235"}, {"introduction": "Evaluating the accuracy of a finished model is a critical step in the modeling pipeline.
