The task described is known as \"link prediction.\" The assumption that PPI networks are scale-free is a mainstream hypothesis in the field. The use of a degree-based score like $S(u,v) = k_u \\cdot k_v$ directly reflects the principle of preferential attachment, a core mechanism for the growth of scale-free networks. This scoring function is a well-established heuristic (known as the Degree Product or Preferential Attachment index).\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is specified with mathematical precision. All inputs are defined, the scoring function is explicit, and the tie-breaking rule is unambiguous. This ensures that for each test case, a single, deterministic integer result exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem statement is free of subjective or ambiguous language. It is a formal, algorithmic challenge.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary data ($N$, $E_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{true}}$, $L$) are provided for each test case. There are no contradictions in the problem specification.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Principle-Based Solution**\n\nThe problem addresses link prediction in an incomplete network under the assumption that the true, complete network is scale-free. Scale-free networks are characterized by a degree distribution $P(k)$ that follows a power law, approximately $P(k) \\sim k^{-\\gamma}$, where $k$ is the degree and $\\gamma$ is a constant. A key feature of such networks is the presence of a few highly connected nodes, or \"hubs.\" The preferential attachment model, which generates scale-free networks, posits that the probability of a new node connecting to an existing node $i$ is proportional to the degree $k_i$ of that node.\n\nThis principle is directly translated into a link prediction heuristic. For two currently unconnected nodes $u$ and $v$, the likelihood of a future or unobserved link between them is assumed to be proportional to the product of their current degrees, $k_u \\cdot k_v$. Nodes with higher degrees are more \"attractive\" and are thus more likely to form links. The problem formalizes this heuristic with the score $S(u,v) = k_u \\cdot k_v$ calculated from the observed, incomplete network $G_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (V, E_{\\mathrm{obs}})$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Compute Node Degrees**: For each node $u$ in the set of all nodes $V = \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, calculate its degree $k_u$ based on the observed edge set $E_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The degree $k_u$ is the number of edges in $E_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ incident to $u$.\n\n2.  **Identify and Score Candidate Pairs**: Enumerate all possible unordered pairs of distinct nodes $\\{u,v\\}$ where $uv$. From this set of all possible edges, remove those that are already present in $E_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The remaining pairs are the candidate edges for prediction. For each such candidate pair $\\{u,v\\}$, compute the link-likelihood score $S(u,v) = k_u \\cdot k_v$.\n\n3.  **Rank Candidate Pairs**: Create a ranked list of all candidate pairs. The primary sorting criterion is the score $S(u,v)$ in descending order. The secondary criterion, used to break ties, is the lexicographical order of the pair $(u,v)$ in ascending order (assuming $uv$ is maintained).\n\n4.  **Select Predictions and Evaluate**: From the top of the ranked list, select the first $L$ pairs. These are the predicted missing edges. The performance of the prediction is evaluated by counting how many of these $L$ predicted pairs are members of the ground-truth set of missing edges, $E_{\\mathrm{miss}} = E_{\\mathrm{true}} \\setminus E_{\\mathrm{obs}}$.\n\n**Illustrative Example: Test Case A**\n\nLet us apply this procedure to Test Case A.\n- **Givens**: $N = 6$, $E_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\{(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(4,5)\\}$, $E_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\{(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,2),(2,3),(4,5)\\}$, $L = 2$.\n\n1.  **Compute Degrees**: Based on $E_{\\mathrm{obs}}$:\n    - $k_0 = 3$ (connected to $1,2,3$)\n    - $k_1 = 2$ (connected to $0,2$)\n    - $k_2 = 2$ (connected to $0,1$)\n    - $k_3 = 1$ (connected to $0$)\n    - $k_4 = 1$ (connected to $5$)\n    - $k_5 = 1$ (connected to $4$)\n\n2.  **Identify and Score Candidate Pairs**: The total number of pairs is $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$. There are $|E_{\\mathrm{obs}}| = 5$ observed edges. Thus, there are $15-5=10$ non-observed pairs. We compute their scores:\n    - $S(0,4) = k_0 \\cdot k_4 = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$\n    - $S(0,5) = k_0 \\cdot k_5 = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$\n    - $S(1,3) = k_1 \\cdot k_3 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n    - $S(1,4) = k_1 \\cdot k_4 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n    - $S(1,5) = k_1 \\cdot k_5 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n    - $S(2,3) = k_2 \\cdot k_3 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n    - $S(2,4) = k_2 \\cdot k_4 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n    - $S(2,5) = k_2 \\cdot k_5 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n    - $S(3,4) = k_3 \\cdot k_4 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n    - $S(3,5) = k_3 \\cdot k_5 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n\n3.  **Rank Candidate Pairs**: We sort these $10$ pairs.\n    - Pairs with score $S=3$: $(0,4), (0,5)$. In lexicographical order: $(0,4)$, then $(0,5)$.\n    - Pairs with score $S=2$: $(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)$. In lexicographical order.\n    - Pairs with score $S=1$: $(3,4), (3,5)$. In lexicographical order.\n    The complete ranked list starts as:\n    1. $\\{0,4\\}$ (Score $3$)\n    2. $\\{0,5\\}$ (Score $3$)\n    3. $\\{1,3\\}$ (Score $2$)\n    4. $\\{1,4\\}$ (Score $2$)\n    ... and so on.\n\n4.  **Select Predictions and Evaluate**: With $L=2$, we select the top two pairs: $\\{0,4\\}$ and $\\{0,5\\}$.\n    - We determine the set of true missing links: $E_{\\mathrm{miss}} = E_{\\mathrm{true}} \\setminus E_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\{(0,4), (2,3)\\}$.\n    - We check our predictions against $E_{\\mathrm{miss}}$:\n        - Is $\\{0,4\\}$ in $E_{\\mathrm{miss}}$? Yes.\n        - Is $\\{0,5\\}$ in $E_{\\mathrm{miss}}$? No.\n    - The number of correct predictions is $1$.\n\nThe result for Test Case A is $1$.
