All givens, definitions, and constraints have been extracted and analyzed. The problem is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in computational time series analysis, specifically concerning the properties of autoregressive models. The parameters for the test cases are chosen such that the specified conditions for stationarity and oscillatory behavior are met. For an $\\text{AR}(2)$ process $X_{t} = \\phi_{1} X_{t-1} + \\phi_{2} X_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_{t}$, stationarity requires that the roots of the characteristic polynomial $1 - \\phi_{1} z - \\phi_{2} z^{2} = 0$ lie outside the unit circle. This is equivalent to the conditions $\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2}  1$, $\\phi_{2} - \\phi_{1}  1$, and $|\\phi_{2}|  1$. Oscillatory behavior, which leads to a sinusoidal autocorrelation function, requires the roots to be complex, which occurs when $\\phi_{1}^{2} + 4\\phi_{2}  0$. All three provided parameter sets $(\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2})$ satisfy these conditions. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe task is to simulate a second-order autoregressive, $\\text{AR}(2)$, process and verify that its sample statistics conform to theoretical expectations. Specifically, for an $\\text{AR}(2)$ process with complex characteristic roots, the theoretical autocorrelation function (ACF) exhibits behavior analogous to a damped sinusoid, while the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) cuts off after lag $2$. We will implement the necessary algorithms from first principles to verify this behavior for given sample data.\n\nFirst, we simulate the $\\text{AR}(2)$ process defined by $X_{t} = \\phi_{1} X_{t-1} + \\phi_{2} X_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_{t}$, where $\\varepsilon_{t}$ is a white noise process with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2=1$. A burn-in period is used to ensure the simulated series approximates a weakly stationary process. The initial values $X_0$ and $X_{-1}$ are set to $0$. After generating a total of $n + \\text{burn\\_in}$ points, the first $\\text{burn\\_in}$ samples are discarded, leaving a series of length $n$.\n\nNext, we compute the sample statistics. The sample mean is estimated as $\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^{n} X_{t}$. Using this, we compute the sample autocovariance sequence $\\{\\hat{\\gamma}_{k}\\}_{k=0}^{K}$ according to the specified formula:\n$$\n\\hat{\\gamma}_{k} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=k+1}^{n} (X_{t} - \\hat{\\mu})(X_{t-k} - \\hat{\\mu})\n$$\nThis is a biased estimator, as the sum contains $n-k$ terms while the divisor is $n$. The sample autocorrelation function (ACF) is then computed as $\\hat{\\rho}_{k} = \\hat{\\gamma}_{k}/\\hat{\\gamma}_{0}$ for lags $k=0, 1, \\dots, K$.\n\nThe core of the analysis is the computation of the sample partial autocorrelation function (PACF), denoted $\\{\\hat{\\alpha}_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{K}$. The PACF at lag $k$, $\\alpha_k$, is defined as the last coefficient, $\\phi_{k,k}$, in an autoregressive model of order $k$ fitted to the data. These coefficients are determined by the Yule–Walker equations, which relate the model coefficients to the autocorrelations:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\rho_1  \\dots  \\rho_{k-1} \\\\ \\rho_1  1  \\dots  \\rho_{k-2} \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\ \\rho_{k-1}  \\rho_{k-2}  \\dots  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_{k,1} \\\\ \\phi_{k,2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\phi_{k,k} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_1 \\\\ \\rho_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\rho_k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe solve this system for $\\phi_{k,k}$ for each lag $k=1, \\dots, K$ using the computationally efficient Levinson–Durbin recursion. Given the sample autocorrelations $\\{\\hat{\\rho}_k\\}$, the sample PACF coefficients $\\{\\hat{\\alpha}_k = \\hat{\\phi}_{k,k}\\}$ are computed recursively.\nFor $k=1$:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha}_1 = \\hat{\\phi}_{1,1} = \\hat{\\rho}_1 $$\nFor $k  1$:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha}_k = \\hat{\\phi}_{k,k} = \\frac{\\hat{\\rho}_k - \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \\hat{\\phi}_{k-1,j} \\hat{\\rho}_{k-j}}{1 - \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \\hat{\\phi}_{k-1,j} \\hat{\\rho}_{j}} $$\nThe other coefficients for the intermediate $\\text{AR}(k)$ model are updated as:\n$$ \\hat{\\phi}_{k,j} = \\hat{\\phi}_{k-1,j} - \\hat{\\alpha}_k \\hat{\\phi}_{k-1,k-j} \\quad \\text{for } j=1, \\dots, k-1 $$\nThis algorithm is applied iteratively for $k=1, \\dots, K$ to obtain the full sample PACF sequence.\n\nFinally, we apply the specified verification criteria. The ACF is deemed to have a \"clear sinusoidal pattern\" if two conditions are met:\n$1$. The number of sign changes in the sequence $\\{\\hat{\\rho}_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{K}$, considering only terms where $|\\hat{\\rho}_{k}| \\ge \\varepsilon = 0.05$, must be at least $S_{\\min} = 3$.\n$2$. The magnitude must exhibit overall decay, specified as $|\\hat{\\rho}_{K}|  |\\hat{\\rho}_{1}|$.\n\nThe PACF is declared to \"not have a sinusoidal pattern\" if it effectively cuts off after the true model order of $2$. This is tested by the condition:\n$$ \\max_{k \\in \\{3,4,\\dots,K\\}} |\\hat{\\alpha}_{k}| \\le \\tau $$\nwhere the tolerance is $\\tau = 0.30$.\n\nA test case passes verification if and only if both the ACF and PACF criteria are satisfied.

The process is defined as:\n$$\ny_t = \\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{i=0}^{4} x_{t-i}\n$$\nwhere $\\{x_t\\}$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean $E[x_t] = 0$ and variance $\\text{Var}(x_t) = E[x_t^2] = \\sigma^2$.\n\nThe mean of the process $\\{y_t\\}$ is:\n$$\nE[y_t] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{i=0}^{4} x_{t-i}\\right] = \\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{i=0}^{4} E[x_{t-i}] = 0\n$$\nThe process $\\{y_t\\}$ is thus zero-mean. The autocovariance function, $\\gamma_k = E[y_t y_{t-k}]$, determines its correlation structure. The variance of the process is the autocovariance at lag $k=0$:\n$$\n\\gamma_0 = E[y_t^2] = E\\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{i=0}^{4} x_{t-i}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{25} E\\left[ \\sum_{i=0}^{4}\\sum_{j=0}^{4} x_{t-i}x_{t-j} \\right]\n$$\nDue to the i.i.d. nature of $\\{x_t\\}$, the expectation $E[x_{t-i}x_{t-j}]$ is non-zero only when the time indices match, i.e., $t-i=t-j$, which implies $i=j$. In this case, $E[x_{t-i}^2] = \\sigma^2$.\n$$\n\\gamma_0 = \\frac{1}{25} \\sum_{i=0}^{4} E[x_{t-i}^2] = \\frac{1}{25} \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\sigma^2 = \\frac{5\\sigma^2}{25} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{5}\n$$\nFor a lag $k  0$, the autocovariance is:\n$$\n\\gamma_k = E[y_t y_{t-k}] = \\frac{1}{25} E\\left[ \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} x_{t-i}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{4} x_{t-k-j}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe cross-term $E[x_{t-i}x_{t-k-j}]$ is non-zero only if $t-i = t-k-j$, which simplifies to $j=i-k$. We must count the number of pairs $(i,j)$ that satisfy this condition, subject to the constraints $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The number of such pairs is $5-k$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nFor $k=1$, we have $4$ pairs: $(1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3)$. Thus, $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{25}$.\nFor $k=2$, we have $3$ pairs: $(2,0), (3,1), (4,2)$. Thus, $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{3\\sigma^2}{25}$.\nFor $k=3$, we have $2$ pairs: $(3,0), (4,1)$. Thus, $\\gamma_3 = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{25}$.\nFor $k=4$, we have $1$ pair: $(4,0)$. Thus, $\\gamma_4 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{25}$.\nFor $k \\ge 5$, no pairs $(i, j)$ satisfy the condition $j=i-k$ within the specified ranges, so the filter windows do not overlap. Consequently, $\\gamma_k = 0$ for all $k \\ge 5$.\n\nThe population ACF is $\\rho_k = \\gamma_k / \\gamma_0$. Notice that $\\sigma^2$ cancels out.\n$$\n\\rho_k = \\frac{(5-k)\\sigma^2/25}{5\\sigma^2/25} = \\frac{5-k}{5} = 1 - \\frac{k}{5} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\n$$\nSpecifically, the required values for metric $e_1$ are:\n- $\\rho_1 = 4/5 = 0.8$\n- $\\rho_2 = 3/5 = 0.6$\n- $\\rho_3 = 2/5 = 0.4$\n- $\\rho_4 = 1/5 = 0.2$\n\nThe computational procedure involves simulating the process and calculating sample statistics.\n1.  For each test case $(T, \\sigma, \\text{seed})$, a sequence $\\{x_t\\}_{t=0}^{T-1}$ of $T$ i.i.d. random variables is generated from a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ using the specified pseudo-random seed.\n2.  The filtered series $\\{y_t\\}$ is constructed by convolving $\\{x_t\\}$ with the filter kernel $[1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5]$. The 'valid' part of the convolution is taken, which corresponds to indices where the filter fully overlaps with the data, yielding a sample of length $n = T-4$. This sample is denoted $\\{y_0, \\dots, y_{n-1}\\}$ for computation, where $y_j$ corresponds to the process value at original time $t=j+4$.\n3.  The sample autocorrelation function (ACF) $\\{\\hat r_k\\}_{k=0}^{K}$ for $K=20$ is computed using the formula provided:\n    $$\n    \\hat r_k = \\frac{\\sum_{t=k}^{n-1} (y_t-\\bar y)(y_{t-k}-\\bar y)}{\\sum_{t=0}^{n-1} (y_t-\\bar y)^2}\n    $$\n    where $\\bar y$ is the sample mean of $\\{y_0, \\dots, y_{n-1}\\}$. The denominator is the total sum of squares of the mean-centered data, and the numerator is the sample autocovariance at lag $k$.\n4.  The sample partial autocorrelation function (PACF) $\\{\\widehat\\phi_k\\}_{k=1}^{K}$ for $K=20$ is computed. The value $\\widehat\\phi_k$ is defined as the last coefficient in the solution to the $k$-th order Yule-Walker equations. For each lag $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}$, we solve the system $\\mathbf{R}_k \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_k = \\mathbf{r}_k$, where $\\mathbf{R}_k$ is a $k \\times k$ Toeplitz matrix of sample autocorrelations $(\\mathbf{R}_k)_{ij} = \\hat r_{|i-j|}$, and $\\mathbf{r}_k = [\\hat r_1, \\dots, \\hat r_k]^T$. The PACF coefficient $\\widehat\\phi_k$ is the $k$-th element of the solution vector $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_k$. This system is efficiently solved using a specialized Toeplitz solver. For $k=1$, $\\widehat\\phi_1$ is simply $\\hat r_1$.\n5.  With the theoretical values $\\{\\rho_k\\}$ and sample statistics $\\{\\hat r_k\\}, \\{\\widehat\\phi_k\\}$ computed, the final metrics are calculated as specified:\n    - $e_1 = \\max_{k \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}} | \\hat r_k - \\rho_k |$: This metric measures the maximum deviation of the sample ACF from the true ACF for the lags where the correlation is non-zero.\n    - $e_2 = \\max_{k \\in \\{5,6,\\dots,20\\}} | \\hat r_k |$: This metric quantifies the magnitude of the sample ACF in the tail, where the true ACF is zero. For an MA process, the ACF should ideally cut off after lag $q=4$.\n    - $e_3 = (\\frac{1}{15}\\sum_{k=6}^{20} |\\widehat\\phi_k|) / (|\\widehat\\phi_1| + 10^{-12})$: This metric assesses the behavior of the PACF tail. For an MA process, the PACF is expected to decay exponentially, not cut off. This metric computes the average magnitude of the PACF tail (from lag $6$ onwards) relative to the magnitude of the first PACF coefficient.\n\nThe implementation will follow these steps precisely for each test case provided.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import solve_toeplitz\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the time series analysis problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (T, sigma, seed)\n        (1000, 1.0, 11),\n        (200, 2.0, 22),\n        (80, 0.5, 33),\n        (50, 1.0, 44),\n        (25, 1.0, 55),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for T, sigma, seed in test_cases:\n        # Set maximum lag for analysis\n        K = 20\n\n        # Step 1: Generate white noise process {x_t}\n        rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n        x = rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=sigma, size=T)\n\n        # Step 2: Construct filtered series {y_t} via moving average\n        filter_coeffs = np.full(5, 1.0/5.0)\n        # 'valid' convolution generates the series y_t for t=4..T-1\n        # The resulting sample is of length n = T - 4\n        y = np.convolve(x, filter_coeffs, mode='valid')\n        n = len(y)\n\n        # Step 3: Compute sample autocorrelations {r_k}\n        y_mean = np.mean(y)\n        y_demeaned = y - y_mean\n        \n        # The denominator is constant for all lags\n        denom_acf = np.sum(y_demeaned**2)\n        \n        # Ensure denominator is not zero to avoid division errors, though unlikely\n        if denom_acf == 0:\n            r_hat = np.zeros(K + 1)\n        else:\n            r_hat = np.zeros(K + 1)\n            for k in range(K + 1):\n                # Numerator is the sample autocovariance at lag k\n                # sum_{t=k}^{n-1} (y_t-y_bar)(y_{t-k}-y_bar)\n                num_acf = np.dot(y_demeaned[k:], y_demeaned[:n-k])\n                r_hat[k] = num_acf / denom_acf\n\n        # Step 4: Compute sample partial autocorrelations {phi_k}\n        phi_hat = np.zeros(K + 1)  # Index 0 is unused, phi_hat[k] stores phi_k\n        if n  1:\n            phi_hat[1] = r_hat[1]\n        \n            for k in range(2, K + 1):\n                if k = n: # Cannot compute if lag k is too large for sample\n                    continue\n                # Solve Yule-Walker equations for PACF at lag k\n                # R_k * phi_k = r_k\n                # R_k is a Toeplitz matrix formed by r_hat[0]...r_hat[k-1]\n                # c is the first column of the Toeplitz matrix\n                c = r_hat[:k]\n                # b is the right-hand side vector\n                b = r_hat[1:k+1]\n                \n                try:\n                    # solve_toeplitz returns the solution to phi_k = [phi_k1, ..., phi_kk]\n                    solution = solve_toeplitz((c, c), b, check_finite=False)\n                    # The PACF at lag k is the last coefficient, phi_kk\n                    phi_hat[k] = solution[-1]\n                except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n                    # Matrix is singular, PACF is ill-defined.
