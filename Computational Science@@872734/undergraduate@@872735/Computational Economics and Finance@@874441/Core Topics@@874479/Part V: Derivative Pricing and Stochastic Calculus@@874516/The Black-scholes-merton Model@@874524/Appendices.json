The provided SDE is the canonical representation of an asset with a continuous dividend yield under the risk-neutral measure. It adheres to fundamental principles of financial mathematics.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary parameters ($S_0$, $K$, $r$, $q$, $T$, $\\sigma$) for pricing within the BSM model are provided. The objective is clearly stated, and the framework guarantees the existence of a unique arbitrage-free price due to market completeness. The term “Boston option” is explicitly defined by its payoff function, avoiding ambiguity.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal mathematical language, devoid of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that the arbitrage-free price of a derivative security at time $t=0$, which we denote as $V_0$, is the expected value of its discounted future payoffs, calculated under the risk-neutral probability measure $Q$. The payoff of the specified contract at time $T$ is $S_T - K$. The discounting factor from time $T$ to time $0$ is $\\exp(-rT)$.\n\nThus, the price $V_0$ is given by:\n$$\nV_0 = E_Q[\\exp(-rT)(S_T - K)]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, we can separate the terms:\n$$\nV_0 = E_Q[\\exp(-rT)S_T] - E_Q[\\exp(-rT)K]\n$$\nSince $K$ and $\\exp(-rT)$ are constants (non-stochastic), the second term simplifies to:\n$$\nE_Q[\\exp(-rT)K] = K\\exp(-rT)\n$$\nThe first term requires calculating the expected value of the asset price $S_T$ under the risk-neutral measure. We are given the risk-neutral SDE for $S_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}S_t = (r - q)S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nTo solve for $S_T$, we consider the process for $X_t = \\ln(S_t)$. Using Itô's lemma for a function $f(S_t) = \\ln(S_t)$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S} \\mathrm{d}S_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S^2} (\\mathrm{d}S_t)^2\n$$\nThe derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S} = \\frac{1}{S_t}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S^2} = -\\frac{1}{S_t^2}$. The quadratic variation term is $(\\mathrm{d}S_t)^2 = (\\sigma S_t \\mathrm{d}W_t)^2 = \\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\mathrm{d}t$. Substituting these into the Itô's lemma expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\frac{1}{S_t}((r - q)S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{S_t^2}\\right) (\\sigma^2 S_t^2 \\mathrm{d}t)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_t = (r - q)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\left(r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t=T$:\n$$\n\\int_0^T \\mathrm{d}X_t = \\int_0^T \\left(r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\int_0^T \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\n$$\nX_T - X_0 = \\left(r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T + \\sigma (W_T - W_0)\n$$\nSince $X_t = \\ln(S_t)$ and $W_0=0$, we have:\n$$\n\\ln(S_T) = \\ln(S_0) + \\left(r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T + \\sigma W_T\n$$\nUnder the measure $Q$, $W_T$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $T$, i.e., $W_T \\sim N(0, T)$. Therefore, $\\ln(S_T)$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu = \\ln(S_0) + (r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T$ and variance $\\nu^2 = \\sigma^2 T$.\n\nThe asset price $S_T$ is log-normally distributed. The expectation of a log-normal random variable $Y$ where $\\ln(Y) \\sim N(\\mu, \\nu^2)$ is given by $E[Y] = \\exp(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\nu^2)$. Applying this to $S_T$:\n$$\nE_Q[S_T] = \\exp\\left(\\left(\\ln(S_0) + \\left(r - q - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma^2 T)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_Q[S_T] = \\exp\\left(\\ln(S_0) + rT - qT - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 T + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 T\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_Q[S_T] = \\exp(\\ln(S_0) + (r - q)T) = \\exp(\\ln(S_0))\\exp((r-q)T)\n$$\n$$\nE_Q[S_T] = S_0 \\exp((r-q)T)\n$$\nThis result confirms that the expected future price under the risk-neutral measure is the forward price. Now we substitute this expectation back into the valuation formula:\n$$\nV_0 = \\exp(-rT)E_Q[S_T] - K\\exp(-rT)\n$$\n$$\nV_0 = \\exp(-rT) \\left(S_0 \\exp((r-q)T)\\right) - K\\exp(-rT)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nV_0 = S_0 \\exp(-rT + (r-q)T) - K\\exp(-rT)\n$$\n$$\nV_0 = S_0 \\exp(-qT) - K\\exp(-rT)\n$$\nThis expression is the arbitrage-free price at time $t=0$. The contract is, in fact, a forward contract with a predetermined delivery price $K$.

Substituting this identity into the third term of the expression for $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = S_{0} N'(d_1) \\frac{\\sqrt{T}}{\\sigma} + TK \\exp(-rT) N(d_2) - S_{0} N'(d_1) \\frac{\\sqrt{T}}{\\sigma} $$\nThe first and third terms cancel, yielding the simplified formula for rho:\n$$ \\rho = K T \\exp(-rT) N(d_2) $$\nNow, we substitute the given parameters into our formulae:\n$S_{0} = 100$\n$K = 100$\n$T = 100$ years\n$r = 0.02$ per year\n$\\sigma = 0.20$ per year\n\nFirst, we compute $d_1$ and $d_2$:\nSince $S_{0}=K$, the term $\\ln(S_{0}/K) = \\ln(1) = 0$.\n$$ d_1 = \\frac{0 + \\left(0.02 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.20)^{2}\\right) \\times 100}{0.20\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{\\left(0.02 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)\\right) \\times 100}{0.20 \\times 10} = \\frac{(0.02 + 0.02) \\times 100}{2} = \\frac{0.04 \\times 100}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 $$\n$$ d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T} = 2 - 0.20\\sqrt{100} = 2 - 2 = 0 $$\nNext, we evaluate $N(d_2)$:\n$$ N(d_2) = N(0) $$\nThe value of the standard normal CDF at $0$ is precisely $0.5$, due to the symmetry of the distribution around its mean of $0$.\n$$ N(0) = 0.5 $$\nFinally, we substitute these values into the formula for $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = K T \\exp(-rT) N(d_2) = 100 \\times 100 \\times \\exp(-0.02 \\times 100) \\times 0.5 $$\n$$ \\rho = 10000 \\times \\exp(-2) \\times 0.5 = 5000 \\exp(-2) $$\nTo find the numerical value, we compute:\n$$ \\rho \\approx 5000 \\times 0.13533528... \\approx 676.6764... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required gives $676.7$.\n\nThe interpretation of rho is the rate of change of the option price with respect to the risk-free interest rate. A value of $\\rho = 676.7$ signifies that for a $1$ unit increase in the annualized continuously compounded risk-free rate (e.g., from $r=0.02$ to $r=1.02$), the option's price is expected to increase by approximately $676.7$ currency units, all else being equal. More practically, for a $1\\%$ increase in the interest rate (i.e., $\\Delta r = 0.01$), the option price would increase by approximately $676.7 \\times 0.01 = 6.767$ currency units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{676.7}$$", "id": "2438207"}]}
