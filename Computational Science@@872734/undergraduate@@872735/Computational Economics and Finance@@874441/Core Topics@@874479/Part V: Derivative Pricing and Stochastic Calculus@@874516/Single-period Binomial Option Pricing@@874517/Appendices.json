We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to work within a single-period binomial model. The price of any derivative security in this framework, under the assumption of no arbitrage, is its discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral probability measure.\n\nFirst, we determine the risk-neutral probability, $q$, for the stock price to move up. The price of a European call option, $C_0$, is given by the formula:\n$$C_0 = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\left[ q \\cdot C_u + (1-q) \\cdot C_d \\right]$$\nwhere $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, $C_u$ is the option's payoff if the stock price goes up, and $C_d$ is the payoff if the stock price goes down.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Current stock price: $S_0 = 100$\n- Up-factor: $u = 1.20$\n- Down-factor: $d = 0.80$\n- Simple risk-free interest rate: $r = 0.05$, so the gross risk-free factor is $1+r = 1.05$\n- Strike price: $K = 115$\n- Observed time-zero call price: $C_0 = \\frac{125}{42}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the possible stock prices at the end of the period:\n- Up-state price: $S_u = u \\cdot S_0 = 1.20 \\times 100 = 120$\n- Down-state price: $S_d = d \\cdot S_0 = 0.80 \\times 100 = 80$\n\nNext, we calculate the payoffs of the European call option in each state:\n- Payoff in the up-state: $C_u = \\max(S_u - K, 0) = \\max(120 - 115, 0) = 5$\n- Payoff in the down-state: $C_d = \\max(S_d - K, 0) = \\max(80 - 115, 0) = 0$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the call option pricing formula to solve for the implied risk-neutral probability $q$:\n$$\\frac{125}{42} = \\frac{1}{1.05} \\left[ q \\cdot 5 + (1-q) \\cdot 0 \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{125}{42} = \\frac{5q}{1.05}$$\nSolving for $q$:\n$$q = \\frac{125}{42} \\cdot \\frac{1.05}{5}$$\nTo compute this precisely, we can use fractions: $1.05 = \\frac{105}{100} = \\frac{21}{20}$.\n$$q = \\frac{125}{42} \\cdot \\frac{21/20}{5} = \\frac{125}{42} \\cdot \\frac{21}{100} = \\frac{125}{100} \\cdot \\frac{21}{42} = \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{8}$$\nAs a decimal, $q = 0.625$.

The introduction of a government price floor is a well-defined modification to the asset's terminal payoffs.\n\nBefore the policy, the no-arbitrage condition $d  R  u$ must hold.

Therefore, the problem is well-posed and a unique solution exists. The problem statement is valid.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The no-arbitrage price of the option is its discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure. The price $P_0$ is given by:\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{1}{R} [q P_1(u) + (1-q) P_1(d)] $$\nwhere $P_1(u)$ and $P_1(d)$ are the option payoffs in the up and down states, and $q$ is the risk-neutral probability.\n\nCrucially, the risk-neutral probability $q$ is determined by the tradable underlying asset. Since the policy has altered the asset's payoff structure, the risk-neutral probability must be recalculated based on the new terminal prices $S_1(u)$ and $S_1(d)$. The risk-neutral probability $q$ is the value that makes the expected return on the asset equal to the risk-free rate:\n$$ S_0 R = q S_1(u) + (1-q) S_1(d) $$\nSolving for $q$:\n$$ q = \\frac{R S_0 - S_1(d)}{S_1(u) - S_1(d)} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ q = \\frac{1.05 \\times \\$100 - \\$90}{\\$120 - \\$90} = \\frac{\\$105 - \\$90}{\\$30} = \\frac{\\$15}{\\$30} = 0.5 $$\nThe risk-neutral probability of an up-move is $q=0.5$.\n\nNext, we calculate the payoffs of the European put option at expiration ($t=1$). The payoff is $\\max\\{K-S_1, 0\\}$.\n- Payoff in the up state: $P_1(u) = \\max\\{\\$100 - S_1(u), 0\\} = \\max\\{\\$100 - \\$120, 0\\} = \\$0$.\n- Payoff in the down state: $P_1(d) = \\max\\{\\$100 - S_1(d), 0\\} = \\max\\{\\$100 - \\$90, 0\\} = \\$10$.\n\nFinally, we compute the option's price at $t=0$ by discounting the expected payoff:\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{1}{1.05} [0.5 \\times \\$0 + (1-0.5) \\times \\$10] $$\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{1}{1.05} [0.5 \\times \\$10] = \\frac{\\$5}{1.05} $$\nTo compute the exact fraction, we can write $1.05 = \\frac{105}{100} = \\frac{21}{20}$.\n$$ P_0 = \\$5 \\times \\frac{20}{21} = \\frac{\\$100}{21} \\approx \\$4.761904... $$\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n- **A. $\\$8.571$**: This value, approximately $\\$60/7$, would be the price of the put option in the *absence* of the price floor.

Hence, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. $\\$14.286$**: This value is much higher than even the original put price. A policy that limits the downside of the underlying cannot increase the value of a put option. This option is logically unsound. Hence, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. The price is not uniquely determined under the policy.**: This would be true if the market became incomplete (i.e., $S_1(u)=S_1(d)$) or if arbitrage were possible.
