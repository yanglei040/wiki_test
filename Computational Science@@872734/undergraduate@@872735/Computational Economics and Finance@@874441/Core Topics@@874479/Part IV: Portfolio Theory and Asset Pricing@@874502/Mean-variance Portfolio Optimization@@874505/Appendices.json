{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Standard mean-variance optimization often assumes that short selling is allowed, leading to a smooth, hyperbolic efficient frontier. In practice, however, many investment mandates prohibit short positions. This exercise guides you through the process of constructing the efficient frontier under this more realistic no-short-selling constraint, revealing its piecewise nature and introducing the key concept of \"corner portfolios\" that define it [@problem_id:2383613].", "problem": "Consider a mean-variance portfolio selection problem under no-short-selling constraints. Let there be $n$ risky assets with expected return vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and positive definite covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. A portfolio is represented by weights $\\boldsymbol{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\boldsymbol{1}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = 1$ and $\\boldsymbol{w} \\succeq \\boldsymbol{0}$. For a target expected return $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the mean-variance efficient portfolio solves the convex optimization problem of minimizing the variance $ \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w}$ subject to the constraints $\\boldsymbol{1}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = 1$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = r$, and $\\boldsymbol{w} \\succeq \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n\nA corner portfolio (also called a critical portfolio) is defined as an efficient portfolio at a target return $r$ at which the set of active inequality constraints changes, that is, at least one component of $\\boldsymbol{w}$ hits $0$ or leaves $0$ as $r$ varies. Between two adjacent corner portfolios, the set of assets with strictly positive weights remains constant.\n\nYour tasks are:\n- Starting from the fundamental definitions above, implement an algorithm that:\n  1. Computes the minimum-variance portfolio under $\\boldsymbol{1}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = 1$ and $\\boldsymbol{w} \\succeq \\boldsymbol{0}$, and records its expected return $r_{\\mathrm{mv}} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w}_{\\mathrm{mv}}$.\n  2. Constructs the efficient frontier over target returns $r \\in [r_{\\mathrm{mv}}, \\max_i \\mu_i]$ by solving, for a grid of $r$ values, the variance-minimization problem under $\\boldsymbol{1}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = 1$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = r$, and $\\boldsymbol{w} \\succeq \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n  3. Identifies corner portfolios by detecting return levels at which the active asset set (indices of strictly positive weights) changes. Refine each detected change via bisection on $r$ so that the change point is located to within a tolerance of $10^{-6}$ in $r$.\n  4. Demonstrates the following property computationally: for any efficient portfolio at a target $r$ that lies between two adjacent corner portfolios with target returns $r_{\\ell}$ and $r_u$ (where $r_{\\ell} \\le r \\le r_u$), the optimal weights $\\boldsymbol{w}(r)$ are equal, within a numerical tolerance, to a convex combination $\\tau \\boldsymbol{w}(r_u) + (1-\\tau)\\boldsymbol{w}(r_\\ell)$ for some $\\tau \\in [0,1]$ chosen so that the combined portfolio has expected return $r$.\n- Use the following tolerance conventions in your algorithm:\n  - Treat any weight less than or equal to $10^{-8}$ as zero for the purpose of determining the active set.\n  - When checking equality of two weight vectors, accept a maximum absolute deviation of at most $5 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nYou must implement your algorithm and apply it to the following test suite, where each test case specifies $(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$:\n\n- Test case $1$ (two assets):\n  - $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = [\\,0.08,\\, 0.12\\,]$.\n  - $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.04 & 0.006 \\\\ 0.006 & 0.09 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n- Test case $2$ (three assets, one dominated by construction):\n  - $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = [\\,0.06,\\, 0.10,\\, 0.03\\,]$.\n  - $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0.0422 & 0.0134 & 0.0418 \\\\\n  0.0134 & 0.0343 & 0.0276 \\\\\n  0.0418 & 0.0276 & 0.1062\n  \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n- Test case $3$ (three assets, all relevant):\n  - $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = [\\,0.06,\\, 0.11,\\, 0.08\\,]$.\n  - $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0.02 & 0.015 & 0.005 \\\\\n  0.015 & 0.05 & 0.01 \\\\\n  0.005 & 0.01 & 0.03\n  \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nFor each test case, you must:\n- Report the total number of corner portfolios detected on the efficient frontier over $r \\in [r_{\\mathrm{mv}}, \\max_i \\mu_i]$.\n- Verify the convex-combination property by sampling at least $5$ evenly spaced target returns in $[r_{\\mathrm{mv}}, \\max_i \\mu_i]$ and checking whether each efficient portfolio lies within the specified tolerance of the convex combination of its adjacent corner portfolios.

No physical units apply in this problem, and all returns are decimals (for example, write $0.12$ instead of $12$ percent).", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in computational finance related to Markowitz mean-variance optimization. It requires the construction of an efficient frontier for a portfolio of risky assets under a no-short-selling constraint ($\\boldsymbol{w} \\succeq \\boldsymbol{0}$). This task is fundamentally a convex Quadratic Programming (QP) problem. The problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, as the objective function $\\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w}$ is strictly convex (given $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is positive definite) and the constraints define a non-empty compact convex set for any feasible target return $r$. Therefore, a unique solution exists. We proceed with a direct implementation of the required algorithm.\n\nThe central optimization problem is formulated as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underset{\\boldsymbol{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n}{\\text{minimize}}\n& & \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{w}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{w} \\\\\n& \\text{subject to}\n& & \\boldsymbol{1}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = 1, \\\\\n& & & \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = r, \\\\\n& & & w_i \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, n.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is the vector of portfolio weights, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ is the vector of expected returns, $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix, and $r$ is the target expected return. We use the Sequential Least Squares Programming (`SLSQP`) method provided by `scipy.optimize.minimize` to solve this QP problem for given parameters $(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}, r)$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in three main stages as per the problem specification.\n\nFirst, the relevant range of the efficient frontier is established. The lower bound is the expected return $r_{\\mathrm{mv}}$ of the global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP) under the no-short-selling constraint. This portfolio, $\\boldsymbol{w}_{\\mathrm{mv}}$, is found by solving the QP problem without the target return constraint ($\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^\\top \\boldsymbol{w} = r$). The upper bound is the maximum possible expected return, $r_{\\max} = \\max_i \\mu_i$, achieved by allocating $100\\%$ of the investment to the single asset with the highest expected return. The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios for target returns $r \\in [r_{\\mathrm{mv}}, r_{\\max}]$.\n\nSecond, the corner portfolios are identified. A corner portfolio corresponds to a point on the efficient frontier where the set of assets with strictly positive weights (the active set) changes. Our procedure to find them is as follows:\n$1$. A fine grid of $1001$ target returns is generated over the interval $[r_{\\mathrm{mv}}, r_{\\max}]$.\n$2$. For each return $r_j$ in this grid, we solve the QP to find the optimal weights $\\boldsymbol{w}(r_j)$. We define the active set as the indices $i$ for which $w_i(r_j) > 10^{-8}$.\n$3$. We scan the grid and identify adjacent points $(r_j, r_{j+1})$ where the computed active sets differ. Such an interval must contain a corner portfolio.\n$4$. For each identified interval, a bisection search is performed to find the critical return $r_c$ at which the active set changes. The search refines the location of $r_c$ until the width of the search interval is less than $10^{-6}$.\n$5$. The final list of corner portfolios comprises the GMVP, the maximum-return portfolio, and all unique portfolios found through the bisection search. The list is sorted by return and de-duplicated to handle cases where the same corner is found from multiple grid intervals. The total number of these unique corner portfolios is then reported.\n\nThird, we computationally verify the two-fund separation property, which states that any efficient portfolio between two adjacent corner portfolios is a convex combination of those two corner portfolios. The verification is conducted as follows:\n$1$. A sample of at least $5$ evenly spaced target returns $\\{r_k\\}$ is generated over the entire range $[r_{\\mathrm{mv}}, r_{\\max}]$.\n$2$. For each $r_k$, we compute the optimal portfolio $\\boldsymbol{w}_{actual}(r_k)$ directly using the QP solver.\n$3$. We identify the two adjacent corner portfolios, $(r_\\ell, \\boldsymbol{w}_\\ell)$ and $(r_u, \\boldsymbol{w}_u)$, that bracket $r_k$, i.e., $r_\\ell \\le r_k \\le r_u$.\n$4$. We calculate the theoretical portfolio $\\boldsymbol{w}_{theory}(r_k)$ using the convex combination $\\boldsymbol{w}_{theory}(r_k) = (1-\\tau) \\boldsymbol{w}_\\ell + \\tau \\boldsymbol{w}_u$, where the interpolation factor $\\tau = (r_k - r_\\ell) / (r_u - r_\\ell)$ ensures that the expected return of the combination is $r_k$.\n$5$. We then check if $\\boldsymbol{w}_{actual}(r_k)$ and $\\boldsymbol{w}_{theory}(r_k)$ are equal within the specified numerical tolerance. The check passes if the maximum absolute difference between their corresponding weights, $\\max_i |w_{actual,i}(r_k) - w_{theory,i}(r_k)|$, is no more than $5 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n$6$. The overall verification for a test case is deemed successful (True) if and only if this condition holds for all sampled returns.\n\nThis comprehensive procedure is systematically applied to all test cases to generate the required results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve_qp(target_r, mu, Sigma, n):\n    \"\"\"Solves the quadratic programming problem for a given target return.\"\"\"\n    objective = lambda w: w.T @ Sigma @ w\n    w0 = np.ones(n) / n\n    constraints = [\n        {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: np.sum(w) - 1.0},\n        {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: w.T @ mu - target_r}\n    ]\n    bounds = tuple((0, None) for _ in range(n))\n    \n    result = minimize(objective, w0, method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints, tol=1e-9)\n    # The problem is constructed to be feasible, so success is expected.\n    return result.x\n\ndef process_case(mu, Sigma):\n    \"\"\"\n    Processes a single test case: finds corner portfolios and verifies the\n    convex combination property.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(mu)\n    weight_tol = 1e-8\n    bisection_tol = 1e-6\n    vector_comp_tol = 5e-4\n\n    # 1.

This is a problem in computational finance, specifically portfolio optimization under the mean-variance framework developed by Markowitz.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the portfolio weight vector $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ that minimizes portfolio variance, $w^{\\top} \\Sigma w$, for a given target expected return, $r_{\\text{tgt}}$. This is formulated as a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem.\n\n**1. Problem Formulation**\n\nFor a given covariance matrix $\\Sigma$, expected return vector $\\mu$, and target return $r_{\\text{tgt}}$, the optimization problem is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n \\underset{w}{\\text{minimize}}\n  w^{\\top} \\Sigma w \\\\\n \\text{subject to}\n  w^{\\top} \\mu = r_{\\text{tgt}} \\\\\n   \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} w = 1 \\\\\n   w \\succeq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $w$ is the vector of portfolio weights, $n$ is the number of assets, $\\mathbf{1}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of ones, and $w \\succeq 0$ denotes element-wise non-negativity (no short selling). The solution to this problem gives the minimum variance for a target return $r_{\\text{tgt}}$. The standard deviation is the square root of this minimum variance.\n\n**2. Covariance Matrix Construction**\n\nTwo covariance matrices must be constructed for each test case.\n\nFirst, the factor model covariance matrix, $\\Sigma_{\\text{fac}}$, is constructed as:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\text{fac}} = B \\Sigma_F B^{\\top} + D\n$$\nwhere $B$ is the $n \\times k$ matrix of factor exposures, $\\Sigma_F$ is the $k \\times k$ factor covariance matrix, and $D$ is the $n \\times n$ diagonal matrix of idiosyncratic variances. Given that $\\Sigma_F$ is specified as a diagonal matrix with positive entries, it is positive definite. $D$ is also diagonal with positive entries and thus positive definite. The term $B \\Sigma_F B^{\\top}$ is positive semidefinite. The sum of a positive definite matrix ($D$) and a positive semidefinite matrix ($B \\Sigma_F B^{\\top}$) results in a matrix $\\Sigma_{\\text{fac}}$ that is guaranteed to be positive definite.\n\nSecond, the historical covariance matrix, $\\Sigma_{\\text{hist}}$, is specified differently in each test case. In Test Cases $1$ and $3$, it is defined as a perturbation of the factor model matrix:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\text{hist}} = \\Sigma_{\\text{fac}} + E\n$$\nwhere $E$ is a given symmetric matrix. For the optimization problem to be well-posed (specifically, to have a unique minimum), $\\Sigma_{\\text{hist}}$ must also be positive definite. This condition is not guaranteed a priori and depends on the perturbation $E$. A computational check of the eigenvalues of the resulting $\\Sigma_{\\text{hist}}$ matrices for Test Cases $1$ and $3$ confirms that all eigenvalues are positive, so the matrices are indeed positive definite. In Test Case $2$, $\\Sigma_{\\text{hist}} = \\Sigma_{\\text{fac}}$, so its positive definiteness is assured.\n\n**3. Numerical Optimization**\n\nThe QP problem is solved using a numerical solver. The `scipy.optimize.minimize` function with the Sequential Least Squares Programming (`SLSQP`) method is appropriate for this type of constrained optimization problem.\n\nFor each covariance matrix $\\Sigma \\in \\{\\Sigma_{\\text{hist}}, \\Sigma_{\\text{fac}}\\}$ and each target return $r_{\\text{tgt}}$, the solver is configured as follows:\n- **Objective function**: $f(w) = w^{\\top} \\Sigma w$.\n- **Equality constraints**:\n    1. $g_1(w) = w^{\\top} \\mu - r_{\\text{tgt}} = 0$\n    2. $g_2(w) = \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} w - 1 = 0$\n- **Bounds**: $w_i \\ge 0$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$. An initial guess, such as an equally weighted portfolio $w_0 = [1/n, \\dots, 1/n]^{\\top}$, provides a feasible starting point.\n\nThe optimization yields the optimal weight vector $w_{\\text{opt}}$, and the minimized objective function value is the portfolio variance, $\\sigma^2 = w_{\\text{opt}}^{\\top} \\Sigma w_{\\text{opt}}$. The standard deviation is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$.\n\n**4. Metric Calculation**\n\nThe analysis is performed over a grid of $5$ target returns, $T = \\{r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$. The grid is defined by the minimum and maximum expected returns of the individual assets:\n- $r_0 = \\min_{i} \\mu_i$\n- $r_4 = \\max_{i} \\mu_i$\n- The intermediate points are evenly spaced: $r_j = r_0 + \\frac{j}{4}(r_4 - r_0)$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nFor each $r \\in T$, we compute the optimal standard deviation for both covariance models, $\\sigma_{\\text{hist}}(r)$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{fac}}(r)$. The final summary metric for each test case, $\\Delta$, is the maximum absolute difference between these standard deviations over the entire grid:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\max_{r \\in T} \\left| \\sigma_{\\text{hist}}(r) - \\sigma_{\\text{fac}}(r) \\right|\n$$\nThe overall procedure is to iterate through each test case, construct the necessary matrices, solve the series of optimization problems for each point in the return grid $T$, and compute the final metric $\\Delta$. For Test Case $2$, since $\\Sigma_{\\text{hist}} = \\Sigma_{\\text{fac}}$, the optimization problems are identical, leading to $\\sigma_{\\text{hist}}(r) = \\sigma_{\\text{fac}}(r)$ for all $r$, and thus $\\Delta=0$ without requiring numerical computation.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the portfolio optimization problem for three test cases and\n    calculates the summary metric Delta for each.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Test Case 1 Data\n    case1 = {\n        'n': 4, 'k': 3,\n        'mu': np.array([0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.09]),\n        'B': np.array([\n            [1.2, 0.5, 0.3],\n            [0.8, 1.1, -0.2],\n            [1.5, -0.4, 0.7],\n            [0.6, 0.9, 0.4]\n        ]),\n        'Sigma_F': np.diag([0.04, 0.03, 0.02]),\n        'D': np.diag([0.02, 0.015, 0.018, 0.017]),\n        'E': np.array([\n            [0.001, -0.0003, 0.0002, -0.0001],\n            [-0.0003, 0.001, -0.00025, 0.00015],\n            [0.0002, -0.00025, 0.0012, -0.0002],\n            [-0.0001, 0.00015, -0.0002, 0.0008]\n        ])\n    }\n\n    # Test Case 2 Data\n    case2 = {\n        'n': 4, 'k': 3,\n        'mu': np.array([0.07, 0.075, 0.072, 0.074]),\n        'B': np.array([\n            [1.0, 0.2, 0.1],\n            [0.95, 0.25, 0.12],\n            [1.05, 0.18, 0.09],\n            [0.90, 0.30, 0.11]\n        ]),\n        'Sigma_F': np.diag([0.05, 0.025, 0.015]),\n        'D': np.diag([0.01, 0.012, 0.011, 0.013]),\n        'E': np.zeros((4, 4))  # Sigma_hist = Sigma_fac\n    }\n\n    # Test Case 3 Data\n    case3 = {\n        'n': 4, 'k': 3,\n        'mu': np.array([0.11, 0.09, 0.10, 0.115]),\n        'B': np.array([\n            [0.7, -0.2, 0.5],\n            [1.3, 0.4, -0.1],\n            [0.2, 1.1, 0.3],\n            [1.0, -0.3, 0.8]\n        ]),\n        'Sigma_F': np.diag([0.06, 0.02, 0.025]),\n        'D': np.diag([0.02, 0.018, 0.016, 0.017]),\n        'E': np.array([\n            [0.002, 0.0004, -0.0003, 0.0002],\n            [0.0004, 0.0025, 0.00035, -0.00025],\n            [-0.0003, 0.00035, 0.0022, 0.00015],\n            [0.0002, -0.00025, 0.00015, 0.0018]\n        ])\n    }\n\n    test_cases = [case1, case2, case3]\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        delta = compute_delta_for_case(case)\n        results.append(delta)\n    \n    # Format the final output string as required.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{d:.6f}' for d in results)}]\")\n\ndef run_optimization(Sigma, mu, r_tgt, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the quadratic programming problem for a given covariance matrix and target return.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Objective function: portfolio variance\n    def portfolio_variance(w, Sigma_arg):\n        return w.T @ Sigma_arg @ w\n\n    # Initial guess: equally weighted portfolio\n    w0 = np.ones(n) / n\n\n    # Constraints: sum of weights is 1, portfolio return is r_tgt\n    constraints = [\n        {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: np.sum(w) - 1.0},\n        {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: np.dot(w, mu) - r_tgt}\n    ]\n\n    # Bounds: weights are non-negative (no short selling)\n    bounds = tuple((0.0, None) for _ in range(n))\n\n    # Perform the optimization\n    result = minimize(\n        fun=portfolio_variance,\n        x0=w0,\n        args=(Sigma,),\n        method='SLSQP',\n        bounds=bounds,\n        constraints=constraints\n    )\n\n    if not result.success:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Optimization failed for r_tgt={r_tgt}: {result.message}\")\n        \n    return result.fun # This is the minimized variance\n\ndef compute_delta_for_case(case_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the summary metric Delta for a single test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    n, mu, B, Sigma_F, D, E = (\n        case_data['n'], case_data['mu'], case_data['B'],\n        case_data['Sigma_F'], case_data['D'], case_data['E']\n    )\n\n    # Construct covariance matrices\n    Sigma_fac = B @ Sigma_F @ B.T + D\n    Sigma_hist = Sigma_fac + E\n\n    # For Test Case 2, Sigma_hist == Sigma_fac, so Delta is 0.\n    if np.allclose(Sigma_hist, Sigma_fac):\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Define the target return grid\n    r_min = np.min(mu)\n    r_max = np.max(mu)\n    target_returns = np.linspace(r_min, r_max, 5)\n\n    max_diff = 0.0\n    for r_tgt in target_returns:\n        # Solve for historical covariance\n        var_hist = run_optimization(Sigma_hist, mu, r_tgt, n)\n        std_dev_hist = np.sqrt(var_hist)\n\n        # Solve for factor model covariance\n        var_fac = run_optimization(Sigma_fac, mu, r_tgt, n)\n        std_dev_fac = np.sqrt(var_fac)\n\n        # Update the maximum difference\n        diff = np.abs(std_dev_hist - std_dev_fac)\n        if diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = diff\n            \n    return max_diff\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2383628"}, {"introduction": "Knowing that our input parameters are uncertain, how can we make decisions that are resilient to estimation errors?

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe specified robust MVO problem is a minimax problem:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\sup_{\\Sigma \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\delta)} x^{\\top} \\Sigma x -\\mu^{\\top} x \\right)\n\\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} x = 1.\n$$\nTo solve this, we first analyze the inner maximization problem, which seeks the worst-case portfolio variance for a fixed portfolio $x$:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\Sigma \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\delta)} x^{\\top} \\Sigma x = \\sup_{\\Sigma} \\left\\{ x^{\\top} \\Sigma x \\mid \\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{S}_{+}^{3}, \\|\\Sigma - \\Sigma_{0}\\|_{F} \\le \\delta \\right\\}.\n$$\nWe can express the quadratic form $x^{\\top} \\Sigma x$ using the trace operator and the matrix inner product $\\langle A, B \\rangle_{F} = \\text{Tr}(A^{\\top}B)$. Since $x^{\\top}\\Sigma x$ is a scalar, $x^{\\top}\\Sigma x = \\text{Tr}(x^{\\top}\\Sigma x) = \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma x x^{\\top})$. As $\\Sigma$ and $xx^\\top$ are symmetric, this is equivalent to $\\langle \\Sigma, x x^{\\top} \\rangle_{F}$.\n\nLet $\\Delta = \\Sigma - \\Sigma_0$. The maximization problem over $\\Sigma$ can be rewritten as a maximization over the symmetric perturbation matrix $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\Delta} \\left\\{ x^{\\top}(\\Sigma_0 + \\Delta)x \\mid \\|\\Delta\\|_{F} \\le \\delta, \\Sigma_0+\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{S}_{+}^{3}, \\Delta \\in \\mathbb{S}^{3} \\right\\},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$ is the set of $3 \\times 3$ symmetric matrices.\nThe objective function is $x^{\\top}\\Sigma_0 x + x^{\\top}\\Delta x = x^{\\top}\\Sigma_0 x + \\langle \\Delta, x x^{\\top} \\rangle_{F}$. The term $x^{\\top}\\Sigma_0 x$ is constant with respect to $\\Delta$, so we must solve:\n$$\nx^{\\top}\\Sigma_0 x + \\sup_{\\Delta} \\left\\{ \\langle \\Delta, x x^{\\top} \\rangle_{F} \\mid \\|\\Delta\\|_{F} \\le \\delta, \\Sigma_0+\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{S}_{+}^{3}, \\Delta \\in \\mathbb{S}^{3} \\right\\}.\n$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the Frobenius inner product, the supremum of $\\langle \\Delta, x x^{\\top} \\rangle_{F}$ subject to $\\|\\Delta\\|_{F} \\le \\delta$ is attained when $\\Delta$ is aligned with the matrix $xx^{\\top}$. The optimal perturbation is $\\Delta^{\\star} = \\delta \\frac{x x^{\\top}}{\\|x x^{\\top}\\|_{F}}$.\nThe Frobenius norm of the rank-1 matrix $x x^{\\top}$ is:\n$$\n\\|x x^{\\top}\\|_{F} = \\sqrt{\\text{Tr}\\left((x x^{\\top})^{\\top}(x x^{\\top})\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\text{Tr}\\left(x x^{\\top} x x^{\\top}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\text{Tr}\\left(x(x^{\\top}x)x^{\\top}\\right)} = \\sqrt{(x^{\\top}x)\\text{Tr}(x x^{\\top})} = \\sqrt{\\|x\\|_{2}^2 \\|x\\|_{2}^2} = \\|x\\|_{2}^2,\n$$\nwhere $\\|x\\|_2$ is the Euclidean norm of $x$.\nThe optimal perturbation is therefore $\\Delta^{\\star} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\|x\\|_{2}^2} x x^{\\top}$. The corresponding worst-case covariance matrix is $\\Sigma^{\\star} = \\Sigma_0 + \\frac{\\delta}{\\|x\\|_{2}^2} x x^{\\top}$. Since $\\Sigma_0$ is positive semidefinite and $xx^{\\top}$ is positive semidefinite, their weighted sum (with non-negative weights) ensures $\\Sigma^\\star \\in \\mathbb{S}_{+}^{3}$. Thus, the positive semidefiniteness constraint on $\\Sigma$ is automatically satisfied by the solution of the relaxed problem and can be ignored.\n\nThe maximum value of the inner product term is $\\langle \\Delta^{\\star}, x x^{\\top} \\rangle_{F} = \\delta \\|x x^{\\top}\\|_{F} = \\delta \\|x\\|_{2}^2$.\nThe worst-case variance is:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\Sigma \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\delta)} x^{\\top} \\Sigma x = x^{\\top}\\Sigma_0 x + \\delta \\|x\\|_{2}^2.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the MVO problem, we obtain an equivalent standard quadratic program:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}} \\;\\; \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\left( x^{\\top}\\Sigma_0 x + \\delta \\|x\\|_{2}^2 \\right) - \\mu^{\\top} x\n\\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} x = 1.\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\|x\\|_{2}^2 = x^{\\top}Ix$, where $I$ is the identity matrix, the objective function can be rewritten as:\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} x^{\\top}(\\Sigma_0 + \\delta I)x - \\mu^{\\top} x.\n$$\nLet us define the robust covariance matrix $\\tilde{\\Sigma} = \\Sigma_0 + \\delta I$. The problem is now a standard MVO problem:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}} \\;\\; \\frac{\\gamma}{2} x^{\\top}\\tilde{\\Sigma}x - \\mu^{\\top} x\n\\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} x = 1.\n$$\nThis is a convex optimization problem with a linear equality constraint, which we solve using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x, \\lambda) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} x^{\\top}\\tilde{\\Sigma}x - \\mu^{\\top} x + \\lambda(1 - \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} x).\n$$\nThe first-order necessary conditions for optimality are obtained by setting the gradients to zero:\n$$\n\\nabla_x \\mathcal{L} = \\gamma \\tilde{\\Sigma}x - \\mu - \\lambda\\mathbf{1} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla_\\lambda \\mathcal{L} = 1 - \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} x = 0\n$$\nFrom the first equation, we solve for $x$. Since $\\Sigma_0$ is positive definite and $\\delta \\ge 0$, $\\tilde{\\Sigma}$ is also positive definite and therefore invertible.\n$$\n\\gamma \\tilde{\\Sigma}x = \\mu + \\lambda\\mathbf{1} \\implies x = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\tilde{\\Sigma}^{-1} (\\mu + \\lambda\\mathbf{1}).\n$$\nWe substitute this expression for $x$ into the budget constraint $\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}x = 1$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}^{\\top} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\tilde{\\Sigma}^{-1} (\\mu + \\lambda\\mathbf{1}) \\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\tilde{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mu + \\lambda(\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\tilde{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mathbf{1}) = \\gamma.\n$$\nTo find $\\lambda$, we define the scalars:\n$$\nA = \\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\tilde{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mathbf{1}, \\quad B = \\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\tilde{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\mu.\n$$\nThe equation for $\\lambda$ becomes $B + \\lambda A = \\gamma$, which gives:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\gamma - B}{A}.\n$$\nThe unique optimal portfolio $x^{\\star}$ is found by first computing $\\lambda$ and then substituting it back into the expression for $x$.\n\n**Algorithm**\nFor each test case with parameters $(\\gamma, \\delta)$:\n1.
