The concepts of nameplate capacity, capacity factor, and annual degradation are standard metrics in the field of power systems engineering and renewable energy finance. The given values are realistic; a capacity factor of $0.25$ is typical for solar PV in many regions, and an annual degradation rate of $0.5\\%$ is a standard assumption for modern crystalline silicon modules. The problem is well-posed, describing an infinite geometric series with a common ratio whose magnitude is less than one, which guarantees convergence to a unique, finite sum. The language is objective and precise. The use of a perpetuity model is an idealization, but it is explicitly stated as a modeling assumption and is a valid mathematical technique for approximating long-term cumulative effects. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total energy produced over an infinite time horizon by a solar facility subject to a constant proportional degradation. This is equivalent to finding the sum of an infinite geometric series.\n\nFirst, let us determine the energy produced in the first year of operation, which we denote as $E_1$. The energy output is the product of the average power and the duration of operation. The average power is the nameplate capacity multiplied by the capacity factor.\n\nLet $C$ be the nameplate capacity, $f$ be the capacity factor, and $T$ be the number of hours in a year.\nThe energy produced in the first year is given by:\n$$E_1 = C \\times f \\times T$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$C = 100 \\text{ MW}$$\n$$f = 0.25$$\n$$T = 8760 \\text{ h}$$\nSo,\n$$E_1 = 100 \\text{ MW} \\times 0.25 \\times 8760 \\text{ h} = 25 \\text{ MW} \\times 8760 \\text{ h} = 219000 \\text{ MWh}$$\n\nThe problem states that the energy output experiences a constant proportional degradation of $d = 0.5\\%$ per year. This means the energy produced in any given year is a constant fraction of the energy produced in the preceding year. Let this constant multiplicative factor be $r$.\n$$d = 0.5\\% = 0.005$$\nThe factor $r$ is:\n$$r = 1 - d = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$$\n\nThe stream of annual energy production forms a geometric sequence:\n- Year 1: $E_1 = 219000 \\text{ MWh}$\n- Year 2: $E_2 = E_1 \\times r$\n- Year 3: $E_3 = E_2 \\times r = E_1 \\times r^2$\n- Year $n$: $E_n = E_1 \\times r^{n-1}$\n\nThe total cumulative energy produced over all future years, $E_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of this infinite geometric series:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_1 \\times r^{n-1}$$\nThe formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:\n$$S = \\frac{a}{1-r}$$\nwhere $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. This formula is valid only if $|r| < 1$. In this problem, the first term is $a = E_1$ and the common ratio is $r = 0.995$. Since $|0.995| < 1$, the series converges, and we can apply the formula.\n\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{E_1}{1-r}$$\nSubstituting the values for $E_1$ and $r$:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{219000}{1 - 0.995} = \\frac{219000}{0.005}$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 219000 \\times \\frac{1}{0.005} = 219000 \\times 200$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 43800000 \\text{ MWh}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $43,800,000$. The four most significant figures are $4$, $3$, $8$, and $0$. To express this in standard scientific notation with four significant figures, we write:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 4.380 \\times 10^7$$\nThis is the total cumulative energy produced by the facility over its infinite operational life under the specified degradation model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.380 \\times 10^7}$$", "id": "2371754"}, {"introduction": "Moving from deterministic models to the more realistic world of uncertainty is a critical step in financial analysis.
