It is a standard problem in computational finance.\n\nFirst, we determine the cash flows for the portfolio. The portfolio consists of one unit of Project A and one unit of Project B. The cash flow for the portfolio at time $t$, denoted $C^{P}_{t}$, is the sum of the cash flows of the individual projects, $C^{P}_{t} = C^{A}_{t} + C^{B}_{t}$.\n\nThe given cash flows are:\nFor Project A: $C^{A}_{0}=-100$, $C^{A}_{1}=+60$, $C^{A}_{2}=+60$.\nFor Project B: $C^{B}_{0}=-100$, $C^{B}_{1}=+0$, $C^{B}_{2}=+130$.\n\nThe resulting portfolio cash flows are:\n$C^{P}_{0} = C^{A}_{0} + C^{B}_{0} = -100 + (-100) = -200$.\n$C^{P}_{1} = C^{A}_{1} + C^{B}_{1} = 60 + 0 = 60$.\n$C^{P}_{2} = C^{A}_{2} + C^{B}_{2} = 60 + 130 = 190$.\n\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of the portfolio, which we shall denote as $r_{P}$, is the discount rate for which the net present value (NPV) of the portfolio's cash flows is zero. The NPV of the portfolio is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\text{NPV}_{P}(r) = \\sum_{t=0}^{2} \\frac{C^{P}_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}} = C^{P}_{0} + \\frac{C^{P}_{1}}{1+r} + \\frac{C^{P}_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}}\n$$\nSetting $\\text{NPV}_{P}(r_{P}) = 0$:\n$$\n-200 + \\frac{60}{1+r_{P}} + \\frac{190}{(1+r_{P})^{2}} = 0\n$$\nTo solve this equation for $r_{P}$, let us introduce the substitution $x = \\frac{1}{1+r_{P}}$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $x$:\n$$\n190x^{2} + 60x - 200 = 0\n$$\nDividing by $10$ simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n19x^{2} + 6x - 20 = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^{2} - 4(19)(-20)}}{2(19)} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 1520}}{38} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{1556}}{38}\n$$\nSince $r_{P}$ represents an interest rate for a conventional investment, we expect $1+r_{P}  0$, which implies $x = \\frac{1}{1+r_{P}}$ must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive root:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-6 + \\sqrt{1556}}{38} = \\frac{-6 + 2\\sqrt{389}}{38} = \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{389}}{19}\n$$\nUsing a numerical approximation, $\\sqrt{389} \\approx 19.72308$, we find:\n$$\nx \\approx \\frac{-3 + 19.72308}{19} = \\frac{16.72308}{19} \\approx 0.880162\n$$\nNow we solve for $r_{P}$ from the substitution $x = \\frac{1}{1+r_{P}}$:\n$$\n1+r_{P} = \\frac{1}{x} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.880162} \\approx 1.136154\n$$\n$$\nr_{P} \\approx 1.136154 - 1 = 0.136154\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the portfolio IRR is $0.1362$.\n\nNext, we must justify why the portfolio IRR is not a simple weighted average of the individual project IRRs. Let $r_{A}$ and $r_{B}$ be the IRRs for Project A and Project B, respectively. They are defined by the roots of their respective NPV equations:\n$$\n\\text{NPV}_{A}(r_{A}) = \\sum_{t=0}^{2} \\frac{C^{A}_{t}}{(1+r_{A})^{t}} = -100 + \\frac{60}{1+r_{A}} + \\frac{60}{(1+r_{A})^{2}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\text{NPV}_{B}(r_{B}) = \\sum_{t=0}^{2} \\frac{C^{B}_{t}}{(1+r_{B})^{t}} = -100 + \\frac{0}{1+r_{B}} + \\frac{130}{(1+r_{B})^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThe portfolio IRR, $r_{P}$, is defined by the root of the portfolio's NPV equation:\n$$\n\\text{NPV}_{P}(r_{P}) = \\sum_{t=0}^{2} \\frac{C^{P}_{t}}{(1+r_{P})^{t}} = \\sum_{t=0}^{2} \\frac{C^{A}_{t} + C^{B}_{t}}{(1+r_{P})^{t}} = 0\n$$\nBy the additivity of summation, this can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum_{t=0}^{2} \\frac{C^{A}_{t}}{(1+r_{P})^{t}} + \\sum_{t=0}^{2} \\frac{C^{B}_{t}}{(1+r_{P})^{t}} = 0\n$$\nThis is equivalent to stating that $\\text{NPV}_{A}(r_{P}) + \\text{NPV}_{B}(r_{P}) = 0$.\n\nA weighted average of the individual IRRs, with weights $w_{A}$ and $w_{B}$ proportional to initial investments $|C^{A}_{0}|=100$ and $|C^{B}_{0}|=100$, would be $r_{\\text{avg}} = w_{A}r_{A} + w_{B}r_{B}$. Since the initial investments are equal, the weights are $w_A=w_B=0.5$, and the average is $r_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{r_{A}+r_{B}}{2}$.\n\nThe assertion that $r_{P} = r_{\\text{avg}}$ is incorrect. The fundamental reason lies in the non-linearity of the NPV function with respect to the discount rate $r$. The IRR is a root of the equation $\\text{NPV}(r)=0$. The root of a sum of two non-linear functions, $\\text{NPV}_{A}(r) + \\text{NPV}_{B}(r) = 0$, is not, in general, a simple average of the roots of the individual functions, $\\text{NPV}_{A}(r_{A})=0$ and $\\text{NPV}_{B}(r_{B})=0$.\n\nTo be precise, the relationship between NPV and $r$ involves terms of the form $(1+r)^{-t}$, which are non-linear functions of $r$. For a property like a weighted average to hold for the roots, the function would need to be linear in the variable. For example, if $\\text{NPV}(r)$ were a linear function of $r$, say $\\text{NPV}_{i}(r) = k_{i}(r_{i}-r)$, then $\\text{NPV}_{P}(r) = k_{A}(r_{A}-r) + k_{B}(r_{B}-r)$. Setting this to zero would yield $r_{P} = \\frac{k_{A}}{k_{A}+k_{B}}r_{A} + \\frac{k_{B}}{k_{A}+k_{B}}r_{B}$, a weighted average. However, the NPV function is patently not linear in $r$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\text{NPV}_{A}(r_{P}) + \\text{NPV}_{B}(r_{P}) = 0$ must be solved directly for $r_{P}$ and its solution cannot be assumed to be a linear combination of $r_{A}$ and $r_{B}$. The operation of finding a root does not commute with addition in this way for non-linear functions. This constitutes a formal refutation of the idea that portfolio IRR is a simple weighted average of component IRRs.\n\nThe computed portfolio IRR is $r_{P} \\approx 0.136154$. For completeness, the individual IRRs are $r_{A} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{69}-3}-1 \\approx 0.1307$ and $r_{B} = \\sqrt{1.3}-1 \\approx 0.1402$. The weighted average is $r_{\\text{avg}} \\approx \\frac{0.1307+0.1402}{2} \\approx 0.1355$. As demonstrated by both the formal argument and the explicit calculation, $r_{P} \\neq r_{\\text{avg}}$.\nThe final answer is the portfolio IRR rounded to four significant figures.\n$r_{P} \\approx 0.1362$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1362}$$", "id": "2403026"}, {"introduction": "Bridging the gap between financial theory and practical application, this exercise challenges you to build a computational tool.

Let $S$ be the set of time indices for which the cash flows are known. The set of all time indices is $\\{0, 1, \\dots, T\\}$.
