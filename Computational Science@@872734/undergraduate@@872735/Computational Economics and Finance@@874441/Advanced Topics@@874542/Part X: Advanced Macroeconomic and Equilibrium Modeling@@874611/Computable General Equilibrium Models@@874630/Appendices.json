We use these accounting identities to determine the unknown transfer from Government to Households, denoted by $x$.\n\nFirst, consider the Activities account. Its receipts are from Households consumption, Government consumption, Investment demand, and Exports. Its expenditures are Value Added to Factors, Indirect Taxes to Government, and Imports to Rest of World. Let Value Added be denoted by $VA$. The Activities account balance gives\n$$\n100 + 30 + 50 + 40 \\;=\\; VA + 10 + 60.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n220 \\;=\\; VA + 70 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; VA \\;=\\; 150.\n$$\n\nNext, consider the Factors account. Its only receipt is $VA$ from Activities, and its expenditures are Factor income to Households and repatriated factor income to Rest of World. Let the factor income to Households be $Y_{FH}$. Given repatriated factor income equals $0$, the Factors account balance gives\n$$\nVA \\;=\\; Y_{FH} + 0 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; Y_{FH} \\;=\\; 150.\n$$\n\nNow consider the Households account. Its receipts are factor income from Factors, $Y_{FH}$, and transfers from Government, $x$. Its expenditures are consumption to Activities, direct taxes to Government, and household saving to Savings–Investment. The Households account balance implies\n$$\nY_{FH} + x \\;=\\; 100 + 50 + 20.\n$$\nSubstituting $Y_{FH} = 150$,\n$$\n150 + x \\;=\\; 170 \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; x \\;=\\; 20.\n$$\n\nWe can cross-check using the Government account. Government receipts are indirect taxes from Activities and direct taxes from Households, and Government expenditures are government consumption to Activities, transfers to Households, and government saving. The Government account balance implies\n$$\n10 + 50 \\;=\\; 30 + x + 10.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n60 \\;=\\; 40 + x \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; x \\;=\\; 20,\n$$\nwhich is consistent with the value obtained from the Households account.\n\nFor completeness, verify external and savings balances. The Rest of World account has receipts equal to imports plus repatriated factor income, and expenditures equal to exports plus foreign saving, denoted $FS$. The Rest of World balance is\n$$\n60 + 0 \\;=\\; 40 + FS \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; FS \\;=\\; 20.\n$$\nThe Savings–Investment account receives household saving, government saving, and foreign saving, and spends on investment demand:\n$$\n20 + 10 + 20 \\;=\\; 50,\n$$\nwhich holds.

This practice explores the famous \"rebound effect\" by modeling a household's reaction to an energy efficiency improvement, where savings from increased efficiency are partially offset by increased consumption due to a lower effective price of energy services. By deriving the household's demand from a Stone-Geary utility function, you will see firsthand how behavioral parameters determine the magnitude of this policy-relevant phenomenon.", "problem": "Consider a static, two-good, small open economy represented by a single household as typically embedded as a demand block within a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The goods are an energy service $S$ and a composite numeraire $X$. The household has income $m$ and faces the energy commodity price $p_E$ and a normalized price $1$ for $X$. The energy service is produced by the household using purchased energy $E$ at fixed efficiency $ \\eta $, so that $ S = \\eta E $. The effective price of the service is therefore $ p_S = p_E / \\eta $, since purchasing $E$ units of energy at price $p_E$ yields $S = \\eta E$ units of service.\n\nPreferences are represented by a Stone–Geary utility function:\n$$\nU(S, X) = (S - \\bar{s})^{\\alpha} (X - \\bar{x})^{1 - \\alpha},\n$$\nwith $ \\alpha \\in (0, 1) $, subsistence parameters $ \\bar{s} \\ge 0 $, $ \\bar{x} \\ge 0 $, and budget constraint\n$$\np_E E + X = m,\n$$\nequivalently expressed in service units as\n$$\np_S S + X = m, \\quad \\text{where } p_S = \\frac{p_E}{\\eta}.\n$$\nAssume interior solutions with $ S \\ge \\bar{s} $, $ X \\ge \\bar{x} $, and $ m > p_S \\bar{s} + \\bar{x} $ for all price–efficiency combinations considered.\n\nAn energy efficiency improvement is a move from baseline efficiency $ \\eta_0 $ to improved efficiency $ \\eta_1 $ with $ \\eta_1 > \\eta_0 $, holding $ p_E $ and $ m $ fixed. Define:\n- Baseline equilibrium: $ (S_0, X_0, E_0) $ solves the household problem at $(p_E, \\eta_0)$.\n- Post-improvement equilibrium: $ (S_1, X_1, E_1) $ solves the household problem at $(p_E, \\eta_1)$.\n- Engineering counterfactual energy use that holds baseline service fixed at the new efficiency: $ E_{\\text{eng}} = \\dfrac{S_0}{\\eta_1} $.\n- Actual energy savings: $ \\Delta E_{\\text{act}} = E_0 - E_1 $.\n- Engineering (maximum) energy savings: $ \\Delta E_{\\text{eng}} = E_0 - E_{\\text{eng}} $.\n- Rebound effect (decimal, not a percentage): \n$$\nR = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{act}}}{\\Delta E_{\\text{eng}}}.\n$$\n\nTask:\n1. Starting from the fundamental definitions of utility maximization subject to a budget constraint, derive the household’s optimal demands for $ S $ and $ X $ in terms of $ \\alpha $, $ \\bar{s} $, $ \\bar{x} $, $ m $, and $ p_S $. Use these demands to compute $ E_0 $, $ E_1 $, $ E_{\\text{eng}} $, and finally the rebound $ R $ as defined above.\n2.

It is scientifically grounded, objective, and internally consistent. One must note that the general assumption of strictly positive supernumerary income, $m > p_S \\bar{s} + \\bar{x}$, is deliberately violated in Test Case C to examine a boundary condition where $m = p_{S0} \\bar{s} + \\bar{x}$. This does not invalidate the problem, as the model remains well-defined at this boundary. We proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe household's problem is to maximize the Stone–Geary utility function $U(S, X) = (S - \\bar{s})^{\\alpha} (X - \\bar{x})^{1 - \\alpha}$ subject to the budget constraint $p_S S + X = m$. The parameters $\\bar{s}$ and $\\bar{x}$ are interpreted as subsistence or committed quantities. The household first allocates income to acquire these subsistence quantities, at a cost of $p_S \\bar{s} + \\bar{x}$. The remaining income, known as supernumerary income $m'$, is then allocated to maximize utility.\n$$\nm' = m - (p_S \\bar{s} + \\bar{x})\n$$\nThe optimization problem can be reformulated by defining supernumerary quantities $S' = S - \\bar{s}$ and $X' = X - \\bar{x}$. The problem becomes maximizing a Cobb-Douglas utility function $U(S', X') = (S')^{\\alpha} (X')^{1 - \\alpha}$ subject to the supernumerary budget constraint $p_S S' + X' = m'$.\n\nFor a Cobb-Douglas utility function, the expenditure on each good is a constant share of income, equal to the utility exponent.\nExpenditure on service $S'$: $p_S S' = \\alpha m'$.\nExpenditure on numeraire $X'$: $X' = (1 - \\alpha) m'$.\n\nSubstituting back the original variables and the expression for $m'$:\n$$\np_S (S - \\bar{s}) = \\alpha (m - p_S \\bar{s} - \\bar{x})\n$$\nSolving this for the Marshallian demand for the energy service $S$:\n$$\np_S S - p_S \\bar{s} = \\alpha m - \\alpha p_S \\bar{s} - \\alpha \\bar{x}\n$$\n$$\np_S S = (1 - \\alpha) p_S \\bar{s} + \\alpha(m - \\bar{x})\n$$\n$$\nS(m, p_S) = (1 - \\alpha)\\bar{s} + \\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})}{p_S}\n$$\nThis is the optimal demand for the energy service $S$ as a function of income $m$ and the service price $p_S$.\n\nNow, we derive the rebound effect, $R$. The efficiency improvement changes the service price from $p_{S0} = p_E / \\eta_0$ to $p_{S1} = p_E / \\eta_1$. The rebound effect is defined as:\n$$\nR = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{act}}}{\\Delta E_{\\text{eng}}} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{eng}} - \\Delta E_{\\text{act}}}{\\Delta E_{\\text{eng}}}\n$$\nThe components are:\n- Actual savings: $\\Delta E_{\\text{act}} = E_0 - E_1 = \\frac{S_0}{\\eta_0} - \\frac{S_1}{\\eta_1}$.\n- Engineering savings: $\\Delta E_{\\text{eng}} = E_0 - E_{\\text{eng}} = \\frac{S_0}{\\eta_0} - \\frac{S_0}{\\eta_1} = S_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta_0} - \\frac{1}{\\eta_1}\\right)$.\n- The numerator of $R$ is $\\Delta E_{\\text{eng}} - \\Delta E_{\\text{act}} = \\left(\\frac{S_0}{\\eta_0} - \\frac{S_0}{\\eta_1}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{S_0}{\\eta_0} - \\frac{S_1}{\\eta_1}\\right) = \\frac{S_1 - S_0}{\\eta_1}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(S_1 - S_0) / \\eta_1}{S_0 (1/\\eta_0 - 1/\\eta_1)}\n$$\nThe change in service demand, $S_1 - S_0$, is found using the demand function:\n$$\nS_1 - S_0 = \\left((1 - \\alpha)\\bar{s} + \\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})}{p_{S1}}\\right) - \\left((1 - \\alpha)\\bar{s} + \\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})}{p_{S0}}\\right) = \\alpha(m - \\bar{x})\\left(\\frac{1}{p_{S1}} - \\frac{1}{p_{S0}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $p_S = p_E / \\eta$:\n$$\nS_1 - S_0 = \\alpha(m - \\bar{x})\\left(\\frac{\\eta_1}{p_E} - \\frac{\\eta_0}{p_E}\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})(\\eta_1 - \\eta_0)}{p_E}\n$$\nThe denominator of $R$ contains the term $S_0 (1/\\eta_0 - 1/\\eta_1) = S_0 \\frac{\\eta_1 - \\eta_0}{\\eta_0 \\eta_1}$.\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})(\\eta_1 - \\eta_0)}{p_E \\eta_1}}{S_0 \\frac{\\eta_1 - \\eta_0}{\\eta_0 \\eta_1}} = \\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})\\eta_0}{p_E S_0}\n$$\nThe term $p_E/\\eta_0$ is the baseline service price, $p_{S0}$. Thus, $R = \\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})}{p_{S0} S_0}$. The denominator, $p_{S0}S_0$, is the total baseline expenditure on the energy service. From the demand function:\n$$\np_{S0}S_0 = p_{S0}\\left((1 - \\alpha)\\bar{s} + \\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})}{p_{S0}}\\right) = (1 - \\alpha)p_{S0}\\bar{s} + \\alpha(m - \\bar{x})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $R$ yields the final, compact formula:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\alpha(m - \\bar{x})}{(1 - \\alpha)p_{S0}\\bar{s} + \\alpha(m - \\bar{x})}\n$$\nwhere $p_{S0} = p_E/\\eta_0$. This formula depends only on initial-state parameters.\n- For the Cobb-Douglas case ($\\bar{s}=0, \\bar{x}=0$), the formula correctly simplifies to $R=1$, indicating full rebound.\n- For the case of zero baseline supernumerary income ($m - \\bar{x} = p_{S0}\\bar{s}$), the formula simplifies to $R = \\alpha$.\n\nWe now apply this formula to the provided test cases.\n\n- **Test A**: $(\\alpha, \\bar{s}, \\bar{x}, m, p_E, \\eta_0) = (0.3, 5, 10, 200, 2, 1.0)$\n  $p_{S0} = 2 / 1.0 = 2$.\n  $R_A = \\frac{0.3(200 - 10)}{(1 - 0.3)(2)(5) + 0.3(200 - 10)} = \\frac{0.3(190)}{0.7(10) + 0.3(190)} = \\frac{57}{7 + 57} = \\frac{57}{64} = 0.890625$.\n\n- **Test B**: $(\\alpha, \\bar{s}, \\bar{x}, m, p_E, \\eta_0) = (0.05, 20, 20, 200, 2, 1.0)$\n  $p_{S0} = 2 / 1.0 = 2$.\n  $R_B = \\frac{0.05(200 - 20)}{(1 - 0.05)(2)(20) + 0.05(200 - 20)} = \\frac{0.05(180)}{0.95(40) + 0.05(180)} = \\frac{9}{38 + 9} = \\frac{9}{47} \\approx 0.191489$.\n\n- **Test C**: $(\\alpha, \\bar{s}, \\bar{x}, m, p_E, \\eta_0) = (0.5, 40, 40, 120, 2, 1.0)$\n  $p_{S0} = 2 / 1.0 = 2$.

Before proceeding to a solution, a rigorous validation of the problem statement is mandatory.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe following data and definitions are provided for a series of test cases:\n- Proportional change in ad valorem import tariff rate: $\\Delta \\tau$\n- Proportional change in import volume: $\\Delta M$\n- Proportional change in the relative price of the import composite to the domestically produced good: $\\Delta P_{M/D}$\n- Proportional change in export volume: $\\Delta X$\n- Proportional change in the relative price of exports to the domestically produced good: $\\Delta P_{X/D}$\n- Proportional change in the real wage: $\\Delta w$\n- Proportional change in aggregate employment: $\\Delta N$\n- Proportional change in government savings: $\\Delta S_G$\n\nTwo binary closure rule codes are defined:\n- Labor market closure code $c_L$: $c_L=0$ if $\\Delta w = 0$ and $\\Delta N \\neq 0$; $c_L=1$ if $\\Delta N = 0$ and $\\Delta w \\neq 0$.\n- Government closure code $c_G$: $c_G=0$ if $\\Delta S_G = 0$; $c_G=1$ if $\\Delta S_G \\neq 0$.\n\nTwo elasticity parameters are to be inferred:\n- Armington import substitution elasticity $\\sigma_A$, linking $\\Delta M$ to $\\Delta P_{M/D}$.\n- CET export transformation elasticity $\\phi$, linking $\\Delta X$ to $\\Delta P_{X/D}$.\n\nTest Suite Data $(\\Delta \\tau, \\Delta M, \\Delta P_{M/D}, \\Delta X, \\Delta P_{X/D}, \\Delta w, \\Delta N, \\Delta S_G)$:\n- Case 1: $(0.04, -0.06, 0.04, 0.03, 0.025, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0)$\n- Case 2: $(-0.05, 0.04, -0.05, -0.01, -0.02, -0.005, 0.0, 0.012)$\n- Case 3: $(0.01, -0.02, 0.01, 0.03, 0.03, 0.0, 0.005, 0.0)$\n\nThe required output for each case is a list: $[c_L, c_G, \\sigma_A, \\phi]$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is examined against the criteria for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is rooted in standard, well-established concepts of computational economics. Armington substitution, Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET), and macroeconomic closure rules are canonical elements of CGE models. The fundamental definition of elasticity as a ratio of proportional changes is a cornerstone of economic analysis. The data provided are consistent with basic economic theory; for instance, an increase in the relative price of imports corresponds to a decrease in import volume. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. The definitions for the closure codes are unambiguous. The instruction to infer elasticities \"using the fundamental definition of elasticity as a ratio of proportional changes\" provides a direct method of calculation from the given data. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution for each case.\n- **Objective**: The problem is expressed in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjectivity or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The data provided for each test case is sufficient to determine the four required outputs. There are no contradictions. For example, the directions of the initial shock ($\\Delta \\tau$) and the resulting price change ($\\Delta P_{M/D}$) are consistent in all cases. The conditions for the closure codes are mutually exclusive and cover all scenarios presented in the data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded exercise in applying fundamental economic definitions. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe task is to determine two closure parameters, $c_L$ and $c_G$, and two elasticity parameters, $\\sigma_A$ and $\\phi$, for each case. The methodology is based directly on the definitions provided.\n\n**Methodology**\n\n1.  **Labor Market Closure ($c_L$)**: The code $c_L$ is determined by inspecting the proportional changes in the real wage ($\\Delta w$) and aggregate employment ($\\Delta N$).\n    - If the real wage is fixed ($\\Delta w = 0$) and employment adjusts ($\\Delta N \\neq 0$), the closure is Keynesian, and $c_L = 0$.\n    - If employment is fixed ($\\Delta N = 0$) and the real wage adjusts ($\\Delta w \\neq 0$), the closure is neoclassical (full employment), and $c_L = 1$.\n\n2.  **Government Closure ($c_G$)**: The code $c_G$ is determined by inspecting the proportional change in government savings ($\\Delta S_G$).\n    - If government savings is fixed ($\\Delta S_G = 0$), implying some tax rate or transfer payment adjusts to balance the government budget, then $c_G = 0$.\n    - If government savings is flexible ($\\Delta S_G \\neq 0$), implying tax rates are fixed and the budget balance absorbs fiscal shocks, then $c_G = 1$.\n\n3.  **Armington Elasticity ($\\sigma_A$)**: The Armington elasticity of substitution, $\\sigma_A$, measures the consumer's willingness to substitute between imported goods and domestically produced goods. It is defined as the negative of the ratio of the proportional change in the quantity of imports to the proportional change in their relative price. A positive value is expected.\n    $$ \\sigma_A = - \\frac{\\Delta M}{\\Delta P_{M/D}} $$\n    The negative sign reflects the law of demand: as the relative price of imports increases, the quantity demanded decreases.\n\n4.  **CET Elasticity ($\\phi$)**: The elasticity of transformation, $\\phi$, measures the producer's ability to shift production between goods for the export market and goods for the domestic market. It is defined as the ratio of the proportional change in the quantity of exports to the proportional change in their relative price. A positive value is expected.\n    $$ \\phi = \\frac{\\Delta X}{\\Delta P_{X/D}} $$\n    The positive relationship indicates that as the relative price of exports rises, producers are incentivized to supply more to the export market.\n\n**Application to Test Cases**\n\n**Case 1:**\n- Data: $(\\Delta \\tau, \\Delta M, \\Delta P_{M/D}, \\Delta X, \\Delta P_{X/D}, \\Delta w, \\Delta N, \\Delta S_G) = (0.04, -0.06, 0.04, 0.03, 0.025, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0)$\n- $c_L$: We observe $\\Delta w = 0.0$ and $\\Delta N = 0.01 \\neq 0$. This corresponds to a fixed real wage with flexible employment. Therefore, $c_L = 0$.\n- $c_G$: We observe $\\Delta S_G = 0.0$. This corresponds to fixed government savings. Therefore, $c_G = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_A$: Using the formula, $\\sigma_A = - \\frac{-0.06}{0.04} = 1.5$.\n- $\\phi$: Using the formula, $\\phi = \\frac{0.03}{0.025} = 1.2$.\n- Result: $[0, 0, 1.5, 1.2]$\n\n**Case 2:**\n- Data: $(\\Delta \\tau, \\Delta M, \\Delta P_{M/D}, \\Delta X, \\Delta P_{X/D}, \\Delta w, \\Delta N, \\Delta S_G) = (-0.05, 0.04, -0.05, -0.01, -0.02, -0.005, 0.0, 0.012)$\n- $c_L$: We observe $\\Delta w = -0.005 \\neq 0$ and $\\Delta N = 0.0$. This corresponds to full employment with a flexible real wage. Therefore, $c_L = 1$.\n- $c_G$: We observe $\\Delta S_G = 0.012 \\neq 0$. This corresponds to adjusting government savings.

This corresponds to a fixed real wage with flexible employment. Therefore, $c_L = 0$.\n- $c_G$: We observe $\\Delta S_G = 0.0$. This corresponds to fixed government savings. Therefore, $c_G = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_A$: Using the formula, $\\sigma_A = - \\frac{-0.02}{0.01} = 2.0$.\n- $\\phi$: Using the formula, $\\phi = \\frac{0.03}{0.03} = 1.0$.\n- Result: $[0, 0, 2.0, 1.0]$\n\nThe analysis is complete.
