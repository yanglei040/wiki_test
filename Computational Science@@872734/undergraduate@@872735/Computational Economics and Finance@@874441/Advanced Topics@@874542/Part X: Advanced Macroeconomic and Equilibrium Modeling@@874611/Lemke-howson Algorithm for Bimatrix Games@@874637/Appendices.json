We may proceed with the solution.\n\nA mixed strategy profile $(x, y)$, where $x \\in \\Delta_m$ and $y \\in \\Delta_n$, is a Nash Equilibrium (NE) of a bimatrix game with payoff matrices $(A, B)$ if each player's strategy is a best response to the other's.\n\nFor player 1 (row player), the strategy $x$ is a best response to $y$ if it maximizes the expected payoff $x'^\\top A y$ over all $x' \\in \\Delta_m$. This is equivalent to stating that any pure strategy $i$ played with positive probability ($x_i  0$) must yield the maximum possible expected payoff against $y$. Let $u$ be the expected payoff for player 1, $u = x^\\top A y$. The best response condition for player 1 is:\n$$ (A y)_i \\le u \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\} $$\nwith the additional property that if $x_i  0$, then $(A y)_i = u$. This can be summarized by the complementary slackness condition:\n$$ x_i (u - (A y)_i) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\} $$\n\nSimilarly, for player 2 (column player), the strategy $y$ is a best response to $x$ if any pure strategy $j$ played with positive probability ($y_j  0$) yields the maximum possible payoff against $x$. Let $v$ be the expected payoff for player 2, $v = x^\\top B y$. The best response condition for player 2 is:\n$$ (B^\\top x)_j \\le v \\quad \\text{for all } j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} $$\nThis statement uses the transpose of $B$, $B^\\top$, to align with $x$. The expected payoff for player 2 for selecting pure strategy $j$ is $(x^\\top B)_j$, which is the $j$-th component of the row vector $x^\\top B$. In column vector notation, this is $(B^\\top x)_j$. The complementary slackness condition is:\n$$ y_j (v - (B^\\top x)_j) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} $$\n\nThe Lemke-Howson algorithm provides a constructive proof of the existence of a Nash Equilibrium by traversing a path of vertices on two polytopes representing these best-response conditions. The vertices of these polytopes correspond to strategy profiles. A Nash Equilibrium corresponds to a \"completely labeled\" vertex pair. This labeling system is a combinatorial representation of the complementary slackness conditions. Specifically, a profile is an NE if and only if for every pure strategy, either the strategy is not in the support (i.e., played with zero probability) or it is a best response.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Compute the Lemke–Howson labels at $(x, y)$ on the two best-response polytopes (one for each player) and check whether the pair is completely labeled, meaning that for every pure strategy $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,m\\}$ either $x_i = 0$ or the $i$th payoff constraint for player $1$ is binding against $y$, and for every pure strategy $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ either $y_j = 0$ or the $j$th payoff constraint for player $2$ is binding against $x$. If the pair is completely labeled, then $(x, y)$ is a Nash equilibrium.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the characterization of a Nash Equilibrium in the combinatorial language of the Lemke-Howson algorithm.\n- The condition \"either $x_i = 0$ or the $i$th payoff constraint for player $1$ is binding against $y$\" means that for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$, either $x_i = 0$ or $(A y)_i = \\max_k (A y)_k$. This is precisely the best response condition for player 1.\n- Similarly, the condition \"either $y_j = 0$ or the $j$th payoff constraint for player $2$ is binding against $x$\" means that for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, either $y_j = 0$ or $(B^\\top x)_j = \\max_l (B^\\top x)_l$. This is the best response condition for player 2.\nA strategy profile $(x, y)$ that satisfies both conditions for all pure strategies is, by definition, a Nash Equilibrium. The term \"completely labeled\" is the specific terminology used in the context of the Lemke-Howson algorithm to describe such a vertex pair. Therefore, this is a correct and valid method to test for a Nash Equilibrium using the conceptual framework of the algorithm.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Start the Lemke–Howson path-following from any arbitrary missing label at $(x, y)$ and accept $(x, y)$ as a Nash equilibrium if the resulting path terminates at any Nash equilibrium (not necessarily $(x, y)$).**\n\nThis statement describes an illogical procedure. The path-following part of the Lemke-Howson algorithm is designed to *find* a Nash Equilibrium, not to *verify* if a given point is one.\n- If $(x, y)$ is a Nash Equilibrium, it is completely labeled, meaning there are no missing labels. The algorithm, if initiated at such a point, would terminate immediately.\n- If $(x, y)$ is not a Nash Equilibrium, it will be missing at least two labels (unless it is the special artificial starting vertex). The standard algorithm cannot be initiated from such a vertex, as it requires starting from a vertex with exactly one missing label.\n- Even if a path could be started, the fact that it terminates at some Nash Equilibrium $(x', y')$ provides no information about whether the starting point $(x, y)$ was itself an equilibrium. The conclusion does not follow from the premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Initialize the Lemke–Howson algorithm at $(x, y)$ and, if the algorithm pivots at least once before terminating, conclude that $(x, y)$ is not a Nash equilibrium; otherwise, conclude that $(x, y)$ is a Nash equilibrium.**\n\nThis statement is flawed because its premise is invalid. The Lemke-Howson algorithm is not initialized at an arbitrary strategy profile $(x, y)$. The algorithm starts at a specific, artificially constructed vertex (typically corresponding to the origin of the strategy space, $(x, y) = (0, 0)$), which is known to be almost completely labeled. One cannot simply \"initialize the Lemke-Howson algorithm at $(x, y)$\". While it is true that a Nash Equilibrium is a fixed point (a completely labeled vertex) from which no pivot is made, the described procedure is not a valid application of the algorithm because the initialization step is ill-defined.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Formulate the associated linear complementarity problem that Lemke–Howson solves by introducing dual payoff variables $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and slack vectors for the payoff inequalities, and then check at $(x, y)$ whether the payoff inequalities and complementary slackness conditions hold componentwise: $A y \\le u \\mathbf{1}$, $B^{\\top} x \\le v \\mathbf{1}$, $x^{\\top}(u \\mathbf{1} - A y) = 0$, and $y^{\\top}(v \\mathbf{1} - B^{\\top} x) = 0$. If they hold with nonnegativity of strategies, then $(x, y)$ is a Nash equilibrium.**\n\nThis statement describes the analytical conditions for a Nash Equilibrium. These conditions are precisely what can be formulated as a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP), which the Lemke-Howson algorithm is designed to solve.\nLet us analyze the conditions for a given $(x, y)$ from the simplex:\n1.  $A y \\le u \\mathbf{1}$ and $B^{\\top} x \\le v \\mathbf{1}$: These are the payoff inequalities. They state that no pure strategy can yield a payoff strictly greater than some values $u$ and $v$.\n2.  $x^{\\top}(u \\mathbf{1} - A y) = 0$: Since $x_i \\ge 0$ and $(u \\mathbf{1} - A y)_i \\ge 0$, this sum is zero if and only if each term $x_i (u - (A y)_i)$ is zero. This is the complementary slackness condition for player 1. It implies that any strategy $i$ used with positive probability ($x_i  0$) must be a best response ($(A y)_i = u$).\n3.  $y^{\\top}(v \\mathbf{1} - B^{\\top} x) = 0$: Similarly, this is the complementary slackness condition for player 2.\nThese four conditions, together with $x \\in \\Delta_m$ and $y \\in \\Delta_n$, are the standard Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions that define a Nash equilibrium. The Lemke-Howson algorithm is a method for finding a solution to these conditions. Therefore, checking them directly for a given profile $(x, y)$ is a perfectly valid way to use the underlying mathematical foundation of the Lemke-Howson framework to test for a Nash Equilibrium.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2406285"}, {"introduction": "To truly grasp the Lemke-Howson algorithm, it is helpful to connect its abstract machinery to more familiar methods.

It operates by solving an associated Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). For a bimatrix game $(A, B)$ of size $m \\times n$ (here, $m=n=2$), the LCP is formulated using unnormalized strategy vectors $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ and $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. A pair $(x, y)$ corresponds to a Nash equilibrium if, after normalization, it satisfies the best response conditions.\n\nThe LCP formulation that LH solves is equivalent to finding non-negative vectors $x=(x_1, x_2)^T$ and $y=(y_1, y_2)^T$ that satisfy the following system of complementary slackness conditions:\nFor the Row player, with strategies $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$:\n$$\nx_i \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (B^T x)_j \\le 1 \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n$$\n$$\ny_j \\left( 1 - (B^T x)_j \\right) = 0 \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n$$\nFor the Column player, with strategies $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$:\n$$\ny_j \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (A y)_i \\le 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n$$\n$$\nx_i \\left( 1 - (A y)_i \\right) = 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2\\}\n$$\nA completely labeled vertex found by the LH algorithm corresponds to a Nash Equilibrium. The problem specifies a unique interior MSNE, which means the normalized equilibrium strategies $p^*$ and $q^*$ have all components strictly positive. This implies that the corresponding unnormalized strategy vectors $x$ and $y$ must also have all strictly positive components: $x_1  0$, $x_2  0$, $y_1  0$, $y_2  0$.\n\nWith this assumption, we can analyze the complementary slackness conditions.\nSince $x_1  0$ and $x_2  0$, the conditions $x_i(1 - (Ay)_i) = 0$ enforce that the slack must be zero:\n$$\n1 - (A y)_1 = 0 \\implies \\alpha y_1 + \\beta y_2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n1 - (A y)_2 = 0 \\implies \\gamma y_1 + \\delta y_2 = 1\n$$\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$$\n\\alpha y_1 + \\beta y_2 = \\gamma y_1 + \\delta y_2\n$$\nThe unnormalized vectors $x$ and $y$ are related to the probability vectors $p^*$ and $q^*$ by normalization: $q_1^*=q^* = \\frac{y_1}{y_1+y_2}$ and $q_2^*=1-q^* = \\frac{y_2}{y_1+y_2}$. Dividing the equation above by the total (non-zero) sum $y_1+y_2$ yields:\n$$\n\\alpha\\left(\\frac{y_1}{y_1+y_2}\\right) + \\beta\\left(\\frac{y_2}{y_1+y_2}\\right) = \\gamma\\left(\\frac{y_1}{y_1+y_2}\\right) + \\delta\\left(\\frac{y_2}{y_1+y_2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha q^* + \\beta (1-q^*) = \\gamma q^* + \\delta (1-q^*)\n$$\nThis is precisely the indifference condition for the Row player derived in Part 1.\n\nSimilarly, since $y_1  0$ and $y_2  0$, the conditions $y_j(1 - (B^T x)_j) = 0$ enforce that the slack must be zero:\n$$\n1 - (B^T x)_1 = 0 \\implies \\mu x_1 + \\xi x_2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n1 - (B^T x)_2 = 0 \\implies \\nu x_1 + \\zeta x_2 = 1\n$$\nEquating these gives:\n$$\n\\mu x_1 + \\xi x_2 = \\nu x_1 + \\zeta x_2\n$$\nNormalizing by $x_1+x_2$ with $p_1^*=p^* = \\frac{x_1}{x_1+x_2}$ and $p_2^*=1-p^* = \\frac{x_2}{x_1+x_2}$ yields:\n$$\n\\mu p^* + \\xi (1-p^*) = \\nu p^* + \\zeta (1-p^*)\n$$\nThis is the indifference condition for the Column player.\n\nTherefore, we have established that the equalities that hold at a completely labeled vertex corresponding to an interior Nash equilibrium in the Lemke-Howson algorithm are mathematically equivalent to the indifference conditions used to define and calculate that same equilibrium.

The problem states we must drop the label corresponding to the row player's pure strategy $1$, which is label $1$ ($x_1=0$).\n\nTo drop label $1$ from $\\bar{x}^{(0)}$, we must move away from the facet $\\bar{x}_1=0$. We pivot by increasing $\\bar{x}_1$ while keeping other non-basic variables ($\\bar{x}_2, \\bar{x}_3$) at $0$. We move along this edge until a new constraint becomes tight. The constraints on $\\bar{x}_1$ are:\n- $2\\bar{x}_1 \\le 1 \\implies \\bar{x}_1 \\le \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $6\\bar{x}_1 \\le 1 \\implies \\bar{x}_1 \\le \\frac{1}{6}$\n- $1\\bar{x}_1 \\le 1 \\implies \\bar{x}_1 \\le 1$\nThe most restrictive constraint is $\\bar{x}_1 \\le \\frac{1}{6}$, which arises from $(A'\\bar{x})_2=1$. This corresponds to label $5$.\nThe new vertex for the row player is $\\bar{x}^{(1)} = (1/6, 0, 0)$. At this vertex, the tight constraints are $\\bar{x}_2=0$ (label $2$), $\\bar{x}_3=0$ (label $3$), and $(A'\\bar{x})_2=1$ (label $5$). The label set is $L(\\bar{x}^{(1)}) = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$. As intended, label $1$ was dropped and label $5$ was picked up.\n\nThe current pair of vertices is $(\\bar{x}^{(1)}, \\bar{y}^{(0)})$. The combined label set is $L(\\bar{x}^{(1)}) \\cup L(\\bar{y}^{(0)}) = \\{2, 3, 5\\} \\cup \\{4, 5, 6\\} = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. Label $1$ is missing and label $5$ is duplicated.\n\nThe next step is to remove the duplicated label $5$ from the other polytope, $P_y$. Label $5$ on $P_y$ corresponds to the constraint $\\bar{y}_2=0$. To drop this label, we must move away from the $\\bar{y}_2=0$ facet by increasing $\\bar{y}_2$, while keeping $\\bar{y}_1=0$ and $\\bar{y}_3=0$. The constraints on $\\bar{y}_2$ are:\n- $((A')^{\\top}\\bar{y})_1 = 6\\bar{y}_2 \\le 1 \\implies \\bar{y}_2 \\le \\frac{1}{6}$\n- $((A')^{\\top}\\bar{y})_2 = 2\\bar{y}_2 \\le 1 \\implies \\bar{y}_2 \\le \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $((A')^{\\top}\\bar{y})_3 = 1\\bar{y}_2 \\le 1 \\implies \\bar{y}_2 \\le 1$\nThe most restrictive constraint is $\\bar{y}_2 \\le \\frac{1}{6}$, which arises from $((A')^{\\top}\\bar{y})_1=1$. This corresponds to label $1$.\nThe new vertex for the column player is $\\bar{y}^{(1)} = (0, 1/6, 0)$. At this vertex, the tight constraints are $\\bar{y}_1=0$ (label $4$), $\\bar{y}_3=0$ (label $6$), and $((A')^{\\top}\\bar{y})_1=1$ (label $1$). The label set is $L(\\bar{y}^{(1)}) = \\{1, 4, 6\\}$. Label $5$ was dropped and label $1$ was picked up.\n\nThe new pair of vertices is $(\\bar{x}^{(1)}, \\bar{y}^{(1)}) = ((1/6, 0, 0), (0, 1/6, 0))$. The combined label set is $L(\\bar{x}^{(1)}) \\cup L(\\bar{y}^{(1)}) = \\{2, 3, 5\\} \\cup \\{1, 4, 6\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nThis is again a completely labeled pair, so the algorithm terminates. This pair corresponds to a Nash Equilibrium of the game.\n\nThe unnormalized strategy vectors are $\\bar{x} = (1/6, 0, 0)$ and $\\bar{y} = (0, 1/6, 0)$. The normalized mixed strategies $x$ and $y$ are found by dividing these vectors by the sum of their components.\n$x = \\frac{\\bar{x}}{\\sum_i \\bar{x}_i} = \\frac{(1/6, 0, 0)}{1/6} = (1, 0, 0)$\n$y = \\frac{\\bar{y}}{\\sum_j \\bar{y}_j} = \\frac{(0, 1/6, 0)}{1/6} = (0, 1, 0)$\nThis corresponds to the pure strategy profile where the row player chooses strategy $1$ and the column player chooses strategy $2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the row player's expected payoff at this equilibrium. This is given by the entry $A_{12}$ of the original payoff matrix.\nPayoff$_{row} = x^{\\top} A y = (1, 0, 0) \\begin{pmatrix} 1  5  0 \\\\ 5  1  3 \\\\ 0  0  4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 5$.\n\nAlternatively, the expected payoff for the row player in the original game can be calculated from the result of the LH algorithm on the shifted game. The payoff for the row player in the game with matrix $A'$ is $u' = 1 / (\\sum_j \\bar{y}_j) = 1/(1/6) = 6$. To find the payoff $u$ in the original game with matrix $A$, we subtract the constant $k$ we added.\n$u = u' - k = 6 - 1 = 5$.\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$", "id": "2406279"}]}
