The numerical target is to approximate the optimal policy that satisfies the intertemporal optimality condition, and to report the maximum Euler-equation residual on an evaluation grid for several parameter sets. Your program must be a complete, runnable program and produce the specified single-line output.\n\nModel and fundamental base:\n- The representative agent chooses consumption $c_t$ and next-period capital $k_{t+1}$ to maximize the discounted sum of period utility\n$$\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t u(c_t),$$\nsubject to the law of motion for resources\n$$c_t + k_{t+1} = f(k_t) + (1-\\delta)\\,k_t,$$\nwith production $f(k) = A\\,k^{\\alpha}$, discount factor $\\beta \\in (0,1)$, capital share $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, depreciation rate $\\delta \\in (0,1)$, and productivity $A > 0$.

You may implement forward-mode dual numbers to achieve this behavior, so that the code remains self-contained and does not rely on external packages beyond the allowed libraries.\n\nNumerical specifications to ensure realism and reproducibility:\n- For each parameter set, compute the steady-state capital level $k^{\\ast}$ implied by the steady-state Euler condition\n$$f'(k^{\\ast}) + 1 - \\delta = \\frac{1}{\\beta}, \\quad\\text{that is}\\quad \\alpha A (k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} - 1 + \\delta,$$\nand set the approximation interval $[k_{\\min},k_{\\max}] = [\\zeta_1 k^{\\ast},\\, \\zeta_2 k^{\\ast}]$ with $\\zeta_1 = 0.7$ and $\\zeta_2 = 1.3$.\n- Use $n = 7$ Chebyshev basis functions and $n = 7$ collocation nodes.\n- Initialize the coefficients with a constant logit corresponding to the steady-state savings share $s^{\\ast} = \\frac{k^{\\ast}}{R(k^{\\ast})}$, i.e., set $a_0 = \\log\\left(\\frac{s^{\\ast}}{1-s^{\\ast}}\\right)$ and $a_j = 0$ for $j \\ge 1$.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement your solver and evaluate the quality of the projection solution by computing, for each parameter set below, the maximum absolute Euler residual on an evaluation grid of $M = 80$ equally spaced points over $[k_{\\min},k_{\\max}]$:\n$$\\max_{k \\in \\mathcal{G}} \\left| u'\\big(c(k;a)\\big) - \\beta\\,u'\\big(c(k';a)\\big)\\left(f'(k')+1-\\delta\\right) \\right|,$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{G}$ is the uniform grid and $k' = s(k;a)R(k)$, $c(k;a)=R(k)-k'$, $c(k';a)=R(k')-s(k';a)R(k')$ as above. Report this maximum as a floating-point number per test case.\n\nThe parameter sets are:\n- Case A (baseline): $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta,\\gamma,A) = (0.33,\\,0.96,\\,0.08,\\,2.0,\\,1.0)$.\n- Case B (patient): $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta,\\gamma,A) = (0.36,\\,0.99,\\,0.025,\\,2.0,\\,1.0)$.\n- Case C (high depreciation and risk aversion): $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta,\\gamma,A) = (0.40,\\,0.95,\\,0.15,\\,3.0,\\,1.0)$.\n- Case D (log utility): $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\delta,\\gamma,A) = (0.33,\\,0.97,\\,0.08,\\,1.0,\\,1.0)$.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements:\n- Use Newton's method with backtracking line search on the coefficient vector $a$ to solve $R(a) = 0$.

Each entry must be a floating-point number.\n\nNo physical units or angle units are involved. Express all final numerical values as plain floating-point numbers without percent signs. The program must be self-contained and must not require any user input or external files. The only allowed libraries are the Python standard library, NumPy, and SciPy as declared in the execution environment.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard, well-defined exercise in computational economics: the numerical solution of the deterministic neoclassical growth model using a projection method. All components of the problem—the economic model, the approximation architecture, and the numerical algorithm—are based on established and scientifically sound principles. The problem is self-contained, internally consistent, and Factual soundness, well-posedness, and objectivity are all satisfied, rendering the problem valid for a full solution.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental optimality condition of the model, the Euler equation, which links marginal utility across time:\n$$\nu'(c_t) = \\beta\\,u'(c_{t+1})\\left(f'(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta\\right)\n$$\nHere, $c_t$ is consumption at time $t$, $k_t$ is the capital stock, $\\beta$ is the discount factor, and $\\delta$ is the capital depreciation rate. The utility function is of the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) form, $u(c) = \\frac{c^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$ (or $\\ln(c)$ if $\\gamma=1$), for which the marginal utility is consistently $u'(c) = c^{-\\gamma}$. The production function is Cobb-Douglas, $f(k) = Ak^{\\alpha}$, with marginal product $f'(k) = \\alpha A k^{\\alpha-1}$.\n\nThe objective is to find the optimal policy function, which dictates the next period's capital, $k_{t+1}$, for any given current capital stock, $k_t$. We denote this function as $k_{t+1} = g(k_t)$. The projection method approximates this unknown function $g(k)$ with a known, parameterized functional form. The problem specifies a numerically stable parameterization via the savings share, $s(k) \\in (0,1)$, such that:\n$$\nk_{t+1} = s(k_t) R(k_t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_t = (1-s(k_t))R(k_t)\n$$\nwhere $R(k) = f(k) + (1-\\delta)k$ represents the total resources available from production and undepreciated capital. This formulation ensures the resource constraint is met by construction.\n\nTo facilitate approximation over an unbounded range, the savings share $s(k)$ is transformed using the logit function, $\\phi(k) = \\log\\left(\\frac{s(k)}{1-s(k)}\\right)$. This transformed policy function $\\phi(k)$ is approximated by a truncated series of $n$ Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, $T_j(x)$:\n$$\n\\phi(k; a) \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j T_j(x(k))\n$$\nwhere $a = (a_0, \\dots, a_{n-1})$ is the vector of unknown coefficients to be determined. The variable $x(k)$ is an affine transformation that maps the capital approximation domain $[k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$ to the domain of Chebyshev polynomials, $[-1, 1]$. Given the coefficients $a$, the savings share is recovered via the inverse logit (logistic) function, $s(k;a) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\phi(k;a)}}$.\n\nThe core of the projection method is to determine the coefficients $a$ by requiring the Euler equation to hold exactly at a set of $n$ specific points, known as collocation nodes. The problem specifies these nodes to be the $n$ roots of the Chebyshev polynomial $T_n(x)$, mapped back to the capital domain $[k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$. This creates a system of $n$ nonlinear equations for the $n$ unknown coefficients. For each collocation node $k_i$, we define a residual function $E_i(a)$:\n$$\nE_i(a) = u'(c_i) - \\beta u'(c'_i)(f'(k'_i) + 1 - \\delta) = 0\n$$\nwhere $c_i = c(k_i; a)$, $k'_i = k(k_i; a)$, and $c'_i = c(k'_i; a)$. The goal is to find the vector $a$ that solves the system $E(a) = 0$.\n\nThis system is solved using Newton's method, an iterative algorithm that requires the computation of the Jacobian matrix, $J(a) = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial a}(a)$. The entry $J_{ij}$ is the partial derivative of the $i$-th residual with respect to the $j$-th coefficient. The update rule for the coefficients is:\n$$\na_{new} = a_{old} - J(a_{old})^{-1} E(a_{old})\n$$\nThe problem demands the Jacobian be computed via forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD). This is achieved by implementing a dual number system. A dual number $z = v + \\dot{v}\\epsilon$ has a value part $v$ and a derivative part $\\dot{v}$, with the property $\\epsilon^2 = 0$. All mathematical operations and functions are overloaded to propagate derivatives according to the rules of calculus. For instance, for a function $h(z)$, we have $h(v + \\dot{v}\\epsilon) = h(v) + h'(v)\\dot{v}\\epsilon$. To compute the $j$-th column of the Jacobian, we initialize the coefficient vector as $a_k = a_k^{\\text{val}} + \\delta_{kj}\\epsilon$ (where $\\delta_{kj}$ is the Kronecker delta) and compute the entire residual vector $E$. The derivative part of the $i$-th resulting dual number, $\\dot{E_i}$, is precisely the Jacobian element $J_{ij}$.\n\nThe Newton's method is augmented with a backtracking line search to ensure robust convergence. If a full Newton step does not decrease the norm of the residual vector, the step size is successively reduced. The solver iterates until the infinity norm of the residual vector falls below a specified tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$.\n\nOnce the optimal coefficient vector $a^*$ is found, the quality of the approximation is assessed by computing the maximum absolute Euler equation residual on a fine grid of $M=80$ points spanning the approximation interval $[k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$. This value serves as the final reportable metric for each parameter set.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# ---- Automatic Differentiation: Dual Number Implementation ----\nclass Dual:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class for forward-mode automatic differentiation.\n    A Dual number z = val + der * epsilon, where epsilon^2 = 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, val, der=0.0):\n        self.val = val\n        self.der = der\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, Dual):\n            return Dual(self.val + other.val, self.der + other.der)\n        return Dual(self.val + other, self.der)\n\n    def __radd__(self, other):\n        return self.__add__(other)\n\n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, Dual):\n            return Dual(self.val - other.val, self.der - other.der)\n        return Dual(self.val - other, self.der)\n\n    def __rsub__(self, other):\n        return Dual(other - self.val, -self.der)\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, Dual):\n            return Dual(self.val * other.val, self.der * other.val + self.val * other.der)\n        return Dual(self.val * other, self.der * other)\n\n    def __rmul__(self, other):\n        return self.__mul__(other)\n\n    def __truediv__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, Dual):\n            val = self.val / other.val\n            der = (self.der * other.val - self.val * other.der) / (other.val**2)\n            return Dual(val, der)\n        return Dual(self.val / other, self.der / other)\n\n    def __rtruediv__(self, other):\n        val = other / self.val\n        der = (-other * self.der) / (self.val**2)\n        return Dual(val, der)\n\n    def __pow__(self, power):\n        val = self.val ** power\n        der = power * (self.val ** (power - 1)) * self.der\n        return Dual(val, der)\n\n    def __neg__(self):\n        return Dual(-self.val, -self.der)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Dual(val={self.val}, der={self.der})\"\n\ndef dual_exp(d):\n    if isinstance(d, Dual):\n        val = np.exp(d.val)\n        return Dual(val, val * d.der)\n    return np.exp(d)\n\ndef dual_pow(base, exp):\n    if isinstance(base, Dual):\n        return base ** exp\n    return base ** exp\n\n\n# ---- Model and Numerical Method Implementation ----\n\ndef chebyshev_poly_vals(x, n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluates the first n Chebyshev polynomials T_0, ..., T_{n-1} at x.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    \n    T = [1.0, x] if not isinstance(x, Dual) else [Dual(1.0), x]\n    \n    for _ in range(n - 2):\n        T.append(2.0 * x * T[-1] - T[-2])\n    return T[:n]\n\ndef evaluate_policy(k, coeffs, params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given capital k and coefficients a, computes c and k'.\n    This function handles both float and Dual types.\n    \"\"\"\n    alpha, _, delta, _, A, k_min, k_max, n = params\n    \n    is_dual = isinstance(coeffs[0], Dual) or isinstance(k, Dual)\n\n    # 1.

It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information to proceed. The task is to assess the accuracy of a pre-computed approximate policy function for the deterministic neoclassical growth model by calculating the maximum Euler equation residual over a specified domain. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the maximum absolute Euler equation residual, defined as\n$$\n\\text{Res}(k) = \\left| u'(\\hat{c}(k)) - \\beta \\, u'(\\hat{c}(k'(k))) \\left( A \\alpha (k'(k))^{\\alpha - 1} + 1 - \\delta \\right) \\right|,\n$$\nfor a set of capital grid points $k \\in [k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$. The policy function for consumption, $\\hat{c}(k)$, is approximated using a linear combination of the first four Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, $T_n(x)$.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Establish the Capital Grid**: A uniform grid of $N_{\\text{fine}}$ capital levels, denoted $\\{k_i\\}_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{fine}}}$, is constructed over the interval $[k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$. This grid includes the endpoints.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Current Consumption $\\hat{c}(k)$**: For each capital level $k_i$ on the grid, we first map it to the Chebyshev domain $x_i = x(k_i) \\in [-1,1]$ using the affine transformation:\n    $$\n    x(k_i) = \\frac{2 k_i - (k_{\\min} + k_{\\max})}{k_{\\max} - k_{\\min}}.\n    $$\n    The approximate consumption $\\hat{c}(k_i)$ is then computed by evaluating the Chebyshev polynomial expansion with the given coefficient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3)$:\n    $$\n    \\hat{c}(k_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{3} \\theta_j T_j(x(k_i)).\n    $$\n    The basis polynomials are $T_0(x) = 1$, $T_1(x) = x$, $T_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1$, and $T_3(x) = 4x^3 - 3x$.\n\n3.  **Determine Next-Period Capital $k'$**: Using the law of motion for capital, the implied next-period capital stock, $k'_i = k'(k_i)$, is calculated for each $k_i$:\n    $$\n    k'_i = A k_i^{\\alpha} + (1-\\delta) k_i - \\hat{c}(k_i).\n    $$\n\n4.  **Evaluate Next-Period Consumption $\\hat{c}(k')$**: The consumption in the next period, $\\hat{c}(k'_i)$, is determined by applying the same approximate policy function to the resulting capital stock $k'_i$. This involves mapping each $k'_i$ to its corresponding Chebyshev domain value $x'_i = x(k'_i)$ and evaluating the polynomial expansion:\n    $$\n    \\hat{c}(k'_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{3} \\theta_j T_j(x(k'_i)).\n    $$\n    Note that $k'_i$ is not guaranteed to be within the original approximation domain $[k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$. In such cases, the polynomial provides an extrapolation.\n\n5.  **Calculate Marginal Utilities**: The marginal utility of consumption, $u'(c)$, is evaluated for both current and next-period consumption. The function depends on the coefficient of relative risk aversion, $\\sigma$:\n    $$\n    u'(c) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n    c^{-\\sigma}, & \\text{if } \\sigma \\neq 1, \\\\\n    c^{-1}, & \\text{if } \\sigma = 1.\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    We compute $u'(\\hat{c}(k_i))$ and $u'(\\hat{c}(k'_i))$ for all points on the grid.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Euler Equation Residual**: For each grid point $k_i$, the two sides of the Euler equation are computed and compared. The left-hand side (LHS) is $u'(\\hat{c}(k_i))$. The right-hand side (RHS) is\n    $$\n    \\text{RHS}_i = \\beta \\, u'(\\hat{c}(k'_i)) \\left( A \\alpha (k'_i)^{\\alpha - 1} + 1 - \\delta \\right).\n    $$\n    The term $A \\alpha (k'_i)^{\\alpha - 1} + 1 - \\delta$ represents the gross return on capital in the next period. The absolute residual at $k_i$ is $\\text{Res}(k_i) = |\\text{LHS}_i - \\text{RHS}_i|$.\n\n7.  **Find the Maximum Residual**: After calculating the residual $\\text{Res}(k_i)$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N_{\\text{fine}}$, the maximum value is identified:\n    $$\n    \\max_{i} \\text{Res}(k_i).\n    $$\nThis maximum value quantifies the largest error of the approximate policy function in satisfying the model's optimality condition over the specified grid.

The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to find an approximate solution for the optimal consumption-savings policy in a stochastic growth model. The economy's dynamics are governed by the intertemporal Euler equation, which equates the marginal utility cost of sacrificing a unit of current consumption to the expected discounted marginal utility benefit of the resulting future consumption. The state of the economy is described by the capital stock, $k$, and the logarithm of productivity, $s$.\n\nThe governing functional equation is the Euler equation:\n$$\nu'(c_t) = \\beta \\mathbb{E}_t\\left[u'(c_{t+1})\\left(\\alpha z_{t+1} k_{t+1}^{\\alpha-1} + 1 - \\delta\\right)\\right]\n$$\nwhere $u'(c) = c^{-\\gamma}$ is the marginal utility of consumption, $\\beta$ is the discount factor, $\\alpha$ is the capital share in production, $\\delta$ is the capital depreciation rate, and $z_{t+1} = \\exp(s_{t+1})$ is the future productivity level.

Solving the steady-state Euler equation $1 = \\beta (\\alpha \\mathbb{E}[z] (k^{\\star})^{\\alpha-1} + 1 - \\delta)$ yields:\n$$\nk^{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\mathbb{E}[z]}{\\frac{1}{\\beta} - 1 + \\delta} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}\n$$\nThe expectation $\\mathbb{E}[z]$ is computed with respect to the specified mixture-of-normals distribution for $s$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[z] = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(s)] = p \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1,\\sigma_1^2)}[\\exp(s)] + (1-p) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2,\\sigma_2^2)}[\\exp(s)] = p e^{\\mu_1 + \\sigma_1^2/2} + (1-p) e^{\\mu_2 + \\sigma_2^2/2}\n$$\nThe domain for $k$ is then set to $[0.75 k^{\\star}, 1.25 k^{\\star}]$.\n- The domain for the productivity shock $s$ is set to cover the bulk of its probability mass: $[\\min(\\mu_1 - 3\\sigma_1, \\mu_2 - 3\\sigma_2), \\max(\\mu_1 + 3\\sigma_1, \\mu_2 + 3\\sigma_2)]$.\n\nTo solve for the coefficients $\\theta$, we use the collocation method. We enforce the Euler equation at a set of discrete points (collocation nodes) within the domain. These nodes are chosen as the tensor product of the roots of Chebyshev polynomials, specifically a grid of $N_k=7$ points for capital and $N_s=5$ points for log-productivity.\n\n**3. Euler Equation Residual and Solution**\n\nThe approximated policy function $\\phi(k,s;\\theta)$ will not satisfy the Euler equation exactly. We define the Euler equation residual $\\mathcal{R}(k,s;\\theta)$ as the difference between the left and right sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(k,s;\\theta) \\equiv c(k,s;\\theta)^{-\\gamma} - \\beta \\mathbb{E}\\left[c'(k,s;\\theta,s')^{-\\gamma}\\left(\\alpha \\exp(s') k'(k,s;\\theta)^{\\alpha-1} + 1-\\delta\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe coefficients $\\theta$ are chosen to minimize the sum of squared residuals over the set of collocation nodes. This is a nonlinear least-squares problem: $\\min_{\\theta} \\sum_{i,j} [\\mathcal{R}(k_i, s_j; \\theta)]^2$.\n\n**4. Numerical Quadrature for Expectation**\n\nA central task is the numerical evaluation of the expectation term. The problem mandates a comparison of two schemes, both based on $N_q=7$-point Gaussian-Hermite quadrature. For a generic function $g(s')$, the expectation under a normal distribution $s' \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is approximated as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[g(s')] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(\\mu + \\sqrt{2}\\sigma x) e^{-x^2} dx \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_q} w_j g(\\mu + \\sqrt{2}\\sigma x_j)\n$$\nwhere $(x_j, w_j)$ are the standard Gaussian-Hermite quadrature nodes and weights.\n\n- **Naive Single-Normal Scheme:** The bimodal mixture distribution of $s'$ is approximated by a single normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{mix}}, \\sigma_{\\text{mix}}^2)$ with matching mean and variance.\n    - $\\mu_{\\text{mix}} = p\\mu_1 + (1-p)\\mu_2$\n    - $\\sigma_{\\text{mix}}^2 = [p\\sigma_1^2 + (1-p)\\sigma_2^2] + p(1-p)(\\mu_1-\\mu_2)^2$\n    The expectation is then computed using the formula above with parameters $(\\mu_{\\text{mix}}, \\sigma_{\\text{mix}})$.\n\n- **Mixture-Correct Scheme:** The expectation is computed directly using the definition of the mixture distribution:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[g(s')] = p \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1,\\sigma_1^2)}[g(s')] + (1-p) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2,\\sigma_2^2)}[g(s')]\n    $$\n    Each of the two expectation terms on the right is evaluated using its own Gaussian-Hermite quadrature, one centered at $\\mu_1$ with scale $\\sigma_1$, and the other at $\\mu_2$ with scale $\\sigma_2$.\n\n**5. Validation**\n\nWe obtain two sets of coefficients: $\\theta_{\\text{naive}}$ by solving with the naive quadrature, and $\\theta_{\\text{mix}}$ by solving with the mixture-correct quadrature. The quality of these solutions is assessed by evaluating the supremum norm of the Euler residual on a finer validation grid ($N_k^{\\text{val}}=13 \\times N_s^{\\text{val}}=9$). Crucially, for both policies, this validation residual is computed using the accurate **mixture-correct quadrature**. This procedure isolates the error introduced by the naive approximation during the solution phase. The quantities to be reported are:\n- $r_{\\text{mix}}$: sup-norm of the residual for the policy $\\phi(k,s;\\theta_{\\text{mix}})$, which serves as our benchmark.\n- $r_{\\text{naive}\\to\\text{true}}$: sup-norm of the residual for the policy $\\phi(k,s;\\theta_{\\text{naive}})$, showing the error of the naive policy when evaluated correctly.\n- $\\Delta r = r_{\\text{naive}\\to\\text{true}} - r_{\\text{mix}}$: the excess error attributable to the naive approximation method.\n\nThis rigorous process allows for a quantitative comparison of the two quadrature schemes for handling mixture distributions in this class of models.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import least_squares\nfrom scipy.special import expit, logit\nfrom numpy.polynomial import chebyshev, hermite\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fixed structural parameters\n    alpha = 0.33\n    beta = 0.96\n    delta = 0.08\n    gamma = 2.0\n\n    # Numerical approximation parameters\n    d_k = 3\n    d_s = 2\n    N_k = 7\n    N_s = 5\n    N_q = 7\n    N_k_val = 13\n    N_s_val = 9\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: balanced bimodality\n        {'p': 0.5, 'mu1': -0.1, 'sigma1': 0.05, 'mu2': 0.1, 'sigma2': 0.05},\n        # Case B: asymmetric and more separated\n        {'p': 0.7, 'mu1': -0.2, 'sigma1': 0.08, 'mu2': 0.2, 'sigma2': 0.08},\n        # Case C: degenerate to unimodal\n        {'p': 0.4, 'mu1': 0.0, 'sigma1': 0.07, 'mu2': 0.0, 'sigma2': 0.07},\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case_params in test_cases:\n        params = {\n            'alpha': alpha, 'beta': beta, 'delta': delta, 'gamma': gamma,\n            **case_params\n        }\n        \n        # Unpack degrees and grid sizes\n        degrees = (d_k, d_s)\n        collocation_grid_sizes = (N_k, N_s)\n        validation_grid_sizes = (N_k_val, N_s_val)\n\n        r_mix, r_naive_to_true, delta_r = solve_case(\n            params, degrees, collocation_grid_sizes, validation_grid_sizes, N_q\n        )\n        all_results.extend([r_mix, r_naive_to_true, delta_r])\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, all_results))}]\")\n\ndef solve_case(params, degrees, collocation_grid_sizes, validation_grid_sizes, N_q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for and validates policies for a single parameter case.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
