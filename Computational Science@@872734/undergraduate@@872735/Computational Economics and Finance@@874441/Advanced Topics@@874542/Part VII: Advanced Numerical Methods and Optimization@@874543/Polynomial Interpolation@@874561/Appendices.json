The efficient frontier describes the set of optimal portfolios. The weights of assets in these portfolios are functions of the desired expected return. While standard unconstrained theory implies linear relationships, the inclusion of no-short-selling constraints ($w_i \\ge 0$) makes the problem a quadratic program, and the relationship can be more complex (piecewise).

The problem provides three pairs of $(\\mu, w_i)$ for each asset, which is exactly the data required to determine the unique interpolating polynomial for each $w_i(\\mu)$.\n- **Internal Consistency Check**: The problem states portfolios are fully invested, so the weights must sum to $1$.\n  - At $\\mu_1 = 0.08$: $0.20 + 0.50 + 0.30 = 1.00$.\n  - At $\\mu_2 = 0.10$: $0.35 + 0.40 + 0.25 = 1.00$.\n  - At $\\mu_3 = 0.12$: $0.50 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 1.00$.\n  The provided data is consistent with this constraint. Let $W(\\mu) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,B,C\\}} w_i(\\mu)$. Since each $w_i(\\mu)$ is a polynomial of degree at most two, $W(\\mu)$ must also be a polynomial of degree at most two. As $W(\\mu_1) = W(\\mu_2) = W(\\mu_3) = 1$, the only such polynomial is the constant polynomial $W(\\mu) = 1$.

This statement is a matter of direct computation and is factually correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B) If, instead of using three points, one uses more past ticks and fits a higher-degree interpolating polynomial through equally spaced data, the one-step-ahead extrapolation at $t=4$ becomes more stable as the degree increases; therefore, this approach becomes more reliable with more past points.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. In numerical analysis, it is a well-known result that increasing the degree of a polynomial interpolant over equally spaced points does not guarantee better approximation, especially near the endpoints of the interval. This issue is known as the Runge phenomenon, which leads to large oscillations. Extrapolation, which is evaluation outside the interval of data points, is notoriously unstable for high-degree polynomials. The instability and potential for error amplification typically increase, not decrease, with the polynomial degree. Therefore, the prediction does not become more stable; it becomes more erratic and unreliable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C) In a frictionless, approximately arbitrage-free market at the tick horizon where drift is negligible, the conditional expectation of the next price increment given current information is approximately zero, so interpolating past levels is not an unbiased or efficient predictor of the next tick and can produce large extrapolation errors.**\nThis statement presents a correct critique from the perspective of modern financial theory. High-frequency price movements are often modeled as a martingale, which implies $E[S(t+1) - S(t) | \\mathcal{F}_t] \\approx 0$, where $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is the information set at time $t$. The current interpolation method, however, predicts a price change of $S(4) - S(3) = -1.3$, a substantial deviation from zero. The method imposes a deterministic, smooth structure on what is largely a stochastic process. This makes the predictor biased (it systematically forecasts trends based on very short-term history) and inefficient (it ignores the stochastic nature of the price process). The large extrapolation errors are a natural consequence of applying a deterministic smooth model to noisy, random-walk-like data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D) This procedure ignores market microstructure noise (for example, bid-ask bounce and price discreteness) and enforces smoothness not present in tick data, so small observation errors in the last few points can induce large swings in the extrapolated prediction; in practice, latency and transaction costs would overwhelm any such fragile signal.**\nThis statement correctly identifies several critical flaws from a practical standpoint.\n1.  **Market Microstructure Noise:** Tick-by-tick data is not smooth; it is affected by the bid-ask spread, the discrete nature of price levels, and other effects which are non-differentiable and noisy. Polynomial interpolation enforces a $C^\\infty$ smoothness that is entirely artificial.\n2.  **Instability:** Polynomial extrapolation is an ill-conditioned problem. Small perturbations in the input data (e.g., noise in the measured prices) can lead to disproportionately large changes in the output (the extrapolated value). The signal is fragile. For instance, a small change in $S(3)$ from $100.1$ to $100.2$ would change the prediction $S(4)$ from $98.8$ to $99.1$, amplifying the input change.\n3.  **Practical Frictions:** In High-Frequency Trading, execution latency and transaction costs are paramount. Any predictive signal must be strong and robust enough to generate profits that exceed these costs. A fragile signal derived from an ill-posed extrapolation is highly unlikely to be profitable in a real-world trading environment.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E) The Runge phenomenon applies only to interpolation on bounded intervals and does not affect extrapolation beyond the data, so it is irrelevant to the instability of the one-step-ahead prediction here; consequently, polynomial interpolation is well-suited to forecasting the next tick in this setting.**\nThis statement is built on a sequence of false premises. The Runge phenomenon, characterized by large oscillations of high-degree polynomial interpolants near the endpoints of an interval, is a manifestation of the inherent instability of this type of interpolation. This very instability is what makes extrapolation (evaluating the polynomial *outside* the interval) even more hazardous and unreliable. The phenomenon is therefore directly relevant to the instability of extrapolation. The conclusion that the method is \"well-suited\" is diametrically opposed to both numerical theory and financial practice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2419954"}]}
