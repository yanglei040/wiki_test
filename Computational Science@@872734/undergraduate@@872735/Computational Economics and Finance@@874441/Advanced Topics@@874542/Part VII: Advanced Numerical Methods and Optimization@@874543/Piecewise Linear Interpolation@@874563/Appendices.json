It is well-posed, objective, and complete. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe methodology specified is piecewise linear interpolation in strike $K$ for call and put prices independently. For a function $f(x)$ with known values at points $x_1$ and $x_2$, the linearly interpolated value at an intermediate point $x$ is given by the formula:\n$$f(x) = f(x_1) + (x - x_1) \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$$\n\nFirst, we apply this formula to interpolate the call price $C(K)$ at the target strike $K^{\\ast} = 100$. The known data points are $(K_1, C(K_1)) = (95, 9)$ and $(K_2, C(K_2)) = (105, 4)$.\n$$\nC_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) = C(K_1) + (K^{\\ast} - K_1) \\frac{C(K_2) - C(K_1)}{K_2 - K_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nC_{\\text{lin}}(100) = 9 + (100 - 95) \\frac{4 - 9}{105 - 95} = 9 + (5) \\frac{-5}{10} = 9 - 2.5 = 6.5\n$$\n\nNext, we perform the same interpolation for the put price $P(K)$. The known data points are $(K_1, P(K_1)) = (95, 4)$ and $(K_2, P(K_2)) = (105, 9)$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) = P(K_1) + (K^{\\ast} - K_1) \\frac{P(K_2) - P(K_1)}{K_2 - K_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nP_{\\text{lin}}(100) = 4 + (100 - 95) \\frac{9 - 4}{105 - 95} = 4 + (5) \\frac{5}{10} = 4 + 2.5 = 6.5\n$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the put-call parity residual $R$, as defined in the problem statement:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\bigl(C_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) - P_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast})\\bigr) - \\bigl(S_0 \\exp(-q T) - K^{\\ast} \\exp(-r T)\\bigr)\n$$\nWe have the interpolated values $C_{\\text{lin}}(100) = 6.5$ and $P_{\\text{lin}}(100) = 6.5$. The first term of the residual is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) - P_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) = 6.5 - 6.5 = 0\n$$\nThe second term, which is the theoretical price difference from put-call parity at $K^{\\ast}$, is:\n$$\nS_0 \\exp(-q T) - K^{\\ast} \\exp(-r T) = 100 \\exp(-0 \\cdot 0.5) - 100 \\exp(-0 \\cdot 0.5) = 100 \\cdot 1 - 100 \\cdot 1 = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results into the definition of $R$:\n$$\nR = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\n\nThis result is not an accident of the specific numbers chosen. It illustrates a general property of linear operators. Since interpolation is a linear operation, and the put-call parity check is a linear functional of the prices, the property holds for the interpolated values if it holds at the endpoints.\nLet the interpolation weight be $w = \\frac{K^{\\ast} - K_1}{K_2 - K_1}$. The interpolated prices are:\n$$\nC_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) = (1-w) C(K_1) + w C(K_2)\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) = (1-w) P(K_1) + w P(K_2)\n$$\nThe difference of the interpolated prices is a linear combination of the endpoint differences:\n$$\nC_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) - P_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) = (1-w) [C(K_1) - P(K_1)] + w [C(K_2) - P(K_2)]\n$$\nGiven that the endpoints satisfy parity, $C(K) - P(K) = S_0 \\exp(-qT) - K \\exp(-rT)$, we substitute this relationship:\n$$\nC_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) - P_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) = (1-w)[S_0 e^{-qT} - K_1 e^{-rT}] + w[S_0 e^{-qT} - K_2 e^{-rT}]\n$$\n$$\n= S_0 e^{-qT} - [(1-w)K_1 + wK_2]e^{-rT}\n$$\nBy definition of linear interpolation, $K^{\\ast} = (1-w)K_1 + wK_2$. Therefore,\n$$\nC_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) - P_{\\text{lin}}(K^{\\ast}) = S_0 e^{-qT} - K^{\\ast}e^{-rT}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that if the input data for interpolation is free of arbitrage (i.e., satisfies put-call parity), then the set of interpolated prices is also arbitrage-free in the same sense. The residual $R$ must therefore be identically zero.

All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and the task is to implement a clearly specified numerical algorithm. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe core principle to be tested is the convexity of European call option prices with respect to the strike price. In an arbitrage-free market, the call price function, $C(K)$, must be convex in strike $K$. This implies that its second derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial K^2}$, must be non-negative. This second derivative is directly related to the risk-neutral probability density function of the underlying asset's price at maturity, $T$, via the Breeden-Litzenberger formula: $\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial K^2} = e^{rT} p(S_T = K)$. A negative value for this derivative would imply a negative probability, which is a clear sign of an arbitrage opportunity.\n\nA discrete approximation to the second derivative is the butterfly spread, defined for a triplet of strikes $K-h$, $K$, and $K+h$ (with $h>0$) as:\n$$ B(K;h) \\equiv C(K-h) - 2C(K) + C(K+h) $$\nThe no-arbitrage condition requires $B(K;h) \\ge 0$. The problem asks us to check this condition on a discrete grid of strikes for specified volatility smiles.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Model and Parameter Setup**: We are given the fixed market parameters: spot price $S_0 = 100$, time to maturity $T = 1$ year, risk-free rate $r = 0$, and dividend yield $\\delta = 0$. The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) price for a European call option under these conditions is:\n    $$ C(K) = S_0 \\Phi(d_1) - K \\Phi(d_2) $$\n    where $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and the terms $d_1$ and $d_2$ are:\n    $$ d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(K)^2 T}{\\sigma(K)\\sqrt{T}} $$\n    $$ d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma(K)\\sqrt{T} $$\n    The implied volatility, $\\sigma(K)$, is not constant but is a function of the strike price $K$.\n\n2.  **Implied Volatility Interpolation**: For each test case, the volatility smile is defined by a set of nodes $\\{(K_i, \\sigma_i)\\}_{i=1}^m$. For any strike $K$ within the range $[K_1, K_m]$, the value of $\\sigma(K)$ is determined by piecewise linear interpolation. If $K$ falls within an interval $[K_i, K_{i+1}]$, its volatility is given by the affine function:\n    $$ \\sigma(K) = \\sigma_i + \\frac{\\sigma_{i+1} - \\sigma_i}{K_{i+1} - K_i} (K - K_i) $$\n\n3.  **Numerical Evaluation Grid**: For each case, we define a evaluation range $[K_{\\min}, K_{\\max}]$, where $K_{\\min} = K_1$ and $K_{\\max} = K_m$. An equally spaced grid of $N=81$ strikes, $\\{K_j\\}_{j=0}^{N-1}$, is constructed over this range, where $K_0=K_{\\min}$ and $K_{N-1}=K_{\\max}$.\n\n4.  **Computation of Call Prices and Butterfly Spreads**: We proceed through a sequence of computations for each test case:\n    a. For each strike $K_j$ on the grid, we first calculate the corresponding implied volatility $\\sigma(K_j)$ using the piecewise linear interpolation function.\n    b. Using this $\\sigma(K_j)$, we compute the BSM call price $C(K_j)$. This results in a vector of call prices $\\{C(K_j)\\}_{j=0}^{N-1}$.\n    c. For each interior point of the grid, with index $j$ from $1$ to $N-2$, we compute the discrete butterfly spread price:\n       $$ B_j = C(K_{j-1}) - 2C(K_j) + C(K_{j+1}) $$\n    \n5.  **Arbitrage Detection**: The final step is to find the minimum value among all computed butterfly spreads:\n    $$ b_{\\min} = \\min_{1 \\le j \\le N-2} B_j $$\n    A negative value for $b_{\\min}$ signifies a violation of the no-arbitrage condition, indicating that the given volatility smile is not consistent with a valid risk-neutral density. For Case A (flat smile), we expect $b_{\\min} \\ge 0$, as the standard BSM model is arbitrage-free. For Case B (spiky smile), the extreme convexity in the volatility function is known to potentially cause non-convexity in the call price function, so we might find $b_{\\min}  0$. Case C presents a more realistic, sloped smile, whose arbitrage-freeness must be verified numerically.\n\nThe implementation will utilize `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` for the volatility function and `scipy.stats.norm.cdf` for the function $\\Phi$. All vector and matrix operations will be handled by `numpy` for efficiency.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nfrom scipy.interpolate import interp1d\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the minimum butterfly spread price for different volatility smiles\n    to check for arbitrage.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fixed market inputs for all test cases\n    S0 = 100.0\n    T = 1.0\n    # r = 0, delta = 0 are implicitly used in the simplified BSM formula.\n\n    # Grid parameters\n    N = 81\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: flat smile\n        [\n            (70.0, 0.20), (85.0, 0.20), (100.0, 0.20), (115.0, 0.20), (130.0, 0.20)\n        ],\n        # Case B: spiky smile\n        [\n            (70.0, 0.15), (85.0, 0.15), (100.0, 0.90), (115.0, 0.15), (130.0, 0.15)\n        ],\n        # Case C: sloped smile\n        [\n            (80.0, 0.18), (100.0, 0.20), (120.0, 0.22)\n        ],\n    ]\n\n    def bsm_call_price(K, sigma_K):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the BSM European call price for r=0, delta=0.\n        K and sigma_K can be numpy arrays.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Handle cases where sigma_K might be zero or K is zero to avoid division by zero or log(0)\n        # However, problem constraints (sigma_i > 0, K_i > 0) make this unlikely\n        # for interpolated values.
