You must implement a complete program that produces deterministic outputs from first principles.\n\nBase definitions to use:\n- Losses are represented by a sequence $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ where $L_t \\ge 0$ denotes the loss at time $t$.\n- Value at Risk (VaR) at tail probability level $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is the smallest threshold $v_\\alpha$ such that $\\mathbb{P}(L_t \\le v_\\alpha) \\ge 1 - \\alpha$. When a model supplies a sequence $\\{v_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ of one-step-ahead VaR forecasts, a violation at time $t$ is the event $L_t  v_t$.\n- The exceedance indicator is $I_t = \\mathbf{1}\\{L_t  v_t\\}$. Under correct unconditional coverage, the sequence $\\{I_t\\}$ is an independent and identically distributed Bernoulli process with success probability $\\alpha$.\n- Expected Shortfall (ES) at level $\\alpha$ is the conditional expectation of the loss given that the loss exceeds the VaR threshold: $\\mathrm{ES}_\\alpha = \\mathbb{E}[L_t \\mid L_t  v_\\alpha]$.\n- The Kupiec Unconditional Coverage Likelihood Ratio (LR) test compares the Bernoulli likelihood under the null violation probability $\\alpha$ versus the likelihood under the maximum-likelihood estimate $\\hat{p}$. The null hypothesis is that the unconditional violation rate equals $\\alpha$. The LR statistic is asymptotically $\\chi^2$ with $1$ degree of freedom, and from it you must compute a $p$-value and determine whether the test fails to reject the null at significance level $0.05$.\n\nYour tasks:\n1. For each provided test case, construct a synthetic sequence of losses $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ and a constant VaR forecast sequence $\\{v_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ with $v_t \\equiv v$, such that:\n   - Exactly $x = \\alpha T$ time points are violations, with $L_t = 10 v$ on these violation times.\n   - All other times are non-violations, with $L_t = 0.5 v$.\n   - Note: All mathematical entities, including $10$, $0.5$, and $x$, must be respected as constraints in your construction.\n2. From the constructed $\\{L_t\\}$ and $\\{v_t\\}$, compute the exceedance indicators $\\{I_t\\}$ and the number of violations $x = \\sum_{t=1}^T I_t$ for each case.\n3. Implement the Kupiec Unconditional Coverage Likelihood Ratio test for each case based only on the Bernoulli likelihood principle and the asymptotic $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom. Use this test to compute the $p$-value and a boolean indicating whether the test fails to reject at significance level $0.05$.\n4. Compute the realized Expected Shortfall ratio for each case, defined as $M = \\left(\\frac{1}{x} \\sum_{t=1}^T I_t L_t\\right) / v$ when $x \\ge 1$. In your construction, this ratio should reveal systematic tail severity relative to the model VaR level.\n5. Your implementation must be deterministic and must not rely on any external randomness.\n\nTest suite:\nYou must run your program on the following parameter sets $(T,\\alpha,v)$, where $T$ is the length, $\\alpha$ is the violation probability as a decimal, and $v$ is the constant VaR level:\n- Case A: $(T,\\alpha,v) = (1000, 0.01, 1.0)$\n- Case B: $(T,\\alpha,v) = (250, 0.04, 2.0)$\n- Case C: $(T,\\alpha,v) = (200, 0.055, 0.5)$\n- Case D (small-sample coverage check): $(T,\\alpha,v) = (20, 0.1, 3.0)$\n\nFor each case, output a list of three items in this exact order:\n- A boolean indicating whether the Kupiec test fails to reject at significance level $0.05$.\n- The Kupiec test $p$-value as a floating-point number.\n- The realized Expected Shortfall ratio $M$ as a floating-point number.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing a list of per-case results, where each per-case result is a three-element list in the order specified above. For example, the final single line should look like:\n- $[\\,[\\text{True}, 1.0, 10.0], [\\text{True}, 0.9999, 10.0]\\,]$\n- Your code must print exactly one line with this list, with no additional text.\n\nImportant implementation notes:\n- Treat violations as $L_t  v_t$ with losses and VaR both nonnegative.\n- Ensure that $x = \\alpha T$ is an integer in each test case as provided. Do not randomize the placement of violations; a simple deterministic placement is acceptable.\n- Use significance level $0.05$ for the Kupiec decision.\n- Angles and physical units are not applicable. Percentages must be expressed as decimals, which is already satisfied by the given $\\alpha$ values.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of financial risk management, specifically the backtesting of risk models. All definitions and constraints are well-posed, complete, and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The task is to construct a specific scenario to illustrate a known limitation of Value at Risk ($VaR$) when compared to Expected Shortfall ($ES$).\n\nThe objective is to create a synthetic profit-and-loss ($PL$) history, represented by a sequence of losses $\\{L_t\\}_{t=1}^T$, and a corresponding sequence of one-step-ahead $VaR$ forecasts, $\\{v_t\\}_{t=1}^T$. This construction must be deliberately misspecified such that the $VaR$ model passes a standard backtest—the Kupiec unconditional coverage test—while simultaneously concealing a severe underestimation of tail loss magnitude, a flaw that an $ES$-based metric would expose.\n\nFirst, we address the construction of the synthetic data for each given test case, which is a triplet of parameters $(T, \\alpha, v)$. $T$ is the total number of time periods, $\\alpha$ is the target violation probability, and $v$ is the constant $VaR$ forecast level.\n\nThe problem dictates a constant $VaR$ forecast:\n$$ v_t = v \\quad \\forall t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\} $$\n\nA violation, or exceedance, at time $t$ is defined by the event $L_t  v_t$. The construction demands that the total number of violations, $x$, must be exactly $x = \\alpha T$. For the test cases provided, this product is an integer. To ensure determinism, we can place these $x$ violations at the beginning of the time series, from $t=1$ to $t=x$.\n\nThe loss values are specified as follows:\n- For violation periods ($t \\in \\{1, \\dots, x\\}$): $L_t = 10v$. This satisfies the violation condition $L_t  v$ as $v$ must be positive.\n- For non-violation periods ($t \\in \\{x+1, \\dots, T\\}$): $L_t = 0.5v$. This does not constitute a violation, as $0.5v \\ngtr v$.\n\nThe exceedance indicator sequence $\\{I_t\\}_{t=1}^T$ is thus $I_t = 1$ for $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, x\\}$ and $I_t = 0$ for $t \\in \\{x+1, \\dots, T\\}$.\n\nNext, we perform the Kupiec Unconditional Coverage Likelihood Ratio ($LR$) test. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the true probability of a violation is $p = \\alpha$. The test statistic is based on comparing the likelihood of the observed data under $H_0$ with the likelihood under the maximum-likelihood estimate, $\\hat{p} = x/T$. The $LR$ statistic is given by:\n$$ LR_{uc} = 2 \\ln \\left( \\frac{L(\\hat{p})}{L(\\alpha)} \\right) = 2 \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\hat{p}^x (1 - \\hat{p})^{T-x}}{\\alpha^x (1-\\alpha)^{T-x}} \\right) $$\nThis expression can be rewritten as:\n$$ LR_{uc} = 2 \\left[ x \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p}}{\\alpha}\\right) + (T-x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\hat{p}}{1-\\alpha}\\right) \\right] $$\nBy our specific construction, the number of violations is $x = \\alpha T$. Therefore, the empirical violation rate is $\\hat{p} = x/T = (\\alpha T)/T = \\alpha$. Substituting $\\hat{p} = \\alpha$ into the $LR_{uc}$ formula yields:\n$$ LR_{uc} = 2 \\left[ (\\alpha T) \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right) + (T-\\alpha T) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\right) \\right] = 2 \\left[ (\\alpha T) \\ln(1) + T(1-\\alpha) \\ln(1) \\right] = 0 $$\nThe $LR_{uc}$ statistic is, therefore, identically zero. This statistic is asymptotically distributed as a chi-squared distribution with $1$ degree of freedom, $\\chi^2(1)$. The $p$-value of the test is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one computed, i.e., $P(\\chi^2(1) \\ge LR_{uc})$. With $LR_{uc}=0$, the $p$-value is:\n$$ p\\text{-value} = \\int_0^\\infty f(z; 1) dz = 1 $$\nwhere $f(z; 1)$ is the probability density function of the $\\chi^2(1)$ distribution. The null hypothesis is rejected if the $p$-value is below the significance level, which is given as $0.05$. Since $1.0  0.05$, we unconditionally fail to reject the null hypothesis for all test cases. The $VaR$ model passes the coverage test perfectly.\n\nFinally, we analyze the model's performance concerning the magnitude of tail losses using the realized Expected Shortfall ratio, $M$. This is defined as the ratio of the empirical average loss on violation days to the $VaR$ level:\n$$ M = \\frac{\\frac{1}{x} \\sum_{t=1}^T I_t L_t}{v} $$\nThe sum $\\sum_{t=1}^T I_t L_t$ represents the total loss across all $x$ violation days. According to our construction, the loss on each of these days is $L_t = 10v$. So, the sum is $x \\cdot 10v$. The average loss on violation days is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} \\sum_{t=1}^T I_t L_t = \\frac{x \\cdot 10v}{x} = 10v $$\nThis is the empirical, or realized, Expected Shortfall. The ratio $M$ is then:\n$$ M = \\frac{10v}{v} = 10 $$\nThis result, which is constant across all test cases, reveals the model's critical flaw. When a violation occurs, the resulting loss is, on average, $10$ times greater than the $VaR$ threshold. A simple coverage test is blind to this systematic and severe underestimation of risk in the tail of the loss distribution. This demonstrates the superiority of a coherent risk measure like $ES$, which considers not only the frequency but also the severity of tail losses.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of demonstrating VaR backtesting limitations.\n    For each test case, it computes the Kupiec test result and the realized ES ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # (T, alpha, v)\n        (1000, 0.01, 1.0),\n        (250, 0.04, 2.0),\n        (200, 0.055, 0.5),\n        (20, 0.1, 3.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    significance_level = 0.05\n\n    for T, alpha, v in test_cases:\n        # Per problem statement, x = alpha * T is an integer for all test cases.\n        # This setup is deterministic.\n        x = int(T * alpha)\n        \n        # 1.

A forecast is only legitimate if it uses information that was available at the time of forecasting; using data from the period you are forecasting creates a \"ghost feature\" that leads to spuriously excellent performance. In this simulation [@problem_id:2374186], you will quantify this deceptive effect by comparing a properly specified model to one with look-ahead bias, offering a vital lesson in data integrity and honest model evaluation.", "problem": "You will implement and compare two rolling Gaussian risk models for Value-at-Risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) and quantify how the inclusion of \"ghost features\" (information from the future) affects standard backtesting outcomes. All computations are to be performed on synthetic return series generated from a specified conditional heteroskedastic process. Your program must be self-contained, produce deterministic results, and output a single list of floats as specified below.\n\nDefinitions and assumptions:\n- Let $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ denote the tail probability level for VaR and expected shortfall.\n- The one-step-ahead return at time $t$ is $r_t$. Negative values represent losses.\n- Under the Gaussian model with zero conditional mean and conditional standard deviation $\\sigma_t$, the $\\alpha$-quantile (left tail) is $q_\\alpha = \\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)$, where $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$ is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. The conditional VaR forecast is $\\widehat{\\text{VaR}}_t = q_\\alpha \\sigma_t$.\n- The expected shortfall is the conditional expectation in the tail. For a standard normal random variable $Z$, the truncated mean satisfies $\\mathbb{E}[Z \\mid Z \\le q_\\alpha] = -\\varphi(q_\\alpha)/\\alpha$, where $\\varphi(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal probability density function. Hence the ES forecast is $\\widehat{\\text{ES}}_t = \\sigma_t \\, \\mathbb{E}[Z \\mid Z \\le q_\\alpha] = -\\sigma_t \\, \\varphi(q_\\alpha)/\\alpha$.\n- Backtesting the VaR uses exceedance indicators $I_t = \\mathbf{1}\\{r_t  \\widehat{\\text{VaR}}_t\\}$. Unconditional coverage under correct calibration implies that $I_t$ are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli with success probability $\\alpha$. Over a backtest sample of length $n$, let $x = \\sum_{t=1}^n I_t$ denote the number of exceedances. The likelihood ratio statistic for the unconditional coverage hypothesis equals\n$$\n\\text{LR}_{\\text{uc}} = 2\\left[ x \\ln\\left(\\frac{x/n}{\\alpha}\\right) + (n-x)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x/n}{1-\\alpha}\\right)\\right],\n$$\nwith the conventions that $x \\ln(x/n)$ is $0$ when $x=0$ and $(n-x)\\ln(1 - x/n)$ is $0$ when $x=n$. Under the null hypothesis, $\\text{LR}_{\\text{uc}}$ is asymptotically $\\chi^2$ distributed with $1$ degree of freedom. The empirical hit rate is $\\widehat{p} = x/n$.\n- A strictly consistent scoring function for quantiles at level $\\alpha$ is the \"check loss\" $\\ell_t^{Q} = \\left(\\alpha - I_t\\right)\\left(r_t - \\widehat{\\text{VaR}}_t\\right)$, whose sample average $\\overline{\\ell}^{Q}$ should be small for well-calibrated quantile forecasts.\n- A simple ES backtesting diagnostic compares the realized tail conditional mean to the average ES forecast on exceedance days. Define the realized shortfall as $\\overline{r}_{\\text{tail}} = \\frac{1}{x}\\sum_{t: I_t=1} r_t$ (defined only if $x \\ge 1$) and the corresponding mean ES forecast on exceedance days as $\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail}} = \\frac{1}{x}\\sum_{t: I_t=1} \\widehat{\\text{ES}}_t$. The absolute ES bias is $|\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail}} - \\overline{r}_{\\text{tail}}|$.\n\nModels to compare:\n- Baseline model (proper chronology): At time $t$, estimate $\\sigma_t$ using the sample standard deviation over a rolling window of length $W$ from the $W$ most recent past returns $\\{r_{t-W},\\dots,r_{t-1}\\}$.\n- Ghost-feature model (look-ahead bias): At time $t$, erroneously estimate $\\sigma_t$ using a rolling window that includes the current return, namely $\\{r_{t-W+1},\\dots,r_t\\}$. This uses future information relative to the decision point, which is forbidden in genuine forecasting, but here is intentionally included to quantify its impact.\n\nData generating process:\n- Returns are generated by a Gaussian Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH($1,1$)) process with zero conditional mean:\n$$\n\\sigma_t^2 = \\omega + \\alpha_G r_{t-1}^2 + \\beta_G \\sigma_{t-1}^2,\\quad r_t = \\sigma_t \\, z_t,\\quad z_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1),\n$$\nwith given parameters $\\omega  0$, $\\alpha_G \\ge 0$, and $\\beta_G \\ge 0$ satisfying $\\alpha_G + \\beta_G  1$ for covariance stationarity. When $\\alpha_G = 0$ and $\\beta_G = 0$, this reduces to independent and identically distributed Gaussian returns with variance $\\omega$. Initialize $\\sigma_0^2$ at the unconditional variance $\\omega/(1 - \\alpha_G - \\beta_G)$ when $\\alpha_G + \\beta_G  1$, and otherwise at $\\omega$ for numerical stability.\n\nBacktesting metrics to compute for each model:\n- Hit-rate absolute error: $|\\widehat{p} - \\alpha|$.\n- Unconditional coverage likelihood ratio statistic: $\\text{LR}_{\\text{uc}}$.\n- Average quantile check loss: $\\overline{\\ell}^{Q}$.\n- Absolute ES bias: $|\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail}} - \\overline{r}_{\\text{tail}}|$.\n\nRequired comparison outputs:\nFor each test case below, compute the following four differences (baseline minus ghost), in this order:\n$D_1 =$ hit-rate absolute error reduction $= |\\widehat{p}_{\\text{base}} - \\alpha| - |\\widehat{p}_{\\text{ghost}} - \\alpha|$,\n$D_2 =$ unconditional coverage likelihood ratio reduction $= \\text{LR}_{\\text{uc, base}} - \\text{LR}_{\\text{uc, ghost}}$,\n$D_3 =$ quantile check-loss reduction $= \\overline{\\ell}^{Q}_{\\text{base}} - \\overline{\\ell}^{Q}_{\\text{ghost}}$,\n$D_4 =$ ES absolute-bias reduction $= |\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail, base}} - \\overline{r}_{\\text{tail, base}}| - |\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail, ghost}} - \\overline{r}_{\\text{tail, ghost}}|$.\n\nA positive value of any $D_j$ indicates that the ghost-feature model appears \"better\" by that metric, which would be spurious because it illegitimately uses future information.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement the four test cases below. For each, simulate the returns with the provided pseudo-random number generator seed to ensure determinism, then compute the metrics with a rolling window of length $W$ and level $\\alpha$ as specified. All $\\alpha$ values must be treated as decimals, not percentages.\n\n- Case A (heteroskedastic, strong persistence): $T = 4000$, $\\omega = 10^{-6}$, $\\alpha_G = 0.05$, $\\beta_G = 0.94$, $W = 250$, $\\alpha = 0.01$, seed $= 1729$.\n- Case B (heteroskedastic, moderate persistence, shorter sample): $T = 2000$, $\\omega = 10^{-6}$, $\\alpha_G = 0.15$, $\\beta_G = 0.80$, $W = 100$, $\\alpha = 0.05$, seed $= 2718$.\n- Case C (independent and identically distributed Gaussian, edge case): $T = 4000$, $\\omega = 10^{-4}$, $\\alpha_G = 0.00$, $\\beta_G = 0.00$, $W = 250$, $\\alpha = 0.01$, seed $= 3141$.\n- Case D (boundary: small window): $T = 1500$, $\\omega = 10^{-6}$, $\\alpha_G = 0.10$, $\\beta_G = 0.85$, $W = 30$, $\\alpha = 0.02$, seed $= 1618$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of $16$ floats enclosed in square brackets, ordered as $[D_{1,A},D_{2,A},D_{3,A},D_{4,A},D_{1,B},D_{2,B},D_{3,B},D_{4,B},D_{1,C},D_{2,C},D_{3,C},D_{4,C},D_{1,D},D_{2,D},D_{3,D},D_{4,D}]$, where the subscript denotes the test case. Each float must be rounded to $6$ decimal places. No other text may be printed.\n\nNumerical notes:\n- The rolling standard deviation should use the unbiased sample variance with denominator $(W-1)$.\n- When computing the truncated-normal quantities, use $q_\\alpha = \\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)$ and $\\mathbb{E}[Z \\mid Z \\le q_\\alpha] = -\\varphi(q_\\alpha)/\\alpha$.\n- The unconditional coverage likelihood ratio $\\text{LR}_{\\text{uc}}$ uses the conventions stated above for $x=0$ or $x=n$ to avoid undefined logarithms.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of financial econometrics, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of requirements for a computational experiment comparing two risk models. The objective is to quantify the impact of look-ahead bias (\"ghost features\") on standard backtesting metrics for Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).\n\nThe solution will be developed in four sequential stages:\n1.  Simulation of financial return data from a specified GARCH($1$,$1$) process.\n2.  Implementation of the two rolling-window volatility models: a properly specified baseline model and a flawed ghost-feature model.\n3.  Computation of VaR and ES forecasts, followed by the calculation of four distinct backtesting performance metrics for each model.\n4.  Calculation of the differences in these metrics between the two models to quantify the spurious performance improvement gained from look-ahead bias.\n\n**Stage 1: Data Generating Process**\n\nThe synthetic return series $\\{r_t\\}$ is generated from a Gaussian GARCH($1$,$1$) process. The conditional variance $\\sigma_t^2$ and return $r_t$ are given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_t^2 = \\omega + \\alpha_G r_{t-1}^2 + \\beta_G \\sigma_{t-1}^2\n$$\n$$\nr_t = \\sigma_t z_t, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad z_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1) \\quad \\text{i.i.d.}\n$$\nThe process is initialized at time $t=0$. For a stationary process, where $\\alpha_G + \\beta_G  1$, the initial variance $\\sigma_0^2$ is set to the unconditional variance $\\sigma^2 = \\omega / (1 - \\alpha_G - \\beta_G)$. If $\\alpha_G + \\beta_G \\ge 1$, $\\sigma_0^2$ is set to $\\omega$.\nA series of $T$ returns, $\\{r_0, r_1, \\dots, r_{T-1}\\}$, is generated for each test case using a specific pseudo-random number generator seed to ensure deterministic and reproducible results.\n\n**Stage 2: Risk Model Specification and Forecasting**\n\nTwo models are used to forecast the one-step-ahead conditional standard deviation, $\\sigma_t$. The forecasts are performed over a backtesting period from $t=W$ to $t=T-1$, where $W$ is the rolling window size, for a total of $n = T-W$ observations. Both models estimate $\\sigma_t$ using the unbiased sample standard deviation (denominator $W-1$) of returns in a rolling window.\n\n- **Baseline Model (Proper Chronology):** The forecast for time $t$, denoted $\\sigma_{t, \\text{base}}$, is computed using the $W$ most recent *past* returns available at time $t-1$:\n$$ \\sigma_{t, \\text{base}} = \\text{StDev}(\\{r_{t-W}, r_{t-W+1}, \\dots, r_{t-1}\\}) $$\n- **Ghost-Feature Model (Look-Ahead Bias):** The forecast for time $t$, denoted $\\sigma_{t, \\text{ghost}}$, is computed using a window that erroneously includes the current return $r_t$:\n$$ \\sigma_{t, \\text{ghost}} = \\text{StDev}(\\{r_{t-W+1}, r_{t-W+2}, \\dots, r_t\\}) $$\n\nFor a given tail probability $\\alpha$, the VaR and ES forecasts for model $m \\in \\{\\text{base, ghost}\\}$ are:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{VaR}}_{t,m} = q_\\alpha \\sigma_{t,m}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad q_\\alpha = \\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha) $$\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{ES}}_{t,m} = -\\frac{\\varphi(q_\\alpha)}{\\alpha} \\sigma_{t,m} $$\nHere, $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$ is the inverse CDF (quantile function) and $\\varphi(\\cdot)$ is the PDF of the standard normal distribution. The constants $q_\\alpha$ and the multiplier for ES are pre-calculated for efficiency.\n\n**Stage 3: Backtesting Metrics**\n\nFor each model, we evaluate the quality of its forecasts using four metrics over the backtest sample of size $n=T-W$. A VaR exceedance is recorded when $r_t  \\widehat{\\text{VaR}}_t$, indicated by $I_t = \\mathbf{1}\\{r_t  \\widehat{\\text{VaR}}_t\\}$. The total number of exceedances is $x = \\sum_{i=1}^n I_t$.\n\n1.  **Hit-rate absolute error:** Measures the deviation of the empirical exceedance frequency $\\widehat{p} = x/n$ from the target level $\\alpha$:\n$$ |\\widehat{p} - \\alpha| $$\n2.  **Unconditional coverage likelihood ratio ($\\text{LR}_{\\text{uc}}$):** Tests the hypothesis that $\\mathbb{E}[I_t] = \\alpha$. The statistic is:\n$$ \\text{LR}_{\\text{uc}} = 2\\left[ x \\ln\\left(\\frac{x/n}{\\alpha}\\right) + (n-x)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x/n}{1-\\alpha}\\right)\\right] $$\nThe specified conventions for $x=0$ or $x=n$ are strictly followed to handle logarithmic terms.\n3.  **Average quantile check loss ($\\overline{\\ell}^{Q}$):** A strictly consistent scoring function for quantiles. Lower values are better.\n$$ \\overline{\\ell}^{Q} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^{n} (\\alpha - I_t)(r_t - \\widehat{\\text{VaR}}_t) $$\n4.  **Absolute ES bias:** Measures the discrepancy between the average forecasted ES on exceedance days and the average realized return on those same days.\n$$ |\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail}} - \\overline{r}_{\\text{tail}}| $$\nwhere $\\overline{r}_{\\text{tail}} = \\frac{1}{x}\\sum_{t: I_t=1} r_t$ and $\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail}} = \\frac{1}{x}\\sum_{t: I_t=1} \\widehat{\\text{ES}}_t$. If $x=0$ (no exceedances), the bias is defined to be $0$, as there are no tail events to evaluate.\n\n**Stage 4: Comparative Analysis and Final Output**\n\nThe core of the analysis is the direct comparison of the two models. For each of the four test cases (A, B, C, D), we compute the four metrics for both the baseline and ghost-feature models. The final required outputs are the differences in these metrics, calculated as (baseline metric) - (ghost metric):\n\n- $D_1 = |\\widehat{p}_{\\text{base}} - \\alpha| - |\\widehat{p}_{\\text{ghost}} - \\alpha|$\n- $D_2 = \\text{LR}_{\\text{uc, base}} - \\text{LR}_{\\text{uc, ghost}}$\n- $D_3 = \\overline{\\ell}^{Q}_{\\text{base}} - \\overline{\\ell}^{Q}_{\\text{ghost}}$\n- $D_4 = |\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail, base}} - \\overline{r}_{\\text{tail, base}}| - |\\overline{\\widehat{\\text{ES}}}_{\\text{tail, ghost}} - \\overline{r}_{\\text{tail, ghost}}|$\n\nA positive value for any $D_j$ indicates a spurious improvement in the performance of the ghost-feature model due to its use of future information.
