Initially, all centers except A are unconfirmed, with their costs set to infinity, while A's cost is 0.

Then apply your derived modification to the graph above to determine the total number of distinct shortest $s$-$t$ paths. Assume arbitrary tie-breaking in the PQ; the count must be independent of tie-breaking. Express your final answer as a single real-valued number with no units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "We begin with the core definitions. A weighted directed graph $(V,E,w)$ has a set of vertices $V$, a set of directed edges $E \\subseteq V \\times V$, and a nonnegative weight function $w : E \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$. For a path $P = \\langle v_{0}, v_{1}, \\dots, v_{k} \\rangle$ with $(v_{i}, v_{i+1}) \\in E$ for all $i$, its length is $\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w(v_{i}, v_{i+1})$. The shortest-path distance from $s$ to $x$, denoted $d^{\\ast}(x)$, is $\\min\\{\\text{length}(P) : P \\text{ is an } s\\text{-}x \\text{ path}\\}$.\n\nDijkstra’s algorithm maintains a tentative distance array $d[v]$, initializing $d[s] = 0$ and $d[v] = \\infty$ for $v \\neq s$, and a priority queue (PQ) keyed by $d[v]$. A fundamental invariant is: when a vertex $u$ is extracted from the PQ, $d[u] = d^{\\ast}(u)$, and no future relaxation can decrease $d[u]$ because all edge weights are nonnegative.\n\nTo count the number of distinct shortest paths, we augment Dijkstra’s algorithm with a path-count array $c[v]$ where $c[v]$ denotes the number of distinct shortest $s$-$v$ paths consistent with the current best known distance $d[v]$. The initialization is $c[s] = 1$ (there is exactly one empty path of length $0$ to itself), and $c[v] = 0$ for $v \\neq s$. When relaxing an edge $(u,v)$ with weight $w(u,v)$, we consider the candidate distance $d[u] + w(u,v)$:\n- If $d[u] + w(u,v)  d[v]$, then we have found a strictly shorter $s$-$v$ path. Set $d[v] \\leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$ and reset $c[v] \\leftarrow c[u]$ because every shortest $s$-$v$ path must now end by $(u,v)$ and consist of a shortest $s$-$u$ path followed by this edge.\n- If $d[u] + w(u,v) = d[v]$, then we have found additional shortest $s$-$v$ paths of equal minimal length. Add $c[u]$ to $c[v]$, that is, $c[v] \\leftarrow c[v] + c[u]$, because each shortest $s$-$u$ path can be extended by $(u,v)$ to yield a distinct shortest $s$-$v$ path.\n\nCorrectness is justified by induction over the order in which vertices are extracted from the PQ. The base case is $s$, with $d[s] = 0 = d^{\\ast}(s)$ and $c[s] = 1$. Assume that for all previously extracted vertices $u$, we have $d[u] = d^{\\ast}(u)$ and $c[u]$ equals the count of distinct shortest $s$-$u$ paths. For a relaxation $(u,v)$, if a strictly better distance is found, all previous shortest $s$-$v$ paths become non-shortest, so resetting $c[v]$ to $c[u]$ is necessary and sufficient, because any shortest $s$-$v$ path must pass through some predecessor $u$ extracted earlier with finalized $d[u]$, and then the last edge $(u,v)$; nonnegative weights ensure this structure is acyclic in the final shortest-path DAG when distances are finalized. If an equally short distance is found, paths via $u$ are new shortest $s$-$v$ paths distinct from those already counted for $v$, so addition accumulates the correct total. When $t$ is extracted or all relaxations are complete, $d[t] = d^{\\ast}(t)$ and $c[t]$ equals the number of distinct shortest $s$-$t$ paths.\n\nWe now apply this modification to the given graph.

The algorithm terminates with $d[t] = 9$, which is the shortest-path distance from $s$ to $t$, and $c[t] = 6$, the total number of distinct shortest $s$-$t$ paths.\n\nWe can cross-check the path structure to ensure no overcounting:\n- Paths via $e$ directly to $t$: from $s$ to $e$ there are $2$ shortest routes ($s \\to b \\to e$ and $s \\to c \\to e$), each extended by $(e,t)$ yields $2$ distinct shortest paths of total length $4 + 5 = 9$.\n- Paths via $f$ directly to $t$: the unique shortest route to $f$ is $s \\to d \\to f$ (length $3 + 1 = 4$); extending by $(f,t)$ yields $1$ shortest path of length $9$.\n- Paths via $g$ to $t$: to $g$ there are $3$ shortest routes (two via $e$ and one via $f$), each extended by $(g,t)$ yields $3$ distinct shortest paths of length $6 + 3 = 9$.\nSumming $2 + 1 + 3 = 6$ agrees with $c[t] = 6$ produced by the algorithm.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ in the given graph is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "3227957"}]}
