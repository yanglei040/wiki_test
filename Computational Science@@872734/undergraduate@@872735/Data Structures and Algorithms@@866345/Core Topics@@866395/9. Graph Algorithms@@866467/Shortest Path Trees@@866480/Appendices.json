A path is defined as feasible if its internal vertices do not belong to the set $V_{bad} = \\{c, f\\}$. The problem also specifies that the endpoints $s$ and $t$ are not in $V_{bad}$. This means that any feasible path from $s$ to $t$ must consist entirely of vertices from the set $V' = V \\setminus V_{bad}$. Therefore, finding the shortest feasible path in the original graph $G$ is equivalent to finding the shortest path in the subgraph of $G$ induced by the vertex set $V'$.\n\nLet this reduced graph be $G' = (V', E')$.\nThe vertex set $V'$ is:\n$V' = V \\setminus V_{bad} = \\{s, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, t\\} \\setminus \\{c, f\\} = \\{s, a, b, d, e, g, h, t\\}$.\n\nThe edge set $E'$ consists of all edges $(u, v) \\in E$ such that both $u$ and $v$ are in $V'$. We filter the original edge list:\n-   $(s, a, 2)$: Valid, since $s, a \\in V'$.\n-   $(s, b, 5)$: Valid, since $s, b \\in V'$.\n-   $(s, h, 15)$: Valid, since $s, h \\in V'$.\n-   $(s, c, 1)$: Invalid, since $c \\notin V'$.\n-   $(a, c, 2)$: Invalid, since $c \\notin V'$.\n-   $(a, d, 4)$: Valid, since $a, d \\in V'$.\n-   $(a, e, 7)$: Valid, since $a, e \\in V'$.\n-   $(b, a, 1)$: Valid, since $b, a \\in V'$.\n-   $(b, d, 2)$: Valid, since $b, d \\in V'$.\n-   $(b, f, 6)$: Invalid, since $f \\notin V'$.\n-   $(c, d, 2)$: Invalid, since $c \\notin V'$.\n-   $(c, g, 5)$: Invalid, since $c \\notin V'$.\n-   $(d, e, 1)$: Valid, since $d, e \\in V'$.\n-   $(d, f, 2)$: Invalid, since $f \\notin V'$.\n-   $(d, g, 6)$: Valid, since $d, g \\in V'$.\n-   $(e, g, 1)$: Valid, since $e, g \\in V'$.\n-   $(e, h, 3)$: Valid, since $e, h \\in V'$.\n-   $(f, t, 3)$: Invalid, since $f \\notin V'$.\n-   $(g, h, 2)$: Valid, since $g, h \\in V'$.\n-   $(g, t, 4)$: Valid, since $g, t \\in V'$.\n-   $(h, t, 2)$: Valid, since $h, t \\in V'$.\n\nThe resulting graph $G' = (V', E')$ has weights that are all non-negative.

The problem is valid as it is mathematically and algorithmically sound, self-contained, and devoid of ambiguity. I will first derive a method to solve this class of problems by reducing it to a standard single-source shortest path problem, and then apply this method to the specific instance provided.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Reduction\nLet the directed graph be $G=(V,E)$, with a nonnegative edge weight function $w:E\\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ and a nonnegative vertex cost function $c:V\\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$. For a given source vertex $s \\in V$ and destination vertex $t \\in V$, we are asked to find a path $P=\\langle s=x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_k=t\\rangle$ that minimizes the path cost, defined as:\n$$\nC(P) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w(x_i,x_{i+1}) \\;+\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} c(x_i)\n$$\nThis cost is the sum of all edge weights along the path, plus the sum of the costs of all intermediate vertices (i.e., excluding the source $s$ and the destination $t$).\n\nStandard shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, operate on graphs where costs are associated only with edges. Our goal is to transform the given problem into an equivalent one on a graph with only edge weights, such that the standard shortest path cost in the new graph is directly related to the custom cost $C(P)$.\n\nLet us construct a new graph $G'=(V, E)$ having the same set of vertices and edges as $G$. We need to define a new edge weight function $w': E \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$. The key is to incorporate the vertex costs into these new edge weights. A vertex cost $c(v)$ is incurred when a path passes through $v$. This suggests that the cost $c(v)$ can be added to the weight of every edge entering $v$ or every edge leaving $v$.\n\nLet us explore the first approach: defining the new weight of an edge $(u,v)$ as the sum of its original weight and the cost of its destination vertex $v$.\nLet $w'(u,v) = w(u,v) + c(v)$ for every edge $(u,v) \\in E$.\nSince $w(u,v) \\ge 0$ and $c(v) \\ge 0$, the new edge weights $w'(u,v)$ are also all nonnegative. This ensures that Dijkstra's algorithm is applicable to the transformed graph $G'$.\n\nNow, let's consider the cost of the same path $P = \\langle s=x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_k=t\\rangle$ in this new graph $G'$, according to the standard shortest path metric. This cost, let's call it $C'(P)$, is the sum of the new edge weights along the path:\n$$\nC'(P) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w'(x_i,x_{i+1})\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $w'$, we have:\n$$\nC'(P) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\left( w(x_i,x_{i+1}) + c(x_{i+1}) \\right)\n$$\nWe can split this sum into two parts:\n$$\nC'(P) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w(x_i,x_{i+1}) + \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c(x_{i+1})\n$$\nLet's expand the second summation:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c(x_{i+1}) = c(x_1) + c(x_2) + \\dots + c(x_{k-1}) + c(x_k)\n$$\nThe first part of this sum, $\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} c(x_i)$, corresponds to the costs of the intermediate vertices. The vertex $x_k$ is the destination vertex $t$. So, we can rewrite the expression for $C'(P)$ as:\n$$\nC'(P) = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w(x_i,x_{i+1}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} c(x_i) \\right) + c(x_k)\n$$\nThe expression in parentheses is precisely the original cost function $C(P)$. Since $x_k = t$, we have:\n$$\nC'(P) = C(P) + c(t)\n$$\nThis relationship shows that for any path from $s$ to $t$, the standard cost in $G'$ is equal to the custom cost in $G$ plus the cost of the destination vertex, $c(t)$. Since $c(t)$ is a constant for all paths from $s$ to $t$, the path that minimizes $C'(P)$ is the same path that minimizes $C(P)$.\n\nTherefore, we can find the minimum path cost in the original problem by performing the following steps:\n1. Construct the graph $G'$ with edge weights $w'(u,v) = w(u,v) + c(v)$.\n2. Run Dijkstra's algorithm on $G'$ starting from source $s$ to find the shortest path distance to all other vertices. Let $d'(s,v)$ denote this distance for any vertex $v$.\n3. The shortest path distance from $s$ to $t$ in $G'$ is $d'(s,t)$.\n4.

This advanced practice explores how to efficiently update an existing Shortest Path Tree (SPT) when an edge weight decreases. By understanding the properties of shortest paths, you can develop an update procedure that is much faster than a full re-computation, a concept at the heart of dynamic graph algorithms [@problem_id:3270914].", "problem": "Consider a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with nonnegative edge weights given by a function $w : E \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$, and a distinguished source vertex $s \\in V$. A Shortest Path Tree (SPT) is defined as a predecessor map $\\pi : V \\to V \\cup \\{\\text{nil}\\}$ such that the directed edges $\\{(\\pi(v), v) : v \\in V, \\pi(v) \\neq \\text{nil}\\}$ form a directed spanning tree rooted at $s$ and the associated path distances $d : V \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ satisfy that for each vertex $v \\in V$, the path from $s$ to $v$ in this tree has total weight exactly $d(v)$ and equals the minimum possible among all $s \\to v$ directed paths.\n\nThe objective is to design and implement a program that, given an SPT for $G$ with respect to $s$, updates this SPT after the weight of a single directed edge $(u, v) \\in E$ decreases to a new value $w'(u, v)$ satisfying $0 \\le w'(u, v)  w(u, v)$, without performing a full recomputation from scratch. The update should rely on fundamental properties of shortest paths and the behavior of relaxation with nonnegative weights, and must operate by re-using the existing distances $d(\\cdot)$ and predecessors $\\pi(\\cdot)$ rather than reinitializing all structures as if no information were known. The updated SPT must reflect the new shortest path distances $d'(\\cdot)$ and an updated predecessor map $\\pi'(\\cdot)$.\n\nFundamental base for derivation:\n- Definition of shortest path distances with nonnegative weights.\n- Optimal substructure of shortest paths: if a path from $s$ to $y$ is shortest, then any prefix from $s$ to any intermediate vertex $x$ is also shortest.\n- Relaxation invariants: for any edge $(x, y) \\in E$, the inequality $d(y) \\le d(x) + w(x, y)$ must hold in a valid SPT; when an edge weight decreases, only vertices whose shortest path can be improved by traversing this edge or paths reachable from its head may change.\n\nYour program must compute initial shortest path distances from $s$ using a correct algorithm for nonnegative weights, then apply a single-edge decrease update step using only localized relaxations seeded at $v$ if $d(u) + w'(u, v)  d(v)$, and propagate improvements to affected vertices via a min-priority queue until no improvement is possible. The program must not re-run a full computation starting from scratch.\n\nYour program must be self-contained and must not read input. Use the following test suite, where each test case is specified by the number of vertices, an edge list with weights, a source vertex, and a single edge weight decrease specified by $(u, v, w')$. Vertices are indexed by integers starting at $0$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test case $1$: $|V| = 6$, $s = 0$, edges given as the list of triples $(x, y, w)$:\n  $(0, 1, 7)$, $(0, 2, 9)$, $(0, 5, 14)$, $(1, 2, 10)$, $(1, 3, 15)$, $(2, 3, 11)$, $(2, 5, 2)$, $(3, 4, 6)$, $(5, 4, 9)$.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of graph theory and algorithm design, specifically concerning single-source shortest paths in directed graphs with non-negative edge weights. The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective, all necessary data provided, and no internal contradictions. It asks for the implementation of a standard and efficient algorithm for updating a Shortest Path Tree (SPT) after a single edge weight decrease, which is a non-trivial but well-understood task in computer science.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages: first, the computation of an initial Shortest Path Tree, and second, the incremental update of this tree after an edge weight decreases.\n\n### 1. Initial Shortest Path Tree Computation\n\nGiven a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, a non-negative weight function $w : E \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$, and a source vertex $s \\in V$, the single-source shortest path problem is to find, for every vertex $v \\in V$, the path from $s$ to $v$ with the minimum total weight. The weight of such a path is denoted by $d(v)$.\n\nSince all edge weights are non-negative, Dijkstra's algorithm is the canonical and most efficient method for this task. The algorithm maintains a set of vertices whose shortest path from the source is already finalized. It iteratively selects a vertex $u$ which is not yet finalized and has the smallest known distance from $s$. Once selected, $u$ is considered finalized, and all its outgoing edges $(u, v)$ are \"relaxed\": if a shorter path to any neighbor $v$ is found through $u$ (i.e., if $d(u) + w(u, v)  d(v)$), the distance $d(v)$ and predecessor $\\pi(v)$ are updated. A min-priority queue is typically used to efficiently select the vertex with the minimum distance at each step.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize a distance array $d$ such that $d(s) = 0$ and $d(v) = \\infty$ for all $v \\neq s$.\n2. Initialize a predecessor array $\\pi$ such that $\\pi(v) = \\text{nil}$ for all $v \\in V$.\n3. Initialize a min-priority queue $Q$ with all vertices, using the values in $d$ as keys.\n4. While $Q$ is not empty:\n   a. Extract the vertex $u$ with the minimum distance from $Q$.\n   b. For each vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$ (i.e., for each edge $(u, v) \\in E$):\n      i. perform the relaxation operation: if $d(u) + w(u, v)  d(v)$, then update $d(v) \\leftarrow d(u) + w(u, v)$ and $\\pi(v) \\leftarrow u$. The priority queue $Q$ must be updated to reflect the new distance for $v$.\n\nUpon termination, $d(v)$ will hold the shortest path distance from $s$ to $v$ for all $v \\in V$, and $\\pi$ will define the SPT.\n\n### 2. Updating the Shortest Path Tree after an Edge Weight Decrease\n\nLet us assume we have an existing SPT, represented by the distance array $d$ and predecessor map $\\pi$. We are given that the weight of a single edge $(u, v) \\in E$ decreases from $w(u, v)$ to $w'(u, v)$, where $0 \\le w'(u, v)  w(u, v)$.\n\nAn essential property of shortest paths on graphs with non-negative weights is that a decrease in an edge weight can only potentially decrease the shortest path distances to other vertices; it can never cause an increase. All previously computed shortest paths remain valid paths, although they may no longer be the shortest.\n\nThe update to the SPT is triggered only if the modified edge $(u, v)$ provides a shorter path to vertex $v$ than was previously known. The new potential path to $v$ goes from $s$ to $u$ (with cost $d(u)$) and then across the modified edge $(u, v)$ (with cost $w'(u, v)$). The condition for an improvement is thus:\n$$d(u) + w'(u, v)  d(v)$$\n\n- If this condition is **false**, the old shortest path to $v$ is still better than or equal to any new path through the modified edge $(u, v)$. Consequently, the shortest paths to all other vertices are also unaffected, and the SPT remains unchanged. The new distances $d'$ are identical to the old distances $d$.\n\n- If the condition is **true**, we have found a new shortest path to vertex $v$. We must update its distance and predecessor:\n$$d'(v) \\leftarrow d(u) + w'(u, v)$$\n$$\\pi'(v) \\leftarrow u$$\nThis improvement in the distance to $v$ may, in turn, create shorter paths to vertices reachable from $v$. For any neighbor $z$ of $v$, the path $s \\to \\dots \\to u \\to v \\to z$ might now be shorter than the existing shortest path to $z$.\n\nThis propagation of distance improvements is structurally identical to the process of Dijkstra's algorithm itself. Therefore, we can perform an efficient, localized update. Instead of re-running Dijkstra's algorithm from the source $s$ on the entire graph, we can initiate a Dijkstra-like procedure starting only from the vertex $v$ whose distance was first improved.\n\nThe update algorithm is as follows:\n1. Let the initial SPT be given by distances $d$ and predecessors $\\pi$.\n2. Let the weight of edge $(u, v)$ decrease to $w'(u, v)$. Update the graph's internal representation of this weight.\n3. Check the trigger condition. If $d(u) + w'(u, v)  d(v)$:\n   a. Update the distance array: $d(v) \\leftarrow d(u) + w'(u, v)$.\n   b. Update the predecessor array: $\\pi(v) \\leftarrow u$.\n   c. Initialize a min-priority queue $Q_{update}$ and insert $v$ into it.\n   d. While $Q_{update}$ is not empty:\n      i. Extract the vertex $x$ with the minimum distance from $Q_{update}$.\n      ii. For each neighbor $y$ of $x$, relax the edge $(x, y)$: if $d(x) + w(x, y)  d(y)$, update $d(y) \\leftarrow d(x) + w(x, y)$, set $\\pi(y) \\leftarrow x$, and add or update $y$ in $Q_{update}$ with its new, lower distance.\n4. If the trigger condition in step $3$ is not met, no changes are needed. The final distance array $d'$ is the (now updated) array $d$.\n\nThis procedure is more efficient than a full recomputation because it only processes vertices whose shortest paths are actually affected by the edge weight decrease.\n\n### Application to Test Cases\n\nLet's apply this logic to Test Case $1$: $|V| = 6$, $s = 0$, edges $\\{(0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 9), (0, 5, 14), (1, 2, 10), (1, 3, 15), (2, 3, 11), (2, 5, 2), (3, 4, 6), (5, 4, 9)\\}$.\n1.  **Initial Dijkstra**: The initial shortest path distances from $s=0$ are calculated as $d = [0, 7, 9, 20, 20, 11]$.\n2.  **Edge Decrease**: The weight of edge $(1, 2)$ decreases to $w'(1, 2) = 1$.\n3.  **Update**:\n    a. Check condition: $d(1) + w'(1, 2)  d(2)$ becomes $7 + 1  9$, which is $8  9$. The condition is true.\n    b. Update $d(2) \\leftarrow 8$. Initialize $Q_{update}$ with vertex $2$.\n    c. Extract $2$ (cost $8$). Relax its outgoing edges:\n       - $(2, 3)$: $d(2) + w(2, 3) = 8 + 11 = 19$. Since $19  d(3)=20$, update $d(3) \\leftarrow 19$ and add $3$ to $Q_{update}$.\n       - $(2, 5)$: $d(2) + w(2, 5) = 8 + 2 = 10$. Since $10  d(5)=11$, update $d(5) \\leftarrow 10$ and add $5$ to $Q_{update}$.\n    d. $Q_{update}$ now contains $\\{ (10, 5), (19, 3) \\}$. Extract $5$ (cost $10$). Relax its outgoing edge:\n       - $(5, 4)$: $d(5) + w(5, 4) = 10 + 9 = 19$. Since $19  d(4)=20$, update $d(4) \\leftarrow 19$ and add $4$ to $Q_{update}$.\n    e. $Q_{update}$ now contains $\\{ (19, 3), (19, 4) \\}$. Extract $3$ (cost $19$). Relax its outgoing edge:\n       - $(3, 4)$: $d(3) + w(3, 4) = 19 + 6 = 25$. Since $25 \\not d(4)=19$, no update.\n    f. Extract $4$ (cost $19$). No outgoing edges to relax.\n    g. $Q_{update}$ is empty. The process terminates.\n4.  **Final Distances**: The updated distance array is $d' = [0, 7, 8, 19, 19, 10]$.\n\nSimilar analyses yield the results for the other test cases. For Test Case $2$, the trigger condition is not met, so the distances remain unchanged.
