A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nWe are asked to find a tight asymptotic expression for $T(n)$ satisfying the recurrence relation $T(n) = 2T(n/3) + \\sqrt{n}$. We will use the recursion tree method to solve this from first principles.\n\nLet us assume the non-recursive cost is $c_1\\sqrt{n}$ for some constant $c_1  0$, and the base case is $T(1) = c_2$ for some constant $c_2  0$, which is consistent with $T(1) = \\Theta(1)$. The recurrence is $T(n) = 2T(n/3) + c_1\\sqrt{n}$.\n\nWe construct a recursion tree to visualize the work done.\nThe root of the tree represents the initial problem of size $n$. The non-recursive work done at the root is $c_1\\sqrt{n}$. This is level $0$.\nThe root generates $2$ subproblems, each of size $n/3$. These form level $1$ of the tree.\nAt level $i$ of the recursion tree (where the root is at level $0$), we have:\n- Number of nodes (subproblems): $2^i$.\n- Size of each subproblem: $n/3^i$.\n- Work done at each node (non-recursive part): $c_1\\sqrt{n/3^i} = c_1\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{(\\sqrt{3})^i}$.\n- Total work done across all nodes at level $i$: $W_i = 2^i \\times \\left(c_1\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{(\\sqrt{3})^i}\\right) = c_1\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^i$.\n\nThe recursion terminates when the subproblem size becomes $1$. Let $d$ be the depth of the tree. This occurs when $n/3^d = 1$, which implies $3^d = n$, so $d = \\log_3(n)$.\n\nThe total work $T(n)$ is the sum of the work done at all levels, from level $0$ to level $d$.\n$$ T(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d} W_i $$\nThis sum can be split into the sum of work at the internal nodes (levels $0$ to $d-1$) and the work at the leaf nodes (level $d$).\n\nThe work at the leaf level, $W_d$, corresponds to the base cases.\nAt level $d$, there are $2^d$ nodes, each corresponding to a problem of size $n/3^d = 1$. The work for each is $T(1) = c_2$.\nSo, the total work at the leaves is $W_{leaves} = 2^d \\cdot T(1) = c_2 \\cdot 2^d$.\nSince $d = \\log_3(n)$, we have $2^d = 2^{\\log_3(n)}$. Using the logarithm identity $a^{\\log_b(c)} = c^{\\log_b(a)}$, we get:\n$2^{\\log_3(n)} = n^{\\log_3(2)}$.\nThus, the work at the leaves is $W_{leaves} = c_2 n^{\\log_3(2)}$.\n\nThe work at the internal nodes is the sum from $i=0$ to $d-1$:\n$$ W_{internal} = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} W_i = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} c_1\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^i = c_1\\sqrt{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^i $$\nThis is a geometric series with ratio $r = 2/\\sqrt{3}$.

The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any principles of mathematics or computer science. Therefore, the problem statement is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Asymptotic Bounds\n\nThe provided recurrences are of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$. The asymptotic behavior of such recurrences can be determined using the Master Theorem. The theorem compares the function $f(n)$ to the term $n^{\\log_b a}$, which represents the rate of growth of the number of subproblems.\n\nFor both recurrences, we have $a=4$ and $b=2$. We compute the critical exponent:\n$$\n\\log_b a = \\log_2 4 = 2\n$$\nSo, for both problems, we will compare the non-recursive work term, $f(n)$, to $n^2$.\n\n**Analysis of $T_1(n)$:**\nThe recurrence is $T_1(n)=4\\,T_1(n/2)+n^{1.9}$.\nHere, $f_1(n) = n^{1.9}$.\nWe compare $f_1(n)$ with $n^{\\log_b a} = n^2$.\nThe exponent of $f_1(n)$ is $1.9$, which is less than the critical exponent $2$.\nSpecifically, $f_1(n) = n^{1.9} = O(n^{2 - \\epsilon})$ for some constant $\\epsilon  0$. For instance, we can choose $\\epsilon = 0.1$, which gives $n^{1.9} = O(n^{1.9})$.\nThis corresponds to **Case 1** of the Master Theorem, which states that if $f(n) = O(n^{\\log_b a - \\epsilon})$, then $T(n) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_b a})$.\nApplying this case, we conclude:\n$$\nT_1(n) = \\Theta(n^2)\n$$\nIn this situation, the growth is dominated by the cost at the leaves of the recursion tree.\n\n**Analysis of $T_2(n)$:**\nThe recurrence is $T_2(n)=4\\,T_2(n/2)+n^{2.1}$.\nHere, $f_2(n) = n^{2.1}$.\nWe compare $f_2(n)$ with $n^{\\log_b a} = n^2$.\nThe exponent of $f_2(n)$ is $2.1$, which is greater than the critical exponent $2$.\nSpecifically, $f_2(n) = n^{2.1} = \\Omega(n^{2 + \\epsilon})$ for some constant $\\epsilon  0$. For instance, we can choose $\\epsilon = 0.1$, which gives $n^{2.1} = \\Omega(n^{2.1})$.\nThis points to **Case 3** of the Master Theorem. For this case to apply, we must also satisfy the regularity condition: $a f(n/b) \\leq c f(n)$ for some constant $c  1$ and for all sufficiently large $n$.\nLet's verify this condition for $T_2(n)$:\n$$\na f_2(n/b) = 4 \\cdot (n/2)^{2.1} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{n^{2.1}}{2^{2.1}} = \\frac{4}{2^{2.1}} \\cdot n^{2.1}\n$$\nWe require a constant $c = \\frac{4}{2^{2.1}}  1$. Since $2^{2.1}  2^2 = 4$, the fraction $\\frac{4}{2^{2.1}}$ is indeed less than $1$. The regularity condition is satisfied.\nCase 3 of the Master Theorem states that if $f(n) = \\Omega(n^{\\log_b a + \\epsilon})$ and the regularity condition holds, then $T(n) = \\Theta(f(n))$.\nApplying this case, we conclude:\n$$\nT_2(n) = \\Theta(n^{2.1})\n$$\nIn this situation, the growth is dominated by the cost of the work at the root of the recursion tree.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- $T_1(n) = \\Theta(n^2)$\n- $T_2(n) = \\Theta(n^{2.1})$\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow I will evaluate each provided option based on the derived results.\n\n**A. $T_1(n)=\\Theta(n^{2})$ and $T_2(n)=\\Theta(n^{2.1})$, hence $T_2(n)$ asymptotically dominates $T_1(n)$.**\n- The statement $T_1(n)=\\Theta(n^2)$ is correct, as derived from Case 1 of the Master Theorem.\n- The statement $T_2(n)=\\Theta(n^{2.1})$ is correct, as derived from Case 3 of the Master Theorem.\n- The conclusion that \"$T_2(n)$ asymptotically dominates $T_1(n)$\" is also correct.
