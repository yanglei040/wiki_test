A function $f(n)$ is in $\\mathcal{O}(g(n))$ if and only if there exist constants $c \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}$ and $n_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all integers $n \\ge n_0$, the inequality $0 \\le |f(n)| \\le c \\cdot |g(n)|$ holds. For the functions in this problem, $f(n) = n$ and $g(n) = 1$, which are non-negative for $n \\ge 1$, we can simplify the inequality to $0 \\le n \\le c \\cdot 1$. The logical structure of the definition is crucial: $\\exists c  0, \\exists n_0 \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\forall n \\ge n_0, f(n) \\le c \\cdot g(n)$. This means the constants $c$ and $n_0$ must be chosen once and work for all values of $n$ beyond the threshold $n_0$. They cannot be functions of $n$.\n\nThe claim that $n \\in \\mathcal{O}(1)$ is false. For it to be true, there would need to exist a fixed constant $c$ such that $n \\le c$ for all sufficiently large $n$. This is impossible, as the function $f(n)=n$ is unbounded. The provided \"proof\" is therefore necessarily flawed. We will now analyze each step of the purported proof and then evaluate the given options.\n\nThe purported proof contains three distinct, flawed arguments:\n1.  **Argument 1**: \"for each $n \\ge 1$, pick $c = n$. Then $f(n) = n \\le c \\cdot 1$ holds\". This argument sets the constant $c$ to be equal to the variable $n$. This violates the quantifier order in the definition of $\\mathcal{O}$-notation. The constant $c$ must be independent of $n$.\n2.  **Argument 2**: \"$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n$ 'exists,' so the growth is 'well-behaved,' and therefore bounded by a constant...\". This argument is fallacious on multiple grounds. The limit $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n$ does not exist as a finite real number; it diverges to $\\infty$. A sufficient condition for $f(n) \\in \\mathcal{O}(g(n))$ is that $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{|f(n)|}{|g(n)|}  \\infty$. In this case, the limit is $\\infty$, which proves that $n \\notin \\mathcal{O}(1)$. The argument misinterprets the limit test and incorrectly states the limit \"exists\".\n3.  **Argument 3**: \"choose $n_0 = 10$; for all $n \\ge n_0$ we have $n \\le n_0$, so $f(n) \\le n_0 \\cdot 1$\". This argument contains a fundamental logical contradiction. The premise is that the statement holds for all $n \\ge n_0$. But the claimed inequality, $n \\le n_0$, is only true for $n=n_0$ and is false for all $n  n_0$. It is not true \"for all $n \\ge n_0$\". This misinterprets the role of $n_0$ as a lower threshold for $n$, treating it instead as an upper bound for $n$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The argument allows the constant $c$ to depend on $n$, using $c = n$, which violates the quantifier structure in the definition of $\\mathcal{O}$; the constant must be chosen independently of $n$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the error in the first argument of the purported proof. The definition requires $\\exists c$ such that $\\forall n \\ge n_0$. The proof attempts to use a structure equivalent to $\\forall n \\ge n_0, \\exists c$, which is a different logical statement and does not satisfy the definition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The use of the limit $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{1}$ to conclude $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is invalid; not only is this limit infinite, but existence of a limit does not by itself establish a uniform constant bound required by $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the error in the second argument. The limit $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n$ is $\\infty$, not a finite value. The fact that the limit of the ratio $\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}$ diverges to infinity is a proof that $f(n) \\notin \\mathcal{O}(g(n))$. The reasoning presented in the proof is entirely backwards.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The step asserting that for $n \\ge n_0$ one has $n \\le n_0$ reverses the inequality and misinterprets the role of $n_0$; $n_0$ is a threshold beyond which a bound must hold, not an upper bound for $n$ itself.**\nThis option correctly identifies the error in the third argument. The statement \"for all $n \\ge n_0$ we have $n \\le n_0$\" is a patent falsehood for any $n  n_0$. It fundamentally misunderstands that $n_0$ establishes a semi-infinite interval $[n_0, \\infty)$ over which the inequality must be satisfied.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. The choice $c = n$ in the first step is acceptable because it makes $f(n) \\le c \\cdot 1$ true for each $n$, so the proof correctly satisfies the definition of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.**\nThis option presents an incorrect justification. While it is true that picking $c=n$ makes the inequality $n \\le n$ hold, this choice of $c$ is not permissible under the rules of $\\mathcal{O}$-notation, as explained in the analysis of option A. Therefore, this option incorrectly defends a flawed step.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The proof uses the inequality $f(n) \\le c \\cdot 1$, but the definition of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ actually requires $f(n) \\ge c \\cdot 1$; the direction of inequality is wrong.**\nThis option misstates the definition of $\\mathcal{O}$-notation. The definition of $f(n) \\in \\mathcal{O}(g(n))$ requires an upper bound, $f(n) \\le c \\cdot g(n)$. The inequality for a lower bound, $f(n) \\ge c \\cdot g(n)$, corresponds to $\\Omega$-notation. The purported proof uses the correct inequality for $\\mathcal{O}$-notation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. The only issue is the specific choice $n_0 = 10$; picking a sufficiently large $n_0$ would make the inequality $n \\le n_0$ true for all $n \\ge n_0$ and thus would fix the proof.**\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. First, it claims the error with $n_0$ is the *only* issue, which is false, as documented in options A and B. Second, its proposed \"fix\" is impossible. There is no value of $n_0$ for which the statement \"$n \\le n_0$ for all $n \\ge n_0$\" is true. The reasoning is fundamentally flawed and cannot be fixed by choosing a different $n_0$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3210000"}, {"introduction": "With a solid grasp of the definitions, a crucial next step is to build an intuition for the relative growth rates of functions commonly encountered in algorithm analysis.

The derivative is $g'(n) = 1 - \\frac{5000}{n}$.\nThe derivative $g'(n)$ is zero when $n=5000$.\n- For $0  n  5000$, $g'(n)  0$, so $g(n)$ is decreasing.\n- For $n  5000$, $g'(n)  0$, so $g(n)$ is increasing.\nThus, $g(n)$ has a global minimum at $n=5000$. The value at the minimum is $g(5000) = 5000 - 5000\\,\\ln(5000) = 5000(1-\\ln(5000))$. Since $e \\approx 2.718$, we know $e^2  5000$, so $\\ln(5000)  \\ln(e^2) = 2  1$. Therefore, $g(5000)  0$.\nNow consider the limits of $g(n)$:\n$\\lim_{n \\to 0^{+}} g(n) = \\lim_{n \\to 0^{+}} (n - 5000\\,\\ln n) = 0 - 5000(-\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n(1 - \\frac{5000\\,\\ln n}{n}) = +\\infty$, since $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln n}{n} = 0$.\nSince the function $g(n)$ decreases from $+\\infty$ to a negative minimum and then increases back to $+\\infty$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of exactly two positive roots: one root $n_{small}$ in the interval $(0, 5000)$, and another root $n_{large}$ in the interval $(5000, \\infty)$. The problem asks for the larger of these two, which is well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, objective, and well-posed. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe crossover point $n_{0}$ is the larger positive solution to the equation:\n$$T_{A}(n) = T_{B}(n)$$\n$$500\\,n\\,\\ln n = 0.1\\,n^{2}$$\nSince we are looking for a solution where $n  0$, we can safely divide both sides by $n$:\n$$500\\,\\ln n = 0.1\\,n$$\nMultiplying by $10$ to simplify the constants gives:\n$$5000\\,\\ln n = n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation, which does not have a closed-form solution using elementary functions. We must use a numerical method to find an approximate solution. A suitable method is fixed-point iteration. We can rearrange the equation into the form $n = h(n)$ and use the iterative formula $n_{k+1} = h(n_k)$.\n\nThe equation is already in the form $n = 5000\\,\\ln n$. Let's define the iteration function as $h(n) = 5000\\,\\ln n$. The iterative process is given by:\n$$n_{k+1} = 5000\\,\\ln(n_k)$$\nFor this iteration to converge to a root $n_{0}$, the absolute value of the derivative of the iteration function, $|h'(n)|$, must be less than $1$ in the neighborhood of the root. The derivative is:\n$$h'(n) = \\frac{d}{dn}(5000\\,\\ln n) = \\frac{5000}{n}$$\nAs established in the validation phase, there are two roots. We are seeking the larger root, $n_{0}$, which is greater than $5000$. For any $n  5000$, we have:\n$$|h'(n)| = \\left|\\frac{5000}{n}\\right|  1$$\nThus, the fixed-point iteration will converge to the larger root if we start with an initial guess $n_{start}  5000$. A simple initial guess could be $n_{start} = 10000$.\n\nLet's perform the iteration:\n- $n_1 = 5000\\,\\ln(10000) \\approx 5000 \\times 9.21034 = 46051.70$\n- $n_2 = 5000\\,\\ln(46051.70) \\approx 5000 \\times 10.73755 = 53687.75$\n- $n_3 = 5000\\,\\ln(53687.75) \\approx 5000 \\times 10.89083 = 54454.15$\n- $n_4 = 5000\\,\\ln(54454.15) \\approx 5000 \\times 10.90510 = 54525.50$\n- $n_5 = 5000\\,\\ln(54525.50) \\approx 5000 \\times 10.90639 = 54531.95$\n- $n_6 = 5000\\,\\ln(54531.95) \\approx 5000 \\times 10.90650 = 54532.50$\n- $n_7 = 5000\\,\\ln(54532.50) \\approx 5000 \\times 10.90651 = 54532.55$\n- $n_8 = 5000\\,\\ln(54532.55) \\approx 5000 \\times 10.90651 = 54532.55$\n\nThe sequence converges rapidly to a value of approximately $54532.55$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number is $54532.55$.\nThe first significant digit is $5$.\nThe second significant digit is $4$.\nThe third significant digit is $5$.\nThe fourth significant digit is $3$.\nThe fifth significant digit is $2$. Since $2  5$, we round down, which means we keep the fourth digit as it is.\nThe number rounded to four significant figures is $54530$. To express this unambiguously and according to the specified format rules, we write it in scientific notation.\n$54530 = 5.453 \\times 10^{4}$.\n\nFor all $n \\ge n_0 \\approx 5.453 \\times 10^4$, algorithm A will be faster than algorithm B.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.453 \\times 10^{4}}\n$$", "id": "3210023"}]}
