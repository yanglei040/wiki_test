The worst-case competitive ratio for $\\mathcal{A}$ is the supremum of this ratio over all admissible $n$, and the optimal (minimal) worst-case competitive ratio is the infimum of that supremum over the algorithm’s design choices.\n\nWe formalize the costs. Let $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}$ be the buy cost, $1$ be the daily rent cost, and $T \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ be the threshold parameter of the deterministic threshold algorithm $\\mathcal{A}_{T}$ defined as: rent for the first $T$ days; if the season continues to day $T+1$, buy at the start of day $T+1$.\n\nFor a realized season length $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}$, the offline optimal cost, denoted $\\operatorname{OPT}(n)$, is obtained by choosing the cheaper of renting every day or buying at the outset:\n$$\n\\operatorname{OPT}(n) = \\min\\{n,\\, b\\}.\n$$\nThis follows from the fact that buying at any later time weakly dominates buying earlier plus renting some prefix, and renting every day dominates any plan that includes buying strictly after the first day.\n\nThe cost of $\\mathcal{A}_{T}$ for a realized $n$ is\n$$\n\\operatorname{ALG}_{T}(n) = \n\\begin{cases}\nn,  \\text{if } n \\le T \\quad (\\text{the algorithm only rents}),\\\\\nT + b,  \\text{if } n \\ge T+1 \\quad (\\text{the algorithm rents } T \\text{ days then buys}).\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe now encode the lazy adversary’s $L$-day lookahead constraint.

Moreover, on the domain where $T+L  b$ (which implies $L  b$), the function $\\frac{T+b}{T+L}$ is strictly decreasing in $T$ because its derivative with respect to $T$ is $\\frac{(T+L) - (T+b)}{(T+L)^{2}} = \\frac{L-b}{(T+L)^{2}}  0$. Therefore, within this subcase, $R(T)$ is minimized by taking $T$ as large as possible subject to $T+L  b$, i.e., $T = b - L - 1$. As $T$ approaches the boundary $T+L \\to b$ from below, $\\frac{T+b}{T+L} \\to \\frac{b + (b-L)}{b} = 2 - \\frac{L}{b}$.\n- If $T+L \\ge b$: $R(T) = \\max\\left\\{1, \\frac{T+b}{b}\\right\\} = 1 + \\frac{T}{b}$, which is strictly increasing in $T$. Thus, in this subcase the minimum occurs at the smallest $T$ with $T+L \\ge b$, namely $T = b - L$, yielding $R(T) = 1 + \\frac{b - L}{b} = 2 - \\frac{L}{b}$.\n\nComparing the two subcases in $T  b$, the optimal choice is to take $T$ at the boundary $T = b - L$ (provided $b - L \\ge 0$), which achieves\n$$\nR(T) = 2 - \\frac{L}{b}.\n$$\n\nCase $2$: $T \\ge b$.

Hence $R(T) = 1 + \\frac{T}{b}$, which is minimized at the smallest admissible $T$, namely $T = b$, giving $R(T) = 2$. This is never better than the value obtained in Case $1$ when $L \\ge 1$, because $2 - \\frac{L}{b} \\le 2$ with strict inequality for $L \\ge 1$.\n\nFinally, we must also consider the regime $L \\ge b$. In that case, the boundary choice $T = b - L$ from Case $1$ becomes $T \\le 0$, and the smallest feasible threshold is $T = 0$. With $T = 0$, the algorithm buys immediately; by the lazy adversary constraint, if the algorithm buys at day $1$, then $n \\ge 0 + L \\ge b$, so $\\operatorname{OPT}(n) = b$ and $\\operatorname{ALG}_{0}(n) = b$, implying a ratio of $1$. This coincides with the formula $2 - \\frac{L}{b}$ evaluated at $L = b$, which yields $1$, and for $L  b$ the expression $2 - \\frac{L}{b}$ drops below $1$ but the competitive ratio cannot be below $1$, so the optimal worst-case ratio saturates at $1$.\n\nThus, the minimal possible worst-case competitive ratio, as a function of $b$ and $L$, is\n$$\nR^{\\star}(b,L) = \\max\\left\\{ 1,\\ 2 - \\frac{L}{b} \\right\\}.\n$$\nEquivalently, in piecewise form, $R^{\\star}(b,L) = 2 - \\frac{L}{b}$ for $0 \\le L \\le b$ and $R^{\\star}(b,L) = 1$ for $L \\ge b$.

All parameters and the objective are clearly stated.\n\nLet $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ be the current day of the ski season. We are given that the season has not yet ended, i.e., the total number of ski days $K$ is at least $t$ ($K \\ge t$). We must decide whether to rent skis for a cost of $r$ for the day, or buy them for a one-time cost of $b$. We assume we have not yet bought the skis.\n\nLet $V(t)$ be the minimal expected future cost given that we are at the start of day $t$ and have not bought skis. This is our value function for the dynamic programming formulation. The state is defined by the day $t$. The horizon is finite, ending at $N$. We solve this using backward induction, from day $N$ to day $1$.\n\nAt the start of day $t$, we have two actions:\n1.  **Buy**: The cost is $b$. This cost is incurred immediately, and there are no further costs for the rest of the season, regardless of how many more days it lasts. The total future cost is $b$.\n2.  **Rent**: The cost for today is $r$. The season may end today, or it may continue to day $t+1$. We need to account for the expected cost of future decisions. The total expected future cost, if we rent today, is the sum of today's rental cost $r$ and the expected cost from day $t+1$ onwards, conditioned on the season continuing.\n\nLet $S(t) = P(K \\ge t) = \\sum_{k=t}^{N} P(k)$ be the survival function, the probability that the season lasts at least $t$ days. Note that $S(1) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} P(k) = 1$.\nThe decision at day $t$ is conditioned on $K \\ge t$.

We need a boundary condition. Let's define $V(N+1)=0$, as there are no more possible ski days and thus zero future cost.\nFor $t=N$, given $K \\ge N$, we must have $K=N$. So the season lasts for exactly one more day. The probability of continuing to day $N+1$ is $P(K \\ge N+1 | K \\ge N) = S(N+1)/S(N) = 0$.\nThe recursion at $t=N$ becomes:\n$$ V(N) = \\min \\left( b, r + \\frac{S(N+1)}{S(N)} V(N+1) \\right) = \\min(b, r + 0) = \\min(b, r) $$\nThis is logical: on the last possible day, one should simply compare the single-day rental cost with the purchase price.\n\nThe structure of the optimal policy can be deduced from this recurrence. An optimal policy is a stopping rule that specifies when to stop renting and buy the skis. Once skis are bought, the process terminates. Let's assume the optimal policy has a threshold structure: rent for days $t=1, \\dots, \\tau-1$, and if the season is still going on day $\\tau$, buy the skis. Here $\\tau \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N+1\\}$ is the threshold day to buy. $\\tau=1$ means buy on day $1$. $\\tau=N+1$ means never buy (always rent).\n\nLet's verify this structure's consistency with the DP recurrence. If the policy is to buy on day $\\tau$, then for any $t \\ge \\tau$, if we reach day $t$, we buy. This implies $V(t) = b$ for all $t \\ge \\tau$.\nFor $t  \\tau$, the policy is to rent. So $V(t) = r + \\frac{S(t+1)}{S(t)}V(t+1)$.\nAt day $\\tau$, the decision must be to buy. This implies:\n$$ b \\le r + \\frac{S(\\tau+1)}{S(\\tau)} V(\\tau+1) $$\nSince $\\tau+1$ is also in the \"buy\" region, $V(\\tau+1) = b$. The condition becomes:\n$$ b \\le r + \\frac{S(\\tau+1)}{S(\\tau)} b \\implies b \\left(1 - \\frac{S(\\tau+1)}{S(\\tau)}\\right) \\le r \\implies b \\frac{S(\\tau)-S(\\tau+1)}{S(\\tau)} \\le r $$\nSince $S(\\tau) - S(\\tau+1) = \\sum_{k=\\tau}^N P(k) - \\sum_{k=\\tau+1}^N P(k) = P(\\tau)$, this simplifies to:\n$$ b \\frac{P(\\tau)}{S(\\tau)} \\le r \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b P(\\tau) \\le r S(\\tau) $$\nAt day $\\tau-1$, the decision must be to rent. This implies:\n$$ b  r + \\frac{S(\\tau)}{S(\\tau-1)} V(\\tau) $$\nSince $\\tau$ is the \"buy\" day, $V(\\tau) = b$. The condition becomes:\n$$ b  r + \\frac{S(\\tau)}{S(\\tau-1)} b \\implies b \\left(1 - \\frac{S(\\tau)}{S(\\tau-1)}\\right)  r \\implies b \\frac{S(\\tau-1)-S(\\tau)}{S(\\tau-1)}  r $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ b \\frac{P(\\tau-1)}{S(\\tau-1)}  r \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b P(\\tau-1)  r S(\\tau-1) $$\nCombining these results, the optimal threshold $\\tau_{opt}$ is the first day $t$ for which the \"buy\" condition $b P(t) \\le r S(t)$ is met. If this condition is never met for $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, then we always rent, which corresponds to $\\tau_{opt} = N+1$.\nThus, the optimal buying day is $\\tau_{opt} = \\min(\\{t \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid b P(t) \\le r S(t)\\} \\cup \\{N+1\\})$. The structure of the optimal policy is indeed a simple threshold policy.\n\nNow we can derive a closed-form expression for the minimal expected total cost, which is $V(1)$.\nThe cost is determined by the actual number of ski days, $k$, under the optimal policy with threshold $\\tau_{opt}$.\n- If $K=k  \\tau_{opt}$: we rent for $k$ days. The cost is $k \\cdot r$.\n- If $K=k \\ge \\tau_{opt}$: we rent for $\\tau_{opt}-1$ days and then buy on day $\\tau_{opt}$. The cost is $(\\tau_{opt}-1)r + b$.\n\nThe expected total cost is the sum of these costs weighted by the probability $P(k)$:\n$$ V(1) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\tau_{opt}-1} (k \\cdot r) P(k) + \\sum_{k=\\tau_{opt}}^{N} ((\\tau_{opt}-1)r + b) P(k) $$\n$$ V(1) = r \\sum_{k=1}^{\\tau_{opt}-1} k P(k) + ((\\tau_{opt}-1)r + b) \\sum_{k=\\tau_{opt}}^{N} P(k) $$\n$$ V(1) = r \\sum_{k=1}^{\\tau_{opt}-1} k P(k) + ((\\tau_{opt}-1)r + b) S(\\tau_{opt}) $$\nThis expression can be simplified. Let's use the recurrence relation we found for the total cost of a threshold policy. For $t  \\tau_{opt}$, we have $V(t) = r + \\frac{S(t+1)}{S(t)}V(t+1)$. This can be rewritten as $S(t)V(t) = rS(t) + S(t+1)V(t+1)$.\nThis gives a telescoping-like relation. For $t = \\tau_{opt}-1$:\n$S(\\tau_{opt}-1)V(\\tau_{opt}-1) = rS(\\tau_{opt}-1) + S(\\tau_{opt})V(\\tau_{opt}) = rS(\\tau_{opt}-1) + b S(\\tau_{opt})$ since $V(\\tau_{opt})=b$.\nFor $t = \\tau_{opt}-2$:\n$S(\\tau_{opt}-2)V(\\tau_{opt}-2) = rS(\\tau_{opt}-2) + S(\\tau_{opt}-1)V(\\tau_{opt}-1) = rS(\\tau_{opt}-2) + rS(\\tau_{opt}-1) + bS(\\tau_{opt})$.\nBy induction, for any $t  \\tau_{opt}$:\n$$ S(t)V(t) = r \\sum_{j=t}^{\\tau_{opt}-1} S(j) + b S(\\tau_{opt}) $$\nThe minimal total cost from the start of the season is $V(1)$. Since $S(1)=1$:\n$$ V(1) = r \\sum_{j=1}^{\\tau_{opt}-1} S(j) + b S(\\tau_{opt}) $$\nWhile this expression depends on $\\tau_{opt}$, which itself must be calculated, an alternative way to express the minimal cost is to state it as the minimum over all possible threshold policies.

On each day, renting costs a positive integer amount $r$ measured in arbitrary monetary units and buying costs a positive integer amount $B$ in the same units.

The classic lazy-buy strategy is to rent until the cumulative rent is at least equal to the buy cost and then buy; in exact arithmetic, this results in the buy day $d^\\star = \\lceil B / r \\rceil$.

An agent faces a daily rental cost of $r$ and a one-time purchase cost of $B$. The number of days the agent will require the service is unknown in advance. The lazy-buy strategy dictates that the agent should rent on each day $d$ as long as the cumulative rental cost, $d \\cdot r$, is less than the buy cost $B$.

Since $T$ is an integer, this inequality is equivalent to $d \\cdot r / s \\ge T$. Rearranging for $d$, we get $d \\ge (T \\cdot s) / r$. As $d$ must be an integer, the smallest value of $d$ that satisfies this is:\n$$d_s = \\left\\lceil \\frac{T \\cdot s}{r} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nThe selection of the scaling factor $s$ is critical and must balance two competing objectives: precision and overflow safety.\n- A smaller $s$ (e.g., $s=1$) yields higher precision, as the effective buy threshold, $\\lfloor B/s \\rfloor \\cdot s$, is closer to the true value $B$. However, this results in a larger scaled threshold $T$, increasing the risk of overflow.\n- A larger $s$ provides a greater margin of safety against overflow by reducing the magnitude of $T$. However, it reduces precision by increasing the quantization error $B - (\\lfloor B/s \\rfloor \\cdot s)$. This can lead to a significant deviation from the exact strategy.\n\nThe problem specifies a deterministic procedure for selecting $s=2^k$:\n1.  The scaled threshold $T$ must be non-degenerate, i.e., $T \\ge 1$. This implies $\\lfloor B / s \\rfloor \\ge 1$, which requires $s \\le B$.\n2.  The scaled threshold $T$ and accumulator must not overflow the $N$-bit counter, meaning $T \\le C_{\\max}$.\n3.  To maintain reasonable precision, the selection logic prioritizes keeping $T$ in the upper portion of the counter's range. Specifically, we attempt to find the largest scaling factor $s=2^k$ such that the resulting threshold $T$ satisfies $T \\ge \\left\\lceil (2^N - 1) / 8 \\right\\rceil$.\n4.  If it is not possible to satisfy the condition in step 3 (which occurs if $B$ itself is too small), we fall back to choosing the largest possible scaling factor $s=2^k$ that still ensures a non-degenerate threshold, $T \\ge 1$. This amounts to selecting the largest power of two that is less than or equal to $B$.\n\nThe deviation between the scaled and exact strategies is $\\Delta = d^\\star - d_s$. We can demonstrate that $\\Delta \\ge 0$. The effective buy threshold in the scaled version is $B_{eff} = \\lfloor B/s \\rfloor \\cdot s$. Since $\\lfloor B/s \\rfloor \\le B/s$, we have $B_{eff} \\le B$. The scaled algorithm triggers a buy based on this lower or equal effective threshold, so it will never buy later than the exact algorithm. Thus, $d_s \\le d^\\star$, and the deviation $\\Delta$ is always non-negative. The magnitude of $\\Delta$ is related to the quantization error $B - B_{eff} = B \\pmod s$. A larger $s$ can lead to a larger error, potentially causing a larger $\\Delta$ and an earlier, less optimal purchase.\n\nThe implementation of the scaled accumulator, $A_d = \\lfloor d \\cdot r / s \\rfloor$, can be achieved without floating-point arithmetic using a remainder-tracking method. A remainder register, `rem`, is initialized to $0$. On each day, the daily cost $r$ is added to this register. The amount to increment the main accumulator is the integer quotient of the new remainder and the scaling factor, `inc = rem // s`. The main accumulator is incremented by `inc`, and the remainder is updated by subtracting the portion that was \"banked\": `rem = rem - inc * s`. This ensures that over $d$ days, the total value added to the accumulator is precisely $\\lfloor d \\cdot r / s \\rfloor$.\n\nFor this remainder-based accumulation to be overflow-safe within an $N$-bit register, the intermediate sum `rem + r` must not exceed $C_{\\max}$. Since the remainder `rem` is always kept in the range $[0, s-1]$, the maximum value of the intermediate sum is $(s-1) + r$. Therefore, a sufficient condition for safety of the remainder register is $s + r - 1 \\le C_{\\max}$. The problem's givens and constraints adhere to this, ensuring the entire algorithm is overflow-safe. The main accumulator is also safe, as it only ever reaches a value close to $T$, and the selection logic for $s$ ensures $T$ is well within the counter's capacity.\n\nWe will now apply this complete methodology to the provided test cases. For each case $(N, r, B)$, we calculate $C_{\\max}$, determine the appropriate scaling factor $s$ based on the specified logic, and then compute the scaled buy day $d_s$, the exact buy day $d^\\star$, and the resulting deviation $\\Delta = d^\\star - d_s$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the scaled ski rental problem for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite covering typical behavior, boundaries, and edge conditions.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (N: counter width in bits, r: daily rent cost, B: buy cost).\n    test_cases = [\n        (8, 9, 200),\n        (16, 1, 50000),\n        (8, 200, 201),\n        (8, 9, 19),\n        (12, 300, 4000),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for N, r, B in test_cases:\n        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n        # PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND PARAMETER CALCULATION\n        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        # C_max: Maximum value for an N-bit unsigned counter.\n        C_max = (1  N) - 1\n\n        # d_star: The exact, unscaled buy day.\n        # This is ceil(B/r), calculated using integer arithmetic to avoid float precision issues.\n        # The formula (a + b - 1) // b computes ceil(a/b) for positive integers a, b.\n        d_star = (B + r - 1) // r\n\n        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n        # SCALING FACTOR (s) SELECTION LOGIC\n        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n        # The goal is to choose a scaling factor s = 2^k that balances precision\n        # (small s) with overflow safety (large s).\n        #\n        # Trade-off discussion:\n        # - Precision: The scaled threshold T = floor(B/s) introduces quantization.\n        #   The effective buy cost is floor(B/s) * s, which is = B.
