The tasks are logically sequenced and require application of core theoretical principles (specifically, the max-flow min-cut theorem). The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not ambiguous, and contains no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Task 1: Minimum Cut in the Original Network**\n\nAn $s-t$ cut is a partition of the vertex set $V$ into two disjoint sets, $S$ and $T$, such that $s \\in S$ and $t \\in T$. The capacity of the cut $(S,T)$, denoted $\\text{cap}(S,T)$, is the sum of capacities of all arcs $(x,y)$ where $x \\in S$ and $y \\in T$. We seek a cut with the minimum possible capacity.\n\nLet's examine some possible $s-t$ cuts in the original network:\n1.  $S_1 = \\{s\\}$, $T_1 = \\{u,v,w,t\\}$. The arcs from $S_1$ to $T_1$ are $(s,u)$ and $(s,v)$.\n    $\\text{cap}(S_1, T_1) = c(s,u) + c(s,v) = 6 + 5 = 11$.\n2.  $S_2 = \\{s,u\\}$, $T_2 = \\{v,w,t\\}$. The arcs from $S_2$ to $T_2$ are $(s,v)$ and $(u,w)$.\n    $\\text{cap}(S_2, T_2) = c(s,v) + c(u,w) = 5 + 4 = 9$.\n3.  $S_3 = \\{s,v\\}$, $T_3 = \\{u,w,t\\}$. The arcs from $S_3$ to $T_3$ are $(s,u)$ and $(v,w)$.\n    $\\text{cap}(S_3, T_3) = c(s,u) + c(v,w) = 6 + 3 = 9$.\n4.  $S_4 = \\{s,u,v\\}$, $T_4 = \\{w,t\\}$. The arcs from $S_4$ to $T_4$ are $(u,w)$ and $(v,w)$.\n    $\\text{cap}(S_4, T_4) = c(u,w) + c(v,w) = 4 + 3 = 7$.\n5.  $S_5 = \\{s,u,v,w\\}$, $T_5 = \\{t\\}$. The only arc from $S_5$ to $T_5$ is $(w,t)$.\n    $\\text{cap}(S_5, T_5) = c(w,t) = 5$.\n\nThe cut $(S_5,T_5)$ has capacity $5$. To confirm this is a minimum cut, we can use the max-flow min-cut theorem, which states that the value of the maximum flow in a network is equal to the capacity of a minimum cut. If we can find a feasible $s-t$ flow with a value of $5$, then no cut can have a capacity less than $5$, and thus $(S_5,T_5)$ must be a minimum cut.\n\nConsider the following flow $f$:\n- Path $s \\to u \\to w \\to t$: Send $4$ units of flow. This is limited by $c(u,w)=4$.\n- Path $s \\to v \\to w \\to t$: Send $1$ unit of flow. This is limited by the remaining capacity on $(w,t)$, which is $c(w,t)-4=1$.\nThis assignment defines the flow function $f$:\n$f(s,u)=4$, $f(u,w)=4$.\n$f(s,v)=1$, $f(v,w)=1$.\n$f(w,t) = 4+1=5$.\nAll other arc flows are $0$.\n\nLet's check feasibility:\n- Capacity constraints:\n  $f(s,u)=4 \\le c(s,u)=6$ (OK)\n  $f(s,v)=1 \\le c(s,v)=5$ (OK)\n  $f(u,w)=4 \\le c(u,w)=4$ (OK)\n  $f(v,w)=1 \\le c(v,w)=3$ (OK)\n  $f(w,t)=5 \\le c(w,t)=5$ (OK)\n- Flow conservation:\n  - At $u$: Flow in is $f(s,u)=4$. Flow out is $f(u,w)=4$. Conserved.\n  - At $v$: Flow in is $f(s,v)=1$. Flow out is $f(v,w)=1$. Conserved.\n  - At $w$: Flow in is $f(u,w)+f(v,w)=4+1=5$. Flow out is $f(w,t)=5$. Conserved.\n\nThe total flow value, which is the net flow out of the source $s$, is $|f| = f(s,u) + f(s,v) = 4+1=5$.\nSince we have found a flow of value $5$ and a cut of capacity $5$, by the max-flow min-cut theorem, this is a maximum flow and the cut $(S_5, T_5)$ is a minimum cut. The capacity of a minimum $s-t$ cut is $5$.\n\n**Task 2: Effect of Arc $(u,v)$ on Minimum Cut and Maximum Flow**\n\nWe now add a new arc $(u,v)$ with capacity $c(u,v)=10$. The network is now augmented.\nThe capacity of a cut $(S,T)$ is given by $\\sum_{(x,y) \\in S \\times T} c(x,y)$.\nLet's consider the minimum cut found in the original network, $(S_5, T_5)$, where $S_5=\\{s,u,v,w\\}$ and $T_5=\\{t\\}$.\nThe new arc is $(u,v)$. Its source vertex is $u$ and its destination vertex is $v$.\nFor this arc to contribute to the capacity of the cut $(S_5, T_5)$, we would need $u \\in S_5$ and $v \\in T_5$. However, both $u$ and $v$ are in $S_5$. Thus, the arc $(u,v)$ does not cross the cut from $S_5$ to $T_5$, and its capacity does not contribute to $\\text{cap}(S_5, T_5)$. The capacity of this specific cut remains unchanged at $5$.\n\nAdding an arc to a network can never decrease the capacity of any cut, because the capacity function is non-negative. For any cut $(S,T)$, its new capacity $\\text{cap}'(S,T)$ is either equal to its old capacity $\\text{cap}(S,T)$ (if the new arc does not cross from $S$ to $T$) or greater than its old capacity (if it does).\nSince we have identified a cut, $(S_5,T_5)$, whose capacity remains $5$ in the augmented network, the minimum cut capacity in the new network, $\\text{min_cap}'$, must be less than or equal to $5$.\nFurthermore, the value of any flow is a lower bound for the min-cut capacity. The original maximum flow of value $5$ is still a valid flow in the augmented network (by simply setting $f(u,v)=0$). Thus, the new maximum flow value $|f'_{\\text{max}}|$ must be at least $5$.\nBy the max-flow min-cut theorem, $|f'_{\\text{max}}| = \\text{min_cap}'$.\nWe have $5 \\le |f'_{\\text{max}}| = \\text{min_cap}' \\le 5$.\nThis forces $\\text{min_cap}'=5$. Therefore, the minimum cut capacity is unchanged. The cut $(S_5, T_5)$ remains a minimum cut.\nConsequently, the maximum $s-t$ flow value is also unchanged and remains $5$.\n\n**Task 3: Persistent Bottleneck Identification**\n\nTo identify the persistent bottleneck, we analyze the residual network $G_f$ corresponding to a maximum flow $f$ in the augmented network. We can use the same flow of value $5$ as determined before, with $f(u,v)=0$:\n$f(s,u)=4$, $f(s,v)=1$, $f(u,w)=4$, $f(v,w)=1$, $f(w,t)=5$.\nIn the augmented network, we also have $c(u,v)=10$ and $f(u,v)=0$.\n\nThe residual capacity $c_f(x,y)$ for an arc $(x,y)$ is given by $c(x,y)-f(x,y)$ for the forward arc and $f(x,y)$ for the backward arc $(y,x)$.\nLet's find the set of vertices $S_f$ reachable from $s$ in $G_f$ using only arcs with positive residual capacity.\n1. Start with $S_f = \\{s\\}$.\n2. From $s$, we can reach $u$ because $c_f(s,u) = c(s,u)-f(s,u) = 6-4=2  0$.\n3. From $s$, we can reach $v$ because $c_f(s,v) = c(s,v)-f(s,v) = 5-1=4  0$.\n   So, now we have processed $s$ and found that $u,v$ are reachable. $S_f = \\{s, u, v\\}$.\n4. From $u$, we can reach:\n   - $s$ (backward arc): $c_f(u,s) = f(s,u)=40$. $s$ is already in $S_f$.\n   - $w$ (forward arc): $c_f(u,w) = c(u,w)-f(u,w) = 4-4=0$. Not a path.\n   - $v$ (forward arc, new): $c_f(u,v) = c(u,v)-f(u,v) = 10-0=100$. $v$ is already in $S_f$.\n5. From $v$, we can reach:\n   - $s$ (backward arc): $c_f(v,s) = f(s,v)=10$. $s$ is already in $S_f$.\n   - $w$ (forward arc): $c_f(v,w) = c(v,w)-f(v,w) = 3-1=20$. $w$ is not in $S_f$, so we add it. Now $S_f=\\{s,u,v,w\\}$.\n6. From the newly added vertex $w$, we can reach:\n   - $u$ (backward arc): $c_f(w,u) = f(u,w)=40$. $u$ is in $S_f$.\n   - $v$ (backward arc): $c_f(w,v) = f(v,w)=10$. $v$ is in $S_f$.\n   - $t$ (forward arc): $c_f(w,t) = c(w,t)-f(w,t) = 5-5=0$. Not a path.\nNo more vertices can be reached from $s$. The set of reachable vertices is $S_f=\\{s,u,v,w\\}$. The sink $t$ is not in $S_f$, confirming that there are no augmenting paths from $s$ to $t$ and the flow $f$ is maximal.\n\nThe partition $(S_f, V\\setminus S_f) = (\\{s,u,v,w\\}, \\{t\\})$ corresponds to the minimum cut. The bottleneck is the set of forward arcs from $S_f$ to $V\\setminus S_f$ that are saturated.\nThe only original arc from $S_f$ to $V\\setminus S_f$ is $(w,t)$.\nThe flow on this arc is $f(w,t)=5$, and its capacity is $c(w,t)=5$. Since $f(w,t)=c(w,t)$, the arc is saturated.\nThis saturation is what prevents any more flow from reaching the sink $t$ from the component $S_f$. Therefore, the forward arc $(w,t)$ acts as the persistent bottleneck.\n\n**Task 4: Maximum Flow in the Augmented Network**\n\nAs demonstrated in the reasoning for Task 2, the introduction of the arc $(u,v)$ with capacity $10$ does not change the capacity of the minimum $s-t$ cut, which remains $5$. According to the max-flow min-cut theorem, the value of the maximum flow is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut.\nTherefore, the maximum $s-t$ flow value in the augmented network is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3255344"}, {"introduction": "The power of network flow extends far beyond simple transport scenarios; it is a versatile modeling tool for a wide range of problems.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths from a source vertex $s$ to a sink vertex $t$ in a given directed graph $G$. The problem specifies the method to be used: a standard node-splitting construction to create a flow network $G'$, followed by a maximum flow calculation. The maximum flow value in $G'$ will be equal to the number of such paths in $G$. This is a direct application of the max-flow min-cut theorem in conjunction with Menger's theorem for vertex connectivity.\n\nThe maximum flow value in a network is equal to the minimum capacity of an $s-t$ cut. An $s-t$ cut is a partition of the vertices of $G'$ into two sets, $S$ and $T$, such that $s \\in S$ and $t \\in T$. The capacity of the cut $(S, T)$ is the sum of the capacities of all edges $(u, v)$ where $u \\in S$ and $v \\in T$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the graph $G$. The set of internal vertices can be partitioned into three successive layers:\n- Layer $1$: $L_1 = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$\n- Layer $2$: $L_2 = \\{p, q, r\\}$\n- Layer $3$: $L_3 = \\{x, y, z\\}$\n\nEvery path from $s$ to $t$ must pass through a vertex from $L_1$, then a vertex from $L_2$, and finally a vertex from $L_3$. A set of internal vertices whose removal disconnects all paths from $s$ to $t$ is called an $s-t$ vertex cut. The minimum size of such a cut gives the maximum number of internally vertex-disjoint paths.\n\nThe sets $L_2$ and $L_3$ are themselves $s-t$ vertex cuts.\nThe size of $L_1$ is $|L_1| = 4$.\nThe size of $L_2$ is $|L_2| = 3$.\nThe size of $L_3$ is $|L_3| = 3$.\n\nThe minimum size of these layer-based cuts is $3$. This suggests that the minimum vertex cut size is at most $3$. Let's formalize this by constructing a corresponding $s-t$ cut in the flow network $G'$.\n\nConsider the vertex cut $L_2 = \\{p, q, r\\}$ in $G$. We can define an $s-t$ cut $(S, T)$ in $G'$ as follows:\n- Let $S = \\{s\\} \\cup \\{v^{\\mathrm{in}}, v^{\\mathrm{out}} \\mid v \\in L_1\\} \\cup \\{v^{\\mathrm{in}} \\mid v \\in L_2\\}$.\n- Let $T$ be the set of all other vertices in $G'$, so $t \\in T$.\n\nThe edges from $S$ to $T$ are:\n$1$. Edges of the form $(v^{\\mathrm{in}}, v^{\\mathrm{out}})$:\nFor $v \\in L_2 = \\{p, q, r\\}$, we have $v^{\\mathrm{in}} \\in S$ and $v^{\\mathrm{out}} \\in T$. These three edges, $(p^{\\mathrm{in}}, p^{\\mathrm{out}})$, $(q^{\\mathrm{in}}, q^{\\mathrm{out}})$, and $(r^{\\mathrm{in}}, r^{\\mathrm{out}})$, cross the cut. Each has a capacity of $1$. The total capacity from these edges is $1+1+1=3$.\n\n$2$. Edges corresponding to original edges in $E$ (with capacity $\\infty$):\nAny such edge $(u,v)$ from $S$ to $T$ would give the cut infinite capacity. We must verify that no such edge exists.\n- $(s, v^{\\mathrm{in}})$ for $v \\in L_1$: $s \\in S, v^{\\mathrm{in}} \\in S$. Does not cross.\n- $(u^{\\mathrm{out}}, v^{\\mathrm{in}})$ for $u \\in L_1, v \\in L_2$: $u^{\\mathrm{out}} \\in S, v^{\\mathrm{in}} \\in S$. Does not cross.\n- All other edges with infinite capacity (e.g., $(u^{\\mathrm{out}}, v^{\\mathrm{in}})$ for $u \\in L_2, v \\in L_3$) either have both endpoints in $T$ or do not exist. For example, for an edge like $(p^{\\mathrm{out}}, x^{\\mathrm{in}})$, $p^{\\mathrm{out}} \\in T$ and $x^{\\mathrm{in}} \\in T$. It does not cross from $S$ to $T$.\n\nThe total capacity of this cut $(S,T)$ is exactly $3$. By the max-flow min-cut theorem, the maximum flow value is less than or equal to the capacity of any cut, so $f_{\\max} \\le 3$.\n\nNow, we need to establish a lower bound for the maximum flow. We can do this by finding a set of internally vertex-disjoint paths in $G$. If we find $k$ such paths, then the maximum flow must be at least $k$. Let's try to find $3$ such paths.\nConsider the following three paths:\n- Path $1$: $s \\to a \\to p \\to x \\to t$. The set of internal vertices is $P_1 = \\{a, p, x\\}$.\n- Path $2$: $s \\to b \\to q \\to y \\to t$. The set of internal vertices is $P_2 = \\{b, q, y\\}$.\n- Path $3$: $s \\to c \\to r \\to z \\to t$. The set of internal vertices is $P_3 = \\{c, r, z\\}$.\n\nWe must verify that these paths are valid (i.e., the edges exist) and that they are internally vertex-disjoint.\n- The edges $(s,a)$, $(s,b)$, $(s,c)$ exist.\n- The edges $(a,p)$, $(b,q)$, $(c,r)$ exist, as there is a complete bipartite graph between $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ and $\\{p,q,r\\}$.\n- The edges $(p,x)$, $(q,y)$, $(r,z)$ exist based on the problem description.\n- The edges $(x,t)$, $(y,t)$, $(z,t)$ exist.\nAll paths are valid.\n\nThe sets of internal vertices are $P_1 = \\{a, p, x\\}$, $P_2 = \\{b, q, y\\}$, and $P_3 = \\{c, r, z\\}$. These sets are disjoint: $P_1 \\cap P_2 = \\emptyset$, $P_1 \\cap P_3 = \\emptyset$, and $P_2 \\cap P_3 = \\emptyset$. Thus, the three paths are pairwise internally vertex-disjoint.\n\nThe existence of $3$ internally vertex-disjoint paths implies that the maximum number of such paths is at least $3$. In the flow network $G'$, this corresponds to a flow of value $3$. Therefore, $f_{\\max} \\ge 3$.\n\nCombining the two results:\n- From the min-cut analysis, we have $f_{\\max} \\le 3$.\n- From the path construction, we have $f_{\\max} \\ge 3$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flow value must be exactly $3$.

Derive, from first principles, the exact largest real number $T$ such that for every non-integer $c$ with $0  c \\leq T$, the maximum flow value $f^{\\star}(c)$ is non-integer. Then report $T$.\n\nGive your answer as an exact number (no rounding).", "solution": "The principles of network flow theory, specifically the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, will be used to solve this problem. Let the given network be denoted by $G_c$, with the set of vertices $V = \\{s, a, b, t\\}$, where $s$ is the source and $t$ is the sink. The edge capacities, which are functions of a parameter $c \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}$, are given as:\n$C(s, b) = 1$\n$C(a, t) = 5$\n$C(b, t) = 10$\n$C(s, a) = c$\nAll other edge capacities are assumed to be $0$. We are interested in the maximum flow value, $f^{\\star}(c)$, from $s$ to $t$.\n\nThe Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem states that the value of the maximum flow in a network is equal to the minimum capacity of any $s-t$ cut. An $s-t$ cut is a partition of the vertex set $V$ into two disjoint sets, $S$ and $T$, such that $s \\in S$ and $t \\in T$. The capacity of a cut $(S, T)$ is the sum of capacities of all edges $(u, v)$ where $u \\in S$ and $v \\in T$.\n\nTo find $f^{\\star}(c)$, we must enumerate all possible $s-t$ cuts in the network $G_c$ and calculate their capacities. The vertices $s$ and $t$ must be in sets $S$ and $T$, respectively. The intermediate vertices, $a$ and $b$, can each be in either $S$ or $T$. This gives $2^2 = 4$ possible minimal $s-t$ cuts to consider.\n\n1.  **Cut 1**: $S_1 = \\{s\\}$, $T_1 = \\{a, b, t\\}$.\n    The edges from $S_1$ to $T_1$ are $(s, a)$ and $(s, b)$.\n    The capacity of this cut is $C(S_1, T_1) = C(s, a) + C(s, b) = c + 1$.\n\n2.  **Cut 2**: $S_2 = \\{s, a\\}$, $T_2 = \\{b, t\\}$.\n    The edges from $S_2$ to $T_2$ are $(s, b)$ and $(a, t)$. There are no edges from $T_2$ to $S_2$ to consider for the simple cut capacity calculation. The edge $(s,a)$ is entirely within $S_2$.\n    The capacity of this cut is $C(S_2, T_2) = C(s, b) + C(a, t) = 1 + 5 = 6$.\n\n3.  **Cut 3**: $S_3 = \\{s, b\\}$, $T_3 = \\{a, t\\}$.\n    The edges from $S_3$ to $T_3$ are $(s, a)$ and $(b, t)$. The edge $(s,b)$ is within $S_3$.\n    The capacity of this cut is $C(S_3, T_3) = C(s, a) + C(b, t) = c + 10$.\n\n4.  **Cut 4**: $S_4 = \\{s, a, b\\}$, $T_4 = \\{t\\}$.\n    The edges from $S_4$ to $T_4$ are $(a, t)$ and $(b, t)$.\n    The capacity of this cut is $C(S_4, T_4) = C(a, t) + C(b, t) = 5 + 10 = 15$.\n\nAccording to the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, the maximum flow value $f^{\\star}(c)$ is the minimum of these cut capacities:\n$$f^{\\star}(c) = \\min(c + 1, 6, c + 10, 15)$$\nSince $c  0$, it is always true that $c + 10  c + 1$. Also, $15  6$. Therefore, the expression for $f^{\\star}(c)$ simplifies to:\n$$f^{\\star}(c) = \\min(c + 1, 6)$$\nThis defines $f^{\\star}(c)$ as a piecewise function of $c$. The behavior of the function changes when $c + 1 = 6$, which occurs at $c = 5$.\n\n-   **Case I: $0  c \\leq 5$**\n    In this interval, $c + 1 \\leq 6$, so the minimum is $c + 1$.\n    $$f^{\\star}(c) = c + 1$$\n    The problem asks for the condition where $f^{\\star}(c)$ is non-integer for every non-integer $c$. If $c$ is a non-integer, then $c+1$ is also a non-integer. (Proof by contradiction: If $c+1=k$ for some integer $k$, then $c=k-1$, which would be an integer, contrary to the assumption.) Thus, for all non-integer $c$ in the interval $(0, 5]$, the maximum flow value $f^{\\star}(c)$ is non-integer.\n\n-   **Case II: $c  5$**\n    In this interval, $c + 1  6$, so the minimum is $6$.\n    $$f^{\\star}(c) = 6$$\n    In this regime, the maximum flow value is always the integer $6$, regardless of whether $c$ is an integer or not. For any non-integer $c  5$ (e.g., $c=5.5$), the max flow $f^{\\star}(5.5) = 6$ is an integer.\n\nThe problem requires finding the largest real number $T$ such that for every non-integer $c$ with $0  c \\leq T$, the value $f^{\\star}(c)$ is non-integer.\n\nFrom our analysis:\n-   For the interval $(0, 5]$, any non-integer $c$ yields a non-integer flow value $f^{\\star}(c) = c+1$. The point $c=5$ itself is an integer, so it does not fall under the \"every non-integer $c$\" condition. Thus, the interval $[0, 5]$ is a candidate. Any $T \\leq 5$ will satisfy the property.\n\n-   Consider any value $T  5$. For instance, let $T = 5 + \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon  0$. The interval is $(0, 5+\\epsilon]$. We can choose a non-integer $c_0$ in this interval such that $5  c_0 \\leq 5+\\epsilon$. For example, $c_0 = 5 + \\epsilon/2$. For this $c_0$, $f^{\\star}(c_0) = 6$, which is an integer. This violates the required condition that for *every* non-integer `c` in the interval, the flow is non-integer.\n\nTherefore, no value of $T$ greater than $5$ can satisfy the condition. The largest possible value for $T$ is $5$.\n\nThe integrality property of network flows states that if all capacities are integers, the max flow value is an integer. Here, when $c  5$, the minimum cut is determined by edges with integer capacities, $C(s,b)=1$ and $C(a,t)=5$. Even though the network contains a non-integer capacity $c$, it is not the bottleneck, and the max flow value resolves to an integer. When $0  c \\leq 5$, the edge with non-integer capacity $c$ is part of the bottleneck cut, forcing the max flow value itself to be non-integer. The transition point is exactly where the two competing cuts have equal capacity, $c+1=6$, which is at $c=5$.\n\nThe largest real number $T$ for which the condition holds is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "3255308"}]}
