            "introduction": "Strange attractors often arise after a system undergoes a series of transformations from simple to complex behavior. One of the most famous pathways to chaos is the period-doubling cascade, which can be studied in a surprisingly simple model: the logistic map. This exercise  invites you to analyze the stability of this system's equilibrium states and pinpoint the exact moment—the first bifurcation point—where the system's behavior splits, marking the first step on the road to chaos. Mastering this analysis is key to understanding how deterministic systems can generate unpredictable dynamics.",

            "problem": "A simplified model for the yearly population of a certain species of firefly, normalized to the environment's carrying capacity, is given by the iterative map $x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)$. Here, $x_n$ represents the population density in year $n$, where $0 \\le x_n \\le 1$, and $r$ is a positive parameter representing the combined effects of reproduction and starvation. For a range of values of $r$, the population settles to a single, stable, non-zero equilibrium value year after year. As $r$ increases, a critical value $r_c$ is reached where this single equilibrium becomes unstable, and the population begins to oscillate, alternating between two distinct values each year. This phenomenon is known as a period-doubling bifurcation. Determine the exact value of the parameter $r_c$ at which this first period-doubling bifurcation occurs.",
            "solution": "We consider the logistic map $f(x) = r x (1 - x)$ with iteration $x_{n+1} = f(x_{n})$. Fixed points satisfy $x^{*} = f(x^{*})$, so\n$$\nx^{*} = r x^{*} (1 - x^{*}) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad x^{*} \\left( 1 - r + r x^{*} \\right) = 0.\n$$\nThus the fixed points are $x^{*} = 0$ and, for $r  0$, the nontrivial fixed point\n$$\nx^{*} = 1 - \\frac{1}{r}.\n$$\n\nLinear stability of a fixed point is determined by $|f'(x^{*})|  1$, where\n$$\nf'(x) = r(1 - 2x).\n$$\nEvaluating at the nontrivial fixed point,\n$$\nf'\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) = r\\left(1 - 2\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\right) = r\\left(-1 + \\frac{2}{r}\\right) = 2 - r.\n$$\nTherefore the stability condition becomes\n$$\n|2 - r|  1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad -1  2 - r  1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 1  r  3.\n$$\n\nA period-doubling (flip) bifurcation occurs when the fixed point loses stability via $f'(x^{*}) = -1$. Setting $2 - r = -1$ gives\n$$\nr_{c} = 3.\n$$\nFor $r  3$, the nonzero fixed point is unstable and a stable period-two orbit appears, indicating the first period-doubling bifurcation at $r = 3$.",

            "introduction": "For an attractor to exist, trajectories must converge toward a specific region of the phase space, implying that the overall volume occupied by a set of initial conditions must shrink over time. This property, known as dissipation, is a hallmark of systems with strange attractors, such as the famous Lorenz system modeling atmospheric convection. In this practice , you will calculate the divergence of the Lorenz system's vector field to prove that it is indeed dissipative. This fundamental calculation reveals how an infinite number of chaotic trajectories can remain confined within a finite, zero-volume set.",

            "introduction": "The \"strangeness\" of a strange attractor lies in its intricate, infinitely detailed geometric structure, which is characteristic of a fractal. Unlike familiar integer-dimensional objects like lines or surfaces, these attractors possess a non-integer fractal dimension.

            "problem": "Strange attractors in dissipative dynamical systems are sets in phase space towards which a system evolves over time. These sets often exhibit a complex, fractal structure. A key tool for characterizing this structure is the fractal dimension. For many self-similar attractors, the dimension can be calculated using an idealized model based on an Iterated Function System (IFS).\n\nConsider such a model: a one-dimensional, two-scale Cantor set. This set is constructed by a recursive procedure. One starts with the unit interval $[0, 1]$. In the first step, this interval is replaced by two disjoint sub-intervals of lengths $r_1$ and $r_2$. In each subsequent step, every existing interval is again replaced by two new disjoint sub-intervals, scaled down by the same factors $r_1$ and $r_2$. The construction is valid only if $r_1  0$, $r_2  0$, and $r_1 + r_2  1$ to ensure that gaps are formed at each step.\n\nThe similarity dimension $D$ of such a fractal is given by the unique solution to the Moran equation:\n$$\nr_1^D + r_2^D = 1\n$$\nNow, suppose the scaling factors are parameterized by an angle $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi/2)$ and an integer $n2$:\n$$\nr_1 = \\cos^n(\\theta) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_2 = \\sin^n(\\theta)\n$$\nDerive a general expression for the fractal dimension $D$ in terms of the integer $n$.
