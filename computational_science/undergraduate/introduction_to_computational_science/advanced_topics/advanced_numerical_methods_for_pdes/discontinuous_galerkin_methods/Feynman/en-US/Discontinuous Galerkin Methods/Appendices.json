This is the role of the numerical flux, which dictates how information is exchanged across element boundaries.

Then, compute the value of the Godunov numerical flux at the stationary interface $x=0$ in terms of $a$. Provide your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression in terms of $a$. No rounding is required, and no units are to be included.",
            "solution": "First, we analyze the exact weak solution to the given Riemann problem. The conservation law is $\\partial_t u + \\partial_x f(u) = 0$ with $f(u) = \\frac{1}{2}u^2$. The initial condition specifies a discontinuity at $x=0$, with a left state $u_L = a$ and a right state $u_R = -a$. Since $a>0$, we have $u_L > u_R$. For a convex flux function like $f(u) = \\frac{1}{2}u^2$ (since $f''(u) = 1 > 0$), the condition $u_L > u_R$ implies that the solution is a shock wave, provided the entropy condition is met.\n\nThe speed of this shock wave, $s$, is determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot condition:\n$$\ns = \\frac{f(u_L) - f(u_R)}{u_L - u_R} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}a^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(-a)^2}{a - (-a)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}a^2 - \\frac{1}{2}a^2}{2a} = \\frac{0}{2a} = 0\n$$\nThe shock speed is zero, meaning the shock is stationary and remains at $x=0$. The Lax entropy condition requires that characteristics flow into the shock, which means $f'(u_L) > s > f'(u_R)$. With $f'(u) = u$, this condition becomes $a > 0 > -a$, which is true for $a>0$. Thus, the exact weak solution is a stationary entropy-satisfying shock:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\na, & x < 0 \\\\\n-a, & x > 0\n\\end{cases} \\quad \\forall t \\ge 0\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the semi-discrete DG scheme. For polynomial degree $p=0$, the DG method is equivalent to a finite volume scheme. The unknown solution $u_h(x,t)$ is approximated by a piecewise constant function, with value $U_j(t)$ on each mesh element $I_j = [x_{j-1/2}, x_{j+1/2}]$. The semi-discrete equation for the cell average $U_j$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dU_j}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\Delta x_j} (\\hat{f}_{j+1/2} - \\hat{f}_{j-1/2})\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta x_j$ is the width of element $I_j$ and $\\hat{f}_{j+1/2} = \\hat{f}(U_j, U_{j+1})$ is the numerical flux at the interface $x_{j+1/2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the mesh is aligned with the discontinuity at $x=0$. This implies there is an interface, say $x_{k+1/2}$, such that $x_{k+1/2}=0$. The initial DG solution is the projection of the exact initial data onto the piecewise constant space. For any element $I_j$ entirely in $x<0$, $U_j(0)=a$. For any element $I_j$ entirely in $x>0$, $U_j(0)=-a$. So, $U_j(0)=a$ for $j \\le k$ and $U_j(0)=-a$ for $j \\ge k+1$. This discrete representation is exact for the piecewise constant solution.\n\nThe semi-discrete solution coincides with the exact solution for all time if and only if it remains stationary, i.e., $\\frac{dU_j}{dt}=0$ for all $j$. This requires the net flux for each cell to be zero: $\\hat{f}_{j+1/2} = \\hat{f}_{j-1/2}$.\n- For any cell $I_j$ with $j < k$, both its interfaces are in the region where the state is $a$. Thus $U_{j-1}=U_j=U_{j+1}=a$. By the consistency of the numerical flux, $\\hat{f}(u,u)=f(u)$, we have $\\hat{f}_{j+1/2} = f(a)$ and $\\hat{f}_{j-1/2} = f(a)$, so $\\frac{dU_j}{dt}=0$.\n- Similarly, for any cell $I_j$ with $j > k+1$, $U_{j-1}=U_j=U_{j+1}=-a$, so $\\hat{f}_{j+1/2} = f(-a)$ and $\\hat{f}_{j-1/2} = f(-a)$, yielding $\\frac{dU_j}{dt}=0$.\n- For the cell $I_k$ immediately to the left of the shock, the flux balance is $\\hat{f}_{k+1/2} = \\hat{f}_{k-1/2}$. This means $\\hat{f}(U_k, U_{k+1}) = \\hat{f}(U_{k-1}, U_k)$, which is $\\hat{f}(a, -a) = \\hat{f}(a,a) = f(a) = \\frac{1}{2}a^2$.\n- For the cell $I_{k+1}$ immediately to the right of the shock, the flux balance is $\\hat{f}_{k+3/2} = \\hat{f}_{k+1/2}$. This means $\\hat{f}(U_{k+1}, U_{k+2}) = \\hat{f}(U_k, U_{k+1})$, which is $\\hat{f}(-a, -a) = \\hat{f}(a,-a)$, or $f(-a) = \\hat{f}(a,-a)$. Since $f(-a) = \\frac{1}{2}(-a)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}a^2$, this gives the same condition.\nThus, the discrete solution remains stationary if and only if the numerical flux at the shock interface $x=0$ is $\\hat{f}(a, -a) = \\frac{1}{2}a^2$.\n\nThe problem specifies the Godunov flux. The Godunov flux $\\hat{f}^G(u_L, u_R)$ is obtained from the exact solution of the local Riemann problem. A general formula for the Godunov flux for a convex flux function $f(u)$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{f}^G(u_L, u_R) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\min_{u \\in [u_L, u_R]} f(u) & \\text{if } u_L \\leq u_R \\text{ (rarefaction case)} \\\\\n\\max_{u \\in [u_R, u_L]} f(u) & \\text{if } u_L > u_R \\text{ (shock case)}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIn our case, $u_L=a$ and $u_R=-a$, so $u_L > u_R$. We must find the maximum of $f(u)=\\frac{1}{2}u^2$ on the interval $[u_R, u_L] = [-a, a]$. The function $f(u)$ is a parabola opening upwards, so its maximum on a symmetric interval $[-a,a]$ must occur at the endpoints.\n$$\n\\hat{f}^G(a,-a) = \\max_{u \\in [-a, a]} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}u^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}a^2\n$$\nSince the Godunov flux $\\hat{f}^G(a,-a) = \\frac{1}{2}a^2$ satisfies the condition for stationarity, we can conclude that the semi-discrete DG solution does not evolve from its initial state. The initial DG solution is a piecewise constant representation of the exact weak solution. Therefore, the semi-discrete DG solution coincides with the exact weak solution for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe second part of the question asks for the value of the Godunov numerical flux at the stationary interface $x=0$. As computed above, this value is $\\frac{1}{2}a^2$.",

The volume integral gives the stiffness-like matrix $\\mathbf{D}$:\n    $$D_{mn} = \\int_{K_j} \\phi_n (\\partial_x \\phi_m) \\,dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\phi_n(\\xi)(\\partial_\\xi \\phi_m(\\xi))\\,d\\xi$$\n3.  The interface flux terms involve evaluating the basis functions at the boundaries $\\xi = \\pm 1$. The term at the right boundary $x_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}$ (where $\\xi=+1$) is $a \\phi_m(1) \\sum_n U_{j,n} \\phi_n(1)$. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^R$ be the column vector with entries $\\phi_m(1)$. This term becomes $a (\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^R \\boldsymbol{\\phi}^{R,T}) \\mathbf{U}_j = a \\mathbf{B}_r \\mathbf{U}_j$. The term at the left boundary $x_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}$ (where $\\xi=-1$) depends on the solution from the adjacent cell $j-1$, specifically $u_h(x_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}^-) = u_h(x_{(j-1)+\\frac{1}{2}}^-)$. This term is $-a \\phi_m(-1) \\sum_n U_{j-1,n} \\phi_n(1)$. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^L$ be the column vector with entries $\\phi_m(-1)$. This term becomes $-a (\\boldsymbol{\\phi}^L \\boldsymbol{\\phi}^{R,T}) \\mathbf{U}_{j-1} = -a \\mathbf{B}_l \\mathbf{U}_{j-1}$.\n\nCombining these terms, we have $\\mathbf{M} \\frac{d\\mathbf{U}_j}{dt} + a \\mathbf{B}_r \\mathbf{U}_j - a \\mathbf{B}_l \\mathbf{U}_{j-1} - a \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{U}_j = 0$, which rearranges to the form given in the problem:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} \\frac{d\\mathbf{U}_j}{dt} = a(\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{U}_j - \\mathbf{B}_r \\mathbf{U}_j + \\mathbf{B}_l \\mathbf{U}_{j-1})\n$$\nThe matrices $\\mathbf{M}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$ are assembled using Gaussian quadrature with $p+1$ points, which is exact for polynomials of degree up to $2(p+1)-1 = 2p+1$. This satisfies the problem's requirement.\n\nFor the Fourier analysis, we substitute the ansatz $\\mathbf{U}_j(t) = \\mathbf{v} e^{i j \\theta} e^{\\lambda t}$, where $\\theta$ is the non-dimensional wavenumber or cell-to-cell phase angle, and $\\lambda$ is the complex temporal growth rate.\n$$\n\\lambda \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v} e^{i j \\theta} e^{\\lambda t} = a(\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{v} e^{i j \\theta} e^{\\lambda t} - \\mathbf{B}_r \\mathbf{v} e^{i j \\theta} e^{\\lambda t} + \\mathbf{B}_l \\mathbf{v} e^{i (j-1) \\theta} e^{\\lambda t})\n$$\nDividing by $e^{i j \\theta} e^{\\lambda t}$ yields the generalized eigenvalue problem:\n$$\n\\lambda \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v} = a(\\mathbf{D} - \\mathbf{B}_r + e^{-i\\theta} \\mathbf{B}_l) \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the standard eigenvalue problem $\\lambda \\mathbf{v} = G(\\theta) \\mathbf{v}$, where $G(\\theta)$ is the block symbol:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = a \\mathbf{M}^{-1} (\\mathbf{D} - \\mathbf{B}_r + e^{-i\\theta} \\mathbf{B}_l)\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda_m(\\theta)$ of $G(\\theta)$ characterize the numerical scheme's behavior. The physical branch corresponds to the wave mode that should propagate. It is identified as the eigenvalue with the algebraically largest real part. If multiple eigenvalues share this maximum real part, a tie-breaking rule is necessary. We select the eigenvalue whose imaginary part is closest to that of the exact dispersion relation, $\\lambda_{\\text{exact}} = -ika = -i(\\theta/h)a$.\n\nFrom the selected physical eigenvalue $\\lambda(\\theta)$, the numerical wavenumber $k^\\ast(\\theta)$ and dissipation rate $\\sigma(\\theta)$ are defined as:\n$$\nk^\\ast(\\theta) = -\\frac{\\operatorname{Im}(\\lambda(\\theta))}{a}, \\quad \\sigma(\\theta) = -\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda(\\theta))\n$$\nThe implementation will construct the matrices for each given $p$, form $G(\\theta)$ for each given $\\theta$, solve for its eigenvalues, select the physical branch, and compute the resulting $k^\\ast$ and $\\sigma$.",
