The core task is to implement the Trotter-Suzuki approximation, a cornerstone technique for simulating Hamiltonians that do not have a simple analytical solution. You will also explore a crucial aspect of real-world quantum computation by introducing a simple error model to see how non-unitary effects can lead to a breakdown of probability conservation, a key feature of ideal quantum mechanics .",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional lattice with $N$ sites and periodic boundary conditions. The quantum state is represented by a complex vector $\\psi \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ with components $\\psi(x,t)$, where $x \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-1\\}$ indexes lattice sites and $t$ denotes time. The evolution is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation $i \\frac{d}{dt} \\lvert \\psi(t) \\rangle = H \\lvert \\psi(t) \\rangle$, where $H = T + V$ is a Hermitian Hamiltonian consisting of a kinetic (hopping) term $T$ and an on-site potential $V$. The kinetic term is $T = -J \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \\left( \\lvert x \\rangle \\langle x+1 \\rvert + \\lvert x+1 \\rangle \\langle x \\rvert \\right)$ with addition modulo $N$, and the potential is $V = \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} V_x \\lvert x \\rangle \\langle x \\rvert$ with $V_x = V_0 \\cos\\left( \\frac{2\\pi x}{N} \\right)$. The time evolution is approximated by first-order Trotterization: one discrete step of duration $\\Delta t$ applies $U_V = e^{-i V \\Delta t}$ followed by $U_T = e^{-i T \\Delta t}$ to the state. In exact arithmetic with perfect gates, the evolution operator is unitary and the norm $\\sum_x \\lvert \\psi(x,t) \\rvert^2$ is preserved at each step.\n\nTo study the impact of gate imperfections, model finite gate errors by a uniform leakage operator $L(\\delta) = (1-\\delta) I$ with $0 \\le \\delta \\ll 1$ applied immediately after each gate. This leakage models amplitude loss to degrees of freedom outside the simulated Hilbert space (computational subspace), and therefore is non-unitary on the simulated subspace. At each Trotter step, apply $U_V$, then $L(\\delta)$, then $U_T$, then $L(\\delta)$.\n\nStarting from the normalized initial condition $\\psi(x,0) = 1$ for $x=0$ and $\\psi(x,0) = 0$ for $x \\neq 0$, implement the above evolution for $M$ discrete steps. After each Trotter step $k$ (i.e., after the sequence $U_V$, $L(\\delta)$, $U_T$, $L(\\delta)$ is applied once), compute the norm $n_k = \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \\lvert \\psi(x,t_k) \\rvert^2$ and verify the norm preservation property in the error-free case. Quantify the drift due to finite gate errors by reporting the single metric $D = \\max_{1 \\le k \\le M} \\lvert 1 - n_k \\rvert$, the maximum absolute deviation of the norm from $1$ over all steps.\n\nUse dimensionless units for all quantities. Angles are dimensionless phases; no angle unit conversion is required.\n\nYour program must simulate the evolution and, for the parameter sets below, output the drift metric $D$ for each case. Round each reported $D$ to six decimal places. The final output must be a single line containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n\nTest suite (each tuple is $(N, J, V_0, \\Delta t, M, \\delta)$):\n- Case $1$: $(8, 1.0, 0.0, 0.10, 100, 0.0)$.\n- Case $2$: $(8, 1.0, 0.5, 0.05, 200, 0.0)$.\n- Case $3$: $(8, 1.0, 0.5, 0.05, 200, 1.0 \\times 10^{-4})$.\n- Case $4$: $(8, 1.0, 0.5, 0.05, 10, 5.0 \\times 10^{-2})$.\n- Case $5$: $(8, 1.0, 1.0, 0.50, 20, 0.0)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5]$), where each $D_i$ is the drift metric for Case $i$ rounded to six decimal places.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the simulation of a quantum system on a one-dimensional lattice and the quantification of norm deviation due to simulated gate errors. The process involves constructing the Hamiltonian, implementing the time evolution via Trotterization, and calculating a specific error metric.\n\n**1. System Representation**\n\nThe quantum state of the system is a vector $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$, where $N$ is the number of lattice sites. In the computational implementation, this is represented as a `numpy` array of size $N$ with a complex data type. The initial condition is $\\psi(x,0) = 1$ for $x=0$ and $\\psi(x,0) = 0$ otherwise, which corresponds to a state vector with a $1$ in the first component and $0$s elsewhere. This is a normalized state, i.e., $\\langle \\psi(0) \\mid \\psi(0) \\rangle = \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \\lvert \\psi(x,0) \\rvert^2 = 1$.\n\n**2. Hamiltonian and Evolution Operators**\n\nThe time evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation $i \\frac{d}{dt} \\lvert \\psi(t) \\rangle = H \\lvert \\psi(t) \\rangle$. For a small time step $\\Delta t$, the evolution operator is approximately $U(\\Delta t) \\approx e^{-i H \\Delta t}$. The Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of a kinetic term $T$ and a potential term $V$.\n\n- **Potential Operator ($V$):** The potential is an on-site term $V = \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} V_x \\lvert x \\rangle \\langle x \\rvert$, with $V_x = V_0 \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi x}{N})$. This operator is diagonal in the position basis $\\{\\lvert x \\rangle\\}$. The corresponding evolution operator, $U_V = e^{-i V \\Delta t}$, is also diagonal, with matrix elements $(U_V)_{xx} = e^{-i V_x \\Delta t}$. Its application to a state vector $\\psi$ is an efficient element-wise multiplication: $(\\psi')_x = e^{-i V_x \\Delta t} \\psi_x$.\n\n- **Kinetic Operator ($T$):** The kinetic term is a hopping term $T = -J \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \\left( \\lvert x \\rangle \\langle x+1 \\rvert + \\lvert x+1 \\rangle \\langle x \\rvert \\right)$, where addition is modulo $N$. In the position basis, this is a real, symmetric $N \\times N$ matrix. The diagonal elements are $0$, and the elements on the first super-diagonal and sub-diagonal are $-J$. Due to the periodic boundary conditions, the elements $T_{0,N-1}$ and $T_{N-1,0}$ are also $-J$. The evolution operator for the kinetic part is $U_T = e^{-i T \\Delta t}$. Since $T$ is not a diagonal matrix, its exponential must be computed using a numerical matrix exponentiation algorithm, such as the one provided by `scipy.linalg.expm`. The operators $T$ and $V$ are Hermitian, so $U_T$ and $U_V$ are unitary.\n\n**3. Trotterized Evolution with Errors**\n\nThe problem specifies a first-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition to approximate the full evolution operator $e^{-i(T+V)\\Delta t}$. A single step of the ideal evolution applies first $U_V$ and then $U_T$, resulting in the combined operator $U_{\\text{Trotter}} = U_T U_V$. Since $U_T$ and $U_V$ are unitary, their product $U_{\\text{Trotter}}$ is also unitary, which guarantees the conservation of the state norm: $\\lVert U_{\\text{Trotter}} \\psi \\rVert^2 = \\lVert \\psi \\rVert^2$.\n\nGate errors are modeled by a non-unitary leakage operator $L(\\delta) = (1-\\delta)I$, which is applied after each of the unitary gates. The evolution of the state vector $\\psi_k$ at step $k$ to $\\psi_{k+1}$ at step $k+1$ is given by:\n$$\n\\lvert \\psi_{k+1} \\rangle = L(\\delta) U_T L(\\delta) U_V \\lvert \\psi_k \\rangle\n$$\nThis operator is not unitary for $\\delta > 0$. Let $n_k = \\lVert \\psi_k \\rVert^2$ be the norm at step $k$. The norm evolves as:\n$$\nn_{k+1} = \\lVert L(\\delta) U_T L(\\delta) U_V \\psi_k \\rVert^2 = \\langle \\psi_k \\rvert U_V^\\dagger L(\\delta)^\\dagger U_T^\\dagger L(\\delta)^\\dagger L(\\delta) U_T L(\\delta) U_V \\lvert \\psi_k \\rangle\n$$\nSince $L(\\delta)$ is a scalar operator $(1-\\delta)I$, and $U_T, U_V$ are unitary, this simplifies to:\n$$\nn_{k+1} = (1-\\delta)^2 \\cdot (1-\\delta)^2 \\cdot \\langle \\psi_k \\rvert U_V^\\dagger U_T^\\dagger U_T U_V \\lvert \\psi_k \\rangle = (1-\\delta)^4 n_k\n$$\nStarting with $n_0=1$, the norm after $k$ steps is $n_k = ((1-\\delta)^4)^k = (1-\\delta)^{4k}$.\n\n**4. Simulation Algorithm and Metric Calculation**\n\nThe simulation algorithm proceeds as follows for each set of parameters $(N, J, V_0, \\Delta t, M, \\delta)$:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create the initial state vector $\\psi$, where $\\psi_0=1$ and $\\psi_x=0$ for $x>0$.\n2.  **Operator Construction:**\n    a. Construct the vector of potential values $V_x$ and from it the vector of multiplicative phase factors $e^{-i V_x \\Delta t}$.\n    b. Construct the $N \\times N$ kinetic matrix $T$.\n    c. Compute the kinetic evolution matrix $U_T = e^{-i T \\Delta t}$ once before the time-stepping loop.\n3.  **Time Evolution:** Loop for $k$ from $1$ to $M$:\n    a. Apply the potential evolution operator: $\\psi \\leftarrow U_V \\psi$ (element-wise multiplication).\n    b. Apply the first leakage operator: $\\psi \\leftarrow (1-\\delta) \\psi$ (scalar multiplication).\n    c. Apply the kinetic evolution operator: $\\psi \\leftarrow U_T \\psi$ (matrix-vector multiplication).\n    d. Apply the second leakage operator: $\\psi \\leftarrow (1-\\delta) \\psi$ (scalar multiplication).\n    e. After this full step, compute the norm squared $n_k = \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \\lvert \\psi_x \\rvert^2$.\n    f. Record the deviation for this step: $|1 - n_k|$.\n4.  **Metric Calculation:** The final drift metric $D$ is the maximum deviation recorded over all $M$ steps: $D = \\max_{1 \\le k \\le M} |1 - n_k|$.\n\nFor the cases where $\\delta=0$, the leakage operator is the identity operator, $L(0) = I$. The evolution is unitary, and the norm is conserved at every step. Therefore, the deviation $|1-n_k|$ should be $0$ within the limits of floating-point arithmetic precision. For cases where $\\delta>0$, the norm decays, and the deviation $|1 - n_k| = 1 - (1-\\delta)^{4k}$ increases with $k$. The maximum deviation will thus occur at the final step, $k=M$, giving $D = 1 - (1-\\delta)^{4M}$.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this algorithm. It iterates through each test case, performs the simulation, calculates $D$, and formats the results as specified.",

We assume $|\\psi\\rangle$ and $|\\phi\\rangle$ are normalized pure states.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The system is initialized in the state $|\\Psi_0\\rangle = |0\\rangle_a |\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **First Hadamard Gate**: A Hadamard gate $H$ is applied to the ancilla qubit.\n    $$ H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The state becomes:\n    $$ |\\Psi_1\\rangle = (H \\otimes I \\otimes I) |\\Psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_a + |1\\rangle_a) |\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |0\\rangle_a |\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle + |1\\rangle_a |\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle \\right) $$\n\n3.  **Controlled-SWAP Gate**: A controlled-SWAP (C-SWAP) gate is applied, using the ancilla as the control. The C-SWAP operation is defined as C-SWAP$|c\\rangle|x\\rangle|y\\rangle = |c\\rangle|y\\rangle|x\\rangle$ if $c=1$, and $|c\\rangle|x\\rangle|y\\rangle$ if $c=0$.\n    Applying this to $|\\Psi_1\\rangle$:\n    $$ |\\Psi_2\\rangle = \\text{C-SWAP} |\\Psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |0\\rangle_a |\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle + |1\\rangle_a |\\phi\\rangle |\\psi\\rangle \\right) $$\n\n4.  **Second Hadamard Gate**: Another Hadamard gate is applied to the ancilla.\n    $$ |\\Psi_3\\rangle = (H \\otimes I \\otimes I) |\\Psi_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( H|0\\rangle_a |\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle + H|1\\rangle_a |\\phi\\rangle |\\psi\\rangle \\right) $$\n    Substituting $H|0\\rangle_a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_a + |1\\rangle_a)$ and $H|1\\rangle_a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_a - |1\\rangle_a)$:\n    $$ |\\Psi_3\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (|0\\rangle_a + |1\\rangle_a) |\\psi\\rangle |\\phi\\rangle + (|0\\rangle_a - |1\\rangle_a) |\\phi\\rangle |\\psi\\rangle \\right] $$\n    We regroup the terms based on the ancilla's state:\n    $$ |\\Psi_3\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} |0\\rangle_a (|\\psi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle + |\\phi\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle) + \\frac{1}{2} |1\\rangle_a (|\\psi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle - |\\phi\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle) $$\n\n5.  **Measurement Probabilities**: We measure the ancilla in the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$. The projectors are $\\Pi_0 = |0\\rangle_a\\langle 0|_a$ and $\\Pi_1 = |1\\rangle_a\\langle 1|_a$. According to the Born rule, the probability $p_k$ of obtaining outcome $k$ is $p_k = \\langle\\Psi_3|\\Pi_k|\\Psi_3\\rangle$.\n\n    The probability of measuring $|0\\rangle$, denoted $p_0$, is the squared norm of the part of the state associated with $|0\\rangle_a$:\n    $$ p_0 = \\left\\| \\frac{1}{2} |0\\rangle_a (|\\psi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle + |\\phi\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle) \\right\\|^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\langle\\psi|\\langle\\phi| + \\langle\\phi|\\langle\\psi|\\right) \\left(|\\psi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle + |\\phi\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle\\right) $$\n    $$ p_0 = \\frac{1}{4} (\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|\\phi\\rangle + \\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle + \\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle + \\langle\\phi|\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle) $$\n    Since the states are normalized, $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle\\phi|\\phi\\rangle = 1$. The fidelity is $F = |\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle|^2$. Also, $\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle = (\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle)^*$.\n    $$ p_0 = \\frac{1}{4} (1 + |\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle|^2 + 1) = \\frac{1}{4}(2 + 2F) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + F) $$\n    The probability of measuring $|1\\rangle$, denoted $p_1$, is simply $1-p_0$:\n    $$ p_1 = 1 - p_0 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(1 + F) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - F) $$\n\n6.  **Fidelity Estimator**: We seek an unbiased estimator for $F$. Let us define a random variable $m$ for a single measurement outcome, assigning $m=+1$ if the ancilla is measured as $|0\\rangle$ and $m=-1$ if measured as $|1\\rangle$. This corresponds to measuring the Pauli-$Z$ observable $\\sigma_z$ on the ancilla. The expectation value of this variable is:\n    $$ E[m] = (+1) \\cdot p_0 + (-1) \\cdot p_1 = p_0 - p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(1+F) - \\frac{1}{2}(1-F) = F $$\n    The expectation value of a single measurement is the fidelity $F$. Therefore, after $M$ independent and identically distributed shots, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator for $F$:\n    $$ \\widehat{F} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^M m_i $$\n    where $m_i$ is the outcome of the $i$-th shot. The expectation value of the estimator is $E[\\widehat{F}] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{M}\\sum m_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum E[m_i] = \\frac{1}{M} (M \\cdot F) = F$.\n\n7.  **Variance of the Estimator**: For i.i.d. random variables, the variance of the sample mean is $\\text{Var}(\\widehat{F}) = \\frac{\\text{Var}(m)}{M}$. We compute the variance of a single outcome $m$:\n    $$ \\text{Var}(m) = E[m^2] - (E[m])^2 $$\n    The possible values for $m$ are $+1$ and $-1$, so $m^2=1$ in all cases. This means $E[m^2] = 1$. We already found $E[m]=F$.\n    $$ \\text{Var}(m) = 1 - F^2 $$\n    Therefore, the variance of the fidelity estimator is:\n    $$ \\text{Var}(\\widehat{F}) = \\frac{1-F^2}{M} $$\n\n#### Minimum Number of Shots\nThe problem requires that the estimator variance be no greater than a specified value $v$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\widehat{F}) \\le v \\implies \\frac{1-F^2}{M} \\le v $$\nSolving for $M$, and noting that $1-F^2 \\ge 0$ since $0 \\le F \\le 1$:\n$$ M \\ge \\frac{1-F^2}{v} $$\nSince the number of shots $M$ must be an integer, the minimum number of shots is the smallest integer satisfying this inequality, which is given by the ceiling function:\n$$ M_{\\min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1-F^2}{v} \\right\\rceil $$\nThe problem also imposes the constraint that at least one shot must be performed. This is relevant when $F=1$, which makes the numerator zero, yielding a raw shot count of $0$. We incorporate this with a $\\max$ function:\n$$ M_{\\min} = \\max\\left(1, \\left\\lceil \\frac{1-F^2}{v} \\right\\rceil\\right) $$\n\n#### Algorithmic Implementation\nThe program will execute the following steps for each test case:\n1.  Construct the complex state vectors $|\\psi\\rangle$ and $|\\phi\\rangle$ using the provided parameters. Normalization is performed as a safeguard, though the provided states are defined to be normalized.\n2.  Compute the inner product $\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle$. In NumPy, this is `np.vdot(psi, phi)`.\n3.  Calculate the exact fidelity $F = |\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle|^2$.\n4.  Use the derived formula to calculate the minimal integer number of shots $M_{\\min}$ required to achieve the target variance $v$.\n5.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of single-qubit quantum dynamics, is mathematically and algorithmically well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of requirements for a solvable computational task.\n\nThe objective is to reconstruct the Hamiltonian vector $\\mathbf{h}$ of a single-qubit system, described by $H = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{h}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, from noisy time-series data. The procedure involves simulating the system's evolution, modeling measurement noise, estimating time derivatives from the noisy data, and applying linear regression to infer $\\mathbf{h}$.\n\n**Step 1: Simulation of Exact Qubit Dynamics**\nThe evolution of the qubit's state, represented by the Bloch vector $\\mathbf{r}(t)$, is governed by the differential equation $\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{h} \\times \\mathbf{r}(t)$. This equation describes the precession of the vector $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ around the constant vector $\\mathbf{h}$ with an angular frequency $\\omega = \\|\\mathbf{h}\\|_2$. The exact analytical solution for $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ given an initial state $\\mathbf{r}(0)$ is provided by Rodrigues' rotation formula:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}(0)\\cos(\\omega t) + (\\hat{\\mathbf{h}} \\times \\mathbf{r}(0))\\sin(\\omega t) + \\hat{\\mathbf{h}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{h}} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(0))(1 - \\cos(\\omega t))\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{h}} = \\mathbf{h}/\\|\\mathbf{h}\\|_2$ is the unit vector along the Hamiltonian axis. We use this formula to compute the exact, noiseless Bloch vector $\\mathbf{r}(t_k)$ at discrete time points $t_k = k\\Delta t$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, N_t-1$.\n\n**Step 2: Simulation of Measurement Noise**\nIn a real experiment, the expectation values $\\langle \\sigma_j \\rangle_t = r_j(t)$ are not directly accessible. They are estimated from a finite number of projective measurements. For a measurement of the Pauli operator $\\sigma_j$ on a system in a state with expectation value $r_j(t)$, the outcomes are $\\{+1, -1\\}$. The probability of obtaining the outcome $+1$ is given by $p_+(t) = \\frac{1 + r_j(t)}{2}$.\nTo simulate this process, we perform $N$ independent trials (shots). The number of times the outcome $+1$ is observed, $n_+$, follows a binomial distribution, $n_+ \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p_+)$. The empirical estimate for the expectation value, $\\widehat{r}_j(t)$, is the sample mean of the outcomes:\n$$\n\\widehat{r}_j(t) = \\frac{n_+ \\cdot (+1) + (N - n_+) \\cdot (-1)}{N} = \\frac{2n_+ - N}{N}\n$$\nThis procedure is applied at each time $t_k$ for each component $\\{x, y, z\\}$ to generate the noisy time-series data $\\widehat{\\mathbf{r}}(t_k)$.\n\n**Step 3: Numerical Estimation of the Time Derivative**\nTo utilize the dynamical equation $\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{h} \\times \\mathbf{r}$, we must estimate the time derivative of the Bloch vector from the noisy, discrete data $\\widehat{\\mathbf{r}}(t_k)$. We employ a second-order central finite difference scheme, which offers a good balance between accuracy and noise amplification. For interior time points $t_k$ where $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, N_t-2\\}$, the derivative is estimated as:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}}(t_k) = \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathbf{r}}(t_{k+1}) - \\widehat{\\mathbf{r}}(t_{k-1})}{2\\Delta t}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Hamiltonian Estimation via Linear Regression**\nThe core of the reconstruction is to solve for $\\mathbf{h}$ from the dynamical equation. We rewrite the cross product as a matrix-vector multiplication: $\\mathbf{h} \\times \\mathbf{r}(t) = C(\\mathbf{r}(t))\\mathbf{h}$, where $C(\\mathbf{r})$ is the skew-symmetric matrix:\n$$\nC(\\mathbf{r}) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & r_z & -r_y\\\\\n-r_z & 0 & r_x\\\\\nr_y & -r_x & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting our noisy estimates for the state and its derivative, we obtain a set of approximate linear equations for each interior time point $t_k$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}}(t_k) \\approx C(\\widehat{\\mathbf{r}}(t_k))\\mathbf{h}\n$$\nBy stacking these $3$-dimensional vector equations for all $N_t-2$ interior points, we form a single large, overdetermined linear system of the form $A\\mathbf{h} \\approx \\mathbf{b}$. The design matrix $A$ is a tall matrix of size $(3(N_t-2)) \\times 3$, constructed by vertically stacking the individual $C(\\widehat{\\mathbf{r}}(t_k))$ matrices. The observation vector $\\mathbf{b}$ has size $(3(N_t-2)) \\times 1$ and is formed by stacking the estimated derivative vectors $\\widehat{\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}}(t_k)$.\nThe problem specifies using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to find the estimate $\\widehat{\\mathbf{h}}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, i.e., $\\|\\mathbf{b} - A\\widehat{\\mathbf{h}}\\|_2^2$. This solution is given formally by $\\widehat{\\mathbf{h}} = (A^T A)^{-1}A^T \\mathbf{b}$, though it is computed using more numerically stable algorithms such as QR decomposition.\n\n**Step 5: Error Quantification**\nFinally, the accuracy of the Hamiltonian reconstruction is quantified by calculating the Euclidean norm of the difference between the estimated vector $\\widehat{\\mathbf{h}}$ and the true vector $\\mathbf{h}_{\\text{true}}$:\n$$\ne = \\|\\widehat{\\mathbf{h}} - \\mathbf{h}_{\\text{true}}\\|_2\n$$\nThis entire procedure is repeated for each test case specified.",
