This is a standard and well-understood problem in operations research and computational economics.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the established mathematical theory of linear programming. The nutritional data and dietary requirements are reasonable and serve as a valid basis for the model. It does not violate any scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a standard-form linear program. The feasible region, defined by the intersection of linear inequalities, is convex and non-empty. The objective function is linear. Since the costs and decision variables are non-negative, the objective function is bounded below on the feasible region. The problem statement correctly asserts that a well-defined optimal solution exists for each specified price $c_{A}$.\n- **Objective**: The problem is specified with mathematical precision, using unambiguous variables, coefficients, and constraints. It is free of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem passes all validation criteria. It is self-contained, consistent, scientifically sound, and well-posed.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires solving a linear programming (LP) model for several instances, each defined by a different cost coefficient $c_A$ for the variable $x_A$. This is a sensitivity analysis on an objective function coefficient.\n\nThe LP model can be expressed in matrix form. Let the vector of decision variables be $\\mathbf{x} = [x_{A}, x_{C}, x_{B}, x_{R}, x_{Br}]^T$. The objective is to minimize the total cost $z = \\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{x}$, where the cost vector is $\\mathbf{c} = [c_{A}, 2.5, 1.2, 0.6, 0.8]^T$.\n\nThe constraints are of the form $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{b}$, where the constraint matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and the requirements vector $\\mathbf{b}$ are given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n240 & 200 & 180 & 220 & 55 \\\\\n3 & 35 & 12 & 4 & 4 \\\\\n22 & 5 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n10 & 0 & 12 & 1 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\quad\n\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2000 \\\\\n50 \\\\\n44 \\\\\n30\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe decision variables must also satisfy the non-negativity constraint $\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nTo solve this problem computationally, we use the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` library in Python. This function is designed to solve minimization problems of the form:\nMinimize $\\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{x}$ subject to $\\mathbf{A}_{ub} \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{b}_{ub}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{eq} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}_{eq}$, with bounds on $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nOur problem's constraints are of the \"greater than or equal to\" type, $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{b}$. These must be converted to the \"less than or equal to\" form required by the `linprog` function. This is achieved by multiplying the inequality by $-1$, which reverses the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{b} \\iff -\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\le -\\mathbf{b}\n$$\nTherefore, we will pass $\\mathbf{A}_{ub} = -\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{ub} = -\\mathbf{b}$ to the solver. The non-negativity constraint $x_i \\ge 0$ is handled by setting the `bounds` for each variable to $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe solution algorithm is as follows:\n1. Define the constant matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ as NumPy arrays.\n2. Define the list of test values for the avocado price $c_A$: $\\{1.00, 0.50, 10.00, 12.00, 25.00\\}$.\n3. Iterate through each value of $c_A$ in the test suite.\n4. In each iteration, construct the corresponding cost vector $\\mathbf{c}$.\n5. Call `scipy.optimize.linprog` with the cost vector $\\mathbf{c}$, the transformed constraint matrix $-\\mathbf{A}$, the transformed requirements vector $-\\mathbf{b}$, and the non-negativity bounds. The `highs` method is a modern, efficient, and robust choice for the solver.\n6. From the result object returned by the solver, extract the optimal quantity of avocado, $x_A^\\star$, which is the first element of the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}^\\star$, and the optimal minimum cost, $z^\\star$.\n7. Store the pair $[x_A^\\star, z^\\star]$.\n8. After processing all values of $c_A$, format the collected results into a single string as specified: a list of pairs, with each numerical value rounded to $4$ decimal places.\nThis procedure systematically performs the requested sensitivity analysis and produces the required output.",

The concepts of basic feasible solutions, reduced costs, and unboundedness are central to the simplex method and LP theory. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($A$, $b$, $c$, and the initial basis) to perform the required analysis. The language is objective and uses standard mathematical notation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks to diagnose whether the basic feasible solution (BFS) associated with the given basis $B$ certifies unboundedness and to compute the rate of increase of the objective function along the corresponding ray.\n\nFirst, we partition the matrix $A$ and vectors $x$ and $c$ according to the basic and nonbasic indices. The basic indices are $\\mathcal{B} = \\{1, 2\\}$ and nonbasic indices are $\\mathcal{N} = \\{3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe basis matrix $A_B$ consists of the first two columns of $A$, and the nonbasic matrix $A_N$ consists of the last two columns:\n$$\nA_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad A_N = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 \\\\ 2 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe variables and objective coefficients are partitioned similarly:\n$$\nx_B = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad x_N = \\begin{pmatrix} x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nc_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad c_N = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe first step is to find the basic solution corresponding to the basis $B$. This is done by setting the nonbasic variables to zero, $x_N = 0$, and solving for the basic variables $x_B$ from the equation $A_B x_B = b$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the first row, $2x_1 = 8$, which gives $x_1 = 4$.\nSubstituting into the second row, $4 + x_2 = 7$, which gives $x_2 = 3$.\nThe basic solution is $x_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since both components are non-negative ($4 \\ge 0$ and $3 \\ge 0$), this is a basic feasible solution (BFS). The full solution vector is $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$.\n\nNext, we check for unboundedness. According to the fundamental principles of the simplex method, the primal LP is unbounded if there exists a nonbasic variable $x_j$ (where $j \\in \\mathcal{N}$) such that:\n1.  Increasing $x_j$ from $0$ increases the objective function. For a maximization problem, this means its reduced cost $\\bar{c}_j$ must be positive.\n2.  As $x_j$ increases, the solution remains feasible. This means that all current basic variables $x_B$ remain non-negative.\n\nThe reduced cost for a nonbasic variable $x_j$ is given by the formula $\\bar{c}_j = c_j - c_B^T A_B^{-1} a_j$, where $a_j$ is the $j$-th column of $A$. Let's first compute the inverse of the basis matrix $A_B$:\n$$\n\\det(A_B) = (2)(1) - (0)(1) = 2\n$$\n$$\nA_B^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the reduced costs for the nonbasic variables $x_3$ and $x_4$. It is efficient to first compute the vector $y^T = c_B^T A_B^{-1}$:\n$$\ny^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3/2 + 1/2 & 0 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe reduced costs are $\\bar{c}_j = c_j - y^T a_j$:\nFor $j=3$: $a_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\bar{c}_3 = c_3 - y^T a_3 = 0 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 - (2 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 2) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nFor $j=4$: $a_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\bar{c}_4 = c_4 - y^T a_4 = 2 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 - (2 \\cdot (-4) - 1 \\cdot (-3)) = 2 - (-8 + 3) = 2 - (-5) = 7\n$$\nSince $\\bar{c}_4 = 7 > 0$, increasing $x_4$ will increase the objective function. So, $j=4$ is our candidate nonbasic index.\n\nNow we check the second condition. We consider a move from the current BFS $x^{(0)} = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$ in a direction where $x_4$ increases by a parameter $t \\ge 0$, i.e., $x_4(t) = t$. The other nonbasic variable $x_3$ remains $0$. The basic variables $x_B(t)$ adjust to maintain feasibility:\n$A_B x_B(t) + a_4 x_4(t) = b \\implies A_B x_B(t) = b - a_4 t$.\n$x_B(t) = A_B^{-1}(b - a_4 t) = A_B^{-1}b - (A_B^{-1}a_4)t$.\nSince $x_B = A_B^{-1}b$ is our current basic feasible solution, we have $x_B(t) = x_B - (A_B^{-1}a_4)t$.\nFor the solution to remain feasible for all $t > 0$, we must have $x_B(t) \\ge 0$. As $x_B > 0$, this condition is guaranteed if all components of the vector update $-A_B^{-1}a_4$ are non-negative, which is equivalent to every component of the vector $d_j = A_B^{-1}a_j$ being non-positive. Let's calculate $d_4 = A_B^{-1} a_4$:\n$$\nd_4 = A_B^{-1} a_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 2 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince all components of $d_4$ are negative (and thus non-positive), the condition is met. The basic variables evolve as:\n$$\nx_B(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} - t \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 + 2t \\\\ 3 + t \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor any $t \\ge 0$, both $x_1(t) = 4+2t$ and $x_2(t) = 3+t$ are non-negative.\nThe full solution vector along the ray is $x(t) = (4+2t, 3+t, 0, t)^T$. This path is feasible for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe problem is unbounded. The ray of unboundedness starts at $x^{(0)} = (4, 3, 0, 0)^T$ and extends in the direction $d = (2, 1, 0, 1)^T$.\nThe final step is to compute the rate of increase in the objective function $z = c^T x$ along this ray. The objective value as a function of the parameter $t$ is $z(t) = c^T x(t)$:\n$$\nz(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4+2t \\\\ 3+t \\\\ 0 \\\\ t \\end{pmatrix} = 3(4+2t) - 1(3+t) + 2t\n$$\n$$\nz(t) = 12 + 6t - 3 - t + 2t = (12-3) + (6-1+2)t = 9 + 7t\n$$\nThe value of the objective at the BFS is $z(0) = 9$. The objective increases linearly with $t$. The rate of increase of the objective per unit parameter $t$ (which corresponds to a unit increase in $x_4$) is the derivative of $z(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dz}{dt} = 7\n$$\nAs established by the theory, this rate of increase is precisely the reduced cost of the entering variable, $\\bar{c}_4$.\n\nThe exact scalar rate of increase is $7$.",
