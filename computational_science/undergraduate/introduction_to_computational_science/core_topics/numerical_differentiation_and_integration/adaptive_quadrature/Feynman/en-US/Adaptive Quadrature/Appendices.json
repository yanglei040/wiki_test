            "problem": "You are tasked with building a principled, self-contained program that implements an adaptive numerical integration scheme grounded in first principles for the trapezoidal rule. The core objective is to approximate the definite integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx$ for a series of test functions using an adaptive refinement strategy that estimates local error by comparing the trapezoidal approximation on the whole interval and the sum of trapezoidal approximations on its two halves.\n\nBegin from the definition of the definite integral as the limit of Riemann sums and the construction of the linear interpolant of $f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$. The trapezoidal rule for a single interval arises by integrating this linear interpolant over $[a,b]$. Your algorithm must:\n- On any subinterval $[a,b]$ with width $h=b-a$, compute the trapezoidal approximation on the whole interval and the combined trapezoidal approximation on its two halves $[a,m]$ and $[m,b]$ with $m=(a+b)/2$.\n- Use only the comparison between these two approximations (the whole interval versus the sum over two halves) to design a local error estimator, deduced from sound reasoning about how the local truncation error scales with interval width when the interval is halved. Do not assume or use any shortcut formulas not derived from this error-scaling reasoning.\n- Accept a subinterval if the estimated local error is below a prescribed tolerance, optionally using a bias-reduced corrected estimate derived from the same error-scaling principle; otherwise, split the interval and recurse on each half.\n- Ensure termination through a maximum recursion depth parameter $D_{\\max}$ and handle degenerate intervals with $a=b$ correctly.\n\nAngle units for any trigonometric function must be radians. There are no physical units in this problem. All numeric tolerances in the test suite are absolute tolerances.\n\nImplement your program to evaluate the following test suite. For each test case, compute the integral approximation using your adaptive trapezoidal scheme with the given tolerance, and aggregate the results into a single line of output in the specified format.\n\nTest Suite:\n1. $f(x)=\\sin(x)$ on $[0,\\pi]$ with tolerance $10^{-12}$.\n2. $f(x)=e^{-x^{2}}$ on $[0,1]$ with tolerance $10^{-12}$.\n3. $f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{1+x^{2}}$ on $[-5,5]$ with tolerance $10^{-10}$.\n4. $f(x)=|x|$ on $[-1,1]$ with tolerance $10^{-10}$.\n5. $f(x)=\\dfrac{\\sin(100x)}{1+x^{2}}$ on $[0,1]$ with tolerance $10^{-8}$.\n6. $f(x)=5$ on $[2,5]$ with tolerance $10^{-12}$.\n7. $f(x)=\\sin(x)$ on $[1,1]$ (zero-length interval) with tolerance $10^{-12}$.\n\nDesign for coverage:\n- The first case is a smooth periodic function over one full period.\n- The second case has a bell-shaped integrand with rapidly decaying tails within the interval.\n- The third case tests rational integrands over a symmetric large interval.\n- The fourth case tests a non-differentiable integrand at the midpoint.\n- The fifth case is oscillatory with moderate damping.\n- The sixth case is constant and should terminate immediately.\n- The seventh case is a boundary case with zero-length interval.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with no additional whitespace or text.

The core of the task is to derive an error estimation and refinement strategy from first principles, specifically by comparing a coarse approximation on an interval with a more refined one.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nLet the definite integral to be approximated be $I = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx$.\n\n**1. The Trapezoidal Rule from First Principles**\n\nThe trapezoidal rule approximates the integrand $f(x)$ with a linear polynomial $p_1(x)$ that interpolates the function at the endpoints of the interval $[a, b]$. The coordinates of these points are $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$. The linear interpolant is given by:\n$$p_1(x) = f(a) + \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}(x - a)$$\nThe integral of this linear polynomial over the interval $[a, b]$ provides the trapezoidal approximation, denoted as $T(a,b)$. Let $h = b - a$ be the width of the interval.\n$$T(a,b) = \\int_{a}^{b} p_1(x) \\,dx = \\int_{a}^{b} \\left( f(a) + \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{h}(x - a) \\right) \\,dx$$\n$$= \\left[ f(a)x + \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{h} \\left( \\frac{x^2}{2} - ax \\right) \\right]_{a}^{b}$$\n$$= f(a)(b-a) + \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{h} \\left( \\left(\\frac{b^2}{2} - ab\\right) - \\left(\\frac{a^2}{2} - a^2\\right) \\right)$$\n$$= f(a)h + \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{h} \\left( \\frac{b^2 - 2ab + a^2}{2} \\right) = f(a)h + \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{h} \\frac{(b-a)^2}{2}$$\n$$= f(a)h + (f(b) - f(a))\\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{h}{2}(2f(a) + f(b) - f(a)) = \\frac{h}{2}(f(a) + f(b))$$\nThis is the single-panel trapezoidal rule. Let's call this coarse approximation $S_1$.\n$$S_1 = \\frac{h}{2}(f(a) + f(b))$$\n\n**2. Error Estimation via Refinement**\n\nTo estimate the error, we compare $S_1$ with a more accurate approximation, $S_2$, obtained by splitting the interval $[a, b]$ into two subintervals of equal width, $[a, m]$ and $[m, b]$, where $m = (a+b)/2$. The width of each subinterval is $h/2$. The approximation $S_2$ is the sum of the trapezoidal rule applied to each subinterval:\n$$S_2 = T(a, m) + T(m, b) = \\frac{h/2}{2}(f(a) + f(m)) + \\frac{h/2}{2}(f(m) + f(b))$$\n$$S_2 = \\frac{h}{4}(f(a) + 2f(m) + f(b))$$\n\nThe local truncation error for the trapezoidal rule on an interval of width $w$ is given by $E(w) = -\\frac{w^3}{12}f''(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi$ in the interval, assuming $f$ is twice continuously differentiable. This shows that the error is proportional to the cube of the interval width, i.e., $E(w) \\approx Cw^3$.\n\nThe true integral $I$ can be related to our approximations $S_1$ and $S_2$ as follows:\n$I = S_1 + E(h) \\approx S_1 + Ch^3$\n$I = S_2 + E(h/2) + E(h/2) \\approx S_2 + 2C(h/2)^3 = S_2 + \\frac{Ch^3}{4}$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns, $I$ and $C$:\n$I - S_1 \\approx Ch^3$\n$I - S_2 \\approx \\frac{Ch^3}{4}$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first yields:\n$(I - S_2) - (I - S_1) \\approx \\frac{Ch^3}{4} - Ch^3 \\implies S_1 - S_2 \\approx -\\frac{3}{4}Ch^3$\n\nThis allows us to express the unknown term $Ch^3$ in terms of our computed quantities $S_1$ and $S_2$:\n$Ch^3 \\approx \\frac{4}{3}(S_2 - S_1)$\n\nThe error in the more accurate approximation, $E_2 = I - S_2$, can now be estimated.\n$E_2 \\approx \\frac{Ch^3}{4} \\approx \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{4}{3}(S_2 - S_1) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}(S_2 - S_1)$\n\nThe absolute local error for the refined approximation $S_2$ can thus be estimated as:\n$$\\text{err} \\approx \\frac{1}{3}|S_2 - S_1|$$\nThis estimator is derived solely from the comparison of the two approximations and the scaling property of the local error, as required.\n\n**3. Adaptive Algorithm and Bias Reduction**\n\nThe adaptive algorithm proceeds recursively. For a given interval $[a, b]$ and an absolute tolerance $\\tau$:\n1.  Calculate $S_1$, $S_2$, and the error estimate $\\text{err} = \\frac{1}{3}|S_2 - S_1|$.\n2.  If $\\text{err} < \\tau$, the interval is considered adequately approximated. The process for this branch terminates.\n3.  If $\\text{err} \\ge \\tau$, the interval is split into $[a, m]$ and $[m, b]$. The algorithm is then called recursively on each subinterval, with the tolerance budget split accordingly, typically $\\tau/2$ for each. The results from the recursive calls are summed.\n\nThe problem mentions using a \"bias-reduced corrected estimate\". This is an application of Richardson extrapolation. A better estimate for the true integral $I$ can be obtained by correcting $S_2$ with our error estimate $E_2$:\n$$I \\approx S_2 + E_2 \\approx S_2 + \\frac{1}{3}(S_2 - S_1) = \\frac{4S_2 - S_1}{3}$$\nThis corrected value is, in fact, Simpson's rule for the interval $[a,b]$:\n$$\\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{h}{4}(f(a) + 2f(m) + f(b)) \\right) - \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{h}{2}(f(a) + f(b)) \\right) = \\frac{h}{3}(f(a) + 2f(m) + f(b)) - \\frac{h}{6}(f(a) + f(b))$$\n$$= \\frac{h}{6} (2f(a) + 4f(m) + 2f(b) - f(a) - f(b)) = \\frac{h}{6}(f(a) + 4f(m) + f(b))$$\nWhen an interval is accepted (i.e., $\\text{err} < \\tau$), returning this higher-order Simpson's rule approximation provides a more accurate result for the same number of function evaluations.\n\n**4. Implementation Structure and Termination**\n\nThe algorithm is implemented as a recursive function. A wrapper function initializes the process.\n- **Base Cases for Recursion:**\n    1.  If $a = b$, the integral is $0$.\n    2.  A maximum recursion depth, $D_{\\max}$, is imposed to guarantee termination, even if the tolerance criterion is never met (e.g., for certain pathological functions or insufficient floating-point precision). If this depth is reached, the current best estimate for the subinterval is returned.\n\n- **Recursive Step:**\n    An internal function, `_adaptive_trapezoid(f, a, b, tol, fa, fb, depth)`, will perform the main logic. Passing `fa=f(a)` and `fb=f(b)` as arguments avoids redundant function evaluations at shared endpoints between parent and child intervals. If the error criterion is not met, it makes two recursive calls:\n    `_adaptive_trapezoid(f, a, m, tol/2, fa, fm, depth+1) + _adaptive_trapezoid(f, m, b, tol/2, fm, fb, depth+1)`\n    where $m=(a+b)/2$ and $fm=f(m)$. This structure efficiently and robustly implements the adaptive integration scheme.",

The context is the numerical approximation of a definite integral of a bounded function over a closed interval. The foundational base for this task consists of: (i) the definition of the Riemann integral as the limit of Riemann sums for a bounded function on a closed interval, (ii) interpolation-based composite quadrature rules derived from polynomial interpolation on equally spaced nodes, and (iii) the properties of floating-point arithmetic in double precision, particularly the concept of machine epsilon.\n\nTask requirements:\n- Implement an adaptive panel-refinement quadrature based on polynomial interpolation at three nodes per panel.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of numerical analysis. It provides a complete and consistent set of requirements for designing and implementing an adaptive quadrature algorithm with a robust stopping criterion for handling a function with a jump discontinuity. All parameters, the function to be integrated, and the test cases are specified unambiguously.\n\nThe solution is developed by synthesizing principles of numerical integration, error estimation, and floating-point arithmetic. The algorithm is a recursive, adaptive quadrature method based on Simpson's rule, augmented with a stopping criterion that ensures termination in the presence of discontinuities by respecting the limits of double-precision floating-point resolution.\n\nThe core components of the algorithm are as follows:\n\n1.  **Base Quadrature Rule: Simpson's Rule**\n    The problem specifies a quadrature rule based on polynomial interpolation at three nodes per panel. For a panel $[a, b]$, the standard choice of nodes is the endpoints $a$, $b$, and the midpoint $m = (a+b)/2$. The unique quadratic polynomial interpolating the function $f(x)$ at these points, $(a, f(a))$, $(m, f(m))$, and $(b, f(b))$, is integrated exactly to yield Simpson's rule. The approximation of the integral of $f(x)$ over $[a, b]$, denoted $S(a,b)$, is given by:\n    $$\n    S(a, b) = \\frac{b-a}{6} \\left( f(a) + 4f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) + f(b) \\right)\n    $$\n    Simpson's rule is exact for polynomials of degree up to $3$.\n\n2.  **Adaptive Refinement with Error Estimation**\n    The principle of adaptive quadrature is to refine panels only where the function is \"difficult\" to integrate, i.e., where the estimated integration error is large. This is achieved through a recursive process. For a given panel $[a, b]$, we compute a coarse approximation, $I_{parent} = S(a, b)$. We then subdivide the panel at its midpoint $m = (a+b)/2$ into two child panels, $[a, m]$ and $[m, b]$. A more refined approximation, $I_{children}$, is computed by summing the Simpson's rule results on each child panel:\n    $$\n    I_{children} = S(a, m) + S(m, b)\n    $$\n    The error of the coarse approximation, $S(a,b)$, is of order $\\mathcal{O}((b-a)^5)$, while the error of the refined approximation, $I_{children}$, is of order $\\mathcal{O}((m-a)^5 + (b-m)^5) = \\mathcal{O}(2 \\cdot (\\frac{b-a}{2})^5) = \\frac{1}{16}\\mathcal{O}((b-a)^5)$. This implies that the error of the refined approximation is approximately $1/16$ of the error of the coarse one. The difference between the two computed values can thus be used to estimate the error of the more accurate approximation, $I_{children}$:\n    $$\n    E_{children} \\approx \\frac{1}{15} |I_{children} - I_{parent}|\n    $$\n    The refinement is terminated for the panel $[a,b]$ if this estimated error is within a specified tolerance, $\\tau_{panel}$. A common strategy, which we adopt, is to check if $|I_{children} - I_{parent}| < 15 \\cdot \\tau_{panel}$. The global tolerance for the entire integration domain, denoted $\\tau$, is distributed to sub-panels. For bisection, a simple and effective method is to allocate half of the parent's tolerance to each child, so at each level of recursion for a panel, its tolerance is halved for its children.\n\n3.  **Robust Stopping Criterion for Discontinuities**\n    For a function with a jump discontinuity, like the specified Heaviside function $f(x) = H(x - 0.5)$, the error near the discontinuity at $x=0.5$ does not decrease at the expected rate with panel refinement. The error estimate will consistently fail the tolerance check, leading to unbounded recursion as the algorithm attempts to resolve the jump. To guarantee termination, a robust stopping criterion based on the limits of floating-point arithmetic is necessary. The specified criterion has two components, checked at the beginning of each recursive step for a panel $[a, b]$ of width $h=b-a$:\n    \n    a. **Minimum Panel Width ($h_{min}$)**: Refinement is halted if the panel width $h$ becomes smaller than a prescribed minimum, $h_{min}$. This minimum is defined relative to the scale of the interval endpoints and the machine precision, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}}$ (the smallest number such that $1.0 + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}} > 1.0$ in floating-point arithmetic).\n    $$\n    h_{\\min} = \\beta \\cdot \\max(1, |a|, |b|) \\cdot \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}}\n    $$\n    With the given parameter $\\beta=256$, this establishes a floor for panel width, preventing infinite subdivision. If $h \\le h_{min}$, we cease recursion.\n\n    b. **Floating-Point Resolution Limit**: As $a$ and $b$ become very close, their midpoint $m = (a+b)/2$ may be computationally indistinguishable from $a$ or $b$. If $m=a$ or $m=b$, further subdivision is mathematically impossible in the given floating-point system. This condition serves as a fundamental backstop.\n\n    If either of these conditions is met, refinement on the current panel is terminated, and the refined approximation, $I_{children}$, is accepted as the result for that panel. A boolean flag is returned to indicate that this special termination was triggered.\n\n4.  **Algorithm Synthesis**\n    The complete algorithm is implemented as a recursive function. A main entry function, `adaptive_quadrature(func, a, b, tol)`, sets up the initial panel and tolerance and calls a recursive helper function.\n    The recursive helper, `_recursive_quad(func, a, b, tol_sub, ...)`, performs the following steps for its given panel:\n    i. Check the robust stopping criterion. If met, return the child-panel approximation $I_{children}$ and a `true` flag.\n    ii. Compute the parent $I_{parent}$ and child $I_{children}$ approximations.\n    iii. Calculate the error estimate $|I_{children} - I_{parent}|$.\n    iv. If the error is within the panel's tolerance ($< 15 \\cdot \\tau_{sub}$), return $I_{children}$ and a `false` flag.\n    v.

The recursive, divide-and-conquer nature of adaptive quadrature is perfectly suited for parallel execution. This exercise guides you through a simulation of a parallel implementation, using worker threads and a shared task queue to understand how these complex integration tasks can be distributed for significant speedups.

            "problem": "Consider a parallel adaptive quadrature algorithm designed to approximate the definite integral of a function $f(x)$. The algorithm uses two worker threads, T1 and T2, which retrieve tasks from a shared work queue. The work queue is structured as a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) stack. Each item in the queue is a tuple `(interval, tolerance)`, representing a sub-problem.\n\nThe algorithm is tasked with approximating the integral of the function $f(x) = x^{2}\\exp(-x)$ over the initial interval $[0, 5]$ with a total initial tolerance of $\\epsilon_{total} = 0.01$.\n\nThe core of the adaptive algorithm for an interval $[a, b]$ with a given tolerance $\\epsilon_{interval}$ is as follows:\n1.  Calculate a coarse approximation using Simpson's rule: $S(a,b) = \\frac{b-a}{6}\\left[f(a) + 4f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) + f(b)\\right]$.\n2.  Let $m = (a+b)/2$. Calculate a more refined approximation by summing the Simpson's rule results over the two sub-intervals: $I_{refined} = S(a,m) + S(m,b)$.\n3.  Estimate the error as $E = |I_{refined} - S(a,b)|$.\n4.  If $E < \\epsilon_{interval}$, the interval is considered \"accepted\". The value $I_{refined}$ is added to a global total, and processing for this interval is complete.\n5.  If $E \\geq \\epsilon_{interval}$, the interval is \"rejected\". The problem is subdivided by adding two new work items to the top of the LIFO stack: first `([m, b], \\epsilon_{interval}/2)` is pushed, and then `([a, m], \\epsilon_{interval}/2)` is pushed.\n\nThe parallel execution follows these rules:\n- The process starts with a single item in the work queue: `([0, 5], 0.01)`.\n- The simulation proceeds in discrete time steps.\n- At the beginning of a step, any idle thread attempts to pop an item from the work queue. If an item is successfully popped, the thread becomes busy for the duration of that step.\n- A busy thread performs the error-checking procedure described above. By the end of the step, if the interval was accepted, the thread becomes idle. If the interval was rejected, the thread pushes the two new sub-problems onto the stack and then becomes idle.\n- Thread T1 is available to take work at the beginning of Step 1. Thread T2 is available to take work at the beginning of Step 2. If both threads attempt to pop from the queue in the same step, assume T1's pop action occurs before T2's.\n\nYour task is to trace this parallel process. Determine the sum of the lengths of all intervals remaining in the work queue at the end of the step in which the second interval is accepted.\n\nRound your final answer to four significant figures.",
