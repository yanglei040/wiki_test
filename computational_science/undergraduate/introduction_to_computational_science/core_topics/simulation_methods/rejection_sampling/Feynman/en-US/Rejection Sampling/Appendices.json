The efficiency of any rejection sampler is determined by its acceptance probability, which hinges on how tightly the proposal distribution, $g(x)$, envelops the target distribution, $f(x)$. This first exercise guides you through calculating this theoretical probability for a common scenario: sampling from a Beta distribution using a simple uniform proposal. By finding the optimal constant $M$ and using it to find the acceptance rate, you'll practice the core mechanical steps of setting up a rejection sampler.",

This leads to a dramatic decrease in the acceptance probability. This highlights the inefficiency of rejection sampling when the proposal is poorly centered on a sharp target mode.\n- **Dependence on variance inflation $\\kappa_1$**: The role of $\\kappa_1$ is more nuanced. For a fixed non-zero $\\delta$, as $\\kappa_1 \\to 1^+$, the exponent in $\\alpha_1$ goes to $+\\infty$, making the sampler extremely inefficient (e.g., test case 8). This is because a proposal that is just as narrow as the target cannot effectively cover any misalignment. Increasing $\\kappa_1$ (i.e., using a \"fatter\" proposal) mitigates the effect of misalignment $\\delta$. However, a very large $\\kappa_1$ also increases the baseline factor $\\sqrt{\\kappa_1}$ in $\\alpha_1$, reducing efficiency even when $\\delta=0$. For any given $\\delta \\ne 0$, there exists an optimal $\\kappa_1 > 1$ that minimizes $\\alpha_1$ and maximizes efficiency. The perfect alignment case ($\\delta=0, \\kappa_1=1$) yields the highest possible acceptance rate, which becomes $1$ if the mixture weights $c_1, c_2$ are chosen optimally to balance the modes.",
