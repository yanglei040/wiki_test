            "introduction": "The most direct way to learn the Euler method is to apply it. This first exercise  guides you through the fundamental process of taking discrete steps to approximate the solution of an initial value problem. By calculating the solution at each point, you will gain a feel for the iterative nature of the method and how the local slope at each point determines the next.",

            "problem": "In a simplified model for the dynamics of a specialized electrical component, the time evolution of a certain phase angle $y(t)$ (measured in radians) is described by the differential equation $y' = t + \\sin(y)$. Here, $t$ is time measured in seconds. The initial state of the system at $t=0$ is given by $y(0) = \\pi$.\n\nYour task is to approximate the value of the phase angle at $t=0.2$ seconds. Use Euler's method with a step size of $h=0.1$ to perform this approximation.\n\nProvide your final answer in radians, rounded to five significant figures.",

This practice  presents a scenario where the result of a single Euler step is known, but the step size $h$ is not.

            "problem": "A student is working on a numerical methods assignment and uses the Euler method to approximate the solution to a first-order ordinary differential equation.

After performing a single step of the Euler method, the student records the new value as $y_1 = 17$, but forgets to write down the step size, $h$, that was used.

This exercise  powerfully illustrates this by asking you to compare the outcomes for two different step sizes on the same problem.
