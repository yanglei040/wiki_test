            "problem": "The shooting method is a powerful technique for solving boundary value problems (BVP) by reformulating them as initial value problems (IVP). For a second-order ordinary differential equation of the form $u'' = f(x, u, u')$ with boundary conditions $u(x_0) = \\alpha$ and $u(x_1) = \\beta$, one treats the initial slope, $s = u'(x_0)$, as a parameter. The solution to the IVP, denoted $u(x; s)$, will then depend on this choice of $s$. The goal is to find the specific value of $s$ such that the second boundary condition is met, i.e., $u(x_1; s) = \\beta$. The existence of such an $s$ is often guaranteed by the Intermediate Value Theorem, assuming $u(x_1; s)$ is a continuous function of $s$.\n\nWhile this process is typically numerical, certain specially constructed nonlinear BVPs are amenable to an exact analytical solution. Consider the following BVP on the interval $x \\in [0, 1]$:\n$$\nu'' = \\frac{\\pi^2}{8}(u + u^3)\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $u(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 1$.\n\nDetermine the exact positive value of the initial slope $s = u'(0)$ for which the solution of the corresponding initial value problem also satisfies the boundary condition at $x=1$.",

            "problem": "Consider the boundary value problem (BVP) for a scalar function $y(x)$ on the interval $[0,1]$ given by the second-order ordinary differential equation $y''(x)=y(x)^3$ with boundary conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y(1)=B$, where $B$ is a real parameter. The shooting method reduces this BVP to solving an initial value problem with an unknown initial slope $s=y'(0)$ and defining a residual map $F(s)=y(1;s)-B$, where $y(x;s)$ denotes the solution of the initial value problem $y''=y^3$, $y(0)=0$, $y'(0)=s$. A solution to the BVP corresponds to a root of $F(s)=0$. Starting from the fundamental definitions of ordinary differential equations and the shooting method, and using well-tested facts from calculus (energy integrals and monotonicity derived from separable forms), derive the qualitative behavior of the map $s \\mapsto y(1;s)$ for the nonlinear equation $y''=y^3$. In particular, address whether multiple distinct values of $s$ can satisfy $y(1)=B$ for a fixed $B$, and discuss how a robust root-finding algorithm navigates potential multiple solution branches.\n\nYour program must:\n- Implement the shooting method by numerically integrating the initial value problem $y'(x)=v(x)$, $v'(x)=y(x)^3$ with $y(0)=0$ and $v(0)=s$ to $x=1$, and computing $F(s)=y(1;s)-B$.\n- Use a bracketing-based root-finder to solve $F(s)=0$ for $s$, expanding brackets adaptively to ensure a sign change.\n- For each test case specified below, compute a numerical approximation of the initial slope $s$ that satisfies the boundary condition at $x=1$.\n\nThere are no physical units involved in this problem.

            "solution": "The task is to solve the boundary value problem $y''(x) = y(x)^3$ on the interval $x \\in [0, 1]$, with boundary conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y(1)=B$. The core of the problem lies in understanding the properties of the shooting function, which maps the initial slope $s=y'(0)$ to the final position $y(1;s)$.\n\n#### Qualitative Analysis of the Map $s \\mapsto y(1;s)$\n\nLet $g(s) = y(1;s)$ be the map we wish to analyze.\n\n**1. Energy Integral and Sign Behavior**\nWe can derive a first integral of the motion for the ODE $y'' = y^3$ by multiplying by $y'$:\n$$ y'(x) y''(x) = y(x)^3 y'(x) $$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ from $0$ to $x$ yields:\n$$ \\int_0^x \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(y'(\\tau))^2\\right) d\\tau = \\int_0^x \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}y(\\tau)^4\\right) d\\tau $$\nApplying the fundamental theorem of calculus and the initial conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=s$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(y'(x))^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(y'(0))^2 = \\frac{1}{4}y(x)^4 - \\frac{1}{4}y(0)^4 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(y'(x))^2 - \\frac{1}{2}s^2 = \\frac{1}{4}y(x)^4 - 0 $$\nThis gives the \"energy conservation\" law:\n$$ (y'(x))^2 = \\frac{1}{2}y(x)^4 + s^2 $$\nFrom this relation, we can infer the sign of the solution $y(x;s)$:\n-   If $s=0$, the equation becomes $(y')^2 = \\frac{1}{2}y^4$. With ICs $y(0)=0$, $y'(0)=0$, the unique solution is the trivial one: $y(x;0) = 0$ for all $x$. Thus, $g(0) = y(1;0) = 0$.\n-   If $s > 0$, then $y'(0) > 0$. The right-hand side $\\frac{1}{2}y^4 + s^2$ is always positive. Therefore, $y'(x)$ can never be zero and must maintain its initial positive sign. So, for $s>0$, $y'(x)>0$ for all $x$. Since $y(0)=0$, the function $y(x)$ is strictly increasing, which implies $y(x;s) > 0$ for $x>0$. Consequently, $g(s) = y(1;s) > 0$.\n-   If $s  0$, then $y'(0)  0$. Similarly, $y'(x)$ must remain negative. The function $y(x)$ is strictly decreasing, which implies $y(x;s)  0$ for $x>0$. Consequently, $g(s) = y(1;s)  0$.\n\nIn summary, the function $g(s)$ is sign-preserving: $g(s)$ has the same sign as $s$.\n\n**2. Monotonicity and Uniqueness of Solutions**\nTo determine if multiple values of $s$ can lead to the same $y(1)=B$, we analyze the derivative of $g(s)$, i.e., $g'(s) = \\frac{d}{ds}y(1;s)$. Let $z(x;s) = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s}(x;s)$. We can find the differential equation governing $z$ by differentiating the original IVP with respect to $s$:\n-   ODE: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}(y'' - y^3) = 0 \\implies z'' - 3y^2 z = 0$, so $z''(x) = 3y(x;s)^2 z(x)$.\n-   IC 1: $z(0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}y(0;s) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}(0) = 0$.\n-   IC 2: $z'(0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}y'(0;s) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}(s) = 1$.\n\nThis is a linear, homogeneous, second-order ODE for $z(x)$. The coefficient $q(x) = 3y(x;s)^2$ is always non-negative. Since $z(0)=0$ and $z'(0)=1$, $z(x)$ starts increasing from zero. For $x > 0$ where $z(x)>0$, the term $z''(x) = q(x)z(x)$ must be non-negative, which indicates that $z(x)$ is convex. A convex function starting at $0$ with a positive slope must remain positive for all $x>0$. Thus, $z(x;s) > 0$ for all $x > 0$.\nIn particular, at $x=1$, we have $g'(s) = z(1;s) > 0$. Since the derivative of $g(s)$ is always positive, the function $g(s)=y(1;s)$ is strictly increasing for all $s$ where it is defined.\n\n**Conclusion**: For any real number $B$, the equation $y(1;s)=B$ can have at most one solution for $s$. There are no multiple solution branches. This significantly simplifies the root-finding task.\n\n**3. Finite-Time Blow-up and Robust Root-Finding**\nThe separable form of the energy integral, $y' = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}y^4+s^2}$ (for $s>0$), can be written as $dx = \\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}y^4+s^2}}$. The time $x$ to reach a state $y$ is $x(y) = \\int_0^y \\frac{d\\tilde{y}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{y}^4+s^2}}$. The integral to $y \\to \\infty$ converges to a finite value, $x_{bu}(s)$, meaning the solution blows up to infinity at a finite $x$. The larger $|s|$, the faster $y$ grows, and the smaller $x_{bu}(s)$ becomes.\nThis implies there exists a critical value $|s_{crit}|$ such that $x_{bu}(|s_{crit}|)=1$. For any $|s| \\ge |s_{crit}|$, the solution to the IVP becomes infinite at or before $x=1$. Therefore, the domain of our map $g(s)$ is the open interval $(-s_{crit}, s_{crit})$. Within this domain, $g(s)$ is strictly increasing from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.\nThis proves that for any finite $B$, there exists exactly one value of $s$ solving $y(1;s)=B$.\n\nA robust root-finding algorithm should not be concerned with multiple roots, but with the finite domain of $g(s)$. A bracketing method (like bisection or Brent's method) is ideal due to the proven monotonicity. The main challenge is finding an initial bracket $[s_a, s_b]$ that lies within $(-s_{crit}, s_{crit})$. An adaptive search for the bracket must correctly interpret a failure of the numerical ODE integrator (which occurs if a trial $s$ is outside the domain) as an indication that $y(1;s)$ is effectively infinite, thus helping to bound the root.\n\n**4. Symmetry**\nLet $y_s(x)$ denote the solution for initial slope $s$. Now, let $u(x) = -y_s(x)$. We find $u''(x) = -y_s''(x) = -y_s^3 = (-(-y_s(x)))^3 = (-u)^3 = -u^3$. This is a different ODE. The correct symmetry is to consider the solution for slope $-s$: $y_{-s}(x)$. Let $v(x) = -y_{-s}(x)$. Then $v(0)=-y_{-s}(0)=0$, $v'(0)=-y'_{-s}(0)=-(-s)=s$. And $v''(x) = -y''_{-s}(x) = -(y_{-s}(x))^3 = -(-v(x))^3 = v^3(x)$. So $v(x)$ solves the same IVP as $y(x;s)$. By uniqueness, $y(x;s)=v(x)=-y_{-s}(x)$. At $x=1$, this gives $g(s) = -g(-s)$, showing $g(s)$ is an odd function. This implies that if $s_B$ is the solution for $y(1)=B$, then $-s_B$ is the solution for $y(1)=-B$.\n\n#### Numerical Implementation\nBased on this analysis, the numerical approach is:\n1.  Represent the second-order ODE as a system of two first-order ODEs: let $\\mathbf{u} = [y, v]^T = [y, y']^T$. Then $\\mathbf{u}' = [v, y^3]^T$. The initial condition is $\\mathbf{u}(0) = [0, s]^T$.\n2.  For a given $B$, define the residual function $F(s) = y(1;s) - B$. This function uses a numerical integrator, such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, to compute $y(1;s)$.\n3.  Implement an adaptive bracketing search. For $B>0$, we know $s>0$. We can fix one end of the bracket at $s_a=0$ (where $F(0, B) = -B  0$) and search for an $s_b > 0$ such that $F(s_b, B) > 0$. The search must handle integration failures, which indicate $s_b$ is beyond the blow-up point and can serve as an upper bound. A similar strategy applies for $B0$.\n4.  Use a robust bracketing root-finder, like Brent's method (`scipy.optimize.root_scalar` with `method='brentq'`), to find the unique root within the determined bracket.",

The characteristic equation is $r^2 + 1 = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm i$.\nThe general solution is of the form:\n$$y(x) = C_1 \\cos(x) + C_2 \\sin(x)$$\nWe apply the initial conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nFrom $y(0) = 0$:\n$$y(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 \\cdot 1 + C_2 \\cdot 0 = C_1$$\nSo, $C_1 = 0$. The solution simplifies to $y(x) = C_2 \\sin(x)$.\n\nNext, we use the second initial condition, $y'(0) = s$. First, we find the derivative of $y(x)$:\n$$y'(x) = C_2 \\cos(x)$$\nNow, apply the condition at $x=0$:\n$$y'(0) = C_2 \\cos(0) = C_2 \\cdot 1 = C_2$$\nSo, $C_2 = s$.\n\nSubstituting the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution, we obtain the unique solution to the IVP for a given shooting angle $s$:\n$$y(x; s) = s \\sin(x)$$\nNow, we must check if this solution satisfies the terminal boundary condition, $y(\\pi) = 0$.

The general solution for $-y'' = \\lambda y$ is $y(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. Applying $y(0)=0$ gives $A=0$. The solution is $y(x) = B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. Applying $y(\\pi)=0$ gives $B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0$), we require $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi) = 0$, which means $\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi = n\\pi$ for an integer $n \\geq 1$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = n^2$. For $n=1$, we get the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$, with the corresponding eigenfunction $\\sin(x)$. The given BVP corresponds exactly to this case. Any solution must be a multiple of the eigenfunction, i.e., $y(x) = A \\sin(x)$. Our IVP solution $y(x;s) = s \\sin(x)$ is precisely of this form. The irrelevance of $s$ is that any multiple of the eigenfunction is a valid solution, so there is no unique non-trivial solution to determine. This statement correctly identifies the fundamental reason for the observed behavior.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. If one defines the shooting residual $R(s) = y(\\pi; s) - 0$ and applies a Newton update in $s$, then $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s$ is identically $0$, so the update cannot change $s$.**\nThe residual function is $R(s) = y(\\pi; s) = s \\sin(\\pi) = 0$. Since $R(s)$ is the constant function $0$, its derivative with respect to $s$ is also identically $0$: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}s} = 0$. Newton's method for finding a root of $R(s)=0$ requires the update step $s_{k+1} = s_k - R(s_k) / (\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s)$. In our case, this becomes $s_{k+1} = s_k - 0/0$, which is an undefined expression. Therefore, the method fails and cannot produce a new value for $s$. The statement accurately describes this breakdown.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Replacing $y'' + y$ by $y'' + (1 + \\varepsilon)y$ for any small positive $\\varepsilon$ preserves the property that $y(\\pi; s) = 0$ for all $s$.**\nLet's consider the perturbed problem $y'' + (1 + \\varepsilon)y = 0$ with $\\varepsilon  0$. Let $\\omega^2 = 1+\\varepsilon$. The general solution is $y(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\omega x) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega x)$. Applying the IVP conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=s$, we find $C_1=0$ and $C_2 = s/\\omega$. The solution is $y(x; s) = \\frac{s}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega x)$. At $x=\\pi$, we have $y(\\pi; s) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon}} \\sin(\\pi\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon})$. For this to be zero for all $s$, we would need $\\sin(\\pi\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon}) = 0$. This would imply $\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon}$ must be an integer. But for small $\\varepsilon  0$, $\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon}$ is a number slightly greater than $1$ but not an integer. Thus, $\\sin(\\pi\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon}) \\neq 0$. Consequently, $y(\\pi; s) = 0$ only if $s=0$. The property is not preserved.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. The space of functions that satisfy both boundary conditions is one-dimensional and given by $\\{A \\sin x : A \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, so $s$ plays the role of a free amplitude parameter.**\nAs shown in the analysis for option C, any function satisfying the BVP ($y''+y=0, y(0)=0, y(\\pi)=0$) must be of the form $y(x) = A \\sin(x)$ for some real constant $A$. This set of functions is a vector space spanned by the single function $\\sin(x)$, so it is one-dimensional. The solution to the IVP (shooting problem) was found to be $y(x; s) = s \\sin(x)$. By comparing the two forms, we see that the shooting parameter $s$ is identical to the amplitude parameter $A$. Since $A$ can be any real number, $s$ is a free parameter. This statement provides a clear and correct description of the structure of the solution space and the role of $s$.\n**Verdict: Correct**",
