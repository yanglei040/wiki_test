For each subinterval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, the spline segment $S_i(x)$ is a cubic polynomial. The entire spline $S(x)$ must satisfy the following properties:\n1.  **Interpolation**: $S(x_i) = y_i$ for all $i=0, \\ldots, n-1$.\n2.  **Continuity**: $S(x)$ is twice continuously differentiable on $[x_0, x_{n-1}]$, i.e., $S \\in C^2[x_0, x_{n-1}]$. This implies that at each interior knot $x_i$ ($i=1, \\ldots, n-2$), $S_{i-1}(x_i) = S_i(x_i)$, $S'_{i-1}(x_i) = S'_i(x_i)$, and $S''_{i-1}(x_i) = S''_i(x_i)$.\n\nLet us define the second derivatives of the spline at the knots as $M_i = S''(x_i)$ for $i=0, \\ldots, n-1$. Since each segment $S_i(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, its second derivative $S_i''(x)$ is a linear function. On the interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, $S_i''(x)$ passes through the points $(x_i, M_i)$ and $(x_{i+1}, M_{i+1})$. Let $h_i = x_{i+1} - x_i$. The linear function $S_i''(x)$ can be written using Lagrange's linear interpolation formula:\n$$\nS_i''(x) = M_i \\frac{x_{i+1} - x}{h_i} + M_{i+1} \\frac{x - x_i}{h_i}\n$$\nIntegrating $S_i''(x)$ twice with respect to $x$ gives the general form of the cubic polynomial $S_i(x)$:\n$$\nS_i(x) = M_i \\frac{(x_{i+1} - x)^3}{6h_i} + M_{i+1} \\frac{(x - x_i)^3}{6h_i} + C(x-x_i) + D(x_{i+1}-x)\n$$\nwhere $C$ and $D$ are constants of integration, expressed in a form convenient for applying the interpolation conditions.\nWe enforce the interpolation conditions $S_i(x_i) = y_i$ and $S_i(x_{i+1}) = y_{i+1}$:\nAt $x=x_i$: $y_i = M_i \\frac{h_i^3}{6h_i} + D h_i \\implies D = \\frac{y_i}{h_i} - \\frac{M_i h_i}{6}$.\nAt $x=x_{i+1}$: $y_{i+1} = M_{i+1} \\frac{h_i^3}{6h_i} + C h_i \\implies C = \\frac{y_{i+1}}{h_i} - \\frac{M_{i+1} h_i}{6}$.\n\nSubstituting these constants back, we obtain the expression for the spline segment $S_i(x)$ in terms of the known data points and the unknown second derivatives $M_i$:\n$$\nS_i(x) = \\frac{M_i}{6h_i}(x_{i+1}-x)^3 + \\frac{M_{i+1}}{6h_i}(x-x_i)^3 + \\left(\\frac{y_{i+1}}{h_i} - \\frac{M_{i+1}h_i}{6}\\right)(x-x_i) + \\left(\\frac{y_i}{h_i} - \\frac{M_i h_i}{6}\\right)(x_{i+1}-x)\n$$\nThis equation defines the spline on each subinterval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ for $i=0, \\ldots, n-2$. To find the unknown values $M_i$, we use the continuity condition for the first derivative, $S'_{i-1}(x_i) = S'_i(x_i)$, at the interior knots $x_i$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n-2$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative $S'_i(x)$:\n$$\nS'_i(x) = -\\frac{M_i}{2h_i}(x_{i+1}-x)^2 + \\frac{M_{i+1}}{2h_i}(x-x_i)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y_{i+1}}{h_i} - \\frac{M_{i+1}h_i}{6}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{y_i}{h_i} - \\frac{M_i h_i}{6}\\right)\n$$\nEvaluating the derivatives at the knots:\n$S'_i(x_i) = -\\frac{M_i h_i}{2} + \\frac{y_{i+1}-y_i}{h_i} - \\frac{M_{i+1}h_i}{6} + \\frac{M_i h_i}{6} = \\frac{y_{i+1}-y_i}{h_i} - \\frac{h_i}{3}M_i - \\frac{h_i}{6}M_{i+1}$.\n$S'_{i-1}(x_i) = \\frac{M_{i-1}h_{i-1}}{6} + \\frac{M_i h_{i-1}}{3} + \\frac{y_i-y_{i-1}}{h_{i-1}}$.\n\nEquating $S'_{i-1}(x_i) = S'_i(x_i)$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n-2$:\n$$\n\\frac{y_i-y_{i-1}}{h_{i-1}} + \\frac{h_{i-1}}{6}M_{i-1} + \\frac{h_{i-1}}{3}M_i = \\frac{y_{i+1}-y_i}{h_i} - \\frac{h_i}{3}M_i - \\frac{h_i}{6}M_{i+1}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to group the unknowns $M_{i-1}$, $M_i$, and $M_{i+1}$:\n$$\nh_{i-1}M_{i-1} + (2h_{i-1} + 2h_i)M_i + h_iM_{i+1} = 6\\left(\\frac{y_{i+1}-y_i}{h_i} - \\frac{y_i-y_{i-1}}{h_{i-1}}\\right)\n$$\nThis fundamental relation provides a system of $n-2$ linear equations for the $n$ unknowns $M_0, \\ldots, M_{n-1}$. To obtain a unique solution, we need two additional equations, which are provided by the boundary conditions.\n\n### Boundary Conditions\n\n**1. Natural Spline:**\nThe natural boundary condition specifies zero curvature at the endpoints: $S''(x_0)=0$ and $S''(x_{n-1})=0$. This directly translates to:\n$$\nM_0 = 0, \\quad M_{n-1} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these into the general system leaves $n-2$ equations for the $n-2$ unknowns $M_1, \\ldots, M_{n-2}$. The system forms a strictly diagonally dominant tridiagonal matrix, guaranteeing a unique solution.\n\n**2. Clamped Spline:**\nThe clamped boundary condition specifies the first derivatives at the endpoints: $S'(x_0)=s_0$ and $S'(x_{n-1})=s_{n-1}$.\nUsing our expression for $S'_i(x_i)$, we set $i=0$:\n$S'(x_0) = S'_0(x_0) = \\frac{y_1-y_0}{h_0} - \\frac{h_0}{3}M_0 - \\frac{h_0}{6}M_1 = s_0$.\nRearranging gives the first boundary equation:\n$$\n2h_0M_0 + h_0M_1 = 6\\left(\\frac{y_1-y_0}{h_0} - s_0\\right)\n$$\nFor the condition at $x_{n-1}$, we evaluate $S'_{n-2}(x_{n-1})=s_{n-1}$:\n$S'_{n-2}(x_{n-1}) = \\frac{y_{n-1}-y_{n-2}}{h_{n-2}} + \\frac{h_{n-2}}{6}M_{n-2} + \\frac{h_{n-2}}{3}M_{n-1} = s_{n-1}$.\nRearranging gives the second boundary equation:\n$$\nh_{n-2}M_{n-2} + 2h_{n-2}M_{n-1} = 6\\left(s_{n-1} - \\frac{y_{n-1}-y_{n-2}}{h_{n-2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies particular values for $s_0$ and $s_{n-1}$:\n$s_0 = \\frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0} = \\frac{y_1 - y_0}{h_0}$\n$s_{n-1} = \\frac{y_{n-1} - y_{n-2}}{x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}} = \\frac{y_{n-1} - y_{n-2}}{h_{n-2}}$\nWith these choices, the right-hand sides of both boundary equations become zero:\n$2h_0M_0 + h_0M_1 = 0 \\implies 2M_0 + M_1 = 0$.\n$h_{n-2}M_{n-2} + 2h_{n-2}M_{n-1} = 0 \\implies M_{n-2} + 2M_{n-1} = 0$.\nThese two equations, combined with the $n-2$ interior equations, form a full $n \\times n$ tridiagonal system for the unknowns $M_0, \\ldots, M_{n-1}$. This system is also strictly diagonally dominant and has a unique solution.\n\n### Overshoot Calculation\n\nThe overshoot magnitude on a subinterval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta_i = \\max\\left\\{ \\max_{x \\in [x_i,x_{i+1}]} \\left(S(x) - \\max\\{y_i,y_{i+1}\\}\\right), \\ \\max_{x \\in [x_i,x_{i+1}]}\\left(\\min\\{y_i,y_{i+1}\\} - S(x)\\right), \\ 0 \\right\\}\n$$\nThe global overshoot is the maximum over all subintervals, $\\Delta = \\max_i \\Delta_i$. Computationally, the maxima on each subinterval are approximated by evaluating the spline $S(x)$ on a fine uniform grid of $1001$ points spanning $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$. This procedure quantifies the extent to which the spline oscillates beyond the range of the data points it interpolates.",
