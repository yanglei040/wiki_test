            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution for the final requested quantity. We shall proceed by addressing each of the three tasks in sequence.\n\n## Task 1: Dataset Construction and Verification\n\nThe first task is to construct a mean-zero dataset with at least $n=4$ samples whose sample covariance matrix is exactly $C=\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. We are given the definition of the sample covariance for mean-zero data as $C=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{\\top}$.\n\nLet us choose the minimum specified sample size, $n=4$. The condition becomes $C=\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{\\top}$, which implies we need to find four vectors $\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that:\n$1$. The data is mean-zero: $\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n$2$. The sum of outer products is: $\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{\\top} = 3C = 3\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 6 \\\\ 6 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nA systematic way to construct such a dataset is to use the spectral properties of the covariance matrix $C$. The eigenvectors of $C$ represent the principal axes of the data's variance. Let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $C$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(C-\\lambda I)=0$.\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 3-\\lambda & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (3-\\lambda)^2 - 4 = 0\n$$\nThis gives $3-\\lambda = \\pm 2$, so the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 3+2=5$ and $\\lambda_2 = 3-2=1$.\n\nFor the first eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1 = 5$, the eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{u}_1$ is found by solving $(C-5I)\\boldsymbol{u}_1=\\boldsymbol{0}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_{11} \\\\ u_{12} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -2u_{11} + 2u_{12} = 0 \\implies u_{11} = u_{12}\n$$\nThe corresponding unit eigenvector is $\\boldsymbol{u}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor the second eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2 = 1$, the eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{u}_2$ is found by solving $(C-1I)\\boldsymbol{u}_2=\\boldsymbol{0}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_{21} \\\\ u_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies 2u_{21} + 2u_{22} = 0 \\implies u_{21} = -u_{22}\n$$\nThe corresponding unit eigenvector is $\\boldsymbol{u}_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe spectral decomposition of $C$ is $C = \\lambda_1 \\boldsymbol{u}_1 \\boldsymbol{u}_1^\\top + \\lambda_2 \\boldsymbol{u}_2 \\boldsymbol{u}_2^\\top$.\nWe require $\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{\\top} = 3C = 3\\lambda_1 \\boldsymbol{u}_1 \\boldsymbol{u}_1^\\top + 3\\lambda_2 \\boldsymbol{u}_2 \\boldsymbol{u}_2^\\top$.\nLet's construct a symmetric, mean-zero set of points aligned with these eigenvectors:\n$\\boldsymbol{x}_1 = a\\boldsymbol{u}_1$, $\\boldsymbol{x}_2 = -a\\boldsymbol{u}_1$, $\\boldsymbol{x}_3 = b\\boldsymbol{u}_2$, $\\boldsymbol{x}_4 = -b\\boldsymbol{u}_2$.\nThe mean is $\\boldsymbol{x}_1+\\boldsymbol{x}_2+\\boldsymbol{x}_3+\\boldsymbol{x}_4 = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The sum of outer products is:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{\\top} = (a\\boldsymbol{u}_1)(a\\boldsymbol{u}_1)^\\top + (-a\\boldsymbol{u}_1)(-a\\boldsymbol{u}_1)^\\top + (b\\boldsymbol{u}_2)(b\\boldsymbol{u}_2)^\\top + (-b\\boldsymbol{u}_2)(-b\\boldsymbol{u}_2)^\\top = 2a^2 \\boldsymbol{u}_1 \\boldsymbol{u}_1^\\top + 2b^2 \\boldsymbol{u}_2 \\boldsymbol{u}_2^\\top$.\nComparing this with $3\\lambda_1 \\boldsymbol{u}_1 \\boldsymbol{u}_1^\\top + 3\\lambda_2 \\boldsymbol{u}_2 \\boldsymbol{u}_2^\\top$ yields:\n$2a^2 = 3\\lambda_1 = 3(5)=15 \\implies a^2 = \\frac{15}{2} \\implies a = \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{2}}$.\n$2b^2 = 3\\lambda_2 = 3(1)=3 \\implies b^2 = \\frac{3}{2} \\implies b = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n\nSo, our concrete dataset is:\n$\\boldsymbol{x}_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{2}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\boldsymbol{x}_2 = -\\boldsymbol{x}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\boldsymbol{x}_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\boldsymbol{x}_4 = -\\boldsymbol{x}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nVerification: The dataset is mean-zero by construction. Let's compute $\\sum \\boldsymbol{x}_i \\boldsymbol{x}_i^\\top$. Let $\\boldsymbol{x}_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2})^\\top$.\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_{i1}^2 = (\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2})^2 + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2})^2 + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{30+6}{4} = \\frac{36}{4}=9$.\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_{i2}^2 = (\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2})^2 + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2})^2 + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = 9$.\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_{i1}x_{i2} = (\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2})(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}) + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}})(-\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}}) + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}})(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}) + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}})(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}) = \\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{15}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{30-6}{4} = \\frac{24}{4}=6$.\nSo, $\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 6 \\\\ 6 & 9 \\end{pmatrix} = 3C$. The sample covariance is $\\frac{1}{3}\\sum \\boldsymbol{x}_i \\boldsymbol{x}_i^\\top = C$, as required.\n\n## Task 2: Extremal Variance Directions via Constrained Optimization\n\nWe want to find the extrema of the projected variance $f(\\boldsymbol{u}) = \\boldsymbol{u}^{\\top}C\\,\\boldsymbol{u}$ subject to the constraint $g(\\boldsymbol{u}) = |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2 - 1 = \\boldsymbol{u}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{u} - 1 = 0$. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{u}, \\lambda) = \\boldsymbol{u}^{\\top}C\\,\\boldsymbol{u} - \\lambda(\\boldsymbol{u}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{u} - 1)\n$$\nTo find the stationary points, we set the gradient with respect to $\\boldsymbol{u}$ to zero:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{u}} \\mathcal{L} = 2C\\boldsymbol{u} - 2\\lambda\\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the eigenvalue equation:\n$$\nC\\boldsymbol{u} = \\lambda\\boldsymbol{u}\n$$\nThis shows that the unit vectors $\\boldsymbol{u}$ that extremize the projected variance are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $C$. The Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ is the corresponding eigenvalue.\nThe value of the projected variance at an eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is $\\boldsymbol{u}^{\\top}C\\,\\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{u}^{\\top}(\\lambda\\boldsymbol{u}) = \\lambda(\\boldsymbol{u}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{u})$. Given the constraint $\\boldsymbol{u}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{u}=1$, the projected variance is simply the eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n\nFrom Task 1, we found the eigenvalues of $C$ to be $\\lambda_1 = 5$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$.\nThe maximum projected variance is the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max} = 5$. The direction that achieves this maximum is the corresponding eigenvector, which is the first principal component: $\\boldsymbol{u}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (and its negative).\nThe minimum projected variance is the smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\min} = 1$. The direction that achieves this minimum is the second principal component: $\\boldsymbol{u}_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (and its negative).\n\n## Task 3: Proportion of Total Variance\n\nThe final task is to compute the proportion of the total variance captured by the first principal component. The first principal component is the direction that maximizes the projected variance, which we found to be $\\boldsymbol{u}_1$. The variance captured by this component is the maximal projected variance, $\\lambda_1 = 5$.\n\nThe total variance of the dataset is the sum of the variances along each dimension, which is the trace of the covariance matrix, $\\operatorname{Tr}(C)$.\n$$\n\\text{Total Variance} = \\operatorname{Tr}(C) = C_{11} + C_{22} = 3+3 = 6\n$$\nNote that this is also equal to the sum of the eigenvalues: $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 5+1=6$, as expected.\n\nThe proportion of the total variance captured by the first principal component is the ratio of the variance along that component to the total variance:\n$$\n\\text{Proportion} = \\frac{\\text{Variance of PC1}}{\\text{Total Variance}} = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\operatorname{Tr}(C)} = \\frac{5}{6}\n$$\nThis fraction is in its simplest form.",

For each case, consider a real-valued data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ with $d=3$ features and $n$ samples. Define $X$ deterministically by explicit formulas for each test case below. The task is to compare Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on the mean-centered data and on the standardized data, and to quantify how the dominant principal component direction and its explained variance fraction change due to standardization.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem that is valid and requires a solution. The problem statement is scientifically grounded in the fields of linear algebra and statistics, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is well-posed, providing deterministic instructions for constructing the data, defining all necessary mathematical objects and procedures, and requesting a set of specific, computable quantities. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. Therefore, a reasoned, step-by-step solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of PCA performed on mean-centered data versus standardized data for three distinct cases. The core of the problem lies in observing how scaling affects the outcome of PCA. PCA identifies the directions of maximum variance in a dataset. When features (columns of the data matrix) have vastly different scales, the feature with the largest variance will dominate the first principal component, regardless of the underlying data structure. Standardization, which rescales each feature to have a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$, prevents this by placing all features on an equal footing.\n\nThe overall procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For each test case, construct the $n \\times d$ data matrix $X$, where $d=3$.\n$2$. Perform PCA on the mean-centered data $X_c$.\n    a. Compute the column-wise sample mean vector $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n    b. Center the data: $X_c = X - \\mathbf{1}\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}^\\top$.\n    c. Compute the sample covariance matrix $S = \\frac{1}{n-1} X_c^\\top X_c$.\n    d. Find the eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ and eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}_k$ of $S$ by solving the eigenproblem $S\\mathbf{v}_k = \\lambda_k\\mathbf{v}_k$. The eigenvalues are sorted, $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3$, and the eigenvectors $\\{\\mathbf{v}_k\\}$ are orthonormal. The first principal component direction is $\\mathbf{v}_1$.\n    e. Compute the explained variance ratio for the first component: $r_1 = \\lambda_1 / (\\sum_{j=1}^d \\lambda_j)$.\n    f. Identify the original feature that dominates $\\mathbf{v}_1$: $i_{\\mathrm{before}} = \\arg\\max_{j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}} |(\\mathbf{v}_1)_j|$.\n\n$3$. Perform PCA on the standardized data $Z$.\n    a. Compute the column-wise sample standard deviations, $\\sigma_j$, of $X$ using a divisor of $n-1$.\n    b. Construct the standardized data matrix $Z$. Each column $Z_{:,j}$ is obtained by scaling the corresponding centered column $X_{c,:,j}$ by $1/\\sigma_j$. If $\\sigma_j=0$, the column $Z_{:,j}$ is set to a zero vector.\n    c. Compute the sample covariance matrix of $Z$: $S^{(z)} = \\frac{1}{n-1} Z^\\top Z$. This matrix is equivalent to the sample correlation matrix of $X$. Its diagonal entries are $1$ for any non-constant feature.\n    d. Find the eigenvalues $\\mu_k$ and eigenvectors $\\mathbf{u}_k$ of $S^{(z)}$, sorted such that $\\mu_1 \\ge \\mu_2 \\ge \\mu_3$. The first principal component direction of the standardized data is $\\mathbf{u}_1$.\n    e. Compute the corresponding explained variance ratio: $r_1^{(z)} = \\mu_1 / (\\sum_{j=1}^d \\mu_j)$. The sum in the denominator, $\\text{Tr}(S^{(z)})$, equals the number of non-constant features.\n    f.

Compare the results from the two analyses by computing the alignment metric $a = |\\mathbf{v}_1^\\top \\mathbf{u}_1|$, which measures the cosine of the angle between the two principal directions.\n\n$5$. For each case, the final output is the ordered list $[r_1, r_1^{(z)}, a, i_{\\mathrm{before}}, i_{\\mathrm{after}}]$.\n\nCase-specific analysis:\n- **Case 1**: The data consists of three features with scales $O(10^3)$, $O(1)$, and $O(10^{-3})$. The variance of the first feature, $x_1 = 1000 \\cos(2\\pi t_i)$, will be overwhelmingly larger than the others. Thus, the first principal component $\\mathbf{v}_1$ of the unstandardized data is expected to align almost perfectly with the first feature axis. This will yield $r_1 \\approx 1$ and $i_{\\mathrm{before}} = 0$. After standardization, all features have unit variance, and the structural relationship (an elliptical trajectory in the $(x_1, x_2)$ plane) will become apparent. The variance will be distributed more equitably, leading to a smaller $r_1^{(z)}$, and $\\mathbf{u}_1$ will be a combination of features $1$ and $2$.\n- **Case 2**: The first feature, $x_1 = 10^6 t_i$, has a massive scale. The second feature, $x_2=0$, is constant and has zero variance. The third feature, $x_3 = 10(t_i-0.5)$, has a much smaller scale than the first. For the unstandardized data, PCA will be dominated by feature $1$, giving $r_1 \\approx 1$ and $i_{\\mathrm{before}}=0$. After standardization, the constant feature $x_2$ remains a zero vector. Features $1$ and $3$ are both linear functions of $t_i$ and will become perfectly correlated after centering and scaling. Their standardized versions will be identical, $Z_{:,1} = Z_{:,3}$. The data will collapse onto a single direction in the $(Z_1, Z_3)$ plane. This will result in $r_1^{(z)}=1$ (as the effective rank is $1$ among the non-constant features) and an eigenvector $\\mathbf{u}_1$ of the form $[1/\\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/\\sqrt{2}]^\\top$.\n- **Case 3**: The first feature, $x_1 = 1000(2t_i-1)$, has a large scale. The second feature, $x_2 = (2t_i-1) + 0.1 \\sin(3\\pi t_i)$, is highly correlated with the first but has a much smaller scale. The third feature is of negligible scale. As with the other cases, unstandardized PCA will be dictated by the first feature's scale, so $r_1 \\approx 1$ and $i_{\\mathrm{before}}=0$. After standardization, the strong linear relationship between features $1$ and $2$ will be the most prominent characteristic. The first principal component $\\mathbf{u}_1$ will capture this shared variance, representing a direction along the major axis of the correlated cloud, roughly at a $45$-degree angle between the standardized axes of features $1$ and $2$.\n\nThe implementation will utilize `numpy` for all numerical computations, particularly `numpy.linalg.eigh` for the eigendecomposition of the symmetric covariance matrices. Care will be taken to handle the sorting of eigenvalues in descending order and the case of zero standard deviation.",

For each matrix, construct an anonymized representation by replacing the original features with the first $k$ principal components, defined as follows.

Define the column means $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ by $\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{ij}$ for $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,d\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and found to be self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. It presents a clear and formal definition of a standard procedure for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), complete with a deterministic sign convention for eigenvectors to ensure a unique solution. The problem is well-posed and its components are based on established principles of linear algebra and statistics. We shall therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented follows the precise steps laid out in the problem specification. Given a data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ with $n$ observations and $d$ features, and a non-negative integer $k$, the anonymized representation $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$ is constructed as follows.\n\n1.  **Mean Centering of Data**:\n    First, we compute the mean of each feature (column). The mean vector $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is defined by its components $\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{ij}$ for $j=1, \\dots, d$.\n    The data matrix $X$ is then centered by subtracting this mean vector from each observation (row). This yields the centered data matrix $X_c = X - \\mathbf{1}\\mu^{\\top}$, where $\\mathbf{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a column vector of ones. Each column of $X_c$ has a mean of $0$.\n\n2.  **Sample Covariance Matrix**:\n    Next, we compute the sample covariance matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$. This is given by the formula $S = \\frac{1}{n-1} X_c^{\\top} X_c$. The use of the factor $\\frac{1}{n-1}$ corresponds to Bessel's correction for an unbiased estimate of the population covariance. This is well-defined as all test cases satisfy $n > 1$.\n\n3.  **Eigendecomposition of the Covariance Matrix**:\n    We then find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix $S$. This is achieved by solving the eigenvalue problem $S v = \\lambda v$. This yields $d$ eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs $(\\lambda_1, v_1), (\\lambda_2, v_2), \\dots, (\\lambda_d, v_d)$. The eigenvalues are sorted in non-increasing order, $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\cdots \\ge \\lambda_d \\ge 0$. The corresponding eigenvectors $v_j$ are chosen to have unit norm, i.e., $\\|v_j\\|_2 = 1$.\n\n4.  **Unique Sign Convention for Eigenvectors**:\n    Since an eigenvector $v_j$ and its negative $-v_j$ are equivalent, a deterministic sign convention is imposed to ensure a unique result. For each eigenvector $v_j$, we find the index $p(j)$ of the element with the largest absolute value. The problem specifies that $p(j)$ should be the smallest such index if there are ties: $p(j) = \\min(\\arg\\max_{\\ell \\in \\{1,\\dots,d\\}} |(v_j)_\\ell|)$. If the element at this index, $(v_j)_{p(j)}$, is negative, the eigenvector's sign is flipped: $v_j \\leftarrow -v_j$.\n\n5.  **Projection onto Principal Components**:\n    The first $k$ eigenvectors, post-normalization, form the columns of the projection matrix $V_k = [v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k}$. The final anonymized data, also known as the principal component scores, is obtained by projecting the centered data onto these principal directions: $Z = X_c V_k$. The resulting matrix $Z$ has dimensions $n \\times k$. If $k=0$, $V_0$ is a $d \\times 0$ matrix, resulting in $Z$ being an $n \\times 0$ empty matrix.\n\nThe implementation will be a direct translation of this procedure into Python code using the `numpy` library for numerical computations. A function will encapsulate these steps, process each test case provided, and format the output according to the specified rounding and layout rules.",
