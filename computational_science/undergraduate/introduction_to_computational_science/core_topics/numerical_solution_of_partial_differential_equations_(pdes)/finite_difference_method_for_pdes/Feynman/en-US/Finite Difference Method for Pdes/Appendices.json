It constitutes a standard exercise in the numerical analysis of partial differential equations, specifically examining the stability and accuracy of finite difference methods for the convection-diffusion equation.\n\nThe problem investigates the one-dimensional steady linear convection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\epsilon u_{xx} - a u_x = 0\n$$\non the spatial domain $x \\in [0, 1]$, with constant positive advection speed $a > 0$ and diffusivity $\\epsilon > 0$. The equation is subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0) = 1$ and $u(1) = 0$. The analytical solution to this boundary value problem is known to be:\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{e^{ax/\\epsilon} - e^{a/\\epsilon}}{1 - e^{a/\\epsilon}}\n$$\nThis exact solution is monotonic, decreasing from $u(0)=1$ to $u(1)=0$. Any oscillations observed in a numerical solution are therefore artifacts of the discretization method.\n\nWe discretize the domain using a uniform grid of $N$ points, $x_i = i h$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where the grid spacing is $h = 1/(N-1)$. The numerical solution $u_i \\approx u(x_i)$ is sought at these grid points. The boundary conditions fix the values at the endpoints: $u_0 = 1$ and $u_{N-1} = 0$. The solution for the interior points, $u_1, \\dots, u_{N-2}$, is found by solving a system of linear equations derived from the discretized PDE.\n\nWe consider two different finite difference schemes for the spatial derivatives at an interior grid point $x_i$:\n\n1.  **Central Difference Scheme (CDS)**\n    This scheme utilizes second-order accurate central differences for both the first and second derivatives:\n    $$\n    u_x(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_{i-1}}{2h}, \\quad u_{xx}(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2}\n    $$\n    Substituting these into the governing equation $\\epsilon u_{xx} - a u_x = 0$ yields:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2} \\right) - a \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_{i-1}}{2h} \\right) = 0\n    $$\n    Multiplying by $h^2$ and collecting terms for $u_{i-1}$, $u_i$, and $u_{i+1}$, we obtain the discrete equation for each interior node $i=1, \\dots, N-2$:\n    $$\n    \\left(\\epsilon + \\frac{ah}{2}\\right) u_{i-1} - 2\\epsilon u_i + \\left(\\epsilon - \\frac{ah}{2}\\right) u_{i+1} = 0\n    $$\n    By defining the dimensionless cell Peclet number, $Pe_h = \\frac{ah}{\\epsilon}$, which compares the strength of advection to diffusion over a grid cell, the equation can be rewritten as:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{Pe_h}{2}\\right) u_{i-1} - 2 u_i + \\left(1 - \\frac{Pe_h}{2}\\right) u_{i+1} \\right) = 0\n    $$\n    A key stability criterion, related to the discrete maximum principle, requires the off-diagonal coefficients of the resulting matrix to have signs that do not cause unphysical extrema. For this equation, the coefficient of $u_{i+1}$, which is $(1 - Pe_h/2)$, becomes negative if $Pe_h > 2$. This condition is known to lead to spurious oscillations in the numerical solution, particularly in regions with strong gradients.\n\n2.  **Upwind Difference Scheme (UDS)**\n    This scheme employs a first-order accurate backward difference for the advection term (since $a>0$, the \"upwind\" direction is from smaller $x$) and the same second-order central difference for the diffusion term:\n    $$\n    u_x(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{h}, \\quad u_{xx}(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2}\n    $$\n    Substituting these approximations into the governing equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2} \\right) - a \\left( \\frac{u_i - u_{i-1}}{h} \\right) = 0\n    $$\n    Multiplying by $h^2$ and collecting terms results in the discrete equation:\n    $$\n    (\\epsilon + ah) u_{i-1} - (2\\epsilon + ah) u_i + \\epsilon u_{i+1} = 0\n    $$\n    In this formulation, the coefficients for the neighboring points $u_{i-1}$ and $u_{i+1}$ are $(\\epsilon + ah)$ and $\\epsilon$, respectively. Since $a, \\epsilon, h$ are all positive, these coefficients are always positive. The resulting matrix is diagonally dominant, and this scheme is guaranteed to produce a non-oscillatory solution for any value of the cell Peclet number, at the cost of being only first-order accurate.\n\nFor both schemes, a tridiagonal system of linear equations $M \\mathbf{u}_{\\text{int}} = \\mathbf{b}$ is formed for the vector of interior unknowns $\\mathbf{u}_{\\text{int}} = [u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-2}]^T$. The boundary conditions are incorporated into the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$. For the first interior node ($i=1$), the term involving $u_0=1$ is moved to the right side, and for the last interior node ($i=N-2$), the term involving $u_{N-1}=0$ vanishes. This results in a system where only the first element of $\\mathbf{b}$ is non-zero.\n\nThe solution is deemed oscillatory if it is not monotonically decreasing (specifically, if $u_{i+1} - u_i > \\tau$ for any $i$, where $\\tau=10^{-10}$) or if it exhibits over/undershoot beyond the physical bounds set by the boundary conditions (i.e., $\\min_i u_i < -\\tau$ or $\\max_i u_i > 1 + \\tau$).\n\nThe procedure is to solve these linear systems for each test case using both CDS and UDS, check the resulting solutions for oscillations, and assign the corresponding integer code based on the pair of outcomes. This is implemented in the provided Python code, which uses `scipy.linalg.solve_banded` for an efficient solution of the tridiagonal systems.",

The spatial domain $[0,1]$ is discretized into $N_x$ subintervals of width $\\Delta x = 1/N_x$, and the time domain $[0,T]$ is discretized into $N_t$ steps of size $\\Delta t = T/N_t$. Let $u_i^n$ be the numerical approximation of $u(x_i, t^n)$, where $x_i = i\\Delta x$ and $t^n = n\\Delta t$.\n\nThe Crank-Nicolson scheme applies a central difference in space and the trapezoidal rule in time, evaluating both at the midpoint $t^{n+1/2} = t^n + \\Delta t/2$. This results in a scheme that is second-order accurate in both space and time. The discretized equation at an interior grid point $(x_i, t^{n+1/2})$ is:\n$$ \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2u_i^{n+1} + u_{i-1}^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n} - 2u_i^{n} + u_{i-1}^{n}}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right) + f(x_i, t^{n+1/2}) $$\nApproximating the source term as $f(x_i, t^{n+1/2}) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(f_i^{n+1} + f_i^n)$, where $f_i^n = f(x_i, t^n)$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\left( D_{xx} u_i^{n+1} + D_{xx} u_i^{n} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}(f_i^{n+1} + f_i^n) $$\nwhere $D_{xx}$ represents the second-order central difference operator.\n\nTo solve for the unknown values at time $t^{n+1}$, we rearrange the equation, moving terms at step $n+1$ to the left-hand side (LHS) and terms at step $n$ to the right-hand side (RHS). Let $\\nu = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{2(\\Delta x)^2}$. The equation for each interior node $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N_x-1\\}$ becomes:\n$$ -\\nu u_{i-1}^{n+1} + (1+2\\nu)u_i^{n+1} - \\nu u_{i+1}^{n+1} = \\nu u_{i-1}^n + (1-2\\nu)u_i^n + \\nu u_{i+1}^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}(f_i^{n+1} + f_i^n) $$\n\nThis system of $N_x-1$ linear equations must be solved at each time step. Let $U^n = [u_1^n, u_2^n, \\dots, u_{N_x-1}^n]^T$ be the vector of solutions at the interior nodes at time $t^n$. The system can be written in matrix form as:\n$$ A U^{n+1} = B U^n + d^n $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are $(N_x-1) \\times (N_x-1)$ tridiagonal matrices:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+2\\nu & -\\nu & & \\\\ -\\nu & 1+2\\nu & -\\nu & \\\\ & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots \\\\ & & -\\nu & 1+2\\nu & -\\nu \\\\ & & & -\\nu & 1+2\\nu \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-2\\nu & \\nu & & \\\\ \\nu & 1-2\\nu & \\nu & \\\\ & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots \\\\ & & \\nu & 1-2\\nu & \\nu \\\\ & & & \\nu & 1-2\\nu \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe vector $d^n$ contains the discretized source terms:\n$$ d^n = \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} [f_1^{n+1}+f_1^n, \\dots, f_{N_x-1}^{n+1}+f_{N_x-1}^n]^T $$\nThe homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$ imply $u_0^n = u_{N_x}^n = 0$ for all $n$. These conditions are incorporated into the system as the terms involving $u_0$ and $u_{N_x}$ on the boundaries of the stencils for $i=1$ and $i=N_x-1$ are zero.\n\nThe numerical simulation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the solution at $t=0$ using the exact initial condition: $u_i^0 = u(x_i, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x_i)$ for $i=0, \\dots, N_x$.\n2.  For each time step $n$ from $0$ to $N_t-1$:\n    a.  Construct the RHS vector $RHS = B U^n + d^n$.\n    b.  Solve the linear system $A U^{n+1} = RHS$ for the unknown vector $U^{n+1}$.\n3.  After the final time step, the numerical solution at time $T=t^{N_t}$ is obtained.\n\nThe error is calculated using the discrete $L^2$ norm at the final time $T$:\n$$ E(N_x, N_t) = \\left( \\Delta x \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x} (u_i^{N_t} - u(x_i,T))^2 \\right)^{1/2} $$\nSince the boundary conditions are enforced exactly, the terms for $i=0$ and $i=N_x$ in the sum are zero.\n\nTo verify the order of accuracy, we assume the error follows the form $E \\approx C (\\Delta x)^{p_x} + D (\\Delta t)^{p_t}$.\n-   For the temporal order test ($p_t$), we fix $N_x$ at a large value ($N_x=300$), making the spatial error term negligible. The error is then approximated by $E \\approx D (\\Delta t)^{p_t}$. Taking the logarithm, we have $\\log(E) \\approx \\log(D) + p_t \\log(\\Delta t)$. We perform a linear least-squares fit on the points $(\\log(\\Delta t), \\log(E))$ for a sequence of $N_t$ values. The slope of the resulting line is the estimated order of convergence, $p_t$.\n-   Similarly, for the spatial order test ($p_x$), we fix $N_t$ at a large value ($N_t=1000$) to make the temporal error term negligible. Then $E \\approx C (\\Delta x)^{p_x}$, and $\\log(E) \\approx \\log(C) + p_x \\log(\\Delta x)$. We perform a linear fit on $(\\log(\\Delta x), \\log(E))$ for a sequence of $N_x$ values to find the slope $p_x$.\n\nThe provided parameters are $\\alpha=1$ and $T=0.1$. The implementation will carry out these two convergence studies, compute $p_t$ and $p_x$, and determine a pass/fail flag based on the condition that both orders are at least $1.90$.",
