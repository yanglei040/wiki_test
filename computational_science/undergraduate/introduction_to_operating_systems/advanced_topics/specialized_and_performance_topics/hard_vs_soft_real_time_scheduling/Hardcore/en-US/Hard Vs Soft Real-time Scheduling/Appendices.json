It challenges you to apply the classic utilization-based tests to determine if a set of tasks can meet its deadlines under two of the most important scheduling algorithms: Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF). By comparing these two, you will gain insight into their relative efficiency and limitations, and explore a simple method for graceful degradation in a soft real-time context .",

The solution is mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis of a real-time task set. First, we assess its schedulability under two different scheduling policies. Second, we calculate a scaling factor to make the task set schedulable under a specific condition.\n\nThe utilization $U_i$ of a single periodic task $\\tau_i$ is the ratio of its worst-case execution time $C_i$ to its period $T_i$:\n$$U_i = \\frac{C_i}{T_i}$$\nThe total utilization $U$ of the task set is the sum of the individual task utilizations:\n$$U = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} U_i$$\nThe given task set is $\\{(2,5), (1,4), (2,10)\\}$. We calculate the total utilization for the $n=3$ tasks:\n$$U = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{10}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $20$:\n$$U = \\frac{2 \\times 4}{20} + \\frac{1 \\times 5}{20} + \\frac{2 \\times 2}{20} = \\frac{8+5+4}{20} = \\frac{17}{20}$$\nAs a decimal, the total utilization is $U = 0.85$.\n\nNow we assess schedulability.\n\n**Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) Analysis:**\nRMS is a fixed-priority preemptive scheduling algorithm where tasks with shorter periods are assigned higher priorities. A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for the schedulability of $n$ independent periodic tasks with $D_i = T_i$ is the Liu and Layland utilization bound:\n$$U \\le n\\left(2^{1/n} - 1\\right)$$\nFor $n=3$ tasks, the bound is:\n$$U_{RMS\\_bound} = 3\\left(2^{1/3} - 1\\right)$$\nNumerically, this value is approximately:\n$$U_{RMS\\_bound} \\approx 3\\left(1.259921 - 1\\right) = 3\\left(0.259921\\right) \\approx 0.77976$$\nWe compare the total utilization $U$ to this bound:\n$$0.85 > 0.77976$$\nThis inequality is false. Since the total utilization $U = 0.85$ exceeds the sufficient bound for RMS, we cannot guarantee the schedulability of this task set using this test.\n\n**Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Analysis:**\nEDF is a dynamic-priority preemptive scheduling algorithm where the ready task with the earliest absolute deadline has the highest priority. For a set of independent periodic tasks on a uniprocessor with $D_i=T_i$, the necessary and sufficient condition for schedulability is:\n$$U \\le 1$$\nWe compare the total utilization $U$ to this bound:\n$$0.85 \\le 1$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the task set is schedulable under EDF.\n\n**Calculation of the Scaling Factor $\\alpha$:**\nThe second part of the problem involves scaling the worst-case execution time of each task, $C_i$, by a common factor $\\alpha$, where $0  \\alpha \\le 1$. The new execution times are $C'_i = \\alpha C_i$.\n\nThe new total utilization, denoted as $U'$, is:\n$$U' = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{C'_i}{T_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\alpha C_i}{T_i} = \\alpha \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{C_i}{T_i}\\right) = \\alpha U$$\nWe are asked to find the minimal $\\alpha$ that makes the task set meet the RMS utilization-sufficient bound exactly. This means we set the new utilization $U'$ equal to the RMS bound:\n$$U' = n\\left(2^{1/n} - 1\\right)$$\nSubstituting $U' = \\alpha U$ and the values for $n$ and $U$:\n$$\\alpha \\left(\\frac{17}{20}\\right) = 3\\left(2^{1/3} - 1\\right)$$\nNow, we solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{20}{17} \\left(3\\left(2^{1/3} - 1\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{60}{17}\\left(2^{1/3} - 1\\right)$$\nTo find the numerical value, we use the previously calculated value for the RMS bound:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{20}{17} \\times U_{RMS\\_bound} \\approx \\frac{20}{17} \\times 0.779763$$\n$$\\alpha \\approx 1.17647 \\times 0.779763 \\approx 0.917368$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.9174$$\nThis value of $\\alpha$ is the minimum scaling factor that reduces the execution times just enough for the task set's total utilization to be exactly equal to the RMS schedulability bound for $n=3$ tasks.",

            "introduction": "Real-world systems are not always as predictable as our models suggest, and a common challenge is underestimating a task's worst-case execution time ($WCET$). This exercise simulates such a scenario, moving beyond simple utilization tests to the more precise Response-Time Analysis ($RTA$) to diagnose a deadline miss for a hard real-time task. You will then design a practical soft real-time fallback mechanism, calculating a \"quality factor\" to scale down less critical tasks and ensure the hard deadline is met .",

            "problem": "A single-core, preemptive embedded controller runs three independent periodic tasks under Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS). The tasks are modeled using the standard periodic task model with period $T_i$, relative deadline $D_i$, and Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) $C_i$. All tasks have deadlines equal to periods, that is, $D_i = T_i$, zero release jitter, and negligible context-switch overhead. The tasks are:\n\n- A soft sensor-processing task $\\tau_1$ with estimated WCET $C_1^{\\text{est}} = 6 \\text{ ms}$ and period $T_1 = 10 \\text{ ms}$.\n- A hard control task $\\tau_2$ with estimated WCET $C_2^{\\text{est}} = 7 \\text{ ms}$ and period $T_2 = 25 \\text{ ms}$.\n- A soft logging task $\\tau_3$ with estimated WCET $C_3^{\\text{est}} = 10 \\text{ ms}$ and period $T_3 = 40 \\text{ ms}$.\n\nSuppose the WCETs were underestimated: the actual execution times are $C_i = 1.1 \\cdot C_i^{\\text{est}}$ for all tasks $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. The system uses RMS to assign fixed priorities based on task periods.\n\nUnder these conditions, the hard control task $\\tau_2$ violates its deadline. To preserve the hard deadline of $\\tau_2$, you implement a soft fallback that scales the execution times of the soft tasks $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_3$ by a dimensionless quality factor $q \\in (0,1]$, so that their actual execution times become $q \\cdot C_1$ and $q \\cdot C_3$, respectively, while the hard task $\\tau_2$ continues to execute at its actual time $C_2$. Assume that any reduction in $q$ strictly reduces the executed work of the soft tasks proportionally, without changing their periods or deadlines.\n\nUsing first principles of fixed-priority schedulability analysis, determine the maximum value of the quality factor $q$ such that the hard control task $\\tau_2$ meets its deadline $D_2$ under the fallback. Express the final $q$ as a dimensionless real number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The fundamental base consists of the definitions of the periodic task model and the well-established response-time analysis for fixed-priority preemptive scheduling. Under Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), tasks with shorter periods have higher priority. The worst-case response time $R_i$ of a task $\\tau_i$ under fixed priorities satisfies\n$$\nR_i \\;=\\; C_i \\;+\\; \\sum_{j \\in \\text{hp}(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j,\n$$\nwhere $\\text{hp}(i)$ is the set of tasks with higher priority than $\\tau_i$.\n\nFirst, we determine priorities under RMS using the given periods: $T_1 = 10 \\text{ ms}$, $T_2 = 25 \\text{ ms}$, $T_3 = 40 \\text{ ms}$. Therefore, $\\tau_1$ has the highest priority, $\\tau_2$ the second, and $\\tau_3$ the lowest.\n\nThe actual execution times based on the $10\\%$ underestimation are\n$$\nC_1 = 1.1 \\cdot 6 \\text{ ms} = 6.6 \\text{ ms}, \\quad C_2 = 1.1 \\cdot 7 \\text{ ms} = 7.7 \\text{ ms}, \\quad C_3 = 1.1 \\cdot 10 \\text{ ms} = 11 \\text{ ms}.\n$$\nUnder the soft fallback, only the soft tasks scale by the quality factor $q$, so their new execution times are:\n$$\nC_1(q) = q \\cdot C_1 = 6.6q \\text{ ms}, \\quad C_3(q) = q \\cdot C_3 = 11q \\text{ ms}.\n$$\nThe hard task's execution time $C_2$ remains $7.7 \\text{ ms}$.\n\nWe analyze the hard task $\\tau_2$. Its higher-priority set is $\\text{hp}(2) = \\{\\tau_1\\}$. Its response time $R_2(q)$ must satisfy $R_2(q) \\le D_2 = 25$ ms. The RTA equation for $\\tau_2$ is:\n$$\nR_2(q) \\;=\\; C_2 \\;+\\; \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_2(q)}{T_1} \\right\\rceil C_1(q) \\;=\\; 7.7 \\;+\\; \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_2(q)}{10} \\right\\rceil (6.6q).\n$$\n\nFirst, we verify the deadline miss when $q = 1$ (no scaling). The RTA iteration proceeds as follows:\n- $R^{(0)} = C_2 = 7.7$.\n- $R^{(1)} = 7.7 + \\lceil 7.7/10 \\rceil \\cdot 6.6 = 7.7 + 1 \\cdot 6.6 = 14.3$.\n- $R^{(2)} = 7.7 + \\lceil 14.3/10 \\rceil \\cdot 6.6 = 7.7 + 2 \\cdot 6.6 = 20.9$.\n- $R^{(3)} = 7.7 + \\lceil 20.9/10 \\rceil \\cdot 6.6 = 7.7 + 3 \\cdot 6.6 = 27.5$.\n- $R^{(4)} = 7.7 + \\lceil 27.5/10 \\rceil \\cdot 6.6 = 27.5$. The iteration converges to $R_2(1) = 27.5$ ms.\nSince $27.5 \\text{ ms} > D_2 = 25 \\text{ ms}$, the deadline is indeed missed.\n\nTo find the maximum $q$, we must find the boundary where the system becomes unschedulable. The response time $R_2(q)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $q$. However, it is a step function that jumps whenever the number of interfering jobs, $n = \\lceil R_2(q)/10 \\rceil$, increases. This occurs when $R_2(q)$ crosses a multiple of $T_1=10$.\nA deadline miss can occur right after such a jump. Let's find the maximum value of $q$ that does not lead to a deadline miss.\n\n- If there are $n=2$ interfering jobs from $\\tau_1$, the response time is given by $R_2(q) = 7.7 + 2 \\cdot (6.6q)$. This is valid as long as the response time remains in the interval $(10, 20]$.\n- The critical point is the upper boundary of this interval. We find the value of $q$ for which $R_2(q)$ is exactly $20$:\n$$ 7.7 + 2 \\cdot (6.6q) = 20 $$\n$$ 13.2q = 20 - 7.7 $$\n$$ 13.2q = 12.3 $$\n$$ q = \\frac{12.3}{13.2} \\approx 0.931818... $$\n- For any $q \\le 12.3/13.2$, the response time will be at most $20$ ms, thus satisfying the deadline $D_2=25$ ms.\n- For any $q$ just *above* $12.3/13.2$, the response time computed during the RTA iteration will cross $20$ ms. This will cause the number of interfering jobs to become $n=3$. The new response time will then converge to a value greater than $7.7 + 3 \\cdot (6.6 \\cdot 12.3/13.2) = 7.7 + 19.8 \\cdot (12.3/13.2) = 7.7 + 18.45 = 26.15$ ms, which exceeds the deadline of $25$ ms.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $q$ is precisely the value that keeps the response time at the boundary before the critical jump, which is:\n$$ q_{\\max} = \\frac{12.3}{13.2} \\approx 0.931818... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the maximum quality factor is $0.9318$.",

This is a cover-type selection that is effectively a greedy algorithm justified by an exchange argument: if an optimal solution contains a lower-utilization task while excluding a higher-utilization task, swapping them cannot reduce the cumulative utilization of the dropped set and does not increase the number of dropped tasks, so there exists an optimal solution formed by taking the largest utilizations first.
