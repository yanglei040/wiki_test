            "problem": "You are given a uniprocessor of unit speed (it executes at most $1$ unit of work per unit time) and a finite set of independent, preemptible jobs with no release jitter and no execution-time variation. All time quantities in this problem are in milliseconds. The jobs are released synchronously at time $t=0$ and have the following parameters, where each job $J_i$ has release time $r_i$, worst-case execution time $e_i$, and absolute deadline $d_i$:\n- $J_1: r_1=0, e_1=1, d_1=1$\n- $J_2: r_2=0, e_2=1, d_2=2$\n- $J_3: r_3=0, e_3=1, d_3=3$\n- $J_4: r_4=0, e_4=1, d_4=4$\n- $J_5: r_5=0, e_5=1, d_5=5$\n- $J_6: r_6=0, e_6=1, d_6=6$\n\nUsing only the fundamental definition of earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling, which always selects at any instant the pending job with the smallest absolute deadline, do the following:\n1) Construct the exact preemptive schedule on the interval $[0,6]$ and argue from first principles why each job $J_i$ finishes exactly at time $t=d_i$.\n2) Define the laxity (also called slack time) of a job $J$ at time $t$ as $\\ell_J(t)=d_J - t - e_J^{\\mathrm{rem}}(t)$, where $e_J^{\\mathrm{rem}}(t)$ is the remaining execution of $J$ at time $t$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of a set of six independent, preemptible jobs scheduled on a uniprocessor using the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) algorithm. This analysis involves constructing the schedule, calculating the system slack function, and finding its time-averaged value.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- A single processor with unit speed, meaning it can execute at most $1$ unit of work per unit of time.\n- A set of six jobs, denoted $J_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n- All jobs are released synchronously at time $t=0$.\n- For each job $J_i$, the release time is $r_i=0$, the worst-case execution time is $e_i=1$, and the absolute deadline is $d_i=i$. All time quantities are in milliseconds.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n1) Construction of the EDF Schedule\n\nThe earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling policy dictates that at any point in time, the processor is assigned to the available job with the nearest absolute deadline. We construct the schedule by applying this rule at each scheduling event (job release or completion).\n\n- At time $t=0$: All six jobs, $J_1, J_2, J_3, J_4, J_5, J_6$, are released and become ready for execution. Their absolute deadlines are $d_1=1, d_2=2, d_3=3, d_4=4, d_5=5, d_6=6$, respectively. According to EDF, the job with the earliest deadline, $J_1$ (with $d_1=1$), is selected to run.\n\n- During the interval $t \\in [0, 1)$: Job $J_1$ executes. Since its execution time is $e_1=1$, it runs continuously for $1$ unit of time.\n\n- At time $t=1$: Job $J_1$ completes its execution. Its finish time is $f_1=1$, which is exactly its deadline, $d_1=1$. At this moment, the set of ready jobs consists of $\\{J_2, J_3, J_4, J_5, J_6\\}$ with deadlines $\\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The EDF scheduler selects the job with the new earliest deadline, which is $J_2$ (with $d_2=2$).\n\n- During the interval $t \\in [1, 2)$: Job $J_2$ executes. Its execution time is $e_2=1$, so it runs for the entire interval.\n\n- At time $t=2$: Job $J_2$ completes. Its finish time is $f_2=2$, which equals its deadline $d_2=2$. The set of ready jobs becomes $\\{J_3, J_4, J_5, J_6\\}$. EDF selects $J_3$ (with $d_3=3$).\n\nThis pattern continues. We can state the argument from first principles for any integer $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. At time $t=k-1$, jobs $J_1, \\dots, J_{k-1}$ have completed. The set of ready jobs is $\\{J_k, J_{k+1}, \\dots, J_6\\}$. The job with the earliest deadline in this set is $J_k$, with deadline $d_k=k$. Therefore, EDF selects $J_k$ to execute. Job $J_k$ has an execution time of $e_k=1$, so it runs continuously in the interval $[k-1, k]$. At time $t=k$, job $J_k$ completes. Its finish time is $f_k=k$.\n\nTherefore, for every job $J_i$ in the set, its execution interval is $[i-1, i]$, and its finish time is $f_i=i$, which is precisely its deadline $d_i$. The processor is continuously busy from $t=0$ to $t=6$.\n\n2) System Slack Function $S(t)$\n\nThe laxity of a job $J$ at time $t$ is defined as $\\ell_J(t)=d_J - t - e_J^{\\mathrm{rem}}(t)$, where $e_J^{\\mathrm{rem}}(t)$ is the remaining execution time of $J$ at time $t$. The system slack function $S(t)$ is the minimum laxity among all jobs that have been released but have not yet completed.\n\nLet's compute $S(t)$ for $t \\in [0,6]$. We analyze the schedule interval by interval. Consider a general interval $t \\in [k-1, k)$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n- In the interval $[k-1, k)$, the set of active jobs (released and not yet completed) is $\\{J_k, J_{k+1}, \\dots, J_6\\}$.\n- The job currently executing is $J_k$. Its execution started at time $k-1$. At time $t$, it has executed for a duration of $t-(k-1)$. Its remaining execution time is $e_{J_k}^{\\mathrm{rem}}(t) = e_k - (t-(k-1)) = 1 - (t-k+1) = k-t$.\n- The laxity of the executing job $J_k$ is:\n$$ \\ell_{J_k}(t) = d_k - t - e_{J_k}^{\\mathrm{rem}}(t) = k - t - (k-t) = 0 $$\n- The other active jobs, $J_i$ for $i > k$, are preempted (waiting). They have not executed at all (in this specific schedule). Their remaining execution time is $e_{J_i}^{\\mathrm{rem}}(t) = e_i = 1$.\n- The laxity of a preempted job $J_i$ (where $i > k$) is:\n$$ \\ell_{J_i}(t) = d_i - t - e_{J_i}^{\\mathrm{rem}}(t) = i - t - 1 = (i-1) - t $$\nSince $i > k$, we have $i \\ge k+1$, which implies $i-1 \\ge k$. For $t \\in [k-1, k)$, we have $t < k$. Therefore, $t < k \\le i-1$. This means $(i-1) - t > 0$.\nSo, for any $t \\in [k-1, k)$, the laxity of the executing job $J_k$ is $0$, and the laxity of any other active job $J_i$ is strictly positive.\n\nThe system slack $S(t)$ is the minimum of all these laxities:\n$$ S(t) = \\min(\\ell_{J_k}(t), \\ell_{J_{k+1}}(t), \\dots, \\ell_{J_6}(t)) = \\min(0, \\ell_{J_{k+1}}(t), \\dots, \\ell_{J_6}(t)) = 0 $$\nThis holds for any interval $[k-1, k)$, and thus for all $t \\in [0, 6)$.\n\nWe must also check the integer time points $t=k$. At $t=k$ (for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 5\\}$), job $J_k$ has just completed (for $k \\ge 1$), and the set of active jobs for the purpose of the next scheduling decision is $\\{J_{k+1}, \\dots, J_6\\}$. The remaining execution time for any of these jobs is $e_{J_i}^{\\mathrm{rem}}(k)=1$. The laxity of such a job $J_i$ is $\\ell_{J_i}(k) = d_i - k - 1 = i - k - 1$. The system slack is the minimum of these:\n$$ S(k) = \\min_{i=k+1,\\dots,6}\\{i-k-1\\} $$\nThis minimum occurs at $i=k+1$, giving $S(k) = (k+1) - k - 1 = 0$.\n\nThus, $S(t)=0$ for all $t \\in [0, 6)$. At $t=6$, all jobs are complete, so the set of active jobs is empty. While the minimum over an empty set could be defined as $\\infty$, for the purpose of the integral over $[0,6]$, the value at a single point does not affect the result. Therefore, we can state that the system slack function is $S(t)=0$ for all $t \\in [0,6]$.\n\nThe relationship between system slack and per-job laxities is clear: for this specific job set, the system is fully utilized. The EDF scheduler always selects the job that is most urgent, and in this case, that job has a laxity of exactly $0$. This means it has precisely the amount of time needed to finish by its deadline, with no slack to spare. Because one job always has a laxity of $0$ and no job can have negative laxity (as all deadlines are met), the minimum laxity, $S(t)$, is always $0$.\n\nFinal Calculation: Time-Averaged System Slack\n\nThe final task is to compute the time-averaged system slack over the interval $[0,6]$:\n$$ \\overline{S}=\\frac{1}{6}\\int_{0}^{6} S(t)\\,dt $$\nAs established, $S(t) = 0$ for $t \\in [0,6]$. The integral is therefore:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{6} S(t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{6} 0\\,dt = 0 $$\nSubstituting this result into the formula for the average gives:\n$$ \\overline{S} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 0 = 0 $$\nThe time-averaged system slack is $0$ milliseconds.",

Each task $\\tau_i$ has worst-case execution time $C_i$, period $T_i$, and relative deadline $D_i \\leq T_i$. There is a single shared non-preemptive critical section that can cause at most one blocking per busy interval of length $B$ that is uniform across the tasks.

            "solution": "The validity and feasibility of the task set are determined using processor demand analysis (PDA) for earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling. The problem requires an exact analysis based on core definitions, which this method provides.\n\nA set of real-time tasks is schedulable under EDF if and only if, for all time intervals, the total processor demand does not exceed the length of the interval. For a set of $n$ independent, periodic tasks $\\tau_1, \\dots, \\tau_n$ with worst-case execution times $C_i$, periods $T_i$, and relative deadlines $D_i$, the processor demand $h(L)$ in an interval of length $L$ starting from a critical instant (when all tasks are released simultaneously) is the sum of the execution demands of all jobs that must complete within that interval. The demand from a single task $\\tau_i$ is given by its demand bound function:\n$$ h_i(L) = \\max\\left(0, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L - D_i}{T_i} \\right\\rfloor + 1\\right) C_i $$\nThe total demand for the task set is $h(L) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_i(L)$.\n\nThe problem introduces a single shared non-preemptive critical section, which can cause a blocking time of at most $B$. In the worst-case scenario, a high-priority job (one with an early deadline) becomes ready to execute just as a low-priority job (one with a late deadline) enters a non-preemptive section of duration $B$. This blocking time adds to the total processor demand. The feasibility condition for the system, including blocking, is therefore:\n$$ \\forall L > 0, \\quad B + h(L) \\leq L $$\nThis inequality can be rewritten to solve for the maximum allowable blocking time $B$:\n$$ B \\leq L - h(L) $$\nTo ensure feasibility for all time, $B$ must be less than or equal to the minimum value of the \"slack\" $S(L) = L - h(L)$ over all possible intervals $L > 0$. Therefore, the maximum uniform blocking time $B_{\\max}$ is:\n$$ B_{\\max} = \\min_{L > 0} \\left( L - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\max\\left(0, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L-D_i}{T_i} \\right\\rfloor + 1\\right) C_i \\right) $$\nThe demand function $h(L)$ is a step function that only increases at points where $L$ is equal to a job deadline, i.e., $L = k T_i + D_i$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$. Consequently, we only need to check the feasibility condition at these specific points up to a suitable upper bound, such as the hyperperiod of the tasks, $H = \\text{lcm}(T_1, T_2)$.\n\nThe given task parameters are:\n- Task $\\tau_1$: $C_1 = 5$ ms, $T_1 = 20$ ms, $D_1 = 5.1$ ms.\n- Task $\\tau_2$: $C_2 = 0.05$ ms, $T_2 = 100$ ms, $D_2 = 0.051$ ms.\n\nThe hyperperiod is $H = \\text{lcm}(20, 100) = 100$ ms. The set of deadlines $\\mathcal{D}$ to check in the interval $(0, 100]$ is:\n- Deadlines of $\\tau_1$: $5.1, 25.1, 45.1, 65.1, 85.1$.\n- Deadlines of $\\tau_2$: $0.051$.\nThe complete ordered set of test points is $\\mathcal{L} = \\{0.051, 5.1, 25.1, 45.1, 65.1, 85.1\\}$.

We examine the interval $[0, 0.051]$ corresponding to the minimum slack.\nConsider a critical instant at $t=0$, where jobs $J_{1,1}$ (deadline $D_1 = 5.1$) and $J_{2,1}$ (deadline $D_2 = 0.051$) are released. Assume that at $t=0$, the processor is occupied by a lower-priority task's non-preemptive critical section, which will last for a duration of $B$.\nThe processor becomes available at time $t=B$. At this moment, EDF scheduling will select the job with the earliest deadline, which is $J_{2,1}$. This job requires $C_2 = 0.05$ ms to execute.\nThe execution of $J_{2,1}$ starts at $t=B$ and finishes at $t_{\\text{finish}} = B + C_2$.\nSubstituting our chosen value for $B$:\n$$ t_{\\text{finish}} = (0.001 + \\epsilon) + 0.05 = 0.051 + \\epsilon $$\nThe deadline for job $J_{2,1}$ is $d_{2,1} = 0.051$ ms. Since $\\epsilon > 0$, we have $t_{\\text{finish}} = 0.051 + \\epsilon > 0.051$. The job's completion time is after its deadline, so a deadline is missed. This demonstrates that for any blocking time $B$ that infinitesimally exceeds $B_{\\max} = 0.001$ ms, the task set is not feasible.\n\nThe final numerical result for $B_{\\max}$ is $0.001$ ms.

The only ready job is the preempted $\\tau_{2,1}$, which resumes execution.\n-   **t=13 to t=19**: $\\tau_{2,1}$ runs for 6 more units and completes. (Total execution time: $(10-3) + (19-13) = 7 + 6 = 13$).\n-   **t=19**: The system becomes idle. The overload is cleared. Subsequent jobs will meet their deadlines.\n\nUnder RM, the high-priority task $\\tau_1$ is completely isolated from the overrun of the low-priority task $\\tau_2$. All jobs of $\\tau_1$ meet their deadlines. There are **0** deadline misses for non-overrunning jobs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of deadline misses for non-overrunning jobs under EDF is 1, and under RM is 0. This illustrates that while EDF is optimal under nominal conditions, RM provides better predictability and isolation for high-priority tasks during overload situations.\n\nThe final answer is expressed as a row matrix in the order \"EDF then RM\".",
