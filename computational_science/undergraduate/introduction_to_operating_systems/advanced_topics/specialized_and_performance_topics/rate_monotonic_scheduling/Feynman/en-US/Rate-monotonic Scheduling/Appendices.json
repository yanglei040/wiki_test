            "problem": "Consider a single-core preemptive fixed-priority system scheduled by Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), where priorities are assigned in inverse proportion to task periods. Three independent periodic tasks, denoted by $\\tau_{1}$, $\\tau_{2}$, and $\\tau_{3}$, execute on the processor. Each task $\\tau_{i}$ has a period $T_{i}$, a relative deadline equal to its period $D_{i} = T_{i}$, and a worst-case execution time $C_{i}$. There is zero release jitter and the worst-case scenario is to be analyzed at the critical instant when all tasks release simultaneously. The system uses a single shared lock for a brief non-preemptive critical section in lower-priority activity, which can block $\\tau_{3}$ once for a duration $B$ in the worst case.\n\nThe parameters are:\n- $\\tau_{1}$: $T_{1} = 5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $C_{1} = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- $\\tau_{2}$: $T_{2} = 7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $C_{2} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- $\\tau_{3}$: $T_{3} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $C_{3} = 4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Blocking for $\\tau_{3}$: $B = 3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nStarting from first principles of fixed-priority interference under Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and the critical-instant response-time definition, compute the exact worst-case response time of $\\tau_{3}$ by manually performing fixed-point iteration of the response-time relation. At each iteration, count the maximum number of higher-priority jobs that can interfere within the current response window and update the window accordingly. Stop iterating precisely when the sequence satisfies $R^{(k+1)} = R^{(k)}$. Express the final worst-case response time as a single number in milliseconds. No rounding is required; report an exact value in $\\mathrm{ms}$.",
            "solution": "The analysis of a fixed-priority preemptive system under Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) at a critical instant determines the worst-case response time ($R_i$) for a given task $\\tau_i$. The critical instant for a task occurs when it is released simultaneously with all higher-priority tasks. The worst-case response time is the time elapsed from the task's release until its completion. This duration includes its own worst-case execution time ($C_i$), any potential blocking from lower-priority tasks ($B_i$), and the cumulative interference from all higher-priority tasks.\n\nThe general equation for the worst-case response time $R_i$ is given by the solution to the following recurrence relation, which is solved using fixed-point iteration:\n$$R_i^{(k+1)} = C_i + B_i + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i^{(k)}}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j$$\nHere, $hp(i)$ denotes the set of tasks with higher priority than $\\tau_i$.

The iteration starts with an initial estimate for the response time, typically $R_i^{(0)} = C_i$, and continues until the sequence converges, i.e., $R_i^{(k+1)} = R_i^{(k)}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the task priorities. Under RMS, priority is inversely proportional to the period $T_i$.\nThe task periods are:\n- $T_{1} = 5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- $T_{2} = 7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- $T_{3} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n\nSince $T_{1} < T_{2} < T_{3}$, the priority ordering is $\\pi_{1} > \\pi_{2} > \\pi_{3}$.\nWe are required to compute the worst-case response time of task $\\tau_{3}$, denoted as $R_{3}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires finding the smallest integer $n$ for which a set of $n$ periodic, independent tasks with implicit deadlines is schedulable under Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), yet has a total utilization $U$ strictly greater than the Liu–Layland sufficient schedulability threshold, $U_{LL}(n) = n(2^{1/n} - 1)$. We must provide a rigorous argument and use a specific task set for the case of $n=2$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the case for $n=1$. For a single task $\\tau_1$ with execution time $C_1$ and period $T_1$, the total utilization is $U = \\frac{C_1}{T_1}$. The Liu–Layland threshold for $n=1$ is $U_{LL}(1) = 1(2^{1/1} - 1) = 1(2 - 1) = 1$. A single task is schedulable on a uniprocessor if and only if its execution time does not exceed its period, i.e., $C_1 \\le T_1$. This condition is equivalent to stating that its utilization must satisfy $U = \\frac{C_1}{T_1} \\le 1$. For a schedulable system with $n=1$, it is therefore required that $U \\le U_{LL}(1)$. The condition requested by the problem, $U > U_{LL}(1)$, would imply $U>1$, which corresponds to $C_1 > T_1$. A task set with $C_1 > T_1$ is inherently unschedulable. Consequently, no schedulable task set with $n=1$ can satisfy the condition. The smallest integer $n$ must be greater than $1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the case for $n=2$ using the provided harmonic task set:\n- Task $\\tau_1$: $C_1 = 1$, $T_1 = 2$.\n- Task $\\tau_2$: $C_2 = 2$, $T_2 = 4$.\n\nThe deadlines are implicit, so $D_1 = T_1 = 2$ and $D_2 = T_2 = 4$. Since $T_1 < T_2$, RMS assigns a higher priority to $\\tau_1$ and a lower priority to $\\tau_2$.\n\nThe first step is to compute the total utilization $U$ of this task set.\n$$ U = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{C_i}{T_i} = \\frac{C_1}{T_1} + \\frac{C_2}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 $$\n\nThe second step is to prove schedulability using exact Response-Time Analysis (RTA). The worst-case response time $R_i$ of a task $\\tau_i$ is calculated and must be less than or equal to its deadline $D_i$.\n\nFor the highest-priority task, $\\tau_1$, the response time is simply its own execution time, as there is no interference from higher-priority tasks.\n$$ R_1 = C_1 = 1 $$\nThe schedulability condition is $R_1 \\le D_1$. We have $1 \\le 2$, which is true. Thus, $\\tau_1$ is schedulable.\n\nFor the lower-priority task, $\\tau_2$, the response time $R_2$ is determined by its own execution time plus the interference from all higher-priority tasks. This is found by solving the following fixed-point equation iteratively:\n$$ R_2^{(k+1)} = C_2 + \\sum_{j \\in hp(2)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_2^{(k)}}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j $$\nHere, the set of higher-priority tasks is $hp(2) = \\{\\tau_1\\}$. Substituting the values $C_1=1$, $T_1=2$, and $C_2=2$:\n$$ R_2^{(k+1)} = 2 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_2^{(k)}}{2} \\right\\rceil (1) $$\nWe start the iteration with an initial guess, $R_2^{(0)} = C_2 = 2$.\n- $k=0$: $R_2^{(1)} = 2 + \\lceil \\frac{2}{2} \\rceil = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n- $k=1$: $R_2^{(2)} = 2 + \\lceil \\frac{3}{2} \\rceil = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n- $k=2$: $R_2^{(3)} = 2 + \\lceil \\frac{4}{2} \\rceil = 2 + 2 = 4$.\nThe iteration has converged, as $R_2^{(3)} = R_2^{(2)}$. The worst-case response time for $\\tau_2$ is $R_2 = 4$.\nThe schedulability condition is $R_2 \\le D_2$. We have $4 \\le 4$, which is true. Thus, $\\tau_2$ is also schedulable.\nSince both tasks are schedulable, the entire task set is schedulable under RMS. This result is also confirmed by the known property that a harmonic task set with implicit deadlines is schedulable if and only if its total utilization $U \\le 1$. Our task set is harmonic ($T_2 = 2T_1$) and has $U=1$.\n\nThe third step is to compare the computed utilization $U$ to the Liu–Layland threshold for $n=2$.\n$$ U_{LL}(2) = 2(2^{1/2} - 1) = 2(\\sqrt{2} - 1) $$\nWe must verify if $U > U_{LL}(2)$:\n$$ 1 > 2(\\sqrt{2} - 1) $$\n$$ 1 > 2\\sqrt{2} - 2 $$\n$$ 3 > 2\\sqrt{2} $$\nSquaring both sides (which is a valid operation since both sides are positive):\n$$ 3^2 > (2\\sqrt{2})^2 $$\n$$ 9 > 4 \\times 2 $$\n$$ 9 > 8 $$\nThe inequality is true. Therefore, the total utilization $U=1$ of this schedulable task set is strictly greater than the Liu–Layland bound for $n=2$.\n\nTo summarize the argument:\n1.  We established that for $n=1$, no schedulable task set can have a utilization $U$ that exceeds the corresponding Liu–Layland bound $U_{LL}(1)=1$.\n2.  We demonstrated for $n=2$ that the given task set is schedulable (via RTA) and its total utilization $U=1$ strictly exceeds the Liu–Layland bound $U_{LL}(2) = 2(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which such a task set exists is $n=2$. The problem asks for the pair $(n, U)$ for this case. We have found $n=2$ and the corresponding total utilization is $U=1$.",

A shorter period implies a higher priority. Given the periods $T_1 = 5$, $T_2 = 7$, and $T_3 = 12$, the priority ordering is Task $1$ (highest), Task $2$ (medium), and Task $3$ (lowest).\n\nThe problem asks for the worst-case response time $R_3$ of the lowest-priority task, derived from first principles. The worst-case response time of a task $i$ occurs at a critical instant, defined as a moment in time when a job of task $i$ is released simultaneously with jobs of all higher-priority tasks. The response time $R_i$ is the sum of the task's own execution time $C_i$ and the interference from all higher-priority tasks. The total interference from a higher-priority task $j$ (where $j \\in hp(i)$) over an interval of length $t$ is the number of times task $j$ can be released in that interval, multiplied by its execution time $C_j$. This number of releases is given by $\\lceil t/T_j \\rceil$.\n\nThis leads to the following recurrence relation for the worst-case response time $R_i$:\n$$R_i = C_i + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j$$\nThis equation can be solved iteratively:\n$$R_i^{(n+1)} = C_i + \\sum_{j \\in hp(i)} \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_i^{(n)}}{T_j} \\right\\rceil C_j$$\nThe iteration starts with an initial guess, typically $R_i^{(0)} = C_i$, and continues until two consecutive values are equal ($R_i^{(n+1)} = R_i^{(n)}$), at which point the value has converged to the exact response time. If at any point $R_i^{(n+1)} > D_i$, the task is deemed unschedulable, and the iteration can be stopped.\n\nFor our specific case, we seek to find $R_3$. The set of tasks with higher priority than Task $3$ is $hp(3) = \\{1, 2\\}$. The equation for $R_3$ is:\n$$R_3 = C_3 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{T_1} \\right\\rceil C_1 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{T_2} \\right\\rceil C_2$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values (all in milliseconds):\n$$R_3 = 2 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{5} \\right\\rceil (2) + \\left\\lceil \\frac{R_3}{7} \\right\\rceil (3)$$\nWe solve this iteratively, starting with an initial value $R_3^{(0)} = C_3 = 2$:\n- **Iteration 1:** $R_3^{(1)} = 2 + \\lceil 2/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 2/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (1)(2) + (1)(3) = 7$.\n- **Iteration 2:** $R_3^{(2)} = 2 + \\lceil 7/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 7/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (2)(2) + (1)(3) = 9$.\n- **Iteration 3:** $R_3^{(3)} = 2 + \\lceil 9/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 9/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (2)(2) + (2)(3) = 12$.\n- **Iteration 4:** $R_3^{(4)} = 2 + \\lceil 12/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 12/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (3)(2) + (2)(3) = 14$.\n- **Iteration 5:** $R_3^{(5)} = 2 + \\lceil 14/5 \\rceil (2) + \\lceil 14/7 \\rceil (3) = 2 + (3)(2) + (2)(3) = 14$.\n\nSince $R_3^{(5)} = R_3^{(4)}$, the sequence has converged. The exact worst-case response time for Task $3$ is $R_3 = 14\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nTo assess schedulability, we compare the response time to the deadline. For Task $3$, the deadline is $D_3 = T_3 = 12\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Since $R_3 = 14 > D_3 = 12$, Task $3$ will miss its deadline in the worst-case scenario. Therefore, the task set is **not schedulable** under RM scheduling.\n\nFor completeness, we verify the schedulability of the higher-priority tasks:\n- For Task $1$ ($hp(1) = \\emptyset$): $R_1 = C_1 = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Since $R_1 = 2 \\le T_1 = 5$, Task $1$ is schedulable.\n- For Task $2$ ($hp(2) = \\{1\\}$): $R_2 = C_2 + \\lceil R_2/T_1 \\rceil C_1 = 3 + \\lceil R_2/5 \\rceil (2)$. The iteration yields $R_2^{(0)}=3 \\rightarrow R_2^{(1)}=5 \\rightarrow R_2^{(2)}=5$. Thus, $R_2 = 5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Since $R_2 = 5 \\le T_2 = 7$, Task $2$ is schedulable.\nDespite Tasks $1$ and $2$ being schedulable, the failure of Task $3$ renders the entire task set unschedulable under RM.\n\n**Part 2: Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling Analysis**\n\nUnder Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling, priorities are dynamic. The job with the earliest absolute deadline is always dispatched for execution. For a set of independent, preemptive, periodic tasks with implicit deadlines ($D_i = T_i$) on a uniprocessor, a necessary and sufficient condition for schedulability is that the total processor utilization $U$ must not exceed unity.\n$$U = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{C_i}{T_i} \\le 1$$\nWe compute the total utilization for the given task set:\n$$U = \\frac{C_1}{T_1} + \\frac{C_2}{T_2} + \\frac{C_3}{T_3}$$\n$$U = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{1}{6}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $5 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 210$:\n$$U = \\frac{2 \\times 42}{210} + \\frac{3 \\times 30}{210} + \\frac{1 \\times 35}{210} = \\frac{84 + 90 + 35}{210} = \\frac{209}{210}$$\nThe total processor utilization is $U = \\frac{209}{210}$. Since $209  210$, we have $U  1$. The schedulability condition is satisfied. Therefore, the task set is **schedulable** under EDF scheduling.\n\nThe problem asks for the worst-case response time $R_3$ under RM scheduling. As calculated, this value is $14\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.",
