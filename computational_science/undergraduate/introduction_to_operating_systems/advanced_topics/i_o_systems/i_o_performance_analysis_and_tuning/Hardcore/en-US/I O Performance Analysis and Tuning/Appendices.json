For a classic Hard Disk Drive (HDD), a significant component of the time it takes to access data is the rotational latency—the delay waiting for the desired data to spin under the read/write head. This exercise guides you through building a mathematical model of this latency from first principles, connecting the disk's rotational speed ($N$) to the time it takes to service a request . By predicting latency and comparing it to measured values, you will develop a concrete understanding of one of the fundamental bottlenecks in mechanical storage.",

We can proceed with the solution, which involves three tasks: deriving the latency model, applying it to predict latencies, and calculating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) against measured data.\n\nFirst, we derive the expected latency function $L(\\theta)$. The total latency is the sum of the rotational latency, $\\tau_r(\\theta)$, and the fixed host/controller overhead, $\\tau_0$.\n$$L(\\theta) = \\tau_r(\\theta) + \\tau_0$$\nThe rotational latency is the time required for the disk to rotate through the specified angular displacement $\\theta$. The disk spins at a constant rotational speed of $N$ Rotations Per Minute (RPM).

The system is modeled as an $M/M/1$ queue.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\nThe problem statement is validated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard queueing theory ($M/M/1$ model), which is a cornerstone of performance analysis in computer science and engineering. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters to compute a unique solution: the average arrival rate $\\lambda$, the average service rate $\\mu$, and the measured mean latency $W_{\\text{meas}}$. The condition for steady-state stability, $\\lambda < \\mu$, is satisfied. The provided values are physically realistic for a modern block device. The problem is objective, using precise, formal language and definitions. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\n### Step 2: Theoretical Prediction ($L_{\\text{pred}}$)\nThe I/O system is modeled as an $M/M/1$ queue with the following parameters:\n- Average arrival rate: $\\lambda = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}$ requests/second.\n- Average service rate: $\\mu = 1.2 \\times 10^{3}$ requests/second.\n\nFirst, we compute the traffic intensity, or utilization, $\\rho$, which is the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate.\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{3}}{1.2 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}\n$$\nSince $\\rho < 1$, the queue is stable and will reach a steady state, as assumed in the problem.\n\nFor an $M/M/1$ queue, which is a specific type of birth-death process, the steady-state probability of having $n$ requests in the system (including the one being serviced) is given by $P_n$:\n$$\nP_n = (1 - \\rho)\\rho^n, \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n$$\nThe predicted average number of requests in the system, $L_{\\text{pred}}$, is the expected value of the random variable $n$, representing the number of requests in the system.\n$$\nL_{\\text{pred}} = E[n] = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n P_n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n(1 - \\rho)\\rho^n = (1 - \\rho) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n\\rho^n\n$$\nThe summation is a standard arithmetico-geometric series, $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n\\rho^n = \\frac{\\rho}{(1-\\rho)^2}$.

The cache capacity is $C$ pages. The workload is modeled by the Independent Reference Model (IRM): at each reference, one of the first $W$ distinct virtual memory pages is chosen independently and uniformly at random. Warm-up effects are eliminated by discarding an initial prefix of the sequence long enough that the cache operates in steady state (assume the initial $10^{6}$ references are ignored). Measurements report the steady-state hit ratio $h_{m}(W)$ for several working set sizes $W$.

The analysis will be based on the principles of the Independent Reference Model (IRM) and the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement policy.\n\nFirst, we derive the theoretical hit ratio, $h_{t}(W)$, as a function of the working set size $W$ and the cache capacity $C$. The system operates under the IRM, where each memory reference is an independent random variable drawn uniformly from a set of $W$ distinct pages. Thus, the probability of referencing any specific page is $1/W$.\n\nThe hit ratio is the probability that a requested page is present in the cache. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be the set of pages currently in the cache, and let $N_{cache} = |\\mathcal{C}|$ be the number of pages in the cache. A reference is a hit if the requested page $p$ is in $\\mathcal{C}$. Given the uniform probability distribution of requests, the probability of a hit is the sum of the probabilities of requesting each page in the cache:\n$$ h_t(W) = P(p \\in \\mathcal{C}) = \\sum_{p_i \\in \\mathcal{C}} P(\\text{request is } p_i) = \\sum_{p_i \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\frac{1}{W} = \\frac{N_{cache}}{W} $$\nThis derivation step depends on the independence assumption of the IRM, which dictates that the choice of the next page to reference is independent of the current state of the cache $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe next step is to determine $N_{cache}$ in the steady state. The problem specifies that the cache operates in a steady state after a long warm-up period. The number of pages held in the cache depends on the relationship between the working set size $W$ and the cache capacity $C$.\n\nCase 1: $W \\le C$. The number of distinct pages in the working set is less than or equal to the cache capacity. In the steady state, we assume that all $W$ pages have been referenced at least once. Since the cache has enough capacity to hold all of them ($C \\ge W$), all $W$ pages will reside in the cache. A page, once loaded, will never be evicted because an eviction only occurs on a miss that brings a *new, distinct* page into a full cache. Here, the cache never becomes full with pages that need to be evicted to make space for another page from the working set. Therefore, the number of pages in the cache is $N_{cache} = W$.\nThe theoretical hit ratio is:\n$$\nh_t(W) = \\frac{W}{W} = 1\n$$\n\nCase 2: $W > C$. The number of distinct pages is greater than the cache capacity. In steady state, the cache will be full. Any reference to one of the $W-C$ pages not in the cache will result in a miss, and the new page will be loaded, evicting the least recently used page. The number of pages in the cache will remain constant at its capacity. Therefore, $N_{cache} = C$.\nThe theoretical hit ratio is:\n$$\nh_t(W) = \\frac{C}{W}\n$$\n\nCombining these two cases, we derive the general formula for the theoretical hit ratio under the IRM/LRU model:\n$$\nh_t(W) = \\frac{\\min(C, W)}{W}\n$$\n\nWith this formula, we can now compute the theoretical hit ratios for the given parameters. The cache capacity is $C=512$ pages. The working set sizes are $W_i \\in \\{256, 640, 1024, 2048\\}$.\n\nFor $W_1 = 256$: Since $256 \\le 512$, $h_t(256) = \\frac{\\min(512, 256)}{256} = \\frac{256}{256} = 1$.\nFor $W_2 = 640$: Since $640 > 512$, $h_t(640) = \\frac{\\min(512, 640)}{640} = \\frac{512}{640} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$.\nFor $W_3 = 1024$: Since $1024 > 512$, $h_t(1024) = \\frac{\\min(512, 1024)}{1024} = \\frac{512}{1024} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\nFor $W_4 = 2048$: Since $2048 > 512$, $h_t(2048) = \\frac{\\min(512, 2048)}{2048} = \\frac{512}{2048} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.\n\nNext, we compute the RMSE between the measured hit ratios $h_m(W_i)$ and the theoretical hit ratios $h_t(W_i)$. The formula for RMSE is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\bigl(h_{m}(W_{i}) - h_{t}(W_{i})\\bigr)^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $n=4$.
