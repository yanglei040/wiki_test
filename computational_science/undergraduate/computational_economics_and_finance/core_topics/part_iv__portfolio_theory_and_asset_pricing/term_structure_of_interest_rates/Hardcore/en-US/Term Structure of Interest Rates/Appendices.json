            "introduction": "Theoretical models help us understand the fundamental drivers of yield curve dynamics. The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model is a cornerstone one-factor model that describes the evolution of the short-term interest rate. This practice will guide you through implementing the CIR model's analytical solution for bond prices, allowing you to generate yield curves and explore how model parameters can produce realistic shapes, such as an inverted curve. This exercise builds a crucial bridge between abstract stochastic processes and observable market phenomena.",

            "problem": "You are given the following setup for the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) short-rate model under the risk-neutral measure. The short rate process is defined by the stochastic differential equation:\n$$dr_t = \\kappa(\\theta - r_t) \\, dt + \\sigma \\sqrt{r_t} \\, dW_t$$\nwhere $r_t$ is the short rate at time $t$, $\\kappa$ is the speed of mean reversion, $\\theta$ is the long-run mean level, $\\sigma$ is the volatility parameter, and $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process. Assume the process is well-defined and that the parameters are such that the model is admissible.\n\nAt time $t=0$, denote the given initial short rate by $r_0$. For any maturity $T > 0$ (in years), the time-$0$ price of a default-free zero-coupon bond maturing at $T$, denoted $P(0,T)$, is defined by the risk-neutral valuation formula\n$$\nP(0,T) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp\\left( -\\int_0^T r_s \\, ds \\right) \\right],\n$$\nand the corresponding continuously-compounded zero-coupon yield is\n$$\ny(0,T) = -\\frac{1}{T}\\ln P(0,T).\n$$\n\nYour task is to, for each parameter set in the test suite below, generate the yield curve $\\{y(0,T_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ at the specified maturities $T_i$ (in years) and determine whether the curve is inverted on this grid. An inverted yield curve on the grid $\\{T_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ means the yields are strictly decreasing with maturity on this grid, i.e., $y(0,T_{i+1}) < y(0,T_i)$ for every adjacent pair $(T_i,T_{i+1})$ in the grid.\n\nAll yields must be treated as rates per year in decimal form. Maturities are in years. The final outputs are booleans indicating whether the yield curve is inverted on the specified grid for each parameter set.\n\nTest suite:\n- Maturity grid: $\\{T_i\\}_{i=1}^5 = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0]$ (years).\n- Parameter sets $(\\kappa,\\theta,\\sigma,r_0)$:\n    1. $(1.0,\\, 0.03,\\, 0.10,\\, 0.12)$\n    2. $(0.5,\\, 0.05,\\, 0.10,\\, 0.01)$\n    3. $(1.5,\\, 0.03,\\, 0.05,\\, 0.025)$\n    4. $(0.8,\\, 0.02,\\, \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot 0.02},\\, 0.09)$\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as the parameter sets above. For example, a valid output format is $[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\text{result}_3,\\text{result}_4]$, where each $\\text{result}_j$ is either $\\text{True}$ or $\\text{False}$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement submitted for analysis is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of interest rate term structure models, specifically the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) model. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided, allowing for the computation of a unique and meaningful solution. All given parameter sets adhere to the Feller condition, $2\\kappa\\theta \\geq \\sigma^2$, ensuring the short-rate process remains non-negative.\n\nThe task is to determine whether the yield curve is inverted for several parameter sets. A yield curve is defined as inverted on a specified grid of maturities, $\\{T_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, if the yield $y(0, T)$ is a strictly decreasing function of maturity $T$ over that grid, i.e., $y(0,T_{i+1}) < y(0,T_i)$ for all adjacent pairs in the grid.\n\nThe solution begins with the analytical formula for the price of a zero-coupon bond, $P(0, T)$, under the CIR model. The model specifies the short-rate dynamics as:\n$$\ndr_t = \\kappa(\\theta - r_t) \\, dt + \\sigma \\sqrt{r_t} \\, dW_t\n$$\nFor this process, the price of a bond at time $t=0$ maturing at time $T$ is given by an affine term structure model:\n$$\nP(0, T) = A(0, T) e^{-B(0, T) r_0}\n$$\nwhere $r_0$ is the initial short rate. The functions $A(0, T)$ and $B(0, T)$ depend on the model parameters $(\\kappa, \\theta, \\sigma)$ and the time to maturity $T$.\n\nFirst, we define an auxiliary parameter, $\\gamma$, as:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\kappa^2 + 2\\sigma^2}\n$$\nThe function $B(0, T)$ is then given by:\n$$\nB(0, T) = \\frac{2(e^{\\gamma T} - 1)}{(\\gamma + \\kappa)(e^{\\gamma T} - 1) + 2\\gamma}\n$$\nAnd the function $A(0, T)$ is given by:\n$$\nA(0, T) = \\left[ \\frac{2\\gamma e^{(\\kappa + \\gamma)T/2}}{(\\gamma + \\kappa)(e^{\\gamma T} - 1) + 2\\gamma} \\right]^{\\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2}}\n$$\nThe continuously compounded yield, $y(0, T)$, is defined as:\n$$\ny(0, T) = -\\frac{1}{T} \\ln P(0, T)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(0, T)$, we obtain the formula for the yield:\n$$\ny(0, T) = -\\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\ln A(0, T) - B(0, T) r_0 \\right) = \\frac{B(0, T) r_0 - \\ln A(0, T)}{T}\n$$\nTo avoid numerical instability, especially for large $T$, it is preferable to work with the logarithm of $A(0, T)$ directly:\n$$\n\\ln A(0, T) = \\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2} \\left[ \\ln(2\\gamma) + \\frac{(\\kappa + \\gamma)T}{2} - \\ln\\left( (\\gamma + \\kappa)(e^{\\gamma T} - 1) + 2\\gamma \\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n1.  For each given parameter set $(\\kappa, \\theta, \\sigma, r_0)$:\n2.  Define the maturity grid $T_{grid} = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0]$.\n3.  Calculate the auxiliary parameter $\\gamma$.\n4.  For each maturity $T_i$ in the grid, compute the yield $y(0, T_i)$ using the formulas for $B(0, T_i)$ and $\\ln A(0, T_i)$. This generates a vector of yields corresponding to the maturity grid.\n5.  Check if this vector of yields is strictly decreasing. This is achieved by verifying the condition $y(0, T_{i+1}) < y(0, T_i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 4$.\n6.  If the condition holds for all pairs, the result for the given parameter set is `True`; otherwise, it is `False`.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic and will be implemented for each test case to produce the final output. The shape of the CIR yield curve is primarily determined by the relation between the initial rate $r_0$ and the long-run mean rate $\\theta$. If $r_0$ is substantially higher than $\\theta$, the short rate is expected to fall, typically resulting in an inverted yield curve. Conversely, if $r_0 < \\theta$, an upward-sloping curve is expected. The final check across the specified grid provides a definitive answer for the given discrete maturities.",

A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution requires implementation of several financial-mathematical functions as specified. The logical structure of the problem solving proceeds as follows.\n\n**1. Yield Curve Construction**\n\nThe foundation of the calculation is the function $z(t)$ which provides the continuously compounded zero rate for any maturity $t$. This function is constructed from the given key maturities $\\{T_j\\}_{j=1}^M$ and corresponding key rates $\\{z_j\\}_{j=1}^M$. The problem specifies a piecewise-linear function on the interval $[T_1, T_M]$ with flat extrapolation outside this range. This means:\n$$\nz(t) = \\begin{cases} \nz_1 & \\text{if } t \\le T_1 \\\\\nz_j + (t - T_j) \\frac{z_{j+1} - z_j}{T_{j+1} - T_j} & \\text{if } T_j < t \\le T_{j+1} \\text{ for } 1 \\le j < M \\\\\nz_M & \\text{if } t > T_M \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis construction is efficiently implemented using interpolation libraries, which handle the piecewise definition and boundary conditions correctly. We will define a function that takes a set of cash-flow times, the key maturities, and key rates, and returns the corresponding interpolated zero rates for each time.\n\n**2. Present Value Calculation**\n\nThe present value ($PV$) of the portfolio is the sum of the discounted values of its individual cash flows. For a set of cash flows $\\{(t_i, C_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$, the present value $P$ is given by:\n$$\nP = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i \\cdot D(t_i)\n$$\nwhere $D(t_i)$ is the discount factor for maturity $t_i$. The discount factor is determined by the zero rate $z(t_i)$ from the constructed yield curve:\n$$\nD(t_i) = \\exp(-z(t_i) \\cdot t_i)\n$$\nWe will implement a function to compute this sum. This function will be the core component for all subsequent calculations.\n\n**3. Key Rate Duration (KRD) Calculation**\n\nKey Rate Duration, $\\mathrm{KRD}_k$, measures the sensitivity of the portfolio's present value to a small change in the $k$-th key rate, $z_k$. The problem specifies a numerical approximation using a symmetric finite difference method. The formula is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{KRD}_k = -\\frac{P^{(+)}_k - P^{(-)}_k}{2 \\cdot P \\cdot \\delta}\n$$\nHere, $P$ is the baseline present value. $P^{(+)}_k$ is the PV re-calculated after bumping the $k$-th key rate up by a small amount $\\delta$, i.e., using the rate vector $\\{z_1, \\dots, z_k + \\delta, \\dots, z_M\\}$. Similarly, $P^{(-)}_k$ is the PV re-calculated after bumping the $k$-th key rate down by $\\delta$, i.e., using $\\{z_1, \\dots, z_k - \\delta, \\dots, z_M\\}$.

We can construct portfolios that are \"immunized\" against small, parallel interest rate shifts by targeting zero duration, while simultaneously maximizing convexity to profit from larger rate movements. This exercise challenges you to frame a sophisticated financial strategy as a constrained optimization problem, a core skill in computational finance, by implementing an algorithm to build a duration-neutral portfolio with maximum convexity.",

            "problem": "Design and implement a complete program that, given a discrete term structure of interest rates and a finite set of zero-coupon bonds, constructs a static portfolio of these bonds that has zero dollar duration with respect to a parallel shift in the continuously compounded yield curve, and that maximizes dollar convexity per unit price under box constraints on portfolio weights.\n\nStart from the following foundational definitions in fixed-income analytics:\n- The price $P(T)$ of a zero-coupon bond with maturity $T$ years under a continuously compounded spot rate $r(T)$ is $P(T) = \\exp(-r(T)\\,T)$.\n- Under a parallel shift $y$ (in decimal units) applied to all continuously compounded rates, the perturbed price is $P_y(T) = \\exp(-(r(T)+y)\\,T)$. For a portfolio with weights $w_i$ (one weight per bond), maturities $T_i$, and spot rates $r(T_i)$, the portfolio price under shift $y$ is $P_{\\text{port}}(y) = \\sum_i w_i\\, \\exp(-(r(T_i)+y)\\,T_i)$.\n- Define portfolio dollar duration as $-\\left.\\dfrac{dP_{\\text{port}}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0}$ and portfolio dollar convexity as $\\left.\\dfrac{d^2 P_{\\text{port}}}{dy^2}\\right|_{y=0}$.\n\nYour algorithm must:\n- Use the above definitions to derive expressions for the dollar duration and dollar convexity contributions of each zero-coupon bond in terms of its maturity $T_i$ and undiscounted price $P_i = \\exp(-r(T_i)\\,T_i)$.\n- Impose the following constraints on the portfolio weights $w_i$:\n  1) A unit-price budget constraint: $\\sum_i w_i\\,P_i = 1$ (i.e., the portfolio has unit price in currency units).\n  2) Zero dollar duration: $-\\left.\\dfrac{dP_{\\text{port}}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = 0$.\n  3) Box constraints: $w_{\\min} \\le w_i \\le w_{\\max}$ for all $i$.\n- Maximize the dollar convexity per unit price. Under the unit-price budget constraint, this coincides with maximizing the portfolio’s dollar convexity itself. The objective must be expressed in terms of $w_i$, $T_i$, and $P_i$ derived from first principles as above.\n- Solve this problem as an optimization subject to linear equality constraints and bound constraints. All interest rates must be interpreted as decimals (not percentages). Time must be in years. The final optimized convexity must be reported in units of years squared.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Input is hard-coded via a test suite described below; no external input is read.\n- For each test case, compute the optimal convexity value as a float in years squared. Round each result to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case, the input is a triple: a list of maturities $[T_1,\\dots,T_n]$ in years, a list of continuously compounded spot rates $[r(T_1),\\dots,r(T_n)]$ in decimals, and uniform bounds $(w_{\\min}, w_{\\max})$ applied to all $w_i$.\n\n- Test case 1 (happy path):\n  - $T = [1.0, 3.0, 10.0]$\n  - $r = [0.02, 0.025, 0.03]$\n  - $(w_{\\min}, w_{\\max}) = (-2.0, 2.0)$\n\n- Test case 2 (multiple degrees of freedom, moderate bounds):\n  - $T = [0.5, 2.0, 5.0, 20.0]$\n  - $r = [0.015, 0.02, 0.028, 0.035]$\n  - $(w_{\\min}, w_{\\max}) = (-2.0, 2.0)$\n\n- Test case 3 (flat curve edge case):\n  - $T = [1.0, 2.0, 4.0]$\n  - $r = [0.02, 0.02, 0.02]$\n  - $(w_{\\min}, w_{\\max}) = (-2.0, 2.0)$\n\n- Test case 4 (short and long maturities mix):\n  - $T = [0.25, 7.0, 15.0]$\n  - $r = [0.01, 0.03, 0.035]$\n  - $(w_{\\min}, w_{\\max}) = (-2.0, 2.0)$\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For the four test cases above, the output must be of the form \"[c1,c2,c3,c4]\" where each $c_k$ is the optimized convexity in years squared, rounded to six decimal places, with no additional text.",
            "solution": "The problem statement shall first be subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe givens are extracted verbatim from the problem description:\n\n- **Definitions:**\n  - Zero-coupon bond price: $P(T) = \\exp(-r(T)\\,T)$ for maturity $T$ and spot rate $r(T)$.\n  - Perturbed price under parallel shift $y$: $P_y(T) = \\exp(-(r(T)+y)\\,T)$.\n  - Portfolio price under shift $y$: $P_{\\text{port}}(y) = \\sum_i w_i\\, \\exp(-(r(T_i)+y)\\,T_i)$.\n  - Portfolio dollar duration: $D_\\$ = -\\left.\\dfrac{dP_{\\text{port}}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0}$.\n  - Portfolio dollar convexity: $C_\\$ = \\left.\\dfrac{d^2 P_{\\text{port}}}{dy^2}\\right|_{y=0}$.\n\n- **Objective:**\n  - Maximize the dollar convexity per unit price.\n\n- **Constraints:**\n  1.

The definitions provided for bond pricing, dollar duration, and dollar convexity are standard Taylor series-based approximations used in interest rate risk management. The overall task of constructing a portfolio to meet specific risk (duration) and performance (convexity) targets is a canonical problem in financial engineering, often referred to as portfolio immunization or hedging. The formulation is mathematically and financially sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is a constrained optimization task. As will be shown, it reduces to a Linear Program (LP). An LP with a non-empty feasible region (the set of weights $\\mathbf{w}$ satisfying all constraints) is guaranteed to have a solution. Given the constraints, a feasible region is not guaranteed but is highly likely for the provided test cases. The problem is sufficiently specified to allow for a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical and financial terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidity flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n## Solution Derivation and Algorithmic Design\n\nThe task is to structure a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds to maximize convexity while being immune to first-order parallel shifts in the yield curve (i.e., having zero dollar duration). The portfolio's initial price is constrained to be one unit of currency.\n\n### Derivation of Objective and Constraint Functions\n\nWe begin by deriving the expressions for dollar duration and dollar convexity from the provided definition of the portfolio price under a parallel yield curve shift $y$:\n$$P_{\\text{port}}(y) = \\sum_{i} w_i \\exp(-(r(T_i) + y)T_i)$$\nLet $P_i = \\exp(-r(T_i)T_i)$ be the initial price of the $i$-th bond. The expression can be rewritten as:\n$$P_{\\text{port}}(y) = \\sum_{i} w_i P_i \\exp(-yT_i)$$\nThe portfolio's value is a function of the weights $w_i$ and the yield shift $y$. We now compute the required derivatives with respect to $y$, evaluated at $y=0$.\n\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\text{port}}}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left( \\sum_{i} w_i P_i \\exp(-yT_i) \\right) = \\sum_{i} w_i P_i \\frac{d}{dy}(\\exp(-yT_i)) = \\sum_{i} w_i P_i (-T_i \\exp(-yT_i))$$\nEvaluating at $y=0$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dP_{\\text{port}}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = -\\sum_{i} w_i P_i T_i$$\nThe portfolio dollar duration, $D_\\$$, is defined as the negative of this quantity:\n$$D_\\$ = -\\left.\\frac{dP_{\\text{port}}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = \\sum_{i} w_i P_i T_i$$\n\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d^2P_{\\text{port}}}{dy^2} = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left( -\\sum_{i} w_i P_i T_i \\exp(-yT_i) \\right) = -\\sum_{i} w_i P_i T_i (-T_i \\exp(-yT_i)) = \\sum_{i} w_i P_i T_i^2 \\exp(-yT_i)$$\nEvaluating at $y=0$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{d^2P_{\\text{port}}}{dy^2}\\right|_{y=0} = \\sum_{i} w_i P_i T_i^2$$\nThe portfolio dollar convexity, $C_\\$$, is defined as this second derivative:\n$$C_\\$ = \\left.\\frac{d^2P_{\\text{port}}}{dy^2}\\right|_{y=0} = \\sum_{i} w_i P_i T_i^2$$\n\n### Formulation as a Linear Programming Problem\n\nThe problem is to find the vector of weights $\\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n]^T$ that solves the following optimization problem:\n\n**Maximize:**\n$$C_\\$ = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i P_i T_i^2$$\n\n**Subject to:**\n1.  **Unit Price:** $\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i P_i = 1$\n2.  **Zero Dollar Duration:** $\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i P_i T_i = 0$\n3.  **Box Constraints:** $w_{\\min} \\le w_i \\le w_{\\max}$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$\n\nThis is a Linear Programming (LP) problem. The objective function and all constraints are linear functions of the decision variables $w_i$. We will use a standard LP solver, `scipy.optimize.linprog`, which is designed to solve minimization problems. To maximize our objective function $C_\\$$, we will minimize its negative, $-C_\\$$.\n\nThe standard form for `scipy.optimize.linprog` is:\n$\\min_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{w}$ subject to $\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{eq}}\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{b}_{\\text{eq}}$ and $\\mathbf{l} \\le \\mathbf{w} \\le \\mathbf{u}$.\n\nMatching our problem to this form:\n- **Decision variables** $\\mathbf{w}$: The vector of bond weights $[w_1, \\dots, w_n]^T$.\n- **Objective vector** $\\mathbf{c}$: To minimize $-C_\\$ = -\\sum_i w_i P_i T_i^2$, the objective vector is $\\mathbf{c} = [-P_1 T_1^2, -P_2 T_2^2, \\dots, -P_n T_n^2]^T$.\n- **Equality constraints matrix** $\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{eq}}$: This is a $2 \\times n$ matrix where each row corresponds to an equality constraint.\n  - Row 1 (Unit Price): $[P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_n]$\n  - Row 2 (Zero Duration): $[P_1 T_1, P_2 T_2, \\dots, P_n T_n]$\n- **Equality constraints vector** $\\mathbf{b}_{\\text{eq}}$: This is a vector of length $2$.\n  - $[1, 0]^T$\n- **Bounds**: The box constraints are handled directly by the `bounds` parameter, which is a sequence of $(w_{\\min}, w_{\\max})$ tuples for each $w_i$.\n\n### Algorithm for Implementation\n\nFor each given test case (a set of maturities $T_i$, spot rates $r_i$, and bounds $w_{\\min}, w_{\\max}$):\n1.  Compute the bond prices $P_i = \\exp(-r_i T_i)$ for all $i$.\n2.  Construct the objective vector $\\mathbf{c}$ for the minimization problem. For each bond $i$, the corresponding element is $-P_i T_i^2$.\n3.  Construct the $2 \\times n$ equality constraint matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{eq}}$. The first row contains the prices $P_i$, and the second row contains the dollar duration contributions per unit, $P_i T_i$.\n4.  Construct the equality constraint vector $\\mathbf{b}_{\\text{eq}} = [1, 0]^T$.\n5.  Define the bounds for each weight $w_i$ as $(w_{\\min}, w_{\\max})$.\n6.  Solve the LP problem using `scipy.optimize.linprog`. The result of the optimization, `res.fun`, will be the minimum value of the objective function, which is $-\\max(C_\\$)$.\n7.  The maximum convexity is therefore $-(\\text{res.fun})$.\n8.  Round the final convexity value to six decimal places as required.",
