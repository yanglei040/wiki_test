It describes a standard VAR(1) model, a fundamental tool in computational economics and finance. All components—stability condition, positive definite covariance matrix, Cholesky decomposition for orthogonalization, and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD)—are standard concepts in time series analysis. The condition $\\rho \\in (-1,1)$ ensures that $\\Sigma_u$ is positive definite, as its determinant is $1-\\rho^2 > 0$ and its diagonal elements are positive. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to compute the requested quantity. The language is objective and precise. The information about the matrix $A$ and its stability is necessary for a complete model definition but is not required for the specific calculation at horizon $h=1$; this does not constitute a flaw. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe $1$-step-ahead forecast of $\\mathbf{y}_{t+1}$ conditional on information at time $t$ is $E[\\mathbf{y}_{t+1} | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = A \\mathbf{y}_{t}$. The corresponding forecast error is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}_{t+1|t} = \\mathbf{y}_{t+1} - E[\\mathbf{y}_{t+1} | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = (A \\mathbf{y}_{t} + \\mathbf{u}_{t+1}) - A \\mathbf{y}_{t} = \\mathbf{u}_{t+1}\n$$\nThe covariance matrix of the $1$-step-ahead forecast error is therefore the covariance matrix of the innovations, $\\Sigma_u$.\n$$\n\\text{MSE}(1) = E[\\mathbf{e}_{t+1|t} \\mathbf{e}_{t+1|t}^{\\prime}] = E[\\mathbf{u}_{t+1} \\mathbf{u}_{t+1}^{\\prime}] = \\Sigma_u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\rho \\\\ \\rho & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe $1$-step-ahead forecast error variance for variable $y_{i,t+1}$ is the $i$-th diagonal element of $\\text{MSE}(1)$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(e_{1,t+1|t}) = (\\Sigma_u)_{11} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}(e_{2,t+1|t}) = (\\Sigma_u)_{22} = 1\n$$\nThe Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) attributes portions of this forecast error variance to a set of orthogonalized shocks, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{t}$. These are derived from the reduced-form shocks $\\mathbf{u}_{t}$ via the relation $\\mathbf{u}_{t} = P \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{t}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{t}$ has an identity covariance matrix and $P$ is the Cholesky factor of $\\Sigma_u$. Given the ordering $(y_1, y_2)$, $P$ is a lower triangular matrix.\nLet $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & 0 \\\\ p_{21} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$.

Since $\\text{Var}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{t+1})=I$, the shocks are uncorrelated and have unit variance.\n\nFor $y_{1,t+1}$, the forecast error is $e_{1,t+1|t} = \\varepsilon_{1,t+1}$. Its variance is $\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_{1,t+1}) = 1$. The contribution from shock $\\varepsilon_{1,t+1}$ is $1$, and the contribution from shock $\\varepsilon_{2,t+1}$ is $0$.\nThus, the share of variance attributable to shock $2$ is:\n$$\n\\theta_{1 \\leftarrow 2}(1) = \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n$$\n\nFor $y_{2,t+1}$, the forecast error is $e_{2,t+1|t} = \\rho\\varepsilon_{1,t+1} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^{2}}\\varepsilon_{2,t+1}$. Its variance is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(e_{2,t+1|t}) = \\text{Var}(\\rho\\varepsilon_{1,t+1} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^{2}}\\varepsilon_{2,t+1}) = \\rho^{2}\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_{1,t+1}) + (1-\\rho^{2})\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_{2,t+1}) = \\rho^{2}(1) + (1-\\rho^{2})(1) = 1\n$$\nThe component of the variance attributable to shock $\\varepsilon_{1,t+1}$ is $\\rho^{2}\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_{1,t+1}) = \\rho^{2}$.\nThe share of the variance attributable to shock $1$ is:\n$$\n\\theta_{2 \\leftarrow 1}(1) = \\frac{\\rho^{2}}{\\text{Var}(e_{2,t+1|t})} = \\frac{\\rho^{2}}{1} = \\rho^{2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference $\\Delta(\\rho)$:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\rho) = \\theta_{1 \\leftarrow 2}(1) - \\theta_{2 \\leftarrow 1}(1) = 0 - \\rho^{2} = -\\rho^{2}\n$$\nThe result depends only on the contemporaneous correlation $\\rho$ and the chosen ordering for the Cholesky decomposition, and is independent of the system dynamics matrix $A$.",

This implies a system of $n$ completely uncoupled AR(1) processes. All concepts, such as the VAR representation, stability conditions, Cholesky decomposition, and FEVD, are standard in time series econometrics. The problem is self-contained, mathematically consistent, and scientifically grounded. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles. The setup is well-posed and allows for a unique, deterministic solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe $VAR(1)$ model is given by $Y_t = \\Phi Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t$.\nBy recursive substitution, we can express $Y_{t+h}$ in its moving average (MA) representation.\n$Y_{t+h} = \\Phi Y_{t+h-1} + \\epsilon_{t+h} = \\Phi(\\Phi Y_{t+h-2} + \\epsilon_{t+h-1}) + \\epsilon_{t+h} = \\dots$\nThe general form is $Y_{t+h} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\Psi_k \\epsilon_{t+h-k}$, where the impulse response function matrices are given by $\\Psi_k = \\Phi^k$.\n\nThe $h$-step ahead forecast of $Y_{t+h}$ made at time $t$ is $\\mathbb{E}_t[Y_{t+h}]$.\n$\\mathbb{E}_t[Y_{t+h}] = \\mathbb{E}_t\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} \\Psi_k \\epsilon_{t+h-k} + \\sum_{k=h}^{\\infty} \\Psi_k \\epsilon_{t+h-k}\\right]$.\nSince $\\mathbb{E}_t[\\epsilon_{t+s}] = 0$ for $s > 0$, the first summation has an expectation of zero. The second summation depends on information available at or before time $t$.\nThus, the $h$-step ahead forecast error is $e_t(h) = Y_{t+h} - \\mathbb{E}_t[Y_{t+h}] = \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} \\Psi_k \\epsilon_{t+h-k}$.\n\nThe covariance matrix of the forecast error, or the Mean Squared Error (MSE) matrix, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{MSE}(h) = \\mathbb{E}[e_t(h) e_t(h)'] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} \\Psi_k \\epsilon_{t+h-k}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \\Psi_j \\epsilon_{t+h-j}\\right)'\\right] $$\nSince the innovations $\\epsilon_t$ are serially uncorrelated, $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{t+h-k}\\epsilon_{t+h-j}'] = 0$ for $k \\neq j$. This simplifies the expression to:\n$$ \\mathrm{MSE}(h) = \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} \\Psi_k \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{t+h-k}\\epsilon_{t+h-k}'] \\Psi_k' = \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} \\Psi_k \\Sigma_\\epsilon \\Psi_k' $$\nThe total $h$-step forecast error variance of the $i$-th variable, $Y_{i,t}$, is the $i$-th diagonal element of this matrix, $(\\mathrm{MSE}(h))_{ii}$.\n\nThe FEVD is based on orthogonalized innovations. Let $\\Sigma_\\epsilon = PP'$ be the Cholesky decomposition of the innovation covariance matrix. The orthogonalized innovations are $u_t = P^{-1}\\epsilon_t$, such that $\\mathbb{E}[u_t u_t'] = I$. We can write $\\epsilon_t = P u_t$.\nThe forecast error becomes $e_t(h) = \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} (\\Psi_k P) u_{t+h-k}$. Let $A_k = \\Psi_k P$.\nThe portion of the forecast error variance of variable $i$ attributable to shocks in variable $j$ (specifically, the $j$-th orthogonal shock $u_{j,t}$) is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,j}]^2$, where $(A_k)_{i,j}$ is the $(i,j)$-th element of the matrix $A_k$.\nThe FEVD share $\\theta_{ij}(h)$ is the ratio of this contribution to the total forecast error variance of variable $i$:\n$$ \\theta_{ij}(h) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,j}]^2}{\\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,l}]^2} $$\nLet us analyze the structure of the matrices in this specific problem.\n1.  The dynamics matrix $\\Phi = \\mathrm{diag}(\\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_n)$ is diagonal.\n2.  The impulse response matrices are $\\Psi_k = \\Phi^k = \\mathrm{diag}(\\phi_1^k, \\dots, \\phi_n^k)$, which are also diagonal for all $k \\ge 0$.\n3.  The innovation covariance matrix $\\Sigma_\\epsilon = \\mathrm{diag}(\\sigma_1^2, \\dots, \\sigma_n^2)$ is diagonal.\n4.  The Cholesky factor $P$ of a positive-definite diagonal matrix is also a diagonal matrix. Specifically, $P = \\mathrm{diag}(\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_n)$, where $\\sigma_i = \\sqrt{\\sigma_i^2} > 0$.\n5.  The orthogonalized impulse response matrices are $A_k = \\Psi_k P$. Since $\\Psi_k$ and $P$ are both diagonal matrices, their product $A_k$ must also be a diagonal matrix.\n    $$ A_k = \\mathrm{diag}(\\phi_1^k, \\dots, \\phi_n^k) \\mathrm{diag}(\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_n) = \\mathrm{diag}(\\phi_1^k\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\phi_n^k\\sigma_n) $$\nThis is the critical result. For any $k$, the matrix $A_k$ is diagonal. This means its off-diagonal elements are zero: $(A_k)_{ij} = 0$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n\nNow we calculate the FEVD shares $\\theta_{ij}(h)$.\nCase 1: $i \\neq j$.\nThe numerator of the expression for $\\theta_{ij}(h)$ is $\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,j}]^2$. Since $(A_k)_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$, this sum is $\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} 0^2 = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\theta_{ij}(h) = 0$ for all $i \\neq j$ and for any horizon $h \\ge 1$.\n\nCase 2: $i = j$.\nThe share $\\theta_{ii}(h)$ is:\n$$ \\theta_{ii}(h) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,i}]^2}{\\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,l}]^2} $$\nThe denominator is the total $h$-step forecast error variance for variable $i$. Let's expand it:\n$$ \\sum_{l=1}^{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,l}]^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,1}]^2 + \\dots + \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,i}]^2 + \\dots + \\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,n}]^2 $$\nSince $(A_k)_{il} = 0$ for $l \\neq i$, all terms in the sum over $l$ vanish except for the term where $l=i$.\nThus, the denominator simplifies to $\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,i}]^2$.\nThe numerator and the denominator are identical.\n$$ \\theta_{ii}(h) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,i}]^2}{\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} [(A_k)_{i,i}]^2} = 1 $$\nThis is valid as long as the denominator is not zero. The denominator is $\\sum_{k=0}^{h-1} (\\phi_i^k \\sigma_i)^2$. For $h \\ge 1$, the $k=0$ term is $(\\phi_i^0 \\sigma_i)^2 = \\sigma_i^2$. Since innovations have positive variance ($\\sigma_i^2 > 0$), the denominator is strictly positive.\n\nConclusion: For any horizon $h \\ge 1$, we have $\\theta_{ij}(h) = 1$ if $i=j$ and $\\theta_{ij}(h) = 0$ if $i \\neq j$. This means the FEVD matrix is the identity matrix $I_n$ for all $h$. This is intuitive: the system is a collection of uncoupled processes, so a shock to one variable can never affect another.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For all $h \\ge 1$, $\\theta_{ij}(h) = 1$ if $i = j$ and $\\theta_{ij}(h) = 0$ if $i \\neq j$ (equivalently, the FEVD matrix equals the $n \\times n$ identity matrix for every $h$).**\nThis statement matches the result of our derivation precisely. Due to the diagonal structure of both $\\Phi$ and $\\Sigma_\\epsilon$, there are no cross-variable effects, neither dynamically nor contemporaneously.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The FEVD shares depend on $\\{\\phi_i\\}$ and $\\{\\sigma_i^2\\}$ such that, whenever $\\lvert \\phi_j \\rvert > 0$, a strictly positive fraction of the $h$-step ahead forecast error variance of $Y_{i,t}$ is attributable to the innovation in $Y_{j,t}$ for some $i \\neq j$.**\nThis is incorrect. Our derivation shows that for any $i \\neq j$, the share $\\theta_{ij}(h)$ is always zero, regardless of the values of $\\phi_j$ or $\\sigma_j$. The system is completely decoupled. A non-zero autoregressive coefficient $\\phi_j$ only creates persistence for variable $Y_j$ itself; it does not create a channel for shocks to affect other variables $Y_i$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The FEVD is not well-defined without specifying a variable ordering, and different orderings lead to different FEVD shares for the same $h$ in this system.**\nThis statement is generally true for VAR models because the Cholesky decomposition is not invariant to the ordering of variables when $\\Sigma_\\epsilon$ has non-zero off-diagonal elements. However, in this special case, $\\Sigma_\\epsilon$ is a diagonal matrix. The Cholesky factor of a diagonal matrix is also diagonal, and its elements are simply the square roots of the diagonal elements of the original matrix. Permuting the order of variables only permutes the diagonal elements of $\\Sigma_\\epsilon$ and its Cholesky factor $P$. The resulting FEVD matrix is the identity matrix, which is invariant under any permutation of its rows and columns. Thus, for this specific system, the FEVD is unique and independent of the variable ordering.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. For $h = 1$, each variable’s forecast error variance is entirely due to its own innovation, but for all $h \\ge 2$ some positive FEVD shares appear across variables because lag propagation transmits shocks even though $\\Phi$ is diagonal.**\nThe first part of the statement is correct. For $h=1$, the forecast error is $\\epsilon_{t+1}$, and the FEVD simply analyzes the components of variance in the diagonal matrix $\\Sigma_\\epsilon$, leading to a diagonal FEVD matrix. The second part is fundamentally flawed. A diagonal $\\Phi$ matrix means there is no lag propagation between different variables. The equation for variable $i$, $Y_{i,t} = \\phi_i Y_{i,t-1} + \\epsilon_{i,t}$, shows that $Y_{i,t}$ depends only on its own past, not on the past of any other variable $Y_j$ where $j \\neq i$. Therefore, no cross-variable effects can appear at any lag.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem requires a quantitative comparison between the Forecast Error Variance Decompositions (FEVDs) derived from two distinct time series models for a bivariate system, $y_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The first model is the true data-generating process, a Vector Error Correction Model of order $2$, which is equivalent to a Vector Autoregression (VAR) of order $2$ in levels. The second is a misspecified VAR of order $1$ in levels, which omits the short-run dynamics term. Our objective is to calculate the maximum absolute discrepancy between the FEVD matrices produced by these two models for a given set of parameters.\n\nThe problem statement is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It provides all necessary definitions, equations, and data to proceed with a unique and verifiable solution. We will now detail the formal procedure.\n\nFirst, we must construct the coefficient matrices for both models from the given parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\Gamma_1)$. The system dimension is $k=2$.\n\nThe correctly specified model is a VECM($2$), which can be written as a VAR($2$) in levels:\n$$\ny_t \\;=\\; A_1 \\, y_{t-1} \\;+\\; A_2 \\, y_{t-2} \\;+\\; u_t\n$$\nwhere the coefficient matrices are defined as:\n$$\nA_1 \\;=\\; I_2 + \\Pi + \\Gamma_1\n$$\n$$\nA_2 \\;=\\; -\\Gamma_1\n$$\nwith $I_2$ being the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix and $\\Pi = \\alpha \\beta^{\\top}$. The innovation term $u_t$ is equal to the VECM innovation $\\varepsilon_t$.\n\nThe misspecified model is a VAR($1$) in levels, denoted by the superscript 'L':\n$$\ny_t \\;=\\; A^{\\mathrm{L}}_1 \\, y_{t-1} \\;+\\; \\tilde{u}_t\n$$\nwhere the coefficient matrix is:\n$$\nA^{\\mathrm{L}}_1 \\;=\\; I_2 + \\Pi\n$$\nThis model incorrectly assumes $\\Gamma_1 = \\mathbf{0}$, meaning no short-run dynamics. The innovation term $\\tilde{u}_t$ is assumed to be $\\varepsilon_t$.\n\nThe core of the analysis lies in the moving-average (MA) representation for each model. For a general VAR($p$) model, the MA coefficient matrices, $\\Psi_i$, are computed recursively. We need these matrices up to horizon $h-1$.\nThe recursion is given by:\n$$\n\\Psi_0 = I_2\n$$\n$$\n\\Psi_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\min\\{p,i\\}} \\Psi_{i-j} A_j, \\quad \\text{for } i \\ge 1\n$$\nFor the VAR($2$) model ($p=2$), the recursion is:\n$$\n\\Psi_i^{\\mathrm{VECM}} = \\Psi_{i-1}^{\\mathrm{VECM}} A_1 + \\Psi_{i-2}^{\\mathrm{VECM}} A_2, \\quad \\text{for } i \\ge 2\n$$\nwith initial conditions $\\Psi_0^{\\mathrm{VECM}} = I_2$ and $\\Psi_1^{\\mathrm{VECM}} = A_1$.\n\nFor the misspecified VAR($1$) model ($p=1$), the recursion simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Psi_i^{\\mathrm{L}} = \\Psi_{i-1}^{\\mathrm{L}} A^{\\mathrm{L}}_1 = (A^{\\mathrm{L}}_1)^i, \\quad \\text{for } i \\ge 1\n$$\nwith $\\Psi_0^{\\mathrm{L}} = I_2$.\n\nTo account for contemporaneous correlation in the innovations $\\varepsilon_t$, we orthogonalize the shocks using the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. We find a lower-triangular matrix $P$ such that $\\Sigma = P P^{\\top}$. The orthogonalized impulse response coefficient matrices are then:\n$$\n\\Theta_i = \\Psi_i P, \\quad \\text{for } i = 0, \\dots, h-1\n$$\nThis computation is performed separately for each model, using $\\Psi_i^{\\mathrm{VECM}}$ and $\\Psi_i^{\\mathrm{L}}$, respectively. The matrix $P$ is the same for both, as they share the same innovation covariance $\\Sigma$.\n\nThe Forecast Error Variance Decomposition, $\\mathrm{FEVD}_{m,k}(h)$, measures the proportion of the $h$-step-ahead forecast error variance of variable $m$ that is attributable to the $k$-th orthogonalized shock. For a variable $m \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ and shock $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, the FEVD at horizon $h$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FEVD}_{m,k}(h) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} \\left(\\Theta_i[m-1,k-1]\\right)^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} \\left(\\Theta_i[m-1,j-1]\\right)^2}\n$$\nNote the indices are adjusted to $0$-based for matrix implementation. For each model, these calculations yield a $2 \\times 2$ FEVD matrix.\n\nFinally, we quantify the discrepancy between the two models by computing $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\;=\\; \\max_{m \\in \\{1,2\\}, \\, k \\in \\{1,2\\}} \\left| \\mathrm{FEVD}^{\\mathrm{L}}_{m,k}(h) \\;-\\; \\mathrm{FEVD}^{\\mathrm{VECM}}_{m,k}(h) \\right|\n$$\nThis is the maximum element-wise absolute difference between the FEVD matrix from the misspecified VAR($1$) model and the FEVD matrix from the correctly specified VECM($2$) model.\n\nFor Case B, the short-run dynamics matrix $\\Gamma_1$ is the zero matrix. This implies $A_2 = \\mathbf{0}$ and $A_1 = I_2 + \\Pi = A_1^{\\mathrm{L}}$. Consequently, the VAR($2$) model specification collapses to the VAR($1$) specification. The MA coefficients $\\Psi_i$ will be identical for both models, leading to identical FEVDs. Therefore, $\\Delta$ is theoretically expected to be $0$ for Case B, which serves as a control for our computational procedure.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is as follows:\n1. For each parameter set $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\Gamma_1, \\Sigma, h)$:\n2. Construct the VAR coefficient matrices for both the VECM($2$) and VAR($1$) models.\n3. Define a function to compute the FEVD matrix, which takes the VAR coefficient matrices, $\\Sigma$, and $h$ as input. This function will:\n    a. Iteratively compute the MA response matrices $\\Psi_i$ up to horizon $h-1$.\n    b. Compute the Cholesky factor $P$ of $\\Sigma$.\n    c. Compute the orthogonalized responses $\\Theta_i = \\Psi_i P$.\n    d. Sum the squared elements of $\\Theta_i$ over the horizon to get the numerators of the FEVD.\n    e. Normalize to obtain the final FEVD matrix.\n4. Call this function for both models to obtain $\\mathrm{FEVD}^{\\mathrm{VECM}}$ and $\\mathrm{FEVD}^{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n5. Compute $\\Delta$ as the maximum of the absolute differences between the two FEVD matrices.\n6. Store and format the results for the three cases.",
