It uses a Cobb-Douglas production function, a canonical model in economics. All concepts are well-established. This is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is a constrained optimization problem. The objective function is linear (and thus convex), and the constraint function $g(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2}$ is quasiconcave, which defines a convex upper-level set.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe firm's problem is to minimize its total cost, $C(x_1, x_2) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2$, subject to the constraint that its output, $y = f(x_1, x_2)$, is at least the quota amount $q_0$. The non-negativity of inputs, $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_2 \\ge 0$, is implicitly required by the form of the production function.\n\nSubstituting the given values, the optimization problem is:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize } C(x_1, x_2) = 4x_1 + x_2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Subject to } x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2} \\ge 10\n$$\n\nTo apply the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) framework, we write the constraint in the standard form $g(x) \\le 0$.\nThe constraint $x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2} \\ge 10$ is equivalent to $10 - x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2} \\le 0$.\n\nThe Lagrangian function, $\\mathcal{L}$, is constructed as the objective function plus the Lagrange multiplier, $\\lambda$, times the constraint function:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \\lambda) = 4x_1 + x_2 + \\lambda(10 - x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2})\n$$\n\nThe KKT conditions for an optimal solution $(x_1^*, x_2^*, \\lambda^*)$ are:\n1.

Dual feasibility: The Lagrange multiplier associated with the inequality constraint must be non-negative: $\\lambda \\ge 0$.\n4.  Complementary slackness: At the optimum, either the constraint is binding or the multiplier is zero (or both).\n    $$\n    \\lambda (10 - x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2}) = 0\n    $$\n\nWe now solve this system of conditions.\nFrom the first-order conditions, assuming $x_1 > 0$ and $x_2 > 0$:\n$$\n4 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{x_2}{x_1}} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n1 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{x_1}{x_2}} \\quad (2)\n$$\nThe right-hand sides are positive, which implies that $\\lambda$ must be strictly positive ($\\lambda > 0$). If $\\lambda$ were zero, the first-order conditions would require $4=0$ and $1=0$, which is absurd.\nSince $\\lambda > 0$, the complementary slackness condition $\\lambda (10 - x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2}) = 0$ implies that the constraint must be binding:\n$$\n10 - x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2} = 0 \\implies x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2} = 10 \\quad (3)\n$$\nNow, we can solve for the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$ by dividing equation $(1)$ by equation $(2)$:\n$$\n\\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{x_2}{x_1}}}{\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{x_1}{x_2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x_2}}{\\sqrt{x_1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{x_2}}{\\sqrt{x_1}} = \\frac{x_2}{x_1}\n$$\nThis gives the firm's optimal input expansion path: $x_2 = 4x_1$.\n\nSubstitute this relationship into the binding constraint, equation $(3)$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{x_1 (4x_1)} = 10\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{4x_1^2} = 10\n$$\n$$\n2x_1 = 10\n$$\nSolving for $x_1$ gives the optimal quantity for the first input:\n$$\nx_1^* = 5\n$$\nNow, we find the optimal quantity for the second input:\n$$\nx_2^* = 4x_1^* = 4(5) = 20\n$$\nThe optimal input bundle is $(x_1^*, x_2^*) = (5, 20)$.\n\nFinally, we solve for the Lagrange multiplier, $\\lambda^*$, using equation $(2)$ and the optimal inputs:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{\\lambda^*}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{x_1^*}{x_2^*}} = \\frac{\\lambda^*}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{20}} = \\frac{\\lambda^*}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\lambda^*}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\lambda^*}{4}\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\n\\lambda^* = 4\n$$\nThe optimal Lagrange multiplier is $\\lambda^*=4$. We confirm that $\\lambda^* \\ge 0$, satisfying the dual feasibility condition.\n\nThe economic interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda^*$ in a cost minimization context is the marginal cost of the constraint. It represents the rate at which the firm's minimum cost changes with respect to a relaxation of the production quota, $q_0$.\nThat is, $\\lambda^* = \\frac{dC^*(q_0)}{dq_0}$, where $C^*$ is the minimized cost.\n\nThe problem asks to estimate the change in the minimal total cost if the production quota increases by one unit, from $q_0 = 10$ to $q_0' = 11$. This change, $\\Delta q_0$, is $11 - 10 = 1$.\nUsing a first-order linear approximation, the change in minimum cost, $\\Delta C^*$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta C^* \\approx \\lambda^* \\cdot \\Delta q_0\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\Delta C^* \\approx 4 \\cdot 1 = 4\n$$\nThe estimated increase in the firm's minimal total cost is $4$ dollars.\nThe initial minimum cost is $C^* = 4x_1^* + x_2^* = 4(5) + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40$. The new estimated minimum cost would be $40+4=44$.",

Starting with an initial trial step $\\alpha = \\alpha_0$, we iteratively reduce it by a factor $\\tau$ until the Armijo sufficient decrease condition is satisfied:\n  $$\n  f(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha \\mathbf{p}_k) \\le f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + c_1 \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^{\\top} \\mathbf{p}_k\n  $$\n  Substituting $\\mathbf{p}_k = -\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$, the condition becomes:\n  $$\n  f(\\mathbf{x}_k - \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)) \\le f(\\mathbf{x}_k) - c_1 \\alpha \\lVert \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\rVert_2^2\n  $$\nThe algorithm proceeds by generating a sequence of iterates $\\{\\mathbf{x}_k\\}$ until $\\lVert \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$. The convergence rate of gradient descent is known to degrade as the condition number $\\kappa(\\mathbf{Q})$ increases.\n\n**2. Newton's Method with Backtracking Line Search**\n- **Search Direction:** Newton's method uses a second-order approximation of the function. The Newton direction $\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}$ is found by solving the linear system:\n  $$\n  \\nabla^2 f(\\mathbf{x}_k) \\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}} = -\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\n  $$\n  For our quadratic objective, this becomes:\n  $$\n  \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}} = -(\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{x}_k - \\mathbf{b})\n  $$\n  Solving for $\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}$ yields:\n  $$\n  \\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}} = -\\mathbf{Q}^{-1}(\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{x}_k - \\mathbf{b}) = \\mathbf{Q}^{-1}\\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{x}_k = \\mathbf{x}^* - \\mathbf{x}_k\n  $$\n  The Newton direction points directly from the current iterate to the exact minimizer.\n- **Line Search:** The line search is performed as in gradient descent. Let's analyze the Armijo condition for the initial trial step $\\alpha=1$:\n  $$\n  f(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}) \\le f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + c_1 \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^{\\top} \\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}\n  $$\n  The Taylor expansion of $f(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}})$ around $\\mathbf{x}_k$ is exact up to the second order for a quadratic function:\n  $$\n  f(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}) = f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^{\\top}\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 (\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}})^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}\n  $$\n  Substituting $\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}} = -\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)$:\n  $$\n  f(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}) = f(\\mathbf{x}_k) + \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^{\\top}\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^{\\top}\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}\n  $$\n  The Armijo condition becomes:\n  $$\n  f(\\mathbfx_k) + \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbfx_k)^{\\top}\\mathbfp_k^{\\text{N}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 \\nabla f(\\mathbfx_k)^{\\top}\\mathbfp_k^{\\text{N}} \\le f(\\mathbfx_k) + c_1 \\alpha \\nabla f(\\mathbfx_k)^{\\top} \\mathbfp_k^{\\text{N}}\n  $$\n  Since $\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}$ is a descent direction, $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)^{\\top}\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}} = -(\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}})^{\\top}\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{p}_k^{\\text{N}}  0$. We can divide by this negative term, reversing the inequality:\n  $$\n  1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha \\ge c_1 \\implies \\alpha \\le 2(1-c_1)\n  $$\n  With $c_1=10^{-4}$, the condition is $\\alpha \\le 2(1 - 10^{-4}) = 1.9998$. Since the initial trial step is $\\alpha_0 = 1$, which is less than $1.9998$, the step $\\alpha_k=1$ will always be accepted.\n  The update is $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k + 1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{x}^* - \\mathbf{x}_k) = \\mathbf{x}^*$.\n  Thus, Newton's method with the specified backtracking parameters will converge to the exact solution in a single iteration for any starting point other than the optimum itself.\n\n**Implementation Summary**\nThe implementation will consist of two functions, one for each algorithm. Each function will iteratively update the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ according to its specific rule and perform backtracking line search to determine the step size. The loop terminates when the Euclidean norm of the gradient is below the tolerance $\\varepsilon$ or the maximum number of iterations is reached.\nFor Case $1$, since $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$, the initial gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_0) = \\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{0} - \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$. The stopping condition is satisfied at the start, so both algorithms will report $0$ iterations.\nFor Cases $2$, $3$, and $4$, Newton's method is expected to take $1$ iteration, while gradient descent is expected to take a large number of iterations that increases with the condition number of $\\mathbf{Q}$.",
