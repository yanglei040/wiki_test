This first exercise applies EUT to a classic scenario from law and economics: a lawsuit settlement. By deriving the settlement amount $S^{\\ast}$ that makes a plaintiff indifferent between settling and going to trial, you will practice translating a real-world problem into a formal economic model and solving for a key decision-making threshold . This is a fundamental skill for applying microeconomic theory.",

            "problem": "A plaintiff with initial wealth $W>0$ faces a decision between accepting a certain settlement or proceeding to trial. Under expected utility theory (EUT), the plaintiff evaluates outcomes using a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function $u(x)=\\frac{x^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$, with risk aversion parameter $\\gamma>0$ and $\\gamma\\neq 1$, defined for $x>0$.\n\nIf the plaintiff accepts a settlement of amount $S\\geq 0$, the plaintiff incurs a settlement-related cost $K_{S}\\geq 0$ and ends with certain final wealth $W+S-K_{S}$. If the plaintiff proceeds to trial, a court awards gross damages $D>0$ with probability $p\\in(0,1)$ and zero otherwise. The lawyer is compensated via a contingency fee at rate $c\\in(0,1)$ applied to the gross award, so that if the plaintiff wins, the plaintiff receives net damages $(1-c)D$. Proceeding to trial entails a plaintiff-borne litigation cost $K_{T}\\geq 0$ that is paid regardless of outcome. Thus, the plaintiff’s final wealth under trial is $W-K_{T}+(1-c)D$ with probability $p$ and $W-K_{T}$ with probability $1-p$.\n\nAssume that all relevant final wealth levels are strictly positive: $W-K_{T}>0$, $W-K_{T}+(1-c)D>0$, and $W+S-K_{S}>0$.\n\nLet $S^{\\ast}$ denote the settlement amount that makes the plaintiff indifferent between accepting the settlement and going to trial, under expected utility maximization. Derive a closed-form expression for $S^{\\ast}$ as a function of the parameters $W$, $\\gamma$, $p$, $D$, $c$, $K_{S}$, and $K_{T}$. Your final answer must be a single analytic expression. Do not approximate.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before any attempt at a solution.\n\nGivens are extracted verbatim:\n- Initial wealth: $W > 0$.\n- Utility function: $u(x) = \\frac{x^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma > 0$, $\\gamma \\neq 1$, and domain $x > 0$.\n- Settlement amount: $S \\geq 0$.\n- Settlement cost: $K_S \\geq 0$.\n- Final wealth with settlement: $W + S - K_S$.\n- Probability of winning trial: $p \\in (0,1)$.\n- Gross damages: $D > 0$.\n- Contingency fee rate: $c \\in (0,1)$.\n- Net damages: $(1-c)D$.\n- Litigation cost: $K_T \\geq 0$.\n- Final wealth with trial win: $W - K_T + (1-c)D$.\n- Final wealth with trial loss: $W - K_T$.\n- Positivity assumption: $W - K_T > 0$, $W - K_T + (1-c)D > 0$, and $W + S - K_S > 0$.\n- Objective: Derive a closed-form expression for the indifference settlement amount, $S^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in expected utility theory, a foundational concept in economics. It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and constraints defined to permit a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. All assumptions, such as the positivity of final wealth states, are explicitly stated to ensure the utility function is well-defined. The problem is therefore valid. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core principle is that the plaintiff is indifferent between two options if the utility derived from the certain option (settlement) is equal to the expected utility derived from the uncertain option (trial).\n\nLet $S^{\\ast}$ be the settlement amount that renders the plaintiff indifferent. The final wealth from accepting this settlement is a certain amount, which we denote as $W_{S^{\\ast}}$.\n$$\nW_{S^{\\ast}} = W + S^{\\ast} - K_S\n$$\nThe utility from this certain outcome is $u(W_{S^{\\ast}})$.\n\nIf the plaintiff proceeds to trial, the outcome is a lottery. Let the final wealth in the event of a win be $W_{win}$ and in the event of a loss be $W_{lose}$.\n$$\nW_{win} = W - K_T + (1-c)D\n$$\n$$\nW_{lose} = W - K_T\n$$\nThe probability of winning is $p$, and the probability of losing is $1-p$. The expected utility of the trial, denoted $E[u(\\text{Trial})]$, is the probability-weighted average of the utilities of the possible outcomes.\n$$\nE[u(\\text{Trial})] = p \\cdot u(W_{win}) + (1-p) \\cdot u(W_{lose})\n$$\nThe indifference condition is therefore:\n$$\nu(W_{S^{\\ast}}) = E[u(\\text{Trial})]\n$$\nSubstituting the specified CRRA utility function, $u(x) = \\frac{x^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$, into the indifference condition gives:\n$$\n\\frac{(W_{S^{\\ast}})^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma} = p \\frac{(W_{win})^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma} + (1-p) \\frac{(W_{lose})^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}\n$$\nSince the problem states $\\gamma \\neq 1$, the denominator $(1-\\gamma)$ is non-zero and can be cancelled from all terms by multiplication.\n$$\n(W_{S^{\\ast}})^{1-\\gamma} = p (W_{win})^{1-\\gamma} + (1-p) (W_{lose})^{1-\\gamma}\n$$\nThis equation defines the certainty equivalent relationship. The term $W_{S^{\\ast}}$ is the certainty equivalent wealth of the trial lottery, adjusted for the costs related to settlement. To solve for $W_{S^{\\ast}}$, we raise both sides of the equation to the power of $\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$.\n$$\nW_{S^{\\ast}} = \\left[ p (W_{win})^{1-\\gamma} + (1-p) (W_{lose})^{1-\\gamma} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $W_{S^{\\ast}}$, $W_{win}$, and $W_{lose}$:\n$$\nW + S^{\\ast} - K_S = \\left[ p (W - K_T + (1-c)D)^{1-\\gamma} + (1-p) (W - K_T)^{1-\\gamma} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}\n$$\nThe final step is to isolate $S^{\\ast}$ algebraically. This is a simple rearrangement.\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\left[ p(W - K_T + (1-c)D)^{1-\\gamma} + (1-p)(W - K_T)^{1-\\gamma} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}} - W + K_S\n$$\nThis expression provides the required closed-form for the indifference settlement amount $S^{\\ast}$ as a function of the given parameters. The assumption that all final wealth states are strictly positive ensures that all terms raised to a power are positive, making the expression well-defined.",

A lottery is defined by a set of possible wealth outcomes $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n\\}$ and their corresponding probabilities $P_s = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n\\}$. The problem statement permits unnormalized weights, which we will first normalize to a valid probability distribution $\\tilde{P} = \\{\\tilde{p}_1, \\tilde{p}_2, \\dots, \\tilde{p}_n\\}$, where $\\tilde{p}_i = p_i / \\sum_{j=1}^n p_j$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in Expected Utility Theory. For a given utility function $u(w)$, which quantifies an individual's preference for a certain level of wealth $w$, the expected utility of the lottery is the weighted average of the utilities of each possible outcome:\n$$\nE[u(W)] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\tilde{p}_i u(w_i)\n$$\nThe certainty equivalent, $\\mathrm{CE}$, is the amount of certain wealth that provides the same level of utility as the lottery's expected utility. It is formally defined by the equation:\n$$\nu(\\mathrm{CE}) = E[u(W)]\n$$\nIf the inverse utility function $u^{-1}(\\cdot)$ is known and simple to compute, the $\\mathrm{CE}$ can be found directly:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CE} = u^{-1}(E[u(W)])\n$$\nHowever, for many utility functions, the inverse is either not available in a closed analytical form or is computationally inconvenient. The problem mandates a more general, numerical approach: root-finding. We define a function $g(c)$ whose root is the desired certainty equivalent:\n$$\ng(c) = u(c) - E[u(W)] = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $u(\\cdot)$ is strictly increasing and continuous. This guarantees that $g(c)$ is also strictly increasing and continuous. As established during validation, a unique root for $g(c)=0$ is guaranteed to exist within the closed interval defined by the minimum and maximum possible wealth outcomes, $[\\min(W), \\max(W)]$.\n\nThis structure makes the problem amenable to a bracketing root-finding algorithm, such as Brent's method, which is robust and efficient. The algorithm will systematically narrow the search interval $[a, b]$ where $g(a)$ and $g(b)$ have opposite signs, until the root is found to a specified tolerance.\n\nThe computational procedure is thus:\n1.  **Input Validation and Normalization**: Given inputs $u$, $W$, and $p$, first ensure they are valid. Convert $W$ and $p$ to numerical arrays. Check for consistent lengths. Confirm that probabilities in $p$ are non-negative and sum to a positive value. Then, normalize $p$ to create a true probability vector $\\tilde{p}$.\n2.  **Handle Degenerate Case**: If the lottery has only one possible outcome (i.e., $\\min(W) = \\max(W)$), it is not a lottery but a certain outcome. The certainty equivalent is simply this value.\n3.  **Compute Expected Utility**: Calculate $E[u(W)] = \\sum_i \\tilde{p}_i u(w_i)$. This is a simple dot product.\n4.  **Numerical Solution**:\n    a. Define the search bracket as $[\\min(W), \\max(W)]$.\n    b. Define the objective function $g(c) = u(c) - E[u(W)]$.\n    c. Handle trivial boundary solutions: If $g(\\min(W)) \\approx 0$ or $g(\\max(W)) \\approx 0$ within a small machine epsilon, the respective boundary is the solution.\n    d. Employ a numerical solver, such as `scipy.optimize.brentq`, to find the root of $g(c)$ within the bracket and to the required absolute tolerance of $10^{-9}$.\n\nThis structured approach guarantees a correct and robust implementation that adheres to the established principles of Expected Utility Theory and numerical analysis.",
