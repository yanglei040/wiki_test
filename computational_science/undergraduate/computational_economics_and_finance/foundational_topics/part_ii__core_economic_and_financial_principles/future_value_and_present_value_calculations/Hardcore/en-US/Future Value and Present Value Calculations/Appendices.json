            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in computational finance, grounded in established principles of present value analysis, and contains all necessary and consistent information for its solution.\n\nThe present value ($PV$) of a bond is the sum of its future cash flows, each discounted to its value at time $t=0$. The cash flows consist of periodic after-tax coupon payments and the final redemption of principal. The general formula for the present value is:\n$$\nPV = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+y)^t}\n$$\nwhere $CF_t$ is the total cash flow received at the end of year $t$, $N$ is the number of years to maturity, and $y$ is the annual effective yield used for discounting.\n\nFirst, we must determine the cash flows for each year. The bond has a face value $F = \\$1{,}000$ and a maturity of $N = 6$ years. The discount yield is $y = 0.06$.\n\nStep 1: Calculate coupon payments and after-tax cash flows for years $t = 1, 2, 3$.\nThe annual coupon rate is given as $0.03$. The coupon amount $C_1$ is:\n$$\nC_1 = 0.03 \\times F = 0.03 \\times 1000 = 30\n$$\nTo find the after-tax cash flow, we apply the given tax function $\\tau(C)$:\n$$\n\\tau(C) = \n\\begin{cases}\n0.10,  \\text{if } 0 \\le C \\le 40 \\\\\n0.20,  \\text{if } 40  C \\le 60 \\\\\n0.35,  \\text{if } C  60\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor $C_1 = 30$, the tax rate is $\\tau(30) = 0.10$.\nThe after-tax cash flow, $CF_1$, for each of the first three years is:\n$$\nCF_1 = C_1 \\times (1 - \\tau(C_1)) = 30 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 30 \\times 0.90 = \\$27\n$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate coupon payments and after-tax cash flows for years $t = 4, 5, 6$.\nThe annual coupon rate is given as $0.07$. The coupon amount $C_2$ is:\n$$\nC_2 = 0.07 \\times F = 0.07 \\times 1000 = 70\n$$\nFor $C_2 = 70$, the tax rate is $\\tau(70) = 0.35$.\nThe after-tax cash flow from the coupon, $CF_2$, for each of the last three years is:\n$$\nCF_2 = C_2 \\times (1 - \\tau(C_2)) = 70 \\times (1 - 0.35) = 70 \\times 0.65 = \\$45.50\n$$\n\nStep 3: Identify the total cash flow stream.\nThe cash flow at time $t$ consists of the after-tax coupon. At maturity ($t=6$), the cash flow also includes the untaxed redemption of the principal $F = 1000$.\nThe stream of total cash flows ($CF_t$) is:\n- For $t = 1, 2, 3$: $CF_t = \\$27$\n- For $t = 4, 5$: $CF_t = \\$45.50$\n- For $t = 6$: $CF_6 = (\\text{after-tax coupon}) + (\\text{principal}) = 45.50 + 1000 = \\$1045.50$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the present value.\nThe present value is the sum of the discounted cash flows:\n$$\nPV = \\frac{27}{(1+0.06)^1} + \\frac{27}{(1+0.06)^2} + \\frac{27}{(1+0.06)^3} + \\frac{45.5}{(1+0.06)^4} + \\frac{45.5}{(1+0.06)^5} + \\frac{1045.5}{(1+0.06)^6}\n$$\nThis calculation can be organized by separating the two series of coupon payments and the final principal payment.\nThe PV can be expressed as the sum of the present value of all six after-tax coupons and the present value of the principal:\n$$\nPV = \\left( \\sum_{t=1}^{3} \\frac{27}{(1.06)^t} + \\sum_{t=4}^{6} \\frac{45.5}{(1.06)^t} \\right) + \\frac{1000}{(1.06)^6}\n$$\nWe use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity, $PV_A = P \\times \\frac{1 - (1+y)^{-n}}{y}$, where $P$ is the periodic payment. Let $a_{\\overline{n}|y} = \\frac{1 - (1+y)^{-n}}{y}$.\n\nThe present value of the first three coupons is:\n$$\nPV_{\\text{coupons}, 1-3} = 27 \\times a_{\\overline{3}|0.06} = 27 \\times \\frac{1 - (1.06)^{-3}}{0.06} \\approx 27 \\times 2.673012 = 72.171324\n$$\nThe present value of the coupons for years $4, 5, 6$ is a deferred annuity. Its value can be found by taking the difference between a $6$-year annuity and a $3$-year annuity:\n$$\nPV_{\\text{coupons}, 4-6} = 45.5 \\times (a_{\\overline{6}|0.06} - a_{\\overline{3}|0.06})\n$$\n$a_{\\overline{6}|0.06} = \\frac{1 - (1.06)^{-6}}{0.06} \\approx 4.917324$\n$$\nPV_{\\text{coupons}, 4-6} \\approx 45.5 \\times (4.917324 - 2.673012) = 45.5 \\times 2.244312 = 102.116196\n$$\nThe total present value of all after-tax coupons is:\n$$\nPV_{\\text{coupons}} \\approx 72.171324 + 102.116196 = 174.28752\n$$\nThe present value of the principal redemption is:\n$$\nPV_{\\text{principal}} = \\frac{1000}{(1.06)^6} \\approx 1000 \\times 0.70496054 = 704.96054\n$$\nThe total present value of the bond is the sum of these components:\n$$\nPV = PV_{\\text{coupons}} + PV_{\\text{principal}} \\approx 174.28752 + 704.96054 = 879.24806\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $879.24806$. The first four significant figures are $8, 7, 9, 2$. The fifth digit is $4$, so we round down.\n$$\nPV \\approx 879.2\n$$\nThe present value of the bond is expressed in dollars.",

            "problem": "You are asked to write a complete, runnable program that computes the present value of a contingent annuity with end-of-period payments that are skipped if a specified condition is not met. The condition is that a firm’s quarterly profit must be at or above a given threshold for a fixed payment to be made at the end of that quarter; otherwise, the payment is skipped for that quarter. All payments occur at the end of each quarter. All interest rates must be treated as decimals (not with a percentage sign). Assume that for every period $t$ the one-period gross return satisfies $1 + r_t  0$. The program must not require any user input.\n\nFundamental base. Use the following foundation: the time value of money under deterministic, discrete compounding and absence of arbitrage. Specifically, a present amount $v$ that is invested and compounded at per-period risk-free rates $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_t$ accumulates after $t$ periods to $v \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 + r_i)$. Use this foundation to reason about how to value cash flows that occur at future dates in present terms.\n\nProblem setup.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of financial mathematics, is well-posed with all necessary data and unambiguous conditions, and is expressed objectively. The problem is solvable as stated.\n\nThe task is to compute the present value ($PV$) of a contingent annuity over a finite horizon of $N$ quarters. The annuity provides a payment of amount $A$ at the end of each quarter $t$ if and only if the firm's profit for that quarter, $P_t$, is greater than or equal to a specified threshold, $\\theta$. The valuation must account for a deterministic but potentially time-varying sequence of per-quarter risk-free interest rates, $\\{r_t\\}_{t=1}^{N}$.\n\nThe fundamental principle for this calculation is the additivity of present values. The total present value of a stream of cash flows is the sum of the present values of each individual cash flow.\n\nFirst, we formalize the cash flow, $C_t$, that occurs at the end of each quarter $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. According to the problem's contingency rule, the cash flow is either $A$ or $0$. This can be expressed mathematically using an indicator function, $I(\\cdot)$, which takes the value $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise.\n\n$$C_t = A \\cdot I(P_t \\ge \\theta)$$\n\nNext, we must determine the present value of each cash flow $C_t$. The problem specifies the framework of discrete compounding with a term structure of one-period rates $\\{r_t\\}$. A future value at time $t$, let us call it $FV_t$, is related to its present value at time $t=0$, $PV_0$, by the formula:\n\n$$FV_t = PV_0 \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 + r_i)$$\n\nThis formula describes how a present sum accumulates value over time. To find the present value of a cash flow $C_t$ received at a future time $t$, we must reverse this process, which is known as discounting. By rearranging the formula, the present value of $C_t$ is:\n\n$$PV(C_t) = \\frac{C_t}{\\prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 + r_i)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $\\prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 + r_i)$, is the cumulative accumulation factor up to time $t$. Its reciprocal, $D_t = 1 / \\prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 + r_i)$, is the discount factor for time $t$. The problem states that $1 + r_t  0$ for all $t$, which ensures the discount factor is always well-defined and positive.\n\nBy the principle of value additivity, the total present value of the entire contingent annuity is the sum of the present values of the cash flows for each quarter from $t=1$ to $N$:\n\n$$PV_{total} = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} PV(C_t) = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} C_t \\cdot D_t$$\n\nSubstituting our expressions for $C_t$ and $D_t$, we arrive at the complete formula for the desired present value:\n\n$$PV_{total} = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\left( A \\cdot I(P_t \\ge \\theta) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 + r_i)} \\right)$$\n\nTo implement this calculation algorithmically, we proceed as follows for each test case:\n1.  Let the sequences of profits and rates be represented as arrays $\\{P_t\\}_{t=1}^{N}$ and $\\{r_t\\}_{t=1}^{N}$.\n2.  First, we establish the sequence of contingent cash flows. For each $t$ from $1$ to $N$, we check if $P_t \\ge \\theta$. If true, the cash flow is $A$; otherwise, it is $0$. This generates a sequence of cash flows $\\{C_t\\}_{t=1}^{N}$.\n3.  Next, we compute the term structure of discount factors. The discount factor for each period $t$ depends on the cumulative product of the gross returns $(1 + r_i)$. Let $Z_t = \\prod_{i=1}^{t} (1 + r_i)$ be the cumulative accumulation factor. This can be computed iteratively, where $Z_t = Z_{t-1} \\cdot (1 + r_t)$, with an initial $Z_0=1$. The discount factor is then $D_t = 1/Z_t$.\n4.  For each quarter $t$, we calculate the discounted cash flow by multiplying the cash flow $C_t$ by the corresponding discount factor $D_t$.\n5.  Finally, we sum these discounted cash flows over all $N$ quarters to obtain the total present value.\n\nThis procedure, based on first principles of asset valuation, will be applied to each of the provided test cases to yield the final numerical solutions.",
