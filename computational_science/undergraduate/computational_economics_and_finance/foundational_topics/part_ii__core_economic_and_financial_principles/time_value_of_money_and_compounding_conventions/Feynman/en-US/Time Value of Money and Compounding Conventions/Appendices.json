            "introduction": "While many introductory exercises assume a single, constant interest rate for simplicity, real-world financial environments feature interest rates that vary over time. This first practice moves beyond this simplification by asking you to calculate the present value of an annuity using a given term structure of interest rates, where each future period has a different discount rate. This exercise reinforces the fundamental principle of discounting from first principles, where each cash flow must be discounted individually using the appropriate rate path. ",

            "problem": "A project pays a level cash flow of $A$ dollars at the end of each year for $n$ years, where $A = 12{,}000$ and $n = 6$. The economy has a deterministic term structure described by the one-year effective rate $r_k$ applicable to the period from year $k-1$ to year $k$, with $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Assume discrete compounding that is consistent with these period-specific effective rates, and that the cash flows are received at the end of each period. The rates are:\n- $r_1 = 0.030$\n- $r_2 = 0.033$\n- $r_3 = 0.036$\n- $r_4 = 0.038$\n- $r_5 = 0.041$\n- $r_6 = 0.043$\n\nCompute the present value at time $0$ of this annuity.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\nGivens are extracted as stated:\n- Level annual cash flow, $A = 12000$ dollars.\n- Number of payments, $n = 6$ years.\n- Timing of cash flows: End of each year for $n$ years.\n- The term structure of interest rates is given by the one-year effective rate $r_k$ for the period from year $k-1$ to year $k$.\n- $r_1 = 0.030$\n- $r_2 = 0.033$\n- $r_3 = 0.036$\n- $r_4 = 0.038$\n- $r_5 = 0.041$\n- $r_6 = 0.043$\n- Compounding is discrete.\n- The objective is to compute the present value, $PV$, at time $t=0$.\n- The final answer must be rounded to four significant figures and expressed in dollars.\n\nThe problem is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of financial mathematics, specifically the time value of money. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution, and its terms are objective and unambiguous. There are no contradictions, missing data, or violations of scientific principles. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe present value ($PV$) of a series of cash flows is the sum of the discounted values of each individual cash flow. A cash flow received at a future time is discounted to its value at time $t=0$ using the prevailing interest rates for the intervening period.\n\nIn this problem, a constant cash flow of $A$ is received at the end of each year $k$, for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The discount rate is not constant; it follows a specified term structure. The one-year effective rate $r_j$ applies to the interval from year $j-1$ to year $j$.\n\nTo find the present value of a single cash flow $A$ received at the end of year $k$, we must discount it back through each preceding year using the corresponding one-year rate. The discount factor for a cash flow at year $k$ is the product of the individual one-year discount factors.\n\nThe present value of the cash flow at year $k=1$ is:\n$$ PV_1 = \\frac{A}{1+r_1} $$\nThe present value of the cash flow at year $k=2$ is:\n$$ PV_2 = \\frac{A}{(1+r_1)(1+r_2)} $$\nGeneralizing, the present value of the cash flow at year $k$ is given by:\n$$ PV_k = \\frac{A}{\\prod_{j=1}^{k} (1+r_j)} $$\nThe total present value of the annuity is the sum of the present values of each of the $n$ cash flows:\n$$ PV = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} PV_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{A}{\\prod_{j=1}^{k} (1+r_j)} $$\nGiven $A=12000$ and $n=6$, we can write the full expression:\n$$ PV = A \\left( \\frac{1}{1+r_1} + \\frac{1}{(1+r_1)(1+r_2)} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{\\prod_{j=1}^{6} (1+r_j)} \\right) $$\nLet us define the cumulative discount term $D_k = \\prod_{j=1}^{k} (1+r_j)$.

            "problem": "You will implement a bracketing root-finding algorithm to compute the yield-to-maturity (YTM) of coupon-bearing and zero-coupon bonds. The YTM is the nominal annual interest rate (compounded at a specified frequency per year) that makes the present value of all future cash flows equal to the current market price. This task must be formulated as a scalar root-finding problem in a single unknown, solved using a bracketing method on a continuous function, and justified from first principles.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Time value of money: the present value of a future cash flow equals its amount multiplied by an appropriate discount factor derived from the nominal annual yield, the compounding frequency, and elapsed time.\n- Continuity and monotonicity: for a stream of strictly positive cash flows discounted by a nominal annual yield compounded a fixed number of times per year, the present value is a continuous and strictly decreasing function of the yield.\n- Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT): if a continuous function on a closed interval takes values of opposite sign at the endpoints, then it has at least one root in that interval.\n\nDefine the scalar function as follows. Let the nominal annual yield be the unknown $y$. Let the compounding frequency be $m$ payments per year, with $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and assume $m T \\in \\mathbb{N}$ so the total number of periods is an integer. For a bond with face value $F$, annual coupon rate $c$ (as a decimal fraction per year), maturity $T$ years, and current market price $P$, define $f(y)$ to be the difference between the present value of all future coupon payments and the redemption amount, discounted using the nominal annual yield $y$ with compounding frequency $m$, and the observed price $P$. The YTM is any $y$ such that $f(y) = 0$ subject to the financial feasibility condition $1 + y/m > 0$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Implement a bracketing method for root finding (for example, the bisection method or the false-position method) that uses only function evaluations and interval endpoints, and guarantees convergence for continuous functions with a sign change, without relying on derivative information. You must use a fixed initial bracket $[-0.99, 3.0]$ and verify that $f(y_{\\min}) \\cdot f(y_{\\max}) \\le 0$ for each test case. If the initial bracket does not straddle a root, you must expand the bracket conservatively while maintaining the feasibility condition $1 + y/m > 0$ until a sign change is found or a reasonable expansion limit is reached. \n- For each bond, compute the present value by discounting each cash flow at the per-period rate implied by the nominal annual yield $y$ compounded $m$ times per year, summing over all cash flows at their respective period indices. The per-period discount factor must enforce the financial feasibility condition $1 + y/m > 0$.\n- Use a stopping criterion that ensures the absolute width of the bracketing interval is less than or equal to a specified tolerance $\\varepsilon$ or the absolute function value at the midpoint is less than or equal to a specified tolerance $\\delta$. Use $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$ and $\\delta = 10^{-12}$, and a maximum of $10{,}000$ iterations per root find.\n- Produce results in units of decimal fraction per year (no percent sign). Angles are not involved. Monetary values are in arbitrary consistent units; no currency symbol is required.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each case, parameters are given as $(F, c, m, T, P)$ with the conventions above. Assume $m T \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n- Case $1$ (general coupon bond, discount): $(F=1000, c=0.05, m=2, T=5, P=950)$.\n- Case $2$ (zero-coupon, positive yield): $(F=1000, c=0.0, m=1, T=3, P=850)$.\n- Case $3$ (par bond, consistency check): $(F=1000, c=0.04, m=2, T=7, P=1000)$.\n- Case $4$ (zero-coupon, negative yield): $(F=1000, c=0.0, m=1, T=1, P=1005)$.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- For each test case, output the YTM as a floating-point number in decimal fraction per year, rounded to exactly $10$ decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as Cases $1$ through $4$. For example, the output format must be exactly like $[y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4]$ with each $y_k$ rounded to $10$ decimal places.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated. All givens were extracted and checked against criteria for scientific soundness, completeness, and objectivity. The problem is well-posed, grounded in established financial mathematics, and contains no ambiguities, contradictions, or factual errors. The parameters provided for the test cases are physically and financially plausible. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe central task is to determine the yield-to-maturity (YTM), denoted by $y$, for a set of bonds. The YTM is the nominal annual interest rate that equates the present value of a bond's future cash flows to its current market price. This is a root-finding problem for a scalar function of the yield, $y$.\n\nFirst, we must construct this function from first principles. Let a bond have a face value $F$, an annual coupon rate $c$, a maturity of $T$ years, and a coupon compounding frequency of $m$ times per year. The problem specifies that the total number of periods, $N = mT$, is an integer.\n\nThe total cash flow from the bond consists of two components: periodic coupon payments and the final redemption of the face value.\nThe annual coupon amount is $cF$. Since there are $m$ payments per year, each coupon payment is $C = \\frac{cF}{m}$. These payments occur at the end of each period, for a total of $N = mT$ periods.\nAt the end of the final period, $N$, the face value $F$ is also returned.\nThus, the cash flow at the end of period $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$ is $C_k = C$, and the cash flow at the final period $N$ is $C_N = C + F$.\n\nThe principle of the time value of money states that a future cash flow must be discounted to find its present value. Let $y$ be the nominal annual yield. The per-period yield is $r = \\frac{y}{m}$. The discount factor for a cash flow at period $k$ is $(1+r)^{-k} = (1 + y/m)^{-k}$. A critical condition for financial feasibility is that the discount rate must be well-defined, requiring $1 + y/m > 0$.\n\nThe total present value of all future cash flows, $\\text{PV}(y)$, is the sum of the discounted values of each cash flow:\n$$ \\text{PV}(y) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{C_k}{(1 + y/m)^k} $$\nSubstituting the specific cash flows for a coupon-bearing bond ($c>0$):\n$$ \\text{PV}(y) = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{C}{(1+y/m)^k} \\right) + \\frac{F}{(1+y/m)^N} $$\nwhere $C = \\frac{cF}{m}$ and $N=mT$. For a zero-coupon bond ($c=0$), the coupon payments are zero, and the formula simplifies to the present value of a single lump sum:\n$$ \\text{PV}(y) = \\frac{F}{(1+y/m)^N} $$\nThe problem defines the function to be solved, $f(y)$, as the difference between the present value of cash flows and the market price $P$:\n$$ f(y) = \\text{PV}(y) - P = 0 $$\nFor any set of positive cash flows, the function $\\text{PV}(y)$ is a continuous and strictly decreasing function of $y$ over its feasible domain $y > -m$. Consequently, $f(y)$ is also a continuous and strictly decreasing function. This monotonicity guarantees that if a root exists, it is unique.\n\nThe existence of a root within an interval is guaranteed by the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT), which states that for a continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$, if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, there must be at least one value $y^* \\in (a, b)$ such that $f(y^*) = 0$. This is the theoretical foundation for bracketing root-finding methods.\n\nWe will implement the bisection method, a robust and simple bracketing algorithm that does not require derivative information. Its convergence is guaranteed, albeit at a linear rate, which is acceptable for the required precision.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. Initialize the search bracket. The problem specifies an initial bracket $[a, b] = [y_{\\min}, y_{\\max}] = [-0.99, 3.0]$. We must verify that this bracket is valid, i.e., $f(a) \\cdot f(b) \\le 0$. Given that $f(y)$ is monotonically decreasing, we expect $f(a) > 0$ and $f(b) < 0$. If this condition does not hold, the bracket must be expanded. Since $f(y) \\to \\infty$ as $y \\to -m^+$ and $f(y) \\to -P < 0$ as $y \\to \\infty$, a bracket satisfying the IVT condition is guaranteed to exist. An expansion logic would increase $b$ if $f(b)>0$ and decrease $a$ (towards $-m$) if $f(a)<0$. For the specified test cases, the initial bracket $[-0.99, 3.0]$ is sufficient and requires no expansion.\n\n$2$. Iterate until a stopping criterion is met. In each iteration:\n   a. Calculate the midpoint of the current interval: $y_{\\text{mid}} = a + \\frac{b-a}{2}$. This formulation is preferred over $(a+b)/2$ to avoid potential floating-point overflow with large-magnitude numbers.\n   b. Evaluate the function at the midpoint, $f(y_{\\text{mid}})$.\n   c. Check the stopping criteria. The process terminates if the interval width is sufficiently small, $|b-a| \\le \\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$, or if the function value at the midpoint is close to zero, $|f(y_{\\text{mid}})| \\le \\delta = 10^{-12}$. A limit on the number of iterations ($10,000$) is also enforced to prevent infinite loops.\n   d. Update the bracket. Based on the sign of $f(y_{\\text{mid}})$, the half of the interval that is guaranteed to not contain the root is discarded. If $f(y_{\\text{mid}})$ has the same sign as $f(a)$, the new interval becomes $[y_{\\text{mid}}, b]$. Otherwise, it becomes $[a, y_{\\text{mid}}]$. As we established $f(a)>0$ is expected, if $f(y_{\\text{mid}})>0$ the root lies in $[y_{\\text{mid}},b]$, so we set $a = y_{\\text{mid}}$. If $f(y_{\\text{mid}})<0$, the root lies in $[a, y_{\\text{mid}}]$, so we set $b = y_{\\text{mid}}$.\n\n$3$. The final result is the midpoint of the last computed interval, which approximates the root $y^*$ with a guaranteed error bound.\n\nThis method will be applied to each test case to compute the corresponding YTM. The calculations are performed using floating-point arithmetic, and the final results are rounded to $10$ decimal places as required.",
