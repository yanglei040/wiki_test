            "problem": "In a competitive market studied in computational economics and finance, the quantity demanded by consumers is given by the linear demand schedule $Q_{d}(P_{d}) = 120 - 3P_{d}$, where $P_{d}$ is the price paid by consumers, and the quantity supplied by producers is given by the linear supply schedule $Q_{s}(P_{s}) = -20 + 2P_{s}$, where $P_{s}$ is the price received by producers. A per-unit tax of $T = 10$ is imposed such that the tax wedge satisfies $P_{d} - P_{s} = T$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of competitive equilibrium (market clearing requires $Q_{d} = Q_{s}$) and the tax wedge condition ($P_{d} - P_{s} = T$), and without assuming any shortcut formulas, derive the necessary system in the endogenous prices and solve for the equilibrium quantity $Q^{\\ast}$. Report $Q^{\\ast}$ as a real number; no rounding is necessary.",

The concepts of linear demand and supply schedules, market equilibrium, and tax incidence are fundamental to the discipline. The problem is well-posed, providing a sufficient number of independent equations to solve for the unknown variables. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not contain contradictory information or unrealistic assumptions for a theoretical model. The problem is a straightforward application of solving a system of linear equations in an economic context.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental conditions provided. The condition for market equilibrium is that the quantity demanded must equal the quantity supplied. Let this equilibrium quantity be denoted by $Q^{\\ast}$.\n$$Q^{\\ast} = Q_{d} = Q_{s}$$\nSubstituting the given functional forms for the demand and supply schedules, we obtain the first equation:\n$$120 - 3P_{d} = -20 + 2P_{s}$$\nThis equation relates the price paid by the consumer, $P_{d}$, to the price received by the producer, $P_{s}$. It can be rearranged into a standard form for a linear equation:\n$$3P_{d} + 2P_{s} = 120 + 20$$\n$$3P_{d} + 2P_{s} = 140 \\quad (\\text{Equation 1})$$\nThe second condition is the tax wedge, which relates the consumer price and the producer price through the per-unit tax $T = 10$.\n$$P_{d} - P_{s} = T$$\nSubstituting the value of $T$, we get the second equation:\n$$P_{d} - P_{s} = 10 \\quad (\\text{Equation 2})$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $P_{d}$ and $P_{s}$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n3P_{d} + 2P_{s} = 140 \\\\\nP_{d} - P_{s} = 10\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of substitution. From Equation 2, we can express $P_{d}$ in terms of $P_{s}$:\n$$P_{d} = P_{s} + 10$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P_{d}$ into Equation 1:\n$$3(P_{s} + 10) + 2P_{s} = 140$$\nWe distribute the coefficient $3$:\n$$3P_{s} + 30 + 2P_{s} = 140$$\nCombine the terms involving $P_{s}$:\n$$5P_{s} + 30 = 140$$\nIsolate the term with $P_{s}$ by subtracting $30$ from both sides:\n$$5P_{s} = 110$$\nSolve for the producer price $P_{s}$ by dividing by $5$:\n$$P_{s} = \\frac{110}{5} = 22$$\nNow that $P_{s}$ is determined, we can find the consumer price $P_{d}$ using the relationship $P_{d} = P_{s} + 10$:\n$$P_{d} = 22 + 10 = 32$$\nThe problem requires the determination of the equilibrium quantity $Q^{\\ast}$. This can be found by substituting either $P_{d}$ into the demand function or $P_{s}$ into the supply function. We will perform both calculations as a consistency check.\n\nUsing the demand function $Q_{d}(P_{d}) = 120 - 3P_{d}$:\n$$Q^{\\ast} = 120 - 3(32)$$\n$$Q^{\\ast} = 120 - 96$$\n$$Q^{\\ast} = 24$$\n\nUsing the supply function $Q_{s}(P_{s}) = -20 + 2P_{s}$:\n$$Q^{\\ast} = -20 + 2(22)$$\n$$Q^{\\ast} = -20 + 44$$\n$$Q^{\\ast} = 24$$\nThe results from both calculations are identical, which confirms the correctness of our derived prices. The equilibrium quantity in the market after the imposition of the tax is $24$.",

Let the portfolio weights be $(w_A, w_B)$ on $(A, B)$, and assume frictionless markets with short-selling allowed.

            "solution": "The problem statement is submitted for validation.\n\nFirst, the givens are extracted verbatim.\n- Expected return of Asset A: $\\mu_A = 0.08$\n- Expected return of Asset B: $\\mu_B = 0.12$\n- Portfolio weights on Asset A and Asset B: $(w_A, w_B)$\n- Market assumptions: Frictionless markets, short-selling allowed.\n- Self-financing constraint: $w_A + w_B = 1$\n- Target expected return constraint: $\\mu_P = w_A \\mu_A + w_B \\mu_B$\n- Target portfolio expected return: $\\mu_P = 0.06$\n\nNext, the problem is validated against the required criteria.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in modern portfolio theory, a fundamental subfield of computational economics and finance. It uses standard definitions for expected return, portfolio weights, and constraints. The concepts are scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem describes a system of two linear equations in two variables, $(w_A, w_B)$:\n    $$w_A + w_B = 1$$\n    $$0.08 w_A + 0.12 w_B = 0.06$$\n    The coefficient matrix for this system is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0.08 & 0.12 \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $1 \\times 0.12 - 1 \\times 0.08 = 0.04$. Since the determinant is non-zero, a unique solution for $(w_A, w_B)$ exists. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective mathematical and financial terminology. There is no ambiguity or subjective content.\n4.  **Completeness**: All necessary data and constraints are provided to find a unique solution.\n\nThe problem statement is deemed valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe task is to solve the system of two linear equations for the portfolio weights $w_A$ and $w_B$:\nEquation (1): $w_A + w_B = 1$\nEquation (2): $w_A \\mu_A + w_B \\mu_B = \\mu_P$\n\nSubstitute the given numerical values into Equation (2):\n$0.08 w_A + 0.12 w_B = 0.06$\n\nFrom Equation (1), we can express $w_B$ in terms of $w_A$:\n$w_B = 1 - w_A$\n\nSubstitute this expression into the rewritten Equation (2):\n$0.08 w_A + 0.12 (1 - w_A) = 0.06$\n\nApply the distributive property:\n$0.08 w_A + 0.12 - 0.12 w_A = 0.06$\n\nGroup the terms containing $w_A$:\n$(0.08 - 0.12) w_A = 0.06 - 0.12$\n$-0.04 w_A = -0.06$\n\nSolve for $w_A$:\n$w_A = \\frac{-0.06}{-0.04} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5$\n\nNow, use Equation (1) to solve for $w_B$:\n$w_B = 1 - w_A = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5$\n\nThe solution for the weights is $(w_A, w_B) = (1.5, -0.5)$.\n\nThe economic interpretation of these weights must be analyzed. The target return $\\mu_P = 0.06$ is less than the expected returns of both assets ($\\mu_A = 0.08$ and $\\mu_B = 0.12$). A portfolio consisting of only long positions in these two assets would have an expected return that is a convex combination of their individual returns, i.e., $\\mu_P \\in [\\min(\\mu_A, \\mu_B), \\max(\\mu_A, \\mu_B)]$, which is $[0.08, 0.12]$. To achieve a target return outside this interval, short-selling is required.\n\nTo achieve a return *below* the interval, one must short the asset with the *higher* expected return and use the proceeds to take a larger, or leveraged, position in the asset with the *lower* expected return. Here, Asset B has the higher return ($\\mu_B = 0.12$), so we expect it to be shorted. Our calculation confirms this: $w_B = -0.5$. This represents a short position in Asset B equal to $50\\%$ of the portfolio's principal. The proceeds from this short sale ($0.5$ units of capital) are added to the initial principal ($1$ unit) and invested in Asset A, resulting in a leveraged long position of $w_A = 1.5$, or $150\\%$ of the portfolio's principal. This strategy drives the portfolio's expected return down to the target of $0.06$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. $(w_A, w_B) = (1.5, -0.5)$; the negative weight on $B$ means a short position in $B$, whose short-sale proceeds finance a leveraged long in $A$, allowing the portfolio expected return to lie below both assets’ expected returns.\nThe calculated weights $(1.5, -0.5)$ match this option. The economic interpretation is entirely correct. A short position in the higher-return asset (B) is required to finance a leveraged position in the lower-return asset (A) to achieve a target return below what is possible with a long-only portfolio.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. $(w_A, w_B) = (0.5, 0.5)$; no shorting is needed because naive diversification always spans any target between $0$ and $1$.\nThe weights are incorrect. A portfolio with $(w_A, w_B) = (0.5, 0.5)$ has an expected return of $0.5(0.08) + 0.5(0.12) = 0.04 + 0.06 = 0.10$, not the target $0.06$. The reasoning is fallacious; long-only diversification can only achieve returns within the range of the constituent assets' returns, $[0.08, 0.12]$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $(w_A, w_B) = (-0.5, 1.5)$; the negative weight on $A$ means a short in $A$ to drag the expected return down to the target.\nThe weights are incorrect; they are reversed. Such a portfolio would have an expected return of $(-0.5)(0.08) + (1.5)(0.12) = -0.04 + 0.18 = 0.14$, which is not the target. Furthermore, shorting the lower-return asset (A) and leveraging the higher-return asset (B) would push the portfolio return *up*, not down.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $(w_A, w_B) = (0.75, 0.25)$; both weights are positive, so the target below both assets’ expected returns is attainable without shorting by sufficiently underweighting the higher-return asset.\nThe weights are incorrect. This portfolio has an expected return of $0.75(0.08) + 0.25(0.12) = 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.09$, not the target $0.06$. The premise that a target below both asset returns is achievable without shorting is fundamentally false. A portfolio with $w_A, w_B > 0$ cannot have an expected return outside the range $[\\mu_A, \\mu_B]$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
