However, this exercise reveals a subtle but critical numerical pitfall known as catastrophic cancellation, which occurs when subtracting two nearly-equal floating-point numbers. By working through this problem , you will see how the standard quadratic formula can fail dramatically and learn how a simple algebraic rearrangement can restore full accuracy, a foundational skill for writing robust numerical code.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before any attempt at a solution is made.\n\nFirst, we extract the givens of the problem.\nThe quadratic polynomial is given as $p(x) = x^2 - 10^8 x + 1$.\nThe problem requires finding the roots of the equation $p(x) = 0$.\nThe analysis of numerical stability must be performed within the context of finite precision floating-point arithmetic, specifically referencing the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) $754$ double precision standard.\nThe task involves identifying which root expression derived from the standard quadratic formula is numerically unstable due to \"catastrophic cancellation\", and subsequently deriving an algebraically equivalent, but numerically stable, expression for that root.\n\nNext, we validate the problem statement.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it deals with a fundamental topic in numerical analysis: the loss of precision when subtracting nearly equal numbers. This phenomenon, known as catastrophic cancellation, is a well-understood consequence of floating-point arithmetic. The polynomial and coefficients are mathematically sound.\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information ($a=1$, $b=-10^8$, $c=1$) to find the roots and analyze their numerical properties. The question is unambiguous and leads to a unique set of stable expressions for the roots.\nThe problem is objective, stated in precise mathematical terms without any subjective or speculative content.\nTherefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe quadratic equation to be solved is $x^2 - 10^8 x + 1 = 0$.\nWe apply the standard quadratic formula for the roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, which are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nFor the given polynomial, the coefficients are $a=1$, $b=-10^8$, and $c=1$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula yields:\n$$x = \\frac{-(-10^8) \\pm \\sqrt{(-10^8)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{10^8 \\pm \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{2}$$\nThis gives two exact, real roots:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{10^8 + \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{2}$$\n$$x_2 = \\frac{10^8 - \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{2}$$\n\nNow, we must analyze the numerical stability of these expressions in finite precision arithmetic. The source of potential instability lies in the subtraction of nearly equal quantities.\nLet us examine the magnitude of the terms involved. The term $10^{16}$ is vastly larger than $4$. Consequently, the value of $\\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}$ is very close to $\\sqrt{10^{16}} = 10^8$.\nTo see this more clearly, we can use a binomial approximation.\n$$\\sqrt{10^{16} - 4} = \\sqrt{10^{16}(1 - 4 \\times 10^{-16})} = 10^8 \\sqrt{1 - 4 \\times 10^{-16}}$$\nFor a small value $\\epsilon$, the approximation $(1 - \\epsilon)^{1/2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon$ holds. Here, $\\epsilon = 4 \\times 10^{-16}$, which is very small.\nThus, $\\sqrt{10^{16} - 4} \\approx 10^8 (1 - \\frac{1}{2}(4 \\times 10^{-16})) = 10^8 (1 - 2 \\times 10^{-16}) = 10^8 - 2 \\times 10^{-8}$.\nThe value of $\\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}$ is only slightly less than $10^8$.\n\nConsider the expression for $x_1$: $x_1 = \\frac{10^8 + \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{2}$. This expression involves the addition of two large positive numbers of similar magnitude. In floating-point arithmetic, this operation is numerically stable. The relative error of the sum is small, on the order of the machine precision.\n\nConsider the expression for $x_2$: $x_2 = \\frac{10^8 - \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{2}$. This expression involves the subtraction of two very nearly equal numbers. Let $y = \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}$. In floating-point computation, $10^8$ and the computed value of $y$ will agree in many of their leading significant digits. When the subtraction $10^8 - y$ is performed, these leading digits cancel, and the result is determined by the remaining, less significant digits, which are heavily influenced by the rounding errors incurred when computing $y$. This massive increase in relative error is the phenomenon of catastrophic cancellation. Therefore, the expression for $x_2$ is numerically unstable and would yield a highly inaccurate result if evaluated directly using standard double-precision arithmetic.\n\nTo find a numerically stable expression for $x_2$, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to its roots. For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the product of the roots is given by $x_1 x_2 = \\frac{c}{a}$.\nFor our equation, this gives $x_1 x_2 = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\nWe can compute the stable root $x_1$ accurately using its formula. Then, we can find $x_2$ from the relation $x_2 = \\frac{1}{x_1}$.\nSubstituting the stable expression for $x_1$:\n$$x_2 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{10^8 + \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{10^8 + \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}$$\nThis revised expression for $x_2$ involves only the addition of positive numbers and a division, both of which are numerically stable operations. It avoids subtractive cancellation and is therefore the preferred form for numerical computation.\n\nWe verify that this new form is algebraically equivalent to the original unstable form for $x_2$ by rationalizing its denominator:\n$$\\frac{2}{10^8 + \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}} \\cdot \\frac{10^8 - \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{10^8 - \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}} = \\frac{2(10^8 - \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4})}{(10^8)^2 - (10^{16} - 4)} = \\frac{2(10^8 - \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4})}{10^{16} - 10^{16} + 4} = \\frac{2(10^8 - \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4})}{4} = \\frac{10^8 - \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{2}$$\nThis confirms the algebraic identity.\n\nThe final required answer consists of the exact symbolic expressions for both roots, rewritten in their numerically stable forms.\nThe larger root is $x_1 = \\frac{10^8 + \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}{2}$.\nThe smaller root, in its stable form, is $x_2 = \\frac{2}{10^8 + \\sqrt{10^{16} - 4}}$.",

We will analyze the leading-order term of this error for each algorithm.\n\nAlgorithm A computes $p(x)$ directly as $f_A(x) = 1 - \\exp(-x)$. The computation in floating-point arithmetic is modeled as follows. Let $fl(\\cdot)$ denote a floating-point operation.\nThe evaluation of $\\exp(-x)$ results in a floating-point number $\\hat{y} = fl(\\exp(-x)) = \\exp(-x)(1 + \\delta_{1})$, where $|\\delta_{1}| \\leq u$.\nThe subsequent subtraction gives the final computed value $\\hat{p}_A(x) = fl(1 - \\hat{y}) = (1 - \\hat{y})(1 + \\delta_{2})$, where $|\\delta_{2}| \\leq u$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\hat{y}$:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_A(x) = (1 - \\exp(-x)(1 + \\delta_{1}))(1 + \\delta_{2})\n$$\nExpanding this and keeping only first-order terms in $\\delta_i$:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_A(x) \\approx (1 - \\exp(-x) - \\delta_{1}\\exp(-x))(1 + \\delta_{2}) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-x) + \\delta_{2}(1 - \\exp(-x)) - \\delta_{1}\\exp(-x)\n$$\nThe absolute error is $E_A(x) = \\hat{p}_A(x) - p(x)$:\n$$\nE_A(x) \\approx [1 - \\exp(-x) + \\delta_{2}(1 - \\exp(-x)) - \\delta_{1}\\exp(-x)] - [1 - \\exp(-x)] = \\delta_{2}(1 - \\exp(-x)) - \\delta_{1}\\exp(-x)\n$$\nThe relative error for Algorithm A is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{RelErr}_A(x) = \\frac{|E_A(x)|}{|p(x)|} \\approx \\frac{|\\delta_{2}(1 - \\exp(-x)) - \\delta_{1}\\exp(-x)|}{|1 - \\exp(-x)|} = \\left| \\delta_{2} - \\delta_{1} \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{1 - \\exp(-x)} \\right|\n$$\nFor small $x  0$, we have $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1$ and $1 - \\exp(-x) \\approx x$.

The error of this algorithm has two components: truncation error and round-off error.\nThe truncation error arises from approximating $p(x)$ with a finite polynomial. The Taylor series for $p(x)$ around $x=0$ is:\n$$\np(x) = 1 - \\exp(-x) = 1 - \\left(1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\dots \\right) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{6} - \\dots\n$$\nThe truncation error is $T_B(x) = p(x) - f_B(x) = (\\frac{x^3}{6} - \\dots)$.

A standard analysis shows the relative round-off error is bounded by a small multiple of the unit roundoff $u$. For the small values of $x$ where this approximation is useful, the truncation error term $\\frac{x^2}{6}$ is significantly larger than the round-off error term, which is of order $u$. Thus, the leading-order error for Algorithm B is its truncation error.\n$$\n\\text{RelErr}_B(x) \\approx \\frac{x^2}{6}\n$$\nWe are required to find the value $x^*$ where the leading-order relative errors are equal:\n$$\n\\text{RelErr}_A(x^*) = \\text{RelErr}_B(x^*) \\implies u \\frac{\\exp(-x^*)}{1 - \\exp(-x^*)} = \\frac{(x^*)^2}{6}\n$$\nTo solve for $x^*$, we use small-$x$ approximations for the terms on the left-hand side, as this is the regime where the problem is posed.

            "problem": "You are given a task in computational economics and finance to quantify the impact of floating-point round-off error when aggregating long series of small asset returns and to mitigate it using a compensated summation algorithm. Consider a sequence of real-valued returns $\\{r_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, where the mathematically exact cumulative return is the real sum $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i$. In actual computation with binary floating-point arithmetic, the operation of addition is modeled by the standard floating-point rounding model: for any two real numbers $a$ and $b$, the computed value of their sum is $\\operatorname{fl}(a+b) = (a+b)(1+\\delta)$ with $|\\delta| \\le u$, where $u$ is the unit round-off, for example $u = 2^{-53}$ for binary sixty-four-bit floating point. In long sums with heterogeneous magnitudes and signs, naive left-to-right summation accumulates round-off error and can lose low-order bits, especially when adding very small values to a much larger partial sum, a phenomenon relevant when aggregating small daily returns over long horizons.\n\nYour task is to write a complete, runnable program that:\n- Implements two methods to sum a given ordered sequence of returns in floating-point arithmetic:\n  1. A naive left-to-right summation that accumulates in a single scalar.\n  2. A compensated summation method due to Kahan that tracks and corrects for low-order bits lost to rounding without changing the order of the sequence.\n- Computes a high-precision baseline for the mathematically exact sum $S$ using exact rational arithmetic by interpreting each return as a decimal fraction with a fixed denominator $D = 10^{16}$ and summing the numerators as integers. Specifically, for each decimal return $r_i$ with at most $16$ digits after the decimal point, interpret $r_i$ as the exact rational $\\frac{\\lfloor r_i \\cdot D \\rceil}{D}$, where rounding is exact for the values provided below (no rounding is needed for the given test suite).

No physical units or angle units are involved.\n- All summations must be performed in the specified order; no reordering is permitted.\n- The final output must aggregate the results for all test cases into a single line containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each element of this list must itself be a list of the form $[e_n, e_k, b]$, where $e_n$ is the absolute error of naive summation (a floating-point number), $e_k$ is the absolute error of Kahan-compensated summation (a floating-point number), and $b$ is a boolean equal to $\\text{True}$ if $e_k  e_n$ and $\\text{False}$ otherwise. For example: $[[e_{n,1}, e_{k,1}, b_1],[e_{n,2}, e_{k,2}, b_2],\\dots]$.\n\nTest suite and coverage:\n- Use the following four ordered sequences, each specified compactly as a list of segments $(v, c)$ meaning the value $v$ appears $c$ times consecutively in that order. All values are decimal strings and all counts are nonnegative integers.

Mixed magnitudes with severe cancellation and many tiny terms:\n     - $\\left(\"1e-16\",\\, 300000\\right)$, then $\\left(\"1.0\",\\, 1\\right)$, then $\\left(\"-1.0\",\\, 1\\right)$, then $\\left(\"1e-16\",\\, 300000\\right)$, then $\\left(\"-1e-16\",\\, 600000\\right)$.

For binary sixty-four-bit format, one has $u = 2^{-53} \\approx 1.11 \\times 10^{-16}$. In summing a long sequence $\\{r_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, the naive left-to-right algorithm updates a running total $s$ by $s \\leftarrow \\operatorname{fl}(s + r_i)$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$. The cumulative forward error of naive summation can be bounded by well-known results of backward error analysis: roughly, the absolute error grows on the order of $u$ times the sum of magnitudes, that is\n$$\n|s_{\\text{naive}} - S| \\lesssim \\gamma_n \\sum_{i=1}^n |r_i|, \\quad \\gamma_n = \\frac{nu}{1 - nu},\n$$\nas long as $nu  1$, highlighting an $O(nu)$ growth in error and the sensitivity to the ordering and cancellation structure. In particular, when adding very small $r_i$ into a much larger running total $s$, if $|r_i|  \\tfrac{1}{2}\\operatorname{ulp}(s)$, then $s + r_i$ rounds back to $s$ and the low-order bits of $r_i$ are effectively dropped, a phenomenon that becomes economically relevant in aggregating many small daily returns when the horizon is long and offsets arise from large gains or losses.\n\nTo mitigate this loss, the Kahan compensated summation introduces an auxiliary variable $c$ that tracks a running compensation for the low-order bits lost to rounding. The idea is to pre-subtract the compensation from the next addend and to update the compensation by the rounding error observed in the last addition. Specifically, let $s$ be the running sum and $c$ the compensation, both initialized to $0$. For each addend $x$, define the compensated addend $y = x - c$ and form the tentative sum $t = s + y$. The new compensation is the part of $y$ that was not captured in $t$, which algebraically is $c \\leftarrow (t - s) - y$, and the running sum is updated as $s \\leftarrow t$. In exact arithmetic, $(t - s) = y$, so $c$ would remain zero, but in floating-point arithmetic $(t - s)$ may differ from $y$ by the rounding of $s + y$, and this difference is stored in $c$ to be fed back on the next step. This produces a first-order correction for the lost low-order bits and dramatically reduces the error in many cancellation-prone scenarios, with error often bounded essentially by a constant multiple of $u$ independent of $n$.\n\nFor benchmarking, we require a baseline for the mathematically exact sum $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i$. Since the test sequences are expressed as decimal strings with at most $16$ fractional digits, each $r_i$ is exactly representable as a rational number with denominator $D = 10^{16}$. Therefore, if $r_i$ is written as a decimal string, then $r_i \\cdot D$ is an integer, and the exact sum is\n$$\nS \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{D} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(r_i \\cdot D\\right), \\qquad D = 10^{16}.\n$$\nWe can compute the numerator $\\sum_{i=1}^n (r_i \\cdot D)$ exactly using integer arithmetic by parsing each decimal string $r_i$ and multiplying by $D$, and only at the end convert $S$ to a floating-point number for the purpose of computing absolute errors $|S_{\\text{naive}} - S|$ and $|S_{\\text{Kahan}} - S|$.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Implement a generator that iterates over each test sequence in the provided order, yielding floating-point values for the naive and Kahan summations.\n- Implement the naive summation as repeated floating-point addition.\n- Implement the Kahan compensated summation with variables $s$ and $c$ initialized to $0$, and the updates\n  $$\n  y \\leftarrow x - c,\\quad t \\leftarrow s + y,\\quad c \\leftarrow (t - s) - y,\\quad s \\leftarrow t.\n  $$\n- Implement the exact rational baseline by summing integer numerators with denominator $D = 10^{16}$: for each segment $(v, c)$, compute the integer $n_v = v \\cdot D$ exactly and add $c \\cdot n_v$ to the integer accumulator. The exact sum is $S = N / D$ with $N$ the integer total. This is valid for the given test suite because each $v$ has at most $16$ digits after the decimal point, so $v \\cdot D$ is an integer.\n- For each test case, compute the absolute errors $e_n = |S_{\\text{naive}} - S|$ and $e_k = |S_{\\text{Kahan}} - S|$, and the boolean $b = (e_k  e_n)$.\n- Produce the final single-line output as a list of the four triples $[e_n, e_k, b]$ for the four specified sequences, in order.\n\nTest suite interpretation:\n1. Sequence $1$: $\\left(\"1.0\",\\, 1\\right)$, $\\left(\"1e-16\",\\, 1000000\\right)$, $\\left(\"-1.0\",\\, 1\\right)$. Here $S = 10^6 \\cdot 10^{-16} = 10^{-10}$. Naive summation will often lose each $10^{-16}$ when added to $1.0$, yielding a result close to $0$ after the final $-1.0$, while Kahan summation recovers the low-order bits in $c$, yielding a result close to $10^{-10}$.\n2. Sequence $2$: $\\left(\"1e-8\",\\, 100000\\right)$, $\\left(\"-1e-8\",\\, 99999\\right)$. Here $S = 10^{-8}$. Both methods should perform well; the absolute errors are expected to be very small compared to $S$.\n3. Sequence $3$: $\\left(\"0.0\",\\, 50000\\right)$. Here $S = 0$. Both methods should yield exactly $0$ in floating-point arithmetic, resulting in zero absolute errors.\n4. Sequence $4$: $\\left(\"1e-16\",\\, 300000\\right)$, $\\left(\"1.0\",\\, 1\\right)$, $\\left(\"-1.0\",\\, 1\\right)$, $\\left(\"1e-16\",\\, 300000\\right)$, $\\left(\"-1e-16\",\\, 600000\\right)$. Here $S = 0$. The long run of tiny terms interspersed with large cancellation stresses both methods; the compensated method reduces the accumulation of round-off.\n\nThe program must implement these steps and print a single line in the exact format:\n$$\n\\left[\\,[e_{n,1},e_{k,1},b_1],\\,[e_{n,2},e_{k,2},b_2],\\,[e_{n,3},e_{k,3},b_3],\\,[e_{n,4},e_{k,4},b_4]\\,\\right].\n$$",
