This first practice problem focuses on the core statement of the Singleton bound, which establishes an essential trade-off between a code's size, length, and error-correcting capability. By calculating the maximum number of codewords for different alphabet sizes , you will develop a concrete feel for how this fundamental limit behaves and how the choice of alphabet, $q$, dramatically influences a code's capacity.",

            "problem": "A team of engineers is designing a simple communication protocol for a fleet of autonomous rovers exploring a remote planet. To ensure data integrity, they employ an error-correcting code. Each message is encoded into a codeword of a fixed length $n$. The symbols used to construct these codewords are drawn from an alphabet of size $q$. A key feature of their code is its minimum distance, $d$, defined as the smallest number of positions in which any two distinct codewords differ. This distance determines the code's error-detection and correction capabilities.\n\nFor this specific protocol, the codeword length is set to $n=6$. To handle anticipated channel noise, the code is required to have a minimum distance of at least $d=4$. The engineers want to understand how the choice of alphabet size impacts the maximum number of unique messages (and thus, unique codewords), $M$, that the system can support.\n\nCalculate the theoretical upper limit for the number of codewords, $M$, under these constraints for three different alphabets: a binary alphabet ($q=2$), a quaternary alphabet ($q=4$), and an octal alphabet ($q=8$). Present the three results as a set of numbers corresponding to the cases $q=2$, $q=4$, and $q=8$, in that order.",
            "solution": "We are given a $q$-ary block code of length $n=6$ with minimum distance at least $d=4$. We seek a theoretical upper limit on the number of codewords $M$ for three values of $q$.\n\nWe use the Singleton bound, which states that for any $q$-ary code of length $n$, size $M$, and minimum distance $d$, one has\n$$\nM \\leq q^{n - d + 1}.\n$$\nDerivation: Deleting (puncturing) any $d - 1$ coordinates from all codewords cannot map two distinct codewords to the same sequence, because any two distinct codewords differ in at least $d$ positions and therefore still differ in at least $d - (d - 1) = 1$ position after puncturing. Hence, all $M$ codewords map injectively into $q$-ary sequences of length $n - (d - 1) = n - d + 1$, of which there are exactly $q^{n - d + 1}$. Therefore, $M \\leq q^{n - d + 1}$.\n\nWith $n=6$ and the requirement $d \\geq 4$, taking $d=4$ gives the loosest (largest) upper bound consistent with the constraint, hence\n$$\nM \\leq q^{6 - 4 + 1} = q^{3}.\n$$\n\nEvaluating for the requested alphabets:\n- For $q=2$: $M \\leq 2^{3} = 8$.\n- For $q=4$: $M \\leq 4^{3} = 64$.\n- For $q=8$: $M \\leq 8^{3} = 512$.\n\nThus the theoretical upper limits are $8$, $64$, and $512$, respectively.",

            "problem": "In coding theory, a code is a set of sequences (codewords) used for transmitting information. A binary code uses an alphabet of size $q=2$ (the symbols 0 and 1). A code is characterized by three main parameters: its length $n$ (the number of symbols in a codeword), its size $M$ (the number of distinct codewords), and its minimum distance $d$ (the minimum number of positions in which any two distinct codewords differ).\n\nThe Singleton bound provides an upper limit on the size of any code with given length and minimum distance: $M \\le q^{n-d+1}$. A code that meets this bound with equality, i.e., for which $M = q^{n-d+1}$, is called a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code.\n\nConsider a simple binary repetition code of length $n \\ge 2$. This code consists of only two codewords: one codeword is a sequence of $n$ zeros, and the other is a sequence of $n$ ones.

The Hamming distance between $0^{n}$ and $1^{n}$ is the number of coordinates in which they differ; since they differ in every coordinate, the minimum distance is $d=n$.\n\nThe Singleton bound states that for an alphabet of size $q$, any code with length $n$, size $M$, and minimum distance $d$ satisfies\n$$\nM \\le q^{n-d+1}.\n$$\nFor the binary case, $q=2$. Substituting $q=2$ and $d=n$ yields\n$$\nM \\le 2^{n-n+1} = 2^{1} = 2.\n$$\nSince the code has $M=2$, it meets the bound with equality:\n$$\nM = 2 = 2^{n-d+1}.\n$$\nTherefore, by the given definition, it is an MDS code.

            "problem": "A research group is developing a linear error-correcting code $C$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$. The code is defined by its $k \\times n$ generator matrix $G$. For a particular application requiring exceptional robustness against data loss in any position, the design specifies a crucial property: any $k$ columns of the generator matrix $G$ must form a linearly independent set. This property ensures that any $k$ coordinate positions of a codeword can serve as an information set for systematic encoding.\n\nThe group constructs a specific reference code, denoted $C_{ref}$, over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$ (the field of integers modulo 19). This reference code has dimension $k=5$ and length $n=19$. The generator matrix $G_{ref}$ is a $5 \\times 19$ matrix whose $j$-th column vector, $\\mathbf{g}_j$ (for $j=1, \\dots, 19$), is constructed using a distinct field element $x_j \\in \\mathbb{F}_{19}$. Specifically, the set $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{19}\\}$ comprises all 19 distinct elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$. The columns are defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{g}_j = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ x_j \\\\ x_j^2 \\\\ x_j^3 \\\\ x_j^4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIt has been verified that this constructed generator matrix $G_{ref}$ indeed satisfies the crucial property that any 5 of its columns are linearly independent.\n\nA competitor makes a bold claim: they have designed a different linear code, $C_{new}$, which also has length $n=19$ and dimension $k=5$ over the same field $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$. The competitor claims their code $C_{new}$ has a minimum Hamming distance $d_{new}$ that is strictly greater than the minimum Hamming distance $d_{ref}$ of the reference code $C_{ref}$.\n\nEvaluate the competitor's claim. Is it possible for such a code $C_{new}$ to exist?\n\nSelect the correct statement:\nA. Yes, such a code $C_{new}$ can exist, but it would require a much more complex generator matrix.\n\nB. Yes, such a code $C_{new}$ can exist, and constructions for them are well-known.\n\nC. No, the existence of such a code $C_{new}$ is impossible.\n\nD. The claim cannot be evaluated without knowing the explicit generator matrix for $C_{new}$.\n\nE. The claim can only be true if $C_{new}$ is a non-linear code.",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate the possibility of a linear code $C_{new}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$ with parameters $[n=19, k=5]$ having a minimum distance $d_{new}$ that is strictly greater than the minimum distance $d_{ref}$ of a given reference code $C_{ref}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the reference code $C_{ref}$. It is a linear code with parameters $[n=19, k=5]$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$. The problem states a key property of its generator matrix $G_{ref}$: any $k=5$ columns are linearly independent.\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in coding theory that relates this property of a generator matrix to the minimum distance of the code. The theorem states that for a linear $[n, k]_q$ code, any $k$ columns of its generator matrix are linearly independent if and only if the code is a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code.\n\nAn MDS code is a code that achieves the Singleton bound with equality. The Singleton bound is an upper bound on the minimum distance $d$ of any code with $M$ codewords of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $q$. The bound is $M \\le q^{n-d+1}$. For a linear $[n, k]_q$ code, the number of codewords is $M=q^k$. Substituting this into the Singleton bound gives $q^k \\le q^{n-d+1}$, which simplifies to $k \\le n-d+1$, or rearranged, $d \\le n - k + 1$.\n\nA code is defined as an MDS code if its minimum distance $d$ is exactly equal to this upper bound:\n$$d = n - k + 1$$\n\nSince the code $C_{ref}$ has the property that any $k=5$ of its columns are linearly independent, it must be an MDS code. We can therefore calculate its minimum distance, $d_{ref}$, using the MDS condition.\nGiven $n=19$ and $k=5$ for $C_{ref}$:\n$$d_{ref} = n - k + 1 = 19 - 5 + 1 = 15$$\nSo, the minimum distance of the reference code is exactly 15. The construction of the generator matrix $G_{ref}$ using columns from a Vandermonde matrix ensures this property, as any $k \\times k$ submatrix formed from distinct evaluation points is a Vandermonde matrix, which is invertible.\n\nNow, let's consider the competitor's claim. They claim to have a linear code $C_{new}$ with parameters $[n=19, k=5]_{19}$ and a minimum distance $d_{new}$ such that $d_{new} > d_{ref}$. This means they are claiming $d_{new} > 15$.\n\nHowever, the Singleton bound $d \\le n - k + 1$ applies to *any* linear code with parameters $[n, k]_q$. For the code $C_{new}$, this bound must also hold. Let's apply the bound to $C_{new}$:\n$$d_{new} \\le n - k + 1$$\n$$d_{new} \\le 19 - 5 + 1$$\n$$d_{new} \\le 15$$\n\nThe Singleton bound dictates that the minimum distance of any linear $[19, 5]$ code cannot exceed 15. The competitor's claim is that they have a code with $d_{new} > 15$. This is a direct contradiction of a fundamental limit in coding theory.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible for such a linear code $C_{new}$ to exist. The reference code $C_{ref}$ is already optimal with respect to minimum distance for its given length and dimension; no linear code can be \"better\" in this regard.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA. Incorrect. No generator matrix, no matter how complex, can create a code that violates the Singleton bound.\nB. Incorrect for the same reason as A.\nC. Correct. The existence of such a code is impossible as it would violate the Singleton bound.\nD. Incorrect. The evaluation does not depend on the specific structure of $C_{new}$, but only on its parameters $(n, k)$ and the fundamental bounds that govern them.\nE. The problem specifies that $C_{new}$ is a linear code. While this option discusses non-linear codes, it is irrelevant to evaluating the claim about the linear code $C_{new}$. The premise of the question is about a linear code.\n\nThe conclusion is that the competitor's claim is false.",
