This standard form is not just a mathematical convenience; it transparently embeds the original message within the first $k$ bits of the codeword, making the structure of the code explicit. This exercise provides hands-on practice in using elementary row operations to achieve this systematic representation, a fundamental skill for analyzing and implementing linear codes. ",

            "problem": "In digital communication, linear block codes are used to encode messages by adding redundant bits, which allows for error detection and correction at the receiver. A linear block code is defined by its generator matrix, $G$. An $(n, k)$ code takes a $k$-bit message vector and produces an $n$-bit codeword. The generator matrix $G$ for such a code is a $k \\times n$ matrix.\n\nAny generator matrix can be converted into an equivalent systematic form, $G_{sys} = [I_k | P]$, where $I_k$ is the $k \\times k$ identity matrix and $P$ is a $k \\times (n-k)$ matrix known as the parity-check part. In this form, the first $k$ bits of the codeword are identical to the original message bits. All arithmetic operations are performed over the binary field $GF(2)$, where addition corresponds to the XOR operation ($1+1=0$).\n\nConsider a specific $(4, 2)$ linear block code described by the following non-systematic generator matrix:\n$$\nG = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nDetermine the parity-check matrix $P$ for the equivalent systematic generator matrix of this code.

Express your answer as a binary row vector of the form $(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6, b_7)$.",
            "solution": "Let the code be a linear $(n,k)$ block code with parity-check matrix $H$. The length of the codewords is $n=7$, and the number of parity bits is $m=3$. All operations are in $GF(2)$.\n\nThe syndrome $s$ for a received vector $r$ is given by $s = rH^T$. If the transmitted codeword was $c$ and the error pattern is $e$, then the received vector is $r = c + e$. The syndrome is then:\n$$\ns = (c+e)H^T = cH^T + eH^T\n$$\nFor any valid codeword $c$, by definition, $cH^T = 0$. Therefore, the syndrome only depends on the error pattern:\n$$\ns = eH^T\n$$\nThe problem states that the all-zero codeword was transmitted, so $c = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$. This means the received vector $r$ is identical to the error pattern $e$, i.e., $r=e$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the target syndrome. This is the syndrome corresponding to a single-bit error in the first position. Let this error pattern be $e_1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$. The syndrome $s_1$ is:\n$$\ns_1 = e_1 H^T\n$$\nThis operation effectively selects the first row of $H^T$. The transpose of $H$ is:\n$$\nH^T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first row of $H^T$ is $(1, 1, 0)$. Thus, the target syndrome is $s_1 = (1, 1, 0)$.\n\nNext, we need to find a received vector $r$ with a Hamming weight of two, $w(r)=2$, that produces this same syndrome. Since we've established $r=e$, we are looking for an error pattern $e$ with $w(e)=2$. An error pattern of weight two means that exactly two bits were flipped. Let the errors be in positions $i$ and $j$, where $i \\neq j$. The error pattern can be written as $e = e_i + e_j$, where $e_k$ is a vector with a 1 in the $k$-th position and 0s elsewhere.\n\nThe syndrome of this error pattern $e$ is:\n$$\ns_e = eH^T = (e_i + e_j)H^T = e_iH^T + e_jH^T\n$$\nThe term $e_k H^T$ corresponds to the $k$-th row of $H^T$, which is also the $k$-th column of $H$. Let's denote the $k$-th column of $H$ as $h_k$. Then, $s_e = h_i + h_j$.\n\nWe are looking for indices $i$ and $j$ such that $s_e = s_1$, which means:\n$$\nh_i + h_j = h_1\n$$\nLet's list the columns of $H$:\n$h_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_6 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $h_7 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe need to find a pair of distinct columns $(h_i, h_j)$ that sum up to $h_1 = (1, 1, 0)^T$. Let's systematically test pairs of columns.\nLet's try summing $h_2$ with other columns:\n$h_2 + h_3 = (0,1,1)^T + (1,1,1)^T = (1,0,0)^T = h_5$. This is not $h_1$.\n$h_2 + h_4 = (0,1,1)^T + (1,0,1)^T = (1,1,0)^T$. This is equal to $h_1$.\n\nSo, we have found a valid pair of indices: $i=2$ and $j=4$. The corresponding error pattern $e$ has errors in the 2nd and 4th positions.\n$$\ne = e_2 + e_4 = (0,1,0,0,0,0,0) + (0,0,0,1,0,0,0) = (0,1,0,1,0,0,0)\n$$\nThe Hamming weight of this vector is $w(e)=2$, which satisfies the condition. Since the all-zero codeword was sent, this error pattern is the received vector, $r=e$.\n\nTherefore, a possible received vector is $r = (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\nFor completeness, we can check for other solutions. For example:\n$h_3 + h_7 = (1,1,1)^T + (0,0,1)^T = (1,1,0)^T = h_1$.\nThis gives another valid error pattern $e' = e_3 + e_7 = (0,0,1,0,0,0,1)$. This is also a valid answer.\nSince the problem asks for only one such vector, we can provide the first one we found.",
