Such a code is defined by a set of codewords, which are vectors of a certain length $n$ over a finite field. For a binary linear code, the elements of the vectors are either 0 or 1, and all arithmetic operations are performed modulo 2.\n\nThe set of all codewords, denoted by $C$, can be generated using a $k \\times n$ matrix $G$ called the generator matrix. Any codeword $c$ in $C$ is obtained by the matrix multiplication $c = uG$, where $u$ is a message vector of length $k$. The set of all message vectors consists of all possible binary vectors of length $k$.\n\nConsider a binary linear code generated by the matrix:\n$$ G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1  1 \\\\ 0  1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe minimum distance, $d_{min}$, of a linear code is a crucial parameter that determines its error-correcting capability.

You will calculate the minimum distance for both a primary code $C$ and its dual code $C^{\\perp}$, uncovering the deep connection between them. This exercise demonstrates the beautiful symmetry where the generator matrix of a code functions as the parity-check matrix for its dual, linking their properties in a direct and practical way .",

            "problem": "A binary linear code is a vector subspace of $\\mathbb{F}_2^n$, where $n$ is the length of the code. A code is often characterized by the triplet $[n, k, d]$, where $n$ is its length, $k$ is its dimension, and $d$ is its minimum Hamming distance.\n\nConsider a $[5, 2]$ binary linear code $C$ specified by the following generator matrix:\n$$\nG_C = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1  0  1  0 \\\\\n0  1  1  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEvery linear code $C$ has an associated dual code, denoted $C^{\\perp}$. The dual code consists of all vectors in $\\mathbb{F}_2^5$ that are orthogonal to every codeword in $C$ (where the dot product is computed modulo 2). The dual code $C^{\\perp}$ is also a linear code with its own parameters, which can be expressed as $[n, n-k, d^{\\perp}]$.\n\nDetermine the minimum distance of the original code, $d(C)$, and the minimum distance of its dual code, $d(C^{\\perp})$. Present your answer as an ordered pair $(d(C), d(C^{\\perp}))$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities: the minimum distance of the code $C$, denoted $d(C)$, and the minimum distance of its dual code, $d(C^{\\perp})$. We will calculate each one separately.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum distance $d(C)$ of the original code $C$. For a linear code, the minimum distance is equal to the minimum Hamming weight of its non-zero codewords. The codewords of $C$ are all possible linear combinations (over $\\mathbb{F}_2$) of the rows of its generator matrix $G_C$. The rows of $G_C$ are $r_1 = (1, 1, 0, 1, 0)$ and $r_2 = (0, 1, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\nThe code $C$ is a $[5, 2]$ code, so it has dimension $k=2$. This means there are $2^k = 2^2 = 4$ codewords in total. We list them and find their Hamming weights (the number of non-zero elements).\nThe zero codeword is $0 \\cdot r_1 + 0 \\cdot r_2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$, which has a weight of 0.\nThe non-zero codewords are:\n1. $c_1 = 1 \\cdot r_1 + 0 \\cdot r_2 = r_1 = (1, 1, 0, 1, 0)$. The Hamming weight is $w(c_1) = 3$.\n2. $c_2 = 0 \\cdot r_1 + 1 \\cdot r_2 = r_2 = (0, 1, 1, 0, 1)$. The Hamming weight is $w(c_2) = 3$.\n3. $c_3 = 1 \\cdot r_1 + 1 \\cdot r_2 = r_1 + r_2 = (1+0, 1+1, 0+1, 1+0, 0+1) = (1, 0, 1, 1, 1)$. The Hamming weight is $w(c_3) = 4$.\n\nThe set of Hamming weights of the non-zero codewords is $\\{3, 3, 4\\}$. The minimum value in this set is 3.\nTherefore, the minimum distance of code $C$ is $d(C) = 3$.\n\nNext, we determine the minimum distance $d(C^{\\perp})$ of the dual code $C^{\\perp}$.\nA fundamental property relating a code and its dual is that the generator matrix of a code $C$ serves as a parity-check matrix for its dual code $C^{\\perp}$. Let's denote the parity-check matrix of $C^{\\perp}$ by $H_{\\perp}$. Then, we have:\n$$\nH_{\\perp} = G_C = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1  0  1  0 \\\\\n0  1  1  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAnother key theorem in coding theory states that the minimum distance of a linear code is the smallest integer $d$ such that there exist $d$ linearly dependent columns in its parity-check matrix. We apply this theorem to the code $C^{\\perp}$ using its parity-check matrix $H_{\\perp}$.\n\nLet the columns of $H_{\\perp}$ be $h_1, h_2, h_3, h_4, h_5$:\n$$\nh_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad h_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad h_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad h_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad h_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe need to find the smallest number of these column vectors that sum to the zero vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- **Size 1:** Is any single column the zero vector? No. So, $d(C^{\\perp}) > 1$.\n- **Size 2:** Does there exist a pair of columns $\\{h_i, h_j\\}$ with $i \\neq j$ such that $h_i + h_j = \\mathbf{0}$? This is equivalent to $h_i = h_j$ since we are in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nBy inspection, we can see that $h_1 = h_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Thus, $h_1 + h_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a linear dependency of size 2.\nWe also see that $h_3 = h_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $h_3 + h_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is another linear dependency of size 2.\n\nSince we have found a set of 2 linearly dependent columns, and we have already established that the minimum size of such a set must be greater than 1, the smallest number of linearly dependent columns is 2.\nTherefore, the minimum distance of the dual code $C^{\\perp}$ is $d(C^{\\perp}) = 2$.\n\nCombining our results, the ordered pair is $(d(C), d(C^{\\perp})) = (3, 2)$.",
