            "introduction": "This practice explores a fundamental concept from communication theory: measuring the information content of a signal corrupted by noise. By calculating the joint differential entropy of the original signal $X$ and the received signal $S = X+N$, we can quantify the total uncertainty in the system. This exercise is a perfect opportunity to apply the chain rule for differential entropy and leverage its key properties, such as invariance to translation, to arrive at an elegant solution .",

            "problem": "Consider a simple communication system model. A continuous random variable $X$, representing a signal, is uniformly distributed over the interval $[0, a]$, where $a$ is a positive constant. This signal is transmitted through a channel that introduces additive noise. The noise is represented by a random variable $N$, which follows a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of $\\sigma^2$. The signal $X$ and the noise $N$ are statistically independent. The received signal is given by the sum $S = X + N$.\n\nDetermine the joint differential entropy, denoted as $h(X, S)$, of the signal $X$ and the received signal $S$.

            "problem": "Consider two independent random variables, $X$ and $Y$, both following a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 1]$. Let us define two new random variables, $U$ and $V$, as the minimum and maximum of $X$ and $Y$, respectively. That is, $U = \\min(X, Y)$ and $V = \\max(X, Y)$.\n\nThe joint differential entropy of two continuous random variables $U$ and $V$ with a joint probability density function (PDF) $f_{U,V}(u,v)$ is defined as:\n$$h(U, V) = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_{U,V}(u,v) \\ln(f_{U,V}(u,v)) \\,du\\,dv$$\nwhere the integration is performed over the support of the distribution.\n\nCalculate the value of the joint differential entropy $h(U, V)$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression.",
            "solution": "Our goal is to compute the joint differential entropy $h(U, V)$ for $U = \\min(X, Y)$ and $V = \\max(X, Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$.\n\nFirst, we must find the joint probability density function (PDF) of the random variables $U$ and $V$, denoted as $f_{U,V}(u,v)$. The random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent and uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, so their joint PDF is $f_{X,Y}(x,y) = 1$ for $(x,y) \\in [0,1] \\times [0,1]$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe transformation from $(X, Y)$ to $(U, V)$ maps a point in the $xy$-plane to a point in the $uv$-plane. Since $X$ and $Y$ are in $[0,1]$, their minimum $U$ and maximum $V$ must also be in $[0,1]$. Furthermore, by definition, the minimum cannot be greater than the maximum, so we must have $U \\le V$. Therefore, the support of the joint distribution of $(U,V)$ is the triangular region $\\mathcal{R} = \\{(u,v) | 0 \\le u \\le v \\le 1\\}$.\n\nNow, let's find the PDF $f_{U,V}(u,v)$ on this support region using the method of transformation of random variables. The transformation $(x,y) \\to (u,v)$ is not one-to-one. For any pair $(u, v)$ in the support region with $u < v$, there are two points in the $(X,Y)$ space that map to it: $(X,Y)=(u,v)$ and $(X,Y)=(v,u)$.\n\nThe general formula for the PDF of transformed variables for a many-to-one mapping is given by a sum over all pre-images:\n$$f_{U,V}(u,v) = \\sum_{i} f_{X,Y}(x_i, y_i) |\\det(J_i)|$$\nwhere $(x_i, y_i)$ are the pre-images of $(u,v)$ and $J_i$ is the Jacobian of the $i$-th inverse transformation.\n\nThe two inverse transformations are:\n1. $T_1^{-1}: (u,v) \\to (x,y) = (u,v)$. This corresponds to the case $X=U, Y=V$, which happens when $X \\le Y$. The Jacobian of this inverse transformation is $J_1 = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v} \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1$.\n2. $T_2^{-1}: (u,v) \\to (x,y) = (v,u)$. This corresponds to the case $Y=U, X=V$, which happens when $Y < X$. The Jacobian of this inverse transformation is $J_2 = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v} \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -1$.\n\nFor any point $(u,v)$ in the support region $\\mathcal{R}$, both pre-images $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ are in the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$. Thus, $f_{X,Y}(u,v) = 1$ and $f_{X,Y}(v,u) = 1$.\nApplying the formula, we get:\n$$f_{U,V}(u,v) = f_{X,Y}(u,v) |\\det(J_1)| + f_{X,Y}(v,u) |\\det(J_2)| = 1 \\cdot |1| + 1 \\cdot |-1| = 1 + 1 = 2$$\nSo, the joint PDF is $f_{U,V}(u,v) = 2$ for $(u,v) \\in \\mathcal{R}$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nLet's verify this is a valid PDF by integrating over the support $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathcal{R}} f_{U,V}(u,v) \\,du\\,dv = \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{v} 2 \\,du\\,dv = \\int_{0}^{1} [2u]_{u=0}^{u=v} \\,dv = \\int_{0}^{1} 2v \\,dv = [v^2]_{v=0}^{v=1} = 1 $$\nThe PDF is valid.\n\nNow we can calculate the joint differential entropy using the provided formula:\n$$h(U, V) = -\\int_{\\mathcal{R}} f_{U,V}(u,v) \\ln(f_{U,V}(u,v)) \\,du\\,dv$$\nSince $f_{U,V}(u,v) = 2$ on the support region $\\mathcal{R}$, the term $\\ln(f_{U,V}(u,v))$ is simply $\\ln(2)$, which is a constant.\n$$h(U, V) = -\\int_{\\mathcal{R}} 2 \\ln(2) \\,du\\,dv$$\nWe can pull the constant term $-2\\ln(2)$ out of the integral:\n$$h(U, V) = -2\\ln(2) \\int_{\\mathcal{R}} 1 \\,du\\,dv$$\nThe integral $\\int_{\\mathcal{R}} 1 \\,du\\,dv$ is simply the area of the support region $\\mathcal{R}$. The region $\\mathcal{R} = \\{(u,v) | 0 \\le u \\le v \\le 1\\}$ is a triangle in the $uv$-plane with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,1)$. The area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore,\n$$h(U, V) = -2\\ln(2) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = -\\ln(2)$$\nAlternatively, since the joint distribution of $(U,V)$ is uniform over the region $\\mathcal{R}$, its differential entropy is given by the logarithm of the volume (in this case, area) of the support region. The area of $\\mathcal{R}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the entropy is $h(U,V) = \\ln(\\text{Area}(\\mathcal{R})) = \\ln(\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\ln(2)$.",
