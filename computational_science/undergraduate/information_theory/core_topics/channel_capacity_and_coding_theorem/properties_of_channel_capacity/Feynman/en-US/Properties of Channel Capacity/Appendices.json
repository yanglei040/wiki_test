            "introduction": "To build our intuition for channel capacity, we begin with a simplified, ideal scenario: a deterministic channel. In this type of channel, there is no noise or uncertainty in the transmission; each input maps to a specific output. This exercise  challenges you to find the capacity of such a channel, forcing you to focus purely on how the structure of the input-to-output mapping limits the information throughput. The key insight lies in understanding that capacity here is equivalent to maximizing the entropy, or variety, of the possible outputs.",

            "problem": "A simple digital processing unit is designed to operate on a limited set of integer inputs. The unit accepts one of four possible input signals, represented by the integers in the set $\\mathcal{X} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. It performs a fixed computation and produces an output integer from the set $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The relationship between any input $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ and the corresponding output $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ is governed by the deterministic function $y = x \\pmod 3$, where the result of the modulo operation is the non-negative remainder of the division of $x$ by 3.\n\nAssuming each use of this processing unit represents a single use of a communication channel, determine the capacity of this channel. Express your answer as a single analytic expression in units of bits per channel use. Use the base-2 logarithm in your calculations.",
            "solution": "Let $X \\in \\mathcal{X}=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and $Y \\in \\mathcal{Y}=\\{0,1,2\\}$ with the deterministic mapping $Y=f(X)=X \\bmod 3$. For a deterministic channel, the conditional entropy satisfies $H(Y|X)=0$. Therefore, the mutual information for an input distribution $P_{X}$ is\n$$\nI(X;Y)=H(Y)-H(Y|X)=H(Y).\n$$\nThe channel capacity is the maximum mutual information over all input distributions, hence\n$$\nC=\\max_{P_{X}} I(X;Y)=\\max_{P_{X}} H(Y).\n$$\nThe mapping groups inputs by their remainders: $1 \\mapsto 1$, $2 \\mapsto 2$, $3 \\mapsto 0$, $4 \\mapsto 1$. Thus, for any input distribution $P_{X}$, the induced output distribution satisfies\n$$\nP_{Y}(0)=P_{X}(3), \\quad P_{Y}(1)=P_{X}(1)+P_{X}(4), \\quad P_{Y}(2)=P_{X}(2).\n$$\nGiven any desired output distribution $(p_{0},p_{1},p_{2})$ with $p_{0}+p_{1}+p_{2}=1$ and $p_{i}\\geq 0$, one can choose, for example,\n$$\nP_{X}(3)=p_{0}, \\quad P_{X}(2)=p_{2}, \\quad P_{X}(1)=p_{1}, \\quad P_{X}(4)=0,\n$$\nwhich induces $P_{Y}=p$. Hence every distribution on $\\{0,1,2\\}$ is achievable, and the capacity reduces to the maximum entropy over a 3-point alphabet. The maximum of $H(Y)$ occurs at the uniform distribution, giving\n$$\n\\max_{P_{Y}} H(Y)=\\log_{2}(3).\n$$\nTherefore, the channel capacity is\n$$\nC=\\log_{2}(3) \\text{ bits per channel use.}\n$$",

            "introduction": "Real-world channels are rarely perfect. This next practice introduces the crucial element of noise by presenting a descriptive scenario of a communication channel that sometimes transmits correctly and sometimes injects random errors .

The channel's behavior is probabilistic and defined as follows: for any given input bit $X$, the output bit $Y$ is identical to the input (i.e., $Y=X$) with a probability of $1/2$. With the remaining probability of $1/2$, the channel disregards the input and the output $Y$ is determined by a random fair coin flip, meaning $Y$ is set to $0$ or $1$ with equal probability, irrespective of the input $X$.\n\nCalculate the capacity of this channel.

            "introduction": "Our final practice moves beyond counting 'bits per channel use' to a more practical metric: information rate measured in bits per unit time. We return to a noiseless channel, but now with a new physical constraint: different symbols take different amounts of time to transmit .
