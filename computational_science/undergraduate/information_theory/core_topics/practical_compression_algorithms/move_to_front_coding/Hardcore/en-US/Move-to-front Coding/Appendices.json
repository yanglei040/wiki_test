The process involves generating a sequence of costs, which are the 1-indexed positions of symbols, and then dynamically updating the symbol list. This first practice  provides direct experience with this step-by-step procedure, which is the cornerstone for understanding how MTF adapts to patterns in data.",

            "problem": "The Move-to-Front (MTF) algorithm is a dynamic list-based encoding scheme used in data compression. It maintains an ordered list of symbols in the alphabet. To encode a symbol from an input sequence, the algorithm performs the following steps:\n1.  Locate the symbol in the current list and record its 1-indexed position (the \"cost\" of encoding).\n2.  Transmit this position as the encoded output.\n3.  Move the just-encoded symbol to the very front of the list, shifting other symbols back as necessary to fill the gap.\n\nConsider an alphabet consisting of the unique characters from the word `STATISTICS`. An MTF encoder is initialized with a list of these characters sorted alphabetically: `(A, C, I, S, T)`.\n\nYour task is to determine the sequence of integer costs that the MTF encoder generates when processing the input sequence `STATISTICS`.

Its effectiveness lies in its ability to assign low encoding costs to symbols that exhibit locality of reference—that is, symbols that appear frequently or in close succession.

When a symbol needs to be encoded, its current position (index) in the list is recorded, and the symbol is then moved to the front of the list. The positions are 1-indexed, meaning the first symbol in the list is at position 1.\n\nConsider an alphabet consisting of four symbols: $\\Sigma = \\{A, B, C, D\\}$.

Your goal is to find a sequence of input symbols which, when processed sequentially by the MTF algorithm, transforms the list into the complete reverse of its initial order, that is, $L_{final} = (D, C, B, A)$.\n\nWhat is the shortest such sequence of symbols?\n\nA.

For $A$ to be last in $L_{f}$, it must end up behind $B$, $C$, and $D$. Starting from position $1$, $A$ can only be pushed back by moves that bring other symbols to the front; each such move can increase the index of $A$ by at most $1$. Therefore, at least three move-to-front operations on symbols from $\\{B,C,D\\}$ are required to push $A$ from position $1$ to position $4$. Hence, any such sequence must have length at least $3$.\n\nNow we exhibit a sequence of length $3$ that achieves the target:\n- Process $B$: \n$$L_{1}=(B,A,C,D).$$\n- Process $C$:\n$$L_{2}=(C,B,A,D).$$\n- Process $D$:\n$$L_{3}=(D,C,B,A).$$\nThus $L_{3}=L_{f}$.\n\nSince a sequence of length $3$ exists and no sequence of length less than $3$ can work, the shortest sequence is $BCD$, which corresponds to option C.",
