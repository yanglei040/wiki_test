This first exercise  guides you through the step-by-step process of converting an integer into its corresponding Rice code, a special case of Golomb coding where the parameter $M$ is a power of two. By calculating the quotient and remainder, then generating their respective unary and binary codes, you will build a solid foundation for more advanced applications.",

            "problem": "A new lossless data compression scheme, part of a hypothetical \"Simple Archival Format (SAF),\" utilizes Golomb coding to efficiently represent streams of non-negative integers. The encoding for a non-negative integer $x$ depends on a tunable positive integer parameter $M$.\n\nThe encoding process is as follows:\n1.  The integer $x$ is divided by the parameter $M$ to produce a quotient $q = \\lfloor x/M \\rfloor$ and a remainder $r = x \\pmod M$.\n2.  The quotient $q$ is encoded in unary representation, defined as a sequence of $q$ ones followed by a single zero. For example, $q=3$ is encoded as `1110`.\n3.  The remainder $r$ is encoded in binary. When the parameter $M$ is a power of two, such that $M = 2^k$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$, the remainder $r$ is encoded as a standard $k$-bit unsigned binary number. For example, if $k=3$ and the remainder is $r=5$, its binary code is `101`.\n4.  The final codeword is the concatenation of the unary code for the quotient and the binary code for the remainder.\n\nYour task is to determine the Golomb codeword for the integer $x = 9$ using the parameter $M = 4$.

            "introduction": "The ability to encode data is only useful if it can be faithfully decoded. This practice  challenges you to reverse the process, starting from a bitstream and recovering the original integer. This exercise demonstrates the decoding of a general Golomb code and highlights the crucial skill of parsing the bitstream to separate the unary-coded quotient from the binary-coded remainder. It's important to note how this hypothetical example defines the unary code, reminding us that while the core principles are consistent, specific implementations can have minor variations.",
