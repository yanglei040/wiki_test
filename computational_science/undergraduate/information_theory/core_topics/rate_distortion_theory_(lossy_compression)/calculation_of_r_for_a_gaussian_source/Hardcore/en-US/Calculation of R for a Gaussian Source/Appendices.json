            "introduction": "To begin, let's explore the fundamental trade-off between compression rate and signal quality. For a Gaussian source, this relationship is elegantly captured by the rate-distortion function, $R(D) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log_2(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{D})$, which defines the minimum rate $R$ required to achieve an average distortion $D$. This first exercise provides direct practice in applying this core formula, allowing you to calculate the theoretical data rate needed to meet a specific fidelity requirement, represented by the signal-to-distortion ratio .",

            "problem": "An interplanetary probe sends back data from a sensor measuring the local magnetic field strength. The sensor readings are modeled as samples drawn from a continuous-valued, memoryless Gaussian source with a variance of $\\sigma^2$. To manage the limited communication bandwidth, the data is compressed before transmission. The quality of the compressed signal is measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE), denoted by $D$, between the original and the reconstructed signal upon reception at the ground station. The mission specification requires that the signal-to-distortion ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the source variance to the MSE ($\\sigma^2/D$), must be exactly 64.

            "introduction": "While the rate-distortion function describes the theoretical limit of performance, practical compression systems often operate with some degree of sub-optimality. A crucial engineering task is to quantify how close a real-world system comes to this ideal benchmark. By rearranging the rate-distortion formula to solve for the minimum possible distortion, $D_{\\text{min}} = \\sigma^2 2^{-2R}$, we can establish the best-case performance for any given rate. This problem introduces the concept of the \"distortion gap\"—the difference between the distortion of an actual system and the theoretical minimum—a key metric for evaluating compression efficiency .",
