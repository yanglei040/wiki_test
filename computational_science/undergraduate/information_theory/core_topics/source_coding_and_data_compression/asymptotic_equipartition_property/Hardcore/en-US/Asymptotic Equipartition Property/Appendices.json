The process being monitored is such that the sensor's output can be modeled as a memoryless source where each digit is generated independently.

A sequence $x^n = x_1x_2...x_n$ of length $n$ is considered to be in the typical set $A_{\\epsilon}^{(n)}$ if its sample entropy is close to the true entropy $H(X)$.
