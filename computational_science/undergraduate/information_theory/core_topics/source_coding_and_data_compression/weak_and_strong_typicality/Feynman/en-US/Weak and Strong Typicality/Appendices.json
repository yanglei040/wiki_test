Weak typicality provides our first formal definition of 'representative' sequences by identifying those whose probabilities are close to the expected value, $2^{-nH(X)}$. This exercise  invites you to move beyond the abstract definition by performing a concrete calculation. By identifying which sequences belong to the weakly typical set for a given source and summing their probabilities, you will gain a hands-on understanding of how this set captures the bulk of the probability mass, a foundational insight for data compression.",
