Before we can talk about optimal codes, we must first determine if a code with a given set of lengths can even exist.

A **ternary** system, which uses an alphabet of size $D_B=3$ (e.g., symbols '0', '1', and '2').\n\nTo assess how compactly the chosen set of codeword lengths utilizes the potential of each alphabet, they analyze a quantity $K_D = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} D^{-l_i}$, where $D$ is the alphabet size and $\\{l_i\\}$ are the codeword lengths. A smaller value of $K_D$ indicates a less \"saturated\" code for the given lengths.\n\nCalculate the value of this quantity for the binary system, $K_A$, and for the ternary system, $K_B$.

            "introduction": "A code can satisfy Kraft's inequality and still be inefficient. This final practice moves our focus from mere existence to the concept of optimality. You will explore a critical structural property that all optimal prefix codes must possess, learning to identify codes that are provably sub-optimal for any possible probability distribution. This exercise deepens your understanding of what truly makes a code the most compact representation possible. ",

            "problem": "In the field of data compression, a fundamental goal is to find an optimal prefix code for a given information source. A prefix code is one where no codeword is a prefix of another, and an optimal code is a prefix code that has the minimum possible average codeword length for a given probability distribution of source symbols.\n\nAn engineer is designing a binary prefix code for a data source that produces five distinct symbols. A colleague proposes using a code with codeword lengths given by the set $L = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 5\\}$. The engineer claims that this code can never be optimal. That is, for any possible probability distribution on the five source symbols, there must exist a different prefix code with a strictly smaller average codeword length.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most rigorous and correct justification for the engineer's claim?\n\nA. The set of lengths $L$ does not satisfy the Kraft inequality, which is a necessary condition for the existence of any prefix code.\n\nB. An optimal code must assign shorter codewords to more probable symbols, and a code with repeated lengths like $L$ cannot guarantee this property.\n\nC. The code tree corresponding to these lengths must contain at least one internal node that has only a single child node, a structure that can always be improved to create a code with a smaller average length.\n\nD. For any valid probability distribution, a different prefix code with the set of lengths $L' = \\{2, 2, 3, 4, 4\\}$ can be constructed, and this new code is mathematically guaranteed to result in a lower average codeword length.\n\nE. The sum of the codeword lengths, which is $1+3+4+5+5=18$, is not a power of 2, a required property for optimal binary codes.",
            "solution": "We consider a binary prefix code with codeword lengths $l_{1},\\dots,l_{n}$ and average codeword length $L=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} l_{i}$ for a source with symbol probabilities $p_{1},\\dots,p_{n}$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}=1$ and $p_{i}\\ge 0$. Existence of a prefix code with given lengths requires the Kraft inequality\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{-l_{i}} \\le 1.\n$$\nMoreover, a well-known structural property is that a prefix code is represented by a rooted binary tree whose leaves correspond to codewords, and such a tree is full (every internal node has exactly two children) if and only if the Kraft sum equals $1$. If the Kraft sum is strictly less than $1$, the corresponding tree cannot be full, which implies the existence of at least one internal node with only one child (a unary internal node).\n\nFor the proposed set $L=\\{1,3,4,5,5\\}$, the Kraft sum is\n$$\n2^{-1}+2^{-3}+2^{-4}+2^{-5}+2^{-5}=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1}{32}+\\frac{1}{32}=\\frac{3}{4}1.\n$$\nThus the Kraft inequality is satisfied (so A is false as a justification), but the sum is strictly less than $1$. Therefore, any code tree realizing these lengths cannot be full; it must contain at least one internal node with only a single child.\n\nWe now show why any prefix code whose tree has an internal node with only one child is strictly suboptimal for every probability distribution. Let $v$ be such a unary internal node, let $u$ be its unique child, and let $S$ be the set of leaves in the subtree rooted at $u$. Consider the operation that removes the edge $(v,u)$ and merges $u$ into $v$, thereby shortening every codeword in $S$ by exactly $1$ bit and leaving all other codewords unchanged. The prefix-free property is preserved because the removed edge was traversed by all and only the codewords in $S$, and there are no codewords in the missing sibling subtree of $v$. Denote the new codeword lengths by $l_{i}'$:\n$$\nl_{i}'=\\begin{cases}\nl_{i}-1,  \\text{if the $i$th codeword is in } S,\\\\\nl_{i},  \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nHence the new average length is\n$$\nL'=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} l_{i}'=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} l_{i}-\\sum_{i\\in S} p_{i}=L-\\sum_{i\\in S} p_{i}.\n$$\nBecause the leaves in $S$ correspond to actual source symbols and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}=1$, at least one $p_{i}$ with $i\\in S$ is strictly positive, so\n$$\n\\sum_{i\\in S} p_{i}0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad L'L.\n$$\nTherefore any code with a unary internal node is strictly improvable for every probability distribution, and thus cannot be optimal.\n\nApplying this to $L=\\{1,3,4,5,5\\}$: since the Kraft sum is strictly less than $1$, the corresponding tree must have at least one unary internal node, so it is strictly improvable as above. This provides a rigorous, distribution-independent justification that no code with these lengths can be optimal. This is precisely the content of option C.\n\nFor completeness:\n- A is incorrect because the Kraft inequality is satisfied (strictly).\n- B is not a rigorous justification: repeated lengths do not preclude optimality.\n- D is false because $\\{2,2,3,4,4\\}$ does not uniformly dominate $\\{1,3,4,5,5\\}$ for all distributions; for example, heavily skewed distributions favor a length-$1$ codeword.\n- E is incorrect; optimality is characterized by the Kraft equality $\\sum 2^{-l_{i}}=1$, not by the sum of lengths being a power of $2$.\n\nHence, the most rigorous and correct justification is C.",
