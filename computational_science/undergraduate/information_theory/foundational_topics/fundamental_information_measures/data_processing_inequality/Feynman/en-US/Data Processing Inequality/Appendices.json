This first exercise  grounds this abstract principle in a concrete scenario involving a digital signal passing through two cascaded noisy channels. By analyzing this system, you'll formalize the intuition that each step of processing can only degrade the signal's quality and reduce the information it carries about the original source.",

            "problem": "A binary signal $X$ is drawn from a distribution where $P(X=0) = \\alpha$ and $P(X=1) = 1-\\alpha$, with $0 < \\alpha < 1$. The signal is sent through a cascade of two independent noisy channels. The first channel is a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC), which flips the transmitted bit with a crossover probability of $p_1$, producing an intermediate signal $Y$. This signal $Y$ is then immediately fed as input into a second, independent BSC with a crossover probability of $p_2$, producing the final signal $Z$. Assume that the channels are neither perfect nor completely random, so their crossover probabilities are in the range $0 < p_1 < 1$ and $0 < p_2 < 1$.\n\nLet $I(X; Y)$ denote the mutual information between the source $X$ and the intermediate signal $Y$, and let $I(X; Z)$ denote the mutual information between the source $X$ and the final signal $Z$. All mutual information values are calculated in units of bits. Which of the following relationships is universally true for the described system under the given conditions?\n\nA. $I(X; Z) > I(X; Y)$\n\nB. $I(X; Z) = I(X; Y)$\n\nC. $I(X; Z) < I(X; Y)$\n\nD. $I(X; Z) \\le I(X; Y)$\n\nE. $I(X; Z) \\ge I(X; Y)$",
            "solution": "The problem describes a system where a signal $X$ is processed to create $Y$, which is then further processed to create $Z$. The key insight is to recognize the relationship between the three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.\n\nThe output of the first channel, $Y$, depends only on its input, $X$. The output of the second channel, $Z$, depends only on its input, $Y$. This means that if we know the intermediate signal $Y$, the final signal $Z$ is conditionally independent of the original signal $X$. This structure is known as a Markov chain, which is denoted as $X \\to Y \\to Z$. The joint probability distribution for such a chain factorizes as $p(x, y, z) = p(x) p(y|x) p(z|y)$.\n\nWe can analyze the relationship between $I(X;Y)$ and $I(X;Z)$ using the chain rule for mutual information. The mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y, Z)$ can be expanded in two ways:\n\n1.  $I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)$\n2.  $I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$\n\nFrom the definition of the Markov chain $X \\to Y \\to Z$, we know that $X$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent given $Y$. This property implies that the conditional mutual information $I(X; Z|Y)$ is zero.\n$$I(X; Z|Y) = 0$$\n\nSubstituting this result into the first expansion gives:\n$$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + 0 = I(X; Y)$$\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for $I(X; Y, Z)$:\n$$I(X; Y) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$$\n\nA fundamental property of mutual information is that it is always non-negative. This applies to conditional mutual information as well. Therefore:\n$$I(X; Y|Z) \\ge 0$$\n\nThis term, $I(X; Y|Z)$, represents the remaining uncertainty about $Y$ that is resolved by knowing $X$, even after $Z$ is already known. Intuitively, it is the information \"lost\" in the second channel.\n\nCombining our equation with the non-negativity property, we get:\n$$I(X; Y) \\ge I(X; Z)$$\nor equivalently,\n$$I(X; Z) \\le I(X; Y)$$\n\nThis result is a famous theorem in information theory called the Data Processing Inequality. It states that post-processing of data (in this case, passing $Y$ through the second BSC to get $Z$) cannot increase the mutual information with respect to the original source $X$.\n\nLet's analyze the given options based on this inequality:\n- Option A ($I(X; Z) > I(X; Y)$) and Option E ($I(X; Z) \\ge I(X; Y)$) are incorrect as they contradict the Data Processing Inequality (unless equality holds).\n- Option B ($I(X; Z) = I(X; Y)$) is not always true. Equality holds if and only if $I(X; Y|Z) = 0$. This would mean that $Y$ can be perfectly determined from $Z$. For a BSC with crossover probability $p_2 \\in (0, 1)$, the mapping from $Y$ to $Z$ is not one-to-one, so in general $Y$ cannot be recovered from $Z$ without uncertainty. For example, if $p_1=0.1, p_2=0.1, \\alpha=0.5$, a direct calculation would show a strict inequality.\n- Option C ($I(X; Z) < I(X; Y)$) is also not always true. While it holds for most non-trivial cases, it is possible for equality to occur. For example, if the first channel is such that $I(X; Y) = 0$ (e.g., if $p_1=0.5$ and $\\alpha=0.5$), then since $Z$ is a further processed version of $Y$, we must also have $I(X; Z) = 0$. In this case, $I(X; Z) = I(X; Y) = 0$.\n- Option D ($I(X; Z) \\le I(X; Y)$) is the only relationship that is universally true for any choice of $\\alpha$, $p_1$, and $p_2$ within the specified ranges, as it correctly captures the Data Processing Inequality, including the possibility of equality in specific edge cases.",
