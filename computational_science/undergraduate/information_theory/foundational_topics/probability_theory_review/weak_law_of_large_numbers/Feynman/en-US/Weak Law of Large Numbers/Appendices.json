            "problem": "A team of environmental scientists is deploying a network of low-cost sensors to monitor the concentration of a specific dissolved chemical in a large, stable reservoir. The true concentration of the chemical, denoted by $\\mu$, is unknown but constant throughout the reservoir.\n\nEach sensor, when deployed, provides a single measurement. Let $X_i$ be the measurement from the $i$-th sensor. These measurements are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables. While the sensors are unbiased, meaning the expected value of any measurement is the true concentration ($E[X_i] = \\mu$), they are subject to random error. The quality of these sensors is characterized by the standard deviation of their measurements, which is known to be $\\sigma = 0.5$ parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe team plans to calculate the average of all the sensor readings, $\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, where $n$ is the number of sensors deployed. To ensure the reliability of their findings, the team requires that the absolute difference between their average measurement and the true concentration is no more than $0.02$ ppm.

This is a direct application of the Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN).\n\nThe WLLN states that for a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots$ with a finite expected value $E[Y_i] = \\mu_Y$, their sample mean $\\bar{Y}_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$ converges in probability to $\\mu_Y$.

Condition:** The problem states that the random variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots$ are i.i.d. Since each $Y_i$ is a function of the corresponding $X_i$ (specifically $Y_i = X_i^2$), and the function is the same for all $i$, the sequence of random variables $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots$ is also independent and identically distributed.\n\n2.  **Finite Mean Condition:** The WLLN requires that the expected value of $Y_i$, denoted $E[Y_i]$, is finite. Let's calculate this expectation.\n$$E[Y_i] = E[X_i^2]$$\nWe can relate $E[X_i^2]$ to the given mean and variance of $X_i$. The definition of variance is:\n$$\\text{Var}(X_i) = E[X_i^2] - (E[X_i])^2$$\nWe are given that $\\text{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma^2$ and $E[X_i] = \\mu$. Substituting these values into the variance formula gives:\n$$\\sigma^2 = E[X_i^2] - \\mu^2$$\nSolving for $E[X_i^2]$, we get:\n$$E[X_i^2] = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$$\nSince $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ are given as finite, the expectation $E[Y_i] = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$ is also finite. Let's denote this common mean of the $Y_i$ sequence as $\\mu_Y = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$.\n\nSince both conditions for the WLLN are satisfied for the sequence $Y_i = X_i^2$, we can conclude that their sample mean, $M_n$, converges in probability to their true mean, $\\mu_Y$.\n$$M_n \\xrightarrow{p} E[Y_i] = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$$\n\nThus, the value to which $M_n$ converges in probability is $\\mu^2 + \\sigma^2$.",
