            "introduction": "Landauer's principle is often introduced by considering the full erasure of a bit, leading to the famous energy cost of $k_{B}T \\ln 2$. This foundational exercise  generalizes this concept, demonstrating that any process reducing a system's uncertainty has an associated minimum energy cost. You will calculate the work required to shift a memory bit from a state of maximum uncertainty to one of partial, but not complete, certainty, reinforcing the direct link between the change in Shannon entropy and the necessary thermodynamic work.",

A single bit of information in this device is stored in a two-state physical system, which is maintained in thermal equilibrium with a large heat reservoir at a constant absolute temperature $T$.\n\nInitially, the memory bit is in a state of maximum uncertainty, where the probabilities of it being in the logical '0' state, $p(0)$, and the logical '1' state, $p(1)$, are equal. The system is then subjected to a thermodynamically reversible, isothermal process that changes it to a state of partial certainty. In this final state, the probability of the bit being in the '0' state is $p_{final}(0) = 0.9$, and the probability of it being in the '1' state is $p_{final}(1) = 0.1$.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum theoretical work, $W$, that must be performed on the system to accomplish this change in its informational state.

            "introduction": "The physical size of a memory register does not always correspond to its information content. Strong correlations between a system's components can significantly reduce its state space and, consequently, the energy needed to erase it. This practice problem  explores this subtlety through a hypothetical two-bit register where the bits are perfectly correlated. By calculating the erasure cost, you will discover that it is the amount of logical information being erased, not the number of physical bits, that dictates the fundamental energy limit.",

At any given moment before a reset operation, the cell is found in the '00' state with a probability of 0.5, and in the '11' state with a probability of 0.5.\n\nA \"reset\" operation is defined as a process that reliably forces the memory cell into the '00' state, regardless of its initial state.
