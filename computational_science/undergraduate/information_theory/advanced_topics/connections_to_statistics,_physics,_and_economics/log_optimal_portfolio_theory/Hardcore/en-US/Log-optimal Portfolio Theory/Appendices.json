            "problem": "An investor is building a portfolio by allocating capital among three different speculative assets: $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$. The market has three possible future states, $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$, which occur with respective probabilities $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$. The performance of the assets is described by a matrix of wealth relatives (return factors), $X$, where the element $X_{ij}$ represents the multiplicative return on asset $A_j$ if the market state $S_i$ occurs. For example, if $X_{12} = 1.15$, it means asset $A_2$ yields a 15% gain in state $S_1$.\n\nA portfolio is defined by a vector of weights $\\boldsymbol{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3)$, where $b_j$ is the fraction of total capital invested in asset $A_j$. The return of the portfolio $\\boldsymbol{b}$ if state $S_i$ occurs is given by $W_i(\\boldsymbol{b}) = \\sum_{j=1}^3 b_j X_{ij}$. The investor wishes to find the log-optimal portfolio, also known as the Kelly criterion portfolio, which is the allocation $\\boldsymbol{b}^*=(b_1, b_2, b_3)$ that maximizes the expected value of the natural logarithm of the portfolio return.

The market has two possible, equally likely future states: \"Bullish\" and \"Bearish\", each occurring with a probability of $0.5$.
