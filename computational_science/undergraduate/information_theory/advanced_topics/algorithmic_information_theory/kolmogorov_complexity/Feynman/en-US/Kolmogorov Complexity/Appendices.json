This exercise  uses data duplication, transforming a string $x$ into $xx$, as a model for redundancy.

            "problem": "In the field of algorithmic information theory, a subfield of theoretical computer science, we quantify the complexity of an object by the length of its shortest possible description. For a finite binary string $x$, its Kolmogorov complexity, denoted $K(x)$, is defined with respect to a fixed universal Turing Machine, $U$. It is the length (in bits) of the shortest program $p$ that, when provided as input to $U$, causes $U$ to output the string $x$ and then halt. Formally, $K(x) = \\min\\{|p| : U(p)=x\\}$. While the exact value of $K(x)$ depends on the chosen universal machine $U$, key relationships in complexity theory, such as upper and lower bounds, hold up to an additive constant.\n\nConsider a data processing task where a binary string $x$ is concatenated with itself to form a new string $xx$. This is a simple model for data redundancy. We are interested in the complexity of this new, longer string.\n\nWhich of the following inequalities represents the tightest general upper bound on the Kolmogorov complexity of the string $xx$ for any binary string $x$?

For any total computable function $f$, there exists a constant $c_{f}$ (depending only on $f$ and $U$) such that\n$$\nK(f(x)) \\leq K(x) + c_{f}.\n$$\nDerivation of this standard upper bound: let $p$ be a shortest $U$-program for $x$, so $|p| = K(x)$ and $U(p)=x$. Fix a program $r_{f}$ of constant length $|r_{f}|=c_{f}$ that, given a description of some program $p$, simulates $U(p)$ to obtain $x$, then computes and outputs $f(x)$. Consider the concatenated code $r_{f}p$ (well-formed because we use prefix-free descriptions), which has length $|r_{f}p| = |r_{f}| + |p| = c_{f} + K(x)$ and causes $U$ to output $f(x)$. Therefore\n$$\nK(f(x)) \\leq |r_{f}p| = K(x) + c_{f}.\n$$\n\nApply this with $f(y)=yy$ (duplicate the string). Since $f$ is total computable, there exists a constant $c$ such that\n$$\nK(xx) \\leq K(x) + c.\n$$\n\nThis bound is essentially tight up to an additive constant: define $g(z)$ to be the function that returns the first half of $z$. Then $g$ is total computable and $g(xx)=x$, so by the same reasoning there exists $c'$ with\n$$\nK(x) \\leq K(xx) + c'.\n$$\nHence $K(xx) \\geq K(x) - c'$, which combined with the upper bound shows $K(xx) = K(x) \\pm O(1)$ in general. Among the given options, this makes option A the tightest general upper bound; options B, C, D, and E are looser since they exceed $K(x)+c$ by, respectively, an additional $K(x)$ term, a quadratic term, a growing $\\log_{2}(|x|)$ term, or a replacement of $K(x)$ by the generally larger $|x|$.",

This practice  introduces a powerful non-constructive method known as a counting argument.

            "solution": "The goal is to find the minimum fraction of binary strings of length $n=128$ that are not \"highly compressible\". A string $s$ is defined as highly compressible if its Kolmogorov complexity $K(s) \\leq 118$. Therefore, a string is not highly compressible if $K(s) > 118$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of distinct binary strings of length $n=128$. Since each of the 128 positions in the string can be either a 0 or a 1, the total number of possible strings is $2^{128}$.\n\nNext, we need to find an upper bound on the number of strings that are highly compressible. A string $s$ is highly compressible if $K(s) \\leq 118$. This means there exists a program of length $k \\leq 118$ bits that generates $s$. We can count the total number of such programs.\n\nA program is itself a binary string. The number of possible programs of a specific length $k$ is $2^k$. To find the total number of programs with a length less than or equal to 118, we sum the number of programs for each possible length from $k=0$ to $k=118$.\nLet $N_{programs}$ be the total number of programs with length $k \\leq 118$.\n$$ N_{programs} = \\sum_{k=0}^{118} 2^k $$\nThis is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series $\\sum_{i=0}^{m} r^i$ is given by the formula $\\frac{r^{m+1}-1}{r-1}$. For our case, $r=2$ and $m=118$.\n$$ N_{programs} = \\frac{2^{118+1}-1}{2-1} = 2^{119} - 1 $$\nSo, there are at most $2^{119} - 1$ distinct programs with a length of 118 bits or less.\n\nEach of these short programs can generate at most one unique output string. Therefore, the number of strings that can be generated by these programs is also at most $2^{119} - 1$. This gives us an upper bound on the number of highly compressible strings. Let $N_{comp}$ be the number of highly compressible strings.\n$$ N_{comp} \\leq 2^{119} - 1 $$\nThe maximum possible number of highly compressible strings is $2^{119} - 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum fraction of strings that are *not* highly compressible. Let $N_{not\\_comp}$ be the number of strings that are not highly compressible.\n$$ N_{not\\_comp} = (\\text{Total number of strings}) - N_{comp} $$\nTo find the minimum possible value of $N_{not\\_comp}$, we must subtract the maximum possible value of $N_{comp}$.\n$$ N_{not\\_comp, min} = 2^{128} - (2^{119} - 1) $$\nThe minimum fraction, $f_{min}$, is this minimum number divided by the total number of strings.\n$$ f_{min} = \\frac{N_{not\\_comp, min}}{2^{128}} = \\frac{2^{128} - (2^{119} - 1)}{2^{128}} $$\nWe can split the fraction:\n$$ f_{min} = \\frac{2^{128}}{2^{128}} - \\frac{2^{119}}{2^{128}} + \\frac{1}{2^{128}} $$\n$$ f_{min} = 1 - 2^{119-128} + 2^{-128} $$\n$$ f_{min} = 1 - 2^{-9} + 2^{-128} $$\nNow we evaluate this expression numerically.\n$$ 2^9 = 512 $$\n$$ 2^{-9} = \\frac{1}{512} = 0.001953125 $$\nThe term $2^{-128}$ is extremely small (approximately $2.9 \\times 10^{-39}$) and will not affect the first several significant figures of our result.
