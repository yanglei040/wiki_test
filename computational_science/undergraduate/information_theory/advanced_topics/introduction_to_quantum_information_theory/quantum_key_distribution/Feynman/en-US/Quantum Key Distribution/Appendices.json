            "problem": "Two physicists, Alice and Bob, are testing their new Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system, which operates based on the BB84 protocol. In this protocol, Alice sends quantum bits (qubits) to Bob, encoding classical bits of information.\n\nThe encoding scheme is as follows:\n- To send a classical bit '0', Alice can prepare a qubit in the state $|0\\rangle$ (from the rectilinear basis) or in the state $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$ (from the diagonal basis).\n- To send a classical bit '1', Alice can prepare a qubit in the state $|1\\rangle$ (from the rectilinear basis) or in the state $|-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$ (from the diagonal basis).\n\nFor each qubit she sends, Alice makes two independent random choices: she chooses the classical bit to send (0 or 1, each with 50% probability) and she chooses the basis to use (rectilinear or diagonal, each with 50% probability).\n\nAn eavesdropper, Eve, implements an intercept-resend attack on every single qubit transmitted from Alice to Bob. For each qubit she intercepts, Eve, not knowing Alice's basis choice, randomly chooses a basis (rectilinear or diagonal, each with 50% probability) to perform a measurement. She then sends a new qubit to Bob, prepared in the state corresponding to her measurement outcome and in the basis she used for her measurement.\n\nBob receives the qubit from Eve and, not knowing Alice's or Eve's basis choice, also randomly chooses a basis (rectilinear or diagonal, each with 50% probability) to perform his measurement.\n\nAfter the entire sequence of qubits has been transmitted and measured, Alice and Bob communicate over a public channel to compare the bases they used for each bit. They discard all bits for which their basis choices did not match. The remaining bits form the sifted key.\n\nCalculate the expected Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), defined as the probability that a bit in Bob's sifted key does not match the corresponding bit that Alice originally sent.

            "solution": "Let $X \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote Alice's bit, $A \\in \\{\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{D}\\}$ Alice's basis (rectilinear or diagonal), $E \\in \\{\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{D}\\}$ Eve's basis, and $B \\in \\{\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{D}\\}$ Bob's basis. Let $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote Bob's measurement outcome interpreted as a bit in his chosen basis. The sifted set corresponds to the event $S=\\{A=B\\}$. The Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) is the conditional probability\n$$\n\\mathrm{QBER}=P(Y \\neq X \\mid S).\n$$\nUsing the law of total probability with respect to whether Eve's basis matches Alice's basis,\n$$\nP(Y \\neq X \\mid S)=P(E=A \\mid S)\\,P(Y \\neq X \\mid S,E=A)+P(E \\neq A \\mid S)\\,P(Y \\neq X \\mid S,E \\neq A).\n$$\nBecause $E$ is chosen independently of $A$ and $B$, conditioning on $S$ does not change the distribution of $E$ relative to $A$:\n$$\nP(E=A \\mid S)=\\frac{P(E=A, S)}{P(S)}=\\frac{P(E=A)\\,P(S)}{P(S)}=P(E=A)=\\frac{1}{2},\n$$\nand thus $P(E \\neq A \\mid S)=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nEvaluate the two conditional error probabilities:\n1) If $E=A$ and $S$ holds (so $B=A$), Eve measures in Alice's basis and resends the corresponding eigenstate in that basis. Bob then measures in the same basis $A$, obtaining the same bit with certainty by projective measurement of an eigenstate. Hence\n$$\nP(Y \\neq X \\mid S,E=A)=0.\n$$\n2) If $E \\neq A$ and $S$ holds (so $B=A \\neq E$), Eve measures in the conjugate basis. For example, if Alice sent $|0\\rangle$ (basis $\\mathcal{R}$) and Eve measures in $\\mathcal{D}$, Eve's result is $|+\\rangle$ or $|-\\rangle$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ each, and she resends that state.

After exchanging qubits and publicly announcing their measurement bases, they have produced a raw sifted key of length $N$. This key is a string of bits shared between them, but it is not yet secure.\n\nDue to imperfections in the quantum channel and the potential for eavesdropping, a fraction $\\delta$ of the bits in Bob's sifted key are different from Alice's corresponding bits. This is known as the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER).\n\nTo transform their noisy, potentially compromised sifted key into a final, perfectly secure key of length $k$, they must perform two classical post-processing steps:\n\n1.  **Error Correction**: To correct the errors, Alice and Bob must communicate over a public channel. A particular error correction protocol they use leaks an amount of information equivalent to $1.1 \\cdot h_2(\\delta)$ bits for each bit of the raw sifted key.\n2.  **Privacy Amplification**: To eliminate any information an eavesdropper, Eve, might have gained, they must shorten their key. The maximum information Eve can gain about each bit of the sifted key, under an optimal intercept-resend attack that would induce a QBER of $\\delta$, is given by $h_2(\\delta)$ bits. To ensure the final key is completely secret from Eve, they must sacrifice this number of bits from their key for each bit of the original sifted key.\n\nThe function $h_2(\\delta)$ is the binary entropy function, defined as $h_2(\\delta) = -\\delta \\log_2(\\delta) - (1-\\delta) \\log_2(1-\\delta)$.\n\nAssuming that the bits sacrificed for error correction and privacy amplification are independent losses, derive a symbolic expression for the minimum length $N$ of the raw sifted key that Alice and Bob must start with to produce a final secret key of length $k$. Your expression should be in terms of $k$ and $h_2(\\delta)$.",

Interpreting this as bits that must be sacrificed from the original $N$ bits, the total loss due to error correction is $N \\cdot \\frac{11}{10} h_{2}(\\delta)$ bits.\n- Privacy amplification requires sacrificing $h_{2}(\\delta)$ bits per sifted bit, so the total loss due to privacy amplification is $N \\cdot h_{2}(\\delta)$ bits.\n\nAssuming the two sacrifices are independent losses that add, the total number of bits sacrificed is\n$$\nN \\left(\\frac{11}{10} h_{2}(\\delta) + h_{2}(\\delta)\\right) \\;=\\; N \\cdot \\frac{21}{10} h_{2}(\\delta).\n$$\nTherefore, the final key length $k$ after both steps satisfies\n$$\nk \\;=\\; N - N \\cdot \\frac{21}{10} h_{2}(\\delta) \\;=\\; N \\left(1 - \\frac{21}{10} h_{2}(\\delta)\\right).\n$$\nSolving for the minimum required $N$ yields\n$$\nN \\;=\\; \\frac{k}{1 - \\frac{21}{10} h_{2}(\\delta)}.\n$$\nA necessary feasibility condition for a positive key rate is $1 - \\frac{21}{10} h_{2}(\\delta) > 0$, equivalently $h_{2}(\\delta) < \\frac{10}{21}$.",
