            "problem": "In a quantum computation experiment, a single qubit is manipulated using a time-dependent process. The operation is mathematically described by the unitary evolution operator $U(t) = \\exp(-i \\sigma_x t)$, where $t$ is a dimensionless time parameter and $\\sigma_x$ is the Pauli-X matrix. The qubit exists in a two-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by the computational basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, which are represented by the column vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, respectively.\n\nThe experiment proceeds as follows: the qubit is first prepared in the initial state $|1\\rangle$. Then, the unitary operation $U(t)$ is applied for a duration of $t = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Immediately after the operation, a measurement is performed on the qubit in the computational basis.\n\nCalculate the probability of finding the qubit in the state $|0\\rangle$ after this process. Report your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The initial state of the qubit is given as $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |1\\rangle$. In the computational basis, this is represented by the vector:\n$$\n|\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe evolution of the state is governed by the unitary operator $U(t) = \\exp(-i \\sigma_x t)$. The final state at time $t$, denoted by $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$, is given by the action of this operator on the initial state:\n$$\n|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t) |\\psi(0)\\rangle\n$$\nTo evaluate the operator $U(t)$, we can use the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function. However, a more direct method for Pauli matrices is to use the property $\\sigma_x^2 = I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. The Pauli-X matrix is:\n$$\n\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAnd its square is:\n$$\n\\sigma_x^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = I\n$$\nWe can use the Euler formula for matrix exponentials: for any matrix $A$ such that $A^2 = I$, we have $\\exp(i \\theta A) = I \\cos(\\theta) + i A \\sin(\\theta)$. In our case, the operator is $U(t) = \\exp(-i t \\sigma_x)$. Let's set $\\theta = t$ and the matrix as $-\\sigma_x$. We check that $(-\\sigma_x)^2 = (-1)^2 \\sigma_x^2 = I$. Therefore, the formula applies directly by identifying $A = -\\sigma_x$:\n$$\nU(t) = \\exp((-i t) \\sigma_x) = \\exp(i t (-\\sigma_x)) = I \\cos(t) + i(-\\sigma_x) \\sin(t) = I \\cos(t) - i \\sigma_x \\sin(t)\n$$\nWe are given that the evolution happens for a time $t = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.

This probability, $P(0)$, is the squared magnitude of the amplitude of the $|0\\rangle$ component in the final state vector. The amplitude is the inner product of the state $|0\\rangle$ with the final state $|\\psi(\\frac{\\pi}{4})\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\text{amplitude} = \\langle 0 | \\psi\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} -i \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ((1)(-i) + (0)(1)) = \\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe probability is the squared absolute value of this amplitude:\n$$\nP(0) = |\\langle 0 | \\psi\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\rangle|^2 = \\left| \\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2\n$$\nThe absolute value of a complex number $z = a+ib$ is $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.
