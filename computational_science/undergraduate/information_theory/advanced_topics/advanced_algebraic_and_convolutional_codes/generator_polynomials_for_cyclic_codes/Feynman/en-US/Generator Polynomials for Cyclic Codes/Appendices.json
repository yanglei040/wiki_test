This exercise challenges you to verify the validity of a potential generator polynomial for a binary cyclic code of a specific length, $n$. The core principle to apply is that a polynomial $g(x)$ can only generate a cyclic code of length $n$ if it is a divisor of $x^n + 1$ over the field $GF(2)$, a critical rule that underpins the entire structure of these codes .",

            "problem": "In the design of error-correcting codes for digital communication systems, binary cyclic codes are favored for their efficient implementation. A polynomial $g(x)$ with coefficients in the binary field $F_2$ is said to generate a binary cyclic code of length $n$ if the set of all codewords consists of polynomials of degree less than $n$ which are multiples of $g(x)$, and this set of codewords is closed under cyclic shifts. A fundamental requirement for such a code to exist is that the generator polynomial $g(x)$ must divide the polynomial $x^n+1$ in the polynomial ring $F_2[x]$, where all coefficient arithmetic is performed modulo 2.\n\nConsider a system designed to use a binary cyclic code of length $n=7$. An engineer has proposed four different polynomials to be used as the generator. However, one of these proposals is invalid because it does not satisfy the fundamental requirement for the given code length.\n\nIdentify the invalid polynomial from the list below.\n\nA. $g_A(x) = x+1$\n\nB. $g_B(x) = x^3+x+1$\n\nC. $g_C(x) = x^2+1$\n\nD. $g_D(x) = (x+1)(x^3+x+1)$",
            "solution": "A binary cyclic code of length $n$ over $F_{2}$ exists with generator $g(x)$ if and only if $g(x)$ divides $x^{n}+1$ in $F_{2}[x]$. We must determine, for $n=7$, which proposed $g(x)$ does not divide $x^{7}+1$.\n\nFirst, use the Remainder Theorem in $F_{2}$ to test $g_{A}(x)=x+1$. The remainder of dividing any polynomial $f(x)$ by $x+1$ is $f(1)$. Compute $f(1)$ for $f(x)=x^{7}+1$:\n$$\n1^{7}+1=1+1=0 \\quad \\text{in } F_{2}.\n$$\nThus $x+1$ divides $x^{7}+1$, so $A$ is valid.\n\nNext, consider $g_{B}(x)=x^{3}+x+1$. Let $\\alpha$ be a root of $x^{3}+x+1$ in an extension field. Since $x^{3}+x+1$ is irreducible over $F_{2}$, the field $F_{2}(\\alpha)$ has $2^{3}=8$ elements, and its multiplicative group has order $7$. The only possible orders of a nonzero element are the divisors of $7$, namely $1$ and $7$. Evaluate $x^{3}+x+1$ at $x=1$:\n$$\n1^{3}+1+1=1 \\neq 0 \\quad \\text{in } F_{2},\n$$\nso $\\alpha \\neq 1$. Hence $\\alpha$ has order $7$, so $\\alpha^{7}=1$, which means $\\alpha$ is a root of $x^{7}+1$. Therefore the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$, namely $x^{3}+x+1$, divides $x^{7}+1$, and $B$ is valid.\n\nFor $g_{D}(x)=(x+1)(x^{3}+x+1)$, since each factor divides $x^{7}+1$ and\n$$\n\\gcd(x+1,\\,x^{3}+x+1)=1 \\quad \\text{(because } (x^{3}+x+1)(1)=1 \\neq 0 \\text{ in } F_{2}),\n$$\nit follows from the property that if $g_{1} \\mid P$ and $g_{2} \\mid P$ with $\\gcd(g_{1},g_{2})=1$, then $g_{1}g_{2} \\mid P$, that $(x+1)(x^{3}+x+1)$ divides $x^{7}+1$. Thus $D$ is valid.\n\nFinally, examine $g_{C}(x)=x^{2}+1$. Over $F_{2}$,\n$$\nx^{2}+1=(x+1)^{2},\n$$\nsince $(x+1)^{2}=x^{2}+2x+1=x^{2}+1$ in $F_{2}$. If $(x+1)^{2}$ were to divide $x^{7}+1$, then $x=1$ would be a double root of $x^{7}+1$. The multiplicity of a root can be checked via the formal derivative. Compute the derivative in $F_{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{7}+1\\right)=7x^{6}=x^{6} \\quad \\text{in } F_{2}.\n$$\nEvaluate at $x=1$:\n$$\n(x^{6})(1)=1 \\neq 0 \\quad \\text{in } F_{2}.\n$$\nTherefore $x=1$ is a simple root of $x^{7}+1$, so $(x+1)^{2}$ does not divide $x^{7}+1$. Hence $x^{2}+1$ does not divide $x^{7}+1$, and $C$ is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the invalid generator polynomial is $g_{C}(x)=x^{2}+1$.",

All polynomial operations are performed in the finite field $GF(2)$, where addition is equivalent to the logical XOR operation.

By definition, any valid codeword, represented as a polynomial $c(x)$, is a multiple of $g(x)$.\n\nDuring a read operation, a single bit flip occurs at the highest-order bit position of a 7-bit data block (block length $n=7$, with bit positions indexed from 0 to 6). This single-bit error can be described by the error polynomial $e(x) = x^6$. The polynomial representing the read data is $r(x) = c(x) + e(x)$.\n\nThe error detection mechanism works by calculating the syndrome polynomial, $s(x)$, which is defined as the remainder when the read data polynomial $r(x)$ is divided by the generator polynomial $g(x)$.\n\nCalculate the syndrome polynomial $s(x)$ that results from this specific error.",
            "solution": "The syndrome polynomial $s(x)$ is defined as the remainder of the division of the received polynomial $r(x)$ by the generator polynomial $g(x)$. This can be written using modular arithmetic as:\n$$s(x) = r(x) \\pmod{g(x)}$$\nWe are given that the received polynomial is $r(x) = c(x) + e(x)$, where $c(x)$ is the transmitted codeword polynomial and $e(x)$ is the error polynomial. Substituting this into the syndrome equation gives:\n$$s(x) = [c(x) + e(x)] \\pmod{g(x)}$$\nUsing the properties of modular arithmetic, we can separate the terms:\n$$s(x) = [c(x) \\pmod{g(x)}] + [e(x) \\pmod{g(x)}]$$\nBy the definition of a cyclic code, any valid codeword polynomial $c(x)$ is a multiple of the generator polynomial $g(x)$. This means that the remainder when $c(x)$ is divided by $g(x)$ is zero.\n$$c(x) \\pmod{g(x)} = 0$$\nTherefore, the syndrome calculation simplifies to finding the remainder of the error polynomial when divided by the generator polynomial:\n$$s(x) = e(x) \\pmod{g(x)}$$\nWe are given the error polynomial $e(x) = x^6$ and the generator polynomial $g(x) = x^3 + x + 1$.
