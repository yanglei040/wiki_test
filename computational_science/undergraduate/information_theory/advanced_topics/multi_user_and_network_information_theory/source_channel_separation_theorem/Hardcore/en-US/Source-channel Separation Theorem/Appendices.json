This practice puts that principle into action by asking you to quantify the 'information load' of a multi-source system. By calculating the total entropy rate of two independent sensors, you will determine the absolute minimum channel capacity required for reliable data transmission .",

            "problem": "A research team is designing a simple wireless sensor network to monitor environmental conditions in a remote habitat. The network consists of two independent types of sensors, whose data must be multiplexed and transmitted over a single digital communication channel.\n\n- **Sensor A (Temperature):** This sensor reports the ambient temperature state as either \"Nominal\" or \"Elevated\". Extensive prior measurements indicate that the \"Nominal\" state occurs with a probability of $p_A = \\frac{7}{8}$. This sensor generates one report every 2.0 seconds.\n\n- **Sensor B (Vibration):** This sensor detects ground vibrations and classifies them into one of three states: \"Quiescent\", \"Minor\", or \"Significant\". The probabilities of these states are $p_Q = \\frac{1}{2}$, $p_M = \\frac{1}{4}$, and $p_S = \\frac{1}{4}$, respectively. This sensor generates one report every 0.5 seconds.\n\nTo ensure the data from both sensors can be reconstructed at the receiver with an arbitrarily low probability of error, the capacity of the communication channel must be sufficient to handle the total information rate generated by the sensors.\n\nCalculate the minimum required channel capacity, in bits per second, needed to reliably transmit the data from both sensors. Round your final answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The minimum channel capacity, $C_{min}$, required for reliable transmission is equal to the total information rate, $R_{total}$, of the source. Since the two sensors operate independently, their total information rate is the sum of their individual information rates. We will calculate the information rate for each sensor separately and then add them. The information rate $R$ of a source is the product of its symbol rate $R_s$ and its entropy per symbol $H(X)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Sensor A. Let $X_A$ be the random variable representing the output of Sensor A. The possible outcomes are \"Nominal\" and \"Elevated\".\nThe probability of a \"Nominal\" reading is given as $P(X_A = \\text{Nominal}) = \\frac{7}{8}$.\nThe probability of an \"Elevated\" reading is therefore $P(X_A = \\text{Elevated}) = 1 - \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nThe entropy of Sensor A, $H(X_A)$, is calculated using the formula for the entropy of a discrete random variable, $H(X) = -\\sum_{i} p_i \\log_2(p_i)$.\n$$H(X_A) = - \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right) + \\frac{1}{8} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(a/b) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)$ and $\\log_2(1) = 0$, $\\log_2(8) = 3$:\n$$H(X_A) = - \\left( \\frac{7}{8} (\\log_2(7) - \\log_2(8)) + \\frac{1}{8} (\\log_2(1) - \\log_2(8)) \\right)$$\n$$H(X_A) = - \\left( \\frac{7}{8} (\\log_2(7) - 3) + \\frac{1}{8} (0 - 3) \\right)$$\n$$H(X_A) = - \\frac{7}{8} \\log_2(7) + \\frac{21}{8} - \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{18}{8} - \\frac{7}{8} \\log_2(7) = 2.25 - \\frac{7}{8} \\log_2(7) \\text{ bits/symbol}$$\nLet's re-calculate:\n$H(X_A) = - \\frac{7}{8} \\log_2(7) + \\frac{21}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{24}{8} - \\frac{7}{8} \\log_2(7) = 3 - \\frac{7}{8} \\log_2(7)$ bits/symbol.\nA simpler calculation: $H(p) = -p \\log_2(p) - (1-p) \\log_2(1-p)$. With $p=1/8$:\n$H(1/8) = - (1/8)\\log_2(1/8) - (7/8)\\log_2(7/8) = - (1/8)(-3) - (7/8)(\\log_2(7)-3) = 3/8 - (7/8)\\log_2(7) + 21/8 = 24/8 - (7/8)\\log_2(7) = 3 - (7/8)\\log_2(7)$.\nThe original solution text had a minor calculation error (`+ 3/8` became `- 3/8`). Let's use the decimal value: $H(1/8) \\approx 0.54356$ bits/symbol.\nThe symbol rate of Sensor A is $R_{s,A} = \\frac{1 \\text{ report}}{2.0 \\text{ s}} = 0.5 \\text{ symbols/s}$.\nThe information rate of Sensor A is $R_A = R_{s,A} \\times H(X_A) \\approx 0.5 \\times 0.54356 \\approx 0.27178 \\text{ bits/s}$.\n\nNext, let's analyze Sensor B. Let $X_B$ be the random variable representing the output of Sensor B. The outcomes are \"Quiescent\", \"Minor\", and \"Significant\" with probabilities $p_Q = 1/2$, $p_M = 1/4$, and $p_S = 1/4$.\nThe entropy of Sensor B, $H(X_B)$, is:\n$$H(X_B) = - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\right)$$\nSince $\\log_2(1/2) = -1$ and $\\log_2(1/4) = -2$:\n$$H(X_B) = - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (-1) + \\frac{1}{4} (-2) + \\frac{1}{4} (-2) \\right) = - \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\text{ bits/symbol}$$\nThe symbol rate of Sensor B is $R_{s,B} = \\frac{1 \\text{ report}}{0.5 \\text{ s}} = 2.0 \\text{ symbols/s}$.\nThe information rate of Sensor B is $R_B = R_{s,B} \\times H(X_B)$:\n$$R_B = 2.0 \\times 1.5 = 3.0 \\text{ bits/s}$$\n\nThe total information rate $R_{total}$ is the sum of $R_A$ and $R_B$:\n$$R_{total} = R_A + R_B \\approx 0.27178 + 3.0 = 3.27178 \\text{ bits/s}$$\nThe minimum required channel capacity is $C_{min} = R_{total}$.\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$C_{min} \\approx 3.27 \\text{ bits/s}$$",

It can only report one of three states: 'Sunny' (S), 'Cloudy' (C), or 'Rainy' (R).
