            "introduction": "To truly master the concept of collision entropy, we must move from theoretical definitions to practical application. This section provides a series of hands-on exercises designed to build your skills progressively. We will start with a direct numerical calculation, then advance to deriving a general formula for a fundamental probability distribution, and finally, tackle a conceptual proof that illuminates a key property of information. These practices will not only reinforce your computational abilities but also deepen your intuitive understanding of how collision entropy quantifies uncertainty. Note that collision entropy can be expressed in different units depending on the base of the logarithm used; 'nats' for the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) and 'bits' for the base-2 logarithm ($\\log_2$). While the principles are identical, pay close attention to the definition provided in each problem.\n\nOur first exercise grounds the abstract definition of collision entropy in a concrete scenario from biophysics. By calculating the collision entropy for a simplified model of an ion channel, you will practice the fundamental computational steps: determining the collision probability from a given set of state probabilities and then converting it into an entropy value. This straightforward calculation is the bedrock upon which more complex information-theoretic analyses are built. ",

            "problem": "A biophysics research group develops a simplified statistical model for the behavior of a single ion channel in a cell membrane. At any given moment, the channel is assumed to be in one of three distinct conformational states: 'Open' (allowing ions to pass), 'Closed' (blocking ion flow), or 'Inactivated' (a different type of non-conducting state). Based on extensive experimental data, the probability of finding the channel in the 'Open' state is $0.6$, in the 'Closed' state is $0.3$, and in the 'Inactivated' state is $0.1$.\n\nFor a discrete random variable $X$ with outcomes $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$ and a probability mass function $P(X=x_i) = p_i$, a quantity known as the collision probability, $P_{\\text{coll}}(X)$, is defined as the probability that two independent samples drawn from this distribution are identical. Mathematically, it is given by $P_{\\text{coll}}(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2$. The Rényi entropy of order 2, often denoted $H_2(X)$, is then defined as $H_2(X) = -\\ln(P_{\\text{coll}}(X))$, where $\\ln$ is the natural logarithm.\n\nCalculate the Rényi entropy of order 2, $H_2(X)$, for the described ion channel model.
