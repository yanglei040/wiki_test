            "problem": "In the field of quantum computation, a single quantum bit (qubit) can be manipulated using a series of quantum gates. The state of a qubit is described by a state vector in a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space. The standard computational basis states are denoted as $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n\nConsider a single qubit prepared in the uniform superposition state, denoted as $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$.

The initial state is $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$. The sequence of operations consists of a Pauli-Z gate followed by a Hadamard gate. In quantum mechanics, operators are applied sequentially. If gate $G_1$ is applied first, followed by gate $G_2$, the combined operation is described by the matrix product $G_2 G_1$.

Let us track each basis state through the sequence:\n- Start with $\\lvert 00\\rangle$. Applying $U_{12}$ leaves it unchanged since the control qubit is $0$, giving $\\lvert 00\\rangle$. Applying $U_{21}$ leaves it unchanged since the control qubit is $0$, giving $\\lvert 00\\rangle$. Applying $U_{12}$ again leaves it unchanged. Thus $\\lvert 00\\rangle\\mapsto\\lvert 00\\rangle$.\n- Start with $\\lvert 01\\rangle$. Applying $U_{12}$ leaves it unchanged (control is $0$), giving $\\lvert 01\\rangle$. Applying $U_{21}$ flips the first qubit (control is $1$), giving $\\lvert 11\\rangle$. Applying $U_{12}$ flips the second qubit (control is $1$), giving $\\lvert 10\\rangle$. Thus $\\lvert 01\\rangle\\mapsto\\lvert 10\\rangle$.\n- Start with $\\lvert 10\\rangle$. Applying $U_{12}$ flips the second qubit (control is $1$), giving $\\lvert 11\\rangle$. Applying $U_{21}$ flips the first qubit (control is $1$), giving $\\lvert 01\\rangle$. Applying $U_{12}$ leaves it unchanged (control is $0$), giving $\\lvert 01\\rangle$. Thus $\\lvert 10\\rangle\\mapsto\\lvert 01\\rangle$.\n- Start with $\\lvert 11\\rangle$. Applying $U_{12}$ flips the second qubit (control is $1$), giving $\\lvert 10\\rangle$.
