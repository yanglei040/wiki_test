This exercise invites you to analyze a modified protocol where the verifier, Arthur, operates deterministically, without access to random bits .

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the class AM, which stands for Arthur-Merlin, characterizes languages for which membership can be verified through a two-round interactive protocol. For an input string $x$ of length $n$, the protocol proceeds as follows:\n1.  The verifier, Arthur, who is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine, generates a random string $r$ of length polynomial in $n$ and sends it to the prover, Merlin.\n2.  The prover, Merlin, who has unbounded computational power, receives $r$ and sends back a response string $y$ (the \"proof\") of length polynomial in $n$.\n3.  Arthur then deterministically computes a result based on the input $x$, his random string $r$, and Merlin's response $y$.\n\nA language $L$ is in AM if there exists such a protocol satisfying:\n-   **Completeness:** If $x \\in L$, there is a strategy for Merlin to choose $y$ such that Arthur accepts with probability at least $2/3$ (over the choices of $r$).\n-   **Soundness:** If $x \\notin L$, for any strategy Merlin uses to choose $y$, Arthur accepts with probability at most $1/3$ (over the choices of $r$).\n\nNow, consider a modified version of this class, which we will call DAM (Deterministic-Arthur-Merlin). In the DAM protocol, Arthur is a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine, meaning he has no access to random bits. Consequently, in the first step, Arthur sends a predefined, empty, or constant string to Merlin, as he cannot generate a random challenge. Merlin then sends his proof $y$, and Arthur makes a final, deterministic decision based on $x$ and $y$.\n\nWhich of the following complexity classes is equivalent to DAM?\n\nA.

            "solution": "Let's analyze the definition of the modified complexity class, DAM (Deterministic-Arthur-Merlin).\n\nThe protocol for a language $L$ in DAM is as follows:\n1.  For a given input string $x$, Arthur, a deterministic polynomial-time machine, prepares a message to send to Merlin. Since Arthur is deterministic and has no access to randomness, his message cannot depend on a random string. He can only compute a message based on $x$. However, the standard AM protocol has Arthur's first message as the *only* source of randomness. In a deterministic variant, this message is fixed (e.g., an empty string) and contains no information that Merlin doesn't already have. Therefore, the first round is trivial, and we can model the protocol as Merlin simply sending a proof string $y$ to Arthur.\n2.  Merlin, with his unbounded computational power, sends a proof string $y$ to Arthur. The length of $y$ must be polynomial in the length of $x$.\n3.  Arthur, a deterministic polynomial-time verifier, receives $y$ and decides whether to accept or reject based on the input $x$ and the proof $y$. Let's denote Arthur's verification procedure by a polynomial-time algorithm $V(x, y)$, which outputs 1 for \"accept\" and 0 for \"reject\".\n\nNow let's translate the completeness and soundness conditions from AM into the context of DAM. Since there is no randomness, the probabilities of acceptance are either 0 or 1.\n\n-   **Completeness:** If $x \\in L$, there must exist a strategy for Merlin such that Arthur accepts. Since Arthur's final decision is deterministic, this means there must exist a proof string $y$ (of polynomial length) such that $V(x, y) = 1$. The \"probability\" is 1, which satisfies the condition of being $\\geq 2/3$.\n\n-   **Soundness:** If $x \\notin L$, for any strategy Merlin uses, Arthur must reject. This means for any proof string $y$ that Merlin could possibly send, Arthur's verification must fail. That is, for all strings $y$ (of polynomial length), $V(x, y) = 0$. The \"probability\" of acceptance is 0, which satisfies the condition of being $\\leq 1/3$.\n\nSo, a language $L$ is in DAM if and only if there exists a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm $V$ and a polynomial function $p$ such that for any input string $x$:\n$x \\in L \\iff \\exists y$ with $|y| \\leq p(|x|)$ such that $V(x, y) = 1$.\n\nThis is precisely the verifier-based definition of the complexity class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time). In the context of NP, the string $y$ is called a \"certificate\" or a \"witness\". The definition of NP states that a language $L$ is in NP if there exists a polynomial-time verifier $V$ such that for every $x$, $x \\in L$ if and only if there exists a certificate $y$ of polynomial length in $|x|$ that $V$ accepts.\n\nOur derived definition for DAM is identical to the definition of NP.\n\nLet's consider the other options:\n-   **A. P:** This would be the case if Arthur could decide the language on his own in polynomial time, without needing a proof from Merlin. Our definition allows for problems where finding the proof $y$ might be hard, but verifying it is easy, which is the essence of NP problems that are not known to be in P (like SAT).\n-   **C. co-NP:** A language is in co-NP if its complement is in NP. This means for \"no\" instances ($x \\notin L$), there exists a short proof of non-membership. Our DAM definition requires proofs for \"yes\" instances ($x \\in L$).\n-   **D. BPP:** This class is defined by probabilistic algorithms. We explicitly removed randomness from Arthur, so the resulting class is not probabilistic.\n-   **E. PSPACE:** While NP is contained in PSPACE, there is no reason to believe they are equal. The DAM protocol only grants Arthur polynomial time, not polynomial space, so there is no reason for it to be as powerful as PSPACE.\n\nTherefore, the modified class DAM is equivalent to NP.",

For the purposes of this problem, consider a single-round protocol where Merlin sends a single proof string to Arthur. Arthur then performs a randomized computation, which must be completed in time polynomial in the input size, to decide whether to accept or reject Merlin's claim.\n\nConsider the following decision problem: given an $n \\times n$ matrix $M$ with entries from a large finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and an integer $k$ (where $1 \\leq k \\leq n$), decide if the rank of $M$ is at least $k$.

The decision problem is to verify whether $\\operatorname{rank}(M) \\geq k$. This is equivalent to the existence of a $k \\times k$ nonsingular submatrix $A$ of $M$, since $\\operatorname{rank}(M) \\geq k$ if and only if $M$ has $k$ linearly independent columns (or rows), which is equivalent to having a $k \\times k$ submatrix with nonzero determinant.\n\nConsider option D. Merlin identifies a $k \\times k$ submatrix $A$ and provides a matrix $B$ claimed to be $A^{-1}$. Arthur picks a random $v \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k}$, computes $w = B v$, then computes $w' = A w = A(Bv)$, and accepts if $w' = v$. The verification predicate is that $A B v = v$. Let $I_{k}$ denote the $k \\times k$ identity matrix.\n\nCompleteness: If $\\operatorname{rank}(M) \\geq k$, there exists a $k \\times k$ nonsingular submatrix $A$.

This is multi-round (Arthur sends $u, v$ to Merlin) and does not test nonsingularity: equality of $u^{T} A v$ can hold regardless of whether $A$ is singular. It fails both the single-round constraint and soundness.\n\nB. Merlin sends indices of a $k \\times k$ submatrix $A$. Arthur picks random $v_{1},\\dots,v_{k} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k}$ and accepts if $\\{A v_{i}\\}$ are linearly independent. Even if $A$ is nonsingular, the randomly chosen $\\{v_{i}\\}$ can be linearly dependent with positive probability, causing rejection on a true claim.

This is a standard interactive proof: Arthur sends a random $r \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k}$, Merlin returns $x$ with $A x = r$. It has completeness $1$ and soundness at most $\\frac{1}{q}$, but it is not single-round, since Arthur sends a challenge to Merlin. Therefore it violates the single-round constraint.\n\nOnly D satisfies single-round, completeness $1$, soundness at most $\\frac{1}{2}$, and efficiency.",

Moreover, certifying nonexistence for each $(h,z)$ is coNP-hard without the arithmetized interactive proof structure.\n- C: A single random evaluation $P(r)$ provides no certificate that the full hypercube sum is zero, and having Merlin report $P(r)$ is useless unless Arthur can verify it independently, which reduces to the full sumcheck framework anyway; as stated, it is unsound.\n- D: The described graph has $2^{n}$ vertices; constructing and verifying a certificate of a singleton connected component among satisfying assignments is not polynomial-time checkable.\n- E: TQBF is PSPACE-complete and not known to be in AM; invoking an AM protocol for TQBF is invalid.\n\nHence, only B describes a correct AM mechanism for proving uniqueness.",
