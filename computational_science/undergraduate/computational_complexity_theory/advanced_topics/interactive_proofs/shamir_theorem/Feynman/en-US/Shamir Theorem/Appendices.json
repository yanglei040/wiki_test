This exercise  provides foundational practice in this translation, focusing on converting a Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) into a multivariate polynomial. By working through the conversion of logical connectives like $\\land$ (AND), $\\lor$ (OR), and $\\neg$ (NOT) into arithmetic operations and simplifying the result, you will build the essential skills needed to analyze logical formulas using algebraic tools.",

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, particularly in the context of interactive proof systems, Boolean formulas are often converted into multivariate polynomials over integers. This process, known as arithmetization, allows logical properties to be analyzed using algebraic tools.\n\nConsider a Boolean formula $\\phi$ involving variables $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$. The arithmetization process maps this to a polynomial $P_\\phi(z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_n)$ based on the following rules:\n- Each Boolean variable $x_i \\in \\{\\text{true}, \\text{false}\\}$ is mapped to an integer variable $z_i \\in \\{1, 0\\}$, where `true` corresponds to 1 and `false` to 0.\n- A literal $x_i$ is mapped to the polynomial $z_i$.\n- A negated literal $\\neg x_i$ is mapped to the polynomial $(1-z_i)$.\n- A conjunction (AND, $\\land$) of two subformulas, $\\psi_1 \\land \\psi_2$, is mapped to the product of their corresponding polynomials: $P_{\\psi_1} \\cdot P_{\\psi_2}$.\n- A disjunction (OR, $\\lor$) of two subformulas, $\\psi_1 \\lor \\psi_2$, is mapped to the polynomial $1 - (1-P_{\\psi_1})(1-P_{\\psi_2})$.\n\nAfter constructing the initial polynomial, it is fully expanded and simplified. A crucial simplification rule, stemming from the fact that $z_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, is that for any integer power $k \\ge 1$, we can replace $z_i^k$ with $z_i$. For example, a term like $3z_1^3 z_2^5$ simplifies to $3z_1 z_2$.\n\nConsider the following Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) over three variables:\n$$ \\phi(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (\\neg x_1 \\lor \\neg x_2) \\land (\\neg x_1 \\lor \\neg x_3) \\land (\\neg x_2 \\lor \\neg x_3) $$\n\nFollowing the arithmetization and simplification rules described above, find the total degree of the final simplified polynomial $P_\\phi(z_1, z_2, z_3)$.

            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, Shamir's Theorem states that the class of problems with Interactive Proof systems (IP) is equal to the class of problems solvable in Polynomial Space (PSPACE). A key part of this theorem's proof is an interactive protocol for the True Quantified Boolean Formula (TQBF) problem, which is PSPACE-complete.\n\nThis protocol involves a process called arithmetization. A Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) is converted into a polynomial expression over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Boolean variables $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ are treated as field elements. The logical operations are converted as follows: $\\neg x$ becomes $1-x$, $a \\land b$ becomes $ab$, and $a \\lor b$ becomes $a+b-ab$. Quantifiers are also arithmetized: $\\exists x_i$ is replaced by a sum $\\sum_{x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}}$, and $\\forall x_i$ is replaced by a product $\\prod_{x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}}$. A QBF is true if and only if its arithmetized form evaluates to a non-zero value in $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nConsider the following QBF, which is known to be false:\n$$ \\phi = \\exists x_1 \\forall x_2 (x_1 \\leftrightarrow x_2) $$\nThe arithmetization of the inner clause $(x_1 \\leftrightarrow x_2)$ is the polynomial $P(x_1, x_2) = 2x_1x_2 - x_1 - x_2 + 1$. The entire formula $\\phi$ correctly evaluates to 0.\n\nAn all-powerful but dishonest prover, Merlin, wants to convince a verifier, Arthur, that the value of $\\phi$ is 1. The protocol operates over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{101}$.\n\nThe protocol proceeds in rounds, one for each variable, from outermost to innermost.\n1.  **Round 1 ($\\exists x_1$):**\n    The arithmetization of the subformula $\\forall x_2 (x_1 \\leftrightarrow x_2)$ results in a polynomial in $x_1$, which we call $P_1(x_1)$. Merlin is supposed to send this polynomial to Arthur. Since the quantifier is $\\exists x_1$, Arthur would check if $P_1(0) + P_1(1)$ equals the claimed value of $\\phi$. Instead, Merlin sends a (potentially fraudulent) polynomial $P'_1(z)$. Arthur checks if $P'_1(0) + P'_1(1) = 1$. If this check fails, Arthur rejects.\n2.  If the check passes, Arthur picks a value $c_1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_{101}$ and sends it to Merlin. The protocol then continues on the sub-problem of verifying that $P_1(c_1)$ equals the value $P'_1(c_1)$ computed by Arthur.\n\nA particular implementation of Arthur is flawed: instead of choosing a random $c_1$, it always picks the predetermined value $c_1 = 5$. Merlin is aware of this flaw. To construct a successful deception, Merlin crafts a fraudulent polynomial $P'_1(z)$ that must satisfy two conditions:\n(i) It must pass Arthur's initial check based on the quantifier.\n(ii) It must agree with the true polynomial $P_1(z)$ at the specific point Arthur will check, i.e., $P'_1(5) = P_1(5)$. This ensures Merlin's lie is not immediately exposed.\n\nMerlin constructs his fraudulent polynomial to be of the form $P'_1(z) = az^2 + bz$.
