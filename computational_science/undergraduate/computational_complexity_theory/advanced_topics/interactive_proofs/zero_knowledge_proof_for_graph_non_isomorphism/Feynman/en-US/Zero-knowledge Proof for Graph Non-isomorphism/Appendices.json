This first exercise places you in that role, examining the protocol for graph non-isomorphism under the condition that the prover's claim is false—the two graphs are, in fact, isomorphic. By determining the maximum probability of successfully deceiving the verifier in a single round, you will uncover the fundamental limitation that defines the protocol's soundness error and appreciate why a single round is insufficient for a convincing proof .",

            "problem": "In the field of theoretical computer science, an interactive proof system allows a computationally powerful Prover to convince a computationally limited Verifier of the truth of a mathematical statement. Consider the following interactive protocol designed to prove that two graphs, $G_1$ and $G_2$, are non-isomorphic.\n\nThe Prover, Alice, claims to the Verifier, Bob, that two specific graphs, $G_1$ and $G_2$, are non-isomorphic. To convince Bob, they execute a single round of the following protocol:\n\n1.  **Bob's Step**: Bob chooses an index $i$ uniformly at random from the set $\\{1, 2\\}$. He then creates a new graph, $H$, by applying a random permutation to the vertex labels of his chosen graph $G_i$. This means that $H$ is isomorphic to $G_i$, but its vertex labels are scrambled. Bob sends only the graph $H$ to Alice.\n\n2.  **Alice's Step**: Alice receives the graph $H$. She is assumed to have unlimited computational power. She must determine which of the original graphs, $G_1$ or $G_2$, is isomorphic to $H$. She sends her answer, an index $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, back to Bob.\n\n3.  **Bob's Verification**: Bob checks if Alice's returned index $j$ matches his secretly chosen index $i$. If $j=i$, the round is successful. If $j \\neq i$, the round fails, and Bob rejects Alice's claim.\n\nNow, suppose Alice is attempting to cheat. In reality, the two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are actually isomorphic, a fact that Alice knows but Bob does not. Alice still claims the graphs are non-isomorphic and participates in the protocol, hoping to pass the verification step.\n\nWhat is the probability that Alice can successfully complete this single round of the protocol, assuming she employs the best possible strategy to determine her response $j$?\n\nA. 0\n\nB. $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nC. $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nD. $\\frac{3}{4}$\n\nE. 1",

Bob constructs $H=\\Pi(G_{I})$ and sends $H$ to Alice.\n\nBecause $G_{1} \\simeq G_{2}$, there exists a permutation $\\sigma \\in S_{n}$ such that $G_{2}=\\sigma(G_{1})$. For any labeled graph $h$ on $n$ vertices,\n$$\n\\Pr(H=h \\mid I=2)=\\Pr(\\Pi(G_{2})=h)=\\Pr(\\Pi(\\sigma(G_{1}))=h).\n$$\nDefining $\\Pi'=\\Pi \\circ \\sigma$, we have that $\\Pi'$ is uniformly distributed on $S_{n}$ whenever $\\Pi$ is, hence\n$$\n\\Pr(H=h \\mid I=2)=\\Pr(\\Pi'(G_{1})=h)=\\Pr(H=h \\mid I=1).\n$$\nTherefore the conditional distributions of $H$ given $I=1$ and $I=2$ are identical.

The strength of the graph non-isomorphism protocol, and many interactive proofs, comes from iteration. This next practice demonstrates how a verifier's confidence can be dramatically amplified by repeating the challenge-response cycle multiple times .

An engineer, Alice, presents her manager, Bob, with two large, complex network graphs, $G_1$ and $G_2$. Alice claims that these two graphs are non-isomorphic, a key requirement for her proposed security protocol.\n\nBob is skeptical.

Bob secretly and randomly chooses one of the two graphs, either $G_1$ or $G_2$, with equal probability.\n2.  He then generates a new graph, $H$, by randomly permuting the vertex labels of his chosen graph. This process ensures that $H$ is isomorphic to the graph he selected, but its structure is scrambled.\n3.  Bob presents only the graph $H$ to Alice.\n4.  Alice must then determine whether $H$ is isomorphic to $G_1$ or to $G_2$.\n\nAssume that if the graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are truly non-isomorphic, Alice's advanced system can correctly identify the origin of $H$ with 100% accuracy.
