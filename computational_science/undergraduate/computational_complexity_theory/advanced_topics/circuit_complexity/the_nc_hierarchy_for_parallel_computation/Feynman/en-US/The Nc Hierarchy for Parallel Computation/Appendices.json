The class $NC^0$ corresponds to problems solvable with constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits, where each output bit can only depend on a constant number of input bits.\n\nConsider the problem of converting an $n$-bit binary integer into its corresponding $n$-bit reflected binary code, also known as the Gray code. Let the input binary representation be $B = b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1b_0$ and the output Gray code be $G = g_{n-1}g_{n-2}...g_1g_0$.

The class $NC^{0}$ consists of functions computable by uniform families of constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with bounded fan-in, equivalently where each output bit depends on only $O(1)$ input bits.\n\nFor each $i$ with $0 \\leq i < n-1$, the output bit $g_{i}$ depends only on the two input bits $b_{i}$ and $b_{i+1}$, and for $i = n-1$ we have $g_{n-1}$ depending only on $b_{n-1}$. Thus each output bit depends on a constant number of inputs, independent of $n$. Moreover, each $g_{i}$ can be computed by a constant-depth bounded fan-in circuit over $\\{\\land,\\lor,\\neg\\}$, since the exclusive-or of two bits has the standard Boolean expression\n$$\nb_{i} \\oplus b_{i+1} \\;=\\; (b_{i} \\land \\neg b_{i+1}) \\;\\lor\\; (\\neg b_{i} \\land b_{i+1}).\n$$\nThis realization uses at most one layer of negations feeding a layer of binary $\\land$ gates, feeding a single binary $\\lor$ gate, giving constant depth (for example, depth $3$ with bounded fan-in $2$). The most significant bit $g_{n-1} = b_{n-1}$ is implemented by a wire. Therefore, computing all $n$ output bits in parallel yields a circuit of depth that is a fixed constant, independent of $n$, and of size $O(n)$, which is polynomial in $n$.\n\nRegarding uniformity, the wiring pattern is completely regular: for each $i$, the gates for $g_{i}$ connect only to $b_{i}$ and $b_{i+1}$ (or to $b_{n-1}$ alone when $i = n-1$). Hence a standard uniformity condition (such as DLOGTIME-uniformity) is satisfied, because a deterministic Turing machine can, given $n$ and gate indices encoded in binary, compute the connections in time $O(\\log n)$.\n\nThus the conversion mapping is computable by a uniform family of constant-depth, polynomial-size, bounded fan-in Boolean circuits in which each output bit depends on $O(1)$ input bits. Therefore the problem is in $NC^{0}$. Since $NC^{0} \\subseteq NC^{1} \\subseteq NC^{2} \\subseteq \\dots$, the most precise classification among the given options is that it is in $NC^{0}$.",

Since at most one $M[i]$ equals $1$, these OR-reductions simply select the bits of that unique index; if all $M[i]=0$, then all $B[b]=0$, representing $0$. Each $B[b]$ is an OR over $n$ terms of fan-in $2$ OR gates arranged in a balanced binary tree, giving depth $O(\\log n)$.
