This exercise explores the consequences of that single difference in the simplest setting: $2 \\times 2$ matrices. By finding all binary matrices where these two values coincide, you will build a concrete intuition for their relationship and see firsthand why they are not the same function. This practice is foundational, as $0-1$ matrices are central to the permanent's role in counting perfect matchings in graphs .",

The connectivity of these graphs can be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A$ where each entry $a_{ij}$ is either $0$ or $1$. An entry of $1$ represents a connection, while a $0$ represents its absence.\n\nGiven such a matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$, two important functions are defined:\n1.  The determinant of the matrix, given by $\\det(A) = ad - bc$.\n2.  The permanent of the matrix, a related function given by $\\text{perm}(A) = ad + bc$.

The equation $2bc=0$ over the integers holds if and only if $bc=0$. Therefore the condition is exactly that not both $b$ and $c$ are $1$.\n\nTo count such matrices, choose $(b,c)$ with $bc=0$. There are $3$ such pairs: $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$. For each choice of $(b,c)$, the entries $a$ and $d$ are free and can each be $0$ or $1$, giving $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possibilities. Hence the total number is\n$$\n3 \\times 4 = 12.\n$$\nEquivalently, from all $2^{4}=16$ matrices, exclude those with $b=c=1$ (there are $4$ of these, since $a$ and $d$ are free), yielding $16-4=12$.",

You may recall from linear algebra that the determinant of a triangular matrix is simply the product of its diagonal entries.

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the permanent of a matrix is a function that is computationally difficult to evaluate in general, unlike the determinant. This problem explores a special case. The permanent of an $n \\times n$ matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ is defined by the formula:\n$$\n\\text{perm}(A) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma(i)}\n$$\nwhere $S_n$ is the set of all permutations of the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nConsider the following $4 \\times 4$ upper triangular matrix $M$:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix}\nm_{11}  m_{12}  m_{13}  m_{14} \\\\\n0  m_{22}  m_{23}  m_{24} \\\\\n0  0  m_{33}  m_{34} \\\\\n0  0  0  m_{44}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere the entries $m_{ij}$ for $i \\le j$ are arbitrary non-zero values, and all entries $m_{ij}$ for $i  j$ are zero.\n\nUsing the definition provided, compute the permanent of the matrix $M$.
