This initial exercise focuses on the core components of a Unique Game: the variables (vertices), the set of possible values (alphabet), and the critical permutation constraints that make the game \"unique\". By working through the construction of a simple, perfectly satisfiable instance, you will build a solid foundation for understanding how these games are structured and why the permutation rule is so important .",

            "solution": "By definition, a Unique Game instance $(V,E,[k],\\{\\pi_{e}\\}_{e \\in E})$ must have each edge constraint $\\pi_{e}:[k]\\to[k]$ be a permutation (bijection).

The constraint on $e=\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}$ is $\\pi(x)=1-x$. Over $[2]$, $\\pi(0)=1$ and $\\pi(1)=0$, so $\\pi$ is a bijection and hence a valid permutation. To check perfect satisfiability, define a labeling $L$ by picking any $a\\in[2]$ and setting $L(v_{1})=a$ and $L(v_{2})=\\pi(a)$.

Even if we consider such an edge, satisfaction requires $L(v_{1})=\\pi(L(v_{1}))$, i.e., $L(v_{1})=1-L(v_{1})$.

A Unique Game instance is defined by a tuple $(G, \\Sigma, \\{\\pi_e\\})$, where:\n1.  $G = (V, E)$ is a directed graph with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$. For every directed edge $(u,v) \\in E$, its reversal $(v,u)$ is also in $E$.\n2.  $\\Sigma$ is a finite set of labels, called the alphabet.\n3.

A constraint for an edge $e = (u,v)$ is satisfied by a labeling $L$ if $\\pi_e(L(u)) = L(v)$. The *value* of a Unique Game instance is the maximum possible fraction of satisfied constraints over all possible labelings.\n\nConsider a simple Unique Game instance constructed on an undirected triangle graph, which we can represent with directed edges for the constraints. Let the vertices be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ and the alphabet be $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$.

            "problem": "Consider a unique game defined on the vertices of a 3-dimensional hypercube, $Q_3$. The vertices of $Q_3$ are represented by binary strings of length 3, i.e., the vertex set is $V = \\{ (v_1, v_2, v_3) \\mid v_i \\in \\{0,1\\} \\}$. An edge exists between two vertices if and only if their binary representations differ in exactly one coordinate. The set of all edges, $E$, which has size 12, is partitioned into three subsets $E_1, E_2, E_3$, where $E_i$ contains all edges connecting vertices that differ in the $i$-th coordinate. Each subset $E_i$ contains 4 edges.\n\nIn this game, a variable $x_v$ from the alphabet $\\Sigma=\\{0,1\\}$ is assigned to each vertex $v \\in V$. The constraints of the game depend on the dimension of the edge connecting two variables:\n- For any edge $(u,v) \\in E_1 \\cup E_2$, the constraint is one of equality: $x_u = x_v$.\n- For any edge $(u,v) \\in E_3$, the constraint is one of inequality: $x_u \\neq x_v$.\n\nAn assignment is a function $A: V \\to \\{0,1\\}$ mapping each vertex to a value in $\\Sigma$. For an assignment to be considered valid, it must satisfy an additional global parity constraint: the sum of the values assigned to all 8 vertices must be an odd number.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal value of this game, which is defined as the maximum possible fraction of satisfied constraints over all valid assignments. Express your answer as a single fraction in its simplest form.",
            "solution": "Let $Q_{3}$ have vertex set $V=\\{(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3})\\mid v_{i}\\in\\{0,1\\}\\}$ and edge set $E=E_{1}\\cup E_{2}\\cup E_{3}$, where $E_{i}$ consists of edges differing in coordinate $i$. The constraints are:\n- For $(u,v)\\in E_{1}\\cup E_{2}$: $x_{u}=x_{v}$, i.e., $x_{u}+x_{v}=0$ modulo $2$.\n- For $(u,v)\\in E_{3}$: $x_{u}\\neq x_{v}$, i.e., $x_{u}+x_{v}=1$ modulo $2$.\n\nThere are assignments that satisfy all edge constraints: take $x_{(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3})}=v_{3}$. Then $x$ is independent of $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, so all edges in $E_{1}\\cup E_{2}$ satisfy equality, and along $E_{3}$, values differ so inequality holds. However, this assignment has total sum $4\\cdot 0+4\\cdot 1=4$, which is even, hence it violates the global parity requirement that the sum over all $8$ vertices be odd. Thus no assignment can satisfy all $12$ edge constraints subject to the parity constraint.\n\nFix such a fully satisfying assignment $a_{v}=v_{3}$ as a reference. For any assignment $x$, define $y_{v}=x_{v}+a_{v}$ modulo $2$ and let $S=\\{v\\in V: y_{v}=1\\}$. For any edge $(u,v)$ with required parity $r\\in\\{0,1\\}$, since $a$ satisfies $a_{u}+a_{v}=r$, we have that $x$ satisfies the edge iff\n$$\nx_{u}+x_{v}=r \\iff (a_{u}+y_{u})+(a_{v}+y_{v})=r \\iff y_{u}+y_{v}=0,\n$$\ni.e., iff $y_{u}=y_{v}$. Therefore, an edge is violated by $x$ if and only if it has exactly one endpoint in $S$. Hence, the number of violated edges is precisely the size of the edge cut between $S$ and $V\\setminus S$, denoted $b(S)$.\n\nThe parity of $x$ is\n$$\n\\sum_{v} x_{v}=\\sum_{v} a_{v}+\\sum_{v} y_{v} \\pmod{2}.\n$$\nSince $\\sum_{v} a_{v}$ is even, the global parity constraint that $\\sum_{v} x_{v}$ be odd is equivalent to $|S|$ being odd.\n\nThus, maximizing the number of satisfied constraints is equivalent to minimizing $b(S)$ over all odd-cardinality subsets $S\\subseteq V$, and then the number of satisfied edges is $12-b(S)$.\n\nIn the $3$-cube, each vertex has degree $3$, and for any subset $S$,\n$$\nb(S)=3|S|-2e(S),\n$$\nwhere $e(S)$ is the number of edges with both endpoints in $S$. To minimize $b(S)$ for odd $|S|$, we consider possible sizes:\n\n- If $|S|=1$, then $e(S)=0$ and $b(S)=3$.\n- If $|S|=3$, the cube has no triangles, so the maximum $e(S)$ is $2$ (a path of length $2$), yielding $b(S)=3\\cdot 3-2\\cdot 2=5$.\n- By complement symmetry, $|S|=5$ has the same minimum boundary as $|S|=3$, i.e., $5$.\n- If $|S|=7$, then $b(S)=b(V\\setminus S)=b$ for a singleton, hence $b(S)=3$.\n\nMoreover, since $b(S)\\equiv 3|S| \\pmod{2}$, any odd $|S|$ gives $b(S)$ odd, so $b(S)\\geq 3$. Therefore, the minimal possible boundary for odd $|S|$ is $3$, achieved by $|S|=1$ (or $|S|=7$).\n\nConsequently, the minimum number of violated edges is $3$, so the maximum number of satisfied edges is $12-3=9$, and the optimal fraction of satisfied constraints is\n$$\n\\frac{9}{12}=\\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\nThis is achieved, for example, by taking the fully satisfying assignment $x_{v}=v_{3}$ and flipping the value at any single vertex, which makes the global parity odd while violating exactly the $3$ edges incident to that vertex.",
