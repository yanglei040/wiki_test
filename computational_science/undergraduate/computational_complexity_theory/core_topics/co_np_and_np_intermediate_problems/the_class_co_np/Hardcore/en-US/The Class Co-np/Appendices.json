            "solution": "To determine the complexity of the `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` problem, we will analyze its properties with respect to the complexity classes P, NP, and co-NP.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the problem. The question asks if a property (\"passes through a forbidden vertex\") holds for *every* path from $s$ to $t$. Problems with this universal quantifier (\"for all...\") are often candidates for the class co-NP.\n\nA decision problem is in the class **co-NP** if its complement is in the class **NP**. Let's define the complement of `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION`. The original problem asks if ALL $s-t$ paths are \"obstructed\". A \"no\" answer to this question means that it is *not* true that all paths are obstructed. This is equivalent to saying that there *exists at least one* $s-t$ path that is *not* obstructed.\n\nLet's call this complement problem `AVOIDING-PATH`.\n- **Instance:** $\\langle G, s, t, F \\rangle$\n- **Question:** Does there exist a path from $s$ to $t$ that does not pass through any vertex in the set $F$?\n\nNow, let's determine if `AVOIDING-PATH` is in NP. A problem is in NP if a \"yes\" answer can be verified in polynomial time given a suitable certificate.\nFor `AVOIDING-PATH`, a certificate for a \"yes\" instance would be the path itself. Let's say the path is $p = (v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_k)$.\nA polynomial-time verifier can check the following:\n1.  The path starts at $s$ and ends at $t$: check if $v_0 = s$ and $v_k = t$.\n2.  The path is valid in $G$: for each $i \\in \\{0, \\ldots, k-1\\}$, check if the edge $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ exists in $E$.\n3.  The path avoids all forbidden vertices: for each vertex $v_i$ in the path, check that $v_i \\notin F$.\n\nThe length of such a path is at most $|V|$, so the certificate size is polynomial in the input size. Each of the verification steps can be performed in polynomial time. Thus, `AVOIDING-PATH` is in NP.\n\nSince the complement of `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is in NP, by definition, **`UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is in co-NP**. This means option **C** is correct.\n\nNow, let's investigate if the problem belongs to a more restrictive class, namely P. A problem is in P if it can be solved by a deterministic algorithm in polynomial time. Let's reconsider the `AVOIDING-PATH` problem. We can devise a direct algorithm to solve it.\n\n**Algorithm for `AVOIDING-PATH`:**\n1.  Construct a new graph $G'$ by removing all forbidden vertices from $G$. The set of vertices in $G'$ is $V' = V \\setminus F$. The set of edges $E'$ consists of all edges $(u,v) \\in E$ such that both $u$ and $v$ are in $V'$.\n2.  The problem `AVOIDING-PATH` is now equivalent to asking if there is a path from $s$ to $t$ in the graph $G'$.\n3.  This is a standard graph reachability problem. Before we solve it, we must first check if $s$ or $t$ were removed. If $s \\in F$ or $t \\in F$, then no path consisting entirely of non-forbidden vertices can exist, so the answer to `AVOIDING-PATH` is \"no\".\n4.  If $s \\notin F$ and $t \\notin F$, we can run a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from $s$ on the graph $G'$. If the search reaches $t$, an avoiding path exists. If the search finishes without reaching $t$, no such path exists.\n\nThe construction of $G'$ and the execution of BFS/DFS both take polynomial time (specifically, $O(|V| + |E|)$). Therefore, `AVOIDING-PATH` is in P.\n\nThe class P is closed under complementation (i.e., if a language $L$ is in P, then its complement $\\bar{L}$ is also in P). Since `AVOIDING-PATH` is in P, its complement, **`UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION`, must also be in P**. This means option **A** is correct.\n\nNow we can evaluate all the options:\n- **A. `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is in P.** This is **correct**, as we have demonstrated a polynomial-time algorithm for it.\n- **B. `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is in NP.** This is **correct**. Any problem in P is also in NP (P $\\subseteq$ NP). A polynomial-time decider for the problem can also act as a verifier that ignores the certificate.\n- **C. `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is in co-NP.** This is also **correct**. Any problem in P is also in co-NP (P $\\subseteq$ co-NP). We also showed this directly by proving its complement is in NP.\n- **D. `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is NP-complete.** This is **incorrect**. A problem in P can only be NP-complete if P=NP. The problem statement allows us to assume P $\\neq$ NP.\n- **E. `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is co-NP-complete.** This is **incorrect**. A problem in P can only be co-NP-complete if P=co-NP. Since P $\\subseteq$ co-NP, this would again imply P=co-NP. Given our assumption, this is false.\n- **F. `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is not in NP.** This is **incorrect**, as it is in P and thus in NP.\n- **G. `UNIVERSAL-OBSTRUCTION` is not in co-NP.** This is **incorrect**, as it is in P and thus in co-NP.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A, B, and C.",

            "problem": "You are a junior software engineer on a quality assurance team for a company that designs custom logic circuits. The design team provides the functional specification of a circuit as a Boolean formula. Your task is to write a verification program that checks if a circuit's output is *always* logically true, regardless of the inputs. This property is crucial for safety-critical applications.\n\nThe formulas are provided in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). A brief review of the terminology is as follows:\n- A *variable* is a symbol, like $x_1$, that can be either true or false.\n- A *literal* is either a variable ($x_i$) or its negation ($\\neg x_i$).\n- A *term* is a conjunction (AND, denoted by $\\land$) of one or more literals. For example, $(x_1 \\land \\neg x_2 \\land x_3)$ is a term.\n- A formula in **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)** is a disjunction (OR, denoted by $\\lor$) of one or more terms. For example, $(x_1 \\land \\neg x_2) \\lor (\\neg x_1 \\land x_3)$ is a formula in DNF.\n- A *tautology* is a Boolean formula that evaluates to true for every possible assignment of truth values to its variables.\n\nThe problem of determining if an arbitrary DNF formula is a tautology is known as the DNF-TAUTOLOGY problem. To properly design your verification software and estimate its performance limitations, you need to understand its computational complexity.\n\nWhat is the most specific (i.e., smallest) well-known complexity class from the list below that is guaranteed to contain the DNF-TAUTOLOGY problem?\n\nA.

            "solution": "Let a DNF formula be written as $F=\\bigvee_{i=1}^{k} T_{i}$ where each term $T_{i}$ is a conjunction of literals, $T_{i}=\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{m_{i}} \\ell_{ij}$. Using De Morgan’s laws and distributivity of negation over Boolean connectives, we have\n$$\n\\neg F \\;=\\; \\neg\\left(\\bigvee_{i=1}^{k} T_{i}\\right) \\;=\\; \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{k} \\neg T_{i}, \n\\qquad\n\\neg T_{i} \\;=\\; \\neg\\left(\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{m_{i}} \\ell_{ij}\\right) \\;=\\; \\bigvee_{j=1}^{m_{i}} \\neg \\ell_{ij}.\n$$\nHence $\\neg F$ is a CNF formula with exactly $k$ clauses, and the size of $\\neg F$ is linear in the size of $F$.\n\n$F$ is a tautology if and only if $\\neg F$ is unsatisfiable:\n$$\nF \\text{ is tautological} \\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\; \\forall a,\\; F(a)=\\text{true} \\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\; \\neg\\exists a,\\; \\neg F(a)=\\text{true} \\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\; \\neg F \\text{ is unsatisfiable}.\n$$\nTherefore, DNF-TAUTOLOGY is polynomial-time many-one equivalent to CNF-UNSAT. Since CNF-UNSAT is co-NP-complete (as the complement of SAT, which is NP-complete), it follows that DNF-TAUTOLOGY is co-NP-hard.\n\nMembership in co-NP holds because the complement problem (DNF non-tautology) admits a polynomial-time verifiable certificate: an assignment $a$ such that $F(a)=\\text{false}$. Given $a$, one can in polynomial time verify that every term $T_{i}$ evaluates to false (equivalently, for each $i$ there exists a literal in $T_{i}$ falsified by $a$), hence $F(a)=\\text{false}$.\n\nThus DNF-TAUTOLOGY is co-NP-complete, so among the listed classes, the smallest class that is guaranteed to contain it is co-NP.",

Given such $\\mathbf{x}$, verification consists of:\n- checking $L_{i} \\leq x_{i} \\leq U_{i}$ for all $i$, which is straightforward in time polynomial in the input size,\n- evaluating $P(\\mathbf{x})$ exactly and testing equality to $0$. Since $P$ is specified by a list of monomials with integer coefficients and exponents, one can compute each monomial $a \\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{e_{i}}$ using fast exponentiation (repeated squaring) and integer multiplication and then sum them; equality to $0$ is then a simple integer comparison. Therefore a purported root $\\mathbf{x}$ can be verified in time polynomial in the input size. Hence EXISTS_ROOT is in NP, and SAFE_REGION is in co-NP.\n\nStep 2 (co-NP-hardness): We reduce UNSAT to SAFE_REGION. Let $F$ be a CNF formula on Boolean variables $y_{1},\\dots,y_{n}$ with clauses $C_{1},\\dots,C_{m}$. For each variable $y_{i}$ introduce an integer variable $x_{i}$ and constrain the domain to the integer box $[0,1]^{n}$, so the only integer points are $\\{0,1\\}^{n}$. For each literal, define its polynomial encoding:\n- if the literal is $y_{i}$, set $\\ell(x_{i}) = x_{i}$,\n- if the literal is $\\neg y_{i}$, set $\\ell(x_{i}) = 1 - x_{i}$.\nFor a clause $C_{j}$ with literals $\\ell_{j1},\\ell_{j2},\\ell_{j3}$, define\n$$\nf_{j}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\bigl(1 - \\ell_{j1}(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr)\\bigl(1 - \\ell_{j2}(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr)\\bigl(1 - \\ell_{j3}(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr).\n$$\nFor $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n}$, $f_{j}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ if and only if clause $C_{j}$ is satisfied by the assignment $\\mathbf{x}$; if $C_{j}$ is falsified, then $f_{j}(\\mathbf{x}) = 1$. Define a single polynomial\n$$\nP_{F}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\bigl(f_{j}(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr)^{2}.\n$$\nOn $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n}$, each term $\\bigl(f_{j}(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr)^{2} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and\n$$\nP_{F}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad f_{j}(\\mathbf{x}) = 0 \\text{ for all } j \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\text{every clause is satisfied} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad F \\text{ is satisfiable}.\n$$\nThus, for the box $[0,1]^{n}$,\n$$\n\\forall \\mathbf{x} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n},\\; P_{F}(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad F \\text{ is unsatisfiable}.\n$$\nThe mapping $F \\mapsto (P_{F},[0,1]^{n})$ is computable in time polynomial in the size of $F$.
