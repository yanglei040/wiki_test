The accelerator's state is determined by three Boolean configuration flags, represented by variables $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. For the accelerator to function correctly, two primary modules must both be operational. The operational condition for the first module is expressed by the logical clause $(x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor \\neg x_3)$, and for the second module, by $(\\neg x_1 \\lor \\neg x_2 \\lor x_3)$. Thus, the entire system's validity is captured by the single 3-Conjunctive Normal Form (3-CNF) formula $\\phi$:\n\n$$ \\phi = (x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor \\neg x_3) \\land (\\neg x_1 \\lor \\neg x_2 \\lor x_3) $$\n\nTo analyze this constraint satisfaction problem, the team decides to convert it into an instance of the CLIQUE problem using the standard polynomial-time reduction from 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT). In the CLIQUE problem, the goal is to determine if a given graph $G$ contains a clique of a specified size $k$. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are connected by an edge.\n\nYour task is to apply this standard reduction to the formula $\\phi$. This involves constructing an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ and determining an integer $k$ such that $\\phi$ is satisfiable if and only if $G$ has a clique of size $k$.

This reduction transforms a given 3-Conjunctive Normal Form (3CNF) formula $\\phi$ into a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, such that $\\phi$ is satisfiable if and only if $G$ contains a clique of size $k$.\n\nThe construction of the graph $G=(V, E)$ from a 3CNF formula $\\phi = C_1 \\land C_2 \\land \\dots \\land C_m$ is as follows:\n1.  **Vertices (V):** For each clause $C_j = (l_{j,1} \\lor l_{j,2} \\lor l_{j,3})$ in $\\phi$, create a distinct vertex for each literal occurrence. This means if a literal is repeated within a clause, it will correspond to multiple, separate vertices. Each vertex can be thought of as being labeled with its corresponding literal and the index of its originating clause.\n2.  **Edges (E):** An undirected edge is created between two vertices, say $u$ and $v$, if and only if both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n    a.
