            "introduction": "To begin, let's ground our understanding with a fundamental case. This exercise tasks you with designing a straightforward algorithm to determine if a graph contains a clique of a fixed, small size—specifically, a 3-clique, often pictured as a triangle of interconnected nodes. By analyzing its performance, you'll gain a concrete understanding of polynomial-time complexity and establish a baseline for appreciating why the general clique problem is considered computationally hard.",

A $k$-clique in such a graph is a subset of $k$ vertices where every two distinct vertices in the subset are connected by an edge. In the context of a social network, a 3-clique represents a group of three individuals who all mutually know each other.\n\nYou are tasked with analyzing the computational cost of finding such a group. Consider a graph $G$ with a set of $n$ vertices. The structure of the graph is provided to you in the form of an adjacency matrix, $A$, where the entry $A[i][j]$ is 1 if an edge exists between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nDesign an algorithm to solve the 3-CLIQUE problem, which is the problem of determining whether the graph $G$ contains at least one 3-clique. Based on your algorithm, determine its worst-case time complexity as a function of the number of vertices, $n$. Express your answer using Big O notation.",

The problem of finding the maximum clique (the largest possible clique in a graph) is known to be computationally difficult. However, heuristic algorithms can quickly find a clique that is large, though not necessarily of maximum size.\n\nConsider an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with the vertex set $V = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\\}$ and the edge set $E$ containing the following 16 edges:\n$E = \\{\\{A,B\\}, \\{A,E\\}, \\{A,F\\}, \\{A,H\\}, \\{B,D\\}, \\{B,E\\}, \\{B,F\\}, \\{B,H\\}, \\{C,G\\}, \\{C,H\\}, \\{D,E\\}, \\{D,F\\}, \\{D,H\\}, \\{E,G\\}, \\{E,H\\}, \\{G,H\\}\\}$.\n\nYou are to find a clique in this graph by applying the following greedy algorithm:\n\n1.
