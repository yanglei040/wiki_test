            "introduction": "The most basic question in graph coloring is whether a graph can be colored with just two colors. This problem, known as 2-coloring, is equivalent to determining if a graph is bipartite, and it stands out as one of the few coloring problems that can be solved efficiently. This exercise  frames this concept within a practical scenario of processor scheduling, guiding you to test for 2-colorability by identifying the fundamental obstruction: an odd-length cycle.",

            "problem": "A team of engineers is designing a specialized processor with seven distinct functional units, labeled U1 through U7. Certain pairs of these units cannot operate simultaneously within the same clock cycle because they compete for a shared internal bus. The engineers' goal is to implement a simple two-phase clocking scheme, where each unit is assigned to either \"Phase 1\" or \"Phase 2\". Units that conflict with each other must be assigned to different phases. If such an assignment is possible, the scheme is viable.\n\nThe conflict graph for the functional units is defined as follows: each unit is a vertex, and an edge connects two vertices if the corresponding units conflict. The conflicts are:\n- U1 conflicts with U2 and U3.\n- U2 conflicts with U1 and U4.\n- U3 conflicts with U1 and U5.\n- U4 conflicts with U2 and U6.\n- U5 conflicts with U3 and U7.\n- U6 conflicts with U4 and U7.\n- U7 conflicts with U5 and U6.\n\nBased on this set of conflicts, is the proposed two-phase clocking scheme possible?\n\nA. Yes, it is possible.\nB. No, it is not possible.",
            "solution": "We model the assignment of units to two phases as a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V=\\{U_{1},U_{2},U_{3},U_{4},U_{5},U_{6},U_{7}\\}$ and edges $E$ given by the conflicts:\n$$\n\\{(U_{1},U_{2}),(U_{1},U_{3}),(U_{2},U_{4}),(U_{3},U_{5}),(U_{4},U_{6}),(U_{5},U_{7}),(U_{6},U_{7})\\}.\n$$\nA two-phase assignment is equivalent to a proper $2$-coloring of $G$, i.e., a function $c:V\\to\\{1,2\\}$ such that $c(u)\\neq c(v)$ for every edge $(u,v)\\in E$. A graph is $2$-colorable (bipartite) if and only if it has no cycle of odd length.\n\nWe exhibit an odd cycle in $G$. Consider the sequence of vertices\n$$\nU_{1}\\to U_{2}\\to U_{4}\\to U_{6}\\to U_{7}\\to U_{5}\\to U_{3}\\to U_{1}.\n$$\nEach consecutive pair is an edge in $E$: $(U_{1},U_{2})$, $(U_{2},U_{4})$, $(U_{4},U_{6})$, $(U_{6},U_{7})$, $(U_{7},U_{5})$, $(U_{5},U_{3})$, and $(U_{3},U_{1})$. This forms a cycle of length $7$, which is odd.\n\nBy the characterization of bipartite graphs, this odd cycle implies $G$ is not bipartite, hence no $2$-coloring exists. For completeness, we can derive a direct contradiction: suppose a coloring $c:V\\to\\{1,2\\}$ exists and set $c(U_{1})=1$ without loss of generality. Then, along the above cycle,\n$$\nc(U_{2})=2,\\quad c(U_{4})=1,\\quad c(U_{6})=2,\\quad c(U_{7})=1,\\quad c(U_{5})=2,\\quad c(U_{3})=1.\n$$\nBut the edge $(U_{3},U_{1})$ requires $c(U_{3})\\neq c(U_{1})$, contradicting $c(U_{3})=c(U_{1})=1$. Therefore, no two-phase assignment satisfying all conflicts is possible.",

            "introduction": "While the presence of a triangle (a $K_3$ subgraph) obviously forces a graph to need at least three colors, is it the only structure that does so? This exercise  challenges this simple intuition, asking you to find a graph that is triangle-free yet still has a chromatic number of 3. Solving this problem reveals a deeper principle: odd cycles are fundamental obstructions to 2-colorability, demonstrating that the need for more colors can arise from global structure, not just local density.",

The **chromatic number** of a graph $G$, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a valid vertex coloring.

A cycle $C_{n}$ has no triangles unless $n=3$, so $C_{5}$ is triangle-free. To determine $\\chi(G_{A})$, note that a graph is $2$-colorable if and only if it is bipartite. A cycle is bipartite if and only if its length is even. Since $5$ is odd, $C_{5}$ is not bipartite, hence not $2$-colorable. It is $3$-colorable, for example by assigning colors $a,b,a,b,c$ to $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4},v_{5}$ respectively, which gives a proper coloring. Therefore $\\chi(G_{A})=3$, and $G_{A}$ is triangle-free.\n\nGraph $G_{B}$ is the $6$-cycle $C_{6}$. It is triangle-free because the only cycles present have length $6$.

It contains a triangle by definition, so it is not triangle-free. Its chromatic number is $\\chi(G_{C})=3$, but this fails the triangle-free condition.\n\nGraph $G_{D}$ is the path $P_{5}$. Paths are bipartite, hence triangle-free and $2$-colorable, so $\\chi(G_{D})=2\\neq 3$.\n\nTherefore, the only graph that is both triangle-free and has chromatic number $3$ is $G_{A}$.",

            "introduction": "Finding the exact chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of a general graph is an NP-hard problem, meaning no efficient algorithm is known for all cases. In practice, we often turn to fast heuristics like the greedy coloring algorithm. This exercise  brilliantly demonstrates a crucial limitation of this common approach, showing how a carefully chosen vertex ordering can lead the algorithm to use a number of colors far from the optimal minimum. This practice illuminates the important distinction between finding *any* valid coloring and finding an *optimal* one, a central theme in the study of computational complexity.",

            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, the graph coloring problem is a central topic. A common heuristic to find a coloring for a graph is the greedy coloring algorithm.\n\nThe greedy coloring algorithm works as follows: Given a simple graph $G=(V, E)$ and a predetermined ordering of its vertices $\\sigma = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n)$, the algorithm processes the vertices one by one according to this order. For each vertex $v_i$, it assigns the smallest positive integer (color) that has not already been assigned to any of its neighbors that appear before it in the ordering $\\sigma$. This smallest available color is formally known as the minimum excluded value or 'mex' of the set of its neighbors' colors.\n\nConsider a simple graph $G$ constructed with a set of 14 vertices, $V = \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_7\\} \\cup \\{b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_7\\}$. The edge set $E$ is defined such that an edge exists between vertex $a_i$ and vertex $b_j$ if and only if their indices are different, i.e., $i \\neq j$. There are no edges between any two 'a' vertices or any two 'b' vertices.\n\nThe vertices of this graph are processed using the specific ordering $\\sigma = (a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3, a_4, b_4, a_5, b_5, a_6, b_6, a_7, b_7)$.\n\nHow many distinct colors does the greedy coloring algorithm use for the graph $G$ with the specified vertex ordering $\\sigma$?",

There are no edges among the $a$-vertices nor among the $b$-vertices. Let the vertex order be $\\sigma=(a_{1},b_{1},a_{2},b_{2},\\dots,a_{7},b_{7})$. The greedy algorithm assigns to each vertex $v$ the color\n$$\nc(v)=\\operatorname{mex}\\big(\\{c(u): u\\in N(v)\\cap \\text{(previous vertices in }\\sigma)\\}\\big),\n$$\nwhere $N(v)$ is the neighbor set of $v$.\n\nProcess the vertices in order:\n- For $a_{1}$, no neighbors have appeared yet, so the forbidden set is empty and $c(a_{1})=1$.\n- For $b_{1}$, its neighbors are $a_{i}$ with $i\\neq 1$, but among previously processed vertices only $a_{1}$ exists and $a_{1}$ is not adjacent to $b_{1}$. Thus the forbidden set is empty and $c(b_{1})=1$.\n\nWe claim inductively that for each $k$ with $1\\leq k\\leq 7$,\n$$\nc(a_{k})=k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c(b_{k})=k.\n$$\nThe base case $k=1$ holds as shown. Assume it holds for all $t$ with $1\\leq t\\leq k-1$. Consider $a_{k}$. Its neighbors among previously processed vertices are exactly $b_{1},\\dots,b_{k-1}$ (since $b_{j}$ is adjacent to $a_{k}$ for all $j\\neq k$ and only $b_{1},\\dots,b_{k-1}$ have appeared). By the induction hypothesis, $c(b_{j})=j$ for $1\\leq j\\leq k-1$.

Among the previously processed $a$-vertices are $a_{1},\\dots,a_{k}$, but $a_{k}$ is not adjacent to $b_{k}$. Therefore the neighbors of $b_{k}$ that have appeared are $a_{1},\\dots,a_{k-1}$, which by the induction hypothesis have colors $1,2,\\dots,k-1$. Thus the forbidden colors for $b_{k}$ are $\\{1,2,\\dots,k-1\\}$ and\n$$\nc(b_{k})=\\operatorname{mex}(\\{1,2,\\dots,k-1\\})=k.\n$$\nBy induction, for all $k\\in\\{1,\\dots,7\\}$ we have $c(a_{k})=k$ and $c(b_{k})=k$. Therefore the greedy algorithm uses exactly the colors $\\{1,2,\\dots,7\\}$, i.e., $7$ distinct colors.",
