            "problem": "A computer science student is investigating the Subset-Sum problem, which asks if a non-empty subset of a given set of integers sums to a specific target value. The student implements a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1.  Start with an empty solution subset and the initial target value, $T$.\n2.  From the set of available integers, $S$, select the largest integer that is less than or equal to the remaining target value.\n3.  Add this integer to the solution subset and subtract its value from the remaining target.\n4.  Remove the selected integer from the available set $S$.\n5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until the remaining target value is zero (a solution is found) or no more integers can be selected (the algorithm fails).\n\nThe student tests this algorithm on the set of integers $S = \\{10, 7, 6, 5\\}$ with a target value $T = 12$. The greedy algorithm fails to find a solution. However, a valid subset that sums to $T$ does exist.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the correct subset of $S = \\{10, 7, 6, 5\\}$ that sums to the target $T = 12$. We are told that a specific greedy algorithm fails to find this solution. Let's first trace the execution of the greedy algorithm to understand why it fails, and then we will check the given options to find the correct solution.\n\nFirst, let's trace the greedy algorithm described.\nThe set of integers is $S = \\{10, 7, 6, 5\\}$ and the target is $T = 12$. The integers in $S$ are already sorted in descending order, which is convenient for the greedy selection process.\n\nStep 1: The current target is 12. The largest integer in $S$ is 10. Since $10 \\le 12$, the algorithm selects 10.\n- The partial solution subset is now $\\{10\\}$.\n- The remaining target value becomes $12 - 10 = 2$.\n- The set of available integers becomes $\\{7, 6, 5\\}$.\n\nStep 2: The current target is 2. The available integers are $\\{7, 6, 5\\}$.\n- The largest available integer is 7. Since $7 > 2$, it cannot be chosen.\n- The next largest available integer is 6. Since $6 > 2$, it cannot be chosen.\n- The next largest available integer is 5. Since $5 > 2$, it cannot be chosen.\n\nStep 3: There are no integers left in the available set that are less than or equal to the remaining target of 2. The algorithm terminates without reducing the target to 0. The greedy approach only found the subset $\\{10\\}$, which sums to 10, not 12. Thus, the greedy algorithm fails, as stated in the problem.\n\nNow, we need to find the correct subset. We can do this by examining the provided multiple-choice options.\n\nA. The subset is $\\{10\\}$. The sum of its elements is 10. This is not equal to the target $T = 12$.\n\nB. The subset is $\\{7, 6\\}$. The sum of its elements is $7 + 6 = 13$. This is not equal to the target $T = 12$.\n\nC. The subset is $\\{7, 5\\}$. The sum of its elements is $7 + 5 = 12$. This is equal to the target $T = 12$. This is a valid solution.\n\nD. The subset is $\\{5, 6\\}$. The sum of its elements is $5 + 6 = 11$. This is not equal to the target $T = 12$.\n\nE. This option claims that no such subset exists. This is false, because we found a valid subset in option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct subset of $S$ that sums to $T=12$ is $\\{7, 5\\}$.",

In its general form, SUBSET-SUM is NP-complete, meaning there is no known algorithm that can solve every instance of the problem in time that is polynomial in the input size, and it is considered among the hardest problems in the class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time).\n\nConsider a special variant of this problem where the set $S$ contains only distinct, non-negative powers of two.

            "problem": "The SUBSET-SUM problem is a classic question in computer science: given a set of non-negative integers $S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n\\}$ and a target integer sum $t$, determine if there exists a non-empty subset of $S$ whose elements sum to exactly $t$.\n\nA standard approach to solve this problem is using Dynamic Programming (DP). We can construct a two-dimensional boolean table, let's call it `P`, of size $(n+1) \\times (t+1)$. An entry `P[i][j]` is `true` if a sum `j` can be formed using a subset of the first `i` elements $\\{s_1, \\ldots, s_i\\}$, and `false` otherwise. The table is filled using the recurrence relation:\n`P[i][j] = P[i-1][j] OR P[i-1][j - s_i]`\n(where the second term is only considered if $j \\ge s_i$). The base cases are typically `P[0][0] = true` and `P[0][j] = false` for $j > 0$. The final answer to the problem is given by `P[n][t]`.\n\nAnalyze the space complexity of this standard algorithm and the logic behind optimizing it. Consider the following statements:\n\nI. The space complexity of the standard two-dimensional dynamic programming algorithm described above is $O(n \\cdot t)$.\nII. The space complexity can be optimized to $O(n + t)$ by noticing that only the previous column's values are needed.\nIII. The space optimization is possible because the calculation for any state `(i, j)` (using the first `i` elements to form sum `j`) only depends on states from the previous row `i-1`.\nIV. To implement this optimization using a single one-dimensional array, the inner loop that iterates through the possible sums `j` must be processed in increasing order (e.g., from `j = s_i` to `j = t`).\n\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n\nA. I only\n\nB. I and III only\n\nC. II and IV only\n\nD. I, III, and IV\n\nE. All of the above",
            "solution": "We define the dynamic programming table as follows: for integers $i \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,n\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,t\\}$, let $P[i][j]$ be a boolean indicating whether some subset of $\\{s_{1},\\ldots,s_{i}\\}$ sums to $j$. The recurrence relation is\n$$\nP[i][j] = P[i-1][j] \\lor \\bigl(j \\ge s_{i} \\land P[i-1][j - s_{i}]\\bigr),\n$$\nwith base cases $P[0][0] = \\text{true}$ and $P[0][j] = \\text{false}$ for all $j > 0$.\n\nStatement I: The table has $(n+1)(t+1)$ boolean entries. Hence the space used by the standard two-dimensional DP is $\\Theta(n t)$, i.e., $O(n \\cdot t)$. Therefore I is correct.\n\nStatement III: From the recurrence, every $P[i][j]$ depends only on $P[i-1][j]$ and $P[i-1][j - s_{i}]$, i.e., only on the previous row indexed by $i-1$. This locality in $i$ is exactly why space optimization is possible. Therefore III is correct.\n\nSpace optimization logic: Define a one-dimensional array $D[j]$ to represent the current row values for sums $j \\in \\{0,\\ldots,t\\}$. To simulate transition from row $i-1$ to row $i$ in-place, we must ensure that when computing the update\n$$\nD[j] \\leftarrow D[j] \\lor D[j - s_{i}],\n$$\nthe value $D[j - s_{i}]$ used comes from the previous row, not already updated in the current row. This is achieved by iterating $j$ in decreasing order from $t$ down to $s_{i}$. As a result, only $O(t)$ space is needed for $D$, plus constant extra space for indices and temporaries, so the optimized space is $O(t)$.\n\nStatement II: It claims the optimized space is $O(n + t)$ by using only the previous column, but the dependence is on the previous row, and the standard optimization uses a single array of length $t+1$, achieving $O(t)$ space, not $O(n + t)$. Therefore II is incorrect.\n\nStatement IV: It claims the inner loop must process $j$ in increasing order. As shown above, increasing order would permit reusing $s_{i}$ more than once because $D[j - s_{i}]$ could already include the contribution of $s_{i}$ from the current iteration. For example, after setting $D[s_{i}]$ to true, an increasing scan would allow $D[2 s_{i}] \\leftarrow D[2 s_{i}] \\lor D[s_{i}]$ to become true using $s_{i}$ twice, which is incorrect for the 0-1 subset problem. Thus we must iterate $j$ in decreasing order, and IV is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are I and III only.",
