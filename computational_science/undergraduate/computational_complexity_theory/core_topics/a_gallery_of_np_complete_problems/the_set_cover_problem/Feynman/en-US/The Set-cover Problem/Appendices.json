            "introduction": "The Set-cover problem is famous for being NP-complete, implying that finding a solution efficiently is generally intractable. However, understanding the boundaries of this complexity is key, as many special cases are surprisingly simple to solve. This first exercise  explores one such scenario where the cover is restricted to a single set, providing a gentle entry point and highlighting that practical constraints can sometimes make a hard problem easy.",

            "problem": "A software development startup is building a new application and has identified a universe of required features, denoted by the set $U$. To speed up development, they plan to use third-party modules. They have a collection of available modules, $S = \\{M_1, M_2, \\ldots, M_m\\}$, where each module $M_i$ provides a specific subset of the features in $U$.\n\nThe management wants to determine if it is possible to satisfy all feature requirements by purchasing at most one module, to keep integration simple. This is an instance of the Set-cover decision problem, where the goal is to find if there's a sub-collection of $S$ of size at most $k=1$ whose union covers all of $U$.\n\nAn intern, Alex, is tasked with writing a script to solve this. Alex proposes the following algorithm: \"Iterate through each module $M_i$ in the collection $S$. For each module, check if it contains every single feature listed in the universe $U$. If such a module is found, the answer is 'YES'. If all modules are checked and none satisfy this condition, the answer is 'NO'.\"\n\nConsider the following specific instance:\nThe universe of required features is $U = \\{\\text{user-auth, push-notify, in-app-purchase, analytics, cloud-sync, real-time-chat}\\}$.\nThe collection of available modules is $S = \\{M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4\\}$, where:\n- $M_1 = \\{\\text{user-auth, analytics, cloud-sync}\\}$\n- $M_2 = \\{\\text{user-auth, push-notify, in-app-purchase, analytics, cloud-sync, real-time-chat}\\}$\n- $M_3 = \\{\\text{push-notify, in-app-purchase, real-time-chat}\\}$\n- $M_4 = \\{\\text{user-auth, in-app-purchase, analytics, cloud-sync}\\}$\n\nEvaluate Alex's proposed algorithm and its outcome on this specific instance. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The algorithm is incorrect because the general Set-cover problem is NP-complete, meaning no polynomial-time algorithm can solve it. Therefore, Alex's algorithm is flawed and may not find a solution even if one exists.\n\nB. The algorithm is correct and runs in polynomial time. For the given instance, the answer is \"NO\", as no single module contains all the required features.\n\nC. The algorithm is correct and runs in polynomial time. For the given instance, the answer is \"YES\", as module $M_2$ covers all required features.\n\nD. The algorithm is correct, but it is not a polynomial-time algorithm. In the worst case, it has to check every feature for every module, which leads to an exponential-time complexity relative to the number of features.\n\nE. The algorithm is correct and runs in polynomial time. For the given instance, the answer is \"YES\", but a more efficient solution would be to combine modules $M_1$ and $M_3$.",
            "solution": "We formalize the instance as a Set-cover decision problem with parameter $k=1$. For $k=1$, the question “Is there a sub-collection of $S$ of size at most $1$ whose union covers $U$?” is equivalent to “Does there exist an index $i$ such that $U \\subseteq M_{i}$?”, since the union of a single set $\\{M_{i}\\}$ is exactly $M_{i}$. Therefore, the correctness condition for any algorithm solving this case is to check whether there exists $i$ with $U \\subseteq M_{i}$.\n\nAlex’s algorithm iterates over each $M_{i} \\in S$ and checks whether $U \\subseteq M_{i}$. If such an $M_{i}$ is found, it returns YES; otherwise, after exhausting all modules, it returns NO. This is exactly the necessary and sufficient condition for a YES instance when $k=1$, hence the algorithm is correct for this special case. The time complexity is polynomial: for each $M_{i}$, verifying $U \\subseteq M_{i}$ can be done by checking $u \\in M_{i}$ for every $u \\in U$, which is $O(|U|)$ with constant-time membership (e.g., hashing) or at worst $O(|U|+|M_{i}|)$ with standard representations. Over $m$ modules, this yields $O(m|U|)$ or similar, which is polynomial. It is not exponential.\n\nNow apply the algorithm to the given instance. Let\n$$\nU=\\{\\text{user-auth, push-notify, in-app-purchase, analytics, cloud-sync, real-time-chat}\\},\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_{1}&=\\{\\text{user-auth, analytics, cloud-sync}\\},\\\\\nM_{2}&=\\{\\text{user-auth, push-notify, in-app-purchase, analytics, cloud-sync, real-time-chat}\\},\\\\\nM_{3}&=\\{\\text{push-notify, in-app-purchase, real-time-chat}\\},\\\\\nM_{4}&=\\{\\text{user-auth, in-app-purchase, analytics, cloud-sync}\\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe check $U \\subseteq M_{i}$ for each $i$. For $M_{2}$, every element of $U$ is present in $M_{2}$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\forall u \\in U,\\quad u \\in M_{2},\n$$\nso $U \\subseteq M_{2}$ holds. Therefore, the algorithm returns YES on this instance.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: NP-completeness of general Set-cover does not preclude a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case $k=1$, and Alex’s algorithm is correct for this case.\n- B is incorrect: although the algorithm is correct and polynomial-time, the correct outcome here is YES because $M_{2}$ covers all features.\n- C is correct: the algorithm is correct, runs in polynomial time, and returns YES since $M_{2}$ covers $U$.\n- D is incorrect: the algorithm is polynomial-time, not exponential-time.\n- E is incorrect: while $M_{1} \\cup M_{3}=U$, claiming this is “more efficient” contradicts the $k=1$ objective; moreover, a single module $M_{2}$ already suffices.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.",
