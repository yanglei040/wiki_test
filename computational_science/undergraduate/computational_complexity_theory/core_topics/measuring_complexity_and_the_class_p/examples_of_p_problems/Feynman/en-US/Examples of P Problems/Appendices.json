This first exercise provides a direct, hands-on opportunity to do just that by counting the fundamental operations of a straightforward, brute-force algorithm. By formally quantifying the number of comparisons needed to find duplicate entries in a list, you will derive a polynomial expression that directly relates the input size, $N$, to the computational cost, illustrating a core principle of polynomial-time complexity.

            "problem": "A data integrity program is designed to test for the presence of duplicate entries within a dataset. The dataset is provided as a list containing $N$ elements. The program implements a brute-force comparison algorithm to determine if any duplicates exist.\n\nThe algorithm operates as follows:\n1. It selects the first element of the list and compares it with every subsequent element (i.e., the second, third, ..., up to the $N$-th element).\n2. It then selects the second element and compares it with every element that follows it (i.e., the third, fourth, ..., up to the $N$-th element).\n3. This process is repeated. For any given $i$-th element (where $i$ ranges from 1 to $N-1$), it is compared against all elements from the $(i+1)$-th position to the $N$-th position.\n4. The last operation is the comparison of the $(N-1)$-th element with the $N$-th element.\n\nWhat is the exact total number of comparisons the program will perform on a list of $N$ elements? Express your answer as a function of $N$.",

For each index $i$ with $1 \\leq i \\leq N-1$, the $i$-th element is compared with each element from positions $i+1$ through $N$, yielding $N - i$ comparisons at step $i$. Therefore,\n$$\nC(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (N - i).\n$$\nThis sum can be simplified by separating terms:\n$$\nC(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} N - \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i = N(N-1) - \\frac{(N-1)N}{2}.\n$$\nCombining like terms gives\n$$\nC(N) = \\frac{N(N-1)}{2}.\n$$\nEquivalently, this is the number of unordered pairs of distinct indices from $\\{1,2,\\ldots,N\\}$, which is $\\binom{N}{2}$, and evaluates to the same expression $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$.",

This practice explores a conceptual problem related to Boolean satisfiability, a topic that contains some of the hardest problems in computer science.

While solving #SAT for arbitrary formulas is a difficult task, the analysis of specific, structured families of formulas is a foundational exercise.\n\nConsider a family of Boolean formulas, denoted `F_N`, which is parameterized by an integer `N` where `N \\geq 2`. Each formula `F_N` is defined over a set of `N` Boolean variables, `{x_1, x_2, ..., x_N}`.\n\nAn assignment of truth values to these variables is defined as a satisfying assignment for `F_N` if and only if **exactly two** of the `N` variables are assigned the value `True`. All other `N-2` variables must be assigned `False`.\n\nYour task is to calculate the total number of satisfying assignments for the formula `F_N`. Express your answer as a function of `N`.",

Any such satisfying assignment is uniquely determined by the choice of which two variables among the $N$ are set to $True$; the rest are then forced to be $False$.\n\nSince the order of choosing the two variables does not matter, the number of such choices is the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{2}$. Using the factorial definition of binomial coefficients,\n$$\n\\binom{N}{2}=\\frac{N!}{2!\\,(N-2)!}.\n$$\nSimplifying with $N!/(N-2)! = N(N-1)$ and $2!=2$, we obtain\n$$\n\\binom{N}{2}=\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}.\n$$\nTherefore, the total number of satisfying assignments is $\\binom{N}{2}$ for $N\\geq 2$.",

This exercise challenges you to analyze the game of Nim, a classic problem in combinatorial game theory, to find a winning strategy.

            "problem": "In a strategic simulation, two autonomous agents are programmed to play the impartial game of Nim. The game consists of several piles of stones. On each turn, a player must choose one pile and remove at least one stone from it. The number of stones removed can be any amount from one up to the entire pile. The agent who takes the very last stone from the last remaining pile wins the game. This is known as normal play convention.\n\nA \"losing position\" in Nim is a state from which every possible move leads to a \"winning position\" for the other player. Conversely, a \"winning position\" is one from which there is at least one move that leads to a \"losing position\". An agent with an optimal strategy will always move to a losing position if possible.\n\nConsider a game state with four piles of stones. The sizes of the piles are 25, 20, 12, and 5. It is currently one agent's turn to move. To ensure a win, this agent must make a move that leaves the other agent in a losing position. How many distinct moves are available to the current agent to achieve this?\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1\n\nC. 2\n\nD. 3\n\nE. 4",

A move is winning if it results in a position with nim-sum zero.\n\nLet the piles be of sizes $a_{1}=25$, $a_{2}=20$, $a_{3}=12$, $a_{4}=5$.
