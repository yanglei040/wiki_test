            "introduction": "Many complex computational problems can be reframed as two-player games. This first exercise provides a concrete example using a game based on the graph theory concept of an independent set. The challenge is to find a winning strategy by thinking several moves ahead, illustrating the core idea of a \"forced win\" where one player can make a move that guarantees victory regardless of the opponent's response . This practice will help you develop the crucial skill of analyzing a game state to identify and execute optimal strategic plays.",

            "problem": "In a new competitive game called the Independent Set Game, two players, Player A and Player B, take turns claiming vertices from a given graph $G=(V, E)$. Once a vertex is claimed by a player, it cannot be chosen again by either player. A player wins as soon as their personal collection of claimed vertices contains an independent set of size $k$. An independent set is a set of vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge. If all vertices are claimed and no player has achieved the goal, the game is a draw.\n\nConsider an instance of this game played on a 7-cycle graph $G$, where the vertex set is $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ and the edge set is $E = \\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{3,4\\}, \\{4,5\\}, \\{5,6\\}, \\{6,7\\}, \\{7,1\\}\\}$. The target size for the independent set is $k=3$.\n\nThe game is already in progress. Player A has claimed vertex $\\{1\\}$, and Player B has claimed vertex $\\{4\\}$. It is now Player A's turn to choose an unclaimed vertex.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true?\n\nA. Player A has a winning strategy by choosing vertex 2 on this turn.\n\nB. Player A has a winning strategy by choosing vertex 3 on this turn.\n\nC. Player A has a winning strategy by choosing vertex 5 on this turn.\n\nD. Player A has a winning strategy by choosing vertex 7 on this turn.\n\nE. Player B has a winning strategy, meaning Player A has no move that can guarantee a win.",
            "solution": "We work on the 7-cycle $C_{7}$ with $V=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$ and edges $\\{\\{i,i+1\\}:i=1,\\ldots,6\\}\\cup\\{\\{7,1\\}\\}$. An independent set of size $3$ on $C_{7}$ must be a maximum independent set, and all such sets are exactly the $7$ triples\n$$\nS_{j}=\\{j,\\ j+2,\\ j+4\\}\\quad\\text{(indices taken modulo $7$ in $\\{1,\\ldots,7\\}$)}.\n$$\nThey are pairwise nonadjacent by construction (differences are $2$ or $4$ modulo $7$), and every maximum independent set has this form.\n\nInitially, Player A has $\\{1\\}$ and Player B has $\\{4\\}$. It is A’s turn.\n\nConsider A choosing $3$ on this turn. Then A has $\\{1,3\\}$. Observe that $\\{1,3\\}\\subset S_{1}=\\{1,3,5\\}$ and $\\{1,3\\}\\subset S_{6}=\\{6,1,3\\}$. Hence A threatens to complete either $S_{1}$ by taking $5$ or $S_{6}$ by taking $6$. On B’s reply:\n- If B takes $5$, then A takes $6$ next and wins with $\\{1,3,6\\}$.\n- If B takes $6$, then A takes $5$ next and wins with $\\{1,3,5\\}$.\n- If B takes any other vertex, both $5$ and $6$ remain available, so A takes either $5$ or $6$ next and wins.\nB cannot win before A’s next move because B currently has only one vertex ($4$) and needs two more to reach an independent triple, whereas A will complete on the immediate next move. Therefore, choosing $3$ gives A a forced win.\n\nFor completeness, we verify that the other listed first moves do not guarantee a win for A under optimal B play:\n- If A chooses $2$, B can reply with $3$. Then A cannot use $1$ anymore to reach $3$ (both $S_{1}$ and $S_{6}$ require $3$), and the only remaining triple available through $2$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$. B can always block this by taking whichever of $\\{5,7\\}$ A has not yet taken, so A has no forced win.\n- If A chooses $5$, then the immediate single threat is $S_{1}=\\{1,3,5\\}$; B blocks by taking $3$. After that, A’s only remaining triple through $5$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$, which B can always keep blocking as above; thus no forced win for A.\n- If A chooses $7$, B again replies with $3$, which eliminates both $S_{1}$ and $S_{6}$ (the only triples containing $1$ that A could aim for without $4$). The only remaining triple through $7$ is $S_{5}=\\{2,5,7\\}$, which B can block as before; hence no forced win for A.\n\nThus exactly choosing vertex $3$ gives Player A a winning strategy; the other listed moves do not guarantee a win, and Player B does not have a winning strategy overall in this position.",

            "introduction": "While many games require exploring a complex tree of possible moves, some can be solved by analyzing the game's fundamental rules and structure. This next problem, framed as a technological race, demonstrates how a simple counting argument can reveal the winner without a detailed turn-by-turn analysis. The solution hinges not on clever tactics within the game, but on an understanding of the game's total length and whose turn it will be when the winning move becomes possible . This exercise teaches the valuable lesson of looking for global invariants and \"shortcut\" solutions before getting lost in the details of a state space.",

            "problem": "In the competitive research and development game \"Tech Race,\" two strategists, Alice and Bob, take turns claiming ownership of key technologies. The game is played on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where vertices represent technologies and directed edges represent dependencies.\n\nThe available technologies and their dependencies are as follows:\n- **Fusion Reactor (T):** requires Sustained Burn (E) and Tritium Breeding (F).\n- **Sustained Burn (E):** requires Plasma Confinement (C) and Superconducting Magnets (D).\n- **Tritium Breeding (F):** requires Superconducting Magnets (D).\n- **Plasma Confinement (C):** requires Toroidal Coils (A) and Poloidal Coils (B).\n- **Toroidal Coils (A), Poloidal Coils (B), and Superconducting Magnets (D)** are foundational technologies with no prerequisites.\n\nThe rules of the game are:\n1. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice making the first move.\n2. On any given turn, a player claims one unclaimed technology.\n3. A technology can only be claimed if all of its immediate prerequisites have already been claimed. The prerequisite technologies can be claimed by either player.\n4. The first player to claim the Fusion Reactor (T) wins the game.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true?\n\nA. Alice has a winning strategy.\n\nB. Bob has a winning strategy.\n\nC. The winner depends on whether Alice's first move is to claim A, B, or D.\n\nD. Neither player has a winning strategy as the game can continue indefinitely.",
            "solution": "We formalize the dependency structure as a directed acyclic graph with technologies $A$, $B$, $D$ foundational; $C$ requiring $A$ and $B$; $E$ requiring $C$ and $D$; $F$ requiring $D$; and $T$ requiring $E$ and $F$.\n\nBy the rules, exactly one technology can be claimed per turn, and a technology is claimable only after all its immediate prerequisites have been claimed (by either player). The game ends immediately when $T$ is claimed.\n\nWe first identify the necessary technologies that must be claimed before $T$ becomes available:\n- Since $T$ requires $E$ and $F$, both $E$ and $F$ must be claimed before $T$ can be claimed.\n- $F$ requires $D$, so $D$ must be claimed before $F$.\n- $E$ requires $C$ and $D$, so $C$ and $D$ must be claimed before $E$.\n- $C$ requires $A$ and $B$, so $A$ and $B$ must be claimed before $C$.\n\nThus, the set $\\{A,B,C,D,E,F\\}$ must all be claimed before $T$ is available. These are six distinct technologies, and only one may be claimed per move. Therefore, at least $6$ moves are required before $T$ can possibly be claimed. Moreover, there are no other technologies to claim besides these six before $T$ becomes available, so the game necessarily proceeds by claiming exactly these six in some order during the first $6$ moves.\n\nConsequently:\n- $T$ cannot be claimed before move $7$.\n- After $6$ moves, all of $A,B,C,D,E,F$ have been claimed, so both prerequisites $E$ and $F$ of $T$ are satisfied, making $T$ available on the next move.\n- On move $7$, the player to move can claim $T$ and immediately wins.\n\nSince Alice moves on moves 1, 3, 5, and 7, she will be the player to move on the 7th move, at which point $T$ is first available. Hence Alice claims $T$ on move $7$ and wins, regardless of the order in which the prerequisites were claimed.\n\nTherefore, Alice has a winning strategy, and options B, C, and D are false: Bob cannot force a win; the winner does not depend on Alice’s first move; and the game cannot continue indefinitely because it must end by move $7$.",

            "solution": "To determine who has a winning strategy, we can analyze the game by exploring the tree of possible moves. Since both players play optimally, we can determine for each game state whether the current player to move is in a winning or losing position. A position is a winning position (W) if the current player can make a move that leads to a losing position (L) for the opponent. A position is a losing position (L) if all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent. A player who has no valid moves is in a losing position.\n\nLet's trace the game from the beginning. We will denote the player whose turn it is as P1 (Debater 1) or P2 (Debater 2). The state of the game can be represented by the set of propositions already asserted.\n\n**Move 1 (P1):**\nThe initial state is the empty set of asserted propositions, $\\emptyset$. The only proposition with no prerequisites is $A$. Therefore, Debater 1 has only one possible move: assert $A$.\n*   P1 asserts $A$.\n*   New state: $\\{A\\}$. It is now Debater 2's turn.\n\n**Move 2 (P2):**\nThe set of asserted propositions is $\\{A\\}$. P2 can assert any proposition whose prerequisites are in $\\{A\\}$. These are propositions $B$ and $C$. P2 has two choices. We must analyze both branches.\n\n*   **Case 1: P2 asserts $B$.**\n    *   New state: $\\{A, B\\}$. It is now P1's turn.\n    *   **Move 3 (P1):** P1 can assert any proposition whose prerequisites are in $\\{A, B\\}$. The valid moves are $C$ (requires $A$) and $D$ (requires $B$).\n        *   **Subcase 1.1: P1 asserts $C$.**\n            *   New state: $\\{A, B, C\\}$. It is now P2's turn.\n            *   **Move 4 (P2):** Valid moves for P2 are $D$ (requires $B$) and $E$ (requires $C$).\n                *   Let's analyze the rest of the game from $\\{A, B, C\\}$. There are 4 propositions left: $D, E, F, G$. Total moves will be $3+4=7$. The player making the last move wins. P1 made the 3rd move. P2 makes the 4th, P1 the 5th, P2 the 6th, P1 the 7th. After P1 makes move 7, all propositions are asserted, and it will be P2's turn with no moves left. P2 loses, P1 wins. Let's verify this sequence is forced.\n                *   From $\\{A, B, C\\}$, P2 can play $D$ or $E$.\n                    *   If P2 plays $D$ (Move 4): state $\\{A, B, C, D\\}$. P1's turn. Only valid move is $E$.\n                    *   P1 plays $E$ (Move 5): state $\\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$. P2's turn. Only valid move is $F$.\n                    *   P2 plays $F$ (Move 6): state $\\{A, B, C, D, E, F\\}$. P1's turn. Only valid move is $G$.\n                    *   P1 plays $G$ (Move 7): state $\\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G\\}$. All asserted. It's P2's turn, no moves left. P2 loses. P1 wins.\n                *   The same outcome occurs if P2 chose $E$ first, roles of D and E would be swapped between players. If P2 plays $E$ (Move 4), P1 must play $D$ (Move 5), P2 must play $F$ (Move 6), P1 must play $G$ (Move 7), P2 loses.\n                *   So, if P1 gets to the state $\\{A, B, C\\}$, P1 has a winning strategy. This means the state $\\{A, B, C\\}$ is an L-position for the current player (P2).\n            *   Therefore, in Subcase 1.1, P1's move to assert $C$ (from state $\\{A, B\\}$) is a move to an L-position for P2. This makes the state $\\{A, B\\}$ a W-position for P1.\n        *   Since P1 has found a winning move ($C$) from state $\\{A, B\\}$, we don't need to analyze P1's other option ($D$). An optimal P1 will choose $C$.\n\n*   **Case 2: P2 asserts $C$.**\n    *   New state: $\\{A, C\\}$. It is now P1's turn.\n    *   **Move 3 (P1):** P1 can assert any proposition whose prerequisites are in $\\{A, C\\}$. The valid moves are $B$ (requires $A$) and $E$ (requires $C$).\n        *   **Subcase 2.1: P1 asserts $B$.**\n            *   New state: $\\{A, C, B\\}$. This is the same state as $\\{A, B, C\\}$ from Subcase 1.1.\n            *   As we found, this state is an L-position for the current player (P2).\n            *   Therefore, P1's move to assert $B$ (from state $\\{A, C\\}$) is a move to an L-position for P2. This makes the state $\\{A, C\\}$ a W-position for P1.\n        *   Since P1 has found a winning move ($B$), we don't need to analyze P1's other option ($E$).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter P1's forced first move ($A$), the game is at state $\\{A\\}$ with P2 to move. P2 can choose to assert $B$ or $C$.\n- If P2 chooses $B$, the state becomes $\\{A, B\\}$. We found this is a W-position for P1. So P1 will win.\n- If P2 chooses $C$, the state becomes $\\{A, C\\}$. We found this is a W-position for P1. So P1 will win.\n\nIn either case, regardless of P2's first move, P1 can make a counter-move that ensures a win. Therefore, Debater 1 has a winning strategy from the start of the game.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Debater 1 has a winning strategy. This is true based on our analysis.\nB. Debater 2 has a winning strategy. This is false.\nC. The game can end in a draw if both players play optimally. This is false. The game involves a finite number of moves (7 propositions), and ends when a player cannot move. One player must lose.\nD. The outcome of the game depends on which proposition ($B$ or $C$) Debater 2 chooses to assert in their first move. This is false. We showed that Debater 1 wins regardless of Debater 2's choice.",
