            "problem": "In the study of computational complexity, the `PATH` problem for a directed graph determines if a path exists from a starting vertex $s$ to a target vertex $t$. The concept of strong connectivity is closely related. Two vertices $u$ and $v$ in a directed graph are said to be in the same strongly connected component if there is a path from $u$ to $v$ and also a path from $v$ to $u$.\n\nConsider a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ modeling a network. The set of vertices is $V = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks to identify pairs of vertices $(s, t)$ such that there is a path from $s$ to $t$ and also a path from $t$ to $s$. This is the definition of two vertices belonging to the same strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph. Therefore, our task is to find the SCCs of the given graph $G$ and then check which of the pairs in the options have both vertices in the same SCC.\n\nThe graph is defined by the vertex set $V = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\\}$ and the edge set $E = \\{(A,B), (B,C), (C,A), (C,D), (D,E), (E,D), (D,F), (F,G), (G,H), (H,F)\\}$.\n\nLet's identify the SCCs by looking for cycles and mutual reachability.\n\nFirst, consider the vertices $\\{A, B, C\\}$. The edges are $(A,B)$, $(B,C)$, and $(C,A)$. These form a cycle $A \\to B \\to C \\to A$. This means for any two vertices in this set, there is a path in both directions. For example, there's a path from $A$ to $B$ (the edge $(A,B)$) and a path from $B$ to $A$ (the path $B \\to C \\to A$). Thus, $\\{A, B, C\\}$ is a strongly connected component.\n\nNext, consider the vertices $\\{D, E\\}$. The edges are $(D,E)$ and $(E,D)$. These form a cycle $D \\to E \\to D$. There is a path from $D$ to $E$ and a path from $E$ to $D$. Thus, $\\{D, E\\}$ is a strongly connected component.\n\nNow, consider the vertices $\\{F, G, H\\}$. The edges are $(F,G)$, $(G,H)$, and $(H,F)$. These form a cycle $F \\to G \\to H \\to F$. For any two vertices in this set, there is a path in both directions. For instance, there's a path from $G$ to $F$ (the path $G \\to H \\to F$) and a path from $F$ to $G$ (the edge $(F,G)$). Thus, $\\{F, G, H\\}$ is a strongly connected component.\n\nWe have now partitioned all vertices into three sets: $S_1 = \\{A, B, C\\}$, $S_2 = \\{D, E\\}$, and $S_3 = \\{F, G, H\\}$, each being an SCC. The remaining edges, $(C,D)$ and $(D,F)$, are edges that connect these components. Specifically, $(C,D)$ connects $S_1$ to $S_2$, and $(D,F)$ connects $S_2$ to $S_3$. There are no paths leading from $S_2$ to $S_1$, or from $S_3$ to $S_2$ or $S_1$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options:\n\nA. (A, D): Vertex $A$ is in $S_1$ and vertex $D$ is in $S_2$. Since they are in different SCCs, there cannot be paths in both directions between them. We can verify this: a path from $A$ to $D$ exists ($A \\to B \\to C \\to D$). However, there is no path from $D$ back to $A$, as all paths leaving $S_2$ lead to $S_3$, never back to $S_1$. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. (B, C): Both vertex $B$ and vertex $C$ are in $S_1$. Since they are in the same SCC, there must be paths in both directions. Path from $B$ to $C$ is the edge $(B,C)$. Path from $C$ to $B$ is $C \\to A \\to B$. So, this option is correct.\n\nC. (E, F): Vertex $E$ is in $S_2$ and vertex $F$ is in $S_3$. They are in different SCCs. A path from $E$ to $F$ exists ($E \\to D \\to F$). However, there is no path from $F$ back to $E$, as all paths leaving $S_3$ stay within $S_3$. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. (F, A): Vertex $F$ is in $S_3$ and vertex $A$ is in $S_1$. They are in different SCCs. There is no path from $F$ to $A$. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nE. (H, G): Both vertex $H$ and vertex $G$ are in $S_3$. Since they are in the same SCC, there must be paths in both directions. Path from $H$ to $G$ is $H \\to F \\to G$. Path from $G$ to $H$ is the edge $(G,H)$. So, this option is correct.\n\nThe pairs that satisfy the condition are (B, C) and (H, G). Therefore, options B and E are the correct choices.",

            "problem": "The directed st-connectivity problem, often denoted as `PATH`, is a fundamental problem in computational complexity. It asks whether a path exists from a specified start vertex $s$ to a target vertex $t$ in a given directed graph $G=(V, E)$. The general version of this problem is known to be complete for the complexity class NL, Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space.\n\nLet us define the relevant complexity classes more formally:\n- **L (Logarithmic Space)**: The class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a read-only input tape and a read-write work tape of size $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input.\n- **NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space)**: The class of decision problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine under the same space constraints.\n\nNow, consider a restricted version of the problem, which we will call `U-PATH`. In `U-PATH`, the input consists of a directed graph $G=(V, E)$, a start vertex $s$, and a target vertex $t$. However, the graph $G$ comes with a specific structural promise: every vertex in $V$ has an out-degree of at most one.\n\nBased on an analysis of the computational resources required to solve `U-PATH`, which of the following statements most accurately characterizes its complexity?\n\nA. U-PATH is in L.\nB. U-PATH is NL-complete.\nC. U-PATH is P-complete (under log-space reductions).\nD. U-PATH is undecidable.\nE. U-PATH is in NL but is not known to be in L or to be NL-complete.",
            "solution": "Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph in which every vertex has out-degree at most one. Equivalently, there exists a partial function $f:V\\to V$ such that for each $u\\in V$, either there is no outgoing edge from $u$, or there is exactly one edge $(u,f(u))\\in E$. Given $s,t\\in V$, there is a directed path from $s$ to $t$ if and only if there exists $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{k}(s)=t$, where $f^{0}(s)=s$ and $f^{k+1}(s)=f(f^{k}(s))$ whenever $f^{k}$ is defined.\n\nWrite $n=|V|$. Starting from $s$, the sequence $s, f(s), f^{2}(s), \\dots$ either terminates at a vertex with no outgoing edge (a sink) or eventually repeats a vertex, forming a directed cycle. In either case, the number of distinct vertices visited is at most $n$. Therefore, if $t$ is reachable from $s$, there exists $k$ with $0\\leq k\\leq n-1$ such that $f^{k}(s)=t$.\n\nDeterministic logarithmic-space algorithm (membership in L):\n- Maintain two variables on the work tape:\n  - a current vertex $v$, initialized to $s$;\n  - a counter $c$, initialized to $0$, that will range from $0$ to $n$.\n  Both $v$ and $c$ can be stored using $O(\\log_{2} n)$ bits.\n- Repeat the following loop while $c\\leq n$:\n  1. If $v=t$, accept.\n  2. Find the unique outgoing neighbor of $v$, if it exists. This can be done by scanning the read-only input to locate an edge $(v,w)\\in E$. Because the input is read-only and vertices can be indexed, a single scan uses $O(\\log_{2} n)$ bits to hold indices and pointers.\n  3. If no outgoing neighbor exists, reject (since the unique forward walk has ended without reaching $t$).\n  4. Otherwise set $v:=w$ and increment $c:=c+1$.\n- If the loop finishes without accepting, reject.\n\nCorrectness:\n- If a path from $s$ to $t$ exists, then some $k\\leq n-1$ satisfies $f^{k}(s)=t$, so the algorithm accepts at iteration $k$.\n- If no such path exists, then along the unique forward walk from $s$, either a sink is encountered before reaching $t$ (immediate rejection), or a cycle disjoint from $t$ is entered. In the latter case, since there are at most $n$ distinct vertices on the walk, after $n$ increments the algorithm necessarily has not seen $t$ and rejects.\n\nSpace bound:\n- The algorithm stores $v$ and $c$, each using $O(\\log_{2} n)$ bits, and uses $O(\\log_{2} n)$ additional bits to scan the input for an outgoing edge of the current vertex. Thus the total workspace is $O(\\log_{2} n)$, i.e., deterministic logarithmic space.\n\nHence `U-PATH` is solvable in deterministic logarithmic space, so `U-PATH` is in L. Therefore, among the options, the most accurate characterization is option A.\n\nSince `U-PATH` is in L, it cannot be NL-complete unless $\\mathrm{L}=\\mathrm{NL}$, and it is not P-complete unless $\\mathrm{L}=\\mathrm{P}$. The problem is certainly decidable, so D is false, and E is false because we have an explicit L algorithm.",
