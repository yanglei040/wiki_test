            "problem": "In computational complexity theory, a Boolean formula is said to be in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) if it is a conjunction (AND, denoted by $\\land$) of one or more clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR, denoted by $\\lor$) of literals. A literal is either a Boolean variable (e.g., $x_i$) or its negation (e.g., $\\neg x_i$).\n\nA special case of this is a **1-CNF formula**, where every clause consists of exactly one literal. For example, $\\phi = (x_1) \\land (\\neg x_2) \\land (x_3)$ is a 1-CNF formula.\n\nA formula is called **satisfiable** if there exists at least one truth assignment (an assignment of TRUE or FALSE to each variable) that makes the entire formula evaluate to TRUE. If no such assignment exists, the formula is unsatisfiable.\n\nA student is tasked with creating a very efficient algorithm to determine if a given 1-CNF formula is satisfiable. They realize that due to the simple structure of 1-CNF, there must be a straightforward condition that is both necessary and sufficient for satisfiability.\n\nWhich of the following conditions is both necessary and sufficient for any given 1-CNF formula to be satisfiable?\n\nA. The formula contains at most one clause.\n\nB. For every variable $x$, the formula does not simultaneously contain a clause $(x)$ and a clause $(\\neg x)$.\n\nC. The number of clauses is strictly less than the number of distinct variables appearing in the formula.\n\nD. Every variable appears in at most one clause.\n\nE. At least one variable in the formula appears only as a positive literal (e.g., $x_i$) or only as a negative literal (e.g., $\\neg x_j$).",
            "solution": "Let a 1-CNF formula be written as a conjunction of unit clauses:\n$$\n\\phi \\;=\\; \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} L_{i},\n$$\nwhere each $L_{i}$ is a literal, i.e., either $x$ or $\\neg x$ for some variable $x$. A truth assignment satisfies $\\phi$ if and only if every clause evaluates to TRUE.\n\nWe claim that the following condition is both necessary and sufficient for satisfiability:\nFor every variable $x$, $\\phi$ does not contain both $(x)$ and $(\\neg x)$ as clauses. This is precisely option B.\n\nNecessity: Suppose $\\phi$ contains both $(x)$ and $(\\neg x)$ for some variable $x$. If an assignment sets $x=\\text{TRUE}$, then $(\\neg x)$ is FALSE; if it sets $x=\\text{FALSE}$, then $(x)$ is FALSE. Hence no assignment can make both clauses TRUE simultaneously, so $\\phi$ is unsatisfiable. Therefore, the condition in B is necessary.\n\nSufficiency: Suppose that for every variable $x$, $\\phi$ does not contain both $(x)$ and $(\\neg x)$. Define an assignment $a$ by:\n- If $(x)$ appears in $\\phi$, set $a(x)=\\text{TRUE}$.\n- Else if $(\\neg x)$ appears in $\\phi$, set $a(x)=\\text{FALSE}$.\n- Else (if $x$ does not appear), set $a(x)$ arbitrarily.\nUnder $a$, any clause $(x)$ is TRUE and any clause $(\\neg x)$ is TRUE by construction. Hence all clauses in $\\phi$ are TRUE, so $\\phi$ is satisfiable. Therefore, the condition in B is sufficient.\n\nTo confirm that no other option is both necessary and sufficient:\n- A (at most one clause) is not necessary: for example, $(x_{1}) \\land (x_{2})$ is satisfiable with two clauses.\n- C (number of clauses strictly less than number of distinct variables) is not necessary: $(x)$ has one clause and one variable, so the inequality fails, yet it is satisfiable. Although C is sufficient (if $m<n$, then unsatisfiability would require at least one variable to appear with both polarities, which forces $m \\geq n+1$, a contradiction), it is not necessary.\n- D (every variable appears in at most one clause) is not necessary: $(x) \\land (x)$ is satisfiable but violates D. It is sufficient but not necessary.\n- E (at least one variable appears only with one polarity) is not sufficient: $(x) \\land (y) \\land (\\neg y)$ is unsatisfiable but satisfies E. It is also not characterizing in general.\n\nThus, only B is both necessary and sufficient.",
