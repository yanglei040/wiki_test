The set of all possible computation sequences for an NTM on a given input can be represented by a computation tree. The root of this tree is the initial configuration (which includes the machine's starting state, the input on the tape, and the initial head position). A node at depth $d$ in the tree represents a configuration reachable after $d$ computational steps. The children of a node are all the configurations that can be reached from it in a single step according to the machine's transition function.\n\nConsider a particular NTM whose transition function is such that for any configuration, there are at most two possible configurations it can transition to in the next step.

The transition function allows at most two possible next configurations from any configuration, so the branching factor is at most $2$.\n\nAt the root (depth $0$), there is exactly one configuration, so $N(0)=1$. From any configuration at depth $d$, there are at most $2$ children at depth $d+1$.

            "problem": "A specific Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM), which we will call $M$, is defined to operate on a one-way infinite tape. $M$ has the set of states $\\{q_{gen}, q_{rewind}, q_{check\\_first}, q_{check\\_rest}, q_{accept}, q_{reject}\\}$. The input alphabet is $\\{a\\}$ and the tape alphabet is $\\{a, 0, 1, \\sqcup\\}$, where $\\sqcup$ is the blank symbol. The machine starts in state $q_{gen}$ with its head on the leftmost symbol of the input string. The transitions are defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Generation:** If in state $q_{gen}$ and reading an 'a', $M$ nondeterministically chooses one of two moves: (i) write '0', move right, and stay in $q_{gen}$, or (ii) write '1', move right, and stay in $q_{gen}$.\n2.  **Start Verification:** Upon reading a blank symbol $\\sqcup$ in state $q_{gen}$, $M$ writes $\\sqcup$, moves its head one position to the left, and transitions to state $q_{rewind}$.\n3.  **Rewind:** In state $q_{rewind}$, $M$ repeatedly moves its head to the left as long as it reads a '0' or a '1'. When an internal mechanism detects that the head has moved to the left of the starting cell (cell 0), it automatically places the head back on the first cell (cell 1) and the machine transitions to state $q_{check\\_first}$.\n4.  **Check First Symbol:** In state $q_{check\\_first}$, if the head reads a '1', $M$ moves right and transitions to $q_{check\\_rest}$. If it reads a '0', it transitions immediately to the halting state $q_{reject}$.\n5.  **Check Remainder:** In state $q_{check\\_rest}$, if the head reads a '0', $M$ moves right and stays in $q_{check\\_rest}$. If it reads a '1', it transitions immediately to the halting state $q_{reject}$.\n6.  **Accept/Reject:** If $M$ is in state $q_{check\\_rest}$ and reads a blank symbol $\\sqcup$, it transitions to the halting state $q_{accept}$. The state $q_{reject}$ is also a halting state. Any configuration for which a transition is not explicitly defined above results in the machine transitioning to $q_{reject}$.\n\nThis NTM is run on an input string $w = a^n$, which consists of the symbol 'a' repeated $n$ times, where $n$ is a positive integer. The computation of the NTM on this input can be represented as a computation tree, where each path from the root to a leaf node (a halting configuration) represents one possible sequence of nondeterministic choices.\n\nDetermine a formula for the total number of distinct paths in the computation tree for the NTM $M$ on input $a^n$. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$.",
            "solution": "Interpret the computation tree as branching only where the machine makes nondeterministic choices. In state $q_{gen}$ on input $a^{n}$, the head scans each of the $n$ input symbols exactly once from left to right, and at each symbol it nondeterministically chooses between two actions: write $0$ or write $1$, then move right and remain in $q_{gen}$. By the rule of product, the total number of distinct sequences of nondeterministic choices during this generation phase is\n$$\n2 \\times 2 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 = 2^{n}.\n$$\nOnce the blank $\\sqcup$ to the right of the $n$th symbol is read, the machine deterministically executes the rewind and verification phases. The transitions in $q_{rewind}$, $q_{check\\_first}$, and $q_{check\\_rest}$ are deterministic given the generated length-$n$ binary string, and any undefined case goes directly to the halting state $q_{reject}$. Therefore, each distinct sequence of nondeterministic generation choices determines exactly one root-to-leaf path that halts (either in $q_{accept}$ or in $q_{reject}$). Hence the total number of distinct root-to-leaf computation paths equals the number of length-$n$ binary strings, which is $2^{n}$. Equivalently, by counting all possible placements of ones among $n$ positions,\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n}.\n$$\nThus, the total number of distinct computation paths is $2^{n}$.",
