Batching implementation: $T_2(n) = 5\\,n^{3/2} + 11$.\n\nThe crossover point $n_0$ is the positive solution to the equation $T_1(n) = T_2(n)$. We begin by setting up this equality:\n$$5\\,n \\ln n + 10\\bigl(1 - \\ln 2\\bigr)\\,n + 11 = 5\\,n^{3/2} + 11$$\n\nWe can simplify this equation by first subtracting $11$ from both sides:\n$$5\\,n \\ln n + 10\\bigl(1 - \\ln 2\\bigr)\\,n = 5\\,n^{3/2}$$\n\nSince $n$ represents the input size, it must be a positive quantity ($n > 0$).

I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nLet $C$ be the random variable representing the total number of primitive steps for a successful lookup. The total cost is the sum of the hashing cost, $C_{\\text{hash}}$, and the comparison cost, $C_{\\text{comp}}$.\n$$C = C_{\\text{hash}} + C_{\\text{comp}}$$\nThe cost to compute the hash of a key of length $L$ is given as $c_h L$. This cost is incurred for every lookup, regardless of which hash function (URH or adversarial) is active. Therefore, the expected hashing cost is constant:\n$$E[C_{\\text{hash}}] = c_h L$$\nThe total expected cost is:\n$$E[C] = E[C_{\\text{hash}}] + E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = c_h L + E[C_{\\text{comp}}]$$\nWe need to find the expected comparison cost, $E[C_{\\text{comp}}]$. We use the law of total expectation based on the mixture model for the hash function:\n$$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = P(\\text{URH}) \\cdot E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}] + P(\\text{adv}) \\cdot E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{adv}]$$\nGiven $P(\\text{URH}) = 1 - \\alpha$ and $P(\\text{adv}) = \\alpha$, this becomes:\n$$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = (1 - \\alpha) E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}] + \\alpha E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{adv}]$$\n\nWe will now calculate the expected comparison cost for each case separately.\n\n**1. Expected Comparison Cost under Uniform Random Hashing ($E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}]$)**\n\nFor a successful search, we are looking for one of the $n$ keys, chosen uniformly at random. Let $N_j$ be the number of keys that hash to bucket $j$. Since the keys in any chain are randomly permuted, the total number of comparisons required to find each of the $N_j$ keys in bucket $j$ exactly once is $c_c \\cdot (1 + 2 + \\dots + N_j) = c_c \\frac{N_j(N_j+1)}{2}$.\nThe total number of comparisons to find all $n$ keys in the table is the sum over all buckets: $\\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} c_c \\frac{N_j(N_j+1)}{2}$.\nSince the search query is for a uniformly random key, the expected number of comparisons is the expectation of this total cost divided by $n$:\n$$E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}] = E\\left[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} c_c \\frac{N_j(N_j+1)}{2} \\right]$$\nBy linearity of expectation:\n$$E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}] = \\frac{c_c}{2n} \\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} E[N_j^2 + N_j] = \\frac{c_c}{2n} \\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} (E[N_j^2] + E[N_j])$$\nUnder URH, the number of keys $N_j$ landing in bucket $j$ follows a binomial distribution $N_j \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p=\\frac{1}{M})$.\nThe expectation and variance are $E[N_j] = np = \\frac{n}{M}$ and $\\text{Var}(N_j) = np(1-p) = \\frac{n}{M}(1-\\frac{1}{M})$.\nFrom the relation $\\text{Var}(N_j) = E[N_j^2] - (E[N_j])^2$, we find $E[N_j^2]$:\n$$E[N_j^2] = \\text{Var}(N_j) + (E[N_j])^2 = \\frac{n}{M}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{M}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{n}{M}\\right)^2 = \\frac{n}{M} - \\frac{n}{M^2} + \\frac{n^2}{M^2}$$\nSubstituting these into the sum:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} (E[N_j^2] + E[N_j]) = \\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} \\left( \\left(\\frac{n}{M} - \\frac{n}{M^2} + \\frac{n^2}{M^2}\\right) + \\frac{n}{M} \\right) $$\nSince this term is identical for all $M$ buckets:\n$$ = M \\left( \\frac{2n}{M} - \\frac{n}{M^2} + \\frac{n^2}{M^2} \\right) = 2n - \\frac{n}{M} + \\frac{n^2}{M} = 2n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{M} $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}]$:\n$$E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}] = \\frac{c_c}{2n} \\left( 2n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{M} \\right) = c_c \\left( 1 + \\frac{n-1}{2M} \\right)$$\nUsing the problem's constraint $M=n$:\n$$E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}] = c_c \\left( 1 + \\frac{n-1}{2n} \\right) = c_c \\left( \\frac{2n + n - 1}{2n} \\right) = c_c \\left( \\frac{3n-1}{2n} \\right)$$\n\n**2. Expected Comparison Cost under Adversarial Hashing ($E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{adv}]$)**\n\nIn the adversarial case, all $n$ keys are hashed to the same bucket (bucket $0$). This creates a single linked list of length $n$. The search is for a uniformly random key among these $n$ keys. Since the keys are in a random permutation, the position of the desired key is uniformly distributed in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe expected number of comparisons is $c_c$ times the expected position:\n$$E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{adv}] = c_c \\cdot E[\\text{position}] = c_c \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n i\\right) = c_c \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right) = c_c \\frac{n+1}{2}$$\n\n**3. Combining the Results**\n\nNow we combine the two cases using the mixture parameter $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{n}$.\n$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right) E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{URH}] + \\frac{1}{n} E[C_{\\text{comp}} | \\text{adv}]$\n$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = \\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right) c_c \\left(\\frac{3n-1}{2n}\\right) + \\frac{1}{n} c_c \\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)$\n$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = c_c \\left[ \\frac{(n-1)(3n-1)}{2n^2} + \\frac{n+1}{2n} \\right]$\nTo combine these terms, we use a common denominator of $2n^2$:\n$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = c_c \\left[ \\frac{3n^2 - 3n - n + 1}{2n^2} + \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} \\right]$\n$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = c_c \\left[ \\frac{3n^2 - 4n + 1}{2n^2} + \\frac{n^2 + n}{2n^2} \\right]$\n$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = c_c \\left[ \\frac{(3n^2 - 4n + 1) + (n^2 + n)}{2n^2} \\right]$\n$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = c_c \\left[ \\frac{4n^2 - 3n + 1}{2n^2} \\right]$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing each term in the numerator by the denominator:\n$E[C_{\\text{comp}}] = c_c \\left( \\frac{4n^2}{2n^2} - \\frac{3n}{2n^2} + \\frac{1}{2n^2} \\right) = c_c \\left( 2 - \\frac{3}{2n} + \\frac{1}{2n^2} \\right)$\n\n**4.
