A feasible $s$-$t$ flow assigns to each arc $e \\in E$ a nonnegative value $f_e$ not exceeding its capacity $u_e$, satisfies flow conservation at every node $v \\in V \\setminus \\{s,t\\}$, and ships a prescribed total flow value $F$ from $s$ to $t$. The cost is separable across arcs: each arc $e$ has a cost function $c_e(f_e)$, and the total cost is $\\sum_{e \\in E} c_e(f_e)$. In the standard linear model, $c_e(f_e) = a_e f_e$ for some nonnegative $a_e$, and the node-arc incidence matrix of $G$ is totally unimodular, implying that with integer capacities and integer supplies/demands there exists an optimal flow in which all $f_e$ are integers.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-defined problem in the field of network optimization, specifically concerning minimum-cost flows.\n\n### Problem Formalization\nThe problem is set on a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ with a source node $s$ and a sink node $t$. The graph consists of two parallel arcs, $e_1$ and $e_2$, both directed from $s$ to $t$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the flow on arcs $e_1$ and $e_2$, respectively.\n\nThe problem is to find a flow $(x_1, x_2)$ that minimizes the total cost, subject to a set of constraints. The givens are:\n- **Total flow requirement:** The total flow from $s$ to $t$ must be $F=1$. This gives the conservation equation:\n$$x_1 + x_2 = 1$$\n- **Capacity constraints:** The flow on each arc cannot exceed its capacity.\n$$0 \\le x_1 \\le u_{e_1} = 1$$\n$$0 \\le x_2 \\le u_{e_2} = 1$$\n- **Cost function:** The total cost is the sum of the costs on each arc, $C(x_1, x_2) = c_{e_1}(x_1) + c_{e_2}(x_2)$. The specific forms of $c_{e_1}$ and $c_{e_2}$ are given in each option.\n\nThe task is to identify which option for the cost functions $c_{e_1}(\\cdot)$ and $c_{e_2}(\\cdot)$ guarantees that *every* optimal flow solution $(x_1^*, x_2^*)$ is fractional. An integer flow solution, given the constraints, must be either $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 0)$ or $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 1)$. A fractional solution is any other valid flow, i.e., where $0  x_1  1$ and $0  x_2  1$.\n\nWe can simplify the optimization problem by expressing $x_2$ in terms of $x_1$ using the total flow constraint: $x_2 = 1 - x_1$. The capacity constraints $0 \\le x_1 \\le 1$ and $0 \\le x_2 \\le 1$ are then equivalent to the single constraint $0 \\le x_1 \\le 1$.\nThe problem thus becomes:\n$$\\text{minimize } C(x_1) = c_{e_1}(x_1) + c_{e_2}(1-x_1)$$\n$$\\text{subject to } 0 \\le x_1 \\le 1$$\n\nWe now analyze each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Linear equal unit costs: $c_{e_1}(x_1) = x_1$ and $c_{e_2}(x_2) = x_2$.**\n\nThe total cost function is $C(x_1, x_2) = c_{e_1}(x_1) + c_{e_2}(x_2) = x_1 + x_2$.\nGiven the total flow constraint $x_1 + x_2 = 1$, the cost for any feasible flow is constant:\n$$C(x_1, x_2) = 1$$\nSince the cost is the same for all feasible flows, every feasible flow is an optimal flow. The set of optimal solutions is $\\{(x_1, 1-x_1) | x_1 \\in [0, 1]\\}$. This set includes the integer solutions $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$, as well as infinitely many fractional solutions like $(0.5, 0.5)$.\nBecause integer optimal solutions exist, this option does not guarantee that every optimal flow is fractional.\n\n**Verdict on A: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Strictly convex equal costs: $c_{e_1}(x_1) = x_1^2$ and $c_{e_2}(x_2) = x_2^2$.**\n\nThe total cost function, as a function of $x_1$, is:\n$$C(x_1) = x_1^2 + (1-x_1)^2 = x_1^2 + (1 - 2x_1 + x_1^2) = 2x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 1$$\nWe need to minimize this function over the interval $x_1 \\in [0, 1]$. The function $C(x_1)$ is a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient, representing a parabola opening upwards, so it is strictly convex. A strictly convex function on a closed interval has a unique global minimum.\nTo find the minimum, we compute the first derivative and set it to zero:\n$$C'(x_1) = \\frac{d}{dx_1}(2x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 1) = 4x_1 - 2$$\nSetting $C'(x_1) = 0$ gives $4x_1 - 2 = 0$, which solves to $x_1 = 1/2$.\nSince this value $x_1^* = 1/2$ is within the feasible interval $[0, 1]$, it is the unique minimizer.\nThe corresponding flow on the second arc is $x_2^* = 1 - x_1^* = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2$.\nThe unique optimal flow is $(x_1^*, x_2^*) = (1/2, 1/2)$. Both components are non-integer.\nBecause the optimal solution is unique and fractional, it is guaranteed that *every* optimal flow must be fractional.\n\n**Verdict on B: Correct.**\n\n**C. Linear unequal unit costs: $c_{e_1}(x_1) = 0 \\cdot x_1$ and $c_{e_2}(x_2) = 2 x_2$.**\n\nThe total cost function is $C(x_1, x_2) = 0 \\cdot x_1 + 2x_2 = 2x_2$.\nAs a function of $x_1$, this is:\n$$C(x_1) = 2(1-x_1) = 2 - 2x_1$$\nThis is a linear function of $x_1$ with a negative slope. To minimize this function on the interval $x_1 \\in [0, 1]$, we must choose the largest possible value for $x_1$.\nThe maximum value in the interval is $x_1^* = 1$.\nThe unique optimal solution is $x_1^* = 1$, which gives $x_2^* = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nThe optimal flow is $(1, 0)$. This is an integer solution.\n\n**Verdict on C: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Concave equal costs: $c_{e_1}(x_1) = \\sqrt{x_1}$ and $c_{e_2}(x_2) = \\sqrt{x_2}$.**\n\nThe total cost function, as a function of $x_1$, is:\n$$C(x_1) = \\sqrt{x_1} + \\sqrt{1-x_1}$$\nWe must minimize this function on the interval $x_1 \\in [0, 1]$. To determine the nature of this function, we examine its second derivative:\n$$C'(x_1) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x_1}} - \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{1-x_1}}$$\n$$C''(x_1) = -\\frac{1}{4}x_1^{-3/2} - \\frac{1}{4}(1-x_1)^{-3/2} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{x_1\\sqrt{x_1}} + \\frac{1}{(1-x_1)\\sqrt{1-x_1}}\\right)$$\nFor all $x_1 \\in (0, 1)$, $C''(x_1)  0$. This means the cost function $C(x_1)$ is strictly concave on the interior of its domain. A fundamental property of concave functions is that their minimum over a closed, convex set (like the interval $[0, 1]$) must occur at one of the extreme points (endpoints) of the set.\nThe endpoints of the interval are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_1 = 1$. We evaluate the cost at these points:\n- For $x_1=0$: $C(0) = \\sqrt{0} + \\sqrt{1-0} = 1$. This corresponds to the flow $(0, 1)$.\n- For $x_1=1$: $C(1) = \\sqrt{1} + \\sqrt{1-1} = 1$. This corresponds to the flow $(1, 0)$.\nThe minimum cost is $1$, and it is achieved for two flows: $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$.\nBoth of these optimal solutions are integer solutions.\n\n**Verdict on D: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly the case with strictly convex costs (Option B) results in a situation where the unique optimal flow is fractional, thereby guaranteeing that any optimal solution must be fractional. The convexity of the cost function penalizes concentrating flow on a single arc, favoring a split of flow between the parallel arcs, which, in this symmetric case, results in an equal split.",

Formally, let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph with $|V|=n$ vertices and $|E|=m$ edges. Each edge $(u,v)\\in E$ has a nonnegative capacity and a real-valued cost per unit flow. A subset $K\\subseteq V$ of vertices is capacity-constrained: each $v\\in K$ has a finite vertex capacity $U_v\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ that upper-bounds the total flow passing through $v$.

It is a well-posed problem in the domain of network flow algorithms, based on established principles of graph transformations. The provided definitions are self-contained and consistent.\n\nThe task is to determine the change in the total number of vertices and edges, $\\Delta S = (|V'|+|E'|) - (|V|+|E|)$, when a graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex capacities is transformed into an equivalent graph $G'=(V',E')$ with only edge capacities. The transformation is defined for a subset of $k=|K|$ vertices which have finite capacities.\n\nLet $n = |V|$ be the number of vertices and $m = |E|$ be the number of edges in the original graph $G$. Let $k = |K|$ be the number of vertices with finite capacities.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for $|V'|$, the number of vertices in the transformed graph $G'$.\nThe set of vertices $V$ is partitioned into two disjoint subsets: the set $K$ of capacitated vertices, with $|K|=k$, and the set $V \\setminus K$ of non-capacitated vertices, with $|V \\setminus K| = n-k$.\nThe transformation rule states:\n- Each of the $k$ vertices in $K$ is replaced by two new vertices, $v^{\\text{in}}$ and $v^{\\text{out}}$. This contributes $2k$ vertices to $V'$.\n- The $n-k$ vertices in $V \\setminus K$ are left unchanged. These vertices are also part of $V'$.\nThe new set of vertices $V'$ is the union of the set of all $v^{\\text{in}}$ and $v^{\\text{out}}$ for $v\\in K$, and the set $V\\setminus K$. These sets are disjoint.\nTherefore, the total number of vertices in $G'$ is:\n$$|V'| = 2k + (n-k) = n+k$$\n\nNext, we derive an expression for $|E'|$, the number of edges in the transformed graph $G'$.\nThe set of edges $E'$ is composed of two distinct types of edges:\n1.  **New internal edges**: For each of the $k$ vertices $v \\in K$ that are split, a new \"internal\" edge $(v^{\\text{in}}, v^{\\text{out}})$ is added to the graph. Since there are $k$ such vertices, this adds exactly $k$ new edges.\n2.  **Redirected original edges**: The transformation specifies rules for redirecting every original edge in $E$. Let's analyze an arbitrary edge $(u,v) \\in E$:\n    - If $u \\notin K$ and $v \\notin K$, the edge remains $(u,v)$.\n    - If $u \\notin K$ and $v \\in K$, the edge is redirected to $(u, v^{\\text{in}})$.\n    - If $u \\in K$ and $v \\notin K$, the edge is redirected to $(u^{\\text{out}}, v)$.\n    - If $u \\in K$ and $v \\in K$, the edge is redirected to $(u^{\\text{out}}, v^{\\text{in}})$.\nIn all cases, each of the $m$ original edges in $E$ is mapped to exactly one edge in $E'$. The complex redirection rules simply define the new endpoints but do not alter the number of these edges. Thus, there are $m$ such edges in $E'$.\n\nCombining these two components, the total number of edges in $G'$ is the sum of the new internal edges and the redirected original edges:\n$$|E'| = k + m$$\n\nNow, we can compute the change in graph size, $\\Delta S$, defined as $S(G') - S(G)$, where the size $S(G)$ of a graph $G$ is given by $|V|+|E|$.\nThe size of the original graph is $S(G) = |V| + |E| = n+m$.\nThe size of the transformed graph is $S(G') = |V'| + |E'| = (n+k) + (m+k) = n+m+2k$.\n\nThe absolute change in graph size is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta S = S(G') - S(G) = \\bigl(|V'|+|E'|\\bigr) - \\bigl(|V|+|E|\\bigr)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta S = (n+m+2k) - (n+m) = 2k\n$$\nInterestingly, the change in size depends only on the number of capacitated vertices, $k$, and not on the total number of vertices or edges.\n\nFinally, we are asked to evaluate $\\Delta S$ for a specific instance with $n=18$, $m=44$, and $k=13$.\nSubstituting $k=13$ into our derived expression for $\\Delta S$:\n$$\n\\Delta S = 2k = 2 \\times 13 = 26\n$$\n\nThe total size of the graph, measured as the sum of the number of vertices and edges, increases by $26$.",

It uses standard definitions of residual networks, optimality conditions (absence of negative-cost cycles), and cycle augmentation. The language is objective and precise.\n\n2.  **Self-Containment and Consistency**:\n    - The problem statement specifies the complete node set $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ and asserts that there are \"no other residual edges\". This implies that the network is closed and any feasible flow is a circulation, as there are no specified source or sink nodes with external demands.\n    - The problem is a minimum-cost circulation problem.\n    - The costs of all given residual edges are positive. The problem states that costs on residual forward edges equal original edge costs. This implies that the original graph edges corresponding to these residual edges—$(A,B), (B,C), (C,A), (B,D), (D,A)$—all have positive costs.\n    - In a minimum-cost circulation problem where all edge costs are non-negative, any non-zero circulation must have a total cost greater than or equal to zero. The zero flow, $f_0(e)=0$ for all edges $e$, is a valid circulation with a total cost of $0$. Therefore, the unique optimal solution for the initial problem is the zero flow, $f_0 = 0$.\n    - This deduction uniquely determines the initial optimal state. The initial flow on every edge is $0$, and the initial total cost is $C_{\\text{old}} = 0$.\n    - This makes the problem well-posed, as the ambiguity about the initial flow is resolved. The phrase \"maximum possible decrease\" is likely superfluous, as there is only one possible initial optimal state.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The problem is valid. It requires a careful deduction that the initial optimal flow must be the zero flow.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nLet $c(u,v)$ be the cost of an edge $(u,v)$ in the original network. The initial state is an optimal flow $f_0$ with total cost $C_{\\text{old}}$. As established during validation, the problem is a minimum-cost circulation problem with non-negative edge costs. The only optimal flow is the zero flow, $f_0(e) = 0$ for all edges $e$. Therefore, the initial flow on edge $(A,B)$ is $f_0(A,B) = 0$, and the initial total cost is $C_{\\text{old}} = 0$.\n\nThe residual capacity of a forward edge $(u,v)$ is given by $u_{f_0}(u,v) = \\text{capacity}(u,v) - f_0(u,v)$. Since $f_0=0$, the given residual capacities are the capacities of the original edges. For instance, $\\text{capacity}(A,B) = 3$.\n\nThe cost of the edge $(A,B)$ is reduced by $\\Delta = 9$. The initial cost of the residual edge $(A,B)$ is given as $4$, so the original edge cost was $c(A,B) = 4$. The new cost is $c'(A,B) = c(A,B) - \\Delta = 4 - 9 = -5$.\n\nThis cost change affects the costs in the residual network. The residual network for the flow $f_0=0$ is the original network itself. The cost of the residual edge $(A,B)$ changes from $4$ to $-5$. All other residual edge costs remain the same.\n\nThe new residual network is no longer optimal because the cost change may have introduced negative-cost cycles. Let's check the cycles involving edge $(A,B)$:\n1.  Cycle $\\gamma_1 = A \\to B \\to C \\to A$. The new cost of this cycle is:\n    $$C'(\\gamma_1) = c'(A,B) + c(B,C) + c(C,A) = -5 + 1 + 2 = -2$$\n    This is a negative-cost cycle.\n\n2.  Cycle $\\gamma_2 = A \\to B \\to D \\to A$. The new cost of this cycle is:\n    $$C'(\\gamma_2) = c'(A,B) + c(B,D) + c(D,A) = -5 + 1 + 5 = 1$$\n    This cycle does not have a negative cost.\n\nTo restore optimality, we must augment flow along all negative-cost cycles until none remain. The only negative-cost cycle is $\\gamma_1$.\n\nThe amount of flow $k$ we can push along $\\gamma_1$ is limited by the bottleneck residual capacity of its edges:\n$$k = \\min(u_{f_0}(A,B), u_{f_0}(B,C), u_{f_0}(C,A)) = \\min(3, 2, 1) = 1$$\nWe augment the flow by sending $k=1$ unit of flow along the cycle $A \\to B \\to C \\to A$.\n\nThe new flow, $f_1$, is obtained by adding this circulation to the initial zero flow:\n- $f_1(A,B) = f_0(A,B) + k = 0 + 1 = 1$\n- $f_1(B,C) = f_0(B,C) + k = 0 + 1 = 1$\n- $f_1(C,A) = f_0(C,A) + k = 0 + 1 = 1$\n- All other flows remain $0$.\n\nAfter this augmentation, the residual capacity of edge $(C,A)$ becomes $u_{f_1}(C,A) = u_{f_0}(C,A) - k = 1 - 1 = 0$. This saturates the edge $(C,A)$ and breaks the cycle $\\gamma_1$. There are no other negative-cost cycles. Thus, the flow $f_1$ is the new optimal flow.\n\nThe new optimal total cost, $C_{\\text{new}}$, is the cost of the flow $f_1$ evaluated with the new edge costs $c'$:\n$$C_{\\text{new}} = \\sum_e c'(e) f_1(e)$$\n$$C_{\\text{new}} = c'(A,B)f_1(A,B) + c(B,C)f_1(B,C) + c(C,A)f_1(C,A)$$\n$$C_{\\text{new}} = (-5)(1) + (1)(1) + (2)(1) = -5 + 1 + 2 = -2$$\n\nThe decrease in the optimal total cost is the difference between the old optimal cost and the new optimal cost:\n$$\\text{Decrease} = C_{\\text{old}} - C_{\\text{new}} = 0 - (-2) = 2$$\n\nFinal verification: The change in cost can also be calculated as the product of the augmenting flow and the cost of the negative cycle: $k \\times |C'(\\gamma_1)| = 1 \\times |-2| = 2$. This represents the total reduction in cost when starting from a state with total cost $C'_{0}$ (cost of flow $f_0$ under new prices $c'$) which equals $0$ since $f_0=0$.\n\nThe total decrease in cost from the initial state (cost $C_{\\text{old}}$ under prices $c$) to the final state (cost $C_{\\text{new}}$ under prices $c'$) is indeed $2$.",
