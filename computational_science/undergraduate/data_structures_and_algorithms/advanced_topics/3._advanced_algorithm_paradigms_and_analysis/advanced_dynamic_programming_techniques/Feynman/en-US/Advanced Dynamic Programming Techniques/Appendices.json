Interpret $S$ as an ordered sequence $S=(s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_n)$ with $n=|S|$, where indices are used to distinguish elements even if their values are equal. An integer target $T$ is also given. Define a subset by its index set $X\\subseteq\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$. A subset $X$ is said to realize $T$ if $\\sum_{i\\in X}s_i=T$. Your task is to compute the number of index-distinct subsets $X$ that realize $T$, where each $s_i$ can be used at most once. The input for this task is fixed within the program via a test suite; there is no user input. This is a purely mathematical and algorithmic problem, so no physical units apply.\n\nFundamental base to be used in reasoning: the dynamic programming principle, which starts from the well-tested facts that combinatorial counting over independent choices can be decomposed into subproblems, and that subproblems can be structured by partitioning the choice space. In particular, the relevant base includes the definitions of state spaces, the principle of optimal substructure, and the existence of overlapping subproblems when counting subsets by partial sums.\n\nYour program must evaluate a test suite composed of the following parameter sets $(S,T)$, where $S$ is written as a list and $T$ is written as an integer:\n- Test case $1$: $S=[3,34,4,12,5,2]$, $T=9$.\n- Test case $2$: $S=[0,0,0]$, $T=0$.\n- Test case $3$: $S=[-1,1,2,-2,3]$, $T=0$.\n- Test case $4$: $S=[1,1,1,1]$, $T=2$.\n- Test case $5$: $S=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]$ (that is, $|S|=20$ and every entry equals $1$), $T=10$.\n- Test case $6$: $S=[5,6,7]$, $T=1$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the test suite as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The $i$-th entry must be the number of index-distinct subsets of $S$ that sum to $T$ for test case $i$. For example, the format must be $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r_5,r_6]$ where each $r_i$ is an integer.",
            "solution": "The provided problem is a well-defined combinatorial counting task. It asks for the number of index-distinct subsets of a given sequence of integers $S = (s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n)$ whose elements sum to a target value $T$. The elements of $S$ are distinguished by their indices, even if their numerical values are identical.\n\nFirst, the problem statement is validated.\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- An ordered sequence of integers $S=(s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_n)$ with $n=|S|\\le 20$.\n- An integer target $T$.\n- A subset is defined by its index set $X\\subseteq\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$.\n- A subset $X$ realizes $T$ if $\\sum_{i\\in X}s_i=T$.\n- The task is to compute the number of such index-distinct subsets $X$.\n- The fundamental base for reasoning is specified as the dynamic programming principle.\n- A fixed test suite of $6$ cases is provided.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound. It is a variant of the classic Subset Sum Problem, a well-known problem in computer science and mathematics. The problem is self-contained, objective, and unambiguous. The constraint $n \\le 20$ is a critical piece of information that guides the choice of a suitable algorithm. All terms are formally defined. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution follows.\n\n**Principle-Based Solution Derivation**\nThe problem is to count subsets, which suggests a combinatorial approach. For each element $s_i$ in the sequence $S$, we can make a binary choice: either include $s_i$ in our subset or exclude it. This structure of independent choices is a hallmark of problems amenable to dynamic programming.\n\nLet us define a function $C(i, t)$ as the number of subsets of the suffix sequence $(s_i, s_{i+1}, \\dots, s_n)$ that sum to a value $t$. Our goal is to compute $C(1, T)$.\n\nThe decision for element $s_i$ leads to the following recurrence relation:\n1.  **Exclude $s_i$**: If we do not include $s_i$ in our subset, we must find a subset of the remaining elements $(s_{i+1}, \\dots, s_n)$ that sums to the same target $t$. The number of ways to do this is $C(i+1, t)$.\n2.  **Include $s_i$**: If we include $s_i$, we must find a subset of the remaining elements $(s_{i+1}, \\dots, s_n)$ that sums to the adjusted target $t - s_i$. The number of ways is $C(i+1, t - s_i)$.\n\nBy the principle of addition for disjoint choices, the total number of ways is the sum of these two cases:\n$$C(i, t) = C(i+1, t) + C(i+1, t - s_i)$$\n\nThe base cases for the recursion are:\n-   If $t=0$, we have found a valid combination of elements. We count this as $1$ solution. This signifies that the choices made up to this point result in the desired sum. (Note: A more rigorous base case is at the end of the sequence).\n-   A more formal set of base cases occurs when we have considered all elements (i.e., when $i > n$):\n    -   $C(n+1, 0) = 1$ (The empty set sums to $0$, representing a successful path).\n    -   $C(n+1, t) = 0$ for $t \\neq 0$ (We have failed to reach the target sum of $0$).\n\nThis recursive formulation has overlapping subproblems, as the same state $(i, t)$ can be reached through different sequences of choices. A direct implementation would be inefficient. We can use memoization (a top-down dynamic programming approach) to store and reuse the results for each state $(i, t)$. The complexity of this approach is proportional to the number of states, which is approximately $O(n \\cdot \\Delta)$, where $\\Delta$ is the range of possible intermediate target values. While often efficient, this pseudo-polynomial complexity can be problematic if the values in $S$, and thus $\\Delta$, are large.\n\nHowever, the problem provides a crucial constraint: $|S| = n \\le 20$. This constraint makes an exponential-time complexity solution in $n$ feasible. Specifically, an algorithm with complexity $O(n \\cdot 2^n)$ is acceptable. For $n=20$, $2^{20} \\approx 10^6$, and $20 \\cdot 2^{20} \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^7$, which is well within the limits of modern processors.\n\nThis leads to a second, more direct approach that leverages the small value of $n$, often categorized under \"bitmask DP\". We can represent each of the $2^n$ possible subsets of indices using an $n$-bit integer, called a bitmask. For a mask $m$, if the $j$-th bit is set to $1$, it signifies that the element $s_{j+1}$ is included in the subset; if the bit is $0$, it is excluded.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize a counter for valid subsets to $0$.\n2.  Iterate through all integers $m$ from $0$ to $2^n - 1$. Each integer $m$ is a bitmask representing a unique subset of $S$.\n3.  For each mask $m$, calculate the sum of the corresponding subset. This is done by iterating from $j=0$ to $n-1$: if the $j$-th bit of $m$ is set, add $s_{j+1}$ to a running `current_sum`.\n4.  If the `current_sum` equals the target $T$, increment the counter.\n5.  After checking all $2^n$ masks, the value of the counter is the final answer.\n\nThis approach exhaustively checks every subset. It can be viewed as a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where we compute the sum for every possible subset. The sum for a subset (mask) can be derived from the sum of a smaller subset (sub-mask), e.g., $\\text{sum}[\\text{mask}] = \\text{sum}[\\text{mask\\_without\\_lowest\\_bit}] + s[\\text{lowest\\_bit\\_index}]$. However, a direct loop-based calculation of each sum is just as efficient and simpler to implement. Given the problem's hint towards \"bitmask dp\" and the constraint $n \\le 20$, this bitmask-based enumeration is the most direct and robust method.\n\nFor example, for $S=[1,1,1,1]$ and $T=2$ ($n=4$), we need to find subsets that sum to $2$. This is equivalent to choosing exactly two elements since all values are $1$. The number of ways to choose $2$ indices from $4$ is $\\binom{4}{2}=6$. The bitmask approach will iterate from $m=0$ (`0000` in binary) to $m=15$ (`1111`). It will find that the masks with exactly two bits set (`0011`, `0101`, `0110`, `1001`, `1010`, `1100`) correspond to subsets whose elements sum to $2$, yielding the correct count of $6$.",

You are also given an integer $K \\ge 1$ representing the number of available colors, with color indices taken as $\\{0,1,\\dots,K-1\\}$.

A vertex coloring function is a mapping $c:\\{1,\\dots,N\\} \\to \\{0,1,\\dots,K-1\\}$. A coloring is proper if for every edge $(u,v)$, the property $c(u) \\ne c(v)$ holds, and is admissible if for every vertex $i$, the assigned color $c(i)$ is allowed by its mask $M_i$ (i.e., the $c(i)$-th bit of $M_i$ is 1).

This problem is a classic application of Tree Dynamic Programming.\n\n**1. Formalizing the Problem**\nLet the tree be $T=(V, E)$, where $V=\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. Let the set of available colors be $C = \\{0, 1, \\dots, K-1\\}$. For each vertex $i \\in V$, the set of admissible colors is $A_i = \\{j \\in C \\mid ((M_i \\gg j) \\ 1) = 1 \\}$. We seek the number of functions $c: V \\to C$ such that:\n$1$.  **Admissibility**: $\\forall i \\in V, c(i) \\in A_i$.\n$2$.  **Properness**: $\\forall (u, v) \\in E, c(u) \\neq c(v)$.\n\n**2. Dynamic Programming on a Tree**\nThe tree structure is key. If we root the tree at an arbitrary vertex, say vertex $1$, we can define subproblems on the subtrees. The coloring choices for disjoint subtrees become independent once the color of their common parent is fixed. This motivates a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet's define the DP state. For each vertex $u \\in V$ and each color $j \\in C$, let $dp[u][j]$ be the number of ways to color the subtree rooted at $u$ (including $u$ itself) such that vertex $u$ is assigned color $j$, and the coloring of the entire subtree is proper and admissible.\n\nThe DP values are computed using a post-order traversal (from leaves up to the root).\n\n**3. DP State Transition**\n\n**Base Case (Leaf Nodes):**\nA leaf node $u$ has no children. Its subtree consists only of itself. The only constraints are on the color of $u$. Thus, we can color $u$ with color $j$ in exactly one way if $j$ is an admissible color for $u$.\n$$\ndp[u][j] = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } j \\in A_u \\\\ 0  \\text{if } j \\notin A_u \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Recursive Step (Internal Nodes):**\nFor an internal node $u$, let its children in the rooted tree be $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m$. To calculate $dp[u][j]$, we first check if color $j$ is admissible for $u$. If $j \\notin A_u$, then $dp[u][j] = 0$.\nIf $j \\in A_u$, we must color the subtrees of its children. For any child $v_i$, it must be colored with any admissible color $k$ as long as $k \\neq j$. The number of ways to color the subtree of $v_i$ under this constraint is the sum of $dp[v_i][k]$ over all valid colors $k \\neq j$.\n$$\n\\text{Ways for child } v_i = \\sum_{k \\in C, k \\neq j} dp[v_i][k]\n$$\nSince the coloring choices for the subtrees of different children are independent of each other (once the parent's color $j$ is fixed), we multiply the number of ways for each child's subtree.\n$$\ndp[u][j] = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{k \\in C, k \\neq j} dp[v_i][k] \\right) \\pmod{1000000007}\n$$\nFor computational efficiency, the sum can be calculated as:\n$$\n\\sum_{k \\in C, k \\neq j} dp[v_i][k] = \\left( \\left(\\sum_{k \\in C} dp[v_i][k]\\right) - dp[v_i][j] \\right) \\pmod{1000000007}\n$$\nThis avoids a loop of size $K$ for each child and each parent color, reducing the complexity of the transition.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nThe computation can be implemented with a single Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the root. The DFS function processes a node after all its children have been processed. Once the DFS completes and the DP table is filled for all nodes, the total number of valid colorings for the entire tree is the sum of the DP values for the root node over all its possible colors. Let vertex $r$ be the root.\n$$\n\\text{Total Colorings} = \\sum_{j \\in C} dp[r][j] \\pmod{1000000007}\n$$\nAll arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$.",

            "introduction": "This final exercise deepens our understanding of Tree DP with a more challenging counting problem. Here, we must count all connected subgraphs of a specific size, which requires a more sophisticated state transition than simple coloring. The solution involves a 'knapsack-style' DP on the tree, where we combine subproblems from children in a combinatorial fashion to build up solutions for the parent. ",

            "problem": "You are given an undirected tree $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|=N$ vertices labeled from $1$ to $N$, and $|E|=N-1$ edges. A tree is defined as a connected, acyclic graph. For an integer $K$, a connected subgraph of size exactly $K$ is defined as a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$ with $|S|=K$ such that the subgraph induced by $S$ is connected (that is, for every pair of vertices in $S$, there is a path entirely within $S$ connecting them). The task is to count the number of distinct connected induced subgraphs of size exactly $K$. All counts are pure integers with no physical units.\n\nBase principles to rely on:\n- The definition of a tree: a connected, acyclic, undirected graph.\n- The property of trees that between any two vertices there exists a unique simple path.\n- The concept of an induced subgraph: for $S \\subseteq V$, the induced subgraph on $S$ contains all vertices in $S$ and all edges $(u,v) \\in E$ such that $u \\in S$ and $v \\in S$.\n\nYour program must compute the count for each of the following test cases. Each test case is specified by $N$, $K$, and a set of edges. Vertices are labeled from $1$ to $N$.\n\nTest suite:\n1. Case $\\mathrm{A}$: $N=7$, $K=3$, edges $\\{(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,6),(3,7)\\}$.\n2. Case $\\mathrm{B}$: $N=5$, $K=2$, edges $\\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5)\\}$.\n3. Case $\\mathrm{C}$: $N=5$, $K=3$, edges $\\{(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5)\\}$.\n4. Case $\\mathrm{D}$: $N=1$, $K=1$, edges $\\{\\}$.\n5. Case $\\mathrm{E}$: $N=3$, $K=0$, edges $\\{(1,2),(2,3)\\}$. For $K=0$, the count is defined to be $0$ since no non-empty connected subgraph has size $0$.\n6. Case $\\mathrm{F}$: $N=6$, $K=6$, edges $\\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6)\\}$.\n7. Case $\\mathrm{G}$: $N=4$, $K=5$, edges $\\{(1,2),(1,3),(1,4)\\}$. For $K>N$, the count is defined to be $0$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[r_1,r_2,r_3,\\dots]$), where $r_i$ is the integer count for the $i$-th test case in the order listed above. No other output should be produced. No angles or physical units are involved in this task. All outputs are integers.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is a well-defined combinatorial counting problem in the domain of graph theory. All terms are standard, and the test cases are consistent and verifiable. The problem is valid and can be solved using established algorithmic techniques.\n\nThe task is to count the number of distinct connected induced subgraphs of a given size $K$ in a tree $G=(V, E)$, where $|V|=N$. A brute-force check of all $\\binom{N}{K}$ vertex subsets is computationally prohibitive. The tree structure of the graph suggests a dynamic programming approach on the tree, often referred to as Tree DP.\n\nA fundamental property of a connected subgraph $S$ within a tree $G$ is that $S$ is itself a tree. If we root the main tree $G$ at an arbitrary vertex $r$, any connected subgraph $S$ will possess a unique \"highest\" vertex, which is the vertex in $S$ that is an ancestor of all other vertices in $S$ with respect to the root $r$. This unique vertex can be designated as the \"root\" of the subgraph $S$.\n\nThis observation allows us to partition the set of all connected subgraphs based on their unique root, ensuring that each subgraph is counted exactly once. The total count is the sum, over all vertices $u \\in V$, of the number of connected subgraphs of size $K$ that are rooted at $u$.\n\nWe formulate a dynamic programming state to compute these counts. Let's fix an arbitrary root for the entire tree $G$, for instance, vertex $1$. We will then perform a post-order traversal (DFS) from this root. For each vertex $u$, our DP state will capture information about subgraphs rooted at $u$.\n\nLet $dp[u][k]$ denote the number of connected subgraphs of size $k$ that are entirely contained within the subtree of $G$ rooted at $u$ and which themselves are rooted at $u$.\n\nThe DP values are computed via a post-order traversal:\n\n**Base Case:** For any leaf vertex $u$, the only connected subgraph rooted at $u$ within its own subtree is the one consisting of a single vertex, $\\{u\\}$. Therefore, $dp[u][1] = 1$, and $dp[u][k] = 0$ for all $k > 1$.\n\n**Recursive Step:** For an internal vertex $u$, we initialize its DP table based on the subgraph containing only itself: $dp[u][1] = 1$ and $dp[u][k] = 0$ for $k > 1$. We then iterate through each of its children, say $v_i$, and merge the DP information from the child's subtree into the parent's DP table.\n\nWhen processing a child $v_i$, we have already computed its DP table $dp[v_i]$. A new, larger connected subgraph rooted at $u$ can be formed by combining an existing connected subgraph of size $k_1$ rooted at $u$ (constructed using $u$ and its previously processed children) with a connected subgraph of size $k_2$ rooted at $v_i$. The connection is established via the edge $(u, v_i)$. The resulting subgraph is rooted at $u$ and has a new size of $k_1 + k_2$. The number of ways to form such a subgraph is the product $dp[u][k_1] \\times dp[v_i][k_2]$.\n\nThis combination process is performed for each child sequentially. Let $dp_{u, \\text{old}}$ be the DP array for $u$ before merging child $v_i$. The new DP array, $dp_{u, \\text{new}}$, is computed as follows:\n$$dp_{u, \\text{new}}[k] = dp_{u, \\text{old}}[k] + \\sum_{k_1+k_2=k} dp_{u, \\text{old}}[k_1] \\times dp_{v_i}[k_2]$$\nThe first term, $dp_{u, \\text{old}}[k]$, accounts for subgraphs rooted at $u$ that do not include any vertices from the subtree of $v_i$. The summation accounts for new subgraphs formed by including a connected component from $v_i$'s subtree.\n\nAfter the post-order traversal completes, the $dp[u][k]$ table is finalized for every vertex $u$. The total number of connected subgraphs of size $K$ in the entire tree is the sum over all possible roots: $\\sum_{u \\in V} dp[u][K]$.\n\nThe time complexity is dominated by the DP merge operations. At each edge $(u, v)$ in the traversal, we perform an operation analogous to a convolution of two arrays of sizes proportional to the respective subtree sizes. The sum of these products of subtree sizes over all edges of a tree is bounded by $O(N^2)$. The space complexity is $O(N^2)$ to store the DP tables for all $N$ vertices, where each table can have up to $N+1$ entries.\n\nSpecial cases where $K=0$ or $K>N$ are handled directly as per the problem statement, with the count being $0$.",
