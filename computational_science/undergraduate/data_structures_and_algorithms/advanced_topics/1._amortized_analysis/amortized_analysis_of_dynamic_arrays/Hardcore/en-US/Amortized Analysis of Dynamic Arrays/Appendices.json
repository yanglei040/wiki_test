To build intuition, it can be helpful to change our perspective and trace the \"journey\" of a single element through successive resizes. This exercise asks you to determine the maximum number of times any one element could be copied, which naturally focuses on the very first element added to the array. By tracking its experience, you can gain a concrete understanding of how the cost of copying is distributed over the array's lifetime. ",

            "problem": "Consider a dynamic array that initially has capacity $1$ and is empty. The array supports an append operation that places a new element at the end in constant time when unused capacity is available. When an append finds the array full, the array performs a resize: it allocates a new contiguous block whose capacity is exactly double the current capacity, and then copies all current elements from the old block into the new block in order, after which the new element is appended. Assume no deletions occur. Define a “copy” of an element to mean a movement of that element during a resize (the initial placement of an element when it is appended does not count as a copy).\n\nAfter performing exactly $N \\ge 1$ appends, determine, as a closed-form expression in terms of $N$, the maximum possible number of times that any single element has been copied due solely to resizes during this sequence of $N$ appends.

New capacity is allocated as $2 \\times$ current capacity.\n    2. All existing elements are copied to the new block.\n    3. The new element is then appended.\n- Definition of \"copy\": Movement of an element during a resize. The initial insertion of an element is not a copy.\n- Total operations: Exactly $N$ appends are performed, with $N \\ge 1$.\n- Objective: Determine the maximum possible number of times any single element has been copied.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is a standard exercise in the analysis of algorithms, specifically concerning the amortized analysis of a dynamic array (also known as a vector or ArrayList). The model described (doubling capacity on resize) is a classic implementation strategy. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The initial conditions, the rules for operation, and the quantity to be determined are all specified precisely. A unique, deterministic solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem statement is objective and uses formal, unambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined question in the field of computer science about data structures and algorithms. I will now proceed with a formal solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of times any single element has been copied after a sequence of $N$ append operations. To maximize the number of copies for an element, we should consider an element that has been present in the array for the longest possible duration, as it would be subject to every resize operation that occurs after its insertion. The first element to be appended, let us call it $E_1$, satisfies this condition. Therefore, the maximum number of copies for any element is the number of times $E_1$ is copied.\n\nLet's analyze the state of the dynamic array, specifically its capacity. The capacity, let's denote it by $C$, changes only during resize operations. According to the problem statement, the initial capacity is $C_0 = 1$. A resize operation doubles the capacity. Thus, the sequence of capacities the array can have are powers of $2$: $1, 2, 4, 8, \\dots, 2^k$ for non-negative integers $k$. A capacity of $C=2^k$ can hold up to $2^k$ elements.\n\nA resize is triggered when an append operation is attempted on an array that is full. That is, if the array has a capacity of $C$ and already contains $C$ elements, the next append causes a resize.\n\nLet us trace the process:\n1.  **Initial State**: Capacity $C=1$, size $S=0$.\n2.  **Append 1**: We append element $E_1$. The array has space, so no resize occurs. The state becomes $C=1$, $S=1$. The number of copies for $E_1$ is $0$.\n3.  **Append 2**: We try to append $E_2$. The array is full ($S=C=1$). A resize is triggered.\n    - A new array of capacity $2 \\times 1 = 2$ is allocated.\n    - Element $E_1$ is copied from the old array to the new one. This is the **first copy** of $E_1$.\n    - Element $E_2$ is appended.\n    - The state becomes $C=2$, $S=2$.\n4.  **Append 3**: We try to append $E_3$. The array is full ($S=C=2$). A resize is triggered.\n    - A new array of capacity $2 \\times 2 = 4$ is allocated.\n    - Elements $E_1$ and $E_2$ are copied. This is the **second copy** of $E_1$.\n    - Element $E_3$ is appended.\n    - The state becomes $C=4$, $S=3$.\n5.  **Append 4**: We append $E_4$. The array is not full ($S=3, C=4$). No resize. State becomes $C=4, S=4$. $E_1$ has still been copied twice.\n6.  **Append 5**: We try to append $E_5$. The array is full ($S=C=4$). A resize is triggered to capacity $2 \\times 4 = 8$. This involves the **third copy** of $E_1$.\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that $E_1$ is copied on every resize event that happens after its initial placement. The number of times $E_1$ is copied is therefore equal to the total number of resizes that occur during the $N$ appends.\n\nA resize from capacity $2^k$ to $2^{k+1}$ is triggered by the $(2^k+1)$-th append operation. Element $E_1$ is present for all resizes that increase the capacity from its initial value of $2^0$.\n\nAfter $N$ appends, the array must hold $N$ elements. The capacity of the array, $C_N$, must be at least $N$. Since capacities are powers of two, $C_N$ must be the smallest power of two that is greater than or equal to $N$. Let this capacity be $C_N = 2^k$.\nThe condition $C_N = 2^k \\ge N$ with $k$ being the smallest such integer implies that the previous capacity, $2^{k-1}$, was insufficient, i.e., $2^{k-1}  N$.\nSo, we have the inequality:\n$$2^{k-1}  N \\le 2^k$$\nThis inequality holds for $N > 1$. If $N=1$, the capacity is $1=2^0$, so $k=0$.\nFor $N > 1$, we can take the logarithm base $2$ of the inequality:\n$$\\log_2(2^{k-1})  \\log_2(N) \\le \\log_2(2^k)$$\n$$k-1  \\log_2(N) \\le k$$\nThis relationship is the definition of the ceiling function. Thus, for $N > 1$, the exponent $k$ of the final capacity is given by:\n$$k = \\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil$$\nLet's check this for $N=1$. The final capacity is $1 = 2^0$, so $k=0$. The formula gives $\\lceil \\log_2(1) \\rceil = \\lceil 0 \\rceil = 0$. So the formula holds for all $N \\ge 1$.\n\nThe sequence of capacities that the array must adopt to reach a capacity of $2^k$ is $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\ldots, 2^k$.\nEach step in this sequence from $2^j$ to $2^{j+1}$ for $j=0, 1, \\ldots, k-1$ corresponds to one resize operation.\nThe first element, $E_1$, is present in the array from the point where the capacity is $C=2^0$. It will be copied in every subsequent resize. The resizes are:\n- from $2^0 \\to 2^1$\n- from $2^1 \\to 2^2$\n- ...\n- from $2^{k-1} \\to 2^k$\n\nThe total number of these resize events is $(k-1) - 0 + 1 = k$.\nTherefore, the maximum number of times any single element is copied is $k$. Substituting the expression for $k$:\n$$\\text{Maximum copies} = \\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil$$\nThis expression is a closed form in terms of $N$ and is valid for all $N \\ge 1$.",

            "introduction": "The conclusion that a doubling strategy yields constant amortized cost for appends is powerful, but it rests on a key assumption: the cost of copying $k$ elements is linear, i.e., proportional to $k$. What happens if this assumption doesn't hold? This thought experiment explores a scenario with a non-linear, quadratic copy cost ($k^2$), forcing you to re-derive the amortized cost from first principles. By working through this problem, you will see that the efficiency of a dynamic array is not just about the growth factor, but is deeply tied to the underlying cost model of its operations. ",

            "problem": "You are given a dynamic array that stores items contiguously. The array starts empty with initial capacity $1$. Every time an append operation would overflow the current capacity, the array resizes by allocating a new array with capacity doubled to $2$ times the current capacity and then migrates all existing elements into the new array in order.\n\nThe cost model is as follows: each append operation that writes a single element into an available slot costs $1$ unit; when a resize occurs, copying $k$ existing elements into the new array costs $k^2$ units (in addition to the $1$ unit cost for the append that triggers the resize). You perform exactly $n$ append operations, where $n$ is a power of $2$ (that is, $n = 2^t$ for some integer $t \\ge 0$).\n\nUsing only the fundamental definition that the amortized cost per operation equals the total cost divided by the number of operations, and the specified resizing policy, derive the exact amortized cost per append as a function of $n$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the exact amortized cost per append operation for a sequence of $n$ appends into a dynamic array, where $n$ is a power of $2$ ($n = 2^t$ for some integer $t \\ge 0$). The amortized cost is defined as the total cost divided by the number of operations.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total cost for performing $n$ append operations. The total cost, $C_{total}$, is the sum of two components: the total cost of all append operations and the total cost of all resize-and-copy operations.\n\nThe cost model is specified as:\n1.  Base append cost: Each append operation costs $1$ unit to write the element into an available slot.\n2.  Resize cost: When a resize is triggered, copying $k$ existing elements costs $k^2$ units. This is in addition to the $1$ unit for the append that triggers it.\n\nTotal base append cost:\nSince there are exactly $n$ append operations, and each has a base cost of $1$, the total base append cost is $n \\times 1 = n$.\n\nTotal resize cost:\nA resize occurs when an append is attempted on a full array. The array starts with an initial capacity of $1$. The capacity doubles upon each resize.\nLet's trace the state of the array, specifically its size (number of elements) and capacity.\n-   Initially, size is $0$ and capacity is $1$.\n-   Append #$1$: The size becomes $1$. The array is now full.\n-   Append #$2$: This triggers the first resize because size ($1$) equals capacity ($1$). The number of elements to copy is $k=1$. The new capacity will be $2 \\times 1 = 2$. The cost for this copy is $k^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n-   Append #$3$: The size is $2$ and capacity is $2$. This triggers a resize. The number of elements to copy is $k=2$. The new capacity will be $2 \\times 2 = 4$. The cost for this copy is $k^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\n-   Append #$5$: The size is $4$ and capacity is $4$. This triggers a resize. The number of elements to copy is $k=4$. The new capacity will be $2 \\times 4 = 8$. The cost for this copy is $k^2 = 4^2 = 16$.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can generalize. A resize is triggered when the number of elements in the array is a power of $2$, say $2^j$, and we need to append a new element. The number of elements to copy is $k=2^j$. The cost of this single resize operation is $k^2 = (2^j)^2 = 4^j$.\n\nWe are performing $n=2^t$ append operations in total. The sizes of the array that will trigger a resize are $1, 2, 4, \\dots, 2^{t-1}$.\n-   When size is $1=2^0$, the next append triggers a resize. Copy cost is $(2^0)^2 = 4^0$. This happens for $j=0$.\n-   When size is $2=2^1$, the next append triggers a resize. Copy cost is $(2^1)^2 = 4^1$. This happens for $j=1$.\n-   This continues until the size is $2^{t-1}$. The next append (operation number $2^{t-1}+1$) triggers a resize to a capacity of $2 \\times 2^{t-1} = 2^t$. The number of elements to copy is $k=2^{t-1}$, and the cost is $(2^{t-1})^2 = 4^{t-1}$. This corresponds to $j=t-1$.\n\nAfter the final append operation, number $n=2^t$, the array will have a size of $2^t$ and a capacity of $2^t$. No further resize is performed within this sequence of $n$ operations. Therefore, the resizes correspond to $j$ from $0$ to $t-1$.\n\nThe total resize cost, $C_{resize}$, is the sum of the costs of all these resize operations:\n$$C_{resize} = \\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} (2^j)^2 = \\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} 4^j$$\nThis is a finite geometric series with $t$ terms, a first term of $4^0=1$, and a common ratio of $4$. The sum is given by the formula $\\frac{r^{\\text{number of terms}} - 1}{r-1}$.\n$$C_{resize} = \\frac{4^t - 1}{4 - 1} = \\frac{4^t - 1}{3}$$\nThis calculation is valid for $t \\ge 1$. If $t=0$, then $n=1$, the sum is empty and its value is $0$. Our formula gives $\\frac{4^0-1}{3}=0$, so it holds for $t=0$ as well.\n\nNow, we can find the total cost, $C_{total}$, by adding the total base append cost and the total resize cost:\n$$C_{total} = (\\text{Total Append Cost}) + (\\text{Total Resize Cost}) = n + \\frac{4^t - 1}{3}$$\n\nTo express this purely in terms of $n$, we use the given relation $n=2^t$. Squaring both sides gives $n^2 = (2^t)^2 = 2^{2t} = (2^2)^t = 4^t$.\nSubstituting $4^t = n^2$ into the expression for $C_{total}$:\n$$C_{total} = n + \\frac{n^2 - 1}{3}$$\n\nFinally, the amortized cost per append, $A(n)$, is the total cost divided by the number of operations, $n$.\n$$A(n) = \\frac{C_{total}}{n} = \\frac{n + \\frac{n^2 - 1}{3}}{n}$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$A(n) = \\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{n^2 - 1}{3n} = 1 + \\frac{n^2 - 1}{3n}$$\nTo write this as a single fraction, we find a common denominator:\n$$A(n) = \\frac{3n}{3n} + \\frac{n^2 - 1}{3n} = \\frac{3n + n^2 - 1}{3n}$$\nReordering the terms in the numerator gives the final simplified expression:\n$$A(n) = \\frac{n^2 + 3n - 1}{3n}$$\nThis is the exact amortized cost per append as a single simplified closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$.",

The aggregate method calculates the total cost of the sequence of operations and divides by the number of operations.\n\nLet `$S$` be the number of elements in the dynamic array (its size), and let `$C$` be its capacity.\nThe initial state of the array is given as size `$s_0 \\geq 1$` and capacity `$c_0 = s_0$`.\nThe sequence of `$2m$` operations is an alternating sequence of `append` and `pop`, starting with `append`.\n\nLet us analyze the cost and the state of the array for a single pair of `append` followed by `pop` operations.
