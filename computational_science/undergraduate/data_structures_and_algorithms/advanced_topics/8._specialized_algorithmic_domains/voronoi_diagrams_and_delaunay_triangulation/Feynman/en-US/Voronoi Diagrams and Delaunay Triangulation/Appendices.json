            "problem": "Design and implement an algorithm that, given a finite set of planar points and a triangulation over these points, verifies in linear time whether the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation. Use the following foundational base: the definition of the Delaunay triangulation as the triangulation in which, for every triangle, the open circumcircle contains no other input point; the equivalence between the Delaunay triangulation and the straight-line dual graph of the Voronoi diagram; and the well-tested local Delaunay edge legality criterion derived from the empty circumcircle property. The objective is to derive, from these foundations, an $O(n)$ test where $n$ is the number of points.\n\nYou must reason from first principles, starting with the definition of the Delaunay triangulation. The derivation must not assume shortcut formulas not justified from the base. The triangulation is represented as a list of triangles, where each triangle is a triple of zero-based indices into the point array, and each point is represented by its Cartesian coordinates. Angles, when discussed, must be understood in radians; however, the algorithm should be based on the empty circumcircle property and operate without explicitly computing angles.

            "solution": "The problem requires designing and implementing a linear-time algorithm to verify if a given planar triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation.\n\n### Step 1: Foundational Principles and Derivation of the Method\n\nA triangulation of a point set $P$ is defined as a Delaunay triangulation if and only if it satisfies the **empty circumcircle property**: for every triangle $T$ in the triangulation, the open circumscribing circle of $T$ contains no point from the set $P$.\n\nA direct verification of this global property would require checking every point in $P$ against the circumcircle of every triangle in the triangulation. Given $n$ points and $O(n)$ triangles, this approach would lead to an $O(n^2)$ complexity, which is too slow for the stated requirement of $O(n)$.\n\nTo achieve linear time complexity, we must leverage a local property that is equivalent to the global Delaunay property. A fundamental theorem in computational geometry states that a triangulation is Delaunay if and only if every interior edge of the triangulation is **locally Delaunay** (or \"legal\"). An edge on the boundary of the triangulation (i.e., on the convex hull of the point set) is always considered legal.\n\nThis reduces the problem to testing the legality of each interior edge. An interior edge $\\overline{ab}$ is shared by two adjacent triangles, say $\\triangle abc$ and $\\triangle abd$, which together form a convex quadrilateral $acbd$. The edge $\\overline{ab}$ is locally Delaunay if the point $d$ does not lie inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle abc$. By symmetry, this is equivalent to the condition that point $c$ does not lie inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle abd$. If the four points $a, b, c, d$ are co-circular, the edge is also considered legal, as either diagonal of the quadrilateral is permissible.\n\nThe test of whether a point $d=(x_d, y_d)$ lies inside, on, or outside the circumcircle of a triangle $\\triangle abc$ with vertices $a=(x_a, y_a)$, $b=(x_b, y_b)$, and $c=(x_c, y_c)$ can be performed without explicitly computing the circle's center or radius. This is achieved using the `in-circle` predicate, which evaluates the sign of a determinant. Assuming the vertices $a, b, c$ are ordered counter-clockwise (CCW), point $d$ is inside the circumcircle if the following determinant is positive:\n\n$$\n\\text{InCircle}(a,b,c,d) = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\nx_a & y_a & x_a^2 + y_a^2 & 1 \\\\\nx_b & y_b & x_b^2 + y_b^2 & 1 \\\\\nx_c & y_c & x_c^2 + y_c^2 & 1 \\\\\nx_d & y_d & x_d^2 + y_d^2 & 1\n\\end{vmatrix} > 0\n$$\n\nTo improve numerical stability, this $4 \\times 4$ determinant is typically reformulated as a $3 \\times 3$ determinant by subtracting the coordinates of point $d$ from the other three points:\n\n$$\n\\text{InCircle}(a,b,c,d) = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\nx_a - x_d & y_a - y_d & (x_a-x_d)^2 + (y_a-y_d)^2 \\\\\nx_b - x_d & y_b - y_d & (x_b-x_d)^2 + (y_b-y_d)^2 \\\\\nx_c - x_d & y_c - y_d & (x_c-x_d)^2 + (y_c-y_d)^2\n\\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe sign of this determinant depends on the orientation (clockwise or counter-clockwise) of the triangle $\\triangle abc$. Let the orientation be determined by:\n$$\n\\text{orientation}(a,b,c) = (x_b - x_a)(y_c - y_a) - (y_b - y_a)(x_c - x_a)\n$$\nA positive value indicates CCW order, a negative value indicates CW order, and zero indicates collinearity.\n\nAn edge $\\overline{ab}$ shared by $\\triangle abc$ and $\\triangle abd$ is illegal if point $d$ is strictly inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle abc$. This condition holds if and only if the product $\\text{orientation}(a,b,c) \\times \\text{InCircle}(a,b,c,d)$ is positive. To account for floating-point arithmetic, we check if this product is greater than a small positive tolerance $\\varepsilon$. If it is, the edge is illegal, and the entire triangulation is not Delaunay.\n\n### Step 2: Algorithmic Design for $O(n)$ Complexity\n\nBased on the principles above, the linear-time verification algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Adjacency Mapping**: The first step is to identify all interior edges. An interior edge is one that is shared by exactly two triangles. To find these efficiently, we construct a hash map (a dictionary in Python) where keys represent edges and values are lists of the indices of the triangles containing that edge. An edge can be canonically represented by a sorted tuple of its endpoint indices, e.g., `(min(i,j), max(i,j))`, to ensure that the edge from $i$ to $j$ is treated the same as the edge from $j$ to $i$. We iterate through all input triangles. For each of the three edges of a triangle, we add the triangle's index to the list associated with that edge's canonical key in the hash map. Since a planar triangulation with $n$ vertices has $O(n)$ triangles and $O(n)$ edges, this construction process takes $O(n)$ time.\n\n2.  **Edge Legality Testing**: We then iterate through the hash map. For each edge key, we examine its corresponding list of triangle indices.\n    *   If the list contains only one index, the edge is a boundary edge and requires no test.\n    *   If the list contains two indices, say `t1` and `t2`, the edge is an interior edge. Let this edge connect vertices $u$ and $v$. The triangle `t1` will have vertices $(u, v, c)$ and triangle `t2` will have vertices $(u, v, d)$ for some other vertices $c$ and $d$. The points $c$ and $d$ are the vertices opposite the shared edge.\n\n3.  **Local Delaunay Test**: For each interior edge $(u,v)$ with opposite vertices $c$ and $d$, we perform the `in-circle` test. Let the four points be $P_u, P_v, P_c, P_d$. We test if $P_d$ is inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle P_u P_v P_c$.\n    *   We compute the orientation of $(P_u, P_v, P_c)$.\n    *   We compute the value of the $3 \\times 3$ `in-circle` determinant for the points $(P_u, P_v, P_c, P_d)$.\n    *   If the product of the orientation and the determinant is greater than a small numerical tolerance $\\varepsilon$, the edge is illegal. We can immediately conclude the triangulation is not Delaunay and terminate, returning `False`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: If the algorithm iterates through all interior edges without finding any illegal ones, the triangulation is locally Delaunay everywhere. By the equivalence theorem, it is globally a Delaunay triangulation, and we return `True`.\n\nThis algorithm performs a constant number of operations (lookups, determinant calculations) for each of the $O(n)$ edges in the triangulation. The total time complexity is dominated by the initial adjacency mapping and the subsequent edge iteration, both of which are $O(n)$.",
