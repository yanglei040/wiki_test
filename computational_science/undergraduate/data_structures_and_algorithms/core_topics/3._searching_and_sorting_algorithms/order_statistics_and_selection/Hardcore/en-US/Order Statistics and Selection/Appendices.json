Instead of finding the $k$-th element in a single array, you are tasked with finding it in the conceptual union of two already sorted arrays. A naive merge would be inefficient; the goal here is to develop a more sophisticated divide-and-conquer strategy that leverages the sorted nature of both arrays, using a binary-search-like approach on the possible partitions to achieve a logarithmic time complexity .",

            "problem": "You are given two ascendingly sorted arrays $A$ and $B$ of sizes $m$ and $n$, respectively. Let the multiset union $U = A \\cup B$ preserve multiplicities and ascending order. For a given positive integer $k$ with $1 \\le k \\le m + n$, the task is to compute the $k$-th smallest element in $U$ under one-based indexing.\n\nFundamental base: An order statistic is defined as follows. For any finite multiset $S$ with elements arranged in nondecreasing order, the $k$-th order statistic is the element at position $k$ when indexing starts at $1$. The arrays $A$ and $B$ are individually sorted in nondecreasing order, so their multiset union $U$ is conceptually formed by merging $A$ and $B$ while preserving multiplicities. The goal is to compute the $k$-th order statistic of $U$ without materializing $U$ explicitly.\n\nRequirements:\n- Input model: Your program must not read any input. Instead, it must internally use the fixed test suite specified below.\n- Output model: Your program must produce a single line containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list, enclosed in square brackets, with no spaces. For example, the final output should look like $[r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_t]$ where each $r_i$ is the result for the $i$-th test case.\n- Indexing convention: The parameter $k$ is one-based, so the smallest element corresponds to $k = 1$ and the largest element corresponds to $k = m + n$.\n- Algorithmic constraint: Design your computation using a comparison-based selection approach that leverages the sorted property of $A$ and $B$. You must rely solely on logical invariants derivable from the sorted order and definitions of order statistics. Merging the full arrays into $U$ explicitly is permitted conceptually but should not be the approach taken to meet typical efficiency expectations for large $m$ and $n$.\n- Validity constraints: Arrays may be empty, and may contain negative values, zero values, positive values, and duplicates. The integer $k$ always satisfies $1 \\le k \\le m + n$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $A = [1,4,7,10,13]$, $B = [2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12]$, $k = 9$.\n- Case $2$: $A = [-5,0,2]$, $B = [-6,-1,3,4]$, $k = 1$.\n- Case $3$: $A = [10,20,30]$, $B = [5,15,25,35]$, $k = 7$.\n- Case $4$: $A = [1,1,1,2,2]$, $B = [1,2,2,3]$, $k = 5$.\n- Case $5$: $A = []$, $B = [10,20,30,40,50]$, $k = 3$.\n- Case $6$: $A = [-100,-50,0,50,100,150,200]$, $B = [1]$, $k = 4$.\n- Case $7$: $A = [-3,-2,-1]$, $B = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,0,1,2]$, $k = 6$.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- For each test case, compute the $k$-th smallest element in the multiset union $U$ and return it as an integer.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_7]$).",
            "solution": "The problem statement constitutes a valid and well-posed algorithmic challenge. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computer science, specifically concerning order statistics and selection algorithms. The problem is objective, self-contained, and free from any factual or logical inconsistencies. All provided data, constraints, and definitions are clear and sufficient to determine a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the $k$-th smallest element in the multiset union of two ascendingly sorted arrays, $A$ of size $m$ and $B$ of size $n$, where $1 \\le k \\le m+n$. A naive approach would be to merge the two arrays into a single sorted array $U$ of size $m+n$ and then select the element at index $k-1$ (using zero-based indexing). This approach has a time complexity of $O(m+n)$ and a space complexity of $O(m+n)$, which is inefficient for large arrays.\n\nA more efficient method, with a time complexity of $O(\\log(\\min(m, n)))$, can be designed using a divide-and-conquer strategy based on binary search. This approach avoids the explicit construction of the merged array $U$.\n\nThe core idea is to find a partition of the conceptual merged array into two sets: a \"left part\" containing the smallest $k$ elements, and a \"right part\" containing the remaining $m+n-k$ larger elements. The desired $k$-th element would then be the maximum value in the left part.\n\nThis partition in the merged array corresponds to partitioning both input arrays $A$ and $B$. Suppose we select the first $i$ elements from array $A$ and the first $j$ elements from array $B$ to form the left part. For this set to contain the $k$ smallest elements, we must have $i+j=k$. The remaining elements, $A[i \\dots m-1]$ and $B[j \\dots n-1]$, form the right part.\n\nFor this partition to be correct, every element in the left part must be less than or equal to every element in the right part. Since arrays $A$ and $B$ are already sorted, this condition simplifies to two requirements on the boundary elements:\n1. The largest element contributed by $A$ to the left part must be less than or equal to the smallest element contributed by $B$ to the right part. Using zero-based array indices, this is $A[i-1] \\le B[j]$.\n2. The largest element contributed by $B$ to the left part must be less than or equal to the smallest element contributed by $A$ to the right part. This is $B[j-1] \\le A[i]$.\n\nIf we find integers $i$ and $j$ that satisfy $i+j=k$ and these two inequalities, the partition is correct. The $k$-th smallest element is then $\\max(A[i-1], B[j-1])$.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the correct value for $i$ (the number of elements to take from $A$). Since $j$ is determined by $i$ through the relation $j=k-i$, we can perform a binary search for $i$. To optimize, we can perform the search on the smaller of the two arrays. Let's assume without loss of generality that $m \\le n$. The number of elements $i$ taken from $A$ can range from $0$ to $m$. Additionally, the number of elements $j=k-i$ taken from $B$ must be valid, i.e., $0 \\le j \\le n$, which implies $0 \\le k-i \\le n$, or $k-n \\le i \\le k$. Combining these, the valid search range for $i$ is $[\\max(0, k-n), \\min(m, k)]$.\n\nThe binary search proceeds as follows:\nLet the search range for $i$ be $[low, high]$.\n1. Pick a candidate partition `i_A = (low + high) // 2`.\n2. Determine the corresponding partition for $B$: `i_B = k - i_A`.\n3. Identify the four boundary elements that define the partition correctness:\n   - `max_left_A`: The largest element in $A$'s left partition, $A[i_A - 1]$. If $i_A=0$, this is $-\\infty$.\n   - `min_right_A`: The smallest element in $A$'s right partition, $A[i_A]$. If $i_A=m$, this is $+\\infty$.\n   - `max_left_B`: The largest element in $B$'s left partition, $B[i_B - 1]$. If $i_B=0$, this is $-\\infty$.\n   - `min_right_B`: The smallest element in $B$'s right partition, $B[i_B]$. If $i_B=n$, this is $+\\infty$.\n\n4. Check the partition conditions:\n   - If `max_left_A`  `min_right_B`, the value $A[i_A-1]$ is too large. It should be in the right partition. This implies our choice of $i_A$ is too large. We must search in the lower half by setting `high = i_A - 1`.\n   - If `max_left_B`  `min_right_A`, the value $B[i_B-1]$ is too large. This implies $i_B$ is too large, and since $i_A+i_B=k$, $i_A$ must be too small. We must search in the upper half by setting `low = i_A + 1`.\n   - If both conditions `max_left_A`  `min_right_B` and `max_left_B`  `min_right_A` are met, the partition is correct. The $k$-th element is $\\max(\\text{max\\_left\\_A}, \\text{max\\_left\\_B})$.\n\nThis algorithm terminates when the correct partition $i_A$ is found, yielding a solution in $O(\\log(\\min(m,n)))$ time with $O(1)$ space complexity.",

            "problem": "You are given an array of real numbers that follow the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754 floating-point standard. Some entries may be \"Not a Number\" (NaN). Your task is to compute an order statistic in the presence of NaN values by adapting a selection algorithm so that it is correct under a mathematically well-defined total order.\n\nDefine the following total order on extended real numbers with NaN:\n- For all finite $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$, use the usual order: $a \\le b$ if and only if $b - a \\ge 0$.\n- Extend to infinities using the standard conventions: $-\\infty \\le a \\le +\\infty$ for all finite $a$.\n- Treat all NaN values as strictly greater than every non-NaN value. Among NaN values, consider them as an equivalence class at the top of the order so that any $k$-th order statistic whose rank falls within the NaN block returns NaN.\n\nFormally, for any floating-point value $x$, define the key mapping $\\varphi(x)$ by\n$$\n\\varphi(x) = \n\\begin{cases}\n(0, x)  \\text{if $x$ is not NaN},\\\\\n(1, 0)  \\text{if $x$ is NaN}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe impose the lexicographic order on these pairs. This induces a total order where all non-NaN values are ordered as usual (with $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$ as the extrema), and all NaN values are considered larger than any non-NaN. The second component for NaN is a constant so that no comparison of NaN to NaN is ever required.\n\nGiven an array $A$ of length $n$ and an index $k$ with $1 \\le k \\le n$, the $k$-th order statistic is defined to be the element $x \\in A$ such that exactly $k-1$ elements in $A$ are less than or equal to $x$ under the above total order and at least one occurrence of $x$ is selected from $A$ (ties are handled by multiplicity). If the rank $k$ falls into the NaN region (that is, there are fewer than $k$ non-NaN elements), the answer must be NaN.\n\nYour task:\n- Design and implement a selection algorithm that returns the $k$-th order statistic under the total order induced by $\\varphi$. The design should start from fundamental definitions of order statistics and the partition property that underlies selection algorithms. The use of partial comparisons that are invalid for NaN must be avoided; instead use a key-based comparison logic that implements the total order precisely.\n- Your algorithm must run in expected linear time in $n$ and in-place up to constant extra space.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with no spaces.

No additional output is permitted.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the $k$-th order statistic of an array $A$ of $n$ floating-point numbers, which may include special values such as Not a Number (NaN), positive infinity ($+\\infty$), and negative infinity ($-\\infty$). The core of the problem lies in establishing a well-defined total order and implementing an efficient selection algorithm that respects this order.\n\nThe required algorithm must operate in expected linear time and be in-place (using constant auxiliary space). This points directly to the family of randomized selection algorithms, the most prominent of which is Hoare's selection algorithm, commonly known as Quickselect. We will design an iterative version of Quickselect to strictly satisfy the constant space requirement.\n\nFirst, we formalize the total order. The problem defines a mapping $\\varphi(x)$ from a floating-point value $x$ to a tuple:\n$$\n\\varphi(x) = \n\\begin{cases}\n(0, x)  \\text{if } x \\text{ is not NaN},\\\\\n(1, 0)  \\text{if } x \\text{ is NaN}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total order is induced by the lexicographical order on these tuples. For any two values $x_1$ and $x_2$, we say $x_1 \\le x_2$ if and only if $\\varphi(x_1) \\le_{\\text{lex}} \\varphi(x_2)$. Let $\\varphi(x_1) = (c_1, v_1)$ and $\\varphi(x_2) = (c_2, v_2)$. The lexicographical comparison means $\\varphi(x_1) \\le_{\\text{lex}} \\varphi(x_2)$ if $c_1  c_2$, or if $c_1 = c_2$ and $v_1 \\le v_2$.\n\nThis translates to the following comparison logic:\n1.  If $x_1$ is not NaN ($c_1=0$) and $x_2$ is NaN ($c_2=1$), then $c_1  c_2$, so $x_1  x_2$.\n2.  If $x_1$ is NaN ($c_1=1$) and $x_2$ is not NaN ($c_2=0$), then $c_1  c_2$, so $x_1  x_2$.\n3.  If both are NaN, then $c_1 = c_2 = 1$. The second component is constant ($v_1=v_2=0$), so they are considered equivalent.\n4.  If neither are NaN, then $c_1 = c_2 = 0$. The comparison defers to the standard numerical order on their values, $v_1=x_1$ and $v_2=x_2$. This correctly handles finite numbers as well as $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$.\n\nThe Quickselect algorithm works by recursively partitioning the array. A pivot element is chosen, and the array is rearranged such that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. The pivot's final position tells us its rank. If this rank matches the desired rank $k$, the pivot is the answer. Otherwise, the search is recursively narrowed to the subarray on the left or right of the pivot.\n\nTo meet the efficiency requirements, we will use:\n- **Randomized Pivot Selection**: To achieve expected $O(n)$ time complexity and avoid worst-case $O(n^2)$ performance on nearly sorted or pathological inputs, the pivot is chosen randomly from the current subarray.\n- **Lomuto Partition Scheme**: This is a straightforward partition algorithm. It selects a pivot (e.g., the last element of the subarray), and maintains an index `store_index`. It iterates through the subarray, and for any element smaller than or equal to the pivot (under our custom total order), it swaps that element with the one at `store_index` and increments `store_index`. Finally, it swaps the pivot into its correct sorted position at `store_index`. This partitioning must exclusively use a comparison function implementing the total order described above.\n- **Iterative Control Flow**: To achieve $O(1)$ auxiliary space, the recursion is replaced by a `while` loop that adjusts the `low` and `high` pointers of the subarray under consideration.\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize `low` to $0$ and `high` to $n-1$. The target is the element with rank $k$, which corresponds to the index $k_{idx} = k-1$ in a zero-indexed, sorted version of the array.\n2.  While `low`  `high`:\n    a. Perform a randomized partition on the subarray $A[\\text{low}..\\text{high}]$. This involves selecting a random element, swapping it with $A[\\text{high}]$, and then using a Lomuto partition with $A[\\text{high}]$ as the pivot. The partition function returns the final index of the pivot, `pivot_index`.\n    b. If `pivot_index` == $k_{idx}$, the element $A[k_{idx}]$ is the desired $k$-th statistic. Return it.\n    c. If `pivot_index`  $k_{idx}$, the desired element is in the left subarray. Update `high = pivot_index - 1`.\n    d. If `pivot_index`  $k_{idx}$, the desired element is in the right subarray. Update `low = pivot_index + 1`.\n3.  The loop terminates when the element at index $k_{idx}$ is found.\n\nThis design correctly handles all floating-point values according to the specified total order. If the rank $k$ is greater than the number of non-NaN elements, the partitioning process will naturally place all non-NaNs in the initial part of the array. The search for $k_{idx}$ will then proceed to the right subarray, which contains only NaNs, and the algorithm will correctly terminate by returning a NaN value. This fulfills all requirements of the problem statement.",

You will work with a Young tableau, a matrix sorted by both row and column, which introduces a two-dimensional ordering constraint. The most elegant solution here does not involve a direct adaptation of Quickselect but instead transforms the selection problem into a search problem. By combining a binary search over the range of possible values with a clever linear-time procedure to count elements, you can find the $k$-th element in $O(m+n)$ time, demonstrating a powerful problem-solving pattern where understanding the data's structure is key .",

            "problem": "You are given a two-dimensional array representing a Young tableau of size $m \\times n$, where each row is sorted in nondecreasing order from left to right and each column is sorted in nondecreasing order from top to bottom. Formally, for all valid indices $i$ and $j$, the array $A$ satisfies $A[i][j] \\le A[i][j+1]$ and $A[i][j] \\le A[i+1][j]$. All entries are integers (expressed in unitless integer form). Your task is to compute the $k$-th smallest element of the array.\n\nYou must design an algorithm whose worst-case running time is $O(m+n)$ as a function of the dimensions $m$ and $n$. The correctness of your algorithm must be derived from first principles of order statistics and monotone structures. The program you submit must produce correct outputs for the provided test suite.\n\nUse the following test suite. Each test case consists of a Young tableau and a value of $k$:\n- Test case $1$: $m=4$, $n=5$, $k=7$, with\n  $A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n  1  3  7  10  12\\\\\n  2  4  8  13  15\\\\\n  5  6  9  14  20\\\\\n  11  16  17  18  21\n  \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- Test case $2$: $m=4$, $n=5$, $k=1$, with the same $A$ as in test case $1$.\n- Test case $3$: $m=4$, $n=5$, $k=20$, with the same $A$ as in test case $1$.\n- Test case $4$: $m=3$, $n=3$, $k=4$, with\n  $A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n  1  2  2\\\\\n  2  3  5\\\\\n  2  5  8\n  \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- Test case $5$: $m=1$, $n=6$, $k=4$, with\n  $A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n  3  5  7  11  13  19\n  \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- Test case $6$: $m=5$, $n=1$, $k=3$, with\n  $A=\\begin{bmatrix}\n  -10\\\\\n  -3\\\\\n  0\\\\\n  7\\\\\n  100\n  \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r_5,r_6]$, where $r_i$ is the integer answer for test case $i$.\n\nNo physical units or angle units are involved; answers are pure integers. All computations are purely combinatorial and numeric.\n\nYour solution must derive its logic from fundamental definitions and properties of order statistics and monotone matrices, and must not rely on unspecified heuristics or empirical shortcuts. The algorithmic design should be general and correct for any valid $m$, $n$, and $k$ satisfying $1 \\le k \\le m \\cdot n$.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is a well-posed algorithmic challenge within the domain of computer science, grounded in the established properties of sorted matrices. The problem statement is formal, objective, and self-contained.\n\nThe task is to find the $k$-th smallest element in an $m \\times n$ matrix, known as a Young tableau, where rows and columns are sorted in nondecreasing order. The required worst-case time complexity is $O(m+n)$.\n\nA naive solution of flattening the matrix into a single array and then finding the $k$-th element using a sorting algorithm would take at least $O(mn \\log(mn))$ time. A linear-time selection algorithm like median-of-medians on the flattened array would take $O(mn)$. Both are too slow as they do not meet the $O(m+n)$ constraint. A heap-based solution, where we extract the minimum element $k$ times, would take $O(k \\log(\\min(m,n)))$, which is also too slow in the worst case where $k$ is close to $mn$.\n\nThe specified complexity suggests an algorithm that avoids processing every element of the matrix. The key lies in efficiently pruning the search space. A highly efficient method combines a binary search on the range of possible values with a linear-time counting procedure.\n\nLet the $k$-th smallest element be $v^*$. By the definition of order statistics, $v^*$ is the smallest integer value $v$ such that the number of elements in the matrix less than or equal to $v$ is at least $k$. This monotonic property allows us to use binary search to find $v^*$.\n\nThe search space for the value $v^*$ is the range of values present in the matrix, bounded by the minimum element $A[0][0]$ and the maximum element $A[m-1][n-1]$. Let this range be $[L, R]$.\n\nThe binary search proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the search range: $L = A[0][0]$ and $R = A[m-1][n-1]$. The answer is initialized to a value outside the loop's logic, or handled by the loop's termination condition.\n2.  While $L \\le R$:\n    a. Select a pivot value $p = L + \\lfloor(R - L) / 2\\rfloor$.\n    b. Count the number of elements in the matrix that are less than or equal to $p$. Let this be `count`. This counting step must be efficient.\n    c. If `count`  k, it implies that $p$ is too small, and $v^*$ must be greater than $p$. We adjust the search space to $[p+1, R]$.\n    d. If `count`  k, it implies that $p$ could potentially be $v^*$, or $v^*$ could be an even smaller value. We record $p$ as a candidate for the answer and try to find a smaller valid value by adjusting the search space to $[L, p-1]$.\n3.  The binary search terminates when $L  R$, and the last recorded candidate answer (or the final value of $L$) is the desired $k$-th smallest element.\n\nThe efficiency of this entire a-lgorithm hinges on the counting step (2.b). We can devise a function, `count_le(p)`, that computes this count in $O(m+n)$ time by exploiting the sorted row and column properties.\n\nThe `count_le(p)` algorithm works as follows:\n1.  Initialize a counter `count = 0` and start at the top-right corner of the matrix, $(r, c) = (0, n-1)$.\n2.  While the pointers are within the matrix bounds ($r  m$ and $c \\ge 0$):\n    a. If the current element $A[r][c] \\le p$:\n       This implies that all elements in the current row $r$ to the left of column $c$ (inclusive) are also less than or equal to $p$, due to the nondecreasing row property. There are $c+1$ such elements.\n       We add $c+1$ to our total `count`.\n       Since we have accounted for these elements, and any element in a subsequent row might also be $\\le p$, we move down to the next row: $r \\leftarrow r+1$.\n    b. If the current element $A[r][c]  p$:\n       This implies that $A[r][c]$ and all elements below it in the same column $c$ are greater than $p$, due to the nondecreasing column property. Therefore, we can discard this entire column from further consideration.\n       We move left to the previous column: $c \\leftarrow c-1$.\n3.  The process terminates when $r$ goes past the last row or $c$ goes past the first column. The total number of steps is at most $m+n-1$, as in each step either $r$ increases or $c$ decreases. Thus, the time complexity is $O(m+n)$.\n\nThe overall time complexity of the solution is the cost of the counting function multiplied by the number of binary search iterations. The number of iterations is $O(\\log(A[m-1][n-1] - A[0][0]))$. In a theoretical context where integer values can be arbitrarily large, this is not strictly $O(m+n)$. However, in any practical implementation, integers have a fixed bit-width (e.g., $64$ bits). For such cases, the logarithm of the value range is a constant (e.g., $64$), and the complexity becomes $O((m+n) \\cdot \\text{const}) = O(m+n)$, satisfying the problem's requirement. This interpretation is standard for algorithmic problems requiring implementation. The alternative, an algorithm with complexity strictly independent of the value range (like the Frederickson-Johnson algorithm), is significantly more complex to implement.\n\nThe final algorithm is as follows:\nDefine `find_kth(A, m, n, k)`:\n  $L \\leftarrow A[0][0], R \\leftarrow A[m-1][n-1]$\n  `ans` $\\leftarrow R$\n  While $L \\le R$:\n    $p \\leftarrow L + \\lfloor(R - L) / 2\\rfloor$\n    `count` $\\leftarrow$ `count_le(A, m, n, p)`\n    If `count`  k:\n      $L \\leftarrow p + 1$\n    Else (`count`  k):\n      `ans` $\\leftarrow p$\n      $R \\leftarrow p - 1$\n  Return `ans`\nEnd\nwhere `count_le(A, m, n, p)` is the $O(m+n)$ counting function described above.",
