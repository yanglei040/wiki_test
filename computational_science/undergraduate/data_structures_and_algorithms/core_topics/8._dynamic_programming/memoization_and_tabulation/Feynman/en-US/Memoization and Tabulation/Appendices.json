This exercise provides a clear, hands-on example of this process by asking you to count the number of ways to tile a simple grid.

            "problem": "You are given a rectangular board of size $2 \\times N$, where $N$ is a positive integer. You have an unlimited supply of tiles of two types: dominoes of size $2 \\times 1$ (which exactly span one full column and may not be rotated) and squares of size $2 \\times 2$. A tiling is a placement of tiles that exactly covers the board without overlaps or gaps.\n\nLet $T(n)$ denote the number of distinct tilings of a $2 \\times n$ board using these tiles. Using only the core definition of dynamic programming (DP), namely that a problem exhibits overlapping subproblems and a decomposable substructure that allows a recurrence derived from a complete case split on the first decision, do the following:\n\n- Derive, from first principles of combinatorial decomposition, a correct recurrence for $T(n)$ together with all necessary base cases.\n- Justify why the resulting recurrence exhibits overlapping subproblems suitable for a tabulation (bottom-up) approach, and specify a tabulation schema that computes $T(n)$ iteratively.\n- State the time and space complexities of your tabulation.\n- Finally, apply your tabulation to compute $T(50)$.

Any valid tiling must cover this column entirely. There are exactly two mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ways to cover the initial portion including this column:\n  1. Place one $2 \\times 1$ domino in the first column. This consumes exactly the first column and leaves a residual board of size $2 \\times (n-1)$, which can be tiled in $T(n-1)$ ways.\n  2.

Computing $T(n)$ for many values of $n$ reuses $T(k)$ for the same $k$ multiple times, hence the subproblems overlap.\n- A bottom-up tabulation fills an array from smaller to larger $n$ to avoid recomputation.

If only the final value is needed, we can store just the previous two values and achieve $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ space.\n\nClosed-form (optional derivation for validation):\n- The linear homogeneous recurrence with constant coefficients\n$$\nT(n) \\;=\\; T(n-1) + T(n-2), \\quad T(0)=1,\\; T(1)=1\n$$\nhas characteristic equation $r^{2} = r + 1$ with roots\n$$\n\\varphi \\;=\\; \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\qquad \\psi \\;=\\; \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n$$\nThe general solution is $T(n) = \\alpha \\varphi^{n} + \\beta \\psi^{n}$.

The final algorithm must be designed using a bottom-up tabulation approach and must use only $\\mathcal{O}(C)$ additional space, where $C$ denotes the target amount in the test case. Your program must not rely on any interactive input and must run deterministically on the predefined test suite.\n\nFundamental base for derivation:\n- Optimal substructure: Any optimal solution to the target amount can be decomposed into an optimal solution to a smaller sub-amount and one additional coin.\n- Overlapping subproblems: The minimal coin counts for sub-amounts recur across different decomposition paths.\n\nDefinitions and constraints:\n- Let the coins be a list of positive integers $\\{d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n\\}$ with $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n- Let the target amount be $C \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$.\n- The output for each test case must be an integer: the minimal number of coins, or $-1$ if no exact sum equals $C$.\n- The tabulation must compute values for all intermediate amounts from $0$ up to $C$ using only an array of length $C+1$ or asymptotically equivalent space.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: Coins $[1, 2, 5]$, Target $11$.\n- Case $2$: Coins $[2, 4]$, Target $7$.\n- Case $3$: Coins $[3, 7, 10]$, Target $14$.\n- Case $4$: Coins $[9, 6, 5, 1]$, Target $11$.\n- Case $5$: Coins $[5, 7]$, Target $5$.\n- Case $6$: Coins $[7, 9]$, Target $0$.\n\nRequired output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $\\text{[result1,result2,result3]}$), where each $\\text{result}$ is the integer answer corresponding to the minimal number of coins for the respective test case (or $-1$ if impossible).",
            "solution": "The Coin Change problem is a classic optimization problem perfectly suited for a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins to make a target amount $C$, which is built upon finding the optimal solutions for all smaller amounts from $0$ to $C-1$.\n\n### Algorithm Design (Tabulation)\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum number of coins required to make an amount `i`. Our goal is to compute `dp[C]`.\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Create a table (an array) `dp` of size `C+1`.\n    *   The base case is `dp[0] = 0`, as it takes zero coins to make an amount of 0.\n    *   Initialize all other entries `dp[i]` for $i > 0$ to a value representing infinity (e.g., `C+1`), signifying that we have not yet found a way to make that amount.\n\n2.  **Iteration**: We build the solution iteratively. For each amount `i` from 1 to `C`, we try to form it by using each available coin denomination `d`.\n    *   For each amount `i` from $1$ to $C$:\n        *   For each coin `d` in our set of denominations:\n            *   If we can use this coin (i.e., `i >= d`), a possible solution is to take one coin `d` and add it to the optimal solution for the remaining amount, `i - d`. The total number of coins for this choice would be `1 + dp[i - d]`.\n            *   We update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and this new possibility: `dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - d])`.\n\n3.  **Result**: After the loops complete, `dp[C]` will hold the minimum number of coins. If `dp[C]` is still our \"infinity\" value, it means the target amount $C$ cannot be formed, and the answer is $-1$.\n\nThis algorithm runs in $\\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot C)$ time, where $n$ is the number of coin denominations, and uses $\\mathcal{O}(C)$ space for the `dp` table, satisfying the problem's constraints.\n\n### Test Case Execution\n\nLet's trace **Case 1**: Coins `[1, 2, 5]`, Target `11`.\n- `dp` array of size 12, initialized with `dp[0] = 0` and others to `12` (infinity).\n- `dp[1] = 1 + dp[0] = 1` (using coin 1)\n- `dp[2] = min(1 + dp[1], 1 + dp[0]) = 1` (using coin 2)\n- `dp[3] = min(1 + dp[2], 1 + dp[1]) = 2`\n- ...\n- `dp[5] = min(1 + dp[4], 1 + dp[3], 1 + dp[0]) = 1` (using coin 5)\n- ...and so on, until `dp[11]` is calculated. For `dp[11]`, the algorithm will find that the minimum is achieved by `1 + dp[6]` (using coin 5, where `dp[6]` is 2) or `1 + dp[10]` (using coin 1, where `dp[10]` is 2), yielding 3. So `dp[11]=3`.\n\nApplying this logic to all test cases yields the following results:\n- **Case 1** (Coins `[1, 2, 5]`, Target `11`): `3` (e.g., 5+5+1)\n- **Case 2** (Coins `[2, 4]`, Target `7`): `-1` (impossible to make an odd sum with even coins)\n- **Case 3** (Coins `[3, 7, 10]`, Target `14`): `2` (7+7)\n- **Case 4** (Coins `[9, 6, 5, 1]`, Target `11`): `2` (6+5)\n- **Case 5** (Coins `[5, 7]`, Target `5`): `1` (5)\n- **Case 6** (Coins `[7, 9]`, Target `0`): `0` (base case)\n\nThe final, correctly formatted output is `[3,-1,2,2,1,0]`.",

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. Your solution must be iterative (no recursion), must leverage overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, and must strictly use $O(N)$ additional memory beyond the input and output.\n\nStart from first principles appropriate for dynamic programming:\n- Formal definitions of subsequence and palindrome,\n- The principle of optimality (Bellman’s principle) for subproblem decomposition,\n- Recognition of overlapping subproblems,\nand derive a correct tabulation strategy that achieves the stated space bound. You must not construct an $O(N^2)$ table in memory, and you must not store the set of decisions for reconstruction; only the LPS length is required.\n\nYour program should compute, for each test string, the integer length of its Longest Palindromic Subsequence.

            "solution": "The Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) problem can be solved with a standard $O(N^2)$ time and space dynamic programming approach. However, by analyzing the data dependencies, we can optimize the space complexity to $O(N)$, as required by the problem.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nLet $S$ be the input string of length $N$. Let $L(i, j)$ denote the length of the LPS of the substring $S[i \\dots j]$.\n- **Optimal Substructure**: The LPS of $S[i \\dots j]$ depends on the characters $S[i]$ and $S[j]$.\n  - If $S[i] == S[j]$, then $L(i, j) = 2 + L(i+1, j-1)$. The two matching characters extend the LPS of the inner substring.\n  - If $S[i] \\neq S[j]$, then the LPS cannot use both endpoints. It must be the LPS of either $S[i+1 \\dots j]$ or $S[i \\dots j-1]$. Thus, $L(i, j) = \\max(L(i+1, j), L(i, j-1))$.\n- **Base Cases**: $L(i, i) = 1$ (a single character is a palindrome of length 1). $L(i, j) = 0$ if $i > j$.\n\n### Space Optimization to $O(N)$\n\nA standard tabulation would use a 2D table `dp[i][j]` to store $L(i, j)$, iterating on substring length. Notice that to compute any value in row `i` of this table, we only need values from row `i` (specifically, `dp[i][j-1]`) and row `i+1` (specifically, `dp[i+1][j]` and `dp[i+1][j-1]`). We never need rows older than `i+1`.\n\nThis dependency allows us to use only two rows of the table at any time. We can optimize this further to use a single 1D array `dp` of size $N$. The algorithm iterates `i` from $N-1$ down to $0$. At the start of each iteration `i`, the `dp` array contains the values for row `i+1` from the conceptual 2D table. We then update `dp` in place to hold the values for row `i`.\n\nThe challenge is that when computing `dp[j]` (representing $L(i, j)$), we need values that are being overwritten.\n- `L(i, j-1)` is the new `dp[j-1]`, which is available.\n- `L(i+1, j)` is the old `dp[j]`, which we are about to overwrite.\n- `L(i+1, j-1)` is the old `dp[j-1]`, which was overwritten in the previous step of the inner loop.\n\nTo solve this, as we iterate `j` from $i+1$ to $N-1$, we must save the necessary \"old\" values before they are overwritten. Specifically, to compute $L(i,j)$, we need $L(i+1, j-1)$. This value was available at step `j-1` as the \"old\" `dp[j-1]`. We can carry this value forward in a temporary variable.\n\n**The $O(N)$ Space Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize a 1D array `dp` of size $N$.\n2.  Iterate `i` from $N-1$ down to $0$.\n3.  For each `i`:\n    a. Set `dp[i] = 1`. This is the base case $L(i, i)$.\n    b. Initialize `prev_val = 0`. This will track the value of $L(i+1, j-1)$ for the current `j`.\n    c. Iterate `j` from $i+1$ to $N-1$:\n        i. Store `dp[j]` in a `temp` variable. This `temp` value is $L(i+1, j)$.\n        ii. If `s[i] == s[j]`, the new value for `dp[j]` is $2 + L(i+1, j-1)$. This is `2 + prev_val`.\n        iii. If `s[i] != s[j]`, the new value for `dp[j]` is $\\max(L(i+1, j), L(i, j-1))$. This is `max(temp, dp[j-1])`. Note that `dp[j-1]` already holds the new value for the current row `i`.\n        iv. Update `prev_val = temp` so it's ready for the next inner loop step, `j+1`.\n\nAfter the loops complete, `dp[N-1]` will hold the final answer, $L(0, N-1)$.\n\n### Test Case Results\n\nApplying this algorithm to the test suite yields:\n- `\"\"`: $0$\n- `\"a\"`: $1$\n- `\"abcde\"`: $1$ (any single character)\n- `\"aaaaa\"`: $5$ (the whole string)\n- `\"bbbab\"`: $4$ (the subsequence \"bbbb\")\n- `\"cbbd\"`: $2$ (the subsequence \"bb\")\n- `\"character\"`: $3$ (e.g., \"crc\", \"cac\", or \"rar\" are valid subsequences)\n- `\"agbdba\"`: $5$ (the subsequence \"abdba\")\n\nThe final, correctly formatted output is `[0,1,1,5,4,2,3,5]`.",
