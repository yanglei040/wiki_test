The transformation must preserve the original tree shape; only the values stored at nodes may be swapped.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- A binary tree is a node-labeled, rooted tree in which each node has up to two children, called the left and right child.\n- A Binary Search Tree (BST) over pairwise distinct integers satisfies the property that for every node with key $k$, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than $k$, and all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than $k$.\n- An in-order traversal of a BST yields a strictly increasing sequence of keys.\n- Swapping the values of exactly two nodes in the tree corresponds exactly to swapping the values at two positions in the in-order traversal sequence produced from that tree shape.\n\nAssumptions:\n- All node values are pairwise distinct integers.\n- The trees are represented in level-order (breadth-first order) as arrays. The root is at index $0$. For any node stored at index $i$, its left child is at index $2i+1$ and its right child is at index $2i+2$. If a child does not exist, its corresponding array entry is the token `None`. No node appears as a child if its parent is `None`.\n\nYour task:\n- For each provided test case, determine a boolean value: `true` if the tree can be made into a BST by at most $1$ swap of two node values (or if it is already a BST), and `false` otherwise.\n- Your program must not read input. It should use the test suite embedded below and produce the required output format precisely.\n\nTest suite (each case is a level-order array with `None` denoting a missing child; numbers are integers):\n- `[]`.\n- `[5]`.\n- `[2,1,3]`.\n- `[3,1,4, None, None, 2]`.\n- `[3,2,1]`.\n- `[10,5,15,1,12]`.\n- `[2,1,4,3]`.\n- `[2, None, 3]`.\n- `[2,3,4,1]`.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- For each test case, output a boolean: `true` or `false`.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For example, if there are three cases, a valid output is `[true,false,true]`. Use lowercase literals \"true\" and \"false\" for booleans.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine if a given binary tree can be transformed into a Binary Search Tree (BST) by performing at most one swap of values between two nodes. The core of the solution rests on a fundamental property of BSTs and their relationship with in-order traversals.\n\nA key principle, provided in the problem statement, is that an in-order traversal of a valid BST yields a sequence of node values that is strictly increasing. Furthermore, swapping the values of two nodes in the tree directly corresponds to swapping the positions of those two values in the sequence generated by an in-order traversal of that tree's structure. This insight allows us to reframe the problem from one of tree manipulation to one of sequence analysis.\n\nLet the given binary tree, represented by a level-order array, be denoted by $T$. The sequence of node values obtained from an in-order traversal of $T$ is denoted by $S_{\\text{inorder}}$. Since all node values are stated to be pairwise distinct integers, a correctly formed BST on these same values would have an in-order traversal sequence that is simply the sorted version of these values. Let this target sequence be denoted by $S_{\\text{sorted}}$, which is obtained by sorting the elements of $S_{\\text{inorder}}$ in strictly ascending order.\n\nThe problem is now equivalent to answering the question: can the sequence $S_{\\text{inorder}}$ be transformed into the sequence $S_{\\text{sorted}}$ by performing at most one swap of two elements?\n\nTo answer this, we compare $S_{\\text{inorder}}$ and $S_{\\text{sorted}}$ element by element and count the number of positions at which they differ. Let this count of mismatches be denoted by $d$.\n\nWe analyze the possible values of $d$:\n\n1.  Case $d=0$: If there are zero mismatches, $S_{\\text{inorder}}$ is identical to $S_{\\text{sorted}}$. This means the sequence is already sorted, and thus the original tree $T$ is already a valid BST. This requires $0$ swaps, which satisfies the condition of \"at most one swap\". The result is `true`.\n\n2.  Case $d=2$: If there are exactly two mismatches, it implies that two elements are out of their sorted positions. For example, suppose $S_{\\text{inorder}}[i] \\neq S_{\\text{sorted}}[i]$ and $S_{\\text{inorder}}[j] \\neq S_{\\text{sorted}}[j]$ for $i \\neq j$, and all other elements are in their correct positions. Since all values are unique and both sequences contain the same set of values, it must be that $S_{\\text{inorder}}[i] = S_{\\text{sorted}}[j]$ and $S_{\\text{inorder}}[j] = S_{\\text{sorted}}[i]$. A single swap of the elements at positions $i$ and $j$ in $S_{\\text{inorder}}$ will correct both positions simultaneously, making the sequence sorted. This corresponds to exactly one swap of node values in the tree $T$. This satisfies the condition of \"at most one swap\". The result is `true`.\n\n3.  Case $d>2$: If there are more than two mismatches, the elements are displaced in a way that cannot be resolved with a single swap. For example, a cyclic permutation of three elements, such as $S_{\\text{inorder}} = [\\dots, c, \\dots, a, \\dots, b, \\dots]$ where $S_{\\text{sorted}} = [\\dots, a, \\dots, b, \\dots, c, \\dots]$, requires at least two swaps to sort. Therefore, if $d > 2$, the condition is not met. The result is `false`.\n\n4.  Case $d=1$: This case is impossible. If a single element at position $i$ is a mismatch, meaning $S_{\\text{inorder}}[i] = v_1$ while $S_{\\text{sorted}}[i] = v_2$ (with $v_1 \\neq v_2$), then the value $v_2$ must appear somewhere else in $S_{\\text{inorder}}$, say at position $j$, where $S_{\\text{inorder}}[j] = v_2$. Since all values are unique, $j \\neq i$. The value at $S_{\\text{sorted}}[j]$ cannot be $v_2$, so the element at position $j$ is also a mismatch. Thus, mismatches must occur in pairs or larger groups, and $d$ can never be $1$.\n\nTherefore, the tree can be made a BST with at most one swap if and only if the number of mismatches $d$ is either $0$ or $2$. The algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  For the given tree represented as a level-order array, construct the in-order traversal sequence, $S_{\\text{inorder}}$. This can be achieved with a recursive function that, for a node at index $i$, first processes its left child (at index $2i+1$), then records the value at index $i$, and finally processes its right child (at index $2i+2$). The recursion terminates for indices that are out of bounds or correspond to a `None` value.\n2.  Create a sorted version of this sequence, $S_{\\text{sorted}}$.\n3.  Calculate the number of mismatches, $d$, by comparing $S_{\\text{inorder}}$ and $S_{\\text{sorted}}$.\n4.  If $d \\le 2$, the condition is met, and the result is `true`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.",

            "solution": "### Algorithmic Solution\nThe problem requires constructing a Binary Search Tree (BST) of minimal height from a given sequence of keys, which is already sorted. The fact that the input sequence $A$ is sorted implies that it is the unique inorder traversal for any BST built from these keys.\n\n**Principle of Construction**\n\nThe fundamental property of an inorder traversal is that it visits all nodes in the left subtree, then the root, then all nodes in the right subtree. To construct a BST from its inorder traversal $A$, if we select an element $A[i]$ as the root, all elements in the prefix $A[0 \\dots i-1]$ must form the left subtree, and all elements in the suffix $A[i+1 \\dots n-1]$ must form the right subtree.\n\nTo achieve a tree of minimum height, the number of nodes in the left and right subtrees must be as balanced as possible at every level of recursion. For a sorted array segment $A[\\text{start} \\dots \\text{end}]$, the optimal choice for the root is the median element, $A[\\text{mid}]$, where $\\text{mid}$ is the middle index of the segment. This choice partitions the remaining elements into two sub-arrays of sizes $\\lfloor (N-1)/2 \\rfloor$ and $\\lceil (N-1)/2 \\rceil$, where $N$ is the number of elements in the segment. This strategy guarantees the construction of a height-balanced tree, thus achieving the minimum possible height.\n\n**Algorithm Design**\n\nA recursive algorithm based on this principle can be designed. Let's define a function `build(A, start, end)` that constructs a minimal-height BST from the sub-array $A[\\text{start} \\dots \\text{end}]$.\n\n1.  **Base Case**: If `start  end`, the array segment is empty, so we return `None` to represent an empty subtree.\n2.  **Recursive Step**:\n    a. Calculate the middle index: `mid = start + (end - start) // 2`.\n    b. Create a new tree node with the key $A[\\text{mid}]$. This node is the root of the current subtree.\n    c. Recursively build the left subtree by calling `build(A, start, mid - 1)`. The result is assigned as the left child of the root.\n    d. Recursively build the right subtree by calling `build(A, mid + 1, end)`. The result is assigned as the right child of the root.\n    e. Return the newly created root node.\n\nThe initial call to construct the entire tree from sequence $A$ of length $n$ would be `build(A, 0, n - 1)`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n-   **Time Complexity**: The `build` function is called exactly once for each element in the input array $A$. The work done within each call (calculating `mid`, creating a node) is constant, i.e., $O(1)$. Therefore, the total time complexity is linear in the number of elements, $O(n)$. It is crucial that sub-arrays are not passed by value (slicing), as this would degrade performance to $O(n \\log n)$. Passing indices achieves the required $O(n)$ complexity.\n-   **Space Complexity**: The algorithm requires space to store the constructed tree, which has $n$ nodes, contributing $O(n)$ space. The recursion stack depth is equal to the height of the tree. Since the tree is balanced, its height is $O(\\log n)$. Thus, the total space complexity is dominated by the storage of the tree itself, which is $O(n)$. Both complexity metrics satisfy the problem's constraints.\n\n**Verification Procedures**\n\nAfter constructing the tree for each sequence $A$, the following four properties must be verified:\n\n1.  **Height, $h(A)$**: The height of a tree rooted at `node` is computed recursively:\n    -   If `node` is `None`, height is $-1$.\n    -   Otherwise, height is $1 + \\max(\\text{height}(\\text{node.left}), \\text{height}(\\text{node.right}))$.\n\n2.  **BST Property, $b_{\\mathrm{bst}}(A)$**: A recursive function `is_bst(node, min_bound, max_bound)` can validate this property. For each `node`, it checks if `min_bound  node.key  max_bound`. The check then recurses on the left child with updated bounds `(min_bound, node.key)` and on the right child with bounds `(node.key, max_bound)`. The initial call for the root would be `is_bst(root, -infinity, +infinity)`. By virtue of the construction algorithm, this will always be `True`.\n\n3.  **Inorder Traversal, $b_{\\mathrm{in}}(A)$**: An inorder traversal is performed on the constructed tree, collecting the keys into a new sequence $A'$. This is done by recursively visiting the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree. Finally, $A'$ is compared element-by-element with the original input $A$. They must be identical, so this check will also always yield `True`.\n\n4.  **Minimal Height, $b_{\\min}(A)$**: The computed height $h(A)$ is compared to the theoretical minimum height $h^\\star(n)$. For $n \\ge 1$, this is $h^\\star(n) = \\lceil \\log_2(n+1) \\rceil - 1$. An efficient, equivalent computation in Python for $n \\ge 1$ is `n.bit_length() - 1`. The construction algorithm is guaranteed to produce a tree of this minimal height, so this check will also always result in `True`. For $n=0$, $h(A)=-1$ and $h^\\star(0)=-1$, so it is also `True`.",

This advanced problem asks you to find the largest rooted subtree within an arbitrary binary tree that satisfies the BST property. Solving this requires a clever recursive approach that verifies the BST property from the bottom up, passing information about subtree validity, size, and key boundaries to parent nodes, offering a masterclass in solving complex tree problems .",

            "problem": "You are given several finite rooted binary trees where each node stores an integer key. A binary tree is defined recursively as either empty or a node with a left binary tree and a right binary tree. For any node $u$ with key $k(u)$, the subtree rooted at $u$ is the node $u$ together with all of its descendants. A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which, for every node $u$ with key $k(u)$, all keys in the left subtree of $u$ are strictly less than $k(u)$, and all keys in the right subtree of $u$ are strictly greater than $k(u)$. Duplicates are allowed in the input trees, but any subtree containing equal keys on the same side will violate the strict inequalities required by the Binary Search Tree (BST) property.\n\nThe task is to compute, for each provided tree $T$, the integer $S(T)$ defined as the number of nodes in the largest rooted subtree of $T$ that satisfies the Binary Search Tree (BST) property. The largest subtree must be a rooted subtree, meaning it consists of some node and all of its descendants.\n\nFundamental base and constraints:\n- Use the core definitions of binary trees, subtrees, and the Binary Search Tree (BST) property stated above.\n- Use well-tested facts only as starting points, such as that an in-order traversal of a Binary Search Tree (BST) yields a strictly increasing sequence of keys, and that the Binary Search Tree (BST) property can be enforced by maintaining ranges for allowable keys across subtrees.\n- Do not assume or use any specialized shortcut formulas beyond these foundations.\n\nInput representation for the provided trees:\n- Each tree is supplied as a level-order list of values where the $i$-th element corresponds to a node, its left child (if any) is at index $2i+1$, and its right child (if any) is at index $2i+2$.\n- The marker `None` denotes a missing child.\n- An empty list denotes the empty tree.\n\nYou must write a complete, runnable program that constructs the trees below internally (no input is read) and computes $S(T)$ for each. The trees are:\n\n- Test case $1$ (general non-BST with a valid Binary Search Tree (BST) subtree): `[10, 5, 15, 1, 8, None, 7]`.\n- Test case $2$ (entire tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST)): `[5, 3, 8, 2, 4, 6, 9]`.\n- Test case $3$ (contains duplicates that break the Binary Search Tree (BST) property globally): `[5, 1, 5, 0, 2, 5, 6]`.\n- Test case $4$ (Binary Search Tree (BST) with negative keys): `[-3, -5, 2, -6, -4, 0, 3]`.\n- Test case $5$ (empty tree): `[]`.\n- Test case $6$ (sparse non-Binary Search Tree (BST) where a proper right subtree is a Binary Search Tree (BST)): `[5, 2, 4, 1, None, 3, 6]`.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case in the order listed, compute $S(T)$, the size (node count) of the largest rooted subtree that satisfies the Binary Search Tree (BST) property.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets and ordered by test case. For example, the format is `[r_1,r_2,r_3,...,r_m]`, where $r_i$ is the result for test case $i$.\n\nThere are no physical units, angles, or percentages involved in this problem. All answers are integers.",
            "solution": "### Solution Algorithm\nThe problem asks for the size of the largest rooted subtree that is a Binary Search Tree (BST). This implies that for each node in the given tree, we must determine if the subtree rooted at that node is a BST and, if so, what its size is. The final answer is the maximum size found across all nodes.\n\nA post-order traversal is a natural strategy for this task. When visiting a node `n`, we first process its left and right subtrees. The information gathered from the children can then be used to determine the properties of the subtree rooted at `n`.\n\nFor any given node `n` with key $k(n)$, to verify if the subtree rooted at `n` is a BST, we require the following conditions to be met simultaneously:\n1.  The left subtree, rooted at $n_{\\text{left}}$, must itself be a BST.\n2.  The right subtree, rooted at $n_{\\text{right}}$, must itself be a BST.\n3.  The key of the current node, $k(n)$, must be strictly greater than the maximum key in its entire left subtree. Let this maximum be $\\max(T_{n_{\\text{left}}})$. The condition is $\\max(T_{n_{\\text{left}}})  k(n)$.\n4.  The key of the current node, $k(n)$, must be strictly less than the minimum key in its entire right subtree. Let this minimum be $\\min(T_{n_{\\text{right}}})$. The condition is $k(n)  \\min(T_{n_{\\text{right}}})$.\n\nThis suggests that a recursive function processing a node must return a set of properties for the subtree rooted at that node. Specifically, for a subtree rooted at node `n`, we need to know:\n- Whether it is a valid BST.\n- Its size (number of nodes).\n- The minimum key within it.\n- The maximum key within it.\n\nLet us define a recursive function, `get_bst_info(node)`, that traverses the tree and returns a tuple of properties: `(is_bst, size, min_val, max_val)`. We also maintain a global or class-level variable, `max_bst_size`, to keep track of the largest BST size found so far.\n\nThe recursive logic for `get_bst_info` at a given `node` is as follows:\n\n1.  **Base Case**: If `node` is empty (`None`), it represents an empty tree, which is by definition a BST of size $0$. To facilitate the parent's calculations, we must return boundary values for `min_val` and `max_val` that will not violate the BST property. We return a tuple indicating success, a size of 0, a minimum value of $+\\infty$, and a maximum value of $-\\infty$.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step**: If `node` is not empty:\n    a. Recursively call the function on the left and right children:\n       - `(is_bst_left, size_left, min_left, max_left) = get_bst_info(node.left)`\n       - `(is_bst_right, size_right, min_right, max_right) = get_bst_info(node.right)`\n    b. Check if the current subtree rooted at `node` is a BST. This is true if and only if all of the following hold:\n       - `is_bst_left` is `True`.\n       - `is_bst_right` is `True`.\n       - `$max_{\\text{left}}  \\text{node.key}  min_{\\text{right}}$`.\n    c. **If the current subtree is a BST**:\n       - Calculate its size: $size_{\\text{current}} = 1 + size_{\\text{left}} + size_{\\text{right}}$.\n       - Update the overall maximum size found: `max_bst_size = max(max_bst_size, size_current)`.\n       - Determine the minimum and maximum keys for this new, larger BST:\n         - $min_{\\text{current}} = \\min(\\text{node.key}, min_{\\text{left}})$.\n         - $max_{\\text{current}} = \\max(\\text{node.key}, max_{\\text{right}})$.\n       - Return a tuple with the properties of this valid BST to the parent: `(True, size_current, min_current, max_current)`.\n    d. **If the current subtree is not a BST**:\n       - It cannot be part of a larger BST rooted at an ancestor. We must propagate this \"failure\" information upwards.\n       - The largest BSTs may still exist in its left or right subtrees; their sizes would have already been recorded in `max_bst_size` during the recursive calls.\n       - Return a tuple indicating failure, e.g., `(False, 0, -infinity, +infinity)`. These bounds are chosen to ensure that any parent node will also fail its BST check, correctly breaking the chain of BST formation. The size is returned as $0$ because this subtree is not a valid BST.\n\nThe overall algorithm consists of initializing `max_bst_size` to $0$, calling `get_bst_info` on the root of the tree, and then returning the final value of `max_bst_size`. For an empty input tree, the size is correctly determined to be $0$.\n\nBefore applying this logic, the input level-order list must be converted into a tree data structure. This can be accomplished using a queue to manage parent nodes as we iterate through the list of keys.",
