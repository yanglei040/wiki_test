This exercise  challenges you to design a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that recognizes amino acid sequences based on specific criteria—a starting amino acid and the absence of another.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimal number of states for a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that recognizes a given language $L$ over the alphabet $\\Sigma$ of the $20$ standard amino acids.\n\nThe alphabet is given as $\\Sigma = \\{ \\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{G}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{I}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{M}, \\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{P}, \\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{R}, \\mathrm{S}, \\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{V}, \\mathrm{W}, \\mathrm{Y} \\}$. The size of the alphabet is $|\\Sigma| = 20$.\n\nThe language $L$ is a subset of $\\Sigma^*$, the set of all finite strings over $\\Sigma$. A string $w \\in \\Sigma^*$ belongs to $L$ if and only if it satisfies two conditions:\n1. The string must start with the symbol $\\mathrm{M}$.\n2. The string must not contain the symbol $\\mathrm{C}$ anywhere.\n\nTo find the minimum number of states for a DFA recognizing $L$, we utilize the Myhill-Nerode theorem. This theorem establishes a direct correspondence between the states of the minimal DFA for a regular language and the equivalence classes of the indistinguishability relation $R_L$. Two strings $x$ and $y$ from $\\Sigma^*$ are indistinguishable, written $x \\ R_L \\ y$, if for all strings $z \\in \\Sigma^*$, the string $xz$ is in $L$ if and only if $yz$ is in $L$.  The number of states in the minimal DFA is precisely the number of distinct equivalence classes of $R_L$.\n\nWe proceed by identifying these equivalence classes by considering the properties of prefixes of strings in $L$.\n\n1.  **Equivalence Class 1: The initial condition.**\n    This class corresponds to the state of having read no input symbols, represented by the empty string, $\\epsilon$. To determine which other strings belong to this class, we analyze the condition for a string $z$ to be a valid \"continuation.\" For the prefix $\\epsilon$, the string $\\epsilon z = z$ is in $L$ if and only if $z$ itself is in $L$. This means $z$ must start with $\\mathrm{M}$ and contain no $\\mathrm{C}$. Let us denote this equivalence class by $C_0 = [\\epsilon]_{R_L}$. This class will correspond to the start state of our DFA. This state is non-accepting because $\\epsilon \\notin L$.\n\n2.  **Equivalence Class 2: The valid, accepting condition.**\n    This class contains prefixes that represent valid strings in $L$ and can be extended to form other valid strings. Let's consider the simplest string in $L$, which is $x_1 = \\mathrm{M}$. What are its valid continuations? For a string $z \\in \\Sigma^*$, the concatenated string $x_1 z = \\mathrm{M}z$ is in $L$ if and only if $z$ contains no symbol $\\mathrm{C}$. The set of valid continuations for $x_1 = \\mathrm{M}$ is $\\{ z \\in \\Sigma^* \\mid \\mathrm{C} \\notin z \\}$, which is different from the set of valid continuations for $\\epsilon$. For instance, the string $z = \\mathrm{A}$ is a valid continuation for $x_1=\\mathrm{M}$ (making $\\mathrm{MA} \\in L$), but not for $x_0=\\epsilon$ (as $\\mathrm{A} \\notin L$). Thus, $\\epsilon$ and $\\mathrm{M}$ are distinguishable, and $[\\epsilon]_{R_L} \\neq [\\mathrm{M}]_{R_L}$.\n    This new equivalence class, $C_1 = [\\mathrm{M}]_{R_L}$, contains all strings that start with $\\mathrm{M}$ and contain no $\\mathrm{C}$. Any string in this class is, by definition, a member of $L$. Hence, the corresponding state in the DFA must be an accepting state.\n\n3.  **Equivalence Class 3: The invalid, trap condition.**\n    This class comprises all prefixes that can never be completed into a string in $L$, regardless of the suffix. Such a prefix is \"dead.\" A prefix $x$ falls into this class if it violates at least one of the conditions for membership in $L$.\n    a) The prefix does not start with $\\mathrm{M}$. For example, consider $x = \\mathrm{A}$. For any suffix $z \\in \\Sigma^*$, the string $xz = \\mathrm{A}z$ will not begin with $\\mathrm{M}$, so $xz \\notin L$.\n    b) The prefix contains the symbol $\\mathrm{C}$. For example, consider $x = \\mathrm{MC}$. For any suffix $z \\in \\Sigma^*$, the string $xz = \\mathrm{MC}z$ contains $\\mathrm{C}$, so $xz \\notin L$.\n    All such prefixes are equivalent with respect to $R_L$ because for any such prefix $x$, there is no suffix $z$ that can make $xz \\in L$. The set of valid continuations is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n    This class, let us call it $C_2$, is distinct from both $C_0$ and $C_1$.\n    - To distinguish $C_2$ from $C_0$, take $x_2 = \\mathrm{A} \\in C_2$ and $x_0 = \\epsilon \\in C_0$. The suffix $z = \\mathrm{M}$ distinguishes them: $x_0 z = \\mathrm{M} \\in L$, but $x_2 z = \\mathrm{AM} \\notin L$.\n    - To distinguish $C_2$ from $C_1$, take $x_2 = \\mathrm{A} \\in C_2$ and $x_1 = \\mathrm{M} \\in C_1$. The suffix $z = \\epsilon$ distinguishes them: $x_1 z = \\mathrm{M} \\in L$, but $x_2 z = \\mathrm{A} \\notin L$.\n\nWe have identified exactly three distinct equivalence classes:\n- $C_0$: The class containing prefixes that have not yet determined the validity or invalidity of the string (only $\\epsilon$).\n- $C_1$: The class containing prefixes that satisfy the conditions of $L$.\n- $C_2$: The class containing prefixes that have violated the conditions of $L$.\n\nAccording to the Myhill-Nerode theorem, the number of states in the minimal DFA is equal to the number of these equivalence classes. Therefore, the minimal number of states required is $3$.\n\nFor completeness, we can describe the minimal DFA, $(Q, \\Sigma, \\delta, q_0, F)$:\n- Set of states: $Q = \\{q_0, q_1, q_2\\}$, where $q_0$ corresponds to $C_0$, $q_1$ to $C_1$, and $q_2$ to $C_2$.\n- Alphabet: $\\Sigma = \\{ \\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{C}, \\dots, \\mathrm{Y} \\}$.\n- Start state: $q_0$.\n- Set of final states: $F = \\{q_1\\}$.\n- Transition function $\\delta: Q \\times \\Sigma \\to Q$:\n  - $\\delta(q_0, \\mathrm{M}) = q_1$\n  - $\\delta(q_0, \\mathrm{C}) = q_2$\n  - $\\delta(q_0, s) = q_2$ for any $s \\in \\Sigma \\setminus \\{\\mathrm{M}, \\mathrm{C}\\}$\n  - $\\delta(q_1, \\mathrm{C}) = q_2$\n  - $\\delta(q_1, s) = q_1$ for any $s \\in \\Sigma \\setminus \\{\\mathrm{C}\\}$\n  - $\\delta(q_2, s) = q_2$ for any $s \\in \\Sigma$\n\nThis construction demonstrates a DFA with $3$ states. As established by the Myhill-Nerode analysis, no DFA with fewer states can recognize the language $L$. Thus, the minimal number of states is $3$.",

The premise that genetic information is read in triplets (codons) is a fundamental fact of molecular biology, providing a sound scientific context for the formal problem. The problem is a standard exercise in automata theory.\n- **Well-Posed**: The language $L$ is unambiguously defined. The tasks of constructing a minimal DFA and finding a corresponding generating function are well-defined mathematical problems with unique solutions.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is precise, quantitative, and free of any subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed for invalidation. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be furnished.\n\nThe first task is to construct a minimal DFA that recognizes the language $L$. The language $L$ consists of all strings $w$ over the alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{T}\\}$ such that the length of the string, $|w|$, is a multiple of $3$. This can be expressed as $|w| \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n\nThis property suggests a DFA with states that track the length of the input string modulo $3$. We define a DFA $M = (Q, \\Sigma, \\delta, q_0, F)$ with three states:\n- $Q = \\{q_0, q_1, q_2\\}$, where the machine is in state $q_i$ if the length of the string read so far is congruent to $i \\pmod 3$.\n- $\\Sigma = \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{G}, \\mathrm{T}\\}$ is the input alphabet. The size of the alphabet is $|\\Sigma| = 4$.\n- $q_0$ is the start state. This is appropriate because the empty string $\\epsilon$ has length $0$, and $0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n- $F = \\{q_0\\}$ is the set of accepting states, since the language consists of strings whose length is a multiple of $3$.\n- The transition function $\\delta: Q \\times \\Sigma \\to Q$ is defined as follows. For any symbol $s \\in \\Sigma$:\n  - $\\delta(q_0, s) = q_1$, because if a string has length $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, appending one symbol results in a string of length $n+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n  - $\\delta(q_1, s) = q_2$, because if a string has length $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, appending one symbol results in a string of length $n+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n  - $\\delta(q_2, s) = q_0$, because if a string has length $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, appending one symbol results in a string of length $n+1 \\equiv 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n\nTo prove this $3$-state DFA is minimal, we must show that all pairs of states are distinguishable.\n- The pair $(q_0, q_1)$ is distinguishable because $q_0 \\in F$ and $q_1 \\notin F$. Similarly, $(q_0, q_2)$ is distinguishable.\n- To distinguish between $q_1$ and $q_2$, we must find a string $w$ such that one of $\\delta(q_1, w)$ and $\\delta(q_2, w)$ is in $F$ and the other is not. Let's choose a string of length one, for instance $w = \\mathrm{A}$.\n  - From state $q_1$, reading 'A' leads to state $\\delta(q_1, \\mathrm{A}) = q_2$, which is not a final state.\n  - From state $q_2$, reading 'A' leads to state $\\delta(q_2, \\mathrm{A}) = q_0$, which is a final state.\nSince the outcomes are different (one accepting, one not), the states $q_1$ and $q_2$ are distinguishable. As all pairs of states $(q_0, q_1)$, $(q_0, q_2)$, and $(q_1, q_2)$ are distinguishable, the DFA is minimal.\n\nThe second task is to find the ordinary generating function $G(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$, where $a_n$ is the number of strings in $L$ of length $n$.\nA string is in $L$ if and only if its length $n$ is a non-negative multiple of $3$.\nFor a given length $n$, the number of possible strings over the alphabet $\\Sigma$ of size $4$ is $4^n$.\nTherefore, the sequence $a_n$ is described as:\n- If $n$ is a multiple of $3$ (i.e., $n = 3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$), then $a_n = 4^n$.\n- If $n$ is not a multiple of $3$, then $a_n = 0$.\n\nWe can now write the generating function $G(z)$ by substituting this definition of $a_n$:\n$$\nG(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n = a_0 z^0 + a_3 z^3 + a_6 z^6 + \\dots\n$$\nThe terms for $n$ not divisible by $3$ are zero. We are left with terms where $n=3k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\n$$\nG(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{3k} z^{3k}\n$$\nSubstituting $a_{3k} = 4^{3k}$:\n$$\nG(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} 4^{3k} z^{3k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (4^3 z^3)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (64 z^3)^k\n$$\nThis is a standard geometric series of the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k$ with the common ratio $r = 64 z^3$. The sum of such a series is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{1-r}$, provided $|r|  1$.\nThus, the closed-form expression for the generating function is:\n$$\nG(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 64z^3}\n$$\nThis result can be verified using the transfer matrix method on the derived DFA. Let $G_i(z)$ be the generating function for strings that take the machine from the start state $q_0$ to state $q_i$. We have the following system of linear equations, where the term $1$ in the equation for $G_0(z)$ accounts for the empty string:\n\\begin{align*}\nG_0(z) = 1 + 4z G_2(z) \\\\\nG_1(z) = 4z G_0(z) \\\\\nG_2(z) = 4z G_1(z)\n\\end{align*}\nThe language's generating function is $G(z) = G_0(z)$ as $q_0$ is the only accepting state. Substituting the second equation into the third gives $G_2(z) = 4z (4z G_0(z)) = 16z^2 G_0(z)$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\nG_0(z) = 1 + 4z (16z^2 G_0(z)) = 1 + 64z^3 G_0(z)\n$$\nSolving for $G_0(z)$:\n$$\nG_0(z) (1 - 64z^3) = 1 \\implies G_0(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 64z^3}\n$$\nThis confirms the result obtained through direct combinatorial counting.",

For the purposes of modeling, assume characters are drawn independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) as follows: with total probability $p_{U}$ an uppercase letter is emitted and, conditional on being uppercase, each of the $26$ uppercase letters is equally likely; with total probability $p_{L}$ a lowercase letter is emitted and, conditional on being lowercase, each of the $26$ lowercase letters is equally likely; with total probability $p_{D}$ a digit is emitted and, conditional on being a digit, each of the $10$ digits is equally likely; with the remaining probability, any other character is emitted (you do not need its exact distribution).

It contains no contradictions or missing information. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a formal solution will be derived.\n\n**Part 1: Regular Expression Construction**\n\nThe task is to construct a single regular expression that matches any of the four specified gene symbols: `TP53`, `BRCA1`, `EGFR`, and `MSH2`. The matching must be case-insensitive for letters and exact for digits. The construction will be based on the formal operations of union (denoted by `$|$$`) and concatenation (implicit by adjacency).\n\nFor a single alphabetic character, say `$T$`, case-insensitive matching requires it to match either `$T$` or `$t$`. This is expressed as the union `$(T|t)$`. For a digit, say `$5$`, matching is exact, so the expression is simply `$5$`.\n\nWe construct the expression for each gene symbol by concatenating the expressions for its constituent characters:\n- For `TP53`: Two letters followed by two digits. The regular expression is `$(T|t)(P|p)53$`.\n- For `BRCA1`: Four letters followed by one digit. The regular expression is `$(B|b)(R|r)(C|c)(A|a)1$`.\n- For `EGFR`: Four letters. The regular expression is `$(E|e)(G|g)(F|f)(R|r)$`.\n- For `MSH2`: Three letters followed by one digit. The regular expression is `$(M|m)(S|s)(H|h)2$`.\n\nTo match any of these four gene symbols, we take the union of their individual regular expressions. This results in the final composite regular expression:\n```\n((T|t)(P|p)53)|((B|b)(R|r)(C|c)(A|a)1)|((E|e)(G|g)(F|f)(R|r))|((M|m)(S|s)(H|h)2)\n```\nThis expression correctly models the matching criteria as specified.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Expected Number of Mentions**\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of (possibly overlapping) mentions of any of the four gene symbols in a text of length $N$. We are asked to find the expected value of $X$, denoted $E[X]$. We proceed from first principles using indicator variables and the linearity of expectation.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\text{TP53, BRCA1, EGFR, MSH2}\\}$ be the set of gene symbols. For each symbol $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$, let $L_S$ be its length.\n- $L_{\\text{TP53}} = 4$\n- $L_{\\text{BRCA1}} = 5$\n- $L_{\\text{EGFR}} = 4$\n- $L_{\\text{MSH2}} = 4$\n\nFor each symbol $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and each possible starting position $i$ in the text (where $1 \\leq i \\leq N - L_S + 1$), we define an indicator random variable $X_{i,S}$:\n$$ X_{i,S} = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if a mention of symbol } S \\text{ starts at position } i \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThe total count $X$ is the sum of these indicator variables over all symbols and all valid starting positions:\n$$ X = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N - L_S + 1} X_{i,S} $$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of $X$ is:\n$$ E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N - L_S + 1} X_{i,S}\\right] = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N - L_S + 1} E[X_{i,S}] $$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[X_{i,S}] = P(X_{i,S} = 1)$.\nLet $P_S = P(X_{i,S} = 1)$ be the probability that a mention of symbol $S$ starts at an arbitrary position $i$. Since the characters are i.i.d., this probability is independent of the position $i$.\n\nThe next step is to calculate $P_S$ for each $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$. We first determine the probability of matching a single character.\n- The probability of drawing a specific uppercase letter is $\\frac{p_U}{26}$.\n- The probability of drawing a specific lowercase letter is $\\frac{p_L}{26}$.\n- For a case-insensitive match of a letter, say `C`, we require either uppercase `C` or lowercase `c`. The probability of this event is $\\frac{p_U}{26} + \\frac{p_L}{26} = \\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}$. Let us denote this probability by $P_{char}$.\n- The probability of drawing a specific digit is $\\frac{p_D}{10}$. Let us denote this by $P_{digit}$.\n\nUsing the i.i.d. assumption, the probability $P_S$ of matching a gene symbol string is the product of the probabilities of matching each character in the string.\n- For $S = \\text{TP53}$ (2 letters, 2 digits):\n$$ P_{\\text{TP53}} = (P_{char})^2 (P_{digit})^2 = \\left(\\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{p_D}{10}\\right)^2 $$\n- For $S = \\text{BRCA1}$ (4 letters, 1 digit):\n$$ P_{\\text{BRCA1}} = (P_{char})^4 (P_{digit})^1 = \\left(\\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{p_D}{10}\\right) $$\n- For $S = \\text{EGFR}$ (4 letters, 0 digits):\n$$ P_{\\text{EGFR}} = (P_{char})^4 = \\left(\\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}\\right)^4 $$\n- For $S = \\text{MSH2}$ (3 letters, 1 digit):\n$$ P_{\\text{MSH2}} = (P_{char})^3 (P_{digit})^1 = \\left(\\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{p_D}{10}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we can substitute these probabilities back into the expression for $E[X]$.\n$$ E[X] = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N - L_S + 1} P_S = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} (N - L_S + 1) P_S $$\nExpanding this sum for the four gene symbols:\n$$ E[X] = (N - L_{\\text{TP53}} + 1)P_{\\text{TP53}} + (N - L_{\\text{BRCA1}} + 1)P_{\\text{BRCA1}} + (N - L_{\\text{EGFR}} + 1)P_{\\text{EGFR}} + (N - L_{\\text{MSH2}} + 1)P_{\\text{MSH2}} $$\nSubstituting the lengths $L_S$:\n$$ E[X] = (N - 4 + 1)P_{\\text{TP53}} + (N - 5 + 1)P_{\\text{BRCA1}} + (N - 4 + 1)P_{\\text{EGFR}} + (N - 4 + 1)P_{\\text{MSH2}} $$\n$$ E[X] = (N - 3)P_{\\text{TP53}} + (N - 4)P_{\\text{BRCA1}} + (N - 3)P_{\\text{EGFR}} + (N - 3)P_{\\text{MSH2}} $$\nWe can group terms with the same coefficient:\n$$ E[X] = (N - 3)(P_{\\text{TP53}} + P_{\\text{EGFR}} + P_{\\text{MSH2}}) + (N - 4)P_{\\text{BRCA1}} $$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the probabilities to obtain the final closed-form expression for the expected count in terms of $N$, $p_U$, $p_L$, and $p_D$:\n$$ E[X] = (N - 3)\\left[ \\left(\\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{p_D}{10}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}\\right)^4 + \\left(\\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{p_D}{10}\\right) \\right] + (N - 4)\\left(\\frac{p_U + p_L}{26}\\right)^4 \\left(\\frac{p_D}{10}\\right) $$\nThis expression represents the final analytical solution derived from the given principles.",
