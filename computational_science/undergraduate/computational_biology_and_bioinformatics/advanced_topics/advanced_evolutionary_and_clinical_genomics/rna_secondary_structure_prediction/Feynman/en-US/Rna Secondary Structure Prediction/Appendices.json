However, biophysical reality is more nuanced; for instance, the guanine-cytosine (G-C) pair, with its three hydrogen bonds, contributes more to a structure's thermal stability than an adenine-uracil (A-U) pair. This exercise challenges you to adapt the classic dynamic programming approach by modifying the objective function, tasking you with maximizing the count of G-C pairs specifically, a common proxy for structural stability . This is a crucial first step in moving from purely combinatorial models to more biophysically-grounded predictions.",

            "problem": "You are given an idealized model of ribonucleic acid (RNA) secondary structure as a set of base pairs on a single-stranded sequence over the alphabet {A, U, G, C}. A secondary structure on a sequence of length $n$ is a set $M$ of ordered index pairs $(i,j)$ with $0 \\le i  j \\le n-1$ satisfying the following validity constraints: (1) each index appears in at most one pair, (2) only canonical pairs are allowed, where the allowed base pairs are A–U, U–A, G–C, C–G, G–U, and U–G, and (3) there are no pseudoknots, meaning that if $(i,j) \\in M$ and $(k,\\ell) \\in M$, then it is not the case that $i  k  j  \\ell$. Additionally, a minimum hairpin loop length constraint is enforced: for each pair $(i,j) \\in M$, the number of unpaired nucleotides enclosed by the pair must be at least $L$, that is $j - i - 1 \\ge L$, where $L$ is a given nonnegative integer.\n\nDefine the guanine-cytosine content objective as follows.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a constrained optimization problem centered on the prediction of RNA secondary structure, a classic subject in computational biology. The task is to find a valid secondary structure that maximizes the number of Guanine-Cytosine (G-C) pairs. The prohibition of pseudoknots is a critical constraint that renders the problem solvable by dynamic programming, as it ensures that the structure can be decomposed hierarchically.\n\nLet the given RNA sequence be $s$, with length $n$, indexed from $0$ to $n-1$. We define $E(i, j)$ as the maximum possible G-C score for the subsequence $s_i, s_{i+1}, \\dots, s_j$. The objective is to compute $E(0, n-1)$.\n\nThe solution is built upon the principle of optimality: an optimal structure for a sequence is composed of optimal structures for its sub-sequences. We construct a recurrence relation for $E(i, j)$ by considering all valid structural configurations of the subsequence $s_i \\dots s_j$. Any such structure is determined by the status of the base at index $j$.\n\nThere are two fundamental cases for the base $s_j$:\n\n1.  **The base $s_j$ is unpaired.** In this case, $s_j$ does not form a pair and contributes nothing to the G-C score. The problem of optimizing the structure on $s_i \\dots s_j$ reduces to finding the optimal structure for the shorter subsequence $s_i \\dots s_{j-1}$. The score is therefore given by $E(i, j-1)$.\n\n2.  **The base $s_j$ is paired with a base $s_k$, where $i \\le k  j$.** The formation of a pair $(k, j)$ is subject to two primary constraints defined in the problem:\n    -   **Canonical Pairing**: The pair of nucleotides $(s_k, s_j)$ must be one of the allowed canonical pairs: A–U, U–A, G–C, C–G, G–U, or U–G.\n    -   **Minimum Hairpin Loop Length**: The number of nucleotides enclosed by the pair must be at least $L$, which translates to the condition $j - k - 1 \\ge L$.\n\nIf a pair $(k, j)$ satisfies these conditions, its formation has a local and global impact. Locally, it contributes to the total score. The contribution is $1$ if $\\{s_k, s_j\\} = \\{\\text{G}, \\text{C}\\}$, and $0$ for other allowed canonical pairs (A-U, G-U, and their reverse complements). Globally, the no-pseudoknot rule dictates that the pair $(k, j)$ partitions the sequence $s_i \\dots s_j$ into two independent sub-regions that can be optimized separately: the region preceding the pair, $s_i \\dots s_{k-1}$, and the region enclosed by the pair, $s_{k+1} \\dots s_{j-1}$. The total score for this specific configuration is the sum of the optimal scores from these two independent sub-problems plus the score contribution from the pair $(k, j)$ itself.\n\nBy combining these cases and maximizing over all possibilities, we arrive at the following recurrence relation:\n$$\nE(i, j) = \\max \\left( E(i, j-1), \\quad \\max_{ \\substack{i \\le k  j \\\\ (k,j) \\text{ is valid}} } \\left\\{ E(i, k-1) + E(k+1, j-1) + \\mathbf{1}(\\{s_k,s_j\\}=\\{\\mathrm{G},\\mathrm{C}\\}) \\right\\} \\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{1}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function, which evaluates to $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise. The term \"valid\" for the pair $(k,j)$ encompasses both the canonical pairing rule and the minimum loop length constraint.\n\nThe base cases for the recursion are subsequences that are too short to form any valid pairs. For any $i, j$ such that the subsequence length $j-i+1$ is less than $L+2$, it is impossible to form a hairpin loop satisfying the minimum length $L$. Thus, for such subsequences, $E(i, j) = 0$. We also define $E(i, j) = 0$ for any $i  j$, corresponding to an empty subsequence.\n\nThis recurrence is implemented algorithmically by populating a two-dimensional array, let's call it $\\texttt{dp}[i][j]$, which stores the computed values of $E(i, j)$. The computation proceeds by iterating over increasing subsequence lengths $d = j-i$, from $d=1$ up to $d=n-1$. For each length $d$, we iterate through all possible starting positions $i$ from $0$ to $n-1-d$. The final solution to the problem is the value stored in $\\texttt{dp}[0][n-1]$.",

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of base pairs in a pseudoknot-free RNA secondary structure, with the additional constraint against lonely pairs. This class of problem is typically solved using dynamic programming. To align with standard computational practices and the provided code, we will use 0-based indexing for the sequence $s$ of length $n$, meaning indices run from $0$ to $n-1$.\n\nThe pseudoknot-free constraint implies that any structure on a subsequence $s[i \\dots j]$ can be decomposed. The structure is either formed by two independent, adjacent substructures (a bifurcation) or is enclosed by a base pair connecting some $s[k]$ to $s[l]$ where $i \\le k  l \\le j$.\n\nThe critical constraint is the \"no lonely pairs\" rule. This rule states that every base pair must be adjoined by at least one other base pair, forming a stack. The minimal such structure is a \"stacked pair\" or a \"helix of length 2\", for instance, pairs $(i, j)$ and $(i+1, j-1)$. This means that the fundamental unit of scoring is not a single base pair, but a helix of length at least $2$.\n\nWe can formulate a dynamic programming solution based on this insight. Let $M[i, j]$ be the maximum number of base pairs that can be formed within the subsequence $s[i \\dots j]$. To compute $M[i, j]$, we consider all possible valid structures for this subsequence. Due to the pseudoknot-free constraint, any such structure falls into one of two categories:\n\n1.  **Bifurcation**: The structure on $s[i \\dots j]$ consists of two independent and adjacent substructures on $s[i \\dots k]$ and $s[k+1 \\dots j]$ for some split point $k$ where $i \\le k  j$. The total number of pairs in this case is $M[i, k] + M[k+1, j]$. We must maximize over all possible $k$.\n\n2.  **Enclosing Helix**: The entire subsequence $s[i \\dots j]$ is enclosed by a helix. Due to the \"no lonely pairs\" rule, this helix must have a length $p \\ge 2$. A helix of length $p$ consists of $p$ stacked pairs: $(i, j), (i+1, j-1), \\dots, (i+p-1, j-p+1)$. This configuration contributes $p$ pairs, plus the maximum number of pairs that can be formed in the remaining inner subsequence, $s[i+p \\dots j-p]$, which is given by $M[i+p, j-p]$.\n\nTo efficiently determine the possible helix lengths, we can pre-compute a helper table, $H[i, j]$, which stores the length of the longest possible helix starting with the pair $(i, j)$ and extending inwards. This table can be computed recursively:\n$$\nH[i, j] = \\begin{cases} 1 + H[i+1, j-1]  \\text{if } (s[i], s[j]) \\text{ can form a base pair} \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe base cases are $H[i, j] = 0$ if $j \\le i$.\n\nWith the $H$ table pre-computed, the recurrence for $M[i, j]$ combines the two structural possibilities:\n$$\nM[i, j] = \\max \\left( \\max_{i \\le k  j} (M[i, k] + M[k+1, j]), \\quad \\max_{p=2, \\dots, H[i, j]} (p + M[i+p, j-p]) \\right)\n$$\nThe first term corresponds to the bifurcation case. The second term corresponds to the enclosing helix case, where we maximize over all possible valid helix lengths $p \\ge 2$. If no such helix can form (i.e., $H[i, j]  2$), this term is effectively $0$ and does not contribute to the maximum. The base cases for the main recurrence are $M[i, j] = 0$ for all $j \\le i$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by iterating through increasing subsequence lengths $L$ from $1$ to $n$. For each $L$, we compute $H[i, j]$ and $M[i, j]$ for all $i$ where $j=i+L-1$. The final answer is the maximum number of pairs for the entire sequence, given by $M[0, n-1]$. This ensures that when we compute a value for a subsequence of a certain length, the values for all shorter subsequences have already been computed.",

For $n\\in\\{0,1\\}$, define $F_{\\mathrm{circ}}(S,L,W)=0$.\n\nYour task is to compute $F_{\\mathrm{circ}}(S,L,W)$ for each sequence in the following test suite. Each test case is a triple $(\\text{sequence},L,W)$:\n\n- Case $1$: $\\left(\\text{\"GCAUCUAUGC\"},\\,L=1,\\,W=1\\right)$.\n- Case $2$: $\\left(\\text{\"AAAAAAA\"},\\,L=1,\\,W=1\\right)$.\n- Case $3$: $\\left(\\text{\"AU\"},\\,L=1,\\,W=1\\right)$.\n- Case $4$: $\\left(\\text{\"GUGU\"},\\,L=1,\\,W=1\\right)$.\n- Case $5$: $\\left(\\text{\"GCGC\"},\\,L=1,\\,W=0\\right)$.\n- Case $6$: $\\left(\\text{\"\"},\\,L=1,\\,W=1\\right)$.\n- Case $7$: $\\left(\\text{\"AC\"},\\,L=1,\\,W=0\\right)$.\n\nAll answers must be integers. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered by the cases above. For example, a valid output format with three integer results would be [$2$,$0$,$1$]. No additional text should be printed.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem lies in the definition of the circular score, $F_{\\mathrm{circ}}(S,L,W)$, which is formulated as the maximum score over all possible linearizations of the circular sequence:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{circ}}(S,L,W) = \\max_{k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}} F_{\\mathrm{lin}}(\\operatorname{rot}_k(S),L,W)\n$$\nHere, $\\operatorname{rot}_k(S)$ is the linear sequence of length $n$ obtained by cutting the circle before position $k$. The function $F_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ computes the maximum number of pairs on a linear sequence, with the crucial additional constraint that the first and last bases of this linear sequence are forbidden from pairing. This constraint is to prevent counting pairs that would span the artificial cut point.\n\nOur strategy is therefore to develop a two-level algorithm. The outer level iterates through all $n$ possible rotations of the circular sequence. For each rotation, the inner level calculates its $F_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ score.\n\nThe calculation of $F_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ for a linear sequence $S'$ of length $m$ is the most substantial part. The prohibition of a pair between the ends ($S'_0$ and $S'_{m-1}$) implies that any valid structure must be decomposable at a top level; that is, it must be a linear concatenation of one or more independent, non-crossing substructures. The score for such a structure is obtained by finding the optimal \"split point\" $k'$ that partitions the sequence into two independent subproblems, $S'[0 \\dots k']$ and $S'[k'+1 \\dots m-1]$.\n\nThis structure lends itself to dynamic programming. We first compute a table, let us call it $M$, where $M[i,j]$ stores the maximum number of pairs for any valid non-crossing structure on the subsequence $S'[i \\dots j]$. This is a standard Nussinov-type algorithm. The recurrence relation is:\n$$\nM[i,j] = \\max \\begin{cases}\nM[i, j-1]  (\\text{corresponds to base } j \\text{ being unpaired}) \\\\\n\\max_{k=i}^{j-L-1} \\left( (M[i, k-1] \\text{ if } ki \\text{ else } 0) + M[k+1, j-1] + \\delta(k, j, W) \\right)  (\\text{corresponds to base } j \\text{ pairing with base } k)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe term $\\delta(k, j, W)$ is $1$ if bases $S'_k$ and $S'_j$ form a valid pair (canonical or wobble, depending on $W$), and $0$ otherwise. The condition $k \\le j-L-1$ enforces the minimum loop length constraint, as it implies $j-k-1 \\ge L$. The table $M$ is filled for increasing subsequence lengths, $d = j-i$.\n\nOnce the table $M$ is populated, we can compute $F_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S')$ by considering all possible top-level bifurcations:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{lin}}(S') = \\max_{k' \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-2\\}} \\left( M[0, k'] + M[k'+1, m-1] \\right)\n$$\nThis formula correctly captures the score for the best structure that does not pair the ends of $S'$.\n\nThe final algorithm is as follows:\n1. For a given circular sequence $S$, iterate through all $n$ rotations, $\\operatorname{rot}_k(S)$.\n2. For each rotation, compute the full dynamic programming table $M$.\n3. From table $M$, calculate $F_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ using the bifurcation formula.\n4. The maximum $F_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ score found across all rotations is the answer, $F_{\\mathrm{circ}}$.\n\nFor edge cases where sequence length $n$ is $0$ or $1$, the score is defined as $0$. The overall time complexity of this approach is $O(n \\cdot n^3) = O(n^4)$, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints.",
