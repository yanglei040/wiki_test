Each histogram consists of nonnegative integer counts over contiguous fragment-length bins with specified edges measured in base pairs. Assume the following generative model and classification objective.\n\n1. Fragment lengths are modeled as a continuous variable $\\ell$ in base pairs with a class-conditional probability density constructed as a mixture of Gaussian components corresponding to subnucleosomal and nucleosomal fragments.

            "solution": "The problem requires the classification of ATAC-seq samples into one of two classes, Healthy ($\\mathrm{H}$) or Tumor ($\\mathrm{T}$), based on fragment-length histograms. This is a Bayesian classification problem. The objective is to determine, for a given vector of fragment counts $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, \\dots, c_9)$, which class $C \\in \\{\\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{T}\\}$ maximizes the posterior probability $P(C \\mid \\mathbf{c})$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$\nP(C \\mid \\mathbf{c}) = \\frac{P(\\mathbf{c} \\mid C) P(C)}{P(\\mathbf{c})}\n$$\nTo maximize $P(C \\mid \\mathbf{c})$, we need to compare $P(\\mathrm{H} \\mid \\mathbf{c})$ and $P(\\mathrm{T} \\mid \\mathbf{c})$. The term $P(\\mathbf{c})$ is a normalizing constant, identical for both classes, and can be disregarded for the purpose of comparison. The problem states that the class priors are equal, $P(\\mathrm{H}) = P(\\mathrm{T}) = 1/2$. Therefore, maximizing the posterior probability is equivalent to maximizing the class-conditional likelihood, $P(\\mathbf{c} \\mid C)$. The decision rule is to choose class $\\mathrm{H}$ if $P(\\mathbf{c} \\mid \\mathrm{H}) > P(\\mathbf{c} \\mid \\mathrm{T})$, and class $\\mathrm{T}$ otherwise.\n\nThe problem states that the count vector $\\mathbf{c}$, conditioned on the class $C$ and total count $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} c_i$, follows a multinomial distribution with parameters $N$ and a probability vector $\\mathbf{p}_C = (p_{C,1}, \\dots, p_{C,9})$. The likelihood is given by the multinomial probability mass function:\n$$\nP(\\mathbf{c} \\mid C) = \\frac{N!}{c_1! c_2! \\dots c_9!} \\prod_{i=1}^{9} p_{C,i}^{c_i}\n$$\nThe multinomial coefficient $\\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{9} c_i!}$ is also identical for both classes and can be ignored in the comparison. The decision is thus based on comparing the product term $\\prod_{i=1}^{9} p_{C,i}^{c_i}$. To avoid numerical underflow from multiplying many small probabilities, it is computationally more stable to compare the log-likelihoods. The decision rule becomes: choose class $\\mathrm{H}$ if $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathrm{H}) > \\mathcal{L}(\\mathrm{T})$, where the relevant part of the log-likelihood for a class $C$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(C) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{9} p_{C,i}^{c_i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} c_i \\log p_{C,i}\n$$\nThe core of the problem is therefore to compute the bin probability vectors $\\mathbf{p}_\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathbf{p}_\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nThe problem defines these probabilities based on a continuous generative model for fragment length $\\ell$. For each class $C$, the unnormalized density $f_C(\\ell)$ is a mixture of $4$ Gaussian components:\n$$\nf_C(\\ell) = \\sum_{k=1}^{4} w_{C,k} \\cdot \\phi(\\ell \\mid \\mu_k, \\sigma_{C,k})\n$$\nwhere $\\phi(\\ell \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. The bin probability $p_{C,i}$ for the $i$-th bin $[b_i, b_{i+1})$ is obtained by integrating $f_C(\\ell)$ over this interval and normalizing by the sum of integrals over all $9$ specified bins.\n\nFirst, we calculate the unnormalized probability mass for each bin $i$ and class $C$, which we denote by $I_{C,i}$:\n$$\nI_{C,i} = \\int_{b_i}^{b_{i+1}} f_C(\\ell)\\, d\\ell = \\int_{b_i}^{b_{i+1}} \\sum_{k=1}^{4} w_{C,k} \\cdot \\phi(\\ell \\mid \\mu_k, \\sigma_{C,k})\\, d\\ell\n$$\nBy the linearity of integration, this is:\n$$\nI_{C,i} = \\sum_{k=1}^{4} w_{C,k} \\int_{b_i}^{b_{i+1}} \\phi(\\ell \\mid \\mu_k, \\sigma_{C,k})\\, d\\ell\n$$\nThe integral of a Gaussian PDF over an interval can be expressed using its cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi(\\ell \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)$. Specifically, $\\int_{a}^{b} \\phi(\\ell \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)\\,d\\ell = \\Phi(b \\mid \\mu, \\sigma) - \\Phi(a \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)$. The Gaussian CDF can be computed from the standard normal CDF, $\\Phi_{std}(z) = \\Phi(z|0,1)$, as $\\Phi(\\ell \\mid \\mu, \\sigma) = \\Phi_{std}((\\ell-\\mu)/\\sigma)$. The standard normal CDF is related to the error function, $\\operatorname{erf}(x)$, by $\\Phi_{std}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\operatorname{erf}(z/\\sqrt{2}))$.\nThus, for each Gaussian component $k$ and bin $i$:\n$$\n\\int_{b_i}^{b_{i+1}} \\phi(\\ell \\mid \\mu_k, \\sigma_{C,k})\\,d\\ell = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{b_{i+1}-\\mu_k}{\\sigma_{C,k}}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{b_i-\\mu_k}{\\sigma_{C,k}}\\right)\n$$\nAfter computing $I_{C,i}$ for all $i=1,\\dots,9$, we find the total unnormalized mass over the considered range $[b_1, b_{10}) = [0, 1000)$:\n$$\nS_C = \\sum_{j=1}^{9} I_{C,j} = \\int_{0}^{1000} f_C(\\ell)\\, d\\ell\n$$\nThe final bin probabilities are then obtained by normalization:\n$$\np_{C,i} = \\frac{I_{C,i}}{S_C}\n$$\nThis process is performed for both class $\\mathrm{H}$ and class $\\mathrm{T}$ to obtain the probability vectors $\\mathbf{p}_\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathbf{p}_\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nThe complete algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Define the model parameters: means $\\mu_k$, weights $w_{C,k}$, standard deviations $\\sigma_{C,k}$ for $C \\in \\{\\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{T}\\}$, and bin edges $b_i$.\n2.  Compute the probability vector $\\mathbf{p}_\\mathrm{H}$ by integrating the mixture density $f_\\mathrm{H}(\\ell)$ over each of the $9$ bins and normalizing the results.\n3.  Compute the probability vector $\\mathbf{p}_\\mathrm{T}$ similarly, using $f_\\mathrm{T}(\\ell)$.\n4.  For each test case given by a count vector $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, \\dots, c_9)$:\n    a. Calculate the log-likelihood score for class $\\mathrm{H}$: $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathrm{H}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} c_i \\log p_{\\mathrm{H},i}$.\n    b. Calculate the log-likelihood score for class $\\mathrm{T}$: $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathrm{T}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} c_i \\log p_{\\mathrm{T},i}$.\n    c. Compare the scores. If $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathrm{H}) > \\mathcal{L}(\\mathrm{T})$, the sample is classified as Healthy ($\\mathrm{H}$), represented by the boolean `True`. Otherwise, it is classified as Tumor ($\\mathrm{T}$), represented by `False`.\n5.  Collect the boolean results for all test cases and format them as required.\nThis procedure will be implemented to solve the problem for the given test cases.",

The specific functional form of $\\lambda_i$ differs between the two hypotheses, $H_C$ and $H_I$, capturing the distinct biophysical scenarios.\n\nThe likelihood of observing the entire dataset $\\{c_i\\}_{i=0}^{L-1}$ under a hypothesis $H \\in \\{H_C, H_I\\}$ is given by the product of individual Poisson probabilities:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\{c_i\\}\\mid H) = \\prod_{i=0}^{L-1} \\frac{\\left(\\lambda_i^{(H)}\\right)^{c_i} e^{-\\lambda_i^{(H)}}}{c_i!}\n$$\nDirect computation and comparison of these likelihoods can be numerically unstable due to the product of many small probabilities, which can lead to floating-point underflow. A standard and mathematically equivalent approach is to compare the log-likelihoods. Since the natural logarithm is a strictly monotonic function, the inequality $\\mathbb{P}(\\{c_i\\}\\mid H_C) > \\mathbb{P}(\\{c_i\\}\\mid H_I)$ is equivalent to $\\log\\mathbb{P}(\\{c_i\\}\\mid H_C) > \\log\\mathbb{P}(\\{c_i\\}\\mid H_I)$.\n\nThe log-likelihood, $\\mathcal{L}(H)$, is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(H) = \\log \\mathbb{P}(\\{c_i\\}\\mid H) = \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \\left( c_i \\log(\\lambda_i^{(H)}) - \\lambda_i^{(H)} - \\log(c_i!) \\right)\n$$\nWhen comparing $\\mathcal{L}(H_C)$ and $\\mathcal{L}(H_I)$, the term $\\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \\log(c_i!)$ is common to both and can be eliminated. The decision rule simplifies to comparing the reduced log-likelihood scores, which we may denote as $S_H$:\n$$\nS_H = \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \\left( c_i \\log(\\lambda_i^{(H)}) - \\lambda_i^{(H)} \\right)\n$$\nThe cooperative hypothesis $H_C$ is deemed more probable if $S_C > S_I$.\n\nThe solution, therefore, requires a systematic computation of the rate vectors $\\{\\lambda_i^{(C)}\\}$ and $\\{\\lambda_i^{(I)}\\}$ for each test case, followed by the calculation and comparison of their respective scores $S_C$ and $S_I$.\n\nStep-by-step procedure for each test case:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Position Vector**: The global parameters $L=41, b=5.0, f=0.2, a=1.2, s=1.0, w=3$ are fixed. The integer positions are represented by a vector $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 40\\}$. The Gaussian shape function is $G(x) = \\exp(-x^2 / (2s^2))$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Rates under Hypothesis $H_C$**:\n    - For given motif centers $m_1$ and $m_2$, determine the boundaries of the cooperative footprint: $e_1 = \\min(m_1, m_2) - w$ and $e_2 = \\max(m_1, m_2) + w$.\n    - The interior of the cooperative footprint is the set of integers $I_C = [e_1, e_2]$.\n    - For each position $i$, the rate $\\lambda_i^{(C)}$ is calculated. The rate consists of a base component and an enhancement component.\n        - The base component models the footprint itself: it is $b \\cdot f$ for $i \\in I_C$ (attenuation) and $b$ for $i \\notin I_C$ (background).\n        - The enhancement component models the increased cut probability at the footprint edges: $b \\cdot a \\cdot [G(i - e_1) + G(i - e_2)]$.\n    - The total rate is $\\lambda_i^{(C)} = b \\cdot (f \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{i \\in I_C\\}} + \\mathbf{1}_{\\{i \\notin I_C\\}}) + b \\cdot a \\cdot [G(i - e_1) + G(i - e_2)]$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Rates under Hypothesis $H_I$**:\n    - The independent binding hypothesis models two separate footprints. The four edges are $e_{1a} = m_1 - w$, $e_{1b} = m_1 + w$, $e_{2a} = m_2 - w$, and $e_{2b} = m_2 + w$.\n    - The interior of the independent footprints is the union of two sets, $I_I = [m_1-w, m_1+w] \\cup [m_2-w, m_2+w]$.\n    - For each position $i$, the rate $\\lambda_i^{(I)}$ is calculated.\n        - The base component is $b \\cdot f$ for $i \\in I_I$ and $b$ for $i \\notin I_I$.\n        - The enhancement component is derived from all four edges: $b \\cdot a \\cdot [G(i - e_{1a}) + G(i - e_{1b}) + G(i - e_{2a}) + G(i - e_{2b})]$.\n    - The total rate is $\\lambda_i^{(I)} = b \\cdot (f \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{i \\in I_I\\}} + \\mathbf{1}_{\\{i \\notin I_I\\}}) + b \\cdot a \\cdot [G(i - e_{1a}) + G(i - e_{1b}) + G(i - e_{2a}) + G(i - e_{2b})]$.\n\n4.  **Compute Scores and Conclude**:\n    - Using the observed counts $\\{c_i\\}$ and the calculated rate vectors $\\{\\lambda_i^{(C)}\\}$ and $\\{\\lambda_i^{(I)}\\}$, compute the two scores:\n      $S_C = \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} (c_i \\log(\\lambda_i^{(C)}) - \\lambda_i^{(C)})$\n      $S_I = \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} (c_i \\log(\\lambda_i^{(I)}) - \\lambda_i^{(I)})$\n    - The result for the test case is the boolean value of the expression $S_C > S_I$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the three test cases provided, and the resulting boolean values are collected into a list for final output.",

            "problem": "You are given a simplified generative model for Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) fragment features along a one-dimensional genome coordinate system. The goal is to segment the genome into discrete chromatin accessibility states using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), based on two features observed at each genomic position: fragment length in base pairs and local fragment density (counts in a fixed-width window). The three hidden states are: accessible chromatin, nucleosome-array chromatin, and inaccessible chromatin. Each state emits an observation consisting of a pair of values: fragment length (in base pairs) and count (dimensionless). Your task is to implement the Viterbi decoding algorithm to infer the most likely sequence of hidden states for a sequence of observations, given fixed HMM parameters.\n\nStart from the core definition of a Hidden Markov Model and the assumption that observations are generated conditionally independently given the hidden state at each position. Assume that fragment length is modeled by a Gaussian (Normal) distribution and count by a Poisson distribution, and that, conditioned on the hidden state, these two features are independent so that the joint emission probability is the product of the two distributions. Use only the definitions of the Gaussian density and the Poisson probability mass function, along with the Markov property for transitions, to derive the required dynamic programming recurrences in your design. Do not use any external training or parameter estimation; all model parameters are provided below.\n\nModel specification:\n- Hidden states: accessible chromatin, nucleosome-array chromatin, inaccessible chromatin, indexed as $0$, $1$, and $2$, respectively.\n- Initial state probabilities: $\\pi = \\left[\\tfrac{1}{3}, \\tfrac{1}{3}, \\tfrac{1}{3}\\right]$.\n- State transition matrix $A$ (rows are current state, columns are next state):\n  - From state $0$: to $0$ with probability $0.96$, to $1$ with probability $0.02$, to $2$ with probability $0.02$.\n  - From state $1$: to $0$ with probability $0.02$, to $1$ with probability $0.96$, to $2$ with probability $0.02$.\n  - From state $2$: to $0$ with probability $0.02$, to $1$ with probability $0.02$, to $2$ with probability $0.96$.\n- Emission parameters per state $s \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$:\n  - Fragment length $x$ (in base pairs) follows a Normal distribution with mean $\\mu_s$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_s$:\n    - State $0$: $\\mu_0 = 50$, $\\sigma_0 = 15$.\n    - State $1$: $\\mu_1 = 200$, $\\sigma_1 = 25$.\n    - State $2$: $\\mu_2 = 300$, $\\sigma_2 = 40$.\n  - Count $k$ follows a Poisson distribution with rate $\\lambda_s$:\n    - State $0$: $\\lambda_0 = 8$.\n    - State $1$: $\\lambda_1 = 3$.\n    - State $2$: $\\lambda_2 = 0.3$.\n- Conditional independence of features given the hidden state: for a given state $s$, the joint emission density for an observation $(x,k)$ is $p(x,k \\mid s) = p_{\\text{Normal}}(x \\mid \\mu_s,\\sigma_s) \\cdot p_{\\text{Poisson}}(k \\mid \\lambda_s)$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test case $1$ (happy path, length $8$; fragment length in base pairs, counts unitless):\n  - Observations: $[(55, 9), (48, 7), (60, 8), (195, 3), (210, 4), (185, 3), (330, 0), (345, 1)]$.\n- Test case $2$ (boundary condition, length $1$):\n  - Observations: $[(52, 8)]$.\n- Test case $3$ (transition behavior, length $5$):\n  - Observations: $[(50, 8), (62, 7), (70, 6), (205, 4), (198, 3)]$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Implement numerically stable Viterbi decoding in log-space for the provided HMM with the above parameters, using only the definitions of the Normal density and Poisson probability mass function, and the Markov property.\n- Decode each observation sequence into the most likely state sequence, using the state indices $0$ for accessible, $1$ for nucleosome-array, and $2$ for inaccessible.\n- Produce a single line of output containing the decoded state sequences for all test cases as a comma-separated list of lists enclosed in square brackets. For example, the format must be like $[\\,[s_{1,1}, s_{1,2}, \\dots],\\,[s_{2,1}, \\dots],\\,[s_{3,1}, \\dots]\\,]$ where $s_{i,j}$ are integers.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each test case represented as a list of integers, and without any additional text.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a canonical application of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to segment a sequence of observations into a sequence of generating hidden states. Specifically, we must find the most probable sequence of chromatin accessibility states given a series of observations from a simplified ATAC-seq experiment. The appropriate algorithm for this task is the Viterbi algorithm, which finds this most likely state sequence through dynamic programming. The requirement for numerical stability dictates that all calculations must be performed in logarithmic space to prevent arithmetic underflow from the multiplication of many small probability values.\n\nFirst, we formalize the components of the specified Hidden Markov Model.\nLet the set of hidden states be $S = \\{s_0, s_1, s_2\\}$, corresponding to 'accessible', 'nucleosome-array', and 'inaccessible' chromatin, indexed by $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe observation sequence is $O = (o_1, o_2, \\ldots, o_T)$, where $T$ is the length of the sequence. Each observation $o_t$ is a pair $(x_t, k_t)$, where $x_t$ is the fragment length and $k_t$ is the local fragment count.\n\nThe HMM is defined by the following parameters:\n1.  **Initial State Probabilities ($\\pi$)**: The probability of starting in state $s_i$ is $\\pi_i = P(q_1 = s_i)$. The problem specifies a uniform initial distribution: $\\pi = [\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}]$. In log-space, $\\log(\\pi_i) = -\\log(3)$ for all $i$.\n\n2.  **State Transition Probabilities ($A$)**: The probability of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$ is $A_{ij} = P(q_{t+1} = s_j | q_t = s_i)$. The given transition matrix is:\n    $$\n    A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.96  0.02  0.02 \\\\ 0.02  0.96  0.02 \\\\ 0.02  0.02  0.96 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    We will work with the matrix of log-probabilities, $\\log(A_{ij})$.\n\n3.  **Emission Probabilities ($b$)**: The probability of observing $o_t = (x_t, k_t)$ given the system is in state $s_j$ is $b_j(o_t) = P(o_t | q_t = s_j)$. The problem states that fragment length $x_t$ and count $k_t$ are conditionally independent given the state. Thus, the joint emission probability is the product of the individual probabilities:\n    $$\n    b_j(o_t) = P(x_t | q_t=s_j) \\cdot P(k_t | q_t=s_j)\n    $$\n    The fragment length $x_t$ is modeled by a Normal (Gaussian) distribution, $p_{\\text{Normal}}(x_t | \\mu_j, \\sigma_j)$, and the count $k_t$ by a Poisson distribution, $p_{\\text{Poisson}}(k_t | \\lambda_j)$. The parameters are state-dependent:\n    -   State $s_0$: $\\mu_0 = 50$, $\\sigma_0 = 15$, $\\lambda_0 = 8$.\n    -   State $s_1$: $\\mu_1 = 200$, $\\sigma_1 = 25$, $\\lambda_1 = 3$.\n    -   State $s_2$: $\\mu_2 = 300$, $\\sigma_2 = 40$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.3$.\n\nThe log of the emission probability is the sum of the log-probabilities of the two distributions:\n$$\n\\log(b_j(x_t, k_t)) = \\log(p_{\\text{Normal}}(x_t | \\mu_j, \\sigma_j)) + \\log(p_{\\text{Poisson}}(k_t | \\lambda_j))\n$$\nThe log-probability density function of the Normal distribution is:\n$$\n\\log(p_{\\text{Normal}}(x | \\mu, \\sigma)) = -\\log(\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}) - \\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = -\\log(\\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi) - \\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\n$$\nThe log-probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is:\n$$\n\\log(p_{\\text{Poisson}}(k | \\lambda)) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\\right) = k\\log(\\lambda) - \\lambda - \\log(k!)\n$$\nThe term $\\log(k!)$ is computed numerically as $\\log(\\Gamma(k+1))$, where $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n\nThe Viterbi algorithm finds the most probable sequence of states $Q^* = (q_1^*, q_2^*, \\ldots, q_T^*)$ by finding a path through the state-time trellis that maximizes the joint probability $P(O, Q)$. In log-space, this is equivalent to maximizing the sum of log-probabilities. We define two dynamic programming tables:\n-   $V_t(j)$: The log-probability of the most probable state sequence of length $t$ ending in state $s_j$.\n-   $\\psi_t(j)$: The backpointer, which stores the index of the most likely predecessor state for a path ending in state $s_j$ at time $t$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in three steps:\n1.  **Initialization ($t=1$)**: For each state $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, we compute the log-probability for the first observation:\n    $$\n    V_1(j) = \\log(\\pi_j) + \\log(b_j(o_1))\n    $$\n    The backpointers $\\psi_1(j)$ are not needed for the first step and can be initialized to $0$.\n\n2.  **Recursion ($t=2, \\ldots, T$)**: We iterate through each time step and each state, extending the most probable paths from time $t-1$. For each state $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n    $$\n    V_t(j) = \\log(b_j(o_t)) + \\max_{i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}} \\left( V_{t-1}(i) + \\log(A_{ij}) \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\psi_t(j) = \\arg\\max_{i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}} \\left( V_{t-1}(i) + \\log(A_{ij}) \\right)\n    $$\n    Here, the sum inside the $\\max$ function corresponds to the multiplication of probabilities: $P(\\text{path to } i) \\cdot P(\\text{transition } i \\to j)$. The maximization finds the single most probable path leading to state $j$ at time $t$.\n\n3.  **Termination and Path Backtracking**: After completing the tables up to time $T$, the log-probability of the optimal path is $P^* = \\max_{j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}} (V_T(j))$. The final state of the path is:\n    $$\n    q_T^* = \\arg\\max_{j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}} (V_T(j))\n    $$\n    We then backtrack from this final state to reconstruct the entire path.
