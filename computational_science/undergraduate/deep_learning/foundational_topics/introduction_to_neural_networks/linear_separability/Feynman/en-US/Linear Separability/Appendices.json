            "problem": "You are given two finite sets of points in the Euclidean plane: a set of red points and a set of blue points. Each point has integer Cartesian coordinates. Define strict linear separability as follows: the two sets are strictly linearly separable if there exists a straight line such that all red points lie in one open half-plane determined by that line and all blue points lie in the other open half-plane. You must determine strict linear separability for multiple test cases.\n\nYou must base your reasoning only on fundamental definitions about lines, half-planes, orientation, and convexity, without using any specialized theorems beyond these definitions in the problem statement itself. The final answer must be computed purely from the coordinates.\n\nInput is not provided at runtime. Instead, the program must internally evaluate the following test suite of six cases. For each case, the first list is the set of red points and the second list is the set of blue points:\n- Case $1$: red points $\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\\}$, blue points $\\{(5,5),(6,5),(5,6),(6,6)\\}$.\n- Case $2$: red points $\\{(-2,-2),(2,-2),(2,2),(-2,2)\\}$, blue points $\\{(0,0),(1,0),(-1,0)\\}$.\n- Case $3$: red points $\\{(0,0),(0,2),(1,0)\\}$, blue points $\\{(1,0),(2,-1),(2,1)\\}$.\n- Case $4$: red points $\\{(0,0)\\}$, blue points $\\{(5,5),(6,5)\\}$.\n- Case $5$: red points $\\{(0,0),(2,0)\\}$, blue points $\\{(1,-1),(1,1)\\}$.\n- Case $6$: red points $\\{(-3,0),(-2,0),(-1,0)\\}$, blue points $\\{(2,0),(3,0)\\}$.\n\nAll coordinates are integers and should be treated exactly as given. Angles, if any are considered internally, must be treated purely algebraically via orientation predicates; do not use angle units. No physical units are involved.\n\nYour program must compute, for each case, a boolean indicating whether the two sets are strictly linearly separable according to the definition above. The final output format must be a single line containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, `[True, False, True]`, but using the standard Python boolean literals.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[True,False,True,False,True,True]\").",
            "solution": "The problem requires determining if two finite sets of points in the Euclidean plane, designated as red ($R$) and blue ($B$), are strictly linearly separable. Strict linear separability is defined by the existence of a line $L$ that partitions the plane into two open half-planes, one containing all points of $R$ and the other containing all points of $B$. The solution must be derived from fundamental principles of geometry, namely lines, half-planes, orientation, and convexity.\n\nThe cornerstone of the solution lies in a fundamental principle connecting linear separability to the geometric properties of convex sets. Specifically, two finite sets of points $R$ and $B$ are strictly linearly separable if and only if their convex hulls, $CH(R)$ and $CH(B)$, are disjoint, i.e., $CH(R) \\cap CH(B) = \\emptyset$. This principle can be justified from basic definitions as follows:\n\n1.  **Separability of Sets implies Disjoint Hulls**: Assume $R$ and $B$ are strictly separated by a line $L$ defined by the equation $f(p) = ax+by+c=0$. This means that for all red points $p_r \\in R$, $f(p_r) > 0$, and for all blue points $p_b \\in B$, $f(p_b) < 0$. The convex hull of a set of points, say $CH(R)$, consists of all points $p$ that can be expressed as a convex combination of points in $R$: $p = \\sum_i \\alpha_i p_{r_i}$ with $\\alpha_i \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_i \\alpha_i = 1$. Applying the linear function $f$ to such a point $p$ yields $f(p) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i f(p_{r_i})$. Since every $f(p_{r_i}) > 0$ and the $\\alpha_i$ are non-negative (and not all zero), it follows that $f(p) > 0$. Therefore, all points in $CH(R)$ lie in the same open half-plane as the points of $R$. A symmetric argument shows that all points in $CH(B)$ lie in the other open half-plane. Consequently, if $R$ and $B$ are strictly linearly separable, their convex hulls $CH(R)$ and $CH(B)$ must also be strictly separated by the same line, and thus their intersection is empty.\n\n2.  **Disjoint Hulls imply Separability of Sets**: Assume the convex hulls $CH(R)$ and $CH(B)$ are disjoint. The convex hull of a finite set of points is a compact convex set. The Hyperplane Separation Theorem, a foundational result in convex geometry, states that for any two non-empty disjoint compact convex sets in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a hyperplane that strictly separates them. In the 2D plane, this means there is a line $L$ that strictly separates $CH(R)$ and $CH(B)$. Since $R \\subseteq CH(R)$ and $B \\subseteq CH(B)$, this line $L$ also strictly separates the original point sets $R$ and $B$.\n\nBased on this equivalence, the problem is transformed from searching for a separating line in an infinite space of possibilities to a concrete geometric problem: computing the convex hulls of the two point sets and determining if these hulls intersect.\n\nThe algorithmic solution thus proceeds in two main stages:\n\n**Stage 1: Convex Hull Computation**\nFor each set of points ($R$ and $B$), we compute its convex hull. The Monotone Chain algorithm (also known as Andrew's algorithm) is an effective method that relies on the concept of orientation. The orientation of an ordered triplet of points $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ determines whether the path from $p_1$ to $p_2$ to $p_3$ constitutes a \"left turn\" (counter-clockwise), a \"right turn\" (clockwise), or are collinear. This is calculated using the sign of the 2D cross product of the vectors $\\vec{p_1p_2}$ and $\\vec{p_1p_3}$:\n$$ \\text{orientation}(p_1, p_2, p_3) = (x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (y_2 - y_1)(x_3 - x_1) $$\nA positive sign indicates a left turn, a negative sign a right turn, and zero indicates collinearity.\nThe Monotone Chain algorithm works by first sorting the points lexicographically (by $x$, then $y$ coordinate). It then constructs the upper and lower chains of the hull by iterating through the sorted points and using the orientation predicate to maintain convexity. The final hull is represented as a polygon defined by an ordered list of its vertices. This procedure correctly handles degenerate cases, such as when all points are collinear, in which case the \"hull\" is a line segment.\n\n**Stage 2: Convex Polygon Intersection Test**\nWith the two convex hulls, $CH(R)$ and $CH(B)$, represented as convex polygons (or line segments, or points), we must test if they intersect. Two convex polygons, $P_1$ and $P_2$, intersect if and only if at least one of the following conditions is met:\na) An edge of $P_1$ intersects an edge of $P_2$.\nb) $P_1$ is entirely contained within $P_2$.\nc) $P_2$ is entirely contained within $P_1$.\n\nA comprehensive test for these conditions is as follows:\n1.  **Check for vertex containment**: Iterate through each vertex of $P_1$ and check if it lies inside or on the boundary of $P_2$. A point is inside a convex polygon if it lies to the left of or on every directed edge of the polygon (assuming a counter-clockwise vertex ordering). This test also relies on the orientation predicate. If any vertex of $P_1$ is inside $P_2$, the hulls intersect. Symmetrically, check if any vertex of $P_2$ is inside $P_1$. This covers condition (b) and (c), as well as many intersection cases.\n2.  **Check for edge-edge intersection**: If no vertex of one polygon is contained in the other, it is still possible for their edges to intersect. Iterate through every edge of $P_1$ and every edge of $P_2$, and test if the pair of line segments intersect. A segment intersection test can also be implemented using the orientation predicate.\n\nIf any of these checks reveal an intersection, the algorithm concludes that $CH(R) \\cap CH(B) \\neq \\emptyset$, and therefore the sets $R$ and $B$ are not strictly linearly separable. If all checks are completed without finding an intersection, the hulls are disjoint, and the sets are strictly linearly separable. This approach provides a complete and robust solution derived from the specified fundamental principles. The degenerate cases where one or both hulls are line segments or single points are handled naturally by this general intersection logic. For instance, if a point is shared between the red and blue sets, it will be a vertex in both hulls, satisfying the containment test and correctly identifying the sets as non-separable.",

Linear Separability in the Original Space ($m=0$)**\nA linear classifier in the original space has a decision function $f(x) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b$. For the dataset to be linearly separable, there must exist parameters $(w_1, w_2, b)$ such that $y(x)(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b) > 0$ for all four points. This leads to the following system of strict inequalities:\n1. $(+1)(w_1 + w_2 + b) > 0 \\implies w_1 + w_2 + b > 0$\n2. $(+1)(-w_1 - w_2 + b) > 0 \\implies -w_1 - w_2 + b > 0$\n3. $(-1)(w_1 - w_2 + b) > 0 \\implies w_1 - w_2 + b  0$\n4. $(-1)(-w_1 + w_2 + b) > 0 \\implies -w_1 + w_2 + b  0$\n\nAdding inequalities (1) and (2) gives $(w_1 + w_2 + b) + (-w_1 - w_2 + b) > 0$, which simplifies to $2b > 0$, or $b > 0$.\nAdding inequalities (3) and (4) gives $(w_1 - w_2 + b) + (-w_1 + w_2 + b)  0$, which simplifies to $2b  0$, or $b  0$.\nThe requirement that $b > 0$ and $b  0$ is a contradiction. Therefore, no such parameters exist, and the dataset is not linearly separable in the original $\\mathbb{R}^2$ space. This corresponds to the case $m=0$.\n\n**3. Linear Separability in the Augmented Space ($m \\ge 1$)**\nThe augmented classifier uses $m$ identical features $z_k(x) = x_1 x_2$. The decision function is:\n$$ f_m(x) = \\tilde{w}_1 x_1 + \\tilde{w}_2 x_2 + \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\tilde{v}_k (x_1 x_2) + \\tilde{b} $$\nLet $W_v = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\tilde{v}_k$. The decision function can be rewritten as:\n$$ f_m(x) = \\tilde{w}_1 x_1 + \\tilde{w}_2 x_2 + W_v (x_1 x_2) + \\tilde{b} $$\nThis is a linear classifier in the 3D feature space defined by the mapping $\\phi(x) = (x_1, x_2, x_1 x_2)$. The question is what is the minimum $m$ required to make $W_v$ potentially non-zero.\n- If $m=0$, the sum for $W_v$ is empty, so $W_v=0$. The classifier reduces to the original one, which is insufficient.\n- If $m \\ge 1$, we are free to choose the weights $\\tilde{v}_k$. For instance, with $m=1$, we can choose $\\tilde{v}_1 \\neq 0$. In general, for any $m \\ge 1$, we can choose weights such that $W_v = \\sum \\tilde{v}_k \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's test if separability is achievable for $m=1$. This is equivalent to checking if the data is linearly separable in the feature space $(x_1, x_2, x_1 x_2)$.\nWe need to find parameters $(\\tilde{w}_1, \\tilde{w}_2, \\tilde{v}_1, \\tilde{b})$ that satisfy the separability conditions. Consider the simple choice of parameters: $\\tilde{w}_1 = 0$, $\\tilde{w}_2 = 0$, $\\tilde{b}=0$, and $\\tilde{v}_1 = 1$. The decision function becomes $f_1(x) = x_1 x_2$.\nLet's check the condition $y(x) f_1(x) > 0$:\n- For points with label $y=+1$: $x_1 x_2 = 1$. The condition is $(+1)(1) = 1 > 0$. This holds.\n- For points with label $y=-1$: $x_1 x_2 = -1$. The condition is $(-1)(-1) = 1 > 0$. This holds.\n\nSince we have found a valid set of parameters for $m=1$ that linearly separates the data, and we showed $m=0$ is insufficient, the minimal integer value is $m^\\star = 1$.",

Train $(W_1,b_1,w_2,b_2)$ by minimizing the empirical hinge loss $L = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\max(0, 1 - y_i o_i)$ via gradient descent on the parameters. After training, assess linear separability of the hidden representation $\\{(z_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ by solving a linear program that maximizes a margin variable $\\gamma$ subject to an $\\ell_1$ norm bound on $(w,b)$, namely $\\|w\\|_1 + |b| \\le 1$, and the constraints $y_i(w^\\top z_i + b) \\ge \\gamma$ for all $i$. If the optimal $\\gamma$ is strictly positive, declare the hidden representation linearly separable; otherwise, declare it not linearly separable. Justify this test by the scaling property: if some $(w,b)$ separates the data, then scaling to satisfy $\\|w\\|_1 + |b| \\le 1$ preserves a strictly positive margin, hence a positive $\\gamma$ exists.\n\nTest Suite. Use $a = 0.5$ and $N_c = 128$ samples per class ($n = 2N_c$). Evaluate the network with the following hidden sizes $m$: $m \\in \\{4,8,16,32\\}$, which respectively probe an edge case (small capacity), a moderate case, a typical case, and a larger capacity case. For each $m$, train the network as specified and then run the linear separability test on the hidden representation. The output for each test case must be a boolean indicating whether the hidden representation is linearly separable (True for separable, False for not). Additionally, compute and output the smallest hidden size among the tested values that yields separability; if none yields separability, output $0$ for that value.\n\nFinal Output Format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with entries ordered to correspond to $m = 4,8,16,32$, followed by the smallest $m$ that yields separability (or $0$ if none), for example, $[b_4,b_8,b_{16},b_{32},m_{\\text{min}}]$, where each $b_m$ is a boolean and $m_{\\text{min}}$ is an integer. No physical units are required for the output. Angles must be in radians. All computations must be purely numerical and self-contained, with no external input.",
            "solution": "We start from core definitions and properties underlying the problem. A dataset $\\{(x_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ with $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $y_i \\in \\{-1,+1\\}$ is linearly separable if there exists $(w,b)$ such that $y_i(w^\\top x_i + b)  0$ for every $i$. A two-layer Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) network computes $z = \\sigma(W_1 x + b_1)$, with $\\sigma(t) = \\max\\{0,t\\}$ element-wise, and $o = w_2^\\top z + b_2$. The function $\\sigma$ is piecewise linear, and thus the composition with affine maps yields a piecewise linear mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$. When followed by a linear classifier in the hidden space, the overall decision boundary in the input space is a union of polytopes, which can approximate curved boundaries with increasing fidelity as the number of hidden neurons $m$ increases.\n\nDataset construction uses polar coordinates: for class $+1$, define angles $\\theta \\in [0,4\\pi]$ in radians, radii $r = a\\theta$, and Cartesian coordinates $x = (r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta)$; for class $-1$, shift angles by $\\pi$, so $\\theta' = \\theta + \\pi$, radii $r' = a\\theta'$, and $x' = (r'\\cos\\theta', r'\\sin\\theta')$. With $a = 0.5$ and $N_c = 128$ per class, we obtain $n = 256$ points forming two intertwined spirals. This dataset is not linearly separable in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ due to the repeatedly alternating winding structure.\n\nTraining aims to find parameters $(W_1,b_1,w_2,b_2)$ such that the hidden representation $z_i = \\sigma(W_1 x_i + b_1)$ is arranged in a configuration admitting linear separation. We minimize the empirical hinge loss\n$$\nL(W_1,b_1,w_2,b_2) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\max\\{0, 1 - y_i (w_2^\\top z_i + b_2)\\}\n$$\nvia gradient descent. The hinge loss subgradient with respect to the outputs $o_i = w_2^\\top z_i + b_2$ is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial o_i} = \n\\begin{cases}\n-\\frac{y_i}{n},  \\text{if } 1 - y_i o_i  0, \\\\\n0,  \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, the gradients propagate through the ReLU nonlinearity: if $p_i = W_1 x_i + b_1$ and $z_i = \\sigma(p_i)$, then $\\frac{\\partial z_{i,j}}{\\partial p_{i,j}} = \\mathbb{I}\\{p_{i,j}  0\\}$, and\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_1} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial o_i} \\cdot w_2 \\right) \\odot \\mathbb{I}\\{p_i  0\\} \\right) x_i^\\top, \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b_1} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial o_i} \\cdot w_2 \\right) \\odot \\mathbb{I}\\{p_i  0\\} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_2} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial o_i} z_i$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b_2} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial o_i}$. Gradient descent with a decaying step size is applied to update all parameters.\n\nTo assess linear separability of the hidden representation $\\{(z_i,y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, we use a linear program that maximizes a margin variable $\\gamma$ under an $\\ell_1$ norm bound $\\|w\\|_1 + |b| \\le 1$, imposing $y_i(w^\\top z_i + b) \\ge \\gamma$ for all $i$. This yields the optimization problem:\n$$\n\\max_{w,b,\\gamma,u,v} \\ \\gamma \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad\ny_i(w^\\top z_i + b) - \\gamma \\ge 0 \\ \\forall i, \\quad\nu_j \\ge w_j, \\ u_j \\ge -w_j \\ \\forall j, \\quad\nv \\ge b, \\ v \\ge -b, \\quad\n\\sum_j u_j + v \\le 1, \\quad\nu_j \\ge 0, \\ v \\ge 0, \\ \\gamma \\ge 0.\n$$\nThis is a linear program after introducing auxiliary variables $u_j$ and $v$ to enforce absolute values in the $\\ell_1$ bound. Solving it with the objective $\\min -\\gamma$ (equivalently $\\max \\gamma$) yields an optimal $\\gamma^\\star$. The key justification relies on the scaling property: suppose some $(\\tilde{w},\\tilde{b})$ separates the data, meaning $\\min_i y_i(\\tilde{w}^\\top z_i + \\tilde{b}) = \\delta  0$. Let $s = \\|\\tilde{w}\\|_1 + |\\tilde{b}|$ and rescale $(w,b) = (\\tilde{w}/s, \\tilde{b}/s)$; then $\\|w\\|_1 + |b| = 1$ and the resulting margin is $\\min_i y_i(w^\\top z_i + b) = \\delta/s  0$. Thus, linear separability is equivalent to the existence of a strictly positive margin under the $\\ell_1$ bound, and the linear program’s optimal $\\gamma^\\star$ is strictly positive if and only if the hidden representation is linearly separable.\n\nWe test hidden sizes $m \\in \\{4,8,16,32\\}$ to study the effect of capacity. For each $m$, we train the network as described, then solve the linear program to decide separability. The results are reported as booleans for each $m$, followed by the smallest $m$ among the tested values that achieves separability (or $0$ if none). The single-line output format is a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order $[b_4,b_8,b_{16},b_{32},m_{\\text{min}}]$.\n\nAlgorithmic steps implemented in the program:\n$1.$ Generate the two intertwined spirals with $a = 0.5$, $N_c = 128$ (angles in radians), and scale features to a comparable range to improve numerical conditioning.\n$2.$ For each hidden size $m$, initialize parameters and minimize the hinge loss via gradient descent with decaying step size to obtain $(W_1,b_1,w_2,b_2)$.\n$3.$ Compute hidden representations $z_i$, assemble the linear program as above, and solve for $\\gamma^\\star$.\n$4.$ Return True if $\\gamma^\\star  10^{-6}$, else False.\n$5.$ Compute the smallest $m$ among the tested values that yields True; if none, return $0$.\n\nThis procedure integrates core principles: the definition of linear separability and the scaling argument underpinning the $\\ell_1$-bounded margin test, together with algorithmic training of a piecewise linear network to approximate the spiral unwrapping. As $m$ increases, the hidden mapping can partition the input space into more linear regions, facilitating a linear separator in the hidden space for the intertwined spirals.",
