            "problem": "You are given a classification setting with a finite number of classes modeled by a categorical distribution. For an input with unnormalized log-probabilities (called logits) $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ and a one-hot target vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\{0,1\\}^K$ with the correct class index $c$ such that $y_c = 1$, the negative log-likelihood of the correct class under the categorical model defines the Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE). The probability vector is obtained by normalizing exponentials of logits, which is the standard definition of the softmax transformation. From the core definitions of a categorical distribution, negative log-likelihood, properties of the exponential and logarithm, and the invariance of probability ratios under adding a constant to all logits, derive a numerically stable expression for the CCE that does not require forming probabilities via exponentials at the original scale. Your derivation should make explicit use of the identity that expresses a logarithm of a sum of exponentials in a way that avoids overflow or underflow by shifting with a data-dependent constant. Explain why this identity avoids arithmetic overflow when logits have large positive magnitude and avoids underflow when logits have large negative magnitude, using the well-tested fact that double-precision floating-point overflows occur for $\\exp(x)$ when $x \\gtrsim 709$ and underflows to zero when $x \\lesssim -745$.\n\nAdditionally, in the special case of $K=2$ classes, show from first principles that the CCE reduces to the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) between a binary label $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and a Bernoulli model with logit parameter $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ equal to the log-odds induced by the two logits. Express the BCE in a numerically stable form using the SoftPlus function, which is defined solely in terms of elementary functions.\n\nYour program must:\n- Implement a naive CCE that computes the softmax probabilities directly by exponentiating logits and normalizing, then computes the loss for a single example. It should detect failure (overflow or underflow) by checking whether any intermediate or final value becomes non-finite.\n- Implement a numerically stable CCE using an appropriate shift and a stable computation of the logarithm of a sum of exponentials, without ever forming probabilities at the original scale.\n- Implement a numerically stable BCE with logits for the $K=2$ case using the SoftPlus function in a way that prevents overflow and underflow.\n- Apply these implementations to the test suite below and return the requested outputs.\n\nTest suite (each case is a single input with logits $\\mathbf{z}$ and a correct class index $c$):\n- Case $1$: $K=3$, $\\mathbf{z} = [1.0, 0.0, -1.0]$, $c=0$.\n- Case $2$: $K=3$, $\\mathbf{z} = [120.0, 0.0, -120.0]$, $c=1$.\n- Case $3$: $K=3$, $\\mathbf{z} = [1000.0, 999.0, 998.0]$, $c=0$.\n- Case $4$: $K=3$, $\\mathbf{z} = [-1000.0, -1001.0, -1002.0]$, $c=2$.\n- Case $5$ (equivalence check when $K=2$): $\\mathbf{z} = [5.0, -5.0]$, $c=0$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution. We proceed with the derivation and implementation.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of a Numerically Stable Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE)\n\nThe Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) loss is the negative log-likelihood of the true class under a model. For a single data point, given a vector of unnormalized log-probabilities (logits) $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ and the correct class index $c$, we first compute the probability vector $\\mathbf{p}$ using the softmax function:\n$$\np_i = \\frac{\\exp(z_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j)} \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, K\n$$\nThe likelihood of observing the correct class $c$ is $p_c$. The CCE loss is the negative logarithm of this likelihood:\n$$\nL_{\\text{CCE}} = -\\log(p_c) = -\\log\\left(\\frac{\\exp(z_c)}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j)}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\log(a/b) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)$, and that $\\log(\\exp(x)) = x$, we can rewrite the loss as:\n$$\nL_{\\text{CCE}} = -(\\log(\\exp(z_c)) - \\log\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j)\\right)) = -z_c + \\log\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression, while mathematically correct, is numerically unstable. The term $\\sum_j \\exp(z_j)$ is prone to floating-point errors.\n- **Overflow**: If any logit $z_j$ is large and positive (e.g., $z_j \\gtrsim 709$ for double-precision), $\\exp(z_j)$ will evaluate to infinity, causing the entire expression to become non-finite.\n- **Underflow**: If all logits $z_j$ are large and negative (e.g., $z_j \\lesssim -745$), every $\\exp(z_j)$ will underflow to $0$. The sum will be $0$, and its logarithm will be $-\\infty$, again resulting in a non-finite loss.\n\nTo stabilize this computation, we use the \"log-sum-exp\" trick. This relies on the identity that for any constant $m$, the probability ratios are invariant:\n$$\np_i = \\frac{\\exp(z_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j)} = \\frac{\\exp(z_i) \\cdot \\exp(-m)}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j) \\cdot \\exp(-m)} = \\frac{\\exp(z_i - m)}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j - m)}\n$$\nThis invariance allows us to shift the logits without changing the final probabilities. We apply this idea to the term $\\log(\\sum_j \\exp(z_j))$:\n$$\n\\log\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j)\\right) = \\log\\left(\\exp(m) \\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j - m)\\right) = \\log(\\exp(m)) + \\log\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j - m)\\right) = m + \\log\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j - m)\\right)\n$$\nBy choosing $m = \\max_j(z_j)$, we ensure numerical stability:\n1.  **Overflow Prevention**: The argument to the exponential function, $z_j - m$, is now always less than or equal to $0$. The largest value it takes is $z_k - m = m - m = 0$ for the index $k$ where $z_k$ is the maximum. Thus, the largest term in the sum is $\\exp(0) = 1$. This prevents any term from overflowing.\n2.  **Underflow Prevention**: Since at least one term in the sum $\\sum_j \\exp(z_j - m)$ is $\\exp(0)=1$, the sum is guaranteed to be at least $1$. This prevents the argument of the logarithm from underflowing to zero, thereby avoiding a result of $-\\infty$.\n\nSubstituting this stable log-sum-exp expression back into the loss formula, we get the numerically stable CCE:\n$$\nL_{\\text{CCE, stable}} = -z_c + \\left( \\max_j(z_j) + \\log\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(z_j - \\max_j(z_j))\\right) \\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Equivalence of CCE and BCE for $K=2$\n\nFor the special case of a binary classification problem ($K=2$), we will show that CCE is equivalent to Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE). Let the logits be $\\mathbf{z}=[z_0, z_1]$. Let's define a binary random variable with label $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $y=1$ corresponds to class $c=1$ and $y=0$ to class $c=0$.\n\nThe probability of class $1$ is given by the sigmoid (logistic) function of the log-odds. The log-odds for class $1$ versus class $0$ is $a = z_1 - z_0$. The probability $p_1$ is:\n$$\np_1 = P(y=1) = \\frac{\\exp(z_1)}{\\exp(z_0) + \\exp(z_1)} = \\frac{\\exp(z_1-z_0)}{\\exp(z_0-z_0) + \\exp(z_1-z_0)} = \\frac{\\exp(a)}{1 + \\exp(a)} = \\sigma(a)\n$$\nThe probability of class $0$ is $p_0 = 1 - p_1 = 1 - \\sigma(a) = \\sigma(-a)$. The BCE loss for a binary label $y$ and logit $a$ is:\n$$\nL_{\\text{BCE}} = -[y \\log(p_1) + (1-y) \\log(p_0)] = -[y \\log(\\sigma(a)) + (1-y) \\log(\\sigma(-a))]\n$$\nNow, let's analyze the CCE loss for $K=2$: $L_{\\text{CCE}} = -z_c + \\log(\\exp(z_0) + \\exp(z_1))$.\n- If the true class is $c=1$ (so $y=1$):\n$$\nL_{\\text{CCE}}(c=1) = -z_1 + \\log(\\exp(z_0) + \\exp(z_1)) = -z_1 + \\log(\\exp(z_1)(\\exp(z_0-z_1) + 1)) = -z_1 + z_1 + \\log(\\exp(-a) + 1) = \\log(1 + \\exp(-a))\n$$\nThe BCE loss for $y=1$ is $-\\log(\\sigma(a)) = -\\log(\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-a)}) = \\log(1+\\exp(-a))$. The expressions match.\n\n- If the true class is $c=0$ (so $y=0$):\n$$\nL_{\\text{CCE}}(c=0) = -z_0 + \\log(\\exp(z_0) + \\exp(z_1)) = -z_0 + \\log(\\exp(z_0)(1 + \\exp(z_1-z_0))) = -z_0 + z_0 + \\log(1 + \\exp(a)) = \\log(1 + \\exp(a))\n$$\nThe BCE loss for $y=0$ is $-\\log(\\sigma(-a)) = -\\log(\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(a)}) = \\log(1+\\exp(a))$. The expressions match again.\nThus, CCE for $K=2$ is equivalent to BCE.\n\n### Part 3: Numerically Stable BCE with SoftPlus\n\nThe SoftPlus function is defined as $\\text{SoftPlus}(x) = \\log(1 + \\exp(x))$. Our derived BCE expressions are $\\text{SoftPlus}(-a)$ for $y=1$ and $\\text{SoftPlus}(a)$ for $y=0$. A unified, more convenient expression for BCE loss is:\n$$\nL_{\\text{BCE}} = -ya + \\text{SoftPlus}(a) = -ya + \\log(1 + \\exp(a))\n$$\nLet's verify this form:\n- For $y=1$: $L = -a + \\log(1+\\exp(a)) = \\log(\\exp(-a)) + \\log(1+\\exp(a)) = \\log(\\exp(-a)(1+\\exp(a))) = \\log(1+\\exp(-a))$. Correct.\n- For $y=0$: $L = \\log(1+\\exp(a))$. Correct.\n\nThis form $L_{\\text{BCE}} = -ya + \\text{SoftPlus}(a)$ is stable, provided that $\\text{SoftPlus}(a)$ is computed stably. The naive computation of $\\text{SoftPlus}(a) = \\log(1+\\exp(a))$ overflows if $a$ is large and positive. We can use the identity $\\log(1+\\exp(a)) = a + \\log(1+\\exp(-a))$. This gives a stable implementation:\n$$\n\\text{SoftPlus}(a) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    \\log(1 + \\exp(a))  \\text{if } a \\le 0 \\\\\n    a + \\log(1 + \\exp(-a))  \\text{if } a > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be written compactly as $\\max(0, a) + \\log(1 + \\exp(-|a|))$. Substituting this into the unified BCE expression yields a fully stable computation for any values of $y$ and $a$.",

Then, demonstrate a case study in which lowering this loss increases accuracy but worsens calibration due to overconfident predictions, and apply temperature scaling to correct calibration while preserving predicted class rankings.\n\nYour program must implement the following steps without using any shortcuts that skip derivations:\n\n- From the principle of maximum likelihood for a multinomial distribution and the softmax construction, derive the expression for the categorical negative log-likelihood loss (commonly known as categorical cross-entropy) as an average over samples.\n- Define and compute classification accuracy as the fraction of samples with predicted class equal to the true class.\n- Define and compute calibration via the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) using confidence binning: partition the interval $[0,1]$ into $B$ equal-width bins, compute for each bin the difference between average confidence and average accuracy, and aggregate a weighted average by the fraction of samples in the bin.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed exercise in machine learning. It asks for the derivation of a fundamental loss function from first principles and its application in a concrete numerical scenario to illustrate the important concepts of model accuracy, confidence, and calibration. All necessary data, definitions, and constraints are provided. We may now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured as follows:\n1.  Derivation of the average negative log-likelihood loss for multi-class classification from the principle of maximum likelihood.\n2.  Formal definitions of the performance metrics: accuracy, confidence, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE).\n3.  Application of these principles to the three test cases provided.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Negative Log-Likelihood Loss**\n\nWe consider a multi-class classification problem with $N$ independent samples and $K$ classes. For each sample $i$ (where $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$), a model takes an input vector $x_i$ and produces a vector of unnormalized scores, or logits, $l_i = (l_{i1}, l_{i2}, \\dots, l_{iK})$.\n\nThe model's predicted probability for each class $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}$ for sample $i$ is obtained by applying the softmax function to the logits:\n$$\np_{ik} = P(\\text{class}=k | x_i) = \\frac{\\exp(l_{ik})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\exp(l_{ij})}\n$$\nThe set of probabilities for sample $i$ is the vector $p_i = (p_{i1}, p_{i2}, \\dots, p_{iK})$. Note that $\\sum_{k=1}^K p_{ik} = 1$ and $p_{ik}  0$ for all $i, k$.\n\nThe ground truth label for sample $i$ is denoted by $c_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}$. We can represent this label using a one-hot encoded vector $y_i$ of length $K$, where its $k$-th component, $y_{ik}$, is given by the indicator function:\n$$\ny_{ik} = \\mathbb{I}(k=c_i) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } k = c_i \\\\ 0  \\text{if } k \\neq c_i \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe outcome of the classification for a single sample can be modeled as a draw from a Categorical distribution, which is a specific case of the Multinomial distribution with one trial ($n=1$). The probability mass function for observing the outcome $y_i$ given the predicted probabilities $p_i$ is:\n$$\nP(Y_i=y_i) = \\prod_{k=1}^{K} p_{ik}^{y_{ik}}\n$$\nSince $y_{ik}$ is $1$ only for the true class $c_i$ and $0$ otherwise, this expression simplifies to $p_{i, c_i}$, the predicted probability of the true class.\n\nThe principle of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) states that we should choose the model parameters (which determine the logits $l_i$) that maximize the likelihood of observing the given dataset. Assuming the $N$ samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the total likelihood of the dataset is the product of the individual sample likelihoods:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(Y_i=y_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\prod_{k=1}^{K} p_{ik}^{y_{ik}}\n$$\nFor numerical stability and mathematical convenience, we work with the log-likelihood:\n$$\n\\log \\mathcal{L} = \\log \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\prod_{k=1}^{K} p_{ik}^{y_{ik}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \\log p_{ik}\n$$\nIn machine learning optimization, it is standard to minimize a loss function rather than maximize a likelihood. Maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL):\n$$\n\\text{NLL} = - \\log \\mathcal{L} = - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \\log p_{ik}\n$$\nThis expression is the definition of the categorical cross-entropy between the true distributions (the one-hot vectors $y_i$) and the predicted distributions ($p_i$). As a loss function for training, we typically use the average NLL per sample:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{1}{N} \\text{NLL} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \\log p_{ik}\n$$\nAgain, since $y_{ik}$ is non-zero only for the true class $c_i$, the inner sum collapses, and the loss function simplifies to:\n$$\nJ = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log p_{i, c_i}\n$$\nThis is the average negative log-likelihood, or categorical cross-entropy loss. By substituting the softmax formula, we can express the loss for a single sample $i$ in terms of its logits $l_i$:\n$$\nJ_i = -\\log p_{i, c_i} = -\\log \\left( \\frac{\\exp(l_{i, c_i})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\exp(l_{ij})} \\right) = \\log\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\exp(l_{ij})\\right) - l_{i, c_i}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n**2. Performance Metrics**\n\nWe define the required metrics as follows:\n\n-   **Accuracy**: The predicted class for sample $i$ is $\\hat{y}_i = \\arg\\max_{k} p_{ik} = \\arg\\max_{k} l_{ik}$. Accuracy is the fraction of correctly classified samples:\n    $$\n    \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_i = c_i)\n    $$\n-   **Confidence**: The confidence of a prediction for sample $i$ is the model's probability assigned to its predicted class, which is simply the maximum probability in the output vector $p_i$:\n    $$\n    \\text{conf}_i = \\max_{k} p_{ik}\n    $$\n-   **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**: ECE measures the discrepancy between confidence and accuracy. The interval $[0,1]$ is partitioned into $B$ equal-width bins, $M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_B$. For each bin $M_b$, we compute the average accuracy and average confidence of all samples whose prediction confidence falls within that bin. Let $I_b$ be the set of sample indices $i$ such that $\\text{conf}_i \\in M_b$, and let $n_b = |I_b|$. If $n_b  0$:\n    $$\n    \\text{acc}(b) = \\frac{1}{n_b} \\sum_{i \\in I_b} \\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_i = c_i)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{conf}(b) = \\frac{1}{n_b} \\sum_{i \\in I_b} \\text{conf}_i\n    $$\n    The ECE is the weighted average of the absolute difference between these quantities over all bins:\n    $$\n    \\text{ECE} = \\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\frac{n_b}{N} \\left| \\text{acc}(b) - \\text{conf}(b) \\right|\n    $$\n    A perfectly calibrated model has an ECE of $0$.\n\n-   **Temperature Scaling**: This is a post-processing technique to improve model calibration. It works by scaling the logits by a positive temperature parameter $T  0$ before the softmax function:\n    $$\n    p_{ik}(T) = \\frac{\\exp(l_{ik}/T)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\exp(l_{ij}/T)}\n    $$\n    A value of $T1$ \"softens\" the probabilities, pushing them closer to a uniform distribution and reducing overconfidence. A key property is that for any $T  0$, temperature scaling does not change the $\\arg\\max$ of the logits, so it does not alter the model's predictions $\\hat{y}_i$ or its accuracy. The optimal temperature $T^\\star$ is found by minimizing a calibration metric, such as ECE, on a validation set.\n\n**3. Application to Test Cases**\n\nWe will now compute the required metrics (accuracy, loss, ECE) for the three specified cases. For all cases, $N=8$, $K=3$, and the ground-truth labels are $y = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2]$.\n\n-   **Case 1**: Baseline logits $L^{(1)}$, using $B=5$ bins for ECE.\n-   **Case 2**: Overconfident logits $L^{(2)}$, using $B=5$ bins for ECE. We expect to see higher accuracy, lower loss, but a higher ECE compared to Case 1, demonstrating the classic accuracy-calibration trade-off.\n-   **Case 3**: Temperature scaling applied to Case 2. We will find the optimal temperature $T^\\star$ from the set $S = \\{1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0\\}$ that minimizes ECE for the data from Case 2. As noted, the accuracy for Case 3 will be identical to that of Case 2. We will then report all three metrics for the model calibrated with $T^\\star$.\n\nThe computations are performed by the program provided in the final answer. The program implements the softmax function, the loss function, accuracy calculation, and the ECE calculation with binning as described above. It then iterates through the cases and computes the required values.",
