This coding exercise challenges you to simulate signal propagation in a deep network and observe the stability of activation variances under different combinations of initialization schemes and activation functions.

Assume zero biases, independently and identically distributed weights, and an input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ whose components are independent, have zero mean, and finite variance. Consider two widely used random weight initialization strategies: Xavier (Glorot) normal initialization and He (Kaiming) normal initialization, and two activation functions: $\\tanh$ and Rectified Linear Unit ($\\mathrm{ReLU}$). The objective is to empirically verify, by Monte Carlo simulation, when an initialization strategy approximately preserves the variance of pre-activations across layers, that is, when $\\operatorname{Var}\\!\\left(z^{(l)}\\right) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}(x)$ for all layers $l \\in \\{1,\\dots,L\\}$ under a given activation function.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- Independence of weights and activations across coordinates at initialization, and linearity of variance for independent sums.\n- The definitions of $\\tanh$ and $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ as pointwise nonlinearities.\n- The sample variance estimator defined for an array $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{s \\times d}$ along the $s$ samples as $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(Y) = \\frac{1}{d}\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\sum_{i=1}^{s} Y_{ij}^{2} - \\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\sum_{i=1}^{s} Y_{ij}\\right)^{2} \\right)$.\n\nYour program must:\n1.

Use zero-mean normal initializations with variances prescribed by each strategy; do not add any biases.\n2. Draw the input $x$ as $s$ independent samples of dimension $n$, each component distributed as $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, i.e., zero mean and variance $1$.\n3. For each layer $l$, compute the empirical pre-activation variance $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}\\!\\left(z^{(l)}\\right)$ over the $s$ samples by averaging per-coordinate sample variances, and compute the empirical input variance $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(x)$ similarly.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of deep learning, specifically concerning weight initialization and its impact on signal propagation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters, definitions, and a clear, objective criterion for success. It is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe objective is to empirically verify the conditions under which the variance of pre-activations, $z^{(l)}$, is preserved across the layers of a deep neural network. The core of this analysis lies in the recursive relationship between the variance of pre-activations in successive layers.\n\nLet us consider a single neuron's pre-activation at layer $l$:\n$$ z_i^{(l)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l-1}} W_{ij}^{(l)} a_j^{(l-1)} $$\nHere, $W_{ij}^{(l)}$ is the weight connecting neuron $j$ of layer $l-1$ to neuron $i$ of layer $l$, and $a_j^{(l-1)}$ is the activation of neuron $j$ from the previous layer. The problem specifies that biases are zero, weights $W_{ij}^{(l)}$ are drawn from a distribution with zero mean, and the input components $x_j$ (which constitute $a_j^{(0)}$) also have zero mean. We assume that at initialization, the activations $a_j^{(l-1)}$ for all $j$ are independent of the weights $W_{ij}^{(l)}$ and are identically distributed. Furthermore, if the activations $a^{(l-1)}$ are the output of a symmetric activation function applied to zero-mean inputs $z^{(l-1)}$, they will also have zero mean. For the $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation, this is not the case, but the resulting pre-activations $z^{(l)}$ will still have zero mean because the weights themselves are zero-mean: $\\mathbb{E}[z_i^{(l)}] = \\sum_j \\mathbb{E}[W_{ij}^{(l)}] \\mathbb{E}[a_j^{(l-1)}] = \\sum_j 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[a_j^{(l-1)}] = 0$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the variance of $z_i^{(l)}$ is given by:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(z_i^{(l)}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l-1}} W_{ij}^{(l)} a_j^{(l-1)}\\right) $$\nDue to the independence of the terms in the sum (as weights and previous layer activations are independent), the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(z_i^{(l)}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l-1}} \\operatorname{Var}(W_{ij}^{(l)} a_j^{(l-1)}) $$\nFor two independent random variables $U$ and $V$ with at least one having zero mean (e.g., $\\mathbb{E}[U]=0$), $\\operatorname{Var}(UV) = \\mathbb{E}[U^2V^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[UV])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[U^2]\\mathbb{E}[V^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[U]\\mathbb{E}[V])^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(U)\\operatorname{Var}(V)$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[W_{ij}^{(l)}] = 0$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(z_i^{(l)}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l-1}} \\operatorname{Var}(W_{ij}^{(l)}) \\operatorname{Var}(a_j^{(l-1)}) $$\nAssuming all weights in layer $l$ are drawn i.i.d. with variance $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)})$ and all activations from layer $l-1$ are i.i.d. with variance $\\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)})$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) = n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) \\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)}) $$\nwhere $n_{l-1}$ is the number of neurons in layer $l-1$. To maintain stable signal propagation, we require the variance to be preserved, i.e., $\\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})$. This requires a careful choice of the weight initialization variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)})$, to counteract the effect of the activation function $\\phi$ on the variance, which is captured by the term $\\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\phi(z^{(l-1)}))$.\n\n**Activation Function Analysis**\n\n1.  **$\\tanh$ Activation:** The hyperbolic tangent function, $\\tanh(z)$, is symmetric around the origin ($\\tanh(0)=0$) and behaves like the identity function for small inputs ($\\tanh(z) \\approx z$ for $z \\approx 0$). If we assume the pre-activations $z^{(l-1)}$ are concentrated around zero, which is a desirable state during initial training phases, then $\\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\tanh(z^{(l-1)})) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})$. Substituting this into our propagation equation yields:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) \\approx n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)}) $$\n    To achieve $\\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})$, we must set $n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = 1$.\n    **Xavier (Glorot) normal initialization** is designed precisely for this situation. It sets the variance of the weights $W^{(l)}$ drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ as:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = \\frac{2}{n_{l-1} + n_l} $$\n    In our specific problem, $n_{l-1} = n_l = n$, so this becomes $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = \\frac{2}{2n} = \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{n_{l-1}}$. This choice perfectly satisfies the condition $n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = 1$. Thus, Xavier initialization is expected to preserve variance for the $\\tanh$ activation function.\n\n2.  **$\\mathrm{ReLU}$ Activation:** The Rectified Linear Unit, $\\mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z)$, is not symmetric. For a zero-mean, symmetric input distribution for $z^{(l-1)}$ (like a Gaussian), exactly half of the inputs will be set to zero. This affects the variance. Let $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_z^2)$. The variance of the output $a = \\mathrm{ReLU}(z)$ is $\\operatorname{Var}(a) = \\mathbb{E}[a^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[a])^2$.\n    The expectation of the squared activation is $\\mathbb{E}[a^2] = \\mathbb{E}[\\max(0, z)^2] = \\int_0^\\infty z^2 p(z) dz$. Due to the symmetry of the normal distribution $p(z)$, this integral is half of the total integral for $z^2$: $\\mathbb{E}[a^2] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z^2 p(z) dz = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[z^2] = \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(z)$.\n    So, for $\\mathrm{ReLU}$, we have $\\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)}) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})$. The variance propagation equation becomes:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) \\approx n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})\\right) $$\n    To preserve variance, we must have $n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, which implies $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = \\frac{2}{n_{l-1}}$.\n    **He (Kaiming) normal initialization** is designed for this case. It sets the variance as:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = \\frac{2}{n_{l-1}} $$\n    This choice satisfies the condition exactly. Therefore, He initialization is expected to preserve variance for the $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation function. Mismatched pairs (e.g., $\\tanh$ with He, $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ with Xavier) are predicted to lead to exploding or vanishing variances, respectively.\n\n**Simulation Procedure**\n\nThe program will implement a Monte Carlo simulation for each of the $8$ test cases. For each case:\n1.  A pseudo-random number generator is seeded with the value $12345$ to ensure reproducibility.\n2.  An input data matrix $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{s \\times n}$ is generated, where each element is drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The empirical input variance, $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(x)$, is calculated using the provided formula.\n3.  The network is processed layer by layer, from $l=1$ to $L$. In each layer, the weight matrix $W^{(l)}$ is initialized from a zero-mean normal distribution with the variance dictated by the specified strategy (Xavier or He).\n4.  The pre-activations $z^{(l)} = a^{(l-1)} W^{(l)}$ are computed.\n5.  The empirical variance $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(z^{(l)})$ is computed. The relative deviation $\\delta^{(l)} = |\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(z^{(l)}) - \\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(x)| / \\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(x)$ is calculated.\n6.  The maximum relative deviation across all layers, $\\max_{1 \\le l \\le L} \\delta^{(l)}$, is tracked.\n7.  The post-activations $a^{(l)} = \\phi(z^{(l)})$ are computed to serve as input for the next layer.\n8.  After iterating through all layers, the test case is deemed to preserve variance if $\\max_{l} \\delta^{(l)} \\le \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon = 0.25$. This check will yield a boolean result for each case, which is then reported.",

The gradient $g^{(l-1)}$ is the vector whose $j$-th component is $g^{(l-1)}_j = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial h^{(l-1)}_j}$.\n$$\ng^{(l-1)}_j = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial z^{(l)}_k} \\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_k}{\\partial h^{(l-1)}_j}\n$$\nThe terms in the sum are:\n- $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial z^{(l)}_k} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial h^{(l)}_k} \\frac{\\partial h^{(l)}_k}{\\partial z^{(l)}_k} = g^{(l)}_k \\phi'(z^{(l)}_k)$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_k}{\\partial h^{(l-1)}_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h^{(l-1)}_j} \\sum_{m=1}^n W^{(l)}_{km} h^{(l-1)}_m = W^{(l)}_{kj}$.\n\nSubstituting these back gives the expression for a component of $g^{(l-1)}$:\n$$\ng^{(l-1)}_j = \\sum_{k=1}^n W^{(l)}_{kj} g^{(l)}_k \\phi'(z^{(l)}_k)\n$$\nWe need to find the expected squared Euclidean norm of this vector, $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2\\right]$.\n$$\n\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n (g^{(l-1)}_j)^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n W^{(l)}_{kj} g^{(l)}_k \\phi'(z^{(l)}_k) \\right)^2\n$$\nExpanding the square:\n$$\n\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n W^{(l)}_{kj} g^{(l)}_k \\phi'(z^{(l)}_k) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^n W^{(l)}_{mj} g^{(l)}_m \\phi'(z^{(l)}_m) \\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sum_{m=1}^n W^{(l)}_{kj} W^{(l)}_{mj} g^{(l)}_k g^{(l)}_m \\phi'(z^{(l)}_k) \\phi'(z^{(l)}_m)\n$$\nNow, we take the expectation. Due to the independence assumption (iv), the expectation of the product is the product of expectations.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2\\right] = \\sum_{j,k,m} \\mathbb{E}\\left[W^{(l)}_{kj} W^{(l)}_{mj}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[g^{(l)}_k g^{(l)}_m \\phi'(z^{(l)}_k) \\phi'(z^{(l)}_m)\\right]\n$$\nBased on the independence of $g^{(l)}$ and $z^{(l)}$ (a standard assumption in this context implied by (iv)), the second expectation term also separates:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2\\right] = \\sum_{j,k,m} \\mathbb{E}\\left[W^{(l)}_{kj} W^{(l)}_{mj}\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[g^{(l)}_k g^{(l)}_m\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\phi'(z^{(l)}_k) \\phi'(z^{(l)}_m)\\right]\n$$\nWe evaluate each expectation term using the given statistical properties:\n1.  **Weights**: $W^{(l)}_{ij}$ are i.i.d. with mean $0$ (i). Let $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}_{ij}) = \\sigma_W^2$.\n    $\\mathbb{E}\\left[W^{(l)}_{kj} W^{(l)}_{mj}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[W^{(l)}_{kj}] \\mathbb{E}[W^{(l)}_{mj}] = 0$ if $k \\neq m$.\n    $\\mathbb{E}\\left[(W^{(l)}_{kj})^2\\right] = \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}_{kj}) + (\\mathbb{E}[W^{(l)}_{kj}])^2 = \\sigma_W^2 + 0 = \\sigma_W^2$ if $k = m$.\n    This can be written as $\\mathbb{E}\\left[W^{(l)}_{kj} W^{(l)}_{mj}\\right] = \\sigma_W^2 \\delta_{km}$, where $\\delta_{km}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\n2.  **Gradients**: $g^{(l)}_k$ are i.i.d. with mean $0$ (iii). Let $\\operatorname{Var}(g^{(l)}_k) = \\sigma_{g,l}^2$.\n    A similar argument gives $\\mathbb{E}\\left[g^{(l)}_k g^{(l)}_m\\right] = \\sigma_{g,l}^2 \\delta_{km}$.\n\nThe term with $\\delta_{km}$ from the weights forces the sum over $m$ to collapse, setting $m=k$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n \\mathbb{E}\\left[(W^{(l)}_{kj})^2\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[(g^{(l)}_k)^2\\right] \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi'(z^{(l)}_k))^2\\right]\n$$\nSince all variables are i.i.d. over their respective indices, the expectations do not depend on $j$ or $k$.\n- $\\mathbb{E}\\left[(W^{(l)}_{kj})^2\\right] = \\sigma_W^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}_{ij})$.\n- $\\mathbb{E}\\left[(g^{(l)}_k)^2\\right] = \\sigma_{g,l}^2$. Note that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l)}\\|^2\\right] = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\mathbb{E}\\left[(g^{(l)}_k)^2\\right] = n\\sigma_{g,l}^2$.\n- $\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi'(z^{(l)}_k))^2\\right]$ is a constant for the layer, let's call it $\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right]$.\n\nSubstituting these into the sum:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sigma_W^2 \\sigma_{g,l}^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right] = n^2 \\sigma_W^2 \\sigma_{g,l}^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right]\n$$\nWe substitute $\\sigma_{g,l}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l)}\\|^2\\right]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2\\right] = n^2 \\sigma_W^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l)}\\|^2\\right]\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right] = \\left(n \\sigma_W^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right]\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l)}\\|^2\\right]\n$$\nThis gives the multiplicative factor $C = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l-1)}\\|^2\\right]}{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(l)}\\|^2\\right]} = n \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}_{ij}) \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right]$.\nApplying this recurrence relationship $L$ times from $l=L$ down to $l=1$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(0)}\\|^2\\right] = C \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(1)}\\|^2\\right] = \\dots = C^L \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(L)}\\|^2\\right]\n$$\nThe required ratio is $R = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(0)}\\|^{2}\\right]}{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|g^{(L)}\\|^{2}\\right]} = C^L = \\left(n \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}_{ij}) \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right]\\right)^L$.\n\nNow we must evaluate this for the four cases. First, we find $\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right]$ for each activation function.\n\n- **ReLU**: $\\phi(z) = \\max\\{0,z\\}$. The derivative is $\\phi'(z) = 1$ for $z>0$ and $0$ for $z<0$. Thus $(\\phi'(z))^2 = 1$ for $z>0$ and $0$ for $z<0$. The pre-activations $z^{(l)}$ are symmetric about zero (ii), so $P(z>0)=1/2$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right] = 1^2 \\cdot P(z>0) + 0^2 \\cdot P(z<0) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n- **tanh**: $\\phi(z) = \\tanh(z)$. The derivative is $\\phi'(z) = 1 - \\tanh^2(z)$. For this case, $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ (ii). We express the expectation as a Gaussian integral:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi')^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (1-\\tanh^2(z))^2 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right) dz\n$$\n\nWe can now compute $R$ for each of the four combinations.\n\n1.  **Xavier with ReLU**: $\\operatorname{Var}(W) = 1/n$, $\\mathbb{E}[(\\phi')^2] = 1/2$.\n    $C = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    $R = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^L$.\n\n2.  **He with ReLU**: $\\operatorname{Var}(W) = 2/n$, $\\mathbb{E}[(\\phi')^2] = 1/2$.\n    $C = n \\cdot \\frac{2}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\n    $R = (1)^L = 1$.\n\n3.  **Xavier with tanh**: $\\operatorname{Var}(W) = 1/n$, $\\mathbb{E}[(\\phi')^2] = \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right]$.\n    $C = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right]$.\n    $R = \\left(\\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right]\\right)^L$.\n\n4.  **He with tanh**: $\\operatorname{Var}(W) = 2/n$, $\\mathbb{E}[(\\phi')^2] = \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right]$.\n    $C = n \\cdot \\frac{2}{n} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right] = 2\\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right]$.\n    $R = \\left(2\\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)}\\left[(1-\\tanh^2(Z))^2\\right]\\right)^L$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix of these four results in order.",
