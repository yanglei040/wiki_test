            "problem": "You are asked to demonstrate, from first principles, how the two-dimensional ($2\\mathrm{D}$) discrete convolution used in deep learning can be understood as sliding dot products, and to validate a naive implementation against a trusted numerical library. Begin from the fundamental definition of discrete convolution on finite arrays, and treat the image as a real-valued matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W}$ and the kernel as a real-valued matrix $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{R \\times S}$. Use the following constraints to ensure scientific realism and clarity: perform the convolution in the “valid” configuration (no padding, stride $1$, no dilation), reverse the kernel across both axes before sliding, and do not assume any optimizations or specialized hardware.\n\nYour program must implement the operation as sliding dot products computed by naive loops: for each spatial location, take the corresponding submatrix of $X$ of size $R \\times S$, reverse $K$ across both axes, and compute the scalar product between the two. Independently, compute the same result using Scientific Python (SciPy) to serve as an implementation oracle, and verify equality within a specified numerical tolerance. Then aggregate the verification outcomes across a set of test cases.\n\nUse the following test suite, which covers a general case, boundary cases, rectangular kernels, identity-like behavior, and mixed-sign floating-point values.

Express the numerical tolerance as the decimal $10^{-12}$ and ensure that all comparisons strictly adhere to this tolerance. The final output type for each test case is a boolean, and the aggregate output is a list of booleans on a single line.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a demonstration of two-dimensional ($2\\mathrm{D}$) discrete convolution as a series of sliding dot products, implemented from first principles and validated against a standard library function.\n\nThe fundamental operation is the $2\\mathrm{D}$ discrete convolution of a real-valued matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W}$ (the image) with a real-valued matrix $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{R \\times S}$ (the kernel). Let the output matrix be $Y$. For the \"valid\" convolution mode, with a stride of $1$ and no padding, the dimensions of the output matrix $Y$ are $(H - R + 1) \\times (W - S + 1)$.\n\nThe value of the output $Y$ at each location $(m, n)$ is defined by the convolution sum:\n$$\nY(m, n) = (X * K)(m, n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{R-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{S-1} X(m+i, n+j) \\cdot K(R-1-i, S-1-j)\n$$\nThis formula is applicable for output indices $m$ and $n$ such that $0 \\le m \\le H-R$ and $0 \\le n \\le W-S$. The expression $K(R-1-i, S-1-j)$ represents the kernel $K$ flipped (or reversed) along both its horizontal and vertical axes.\n\nLet us define the reversed kernel $K_r$ as:\n$$\nK_r(i, j) = K(R-1-i, S-1-j)\n$$\nWith this definition, the convolution formula simplifies to:\n$$\nY(m, n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{R-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{S-1} X(m+i, n+j) \\cdot K_r(i, j)\n$$\nThis form reveals the \"sliding dot product\" interpretation. Let $X_{m,n}$ denote the submatrix of $X$ of size $R \\times S$ whose top-left corner is at position $(m, n)$. The elements of this submatrix are $X_{m,n}(i, j) = X(m+i, n+j)$. The expression for $Y(m,n)$ is then the sum of the element-wise products of the submatrix $X_{m,n}$ and the reversed kernel $K_r$. This operation is equivalent to the Frobenius inner product of the two matrices:\n$$\nY(m, n) = \\langle X_{m,n}, K_r \\rangle_F\n$$\nConceptually, the reversed kernel $K_r$ slides across the image $X$. At each position $(m, n)$, the dot product between the kernel and the underlying image patch is calculated, and the result becomes the corresponding entry in the output matrix $Y$.\n\nThe implementation will proceed in three steps for each test case:\n1.  **Naive Implementation**: A function will be created to implement the sliding dot product from first principles. This function will first explicitly reverse the kernel $K$ to get $K_r$. Then, it will iterate through all valid top-left positions $(m, n)$ in the image $X$. For each position, it will extract the $R \\times S$ submatrix $X_{m,n}$, compute the element-wise product with $K_r$, and sum the results to produce the output value $Y(m, n)$.\n\n2.  **Library Implementation**: The `scipy.signal.convolve2d` function with the `mode='valid'` parameter will be used as an oracle. This function is a highly optimized and trusted implementation of the $2\\mathrm{D}$ convolution operation. By definition, it performs the kernel reversal internally before computing the sliding sum of products. Therefore, its output should be mathematically identical to the result of our naive implementation.\n\n3.  **Verification**: The numerical results from both implementations will be compared. The `numpy.allclose` function is suitable for this, as it performs an element-wise comparison of two arrays within a specified tolerance. As required, both the relative tolerance (`rtol`) and absolute tolerance (`atol`) will be set to $10^{-12}$. For each test case, the function will return `True` if the arrays are equal within this tolerance and `False` otherwise. The boolean results from all test cases will be collected and presented in the specified format.",

            "problem": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layer applies a two-dimensional convolution by sliding a spatial kernel across an input feature map and reusing the same kernel weights at every spatial location. Consider an input tensor with spatial dimensions $H \\times W = 56 \\times 56$ and $C_{\\text{in}} = 64$ channels. You apply a convolutional layer with a square kernel of spatial size $k \\times k$ where $k=3$, stride $s=1$, zero padding $p=1$ (so the output spatial size is preserved), and $C_{\\text{out}} = 128$ output channels. Assume an additive bias is included for each output channel in the convolutional layer.\n\nNow define a hypothetical alternative layer that produces the same output shape by, at each output spatial location, taking the corresponding $k \\times k \\times C_{\\text{in}}$ input patch, flattening it, and applying a fully connected (affine) transformation to $C_{\\text{out}}$ outputs.

The final answer must be a single real number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a comparison of the number of trainable parameters in two types of neural network layers: a standard 2D convolutional layer and a hypothetical locally connected layer without weight sharing. We will derive the parameter count for each and then compute their ratio.\n\n### 1. Parameters in a Standard Convolutional Layer\n\nA standard convolutional layer reuses the same set of filters across all spatial locations. Let the number of input channels be $C_{\\text{in}}$, the number of output channels be $C_{\\text{out}}$, and the kernel size be $k \\times k$.\n\n-   **Weights:** To produce one output feature map, a single filter is convolved over the input. This filter must have a depth equal to the number of input channels, $C_{\\text{in}}$. Thus, its size is $k \\times k \\times C_{\\text{in}}$. Since we need to generate $C_{\\text{out}}$ output feature maps, we need $C_{\\text{out}}$ such filters. The total number of weights is the product of these terms:\n    $$ N_{\\text{weights, conv}} = k^2 \\cdot C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot C_{\\text{out}} $$\n-   **Biases:** Typically, one bias term is added per output feature map. Since there are $C_{\\text{out}}$ output maps, there are $C_{\\text{out}}$ biases.\n    $$ N_{\\text{biases, conv}} = C_{\\text{out}} $$\n-   **Total Parameters:** The total number of trainable parameters, $N_{\\text{conv}}$, is the sum of weights and biases:\n    $$ N_{\\text{conv}} = (k^2 \\cdot C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot C_{\\text{out}}) + C_{\\text{out}} $$\n\n### 2. Parameters in a Locally Connected Layer (No Sharing)\n\nThis layer applies an independent transformation at each spatial location of the output map. First, we determine the number of output locations. The output spatial dimensions, $H_{\\text{out}} \\times W_{\\text{out}}$, are given by the formula:\n$$ H_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{H - k + 2p}{s} + 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad W_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{W - k + 2p}{s} + 1 $$\nGiven $H=56, W=56, k=3, p=1, s=1$, the output dimensions are:\n$$ H_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{56 - 3 + 2(1)}{1} + 1 = 56 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad W_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{56 - 3 + 2(1)}{1} + 1 = 56 $$\nSo there are $56 \\times 56 = 3136$ output locations.\n\nAt each location, the transformation is from an input patch of size $k \\times k \\times C_{\\text{in}}$ to $C_{\\text{out}}$ output values. This is equivalent to a fully connected layer.\n\n-   **Parameters per location:** The number of weights for this local transformation is $(k \\times k \\times C_{\\text{in}}) \\times C_{\\text{out}}$, and the number of biases is $C_{\\text{out}}$.\n    $$ N_{\\text{per location}} = (k^2 \\cdot C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot C_{\\text{out}}) + C_{\\text{out}} $$\n-   **Total Parameters:** Since there is no weight sharing, we multiply the parameters per location by the total number of output locations:\n    $$ N_{\\text{no-share}} = (H_{\\text{out}} \\cdot W_{\\text{out}}) \\times N_{\\text{per location}} $$\n    $$ N_{\\text{no-share}} = (H_{\\text{out}} \\cdot W_{\\text{out}}) \\cdot \\left( (k^2 \\cdot C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot C_{\\text{out}}) + C_{\\text{out}} \\right) $$\n\n### 3. Parameter Savings Factor (S)\n\nThe savings factor $S$ is the ratio of the parameters in the no-sharing layer to the convolutional layer.\n$$ S = \\frac{N_{\\text{no-share}}}{N_{\\text{conv}}} = \\frac{(H_{\\text{out}} \\cdot W_{\\text{out}}) \\cdot \\left( (k^2 \\cdot C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot C_{\\text{out}}) + C_{\\text{out}} \\right)}{(k^2 \\cdot C_{\\text{in}} \\cdot C_{\\text{out}}) + C_{\\text{out}}} $$\nThe term for parameters per location cancels out, leaving:\n$$ S = H_{\\text{out}} \\cdot W_{\\text{out}} $$\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nUsing the calculated output dimensions:\n$$ S = 56 \\times 56 = 3136 $$\nThis shows that the convolutional layer is more than 3000 times more parameter-efficient than its locally connected counterpart for this configuration, highlighting the profound impact of parameter sharing.",

It is scientifically grounded in discrete mathematics and probability theory, directly relevant to the study of convolutional networks, and is well-posed, self-contained, and objective. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the performance of two families of models on a binary image task. The target variable $t[i,j]$ for a position $(i,j)$ is the parity of the sum of pixels in the $2 \\times 2$ block starting at that position. The input pixels $x[i,j]$ are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p=\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\n### Analysis of Model Family A (Pointwise-Only)\n\nModels in Family A are composed exclusively of $1 \\times 1$ convolutions and pointwise nonlinearities. A $1 \\times 1$ convolution computes an output at spatial location $(i,j)$ that is a function of only the input at the same location, $x[i,j]$.

Let $S_{i, j} = x[i,j+1] + x[i+1,j] + x[i+1,j+1]$. The target is then $t[i,j] = (x[i,j] + S_{i, j}) \\bmod 2$.\n\nThe input pixels $x[i',j']$ are independent Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p=\\tfrac{1}{2}$. That is, $P(x[i',j']=0) = P(x[i',j']=1) = \\tfrac{1}{2}$. The sum of any number of i.i.d. Bernoulli($\\tfrac{1}{2}$) variables, taken modulo $2$, results in a new Bernoulli($\\tfrac{1}{2}$) variable. Since $S_{i,j}$ is the sum of $3$ such variables, $S_{i,j} \\bmod 2$ is a random variable that takes values $0$ and $1$ with equal probability, i.e., $P(S_{i,j} \\bmod 2 = 0) = P(S_{i,j} \\bmod 2 = 1) = \\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\nCrucially, the pixels composing $S_{i,j}$ are distinct from $x[i,j]$, so $S_{i,j}$ is statistically independent of $x[i,j]$. The model $f$ bases its prediction only on $x[i,j]$, which provides no information about the value of $S_{i, j} \\bmod 2$.\n\nThe accuracy of the model is the probability of a correct prediction, $P(\\hat{t}[i,j] = t[i,j])$. We can find the maximum possible accuracy by considering the optimal choices for $f(0)$ and $f(1)$.\n$$ Acc = P(f(x[i,j]) = (x[i,j] + S_{i,j}) \\bmod 2) $$\nBy the law of total probability, conditioning on the value of $x[i,j]$:\n$$ Acc = P(\\hat{t}=t | x[i,j]=0)P(x[i,j]=0) + P(\\hat{t}=t | x[i,j]=1)P(x[i,j]=1) $$\n$$ Acc = \\frac{1}{2} P(f(0) = (0 + S_{i,j}) \\bmod 2) + \\frac{1}{2} P(f(1) = (1 + S_{i,j}) \\bmod 2) $$\nThe first term is $P(f(0) = S_{i,j} \\bmod 2)$. Since $S_{i,j} \\bmod 2$ is a fair coin flip, regardless of whether $f(0)$ is chosen to be $0$ or $1$, the probability of matching is $\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\nThe second term is $P(f(1) = (1 + S_{i,j}) \\bmod 2)$. The variable $(1 + S_{i,j}) \\bmod 2$ is also a fair coin flip, so the probability of matching it is also $\\tfrac{1}{2}$, regardless of the choice of $f(1)$.\n\nThus, the maximum achievable accuracy is:\n$$ Acc_{max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis constitutes a tight upper bound, as it is achieved by any constant predictor, for example $f(x)=0$ for all $x$, which has an accuracy of $P(t[i,j]=0) = \\tfrac{1}{2}$. The provable tight upper bound on accuracy for Family A is $0.5$.\n\n### Analysis of Model Family B (Neighborhood-Aware)\n\nModels in Family B are permitted to use two-dimensional convolutions with spatial support covering each $2 \\times 2$ block. We can construct a model that perfectly computes the target function.\n\nThe target function is $t[i,j] = \\left( \\sum_{u=0}^{1} \\sum_{v=0}^{1} x[i+u, j+v] \\right) \\bmod 2$.\nThis computation can be decomposed into two steps, both of which are permitted for Family B:\n1.  A linear spatial aggregation: Compute the sum $y[i,j] = \\sum_{u=0}^{1} \\sum_{v=0}^{1} x[i+u,j+v]$. This is a 2D cross-correlation with a $2 \\times 2$ kernel of all ones, $k = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Cross-correlation is a standard operation in deep learning libraries, often referred to as \"convolution,\" and fits the problem's description of a convolution with spatial support. This operation, with `'valid'` padding, produces an output of shape $(H-1) \\times (W-1)$.\n2.  A pointwise nonlinearity: Apply the function $g(z) = z \\bmod 2$ to each element of the intermediate feature map $y$.\n\nThe resulting model, $\\hat{t}[i,j] = g(y[i,j])$, is mathematically identical to the definition of the target $t[i,j]$. Therefore, this construction is a perfect predictor. When evaluated on any dataset generated according to the problem's specifications, the number of correct predictions will be equal to the total number of valid positions. The empirical accuracy will be exactly $1.0$.\n\nThe program below will implement this perfect model for Family B and compute its empirical accuracy, which is expected to be $1.0$. It will also report the derived theoretical bound of $0.5$ for Family A.",
