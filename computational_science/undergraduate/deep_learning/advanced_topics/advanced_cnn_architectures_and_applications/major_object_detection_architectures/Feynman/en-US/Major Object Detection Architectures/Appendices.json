            "problem": "A Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) uses a fixed set of anchor boxes at each feature map level to propose candidate detections. At a given level, suppose we must choose $K$ anchor shapes (width $w$ and height $h$) per spatial location. Anchors are matched to ground-truth boxes by Intersection-over-Union (IoU) thresholding: an anchor is considered a match for a ground-truth object if its IoU with that object is at least a threshold $\\tau$, where IoU for same-centered rectangles is defined by the ratio of intersection area to union area. Recall is defined as the fraction of ground-truth boxes that have at least one matched anchor.\n\nWe construct anchor shapes per level by running $k$-means clustering on the set of ground-truth box shapes projected to that level, using $(\\log w, \\log h)$ as features. Consider two choices of clustering dissimilarity:\n- Choice $1$: Euclidean distance in $(\\log w, \\log h)$, that is $d_{E}((w,h),(w',h')) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\log w - \\log w'\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\log h - \\log h'\\right)^{2}}$.\n- Choice $2$: IoU-based dissimilarity for same-centered boxes, that is $d_{I}((w,h),(w',h')) = 1 - \\mathrm{IoU}((w,h),(w',h'))$.\n\nAssume the following stylized small-object distribution on a finest SSD level (small stride): two equally likely modes of small boxes, with mode $\\mathcal{A}$ having shape $(w,h) = (20,5)$ and mode $\\mathcal{B}$ having shape $(w,h) = (5,20)$ (pixel units). The IoU threshold is $\\tau = 0.5$. For the purpose of reasoning, assume same-centered anchors and ground-truth boxes at this level.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and the geometric consequences of the above dissimilarities, reason about how the choice of clustering objective impacts the recall of small objects as $K$ varies. Which statement best captures the behavior?\n\nA. For small $K$, IoU-based clustering (Choice $2$) tends to yield higher small-object recall than Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$), because the objective aligns directly with IoU-based matching; recall is non-decreasing in $K$ for both objectives, and the recall gap narrows as $K$ increases.\n\nB. For small $K$, Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$) yields higher small-object recall than IoU-based clustering (Choice $2$), since logarithms favor small sizes; moreover, increasing $K$ decreases recall due to overfitting anchors to modes.\n\nC. The recall of small objects is independent of $K$, and both clustering objectives achieve the same recall for any $K$ because SSD is multi-level.\n\nD. Choosing Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$) makes increasing $K$ unnecessary, because the logarithm guarantees IoU above the threshold $\\tau$ for all small objects regardless of anchor shape.",
            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Model**: Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)\n- **Anchor Generation**: A fixed set of $K$ anchor shapes (width $w$, height $h$) are chosen per spatial location at each feature map level. The shapes are determined by running $k$-means clustering on the set of ground-truth box shapes projected to that level.\n- **Clustering Features**: The features used for clustering are $(\\log w, \\log h)$.\n- **Matching Criterion**: An anchor is a match for a ground-truth object if their Intersection-over-Union (IoU) is at least a threshold $\\tau$.\n- **IoU Definition**: For same-centered rectangles, IoU is the ratio of intersection area to union area.\n- **Recall Definition**: The fraction of ground-truth boxes that have at least one matched anchor.\n- **Clustering Dissimilarity Choices**:\n  - Choice $1$: Euclidean distance, $d_{E}((w,h),(w',h')) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\log w - \\log w'\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\log h - \\log h'\\right)^{2}}$.\n  - Choice $2$: IoU-based dissimilarity, $d_{I}((w,h),(w',h')) = 1 - \\mathrm{IoU}((w,h),(w',h'))$.\n- **Specific Scenario**:\n  - A single, finest SSD level is considered.\n  - The ground-truth box distribution consists of two equally likely modes:\n    - Mode $\\mathcal{A}$: shape $(w,h) = (20,5)$.\n    - Mode $\\mathcal{B}$: shape $(w,h) = (5,20)$.\n  - The IoU threshold is $\\tau = 0.5$.\n  - An explicit assumption is made of \"same-centered anchors and ground-truth boxes\".\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the well-established field of deep learning for object detection. The concepts of SSD, anchor boxes, IoU, recall, and $k$-means clustering for anchor generation are standard components of modern object detection literature (e.g., in YOLOv2 and subsequent works). Both dissimilarity metrics are plausible choices for clustering. The problem is a valid, stylized exercise in understanding the model's behavior.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific, albeit simplified, scenario and asks for a qualitative comparison of two methods. The assumptions (e.g., same-centered boxes) are stated clearly and render the problem analyzable. A unique line of reasoning can be followed to deduce the behavior of the system under the given conditions.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. All terms are either standard in the field or explicitly defined. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The analysis can proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare how two different clustering objectives for generating anchor boxes affect recall on a specific bimodal distribution of ground-truth (GT) boxes. Recall is achieved for a GT box if its IoU with at least one of the $K$ anchor boxes is $\\ge 0.5$. The anchor boxes are the centroids found by $k$-means. We will analyze the cases for small $K$ and the trend as $K$ increases.\n\nThe IoU for two same-centered boxes with dimensions $(w_1, h_1)$ and $(w_2, h_2)$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{\\text{Area(Intersection)}}{\\text{Area(Union)}} = \\frac{\\min(w_1, w_2) \\cdot \\min(h_1, h_2)}{w_1 h_1 + w_2 h_2 - \\min(w_1, w_2) \\cdot \\min(h_1, h_2)} $$\n\nThe two GT box modes are $\\mathcal{A}: (w_A, h_A) = (20, 5)$ and $\\mathcal{B}: (w_B, h_B) = (5, 20)$. The IoU threshold is $\\tau = 0.5$.\n\n### Analysis for $K=1$\nFor $K=1$, we seek a single anchor box (cluster centroid) that best represents the entire distribution.\n\n**Choice 1: Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ space.**\nThe $k$-means algorithm with $K=1$ will find the mean of the data points. The data points in the feature space are $(\\log 20, \\log 5)$ and $(\\log 5, \\log 20)$. Since the modes are equally likely, the centroid $(\\log w_{\\text{anchor}}, \\log h_{\\text{anchor}})$ is the average:\n$$ \\log w_{\\text{anchor}} = \\frac{\\log 20 + \\log 5}{2} = \\frac{\\log(20 \\cdot 5)}{2} = \\frac{\\log 100}{2} = \\log(10) $$\n$$ \\log h_{\\text{anchor}} = \\frac{\\log 5 + \\log 20}{2} = \\frac{\\log(5 \\cdot 20)}{2} = \\frac{\\log 100}{2} = \\log(10) $$\nThis corresponds to an anchor box shape of $(w_{\\text{anchor}}, h_{\\text{anchor}}) = (10, 10)$. This is the geometric mean of the component dimensions.\n\nNow, we calculate the IoU of this $(10, 10)$ anchor with the two GT modes:\n- IoU with Mode $\\mathcal{A}$ $(20, 5)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{IoU}((10,10), (20,5)) = \\frac{\\min(10,20) \\cdot \\min(10,5)}{10 \\cdot 10 + 20 \\cdot 5 - \\min(10,20) \\cdot \\min(10,5)} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 5}{100 + 100 - 50} = \\frac{50}{150} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n- By symmetry, the IoU with Mode $\\mathcal{B}$ $(5, 20)$ is also $1/3$.\n\nSince $\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333 < \\tau = 0.5$, this anchor box fails to match any GT box from either mode. Therefore, the recall for Choice $1$ with $K=1$ is $0\\%$.\n\n**Choice 2: IoU-based clustering.**\nThe objective of $k$-means with dissimilarity $1 - \\mathrm{IoU}$ is to find a centroid that maximizes the average IoU with the data points in its cluster. For $K=1$, we seek a single anchor $(w, h)$ that maximizes the sum of IoUs with both modes (since they are equally likely): $\\mathrm{IoU}((w,h), (20,5)) + \\mathrm{IoU}((w,h), (5,20))$. The anchor $(10,10)$ from Choice $1$ gives a total IoU sum of $1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3$.\n\nHowever, consider choosing one of the modes as the anchor, e.g., $(w_{\\text{anchor}}, h_{\\text{anchor}}) = (20, 5)$.\n- IoU with Mode $\\mathcal{A}$ $(20, 5)$: $\\mathrm{IoU}((20,5), (20,5)) = 1.0$.\n- IoU with Mode $\\mathcal{B}$ $(5, 20)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{IoU}((20,5), (5,20)) = \\frac{\\min(20,5) \\cdot \\min(5,20)}{20 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\cdot 20 - \\min(20,5) \\cdot \\min(5,20)} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{100 + 100 - 25} = \\frac{25}{175} = \\frac{1}{7} $$\nThe total IoU sum is $1 + 1/7 = 8/7 \\approx 1.14$. Since $8/7 > 2/3$, an anchor shape that perfectly matches one mode is a better centroid under this objective than the \"average\" anchor from Choice $1$. A $k$-means procedure would converge to one of the two modes (or a shape very close to one of them). Assuming the anchor is $(20,5)$:\n- GT boxes of Mode $\\mathcal{A}$ are matched, as their IoU is $1.0 \\ge 0.5$.\n- GT boxes of Mode $\\mathcal{B}$ are not matched, as their IoU is $1/7 \\approx 0.14 < 0.5$.\nSince the modes are equally likely, $50\\%$ of the GT boxes are matched. The recall for Choice $2$ with $K=1$ is $50\\%$.\n\n### Analysis for $K \\ge 2$\nFor $K=2$, we seek two anchors. Given the two distinct modes, any reasonable clustering algorithm should dedicate one cluster center to each mode.\n- **Choice 1**: The two points in log-space are $(\\log 20, \\log 5)$ and $(\\log 5, \\log 20)$. For $K=2$, $k$-means will place one centroid at each point. The resulting anchors will be $(20,5)$ and $(5,20)$.\n- **Choice 2**: The IoU-based clustering will also find that the optimal two centroids are the modes themselves, as this arrangement maximizes the intra-cluster IoU perfectly (average IoU of $1.0$ in each cluster). The anchors will be $(20,5)$ and $(5,20)$.\n\nWith these two anchors, any GT box of Mode $\\mathcal{A}$ will have an IoU of $1.0$ with the $(20,5)$ anchor, and any GT box of Mode $\\mathcal{B}$ will have an IoU of $1.0$ with the $(5,20)$ anchor. In both cases, the IoU exceeds the threshold $\\tau=0.5$. Thus, for $K=2$, both methods achieve $100\\%$ recall.\n\n### General Behavior\n1.  **Small $K$**: For $K=1$, Choice $2$ (IoU-based) yields a much higher recall ($50\\%$) than Choice $1$ ($0\\%$). This is because the objective of Choice $2$ is directly aligned with the final evaluation goal (high IoU), whereas the Euclidean distance in log-space is only a proxy which fails in this specific case.\n2.  **Increasing $K$**: Recall is a non-decreasing function of $K$. Adding more diverse anchors can only cover more GT boxes or maintain the current coverage; it can never reduce it.\n3.  **Gap Narrowing**: The recall gap between Choice $2$ and Choice $1$ is $50\\%$ for $K=1$. For $K \\ge 2$, the gap is $0\\%$ as both achieve $100\\%$ recall. The gap narrows and disappears as $K$ increases sufficiently to cover all modes in the data.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For small $K$, IoU-based clustering (Choice $2$) tends to yield higher small-object recall than Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$), because the objective aligns directly with IoU-based matching; recall is non-decreasing in $K$ for both objectives, and the recall gap narrows as $K$ increases.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n- For small $K$ (e.g., $K=1$), Choice $2$ recall ($50\\%$) is higher than Choice $1$ recall ($0\\%$).\n- The reason provided (direct alignment of objective) is correct.\n- Recall is non-decreasing in $K$.\n- The recall gap narrows as $K$ increases (from $50\\%$ at $K=1$ to $0\\%$ at $K=2$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For small $K$, Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$) yields higher small-object recall than IoU-based clustering (Choice $2$), since logarithms favor small sizes; moreover, increasing $K$ decreases recall due to overfitting anchors to modes.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds.\n- The first clause is factually wrong; our analysis showed Choice $1$ yields lower recall for $K=1$.\n- The claim that increasing $K$ decreases recall is fundamentally incorrect. Recall is non-decreasing in the number of anchors. \"Overfitting\" to modes is precisely what is desired to maximize recall.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The recall of small objects is independent of $K$, and both clustering objectives achieve the same recall for any $K$ because SSD is multi-level.**\nThis statement is incorrect.\n- Recall is not independent of $K$; for Choice $1$, it went from $0\\%$ to $100\\%$ as $K$ went from $1$ to $2$.\n- The objectives do not achieve the same recall for any $K$; they differ at $K=1$.\n- The mention of SSD being multi-level is irrelevant to the specific question which is constrained to a single level.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Choosing Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$) makes increasing $K$ unnecessary, because the logarithm guarantees IoU above the threshold $\\tau$ for all small objects regardless of anchor shape.**\nThis statement is nonsensical.\n- Increasing $K$ from $1$ to $2$ was absolutely necessary for Choice $1$ to achieve any recall.\n- The use of a logarithm in feature space provides no guarantee whatsoever on the resulting IoU values, which demonstrably depend on the anchor shape. Our calculation for $K=1$ yielded an IoU of $1/3$, which is below the threshold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

We will derive each gradient separately and then compute the limit of their ratio.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the linear-width regression case.\nThe loss function is given by $L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,(\\hat{w} - w_{g})^{2}$.\nIn this parameterization, the network's output $u$ is the predicted width itself, so $\\hat{w} = u$.\nSubstituting this into the loss function, we get:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{lin}}(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,(u - w_{g})^{2}\n$$\nTo find the gradient with respect to $u$, we differentiate $L_{\\mathrm{lin}}(u)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{lin}}}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\,(u - w_{g})^{2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot (u - w_{g}) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(u - w_g) = u - w_{g}\n$$\nThe problem states that the prediction has a fixed multiplicative error relative to the ground truth, given by $\\hat{w} = r\\,w_{g}$, where $r \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and $r \\neq 1$.\nSince $\\hat{w} = u$ for the linear case, we have $u = r\\,w_{g}$.\nSubstituting this expression for $u$ into our gradient, we obtain the gradient as a function of $w_g$ and $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{lin}}}{\\partial u} = r\\,w_{g} - w_{g} = (r-1)w_{g}\n$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the log-space width regression case.\nThe loss function is given by $L_{\\log}(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,(u - t)^{2}$.\nThe gradient with respect to $u$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L_{\\log}}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\,(u - t)^{2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot (u - t) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(u - t) = u - t\n$$\nHere, $u$ and $t$ are defined in logarithmic space.

Since $r > 0$ and $r \\neq 1$, $\\ln(r)$ is a non-zero real number.\n\nNow we can form the ratio $R(w_g)$:\n$$\nR(w_{g}) = \\frac{\\left|\\frac{\\partial L_{\\mathrm{lin}}}{\\partial u}\\right|}{\\left|\\frac{\\partial L_{\\log}}{\\partial u}\\right|} = \\frac{|(r-1)w_{g}|}{|\\ln(r)|}\n$$\nSince $w_g \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, we have $|w_g| = w_g$. This allows us to write:\n$$\nR(w_{g}) = \\frac{|r-1| \\cdot w_{g}}{|\\ln(r)|}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $r$ is a fixed constant. Therefore, the term $\\frac{|r-1|}{|\\ln(r)|}$ is a positive constant value (since $r \\neq 1$). Let's denote this constant by $C = \\frac{|r-1|}{|\\ln(r)|}$.\nThe ratio is then $R(w_{g}) = C \\cdot w_{g}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the required limit as $w_g$ approaches $0$ from the positive side:\n$$\n\\lim_{w_{g} \\to 0^{+}} R(w_{g}) = \\lim_{w_{g} \\to 0^{+}} \\left( C \\cdot w_{g} \\right)\n$$\nSince $C$ is a finite constant, the limit is:\n$$\n\\lim_{w_{g} \\to 0^{+}} C \\cdot w_{g} = C \\cdot \\lim_{w_{g} \\to 0^{+}} w_{g} = C \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe result indicates that for very small objects (as $w_g \\to 0^{+}$), the gradient from the linear-width regression becomes vanishingly small compared to the gradient from the log-space regression, which remains constant.

Its area is $A_{gt} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe predicted box, $B_p$, has the same dimensions and is translated by $(d, d)$. Its center is at $(d, d)$, and it spans the region $[d-\\frac{1}{2}, d+\\frac{1}{2}] \\times [d-\\frac{1}{2}, d+\\frac{1}{2}]$. Its area is $A_p = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe intersection of these two boxes, $I = B_{gt} \\cap B_p$, is a rectangle. The overlapping region in the $x$-dimension is $[\\max(-\\frac{1}{2}, d-\\frac{1}{2}), \\min(\\frac{1}{2}, d+\\frac{1}{2})]$. Since $0 < d < 1$, this simplifies to $[d-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$. The width of the intersection is $w_I = \\frac{1}{2} - (d-\\frac{1}{2}) = 1-d$.\nSimilarly, the height of the intersection is $h_I = 1-d$.\nThe area of intersection is $A_I = (1-d)^2$.\n\nThe union of the two boxes, $U = B_{gt} \\cup B_p$, has an area given by $A_U = A_{gt} + A_p - A_I$.\n$$A_U = 1 + 1 - (1-d)^2 = 2 - (1-d)^2$$\n\nThe Intersection over Union (IoU) is defined as $\\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{A_I}{A_U}$.\n$$\\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{(1-d)^2}{2 - (1-d)^2}$$\nThe problem states that $\\mathrm{IoU} = 0.5$. We use this to solve for $d$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{(1-d)^2}{2 - (1-d)^2} $$\n$$ 2 - (1-d)^2 = 2(1-d)^2 $$\n$$ 2 = 3(1-d)^2 $$\n$$ (1-d)^2 = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nSince $0 < d < 1$, we have $1-d > 0$. Taking the positive square root:\n$$ 1-d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\n$$ d = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nThis value of $d$ satisfies the condition $0 < d < 1$, as $\\sqrt{2/3} \\approx 0.816$, so $d \\approx 0.184$.\n\n#### Calculation of Losses\nWe now calculate the value of each loss function for this specific configuration.\n\n1.  **IoU Loss ($L_{\\mathrm{IoU}}$)**\n    The IoU loss is defined as $L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} = 1 - \\mathrm{IoU}$. Given that $\\mathrm{IoU} = 0.5$:\n    $$ L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 $$\n\n2.  **Generalized IoU Loss ($L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}}$)**\n    The GIoU loss is defined as $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} = 1 - \\mathrm{GIoU} = 1 - \\left(\\mathrm{IoU} - \\frac{A_C - A_U}{A_C}\\right) = L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} + \\frac{A_C - A_U}{A_C}$, where $C$ is the smallest convex bounding box enclosing both $B_{gt}$ and $B_p$, and $A_C$ is its area.\n\n    The minimal $x$-coordinate is $-\\frac{1}{2}$ (from $B_{gt}$) and the maximal is $d+\\frac{1}{2}$ (from $B_p$).\n    The minimal $y$-coordinate is $-\\frac{1}{2}$ (from $B_{gt}$) and the maximal is $d+\\frac{1}{2}$ (from $B_p$).\n    The width of $C$ is $w_C = (d+\\frac{1}{2}) - (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 1+d$.\n    The height of $C$ is $h_C = (d+\\frac{1}{2}) - (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 1+d$.\n    The area of $C$ is $A_C = (1+d)^2$.\n\n    The penalty term is $\\frac{A_C - A_U}{A_C}$.\n    $A_C - A_U = (1+d)^2 - [2 - (1-d)^2] = (1+2d+d^2) - [2-(1-2d+d^2)] = 1+2d+d^2-2+1-2d+d^2 = 2d^2$.\n    The penalty is $\\frac{2d^2}{(1+d)^2}$.\n    $$ L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} + \\frac{2d^2}{(1+d)^2} = 0.5 + 2\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\n\n3.  **Distance IoU Loss ($L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}}$)**\n    The DIoU loss is defined as $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} + \\frac{\\rho^2(b_{gt}, b_p)}{c^2}$, where $\\rho(b_{gt}, b_p)$ is the Euclidean distance between the box centers, and $c$ is the diagonal length of the enclosing box $C$.\n\n    The center of $B_{gt}$ is $b_{gt}=(0,0)$. The center of $B_p$ is $b_p=(d,d)$.\n    The squared distance between centers is $\\rho^2 = (d-0)^2 + (d-0)^2 = 2d^2$.\n    The squared diagonal length of $C$ is $c^2 = w_C^2 + h_C^2 = (1+d)^2 + (1+d)^2 = 2(1+d)^2$.\n\n    The penalty term is $\\frac{2d^2}{2(1+d)^2} = \\frac{d^2}{(1+d)^2}$.\n    $$ L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} + \\frac{d^2}{(1+d)^2} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\n\n4.  **Complete IoU Loss ($L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}}$)**\n    The CIoU loss adds an additional penalty for aspect ratio consistency: $L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} + \\alpha v$.\n    The term $v$ measures the consistency of aspect ratio: $v = \\frac{4}{\\pi^2}\\left(\\arctan\\frac{w_{gt}}{h_{gt}} - \\arctan\\frac{w_p}{h_p}\\right)^2$.\n    In this problem, both boxes are squares with width $w=1$ and height $h=1$.\n    $w_{gt}=1, h_{gt}=1 \\implies \\arctan\\frac{w_{gt}}{h_{gt}} = \\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n    $w_{p}=1, h_{p}=1 \\implies \\arctan\\frac{w_{p}}{h_{p}} = \\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n    Therefore, $v = \\frac{4}{\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)^2 = 0$.\n    Since $v=0$, the additional penalty term $\\alpha v = 0$.\n    $$ L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\n\n#### Comparison\nWe have the following expressions for the four losses:\n-   $L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} = 0.5$\n-   $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} = 0.5 + 2\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$\n-   $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$\n-   $L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$\n\nWe found $d = 1 - \\sqrt{2/3}$. Since $0 < \\sqrt{2/3} < 1$, we know $d > 0$. Consequently, the term $\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$ is strictly positive.\nThis means $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}}$, $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}}$, and $L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}}$ are all greater than $L_{\\mathrm{IoU}}$.\n\nComparing the remaining three, we see that $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}}$. We need only compare $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}}$ with $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}}$.\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} = 0.5 + 2\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\nSince $2\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 > \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$, it is evident that $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} > L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}}$.\nThus, we have the ordering:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} > L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}} > L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} $$\nThe loss that yields the largest penalty value is the Generalized Intersection over Union loss, $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}}$. According to the problem's encoding, this corresponds to $k=2$.",
