This exercise strips away the typical complexities of a full Transformer architecture to reveal this core function. By analyzing a simplified scenario where queries, keys, and values are identical ($Q=K=V=X$) and the input sequence has a uniform similarity structure, you will derive the conditions under which attention learns to either copy inputs or average them, providing fundamental intuition about its behavior .",

            "problem": "Consider a single-head self-attention layer using the scaled dot-product mechanism with no positional encodings and no residual connections. Let the input sequence be $X = (x_{1}, x_{2}, \\dots, x_{n})$, where each token embedding $x_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The queries, keys, and values are defined by $Q = K = X$ and $V = X$. The attention logits are constructed by scaling pairwise dot products with a nonnegative inverse-temperature parameter $s \\geq 0$, so that for each pair $\\{i,j\\}$ the logit is $L_{ij} = s \\, \\langle x_{i}, x_{j} \\rangle$, and the row-wise attention weights are $A_{ij} = \\exp(L_{ij}) \\big/ \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\exp(L_{ik})$. The output of the attention layer is $Y = A V$, where $A$ is the matrix of row-wise normalized weights.\n\nAssume the following low-complexity similarity structure for the sequence: there exist real numbers $m$ and $c$ such that $\\langle x_{i}, x_{i} \\rangle = m$ for all $i$, and $\\langle x_{i}, x_{j} \\rangle = c$ for all $i \\neq j$, with $m > c$. In this setting, an identity-like behavior is characterized by each query placing almost-all mass on its own key, quantified by the diagonal attention weights satisfying $A_{ii} \\geq 1 - \\tau$ for a prescribed tolerance $0  \\tau  1$.

Express the final answer as a single closed-form expression, and do not round.\n\nFinally, briefly justify, using only the same base definitions, what the attention weights become when the data are maximally low-entropy in the sense that $x_{1} = x_{2} = \\dots = x_{n}$ (you are not required to provide a numerical value for this justification).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a lower bound on the inverse-temperature scaling parameter $s$ that guarantees a specified level of self-attention, and an analysis of a degenerate case. The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe primary task is to find the minimum value of $s$ such that the diagonal attention weights $A_{ii}$ are at least $1 - \\tau$ for a given tolerance $\\tau \\in (0, 1)$. The attention weights are defined by the softmax function applied row-wise to the matrix of logits $L_{ij}$. For any row $i$, the diagonal weight $A_{ii}$ is given by:\n$$\nA_{ii} = \\frac{\\exp(L_{ii})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\exp(L_{ik})}\n$$\nThe logits are $L_{ij} = s \\langle x_{i}, x_{j} \\rangle$, with $s \\geq 0$. Using the provided similarity structure, we have $\\langle x_{i}, x_{i} \\rangle = m$ and $\\langle x_{i}, x_{j} \\rangle = c$ for all $i \\neq j$. This allows us to express the logits as $L_{ii} = sm$ and $L_{ij} = sc$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $A_{ii}$, we find that the denominator can be separated into the term for $k=i$ and the $n-1$ terms for $k \\neq i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\exp(L_{ik}) = \\exp(L_{ii}) + \\sum_{k=1, k \\neq i}^{n} \\exp(L_{ik}) = \\exp(sm) + (n-1)\\exp(sc)\n$$\nThe expression for $A_{ii}$ thus becomes independent of the index $i$:\n$$\nA_{ii} = \\frac{\\exp(sm)}{\\exp(sm) + (n-1)\\exp(sc)}\n$$\nThe condition to be satisfied is $A_{ii} \\geq 1 - \\tau$. We can directly form the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\exp(sm)}{\\exp(sm) + (n-1)\\exp(sc)} \\geq 1 - \\tau\n$$\nSince the denominator is a sum of positive terms, and $1-\\tau  0$, we can multiply both sides by the denominator without altering the inequality's direction:\n$$\n\\exp(sm) \\geq (1 - \\tau) \\left( \\exp(sm) + (n-1)\\exp(sc) \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the $(1-\\tau)$ term:\n$$\n\\exp(sm) \\geq (1-\\tau)\\exp(sm) + (n-1)(1-\\tau)\\exp(sc)\n$$\nCollecting the terms involving $\\exp(sm)$:\n$$\n\\exp(sm) - (1-\\tau)\\exp(sm) \\geq (n-1)(1-\\tau)\\exp(sc)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau \\exp(sm) \\geq (n-1)(1-\\tau)\\exp(sc)\n$$\nTo isolate the dependence on $s$, we can divide by $\\tau \\exp(sc)$. Since $\\tau  0$ and $\\exp(sc)  0$, this is a valid operation that preserves the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\exp(sm)}{\\exp(sc)} \\geq \\frac{(n-1)(1-\\tau)}{\\tau}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents, $\\exp(a)/\\exp(b) = \\exp(a-b)$:\n$$\n\\exp(s(m-c)) \\geq \\frac{(n-1)(1-\\tau)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe argument of the logarithm on the right side is positive because $n \\geq 2$ implies $n-1  0$, and $0  \\tau  1$ implies $1-\\tau  0$. We can take the natural logarithm of both sides. As $\\ln(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function, the inequality is preserved:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp(s(m-c))\\right) \\geq \\ln\\left(\\frac{(n-1)(1-\\tau)}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\n$$\ns(m-c) \\geq \\ln\\left(\\frac{(n-1)(1-\\tau)}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states $m  c$, which implies $m - c  0$. We can therefore divide by $(m-c)$ to solve for $s$:\n$$\ns \\geq \\frac{1}{m-c} \\ln\\left(\\frac{(n-1)(1-\\tau)}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThis inequality provides the explicit closed-form lower bound on $s$ that guarantees the desired identity-like behavior.\n\nNext, we instantiate this bound for the concrete case where $n = 6$, $m = 1$, $c = 0.1$, and $\\tau = 0.02$.\nThe components of the expression are:\n- $m-c = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 = \\frac{9}{10}$\n- $n-1 = 6-1 = 5$\n- $1-\\tau = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 = \\frac{98}{100}$\n- $\\tau = 0.02 = \\frac{2}{100}$\n\nSubstituting these into the argument of the logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{(n-1)(1-\\tau)}{\\tau} = \\frac{5 \\times 0.98}{0.02} = \\frac{5 \\times 98}{2} = 5 \\times 49 = 245\n$$\nThe lower bound for $s$ is therefore:\n$$\ns \\geq \\frac{1}{0.9} \\ln(245) = \\frac{10}{9} \\ln(245)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the instantiated bound.\n\nFinally, we are asked to justify what the attention weights become when the data are maximally low-entropy, i.e., $x_{1} = x_{2} = \\dots = x_{n}$.\nIn this scenario, all input vectors are identical. Let $x_i = x_0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The pairwise dot products become uniform:\n$$\n\\langle x_{i}, x_{j} \\rangle = \\langle x_{0}, x_{0} \\rangle \\quad \\forall i, j\n$$\nLet this constant dot product value be $M = \\langle x_{0}, x_{0} \\rangle$. The logits are then all equal:\n$$\nL_{ij} = s \\langle x_{i}, x_{j} \\rangle = sM \\quad \\forall i, j\n$$\nThe attention weight $A_{ij}$ is calculated as:\n$$\nA_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp(L_{ij})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\exp(L_{ik})} = \\frac{\\exp(sM)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\exp(sM)}\n$$\nThe denominator is a sum of $n$ identical terms, so $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\exp(sM) = n \\exp(sM)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $A_{ij}$ yields:\n$$\nA_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp(sM)}{n \\exp(sM)} = \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\nThus, when all input tokens are identical, the attention mechanism cannot distinguish between them. The resulting attention matrix $A$ has every entry equal to $1/n$, indicating a uniform distribution of attention from each query to all keys. This represents a state of maximal uncertainty, which is the logical antithesis of the identity-like concentration sought in the main part of the problem.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary definitions and data for a unique and meaningful solution. We proceed with the derivation and computational implementation.\n\nThe analysis is structured in two parts. First, we derive the limiting behavior of the softmax attention output, $a(\\tau)$, as the temperature parameter $\\tau$ approaches zero. Second, we analyze the stability of the attention mechanism under small perturbations, contrasting the argmax selection with the temperate softmax.\n\n**1. Limiting Behavior of Softmax Attention as $\\tau \\to 0^+$**\n\nThe softmax attention output is defined as a weighted sum of value vectors:\n$$ a(\\tau) = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\\tau) v_i $$\nwhere the weights $w_i(\\tau)$ are given by the temperature-scaled softmax function applied to the scores $s_i = q^\\top k_i$:\n$$ w_i(\\tau) = \\frac{\\exp(s_i/\\tau)}{\\sum_{j=1}^n \\exp(s_j/\\tau)} $$\nWe wish to compute the limit $\\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} a(\\tau)$. The analysis hinges on the behavior of the weights $w_i(\\tau)$ in this limit.\n\nLet $s_{\\max} = \\max_{1 \\leq j \\leq n} s_j$ be the maximum score. To avoid numerical overflow and facilitate the limit calculation, we can factor out the term $\\exp(s_{\\max}/\\tau)$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ w_i(\\tau) = \\frac{\\exp(s_{\\max}/\\tau) \\exp((s_i - s_{\\max})/\\tau)}{\\exp(s_{\\max}/\\tau) \\sum_{j=1}^n \\exp((s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau)} = \\frac{\\exp((s_i - s_{\\max})/\\tau)}{\\sum_{j=1}^n \\exp((s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau)} $$\nNow, we examine the limit of the exponential term $\\exp((s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau)$ as $\\tau \\to 0^+$. The behavior depends on whether $s_j$ is equal to $s_{\\max}$.\n\nCase 1: $s_j = s_{\\max}$. In this case, the exponent is $(s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau = 0/\\tau = 0$. Thus, $\\exp((s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n\nCase 2: $s_j  s_{\\max}$. Here, the difference $s_j - s_{\\max}$ is a strictly negative constant. As $\\tau \\to 0^+$, the exponent $(s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau \\to -\\infty$. Consequently, $\\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\exp((s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau) = 0$.\n\nLet $I_{\\max} = \\{i \\mid s_i = s_{\\max}\\}$ be the set of indices corresponding to the maximum score, and let $M = |I_{\\max}|$ be the number of such indices. We can now evaluate the limit of the denominator of $w_i(\\tau)$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\exp((s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau) = \\sum_{j \\in I_{\\max}} \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\exp((s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau) + \\sum_{j \\notin I_{\\max}} \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\exp((s_j - s_{\\max})/\\tau) $$\n$$ = \\sum_{j \\in I_{\\max}} 1 + \\sum_{j \\notin I_{\\max}} 0 = M $$\nThe limit of the numerator $\\exp((s_i - s_{\\max})/\\tau)$ is $1$ if $i \\in I_{\\max}$ and $0$ if $i \\notin I_{\\max}$.\n\nCombining these results, the limit of the weight $w_i(\\tau)$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} w_i(\\tau) = \\begin{cases} 1/M  \\text{if } i \\in I_{\\max} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } i \\notin I_{\\max} \\end{cases} $$\nThis demonstrates that as $\\tau \\to 0^+$, the softmax function concentrates all of its probability mass on the indices that achieve the maximum score, distributing it uniformly among them. It effectively becomes a \"soft argmax\".\n\nNow, we can find the limit of the attention output $a(\\tau)$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} a(\\tau) = \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\\tau) v_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} w_i(\\tau)\\right) v_i $$\nSubstituting the limiting weights:\n$$ \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} a(\\tau) = \\sum_{i \\in I_{\\max}} \\frac{1}{M} v_i + \\sum_{i \\notin I_{\\max}} 0 \\cdot v_i = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i \\in I_{\\max}} v_i $$\nThe limiting attention output is the arithmetic mean of the value vectors whose corresponding keys achieved the maximum score.\n\nThe problem defines the argmax attention output as $a^\\star = v_{i^\\star}$, where $i^\\star = \\operatorname{argmax}_{i} s_i$ with a fixed tie-breaking rule. If the maximum score is unique, then $I_{\\max} = \\{i^\\star\\}$ and $M=1$. In this common scenario, the limit simplifies to:\n$$ \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} a(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{1} v_{i^\\star} = v_{i^\\star} = a^\\star $$\nThus, when the maximum score is unique, the softmax attention output converges to the argmax attention output.\n\n**2. Brittleness of Argmax Selection and the Regularizing Role of Temperature**\n\nThe argmax selection is inherently discontinuous. The choice of $i^\\star$ depends on the ordering of the scores $s_i(q) = q^\\top k_i$. A small perturbation to the query, $q' = q + \\delta q$, induces a change in the scores: $s_i(q') = s_i(q) + (\\delta q)^\\top k_i$. If two scores, say $s_j(q)$ and $s_k(q)$, are very close, even an infinitesimal perturbation $\\delta q$ can alter their relative order, causing $i^\\star$ to jump from one index to another. This results in a discrete change in the output $a^\\star$, from $v_j$ to $v_k$, which can be substantial. This instability is a form of \"brittleness\".\n\nIn contrast, for any strictly positive temperature $\\tau  0$, the softmax attention output $a(\\tau)$ is a continuous and differentiable function of the query $q$. The weights $w_i(\\tau)$ are smooth functions of the scores $s_i$, which are linear in $q$. Consequently, a small change $\\delta q$ in the query leads to a correspondingly small change in the output $a(\\tau)$. The change is governed by the gradient: $a(q+\\delta q, \\tau) \\approx a(q, \\tau) + (\\nabla_q a(q, \\tau)) \\cdot \\delta q$.\n\nA higher temperature $\\tau$ has a smoothing or regularizing effect. It \"flattens\" the softmax distribution, meaning the weights $w_i(\\tau)$ are less sensitive to small differences in scores. This makes the output $a(\\tau)$ more robust to minor perturbations in $q$. Conversely, as $\\tau \\to 0$, the softmax function becomes steeper, and the gradient of $a(\\tau)$ with respect to $q$ can become very large, particularly in directions that affect the difference between near-maximum scores.

The goal is to demonstrate, from first principles, that backpropagation through the attention with a causal mask does not propagate gradients from a token at time index $t$ into parameters associated with future tokens at indices $j$ with $j > t$. Use the following formal setting and requirements.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- Let $L$ denote the sequence length and let $d$ denote the dimensionality of queries and keys. Let $d_v$ denote the dimensionality of values.\n- Let $\\mathbf{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, $\\mathbf{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, and $\\mathbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d_v}$ denote the query, key, and value matrices, respectively.\n- Define the scaled dot-product score matrix by\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\, \\mathbf{Q} \\, \\mathbf{K}^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}.\n$$\n- Define the causal mask $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{L \\times L}$ by $\\mathbf{M}_{i,j} = 1$ if and only if $j \\le i$, and $\\mathbf{M}_{i,j} = 0$ otherwise.\n- Construct the masked scores $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}$ by setting $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}_{i,j} = \\mathbf{S}_{i,j}$ for $j \\le i$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}_{i,j} = -\\infty$ for $j > i$.\n- Let $\\operatorname{softmax}$ denote the softmax function applied row-wise.

Do not use any external automatic differentiation frameworks; rely only on the fundamental rules of differentiation and linear algebra to derive and implement the VJP formulas.\n  - Uses numerically stable softmax computations by subtracting the row-wise maximum before exponentiation.\n- Testing objective:\n  - For each test, set the upstream cotangent $\\mathbf{G_Y}$ to be all zeros except a single nonzero entry at a chosen time index $t$ and value channel $c$, namely $\\mathbf{G_Y}_{t, c} = 1$ and all other entries equal to $0$.\n  - Verify that the VJP computed gradients $\\mathbf{G_K}$ and $\\mathbf{G_V}$ are zero for all future token rows $j$ with $j > t$ under causal masking. Use a numerical tolerance of $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$ for the zero check.\n- Angle units are not applicable to this task.\n- There are no physical units in this problem.\n\nTest suite and parameter values:\n- Use the following deterministic test cases, each specified by $(L, d, d_v, t, c, s, \\text{causal})$, where $s$ is a random seed for constructing inputs, and `causal` is a boolean indicating whether to use the causal mask.\n  - Test $1$: $(L, d, d_v, t, c, s, \\text{causal}) = (4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, \\text{True})$.\n  - Test $2$: $(L, d, d_v, t, c, s, \\text{causal}) = (1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, \\text{True})$.\n  - Test $3$: $(L, d, d_v, t, c, s, \\text{causal}) = (5, 4, 3, 4, 2, 2, \\text{True})$.\n  - Test $4$ (control without masking): $(L, d, d_v, t, c, s, \\text{causal}) = (4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, \\text{False})$.\n- For each test case, construct $\\mathbf{Q}$, $\\mathbf{K}$, and $\\mathbf{V}$ by sampling independent standard normal entries using the given seed $s$ for reproducibility, and then scaling by a factor of $0.5$ for numerical moderation. Formally, set the pseudorandom number generator seed to $s$, sample $\\mathbf{Q}$, $\\mathbf{K}$, and $\\mathbf{V}$ with independent entries from $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and then replace each sampled matrix by $0.5$ times that matrix.\n- For each test, define the upstream cotangent $\\mathbf{G_Y}$ as the zero matrix in $\\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d_v}$ except for $\\mathbf{G_Y}_{t,c} = 1$.\n- For each test, the program must evaluate whether, under causal masking, gradients to future tokens are zero by computing the boolean predicate\n$$\n\\max_{j > t} \\left( \\max\\left( \\left| \\mathbf{G_K}[j,:] \\right| \\right), \\, \\max\\left( \\left| \\mathbf{G_V}[j,:] \\right| \\right) \\right) \\le \\varepsilon,\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) for a single-head scaled dot-product attention mechanism, with a specific focus on demonstrating the effect of causal masking on gradient flow. We must validate that gradients from an output token at time $t$ do not propagate to input parameters associated with future tokens $j > t$.\n\nFirst, we will derive the VJP equations from first principles by applying the chain rule to the sequence of operations in the forward pass. Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be a scalar loss function. The VJP for a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ maps the cotangent (gradient) with respect to its output, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{y}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, to the cotangent with respect to its input, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. We are given the upstream cotangent $\\mathbf{G_Y} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{Y}}$ and must compute $\\mathbf{G_Q} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{Q}}$, $\\mathbf{G_K} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{K}}$, and $\\mathbf{G_V} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{V}}$.\n\nThe forward pass is defined by the following sequence of operations:\n1.  Scaled dot-product scores: $\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{K}^\\top$\n2.  Masking: $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}} = \\operatorname{mask}(\\mathbf{S}, \\mathbf{M})$ (where masked elements are set to $-\\infty$)\n3.  Row-wise softmax: $\\mathbf{A} = \\operatorname{softmax}(\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}})$\n4.  Output computation: $\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{V}$\n\nWe will derive the VJPs by reversing this sequence.\n\n**Step 1: VJP for Output Computation $\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{V}$**\n\nThis operation is a standard matrix multiplication. We are given $\\mathbf{G_Y} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{Y}}$. Using the VJP rules for matrix multiplication ($C = AB \\implies \\mathbf{G_A} = \\mathbf{G_C} B^\\top, \\mathbf{G_B} = A^\\top \\mathbf{G_C}$), we find the cotangents for $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G_A} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{A}} = \\mathbf{G_Y} \\mathbf{V}^\\top\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{G_V} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{V}} = \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{G_Y}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: VJP for Row-wise Softmax $\\mathbf{A} = \\operatorname{softmax}(\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}})$**\n\nThe softmax function is applied to each row of $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}$. For a single row vector $\\mathbf{a} = \\operatorname{softmax}(\\mathbf{s})$, the VJP mapping $\\mathbf{g_a}$ to $\\mathbf{g_s}$ is derived from the Jacobian of the softmax function, $J_{jk} = \\frac{\\partial a_j}{\\partial s_k} = a_j(\\delta_{jk} - a_k)$. The VJP is:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{g_s})_k = \\sum_j (\\mathbf{g_a})_j J_{jk} = \\sum_j (\\mathbf{g_a})_j a_j(\\delta_{jk} - a_k) = (\\mathbf{g_a})_k a_k - a_k \\sum_j (\\mathbf{g_a})_j a_j\n$$\nIn vector notation, this is $\\mathbf{g_s} = \\mathbf{a} \\odot (\\mathbf{g_a} - (\\mathbf{g_a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}))$, where $\\odot$ is the element-wise product and $\\cdot$ is the dot product. Applying this to each row $i$ of the matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{G_A}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{G}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}})_{i,:} = \\mathbf{A}_{i,:} \\odot \\left( \\mathbf{G_A}_{i,:} - \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^L \\mathbf{A}_{i,k} \\mathbf{G_A}_{i,k} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis computes $\\mathbf{G}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}}$ from $\\mathbf{G_A}$.\n\n**Step 3: VJP for Masking $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}} = \\operatorname{mask}(\\mathbf{S}, \\mathbf{M})$**\n\nIn the forward pass, if $\\mathbf{M}_{i,j} = 0$ (i.e., $j  i$), then $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}_{i,j}$ is set to the constant $-\\infty$. If $\\mathbf{M}_{i,j} = 1$ (i.e., $j \\le i$), then $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}_{i,j} = \\mathbf{S}_{i,j}$. The gradient is passed backward accordingly:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{G_S})_{i,j} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{S}_{i,j}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}_{i,j}} \\frac{\\partial \\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}_{i,j}}{\\partial \\mathbf{S}_{i,j}}\n$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}_{i,j}}{\\partial \\mathbf{S}_{i,j}}$ is $1$ if $j \\le i$ and $0$ if $j  i$. Therefore, the gradient only flows through the unmasked elements:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{G_S})_{i,j} = \\begin{cases} (\\mathbf{G}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}})_{i,j}  \\text{if } j \\le i \\\\ 0  \\text{if } j  i \\end{cases}\n$$\nIf causal masking is disabled, $\\mathbf{G_S} = \\mathbf{G}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}}$.\n\n**Step 4: VJP for Scaled Dot-Product $\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{K}^\\top$**\n\nThis step is again a matrix multiplication, scaled by a constant $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$. Applying the VJP rules:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G_Q} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{Q}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\mathbf{G_S} (\\mathbf{K}^\\top)^\\top = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\mathbf{G_S} \\mathbf{K}\n$$\nFor $\\mathbf{K}$, we first find the gradient with respect to $\\mathbf{K}^\\top$ and then transpose the result.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{K}^\\top} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{G_S}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{G_K} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{K}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{K}^\\top} \\right)^\\top = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} (\\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{G_S})^\\top = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\mathbf{G_S}^\\top \\mathbf{Q}\n$$\n\n**Analysis of Causal Gradient Flow**\nThe testing objective is to verify that for an upstream cotangent $\\mathbf{G_Y}$ that is non-zero only at row $t$, the downstream cotangents $\\mathbf{G_K}$ and $\\mathbf{G_V}$ are zero for all rows $j > t$.\n\n1.  **Gradient to $\\mathbf{V}$**: $\\mathbf{G_V} = \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{G_Y}$. The $j$-th row of $\\mathbf{G_V}$ is $(\\mathbf{G_V})_{j,:} = \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} (\\mathbf{A}^\\top)_{j,i} (\\mathbf{G_Y})_{i,:} = \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} \\mathbf{A}_{i,j} (\\mathbf{G_Y})_{i,:}$. Since $\\mathbf{G_Y}$ is non-zero only at row $t$, this sum reduces to $(\\mathbf{G_V})_{j,:} = \\mathbf{A}_{t,j} (\\mathbf{G_Y})_{t,:}$. With causal masking, the attention weights matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is lower triangular, meaning $\\mathbf{A}_{i,j} = 0$ for $j  i$. Thus, for our case where $i=t$, we have $\\mathbf{A}_{t,j} = 0$ for all $j  t$. Consequently, $(\\mathbf{G_V})_{j,:}$ is a zero vector for all $j  t$.\n\n2.  **Gradient to $\\mathbf{K}$**: Tracing the gradient propagation to $\\mathbf{K}$ reveals a similar logic.\n    - $\\mathbf{G_A} = \\mathbf{G_Y} \\mathbf{V}^\\top$. Since $\\mathbf{G_Y}$ has only row $t$ non-zero, $\\mathbf{G_A}$ will also have only row $t$ non-zero.\n    - $\\mathbf{G}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}}$ is computed from $\\mathbf{G_A}$, so it also will have only row $t$ non-zero.\n    - $\\mathbf{G_S}$ is computed from $\\mathbf{G}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}}$ by applying the causal mask. This means $(\\mathbf{G_S})_{i,j} = 0$ for all $i \\ne t$, and also $(\\mathbf{G_S})_{t,j} = 0$ for all $j  t$. In summary, $\\mathbf{G_S}$ is a matrix with non-zero entries existing only at indices $(t,j)$ where $j \\le t$.\n    - Finally, $\\mathbf{G_K} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\mathbf{G_S}^\\top \\mathbf{Q}$. The $j$-th row of $\\mathbf{G_K}$ is given by $(\\mathbf{G_K})_{j,:} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} (\\mathbf{G_S}^\\top)_{j,i} \\mathbf{Q}_{i,:} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} (\\mathbf{G_S})_{i,j} \\mathbf{Q}_{i,:}$.\n    - Since $(\\mathbf{G_S})_{i,j}$ is non-zero only for $i=t$, this becomes $(\\mathbf{G_K})_{j,:} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} (\\mathbf{G_S})_{t,j} \\mathbf{Q}_{t,:}$.\n    - For any future token $j  t$, we know from the structure of $\\mathbf{G_S}$ that $(\\mathbf{G_S})_{t,j} = 0$. Therefore, $(\\mathbf{G_K})_{j,:}$ must be a zero vector for all $j  t$.\n\nThis confirms from first principles that causal masking correctly prevents information from a given time step from flowing backward to influence the parameters of future time steps. The implementation will codify these derived VJP equations and verify this property numerically.",
