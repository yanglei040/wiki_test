            "solution": "This problem consists of two parts. The first part requires deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the equality of occlusion attribution and Gradient-times-Input attribution. The second part involves a direct computation of these quantities and their difference for a specific nonlinear model.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Necessary and Sufficient Conditions\n\nWe are given two attribution methods for a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\to \\mathbb{R}$:\n1.  The zero-baseline occlusion attribution: $A_{\\mathrm{occ},j}(x) \\triangleq f(x) - f\\big(x^{(j \\leftarrow 0)}\\big)$.\n2.  The Gradient-times-Input attribution: $A_{\\mathrm{gxi},j}(x) \\triangleq x_{j} \\,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{j}}(x)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the necessary and sufficient conditions on $f$ such that $A_{\\mathrm{occ},j}(x) = A_{\\mathrm{gxi},j}(x)$ for every input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and every feature index $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,d\\}$. The condition is thus:\n$$\nf(x) - f\\big(x^{(j \\leftarrow 0)}\\big) = x_{j} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{j}}(x) \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, \\forall j \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}\n$$\n\nLet us analyze this condition for a single, arbitrary feature $j$. To isolate the dependence on the variable $x_j$, we fix all other coordinates $x_k$ for $k \\neq j$. We define a single-variable function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n$$\ng(t) \\triangleq f(x_1, \\dots, x_{j-1}, t, x_{j+1}, \\dots, x_d)\n$$\nThe partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x_j$ is the ordinary derivative of $g$ with respect to its argument: $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{j}}(x) = g'(x_j)$. The vector $x^{(j \\leftarrow 0)}$ corresponds to setting the argument of $g$ to $0$, so $f(x^{(j \\leftarrow 0)}) = g(0)$. With this notation, the required condition for the specific feature $j$ and input $x$ becomes an equation for $g$ evaluated at $t=x_j$:\n$$\ng(x_j) - g(0) = x_j g'(x_j)\n$$\nSince this must hold for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, it must hold for any value of $x_j$. Let's replace $x_j$ with a generic variable $t$. The function $g(t)$ must satisfy the identity:\n$$\ng(t) - g(0) = t g'(t) \\quad \\forall t \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this into a first-order ordinary differential equation for $g(t)$. Let's define a new function $H(t) \\triangleq g(t) - t g'(t)$. The condition is equivalent to stating that $H(t) = g(0)$ for all $t$. Since $g(0)$ is a constant with respect to $t$, the function $H(t)$ must be constant. Consequently, its derivative with respect to $t$ must be zero for all $t$.\n$$\nH'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( g(t) - t g'(t) \\right) = 0\n$$\nUsing the linearity of differentiation and the product rule, we find:\n$$\ng'(t) - \\left( \\frac{d}{dt}(t) \\cdot g'(t) + t \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}(g'(t)) \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\ng'(t) - (1 \\cdot g'(t) + t \\cdot g''(t)) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-t g''(t) = 0\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we must have $g''(t) = 0$ for all $t \\ne 0$. If we assume $f$ is a twice continuously differentiable function ($C^2$), then $g''(t)$ is continuous, which implies $g''(t)=0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe condition $g''(t) = 0$ means that the second derivative of $g$ is zero. Integrating twice with respect to $t$ yields:\n$g'(t) = c_1$\n$g(t) = c_1 t + c_2$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants of integration. This is the definition of an affine linear function. The constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ can depend on the other coordinates $x_k$ ($k \\ne j$) that were held fixed.\nIn terms of $f$, the condition $g''(t)=0$ is $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_j^2} = 0$. This must hold for all $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}$.\n\nThis implies that for each $j$, the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}$ is independent of $x_j$. Let's write this as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}(x) = \\phi_j(x_1, \\dots, x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}, \\dots, x_d)\n$$\nThis must hold for every $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}$. Now, we use the equality of mixed partial derivatives (Clairaut's theorem), assuming $f \\in C^2$. For any two distinct indices $j, k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_k \\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_k}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_j}{\\partial x_k}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_k} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_k}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nSince $\\phi_j$ is independent of $x_j$ and $\\phi_k$ is independent of $x_k$, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_j}{\\partial x_k}$ is independent of $x_j$, and $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_k}{\\partial x_j}$ is independent of $x_k$.\n\nThe result $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_j^2}=0$ for all $j$, along with the equality of mixed partials, forces all second-order partial derivatives to be zero. Consider $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_k}$ for $j \\neq k$. Since $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}$ is independent of $x_j$, we can write $f(x) = x_j \\phi_j(x_{-j}) + \\psi_j(x_{-j})$. Then $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_k} = x_j \\frac{\\partial \\phi_j}{\\partial x_k} + \\frac{\\partial \\psi_j}{\\partial x_k}$. We also know $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_k} = \\phi_k(x_{-k})$ which is independent of $x_j$. For this to hold, the coefficient of $x_j$ must be zero, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_j}{\\partial x_k}=0$. This means $\\phi_j$ is independent of $x_k$ for all $k \\ne j$. Thus, $\\phi_j$ must be a constant, say $w_j$.\n\nSo, we have established that $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j} = w_j$ for all $j$, where each $w_j$ is a constant. This means the gradient of $f$ is a constant vector $w = (w_1, \\dots, w_d)^\\top$.\nIf $\\nabla f(x) = w$, we can integrate to find the form of $f(x)$. Integrating $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} = w_1$ gives $f(x) = w_1 x_1 + h_1(x_2, \\dots, x_d)$. Differentiating this with respect to $x_2$ gives $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial h_1}{\\partial x_2}$. Since we know $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = w_2$, we have $\\frac{\\partial h_1}{\\partial x_2} = w_2$. Integrating this gives $h_1(x_2, \\dots, x_d) = w_2 x_2 + h_2(x_3, \\dots, x_d)$. Continuing this process inductively, we arrive at:\n$$\nf(x) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\dots + w_d x_d + b\n$$\nwhere $b$ is a constant of integration. This can be written as $f(x) = w^\\top x + b$. This is the general form of an affine linear function. This is the necessary condition.\n\nTo show sufficiency, let's assume $f(x) = w^\\top x + b = \\sum_{k=1}^d w_k x_k + b$.\nThe occlusion attribution is:\n$A_{\\mathrm{occ},j}(x) = f(x) - f(x^{(j \\leftarrow 0)}) = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^d w_k x_k + b \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{k \\ne j} w_k x_k + w_j \\cdot 0 + b \\right) = w_j x_j$.\nThe Gradient-times-Input attribution is:\n$A_{\\mathrm{gxi},j}(x) = x_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}(x)$.\nThe partial derivative is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^d w_k x_k + b \\right) = w_j$.\nTherefore, $A_{\\mathrm{gxi},j}(x) = x_j \\cdot w_j$.\nSince both attributions equal $w_j x_j$, the equality holds.\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the function $f$ must be an affine linear function of its input $x$.\n\n### Part 2: Computation for a Specific Model\n\nWe are given the model $f(x) \\;=\\; w^{\\top}x \\;+\\; b \\;+\\; \\gamma\\, x_{1} x_{2} \\;+\\; \\delta\\, x_{2}^{2}$ with parameters $w = (1,-2,3)^\\top$, $b = 0$, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\delta = -1$.\nThe specific function is:\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (1 \\cdot x_1 - 2 \\cdot x_2 + 3 \\cdot x_3) + 0 + \\frac{1}{2} x_1 x_2 - 1 \\cdot x_2^2\n$$\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1 - 2x_2 + 3x_3 + \\frac{1}{2} x_1 x_2 - x_2^2\n$$\nThis function is not affine linear due to the terms $\\frac{1}{2} x_1 x_2$ and $-x_2^2$. Therefore, based on Part 1, we do not expect the two attributions to be equal in general.\n\nThe input is $x = (2, -1, 4)$ and the feature is $j=2$. We need to compute $D = A_{\\mathrm{occ},2}(x) - A_{\\mathrm{gxi},2}(x)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the occlusion attribution $A_{\\mathrm{occ},2}(x) = f(x) - f(x^{(2 \\leftarrow 0)})$.\nThe original input is $x = (2, -1, 4)$.\nThe occluded input is $x^{(2 \\leftarrow 0)} = (2, 0, 4)$.\n\n$f(2, -1, 4) = (2) - 2(-1) + 3(4) + \\frac{1}{2}(2)(-1) - (-1)^2$\n$f(2, -1, 4) = 2 + 2 + 12 - 1 - 1 = 14$.\n\n$f(2, 0, 4) = (2) - 2(0) + 3(4) + \\frac{1}{2}(2)(0) - (0)^2$\n$f(2, 0, 4) = 2 - 0 + 12 + 0 - 0 = 14$.\n\n$A_{\\mathrm{occ},2}(x) = 14 - 14 = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the Gradient-times-Input attribution $A_{\\mathrm{gxi},2}(x) = x_2 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}(x)$.\nFirst, we find the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} \\left( x_1 - 2x_2 + 3x_3 + \\frac{1}{2} x_1 x_2 - x_2^2 \\right) = -2 + \\frac{1}{2}x_1 - 2x_2\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this partial derivative at the input $x=(2,-1,4)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}(2, -1, 4) = -2 + \\frac{1}{2}(2) - 2(-1) = -2 + 1 + 2 = 1\n$$\nNow we can compute $A_{\\mathrm{gxi},2}(x)$:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{gxi},2}(x) = x_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}(x) = (-1) \\cdot (1) = -1\n$$\nFinally, we compute the discrepancy $D$:\n$$\nD = A_{\\mathrm{occ},2}(x) - A_{\\mathrm{gxi},2}(x) = 0 - (-1) = 1\n$$",

Also, $x^{\\star}_i - x'_i = 1-0=1$ for all $i$.\nThe partial derivatives of $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = x_1 x_2 + x_3 - x_1 x_2 x_3$ are:\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} = x_2 - x_2 x_3 = x_2(1-x_3)$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = x_1 - x_1 x_3 = x_1(1-x_3)$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_3} = 1 - x_1 x_2$\n\nWe evaluate these derivatives along the path $x(\\alpha)=(\\alpha,\\alpha,\\alpha)$:\n- $\\frac{\\partial f(x(\\alpha))}{\\partial x_1} = \\alpha(1-\\alpha) = \\alpha - \\alpha^2$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f(x(\\alpha))}{\\partial x_2} = \\alpha(1-\\alpha) = \\alpha - \\alpha^2$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f(x(\\alpha))}{\\partial x_3} = 1 - \\alpha \\cdot \\alpha = 1 - \\alpha^2$\n\nNow we compute the integrals:\n- $\\mathrm{IG}_1(x^{\\star}) = \\int_{0}^{1} (\\alpha - \\alpha^2) \\, d\\alpha = \\left[\\frac{\\alpha^2}{2} - \\frac{\\alpha^3}{3}\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n- $\\mathrm{IG}_2(x^{\\star}) = \\int_{0}^{1} (\\alpha - \\alpha^2) \\, d\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n- $\\mathrm{IG}_3(x^{\\star}) = \\int_{0}^{1} (1 - \\alpha^2) \\, d\\alpha = \\left[\\alpha - \\frac{\\alpha^3}{3}\\right]_0^1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe sum of IG attributions is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mathrm{IG}_i(x^{\\star}) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n$$\nWe must verify this equals $f(x^{\\star}) - f(x')$.\n- $f(x^{\\star}) = f(1,1,1) = 1(1) + 1 - 1(1)(1) = 1$.\n- $f(x') = f(0,0,0) = 0(0) + 0 - 0(0)(0) = 0$.\nSo, $f(x^{\\star}) - f(x') = 1 - 0 = 1$. The sum is correct, confirming the completeness property for IG.\n\n### Task 3: Comparison and Ratio Calculation\n\nWe compare the sums of attributions for the two methods.\nFor SHAP, the sum of attributions is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\phi_i = \\phi_1 + \\phi_2 + \\phi_3 = \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{5}{24} = \\frac{2}{24} + \\frac{2}{24} + \\frac{5}{24} = \\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nThis sum equals $f(x^{\\star}) - \\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$, as required by the efficiency property of Shapley values:\n$f(x^{\\star}) - \\mathbb{E}[f(X)] = 1 - v(\\emptyset) = 1 - \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\n\nFor IG, the sum of attributions is $\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mathrm{IG}_i(x^{\\star}) = 1$, which equals $f(x^{\\star}) - f(x') = 1-0=1$.\n\nThe sums are different ($\\frac{3}{8} \\ne 1$), illustrating that the total attribution score depends on the method and its choice of baseline (expected value for SHAP, a specific point $x'$ for IG). This is a known difference between the two methods, often described as non-additivity across methods.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\mathrm{IG}_3(x^{\\star})}{\\phi_3} = \\frac{2/3}{5/24} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{24}{5} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 8}{5} = \\frac{16}{5}\n$$\nThe ratio is not $1$, which highlights that even for a single feature, the attribution scores from different methods can differ significantly, not just in their sum but in their individual values.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and fully specified. It provides a clear, computationally verifiable task in the domain of deep learning model interpretability. We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the causal contribution $\\Delta$ of a specific attention head to a model's prediction. This is defined as the change in the predicted probability when the post-attention activations of that head for an example $X_E$ are replaced with those from a counterexample $X_C$. The formula is $\\Delta = p_{\\text{patched}} - p_{\\text{original}}$.\n\nThe solution requires implementing the forward pass of the specified two-head attention model and then applying the activation patching procedure for the four given test cases.\n\n**1. Model Forward Pass**\n\nThe forward pass computes the prediction probability $p$ for a given input token embedding matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d_{\\text{model}}}$. The dimensions are given as $L=3$, $d_{\\text{model}}=6$, $H=2$, and the per-head dimension is $d_h = d_{\\text{model}} / H = 3$.\n\n**Step 1.1: Per-Head Computations**\n\nFor each head $h \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, we calculate the query ($Q^{(h)}$), key ($K^{(h)}$), and value ($V^{(h)}$) matrices. The problem specifies weight matrices $W_Q^{(h)}$, $W_K^{(h)}$, $W_V^{(h)}$ that act as selectors.\n\nFor head $h=0$, the weights select the first $d_h=3$ columns of the input embedding $X$. Thus:\n$$\nQ^{(0)} = K^{(0)} = V^{(0)} = X_{[ :, 0:3 ]} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}\n$$\n\nFor head $h=1$, the weights select the last $d_h=3$ columns of $X$:\n$$\nQ^{(1)} = K^{(1)} = V^{(1)} = X_{[ :, 3:6 ]} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the scaled dot-product attention scores $S^{(h)}$, the attention weights $A^{(h)}$ via a row-wise softmax, and the post-attention head output $O^{(h)}$.\n$$\nS^{(h)} = \\frac{Q^{(h)} (K^{(h)})^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_h}}\n$$\n$$\nA^{(h)}_{i,:} = \\operatorname{softmax}\\left(S^{(h)}_{i,:}\\right) \\quad \\text{where } \\operatorname{softmax}(z)_j = \\frac{e^{z_j}}{\\sum_k e^{z_k}}\n$$\n$$\nO^{(h)} = A^{(h)} V^{(h)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}\n$$\n\n**Step 1.2: MHA Output and Classification**\n\nThe outputs of the two heads, $O^{(0)}$ and $O^{(1)}$, are concatenated to form the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) input $O$:\n$$\nO = \\operatorname{concat}(O^{(0)}, O^{(1)}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 6}\n$$\n\nThis is followed by an output projection $\\tilde{O} = O W_O^\\top$. Since $W_O = I_6$ (the $6 \\times 6$ identity matrix), we have $W_O^\\top = I_6$ and therefore:\n$$\n\\tilde{O} = O I_6 = O\n$$\n\nThe classifier uses the representation of the first token (at index $0$), denoted $\\tilde{o}_{\\text{cls}}$, which is the first row of $\\tilde{O}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{o}_{\\text{cls}} = \\tilde{O}_{0,:} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6}\n$$\n\nA logit $y$ is computed using the weight vector $w = [1, 1, 1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]^\\top$ and bias $b=0$:\n$$\ny = w^\\top \\tilde{o}_{\\text{cls}} + b = \\sum_{i=0}^{5} w_i (\\tilde{o}_{\\text{cls}})_i\n$$\n\nFinally, the prediction probability $p$ is obtained by applying the sigmoid function $\\sigma(\\cdot)$:\n$$\np = \\sigma(y) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-y}}\n$$\n\nThis completes the forward pass for a single input $X$.\n\n**2. Activation Patching Procedure**\n\nTo compute the causal contribution $\\Delta$ for a given example $X_E$, counterexample $X_C$, and target head $h^\\star$, we proceed as follows:\n\n**Step 2.1: Compute Original Probability**\nFirst, we compute the original prediction probability $p_{\\text{original}}$ by performing a full forward pass on the example input $X_E$. This requires computing both head outputs, $O^{(0)}_E$ and $O^{(1)}_E$, from $X_E$.\n$$\np_{\\text{original}} = \\text{compute_prob}(X_E)\n$$\n\n**Step 2.2: Compute Patched Probability**\nNext, we compute the \"patched\" probability $p_{\\text{patched}}$. This involves replacing the activation of the target head $h^\\star$ with the corresponding activation from the counterexample $X_C$, while keeping the other head's activation from the original example $X_E$.\n\nIf $h^\\star = 0$, the patched MHA input is formed using $O^{(0)}_C$ (computed from $X_C$) and $O^{(1)}_E$ (computed from $X_E$):\n$$\nO_{\\text{patched}} = \\operatorname{concat}(O^{(0)}_C, O^{(1)}_E)\n$$\n\nIf $h^\\star = 1$, the patched MHA input uses $O^{(0)}_E$ and $O^{(1)}_C$:\n$$\nO_{\\text{patched}} = \\operatorname{concat}(O^{(0)}_E, O^{(1)}_C)\n$$\n\nFrom $O_{\\text{patched}}$, we compute the patched logit $y_{\\text{patched}}$ and probability $p_{\\text{patched}}$ following the same classification steps as in the standard forward pass.\n\n**Step 2.3: Compute Causal Contribution**\nThe causal contribution $\\Delta$ is the signed difference between the patched and original probabilities:\n$$\n\\Delta = p_{\\text{patched}} - p_{\\text{original}}\n$$\n\nFor the test case where $X_C = X_E$ (Case $3$), the \"patched\" activation $O^{(h^\\star)}_C$ is identical to the original activation $O^{(h^\\star)}_E$. Consequently, $p_{\\text{patched}} = p_{\\text{original}}$, and we expect $\\Delta_3 = 0$, which serves as a sanity check for the implementation.\n\nThe following Python program implements this logic to compute $\\Delta_1, \\Delta_2, \\Delta_3, \\Delta_4$ for the specified test suite.",
