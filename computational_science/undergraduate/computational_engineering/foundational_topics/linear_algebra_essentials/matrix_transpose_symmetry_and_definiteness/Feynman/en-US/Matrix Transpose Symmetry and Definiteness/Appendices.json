            "problem": "You are given the task of designing a memory-efficient representation and matrix-vector multiplication routine for a real, sparse, symmetric matrix that stores only its upper-triangular nonzero entries (including the diagonal). You must implement a complete, runnable program that constructs this representation for a provided test suite, computes the matrix-vector product using only the stored data, evaluates symmetry and definiteness properties, and reports a quantitative memory comparison to a naive unsymmetrized coordinate storage.\n\nDefinitions and requirements:\n\n- Let $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ be symmetric, i.e., $A^T = A$. The input data for $A$ are given as a list of triplets $(i,j,v)$ with $0 \\le i \\le j \\le n-1$, representing $A_{ij} = v$ and, by symmetry, $A_{ji} = v$ when $i \\ne j$.\n- Given a vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the task is to compute $y = A x$ using only the upper-triangular storage.

            "solution": "The problem presented is valid, well-posed, and grounded in the fundamental principles of computational linear algebra. It addresses the practical task of implementing a memory-efficient matrix-vector multiplication for a real, sparse, symmetric matrix and subsequently analyzing its properties. We shall proceed with a rigorous, step-by-step solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is the computation of the matrix-vector product $y = Ax$ for a symmetric matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, where only the non-zero entries in the upper triangle (including the diagonal) are stored. Let the set of stored index-value triplets be $U = \\{(i, j, v) \\,|\\, A_{ij} = v, 0 \\le i \\le j  n\\}$.\n\nThe $k$-th component of the product vector $y$ is defined as $y_k = \\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} A_{kl} x_l$. To compute this using only the upper-triangular entries, we must consider how each stored entry contributes to the product. For each stored triplet $(i, j, v) \\in U$:\n\n$1$. If $i = j$, the entry is on the diagonal. This term $A_{ii} = v$ contributes only to the product component $y_i$. The contribution is $v \\cdot x_i$.\n\n$2$. If $i  j$, the entry is in the strict upper triangle. This term $A_{ij} = v$ contributes $v \\cdot x_j$ to the component $y_i$. Due to the symmetry of $A$, we have $A_{ji} = A_{ij} = v$. This corresponding lower-triangular entry contributes $A_{ji} \\cdot x_i = v \\cdot x_i$ to the component $y_j$.\n\nTherefore, a correct and efficient algorithm can be formulated by initializing a zero vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and iterating through the stored triplets:\n- For each diagonal triplet $(i, i, v)$, update $y_i \\leftarrow y_i + v \\cdot x_i$.\n- For each off-diagonal triplet $(i, j, v)$ with $i  j$, perform two updates: $y_i \\leftarrow y_i + v \\cdot x_j$ and $y_j \\leftarrow y_j + v \\cdot x_i$.\nThis procedure correctly computes the full product $Ax$ by leveraging symmetry.\n\nNext, we must determine if $A$ is symmetric positive definite (SPD). A symmetric matrix is, by definition, positive definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are strictly positive. This provides the most robust criterion for the check. The procedure is as follows:\n$1$. Reconstruct the full dense matrix $A$ from the provided upper-triangular triplets. For each triplet $(i, j, v)$, we set $A_{ij} = v$ and, if $i \\neq j$, also $A_{ji} = v$.\n$2$. Compute the eigenvalues of the resulting symmetric matrix $A$. Specialized numerical routines for symmetric matrices, such as those that compute eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix, are appropriate here.\n$3$. Check if every computed eigenvalue $\\lambda$ satisfies the condition $\\lambda > 0$. If this holds for all eigenvalues, the matrix is SPD.\n\nThe verification of correctness is straightforward. The product vector $y$ computed via the efficient symmetric algorithm is compared against a reference product $y_{\\text{dense}} = A_{\\text{dense}} x$, where $A_{\\text{dense}}$ is the fully reconstructed matrix. The comparison must be performed using an absolute tolerance of $10^{-12}$. Additionally, because $A$ is symmetric ($A = A^T$), the identity $Ax = A^T x$ must hold. This provides a second, albeit related, consistency check.\n\nFinally, we quantify the memory savings. The problem specifies that each stored triplet $(i, j, v)$ consumes $24$ bytes ($2 \\times 8$ bytes for integer indices and $8$ bytes for a double-precision float value).\n- The upper-triangular storage requires $\\text{upper\\_entry\\_count}$ triplets, which is the count of input data.\n- A naive coordinate storage would store all non-zero entries explicitly. For each strictly off-diagonal entry $A_{ij} \\neq 0$ ($i \\neq j$), it stores two triplets, $(i, j, A_{ij})$ and $(j, i, A_{ji})$. For each diagonal entry $A_{ii} \\neq 0$, it stores one triplet.\nThe number of off-diagonal triplets in the input is $\\text{num\\_off\\_diagonal}$. The total number of triplets in the naive storage is thus $\\text{naive\\_entry\\_count} = (\\text{upper\\_entry\\_count} - \\text{num\\_off\\_diagonal}) + 2 \\cdot \\text{num\\_off\\_diagonal} = \\text{upper\\_entry\\_count} + \\text{num\\_off\\_diagonal}$.\nThe bytes saved are calculated as $(\\text{naive\\_entry\\_count} - \\text{upper\\_entry\\_count}) \\times 24$, which simplifies to $\\text{num\\_off\\_diagonal} \\times 24$. This reflects the fact that our efficient scheme saves one triplet storage for each non-zero, off-diagonal pair.\n\nThe implementation will process each test case according to these principles, generating the required five-element list for each.",
