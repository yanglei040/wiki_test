In this context, a triangle is considered well-conditioned if its minimum interior angle is bounded away from $0^{\\circ}$ by a specified lower bound. Your routine must be principled, based on first principles from computational geometry and two-dimensional finite elements, and must make no use of precomputed or shortcut formulas beyond the fundamental laws below.\n\nFundamental base:\n- A triangle with vertices $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, $\\mathbf{c}$ has an interior angle at $\\mathbf{b}$ given by the relation from the dot product:\n$$\n\\angle \\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{c} \\;=\\; \\arccos\\left(\\frac{(\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b})\\cdot(\\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{b})}{\\lVert \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}\\rVert\\,\\lVert \\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{b}\\rVert}\\right).\n$$\n- The signed area of triangle $\\left(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{c}\\right)$ is given by the two-dimensional cross product:\n$$\nA\\left(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{c}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\left[(\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{a})\\times(\\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{a})\\right]_z,\n$$\nwhere, for $\\mathbf{u}=\\left(u_x,u_y\\right)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=\\left(v_x,v_y\\right)$, the scalar cross product is $\\left[\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v}\\right]_z = u_x v_y - u_y v_x$.\n- Two line segments $\\left[\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{p}+\\mathbf{r}\\right]$ and $\\left[\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{q}+\\mathbf{s}\\right]$ intersect at parameters $t$ and $u$ satisfying $\\mathbf{p}+t\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{q}+u\\mathbf{s}$, with an intersection in the open segment occurring when $t \\in (0,1)$ and $u \\in (0,1)$ and $[\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{s}]_z \\neq 0$.\n\nDesign requirements:\n1. Given a quadrilateral $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$ in order, first determine whether it is self-intersecting (a bow-tie). If it is self-intersecting, compute the unique interior intersection point $\\mathbf{p}$ of the two crossing edges and triangulate by introducing the Steiner point $\\mathbf{p}$, producing the fan of four triangles $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{p}\\right)$, $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{p}\\right)$, $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{v}_3,\\mathbf{p}\\right)$, $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_3,\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{p}\\right)$.\n2. If the quadrilateral is simple (not self-intersecting), consider splitting it by one of its two diagonals. For a convex quadrilateral, evaluate both diagonals:\n   - Using diagonal $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_2\\right)$ gives triangles $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2\\right)$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$.\n   - Using diagonal $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$ gives triangles $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_3,\\mathbf{v}_0\\right)$.\n   Choose the diagonal that maximizes the minimum interior angle across the resulting two triangles.\n3. For a concave simple quadrilateral (exactly one reflex interior angle greater than $180^{\\circ}$), only one diagonal lies entirely inside the polygon. Identify the reflex vertex by the sign of successive cross products and restrict to the unique valid interior diagonal: if the reflex index is $0$ or $2$, use $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_2\\right)$; if it is $1$ or $3$, use $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$. This ensures the split remains within the quadrilateral.\n4. After selecting a two-triangle split as in $2$ or $3$, compute the minimum interior angle across all produced triangles. If this minimum angle is smaller than the threshold $\\Theta_{\\min}$, then introduce the centroid $\\mathbf{c}=\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1+\\mathbf{v}_2+\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)/4$ and retriangulate into four triangles $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_i,\\mathbf{v}_{i+1 \\bmod 4},\\mathbf{c}\\right)$ for $i\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$. Use this centroid fan triangulation as the final triangulation for that quadrilateral.\n5. Compute the minimum interior angle across all final triangles, in degrees. The threshold is $\\Theta_{\\min}=25.0^{\\circ}$ (angles must be expressed in degrees). A triangulation is deemed well-conditioned if this minimum angle is at least $\\Theta_{\\min}$.\n\nTest suite:\nYour program must evaluate the following five quadrilaterals. Each quadrilateral is given by its four vertices in order as planar Cartesian coordinates. All coordinates are unitless; angles must be computed and reported in degrees.\n\n- Case $1$: $\\left(\\left(0,0\\right),\\left(2,0\\right),\\left(2,1.8\\right),\\left(0,2\\right)\\right)$.\n- Case $2$: $\\left(\\left(0,0\\right),\\left(2,0\\right),\\left(0.6,0.3\\right),\\left(0,2\\right)\\right)$.\n- Case $3$: $\\left(\\left(0,0\\right),\\left(2,2\\right),\\left(0,2\\right),\\left(2,0\\right)\\right)$.\n- Case $4$: $\\left(\\left(0,0\\right),\\left(3,0.05\\right),\\left(3,0.35\\right),\\left(0,0.3\\right)\\right)$.\n- Case $5$: $\\left(\\left(0,0\\right),\\left(1.8,0.2\\right),\\left(2.0,1.6\\right),\\left(0.2,1.9\\right)\\right)$.\n\nRequired outputs per test case:\n- The number of triangles produced (integer).\n- The minimum interior angle across all produced triangles, in degrees, rounded to three decimal places.\n- A boolean indicating whether the final triangulation is well-conditioned according to $\\Theta_{\\min}=25.0^{\\circ}$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case result is a three-element list in the form `[num_triangles, min_angle_deg, is_well_conditioned]`.

The rules for handling different quadrilateral types (self-intersecting, convex, concave) are sequential and logically consistent. The rule for identifying the interior diagonal in a concave quadrilateral is geometrically sound.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational engineering. I will now proceed with a complete, reasoned solution.\n\nThe solution requires designing an algorithm that first classifies a given quadrilateral and then applies the specified triangulation rule. We will construct this algorithm from first principles. Vectors are denoted in bold, e.g., $\\mathbf{v}$, and their components are $(v_x, v_y)$.\n\n**I. Geometric Preliminaries**\n\nWe require several fundamental geometric functions.\n\n1.  **Vector Operations**: Let $\\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y)$ and $\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y)$ be two vectors.\n    -   Dot product: $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = u_x v_x + u_y v_y$.\n    -   Scalar $z$-component of the cross product: $[\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}]_z = u_x v_y - u_y v_x$.\n    -   Euclidean norm: $\\lVert \\mathbf{u} \\rVert = \\sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2}$.\n\n2.  **Triangle Interior Angles**: For a triangle with vertices $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, $\\mathbf{c}$, the interior angle at vertex $\\mathbf{b}$ is computed using the provided formula based on the dot product of the vectors forming the angle:\n    $$ \\theta_{\\mathbf{b}} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{(\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b})\\cdot(\\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{b})}{\\lVert \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}\\rVert\\,\\lVert \\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{b}\\rVert}\\right) $$\n    This function will be applied to find all three angles of a triangle by cyclically permuting the vertices. The result must be converted from radians to degrees.\n\n3.  **Line Segment Intersection**: To detect self-intersection, we must determine if two non-adjacent edges cross. Consider two line segments, one from $\\mathbf{p}_1$ to $\\mathbf{p}_2$ and another from $\\mathbf{q}_1$ to $\\mathbf{q}_2$. Let $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{p}_2 - \\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{q}_2 - \\mathbf{q}_1$. The intersection point exists if we can find parameters $t, u \\in [0, 1]$ such that $\\mathbf{p}_1 + t\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{q}_1 + u\\mathbf{s}$.\n    This is a linear system for $t$ and $u$. Using the scalar cross product, the solution is:\n    $$ t = \\frac{[(\\mathbf{q}_1 - \\mathbf{p}_1) \\times \\mathbf{s}]_z}{[\\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{s}]_z} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u = \\frac{[(\\mathbf{q}_1 - \\mathbf{p}_1) \\times \\mathbf{r}]_z}{[\\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{s}]_z} $$\n    An intersection of the open segments occurs if the denominator $[\\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{s}]_z \\neq 0$ and both $t \\in (0, 1)$ and $u \\in (0, 1)$. If an intersection is found, the intersection point is $\\mathbf{p}_{int} = \\mathbf{p}_1 + t\\mathbf{r}$.\n\n**II. Quadrilateral Analysis and Triangulation Strategy**\n\nThe core of the algorithm is a multi-step process for a given quadrilateral $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3)$.\n\n**Step 1: Self-Intersection Detection**\nA quadrilateral is self-intersecting (bow-tie) if a pair of its non-adjacent edges crosses. The two pairs of non-adjacent edges are $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1)$ with $(\\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3)$, and $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2)$ with $(\\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_0)$. We apply the line segment intersection test to the first pair. If it intersects, the quadrilateral is a bow-tie. If not, we test the second pair. If either test is positive, we proceed with the bow-tie triangulation.\n-   **Action**: If an intersection point $\\mathbf{p}$ is found, we form a fan triangulation of four triangles: $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{p})$, $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{p})$, $(\\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{p})$, and $(\\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{p})$. We then compute the minimum angle over these four triangles. This is the final triangulation for this case.\n\n**Step 2: Simple Quadrilateral Classification (Convex vs. Concave)**\nIf the quadrilateral is not self-intersecting, it is simple. We must determine if it is convex or concave. This can be done by examining the \"turn\" at each vertex.\nFirst, we establish a consistent vertex ordering (e.g., counter-clockwise, CCW) by computing the signed area of the polygon using the shoelace formula:\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} (x_i y_{i+1 \\bmod 4} - x_{i+1 \\bmod 4} y_i) $$\nIf $A<0$, we can conceptually reverse the vertex order to enforce CCW winding.\nFor a CCW-ordered polygon, the turn at vertex $\\mathbf{v}_i$ is determined by the sign of the scalar cross product of the edge vectors meeting at $\\mathbf{v}_i$: $S_i = [(\\mathbf{v}_i - \\mathbf{v}_{i-1 \\bmod 4}) \\times (\\mathbf{v}_{i+1 \\bmod 4} - \\mathbf{v}_i)]_z$.\n-   If all $S_i$ have the same sign (positive for CCW), all turns are \"left\" and the polygon is **convex**.\n-   If one $S_i$ has a different sign (negative for CCW), that vertex corresponds to a \"right\" turn and is a **reflex** vertex. The polygon is **concave**.\n\n**Step 3: Triangulation of Simple Quadrilaterals**\n-   **Concave Case**: If a reflex vertex at index $k$ is found, only one diagonal lies entirely inside the quadrilateral. This diagonal connects the reflex vertex to its opposite, i.e., $(\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{v}_{k+2 \\bmod 4})$. This is consistent with the problem statement's rule. We split the quadrilateral along this diagonal, forming two triangles: $(\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{v}_{k+1 \\bmod 4}, \\mathbf{v}_{k+2 \\bmod 4})$ and $(\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{v}_{k+2 \\bmod 4}, \\mathbf{v}_{k+3 \\bmod 4})$.\n-   **Convex Case**: Both diagonals, $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_2)$ and $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_3)$, lie inside the quadrilateral. We must evaluate both potential splits.\n    -   Split 1 (diagonal $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_2)$): yields triangles $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2)$ and $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3)$. We compute the minimum angle $\\theta_{\\min,1}$ among the six angles of these two triangles.\n    -   Split 2 (diagonal $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_3)$): yields triangles $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3)$ and $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_0)$. We compute the minimum angle $\\theta_{\\min,2}$.\n    -   The optimal choice is the one that maximizes this minimum angle. If $\\theta_{\\min,1} \\ge \\theta_{\\min,2}$, we choose Split 1; otherwise, we choose Split 2.\n\n**Step 4: Refinement based on Angle Quality**\nFor the two-triangle triangulation obtained in Step 3 (for either a concave or convex quadrilateral), we compute its minimum interior angle, $\\theta_{\\min, \\text{initial}}$.\n-   If $\\theta_{\\min, \\text{initial}} < \\Theta_{\\min} = 25.0^{\\circ}$, the triangulation is deemed of poor quality. It is discarded. A new triangulation is generated by introducing a Steiner point at the quadrilateral's centroid, $\\mathbf{c} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\mathbf{v}_0 + \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\mathbf{v}_3)$.\n-   This creates a fan of four triangles: $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{c})$, $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{c})$, $(\\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{c})$, and $(\\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{c})$. This set of four triangles becomes the final triangulation.\n-   If $\\theta_{\\min, \\text{initial}} \\ge \\Theta_{\\min}$, the initial two-triangle split is accepted as the final triangulation.\n\n**Step 5: Final Evaluation**\nOnce the final set of triangles is determined (either from Step 1, or Step 4), we perform a final analysis:\n1.  Count the number of triangles in the set.\n2.  Compute the minimum interior angle across all angles in all triangles.\n3.  Compare this final minimum angle to $\\Theta_{\\min}$ to determine if the triangulation is well-conditioned.\n\nThis structured procedure rigorously follows the problem specification and ensures a unique, principled outcome for any given planar quadrilateral. The implementation will directly map these logical steps into code.",

The points are given as permutations of the barycentric coordinate triple $(\\alpha, \\alpha, 1-2\\alpha)$. For the reference triangle with vertices $V_1=(0,0)$, $V_2=(1,0)$, and $V_3=(0,1)$, a point with barycentric coordinates $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ has Cartesian coordinates $(x,y) = (\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$.

Substituting $w=\\frac{1}{6}$:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}(6\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha + 1) $$\n        $$ \\frac{1}{2} = 6\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha + 1 \\implies 12\\alpha^2 - 8\\alpha + 2 = 1 \\implies 12\\alpha^2 - 8\\alpha + 1 = 0 $$\n    \\item For $p=y^2$: This yields the same equation as for $p=x^2$ due to symmetry.\n    \\item For $p=xy$: $\\frac{1}{24} = w(2\\alpha - 3\\alpha^2)$. Substituting $w=\\frac{1}{6}$:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{6}(2\\alpha - 3\\alpha^2) $$\n        $$ \\frac{1}{4} = 2\\alpha - 3\\alpha^2 \\implies 1 = 8\\alpha - 12\\alpha^2 \\implies 12\\alpha^2 - 8\\alpha + 1 = 0 $$\n\\end{enumerate}\nBoth second-degree monomials yield the same quadratic equation for $\\alpha$. This indicates that the assumed symmetric form of the quadrature rule is consistent. We solve this equation for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n12\\alpha^2 - 8\\alpha + 1 = 0\n$$\nFactoring the quadratic gives $(6\\alpha - 1)(2\\alpha - 1) = 0$. The solutions are $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$ and $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nBoth values are within the valid range $0 \\le \\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, two such quadrature rules exist under the given symmetry assumptions. However, both rules share the same common weight $w$.\n\nThe problem asks only for the common nodal weight $w$. As derived from the exactness condition for the polynomial $p(x,y) = 1$, this weight is uniquely determined.\n$$\n3w = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies w = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nThe existence of valid solutions for $\\alpha$ confirms that a quadrature rule with this weight and the specified symmetric structure exists.
