            "problem": "You are to implement a numerical simulator for one-dimensional transient heat conduction using the explicit Forward Time Centered Space (FTCS) scheme. Begin from the conservation of energy and Fourier’s law of heat conduction, leading to the one-dimensional heat equation for a homogeneous rod with constant thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$, and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The rod occupies $x \\in [0,L]$. The boundary temperatures are fixed at $T(0,t)=0$ and $T(L,t)=0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The initial condition is a single-mode sinusoid $T(x,0) = T_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\nYour task is to:\n- Discretize the spatial domain with a uniform grid of $N$ nodes including both boundaries, with spacing $\\Delta x = L/(N-1)$, and discretize time using a constant time step $\\Delta t$. Use the FTCS explicit scheme to update interior nodes while enforcing the boundary conditions at every time step.\n- For each provided test case, choose $\\Delta t$ to satisfy a specified nondimensional ratio $r = \\alpha \\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x^2$. The values of $r$ and all other parameters are given in the test suite below. Assume that $\\Delta t$ is chosen so that $t_{\\mathrm{end}}/\\Delta t$ is an integer. Evolve the solution from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\mathrm{end}}$.\n- At the specified node index $i_{\\star}$ (with zero-based indexing), compute the numerical temperature $T_{\\mathrm{num}}$ and the analytical temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ana}}$ for the same location and time, and return the absolute error $|T_{\\mathrm{num}} - T_{\\mathrm{ana}}|$ for each test case.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- Conservation of energy for a differential control volume combined with Fourier’s law leads to the one-dimensional transient heat equation $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$ for a homogeneous medium with constant $\\alpha$.\n- The analytical solution for the given initial and boundary conditions is given by separation of variables as a single decaying mode $T(x,t) = T_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\n- The FTCS scheme is the explicit time-stepping method that uses a forward difference in time and a centered second-order difference in space.\n\nAssumptions and requirements:\n- Use zero-based indexing for nodes $i=0,1,\\dots,N-1$, with $x_i = i\\,\\Delta x$.\n- Initialize the numerical solution as $T_i^0 = T_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x_i}{L}\\right)$ for all nodes, and enforce $T_0^n=0$ and $T_{N-1}^n=0$ for all time steps $n$.\n- For each test case, compute $\\Delta x$, then compute $\\Delta t$ from the given $r$ by $\\Delta t = r\\,\\Delta x^2/\\alpha$, and take exactly $n_{\\mathrm{steps}} = t_{\\mathrm{end}}/\\Delta t$ time steps.\n- Compute the absolute error at the specified node $i_{\\star}$ as a real number.\n\nPhysical units:\n- Express all temperatures in kelvin.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, complete, and devoid of ambiguity. A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Algorithm\n\nThe governing equation is the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nWe discretize this equation on a grid where $T_i^n$ denotes the temperature at spatial node $i$ and time step $n$. The spatial coordinates are $x_i = i\\Delta x$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, and time is $t_n = n\\Delta t$.\n\nThe FTCS scheme employs a forward difference for the time derivative and a second-order central difference for the spatial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{(x_i, t_n)} \\approx \\frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{(x_i, t_n)} \\approx \\frac{T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the heat equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\frac{T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\n\nSolving for the temperature at the next time step, $T_i^{n+1}$, gives the explicit update rule:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2} \\left( T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n \\right)\n$$\n\nIntroducing the non-dimensional diffusion number, $r = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}$, simplifies the expression:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + r \\left( T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n \\right)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged for computational efficiency:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = r T_{i-1}^n + (1 - 2r) T_i^n + r T_{i+1}^n\n$$\nThis update rule is applied to all interior nodes, i.e., for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N-2$. The boundary nodes $i=0$ and $i=N-1$ are held fixed at $0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ for all time steps, as per the Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Define the physical and numerical parameters from the test case: $L$, $\\alpha$, $T_{\\mathrm{amp}}$, $N$, $r$, $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, and $i_{\\star}$.\n2.  Calculate the grid spacing $\\Delta x = L / (N - 1)$ and the time step $\\Delta t = r \\cdot \\Delta x^2 / \\alpha$.\n3.  Calculate the total number of time steps required to reach $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, which is $n_{\\mathrm{steps}} = \\text{round}(t_{\\mathrm{end}} / \\Delta t)$. The problem statement guarantees this is an integer.\n4.  Create a spatial grid $x_i = i \\Delta x$ for $i=0, \\dots, N-1$.\n5.  Initialize the temperature array $T$ at time $t=0$ using the initial condition: $T_i = T_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\sin(\\pi x_i / L)$ for all $i$.\n6.  Begin the time-stepping loop from $n=0$ to $n_{\\mathrm{steps}}-1$:\n    a. Create a new array, $T_{\\text{new}}$, to store the temperatures at the next time step, $n+1$.\n    b. For each interior node $i$ from $1$ to $N-2$, calculate $T_{\\text{new},i}$ using the FTCS update rule: $T_{\\text{new},i} = r T_{i-1} + (1-2r) T_i + r T_{i+1}$.\n    c. Enforce the boundary conditions: $T_{\\text{new},0} = 0$ and $T_{\\text{new},N-1} = 0$.\n    d. Update the current temperature array for the next iteration: $T \\leftarrow T_{\\text{new}}$.\n7.  After the loop completes, the array $T$ contains the numerical solution at $t = t_{\\mathrm{end}}$. The numerical temperature at the specified node is $T_{\\mathrm{num}} = T_{i_{\\star}}$.\n8.  Calculate the analytical solution at the same position and time. The position is $x_{\\star} = i_{\\star} \\Delta x$.\n    $$\n    T_{\\mathrm{ana}} = T_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x_{\\star}}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t_{\\mathrm{end}}\\right)\n    $$\n9.  Compute and record the absolute error, $|T_{\\mathrm{num}} - T_{\\mathrm{ana}}|$.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for all four test cases to generate the final results.",

            "problem": "A one-dimensional species transport problem is posed on the interval $x \\in [0,L]$ with molecular diffusion only. The species concentration $c(x,t)$ obeys local conservation of mass and the Fickian constitutive relation for the diffusive flux. Initially, the concentration is nonnegative everywhere, with a sharp step near the left boundary: $c(x,0) \\ge 0$, $c(0,t)=c_{0}>0$, and $c(L,t)=0$. Consider a uniform grid of spacing $\\Delta x$ and an explicit-in-time, centered-in-space finite-volume update for $c$ at interior nodes. Let the diffusivity be $D>0$ constant. You are told that, at early times when the gradient near $x=0$ is very steep, the explicit computation yields $c<0$ at some interior nodes, even though all initial and boundary values are nonnegative.\n\nUsing only (i) the differential species balance $\\partial c/\\partial t + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J} = 0$ applied to a one-dimensional control volume and (ii) Fick’s law $\\boldsymbol{J}_{d} = -D \\nabla c$ with constant $D$, reason from first principles why such negative values can arise in an explicit scheme under steep gradients. In your reasoning, identify the non-dimensional grouping formed by $(D,\\Delta t,\\Delta x)$ that controls whether the explicit update is a convex combination of neighboring values. For the specific values $L=1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\Delta x=20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $D=1\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$, and a chosen time step $\\Delta t=0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$, evaluate this non-dimensional number and state whether the update is a convex combination. Then, select the option that best explains the appearance of negative concentrations and correctly suggests a boundedness-preserving alternative.\n\nOptions:\nA. Negative concentrations arise because, for sufficiently large $\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$, the explicit update ceases to be a convex combination of nonnegative neighbor values; with steep gradients the discrete Laplacian is large, and the forward Euler step overshoots below zero. A boundedness-preserving alternative is to either enforce $\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le 1/2$ so that the explicit weights remain nonnegative, or to use a fully implicit backward-Euler diffusion step whose coefficient matrix is an $M$-matrix satisfying a discrete maximum principle for any $\\Delta t$.\n\nB. Negative concentrations indicate that Fick’s law fails at high gradients and violates the second law; replacing it with a nonlinear constitutive relation $J=-D(c)\\,\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ with $D(c)$ increasing in $c$ unconditionally restores positivity for explicit schemes at any $\\Delta t$.\n\nC. The observed negativity is due solely to floating-point round-off; using double precision arithmetic eliminates it without changing the discretization or time step.\n\nD. Central differencing in space combined with a leapfrog time integrator for diffusion is unconditionally non-oscillatory and preserves nonnegativity for any $\\Delta t$; thus switching to leapfrog time stepping resolves the issue without changing $\\Delta t$ or the spatial stencil.",

The fluxes at the control volume faces are approximated using a centered difference scheme:\n$$ J_{i+1/2} \\approx -D \\frac{c_{i+1} - c_i}{\\Delta x} $$\n$$ J_{i-1/2} \\approx -D \\frac{c_i - c_{i-1}}{\\Delta x} $$\nSubstituting these fluxes into the semi-discretized equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{d c_i}{dt} \\Delta x = \\left(-D \\frac{c_i - c_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}\\right) - \\left(-D \\frac{c_{i+1} - c_i}{\\Delta x}\\right) = \\frac{D}{\\Delta x} (c_{i+1} - 2c_i + c_{i-1}) $$\n$$ \\frac{d c_i}{dt} = \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} (c_{i+1} - 2c_i + c_{i-1}) $$\nNow, we apply an explicit-in-time (Forward Euler) discretization to the time derivative, where the superscript $n$ denotes the time level $t=n\\Delta t$:\n$$ \\frac{c_i^{n+1} - c_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} (c_{i+1}^n - 2c_i^n + c_{i-1}^n) $$\nSolving for the concentration at the next time step, $c_i^{n+1}$:\n$$ c_i^{n+1} = c_i^n + \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} (c_{i+1}^n - 2c_i^n + c_{i-1}^n) $$\nLet us define the non-dimensional grouping $\\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$. This parameter is the grid Fourier number, or diffusion number. The update equation can be rewritten by grouping terms at the time level $n$:\n$$ c_i^{n+1} = \\alpha c_{i-1}^n + (1 - 2\\alpha) c_i^n + \\alpha c_{i+1}^n $$\nFor the updated value $c_i^{n+1}$ to be guaranteed non-negative when all values at the previous time step ($c_{j}^n$) are non-negative, the update must be a convex combination of its neighbors. This means the coefficients of $c_{j}^n$ in the expression for $c_i^{n+1}$ must be non-negative and sum to $1$. The sum of the coefficients is $\\alpha + (1-2\\alpha) + \\alpha = 1$. The non-negativity condition requires:\n1. $\\alpha \\ge 0$. Since $D>0$, $\\Delta t > 0$, and $(\\Delta x)^2 > 0$, this is always true.\n2. $1 - 2\\alpha \\ge 0$, which implies $2\\alpha \\le 1$, or $\\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the non-dimensional grouping that controls whether the update is a convex combination is $\\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$, and the condition is $\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIf this condition is violated (i.e., $\\alpha > 1/2$), the coefficient $(1-2\\alpha)$ becomes negative. In a region of steep gradients, it is possible for a node $i$ to have a high concentration $c_i^n > 0$ while its neighbors are near zero, $c_{i-1}^n \\approx 0$ and $c_{i+1}^n \\approx 0$. In this scenario, the update becomes $c_i^{n+1} \\approx (1-2\\alpha)c_i^n$. Since $c_i^n > 0$ and $(1-2\\alpha)  0$, the result $c_i^{n+1}$ will be negative. This numerical \"overshoot\" below zero is a direct consequence of the instability of the explicit scheme when the time step is too large for the given grid spacing and diffusivity.\n\n**Evaluation of the Non-dimensional Number**\nUsing the given values:\n$D = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$\n$\\Delta t = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\Delta x = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe non-dimensional number is calculated as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\times (0.5\\,\\mathrm{s})}{(2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{-9}}{4 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-10}}{4 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 $$\nThe condition for the update to be a convex combination is $\\alpha \\le 1/2$, which is $1.25 \\le 0.5$. This inequality is false. Thus, with the chosen parameters, the update is **not** a convex combination.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Negative concentrations arise because, for sufficiently large $\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$, the explicit update ceases to be a convex combination of nonnegative neighbor values; with steep gradients the discrete Laplacian is large, and the forward Euler step overshoots below zero. A boundedness-preserving alternative is to either enforce $\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le 1/2$ so that the explicit weights remain nonnegative, or to use a fully implicit backward-Euler diffusion step whose coefficient matrix is an $M$-matrix satisfying a discrete maximum principle for any $\\Delta t$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the non-dimensional group $\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$ and the critical value of $1/2$ for maintaining the convex combination property. It correctly explains the mechanism of overshoot. It also correctly proposes two standard remedies: reducing the time step to satisfy the stability condition for the explicit scheme, or switching to a fully implicit scheme, which is unconditionally stable and positivity-preserving for any $\\Delta t  0$ due to its M-matrix property. The reasoning is entirely sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Negative concentrations indicate that Fick’s law fails at high gradients and violates the second law; replacing it with a nonlinear constitutive relation $J=-D(c)\\,\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ with $D(c)$ increasing in $c$ unconditionally restores positivity for explicit schemes at any $\\Delta t$.**\nThis option incorrectly blames the physical model (Fick's law) for a numerical artifact. The diffusion PDE itself guarantees non-negativity. The proposed \"solution\" of using a nonlinear diffusivity does not remove the conditional stability of an explicit time-stepping scheme. The claim that this change \"unconditionally restores positivity... at any $\\Delta t$\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The observed negativity is due solely to floating-point round-off; using double precision arithmetic eliminates it without changing the discretization or time step.**\nThis option confuses stability error with round-off error. The negative values arise from the amplification of errors inherent to the unstable numerical scheme, resulting in values that can be orders of magnitude different from zero. This is a truncation error issue, not a precision issue. Switching from single to double precision will not stabilize a fundamentally unstable scheme.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Central differencing in space combined with a leapfrog time integrator for diffusion is unconditionally non-oscillatory and preserves nonnegativity for any $\\Delta t$; thus switching to leapfrog time stepping resolves the issue without changing $\\Delta t$ or the spatial stencil.**\nThis option suggests using the leapfrog scheme for time integration. The leapfrog scheme ($\\frac{c^{n+1}-c^{n-1}}{2\\Delta t} = \\dots$) is known to be unconditionally unstable when applied to the diffusion equation. It is suitable for hyperbolic equations (like the wave equation) but not for parabolic equations. The claim that it is \"unconditionally non-oscillatory\" for diffusion is the opposite of the truth.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

By modeling the computational cost for a \"stiff\" problem—one with vastly different scales—you will quantify how the tiny, stability-enforced time steps of an explicit method can lead to prohibitive runtimes, making the more complex implicit approach far more efficient in practice .",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is determined to be valid. It is a well-posed computational exercise in the numerical analysis of partial differential equations, grounded in established scientific and mathematical principles. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and the task is free from ambiguity, contradiction, or factual unsoundness. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of several quantities related to the computational cost and stability of explicit and implicit time-stepping schemes for the one-dimensional heat equation with piecewise constant thermal diffusivity. The governing equation is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}(x,t) = \\alpha(x)\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}(x,t)\n$$\non a spatial domain $x \\in [0,L]$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The thermal diffusivity $\\alpha(x)$ is piecewise constant.\n\nThe solution methodology involves a direct application of the formulas provided for each test case, which are specified by the tuple $(L, N, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, T_{\\mathrm{final}})$. The computational steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Discretization Parameters**: The spatial domain of length $L$ is discretized using a uniform grid of $N$ points. The grid spacing, $h$, is the distance between adjacent points and is calculated as $h = L / (N-1)$. The number of interior grid points, $M$, subject to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, is $M = N-2$.\n\n2.  **Maximum Explicit Time Step ($\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{exp},\\max}$)**: The forward Euler scheme applied to the centered finite-difference spatial discretization of the heat equation is only conditionally stable. The stability is governed by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. For the 1D heat equation, this condition is $\\alpha \\Delta t / h^2 \\le 1/2$. In the presence of spatially varying diffusivity, a conservative stability criterion uses the maximum diffusivity value over the domain. Thus, the maximum stable time step is given by the formula:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{exp},\\max} = \\frac{h^2}{2\\,\\max(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)}\n    $$\n    This value represents the largest time step for which the explicit numerical solution is guaranteed not to exhibit unbounded growth.\n\n3.  **Number of Explicit Steps ($N_{\\mathrm{exp}}$)**: To simulate up to a final time $T_{\\mathrm{final}}$ using the maximum stable time step, the required number of steps, $N_{\\mathrm{exp}}$, is determined by dividing the total simulation time by the step size and taking the ceiling of the result. This ensures the simulation time reaches or exceeds $T_{\\mathrm{final}}$.\n    $$\n    N_{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{final}}}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{exp},\\max}} \\right\\rceil\n    $$\n\n4.  **Total Explicit Cost ($C_{\\mathrm{exp}}$)**: The computational cost is modeled as a count of floating-point operations. Given a cost of $6M$ operations per time step for the explicit method, the total cost to reach $T_{\\mathrm{final}}$ is the product of the per-step cost and the number of steps:\n    $$\n    C_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 6 \\cdot M \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{exp}}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Implicit Method Costs**: The backward Euler method is unconditionally stable, meaning the time step size is not constrained by stability but rather by accuracy considerations.\n    - The cost per step, $C_{\\mathrm{imp,step}}$, is given as $8M$. This reflects the cost of solving the $M \\times M$ symmetric tridiagonal linear system that arises at each implicit step, for instance, using the Thomas algorithm.\n      $$\n      C_{\\mathrm{imp,step}} = 8 \\cdot M\n      $$\n    - To provide a direct comparison with the explicit method, the total cost of the implicit method using the *same number of steps* as the explicit method, $N_{\\mathrm{exp}}$, is calculated as:\n      $$\n      C_{\\mathrm{imp,same}} = 8 \\cdot M \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{exp}}\n      $$\n    - The theoretical minimal cost for the implicit method, $C_{\\mathrm{imp,min}}$, corresponds to advancing the solution from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\mathrm{final}}$ in a single time step. While this would yield a solution with very large temporal error, it represents the lower bound on computational cost.\n      $$\n      C_{\\mathrm{imp,min}} = 8 \\cdot M\n      $$\n\nThese calculations are performed for each of the three test cases provided in the problem statement.
