This problem is a model for the motion of a unit-mass particle in a quartic potential $V(y)=\\tfrac{1}{4}y^4$, with $x$ playing the role of time. From first principles in classical mechanics and ordinary differential equations, do the following.\n\n1) Starting from Newton's second law and the definition of mechanical energy for a unit mass, use the potential $V(y)=\\tfrac{1}{4}y^4$ to justify that the initial value problem with initial conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=s$ conserves the energy\n$$\nE = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,[y'(x)]^2 + \\tfrac{1}{4}\\, [y(x)]^4,\n$$\nand that, for $s0$, the solution $y(x)$ is periodic in $x$ and oscillates between symmetric turning points $\\pm A$ determined by the energy. Then, using only these fundamental facts (without invoking any pre-derived period formulas), argue qualitatively why the boundary value problem can admit multiple distinct solutions for a fixed $L$: different choices of the initial slope $s$ can produce trajectories in which one or more half-oscillations fit exactly into the interval $[0,L]$, all satisfying the same final boundary condition $y(L)=0$.\n\n2) Implement a shooting method to reveal this non-uniqueness numerically.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in computational physics and nonlinear dynamics concerning the solution of a boundary value problem (BVP) for a conservative system. All necessary data, equations, and constraints are provided. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: first, a theoretical justification from first principles, and second, a description of the numerical shooting method designed to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Theoretical Justification and Qualitative Analysis**\n\nThe problem concerns the motion of a particle of unit mass, $m=1$, under the influence of a force $F(y)$ derived from a potential energy function $V(y)$. Newton's second law states that $ma = F$, where the acceleration is $a = y''(x)$, with $x$ representing time. The force is conservative, given by $F(y) = -V'(y)$. For the given potential $V(y) = \\frac{1}{4}y^4$, the corresponding force is $F(y) = -\\frac{d}{dy}(\\frac{1}{4}y^4) = -y^3$. Substituting these into Newton's law for $m=1$ gives:\n$$\n(1) y''(x) = -y(x)^3\n$$\nwhich rearranges to the specified ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\ny''(x) + y(x)^3 = 0.\n$$\nThis confirms the physical origin of the governing equation.\n\nTo demonstrate the conservation of mechanical energy, we multiply the ODE by the velocity, $y'(x)$:\n$$\ny''(x) y'(x) + y(x)^3 y'(x) = 0.\n$$\nThis expression is equivalent to the total time derivative of the energy. Recognizing that $y'' y' = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{1}{2}[y'(x)]^2)$ and $y^3 y' = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{1}{4}[y(x)]^4)$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}[y'(x)]^2 + \\frac{1}{4}[y(x)]^4 \\right) = 0.\n$$\nThis implies that the quantity within the parentheses, which is the total mechanical energy $E$, is a constant of motion:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2}[y'(x)]^2 + \\frac{1}{4}[y(x)]^4 = \\text{constant}.\n$$\nThe energy $E$ is determined by the initial conditions. For the initial value problem (IVP) with $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=s$, the energy is:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2}[y'(0)]^2 + \\frac{1}{4}[y(0)]^4 = \\frac{1}{2}s^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(0)^4 = \\frac{1}{2}s^2.\n$$\nFor any $s > 0$, the energy $E > 0$. The particle's motion is confined by the potential. The turning points of the oscillation, denoted $\\pm A$, occur where the velocity $y'(x)$ is zero. At these points, the kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential: $E = V(A) = \\frac{1}{4}A^4$. Equating the two expressions for energy gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}s^2 = \\frac{1}{4}A^4 \\implies A = (2s^2)^{1/4}.\n$$\nThe particle starts at $y(0)=0$ with positive velocity $s$, moves towards the positive turning point $+A$, reverses direction, passes through $y=0$ with velocity $-s$, reaches the negative turning point $-A$, and returns to $y=0$. This cycle constitutes a periodic motion.\n\nThe non-uniqueness of solutions for the BVP arises from the periodic nature of the IVP solutions. The boundary condition $y(L)=0$ requires the particle to be at the origin at time $x=L$. Starting from $y(0)=0$, the particle reaches $y=0$ again after one half-period, two half-periods (a full period), three half-periods, and so on. Let $T_{1/2}(s)$ denote the half-period of the oscillation corresponding to the initial slope $s$. The boundary condition $y(L)=0$ is satisfied if the interval length $L$ is an integer multiple of the half-period:\n$$\nL = k \\cdot T_{1/2}(s) \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nThe period of this anharmonic oscillator depends on its energy, and therefore on $s$. By changing $s$, we change the period. For a fixed length $L$, the above equation becomes an implicit equation for $s$. It is plausible that this equation can be solved for different values of $s$, each corresponding to a different integer $k$. For $k=1$, we seek an initial slope $s_1$ such that the particle just completes its first half-oscillation in the interval $[0, L]$. This yields the fundamental solution, a single arch. For $k=2$, we seek a different slope $s_2$ such that the particle completes two half-oscillations (one full wave) in $[0, L]$. These distinct values $s_1, s_2, \\dots$ all produce solutions $y(x; s_k)$ that satisfy both boundary conditions, $y(0)=0$ and $y(L)=0$, thus explaining the existence of multiple, non-trivial solutions to the BVP.\n\n**2. Numerical Design: The Shooting Method**\n\nTo find these distinct initial slopes numerically, we employ the shooting method. This method reframes the BVP as a root-finding problem.\n\nThe shooting parameter is the unknown initial slope, $s = y'(0)$.\nThe IVP is defined as:\n$$\ny''(x) + y(x)^3 = 0, \\quad y(0)=0, \\quad y'(0)=s.\n$$\nTo solve this numerically, we convert the second-order ODE into an equivalent first-order system. Let $y_1(x) = y(x)$ and $y_2(x) = y'(x)$. The system is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\ny_1'(x) = y_2(x) \\\\\ny_2'(x) = -y_1(x)^3\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith initial conditions at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} y_1(0) \\\\ y_2(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ s \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nWe integrate this system from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The solution at $x=L$, which we denote $y(L;s)$, depends on the choice of $s$. The second boundary condition $y(L)=0$ (or $y_1(L)=0$) is satisfied only for specific values of $s$. We define a residual function $R(s;L)$ which measures the mismatch at the final boundary:\n$$\nR(s;L) = y_1(L;s).\n$$\nThe problem is now to find the roots of the equation $R(s;L) = 0$.\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Residual Function**: Create a function that, for a given $s$ and $L$, numerically solves the IVP from $x=0$ to $x=L$ using a high-precision, adaptive-step ODE integrator (such as `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` with absolute and relative tolerances set to $10^{-10}$). This function returns the value of $y_1(L)$.\n2.  **Bracket the Roots**: As argued qualitatively, the residual $R(s;L)$ will be an oscillatory function of $s$. To find its roots, we first need to isolate them in intervals. We achieve this by evaluating $R(s;L)$ over a grid of $s$ values and identifying pairs of adjacent points, $(s_a, s_b)$, where $R(s_a;L)$ and $R(s_b;L)$ have opposite signs. Each such interval $[s_a, s_b]$ is guaranteed to contain at least one root.\n3.  **Solve for the Roots**: For each bracket $[s_a, s_b]$ found, a robust one-dimensional bracketing root-finder (such as Brent's method, `scipy.optimize.brentq`) is used to locate the root $s_k$ to a high degree of accuracy (tolerance on $s$ set to $10^{-11}$).\n4.  **Collect and Report**: We apply this procedure for each given length $L_i$ to find the two smallest distinct positive roots, $s_{1}(L_i)$ and $s_{2}(L_i)$, round them to the specified precision, and format the output as required. The trivial solution $s=0$ is explicitly excluded.\n\nThis combination of a high-fidelity ODE solver and a reliable root-finding algorithm provides a robust and accurate method for determining the non-unique solutions of the nonlinear BVP.",

Thus, the initial condition for the IVP is:\n    $$z(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} y(0) \\\\ y'(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ s \\end{bmatrix}$$\n    We solve this IVP from $x=0$ to $x=1$. The solution, which depends on $s$, is denoted $z(x;s)$.\n    The shooting method seeks a value of $s$ such that the second BC, $y(1) + (y'(1))^2 = 1$, is satisfied. This BC translates to $z_1(1;s) + (z_2(1;s))^2 = 1$.\n    The scalar residual function $R(s)$ is defined such that its root, $R(s)=0$, satisfies this condition:\n    $$R(s) = z_1(1;s) + (z_2(1;s))^2 - 1$$\n\n3.  **Sensitivity Analysis:**\n    To solve $R(s)=0$ with a Newton-Raphson method, we need the derivative $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s$.\n    Let $w(x) = \\frac{\\partial z(x;s)}{\\partial s} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\partial z_1(x;s)/\\partial s \\\\ \\partial z_2(x;s)/\\partial s \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} w_1(x) \\\\ w_2(x) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    Applying the chain rule to $R(s)$:\n    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\frac{\\partial z_1(1;s)}{\\partial s} + 2 z_2(1;s) \\frac{\\partial z_2(1;s)}{\\partial s} = w_1(1) + 2 z_2(1;s) w_2(1)$$\n    The sensitivity vector $w(x)$ is found by differentiating the ODE system $z'(x;s) = f(x, z(x;s))$ with respect to $s$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\left( z'(x;s) \\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial z(x;s)}{\\partial s} \\right) = w'(x)$$\n    $$w'(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} f(x, z(x;s)) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}(x, z(x;s)) \\frac{\\partial z(x;s)}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}(x, z(x;s)) w(x)$$\n    The Jacobian matrix $\\partial f / \\partial z$ is:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z_1}  \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial z_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z_1}  \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial z_2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n    The initial condition for $w(x)$ is found by differentiating the initial condition for $z(x;s)$:\n    $$w(0) = \\frac{\\partial z(0;s)}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ s \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n    Thus, the sensitivity IVP is $w'(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{bmatrix} w(x)$ with $w(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**Part (ii): Two-Segment Multiple Shooting Method**\n\n1.  **Unknowns:**\n    The domain $[0,1]$ is split into $[0,c]$ and $[c,1]$.\n    - For the first segment $[0,c]$, we have the IVP $z'(x) = f(x,z)$ with $z(0)=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ s \\end{bmatrix}$. The unknown is $s$.\n    - For the second segment $[c,1]$, we define a new initial state at the interface $x=c$, which is unknown. Let this state be $q = \\begin{bmatrix} q_1 \\\\ q_2 \\end{bmatrix}$. This gives two more unknowns, $q_1$ and $q_2$.\n    The total vector of unknowns is $u = \\begin{bmatrix} s \\\\ q_1 \\\\ q_2 \\end{bmatrix}$, which is a vector of size $3$.\n\n2.  **Residuals:**\n    We need $3$ equations to solve for the $3$ unknowns.\n    - **Continuity at $x=c$:** The solution from the first segment at $x=c$, denoted $z(c;s)$, must be equal to the initial state of the second segment, $q$. This provides two equations:\n        $F_1(u) = z_1(c;s) - q_1 = 0$\n        $F_2(u) = z_2(c;s) - q_2 = 0$\n    - **Terminal Condition at $x=1$:** The solution of the second segment, denoted $\\tilde{z}(x;q)$, which solves $\\tilde{z}'=f(x,\\tilde{z})$ with $\\tilde{z}(c)=q$, must satisfy the terminal BC.\n        $\\tilde{z}_1(1;q) + (\\tilde{z}_2(1;q))^2 - 1 = 0$\n        This gives the third equation: $F_3(u) = \\tilde{z}_1(1;q) + (\\tilde{z}_2(1;q))^2 - 1 = 0$.\n    The complete residual vector is:\n    $$F(u) = \\begin{bmatrix} z_1(c;s) - q_1 \\\\ z_2(c;s) - q_2 \\\\ \\tilde{z}_1(1;q) + (\\tilde{z}_2(1;q))^2 - 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    - **Single Shooting:** The residual $R(s)$, the ODE system function $f(x,z)$, the sensitivity IVP (equation, Jacobian, and initial condition), and the expression for $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s$ all match the derivation exactly.\n    - **Multiple Shooting:** The unknown vector $u$ and the residual vector $F(u)$ also match the derivation perfectly.\n    - **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    - **Single Shooting:** The residual $R(s) = z_1(1;s) - 1$ is incorrect; it corresponds to a different BC, $y(1)=1$. The sensitivity initial condition $w(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ is incorrect; it would correspond to shooting on $y(0)$, but the parameter is $s=y'(0)$.\n    - **Multiple Shooting:** The unknown vector $u = \\begin{bmatrix} s \\\\ q_1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is incomplete. It arbitrarily fixes the second state variable at the interface, $z_2(c)=0$, which is unjustified. The system is ill-posed as it has fewer unknowns and equations than required.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    - **Single Shooting:** The residual $R(s) = z_1(1;s) + z_2(1;s) - 1$ is incorrect; it corresponds to a linear BC $y(1)+y'(1)=1$. The sensitivity ODE is given as non-homogeneous, which is fundamentally wrong. The sensitivity ODE for a parameter-independent $f$ must be linear and homogeneous, $w'=Jw$.\n    - **Multiple Shooting:** The residual vector uses a squared norm for continuity, $(\\dots)^2+(\\dots)^2=0$, which reduces two required equations to one, making the system underdetermined. It also includes an arbitrary condition $q_2=0$. The formulation is entirely flawed.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    - **Single Shooting:** The Jacobian matrix for the sensitivity equation is given as $\\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{bmatrix}$, which is incorrect. The correct Jacobian is $\\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The sensitivity initial condition $w(0)=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is also incorrect due to the wrong sign.\n    - **Multiple Shooting:** The unknown vector $u$ incorrectly includes $y_0=y(0)$ as a variable. Since $y(0)=0$ is a given fixed value, it should not be part of the unknown vector in a standard formulation.\n    - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, only Option A provides a completely correct and consistent formulation for both the single and multiple shooting methods as applied to the given boundary value problem.",

Boundary conditions in engineering and physics are not always simple values at a point; they can involve integrals, derivatives, or other complex functionals of the solution.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a solvable linear boundary value problem (BVP). An analytical solution is not only possible but superior to numerical approximations for this class of problem.\n\nThe task is to find the initial slope $s = y'(a)$ for the solution $y(x)$ to the BVP defined by:\n1.  Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE): $y''(x) - k\\,y(x) = 0$ on the interval $x \\in [a,b]$.\n2.  Initial Condition: $y(a) = 0$.\n3.  Integral Condition: $\\int_{a}^{b} y(x)\\,dx = C$.\n\nThe ODE is a linear, homogeneous, second-order equation with constant coefficients. The initial conditions are $y(a)=0$ and $y'(a)=s$. Due to the linearity of the ODE and the initial conditions, the solution of this initial value problem (IVP), let us denote it $y(x; s)$, must be directly proportional to the parameter $s$. That is, $y(x; s) = s \\cdot y(x; 1)$, where $y(x; 1)$ is the solution for the specific case where the initial slope is $1$.\n\nSubstituting this linear form into the integral condition provides a simple algebraic equation for $s$:\n$$ \\int_{a}^{b} s \\cdot y(x; 1)\\,dx = C $$\n$$ s \\left( \\int_{a}^{b} y(x; 1)\\,dx \\right) = C $$\nThis equation can be solved for $s$, provided the integral term is non-zero.\n$$ s = \\frac{C}{\\int_{a}^{b} y(x; 1)\\,dx} $$\nThe specific form of the solution $y(x)$ depends on the sign of the parameter $k$. We must analyze three distinct cases.\n\n**Case 1: $k > 0$**\nLet $\\omega = \\sqrt{k}$. The general solution to the ODE $y''(x) - \\omega^2 y(x) = 0$ is $y(x) = A_1 \\cosh(\\omega(x-a)) + A_2 \\sinh(\\omega(x-a))$.\nApplying the initial conditions:\n$y(a) = 0 \\implies A_1 \\cosh(0) + A_2 \\sinh(0) = A_1 = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $y(x) = A_2 \\sinh(\\omega(x-a))$.\nThe derivative is $y'(x) = A_2 \\omega \\cosh(\\omega(x-a))$.\n$y'(a) = s \\implies A_2 \\omega \\cosh(0) = A_2 \\omega = s \\implies A_2 = s/\\omega$.\nThus, the solution to the IVP is:\n$$ y(x; s) = \\frac{s}{\\omega} \\sinh(\\omega(x-a)) $$\nNow, we apply the integral condition:\n$$ \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{s}{\\omega} \\sinh(\\omega(x-a))\\,dx = C $$\n$$ \\frac{s}{\\omega} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\cosh(\\omega(x-a)) \\right]_{a}^{b} = C $$\n$$ \\frac{s}{\\omega^2} \\left( \\cosh(\\omega(b-a)) - \\cosh(0) \\right) = C $$\n$$ \\frac{s}{k} \\left( \\cosh(\\sqrt{k}(b-a)) - 1 \\right) = C $$\nSince $ba$ and $k0$, the argument of the hyperbolic cosine is positive, so $\\cosh(\\sqrt{k}(b-a)) > 1$. The denominator is never zero. Solving for $s$:\n$$ s = \\frac{kC}{\\cosh(\\sqrt{k}(b-a)) - 1} $$\n\n**Case 2: $k = 0$**\nThe ODE becomes $y''(x) = 0$.

If the denominator is zero and $C=0$, the integral condition is satisfied for any value of $s$, leading to infinitely many solutions. In this scenario, the problem states the convention is to return $s=0$. If the denominator is zero and $C \\neq 0$, no solution exists. The problem statement guarantees this case will not occur.
