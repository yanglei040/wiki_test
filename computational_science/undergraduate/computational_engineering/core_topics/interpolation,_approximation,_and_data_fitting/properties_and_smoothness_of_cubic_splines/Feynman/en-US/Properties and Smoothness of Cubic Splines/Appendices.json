Let $M_i = S''(x_i)$ be the second derivative of the spline at knot $x_i$. For a natural cubic spline, the boundary conditions are $M_0 = S''(x_0)=0$ and $M_n=S''(x_n)=0$. In this problem, $n=3$, so $M_0=0$ and $M_3=0$.\n\nThe knots are equally spaced with a step size of $h = x_{i+1} - x_i = 1$. The continuity of the first derivative $S'(x)$ at the interior knots $x_1$ and $x_2$ imposes constraints on the values of $M_i$. For equally spaced knots, this relationship is given by the following system of linear equations:\n$$M_{i-1} + 4M_i + M_{i+1} = \\frac{6}{h^2}(y_{i+1} - 2y_i + y_{i-1})$$\nWith $h=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$M_{i-1} + 4M_i + M_{i+1} = 6(y_{i+1} - 2y_i + y_{i-1})$$\nWe apply this formula for the interior knots, $i=1$ and $i=2$.\n\nFor $i=1$:\n$M_0 + 4M_1 + M_2 = 6(y_2 - 2y_1 + y_0)$\nSubstituting the given values $M_0=0$, $y_0=0$, $y_1=2$, $y_2=1$:\n$0 + 4M_1 + M_2 = 6(1 - 2(2) + 0) = 6(-3) = -18$\n$$4M_1 + M_2 = -18 \\quad (1)$$\n\nFor $i=2$:\n$M_1 + 4M_2 + M_3 = 6(y_3 - 2y_2 + y_1)$\nSubstituting the given values $M_3=0$, $y_1=2$, $y_2=1$, $y_3=2$:\n$M_1 + 4M_2 + 0 = 6(2 - 2(1) + 2) = 6(2) = 12$\n$$M_1 + 4M_2 = 12 \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe solve the system of linear equations for $M_1$ and $M_2$:\nFrom equation (2), $M_1 = 12 - 4M_2$.

Your program must:\n- Construct the baseline cubic polynomial design matrix with columns $[1, x, x^2, x^3]$ and compute $\\mathrm{RSS}_0$.\n- For each candidate $\\tau$, construct the augmented design matrix with columns $[1, x, x^2, x^3, (x-\\tau)_+^3]$ and compute $\\mathrm{RSS}(\\tau)$.\n- Select $\\tau^\\star$ as the smallest candidate $\\tau$ that achieves the minimal $\\mathrm{RSS}(\\tau)$ within a tolerance (use a fixed absolute tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$ on $\\mathrm{RSS}$ differences).\n- Output $\\tau^\\star$ for each test case.\n\nFundamental base and properties to use:\n- A cubic polynomial has continuous first and second derivatives everywhere.\n- The truncated power function $(x-\\tau)_+^3$ and its first and second derivatives vanish for $x\\le \\tau$ and are cubic, quadratic, and linear functions for $x>\\tau$, respectively. Therefore, $s(x;\\boldsymbol{\\theta},\\tau)$ is $C^2$-continuous at $x=\\tau$.\n- Ordinary least squares projection onto a linear model subspace minimizes the sum of squared residuals.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (happy path, knot in the middle). Use $m=11$ with\n  $x = [\\,0.0,\\,0.1,\\,0.2,\\,0.3,\\,0.4,\\,0.5,\\,0.6,\\,0.7,\\,0.8,\\,0.9,\\,1.0\\,]$,\n  and define\n  $y_i = x_i^3 + (x_i-0.5)_+^3$ for each $i$. This is exactly representable by the model with the true knot at $\\tau=0.5$.\n- Case $2$ (tie case, data are exactly cubic). Use $m=11$ with\n  $x = [\\,0.0,\\,0.1,\\,0.2,\\,0.3,\\,0.4,\\,0.5,\\,0.6,\\,0.7,\\,0.8,\\,0.9,\\,1.0\\,]$,\n  and\n  $y_i = x_i^3 - 2 x_i$. The baseline cubic fits exactly, so $\\mathrm{RSS}_0=0$. All candidate knots yield the same minimal residual (up to numerical tolerance). Your tie-breaking rule should return $\\tau^\\star=0.1$ (the smallest interior abscissa).\n- Case $3$ (nonuniform grid, off-center knot). Use $m=12$ with\n  $x = [\\,0.0,\\,0.05,\\,0.1,\\,0.15,\\,0.2,\\,0.25,\\,0.3,\\,0.4,\\,0.55,\\,0.7,\\,0.85,\\,1.0\\,]$,\n  and\n  $y_i = 2 x_i^3 + 5 (x_i-0.25)_+^3$. This is exactly representable by the model with the true knot at $\\tau=0.25$.\n\nAngle units are not involved. There are no physical units in this problem.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each $\\tau^\\star$ formatted as a decimal number rounded to exactly $6$ decimal places (for example, $[0.500000,0.100000,0.250000]$). The order must correspond to Cases $1$, $2$, and $3$ respectively.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the theory of regression splines and linear algebra, it is well-posed with a clear objective and constraints, and it is objective in its formulation. All necessary data and definitions are provided. I will now present the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the optimal location $\\tau^\\star$ for a single interior knot in a $C^2$-continuous cubic regression spline. The criterion for optimality is the minimization of the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). The search for $\\tau^\\star$ is restricted to a discrete set of candidate locations, which are the interior abscissae of the given data set $\\{ (x_i, y_i) \\}_{i=1}^m$.\n\nThe model for the spline function $s(x)$ with a knot at $\\tau$ is given by the truncated power basis representation:\n$$\ns(x; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\tau) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\beta_3 x^3 + \\gamma (x - \\tau)_+^3\n$$\nwhere $(x - \\tau)_+^3 = \\max\\{0, x - \\tau\\}^3$. The coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\gamma)^T$ are determined by minimizing the RSS for a given knot $\\tau$. This is a linear least squares problem.\n\nFor a set of $m$ data points, we can express the model in matrix-vector form as $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}(\\tau)\\boldsymbol{\\theta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, where $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is the vector of observed responses $y_i$, $\\mathbf{X}(\\tau) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 5}$ is the design matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$ is the vector of coefficients, and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is the vector of errors.\n\nThe design matrix $\\mathbf{X}(\\tau)$ depends on the chosen knot $\\tau$. Its $i$-th row corresponds to the data point $x_i$:\n$$\n[\\mathbf{X}(\\tau)]_{i,:} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_i & x_i^2 & x_i^3 & (x_i - \\tau)_+^3 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimate $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ for the coefficients minimizes the RSS, defined as $\\mathrm{RSS}(\\tau) = \\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}(\\tau)\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\|_2^2$. The solution to this minimization problem is given by solving the normal equations:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{X}(\\tau)^T \\mathbf{X}(\\tau)) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\mathbf{X}(\\tau)^T \\mathbf{y}\n$$\nThe minimal sum of squared residuals for a given $\\tau$ is then:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RSS}(\\tau) = \\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}(\\tau)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\|_2^2\n$$\nNumerically, it is preferable to solve for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ and compute the RSS using robust linear algebra routines, such as those based on QR decomposition, rather than by explicitly forming and inverting $\\mathbf{X}(\\tau)^T \\mathbf{X}(\\tau)$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to find the optimal knot $\\tau^\\star$ is as follows:\n$1$. For a given data set $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$ of size $m$, identify the set of candidate knots $\\mathcal{T} = \\{x_2, x_3, \\dots, x_{m-1}\\}$.\n$2$. For each candidate knot $\\tau_k \\in \\mathcal{T}$:\n    a. Construct the $m \\times 5$ design matrix $\\mathbf{X}(\\tau_k)$.\n    b. Solve the linear least squares problem to find the RSS, which we denote $\\mathrm{RSS}(\\tau_k)$. This value is obtained directly from a standard numerical solver for linear least squares.\n$3$. After computing $\\mathrm{RSS}(\\tau_k)$ for all $\\tau_k \\in \\mathcal{T}$, find the minimum value:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RSS}_{\\min} = \\min_{\\tau_k \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\mathrm{RSS}(\\tau_k)\n$$\n$4$. Identify the set of all candidate knots that achieve this minimum RSS within a specified numerical tolerance, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}_{\\min} = \\{ \\tau_k \\in \\mathcal{T} \\mid \\mathrm{RSS}(\\tau_k) \\le \\mathrm{RSS}_{\\min} + \\varepsilon \\}\n$$\n$5$. Apply the tie-breaking rule by selecting the smallest knot from this set:\n$$\n\\tau^\\star = \\min(\\mathcal{T}_{\\min})\n$$\nThis procedure is deterministic and guarantees a unique solution $\\tau^\\star$ for any given data set. The provided test cases are designed to verify the correct implementation of this logic, including cases where the data is perfectly representable by the model for a specific knot and cases requiring the tie-breaking rule. The accompanying program implements this algorithm directly.",
