The number of distinct data points is $n+1 = 4$, which corresponds to the existence of a unique interpolating polynomial of degree at most $n=3$. The data is self-contained, consistent, and requires no external information. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem rests on the uniqueness theorem of polynomial interpolation. This theorem states that for a set of $n+1$ distinct points $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=0}^n$, there exists a single, unique polynomial of degree at most $n$ that passes through every point in the set.\n\nIn this problem, we are given $n+1 = 4$ distinct input locations $x_0 = -1$, $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 2$, and $x_3 = 3$. The corresponding output values $y_i$ are generated from a known polynomial model $P(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5$.\nThe data points are therefore:\n- $(x_0, y_0) = (-1, P(-1)) = (-1, (-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 + 5) = (-1, -1 - 2 + 5) = (-1, 2)$\n- $(x_1, y_1) = (0, P(0)) = (0, (0)^3 - 2(0)^2 + 5) = (0, 5)$\n- $(x_2, y_2) = (2, P(2)) = (2, (2)^3 - 2(2)^2 + 5) = (2, 8 - 8 + 5) = (2, 5)$\n- $(x_3, y_3) = (3, P(3)) = (3, (3)^3 - 2(3)^2 + 5) = (3, 27 - 18 + 5) = (3, 14)$\n\nThe problem states that $L(x)$ is the unique degree-$3$ polynomial that interpolates these four points. The degree of the given polynomial $P(x)$ is $3$. By its very construction, $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$ that passes through all four data points.\n\nAccording to the uniqueness theorem, there can only be one such polynomial of degree at most $3$. Therefore, the Lagrange interpolating polynomial $L(x)$ must be identical to the original polynomial $P(x)$ for all values of $x$.\n$$L(x) \\equiv P(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5$$\nThis insight makes constructing the Lagrange basis polynomials, a computationally intensive task, entirely unnecessary. The problem is reduced to a simple evaluation of the polynomial $P(x)$ at the specified point.\n\nWe are asked to compute $L\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Since $L(x) = P(x)$, we compute $P\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n$$L\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = P\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 5$$\nWe evaluate this expression term by term:\n$$L\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8} - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 5$$\n$$L\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{2}{4} + 5$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator, which is $8$:\n$$L\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{40}{8}$$\n$$L\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1 - 4 + 40}{8}$$\n$$L\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{37}{8}$$\nThe exact value is $\\frac{37}{8}$.",

            "introduction": "Having established the power of unique interpolation, we now explore a critical limitation. This problem presents a scenario where polynomial interpolation, despite being mathematically correct, yields a result that completely misrepresents the underlying function.

Let $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and let the equispaced interpolation nodes be $x_k = k$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, N$. Define $P_N(x)$ to be the unique polynomial of degree at most $N$ that interpolates $f(x)$ at these nodes in the Lagrange form. Determine $P_N(x)$ as a single closed-form analytic expression. Provide your final answer as a single expression. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the unique polynomial $P_N(x)$ of degree at most $N$, which interpolates the function $f(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ at the $N+1$ integer nodes $x_k = k$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, N$. The polynomial is to be expressed in a single closed-form analytic expression.\n\nThe condition for polynomial interpolation is that the polynomial must match the function value at each interpolation node. That is, for each $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$, the following must hold:\n$$P_N(x_k) = f(x_k)$$\n\nFirst, we must evaluate the function $f(x)$ at the specified nodes $x_k = k$. The value of the function at the $k$-th node is denoted by $y_k$:\n$$y_k = f(x_k) = f(k) = \\sin(2\\pi k)$$\nFor any integer value of $k$, the argument of the sine function, $2\\pi k$, is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. The sine function is zero for all integer multiples of $\\pi$, and thus specifically for all integer multiples of $2\\pi$.\n$$y_k = \\sin(2\\pi k) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$$\n\nConsequently, the interpolation conditions for the polynomial $P_N(x)$ are:\n$$P_N(0) = 0$$\n$$P_N(1) = 0$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n$$P_N(N) = 0$$\nThis set of conditions implies that the polynomial $P_N(x)$ has $N+1$ distinct roots at $x = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe problem states that $P_N(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $N$. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a non-zero polynomial of degree $d$ has at most $d$ roots in the complex plane. If the polynomial $P_N(x)$ were non-zero, its degree, which is at most $N$, would be less than the number of its roots, which is $N+1$. This is a contradiction.\n\nThe only polynomial that can have more roots than its degree is the zero polynomial, $P_N(x) \\equiv 0$. The degree of the zero polynomial is conventionally defined as $-\\infty$ or $-1$, which satisfies the condition of being at most $N$ for any $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, the unique polynomial of degree at most $N$ that satisfies the $N+1$ interpolation conditions is the zero polynomial.\n\nThis conclusion can be formally verified using the Lagrange form of the interpolating polynomial, which is given by:\n$$P_N(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} y_j L_j(x)$$\nwhere $y_j = f(x_j)$ and $L_j(x)$ are the Lagrange basis polynomials defined as:\n$$L_j(x) = \\prod_{\\substack{k=0 \\\\ k \\ne j}}^{N} \\frac{x-x_k}{x_j-x_k}$$\nAs established, $y_j = 0$ for all $j=0, 1, \\dots, N$. Substituting these values into the Lagrange formula, we obtain:\n$$P_N(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} (0) \\cdot L_j(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} 0 = 0$$\nThis rigorously confirms that the interpolating polynomial is identically zero. The phenomenon demonstrated here is a classic example of aliasing, where the sampling rate is insufficient to capture the behavior of the oscillating function between the nodes.\n\nThe required single closed-form analytic expression for $P_N(x)$ is simply $0$.",

The use of a linear polynomial to approximate a temperature field over a small triangular element is a fundamental and standard technique in computational heat transfer and finite element analysis. It is a well-posed problem: three non-collinear points $(x_i, y_i)$ with corresponding values $T_i$ uniquely define a plane $T(x,y) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y$. The vertices $V_1=(0,0)$, $V_2=(2,1)$, and $V_3=(1,3)$ are not collinear, as the vector $\\vec{V_1V_2}=(2,1)$ is not parallel to $\\vec{V_1V_3}=(1,3)$. The problem is objective, providing all necessary data in a clear and unambiguous manner. It contains no scientific flaws, contradictions, or missing information.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem states that the temperature field $T(x,y)$ within the triangular patch is given by a first-degree polynomial that interpolates the temperatures at the three vertices. This is the two-dimensional Lagrange interpolant for a linear triangular element.\n\nThe interpolated temperature at any point $(x,y)$ inside the triangle can be expressed using barycentric coordinates, which serve as the Lagrange basis functions for a triangular element. The temperature $T(P)$ at a point $P=(x,y)$ is given by a weighted average of the vertex temperatures:\n$$T(P) = N_1(P)T_1 + N_2(P)T_2 + N_3(P)T_3$$\nwhere $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ are the temperatures at vertices $V_1$, $V_2$, and $V_3$ respectively. The functions $N_i(P)$ are the basis functions (or shape functions), which are the barycentric coordinates of the point $P$. These functions are linear in $x$ and $y$ and satisfy the property $N_i(V_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe barycentric coordinates $(N_1, N_2, N_3)$ for a point $P$ are defined by the vector equation:\n$$P = N_1 V_1 + N_2 V_2 + N_3 V_3$$\nsubject to the constraint:\n$$N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 1$$\nWe are asked to find the temperature at the centroid of the triangle, $C$. The coordinates of the centroid are given by the arithmetic mean of the vertex coordinates:\n$$C = \\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{3}, \\frac{y_1+y_2+y_3}{3}\\right)$$\nThis can be written in vector form as:\n$$C = \\frac{1}{3}V_1 + \\frac{1}{3}V_2 + \\frac{1}{3}V_3$$\nBy comparing this expression for the centroid $C$ with the definition of barycentric coordinates, we can directly identify the basis function values at the centroid:\n$$N_1(C) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$N_2(C) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$N_3(C) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis is a general property for any triangle: the barycentric coordinates of the centroid are always $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n\nTherefore, the temperature at the centroid, $T_c$, is found by substituting these basis function values into the interpolation formula:\n$$T_c = T(C) = N_1(C)T_1 + N_2(C)T_2 + N_3(C)T_3$$\n$$T_c = \\frac{1}{3}T_1 + \\frac{1}{3}T_2 + \\frac{1}{3}T_3 = \\frac{T_1 + T_2 + T_3}{3}$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a linear interpolation over a triangle, the value at the centroid is simply the arithmetic average of the values at the vertices. The specific coordinates of the vertices are not required for this part of the derivation, only for confirming that a valid triangle exists.\n\nNow, we substitute the given temperature values:\n$$T_1 = 294\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$T_2 = 317\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$T_3 = 305\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe temperature at the centroid is:\n$$T_c = \\frac{294 + 317 + 305}{3}$$\n$$T_c = \\frac{916}{3}\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe number $916$ is not divisible by $3$ (since the sum of its digits, $9+1+6=16$, is not divisible by $3$), so the fraction is in its simplest form.
