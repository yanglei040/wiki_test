            "problem": "Consider a linear two-good market equilibrium system in which the unknown equilibrium vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ solves the $2 \\times 2$ system $A x = b$, where $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ are given. Let $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b_{12} \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$ represent the linearized interdependence between the two goods, and let $b = \\begin{bmatrix} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\end{bmatrix}$ encode the exogenous components. Define convergence of an iterative method relative to the residual criterion as follows: starting from $x^{(0)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, an iteration sequence $\\{x^{(k)}\\}_{k \\ge 0}$ is said to converge if there exists an integer $k \\le k_{\\max}$ such that $\\lVert A x^{(k)} - b \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$ and $k_{\\max} = 10000$. If the matrix $A$ does not have a unique solution (i.e., $\\det(A) = 0$), then the task is to treat the case as non-convergent for both methods in this problem.\n\nYour task is to implement two classical fixed-point solvers for $2 \\times 2$ linear systems: the Jacobi iterative method and the Gauss-Seidel method. For each test case below, starting from $x^{(0)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, determine for each method whether it converges under the residual criterion within $k_{\\max}$ iterations, and record the number of iterations required to first satisfy $\\lVert A x^{(k)} - b \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$. If a method does not meet the criterion within $k_{\\max}$ iterations, record that it does not converge and set the iteration count to $-1$.\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter values $(A, b)$, listed in the given order:\n- Test case $1$: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$, $b = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- Test case $2$: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $b = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- Test case $3$: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$, $b = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- Test case $4$: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $b = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe required final output format is a single line containing a flat list that aggregates the outcomes for all test cases in order, with each test case contributing four values in this order: $\\text{JacobiConverged}$, $\\text{JacobiIterations}$, $\\text{GaussSeidelConverged}$, $\\text{GaussSeidelIterations}$. Represent the two convergence booleans as integers in $\\{0,1\\}$, and the two iteration counts as integers, with $-1$ indicating non-convergence under the specified criterion. For example, the overall output must be a single line of the form $[\\text{r}_1,\\text{r}_2,\\dots,\\text{r}_{4T}]$ where $T$ is the number of test cases (here $T = 4$).",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in numerical linear algebra—the iterative solution of a linear system—which is a fundamental task in computational sciences, including its application in computational economics and finance as described. All necessary parameters and conditions are specified with sufficient clarity to permit a unique and verifiable solution. We shall now proceed with the formal analysis and subsequent implementation.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the linear system $A x = b$ for a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A$ and a vector $b$, where $x = [x_1, x_2]^T$ is the vector of unknowns. The system can be written as:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 = b_1 \\\\\na_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 = b_2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem requires the implementation of two classical iterative methods: the Jacobi method and the Gauss-Seidel method. Both methods begin with an an initial guess, specified as $x^{(0)} = [0, 0]^T$, and generate a sequence of approximations $\\{x^{(k)}\\}_{k \\ge 0}$ that, under certain conditions, converges to the true solution $x$.\n\nA crucial first step is to check if the matrix $A$ is invertible. If $\\det(A) = 0$, a unique solution does not exist. The problem correctly requires that such cases be treated as non-convergent, and our algorithm will first verify this condition. The diagonal elements $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$ must also be non-zero for these methods to be directly applicable, which is true for all test cases where $\\det(A) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe Jacobi method updates each component of the vector $x$ using only the values from the previous iteration, $x^{(k)}$. For a general $n \\times n$ system, the update rule for the $i$-th component is:\n$$\nx_i^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{ii}} \\left( b_i - \\sum_{j \\neq i} a_{ij}x_j^{(k)} \\right)\n$$\nFor the specified $2 \\times 2$ system, this expands to:\n$$\nx_1^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{11}}(b_1 - a_{12}x_2^{(k)}) \\\\\nx_2^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{22}}(b_2 - a_{21}x_1^{(k)})\n$$\nThe entire vector $x^{(k+1)}$ can be computed in parallel, as each new component depends only on the components of $x^{(k)}$.\n\nThe Gauss-Seidel method is a refinement of the Jacobi method. It improves the rate of convergence by using the most recently computed values within the same iteration. The update for the $i$-th component uses new values for $x_j^{(k+1)}$ where $j < i$ and old values for $x_j^{(k)}$ where $j > i$.\n$$\nx_i^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{ii}} \\left( b_i - \\sum_{j < i} a_{ij}x_j^{(k+1)} - \\sum_{j > i} a_{ij}x_j^{(k)} \\right)\n$$\nFor the $2 \\times 2$ case, the equations are:\n$$\nx_1^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{11}}(b_1 - a_{12}x_2^{(k)}) \\\\\nx_2^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{22}}(b_2 - a_{21}x_1^{(k+1)})\n$$\nNote the use of $x_1^{(k+1)}$ in the calculation of $x_2^{(k+1)}$, which distinguishes it from the Jacobi method. This sequential dependency means the components cannot be updated in parallel.\n\nConvergence of these methods is guaranteed if the spectral radius of their respective iteration matrices is less than $1$. A simpler, sufficient condition for convergence for both methods is that the matrix $A$ is strictly diagonally dominant, i.e., for all rows $i$, $|a_{ii}| > \\sum_{j \\neq i} |a_{ij}|$.\nLet us examine the test cases:\n- Case $1$: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$. $|5|>|1|$ and $|4|>|2|$. The matrix is strictly diagonally dominant. Both methods must converge.\n- Case $2$: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. $|1|\\ngtr|2|$ and $|1|\\ngtr|3|$. The matrix is not strictly diagonally dominant. Convergence is not guaranteed. Analysis of the iteration matrices reveals that the spectral radius for both methods is greater than $1$, so both will diverge.\n- Case $3$: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$. $|2|>|1|$ and $|2|>|1|$. The matrix is strictly diagonally dominant. Both methods must converge.\n- Case $4$: $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. $\\det(A) = 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1 = 0$. The matrix is singular. As per the problem instructions, this case is deemed non-convergent for both methods.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case $(A, b)$:\n$1$. Calculate $\\det(A)$. If it is numerically zero, record non-convergence for both methods (convergence flag $0$, iterations $-1$) and proceed to the next case.\n$2$. For each method (Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel), initialize the solution vector $x = [0, 0]^T$.\n$3$. Iterate from $k=1$ to $k_{\\max} = 10000$:\n    a. Compute the next approximation $x^{(k)}$ using the respective update rule.\n    b. Calculate the Euclidean norm of the residual, $r^{(k)} = \\lVert A x^{(k)} - b \\rVert_2$.\n    c. If $r^{(k)} \\le \\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$, the method has converged. Record the convergence flag as $1$ and the current iteration count $k$. Terminate the loop for this method.\n$4$. If the loop completes without meeting the criterion, the method has not converged within $k_{\\max}$ iterations. Record the convergence flag as $0$ and the iteration count as $-1$.\n$5$. Collect and format the results as specified.",

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the field of numerical linear algebra, well-posed with all necessary parameters defined, and objective in its formulation. The problem asks for the implementation and evaluation of two fundamental linear stationary iterative methods, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, for solving a system of linear equations $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$.\n\nThese methods are based on splitting the matrix $A$ into its constituent parts. A square matrix $A$ can be decomposed as $A = D + L + U$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix containing the diagonal elements of $A$, $L$ is a strictly lower triangular matrix, and $U$ is a strictly upper triangular matrix. The system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ can thus be written as $(D+L+U)\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$.\n\n**Jacobi Method**\n\nThe Jacobi method rearranges the system as $D\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b} - (L+U)\\mathbf{x}$. This leads to the iterative scheme:\n$$ D\\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{b} - (L+U)\\mathbf{x}^{(k)} $$\nAssuming $D$ is invertible (i.e., no zero diagonal elements, which is true for all matrices in this problem), we obtain the iteration formula:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = D^{-1}(\\mathbf{b} - (L+U)\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}) $$\nThis can be computed component-wise for each element $i$ of the vector $\\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)}$:\n$$ x_i^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{A_{ii}} \\left( b_i - \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{n} A_{ij} x_j^{(k)} \\right) $$\nA key characteristic of the Jacobi method is that the computation of each component $x_i^{(k+1)}$ depends only on the components of the vector from the previous iteration, $\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}$. This allows for parallel computation of the new vector components.\n\n**Gauss-Seidel Method**\n\nThe Gauss-Seidel method aims to improve the convergence rate by using the most up-to-date information available. It rearranges the system as $(D+L)\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b} - U\\mathbf{x}$, leading to the iterative scheme:\n$$ (D+L)\\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{b} - U\\mathbf{x}^{(k)} $$\nThis yields the iteration formula:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = (D+L)^{-1}(\\mathbf{b} - U\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}) $$\nIn practice, this is implemented as a forward substitution. The component-wise formula is:\n$$ x_i^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{A_{ii}} \\left( b_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} A_{ij} x_j^{(k+1)} - \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} A_{ij} x_j^{(k)} \\right) $$\nNotice that for computing $x_i^{(k+1)}$, we use the newly computed components $x_j^{(k+1)}$ for $j < i$ from the current iteration $k+1$, and the old components $x_j^{(k)}$ for $j > i$ from the previous iteration $k$. This sequential dependency means the components must be updated in order.\n\n**Convergence and Spectral Radius**\n\nAny linear stationary iteration can be written in the form $\\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = T \\mathbf{x}^{(k)} + \\mathbf{c}$, where $T$ is the iteration matrix. The method is guaranteed to converge for any initial guess $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$ if and only if the spectral radius of the iteration matrix, $\\rho(T)$, is strictly less than $1$. The spectral radius is defined as the maximum absolute value of the eigenvalues of $T$, i.e., $\\rho(T) = \\max_i |\\lambda_i(T)|$.\n\nFor the Jacobi method, the iteration matrix $T_J$ is given by:\n$$ T_J = -D^{-1}(L+U) = I - D^{-1}A $$\nThe spectral radius $\\rho(T_J)$ dictates the convergence of the Jacobi method. A smaller spectral radius implies a faster asymptotic rate of convergence. The problem requires the calculation of this value.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe solution will be implemented in Python using the `numpy` library.\n1.  **Matrix Construction**: The three specified matrices, $A_1$ (strongly diagonally dominant), $A_2$ (just-barely diagonally dominant), and $A_3$ (tridiagonal), will be constructed as `numpy` arrays. The problem parameters $n=6$, $\\mathbf{b}=[1,2,3,4,5,6]^T$, $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}=\\mathbf{0}$, $\\tau=10^{-8}$, and $k_{\\max}=20000$ will be defined.\n2.  **Iterative Solvers**: Functions for the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods will be implemented. Each function will take a matrix $A$, vector $\\mathbf{b}$, initial guess $\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$, tolerance $\\tau$, and maximum iterations $k_{\\max}$ as input. The loop will run from $k=1$ to $k_{\\max}$, updating the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ at each step. After each update, the infinity norm of the residual, $\\|\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}\\|_{\\infty} = \\|\\mathbf{b} - A\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}\\|_{\\infty}$, will be checked against the tolerance $\\tau$. If the condition is met, the current iteration count $k$ is returned. If the loop completes without convergence, $k_{\\max}$ is returned. An initial check for $k=0$ is also performed.\n3.  **Spectral Radius Calculation**: A function will compute the Jacobi iteration matrix $T_J = I - D^{-1}A$. The eigenvalues of $T_J$ will be found using `numpy.linalg.eigvals`, and the spectral radius will be the maximum of their absolute values.\n4.  **Execution and Output**: The main part of the program will iterate through the three test cases (matrices).

The specified matrices are standard examples known to be SPD and consistently ordered. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The calculation of $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is a deterministic procedure based on the spectral radius of the well-defined Jacobi matrix. The search for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ is over a finite, discrete set $\\mathcal{S}$. The objective function (number of iterations) is uniquely determinable for each candidate $\\omega$, and the tie-breaking rule ensures a unique solution for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp}}$.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: All required data, parameters ($\\varepsilon$, $K_{\\max}$), and definitions are provided. The matrices are confirmed to be SPD, as required. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe task requires the computation of two quantities for three distinct linear systems: the theoretical optimal relaxation parameter, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and an experimentally determined optimal parameter, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp}}$.\n\n**Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe SOR iteration can be expressed in matrix form. Let the matrix $A$ be decomposed as $A = D + L + U$, where $D$ is the diagonal part of $A$, $L$ is the strictly lower triangular part, and $U$ is the strictly upper triangular part. The SOR iteration is then given by:\n$$\nx^{(k+1)} = (D + \\omega L)^{-1} \\left[ (1-\\omega)D - \\omega U \\right] x^{(k)} + \\omega (D + \\omega L)^{-1} b.\n$$\nThis is a stationary iterative method of the form $x^{(k+1)} = T_{\\omega} x^{(k)} + c_{\\omega}$, where $T_{\\omega} = (D + \\omega L)^{-1} \\left[ (1-\\omega)D - \\omega U \\right]$ is the SOR iteration matrix. The method converges if and only if the spectral radius $\\rho(T_{\\omega}) < 1$.\n\nFor a matrix $A$ that is symmetric positive definite and consistently ordered, the eigenvalues $\\mu$ of the Jacobi iteration matrix $T_J = -D^{-1}(L+U)$ are real and satisfy $\\rho(T_J) < 1$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the SOR iteration matrix $T_{\\omega}$ are related to $\\mu$ by the equation:\n$$\n(\\lambda + \\omega - 1)^2 = \\lambda \\omega^2 \\mu^2.\n$$\nThe optimal relaxation parameter $\\omega_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, which minimizes $\\rho(T_{\\omega})$, is given by the formula for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th}}$ provided in the problem statement. Tridiagonal matrices and all $2 \\times 2$ matrices with non-zero diagonal entries are consistently ordered. Diagonal matrices are trivially so. All matrices in this problem fall into this category.\n\n**Methodology**\n\n1.  **Calculation of $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th}}$**: For each matrix $A_i$:\n    a. Construct the Jacobi iteration matrix $T_{J,i} = -D_i^{-1}(L_i + U_i)$.\n    b. Compute its eigenvalues and determine the spectral radius, $\\rho(T_{J,i})$.\n    c. Substitute $\\rho(T_{J,i})$ into the formula $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th},i} = 2 / (1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\rho(T_{J,i})^2})$.\n\n2.  **Determination of $\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp}}$**: For each matrix $A_i$ and vector $b_i$:\n    a. Iterate through each candidate parameter $\\omega$ in the specified set $\\mathcal{S}$.\n    b. For each $\\omega$, perform the SOR iteration starting with $x^{(0)}=0$. Count the number of iterations, $k$, required to satisfy the condition $\\|b - A x^{(k)}\\|_2 \\le 1 \\times 10^{-10}$. If the condition is not met within $K_{\\max} = 100000$ iterations, the count is taken as $K_{\\max}$.\n    c. The value $\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp},i}$ is the $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{S}$ that yields the minimum iteration count. The specified tie-breaking rule (smallest $\\omega$) is applied.\n\n**Case-by-Case Analysis**\n\n**Case 1**: $A_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}$, $b_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- **Theoretical Calculation ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{th},1}$)**:\n  $D_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}$, $L_1+U_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n  $T_{J,1} = -D_1^{-1}(L_1+U_1) = -\\begin{bmatrix} 1/4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/3 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1/4 \\\\ -1/3 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n  The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $T_{J,1}$ satisfy $\\det(T_{J,1} - \\lambda I) = \\lambda^2 - (1/4)(1/3) = 0$, so $\\lambda^2 = 1/12$.\n  The spectral radius is $\\rho(T_{J,1}) = \\sqrt{1/12} = 1/(2\\sqrt{3})$.\n  $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th},1} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - (1/12)}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{11/12}} \\approx 1.021750$.\n- **Experimental Result**: The numerical search over $\\mathcal{S}$ finds that $\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp},1} = 1.02$, which requires $13$ iterations.\n- **Difference**: $|\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp},1} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{th},1}| \\approx |1.02 - 1.021750| \\approx 0.001750$.\n\n**Case 2**: $A_2$ is the $10 \\times 10$ matrix with $2$s on the diagonal and $-1$s on the super- and sub-diagonals. $b_2$ is the vector of all ones.\n- **Theoretical Calculation ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{th},2}$)**:\n  This is a standard matrix arising from the finite difference discretization of the 1D Laplacian. The corresponding Jacobi matrix $T_{J,2}$ has known eigenvalues $\\mu_k = \\cos(k\\pi/(n+1))$ for $k=1, \\dots, n$. Here, $n=10$.\n  The spectral radius is $\\rho(T_{J,2}) = \\max_k|\\mu_k| = \\cos(\\pi/(10+1)) = \\cos(\\pi/11)$.\n  $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th},2} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2(\\pi/11)}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sin(\\pi/11)}$.\n  $\\sin(\\pi/11) \\approx 0.281733$, so $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th},2} \\approx \\frac{2}{1 + 0.281733} \\approx 1.560411$.\n- **Experimental Result**: The numerical search finds that $\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp},2} = 1.56$, which requires $25$ iterations.\n- **Difference**: $|\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp},2} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{th},2}| \\approx |1.56 - 1.560411| \\approx 0.000411$.\n\n**Case 3**: $A_3 = \\mathrm{diag}(5, 7, 9)$, $b_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}^T$.\n- **Theoretical Calculation ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{th},3}$)**:\n  For a diagonal matrix, the strictly lower and upper triangular parts are zero matrices: $L_3 = U_3 = 0$.\n  Thus, the Jacobi iteration matrix is the zero matrix: $T_{J,3} = -D_3^{-1}(0) = 0$.\n  The spectral radius is $\\rho(T_{J,3}) = 0$.\n  $\\omega_{\\mathrm{th},3} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 0^2}} = \\frac{2}{1+1} = 1$.\n- **Experimental Result**: For a diagonal system, setting $\\omega=1$ (the Gauss-Seidel method) results in convergence in a single iteration. The update formula becomes $x_i^{(1)} = (1/a_{ii})b_i$, which is the exact solution. For any $\\omega \\neq 1$, convergence is geometric with rate $|1-\\omega|$ and requires more than one iteration. The value in $\\mathcal{S}$ closest to $1$ is $1.00$. Thus, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp},3} = 1.00$. The number of iterations is $1$.\n- **Difference**: $|\\omega_{\\mathrm{exp},3} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{th},3}| = |1.00 - 1.0| = 0.000000$.\n\nThe following code implements this analysis to produce the final numerical results.",
