The use of Monte Carlo simulation to estimate a probability is a standard and robust technique in computational science and engineering. The problem is firmly rooted in established mathematical and computational principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear and unambiguous definition of the quantity to be estimated, $p_n$. It specifies the population ($\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$), the sampling distribution (uniform), the sample size ($m$), and the PRNG seed ($s$). This is a complete specification for a Monte Carlo experiment, which guarantees a unique, deterministic result for each test case.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-defined computational problem based on sound mathematical principles. A complete solution will now be developed.\n\n**Principle-Based Solution**\n\nThe objective is to estimate the probability, $p_n$, that a positive integer selected uniformly at random from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ is square-free. This probability is defined as the mean of an indicator random variable. Let $K$ be a random variable with a discrete uniform distribution on $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. Then,\n$$p_n = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}\\{K \\text{ is square-free}\\}]$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}\\{\\cdot\\}$ is the indicator function.\n\nThe Monte Carlo method provides a powerful way to estimate such an expectation. By the Law of Large Numbers, the sample mean of independent and identically distributed random variables converges to the true expectation. We generate $m$ independent samples, $k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_m$, from the distribution of $K$. The Monte Carlo estimator for $p_n$, denoted $\\hat{p}_{n,m}$, is the sample mean of the indicator function evaluated at these samples:\n$$\\hat{p}_{n,m} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\mathbf{1}\\{k_i \\text{ is square-free}\\}$$\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of samples that are square-free and dividing by the total number of samples, $m$.\n\nThe core computational task is to implement a function that correctly determines if an integer $k$ is square-free. A positive integer $k$ is square-free if it is not divisible by any perfect square greater than $1$. It is sufficient to check for divisibility by the squares of prime numbers. If $k$ were divisible by a composite square, $(ab)^2$, it would also be divisible by the squares of the prime factors of $ab$. Therefore, $k$ is square-free if and only if for every prime number $p$, $p^2$ does not divide $k$.\n\nFor a given integer $k$, we only need to perform this check for primes $p$ such that $p^2 \\le k$. To implement this test efficiently across many calls, it is advantageous to pre-compute a list of all primes up to $\\sqrt{\\max(n)}$, where $\\max(n)$ is the largest value of $n$ across all test cases. In this problem, $\\max(n) = 10^6$, so we require primes up to $\\sqrt{10^6} = 1000$. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classical and efficient algorithm for this purpose.\n\nThe overall algorithm for each test case $(n, m, s)$ is as follows:\n1.  **Pre-computation**: Generate a list of all prime numbers up to $1000$ using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This is done once for all test cases.\n2.  **Initialization**: Initialize a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) with the specified seed $s$.\n3.  **Sampling**: Draw $m$ random integers, $k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_m$, from the discrete uniform distribution on $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n4.  **Counting**: Initialize a counter to zero. For each sample $k_i$, test if it is square-free using the pre-computed list of primes. If $k_i$ is square-free, increment the counter.\n5.  **Estimation**: Compute the estimate $\\hat{p}_{n,m}$ as the final count divided by the sample size $m$.\n6.  **Formatting**: Round the estimate to $6$ decimal places.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic for a given test case and will produce a single, verifiable estimate of $p_n$. The results for all test cases are then aggregated into the specified final output format.",

The definitions for the hypersphere, hypercube, and the Monte Carlo estimator are standard and mathematically correct. The problem rests on the principles of probability theory and statistical estimation. It is entirely sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. For each test case, all necessary parameters ($d$, $N$, $s$) are provided. The use of a seeded pseudo-random number generator ensures that the sequence of random vectors $X_i$ is deterministic, leading to a unique and computable value for the estimator $\\widehat{R}_N(d,s)$.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical language. It is free from any subjective or speculative content.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and directly related to the specified topic of Monte Carlo methods.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with formulating and presenting the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the estimator $\\widehat{R}_N(d,s)$ for several test cases. This estimator approximates the ratio $R(d) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Vol}(S_d)}{\\mathrm{Vol}(C_d)}$. The methodology is based on the principles of Monte Carlo integration.\n\nLet $X$ be a random vector uniformly distributed in the hypercube $C_d$. The probability that this vector lies within the inscribed hypersphere $S_d$ is given by the ratio of their volumes:\n$$\nP(X \\in S_d) = \\frac{\\int_{C_d} \\mathbf{1}\\{x \\in S_d\\} dx}{\\int_{C_d} 1 dx} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Vol}(S_d)}{\\mathrm{Vol}(C_d)} = R(d)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}\\{x \\in S_d\\}$ is the indicator function that is $1$ if $x \\in S_d$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe problem defines an estimator for this probability. We generate $N$ independent random vectors $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N$, each uniformly distributed in $C_d$. For each vector $X_i$, we define a Bernoulli random variable $Z_i = \\mathbf{1}\\{X_i \\in S_d\\}$. The condition $X_i \\in S_d$ is equivalent to $\\lVert X_i \\rVert_2 \\le 1$. The expectation of each $Z_i$ is precisely the probability $R(d)$:\n$$\nE[Z_i] = 1 \\cdot P(Z_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(Z_i=0) = P(X_i \\in S_d) = R(d)\n$$\nThe estimator $\\widehat{R}_N(d,s)$ is the sample mean of these $N$ Bernoulli trials:\n$$\n\\widehat{R}_N(d,s) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N Z_i = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbf{1}\\{\\lVert X_i \\rVert_2 \\le 1\\}\n$$\nBy the Law of Large Numbers, this sample mean converges to the true expectation as $N$ approaches infinity:\n$$\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\widehat{R}_N(d,s) = R(d)\n$$\nThis provides the theoretical justification for the method. The prescribed algorithm for computing $\\widehat{R}_N(d,s)$ for a given set of parameters $(d, N, s)$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Initialize a pseudo-random number generator with the specified integer seed $s$. This ensures reproducibility of the results.\n\n2.  **Sample Generation**: Generate a set of $N$ random vectors, $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_N\\}$, where each $X_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\dots, x_{id})$ is a point in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. To ensure the vectors are uniformly distributed in the hypercube $C_d = [-1, 1]^d$, each component $x_{ij}$ must be drawn from the uniform distribution $U[-1, 1]$. This is achieved computationally by generating an $N \\times d$ matrix of floating-point numbers where each entry is an independent sample from $U[-1, 1]$.\n\n3.  **Condition Checking**: For each vector $X_i$, determine if it lies inside the unit hypersphere $S_d$. This is done by checking if its Euclidean norm is less than or equal to $1$. For computational efficiency, it is preferable to check the squared norm:\n    $$\n    \\lVert X_i \\rVert_2 \\le 1 \\iff \\lVert X_i \\rVert_2^2 \\le 1^2 \\iff \\sum_{j=1}^d x_{ij}^2 \\le 1\n    $$\n    This avoids the computationally expensive square root operation.\n\n4.  **Estimation**: Count the number of vectors, let us call it $M$, that satisfy the condition from the previous step. This count is equivalent to the sum of the indicator functions: $M = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbf{1}\\{\\lVert X_i \\rVert_2^2 \\le 1\\}$. The Monte Carlo estimate is then calculated as the ratio:\n    $$\n    \\widehat{R}_N(d,s) = \\frac{M}{N}\n    $$\n5.  **Finalization**: The procedure is repeated for each test case $(d, N, s)$, and the resulting estimate is rounded to $6$ decimal places as required. The phenomenon of the \"curse of dimensionality\" will become apparent, where for high dimensions $d$, the volume of the hypersphere becomes exceedingly small relative to the hypercube, and the estimate $\\widehat{R}_N(d,s)$ rapidly approaches zero. For $d=20$, it is statistically probable that $M=0$, yielding an estimate of $0$.\n\nThis completes the theoretical framework and algorithmic design. The implementation will proceed based on this logic.",

You must justify your choice in your solution.\n- Each trial must use an independent uniformly random permutation of the $N$ sites to determine the opening order.\n- For each test case, report only the Monte Carlo estimate (the arithmetic mean of the recorded thresholds across trials), as a decimal rounded to exactly $4$ digits after the decimal point.\n\nTest suite:\nYour program must run the following four parameter sets and produce the estimates in the specified order:\n- Case A (happy path, target of interest): $n = 50$, number of trials $= 200$, random seed $= 12345$.\n- Case B (edge case, smallest lattice): $n = 1$, number of trials $= 200$, random seed $= 2$.\n- Case C (moderate lattice, more trials): $n = 10$, number of trials $= 300$, random seed $= 777$.\n- Case D (same size as Case A with more trials): $n = 50$, number of trials $= 300$, random seed $= 98765$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order [Case A, Case B, Case C, Case D]. Each entry must be rounded to exactly $4$ digits after the decimal point. For example, a valid output line has the form \"[0.5920,1.0000,0.5850,0.5925]\". No additional text may be printed.\n\nThere are no physical units, angles, or percentages in this task. All numerical values must be expressed as pure numbers.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the estimation of the site percolation threshold, denoted $p_c$, on an $n \\times n$ square lattice with free boundaries. This is to be achieved through a Monte Carlo simulation. The methodology is based on fundamental principles of probability theory and computational algorithm design.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the problem. The system is a square lattice with $N = n^2$ sites. In a single simulation trial, we begin with all sites designated as 'closed'. We then open sites one by one, with the order of site selection determined by a uniformly random permutation of the $N$ sites, drawn without replacement. Let $K$ be the number of open sites at the moment a continuous path of open, adjacent sites first connects the top boundary of the lattice to the bottom boundary. Adjacency is defined by the von Neumann neighborhood, or $4$-connectivity. The outcome of a single trial, $i$, is the critical fraction $p_i = K_i / N$. By conducting $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trials, we generate a set of observations $\\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_M\\}$.\n\nThe theoretical foundation for estimating the true percolation threshold rests upon the laws of large numbers. The percolation threshold $p_c$ is a property of the infinite lattice ($n \\to \\infty$). For a finite lattice of size $n$, we are estimating the expected value of the critical fraction, $E[K/N]$. Our Monte Carlo estimator, $\\hat{p}_c$, is the arithmetic mean of the trial outcomes:\n$$ \\hat{p}_c = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i=1}^{M} p_i $$\nAccording to the Strong Law of Large Numbers, as the number of trials $M$ approaches infinity, this sample mean converges almost surely to the true expected value for the given lattice size:\n$$ \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\hat{p}_c = E\\left[\\frac{K}{N}\\right] $$\nThe Central Limit Theorem further informs us that for a sufficiently large $M$, the distribution of the estimator $\\hat{p}_c$ is approximately normal, which allows for the quantification of statistical uncertainty, though this is not required for the present task.\n\nThe critical component of the algorithmic design is the efficient detection of the percolation event. A naive approach of performing a graph traversal, such as a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), from all top-row sites after each site is opened is computationally prohibitive. A single BFS/DFS on a grid of $N$ sites takes $O(N)$ time. Since we may need to open up to $O(N)$ sites, the total time for one trial would be $O(N^2)$, which is infeasible for the specified lattice size of $n = 50$ ($N = 2500$).\n\nA superior algorithm, and the one we shall employ, utilizes a Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure. This data structure excels at maintaining a collection of disjoint sets and efficiently tracking connectivity. Each site on the lattice is mapped to an element in the DSU. Initially, each of the $N$ sites exists in its own singleton set. When a site is opened, we iterate through its four neighbors. If a neighbor is already open, we perform a `union` operation on the sets containing the current site and its neighbor. With optimizations such as union-by-size and path compression, the amortized time complexity of the `union` and `find` operations is nearly constant, denoted as $O(\\alpha(N))$, where $\\alpha(N)$ is the extremely slow-growing inverse Ackermann function.\n\nTo specifically test for top-to-bottom percolation, we augment the DSU data structure. For each set in the DSU, represented by its root element, we maintain two boolean flags: `is_top_connected` and `is_bottom_connected`.\n- When a new site at row $r$ and column $c$ is opened, it initially forms its own set. If $r = 0$, its set's `is_top_connected` flag is set to `true`. If $r = n-1$, its `is_bottom_connected` flag is set to `true`. For the special case $n=1$, both flags are set to `true`.\n- When two sets are merged via the `union` operation, the new merged set inherits the connectivity properties. If either of the original sets was connected to the top, the new set is. The same logic applies to bottom connectivity.\nPercolation is detected at the exact moment a set simultaneously possesses both `is_top_connected = true` and `is_bottom_connected = true` properties. This can occur either upon the opening of a single site (for $n=1$) or immediately after a `union` operation.\n\nThe overall algorithm for the simulation is as follows:\n1. For each test case, specified by lattice size $n$, number of trials $M$, and random seed, initialize a list to store trial results.\n2. Initialize a pseudo-random number generator with the given seed to ensure reproducibility.\n3. Begin the main loop, which iterates $M$ times. Each iteration is one trial.\n4. Within a trial:\n    a. Initialize an $N = n^2$ element DSU data structure, augmented with the two boolean flags per set.\n    b. Keep track of which sites are open, for example, with a boolean array.\n    c. Generate a random permutation of the site indices from $0$ to $N-1$. This sequence dictates the order in which sites are opened.\n    d. Iterate through the permuted site indices. For each site `s` being opened:\n        i. Increment the count of open sites, $K$. Mark site `s` as open.\n        ii. Initialize the percolation flags for the new set containing only `s`. Check if this new one-site cluster percolates (only possible for $n=1$).\n        iii. Identify the four neighbors of `s`. For each neighbor `t` that is already open, perform `union(s, t)`.\n        iv. After each `union` operation, check if the newly formed cluster percolates by checking the flags of its root.\n        v. If percolation is detected, calculate the fraction $p_i = K/N$, store it, and terminate the current trial, proceeding to the next one.\n5. After all $M$ trials are complete, calculate the arithmetic mean of the stored fractions $\\{p_i\\}$.\n6. Format the result to the required precision and add it to the final list of answers.\n\nThis DSU-based approach provides a time complexity of approximately $O(N \\cdot \\alpha(N))$ per trial, making the simulation for all test cases computationally efficient and practical. The case $n=1$ is a trivial edge case where percolation occurs as soon as the single site is opened, so $K=1$, $N=1$, and the threshold is always $1.0$. The algorithm correctly handles this scenario.",
