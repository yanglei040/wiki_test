            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional linear advection equation on the periodic domain $\\Omega = [0,1]$,\n$$\nu_t + a\\,u_x = 0,\n$$\nwith constant advection speed $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and initial condition $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$, where $x \\in \\Omega$ and $t \\ge 0$. Let the spatial grid be uniform with $N$ cells of width $\\Delta x = 1/N$ and cell centers $x_i = \\left(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\Delta x$ for $i = 0,1,\\dots,N-1$. Let the method evolve cell averages $u_i^n$ at time levels $t^n$, in a conservative finite-volume form using numerical fluxes computed from the exact self-similar solution of the local Riemann problem at each cell interface. Enforce periodicity at $x=0$ and $x=1$. The time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition $|a|\\,\\Delta t \\le \\Delta x$, with a chosen Courant number $\\nu \\in (0,1]$ so that $\\Delta t = \\nu \\,\\Delta x/|a|$ when $|a|>0$, and any $\\Delta t>0$ when $a=0$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the numerical solution of the one-dimensional linear advection equation,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0,\n$$\non a periodic domain $\\Omega = [0,1]$ with a constant advection speed $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The initial condition is given by $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$. We are to employ a conservative finite-volume method.\n\nThis problem is a standard, well-posed problem in computational fluid dynamics and is scientifically sound. It describes the first-order upwind method, a fundamental scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws. All parameters, conditions, and objectives are clearly defined and consistent. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, we discretize the spatial domain $\\Omega$ into $N$ uniform cells, $C_i = [x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}]$ for $i=0, \\dots, N-1$. The width of each cell is $\\Delta x = 1/N$. The cell interfaces are located at $x_{i+1/2} = (i+1)\\Delta x$. The cell centers are $x_i = (i+1/2)\\Delta x$. The numerical solution consists of cell averages at discrete time levels $t^n$:\n$$\nu_i^n \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} u(x, t^n) \\, dx.\n$$\nIntegrating the PDE over cell $C_i$ and over the time interval $[t^n, t^{n+1}]$ yields the exact relation for the cell average:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{t^n}^{t^{n+1}} \\left( f(u(x_{i+1/2}, t)) - f(u(x_{i-1/2}, t)) \\right) dt,\n$$\nwhere $f(u) = au$ is the flux function for the linear advection equation. Approximating the time integral with a single evaluation at $t^n$ leads to the semi-discrete conservative form:\n$$\n\\frac{du_i}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\Delta x} (F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2}),\n$$\nwhere $F_{i+1/2}$ and $F_{i-1/2}$ are the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces. A forward Euler time integration gives the fully-discrete form:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (F_{i+1/2}^n - F_{i-1/2}^n).\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the numerical flux is to be determined from the exact solution of the local Riemann problem at each interface. This defines the Godunov method. For the linear advection equation, the solution to the Riemann problem with initial states $u_L$ and $u_R$ is $u(x/t) = u_L$ for $x/t  a$ and $u(x/t) = u_R$ for $x/t > a$. The value at the interface ($x/t=0$) is taken from the upwind direction.\nThus, the state at interface $x_{i+1/2}$ is $u_{i+1/2} = u_i^n$ if $a>0$ and $u_{i+1/2} = u_{i+1}^n$ if $a0$.\nThe numerical flux $F_{i+1/2}^n = f(u_{i+1/2}) = a u_{i+1/2}$ is therefore:\n$$\nF_{i+1/2}^n = \\begin{cases}\na u_i^n,  a > 0, \\\\\na u_{i+1}^n,  a  0, \\\\\n0,  a = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is the first-order upwind flux.\n\nThe update scheme differs for the sign of $a$:\nCase $1$: $a > 0$. The flux difference is $F_{i+1/2}^n - F_{i-1/2}^n = a u_i^n - a u_{i-1}^n$. The update scheme is:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n).\n$$\nCase $2$: $a  0$. The flux difference is $F_{i+1/2}^n - F_{i-1/2}^n = a u_{i+1}^n - a u_i^n$. The update scheme is:\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n).\n$$\nCase $3$: $a=0$. The flux is zero, so $u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n$. The solution is static.\n\nThe Courant number is defined as $\\nu = |a| \\Delta t / \\Delta x$. The update schemes can be written in terms of $\\nu$:\nFor $a > 0$: $u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\nu (u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n)$.\nFor $a  0$: $u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + \\nu (u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n)$, since $a\\Delta t/\\Delta x = -|a|\\Delta t/\\Delta x = -\\nu$.\nPeriodic boundary conditions mean that indices are handled modulo $N$, i.e., $u_{-1}^n = u_{N-1}^n$ and $u_N^n = u_0^n$.\n\nThe time step is $\\Delta t = \\nu \\Delta x / |a|$ for $a \\neq 0$. The simulation runs from $t=0$ to $t=T$. If $T$ is not an integer multiple of $\\Delta t$, the final time step is adjusted to be smaller, $T - t^n$, to land exactly on the final time.\n\nThe initial cell averages $u_i^0$ are formally given by $u_i^0 = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{i\\Delta x}^{(i+1)\\Delta x} u_0(x) \\, dx$. For the smooth initial profiles (Cases $2$ and $4$), a second-order accurate approximation is $u_i^0 \\approx u_0(x_i)$. For the discontinuous profiles (Cases $1$ and $3$), the discontinuities are aligned with the grid interfaces, i.e., they occur at integer multiples of $\\Delta x$. In such a special case, the cell-averaged value $u_i^0$ is exactly equal to the point value at the cell center, $u_0(x_i)$. Thus, for all given test cases, we can initialize the solution by point-wise sampling: $u_i^0 = u_0(x_i)$.\n\nFinally, the discrete $L^1$ error is computed at $t=T$ by comparing the numerical solution $u_i(T)$ with the exact solution evaluated at the cell centers. The exact solution is $u(x,T) = u_0((x - aT) \\pmod 1)$. The error is:\n$$\nE_{L^1} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\left| u_i(T) - u_0\\big((x_i - aT)\\bmod 1\\big) \\right|\\,\\Delta x.\n$$\nThe modulo operator ensures the argument of $u_0$ is mapped back into the domain $[0,1]$.",

The equation is given by\n$$u_t + a\\,u_x = 0$$\non a periodic spatial domain $x \\in [0,L)$. The flux function for this conservation law is $f(u) = a\\,u$. The problem is to be solved using a conservative finite volume method, which in one dimension takes the general form\n$$U_i^{n+1} = U_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2} \\right)$$\nHere, $U_i^n$ is the average value of the solution in cell $i$ at time $t_n = n\\Delta t$, $\\Delta x$ is the uniform cell width, $\\Delta t$ is the time step, and $F_{i+1/2}$ is the numerical flux at the interface between cell $i$ and cell $i+1$.\n\nFirst, we must discretize the initial condition. The continuous initial state is a square wave,\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\nu_{\\text{high}},  \\text{if } (x - x_0) \\bmod L \\in [0,w),\\\\\nu_{\\text{low}},  \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe domain $[0,L)$ is partitioned into $M$ cells, where cell $i$ covers the spatial interval $[i\\Delta x, (i+1)\\Delta x)$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, M-1\\}$, with $\\Delta x=L/M$.

The numerical flux is determined by the solution to the Riemann problem at the cell interface. For the linear advection equation, the characteristic speed is constant ($a$), so the information flows from the left if $a>0$ and from the right if $a0$. The resulting flux is\n    $$F_{i+1/2}^{\\text{Godunov}} = \\begin{cases} f(U_i^n) = a\\,U_i^n,  \\text{if } a \\geq 0 \\\\ f(U_{i+1}^n) = a\\,U_{i+1}^n,  \\text{if } a  0 \\end{cases}$$\n    The update rule can be written as:\n    $$U_i^{n+1} = U_i^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}(U_i^n - U_{i-1}^n), \\quad \\text{for } a \\geq 0$$\n    $$U_i^{n+1} = U_i^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}(U_{i+1}^n - U_i^n), \\quad \\text{for } a  0$$\n    Using the Courant number $\\nu = a \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$, where $|\\nu|$ is the CFL number, this is $U_i^{n+1} = U_i^n - \\nu(U_i^n - U_{i-1}^n)$ for $a \\geq 0$ and $U_i^{n+1} = U_i^n - \\nu(U_{i+1}^n - U_i^n)$ for $a  0$.\n\n2.  **Lax–Friedrichs Scheme**: This scheme introduces significant numerical dissipation by averaging adjacent states. The numerical flux is\n    $$F_{i+1/2}^{\\text{LF}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( f(U_i^n) + f(U_{i+1}^n) \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\\left( U_{i+1}^n - U_i^n \\right)$$\n    Substituting this flux into the conservative update formula yields the direct update rule:\n    $$U_i^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(U_{i+1}^n + U_{i-1}^n) - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x}(U_{i+1}^n - U_{i-1}^n)$$\n    Using the Courant number $\\nu = a \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$, this becomes $U_i^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(U_{i+1}^n + U_{i-1}^n) - \\frac{\\nu}{2}(U_{i+1}^n - U_{i-1}^n)$.\n\nThe solution is evolved from $t=0$ to the final time $T=L/|a|$, which corresponds to one full advection period. The number of time steps is $N = T/\\Delta t = (L/|a|)/(\\text{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x/|a|) = L/(\\text{CFL} \\cdot L/M) = M/\\text{CFL}$, which is an integer for all test cases.\n\nTo quantify numerical dissipation, we compute the total variation (TV) of the discrete solution $\\{u_i\\}_{i=0}^{M-1}$ as\n$$\\operatorname{TV}(u) = \\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} |u_i - u_{i-1}|$$\nwhere periodicity implies $u_{-1} \\equiv u_{M-1}$. The exact solution at time $T$ is identical to the initial condition due to the periodic advection, so its total variation is unchanged. Numerical schemes, however, introduce dissipation which typically reduces the total variation of the solution, smearing sharp gradients. We compute the initial total variation $\\operatorname{TV}(U^0)$ and the final total variation $\\operatorname{TV}(U^N)$. The relative total variation, $R = \\operatorname{TV}(U^N) / \\operatorname{TV}(U^0)$, serves as the metric for dissipation. A value of $R$ close to $1$ indicates low dissipation, while a smaller value indicates higher dissipation. We will compute this ratio $R$ for both schemes for each specified test case.",

The goal is to demonstrate, from first principles, that the HLL solver incorrectly diffuses a stationary contact discontinuity while the HLLC solver resolves it exactly.\n\nBegin from the fundamental conservation laws in one space dimension for mass, momentum, and energy, written in conservative form with state vector $\\mathbf{U}$ and flux $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{U}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U})}{\\partial x} = 0,\n$$\nwhere for the Euler equations,\n$$\n\\mathbf{U} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\rho \\\\\n\\rho u \\\\\nE\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\quad\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}) = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\rho u \\\\\n\\rho u^2 + p \\\\\nu (E + p)\n\\end{bmatrix},\n$$\nand the total energy satisfies\n$$\nE = \\frac{p}{\\gamma - 1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho u^2.\n$$\nAssume an ideal gas with ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$. Use a uniform grid of $N$ cells on a unit-length domain with cell width $\\Delta x = 1/N$.

Use a numerical tolerance $10^{-12}$ to decide equality to zero.\n\nTest Suite:\nFor each test case, initialize primitive variables $(\\rho, u, p)$ piecewise-constantly with a discontinuity at the domain midpoint $x = 0.5$. The left state $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L)$ fills cells with centers $x  0.5$ and the right state $(\\rho_R, u_R, p_R)$ fills cells with centers $x \\ge 0.5$.

The four test cases are:\n\n- Case A (stationary contact, moderate jump): $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L, \\rho_R, u_R, p_R) = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.125, 0.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case B (stationary contact, strong jump): $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L, \\rho_R, u_R, p_R) = (10.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case C (no discontinuity): $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L, \\rho_R, u_R, p_R) = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)$.\n- Case D (stationary contact, weak jump): $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L, \\rho_R, u_R, p_R) = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.0, 1.0)$.\n\nFor each case, compute a one-step update with HLL and with HLLC. Then return a boolean for the case defined as\n$$\n\\text{result} = \\left(\\Delta \\rho_{\\text{L1}}^{\\text{HLL}} > 10^{-12}\\right) \\wedge \\left(\\Delta \\rho_{\\text{L1}}^{\\text{HLLC}} \\le 10^{-12}\\right).\n$$\nThis boolean should be true for Cases A, B, and D, and false for Case C.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the four test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example $[\\text{true},\\text{false},\\text{true},\\text{true}]$ using the native boolean literals of your language.",

The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem specifies a deterministic, explicit numerical algorithm with all necessary initial conditions, boundary conditions, and parameters. A unique solution for the state after one time step is guaranteed.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is formulated using precise mathematical and algorithmic language, free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All information required for implementation is provided. The grid setup ($N=10$, discontinuity at $x=0.5$) correctly places the initial jump at the interface between cell $5$ and cell $6$. The parameters are physically and numerically consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-posed, complete, and scientifically rigorous problem in computational engineering. We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Principle-Based Solution**\n\nThe objective is to solve the Euler equations, a system of hyperbolic conservation laws, using a finite-volume method. The integral form of the conservation law for a control volume (cell) $[x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}]$ is\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} \\mathbf{U}(x, t) dx + \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}(x_{i+1/2}, t)) - \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}(x_{i-1/2}, t)) = 0\n$$\nAveraging over the cell width $\\Delta x = x_{i+1/2} - x_{i-1/2}$ yields\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathbf{U}_i(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}(x_{i+1/2}, t)) - \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{U}(x_{i-1/2}, t))\\right) = 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{U}_i(t)$ is the cell-averaged state. A first-order explicit time integration from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1} = t^n + \\Delta t$ gives the Godunov update formula:\n$$\n\\mathbf{U}_i^{n+1} = \\mathbf{U}_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\mathbf{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} - \\mathbf{F}_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{F}_{i+1/2}$ is the numerical flux, which must approximate the time-averaged physical flux at the interface. Godunov's method defines this flux using the self-similar solution of the Riemann problem at the interface, evaluated along the line $x/t=0$. The Riemann problem at interface $x_{i+1/2}$ is defined by the initial condition consisting of two constant states, $\\mathbf{U}_L = \\mathbf{U}_i^n$ and $\\mathbf{U}_R = \\mathbf{U}_{i+1}^n$.\n\n**HLL Approximate Riemann Solver**\nThe HLL solver approximates the solution to the Riemann problem with a two-wave model. It assumes the left state $\\mathbf{U}_L$ and right state $\\mathbf{U}_R$ are separated by an intermediate constant state $\\mathbf{U}_*$, bounded by the fastest left-going wave speed $S_L$ and fastest right-going wave speed $S_R$. Integrating the conservation law over the region $[x_L, x_R] \\times [0, T]$ where $x_L  0  x_R$ and applying the divergence theorem gives the integral form of the Rankine-Hugoniot condition. This leads to the HLL state $\\mathbf{U}_* = \\frac{S_R \\mathbf{U}_R - S_L \\mathbf{U}_L - (\\mathbf{F}_R - \\mathbf{F}_L)}{S_R - S_L}$. The numerical flux at the interface $x/t=0$ is then determined by which region of the simplified wave structure contains the interface. This gives the HLL flux, $\\mathbf{F}^{\\text{HLL}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{\\text{HLL}} = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbf{F}_L  \\text{if } 0 \\le S_L \\\\\n\\frac{S_R \\mathbf{F}_L - S_L \\mathbf{F}_R + S_L S_R (\\mathbf{U}_R - \\mathbf{U}_L)}{S_R - S_L}  \\text{if } S_L  0  S_R \\\\\n\\mathbf{F}_R  \\text{if } 0  S_R\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe wave speeds $S_L$ and $S_R$ must bound all physical characteristic speeds. We use the Davis-Yee estimate:\n$$\nS_L = \\min(u_L - a_L, u_R - a_R), \\quad S_R = \\max(u_L + a_L, u_R + a_R)\n$$\nwhere $a_K = \\sqrt{\\gamma p_K / \\rho_K}$ for $K \\in \\{L, R\\}$. The HLL solver is simple and robust but is known to be overly diffusive, particularly for contact discontinuities, as it does not explicitly model them. For a stationary contact ($u_L=u_R=0, p_L=p_R$), the flux has a non-zero mass component if $\\rho_L \\neq \\rho_R$, which introduces spurious velocity and smearing of the density profile.\n\n**HLLC Approximate Riemann Solver**\nThe HLLC solver restores the contact discontinuity and shear waves absent in the HLL model. It assumes a three-wave structure with speeds $S_L$, $S_*$ (contact), and $S_R$, separating four constant states: $\\mathbf{U}_L$, $\\mathbf{U}_{L*}$, $\\mathbf{U}_{R*}$, and $\\mathbf{U}_R$. The wave speeds $S_L$ and $S_R$ are estimated as in HLL. The contact speed $S_*$ and the pressures in the \"star\" regions ($p_{L*} = p_{R*} = p_*$) are found by enforcing the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions across the $S_L$ and $S_R$ waves. This gives:\n$$\nS_* = \\frac{p_R - p_L + \\rho_L u_L(S_L - u_L) - \\rho_R u_R(S_R - u_R)}{\\rho_L (S_L - u_L) - \\rho_R (S_R - u_R)}\n$$\nThe intermediate states $\\mathbf{U}_{K*}$ (for $K \\in \\{L,R\\}$) are then given by applying the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions across the outer waves:\n$$\n\\mathbf{U}_{K*} = \\rho_K \\left(\\frac{S_K - u_K}{S_K - S_*}\\right) \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ S_* \\\\ E_K/\\rho_K + (S_* - u_K)(S_* + p_K/(\\rho_K(S_K-u_K))) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe HLLC flux, $\\mathbf{F}^{\\text{HLLC}}$, is selected based on the location of the interface $x/t=0$ within this wave structure:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{\\text{HLLC}} = \\begin{cases}\n\\mathbf{F}_L  \\text{if } 0 \\le S_L \\\\\n\\mathbf{F}_L + S_L(\\mathbf{U}_{L*} - \\mathbf{U}_L)  \\text{if } S_L  0 \\le S_* \\\\\n\\mathbf{F}_R + S_R(\\mathbf{U}_{R*} - \\mathbf{U}_R)  \\text{if } S_*  0  S_R \\\\\n\\mathbf{F}_R  \\text{if } 0  S_R\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor a stationary contact discontinuity defined by $(\\rho_L, 0, p_0)$ and $(\\rho_R, 0, p_0)$, it can be shown that $S_* = 0$. The HLLC formulation then yields a numerical flux at the contact equal to the physical flux, $\\mathbf{F} = [0, p_0, 0]^T$. Consequently, for any cell, the incoming and outgoing fluxes are identical ($\\mathbf{F}_{i-1/2} = \\mathbf{F}_{i+1/2}$), resulting in $\\mathbf{U}_i^{n+1} = \\mathbf{U}_i^n$. The HLLC solver thus preserves a stationary contact discontinuity exactly, up to machine precision.\n\nThe provided test cases are designed to verify this behavior. Cases A, B, and D are stationary contacts with varying density jumps. The HLL solver is expected to produce a non-zero $\\Delta \\rho_{\\text{L1}}$, while the HLLC solver should produce $\\Delta \\rho_{\\text{L1}} \\approx 0$. Case C is a trivial case with no discontinuity, for which both solvers should yield $\\Delta \\rho_{\\text{L1}} \\approx 0$. The implementation below will quantify these effects.",
