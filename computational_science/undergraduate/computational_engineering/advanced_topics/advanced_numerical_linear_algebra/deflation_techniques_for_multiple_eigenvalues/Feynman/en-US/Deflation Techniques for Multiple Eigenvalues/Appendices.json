The tasks are unambiguous and lead to a unique, verifiable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free from subjective or speculative content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in numerical linear algebra. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Eigenvalue Multiplicity and Eigenvector**\n\nTo determine the eigenvalues of $A$, we compute the characteristic polynomial $p(\\lambda) = \\det(A - \\lambda I)$, where $I$ is the $4 \\times 4$ identity matrix.\n$$\nA - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1-\\lambda & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1-\\lambda & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1-\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 2-\\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince this is an upper triangular matrix, its determinant is the product of its diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = (1-\\lambda)(1-\\lambda)(1-\\lambda)(2-\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)^{3}(2-\\lambda)\n$$\nThe roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$ are the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ with algebraic multiplicity $m_a(\\lambda_1) = 3$, and $\\lambda_2 = 2$ with algebraic multiplicity $m_a(\\lambda_2) = 1$. This verifies that $\\lambda=1$ is an eigenvalue with multiplicity greater than $1$.\n\nNext, we find a right eigenvector $x$ corresponding to $\\lambda=1$ by solving the system $(A - 1 \\cdot I)x = 0$.\n$$\n(A - I)x = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\nx_4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix-vector equation yields the system of linear equations:\n$x_2 = 0$\n$x_3 = 0$\n$x_4 = 0$\nThe variable $x_1$ is a free variable. Thus, any eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda=1$ is of the form $c \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$ for any non-zero scalar $c$. The eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the geometric multiplicity is $m_g(1) = 1$. The problem requires a unit eigenvector $v$. We select the basis vector for the eigenspace and normalize it.\nLet $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$. The Euclidean norm is $\\|x\\|_2 = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = 1$.\nTherefore, a unit right eigenvector is $v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$.\n\n**Part 2: Deflated Matrix and Explanation of Failure**\n\nWe form the deflated matrix $A_{\\mathrm{def}}$ using $\\lambda=1$ and $v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$.\nFirst, we compute the rank-one matrix $v v^{\\top}$:\n$$\nv v^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $A_{\\mathrm{def}} = A - \\lambda v v^{\\top} = A - 1 \\cdot v v^{\\top}$:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{def}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe failure of this deflation method lies in the fact that the matrix $A$ is defective for the eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$. A matrix is defective for an eigenvalue if its algebraic multiplicity is greater than its geometric multiplicity. Here, $m_a(1)=3$ while $m_g(1)=1$.\n\nThis defectiveness implies the existence of a generalized eigenspace of dimension $3$, which is spanned not just by the single eigenvector $v$, but also by two generalized eigenvectors. A generalized eigenvector $x_k$ is a vector in a chain defined by $(A - \\lambda I)x_k = x_{k-1}$, where $x_1$ is the true eigenvector. The space $\\ker((A-\\lambda I)^k)$ for $k > 1$ contains the generalized eigenvectors.\n\nThe standard Hotelling deflation, $A_{\\mathrm{def}} = A - \\lambda v v^{\\top}$, is designed to shift the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ corresponding to the eigenvector $v$ to $0$, such that $A_{\\mathrm{def}}v = (A - \\lambda v v^{\\top})v = Av - \\lambda v(v^{\\top}v) = \\lambda v - \\lambda v(1) = 0$. However, this rank-one modification only utilizes information about the one-dimensional eigenspace spanned by $v$. It does not account for the higher-dimensional structure of the generalized eigenspace (which is an invariant subspace under $A$). The deflation fails to correctly transform the entire Jordan block associated with $\\lambda=1$. Consequently, the influence of the other vectors in the Jordan chain is not removed from the matrix, and the deflated matrix $A_{\\mathrm{def}}$ retains components of the original eigensystem associated with $\\lambda=1$. The goal of deflation is to find eigenvectors for other eigenvalues, but in this defective case, subsequent power iterations on $A_{\\mathrm{def}}$ would converge to another vector within the same generalized eigenspace for $\\lambda=1$.\n\nTo see this explicitly, let's find the eigenvalues of $A_{\\mathrm{def}}$. The characteristic polynomial is $\\det(A_{\\mathrm{def}} - \\mu I)$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\mu & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1-\\mu & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1-\\mu & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 2-\\mu\n\\end{pmatrix} = (-\\mu)(1-\\mu)^2(2-\\mu)\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $A_{\\mathrm{def}}$ are $\\{0, 1, 1, 2\\}$. The original eigenvalues of $A$ were $\\{1, 1, 1, 2\\}$. The deflation only shifted one instance of the eigenvalue $1$ to $0$, while two instances of the eigenvalue $1$ remain. A successful deflation would simplify the eigenproblem, but here it has failed to remove the multiplicity of $\\lambda=1$, which is the primary reason for deflation in the first place.\n\n**Part 3: Final Computation**\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of $\\det(A_{\\mathrm{def}} - \\lambda I)$ with $\\lambda = 1$. This is equivalent to asking for the value of the characteristic polynomial of $A_{\\mathrm{def}}$ at $\\mu=1$. From the analysis above, we know that $1$ is an eigenvalue of $A_{\\mathrm{def}}$. By definition, if $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix $M$, then $\\det(M - \\mu I) = 0$.\n\nLet's compute it directly for completeness.\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{def}} - 1 \\cdot I = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe resulting matrix has a row consisting entirely of zeros (the third row). The determinant of any matrix with a zero row or column is zero.\nTherefore, $\\det(A_{\\mathrm{def}} - I) = 0$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of numerical linear algebra, specifically the analysis of floating-point errors in eigenvalue algorithms. It is well-posed, providing all necessary models and data, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. I shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the ratio, $R(\\varepsilon_{m})$, of the absolute errors in estimating the eigenvalue $\\lambda+\\delta$ using Hotelling's and Wielandt's deflation methods, under the specified finite-precision model.\n\nFirst, we analyze the error for Hotelling's deflation. The method involves the explicit formation of the matrix $\\widehat{A}_{H} = \\operatorname{fl}(A - \\lambda v v^{\\top})$. The problem models this as $\\widehat{A}_{H} = A_{H} + E_{H}$, where $A_{H} = A - \\lambda v v^{\\top}$ is the exact deflated matrix and $E_{H}$ is the perturbation due to floating-point arithmetic. The eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix $A_H$ are $0$ and $\\lambda + \\delta$. We seek to estimate $\\lambda + \\delta$.\n\nAccording to first-order eigenvalue perturbation theory for symmetric matrices, the error in an eigenvalue is bounded by the spectral norm of the perturbation matrix. The problem provides the magnitude of this perturbation as $\\|E_{H}\\|_{2} \\approx c_{H}\\,\\varepsilon_{m}\\,\\lambda$. The absolute error in the Hotelling estimate, which we denote $\\Delta\\lambda_{H}$, is therefore of this order:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{H} \\approx c_{H}\\,\\varepsilon_{m}\\,\\lambda\n$$\nThis error is proportional to the larger eigenvalue $\\lambda$, which is a characteristic result for methods involving subtractive cancellation of large quantities.\n\nNext, we analyze the error for Wielandt's deflation. This method operates on the subspace $\\mathrm{span}\\{v\\}^{\\perp}$ by effectively applying the operator $B = PAP$, where $P = I - vv^{\\top}$. For any vector $x \\in \\mathrm{span}\\{v\\}^{\\perp}$, we have $Px=x$, and thus $Bx = PAx = P((\\lambda+\\delta)x) = (\\lambda+\\delta)x$. The exact operator on this subspace is simple scaling by the desired eigenvalue, $\\lambda+\\delta$.\n\nThe problem provides a refined model for the error in this procedure. It states that while the computed action $\\widehat{B}x$ induces an operator perturbation $\\|\\widehat{B} - B\\|_{2}$ proportional to $\\lambda+\\delta$, the \"effective eigenvalue perturbation\" is much smaller. This is because the projection $P$ nullifies the dominant part of the error associated with the large eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The resulting absolute error in the Wielandt estimate, $\\Delta\\lambda_{W}$, is given to be of the order:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{W} \\approx c_{W}\\,\\varepsilon_{m}\\,\\delta\n$$\nThis error is proportional to the small eigenvalue separation $\\delta$, indicating superior numerical stability.\n\nWe can now form the ratio $R(\\varepsilon_{m})$ of these two absolute errors:\n$$\nR(\\varepsilon_{m}) = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{H}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{W}} \\approx \\frac{c_{H}\\,\\varepsilon_{m}\\,\\lambda}{c_{W}\\,\\varepsilon_{m}\\,\\delta} = \\frac{c_{H}}{c_{W}} \\frac{\\lambda}{\\delta}\n$$\nThe factors $c_{H}$ and $c_{W}$ are described as \"modest constants\" that depend on the details of the floating-point implementation. In a high-level comparison of algorithmic stability, it is standard to assume these constants are of the same order of magnitude, thus we take the approximation $c_{H}/c_{W} \\approx 1$. This is a reasonable step to isolate the structural difference in the error propagation of the two methods. The ratio then simplifies to:\n$$\nR(\\varepsilon_{m}) \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{\\delta}\n$$\nThe problem requires this ratio to be computed for a specific case. The conditions are:\n$1$. The spectral norm of $A$ is normalized: $\\|A\\|_{2} = \\lambda + \\delta = 1$.\n$2$. The eigenvalue separation is equal to the machine epsilon: $\\delta = \\varepsilon_{m}$.\n\nFrom the first condition, we express $\\lambda$ in terms of $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\lambda = 1 - \\delta\n$$\nSubstituting the second condition, $\\delta = \\varepsilon_{m}$, into this expression yields:\n$$\n\\lambda = 1 - \\varepsilon_{m}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute these expressions for $\\lambda$ and $\\delta$ into the formula for the error ratio $R(\\varepsilon_{m})$:\n$$\nR(\\varepsilon_{m}) \\approx \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon_{m}}{\\varepsilon_{m}}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates the significant superiority of Wielandt's deflation over Hotelling's method for finding a small eigenvalue when it is clustered with a large one.

Since $A$ is symmetric and $v_1 v_1^{\\top}$ is symmetric, their sum $B$ is also a real, symmetric matrix. The minimization problem is now transformed into:\n$$\n\\min_{x^{\\top} x = 1} x^{\\top} B x\n$$\nThis is the standard problem of finding the minimum value of the Rayleigh quotient for the matrix $B$. By the Rayleigh-Ritz theorem, for any symmetric matrix $B$, the minimum value of the quotient $\\frac{x^{\\top} B x}{x^{\\top} x}$ is the smallest eigenvalue of $B$, denoted $\\mu_{\\min}(B)$. This minimum is achieved if and only if $x$ is a corresponding eigenvector. Therefore, the vector $x_\\star$ that solves our original minimization problem is the unit-norm eigenvector of $B$ associated with its smallest eigenvalue.\n\nNow, we must understand how this procedure relates to finding the \"next\" eigenvalue of $A$. Let the eigenpairs of $A$ be $(\\lambda_i, u_i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$, ordered such that $\\lambda_1 \\le \\lambda_2 \\le \\dots \\le \\lambda_n$. The vector $v_1$ is given as an approximation to $u_1$.\n\nConsider the ideal case where the approximation is exact, i.e., $v_1 = u_1$. The matrix is $B = A + \\gamma u_1 u_1^{\\top}$. Let us examine the action of $B$ on the eigenvectors of $A$:\n1. For any eigenvector $u_i$ of $A$ with $i > 1$, we assume it is orthogonal to $u_1$ (which is always possible for symmetric matrices, even with repeated eigenvalues). Then $u_1^{\\top} u_i = 0$. Applying $B$ to $u_i$ yields:\n$$\nB u_i = A u_i + \\gamma u_1 (u_1^{\\top} u_i) = \\lambda_i u_i + \\gamma u_1 (0) = \\lambda_i u_i\n$$\nThis shows that $(\\lambda_i, u_i)$ for $i=2, \\dots, n$ are also eigenpairs of $B$.\n\n2. For the eigenvector $u_1$, we have $u_1^{\\top} u_1 = 1$ since it is a unit vector. Applying $B$ to $u_1$ gives:\n$$\nB u_1 = A u_1 + \\gamma u_1 (u_1^{\\top} u_1) = \\lambda_1 u_1 + \\gamma u_1(1) = (\\lambda_1 + \\gamma) u_1\n$$\nSo, $(\\lambda_1 + \\gamma, u_1)$ is an eigenpair of $B$.\n\nThe spectrum of $B$ is therefore $\\{\\lambda_1 + \\gamma, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\dots, \\lambda_n\\}$. The purpose of the penalty term is to \"shift\" the eigenvalue corresponding to the known eigenvector direction $u_1$ upwards, exposing the next eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2$, as the minimum. For this to occur, the smallest eigenvalue of $B$ must be $\\lambda_2$. This requires that $\\lambda_2 < \\lambda_1 + \\gamma$. Rearranging, the penalty parameter $\\gamma$ must be chosen to satisfy $\\gamma > \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1$. If this condition holds, the smallest eigenvalue of $B$ is $\\lambda_2$, and its corresponding eigenvector is $u_2$.\n\nIn the general case where $v_1$ is only an approximation to $u_1$, the eigenvectors of $A$ (other than $u_1$) are not exactly eigenvectors of $B$. However, for a sufficiently large $\\gamma$, the eigenvalue of $B$ associated with the direction $v_1$ is significantly increased. The eigenvector $x_\\star$ corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of $B$ will then be an approximation of $u_2$, the eigenvector of $A$ for the second-smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$. The quality of this approximation depends on the accuracy of $v_1$ and the gap between eigenvalues.\n\nFinally, to obtain a numerical estimate $\\widehat{\\lambda}_2$ of the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$, we use the vector $x_\\star$ we have found. The best estimate for an eigenvalue of $A$ given an approximate eigenvector $x_\\star$ is its Rayleigh quotient with respect to $A$. As $x_\\star$ is a unit vector, this is simply:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\lambda}_2 = x_\\star^{\\top} A x_\\star\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. The algorithm is precisely as stated in the problem: construct $B = A + \\gamma v_1 v_1^{\\top}$, find the eigenvector $x_\\star$ corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of $B$, and compute the Rayleigh quotient $\\widehat{\\lambda}_2 = x_\\star^{\\top} A x_\\star$ as the desired estimate. Test $5$ demonstrates the failure of the method when $\\gamma$ is too small to satisfy the condition $\\gamma > \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1$, in which case the minimizer $x_\\star$ remains aligned with the direction of $v_1$ instead of shifting to approximate $u_2$.",
