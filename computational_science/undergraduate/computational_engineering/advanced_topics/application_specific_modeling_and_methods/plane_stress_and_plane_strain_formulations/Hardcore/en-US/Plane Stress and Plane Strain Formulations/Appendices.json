            "problem": "A homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic solid occupies a region subjected to a two-dimensional loading such that the state is one of plane strain in the out-of-plane direction $z$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\nGivens are extracted verbatim as follows:\n- The state is one of plane strain in the out-of-plane direction $z$.\n- The solid is homogeneous, isotropic, and linearly elastic.\n- In-plane Cauchy stress components are $\\sigma_{xx} = 120$ MPa, $\\sigma_{yy} = -30$ MPa, and $\\tau_{xy} = 25$ MPa.\n- Material properties are Young’s modulus $E = 200$ GPa and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu = 0.31$.\n- Assumptions include infinitesimal strains and no thermal strains.\n- The objective is to determine the out-of-plane normal stress $\\sigma_{zz}$.\n\nValidation is performed based on these givens. The problem is a standard application of the theory of linear elasticity for an isotropic material. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided information is sufficient to determine the requested quantity, $\\sigma_{zz}$. The material properties are physically realistic for a material like steel. The stress values are within plausible elastic limits. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles of physics or mathematics. It is not incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous. The presence of Young's modulus $E$ and the shear stress $\\tau_{xy}$ are extraneous for the specific calculation of $\\sigma_{zz}$, but they do not invalidate the problem; they would be necessary for computing the full strain tensor. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution may be pursued.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the fundamental principles of constitutive modeling for a linearly elastic, isotropic material under infinitesimal strains. The relationship between the strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$ and the stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ is given by generalized Hooke's Law. The normal strain components are expressed as:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{xx} - \\nu (\\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{yy} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{zz}) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) ] $$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio.\n\nThe key condition is that of plane strain in the $z$-direction. By definition, this means that all strain components associated with the out-of-plane direction are zero. Specifically:\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = 0, \\quad \\epsilon_{xz} = 0, \\quad \\epsilon_{yz} = 0 $$\nThe conditions $\\epsilon_{xz} = 0$ and $\\epsilon_{yz} = 0$ enforce that the corresponding shear stresses $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$ are also zero for an isotropic material, which is consistent with the problem statement as only in-plane stresses are given.\n\nThe condition for the out-of-plane normal strain, $\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$, is used to find $\\sigma_{zz}$. Substituting this into the constitutive equation for $\\epsilon_{zz}$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) ] = 0 $$\nSince the material is elastic, its Young's modulus $E$ is a finite, non-zero positive constant. Thus, for the equation to hold, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) = 0 $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the out-of-plane normal stress $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) $$\nThis result shows that under plane strain conditions, a non-zero out-of-plane normal stress generally develops to enforce the constraint of zero out-of-plane normal strain. This stress is proportional to the sum of the in-plane normal stresses.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The data provided are:\n- Poisson’s ratio, $\\nu = 0.31$\n- In-plane normal stress, $\\sigma_{xx} = 120$ MPa\n- In-plane normal stress, $\\sigma_{yy} = -30$ MPa\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = 0.31 \\times (120 + (-30)) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = 0.31 \\times (90) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = 27.9 \\text{ MPa} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in MPa and rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $27.9$. To present this value with four significant figures, it is written as $27.90$.",

We will derive this for plane stress and plane strain conditions.\n\nFirst, we consider the case of plane stress.\nThe defining condition for plane stress is that the stress components normal to the $x$-$y$ plane are zero. This means $\\sigma_{zz} = \\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$. Applying this to the general $3$D compliance matrix allows us to extract the in-plane relationships:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} ( \\sigma_{xx} - \\nu \\sigma_{yy} ) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} ( -\\nu \\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} ) $$\n$$ \\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{2(1+\\nu)}{E} \\tau_{xy} $$\nIn matrix form using Voigt notation, this is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\epsilon_{xx} \\\\\n\\epsilon_{yy} \\\\\n\\gamma_{xy}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\frac{1}{E}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\nu & 0 \\\\\n-\\nu & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2(1+\\nu)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma_{xx} \\\\\n\\sigma_{yy} \\\\\n\\tau_{xy}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe plane stress stiffness matrix, $\\boldsymbol{D}^{\\text{(plane stress)}}$, is obtained by inverting this compliance matrix.
