            "solution": "The problem presented is a canonical exercise in computational physics, specifically concerning the numerical integration of Hamiltonian systems. It requires a comparative analysis of two different integration algorithms: the Velocity Verlet method, which belongs to the class of second-order symplectic integrators, and the classical explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method, a general-purpose non-symplectic scheme. The purpose is to evaluate their performance on a one-dimensional, two-particle system governed by a steep repulsive potential. The evaluation is based on standard metrics for numerical integrators: conservation of energy, accuracy of phase-space trajectory, and time-reversibility. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary parameters and initial conditions for a complete solution.\n\nThe system is described by the Hamiltonian in reduced units ($m=1, \\varepsilon=1, \\sigma=1$):\n$$\nH(x_1, x_2, p_1, p_2) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}(p_1^2 + p_2^2) + V(x_2 - x_1)\n$$\nwhere $p_i = v_i$ are the canonical momenta (since $m=1$), and the potential energy is given by:\n$$\nV(r) \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r^2+\\delta^2}}\\right)^{12} \\;=\\; (r^2+\\delta^2)^{-6}\n$$\nwith $r=x_2-x_1$ being the signed separation and $\\delta=10^{-2}$ a softening parameter.\n\nHamilton's equations of motion are $\\dot{x}_i = \\partial H / \\partial p_i$ and $\\dot{p}_i = -\\partial H / \\partial x_i$.

Its key feature for Hamiltonian systems is the long-term conservation of a nearby \"shadow\" Hamiltonian, which prevents secular energy drift. For a time step $\\Delta t$, the state is advanced from time $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ via three steps:\n    1.  Update velocities by half a step: $v_i(t + \\Delta t/2) = v_i(t) + \\frac{1}{2} a_i(\\mathbf{x}(t)) \\Delta t$.\n    2.  Update positions by a full step: $x_i(t + \\Delta t) = x_i(t) + v_i(t + \\Delta t/2) \\Delta t$.\n    3.  Compute new accelerations $a_i(\\mathbf{x}(t+\\Delta t))$ and update velocities for the second half-step: $v_i(t + \\Delta t) = v_i(t + \\Delta t/2) + \\frac{1}{2} a_i(\\mathbf{x}(t + \\Delta t)) \\Delta t$.\n\n2.  **Classical Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) Algorithm**: This is a widely used, high-accuracy, general-purpose integrator. It is not symplectic and not time-reversible. It typically exhibits superior accuracy for a given step size over short integration periods but suffers from systematic energy drift in long-term simulations of Hamiltonian systems. For a system of ODEs $\\dot{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{f}(t, \\mathbf{y})$, where the state vector is $\\mathbf{y} = (x_1, x_2, v_1, v_2)^T$, the update from $\\mathbf{y}_n$ to $\\mathbf{y}_{n+1}$ is:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{k}_1 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n, \\mathbf{y}_n)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{k}_2 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\mathbf{k}_1)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{k}_3 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\mathbf{k}_2)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{k}_4 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + \\Delta t, \\mathbf{y}_n + \\Delta t \\mathbf{k}_3)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6}(\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4)\n    $$\n    Here, the derivative function is $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{y}) = (v_1, v_2, a_1(x_1,x_2), a_2(x_1,x_2))^T$.\n\nFor each integrator and for each specified time step $\\Delta t \\in \\{0.02, 0.005, 0.0005\\}$, four diagnostic quantities are computed:\n- **Absolute terminal energy error**: $|H(T) - H(0)|$. For a symplectic integrator, this is expected to be small but may not be minimal, as the error is oscillatory. For RK4, this error is expected to show drift, growing over time.\n- **Maximum relative energy error**: $\\max_{0 \\le t \\le T} |H(t) - H(0)| / |H(0)|$. This measures the peak deviation of energy over the entire trajectory.\n- **Velocity swap error**: $E_{\\mathrm{swap}} = \\sqrt{(v_1(T) - v_1^\\star)^2 + (v_2(T) - v_2^\\star)^2}$, where $(v_1^\\star, v_2^\\star)=(-0.8, 0.8)$ are the expected final velocities for an ideal elastic collision. This metric quantifies the accuracy of the phase-space trajectory.\n- **Time-reversibility error**: $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. This is computed by integrating forward to time $T$ and then backward to time $0$ using a negative step size $-\\Delta t$. The error is the norm of the deviation of the final state from the initial one. A time-reversible algorithm like Verlet should yield a very small error, close to machine precision, whereas a non-reversible algorithm like RK4 will show a significant error that scales with $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe calculations are performed according to these principles, and the results are aggregated as specified.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in computational mechanics, free of scientific or logical inconsistencies. It provides all necessary data and defines a clear, objective task.\n\nThe system under consideration is a point mass with mass $m=1$ constrained to move on the surface of a unit sphere, described by the holonomic constraint $g(q) = q(t)^{\\top}q(t) - 1 = 0$. There is no external potential, so the Lagrangian is purely kinetic: $L(q, \\dot{q}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}^{\\top}\\dot{q}$. The equations of motion are derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations for a constrained system, $\\ddot{q} = \\lambda \\nabla_q g(q)$, where $\\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint. Differentiating the constraint twice with respect to time yields $q^{\\top}\\ddot{q} + \\dot{q}^{\\top}\\dot{q} = 0$. Substituting the equation of motion and using $q^{\\top} q=1$, we find the Lagrange multiplier to be $\\lambda = -\\dot{q}^{\\top}\\dot{q}$. Thus, the continuous equation of motion is:\n$$ \\ddot{q} = -(\\dot{q}^{\\top}\\dot{q}) q $$\nThis equation describes geodesic motion on the sphere. The trajectory of the point mass follows a great circle.\n\nThe problem requires a time integrator that exactly conserves three quantities:\n$1$. The geometric constraint: $\\lVert q(t) \\rVert = 1$.\n$2$. The mechanical energy: $E(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}(t)^{\\top}\\dot{q}(t) = E(0)$.\n$3$. The angular momentum vector: $L(t) = q(t) \\times \\dot{q}(t) = L(0)$.\n\nStandard numerical integrators like Euler or Verlet methods do not satisfy these strict conservation properties for this system. It is necessary to construct an integrator based on the exact solution of the equations of motion. The exact solution for geodesic flow on a sphere is a rotation.\n\nLet the state at time $t_n$ be $(q_n, \\dot{q}_n)$. Let $\\omega_n = \\lVert \\dot{q}_n \\rVert$ be the speed. The energy is $E_n = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_n^2$. If $\\omega_n = 0$, the particle is at rest and will remain so for all future times. If $\\omega_n > 0$, the motion occurs in the plane spanned by the orthonormal vectors $q_n$ and $v_n = \\dot{q}_n / \\omega_n$. The initial condition $q(0)^{\\top}\\dot{q}(0)=0$ ensures these vectors are orthogonal, and the dynamics preserve this property, as $d/dt(q^{\\top}\\dot{q}) = \\dot{q}^{\\top}\\dot{q} + q^{\\top}\\ddot{q} = \\|\\dot{q}\\|^2 - \\|\\dot{q}\\|^2 \\|q\\|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe exact trajectory starting from $q_n$ with velocity $\\dot{q}_n$ is given by Rodrigues' rotation formula, describing a rotation along a great circle:\n$$ q(t_n + \\tau) = q_n \\cos(\\omega_n \\tau) + v_n \\sin(\\omega_n \\tau) $$\nThe velocity is its time derivative:\n$$ \\dot{q}(t_n + \\tau) = -\\omega_n \\sin(\\omega_n \\tau) q_n + \\omega_n \\cos(\\omega_n \\tau) v_n $$\nThis analytical solution provides an exact map from the state at $t_n$ to the state at $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$.

Given the state $(q_n, \\dot{q}_n)$, calculate the speed $\\omega_n = \\lVert \\dot{q}_n \\rVert$.\n$2$.

Each test case specifies $(M,k,\\mu,N,\\Delta t, \\text{steps}, x_0, v_0)$:\n- Test $1$ (general sliding and sticking): $(M,k,\\mu,N,\\Delta t,\\text{steps},x_0,v_0) = (1.0, 50.0, 0.2, 1.5, 0.005, 4000, 0.1, 0.0)$.\n- Test $2$ (purely conservative limit): $(M,k,\\mu,N,\\Delta t,\\text{steps},x_0,v_0) = (1.0, 50.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.005, 4000, 0.1, 0.2)$.\n- Test $3$ (threshold edge in one step, no spring): $(M,k,\\mu,N,\\Delta t,\\text{steps},x_0,v_0) = (1.0, 0.0, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1, 0.0, 0.4)$.\n- Test $4$ (friction-only glide and stop): $(M,k,\\mu,N,\\Delta t,\\text{steps},x_0,v_0) = (1.0, 0.0, 0.05, 1.0, 0.01, 1000, 0.0, 1.0)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[$r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4$]\"), where $r_i$ is the maximum absolute discrete energy-balance violation for test $i$ as defined above.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, presenting a standard problem in computational mechanics. We will now proceed with the derivation of the required numerical integrator.\n\nThe objective is to construct a time-stepping scheme for the equation of motion $M \\ddot{x}(t) + k x(t) + f_{\\mathrm{fric}}(\\dot{x}(t)) = 0$ that satisfies a discrete energy balance by design. The foundation of the derivation is the discrete work-energy principle over a time interval $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$, where $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$.\n\nThe change in kinetic energy from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$ is equal to the total work done by all forces.\n$$\n\\Delta K^{(n)} = K_{n+1} - K_n = W_{\\mathrm{cons}}^{(n)} + W_{\\mathrm{fric,force}}^{(n)}\n$$\nwhere $K_n = \\frac{1}{2} M v_n^2$ is the kinetic energy, $W_{\\mathrm{cons}}^{(n)}$ is the work done by the conservative spring force, and $W_{\\mathrm{fric,force}}^{(n)}$ is the work done by the friction force. The conservative work is the negative change in potential energy, $W_{\\mathrm{cons}}^{(n)} = -(U_{n+1} - U_n)$, where $U_n = \\frac{1}{2} k x_n^2$. The work of the friction force leads to energy dissipation. Let $W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)}$ be the energy dissipated by friction over the step, which is the negative of the work done by the friction force, $W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = -W_{\\mathrm{fric,force}}^{(n)}$. Substituting these definitions yields:\n$$\n(K_{n+1} + U_{n+1}) - (K_n + U_n) + W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = 0\n$$\n$$\nE_{n+1} - E_n + W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = 0\n$$\nThis is the target discrete energy balance equation. Our task is to define the integrator updates and $W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)}$ such that this equation holds true.\n\nWe employ midpoint approximations for kinematics, as specified. The state at the midpoint of the interval, denoted by subscript $n+1/2$, is defined as:\n$$\nx_{n+1/2} = \\frac{x_n + x_{n+1}}{2}, \\quad v_{n+1/2} = \\frac{v_n + v_{n+1}}{2}\n$$\nThese imply the update rule for position:\n$$\nx_{n+1} - x_n = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\dot{x}(t) \\, dt \\approx v_{n+1/2} \\Delta t\n$$\nNow, we rewrite the energy balance equation by factoring the difference of squares:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} M (v_{n+1} - v_n)(v_{n+1} + v_n) + \\frac{1}{2} k (x_{n+1} - x_n)(x_{n+1} + x_n) + W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the midpoint kinematic definitions:\n$$\nM (v_{n+1} - v_n) v_{n+1/2} + k (v_{n+1/2} \\Delta t) x_{n+1/2} + W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = 0\n$$\nFactoring out the midpoint velocity $v_{n+1/2}$ gives:\n$$\nv_{n+1/2} \\left[ M(v_{n+1} - v_n) + k x_{n+1/2} \\Delta t \\right] + W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = 0\n$$\nThis equation links the energy balance to the momentum balance. The discrete momentum balance is obtained by integrating the equation of motion over the time step, using a midpoint rule for the conservative force and defining a friction impulse $I_f^{(n)}$:\n$$\nM(v_{n+1} - v_n) = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} (-k x(t) - f_{\\mathrm{fric}}(\\dot{x}(t))) dt \\approx -k x_{n+1/2} \\Delta t - I_f^{(n)}\n$$\nwhere $I_f^{(n)} = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f_{\\mathrm{fric}}(\\dot{x}(t)) dt$. This gives the discrete momentum equation:\n$$\nM(v_{n+1} - v_n) + k x_{n+1/2} \\Delta t + I_f^{(n)} = 0\n$$\nThe term in the square brackets in the energy equation is precisely $-I_f^{(n)}$ from the momentum equation. Substituting this provides a definition for the dissipated energy:\n$$\nv_{n+1/2} [-I_f^{(n)}] + W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = 0 \\implies W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = I_f^{(n)} v_{n+1/2}\n$$\nWith this definition, the discrete energy balance is satisfied by construction. The remaining task is to solve for the unknowns at each step. The system is defined by the update rules and the friction law. We first express all unknowns in terms of the midpoint velocity $v_{n+1/2}$ and the friction impulse $I_f^{(n)}$.\nFrom midpoint kinematics, we have $v_{n+1} = 2 v_{n+1/2} - v_n$ and $x_{n+1/2} = x_n + \\frac{1}{2} v_{n+1/2} \\Delta t$. Substituting these into the momentum equation yields:\n$$\nM((2v_{n+1/2} - v_n) - v_n) + k (x_n + \\frac{1}{2} v_{n+1/2} \\Delta t) \\Delta t + I_f^{(n)} = 0\n$$\n$$\n2M(v_{n+1/2} - v_n) + k x_n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta t)^2 v_{n+1/2} + I_f^{(n)} = 0\n$$\nGrouping terms with $v_{n+1/2}$:\n$$\n\\left( 2M + \\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta t)^2 \\right) v_{n+1/2} + I_f^{(n)} = 2M v_n - k x_n \\Delta t\n$$\nLet us define $A = 2M + \\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta t)^2$ and $B = 2M v_n - k x_n \\Delta t$. The equation becomes a compact algebraic relation:\n$$\nA v_{n+1/2} + I_f^{(n)} = B\n$$\nThe friction impulse $I_f^{(n)}$ must be consistent with the set-valued Coulomb law, which we apply at the midpoint: $I_f^{(n)} \\in (\\mu N \\Delta t) \\cdot \\mathrm{Sign}(v_{n+1/2})$. Let $P_f = \\mu N \\Delta t$ be the magnitude of the limit friction impulse. The law becomes $I_f^{(n)} \\in P_f \\cdot \\mathrm{Sign}(v_{n+1/2})$, which implies:\n1.  If $v_{n+1/2} > 0$, then $I_f^{(n)} = P_f$.\n2.  If $v_{n+1/2} < 0$, then $I_f^{(n)} = -P_f$.\n3.  If $v_{n+1/2} = 0$, then $I_f^{(n)} \\in [-P_f, P_f]$. This is the stick condition.\n\nWe can solve for $v_{n+1/2}$ and $I_f^{(n)}$ by analyzing these cases. The quantity $B$ represents the impulse required from friction to enforce a sticking condition ($v_{n+1/2}=0$).\n- If this required sticking impulse $B$ is greater than the available friction impulse $P_f$ (i.e., $B > P_f$), the system must slide. The trial motion is positive (since $A v_{n+1/2} = B > 0$ if friction were zero), so the kinetic friction impulse must be $I_f^{(n)} = P_f$. This gives $A v_{n+1/2} + P_f = B$, so $v_{n+1/2} = (B - P_f)/A$. The result is positive, which is consistent.\n- If $B < -P_f$, the system must slide in the negative direction. The friction impulse is $I_f^{(n)} = -P_f$. This gives $A v_{n+1/2} - P_f = B$, so $v_{n+1/2} = (B + P_f)/A$. The result is negative, which is consistent.\n- If $|B| \\le P_f$, the required sticking impulse is within the capacity of static friction. The system sticks, so $v_{n+1/2} = 0$. The momentum balance then gives $I_f^{(n)} = B$. This is consistent with the stick condition $I_f^{(n)} \\in [-P_f, P_f]$.\n\nThe complete algorithm for a single time step from state $(x_n, v_n)$ to $(x_{n+1}, v_{n+1})$ is as follows:\n1.  Calculate auxiliary constants: $A = 2M + \\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta t)^2$ and $P_f = \\mu N \\Delta t$.\n2.  Calculate the trial impulse: $B = 2M v_n - k x_n \\Delta t$.\n3.  Determine the friction state and solve for $v_{n+1/2}$ and $I_f^{(n)}$:\n    - If $B > P_f$: $I_f^{(n)} = P_f$ and $v_{n+1/2} = (B - P_f) / A$.\n    - Else if $B < -P_f$: $I_f^{(n)} = -P_f$ and $v_{n+1/2} = (B + P_f) / A$.\n    - Else: $I_f^{(n)} = B$ and $v_{n+1/2} = 0$.\n4.  Update the state variables: $v_{n+1} = 2 v_{n+1/2} - v_n$ and $x_{n+1} = x_n + v_{n+1/2} \\Delta t$.\n5.  For verification, calculate the energy balance violation:\n    $E_n = \\frac{1}{2} M v_n^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x_n^2$\n    $E_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} M v_{n+1}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x_{n+1}^2$\n    $W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)} = I_f^{(n)} v_{n+1/2}$\n    The violation is $|E_{n+1} - E_n + W_{\\mathrm{fric}}^{(n)}|$.\n\nThis algorithm is implemented for each test case to find the maximum violation over the simulation period.
