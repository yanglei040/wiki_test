By extending this model from one to two dimensions, we can explore the concept of degeneracy, a key feature in quantum systems where multiple distinct quantum states possess the exact same energy. This practice  challenges you to determine the degeneracy of a specific energy level for a particle in a square box, honing your ability to connect energy eigenvalues to their underlying quantum numbers.",
