While the one-dimensional particle-in-a-box is a foundational model, extending it to higher dimensions uncovers new phenomena like degeneracy, where multiple distinct quantum states share the same energy. This practice  challenges you to explore this concept by determining the degeneracy of a specific energy level for a particle in a two-dimensional square box, connecting a simple mathematical inquiry to a profound quantum mechanical property relevant in fields like materials science and spectroscopy.",

This is physically consistent. The wavefunctions $\\psi_n^{(0)}(x)$ for even $n$ have a node at the center of the box, $x=L/2$. The probability density $|\\psi_n^{(0)}(L/2)|^2$ is zero, so the particle is never found at the location of the delta-function barrier. Consequently, the energy of these states is not affected by the perturbation to first order.\n\nFor odd values of $n$ (i.e., $n = 1, 3, 5, \\ldots$), let $n=2k-1$ where $k$ is a positive integer.\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{(2k-1)\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\pm 1\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1\n$$\nFor odd $n$, the energy shift is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_n = \\frac{2\\lambda}{L}\n$$\nThis is also physically consistent. The wavefunctions for odd $n$ have an antinode (maximum amplitude) at the center of the box, $x=L/2$. Therefore, the particle has the highest probability of interacting with the barrier, leading to a non-zero energy shift. Assuming $\\lambda > 0$ (a repulsive barrier), the energy of these states increases.\n\nThe expression $\\Delta E_n = \\frac{2\\lambda}{L} \\sin^2(\\frac{n\\pi}{2})$ correctly captures both cases in a single closed form.",
