            "introduction": "The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is built on the vast difference in mass between electrons and nuclei, which leads to a dramatic separation in their characteristic timescales of motion. This practice provides a tangible check on this core principle by using real experimental data for a familiar molecule, water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$). By calculating the ratio of the timescale for nuclear vibration to that of electronic excitation, you can quantitatively appreciate just how much faster electrons move, providing a solid, data-driven justification for treating nuclear and electronic motions separately .",

The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is a central concept in quantum chemistry, and analyzing the separation of timescales is a standard method to justify it. The provided data for water are physically realistic. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and clear definitions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free from any scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Born-Oppenheimer approximation is justified by the large disparity between the mass of an electron and the mass of atomic nuclei. This mass difference leads to a separation of timescales: electronic motion is much faster than nuclear motion (vibration and rotation). The problem requires a quantitative verification of this separation for a specific case, the water molecule $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nFirst, we define the characteristic time for electronic motion, $\\tau_e$. A natural choice for this timescale is derived from the lowest electronic excitation energy, $\\Delta E$, through the fundamental Planck-Einstein relation, $\\Delta E = h \\nu_e$, where $\\nu_e$ is the frequency of a photon with this energy. The characteristic time is the period corresponding to this frequency:\n$$\n\\tau_e = \\frac{1}{\\nu_e} = \\frac{h}{\\Delta E}\n$$\n\nNext, we define the characteristic time for nuclear motion, specifically the bending vibration, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}}$. This is simply the period of the vibration. We are given the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$. The relationship between wavenumber, frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}}$, and the speed of light $c$ is $\\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}} = c \\tilde{\\nu}$. The period of this vibration is the inverse of its frequency:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}} = \\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}}} = \\frac{1}{c \\tilde{\\nu}}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{\\tau_{e}} = \\frac{1 / (c \\tilde{\\nu})}{h / \\Delta E} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}\n$$\nThis ratio directly compares the energy of electronic excitation to the energy of a vibrational quantum. This is equivalent to comparing the associated timescales.\n\nTo perform the calculation, we must ensure all quantities are in a consistent system of units, for which we will use the International System of Units (SI) for energy (Joules, $J$). The given constants are:\n$\\Delta E = 7.0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n$\\tilde{\\nu} = 1595\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s}$\n$c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}$\n$1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n\nWe first convert the electronic excitation energy $\\Delta E$ from electronvolts to joules:\n$$\n\\Delta E = 7.0 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}) = 1.1215236438 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{J}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator term, $h c \\tilde{\\nu}$, which represents the energy of one quantum of the bending vibration. The units are $(\\mathrm{J\\,s}) \\times (\\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}) = \\mathrm{J}$, so the units are consistent for an energy calculation.\n$$\nh c \\tilde{\\nu} = (6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s}) \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (1595\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nh c \\tilde{\\nu} \\approx (1.98644586 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,cm}) \\times (1595\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nh c \\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3.168381147 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1.1215236438 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{3.168381147 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J}} \\approx 35.39719\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 35.4\n$$\nThe fact that $R$ is significantly greater than $1$ provides a quantitative justification for the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in this case. The nuclear motion is approximately $35$ times slower than the electronic motion, allowing the electronic state to adapt quasi-instantaneously to changes in nuclear geometry.",
