It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and represents a standard problem in computational chemistry concerning the estimation of conformational entropy changes upon ligand binding. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and equations for a unique solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the application of the Gibbs entropy formula within the canonical ensemble. For a single torsional degree of freedom (a rotor) with a discrete set of microstates, indexed by $i$, each with energy $E_i$, the entropy at a given temperature $T$ is calculated.\n\nFirst, we define the inverse thermal energy $\\beta = 1/(R T)$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant, given as $R=8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.

Therefore, the total conformational entropy of the ligand, which has $N_{\\mathrm{rot}}$ rotors, is the sum of the individual rotor entropies:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{total}} = N_{\\mathrm{rot}} \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{rotor}} $$\nThis quantity must be computed for both the unbound and bound states.\n\nFor the unbound state, the set of microstates includes all given energy levels $\\{E_i\\}$. Let us denote the corresponding rotor entropy as $S_{\\mathrm{unbound, rotor}}$. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n$1$. Compute the partition function $Z_{\\mathrm{unbound}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{all}} \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$.\n$2$.

Compute the partition function for the bound state, $Z_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{bound}}} \\exp(-\\beta E_j)$.\n$2$.

For the entire ligand:\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{conf}} = N_{\\mathrm{rot}} (S_{\\mathrm{unbound, rotor}} - S_{\\mathrm{bound, rotor}}) $$\nThe corresponding entropic free-energy penalty at temperature $T$ is:\n$$ T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{conf}} = T \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{rot}} \\cdot (S_{\\mathrm{unbound, rotor}} - S_{\\mathrm{bound, rotor}}) $$\nThe final result is required in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, so the value computed in $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ must be divided by $1000$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n$1$. Define a function to compute the per-rotor entropy for a given list of energy levels (in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$) and temperature $T$.\n    a. Inside this function, handle the trivial case where the number of states is less than or equal to $1$, returning an entropy of $0$.\n    b. Convert energies to $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n    c. Calculate $\\beta = 1/(R T)$.\n    d. Compute the Boltzmann factors $\\exp(-\\beta E_i)$ and sum them to obtain the partition function $Z$.\n    e. Compute probabilities $p_i = \\exp(-\\beta E_i) / Z$.\n    f. To avoid numerical issues with $\\ln(0)$, the sum for entropy is taken only over terms where $p_i > 0$. The entropy is then $-R \\sum p_i \\ln p_i$.\n$2$.

Apply the function to the subset of energies corresponding to the allowed bound-state indices to get $S_{\\mathrm{bound, rotor}}$.\n$4$. Calculate the final penalty $T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{conf}} = T \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{rot}} \\cdot (S_{\\mathrm{unbound, rotor}} - S_{\\mathrm{bound, rotor}})$.\n$5$.

The goal is clear and specific, requiring a quantitative comparison of computational methodologies. The problem does not violate any principles of physics, chemistry, or mathematics. It is not incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to computationally determine the effect of the D$35$N mutation on the folding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}(T)$, and relate this to the observed change in melting temperature, $\\Delta T_m$. The change in folding stability due to the mutation is given by $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}(T) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold, MUT}}(T) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold, WT}}(T)$, where WT refers to the wild type (with Asp$35$) and MUT refers to the mutant (with Asn$35$). A negative value of $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ indicates stabilization.\n\nThe most rigorous and computationally efficient method to calculate $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ is through a non-physical, or alchemical, thermodynamic cycle:\n\n$$\n\\begin{CD}\n\\text{WT}_{\\text{(Native)}} @>{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold, WT}}}>> \\text{WT}_{\\text{(Unfolded)}} \\\\\n@V{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut, N}}}VV @VV{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut, U}}}V \\\\\n\\text{MUT}_{\\text{(Native)}} @>>{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold, MUT}}}> \\text{MUT}_{\\text{(Unfolded)}}\n\\end{CD}\n$$\n\nBased on this cycle, since Gibbs free energy is a state function, we have $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold, WT}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut, U}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut, N}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold, MUT}}$. Rearranging gives the desired quantity:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold, MUT}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold, WT}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut, U}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut, N}}\n$$\nThus, the problem boils down to calculating the free energy of mutating Asp$35$ to Asn$35$ in the solvated native ensemble ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut, N}}$) and in a solvated unfolded reference ensemble ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mut, U}}$). The experimental conditions ($pH\\,7.0$, $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ NaCl) are critical. The D$35$N mutation involves a change of a negatively charged residue (Asp, pKa $\\approx 3.9$) to a neutral polar residue (Asn) at $pH\\,7.0$. This charge change makes an accurate treatment of electrostatics, including solvent screening and specific ion effects, paramount.\n\nThe relationship between the change in folding free energy and the change in melting temperature can be approximated by:\n$$\n\\Delta T_m = T_{m, \\mathrm{MUT}} - T_{m, \\mathrm{WT}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}(T_m)}{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fold}}(T_m)} = \\frac{T_m \\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}(T_m)}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fold}}(T_m)}\n$$\nwhere $T_m$ is the melting temperature of the wild-type protein, and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ are the enthalpy and entropy of folding, respectively. A quantitative protocol must be able to compute $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ at relevant temperatures to use this relation or predict $\\Delta T_m$ from the temperature dependence of $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Perform an alchemical mutation thermodynamic cycle using Thermodynamic Integration (TI) or Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) in explicit solvent, mutating Asp$35$ to Asn$35$ separately in the native ensemble and in an unfolded reference ensemble, at several temperatures bracketing the experimental $T_m$. Use Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD) to allow protonation state sampling at $pH\\,7.0$ and include $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ salt. From the temperature dependence of $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}(T)$, estimate enthalpic and entropic contributions and predict the shift in $T_m$.**\nThis protocol is the most rigorous and comprehensive.\n1.  It correctly proposes using an alchemical thermodynamic cycle with established methods like TI or FEP to directly compute $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, which is the correct thermodynamic quantity.\n2.  It specifies using an explicit solvent model with $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ salt, which is essential for accurately modeling the electrostatic effects of the charge-changing D$35$N mutation and matching the experimental conditions.\n3.  It proposes using Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD), the most physically accurate method to model the system at a fixed $pH$ of $7.0$. This correctly allows the protonation state of titratable residues, including the mutating Asp$35$, to be determined by the simulation environment, accounting for pKa shifts.\n4.  It correctly identifies the need to perform the mutation in both the native and an unfolded reference ensemble to complete the thermodynamic cycle.\n5.  It includes simulations at multiple temperatures, which allows for calculation of the enthalpic ($\\Delta \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fold}}$) and entropic ($\\Delta \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{fold}}$) components of the stability change, and provides the most robust way to predict the shift in $T_m$.\n\nThis protocol directly addresses every requirement of the problem statement with the highest level of theoretical and computational rigor.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Run short vacuum Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations at elevated temperature (e.g., $500\\,\\mathrm{K}$) for the wild type and mutant and compare time-averaged root-mean-square deviation. Infer that the structure with lower root-mean-square deviation is more stable and thus rationalize the increase in $T_m$.**\nThis protocol is fundamentally flawed.\n1.  **Vacuum simulation**: Proteins are not stable in vacuum, and their folding thermodynamics are dominated by interactions with the aqueous solvent. A vacuum simulation is wholly inappropriate for this problem, especially given the charge change and specified ionic strength.\n2.  **RMSD as a stability metric**: Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is a measure of structural drift from a reference structure, not a measure of thermodynamic stability ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ or $T_m$). A lower RMSD in a short simulation does not necessarily correlate with a higher melting temperature.\n3.  **Qualitative, not quantitative**: This method provides no path to quantify $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ or to predict the $\\Delta T_m$ of $3\\,\\mathrm{K}$. It is a crude, qualitative, and physically unsound approach.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Use rigid-body docking to place chloride ions on the protein surface for the wild type and mutant, and select the model that binds fewer ions as the more stable one, arguing that reduced ion binding explains the higher $T_m$.**\nThis protocol is ad hoc and physically baseless.\n1.  The primary electrostatic interaction for the negatively charged Asp$35$ would be with cations ($\\text{Na}^+$), not anions ($\\text{Cl}^-$). The premise is questionable.\n2.  Simply counting bound ions is not a measure of thermodynamic stability. Ion binding contributes to the total free energy, but it cannot be isolated and used as a proxy for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$.\n3.  This method completely ignores the role of the solvent, the unfolded state, temperature, and the overall protein structure and dynamics. It does not compute any relevant thermodynamic quantity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Compute the change in solvent-accessible surface area upon mutation from a single native structure and estimate the stability change using a surface-tension model $\\Delta G \\approx \\gamma \\Delta A$, without simulating temperature dependence, protonation, or unfolded states.**\nThis protocol is a gross oversimplification.\n1.  The model $\\Delta G \\approx \\gamma \\Delta A$ primarily accounts for the hydrophobic effect. The D$35$N mutation is dominated by electrostatics (change of $-1e$ to $0$), which this model completely ignores.\n2.  Using a single static structure neglects the conformational flexibility of the protein, which is essential for calculating free energies.\n3.  The protocol fails to account for the mutation's effect in the unfolded state, a critical component of $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$.\n4.  It ignores all specified experimental conditions: temperature, $pH$, and ionic strength. It cannot provide a quantitative explanation for the observation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Perform Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) folding simulations in an implicit solvent model for both sequences across a temperature range and estimate $T_m$ as the temperature where the native population equals the unfolded population, keeping protonation states fixed at their standard values.**\nThis protocol is a valid, but suboptimal and less accurate, approach compared to A.\n1.  **REMD**: This method can, in principle, be used to compute the entire folding thermal denaturation curve and thus directly estimate $T_m$ for both WT and MUT. However, achieving convergence for even a small protein's folding is extremely computationally expensive.\n2.  **Implicit solvent**: This is a major limitation. Implicit solvent models are approximations and are generally less accurate than explicit solvent for describing specific ion effects and the detailed electrostatics of a charge-changing mutation.\n3.  **Fixed protonation states**: Fixing the protonation state of Asp to be deprotonated is an approximation. It is less rigorous than CpHMD (Option A), which allows the protonation equilibrium to be sampled dynamically in response to the local environment at the specified $pH$.\n4.  **Efficiency**: Calculating $\\Delta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ via an alchemical cycle (Option A) is typically far more computationally efficient than simulating the full folding process twice (once for WT, once for MUT) to the point of convergence, as required by this REMD protocol.\n\nWhile being a plausible strategy, this protocol is inferior to A due to its use of a less accurate physical model (implicit solvent, fixed charges) and its potential for being computationally less efficient for the specific task of quantifying the effect of a single mutation. Therefore, it is not the \"most appropriate\" choice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, Option A describes the most rigorous, physically accurate, and computationally appropriate strategy to address the question posed.",
