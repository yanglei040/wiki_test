This exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation of the interaction energy between a point charge and a polarizable particle.

            "problem": "A neutral, isotropic, and linearly polarizable particle with polarizability $\\alpha$ is placed at a distance $r$ from a fixed point charge $q$ in vacuum with permittivity $\\varepsilon_{0}$. The particle has no permanent dipole moment. The local electric field at the particle is assumed to be the field of the point charge alone, and the quasi-static limit applies. The induced dipole moment is defined by $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\alpha \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$, where $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$ is the local electric field at the particle.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and fundamental electrostatics, determine the induction (polarization) energy of interaction between the charge and the polarizable particle as a function of $q$, $\\alpha$, $r$, and $\\varepsilon_{0}$. Provide your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $q$, $\\alpha$, $r$, and $\\varepsilon_{0}$ only. Do not evaluate numerically and do not include units in your final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is critically evaluated and found to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in classical electrostatics, containing all necessary information and no contradictions. We may therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the induction energy of interaction between a fixed point charge $q$ and a neutral, linearly polarizable particle. The specified givens are the charge $q$, the particle's scalar polarizability $\\alpha$, the distance $r$ between them, and the vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_{0}$. The particle has no permanent dipole moment.\n\nThe foundation of this interaction is the electric field generated by the point charge $q$. According to Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ at a distance $r$ from the charge is given by:\n$$ E = \\frac{|q|}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r^2} $$\nThe problem states that this field from the point charge is to be considered the local field $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$ at the particle. Thus, $E_{\\text{loc}} = E$.\n\nThe particle is linearly polarizable, which is described by the relation $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\alpha \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ is the induced dipole moment. Since $\\alpha$ is a positive scalar constant, the induced dipole moment $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ is always aligned with the local electric field $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$.\n\nThe total potential energy of this system, which we identify as the induction energy $U_{ind}$, is not simply the energy of a dipole in a field, $U = -\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$. That formula applies to a permanent dipole. For an induced dipole, we must account for the energy required to create the dipole in the first place. The total induction energy is the sum of two terms: first, the work done on the particle to polarize it, $W_{pol}$, and second, the interaction energy of the resulting dipole with the field that created it, $U_{int}$.\n\nThe work done to polarize the particle against its internal restoring forces is stored as potential energy within the particle. This energy is calculated by integrating the work element $d W = E' d\\mu'$ from a state of no polarization to the final state:\n$$ W_{pol} = \\int_0^{\\mu} E' d\\mu' $$\nGiven the linear relationship $\\mu' = \\alpha E'$, we can write $d\\mu' = \\alpha dE'$. The integral is then performed with respect to the field strength:\n$$ W_{pol} = \\int_0^{E} E' (\\alpha dE') = \\alpha \\int_0^{E} E' dE' = \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha E^2 $$\nThis term represents the energy stored in the polarized particle.\n\nNext, the potential energy of the induced dipole $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ interacting with the external field $\\mathbf{E}$ is given by the standard formula:\n$$ U_{int} = -\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} $$\nSubstituting the definition of the induced dipole, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\alpha \\mathbf{E}$, we obtain:\n$$ U_{int} = -(\\alpha \\mathbf{E}) \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = -\\alpha E^2 $$\nThe total induction energy is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ U_{ind} = W_{pol} + U_{int} = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E^2 - \\alpha E^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E^2 $$\nThis result, $U_{ind} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E^2$, is a cornerstone of polarization phenomena. The factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ correctly distinguishes the energy of an induced dipole from that of a permanent one. An alternative derivation based on integrating the force $\\mathbf{F} = (\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{E}$ over distance from infinity yields the same potential energy expression, confirming its correctness.\n\nTo find the final expression, we substitute the square of the electric field magnitude, $E^2$, into our energy equation.\n$$ E^2 = \\left(\\frac{|q|}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{q^2}{(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0)^2 r^4} $$\nNote that the energy depends on $q^2$, so the interaction is attractive regardless of the sign of the charge $q$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $U_{ind}$, we arrive at the final analytical expression for the induction energy:\n$$ U_{ind} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\left( \\frac{q^2}{(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0)^2 r^4} \\right) = - \\frac{\\alpha q^2}{2(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0)^2 r^4} $$\nThis expression represents the complete solution as a function of the given parameters $q$, $\\alpha$, $r$, and $\\varepsilon_0$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of a system of coupled linear equations describing the mutual induction of two polarizable particles in a uniform external electric field. The primary task is to determine the conditions under which a unique, finite solution for the induced dipole moments exists and to calculate the magnitude of one of the dipole moments, $|\\mu_1|$, when such a solution is found. This phenomenon is a classic example of polarization response in computational chemistry, and the divergence of the solution corresponds to the polarization catastrophe.\n\nThe governing equations for the induced dipole moments, $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, are given as:\n$$\n\\mu_1 = \\alpha^{\\mathrm{SI}}_1 \\left( E_0 + \\frac{2 \\mu_2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^3} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_2 = \\alpha^{\\mathrm{SI}}_2 \\left( E_0 + \\frac{2 \\mu_1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^3} \\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha^{\\mathrm{SI}}_i$ is the polarizability in SI units, $E_0$ is the external field magnitude, $r$ is the interparticle distance, and $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nTo simplify this system, we use the provided relation between polarizability in SI units and polarizability in volume units, $\\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_i$:\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\mathrm{SI}}_i = 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\, \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_i\n$$\nSubstituting this into the coupled equations yields:\n$$\n\\mu_1 = 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_1 \\left( E_0 + \\frac{2 \\mu_2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^3} \\right) = 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_1 E_0 + \\frac{2 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_1}{r^3} \\mu_2\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_2 = 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_2 \\left( E_0 + \\frac{2 \\mu_1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^3} \\right) = 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_2 E_0 + \\frac{2 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_2}{r^3} \\mu_1\n$$\nThis simplification is valid as long as $\\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_i$ and $r^3$ are expressed in consistent units (e.g., $\\mathrm{m}^3$), making the ratio $\\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_i/r^3$ dimensionless.\n\nWe can rearrange these equations into a standard matrix form, $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{x} = [\\mu_1, \\mu_2]^T$:\n$$\n\\mu_1 - \\frac{2 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_1}{r^3} \\mu_2 = 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_1 E_0\n$$\n$$\n- \\frac{2 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_2}{r^3} \\mu_1 + \\mu_2 = 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_2 E_0\n$$\nThis corresponds to the matrix system:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & - \\frac{2 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_1}{r^3} \\\\\n- \\frac{2 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_2}{r^3} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mu_1 \\\\\n\\mu_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 E_0 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_1 \\\\\n4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 E_0 \\alpha^{\\mathrm{vol}}_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA unique, finite solution for $(\\mu_1, \\mu_2)$ exists if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is non-zero.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical electrostatics, mathematically well-posed, and provides a complete and unambiguous specification for the required computation. We therefore proceed directly to the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe system consists of a set of $N$ atomic sites, where each site $i$ is characterized by a position vector $\\mathbf{r}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, a static partial charge $q_i$, and an isotropic scalar polarizability $\\alpha_i \\ge 0$. The atoms are grouped into $M$ disjoint residues, specified by a mapping $R(i)$ from an atom index to a residue index.\n\nThe first step is to determine the electric field at each polarizable site $i$. According to the problem, this field, denoted $\\mathbf{E}_i^0$, is generated only by the permanent charges $q_j$ of all other atoms ($j \\neq i$). The contribution to the field at $\\mathbf{r}_i$ from a point charge $q_j$ at $\\mathbf{r}_j$ is given by Coulomb's Law. Using the specified reduced units where the electrostatic constant $k=1$, this is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}_{ij} = \\frac{q_j (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j)}{|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|^3}\n$$\nBy the principle of superposition, the total electric field at site $i$ due to the permanent charge distribution is the vector sum over all other sites:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}_i^0 = \\sum_{j=0, j \\neq i}^{N-1} \\mathbf{E}_{ij} = \\sum_{j=0, j \\neq i}^{N-1} \\frac{q_j (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j)}{|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|^3}\n$$\nThis field $\\mathbf{E}_i^0$ is the \"zeroth-order\" field, as it arises solely from the fixed, permanent charges.\n\nThe second step is to calculate the dipole moment $\\mathbf{p}_i$ induced at site $i$. For an isotropic site with polarizability $\\alpha_i$, the induced dipole is linearly proportional to the local electric field. The problem specifies a first-order approximation where mutual polarization is neglected. Thus, the inducing field is simply $\\mathbf{E}_i^0$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}_i = \\alpha_i \\mathbf{E}_i^0\n$$\nThis approximation is common and defines a non-self-consistent polarization model. If $\\alpha_i = 0$, then no dipole is induced, $\\mathbf{p}_i = \\mathbf{0}$, and the site makes no contribution to the polarization energy.\n\nThe third step is to compute the polarization energy. The potential energy $U_i$ of an induced dipole $\\mathbf{p}_i$ in the field $\\mathbf{E}_i^0$ that created it is given by:\n$$\nU_i = -\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{p}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_i^0\n$$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ arises because the energy stored is the work done to separate the charge within the polarizable entity, which grows linearly with the field. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{p}_i$, we obtain a direct formula for the polarization energy of site $i$:\n$$\nU_i = -\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha_i |\\mathbf{E}_i^0|^2\n$$\nSince $\\alpha_i \\ge 0$ and $|\\mathbf{E}_i^0|^2 \\ge 0$, the site polarization energy $U_i$ is always less than or equal to zero.\n\nThe fourth step is to aggregate these site-level energies by residue. The total polarization energy of a residue $k$, denoted $U_{R_k}$, is the scalar sum of the polarization energies of all atoms $i$ that belong to residue $k$. Let $S_k = \\{i \\mid R(i) = k\\}$ be the set of indices of atoms in residue $k$. Then:\n$$\nU_{R_k} = \\sum_{i \\in S_k} U_i = \\sum_{i \\in S_k} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha_i |\\mathbf{E}_i^0|^2\\right)\n$$\n\nThe final objective is to identify the residue with the largest magnitude of polarization energy, $|U_{R_k}|$. The computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For a given system of $N$ atoms and $M$ residues, initialize an array of residue energies, $E_{\\text{res}}$, of size $M$ to all zeros.\n2. For each atom $i$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    a. If the polarizability $\\alpha_i$ is zero, its energy contribution is zero. Proceed to the next atom.\n    b. Calculate the electric field vector $\\mathbf{E}_i^0 = \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{q_j (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j)}{|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|^3}$.\n    c. Calculate the squared magnitude of this field, $|\\mathbf{E}_i^0|^2 = \\mathbf{E}_i^0 \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_i^0$.\n    d. Compute the site polarization energy $U_i = -0.5 \\times \\alpha_i \\times |\\mathbf{E}_i^0|^2$.\n    e. Determine the residue index $k = R(i)$ for atom $i$.\n    f. Add the site energy to the total for its residue: $E_{\\text{res}}[k] = E_{\\text{res}}[k] + U_i$.\n3. After iterating through all atoms, the array $E_{\\text{res}}$ contains the total polarization energy for each residue.\n4. Calculate the absolute value of each element in $E_{\\text{res}}$ to get the energy magnitudes.\n5. Find the maximum magnitude, $U_{\\max} = \\max_k |E_{\\text{res}}[k]|$.\n6. Identify the set of residue indices $K_{\\text{max}} = \\{k \\mid |E_{\\text{res}}[k]| \\ge U_{\\max} - \\varepsilon\\}$, where $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$ is the specified tolerance for floating-point comparisons.\n7. The final answer is the smallest index in this set, $\\min(K_{\\text{max}})$. This resolves any ties by selecting the lowest residue index among those with the maximum energy magnitude.\nThis procedure is deterministic and provides a unique solution for any valid input.",
