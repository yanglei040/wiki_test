The concepts used—electron density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$, Hessian matrix $\\nabla\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r})$, eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$, and critical points—are all standard and well-defined within this theory. The problem describes a student's finding and asks for an explanation of the result, which is a valid form of scientific inquiry. The scenario of a student misinterpreting computational results is realistic. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, objective, and does not violate any fundamental principles. The core of the problem lies in comparing the observed properties of the point with the established definitions of different types of critical points in QTAIM.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution can be derived from the first principles of QTAIM.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nIn the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), the topology of the electron density scalar field, $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$, is analyzed. Points where the gradient of the electron density vanishes, $\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0}$, are known as critical points (CPs). For non-degenerate systems, which are typical for molecules, CPs are classified based on the rank and signature of the Hessian matrix, $\\nabla\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r})$, at the critical point. The rank is the number of non-zero eigenvalues, which is $3$ for all CPs in a molecule. The signature is the sum of the signs of the three eigenvalues, $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$.\n\nThe classification is as follows:\n- **(3, -3) Critical Point (Nuclear Critical Point, NCP):** The signature is $-3$. All three eigenvalues are negative ($\\lambda_1 < 0, \\lambda_2 < 0, \\lambda_3 < 0$). This corresponds to a local maximum in $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$. These CPs are found at the positions of the nuclei.\n- **(3, -1) Critical Point (Bond Critical Point, BCP):** The signature is $-1$. Two eigenvalues are negative and one is positive ($\\lambda_1 < 0, \\lambda_2 < 0, \\lambda_3 > 0$). This corresponds to a saddle point. The density is a maximum in the plane defined by the eigenvectors of the two negative eigenvalues, and a minimum along the direction of the eigenvector of the positive eigenvalue. This point lies on a bond path connecting two chemically bonded atoms.\n- **(3, +1) Critical Point (Ring Critical Point, RCP):** The signature is $+1$. One eigenvalue is negative and two are positive ($\\lambda_1 < 0, \\lambda_2 > 0, \\lambda_3 > 0$). This saddle point is found within a ring of bonded atoms.\n- **(3, +3) Critical Point (Cage Critical Point, CCP):** The signature is $+3$. All three eigenvalues are positive ($\\lambda_1 > 0, \\lambda_2 > 0, \\lambda_3 > 0$). This corresponds to a local minimum in $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ and is found inside a molecular cage.\n\nThe student has found a point where all three eigenvalues of the Hessian of $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ are negative. According to the rigorous QTAIM classification, such a point is a (3, -3) critical point, or a nuclear critical point (NCP). The student's labeling of this point as a bond critical point (BCP) is incorrect, as a BCP must, by definition, have a (3, -1) signature (two negative eigenvalues and one positive eigenvalue). The finding is therefore entirely inconsistent with the label assigned by the student, but perfectly consistent with the definition of a different type of critical point.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The point is actually a nuclear critical point misidentified as a bond critical point; a nuclear critical point has three negative eigenvalues for $\\nabla\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r})$.**\nThis explanation aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles. A point with three negative eigenvalues for the Hessian of $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ is, by definition, a nuclear critical point. The student's error is one of misidentification. The location \"on the line segment between two nuclei\" is where a nucleus itself is located.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The student analyzed the Hessian of the electrostatic potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ instead of $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$; at a bond critical point, the Hessian of $V(\\mathbf{r})$ must have three negative eigenvalues.**\nThis option proposes two things: an error in the quantity analyzed and a property of the Hessian of the electrostatic potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$. The statement that the Hessian of $V(\\mathbf{r})$ *must* have three negative eigenvalues at a BCP is not a standard principle of QTAIM and is generally false. For example, along the bond axis, the electrostatic potential often exhibits a minimum between the nuclei, which would correspond to a positive second derivative (eigenvalue), not a negative one. This option introduces a scientifically unsubstantiated premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The student reported the eigenvalues of $-\\nabla\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ rather than $\\nabla\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r})$, which flips the signs and makes a bond critical point appear to have three negative eigenvalues.**\nLet us test this hypothesis. A proper BCP has eigenvalues with signs (-, -, +). If the student analyzed the negative of the Hessian, $-\\nabla\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r})$, the eigenvalues would be the negative of the original eigenvalues. The signs would become (+, +, -). This corresponds to a (3, +1) signature, characteristic of a ring critical point, not the observed three negative eigenvalues. The explanation is mathematically inconsistent with the reported result.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The bond is a very strong shared-shell (covalent) interaction; therefore, all principal curvatures of $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ at a bond critical point are negative.**\nThis statement directly contradicts the definition of a bond critical point. A BCP is fundamentally a saddle point in the electron density, connecting the two atomic maxima (NCPs). It must have one positive curvature ($\\lambda_3 > 0$) along the bond path. The strength or nature of the chemical bond (covalent, ionic, etc.) is reflected in the magnitudes of the eigenvalues and other properties at the BCP, but it does not change the signature from (3, -1). A point with three negative curvatures is a local maximum, not a saddle point.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The point does not satisfy the critical point condition $\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0}$; away from critical points, three negative eigenvalues at a point on a bond path are expected and still indicate a bond critical point.**\nThis option is flawed. The definition of a \"bond critical point\" requires $\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0}$. If this condition is not met, the point is, by definition, *not* a critical point of any kind. While it is true that the Hessian can be evaluated at any point, to speak of \"indicating a bond critical point\" is a misuse of strict terminology. Furthermore, as one moves along a bond path from a BCP towards an NCP, the eigenvalues of the Hessian change. Close to the NCP, they will all be negative. However, this does not mean the point \"indicates a BCP\"; it simply indicates proximity to an NCP. This option conflates and relaxes the strict definitions that form the foundation of QTAIM analysis. Option A provides a much cleaner and more accurate explanation based on these definitions, assuming the student correctly located a point where $\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx \\mathbf{0}$ but misinterpreted its identity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe problem provides the following topological descriptors for a bond critical point (BCP) in a diatomic interaction:\n- Electron density: $ \\rho_{bcp} = 0.25 $ (atomic units)\n- Laplacian of electron density: $ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} = -0.30 $ (atomic units)\n- Ellipticity: $ \\epsilon = 0.80 $\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is based on the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), a well-established and scientifically grounded theory in computational chemistry. The variables provided ($ \\rho_{bcp} $, $ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} $, $ \\epsilon $) are standard descriptors used in this theory. The values are within physically plausible, albeit specific, ranges for chemical bonds. The question is well-posed, asking for a classification based on these data, which is a standard application of QTAIM analysis. The problem is objective and contains sufficient information for a unique classification among the given choices.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe characterization of the chemical bond is based on the interpretation of the provided QTAIM descriptors.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Laplacian of the Electron Density ($ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} $)**\n    The sign of the Laplacian at the BCP, $ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} $, distinguishes between shared-shell and closed-shell interactions.\n    -   A negative Laplacian ($ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} < 0 $) indicates a local concentration of electron density, which is the defining characteristic of a **shared-shell interaction**, i.e., a covalent bond.\n    -   A positive Laplacian ($ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} > 0 $) indicates local depletion of electron density, characteristic of a **closed-shell interaction** (e.g., ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces).\n    In this problem, $ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} = -0.30 $, which is negative. This unequivocally classifies the interaction as shared-shell or covalent.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Electron Density ($ \\rho_{bcp} $)**\n    The magnitude of the electron density at the BCP, $ \\rho_{bcp} $, correlates with the bond strength and bond order. The value $ \\rho_{bcp} = 0.25 $ in atomic units is substantial. It is far too large for weak closed-shell interactions like van der Waals contacts (which typically have $ \\rho_{bcp} < 0.01 $ a.u.) or typical hydrogen bonds ($ \\rho_{bcp} \\approx 0.002-0.04 $ a.u.). It is also significantly larger than what is typically found for highly ionic bonds (e.g., in crystalline $\\text{NaCl}$, $ \\rho_{bcp} \\approx 0.05 $ a.u.). This value is highly characteristic of covalent bonds, for example, a carbon-carbon single bond in ethane has $ \\rho_{bcp} \\approx 0.24 $ a.u.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Ellipticity ($ \\epsilon $)**\n    The ellipticity, $ \\epsilon = (\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_2) - 1 $, quantifies the deviation of the electron density from cylindrical symmetry around the bond axis. Here, $ \\lambda_1 $ and $ \\lambda_2 $ are the two negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of $ \\rho $ at the BCP, with $ |\\lambda_1| \\ge |\\lambda_2| $.\n    -   An ellipticity of $ \\epsilon = 0 $ implies cylindrical symmetry of the charge distribution. This is expected for single $ \\sigma $ bonds and for linear triple bonds.\n    -   A non-zero ellipticity ($ \\epsilon > 0 $) indicates anisotropy in the charge distribution perpendicular to the bond axis. This is a robust indicator of $ \\pi $-character, as seen in double bonds, where electron density is preferentially accumulated in the plane of the $ \\pi $-bond.\n    The given value is $ \\epsilon = 0.80 $. This is a very large ellipticity, which provides definitive evidence of significant $ \\pi $-character and a pronounced deviation from cylindrical symmetry.\n\n**Synthesis of Analysis**\nThe combination of a negative Laplacian ($ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} < 0 $), a moderate-to-high electron density ($ \\rho_{bcp} = 0.25 $ a.u.), and a very high ellipticity ($ \\epsilon = 0.80 $) points to a **shared-shell (covalent) bond with substantial $ \\pi $-character**.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option based on this conclusion.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. A closed-shell ionic or hydrogen-bond interaction with charge depletion at the BCP; example: $\\text{Na}^+ \\cdots \\text{Cl}^-$ in crystalline $\\text{NaCl}$.**\nThis option describes a closed-shell interaction. Such interactions are characterized by $ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} > 0 $ (charge depletion). The provided data is $ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} = -0.30 $, indicating charge concentration. This directly contradicts the premise of the option.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. A shared-shell single $ \\sigma $ bond; example: a $\\text{C-C}$ single bond in ethane.**\nThis is a shared-shell interaction, which is consistent with $ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} < 0 $. The value of $ \\rho_{bcp} = 0.25 $ a.u. is also close to that of a $\\text{C-C}$ bond. However, a single $ \\sigma $ bond is, to a good approximation, cylindrically symmetric. It should therefore have an ellipticity close to zero ($ \\epsilon \\approx 0 $). The given ellipticity of $ \\epsilon = 0.80 $ is extremely high and incompatible with the description of a simple $ \\sigma $ bond.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A shared-shell multiple bond with significant $ \\pi $-character (approximately a double bond); example: a $\\text{C=C}$ bond in ethene.**\nThis option proposes a shared-shell bond ($ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} < 0 $) with significant $ \\pi $-character ($ \\epsilon > 0 $). This is perfectly consistent with the derived characteristics. A double bond consists of a $ \\sigma $ bond and a $ \\pi $ bond, leading to a non-cylindrical electron distribution and hence a positive ellipticity. While the value $ \\epsilon = 0.80 $ is higher than the typical value for ethene (around $0.3-0.4$), and the density $ \\rho_{bcp} = 0.25 $ a.u. is lower than ethene's (around $0.34$ a.u.), these values are still characteristic of a covalent bond with very strong $ \\pi $-character. Of all provided choices, this classification is by far the most plausible. The descriptors point to a bond that is covalent and highly non-cylindrical.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. A weak van der Waals contact; example: $\\text{Ne} \\cdots \\text{Ne}$ in a noble-gas dimer.**\nThis is a closed-shell interaction characterized by a very low electron density ($ \\rho_{bcp} \\ll 0.1 $ a.u.) and a positive Laplacian ($ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} > 0 $). The provided data ($ \\rho_{bcp} = 0.25 $ a.u., $ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} = -0.30 $ a.u.) are in complete opposition to the properties of a van der Waals contact.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A linear triple bond; example: a $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ bond in acetylene.**\nA triple bond is a shared-shell interaction ($ \\nabla^2 \\rho_{bcp} < 0 $) and has a high electron density (typically $ \\rho_{bcp} > 0.4 $ a.u. for $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$). The critical failure of this option is the ellipticity. A linear triple bond, composed of one $ \\sigma $ and two orthogonal $ \\pi $ bonds, is cylindrically symmetric. Therefore, its ellipticity must be $ \\epsilon = 0 $. The given value of $ \\epsilon = 0.80 $ is a direct contradiction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, the only option consistent with all three topological descriptors is C. The bond is covalent (negative Laplacian) and possesses substantial $ \\pi $-character (high ellipticity).",

It is a valid problem within the domain of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). The provided data, definitions, and the topological sum rule are standard and correct for an isolated, finite molecule with no non-nuclear attractors. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe central question is whether a stable molecule can exist such that the number of bond critical points, $n_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is greater than the number of nuclear critical points (atoms), $n_{\\mathrm{n}}$. That is, can the inequality $n_{\\mathrm{b}} > n_{\\mathrm{n}}$ be satisfied?\n\nThe analysis must begin with the provided topological sum rule, which governs the relationship between the numbers of different types of critical points in the electron density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}} + n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1$$\nHere, $n_{\\mathrm{n}}$, $n_{\\mathrm{b}}$, $n_{\\mathrm{r}}$, and $n_{\\mathrm{c}}$ are non-negative integers representing the number of nuclear, bond, ring, and cage critical points, respectively.\n\nTo investigate the condition $n_{\\mathrm{b}} > n_{\\mathrm{n}}$, it is useful to rearrange the sum rule to express the difference between $n_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{n}}$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}} = 1 - n_{\\mathrm{r}} + n_{\\mathrm{c}}$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ gives the difference $n_{\\mathrm{b}} - n_{\\mathrm{n}}$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{b}} - n_{\\mathrm{n}} = n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} - 1$$\nThe condition $n_{\\mathrm{b}} > n_{\\mathrm{n}}$ is equivalent to the condition that the difference $n_{\\mathrm{b}} - n_{\\mathrm{n}}$ is a positive integer. Using the rearranged formula, this requires:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} - 1 > 0$$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} > 1$$\nThus, a molecule can have more bond critical points than nuclear critical points if and only if the number of its ring critical points exceeds the number of its cage critical points by more than $1$.\n\nThis is a purely mathematical condition on the integer counts of topological features. We must now consider if this condition can be met by real, stable molecules.\n- For a simple acyclic molecule (e.g., methane, $\\text{CH}_4$), there are no rings and no cages, so $n_{\\mathrm{r}} = 0$ and $n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 0$. In this case, $n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 0$, which is not greater than $1$. The sum rule becomes $n_{\\mathrm{b}} - n_{\\mathrm{n}} = 0 - 0 - 1 = -1$, meaning $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = n_{\\mathrm{n}} - 1$.\n- For a simple monocyclic molecule with no cages (e.g., benzene, $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6$), there is one ring critical point, so $n_{\\mathrm{r}} = 1$ and $n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 0$. In this case, $n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1$, which is not greater than $1$. The sum rule becomes $n_{\\mathrm{b}} - n_{\\mathrm{n}} = 1 - 0 - 1 = 0$, meaning $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = n_{\\mathrm{n}}$.\n- To satisfy $n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} > 1$, a molecule must possess a more complex topology. For example, consider a polycyclic molecule with at least two rings and no cages. A common example is naphthalene, $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_8$. QTAIM analysis shows it has $n_{\\mathrm{n}} = 18$ nuclei, $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = 19$ bond paths, $n_{\\mathrm{r}} = 2$ ring critical points, and $n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 0$ cage critical points.\nFor naphthalene:\n$n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 2 - 0 = 2$. Since $2 > 1$, the condition is met.\nIndeed, we find $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = 19$ and $n_{\\mathrm{n}} = 18$, so $n_{\\mathrm{b}} > n_{\\mathrm{n}}$.\nLet us verify the sum rule for naphthalene: $n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}} + n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 18 - 19 + 2 - 0 = 1$. The rule holds.\n\nAnother example is the tetrahedral white phosphorus molecule, $\\text{P}_4$. It has $n_{\\mathrm{n}} = 4$ nuclei, $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = 6$ bond paths (one along each edge of the tetrahedron), $n_{\\mathrm{r}} = 4$ ring critical points (one for each triangular face), and $n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1$ cage critical point in the center of the tetrahedron.\nFor $\\text{P}_4$:\n$n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 4 - 1 = 3$. Since $3 > 1$, the condition is met.\nIndeed, we find $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = 6$ and $n_{\\mathrm{n}} = 4$, so $n_{\\mathrm{b}} > n_{\\mathrm{n}}$.\nLet us verify the sum rule for $\\text{P}_4$: $n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}} + n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 4 - 6 + 4 - 1 = 1$. The rule holds.\n\nThe answer to the question is unequivocally \"Yes\". Stable molecules can and do exist with more bond critical points than atoms. Now, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. No. For any finite, isolated molecule the sum rule $n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}} + n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1$ forces $n_{\\mathrm{b}} \\le n_{\\mathrm{n}}$; otherwise the left-hand side would be negative.\nThis statement is incorrect. The reasoning is flawed. If $n_{\\mathrm{b}} > n_{\\mathrm{n}}$, the term $n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}}$ is indeed negative. However, the term $+ n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}}$ can be positive and sufficiently large to make the entire left-hand side equal to $1$. As shown in the derivation, this occurs when $n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} > 1$. The option falsely assumes that the contribution from rings and cages cannot compensate for the negative value of $n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. Yes. It is possible whenever the number of ring critical points exceeds the number of cage critical points by more than $1$, i.e., when $n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} > 1$; for example, molecules with at least $2$ independent rings and no cages satisfy $n_{\\mathrm{b}} > n_{\\mathrm{n}}$.\nThis statement is correct. It correctly answers \"Yes\" and provides the precise mathematical condition, $n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} > 1$, that follows directly from the sum rule. The example of molecules with at least $2$ independent rings and no cages ($n_{\\mathrm{r}} \\ge 2$, $n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 0$) is a valid class of systems satisfying this condition. My analysis of naphthalene confirms this. The connection between $n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and the number of independent rings (cyclomatic number) in the molecular graph is also correct, further strengthening the argument.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. Yes, but only in periodic crystals; for finite molecules the Euler characteristic is $0$, so $n_{\\mathrm{b}}$ cannot exceed $n_{\\mathrm{n}}$.\nThis statement is incorrect and contradictory. It begins by saying \"Yes\" but concludes that for finite molecules (the subject of the question) it is not possible. Furthermore, its reasoning contains factual errors. The topological sum rule for a finite, isolated molecule is $n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}} + n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1$, which means the relevant Euler characteristic is not $0$. For a periodic crystal, the topology is that of a 3-torus, for which the Euler characteristic is indeed $0$, leading to a different sum rule ($n_{\\mathrm{n}} - n_{\\mathrm{b}} + n_{\\mathrm{r}} - n_{\\mathrm{c}} = 0$). The problem, however, is explicitly about finite molecules.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. No. Each bond critical point is uniquely associated with a pair of nuclei, so $n_{\\mathrm{b}} \\le n_{\\mathrm{n}}/2$ for any stable molecule.\nThis statement is incorrect. The conclusion $n_{\\mathrm{b}} \\le n_{\\mathrm{n}}/2$ (or $2n_{\\mathrm{b}} \\le n_{\\mathrm{n}}$) is based on a flawed combinatorial argument. While a bond critical point lies on a path between two nuclei, an individual nucleus can, and usually does, participate in multiple bonds. A simple counterexample is methane, $\\text{CH}_4$, where $n_{\\mathrm{n}} = 5$ and $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = 4$. The inequality would require $4 \\le 5/2 = 2.5$, which is false. The molecule $\\text{P}_4$ is a counterexample to both this inequality and the main claim of the option, as it has $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = 6$ and $n_{\\mathrm{n}} = 4$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
