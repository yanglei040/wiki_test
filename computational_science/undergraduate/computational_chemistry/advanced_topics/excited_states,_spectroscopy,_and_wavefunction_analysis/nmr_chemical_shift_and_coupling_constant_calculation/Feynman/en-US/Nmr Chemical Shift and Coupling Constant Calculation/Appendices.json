However, NMR spectra are typically displayed on a chemical shift scale ($\\delta$) in parts per million ($ \\mathrm{ppm} $), which is field-dependent. This fundamental exercise bridges this gap, providing essential practice in converting between the absolute frequency domain of $J$ and the relative ppm scale used in spectral analysis . Mastering this conversion is a crucial first step for accurately interpreting and comparing spectra recorded on different NMR spectrometers.",

The separation between the peaks within a given multiplet is constant and is known as the coupling constant, $J$. This value is independent of the external magnetic field strength. Consider a sample analyzed in a high-field NMR spectrometer operating at a proton resonance frequency of $400$ MHz. A specific proton signal in the resulting spectrum is observed as a triplet.

The electronic structure is modeled by the Hückel Hamiltonian on a set of localized atomic orbitals, with one electron per site and a closed-shell ground state. Let the number of sites be $N$, and let the adjacency matrix be $A \\in \\{0,1\\}^{N \\times N}$ with $A_{ij} = 1$ if sites $i$ and $j$ are bonded and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed computational exercise in quantum chemistry. It asks for the calculation of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-spin coupling constant, $J_{XY}$, based on a simplified model derived from Hückel Molecular Orbital (HMO) theory and second-order perturbation theory. All parameters and definitions required for the calculation are provided, and the problem is scientifically grounded within the context of this model.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, we construct the Hückel Hamiltonian matrix, $H$, for an $N$-site system. Given the adjacency matrix $A$ and the parameters $\\alpha=0$ and $\\beta=-1$, the Hamiltonian is defined element-wise as\n$$\nH_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n0, & i=j,\\\\\n-1, & A_{ij}=1,\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the matrix expression $H = \\beta A = -A$, since $A$ has zeros on its diagonal.\n\nSecond, we solve the secular equation, which is the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian matrix:\n$$\nH \\mathbf{c}^{(k)} = \\varepsilon_k \\mathbf{c}^{(k)}\n$$\nSolving this for the symmetric matrix $H$ yields a set of $N$ real eigenvalues $\\{\\varepsilon_k\\}_{k=1}^N$, which represent the molecular orbital energies, and a corresponding set of $N$ orthonormal eigenvectors $\\{\\mathbf{c}^{(k)}\\}_{k=1}^N$. The eigenvectors form the columns of a matrix $C$, where $C_{ik} = c_{ik}$ is the coefficient of the $i$-th atomic orbital in the $k$-th molecular orbital. The eigenvalues are sorted in ascending order, $\\varepsilon_1 \\le \\varepsilon_2 \\le \\cdots \\le \\varepsilon_N$, and the eigenvectors are ordered accordingly.\n\nThird, for a neutral system with one $\\pi$-electron per site, the $N$ electrons occupy the molecular orbitals in accordance with the Aufbau principle. For a closed-shell electronic ground state, the $N/2$ orbitals with the lowest energies are doubly occupied. Thus, orbitals indexed by $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N/2\\}$ are the occupied molecular orbitals (OMOs), and orbitals indexed by $r \\in \\{N/2+1, \\dots, N\\}$ are the virtual (unoccupied) molecular orbitals (VMOs).\n\nFourth, we compute the spin-spin coupling constant $J_{XY}$ between sites $X$ and $Y$ using the provided sum-over-states formula, which is a second-order perturbation theory expression:\n$$\nJ_{XY} = K \\sum_{a=1}^{N/2} \\sum_{r=N/2+1}^{N} T_{ar}\n$$\nwhere $K$ is a given scaling constant ($K = 1000$ Hz) and $T_{ar}$ is the contribution from the electronic excitation from occupied orbital $a$ to virtual orbital $r$:\n$$\nT_{ar} = \\frac{c_{Xa} \\, c_{Xr} \\, c_{Yr} \\, c_{Ya}}{\\varepsilon_r - \\varepsilon_a}\n$$\nThe coefficients $c_{Pi}$ correspond to the elements of the eigenvector matrix $C$. Specifically, for site $P$ (1-based index) and orbital $i$ (1-based index), the coefficient is $C_{P-1, i-1}$ in 0-based matrix notation. This summation is performed over all pairs of occupied and virtual orbitals.\n\nFinally, during the summation, we track the individual terms $T_{ar}$ to identify the dominant orbital-mediation pathway. This is the pair of indices $(a^\\star, r^\\star)$ for which the absolute value of the contribution, $|T_{ar}|$, is maximal.\n\nFor each test case, we apply this procedure to the specified adjacency matrix $A$ and sites $X$ and $Y$. The final computed value of $J_{XY}$ is rounded to six decimal places, and the result is reported as a list $[J_{XY}, a^\\star, r^\\star]$. If there is degeneracy in the molecular orbital energies, the eigenvectors for the degenerate subspace are not unique but form an orthonormal basis. The total coupling constant $J_{XY}$ is invariant to the specific choice of this basis. However, the individual contributions $T_{ar}$ and thus the dominant pathway $(a^\\star, r^\\star)$ may depend on the basis chosen by the numerical eigensolver. The procedure is to use the basis provided by the specified numerical library (`numpy.linalg.eigh`) and report the resulting dominant pathway.",
