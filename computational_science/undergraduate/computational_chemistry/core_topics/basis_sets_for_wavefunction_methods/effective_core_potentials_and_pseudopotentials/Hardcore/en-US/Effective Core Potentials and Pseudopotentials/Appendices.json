It constitutes a valid exercise in demonstrating a fundamental limitation of effective core potential (ECP) methods in computational chemistry.

We begin by deriving the expressions for the two observables.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the all-electron (AE) smeared contact observable, $\\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{AE}}(Z,r_s)$. This requires the calculation of the integral of the radial probability density, $4\\pi r^2 \\rho_{\\mathrm{AE}}(r;Z)$, within a sphere of radius $r_s$.

The ECP model sets the density to zero for $r \\le r_c$. The integral is therefore taken from a lower bound of $r_c$.\n$$\n\\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{ECP}}(Z,r_c,r_s) = \\frac{3}{r_s^3} \\int_{r_c}^{r_s} \\rho_{\\mathrm{AE}}(r;Z)\\, r^2 \\, dr\n$$\nThis applies for the case $0 \\le r_c < r_s$. If $r_c \\ge r_s$, the integration interval is empty or of zero length, and the integral is strictly zero. For $r_c < r_s$, we use the same indefinite integral as before, but with new limits:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{ECP}} = \\int_{r_c}^{r_s} \\rho_{\\mathrm{AE}}(r;Z)\\, r^2 \\, dr = \\frac{Z^3}{\\pi} \\left[ -\\frac{e^{-2Zr}}{4Z^3} \\left( 2Z^2r^2 + 2Zr + 1 \\right) \\right]_{r_c}^{r_s}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{ECP}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left[ -e^{-2Zr} \\left( 2Z^2r^2 + 2Zr + 1 \\right) \\right]_{r_c}^{r_s}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{ECP}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left( e^{-2Zr_c}(2Z^2r_c^2 + 2Zr_c + 1) - e^{-2Zr_s}(2Z^2r_s^2 + 2Zr_s + 1) \\right)\n$$\nThe ratio $R(Z,r_c,r_s)$ is $\\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{ECP}} / \\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{AE}} = I_{\\mathrm{ECP}} / I_{\\mathrm{AE}}$, since the prefactor $\\frac{3}{r_s^3}$ cancels completely.\n$$\nR(Z,r_c,r_s) = \\frac{e^{-2Zr_c}(2Z^2r_c^2 + 2Zr_c + 1) - e^{-2Zr_s}(2Z^2r_s^2 + 2Zr_s + 1)}{1 - e^{-2Zr_s}(2Z^2r_s^2 + 2Zr_s + 1)} \\quad \\text{for } r_c < r_s\n$$\nFor the case where $r_c \\ge r_s$, we have $\\overline{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{ECP}} = 0$, which means $R(Z,r_c,r_s) = 0$.\nA special trivial case is $r_c = 0$. Here, the numerator becomes $e^0(0+0+1) - e^{-2Zr_s}(...)$, which is identical to the denominator, yielding $R(Z,0,r_s)=1$. This is correct, as an ECP with a core radius of zero is equivalent to the all-electron calculation.\n\nThis closed-form expression for $R(Z,r_c,r_s)$ is implemented to evaluate the specified test cases.\n\nThe physical interpretation demonstrates the failure of this naive ECP approach. Effective Core Potentials are constructed to reproduce valence properties, such as orbital energies and the spatial distribution of the electron density far from the nucleus. They achieve this by replacing the strong Coulombic potential and the complex effects of the core electrons with a weaker pseudopotential. This procedure yields nodeless valence pseudo-wavefunctions that are computationally convenient but physically incorrect in the core region ($r < r_c$).\n\nProperties such as the Fermi contact interaction, electric field gradients at the nucleus, and Mössbauer isomer shifts depend critically on the electron density and its gradient at or very near the nucleus ($r \\to 0$). The ECP model, by its very design, removes the core electrons and sets the electron density to zero in this critical region. As shown in our calculation for the case $(Z, r_c, r_s) = (1, 0.2, 0.2)$, if the sampling radius $r_s$ is smaller than or equal to the core radius $r_c$, the ECP-based observable is exactly zero. This is a catastrophic failure, producing an infinite relative error compared to the non-zero all-electron result.\n\nEven when $r_c < r_s$, the ECP result is highly sensitive to the artificial parameter $r_c$. For a heavier atom with larger $Z$ (e.g., $Z=10$), the core density is much more concentrated near the nucleus. Removing this density even for a small $r_c$ (e.g., $0.05$ a.u.) leads to a grossly incorrect result, as seen in the test case $(10, 0.05, 0.2)$ which yields an error over $10\\%$. The value of $r_c$ is a parameter of computational convenience, not a physical observable. Any computed property that depends strongly on $r_c$ is, by definition, an unphysical artifact. The conclusion is inescapable: ECPs are fundamentally unsuitable for computing properties that depend on the electron density inside the core region. Attempting to do so is a misuse of the method and leads to nonsensical, arbitrary results.",
