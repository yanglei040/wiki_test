            "problem": "You are designing a minimal contracted Gaussian basis for a carbon atom to be used in a single-determinant molecular calculation. A contracted Gaussian basis function is defined as a fixed-coefficient linear combination of Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) primitives.

You wish to build one contracted $s$-type function intended to describe the carbon core orbital (the $1\\mathrm{s}$ shell) and one contracted function to describe the valence space (the $2\\mathrm{s}$ and $2\\mathrm{p}$ shells, ignoring angular dependence here and focusing on radial extent). You are given two candidate pools of exponents for $s$-type primitives:\n- Set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{1000, 100, 10, 1\\}$,\n- Set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{4, 3, 2, 1\\}$.\nEach contracted function must be formed exclusively from primitives chosen within a single set (that is, the core contraction must draw only from one of $\\mathcal{A}$ or $\\mathcal{B}$, and the valence contraction must draw only from the other set).

            "solution": "The problem statement is to be validated before any solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n- **System:** A carbon atom.\n- **Objective:** Design a minimal contracted Gaussian basis set for its core ($1\\mathrm{s}$) and valence shells.\n- **Contracted Function Definition:** A fixed-coefficient linear combination of Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) primitives.\n- **Primitive GTO Form:** An $s$-type primitive is given by $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = N \\exp(-\\alpha r^{2})$, where $\\alpha$ is the exponent.\n- **Primitive Exponent Sets:**\n    - Set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{1000, 100, 10, 1\\}$\n    - Set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{4, 3, 2, 1\\}$\n- **Constraint:** One set is to be used exclusively for the core-contracted function, and the other set is to be used exclusively for the valence-contracted function.\n- **Question:** Determine the most appropriate assignment of Set $\\mathcal{A}$ and Set $\\mathcal{B}$ to the core and valence functions, based on the relationship between the exponent $\\alpha$ and the spatial extent of the GTO.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The representation of atomic orbitals using contracted Gaussian functions is a cornerstone of modern computational chemistry. The mathematical form of the $s$-type GTO, $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = N \\exp(-\\alpha r^{2})$, is correct. The distinction between core and valence electrons and their respective spatial distributions is a fundamental concept in atomic physics. The question relies on the well-established principle that the exponent $\\alpha$ determines the radial extent of the Gaussian function.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct sets of exponents and two distinct orbital shells (core and valence) to be described. The constraints are clear and non-contradictory. A unique, logical conclusion can be derived based on the provided information and first principles.\n\nThe problem is objective. It requests an assignment based on established physical principles, not on subjective preference. The terminology used (\"core\", \"valence\", \"spatial extent\", \"exponent\") is standard and unambiguous in this context.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is deemed valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound problem in theoretical chemistry. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires us to assign two sets of Gaussian exponents, $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$, to describe the core and valence orbitals of a carbon atom. The decision must be based on the role of the exponent $\\alpha$ in the Gaussian function $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the function $\\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$. This is a Gaussian function centered at the origin ($r=0$). The exponent $\\alpha$ controls the width of the Gaussian distribution.\n- If $\\alpha$ is a large positive number, the term $-\\alpha r^2$ becomes very large and negative even for small values of $r$. Consequently, the function $\\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$ decays very rapidly as the distance $r$ from the nucleus increases. Such a function is spatially contracted, or \"tight,\" and represents high electron probability density very close to the nucleus.\n- Conversely, if $\\alpha$ is a small positive number, the function decays slowly with increasing $r$. This describes a spatially extended, or \"diffuse,\" distribution of electron density, significant at larger distances from the nucleus.\n\nNext, we must consider the physical properties of the orbitals we wish to model.\n- **Core orbitals**, such as the $1\\mathrm{s}$ orbital of carbon, are located very close to the nucleus. The electrons in these orbitals are strongly bound by the nuclear charge. The radial distribution function for a $1\\mathrm{s}$ orbital peaks very near the nucleus and decays exponentially. To accurately model this behavior, especially the high amplitude near $r=0$ (and to approximate the cusp of the true Slater-type orbital), a basis function must be constructed from very tight primitives. This requires GTOs with large exponents.\n- **Valence orbitals**, such as the $2\\mathrm{s}$ and $2\\mathrm{p}$ orbitals of carbon, are located further from the nucleus than the core orbitals. These electrons are responsible for chemical bonding. Their radial distributions are more diffuse and extend into the regions between atoms. To model these orbitals, basis functions constructed from more diffuse primitives are required. This necessitates GTOs with smaller exponents.\n\nNow, we compare the given sets of exponents:\n- Set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{1000, 100, 10, 1\\}$ contains very large values (e.g., $1000$, $100$). These exponents will generate extremely tight Gaussian functions, suitable for describing the electron density near the nucleus, characteristic of a core orbital. The wide range of exponents in this set allows for a flexible description of the core orbital shape.\n- Set $\\mathcal{B} = \\{4, 3, 2, 1\\}$ contains only small to moderate exponents. These will generate more diffuse Gaussian functions, appropriate for describing the spatially extended nature of valence orbitals.\n\nBased on this analysis, the logical and scientifically correct assignment is as follows:\n- The set with large exponents, Set $\\mathcal{A}$, must be used to construct the contracted function for the **core** ($1\\mathrm{s}$) orbital.\n- The set with smaller exponents, Set $\\mathcal{B}$, must be used to construct the contracted function for the **valence** shell.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Use $\\mathcal{A}$ for the core-contracted function and $\\mathcal{B}$ for the valence-contracted function, because larger $\\alpha$ values produce tighter primitives suitable for core and smaller $\\alpha$ values produce more diffuse primitives suitable for valence.**\nThis statement is a direct consequence of our derivation. It correctly associates large exponents ($\\alpha$) with tight functions for the core and small exponents with diffuse functions for the valence. The assignment of $\\mathcal{A}$ to core and $\\mathcal{B}$ to valence is therefore correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Use $\\mathcal{B}$ for the core-contracted function and $\\mathcal{A}$ for the valence-contracted function, because smaller $\\alpha$ values produce tighter primitives suitable for core and larger $\\alpha$ values produce more diffuse primitives suitable for valence.**\nThis option makes two fundamental errors. First, it incorrectly claims that smaller $\\alpha$ values produce tighter primitives and larger $\\alpha$ values produce more diffuse primitives. This is the opposite of the mathematical reality of the Gaussian function. Second, as a result of this flawed premise, it makes the incorrect assignment of Set $\\mathcal{B}$ to the core and Set $\\mathcal{A}$ to the valence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Either set can be used for either purpose with no preference; after contraction, coefficients can arbitrarily control spatial extent regardless of the exponents present.**\nThis statement is profoundly incorrect. A contracted basis function is a linear combination of primitives, $\\Psi = \\sum_i c_i \\phi_i$. The coefficients $c_i$ determine the weight of each primitive, but the spatial regions covered by the overall function $\\Psi$ are fundamentally limited by the spatial extent of the underlying primitives $\\phi_i$. One cannot create a highly diffuse function from a linear combination of only very tight primitives, nor can one accurately model the electron density cusp at the nucleus using only diffuse primitives. The choice of exponents is the most critical factor in determining the quality of a basis set.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use $\\mathcal{B}$ for both core and valence, because core and valence orbitals are both outside the nucleus and thus require only diffuse primitives, while very large exponents in $\\mathcal{A}$ are unnecessary for carbon.**\nThis option is invalid for two reasons. First, it violates the problem's explicit constraint that the core contraction must draw from one set and the valence from the other. Second, its physical reasoning is flawed. While it is true that core electrons have a non-zero probability outside the nucleus, the defining characteristic of a core orbital is its extremely high density *at* and *near* the nucleus. Modeling this requires very tight functions with large exponents, precisely like those in Set $\\mathcal{A}$. To claim that only diffuse primitives are needed is to ignore the fundamental nature of core orbitals.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Nuclear attraction integral:\n$$\nV'_{ij} = \\langle g_i | -\\frac{Z}{r} | g_j \\rangle = -Z \\int \\frac{1}{r} \\exp(-(\\alpha_i + \\alpha_j) r^2) d\\mathbf{r} = -Z \\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha_i + \\alpha_j}\n$$\nThe unnormalized Hamiltonian matrix is $H' = T' + V'$.\n\nThe solution procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For each set of exponents $\\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3\\}$ and charge $Z=3$:\n$2$. Construct the $3 \\times 3$ symmetric matrices $S'$ and $H' = T' + V'$ using the formulas above.\n$3$. Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem $H' \\mathbf{d} = E S' \\mathbf{d}$ using a numerical linear algebra library. This yields a set of eigenvalues (energies) and corresponding eigenvectors.\n$4$. The lowest eigenvalue is the desired energy, $E_{min}$. The corresponding eigenvector is $\\mathbf{d} = (d_1, d_2, d_3)^\\top$. Numerical solvers typically provide eigenvectors normalized such that $\\mathbf{d}^\\top S' \\mathbf{d} = 1$.\n$5$. Calculate the normalization constants $N_i = (2\\alpha_i/\\pi)^{3/4}$ for each primitive.\n$6$. Convert the coefficients $\\mathbf{d}$ for the unnormalized basis to the coefficients $\\mathbf{c}$ for the normalized basis using $c_i = d_i / N_i$. This automatically satisfies the normalization condition $\\mathbf{c}^\\top S \\mathbf{c} = 1$.\n$7$. Apply the specified sign convention: if the first coefficient $c_1$ is negative, multiply the entire vector $\\mathbf{c}$ by $-1$. This does not change the energy or the physical state.\n$8$. Collect the minimal energy $E_{min}$ and the final coefficients $c_1, c_2, c_3$. Report these values rounded to eight decimal places.",
