A solution will be derived.\n\nA continuous-time signal $x(t) = \\sin(2\\pi f t + \\phi)$ when sampled at a frequency $f_s$ results in the discrete-time sequence $x[n] = x(t_n) = \\sin(2\\pi f \\frac{n}{f_s} + \\phi)$.\n\nTwo distinct continuous-time sinusoids, $x_1(t) = \\sin(2\\pi f_1 t + \\phi_1)$ and $x_2(t) = \\sin(2\\pi f_2 t + \\phi_2)$, will produce identical sample sequences, i.e., $x_1[n] = x_2[n]$ for all integers $n$, if their respective arguments in the discrete domain are appropriately related.

This occurs if the frequencies are related by $f_1 = f_2 + k f_s$ for some non-zero integer $k$. In this case:\n$x_1[n] = \\sin\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_2+kf_s}{f_s}n + \\phi_1\\right) = \\sin\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_2}{f_s}n + 2\\pi k n + \\phi_1\\right)$\nSince $k$ and $n$ are integers, $2\\pi k n$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. Because the sine function is periodic with period $2\\pi$, this simplifies to:\n$x_1[n] = \\sin\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_2}{f_s}n + \\phi_1\\right)$\nFor $x_1[n]$ to be identical to $x_2[n]$, the phases must be equal: $\\phi_1 \\equiv \\phi_2 \\pmod{2\\pi}$.\n\n**Condition II: Inverting Aliasing**\nThe arguments are related by the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\sin(\\pi - \\theta)$. This occurs if the frequencies are related by $f_1 = -f_2 + k f_s$ for some non-zero integer $k$. In this case:\n$x_1[n] = \\sin\\left(2\\pi \\frac{-f_2+kf_s}{f_s}n + \\phi_1\\right) = \\sin\\left(-2\\pi \\frac{f_2}{f_s}n + 2\\pi k n + \\phi_1\\right) = \\sin\\left(-2\\pi \\frac{f_2}{f_s}n + \\phi_1\\right)$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(-x) = \\sin(x+\\pi)$, we get:\n$x_1[n] = \\sin\\left(2\\pi \\frac{f_2}{f_s}n - \\phi_1 + \\pi\\right)$\nFor $x_1[n]$ to be identical to $x_2[n]$, the resulting phases must be equal: $-\\phi_1 + \\pi \\equiv \\phi_2 \\pmod{2\\pi}$, which is equivalent to $\\phi_1 + \\phi_2 \\equiv \\pi \\pmod{2\\pi}$.\n\nWe are given $f_s = 200\\,\\text{Hz}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. It describes the Gibbs phenomenon for a square wave using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), a standard topic in computational physics and signal processing. The provided definitions are standard, and the regime $1 \\ll M \\ll N$ is appropriate for analyzing the correspondence between the discrete and continuous Fourier analysis. I will proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem investigates the properties of a signal reconstructed from a truncated Fourier spectrum. The starting point is the function $f(t) = A\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}))$, which is a square wave. It equals $A$ for $t \\in (0, T/2)$ and $-A$ for $t \\in (T/2, T)$, with jump discontinuities at integer multiples of $T/2$. The jump at $t=0$ is from $f(0^-)=-A$ to $f(0^+)=A$, so the jump magnitude is $\\Delta f = A - (-A) = 2A$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe reconstructed function $g_M(t_n)$ is based on a sharp spectral truncation. In the regime $1 \\ll M \\ll N$, this discrete reconstruction closely approximates the continuous partial Fourier series sum:\n$$g_M(t) = \\sum_{k=-M}^{M} c_k e^{j k \\omega_0 t}, \\quad \\text{where } \\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}$$\nThe complex Fourier coefficients $c_k$ for this odd function are purely imaginary, $c_k = -j\\frac{2A}{k\\pi}$ for odd $k$ and $c_k = 0$ for even $k$. The resulting partial sum is:\n$$g_M(t) = \\frac{4A}{\\pi} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor (M-1)/2 \\rfloor} \\frac{\\sin((2j+1)\\omega_0 t)}{2j+1}$$\nThis function $g_M(t)$ is known to exhibit the Gibbs phenomenon near the discontinuities of $f(t)$.\n\nA. As $M$ increases, the peak overshoot of $g_M(t)$ adjacent to the discontinuity approaches approximately $0.08949\\,\\Delta f$ and does not vanish with increasing $M$, independent of $N$.\nThe first peak of the overshoot for large $M$ occurs at $t_p \\approx T/(2M)$. The value of the function at this peak, in the limit $M \\to \\infty$, is given by:\n$$g_\\infty(t_p) = \\frac{2A}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} dx = \\frac{2A}{\\pi} \\mathrm{Si}(\\pi)$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Si}(\\pi) \\approx 1.85194$ is the sine integral. The limit of the function just past the jump is $f(0^+) = A$. The overshoot is the difference between the peak and this limit value:\n$$\\text{Overshoot} = g_\\infty(t_p) - A = A \\left( \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\mathrm{Si}(\\pi) - 1 \\right) \\approx A(1.17898 - 1) = 0.17898 A$$\nSince the jump magnitude is $\\Delta f = 2A$, the overshoot is approximately $0.17898 (\\Delta f / 2) = 0.08949 \\Delta f$. This is a constant fraction of the jump that does not vanish as $M$ increases. The 'independent of $N$' part is true because we assume $N \\gg M$, which means the discretization error is negligible and does not affect the phenomenon.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The characteristic temporal width of the main ringing lobe (for example, the time from the discontinuity to the first zero-crossing of the oscillation) scales proportionally to $1/M$.\nThe 'frequency' of the ringing is determined by the highest frequency component included in the sum, which is proportional to $M$. By the uncertainty principle in Fourier analysis, a signal with a spectral bandwidth of $\\Delta\\omega \\sim M\\omega_0$ will have temporal features of a width $\\Delta t \\sim 1/\\Delta\\omega \\sim 1/(M\\omega_0)$. Since $\\omega_0=2\\pi/T$ is a constant, the temporal width scales as $T/M$. Specifically, the first peak of the Gibbs ringing occurs at $t_p \\approx T/(2M)$, and the following minimum at $t_m \\approx T/M$. The distance from the discontinuity to the first peak, or the distance between the first peak and first minimum, both scale as $1/M$. Therefore, any reasonable definition of the characteristic width of the ringing lobe will exhibit this scaling.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. If, before inverse transforming, the truncated spectrum $\\{X_k\\}_{|k|\\le M}$ is zero-padded by an integer factor $L1$ (producing an $LN$-point inverse DFT on a finer time grid), then the maximum overshoot of $g_M(t)$ is reduced by a factor $1/L$ compared to the unpadded case.\nZero-padding in the frequency domain is a standard technique for interpolation in the time domain. It does not alter the underlying continuous-time function being sampled; it only provides more samples of it. The function exhibiting the Gibbs overshoot is $g_M(t)$, whose shape and peak value are determined by $M$ and the original function's jump, not by the number of sample points $N$. Zero-padding will not change the maximum value of $g_M(t)$. It will only create a denser set of points $g_M(t'_m)$ which may sample closer to the true peak, potentially increasing the *observed* maximum in the discrete data, but it will never reduce it. The statement is fundamentally incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Replacing the sharp spectral truncation by Cesàro (Fejér) summation, i.e., multiplying the retained Fourier modes by triangular weights $w_k=1-|k|/(M+1)$ for $|k|\\le M$ and $w_k=0$ otherwise, removes the oscillatory overshoot near the discontinuity and yields convergence of $g_M(t)$ at the discontinuity to the midpoint value $(f_+ + f_-)/2$ as $M\\to\\infty$, where $f_\\pm$ are the one-sided limits.\nThis statement accurately describes the properties of Cesàro summation. Using these weights is equivalent to convolving the function $f(t)$ with the Fejér kernel, which, unlike the Dirichlet kernel associated with sharp truncation, is a non-negative function. Convolution with a non-negative kernel cannot produce values outside the range of the original function. For the square wave, the reconstructed values will be confined to $[-A, A]$, thus eliminating any overshoot. Furthermore, Fejér's theorem guarantees that for any function with a simple jump discontinuity, the Cesàro-summed Fourier series converges to the arithmetic mean of the left and right limits at the point of discontinuity. For the square wave at $t=0$, this limit is $(f(0^+) + f(0^-))/2 = (A + (-A))/2 = 0$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. At fixed $M$, increasing $N$ alone eventually eliminates the Gibbs ringing in $g_M(t)$ because the DFT becomes a better approximation to the continuous Fourier series.\nThe Gibbs phenomenon is an inherent property of the sharply truncated continuous Fourier series $g_M(t)$; it is not an artifact of the discretization (sampling). In the regime $M \\ll N$, the DFT-based reconstruction $g_M(t_n)$ is already a very good approximation of $g_M(t)$ sampled at points $t_n$. Increasing $N$ while keeping $M$ fixed only improves this approximation, providing a more detailed picture of the very same ringing. It does not, and cannot, eliminate the ringing, whose presence is dictated by the choice of a finite $M$ and the sharp truncation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
