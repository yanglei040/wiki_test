To leverage the power of standard numerical solvers, which are typically designed for first-order systems, we must first master the technique of reduction. This exercise  challenges you to generalize this process by writing a program that can convert any explicit $n$-th order ODE into its equivalent first-order system, providing a robust tool for your computational toolkit. By testing your implementation against canonical equations with known exact solutions, you will gain confidence in this fundamental and widely applicable method.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a well-posed task in computational mathematics, specifically the numerical solution of higher-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The methodology prescribed—reduction to a first-order system—is a standard and fundamental technique. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and provides all necessary information to proceed with a solution. The test cases are canonical examples from physics and mathematics for which exact solutions are known, allowing for a quantitative evaluation of the numerical method's accuracy.\n\nThe core principle is the transformation of an explicit $n$-th order ODE of the form\n$$\ny^{(n)}(t) = G\\big(t, y(t), y^{(1)}(t), \\dots, y^{(n-1)}(t)\\big)\n$$\ninto an equivalent system of $n$ first-order ODEs. This is achieved by defining a state vector $X(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ as:\n$$\nX(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0(t) \\\\ x_1(t) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{n-1}(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y(t) \\\\ y^{(1)}(t) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y^{(n-1)}(t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe time evolution of this state vector is governed by a first-order system $\\frac{d}{dt}X(t) = F(t, X(t))$, where the function $F: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{n-2} \\\\ x_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{n-1} \\\\ G(t, x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis structure arises directly from the definition of the state variables, where $\\frac{d}{dt}x_k = \\frac{d}{dt}y^{(k)} = y^{(k+1)} = x_{k+1}$ for $k = 0, \\dots, n-2$, and the final component is given by the original ODE, $\\frac{d}{dt}x_{n-1} = \\frac{d}{dt}y^{(n-1)} = y^{(n)} = G(t, y, y', \\dots, y^{(n-1)})$.\n\nThe solution will be implemented as follows:\n$1$. A constructor function, as specified in the problem, will be created. This function will accept the order $n$ and the right-hand side function $G$ and return the system function $F(t, X)$.\n$2$. For each test case, the corresponding parameters ($n$, $G$, initial conditions $X(0)$, final time $T$) and the exact analytical solution $y_{\\text{exact}}(t)$ will be defined.\n$3$. The numerical solution will be obtained using the `solve_ivp` function from the `scipy.integrate` library, which is a robust, adaptive solver suitable for such initial value problems. The integration will be evaluated at $201$ uniformly spaced time points $t_j$ in the interval $[0, T]$.\n$4$. The maximum absolute error $E = \\max_{j} |y_{\\text{num}}(t_j) - y_{\\text{exact}}(t_j)|$ will be computed, where $y_{\\text{num}}(t_j)$ is the first component of the state vector at time $t_j$.\n$5$. The errors for all three cases will be collected and reported in the specified format.\n\nThe details for each test case are as follows:\n\nCase $1$: Second-order linear oscillator\nThe ODE is $y^{(2)}(t) + \\omega^2 y(t) = 0$ with $\\omega = 2.0$. This is equivalent to $y^{(2)}(t) = -4y(t)$.\nThe order is $n=2$. The state vector is $X = (y, y') = (x_0, x_1)$.\nThe function $G$ is $G(t, x_0, x_1) = -4x_0$.\nThe system is $\\frac{d}{dt}(x_0, x_1) = (x_1, -4x_0)$.\nThe initial condition is $X(0) = (y(0), y'(0)) = (1.0, 0.0)$.\nThe integration interval is $[0, 3.0]$.\nThe exact solution is $y_{\\text{exact}}(t) = \\cos(2t)$.\n\nCase $2$: Third-order scalar equation\nThe ODE is $y^{(3)}(t) = -y(t)$.\nThe order is $n=3$. The state vector is $X = (y, y', y'') = (x_0, x_1, x_2)$.\nThe function $G$ is $G(t, x_0, x_1, x_2) = -x_0$.\nThe system is $\\frac{d}{dt}(x_0, x_1, x_2) = (x_1, x_2, -x_0)$.\nThe initial condition is $X(0) = (y(0), y'(0), y''(0)) = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)$.\nThe integration interval is $[0, 1.0]$.\nTo find the exact solution, we solve the characteristic equation $r^3 + 1 = 0$. The roots are $r_1 = -1$, $r_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and $r_3 = \\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The general solution is $y(t) = C_1 e^{-t} + e^{t/2}(C_2 \\cos(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t) + C_3 \\sin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t))$. Applying the initial conditions yields the constants $C_1 = -1/3$, $C_2 = 1/3$, and $C_3 = \\sqrt{3}/3$.\nThus, the exact solution is $y_{\\text{exact}}(t) = -\\frac{1}{3}e^{-t} + \\frac{1}{3}e^{t/2}\\cos(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t) + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}e^{t/2}\\sin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}t)$.\n\nCase $3$: Fourth-order polynomial dynamics\nThe ODE is $y^{(4)}(t) = 0$.\nThe order is $n=4$. The state vector is $X = (y, y', y'', y''') = (x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)$.\nThe function $G$ is $G(t, x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3) = 0$.\nThe system is $\\frac{d}{dt}(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1, x_2, x_3, 0)$.\nThe initial condition is $X(0) = (y(0), y'(0), y''(0), y'''(0)) = (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)$.\nThe integration interval is $[0, 2.0]$.\nThe exact solution is found by integrating $y^{(4)}(t)=0$ four times. This gives a cubic polynomial $y(t) = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d$. The coefficients are determined by the initial conditions: $y(t) = \\frac{y'''(0)}{6}t^3 + \\frac{y''(0)}{2}t^2 + y'(0)t + y(0)$.\nSubstituting the given values: $a = 4/6 = 2/3$, $b = 3/2 = 1.5$, $c = 2$, $d = 1$.\nThe exact solution is $y_{\\text{exact}}(t) = \\frac{2}{3}t^3 + \\frac{3}{2}t^2 + 2t + 1$.",

It is based on the fundamental Fermat's principle in optics and the standard mathematical framework of the calculus of variations for deriving equations of motion. All required parameters and conditions are provided for each test case. The problem is a standard exercise in computational physics related to the reduction of higher-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the trajectory of a light ray $y(x)$ in a medium with a variable refractive index $n(y)$. According to Fermat's principle, the light ray follows a path that extremizes the optical path length, given by the functional $S$:\n$$\nS[y] = \\int n(y) \\, ds\n$$\nwhere $ds = \\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$ is the infinitesimal arc length. Parameterizing the path as $y(x)$, we can write $ds = \\sqrt{1 + (y'(x))^2} \\, dx$, where $y'(x) = dy/dx$. The functional becomes:\n$$\nS[y] = \\int_{0}^{L} n(y(x)) \\sqrt{1 + (y'(x))^2} \\, dx\n$$\nThis is a classic problem in the calculus of variations. The integrand, $F(y, y') = n(y)\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$, is the Lagrangian for the system. The path $y(x)$ that extremizes this integral must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'}\\right) = 0\n$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives of $F(y, y') = n(y)\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{dn}{dy} \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} = n'(y) \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = n(y) \\frac{y'}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives the ray equation:\n$$\nn'(y) \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\frac{n(y)y'}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nTo obtain an explicit second-order ODE for $y(x)$, we must evaluate the total derivative with respect to $x$. Let us rearrange the equation first:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\frac{n(y)y'}{\\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} \\right) = n'(y) \\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}\n$$\nBy applying the chain rule to the term being differentiated, $\\frac{d}{dx} = y' \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + y'' \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y'}$, and then solving for $y''$, we arrive at the following second-order ODE after algebraic simplification:\n$$\ny'' = \\frac{n'(y)}{n(y)} \\left(1 + (y')^2\\right)\n$$\nThis is the governing differential equation for the ray path $y(x)$.\n\nThe next task is to reduce this second-order ODE to a system of two first-order ODEs. We introduce the state variables as requested: $u_1(x) = y(x)$ and $u_2(x) = v(x) = y'(x)$. The state vector is $\\mathbf{u}(x) = [u_1(x), u_2(x)]^T$. We seek a system of the form $d\\mathbf{u}/dx = \\mathbf{f}(x, \\mathbf{u})$.\n\nThe first equation of the system comes directly from the definition of $u_2(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{du_1}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{dx} = y' = v = u_2\n$$\nThe second equation is obtained by substituting the state variables into the governing ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{du_2}{dx} = \\frac{dv}{dx} = y'' = \\frac{n'(y)}{n(y)} (1 + (y')^2) = \\frac{n'(u_1)}{n(u_1)} (1 + u_2^2)\n$$\nThus, the first-order system is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\begin{pmatrix} y \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\frac{n'(y)}{n(y)}(1+v^2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe initial conditions at $x=0$ are given as $y(0) = y_0$ and an angle $\\theta_0$ with the x-axis. The initial slope is $y'(0) = v(0) = \\tan(\\theta_0)$. The initial state vector for the numerical integration is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} y(0) \\\\ v(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta_0) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis initial value problem can be solved numerically from $x=0$ to $x=L$ using standard methods like the Runge-Kutta family. After integrating, we obtain the final state vector $\\mathbf{u}(L) = [y(L), v(L)]^T$. The final transverse position is $y(L)$.

            "problem": "Consider a nonrelativistic point electron moving along one spatial dimension under a prescribed external electric field $E(t)$ in the absence of magnetic fields. The electron has charge $q=-e$ and mass $m=m_e$. The Abraham–Lorentz radiation-reaction model states that the net force equals the sum of the external force and a radiation-reaction term proportional to the time derivative of acceleration. Starting from Newton's second law and the radiation-reaction model, the governing equation for the position $x(t)$ is a third-order ordinary differential equation in time, involving $x(t)$, $\\dot{x}(t)$, $\\ddot{x}(t)$, and $\\dddot{x}(t)$. Your tasks are:\n\n- Derive a first-order system of ordinary differential equations equivalent to this third-order equation by introducing appropriate state variables. Clearly identify the state variables, their physical meanings, and their first-order time derivatives in terms of each other and the external field.\n- Explain and adopt a physically motivated boundary condition that removes runaway (exponentially growing) solutions, and state how it changes the well-posedness of the problem.\n- Implement a robust numerical strategy based on this first-order system to compute the final position $x(T)$ for several prescribed external fields. Your implementation must be a complete, runnable program, with no user input, that numerically integrates the required system and prints the requested results in the exact format described below.\n\nFundamental base and constants to use:\n- Newton's second law: $m\\,\\ddot{x}(t)=F_{\\text{net}}(t)$.\n- External electric force: $F_{\\text{ext}}(t)=q\\,E(t)$.\n- Abraham–Lorentz radiation-reaction model: $F_{\\text{rr}}(t)=m\\,\\tau\\,\\dot{a}(t)$, where $a(t)=\\ddot{x}(t)$ and $\\tau$ is a constant given by\n$$\n\\tau=\\frac{2\\,e^2}{3\\,4\\pi\\,\\varepsilon_0\\,m\\,c^3}.\n$$\n- Physical constants in the International System of Units (SI) to be used numerically in your code:\n    - Elementary charge $e=1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.\n    - Electron mass $m_e=9.1093837015\\times 10^{-31}$ kilograms.\n    - Vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0=8.8541878128\\times 10^{-12}$ farads per meter.\n    - Speed of light $c=299792458$ meters per second.\n\nInitial and boundary conditions:\n- Use $x(0)=0$ meters and $\\dot{x}(0)=0$ meters per second.\n- Impose the physically acceptable, non-runaway condition that $a(t)\\to 0$ as $t\\to +\\infty$. For practical computation, enforce $a(T)=0$ at a sufficiently large finite time $T$ where $E(t)$ is negligible.\n\nNumerical strategy requirements:\n- To obtain a stable and accurate computation that respects the non-runaway condition, reduce the third-order equation to a first-order system in the variables $x(t)$, $v(t)=\\dot{x}(t)$, and $a(t)=\\ddot{x}(t)$. Then, exploit the fact that the equation for $a(t)$ is linear and first order in time to compute $a(t)$ on $[0,T]$ subject to $a(T)=0$ and the given $E(t)$. Next, compute $v(t)$ and $x(t)$ on $[0,T]$ using their definitions in terms of $a(t)$. You may use any scientifically sound discretization and ordinary differential equation integration method consistent with the above physical requirements.\n- Angles are not used; no angle unit specification is needed.\n- All reported positions must be expressed in meters.\n\nTest suite:\nYour program must compute $x(T)$ for each of the following three external fields.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is a well-posed problem in computational physics, based on established, albeit simplified, principles of classical electrodynamics. The formulation is self-contained, objective, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution under the prescribed physical boundary condition. I will now proceed with the derivation and construction of the numerical solution.\n\nThe motion of the nonrelativistic electron is governed by Newton's second law, where the net force is the sum of the external electric force and the Abraham-Lorentz radiation-reaction force. The equation is:\n$$\nm\\,\\ddot{x}(t) = F_{\\text{net}}(t) = F_{\\text{ext}}(t) + F_{\\text{rr}}(t)\n$$\nHere, $m$ is the electron mass, $x(t)$ is its position, $F_{\\text{ext}}(t) = q\\,E(t)$ is the external force from the electric field $E(t)$ with charge $q=-e$, and $F_{\\text{rr}}(t) = m\\,\\tau\\,\\dot{a}(t)$ is the radiation-reaction force. The quantity $a(t) = \\ddot{x}(t)$ is the acceleration, and $\\tau = \\frac{2\\,e^2}{3\\,4\\pi\\,\\varepsilon_0\\,m\\,c^3}$ is the characteristic time constant of the radiation reaction. Substituting these expressions yields the governing equation:\n$$\nm\\,\\ddot{x}(t) = q\\,E(t) + m\\,\\tau\\,\\dddot{x}(t)\n$$\nThis is a third-order linear ordinary differential equation for the position $x(t)$. It is customary to write it with the highest derivative isolated:\n$$\n\\dddot{x}(t) - \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\ddot{x}(t) = \\frac{q}{m\\,\\tau}E(t)\n$$\n\nTo solve this equation numerically, we reduce it to a system of first-order differential equations. We introduce a state vector $\\mathbf{y}(t)$ whose components are the physically meaningful quantities of position, velocity, and acceleration. Let the state variables be:\n- $y_1(t) = x(t)$: position\n- $y_2(t) = v(t) = \\dot{x}(t)$: velocity\n- $y_3(t) = a(t) = \\ddot{x}(t)$: acceleration\n\nThe first-order time derivatives of these state variables are then expressed in terms of the state variables themselves and the external forcing function $E(t)$. The first two are definitions:\n$$\n\\dot{y}_1(t) = \\dot{x}(t) = v(t) = y_2(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y}_2(t) = \\dot{v}(t) = a(t) = y_3(t)\n$$\nThe third equation is obtained from the governing third-order ODE by substituting the state variables:\n$$\n\\dot{y}_3(t) = \\dot{a}(t) = \\dddot{x}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\ddot{x}(t) + \\frac{q}{m\\,\\tau}E(t) = \\frac{1}{\\tau}y_3(t) + \\frac{q}{m\\,\\tau}E(t)\n$$\nThus, the equivalent first-order system is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\tau}y_3 + \\frac{q}{m\\,\\tau}E(t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe equation for acceleration, $\\dot{a}(t) - \\frac{1}{\\tau}a(t) = \\frac{q}{m\\,\\tau}E(t)$, has a homogeneous part $\\dot{a}_h(t) - \\frac{1}{\\tau}a_h(t) = 0$ whose solution is $a_h(t) = C\\,e^{t/\\tau}$ for some constant $C$. This solution grows exponentially in time and is referred to as a \"runaway\" solution. Such behavior is unphysical; an electron's acceleration should not grow without bound in the absence of a continuously growing external force. The problem statement correctly mandates the adoption of a physical condition to eliminate this non-physical behavior, namely that $a(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This condition forces the constant $C$ to be zero, thereby selecting the unique physically acceptable solution from an infinite family of mathematical solutions. For a numerical computation over a finite interval $[0, T]$, where $T$ is chosen such that $E(t)$ is negligible for $t \\ge T$, this condition is imposed as $a(T)=0$.\n\nThe combination of two initial conditions, $x(0)=0$ and $\\dot{x}(0)=0$, with the final boundary condition $a(T)=0$ makes the problem a boundary value problem, not a simple initial value problem. The numerical strategy must respect this structure. The problem is decoupled. The equation for $a(t)$ can be solved first, independently of $x(t)$ and $v(t)$, as it does not depend on them. We must solve the linear first-order equation for $a(t)$ with a final value condition. A standard technique for this is time reversal. Let $s = T-t$, which implies $t=T-s$ and $\\frac{d}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{ds}$. The ODE for $a(t(s))$ becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{da}{ds} = \\frac{1}{\\tau}a(s) + \\frac{q}{m\\,\\tau}E(T-s)\n$$\nRearranging gives a standard initial value problem for $a(s)$:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{ds} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}a(s) - \\frac{q}{m\\,\\tau}E(T-s)\n$$\nThe boundary condition $a(t=T)=0$ becomes an initial condition $a(s=0)=0$. This equation can be robustly integrated forward in $s$ from $s=0$ to $s=T$ using a standard numerical solver like a Runge-Kutta method. The result is the function $a(s)$ on the interval $[0, T]$. Reversing the resulting array of values gives the solution $a(t)$ on the interval $[0, T]$.\n\nOnce the acceleration $a(t)$ is determined numerically on a discrete time grid, the velocity $v(t)$ and position $x(t)$ are obtained by successive integrations, using the initial conditions $v(0)=0$ and $x(0)=0$:\n$$\nv(t) = v(0) + \\int_0^t a(t') dt' = \\int_0^t a(t') dt'\n$$\n$$\nx(t) = x(0) + \\int_0^t v(t') dt' = \\int_0^t v(t') dt'\n$$\nThese integrations are performed numerically. For instance, the cumulative trapezoidal rule is suitable. The final position $x(T)$ is the last value obtained in the numerical integration for $x(t)$. This completes the design of the numerical solution.",
