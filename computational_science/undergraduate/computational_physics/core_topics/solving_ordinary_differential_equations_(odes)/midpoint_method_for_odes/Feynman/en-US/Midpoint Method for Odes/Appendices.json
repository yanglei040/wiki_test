            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It presents a well-posed verification task based on the method of manufactured solutions, a standard technique in computational science for assessing the accuracy of numerical schemes. All provided information is complete, consistent, and scientifically grounded.\n\nThe task is to compute the global error of the midpoint method for a specific ordinary differential equation (ODE) over a fixed interval for a given set of step sizes.\n\nFirst, we define the components of the initial value problem (IVP). The exact solution is given as:\n$$\ny(t) = e^{-2 t}\\,\\big(\\sin(3 t) + t^2\\big)\n$$\nfor the time interval $t \\in [0, T]$, where the final time is $T=2$.\n\nThe IVP is constructed from this solution. The initial condition is the value of the exact solution at $t=0$:\n$$\ny(0) = e^{-2(0)}\\big(\\sin(3(0)) + 0^2\\big) = 1 \\cdot (0 + 0) = 0\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the ODE, which we denote as $f(t, y)$, is the time derivative of the exact solution. Since the derivative of $y(t)$ depends only on $t$, we can write the ODE as $\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t)$. We compute this derivative using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( u(t) v(t) \\right) = u'(t)v(t) + u(t)v'(t)\n$$\nLet $u(t) = e^{-2t}$ and $v(t) = \\sin(3t) + t^2$. Their derivatives are:\n$$\nu'(t) = -2e^{-2t}\n$$\n$$\nv'(t) = 3\\cos(3t) + 2t\n$$\nApplying the product rule, we obtain the function $f(t)$:\n$$\nf(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt} = (-2e^{-2t})\\big(\\sin(3t) + t^2\\big) + (e^{-2t})\\big(3\\cos(3t) + 2t\\big)\n$$\n$$\nf(t) = e^{-2t}\\big(-2\\sin(3t) - 2t^2 + 3\\cos(3t) + 2t\\big)\n$$\nThis function $f(t)$ defines the right-hand side of our ODE, $\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t)$.\n\nNext, we define the numerical method. The midpoint method is a second-order Runge-Kutta method. For a general ODE $\\frac{dy}{dt} = F(t, y)$, a single step from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$ is given by:\n$$\nk_1 = F(t_n, y_n)\n$$\n$$\nk_2 = F(t_n + h/2, y_n + (h/2)k_1)\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + h k_2\n$$\nIn our specific case, the right-hand side $F(t, y)$ is independent of $y$, i.e., $F(t, y) = f(t)$. The formula simplifies significantly:\n$$\nk_1 = f(t_n)\n$$\n$$\nk_2 = f(t_n + h/2)\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n + h/2)\n$$\nThis is the iterative scheme we will use to approximate the solution.\n\nThe algorithm to find the numerical solution $y_{\\text{num}}(T)$ is as follows. We are given the interval $[0, T] = [0, 2]$ and a set of step sizes $h \\in \\{1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05\\}$. For each $h$:\n1.  Calculate the number of steps, $N = T/h$. This will be an integer for the given values.\n2.  Initialize the solution at the starting time: $t_0 = 0$, $y_0 = y(0) = 0$.\n3.  Iterate for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1$:\n    -   The current time is $t_n = n \\cdot h$.\n    -   The midpoint in time for the current step is $t_{n+1/2} = t_n + h/2$.\n    -   The next value of the solution is computed as $y_{n+1} = y_n + h \\cdot f(t_{n+1/2})$.\n4.  After $N$ steps, the numerical approximation at the final time $T=2$ is $y_{\\text{num}}(T) = y_N$.\n\nFinally, we compute the global error. The exact value at the final time $T=2$ is:\n$$\ny(2) = e^{-2(2)}\\big(\\sin(3 \\cdot 2) + 2^2\\big) = e^{-4}\\big(\\sin(6) + 4\\big)\n$$\nThe global error $E_h$ for a given step size $h$ is the absolute difference between the numerical approximation and the exact value:\n$$\nE_h = |y_{\\text{num}}(T) - y(T)| = |y_N - y(2)|\n$$\nThis procedure is repeated for each specified value of $h$. The resulting errors are then rounded to $12$ decimal places as required. The implementation will use numerical libraries to evaluate the exponential and trigonometric functions, with angles in radians as specified.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed initial value problem in computational physics, requiring the numerical integration of the Lotka-Volterra equations. The problem is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a unique solution. The validation criteria are met.\n\nThe system is defined by a pair of autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for two interacting populations, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = x(a - by)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = y(-c + dx)\n$$\nwhere $a, b, c, d$ are positive real parameters. This system can be written in vector form as $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{u})$, where $\\mathbf{u}(t) = [x(t), y(t)]^T$ and the vector field $\\mathbf{f}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(a - by) \\\\ y(-c + dx) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem requires advancing the solution from an initial state $\\mathbf{u}_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ at time $t=0$ to a final time $t=T$ using the explicit midpoint method with a fixed time step $h$. The explicit midpoint method is a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme defined by the following steps to advance the solution from $\\mathbf{u}_n$ at time $t_n$ to $\\mathbf{u}_{n+1}$ at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$:\n\n$1$.

However, numerical methods such as the explicit midpoint method do not typically preserve such invariants exactly. The deviation of the numerical invariant over time is a measure of the method's error. We are asked to compute the absolute drift $\\Delta I$ at the final time $T$:\n$$\n\\Delta I = |I(x(T), y(T)) - I(x_0, y_0)|\n$$\nFor a method of order $p$, the global error is expected to scale as $O(h^p)$. The drift in the conserved quantity, $\\Delta I(h)$, is also expected to exhibit this scaling for a non-symplectic integrator. The observed order of convergence, $p$, can be computed from the results of two different step sizes, $h_1$ and $h_2$, using the formula:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\ln(\\Delta I(h_2) / \\Delta I(h_1))}{\\ln(h_2 / h_1)}\n$$\n\nThe provided test cases are analyzed as follows:\n- **Cases A and B**: These are standard numerical integrations with different step sizes ($h=0.1$ and $h=0.05$). The results will be non-zero values for $\\Delta I$.\n- **Case C**: This requires computing the observed order $p$ from the results of cases A and B. Since the explicit midpoint method is a second-order method ($p_{theory}=2$), the result should be close to $2$.\n- **Case D**: The initial condition $(x_0, y_0) = (c/d, a/b)$ corresponds to the non-trivial fixed point (or equilibrium) of the system, where $dx/dt = 0$ and $dy/dt = 0$. For a consistent numerical method, if the simulation starts at a fixed point, it should remain there for all time, up to machine precision. Therefore, $(x(T), y(T)) = (x_0, y_0)$, and we expect $\\Delta I = 0$.\n- **Case E**: The integration is over a time interval of zero length ($T=0$). No time steps are taken, so the final state is identical to the initial state. Thus, $(x(T), y(T)) = (x_0, y_0)$, and we expect $\\Delta I = 0$.\n\nThe following algorithm will be implemented:\n$1$.

Define the two half-step composition by first computing $y_{h/2}^{(1)} = \\Phi_{h/2}(t,y)$ and then $y_{h/2}^{(2)} = \\Phi_{h/2}(t + h/2,\\, y_{h/2}^{(1)})$. Use $y_{h/2}^{(2)}$ as the higher-quality approximation at the end of the step.\n\n- The local error estimate for a step of size $h$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathrm{err} = \\frac{\\lvert y_{h/2}^{(2)} - y_h \\rvert}{2^2 - 1}.\n$$\n\n- For a given absolute tolerance $\\mathrm{atol}$ and relative tolerance $\\mathrm{rtol}$, define the scalar acceptance threshold\n$$\n\\tau = \\mathrm{atol} + \\mathrm{rtol} \\cdot \\max\\!\\big(\\lvert y_h \\rvert,\\, \\lvert y_{h/2}^{(2)} \\rvert\\big).\n$$\nAccept the step if $\\mathrm{err} \\le \\tau$. When a step is accepted, advance $(t,y) \\leftarrow (t+h,\\, y_{h/2}^{(2)})$.\n\n- Upon each attempted step (whether accepted or rejected), update the step size according to the controller\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{new}} = h \\cdot \\mathrm{clip}\\!\\left(s \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\mathrm{err}}\\right)^{1/3},\\, \\alpha_{\\min},\\, \\alpha_{\\max}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $s$ is a safety factor, the exponent $1/3$ follows from the leading local error of order $h^3$ for a second-order method, and $\\mathrm{clip}(x, a, b)$ constrains $x$ to the interval $[a,b]$. If $\\mathrm{err} = 0$, use the maximal growth factor, i.e., set the multiplicative term to $\\alpha_{\\max}$. Ensure that $h$ never steps past the target final time by truncating the last step if necessary so that the final time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ is reached exactly. Angles appearing in any trigonometric function must be interpreted in radians.\n\n- Use fixed controller parameters $s = 0.9$, $\\alpha_{\\min} = 0.2$, $\\alpha_{\\max} = 5.0$, and a minimum step size $h_{\\min} = 10^{-16}$. If $h$ falls below $h_{\\min}$ before reaching $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, terminate the integration and return the current approximation.\n\nImplement the integrator and apply it to the following test suite. Each test case specifies $f(t,y)$, $t_0$, $y_0$, $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, initial step size $h_0$, $\\mathrm{rtol}$, and $\\mathrm{atol}$. All numbers are unitless. All angles are in radians.\n\n- Test case $1$ (exponential decay):\n  - $f(t,y) = -2\\, y$,\n  - $t_0 = 0$,\n  - $y_0 = 1$,\n  - $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1$,\n  - $h_0 = 0.1$,\n  - $\\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-8}$,\n  - $\\mathrm{atol} = 10^{-12}$.\n\n- Test case $2$ (logistic growth with unit carrying capacity):\n  - $f(t,y) = y \\, (1 - y)$,\n  - $t_0 = 0$,\n  - $y_0 = 0.2$,\n  - $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 5$,\n  - $h_0 = 0.2$,\n  - $\\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-7}$,\n  - $\\mathrm{atol} = 10^{-12}$.\n\n- Test case $3$ (linear equation with trigonometric forcing):\n  - $f(t,y) = \\cos(t) - y$,\n  - $t_0 = 0$,\n  - $y_0 = 0$,\n  - $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 4$,\n  - $h_0 = 0.1$,\n  - $\\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-9}$,\n  - $\\mathrm{atol} = 10^{-12}$.\n\n- Test case $4$ (fast exponential decay):\n  - $f(t,y) = -50\\, y$,\n  - $t_0 = 0$,\n  - $y_0 = 1$,\n  - $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 0.1$,\n  - $h_0 = 0.05$,\n  - $\\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-6}$,\n  - $\\mathrm{atol} = 10^{-12}$.\n\nYour program must run all four test cases in the order listed and, for each, return the numerical approximation of $y(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$. The final output must be a single line containing a Python-style list of the four results as decimal numbers, each rounded to exactly $10$ decimal places, in the order of the test suite, for example, $[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4]$ where each $x_i$ is a float with $10$ digits after the decimal point. Your program must produce exactly one line of output in this format and must not read any input.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It presents a well-defined task in computational physics: the numerical integration of a scalar ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the explicit midpoint method with an adaptive step-size controller. The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and all parameters and mathematical relations are specified unambiguously. I will now provide the solution.\n\nThe fundamental challenge in solving an ODE of the form $y'(t) = f(t,y)$ with an initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$ is to approximate the continuous trajectory of $y(t)$ using a discrete sequence of points. An adaptive-step integrator is superior to a fixed-step integrator as it adjusts the step size $h$ to maintain a desired level of accuracy while minimizing computational effort, taking small steps in regions where the solution changes rapidly and large steps where it is smooth.\n\nThe core of the integrator is the explicit midpoint method, a second-order Runge-Kutta method. For a step from time $t$ to $t+h$, the state $y$ is advanced using the one-step update function $\\Phi_h(t,y)$:\n$$\n\\Phi_h(t,y) = y + h \\, f\\!\\left(t + \\frac{h}{2},\\, y + \\frac{h}{2} f(t,y)\\right)\n$$\nThis formula can be interpreted as a two-stage process. First, an intermediate state is estimated at the midpoint of the interval, $t+h/2$. Second, the slope at this midpoint is used to extrapolate across the full interval $h$.\n\nTo control the step size adaptively, we require an estimate of the local truncation error—the error incurred in a single step. The problem specifies a step-doubling approach. In this method, we compute the solution at $t+h$ in two ways:\n1. A single step of size $h$, yielding $y_h = \\Phi_h(t,y)$.\n2. Two consecutive steps of size $h/2$, yielding $y_{h/2}^{(2)} = \\Phi_{h/2}(t + h/2, \\Phi_{h/2}(t,y))$.\n\nSince the explicit midpoint method has a local truncation error of order $O(h^3)$, the exact solution $y(t+h)$ can be related to our numerical approximations:\n$$\ny_h = y(t+h) + C h^3 + O(h^4)\n$$\n$$\ny_{h/2}^{(2)} = y(t+h) + 2 C (h/2)^3 + O(h^4) = y(t+h) + \\frac{1}{4} C h^3 + O(h^4)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant related to the derivatives of the solution. By subtracting these two equations, we can eliminate the unknown true value $y(t+h)$ and solve for the error term, $\\frac{1}{4} C h^3$, which is the error in the more accurate two-step approximation $y_{h/2}^{(2)}$. The magnitude of this error is estimated as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{err} = \\lvert y(t+h) - y_{h/2}^{(2)} \\rvert \\approx \\frac{\\lvert y_{h/2}^{(2)} - y_h \\rvert}{2^p - 1} = \\frac{\\lvert y_{h/2}^{(2)} - y_h \\rvert}{3}\n$$\nwhere $p=2$ is the order of the method.\n\nThis error estimate is then compared against a desired tolerance threshold, $\\tau$, which is a combination of an absolute tolerance $\\mathrm{atol}$ and a relative tolerance $\\mathrm{rtol}$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\mathrm{atol} + \\mathrm{rtol} \\cdot \\max\\!\\big(\\lvert y_h \\rvert,\\, \\lvert y_{h/2}^{(2)} \\rvert\\big)\n$$\nIf $\\mathrm{err} \\le \\tau$, the step is accepted, and the state is advanced to $(t+h, y_{h/2}^{(2)})$, using the more accurate approximation. If $\\mathrm{err} > \\tau$, the step is rejected, and the step is re-attempted from the same point $(t,y)$ but with a smaller step size.\n\nThe step size for the next attempt (whether the current one was accepted or rejected) is determined by a proportional-integral (PI) controller formula:\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{new}} = h \\cdot \\mathrm{clip}\\!\\left(s \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\mathrm{err}}\\right)^{1/(p+1)},\\, \\alpha_{\\min},\\, \\alpha_{\\max}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $s=0.9$ is a safety factor to promote stability. The exponent is $1/(p+1)=1/3$ for our second-order method. The ratio $\\tau/\\mathrm{err}$ scales the step size: if the error is smaller than the tolerance, the step size is increased, and if it is larger, the step size is decreased. The $\\mathrm{clip}$ function, with minimum and maximum factors $\\alpha_{\\min}=0.2$ and $\\alpha_{\\max}=5.0$, prevents excessively aggressive changes to the step size. If $\\mathrm{err}=0$, the step size is multiplied by the maximum factor $\\alpha_{\\max}$.\n\nThe complete integration algorithm proceeds as follows:\nInitialize $t=t_0$, $y=y_0$, and an initial step size $h=h_0$. Loop until $t$ reaches $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$:\n1.  Check if the current step would overshoot $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$. If so, set $h = t_{\\mathrm{end}} - t$.\n2.  Enter an inner loop for the current step attempt.\n3.  Check if the current $h$ is below the minimum threshold $h_{\\min}$. If so, terminate the integration.\n4.  Compute $y_h$ and $y_{h/2}^{(2)}$.\n5.  Calculate the error $\\mathrm{err}$ and tolerance $\\tau$.\n6.  If the step is accepted ($\\mathrm{err} \\le \\tau$):\n    a. Advance the state: $t \\leftarrow t+h$, $y \\leftarrow y_{h/2}^{(2)}$.\n    b. Compute the next step size $h_{\\mathrm{new}}$ using the controller formula. Update $h \\leftarrow h_{\\mathrm{new}}$.\n    c. Exit the inner loop to proceed to the next integration step.\n7.  If the step is rejected ($\\mathrm{err} > \\tau$):\n    a. Compute a new, smaller step size $h_{\\mathrm{new}}$. Update $h \\leftarrow h_{\\mathrm{new}}$.\n    b. Repeat the inner loop to re-attempt the step from the same point $(t,y)$ with the smaller $h$.\n\nThis process is repeated until $t=t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, at which point the final value of $y$ is the desired numerical solution. This algorithm will be implemented for each of the four specified test cases.",
