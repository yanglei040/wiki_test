The matrix $U$ is not provided explicitly; instead, it is stored in a column-oriented compressed skyline format defined as follows.\n\nFor each column index $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, let $r_j$ be the index of the first (smallest) row in column $j$ that may contain a nonzero entry. The profile of column $j$ consists of the entries $\\{ U_{i,j} \\mid i = r_j, r_j + 1, \\dots, j \\}$, stored consecutively in a one-dimensional array $\\mathrm{val}$.

Thus, the length of column $j$’s segment is $j - r_j + 1$, and the entry on the diagonal $U_{j,j}$ is the last element of that segment. The array $\\mathrm{row\\_start}$ of length $n$ stores the values $r_j$. All indices are $0$-based, and entries above the skyline (rows $i  r_j$ in column $j$) are implicitly zero. Entries below the main diagonal are zero by the upper-triangular structure.\n\nYour task is to compute the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ for each of the following test cases.

            "solution": "The task is to solve a system of linear equations $U \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}$, where $U$ is an upper-triangular matrix with non-zero diagonal entries. The existence of a unique solution is guaranteed, as such a matrix $U$ is always invertible. The solution is found by the method of back-substitution, adapted for the specified column-oriented compressed skyline storage format.\n\nThe fundamental principle for solving an upper-triangular system $U \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}$ is back-substitution. The system is described by the equations:\n$$ \\sum_{j=i}^{n-1} U_{i,j} x_j = y_i \\quad \\text{for } i = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1 $$\nThe algorithm proceeds by solving for the variables in reverse order, from $x_{n-1}$ down to $x_0$. The last equation, for $i=n-1$, involves only one unknown:\n$$ U_{n-1,n-1} x_{n-1} = y_{n-1} \\implies x_{n-1} = \\frac{y_{n-1}}{U_{n-1,n-1}} $$\nOnce $x_{n-1}$ is known, we can substitute it into the second-to-last equation (for $i=n-2$) to solve for $x_{n-2}$. This process is repeated for all preceding variables. For a general index $i$, the formula for $x_i$ is:\n$$ x_i = \\frac{1}{U_{i,i}} \\left( y_i - \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n-1} U_{i,j} x_j \\right) $$\nThis is a row-oriented approach. However, the matrix is provided in a column-oriented compressed skyline format. A more suitable approach is a column-oriented algorithm. We can maintain a working copy of the right-hand side vector, let's call it $\\mathbf{z}$, initialized to $\\mathbf{y}$. The algorithm computes $x_j$ for $j=n-1, n-2, \\dots, 0$.\n\n1.  Initialize a solution vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and set a temporary vector $\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{y}$.\n2.  Iterate $j$ from $n-1$ down to $0$. In each iteration, we solve for $x_j$ and then update the vector $\\mathbf{z}$ to remove the contribution of the term $\\mathbf{u}_j x_j$.\n    a. First, we solve for $x_j$. At step $j$, the values $x_{j+1}, \\dots, x_{n-1}$ are known, and their effects have been subtracted from $\\mathbf{z}$. The $j$-th equation effectively becomes $U_{j,j} x_j = z_j$. Thus, we compute:\n       $$ x_j = \\frac{z_j}{U_{j,j}} $$\n    b. Next, we update the remaining elements of the temporary vector $\\mathbf{z}$. The term $\\mathbf{u}_j x_j$ contributes to the equations for rows $i  j$. We must subtract this contribution from $\\mathbf{z}$:\n       $$ z_i \\leftarrow z_i - U_{i,j} x_j \\quad \\text{for } i  j $$\n\nThis column-oriented algorithm is highly efficient for the given storage format. The non-zero entries of a column $\\mathbf{u}_j$ are $\\{ U_{i,j} \\mid i = r_j, \\dots, j \\}$, where $r_j$ is the starting row index for column $j$. These values are stored contiguously in the `val` array. The steps to solve become:\n\nLet `val`, `col_ptr`, and `row_start` be the arrays defining the matrix $U$.\n1.  Initialize `x = np.zeros(n)` and `z = np.copy(y)`.\n2.  For $j = n-1, n-2, \\dots, 0$:\n    a. The diagonal element $U_{j,j}$ is the last entry for column $j$. Its index in `val` is `col_ptr[j+1] - 1`. Calculate:\n       $$ x_j = \\frac{z_j}{\\mathrm{val}[\\mathrm{col\\_ptr}[j+1] - 1]} $$\n    b. Retrieve the starting row index for column $j$, $r_j = \\mathrm{row\\_start}[j]$.\n    c. Update the temporary vector $\\mathbf{z}$ for all rows $i$ in the profile of column $j$ (excluding the diagonal element itself):\n       For $i = r_j, r_j+1, \\dots, j-1$:\n       i. The matrix element $U_{i,j}$ is located at index `col_ptr[j] + i - r_j` in the `val` array.\n       ii. Perform the update:\n          $$ z_i \\leftarrow z_i - \\mathrm{val}[\\mathrm{col\\_ptr}[j] + i - r_j] \\times x_j $$\nThis procedure is repeated for all columns, yielding the full solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$.
