Assume that $A$ is nonsingular and that all computations are performed in double precision floating point arithmetic. Your task is to derive, from the associativity of matrix multiplication and the uniqueness of solutions for nonsingular linear systems, a method to solve $A^2 x = b$ using only operations involving $A$ without ever forming the pentadiagonal matrix $A^2$. Then, implement this method in a program that uses a tridiagonal solver based on Gaussian elimination specialized to tridiagonal matrices.

The solution must be derived from fundamental principles of linear algebra and implemented using a specialized solver for tridiagonal systems.\n\nThe validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific and mathematical soundness. It is a well-posed problem in numerical linear algebra with complete and consistent data, requiring a standard, verifiable computational method. All provided test cases involve matrices for which the proposed algorithm is numerically stable.\n\n**Derivation of the Method**\n\nThe core of the method lies in the associativity of matrix multiplication. The equation to be solved is:\n$$A^2 x = b$$\nBy the associative property, we can group the multiplication as:\n$$A(Ax) = b$$\nThis structure suggests a decomposition of the problem into a sequence of two simpler problems. We introduce an intermediate vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ defined as:\n$$y = Ax$$\nSubstituting this definition into the previous equation yields the first linear system:\n$$Ay = b$$\nSince the matrix $A$ is given to be nonsingular, a unique solution $y$ for this system exists. Once $y$ is determined, we can find the final solution $x$ by solving the second linear system, which is our initial definition of $y$:\n$$Ax = y$$\nAgain, the nonsingularity of $A$ guarantees a unique solution for $x$.\n\nThis two-step procedure correctly solves the original problem while adhering to the critical constraint of not forming the matrix $A^2$. The method consists of two sequential solves of linear systems involving the same tridiagonal matrix $A$:\n$1$. Solve $Ay = b$ to find the intermediate vector $y$.\n$2$. Solve $Ax = y$ to find the final solution vector $x$.\n\n**Algorithmic Implementation: The Thomas Algorithm**\n\nTo solve the tridiagonal systems $Ay=b$ and $Ax=y$, we employ the Thomas algorithm, also known as the Tridiagonal Matrix Algorithm (TDMA). This algorithm is a highly efficient form of Gaussian elimination specialized for tridiagonal matrices, with a computational complexity of $O(n)$, which is vastly superior to the $O(n^3)$ complexity of general Gaussian elimination.\n\nA tridiagonal system is defined by the matrix $A$ with a lower diagonal (subdiagonal) vector $a = (a_2, \\dots, a_n)$, a main diagonal vector $d = (d_1, \\dots, d_n)$, and an upper diagonal (superdiagonal) vector $c = (c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1})$. The $i$-th equation of the system $Af = g$ is:\n$$a_i f_{i-1} + d_i f_i + c_i f_{i+1} = g_i$$\nwhere, by convention, $a_1 = 0$ and $c_n = 0$.\n\nThe Thomas algorithm consists of two stages:\n\n$1$. **Forward Elimination**: The algorithm transforms the system into an equivalent upper bidiagonal system by eliminating the subdiagonal elements. This is achieved by modifying the coefficients of the main diagonal $d_i$ and the right-hand side vector $g_i$. The procedure involves computing a new set of coefficients, let us say $c'_i$ and $g'_i$:\nFor $i=1$:\n$$c'_1 = \\frac{c_1}{d_1}$$\n$$g'_1 = \\frac{g_1}{d_1}$$\nFor $i = 2, 3, \\dots, n-1$:\n$$m_i = d_i - a_i c'_{i-1}$$\n$$c'_i = \\frac{c_i}{m_i}$$\n$$g'_i = \\frac{g_i - a_i g'_{i-1}}{m_i}$$\nAnd for the last row, $i=n$:\n$$m_n = d_n - a_n c'_{n-1}$$\n$$g'_n = \\frac{g_n - a_n g'_{n-1}}{m_n}$$\nThis process is numerically stable without pivoting for matrices that are strictly or irreducibly diagonally dominant, or symmetric and positive definite, which is true for all test cases provided.\n\n$2$. **Backward Substitution**: After the forward elimination, the system has an upper bidiagonal form, which can be solved easily for the unknown vector $f$ by starting from the last equation and moving backward:\n$$f_n = g'_n$$\nFor $i = n-1, n-2, \\dots, 1$:\n$$f_i = g'_i - c'_i f_{i+1}$$\n\n**Verification of the Solution**\n\nTo assess the correctness of the computed solution $x$, we calculate the infinity norm of the residual vector, $r = b - A^2x$. As stipulated, $A^2$ is not formed. The term $A^2x$ is computed as $A(Ax)$.\nThe procedure is as follows:\n$1$. Compute the vector $y_{check} = Ax$. This is a matrix-vector multiplication involving the tridiagonal matrix $A$ and the computed solution $x$.\n$2$. Compute the vector $z_{check} = Ay_{check}$. This is a second application of the matrix $A$ to the result of the first multiplication.\n$3$. Compute the residual vector $r = b - z_{check}$.\n$4$. Compute the infinity norm of the residual, $\\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty} = \\max_{i} |r_i|$. A small residual norm indicates that the computed solution $x$ is accurate.\n\nThis comprehensive approach solves the problem efficiently and robustly, satisfying all specified constraints. The total computational cost is dominated by the two applications of the Thomas algorithm, leading to an overall complexity of $O(n)$.",
