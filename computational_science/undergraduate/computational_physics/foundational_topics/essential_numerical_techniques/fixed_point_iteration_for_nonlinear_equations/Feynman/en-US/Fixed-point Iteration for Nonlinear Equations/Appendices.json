The concept of convergence order (linear, quadratic, etc.) is a standard topic in computational science and engineering. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear objective and sufficient information. The condition of \"at least quadratic order\" imposes a specific mathematical constraint on the iteration function's derivative, which allows for the unique determination of each parameter $\\alpha_{k}$. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a standard, formalizable problem in numerical analysis.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the analysis of the convergence rate of a fixed-point iteration $x_{n+1} = g(x_{n})$. A fixed-point iteration converges to a root $r$ if $r$ is a fixed point of $g(x)$, i.e., $g(r) = r$, and if the iteration function is a contraction mapping in a neighborhood of $r$. The order of convergence is determined by the derivatives of $g(x)$ evaluated at the fixed point $r$.\n\nFor an iteration to be locally of at least quadratic order, the first derivative of the iteration function must be zero at the fixed point. That is, $g'(r) = 0$. If this condition is met, the Taylor series expansion of $g(x)$ about $r$ is:\n$$\ng(x) = g(r) + g'(r)(x-r) + \\frac{g''(r)}{2!}(x-r)^{2} + O((x-r)^{3})\n$$\nWith $g(r)=r$ and $g'(r)=0$, this becomes:\n$$\ng(x) - r = \\frac{g''(r)}{2}(x-r)^{2} + O((x-r)^{3})\n$$\nLet $e_{n} = x_{n} - r$ be the error at iteration $n$. Then $x_{n} = r + e_{n}$, and $x_{n+1} = g(x_{n})$.\n$$\ne_{n+1} = x_{n+1} - r = g(x_{n}) - r = g(r + e_{n}) - r = \\frac{g''(r)}{2} e_{n}^{2} + O(e_{n}^{3})\n$$\nThis relationship, where the error at step $n+1$ is proportional to the square of the error at step $n$, is the definition of quadratic convergence, provided that $g''(r) \\neq 0$. The condition \"at least quadratic\" requires $g'(r)=0$.\n\nFor each root $r_k$, the iteration function is $g_{k}(x) = x - \\alpha_{k} f(x)$. First, we confirm that each root $r_k$ is a fixed point of $g_k(x)$. By definition, $f(r_k) = 0$, so $g_{k}(r_{k}) = r_{k} - \\alpha_{k} f(r_{k}) = r_{k} - \\alpha_{k}(0) = r_{k}$. This is satisfied for any choice of $\\alpha_k$.\n\nTo ensure at least quadratic convergence, we must enforce the condition $g_{k}'(r_{k}) = 0$. We first compute the derivative of $g_{k}(x)$:\n$$\ng_{k}'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x - \\alpha_{k} f(x) \\right) = 1 - \\alpha_{k} f'(x)\n$$\nEvaluating this at the root $r_{k}$ and setting it to zero yields:\n$$\ng_{k}'(r_{k}) = 1 - \\alpha_{k} f'(r_{k}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha_{k}$, we find that the required value is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{k} = \\frac{1}{f'(r_{k})}\n$$\nThis assumes $f'(r_k) \\neq 0$, which is true for a simple root, as stated in the problem.\n\nNext, we must compute the derivative of the given function $f(x) = x^{3} - 6x^{2} + 11x - 6$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x^{3} - 6x^{2} + 11x - 6 \\right) = 3x^{2} - 12x + 11\n$$\nNow we can compute the value of $\\alpha_{k}$ for each of the three roots.\n\nFor the root $r_{1} = 1$:\n$$\nf'(1) = 3(1)^{2} - 12(1) + 11 = 3 - 12 + 11 = 2\n$$\nThus, the parameter $\\alpha_{1}$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{1} = \\frac{1}{f'(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nFor the root $r_{2} = 2$:\n$$\nf'(2) = 3(2)^{2} - 12(2) + 11 = 3(4) - 24 + 11 = 12 - 24 + 11 = -1\n$$\nThus, the parameter $\\alpha_{2}$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{2} = \\frac{1}{f'(2)} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1\n$$\n\nFor the root $r_{3} = 3$:\n$$\nf'(3) = 3(3)^{2} - 12(3) + 11 = 3(9) - 36 + 11 = 27 - 36 + 11 = 2\n$$\nThus, the parameter $\\alpha_{3}$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{3} = \\frac{1}{f'(3)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the computation of the sum $S = \\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{3}$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{1}{2} + (-1) + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nThe value of $S$ is exactly $0$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction and application of a fixed-point iteration scheme, $x_{n+1} = g(x_n)$, with a third-order (cubic) rate of convergence for finding a simple root $\\alpha$ of a nonlinear equation $f(x)=0$. A simple root is defined by the conditions $f(\\alpha)=0$ and $f'(\\alpha) \\neq 0$.\n\nFirst, we must derive the iteration function $g(x)$. The order of convergence of a fixed-point method is determined by the derivatives of the iteration function $g(x)$ at the fixed point $\\alpha$. For cubic convergence, we require that $g(\\alpha)=\\alpha$, and its first two derivatives vanish at the root, while the third does not:\n$$g'(\\alpha) = 0$$\n$$g''(\\alpha) = 0$$\n$$g'''(\\alpha) \\neq 0$$\n\nA well-known family of high-order root-finding methods is Householder's methods. The method for third-order convergence is commonly known as Halley's method. We can derive its formula by considering the Taylor series expansion of $f(x)$ around the current iterate $x_n$, and retaining terms up to the second order to approximate the correction step $\\delta = \\alpha - x_n$.\nThe root $\\alpha$ satisfies $f(\\alpha)=0$. Expanding $f$ around $x_n$:\n$$f(\\alpha) = 0 \\approx f(x_n) + f'(x_n)(\\alpha - x_n) + \\frac{f''(x_n)}{2}(\\alpha - x_n)^2$$\nLet $\\delta = \\alpha - x_n$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $\\delta$:\n$$f(x_n) + f'(x_n)\\delta + \\frac{f''(x_n)}{2}\\delta^2 \\approx 0$$\nTo obtain a refined approximation for $\\delta$, we can substitute the first-order approximation from Newton's method, $\\delta \\approx -f(x_n)/f'(x_n)$, into the second-order term:\n$$f(x_n) + f'(x_n)\\delta + \\frac{f''(x_n)}{2} \\left( -\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\right)^2 \\approx 0$$\nSolving for $\\delta$:\n$$f'(x_n)\\delta \\approx -f(x_n) - \\frac{f''(x_n) [f(x_n)]^2}{2 [f'(x_n)]^2}$$\n$$\\delta \\approx -\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} - \\frac{f''(x_n) [f(x_n)]^2}{2 [f'(x_n)]^3}$$\nThis yields an iterative formula. However, a more common and numerically stable form, Halley's method, is derived by rewriting the Taylor expansion as an approximation for $\\delta$:\n$$f'(x_n)\\delta \\approx -f(x_n) - \\frac{f''(x_n)}{2}\\delta^2$$\nDividing by $f'(x_n)$ gives $\\delta \\approx -\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} - \\frac{f''(x_n)}{2f'(x_n)}\\delta^2$. This is an implicit equation for $\\delta$. An iterative approach to this equation is to start with $\\delta_0=0$ and compute $\\delta_1 = -f(x_n)/f'(x_n)$, which is Newton's step. Then $\\delta_2 = \\frac{-f(x_n)}{f'(x_n) - \\frac{f''(x_n)}{2}\\delta_1}$. This is one of a few ways to motivate the structure.\n\nThe standard form of Halley's iteration is:\n$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{2 f(x_n) f'(x_n)}{2 [f'(x_n)]^2 - f(x_n) f''(x_n)}$$\nThis defines the iteration function $g(x)$:\n$$g(x) = x - \\frac{2 f(x) f'(x)}{2 [f'(x)]^2 - f(x) f''(x)}$$\nIt can be formally proven through Taylor expansion of the error term $\\epsilon_{n+1} = x_{n+1} - \\alpha$ that this method satisfies $\\epsilon_{n+1} \\propto \\epsilon_n^3$, confirming its cubic convergence for simple roots, provided $f$ is sufficiently smooth (at least $C^3$).\n\nThe algorithm for finding the root of each function is as follows:\n1.  Initialize the iteration with $n=0$ and the given starting value $x_0$.\n2.  For $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ up to a maximum of $49$ iterations:\n    a. Let the current iterate be $x_n$.\n    b. Calculate $f(x_n)$, $f'(x_n)$, and $f''(x_n)$.\n    c. Check the first termination criterion: if $|f(x_n)| \\leq 10^{-12}$, the iteration is successful. The result is $x_n$. Terminate.\n    d. Calculate the denominator of the correction term: $D_n = 2 [f'(x_n)]^2 - f(x_n) f''(x_n)$. If $D_n$ is close to zero, the method may fail; however, the problem's assumptions preclude this near a simple root.\n    e. Calculate the next iterate: $x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{2 f(x_n) f'(x_n)}{D_n}$.\n    f. Check the second termination criterion: if $|x_{n+1} - x_n| \\leq 10^{-12}$, the iteration is successful. The result is $x_{n+1}$. Terminate.\n    g. Update for the next iteration by setting $x_n \\leftarrow x_{n+1}$.\n3.  If the loop completes after $50$ iterations ($n=49$ is the last step calculating $x_{50}$) without meeting either termination criterion, the process stops. The result is the last computed iterate, $x_{50}$.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three test cases specified in the problem statement. The final numerical results are rounded to $10$ decimal places as required.",

We are given a family of fixed-point mappings,\n$$\ng_{\\lambda}(x) = x - \\lambda(e^x - 2)\n$$\nThe iterative sequence is defined by $x_{n+1} = g_{\\lambda}(x_n)$ for $n \\ge 0$. A fixed point $x^\\star$ of this mapping satisfies $x^\\star = g_{\\lambda}(x^\\star)$, which implies $x^\\star = x^\\star - \\lambda(e^{x^\\star} - 2)$, and thus $e^{x^\\star} - 2 = 0$. The fixed points of $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ are indeed the roots of $f(x)$, provided $\\lambda \\neq 0$.\n\nFor the iteration to converge to a fixed point $x^\\star$, the mapping $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ must be a contraction in a neighborhood of $x^\\star$. The condition for convergence is given by the Contraction Mapping Theorem, which requires $|g'_{\\lambda}(x^\\star)|  1$. The derivative of $g_{\\lambda}(x)$ is:\n$$\ng'_{\\lambda}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x - \\lambda(e^x - 2) \\right) = 1 - \\lambda e^x\n$$\nEvaluating this derivative at the fixed point $x^\\star = \\ln(2)$:\n$$\ng'_{\\lambda}(x^\\star) = 1 - \\lambda e^{\\ln(2)} = 1 - 2\\lambda\n$$\nThe convergence condition is therefore $|1 - 2\\lambda|  1$. This inequality is equivalent to $-1  1 - 2\\lambda  1$, which simplifies to $-2  -2\\lambda  0$. Dividing by $-2$ and reversing the inequalities gives $0  \\lambda  1$. All test cases provided use $\\lambda$ values within this range, ensuring convergence.\n\nWhen $g'_{\\lambda}(x^\\star) \\neq 0$, the convergence is linear. The error at step $n+1$, denoted $e_{n+1} = x_{n+1} - x^\\star$, is related to the error at step $n$, $e_n = x_n - x^\\star$, by a Taylor expansion of $g_{\\lambda}(x_n)$ around $x^\\star$:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = g_{\\lambda}(x_n) \\approx g_{\\lambda}(x^\\star) + g'_{\\lambda}(x^\\star)(x_n - x^\\star)\n$$\n$$\nx_{n+1} - x^\\star \\approx g'_{\\lambda}(x^\\star)(x_n - x^\\star) \\implies e_{n+1} \\approx r \\cdot e_n\n$$\nwhere $r = g'_{\\lambda}(x^\\star) = 1 - 2\\lambda$ is the asymptotic rate of convergence. This relation implies that for large $n$, the error behaves geometrically: $e_n \\approx C r^n$ for some constant $C$. This justifies the geometric error model used as the foundation for Aitken's $\\Delta^2$ method.\n\nWe now derive the Aitken's $\\Delta^2$ acceleration formula. Let $\\{s_n\\}$ be a sequence that converges to a limit $s$. We model the sequence for large $n$ as:\n$$\ns_n = s + C r^n, \\quad |r|1\n$$\nWe write this for three consecutive terms, $s_n$, $s_{n+1}$, and $s_{n+2}$:\n$$\ns_n - s = C r^n \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\ns_{n+1} - s = C r^{n+1} \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\ns_{n+2} - s = C r^{n+2} \\quad (3)\n$$\nOur goal is to eliminate the unknown parameters $C$ and $r$ to find an improved estimate for $s$. We introduce the forward difference operator $\\Delta s_k = s_{k+1} - s_k$.\n$$\n\\Delta s_n = s_{n+1} - s_n = (s_{n+1} - s) - (s_n - s) = C r^{n+1} - C r^n = C r^n (r - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta s_{n+1} = s_{n+2} - s_{n+1} = (s_{n+2} - s) - (s_{n+1} - s) = C r^{n+2} - C r^{n+1} = C r^{n+1} (r - 1)\n$$\nTaking the ratio of these differences eliminates $C$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta s_{n+1}}{\\Delta s_n} = \\frac{C r^{n+1} (r - 1)}{C r^n (r - 1)} = r\n$$\nThis provides an estimate for the convergence rate $r$. Now, from equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we have $s_{n+1} - s = r(s_n - s)$. Substituting our expression for $r$:\n$$\ns_{n+1} - s = \\left(\\frac{s_{n+2} - s_{n+1}}{s_{n+1} - s_n}\\right) (s_n - s)\n$$\nThis is an equation for the unknown limit $s$. We solve for $s$:\n$$\n(s_{n+1} - s)(s_{n+1} - s_n) = (s_{n+2} - s_{n+1})(s_n - s)\n$$\n$$\ns_{n+1}(s_{n+1} - s_n) - s(s_{n+1} - s_n) = s_n(s_{n+2} - s_{n+1}) - s(s_{n+2} - s_{n+1})\n$$\n$$\ns \\left( (s_{n+2} - s_{n+1}) - (s_{n+1} - s_n) \\right) = s_n(s_{n+2} - s_{n+1}) - s_{n+1}(s_{n+1} - s_n)\n$$\n$$\ns (s_{n+2} - 2s_{n+1} + s_n) = s_n s_{n+2} - s_n s_{n+1} - s_{n+1}^2 + s_n s_{n+1} = s_n s_{n+2} - s_{n+1}^2\n$$\nProvided the denominator is non-zero, the accelerated estimate for $s$ is:\n$$\ns = \\frac{s_n s_{n+2} - s_{n+1}^2}{s_{n+2} - 2s_{n+1} + s_n}\n$$\nThis formula is susceptible to subtractive cancellation if $s_n$ is large. A more numerically robust form is obtained by rewriting it as:\n$$\ns = s_n - \\frac{(s_{n+1} - s_n)^2}{s_{n+2} - 2s_{n+1} + s_n} = s_n - \\frac{(\\Delta s_n)^2}{\\Delta^2 s_n}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta^2 s_n = \\Delta(\\Delta s_n) = \\Delta s_{n+1} - \\Delta s_n$ is the second-order forward difference. This is the Aitken's $\\Delta^2$ formula. We apply this to the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ by setting $s_k = x_k$. The accelerated estimate, which we denote $x'_{N}$, is formed from the iterates $x_N$, $x_{N+1}$, and $x_{N+2}$:\n$$\nx'_{N} = x_N - \\frac{(x_{N+1} - x_N)^2}{x_{N+2} - 2x_{N+1} + x_N}\n$$\nThis expression is well-defined if and only if the denominator $x_{N+2} - 2x_{N+1} + x_N \\neq 0$. In floating-point arithmetic, we must check if the absolute value of the denominator is smaller than some tolerance $\\tau > 0$, such as $\\tau = 10^{-14}$. If $|x_{N+2} - 2x_{N+1} + x_N|  \\tau$, the transformation is numerically unstable or ill-defined, and we shall return the latest unaccelerated iterate, $x_{N+2}$, as the result.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\nFor each given test case $(\\lambda, x_0, N)$:\n1. Set the fixed reference value $x^\\star = \\ln(2)$.\n2. Initialize a sequence of iterates with $x_0$.\n3. Generate $N+2$ subsequent iterates, $x_1, \\dots, x_{N+2}$, using the mapping $x_{n+1} = x_n - \\lambda(e^{x_n} - 2)$. Store all iterates up to $x_{N+2}$.\n4. Calculate the unaccelerated absolute error: $E_{\\mathrm{plain}} = |x_{N+2} - x^\\star|$.\n5. Retrieve the last three iterates required for acceleration: $x_N, x_{N+1}, x_{N+2}$.\n6. Calculate the denominator of the Aitken formula: $d = x_{N+2} - 2x_{N+1} + x_N$.\n7. If $|d|  10^{-14}$, set the accelerated estimate $x_{\\mathrm{acc}} = x_{N+2}$.\n8. Otherwise, calculate the accelerated estimate $x_{\\mathrm{acc}} = x_N - (x_{N+1} - x_N)^2 / d$.\n9. Calculate the accelerated absolute error: $E_{\\mathrm{acc}} = |x_{\\mathrm{acc}} - x^\\star|$.\n10. Round both error values, $E_{\\mathrm{plain}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{acc}}$, to $12$ decimal digits and store them.\nFinally, all computed error values from all test cases are compiled into a single flat list and printed in the specified format.",
