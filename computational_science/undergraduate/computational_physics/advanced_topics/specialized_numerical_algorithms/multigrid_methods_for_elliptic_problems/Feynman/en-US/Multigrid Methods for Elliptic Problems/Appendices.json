            "solution": "The posed problem is the numerical solution of the three-dimensional Poisson equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi = f$, on a periodic cubic domain. The problem is well-defined, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in computational physics, and we shall proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe most efficient method for solving a linear partial differential equation with constant coefficients on a periodic domain is the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The periodic boundary conditions and the structure of the Laplacian operator mean that the discrete Fourier modes (complex exponentials) are the exact eigenfunctions of the discrete Laplacian operator. This property allows for the transformation of the system of coupled linear algebraic equations in real space into a set of independent algebraic equations in Fourier space, which can be solved trivially.\n\nThe problem is to solve the discrete Poisson equation $L_h \\phi_h = f_h$ on a uniform Cartesian grid of size $N \\times N \\times N$. The grid spacing is $h=1/N$. The discrete field $\\phi_h$ is represented by the values $\\phi_{i,j,k}$ at grid points $(x_i, y_j, z_k) = (i/N, j/N, k/N)$ for integers $i,j,k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The $7$-point discrete Laplacian operator, $L_h$, is given by:\n$$\n(L_h \\phi)_{i,j,k} = \\frac{1}{h^2}\\Big(\\phi_{i+1,j,k}+\\phi_{i-1,j,k}+\\phi_{i,j+1,k}+\\phi_{i,j-1,k}+\\phi_{i,j,k+1}+\\phi_{i,j,k-1}-6\\phi_{i,j,k}\\Big)\n$$\nwhere indices are taken modulo $N$ to enforce periodicity.\n\nWe apply the three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the equation $L_h \\phi_h = f_h$. The DFT transforms a real-space grid function $\\psi_{i,j,k}$ into its Fourier-space representation $\\hat{\\psi}_{p,q,r}$, where $(p,q,r)$ are the integer frequency indices. The action of the convolution operator $L_h$ in real space becomes a simple multiplication in Fourier space:\n$$\n\\hat{L}_{p,q,r} \\hat{\\phi}_{p,q,r} = \\hat{f}_{p,q,r}\n$$\nHere, $\\hat{L}_{p,q,r}$ are the eigenvalues of the operator $L_h$, corresponding to the discrete Fourier mode with frequency vector $(p,q,r)$. These eigenvalues can be found by applying $L_h$ to an eigenfunction $\\exp(2\\pi i (pi/N + qj/N + rk/N))$, which yields:\n$$\n\\hat{L}_{p,q,r} = \\frac{1}{h^2} \\left( e^{2\\pi i p/N} + e^{-2\\pi i p/N} + e^{2\\pi i q/N} + e^{-2\\pi i q/N} + e^{2\\pi i r/N} + e^{-2\\pi i r/N} - 6 \\right)\n$$\nUsing the relation $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, the eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\hat{L}_{p,q,r} = \\frac{2}{h^2} \\left[ \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi p}{N}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi q}{N}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{N}\\right) - 3 \\right]\n$$\nThe solution for the Fourier coefficients of the potential $\\phi_h$ is then found by division:\n$$\n\\hat{\\phi}_{p,q,r} = \\frac{\\hat{f}_{p,q,r}}{\\hat{L}_{p,q,r}}\n$$\nThis procedure encounters a singularity for the zero-frequency mode, where $(p,q,r) = (0,0,0)$. For this mode, $\\hat{L}_{0,0,0} = \\frac{2}{h^2} (\\cos(0) + \\cos(0) + \\cos(0) - 3) = 0$. Division by zero is undefined. This is a manifestation of the fact that the Poisson equation on a fully periodic domain is solvable only if a compatibility condition is met by the source term $f_h$. The discrete compatibility condition is that the sum of the source over the grid must be zero: $\\sum_{i,j,k} f_{i,j,k} = 0$. In Fourier space, this corresponds to the zero-frequency component being zero: $\\hat{f}_{0,0,0} = 0$. The problem statement correctly mandates this condition be enforced by numerically subtracting the average of the discrete source term $f_h$.\n\nWith $\\hat{f}_{0,0,0} = 0$, the equation for the zero mode becomes $0 \\cdot \\hat{\\phi}_{0,0,0} = 0$, which means $\\hat{\\phi}_{0,0,0}$ is undetermined. This corresponds to the freedom to add an arbitrary constant to the potential $\\phi$. The problem resolves this ambiguity by imposing a gauge condition: the spatial average of $\\phi$ must be zero. For the discrete solution $\\phi_h$, this means $\\sum_{i,j,k} \\phi_{i,j,k} = 0$, which is equivalent to setting its zero-frequency component to zero: $\\hat{\\phi}_{0,0,0} = 0$.\n\nThe complete algorithm is as follows:\n1. For a given grid size $N$ and source function $f(x,y,z)$, create the discrete source field $f_h$ by evaluating $f$ at the grid points $(x_i, y_j, z_k)$.\n2. Enforce the compatibility condition by subtracting the mean value from $f_h$: $f_h \\leftarrow f_h - \\frac{1}{N^3} \\sum_{i,j,k} f_{i,j,k}$.\n3. Compute the 3D FFT of the modified $f_h$ to obtain $\\hat{f}_{p,q,r}$.\n4. Construct the 3D array of eigenvalues $\\hat{L}_{p,q,r}$.\n5. Compute the Fourier coefficients of the solution $\\hat{\\phi}_{p,q,r} = \\hat{f}_{p,q,r} / \\hat{L}_{p,q,r}$ for all non-zero frequencies $(p,q,r) \\neq (0,0,0)$.\n6. Set the zero-frequency component of the solution to zero, $\\hat{\\phi}_{0,0,0} = 0$, to satisfy the gauge condition.\n7. Compute the 3D inverse FFT of $\\hat{\\phi}_{p,q,r}$ to obtain the solution $\\phi_h$ in real space. Since the source term is real and the operator is symmetric, the solution $\\phi_h$ must be real. We take the real part of the IFFT result to discard negligible imaginary components arising from floating-point arithmetic errors.\n8. Finally, for each test case, calculate the specified scalar quantity ($E_1, E_2, E_3$) using the computed numerical solution $\\phi_h$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for the three test cases provided. For cases $1$ and $2$, we compute the root-mean-square (RMS) error relative to the provided analytical solution. For case $3$, with a zero source, the exact solution is zero, and we report the RMS magnitude of the computed numerical solution, which should be close to floating-point precision.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a valid and well-posed task in computational physics. It asks for the implementation of a geometric multigrid V-cycle solver for the linear system $Au = f$ arising from the finite difference discretization of the two-dimensional Poisson equation, $-\\Delta u = f$, on a unit square with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and all parameters and algorithms are specified with sufficient precision for a unique implementation.\n\nThe core principle of a multigrid method is to accelerate the convergence of a basic iterative solver (the \"smoother\") by solving for the error on a hierarchy of coarser grids. High-frequency components of the error are efficiently damped by the smoother on a fine grid, while low-frequency components are resolved on coarser grids where they appear as high-frequency and can be damped effectively. A V-cycle is a specific recursive algorithm that traverses this grid hierarchy.\n\nThe solution is structured as follows: First, we define the components of the multigrid algorithm—the discrete operator, the smoother, and the grid transfer operators (restriction and prolongation). Then, we combine these into the recursive V-cycle procedure.\n\n**1. Discretization and Operators**\n\nThe continuous problem is discretized on a uniform grid with $N \\times N$ interior points and mesh size $h = 1/(N+1)$. The solution $u$ and right-hand side $f$ are represented as $N \\times N$ arrays. The discrete negative Laplacian operator, $A$, is given by the $5$-point stencil:\n$$\n(Au)_{i,j} = \\frac{4u_{i,j} - u_{i-1,j} - u_{i+1,j} - u_{i,j-1} - u_{i,j+1}}{h^2}\n$$\nfor interior indices $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced by setting $u_{i,j} = 0$ for any index pair $(i,j)$ outside this interior range.\n\n**2. Weighted Jacobi Smoother**\n\nThe smoother's role is to reduce high-frequency error. We use the weighted Jacobi method. The update for a single smoothing step is:\n$$\nu \\leftarrow u + \\omega D^{-1}(f - Au)\n$$\nHere, $r = f - Au$ is the residual. The matrix $D$ is the diagonal of $A$, which has a constant value $D_{i,j} = 4/h^2$ for all interior points. Thus, its inverse is a scalar multiplication: $D^{-1} = (h^2/4)I$. The weight $\\omega = 2/3$ is chosen for good smoothing properties for this specific operator. We perform $\\nu_1 = 3$ pre-smoothing steps before coarsening and $\\nu_2 = 3$ post-smoothing steps after correction from the coarse grid.\n\n**3. Grid Transfer Operators**\n\nGrid transfer operators move data between fine and coarse grids. The grid hierarchy is defined by the standard coarsening rule for grids of size $N = 2^\\ell - 1$, where a fine grid of size $N_{\\text{fine}}$ is mapped to a coarse grid of size $N_{\\text{coarse}} = (N_{\\text{fine}} - 1)/2$.\n\n**Restriction ($R$):** The fine-grid residual $r^{\\text{fine}}$ is transferred to the coarse grid to form the right-hand side of the coarse-grid error equation, $r^{\\text{coarse}} = R r^{\\text{fine}}$. We use full-weighting restriction, where a coarse-grid value is a weighted average of $9$ corresponding fine-grid values. The stencil for the coarse-grid point $(I,J)$ centered at fine-grid point $(2I+1, 2J+1)$ is:\n$$\nr^{\\text{coarse}}_{I,J} = \\frac{1}{16} \\sum_{i,j \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}} w_{i,j} r^{\\text{fine}}_{2I+1+i, 2J+1+j}, \\quad \\text{with weights } W = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Prolongation ($P$):** After solving the error equation on the coarse grid, the resulting error correction $e^{\\text{coarse}}$ must be interpolated back to the fine grid: $e^{\\text{fine}} = P e^{\\text{coarse}}$. We use bilinear interpolation. A coarse-grid value $e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I,J}$ is used to determine values at a $2 \\times 2$ block of fine-grid points.\n- Fine-grid points coinciding with coarse-grid points are copied directly: $e^{\\text{fine}}_{2I+1, 2J+1} = e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I,J}$.\n- Fine-grid points along horizontal edges are averages of two coarse-grid neighbors: $e^{\\text{fine}}_{2I+1, 2J} = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I,J} + e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I,J-1})$.\n- Fine-grid points along vertical edges are averages of two coarse-grid neighbors: $e^{\\text{fine}}_{2I, 2J+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I,J} + e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I-1,J})$.\n- Fine-grid points at nexus locations are averages of four coarse-grid neighbors: $e^{\\text{fine}}_{2I, 2J} = \\frac{1}{4}(e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I,J} + e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I-1,J} + e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I,J-1} + e^{\\text{coarse}}_{I-1,J-1})$.\nBoundary conditions are handled by assuming values outside the coarse grid are zero.\n\n**4. The V-Cycle Algorithm**\n\nA single V-cycle for solving $A^k u^k = f^k$ on grid level $k$ is defined recursively:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** If the grid is the coarsest (here, $N_k \\le 3$), solve the system $A^k u^k = f^k$ directly. This involves constructing the small, dense matrix $A^k$ and using a standard linear solver like LU decomposition.\n2.  **Recursive Step (for finer grids):**\n    a. **Pre-smoothing:** Apply $\\nu_1 = 3$ steps of the weighted Jacobi smoother to the current approximation of $u^k$.\n    $$\n    u^k \\leftarrow \\text{Smooth}^{\\nu_1}(A^k, f^k, u^k)\n    $$\n    b. **Compute Residual:** Calculate the residual on the fine grid: $r^k = f^k - A^k u^k$.\n    c. **Restriction:** Transfer the residual to the next coarser level, $k+1$.\n    $$\n    r^{k+1} = R r^k\n    $$\n    d. **Coarse-Grid Solve:** Solve the residual equation on the coarse grid, $A^{k+1} e^{k+1} = r^{k+1}$, for the error correction $e^{k+1}$. This is done by a recursive call to the V-cycle algorithm, starting with a zero initial guess for the error.\n    $$\n    e^{k+1} = \\text{V-cycle}(A^{k+1}, r^{k+1}, \\text{initial guess } 0)\n    $$\n    e. **Prolongation:** Interpolate the computed error correction back to the fine grid.\n    $$\n    e^k = P e^{k+1}\n    $$\n    f. **Correction:** Update the fine-grid solution.\n    $$\n    u^k \\leftarrow u^k + e^k\n    $$\n    g. **Post-smoothing:** Apply $\\nu_2 = 3$ steps of the weighted Jacobi smoother to the corrected solution.\n    $$\n    u^k \\leftarrow \\text{Smooth}^{\\nu_2}(A^k, f^k, u^k)\n    $$\nThe V-cycle process is initiated with a zero initial guess, $u=0$, and is iterated until the relative residual $\\rho = \\lVert f-Au \\rVert_2 / \\lVert f \\rVert_2$ falls below a tolerance $\\epsilon = 10^{-8}$ or a maximum of $K=20$ cycles is reached.

Within a multigrid V-cycle, a red-black Gauss–Seidel smoother is applied on each grid level. Let the finest-level interior grid have $n_0 \\times n_0$ points, with coarsening by a factor of $2$ in each spatial direction so that level $\\ell$ has $n_\\ell = \\max\\!\\left(2, \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{n_0}{2^\\ell} \\right\\rfloor \\right)$ interior points per dimension and $N_\\ell = n_\\ell^2$ interior points in total. Assume that smoothing is performed on each level with a total of $n_{\\mathrm{sweeps}} = \\nu_1 + \\nu_2$ sweeps per V-cycle.\n\nThe red-black Gauss–Seidel method updates half the points (the red set) followed by the other half (the black set) in each sweep. Assume that one point update costs $w_f$ floating-point operations and transfers $w_m$ bytes to or from main memory. The computation runs on a multi-core central processing unit (CPU) with $p$ identical cores, each capable of a sustained floating-point rate $f_{\\mathrm{core}}$ (in floating-point operations per second), and a shared sustained memory bandwidth $B$ (in bytes per second). A global barrier synchronization has latency $\\tau_b$ (in seconds), and the scheduling/launch overhead per color phase has latency $\\tau_\\ell$ (in seconds).

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is determined to be valid. It presents a well-posed computational task based on a clear, explicit, and scientifically sound performance model for a multigrid smoother, a standard algorithm in computational physics. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute a set of parallel performance metrics for a multigrid V-cycle smoother using a given analytical performance model. The metrics include parallel speedup ($S$), efficiency ($E$), and fractions of total time attributed to barrier synchronization ($F_{\\mathrm{bar}}$), scheduling overhead ($F_{\\mathrm{sched}}$), and insufficient parallelism ($F_{\\mathrm{plim}}$). The calculation will be performed for several test cases, each defined by a finest grid size $n_0$ and a number of processor cores $p$.\n\nThe computational procedure is built by directly implementing the provided formulae. The overall structure of the calculation for a single test case $(n_0, p)$ is as follows:\n\nFirst, we must determine the grid hierarchy. The V-cycle operates on a sequence of grids, starting from the finest level $\\ell=0$ with $n_0 \\times n_0$ interior points. Each subsequent level $\\ell+1$ is obtained by coarsening the grid on level $\\ell$ by a factor of $2$. The number of interior points per dimension on level $\\ell$ is given by $n_\\ell = \\max\\!\\left(2, \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{n_0}{2^\\ell} \\right\\rfloor \\right)$. The V-cycle proceeds until the grid size no longer decreases, which occurs when $n_\\ell=2$. We generate the sequence of grid sizes $\\{n_\\ell\\}$ for $\\ell = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ until this condition is met.\n\nSecond, for each level $\\ell$ in the hierarchy and a given number of cores $p$, we calculate the total time for one smoothing sweep, $T_\\ell(p)$. This involves several steps:\n1.  Calculate the total number of interior points: $N_\\ell = n_\\ell^2$.\n2.  Determine the effective per-color concurrency: $c_\\ell(p) = \\min\\!\\left(p, \\frac{N_\\ell}{2}\\right)$. This reflects that a red-black smoother processes $\\frac{N_\\ell}{2}$ points in parallel during each of its two phases.\n3.  Calculate the compute-limited time for one sweep: $T^{(\\mathrm{comp})}_\\ell(p) = \\frac{N_\\ell \\, w_f}{f_{\\mathrm{core}} \\, c_\\ell(p)}$. This models the time assuming performance is limited by the floating-point capability of the available cores.\n4.  Calculate the memory-limited time for one sweep: $T^{(\\mathrm{mem})}_\\ell = \\frac{N_\\ell \\, w_m}{B}$. This models the time assuming performance is limited by memory bandwidth.\n5.  The base time for one sweep is the maximum of these two: $T^{(\\mathrm{base})}_\\ell(p) = \\max\\!\\left( T^{(\\mathrm{comp})}_\\ell(p), \\, T^{(\\mathrm{mem})}_\\ell \\right)$. This is a standard roofline model assumption.\n6.  Calculate the parallel overheads for one sweep. Since each sweep consists of two phases (red and black), a barrier and scheduling event may occur for each. The total overheads are $T^{(\\mathrm{bar})}(p) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{p>1\\}} \\cdot 2 \\, \\tau_b$ and $T^{(\\mathrm{sched})}(p) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{p>1\\}} \\cdot 2 \\, \\tau_\\ell$, where $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{p>1\\}}$ is the indicator function, equal to $1$ if $p>1$ and $0$ if $p=1$.\n7.  The total time for one sweep on level $\\ell$ is the sum of the base time and overheads: $T_\\ell(p) = T^{(\\mathrm{base})}_\\ell(p) + T^{(\\mathrm{bar})}(p) + T^{(\\mathrm{sched})}(p)$.\n\nThird, we calculate the total smoother time over one complete V-cycle, $T_{\\mathrm{total}}(p)$. This is the sum of the sweep times over all levels, multiplied by the number of sweeps per level, $n_{\\mathrm{sweeps}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{total}}(p) = n_{\\mathrm{sweeps}} \\sum_{\\ell} T_\\ell(p)\n$$\n\nFourth, we calculate the total time lost due to insufficient parallelism. For each level $\\ell$, this loss, $L_\\ell(p)$, occurs only if the sweep is compute-limited ($T^{(\\mathrm{comp})}_\\ell(p) \\ge T^{(\\mathrm{mem})}_\\ell$) and there are fewer independent tasks than cores ($c_\\ell(p) < p$). The loss is the difference between the actual compute time and the ideal time if all $p$ cores could have been used:\n$$\nL_\\ell(p) = \n\\begin{cases}\nT^{(\\mathrm{comp})}_\\ell(p) - \\frac{N_\\ell \\, w_f}{f_{\\mathrm{core}} \\, p}, & \\text{if } T^{(\\mathrm{comp})}_\\ell(p) \\ge T^{(\\mathrm{mem})}_\\ell, \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total parallelism-limit loss over the V-cycle is $L_{\\mathrm{total}}(p) = n_{\\mathrm{sweeps}} \\sum_{\\ell} L_\\ell(p)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the required performance metrics.\n1.  To find the speedup $S$, we need the serial execution time $T_{\\mathrm{total}}(1)$. This is calculated by applying the entire procedure above with $p=1$. The speedup is then $S = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{total}}(1)}{T_{\\mathrm{total}}(p)}$.\n2.  The efficiency is $E = \\frac{S}{p}$.\n3.  The overhead fractions are calculated by summing the respective overhead components across all levels, multiplying by $n_{\\mathrm{sweeps}}$, and normalizing by the total time $T_{\\mathrm{total}}(p)$:\n    $F_{\\mathrm{bar}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{sweeps}} \\sum_{\\ell} T^{(\\mathrm{bar})}(p)}{T_{\\mathrm{total}}(p)}$\n    $F_{\\mathrm{sched}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{sweeps}} \\sum_{\\ell} T^{(\\mathrm{sched})}(p)}{T_{\\mathrm{total}}(p)}$\n    $F_{\\mathrm{plim}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{total}}(p)}{T_{\\mathrm{total}}(p)}$\n\nFor the special case of $p=1$, the overheads $T^{(\\mathrm{bar})}(1)$, $T^{(\\mathrm{sched})}(1)$, and $L_\\ell(1)$ are all zero. Consequently, $S=1$, $E=1$, and all overhead fractions are $0$.\n\nThis complete procedure will be implemented and applied to each test case specified in the problem statement.",
