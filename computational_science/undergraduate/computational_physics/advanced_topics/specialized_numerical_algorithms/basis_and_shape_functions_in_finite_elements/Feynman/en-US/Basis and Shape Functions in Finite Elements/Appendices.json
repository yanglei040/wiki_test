You will derive the interpolation function, $u_h(x)$, which approximates the solution within a single element by blending nodal values using linear basis (or shape) functions. Mastering this simple case is crucial, as it builds the intuition for how complex problems are broken down and solved piece by piece across a mesh .",

These nodes are located at spatial coordinates $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$, respectively. The values of the unknown field variable (e.g., temperature) at these nodes are denoted by $u_i$ and $u_{i+1}$.\n\nWithin this element, for any coordinate $x$ such that $x_i \\le x \\le x_{i+1}$, the field variable is approximated by a linear interpolation function, $u_h(x)$. This function is constructed as a linear combination of basis functions (also called shape functions) and the nodal values.\n\nDetermine the expression for the approximate solution $u_h(x)$ within this element. Your final answer should be expressed in terms of the variable $x$, the nodal coordinates $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$, and the nodal values $u_i$ and $u_{i+1}$.",

The interface is the reference interval $[-1,1] \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, where the coarse side is represented by a single element spanning $[-1,1]$, and the fine side is represented by two elements spanning $[-1,0]$ and $[0,1]$. To ensure a conforming discretization with a hanging node at $x=0$, introduce a three-node transition element on $[-1,1]$ with nodal locations $x=-1$, $x=0$, and $x=1$.\n\nLet the basis (shape) functions be $N_{-1}(x)$, $N_{0}(x)$, and $N_{1}(x)$ associated with the nodes at $x=-1$, $x=0$, and $x=1$, respectively.

The problem states that the basis here must coincide with the standard linear two-node basis on nodes $x=-1$ and $x=0$.\nThe standard linear Lagrangian basis functions on an interval $[x_a, x_b]$ are given by:\n$$L_a(x) = \\frac{x_b - x}{x_b - x_a}, \\quad L_b(x) = \\frac{x - x_a}{x_b - x_a}$$\nFor the interval $[-1,0]$, we have $x_a = -1$ and $x_b = 0$.

This is also explicitly stated as an implication in Requirement 3.\n$N_{1}(x) = 0$\n\nNext, consider the subinterval $[0,1]$. The basis must coincide with the standard linear two-node basis on nodes $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nFor the interval $[0,1]$, we have $x_a = 0$ and $x_b = 1$. The basis functions associated with these nodes are:\n$$L_0(x) = \\frac{1 - x}{1 - 0} = 1-x$$\n$$L_1(x) = \\frac{x - 0}{1 - 0} = x$$\nAccording to Requirement 3, on the interval $[0,1]$, the basis functions $N_i(x)$ are:\n$N_{0}(x) = L_{0}(x) = 1-x$\n$N_{1}(x) = L_{1}(x) = x$\nThe node $x=-1$ is not part of this sub-element, so its corresponding basis function must be zero.\n$N_{-1}(x) = 0$\n\nCombining these results, we obtain the piecewise definitions for the basis functions on the entire interval $[-1,1]$:\n$$N_{-1}(x) = \\begin{cases} -x & \\text{for } x \\in [-1, 0] \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } x \\in [0, 1] \\end{cases}$$\n$$N_{0}(x) = \\begin{cases} x+1 & \\text{for } x \\in [-1, 0] \\\\ 1-x & \\text{for } x \\in [0, 1] \\end{cases}$$\n$$N_{1}(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{for } x \\in [-1, 0] \\\\ x & \\text{for } x \\in [0, 1] \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe problem requires a single closed-form analytic expression for each function. We can achieve this using the absolute value function, $|x|$, which is defined as:\n$$|x| = \\begin{cases} -x & \\text{for } x < 0 \\\\ x & \\text{for } x \\ge 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nFor $N_{0}(x)$:\nOn $[-1,0]$, we have $|x|=-x$, so $1-|x| = 1-(-x) = 1+x$. This matches.\nOn $[0,1]$, we have $|x|=x$, so $1-|x| = 1-x$. This matches.\nThus, the closed-form expression for $N_{0}(x)$ is:\n$$N_{0}(x) = 1 - |x|$$\n\nFor $N_{-1}(x)$:\nConsider the expression $\\frac{1}{2}(-x+|x|)$.\nOn $[-1,0]$, $|x|=-x$, so the expression becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(-x-x) = -x$. This matches.\nOn $[0,1]$, $|x|=x$, so the expression becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(-x+x) = 0$. This matches.\nThus, the closed-form expression for $N_{-1}(x)$ is:\n$$N_{-1}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(-x+|x|)$$\n\nFor $N_{1}(x)$:\nConsider the expression $\\frac{1}{2}(x+|x|)$.\nOn $[-1,0]$, $|x|=-x$, so the expression becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(x-x) = 0$. This matches.\nOn $[0,1]$, $|x|=x$, so the expression becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(x+x) = x$. This matches.\nThus, the closed-form expression for $N_{1}(x)$ is:\n$$N_{1}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x+|x|)$$\n\nWe must verify that these closed-form expressions satisfy all three original requirements.\n\n1. Nodal Interpolation ($N_{i}(x_{j})=\\delta_{ij}$):\nAt $x=-1$:\n$N_{-1}(-1) = \\frac{1}{2}(-(-1)+|-1|) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+1) = 1$\n$N_{0}(-1) = 1 - |-1| = 1 - 1 = 0$\n$N_{1}(-1) = \\frac{1}{2}(-1+|-1|) = \\frac{1}{2}(-1+1) = 0$\nAt $x=0$:\n$N_{-1}(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(-0+|0|) = 0$\n$N_{0}(0) = 1 - |0| = 1$\n$N_{1}(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0+|0|) = 0$\nAt $x=1$:\n$N_{-1}(1) = \\frac{1}{2}(-1+|1|) = \\frac{1}{2}(-1+1) = 0$\n$N_{0}(1) = 1 - |1| = 1 - 1 = 0$\n$N_{1}(1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+|1|) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+1) = 1$\nThe nodal interpolation property is satisfied.\n\n2. Partition of Unity ($\\sum_{i} N_{i}(x) = 1$):\n$$N_{-1}(x)+N_{0}(x)+N_{1}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(-x+|x|) + (1-|x|) + \\frac{1}{2}(x+|x|)$$\n$$= \\left(\\frac{-x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{|x|}{2} - |x| + \\frac{|x|}{2}\\right) + 1$$\n$$= 0 + \\left(|x| - |x|\\right) + 1 = 1$$\nThe partition of unity is satisfied for all $x \\in [-1,1]$.\n\n3. Conformity: The closed-form expressions were constructed precisely to match the piecewise linear functions derived from the conformity requirement.
