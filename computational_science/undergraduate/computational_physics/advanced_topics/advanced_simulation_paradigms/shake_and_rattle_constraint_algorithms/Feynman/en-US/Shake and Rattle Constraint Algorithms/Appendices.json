            "problem": "Consider two point particles of equal mass subject to a single holonomic distance constraint that fixes their separation to a prescribed bond length. Let the positions of the two particles at the end of an unconstrained predictor step be denoted by a relative displacement vector whose squared magnitude is $s = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12} \\rVert^{2}$. The holonomic constraint is $g(\\mathbf{r}) = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12} \\rVert^{2} - L^{2} = 0$, where $L$ is the target bond length. The classical SHAKE (a constraint projection method introduced for Molecular Dynamics by Ryckaert, Ciccotti, and Berendsen) position correction applies a Lagrange-multiplier-based update that, in its iterative linearized form for a single distance constraint and equal masses, can be written as an update on the relative vector $\\mathbf{r}_{12}$ of the form $\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} + \\delta \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)}$ with $\\delta \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)}$ proportional to $\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)}$. If one denotes the current squared-length error by $e_{k} = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^{2} - L^{2}$, the induced one-constraint SHAKE iteration produces a nonlinear recurrence $e_{k+1} = \\Phi(e_{k},L)$, which you must derive from first principles starting from the definition of the constraint, the gradient of the constraint, and the linearized Lagrange-multiplier correction step.\n\nYour task is to investigate how the number of SHAKE iterations required to reduce the squared-length error below a prescribed tolerance depends on the ratio of the timestep to a characteristic bond-period timescale. Use the following modeling assumptions to make the problem self-contained and universally applicable in dimensionless units:\n\n- Assume equal masses and a single distance constraint $g(\\mathbf{r}) = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12} \\rVert^{2} - L^{2} = 0$.\n- Use the iterative, linearized SHAKE position-projection step derived from the holonomic constraint with Lagrange multipliers.\n- Let the initial squared-length error supplied to the SHAKE iteration be modeled as $e_{0} = C L^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{T}\\right)^{2}$, where $\\Delta t$ is the timestep, $T$ is a characteristic bond-period timescale (e.g., a vibrational period), and $C$ is a dimensionless constant arising from the kinematics of the fastest bonded motion. For definiteness, take $C = 4 \\pi^{2}$, which corresponds to the leading-order deviation incurred over one timestep when the unconstrained predictor does not supply the centripetal acceleration of a circular bonded motion with angular frequency $\\omega = \\frac{2 \\pi}{T}$.\n- Work in dimensionless units with $L = 1$, so that all squared-length errors are dimensionless. The tolerance for convergence is a relative squared-length error threshold $\\tau$ applied directly to $e_{k}$, i.e., stop the iteration when $e_{k} \\le \\tau$. Use $\\tau = 10^{-12}$.\n\nStarting from Newton's second law and the definition of a holonomic constraint enforced via Lagrange multipliers, first derive the explicit scalar recurrence $e_{k+1} = \\Phi(e_{k},L)$ for the single-constraint SHAKE iteration under the assumptions above. Then, write a complete, runnable program that, for each test case listed below, computes the minimal nonnegative integer number of iterations $N$ required so that after $N$ SHAKE iterations the squared-length error satisfies $e_{N} \\le \\tau$.\n\nTest suite (each item specifies the ratio $\\Delta t / T$):\n- Case A: $\\Delta t / T = 0$\n- Case B: $\\Delta t / T = \\frac{1}{50}$\n- Case C: $\\Delta t / T = \\frac{1}{20}$\n- Case D: $\\Delta t / T = \\frac{1}{10}$\n- Case E: $\\Delta t / T = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- Case F: $\\Delta t / T = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Case G: $\\Delta t / T = 1$\n\nProgram requirements:\n- Implement the single-constraint iterative SHAKE update on the squared-length error using the derived scalar recurrence $e_{k+1} = \\Phi(e_{k},L)$ with $L = 1$ and $C = 4 \\pi^{2}$.\n- For each test case, initialize $e_{0} = C \\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{T}\\right)^{2}$ and iterate until $e_{k} \\le \\tau$ with $\\tau = 10^{-12}$, counting the minimal number of iterations $N$.\n- The program must output a single line containing the seven integers $N$ for the cases A through G in order, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[n_{A},n_{B},n_{C},n_{D},n_{E},n_{F},n_{G}]$.\n\nThere are no physical units in this formulation; all quantities are dimensionless by construction. Angles (through $\\pi$) are treated in radians. The final outputs are integers.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in computational physics concerning the convergence properties of the SHAKE algorithm. It is complete, consistent, and requires a solution based on established mathematical and physical principles. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to derive from first principles the scalar recurrence relation for the squared-length error in an iterative SHAKE procedure for a simple two-particle system; second, to implement this recurrence numerically to determine the number of iterations required for convergence under various conditions.\n\nLet the positions of the two particles of equal mass, $m_1 = m_2 = m$, be denoted by $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$. The holonomic constraint fixes the distance between them:\n$$g(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = (\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2) \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2) - L^2 = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12} \\rVert^2 - L^2 = 0$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}_{12} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2$ is the relative position vector and $L$ is the prescribed bond length.\n\nThe SHAKE algorithm is an iterative procedure to correct positions that have been updated by an unconstrained integration step, such that they satisfy the constraint equation. Let $\\mathbf{r}_i^{(k)}$ be the position of particle $i$ at iteration $k$ of the correction procedure, with $\\mathbf{r}_i^{(0)}$ being the unconstrained predicted position. The correction at each step, $\\delta \\mathbf{r}_i^{(k)} = \\mathbf{r}_i^{(k+1)} - \\mathbf{r}_i^{(k)}$, is assumed to be proportional to the gradient of the constraint function evaluated at $\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}$. For a single constraint, this is:\n$$\\delta \\mathbf{r}_i^{(k)} = \\frac{\\lambda_k}{m_i} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)})$$\nwhere $\\lambda_k$ is a Lagrange multiplier determined at each iteration.\n\nThe Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda_k$ is found by linearizing the constraint equation around the current positions $\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}$. We require $g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k+1)}) = g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)} + \\delta \\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) = 0$. A first-order Taylor expansion yields:\n$$g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{r}_i^{(k)} \\approx 0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\delta \\mathbf{r}_i^{(k)}$:\n$$g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_k}{m_i} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) \\right) = 0$$\n$$g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) + \\lambda_k \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{1}{m_i} \\lVert \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) \\rVert^2 = 0$$\nSolving for $\\lambda_k$ gives the general expression for the iterative Lagrange multiplier:\n$$\\lambda_k = - \\frac{g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{1}{m_i} \\lVert \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} g(\\mathbf{r}^{(k)}) \\rVert^2}$$\n\nNow, we apply this formalism to our specific system. The gradients of the constraint function $g(\\mathbf{r}_{12}) = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12} \\rVert^2 - L^2$ are:\n$$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_1} g = 2\\mathbf{r}_{12}$$\n$$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_2} g = -2\\mathbf{r}_{12}$$\nThe denominator in the expression for $\\lambda_k$ becomes, using $m_1=m_2=m$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{1}{m_i} \\lVert \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} g(\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)}) \\rVert^2 = \\frac{1}{m} \\lVert 2\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 + \\frac{1}{m} \\lVert -2\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 = \\frac{4}{m} \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 + \\frac{4}{m} \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 = \\frac{8}{m} \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2$$\nThe constraint function itself, evaluated at iteration $k$, is $g(\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)}) = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 - L^2$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\lambda_k$:\n$$\\lambda_k = - \\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 - L^2}{\\frac{8}{m} \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2}$$\n\nThe update rule for the relative position vector $\\mathbf{r}_{12}$ is derived from the individual particle updates:\n$$\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{r}_1^{(k+1)} - \\mathbf{r}_2^{(k+1)} = (\\mathbf{r}_1^{(k)} + \\delta \\mathbf{r}_1^{(k)}) - (\\mathbf{r}_2^{(k)} + \\delta \\mathbf{r}_2^{(k)}) = \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} + (\\delta \\mathbf{r}_1^{(k)} - \\delta \\mathbf{r}_2^{(k)})$$\nUsing the gradient expressions:\n$$\\delta \\mathbf{r}_1^{(k)} - \\delta \\mathbf{r}_2^{(k)} = \\frac{\\lambda_k}{m} (2\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)}) - \\frac{\\lambda_k}{m} (-2\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)}) = \\frac{4\\lambda_k}{m} \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)}$$\nThus, the vector update rule is:\n$$\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} + \\frac{4\\lambda_k}{m} \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\left(1 + \\frac{4\\lambda_k}{m}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\lambda_k$:\n$$\\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\left(1 + \\frac{4}{m} \\left( - \\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 - L^2}{\\frac{8}{m} \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2} \\right) \\right) = \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 - L^2}{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2} \\right)$$\nTo find the recurrence for the squared-length error, $e_k = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 - L^2$, we take the squared norm of the vector update equation:\n$$\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k+1)} \\rVert^2 = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 - L^2}{\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2} \\right)^2$$\nLet us introduce the error definition, $\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k)} \\rVert^2 = e_k + L^2$. The next error is $e_{k+1} = \\lVert \\mathbf{r}_{12}^{(k+1)} \\rVert^2 - L^2$.\n$$e_{k+1} + L^2 = (e_k + L^2) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e_k}{e_k + L^2} \\right)^2$$\nSimplifying the term in parentheses:\n$$1 - \\frac{e_k}{2(e_k + L^2)} = \\frac{2(e_k + L^2) - e_k}{2(e_k + L^2)} = \\frac{e_k + 2L^2}{2(e_k + L^2)}$$\nSubstituting this back yields:\n$$e_{k+1} + L^2 = (e_k + L^2) \\left(\\frac{e_k + 2L^2}{2(e_k + L^2)}\\right)^2 = (e_k + L^2) \\frac{(e_k + 2L^2)^2}{4(e_k + L^2)^2} = \\frac{(e_k + 2L^2)^2}{4(e_k + L^2)}$$\n$$e_{k+1} + L^2 = \\frac{e_k^2 + 4e_k L^2 + 4L^4}{4(e_k + L^2)}$$\nIsolating $e_{k+1}$:\n$$e_{k+1} = \\frac{e_k^2 + 4e_k L^2 + 4L^4}{4(e_k + L^2)} - L^2 = \\frac{e_k^2 + 4e_k L^2 + 4L^4 - 4L^2(e_k + L^2)}{4(e_k + L^2)}$$\n$$e_{k+1} = \\frac{e_k^2 + 4e_k L^2 + 4L^4 - 4e_k L^2 - 4L^4}{4(e_k + L^2)}$$\nThis simplifies to the final recurrence relation for the squared-length error:\n$$e_{k+1} = \\frac{e_k^2}{4(e_k + L^2)}$$\nThis relation demonstrates the quadratic convergence of the SHAKE algorithm for small errors ($e_k \\ll L^2$), where $e_{k+1} \\approx e_k^2 / (4L^2)$.\n\nWith this derived recurrence, we proceed to the numerical computation as specified in the problem statement. We use $L=1$, $C = 4\\pi^2$, and a convergence tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-12}$. The initial error for each test case is $e_0 = C (\\Delta t / T)^2$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in computational physics: simulating a two-body system (diatomic molecule) using two different models for the inter-particle bond. All initial conditions, parameters, and evaluation metrics are clearly defined. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution is provided below.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\n\nThe system consists of two identical masses $m$. With no external forces, the center of mass (CM) velocity is conserved. Given the initial conditions $\\mathbf{r}_1(0)=(-L/2,0)$, $\\mathbf{r}_2(0)=(+L/2,0)$ and $\\mathbf{v}_1(0)=(0,v_0)$, $\\mathbf{v}_2(0)=(0,-v_0)$, the CM is initially at rest at the origin and will remain there for all time $t$. The dynamics can be fully described by the relative coordinate $\\mathbf{r}(t)=\\mathbf{r}_2(t)-\\mathbf{r}_1(t)$. The initial conditions for the relative motion are $\\mathbf{r}(0) = (L, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{v}(0) = (0, -2v_0)$. The initial relative velocity is perpendicular to the bond axis, indicating the system is set into rotation.\n\nThe problem requires simulating this system using two models, for which we select appropriate numerical integration algorithms known for their stability and accuracy in molecular dynamics.\n\n#### Model A: Rigid Bond\n\nIn this model, the bond length is a holonomic constraint: $g(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\|\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1\\| - L = 0$. This constraint must be satisfied at all times. A standard and robust method for integrating equations of motion with holonomic constraints is the **RATTLE** algorithm. RATTLE is a modification of the Velocity Verlet algorithm that incorporates constraint forces through Lagrange multipliers, ensuring that both the position constraints $g=0$ and the velocity constraints $\\dot{g}=0$ are satisfied at each time step.\n\nSince there are no external or potential-derived forces, the algorithm simplifies. A common implementation of RATTLE, based on the leapfrog Verlet scheme, proceeds as follows for each time step $\\Delta t$:\n\n1.  **Unconstrained Position Update**: First, new unconstrained positions $\\mathbf{r}'_i$ are calculated by advancing the old positions $\\mathbf{r}_i(t)$ using the current velocities $\\mathbf{v}_i(t)$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{r}'_i = \\mathbf{r}_i(t) + \\mathbf{v}_i(t) \\Delta t\n    $$\n2.  **SHAKE Correction**: The unconstrained positions $\\mathbf{r}'_i$ will generally violate the bond length constraint. The SHAKE procedure corrects these positions. The correction for each particle is directed along the bond axis. For a two-particle system, this a simple geometric correction. Let $\\mathbf{r}'_{21} = \\mathbf{r}'_2 - \\mathbf{r}'_1$. The corrected positions $\\mathbf{r}_i(t+\\Delta t)$ are:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{r}_1(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{r}'_1 + \\alpha \\mathbf{r}'_{21} \\quad ; \\quad \\mathbf{r}_2(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{r}'_2 - \\alpha \\mathbf{r}'_{21}\n    $$\n    where the correction factor $\\alpha$ is chosen to enforce the constraint:\n    $$\n    \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{L}{\\|\\mathbf{r}'_{21}\\|}\\right)\n    $$\n3.  **Provisional Velocity Update**: Provisional velocities are calculated based on the change between the new corrected positions and the old positions:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{v}'_i = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_i(t+\\Delta t) - \\mathbf{r}_i(t)}{\\Delta t}\n    $$\n4.  **RATTLE Correction**: These provisional velocities must be corrected to satisfy the velocity constraint $\\dot{g} = (\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1)\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}_2-\\mathbf{v}_1) = 0$. The correction removes the component of the relative velocity that is parallel to the bond axis. The final velocities $\\mathbf{v}_i(t+\\Delta t)$ are given by:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{v}_1(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{v}'_1 - \\gamma \\mathbf{r}_{21}(t+\\Delta t) \\quad ; \\quad \\mathbf{v}_2(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{v}'_2 + \\gamma \\mathbf{r}_{21}(t+\\Delta t)\n    $$\n    where $\\mathbf{r}_{21}(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{r}_2(t+\\Delta t) - \\mathbf{r}_1(t+\\Delta t)$, and the factor $\\gamma$ is:\n    $$\n    \\gamma = - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}'_{21} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{21}(t+\\Delta t)}{2 \\|\\mathbf{r}_{21}(t+\\Delta t)\\|^2} = - \\frac{(\\mathbf{v}'_2 - \\mathbf{v}'_1) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{21}(t+\\Delta t)}{2L^2}\n    $$\nThis procedure ensures that the constraints are satisfied while maintaining good energy conservation, which is measured by $\\Delta E$. The root-mean-square deviation $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ will quantify the small numerical errors in satisfying the position constraint.\n\n#### Model B: Stiff Bond\n\nIn this model, the bond is represented by a harmonic potential $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(\\|\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1\\|-L)^2$. This defines a conservative force between the particles:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_1 = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_1} U = k(\\|\\mathbf{r}_{21}\\|-L) \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{21}}{\\|\\mathbf{r}_{21}\\|} \\quad ; \\quad \\mathbf{F}_2 = -\\mathbf{F}_1\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}_{21} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$. This is a standard N-body problem with a defined potential. The **Velocity Verlet** algorithm is an excellent choice for this system. It is a symplectic integrator, which means it has favorable long-term energy conservation properties. The algorithm for one time step $\\Delta t$ is:\n\n1.  **Half-step Velocity Update**: Update velocities from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t/2$ using the forces at time $t$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{v}_i(t+\\Delta t/2) = \\mathbf{v}_i(t) + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_i(t)}{m} \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\n    $$\n2.  **Full-step Position Update**: Update positions from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ using the half-step velocities:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{r}_i(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{r}_i(t) + \\mathbf{v}_i(t+\\Delta t/2) \\Delta t\n    $$\n3.  **Force Calculation**: Compute the new forces $\\mathbf{F}_i(t+\\Delta t)$ using the new positions $\\mathbf{r}_i(t+\\Delta t)$.\n4.  **Second Half-step Velocity Update**: Update velocities from $t+\\Delta t/2$ to $t+\\Delta t$ using the new forces:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{v}_i(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{v}_i(t+\\Delta t/2) + \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_i(t+\\Delta t)}{m} \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\n    $$\nThis algorithm evolves the system's trajectory, from which the metrics $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ and $\\Delta E$ are computed. For this model, the total energy includes both kinetic and potential terms. The time step $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{B}}$ must be small enough to resolve the high-frequency bond vibrations, whose characteristic period is approximately $2\\pi\\sqrt{m/(2k)}$.\n\n### Metrics Computation\n\nFor both models, the simulation runs for $N = \\lceil T/\\Delta t \\rceil$ steps. At each step $n=0, 1, \\dots, N$, the bond length is computed to calculate the root-mean-square deviation $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rms}}$. The total energy $E$ is computed at $t=0$ and $t=N\\Delta t$ to find the absolute energy drift $\\Delta E = |E(t=N\\Delta t)-E(0)|$.",

The system consists of six identical point masses representing the carbon skeleton of a planar hexagon. Each point mass has mass $12.0$ in atomic mass units. Let $N$ be the number of particles, with $N=6$, and let $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ denote the planar positions arranged as $(x_0,y_0,x_1,y_1,\\dots,x_{N-1},y_{N-1})$, and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ denote the corresponding velocities. There are no external forces. All angles in any trigonometric computation must be in radians. All lengths must be in angstroms (Å), all times in femtoseconds (fs), and all velocities in angstroms per femtosecond (Å/fs).\n\nDefine a reference configuration $q_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ as a regular hexagon of side length $1.397$ placed in the plane with its center at the origin, with vertices at angles $2\\pi k/6$ for integer $k$ from $0$ to $5$, scaled so that the side length is $1.397$. Construct a set of pairwise distance constraints between selected particle pairs $\\mathcal{S}$ that makes the hexagon rigid in the plane up to overall translation and rotation: include the six ring edges $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,5)$, $(5,0)$, and add three diagonals $(0,2)$, $(0,3)$, $(0,4)$. For each pair $(i,j)\\in\\mathcal{S}$, define the target distance $d_{ij}$ to equal the Euclidean distance between the corresponding vertices in $q_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. For any configuration $q$, define the holonomic constraint functions\n$$\ng_{ij}(q) \\equiv \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\lVert r_i-r_j\\rVert^2 - d_{ij}^2\\right),\n$$\nwhere $r_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the position of particle $k$ extracted from $q$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Methodology\n\nThe problem requires implementing a single time step of a constrained dynamics integrator. The algorithm is a specific sequence of operations: an unconstrained \"drift\" step followed by projection steps to enforce the position and velocity constraints. This can be viewed as a geometric integrator constructed via a Lie-Trotter splitting of the free-flow and constraint-projection operators. With zero external forces, the unconstrained dynamics is a simple drift. The core of the problem lies in implementing the projection steps. Both projections are defined as finding a minimal correction (in a mass-weighted sense) to satisfy the constraints. This is solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\n**1. System Setup**\nThe system consists of $N=6$ particles, each with mass $m_k = 12.0$. The positions are stored in a vector $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{12}$, and velocities in $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{12}$. The mass matrix $M$ is a diagonal $12 \\times 12$ matrix with the masses on the diagonal. Since all masses are equal to $m=12.0$, $M = mI$, and its inverse is $M^{-1} = (1/m)I$.\n\nThe reference configuration $q_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is a regular hexagon with side length $d = 1.397$ Å. The position of particle $k$ is $r_k^{\\mathrm{ref}} = (d \\cos(2\\pi k/6), d \\sin(2\\pi k/6))$. The $m=9$ constraints are given by the set of pairs $\\mathcal{S}$. For each pair $(i,j) \\in \\mathcal{S}$, the squared target distance $d_{ij}^2 = \\lVert r_i^{\\mathrm{ref}} - r_j^{\\mathrm{ref}} \\rVert^2$ is pre-calculated. The holonomic constraint functions are $g_{ij}(q) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lVert r_i-r_j\\rVert^2 - d_{ij}^2)$.\n\n**2. Position Correction (SHAKE-like Projection)**\nAfter the unconstrained drift $q^\\ast = q(0) + \\Delta t v(0)$, we must find a correction $\\Delta q$ such that $q(\\Delta t) = q^\\ast + \\Delta q$ satisfies $g(q(\\Delta t)) = 0$. The correction $\\Delta q$ must minimize $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta q^T M \\Delta q$. The method of Lagrange multipliers leads to the condition that the correction must be a linear combination of the constraint gradients at the final position $q(\\Delta t)$:\n$$\nM \\Delta q = -G(q(\\Delta t))^T \\lambda\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is a vector of Lagrange multipliers and $G(q)$ is the $m \\times 2N$ Jacobian matrix of the constraint functions, with rows $\\nabla g_{ij}(q)^T$. Substituting $\\Delta q = -M^{-1}G(q(\\Delta t))^T \\lambda$ into the definition of $q(\\Delta t)$ gives $q(\\Delta t) = q^\\ast - M^{-1}G(q(\\Delta t))^T \\lambda$. This, combined with the constraint equations $g(q(\\Delta t))=0$, forms a system of non-linear equations for $\\lambda$.\n\nThis system is solved iteratively using a Newton-Raphson method. Starting with an initial guess $q^{(0)} = q^\\ast$, each iteration $k$ computes a correction to $q^{(k)}$ by solving a linearized system. The update step is derived by solving for multipliers $\\lambda^{(k)}$ in the linear system:\n$$\n\\left( G(q^{(k)}) M^{-1} G(q^{(k)})^T \\right) \\lambda^{(k)} = g(q^{(k)})\n$$\nand then updating the positions:\n$$\nq^{(k+1)} = q^{(k)} - M^{-1}G(q^{(k)})^T \\lambda^{(k)}\n$$\nThis process is repeated until the constraint violations $\\max_l |g_l(q^{(k)})|$ fall below a numerical tolerance (e.g., $10^{-14}$ Å$^2$). The resulting position is $q(\\Delta t) = q^{(\\text{final})}$.\n\nThe Jacobian $G(q)$ has a sparse structure. For a constraint $g_{ij}$, the only non-zero entries in its gradient $\\nabla g_{ij}(q)$ are for particles $i$ and $j$: $\\nabla_{r_i} g_{ij} = (r_i - r_j)$ and $\\nabla_{r_j} g_{ij} = -(r_i - r_j)$.\n\n**3. Velocity Correction (RATTLE-like Projection)**\nNext, we find the corrected velocity $v(\\Delta t) = v(0) + \\Delta v$ that satisfies the velocity constraints $G(q(\\Delta t))v(\\Delta t) = 0$ and minimizes $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta v^T M \\Delta v$.\nAgain, the method of Lagrange multipliers states that the correction $\\Delta v$ must be in the space spanned by the constraint gradients:\n$$\nM \\Delta v = -G(q(\\Delta t))^T \\mu\n$$\nwhere $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ are Lagrange multipliers. Substituting this into the velocity constraint equation:\n$$\nG(q(\\Delta t)) (v(0) - M^{-1}G(q(\\Delta t))^T \\mu) = 0\n$$\nThis yields a linear system for the multipliers $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\left( G(q(\\Delta t)) M^{-1} G(q(\\Delta t))^T \\right) \\mu = G(q(\\Delta t)) v(0)\n$$\nThe matrix $G M^{-1} G^T$ is the same $m \\times m$ matrix structure encountered in the position correction step, but evaluated at the new position $q(\\Delta t)$. After solving for $\\mu$, the final velocity is computed as:\n$$\nv(\\Delta t) = v(0) - M^{-1}G(q(\\Delta t))^T \\mu\n$$\nThis is a direct, non-iterative calculation. The resulting $v(\\Delta t)$ will satisfy the velocity constraints to machine precision.\n\nFinally, the required maximum absolute constraint violations, $r_{\\mathrm{pos}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{vel}}$, are calculated using the final state $(q(\\Delta t), v(\\Delta t))$.",
