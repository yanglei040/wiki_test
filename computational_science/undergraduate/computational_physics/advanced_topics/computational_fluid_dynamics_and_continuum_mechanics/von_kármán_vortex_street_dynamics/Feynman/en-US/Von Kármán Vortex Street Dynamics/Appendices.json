A powerful way to probe the physics of such an oscillator is to subject it to external forcing, such as a pulsating inflow velocity $U(t) = U_0 (1 + A \\sin(\\omega t))$. This practice challenges you to reason about the rich dynamics that emerge, including fundamental concepts like quasi-steady response, resonance, and frequency lock-in, which are universal features of forced nonlinear systems .",

            "problem": "A two-dimensional, incompressible, laminar flow past a fixed circular cylinder of diameter $D$ in a fluid of density $\\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is driven by a uniform, time-periodic inlet velocity $U(t) = U_0 \\left(1 + A \\sin(\\omega t)\\right)$ with $0 < A < 1$. The mean Reynolds number is $Re_0 = U_0 D/\\nu$, chosen such that, under steady inflow $U(t) \\equiv U_0$, the wake exhibits a stable von Kármán vortex street characterized by a natural shedding frequency $f_s^0$ and a Strouhal number $\\mathrm{St}_0 = f_s^0 D/U_0$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Flow type: Two-dimensional, incompressible, laminar flow.\n- Object: Fixed circular cylinder of diameter $D$.\n- Fluid properties: Density $\\rho$, kinematic viscosity $\\nu$.\n- Inlet velocity: $U(t) = U_0 \\left(1 + A \\sin(\\omega t)\\right)$, with $0 < A < 1$.\n- Mean Reynolds number: $Re_0 = U_0 D/\\nu$.\n- Baseline flow condition (steady inflow $U(t) \\equiv U_0$): Stable von Kármán vortex street is exhibited.\n- Natural shedding frequency (steady inflow): $f_s^0$.\n- Natural Strouhal number (steady inflow): $\\mathrm{St}_0 = f_s^0 D/U_0$.\n- Instantaneous Strouhal number definition: $\\mathrm{St}(t) = f_s(t) D/U(t)$.\n- Instantaneous shedding frequency: $f_s(t)$.\n- The question asks to evaluate statements about the effect of the inlet pulsation for various $A$ and $\\omega$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes flow past a cylinder with a time-periodic inlet velocity. This is a canonical problem in fluid dynamics used to study wake dynamics, flow control, and fluid-structure interaction. The concepts of Reynolds number, Strouhal number, von Kármán vortex street, synchronization (lock-in), and modulation are fundamental and well-established in this field.

The setup is self-consistent.\n- **Realism**: The physical situation is realistic and is a subject of extensive study through numerical simulations (computational physics) and laboratory experiments.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- The problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in fluid dynamics. I will proceed with the analysis of the options.\n\n**Analysis of the Physical System**\n\nThe system described is a forced nonlinear oscillator. The natural, self-sustained oscillation is the von Kármán vortex shedding with a natural frequency $f_s^0$. This oscillation is forced by the periodic inlet velocity at a forcing frequency $f_e = \\omega/(2\\pi)$. The response of the system depends critically on the parameters of the forcing: the amplitude $A$ and the frequency ratio $f_e/f_s^0$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. For small $A$ and slow, off-resonant forcing, specifically $\\Omega = \\omega D/U_0 \\ll 2\\pi \\mathrm{St}_0$, the wake responds quasi-steadily: a staggered von Kármán street persists, and the instantaneous shedding frequency approximately follows $f_s(t) \\approx \\mathrm{St}\\!\\left(Re(t)\\right)\\, U(t)/D$ with $Re(t) = Re_0 \\left(1 + A \\sin(\\omega t)\\right)$, leading to amplitude and phase modulation about the mean state.**\n\nThe condition $\\Omega = \\omega D/U_0 \\ll 2\\pi \\mathrm{St}_0$ is analyzed. Substituting $\\mathrm{St}_0 = f_s^0 D/U_0$, we get $\\omega D/U_0 \\ll 2\\pi (f_s^0 D/U_0)$, which simplifies to $\\omega \\ll 2\\pi f_s^0$, or $f_e \\ll f_s^0$. This means the forcing period is much longer than the natural shedding period. This is the definition of a quasi-steady or adiabatic process. The system has sufficient time to adjust to the slowly changing conditions. The instantaneous state of the flow is expected to be nearly identical to the steady-state flow at the corresponding instantaneous velocity $U(t)$. The instantaneous Reynolds number is $Re(t) = U(t)D/\\nu = (U_0 D/\\nu)(1+A\\sin(\\omega t)) = Re_0(1+A\\sin(\\omega t))$. The Strouhal number $St$ is a weak function of the Reynolds number in the laminar shedding regime. Therefore, the instantaneous shedding frequency $f_s(t)$ will be given by the Strouhal relation for the instantaneous conditions: $f_s(t) \\approx \\mathrm{St}(Re(t)) U(t)/D$. As $U(t)$ and $Re(t)$ vary sinusoidally, so will $f_s(t)$ and the vortex strength, leading to amplitude and frequency (and thus phase) modulation of the wake. The staggered (antisymmetric) pattern of the vortex street will persist, as this is the stable mode in this Reynolds number range. The statement is an accurate description of the quasi-steady response.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. When $\\omega$ is sufficiently close to $2\\pi f_s^0$, even for modest $A$, the shedding synchronizes (locks in) to the forcing so that the dominant shedding frequency equals $\\omega/(2\\pi)$, and the vortex street becomes more temporally regular with reduced phase wandering.**\n\nThe condition $\\omega \\approx 2\\pi f_s^0$ means the forcing frequency $f_e = \\omega/(2\\pi)$ is close to the natural shedding frequency $f_s^0$. This is the condition for resonance. The vortex shedding mechanism, acting as a nonlinear oscillator, can synchronize with the external forcing. This phenomenon is known as lock-in or frequency entrainment. When locked-in, the shedding frequency is no longer the natural frequency $f_s^0$ but becomes equal to the forcing frequency $f_e$. This synchronization occurs within a certain range of forcing frequencies and amplitudes, described by \"Arnold tongues\" in the parameter space. A key feature of synchronization is that the phase of the oscillation becomes locked to the phase of the forcing, which drastically reduces the natural, slow, random drift of the phase (phase wandering) that is characteristic of unforced vortex shedding. This results in a more organized and temporally regular vortex street. The statement correctly describes the phenomenon of lock-in.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. If $A$ is large enough that $Re(t)$ falls below the critical Reynolds number for onset of vortex shedding during part of the cycle, the formation of vortices is intermittently suppressed within each period, fragmenting the street and degrading its spatial coherence.**\n\nThe onset of von Kármán vortex shedding from a steady flow past a circular cylinder occurs at a critical Reynolds number, $Re_{crit} \\approx 47$. Below this value, the wake is steady and symmetric. The instantaneous Reynolds number is $Re(t) = Re_0(1+A\\sin(\\omega t))$, which has a minimum value of $Re_{min} = Re_0(1-A)$. If the forcing amplitude $A$ is large enough, it is possible for $Re_{min}$ to be less than $Re_{crit}$, even if the mean Reynolds number $Re_0$ is well within the shedding regime. For instance, if $Re_0=100$ and $A=0.6$, then $Re_{min} = 100(1-0.6) = 40 < 47$. During the portions of the cycle where $Re(t) < Re_{crit}$, the flow instability driving vortex shedding is stabilized, and shedding ceases. When $Re(t)$ later increases above $Re_{crit}$, the shedding process must re-initiate. This intermittent start-and-stop of vortex formation within each forcing period prevents the development of a continuous, coherent vortex street, leading to a \"fragmented\" wake structure with poor spatial coherence. This physical reasoning is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. If $\\omega \\gg 2\\pi f_s^0$, then regardless of $A$ and $Re_0$ in the laminar shedding regime, the high-frequency inlet forcing necessarily destabilizes the wake and produces turbulence downstream.**\n\nThe condition $\\omega \\gg 2\\pi f_s^0$ means the forcing frequency is much higher than the natural shedding frequency. Due to the inertia of the fluid, the large-scale flow structures of the wake cannot respond to such rapid forcing. Instead, the flow effectively responds to the time-averaged velocity, which is $U_0$. The high-frequency pulsations are filtered out or manifest as small-scale, high-frequency velocity fluctuations superposed on the mean flow. Contrary to the statement's claim, high-frequency forcing does not necessarily destabilize the wake; in some contexts, it can have a stabilizing effect on the primary shedding instability by disrupting the feedback mechanism that sustains it. The claim that it \"necessarily\" produces turbulence \"regardless of $A$ and $Re_0$\" is a strong generalization that is incorrect. For a very small amplitude $A$, the effect would be negligible. For a baseline flow deep within the laminar regime, high-frequency forcing is not a guaranteed trigger for turbulence. Turbulence is a complex, multi-scale phenomenon, and simply adding a high-frequency component to the inlet does not ensure its onset.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Any time-dependent inlet of the form $U(t) = U_0 \\left(1 + A \\sin(\\omega t)\\right)$ breaks the antisymmetric staggered pattern so that the wake sheds vortices symmetrically from both sides of the cylinder at all $\\omega$ and $A$.**\n\nThe von Kármán vortex street is fundamentally an antisymmetric (staggered) pattern, resulting from a symmetry-breaking instability of the symmetric flow. The forcing applied, $U(t)$, is purely in the streamwise direction and is spatially uniform. It preserves the geometric symmetry of the problem about the cylinder's centerline. There is no component in the forcing that preferentially excites a symmetric mode over the naturally preferred antisymmetric one. While the forcing can modify the frequency and amplitude of the antisymmetric shedding, it does not inherently change its fundamental spatial structure. Symmetric shedding (where pairs of vortices are shed simultaneously from the top and bottom) is a different, typically unstable mode. The claim that symmetric shedding occurs for *all* $\\omega$ and $A$ is particularly egregious and demonstrably false; for example, the quasi-steady regime described in option A maintains the staggered street.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. For small $A$ with off-resonant forcing, a frequency analysis of the lift coefficient $C_L(t) = L(t)/\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho U_0^2 D\\right)$ reveals spectral sidebands at $f_s^0 \\pm n \\omega/(2\\pi)$ for integer $n \\ge 1$, reflecting amplitude and phase modulation of the global shedding mode.**\n\nThe lift coefficient $C_L(t)$ is a direct measure of the antisymmetric vortex shedding. In the unforced case, its spectrum is dominated by a peak at the Strouhal frequency $f_s^0$. The forcing introduces a second frequency, $f_e = \\omega/(2\\pi)$. The wake dynamics are governed by the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations. When a nonlinear system is driven by two frequencies, the output signal generally contains not only the original frequencies but also their harmonics and a series of sum and difference frequencies (intermodulation products). This is the mathematical basis of modulation. A signal with carrier frequency $f_s^0$ that is amplitude- and/or phase-modulated by a frequency $f_e$ will exhibit spectral peaks at $f_s^0$ (the carrier) and at sideband frequencies $f_s^0 \\pm n f_e$ for integers $n \\ge 1$. Here, $f_e = \\omega/(2\\pi)$. Thus, the spectrum of $C_L(t)$ is expected to show peaks at $f_s^0 \\pm n \\omega/(2\\pi)$. This spectral signature is a classic indicator of modulation and has been widely observed in fluid dynamics experiments and simulations involving forced wakes.\n**Verdict: Correct**",

You should take $\\beta_i = 0$ so that nonlinear saturation does not shift the frequency.\n\n- By symmetry, reversing the cylinder spin, $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$, changes the sign of the Magnus-induced circulation and hence the phase speed of the global mode but not its linear growth rate. Therefore, the leading dependence of the linear growth rate on $\\alpha$ is even, whereas the leading dependence of the linear frequency on $\\alpha$ is odd:\n  $$\n  \\mu(Re,\\alpha) = \\mu_0(Re) - k\\, \\alpha^2,\\qquad\n  f_{\\text{lin}}(Re,\\alpha) = \\dfrac{U_0}{D}\\,\\Big( St_0(Re) + s\\, \\alpha \\Big).\n  $$\n\n- Use the widely reported critical Reynolds number $Re_c = 47$ for the onset of vortex shedding in the non-rotating case.

            "problem": "You are to formulate and solve an inverse problem in the context of von Kármán vortex street dynamics. Consider two-dimensional, incompressible, viscous flow past a circular cylinder. Beyond a critical Reynolds number, periodic vortex shedding occurs, producing a near-monochromatic oscillation in the streamwise velocity at downstream points. You are given a streamwise velocity time-series $u(t)$ measured at a single point that is sufficiently far from the wake centerline so that its time-average approximates the free-stream speed to within small error. Your task is to recover the dimensionless Reynolds number $Re$ from $u(t)$ alone. Your program must do this by estimating the characteristic shedding frequency and using appropriate non-dimensional analysis, strictly from first principles.\n\nFundamental base you must use:\n- The Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible flow admit non-dimensionalization that introduces the Reynolds number $Re$ and the Strouhal number $St$. The Reynolds number is defined by $Re = U_{\\infty} D / \\nu$, where $U_{\\infty}$ is the free-stream speed, $D$ is the cylinder diameter, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.\n- The Strouhal number is defined by $St = f D / U_{\\infty}$, where $f$ is the shedding frequency.\n- In the classical laminar vortex shedding regime behind a circular cylinder with $Re$ in the range $100 \\lesssim Re \\lesssim 1000$, numerous experiments have established that $St$ is approximately constant with weak dependence on $Re$, taking a representative value $St \\approx 0.2$.\n- To estimate the dominant frequency from $u(t)$, use Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). You must address spectral leakage (e.g., by windowing) and finite-time resolution (frequency bin spacing given by $1/T$ for record length $T$), and you may refine the peak estimate by local interpolation.\n\nYour implementation must be general and principled: estimate the dominant shedding frequency from the data and deduce $Re$ using only the above fundamental definitions and facts. Do not use any formula not derivable from these bases.\n\nSynthetic data generation protocol for testing:\nFor each test case, a synthetic time series is constructed to emulate the measured $u(t)$ at a downstream point:\n- The signal model is\n$$\nu(t_i) = U_{\\infty} + A \\sin\\!\\left(2\\pi f\\, t_i + \\phi\\right) + r_2 A \\sin\\!\\left(4\\pi f\\, t_i + \\psi\\right) + \\eta(t_i),\n$$\nwhere $t_i = i \\Delta t$, $i=0,1,\\dots,N-1$, $\\Delta t = 1/f_s$, $N = T f_s$, and $\\eta(t_i)$ is Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n- The shedding frequency used to synthesize the data is $f = St\\, U_{\\infty} / D$ with $St = 0.2$. Phases $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are independently and uniformly distributed in $[0,2\\pi)$, drawn deterministically from the given random seed.\n\nAll physical quantities must be in International System of Units (SI): meters for length, seconds for time. The Reynolds number $Re$ is dimensionless; express your final answers as integers by rounding to the nearest whole number.\n\nYour program must do the following for each test case:\n- Generate the synthetic time series $u(t)$ according to the parameters below.\n- Estimate the dominant shedding frequency $f$ from $u(t)$ using a suitable spectral method that addresses leakage and resolution.\n- From first principles and the definitions above, infer $Re$.\n- Round the inferred $Re$ to the nearest integer.\n\nTest suite (four cases):\nCommon parameters for all cases: sampling rate $f_s = 200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, record length $T = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}$, Strouhal number for synthesis $St = 0.2$.\n- Case $1$: $D = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\nu = 1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $U_{\\infty} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $A = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $r_2 = 0.30$, $\\sigma = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, random seed $123$.\n- Case $2$: $D = 0.008\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\nu = 1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $U_{\\infty} = 0.24\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $A = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $r_2 = 0.40$, $\\sigma = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, random seed $456$.\n- Case $3$: $D = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\nu = 1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $U_{\\infty} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $A = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $r_2 = 0.25$, $\\sigma = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, random seed $789$.\n- Case $4$: $D = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\nu = 1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $U_{\\infty} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $A = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $r_2 = 0.35$, $\\sigma = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, random seed $321$.\n\nNumerical and algorithmic requirements:\n- Use a tapering window (e.g., Hann) before computing the DFT to mitigate leakage.\n- Exclude the zero-frequency bin when detecting the spectral peak.\n- You may refine the peak frequency via local quadratic (parabolic) interpolation using the magnitudes of the peak bin and its neighbors.\n- Because the data length is finite, discuss and account for the frequency resolution $\\Delta f = 1/T$ and ensure your estimation handles the non-bin-centered case robustly.\n\nAngle units are radians for any internally used phases.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the four rounded Reynolds numbers for Cases $1$–$4$, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4]$).",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated. The problem is a well-posed computational task in signal processing, framed within the context of fluid dynamics. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of vortex shedding and non-dimensional analysis. The core task is to invert a synthetic data generation process, which is a valid and self-contained mathematical problem. A minor point of critique is that some test cases use parameters that yield a Reynolds number outside the specified range of $100 \\lesssim Re \\lesssim 1000$ where the Strouhal number $St$ is known to be approximately constant at $St \\approx 0.2$. However, the problem explicitly mandates that the synthetic data be generated using $St=0.2$ regardless of the resulting $Re$. Therefore, the problem is internally consistent from a computational standpoint, and we shall proceed by adhering strictly to the data generation model and the given physical relations.\n\nThe problem is to determine the Reynolds number, $Re$, from a time-series of velocity, $u(t)$, given knowledge of the cylinder diameter $D$ and the fluid's kinematic viscosity $\\nu$. The fundamental definitions are:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{U_{\\infty} D}{\\nu}\n$$\nand the Strouhal number,\n$$\nSt = \\frac{f D}{U_{\\infty}}\n$$\nwhere $U_{\\infty}$ is the free-stream velocity and $f$ is the vortex shedding frequency. The problem provides the empirical fact that in the relevant regime, $St$ can be approximated as a constant, $St_{\\text{assumed}} = 0.2$.\n\nOur task is to find a robust method to estimate $Re$ from $u(t)$, using the given parameters $D$, $\\nu$, and the constant $St_{\\text{assumed}} = 0.2$. The time series $u(t)$ contains two key pieces of information: its mean value, which approximates $U_{\\infty}$, and its dominant frequency, which corresponds to $f$. A naive approach might be to estimate $U_{\\infty}$ by taking the mean of $u(t)$ and then directly calculating $Re$. However, this fails to utilize the frequency information, which is the most prominent feature of the dynamics. A more principled approach, which connects all the given physical laws, is required.\n\nWe can combine the definitions of $Re$ and $St$ to derive a formula for $Re$ that depends on the frequency $f$. From the definition of the Strouhal number, we can express the free-stream velocity $U_{\\infty}$ in terms of the frequency $f$:\n$$\nU_{\\infty} = \\frac{f D}{St}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $U_{\\infty}$ into the definition of the Reynolds number yields:\n$$\nRe = \\left( \\frac{f D}{St} \\right) \\frac{D}{\\nu} = \\frac{f D^2}{St \\cdot \\nu}\n$$\nThis relationship is superior because it directly computes $Re$ from the shedding frequency $f$, which is the primary characteristic of the vortex street phenomenon encoded in the oscillatory part of the signal. The problem thus reduces to obtaining an accurate estimate of $f$ from the provided time series $u(t)$. We will denote this estimate as $f_{\\text{est}}$. The estimated Reynolds number will then be:\n$$\nRe_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{f_{\\text{est}} D^2}{St_{\\text{assumed}} \\cdot \\nu}\n$$\nwhere $St_{\\text{assumed}} = 0.2$.\n\nThe estimation of the dominant frequency $f_{\\text{est}}$ must be performed with care. A discrete time series of finite length $T$ sampled at a frequency $f_s$ inherently poses challenges for spectral analysis. The algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Signal Pre-processing**: The raw signal $u(t)$ contains a large DC offset equal to $U_{\\infty}$. To analyze the oscillatory components, this offset must be removed. We compute the mean of the signal, $\\langle u \\rangle = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} u(t_i)$, and subtract it to obtain the fluctuating component, $u'(t_i) = u(t_i) - \\langle u \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Windowing**: A finite-length signal, when analyzed with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), is implicitly treated as one period of an infinitely periodic signal. If the true frequency of a component is not an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency resolution $\\Delta f = 1/T$, a discontinuity occurs at the boundaries of the time window. This leads to spectral leakage, where the energy of the signal component spreads across multiple frequency bins, distorting the spectrum and making the peak location inaccurate. To mitigate this, we apply a tapering window function to the signal $u'(t_i)$ before the transform. A Hann window, $w(i) = 0.5 \\left(1-\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{N-1}\\right)\\right)$, is suitable for this purpose. The windowed signal is $u_w(t_i) = u'(t_i) \\cdot w(i)$.\n\n3.  **Spectral Analysis via FFT**: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm is used to efficiently compute the DFT of the windowed signal $u_w(t_i)$. For a real-valued input signal, the resulting spectrum is conjugate-symmetric, so we need only compute the one-sided spectrum for positive frequencies. The `numpy.fft.rfft` function is appropriate. This yields a set of complex-valued coefficients, $Y_k$, corresponding to frequencies $f_k = k \\cdot \\Delta f = k/T$, for $k=0, 1, \\dots, N/2$.\n\n4.  **Peak Detection and Refinement**: The dominant shedding frequency corresponds to the peak in the magnitude spectrum, $|Y_k|$. We search for the maximum magnitude, ignoring the $k=0$ (DC) component. Let the index of the maximum magnitude be $k_{\\text{peak}}$. Due to the finite frequency resolution $\\Delta f$, the true frequency may lie between bins. To obtain a sub-bin resolution estimate, we perform parabolic interpolation on the spectral peak. We use the magnitude of the peak bin, $m_k = |Y_k|$, and its immediate neighbors to define a parabola. The vertex of this parabola gives a refined estimate of the peak location. The offset $\\delta_k$ from the discrete peak index $k_{\\text{peak}}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\delta_k = \\frac{m_{k_{\\text{peak}}+1} - m_{k_{\\text{peak}}-1}}{2 \\left( 2m_{k_{\\text{peak}}} - m_{k_{\\text{peak}}-1} - m_{k_{\\text{peak}}+1} \\right)}\n$$\nThe refined peak frequency is then calculated as:\n$$\nf_{\\text{est}} = (k_{\\text{peak}} + \\delta_k) \\cdot \\Delta f = \\frac{k_{\\text{peak}} + \\delta_k}{T}\n$$\nThis robustly handles cases where the true frequency is not an integer multiple of $\\Delta f$, as is the situation in Case 3.\n\nBy following this rigorous procedure, we obtain an accurate estimate of the shedding frequency $f_{\\text{est}}$, from which the Reynolds number $Re_{\\text{est}}$ is calculated using the previously derived formula. The final result is rounded to the nearest integer as required.",
