            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard problem in the study of nonlinear dynamics, specifically the logistic map for the parameter value corresponding to fully developed chaos. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe system is described by the logistic map recurrence relation:\n$$x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1 - x_n)$$\nwith an initial condition $x_0 \\in (0,1)$ and for integer indices $n \\ge 0$. We are instructed to use the transformation $x_n = \\sin^2(\\theta_n)$, where $\\theta_n \\in [0, \\pi)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the evolution law for the angular variable $\\theta_n$. We substitute the transformation into the recurrence relation:\n$$x_{n+1} = 4 \\sin^2(\\theta_n) (1 - \\sin^2(\\theta_n))$$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(\\alpha) + \\sin^2(\\alpha) = 1$, we replace $(1 - \\sin^2(\\theta_n))$ with $\\cos^2(\\theta_n)$:\n$$x_{n+1} = 4 \\sin^2(\\theta_n) \\cos^2(\\theta_n)$$\nThis expression can be rearranged as the square of a product:\n$$x_{n+1} = (2 \\sin(\\theta_n) \\cos(\\theta_n))^2$$\nWe recognize the term in the parenthesis as the sine double-angle identity, $\\sin(2\\alpha) = 2 \\sin(\\alpha) \\cos(\\alpha)$. Applying this identity yields:\n$$x_{n+1} = (\\sin(2\\theta_n))^2 = \\sin^2(2\\theta_n)$$\nBy the definition of the transformation, we also have $x_{n+1} = \\sin^2(\\theta_{n+1})$. Equating the two expressions for $x_{n+1}$, we get:\n$$\\sin^2(\\theta_{n+1}) = \\sin^2(2\\theta_n)$$\nSince $\\theta_{n+1}$ must lie in the interval $[0, \\pi)$, this equation implies that $\\theta_{n+1}$ is related to $2\\theta_n$ by a shift of an integer multiple of $\\pi$. Specifically, the evolution law for $\\theta_n$ is the dyadic transformation (or Bernoulli shift map) on the circle $\\mathbb{R}/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$:\n$$\\theta_{n+1} = 2\\theta_n \\pmod{\\pi}$$\nThis means that $\\theta_{n+1}$ is the remainder of $2\\theta_n$ after division by $\\pi$, such that the result is in $[0,\\pi)$. This is the exact evolution law for $\\theta_{n+1}$ in terms of $\\theta_n$.\n\nNext, we seek a closed-form expression for $x_N$. To achieve this, we first solve the recurrence for $\\theta_n$. The relation $\\theta_{n+1} \\equiv 2\\theta_n \\pmod{\\pi}$ is a simple geometric progression modulo $\\pi$. We can solve it by iteration:\n$$\\theta_1 \\equiv 2\\theta_0 \\pmod{\\pi}$$\n$$\\theta_2 \\equiv 2\\theta_1 \\equiv 2(2\\theta_0) \\equiv 2^2\\theta_0 \\pmod{\\pi}$$\n$$\\theta_3 \\equiv 2\\theta_2 \\equiv 2(2^2\\theta_0) \\equiv 2^3\\theta_0 \\pmod{\\pi}$$\nBy induction, it is trivial to see that the general term $\\theta_N$ is given by:\n$$\\theta_N \\equiv 2^N \\theta_0 \\pmod{\\pi}$$\nThis congruence implies that $\\theta_N$ can be written as $\\theta_N = 2^N\\theta_0 - k\\pi$ for some integer $k$ chosen to map the result into the interval $[0, \\pi)$.\n\nFinally, we express $x_N$ in terms of $\\theta_0$ and $N$. We substitute our result for $\\theta_N$ back into the transformation $x_N = \\sin^2(\\theta_N)$:\n$$x_N = \\sin^2(2^N \\theta_0 - k\\pi)$$\nThe sine function has the property that $\\sin(\\alpha - k\\pi) = (-1)^k \\sin(\\alpha)$. Consequently, the square of the sine function is periodic with period $\\pi$:\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha - k\\pi) = ((-1)^k \\sin(\\alpha))^2 = (-1)^{2k} \\sin^2(\\alpha) = \\sin^2(\\alpha)$$\nApplying this property to our expression for $x_N$, the term $-k\\pi$ has no effect on the value.\n$$x_N = \\sin^2(2^N \\theta_0)$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for $x_N$ as a function of the initial angle $\\theta_0$ and the number of iterations $N$.",

Landmarks in the journey from order to chaos are the 'supercycle' parameters, where the map's critical point joins a periodic orbit, leading to exceptionally stable behavior. This practice guides you through developing a numerical algorithm to hunt for these special $r$ values by combining a systematic search with a high-precision root-finding method . Mastering this technique allows you to computationally trace the backbone of the famous period-doubling bifurcation diagram.",

The critical point is $x_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1/2$. A parameter value $r$ is called a supercycle (also called superstable) of primitive period $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ if the critical point is periodic with exact minimal period $p$, that is, the $p$-fold composition $f_{r}^{(p)}$ satisfies $f_{r}^{(p)}(1/2) = 1/2$ while $f_{r}^{(q)}(1/2) \\neq 1/2$ for every proper divisor $q$ of $p$. Equivalently, a supercycle of period $p$ is a solution $r \\in [0,4]$ of the scalar equation $g_{p}(r) = f_{r}^{(p)}(1/2) - 1/2 = 0$ such that no $g_{q}(r)$ vanishes for any proper divisor $q$ of $p$. The function $g_{p}$ is continuous in $r$ because it is obtained by finitely many compositions of polynomials in $r$ and $x$ with initial $x=1/2$.\n\nYour task is to develop an algorithm that, for each prescribed integer period $p$, locates with high precision the smallest parameter value $r \\in (0,4]$ such that $x=1/2$ is periodic of primitive period $p$. Your algorithm must be justified from first principles by using only foundational facts: continuity of polynomial maps, properties of function iteration, and the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT). You must not use closed-form expressions for any special parameter values.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements:\n1) Define the logistic map $f_{r}(x) = r\\,x\\,(1-x)$ and its $p$-fold iterate $f_{r}^{(p)}$ at $x=1/2$ by explicit iteration. Define $g_{p}(r) = f_{r}^{(p)}(1/2) - 1/2$.\n2) For each period $p$, search for sign changes of $g_{p}(r)$ over a dense grid on $[0,4]$ to obtain brackets $\\,[a,b]\\,$ for which $g_{p}(a)\\,g_{p}(b) \\le 0$. Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to justify that each bracket contains at least one root. Then refine each bracket to a root with a robust bracketing method such as bisection or Brent’s method, ensuring numerical tolerances that achieve absolute accuracy better than $10^{-10}$ in $r$.\n3) Filter the roots so that only those with primitive period exactly $p$ remain. Concretely, for each candidate root $r^{\\star}$ of $g_{p}$, verify that $|g_{q}(r^{\\star})|$ is larger than a small threshold for every proper divisor $q$ of $p$. Equivalently, numerically confirm that no earlier return $f_{r^{\\star}}^{(q)}(1/2) = 1/2$ occurs for $q$ a proper divisor of $p$. Among the remaining candidates, select the smallest $r$.\n4) All numerical comparisons to zero should use a clearly stated tolerance. Use absolute tolerances for function values and a combined absolute and relative tolerance for root refinement.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed computational physics task. It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of discrete dynamical systems, specifically the study of the logistic map. The objective is clearly defined, all necessary parameters and constraints are provided, and the problem is free of ambiguity, contradiction, or factual error. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the smallest supercycle parameter $r_{p} \\in (0,4]$ for primitive periods $p \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. A parameter value $r$ corresponds to a supercycle of primitive period $p$ if the critical point of the logistic map, $x_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1/2$, is a periodic point of minimal period $p$.\n\nThe logistic map is defined as:\n$$f_{r}(x) = r\\,x\\,(1-x)$$\nwhere the state variable $x$ is on the unit interval $[0,1]$ and the bifurcation parameter $r$ is in the range $[0,4]$.\n\nThe condition for the critical point $x_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1/2$ to be periodic with period $p$ is that its $p$-th iterate returns to itself:\n$$f_{r}^{(p)}(1/2) = 1/2$$\nwhere $f_{r}^{(p)}$ denotes the $p$-fold composition of the map $f_{r}$ with itself. This can be expressed as finding the roots of the function $g_{p}(r)$:\n$$g_{p}(r) = f_{r}^{(p)}(1/2) - 1/2 = 0$$\nThe function $g_{p}(r)$ is constructed by iterating the map, starting with $x_{0} = 1/2$:\n$x_{1} = f_{r}(x_{0}) = f_{r}(1/2) = r/4$\n$x_{2} = f_{r}(x_{1}) = f_{r}(r/4) = r(r/4)(1 - r/4)$\n$...$\n$x_{p} = f_{r}^{(p)}(1/2)$\nThus, $g_{p}(r) = x_{p} - 1/2$. Since $f_{r}(x)$ is a polynomial in both $r$ and $x$, and the iteration starts with a constant, the resulting function $g_{p}(r)$ is a polynomial in $r$. As a polynomial, $g_{p}(r)$ is continuous for all $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This fundamental property justifies the use of root-finding algorithms based on the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).\n\nA root $r^{\\star}$ of $g_{p}(r) = 0$ corresponds to a supercycle of *primitive* period $p$ only if the orbit of $x_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1/2$ does not return to $1/2$ at any earlier iteration $q$ which is a proper divisor of $p$. That is, for a given root $r^{\\star}$:\n$$f_{r^{\\star}}^{(q)}(1/2) \\neq 1/2 \\quad \\text{for all } q \\in \\{1, 2, ..., p-1\\} \\text{ such that } p \\pmod q = 0$$\nThis is equivalent to the condition $g_{q}(r^{\\star}) \\neq 0$ for all proper divisors $q$ of $p$.\n\nThe algorithmic solution is designed in three stages, as specified.\n\n**1. Bracketing of Roots**\nTo locate the potential supercycle parameters, we first identify intervals (brackets) that are guaranteed to contain a root of $g_{p}(r) = 0$. This is achieved by performing a systematic search over the parameter domain $r \\in [0,4]$. We define a dense grid of points $r_{i}$ spanning this interval with a fine step size, for instance, $\\Delta r = 10^{-4}$. For each period $p$ and for each pair of adjacent grid points $(r_{i}, r_{i+1})$, we evaluate the product $g_{p}(r_{i}) \\cdot g_{p}(r_{i+1})$. If this product is less than or equal to $0$, it signifies a sign change (or a root at one of the endpoints). By the IVT, the continuity of $g_{p}(r)$ guarantees the existence of at least one root $r^{\\star}$ in the interval $[r_{i}, r_{i+1}]$. All such brackets are collected for further processing.\n\n**2. Root Refinement**\nEach bracket $[a,b]$ obtained in the first stage is subjected to a high-precision root-finding algorithm. As suggested, we employ Brent's method, a robust and efficient bracketing algorithm that combines bisection, the secant method, and inverse quadratic interpolation. This method is guaranteed to converge provided that $g_{p}(a)$ and $g_{p}(b)$ have opposite signs. We configure the algorithm to refine each root $r^{\\star}$ until the width of the enclosing interval is less than a specified tolerance of $10^{-10}$, thereby ensuring the required accuracy for the parameter value. This process yields a set of candidate roots for each period $p$.\n\n**3. Primitivity Filtering and Final Selection**\nThe set of candidate roots found for $g_{p}(r) = 0$ includes all parameters for which $x_{\\mathrm{c}}=1/2$ has a period that divides $p$. To isolate the parameters corresponding to a *primitive* period $p$, we must filter out those for which $x_{\\mathrm{c}}=1/2$ has a shorter period $q$ (where $q$ is a proper divisor of $p$). For each candidate root $r^{\\star}$, we perform the following check:\nFor every proper divisor $q$ of $p$, we compute $g_{q}(r^{\\star})$. If $|g_{q}(r^{\\star})|$ is greater than the specified numerical tolerance of $10^{-12}$ for *all* proper divisors $q$, the root $r^{\\star}$ is confirmed to correspond to a primitive period-$p$ supercycle. Otherwise, it is discarded.\n\nAfter filtering, we are left with a set of parameters corresponding to primitive period-$p$ supercycles. The problem requires the smallest such parameter in the domain $(0,4]$. We therefore find the minimum value from this set of validated roots. This entire procedure is repeated for each specified period $p \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ to yield the final list of results. This method is systematic and grounded in fundamental numerical principles, ensuring a correct and verifiable solution.",

This is a standard topic in computational physics and nonlinear dynamics. All terms are mathematically defined with precision. The map $F_B$ is a deterministic function on a finite state space, which is a well-posed structure. The tasks are specific, objective, and computationally feasible. The problem does not violate any principles of scientific soundness or logical consistency. It is complete and unambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem comprises two tasks: a theoretical justification and a set of numerical computations.\n\n**Task 1: Justification of Eventual Periodicity**\n\nThe justification is a direct consequence of the finiteness of the state space $\\mathcal{G}_B$.\nFor a fixed precision parameter $B \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the grid size is $N = 2^B$. The state space is defined as $\\mathcal{G}_B = \\left\\{ \\frac{k}{N} \\,\\middle|\\, k \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,N\\} \\right\\}$. The number of distinct states in this set, its cardinality, is $|\\mathcal{G}_B| = N+1 = 2^B+1$. For any natural number $B$, this is a finite quantity.\n\nThe function $F_B$ is constructed to map the state space $\\mathcal{G}_B$ to itself, that is, $F_B: \\mathcal{G}_B \\to \\mathcal{G}_B$. For any initial state $x_0 \\in \\mathcal{G}_B$, the trajectory is an infinite sequence of states $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots$ where each $x_n = F_B(x_{n-1}) \\in \\mathcal{G}_B$.\n\nWe have an infinite sequence of states being drawn from a finite set of possibilities. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one state must be visited more than once. Let $x_j$ be the first state in the sequence that is a repetition of a previous state, say $x_i$, with $i  j$. Let this pair of indices $(i, j)$ be such that $i$ is minimized.\n\nThe sequence of states is therefore $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{i-1}, \\left(x_i, x_{i+1}, \\dots, x_{j-1}\\right), \\dots$.\nThe segment $x_0, \\dots, x_{i-1}$ is the transient part of the trajectory, having a finite length of $i$.\nThe segment $x_i, \\dots, x_{j-1}$ constitutes a cycle. Since the map $F_B$ is deterministic, the state $x_j=x_i$ will necessarily be followed by $x_{j+1} = F_B(x_j) = F_B(x_i) = x_{i+1}$, and the subsequent states will repeat in the same order. This establishes the periodic nature of the sequence after the transient part. The length of this cycle, which is the eventual period, is $\\lambda = j-i$.\n\nSince the existence of such indices $i$ and $j$ is guaranteed for any trajectory on a finite state space, every trajectory under $F_B$ is eventually periodic. This completes the justification.\n\n**Tasks 2  3: Computational Algorithm**\n\nTo compute the eventual period $\\lambda$, we must detect the cycle in the trajectory generated from a given initial condition. A robust and efficient method for this is Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also known as the \"tortoise and hare\" algorithm.\n\nTo ensure computational accuracy and avoid floating-point representation errors during the simulation, we reformulate the dynamics on the set of integers $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$. Each state $x_n \\in \\mathcal{G}_B$ is uniquely represented by an integer $k_n$ such that $x_n = k_n / N$. The map $F_B$ on fractions induces a corresponding integer map $f_B(k_n) = k_{n+1}$.\nStarting from $x_{n+1} = F_B(x_n)$, we substitute $x_n = k_n/N$ and $x_{n+1} = k_{n+1}/N$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{n+1}}{N} = Q_B\\left(4 \\frac{k_n}{N} \\left(1 - \\frac{k_n}{N}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{round}\\left(N \\cdot 4 \\frac{k_n}{N} \\frac{N-k_n}{N}\\right)}{N}\n$$\nThis gives the integer-based recurrence relation:\n$$\nk_{n+1} = f_B(k_n) = \\mathrm{round}\\left(\\frac{4 k_n (N-k_n)}{N}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\mathrm{round}(\\cdot)$ breaks ties by choosing the nearest even integer. The `numpy.round` function conforms to this standard.\n\nThe application of Floyd's algorithm to the sequence $k_0, k_1, k_2, \\dots$ generated by $k_{n+1} = f_B(k_n)$ proceeds in three standard phases:\n1.  **Collision Detection:** A \"tortoise\" pointer, advanced one step at a time, and a \"hare\" pointer, advanced two steps at a time, are initialized. They are guaranteed to eventually become equal at a state within the cycle.\n2.  **Cycle Start Identification:** One pointer is reset to the initial state $k_0$, while the other remains at the collision point. Both are then advanced one step at a time. Their next meeting point is the first state of the cycle, $k_\\mu$. The number of steps, $\\mu$, is the transient length.\n3.  **Period Calculation:** A pointer is advanced one step at a time starting from $k_\\mu$ until it returns to $k_\\mu$. The number of steps required is the cycle length, $\\lambda$.\n\nThis algorithm is implemented to solve for the test cases. For Cases A-C, the average of $\\lambda$ over the specified range of initial conditions is calculated. For Cases D-E, $\\lambda$ for a single initial condition is determined. The results are formatted as required.",
