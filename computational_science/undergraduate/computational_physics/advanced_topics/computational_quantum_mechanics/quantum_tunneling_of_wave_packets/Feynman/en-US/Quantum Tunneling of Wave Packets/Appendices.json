            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It describes a standard exercise in computational quantum dynamics, based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. All required parameters for a numerical solution are provided, and the definitions are consistent. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the one-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) for a given initial state and potential. In atomic units ($\\hbar=1$, $m=1$), the TDSE is:\n$$ \\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\,\\psi(x,t) \\;=\\; \\hat{H}\\psi(x,t) \\;=\\; \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V_{\\text{eff}}(x)\\right]\\psi(x,t) $$\nThe initial state at $t=0$ is a normalized Gaussian wave packet. The effective potential, $V_{\\text{eff}}(x)$, includes the real rectangular potential barrier $V(x)$ and an imaginary complex absorbing potential (CAP) $- \\mathrm{i}W(x)$ at the grid boundaries to prevent unphysical reflections.\n\nTo propagate the wave function $\\psi(x,t)$ in time, we employ the time-splitting spectral method. This method is highly suitable for this problem as it is accurate, stable, and computationally efficient. The formal solution over a small time step $\\Delta t$ involves the time-evolution operator $\\hat{U}(\\Delta t) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{H}\\Delta t)$. Since the kinetic energy operator, $\\hat{T} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$, and the potential energy operator, $\\hat{V}_{\\text{eff}} = V_{\\text{eff}}(x)$, do not commute, we use the second-order Strang splitting decomposition to approximate the evolution operator:\n$$ \\hat{U}(\\Delta t) \\approx e^{-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{V}_{\\text{eff}}\\Delta t/2} e^{-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{T}\\Delta t} e^{-\\mathrm{i}\\hat{V}_{\\text{eff}}\\Delta t/2} $$\nThis approximation has an error of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)$, providing sufficient accuracy for the specified parameters. The propagation from time $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ is performed in three steps:\n$1$. A half-step evolution under the potential $\\hat{V}_{\\text{eff}}$. In the position representation, this is a simple multiplication: $\\psi'(x) = e^{-\\mathrm{i}V_{\\text{eff}}(x)\\Delta t/2} \\psi(x,t)$.\n$2$. A full-step evolution under the kinetic operator $\\hat{T}$. This operation is computationally complex in position space but trivial in momentum space, where $\\hat{T}$ is a simple multiplication operator, $\\hat{T}_k = k^2/2$. We use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to switch between representations. The wave function is transformed to momentum space ($\\tilde{\\psi}'(k) = \\mathcal{F}[\\psi'(x)]$), multiplied by the kinetic evolution factor ($e^{-\\mathrm{i}k^2\\Delta t/2}$), and transformed back to position space ($\\psi''(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[e^{-\\mathrm{i}k^2\\Delta t/2}\\tilde{\\psi}'(k)]$).\n$3$. A second half-step evolution under the potential: $\\psi(x, t+\\Delta t) = e^{-\\mathrm{i}V_{\\text{eff}}(x)\\Delta t/2} \\psi''(x)$.\n\nThis three-step cycle is repeated from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\text{end}}$.\n\nThe simulation domain is discretized into a uniform spatial grid of $N=2048$ points over the interval $[x_{\\text{min}}, x_{\\text{max}}] = [-100, 100]$, with spacing $\\Delta x = (x_{\\text{max}}-x_{\\text{min}})/N$. The corresponding momentum-space (wavenumber) grid $k$ is constructed using the `fftfreq` utility, consistent with the FFT algorithm.\n\nThe initial wave packet is given by:\n$$ \\psi(x,0) \\;=\\; C \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right)\\exp(\\mathrm{i}k_0 x) $$\nwhere $C = (2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-1/4}$. Critically, for numerical work on a discrete grid, this function must be re-normalized to ensure that the total probability $\\int |\\psi(x,0)|^2 dx$, approximated by the sum $\\sum_j |\\psi(x_j,0)|^2 \\Delta x$, is exactly $1$.\n\nThe total effective potential is $V_{\\text{eff}}(x) = V(x) - \\mathrm{i}W(x)$.\nThe rectangular barrier is:\n$$ V(x) \\;=\\; \\begin{cases} V_0,  |x| \\le a/2 \\\\ 0,  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThe complex absorbing potential $W(x)$ is constructed to be non-zero only near the boundaries, within a width of $x_{\\text{cap}}=20$. As specified, $W(x) = \\eta s(x)^2$ with $\\eta=0.02$, where $s(x)$ is a function that ramps linearly from $0$ at the start of the absorbing region to $1$ at the grid boundary. For example, on the right boundary for $x \\in [x_{\\text{max}}-x_{\\text{cap}}, x_{\\text{max}}]$, $s(x) = \\frac{x-(x_{\\text{max}}-x_{\\text{cap}})}{x_{\\text{cap}}}$. This imaginary potential smoothly absorbs the outgoing wave function, preventing spurious reflections.\n\nThe transmission probability $T$ is determined by integrating the flux of probability current density past a probe. The probability current density is:\n$$ J(x,t) \\;=\\; \\Im\\!\\left(\\psi^*(x,t)\\,\\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,t)}{\\partial x}\\right) $$\nNumerically, the spatial derivative at the probe location $x_{\\text{probe}}$ is approximated using a centered finite difference on the grid:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\psi(x_j,t)}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{\\psi(x_{j+1},t) - \\psi(x_{j-1},t)}{2\\Delta x} $$\nwhere $x_j$ is the grid point closest to $x_{\\text{probe}}$. The transmission probability $T$ is the time integral of the positive-directed current at the probe location $x_{\\text{probe}} = a/2 + 10$:\n$$ T \\;\\approx\\; \\sum_{n=0}^{N_t-1} \\max(J(x_{\\text{probe}}, t_n), 0) \\cdot \\Delta t $$\nwhere $t_n = n\\Delta t$ and $N_t = T_{\\text{end}}/\\Delta t$. This summation is performed over the entire simulation time.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by initializing the grid, potentials, and the normalized wave packet. Then, the time-evolution loop propagates the wave function forward in time. At each step, the current density at the probe is calculated and its positive contribution is added to the integrated transmission probability. This procedure is repeated for each of the three test cases specified.",

Transform the wavefunction to Fourier space: $\\hat{\\psi}'(k,t) = \\mathcal{F}\\{\\psi'(x,t)\\}$.\n    b. Apply the kinetic evolution operator: $\\hat{\\psi}''(k,t) = e^{-i\\frac{k^2}{2}\\Delta t} \\hat{\\psi}'(k,t)$.\n    c. Transform back to position space: $\\psi''(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{\\psi}''(k,t)\\}$.\n    The efficiency of this split-step Fourier method derives from the FFT, which reduces the computational complexity of this step from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ for a grid of size $N$.\n\n3.  **Potential half-step:** Evolve again under the potential $\\hat{U}$ for $\\Delta t/2$:\n    $$\n    \\psi(x,t+\\Delta t) \\;=\\; e^{-i\\hat{U}(x)\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}} \\psi''(x,t)\n    $$\n\nThis three-step procedure constitutes the algorithm for one time step. To simulate up to a final time $T_\\text{final}$, this procedure is iterated $N_t = T_\\text{final}/\\Delta t$ times.\n\nThe transmission probability $\\mathcal{T}$ is estimated by calculating the total probability absorbed by the right CAP, $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{R}(T)$, and the left CAP, $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{L}(T)$. The total absorbed probability in the right CAP up to time $T$ is given by the integral:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_\\text{R}(T) \\;=\\; 2\\int_0^T \\!\\! dt \\int W_\\text{R}(x)\\,\\lvert \\psi(x,t)\\rvert^2\\,dx\n$$\nWe approximate this integral numerically. The time integral is approximated using a midpoint rule, which is consistent with the second-order accuracy of the Strang splitting. For each time step from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$, we use the 'mid-step' wavefunction, which we identify as the state $\\psi''(x,t)$ after the full kinetic step. The change in absorbed probability during one time step is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathcal{A}_\\text{R} \\approx 2\\,\\Delta t \\int W_\\text{R}(x)\\,\\lvert \\psi''(x,t)\\rvert^2\\,dx\n$$\nThe spatial integral is approximated by a sum over the discrete grid points $x_j$ with spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$:\n$$\n\\int W_\\text{R}(x)\\,\\lvert \\psi''(x,t)\\rvert^2\\,dx \\;\\approx\\; \\Delta x \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} W_\\text{R}(x_j)\\,\\lvert \\psi''(x_j,t)\\rvert^2\n$$\nThe total absorbed probabilities $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{R}(T_\\text{final})$ and $\\mathcal{A}_\\text{L}(T_\\text{final})$ are found by summing these contributions, $\\Delta \\mathcal{A}_\\text{R}$ and $\\Delta \\mathcal{A}_\\text{L}$, over all time steps. Finally, the transmission probability is calculated as the ratio:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T} \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{\\mathcal{A}_\\text{R}(T_\\text{final})}{\\mathcal{A}_\\text{L}(T_\\text{final})+\\mathcal{A}_\\text{R}(T_\\text{final})}\n$$\nThis ratio measures the fraction of the scattered wave packet that propagates to the right.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by first setting up the spatial grid and corresponding wavenumber grid. Then, for each test case, the initial state and potential functions ($V(x)$, $W_L(x)$, $W_R(x)$) are defined. The exponential operators for the potential and kinetic steps are pre-calculated. The simulation then loops through time, applying the split-step algorithm and accumulating the absorbed probabilities at each step. Finally, the transmission probability is computed and stored.",
