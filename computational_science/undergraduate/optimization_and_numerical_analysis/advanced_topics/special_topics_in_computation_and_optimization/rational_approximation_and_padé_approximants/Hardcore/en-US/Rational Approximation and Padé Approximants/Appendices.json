            "problem": "In the study of general relativity, the phenomenon of gravitational redshift describes how the frequency of a photon changes as it moves through a gravitational field. For a photon emitted with frequency $\\nu_e$ from the surface of a non-rotating, uncharged spherical body of mass $M$ and radius $R$, its frequency as measured by a distant observer (at infinity) is given by $\\nu_\\infty = \\nu_e \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFor weak gravitational fields, the dimensionless parameter $x = -\\frac{GM}{Rc^2}$ is small and positive. In this limit, the frequency ratio $f(x) = \\frac{\\nu_\\infty}{\\nu_e}$ can be conveniently approximated by a rational function. The $[L/M]$ Padé approximant is a rational function $R(x) = \\frac{P_L(x)}{Q_M(x)}$, where $P_L(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $L$ and $Q_M(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $M$. The coefficients of these polynomials are determined by matching the Maclaurin series of $R(x)$ to the Maclaurin series of $f(x)$ up to the highest possible order, $(L+M)$. A standard normalization condition is to set the constant term of the denominator polynomial, $Q_M(0)$, to 1.\n\nGiven the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{1+2x}$ that describes this frequency ratio, determine its $[1/1]$ Padé approximant centered at $x=0$.",
