            "introduction": "This first exercise provides a powerful physical analogy for the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. By framing the optimization as a particle settling to its lowest potential energy state on a constrained track, we can visualize the KKT conditions as a balance of forces. You will see how a boundary \"contact force\"—a proxy for the Lagrange multiplier—must perfectly oppose the force from the potential field (the objective's gradient) when the optimal point is pushed against an active constraint .",

            "problem": "A particle is constrained to move along the $x$-axis only within the closed interval $[0, 2]$. The particle is subject to a potential energy field described by the function $U(x) = (x-a)^2$, where the constant $a=5$. The particle will naturally settle at an equilibrium position $x^*$ within the interval that minimizes its potential energy.\n\nAt this equilibrium position, the force exerted by the potential field, defined as $F_{pot} = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$, is balanced by the forces exerted by the boundaries of the interval. A boundary exerts a non-zero \"contact\" force only when the particle is pressed against it.\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the contact force exerted by the active boundary on the particle at its equilibrium position $x^*$.",
            "solution": "The potential energy is $U(x)=(x-a)^{2}$ with $a=5$. The unconstrained equilibrium satisfies $F_{pot}=-\\frac{dU}{dx}=0$, which requires $\\frac{dU}{dx}=0$. Compute the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dx}=2(x-a)=2(x-5).\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{dU}{dx}=0$ gives $x=5$, which is not in the allowed interval $[0,2]$. On the interval $[0,2]$, since for $x\\in[0,2]$ one has $x-5<0$, it follows that\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dx}=2(x-5)<0,\n$$\nso $U(x)$ is strictly decreasing on $[0,2]$. Therefore, the constrained minimizer is at the right boundary:\n$$\nx^{*}=2.\n$$\nThe force from the potential is\n$$\nF_{pot}=-\\frac{dU}{dx}=-2(x-5)=10-2x.\n$$\nAt $x^{*}=2$,\n$$\nF_{pot}(2)=10-2\\cdot 2=6.\n$$\nAt equilibrium with an active boundary, the contact force $F_{c}$ from the boundary balances the potential force so that the net force is zero:\n$$\nF_{c}+F_{pot}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad F_{c}=-F_{pot}.\n$$\nHence the magnitude of the contact force is\n$$\n|F_{c}|=|F_{pot}(2)|=6.\n$$",

            "introduction": "Building on the one-dimensional case, this practice moves into two dimensions to explore what happens at a \"corner\" of a feasible region, where multiple constraints are active. You will project a point onto a rectangle, a task that geometrically illustrates why the negative gradient of the objective, $-\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}^*)$, must lie within the cone formed by the gradients of the active constraints.

            "problem": "A specialized sensor is mounted on a robotic arm that moves along a linear track. The position of the sensor is denoted by a single coordinate $x$, measured in meters.
