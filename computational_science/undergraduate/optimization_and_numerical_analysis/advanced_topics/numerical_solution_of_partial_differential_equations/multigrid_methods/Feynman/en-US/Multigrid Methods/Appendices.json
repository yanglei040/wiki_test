            "introduction": "To understand the power of multigrid methods, we must first master the art of communicating between different levels of detail—the fine and coarse grids. Let's begin with the fundamental operation of restriction: transferring information from a high-resolution fine grid to a lower-resolution coarse grid. This process is crucial for allowing the coarse grid to \"see\" and correct the large-scale, smooth components of the error that are difficult for standard iterative solvers to eliminate efficiently. This exercise  provides a concrete, hands-on application of the simplest restriction technique, known as injection, building your intuition for how fine-grid data is effectively down-sampled.",

            "problem": "In the context of multigrid methods for solving one-dimensional boundary value problems, we often need to transfer information between grids of different resolutions. Consider a fine uniform grid, $\\Omega_h$, on the interval $[0, 1]$ with 9 interior grid points. The values of a residual vector, $r_h$, at these interior points are given in order as:\n$$\nr_h = (1.2, 0.5, -0.8, 2.1, 0.0, -1.5, 3.3, 0.9, -2.4)^T\n$$\nNow, consider a coarse grid, $\\Omega_{2h}$, which is constructed by taking every second point from the fine grid $\\Omega_h$. This results in a coarse grid with 4 interior points.\n\nThe process of transferring the residual from the fine grid to the coarse grid is called restriction. We will use the simplest restriction operator, known as injection. In injection, the value of the residual at a coarse grid point is simply set to be the value of the residual at the corresponding coincident point on the fine grid.\n\nCalculate the residual vector, $r_{2h}$, on the 4 interior points of the coarse grid $\\Omega_{2h}$. Express your answer as a single row matrix containing the 4 components of the coarse grid residual vector in order.",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to compute the residual vector on a coarse grid by applying an injection restriction operator to a residual vector from a fine grid.\n\nLet the interior points of the fine grid $\\Omega_h$ be denoted by $x_i$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, 9$. The given fine-grid residual vector is $r_h$, where the $i$-th component, $(r_h)_i$, is the residual value at point $x_i$.\nSo, we have:\n$r_h(x_1) = 1.2$\n$r_h(x_2) = 0.5$\n$r_h(x_3) = -0.8$\n$r_h(x_4) = 2.1$\n$r_h(x_5) = 0.0$\n$r_h(x_6) = -1.5$\n$r_h(x_7) = 3.3$\n$r_h(x_8) = 0.9$\n$r_h(x_9) = -2.4$\n\nThe coarse grid, $\\Omega_{2h}$, is formed by taking every second point from the fine grid. This means the interior points of the coarse grid, let's call them $X_j$ for $j=1, 2, 3, 4$, coincide with the even-indexed points of the fine grid.\nSpecifically:\nThe first interior point of the coarse grid, $X_1$, coincides with the second interior point of the fine grid, $x_2$.\nThe second interior point of the coarse grid, $X_2$, coincides with the fourth interior point of the fine grid, $x_4$.\nThe third interior point of the coarse grid, $X_3$, coincides with the sixth interior point of the fine grid, $x_6$.\nThe fourth interior point of the coarse grid, $X_4$, coincides with the eighth interior point of the fine grid, $x_8$.\nIn general, the $j$-th coarse grid point $X_j$ corresponds to the fine grid point $x_{2j}$.\n\nThe restriction operator is injection. This means the value of the coarse-grid residual, $r_{2h}$, at a coarse grid point is simply the value of the fine-grid residual, $r_h$, at the same location.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nr_{2h}(X_j) = r_h(x_{2j})\n$$\n\nWe can now compute the components of the coarse-grid residual vector $r_{2h}$.\n\nFor the first component (at point $X_1$):\n$$\n(r_{2h})_1 = r_{2h}(X_1) = r_h(x_2) = 0.5\n$$\nThis is the 2nd component of the given $r_h$ vector.\n\nFor the second component (at point $X_2$):\n$$\n(r_{2h})_2 = r_{2h}(X_2) = r_h(x_4) = 2.1\n$$\nThis is the 4th component of the given $r_h$ vector.\n\nFor the third component (at point $X_3$):\n$$\n(r_{2h})_3 = r_{2h}(X_3) = r_h(x_6) = -1.5\n$$\nThis is the 6th component of the given $r_h$ vector.\n\nFor the fourth component (at point $X_4$):\n$$\n(r_{2h})_4 = r_{2h}(X_4) = r_h(x_8) = 0.9\n$$\nThis is the 8th component of the given $r_h$ vector.\n\nCombining these components in order, we get the coarse-grid residual vector:\n$$\nr_{2h} = (0.5, 2.1, -1.5, 0.9)^T\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for this vector to be presented as a single row matrix.",

            "introduction": "After a correction has been computed on the coarse grid, we need a way to bring this insight back to the fine grid to improve our solution. This \"up-sampling\" process is handled by a prolongation, or interpolation, operator. It takes the sparse correction values from the coarse grid and distributes them across the dense fine grid. This practice  demonstrates this critical step using linear interpolation, a widely used and intuitive method. By working through it, you will see how a few calculated values on a coarse level can generate a detailed correction that benefits the entire fine-grid solution.",

The interpolation is linear and defined as follows:\n1. For any fine-grid node $x_i$ that is also a coarse-grid node (i.e., $i$ is an even number), the value is directly injected: $e_h(x_i) = e_{2h}(x_i)$.\n2.

A robust and mathematically elegant answer is provided by the Galerkin principle, which constructs the coarse-grid operator, $A_{2h}$, directly from the fine-grid operator, $A_h$, and the transfer operators we've just practiced. The relationship is elegantly expressed as $A_{2h} = R A_h P$, where $R$ is the restriction and $P$ is the prolongation operator. This practice  guides you through this vital calculation and uncovers a non-intuitive result: even if $A_h$ is a simple matrix (like a tridiagonal one), the resulting $A_{2h}$ may be more complex, a fact that has important implications for multigrid implementation.",
