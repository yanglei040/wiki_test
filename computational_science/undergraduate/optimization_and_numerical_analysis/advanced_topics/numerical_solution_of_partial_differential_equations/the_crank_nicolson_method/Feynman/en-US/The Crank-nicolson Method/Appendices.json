            "problem": "A computational physicist is setting up a simulation to model the diffusion of a chemical dye in a long, thin, one-dimensional tube of length $L=5.0$ meters. The concentration of the dye, $u(x,t)$, is governed by the one-dimensional diffusion partial differential equation (PDE), $u_t = D u_{xx}$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The ends of the tube are connected to large reservoirs that maintain a zero concentration, leading to the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0$.\n\nAt the beginning of the experiment, $t=0$, a unit amount of dye is injected precisely at the location $x_0 = 3.6$ meters. This initial state is mathematically modeled as a Dirac delta function: $u(x,0) = \\delta(x-x_0)$.\n\nTo solve the PDE numerically, the spatial domain $[0, L]$ is discretized into $N=125$ equal subintervals. The grid points are denoted by $x_j = j \\Delta x$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N$. The state of the system at any time is represented by a vector of concentrations at the interior grid points. The initial state is therefore a vector $\\mathbf{u}^0$, where the component $u_j^0$ represents the concentration $u(x_j, 0)$.\n\nTo properly represent the instantaneous injection, the physicist decides to assign a non-zero concentration value to only the single grid point corresponding to the injection location $x_0$, while setting all other interior grid points to zero. The value of this non-zero concentration must be chosen such that the total amount of dye in the discrete system is the same as the total amount in the continuous system (which is 1, by the property of the delta function).\n\nDetermine the numerical value of this single non-zero component in the initial state vector $\\mathbf{u}^0$.
