The goal is to find a single unknown coefficient in a trial function that approximates the solution to a boundary value problem. By substituting our trial function into the differential equation and forcing the resulting error, or 'residual,' to be zero at a single point, we can solve for our approximation. This core procedure  is the foundation upon which all collocation techniques are built.",
