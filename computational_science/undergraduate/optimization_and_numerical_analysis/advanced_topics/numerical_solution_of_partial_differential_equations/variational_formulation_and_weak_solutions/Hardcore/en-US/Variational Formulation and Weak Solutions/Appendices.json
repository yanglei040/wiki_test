This exercise  uses the physically intuitive model of a taut string under a concentrated point load to guide you through this derivation. It powerfully illustrates how the weak form naturally accommodates source terms, like the Dirac delta function, that are challenging to handle in the classical sense.",

            "problem": "Consider a simplified model for the static vertical displacement, $u(x)$, of a taut, elastic string stretched along the x-axis from $x=0$ to $x=1$. The string is fixed at both ends, so its displacement is zero at the endpoints. A concentrated point-like force is applied at the midpoint of the string, located at $x=1/2$.\n\nThe governing equation for the displacement $u(x)$ is the one-dimensional Poisson equation given by the following boundary value problem (strong form):\n$$ -u''(x) = f(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0, 1) $$\nwith boundary conditions $u(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 0$. The source term $f(x)$ representing the concentrated force is modeled by the Dirac delta function, $f(x) = \\delta(x-1/2)$.\n\nThe weak formulation of this problem seeks a solution $u$ in a function space $V$ such that an integral equation holds for all test functions $v$ from the same space $V$. For this problem, the appropriate space is the Sobolev space $H_0^1(0,1)$, which consists of functions that are square-integrable, have square-integrable first derivatives, and satisfy the boundary conditions $v(0)=0$ and $v(1)=0$.\n\nWhich of the following represents the correct weak formulation for this problem?\n\nA.

            "introduction": "Having established the weak form, we must understand the properties of the functions involved, particularly the nature of the weak derivative.

            "problem": "In the study of partial differential equations and numerical analysis, the concept of a weak derivative is used to extend the notion of differentiation to functions that are not classically differentiable, such as those that are not continuous. We consider functions in the space $L^2(0,1)$, which is the set of all functions $f(x)$ defined on the interval $(0,1)$ for which the integral $\\int_0^1 |f(x)|^2 \\,dx$ is finite.\n\nA function $v \\in L^2(0,1)$ is defined as the weak derivative of a function $u \\in L^2(0,1)$ if the following identity holds for every \"test function\" $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(0,1)$:\n$$ \\int_0^1 u(x) \\phi'(x) \\,dx = - \\int_0^1 v(x) \\phi(x) \\,dx $$\nHere, $C_c^\\infty(0,1)$ represents the set of all infinitely differentiable functions that are equal to zero outside some closed subinterval of $(0,1)$. A key property of these test functions is that they are zero at the boundaries, i.e., $\\phi(0) = \\phi(1) = 0$.\n\nNow, consider the specific function $u(x)$ defined on the interval $(0,1)$ as:\n$$ u(x) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{if } 0  x  1/2 \\\\ 1  \\text{if } 1/2 \\le x  1 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function has a jump discontinuity at $x = 1/2$ and is an element of $L^2(0,1)$. It is a fundamental result that this function $u(x)$ does not possess a weak derivative that is also in $L^2(0,1)$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate reason for this fact?\n\nA. The function $u(x)$ is not in $L^2(0,1)$ because of its discontinuity, so the concept of a weak derivative is not applicable.\n\nB. The integral $\\int_0^1 u(x) \\phi'(x) \\,dx$ is mathematically undefined because $u(x)$ is not continuous.\n\nC. The test functions $\\phi(x) \\in C_c^\\infty(0,1)$ are not guaranteed to be in $L^2(0,1)$, making the integrals in the definition of the weak derivative invalid.\n\nD. Applying integration by parts to the term $\\int_0^1 u(x) \\phi'(x) \\,dx$ reveals a dependency on the value of the test function at the point of discontinuity, $\\phi(1/2)$, which cannot be produced by the integral of any single function $v \\in L^2(0,1)$ against $\\phi(x)$.\n\nE. The classical derivative of $u(x)$ is zero almost everywhere, which implies its weak derivative must be the zero function in $L^2(0,1)$.

But the evaluation functional $\\phi \\mapsto \\phi\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ is not continuous on $L^{2}(0,1)$. To see this, choose a fixed $\\eta \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}((-1,1))$ with $\\eta(0)=1$ and define\n$$\n\\phi_{n}(x)=\\eta\\!\\left(n\\left(x-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\right).\n$$\nThen $\\phi_{n} \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(0,1)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, $\\phi_{n}\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)=\\eta(0)=1$, and\n$$\n\\|\\phi_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(0,1)}^{2}=\\int_{0}^{1} \\left|\\eta\\!\\left(n\\left(x-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)\\right|^{2}\\,dx=\\frac{1}{n}\\int_{-1}^{1} |\\eta(y)|^{2}\\,dy \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } n \\to \\infty.\n$$\nThus $|\\phi_{n}\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)|=1$ while $\\|\\phi_{n}\\|_{2} \\to 0$, contradicting any inequality of the form $|\\phi\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)| \\le C\\|\\phi\\|_{2}$. Therefore no $v \\in L^{2}(0,1)$ can satisfy $\\int v\\phi=\\phi\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ for all $\\phi \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(0,1)$.\n\nThis shows that $u$ has no weak derivative in $L^{2}(0,1)$. Interpreted distributionally, the weak derivative is the Dirac measure at $\\tfrac{1}{2}$, which is not an $L^{2}$ function. Consequently, among the options, D is the accurate reason.\n\nFor completeness, we note that:\n- B is false because $\\int_{0}^{1} u\\,\\phi'$ is well-defined (indeed, computed above).\n- C is false because every $\\phi \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(0,1)$ belongs to $L^{2}(0,1)$.\n- E is false: while the classical derivative of $u$ is zero almost everywhere, the weak derivative accounts for the jump via a distributional term; it is not the zero function in $L^{2}(0,1)$.",
