The temperatures at the ends of the rod are fixed, imposing the boundary conditions:\n$$T(0) = 1$$\n$$T(\\pi) = -3$$\nA researcher proposes that the temperature distribution along the rod is described by the function:\n$$f(x) = \\cos(x) + 2\\sin(x)$$\nDetermine whether the researcher's proposed function $f(x)$ is a valid solution for this boundary value problem (BVP).
