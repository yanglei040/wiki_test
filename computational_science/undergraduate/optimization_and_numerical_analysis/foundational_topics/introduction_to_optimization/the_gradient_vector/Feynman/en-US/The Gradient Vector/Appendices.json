The components of the gradient vector, $\\nabla T$, are the partial derivatives of the function $T$ with respect to each coordinate. This exercise  directly tests this concept by asking you to find a point on a hypothetical temperature field where the rates of change along the $x$- and $y$-axes have specific values. Solving this will reinforce the connection between the abstract gradient vector and the tangible, directional rates of change.",

            "introduction": "Having established that the gradient's components describe rates of change along the axes, we now turn to the significance of the vector as a whole. A key property of the gradient is that its magnitude, $|\\nabla f|$, represents the maximum possible rate of change of the function $f$ at a given point. This practice problem  challenges you to apply this principle by comparing the maximum rates of change for two different physical fields—temperature and pressure—at a specific location.
