            "introduction": "Many optimization problems involve finding a single best point in space. This exercise provides a classic example of unconstrained optimization, where we seek to find the ideal location for a central hub to minimize a cost function related to transportation . By framing the cost as the sum of squared Euclidean distances, a common and mathematically convenient objective, the problem becomes elegantly solvable using fundamental concepts from multivariate calculus, revealing the optimal location's connection to a simple statistical measure.",

For planning purposes, the locations of the retail stores are mapped onto a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. The company's operations research team has determined that the optimal location for the hub is the one that minimizes the sum of the squared Euclidean distances to each of the four stores. This criterion is chosen to minimize a cost function that is quadratically dependent on delivery distance.\n\nThe coordinates of the four retail stores are given as:\nStore A: $(1, 8)$\nStore B: $(5, 2)$\nStore C: $(-3, 4)$\nStore D: $(9, 0)$\n\nLet the coordinates of the new hub be $(x, y)$.

This problem introduces the crucial concept of constrained optimization, where the goal is to maximize a desired outcome subject to a fixed constraint .

            "problem": "A student is preparing for final exams in two subjects: Quantum Mechanics and Organic Chemistry. They have a total of $T$ hours available to study for both exams. The student has developed a model for their expected grade in each subject based on the number of hours dedicated to studying it. The grades are measured on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nFor Quantum Mechanics, the expected grade $G_Q(t_Q)$ is given by the function:\n$G_Q(t_Q) = G_{Q,0} + A_Q \\sqrt{t_Q}$\nwhere $t_Q$ is the number of hours spent studying Quantum Mechanics, $G_{Q,0}$ is the baseline grade with zero study hours, and $A_Q$ is a coefficient representing the effectiveness of studying.\n\nFor Organic Chemistry, the expected grade $G_C(t_C)$ is similarly given by:\n$G_C(t_C) = G_{C,0} + A_C \\sqrt{t_C}$\nwhere $t_C$ is the number of hours spent studying Organic Chemistry, $G_{C,0}$ is the baseline grade, and $A_C$ is the study effectiveness coefficient.\n\nThe student's objective is to allocate the total study time $T$ between the two subjects to maximize their average grade across both exams.

This \"minimax\" approach is vital in fields like safety engineering and network design, where ensuring a baseline level of performance everywhere is critical .
