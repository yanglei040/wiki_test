This practice  demonstrates how to solve a lower triangular system using forward substitution. Understanding this simple, sequential process is essential, as it forms a critical building block for more sophisticated algorithms like LU decomposition, which aim to transform complex systems into this solvable form.",

The LU factorization is a powerful direct method that decomposes a general matrix $A$ into a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$, allowing us to solve $Ax=b$ as two separate triangular systems.

By observing the outcome of the algorithm, you will gain a practical understanding of how a matrix's theoretical properties, such as linear dependence between its columns, manifest during numerical computation.",
