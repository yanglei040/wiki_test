This first exercise walks you through a single step of the BDF1 method, also known as the backward Euler method, for a simple ordinary differential equation. By calculating the result and comparing it to the exact solution, you will gain a concrete feel for the mechanics of implicit methods and see how numerical error is introduced from the very first step.

The first-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF1), also known as the backward Euler method, is an implicit method defined by the general recurrence relation:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the constant step size, $y_n$ is the numerical approximation of $y(t_n)$, and $f(t, y) = y'(t)$.\n\nLet the initial point be $(t_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$.

For multistep methods like BDFs, a key prerequisite for convergence is a property called 'zero-stability', which ensures that small, unavoidable errors are not catastrophically amplified. This practice challenges you to verify the zero-stability of the popular BDF2 method by analyzing the roots of its characteristic polynomial, a fundamental skill in numerical analysis. ",
