This exercise explores a scenario where this core assumption fails, revealing a fundamental limitation of the method.

The method's guarantee of convergence is local, meaning it is only assured if the initial guess is \"sufficiently close\" to the true minimum.

            "introduction": "Moving from theoretical limitations to practical realities, we consider the impact of finite-precision computer arithmetic. In theory, Newton's method finds the minimum of a simple quadratic function in a single step. This problem  simulates a computer with limited precision to demonstrate a subtle but crucial drawback: due to rounding or truncation, the algorithm may stall in a \"stalling interval\" around the true minimum, where the machine-computed gradient becomes zero, thus halting progress prematurely.",

            "problem": "In theory, Newton's method for optimization is remarkably efficient for quadratic functions. For a general one-dimensional quadratic function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}ax^2 + bx + c$ (with $a>0$), the method converges to the exact minimizer in a single iterative step, regardless of the starting point.\n\nHowever, in practice, the finite precision of computer arithmetic can introduce artifacts that prevent the algorithm from performing as expected. Consider the task of minimizing the function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - (\\ln 10) x$ using a hypothetical computer. The true minimum of this function occurs at $x^* = \\ln 10$.\n\nThis computer has the following specifications: it represents all numbers and performs all arithmetic using a base-10 floating-point system that maintains 5 significant figures. To handle numbers that require more than 5 significant figures, the computer uses 'chopping' (i.e., it simply truncates any digits beyond the fifth significant figure). For this problem, use the approximation $\\ln 10 \\approx 2.30258509...$.\n\nThe optimization program, an implementation of Newton's method, is designed to stop when the machine-computed value of the gradient, $g'(x)$, is exactly zero. Due to the chopping behavior, there exists a continuous interval of real numbers $I = [x_{\\text{low}}, x_{\\text{high}})$ such that for any point $x \\in I$, the floating-point representation of $x$ is identical to the floating-point representation of the true minimum, $x^*$. This causes the machine-computed gradient to be zero for any $x$ in this interval, stalling the algorithm prematurely.\n\nCalculate the width of this \"stalling interval\", defined as $x_{\\text{high}} - x_{\\text{low}}$. Provide your answer as a single numerical value.",
            "solution": "We consider the function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - (\\ln 10)\\,x$ with derivative $g'(x) = x - \\ln 10$. On the given computer, all numbers are represented in base-10 floating-point with $t=5$ significant digits using chopping. Let $\\operatorname{fl}(\\cdot)$ denote the floating-point mapping by chopping to $t=5$ significant digits.\n\nThe optimization program stops when the machine-computed gradient is exactly zero. With floating-point operations, $g'(x)$ is computed as $\\operatorname{fl}(\\operatorname{fl}(x) - \\operatorname{fl}(\\ln 10))$. In base-10 floating-point without exponent limits and with chopping, the only way this equals exactly zero is when the two operands of the subtraction are exactly equal in floating-point, that is,\n$$\n\\operatorname{fl}(x) = \\operatorname{fl}(\\ln 10).\n$$\n\nTherefore, the stalling interval $I$ is precisely the preimage under $\\operatorname{fl}$ of the single floating-point number $\\operatorname{fl}(\\ln 10)$. For a positive normalized floating-point number $y$ with $t$ significant digits in base $10$, written as $y = m \\times 10^{e}$ with $1 \\le m  10$, the set of real numbers that chop to $y$ is the half-open interval\n$$\n[y, y + \\operatorname{ulp}(y)),\n$$\nwhere the spacing to the next representable number is\n$$\n\\operatorname{ulp}(y) = 10^{e - (t-1)}.\n$$\nThis follows because increasing the last (the $t$-th) significant digit of $m$ by one changes $y$ by $10^{e-(t-1)}$.\n\nWe compute $\\operatorname{fl}(\\ln 10)$ using $t=5$ digits and chopping. Since $\\ln 10 \\approx 2.30258509\\ldots$ and chopping to $5$ significant digits yields\n$$\n\\operatorname{fl}(\\ln 10) = 2.3025 \\times 10^{0},\n$$\nwe have $e=0$. Hence,\n$$\n\\operatorname{ulp}(\\operatorname{fl}(\\ln 10)) = 10^{0 - (5-1)} = 10^{-4}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nI = [2.3025, 2.3025 + 10^{-4})\n= [2.3025, 2.3026),\n$$\nand the width of the stalling interval is\n$$x_{\\text{high}} - x_{\\text{low}} = 10^{-4}.$$",
