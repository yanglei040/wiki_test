This process, known as linear regression, is fundamental in science and engineering for modeling relationships between variables. This first practice  walks you through a classic scenario of sensor calibration, where you will not only determine the model parameters by setting up and solving the normal equations but also quantify the \"goodness of fit\" by calculating the norm of the residual vector.",
