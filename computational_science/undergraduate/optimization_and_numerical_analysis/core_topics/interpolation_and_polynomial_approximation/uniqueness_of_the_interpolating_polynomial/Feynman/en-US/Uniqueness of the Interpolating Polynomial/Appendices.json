            "introduction": "Let's begin by building an interpolating polynomial from the ground up. This exercise demonstrates the constructive nature of polynomial interpolation, showing how a unique linear model for two points is superseded by a unique quadratic model when a third, non-collinear point is introduced. By working through this process, you will gain a concrete understanding of why the degree of the unique interpolating polynomial, guaranteed to be of degree at most $n$ for $n+1$ points, must increase to accommodate new information.

A unique linear polynomial, denoted as $p_1(x)$, is constructed such that it passes through both points $A$ and $B$.\n\nSubsequently, a third data point, $C = (4, 15)$, is introduced. It is observed that this point does not lie on the line defined by $p_1(x)$. To accommodate this new information, a unique quadratic polynomial, denoted as $p_2(x)$, is constructed that passes through all three points: $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nYour task is to determine the resulting quadratic polynomial $p_2(x)$ and to quantify the difference in the y-intercepts of the two polynomials. Specifically, you must:\n1.  Find the analytical expression for the quadratic polynomial $p_2(x)$ in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$.\n2.
