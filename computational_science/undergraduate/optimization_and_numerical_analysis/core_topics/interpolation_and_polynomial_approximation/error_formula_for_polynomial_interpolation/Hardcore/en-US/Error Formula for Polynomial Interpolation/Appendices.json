We'll begin with a scenario that allows for a direct and exact calculation of the interpolation error. By interpolating a polynomial with another polynomial of a lower degree, the higher-order derivative in the error formula becomes a constant, which eliminates the ambiguity of the unknown point $\\xi$ and lets us see the formula work with perfect clarity .",

            "problem": "In numerical analysis, the error of polynomial interpolation of a function $f(x)$ using nodes $x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ is closely related to the nodal polynomial, defined as $\\omega(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n} (x - x_i)$. Specifically, the interpolation error $E(x)$ is given by $E(x) = \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\\xi)}{(n+1)!} \\omega(x)$ for some $\\xi$ in the interval containing the nodes.\n\nTo minimize the overall interpolation error, a common strategy is to choose the nodes in a way that minimizes the maximum absolute value of the nodal polynomial, $\\max|\\omega(x)|$, over the interpolation interval.\n\nConsider a quadratic interpolation ($n=2$) on the interval $[-1, 2]$. The two boundary points, $x_0 = -1$ and $x_2 = 2$, are chosen as fixed nodes. You have the freedom to choose the location of the third node, $x_1 = a$, at any point strictly between the boundaries, i.e., $a \\in (-1, 2)$.\n\nDetermine the value of $a$ that minimizes the maximum absolute value of the nodal polynomial, $\\max_{x \\in [-1, 2]} |\\omega(x)|$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to find the value of $a \\in (-1, 2)$ that minimizes the quantity $M(a) = \\max_{x \\in [-1, 2]} |\\omega(x)|$, where the nodal polynomial $\\omega(x)$ is given by the nodes $x_0 = -1$, $x_1 = a$, and $x_2 = 2$.\n\nThe nodal polynomial is:\n$$\n\\omega(x) = (x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_2) = (x + 1)(x - a)(x - 2)\n$$\nThe optimization problem is to solve:\n$$\n\\min_{a \\in (-1, 2)} \\left( \\max_{x \\in [-1, 2]} |(x + 1)(x - a)(x - 2)| \\right)\n$$\nThe problem is set on an asymmetric interval $[-1, 2]$. It is often simpler to analyze such problems on the symmetric interval $[-1, 1]$. We can achieve this by using an affine transformation that maps a new variable $t \\in [-1, 1]$ to our original variable $x \\in [-1, 2]$.\n\nLet the transformation be $x(t) = mt + b$. We need to find the constants $m$ and $b$. We map the endpoints of the intervals:\n- When $t = -1$, we want $x = -1$: $-1 = m(-1) + b \\implies -1 = -m + b$.\n- When $t = 1$, we want $x = 2$: $2 = m(1) + b \\implies 2 = m + b$.\n\nThis is a system of two linear equations. Adding the two equations gives:\n$$\n(-1) + 2 = (-m + b) + (m + b) \\implies 1 = 2b \\implies b = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting $b = 1/2$ into the second equation gives:\n$$\n2 = m + \\frac{1}{2} \\implies m = 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nSo the transformation is $x(t) = \\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we transform the nodal polynomial $\\omega(x)$ into a new polynomial in the variable $t$.\nThe factors of $\\omega(x)$ become:\n$$\nx + 1 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(t + 1)\n$$\n$$\nx - 2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 2 = \\frac{3}{2}t - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(t - 1)\n$$\nThe middle node $x_1=a$ must also be transformed. Let $a'$ be the corresponding point in the $t$-domain for the node $a$ in the $x$-domain. The transformation applies to the nodes as well:\n$$\na = \\frac{3}{2}a' + \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThen the factor $(x-a)$ becomes:\n$$\nx - a = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{2}a' + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}(t - a')\n$$\nThe nodal polynomial in terms of $t$ is:\n$$\n\\omega(x(t)) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(t + 1)\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(t - a')\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(t - 1)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 (t+1)(t-1)(t-a')\n$$\nLet's call the nodal polynomial in the $t$-domain $\\omega_t(t')$.\n$$\n\\omega_t(t) = (t+1)(t-1)(t-a') = (t^2 - 1)(t - a')\n$$\nThe maximization problem is now over the interval $t \\in [-1, 1]$:\n$$\n\\max_{x \\in [-1, 2]} |\\omega(x)| = \\max_{t \\in [-1, 1]} \\left| \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 \\omega_t(t) \\right| = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 \\max_{t \\in [-1, 1]} |\\omega_t(t)|\n$$\nTo solve the original problem, we need to find the value of $a'$ that minimizes $\\max_{t \\in [-1, 1]} |\\omega_t(t)|$.\nThe function $\\omega_t(t)$ is a cubic polynomial with roots at $-1, a', 1$. Its local extrema lie between these roots. For the maximum absolute value to be minimized, the magnitudes of the two local extrema must be equal.\n\nLet's analyze the function $\\omega_t(t, a') = (t^2 - 1)(t - a')$.\nThe function $t^2-1$ is an even function of $t$. The term $t-a'$ controls the symmetry of the product.\nIf we choose $a' = 0$, the function becomes $\\omega_t(t, 0) = t(t^2-1) = t^3 - t$. This is an odd function.\nThe local extrema of an odd function symmetric about the origin (as this one is) will have equal and opposite values, meaning their absolute values are equal. To find these extrema, we compute the derivative and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(t^3 - t) = 3t^2 - 1 = 0 \\implies t = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThe values at these extrema are:\n$\\omega_t(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})^3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = -\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$\n$\\omega_t(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})^3 - (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = -\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$\nThe magnitudes are indeed equal.\n\nIf we choose $a' \\neq 0$, the symmetry is broken. For example, if $a' > 0$, the root at $a'$ shifts to the right. This will cause the local minimum (between $-1$ and $a'$) to become larger in magnitude, while the local maximum (between $a'$ and $1$) becomes smaller in magnitude. Thus, the maximum of the two magnitudes will be larger than for the $a'=0$ case. A symmetric argument holds for $a'<0$. Therefore, the minimum of the maximum absolute values of $\\omega_t(t)$ is achieved when $a'=0$.\n\nThe optimal value for the transformed node is $a' = 0$.\nNow we transform this value back to the original $x$-domain to find the optimal $a$.\nUsing the relation $a = \\frac{3}{2}a' + \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\na = \\frac{3}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, the optimal placement of the middle node is at $a = 1/2$.",
