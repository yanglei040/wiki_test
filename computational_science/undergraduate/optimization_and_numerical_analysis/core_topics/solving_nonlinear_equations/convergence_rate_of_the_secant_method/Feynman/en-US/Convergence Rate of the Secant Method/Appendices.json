At each step $k$, a new approximation $c_k$ is computed using the endpoints of the current interval, $[a_k, b_k]$, with the same formula as Method S:\n$$c_k = b_k - f(b_k) \\frac{b_k - a_k}{f(b_k) - f(a_k)}$$\nThe next interval, $[a_{k+1}, b_{k+1}]$, is then chosen to be either $[a_k, c_k]$ or $[c_k, b_k]$ to ensure that the condition $f(a_{k+1})f(b_{k+1}) < 0$ is maintained, thus always bracketing the root.\n\nBoth methods are applied to find the single real root of the function $f(x) = \\exp(x) - 10$.

            "solution": "We consider $f(x)=\\exp(x)-10$, which has a single real root $x^*$ satisfying $f(x^*)=0$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing and strictly convex on $\\mathbb{R}$, we have\n$$f'(x)=\\exp(x)>0,\\qquad f''(x)=\\exp(x)>0,$$\nand the root is $x^*=\\ln(10)$.\n\nMethod S (secant method) with initial points $x_0=0$ and $x_1=3$ generates\n$$x_{k+1}=x_k-f(x_k)\\frac{x_k-x_{k-1}}{f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})},\\quad k\\ge 1.$$\nUnder the standard assumptions that $f\\in C^2$ near $x^*$ and $f'(x^*)\\neq 0$, and assuming the iterates converge to $x^*$ (as stipulated), the secant method is known to converge with superlinear order $p$ satisfying $p^2-p-1=0$, hence\n$$p=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$$\nTherefore, Method S exhibits superlinear convergence.\n\nMethod R (regula falsi/false position) starts with $[a_0,b_0]=[0,3]$ with $f(a_0)f(b_0)<0$. At step $k$ it computes\n$$c_k=b_k-f(b_k)\\frac{b_k-a_k}{f(b_k)-f(a_k)},$$\nand selects $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}]$ to preserve a sign change. For a strictly convex, strictly increasing $f$ with $f(a_k)<0<f(b_k)$, the chord through $(a_k,f(a_k))$ and $(b_k,f(b_k))$ lies above the graph of $f$ on $[a_k,b_k]$. If $\\ell_k(x)$ denotes this chord, then $f(x)\\le \\ell_k(x)$ for $x\\in[a_k,b_k]$. At the x-intercept $c_k$ of the chord, $\\ell_k(c_k)=0$, hence $f(c_k)\\le 0$, and strict convexity yields $f(c_k)<0$. Because $f$ is strictly increasing and $f(x^*)=0$, this implies $c_k<x^*$. Therefore the next interval is $[a_{k+1},b_{k+1}]=[c_k,b_k]$, so $b_{k+1}=b_k$. By induction, $b_k=b_0=3$ for all $k$, and $a_k \\nearrow x^*$.\n\nTo determine the rate, define the error $e_k=x^*-a_k>0$. Using $b_k\\equiv b_0$ and the update,\n$$c_k=b_0-f(b_0)\\frac{b_0-a_k}{f(b_0)-f(a_k)},$$\nand a first-order Taylor expansion at $x^*$,\n$$f(a_k)=f'(x^*)(a_k-x^*)+o(|a_k-x^*|) = -f'(x^*)e_k+o(e_k),$$\nwe obtain, after algebraic manipulation,\n$$e_{k+1}=x^*-c_k=\\left(1-\\frac{f'(x^*)(b_0-x^*)}{f(b_0)}\\right)e_k+o(e_k).$$\nConvexity implies $f(b_0)>f'(x^*)(b_0-x^*)$, so the coefficient\n$$\\rho=1-\\frac{f'(x^*)(b_0-x^*)}{f(b_0)}$$\nsatisfies $0<\\rho<1$.
