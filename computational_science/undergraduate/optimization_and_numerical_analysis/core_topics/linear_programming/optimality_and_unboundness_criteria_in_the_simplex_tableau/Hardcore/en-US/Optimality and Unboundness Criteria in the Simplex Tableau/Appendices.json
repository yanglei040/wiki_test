            "introduction": "The core of the simplex method is an iterative process of moving from one basic feasible solution to a better one. This practice focuses on the fundamental decision at each step: determining if the current solution is optimal. If it is not, you must correctly identify the entering and leaving variables to proceed to the next, improved solution, a process this exercise  is designed to test. Mastering this step is essential for executing the simplex algorithm and provides a clear distinction between a problem that is simply not yet optimal and one that is unbounded.",

            "problem": "A student is using the simplex method to solve a Linear Programming (LP) maximization problem. The decision variables are $x_1$ and $x_2$, and the slack variables are $s_1$ and $s_2$. After several iterations, the student arrives at the following simplex tableau, where Row 0 represents the objective function $Z$.\n\n| Basic Variable | $Z$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | RHS |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: |\n| $Z$ | 1 | -3 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 50 |\n| $x_2$ | 0 | -1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 10 |\n| $s_2$ | 0 |  2 | 0 | -1 | 1 | 20 |\n\nBased on this tableau, the student needs to determine the next step or the status of the problem. Which of the following statements is the correct conclusion?\n\nA. The problem is not optimal, and the next pivot operation can be performed by choosing $x_1$ as the entering variable and $s_2$ as the leaving variable.\n\nB. The problem is unbounded because the column corresponding to the entering variable $x_1$ contains a negative entry.\n\nC. The current basic feasible solution is optimal.\n\nD. The problem is not optimal, and the next pivot operation should select $s_1$ as the entering variable.\n\nE. The problem is unbounded because all coefficients in the column of the entering variable $x_1$ are non-positive.",
            "solution": "Interpret the tableau as the system of equations in canonical form, with the basic variables on the left and nonbasic variables on the right-hand side:\n- Row 0 (objective): $Z - 3x_{1} + 2s_{1} = 50$.\n- Row 1 (basic $x_{2}$): $x_{2} - x_{1} + s_{1} = 10$.\n- Row 2 (basic $s_{2}$): $s_{2} + 2x_{1} - s_{1} = 20$.\n\nThe current basic feasible solution sets the nonbasic variables to zero, so $x_{1} = 0$ and $s_{1} = 0$. Then $x_{2} = 10$, $s_{2} = 20$, and $Z = 50$.\n\nOptimality test for a maximization problem: the current solution is optimal if and only if all reduced costs in Row 0 for nonbasic variables are nonnegative. The coefficient under $x_{1}$ in Row 0 is $-3  0$, so the solution is not optimal. Therefore, $x_{1}$ is a valid entering variable since increasing $x_{1}$ will increase $Z$ (from $Z = 50 + 3x_{1} - 2s_{1}$ with $s_{1} = 0$).\n\nTo determine the leaving variable, apply the minimum ratio test on the $x_{1}$ column using only rows with positive coefficients in that column:\n- In the $x_{2}$ row, the coefficient of $x_{1}$ is $-1 \\leq 0$, so it is not eligible for the ratio test.\n- In the $s_{2}$ row, the coefficient of $x_{1}$ is $2 > 0$, so compute the ratio $\\frac{\\text{RHS}}{\\text{coefficient}} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, $s_{2}$ is the leaving variable, and the pivot is at the $(s_{2}, x_{1})$ position.\n\nUnboundedness check: a maximization problem is unbounded in the chosen entering column only if all the coefficients in that column (in the constraint rows) are less than or equal to zero. Here, the $x_{1}$ column contains a positive coefficient ($2$ in the $s_{2}$ row), so the problem is not unbounded for this entering variable. Therefore, statements asserting unboundedness (B and E) are false. Statement D is incorrect because $s_{1}$ has a positive coefficient ($2$) in Row 0, so it cannot improve the objective in a maximization step.\n\nHence, the correct conclusion is that the problem is not yet optimal, and the next pivot should use $x_{1}$ as entering and $s_{2}$ as leaving.",

            "introduction": "While iterating towards an optimal solution, the simplex algorithm can also detect special cases, such as when a linear programming problem is unbounded. An unbounded problem is one where the objective function can be increased or decreased indefinitely without violating any constraints.

            "solution": "We consider a maximization linear program in standard form being solved by the simplex method. The tableau has the objective equation transformed by pivoting. By the problem's convention, the coefficient of each non-basic variable $x_j$ in row 0 is equal to its reduced cost. Let this be $r_k$ for variable $x_k$. By the problem’s convention, optimality holds when all reduced costs of non-basic variables are non-negative, so a negative reduced cost indicates a potential entering variable that can improve $z$.\n\nWrite the current dictionary in canonical form. Let $B$ denote the current basis, $N$ the non-basic column set, and $\\bar{b} = B^{-1} b$ the current right-hand side, assumed feasible so that $\\bar{b}_{i} \\ge 0$ for all rows $i$. The constraint rows can be written in dictionary form as\n$$\nx_{B_{i}} \\;=\\; \\bar{b}_{i} \\;-\\; \\sum_{j \\in N} \\bar{a}_{ij} \\, x_{j}, \\quad i = 1,2,3,\n$$\nwhere the tableau entries in column $j$ under the constraint rows are the $\\bar{a}_{ij}$. If we propose to increase a non-basic variable $x_{k}$ from $0$ by an amount $t \\ge 0$, then the basic variables update as\n$$\nx_{B_{i}}(t) \\;=\\; \\bar{b}_{i} \\;-\\; \\bar{a}_{ik} \\, t.\n$$\nFeasibility requires $x_{B_{i}}(t) \\ge 0$ for all $i$. Therefore, if $\\bar{a}_{ik} > 0$ for some $i$, then $t$ is bounded above by $\\bar{b}_{i} / \\bar{a}_{ik}$; this is the usual minimum-ratio test. Conversely, if $\\bar{a}_{ik} \\le 0$ for every constraint row $i$, then $x_{B_{i}}(t) \\ge \\bar{b}_{i} \\ge 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$, so feasibility imposes no upper bound on $t$.\n\nFor the objective row, the coefficient in row 0 is the reduced cost $r_{k}$. The algorithm uses that for maximization, an entering variable must have $r_{k}  0$; such a choice increases $z$ as $x_{k}$ increases. Therefore, the simplex method concludes the problem is unbounded if there exists a non-basic $x_{k}$ with\n$$\nr_{k}  0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{a}_{ik} \\le 0 \\text{ for all constraint rows } i,\n$$\nbecause then $x_{k}$ can be increased without bound while maintaining feasibility, and since $r_{k}  0$, the objective can be improved without bound.\n\nNow inspect each proposed column for $x_{k}$, where the first entry is $r_{k}$ and the next three entries are $\\bar{a}_{1k}, \\bar{a}_{2k}, \\bar{a}_{3k}$.\n\n- Option A: $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -4 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ has $r_{k} = 3 \\ge 0$, so $x_{k}$ would not improve the objective; no unboundedness conclusion.\n- Option B: $\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ has $r_{k}  0$, but there are positive constraint entries ($2$ and $1$). The ratio test yields a finite bound, so no unboundedness conclusion.\n- Option C: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ has $r_{k} = 0$, so no improvement; no unboundedness conclusion.\n- Option D: $\\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ has $r_{k}  0$ and all constraint entries are $\\le 0$.
