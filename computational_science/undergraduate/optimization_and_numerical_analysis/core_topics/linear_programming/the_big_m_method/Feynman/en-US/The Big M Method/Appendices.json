This exercise provides geometric intuition by tracking the path of the simplex algorithm through the solution space of a two-dimensional problem.

            "problem": "A manufacturing company produces two products, P1 and P2. The profit per unit of P1 is $3 and the profit per unit of P2 is $5. The production process is subject to several constraints. A quality control standard requires that the total number of units of P1 and three times the number of units of P2 be at least 3 units combined. A resource limitation dictates that the total number of units produced (P1 and P2 combined) cannot exceed 4 units. Let $x_1$ be the number of units of P1 and $x_2$ be the number of units of P2. The company aims to maximize its total profit, $Z$.

This path begins at the origin $(0,0)$, which corresponds to the initial state where the decision variables are non-basic. Determine the sequence of coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$ for all vertices visited by the algorithm, starting from the origin and ending at the vertex that provides the optimal solution.\n\nPresent your answer as a matrix where each row represents the coordinates $(x_1, x_2)$ of a visited vertex, in the order they are visited.",

Introduce a surplus variable $s_{1} \\geq 0$ and an artificial variable $a_{1} \\geq 0$ for the first constraint, and a slack variable $s_{2} \\geq 0$ for the second:\n$$x_{1} + 3x_{2} - s_{1} + a_{1} = 3,$$\n$$x_{1} + x_{2} + s_{2} = 4.$$\nPhase I minimizes $W = a_{1}$. The initial basic feasible solution in the augmented space is obtained by setting the decision variables nonbasic: $x_{1} = 0$, $x_{2} = 0$, $s_{1} = 0$, which gives $a_{1} = 3$ from the first equation and $s_{2} = 4$ from the second. This corresponds to the starting point $(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (0,0)$ in the $(x_{1}, x_{2})$-plane.\n\nExpress $W$ in terms of nonbasic variables using $a_{1} = 3 - x_{1} - 3x_{2} + s_{1}$, hence\n$$W = 3 - x_{1} - 3x_{2} + s_{1}.$$\nTo reduce $W$, choose the entering variable with the most negative coefficient: $x_{2}$ (coefficient $-3$) enters. Perform the ratio test on the basic variables to determine how far $x_{2}$ can increase while keeping $a_{1}, s_{2} \\geq 0$ with $x_{1} = 0$, $s_{1} = 0$:\n$$a_{1} = 3 - 3x_{2} \\geq 0 \\implies x_{2} \\leq 1,$$\n$$s_{2} = 4 - x_{2} \\geq 0 \\implies x_{2} \\leq 4.$$\nThe tight bound is $x_{2} = 1$, so $a_{1}$ leaves the basis and we reach $(x_{1}, x_{2}) = (0,1)$.\n\nAt this point $a_{1} = 0$ and Phase I is complete; we proceed to Phase II with the original objective $Z = 3x_{1} + 5x_{2}$. The current basis is $\\{x_{2}, s_{2}\\}$ with nonbasics $\\{x_{1}, s_{1}\\}$. Solve the constraints for the basic variables in terms of the nonbasics:\nFrom $x_{1} + 3x_{2} - s_{1} = 3$ and $x_{1} + x_{2} + s_{2} = 4$, with $\\{x_{2}, s_{2}\\}$ basic and $\\{x_{1}, s_{1}\\}$ nonbasic, we obtain\n$$x_{2} = \\frac{3 - x_{1} + s_{1}}{3}, \\quad s_{2} = 3 - \\frac{2}{3}x_{1} - \\frac{1}{3}s_{1}.$$\nExpress $Z$ in terms of the nonbasics:\n$$Z = 3x_{1} + 5x_{2} = 3x_{1} + 5\\left(\\frac{3 - x_{1} + s_{1}}{3}\\right) = 5 + \\frac{4}{3}x_{1} + \\frac{5}{3}s_{1}.$$\nUsing Dantzig’s rule for maximization, the entering variable is the nonbasic with the largest positive reduced cost; here $s_{1}$ (coefficient $\\frac{5}{3}$) enters. With $x_{1}$ fixed at $0$, increase $s_{1}$ from $0$ and apply the ratio test to keep the basic variables nonnegative:\n$$x_{2} = 1 + \\frac{s_{1}}{3} \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{(always true for } s_{1} \\geq 0\\text{)},$$\n$$s_{2} = 3 - \\frac{s_{1}}{3} \\geq 0 \\implies s_{1} \\leq 9.$$\nThus $s_{2}$ reaches $0$ first at $s_{1} = 9$, yielding $x_{2} = 1 + 9/3 = 4$ and $x_{1} = 0$. This is the vertex $(0,4)$, which is optimal since among feasible vertices it maximizes $Z$.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of visited vertices in the $(x_{1}, x_{2})$-plane, starting at the origin and ending at the optimal solution, is:\n- $(0,0)$,\n- $(0,1)$,\n- $(0,4)$.",
