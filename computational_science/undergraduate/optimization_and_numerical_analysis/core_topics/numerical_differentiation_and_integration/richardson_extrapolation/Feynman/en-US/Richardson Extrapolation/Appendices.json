            "introduction": "The first step in mastering Richardson extrapolation is to apply it in a typical scenario. Often in scientific computing, we use a method with a known error order, like $O(h)$. This practice  simulates a common engineering problem where two approximations are cleverly combined to produce a third, much more accurate estimate, effectively canceling the primary source of error.",

            "problem": "A team of aerospace engineers is simulating the atmospheric entry of a new space probe. They are particularly interested in estimating the maximum deceleration experienced by the probe, a critical parameter for structural design. The numerical algorithm they use to solve the equations of motion has a first-order global truncation error, meaning the error in the estimate is of order $O(h)$, where $h$ is the time step size used in the simulation.\n\nLet $D(h)$ be the estimated maximum deceleration when the simulation is run with a time step of $h$.\nThe team performs two simulations:\n1.  With a time step of $h_1 = 0.4$ seconds, they find the maximum deceleration to be $D(0.4) = 58.6$ $m/s^2$.\n2.  With a reduced time step of $h_2 = 0.2$ seconds, they find the maximum deceleration to be $D(0.2) = 59.3$ $m/s^2$.\n\nTo obtain a more accurate result without performing another lengthy simulation with an even smaller time step, the engineers decide to apply Richardson extrapolation to these two estimates. Calculate the improved estimate for the maximum deceleration. Express your answer in $m/s^2$, rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "Because the numerical method has first-order global truncation error, the estimated quantity satisfies the asymptotic error model\n$$\nD(h) = D^{\\ast} + C h + O(h^{2}),\n$$\nwhere $D^{\\ast}$ is the true maximum deceleration and $C$ is an $h$-independent constant.\n\nLet $h_{1} = 0.4$, $h_{2} = 0.2$, and define the refinement ratio $r = \\frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}} = 2$.

            "problem": "A physics student is numerically estimating the instantaneous velocity of a particle at a specific moment. The numerical method used to approximate the velocity has a leading error term proportional to the step size $h$, which can be written as Error $\\propto h$.\n\nUsing an initial step size $h$, the student obtains a velocity estimate of $10.1$ m/s. To improve the result, the student then combines this estimate with a second, more accurate estimate that was computed using a step size of $h/2$. This combination process, known as Richardson extrapolation, is designed to cancel the leading error term and yields a final, refined velocity value of $10.5$ m/s.\n\nCalculate the value of the second estimate, which was computed using the step size of $h/2$.

            "introduction": "The power of Richardson extrapolation is most evident when applied in multiple stages. For numerical methods whose error unfolds as a series in even powers of the step size (e.g., $A_{\\text{true}} + K_1 h^2 + K_2 h^4 + \\cdots$), we can peel away error terms one by one. This practice  guides you through a two-level extrapolation, using three data points to achieve a much higher order of accuracy than what is possible with a single step.",
