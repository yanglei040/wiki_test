This exercise invites you to visualize this principle by approximating the volume of a solid of revolution using the method of cylindrical disks, which is a direct application of a right Riemann sum to a three-dimensional problem . By summing the volumes of simple shapes, you will build an approximation of a more complex solid, reinforcing the core idea of integration as a process of accumulation.",

A solid is generated by revolving this region about the x-axis.\n\nWe wish to approximate the volume of this solid using a numerical method. To do this, approximate the volume by summing the volumes of four cylindrical disks of equal thickness. The radius of each disk must be determined by the value of the function at the right-hand endpoint of its corresponding subinterval.\n\nExpress your final answer as an analytic expression in terms of $\\pi$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to approximate the volume of a solid of revolution using a specific numerical technique, which is equivalent to a right Riemann sum for the volume integral.\n\nFirst, we identify the given information:\nThe function defining the radius of the solid at a given $x$ is $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$.\nThe solid is generated by revolving the region over the interval $[a, b] = [0, 4]$.\nWe are to use $n=4$ cylindrical disks of equal thickness to approximate the volume.\n\nThe width of each subinterval, which corresponds to the thickness of each cylindrical disk, is denoted by $\\Delta x$. We calculate it as follows:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{b-a}{n} = \\frac{4-0}{4} = 1 $$\n\nThe interval $[0, 4]$ is thus divided into $n=4$ subintervals, each of width $\\Delta x = 1$. These subintervals are:\n$[0, 1]$, $[1, 2]$, $[2, 3]$, and $[3, 4]$.\n\nThe problem states that the radius of each disk is determined by the function's value at the right-hand endpoint of its subinterval. Let's identify these right endpoints, which we can denote as $x_i$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\nFor the first subinterval $[0, 1]$, the right endpoint is $x_1 = 1$.\nFor the second subinterval $[1, 2]$, the right endpoint is $x_2 = 2$.\nFor the third subinterval $[2, 3]$, the right endpoint is $x_3 = 3$.\nFor the fourth subinterval $[3, 4]$, the right endpoint is $x_4 = 4$.\n\nThe volume of a single thin cylindrical disk is given by the formula $V_{\\text{disk}} = \\pi (\\text{radius})^2 (\\text{thickness})$.\nFor the $i$-th disk in our approximation, the radius is $R_i = f(x_i) = \\sqrt{x_i}$, and the thickness is $\\Delta x$.\nTherefore, the volume of the $i$-th disk is $V_i = \\pi [f(x_i)]^2 \\Delta x$.\nSubstituting the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$, we get:\n$$ V_i = \\pi (\\sqrt{x_i})^2 \\Delta x = \\pi x_i \\Delta x $$\n\nNow, we calculate the volume for each of the four disks using their respective right endpoints and $\\Delta x = 1$:\nThe volume of the first disk, $V_1$ (using $x_1=1$):\n$$ V_1 = \\pi (x_1) \\Delta x = \\pi (1) (1) = \\pi $$\nThe volume of the second disk, $V_2$ (using $x_2=2$):\n$$ V_2 = \\pi (x_2) \\Delta x = \\pi (2) (1) = 2\\pi $$\nThe volume of the third disk, $V_3$ (using $x_3=3$):\n$$ V_3 = \\pi (x_3) \\Delta x = \\pi (3) (1) = 3\\pi $$\nThe volume of the fourth disk, $V_4$ (using $x_4=4$):\n$$ V_4 = \\pi (x_4) \\Delta x = \\pi (4) (1) = 4\\pi $$\n\nThe total approximate volume, $V_{\\text{approx}}$, is the sum of the volumes of these four disks:\n$$ V_{\\text{approx}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + V_4 = \\pi + 2\\pi + 3\\pi + 4\\pi = 10\\pi $$\n\nThis calculation is a right Riemann sum for the volume integral $V = \\int_{0}^{4} \\pi [f(x)]^2 dx$:\n$$ V_{\\text{approx}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\pi [f(x_i)]^2 \\Delta x = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\pi x_i \\Delta x = \\pi \\Delta x \\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i $$\nWith $\\Delta x = 1$ and $x_i = i$, this becomes:\n$$ V_{\\text{approx}} = \\pi (1) (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = \\pi (10) = 10\\pi $$",
