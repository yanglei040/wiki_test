            "problem": "In applying Gaussian elimination to solve a linear system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, a pivoting strategy is often employed to enhance numerical stability. One such strategy is scaled partial pivoting. In this method, before the $k$-th elimination step, we select a pivot row from the set of rows $\\{k, k+1, \\dots, n\\}$. The chosen pivot row, designated by index $p$, is the one that maximizes the ratio of the absolute value of the potential pivot element to a pre-computed scale factor for that row. Specifically, we find $p$ such that\n$$\n\\frac{|A_{pk}^{(k-1)}|}{s_p} = \\max_{i=k, \\dots, n} \\frac{|A_{ik}^{(k-1)}|}{s_i}\n$$\nwhere $A_{ij}^{(k-1)}$ denotes the matrix elements after the first $k-1$ elimination steps, and the scale factor $s_i$ for each row $i$ is determined only once from the original matrix $A^{(0)} = A$ as $s_i = \\max_{j=1, \\dots, n} |A_{ij}|$.
