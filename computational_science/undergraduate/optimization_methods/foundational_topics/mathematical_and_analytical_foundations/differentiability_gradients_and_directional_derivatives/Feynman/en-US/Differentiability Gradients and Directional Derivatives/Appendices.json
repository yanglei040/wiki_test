A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe function is $f(x) = \\max\\{0, \\|x\\|-1\\}^2$. We analyze the function in three distinct regions of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n**Part (i): Gradient for $\\|x\\|1$**\n\nFor any $x$ in the open unit ball, i.e., $\\|x\\|1$, the term $\\|x\\|-1$ is negative. The definition of the maximum function implies $\\max\\{0, \\|x\\|-1\\} = 0$.\nThus, for all $x$ such that $\\|x\\|1$, the function simplifies to:\n$$f(x) = 0^2 = 0$$\nThe function $f(x)$ is constant on the open set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\|x\\|1\\}$. The derivative of a constant function is the zero map, and its corresponding gradient is the zero vector.\nTherefore, for $\\|x\\|1$, the gradient is:\n$$\\nabla f(x) = 0$$\n\n**Part (ii): Gradient for $\\|x\\|1$**\n\nFor any $x$ outside the closed unit ball, i.e., $\\|x\\|1$, the term $\\|x\\|-1$ is positive. The definition of the maximum function implies $\\max\\{0, \\|x\\|-1\\} = \\|x\\|-1$.\nThus, for all $x$ such that $\\|x\\|1$, the function simplifies to:\n$$f(x) = (\\|x\\|-1)^2$$\nThis function is a composition $f(x) = g(h(x))$, where $g(u) = u^2$ and $h(x) = \\|x\\|-1$. Both functions are differentiable in their respective domains (for $h(x)$, we require $x \\neq 0$, which is satisfied since $\\|x\\|1$). We apply the chain rule for gradients: $\\nabla f(x) = g'(h(x)) \\nabla h(x)$.\n\nThe derivative of $g(u)$ is $g'(u) = 2u$. Evaluated at $h(x)$, this gives $g'(h(x)) = 2(\\|x\\|-1)$.\nThe gradient of $h(x)$ is $\\nabla h(x) = \\nabla(\\|x\\|-1) = \\nabla(\\|x\\|)$. The gradient of the Euclidean norm is a standard result: $\\nabla(\\|x\\|) = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}$ for $x \\neq 0$.\n\nCombining these results, the gradient of $f(x)$ for $\\|x\\|1$ is:\n$$\\nabla f(x) = 2(\\|x\\|-1) \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}$$\nThis can also be written as $\\nabla f(x) = 2\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\|x\\|}\\right)x$.\n\n**Part (iii): Differentiability and Directional Derivative for $\\|x_0\\|=1$**\n\nLet $x_0$ be a point on the boundary of the unit ball, so $\\|x_0\\|=1$. At this point, $f(x_0) = \\max\\{0, \\|x_0\\|-1\\}^2 = \\max\\{0, 1-1\\}^2 = 0$.\n\nFirst, we investigate differentiability. A function is differentiable at a point if its partial derivatives exist and are continuous in a neighborhood of that point.\nFrom parts (i) and (ii), the gradient is piecewise defined:\n$$ \\nabla f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{if } \\|x\\|  1 \\\\ 2\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\|x\\|}\\right)x  \\text{if } \\|x\\|  1 \\end{cases} $$\nLet's check the limit of the gradient as $x \\to x_0$ where $\\|x_0\\|=1$.\nFrom the interior region ($\\|x\\|1$): $\\lim_{x\\to x_0, \\|x\\|1} \\nabla f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to x_0, \\|x\\|1} 0 = 0$.\nFrom the exterior region ($\\|x\\|1$): $\\lim_{x\\to x_0, \\|x\\|1} \\nabla f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to x_0, \\|x\\|1} 2\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\|x\\|}\\right)x = 2\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\|x_0\\|}\\right)x_0 = 2\\left(1-\\frac{1}{1}\\right)x_0 = 0$.\nSince the limits from both sides agree and are equal to the zero vector, we can define $\\nabla f(x_0) = 0$. The resulting gradient function $\\nabla f(x)$ is continuous for all $x \\neq 0$. The continuity of the partial derivatives implies that the function $f$ is continuously differentiable ($C^1$) for all $x \\neq 0$. This includes all points $x_0$ on the boundary $\\|x_0\\|=1$. Therefore, $f$ is differentiable at these points, and its gradient is $\\nabla f(x_0) = 0$.\n\nNow, we compute the directional derivative $D f(x_0; d)$ for an arbitrary direction $d \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $f$ is differentiable at $x_0$, the directional derivative is given by the dot product of the gradient and the direction vector:\n$$D f(x_0; d) = (\\nabla f(x_0))^{\\top}d$$\nSubstituting the gradient we found, $\\nabla f(x_0) = 0$:\n$$D f(x_0; d) = 0^{\\top}d = 0$$\nThis holds for any direction $d \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nAs a verification, we can compute this directly from the limit definition:\n$D f(x_0; d) = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{f(x_0+td) - f(x_0)}{t} = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{\\max\\{0, \\|x_0+td\\|-1\\}^2}{t}$.\nWe use the expansion $\\|x_0+td\\| = \\sqrt{\\|x_0\\|^2 + 2t(x_0^\\top d) + t^2\\|d\\|^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 2t(x_0^\\top d) + t^2\\|d\\|^2}$.\nUsing the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+u} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}u + O(u^2)$ for small $u$, we have:\n$\\|x_0+td\\| = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(2t(x_0^\\top d) + t^2\\|d\\|^2) + O(t^2) = 1 + t(x_0^\\top d) + O(t^2)$.\nSo, $\\|x_0+td\\|-1 = t(x_0^\\top d) + O(t^2)$.\nThe limit becomes:\n$D f(x_0; d) = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{\\max\\{0, t(x_0^\\top d) + O(t^2)\\}^2}{t}$.\nThe numerator is of order $O(t^2)$, as $\\max\\{0, \\dots\\}^2$ will be either $0$ or $(t(x_0^\\top d) + O(t^2))^2 = O(t^2)$.\nThe expression inside the limit is therefore $\\frac{O(t^2)}{t} = O(t)$.\nAs $t \\to 0$, $O(t) \\to 0$. This confirms that the directional derivative is $0$.\n\nThe final results are:\n(i) For $\\|x\\|1$, $\\nabla f(x) = 0$.\n(ii) For $\\|x\\|1$, $\\nabla f(x) = 2(\\|x\\|-1)\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}$.\n(iii) At $\\|x_0\\|=1$, for any direction $d$, $D f(x_0; d) = 0$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is found to be self-contained, mathematically sound, and well-posed.

The directional derivative $D_{v_{i}} f(x_{0})$ is defined as:\n$$\nD_{v_{i}} f(x_{0}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_{0} + t v_{i}) - f(x_{0})}{t}\n$$\nWe begin by expanding the term $f(x_{0} + t v_{i})$:\n$$\nf(x_{0} + t v_{i}) = \\|A(x_{0} + t v_{i}) - b\\|_{2}^{2} = \\|(A x_{0} - b) + t A v_{i}\\|_{2}^{2}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the residual, $r = A x_{0} - b$, we have:\n$$\nf(x_{0} + t v_{i}) = \\|r + t A v_{i}\\|_{2}^{2}\n$$\nExpanding the squared L2-norm, which is equivalent to the dot product of the vector with itself:\n$$\n\\|r + t A v_{i}\\|_{2}^{2} = (r + t A v_{i})^{\\top}(r + t A v_{i}) = r^{\\top}r + 2t r^{\\top}(A v_{i}) + t^{2} (A v_{i})^{\\top}(A v_{i})\n$$\nThis can be written in terms of norms as:\n$$\nf(x_{0} + t v_{i}) = \\|r\\|_{2}^{2} + 2t r^{\\top}(A v_{i}) + t^{2} \\|A v_{i}\\|_{2}^{2}\n$$\nGiven that $f(x_{0}) = \\|A x_{0} - b\\|_{2}^{2} = \\|r\\|_{2}^{2}$, we can form the difference quotient:\n$$\n\\frac{f(x_{0} + t v_{i}) - f(x_{0})}{t} = \\frac{(\\|r\\|_{2}^{2} + 2t r^{\\top}(A v_{i}) + t^{2} \\|A v_{i}\\|_{2}^{2}) - \\|r\\|_{2}^{2}}{t} = 2 r^{\\top}(A v_{i}) + t \\|A v_{i}\\|_{2}^{2}\n$$\nTaking the limit as $t \\to 0$:\n$$\nD_{v_{i}} f(x_{0}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} (2 r^{\\top}(A v_{i}) + t \\|A v_{i}\\|_{2}^{2}) = 2 r^{\\top}(A v_{i})\n$$\nTo express this in the desired terms, we use the SVD of $A$. From $A = U \\Sigma V^{\\top}$, we can write $A V = U \\Sigma$. Since the columns of $V$ are the right singular vectors $v_{j}$, the $i$-th column of the matrix equation gives $A v_{i} = \\sigma_{i} u_{i}$, where $u_{i}$ is the $i$-th left singular vector (the $i$-th column of $U$) and $\\sigma_{i}$ is the corresponding singular value.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the directional derivative:\n$$\nD_{v_{i}} f(x_{0}) = 2 r^{\\top}(\\sigma_{i} u_{i}) = 2 \\sigma_{i} (r^{\\top} u_{i})\n$$\nBy definition, the component $c_{i}$ of the vector $c = U^{\\top} r$ is $c_{i} = u_{i}^{\\top} r$. Since the dot product is symmetric ($u_{i}^{\\top} r = r^{\\top} u_{i}$), we arrive at the final expression for the first part:\n$$\nD_{v_{i}} f(x_{0}) = 2 \\sigma_{i} c_{i}\n$$\n\nSecond, we derive the cosine of the angle between the steepest descent direction at $x_{0}$, which is $d = - \\nabla f(x_{0})$, and a right singular vector $v_{k}$. The cosine of the angle $\\theta_{k}$ between two non-zero vectors $p$ and $q$ is given by $\\cos(\\theta_{k}) = \\frac{p^{\\top}q}{\\|p\\|_{2}\\|q\\|_{2}}$. Here, $p = d = -\\nabla f(x_{0})$ and $q = v_{k}$.\n\nFirst, we find the gradient of $f(x) = \\|Ax - b\\|_{2}^{2} = (Ax-b)^{\\top}(Ax-b)$.\n$$\nf(x) = (x^{\\top}A^{\\top} - b^{\\top})(Ax-b) = x^{\\top}A^{\\top}Ax - 2b^{\\top}Ax + b^{\\top}b\n$$\nThe gradient of this quadratic form with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x) = 2 A^{\\top} A x - 2 A^{\\top} b = 2 A^{\\top} (A x - b)\n$$\nAt the point $x_{0}$, using the residual $r=Ax_0-b$:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x_{0}) = 2 A^{\\top} r\n$$\nThe steepest descent direction is $d = - \\nabla f(x_{0}) = -2 A^{\\top} r$.\n\nNow we compute the terms for the cosine formula. The numerator is the dot product $d^{\\top}v_{k}$:\n$$\nd^{\\top}v_{k} = (-2 A^{\\top} r)^{\\top}v_{k} = -2 r^{\\top} A v_{k}\n$$\nUsing the relation $A v_{k} = \\sigma_{k} u_{k}$ and the definition $c_{k} = u_{k}^{\\top} r$:\n$$\nd^{\\top}v_{k} = -2 r^{\\top} (\\sigma_{k} u_{k}) = -2 \\sigma_{k} (r^{\\top} u_{k}) = -2 \\sigma_{k} c_{k}\n$$\nThe denominator involves the norms of the vectors. The vector $v_{k}$ is a column of the orthogonal matrix $V$, so it is a unit vector: $\\|v_{k}\\|_{2} = 1$. The norm of the steepest descent direction is:\n$$\n\\|d\\|_{2} = \\|-2 A^{\\top} r\\|_{2} = 2 \\|A^{\\top} r\\|_{2}\n$$\nWe must express $\\|A^{\\top} r\\|_{2}$ in terms of $\\{\\sigma_{j}\\}$ and $\\{c_{j}\\}$. We use the SVD for $A^{\\top} = (U \\Sigma V^{\\top})^{\\top} = V \\Sigma^{\\top} U^{\\top}$.\n$$\nA^{\\top}r = V \\Sigma^{\\top} (U^{\\top}r) = V \\Sigma^{\\top} c\n$$\nSince $V$ is an orthogonal matrix, it preserves the L2-norm, so $\\|A^{\\top}r\\|_{2} = \\|V \\Sigma^{\\top} c\\|_{2} = \\|\\Sigma^{\\top} c\\|_{2}$.\nThe matrix $\\Sigma^{\\top}$ is an $n \\times m$ diagonal matrix with entries $\\sigma_{1}, \\dots, \\sigma_{n}$ on its diagonal. The vector $c = U^{\\top}r \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ has components $c_{j}$. The product $\\Sigma^{\\top}c$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with components $(\\sigma_{j} c_{j})$ for $j = 1, \\dots, n$.\n$$\n\\Sigma^{\\top} c = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} c_{1} \\\\ \\sigma_{2} c_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\sigma_{n} c_{n} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe norm is therefore:\n$$\n\\|A^{\\top} r\\|_{2} = \\|\\Sigma^{\\top} c\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\sigma_{j} c_{j})^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting all parts into the cosine formula:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta_{k}) = \\frac{d^{\\top}v_{k}}{\\|d\\|_{2} \\|v_{k}\\|_{2}} = \\frac{-2 \\sigma_{k} c_{k}}{(2 \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sigma_{j}^{2} c_{j}^{2}})(1)} = \\frac{-\\sigma_{k} c_{k}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sigma_{j}^{2} c_{j}^{2}}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nThird, we explain how ill-conditioning affects the alignment of the initial gradient descent trajectory with the right singular vectors $v_{k}$. The alignment is measured by $|\\cos(\\theta_{k})|$. Let us consider the squared cosine for simplicity:\n$$\n\\cos^{2}(\\theta_{k}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{k}^{2} c_{k}^{2}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sigma_{j}^{2} c_{j}^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression shows how the squared-magnitude of the projection of the gradient direction onto $v_k$ is distributed. Ill-conditioning implies that the singular values vary over a large range, i.e., $\\sigma_{1} \\gg \\sigma_{n}$. Assuming the components $c_{j} = u_{j}^{\\top} r$ are non-zero and of comparable magnitude, the sum in the denominator, $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sigma_{j}^{2} c_{j}^{2}$, will be overwhelmingly dominated by the terms corresponding to the largest singular values.\nFor instance, the term $\\sigma_{1}^{2} c_{1}^{2}$ will be much larger than $\\sigma_{n}^{2} c_{n}^{2}$.\nConsequently, for a singular vector $v_{k}$ associated with a large singular value $\\sigma_{k}$ (e.g., $k=1$), the numerator $\\sigma_{k}^{2} c_{k}^{2}$ will be large, making $\\cos^{2}(\\theta_{k})$ close to $1$. The steepest descent direction $-\\nabla f(x_{0})$ is thus strongly aligned with $v_{k}$.\nConversely, for a singular vector $v_{k}$ associated with a small singular value $\\sigma_{k}$ (e.g., $k=n$), the numerator $\\sigma_{k}^{2} c_{k}^{2}$ will be very small compared to the denominator, making $\\cos^{2}(\\theta_{k})$ close to $0$. The steepest descent direction is nearly orthogonal to these singular vectors.\nTherefore, the initial trajectory of gradient descent, which follows $-\\nabla f(x_{0})$, aligns predominantly with the right singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values. This leads to rapid initial reduction of the error components in these directions but extremely slow progress for error components associated with small singular values, which is the characteristic slow convergence of gradient descent on ill-conditioned problems.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the function $f(x,y)=|x|+y^2$ with respect to its differentiability, directional derivatives, and the behavior of the Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm near the non-differentiable ridge at $x=0$. The analysis will be conducted in three distinct tasks.\n\n**Task 1: Directional Derivatives at the Origin**\n\nThe first task is to compute the one-sided directional derivative of $f$ at the origin $z=(0,0)$ for three specified directions and determine if they are descent directions. The definition of the directional derivative of a function $f$ at a point $z$ in a direction $d$ is given by:\n$$D f(z;d)=\\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{f(z+t d)-f(z)}{t}$$\nFor our function $f(x,y) = |x| + y^2$ and the point $z=(0,0)$, we have $f(z) = f(0,0) = |0| + 0^2 = 0$. Let the direction be $d=(d_x, d_y)$. The point $z+td$ is $(td_x, td_y)$. The value of the function at this point is:\n$$f(z+td) = f(td_x, td_y) = |td_x| + (td_y)^2$$\nSince the limit is for $t \\to 0^{+}$, $t$ is positive, so $|t|=t$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$f(td_x, td_y) = t|d_x| + t^2d_y^2$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the directional derivative:\n$$D f((0,0);d) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{(t|d_x| + t^2d_y^2) - 0}{t} = \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}\\left(\\frac{t|d_x|}{t} + \\frac{t^2d_y^2}{t}\\right) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}}(|d_x| + td_y^2)$$\nAs $t \\to 0^{+}$, the term $td_y^2$ goes to $0$. The limit is thus:\n$$D f((0,0);(d_x, d_y)) = |d_x|$$\nA direction $d$ is a descent direction if $D f(z;d)  0$. We now apply this to each direction in the set $\\mathcal{D}=\\{(1,0),(-0.3,0.7),(0,1)\\}$.\n\n1.  For $d_1=(1,0)$: $D f((0,0);d_1) = |1| = 1$. Since $1 \\not 0$, this is not a descent direction.\n2.  For $d_2=(-0.3,0.7)$: $D f((0,0);d_2) = |-0.3| = 0.3$. Since $0.3 \\not 0$, this is not a descent direction.\n3.  For $d_3=(0,1)$: $D f((0,0);d_3) = |0| = 0$. Since $0 \\not 0$, this is not a descent direction.\n\nThe boolean results for Task 1 are (False, False, False).\n\n**Task 2: Assessment of the Negative Gradient as a Descent Direction**\n\nThe second task is to assess whether the negative gradient, $-\\nabla f(z)$, constitutes a descent direction at points where $f$ is differentiable. The points are taken from the set $\\mathcal{Z}=\\{(0.1,0),(-0.02,0.05)\\}$, where $x \\neq 0$.\n\nFor $x \\neq 0$, the function $f(x,y)=|x|+y^2$ is differentiable. Its partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} |x| = \\operatorname{sign}(x)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} y^2 = 2y$$\nThe gradient vector is $\\nabla f(x,y) = (\\operatorname{sign}(x), 2y)^\\top$.\n\nAt a point $z$ where $f$ is differentiable, the directional derivative in a direction $d$ is given by the dot product $D f(z;d) = \\nabla f(z)^\\top d$. We are interested in the specific direction $d = -\\nabla f(z)$.\n$$D f(z;-\\nabla f(z)) = \\nabla f(z)^\\top (-\\nabla f(z)) = -(\\nabla f(z)^\\top \\nabla f(z)) = -\\|\\nabla f(z)\\|_2^2$$\nThis direction is a descent direction if $D f(z;-\\nabla f(z))  0$, which is equivalent to $-\\|\\nabla f(z)\\|_2^2  0$. This inequality holds if and only if the gradient vector $\\nabla f(z)$ is not the zero vector.\n\nWe now evaluate this for the two points in $\\mathcal{Z}$.\n\n1.  For $z_1=(0.1,0)$:\n    $\\nabla f(0.1,0) = (\\operatorname{sign}(0.1), 2 \\cdot 0)^\\top = (1, 0)^\\top$.\n    This gradient is non-zero. The directional derivative is $D f(z_1;-\\nabla f(z_1)) = -\\|(1,0)\\|_2^2 = -1  0$. Thus, $-\\nabla f(z_1)$ is a descent direction.\n2.  For $z_2=(-0.02,0.05)$:\n    $\\nabla f(-0.02,0.05) = (\\operatorname{sign}(-0.02), 2 \\cdot 0.05)^\\top = (-1, 0.1)^\\top$.\n    This gradient is non-zero. The directional derivative is $D f(z_2;-\\nabla f(z_2)) = -\\|(-1, 0.1)\\|_2^2 = -( (-1)^2 + 0.1^2 ) = -1.01  0$. Thus, $-\\nabla f(z_2)$ is a descent direction.\n\nThe boolean results for Task 2 are (True, True).\n\n**Task 3: Gradient Descent Simulation**\n\nThe third task involves simulating Gradient Descent and counting sign flips in the $x$-coordinate. The update rule is $(x_{k+1},y_{k+1})=(x_k,y_k)-\\alpha_k\\,(g_x(x_k),2y_k)$. The generalized gradient component $g_x(x)$ is defined as $\\operatorname{sign}(x)$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $g_x(0) = 0$. This is equivalent to $g_x(x) = \\operatorname{sign}(x)$ using the standard definition where $\\operatorname{sign}(0)=0$.\n\nThe update for the $x$-coordinate is:\n$$x_{k+1} = x_k - \\alpha_k \\operatorname{sign}(x_k)$$\nA sign flip is counted if $x_k \\cdot x_{k+1}  0$. This occurs if $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$ are non-zero and have opposite signs. We start from $(x_0,y_0)=(0.5,0.4)$ and run for $N=50$ iterations.\n\ni) Constant step size $\\alpha=0.3$:\n$x_{k+1} = x_k - 0.3 \\operatorname{sign}(x_k)$.\n$x_0=0.5$. $x_1=0.5-0.3=0.2$. No flip.\n$x_2=0.2-0.3=-0.1$. Flip ($x_1 \\cdot x_2  0$).\n$x_3=-0.1+0.3=0.2$. Flip ($x_2 \\cdot x_3  0$).\nThe sequence for $x$ starting from $k=1$ oscillates between $0.2$ and $-0.1$. A flip occurs at every step from $k=1$ to $k=49$. The number of flips is $49 - 1 + 1 = 49$.\n\nii) Constant step size $\\alpha=0.05$:\n$x_{k+1} = x_k - 0.05 \\operatorname{sign}(x_k)$.\n$x_k$ decreases by $0.05$ at each step as long as $x_k0$.\n$x_0=0.5, x_1=0.45, \\dots, x_9=0.05$.\n$x_{10} = 0.05 - 0.05 = 0$.\nFor $k \\ge 10$, $x_k=0$, so $\\operatorname{sign}(x_k)=0$ and $x_{k+1}=x_k=0$.\nSince no iterate $x_{k+1}$ becomes negative, there are no instances of $x_k \\cdot x_{k+1}  0$. The flip count is $0$.\n\niii) Diminishing step size $\\alpha_k=\\frac{0.3}{k+1}$:\n$x_{k+1} = x_k - \\frac{0.3}{k+1}\\operatorname{sign}(x_k)$.\n$x_0=0.5$.\n$k=0$: $\\alpha_0=0.3$. $x_1=0.5-0.3=0.2$. No flip.\n$k=1$: $\\alpha_1=0.15$. $x_2=0.2-0.15=0.05$. No flip.\n$k=2$: $\\alpha_2=0.1$. $x_3=0.05-0.1=-0.05$. Flip ($x_2 \\cdot x_3  0$).\nA flip occurs at step $k$ if $|x_k|\\alpha_k$. For $k=2$, this condition is met. For subsequent steps, we find that the condition continues to be met, causing a sign flip at each step from $k=2$ to $k=49$.\nThe number of flips is $49 - 2 + 1 = 48$.\n\niv) Constant step size $\\alpha=0.5$:\n$x_{k+1} = x_k - 0.5 \\operatorname{sign}(x_k)$.\n$x_0=0.5$.\n$x_1=0.5-0.5=0$.\nFor $k \\ge 1$, $x_k=0$ and the sequence remains at $0$.\nThere are no instances of $x_k \\cdot x_{k+1}  0$. The flip count is $0$.\n\nThe integer results for Task 3 are (49, 0, 48, 0).",
