This practice helps develop a strong visual intuition for the concept of a convex hull, treating it as the shape formed by stretching a rubber band around a set of points. By identifying the vertices of the convex hull for a given collection of points, you will engage with the fundamental definition of a convex set and its boundary in a concrete and visualizable way .",

            "solution": "First, we identify the points in the set $S$. The equation $z^4 = -1$ gives the four 4th roots of -1. In polar form, $-1 = e^{i(\\pi + 2k\\pi)}$.

A point is a vertex if it cannot be expressed as a convex combination of the other points in the set.\n\nBy plotting the points, we can see that they form a convex pentagon. None of the five points lie inside the convex hull of the other four. For example, the point $P_5=(2,0)$ has the largest x-coordinate, so it cannot be a convex combination of the others and must be a vertex. Similarly, $P_2$ and $P_3$ share the smallest x-coordinate, so they must also be vertices. A similar check for $P_1$ and $P_4$ with respect to appropriately chosen lines (or by visual inspection) confirms they are also not contained within the hull of the remaining points. Therefore, all five points are vertices of their convex hull.\n\nThe complete set of vertices is $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5\\}$, which corresponds to the complex numbers listed in option D.",

            "solution": "The problem consists of three main parts: finding the convex hull of the set $S$, describing it with inequalities, and then optimizing a linear functional over it.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Convex Hull $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$**\n\nThe set $S$ is the arc of the parabola defined by the equation $y=x^{2}$ for $x$ in the closed interval $[-1, 1]$. The endpoints of this arc are $A=(-1, 1)$ and $B=(1, 1)$. The convex hull, $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$, is the smallest convex set containing $S$. This is the region bounded below by the parabolic arc $y=x^2$ and above by the line segment connecting the endpoints $A$ and $B$, which is the line $y=1$ for $x \\in [-1,1]$.\n\n**Part 2: Inequality Description for $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$**\n\nThe convex hull $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$ can be described as the set of points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the inequalities:\n$$y \\ge x^{2}$$\n$$y \\le 1$$\nThe condition $x \\in [-1, 1]$ is implied by these two inequalities, since $y \\ge x^2$ and $y \\le 1$ together require $x^2 \\le 1$.\n\n**Part 3: Maximization of $L(x,y) = x - 2y$**\n\nWe seek to solve the optimization problem:\n$$\\max_{(x,y) \\in \\operatorname{conv}(S)} L(x,y) = \\max_{(x,y) \\in \\operatorname{conv}(S)} (x - 2y)$$\nA fundamental result in convex optimization states that the maximum of a linear functional over a compact convex set is always attained at one of its extreme points. The set of extreme points of $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$ is the original set $S$ itself, i.e., the parabolic arc where the boundary is strictly convex.\n$$\\operatorname{ext}(\\operatorname{conv}(S)) = S = \\{(x, x^{2}) : x \\in [-1, 1]\\}$$\nThus, the optimization problem is equivalent to maximizing the functional over the set $S$. Substituting $y = x^{2}$, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional optimization problem:\n$$\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]} f(x) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad f(x) = x - 2x^{2}$$\nTo find the maximum of $f(x)$ on the closed interval $[-1, 1]$, we compute its derivative and find the critical points.\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x - 2x^{2}) = 1 - 4x$$\nSetting the derivative to zero: $1 - 4x = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThis critical point $x=\\frac{1}{4}$ lies within the interval $[-1, 1]$. The global maximum on the closed interval $[-1, 1]$ must occur either at this critical point or at the endpoints of the interval. We evaluate $f(x)$ at these three points:\n1.  At the critical point $x = \\frac{1}{4}$:\n    $$f\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4} - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n2.  At the left endpoint $x = -1$:\n    $$f(-1) = -1 - 2(-1)^{2} = -1 - 2 = -3$$\n3.  At the right endpoint $x = 1$:\n    $$f(1) = 1 - 2(1)^{2} = 1 - 2 = -1$$\nComparing the three values, $\\frac{1}{8}$, $-3$, and $-1$, the maximum value is $\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the linear functional $L(x,y)=x-2y$ over the convex hull $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$ is $\\frac{1}{8}$.",

            "solution": "We proceed with the solution in three parts: first, deriving the convex hull; second, solving the two optimization problems; and third, computing the optimality gap.\n\nFirst, we derive the convex hull of the set $S = \\{(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : z=xy, x \\in [\\ell_x, u_x], y \\in [\\ell_y, u_y]\\}$. This is known as the McCormick convex envelope. The convex hull is the tightest convex set containing $S$ and is described by the original box constraints on $x$ and $y$ along with four linear inequalities derived from the non-negativity of products of bound differences.\n1. From $(x-\\ell_x)(y-\\ell_y) \\ge 0$, we get $xy - \\ell_x y - \\ell_y x + \\ell_x \\ell_y \\ge 0$. Since $z=xy$, this implies the convex underestimator: $z \\ge \\ell_y x + \\ell_x y - \\ell_x \\ell_y$.\n2. From $(u_x-x)(u_y-y) \\ge 0$, we get $u_x u_y - u_x y - u_y x + xy \\ge 0$. This implies the second convex underestimator: $z \\ge u_y x + u_x y - u_x u_y$.\n3. From $(x-\\ell_x)(u_y-y) \\ge 0$, we get $u_y x - xy - \\ell_x u_y + \\ell_x y \\ge 0$. This implies the concave overestimator: $z \\le u_y x + \\ell_x y - \\ell_x u_y$.\n4. From $(u_x-x)(y-\\ell_y) \\ge 0$, we get $u_x y - u_x \\ell_y - xy + \\ell_y x \\ge 0$. This implies the second concave overestimator: $z \\le \\ell_y x + u_x y - u_x \\ell_y$.\n\nThese four inequalities, along with $x \\in [\\ell_x, u_x]$ and $y \\in [\\ell_y, u_y]$, define the convex hull of $S$.\n\nNext, we solve the original nonconvex optimization problem:\n$$\n\\max\\; z \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad z=xy,\\; x+y=4,\\; x\\in[0,4],\\; y\\in[0,4].\n$$\nWe substitute the linear constraint $y=4-x$ into the equation for $z$:\n$z = x(4-x) = 4x - x^2$.\nThe problem becomes maximizing the function $f(x) = 4x - x^2$ over the interval $x \\in [0,4]$. The constraint on $y$, $y \\in [0,4]$, becomes $4-x \\in [0,4]$, which implies $x \\in [0,4]$, so no new restriction is added. To find the maximum of the concave quadratic function $f(x)$, we take the derivative and set it to zero:\n$$\nf'(x) = 4 - 2x = 0 \\implies x = 2\n$$\nSince $x=2$ lies in the interval $[0,4]$, it is the maximizer. At $x=2$, the value of $z$ is $z = 4(2) - 2^2 = 8-4=4$. The optimal objective value of the nonconvex problem is $z^{\\star} = 4$.\n\nNow, we form the convex relaxation. We replace the nonconvex constraint $z=xy$ with its convex envelope for the bounds $\\ell_x=0$, $u_x=4$, $\\ell_y=0$, $u_y=4$. The problem becomes:\n$$\n\\max\\; z\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nz & \\ge 0 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y - 0 \\implies z \\ge 0 \\\\\nz & \\ge 4x + 4y - 16 \\implies z \\ge 4(x+y) - 16 \\\\\nz & \\le 4x + 0 \\cdot y - 0 \\implies z \\le 4x \\\\\nz & \\le 0 \\cdot x + 4y - 0 \\implies z \\le 4y \\\\\nx &+ y = 4 \\\\\nx & \\in [0,4], \\quad y \\in [0,4]\n\\end{align*}\nUsing $x+y=4$, the second inequality becomes $z \\ge 4(4) - 16 \\implies z \\ge 0$. Substituting $y=4-x$ into the overestimators, we get $z \\le 4x$ and $z \\le 4(4-x) = 16 - 4x$. The relaxed problem is a linear program:\n$$\n\\max\\; z \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad z \\le 4x, \\quad z \\le 16 - 4x, \\quad x \\in [0,4].\n$$\nTo maximize $z$, we must have $z \\le \\min(4x, 16-4x)$. We maximize this upper bound:\n$$\n\\max_{x \\in [0,4]} \\min(4x, 16-4x)\n$$\nThe maximum of $\\min(f_1(x), f_2(x))$ occurs where $f_1(x) = f_2(x)$:\n$4x = 16 - 4x \\implies 8x = 16 \\implies x = 2$.\nAt $x=2$, the maximum value of $z$ is $4(2) = 8$. The optimal value of the convex relaxation is $z_{\\mathrm{MC}} = 8$.\n\nFinally, we compute the multiplicative optimality gap $G$:\n$$\nG = \\frac{z_{\\mathrm{MC}}}{z^{\\star}} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2\n$$",
