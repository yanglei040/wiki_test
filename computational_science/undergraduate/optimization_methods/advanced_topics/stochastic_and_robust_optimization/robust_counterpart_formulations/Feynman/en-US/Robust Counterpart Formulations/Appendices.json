            "problem": "Consider a single-activity precedence relation in a project schedule, from activity $i$ to activity $j$, modeled by the deterministic constraint $S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + d_{ij}$, where $S_{i}$ and $S_{j}$ denote the planned start times of activities $i$ and $j$, respectively, and $d_{ij}$ is the activity duration along the precedence arc $(i,j)$. In the presence of uncertainty, suppose the true duration is a function $d_{ij}(u)$ of an uncertainty realization $u$, and that the planner only knows $d_{ij}(u)$ lies within the interval $[\\underline{d}_{ij}, \\overline{d}_{ij}]$. The planner uses a nominal duration $d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}}$ in the baseline schedule and seeks a robust counterpart formulation that ensures feasibility for all realizations of $u$ consistent with the interval.\n\nStarting from the foundational definition of robust counterpart formulations in Robust Optimization (RO)—that is, replacing a constraint involving uncertain parameters by its requirement to hold for all realizations in a specified uncertainty set—derive the robust precedence constraint for $S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + d_{ij}(u)$ under interval uncertainty. Show how this results in adding a worst-case slack to the nominal precedence constraint $S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}}$.\n\nAssume the following data for this precedence arc:\n- Nominal duration $d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}} = 6$ days.\n- Interval bounds $\\underline{d}_{ij} = 5$ days and $\\overline{d}_{ij} = 8$ days.\n\nCompute the numerical value of the worst-case slack that must be added to the nominal constraint to obtain the robust counterpart that is guaranteed feasible for all $u$ in the interval.

It presents a linear constraint with interval uncertainty, a classic case in RO. The terminology used, such as \"robust counterpart\" and \"uncertainty set,\" is precise and conforms to the standards of the field. The provided data is complete and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The question is clear and formalizable. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core principle of robust optimization is to ensure that a constraint holds for all possible realizations of the uncertain parameters within a specified uncertainty set. The original uncertain constraint is:\n$$S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + d_{ij}(u)$$\nThe uncertainty for the duration $d_{ij}(u)$ is defined by the interval set $\\mathcal{U}$, such that $d_{ij}(u) \\in [\\underline{d}_{ij}, \\overline{d}_{ij}]$.\n\nTo form the robust counterpart, we must enforce the constraint for every possible value of $d_{ij}(u)$ in this interval. This can be expressed as:\n$$S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + d_{ij}(u), \\quad \\forall d_{ij}(u) \\in [\\underline{d}_{ij}, \\overline{d}_{ij}]$$\nThe decision variables are the start times $S_{i}$ and $S_{j}$, which must be chosen before the actual duration $d_{ij}(u)$ is revealed. To satisfy the inequality for all possible $d_{ij}(u)$, the left-hand side, $S_{j} - S_{i}$, must be greater than or equal to the largest possible value that the right-hand side, $d_{ij}(u)$, can take. This represents the worst-case scenario for this precedence constraint.\n\nMathematically, we must satisfy:\n$$S_{j} - S_{i} \\ge \\max_{d_{ij}(u) \\in [\\underline{d}_{ij}, \\overline{d}_{ij}]} \\{d_{ij}(u)\\}$$\nFor the given interval uncertainty, the maximum value that the duration $d_{ij}(u)$ can attain is its upper bound, $\\overline{d}_{ij}$.\n$$\\max_{d_{ij}(u) \\in [\\underline{d}_{ij}, \\overline{d}_{ij}]} \\{d_{ij}(u)\\} = \\overline{d}_{ij}$$\nSubstituting this worst-case value back into the constraint gives the robust counterpart:\n$$S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + \\overline{d}_{ij}$$\nThis new constraint is deterministic and guarantees that the precedence relation will be satisfied no matter which value the duration $d_{ij}(u)$ takes within its specified interval.\n\nThe problem asks to express this robust constraint as the nominal constraint plus a worst-case slack. The nominal constraint is given as:\n$$S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}}$$\nTo find the slack, we can rewrite the robust counterpart by adding and subtracting the nominal duration $d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}} + (\\overline{d}_{ij} - d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}})$$\nBy comparing this to the form $S_{j} \\ge S_{i} + d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}} + \\text{slack}$, we can identify the worst-case slack as:\n$$\\text{slack} = \\overline{d}_{ij} - d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}}$$\nThis slack represents the additional time buffer that must be added to the nominal duration to protect the schedule against the worst-case delay.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this slack using the provided data:\n-   Nominal duration: $d_{ij}^{\\text{nom}} = 6$ days.\n-   Upper bound of interval: $\\overline{d}_{ij} = 8$ days.\n\nThe worst-case slack is calculated as:\n$$\\text{slack} = 8 - 6 = 2$$\nThus, a slack of $2$ days must be added to the nominal precedence constraint to ensure robustness against all possible duration realizations in the interval $[5, 8]$. The robust constraint is numerically $S_j \\ge S_i + 8$, which is equivalent to $S_j \\ge S_i + 6 + 2$.",

            "solution": "The problem is mathematically well-defined and internally consistent, allowing for a direct derivation of the requested quantity. The task is to find the supremum of the linear function $a(\\xi)^{\\top} x$ over the uncertainty set for the perturbation vector $\\xi$. The uncertainty set is defined as the closed $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm ball of radius $\\delta$.\n\nThe objective is to compute the value of the expression:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\|\\xi\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\delta} a(\\xi)^{\\top} x\n$$\n\nFirst, we substitute the given definition of the uncertain coefficient vector $a(\\xi) = \\bar{a} \\circ (1 + \\xi)$ into the expression. The symbol $\\circ$ represents the Hadamard (componentwise) product. The $i$-th component of $a(\\xi)$ is thus given by $a_i(\\xi) = \\bar{a}_i(1 + \\xi_i)$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nThe scalar product $a(\\xi)^{\\top} x$ can be written as a sum over the components:\n$$\na(\\xi)^{\\top} x = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i(\\xi) x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i (1 + \\xi_i) x_i\n$$\n\nWe can expand this sum and separate the terms that depend on $\\xi$ from those that do not:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i (1 + \\xi_i) x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\bar{a}_i x_i + \\bar{a}_i \\xi_i x_i) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i x_i\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i\\right)\n$$\nThe first term, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i x_i$, is simply the nominal value $\\bar{a}^{\\top} x$, which is constant with respect to $\\xi$.\n\nThe maximization problem can now be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\|\\xi\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\delta} \\left( \\bar{a}^{\\top} x + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\bar{a}^{\\top} x$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the supremum operator:\n$$\n\\bar{a}^{\\top} x + \\sup_{\\|\\xi\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\delta} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i \\right)\n$$\nThe remaining task is to solve the maximization problem $\\sup_{\\|\\xi\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\delta} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i$. The uncertainty set defined by $\\|\\xi\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\delta$ is equivalent to the set of componentwise constraints $|\\xi_i| \\le \\delta$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. This is equivalent to $-\\delta \\le \\xi_i \\le \\delta$ for all $i$.\n\nThe objective function of this subproblem, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i$, is a sum of terms where each term involves only one component $\\xi_i$. The constraints on the variables $\\xi_i$ are also decoupled. Therefore, we can maximize the sum by maximizing each term independently:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\|\\xi\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\delta} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sup_{|\\xi_i| \\le \\delta} (\\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i)\n$$\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, we need to maximize the linear function $f(\\xi_i) = (\\bar{a}_i x_i) \\xi_i$ over the interval $[-\\delta, \\delta]$. The maximum of a linear function over a closed interval is attained at one of its endpoints.\nLet $c_i = \\bar{a}_i x_i$. We want to maximize $c_i \\xi_i$ subject to $-\\delta \\le \\xi_i \\le \\delta$.\n- If $c_i > 0$, the maximum is achieved by choosing $\\xi_i$ to be its maximum possible value, which is $\\delta$. The maximized value is $c_i \\delta$.\n- If $c_i < 0$, the maximum is achieved by choosing $\\xi_i$ to be its minimum possible value, which is $-\\delta$. The maximized value is $c_i (-\\delta) = -c_i \\delta$.\n- If $c_i = 0$, the value is $0$ for any choice of $\\xi_i$.\n\nThese three cases can be unified using the absolute value function. The maximum value of $c_i \\xi_i$ is $|c_i| \\delta$.\nTherefore, $\\sup_{|\\xi_i| \\le \\delta} (\\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i) = |\\bar{a}_i x_i| \\delta$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\bar{a}_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$. This is a crucial piece of information. Since $\\bar{a}_i$ is non-negative, we can simplify the absolute value:\n$$\n|\\bar{a}_i x_i| = |\\bar{a}_i| |x_i| = \\bar{a}_i |x_i|\n$$\nSo, the maximum value for each term is $\\delta \\bar{a}_i |x_i|$.\n\nSumming these maximized terms over all $i$ gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sup_{|\\xi_i| \\le \\delta} (\\bar{a}_i x_i \\xi_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\delta \\bar{a}_i |x_i| = \\delta \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i |x_i|\n$$\nThis expression is the dual norm of the vector $(\\bar{a}_1 x_1, \\dots, \\bar{a}_n x_n)$ with respect to the $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm, scaled by $\\delta$. The dual norm of the $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm is the $\\ell_1$-norm.\n\nCombining this result with the constant nominal term, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the worst-case value of $a(\\xi)^{\\top} x$:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\|\\xi\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\delta} a(\\xi)^{\\top} x = \\bar{a}^{\\top} x + \\delta \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{a}_i |x_i|\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression in terms of $x$, $\\bar{a}$, and $\\delta$.",
