The method iteratively updates a simplex, a geometric figure consisting of $n+1$ vertices in an $n$-dimensional space, to explore the function's landscape.\n\nConsider the application of this method to find the minimum of a one-dimensional function $f(x)$, where $n=1$. In this case, the simplex is simply a set of $n+1=2$ distinct points.

Then, a new test point is generated by reflecting the worst point through the centroid of all other points in the simplex. For our one-dimensional, two-point case, the \"centroid of all other points\" is simply the best point, $x_b$.\n\nThe new reflected point, $x_r$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$x_r = x_o + \\alpha(x_o - x_w)$$\nwhere $x_o$ is the centroid of the points excluding the worst one, $x_w$ is the worst point, and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant called the reflection coefficient.\n\nGiven the initial simplex and using a reflection coefficient of $\\alpha = 1$, calculate the value of the reflected point $x_r$ that would be generated in the first step of the algorithm.

Since $\\frac{2809}{256} \\approx 10.97$, the minimum (best) value among these is $10$.\nThe accepted moves in the two iterations were: Inside Contraction, and Inside Contraction.\nThe value of $f$ at the best vertex in the final simplex is $10$.",
