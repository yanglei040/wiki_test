For player $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ with a cost function $f_i(x_1, x_2)$ that is differentiable and convex in their own decision variable $x_i$, this condition is mathematically expressed by the first-order optimality condition, $\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_i} = 0$.\n\nThe cost function for player $i$ is given as:\n$$\nf_i(x_1,x_2) = \\frac{1}{2} q_i x_i^{2} + b_i x_i x_{-i} + c_i x_i\n$$\nwhere $x_{-i}$ is the decision of the other player. The problem states that $q_i > 0$, ensuring that $f_i$ is strictly convex with respect to $x_i$, which guarantees that the first-order condition identifies a unique minimum for player $i$'s optimization problem.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives for each player.\nFor player $1$:\n$$\nf_1(x_1,x_2) = \\frac{1}{2} q_1 x_1^{2} + b_1 x_1 x_2 + c_1 x_1\n$$\nThe first-order condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} = q_1 x_1 + b_1 x_2 + c_1 = 0\n$$\n\nFor player $2$:\n$$\nf_2(x_1,x_2) = \\frac{1}{2} q_2 x_2^{2} + b_2 x_2 x_1 + c_2 x_2\n$$\nThe first-order condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_2} = q_2 x_2 + b_2 x_1 + c_2 = 0\n$$\n\nThese two equations form a linear system for the Nash equilibrium $(x_1^{\\ast}, x_2^{\\ast})$:\n\\begin{align*}\nq_1 x_1^{\\ast} + b_1 x_2^{\\ast} &= -c_1 \\\\\nb_2 x_1^{\\ast} + q_2 x_2^{\\ast} &= -c_2\n\\end{align*}\nIn matrix form, this is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} q_1 & b_1 \\\\ b_2 & q_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1^{\\ast} \\\\ x_2^{\\ast} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -c_1 \\\\ -c_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe are given the parameter values: $q_1 = 2$, $q_2 = 4$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 1$, $c_1 = -5$, and $c_2 = 1$.

With the given values, $H_F = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$. The principal minors are $2 > 0$ and $\\det(H_F) = 2(4) - 2(2) = 4 > 0$. Since the Hessian is positive definite, $F$ is strictly convex, and the solution to the first-order conditions is the unique global minimum.\n\nSubstituting the parameter values into the system for the centralized solution:\n\\begin{align*}\n2 x_1^{c} + (1+1) x_2^{c} &= -(-5) \\implies 2 x_1^{c} + 2 x_2^{c} = 5 \\\\\n(1+1) x_1^{c} + 4 x_2^{c} &= -1 \\implies 2 x_1^{c} + 4 x_2^{c} = -1\n\\end{align*}\nWe now solve this system. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$$\n(2 x_1^{c} + 4 x_2^{c}) - (2 x_1^{c} + 2 x_2^{c}) = -1 - 5\n$$\n$$\n2 x_2^{c} = -6\n$$\n$$\nx_2^{c} = -3\n$$\nSubstituting $x_2^{c} = -3$ into the first equation:\n$$\n2 x_1^{c} + 2(-3) = 5\n$$\n$$\n2 x_1^{c} - 6 = 5\n$$\n$$\n2 x_1^{c} = 11\n$$\n$$\nx_1^{c} = \\frac{11}{2}\n$$\nThus, the centralized optimal solution is $(x_1^{c}, x_2^{c}) = (\\frac{11}{2}, -3)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final result as the concatenated row vector $\\big(x_1^{\\ast}, x_2^{\\ast}, x_1^{c}, x_2^{c}\\big)$.\nThe calculated values are $x_1^{\\ast} = 3$, $x_2^{\\ast} = -1$, $x_1^{c} = \\frac{11}{2}$, and $x_2^{c} = -3$.\nThe final vector is $\\big(3, -1, \\frac{11}{2}, -3\\big)$.",

Therefore, a unique Nash equilibrium $x^\\star$ exists and is found by solving this system of linear equations:\n$$\nx^\\star = -Q^{-1} c\n$$\nIn the implementation, this linear system is solved numerically for $x^\\star$ for stability and efficiency, rather than explicitly computing the inverse $Q^{-1}$.\n\n**2. Block Coordinate Descent (BCD)**\n\nBlock Coordinate Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that, in each step, minimizes the objective function with respect to a single coordinate, while keeping all other coordinates fixed. For this problem, we perform cyclic updates on each coordinate $x_i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. A single iteration of BCD, denoted by a counter $t$, consists of one such full cycle of $n$ updates.\n\nFor a quadratic potential $\\Phi(x)$, the minimization with respect to a single coordinate $x_i$ can be performed exactly. To find the optimal value for $x_i$ while holding $x_j$ fixed for all $j \\neq i$, we solve the stationarity condition for the $i$-th coordinate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Phi(x)}{\\partial x_i} = 0\n$$\nThe $i$-th component of the gradient $\\nabla \\Phi(x) = Qx+c$ is:\n$$\n(\\nabla \\Phi(x))_i = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} Q_{ij} x_j + c_i = Q_{ii} x_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} Q_{ij} x_j + c_i\n$$\nSetting this to zero and solving for $x_i$ gives the update rule for the new value of coordinate $i$:\n$$\nx_i^{\\text{new}} = - \\frac{1}{Q_{ii}} \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq i} Q_{ij} x_j + c_i \\right)\n$$\nSince $Q$ is positive definite, its diagonal entries $Q_{ii}$ are all positive, ensuring the division is well-defined. Our implementation updates the coordinates of the vector $x$ sequentially within a cycle. This method is equivalent to the Gauss-Seidel method for solving the linear system $Qx = -c$. The algorithm starts from an initial point $x^{(0)}$ and terminates when the Euclidean distance to the true equilibrium, $\\lVert x^{(t)} - x^\\star \\rVert_2$, falls below a tolerance $\\varepsilon$, or a maximum number of cycles $T_{\\max}$ is reached.\n\n**3. Simultaneous Gradient Descent (GD)**\n\nSimultaneous Gradient Descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm that updates all components of the vector $x$ at the same time. The update is performed by taking a step in the direction opposite to the gradient of the potential function.\n\nThe update rule for an iteration $t$ with a fixed step-size $\\alpha > 0$ is:\n$$\nx^{(t+1)} = x^{(t)} - \\alpha \\nabla \\Phi(x^{(t)})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the gradient, we get:\n$$\nx^{(t+1)} = x^{(t)} - \\alpha (Q x^{(t)} + c)\n$$\nFor GD to converge to the unique minimizer of a convex quadratic function, the step-size $\\alpha$ must be in the range $0 < \\alpha < 2/\\lambda_{\\max}(Q)$, where $\\lambda_{\\max}(Q)$ is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix $Q$. If $\\alpha$ is chosen outside this range, the algorithm may oscillate or diverge. The test suite includes a case where $\\alpha$ is deliberately chosen to be too large, leading to non-convergence. The stopping condition is the same as for BCD: $\\lVert x^{(t)} - x^\\star \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$ or the iteration count $t$ reaches the maximum budget $T_{\\max}$.\n\nThe implemented program consists of two primary functions, one for each algorithm, which take the problem parameters and return the number of iterations required for convergence. A main script iterates through the provided test cases, computes the exact solution $x^\\star$, runs a simulation for both BCD and GD, and formats the resulting iteration counts as specified.",
