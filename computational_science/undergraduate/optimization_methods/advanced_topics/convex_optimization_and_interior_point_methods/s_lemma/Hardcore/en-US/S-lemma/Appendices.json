A function might be non-negative only within a specific constrained region, but the S-lemma allows us to certify this property by constructing a new, related function that is non-negative everywhere. This exercise  provides a classic, intuitive example of this process, where you will explore a function that is positive on a disk but takes negative values outside of it, and then find the precise scalar multiplier that \"lifts\" the function to be globally non-negative.",

            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the required criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The vector variable is $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n- Two quadratic functions are defined as $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top} A \\mathbf{x} + a^{\\top} \\mathbf{x} + a_{0}$ and $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top} B \\mathbf{x} + b^{\\top} \\mathbf{x} + b_{0}$.\n- Parameters are specified as $A, B$ being symmetric matrices in $\\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$, vectors $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and scalars $a_{0},b_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- The S-lemma is described as asserting that if a strict feasibility condition holds for $g$, then $f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ on the set $\\{\\mathbf{x} : g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0\\}$ implies the existence of a nonnegative scalar $\\lambda$ such that $f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\lambda g(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$.\n- A specific instance is constructed with:\n  - $A = -I_{2}$ (where $I_{2}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix)\n  - $a = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$\n  - $a_{0} = 5$\n  - $B = I_{2}$\n  - $b = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$\n  - $b_{0} = -4$\n- The resulting functions are given as $f(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} + 5$ and $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} - 4$.\n- The tasks are:\n  1.

All mathematical objects (matrices, vectors, quadratic forms) are standard and well-defined. The problem is mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information to define the functions $f(\\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\\mathbf{x})$. The tasks are explicit and lead to the determination of a specific, unique value for the smallest $\\lambda$. The existence of a solution is guaranteed by the S-lemma under the conditions that the problem asks to be verified.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal mathematical language. It is free of any ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n- The problem is self-contained, consistent, and adheres to all criteria for validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe given parameters are $A = -I_{2}$, $a = \\mathbf{0}$, $a_{0} = 5$, $B = I_{2}$, $b = \\mathbf{0}$, and $b_{0} = -4$. For $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the quadratic functions are:\n$f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top}(-I_{2})\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{0}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x} + 5 = -\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x} + 5 = -\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} + 5$\n$g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top}(I_{2})\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{0}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x} - 4 = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top}\\mathbf{x} - 4 = \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} - 4$\nHere, $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|$ represents the Euclidean norm of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the feasible set and non-negativity of $f(\\mathbf{x})$**\n\nThe feasible set is defined by the inequality $g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0$.\n$g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0 \\implies \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} - 4 \\le 0 \\implies \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} \\le 4 \\implies \\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\le 2$.\nThe feasible set $S = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0\\}$ is the closed disk of radius $2$ centered at the origin.\n\nTo verify that the set is nonempty, we can observe that the origin $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$ satisfies the condition, since $\\|\\mathbf{0}\\| = 0 \\le 2$. Thus, $S$ is nonempty.\n\nThe strict feasibility condition requires the existence of a point $\\mathbf{x}_{0}$ such that $g(\\mathbf{x}_{0})  0$. Let us again choose the origin $\\mathbf{x}_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$. We compute $g(\\mathbf{0}) = \\|\\mathbf{0}\\|^{2} - 4 = 0 - 4 = -4$. Since $-4  0$, the strict feasibility condition (also known as Slater's condition) is satisfied.\n\nNext, we must show that $f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$ in the feasible set $S$. For any $\\mathbf{x} \\in S$, we have $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} \\le 4$. Multiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality: $-\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} \\ge -4$. Adding $5$ to both sides gives:\n$-\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} + 5 \\ge -4 + 5$\n$f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 1$\nSince $1  0$, it is certainly true that $f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ on the set $S$.\n\n**Part 2: Behavior of $f(\\mathbf{x})$ outside the feasible set**\n\nOutside the feasible set, we have $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|  2$. We need to show that $f(\\mathbf{x})$ can take negative values in this region.\n$f(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} + 5$.\nFor $f(\\mathbf{x})$ to be negative, we require:\n$-\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} + 5  0 \\implies 5  \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} \\implies \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|  \\sqrt{5}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$, the condition $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|  \\sqrt{5}$ is a stronger condition than $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|  2$. Any point $\\mathbf{x}$ satisfying $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|  \\sqrt{5}$ lies outside the feasible set $S$ and results in $f(\\mathbf{x})  0$.\nFor instance, consider the point $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$. Its norm is $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| = 3$, which is greater than $2$, so it is outside $S$.\nThe value of the function at this point is $f(\\begin{pmatrix}3 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}) = -\\| \\begin{pmatrix}3 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} \\|^{2} + 5 = -3^{2} + 5 = -9 + 5 = -4$.\nSince $-4  0$, this demonstrates that $f(\\mathbf{x})$ attains negative values outside the feasible set.\n\n**Part 3: Application of the S-lemma and determination of the smallest $\\lambda$**\n\nThe S-lemma for one quadratic constraint states that the implication\n$(g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0 \\implies f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0)$\nis equivalent to the existence of a scalar $\\lambda \\ge 0$ such that the function $f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\lambda g(\\mathbf{x})$ is globally nonnegative, i.e., $f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\lambda g(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This equivalence holds provided the strict feasibility condition (there exists $\\mathbf{x}_0$ with $g(\\mathbf{x}_0)  0$) is met.\n\nWe have already verified both the premise $(g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0 \\implies f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0)$ and the strict feasibility condition. Therefore, the S-lemma guarantees the existence of at least one $\\lambda \\ge 0$ that satisfies the global nonnegativity property. We now seek to find the smallest such $\\lambda$.\n\nLet us form the combined quadratic function $H(\\mathbf{x}, \\lambda) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\lambda g(\\mathbf{x})$:\n$H(\\mathbf{x}, \\lambda) = (-\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} + 5) + \\lambda (\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} - 4)$\nCombining terms, we get:\n$H(\\mathbf{x}, \\lambda) = (\\lambda - 1)\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} + (5 - 4\\lambda)$\n\nThis expression is a quadratic form in $\\mathbf{x}$. For $H(\\mathbf{x}, \\lambda)$ to be non-negative for all $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we must analyze its structure.\nThe function can be written as $\\mathbf{x}^{\\top} Q \\mathbf{x} + c$, where the matrix of the quadratic form is $Q = (\\lambda - 1)I_{2}$ and the constant term is $c = 5 - 4\\lambda$.\n\nFor $H(\\mathbf{x}, \\lambda) \\ge 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$, two conditions must be satisfied:\n1. The matrix $Q$ must be positive semidefinite ($Q \\succeq 0$). For a diagonal matrix like $Q = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda-1  0 \\\\ 0  \\lambda-1 \\end{pmatrix}$, this means its diagonal entries must be non-negative. This gives the condition $\\lambda - 1 \\ge 0$, which implies $\\lambda \\ge 1$. If this condition holds, the term $(\\lambda - 1)\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2}$ is always non-negative, and the function is bounded below.\n2. The global minimum of the function must be non-negative. When $\\lambda - 1 \\ge 0$, the quadratic term $(\\lambda - 1)\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2}$ is a convex function whose minimum value is $0$, achieved at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, the global minimum of $H(\\mathbf{x}, \\lambda)$ is its value at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$:\n$\\min_{\\mathbf{x}} H(\\mathbf{x}, \\lambda) = H(\\mathbf{0}, \\lambda) = (\\lambda - 1)\\|\\mathbf{0}\\|^{2} + (5 - 4\\lambda) = 5 - 4\\lambda$.\nFor global non-negativity, this minimum value must be greater than or equal to $0$:\n$5 - 4\\lambda \\ge 0 \\implies 5 \\ge 4\\lambda \\implies \\lambda \\le \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\nWe must satisfy both conditions simultaneously: $\\lambda \\ge 1$ and $\\lambda \\le \\frac{5}{4}$. The set of all values of $\\lambda$ for which $f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\lambda g(\\mathbf{x})$ is globally non-negative is the closed interval $[1, \\frac{5}{4}]$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest such non-negative scalar $\\lambda$. The smallest value in the interval $[1, \\frac{5}{4}]$ is $1$. This value also satisfies the requirement from the S-lemma that $\\lambda \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, the smallest value of $\\lambda$ is $1$.\nLet's check for $\\lambda=1$:\n$H(\\mathbf{x}, 1) = (1-1)\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^2 + (5 - 4(1)) = 0 + 1 = 1$.\nThe function is $H(\\mathbf{x},1)=1$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$, which is indeed non-negative.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of two quadratic functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, the validity of an implication between them, and the determination of a certifying scalar $\\lambda$ in the context of the S-lemma.\n\nThe quadratic functions are defined on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ as $f(x) = x^{\\top} A x + 2 b^{\\top} x + c$ and $g(x) = x^{\\top} B x + 2 d^{\\top} x + e$, with $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$. The given matrices and scalars are:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix},\\quad b = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\quad c = 1\n$$\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix},\\quad d = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\quad e = 1\n$$\nThis gives the explicit forms $f(x) = x_{1}^{2} + 2x_{2}^{2} - 2x_{1} + 1$ and $g(x) = -x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2} + 1$.\n\nThe tasks are addressed sequentially.\n\nTask 1: Determine if $f(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and compute its minimum.\nWe analyze $f(x)$ by completing the square:\n$$\nf(x) = (x_{1}^{2} - 2x_{1} + 1) + 2x_{2}^{2} = (x_{1} - 1)^{2} + 2x_{2}^{2}\n$$\nFor any real vector $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$, the term $(x_1 - 1)^2$ is non-negative, and the term $2x_2^2$ is non-negative. Therefore, their sum, $f(x)$, must be non-negative for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. So, $f(x) \\ge 0$ holds globally.\n\nThe minimum value of $f(x)$ is attained when both squared terms are zero. This occurs when $x_1 - 1 = 0$ (so $x_1=1$) and $x_2=0$. The minimum value is $f(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}) = (1-1)^2 + 2(0)^2 = 0$. Thus, $\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} f(x) = 0$.\n\nTo confirm this using the requested matrix-based definition, we check if the matrix $M_f = \\begin{pmatrix} A  b \\\\ b^{\\top}  c \\end{pmatrix}$ is positive semidefinite (PSD).\n$$\nM_f = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  -1 \\\\ 0  2  0 \\\\ -1  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA matrix is PSD if and only if all of its principal minors are non-negative.\nThe $1 \\times 1$ principal minors are the diagonal entries: $1 \\ge 0$, $2 \\ge 0$, $1 \\ge 0$.\nThe $2 \\times 2$ principal minors are:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 - 1 = 0 \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\ge 0\n$$\nThe $3 \\times 3$ principal minor is the determinant of $M_f$ itself:\n$$\n\\det(M_f) = 1(2 \\cdot 1 - 0) - 0 + (-1)(0 \\cdot 0 - 2(-1)) = 2 - 2 = 0 \\ge 0\n$$\nSince all principal minors are non-negative, $M_f$ is positive semidefinite, which confirms that $f(x)$ is globally non-negative. The fact that $\\det(M_f)=0$ indicates that the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $0$.\n\nTask 2: Determine if there exists $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $g(x)  0$.\nThe condition $g(x)  0$ translates to:\n$$\n-x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2} + 1  0 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad 1  x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}\n$$\nThis inequality describes the set of points in the plane that are strictly outside the unit circle centered at the origin. This set is clearly non-empty. For example, we can choose $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. For this point, we have $g(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}) = -2^2 - 0^2 + 1 = -4+1 = -3  0$. Therefore, such an $x$ exists. This is known as the strict feasibility condition, or Slater's condition, for the constraint $g(x) \\le 0$.\n\nTask 3: Decide if the implication $g(x) \\le 0 \\Rightarrow f(x) \\ge 0$ is trivial and find the smallest certifying scalar $\\lambda$.\nFrom Task 1, we established that $f(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. This means the conclusion of the implication is always true, regardless of the premise. Therefore, the implication $g(x) \\le 0 \\Rightarrow f(x) \\ge 0$ is true. It is \"trivial\" in the sense that the non-negativity of $f(x)$ does not depend on the constraint imposed by $g(x)$.\n\nThe S-lemma states that (given the strict feasibility from Task 2) the implication $g(x) \\le 0 \\Rightarrow f(x) \\ge 0$ is equivalent to the existence of a scalar $\\lambda \\ge 0$ such that $f(x) + \\lambda g(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. We need to find the smallest such non-negative $\\lambda$.\nThe condition is that the quadratic function $h(x, \\lambda) = f(x) + \\lambda g(x)$ must be globally non-negative. This is equivalent to its associated homogenized matrix $M(\\lambda)$ being positive semidefinite.\n$$\nh(x, \\lambda) = x^{\\top}(A + \\lambda B)x + 2(b + \\lambda d)^{\\top}x + (c + \\lambda e)\n$$\nThe matrix is $M(\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} A+\\lambda B  b+\\lambda d \\\\ (b+\\lambda d)^{\\top}  c+\\lambda e \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting the given parameters:\n$$\nM(\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda  0  -1 \\\\ 0  2-\\lambda  0 \\\\ -1  0  1+\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $M(\\lambda)$ to be PSD, we must have all its principal minors be non-negative. We seek the smallest $\\lambda \\ge 0$ that satisfies this. One of the $2 \\times 2$ principal minors gives the condition:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda  -1 \\\\ -1  1+\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\lambda)(1+\\lambda) - (-1)^2 = 1 - \\lambda^2 - 1 = -\\lambda^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nSince $\\lambda$ is a real number, $\\lambda^2 \\ge 0$, and thus $-\\lambda^2 \\le 0$. The only way to satisfy $-\\lambda^2 \\ge 0$ is if $\\lambda^2=0$, which implies $\\lambda=0$.\nWe must verify that $\\lambda=0$ satisfies all other PSD conditions. For $\\lambda=0$, $M(0) = M_f = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  -1 \\\\ 0  2  0 \\\\ -1  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. As shown in Task 1, this matrix is indeed positive semidefinite.\nSince the conditions require $\\lambda=0$, and $\\lambda=0$ is a valid choice, the smallest non-negative certifying scalar is $\\lambda = 0$.\n\nTask 4: Derive general conditions for $\\lambda=0$ to suffice.\nThe task is to find structural conditions on a general quadratic $f(x) = x^{\\top} A x + 2 b^{\\top} x + c$ such that $\\lambda=0$ certifies the implication $g(x) \\le 0 \\Rightarrow f(x) \\ge 0$ for any quadratic $g(x)$ that admits a strictly feasible point.\nAccording to the S-lemma, choosing $\\lambda=0$ as the certificate means that the statement $f(x) + 0 \\cdot g(x) \\ge 0$ must hold for all $x$. This simplifies to:\n$$\nf(x) \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\n$$\nThis condition is that $f(x)$ must be globally non-negative. This condition is independent of $g(x)$, so if it holds, it holds for all valid $g(x)$.\nThe structural condition on $A$, $b$, and $c$ for $f(x)$ to be globally non-negative is that the $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ matrix formed by homogenizing the quadratic function must be positive semidefinite. This matrix is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A  b \\\\ b^{\\top}  c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTherefore, the condition is that this matrix must be positive semidefinite, which is written as $\\begin{pmatrix} A  b \\\\ b^{\\top}  c \\end{pmatrix} \\succeq 0$. This is a standard condition expressed in terms of the objects defining the function and the concept of positive semidefiniteness from linear algebra.\n\nThe problem asks for the single numerical value of the smallest certifying scalar $\\lambda$ from the specific case analysis.",

Derive, from first principles and using the S-lemma as the central equivalence tool, a closed-form expression for the minimal value of $f(\\mathbf{x})$ over $\\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : g(\\mathbf{x}) = -1\\}$ in terms of the generalized eigenvalues of the matrix pencil $(A,-B)$. Then compute this value explicitly for the given $A$ and $B$.\n\nYour final reported quantity must be the exact minimal value of $f(\\mathbf{x})$ under the normalized constraint $g(\\mathbf{x}) = -1$. No rounding is required. Express your final answer as a single real number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is well-posed and scientifically sound.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Homogeneous quadratic functions: $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top} A \\mathbf{x}$ and $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top} B \\mathbf{x}$, for $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n- Real symmetric matrices:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4  1 \\\\\n1  2\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-3  0 \\\\\n0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n- The Slater condition is assumed to hold for the inequality $g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0$, i.e., there exists a point $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$ such that $g(\\bar{\\mathbf{x}})  0$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a standard exercise in quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) and the theory of the S-lemma.\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established mathematical principles of linear algebra, matrix analysis, and optimization theory. The S-lemma is a fundamental result in this area.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined with all necessary data. The matrices $A$ and $B$ are specified, and the objective functions and constraints are unambiguous. The Slater condition is explicitly given. We can verify it: $g(\\mathbf{x}) = -3x_1^2 - x_2^2$. For any non-zero $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$, e.g., $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}} = (1, 0)^{\\top}$, we have $g(\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}) = -3  0$. The condition holds.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise and objective mathematical language.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and free from contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. We address them sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the optimization problem over the cone $\\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0 \\}$**\n\nThe first optimization problem is\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} f(\\mathbf{x}) \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0.\n$$\nThe constraint is $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top} B \\mathbf{x} = -3x_1^2 - x_2^2 \\le 0$. The matrix $B$ is negative definite, as its eigenvalues are $-3$ and $-1$. Consequently, the inequality $g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0$ holds for all $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The feasible set is the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The problem is therefore equivalent to an unconstrained minimization of $f(\\mathbf{x})$ over $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top} A \\mathbf{x}$ is a quadratic form. Its properties are determined by the matrix $A$. The eigenvalues of $A$ are given by the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 4-\\lambda  1 \\\\ 1  2-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (4-\\lambda)(2-\\lambda)-1 = \\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 7 = 0.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 28}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$. Both eigenvalues are positive, so the matrix $A$ is positive definite ($A \\succ 0$).\n\nSince $A$ is positive definite, $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\top}A\\mathbf{x}  0$ for all $\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, and $f(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$. The global minimum of $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is therefore $0$, achieved at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$. The point $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in the feasible set, as $g(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$. Thus, the minimal value is finite and is equal to $0$.\n\nThe homogeneity of $f$ and $g$ means that if there were a feasible point $\\mathbf{x}_0$ with $f(\\mathbf{x}_0)  0$, then for any scalar $\\alpha  0$, $\\alpha \\mathbf{x}_0$ would also be feasible and $f(\\alpha \\mathbf{x}_0) = \\alpha^2 f(\\mathbf{x}_0)$. As $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, the objective would be unbounded below (infimum of $-\\infty$). To determine if this is the case, we can use the S-lemma.\n\nThe S-lemma states that for two quadratic forms $f(\\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\\mathbf{x})$, the implication $g(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 0 \\implies f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ holds if and only if there exists a scalar $\\tau \\ge 0$ such that $A - \\tau(-B) \\succeq 0$, i.e., $A+\\tau B \\succeq 0$, provided the Slater condition holds. Let us check this condition:\n$$\nA + \\tau B = \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} - \\tau \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4+3\\tau  1 \\\\ 1  2+\\tau \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFor this matrix to be positive semidefinite for some $\\tau \\ge 0$, its principal minors must be non-negative.\n1.  $4+3\\tau \\ge 0$ (true for $\\tau \\ge 0$).\n2.  $\\det(A+\\tau B) = (4+3\\tau)(2+\\tau) - 1 = 3\\tau^2 + 10\\tau + 7 \\ge 0$.\nThe roots of $3\\tau^2 + 10\\tau + 7 = 0$ are $\\tau = \\frac{-10 \\pm 4}{6}$, which are $\\tau_1 = -1$ and $\\tau_2 = -7/3$. Since the parabola opens upwards, the quadratic is non-negative for $\\tau \\in (-\\infty, -7/3] \\cup [-1, \\infty)$.\nWe need to find if there exists a $\\tau \\ge 0$ that satisfies this. Any $\\tau \\ge 0$ lies in the interval $[-1, \\infty)$. For example, $\\tau=0$ works, since $A$ is positive definite.\nThe S-lemma confirms that $f(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$ in the feasible set. The minimum value is thus $0$, achieved at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of the optimization problem over the level set $\\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : g(\\mathbf{x}) = -1 \\}$**\n\nThe second optimization problem is to find the minimal value of $f(\\mathbf{x})$ subject to the equality constraint $g(\\mathbf{x}) = -1$:\n$$\n\\gamma^* = \\min_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} \\mathbf{x}^{\\top} A \\mathbf{x} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{x}^{\\top} B \\mathbf{x} = -1.\n$$\nThe constraint $\\mathbf{x}^{\\top} B \\mathbf{x} = -1$ is equivalent to $-3x_1^2 - x_2^2 = -1$, or $3x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 1$. This defines a compact set (an ellipse), so a minimum value is guaranteed to exist.\n\nThis problem is a QCQP with one equality constraint. We can find its solution using the S-lemma framework, which for this class of problems is equivalent to analyzing the Lagrange dual. The minimal value $\\gamma^*$ is the supremum of all $\\gamma$ such that the statement \"$\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}A\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\gamma$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$ with $\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}B\\mathbf{x} = -1$\" is true. This can be rewritten as:\n$\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}A\\mathbf{x} - \\gamma \\ge 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$ satisfying $\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}B\\mathbf{x} + 1 = 0$.\n\nWe homogenize the problem by introducing a variable $t$, letting $\\mathbf{z} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{x} \\\\ t \\end{pmatrix}$. The condition becomes $\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}A\\mathbf{x} - \\gamma t^2 \\ge 0$ for all $(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ such that $\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}B\\mathbf{x} + t^2 = 0$. This can be written in terms of quadratic forms in $\\mathbf{z}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{z}^{\\top} \\begin{pmatrix} A  \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}^{\\top}  -\\gamma \\end{pmatrix} \\mathbf{z} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\mathbf{z} \\text{ such that } \\quad \\mathbf{z}^{\\top} \\begin{pmatrix} B  \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}^{\\top}  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\mathbf{z} = 0.\n$$\nBy the S-lemma for equality constraints (a result also known as Finsler's Lemma), this implication holds if and only if there exists a scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A  \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}^{\\top}  -\\gamma \\end{pmatrix} + \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} B  \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}^{\\top}  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\succeq 0.\n$$\nThis block-diagonal matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if both diagonal blocks are positive semidefinite:\n1.  $A + \\lambda B \\succeq 0$.\n2.  $-\\gamma + \\lambda \\ge 0 \\implies \\gamma \\le \\lambda$.\n\nSo, for $\\gamma$ to be a lower bound for the objective function, there must exist a $\\lambda$ such that $A+\\lambda B \\succeq 0$ and $\\gamma \\le \\lambda$. We seek the minimal value $\\gamma^*$, which is the tightest (largest) such lower bound. This is given by the solution to the dual problem:\n$$\n\\gamma^* = \\max \\{ \\gamma \\mid \\exists \\lambda \\text{ s.t. } A+\\lambda B \\succeq 0 \\text{ and } \\gamma \\le \\lambda \\}.\n$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum of $\\lambda$ over the set where $A+\\lambda B \\succeq 0$.\n$$\n\\gamma^* = \\max \\{ \\lambda \\mid A+\\lambda B \\succeq 0 \\}.\n$$\nLet's analyze the condition $A+\\lambda B \\succeq 0$:\n$$\nA + \\lambda B = \\begin{pmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} + \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4-3\\lambda  1 \\\\ 1  2-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if its principal minors are non-negative:\n1.  $4-3\\lambda \\ge 0 \\implies \\lambda \\le 4/3$.\n2.  $\\det(A+\\lambda B) = (4-3\\lambda)(2-\\lambda) - 1 = 3\\lambda^2 - 10\\lambda + 7 \\ge 0$.\nThe roots of $3\\lambda^2 - 10\\lambda + 7 = 0$ are $\\lambda = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100-84}}{6} = \\frac{10 \\pm 4}{6}$, which gives $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 7/3$. The quadratic is non-negative for $\\lambda \\in (-\\infty, 1] \\cup [7/3, \\infty)$.\n\nWe must satisfy both $\\lambda \\le 4/3$ and ($\\lambda \\le 1$ or $\\lambda \\ge 7/3$). The intersection of these conditions is $\\lambda \\le 1$. The set of feasible $\\lambda$ is $(-\\infty, 1]$.\nThe dual problem is to find $\\max\\{\\lambda \\mid \\lambda \\in (-\\infty, 1] \\}$. The maximum value is $1$.\nBy strong duality, which holds for this problem, the optimal value of the primal problem is equal to the optimal value of the dual problem. Thus, $\\gamma^* = 1$.\n\nThis result can be expressed in terms of the generalized eigenvalues of the matrix pencil $(A, -B)$. A generalized eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $(A, -B)$ is a root of $\\det(A - \\lambda(-B)) = \\det(A+\\lambda B) = 0$. As computed above, these eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 7/3$.\nThe condition $A+\\lambda B \\succeq 0$ is equivalent to $A-\\lambda(-B) \\succeq 0$. Since $-B$ is positive definite, this holds if and only if $\\lambda$ is less than or equal to the smallest generalized eigenvalue of the pair $(A, -B)$. That is, $\\lambda \\le \\lambda_{\\min}(A, -B)$.\nThe dual problem seeks to maximize $\\lambda$ subject to this condition. The maximum is therefore $\\lambda = \\lambda_{\\min}(A, -B)$.\nThe minimal value of $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is thus the smallest generalized eigenvalue of the pencil $(A, -B)$.\nThe generalized eigenvalues are $1$ and $7/3$. The smallest is $1$.\n\nThe minimal value of $f(\\mathbf{x})$ over $\\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : g(\\mathbf{x}) = -1\\}$ is $1$.",
