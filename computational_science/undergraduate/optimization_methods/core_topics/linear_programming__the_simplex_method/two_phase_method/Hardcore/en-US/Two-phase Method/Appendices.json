            "problem": "A nutritionist is creating a diet plan using two food supplements, Supplement A and Supplement B. Let $x_1$ represent the number of servings of Supplement A and $x_2$ represent the number of servings of Supplement B. Both $x_1$ and $x_2$ must be non-negative.\n\nThe nutritional information and daily requirements are as follows:\n- Each serving of Supplement A provides 1 unit of Vitamin P and 2 units of Vitamin Q.\n- Each serving of Supplement B provides 1 unit of Vitamin P, but its metabolic processing consumes 1 unit of Vitamin Q.\n- The diet must provide a total of at least 5 units of Vitamin P and at least 1 unit of Vitamin Q.\n\nThis leads to a system of linear inequalities that define the feasible region of diet plans $(x_1, x_2)$. To find an initial valid plan, we can apply the Phase I procedure of the two-phase simplex method.\n\nUsing the Phase I procedure, determine the first basic feasible solution $(x_1, x_2)$ for the original problem. Your answer should be the values for $x_1$ and $x_2$.",

The initial basic variables are $a_{1}=5$ and $a_{2}=1$ with $x_{1}=x_{2}=s_{1}=s_{2}=0$. To express the objective function in terms of non-basic variables, we substitute for $a_1$ and $a_2$ from the constraints, which gives the initial objective row $w+3x_{1}-s_{1}-s_{2}=6$, or\n$$\nw=6-3x_{1}+s_{1}+s_{2}.\n$$\nBecause the reduced cost of $x_{1}$ is positive (3), increasing $x_{1}$ decreases $w$, so choose $x_{1}$ to enter. Apply the ratio test on rows with positive $x_{1}$ coefficients: row 1 gives $\\frac{5}{1}=5$, row 2 gives $\\frac{1}{2}$; thus $a_{2}$ leaves and we pivot on row 2.\n\nDivide row 2 by $2$:\n$$\nx_{1}-\\frac{1}{2}x_{2}-\\frac{1}{2}s_{2}+\\frac{1}{2}a_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nEliminate $x_{1}$ from row 1 and the $w$-row. Row 1 minus the above gives\n$$\n\\frac{3}{2}x_{2}-s_{1}+\\frac{1}{2}s_{2}+a_{1}-\\frac{1}{2}a_{2}=\\frac{9}{2}.\n$$\nUpdating the objective by subtracting 3 times the pivot row from the $w$-row yields\n$$\nw+\\frac{3}{2}x_{2}-s_{1}+\\frac{1}{2}s_{2}-\\frac{3}{2}a_{2}=\\frac{9}{2}.\n$$\nNow choose $x_{2}$ to enter (as it has a positive reduced cost), and use the ratio test: only row 1 has a positive $x_{2}$ coefficient, with ratio $\\frac{9/2}{3/2}=3$, so $a_{1}$ leaves. Pivot on row 1 by dividing it by $\\frac{3}{2}$:\n$$\nx_{2}-\\frac{2}{3}s_{1}+\\frac{1}{3}s_{2}+\\frac{2}{3}a_{1}-\\frac{1}{3}a_{2}=3.\n$$\nEliminate $x_{2}$ from the other rows.

            "solution": "The task is to prepare a given Linear Program (LP) for the two-phase simplex method, and then to execute Phase I to find the minimum value of the Phase I objective function. This process involves transforming the problem into equality-standard form, introducing necessary variables, and applying the simplex algorithm.\n\nThe initial LP is defined by the objective to maximize $Z = x_{1} + 3x_{2}$, subject to the constraints:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_{1} + 2x_{2} \\leq 6 \\\\\n-x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq -2 \\\\\nx_{1} - x_{2} = 2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith non-negativity conditions $x_{1} \\ge 0$ and $x_{2} \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Conversion to Equality-Standard Form**\n\nThe goal is to convert the system of inequalities and equalities into a system of pure equalities of the form $A'x' = b'$, where all variables in the vector $x'$ are non-negative ($x' \\ge 0$) and the right-hand side vector $b'$ is also non-negative ($b' \\ge 0$).\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: $x_{1} + 2x_{2} \\leq 6$**\n    This is a \"less than or equal to\" inequality. To convert it into an equality, we introduce a non-negative **slack variable**, denoted by $s_{1} \\geq 0$. The slack variable represents the unused amount of the resource.\n    $$x_{1} + 2x_{2} + s_{1} = 6$$\n    The variable $s_{1}$ provides a column $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for the initial basis.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: $-x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq -2$**\n    First, we must ensure the right-hand side (RHS) is non-negative, as required for the standard form. We multiply the entire inequality by $-1$, which reverses the inequality sign:\n    $$(-1)(-x_{1} + x_{2}) \\leq (-1)(-2) \\implies x_{1} - x_{2} \\leq 2$$\n    This is now a \"less than or equal to\" inequality. We introduce another non-negative slack variable, $s_{2} \\geq 0$, to convert it to an equality:\n    $$x_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2} = 2$$\n    The problem statement mentions **surplus variables**, which are used for \"greater than or equal to\" constraints with a non-negative RHS. For example, $a^T x \\ge b$ (with $b \\ge 0$) becomes $a^T x - s = b$. In this problem, after ensuring a non-negative RHS, the constraint became a $\\le$ type, thus requiring a slack variable instead of a surplus one. The variable $s_{2}$ provides a column $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for the initial basis.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: $x_{1} - x_{2} = 2$**\n    This is already an equality. However, to begin the simplex method, we need an initial Basic Feasible Solution (BFS), which is typically found by identifying an identity submatrix within the constraint matrix. The existing variables ($x_1, x_2, s_1, s_2$) do not provide a unit vector for this third constraint row. Therefore, we introduce a non-negative **artificial variable**, $a_{1} \\ge 0$.\n    $$x_{1} - x_{2} + a_{1} = 2$$\n    The artificial variable $a_{1}$ has no physical meaning and is a purely mathematical tool to obtain an initial BFS. It provides the column $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ needed to complete the initial identity basis.\n\nThe complete system in equality-standard form is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_{1} + 2x_{2} + s_{1} = 6 \\\\\nx_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2} = 2 \\\\\nx_{1} - x_{2} + a_{1} = 2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith all variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1} \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Phase I Setup**\n\nThe two-phase method is employed because of the presence of an artificial variable. Phase I has the sole objective of determining if a feasible solution to the original problem exists. This is achieved by minimizing the sum of all artificial variables. If the minimum value of this sum is $0$, then all artificial variables are zero, and we have found a BFS for the original problem. If the minimum is greater than $0$, the original problem is infeasible.\n\nIn this case, we have one artificial variable, $a_{1}$. The Phase I objective is to minimize $W = a_{1}$.\nThe simplex method is typically formulated as a maximization problem. Minimizing $W$ is equivalent to maximizing $-W$. Let the Phase I objective function be $Z_{I} = -W = -a_{1}$.\n\nTo use the simplex tableau, the objective function must be expressed solely in terms of non-basic variables. Initially, the basic variables are $\\{s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1}\\}$ (forming an identity matrix), and the non-basic variables are $\\{x_{1}, x_{2}\\}$.\nFrom the third constraint, we express $a_{1}$ in terms of non-basic variables:\n$$a_{1} = 2 - x_{1} + x_{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the objective function $Z_{I}$:\n$$Z_{I} = -a_{1} = -(2 - x_{1} + x_{2}) = x_{1} - x_{2} - 2$$\nThe equation for the objective row in the simplex tableau is therefore $Z_{I} - x_{1} + x_{2} = -2$.\n\n**Step 3: Simplex Method for Phase I**\n\nWe construct the initial simplex tableau. The rows correspond to the basic variables $\\{s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1}\\}$ and the objective function $Z_{I}$.\nInitial Tableau:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  Z_{I}  x_{1}  x_{2}  s_{1}  s_{2}  a_{1}  \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\ns_{1}  0  1  2  1  0  0  6 \\\\\ns_{2}  0  1  -1  0  1  0  2 \\\\\na_{1}  0  1  -1  0  0  1  2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Obj}  1  -1  1  0  0  0  -2\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe initial BFS is $x_{1}=0, x_{2}=0, s_{1}=6, s_{2}=2, a_{1}=2$. The initial Phase I objective value is $W=a_{1}=2$, or $Z_{I}=-2$.\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n1.  **Select Entering Variable:** The entering variable is the non-basic variable with the most negative coefficient in the objective row. This is $x_{1}$ with a coefficient of $-1$.\n\n2.  **Select Leaving Variable (Min-Ratio Test):** We compute the ratio of the RHS to the corresponding positive coefficient in the entering variable's column ($x_{1}$).\n    *   Row $s_{1}$: $\\frac{6}{1} = 6$\n    *   Row $s_{2}$: $\\frac{2}{1} = 2$\n    *   Row $a_{1}$: $\\frac{2}{1} = 2$\n    There is a tie between the $s_{2}$ row and the $a_{1}$ row. A common tie-breaking rule is to choose the row that will drive an artificial variable out of the basis. We select $a_{1}$ as the leaving variable.\n\n3.  **Pivot Operation:** The pivot element is the entry in the entering column ($x_{1}$) and leaving row ($a_{1}$), which is $1$. We perform row operations to make the pivot column a unit vector with $1$ in the pivot position.\n    *   The pivot row (new $x_{1}$ row) is already in the desired form, since the pivot is $1$: $R'_{x_{1}} = R_{a_{1}}$.\n    *   New $s_{1}$ row: $R'_{s_{1}} = R_{s_{1}} - (1) R'_{x_{1}} \\implies (1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 6) - (1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2) = (0, 3, 1, 0, -1, 4)$.\n    *   New $s_{2}$ row: $R'_{s_{2}} = R_{s_{2}} - (1) R'_{x_{1}} \\implies (1, -1, 0, 1, 0, 2) - (1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2) = (0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0)$.\n    *   New objective row: $R'_{\\text{Obj}} = R_{\\text{Obj}} - (-1) R'_{x_{1}} \\implies (-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -2) + (1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)$.\n\nThe resulting tableau is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  Z_{I}  x_{1}  x_{2}  s_{1}  s_{2}  a_{1}  \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\ns_{1}  0  0  3  1  0  -1  4 \\\\\ns_{2}  0  0  0  0  1  -1  0 \\\\\nx_{1}  0  1  -1  0  0  1  2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Obj}  1  0  0  0  0  1  0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nAll coefficients in the objective row are now non-negative ($\\ge 0$). This indicates that the optimal solution for the Phase I problem has been reached.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe optimal value of the Phase I objective function $Z_{I}$ is found in the RHS column of the objective row, which is $0$.\nSince $Z_{I} = -W = -a_{1}$, we have:\n$$Z_{I, \\text{max}} = 0 \\implies -W_{\\text{min}} = 0 \\implies W_{\\text{min}} = 0$$\nThe minimum value of the Phase I objective, which is the sum of the artificial variables ($W=a_{1}$), is $0$. This confirms that the original LP is feasible. The final BFS found at the end of Phase I is $x_{1}=2, s_{1}=4, s_{2}=0$ (and non-basic $x_{2}=0, a_{1}=0$). The problem asks only for the minimum value of the Phase I objective.",
