By analyzing a set of constraints that includes a non-linear relationship, you will determine the precise threshold for a parameter $\\alpha$ that makes the feasible region non-empty .

A point $x$ is called feasible for a given parameter $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ if it also satisfies the linear inequality $x_{1} + x_{2} \\le \\alpha$. Using only the foundational definition that a feasible region is the set of points that simultaneously satisfy all constraints, determine the smallest real number $\\alpha^{\\ast}$ such that there exists at least one feasible point if and only if $\\alpha \\ge \\alpha^{\\ast}$. Provide $\\alpha^{\\ast}$ in exact form as a single real number. Do not round your answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires finding the smallest real number $\\alpha^{\\ast}$ such that a feasible region, defined by a set of inequalities, is non-empty if and only if a parameter $\\alpha$ satisfies $\\alpha \\ge \\alpha^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe set of all constraints for a point $x = (x_{1}, x_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to be considered feasible is given by:\n1. $x_{1} \\ge 0$\n2. $x_{2} \\ge 0$\n3. $x_{1}x_{2} \\ge 1$\n4. $x_{1} + x_{2} \\le \\alpha$\n\nFor the set of feasible points to be non-empty, there must exist at least one point $(x_{1}, x_{2})$ that satisfies all four inequalities simultaneously. Let the set of points satisfying the first three constraints be denoted by $S$.\n$S = \\{ (x_{1}, x_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_{1} \\ge 0, x_{2} \\ge 0, x_{1}x_{2} \\ge 1 \\}$.\nThe feasible region is the intersection of the set $S$ and the half-plane defined by $x_{1} + x_{2} \\le \\alpha$. This intersection is non-empty if and only if there is at least one point in $S$ for which the sum $x_{1} + x_{2}$ is less than or equal to $\\alpha$.\n\nThis condition can be rephrased. The smallest value of $\\alpha$ for which the feasible region is non-empty must be the minimum possible value of the sum $x_1 + x_2$ for any point $(x_1, x_2)$ in the set $S$. Let this minimum value be $\\alpha^{\\ast}$.\nIf $\\alpha < \\alpha^{\\ast}$, then for any $(x_1, x_2) \\in S$, we have $x_1 + x_2 \\ge \\alpha^{\\ast} > \\alpha$, so the constraint $x_1 + x_2 \\le \\alpha$ can never be satisfied. The feasible region is empty.\nIf $\\alpha \\ge \\alpha^{\\ast}$, then the point $(x_1^{\\ast}, x_2^{\\ast}) \\in S$ that achieves the minimum sum $\\alpha^{\\ast}$ will satisfy $x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast} = \\alpha^{\\ast} \\le \\alpha$. This point is therefore in the feasible region, making it non-empty.\n\nConsequently, the problem is equivalent to solving the following optimization problem:\nFind the minimum value of the function $f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1} + x_{2}$ subject to the constraints $x_{1} \\ge 0$, $x_{2} \\ge 0$, and $x_{1}x_{2} \\ge 1$.\n\nWe can solve this using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, the following holds:\n$$ \\frac{a+b}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{ab} $$\nEquality holds if and only if $a=b$.\n\nFrom the constraints, we have $x_{1} \\ge 0$ and $x_{2} \\ge 0$. The constraint $x_{1}x_{2} \\ge 1$ implies that neither $x_{1}$ nor $x_{2}$ can be zero, so we must have $x_{1} > 0$ and $x_{2} > 0$. We can therefore apply the AM-GM inequality with $a = x_{1}$ and $b = x_{2}$:\n$$ \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} $$\nMultiplying by $2$, we get:\n$$ x_{1} + x_{2} \\ge 2\\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} $$\nWe are also given the constraint $x_{1}x_{2} \\ge 1$. Since the square root function is monotonically increasing for non-negative arguments, we can take the square root of both sides of this inequality:\n$$ \\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} \\ge \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$\nCombining the two results, we have:\n$$ x_{1} + x_{2} \\ge 2\\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} \\ge 2(1) = 2 $$\nThis shows that for any point $(x_{1}, x_{2})$ satisfying the first three constraints, the sum $x_{1} + x_{2}$ must be greater than or equal to $2$. The minimum possible value for this sum is $2$.\n\nThis minimum value is achieved when the equality conditions for both inequalities are met.\n1. The equality in the AM-GM inequality ($x_{1} + x_{2} = 2\\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}}$) holds if and only if $x_{1} = x_{2}$.\n2. The equality in the second step ($\\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}} = 1$) holds if and only if $x_{1}x_{2} = 1$.\n\nTo find the point where the minimum is achieved, we solve the system of equations:\n$$ x_{1} = x_{2} $$\n$$ x_{1}x_{2} = 1 $$\nSubstituting the first equation into the second gives $x_{1}^{2} = 1$. Since we know $x_{1} > 0$, we must have $x_{1} = 1$. This implies $x_{2} = 1$.\n\nAt the point $(1, 1)$, the constraints are satisfied: $1 \\ge 0$, $1 \\ge 0$, and $(1)(1) = 1 \\ge 1$. The value of the sum is $x_{1} + x_{2} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nThis confirms that the minimum value of $x_{1} + x_{2}$ subject to the constraints is indeed $2$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest real number $\\alpha^{\\ast}$ for which the feasible region is non-empty is $2$.\nFor any $\\alpha \\ge 2$, the point $(1, 1)$ is a feasible point. For any $\\alpha < 2$, no point can satisfy all constraints.\nThe value of $\\alpha^{\\ast}$ is thus $2$.",

The stationarity conditions become $x_1 - 2.2 + \\lambda = 0$ and $x_2 + 0.4 + \\lambda = 0$.

This gives the candidate point $x=(2.3, -0.3)$. However, this point violates the primal feasibility condition $x_2 \\ge 0.5$.\n\n**Case 2: The constraint $x_1 \\geq 1$ is active ($x_1=1$), and $x_2 \\geq 0.5$ is inactive ($x_2 > 0.5$).**\nFrom $x_1=1$, the equality constraint $x_1+x_2=2$ gives $x_2=1$.

The candidate point is $(1.5, 0.5)$, which is primally feasible. Complementary slackness implies $\\mu_1=0$. The stationarity conditions are $(1.5 - 2.2) + \\lambda = 0$ and $(0.5 + 0.4) + \\lambda - \\mu_2 = 0$. The first equation gives $\\lambda = 0.7$.

For any vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, it is a standard inequality that $\\|x\\|_{2} \\le \\|x\\|_{1}$.\n\n*   **Necessity**: Suppose the feasible set $S$ is nonempty.

We need to show that $S$ is nonempty by constructing a feasible point. Let's consider the point $x_c = (\\alpha, 0, \\ldots, 0)$. Its norms are:\n    $$ \\|x_c\\|_{1} = |\\alpha| + 0 + \\dots + 0 = \\alpha $$\n    $$ \\|x_c\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 0^2} = \\alpha $$\n    We check if $x_c$ is in $S$:\n    1.  $\\|x_c\\|_{1} \\le \\alpha \\implies \\alpha \\le \\alpha$, which is true.\n    2.  $\\|x_c\\|_{2} \\ge \\beta \\implies \\alpha \\ge \\beta$, which is true by our assumption.\n    Since both constraints are satisfied, $x_c \\in S$, and the set is nonempty.\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition for the feasible region to be nonempty is $\\alpha \\ge \\beta$.\n\n**Part 2: Geometric Characterization for n=2**\nFor $n=2$, the feasible region is $S = \\{(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : |x_1| + |x_2| \\le \\alpha \\text{ and } x_1^2 + x_2^2 \\ge \\beta^2\\}$. This is the intersection of a solid square (the $\\ell_1$-ball) centered at the origin with vertices at $(\\pm\\alpha, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm\\alpha)$, and the exterior of a circle of radius $\\beta$ centered at the origin. The resulting shape is a square with a circular \"hole\" at its center.\n\n*   **Boundedness**: Since $S$ is a subset of the $\\ell_1$-ball, which is a bounded set, $S$ is also bounded.\n*   **Convexity**: If $\\beta > 0$, the set is not convex. For example, if $\\alpha \\ge \\beta > 0$, the points $x_a = (\\beta, 0)$ and $x_b = (-\\beta, 0)$ are in $S$. However, their midpoint, the origin $(0,0)$, is not in $S$ because its $\\ell_2$-norm is $0$, which is less than $\\beta$.\n*   **Connectedness**: The region is path-connected. The portions of the set in each of the four quadrants are connected to their neighbors along the coordinate axes. For example, the set of points on the positive y-axis within $S$ is $\\{(0, y) \\mid \\beta \\le y \\le \\alpha\\}$, which is a non-empty line segment since $\\alpha \\ge \\beta$. This segment connects the portions of $S$ in the first and second quadrants.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of c**\nThe constant $c$ is defined as\n$$\nc \\;=\\; \\sup\\left\\{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} \\;:\\; \\text{the feasible set is nonempty with } \\alpha>0 \\right\\}.\n$$\nFrom Part 1, the condition for the set to be nonempty is $\\alpha \\ge \\beta$.
