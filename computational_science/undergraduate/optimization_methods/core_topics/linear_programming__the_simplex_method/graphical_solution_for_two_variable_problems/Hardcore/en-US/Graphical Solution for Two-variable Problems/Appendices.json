            "solution": "The problem is a linear optimization task, which requires minimizing the objective function $f(x,y) = x+y$ subject to a set of linear inequality constraints. The method specified is a graphical approach, which is suitable for problems with two variables. The core principle of this method is that the optimal value of a linear objective function over a non-empty, closed, and bounded feasible region must occur at one of the vertices (extreme points) of that region.\n\nFirst, we identify the feasible region defined by the four constraints:\n$C_1: x \\ge 0$\n$C_2: y \\ge 0$\n$C_3: x+y \\le 1$\n$C_4: x \\le 0.7$\n\nThe feasible region is the set of all points $(x,y)$ in the Cartesian plane that simultaneously satisfy all four inequalities. The boundaries of this region are defined by the lines corresponding to these constraints:\n$L_1: x = 0$ (the y-axis)\n$L_2: y = 0$ (the x-axis)\n$L_3: x+y = 1$\n$L_4: x = 0.7$\n\nThe feasible region is a convex polygon whose vertices are the points of intersection of these boundary lines, provided these points satisfy all constraints. We find these vertices by solving systems of linear equations for pairs of boundary lines.\n\nVertex $V_A$: Intersection of $L_1$ and $L_2$.\nSolving $x=0$ and $y=0$ gives the point $(0,0)$. This point satisfies $0+0 \\le 1$ and $0 \\le 0.7$. Thus, $V_A = (0,0)$ is a vertex of the feasible polygon. At this vertex, the constraints $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$ are binding (i.e., satisfied as equalities).\n\nVertex $V_B$: Intersection of $L_2$ and $L_4$.\nSolving $y=0$ and $x=0.7$ gives the point $(0.7,0)$. This point satisfies $x \\ge 0$ (since $0.7 \\ge 0$) and $x+y \\le 1$ (since $0.7+0 \\le 1$). Thus, $V_B = (0.7,0)$ is a vertex. At this vertex, the constraints $y \\ge 0$ and $x \\le 0.7$ are binding.\n\nVertex $V_C$: Intersection of $L_3$ and $L_4$.\nSolving $x+y=1$ and $x=0.7$ gives $0.7+y=1$, which yields $y=0.3$. The point is $(0.7,0.3)$. This point satisfies $x \\ge 0$ (since $0.7 \\ge 0$) and $y \\ge 0$ (since $0.3 \\ge 0$). Thus, $V_C = (0.7,0.3)$ is a vertex. At this vertex, the constraints $x+y \\le 1$ and $x \\le 0.7$ are simultaneously binding. This is the specific vertex identified in the problem statement.\n\nVertex $V_D$: Intersection of $L_1$ and $L_3$.\nSolving $x=0$ and $x+y=1$ gives $y=1$. The point is $(0,1)$. This point satisfies $y \\ge 0$ (since $1 \\ge 0$) and $x \\le 0.7$ (since $0 \\le 0.7$). Thus, $V_D = (0,1)$ is a vertex. At this vertex, the constraints $x \\ge 0$ and $x+y \\le 1$ are binding.\n\nWe have identified all the vertices of the feasible polygon: $V_A=(0,0)$, $V_B=(0.7,0)$, $V_C=(0.7,0.3)$, and $V_D=(0,1)$. These points, connected in order, form a quadrilateral in the $xy$-plane.\n\nAccording to the fundamental theorem of linear programming, the minimum value of the linear objective function $f(x,y)=x+y$ must occur at one of these vertices. We evaluate the function at each vertex:\nAt $V_A=(0,0)$: $f(0,0) = 0+0 = 0$.\nAt $V_B=(0.7,0)$: $f(0.7,0) = 0.7+0 = 0.7$.\nAt $V_C=(0.7,0.3)$: $f(0.7,0.3) = 0.7+0.3 = 1$.\nAt $V_D=(0,1)$: $f(0,1) = 0+1 = 1$.\n\nComparing the values of the objective function at the vertices, $\\{0, 0.7, 1, 1\\}$, the minimum value is $0$. This minimum occurs at the vertex $(0,0)$.\n\nGraphically, the level sets of the objective function, $f(x,y) = x+y = k$, are a family of parallel lines with a slope of $-1$. Minimizing $k$ corresponds to shifting this line downwards (towards the origin) as much as possible while still intersecting the feasible polygon. The line with the smallest value of $k$ that touches the feasible region is $x+y=0$, which passes through the vertex $(0,0)$. Any smaller value of $k$ would result in a line that does not intersect the feasible region.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $f(x,y)$ over the given feasible set is $0$.",

This problem asks you to minimize a quadratic function $f(x,y)$, whose level sets are circles, subject to a linear equality constraint. This exercise is designed to build your intuition about constrained optimization by visualizing the solution as the point where the smallest possible level circle just touches, or is tangent to, the feasible line.

Using the graphical viewpoint that the level sets of $f$ are circles centered at the origin and the feasible set is the line $x-2y=1$, explain why the minimizer is the point on the line closest to the origin. Identify the geometric condition that characterizes this closest point in terms of orthogonality between the line and the radius of the circle through the minimizer. Then compute the minimum value of the objective function $f$ over the feasible set. Express your final answer as an exact fraction. Do not compute the coordinates of the minimizer; only compute the minimum value of $f$.",
            "solution": "The problem is to find the minimum of the function $f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$ for points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the constraint $x-2y=1$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the objective function and its relation to the geometric distance from the origin. The distance-squared from a point $(x,y)$ to the origin $(0,0)$ is given by $R^2 = x^2+y^2$. The objective function can be written as $f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}R^2$. Since $R$ must be non-negative, minimizing $f(x,y)$ is equivalent to minimizing $R^2$, which in turn is equivalent to minimizing the distance $R = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ itself. Therefore, the task of minimizing $f(x,y)$ subject to the point $(x,y)$ being on the line $x-2y=1$ is geometrically equivalent to finding the point on this line that is closest to the origin.\n\nNext, we identify the geometric condition that characterizes this closest point. The level sets of the objective function are given by $f(x,y)=c$ for some constant $c \\geq 0$. This is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)=c$, or $x^2+y^2=2c$. These are equations of circles centered at the origin with radius $R=\\sqrt{2c}$. The problem can be visualized as finding the smallest circle centered at the origin that intersects the line $x-2y=1$. As we increase the radius $R$ from $0$, the circle $x^2+y^2=R^2$ expands. The first point of intersection with the line will occur when the circle is exactly tangent to the line. At the point of tangency, the radius of the circle is perpendicular to the tangent line. Since the tangent line in this case is the line $x-2y=1$ itself, the geometric condition is that the line segment connecting the origin to the minimizer point $(x^*, y^*)$, which is the radius vector, must be orthogonal to the line $x-2y=1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimum value of $f$. As established, the minimum value of $f$ corresponds to the point on the line $x-2y=1$ that is closest to the origin. The distance from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to a line given by the equation $Ax+By+C=0$ is $d = \\frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}}$. In our case, the point is the origin $(x_0, y_0) = (0,0)$, and the line can be written as $1x - 2y - 1 = 0$, so $A=1$, $B=-2$, and $C=-1$.\n\nThe minimum distance $R_{min}$ from the origin to the line is:\n$$\nR_{min} = \\frac{|1(0) - 2(0) - 1|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2}} = \\frac{|-1|}{\\sqrt{1+4}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\n$$\nThis minimum distance is the radius of the smallest circle that is tangent to the line. The minimum value of the objective function, $f_{min}$, occurs at this minimum distance. The relationship between the function and the distance is $f = \\frac{1}{2}R^2$. Thus, the minimum value is:\n$$\nf_{min} = \\frac{1}{2}R_{min}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{10}\n$$\nThis computation provides the minimum value of the function without explicitly finding the coordinates of the minimizer, as requested.",

            "solution": "The problem is to find the maximum value of the function $f(x,y)=-x^{2}-y^{2}+a\\,x+b\\,y$ subject to the constraints $-2\\leq x\\leq 3$ and $1\\leq y\\leq 4$. The parameters are given as $a=7$ and $b=1$.\n\nFirst, we substitute the parameters into the objective function:\n$$f(x,y) = -x^{2} - y^{2} + 7x + y$$\n\nThis is a continuous function defined over a closed and bounded (compact) set, the rectangle $R = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid -2 \\le x \\le 3, 1 \\le y \\le 4\\}$. By the Extreme Value Theorem, the function must attain an absolute maximum and minimum on $R$.\n\nThe function $f(x,y)$ is a quadratic function of two variables. To determine its shape, we can analyze its Hessian matrix, $H_f$. The first-order partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -2x + 7$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2y + 1$$\nThe second-order partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = -2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$$\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n$$H_f = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe principal minors are $\\Delta_1 = -2 < 0$ and $\\Delta_2 = (-2)(-2) - (0)(0) = 4 > 0$. Since $\\Delta_1 < 0$ and $\\Delta_2 > 0$, the Hessian is negative definite for all $(x,y)$. This confirms that $f(x,y)$ is a strictly concave function. Its graph is a downward-opening circular paraboloid.\n\nFor a concave function, the critical point where the gradient is zero corresponds to a unique global unconstrained maximum. Let's find this point $(x_0, y_0)$:\n$$\\nabla f(x_0, y_0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2x_0 + 7 \\\\ -2y_0 + 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSolving this system gives $x_0 = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$ and $y_0 = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$. The unconstrained maximum is at the point $(x_0, y_0) = (3.5, 0.5)$.\n\nThe graphical interpretation of this result is that the level sets of $f(x,y)$, defined by $f(x,y)=c$ for some constant $c$, are circles centered at $(x_0, y_0)$. We can see this by completing the square for $f(x,y)$:\n$$f(x,y) = -(x^2 - 7x) - (y^2 - y)$$\n$$f(x,y) = -(x^2 - 7x + (\\frac{7}{2})^2) + (\\frac{7}{2})^2 - (y^2 - y + (\\frac{1}{2})^2) + (\\frac{1}{2})^2$$\n$$f(x,y) = -(x - 3.5)^2 - (y - 0.5)^2 + \\frac{49}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$f(x,y) = \\frac{50}{4} - \\left[ (x - 3.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2 \\right]$$\n$$f(x,y) = 12.5 - \\left[ (x - 3.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2 \\right]$$\nThis form explicitly shows that the value of $f(x,y)$ is determined by the squared Euclidean distance from the center point $(3.5, 0.5)$. The function value is maximized when this distance is minimized.\n\nNow we must consider the constraints. The feasible region is the rectangle $R = [-2, 3] \\times [1, 4]$. The unconstrained maximum at $(3.5, 0.5)$ lies outside this region, since $x_0 = 3.5 > 3$ and $y_0 = 0.5 < 1$.\n\nSince the function value decreases as we move away from the center $(3.5, 0.5)$, the maximum value of $f(x,y)$ over the feasible rectangle $R$ must occur at the point $(x^*, y^*)$ in $R$ that is closest to $(3.5, 0.5)$. This is a projection problem: we need to find the projection of the point $P_0=(3.5, 0.5)$ onto the set $R$.\n\nFor a rectangular region, this projection can be found by considering each coordinate independently.\n1. For the $x$-coordinate, we project $x_0=3.5$ onto the interval $[-2, 3]$. Since $3.5$ is greater than the upper bound $3$, the closest point in the interval is $x^* = 3$.\n2. For the $y$-coordinate, we project $y_0=0.5$ onto the interval $[1, 4]$. Since $0.5$ is less than the lower bound $1$, the closest point in the interval is $y^* = 1$.\n\nThus, the point in the feasible region that maximizes the function is $(x^*, y^*) = (3, 1)$. This point is one of the corners of the rectangular domain.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the function at this point to find the maximum value:\n$$f(3, 1) = -(3)^2 - (1)^2 + 7(3) + 1$$\n$$f(3, 1) = -9 - 1 + 21 + 1$$\n$$f(3, 1) = -10 + 22$$\n$$f(3, 1) = 12$$\n\nAlternatively, using the completed square form:\n$$f(3, 1) = 12.5 - \\left[ (3 - 3.5)^2 + (1 - 0.5)^2 \\right]$$\n$$f(3, 1) = 12.5 - \\left[ (-0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 \\right]$$\n$$f(3, 1) = 12.5 - [0.25 + 0.25]$$\n$$f(3, 1) = 12.5 - 0.5$$\n$$f(3, 1) = 12$$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The maximum value of $f(x,y)$ on the given rectangle is $12$.",
