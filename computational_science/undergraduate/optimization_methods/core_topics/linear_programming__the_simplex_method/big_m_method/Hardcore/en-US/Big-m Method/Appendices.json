            "problem": "A single real-valued decision variable $x$ is bounded as $x \\in [0,100]$. You wish to enforce the logical disjunction $x \\leq 30$ or $x \\geq 70$ using a binary decision variable $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ within the framework of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Starting from the fundamental definition that the large-constant (big-$M$) method uses upper and lower bounding constants to deactivate linear constraints depending on the value of a binary variable, derive a linear inequality system that models the disjunction via the big-$M$ method. Using only the given bounds on $x$ and the thresholds $30$ and $70$, determine the smallest valid constant $M$ that makes the formulation correct for all feasible values of $x$ and $y$. Then, analyze the continuous relaxation in which $y \\in [0,1]$ and prove that with this minimal $M$, the relaxed feasible region in the extended space $(x,y)$ is exactly the convex hull of the original disjunctive region.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for a logical disjunction using the big-$M$ method, the determination of the minimal valid constant $M$, and an analysis of the continuous relaxation.\n\n### Step 1: Formulating the Disjunction with the Big-M Method\n\nThe logical disjunction to be modeled is $x \\leq 30$ or $x \\geq 70$. The decision variable $x$ is a real number bounded by $x \\in [0, 100]$. A binary variable $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is introduced to control the disjunction.\n\nLet us define the relationship between the binary variable $y$ and the two conditions:\n- If $y=1$, the constraint $x \\leq 30$ must be active.\n- If $y=0$, the constraint $x \\geq 70$ must be active.\n\nTo use the big-$M$ method, we first rewrite the inequalities in the standard form $f(x) \\leq 0$:\n1. $x - 30 \\leq 0$\n2. $70 - x \\leq 0$\n\nThe general big-$M$ formulation for a disjunction of two inequalities, $f_1(x) \\leq 0$ or $f_2(x) \\leq 0$, using a binary variable $y$ is:\n$$f_1(x) \\leq M(1-y)$$\n$$f_2(x) \\leq M y$$\nHere, we associate $y=1$ with the first inequality being active ($f_1(x) \\leq 0$) and $y=0$ with the second being active ($f_2(x) \\leq 0$).\n\nApplying this to our specific problem, we have $f_1(x) = x-30$ and $f_2(x) = 70-x$. The system of inequalities becomes:\n$$x - 30 \\leq M(1-y) \\quad (1)$$\n$$70 - x \\leq M y \\quad (2)$$\n\nLet's verify this formulation:\n- If $y=1$: Inequality (1) becomes $x - 30 \\leq M(0) \\implies x \\leq 30$. Inequality (2) becomes $70 - x \\leq M(1) \\implies 70 - x \\leq M$. The second inequality must be redundant for any feasible $x$ under the condition $x \\leq 30$.\n- If $y=0$: Inequality (1) becomes $x - 30 \\leq M(1) \\implies x-30 \\leq M$. This inequality must be redundant for any feasible $x$ under the condition $x \\geq 70$. Inequality (2) becomes $70 - x \\leq M(0) \\implies 70 - x \\leq 0 \\implies x \\geq 70$.\n\nThe formulation correctly models the disjunction, provided the constant $M$ is chosen to be sufficiently large.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Minimal Valid Constant $M$\n\nThe constant $M$ must be large enough to make the \"inactive\" constraint non-restrictive over the feasible domain of $x$. The overall domain for $x$ is given as $[0, 100]$.\n\n1.  Consider the case when $y=0$, which enforces $x \\geq 70$. The other constraint is $x - 30 \\leq M$. This must hold for all values of $x$ that are possible in this case. The possible range for $x$ is thus $[70, 100]$. To ensure $x-30 \\leq M$ is always satisfied, $M$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum possible value of the left-hand side, $x-30$, over this range.\n    $$M \\geq \\max_{x \\in [70, 100]} (x-30)$$\n    The expression $x-30$ is maximized when $x$ is maximized, i.e., at $x=100$.\n    $$M \\geq 100 - 30 = 70$$\n\n2.  Consider the case when $y=1$, which enforces $x \\leq 30$. The other constraint is $70 - x \\leq M$. This must hold for all values of $x$ that are possible in this case. The possible range for $x$ is thus $[0, 30]$. To ensure $70-x \\leq M$ is always satisfied, $M$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum possible value of the left-hand side, $70-x$, over this range.\n    $$M \\geq \\max_{x \\in [0, 30]} (70-x)$$\n    The expression $70-x$ is maximized when $x$ is minimized, i.e., at $x=0$.\n    $$M \\geq 70 - 0 = 70$$\n\nBoth conditions require $M \\geq 70$. Therefore, the smallest valid value for the constant $M$ is $70$.\n\nThe final inequality system using the minimal $M$ is:\n$$x - 30 \\leq 70(1-y)$$\n$$70 - x \\leq 70y$$\n$$x \\in [0, 100], \\quad y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Continuous Relaxation\n\nThe problem asks to prove that the continuous relaxation of this formulation, with the minimal $M=70$, yields the convex hull of the disjunctive feasible region.\n\nThe feasible set for the MILP in the $(x,y)$-space is the union of two disjoint sets (line segments):\n- For $y=0$: $x \\in [70, 100]$. This gives the set $S_0 = \\{(x,0) \\mid x \\in [70, 100]\\}$.\n- For $y=1$: $x \\in [0, 30]$. This gives the set $S_1 = \\{(x,1) \\mid x \\in [0, 30]\\}$.\nThe total feasible set is $S_{MILP} = S_0 \\cup S_1$. This set consists of two line segments in the plane, whose endpoints are $(70,0)$, $(100,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(30,1)$.\n\nThe convex hull of $S_{MILP}$, denoted $\\text{conv}(S_{MILP})$, is the smallest convex set containing $S_{MILP}$. Since $S_{MILP}$ is composed of two line segments, its convex hull is the polygon formed by their four endpoints: $(70,0)$, $(100,0)$, $(30,1)$, and $(0,1)$.\n\nThe continuous relaxation of the MILP formulation is obtained by allowing $y$ to take any real value in $[0,1]$. The region of the continuous relaxation, let's call it $P$, is defined by the following inequalities:\n1. $x \\in [0, 100]$\n2. $y \\in [0, 1]$\n3. $x - 30 \\leq 70(1-y) \\implies x + 70y \\leq 100$\n4. $70 - x \\leq 70y \\implies x + 70y \\geq 70$\n\nThe set $P$ is a polyhedron. To prove that $P = \\text{conv}(S_{MILP})$, we can show that the vertices of the polyhedron $P$ are precisely the endpoints of the segments in $S_{MILP}$. Let's find the vertices of $P$ by intersecting its boundary inequalities.\n\n- Intersection of $y=0$ and $x+70y=70$: $x=70$. Point: $(70,0)$.\n- Intersection of $y=0$ and $x=100$: Point: $(100,0)$. (This also satisfies $x+70y = 100 \\leq 100$ and $100 \\geq 70$).\n- Intersection of $y=1$ and $x+70y=100$: $x+70=100 \\implies x=30$. Point: $(30,1)$.\n- Intersection of $y=1$ and $x=0$: Point: $(0,1)$. (This also satisfies $x+70y = 70 \\geq 70$ and $70 \\leq 100$).\n- Intersection of $x=0$ and $x+70y=70$: $70y=70 \\implies y=1$. Point: $(0,1)$.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region $P$ of the continuous relaxation are $(70,0)$, $(100,0)$, $(30,1)$, and $(0,1)$. These are exactly the four extreme points that define $\\text{conv}(S_{MILP})$. Since $P$ is a convex polygon whose vertices are the extreme points of $\\text{conv}(S_{MILP})$, the two sets are identical. Thus, $P = \\text{conv}(S_{MILP})$.\n\nThis proves that using the minimal value $M=70$ results in a \"tight\" formulation, where the linear programming relaxation defines the convex hull of the integer solutions.\n\nThe question asks for the minimal value of $M$. Based on the derivation, this value is $70$.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\nFirst, we convert the LP to standard form by introducing a surplus variable $s_2$, a slack variable $s_3$, and two artificial variables $a_1$ and $a_2$.\nMaximize $z = 5x_1 + 3x_2$\nsubject to:\n$2x_1 + x_2 + a_1 = 4$\n$-x_1 + 2x_2 - s_2 + a_2 = 3$\n$x_1 + x_2 + s_3 = 5$\n$x_1, x_2, s_2, s_3, a_1, a_2 \\ge 0$\n\nThe initial basic variables are $a_1, a_2, s_3$. The initial Basic Feasible Solution (for the auxiliary problem) is $(x_1, x_2, s_2, s_3, a_1, a_2) = (0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 3)$.\n\n**Big-M (BM) Method**\nThe objective function is modified to penalize the artificial variables: Maximize $Z = 5x_1 + 3x_2 - M a_1 - M a_2$. The initial $z$-row of the simplex tableau is $Z - 5x_1 - 3x_2 + M a_1 + M a_2 = 0$. To make the tableau canonical, we substitute $a_1$ and $a_2$ out of the $z$-row using the constraints:\n$a_1 = 4 - 2x_1 - x_2$\n$a_2 = 3 + x_1 - 2x_2 + s_2$\nThis results in the initial $z$-row: $Z + (-M-5)x_1 + (-3M-3)x_2 + Ms_2 = -7M$.\nThe initial tableau has basic variables $\\{a_1, a_2, s_3\\}$ and RHS values $\\{4, 3, 5\\}$. The coefficients of the non-basic variables in the $z$-row (i.e., the reduced costs $z_j-c_j$) are $(-M-5)$ for $x_1$, $(-3M-3)$ for $x_2$, and $M$ for $s_2$.\n\n**BM Pivot 1:**\n- The most negative coefficient in the $z$-row is $-3M-3$ (since $M$ is large and positive). Thus, $x_2$ is the entering variable.\n- The minimum ratio test is performed: $\\min\\{4/1, 3/2, 5/1\\} = 1.5$. The minimum ratio corresponds to the row with basic variable $a_2$.\n- $x_2$ enters the basis and $a_2$ leaves the basis. This is the first pivot. The objective value changes from $Z=-7M$ to $Z = -5M/2 + 9/2$. No degeneracy occurs as the minimum ratio is positive.\n\n**BM Pivot 2:**\n- After the first pivot, the new basis is $\\{a_1, x_2, s_3\\}$. The BFS is $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 1.5)$, which is not feasible for the original problem as $a_1=2.5 \\neq 0$.\n- The new $z$-row coefficients for non-basic variables $x_1$ and $s_2$ are $-5M/2 - 13/2$ and $-M/2 - 3/2$, respectively.

No degeneracy occurs.\n\n**BM Pivot 3:**\n- After the second pivot, the basis is $\\{x_1, x_2, s_3\\}$. The BFS is $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 2)$. All artificial variables are non-basic, so this solution is feasible for the original problem, with $z = 5(1)+3(2) = 11$.\n- The new $z$-row coefficient for the non-basic variable $s_2$ is $-1/5$.

No degenerate pivots occurred.\n\n**Two-Phase Simplex (TPS) Method**\n\n**Phase I:**\nThe objective is to minimize $w = a_1 + a_2$, which is equivalent to maximizing $-w = -a_1 - a_2$.\nThe initial $z$-row for Phase I is $-w + a_1 + a_2 = 0$. After making it canonical, the $z$-row is $-w - x_1 - 3x_2 + s_2 = -7$.\nThe initial tableau is identical to the Big-M tableau if we set $M=1$ in the $z$-row coefficients of $x_1$ and $x_2$ and $M=0$ for $s_2$ and the RHS.\n\n**TPS Phase I, Pivot 1:**\n- The most negative coefficient in the $-w$ row is $-3$ for $x_2$. $x_2$ enters.\n- The minimum ratio test is $\\min\\{4/1, 3/2, 5/1\\} = 1.5$. $a_2$ leaves.\n- This pivot is identical to the first pivot of the Big-M method. The objective $-w$ changes from $-7$ to $-5/2$. No degeneracy.\n\n**TPS Phase I, Pivot 2:**\n- The new basis is $\\{a_1, x_2, s_3\\}$. The $-w$ row coefficient for $x_1$ is $-5/2$ and for $s_2$ is $-1/2$. The most negative is for $x_1$.\n- $x_1$ enters. The minimum ratio test is $\\min\\{(5/2)/(5/2), (7/2)/(3/2)\\} = 1$. $a_1$ leaves.\n- This pivot is identical to the second pivot of the Big-M method. The objective $-w$ becomes $0$.\n\nPhase I terminates after $2$ pivots. The optimal value is $w=0$, indicating a feasible solution for the original problem has been found. The basis is $\\{x_1, x_2, s_3\\}$. No degenerate pivots occurred in Phase I.\n\n**Phase II:**\nWe remove the artificial variable columns and the Phase I objective row. The initial tableau for Phase II is the final tableau of Phase I. The objective function is the original one: $z = 5x_1 + 3x_2$. The $z$-row is $z - 5x_1 - 3x_2 = 0$.\nThe basis is $\\{x_1, x_2, s_3\\}$. We make the $z$-row canonical by substituting out $x_1$ and $x_2$. This yields the $z$-row $z - (1/5)s_2 = 11$. This is identical to the state of the Big-M method after its second pivot (ignoring the large $M$ terms).\n\n**TPS Phase II, Pivot 1:**\n- The $z$-row has a negative coefficient $-1/5$ for $s_2$. The solution is not optimal.\n- $s_2$ enters. The minimum ratio test is $\\min\\{1/(1/5), 2/(1/5)\\} = 5$. $x_1$ leaves.\n- This pivot is identical to the third pivot of the Big-M method. The objective value becomes $z=12$. No degeneracy.\n\nAfter this pivot, all coefficients in the $z$-row are non-negative. The algorithm terminates.\nThe total number of pivots for the Two-Phase method is $2$ (Phase I) + $1$ (Phase II) = $3$. No degenerate pivots occurred.\n\n**Comparison and Final Answer**\n- Total pivots for Big-M method: $3$.\n- Total pivots for Two-Phase Simplex method: $3$.\n- No degenerate pivots were observed in either method.\n- The optimal objective value obtained is $z=12$.\n\nThe difference in the total number of pivot iterations is:\n$(\\text{total BM pivots}) - (\\text{total TPS pivots}) = 3 - 3 = 0$.",

            "solution": "To determine the correct conclusion from the final simplex tableau provided, we must analyze three key aspects: optimality, feasibility, and degeneracy.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Optimality**\nThe problem states that for a maximization problem using the $c_j - z_j$ row, the tableau is optimal if all entries in this row are less than or equal to zero. Let's examine the $c_j - z_j$ row for the non-basic variables ($x_2$, $s_1$, $s_2$):\n- For $x_2$, the value is $-2$.\n- For $s_1$, the value is $-5 - 2M$. Since $M$ is a large positive number, this value is strongly negative.\n- For $s_2$, the value is $-M$, which is also a large negative number.\n\nAll entries in the $c_j-z_j$ row are less than or equal to zero. This satisfies the optimality condition. Therefore, the tableau represents an optimal solution for the problem formulated using the Big M method. This means that option D, which claims the tableau is not optimal, is incorrect. Since an optimal solution has been found, the solution cannot be unbounded, which eliminates option B.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Feasibility of the Original Problem**\nThe Big M method uses artificial variables to find an initial basic feasible solution. The interpretation of these variables in the final tableau determines the feasibility of the *original* LP problem.\nThe rules are as follows:\n1.  If all artificial variables are non-basic (i.e., their value is 0), then the original problem is feasible, and the solution found is an optimal feasible solution.\n2.  If any artificial variable remains in the basis with a *positive* value in the \"Solution\" column, then the original problem is infeasible.\n3.  If an artificial variable remains in the basis but its value is *zero*, the original problem is feasible.\n\nLooking at the final tableau, the artificial variable $a_1$ is listed in the \"Basis\" column. However, its value in the \"Solution\" column is 0. According to the third rule, this means that the original linear programming problem is feasible. Therefore, option A, which claims the problem is infeasible, is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Check for Degeneracy**\nA basic feasible solution in a linear program is defined as degenerate if at least one of the basic variables has a value of zero. The basic variables are those listed in the \"Basis\" column.\nFrom the tableau, the basic variables are $x_1$ and $a_1$. Their corresponding values from the \"Solution\" column are:\n- $x_1 = 4$\n- $a_1 = 0$\n\nSince one of the basic variables, $a_1$, has a value of zero, the solution is degenerate. The existence of an artificial variable in the optimal basis with a value of zero is a classic indicator of a redundant constraint in the original problem formulation. In this case, the constraints $x_1 + x_2 \\le 4$ and $2x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 8$ (which simplifies to $x_1 + x_2 \\ge 4$) together imply that any feasible solution must satisfy $x_1 + x_2 = 4$. One of the inequalities is redundant, leading to this degenerate case.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n- The tableau is optimal.\n- The original problem is feasible.\n- The optimal solution is degenerate.\n\nCombining these findings, we conclude that the original problem is feasible and has an optimal solution, but the solution is degenerate. This matches option C. Option E is incorrect because the solution is degenerate.",
