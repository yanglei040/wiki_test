            "solution": "The minimum-cost flow problem on a directed network specifies flows $x_{ij}$ on each arc $(i,j)$ subject to capacity constraints and node balance (flow conservation) equations. For each node $v$, the conservation law states that the net outflow equals the node balance:\n$$\n\\sum_{j:(v,j)\\in A} x_{vj} \\;-\\; \\sum_{i:(i,v)\\in A} x_{iv} \\;=\\; b_{v},\n$$\nwhere $A$ denotes the set of arcs.

This constant does not affect the optimal $y_{ij}$ solution, but it does shift the optimal objective value of the original problem relative to the transformed one.\n\nWe now compute all elements for the given network. First, compute the transformed upper bounds $u'_{ij}$ for completeness:\n$$\nu'_{12} = 7 - 2 = 5,\\quad u'_{13} = 5 - 1 = 4,\\quad u'_{14} = 3 - 0 = 3,\n$$\n$$\nu'_{23} = 4 - 1 = 3,\\quad u'_{24} = 6 - 2 = 4,\\quad u'_{34} = 9 - 3 = 6.\n$$\nNext, compute $b'_{v}$ by evaluating $\\sum_{j} l_{vj}$ (outgoing lower bounds from $v$) and $\\sum_{i} l_{iv}$ (incoming lower bounds to $v$) for each node:\n\nFor node $1$:\nOutgoing lower bounds: $l_{12}=2$, $l_{13}=1$, $l_{14}=0$ give $\\sum_{j} l_{1j} = 2+1+0 = 3$.\nIncoming lower bounds: none, so $\\sum_{i} l_{i1} = 0$.\nThus,\n$$\nb'_{1} \\;=\\; 6 \\;-\\; 3 \\;+\\; 0 \\;=\\; 3.\n$$\n\nFor node $2$:\nOutgoing lower bounds: $l_{23}=1$, $l_{24}=2$ give $\\sum_{j} l_{2j} = 3$.\nIncoming lower bounds: $l_{12}=2$ so $\\sum_{i} l_{i2} = 2$.\nThus,\n$$\nb'_{2} \\;=\\; (-2) \\;-\\; 3 \\;+\\; 2 \\;=\\; -3.\n$$\n\nFor node $3$:\nOutgoing lower bounds: $l_{34}=3$ gives $\\sum_{j} l_{3j} = 3$.\nIncoming lower bounds: $l_{13}=1$, $l_{23}=1$ give $\\sum_{i} l_{i3} = 2$.\nThus,\n$$\nb'_{3} \\;=\\; (-1) \\;-\\; 3 \\;+\\; 2 \\;=\\; -2.\n$$\n\nFor node $4$:\nOutgoing lower bounds: none, so $\\sum_{j} l_{4j} = 0$.\nIncoming lower bounds: $l_{14}=0$, $l_{24}=2$, $l_{34}=3$ give $\\sum_{i} l_{i4} = 5$.\nThus,\n$$\nb'_{4} \\;=\\; (-3) \\;-\\; 0 \\;+\\; 5 \\;=\\; 2.\n$$\nCheck that $\\sum_{v} b'_{v} = 3 + (-3) + (-2) + 2 = 0$, ensuring transformed feasibility is consistent with conservation.\n\nNow compute the constant $K$ added to the objective:\n$$\nK \\;=\\; c_{12} l_{12} + c_{13} l_{13} + c_{14} l_{14} + c_{23} l_{23} + c_{24} l_{24} + c_{34} l_{34}.\n$$\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$\nK \\;=\\; (3)(2) \\;+\\; (2)(1) \\;+\\; (5)(0) \\;+\\; (1)(1) \\;+\\; (3)(2) \\;+\\; (4)(3).\n$$\nEvaluate term by term:\n$$\n(3)(2)=6,\\quad (2)(1)=2,\\quad (5)(0)=0,\\quad (1)(1)=1,\\quad (3)(2)=6,\\quad (4)(3)=12.\n$$\nSumming yields\n$$\nK \\;=\\; 6 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 6 + 12 \\;=\\; 27.\n$$\n\nFinally, to explain how the network simplex basis reflects the transformed problem: The network simplex method maintains a basis that corresponds to a spanning tree $T$ of the network in the zero-lower-bound formulation. Feasible basic solutions assign flows $y_{ij}$ on tree arcs so that the node balance equations with $b'_{v}$ are satisfied, while non-tree arcs are at one of their bounds (either $y_{ij}=0$ or $y_{ij}=u'_{ij}$). In terms of the original variables $x_{ij}$, arcs with $y_{ij}=0$ correspond to $x_{ij}=l_{ij}$, meaning these arcs sit at their lower bounds; arcs with $y_{ij}=u'_{ij}$ correspond to $x_{ij}=u_{ij}$, sitting at their upper bounds; and tree arcs carry interior flows $x_{ij}=l_{ij}+y_{ij}$ adjusted to satisfy the transformed balances. Thus, the spanning tree structure in the transformed network directly encodes the basis for the original lower-bound problem, with the fixed lower-bound flows incorporated into $b'_{v}$ and the variable part $y_{ij}$ handled by the tree.\n\nThe requested scalar constant added to the objective after transformation is $K=27$.",

The node supplies/demands (denoted $b_v$) are assigned at the four corners as follows: $b_A = 3$, $b_B = -2$, $b_C = 3$, and $b_D = -4$, where a positive value denotes supply and a negative value denotes demand.

            "solution": "We formulate the Minimum-Cost Flow (MCF) problem on the directed network with node balances and nonnegativity constraints.

The objective is to minimize the total cost\n$$\n\\sum_{(i,j)} c_{i j} x_{i j}.\n$$\n\nStep 1: Solve for the basic feasible flow associated with the initial tree $T = \\{A \\to B, A \\to C, C \\to D\\}$ and the nonbasic arc $B \\to D$ fixed at zero. Let the basic flows be $x_{A B}$, $x_{A C}$, and $x_{C D}$, and the nonbasic flow be $x_{B D} = 0$. Write the node-balance equations using the standard convention $\\sum_{\\text{out}} x - \\sum_{\\text{in}} x = b$:\n- At $A$: $x_{A B} + x_{A C} = b_A = 3$.\n- At $B$: $x_{B D} - x_{A B} = b_B = -2$. Since $x_{B D} = 0$, this gives $-x_{A B} = -2$, hence $x_{A B} = 2$.\n- At $C$: $x_{C D} - x_{A C} = b_C = 3$, so $x_{C D} - x_{A C} = 3$.\n- At $D$: $0 - (x_{B D} + x_{C D}) = b_D = -4$. With $x_{B D} = 0$, this gives $-x_{C D} = -4$, hence $x_{C D} = 4$.\n\nFrom $x_{C D} - x_{A C} = 3$ and $x_{C D} = 4$, we get $x_{A C} = 1$. The $A$-balance $x_{A B} + x_{A C} = 3$ is satisfied since $2 + 1 = 3$.

The reduced cost for an arc $(i,j)$ is $\\bar{c}_{ij} = c_{ij} - \\pi_i + \\pi_j$. For the basic arcs we require $\\bar{c}_{ij} = 0$, which implies $\\pi_i - \\pi_j = c_{ij}$.

For this pivot, we have:\n- Forward arcs: $B \\to D$ (entering), $A \\to B$\n- Backward arcs: $A \\to C$, $C \\to D$\n\nTo maintain nonnegativity, $\\theta$ is limited by the minimum flow on the backward arcs. The current flows on the backward arcs are $x_{C D} = 4$ and $x_{A C} = 1$, so $\\theta = \\min\\{4, 1\\} = 1$.\n\nUpdate flows by $\\theta = 1$ along the cycle:\n- $x_{B D} \\leftarrow 0 + 1 = 1$,\n- $x_{A B} \\leftarrow 2 + 1 = 3$,\n- $x_{A C} \\leftarrow 1 - 1 = 0$,\n- $x_{C D} \\leftarrow 4 - 1 = 3$.\n\nThe leaving arc is $A \\to C$ (it reached zero), so the new basis is $\\{A \\to B, B \\to D, C \\to D\\}$ with the nonbasic arc $A \\to C$ at zero flow.\n\nStep 3: Compute the new total cost and check for further improvement.

Arcs have lower bounds $0$, finite upper bounds $U_{ij}$, and costs $c_{ij}$. The objective is to minimize the total cost $\\sum_{(i,j)\\in A} c_{ij} x_{ij}$ subject to flow conservation at each node and capacity bounds on each arc.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the cost decrease resulting from a single pivot of the Network Simplex Method on a given minimum-cost flow problem. The process is broken down into several steps as prescribed by the method's logic.\n\nFirst, we calculate the node potentials, denoted by $\\pi_i$ for each node $i \\in N$. The potentials are determined by the condition that for every basic arc $(i,j)$ in the basic spanning tree $B$, the reduced cost $\\bar{c}_{ij} = c_{ij} - \\pi_i + \\pi_j$ must be zero. This implies $\\pi_i - \\pi_j = c_{ij}$. The given basic spanning tree is $B=\\{(1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5)\\}$. This gives us a system of $|N|-1 = 4$ linear equations in $|N|=5$ variables. We can set one potential arbitrarily. Let us set $\\pi_1 = 0$.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n1. For basic arc $(1,2)$: $\\pi_1 - \\pi_2 = c_{12}$. With $c_{12}=4$ and $\\pi_1=0$, we have $0 - \\pi_2 = 4$, which yields $\\pi_2 = -4$.\n2. For basic arc $(2,3)$: $\\pi_2 - \\pi_3 = c_{23}$. With $c_{23}=1$ and $\\pi_2=-4$, we have $-4 - \\pi_3 = 1$, which yields $\\pi_3 = -5$.\n3. For basic arc $(2,4)$: $\\pi_2 - \\pi_4 = c_{24}$. With $c_{24}=2$ and $\\pi_2=-4$, we have $-4 - \\pi_4 = 2$, which yields $\\pi_4 = -6$.\n4. For basic arc $(3,5)$: $\\pi_3 - \\pi_5 = c_{35}$. With $c_{35}=3$ and $\\pi_3=-5$, we have $-5 - \\pi_5 = 3$, which yields $\\pi_5 = -8$.\n\nThe calculated node potentials are $\\pi_1=0$, $\\pi_2=-4$, $\\pi_3=-5$, $\\pi_4=-6$, and $\\pi_5=-8$.\n\nNext, we calculate the reduced cost of the nonbasic arc $(1,3)$, which is the candidate to enter the basis. The reduced cost $\\bar{c}_{13}$ is given by the formula $\\bar{c}_{13} = c_{13} - \\pi_1 + \\pi_3$. Using the given cost $c_{13}=-1$ and our calculated potentials $\\pi_1=0$ and $\\pi_3=-5$, we find:\n$$\n\\bar{c}_{13} = -1 - 0 + (-5) = -6\n$$\nSince $\\bar{c}_{13}  0$, introducing arc $(1,3)$ into the basis and increasing its flow will decrease the total cost. The problem specifies that this is the pivot to be performed.\n\nThe third step is to identify the fundamental cycle created by adding the entering arc $(1,3)$ to the basic spanning tree $B$. The cycle consists of the entering arc $(1,3)$ and the unique path between nodes $1$ and $3$ in the tree $B$. The path in $B$ from node $1$ to node $3$ is $1-2-3$, consisting of arcs $(1,2)$ and $(2,3)$. Therefore, the cycle is $1 \\to 3 \\to 2 \\to 1$.\n\nWe now augment the flow by an amount $\\theta > 0$ around this cycle. Pushing flow $\\theta$ along the entering arc $(1,3)$ means its flow increases. This is a forward arc in the cycle. To maintain flow conservation, this flow must be routed back from node $3$ to node $1$ along the tree path $3 \\to 2 \\to 1$. This involves traversing arcs $(2,3)$ and $(1,2)$ in the reverse direction of their orientation in the network.\n- The flow on the forward arc $(1,3)$ increases: $x'_{13} = x_{13} + \\theta = 0 + \\theta$.\n- The flow on the backward arc $(2,3)$ decreases: $x'_{23} = x_{23} - \\theta = 5 - \\theta$.\n- The flow on the backward arc $(1,2)$ decreases: $x'_{12} = x_{12} - \\theta = 8 - \\theta$.\n\nThe value of the augmentation $\\theta$ is the maximum possible value that preserves the flow feasibility, i.e., $0 \\le x'_{ij} \\le U_{ij}$ for all arcs in the cycle.\n- For the forward arc $(1,3)$: $x'_{13} \\le U_{13} \\implies 0 + \\theta \\le 10 \\implies \\theta \\le 10$. This is the residual capacity of the forward arc.\n- For the backward arc $(2,3)$: $x'_{23} \\ge 0 \\implies 5 - \\theta \\ge 0 \\implies \\theta \\le 5$. This is the current flow on the backward arc.\n- For the backward arc $(1,2)$: $x'_{12} \\ge 0 \\implies 8 - \\theta \\ge 0 \\implies \\theta \\le 8$. This is the current flow on the backward arc.\n\nCombining these constraints, the maximum possible value for $\\theta$ is the minimum of these upper bounds:\n$$\n\\theta = \\min(10, 5, 8) = 5\n$$\nThe leaving arc is the one whose constraint is active, which is arc $(2,3)$ as its flow becomes $5 - 5 = 0$.\n\nFinally, the total change in the objective cost, $\\Delta Z$, is the product of the reduced cost of the entering arc and the amount of flow augmentation $\\theta$.\n$$\n\\Delta Z = \\bar{c}_{13} \\times \\theta\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\n\\Delta Z = (-6) \\times 5 = -30\n$$\nThe total cost decreases by $30$. The problem asks for the magnitude of this decrease, which is $|\\Delta Z|$.\n$$\n|\\Delta Z| = |-30| = 30\n$$",
