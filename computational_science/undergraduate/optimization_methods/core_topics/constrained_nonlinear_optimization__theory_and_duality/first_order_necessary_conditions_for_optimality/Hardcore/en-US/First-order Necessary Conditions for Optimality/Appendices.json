To determine a single best estimate, $c$, for the constant based on these measurements, the physicist decides to use the principle of least squares. This principle states that the best estimate is the value of $c$ that minimizes the sum of the squared deviations between the estimate and each measurement.\n\nThe sum of squared deviations is given by the function:\n$$ S(c) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - c)^2 $$\n\nUsing the first-order necessary condition for a minimum, determine the value of $c$ that minimizes $S(c)$.

We can substitute the equality constraint $x_2 = 2 - x_1$ into the objective function to obtain a one-dimensional problem in $x_1$. The feasible range for $x_1$ is determined by $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_2 = 2 - x_1 \\ge 0$, which implies $x_1 \\in [0, 2]$. The constraint $x_1 \\le 2$ is already incorporated.\nThe new objective function is $F(x_1) = f(x_1, 2-x_1)$:\n$$ F(x_1) = (x_1 - 3)^2 + ((2-x_1) + 1)^2 + 2(x_1 - (2-x_1)) $$\n$$ F(x_1) = (x_1 - 3)^2 + (3 - x_1)^2 + 2(2x_1 - 2) $$\n$$ F(x_1) = 2(x_1 - 3)^2 + 4(x_1 - 1) = 2(x_1^2 - 6x_1 + 9) + 4x_1 - 4 = 2x_1^2 - 8x_1 + 14 $$\nTo find the minimum of $F(x_1)$ over $[0, 2]$, we compute its derivative:\n$$ F'(x_1) = 4x_1 - 8 $$\nSetting $F'(x_1) = 0$ gives $x_1 = 2$. This point is the vertex of the upward-opening parabola $F(x_1)$, and it lies at the boundary of the feasible interval $[0, 2]$. Therefore, the minimum value of $F(x_1)$ on this interval occurs at $x_1^*=2$.\nThe corresponding value for $x_2$ is $x_2^* = 2 - x_1^* = 2 - 2 = 0$.\nThe KKT point and thus the optimal solution is $\\mathbf{x}^* = (2, 0)$.\n\nNext, we determine the active set and the multipliers. At $\\mathbf{x}^* = (2, 0)$:\n- $h(\\mathbf{x}^*) = 2 + 0 - 2 = 0$ (Active).\n- $g_1(\\mathbf{x}^*) = -x_1^* = -2  0$ (Inactive).\n- $g_2(\\mathbf{x}^*) = -x_2^* = -0 = 0$ (Active).\n- $g_3(\\mathbf{x}^*) = x_1^* - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$ (Active).\nThe active set of constraints is $\\{h, g_2, g_3\\}$.\n\nFrom the complementary slackness conditions:\n- Since $g_1$ is inactive, its multiplier must be zero: $\\mu_1 = 0$.\n- For $g_2$ and $g_3$, which are active, the condition is satisfied, and the multipliers $\\mu_2$ and $\\mu_3$ are not necessarily zero. From dual feasibility, $\\mu_2 \\ge 0$ and $\\mu_3 \\ge 0$.\n\nNow we substitute $\\mathbf{x}^* = (2, 0)$ and $\\mu_1 = 0$ into the stationarity equations:\n1.  $2(2) - 4 + \\lambda - 0 + \\mu_3 = 0 \\implies \\lambda + \\mu_3 = 0$.\n2.  $2(0) + \\lambda - \\mu_2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda - \\mu_2 = 0$.\n\nFrom the second equation, $\\lambda = \\mu_2$. Since $\\mu_2 \\ge 0$ (dual feasibility), we must have $\\lambda \\ge 0$.\nFrom the first equation, $\\mu_3 = -\\lambda$. Since $\\mu_3 \\ge 0$ (dual feasibility), we must have $-\\lambda \\ge 0$, which implies $\\lambda \\le 0$.\n\nTo satisfy both $\\lambda \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda \\le 0$, the only possibility is $\\lambda = 0$.\nConsequently, this gives $\\mu_2 = \\lambda = 0$ and $\\mu_3 = -\\lambda = 0$.\nThe full set of multipliers is $(\\lambda, \\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3) = (0, 0, 0, 0)$.\nThis is a degenerate case where active inequality constraints have zero multipliers. This occurs because the unconstrained minimum of the objective function on the line $x_1+x_2=2$ happens to coincide with a vertex of the feasible region.\n\nAnswering the specific questions:\n- The KKT conditions have been written out above.\n- The active set at the KKT point $\\mathbf{x}^*=(2,0)$ consists of $\\{h, g_2, g_3\\}$. The multiplier $\\mu_1$ must be zero as $g_1$ is inactive. The multipliers $\\mu_2$ and $\\mu_3$ correspond to active constraints, but they are also zero in this solution; this demonstrates that an active constraint can have a zero multiplier. No inequality multiplier is strictly positive.\n- The value of the Lagrange multiplier associated with the equality constraint at the KKT point is $\\lambda = 0$.",

The rate of this decrease is given by the sum of the Lagrange multipliers.\nNumerically:\n$$ \\frac{dw^\\star}{d\\sigma_{\\max}} \\approx -(1.848 \\times 10^{-7} + 4.929 \\times 10^{-7}) \\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = -6.777 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, this is $-6.78 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Options\n- **Option A:** Correctly states that both constraints are active, provides the correct formulas for $A_i^\\star$ and $\\lambda_i^\\star$, correctly calculates their numerical values, and provides the correct formula and value for the shadow price. The units N/Pa used in the option are dimensionally equivalent to the derived units of $\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n- **Option B:** Incorrectly states the multipliers are negative and that the weight increases with $\\sigma_{\\max}$.\n- **Option C:** Incorrectly claims only one constraint is active. Both are active because both areas are independently minimized.\n- **Option D:** Incorrectly equates multipliers with areas and provides incorrect formulas and values.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option A is correct.",
