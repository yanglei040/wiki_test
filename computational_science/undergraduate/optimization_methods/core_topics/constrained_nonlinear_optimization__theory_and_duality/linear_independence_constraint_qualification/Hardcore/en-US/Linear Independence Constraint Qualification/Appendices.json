            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the Linear Independence Constraint Qualification (LICQ) for an equality-constrained optimization problem in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The analysis involves finding the feasible points, determining the condition for LICQ failure, and then counting the number of feasible points at which LICQ fails.\n\nThe two equality constraints are given by:\n$h_{1}(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{2} - 1 = 0$\n$h_{2}(x,y) = (x-1)^{2} + y^{2} - 1 = 0$\n\nThe feasible set consists of all points $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that simultaneously satisfy both constraints. At any feasible point, both constraints are active by definition.\n\n**Step 1: Jacobian and LICQ Criterion**\nThe LICQ requires that the gradients of all active constraints at a feasible point are linearly independent. We first compute the gradients of the constraint functions $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ with respect to the variables $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe gradient of $h_{1}$ is:\n$$ \\nabla h_{1}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial h_{1}}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial h_{1}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x \\\\ 2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe gradient of $h_{2}$ is:\n$$ \\nabla h_{2}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial h_{2}}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial h_{2}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(x-1) \\\\ 2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe Jacobian of the constraints, denoted $J(x,y)$, is the matrix whose rows are the transposes of these gradient vectors:\n$$ J(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\nabla h_{1}(x,y))^{T} \\\\ (\\nabla h_{2}(x,y))^{T} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x  2y \\\\ 2(x-1)  2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe LICQ holds at a point $(x,y)$ if the rows of $J(x,y)$ are linearly independent. For a square matrix, this is equivalent to the condition that its determinant is non-zero. Therefore, LICQ holds if $\\det(J(x,y)) \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Solving for Feasible Points**\nTo find the feasible points, we must solve the system of two non-linear equations:\n$1. \\quad x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$\n$2. \\quad (x-1)^{2} + y^{2} = 1$\n\nFrom equation ($1$), we can express $y^{2}$ as $y^{2} = 1 - x^{2}$. Substituting this into equation ($2$):\n$$ (x-1)^{2} + (1 - x^{2}) = 1 $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ (x^{2} - 2x + 1) + 1 - x^{2} = 1 $$\nThe $x^{2}$ terms cancel out:\n$$ -2x + 2 = 1 $$\nSolving for $x$:\n$$ -2x = 1 - 2 = -1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nNow, we substitute this value of $x$ back into the expression for $y^{2}$:\n$$ y^{2} = 1 - x^{2} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThis gives two possible values for $y$:\n$$ y = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\nThus, there are two feasible points, which are the intersection points of the two circles defined by the constraints:\n$P_{1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$ and $P_{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 3: Locus of LICQ Failure and Geometric Meaning**\nLICQ fails when the constraint gradients are linearly dependent. This occurs when the determinant of the Jacobian is zero.\n$$ \\det(J(x,y)) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2x  2y \\\\ 2(x-1)  2y \\end{pmatrix} = (2x)(2y) - (2y)(2(x-1)) $$\n$$ \\det(J(x,y)) = 4xy - 4y(x-1) = 4xy - 4xy + 4y = 4y $$\nSo, the gradients are linearly dependent if and only if $4y = 0$, which simplifies to $y=0$. The locus of points in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ where LICQ fails is the x-axis.\n\nThe geometric meaning of this locus is as follows:\n- The constraint $h_{1}=0$ defines a circle centered at $(0,0)$ with radius $1$. The gradient $\\nabla h_{1}(x,y)$ is a vector normal to this circle at the point $(x,y)$ and points radially from the center $(0,0)$.\n- The constraint $h_{2}=0$ defines a circle centered at $(1,0)$ with radius $1$. The gradient $\\nabla h_{2}(x,y)$ is a vector normal to this circle at $(x,y)$ and points radially from its center $(1,0)$.\n- The two gradient vectors are linearly dependent (collinear) if and only if the point $(x,y)$ lies on the line connecting the centers of the two circles. The centers are $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$, so the line connecting them is the x-axis, defined by the equation $y=0$. This confirms that the locus of linear dependence is the x-axis. Points of tangency between the two constraint surfaces, if they existed, would belong to this locus.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion on LICQ Failure at Feasible Points**\nWe must determine how many feasible points lie on the locus where LICQ fails.\n- The feasible points are $P_{1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$ and $P_{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$.\n- The locus where LICQ fails is the set of all points $(x,y)$ such that $y=0$.\n\nNow we check if the feasible points satisfy the condition for LICQ failure:\n- For $P_{1}$, the y-coordinate is $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\neq 0$. Therefore, LICQ holds at $P_{1}$.\n- For $P_{2}$, the y-coordinate is $y = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\neq 0$. Therefore, LICQ holds at $P_{2}$.\n\nSince neither of the feasible points have a y-coordinate of $0$, neither lies on the locus where the constraint gradients are linearly dependent. Consequently, LICQ holds at all feasible points for this problem.\n\nThe number of feasible points at which LICQ fails is $0$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ) for a given constrained set at a specific point. The analysis proceeds by following the specified steps: validation, identification of the active set, calculation of gradients, formation of the active-constraint gradient matrix, and computation of its rank.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement. The problem provides a set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ defined by the constraints:\nEquality constraint: $h(x,y) = x+y = 0$.\nInequality constraints: $g_{1}(x,y) \\implies x \\le 0$ and $g_{2}(x,y) \\implies y \\le 0$.\nThe point of interest is $x^{\\star} = (0,0)$.\nAll concepts are standard in the field of mathematical optimization. We must verify that the point $x^{\\star}$ is a feasible point, meaning it satisfies all constraints.\nFor the equality constraint: $h(0,0) = 0+0 = 0$. The constraint is satisfied.\nFor the first inequality constraint: at $(0,0)$, we have $0 \\le 0$. The constraint is satisfied.\nFor the second inequality constraint: at $(0,0)$, we have $0 \\le 0$. The constraint is satisfied.\nSince $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$ satisfies all constraints, it is a feasible point. The problem is well-defined, self-contained, and scientifically sound. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to identify the set of active constraints at the point $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$. A constraint is considered active at a point if it is satisfied with equality at that point.\n1.  The equality constraint $h(x,y) = x+y = 0$ is, by definition, active at any feasible point. At $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$, we have $0+0=0$.\n2.  The first inequality constraint is $x \\le 0$. At $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$, we have $x=0$, so the constraint holds with equality. Therefore, this constraint is active. We can define the constraint function as $c_1(x,y) = x$.\n3.  The second inequality constraint is $y \\le 0$. At $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$, we have $y=0$, so the constraint also holds with equality. Therefore, this constraint is active. We can define the constraint function as $c_2(x,y) = y$.\n\nThe active set at $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$ thus consists of all three constraints: $h(x,y)=0$, $x=0$, and $y=0$.\n\nThe second step is to compute the gradients of the functions defining these active constraints at the point $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$. The variables are $x$ and $y$.\n1.  For the equality constraint, the function is $h(x,y) = x+y$. Its gradient is a vector of its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n    $$ \\nabla h(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    This gradient is constant for all $(x,y)$, so at $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$, $\\nabla h(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n2.  For the first active inequality constraint, the function is $c_1(x,y) = x$. Its gradient is:\n    $$ \\nabla c_1(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial c_1}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial c_1}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    At $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$, $\\nabla c_1(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that the problem text uses $g_1$ to refer to the constraint; we associate this gradient with $g_1$.\n\n3.  For the second active inequality constraint, the function is $c_2(x,y) = y$. Its gradient is:\n    $$ \\nabla c_2(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial c_2}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial c_2}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    At $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$, $\\nabla c_2(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We associate this gradient with $g_2$.\n\nThe set of active constraint gradients at $x^{\\star}$ is $\\{\\nabla h(x^{\\star}), \\nabla c_1(x^{\\star}), \\nabla c_2(x^{\\star})\\} = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$.\n\nThe third step is to form the active-constraint gradient matrix $J$ by stacking these gradients as columns.\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\nabla h(x^{\\star})  \\nabla c_1(x^{\\star})  \\nabla c_2(x^{\\star}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe fourth step is to compute the rank of this matrix, $r = \\operatorname{rank}(J)$. The matrix $J$ is a $2 \\times 3$ matrix. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns (or rows), and it cannot exceed the smaller of its number of rows and columns. Thus, $\\operatorname{rank}(J) \\le \\min(2, 3) = 2$.\nTo find the rank, we can look for the largest square submatrix with a non-zero determinant. Let's consider the $2 \\times 2$ submatrix formed by the second and third columns of $J$:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this submatrix is $\\det(M) = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1$. Since the determinant is non-zero, this $2 \\times 2$ submatrix has rank $2$. This implies that the rank of the full matrix $J$ must be at least $2$.\nSince we know $\\operatorname{rank}(J) \\le 2$ and we have shown $\\operatorname{rank}(J) \\ge 2$, we conclude that the rank is exactly $2$. So, $r = \\operatorname{rank}(J) = 2$.\n\nThe final step is to decide whether the linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ) holds at $x^{\\star}$. The LICQ holds at a feasible point $x^{\\star}$ if and only if the set of active constraint gradients at $x^{\\star}$ is linearly independent.\nIn our case, the set of active constraint gradients is $\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$. This is a set of $3$ vectors in the $2$-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Any set of $m$ vectors in an $n$-dimensional space is linearly dependent if $m > n$. Here, $3 > 2$, so the set of gradient vectors is necessarily linearly dependent.\nWe can show this explicitly by finding a non-trivial linear combination that equals the zero vector:\n$$ 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-1-0 \\\\ 1-0-1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince the set of active constraint gradients is linearly dependent, the LICQ does not hold at $x^{\\star}=(0,0)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the computed rank $r$ as the final answer.\nThe computed rank is $r=2$.",

The final answer required is the unique parameter value $t^{\\star}$ at which LICQ fails for the second system.\n\nThe LICQ is a condition on the constraints of an optimization problem. At a feasible point $\\mathbf{x}$, let $\\mathcal{E}$ be the set of indices for equality constraints $h_i(\\mathbf{x})=0$, and let $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathbf{x})$ be the set of indices for active inequality constraints, i.e., $j \\in \\mathcal{A}(\\mathbf{x})$ if $g_j(\\mathbf{x})=0$.

The equality constraint is satisfied.\n$g(0,0) = 0 \\le 0$. The inequality constraint is satisfied.\nThus, $(0,0)$ is a feasible point.\n\nNext, we identify the active constraints at $(0,0)$. Equality constraints are always considered active. The inequality constraint $g(x,y) \\le 0$ is active because $g(0,0) = 0$. Therefore, both $h(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are active at $(0,0)$.\n\nWe now compute the gradients of these active constraints. The gradient of a scalar function $f(x,y)$ is $\\nabla f = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $h(x,y) = y - x^2$, the gradient is $\\nabla h(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2x \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $g(x,y) = x$, the gradient is $\\nabla g(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nEvaluating these gradients at the point $(0,0)$:\n$\\nabla h(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2(0) \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\nabla g(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo check if LICQ holds, we must determine if the set of vectors $\\{\\nabla h(0,0), \\nabla g(0,0)\\} = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$ is linearly independent. We test this by seeking coefficients $c_1, c_2$ such that the linear combination is the zero vector:\n$c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis vector equation expands into a system of linear equations:\n$c_2 = 0$\n$c_1 = 0$\nThe only solution is the trivial one, $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 0$. Therefore, the gradient vectors are linearly independent, and LICQ holds at the point $(0,0)$ for the first system.\n\nNow, we analyze the modified system to find the parameter value $t^{\\star}$ where LICQ fails.\nSystem 2:\nEquality constraint: $\\tilde{h}(x,y) = y - x^3 = 0$.\nInequality constraint: $\\tilde{g}(x,y) = y \\le 0$.\n\nThe problem defines a parametrization of the feasible set. Points on the equality-constraint manifold satisfy $y = x^3$. Using the parameter $t$, we can represent any such point as $(x(t), y(t)) = (t, t^3)$.\nFor a point to be feasible, it must also satisfy the inequality constraint $\\tilde{g}(x,y) \\le 0$, which is $y \\le 0$. Substituting the parametrization, we get $t^3 \\le 0$, which implies $t \\le 0$.\nThe set of feasible points is therefore $\\{(t, t^3) \\mid t \\le 0\\}$.\n\nWe will now check for LICQ failure at points along this feasible curve.\nFirst, we find the active constraints at a feasible point $(t, t^3)$ for $t \\le 0$.\nThe equality constraint $\\tilde{h}(x,y)=0$ is active at all feasible points by definition.\nThe inequality constraint $\\tilde{g}(x,y) \\le 0$ is active when $\\tilde{g}(x,y) = 0$, which means $y=0$. For a point $(t, t^3)$ on the curve, this condition becomes $t^3=0$, which implies $t=0$.\n\nThis gives two cases to analyze for $t \\le 0$:\nCase 1: $t  0$. At any point $(t, t^3)$ with $t0$, the only active constraint is $\\tilde{h}(x,y)=0$.\nCase 2: $t = 0$. At the point $(0,0)$, both $\\tilde{h}(x,y)=0$ and $\\tilde{g}(x,y)=y \\le 0$ are active.\n\nLet's compute the gradients of the constraints:\n$\\nabla \\tilde{h}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3x^2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\nabla \\tilde{g}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we assess LICQ in each case.\nCase 1: $t  0$.\nThe point is $(t, t^3)$. The only active constraint gradient is $\\nabla \\tilde{h}(t, t^3) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3t^2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor LICQ to hold, the set containing this single vector must be linearly independent. A set with one vector is linearly independent if and only if the vector is not the zero vector. Here, since $t0$, $t^2  0$, so the gradient $\\begin{pmatrix} -3t^2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is never the zero vector. Thus, LICQ holds for all $t  0$.\n\nCase 2: $t = 0$.\nThe point is $(0,0)$. Both constraints are active. We must check the linear independence of the set of gradients $\\{\\nabla \\tilde{h}(0,0), \\nabla \\tilde{g}(0,0)\\}$.\n$\\nabla \\tilde{h}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3(0)^2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\nabla \\tilde{g}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe set of active gradients is $\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$.\nSince the two vectors in the set are identical (and non-zero), the set is linearly dependent. For instance, a non-trivial linear combination that yields the zero vector is $1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTherefore, LICQ fails at the point $(0,0)$, which corresponds to the parameter value $t=0$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only point in the feasible set where LICQ fails is $(0,0)$, corresponding to the parameter value $t=0$. This is the unique parameter value $t^{\\star}$ requested.",
