            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of a computational procedure to estimate two quantities and their confidence intervals based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The foundation of this procedure rests on the principles of sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\nFirst, we formalize the random variables of interest. The perturbation vector $\\delta$ is a $d$-dimensional random variable drawn from a multivariate normal distribution, $\\delta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I_d)$, where $I_d$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix. The projection of this perturbation onto a fixed vector $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ defines a new one-dimensional random variable, $Z = w^\\top \\delta$. Since $Z$ is a linear combination of independent Gaussian random variables, it is itself a Gaussian random variable. Its mean is $\\mathbb{E}[Z] = \\mathbb{E}[w^\\top \\delta] = w^\\top \\mathbb{E}[\\delta] = w^\\top 0 = 0$. Its variance is $\\text{Var}(Z) = \\text{Var}(w^\\top \\delta) = w^\\top \\text{Cov}(\\delta) w = w^\\top (\\sigma^2 I_d) w = \\sigma^2 w^\\top w = \\sigma^2 \\|w\\|_2^2$. Thus, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 \\|w\\|_2^2)$.\n\nThe problem defines two key quantities derived from $Z$. First, the adversarial hinge loss, $L_{\\text{adv}}(\\delta) = \\max(0, m - w^\\top \\delta) = \\max(0, m - Z)$. This is a transformation of the random variable $Z$. Second, the robust accuracy, $p = \\mathbb{P}( L_{\\text{adv}}(\\delta) = 0 ) = \\mathbb{P}(m - w^\\top \\delta \\le 0) = \\mathbb{P}(Z \\ge m)$.\n\nThe analytic calculation of the expected loss $\\mathbb{E}[L_{\\text{adv}}]$ or the probability $p$ would require integrating the probability density function of $Z$, an approach prohibited by the problem statement. Instead, we must rely on a Monte Carlo simulation and the Central Limit Theorem. The simulation process involves generating $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples, $\\{\\delta_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, from the distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I_d)$. For each sample $\\delta_i$, we compute the corresponding scalar projection $z_i = w^\\top \\delta_i$. This gives us a set of i.i.d. samples $\\{z_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ from the distribution of $Z$. From these samples, we generate two sets of i.i.d. random variables: a set of hinge losses, $\\{L_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $L_i = \\max(0, m - z_i)$, and a set of indicator variables, $\\{Y_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $Y_i = \\mathbb{I}\\{z_i \\ge m\\}$. Each $Y_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable with success probability $p$. The core of the task is to estimate the population means of $L_{\\text{adv}}$ and $Y$ and to construct confidence intervals for these means using the CLT.\n\nTo estimate the mean adversarial loss and its confidence interval, let $\\mu_L = \\mathbb{E}[L_{\\text{adv}}]$ be the true mean adversarial loss. The sample mean, $\\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} L_i$, is an unbiased estimator of $\\mu_L$. The Central Limit Theorem states that for a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal:\n$$\n\\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_L, \\frac{\\sigma_L^2}{n}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_L^2 = \\text{Var}(L_{\\text{adv}})$ is the true variance of the loss. Since $\\sigma_L^2$ is unknown, we estimate it using the unbiased sample variance, $S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (L_i - \\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}})^2$. The quantity $\\frac{\\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}} - \\mu_L}{S/\\sqrt{n}}$ approximately follows a standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. To construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\mu_L$, we find the value $z_{0.975}$ such that $\\mathbb{P}(-z_{0.975} \\le \\mathcal{N}(0,1) \\le z_{0.975}) = 0.95$. This gives the interval $\\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}} \\pm z_{0.975} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$. Using the given value $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.959964$, the confidence interval bounds are $\\text{CI}_{\\text{low}}(\\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}}) = \\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}} - 1.959964 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{S^2}{n}}$ and $\\text{CI}_{\\text{high}}(\\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}}) = \\overline{L}_{\\text{adv}} + 1.959964 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{S^2}{n}}$.\n\nTo estimate the robust accuracy and its confidence interval, we note that $p = \\mathbb{P}(Z \\ge m)$. The variable $Y_i = \\mathbb{I}\\{z_i \\ge m\\}$ is a Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$. The sample proportion, $\\widehat{p} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$, is the sample mean of these Bernoulli variables and serves as an unbiased estimator of $p$. The CLT, in the form of the De Moivre-Laplace Theorem, states that for large $n$, $\\widehat{p} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right)$. The standard error of $\\widehat{p}$ is $\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$. Since $p$ is unknown, we substitute its estimate $\\widehat{p}$ to get the estimated standard error, $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}$. The standardized quantity $\\frac{\\widehat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})/n}}$ is approximately $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. This leads to the Wald-type $95\\%$ confidence interval for $p$, given by $\\widehat{p} \\pm z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}$. The initial bounds are $\\text{CI}_{\\text{low}}'(p) = \\widehat{p} - 1.959964 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}$ and $\\text{CI}_{\\text{high}}'(p) = \\widehat{p} + 1.959964 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}$. Since $p$ is a probability, it must be in the range $[0, 1]$. We clip the bounds to ensure they lie within this range: $\\text{CI}_{\\text{low}}(p) = \\max(0, \\text{CI}_{\\text{low}}'(p))$ and $\\text{CI}_{\\text{high}}(p) = \\min(1, \\text{CI}_{\\text{high}}'(p))$. This completes the theoretical framework. The implementation will follow these steps for each test case.",

The constraint to use the CLT is a standard directive in statistical problems to justify the use of a normal approximation for a sample mean, which is appropriate here. The problem is mathematically and scientifically sound.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is divided into three parts: deriving the asymptotic sampling distributions, justifying the normality-based bounds, and computing the numerical value of the bound radius $R$.\n\n**1. Asymptotic Sampling Distribution of $\\bar{\\mu}_{B}$**\n\nLet $X_{i,b}$ be the $i$-th pre-activation in the $b$-th mini-batch, for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $b \\in \\{1, \\dots, B\\}$. By assumption, $X_{i,b} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ are i.i.d.\n\nFor a single mini-batch $b$, the sample mean is $\\hat{\\mu}_{b} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i,b}$. Since the sum of independent normal random variables is also normal, $\\hat{\\mu}_{b}$ is exactly normally distributed. Its expectation and variance are:\n$$E[\\hat{\\mu}_{b}] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i,b}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_{i,b}] = \\frac{1}{n} (n\\mu) = \\mu$$\n$$Var(\\hat{\\mu}_{b}) = Var\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i,b}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Var(X_{i,b}) = \\frac{1}{n^2} (n\\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$$\nSo, for each batch $b$, the sample mean is a random variable $\\hat{\\mu}_{b} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)$.\n\nThe averaged statistic $\\bar{\\mu}_{B}$ is the sample mean of $B$ i.i.d. random variables $\\hat{\\mu}_{1}, \\dots, \\hat{\\mu}_{B}$. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that for a large number of i.i.d. random variables, their sample mean is approximately normally distributed. Applying the CLT to the sequence $\\{\\hat{\\mu}_b\\}_{b=1}^B$, the asymptotic distribution of $\\bar{\\mu}_{B}$ as $B \\to \\infty$ is:\n$$\\bar{\\mu}_{B} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(E[\\hat{\\mu}_{b}], \\frac{Var(\\hat{\\mu}_{b})}{B}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the moments of $\\hat{\\mu}_{b}$:\n$$\\bar{\\mu}_{B} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2/n}{B}\\right) = \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{nB}\\right)$$\n(Note: Since each $\\hat{\\mu}_b$ is already normal, their mean $\\bar{\\mu}_B$ is exactly normal, but the problem requires justification via the CLT, which we have provided.)\n\n**2. Asymptotic Sampling Distribution of $\\bar{\\sigma}_{B}^{2}$**\n\nFor a single mini-batch $b$, the unbiased sample variance is $\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_{i,b} - \\hat{\\mu}_{b})^2$.\nFor data from a normal distribution, the quantity $\\frac{(n-1)\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2}}{\\sigma^2}$ follows a chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom, i.e., $\\frac{(n-1)\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2}}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\chi_{n-1}^2$.\n\nFrom this, we can find the expectation and variance of $\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2}$. The mean and variance of a $\\chi_k^2$ random variable are $k$ and $2k$, respectively.\n$$E[\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2}] = E\\left[\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n-1} \\chi_{n-1}^2\\right] = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n-1} E[\\chi_{n-1}^2] = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n-1} (n-1) = \\sigma^2$$\nThis confirms that $\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\\sigma^2$.\n$$Var(\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2}) = Var\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n-1} \\chi_{n-1}^2\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n-1}\\right)^2 Var(\\chi_{n-1}^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^4}{(n-1)^2} [2(n-1)] = \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-1}$$\nThe averaged statistic $\\bar{\\sigma}_{B}^{2}$ is the sample mean of $B$ i.i.d. random variables $\\hat{\\sigma}_{1}^{2}, \\dots, \\hat{\\sigma}_{B}^{2}$. These variables are not normally distributed; they follow a scaled chi-squared distribution. Therefore, we must invoke the CLT to find the asymptotic distribution of their mean, $\\bar{\\sigma}_{B}^{2}$. As $B \\to \\infty$, the CLT gives:\n$$\\bar{\\sigma}_{B}^{2} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(E[\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2}], \\frac{Var(\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2})}{B}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the moments of $\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}^{2}$:\n$$\\bar{\\sigma}_{B}^{2} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\sigma^2, \\frac{2\\sigma^4/(n-1)}{B}\\right) = \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\sigma^2, \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{B(n-1)}\\right)$$\n\n**3. Justification for Normality-Based Uncertainty Bounds**\n\nThe asymptotic normality of both $\\bar{\\mu}_{B}$ and $\\bar{\\sigma}_{B}^{2}$, as established by the CLT, is the justification for using normality-based uncertainty bounds. For a large number of batches $B$, the sampling distributions of these running averages can be well-approximated by normal distributions. A symmetric $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for a normally distributed estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ with mean $\\theta$ and variance $V$ is given by $\\hat{\\theta} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{V}$. The problem asks for uncertainty bounds centered at the expected values of the estimators. The half-width of such a bound is $z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\text{estimator})}$.\n\n**4. Computation of the Bound Radius $R$**\n\nWe are given $n = 128$, $B = 50$, $\\mu = 0.2$, and $\\sigma = 0.9$. The confidence level is $0.95$, so $\\alpha = 0.05$. The critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$. We will use the standard approximation $z_{0.975} = 1.96$.\n\nFirst, we compute the half-width of the uncertainty bound for $\\bar{\\mu}_{B}$, which we denote $R_{\\mu}$.\n$$R_{\\mu} = z_{0.975} \\sqrt{Var(\\bar{\\mu}_{B})} = z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{nB}}$$\nSubstituting the values: $\\sigma^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81$.\n$$R_{\\mu} = 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.81}{128 \\times 50}} = 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.81}{6400}} = 1.96 \\times \\frac{0.9}{80} = 1.96 \\times 0.01125 = 0.02205$$\n\nNext, we compute the half-width of the uncertainty bound for $\\bar{\\sigma}_{B}^{2}$, which we denote $R_{\\sigma^2}$.\n$$R_{\\sigma^2} = z_{0.975} \\sqrt{Var(\\bar{\\sigma}_{B}^{2})} = z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^4}{B(n-1)}}$$\nSubstituting the values: $\\sigma^4 = (0.81)^2 = 0.6561$ and $n-1 = 127$.\n$$R_{\\sigma^2} = 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 0.6561}{50 \\times 127}} = 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{1.3122}{6350}} \\approx 1.96 \\sqrt{0.00020664567}$$\n$$R_{\\sigma^2} \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.0143751754 \\approx 0.0281753439$$\n\nThe bound radius $R$ is defined as the larger of these two half-widths.\n$$R = \\max(R_{\\mu}, R_{\\sigma^2}) = \\max(0.02205, 0.0281753439) = 0.0281753439$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$R \\approx 0.02818$$",

All conditions and definitions are standard in the field of statistical learning and asymptotic theory. The problem is a formal exercise in probability and statistics, specifically regarding the properties of subsampling estimators. I will proceed with the required derivations.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive the asymptotic distribution of $Z_{b}=\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\mu)$. Second, we compute the exact expected bias of the conditional variance of the subsampling pivot $T_{b}=\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n})$ as an estimator of the population variance $\\sigma^{2}$.\n\n**Part 1: Asymptotic Distribution of $Z_{b}$**\n\nWe are asked to derive the asymptotic distribution of $Z_{b}=\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\mu)$ by decomposing it as follows:\n$$Z_{b} = \\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n}) + \\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu)$$\nWe will analyze the asymptotic behavior of each term under the regime where $n\\to\\infty$, $b\\to\\infty$, and $b/n\\to 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the second term, $\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu)$. We can rewrite this term as:\n$$\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu) = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{n}} \\left( \\sqrt{n}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu) \\right)$$\nThe sample $\\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$ consists of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean $\\mathbb{E}[X_{1}]=\\mu$ and variance $\\operatorname{Var}(X_{1})=\\sigma^{2} \\in (0,\\infty)$. The condition $\\mathbb{E}|X_{1}|^{3}\\infty$ implies that the second moment is finite. By the classical Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the term $\\sqrt{n}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu)$ converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$:\n$$\\sqrt{n}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^{2}) \\text{ as } n\\to\\infty$$\nThe notation $\\xrightarrow{d}$ denotes convergence in distribution. A sequence of random variables that converges in distribution is stochastically bounded (or tight).\nThe problem specifies that $b/n \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Consequently, the pre-factor $\\sqrt{b/n}$ converges to $0$:\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{n}} \\to 0 \\text{ as } n\\to\\infty$$\nBy Slutsky's theorem, the product of a sequence of random variables converging in distribution and a sequence of constants converging to $0$ converges in probability to $0$. Let $A_{n} = \\sqrt{n}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu)$ and $c_{n} = \\sqrt{b/n}$. Since $A_{n} \\xrightarrow{d} A \\sim N(0, \\sigma^{2})$ and $c_{n} \\to 0$, we have $c_{n}A_{n} \\xrightarrow{d} 0 \\cdot A = 0$. Convergence in distribution to a constant is equivalent to convergence in probability. Thus,\n$$\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu) \\xrightarrow{p} 0 \\text{ as } n\\to\\infty$$\nwhere $\\xrightarrow{p}$ denotes convergence in probability.\n\nNow, let's analyze the first term, $\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n})$. This term represents the fluctuation of the subsample mean around the full-sample mean, arising from the without-replacement sampling process. We analyze its behavior conditional on the observed sample $\\mathcal{X}_{n} = \\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$. Conditionally, we are sampling from a fixed finite population of size $n$ with values $\\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$. The mean of this population is $\\bar{X}_{n}$ and its variance is $S_{n}^{2}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i}-\\bar{X}_{n})^{2}$.\n\nThe subsample mean $\\bar{X}_{b}$ has a conditional variance given by the standard formula for simple random sampling without replacement:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{pop}^{2}}{b} \\left(1 - \\frac{b}{n}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{pop}^{2} = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i}-\\bar{X}_{n})^{2}$ is the (unbiased) population variance. In terms of the given $S_{n}^{2}$, we have $\\sigma_{pop}^{2} = \\frac{n}{n-1}S_{n}^{2}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}) = \\frac{1}{b}\\frac{n}{n-1}S_{n}^{2} \\left(\\frac{n-b}{n}\\right) = \\frac{S_{n}^{2}}{b}\\frac{n-b}{n-1}$$\nThe variance of the term $\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n})$ conditional on $\\mathcal{X}_{n}$ is:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n}) \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) = b\\,\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}) = S_{n}^{2}\\frac{n-b}{n-1}$$\nBy the Law of Large Numbers, $\\bar{X}_{n} \\xrightarrow{p} \\mu$ and $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{2} \\xrightarrow{p} \\mathbb{E}[X_{1}^{2}] = \\sigma^{2}+\\mu^{2}$. By the continuous mapping theorem, $S_{n}^{2} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{2} - \\bar{X}_{n}^{2} \\xrightarrow{p} (\\sigma^{2}+\\mu^{2}) - \\mu^{2} = \\sigma^{2}$. The factor $\\frac{n-b}{n-1} = \\frac{1-b/n}{1-1/n} \\to 1$ since $b/n \\to 0$. Therefore, the conditional variance converges in probability to $\\sigma^{2}$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n}) \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) \\xrightarrow{p} \\sigma^{2}$$\nA central limit theorem for sampling without replacement from a sequence of finite populations (e.g., by Hájek) states that under the conditions $b\\to\\infty$, $n-b\\to\\infty$ (which is implied by $b/n\\to 0$), and a Lindeberg-type condition on the finite population values, the normalized sample mean is asymptotically normal. The condition $\\mathbb{E}|X_{1}|^{3}\\infty$ ensures the sample behaves sufficiently well for this CLT to hold in probability. Thus, conditional on $\\mathcal{X}_{n}$, we have $\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n}) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^{2})$. Since the limiting distribution does not depend on the specific realization of $\\mathcal{X}_{n}$, this convergence also holds unconditionally:\n$$\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n}) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^{2})$$\nUsing Slutsky's theorem on the decomposition of $Z_{b}$, we combine the two results. Let $A_{n} = \\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n})$ and $B_{n} = \\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu)$. We have $A_{n} \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^{2})$ and $B_{n} \\xrightarrow{p} 0$. Therefore, their sum converges in distribution to $N(0, \\sigma^{2})$:\n$$Z_{b} = A_{n} + B_{n} \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^{2})$$\n\n**Part 2: Conditional Moments and Expected Bias**\n\nWe are asked to derive the conditional mean and variance of $T_{b}=\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n})$ given $\\mathcal{X}_{n}=\\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$, and then compute an expected bias.\n\nConditional on $\\mathcal{X}_{n}$, the values $\\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$ are fixed constants. Let $I_{i}$ be an indicator variable such that $I_{i}=1$ if $X_{i}$ is in the subsample of size $b$, and $I_{i}=0$ otherwise. The subsample mean is $\\bar{X}_{b}=\\frac{1}{b}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}I_{i}X_{i}$.\n\nThe conditional mean of $T_{b}$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[T_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{b}-\\bar{X}_{n}) \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}] = \\sqrt{b}\\,(\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}]-\\bar{X}_{n})$$\nFor uniform sampling without replacement, $\\mathbb{P}(I_{i}=1) = b/n$. The conditional expectation of $\\bar{X}_{b}$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{b}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}I_{i}X_{i} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right] = \\frac{1}{b}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\\mathbb{E}[I_{i}] = \\frac{1}{b}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\\left(\\frac{b}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i} = \\bar{X}_{n}$$\nThus, the conditional mean is $\\mathbb{E}[T_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}] = \\sqrt{b}\\,(\\bar{X}_{n}-\\bar{X}_{n})=0$.\n\nThe conditional variance of $T_{b}$ is $\\operatorname{Var}(T_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}) = b\\,\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{X}_{b} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n})$.
