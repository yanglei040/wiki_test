The residuals (predicted minus true) are observed as follows. For model $X$, the residuals are $-0.5$ for $9$ samples and $10$ for $1$ sample. For model $Y$, the residuals are $-1.8$ for $5$ samples and $+1.8$ for $5$ samples. Without using any pre-given formulas, determine which model is ranked better by Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and which is ranked better by Mean Squared Error (MSE), and select the option that correctly explains why the rankings reverse by referencing appropriate residual distribution moments.

            "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A deep learning regression task involves two models, $X$ and $Y$.\n- The number of hold-out samples is $n=10$.\n- The residuals for model $X$, denoted as the set $R_X$, consist of $9$ values of $-0.5$ and $1$ value of $10$.\n- The residuals for model $Y$, denoted as the set $R_Y$, consist of $5$ values of $-1.8$ and $5$ values of $1.8$.\n- The task is to determine which model is ranked better by Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and to explain the potential reversal of rankings by referencing residual distribution moments.\n- The constraint is to solve \"without using any pre-given formulas,\" which is interpreted as deriving the results from the fundamental definitions of the metrics.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental and standard concepts in statistics and machine learning evaluation: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the analysis of residual distributions using statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis). These are well-established and core to the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary numerical data to calculate the required metrics. The sets of residuals are fully specified, and the number of samples is consistent. The question is unambiguous, leading to a unique, calculable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective language and numerical data. It is free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound, and objective question that tests the understanding of regression metrics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe metrics are defined from first principles as follows. For a set of $n$ residuals $\\{r_i\\}_{i=1}^n$:\n- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** is the average of the absolute values of the residuals: $MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n |r_i|$.\n- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is the average of the squared values of the residuals: $MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2$.\nA lower value for either metric indicates a better-performing model.\n\n**Calculation for Model X:**\nThe residuals are $R_X = \\{ \\underbrace{-0.5, \\dots, -0.5}_{9 \\text{ times}}, 10 \\}$. The number of samples is $n=10$.\n\n- **MAE for Model X ($MAE_X$):**\n$$MAE_X = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 9 \\times |-0.5| + 1 \\times |10| \\right)$$\n$$MAE_X = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 9 \\times 0.5 + 10 \\right)$$\n$$MAE_X = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 4.5 + 10 \\right) = \\frac{14.5}{10} = 1.45$$\n\n- **MSE for Model X ($MSE_X$):**\n$$MSE_X = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 9 \\times (-0.5)^2 + 1 \\times (10)^2 \\right)$$\n$$MSE_X = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 9 \\times 0.25 + 100 \\right)$$\n$$MSE_X = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 2.25 + 100 \\right) = \\frac{102.25}{10} = 10.225$$\n\n**Calculation for Model Y:**\nThe residuals are $R_Y = \\{ \\underbrace{-1.8, \\dots, -1.8}_{5 \\text{ times}}, \\underbrace{1.8, \\dots, 1.8}_{5 \\text{ times}} \\}$. The number of samples is $n=10$.\n\n- **MAE for Model Y ($MAE_Y$):**\n$$MAE_Y = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 5 \\times |-1.8| + 5 \\times |1.8| \\right)$$\n$$MAE_Y = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 5 \\times 1.8 + 5 \\times 1.8 \\right)$$\n$$MAE_Y = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 10 \\times 1.8 \\right) = 1.8$$\n\n- **MSE for Model Y ($MSE_Y$):**\n$$MSE_Y = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 5 \\times (-1.8)^2 + 5 \\times (1.8)^2 \\right)$$\n$$MSE_Y = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 10 \\times (1.8)^2 \\right)$$\n$$MSE_Y = (1.8)^2 = 3.24$$\n\n**Comparison of Rankings:**\n- **MAE:** $MAE_X = 1.45$ and $MAE_Y = 1.8$. Since $1.45 < 1.8$, model $X$ is ranked better by MAE.\n- **MSE:** $MSE_X = 10.225$ and $MSE_Y = 3.24$. Since $10.225 > 3.24$, model $Y$ is ranked better by MSE.\n\nThe rankings are indeed reversed.\n\n**Analysis using Residual Distribution Moments:**\n- **MAE** is the first absolute moment about the origin ($E[|R|]$). It treats all errors linearly (in absolute value). For model $X$, the $9$ small errors result in a small contribution to the sum, and the single large outlier contributes linearly ($10$). The overall average remains relatively low.\n- **MSE** is the second moment about the origin ($E[R^2]$). It is related to the variance (the second central moment, $\\sigma^2 = E[(R-\\mu)^2]$) and the mean (the first moment, $\\mu = E[R]$) by the identity $MSE = \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2$. Due to the squaring operation, MSE penalizes large errors disproportionately. For model $X$, the single residual of $10$ contributes $10^2 = 100$ to the sum of squares, dominating the total and resulting in a very high MSE. This sensitivity to extreme outliers is characteristic of MSE.\n- The presence of an extreme outlier, as in the residuals of model $X$, creates a \"heavy-tailed\" distribution. This is quantified by **kurtosis** (the scaled fourth central moment), which for model $X$ would be very high (a leptokurtic distribution). High kurtosis indicates that outliers are more extreme than in a normal distribution, and MSE is highly sensitive to this.\n- The distribution for model $X$ is also asymmetric, as shown by its **skewness** (the scaled third central moment). The single large positive residual creates a strong positive skew. While skewness describes asymmetry, it is the kurtosis and the underlying variance that are most directly connected to the magnitude of the MSE.\n- Model $Y$'s residuals are symmetric around $0$, so its mean and skewness are both $0$. It has no extreme outliers, resulting in a moderate variance and thus a moderate MSE.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $MAE$ prefers model $X$ while $MSE$ prefers model $Y$. This reversal is explained because $MSE$ is driven by the second moment (variance) and becomes large under heavy-tailed residuals with high kurtosis due to the single extreme outlier in $X$, whereas $MAE$ depends on the first absolute moment and is comparatively robust to isolated outliers. The positive skewness in $X$ indicates asymmetry but does not by itself overturn $MAE$’s robustness.**\n- The rankings are correct: our calculations show $MAE$ prefers $X$ and $MSE$ prefers $Y$.\n- The explanation is sound. $MSE$ is indeed driven by the second moment ($E[R^2]$) and is thus closely related to variance. It is extremely sensitive to heavy tails and high kurtosis, which are caused by the outlier in $X$'s residuals.\n- Conversely, $MAE$ ($E[|R|]$) is the first absolute moment and is known to be more robust to such outliers.\n- The statement about skewness is also correct; it indicates asymmetry, but the primary cause of the MSE's large value is the magnitude of the squared error, which is better described in terms of variance and kurtosis.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Both $MAE$ and $MSE$ prefer model $Y$ because its mean residual is $0$, and $MSE$ mainly depends on the mean; the outlier in $X$ does not change the ranking once the mean is accounted for.**\n- The first clause, \"Both $MAE$ and $MSE$ prefer model $Y$,\" is false. Our calculations show $MAE$ prefers model $X$.\n- The reasoning, \"$MSE$ mainly depends on the mean,\" is false. $MSE = \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2$. For model $X$, the mean is $\\mu_X = \\frac{1}{10}(9 \\times -0.5 + 10) = 0.55$, so $\\mu_X^2 = 0.3025$. The variance is $\\sigma_X^2 = MSE_X - \\mu_X^2 = 10.225 - 0.3025 = 9.9225$. The MSE is clearly dominated by the variance, not the mean.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. $MAE$ prefers model $Y$ while $MSE$ prefers model $X$ because $MAE$ amplifies large outliers more strongly than $MSE$, so the extreme residual in $X$ hurts $MAE$ but not $MSE$.**\n- The ranking, \"$MAE$ prefers model $Y$ while $MSE$ prefers model $X$,\" is the exact opposite of what was calculated.\n- The reasoning, \"$MAE$ amplifies large outliers more strongly than $MSE$,\" is fundamentally false. The squaring operation in MSE ($r^2$) causes much stronger amplification of large errors than the absolute value operation in MAE ($|r|$).\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The rankings cannot reverse when there is a single positive outlier; such reversal requires negative skewness. Therefore, with the given residuals, both $MAE$ and $MSE$ prefer the same model.**\n- The premise, \"The rankings cannot reverse when there is a single positive outlier,\" is demonstrably false, as the calculations have shown a reversal.\n- The claim that reversal \"requires negative skewness\" is a baseless and incorrect assertion. The reversal depends on the interplay between the magnitude of the outlier and the distribution of the other residuals, not on the sign of the skew.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. $MAE$ prefers model $X$ and $MSE$ prefers model $Y$, but the reversal is primarily because $MSE$ responds to skewness rather than variance; skewness alone directly increases $MSE$ even if variance is similar.**\n- The initial ranking is correct.\n- The reasoning, \"$MSE$ responds to skewness rather than variance,\" is false. $MSE$ is the second moment about the origin. Variance is the second central moment. Skewness is related to the third central moment. They are distinct concepts. MSE is directly a function of variance and mean, not skewness. High skewness often co-occurs with high variance in outlier-driven distributions, but MSE's value is determined by the variance and mean, not the skewness directly.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "solution": "The solution is derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Oracle Predictors**\nThe expected risk for a predictor $g$ is $R_{\\ell}(g) = \\mathbb{E}[\\ell(Y, g(X))]$. By the law of total expectation, this is $R_{\\ell}(g) = \\mathbb{E}_{X}[\\mathbb{E}_{Y|X}[\\ell(Y, g(X)) | X=x]]$. To minimize this over all functions $g$, we can minimize the inner expectation pointwise for each $x$.

The task reduces to finding a constant $c$ that minimizes $\\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\\ell(f(x) + Z, c)]$.\n\n*   **For squared loss $\\ell_2$**: We minimize $\\mathbb{E}_{Z}[(f(x) + Z - c)^2]$.

The value of $c$ that minimizes the expected absolute deviation from the points in a distribution is the median of that distribution.\n    $$c = \\operatorname{median}(f(x) + Z) = f(x) + \\operatorname{median}(Z).$$\n    Thus, the oracle predictor is $g_1^*(x) = \\operatorname{median}(Y|X=x) = f(x) + \\operatorname{median}(Z)$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of Noise Properties and Oracle Predictors**\nThe noise $Z$ is drawn from a symmetric mixture of two zero-mean Gaussians: $Z \\sim 0.9\\,\\mathcal{N}(0,1) + 0.1\\,\\mathcal{N}(0,25)$.\n*   The mean of $Z$ is $\\mathbb{E}[Z] = 0.9 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{N}(0,1)] + 0.1 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{N}(0,25)] = 0.9 \\cdot 0 + 0.1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   The probability density function of $Z$ is symmetric about 0. Therefore, its median is $\\operatorname{median}(Z) = 0$.\n\nSince both the mean and median of the noise are zero, both oracle predictors are identical:\n$$g_2^*(x) = f(x) + 0 = f(x)$$\n$$g_1^*(x) = f(x) + 0 = f(x)$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Oracle Risks**\nThe oracle risk is the risk achieved by the oracle predictor.\n*   **For squared loss $\\ell_2$**:\n    $$R_2^{\\star} = \\mathbb{E}[\\ell_2(Y, g_2^*(X))] = \\mathbb{E}[( (f(X)+Z) - f(X) )^2] = \\mathbb{E}[Z^2]$$\n    The second moment $\\mathbb{E}[Z^2]$ (which equals the variance since $\\mathbb{E}[Z]=0$) is computed using the law of total expectation over the mixture components:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[Z^2] = 0.9 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{N}(0,1)^2] + 0.1 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{N}(0,25)^2] $$\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[Z^2] = 0.9 \\cdot (1) + 0.1 \\cdot (25) = 0.9 + 2.5 = 3.4 = \\frac{17}{5} $$\n    So, $R_2^{\\star} = \\frac{17}{5}$.\n\n*   **For absolute loss $\\ell_1$**:\n    $$R_1^{\\star} = \\mathbb{E}[\\ell_1(Y, g_1^*(X))] = \\mathbb{E}[| (f(X)+Z) - f(X) |] = \\mathbb{E}[|Z|]$$\n    The mean absolute deviation $\\mathbb{E}[|Z|]$ is also computed over the mixture:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[|Z|] = 0.9 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[|\\mathcal{N}(0,1)|] + 0.1 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[|\\mathcal{N}(0,25)|] $$\n    For a random variable $W \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[|W|] = \\sigma \\sqrt{2/\\pi}$.\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[|Z|] = 0.9 \\cdot \\left(1 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\right) + 0.1 \\cdot \\left(5 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\right) $$\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[|Z|] = (0.9 + 0.5) \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} = 1.4 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} = \\frac{7}{5} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} $$\n    So, $R_1^{\\star} = \\frac{7}{5} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}$.\n\n**Step 4: Justification of Preference**\nWe compare the oracle risks:\n$R_2^{\\star} = 3.4$\n$R_1^{\\star} = \\frac{7}{5} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\approx 1.4 \\times 0.7979 \\approx 1.117$\n\nThe absolute loss yields a significantly lower oracle risk.

The $10\\%$ contaminant component with variance $25$ contributes $0.1 \\times 25 = 2.5$ to the total risk, dominating the value. In contrast, the absolute error risk is the mean absolute deviation, $\\mathbb{E}[|Z|]$. The contaminant component has a standard deviation of $5$, and its contribution to the risk is proportional to this, not its square. Its contribution is $0.1 \\times (5\\sqrt{2/\\pi})$, which is much more tempered. This demonstrates the robustness of the absolute loss: its penalty on outliers grows linearly, while the squared loss's quadratic penalty makes it highly sensitive to the large variance of the heavy-tailed component.",

Summing subgradients, a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is that $0$ belongs to the subdifferential of $R_{1}(c)$, i.e.,\n$$ 0 \\in \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\partial |y_i - c|. $$\nThis holds if and only if the number of sample points $y_i$ less than $c$ is at most the number greater than $c$, and vice versa; equivalently, any sample median satisfies this condition. Hence, any median of the sample minimizes $R_{1}(c)$. Using the standard definition, we take\n$$ c_{1} = \\operatorname{median}(y_1, \\dots, y_n). $$\n\n3. Safety-oriented utility based on median accuracy.\n\nFor a constant predictor $c$, define the safety-oriented utility\n$$ U(c) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\operatorname{median}\\left( |y_i - c| \\right)}. $$\nThe function $\\operatorname{median}\\left( |y_i - c| \\right)$ is the median absolute error of $c$ on the sample. Smaller median absolute error corresponds to better typical performance on a majority of cases, which is aligned with safety-critical preferences that de-emphasize rare extremes. The mapping $x \\mapsto \\frac{1}{1 + x}$ is strictly decreasing for $x \\ge 0$, so maximizing $U(c)$ corresponds to minimizing the median absolute error.\n\n4. Data generation with rare catastrophic values.\n\nGiven parameters $(s, n, p, M, \\mu, \\sigma)$:\n- Initialize a pseudo-random number generator with seed $s$.\n- Draw $y_i^{(0)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ independently for $i = 1, \\dots, n$.\n- For each $i$, draw an independent Bernoulli indicator $Z_i \\sim \\operatorname{Bernoulli}(p)$. Define\n$$ y_i = y_i^{(0)} + M Z_i. $$\nThus, with probability $p$, a catastrophic positive shift of magnitude $M$ occurs.\n\n5. Quantities to compute per test case.\n\nFrom the sample $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$:\n- Compute $c_{2} = \\bar{y}$ and $c_{1} = \\operatorname{median}(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$.\n- Compute\n  $$ R_{2}(c_{2}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - c_{2})^2, \\quad R_{2}(c_{1}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - c_{1})^2, $$\n  $$ R_{1}(c_{2}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - c_{2}|, \\quad R_{1}(c_{1}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - c_{1}|, $$\n  $$ U(c_{2}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\operatorname{median}_i |y_i - c_{2}|}, \\quad U(c_{1}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\operatorname{median}_i |y_i - c_{1}|}. $$\n- Define booleans\n  $$ B_{2} = \\left[ R_{2}(c_{1}) \\le R_{2}(c_{2}) \\right], \\quad B_{1} = \\left[ R_{1}(c_{1}) \\le R_{1}(c_{2}) \\right], \\quad B_{U} = \\left[ U(c_{1}) \\ge U(c_{2}) \\right]. $$\nBecause $c_{2}$ minimizes $R_{2}$ over constants by construction, we generally have $R_{2}(c_{2}) \\le R_{2}(c_{1})$, with equality if $c_{1} = c_{2}$. Similarly, $c_{1}$ minimizes $R_{1}$, so $R_{1}(c_{1}) \\le R_{1}(c_{2})$. The safety utility comparison depends on the sample and is expected to favor $c_{1}$ in the presence of rare catastrophes.\n\n6. Algorithmic design.\n\nImplement the above steps exactly for each test case in the suite:\n- Use the specified seeds to ensure reproducibility.\n- Compute the predictors $c_{2}$ and $c_{1}$ using the sample mean and sample median, respectively.\n- Compute the six scalar metrics and three booleans per test case.\n- Output a single line: a list of five inner lists (one per test case), each inner list containing the nine values in the prescribed order\n$$ [R_{2}(c_{2}), R_{2}(c_{1}), R_{1}(c_{2}), R_{1}(c_{1}), U(c_{2}), U(c_{1}), B_{2}, B_{1}, B_{U}]. $$\nNo other text should be printed.\n\nThe test suite parameters to use are:\n- Test case $1$: $(s, n, p, M, \\mu, \\sigma) = (42, 101, 0.0, 0, 0, 1)$.\n- Test case $2$: $(s, n, p, M, \\mu, \\sigma) = (7, 200, 0.02, 50, 0, 1)$.\n- Test case $3$: $(s, n, p, M, \\mu, \\sigma) = (11, 200, 0.01, 200, 0, 1)$.\n- Test case $4$: $(s, n, p, M, \\mu, \\sigma) = (123, 9, 0.2, 30, 0, 1)$.\n- Test case $5$: $(s, n, p, M, \\mu, \\sigma) = (2024, 500, 0.05, 20, 0, 1)$.\n\nThese cover a baseline with no contamination, rare mild and rare extreme catastrophic shifts, a small-sample condition, and a moderate contamination rate. The outputs are purely numerical and boolean, enabling automated verification.",
