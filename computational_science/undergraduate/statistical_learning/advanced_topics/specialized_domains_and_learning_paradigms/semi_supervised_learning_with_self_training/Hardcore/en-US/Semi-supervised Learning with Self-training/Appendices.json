            "problem": "Consider binary classification with labels $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and class prior $\\pi = \\Pr(y=1) \\in (0,1)$. A fixed classifier produces predictions $\\hat{y} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ with confusion rates $\\alpha = \\Pr(\\hat{y}=1 \\mid y=0)$ and $\\beta = \\Pr(\\hat{y}=0 \\mid y=1)$, and is equipped with calibrated confidence scores so that for any input $x$, the maximum predicted class probability is used as a confidence $c(x) \\in [0,1]$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for two derivations. First, an expression for the expected noise rate $\\eta(\\tau)$ among the added pseudo-labels. Second, an analysis of the expected empirical $0$-$1$ loss on the augmented dataset.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Expected Noise Rate $\\eta(\\tau)$**\n\nThe expected noise rate among the added pseudo-labels is defined as the probability that a pseudo-label is incorrect, conditioned on the instance being selected for pseudo-labeling. The selection criterion is that the confidence $c(X)$ exceeds a threshold $\\tau$. Formally, this is:\n$$\n\\eta(\\tau) = \\Pr\\big(\\hat{y} \\neq y \\,\\big|\\, c(X) \\ge \\tau\\big)\n$$\nWe use the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\n\\eta(\\tau) = \\frac{\\Pr(\\hat{y} \\neq y, c(X) \\ge \\tau)}{\\Pr(c(X) \\ge \\tau)}\n$$\nLet's denote the selection event as $S = \\{c(X) \\ge \\tau\\}$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\eta(\\tau) = \\frac{\\Pr(\\hat{y} \\neq y, S)}{\\Pr(S)}\n$$\nWe will evaluate the numerator and the denominator separately using the law of total probability, conditioning on the true class label $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the denominator, $\\Pr(S) = \\Pr(c(X) \\ge \\tau)$:\n$$\n\\Pr(S) = \\Pr(S \\mid y=0)\\Pr(y=0) + \\Pr(S \\mid y=1)\\Pr(y=1)\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The class prior $\\pi = \\Pr(y=1)$, which implies $\\Pr(y=0) = 1-\\pi$.\n- The class-conditional selection rates $s_{0}(\\tau) = \\Pr(c(X) \\ge \\tau \\mid y=0)$ and $s_{1}(\\tau) = \\Pr(c(X) \\ge \\tau \\mid y=1)$.\n\nSubstituting these givens into the expression for $\\Pr(S)$:\n$$\n\\Pr(S) = s_{0}(\\tau)(1-\\pi) + s_{1}(\\tau)\\pi\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerator, $\\Pr(\\hat{y} \\neq y, S)$. Again, we use the law of total probability, conditioning on the true class $y$:\n$$\n\\Pr(\\hat{y} \\neq y, S) = \\Pr(\\hat{y} \\neq y, S \\mid y=0)\\Pr(y=0) + \\Pr(\\hat{y} \\neq y, S \\mid y=1)\\Pr(y=1)\n$$\nLet's analyze each term in the sum:\n1.  For the case $y=0$, an incorrect prediction means $\\hat{y}=1$. So, the first term is $\\Pr(\\hat{y} = 1, S \\mid y=0)\\Pr(y=0)$.\n2.  For the case $y=1$, an incorrect prediction means $\\hat{y}=0$. So, the second term is $\\Pr(\\hat{y} = 0, S \\mid y=1)\\Pr(y=1)$.\n\nThe problem states a crucial independence assumption: \"within each true class, crossing the threshold $\\tau$ is independent of whether the classifier predicts correctly\".\nThis can be formalized as:\n- Given $y=0$, the event of an incorrect prediction, $\\{\\hat{y}=1\\}$, is independent of the selection event $S$.\n  $$ \\Pr(\\hat{y}=1, S \\mid y=0) = \\Pr(\\hat{y}=1 \\mid y=0) \\Pr(S \\mid y=0) $$\n- Given $y=1$, the event of an incorrect prediction, $\\{\\hat{y}=0\\}$, is independent of the selection event $S$.\n  $$ \\Pr(\\hat{y}=0, S \\mid y=1) = \\Pr(\\hat{y}=0 \\mid y=1) \\Pr(S \\mid y=1) $$\n\nWe are given the confusion rates $\\alpha = \\Pr(\\hat{y}=1 \\mid y=0)$ and $\\beta = \\Pr(\\hat{y}=0 \\mid y=1)$. Using these and the selection rates, the conditional probabilities become:\n- $\\Pr(\\hat{y}=1, S \\mid y=0) = \\alpha \\cdot s_{0}(\\tau)$\n- $\\Pr(\\hat{y}=0, S \\mid y=1) = \\beta \\cdot s_{1}(\\tau)$\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the numerator:\n$$\n\\Pr(\\hat{y} \\neq y, S) = \\big( \\alpha \\cdot s_{0}(\\tau) \\big) (1-\\pi) + \\big( \\beta \\cdot s_{1}(\\tau) \\big) \\pi\n$$\n\nFinally, we combine the numerator and denominator to obtain the expression for $\\eta(\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\eta(\\tau) = \\frac{\\alpha s_{0}(\\tau)(1-\\pi) + \\beta s_{1}(\\tau)\\pi}{s_{0}(\\tau)(1-\\pi) + s_{1}(\\tau)\\pi}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of the Expected Empirical Risk**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the expected empirical $0$-$1$ loss on the augmented dataset. The augmented dataset $D_{aug}$ consists of the original labeled set $D_L$ of size $n_L$ and the set of pseudo-labeled examples $D_{pseudo}$ of size $m$. The total size is $n_L + m$.\n\nThe empirical $0$-$1$ loss on this augmented set for a retrained classifier $h_{new}$ must be evaluated with respect to the *true* labels to quantify the effect of noise. Let $y_i$ be the true label for an instance $x_i$. The true empirical loss is:\n$$\nR_{D_{aug}}^{true}(h_{new}) = \\frac{1}{n_L + m} \\left( \\sum_{(x_i, y_i) \\in D_L} \\mathbb{I}(h_{new}(x_i) \\neq y_i) + \\sum_{(x_j, y_j) \\in D_{pseudo}} \\mathbb{I}(h_{new}(x_j) \\neq y_j) \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the retrained classifier \"perfectly fits the added pseudo labels\". This means that for any pseudo-labeled example $(x_j, \\hat{y}_j) \\in D_{pseudo}$, we have $h_{new}(x_j) = \\hat{y}_j$. Substituting this into the second sum:\n$$\nR_{D_{aug}}^{true}(h_{new}) = \\frac{1}{n_L + m} \\left( \\sum_{(x_i, y_i) \\in D_L} \\mathbb{I}(h_{new}(x_i) \\neq y_i) + \\sum_{(x_j, y_j) \\in D_{pseudo}} \\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_j \\neq y_j) \\right)\n$$\nThe first sum is the total loss on the original labeled set, which is given as $n_L R_L$, where $R_L$ is the labeled empirical loss for $h_{new}$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nR_{D_{aug}}^{true}(h_{new}) = \\frac{n_L R_L + \\sum_{j \\in D_{pseudo}} \\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_j \\neq y_j)}{n_L + m}\n$$\nWe need to find the *expected* empirical loss. The expectation is taken over the random selection of the unlabeled data.\n$$\nE[R_{D_{aug}}^{true}(h_{new})] = \\frac{1}{n_L+m} E\\left[ n_L R_L + \\sum_{j \\in D_{pseudo}} \\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_j \\neq y_j) \\right]\n$$\nAssuming $R_L$ is a fixed outcome of the process, and using the linearity of expectation:\n$$\nE[R_{D_{aug}}^{true}(h_{new})] = \\frac{n_L R_L + E\\left[\\sum_{j \\in D_{pseudo}} \\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_j \\neq y_j)\\right]}{n_L+m}\n$$\nThe sum is over the $m$ selected pseudo-labeled examples. For each such example, indexed by $j$, the term $\\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_j \\neq y_j)$ is a Bernoulli random variable. Its expectation is the probability that its pseudo-label is incorrect. By definition, this is the probability of an incorrect prediction, given that the example was selected, which is precisely $\\eta(\\tau)$.\n$$\nE[\\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_j \\neq y_j)] = \\Pr(\\hat{y} \\neq y \\mid c(X) \\ge \\tau) = \\eta(\\tau)\n$$\nSince this holds for each of the $m$ i.i.d. selected examples, the expectation of the sum is:\n$$\nE\\left[\\sum_{j \\in D_{pseudo}} \\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_j \\neq y_j)\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} E[\\mathbb{I}(\\hat{y}_j \\neq y_j)] = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\eta(\\tau) = m \\eta(\\tau)\n$$\nSubstituting this back, the expected empirical $0$-$1$ loss on the augmented dataset is:\n$$\nE[R_{D_{aug}}^{true}(h_{new})] = \\frac{n_L R_L + m \\eta(\\tau)}{n_L + m}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the resulting effective loss is a weighted average of the loss on the original labeled data, $R_L$, and the noise rate of the pseudo-labels, $\\eta(\\tau)$.\n\nThe problem, however, only asks for the expression for $\\eta(\\tau)$ in the final answer.\n$$\n\\eta(\\tau) = \\frac{\\alpha s_0(\\tau)(1-\\pi) + \\beta s_1(\\tau)\\pi}{(1-\\pi)s_0(\\tau) + \\pi s_1(\\tau)}\n$$\nThis can also be written in a more compact form, but the current form is clear and directly derived.\nFinal check on the expression for final answer:\n$\\eta(\\tau) = \\frac{\\Pr(\\mathrm{error}, \\mathrm{selected})}{\\Pr(\\mathrm{selected})} = \\frac{\\Pr(\\mathrm{error}|y=0)\\Pr(y=0)\\Pr(\\mathrm{selected}|y=0) + \\Pr(\\mathrm{error}|y=1)\\Pr(y=1)\\Pr(\\mathrm{selected}|y=1)}{\\Pr(\\mathrm{selected}|y=0)\\Pr(y=0) + \\Pr(\\mathrm{selected}|y=1)\\Pr(y=1)}$.\nNo, this is wrong. The independence is conditional on $y$. So $\\Pr(\\mathrm{error}, \\mathrm{selected} | y=0) = \\Pr(\\mathrm{error}|y=0)\\Pr(\\mathrm{selected}|y=0)$.\n$\\Pr(\\mathrm{error}, \\mathrm{selected}) = \\Pr(\\mathrm{error}, \\mathrm{selected} | y=0) \\Pr(y=0) + \\Pr(\\mathrm{error}, \\mathrm{selected} | y=1) \\Pr(y=1) = \\Pr(\\mathrm{error} | y=0) \\Pr(\\mathrm{selected} | y=0) \\Pr(y=0) + \\Pr(\\mathrm{error} | y=1) \\Pr(\\mathrm{selected} | y=1) \\Pr(y=1)$.\n$\\Pr(\\mathrm{error}|y=0) = \\Pr(\\hat{y}=1|y=0) = \\alpha$.\n$\\Pr(\\mathrm{error}|y=1) = \\Pr(\\hat{y}=0|y=1) = \\beta$.\nSo the numerator is $\\alpha s_0(\\tau) (1-\\pi) + \\beta s_1(\\tau) \\pi$.\nThe denominator is $s_0(\\tau)(1-\\pi) + s_1(\\tau)\\pi$.\nThe derivation is correct.\nThe final answer is the expression for $\\eta(\\tau)$.",

On the unlabeled sample, assign a pseudo-label $\\hat{Y}(x) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ equal to the Bayes decision with respect to $g(x)$, that is, $\\hat{Y}(x) = \\mathbf{1}\\{g(x) \\geq \\tfrac{1}{2}\\}$. Accept only those pseudo-labels whose confidence margin exceeds a fixed threshold $\\gamma \\in [0, \\tfrac{1}{2})$, meaning the accepted set is $\\{x: |g(x) - \\tfrac{1}{2}| \\geq \\gamma\\}$. Combine the original noisy labeled set with the accepted pseudo-labeled examples, and view the combined set as having an effective label noise rate equal to the fraction of incorrect labels relative to the clean labels $Y$.\n\nStarting from the definitions of symmetric label noise and conditional probabilities, derive the exact affine relationship between $g(x)$ and $\\eta(x)$. Then, using only this relationship and the acceptance rule $|g(x) - \\tfrac{1}{2}| \\geq \\gamma$, compute a distribution-free worst-case upper bound on the pseudo-label error rate among the accepted examples. Using this bound, determine the minimal confidence margin $\\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho)$ such that, for any $\\gamma \\geq \\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho)$ with $\\gamma  \\tfrac{1}{2} - \\rho$, the effective label noise rate after one ST round is strictly lower than the original noise rate $\\rho$, regardless of the distribution of $X$.\n\nYour final answer should be a single closed-form expression for $\\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho)$ in terms of $\\rho$. Do not include any inequalities in the final answer.",
            "solution": "### Derivation\nThe solution proceeds in three stages as required by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Relationship between $g(x)$ and $\\eta(x)$**\n\nThe corrupted posterior $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid X=x)$. Using the law of total probability, we can expand this by conditioning on the clean label $Y$:\n$$g(x) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1, X=x)\\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid X=x) + \\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid Y=0, X=x)\\mathbb{P}(Y=0 \\mid X=x)$$\nThe symmetric noise model states that the label flip probability is independent of the feature $X$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1, X=x) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1) = 1-\\rho$ and $\\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid Y=0, X=x) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{Y}=1 \\mid Y=0) = \\rho$. The clean posteriors are given by $\\eta(x) = \\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid X=x)$ and $1-\\eta(x) = \\mathbb{P}(Y=0 \\mid X=x)$.\nSubstituting these into the equation for $g(x)$:\n$$g(x) = (1-\\rho)\\eta(x) + \\rho(1-\\eta(x))$$\n$$g(x) = (1-\\rho)\\eta(x) + \\rho - \\rho\\eta(x)$$\n$$g(x) = (1-2\\rho)\\eta(x) + \\rho$$\nThis is the affine relationship between the corrupted posterior $g(x)$ and the clean posterior $\\eta(x)$. Since $\\rho \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2})$, the term $1-2\\rho$ is non-zero, and we can invert this relationship to express $\\eta(x)$ in terms of $g(x)$:\n$$\\eta(x) = \\frac{g(x) - \\rho}{1-2\\rho}$$\n\n**2. Worst-Case Pseudo-Label Error Rate**\n\nA pseudo-label $\\hat{Y}(x)$ is assigned based on the Bayes decision rule for the corrupted posterior: $\\hat{Y}(x) = \\mathbf{1}\\{g(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. An example is accepted for self-training if its confidence margin $|g(x) - \\frac{1}{2}|$ is at least $\\gamma$. This acceptance condition partitions the accepted set into two disjoint subsets:\n-   Set 1: $\\{x \\mid g(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} + \\gamma\\}$. For these examples, the pseudo-label is $\\hat{Y}(x) = 1$.\n-   Set 2: $\\{x \\mid g(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{2} - \\gamma\\}$. For these examples, the pseudo-label is $\\hat{Y}(x) = 0$.\n\nThe pseudo-label error rate for a given $x$ is the probability that the pseudo-label $\\hat{Y}(x)$ does not match the true clean label $Y$, i.e., $\\mathbb{P}(\\hat{Y}(x) \\neq Y \\mid X=x)$. Let us find an upper bound for this error rate for any accepted example.\n\nFor an example in Set 1 ($g(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} + \\gamma$ and $\\hat{Y}(x)=1$), an error occurs if the true label is $Y=0$. The probability of this is:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(Y=0 \\mid X=x) = 1 - \\eta(x) = 1 - \\frac{g(x) - \\rho}{1-2\\rho} = \\frac{(1-2\\rho) - (g(x) - \\rho)}{1-2\\rho} = \\frac{1 - \\rho - g(x)}{1-2\\rho}$$\nSince $1-2\\rho  0$, this error probability is a decreasing function of $g(x)$. To find a worst-case (maximum) bound, we must use the minimum possible value of $g(x)$ in this set, which is $g(x) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\gamma$.\n$$\\text{Error Rate (Set 1)} \\leq \\frac{1 - \\rho - (\\frac{1}{2} + \\gamma)}{1-2\\rho} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\rho - \\gamma}{1-2\\rho}$$\n\nFor an example in Set 2 ($g(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{2} - \\gamma$ and $\\hat{Y}(x)=0$), an error occurs if the true label is $Y=1$. The probability of this is:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid X=x) = \\eta(x) = \\frac{g(x) - \\rho}{1-2\\rho}$$\nSince $1-2\\rho  0$, this error probability is an increasing function of $g(x)$. To find a worst-case bound, we must use the maximum possible value of $g(x)$ in this set, which is $g(x) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\gamma$.\n$$\\text{Error Rate (Set 2)} \\leq \\frac{(\\frac{1}{2} - \\gamma) - \\rho}{1-2\\rho} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\rho - \\gamma}{1-2\\rho}$$\nBoth cases yield the same worst-case error bound. This bound is independent of $x$ and the underlying data distribution, as long as the example satisfies the acceptance criterion. Let $\\rho_{\\text{ST}}$ denote the pseudo-label error rate on the accepted set. We have established a distribution-free upper bound:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{ST}} \\leq \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\rho - \\gamma}{1-2\\rho}$$\n\n**3. Minimal Confidence Margin $\\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho)$**\n\nThe problem asks for the condition that ensures the effective label noise rate of the combined dataset is strictly lower than the original noise rate $\\rho$. Let the original noisy labeled set be $S_L$ with size $n_L$, and the set of accepted pseudo-labeled examples be $S_A$ with size $n_A$. The number of errors in $S_L$ is approximately $n_L \\rho$. The number of errors in $S_A$ is $n_A \\rho_{\\text{ST}}$.\nThe effective noise rate, $\\rho_{\\text{eff}}$, is the total number of errors divided by the total size of the combined dataset:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{n_L \\rho + n_A \\rho_{\\text{ST}}}{n_L + n_A}$$\nWe require $\\rho_{\\text{eff}}  \\rho$:\n$$\\frac{n_L \\rho + n_A \\rho_{\\text{ST}}}{n_L + n_A}  \\rho$$\n$$n_L \\rho + n_A \\rho_{\\text{ST}}  n_L \\rho + n_A \\rho$$\nAssuming $n_A > 0$ (i.e., self-training adds some examples), this inequality simplifies to:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{ST}}  \\rho$$\nTo guarantee this condition holds regardless of the data distribution, we must enforce that the worst-case upper bound on $\\rho_{\\text{ST}}$ is strictly less than $\\rho$:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\rho - \\gamma}{1-2\\rho}  \\rho$$\nSince $\\rho \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2})$, we have $1-2\\rho  0$. We can multiply both sides by $1-2\\rho$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} - \\rho - \\gamma  \\rho(1-2\\rho)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} - \\rho - \\gamma  \\rho - 2\\rho^2$$\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} - 2\\rho + 2\\rho^2  \\gamma$$\nThis inequality specifies the condition that $\\gamma$ must satisfy to guarantee a reduction in noise rate. The problem asks for the minimal confidence margin $\\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho)$ such that for any $\\gamma \\geq \\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho)$, this condition holds. This minimal value is the lower bound of the derived interval for $\\gamma$.\nTherefore, the minimal confidence margin is:\n$$\\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{2} - 2\\rho + 2\\rho^2$$\nThis can also be written as $\\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho) = 2(\\rho - \\frac{1}{2})^2$. The problem constraint $\\gamma  \\frac{1}{2} - \\rho$ ensures that $\\gamma_{\\star}(\\rho)$ is a valid choice, as $2(\\rho - \\frac{1}{2})^2  \\frac{1}{2} - \\rho$ for $\\rho \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2})$.",
