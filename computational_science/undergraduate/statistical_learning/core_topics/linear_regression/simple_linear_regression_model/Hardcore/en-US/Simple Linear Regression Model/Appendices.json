            "introduction": "The first step in building a simple linear regression model is to estimate its parameters from data. This practice focuses on calculating the slope, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, which is a critical component as it quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables. Mastering this calculation is fundamental to understanding how a regression line is fitted to a set of observations .",

            "problem": "An IT systems analyst is investigating the relationship between the number of concurrent requests to a web server and its Central Processing Unit (CPU) load. Over a series of observations, the analyst records the number of requests per second ($x$) and the corresponding CPU load ($y$) as a percentage. To model this relationship, the analyst proposes a simple linear regression model of the form $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$.\n\nAfter collecting the data, the analyst computes the following summary statistics, which are essential for determining the least squares regression line:\n- The sum of squared deviations for the number of requests: $S_{xx} = \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = 4.81 \\times 10^4 \\text{ (requests/s)}^2$\n- The sum of the products of deviations for requests and CPU load: $S_{xy} = \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = 2.15 \\times 10^3 \\text{ percent} \\cdot \\text{(requests/s)}$\n\nUsing these summary statistics, calculate the estimated slope ($\\hat{\\beta}_1$) of the regression line. This slope represents the estimated increase in CPU load percentage for each additional request per second. Express your answer in units of percent CPU load per (request/s), rounded to three significant figures.",

            "introduction": "Once a regression model is established, it's crucial to evaluate its performance. A key diagnostic tool is the residual, which measures the difference between an observed value and the value predicted by the model. This exercise demonstrates how to calculate a residual, providing a direct measure of prediction error for a single data point and offering insight into where the model might be inaccurate .",

            "introduction": "While residuals help us assess errors on a point-by-point basis, we also need a single metric to summarize the model's overall explanatory power. This is the role of the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, which represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. This practice will guide you through calculating $R^2$, a cornerstone for interpreting the goodness-of-fit of any linear model .",

            "problem": "An environmental scientist is studying the relationship between the concentration of a specific pollutant in a lake and the population density of a certain species of algae. To quantify this relationship, the scientist collects data from various locations in the lake and fits a simple linear regression model, where pollutant concentration is the explanatory variable and algae density is the response variable.\n\nIn the process of evaluating the model's fit, the scientist calculates two key metrics. The Total Sum of Squares (SST), which represents the total variation in the observed algae population densities, is calculated to be 150.0 (in units of thousands of cells per milliliter, squared). The Sum of Squares due to Regression (SSR), which measures the variation in algae density that is explained by the linear relationship with the pollutant concentration, is found to be 120.0 in the same units.\n\nCalculate the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, for this regression model. Express your answer as a decimal value.",
