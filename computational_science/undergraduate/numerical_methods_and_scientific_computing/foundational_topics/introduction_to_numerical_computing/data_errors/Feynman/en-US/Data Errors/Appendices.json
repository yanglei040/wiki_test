            "introduction": "Our journey into hands-on practice begins with a foundational concept: error propagation. In scientific computing, we often use approximations of mathematical constants like $\\pi$. This exercise demonstrates how a seemingly small truncation error in an input value can propagate through a formula, leading to a significant error in the final result, especially as other parameters in the calculation become large. By analyzing the volume of a sphere, you will derive an exact expression for this error, providing a clear and tangible understanding of forward error analysis .",

Consider the volume of a sphere of radius $R$, where $R$ is a positive real number and is known exactly. The true volume is determined by a well-tested geometric formula. In practice, suppose the constant $\\pi$ is truncated to the decimal value $3.14$ before computing the sphere's volume. Using the foundational definition of forward (output) error as the difference between the computed quantity and the true quantity, and using only well-established geometric facts, derive the exact closed-form expression for the signed absolute error in the computed volume due solely to truncating $\\pi$ to $3.14$. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $R$. No rounding is required.",

Let $x_i = \\frac{1}{i} + \\delta_i$ where $i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$ and $\\delta_i$ is small additive data noise.

            "solution": "The core of this problem lies in understanding how floating-point arithmetic deviates from exact real arithmetic, particularly in the context of summing a long sequence of numbers.\n\nA standard floating-point addition operation is modeled by $\\operatorname{fl}(a + b) = (a + b)(1 + \\theta)$, where $|\\theta| \\leq u$. The term $u$ is the unit roundoff, which is $u = 2^{-53}$ for IEEE 754 double precision. Each addition can introduce a small relative error. When summing $n$ numbers, $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$, a naive sequential summation computes $s_1 = x_1$, $s_2 = \\operatorname{fl}(s_1 + x_2)$, $s_3 = \\operatorname{fl}(s_2 + x_3)$, and so on. The errors from each step accumulate.\n\nA well-known issue arises when adding numbers of vastly different magnitudes. If we add a small number to a large one, i.e., $|x_i| \\ll |s_{i-1}|$, the smaller number may be partially or completely lost due to rounding. For the sequence $x_i = \\frac{1}{i}$, the terms are strictly decreasing in magnitude: $x_1 > x_2 > \\dots > x_n$.\n\n- **Naive Ascending Summation ($S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\uparrow}$):** This involves summing from $i=1$ to $n$. We start with the largest term, $x_1=1$, and successively add smaller and smaller terms. As the running sum $s_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i$ grows, the newly added terms $x_{k+1}$ become increasingly smaller relative to $s_k$. This leads to significant loss of precision, a phenomenon known as absorption error.\n\n- **Naive Descending Summation ($S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\downarrow}$):** This involves summing from $i=n$ to $1$. We start with the smallest terms and gradually add larger ones. The running sum grows more slowly, and consecutive terms added are of more similar magnitude. This strategy generally reduces the accumulation of rounding error. Thus, we expect $S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\downarrow}$ to be more accurate than $S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\uparrow}$. The difference $d_{\\text{naive}} = |S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\uparrow} - S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\downarrow}|$ is expected to be significant for large $n$.\n\nTo mitigate the accumulation of rounding errors, numerically stable algorithms have been developed. The problem specifies using a compensated summation method, for which the Kahan Summation Algorithm is the canonical choice. It cleverly tracks the roundoff error from each addition and incorporates it into the subsequent step.\n\nThe algorithm to compute $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize sum $s = 0.0$ and a compensation variable $c = 0.0$.\n2. For $i=1$ to $n$:\n   a. $y = x_i - c$  (Subtract the error from the previous step)\n   b. $t = s + y$    (Add the corrected term to the sum)\n   c. $c = (t - s) - y$  (The new error is the part of $y$ that was lost when adding to $s$)\n   d. $s = t$          (Update the sum)\n3. The final result is $s$.\n\nThe key is step $2c$. In exact arithmetic, $c$ would be $0$. In floating-point arithmetic, $(t - s)$ is the part of $y$ that was actually assimilated into $s$. Subtracting $y$ from this value gives the negative of the part of $y$ that was lost. This \"lost low-part\" is then subtracted from the next term $x_{i+1}$ in step $2a$ of the next iteration, effectively carrying it forward to be included in the sum.\n\nThe error of Kahan summation is bounded by approximately $(2u + O(nu^2))\\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|$. The first-order term is independent of $n$, making the algorithm extremely accurate even for very large sums. As a result, both ascending ($S_{\\text{comp}}^{\\uparrow}$) and descending ($S_{\\text{comp}}^{\\downarrow}$) compensated sums should be very close to the true mathematical sum, and thus very close to each other. We expect their difference, $d_{\\text{comp}} = |S_{\\text{comp}}^{\\uparrow} - S_{\\text{comp}}^{\\downarrow}|$, to be close to zero.\n\nThe compensated sum serves as a high-accuracy benchmark. Therefore, the metrics $I_{\\uparrow} = |S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\uparrow} - S_{\\text{comp}}^{\\uparrow}|$ and $I_{\\downarrow} = |S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\downarrow} - S_{\\text{comp}}^{\\downarrow}|$ effectively measure the absolute error of the naive ascending and descending summations, respectively. We expect $I_{\\uparrow} > I_{\\downarrow}$ for large $n$.\n\nCase D introduces additive data noise $\\delta_i$ sampled from a normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 10^{-12}$. The unit roundoff $u$ is approximately $2.22 \\times 10^{-16}$. Since $\\sigma \\gg u$, the data noise is significantly larger than the rounding error of a single operation. The sum of these noise terms, $\\sum \\delta_i$, will contribute an error to the total sum. The standard deviation of this total noise error is $\\sqrt{n}\\sigma$. For $n=10^5$, this is $\\sqrt{10^5} \\times 10^{-12} \\approx 3.16 \\times 10^{-10}$.\n\nKahan summation accurately sums the given noisy data $x_i = 1/i + \\delta_i$. The difference between ascending and descending Kahan sums should remain negligible. Naive summation, however, will be afflicted by both its inherent rounding error accumulation and the data noise. The metrics $I_{\\uparrow}$ and $I_{\\downarrow}$ will still primarily reflect the large rounding errors of the naive methods, as these errors for $n=10^5$ are expected to be much larger than the total data error.\n\nThe algorithmic implementation follows these steps:\n- For each test case $(n, \\sigma)$:\n  1. Generate the vector of terms $x_i = \\frac{1}{i} + \\delta_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$. A new pseudorandom number generator seeded with $0$ is used for each case to generate the noise vector $\\delta$ of length $n$. For cases with $\\sigma = 0$, $\\delta_i = 0$. All computations use double precision (`np.float64`).\n  2. Create two versions of the data vector: one in ascending order of $i$ and one in descending order.\n  3. Implement two summation functions: `naive_sum` (a simple loop accumulator) and `kahan_sum` (implementing the algorithm described above).\n  4. Compute the four sums: $S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\uparrow}$, $S_{\\text{naive}}^{\\downarrow}$, $S_{\\text{comp}}^{\\uparrow}$, and $S_{\\text{comp}}^{\\downarrow}$ by applying the appropriate function to the appropriate data vector.\n  5. Calculate the four required metrics ($d_{\\text{naive}}, d_{\\text{comp}}, I_{\\uparrow}, I_{\\downarrow}$) from these sums.\n  6. Store and format the results as specified.",

            "solution": "The problem asks to compare the stability of three finite difference formulas (forward, backward, central) when applied to data contaminated with high-frequency noise. Stability is defined by how much the operator amplifies the noise. The analysis is to be performed at the highest resolvable frequency on the grid, the Nyquist frequency, where the wavenumber $k$ and grid spacing $h$ satisfy $k h = \\pi$.\n\nThe noise component at a grid point $x_i$ is $n(x_i) = \\epsilon \\cos(k x_i)$.
