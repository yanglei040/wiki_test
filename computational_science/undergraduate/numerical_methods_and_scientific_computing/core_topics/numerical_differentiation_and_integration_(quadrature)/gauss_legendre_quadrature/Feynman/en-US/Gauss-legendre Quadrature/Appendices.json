            "introduction": "Gauss-Legendre quadrature is prized for its remarkable efficiency, which stems from a property called the degree of exactness. Unlike other methods that might require many points to accurately integrate a simple polynomial, an $n$-point Gauss-Legendre rule is exact for all polynomials of degree up to $2n-1$. This practice  provides a direct demonstration of this principle, showing how a simple two-point rule can perfectly evaluate a cubic polynomial, a feat that is not a coincidence but a direct consequence of its design.",

The quadrature result is only an approximation that happens to be exact for this specific polynomial purely by coincidence.\n\nE. The quadrature result is not exact, and the difference between $I_{GQ}$ and $I$ represents the approximation error.\n\nYour task is to provide two results: the value of the approximation $I_{GQ}$ expressed as an exact fraction, and the capital letter corresponding to the single correct statement from the list above.",
