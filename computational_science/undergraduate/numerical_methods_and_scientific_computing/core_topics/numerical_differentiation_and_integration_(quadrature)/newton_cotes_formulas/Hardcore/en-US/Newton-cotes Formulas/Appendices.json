            "introduction": "This final practice bridges theory and computation to reveal a deeper connection between different Newton-Cotes formulas. You will demonstrate through implementation that the composite Simpson's rule is not an isolated method but can be derived by applying Richardson extrapolation to results from the composite trapezoidal rule.

            "problem": "You are to write a complete, runnable program that, for a collection of test cases, numerically verifies that applying Richardson extrapolation to the composite trapezoidal rule on a uniform mesh with $N$ subintervals and with $2N$ subintervals yields exactly the same numerical value as the composite Simpson's rule with $2N$ subintervals. Your implementation and reasoning must be grounded in standard definitions of Newton-Cotes formulas (composite trapezoidal rule and composite Simpson's rule) and the asymptotic error expansion provided by the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula. You must not assume any specialized or problem-specific results beyond these fundamentals. All angles, where applicable, must be interpreted in radians.\n\nTasks to implement in code:\n- Given a function $f$, interval $[a,b]$, and an even integer $M$, implement the composite Simpson's rule with $M$ uniform subintervals of width $h_M = (b-a)/M$.\n- Given a function $f$, interval $[a,b]$, and a positive integer $N$, implement the composite trapezoidal rule with $N$ uniform subintervals of width $h_N = (b-a)/N$.\n- Construct a Richardson-extrapolated estimate from the two composite trapezoidal approximations computed on meshes with $N$ and $2N$ subintervals by canceling the leading-order error term in the asymptotic expansion. Use these two values to form a single extrapolated estimate.\n- For each test case below, compare the Richardson-extrapolated value to the composite Simpson's value computed on the mesh with $2N$ subintervals, and return a boolean indicating whether their absolute difference is less than or equal to a tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-12}$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ on $[a,b] = [0,\\pi]$, with $N = 10$.

The program must run as-is and apply the above test suite internally.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the cases listed above. For example, the output must have the form $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4]$ where each $r_i$ is a boolean.\n\nNotes:\n- All computations must be performed in floating-point arithmetic in a stable and efficient manner.\n- Ensure that $M = 2N$ is even for Simpson's rule. No other assumptions are required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a numerical verification of a fundamental identity in numerical integration: that the first-order Richardson extrapolation applied to the composite trapezoidal rule yields the composite Simpson's rule. We will first establish this identity theoretically and then implement a program to verify it for a given set of test cases.\n\n**Theoretical Foundation**\n\nLet $I = \\int_a^b f(x) dx$ be the exact value of the definite integral of a sufficiently smooth function $f(x)$ over the interval $[a,b]$.\n\n**1. Composite Trapezoidal Rule and its Error Expansion**\n\nThe composite trapezoidal rule, denoted by $T_N$, approximates $I$ using $N$ subintervals of equal width $h = (b-a)/N$. Its formula is:\n$$ T_N = \\frac{h}{2} \\left( f(x_0) + 2\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f(x_i) + f(x_N) \\right) $$\nwhere $x_i = a + i h$.\n\nThe Euler–Maclaurin summation formula provides an asymptotic expansion for the error of the trapezoidal rule. When applied to $T_N$, which we can write as $T(h)$, the expansion is:\n$$ T(h) = I + C_1 h^2 + C_2 h^4 + C_3 h^6 + \\dots $$\nThe coefficients $C_k$ are independent of $h$ and depend on the derivatives of $f(x)$ at the endpoints $a$ and $b$. The leading error term is of order $O(h^2)$.\n\n**2. Richardson Extrapolation**\n\nThe goal of Richardson extrapolation is to combine two approximations with different step sizes to obtain a more accurate estimate by canceling the leading error term. Let's compute the integral using two different numbers of subintervals: $N$ and $2N$. The respective step sizes are $h = (b-a)/N$ and $h/2 = (b-a)/(2N)$. Let $T_N = T(h)$ and $T_{2N} = T(h/2)$. Their error expansions are:\n$$ T_N = I + C_1 h^2 + C_2 h^4 + O(h^6) $$\n$$ T_{2N} = I + C_1 \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^4 + O(h^6) = I + \\frac{1}{4} C_1 h^2 + \\frac{1}{16} C_2 h^4 + O(h^6) $$\nWe have a system of two linear equations in terms of the unknowns $I$ and $C_1 h^2$. To eliminate the $C_1 h^2$ term, we compute $4T_{2N} - T_N$:\n$$ 4T_{2N} - T_N = \\left( 4I + C_1 h^2 + \\frac{1}{4} C_2 h^4 \\right) - \\left( I + C_1 h^2 + C_2 h^4 \\right) + O(h^6) = 3I - \\frac{3}{4} C_2 h^4 + O(h^6) $$\nSolving for $I$ gives the extrapolated approximation, which we denote as $R_N$:\n$$ R_N = \\frac{4T_{2N} - T_N}{3} = I - \\frac{1}{4} C_2 h^4 + O(h^6) $$\nThis new approximation $R_N$ has an error of order $O(h^4)$, a significant improvement over the $O(h^2)$ error of the trapezoidal rule.\n\n**3. Composite Simpson's Rule**\n\nThe composite Simpson's rule requires an even number of subintervals. Let's consider $M = 2N$ subintervals. The step size is $h' = (b-a)/M = (b-a)/(2N)$. This is the same step size used for $T_{2N}$. Let the nodes be $x_i = a + i h'$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, 2N$. The formula for the composite Simpson's rule, denoted $S_{2N}$, is:\n$$ S_{2N} = \\frac{h'}{3} \\left( f(x_0) + 4\\sum_{j=1}^{N} f(x_{2j-1}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) + f(x_{2N}) \\right) $$\nThe error of composite Simpson's rule is known to be of order $O((h')^4)$.\n\n**4. The Identity: $R_N = S_{2N}$**\n\nWe now show that the Richardson-extrapolated value $R_N$ is algebraically identical to the composite Simpson's rule value $S_{2N}$. We use the common set of nodes, $x_i = a + i h'$, where $h' = (b-a)/(2N)$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2N\\}$.\n\nThe approximation $T_{2N}$ uses all $2N+1$ nodes:\n$$ T_{2N} = \\frac{h'}{2} \\left( f(x_0) + 2\\sum_{i=1}^{2N-1} f(x_i) + f(x_{2N}) \\right) $$\nThe approximation $T_N$ uses a step size of $h=2h'$. Its nodes are the evenly indexed nodes from the finer grid: $x_0, x_2, \\dots, x_{2N}$.\n$$ T_N = \\frac{2h'}{2} \\left( f(x_0) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) + f(x_{2N}) \\right) = h' \\left( f(x_0) + f(x_{2N}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the formula for $R_N = \\frac{4T_{2N} - T_N}{3}$.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n4T_{2N} - T_N &= 4 \\left( \\frac{h'}{2} \\left[ f(x_0) + f(x_{2N}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N} f(x_{2j-1}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) \\right] \\right) \\\\\n& \\quad - h' \\left[ f(x_0) + f(x_{2N}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) \\right] \\\\\n&= h' \\left[ 2(f(x_0) + f(x_{2N})) + 4\\sum_{j=1}^{N} f(x_{2j-1}) + 4\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) \\right] \\\\\n& \\quad - h' \\left[ f(x_0) + f(x_{2N}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) \\right] \\\\\n&= h' \\left[ (f(x_0) + f(x_{2N})) + 4\\sum_{j=1}^{N} f(x_{2j-1}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nDividing by $3$ yields:\n$$ R_N = \\frac{4T_{2N} - T_N}{3} = \\frac{h'}{3} \\left[ f(x_0) + f(x_{2N}) + 4\\sum_{j=1}^{N} f(x_{2j-1}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{2j}) \\right] $$\nThis is precisely the formula for the composite Simpson's rule, $S_{2N}$. Thus, the identity $R_N \\equiv S_{2N}$ is established.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe derivation confirms that, in exact arithmetic, applying Richardson extrapolation to the composite trapezoidal rule approximations $T_N$ and $T_{2N}$ is mathematically equivalent to applying the composite Simpson's rule $S_{2N}$. The program will implement these formulas in floating-point arithmetic and verify that the computed values are equal within a small tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-12}$, which accounts for potential minor discrepancies due to the order of floating-point operations. For all test cases, the result is expected to be True.",
