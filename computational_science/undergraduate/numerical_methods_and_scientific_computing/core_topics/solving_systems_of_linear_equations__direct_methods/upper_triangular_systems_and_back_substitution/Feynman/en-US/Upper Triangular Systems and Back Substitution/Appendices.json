            "solution": "### Exact Arithmetic Solution\nUsing exact real arithmetic, we perform back substitution on the system $Ux=b$:\n1. $x_4 = b_4 / u_{44} = 1/1 = 1$.\n2. $x_3 = (b_3 - u_{34}x_4)/u_{33} = ((10^8 + 1) - 10^8(1))/1 = 1$.\n3. $x_2 = (b_2 - u_{23}x_3 - u_{24}x_4)/u_{22} = ((2\\times 10^8 + 1) - 10^8(1) - 10^8(1))/1 = 1$.\n4. $x_1 = (b_1 - u_{12}x_2 - u_{13}x_3 - u_{14}x_4)/u_{11} = ((3\\times 10^8 + 10^{-8}) - 10^8(1) - 10^8(1) - 10^8(1))/10^{-8} = (10^{-8}) / 10^{-8} = 1$.\n\nThe exact solution is $\\mathbf{x} = (1, 1, 1, 1)^T$. The computation of $x_1$ involves the subtraction of two large, nearly equal numbers: $(3 \\times 10^8 + 10^{-8}) - 3 \\times 10^8$. This phenomenon, known as **catastrophic cancellation**, makes the calculation extremely sensitive to rounding errors. This sensitivity is further amplified by division by the very small diagonal element $u_{11} = 10^{-8}$.\n\n### IEEE 754 Single Precision Solution\nIn IEEE 754 single precision (binary32), numbers have about 7-8 decimal digits of precision. The outcome is dominated by rounding errors that occur before and during the computation.\n\n**1. Initial Rounding of `b`:**\nThe right-hand side vector $b$ must first be stored as single-precision values.\n- For $b_3 = 10^8 + 1$: The unit in the last place (ulp) for numbers of magnitude $10^8$ is $2^{\\lfloor\\log_2(10^8)\\rfloor - 23} = 2^{26-23} = 2^3 = 8$. Since the increment `1` is less than half an ulp, $10^8+1$ rounds to $10^8$. So, $\\text{fl}(b_3) = 10^8$.\n- For $b_2 = 2 \\times 10^8 + 1$: The ulp for numbers of magnitude $2 \\times 10^8$ is $2^{\\lfloor\\log_2(2\\times 10^8)\\rfloor - 23} = 2^{27-23} = 2^4 = 16$. The increment `1` is less than half an ulp, so $\\text{fl}(b_2) = 2 \\times 10^8$.\n- For $b_1 = 3 \\times 10^8 + 10^{-8}$: The ulp for numbers of magnitude $3 \\times 10^8$ is $2^5=32$. The increment $10^{-8}$ is negligible, so $\\text{fl}(b_1) = 3 \\times 10^8$.\n\nThe system effectively being solved in floating-point arithmetic is $Ux_f = b_f$, where $b_f = (3\\times 10^8, 2\\times 10^8, 10^8, 1)^T$.\n\n**2. Floating-Point Back Substitution:**\nLet $\\oplus, \\ominus, \\otimes, \\oslash$ denote floating-point operations.\n- $x_{f,4} = 1 \\oslash 1 = 1$.\n- $x_{f,3} = (\\text{fl}(b_3) \\ominus u_{34} \\otimes x_{f,4}) \\oslash 1 = (10^8 \\ominus 10^8 \\otimes 1) = 0$. The initial rounding of $b_3$ causes the computed $x_{f,3}$ to be zero instead of one.\n- $x_{f,2} = (\\text{fl}(b_2) \\ominus (u_{23} \\otimes x_{f,3} \\oplus u_{24} \\otimes x_{f,4})) \\oslash 1 = (2\\times 10^8 \\ominus (10^8 \\otimes 0 \\oplus 10^8 \\otimes 1)) = 2\\times 10^8 \\ominus 10^8 = 10^8$. The error from $x_{f,3}$ propagates, causing $x_{f,2}$ to be $10^8$ instead of one.\n- $x_{f,1} = (\\text{fl}(b_1) \\ominus (u_{12} \\otimes x_{f,2} \\oplus u_{13} \\otimes x_{f,3} \\oplus u_{14} \\otimes x_{f,4})) \\oslash u_{11}$.\n  - The sum inside the parenthesis is $S_f = 10^8 \\otimes 10^8 \\oplus 10^8 \\otimes 0 \\oplus 10^8 \\otimes 1 = \\text{fl}(10^{16}) \\oplus 10^8$.\n  - The ulp of numbers with magnitude $10^{16}$ is approximately $10^9$. Since $10^8$ is smaller than half of this ulp, it is lost in the addition due to **swamping**. So, $S_f = \\text{fl}(10^{16})$.\n  - The numerator becomes $N_f = \\text{fl}(b_1) \\ominus S_f = 3\\times 10^8 \\ominus \\text{fl}(10^{16})$. Again, due to swamping, this results in $N_f = -\\text{fl}(10^{16})$.\n  - Finally, $x_{f,1} = (-\\text{fl}(10^{16})) \\oslash \\text{fl}(10^{-8}) \\approx -10^{16} / 10^{-8} = -10^{24}$.\n\nThe computed value for $x_1$ in single precision is approximately $-1.000 \\times 10^{24}$, a result that is dramatically different from the true solution of $1$.",

This structure can be exploited by representing $A$ as a rank-1 update to an upper triangular matrix.\n\nLet $U$ be the upper triangular matrix obtained by setting the $(n,1)$ entry of $A$ to zero. Let $\\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\\mathbf{e}_n$ be the standard basis vectors. Then we can write $A$ as:\n$$A = U + A_{n1} \\mathbf{e}_n \\mathbf{e}_1^T$$\nThe linear system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ becomes:\n$$(U + A_{n1} \\mathbf{e}_n \\mathbf{e}_1^T)\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$$\nUsing the fact that $\\mathbf{e}_1^T \\mathbf{x} = x_1$, we have:\n$$U\\mathbf{x} + A_{n1}x_1 \\mathbf{e}_n = \\mathbf{b}$$\n$$U\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b} - A_{n1}x_1 \\mathbf{e}_n$$\nAssuming $U$ is invertible, we can solve for $\\mathbf{x}$:\n$$\\mathbf{x} = U^{-1}(\\mathbf{b} - A_{n1}x_1 \\mathbf{e}_n) = U^{-1}\\mathbf{b} - A_{n1}x_1 (U^{-1}\\mathbf{e}_n)$$\nThis equation expresses the solution $\\mathbf{x}$ in terms of the unknown scalar $x_1$ and two vectors that can be computed efficiently. Let's define:\n1. $\\mathbf{y} = U^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$, which is the solution to the upper triangular system $U\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{b}$.\n2. $\\mathbf{z} = U^{-1}\\mathbf{e}_n$, which is the solution to the upper triangular system $U\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{e}_n$.\n\nBoth $\\mathbf{y}$ and $\\mathbf{z}$ can be found using back substitution. The solution $\\mathbf{x}$ is then:\n$$\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y} - A_{n1}x_1 \\mathbf{z}$$\nTo find the unknown $x_1$, we extract the first component of this vector equation:\n$$x_1 = y_1 - A_{n1}x_1 z_1$$\nSolving this linear equation for $x_1$ gives:\n$$x_1(1 + A_{n1}z_1) = y_1 \\implies x_1 = \\frac{y_1}{1 + A_{n1}z_1}$$\nThis method requires solving two upper triangular systems (each $O(n^2)$) and performing a few scalar operations, yielding an efficient $O(n^2)$ algorithm.\n\n### Application to the Specific System\nFor the given $5 \\times 5$ system, we have $n=5$, $A_{51} = -3$, and the upper triangular matrix $U$ is:\n$$\nU =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3  -1  2  0  1 \\\\\n0  2  1  -1  3 \\\\\n0  0  4  -2  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  5  2 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n**1.

Let's recheck this calculation carefully.\n$3z_1 = z_2 - 2z_3 - z_5 = -59/240 - 2(-3/40) - 1/6 = -59/240 + 6/40 - 1/6 = (-59 + 36 - 40)/240 = -63/240 = -21/80$.\nSo, $z_1 = -7/80$.\n\n**3. Compute $x_1$:**\nUsing the derived formula with $A_{51} = -3$, $y_1 = 26/15$, and $z_1 = -7/80$:\n$$x_1 = \\frac{y_1}{1 + A_{51}z_1} = \\frac{26/15}{1 + (-3)(-7/80)} = \\frac{26/15}{1 + 21/80} = \\frac{26/15}{(80+21)/80} = \\frac{26/15}{101/80}$$\n$$x_1 = \\frac{26}{15} \\cdot \\frac{80}{101} = \\frac{26}{3 \\cdot 5} \\cdot \\frac{16 \\cdot 5}{101} = \\frac{26 \\cdot 16}{3 \\cdot 101} = \\frac{416}{303}$$",
