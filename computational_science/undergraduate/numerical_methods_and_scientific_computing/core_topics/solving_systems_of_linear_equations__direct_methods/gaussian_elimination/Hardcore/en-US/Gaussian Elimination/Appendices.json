            "introduction": "While the theory of Gaussian elimination is straightforward, its practical application can present challenges. One common issue arises when a zero appears in a pivot position, an element you need to divide by, which would halt the naive algorithm. This practice problem demonstrates the essential technique of partial pivoting—strategically swapping rows—to navigate around this obstacle and successfully find the system's unique solution . Mastering pivoting is a key step toward writing robust numerical solvers.",

Solving by first principles, we may apply elementary row operations to the augmented matrix to reach an upper-triangular form and then perform back substitution. A leading pivot of $0$ at position $(1,1)$ in $A$ prevents division in the first step if rows are kept in the present order. An allowed elementary operation is to interchange equations (row swap), which does not change the solution set.\n\nForm the augmented matrix and perform a row swap to place a nonzero entry in the $(1,1)$ position:\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n0 & 2 & 1 & 1\\\\\n3 & 6 & 9 & 27\\\\\n1 & -1 & 2 & 9\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{swap row } 1 \\leftrightarrow 2}\\;\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n3 & 6 & 9 & 27\\\\\n0 & 2 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & -1 & 2 & 9\n\\end{array}\n\\right].\n$$\nUse the pivot $3$ in the first row to eliminate the entry below it in column $1$.
