This practice problem  presents exactly such a scenario.

Solving by first principles, we may apply elementary row operations to the augmented matrix to reach an upper-triangular form and then perform back substitution. A leading pivot of $0$ at position $(1,1)$ in $A$ prevents division in the first step if rows are kept in the present order. An allowed elementary operation is to interchange equations (row swap), which does not change the solution set.\n\nForm the augmented matrix and perform a row swap to place a nonzero entry in the $(1,1)$ position:\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n0 & 2 & 1 & 1\\\\\n3 & 6 & 9 & 27\\\\\n1 & -1 & 2 & 9\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\;\\xrightarrow{\\text{swap row } 1 \\leftrightarrow 2}\\;\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n3 & 6 & 9 & 27\\\\\n0 & 2 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & -1 & 2 & 9\n\\end{array}\n\\right].\n$$\nUse the pivot $3$ in the first row to eliminate the entry below it in column $1$.
