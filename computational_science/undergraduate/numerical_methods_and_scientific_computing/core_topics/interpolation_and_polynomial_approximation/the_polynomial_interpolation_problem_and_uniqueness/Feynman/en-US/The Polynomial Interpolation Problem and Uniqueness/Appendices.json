            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed problem in numerical analysis concerning polynomial interpolation, grounded in established mathematical principles and containing all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to find the unique interpolating polynomial $p(x)$ of degree at most $3$ for the function $f(x) = \\cos(\\pi x)$ at the distinct integer nodes $x_0 = 0$, $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 2$, and $x_3 = 3$. We will construct this polynomial in its Newton form and then simplify it to the standard monomial basis.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the function $f(x)$ at the given nodes:\n$f(x_0) = f(0) = \\cos(0 \\cdot \\pi) = \\cos(0) = 1$\n$f(x_1) = f(1) = \\cos(1 \\cdot \\pi) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$\n$f(x_2) = f(2) = \\cos(2 \\cdot \\pi) = \\cos(2\\pi) = 1$\n$f(x_3) = f(3) = \\cos(3 \\cdot \\pi) = \\cos(3\\pi) = -1$\n\nThe Newton form of the interpolating polynomial $p(x)$ for $n+1 = 4$ points is given by:\n$$p(x) = f[x_0] + f[x_0, x_1](x - x_0) + f[x_0, x_1, x_2](x - x_0)(x - x_1) + f[x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3](x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_2)$$\nwhere $f[\\dots]$ are the divided differences. We must construct these coefficients recursively, starting from the zeroth-order differences, which are the function values themselves.\n\nThe zeroth-order divided differences are:\n$f[x_0] = f(0) = 1$\n$f[x_1] = f(1) = -1$\n$f[x_2] = f(2) = 1$\n$f[x_3] = f(3) = -1$\n\nThe first-order divided differences are calculated as:\n$f[x_0, x_1] = \\frac{f[x_1] - f[x_0]}{x_1 - x_0} = \\frac{-1 - 1}{1 - 0} = -2$\n$f[x_1, x_2] = \\frac{f[x_2] - f[x_1]}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{1 - (-1)}{2 - 1} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$\n$f[x_2, x_3] = \\frac{f[x_3] - f[x_2]}{x_3 - x_2} = \\frac{-1 - 1}{3 - 2} = \\frac{-2}{1} = -2$\n\nThe second-order divided differences are:\n$f[x_0, x_1, x_2] = \\frac{f[x_1, x_2] - f[x_0, x_1]}{x_2 - x_0} = \\frac{2 - (-2)}{2 - 0} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$\n$f[x_1, x_2, x_3] = \\frac{f[x_2, x_3] - f[x_1, x_2]}{x_3 - x_1} = \\frac{-2 - 2}{3 - 1} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2$\n\nFinally, the third-order divided difference is:\n$f[x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3] = \\frac{f[x_1, x_2, x_3] - f[x_0, x_1, x_2]}{x_3 - x_0} = \\frac{-2 - 2}{3 - 0} = -\\frac{4}{3}$\n\nThe required coefficients for the Newton form are the top diagonal of the divided difference table: $f[x_0]=1$, $f[x_0, x_1]=-2$, $f[x_0, x_1, x_2]=2$, and $f[x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3]=-\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSubstituting these values and the nodes ($x_0=0, x_1=1, x_2=2$) into the Newton polynomial formula:\n$$p(x) = 1 + (-2)(x - 0) + 2(x - 0)(x - 1) + \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)(x - 0)(x - 1)(x - 2)$$\n$$p(x) = 1 - 2x + 2x(x - 1) - \\frac{4}{3}x(x - 1)(x - 2)$$\n\nNow, we expand and simplify this expression to obtain the polynomial in the standard monomial basis $\\{1, x, x^2, x^3\\}$.\nFirst, expand the products of binomials:\n$x(x - 1) = x^2 - x$\n$x(x - 1)(x - 2) = x(x^2 - 3x + 2) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x$\n\nSubstitute these back into the expression for $p(x)$:\n$p(x) = 1 - 2x + 2(x^2 - x) - \\frac{4}{3}(x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x)$\n$p(x) = 1 - 2x + 2x^2 - 2x - \\frac{4}{3}x^3 + \\frac{12}{3}x^2 - \\frac{8}{3}x$\n$p(x) = 1 - 2x + 2x^2 - 2x - \\frac{4}{3}x^3 + 4x^2 - \\frac{8}{3}x$\n\nFinally, collect terms by powers of $x$:\nThe $x^3$ term is: $-\\frac{4}{3}x^3$\nThe $x^2$ term is: $2x^2 + 4x^2 = 6x^2$\nThe $x$ term is: $-2x - 2x - \\frac{8}{3}x = -4x - \\frac{8}{3}x = \\left(-\\frac{12}{3} - \\frac{8}{3}\\right)x = -\\frac{20}{3}x$\nThe constant term is: $1$\n\nCombining these terms, the simplified polynomial is:\n$$p(x) = -\\frac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 - \\frac{20}{3}x + 1$$\n\nTo justify the uniqueness of this polynomial, we invoke the fundamental theorem of polynomial interpolation, which was stated in the problem. The polynomial $p(x)$ we constructed has degree $3$, which is \"at most $3$\". By its construction, it satisfies the interpolation conditions $p(x_i) = f(x_i)$ at the $n+1=4$ distinct points $x_0=0, x_1=1, x_2=2, x_3=3$.\nSuppose there existed another polynomial, say $q(x)$, also of degree at most $3$, that satisfied the same conditions, i.e., $q(x_i) = f(x_i)$ for $i=0, 1, 2, 3$. Then, the two polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ would have the same values at $4$ distinct points. According to the principle that \"if two polynomials of degree at most $n$ agree at $n+1$ distinct points, then they are identical\", it follows that $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ must be the same polynomial. Therefore, the polynomial $p(x) = -\\frac{4}{3}x^3 + 6x^2 - \\frac{20}{3}x + 1$ is the unique interpolating polynomial of degree at most $3$ for the given data.",

It is a standard problem in numerical analysis concerning the recursive construction of interpolating polynomials, often leading to the Newton form.

This means $p_{n+1}(x_{k}) = f(x_{k})$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n+1\\}$.\n\nWe are tasked with finding an expression for $p_{n+1}(x)$ in terms of $p_{n}(x)$. Consider the difference polynomial $q(x)$ defined as:\n$$q(x) = p_{n+1}(x) - p_{n}(x)$$\n\nThe degree of $p_{n+1}(x)$ is at most $n+1$, and the degree of $p_{n}(x)$ is at most $n$. Therefore, the degree of their difference, $q(x)$, is at most $n+1$.\n\nLet us evaluate $q(x)$ at the original interpolation nodes $x_{k}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nFrom the definitions of the interpolating polynomials, we have:\n$p_{n+1}(x_{k}) = f(x_{k})$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$\n$p_{n}(x_{k}) = f(x_{k})$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$\n\nTherefore, for each $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, the value of $q(x_k)$ is:\n$$q(x_{k}) = p_{n+1}(x_{k}) - p_{n}(x_{k}) = f(x_{k}) - f(x_{k}) = 0$$\n\nThis shows that the polynomial $q(x)$ has $n+1$ distinct roots: $x_{0}, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}$.\nAccording to the Factor Theorem from algebra, if a polynomial has a root at a value $a$, then $(x-a)$ must be a factor of that polynomial. Since $q(x)$ has roots at each of the $n+1$ distinct nodes $x_0, \\dots, x_n$, it must be divisible by the product of the corresponding factors.\nThus, $q(x)$ can be written in the form:\n$$q(x) = C \\cdot (x-x_{0})(x-x_{1})\\cdots(x-x_{n})$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. We can express this more compactly as:\n$$q(x) = C \\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x-x_{k})$$\n\nNow, we can express $p_{n+1}(x)$ by substituting this form of $q(x)$ back into its definition:\n$$p_{n+1}(x) = p_{n}(x) + q(x) = p_{n}(x) + C \\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x-x_{k})$$\n\nTo determine the constant $C$, we use the one remaining piece of information: the interpolation condition for $p_{n+1}(x)$ at the new node $x_{n+1}$. We know that $p_{n+1}(x_{n+1}) = f(x_{n+1})$.\nLet us evaluate the expression for $p_{n+1}(x)$ at $x = x_{n+1}$:\n$$p_{n+1}(x_{n+1}) = p_{n}(x_{n+1}) + C \\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x_{n+1}-x_{k})$$\nSubstituting $p_{n+1}(x_{n+1}) = f(x_{n+1})$, we get:\n$$f(x_{n+1}) = p_{n}(x_{n+1}) + C \\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x_{n+1}-x_{k})$$\n\nWe can now solve for the constant $C$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$f(x_{n+1}) - p_{n}(x_{n+1}) = C \\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x_{n+1}-x_{k})$$\nSince the node $x_{n+1}$ is distinct from all previous nodes $x_{0}, \\dots, x_{n}$, each term $(x_{n+1}-x_{k})$ is non-zero. Consequently, their product is also non-zero, and we can divide by it to isolate $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{f(x_{n+1}) - p_{n}(x_{n+1})}{\\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x_{n+1}-x_{k})}$$\nThis constant $C$ is precisely the divided difference of $f$ with respect to the nodes $x_0, \\dots, x_{n+1}$, denoted $f[x_{0}, \\dots, x_{n+1}]$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $C$ back into our recursive formula for $p_{n+1}(x)$:\n$$p_{n+1}(x) = p_{n}(x) + \\left( \\frac{f(x_{n+1}) - p_{n}(x_{n+1})}{\\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x_{n+1}-x_{k})} \\right) \\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x-x_{k})$$\nThis is the desired simple, explicit recursive update formula for the interpolating polynomial. It expresses $p_{n+1}(x)$ purely in terms of $p_{n}(x)$, the nodes $x_0, \\dots, x_{n+1}$, the value $f(x_{n+1})$, and the value of the previous polynomial at the new node, $p_{n}(x_{n+1})$.",

This is equivalent to showing that the linear functionals are linearly independent, or that the determinant of the matrix representing the system of linear equations for the coefficients $(a_0, a_1, a_2)$ is non-zero.\n\nLet's translate the constraints into a system of linear equations for the coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2$:\n1. $p(-1) = a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) + a_0 = a_0 - a_1 + a_2 = 1$.\n2. $p(1) = a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) + a_0 = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 = 1$.\n3. $\\int_{-1}^{1} p(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} (a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0) \\, dx = \\left[ a_2 \\frac{x^3}{3} + a_1 \\frac{x^2}{2} + a_0 x \\right]_{-1}^{1}$.\n   Evaluating the integral at the limits gives:\n   $(\\frac{a_2}{3} + \\frac{a_1}{2} + a_0) - (-\\frac{a_2}{3} + \\frac{a_1}{2} - a_0) = \\frac{2a_2}{3} + 2a_0$.\n   The constraint is thus $2a_0 + \\frac{2}{3}a_2 = 0$.\n\nThe system of linear equations is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na_0 - a_1 + a_2 = 1 \\\\\na_0 + a_1 + a_2 = 1 \\\\\n2a_0 + \\frac{2}{3}a_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be written in matrix form $A\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\\\ a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and the coefficient matrix $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 & \\frac{2}{3} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo justify that the constraints uniquely determine $p(x)$, we must show that the matrix $A$ is invertible, which is true if its determinant is non-zero.\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1 \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} - 1 \\cdot 0 \\right) - (-1) \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} - 1 \\cdot 2 \\right) + 1 \\left( 1 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) + 1 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} - 2 \\right) - 2 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\left( -\\frac{4}{3} \\right) - 2 = -\\frac{2}{3} - 2 = -\\frac{8}{3}\n$$\nSince $\\det(A) = -\\frac{8}{3} \\neq 0$, the matrix is invertible, and the system has a unique solution for the coefficients $(a_0, a_1, a_2)$.
