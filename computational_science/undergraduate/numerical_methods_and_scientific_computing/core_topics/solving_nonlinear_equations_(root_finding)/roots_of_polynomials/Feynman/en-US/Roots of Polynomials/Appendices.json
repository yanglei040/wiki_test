This practice grounds the abstract concept of polynomial roots in a physical scenario of finding equilibrium positions .

            "problem": "In a one-dimensional physical system, the force acting on a particle as a function of its position $x$ (in dimensionless units) is described by the polynomial function $F(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x - 6$. The particle is considered to be in an equilibrium state when the net force acting on it is zero. Determine all the equilibrium positions of the particle. Present your final answer as a row matrix, with the positions listed in ascending order.",
            "solution": "An equilibrium position in one dimension occurs where the net force vanishes, so we solve $F(x)=0$ with\n$$\nF(x)=-x^{3}+2x^{2}+5x-6=0.\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ to simplify the leading coefficient gives\n$$\nx^{3}-2x^{2}-5x+6=0.\n$$\nBy the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are $\\pm 1,\\pm 2,\\pm 3,\\pm 6$. Evaluating at $x=1$ yields $1-2-5+6=0$, so $x=1$ is a root and $(x-1)$ is a factor. Dividing,\n$$\nx^{3}-2x^{2}-5x+6=(x-1)\\left(x^{2}-x-6\\right).\n$$\nFactoring the quadratic,\n$$\nx^{2}-x-6=(x-3)(x+2).\n$$\nThus the solutions to $F(x)=0$ are $x=-2$, $x=1$, and $x=3$. Listed in ascending order, the equilibrium positions are $-2$, $1$, and $3$.",
