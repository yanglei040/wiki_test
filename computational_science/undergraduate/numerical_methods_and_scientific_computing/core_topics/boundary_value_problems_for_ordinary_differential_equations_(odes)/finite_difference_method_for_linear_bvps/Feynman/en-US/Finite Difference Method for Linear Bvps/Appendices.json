The derivation must start from the core definitions of the first derivative and Taylor series expansions about grid points, and must not assume any pre-known discrete stencil. Specifically:\n- Begin with the definitions of the first derivative and apply Taylor series expansions near grid points to obtain second-order approximations.\n- Use the resulting approximations to discretize the operator $-(p u')'$ consistently at interior grid points. Treat $p(x)$ at half-grid locations so that the discrete operator is conservative.\n- Impose the Dirichlet boundary condition by directly prescribing the value at $x=a$.\n- Impose the Neumann boundary condition at $x=b$ using a second-order one-sided difference formula derived by Taylor series.\n- Assemble and solve the resulting linear system for the nodal values of $u(x)$.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Use a uniform grid with $N$ equal subintervals, grid points $x_i = a + i h$ for $i=0,1,\\dots,N$, and grid spacing $h = (b-a)/N$.\n- At each interior grid point, approximate the differential operator using second-order consistent flux differences that depend on $p(x)$ evaluated at half-grid locations.\n- Enforce the Neumann boundary condition at $x=b$ with a second-order one-sided finite difference relation for $u'(b)$.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case below, compute the maximum absolute error over all grid points by comparing the numerical solution to the provided exact solution.

            "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nWe are tasked with solving the linear second-order ordinary differential equation in self-adjoint form:\n$$\n-\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(p(x)\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + q(x)u(x) = r(x), \\quad x \\in [a, b]\n$$\nwith mixed boundary conditions: a Dirichlet condition $u(a) = \\alpha$ and a Neumann condition $u'(b) = \\beta$. The functions $p(x)$, $q(x)$, and $r(x)$ are given, with $p(x) > 0$. We will derive a second-order accurate finite difference method on a uniform grid and implement it.\n\n**1. Grid and Notation**\n\nWe define a uniform grid on the interval $[a,b]$ with $N$ subintervals. The grid points are $x_i = a + i h$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N$, where the grid spacing is $h = (b-a)/N$. The numerical solution at these points will be denoted by $U_i \\approx u(x_i)$. The unknowns to be solved for are $U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_N$, since $U_0 = u(a) = \\alpha$ is given by the Dirichlet boundary condition. This gives a system of $N$ unknowns.\n\n**2. Discretization at Interior Points**\n\nThe differential equation can be written as $-F'(x) + q(x)u(x) = r(x)$, where $F(x) = p(x)u'(x)$ is the flux.\nAt an interior grid point $x_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, N-1$, we approximate the term $-F'(x_i)$ using a second-order central difference centered at $x_i$:\n$$\n-F'(x_i) \\approx -\\frac{F(x_i + h/2) - F(x_i - h/2)}{h}\n$$\nThe half-grid points are denoted as $x_{i \\pm 1/2} = x_i \\pm h/2$. This approximation is $O(h^2)$ accurate.\n\nTo maintain second-order accuracy and the conservative property of the operator, we approximate the flux $F$ at these half-grid points. At $x_{i+1/2}$, we have $F(x_{i+1/2}) = p(x_{i+1/2}) u'(x_{i+1/2})$. We approximate the derivative $u'(x_{i+1/2})$ using a second-order central difference centered at $x_{i+1/2}$:\n$$\nu'(x_{i+1/2}) \\approx \\frac{u(x_{i+1}) - u(x_i)}{h} = \\frac{U_{i+1} - U_i}{h} + O(h^2)\n$$\nLetting $p_{i+1/2} = p(x_{i+1/2})$, the flux approximation is:\n$$\nF_{i+1/2} \\approx p_{i+1/2} \\frac{U_{i+1} - U_i}{h}\n$$\nSimilarly, at $x_{i-1/2}$:\n$$\nF_{i-1/2} \\approx p_{i-1/2} \\frac{U_i - U_{i-1}}{h}\n$$\nSubstituting these flux approximations back into the approximation for $-F'(x_i)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(p(x)\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)\\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx -\\frac{1}{h} \\left( p_{i+1/2} \\frac{U_{i+1} - U_i}{h} - p_{i-1/2} \\frac{U_i - U_{i-1}}{h} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{h^2} \\left[ -p_{i-1/2} U_{i-1} + (p_{i-1/2} + p_{i+1/2}) U_i - p_{i+1/2} U_{i+1} \\right]\n$$\nThe full discretized equation at an interior point $x_i$ ($i=1, \\dots, N-1$) is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{h^2} \\left[ -p_{i-1/2} U_{i-1} + (p_{i-1/2} + p_{i+1/2}) U_i - p_{i+1/2} U_{i+1} \\right] + q(x_i) U_i = r(x_i)\n$$\nMultiplying by $h^2$, we obtain the linear equation for row $i$:\n$$\n-p_{i-1/2} U_{i-1} + (p_{i-1/2} + p_{i+1/2} + h^2 q_i) U_i - p_{i+1/2} U_{i+1} = h^2 r_i\n$$\nwhere $q_i=q(x_i)$ and $r_i=r(x_i)$.\n\n**3. Discretization of Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe system requires $N$ equations for the $N$ unknowns $U_1, \\dots, U_N$. We have $N-1$ equations from the interior points. The remaining equation comes from the Neumann boundary condition at $x_N=b$.\n\n**Dirichlet condition at $x_0 = a$:**\nThe value $U_0$ is known: $U_0 = \\alpha$. This value is not an unknown. For the first equation ($i=1$), the term involving $U_0$ is moved to the right-hand side:\n$$\n(p_{1/2} + p_{3/2} + h^2 q_1) U_1 - p_{3/2} U_2 = h^2 r_1 + p_{1/2} U_0 = h^2 r_1 + p_{1/2} \\alpha\n$$\n\n**Neumann condition at $x_N = b$:**\nThe condition is $u'(b) = \\beta$. We are required to use a second-order accurate one-sided difference formula. We derive this by considering Taylor series expansions of $u(x)$ around $x_N$:\n$$\nu(x_{N-1}) = u(x_N - h) = u(x_N) - h u'(x_N) + \\frac{h^2}{2} u''(x_N) - \\frac{h^3}{6} u'''(x_N) + O(h^4)\n$$\n$$\nu(x_{N-2}) = u(x_N - 2h) = u(x_N) - 2h u'(x_N) + \\frac{(2h)^2}{2} u''(x_N) - \\frac{(2h)^3}{6} u'''(x_N) + O(h^4)\n$$\nTo create a formula for $u'(x_N)$ that is $O(h^2)$, we must eliminate the $u''(x_N)$ term. We multiply the first equation by $4$ and subtract the second:\n$$\n4u(x_{N-1}) - u(x_{N-2}) = 3u(x_N) - 2h u'(x_N) + O(h^3)\n$$\nSolving for $u'(x_N)$:\n$$\nu'(x_N) = \\frac{3u(x_N) - 4u(x_{N-1}) + u(x_{N-2})}{2h} + O(h^2)\n$$\nApplying this to our discrete problem at $x_N=b$, we get the final equation:\n$$\n\\frac{3U_N - 4U_{N-1} + U_{N-2}}{2h} = \\beta\n$$\nThis can be written as: $U_{N-2} - 4U_{N-1} + 3U_N = 2h\\beta$. Note that for the special case $N=2$, the point $x_{N-2}$ is $x_0$, so the equation involves the known value $U_0 = \\alpha$: $-4U_1 + 3U_2 = 2h\\beta - U_0 = 2h\\beta - \\alpha$.\n\n**4. Assembling the Linear System**\n\nWe assemble the $N \\times N$ linear system $A \\vec{U} = \\vec{F}$, where the vector of unknowns is $\\vec{U} = [U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_N]^T$. Let the matrix and vector indices be 0-based in correspondence with programming practice, where row/column $k$ corresponds to unknown $U_{k+1}$.\n\nFor $k = 0, \\dots, N-2$ (representing the ODE at grid points $x_{k+1}$):\nThe equation for $x_{j}$ ($j=k+1$) is: $-p_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}U_{j-1} + (p_{j-\\frac{1}{2}}+p_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}+h^2q_j)U_j -p_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}U_{j+1} = h^2r_j$.\n- **Row $k=0$ (for $U_1$):**\n  $A_{0,0} = p_{1/2} + p_{3/2} + h^2 q_1$\n  $A_{0,1} = -p_{3/2}$\n  $F_0 = h^2 r_1 + p_{1/2} \\alpha$\n- **Rows $k=1, \\dots, N-2$ (for $U_2, \\dots, U_{N-1}$):**\n  $j = k+1$. The unknowns are $U_j, U_{j \\pm 1}$, corresponding to `U_vec` indices $k, k \\pm 1$.\n  $A_{k, k-1} = -p_{k+1/2}$\n  $A_{k, k} = p_{k+1/2} + p_{k+3/2} + h^2 q_{k+1}$\n  $A_{k, k+1} = -p_{k+3/2}$\n  $F_k = h^2 r_{k+1}$\n\n- **Row $k=N-1$ (for $U_N$, from Neumann BC):**\n  - If $N \\ge 3$: The equation is $U_{N-2} - 4U_{N-1} + 3U_N = 2h\\beta$. The unknowns involved correspond to `U_vec` indices $N-3, N-2, N-1$.\n    $A_{N-1, N-3} = 1$\n    $A_{N-1, N-2} = -4$\n    $A_{N-1, N-1} = 3$\n    $F_{N-1} = 2h\\beta$\n  - If $N=2$: The equation is $-4U_1 + 3U_2 = 2h\\beta - \\alpha$. The unknowns are $U_1, U_2$, corresponding to `U_vec` indices $0, 1$.\n    $A_{1,0} = -4$\n    $A_{1,1} = 3$\n    $F_1 = 2h\\beta - \\alpha$\n\nThis fully specified linear system can be solved for $\\vec{U}$. The full numerical solution is then given by concatenating the Dirichlet value with the solved unknowns: $[U_0, U_1, \\dots, U_N]$. The maximum absolute error is then computed by comparing this vector with the exact solution evaluated at the grid points.",

            "solution": "The problem requires solving a one-dimensional linear boundary value problem (BVP) with a discontinuous forcing function using the finite difference method, and comparing the numerical solution to the exact analytical solution.\n\n### 1. Analytical Solution\nThe BVP is given by:\n$$\nu''(x) = f(x), \\quad x \\in (0,1)\n$$\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$. The forcing function $f(x)$ is a step function:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1, & 0 \\le x < x_c, \\\\\n0, & x_c \\le x \\le 1.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe solve this by integrating $u''(x)$ piecewise on the two subintervals defined by the discontinuity at $x=x_c$.\n\nFor $0 \\le x < x_c$, we have $u''(x) = 1$. Integrating twice with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$\nu'(x) = x + A\n$$\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + Ax + B\n$$\nFor $x_c \\le x \\le 1$, we have $u''(x) = 0$. Integrating twice yields:\n$$\nu'(x) = C\n$$\n$$\nu(x) = Cx + D\n$$\nwhere $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constants of integration. These are determined by the boundary conditions and by enforcing continuity of the solution $u(x)$ and its first derivative $u'(x)$ at $x=x_c$. A physical system corresponding to this equation (e.g., a string under a piecewise constant load) requires that the string itself does not break ($u$ is continuous) and does not have a kink ($u'$ is continuous).\n\n1.  **Boundary condition at $x=0$**: $u(0)=0$. Assuming $x_c>0$, we use the first form of the solution:\n    $u(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 + A(0) + B = 0 \\implies B=0$.\n\n2.  **Boundary condition at $x=1$**: $u(1)=0$. We use the second form:\n    $u(1) = C(1) + D = 0 \\implies D=-C$.\n\n3.  **Continuity of $u(x)$ at $x=x_c$**: The values from both pieces must match, $u(x_c^-) = u(x_c^+)$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{2}x_c^2 + Ax_c = Cx_c + D\n    $$\n    Substituting $B=0$ and $D=-C$, we get:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{2}x_c^2 + Ax_c = C(x_c - 1) \\quad (\\text{Eq. 1})\n    $$\n\n4.  **Continuity of $u'(x)$ at $x=x_c$**: The derivatives must also match, $u'(x_c^-) = u'(x_c^+)$.\n    $$\n    x_c + A = C \\quad (\\text{Eq. 2})\n    $$\n\nWe now solve the system of two linear equations (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2) for $A$ and $C$. From Eq. 2, we have $A = C-x_c$. Substituting this into Eq. 1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}x_c^2 + (C-x_c)x_c = C(x_c - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}x_c^2 + Cx_c - x_c^2 = Cx_c - C\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}x_c^2 = -C \\implies C = \\frac{1}{2}x_c^2\n$$\nNow, we find the other constants:\n$A = C - x_c = \\frac{1}{2}x_c^2 - x_c$\n$D = -C = -\\frac{1}{2}x_c^2$\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the piecewise expressions for $u(x)$, the exact analytical solution is:\n$$\nu(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x_c^2 - x_c\\right)x, & 0 \\le x < x_c \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}x_c^2 (x-1), & x_c \\le x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n### 2. Finite Difference Method\nWe discretize the domain $[0,1]$ using a uniform mesh with $N$ subintervals of width $h=1/N$. The grid nodes are $x_i = ih$ for $i=0,1,\\dots,N$. Let $u_i$ be the numerical approximation of $u(x_i)$.\n\nThe second derivative $u''(x_i)$ is approximated by a second-order central difference formula:\n$$\nu''(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{h^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the BVP at each interior node $x_i$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, N-1$, we obtain a system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{h^2} = f(x_i)\n$$\nThe boundary conditions give $u_0=0$ and $u_N=0$. Rearranging the equations, we get:\n$$\nu_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1} = h^2 f(x_i), \\quad i=1, 2, \\dots, N-1\n$$\nThis forms a linear system $A \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the vector of unknowns $\\mathbf{u} = [u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-1}]^T$. The matrix $A$ is an $(N-1) \\times (N-1)$ tridiagonal matrix:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & 1 & & & \\\\\n1 & -2 & 1 & & \\\\\n& \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\n& & 1 & -2 & 1 \\\\\n& & & 1 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ has components $b_{i-1} = h^2 f(x_i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, N-1$. The value of $f(x_i)$ is $1$ if $x_i < x_c$ and $0$ if $x_i \\ge x_c$. This system is non-singular and can be solved efficiently, for instance, using a standard linear solver.\n\n### 3. Error Computation\nOnce the numerical solution $\\{u_i\\}_{i=0}^N$ is found, we compute the error by comparing it to the exact solution $\\{u(x_i)\\}_{i=0}^N$.\nThe required error metrics are:\n- The maximum absolute error over the interior nodes:\n  $$\n  E_{\\infty} = \\max_{1\\le i \\le N-1} \\left|u_i - u(x_i)\\right|\n  $$\n- The local errors at grid points bracketing the discontinuity. The indices $i_L$ (left) and $i_R$ (right) are determined as specified:\n  - If $x_c$ does not coincide with a grid node $x_k$, $i_L = \\lfloor x_c/h \\rfloor$ and $i_R = i_L + 1$. The problem statement implies these indices should be within the valid range for interior points near the discontinuity.\n  - If $x_c$ coincides with a grid node $x_k$, $i_L = \\max(1,k-1)$ and $i_R = \\min(N-1,k+1)$.\n  The errors are then computed as:\n  $$\n  E_L = \\left|u_{i_L} - u(x_{i_L})\\right|, \\quad E_R = \\left|u_{i_R} - u(x_{i_R})\\right|\n  $$\nThe Python program below implements this entire process for the given test suite.",

I will proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nWe begin by discretizing the given boundary value problem.\nThe differential equation is evaluated at the interior grid points $x_i = i h$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$, where $h = 1/(N+1)$:\n$$\n-u''(x_i) - \\pi^2 u(x_i) = f(x_i)\n$$\nThe second derivative $u''(x_i)$ is approximated using a second-order central difference formula:\n$$\nu''(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u(x_i - h) - 2u(x_i) + u(x_i + h)}{h^2} = \\frac{u(x_{i-1}) - 2u(x_i) + u(x_{i+1})}{h^2}\n$$\nReplacing the continuous function $u(x_i)$ with its discrete approximation $u_i$, we obtain the system of linear equations:\n$$\n-\\frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{h^2} - \\pi^2 u_i = f_i\n$$\nwhere $f_i = f(x_i)$. Rearranging the terms yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{h^2} (-u_{i-1} + 2u_i - u_{i+1}) - \\pi^2 u_i = f_i\n$$\nThis equation holds for $i=1, \\dots, N$. The boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$ imply $u_0=0$ and $u_{N+1}=0$.\nFor $i=1$: $\\frac{1}{h^2} (2u_1 - u_2) - \\pi^2 u_1 = f_1$.\nFor $i=N$: $\\frac{1}{h^2} (-u_{N-1} + 2u_N) - \\pi^2 u_N = f_N$.\n\nThese $N$ linear equations can be written in the matrix form $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{b}$. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix, $\\mathbf{u} = [u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_N]^T$, and $\\mathbf{b} = [f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_N]^T$.\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ can be expressed as the sum of two matrices: one from the discretized second derivative and one from the $-\\pi^2 u(x)$ term.\nLet $\\mathbf{L}_N$ be the matrix representing the finite difference approximation of the negative second derivative operator, $-d^2/dx^2$. Its entries are derived from the term $\\frac{1}{h^2}(-u_{i-1} + 2u_i - u_{i+1})$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}_N = \\frac{1}{h^2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2  -1  0  \\cdots  0 \\\\\n-1  2  -1  \\cdots  0 \\\\\n0  -1  2  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\ddots  -1 \\\\\n0  0  \\cdots  -1  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe term $-\\pi^2 u_i$ contributes $-\\pi^2 \\mathbf{I}$ to the system matrix, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $N \\times N$ identity matrix.\nThus, the system matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}_N - \\pi^2 \\mathbf{I}\n$$\nThe entries of $\\mathbf{A}$ are explicitly given by:\n$$\nA_{ij} = \\begin{cases} \\frac{2}{h^2} - \\pi^2  \\text{if } i=j \\\\ -\\frac{1}{h^2}  \\text{if } |i-j|=1 \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the continuous operator $\\mathcal{L}u = -u'' - \\pi^2 u$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. This is a Sturm-Liouville operator. Its nullspace consists of non-trivial solutions to $\\mathcal{L}u=0$, which is the homogeneous equation $-u'' - \\pi^2 u = 0$, or $u'' + \\pi^2 u = 0$. The general solution is $u(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\pi x) + C_2 \\sin(\\pi x)$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n1. $u(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 = 0$. The solution must be of the form $u(x) = C_2 \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n2. $u(1) = C_2 \\sin(\\pi) = C_2 \\cdot 0 = 0$. This condition is satisfied for any value of $C_2$.\nTherefore, any function $u(x) = C \\sin(\\pi x)$ for any constant $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a solution. The nullspace is non-trivial and is spanned by the eigenfunction $\\phi_1(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. This is because $\\pi^2$ is the first eigenvalue of the negative Laplacian operator $-d^2/dx^2$ on $(0,1)$ with these boundary conditions.\nFor the inhomogeneous problem $\\mathcal{L}u = f$ to have a solution, the Fredholm Alternative theorem requires the right-hand side $f(x)$ to be orthogonal to the nullspace of the adjoint operator $\\mathcal{L}^*$. Since $\\mathcal{L}$ is self-adjoint, the compatibility condition is that $f(x)$ must be orthogonal to the nullspace of $\\mathcal{L}$. This means:\n$$\n\\langle f, \\phi_1 \\rangle = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\sin(\\pi x) \\, dx = 0\n$$\n\nWe now analyze the discrete matrix $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L}_N - \\pi^2 \\mathbf{I}$. The matrix $\\mathbf{L}_N$ is a symmetric tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix. Its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are well-known. The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{L}_N$, which are approximations of the eigenvalues $k^2 \\pi^2$ of the continuous operator $-d^2/dx^2$, are given by:\n$$\n\\mu_k = \\frac{2}{h^2} (1 - \\cos(k \\pi h)) = \\frac{4}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\pi h}{2}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, \\dots, N\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are obtained by shifting the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{L}_N$:\n$$\n\\lambda_k(\\mathbf{A}) = \\mu_k - \\pi^2 = \\frac{4}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\pi h}{2}\\right) - \\pi^2 = 4(N+1)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right) - \\pi^2\n$$\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is singular if and only if $\\lambda_k(\\mathbf{A}) = 0$ for some $k$. This would require $2(N+1) \\sin\\left(\\frac{k \\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right) = \\pi$. For $x \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, we have the inequality $\\sin(x)  x$. Letting $x = \\frac{k\\pi}{2(N+1)}$, we have $2(N+1)\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right)  2(N+1)\\frac{k\\pi}{2(N+1)} = k\\pi$. For this to equal $\\pi$, we would need $k=1$ and for the inequality to be an equality, which is not possible for $x0$. Thus, $\\lambda_k(\\mathbf{A}) \\ne 0$ for any $k$ and finite $N$. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is never exactly singular.\n\nHowever, for $k=1$, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is very close to zero. Using the Taylor expansion $\\sin(x) = x - x^3/6 + O(x^5)$ for small $x = \\pi h/2$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1(\\mathbf{A}) = \\frac{4}{h^2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi h}{2} - \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{\\pi h}{2}\\right)^3 + O(h^5) \\right)^2 - \\pi^2 = \\pi^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\pi^2 h^2}{12} + O(h^4) \\right) - \\pi^2 = -\\frac{\\pi^4 h^2}{12} + O(h^4)\n$$\nThis eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ approaches $0$ as $h \\to 0$ (i.e., $N \\to \\infty$). This near-singularity makes the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ ill-conditioned. Since $\\mathbf{A}$ is symmetric, its singular values are the absolute values of its eigenvalues, $\\sigma_k = |\\lambda_k|$. The smallest singular value is $\\sigma_{\\min} = |\\lambda_1| = |\\mu_1 - \\pi^2| \\approx \\frac{\\pi^4 h^2}{12}$.\n\nThe spectral condition number is $\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{A}) = \\sigma_{\\max}/\\sigma_{\\min} = \\max_k|\\lambda_k|/\\min_k|\\lambda_k|$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ form an increasing sequence. $\\lambda_1$ is small and negative, while $\\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_N$ are positive. The largest eigenvalue in magnitude is $\\lambda_N$:\n$$\n\\lambda_N = \\frac{4}{h^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{N \\pi h}{2}\\right) - \\pi^2 = \\frac{4}{h^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{N \\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right) - \\pi^2\n$$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, $h \\to 0$ and $\\frac{N}{N+1} \\to 1$, so $\\lambda_N \\to \\frac{4}{h^2} - \\pi^2 \\approx 4(N+1)^2$.\nThe condition number therefore behaves as:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{A}) = \\frac{|\\lambda_N|}{|\\lambda_1|} \\approx \\frac{4/h^2}{\\pi^4 h^2/12} = \\frac{48}{\\pi^4 h^4} = O((N+1)^4)\n$$\nThe condition number grows as $N^4$, indicating severe ill-conditioning for large $N$. This reflects the fact that the discrete problem is approximating a continuous problem that is not unconditionally solvable.",
