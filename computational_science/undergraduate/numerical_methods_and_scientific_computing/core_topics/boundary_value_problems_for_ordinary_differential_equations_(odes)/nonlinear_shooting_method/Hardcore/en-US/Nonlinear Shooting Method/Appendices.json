This exercise  tackles a linear boundary value problem governing heat conduction, for which an exact analytical solution exists. By treating the initial temperature gradient as an unknown \"shooting\" parameter, you will see how the boundary condition at the far end creates a simple algebraic equation, allowing you to determine the correct initial conditions without needing a numerical root-finder.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem asks for an analytical solution to a linear boundary value problem (BVP) using the conceptual framework of the shooting method. While the shooting method is typically implemented numerically for nonlinear problems, its application here to a linear problem is a valid exercise that results in a linear algebraic equation for the unknown initial condition, which can be solved analytically.\n\nThe governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$\nT''(x) = -q(x)\n$$\nwith the specific heat source $q(x) = 10 \\exp(2x)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nT''(x) = -10 \\exp(2x)\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are $T(0) = T_a = 310$ and $T(L) = T(1) = T_b = 325$.\n\nFollowing the shooting methodology, we convert this BVP into an initial value problem (IVP). We introduce an unknown initial slope, $s = T'(0)$. The IVP is thus defined by the ODE and the initial conditions:\n$$\nT(0) = 310\n$$\n$$\nT'(0) = s\n$$\nOur goal is to find the value of $s$ that ensures the solution to this IVP also satisfies the second boundary condition, $T(1) = 325$.\n\nFirst, we integrate the ODE $T''(x) = -10 \\exp(2x)$ with respect to $x$ to find the expression for the temperature gradient, $T'(x)$:\n$$\nT'(x) = \\int -10 \\exp(2x) \\, dx = -10 \\frac{\\exp(2x)}{2} + C_1 = -5 \\exp(2x) + C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the constant of integration. We use the initial condition $T'(0) = s$ to determine $C_1$:\n$$\ns = T'(0) = -5 \\exp(2 \\cdot 0) + C_1 = -5 \\exp(0) + C_1 = -5(1) + C_1\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$, we get:\n$$\nC_1 = s + 5\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $T'(x)$, we have:\n$$\nT'(x) = -5 \\exp(2x) + s + 5\n$$\nNext, we integrate $T'(x)$ with respect to $x$ to find the temperature distribution, $T(x)$:\n$$\nT(x) = \\int \\left(-5 \\exp(2x) + s + 5\\right) \\, dx = -5 \\frac{\\exp(2x)}{2} + (s + 5)x + C_2\n$$\n$$\nT(x) = -\\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2x) + (s + 5)x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration. We use the initial condition $T(0) = 310$ to determine $C_2$:\n$$\n310 = T(0) = -\\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2 \\cdot 0) + (s+5)(0) + C_2 = -\\frac{5}{2} \\exp(0) + C_2 = -\\frac{5}{2} + C_2\n$$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$\nC_2 = 310 + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{620}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{625}{2}\n$$\nThe solution to the IVP, which depends on the parameter $s$, is therefore:\n$$\nT(x; s) = -\\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2x) + (s + 5)x + \\frac{625}{2}\n$$\nNow, we enforce the second boundary condition, $T(1) = 325$, to find the correct value of $s$. We set $x=1$ and $T(1;s) = 325$:\n$$\n325 = T(1; s) = -\\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2 \\cdot 1) + (s + 5)(1) + \\frac{625}{2}\n$$\n$$\n325 = -\\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2) + s + 5 + \\frac{625}{2}\n$$\nNow, we solve this linear equation for $s$. It is convenient to work with fractions: $325 = \\frac{650}{2}$ and $5 = \\frac{10}{2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{650}{2} = -\\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2) + s + \\frac{10}{2} + \\frac{625}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{650}{2} = s + \\frac{635}{2} - \\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2)\n$$\nIsolating $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{650}{2} - \\frac{635}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2)\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{15}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2)\n$$\nHaving found the unique value of the initial slope $s$, we substitute it back into the general solution $T(x;s)$ to obtain the final expression for $T(x)$:\n$$\nT(x) = -\\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2x) + \\left( \\left(\\frac{15}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} \\exp(2)\\right) + 5 \\right)x + \\frac{625}{2}\n$$\nWe simplify the coefficient of the $x$ term.

The results are computationally reproducible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be developed by implementing the specified numerical algorithms.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution to the nonlinear boundary value problem (BVP) $y'' = y^2$ with boundary conditions $y(a) = \\alpha$ and $y(b) = \\beta$ will be constructed based on the shooting method. This involves three core principles: converting the BVP into an initial value problem (IVP), integrating the IVP numerically, and using a root-finding algorithm to satisfy the terminal boundary condition.\n\n**1. Conversion of the Second-Order ODE to a First-Order System**\n\nTo apply standard numerical integrators like Runge-Kutta, the second-order ODE must be expressed as a system of first-order ODEs. We introduce a new state variable, $v$, representing the first derivative of $y$:\n$$\ny' = v\n$$\nDifferentiating this expression gives $y'' = v'$. Substituting this into the original ODE, $y'' = y^2$, yields:\n$$\nv' = y^2\n$$\nWe can now define a state vector $\\mathbf{u}(x) = [y(x), v(x)]^T$. The first-order system is then given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dx} = \\mathbf{f}(x, \\mathbf{u}) = \\begin{pmatrix} y' \\\\ v' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ y^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe initial conditions for this system at $x=a$ are derived from the BVP's condition at $a$ and the introduction of the shooting parameter $s$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(a) = \\begin{pmatrix} y(a) \\\\ v(a) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y(a) \\\\ y'(a) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ s \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2. The Shooting Method and the Mismatch Function**\n\nThe shooting method re-frames the BVP as a root-finding problem. For any chosen initial slope $s = y'(a)$, the first-order system above becomes a well-defined IVP. We can integrate this IVP from $x=a$ to $x=b$. The resulting value of $y$ at $x=b$ will be a function of the initial choice of $s$, which we denote as $y(b; s)$.\n\nThe goal is to find the specific value of $s$ for which this computed terminal value matches the desired boundary condition, $y(b) = \\beta$. This is expressed by defining a mismatch function, $F(s)$, which must be zero for the correct $s$:\n$$\nF(s) = y(b; s) - \\beta = 0\n$$\nSolving the BVP is now equivalent to finding the root of the function $F(s)$.\n\n**3. Numerical Integration via the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) Method**\n\nTo evaluate $F(s)$ for a given $s$, we must numerically solve the IVP from $x=a$ to $x=b$. The problem specifies the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a uniform step size $h = (b-a)/N$. Given the state $\\mathbf{u}_i$ at step $i$, the state $\\mathbf{u}_{i+1}$ at the next step is calculated as follows:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}_1 = h \\mathbf{f}(x_i, \\mathbf{u}_i) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_2 = h \\mathbf{f}(x_i + h/2, \\mathbf{u}_i + \\mathbf{k}_1/2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_3 = h \\mathbf{f}(x_i + h/2, \\mathbf{u}_i + \\mathbf{k}_2/2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{k}_4 = h \\mathbf{f}(x_i + h, \\mathbf{u}_i + \\mathbf{k}_3) \\\\\n\\mathbf{u}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{u}_i + \\frac{1}{6}(\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}_i = [y_i, v_i]^T$. The process starts with $\\mathbf{u}_0 = [\\alpha, s]^T$ and iterates $N$ times to obtain $\\mathbf{u}_N = [y_N, v_N]^T$, which is our numerical approximation for $\\mathbf{u}(b)$. The value $y(b;s)$ is then approximated by $y_N$.\n\n**4. Root-Finding via the Secant Method**\n\nThe secant method is an iterative root-finding algorithm that approximates the derivative in Newton's method using a finite difference. Given two initial guesses for the slope, $s_0$ and $s_1$, and their corresponding function values, $F_0 = F(s_0)$ and $F_1 = F(s_1)$, the next guess $s_2$ is found by linearly extrapolating to the root. The general update rule is:\n$$\ns_{k+1} = s_k - F(s_k) \\frac{s_k - s_{k-1}}{F(s_k) - F(s_{k-1})}\n$$\nThe procedure for finding the root is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the naive linear slope estimate: $s_{\\text{lin}} = (\\beta - \\alpha)/(b-a)$.\n2.  Generate two initial guesses: $s_0 = s_{\\text{lin}} - 0.1\\,(1+|s_{\\text{lin}}|)$ and $s_1 = s_{\\text{lin}} + 0.1\\,(1+|s_{\\text{lin}}|)$.\n3.  Compute $F_0 = F(s_0)$ and $F_1 = F(s_1)$ by performing two separate RK4 integrations.\n4.  Iterate using the secant update rule for at most $50$ iterations or until $|F(s_k)| < 10^{-8}$. The iteration is also terminated if the denominator $|F(s_k) - F(s_{k-1})|$ becomes too small, indicating a potential stall or division by zero.\n5.  The final iterate $s_k$ that satisfies the convergence criterion is the desired shooting parameter.\n\nBy integrating these four principles, we can construct a program to solve the given BVP for each test case.",

            "introduction": "While the secant method is robust, we can often achieve faster convergence by using Newton's method, which leverages derivative information. This advanced practice  challenges you to implement a more sophisticated shooter based on Newton's method. The key to this approach is computing the derivative of the shooting function, which you will accomplish by deriving and simultaneously integrating the corresponding variational (or sensitivity) equations alongside the original ODE. This powerful technique provides deeper insight into how the solution's endpoint responds to changes in the initial slope and is a cornerstone of advanced scientific computing.",

            "problem": "Implement a program that solves nonlinear two-point boundary value problems by the shooting method with Newton-Raphson iteration on the unknown initial slope and with simultaneous integration of the variational (sensitivity) equation for $\\partial y/\\partial s$. The fundamental basis for the design is the standard reduction of a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) to a first-order system and the chain rule for sensitivity of the terminal value with respect to the initial slope.\n\nYou are given a scalar second-order ODE of the form\n$$\ny''(x) = f\\big(x, y(x), y'(x)\\big),\n$$\nposed on the interval $[a,b]$ with boundary conditions\n$$\ny(a) = \\alpha,\\quad y(b) = \\beta,\n$$\nwhere $f$ is a sufficiently smooth function. The shooting method treats the unknown initial slope $s = y'(a)$ as a parameter and defines the residual\n$$\nR(s) = y(b; s) - \\beta,\n$$\nwhere $y(b; s)$ is the terminal value obtained by integrating the initial value problem\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny'(x) &= p(x),\\\\\np'(x) &= f(x, y(x), p(x)),\\\\\ny(a) &= \\alpha,\\quad p(a) = s,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nfrom $x=a$ to $x=b$. Newton-Raphson iteration updates $s$ by\n$$\ns_{k+1} = s_k - \\frac{R(s_k)}{R'(s_k)},\n$$\nrequiring the derivative $R'(s)$. By differentiating the first-order system with respect to $s$ and applying the chain rule, the sensitivity system is\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_1'(x) &= v_2(x),\\\\\nv_2'(x) &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x, y(x), p(x))\\, v_1(x) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p}(x, y(x), p(x))\\, v_2(x),\\\\\nv_1(a) &= 0,\\quad v_2(a) = 1,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $v_1(x) = \\frac{\\partial y(x)}{\\partial s}$ and $v_2(x) = \\frac{\\partial p(x)}{\\partial s}$. Then $R'(s) = v_1(b)$. Your implementation must integrate $(y,p,v_1,v_2)$ simultaneously using the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) and must perform Newton-Raphson updates of $s$. To promote robust convergence, use a simple backtracking line search on the Newton step: if a full Newton update does not reduce $|R(s)|$, halve the step repeatedly until a reduction is achieved or until a small step factor threshold is reached.\n\nNumerical integration details:\n- Use the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) on the augmented system for $(y,p,v_1,v_2)$ with a uniform step size $h = (b-a)/N$, where $N$ is a positive integer provided per test case.\n- Terminate Newton-Raphson when $|R(s)| \\le \\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$ or after a maximum of $M = 30$ iterations. If backtracking fails to reduce the residual after $L = 20$ halvings, accept the attempted update and continue.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement the solver and apply it to the following three boundary value problems. In each case, define $f$, its partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p}$, the interval endpoints $a$ and $b$, boundary values $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the initial guess $s_0$, and the number of integration steps $N$.\n\n- Case $1$ (nonlinear with dependence on $y'$):\n  - $f(x,y,p) = \\sin(y) + x p$\n  - $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y,p) = \\cos(y)$\n  - $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p}(x,y,p) = x$\n  - $a = 0$, $b = 1$\n  - $\\alpha = 0$, $\\beta = 0.5$\n  - $s_0 = 0.3$\n  - $N = 2000$\n\n- Case $2$ (nonlinear with trivial solution as a boundary condition edge case):\n  - $f(x,y,p) = y^3 - y$\n  - $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y,p) = 3y^2 - 1$\n  - $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p}(x,y,p) = 0$\n  - $a = 0$, $b = 1$\n  - $\\alpha = 0$, $\\beta = 0$\n  - $s_0 = 1.0$\n  - $N = 2000$\n\n- Case $3$ (linear reference problem for accuracy validation):\n  - $f(x,y,p) = y$\n  - $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y,p) = 1$\n  - $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p}(x,y,p) = 0$\n  - $a = 0$, $b = 1$\n  - $\\alpha = 0$, $\\beta = 1$\n  - $s_0 = 0.5$\n  - $N = 2000$\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, compute the Newton-Raphson estimate $s^*$ of the shooting parameter $s$ such that $|R(s^*)| \\le \\varepsilon$.\n- Express each $s^*$ as a decimal rounded to eight decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the three rounded values as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[s_1,s_2,s_3]$.\n\nNo physical units or angle units are involved in this problem.

            "solution": "The problem presented requires the implementation of a numerical algorithm to solve a nonlinear two-point boundary value problem (BVP) of the form\n$$\ny''(x) = f\\big(x, y(x), y'(x)\\big), \\quad x \\in [a,b]\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $y(a) = \\alpha$ and $y(b) = \\beta$. The specified method is the nonlinear shooting method, where the BVP is converted into an initial value problem (IVP) and the unknown initial condition is adjusted iteratively until the boundary condition at the far end is met. The iterative adjustment is to be performed using the Newton-Raphson method, which necessitates the derivative of the final state with respect to the initial condition. This derivative is to be found by integrating a set of auxiliary differential equations known as the sensitivity equations.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the shooting method framework. We reduce the second-order ODE to a system of two first-order ODEs by letting $p(x) = y'(x)$. The system is then:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny'(x) &= p(x) \\\\\np'(x) &= f(x, y(x), p(x)).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are $y(a) = \\alpha$ and $y(b) = \\beta$. In the shooting method, we treat this as an IVP starting from $x=a$. The initial condition $y(a)=\\alpha$ is known, but $p(a) = y'(a)$ is not. We shall denote this unknown initial slope as a parameter, $s$, so that $p(a) = s$. With this, we can integrate the system from $x=a$ to $x=b$. The value of $y$ at $x=b$ will depend on our choice of $s$. Let us denote this functional dependence as $y(b; s)$. The objective is to find the value of $s$ for which the computed terminal value matches the required boundary condition, i.e., $y(b; s) = \\beta$. This condition is expressed by defining a residual function, $R(s)$, whose root we seek:\n$$\nR(s) = y(b; s) - \\beta = 0.\n$$\nThis is a root-finding problem for the single variable $s$. The problem specifies using the Newton-Raphson method for this task. The iterative formula for updating an estimate $s_k$ to a new estimate $s_{k+1}$ is:\n$$\ns_{k+1} = s_k - \\frac{R(s_k)}{R'(s_k)},\n$$\nwhere $R'(s_k)$ is the derivative of the residual function with respect to $s$, evaluated at $s_k$. This derivative is $R'(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( y(b; s) - \\beta \\right) = \\frac{\\partial y(b; s)}{\\partial s}$.\n\nTo find $\\frac{\\partial y(b; s)}{\\partial s}$, we derive the sensitivity equations. Let us define the sensitivity variables $v_1(x) = \\frac{\\partial y(x)}{\\partial s}$ and $v_2(x) = \\frac{\\partial p(x)}{\\partial s}$. We differentiate the first-order system with respect to $s$ using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} (y'(x)) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} (p(x)) \\implies \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s}\\right)' = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial s} \\implies v_1'(x) = v_2(x).\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} (p'(x)) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} f(x, y, p) \\implies \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial s}\\right)' = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial s} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial s} \\implies v_2'(x) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} v_1(x) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} v_2(x).\n$$\nThis gives us a linear system of ODEs for the sensitivities $(v_1, v_2)$. To solve it, we require a set of initial conditions at $x=a$. These are derived from the initial conditions of the primary system:\n$$\ny(a) = \\alpha \\implies v_1(a) = \\frac{\\partial y(a)}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial s} = 0.\n$$\n$$\np(a) = s \\implies v_2(a) = \\frac{\\partial p(a)}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial s} = 1.\n$$\nThe derivative of the residual is then $R'(s) = v_1(b)$.\n\nThe overall strategy is to solve an augmented system of four first-order ODEs for the state vector $\\mathbf{U}(x) = [y(x), p(x), v_1(x), v_2(x)]^T$. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{U}'(x) = \\mathbf{F}(x, \\mathbf{U}(x)) = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\np(x) \\\\\nf(x, y(x), p(x)) \\\\\nv_2(x) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} v_1(x) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} v_2(x)\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFor a given guess $s_k$, the initial condition for this augmented system at $x=a$ is $\\mathbf{U}(a) = [\\alpha, s_k, 0, 1]^T$.\n\nThe numerical procedure for one Newton-Raphson iteration is as follows:\n1.  Set the initial vector $\\mathbf{U}(a) = [\\alpha, s_k, 0, 1]^T$.\n2.  Integrate the $4$-dimensional system for $\\mathbf{U}'(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ using the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method with a step size of $h=(b-a)/N$. The integration yields the terminal state vector $\\mathbf{U}(b) = [y(b;s_k), p(b;s_k), v_1(b;s_k), v_2(b;s_k)]^T$.\n3.  Calculate the residual $R(s_k) = y(b;s_k) - \\beta$.\n4.  Check for convergence: if $|R(s_k)| \\le \\varepsilon=10^{-10}$, the process terminates.\n5.  Calculate the derivative of the residual $R'(s_k) = v_1(b;s_k)$.\n6.  Compute the Newton step $\\Delta s_k = -R(s_k)/R'(s_k)$.\n7.  To ensure robust convergence, perform a backtracking line search. The full step $s_k + \\Delta s_k$ is attempted. If it does not reduce the magnitude of the residual, i.e., $|R(s_k + \\Delta s_k)| \\ge |R(s_k)|$, the step is halved repeatedly. A new trial step $\\lambda \\Delta s_k$ is tested with $\\lambda \\in \\{1, 1/2, 1/4, \\dots\\}$. The first value of $\\lambda$ that produces a reduction in the residual's magnitude is accepted.\n8.  If $L=20$ halvings fail to find a better step, the last attempted update (with the smallest $\\lambda$) is accepted, and the iteration proceeds.\n9.  Update the slope estimate, $s_{k+1} = s_k + \\lambda \\Delta s_k$, and repeat from step 1.\nThe process is terminated if convergence is achieved or after a maximum of $M=30$ iterations. The final value of $s_k$ is taken as the solution $s^\\ast$. This algorithm is implemented and applied to the three specified test cases.",
