            "problem": "Implement a complete, runnable program that computes an eigenvalue of a real square matrix using the inverse power method with a dynamic shift given by the Rayleigh quotient of the current iterate. The goal is to approximate an eigenvalue of a real matrix by iteratively solving a shifted linear system and updating the shift from first principles.\n\nYou must design your algorithm starting from the following foundational base:\n- The definition of an eigenpair: a nonzero vector $\\boldsymbol{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and a scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $A \\boldsymbol{v} = \\lambda \\boldsymbol{v}$.\n- The Rayleigh quotient of a nonzero vector $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ for a real matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, defined as the scalar that equals the unique scalar multiple minimizing the residual in the least-squares sense when approximating $A \\boldsymbol{x}$ by a multiple of $\\boldsymbol{x}$. This quotient equals the eigenvalue when $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is an eigenvector.\n- The inverse iteration idea: if $\\sigma$ is close to an eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then the linear system $(A - \\sigma I)\\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{x}$ is nearly singular and its solution tends to amplify the component of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector. Normalizing $\\boldsymbol{y}$ then yields an improved iterate.\n\nYou must not assume any special matrix structure beyond real entries. Your implementation must:\n- Use only real arithmetic.\n- Normalize the iterate at every step using the Euclidean norm.\n- Use the current iterate’s Rayleigh quotient as the dynamic shift.\n- Solve the linear systems with Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (standard dense direct solve). If a solve fails due to singularity or near singularity, apply a minimal diagonal regularization by solving with $(A - \\sigma I + \\epsilon I)$ where $\\epsilon = 10^{-14} \\max(1, \\lVert A \\rVert_2)$, and retry. If the initial iterate already satisfies the eigenpair equation to within tolerance, terminate immediately without attempting to solve a singular system.\n- Terminate when the residual norm $\\lVert A \\boldsymbol{x}_k - \\mu_k \\boldsymbol{x}_k \\rVert_2$ is less than or equal to a given tolerance, or when a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nInput is not required; your program must hard-code the following test suite and produce a single line of output as specified below.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case 1 (happy path, diagonal):\n  - $A_1 = \\mathrm{diag}(1, 2, 5)$.\n  - $\\boldsymbol{x}_0^{(1)} = [0.2, 0.2, 0.96]^T$.\n  - Tolerance $= 10^{-12}$, maximum iterations $= 100$.\n- Case 2 (boundary, immediate convergence due to exact eigenvector up to scaling):\n  - $$A_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$.\n  - $\\boldsymbol{x}_0^{(2)} = [1, 1]^T$.\n  - Tolerance $= 10^{-12}$, maximum iterations $= 50$.\n- Case 3 (clustered spectrum):\n  - $$A_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 10^{-3} & 0 \\\\ 10^{-3} & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$$.\n  - $\\boldsymbol{x}_0^{(3)} = [1, -1, 0.1]^T$.\n  - Tolerance $= 10^{-12}$, maximum iterations $= 100$.\n- Case 4 (symmetric tridiagonal):\n  - $$A_4 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$$.\n  - $\\boldsymbol{x}_0^{(4)} = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]^T$.\n  - Tolerance $= 10^{-12}$, maximum iterations $= 100$.\n\nFor each case, your program must compute:\n- The final approximate eigenvalue $\\mu$ given by the Rayleigh quotient of the last iterate.\n- The final residual norm $r = \\lVert A \\boldsymbol{x} - \\mu \\boldsymbol{x} \\rVert_2$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Produce a single line containing a list of length $4$, where each element is a two-element list $[\\mu, r]$ corresponding to the cases in the order above.\n- Both $\\mu$ and $r$ must be rounded to exactly $10$ decimal places.\n- The line must contain no spaces.

Express all decimals as plain decimal numbers. The final output must be deterministic and must not require any user input or external data.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of the Rayleigh Quotient Iteration (RQI), a numerical method to find an eigenpair $(\\lambda, \\boldsymbol{v})$ of a real square matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. An eigenpair is defined by the fundamental relationship $A \\boldsymbol{v} = \\lambda \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\lambda$ is a scalar eigenvalue and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is a non-zero eigenvector. The algorithm is to be developed from first principles as specified.\n\nThe core of the RQI method combines two key concepts: the Rayleigh quotient and inverse iteration.\n\n1.  **The Rayleigh Quotient**: For a given real matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and a non-zero vector $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the Rayleigh quotient is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{x}^{T}A\\boldsymbol{x}}{\\boldsymbol{x}^{T}\\boldsymbol{x}}\n    $$\n    This scalar value provides the best approximation of an eigenvalue in a least-squares sense for the given vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$. Specifically, $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is the scalar $\\alpha$ that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\lVert A\\boldsymbol{x} - \\alpha\\boldsymbol{x} \\rVert_2$. If $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is an eigenvector, its Rayleigh quotient $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is exactly the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda$. In our algorithm, since the eigenvector iterate $\\boldsymbol{x}_k$ is always normalized to have a unit Euclidean norm ($\\lVert \\boldsymbol{x}_k \\rVert_2 = 1$), its denominator $\\boldsymbol{x}_k^T \\boldsymbol{x}_k = 1$, simplifying the calculation to $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}_k) = \\boldsymbol{x}_k^T A \\boldsymbol{x}_k$.\n\n2.  **Inverse Iteration with a Dynamic Shift**: The standard inverse iteration method computes iterates via $\\boldsymbol{x}_{k+1} \\propto (A - \\sigma I)^{-1}\\boldsymbol{x}_k$, where $\\sigma$ is a fixed shift. This method converges to the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of $A$ closest to $\\sigma$. RQI is an advanced variant where the shift $\\sigma$ is not fixed but is dynamically updated at each step, using the Rayleigh quotient of the current iterate as the shift for the next step. This choice of shift, $\\sigma_k = \\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}_k)$, typically leads to very rapid (cubic) convergence to an eigenpair.\n\nThe iterative process for RQI can be summarized as follows. Starting with an initial vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_0$, for each iteration $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\na. The current eigenvector approximation is $\\boldsymbol{x}_k$.\nb. An improved eigenvalue approximation (the shift) is computed: $\\mu_k = \\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}_k) = \\boldsymbol{x}_k^T A \\boldsymbol{x}_k$.\nc. A linear system is solved to find a vector enriched in the desired eigenvector direction: $(A - \\mu_k I) \\boldsymbol{y}_{k+1} = \\boldsymbol{x}_k$.\nd. The new eigenvector approximation is obtained by normalizing the solution: $\\boldsymbol{x}_{k+1} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{y}_{k+1}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{y}_{k+1} \\rVert_2}$.\n\nThe complete algorithm, including initialization, termination, and special handling as per the problem requirements, is as follows:\n\n**Algorithm: Rayleigh Quotient Iteration**\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    - Given a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, an initial vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_0$, a tolerance `tol`, and a maximum number of iterations `max_iter`.\n    - Normalize the initial vector: $\\boldsymbol{x} \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{x}_0 / \\lVert \\boldsymbol{x}_0 \\rVert_2$.\n    - Pre-compute the matrix $2$-norm $\\lVert A \\rVert_2$ for potential regularization. The regularization parameter is $\\epsilon = 10^{-14} \\max(1, \\lVert A \\rVert_2)$. Let $I$ be the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\n2.  **Iteration Loop**: For $k$ from $0$ to `max_iter - 1`:\n    a. **Compute Eigenvalue Estimate and Check for Convergence**: Calculate the Rayleigh quotient $\\mu = \\boldsymbol{x}^T A \\boldsymbol{x}$. Check the termination condition by computing the norm of the residual: $r = \\lVert A\\boldsymbol{x} - \\mu\\boldsymbol{x} \\rVert_2$. If $r \\le \\text{tol}$, the algorithm has converged. Terminate and return the final pair $(\\mu, r)$. This step also handles the case of immediate convergence if the initial vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_0$ is already a sufficiently accurate eigenvector.\n\n    b. **Solve the Shifted Linear System**: Form the shifted matrix $M = A - \\mu I$. Solve the linear system $M \\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{x}$ for $\\boldsymbol{y}$. This is performed using a standard direct solver (Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting).\n\n    c. **Handle Singularity**: As $\\mu$ approaches an eigenvalue, the matrix $M$ becomes nearly singular. If the solver fails (e.g., raises a singularity error), the system is regularized. A new system $(M + \\epsilon I) \\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{x}$ is solved instead. This small diagonal shift makes the matrix invertible while minimally perturbing the solution.\n\n    d. **Normalize the Next Iterate**: Update the eigenvector approximation by normalizing the solution vector: $\\boldsymbol{x} \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{y} / \\lVert \\boldsymbol{y} \\rVert_2$.\n\n3.  **Termination**: If the loop completes without meeting the tolerance criterion (i.e., `max_iter` is reached), the algorithm terminates. The final eigenvalue estimate $\\mu$ and residual norm $r$ are calculated based on the last computed vector iterate $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and returned.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic and, for the given test cases, is expected to converge to an eigenvalue closest to the Rayleigh quotient of the initial vector.",
