            "solution": "The problem requires finding the constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ that best approximates a function $f:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ in the continuous least squares sense with respect to a weight function $w:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}$. This is achieved by minimizing the weighted mean-square error, given by the functional $E(c)$:\n$$\nE(c) = \\int_{a}^{b} w(x)\\,\\big(f(x)-c\\big)^{2}\\,dx.\n$$\nTo find the value of $c$ that minimizes $E(c)$, we employ standard methods from calculus. A necessary condition for a minimum is that the derivative of $E(c)$ with respect to $c$ must be zero. Since the integration is with respect to $x$, we can apply the Leibniz integral rule (differentiation under the integral sign) to compute the derivative of $E(c)$ with respect to $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\int_{a}^{b} w(x)\\,\\big(f(x)-c\\big)^{2}\\,dx = \\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\left[ w(x)\\,\\big(f(x)-c\\big)^{2} \\right] \\,dx.\n$$\nUsing the chain rule for the integrand, we find the partial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\left[ w(x)\\,(f(x)-c)^{2} \\right] = w(x) \\cdot 2(f(x)-c) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c}(f(x)-c) = w(x) \\cdot 2(f(x)-c) \\cdot (-1) = -2w(x)(f(x)-c).\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the derivative of $E(c)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dc} = \\int_{a}^{b} -2w(x)(f(x)-c) \\,dx = -2 \\int_{a}^{b} \\big(w(x)f(x) - cw(x)\\big) \\,dx.\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero provides the condition for the optimal $c$:\n$$\n-2 \\int_{a}^{b} \\big(w(x)f(x) - cw(x)\\big) \\,dx = 0.\n$$\nSince $-2 \\neq 0$, the integral itself must be zero:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} \\big(w(x)f(x) - cw(x)\\big) \\,dx = 0.\n$$\nBy the linearity of the integral operator, we can separate the terms:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} w(x)f(x) \\,dx - \\int_{a}^{b} cw(x) \\,dx = 0.\n$$\nSince $c$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $x$, we can factor it out of the second integral:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} w(x)f(x) \\,dx - c \\int_{a}^{b} w(x) \\,dx = 0.\n$$\nSolving for $c$ yields:\n$$\nc \\int_{a}^{b} w(x) \\,dx = \\int_{a}^{b} w(x)f(x) \\,dx.\n$$\nThe problem states that $w(x)$ is a strictly positive weight function, so for $a < b$, the integral $\\int_{a}^{b} w(x) \\,dx$ is positive and non-zero. Thus, we can divide by it to obtain the general expression for the minimizing constant $c$:\n$$\nc = \\frac{\\int_{a}^{b} w(x)f(x) \\,dx}{\\int_{a}^{b} w(x) \\,dx}.\n$$\nTo verify that this value of $c$ corresponds to a minimum, we check the second derivative, $\\frac{d^{2}E}{dc^{2}}$. Differentiating $\\frac{dE}{dc} = -2\\int_{a}^{b} w(x)f(x) \\,dx + 2c\\int_{a}^{b} w(x) \\,dx$ with respect to $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}E}{dc^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left( -2\\int_{a}^{b} w(x)f(x) \\,dx + 2c\\int_{a}^{b} w(x) \\,dx \\right) = 2 \\int_{a}^{b} w(x) \\,dx.\n$$\nAs established, since $w(x) > 0$ on $[a,b]$, the integral $\\int_{a}^{b} w(x) \\,dx$ is positive. Consequently, $\\frac{d^{2}E}{dc^{2}} > 0$, confirming that the critical point is a minimum. Since $E(c)$ is a quadratic in $c$ with a positive leading coefficient, this is a global minimum.\n\nWe now apply this result to the specific case given: $a=1$, $b=e$, $f(x)=\\ln(x)$, and $w(x)=x$. The formula for $c$ is:\n$$\nc = \\frac{\\int_{1}^{e} x \\ln(x) \\,dx}{\\int_{1}^{e} x \\,dx}.\n$$\nWe compute the numerator integral, $\\int_{1}^{e} x \\ln(x) \\,dx$, using integration by parts, $\\int u \\,dv = uv - \\int v \\,du$. Let $u=\\ln(x)$ and $dv=x\\,dx$, which gives $du=\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx$ and $v=\\frac{x^{2}}{2}$.\n$$\n\\int_{1}^{e} x \\ln(x) \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\ln(x) \\right]_{1}^{e} - \\int_{1}^{e} \\frac{x^{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\,dx = \\left( \\frac{e^{2}}{2}\\ln(e) - \\frac{1^{2}}{2}\\ln(1) \\right) - \\int_{1}^{e} \\frac{x}{2} \\,dx.\n$$\nSince $\\ln(e)=1$ and $\\ln(1)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n= \\left( \\frac{e^{2}}{2} - 0 \\right) - \\left[ \\frac{x^{2}}{4} \\right]_{1}^{e} = \\frac{e^{2}}{2} - \\left( \\frac{e^{2}}{4} - \\frac{1^{2}}{4} \\right) = \\frac{e^{2}}{2} - \\frac{e^{2}}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2e^{2}-e^{2}+1}{4} = \\frac{e^{2}+1}{4}.\n$$\nNext, we compute the denominator integral, $\\int_{1}^{e} x \\,dx$:\n$$\n\\int_{1}^{e} x \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^{2}}{2} \\right]_{1}^{e} = \\frac{e^{2}}{2} - \\frac{1^{2}}{2} = \\frac{e^{2}-1}{2}.\n$$\nFinally, we substitute these results back into the expression for $c$:\n$$\nc = \\frac{\\frac{e^{2}+1}{4}}{\\frac{e^{2}-1}{2}} = \\frac{e^{2}+1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{e^{2}-1} = \\frac{e^{2}+1}{2(e^{2}-1)}.\n$$",

The space of functions $C([-1,1])$ is equipped with the inner product $\\langle g, h \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} g(x)h(x)dx$. The best approximation $p^{\\ast}(x)$ is the unique function in $V$ that minimizes the error norm $\\|f - p\\|$, where $\\|g\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle g, g \\rangle}$. This minimum occurs when the residual vector, $r(x) = f(x) - p^{\\ast}(x)$, is orthogonal to the subspace $V$.\n\nAny function $p(x) \\in V$ can be written as a linear combination of the basis functions: $p(x) = c_0 \\cdot 1 + c_1 \\cdot x + c_2 \\cdot x^2$. Let the basis functions be denoted as $\\phi_0(x) = 1$, $\\phi_1(x) = x$, and $\\phi_2(x) = x^2$. The condition that the residual $r(x) = f(x) - p^{\\ast}(x)$ is orthogonal to $V$ means that $r(x)$ must be orthogonal to every basis function of $V$.

The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval $[-a, a]$ is always zero. The product of two even functions or two odd functions is even. The product of an even and an odd function is odd.\nOur function to approximate is $f(x) = x^3$, which is odd.\nThe basis for $V$ consists of $\\phi_0(x) = 1$ (even), $\\phi_1(x) = x$ (odd), and $\\phi_2(x) = x^2$ (even).\n\nThis parity structure affects orthogonality directly. The inner product $\\langle g, h \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} g(x)h(x)dx$ will be zero if the integrand $g(x)h(x)$ is an odd function. This occurs when one of the functions is even and the other is odd. This simplifies the system of normal equations significantly.\n\nLet's compute the required inner products:\nRight-hand side of the normal equations, $\\langle f, \\phi_i \\rangle$:\n$f(x) = x^3$ is odd.\n$\\langle f, \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\langle x^3, 1 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^3 dx = 0$ (integrand is odd).\n$\\langle f, \\phi_1 \\rangle = \\langle x^3, x \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^4 dx = \\left[\\frac{x^5}{5}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{5} - (-\\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n$\\langle f, \\phi_2 \\rangle = \\langle x^3, x^2 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^5 dx = 0$ (integrand is odd).\n\nLeft-hand side matrix elements (Gram matrix), $\\langle \\phi_j, \\phi_i \\rangle$:\n$\\langle \\phi_0, \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\langle 1, 1 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} 1 dx = 2$.\n$\\langle \\phi_0, \\phi_1 \\rangle = \\langle 1, x \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x dx = 0$.\n$\\langle \\phi_0, \\phi_2 \\rangle = \\langle 1, x^2 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 dx = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$\\langle \\phi_1, \\phi_1 \\rangle = \\langle x, x \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 dx = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$\\langle \\phi_1, \\phi_2 \\rangle = \\langle x, x^2 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^3 dx = 0$.\n$\\langle \\phi_2, \\phi_2 \\rangle = \\langle x^2, x^2 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^4 dx = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThe system of equations for the coefficients $(c_0^{\\ast}, c_1^{\\ast}, c_2^{\\ast})$ becomes:\n1. $c_0^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_0, \\phi_0 \\rangle + c_1^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_1, \\phi_0 \\rangle + c_2^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_2, \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\langle f, \\phi_0 \\rangle \\implies c_0^{\\ast}(2) + c_1^{\\ast}(0) + c_2^{\\ast}(\\frac{2}{3}) = 0$.\n2. $c_0^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_0, \\phi_1 \\rangle + c_1^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_1, \\phi_1 \\rangle + c_2^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_2, \\phi_1 \\rangle = \\langle f, \\phi_1 \\rangle \\implies c_0^{\\ast}(0) + c_1^{\\ast}(\\frac{2}{3}) + c_2^{\\ast}(0) = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n3. $c_0^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_0, \\phi_2 \\rangle + c_1^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_1, \\phi_2 \\rangle + c_2^{\\ast}\\langle \\phi_2, \\phi_2 \\rangle = \\langle f, \\phi_2 \\rangle \\implies c_0^{\\ast}(\\frac{2}{3}) + c_1^{\\ast}(0) + c_2^{\\ast}(\\frac{2}{5}) = 0$.\n\nThe system decouples based on parity. The second equation, involving only the odd basis function $\\phi_1$, can be solved independently:\n$\\frac{2}{3} c_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{2}{5} \\implies c_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThe first and third equations form a system for the coefficients of the even basis functions:\n$$ 2c_0^{\\ast} + \\frac{2}{3}c_2^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{2}{3}c_0^{\\ast} + \\frac{2}{5}c_2^{\\ast} = 0 $$\nThis is a homogeneous linear system.

Since the matrix is non-singular, the only solution is the trivial one: $c_0^{\\ast} = 0$ and $c_2^{\\ast} = 0$.\n\nThis illustrates a general principle: the best approximation of an odd function $f$ from a basis consisting of even and odd functions will be composed solely of the odd basis functions. The projection of $f$ onto the subspace of even functions is zero.\nThe coefficients are $c_0^{\\ast}=0$, $c_1^{\\ast}=\\frac{3}{5}$, $c_2^{\\ast}=0$. Thus, the best approximating polynomial is $p^{\\ast}(x) = \\frac{3}{5}x$.\n\nNext, we compute the minimal squared error, $\\|f - p^{\\ast}\\|^2$.\n$\\|f - p^{\\ast}\\|^2 = \\langle f - p^{\\ast}, f - p^{\\ast} \\rangle$.\nBy the construction of $p^{\\ast}$, the residual $f-p^{\\ast}$ is orthogonal to any function in $V$. Since $p^{\\ast} \\in V$, we have $\\langle f - p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast} \\rangle = 0$.\nTherefore, we can expand the squared norm as:\n$\\|f - p^{\\ast}\\|^2 = \\langle f - p^{\\ast}, f \\rangle - \\langle f - p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast} \\rangle = \\langle f, f \\rangle - \\langle p^{\\ast}, f \\rangle$.\n\nWe compute the two required terms:\n$\\|f\\|^2 = \\langle f, f \\rangle = \\langle x^3, x^3 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} x^6 dx = \\left[\\frac{x^7}{7}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{7} - (-\\frac{1}{7}) = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n$\\langle p^{\\ast}, f \\rangle = \\langle \\frac{3}{5}x, x^3 \\rangle = \\frac{3}{5} \\langle x, x^3 \\rangle = \\frac{3}{5} \\int_{-1}^{1} x^4 dx = \\frac{3}{5} \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right) = \\frac{6}{25}$.\n\nThe minimal squared error is:\n$\\|f - p^{\\ast}\\|^2 = \\frac{2}{7} - \\frac{6}{25} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 25}{7 \\cdot 25} - \\frac{6 \\cdot 7}{25 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{50}{175} - \\frac{42}{175} = \\frac{8}{175}$.\nThis fraction is in reduced form since $8=2^3$ and $175=5^2 \\cdot 7$.\nAlternatively, one could directly compute the integral of the squared residual:\n$\\|f - p^{\\ast}\\|^2 = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(x^3 - \\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^2 dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(x^6 - \\frac{6}{5}x^4 + \\frac{9}{25}x^2\\right) dx$.\nSince the integrand is an even function:\n$= 2 \\left[\\frac{x^7}{7} - \\frac{6}{5}\\frac{x^5}{5} + \\frac{9}{25}\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{1} = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{6}{25} + \\frac{3}{25}\\right) = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{3}{25}\\right) = 2 \\left(\\frac{25-21}{175}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{4}{175}\\right) = \\frac{8}{175}$.\nBoth methods yield the same result.

Their orthogonality relation is:\n$$ \\langle P_j, P_k \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} P_j(x) P_k(x) dx = \\frac{2}{2k+1} \\delta_{kj} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{kj}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n- **Gram Matrix:** Since the basis is orthogonal with respect to the specified inner product, the Gram matrix $\\mathbf{G}$ is diagonal.\n- **Ease of Computation:** The coefficients are computed directly via projection integrals: $c_k = \\frac{2k+1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) P_k(x) dx$. No linear system needs to be solved. This is computationally very simple.\n- **Conditioning:** The resulting linear system is perfectly conditioned. If we use the orthonormal Legendre polynomials $\\tilde{P}_k(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k+1}{2}} P_k(x)$, the Gram matrix is the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$, and its condition number is $1$.\n\n**2. Chebyshev Polynomial Basis of the First Kind $\\{T_k(x)\\}$**\nChebyshev polynomials $T_k(x)$ are orthogonal on the interval $[-1, 1]$, but with respect to the weight function $w(x) = (1-x^2)^{-1/2}$. Their orthogonality relation is:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} T_j(x) T_k(x) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx = \\begin{cases} 0 & j \\neq k \\\\ \\pi & j=k=0 \\\\ \\pi/2 & j=k \\neq 0 \\end{cases} $$\nThe problem, however, specifies the weight function $w(x)=1$. We must check for orthogonality with respect to this weight. The inner product is $\\langle T_j, T_k \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} T_j(x) T_k(x) dx$. Let's test a simple case, e.g., $j=0$ and $k=2$. We have $T_0(x)=1$ and $T_2(x)=2x^2-1$.\n$$ \\langle T_0, T_2 \\rangle = \\int_{-1}^{1} (1)(2x^2-1) dx = \\left[ \\frac{2x^3}{3} - x \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}-1\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}+1\\right) = -\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\neq 0 $$\nSince the inner product is non-zero for $j \\neq k$, the Chebyshev basis $\\{T_k(x)\\}$ is **not** orthogonal with respect to the weight function $w(x)=1$.\n- **Gram Matrix:** The Gram matrix is **not** diagonal. It will be a full (or at least non-diagonal) matrix, requiring a general-purpose linear solver.\n- **Ease of Computation:** The coefficients $c_k$ must be found by solving the full linear system $\\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$. This is significantly more complex and computationally expensive than the direct projection for the Legendre basis.\n- **Conditioning:** Because the basis is not orthogonal, the Gram matrix will be more ill-conditioned than the diagonal matrix obtained with the Legendre basis. While better conditioned than the monomial basis $\\{x^k\\}$, it is suboptimal for this specific problem.\n\n**Conclusion:** For the continuous least squares problem on $[-1, 1]$ with $w(x)=1$, the Legendre basis is the superior choice. It is orthogonal with respect to the problem's inner product, leading to a diagonal Gram matrix, trivial coefficient computation, and optimal conditioning. The Chebyshev basis lacks this orthogonality, making it computationally more difficult and numerically less stable for this specific task.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The Legendre basis $\\{P_k(x)\\}$ is orthogonal on $[-1,1]$ under $w(x)=1$, so the Gram matrix is diagonal (and can be made the identity by normalizing), making coefficients simple to compute by projection integrals and yielding the best conditioning among the two choices.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. The Legendre basis is orthogonal for $w(x)=1$, which makes the Gram matrix diagonal. This simplifies coefficient calculation to direct projection and provides the best possible conditioning.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The Chebyshev basis $\\{T_k(x)\\}$ is orthogonal on $[-1,1]$ for any weight function, so its Gram matrix is diagonal for $w(x)=1$, which both simplifies coefficient computation and improves conditioning compared to the Legendre basis.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, no basis is orthogonal for \"any\" weight function. Second, the Chebyshev basis is not orthogonal for $w(x)=1$. Consequently, its Gram matrix is not diagonal, coefficient computation is not simplified, and its conditioning is worse than that of the Legendre basis for this problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Both Legendre and Chebyshev bases are equally orthogonal under $w(x)=1$ and therefore yield identical Gram matrices, identical ease of coefficient computation, and identical conditioning.**\nThis statement is false. Only the Legendre basis is orthogonal under $w(x)=1$. The Chebyshev basis is not. Their properties in this context are distinctly different.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The Chebyshev basis $\\{T_k(x)\\}$ should be preferred because, even if it is not orthogonal under $w(x)=1$, its near-minimax approximation property ensures the normal equations matrix has better conditioning and makes coefficients easier to compute than with Legendre polynomials.**\nThis statement is incorrect and misleading. The near-minimax property of Chebyshev polynomials relates to the $L^\\infty$ norm, which is not the norm being minimized in this $L^2$ (least squares) problem. For the $L^2$ norm with $w(x)=1$, the key property is orthogonality with respect to $w(x)=1$. Since the Chebyshev basis lacks this property, it makes the coefficients *harder* to compute (requiring a linear system solve) and leads to *worse* conditioning compared to the orthogonal Legendre basis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
