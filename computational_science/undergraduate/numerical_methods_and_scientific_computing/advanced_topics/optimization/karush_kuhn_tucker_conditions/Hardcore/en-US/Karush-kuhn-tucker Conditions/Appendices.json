This practice moves beyond simply verifying a given point and asks you to find all candidate solutions for a problem defined on a closed interval .

This advanced exercise is designed to correct that notion by demonstrating that the KKT conditions are necessary, but not always sufficient, for optimality .

            "solution": "**1. Problem Formulation**\nThe problem is to minimize $f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}$ subject to the constraint $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2} \\leq 1$. We can write this in standard form with the constraint function $g(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}-1 \\leq 0$. Both $f$ and $g$ are continuously differentiable.\n\n**2. Constraint Qualification**\nThe Linear Independence Constraint Qualification (LICQ) holds at all feasible points. For any point on the boundary where $g(x) = 0$, the gradient $\\nabla g(x) = (2x_1, 2x_2)$ is non-zero (since $x_1$ and $x_2$ cannot both be zero). For interior points where $g(x)  0$, the condition is vacuously satisfied. Thus, any local minimum must satisfy the KKT conditions.\n\n**3. KKT Conditions**\nThe Lagrangian is $L(x_1, x_2, \\mu) = (x_1^2 - x_2^2) + \\mu(x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1)$. The KKT conditions for a point to be a local minimizer are:\n- **Stationarity**:\n  $\\nabla_x L = 0 \\implies$\n  $2x_1 + 2\\mu x_1 = 2x_1(1+\\mu) = 0$\n  $-2x_2 + 2\\mu x_2 = 2x_2(\\mu-1) = 0$\n- **Primal Feasibility**: $x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1 \\le 0$\n- **Dual Feasibility**: $\\mu \\ge 0$\n- **Complementary Slackness**: $\\mu(x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1) = 0$\n\n**4. Solving for KKT Points**\nWe analyze two cases based on complementary slackness.\n\n- **Case 1: Interior solution ($x_1^2+x_2^2-1  0$)**\n    Complementary slackness implies $\\mu=0$. The stationarity conditions simplify to:\n    $2x_1 = 0 \\implies x_1 = 0$\n    $-2x_2 = 0 \\implies x_2 = 0$\n    This gives the candidate point $(0,0)$. This point is feasible ($0^2+0^2-1  0$). All KKT conditions are satisfied for $(0,0)$ with $\\mu=0$.\n\n- **Case 2: Boundary solution ($x_1^2+x_2^2-1 = 0$)**\n    This requires $\\mu \\ge 0$. The stationarity conditions are $2x_1(1+\\mu)=0$ and $2x_2(\\mu-1)=0$.\n    Since $\\mu \\ge 0$, we have $1+\\mu > 0$. The first equation $2x_1(1+\\mu)=0$ forces $x_1=0$.\n    Substituting $x_1=0$ into the boundary condition gives $x_2^2 = 1$, so $x_2 = \\pm 1$.\n    The second stationarity equation $2x_2(\\mu-1)=0$ must hold. Since $x_2 \\neq 0$, we must have $\\mu-1=0$, which gives $\\mu=1$. This satisfies $\\mu \\ge 0$.\n    This case yields two KKT points: $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$, both with $\\mu=1$.\n\nThe set of all KKT points is $\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,-1)\\}$.\n\n**5. Classification of KKT Points**\nWe need to find a KKT point that is not a local minimum. Let's analyze the point $(0,0)$.\nThe function value is $f(0,0) = 0$.\nConsider perturbations around this point:\n- Along the $x_1$-axis, for a small $h \\neq 0$, the point $(h,0)$ is feasible. The function value is $f(h,0) = h^2 - 0^2 = h^2 > 0 = f(0,0)$.\n- Along the $x_2$-axis, for a small $k \\neq 0$, the point $(0,k)$ is feasible. The function value is $f(0,k) = 0^2 - k^2 = -k^2  0 = f(0,0)$.\nSince there are feasible points arbitrarily close to $(0,0)$ where the function value is smaller than $f(0,0)$, the point $(0,0)$ is not a local minimum. It is a saddle point.\n\nThe points $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$ are the global minima, as $f(0,\\pm 1)=-1$.\n\nTherefore, $(0,0)$ is a feasible point that satisfies the KKT conditions but is not a local minimum.",
