            "problem": "In the field of numerical optimization, line search algorithms are fundamental for determining an appropriate step size during an iterative process to minimize a function. One of the most common methods is the backtracking line search, which aims to find a step size $\\alpha > 0$ that provides a sufficient decrease in the objective function. This is often enforced by the Armijo condition.\n\nThe Armijo condition is given by the inequality:\n$$f(x_k + \\alpha p_k) \\le f(x_k) + c_1 \\alpha \\nabla f(x_k)^T p_k$$\nHere, $f$ is the objective function, $x_k$ is the current iterate, $p_k$ is the search direction, $\\nabla f(x_k)$ is the gradient of the function at $x_k$, and $c_1$ is a constant controlling the required decrease, typically chosen in the range $(0, 1)$.\n\nThe backtracking algorithm operates as follows:\n1.  Begin with an initial trial step size, $\\alpha = \\bar{\\alpha}$.\n2.  Check if the Armijo condition is satisfied for the current $\\alpha$.\n3.  If the condition is not met, reduce the step size by a backtracking factor $\\rho \\in (0, 1)$ such that the new step size becomes $\\alpha \\leftarrow \\rho \\alpha$.\n4.  Repeat from step 2 until an acceptable $\\alpha$ is found.\n\nConsider the optimization of the one-dimensional objective function $f(x) = x^4$. We are at the current iterate $x_k = 1$ and have chosen a descent direction $p_k = -1$. The parameters for the backtracking line search are configured as follows:\n- Initial trial step size: $\\bar{\\alpha} = 1$\n- Sufficient decrease constant: $c_1 = 0.8$\n- Backtracking factor: $\\rho = 0.5$\n\nYour task is to execute the backtracking line search procedure and determine the first accepted step size $\\alpha$.",

The objective function is the two-dimensional Rosenbrock function defined for a vector $x = (x_1, x_2)$ as $f(x) = (1 - x_1)^2 + 100 (x_2 - x_1^2)^2$. The algorithm must use a principled line search based on conditions that ensure sufficient decrease and appropriate curvature along a descent direction, and it must be capable of falling back to a simple backtracking strategy when the primary line search fails to find a step length.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a steepest-descent optimization algorithm for the two-dimensional Rosenbrock function, incorporating a sophisticated line search procedure. The solution is presented by first detailing the mathematical principles and then describing the algorithmic components.\n\n### 1. Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe objective function is the Rosenbrock function, a standard benchmark for optimization algorithms known for its narrow, parabolic valley. For a vector $x = (x_1, x_2)$, it is defined as:\n$$\nf(x) = (1 - x_1)^2 + 100(x_2 - x_1^2)^2\n$$\nTo implement a gradient-based method like steepest descent, we must compute the gradient of $f(x)$, denoted by $\\nabla f(x)$. The partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} = -2(1 - x_1) + 100 \\cdot 2(x_2 - x_1^2) \\cdot (-2x_1) = -2(1 - x_1) - 400x_1(x_2 - x_1^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} = 100 \\cdot 2(x_2 - x_1^2) = 200(x_2 - x_1^2)\n$$\nThus, the gradient vector is:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2(1 - x_1) - 400x_1(x_2 - x_1^2) \\\\ 200(x_2 - x_1^2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n### 2. Steepest-Descent Algorithm\n\nThe steepest-descent method is an iterative algorithm that seeks a local minimum of a function. Starting from an initial point $x_0$, it generates a sequence of points $\\{x_k\\}$ using the update rule:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = x_k + \\alpha_k p_k\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the iteration index, $p_k$ is the search direction, and $\\alpha_k  0$ is the step length. For the steepest-descent method, the search direction is chosen to be the direction of most rapid decrease, which is the negative of the gradient:\n$$\np_k = - \\nabla f(x_k)\n$$\nThe iterations continue until a termination criterion is met. In this problem, the process halts if the Euclidean norm of the gradient falls below a specified tolerance, $\\lVert \\nabla f(x_k) \\rVert_2  \\text{tolerance}$, or if the number of iterations reaches a maximum value, $k \\ge \\text{max\\_iterations}$.\n\n### 3. The Line Search Subproblem and Wolfe Conditions\n\nA crucial part of the algorithm is determining the step length $\\alpha_k$ at each iteration. This is a one-dimensional optimization problem: find an $\\alpha_k$ that minimizes the function along the search direction, $\\phi(\\alpha) = f(x_k + \\alpha p_k)$. Instead of finding the exact minimum, it is more efficient to find an $\\alpha_k$ that provides sufficient progress. The strong Wolfe conditions provide a standard and effective way to ensure this.\n\nThe **strong Wolfe conditions** consist of two inequalities that the step length $\\alpha$ must satisfy:\n1.  **Sufficient Decrease Condition (Armijo condition):**\n    $$\n    f(x_k + \\alpha p_k) \\le f(x_k) + c_1 \\alpha \\nabla f(x_k)^T p_k\n    $$\n    This condition ensures that the step length $\\alpha$ achieves a sufficient decrease in the objective function $f$. Here, $c_1$ is a constant, typically small, e.g., $c_1 = 10^{-4}$.\n\n2.  **Curvature Condition:**\n    $$\n    |\\nabla f(x_k + \\alpha p_k)^T p_k| \\le c_2 |\\nabla f(x_k)^T p_k|\n    $$\n    This condition ensures that the slope of the function at the new point is sufficiently reduced, which prevents the algorithm from taking excessively small steps. The parameter $c_2$ satisfies $c_1  c_2  1$. For descent directions, $\\nabla f(x_k)^T p_k  0$, so the condition can be written as $|\\nabla f(x_k + \\alpha p_k)^T p_k| \\le -c_2 \\nabla f(x_k)^T p_k$.\n\n### 4. Line Search Implementation\n\nA robust line search algorithm that finds a step length satisfying the strong Wolfe conditions typically involves a two-stage process: a bracketing stage followed by a zooming stage.\n\n1.  **Bracketing**: Starting with an initial guess for $\\alpha$, the algorithm generates a sequence of trial step lengths, expanding a search interval until it brackets one or more points satisfying the Wolfe conditions.\n2.  **Zooming**: Once an interval $[\\alpha_{\\text{lo}}, \\alpha_{\\text{hi}}]$ is identified that is known to contain a suitable step length, a procedure (e.g., bisection or interpolation) is used to zoom in on a point within this interval that satisfies the strong Wolfe conditions.\n\nThe implementation will include an internal iteration limit for this search. If a suitable $\\alpha$ is not found within this limit, the line search is considered to have \"failed,\" triggering the fallback mechanism.\n\n### 5. Fallback Strategy: Armijo Backtracking\n\nIf the primary strong Wolfe line search fails, the algorithm falls back to a simpler but more robust method: Armijo backtracking. This method guarantees that only the sufficient decrease condition is met. The algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  Start with an initial step length, e.g., $\\alpha = \\alpha_0$.\n2.  While the sufficient decrease condition is not satisfied:\n    $$\n    f(x_k + \\alpha p_k)  f(x_k) + c_1 \\alpha \\nabla f(x_k)^T p_k\n    $$\n    reduce the step length by a factor $\\tau \\in (0, 1)$:\n    $$\n    \\alpha \\leftarrow \\tau \\alpha\n    $$\n3.  The process stops when the condition is met or if $\\alpha$ becomes smaller than a minimum threshold $\\alpha_{\\min}$.\n\n### 6. Summary of the Complete Algorithm\n\nThe final program integrates these components for each specified test case:\n\n1.  Initialize the starting point $x_0$ and parameters ($c_1, c_2, \\alpha_0, \\text{max\\_iterations}, \\text{tolerance}$).\n2.  Begin the main loop for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, \\text{max\\_iterations}-1$.\n3.  At each iteration $k$, compute the gradient $\\nabla f(x_k)$ and its norm. If the norm is below the tolerance, terminate and return the sequence of step lengths found so far.\n4.  Set the search direction $p_k = - \\nabla f(x_k)$.\n5.  Call the strong Wolfe line search function with an initial guess $\\alpha_0$ to find the step length $\\alpha_k$.\n6.  If the Wolfe search fails (returns a failure signal), call the Armijo backtracking function to find $\\alpha_k$. The starting $\\alpha$ for backtracking is the initial guess for the current iteration.\n7.  Store the computed step length $\\alpha_k$.\n8.  Update the position: $x_{k+1} = x_k + \\alpha_k p_k$.\n9.  After the loop terminates (either by convergence or max iterations), output the lists of all stored $\\alpha_k$ values for each test case in the specified format. The starting point $x_0 = (1.0, 1.0)$ in Test Case 3 is the global minimizer, so the gradient norm is $0$, leading to immediate termination and an empty list of step lengths.",
