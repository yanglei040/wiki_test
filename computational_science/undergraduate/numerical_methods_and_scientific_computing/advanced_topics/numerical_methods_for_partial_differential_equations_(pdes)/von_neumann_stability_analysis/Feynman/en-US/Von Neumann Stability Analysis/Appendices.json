            "introduction": "Our journey into hands-on stability analysis begins with a cautionary tale. The Forward-Time, Centered-Space (FTCS) scheme is often the first method one might devise for the advection equation, as it seems a direct translation of the partial derivatives. However, this intuition is misleading, as the scheme is unconditionally unstable. This exercise goes beyond simply proving instability; you will use von Neumann analysis to diagnose the problem by identifying the specific error modes that amplify most rapidly, a key skill in debugging numerical simulations .",

They employ the Forward-in-Time, Centered-in-Space (FTCS) scheme, which is given by the following finite difference equation:\n$$ \\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t} + c \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n}{2\\Delta x} = 0 $$\nwhere $u_j^n$ is the numerical approximation of $u(j\\Delta x, n\\Delta t)$.\n\nThis scheme is known to be unconditionally unstable, causing any initial round-off errors to grow over time. The error can be decomposed into a superposition of Fourier modes. The evolution of a single Fourier mode with wavenumber $k$ from one time step to the next is governed by a complex amplification factor, $G(k)$. The mode that corresponds to the largest magnitude of this factor, $|G(k)|$, will grow most rapidly and eventually dominate the numerical solution.\n\nYour task is to identify the specific wavenumber $k$ of the Fourier mode that experiences the fastest growth.
