We are to analyze the stability of the Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS) discretization scheme for this equation.\n\nLet us define a uniform grid with spatial step $\\Delta x$ and time step $\\Delta t$. The temperature at a grid node $i$ and time level $n$ is denoted by $T_i^n \\equiv T(i\\Delta x, n\\Delta t)$.\n\nThe FTCS scheme approximates the partial derivatives as follows:\nThe time derivative is approximated using a first-order forward difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\bigg|_{i,n} \\approx \\frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe spatial second derivative is approximated using a second-order central difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\bigg|_{i,n} \\approx \\frac{T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the governing equation gives the discretized form of the FTCS scheme:\n$$\n\\frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right)\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve explicitly for the temperature at the next time step, $T_i^{n+1}$:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} (T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n)\n$$\nLet us define the dimensionless Fourier number, $Fo$, also known as the diffusion number, as:\n$$\nFo = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nThe discretized equation simplifies to:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + Fo (T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n) = Fo \\, T_{i+1}^n + (1 - 2Fo)T_i^n + Fo \\, T_{i-1}^n\n$$\nTo determine the stability of this numerical scheme, we perform a von Neumann stability analysis. We consider the behavior of a single Fourier mode of the solution. Let the temperature distribution at time level $n$ be represented by a Fourier component:\n$$\nT_i^n = \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{i k x_i}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the wavenumber, $x_i = i\\Delta x$ is the spatial position of node $i$, and $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit. The amplitude of this mode at time $n$ is $\\hat{T}^n(k)$. After one time step, this mode will be amplified by a factor $G(k)$, the amplification factor:\n$$\nT_i^{n+1} = \\hat{T}^{n+1}(k) e^{i k x_i} = G(k) \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{i k x_i}\n$$\nFor the numerical scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any wavenumber $k$. The stability condition is:\n$$\n|G(k)| \\le 1\n$$\nWe substitute the Fourier mode representation into the discretized equation:\n$$\nG(k) \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{i k (i\\Delta x)} = Fo \\, \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{i k ((i+1)\\Delta x)} + (1 - 2Fo) \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{i k (i\\Delta x)} + Fo \\, \\hat{T}^n(k) e^{i k ((i-1)\\Delta x)}\n$$\nDividing by $\\hat{T}^n(k) e^{i k (i\\Delta x)}$ yields the expression for the amplification factor $G(k)$:\n$$\nG(k) = Fo \\, e^{i k \\Delta x} + (1 - 2Fo) + Fo \\, e^{-i k \\Delta x}\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$\nG(k) = 1 - 2Fo + Fo (e^{i k \\Delta x} + e^{-i k \\Delta x}) = 1 - 2Fo + 2Fo \\cos(k \\Delta x)\n$$\n$$\nG(k) = 1 - 2Fo(1 - \\cos(k \\Delta x))\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, we obtain:\n$$\nG(k) = 1 - 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nNow we apply the stability condition $|G(k)| \\le 1$. Since $Fo > 0$, the term $4Fo \\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)$ is non-negative. Therefore, $G(k)$ is always less than or equal to $1$. The stability is thus governed by the lower bound:\n$$\nG(k) \\ge -1\n$$\n$$\n1 - 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\ge -1\n$$\n$$\n2 \\ge 4Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\ge Fo \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all possible wavenumbers $k$. The most restrictive condition occurs when the term $\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)$ reaches its maximum value. The maximum value of $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is $1$. This corresponds to the highest frequency (most rapidly oscillating) mode representable on the grid, where $k \\Delta x = \\pi$.\nThus, the condition for stability becomes:\n$$\nFo \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nMarginal stability is achieved at the limit of this condition, where $Fo = 1/2$.

            "solution": "The one-dimensional heat equation $u_t = \\alpha u_{xx}$ models diffusive smoothing. For a uniform grid $x_i = i \\Delta x$ with $i = 0,\\dots,N_x-1$ and time levels $t^n = n \\Delta t$, the explicit forward-time and second-order central-space scheme follows from the definitions of the time derivative and second derivative. The time derivative is approximated by the forward difference $u_t(x_i,t^n) \\approx \\left(u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n\\right)/\\Delta t$, and the second derivative by the central difference $u_{xx}(x_i,t^n) \\approx \\left(u_{i+1}^n - 2 u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n\\right)/(\\Delta x)^2$. Equating these approximations yields the explicit update\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + r \\left(u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n\\right), \\quad r = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2},\n$$\nfor interior indices $i = 1,\\dots,N_x-2$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions $u_0^n = 0$ and $u_{N_x-1}^n = 0$ for all $n$.\n\nPrinciple-based stability analysis uses the Von Neumann method for linear constant-coefficient schemes. Consider a Fourier mode $e^{\\mathrm{i} k x_i}$ and write the amplification factor $g(k)$ such that $u_i^{n+1} = g(k) u_i^n$ for that mode. Substituting the central difference yields\n$$\ng(k) = 1 - 4 r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right).\n$$\nStability in the sense of bounded amplification for all modes requires $\\lvert g(k) \\rvert \\le 1$ for all wavenumbers $k$. The most restrictive case is when $\\sin^2\\left(k \\Delta x/2\\right) = 1$, which yields the condition\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 - 4r \\le 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r \\le \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThus the explicit forward-time central-space scheme is stable if and only if $r \\le 1/2$. The scheme is first-order accurate in time ($\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$ truncation error) and second-order accurate in space ($\\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^2)$ truncation error). If one keeps $r$ fixed when refining the grid, then $\\Delta t$ scales like $(\\Delta x)^2$, and both temporal and spatial errors scale as $\\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^2)$, with overall error behaving like $\\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^2)$. Under this coupling, halving $\\Delta x$ reduces the error by a factor of approximately $4$.\n\nEfficiency considerations for the explicit method are straightforward: each time step updates $N_x-2$ interior points and involves a constant amount of arithmetic per point, so the computational work proxy $W$ scales like $W = N_t \\cdot (N_x - 2)$, where $N_t$ is the number of time steps. For fixed $r$ and final time $T$, we have $\\Delta t = r (\\Delta x)^2/\\alpha$ and $N_t \\approx T/\\Delta t \\propto 1/(\\Delta x)^2$. Consequently, the total work scales like $W \\propto (N_x-2) \\cdot 1/(\\Delta x)^2 \\sim \\mathcal{O}(N_x^3)$ for one-dimensional uniform grids (since $N_x \\sim 1/\\Delta x$), reflecting the parabolic restriction on the time step for explicit schemes.\n\nThe program implements the explicit scheme with $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$ and Dirichlet boundaries, evolves to the final time $T$ for specified $\\alpha$, $N_x$, and $r$, and measures observational stability by monitoring the maximum norm over time. It computes the infinity-norm error at the last simulated time using the exact solution $u(x,t) = e^{-\\alpha \\pi^2 t} \\sin(\\pi x)$. The stability verification compares the observed classification with the theoretical classification based on $r$ and outputs booleans per test case. For accuracy assessment, it computes the error ratio $E_{\\text{coarse}}/E_{\\text{fine}}$ under the stable coupling $r = 0.45$, $N_x = 51$ versus $N_x = 101$, expecting a ratio near $4$, consistent with second-order accuracy in space and the coupled first-order in time with $\\Delta t \\propto (\\Delta x)^2$.\n\nThe final output is a single line in the format \"[b1,b2,b3,ratio]\", where $b1$, $b2$, and $b3$ are booleans for the cases $r = 0.45$, $r = 0.5$, and $r = 0.55$, respectively, and \"ratio\" is the floating-point value of $E_{\\text{coarse}}/E_{\\text{fine}}$.",

We denote the numerical approximation of the solution $u(x_j, n\\Delta t)$ as $u_j^n$.\n\nThe time derivative $u_t$ at $(x_j, t_n)$ is approximated using a first-order forward difference:\n$$\nu_t \\approx \\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe second spatial derivative $u_{xx}$ is approximated using a second-order central difference:\n$$\nu_{xx} \\approx \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the diffusion equation $u_t = \\alpha u_{xx}$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the solution at the next time step, $u_j^{n+1}$, gives the explicit FTCS update rule:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2} \\left( u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n \\right)\n$$\nWe define the dimensionless diffusion number, $r = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}$. The update rule simplifies to:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n + r \\left( u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n \\right)\n$$\nThis equation is applied to all interior grid points, i.e., for $j = 1, 2, \\dots, M-1$. The boundary conditions dictate that $u_0^n = 0$ and $u_M^n = 0$ for all time levels $n$.\n\nThe problem specifies an initial condition $u(x,0)$ composed of the highest frequency discrete sine mode representable on the grid that satisfies the boundary conditions. This mode corresponds to an index $m = M-1$, given by $u_j^0 = \\sin((M-1)\\pi x_j)$ for $j=1,\\dots,M-1$. This mode is chosen because it represents the most challenging case for the stability of the numerical scheme. The values at the boundaries are $u_0^0 = \\sin(0) = 0$ and $u_M^0 = \\sin((M-1)\\pi \\cdot M/M) = \\sin((M-1)\\pi) = 0$, satisfying the Dirichlet conditions.\n\nA crucial aspect of explicit schemes like FTCS is conditional stability. A von Neumann stability analysis shows that the FTCS scheme for the diffusion equation is stable only if $r \\le 1/2$. For an initial condition containing multiple frequency modes, if $r > 1/2$, the high-frequency components experience amplification in each time step, leading to catastrophic, unphysical growth of the numerical solution. The stability condition for a specific discrete mode with index $m$ is $r \\le \\frac{1}{2 \\sin^2(m\\pi / (2M))}$. The most restrictive condition comes from the highest frequency mode, $m=M-1$, yielding a critical value $r_c = \\frac{1}{2 \\sin^2((M-1)\\pi / (2M))}$. For large $M$, $\\sin^2((M-1)\\pi / (2M)) \\approx 1$, so $r_c \\approx 0.5$. The provided test cases with $r=0.49$, $r=0.50$, and $r=0.51$ are designed to probe this stability boundary. For $M=64$, the critical value is $r_c \\approx 0.50096$. We therefore expect decay (stability) for $r \\le 0.50$ and growth (instability) for $r = 0.51$.\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n1.  For each test case $(M, N_t, r)$, initialize the constants $\\alpha=1$ and the grid. The spatial step is $\\Delta x = 1/M$.\n2.  Create an array `u` of size $M+1$ to store the solution at a given time step.\n3.  Set the initial condition: $u_j^0 = \\sin((M-1)\\pi x_j) = \\sin((M-1)\\pi j \\Delta x)$ for $j=1, \\dots, M-1$. The boundary points $u_0^0$ and $u_M^0$ are zero.\n4.  Calculate the initial discrete infinity-norm, $N_0 = \\max_{0 \\le j \\le M} |u_j^0|$.\n5.  Iterate for $N_t$ time steps. In each step, compute the next state $u^{n+1}$ from the current state $u^n$ using the FTCS update rule for all interior points. A copy of the solution at step $n$ must be used to calculate all values for step $n+1$ before updating the solution array.\n6.  After $N_t$ steps, calculate the final discrete infinity-norm, $N_{final} = \\max_{0 \\le j \\le M} |u_j^{N_t}|$.\n7.  Compute the required ratio $R = N_{final} / N_0$.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for all four test cases. The implementation will use vectorized `numpy` operations for efficiency.",
