            "problem": "A digital control system for a simplified industrial process is being designed. The system relies on four binary sensor inputs, labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. An output signal, $F$, must be asserted (go to logical HIGH) if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:\n- Condition 1: Sensor $A$ is active, AND (Sensor $A$ is active OR Sensor $B$ is active).\n- Condition 2: Sensor $C$ is active, AND (Sensor $C$ is active OR Sensor $D$ is active).\n\nYour task is to analyze this logic. First, determine the algebraically minimized Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression for the function $F$. Second, determine the absolute minimum number of 2-input NOR gates required to build a circuit that implements this minimized function.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly provides both the minimized function and the minimum number of required 2-input NOR gates?\n\nA.

            "solution": "Define the logic function from the stated conditions. Condition 1 is \"Sensor $A$ is active, AND (Sensor $A$ is active OR Sensor $B$ is active),\" which translates to $A(A+B)$. Condition 2 is \"Sensor $C$ is active, AND (Sensor $C$ is active OR Sensor $D$ is active),\" which translates to $C(C+D)$. The output is asserted if and only if at least one condition is true, so the function is\n$$\nF=A(A+B)+C(C+D).\n$$\nSimplify each term using the absorption/idempotent laws of Boolean algebra. Specifically, use $X(X+Y)=X$:\n$$\nA(A+B)=A,\\quad C(C+D)=C.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nF=A+C.\n$$\nThis is already an algebraically minimized Sum-of-Products expression.\n\nNext, determine the absolute minimum number of 2-input NOR gates to implement $F=A+C$ using only 2-input NOR gates. A 2-input NOR gate realizes $(X+Y)'$. To obtain an OR from NOR gates, express\n$$\nF=A+C=\\left((A+C)'\\right)'.\n$$\nThis can be implemented with two 2-input NOR gates as follows:\n- First gate: $N_{1}=A \\downarrow C=(A+C)'$.\n- Second gate (self-NOR to invert): $F=N_{1} \\downarrow N_{1}=\\left(N_{1}+N_{1}\\right)'=\\left((A+C)'\\right)'=A+C$.\nA single 2-input NOR gate cannot directly produce $A+C$ (it produces $(A+C)'$), so at least one additional NOR gate is required to invert the result. Hence the absolute minimum is two 2-input NOR gates.\n\nThus, the correct option is the one stating the minimized function $F=A+C$ and the number of NOR gates as $2$.",

            "problem": "In digital circuit design, optimizing logic functions is crucial for reducing cost, power consumption, and propagation delay. A common metric for optimization is the literal count, where a literal is a single variable or its complement (e.g., $X$ or $X'$).\n\nConsider a 4-variable logic function, $F(W,X,Y,Z)$, which is defined by its set of maxterms as:\n$$F(W,X,Y,Z) = \\Pi M(0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15)$$\nYour task is to find a simplified representation of this function.

            "problem": "A digital combinational block in a processor’s control path generates an output described by a three-variable Boolean function $f(A,B,C)$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are binary-valued signals. The function is specified in canonical sum-of-minterms form as “$f$ is $1$” at minterm indices $\\{1,3,6,7\\}$ and “$f$ is $0$” elsewhere, using the conventional indexing $m_{0}=000$, $m_{1}=001$, $m_{2}=010$, $m_{3}=011$, $m_{4}=100$, $m_{5}=101$, $m_{6}=110$, $m_{7}=111$. The target is to analyze and modify the implementation so that the output does not glitch when a single input toggles while the others are held fixed.\n\nStarting from the foundational definitions of Boolean algebra and the adjacency structure of the Karnaugh map (K-map), construct the K-map for $f$, derive a minimized sum-of-products realization using only prime implicants, and determine whether this minimized realization exhibits a static-$1$ hazard under any single-variable transition. If a static-$1$ hazard is present, use K-map adjacency reasoning to add the minimum set of consensus term(s) that eliminate the hazard without altering the truth table of $f$.\n\nProvide, as your final answer, a single closed-form hazard-free sum-of-products expression for $f(A,B,C)$. No numerical rounding is required, and no units apply. Your answer must be a single symbolic expression.",
            "solution": "The specified Boolean function is given in canonical sum-of-minterms form as $f(A,B,C) = \\sum m(1, 3, 6, 7)$. The minterm indices correspond to the binary values of the input variables $(A,B,C)$ for which the function's output is $1$. The minterms are:\n-   $m_1$: $(A,B,C)=(0,0,1)$, which corresponds to the product term $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}C$.\n-   $m_3$: $(A,B,C)=(0,1,1)$, which corresponds to the product term $\\overline{A}BC$.\n-   $m_6$: $(A,B,C)=(1,1,0)$, which corresponds to the product term $AB\\overline{C}$.\n-   $m_7$: $(A,B,C)=(1,1,1)$, which corresponds to the product term $ABC$.\n\nThe full canonical sum-of-products expression is $f(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}C + \\overline{A}BC + AB\\overline{C} + ABC$.\n\nTo simplify this function and analyze it for hazards, we construct a 3-variable Karnaugh map (K-map). The K-map for $f(A,B,C)$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\n\\multicolumn{1}{r}{A \\backslash BC} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{00} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{01} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{11} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10} \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n0 & 0 & 1_{m_1} & 1_{m_3} & 0 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1_{m_7} & 1_{m_6} \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe next step is to find the minimal sum-of-products expression by grouping adjacent $1$s to form prime implicants.\n1.  The grouping of $(m_1, m_3)$ corresponds to $A=0$ and $C=1$, which yields the prime implicant $\\overline{A}C$. This is an essential prime implicant as it is the only one covering $m_1$.\n2.  The grouping of $(m_6, m_7)$ corresponds to $A=1$ and $B=1$, which yields the prime implicant $AB$. This is an essential prime implicant as it is the only one covering $m_6$.\n\nThe two essential prime implicants, $\\overline{A}C$ and $AB$, cover all the $1$s of the function. Therefore, the minimal sum-of-products expression is:\n$$f_{min}(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}C + AB$$\nNow, we must analyze this minimal realization for static hazards. A static-$1$ hazard can occur when a single input variable changes, causing a transition between two states where the output is $1$, but the two states are covered by different product terms in the SOP expression. On the K-map, this corresponds to an adjacency between two $1$s that is not spanned by a single prime implicant in the chosen cover.\n\nThe minterm $m_3$ is $(0,1,1)$ and $m_7$ is $(1,1,1)$. They are adjacent, differing only in variable $A$. In our minimal expression $f_{min} = \\overline{A}C + AB$, $m_3$ is covered by $\\overline{A}C$ and $m_7$ is covered by $AB$. Since they are covered by two different terms, a static-$1$ hazard exists for the transition where $B=1, C=1$ and $A$ toggles. During this transition, due to gate delays, it is possible for both terms to be momentarily $0$, causing a $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$ glitch at the output.\n\nTo eliminate this hazard, we must add a redundant product term that covers the adjacency between $m_3$ and $m_7$. This term is known as the consensus term. The consensus of $\\overline{A}C$ and $AB$ is $BC$. On the K-map, this corresponds to grouping $m_3$ and $m_7$. For this group, $B=1, C=1$ and $A$ varies, yielding the term $BC$.\n\nAdding this redundant term does not change the logical function, since its minterms ($m_3$ and $m_7$) are already covered. The inclusion of this term ensures that when $A$ changes while $B=1$ and $C=1$, the output is held at $1$ by the term $BC$, which is independent of $A$.\n\nThe resulting hazard-free sum-of-products expression is:\n$$f_{hazard-free}(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}C + AB + BC$$\nThis expression covers all single-variable transitions between states where $f=1$ with a common product term, thus guaranteeing a glitch-free output. Reordering the terms for convention gives $AB + \\overline{A}C + BC$.",
