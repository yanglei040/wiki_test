            "problem": "A digital logic function $F$ with three input variables $A$, $B$, and $C$ is specified using its canonical Sum of Products (SOP) form. The function is defined by the set of minterms for which its output is true (1): $F(A,B,C) = \\sum m(0, 1, 2, 3)$. The variables are ordered such that $A$ is the Most Significant Bit (MSB). Find the minimal standard SOP expression that is logically equivalent to this function.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the simplification of a given Boolean function in its canonical Sum of Products (SOP) form. The function is $F(A,B,C) = \\sum m(0, 1, 2, 3)$.\n\nFirst, we need to write out the full canonical SOP expression by expanding the minterm list. A minterm is a product term that includes every variable in the function, either in its complemented or uncomplemented form. The variables are ordered with $A$ as the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and $C$ as the Least Significant Bit (LSB).\n\nThe minterms are identified by their decimal equivalents:\n- Minterm $m_0$ corresponds to the binary value $000$, which is the product term $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C}$.\n- Minterm $m_1$ corresponds to the binary value $001$, which is the product term $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}C$.\n- Minterm $m_2$ corresponds to the binary value $010$, which is the product term $\\overline{A}B\\overline{C}$.\n- Minterm $m_3$ corresponds to the binary value $011$, which is the product term $\\overline{A}BC$.\n\nThe full canonical SOP expression is the sum of these minterms:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}C + \\overline{A}B\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}BC$$\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression using the rules of Boolean algebra. We look for adjacent terms that differ by only one variable.\n\nLet's group the terms strategically:\n$$F(A,B,C) = (\\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}C) + (\\overline{A}B\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}BC)$$\n\nFor the first pair of terms, $(\\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}C)$, we can factor out the common part $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}$:\n$$\\overline{A}\\overline{B}(\\overline{C} + C)$$\nUsing the Boolean identity $X + \\overline{X} = 1$, we have $\\overline{C} + C = 1$. So, the expression simplifies to $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}(1) = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}$.\n\nFor the second pair of terms, $(\\overline{A}B\\overline{C} + \\overline{A}BC)$, we can factor out the common part $\\overline{A}B$:\n$$\\overline{A}B(\\overline{C} + C)$$\nAgain, using the identity $\\overline{C} + C = 1$, this simplifies to $\\overline{A}B(1) = \\overline{A}B$.\n\nNow, substitute these simplified parts back into the main expression for $F$:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}\\overline{B} + \\overline{A}B$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression further. The common term is $\\overline{A}$:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}(\\overline{B} + B)$$\n\nApplying the identity $X + \\overline{X} = 1$ one more time, we get $\\overline{B} + B = 1$:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}(1)$$\n\nThis yields the final minimal standard SOP expression:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A}$$\n\nAlternatively, one could use a Karnaugh map (K-map) for simplification. For a 3-variable function, we set up a $2 \\times 4$ grid. We place '1's in the cells corresponding to the minterms $0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\nThe K-map is as follows (with $A$ for rows and $BC$ for columns):\n```\n       BC\n      00  01  11  10\n    +---+---+---+---+\nA=0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |  (cells for m0, m1, m3, m2)\n    +---+---+---+---+\nA=1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  (cells for m4, m5, m7, m6)\n    +---+---+---+---+\n```\nWe can form the largest possible group of adjacent '1's. In this case, there is a group of four '1's that covers the entire top row. To find the term for this group, we identify the variable(s) that remain constant within the group.\n- For this group, the variable $A$ is always $0$.\n- The variable $B$ takes on values $0$ and $1$.\n- The variable $C$ takes on values $0$ and $1$.\n\nSince $B$ and $C$ change within the group, they are eliminated. The only variable that remains constant is $A=0$. Therefore, the simplified term for this group is $\\overline{A}$. As this group covers all the '1's in the map, the minimal expression is simply $F = \\overline{A}$. Both methods yield the same result.",

This practice challenges you to translate a real-world hardware requirement—detecting misaligned memory accesses in a processor—into a precise Boolean function. You will derive a minimal SOP expression that implements the specified alignment rules, bridging the gap between a high-level specification and its hardware implementation .",

            "problem": "Consider a load/store unit in a $32$-bit processor that enforces alignment constraints at the level of the two least significant address bits. Let $L \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be the control signal that is asserted for a memory load, and $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be the control signal that is asserted for a memory store. Let $A_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $A_0 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be the two least significant bits of the byte address. The unit must raise a misaligned-access detect signal $M \\in \\{0,1\\}$ whenever a requested access violates alignment, with the following precise semantics:\n- For a load ($L = 1$), alignment requires $A_1 A_0 = 00$ in binary. Equivalently, the load is misaligned if and only if $(A_1, A_0) \\neq (0,0)$.\n- For a store ($S = 1$), alignment permits $A_1 A_0 \\in \\{00,10\\}$ in binary. Equivalently, the store is misaligned if and only if $(A_1, A_0) \\notin \\{(0,0),(1,0)\\}$.\n\nAssume the control signals satisfy $L,S \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and that in correctly orchestrated memory access cycles they will not be asserted simultaneously. However, your logic must be functionally correct for all Boolean inputs. Use the standard Boolean algebra over $\\{0,1\\}$ with sum-of-products form defined as a logical disjunction ($+$) of product terms (logical conjunctions) of literals (variables or their complements). Starting from the fundamental definitions of Boolean operations, minterms, and set inclusion, derive a minimal sum-of-products expression for $M$ in terms of $L$, $S$, $A_1$, and $A_0$ that exactly detects misalignment as specified.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single closed-form Boolean expression using $+$ for logical disjunction and juxtaposition for logical conjunction. Do not introduce any additional variables. No numerical rounding is required. The final answer must be a single analytical expression.",
            "solution": "The misalignment signal $M$ is asserted if a load is active ($L=1$) and its address is misaligned, or if a store is active ($S=1$) and its address is misaligned.\n\nFirst, we define the misalignment conditions as Boolean expressions:\n- **Load Misalignment**: A load is misaligned if $(A_1, A_0) \\neq (0,0)$. This is the logical OR of the bits being non-zero, so the condition is $A_1 + A_0$.\n- **Store Misalignment**: A store is misaligned if $(A_1, A_0) \\notin \\{(0,0), (1,0)\\}$. This occurs when $A_0=1$, so the condition is simply $A_0$.\n\nCombining these with their respective control signals gives the total expression for $M$:\n$$M(L, S, A_1, A_0) = L(A_1 + A_0) + S A_0$$\n\nTo get the sum-of-products (SOP) form, we apply the distributive law to the first term:\n$$M = L A_1 + L A_0 + S A_0$$\n\nTo confirm this expression is minimal, we can analyze the prime implicants. The function corresponds to the minterms $\\sum m(5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15)$. A Karnaugh map reveals three prime implicants: $L A_1$, $L A_0$, and $S A_0$.\n- The term $L A_1$ is essential because it is the only prime implicant that covers minterm $m_{10}$ ($L=1, S=0, A_1=1, A_0=0$).\n- The term $S A_0$ is essential because it is the only prime implicant that covers minterm $m_5$ ($L=0, S=1, A_1=0, A_0=1$).\n- The term $L A_0$ is essential because it is the only prime implicant that covers minterm $m_9$ ($L=1, S=0, A_1=0, A_0=1$).\n\nSince all three product terms in the expression are essential prime implicants, their sum constitutes the unique minimal SOP form.",

            "problem": "A hypothetical load-store architecture uses a fixed-width opcode field of $6$ bits, denoted by Boolean variables $o_5, o_4, o_3, o_2, o_1, o_0$. A control output $IsALU\\_Imm$ must be asserted if and only if the opcode belongs to the class of arithmetic and logic instructions with immediate operands. The architecture assigns encodings to instruction classes as follows (the $*$ symbols denote do-not-care bits for this classification):\n\n- ALU with immediate operand (ALU-Imm): all opcodes with the $4$-bit prefix $o_5 o_4 o_3 o_2 = 1 0 1 0$, i.e., the set $\\{1010**\\}$ where each $*$ can be either $0$ or $1$.\n- Shift with immediate operand (SHIFT-Imm): all opcodes with the $4$-bit prefix $o_5 o_4 o_3 o_2 = 1 0 1 1$, i.e., the set $\\{1011**\\}$.\n- ALU with register operand (ALU-Reg): all opcodes with the $4$-bit prefix $o_5 o_4 o_3 o_2 = 1 0 0 0$, i.e., the set $\\{1000**\\}$.\n\nYou are to derive the sum-of-products (SOP) form of $IsALU\\_Imm$ starting from the definition of a sum of minterms that enumerate all members of the ALU-Imm class.

You will use a Programmable Logic Array (PLA) with the standard structure: both the true and complemented forms of each input are available to the AND-plane, product terms are formed in the AND-plane by connecting literals, and outputs are formed in the OR-plane by summing selected product terms. The cost of a PLA implementation is proportional to the total number of programmable connections, defined as the sum of:\n- the number of literal connections made into the AND-plane to form product terms, and\n- the number of product-to-output connections made in the OR-plane.\n\nTasks:\n1.

            "solution": "**Part 1: Derivation of the SOP expression for $IsALU\\_Imm$**\n\nThe control signal $IsALU\\_Imm$ must be asserted (equal to $1$) if and only if the $6$-bit opcode $(o_5, o_4, o_3, o_2, o_1, o_0)$ belongs to the ALU-Imm class.

This corresponds to the set of four specific opcodes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $101000$\n    \\item $101001$\n    \\item $101010$\n    \\item $101011$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe Boolean expression for $IsALU\\_Imm$ can be written as the canonical sum-of-products, or disjunction of minterms, where each minterm corresponds to one of these four opcodes. A minterm is a product (AND) of all variables in the function, where a variable appears in its true form if its corresponding bit is $1$ and in its complemented form if its corresponding bit is $0$.\n\nThe four minterms are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item For opcode $101000$: $m_{40} = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1} \\overline{o_0}$\n    \\item For opcode $101001$: $m_{41} = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1} o_0$\n    \\item For opcode $101010$: $m_{42} = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1 \\overline{o_0}$\n    \\item For opcode $101011$: $m_{43} = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1 o_0$\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe initial SOP expression for $IsALU\\_Imm$ is the logical sum (OR) of these minterms:\n$$IsALU\\_Imm = (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1} \\overline{o_0}) + (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1} o_0) + (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1 \\overline{o_0}) + (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1 o_0)$$\nWe simplify this expression using the adjacency theorem, $XY + X\\overline{Y} = X$, to systematically eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, we combine $m_{40}$ and $m_{41}$, which differ only in $o_0$:\n$$(o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1} \\overline{o_0}) + (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1} o_0) = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1} (\\overline{o_0} + o_0) = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1}$$\nSimilarly, we combine $m_{42}$ and $m_{43}$, which also differ only in $o_0$:\n$$(o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1 \\overline{o_0}) + (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1 o_0) = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1 (\\overline{o_0} + o_0) = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1$$\nThe expression for $IsALU\\_Imm$ is now the sum of these two new product terms:\n$$IsALU\\_Imm = (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} \\overline{o_1}) + (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2} o_1)$$\nThese two terms differ only in $o_1$.

The minimal product term for this class is:\n$$P_{SHIFT\\_Imm} = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 o_2$$\nThe ALU-Reg class is defined by the prefix $o_5 o_4 o_3 o_2 = 1000$. The minimal product term for this class is:\n$$P_{ALU\\_Reg} = o_5 \\overline{o_4} \\overline{o_3} \\overline{o_2}$$\nAn SOP expression for $RegWrite$ is the disjunction of these three product terms:\n$$RegWrite = P_{ALU\\_Imm} + P_{SHIFT\\_Imm} + P_{ALU\\_Reg}$$\n$$RegWrite = (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2}) + (o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 o_2) + (o_5 \\overline{o_4} \\overline{o_3} \\overline{o_2})$$\nThis expression explicitly shows that the single product term implementing $IsALU\\_Imm$, which is $o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2}$, appears as the first disjunct in a valid SOP expression for $RegWrite$.\n\n**Part 3: Quantification of PLA Savings**\n\nThe cost of a PLA implementation is the sum of connections in the AND-plane (number of literals) and connections in the OR-plane (number of product terms summed for each output). We compare two scenarios.\n\nLet the three unique product terms be:\n$P_1 = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 \\overline{o_2}$ (for $IsALU\\_Imm$)\n$P_2 = o_5 \\overline{o_4} o_3 o_2$ (for SHIFT-Imm)\n$P_3 = o_5 \\overline{o_4} \\overline{o_3} \\overline{o_2}$ (for ALU-Reg)\n\nEach product term has $4$ literals.\n\n**Scenario A: Duplicating the product term (No Sharing)**\nIn this scenario, the term $P_1$ is generated twice in the AND-plane: once for $IsALU\\_Imm$ and a second time for $RegWrite$. Let's call the duplicate $P'_1$.\n-   **AND-plane implementation:** Realize four product terms: $P_1$ (for $IsALU\\_Imm$), and $P'_1, P_2, P_3$ (for $RegWrite$).\n-   **AND-plane cost:** Total literal connections = $4 (\\text{for } P_1) + 4 (\\text{for } P'_1) + 4 (\\text{for } P_2) + 4 (\\text{for } P_3) = 16$.\n-   **OR-plane implementation:**\n    -   $IsALU\\_Imm = P_1$. This requires $1$ connection.\n    -   $RegWrite = P'_1 + P_2 + P_3$. This requires $3$ connections.\n-   **OR-plane cost:** Total OR-plane connections = $1 + 3 = 4$.\n-   **Total Cost (Scenario A):** $16 (\\text{AND}) + 4 (\\text{OR}) = 20$ connections.\n\n**Scenario B: Sharing the product term**\nIn this scenario, the term $P_1$ is generated once in the AND-plane and its output is fanned out to both OR gates for $IsALU\\_Imm$ and $RegWrite$.\n-   **AND-plane implementation:** Realize three unique product terms: $P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n-   **AND-plane cost:** Total literal connections = $4 (\\text{for } P_1) + 4 (\\text{for } P_2) + 4 (\\text{for } P_3) = 12$.\n-   **OR-plane implementation:**\n    -   $IsALU\\_Imm = P_1$. This requires $1$ connection.\n    -   $RegWrite = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$. This requires $3$ connections.\n-   **OR-plane cost:** Total OR-plane connections = $1 + 3 = 4$.\n-   **Total Cost (Scenario B):** $12 (\\text{AND}) + 4 (\\text{OR}) = 16$ connections.\n\n**Calculation of Savings**\nThe savings are the difference in total cost between the two scenarios.\n$$\\text{Savings} = \\text{Cost(Scenario A)} - \\text{Cost(Scenario B)}$$\n$$\\text{Savings} = 20 - 16 = 4$$\nThe saving of $4$ connections comes from the AND-plane by not realizing a duplicate product term.
