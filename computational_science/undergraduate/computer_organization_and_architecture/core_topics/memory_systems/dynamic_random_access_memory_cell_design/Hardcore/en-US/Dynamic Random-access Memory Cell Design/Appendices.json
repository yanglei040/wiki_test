This practice focuses on the critical relationship between the physical components of the cell—the access transistor's resistance and the storage capacitor's capacitance—and the timing parameters that govern reliable data storage.

            "problem": "A single cell in Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) is written by asserting its wordline and driving its bitline to a rail, then is read by precharging the bitline to $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$, reasserting the wordline, and allowing charge sharing to develop a small differential that is sensed by a latch. Consider a freshly written logical one in a DRAM cell that initially stored a logical zero. Assume the following physical model and parameters:\n\n- The storage capacitor has value $C_s$, and the column bitline has lumped capacitance $C_b$.\n- The access transistor when enabled has an effective on-resistance $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the wordline is sufficiently boosted so that the full rail voltage is delivered to the cell node in steady state (no threshold drop).\n- During the write of a logical one, the bitline is driven to $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ by a low-impedance driver; for the transient charging of the storage node, the effective series resistance is dominated by $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n- The write begins from an initial storage-node voltage of $0$ and proceeds for a duration $T_{\\mathrm{w}}$ with the wordline asserted and the bitline held at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$.\n- Immediately after the write ends, ideal equalization and precharge restore the bitline to exactly $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$ before the read begins; ignore any finite precharge time so that the only timing margin required arises from ensuring the written charge is sufficient. Neglect all leakage during the separation.\n- The sense amplifier requires that, at the beginning of the read (just after charge sharing between the cell and the precharged bitline but before any active amplification), the bitline deviation magnitude from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$ be at least $V_{s}$ to guarantee correct decision.\n\nStarting from first principles (capacitor charging through a resistor and charge sharing), derive an analytic expression for the minimum write duration $T_{\\min}$ that guarantees the subsequent immediate read of this cell produces at least the required initial bitline deviation $V_{s}$. Then evaluate $T_{\\min}$ numerically for\n$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1.2\\,\\text{V}$, $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 25\\,\\text{k}\\Omega$, $C_s = 30\\,\\text{fF}$, $C_b = 300\\,\\text{fF}$, and $V_{s} = 15\\,\\text{mV}$. Express the final time in nanoseconds and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum write duration, $T_{\\min}$, for a DRAM cell to ensure a subsequent read is successful. This requires a two-part analysis: first, modeling the write operation to find the cell voltage as a function of time, and second, modeling the read operation to relate the written cell voltage to the bitline voltage swing detected by the sense amplifier.\n\nFirst, we analyze the write process. A logical 'one' is written to a cell initially at $0\\,\\text{V}$. The bitline is driven to $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, and the access transistor, with on-resistance $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, connects the bitline to the storage capacitor $C_s$. This setup forms a simple first-order RC circuit. The voltage on the storage capacitor, $V_{\\mathrm{cell}}(t)$, as it charges towards the final voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ from an initial voltage of $0\\,\\text{V}$ is described by the equation:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{cell}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} + (0 - V_{\\mathrm{DD}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}}}\\right)$$\nwhere the charging time constant is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}} = R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s$. This simplifies to:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{cell}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s}\\right)\\right)$$\nAfter a write duration of $T_{\\mathrm{w}}$, the voltage stored in the cell, which we will denote as $V_{\\mathrm{written}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{written}} = V_{\\mathrm{cell}}(T_{\\mathrm{w}}) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{w}}}{R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nNext, we analyze the read process. The read operation begins with the bitline, with capacitance $C_b$, precharged to a voltage of $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$. The wordline is then asserted, connecting the storage capacitor $C_s$ (at voltage $V_{\\mathrm{written}}$) to the bitline capacitor $C_b$. Charge is conserved during the subsequent charge sharing process.\nThe total charge before connecting the capacitors is the sum of the charge on the cell and the charge on the bitline:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{total}} = Q_s + Q_b = C_s V_{\\mathrm{written}} + C_b\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}$$\nAfter connection, the two capacitors are in parallel, with a total capacitance of $C_s + C_b$, and they settle to a final equilibrium voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{final}}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{final}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{total}}}{C_s + C_b} = \\frac{C_s V_{\\mathrm{written}} + C_b\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}}{C_s + C_b}$$\n\nThe sense amplifier requires that the magnitude of the bitline voltage deviation from its precharge level, $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$, be at least $V_{s}$. The deviation, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BL}}$, is:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BL}} = V_{\\mathrm{final}} - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}$$\nSince we are reading a 'one', $V_{\\mathrm{written}} > V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$, so $V_{\\mathrm{final}} > V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/2$, and the deviation is positive. The condition is $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\ge V_{s}$.\n$$ \\frac{C_s V_{\\mathrm{written}} + C_b\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}}{C_s + C_b} - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2} \\ge V_{s} $$\nTo simplify the left-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{C_s V_{\\mathrm{written}} + C_b\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2} - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}(C_s + C_b)}{C_s + C_b} \\ge V_{s} $$\n$$ \\frac{C_s V_{\\mathrm{written}} - C_s\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}}{C_s + C_b} \\ge V_{s} $$\n$$ \\frac{C_s}{C_s + C_b} \\left(V_{\\mathrm{written}} - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2}\\right) \\ge V_{s} $$\nThis inequality sets a minimum required voltage for $V_{\\mathrm{written}}$ to satisfy the sensing margin. Let's solve for this minimum voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{written,min}}$:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{written,min}} - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2} = V_{s} \\frac{C_s + C_b}{C_s} $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{written,min}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2} + V_{s} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_b}{C_s}\\right) $$\n\nTo find the minimum write time, $T_{\\min}$, we set the cell voltage after writing, $V_{\\mathrm{cell}}(T_{\\min})$, equal to this minimum required voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{written,min}}$:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\min}}{R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}{2} + V_{s} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_b}{C_s}\\right) $$\nNow, we solve for $T_{\\min}$. First, isolate the exponential term:\n$$ 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\min}}{R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{V_{s}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_b}{C_s}\\right) $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\min}}{R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{V_{s}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_b}{C_s}\\right) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{T_{\\min}}{R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s} = \\ln\\left[\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{V_{s}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_b}{C_s}\\right)\\right] $$\nFinally, the analytic expression for $T_{\\min}$ is:\n$$ T_{\\min} = -R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s \\ln\\left[\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{V_{s}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} \\left(1 + \\frac{C_b}{C_s}\\right)\\right] $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given parameters:\n$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1.2\\,\\text{V}$\n$R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 25\\,\\text{k}\\Omega = 25 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\Omega$\n$C_s = 30\\,\\text{fF} = 30 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$\n$C_b = 300\\,\\text{fF} = 300 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}$\n$V_{s} = 15\\,\\text{mV} = 15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$\n\nFirst, calculate the write time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{w}} = R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_s = (25 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\Omega) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}) = 750 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s} = 0.75\\,\\text{ns} $$\nNext, calculate the term inside the logarithm:\n$$ \\frac{V_{s}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} = \\frac{15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}}{1.2\\,\\text{V}} = 0.0125 $$\n$$ 1 + \\frac{C_b}{C_s} = 1 + \\frac{300 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}}{30 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}} = 1 + 10 = 11 $$\nThe argument of the logarithm is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - (0.0125)(11) = 0.5 - 0.1375 = 0.3625 $$\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression for $T_{\\min}$:\n$$ T_{\\min} = -(0.75 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}) \\ln(0.3625) $$\nUsing a calculator, $\\ln(0.3625) \\approx -1.014805$.\n$$ T_{\\min} \\approx -(0.75 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}) \\times (-1.014805) \\approx 0.761104 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe problem asks for the result in nanoseconds, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ T_{\\min} \\approx 0.761\\,\\text{ns} $$\nThe final numerical answer is $0.761$.",

The process is governed by the principle of conservation of charge.\n\nLet the initial voltage on the cell be $V_\\text{cell}$ and the initial voltage on the bitline be $V_\\text{BL,init}$.

By convention, a stored '1' corresponds to the cell being charged to $V_\\text{DD}$, and a stored '0' corresponds to $0\\,\\text{V}$.\n-   For a stored '1': $V_\\text{cell} = V_\\text{cell,1} = V_\\text{DD} = 0.50\\,\\text{V}$.\n-   For a stored '0': $V_\\text{cell} = V_\\text{cell,0} = 0\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the perturbation is the same in both cases:\n$$|\\Delta V_\\text{BL}| = \\left| \\frac{C_s(V_\\text{DD} - V_\\text{pre})}{C_s + C_b} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{C_s(0 - V_\\text{pre})}{C_s + C_b} \\right| = \\frac{C_s}{C_s + C_b} \\left| \\frac{V_\\text{DD}}{2} \\right|$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$|\\Delta V_\\text{BL}| = \\frac{30\\,\\text{fF}}{30\\,\\text{fF} + 300\\,\\text{fF}} \\times \\left( \\frac{0.50\\,\\text{V}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{30}{330} \\times (0.25\\,\\text{V}) = \\frac{1}{11} \\times 0.25\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$|\\Delta V_\\text{BL}| = \\frac{0.25}{11}\\,\\text{V} \\approx 0.022727\\,\\text{V} = 22.73\\,\\text{mV}$$\n\n### Part 2: Minimum Required Gain ($A$)\n\nThe problem specifies a criterion for successful sensing. The amplified initial differential must exceed a trip voltage $V_\\text{trip}$ that accounts for sensor imperfections.\nThe trip voltage is defined as:\n$$V_\\text{trip} = V_\\text{off,max} + 4\\,V_{n,\\text{rms}}$$\nUsing the given values for maximum offset and noise:\n$$V_\\text{trip} = 10\\,\\text{mV} + 4 \\times (7.5\\,\\text{mV}) = 10\\,\\text{mV} + 30\\,\\text{mV} = 40\\,\\text{mV}$$\nThe condition for the minimum gain $A_\\text{min}$ is:\n$$A_\\text{min} \\cdot |\\Delta V_\\text{BL}| \\ge V_\\text{trip}$$\nSolving for $A_\\text{min}$:\n$$A_\\text{min} = \\frac{V_\\text{trip}}{|\\Delta V_\\text{BL}|}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$A_\\text{min} = \\frac{40\\,\\text{mV}}{ \\frac{0.25}{11}\\,\\text{V}} = \\frac{40\\,\\text{mV}}{ \\frac{250}{11}\\,\\text{mV}} = \\frac{40 \\times 11}{250} = \\frac{440}{250} = \\frac{44}{25} = 1.76$$\nThus, the minimum required gain is $A_\\text{min} = 1.76$, which is approximately $1.8$.\n\n### Part 3: Dominant Failure Modes as $V_\\text{DD} \\to V_\\text{th}$\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of failure modes when the supply voltage $V_\\text{DD}$ becomes very close to the access transistor's threshold voltage $V_\\text{th}$. We are given $V_\\text{DD} = 0.50\\,\\text{V}$ and $V_\\text{th} = 0.40\\,\\text{V}$, which already represents a low-overdrive scenario. As $V_\\text{DD}$ is reduced further towards $V_\\text{th}$:\n\n1.  **Reduced Sense Margin**: The sense margin is the magnitude of the readable signal, $|\\Delta V_\\text{BL}|$. As shown in Part 1, $|\\Delta V_\\text{BL}|$ is directly proportional to $V_\\text{DD}$. As $V_\\text{DD}$ decreases, the signal available for the sense amplifier shrinks, making it more susceptible to noise and offset, thus increasing the bit error rate. This is a fundamental limitation.\n\n2.  **Write-ability Failure**: To write a logic '1' into the cell, the bitline is driven to $V_\\text{DD}$ and the wordline is activated (e.g., to $V_\\text{DD}$). The NMOS access transistor acts as a pass gate. The voltage on the storage capacitor cannot exceed $V_\\text{G} - V_\\text{th}$, where $V_\\text{G}$ is the gate voltage (wordline voltage). Assuming $V_\\text{G} = V_\\text{DD}$, the maximum voltage that can be stored is $V_\\text{cell,1,max} = V_\\text{DD} - V_\\text{th}$. As $V_\\text{DD} \\to V_\\text{th}$, $V_\\text{cell,1,max} \\to 0$. This means it becomes impossible to store a voltage level for '1' that is distinct from the '0' level. This is a catastrophic write failure. A DRAM read is destructive, requiring the data to be written back (restored). This write-ability failure thus also means a failure to restore the cell's state after reading.\n\n3.  **Insufficient Charge Transfer**: The speed of the read and write operations depends on the current supplied by the access transistor. This current is a strong function of the gate overdrive voltage, $V_\\text{GS} - V_\\text{th}$. Assuming the wordline is driven to $V_\\text{DD}$, the overdrive is $V_\\text{DD} - V_\\text{th}$. As $V_\\text{DD} \\to V_\\text{th}$, the overdrive approaches zero, and the transistor enters deep subthreshold operation. Its effective on-resistance ($R_\\text{on}$) increases exponentially. The time constant for charge sharing, $\\tau \\approx R_\\text{on} (C_s || C_b)$, becomes extremely large. If $\\tau$ exceeds the time allocated for access in the memory's timing specifications, charge transfer will be incomplete. This leads to a smaller-than-expected $\\Delta V_\\text{BL}$ during a read and an incompletely written voltage level during a write/restore, further degrading both sense margin and write-ability.\n\nCombining these points, the dominant failures as $V_\\text{DD} \\to V_\\text{th}$ are the collapse of the sense margin and the failure of write/restore operations due to both voltage level limitations and insufficient charge transfer speed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. Dominant failures are reduced sense margin and read disturb; minimum $A \\approx 1.8$.**\n    The gain calculation is correct. \"Reduced sense margin\" is a correct failure mode. However, \"read disturb\" (affecting neighboring cells) is a secondary concern compared to the fundamental failure to read or write the currently selected cell under the condition $V_\\text{DD} \\to V_\\text{th}$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect** (incomplete description of failures).\n\n-   **B. Dominant failures are increased dielectric leakage and soft errors; minimum $A \\approx 9.0$.**\n    The gain calculation is incorrect. \"Increased dielectric leakage\" is incorrect; lower voltages reduce electric fields and thus typically reduce field-driven leakage. While susceptibility to soft errors increases, it's not as direct and catastrophic a failure mode as the others in this specific scenario.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Dominant failures are capacitive crosstalk and wordline half-select upset; minimum $A \\approx 0.9$.**\n    The gain calculation is incorrect. The failure modes listed are general DRAM issues but are not the primary, dominant failures stemming directly from $V_\\text{DD} \\to V_\\text{th}$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Dominant failures are reduced sense margin and write-ability (insufficient cell restore/charge transfer within timing); minimum $A \\approx 1.8$.**\n    The calculated minimum gain $A \\approx 1.8$ matches our derivation ($1.76$). The listed failure modes—\"reduced sense margin\" and \"write-ability (insufficient cell restore/charge transfer within timing)\"—are a precise and accurate summary of the consequences of operating with $V_\\text{DD}$ close to $V_\\text{th}$, as analyzed above. This option correctly identifies both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the problem.\n    **Verdict: Correct**.",

In a typical folded-bitline architecture, both bitlines are precharged to a mid-supply voltage $V_{P} = V_{DD}/2$, and a cross-coupled sense amplifier resolves the small differential that develops when the cell is connected. Consider a proposed dual-capacitor cell in which two equal capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ of value $C$ are connected to the two complementary bitlines, respectively, through two identical access transistors driven by the same wordline. The cell stores a logical $\\mathbf{1}$ by setting the internal storage node connected to $C_1$ at $V_{DD}$ and the node connected to $C_2$ at $0$, and a logical $\\mathbf{0}$ by inverting those levels. Assume each bitline exhibits capacitance $C_b$, both bitlines are precharged to $V_{P} = V_{DD}/2$, and the wordline turns on both access transistors simultaneously during a read.

Because sensing is differential, common-mode disturbances that add a voltage $\\delta V$ equally to both bitlines immediately before wordline activation leave the initial differential unchanged to first order, improving robustness to supply droop and coupling that is symmetric on the pair.\n\nC.

Both bitlines are precharged to $V_{P} = V_{DD}/2$. Let $C_b$ denote the total capacitance of each bitline to ground, and assume the access transistors are sufficiently conductive that we can treat the connection as instantaneous for the purpose of initial voltage after charge sharing. The cross-coupled sense amplifier initially senses the differential between the two bitlines; its resolution speed and reliability are governed by that initial differential magnitude.\n\nSingle-capacitor (one-transistor–one-capacitor) baseline:\n- Suppose a stored logical $\\mathbf{1}$ corresponds to the storage-node voltage $V_{cell} = V_{DD}$, and logical $\\mathbf{0}$ corresponds to $V_{cell} = 0$.\n- Upon wordline activation, the cell capacitor $C$ connects to one bitline, which was at $V_{P}$, while the complementary bitline initially remains at $V_{P}$ (until the sense amplifier reacts).\n- Charge conservation on the connected bitline node gives the immediate post-connection bitline voltage\n$$\nV_{\\text{BL, single}} = \\frac{C_b V_{P} + C V_{cell}}{C_b + C}.\n$$\n- The initial differential at the sense amplifier inputs is\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{single}} = V_{\\text{BL, single}} - V_{P} = \\frac{C}{C_b + C} \\bigl( V_{cell} - V_{P} \\bigr).\n$$\n- With $V_{P} = V_{DD}/2$, the magnitude for either data value is\n$$\n\\lvert \\Delta V_{\\text{single}} \\rvert = \\frac{C}{C_b + C}\\, \\frac{V_{DD}}{2}.\n$$\n\nDual-capacitor proposal:\n- For logical $\\mathbf{1}$, set $V_{cell,1} = V_{DD}$ on the node connected to $C_1$ and $V_{cell,2} = 0$ on the node connected to $C_2$; for logical $\\mathbf{0}$, invert these levels. Assume $C_1 = C_2 = C$.\n- Upon wordline activation, both storage capacitors connect simultaneously to their respective bitlines, each initially at $V_{P}$.\n- Charge conservation for each bitline yields\n$$\nV_{\\text{BL}} = \\frac{C_b V_{P} + C V_{cell,1}}{C_b + C}, \\quad\nV_{\\text{BLB}} = \\frac{C_b V_{P} + C V_{cell,2}}{C_b + C}.\n$$\n- For logical $\\mathbf{1}$, where $V_{cell,1} = V_{DD}$ and $V_{cell,2} = 0$, the initial differential becomes\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{dual}} = V_{\\text{BL}} - V_{\\text{BLB}} = \\frac{C}{C_b + C}\\, \\bigl( V_{DD} - 0 \\bigr) = \\frac{C}{C_b + C}\\, V_{DD}.\n$$\n- Comparing magnitudes,\n$$\n\\frac{ \\lvert \\Delta V_{\\text{dual}} \\rvert }{ \\lvert \\Delta V_{\\text{single}} \\rvert } = \\frac{ \\frac{C}{C_b+C} V_{DD} }{ \\frac{C}{C_b+C} \\frac{V_{DD}}{2} } = 2,\n$$\nso the dual-capacitor cell produces twice the initial differential signal.\n\nCommon-mode disturbance analysis:\n- Consider an additive disturbance $\\delta V$ that appears equally on both bitlines immediately before connection, shifting both from $V_{P}$ to $V_{P} + \\delta V$.\n- Using charge conservation, both $V_{\\text{BL}}$ and $V_{\\text{BLB}}$ shift by amounts that include terms proportional to $C_b (V_{P} + \\delta V)$ in the numerator. The $\\delta V$ terms contribute equally to both bitlines and cancel in the difference $V_{\\text{BL}} - V_{\\text{BLB}}$ to first order. Hence the differential signal is largely insensitive to common-mode disturbances at the instant of sensing, which improves robustness.\n\nWordline loading:\n- The wordline drives the gates of the access transistors. In the single-capacitor case, each cell contributes one access-transistor gate capacitance to the wordline load. In the dual-capacitor cell, each cell contributes two access-transistor gate capacitances driven by the same wordline. Therefore, the per-row wordline capacitive load approximately doubles, and the energy to activate the wordline scales accordingly with $E_{\\text{WL}} \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2} C_{\\text{WL}} V_{\\text{WL}}^2$; with $C_{\\text{WL}}$ doubled per row, the activation energy increases relative to the single-capacitor baseline.\n\nWrite/refresh energy:\n- The energy stored on a capacitor at voltage $V$ is $E = \\tfrac{1}{2} C V^2$. A full write or refresh that places one storage node at $V_{DD}$ and the complementary node at $0$ entails charging one capacitor to $V_{DD}$ (storing $\\tfrac{1}{2} C V_{DD}^2$) and discharging the other to $0$ (removing its stored energy if it was previously charged). In dynamic operation, the supply energy drawn per full toggle is approximately proportional to the number of capacitors being driven and the square of the voltage swing; driving two capacitors of value $C$ to complementary levels approximately doubles the energy relative to a single-capacitor cell under the same toggling activity. Thus, write and refresh energy per full toggle is roughly doubled.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: The derivations above yield $\\Delta V_{\\text{dual}} = \\dfrac{C}{C_b + C}\\, V_{DD}$ and $\\Delta V_{\\text{single}} = \\dfrac{C}{C_b + C}\\, \\dfrac{V_{DD}}{2}$, demonstrating a factor of $2$ increase. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option B: The differential readout cancels equal perturbations on both inputs to first order; common-mode disturbances such as supply droop appearing identically on both bitlines do not change the initial differential. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option C: The dual-capacitor cell adds a second access transistor per cell driven by the wordline, increasing gate capacitance load per row and the energy to raise the wordline. Claiming no increase is inconsistent with fundamental capacitive loading. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option D: Energy considerations using $E = \\tfrac{1}{2} C V^2$ imply toggling two storage capacitors to complementary rails approximately doubles the dynamic energy relative to a single-capacitor cell under comparable activity. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option E: During read, each storage capacitor connects to its own bitline; they do not appear in parallel on a single bitline. There is no doubling of effective capacitance on one bitline nor a quadrupling of differential signal beyond the factor in Option A. Verdict: Incorrect.",
