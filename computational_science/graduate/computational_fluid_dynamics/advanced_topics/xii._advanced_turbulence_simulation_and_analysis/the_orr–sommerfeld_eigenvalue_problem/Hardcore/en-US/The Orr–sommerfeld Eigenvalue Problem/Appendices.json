It contains no contradictions, missing information, or other flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is a standard conceptual question in fluid mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided form for a single spatio-temporal mode of the perturbation:\n$$\nq'(x,y,t)=\\Re\\left\\{\\hat{q}(y)\\,\\exp\\left[i\\,\\alpha\\,(x-c\\,t)\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\nThe complex eigenvalue $c$ is written in terms of its real and imaginary parts as $c = c_r + i\\,c_i$, where $c_r = \\operatorname{Re}(c)$ and $c_i = \\operatorname{Im}(c)$. We substitute this into the exponential term's argument:\n$$\ni\\,\\alpha\\,(x-c\\,t) = i\\,\\alpha\\,[x-(c_r+i\\,c_i)t] = i\\,\\alpha\\,(x-c_r t) - i^2\\alpha c_i t = i\\,\\alpha\\,(x-c_r t) + \\alpha c_i t\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for the perturbation:\n$$\nq'(x,y,t) = \\Re\\left\\{\\hat{q}(y)\\,\\exp\\left[\\alpha c_i t + i\\,\\alpha\\,(x-c_r t)\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\exp(A+B) = \\exp(A)\\exp(B)$, we can separate the real and imaginary parts of the exponent:\n$$\nq'(x,y,t) = \\Re\\left\\{\\hat{q}(y)\\,e^{\\alpha c_i t}\\,\\exp\\left[i\\,\\alpha\\,(x-c_r t)\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\nLet the complex eigenfunction be $\\hat{q}(y) = |\\hat{q}(y)|e^{i\\phi_q(y)}$. The full expression becomes:\n$$\nq'(x,y,t) = \\Re\\left\\{|\\hat{q}(y)|e^{i\\phi_q(y)}\\,e^{\\alpha c_i t}\\,e^{i\\alpha(x-c_r t)}\\right\\} = e^{\\alpha c_i t}\\,\\Re\\left\\{|\\hat{q}(y)|\\,e^{i[\\alpha(x-c_r t) + \\phi_q(y)]}\\right\\}\n$$\n$$\nq'(x,y,t) = |\\hat{q}(y)|e^{\\alpha c_i t}\\,\\cos\\left(\\alpha(x-c_r t) + \\phi_q(y)\\right)\n$$\n\n**Interpretation of Temporal Growth/Decay:**\nThe amplitude of the perturbation at a fixed position $(x, y)$ is given by the factor multiplying the oscillatory cosine term: $A(t) = |\\hat{q}(y)|e^{\\alpha c_i t}$. The temporal evolution of this amplitude is determined by the factor $e^{\\alpha c_i t}$.\nThe temporal growth rate, typically denoted $\\sigma$, is the coefficient of $t$ in the exponent of the amplitude term. Thus, the growth rate is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\alpha c_i = \\alpha \\operatorname{Im}(c)\n$$\nSince the problem states $\\alpha  0$, the sign of the growth rate $\\sigma$ is determined by the sign of $c_i = \\operatorname{Im}(c)$.\n- If $c_i  0$, then $\\sigma  0$, and the perturbation grows exponentially in time. The flow is unstable.\n- If $c_i  0$, then $\\sigma  0$, and the perturbation decays exponentially in time. The flow is stable.\n- If $c_i = 0$, then $\\sigma = 0$, and the perturbation amplitude is constant in time. The flow is neutrally stable.\n\n**Interpretation of Phase Speed:**\nThe phase of the wave is the argument of the cosine function: $\\Theta(x,t) = \\alpha(x-c_r t) + \\phi_q(y)$.\nA surface of constant phase is defined by $\\Theta(x,t) = \\text{constant}$. To find the speed at which these surfaces propagate in the $x$-direction (for a fixed $y$), we differentiate this condition with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[\\alpha(x-c_r t) + \\phi_q(y)\\right] = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\text{constant})\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt} - c_r\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\alpha  0$, we must have $\\frac{dx}{dt} - c_r = 0$. The term $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ represents the velocity of a point of constant phase along the $x$-axis. This is, by definition, the phase speed, $c_p$.\n$$\nc_p = \\frac{dx}{dt} = c_r = \\operatorname{Re}(c)\n$$\nSo, the real part of the eigenvalue $c$ is the streamwise phase speed of the wave. The phase lines, defined by $x - c_r t = \\text{const}$, translate in the positive $x$-direction at speed $c_r$ if $c_r  0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the convention above, writing $c=c_r+i\\,c_i$ with $c_r=\\operatorname{Re}(c)$ and $c_i=\\operatorname{Im}(c)$, the temporal growth rate at fixed $x$ is $\\sigma=\\alpha\\,\\operatorname{Im}(c)$, so $\\operatorname{Im}(c)0$ implies exponential amplification $\\sim e^{\\alpha\\,\\operatorname{Im}(c)\\,t}$, and the streamwise phase speed is $\\operatorname{Re}(c)$, so phase lines $x-c_r t=\\text{const}$ translate downstream at speed $c_r$.**\n-   The growth rate is correctly identified as $\\sigma = \\alpha c_i = \\alpha\\operatorname{Im}(c)$.\n-   The implication that $\\operatorname{Im}(c)0$ leads to exponential amplification $\\sim e^{\\alpha c_i t}$ is correct.\n-   The phase speed is correctly identified as $c_r = \\operatorname{Re}(c)$.\n-   The description of phase lines and their propagation speed is correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under the same convention, the temporal growth rate at fixed $x$ is $\\sigma=\\operatorname{Im}(c)$ and the streamwise phase speed is $\\alpha\\,\\operatorname{Re}(c)$.**\n-   The temporal growth rate is $\\sigma = \\alpha \\operatorname{Im}(c)$, not $\\sigma = \\operatorname{Im}(c)$. This statement omits the crucial factor of the wavenumber $\\alpha$. The correct relationship is between the imaginary part of the complex frequency $\\omega = \\omega_r + i\\omega_i$ and the growth rate, where $\\omega_i = \\sigma$. Since $c = \\omega/\\alpha$, we have $\\omega_i = \\operatorname{Im}(\\alpha c) = \\alpha \\operatorname{Im}(c)$.\n-   The phase speed is $\\operatorname{Re}(c)$, not $\\alpha\\operatorname{Re}(c)$. The quantity $\\alpha\\operatorname{Re}(c)$ is the real part of the complex frequency, $\\omega_r$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under the same convention, a positive $\\operatorname{Im}(c)$ corresponds to temporal decay, and the streamwise phase speed is $-\\operatorname{Re}(c)$ because the base flow convects waves downstream.**\n-   As derived, a positive $\\operatorname{Im}(c)$ leads to a positive growth rate $\\sigma = \\alpha \\operatorname{Im}(c)$ (since $\\alpha0$), which corresponds to temporal *growth* (amplification), not decay.\n-   The phase speed is $+\\operatorname{Re}(c)$, not $-\\operatorname{Re}(c)$. The form $x-c_r t$ in the phase function corresponds to propagation at speed $+c_r$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Interpreting $c=\\omega/\\alpha$ with $\\omega=\\omega_r+i\\,\\omega_i$, the envelope (group) velocity equals $\\operatorname{Re}(c)$ for all $\\alpha$, so both phase and envelope propagate at the same speed $\\operatorname{Re}(c)$ in a general shear flow.**\n-   The group velocity is defined as $v_g = \\frac{d\\omega_r}{d\\alpha}$.\n-   The phase speed is $c_p = \\omega_r/\\alpha$. From the problem statement and our derivation, $c_p = c_r = \\operatorname{Re}(c)$.\n-   Thus, $\\omega_r = \\alpha c_r$. In a general shear flow, the eigenvalue $c$ depends on the wavenumber $\\alpha$ (and other parameters like the Reynolds number), so $c_r = c_r(\\alpha)$. The flow is dispersive.\n-   We calculate the group velocity using the product rule: $v_g = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha}(\\alpha c_r(\\alpha)) = 1 \\cdot c_r(\\alpha) + \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{dc_r}{d\\alpha}$.\n-   The statement claims that $v_g = \\operatorname{Re}(c) = c_r$. This would imply $c_r(\\alpha) + \\alpha \\frac{dc_r}{d\\alpha} = c_r(\\alpha)$, which requires $\\alpha \\frac{dc_r}{d\\alpha} = 0$. Since $\\alpha0$, this means $\\frac{dc_r}{d\\alpha}=0$.\n-   This condition, $c_r$ being independent of $\\alpha$, is the definition of a non-dispersive medium. However, waves governed by the Orr–Sommerfeld equation are generally dispersive (i.e., $\\frac{dc_r}{d\\alpha} \\neq 0$). Therefore, the group velocity is generally not equal to the phase velocity. The statement is false for a general shear flow.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Because the Blasius profile lacks an inflection point (i.e., $U''(y)$ does not change sign), Rayleigh’s inviscid criterion predicts stability; therefore TS amplification is inherently viscous and is enabled by the phase shift that arises in the viscous critical layer, which depends parametrically on $U'(y_c)$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in classical hydrodynamic stability theory. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and uses precise, objective language. The setup describes a canonical problem: the stability of a Blasius boundary layer to small-amplitude disturbances, governed by the Orr–Sommerfeld equation. I will now proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe stability of the parallel shear flow $\\mathbf{U}=(U(y), 0)$ to small two-dimensional disturbances is governed by the Orr-Sommerfeld (OS) equation. For a normal-mode disturbance with streamfunction $\\psi(x, y, t) = \\phi(y) \\exp\\{i(\\alpha x - \\omega t)\\}$, the OS equation is:\n$$\ni\\alpha \\mathrm{Re} \\left[ (U - c)(\\phi'' - \\alpha^2 \\phi) - U'' \\phi \\right] = (\\phi'''' - 2\\alpha^2\\phi'' + \\alpha^4 \\phi)\n$$\nHere, primes denote differentiation with respect to $y$, $c=\\omega/\\alpha$ is the complex phase speed, and $\\mathrm{Re}$ is the Reynolds number. A disturbance amplifies if the imaginary part of the frequency, $\\omega_i$, is positive. Since $\\omega = \\alpha c$, this corresponds to $c_i = \\mathrm{Im}(c)  0$. The OS equation is an eigenvalue problem for $c$ for given $\\alpha$ and $\\mathrm{Re}$. The terms $U(y)$ and its curvature $U''(y)$ explicitly appear in the operator. The mean shear $U'(y)$ influences the solution through its relation to $U(y)$ and $U''(y)$.\n\nThe evolution of the disturbance kinetic energy is described by the Reynolds-Orr equation. The rate of change of disturbance kinetic energy, integrated over the domain, is given by the balance between production, $P$, and dissipation, $D$:\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{dt} = P - D\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the total kinetic energy of the disturbance. The production term, which represents the transfer of energy from the mean flow to the disturbances, is given by:\n$$\nP = - \\int_0^\\infty \\overline{u'v'} \\frac{dU}{dy} dy\n$$\nwhere $\\overline{u'v'}$ is the Reynolds stress, and hats on disturbance quantities are omitted for clarity. For a normal mode $\\phi(y) e^{i(\\alpha x - \\omega t)}$, the time-averaged Reynolds stress is $\\overline{u'v'} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Re}\\{u' (v')^*\\}$, where $u'=\\phi'$ and $v'=-i\\alpha\\phi$.\n\nThe Blasius profile is a solution to the boundary layer equations for flow over a flat plate. A key feature is that it has no inflection point for $y0$; its curvature $U''(y)$ is strictly negative for $y \\in (0, \\infty)$ and only zero at $y=0$ and as $y \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In the Reynolds–Orr disturbance energy budget obtained from the linearized equations, the only explicit mean-flow term contributing directly to production is the mean shear $U'(y)$ via the integrand $-u'v' U'(y)$, whereas $U''(y)$ influences amplification only indirectly by shaping the eigenfunction through the Orr–Sommerfeld operator. There is no explicit $U''(y)$ term in the energy production integrand.**\n\nThe integral for the energy production rate is $P = - \\int \\overline{u'v'} U'(y) dy$. The integrand contains the mean shear $U'(y)$ explicitly. The mean flow curvature, $U''(y)$, does not appear in this expression. However, the OS equation, $[(U - c)(\\phi'' - \\alpha^2 \\phi) - U''\\phi] = (i\\alpha\\mathrm{Re})^{-1}(\\phi'''' - ...)$, explicitly contains the $U''(y)$ term. The solution to the OS equation gives the eigenfunction $\\phi(y)$, which determines the disturbance velocities $u' = \\phi'$ and $v' = -i\\alpha\\phi$. These velocities, in turn, determine the Reynolds stress $\\overline{u'v'}$. Therefore, $U''(y)$ influences the energy production $P$ indirectly by shaping the eigenfunction $\\phi(y)$, but it does not appear as an explicit term in the production integrand itself. This statement is a correct description of the roles of $U'(y)$ and $U''(y)$ in the energy budget.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In the inviscid limit for parallel flow, TS amplification persists in the Blasius boundary layer despite the absence of an inflection point because negative curvature $U''(y)  0$ near the wall is sufficient for inviscid instability.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Rayleigh's inflection point criterion states that a *necessary* condition for the instability of an inviscid parallel shear flow is that the mean velocity profile $U(y)$ must have an inflection point ($U''(y)=0$) somewhere in the domain. The Blasius profile does not have an inflection point for $y0$. Therefore, according to inviscid theory, the Blasius boundary layer is stable. The claim that negative curvature $U''(y)0$ is *sufficient* for inviscid instability is false. Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) amplification in a Blasius boundary layer is a purely viscous phenomenon that vanishes in the inviscid limit ($\\mathrm{Re} \\to \\infty$).\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In the viscous critical layer about $y = y_c$ defined by $U(y_c) = c_r$, an inner scaling analysis of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation yields a layer thickness $\\delta_c$ that obeys the balance $\\delta_c \\sim [\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\,U'(y_c)]^{-1/3}$; thus, increasing $U'(y_c)$ shrinks the critical-layer thickness and intensifies the viscous phase lag that enables energy extraction.**\n\nNear the critical layer $y_c$, we can approximate $U(y) - c_r \\approx U'(y_c)(y-y_c)$. The Orr-Sommerfeld equation involves a balance between the inertial term $(U-c_r)\\phi''$ and the viscous term $(i\\alpha\\mathrm{Re})^{-1}\\phi''''$. Let $\\tilde{y} = (y-y_c)/\\delta_c$ be the scaled inner variable. Then $d/dy = (1/\\delta_c) d/d\\tilde{y}$. The balance becomes:\n$$\nU'(y_c) \\delta_c \\tilde{y} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\delta_c^2} \\phi_{\\tilde{y}\\tilde{y}} \\sim \\frac{1}{i\\alpha\\mathrm{Re}} \\frac{1}{\\delta_c^4} \\phi_{\\tilde{y}\\tilde{y}\\tilde{y}\\tilde{y}}\n$$\nFor these terms to be of the same order, we must have:\n$$\n\\frac{U'(y_c)}{\\delta_c} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\alpha\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\delta_c^4} \\implies \\delta_c^3 \\sim \\frac{1}{\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\,U'(y_c)}\n$$\nThis yields the scaling $\\delta_c \\sim [\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\,U'(y_c)]^{-1/3}$. This is the correct scaling for the viscous critical layer. Consequently, if the mean shear at the critical layer, $U'(y_c)$, increases, the denominator increases, and thus the critical layer thickness $\\delta_c$ decreases. A thinner layer implies stronger viscous effects are necessary to resolve the disturbance structure, which leads to a more pronounced phase shift between velocity components, a key mechanism for energy extraction from the mean flow. The statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. For the Blasius profile, $U''(y) \\equiv 0$ for all $y$, so curvature plays no role in the Orr–Sommerfeld operator; only mean shear $U'(y)$ matters for TS amplification.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The Blasius profile is the solution to $f'''(\\eta) + \\frac{1}{2}f(\\eta)f''(\\eta) = 0$, where $U/U_\\infty = f'(\\eta)$. The curvature is proportional to $f'''(\\eta)$, so $U''(y) \\propto f'''(\\eta) = -\\frac{1}{2}f(\\eta)f''(\\eta)$. Since $f(\\eta)0$ and $f''(\\eta)0$ for $\\eta0$, the curvature $U''(y)$ is strictly negative for $y0$. It is not identically zero. Because $U''(y)$ is non-zero, it is a key term in the Orr-Sommerfeld operator, $[(U-c)(\\phi''-\\alpha^2\\phi) - U''\\phi] = \\dots$. The premise of the statement is false, and therefore so is the conclusion.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Because the Blasius profile lacks an inflection point (i.e., $U''(y)$ does not change sign), Rayleigh’s inviscid criterion predicts stability; therefore TS amplification is inherently viscous and is enabled by the phase shift that arises in the viscous critical layer, which depends parametrically on $U'(y_c)$.**\n\nThis statement provides an accurate summary of the mechanism for TS instability.\n1.  *Rayleigh's criterion and inviscid stability*: As established in the analysis of option B, the absence of an inflection point in the Blasius profile implies it is stable in the inviscid limit. This part is correct.\n2.  *Inherently viscous nature*: Since the flow is stable in the inviscid limit but unstable at finite Reynolds numbers, the instability mechanism must be viscous. This is correct.\n3.  *Phase shift in the viscous critical layer*: The instability arises from viscous effects, which are particularly important in the critical layer around $y_c$. Viscosity introduces a phase difference between the streamwise ($u'$) and wall-normal ($v'$) disturbance velocity components. This phase shift allows the Reynolds stress $\\overline{u'v'}$ to be non-zero and create a positive production term $P = -\\int\\overline{u'v'}U'dy  0$, feeding energy from the mean flow into the disturbance. This is the correct physical mechanism.\n4.  *Parametric dependence on $U'(y_c)$*: As shown in the analysis for option C, the structure and dynamics of the critical layer, and thus the phase shift it generates, are governed by parameters that include the local mean shear $U'(y_c)$. This is also correct.\nThe entire statement is a correct and coherent description of TS wave amplification in a Blasius boundary layer.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**",

The goal is to reveal non-normal amplifications via large resolvent norms even when the spectrum indicates stability.\n\nYour task is to write a complete, runnable program that:\n- Constructs Chebyshev collocation differentiation matrices on $[-1,1]$ to approximate spatial derivatives $D$ and $D^2$.\n- Discretizes the Orr–Sommerfeld operators $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ for plane Poiseuille flow with $U(y)=1-y^2$ and $U''(y)=-2$, using the standard normal-velocity formulation that yields\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}=(D^2-\\alpha^2 I)^2 - i\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\left(\\operatorname{diag}(U)\\,(D^2-\\alpha^2 I) - \\operatorname{diag}(U'')\\right),\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}=-i\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\,(D^2-\\alpha^2 I),\n$$\nwith boundary rows replaced to enforce $v(\\pm 1)=0$ and $v'(\\pm 1)=0$ via a tau method by setting appropriate rows in $\\mathcal{L}$ to identity and derivative rows, and setting corresponding rows in $\\mathcal{M}$ to zero.\n- Computes the resolvent norm $\\|(\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M})^{-1}\\|_2$ at a set of complex $z$ values on a rectangular grid in the complex plane, by using the relation $\\|(\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M})^{-1}\\|_2=1/\\sigma_{\\min}(\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M})$, where $\\sigma_{\\min}(\\cdot)$ is the smallest singular value (from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)).\n- For each specified test case, returns the maximum resolvent norm over the grid, demonstrating peaks in the pseudospectrum indicative of non-normal amplification.\n\nUse the following test suite comprising three cases, each described by $(\\mathrm{Re},\\alpha,N,\\text{grid})$, where $N$ is the number of Chebyshev intervals (so $N+1$ collocation points), and the grid is given by real-part bounds $[\\Re z_{\\min},\\Re z_{\\max}]$, imaginary-part bounds $[\\Im z_{\\min},\\Im z_{\\max}]$, and the number of samples in each direction:\n1. Case A (happy path, stable but non-normal): $\\mathrm{Re}=1000$, $\\alpha=1.0$, $N=64$, real-part grid $[0.2,1.0]$, imaginary-part grid $[-0.3,0.0]$, with $8\\times 8$ sampling.\n2. Case B (near classical instability threshold, larger amplification): $\\mathrm{Re}=6000$, $\\alpha=1.02$, $N=64$, real-part grid $[0.2,1.0]$, imaginary-part grid $[-0.3,0.1]$, with $8\\times 8$ sampling.\n3. Case C (edge case with lower wavenumber and fewer points): $\\mathrm{Re}=1000$, $\\alpha=0.5$, $N=48$, real-part grid $[0.2,1.0]$, imaginary-part grid $[-0.3,0.0]$, with $8\\times 8$ sampling.\n\nAll quantities are dimensionless; no physical units are required. Angles do not appear. The numerical outputs must be real-valued floats.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3]\"), where each \"result\" is the maximum resolvent norm over the grid for the corresponding test case. Round each result to six decimal places to ensure concise reporting.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the maximum resolvent norm for the discretized Orr–Sommerfeld operator for plane Poiseuille flow. This value is a key indicator of the potential for non-normal transient growth of disturbances in the flow, a phenomenon central to understanding subcritical transition to turbulence. The pseudospectrum, defined via the resolvent norm, provides a more complete picture of an operator's behavior than its spectrum (eigenvalues) alone, especially for non-normal operators common in fluid dynamics.\n\nThe solution is implemented by following a structured, principle-based approach.\n\n**1. Mathematical Formulation**\n\nThe starting point is the Orr–Sommerfeld equation, a fourth-order ordinary differential equation governing the stability of a parallel shear flow $U(y)$. For a normal mode disturbance with velocity profile $v(y)$, streamwise wavenumber $\\alpha$, and complex phase speed $c = \\omega/\\alpha$, the equation is:\n$$\n\\left( (D^2-\\alpha^2)^2 - i\\alpha\\mathrm{Re}\\left[ (U-c)(D^2-\\alpha^2) - U'' \\right] \\right) v(y) = 0\n$$\nwhere $D = d/dy$ and $\\mathrm{Re}$ is the Reynolds number. The flow is confined to a channel $y \\in [-1, 1]$ with no-slip, no-penetration boundary conditions $v(\\pm 1) = 0$ and $v'(\\pm 1) = 0$. The base flow is the plane Poiseuille profile $U(y) = 1-y^2$, for which $U''(y)=-2$.\n\nRearranging this equation into a generalized eigenvalue problem for the eigenvalue $z=c$ yields $\\mathcal{L}v = z\\mathcal{M}v$, where the operators $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ are given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = (D^2-\\alpha^2 I)^2 - i\\alpha \\mathrm{Re} \\left( \\operatorname{diag}(U) (D^2-\\alpha^2 I) - \\operatorname{diag}(U'') \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{M} = -i\\alpha \\mathrm{Re} (D^2-\\alpha^2 I)\n$$\nNote that the sign convention here might differ from some texts, as $\\mathcal{M}$ contains the term multiplying the eigenvalue $c$. Here we have taken the terms with $c$ to the right side of the equation. Also note that the problem statement has a subtle sign error in its definition of $\\mathcal{M}$; the eigenvalue problem is $(\\mathcal{L}_{OS} - c \\mathcal{M}_{OS})v = 0$. When we write it as $\\mathcal{L}v = c \\mathcal{M}v$, we get $\\mathcal{M} = \\alpha \\mathrm{Re}(D^2 - \\alpha^2 I)$ and $\\mathcal{L}$ contains the rest. However, this is equivalent to solving for $-c$ if we use the provided $\\mathcal{M}$. To conform strictly to the problem statement's given expressions for $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$, we will use them as provided, recognizing this is equivalent to a sign change in the resulting eigenvalue, which is immaterial for computing the resolvent norm of $\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M}$. The problem defines $z$ as the variable to scan over, not the eigenvalue itself.\n\nThe task is to compute the $\\epsilon$-pseudospectrum, which is the set of complex numbers $z$ for which the resolvent norm $\\|(\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M})^{-1}\\|_2$ is large. Specifically, we seek the maximum value of this norm over a specified grid in the complex plane. This maximum is related to the smallest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\min}$, of the matrix pencil $\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M}$ by the identity:\n$$\n\\|(\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M})^{-1}\\|_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\min}(\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M})}\n$$\n\n**2. Numerical Discretization: Chebyshev Collocation Method**\n\nTo solve this problem numerically, the continuous operators $D$ and $D^2$ must be replaced by finite-dimensional matrix approximations. The Chebyshev collocation method is selected for its high (spectral) accuracy for smooth functions.\n\nFirst, the domain $y \\in [-1, 1]$ is discretized using $N+1$ Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto points, given by $y_j = \\cos(j\\pi/N)$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N$. The function $v(y)$ is then represented by its values at these points, $v_j = v(y_j)$.\n\nThe first and second derivative operators, $D$ and $D^2$, are approximated by $(N+1) \\times (N+1)$ differentiation matrices, which we denote as $D^{(1)}$ and $D^{(2)}$. The second-derivative matrix can be efficiently computed as the square of the first, i.e., $D^{(2)} = (D^{(1)})^2$. The entries of $D^{(1)}$ are constructed using standard formulas for Chebyshev differentiation.\n\nWith these differentiation matrices, the continuous operators $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ are discretized into matrices, which we will also denote by $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ for simplicity. Let $I$ be the identity matrix, $D_2$ the matrix for $D^2$, and $D_4 = D_2^2$ the matrix for $D^4$. The discretized operators before applying boundary conditions are:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = (D_2 - \\alpha^2 I)^2 - i\\alpha \\mathrm{Re} \\left( \\mathrm{diag}(U(y_j)) (D_2 - \\alpha^2 I) - \\mathrm{diag}(U''(y_j)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{M} = -i\\alpha \\mathrm{Re} (D_2 - \\alpha^2 I)\n$$\nwhere $y_j$ are the collocation points.\n\n**3. Boundary Condition Enforcement: Tau Method**\n\nThe four boundary conditions $v(\\pm 1)=0$ and $v'(\\pm 1)=0$ must be incorporated into the matrix system. The problem specifies a tau method. A common implementation of this method for an $(N+1) \\times (N+1)$ system is to replace four rows of the discretized operator equation with equations representing the boundary conditions. The collocation points $y_0 = 1$ and $y_N = -1$ are the boundary points. The conditions are:\n1.  $v(1)=0 \\implies v_0 = 0$\n2.  $v(-1)=0 \\implies v_N = 0$\n3.  $v'(1)=0 \\implies (D^{(1)} v)_0 = \\sum_{j=0}^N D^{(1)}_{0j} v_j = 0$\n4.  $v'(-1)=0 \\implies (D^{(1)} v)_N = \\sum_{j=0}^N D^{(1)}_{Nj} v_j = 0$\n\nThese four linear algebraic equations replace rows of the system $(\\mathcal{L}-z\\mathcal{M})v=0$. We modify four rows of $\\mathcal{L}$ to represent these conditions and set the corresponding rows of $\\mathcal{M}$ to zero, as this forces the right-hand side of the boundary condition equations to be zero, independent of $z$. We will replace rows $0, 1, N-1, N$ of the system.\n-   Row $0$ of $\\mathcal{L}$ is set to $[1, 0, \\dots, 0]$ for $v_0=0$.\n-   Row $N$ of $\\mathcal{L}$ is set to $[0, \\dots, 0, 1]$ for $v_N=0$.\n-   Row $1$ of $\\mathcal{L}$ is set to the first row of $D^{(1)}$ for $v'(1)=0$.\n-   Row $N-1$ of $\\mathcal{L}$ is set to the last row of $D^{(1)}$ for $v'(-1)=0$.\n-   Rows $0, 1, N-1, N$ of $\\mathcal{M}$ are set to zero.\n\n**4. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  Receive parameters: Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}$, wavenumber $\\alpha$, polynomial degree $N$, and grid specifications.\n2.  Construct the $(N+1) \\times (N+1)$ Chebyshev first-derivative matrix $D^{(1)}$ and the collocation points $y$.\n3.  Compute $D_2 = (D^{(1)})^2$.\n4.  Assemble the full (pre-boundary condition) complex matrices $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ using the formulas from Step 2.\n5.  Modify $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ to enforce the boundary conditions as described in Step 3.\n6.  Generate a rectangular grid of complex points $z$ in the specified region $[\\Re z_{\\min}, \\Re z_{\\max}] \\times [\\Im z_{\\min}, \\Im z_{\\max}]$.\n7.  Initialize a variable `max_norm = 0`.\n8.  Iterate through each point $z$ on the grid:\n    a. Form the matrix pencil $P(z) = \\mathcal{L} - z\\mathcal{M}$.\n    b. Compute the singular values of $P(z)$ using a standard numerical library function (e.g., SVD).\n    c. Find the minimum singular value, $\\sigma_{\\min}$.\n    d. Calculate the resolvent norm as $1/\\sigma_{\\min}$.\n    e. Update `max_norm = max(max_norm, 1/sigma_{\\min})$.\n9.  Return the final `max_norm` for the test case.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for all test cases, and the final results are collected and formatted as required. The calculation of the singular values is the most computationally intensive step, and its repetition over the grid of $z$ values maps out the pseudospectrum, revealing the regions of high resolvent norm.",
