A homogeneous Dirichlet condition ($\\hat{q}(0) = 0$) at the inflow is standard for preventing artificial perturbations from entering the domain.

The corresponding eigenvalue problem becomes\n$$\n\\big(\\mathbf{A} - \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\,\\mathbf{M}\\big)\\,\\mathbf{q} \\;=\\; \\lambda\\,\\mathbf{M}\\,\\mathbf{q}.\n$$\nAssume the base flow is constant in the far field and the sponge layer smoothly attains a constant asymptotic value $\\sigma_\\infty  0$ in that far field. Using first principles—namely the linearized dynamical system structure, the energy inner product associated with $\\mathbf{M}$, and Fourier analysis of the far-field symbol—determine which of the following statements about the spectral effect of the sponge layer are correct.\n\nA. Appending the sponge layer corresponds to replacing $\\mathbf{A}$ by $\\mathbf{A} - \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\,\\mathbf{M}$, with $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\ge 0$ and self-adjoint relative to the $\\mathbf{M}$ inner product, which introduces nonnegative energy dissipation. This moves the continuous spectrum associated with far-field advection and radiation to the left in the complex plane by approximately $-\\sigma_\\infty$, while discrete physical eigenvalues that are spatially localized in the core region are only weakly perturbed, with leading-order shifts that scale with the fraction of their $\\mathbf{M}$-energy residing inside $\\Omega_s$.\n\nB. The primary effect of the sponge layer is equivalent to modifying the mass matrix as $\\mathbf{M} \\mapsto \\mathbf{M} + \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$, which increases the effective inertia and therefore tends to move the discrete physical eigenvalues to the right in the complex plane (larger real parts), potentially destabilizing previously stable modes.\n\nC. In the special case $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) \\equiv \\alpha  0$ uniform throughout the domain, the sponge operator is $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\,\\mathbf{M} = \\alpha\\,\\mathbf{M}$ and every eigenvalue undergoes an exact rigid translation: if $\\lambda_{\\text{old}}$ solves $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{q} = \\lambda_{\\text{old}} \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q}$, then $\\lambda_{\\text{new}} = \\lambda_{\\text{old}} - \\alpha$ solves $(\\mathbf{A} - \\alpha \\mathbf{M})\\mathbf{q} = \\lambda_{\\text{new}} \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q}$. For a far-field region with $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) \\to \\sigma_\\infty$, the essential spectrum associated with far-field advection–diffusion is translated left by approximately $-\\sigma_\\infty$, while discrete physical eigenvalues supported in the core shift by an amount $-\\big(\\mathbf{q}^\\ast \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q}\\big)/\\big(\\mathbf{q}^\\ast \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q}\\big)$ at leading order, which is small if $\\mathbf{q}$ has negligible energy in $\\Omega_s$.\n\nD. Because the sponge layer introduces pointwise damping, it renders the operator compact and completely removes the continuous spectrum, leaving only isolated, discrete eigenvalues; thus, the global spectrum becomes purely discrete.\n\nE. The sponge damping predominantly modifies the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues (oscillation frequencies) without significantly affecting the real parts (growth rates), since its action is equivalent to a phase shift in the far field.\n\nChoose all correct options.",
            "solution": "Options A and C are both correct as they accurately describe the effects of a sponge layer on the spectrum of an open-flow system.\n\nThe purpose of a sponge layer is to damp outgoing waves and prevent them from reflecting off the artificial computational boundary. This is achieved by adding a damping term $-\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{q}$ to the governing equations, which modifies the system operator from $\\mathbf{A}$ to $\\mathbf{A} - \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{M}$.\n\n-   **Option A** correctly summarizes the overall effect. The damping term introduces energy dissipation, which is its intended purpose. In the far-field where $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) \\to \\sigma_\\infty$, the sponge effectively shifts the continuous spectrum (associated with far-field radiating modes) to the left in the complex plane by an amount $-\\sigma_\\infty$. This stabilizes the non-physical modes associated with the truncated domain. Crucially, the discrete global modes, which are physically relevant and localized in the core of the domain where $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})=0$, are only very slightly perturbed because their spatial structure has minimal overlap with the sponge region.\n\n-   **Option C** provides a more detailed and also correct analysis. It starts with the exact result for a uniform damping coefficient $\\alpha$, which rigidly shifts all eigenvalues by $-\\alpha$. It then correctly applies this insight to the general case: the essential (continuous) spectrum is shifted by approximately $-\\sigma_\\infty$, and the shift for discrete eigenvalues is small, proportional to the mode's energy within the sponge region. The provided formula for the leading-order shift is a standard estimate (the Rayleigh quotient of the perturbation).\n\n-   Options B, D, and E are incorrect. The sponge is a dissipative element, so it stabilizes the system by moving eigenvalues to the left (decreasing their real part), not destabilizing it (B). It shifts the continuous spectrum, it does not remove it (D). It primarily affects the real part of the eigenvalues (growth rate), not the imaginary part (frequency) (E).",
