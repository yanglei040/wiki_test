            "problem": "Consider the Volume of Fluid (VOF) interface capturing strategy with the Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC) reconstruction in a uniform Cartesian cell. In the PLIC approach, the interface inside a given cell is reconstructed as a plane described by $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}=d$, where $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit normal vector estimated from the volume fraction field and $d$ is a plane constant chosen to match the known cell volume fraction. This contrasts with interface tracking methods (e.g., front-tracking) that explicitly advect a discretized interface.\n\nLet the cell be the unit cube $\\Omega=[0,1]^{3}$ in Cartesian coordinates and let the estimated unit normal be $\\mathbf{n}=(n_{x},n_{y},n_{z})$ with strictly positive components. The volume fraction $C\\in[0,1]$ denotes the fraction of $\\Omega$ occupied by the fluid on the side $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\leq d$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the plane constant $d$ for a PLIC interface reconstruction within a unit cubic cell, under the specific regime where the fluid-filled region forms a tetrahedron at the origin.\n\nThe problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Cell geometry: Unit cube $\\Omega = [0,1]^3$.\n- Interface plane equation: $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} = d$, where $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is a unit normal vector with $n_x>0$, $n_y>0$, $n_z>0$.\n- Fluid region: $\\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\Omega : \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} \\leq d\\}$.\n- Volume fraction: $C \\in [0,1]$.\n- Geometric regime: The fluid region is a tetrahedron with one vertex at the origin. This holds for $0 \\leq d \\leq \\min\\{n_x, n_y, n_z\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is rooted in standard methods of computational fluid dynamics, specifically the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method with PLIC reconstruction. The geometric and mathematical setup is rigorous and based on fundamental principles of analytic geometry.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary information to establish a unique relationship between the volume fraction $C$ and the plane constant $d$. The goal is to invert this relationship, which is possible as the volume is a monotonic function of $d$.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and devoid of any subjectivity.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The givens are sufficient and consistent. The condition $0 \\leq d \\leq \\min\\{n_x, n_y, n_z\\}$ correctly ensures that the plane's intercepts with the axes lie within the unit cube's boundaries emanating from the origin, thus forming a simple tetrahedron.\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the geometric definition of the fluid volume.\n\n1.  **Identify the Geometry and Vertices**:\n    The fluid region is defined by the inequalities $x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0, z \\ge 0$, and $n_x x + n_y y + n_z z \\le d$. This region is a tetrahedron. One vertex of this tetrahedron is the origin, $O=(0,0,0)$. The other three vertices are the points where the plane $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} = d$ intersects the coordinate axes.\n    -   Intersection with the x-axis ($y=0, z=0$):\n        $n_x x = d \\implies x_0 = \\frac{d}{n_x}$. The vertex is $P_x = (\\frac{d}{n_x}, 0, 0)$.\n    -   Intersection with the y-axis ($x=0, z=0$):\n        $n_y y = d \\implies y_0 = \\frac{d}{n_y}$. The vertex is $P_y = (0, \\frac{d}{n_y}, 0)$.\n    -   Intersection with the z-axis ($x=0, y=0$):\n        $n_z z = d \\implies z_0 = \\frac{d}{n_z}$. The vertex is $P_z = (0, 0, \\frac{d}{n_z})$.\n    The problem condition $0 \\leq d \\leq \\min\\{n_x, n_y, n_z\\}$ ensures that these intercepts $x_0, y_0, z_0$ are all less than or equal to $1$, so the tetrahedron lies entirely within the unit cube $\\Omega$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Volume**:\n    The volume $V$ of a tetrahedron with one vertex at the origin and the other three vertices on the coordinate axes at distances $x_0$, $y_0$, and $z_0$ from the origin is given by the formula:\n    $$ V = \\frac{1}{6} x_0 y_0 z_0 $$\n    Substituting the expressions for the intercepts found in the previous step:\n    $$ V = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{d}{n_x}\\right) \\left(\\frac{d}{n_y}\\right) \\left(\\frac{d}{n_z}\\right) $$\n    $$ V = \\frac{d^3}{6 n_x n_y n_z} $$\n\n3.  **Relate Volume to Volume Fraction**:\n    The volume fraction $C$ is the ratio of the fluid volume $V$ to the total volume of the computational cell $V_{\\text{cell}}$. The cell is a unit cube, so its volume is $V_{\\text{cell}} = 1^3 = 1$.\n    Therefore, the volume fraction is numerically equal to the fluid volume:\n    $$ C = \\frac{V}{V_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{V}{1} = V $$\n    Equating the expressions for $C$ and $V$:\n    $$ C = \\frac{d^3}{6 n_x n_y n_z} $$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Plane Constant $d$**:\n    The final step is to solve this equation for $d$. We rearrange the equation to isolate $d^3$:\n    $$ d^3 = 6 C n_x n_y n_z $$\n    Taking the cube root of both sides yields the desired expression for $d$ in terms of $C$, $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$:\n    $$ d = (6 C n_x n_y n_z)^{\\frac{1}{3}} $$\n    This is the closed-form analytic expression for the plane constant $d$ in the specified tetrahedral regime.",

For such a system, the solution to a Riemann problem at an interface separates the left and right initial states by a star region of constant pressure and velocity. These states are connected by waves propagating away from the interface.\n\nIn the left medium ($x<0$), the initial state $(p_{L}, u_{L})$ is connected to the interfacial state $(p_{L}^{*}, u^{*})$ by a left-propagating acoustic wave (characteristic speed $-c_{L}$). The relationship between the change in pressure and velocity across this wave is given by:\n$$p_{L}^{*} - p_{L} = -\\rho_{L} c_{L} (u^{*} - u_{L})$$\nUsing the definition of acoustic impedance, $Z_{j} = \\rho_{j} c_{j}$, this becomes our first equation:\n$$p_{L}^{*} = p_{L} - Z_{L}(u^{*} - u_{L}) \\quad (1)$$\n\nSimilarly, in the right medium ($x>0$), the initial state $(p_{R}, u_{R})$ is connected to the interfacial state $(p_{R}^{*}, u^{*})$ by a right-propagating acoustic wave (characteristic speed $+c_{R}$).
