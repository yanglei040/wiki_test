            "problem": "Consider a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate at a streamwise station located a distance $x$ from the leading edge. The free-stream speed is $U_{\\infty}$ and the kinematic viscosity is $\\nu$. A wall-resolved Large Eddy Simulation (LES) will be performed using prismatic inflation layers adjacent to the wall, transitioning to a hexahedral core mesh away from the wall. The mesh must be specified in wall units based on the friction velocity $u_{\\tau} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\tau_{w}/\\rho}$, where $\\tau_{w}$ is the wall shear stress and $\\rho$ is the fluid density, with the usual definition of wall units $y^{+} \\equiv y u_{\\tau}/\\nu$, $\\Delta x^{+} \\equiv \\Delta x\\, u_{\\tau}/\\nu$, and $\\Delta z^{+} \\equiv \\Delta z\\, u_{\\tau}/\\nu$. \n\n1) Starting from the following well-tested facts about near-wall wall-bounded turbulence and subgrid-scale modeling:\n- The near-wall cycle exhibits dominant energy-containing streaks with spanwise spacing $\\lambda_{z,\\mathrm{peak}}^{+} \\approx 100$ and streamwise elongated structures with dominant wavelength $\\lambda_{x,\\mathrm{peak}}^{+} \\approx 1000$ at $y^{+} = \\mathcal{O}(10)$, as supported by pre-multiplied spectra of wall shear stress and streamwise velocity fluctuations.\n- The subgrid filter width in wall-resolved LES should remain smaller than the local shear length scale $L_{s} \\sim \\kappa y$ in the logarithmic region (with $\\kappa \\approx 0.41$) to avoid excessive subgrid-modeling of energy-containing eddies.\n- The viscous sublayer thickness is $y^{+} \\lesssim 5$ and the buffer layer extends to $y^{+} \\approx 30$.\nUsing only these facts and the definitions of wall units, derive target constraints on the wall-parallel grid spacings and first off-wall point such that the resolved grid captures the energy-containing near-wall structures with a reasonable number of points per dominant wavelength and ensures that the subgrid cutoff is not above the shear length near the wall. Show that these lead to ranges consistent with $\\Delta x^{+} \\approx 50$–$150$, $\\Delta z^{+} \\approx 15$–$40$, and a first off-wall point at $y^{+} \\approx 1$ for wall-resolved LES.\n\n2) For a specific flat-plate case with $U_{\\infty} = 30\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$, and $x = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{m}$, estimate the local wall friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ using the one-seventh power-law correlation for the local skin-friction coefficient $C_{f,x}$ at station $x$,\n$$\nC_{f,x} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\tau_{w}}{\\rho U_{\\infty}^{2}} \\approx 0.026\\, \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{-1/7}, \\quad \\mathrm{Re}_{x} \\equiv \\frac{U_{\\infty} x}{\\nu},\n$$\nand compute the first-layer height $\\Delta y_{1}$ required to achieve $y_{1}^{+} \\equiv \\Delta y_{1} u_{\\tau}/\\nu = 1$.

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires a derivation of common meshing guidelines for wall-resolved Large Eddy Simulation (LES) from fundamental principles of near-wall turbulence. The second part is a numerical application of related empirical formulas to determine the number of inflation layers required to span a turbulent boundary layer.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that combines theoretical understanding with practical application. All provided information, including physical constants, empirical correlations, and turbulence phenomenology, is standard and accepted in the field. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Meshing Constraints for Wall-Resolved LES**\n\nThe goal is to derive target constraints for the grid spacing ($\\Delta x^{+}$, $\\Delta z^{+}$) and the first off-wall grid point position ($y_1^{+}$) for a wall-resolved LES. The derivation will be based on the provided facts about near-wall turbulent structures and subgrid-scale modeling principles.\n\n1.  **First Off-Wall Point ($y_1^{+}$):** The problem states that the viscous sublayer, where viscosity dominates and velocity profiles are steep, occupies the region $y^{+} \\lesssim 5$. To accurately capture the physics within this layer, particularly the wall shear stress $\\tau_w$ which is fundamental to the entire scaling, the computational grid must resolve this region. This means that the first grid point off the wall, $y_1$, must be placed well within the viscous sublayer. A typical and often stringent requirement is to place the first cell center at $y_1^{+} = y_1 u_{\\tau}/\\nu \\approx 1$. This ensures that there is at least one computational point deep within the sublayer, satisfying the condition $y_1^{+} \\lesssim 5$. Hence, the guideline $y_1^{+} \\approx 1$ is a direct consequence of the need to resolve the near-wall viscous-dominated region.\n\n2.  **Spanwise Grid Spacing ($\\Delta z^{+}$):** The problem provides a key fact that near-wall turbulence is characterized by dominant energy-containing structures, often called low-speed streaks, which have a characteristic spanwise spacing of $\\lambda_{z,\\mathrm{peak}}^{+} \\approx 100$. For an LES to be \"wall-resolved,\" it must resolve these energy-containing eddies, rather than modeling them. To resolve a structure of a certain wavelength, the grid spacing must be a fraction of that wavelength. Let $N_z$ be the number of grid points used to resolve the spanwise wavelength $\\lambda_{z,\\mathrm{peak}}^{+}$. The grid spacing is then $\\Delta z^{+} = \\lambda_{z,\\mathrm{peak}}^{+} / N_z$. To adequately capture the shape and dynamics of these streaks, $N_z$ must be greater than the Nyquist criterion of $2$. A typical range for reasonable resolution is $N_z \\in [2.5, 7]$.\n    -   For a minimal resolution of $N_z=2.5$ points per streak, the spanwise spacing would be $\\Delta z^{+} = 100 / 2.5 = 40$.\n    -   For a finer resolution of $N_z \\approx 7$ points, the spacing would be $\\Delta z^{+} = 100 / 7 \\approx 14.3$.\n    These bounds lead directly to the commonly cited range $\\Delta z^{+} \\approx 15$–$40$.\n\n3.  **Streamwise Grid Spacing ($\\Delta x^{+}$):** A similar argument applies to the streamwise direction. The near-wall structures are noted to be highly elongated, with a dominant streamwise wavelength of $\\lambda_{x,\\mathrm{peak}}^{+} \\approx 1000$. Let $N_x$ be the number of grid points used to resolve this length. The required streamwise grid spacing is $\\Delta x^{+} = \\lambda_{x,\\mathrm{peak}}^{+} / N_x$. While these structures are long, resolving their temporal evolution and spatial coherence is important. A typical range for $N_x$ might be $N_x \\in [7, 20]$.\n    -   For $N_x = 7$ points, the streamwise spacing would be $\\Delta x^{+} = 1000 / 7 \\approx 143$.\n    -   For $N_x = 20$ points, the spacing would be $\\Delta x^{+} = 1000 / 20 = 50$.\n    This line of reasoning leads to the recommended range of $\\Delta x^{+} \\approx 50$–$150$.\n\n4.  **Consistency with the Shear Length Scale Criterion:** The problem states that the subgrid filter width, $\\Delta_{LES}$, should remain smaller than the local shear length scale, $L_s \\sim \\kappa y$, in the logarithmic region (where $y^{+} \\gtrsim 30$ and $\\kappa \\approx 0.41$). In wall units, this is $\\Delta_{LES}^{+}  \\kappa y^{+}$. The filter width $\\Delta_{LES}$ is typically a function of the local cell dimensions, e.g., $\\Delta_{LES} = (\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z)^{1/3}$. The derived resolutions for $\\Delta x^{+}$ and $\\Delta z^{+}$ are primarily driven by the need to resolve the large, energy-containing eddies in the buffer layer ($y^+ \\approx 5-30$), not necessarily by the shear-length-scale argument in the log layer. In practice, the resolution requirements for $\\Delta x^{+}$ and $\\Delta z^{+}$ can conflict with the $L_s$ criterion, especially at the lower edge of the log-layer where $L_s$ is small. For instance, at $y^+=30$, $L_s^+ \\approx 0.41 \\times 30 = 12.3$. A spanwise resolution of $\\Delta z^+ = 30$ would violate $\\Delta z^+  L_s^+$. This reflects a known compromise in wall-resolved LES, where resolving the dominant near-wall structures is prioritized, and some modeling of smaller-scale shear-generated eddies in the log-layer is accepted as a consequence of finite computational resources. The derived ranges are therefore understood to be *consistent* with the overall goals of wall-resolved LES, even if not every criterion is strictly satisfied at every point in the flow.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Inflation Layer Count**\n\nThis part requires a numerical calculation for a specific flow case. The given parameters are $U_{\\infty} = 30\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$, and $x = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{m}$. The inflation layer growth rate is $r = 1.20$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Reynolds number at station $x$:**\n    $$ \\mathrm{Re}_{x} = \\frac{U_{\\infty} x}{\\nu} = \\frac{(30\\ \\mathrm{m/s})(1.0\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}} = 2.0 \\times 10^6 $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the local skin-friction coefficient $C_{f,x}$:**\n    $$ C_{f,x} \\approx 0.026\\, \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{-1/7} = 0.026 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^6)^{-1/7} $$\n    $$ C_{f,x} \\approx 0.026 \\times (7.9455)^{-1} \\approx 0.003272 $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$:**\n    The definition of $C_{f,x}$ is $C_{f,x} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\tau_{w}}{\\rho U_{\\infty}^{2}}$. The friction velocity is $u_{\\tau} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\tau_{w}/\\rho}$.\n    $$ u_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{f,x} \\rho U_{\\infty}^{2}}{2\\rho}} = U_{\\infty} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{f,x}}{2}} $$\n    $$ u_{\\tau} \\approx 30\\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.003272}{2}} = 30 \\times \\sqrt{0.001636} \\approx 30 \\times 0.040448 \\approx 1.2134\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the first-layer height $\\Delta y_1$:**\n    The requirement is for the first cell center to be at $y_1^{+} = 1$. For a wall-adjacent cell, we approximate $y_1 \\approx \\Delta y_1 / 2$, but it is common practice in this context to set the first cell height $\\Delta y_1$ such that its center $y_1$ is at the target $y^+$ location, or simply, to satisfy $y_1^+ = \\Delta y_1 u_\\tau / \\nu = 1$. The problem statement uses the notation $y_{1}^{+} \\equiv \\Delta y_{1} u_{\\tau}/\\nu = 1$.\n    $$ \\Delta y_{1} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\nu}{u_{\\tau}} \\approx \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}}{1.2134\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 1.236 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the boundary-layer thickness $\\delta(x)$:**\n    $$ \\delta(x) \\approx 0.37\\, x\\, \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{-1/5} = 0.37 \\times (1.0\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^6)^{-1/5} $$\n    $$ (2.0 \\times 10^6)^{1/5} \\approx 18.2056 $$\n    $$ \\delta(x) \\approx 0.37 \\times (18.2056)^{-1} \\approx 0.020323\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\n6.  **Determine the minimal number of layers $N$:**\n    The cumulative thickness of $N$ prismatic layers with initial height $\\Delta y_1$ and growth factor $r$ is given by the sum of a geometric series:\n    $$ S_N = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\Delta y_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\Delta y_1 r^{k-1} = \\Delta y_1 \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} $$\n    We need to find the minimal integer $N$ such that $S_N \\ge \\delta(x)$.\n    $$ \\Delta y_1 \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} \\ge \\delta(x) $$\n    Substituting the known values ($r=1.20$):\n    $$ (1.236 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times \\frac{1.20^N - 1}{1.20 - 1} \\ge 0.020323\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n    $$ (1.236 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times \\frac{1.20^N - 1}{0.20} \\ge 0.020323 $$\n    $$ 6.18 \\times 10^{-5} \\times (1.20^N - 1) \\ge 0.020323 $$\n    $$ 1.20^N - 1 \\ge \\frac{0.020323}{6.18 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 328.85 $$\n    $$ 1.20^N \\ge 329.85 $$\n    To solve for $N$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$ N \\ln(1.20) \\ge \\ln(329.85) $$\n    $$ N \\ge \\frac{\\ln(329.85)}{\\ln(1.20)} \\approx \\frac{5.7986}{0.1823} \\approx 31.808 $$\n    Since $N$ must be an integer, the minimal number of layers required is the next integer greater than or equal to this value.\n    $$ N = 32 $$\n    Performing the calculation with higher precision confirms this result:\n    $u_{\\tau} \\approx 1.2134555\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\Delta y_1 \\approx 1.23611 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\delta(x) \\approx 0.0203232\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n    $N \\ge \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta(x)(r-1)}{\\Delta y_1}\\right)}{\\ln(r)} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{0.0203232 \\times 0.2}{1.23611 \\times 10^{-5}}\\right)}{\\ln(1.2)} = \\frac{\\ln(1+328.825)}{\\ln(1.2)} = \\frac{\\ln(329.825)}{\\ln(1.2)} \\approx 31.804$.\n    The minimal integer is $N=32$.",

Finally, we will derive the expressions for the absolute errors of the orthogonal approximation and the weighted deferred correction scheme.\n\nLet the set of orthonormal basis vectors in the plane defined by $\\boldsymbol{S}$ and $\\boldsymbol{d}$ be $\\{\\boldsymbol{e}_d, \\boldsymbol{e}_t\\}$.

Absolute error of the orthogonal approximation: $E_{orth} = |\\Gamma A g_t \\sin\\theta|$\n2.  Absolute error after weighted deferred non-orthogonal correction: $E_{corr} = |(1-\\omega)\\Gamma A g_t \\sin\\theta|$\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ given in degrees must be converted to radians for use in the trigonometric function $\\sin\\theta$.

            "problem": "A three-dimensional swept wing of semi-span $b$ is to be meshed with prismatic inflation layers adjacent to the wall and a hexahedral core in the outer volume. Let the prismatic stack have $N$ layers with geometric growth rate $g \\geq 1$ and first-layer thickness $y_1$. The $i$-th prismatic layer thickness is $y_i = y_1 g^{i-1}$ for $i = 1,2,\\dots,N$, and the last-layer thickness is $h_N = y_1 g^{N-1}$. The local turbulent boundary-layer thickness along the wing surface is $x \\mapsto \\delta(x)$, and for robust satisfaction of near-wall resolution it is required that the prismatic stack thickness satisfies $y_1 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g^{i-1} \\geq \\delta(x)$ for all $x$; to pose a tractable design, impose the worst-case constraint $y_1 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g^{i-1} \\geq \\delta_{\\max}$, where $\\delta_{\\max} = \\max_{x} \\delta(x)$. The wall-unit requirement mandates that the non-dimensional first-cell height lies in the interval $y^+ \\in [0.5, 2]$ along the entire wing. Using the standard definition $y^+ = u_{\\tau} y_1 / \\nu$, with friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, this implies $y_1 \\in [y_{\\min}, y_{\\max}]$, where $y_{\\min} = 0.5 \\nu / u_{\\tau}$ and $y_{\\max} = 2 \\nu / u_{\\tau}$.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed optimization problem grounded in the principles of computational fluid dynamics mesh generation. The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and free of contradictions. I will now proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem is to minimize a cost functional $J(y_1, g, N)$ subject to a set of constraints on the decision variables $(y_1, g, N)$, which represent the first-layer thickness, the geometric growth rate, and the number of layers in a prismatic near-wall mesh.\n\n### Part 1: Formulation of the Optimization Problem\n\nThe objective function to be minimized is given by:\n$$\nJ(y_1, g, N) = N + \\alpha \\frac{H}{h_N}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of the last-layer thickness, $h_N = y_1 g^{N-1}$, the objective function is:\n$$\nJ(y_1, g, N) = N + \\alpha H y_1^{-1} g^{1-N}\n$$\nThe decision variables are $(y_1, g, N)$. For the purpose of analysis using differential calculus, $N$ is treated as a continuous real variable. The parameters $\\alpha$ and $H$ are positive constants.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n\n1.  **Boundary-Layer Resolution:** The total thickness of the $N$ prismatic layers, $Y_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i$, must be at least $\\delta_{\\max}$. The sum is a geometric series:\n    $$\n    Y_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_1 g^{i-1} = y_1 \\frac{g^N - 1}{g - 1} \\quad (\\text{for } g \\neq 1)\n    $$\n    The constraint is $Y_N \\geq \\delta_{\\max}$. To write this in the standard form $c(x) \\leq 0$, we have:\n    $$\n    c_1: \\delta_{\\max} - y_1 \\frac{g^N - 1}{g - 1} \\leq 0\n    $$\n2.  **Wall-Unit Requirement:** The first-layer thickness $y_1$ is bounded by $y_{\\min}$ and $y_{\\max}$, where $y_{\\min} = 0.5 \\nu / u_{\\tau}$ and $y_{\\max} = 2 \\nu / u_{\\tau}$. This gives two constraints:\n    $$\n    c_2: y_{\\min} - y_1 \\leq 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    c_3: y_1 - y_{\\max} \\leq 0\n    $$\n3.  **Growth Rate Bounds:** The growth rate $g$ must be physically meaningful ($g \\geq 1$) and satisfy a quality criterion ($g \\leq g_{\\mathrm{qual}}$).\n    $$\n    c_4: 1 - g \\leq 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    c_5: g - g_{\\mathrm{qual}} \\leq 0\n    $$\n4.  **Number of Layers:** For a prismatic stack to exist, there must be at least one layer, so $N \\geq 1$.\n    $$\n    c_6: 1 - N \\leq 0\n    $$\n\nThe complete optimization problem is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{minimize} \\quad  J(y_1, g, N) = N + \\alpha H y_1^{-1} g^{1-N} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad  \\delta_{\\max} - y_1 \\frac{g^N - 1}{g - 1} \\leq 0 \\\\\n y_{\\min} - y_1 \\leq 0 \\\\\n y_1 - y_{\\max} \\leq 0 \\\\\n 1 - g \\leq 0 \\\\\n g - g_{\\mathrm{qual}} \\leq 0 \\\\\n 1 - N \\leq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) Conditions\n\nLet the Lagrange multipliers (dual variables) for the inequality constraints $c_1, \\dots, c_6$ be $\\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_6$, respectively. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ for this problem is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}(y_1, g, N, \\mu_1, \\dots, \\mu_6) =  J(y_1, g, N) + \\mu_1 \\left( \\delta_{\\max} - y_1 \\frac{g^N - 1}{g - 1} \\right) + \\mu_2(y_{\\min} - y_1) \\\\\n + \\mu_3(y_1 - y_{\\max}) + \\mu_4(1 - g) + \\mu_5(g - g_{\\mathrm{qual}}) + \\mu_6(1 - N)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe KKT conditions consist of stationarity, primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and complementary slackness.\n\n**Stationarity Conditions ($\\nabla_{y_1, g, N} \\mathcal{L} = 0$):**\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_1} = -\\alpha H y_1^{-2} g^{1-N} - \\mu_1 \\frac{g^N - 1}{g-1} - \\mu_2 + \\mu_3 = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial g} = -\\alpha H (N-1) y_1^{-1} g^{-N} - \\mu_1 y_1 \\frac{N g^{N-1}(g-1) - (g^N-1)}{(g-1)^2} - \\mu_4 + \\mu_5 = 0$\n3.  $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial N} = 1 - \\alpha H y_1^{-1} g^{1-N} \\ln(g) - \\mu_1 y_1 \\frac{g^N \\ln(g)}{g-1} - \\mu_6 = 0$\n\n**Primal Feasibility:**\nThe six inequality constraints listed in Part 1 must hold at the optimal point $(y_1^{\\star}, g^{\\star}, N^{\\star})$.\n\n**Dual Feasibility:**\nAll Lagrange multipliers must be non-negative:\n$$\n\\mu_i \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{for } i=1, 2, \\dots, 6\n$$\n\n**Complementary Slackness:**\nFor each constraint, either the multiplier is zero or the constraint is active (holds with equality).\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_1 \\left( \\delta_{\\max} - y_1 \\frac{g^N - 1}{g - 1} \\right) = 0 \\\\\n\\mu_2(y_{\\min} - y_1) = 0 \\\\\n\\mu_3(y_1 - y_{\\max}) = 0 \\\\\n\\mu_4(1 - g) = 0 \\\\\n\\mu_5(g - g_{\\mathrm{qual}}) = 0 \\\\\n\\mu_6(1 - N) = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Solution for the Optimal Growth Rate $g^{\\star}$\n\nWe analyze the KKT conditions and properties of the objective function to find the optimal solution. The provided numerical parameters are: $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $u_{\\tau} = 0.8 \\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\delta_{\\max} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$, $H = 0.30 \\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 100$, and $g_{\\mathrm{qual}} = 1.22$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the bounds on $y_1$:\n$y_{\\min} = 0.5 \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.8} = 9.375 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$y_{\\max} = 2.0 \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.8} = 3.75 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\n1.  **Determination of $y_1^{\\star}$:** The partial derivative of the objective function with respect to $y_1$ is $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial y_1} = -\\alpha H y_1^{-2} g^{1-N}$. Since $\\alpha  0$, $H  0$, and $g \\geq 1$, this derivative is strictly negative. This implies that $J$ is a strictly decreasing function of $y_1$. To minimize $J$, we must choose the largest possible value for $y_1$ allowed by the constraints. The upper bound on $y_1$ is $y_{\\max}$. Thus, the optimal first-layer thickness is $y_1^{\\star} = y_{\\max}$.\n    From complementary slackness, since $y_1^{\\star} = y_{\\max}  y_{\\min}$, the constraint $c_3$ is active ($\\mu_3  0$) and $c_2$ is inactive ($\\mu_2 = 0$).\n\n2.  **Analysis of $N^{\\star}$ and $g^{\\star}$:** The constraint $c_1$ with $y_1=y_{\\max}$ becomes $y_{\\max} \\sum_{i=1}^N g^{i-1} \\ge \\delta_{\\max}$. If $N=1$, this is $y_{\\max} \\ge \\delta_{\\max}$, or $3.75 \\times 10^{-5} \\ge 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}$, which is false. Therefore, any feasible solution must have $N  1$. By continuity, the optimal solution must have $N^{\\star} \\ge 1$. Since $N^{\\star}$ will be greater than $1$, the constraint $c_6: 1-N \\leq 0$ is inactive, so $\\mu_6=0$.\n    Similarly, the case $g=1$ can be analyzed. It leads to a very large number of cells and a high cost, and the derivatives required for the KKT conditions are ill-defined. We seek a solution with $g1$. For $g^{\\star}1$, the constraint $c_4: 1-g \\leq 0$ is inactive, so $\\mu_4=0$.\n\n3.  **Determination of $g^{\\star}$:** With $\\mu_4 = 0$, the stationarity condition for $g$ simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\mu_5 = \\alpha H (N-1) y_1^{-1} g^{-N} + \\mu_1 y_1 \\frac{N g^{N-1}(g-1) - (g^N-1)}{(g-1)^2}\n    $$\n    Let's analyze the sign of the terms on the right-hand side.\n    -   First term: $\\alpha H (N-1) y_1^{-1} g^{-N}$. Since $\\alpha, H, y_1$ are positive, $g1$ and we concluded $N1$, this term is strictly positive.\n    -   Second term: Let $S_g = \\frac{N g^{N-1}(g-1) - (g^N-1)}{(g-1)^2}$. We need to determine the sign of $S_g$. Let $f(g) = Ng^{N-1}(g-1) - (g^N-1) = (N-1)g^N - Ng^{N-1} + 1$. At $g=1$, $f(1)=(N-1)-N+1=0$. The derivative is $f'(g) = N(N-1)g^{N-1} - N(N-1)g^{N-2} = N(N-1)g^{N-2}(g-1)$. For $N1$ and $g1$, $f'(g)  0$. This means $f(g)$ is strictly increasing for $g1$. Since $f(1)=0$, we have $f(g)  0$ for all $g1$. Consequently, $S_g  0$ for $g1, N1$.\n\n    The expression for $\\mu_5$ is:\n    $$\n    \\mu_5 = \\underbrace{\\alpha H (N-1) y_1^{-1} g^{-N}}_{0} + \\underbrace{\\mu_1}_{\\ge 0} \\underbrace{y_1}_{0} \\underbrace{S_g}_{0}\n    $$\n    The first term is strictly positive, and the second term is non-negative. Therefore, their sum must be strictly positive:\n    $$\n    \\mu_5  0\n    $$\n    According to the KKT complementary slackness condition $\\mu_5(g - g_{\\mathrm{qual}}) = 0$, if $\\mu_5  0$, then the constraint $c_5$ must be active at the optimum.\n    $$\n    g^{\\star} - g_{\\mathrm{qual}} = 0\n    $$\n    This implies that the optimal growth rate is the maximum value allowed by the quality constraint:\n    $$\n    g^{\\star} = g_{\\mathrm{qual}}\n    $$\n    This result is also supported by a monotonicity analysis. If we express $N$ as a function of $g$ using an active boundary-layer constraint, both the number of layers $N(g)$ and the hexahedral cost term $\\alpha H / (y_1 g^{N(g)-1})$ can be shown to be decreasing functions of $g$ for the given parameters. Therefore, the total cost $J$ is a decreasing function of $g$, and its minimum must occur at the highest possible value of $g$, which is $g_{\\mathrm{qual}}$.\n\nThe problem supplies $g_{\\mathrm{qual}} = 1.22$. Therefore, the optimal growth rate is $g^{\\star} = 1.22$. The question asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$g^{\\star} = 1.220$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.220}$$"
