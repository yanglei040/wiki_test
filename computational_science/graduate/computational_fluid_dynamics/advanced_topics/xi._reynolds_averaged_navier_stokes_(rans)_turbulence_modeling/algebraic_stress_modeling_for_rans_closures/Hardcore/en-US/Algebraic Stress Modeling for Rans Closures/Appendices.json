It is a standard, well-posed problem in theoretical fluid dynamics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to derive the production term for the turbulent kinetic energy, $k$, and then evaluate it for the specified flow field. The production of turbulent kinetic energy, denoted as $P_k$, represents the rate at which energy is transferred from the mean flow to the turbulent fluctuations through the work done by the Reynolds stresses against the mean velocity gradients.\n\nWe can derive the expression for $P_k$ by considering the kinetic energy budget of the mean flow. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for an incompressible fluid are given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial t} + \\bar{U}_j \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{P}}{\\partial x_i} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_j} - \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u'_i u'_j}}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nHere, $\\bar{U}_i$ are the components of the mean velocity vector, $\\bar{P}$ is the mean pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\\overline{u'_i u'_j} = R_{ij}$ is the Reynolds stress tensor.\n\nTo derive the equation for the mean flow kinetic energy, $K = \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{U}_i\\bar{U}_i$, we multiply the RANS equation by $\\bar{U}_i$:\n$$\n\\bar{U}_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial t} + \\bar{U}_j \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j} \\right) = \\frac{D K}{Dt} = -\\frac{\\bar{U}_i}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{P}}{\\partial x_i} + \\nu \\bar{U}_i \\frac{\\partial^2 \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_j} - \\bar{U}_i \\frac{\\partial R_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nThe last term on the right-hand side, $-\\bar{U}_i \\frac{\\partial R_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}$, represents the rate of work done by the Reynolds stresses on the mean flow. Using the product rule for derivatives, this term can be expanded as:\n$$\n-\\bar{U}_i \\frac{\\partial R_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} = - \\frac{\\partial (\\bar{U}_i R_{ij})}{\\partial x_j} + R_{ij} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nThe term $- \\frac{\\partial (\\bar{U}_i R_{ij})}{\\partial x_j}$ is a transport term representing the spatial redistribution of mean kinetic energy by the turbulent stresses. The term $R_{ij} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j}$ represents an energy exchange between the mean flow and the turbulent fluctuations. Specifically, it is the rate per unit volume at which mean kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy. In the context of the mean energy equation, this term is typically negative (a loss for the mean flow) and converted into turbulent kinetic energy.\n\nBy the principle of energy conservation, the loss of energy from the mean flow to the turbulent field must equal the gain of energy by the turbulent field. Therefore, the production of turbulent kinetic energy, $P_k$, is the negative of the energy transfer term from the mean energy equation:\n$$\nP_k = -R_{ij} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nThis expression is the general form of the TKE production term, which completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute this term for the given mean velocity field, $\\bar{\\boldsymbol U}=(S y,0,0)$. In Cartesian index notation, with $x_1=x$, $x_2=y$, and $x_3=z$, the mean velocity components are:\n$$\n\\bar{U}_1 = S x_2, \\quad \\bar{U}_2 = 0, \\quad \\bar{U}_3 = 0\n$$\nWe need to find the components of the mean velocity gradient tensor, $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j}$.\nFor $i=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_1} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}(S x_2) = S, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_3} = 0\n$$\nFor $i=2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_2}{\\partial x_1} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_2}{\\partial x_2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_2}{\\partial x_3} = 0\n$$\nFor $i=3$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_3}{\\partial x_1} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_3}{\\partial x_2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_3}{\\partial x_3} = 0\n$$\nThe only non-zero component of the mean velocity gradient tensor is $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_2} = S$.\n\nNow, we substitute these gradients into the expression for $P_k$. The summation over indices $i$ and $j$ is:\n$$\nP_k = -R_{ij} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j} = - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} R_{ij} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nSince all components of $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_i}{\\partial x_j}$ are zero except for the case where $i=1$ and $j=2$, the double summation collapses to a single term:\n$$\nP_k = - \\left( R_{11}\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_1} + R_{12}\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_2} + R_{13}\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_3} + R_{21}\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_2}{\\partial x_1} + \\dots \\right) = - R_{12} \\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_2}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of the non-zero gradient, $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{U}_1}{\\partial x_2} = S$:\n$$\nP_k = -R_{12} S\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the production of turbulent kinetic energy for the given plane shear flow, expressed solely in terms of the shear stress component $R_{12}$ and the shear rate $S$. Physically, in this flow, $S0$ and the shear stress $R_{12} = \\overline{u'_1 u'_2}$ is typically negative, making $P_k$ positive, which signifies a gain of energy by the turbulent motion.",
