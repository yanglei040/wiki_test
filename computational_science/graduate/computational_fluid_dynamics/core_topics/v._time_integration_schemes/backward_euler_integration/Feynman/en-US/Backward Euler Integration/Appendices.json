            "solution": "The problem requires the formulation, analysis, and implementation of two numerical schemes for the one-dimensional linear advection–diffusion equation on a periodic domain. The validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained, with all necessary parameters, equations, and methods clearly specified. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### 1. Problem Formulation and Spatial Discretization\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is the linear advection–diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nfor $x \\in [0,L]$ and $t \\ge 0$, with advection coefficient $a \\ge 0$, viscosity $\\nu \\ge 0$, and periodic boundary conditions. The initial condition is given by a single sinusoidal mode:\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\sin(2\\pi k_0 x)\n$$\n\nWe discretize the spatial domain $[0,L]$ using a uniform grid of $N$ points $x_j = j \\Delta x$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, with grid spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$. Let $u_j(t)$ be the numerical approximation of $u(x_j, t)$.\n\nThe spatial derivatives are approximated using finite differences as specified:\n- The first-order advection derivative is approximated using the first-order upwind scheme (since $a \\ge 0$):\n$$\na \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x_j} \\approx a \\frac{u_j(t) - u_{j-1}(t)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n- The second-order diffusion derivative is approximated using the second-order centered difference scheme:\n$$\n\\nu \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\right)_{x_j} \\approx \\nu \\frac{u_{j+1}(t) - 2u_j(t) + u_{j-1}(t)}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nDue to the periodic boundary conditions, indices are taken modulo $N$, i.e., $u_{-1} \\equiv u_{N-1}$ and $u_N \\equiv u_0$.\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the PDE yields a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a technique known as the method of lines:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_j}{dt} = -a \\left(\\frac{u_j - u_{j-1}}{\\Delta x}\\right) + \\nu \\left(\\frac{u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1}}{\\Delta x^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis system can be written in matrix form as:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = -a D_{\\text{up}} \\mathbf{u} + \\nu D_2 \\mathbf{u} \\equiv \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{u})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}(t) = [u_0(t), u_1(t), \\dots, u_{N-1}(t)]^T$, and $D_{\\text{up}}$ and $D_2$ are the circulant matrices representing the upwind first-derivative and centered second-derivative operators, respectively.\n\n### 2. Time Integration Schemes\n\nWe discretize in time using a uniform time step $\\Delta t$. Let $\\mathbf{u}^n$ denote the solution vector at time $t^n = n \\Delta t$.\n\n**a) IMEX Backward Euler–Forward Euler Scheme**\nThis scheme treats the diffusion term implicitly (using backward Euler for stability) and the advection term explicitly (using forward Euler for simplicity). The update from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{u}^n}{\\Delta t} = -a D_{\\text{up}} \\mathbf{u}^n + \\nu D_2 \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the unknown state $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \\Delta t \\nu D_2 \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^n - \\Delta t a D_{\\text{up}} \\mathbf{u}^n\n$$\n$$\n\\big(I - \\Delta t \\nu D_2\\big) \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\big(I - \\Delta t a D_{\\text{up}}\\big) \\mathbf{u}^n\n$$\nThis matches the form given in the problem statement.\n\n**b) Fully Implicit Backward Euler Scheme**\nThis scheme treats both advection and diffusion terms implicitly:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{u}^n}{\\Delta t} = -a D_{\\text{up}} \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} + \\nu D_2 \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} + \\Delta t a D_{\\text{up}} \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \\Delta t \\nu D_2 \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^n\n$$\n$$\n\\big(I + \\Delta t a D_{\\text{up}} - \\Delta t \\nu D_2\\big) \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^n\n$$\nThis also matches the form provided.\n\n### 3. Von Neumann Stability Analysis of the IMEX Scheme\n\nTo derive the stability restriction, we perform a von Neumann analysis. We substitute a single Fourier mode $u_j^n = G^n e^{ikx_j} = G^n e^{ij\\theta}$ into the discretized IMEX update rule, where $G$ is the amplification factor, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $\\theta = k\\Delta x$ is the normalized wavenumber.\n\nThe discrete update rule for a single component $u_j$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t} = -a \\left( \\frac{u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta x} \\right) + \\nu \\left( \\frac{u_{j+1}^{n+1} - 2u_j^{n+1} + u_{j-1}^{n+1}}{\\Delta x^2} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the Fourier mode:\n$$\n\\frac{G - 1}{\\Delta t} e^{ij\\theta} = -a \\left( \\frac{e^{ij\\theta} - e^{i(j-1)\\theta}}{\\Delta x} \\right) + \\nu G \\left( \\frac{e^{i(j+1)\\theta} - 2e^{ij\\theta} + e^{i(j-1)\\theta}}{\\Delta x^2} \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $e^{ij\\theta}$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{G - 1}{\\Delta t} = -a \\left( \\frac{1 - e^{-i\\theta}}{\\Delta x} \\right) + \\nu G \\left( \\frac{e^{i\\theta} - 2 + e^{-i\\theta}}{\\Delta x^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be written using the symbols (eigenvalues) of the difference operators, $\\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta)$ and $\\widehat{D_2}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{G - 1}{\\Delta t} = -a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta) + \\nu G \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta)\n$$\nSolving for the amplification factor $G(\\theta)$:\n$$\nG(1 - \\Delta t \\nu \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta)) = 1 - \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta) \\implies G(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta)}{1 - \\Delta t \\nu \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta)}\n$$\nFor stability, we require $|G(\\theta)| \\le 1$ for all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nLet's analyze the denominator. The symbol for the second derivative is $\\widehat{D_2}(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{i\\theta} - 2 + e^{-i\\theta}}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{2\\cos\\theta - 2}{\\Delta x^2} = -\\frac{4\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{\\Delta x^2}$. This is a real and non-positive value for all $\\theta$. Since $\\Delta t \\ge 0$ and $\\nu \\ge 0$, the denominator $1 - \\Delta t \\nu \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta) = 1 + \\Delta t \\nu \\frac{4\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{\\Delta x^2}$ is real and always greater than or equal to $1$. This proves that the implicit treatment of the diffusion term is unconditionally stable and does not itself impose a restriction on $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe stability condition $|G(\\theta)| \\le 1$ becomes $|1 - \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta)| \\le |1 - \\Delta t \\nu \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta)|$. Since the denominator's magnitude is at least $1$, a sufficient condition for stability is that the numerator's magnitude is at most $1$:\n$$\n|1 - \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta)| \\le 1\n$$\nLet $C = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ be the Courant number. The numerator is:\n$1 - \\Delta t a \\frac{1 - e^{-i\\theta}}{\\Delta x} = 1 - C(1 - \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) = (1 - C + C\\cos\\theta) - iC\\sin\\theta$.\nThe squared magnitude is:\n$$\n|1 - \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta)|^2 = (1 - C + C\\cos\\theta)^2 + (-C\\sin\\theta)^2\n$$\n$$\n= (1-C)^2 + 2C(1-C)\\cos\\theta + C^2\\cos^2\\theta + C^2\\sin^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\n= 1 - 2C + C^2 + 2C\\cos\\theta - 2C^2\\cos\\theta + C^2 = 1 - 2C(1-\\cos\\theta) + 2C^2(1-\\cos\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n= 1 + 2(C^2-C)(1-\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nFor this to be less than or equal to $1$, we need $2(C^2-C)(1-\\cos\\theta) \\le 0$. Since $1-\\cos\\theta \\ge 0$, this requires $C^2 - C \\le 0$, or $C(C-1) \\le 0$. As $a \\ge 0$, we have $C \\ge 0$, so the condition simplifies to $C \\le 1$.\n$$\n\\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1 \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta x}{a}\n$$\nFor a general $a$, the analysis would involve $|a|$, leading to the final stability restriction for the explicit advection part:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|}\n$$\n\n### 4. Implementation in Fourier Space\n\nThe matrices $D_{\\text{up}}$ and $D_2$ are circulant, which means they are diagonalized by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Applying the DFT to the time-stepping equations transforms the system of linear algebraic equations into a set of independent scalar equations, one for each Fourier mode. Let $\\widehat{\\mathbf{u}}$ be the DFT of $\\mathbf{u}$.\n\nThe IMEX update in Fourier space becomes:\n$$\n\\big(1 - \\Delta t \\nu \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta_m)\\big) \\widehat{u}_m^{n+1} = \\big(1 - \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta_m)\\big) \\widehat{u}_m^n\n$$\n$$\n\\widehat{u}_m^{n+1} = \\frac{1 - \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta_m)}{1 - \\Delta t \\nu \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta_m)} \\widehat{u}_m^n\n$$\n\nThe fully implicit update in Fourier space becomes:\n$$\n\\big(1 + \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta_m) - \\Delta t \\nu \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta_m)\\big) \\widehat{u}_m^{n+1} = \\widehat{u}_m^n\n$$\n$$\n\\widehat{u}_m^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta t a \\widehat{D_{\\text{up}}}(\\theta_m) - \\Delta t \\nu \\widehat{D_2}(\\theta_m)} \\widehat{u}_m^n\n$$\nHere, $\\theta_m = 2\\pi m / N$ for the discrete frequency index $m$. The simulation proceeds by initializing $\\widehat{\\mathbf{u}}^0 = \\text{DFT}(\\mathbf{u}(t=0))$, and then repeatedly applying the appropriate scalar update rule to all Fourier coefficients for the chosen number of time steps. Finally, the solution in physical space is recovered via an inverse DFT.\n\nThe error is computed against the exact solution, $u_\\text{exact}(x,t) = \\exp(-\\nu (2\\pi k_0)^2 t) \\sin(2\\pi k_0 (x - a t))$, using the discrete $L^2$ norm:\n$$\n\\|e\\|_2 = \\left(\\Delta x \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\big(u_j(T) - u_\\text{exact}(x_j,T)\\big)^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe implementation will follow this Fourier-based algorithm for each test case specified in the problem.",
