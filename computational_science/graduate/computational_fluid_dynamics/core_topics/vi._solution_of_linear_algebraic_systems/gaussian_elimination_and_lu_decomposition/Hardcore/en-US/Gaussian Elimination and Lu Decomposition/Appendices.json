This is a fundamental algorithm in scientific computing, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The context provided about the physical origin of the system (convection-diffusion equation) is appropriate and realistic. The problem is mathematically and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. The matrix $A$ is non-singular (its determinant is $5(25 - 4) - (-1)(-20) = 5(21) - 20 = 85 \\neq 0$), guaranteeing a unique solution to the linear system. The instructions to perform forward elimination without pivoting constitute a well-defined, unambiguous algorithm.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** All necessary information (matrix $A$, vector $\\boldsymbol{b}$, and the procedure) is provided. There are no contradictions.\n- **No other flaws are present.** The problem is neither unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, nor unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to transform the linear system $A \\boldsymbol{T} = \\boldsymbol{b}$ into an equivalent upper-triangular system $U \\boldsymbol{T} = \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{b}}$ using forward elimination.

The pivot element is the new entry in the $(2,2)$ position, $a'_{22} = \\frac{21}{5}$.\n\nTo eliminate the entry $a'_{32} = -4$, we define the multiplier $m_{32} = \\frac{a'_{32}}{a'_{22}}$.\n$$\nm_{32} = \\frac{-4}{\\frac{21}{5}} = -4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{21} = -\\frac{20}{21}\n$$\nThe corresponding row operation is $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - m_{32} R_2$, or $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 + \\frac{20}{21} R_2$.\nApplying this to the third row of the matrix $[A | \\boldsymbol{b}]^{(1)}$:\n- New element in position $(3,1)$: $0 + \\frac{20}{21}(0) = 0$.\n- New element in position $(3,2)$: $-4 + \\frac{20}{21}\\left(\\frac{21}{5}\\right) = -4 + \\frac{20}{5} = -4 + 4 = 0$.\n- New element in position $(3,3)$: $5 + \\frac{20}{21}(-1) = 5 - \\frac{20}{21} = \\frac{105-20}{21} = \\frac{85}{21}$.\n- New element in the right-hand side vector: $2 + \\frac{20}{21}\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = 2 + \\frac{80}{105} = 2 + \\frac{16}{21} = \\frac{42+16}{21} = \\frac{58}{21}$.\n\nThe forward elimination process is now complete. The final augmented matrix $[U | \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{b}}]$ is:\n$$\n[U | \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{b}}] = \\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n5 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{21}{5} & -1 & \\frac{4}{5} \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{85}{21} & \\frac{58}{21}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nThe resulting upper-triangular matrix $U$ and transformed right-hand side vector $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{b}}$ are:\n$$\nU = \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{21}{5} & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{85}{21}\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{b}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n\\frac{4}{5} \\\\\n\\frac{58}{21}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe multipliers identified during the process are:\n- $m_{21} = -\\frac{4}{5}$\n- $m_{31} = 0$\n- $m_{32} = -\\frac{20}{21}$\n\nThe problem asks for the exact value of the second-stage multiplier $m_{32}$.\nThe value is $-\\frac{20}{21}$.",

The resulting upper-triangular matrix, denoted $U$, is\n$$\nU \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\varepsilon & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1+2\\varepsilon}{1+\\varepsilon} & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1+3\\varepsilon}{1+2\\varepsilon} & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1+3\\varepsilon} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe final pivot is the $(4,4)$ diagonal entry of $U$, which is $u_{44}(\\varepsilon)$.\n$$\nu_{44}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1+3\\varepsilon}.\n$$\n\n**Analysis of the Limiting Behavior**\nThe limiting behavior of $u_{44}(\\varepsilon)$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}$ is\n$$\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}} u_{44}(\\varepsilon) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1+3\\varepsilon} = \\frac{0}{1+0} = 0.\n$$\nThis behavior is a direct consequence of the singularity of the original matrix $A$. The determinant of a matrix is the product of the pivots obtained during Gaussian elimination (up to a sign determined by row swaps). Since no row swaps were needed, $\\det(A_{\\varepsilon}) = u_{11}u_{22}u_{33}u_{44}$.\n$$\n\\det(A_{\\varepsilon}) = (1+\\varepsilon)\\left(\\frac{1+2\\varepsilon}{1+\\varepsilon}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+3\\varepsilon}{1+2\\varepsilon}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{1+3\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\varepsilon.\n$$\nAs $\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}$, $A_{\\varepsilon} \\to A$, and $\\det(A_{\\varepsilon}) \\to \\det(A)$. The limit $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\det(A_{\\varepsilon})=0$ confirms that $\\det(A)=0$, so $A$ is a singular matrix.\nThe rank of a matrix is equal to the number of non-zero pivots produced by Gaussian elimination. For any $\\varepsilon>0$, all four pivots of $A_{\\varepsilon}$ are non-zero, so $\\text{rank}(A_{\\varepsilon})=4$. However, in the limit $\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}$, the pivots of $A_{\\varepsilon}$ converge to the pivots of $A$:\n$$\nu_{11} \\to 1, \\quad u_{22} \\to 1, \\quad u_{33} \\to 1, \\quad u_{44} \\to 0.\n$$\nThe emergence of a zero pivot in the final position for the matrix $A$ indicates that its rank is $3$. For an $n \\times n$ matrix, a rank of $r < n$ implies that the dimension of its nullspace is $n-r$. For the $4 \\times 4$ matrix $A$, a rank of $3$ means its nullspace has dimension $4-3=1$. This is perfectly consistent with the problem statement that $A$ is rank-deficient with a one-dimensional nullspace. The quantity $u_{44}(\\varepsilon)$ approaching zero is the numerical signature of $A_{\\varepsilon}$ being a small perturbation of a singular matrix.",
