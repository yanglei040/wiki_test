For a given $s$, integrate from $\\eta=0$ to a sufficiently large $\\eta_{\\infty}$ (e.g., $\\eta_{\\infty}\\approx 8$ to $\\eta_{\\infty}\\approx 12$) using an adaptive Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver with error control. Define the residual $R(s)=y_{2}(\\eta_{\\infty};s)-1$. Update $s$ by a root-finding method applied to $R$, such as a secant iteration using two previous iterates or a Newton iteration that computes $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s$ via the sensitivity ODE $w_{1}'=w_{2}$, $w_{2}'=w_{3}$, $w_{3}'= -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,(w_{1}\\,y_{3}+y_{1}\\,w_{3})$, initialized by $w_{1}(0)=0$, $w_{2}(0)=0$, $w_{3}(0)=1$, so that $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s = w_{2}(\\eta_{\\infty})$.

The governing partial differential equations are the correct boundary layer approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations for this flow regime. The similarity transformation and the resulting Blasius ODE are standard, textbook-correct derivations. All stated physics and mathematics are well-established and factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The Blasius problem, consisting of the third-order ODE and the three specified boundary conditions, is a well-posed boundary value problem (BVP) known to possess a unique solution. The task of finding the unknown initial condition $f''(0)$ via a numerical shooting method is a standard and valid technique for converting such a BVP into a sequence of initial value problems (IVPs).\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical language.

The setup is self-consistent.\n5.  **Other Flaws**: The problem is not trivial, metaphorical, or unrealistic within the context of theoretical and computational fluid dynamics. It represents a canonical problem that tests fundamental understanding of numerical methods for boundary value problems.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and the evaluation of the provided options.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe task is to solve the third-order boundary value problem for $f(\\eta)$:\n$$f''' + \\frac{1}{2} f f'' = 0$$\nsubject to the boundary conditions:\n$$f(0) = 0$$\n$$f'(0) = 0$$\n$$f'(\\eta \\to \\infty) = 1$$\nThis is a BVP because conditions are specified at two different points, $\\eta=0$ and $\\eta\\to\\infty$. The shooting method is an appropriate technique for solving this.\n\nThe core idea of the shooting method is to convert the BVP into an initial value problem (IVP) by guessing the missing initial conditions at one boundary, integrating to the other boundary, and then using an iterative root-finding algorithm to adjust the initial guess until the conditions at the second boundary are met.\n\nFor this third-order ODE, we need three initial conditions at $\\eta=0$. We are given $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=0$. The missing condition is $f''(0)$. We introduce a shooting parameter, $s$, for this unknown value:\n$$f''(0) = s$$\n\nWith these three conditions, we can formulate an IVP. It is standard practice to convert the third-order ODE into a system of three first-order ODEs. Let $y_1 = f$, $y_2 = f'$, and $y_3 = f''$. The system is:\n$$y_1' = \\frac{dy_1}{d\\eta} = f' = y_2$$\n$$y_2' = \\frac{dy_2}{d\\eta} = f'' = y_3$$\n$$y_3' = \\frac{dy_3}{d\\eta} = f''' = -\\frac{1}{2} f f'' = -\\frac{1}{2} y_1 y_3$$\nThe initial conditions for this system at $\\eta=0$ are:\n$$y_1(0) = f(0) = 0$$\n$$y_2(0) = f'(0) = 0$$\n$$y_3(0) = f''(0) = s$$\n\nThe shooting procedure is as follows:\n1.  Choose an initial guess for $s$.\n2.  Solve the IVP system from $\\eta=0$ to a sufficiently large but finite value $\\eta_{\\infty}$, which approximates the infinite domain. The solution depends on the choice of $s$, so we can write it as $y_2(\\eta_{\\infty}; s)$.\n3.  The condition that must be satisfied at the far-field boundary is $f'(\\eta\\to\\infty)=1$, which translates to $y_2(\\eta_{\\infty})=1$.\n4.  Define a residual function, $R(s)$, representing the error in satisfying this condition:\n    $$R(s) = y_2(\\eta_{\\infty}; s) - 1$$\n5.  The problem now is to find the root of $R(s)=0$. This can be done using a numerical root-finding algorithm, such as the secant method or Newton's method, which iteratively updates the guess for $s$ until $|R(s)|$ is smaller than a prescribed tolerance $\\varepsilon$.\n\nNow, let us evaluate each option based on this correct procedure.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis option correctly outlines the procedure described above.\n*   It correctly converts the Blasius ODE into the first-order system: $y_{1}'=y_{2}$, $y_{2}'=y_{3}$, $y_{3}'= -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,y_{1}\\,y_{3}$.\n*   It correctly states the initial conditions for the IVP: $y_{1}(0)=0$, $y_{2}(0)=0$, and $y_{3}(0)=s$.\n*   It proposes integrating to a large $\\eta_{\\infty}$ (e.g., $8$ to $12$), which is an appropriate range for the Blasius solution to have converged to its asymptotic state. It correctly recommends an adaptive ODE solver with error control, which is the best practice for ensuring accuracy and efficiency.\n*   It defines the correct residual function $R(s)=y_{2}(\\eta_{\\infty};s)-1$, which directly measures the mismatch with the required far-field boundary condition.\n*   It suggests appropriate root-finding algorithms (secant or Newton). For the Newton method, it provides the correct formulation of the sensitivity (or variational) equations needed to compute the derivative $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s$. The derivation of the sensitivity equations for $w_i = \\partial y_i/\\partial s$ and their initial conditions is perfectly accurate. This demonstrates a high level of computational expertise.\n*   Finally, it includes the check that $y_3(\\eta) \\to 0$ for large $\\eta$ as a verification of the choice of $\\eta_{\\infty}$, which is a sound practice. If $y_2(\\eta) \\to 1$, its derivative $y_3(\\eta)$ must approach $0$.\nThis option describes a complete, correct, robust, and sophisticated numerical shooting strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:**\nThis option proposes a backward integration from $\\eta=\\eta_{\\infty}$ to $\\eta=0$.\n*   The shooting parameter here is $f(\\eta_{\\infty})$, with $f'(\\eta_{\\infty}) = 1$ and $f''(\\eta_{\\infty}) = 0$ assumed as starting conditions. The goal is to satisfy the two conditions at the wall, $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=0$.\n*   The fundamental flaw in this approach is numerical instability. The Blasius equation, when integrated backward in $\\eta$, exhibits exponential growth of errors. A small perturbation in the initial guess for $f(\\eta_{\\infty})$ will be greatly amplified by the time the integration reaches $\\eta=0$. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a converged and accurate solution. Forward integration from $\\eta=0$ is the stable direction.\n*   Additionally, it suggests a fixed-step ODE solver, which is generally inferior to an adaptive solver for problems of this nature.\nThis strategy is not computationally sound or robust.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option proposes a forward integration, which is correct, but uses a flawed residual function.\n*   The residual is defined as $R(s) = f(\\eta_{\\infty};s) - \\eta_{\\infty}$.\n*   This is based on the incorrect assumption that $f(\\eta) \\to \\eta$ as $\\eta \\to \\infty$. The correct asymptotic behavior of the Blasius solution is $f(\\eta) \\sim \\eta - \\beta$ for large $\\eta$, where $\\beta \\approx 1.7207$ is a constant related to the displacement thickness. The value of $\\beta$ is not known *a priori*; it is a result of the solution.\n*   Targeting $f(\\eta_{\\infty}) = \\eta_{\\infty}$ will lead to an incorrect solution because it ignores the non-zero asymptotic displacement of the streamfunction. The shooting method must enforce the actual boundary condition given in the problem, which is $f'(\\eta\\to\\infty)=1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:**\nThis option also proposes forward integration but uses another flawed residual function.\n*   The residual is defined as $R(s) = y_{3}(\\eta_{\\infty};s) = f''(\\eta_{\\infty};s)$. The goal is to drive this residual to $0$.\n*   While it is true that for the correct solution, $f''(\\eta \\to \\infty) = 0$, this condition is not sufficient to determine the correct value of $s$. For any positive initial guess $s=f''(0)>0$, the resulting velocity profile $f'(\\eta)$ will be monotonically increasing and concave, eventually approaching some constant value $C$. As soon as $f'(\\eta)$ approaches any constant, its derivative, $f''(\\eta)$, must approach $0$.\n*   Therefore, the condition $f''(\\eta_{\\infty})=0$ will be satisfied for a wide range of $s$ values, each leading to a different asymptotic velocity $f'(\\eta\\to\\infty)=C$. The function $R(s) = f''(\\eta_\\infty; s)$ will be very close to $0$ for all valid $s$, making it impossible for a root-finder to select the unique $s$ that yields $C=1$. The condition is necessary but not sufficient, leading to an ill-posed root-finding problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the theory of laminar boundary layers. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. It is a standard exercise in applying the Blasius similarity transformation to integral boundary layer parameters.\n\nThe primary assumption, stated in the problem, is that the flow can be described by the Blasius similarity solution for a flat-plate boundary layer. This implies the flow is steady, two-dimensional, incompressible, and laminar, with a zero streamwise pressure gradient ($\\frac{dp}{dx} = 0$). Under these conditions, the non-dimensional streamwise velocity profile $u/U_{\\infty}$ is a function of a single similarity variable $\\eta$, i.e., $\\frac{u(x,y)}{U_{\\infty}} = f'(\\eta)$.\n\nThe similarity variable $\\eta$ is defined as:\n$$ \\eta = y \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}} $$\nwhere $y$ is the wall-normal coordinate, $x$ is the streamwise coordinate, $U_{\\infty}$ is the free-stream velocity, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.\n\nOur objective is to re-express the integral definitions of displacement thickness, $\\delta^{*}(x)$, and momentum thickness, $\\theta(x)$, in terms of the similarity variable $\\eta$. This requires a change of the integration variable from $y$ to $\\eta$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the differentials $dy$ and $d\\eta$. Treating $x$ as a parameter for the integration with respect to $y$, we differentiate the expression for $\\eta$ with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\eta}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(y \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}} $$\nRearranging this expression gives the relationship for $dy$:\n$$ dy = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}} d\\eta $$\n\nNext, we must transform the limits of integration. The original integrals are over the domain $y \\in [0, \\infty)$.\nWhen $y=0$, the similarity variable is $\\eta = 0 \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}} = 0$.\nAs $y \\to \\infty$, the similarity variable is $\\eta \\to \\infty$.\nThus, the limits of integration in the transformed coordinate system are $\\eta \\in [0, \\infty)$.\n\nWe now proceed to derive the expression for the displacement thickness, $\\delta^{*}(x)$.

The integral is dimensionless since $\\eta$ and $f'(\\eta)$ are dimensionless. Thus, $\\delta^{*}(x)$ has units of length, as expected for a thickness. The SI unit for this quantity would be meters.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the momentum thickness, $\\theta(x)$.

Furthermore, for a zero pressure gradient flow, the boundary-layer equation at the wall ($y=0$) simplifies to $\\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}|_{y=0}=0$. The provided profile also satisfies this condition, as $f''(\\eta)=-12\\eta+12\\eta^2 \\implies f''(0)=0$. This makes the chosen profile physically appropriate for this problem.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe von Kármán momentum-integral equation for a steady, two-dimensional, incompressible boundary layer with zero pressure gradient ($\\frac{dp}{dx}=0$) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho U_{\\infty}^2} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_w$ is the wall shear stress and $\\theta$ is the momentum thickness, defined as:\n$$\n\\theta(x) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}} \\left(1 - \\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}}\\right) dy\n$$\nUsing the definitions of the skin-friction coefficient $C_f = \\frac{2\\tau_w}{\\rho U_{\\infty}^2}$ and the approximate velocity profile $\\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}} = f(\\eta)$ which is zero for $y > \\delta(x)$ (or $\\eta > 1$), we have:\n$$\n\\frac{C_f}{2} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\n$$\nThe momentum thickness can be expressed in terms of the boundary layer thickness $\\delta(x)$ and the non-dimensional profile $f(\\eta)$ where $\\eta = y/\\delta(x)$ and $dy = \\delta d\\eta$:\n$$\n\\theta(x) = \\int_0^{\\delta} f(\\eta) (1 - f(\\eta)) dy = \\delta(x) \\int_0^1 (f(\\eta) - f(\\eta)^2) d\\eta\n$$\nLet's define a constant $\\alpha$ as the value of this integral:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\int_0^1 (f(\\eta) - f(\\eta)^2) d\\eta\n$$\nSo, $\\theta(x) = \\alpha \\delta(x)$. The momentum-integral equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{C_f}{2} = \\alpha \\frac{d\\delta}{dx}\n$$\nNext, we derive a second expression for $C_f$ from the definition of wall shear stress:\n$$\n\\tau_w = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)_{y=0}\n$$\nWe evaluate the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial (U_{\\infty} f(\\eta))}{\\partial y} = U_{\\infty} \\frac{df}{d\\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} = U_{\\infty} f'(\\eta) \\frac{1}{\\delta(x)}\n$$\nAt the wall ($y=0$, $\\eta=0$):\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)_{y=0} = \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta(x)} f'(0)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the $C_f$ definition:\n$$\nC_f = \\frac{2\\tau_w}{\\rho U_{\\infty}^2} = \\frac{2 \\mu}{\\rho U_{\\infty}^2} \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta(x)} f'(0) = \\frac{2\\nu}{U_{\\infty}\\delta(x)} f'(0)\n$$\nLet's define another constant $\\beta = f'(0)$. Then:\n$$\nC_f = \\frac{2\\nu\\beta}{U_{\\infty}\\delta(x)}\n$$\nWe now have a system of two equations for $\\delta(x)$ and $C_f(x)$. We can eliminate $C_f$ to find a differential equation for $\\delta(x)$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\frac{d\\delta}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} C_f = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\nu\\beta}{U_{\\infty}\\delta} \\right) = \\frac{\\nu\\beta}{U_{\\infty}\\delta}\n$$\nThis gives a separable ordinary differential equation for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta \\frac{d\\delta}{dx} = \\frac{\\nu\\beta}{\\alpha U_{\\infty}}\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$, assuming the boundary layer starts at $x=0$ (i.e., $\\delta(0)=0$):\n$$\n\\int_0^{\\delta} \\xi d\\xi = \\int_0^x \\frac{\\nu\\beta}{\\alpha U_{\\infty}} d\\chi \\implies \\frac{\\delta^2}{2} = \\frac{\\nu\\beta x}{\\alpha U_{\\infty}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\nu\\beta x}{\\alpha U_{\\infty}}}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\delta(x)$ back into the equation for $C_f$:\n$$\nC_f(x) = \\frac{2\\nu\\beta}{U_{\\infty}\\delta(x)} = \\frac{2\\nu\\beta}{U_{\\infty}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\nu\\beta x}{\\alpha U_{\\infty}}} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{2\\nu\\beta}{U_{\\infty}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha U_{\\infty}}{2\\nu\\beta x}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\nu^2\\beta^2}{U_{\\infty}^2} \\frac{\\alpha U_{\\infty}}{2\\nu\\beta x}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\alpha\\beta\\nu}{U_{\\infty}x}}\n$$\nUsing the Reynolds number $Re_x = \\frac{U_{\\infty}x}{\\nu}$, we get the final form for the integral-method skin-friction coefficient, $C_{f,\\text{int}}$:\n$$\nC_{f,\\text{int}}(Re_x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\alpha\\beta}}{\\sqrt{Re_x}}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must calculate the constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for the given profile $f(\\eta) = 2\\eta - 2\\eta^3 + \\eta^4$.\nFirst, $\\beta$:\n$$\nf'(\\eta) = 2 - 6\\eta^2 + 4\\eta^3 \\implies \\beta = f'(0) = 2\n$$\nNext, $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\int_0^1 [f(\\eta) - f(\\eta)^2] d\\eta = \\int_0^1 f(\\eta)d\\eta - \\int_0^1 f(\\eta)^2 d\\eta\n$$\nThe first integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (2\\eta - 2\\eta^3 + \\eta^4)d\\eta = \\left[ \\eta^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\eta^4 + \\frac{1}{5}\\eta^5 \\right]_0^1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{7}{10}\n$$\nThe second integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (2\\eta - 2\\eta^3 + \\eta^4)^2 d\\eta = \\int_0^1 (4\\eta^2 - 8\\eta^4 + 4\\eta^6 + 4\\eta^5 - 4\\eta^7 + \\eta^8) d\\eta\n$$\n$$\n= \\left[ \\frac{4}{3}\\eta^3 - \\frac{8}{5}\\eta^5 + \\frac{4}{7}\\eta^7 + \\frac{4}{6}\\eta^6 - \\frac{4}{8}\\eta^8 + \\frac{1}{9}\\eta^9 \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{7} + \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - \\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{7} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{9} = 2 - \\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{7} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1260 - 1008 + 360 - 315 + 70}{630} = \\frac{367}{630}\n$$\nSo, the constant $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{7}{10} - \\frac{367}{630} = \\frac{441}{630} - \\frac{367}{630} = \\frac{74}{630} = \\frac{37}{315}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerator for $C_{f,\\text{int}}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2\\alpha\\beta} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{37}{315} \\cdot 2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{148}{315}}\n$$\nThus, the integral approximation for the skin-friction coefficient is:\n$$\nC_{f,\\text{int}}(Re_x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{148/315}}{\\sqrt{Re_x}}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the relative error $\\mathcal{E}(Re_x)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(Re_{x}) = \\frac{C_{f,\\text{int}}(Re_{x}) - C_{f,\\text{Blasius}}(Re_{x})}{C_{f,\\text{Blasius}}(Re_{x})} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{148/315}}{\\sqrt{Re_x}} - \\frac{0.664}{\\sqrt{Re_x}}}{\\frac{0.664}{\\sqrt{Re_x}}}\n$$\nThe factor $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{Re_x}}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding a constant value for the relative error, independent of $Re_x$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\sqrt{148/315} - 0.664}{0.664} = \\frac{\\sqrt{148/315}}{0.664} - 1\n$$\nThis result is valid for any $Re_x$ where the flow is laminar, including the range $Re_{x} \\in [10^{4},\\,10^{6}]$.\n\nThe discrepancy between the integral approximation and the Blasius value exists because the assumed fourth-degree polynomial profile is not the exact solution to the boundary-layer equations. The Blasius solution is an exact similarity solution to the boundary-layer partial differential equations, whereas the integral method only satisfies the momentum equation in an integral sense over the boundary-layer thickness. This means that while overall momentum balance is enforced, the point-wise distribution of shear stress through the boundary layer is not exact, leading to an error in the computed wall shear stress. The quality of the approximation depends on how closely the assumed profile matches the true velocity distribution.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form analytic expression for the relative error.",
