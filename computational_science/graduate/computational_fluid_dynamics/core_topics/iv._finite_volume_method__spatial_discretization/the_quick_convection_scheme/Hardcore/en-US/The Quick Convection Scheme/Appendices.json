            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and analysis of a modified Quadratic Upwind Interpolation for Convective Kinematics (QUICK) scheme at a boundary. The solution is structured in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of QUICK Interpolation Weights\n\nThe QUICK scheme constructs a quadratic interpolating polynomial, $\\phi(x)$, through three appropriately chosen points. For the face $f$ located at $x_{f} = \\Delta x$, which is between cell centers $P$ and $E$, with a strictly positive velocity $u > 0$, the upwind direction is from left to right. The problem specifies using the nodal values at the upwind cell $P$ ($x_{P} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta x$), the downstream cell $E$ ($x_{E} = \\frac{3}{2}\\Delta x$), and the Dirichlet boundary value at the inlet boundary $\\Gamma$ ($x_{\\Gamma} = 0$). The corresponding values of the scalar field are $\\phi_{P}$, $\\phi_{E}$, and $\\phi_{\\Gamma}$.\n\nLet the quadratic interpolant be of the form $\\phi(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. To simplify the algebra, we introduce a normalized coordinate $\\xi = x/\\Delta x$. The three interpolation points in this coordinate system are:\n- At the boundary $\\Gamma$: $\\xi_{\\Gamma} = 0$, with value $\\phi_{\\Gamma}$.\n- At the cell center $P$: $\\xi_{P} = \\frac{1}{2}$, with value $\\phi_{P}$.\n- At the cell center $E$: $\\xi_{E} = \\frac{3}{2}$, with value $\\phi_{E}$.\n\nThe interpolant is to be evaluated at the face $f$, which is at location $\\xi_{f} = 1$.\n\nWe can use Lagrange interpolation to find the value at $\\xi_{f} = 1$ directly. The interpolated value $\\phi_f$ is a linear combination of the nodal values:\n$$ \\phi_f = L_{\\Gamma}(\\xi_f)\\phi_{\\Gamma} + L_{P}(\\xi_f)\\phi_{P} + L_{E}(\\xi_f)\\phi_{E} $$\nThe coefficients $L_i(\\xi_f)$ are the interpolation weights $w_i$.\n\nThe Lagrange basis polynomials evaluated at $\\xi_f = 1$ are:\n- For the boundary point $\\Gamma$:\n$$ w_{\\Gamma} = L_{\\Gamma}(1) = \\frac{(1 - \\xi_{P})(1 - \\xi_{E})}{(\\xi_{\\Gamma} - \\xi_{P})(\\xi_{\\Gamma} - \\xi_{E})} = \\frac{(1 - \\frac{1}{2})(1 - \\frac{3}{2})}{(0 - \\frac{1}{2})(0 - \\frac{3}{2})} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{2})}{(-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{3}{2})} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\n- For the cell center $P$:\n$$ w_{P} = L_{P}(1) = \\frac{(1 - \\xi_{\\Gamma})(1 - \\xi_{E})}{(\\xi_{P} - \\xi_{\\Gamma})(\\xi_{P} - \\xi_{E})} = \\frac{(1 - 0)(1 - \\frac{3}{2})}{(\\frac{1}{2} - 0)(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{2})} = \\frac{(1)(-\\frac{1}{2})}{(\\frac{1}{2})(-1)} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = 1 $$\n- For the cell center $E$:\n$$ w_{E} = L_{E}(1) = \\frac{(1 - \\xi_{\\Gamma})(1 - \\xi_{P})}{(\\xi_{E} - \\xi_{\\Gamma})(\\xi_{E} - \\xi_{P})} = \\frac{(1 - 0)(1 - \\frac{1}{2})}{(\\frac{3}{2} - 0)(\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2})} = \\frac{(1)(\\frac{1}{2})}{(\\frac{3}{2})(1)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe resulting face value is:\n$$ \\phi_f = w_{\\Gamma}\\phi_{\\Gamma} + w_{P}\\phi_{P} + w_{E}\\phi_{E} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\phi_{\\Gamma} + 1\\cdot\\phi_{P} + \\frac{1}{3}\\phi_{E} $$\n\n### Part 2: Bounded Modified QUICK Face Value\n\nThe standard QUICK interpolation is not guaranteed to be bounded, meaning it can produce unphysical oscillations (overshoots or undershoots). This is due to the presence of negative interpolation weights. In our case, $w_{\\Gamma} = -1/3$.\n\nThe problem specifies a modification to enforce boundedness: set any negative weights to zero and renormalize the remaining weights to sum to $1$.\nThe original weights are $w_{\\Gamma} = -1/3$, $w_{P} = 1$, and $w_{E} = 1/3$.\nSetting the negative weight to zero gives the unnormalized modified weights:\n$$ w'_{\\Gamma, \\text{un}} = 0, \\quad w'_{P, \\text{un}} = w_{P} = 1, \\quad w'_{E, \\text{un}} = w_{E} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe sum of the remaining non-negative weights is $S = w_{P} + w_{E} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nWe renormalize by dividing by this sum:\n$$ w'_{\\Gamma} = 0 $$\n$$ w'_{P} = \\frac{w_{P}}{S} = \\frac{1}{4/3} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n$$ w'_{E} = \\frac{w_{E}}{S} = \\frac{1/3}{4/3} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThe modified face value, $\\phi_{f}^{\\text{mod}}$, is calculated using these new weights:\n$$ \\phi_{f}^{\\text{mod}} = w'_{\\Gamma}\\phi_{\\Gamma} + w'_{P}\\phi_{P} + w'_{E}\\phi_{E} = 0 \\cdot \\phi_{\\Gamma} + \\frac{3}{4}\\phi_{P} + \\frac{1}{4}\\phi_{E} $$\nAs requested, this expression for the modified face value is solely in terms of $\\phi_{P}$ and $\\phi_{E}$:\n$$ \\phi_{f}^{\\text{mod}} = \\frac{3}{4}\\phi_{P} + \\frac{1}{4}\\phi_{E} $$\n\n### Part 3: Analysis of Boundedness\n\nThe pure upwind scheme for $u > 0$ uses the value from the upwind cell center, $P$. Thus, the pure upwind face value is:\n$$ \\phi_{f}^{\\text{up}} = \\phi_{P} $$\nPure upwind is a first-order accurate scheme known for its robustness and for being unconditionally bounded (it never creates new extrema), although it introduces significant numerical diffusion.\n\nThe modified face value is $\\phi_{f}^{\\text{mod}} = \\frac{3}{4}\\phi_{P} + \\frac{1}{4}\\phi_{E}$. This is a weighted average of the values at the bounding cell centers, $\\phi_{P}$ and $\\phi_{E}$. The weights, $w'_{P} = 3/4$ and $w'_{E} = 1/4$, are both positive and sum to unity ($w'_{P} + w'_{E} = 1$). This means $\\phi_{f}^{\\text{mod}}$ is a convex combination of $\\phi_{P}$ and $\\phi_{E}$. A mathematical property of a convex combination is that its value is guaranteed to lie between the values being combined. That is:\n$$ \\min(\\phi_{P}, \\phi_{E}) \\le \\phi_{f}^{\\text{mod}} \\le \\max(\\phi_{P}, \\phi_{E}) $$\nThis demonstrates that the modified scheme is bounded at this face; it will not generate local overshoots or undershoots relative to its neighboring cell values. The modification procedure has successfully replaced the non-bounded quadratic interpolation with a bounded linear interpolation. This resulting scheme retains a higher order of accuracy than the first-order pure upwind scheme while ensuring boundedness, which the original QUICK scheme lacks.",

The $i$-th cell, $C_i$, spans the interval $[x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}]$, with its center at $x_i$. The cell-averaged value is $u_i(t) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} u(x,t) dx$.\n\nIntegrating the conservative form over cell $C_i$ yields:\n$$\n\\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} dx + \\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dx = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta x \\frac{d u_i}{d t} + f(x_{i+1/2}, t) - f(x_{i-1/2}, t) = 0\n$$\nDenoting the fluxes at the cell faces as $f_{i+1/2}$ and $f_{i-1/2}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_i}{d t} = - \\frac{f_{i+1/2} - f_{i-1/2}}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nApplying an explicit forward Euler scheme for time integration from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1} = t^n + \\Delta t$, we get the update formula for the cell average $u_i^n \\approx u_i(t^n)$:\n$$\n\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t} = - \\frac{f_{i+1/2}^n - f_{i-1/2}^n}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n$$\nu_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (f_{i+1/2}^n - f_{i-1/2}^n)\n$$\nSince $f = au$, the fluxes are $f_{i \\pm 1/2}^n = a u_{i \\pm 1/2}^n$, where $u_{i \\pm 1/2}^n$ is the value of the quantity $u$ at the cell face at time $t^n$. The core of the scheme is to determine this face value.\n\nThe Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics (QUICK) scheme approximates the face value by fitting a quadratic polynomial to three cell-centered values. The choice of these three points is biased towards the upstream direction of the flow.\n\nLet's derive the interpolation polynomial. For a uniform grid, we can fit a parabola $P(\\xi) = c_0 + c_1 \\xi + c_2 \\xi^2$ to three points. To find the value at face $i+1/2$, located at a physical coordinate midway between $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$, the standard QUICK scheme uses the cell-centered values $u_{i-1}$, $u_i$, and $u_{i+1}$. By setting a local coordinate system with its origin at $x_i$ (so $\\xi_i=0$, $\\xi_{i-1}=-\\Delta x$, $\\xi_{i+1}=\\Delta x$), the parabola passing through $(-\\Delta x, u_{i-1})$, $(0, u_i)$, and $(\\Delta x, u_{i+1})$ is:\n$$\nP(\\xi) = u_i + \\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2\\Delta x}\\xi + \\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_i+u_{i-1}}{2\\Delta x^2}\\xi^2\n$$\nThe \"upstream\" nature of QUICK dictates which three-point stencil is used to evaluate the value at a face, depending on the sign of the advection velocity $a$.\n\n**Case 1: Advection is to the right ($a  0$)**\nThe flow is from left to right.\n-   To find $u_{i+1/2}$, the value at the right face of cell $i$, we use the upstream-biased stencil of points centered around the face: $u_{i-1}$, $u_i$, $u_{i+1}$. The face is at $\\xi = \\Delta x / 2$. Evaluating the polynomial $P(\\xi)$ at this location gives:\n    $$\n    u_{i+1/2} = P(\\Delta x/2) = u_i + \\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{4} + \\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_i+u_{i-1}}{8} = \\frac{3}{8}u_{i+1} + \\frac{6}{8}u_i - \\frac{1}{8}u_{i-1}\n    $$\n-   To find $u_{i-1/2}$, the value at the left face of cell $i$, we shift the indices of the above formula by $-1$:\n    $$\n    u_{i-1/2} = \\frac{3}{8}u_{i} + \\frac{6}{8}u_{i-1} - \\frac{1}{8}u_{i-2}\n    $$\nThe flux difference across cell $i$ is $a(u_{i+1/2}^n - u_{i-1/2}^n)$.

The upstream direction is to the right.\n-   To find $u_{i+1/2}$, we use the upstream-biased stencil $\\{u_i, u_{i+1}, u_{i+2}\\}$. The interpolation formula, derived by fitting a parabola through these points and evaluating at the face, is:\n    $$\n    u_{i+1/2} = \\frac{3}{8}u_{i} + \\frac{6}{8}u_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{8}u_{i+2}\n    $$\n-   To find $u_{i-1/2}$, we shift the indices by $-1$:\n    $$\n    u_{i-1/2} = \\frac{3}{8}u_{i-1} + \\frac{6}{8}u_{i} - \\frac{1}{8}u_{i+1}\n    $$\nLet $\\nu = \\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{-a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$, so $\\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} = -\\nu$.

The domain is periodic, so stencil indices that go out of bounds $\\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$ are wrapped around. This is efficiently handled in `numpy` using `np.roll`.\n\nThe initial condition is a piecewise-constant function with a single jump at $x_0$, which lies on a cell face. For $N=64$ and $x_0=0.5$, the jump is between cell $i=31$ and $i=32$. The initial array $u^0$ is constructed accordingly.\n\nAfter computing the updated state $u^{n+1}$, the overshoot/undershoot ratio $R$ is calculated. The problem defines $R$ with a specific conditional logic:\n1.  If the new maximum $\\max\\{u_i^{n+1}\\}$ exceeds the initial maximum $\\max(u_L, u_R)$, the overshoot is computed and returned.\n2.  Otherwise, if the new minimum $\\min\\{u_i^{n+1}\\}$ is below the initial minimum $\\min(u_L, u_R)$, the undershoot is computed and returned.\n3.  Otherwise, the violation is zero.\n\nThis `if-elif-else` structure gives priority to reporting overshoots. If both overshoots and undershoots are present, only the value of $R$ corresponding to the overshoot is reported, regardless of the magnitude of the undershoot. This logic is followed precisely in the implementation.\n\nThe analytical forms of the overshoot/undershoot for a unit step profile with the QUICK scheme are well-known and depend on the Courant number $\\nu$. For a rising step ($u_L=1, u_R=0$) and $a0$, the scheme produces an overshoot of magnitude $3\\nu/8$ and an undershoot of magnitude $\\nu/8$. For a falling step ($u_L=0, u_R=1$) and $a0$, it produces an undershoot of $3\\nu/8$ and an overshoot of $\\nu/8$. The behavior for $a0$ is spatially mirrored. The provided code numerically computes these values for each test case.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a valid and well-posed exercise in computational fluid dynamics. It requires the numerical solution of the one-dimensional linear advection equation using a finite-volume method with the QUICK scheme, and a comparative analysis of three different strategies for handling the non-monotonic behavior inherent to the baseline QUICK scheme.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is the linear advection equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\phi(x,t)$ represents a scalar quantity being advected with a constant, positive velocity $u0$. The spatial domain is $x \\in [0,1)$ with periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe employ a finite-volume discretization. The domain is divided into $N_x$ cells, each of width $\\Delta x = 1/N_x$. The cell-averaged value of $\\phi$ in cell $i$ at time $t^n = n\\Delta t$ is denoted by $\\phi_i^n$. Integrating the PDE over cell $i$ from $x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}$ to $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$ yields the exact relation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi_i}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\left( u\\phi(x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}, t) - u\\phi(x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}, t) \\right) = 0\n$$\nAn explicit Euler time-stepping scheme gives the semi-discrete finite-volume update rule:\n$$\n\\phi_i^{n+1} = \\phi_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\Big(F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n - F_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}^n\\Big)\n$$\nwhere $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n = u\\,\\phi_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n$ is the numerical flux across the face at $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$. The time step is $\\Delta t = \\mathrm{CFL}\\,\\Delta x/u$, where $\\mathrm{CFL} \\in (0,1)$ is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number.\n\nThe initial condition is a periodic Gaussian profile centered at $x_0$:\n$$\n\\phi(x,0) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{d(x,x_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $d(x,x_0) = \\min_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} |x - x_0 + k|$ is the geodesic distance on the periodic domain. The initial cell-averaged values are initialized by sampling this function at the cell centers, $\\phi_i^0 = \\phi(x_i, 0)$ where $x_i = (i+\\frac{1}{2})\\Delta x$. The initial profile is bounded, with $\\phi(x,0) \\in (0, 1]$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the approximation of the face value $\\phi_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n$. The problem specifies the use of the Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics (QUICK) scheme. For $u0$, this scheme reconstructs the face value using a quadratic polynomial fitted to the two adjacent upwind cell averages ($\\phi_{i-1}^n$, $\\phi_i^n$) and the first downwind cell average ($\\phi_{i+1}^n$). The resulting formula is:\n$$\n\\phi_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\mathrm{QUICK},n} = -\\frac{1}{8}\\phi_{i-1}^n + \\frac{6}{8}\\phi_{i}^n + \\frac{3}{8}\\phi_{i+1}^n\n$$\nThis scheme is third-order accurate for uniform grids but is known to be non-monotonic, meaning it can produce unphysical oscillations (overshoots and undershoots) near steep gradients, violating the discrete maximum principle. The problem requires the implementation and comparison of three approaches to address this.\n\n**1. Baseline QUICK Scheme:**\nThis approach uses the $\\phi_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\mathrm{QUICK},n}$ values directly to compute the flux $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n = u\\,\\phi_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\mathrm{QUICK},n}$. The finite-volume update is conservative, meaning the total mass $\\sum_i \\phi_i^n$ is conserved up to machine precision. However, as noted, it is expected to produce overshoots ($\\phi_i^{n_t}  1$) and undershoots ($\\phi_i^{n_t}  0$). We quantify these with $\\epsilon_+^{\\mathrm{base}}$ and $\\epsilon_-^{\\mathrm{base}}$, and verify conservation with $\\Delta M^{\\mathrm{base}}$.\n\n**2. Face-Level Clipping (Flux Limiter):**\nThis strategy aims to enforce monotonicity while preserving conservation. It acts by \"clipping\" the reconstructed face value to lie within the bounds defined by the values in its local stencil. For each face $i+\\frac{1}{2}$, the local bounds are:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\min}^{(i+\\frac{1}{2}),n} = \\min\\{\\phi_{i-1}^n,\\phi_{i}^n,\\phi_{i+1}^n\\} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\phi_{\\max}^{(i+\\frac{1}{2}),n} = \\max\\{\\phi_{i-1}^n,\\phi_{i}^n,\\phi_{i+1}^n\\}\n$$\nThe QUICK face value is then clipped to these bounds:\n$$\n\\phi_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\mathrm{clip},n} = \\min\\Big(\\phi_{\\max}^{(i+\\frac{1}{2}),n},\\ \\max\\big(\\phi_{\\min}^{(i+\\frac{1}{2}),n},\\ \\phi_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\mathrm{QUICK},n}\\big)\\Big)\n$$\nThe numerical flux is computed using this clipped value: $F_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^n = u\\,\\phi_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\mathrm{clip},n}$. Because the same flux value is used as an outflow for cell $i$ and an inflow for cell $i+1$, the scheme remains fully conservative. This technique is a form of flux limiter. While it may not strictly enforce the global maximum principle (i.e., $\\phi_i^{n+1}$ may still slightly exceed the global maximum of $\\phi^n$), it significantly dampens oscillations and is expected to substantially reduce or eliminate $\\epsilon_+^{\\mathrm{face}}$ and $\\epsilon_-^{\\mathrm{face}}$ compared to the baseline, while keeping $\\Delta M^{\\mathrm{face}}$ near zero.\n\n**3. Post-Update Cell-Value Clipping:**\nThis is a more direct, but non-conservative, method. The finite-volume update is first performed using the baseline QUICK scheme. Then, the resulting cell values $\\phi_i^{n+1}$ are forcibly clipped to the known physical bounds of the initial solution, $[0,1]$:\n$$\n\\phi_i^{n+1} \\leftarrow \\min\\{1, \\max\\{0, \\phi_i^{n+1}\\}\\}\n$$\nBy definition, this method will result in $\\epsilon_+^{\\mathrm{post}}=0$ and $\\epsilon_-^{\\mathrm{post}}=0$. However, this clipping is applied independently to each cell after the flux-balancing step. It does not respect the conservation law that the finite-volume method is built upon. As a result, this method artificially adds or removes mass from the system, and the conservation error $\\Delta M^{\\mathrm{post}}$ is expected to be significant.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by simulating the advection for approximately one flow-through time for each of the three specified test cases. For each case and each of the three strategies, we will compute the final overshoot, undershoot, and change in total mass as defined in the problem statement. This comparative analysis will highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, monotonicity, and conservation in numerical schemes for advection.",
