It presents a standard derivation in the a priori error analysis of the Finite Element Method, a cornerstone of computational mechanics and engineering. The concepts of affine mappings between reference and physical elements, Sobolev spaces ($H^{1}$), and shape-regularity conditions are fundamental to the theory.\nThe problem is well-posed. It asks for a specific scaling factor based on a clear set of definitions and assumptions. All information required for the derivation is provided, and there are no internal contradictions. The language is objective and mathematically precise.\nThe problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is formal, relevant, complete, realistic, and non-trivial.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to establish the relationship between the $H^{1}$ seminorm of a function $v$ on the physical element $K$ and the $H^{1}$ seminorm of its corresponding function $\\hat v$ on the reference element $\\hat K$. We begin with the definition of the squared seminorm of $v$:\n$$\n|v|_{H^{1}(K)}^{2} = \\int_{K} |\\nabla_{x} v(x)|^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nHere, $\\nabla_{x}$ denotes the gradient with respect to the variable $x \\in K$. The function $v$ is defined as $v(x) = \\hat v(\\hat x)$, where $\\hat x = F_{K}^{-1}(x)$. To relate $\\nabla_{x} v$ to $\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v$, we employ the chain rule. The inverse mapping is given by $\\hat x = F_{K}^{-1}(x) = A_{K}^{-1}(x - b_{K})$. The Jacobian matrix of this inverse transformation is $J_{F_{K}^{-1}} = A_{K}^{-1}$.\n\nApplying the chain rule for vector-valued functions, the gradient of $v(x) = \\hat v(F_{K}^{-1}(x))$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{x} v(x) = (J_{F_{K}^{-1}})^{T} \\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x) = (A_{K}^{-1})^{T} \\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v$ is the gradient of $\\hat v$ with respect to $\\hat x$.\n\nNow, we consider the squared Euclidean norm of this gradient vector:\n$$\n|\\nabla_{x} v(x)|^{2} = \\left| (A_{K}^{-1})^{T} \\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x) \\right|^{2}\n$$\nThe squared norm of a vector transformed by a matrix is bounded by the operator norm of that matrix. Specifically, we have the inequality:\n$$\n|\\nabla_{x} v(x)|^{2} \\le \\|(A_{K}^{-1})^{T}\\|^{2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2}\n$$\nSince the operator norm of a matrix is equal to the norm of its transpose, $\\|(A_{K}^{-1})^{T}\\| = \\|A_{K}^{-1}\\|$, this becomes:\n$$\n|\\nabla_{x} v(x)|^{2} \\le \\|A_{K}^{-1}\\|^{2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2}\n$$\nFor a lower bound, we use the property that for an invertible matrix $M$ and any vector $u$, $|Mu| \\ge \\|M^{-1}\\|^{-1}|u|$. Applying this to the matrix $(A_{K}^{-1})^{T}$ and the vector $\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)$:\n$$\n|\\nabla_{x} v(x)|^{2} = \\left| (A_{K}^{-1})^{T} \\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x) \\right|^{2} \\ge \\left( \\| ((A_{K}^{-1})^{T})^{-1} \\|^{-1} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)| \\right)^{2} = \\|(A_{K}^{T})^{-1}\\|^{-2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2}\n$$\nUsing the properties $\\|M^{-1}\\|^{-1} = \\sigma_{\\min}(M)$ (the smallest singular value of $M$) and $\\|M\\| = \\|M^T\\|$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n|\\nabla_{x} v(x)|^{2} \\ge \\|A_{K}^{T}\\|^{-2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2} = \\|A_{K}\\|^{-2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2}\n$$\nCombining these inequalities, we have bounded the squared norm of the gradient:\n$$\n\\|A_{K}\\|^{-2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2} \\le |\\nabla_{x} v(x)|^{2} \\le \\|A_{K}^{-1}\\|^{2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2}\n$$\nNext, we perform a change of variables in the integral defining $|v|_{H^{1}(K)}^{2}$. We substitute $x = F_{K}(\\hat x)$, which implies the differential volume element transforms as $dx = |\\det(J_{F_{K}})| \\,d\\hat x = |\\det(A_{K})| \\,d\\hat x$. The domain of integration changes from $K$ to $\\hat K$.\n$$\n|v|_{H^{1}(K)}^{2} = \\int_{\\hat K} |\\nabla_{x} v(F_{K}(\\hat x))|^{2} |\\det(A_{K})| \\, d\\hat x\n$$\nSubstituting our bounds for $|\\nabla_{x} v(x)|^{2}$ into this integral expression, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_{\\hat K} \\|A_{K}\\|^{-2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2} |\\det(A_{K})| \\, d\\hat x \\le |v|_{H^{1}(K)}^{2} \\le \\int_{\\hat K} \\|A_{K}^{-1}\\|^{2} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2} |\\det(A_{K})| \\, d\\hat x\n$$\nThe terms involving $A_{K}$ are constant with respect to the integration variable $\\hat x$, so they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\n\\|A_{K}\\|^{-2} |\\det(A_{K})| \\int_{\\hat K} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2} \\, d\\hat x \\le |v|_{H^{1}(K)}^{2} \\le \\|A_{K}^{-1}\\|^{2} |\\det(A_{K})| \\int_{\\hat K} |\\nabla_{\\hat x} \\hat v(\\hat x)|^{2} \\, d\\hat x\n$$\nThe integral is precisely the definition of the squared seminorm of $\\hat v$ on the reference element, $|\\hat v|_{H^{1}(\\hat K)}^{2}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\|A_{K}\\|^{-2} |\\det(A_{K})| |\\hat v|_{H^{1}(\\hat K)}^{2} \\le |v|_{H^{1}(K)}^{2} \\le \\|A_{K}^{-1}\\|^{2} |\\det(A_{K})| |\\hat v|_{H^{1}(\\hat K)}^{2}\n$$\nNow we apply the given shape-regularity bounds to determine the dependence on $h_{K}$.\nFor the upper bound:\n-   $\\|A_{K}^{-1}\\| \\le c_{4} h_{K}^{-1} \\implies \\|A_{K}^{-1}\\|^{2} \\le c_{4}^{2} h_{K}^{-2}$\n-   $|\\det(A_{K})| \\le c_{6} h_{K}^{d}$\nThe product is $\\|A_{K}^{-1}\\|^{2} |\\det(A_{K})| \\le (c_{4}^{2} h_{K}^{-2})(c_{6} h_{K}^{d}) = c_{4}^{2}c_{6} h_{K}^{d-2}$.\n\nFor the lower bound:\n-   $\\|A_{K}\\| \\le c_{2} h_{K} \\implies \\|A_{K}\\|^{-2} \\ge (c_{2} h_{K})^{-2} = c_{2}^{-2} h_{K}^{-2}$\n-   $|\\det(A_{K})| \\ge c_{5} h_{K}^{d}$\nThe product is $\\|A_{K}\\|^{-2} |\\det(A_{K})| \\ge (c_{2}^{-2} h_{K}^{-2})(c_{5} h_{K}^{d}) = c_{2}^{-2}c_{5} h_{K}^{d-2}$.\n\nLet $C_{L} = c_{2}^{-2}c_{5}$ and $C_{U} = c_{4}^{2}c_{6}$. These are positive constants independent of $K$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\nC_{L} h_{K}^{d-2} |\\hat v|_{H^{1}(\\hat K)}^{2} \\le |v|_{H^{1}(K)}^{2} \\le C_{U} h_{K}^{d-2} |\\hat v|_{H^{1}(\\hat K)}^{2}\n$$\nTaking the square root of all parts yields:\n$$\n\\sqrt{C_{L}} (h_{K}^{d-2})^{1/2} |\\hat v|_{H^{1}(\\hat K)} \\le |v|_{H^{1}(K)} \\le \\sqrt{C_{U}} (h_{K}^{d-2})^{1/2} |\\hat v|_{H^{1}(\\hat K)}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $|v|_{H^{1}(K)}$ is proportional to $h_{K}^{\\frac{d-2}{2}} |\\hat v|_{H^{1}(\\hat K)}$, with proportionality constants that are independent of $h_{K}$ and $\\hat v$.\nThe problem asks for the scaling factor $S(h_{K},d)$ that captures this dependence on $h_{K}$ and $d$.

            "introduction": "Standard a priori error estimates typically hide geometric dependencies within a generic constant $C$, which is assumed to be independent of the mesh size $h$. This assumption, however, hinges on the mesh being \"shape regular,\" meaning its elements are not excessively stretched or flattened.

Let $V_{h}$ denote the conforming continuous piecewise linear Finite Element Method (FEM) space over a family of triangulations $\\{\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}\\}_{\\epsilon>0}$ of $\\Omega$.

Let $u_{h} \\in V_{h}$ be the Galerkin solution.\n\nThe classical $H^{1}$ a priori error bound for such problems asserts the existence of a constant $C>0$ such that\n$$\n\\|u - u_{h}\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} \\leq C\\, h^{s}\\, \\|u\\|_{H^{1+s}(\\Omega)},\n$$\nfor some $s \\in (0,1]$ depending on regularity, where $h := \\max_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}} h_{K}$ and $h_{K} := \\operatorname{diam}(K)$ denotes the element diameter. In standard theory, $C$ is independent of $h$ under uniform shape regularity. In this problem, you will construct a counterexample to mesh-independent $C$ by quantifying the effect of loss of shape regularity through a geometric mesh-distortion measure.\n\nStarting from fundamental principles, namely affine mapping of elements and the Poincaré inequality on star-shaped domains, rigorously argue which geometric measure of mesh distortion the constant $C$ must depend on when shape regularity is lost.

            "solution": "The problem requires, first, a rigorous argument identifying the geometric measure of mesh distortion that the constant $C$ in the a priori error estimate depends on, and second, the computation of this measure for a given family of degenerating triangulations.\n\nWe begin with the theoretical argument. The standard a priori error estimate for the conforming finite element method begins with Céa's lemma, which for the given problem states that the error in the Galerkin solution $u_h$ is bounded by the best approximation error in the finite element space $V_h$:\n$$\n\\|u - u_h\\|_{H^1(\\Omega)} \\leq C_{Cea} \\inf_{v_h \\in V_h} \\|u - v_h\\|_{H^1(\\Omega)}\n$$\nThe constant $C_{Cea}$ depends only on the coercivity and continuity constants of the bilinear form associated with the PDE, not on the mesh geometry. The problem is thus reduced to analyzing the interpolation error, as the infimum is bounded by the error of a specific interpolant, $\\Pi_h u \\in V_h$:\n$$\n\\inf_{v_h \\in V_h} \\|u - v_h\\|_{H^1(\\Omega)} \\leq \\|u - \\Pi_h u\\|_{H^1(\\Omega)}\n$$\nThe global interpolation error is analyzed by summing local contributions from each element $K$ in the triangulation $\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}$:\n$$\n\\|u - \\Pi_h u\\|_{H^1(\\Omega)}^2 = \\sum_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}} \\|u - \\Pi_h u\\|_{H^1(K)}^2\n$$\nThe local interpolation error on an element $K$ is estimated using an affine mapping $F_K: \\hat{K} \\to K$, defined by $x = F_K(\\hat{x}) = B_K \\hat{x} + b_K$, which maps a fixed reference element $\\hat{K}$ (e.g., the unit right triangle) to the physical element $K$. The matrix $B_K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ is the Jacobian of the transformation.\nBy applying the Bramble-Hilbert lemma on the reference element and using scaling arguments to transform Sobolev norms between $\\hat{K}$ and $K$, one can derive the local interpolation error bound. The scaling arguments show that for a function $v \\in H^2(K)$ and its counterpart $\\hat{v} = v \\circ F_K$ on $\\hat{K}$, the seminorms are related by:\n$$\n|v|_{H^m(K)} \\le C |\\det(B_K)|^{-1/2} \\|B_K\\|^m |\\hat{v}|_{H^m(\\hat{K})}\n$$\nand\n$$\n|\\hat{v}|_{H^m(\\hat{K})} \\le C |\\det(B_K)|^{1/2} \\|B_K^{-1}\\|^m |v|_{H^m(K)}\n$$\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|$ denotes a matrix norm. Combining these transformations for the interpolation error $|u-\\Pi_h u|_{H^1(K)}$ (which involves derivatives of order $m=1$) bounded by the seminorm $|u|_{H^2(K)}$ (derivatives of order $m=2$) leads to an estimate where the constant depends on the geometric properties of the mapping, encapsulated by the matrix $B_K$. The resulting local estimate is of the form:\n$$\n|u - \\Pi_h u|_{H^1(K)} \\le C_{int} \\|B_K\\| \\|B_K^{-1}\\| |u|_{H^2(K)}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\|B_K\\| \\|B_K^{-1}\\|$ is the condition number of the Jacobian matrix $B_K$. It is a fundamental result in the analysis of finite elements that this condition number is equivalent to the ratio of the element diameter $h_K$ to its inradius $\\rho_K$. Specifically, there exist constants $c_1, c_2$ that depend only on the dimension (here, $2$) and the reference element $\\hat{K}$, such that:\n$$\nc_1 \\frac{h_K}{\\rho_K} \\leq \\|B_K\\| \\|B_K^{-1}\\| \\leq c_2 \\frac{h_K}{\\rho_K}\n$$\nThis establishes that the ratio $h_K/\\rho_K$ is the critical geometric measure of mesh distortion. Summing the local error estimates over all elements, the global constant $C$ in the final a priori error bound $\\|u - u_h\\|_{H^1(\\Omega)} \\leq C h |u|_{H^2(\\Omega)}$ will depend on $\\max_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_\\epsilon} (h_K/\\rho_K)$. Thus, the mesh distortion parameter is precisely $\\gamma(\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}) = \\sup_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}} \\frac{h_K}{\\rho_K}$.\n\nNext, we compute this parameter for the given family of triangulations. The mesh $\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}$ contains one potentially degenerate triangle $K_{\\epsilon}$ and a set of other triangles that are uniformly shape regular, meaning their $h_K/\\rho_K$ ratio is bounded by a constant independent of $\\epsilon$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the triangle $K_{\\epsilon}$ becomes increasingly \"flat\" or \"thin,\" and its $h_{K_{\\epsilon}}/\\rho_{K_{\\epsilon}}$ ratio will grow without bound. For any sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, this ratio will exceed the constant bound for the other triangles. Therefore, the supremum is determined by $K_{\\epsilon}$:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{h_{K_{\\epsilon}}}{\\rho_{K_{\\epsilon}}}\n$$\nThe vertices of triangle $K_{\\epsilon}$ are $A=(0,0)$, $B=(1,0)$, and $C=(0,\\epsilon)$. We calculate the lengths of its sides:\n- Side $c = |AB| = \\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = 1$\n- Side $b = |AC| = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (\\epsilon-0)^2} = \\epsilon$\n- Side $a = |BC| = \\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (0-\\epsilon)^2} = \\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2}$\n\nThe diameter of the triangle, $h_{K_{\\epsilon}}$, is the length of its longest side. Since $\\epsilon > 0$, we have $1+\\epsilon^2 > 1$ and $1+\\epsilon^2 > \\epsilon^2$. Taking the square root, we find $\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2} > 1$ and $\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2} > \\epsilon$. Thus, the longest side is $BC$.\n$$\nh_{K_{\\epsilon}} = \\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2}\n$$\nThe inradius $\\rho_K$ is given by the formula $\\rho_K = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{Area}(K)}{\\text{Perimeter}(K)}$.

Its area is:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(K_{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\epsilon = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\n$$\nFor a right-angled triangle with legs $p$, $q$ and hypotenuse $r$, a convenient formula for the inradius is $\\rho = (p+q-r)/2$.

So, the inradius is:\n$$\n\\rho_{K_{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{1 + \\epsilon - \\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2}}{2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio which defines the mesh distortion parameter:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\mathcal{T}_{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{h_{K_{\\epsilon}}}{\\rho_{K_{\\epsilon}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2}}{\\frac{1 + \\epsilon - \\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2}}{2}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2}}{1 + \\epsilon - \\sqrt{1+\\epsilon^2}}\n$$\nThis expression quantifies the degradation of the mesh quality as $\\epsilon$ varies.",

Using this property, we can write for any $p \\in \\mathcal{P}_{k}$:\n$$\nu - \\Pi_{h}u = (u - p) - \\Pi_{h}(u - p).\n$$\nApplying the triangle inequality to the $L^{2}(K)$-norm yields:\n$$\n\\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(K)} \\leq \\|u - p\\|_{L^{2}(K)} + \\|\\Pi_{h}(u - p)\\|_{L^{2}(K)}.\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\Pi_h$ is a local, $H^{m}$-stable operator. For the $L^2$ estimate, we assume stability in the $L^2$-norm (i.e., $m=0$). The locality of the operator means that the value of $\\Pi_h v$ on an element $K$ depends only on the values of $v$ in a small patch of neighboring elements, which we denote $\\omega_K$. The stability property then implies there exists a constant $C_{stab}$, independent of $h$ and $v$, such that:\n$$\n\\|\\Pi_{h}v\\|_{L^{2}(K)} \\leq C_{stab} \\|v\\|_{L^{2}(\\omega_K)}.\n$$\nApplying this to the term $\\|\\Pi_{h}(u-p)\\|_{L^2(K)}$ gives:\n$$\n\\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(K)} \\leq \\|u - p\\|_{L^{2}(K)} + C_{stab} \\|u - p\\|_{L^{2}(\\omega_K)}.\n$$\nSince $K \\subset \\omega_K$, we can combine these terms:\n$$\n\\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(K)} \\leq (1+C_{stab}) \\|u - p\\|_{L^{2}(\\omega_K)}.\n$$\nThis inequality holds for any polynomial $p \\in \\mathcal{P}_{k}$. We can therefore choose the polynomial that minimizes the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(K)} \\leq (1+C_{stab}) \\inf_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}_{k}} \\|u - p\\|_{L^{2}(\\omega_K)}.\n$$\nThe Bramble–Hilbert lemma, combined with a scaling argument from a reference element, provides an estimate for this polynomial approximation error. For a domain such as $\\omega_K$ and for a function $v \\in H^{t}(\\omega_K)$, the following standard approximation result holds for $0 \\leq j \\leq t$ and $t \\leq k+1$:\n$$\n\\inf_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}_{k}} \\|v-p\\|_{H^{j}(\\omega_K)} \\leq C (\\text{diam}(\\omega_K))^{t-j} |v|_{H^{t}(\\omega_K)}.\n$$\nSince the mesh is quasi-uniform, the diameter of the patch $\\omega_K$ is proportional to the meshsize $h$, i.e., $\\text{diam}(\\omega_K) \\le C'h$. Setting $j=0$ and applying this to our function $u$, assuming $u \\in H^t(\\omega_K)$, we get:\n$$\n\\inf_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}_{k}} \\|u - p\\|_{L^{2}(\\omega_K)} \\leq C h^{t} |u|_{H^{t}(\\omega_K)}.\n$$\nThis holds for any $t$ such that $0 < t \\leq k+1$. For the term $|u|_{H^{t}(\\omega_K)}$ to be meaningful, we also require that the global function $u$ has at least this much regularity, i.e., $u \\in H^s(\\Omega)$ and $t \\le s$. Combining these constraints, the estimate is valid for $0 < t \\leq \\min\\{k+1, s\\}$. Substituting this into our local error bound:\n$$\n\\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(K)}^{2} \\leq C_{loc}^2 h^{2t} |u|_{H^{t}(\\omega_K)}^{2} = C_{loc}^2 h^{2t} \\sum_{K' \\subset \\omega_K} |u|_{H^{t}(K')}^{2}.\n$$\nWe sum over all elements $K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}$ to obtain the global error:\n$$\n\\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\sum_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}} \\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(K)}^{2} \\leq C h^{2t} \\sum_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}} \\sum_{K' \\subset \\omega_K} |u|_{H^{t}(K')}^{2}.\n$$\nThe assumption that the mesh family is shape-regular and quasi-uniform implies there is a finite overlap number. We can thus reorder the summation:\n$$\n\\sum_{K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}} \\sum_{K' \\subset \\omega_K} |u|_{H^{t}(K')}^{2} \\leq C_{overlap} \\sum_{K' \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}} |u|_{H^{t}(K')}^{2} = C_{overlap} |u|_{H^{t}(\\Omega)}^{2}.\n$$\nThis leads to the global estimate $\\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} \\leq C' h^{2t} |u|_{H^{t}(\\Omega)}^{2}$. Taking the square root gives the desired result:\n$$\n\\|u - \\Pi_{h}u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\leq C h^{t} |u|_{H^{t}(\\Omega)},\n$$\nvalid for $0 < t \\leq \\min\\{k+1,s\\}$. This implies the convergence rate is $O(h^{\\min\\{k+1,s\\}})$.\n\nFor the second part, we analyze the singular function $u_{\\lambda}(r,\\theta) = r^{\\lambda}\\sin(\\lambda \\theta)$ with $\\lambda = \\pi/\\omega$. A function belongs to $H^{s}(\\Omega)$ if its weak derivatives up to order $s$ are in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$. The singularity is at the origin ($r=0$). A generic partial derivative of $u_{\\lambda}$ of integer order $m$ behaves like $r^{\\lambda-m}$ near the origin. We check the square-integrability of a term $g(r,\\theta) \\sim r^{\\beta}$ near $r=0$. In polar coordinates, the $L^2$ norm squared involves the integral $\\int_0^{\\epsilon} |r^{\\beta}|^2 r \\, dr$. This converges if and only if $2\\beta+1 > -1$, which simplifies to $\\beta > -1$.\nFor a partial derivative of order $m$, its radial behavior is $r^{\\lambda-m}$. For this to be in $L^2(\\Omega_{\\omega})$, we must have $\\lambda-m > -1$, which implies $m < \\lambda+1$. This means that $u_{\\lambda} \\in H^{m}(\\Omega_{\\omega})$ for all integers $m < \\lambda+1$, and by interpolation, $u_{\\lambda} \\in H^{s}(\\Omega_{\\omega})$ for all real numbers $s < \\lambda+1$. Conversely, a derivative of order $m \\ge \\lambda+1$ will have a radial component $r^\\beta$ with $\\beta \\le -1$, whose integral diverges. Thus, $u_{\\lambda} \\notin H^{s}(\\Omega_{\\omega})$ for any $s \\ge \\lambda+1$. The limiting Sobolev regularity is $s_{lim} = \\lambda+1$. The convergence rate from part 1, $O(h^{\\min\\{k+1,s\\}})$, is therefore limited by $O(h^{\\min\\{k+1, \\lambda+1-\\epsilon'\\}})$ for any $\\epsilon'>0$, commonly stated as $O(h^{\\min\\{k+1, \\lambda+1\\}})$. This rate is known to be sharp for quasi-uniform meshes due to pollution from the corner singularity.\n\nFor the third part, we are given the angle $\\omega = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ and quadratic elements, which corresponds to polynomial degree $k=2$. We compute the singularity exponent $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\pi/2} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n$$\nFrom part 2, the limiting Sobolev regularity index that can be used in the error estimate is any $s  \\lambda+1$. The optimal choice for $t$ in the estimate from Part 1 is the supremum of allowed values, which is $\\lambda+1$. Let's call this the effective regularity $s_{eff} = \\lambda+1$:\n$$\ns_{eff} = \\frac{2}{3} + 1 = \\frac{5}{3}.\n$$\nFrom part 1, the exponent of convergence in the $L^2$-norm is $\\min\\{k+1, s_{eff}\\}$. With $k=2$, the maximum possible exponent is $k+1 = 3$. We compare this with the regularity-limited exponent:\n$$\n\\text{exponent} = \\min\\left\\{3, \\frac{5}{3}\\right\\}.\n$$\nSince $3 = \\frac{9}{3}$, we have $\\min\\{\\frac{9}{3}, \\frac{5}{3}\\} = \\frac{5}{3}$. The convergence-rate exponent is $\\frac{5}{3}$.",
