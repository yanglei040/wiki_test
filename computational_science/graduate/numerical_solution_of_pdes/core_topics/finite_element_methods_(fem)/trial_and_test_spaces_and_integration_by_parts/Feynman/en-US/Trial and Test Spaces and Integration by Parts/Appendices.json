            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the weak formulation and the discrete system for a given boundary value problem, and then to determine the number of nonzero diagonals in the resulting finite element matrix as a function of the polynomial degree $p$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Weak Formulation**\n\nWe start with the strong form of the boundary value problem:\nFind $u: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n$$\n- \\big(a(x)\\,u'(x)\\big)' + c(x)\\,u(x) = f(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,1),\n$$\nwith homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$.\n\nThe principle of weighted residuals requires that the residual of the differential equation, $r(x) = f(x) + (a(x)u'(x))' - c(x)u(x)$, is orthogonal to a suitable space of test functions. The appropriate function space for both the solution $u$ and the test functions $v$, incorporating the homogeneous boundary conditions, is the Sobolev space $H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$. This space consists of functions in $L^2(0,1)$ whose weak derivatives are also in $L^2(0,1)$, and which satisfy the boundary conditions $u(0)=u(1)=0$ in the sense of traces.\n\nWe multiply the differential equation by an arbitrary test function $v \\in H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$ and integrate over the domain $\\Omega = (0,1)$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\left( - \\big(a(x)\\,u'(x)\\big)' + c(x)\\,u(x) \\right) v(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) v(x) \\, dx.\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts to the term involving the second derivative. For any functions $u \\in H^2(0,1)$ and $v \\in H^1(0,1)$, integration by parts states:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} - \\big(a(x)\\,u'(x)\\big)' v(x) \\, dx = - \\Big[ a(x)\\,u'(x)\\,v(x) \\Big]_{0}^{1} + \\int_{0}^{1} a(x)\\,u'(x)\\,v'(x) \\, dx.\n$$\nSince the test function $v$ is in $H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$, it satisfies $v(0)=0$ and $v(1)=0$. Therefore, the boundary term vanishes:\n$$\n- \\Big[ a(x)\\,u'(x)\\,v(x) \\Big]_{0}^{1} = - \\big( a(1)\\,u'(1)\\,v(1) - a(0)\\,u'(0)\\,v(0) \\big) = 0.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the integrated equation gives:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} a(x)\\,u'(x)\\,v'(x) \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} c(x)\\,u(x)\\,v(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) v(x) \\, dx.\n$$\nThis equation must hold for all $v \\in H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$. This is the weak formulation of the problem.\n\nWe can express this in the standard form: Find $u \\in H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$ such that\n$$\na(u,v) = \\ell(v) \\quad \\forall v \\in H_{0}^{1}(0,1),\n$$\nwhere $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a bilinear form and $\\ell(\\cdot)$ is a linear functional. By comparing with the derived equation, we identify:\nThe bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot): H_{0}^{1}(0,1) \\times H_{0}^{1}(0,1) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is given by:\n$$\na(u,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\big( a(x)\\,u'(x)\\,v'(x) + c(x)\\,u(x)\\,v(x) \\big) \\, dx.\n$$\nThe linear functional $\\ell(\\cdot): H_{0}^{1}(0,1) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\ell(v) = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)\\,v(x) \\, dx.\n$$\nThe conditions on $a(x)$, $c(x)$, and $f(x)$ ensure that these integrals are well-defined and that the bilinear form is continuous and coercive, guaranteeing a unique solution by the Lax-Milgram theorem.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Discrete Linear System**\n\nIn the Finite Element Method (FEM), we seek an approximate solution $u_h$ in a finite-dimensional subspace $V_h \\subset H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$. The problem states that $V_h$ is the space of continuous, piecewise polynomials of degree $p \\ge 1$ on a uniform mesh $\\mathcal{T}_h$. Let $\\{\\phi_j\\}_{j=1}^{n}$ be a nodal basis for $V_h$. The approximate solution can be written as a linear combination of these basis functions:\n$$\nu_h(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \\phi_j(x),\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)^T$ is the vector of unknown coefficients, which correspond to the values of $u_h$ at the internal nodes of the mesh.\n\nThe Galerkin method sets the trial space equal to the test space, $W_h=V_h$. The discrete problem is to find $u_h \\in V_h$ such that $a(u_h, v_h) = \\ell(v_h)$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$. Since $V_h$ is spanned by the basis functions $\\{\\psi_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ (which are the same as $\\{\\phi_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$), it is sufficient to enforce this condition for each basis function:\n$$\na(u_h, \\psi_i) = \\ell(\\psi_i) \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, n.\n$$\nSubstituting the expansion for $u_h$ and using the linearity of $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ in its first argument, we get:\n$$\na\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \\phi_j, \\psi_i\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j a(\\phi_j, \\psi_i) = \\ell(\\psi_i) \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, n.\n$$\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknowns $x_j$. We can write it in matrix form as $A\\boldsymbol{x} = \\boldsymbol{b}$, where the entries of the matrix $A$ (stiffness matrix) and the vector $\\boldsymbol{b}$ (load vector) are given by:\n$$\nA_{ij} = a(\\phi_j, \\psi_i) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\big( a(x)\\,\\phi_j'(x)\\,\\psi_i'(x) + c(x)\\,\\phi_j(x)\\,\\psi_i(x) \\big) \\, dx,\n$$\n$$\nb_i = \\ell(\\psi_i) = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)\\,\\psi_i(x) \\, dx.\n$$\nThe global matrix $A$ and vector $\\boldsymbol{b}$ are assembled from local contributions from each element $K_e$ in the mesh $\\mathcal{T}_h$. For each element $K_e$, one computes an element matrix $A^e$ and element vector $\\boldsymbol{b}^e$ using integrals restricted to $K_e$ and local basis functions. For example, $(A^e)_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\int_{K_e} (\\dots) dx$. The entries of these local matrices/vectors are then added to the corresponding positions in the global matrix/vector according to the global indices of the nodes belonging to element $K_e$.\n\n**Part 3: Number of Nonzero Diagonals**\n\nThe number of nonzero diagonals in the global matrix $A$ is determined by its sparsity pattern. The entry $A_{ij}$ is nonzero if and only if the supports of the basis functions $\\phi_j$ and $\\psi_i(=\\phi_i)$ have a non-empty intersection, because the integrand $a(x)\\phi_j'\\phi_i' + c(x)\\phi_j\\phi_i$ is then not identically zero on the intersection. The integral $A_{ij}$ is a sum of integrals over elements: $A_{ij} = \\sum_e \\int_{K_e} (\\dots)dx$. The summand $\\int_{K_e} (\\dots)dx$ is non-zero if and only if both $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are non-zero on the element $K_e$. This is equivalent to saying that the nodes associated with global indices $i$ and $j$ both belong to the set of nodes for element $K_e$. Thus, $A_{ij} \\neq 0$ if and only if there exists an element $K_e$ that contains both node $i$ and node $j$.\n\nThe number of nonzero diagonals is $2w+1$, where $w$ is the semi-bandwidth of the matrix, defined as $w = \\max_{i,j: A_{ij}\\neq 0} |i-j|$. We need to find this maximum index difference.\n\nThe problem states that the nodal basis functions $\\{\\phi_j\\}_{j=1}^{n}$ are ordered by increasing coordinate. Let the mesh vertices be $x_k = k/N$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, N$. The domain is $\\Omega=(0,1)$ with $u(0)=u(1)=0$, so the nodes at $x_0=0$ and $x_N=1$ are not associated with any degrees of freedom.\n\nFor a polynomial degree $p$, each element $K_e = [x_{e-1}, x_e]$ contains $p-1$ nodes in its interior and $2$ nodes at its vertices. The degrees of freedom are associated with the $N-1$ interior mesh vertices $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_{N-1}\\}$ and the $N \\times (p-1)$ element-interior nodes.\n\nLet's establish a global node indexing scheme that follows the specified ordering.\nFor each element \"cell\" consisting of the interior nodes of $K_e$ and its right vertex $x_e$, we have $p-1+1=p$ nodes.\n- For $e=1, \\dots, N-1$, the nodes are: $(p-1)$ interior to $K_e$, followed by vertex $x_e$.\n- For $e=N$, the nodes are just the $(p-1)$ interior nodes of $K_N$.\nThe nodes, ordered by coordinate, are:\n- $p-1$ interior nodes of $K_1$.\n- vertex $x_1$.\n- $p-1$ interior nodes of $K_2$.\n- vertex $x_2$.\n- ...\n- vertex $x_{N-1}$.\n- $p-1$ interior nodes of $K_N$.\n\nLet's assign indices $j=1, \\dots, n$ to these nodes. An element $K_e=[x_{e-1}, x_e]$ for $1eN$ is associated with the following nodes: vertex $x_{e-1}$, the $p-1$ interior nodes of $K_e$, and vertex $x_e$. This gives $1+(p-1)+1 = p+1$ nodes in total for one element.\nFollowing the natural ordering, the group of nodes from vertex $x_{e-1}$ to vertex $x_e$ consists of vertex $x_{e-1}$, the $p-1$ nodes inside $K_e$, and vertex $x_e$.\nThe index of vertex $x_{e-1}$ is $j=(e-1)p$. (This holds for $e1$).\nThe indices of the $p-1$ nodes inside $K_e$ are $(e-1)p+1, \\dots, (e-1)p+p-1$.\nThe index of vertex $x_e$ is $j=ep$.\nSo, for an interior element $K_e$ ($1eN$), the set of global indices of its associated nodes is $\\{ (e-1)p, (e-1)p+1, \\dots, ep \\}$. These are $p+1$ consecutive indices.\nThe maximum difference between any two indices in this set is $ep - ((e-1)p) = p$.\n\nFor any two nodes $i, j$ in this set, $A_{ij} \\neq 0$. This implies that a non-zero element $A_{i,j}$ exists where $|i-j|=p$. Specifically, for $i=(e-1)p$ and $j=ep$, the entry $A_{i,j}$ is non-zero. This establishes that the semi-bandwidth $w$ is at least $p$.\n\nNow, consider any two nodes $i$ and $j$ with $|i-j|  p$. These two nodes cannot belong to the same element, because the maximum index span within any single element is $p$. For example, if node $i$ is in element $K_e$, its index is at most $ep$. A node $j$ with index $j  ep+p$ cannot be in $K_e$ or $K_{e+1}$. Their basis functions do not share a common element, so their supports do not overlap, and $A_{ij}=0$. Therefore, the semi-bandwidth is exactly $w=p$.\n\nThe set of nonzero diagonals is defined by the offsets $d=j-i$ where $A_{ij} \\neq 0$. We have shown that the maximum offset is $p$ and the minimum is $-p$. We must confirm that all diagonals between $-p$ and $p$ contain at least one nonzero entry.\nConsider an interior element $K_e$. Its nodes are indexed from $i_{start}=(e-1)p$ to $i_{end}=ep$. Pick node $i=i_{start}$. It is connected to all other nodes in the element, including $j = i_{start}+d$ for all $d \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$. Thus, the super-diagonals $1, 2, \\dots, p$ all have nonzero entries.\nSince the bilinear form is symmetric, $a(u,v)=a(v,u)$, the matrix $A$ is symmetric ($A_{ij}=A_{ji}$). This means that if the $d$-th super-diagonal is nonzero, so is the $d$-th sub-diagonal (offset $-d$).\nThe main diagonal ($d=0$) is also nonzero, since $A_{ii} = \\int_{0}^{1} (a(x)(\\phi_i'(x))^2 + c(x)(\\phi_i(x))^2)dx  0$ because $a(x)0$ and $\\phi_i$ is not identically zero.\n\nSo, the nonzero diagonals are for offsets $d \\in \\{-p, -p+1, \\dots, -1, 0, 1, \\dots, p-1, p\\}$.\nThe total number of such diagonals is $p$ (sub-diagonals) $+ 1$ (main diagonal) $+ p$ (super-diagonals).\nThe total number of nonzero diagonals is $2p+1$.",

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two main parts: first, the derivation of a saddle-point weak formulation for the Poisson problem on a decomposed domain, and second, the stability analysis of a specific non-matching grid discretization of this formulation.\n\n### Part 1: Continuous Weak Formulation\n\nWe start with the strong form of the Poisson problem on two subdomains $\\Omega_1$ and $\\Omega_2$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\Delta u_1 = f  \\text{in } \\Omega_1, \\\\\n-\\Delta u_2 = f  \\text{in } \\Omega_2.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe global solution $u$ is required to be continuous and have continuous normal flux across the interface $\\Gamma$, and to satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet condition $u=0$ on the exterior boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. This translates to the following conditions for $u_1$ and $u_2$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Boundary conditions: $u_1=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega_1 \\cap \\partial\\Omega$ and $u_2=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega_2 \\cap \\partial\\Omega$.\n    \\item Interface conditions on $\\Gamma$:\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item Continuity of the solution: $u_1 = u_2$.\n            \\item Continuity of the normal flux: $\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial n_1} + \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial n_2} = 0$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the outward unit normal vectors to $\\Omega_1$ and $\\Omega_2$ respectively. On $\\Gamma$, we have $n_1 = -n_2$.\n        \\end{itemize}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nTo derive the weak formulation, we introduce test functions $v_1$ and $v_2$. We define the function spaces for the trial functions $(u_1, u_2)$ and test functions $(v_1, v_2)$ as $V = V_1 \\times V_2$, where\n$$ V_i = \\{w \\in H^1(\\Omega_i) \\mid w = 0 \\text{ on } \\partial\\Omega_i \\cap \\partial\\Omega \\}, \\quad \\text{for } i=1,2. $$\nWe multiply the PDE in each subdomain by the corresponding test function $v_i \\in V_i$ and integrate over $\\Omega_i$. Applying integration by parts (Green's first identity), we get:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_1} \\nabla u_1 \\cdot \\nabla v_1 \\, \\mathrm{d}x - \\int_{\\partial\\Omega_1} v_1 \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial n_1} \\, \\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{\\Omega_1} f v_1 \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_2} \\nabla u_2 \\cdot \\nabla v_2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x - \\int_{\\partial\\Omega_2} v_2 \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial n_2} \\, \\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{\\Omega_2} f v_2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\nThe boundary integrals are non-zero only on the interface $\\Gamma$, since $v_i=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega_i \\cap \\partial\\Omega$. Summing the two equations gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1,2} \\int_{\\Omega_i} \\nabla u_i \\cdot \\nabla v_i \\, \\mathrm{d}x - \\int_{\\Gamma} \\left( v_1 \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial n_1} + v_2 \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial n_2} \\right) \\mathrm{d}s = \\sum_{i=1,2} \\int_{\\Omega_i} f v_i \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\nThe continuity of flux condition can be used to define a single quantity on the interface, the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, which represents the flux. Let's define $\\lambda = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial n_1}|_\\Gamma$. From the flux continuity, we then have $\\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial n_2}|_\\Gamma = -\\lambda$. Substituting this into the interface integral yields:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Gamma} \\left(v_1 \\lambda - v_2 \\lambda \\right) \\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\lambda (v_1 - v_2) \\, \\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nThe continuity condition $u_1=u_2$ on $\\Gamma$ is enforced weakly. We introduce a multiplier test space $M$. For the continuous problem, the appropriate space for the multiplier $\\lambda$ (which represents a flux, i.e., a normal derivative) is $M = H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)$, the dual space of the trace space $H^{1/2}(\\Gamma)$. The weak enforcement of continuity is expressed as:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Gamma} \\mu (u_1 - u_2) \\, \\mathrm{d}s = 0, \\quad \\forall \\mu \\in M.\n$$\nNow we assemble the complete saddle-point problem. Let $u=(u_1, u_2)$ and $v=(v_1, v_2)$. Define the bilinear forms and the linear functional:\n$$\na(u,v) = \\sum_{i=1,2} \\int_{\\Omega_i} \\nabla u_i \\cdot \\nabla v_i \\, \\mathrm{d}x,\n$$\n$$\nb(\\mu, v) = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\mu (\\gamma v_1 - \\gamma v_2) \\, \\mathrm{d}s,\n$$\n$$\nL(v) = \\sum_{i=1,2} \\int_{\\Omega_i} f v_i \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the trace operator onto $\\Gamma$. The problem statement suggests a bilinear form $b(\\lambda, v)$ with a positive sign in the first variational equation. This corresponds to defining $\\lambda = -\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial n_1}|_\\Gamma$. With this convention, the system is:\nFind $(u, \\lambda) \\in V \\times M$ such that\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na(u,v) + b(\\lambda,v) = L(v)  \\forall v \\in V, \\\\\nb(\\mu, u) = 0  \\forall \\mu \\in M.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is the coupled variational formulation.\n\n### Part 2: Discrete Stability Analysis\n\nWe now analyze the stability of the given discretization. The discrete spaces are $V_h = V_{1,h} \\times V_{2,h}$ and $M_h$. The stability is governed by the discrete inf-sup (or LBB) constant:\n$$\n\\beta_M(h) \\;=\\; \\inf_{\\lambda_h\\in M_h\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\;\\sup_{v_h\\in V_h\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\;\\frac{b(\\lambda_h,v_h)}{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{M}\\,\\|v_h\\|_V}\\,,\n$$\nwhere $v_h=(v_{1,h}, v_{2,h})$ and $\\|v_h\\|_V^2 = \\|\\nabla v_{1,h}\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}^2 + \\|\\nabla v_{2,h}\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_2)}^2$. We need to find the scaling of $\\beta_M(h)$ with $h$ for two choices of the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_M$.\n\n#### Case 1: The $H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)$ norm\n\nThe first choice is $\\|\\lambda_h\\|_M = \\|\\lambda_h\\|_{H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)}$. This norm is defined by duality:\n$$\n\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)} = \\sup_{g \\in H^{1/2}(\\Gamma) \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{\\langle \\lambda_h, g \\rangle_{\\Gamma}}{\\|g\\|_{H^{1/2}(\\Gamma)}},\n$$\nwhere $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_{\\Gamma}$ is the $L^2(\\Gamma)$ inner product, which represents the duality pairing between $H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)$ and $H^{1/2}(\\Gamma)$.\n\nThe chosen discretization, with piecewise-linear elements on non-matching grids ($h$ and $2h$) and piecewise-constant multipliers on the coarser grid ($2h$), is a standard example of a stable mortar finite element method. A fundamental result in the theory of mortar methods (by Bernardi, Maday, and Patera) states that for such a choice of spaces, the discrete inf-sup constant is bounded below by a positive constant independent of the mesh size $h$. That is,\n$$\n\\beta_{H^{-1/2}}(h) \\ge \\beta_0  0,\n$$\nfor some constant $\\beta_0$ that does not depend on $h$. This uniform stability is the reason for this specific choice of multiplier space in practice. Since $\\beta_{H^{-1/2}}(h)$ is bounded below by a positive constant, its leading-order asymptotic scaling is as a constant.\n$$\n\\beta_{H^{-1/2}}(h) \\approx C' h^0.\n$$\nThus, the exponent is $\\alpha_{H^{-1/2}} = 0$.\n\n#### Case 2: The $L^2(\\Gamma)$ norm\n\nThe second choice is $\\|\\lambda_h\\|_M = \\|\\lambda_h\\|_{L^2(\\Gamma)}$. The inf-sup constant is\n$$\n\\beta_{L^2}(h) \\;=\\; \\inf_{\\lambda_h\\in M_h\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\;\\sup_{v_h\\in V_h\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\;\\frac{b(\\lambda_h,v_h)}{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{L^2(\\Gamma)}\\,\\|v_h\\|_V}\\,.\n$$\nWe can relate $\\beta_{L^2}(h)$ to $\\beta_{H^{-1/2}}(h)$ by analyzing the relationship between the $L^2(\\Gamma)$ and $H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)$ norms on the discrete multiplier space $M_h$. For any $\\lambda_h \\in M_h$, we can write:\n$$\n\\sup_{v_h\\in V_h} \\frac{b(\\lambda_h,v_h)}{\\|v_h\\|_V} \\ge \\beta_{H^{-1/2}}(h) \\|\\lambda_h\\|_{H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)} \\ge \\beta_0 \\|\\lambda_h\\|_{H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)}.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\beta_{L^2}(h)$:\n$$\n\\beta_{L^2}(h) = \\inf_{\\lambda_h\\in M_h} \\frac{\\sup_{v_h} b(\\lambda_h,v_h)/\\|v_h\\|_V}{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{L^2(\\Gamma)}} \\ge \\beta_0 \\inf_{\\lambda_h\\in M_h} \\frac{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)}}{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{L^2(\\Gamma)}}.\n$$\nThe analysis thus shifts to finding the scaling of the infimum of the norm ratio. For a finite element space defined on a quasi-uniform mesh of size $H$, a standard inverse inequality holds. The space $M_h$ consists of piecewise-constant functions on a partition of $\\Gamma$ of size $H=2h$. The relevant inverse inequality relating the $L^2$ and $H^{-1/2}$ norms is:\n$$\n\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{L^2(\\Gamma)} \\le C H^{-1/2} \\|\\lambda_h\\|_{H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)} \\quad \\forall \\lambda_h \\in M_h.\n$$\nRearranging this inequality, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)}}{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{L^2(\\Gamma)}} \\ge C^{-1} H^{1/2} = C^{-1} (2h)^{1/2}.\n$$\nThis inequality holds for all $\\lambda_h \\in M_h$, so the infimum over $M_h$ must also satisfy this scaling:\n$$\n\\inf_{\\lambda_h\\in M_h} \\frac{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{H^{-1/2}(\\Gamma)}}{\\|\\lambda_h\\|_{L^2(\\Gamma)}} \\ge C' h^{1/2}.\n$$\nThis provides a lower bound for the scaling of the inf-sup constant: $\\beta_{L^2}(h) \\ge \\beta_0 C' h^{1/2}$.\n\nTo show this scaling is sharp, we must demonstrate that $\\beta_{L^2}(h) \\le C'' h^{1/2}$. This is typically done by constructing a \"worst-case\" multiplier function $\\lambda_h^* \\in M_h$ for which the supremum over $v_h$ is small. A canonical choice is a highly oscillatory function, such as a \"checkerboard\" function which alternates sign on adjacent segments of the coarse partition (of size $2h$). Let $\\lambda_h^*$ be such a function, normalized so $\\|\\lambda_h^*\\|_{L^2(\\Gamma)}=1$.\nFor this specific choice, it can be shown that\n$$ \\sup_{v_h\\in V_h\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{b(\\lambda_h^*, v_h)}{\\|v_h\\|_V} \\le C'' h^{1/2}. $$\nThis bound arises from a cancellation effect. It is a known property for this mortar setup that for the checkerboard multiplier $\\lambda_h^*$, the term involving the coarse-grid function vanishes: $\\int_\\Gamma \\lambda_h^* v_{2,h}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = 0$ for all $v_{2,h}$ in the trace space of $V_{2,h}$. The supremum is then determined by the term $\\int_\\Gamma \\lambda_h^* v_{1,h}\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. The mismatch in the mesh sizes ($h$ for $v_{1,h}$ versus $2h$ for $\\lambda_h^*$) leads to this term being of order $h^{1/2} \\|\\nabla v_{1,h}\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_1)}$.\nThis confirms that the scaling is indeed sharp.\n$$\n\\beta_{L^2}(h) \\approx C h^{1/2}.\n$$\nThus, the exponent is $\\alpha_{L^2} = 1/2$.\n\nThe pair of exponents is $(\\alpha_{L^2}, \\alpha_{H^{-1/2}})$.\n\nFinal exponents:\n$\\alpha_{L^2} = 1/2$\n$\\alpha_{H^{-1/2}} = 0$",
