            "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the numerical analysis of partial differential equations, well-posed with a clear objective, and free of any contradictions or ambiguities. The problem presents a classic case study of an unstable numerical scheme and its analysis via the Lax Equivalence Theorem.\n\nWe begin by performing a von Neumann stability analysis for the Forward Time Centered Space (FTCS) scheme applied to the linear advection equation $u_{t}+a\\,u_{x}=0$. The FTCS scheme is given by:\n$$\nu_{j}^{n+1}=u_{j}^{n}-\\frac{a\\,\\Delta t}{2\\,\\Delta x}\\left(u_{j+1}^{n}-u_{j-1}^{n}\\right)\n$$\nIn von Neumann analysis, we consider the behavior of a single Fourier mode of the numerical solution, which is written in the form $u_j^n = G^n e^{i k x_j}$, where $k$ is the wavenumber, $x_j = j\\Delta x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $G$ is the amplification factor which depends on the wavenumber $k$. Substituting this mode into the scheme gives:\n$$\nG^{n+1} e^{i k j \\Delta x} = G^{n} e^{i k j \\Delta x} - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x} \\left( G^n e^{i k (j+1) \\Delta x} - G^n e^{i k (j-1) \\Delta x} \\right)\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by $G^n e^{i k j \\Delta x}$, which is non-zero, yields the amplification factor $G$:\n$$\nG = 1 - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x} \\left( e^{i k \\Delta x} - e^{-i k \\Delta x} \\right)\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $e^{i\\theta} - e^{-i\\theta} = 2i\\sin(\\theta)$, and defining the normalized wavenumber or phase angle as $\\theta = k \\Delta x$, we get:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = 1 - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x} (2i \\sin(\\theta))\n$$\nLet $\\nu = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ be the Courant number. The amplification factor can be expressed concisely as:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = 1 - i \\nu \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nFor a scheme to be stable in the von Neumann sense, the magnitude of the amplification factor must satisfy $|G(\\theta)| \\le 1$ for all possible phase angles $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$. Let us compute the magnitude of $G(\\theta)$. As a complex number, its squared magnitude is the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts:\n$$\n|G(\\theta)|^2 = (\\operatorname{Re}(G))^2 + (\\operatorname{Im}(G))^2 = 1^2 + (-\\nu \\sin(\\theta))^2 = 1 + \\nu^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)\n$$\nThus, the magnitude of the amplification factor is:\n$$\n|G(\\theta)| = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}\n$$\nThe spectral radius, $\\rho(\\nu)$, is defined as the supremum of this magnitude over all possible modes:\n$$\n\\rho(\\nu)=\\sup_{\\theta\\in[-\\pi,\\pi]}|G(\\theta)| = \\sup_{\\theta\\in[-\\pi,\\pi]} \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}\n$$\nTo find this supremum, we must maximize the term $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ over the interval $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$. The maximum value of $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is $1$, which occurs at $\\theta = \\pm \\pi/2$. Therefore, the spectral radius is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\nu) = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2 (1)} = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of the Courant number $\\nu$, we obtain the spectral radius in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\n\\rho = \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2}\n$$\nNow, we use the Lax Equivalence Theorem to explain the scheme's failure to converge. The theorem states that for a well-posed linear initial-value problem, a consistent linear finite difference scheme is convergent if and only if it is stable.\n\nFirst, we check for consistency. A scheme is consistent if its truncation error approaches zero as the grid spacings $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x$ approach zero. The truncation error $T_j^n$ is found by substituting the exact solution $u(x, t)$ of the PDE into the difference equation:\n$$\nT_j^n = \\frac{u(x_j, t^{n+1}) - u(x_j, t^n)}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{a}{2\\Delta x} (u(x_{j+1}, t^n) - u(x_{j-1}, t^n))\n$$\nUsing Taylor series expansions around $(x_j, t^n)$:\n$$\nu(x_j, t^{n+1}) = u(x_j, t^n) + \\Delta t \\, u_t + \\frac{(\\Delta t)^2}{2} u_{tt} + O((\\Delta t)^3)\n$$\n$$\nu(x_{j\\pm 1}, t^n) = u(x_j, t^n) \\pm \\Delta x \\, u_x + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2} u_{xx} \\pm \\frac{(\\Delta x)^3}{6} u_{xxx} + O((\\Delta x)^4)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $T_j^n$:\n$$\nT_j^n = \\left( u_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}u_{tt} + \\dots \\right) + a \\left( u_x + \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{6}u_{xxx} + \\dots \\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_j^n = (u_t + a u_x) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}u_{tt} + a\\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{6}u_{xxx} + \\dots\n$$\nSince $u(x,t)$ is the exact solution, $u_t + a u_x = 0$. The principal part of the truncation error is $O(\\Delta t, (\\Delta x)^2)$. As $\\Delta t \\to 0$ and $\\Delta x \\to 0$, the truncation error $T_j^n \\to 0$. Thus, the FTCS scheme is consistent with the advection equation.\n\nNext, we check for stability. As derived from the von Neumann analysis, the magnitude of the amplification factor is $|G(\\theta)| = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}$. The problem specifies $a \\ne 0$, $\\Delta t  0$, and implicitly $\\Delta x  0$. Therefore, the Courant number $\\nu = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ is non-zero. For any mode with $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ such that $\\sin(\\theta) \\ne 0$ (which is true for almost all modes), the term $\\nu^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)$ is strictly positive. This implies:\n$$\n|G(\\theta)| = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}  1\n$$\nSince the stability condition $|G(\\theta)| \\le 1$ is violated for all $\\nu \\ne 0$ and for almost all modes, the FTCS scheme is unconditionally unstable. The spectral radius $\\rho = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2}$ is strictly greater than $1$ for any non-zero $\\nu$.\n\nAccording to the Lax Equivalence Theorem, convergence requires both consistency and stability. We have established that the FTCS scheme is consistent but unconditionally unstable. The failure to satisfy the stability condition means that the scheme is not convergent. The physical interpretation is that numerical errors, particularly in the high-frequency modes (where $|\\sin(\\theta)|$ is large), are amplified at every time step, leading to an exponential growth that quickly contaminates and overwhelms the true solution. This unconditional instability is the reason the FTCS scheme fails to converge for the linear advection equation.",

The parameters are given as $\\nu0$, $\\Delta t0$, and $\\Delta x0$. The term $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\xi\\,\\Delta x}{2}\\right)$ is always real and non-negative.

The amplification factor is $g(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{1+A}$. Since $A \\ge 0$, the denominator $1+A \\ge 1$. Consequently, $g(\\xi)$ is a real number satisfying $0  g(\\xi) \\leq 1$. This immediately implies $|g(\\xi)| = g(\\xi) \\leq 1$. This inequality holds for all wavenumbers $\\xi$ and for any choice of $\\Delta t  0$ and $\\Delta x  0$.\n\nNext, we justify that the scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent.\nFor a linear finite difference scheme applied to a linear PDE with constant coefficients and periodic boundary conditions, the von Neumann stability analysis is both necessary and sufficient for stability in the sense of Lax-Richtmyer. The von Neumann condition for stability requires that $|g(\\xi)| \\leq 1 + O(\\Delta t)$ for all relevant wavenumbers $\\xi$. We have shown the much stronger condition $|g(\\xi)| \\leq 1$, which holds for all $\\Delta t  0$ and $\\Delta x  0$ without any restriction on their ratio. This proves that the scheme is unconditionally stable.\n\nThe Lax Equivalence Theorem states that for a well-posed linear initial-value problem, a consistent linear finite difference scheme is convergent if and only if it is stable.\n1. The initial-value problem for the linear diffusion equation $u_{t}=\\nu\\,u_{xx}$ is well-posed.\n2. The given finite difference scheme is linear.\n3. The problem statement permits us to assume the scheme is consistent. A check via Taylor series expansion shows the truncation error is $O(\\Delta t) + O(\\Delta x^2)$, so the scheme is indeed consistent.\n4. We have proven that the scheme is unconditionally stable.\n\nBy the Lax Equivalence Theorem, these conditions together imply that the backward Euler scheme is unconditionally convergent for this problem.\n\nFinally, we compute the supremum of the modulus of the amplification factor:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\xi\\in[-\\pi/\\Delta x,\\pi/\\Delta x]} |g(\\xi)|\n$$\nWe have already shown that $|g(\\xi)|=g(\\xi)$ and is given by:\n$$\n|g(\\xi)| = \\frac{1}{1 + 4\\frac{\\nu\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\xi\\,\\Delta x}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nTo find the supremum of this expression, we must find the minimum of its denominator, as the numerator is constant. The denominator is $D(\\xi) = 1 + 4\\frac{\\nu\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\xi\\,\\Delta x}{2}\\right)$. Since $\\nu$, $\\Delta t$, and $\\Delta x^2$ are all positive constants, minimizing $D(\\xi)$ is equivalent to minimizing the term $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\xi\\,\\Delta x}{2}\\right)$.\nThe wavenumber $\\xi$ is in the range $[-\\pi/\\Delta x, \\pi/\\Delta x]$, so the argument of the sine function, $\\theta = \\frac{\\xi\\,\\Delta x}{2}$, is in the range $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$. Over this interval, the minimum value of $\\sin^2(\\theta)$ is $0$, which occurs at $\\theta=0$. This corresponds to $\\xi=0$.\nAt $\\xi=0$, the denominator becomes:\n$$\nD(0) = 1 + 4\\frac{\\nu\\,\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}\\sin^2(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n$$\nThe value of $|g(\\xi)|$ at this point is $|g(0)| = 1/1 = 1$. Since the denominator $D(\\xi)$ is always greater than or equal to $1$, the value of $|g(\\xi)|$ is always less than or equal to $1$. The value of $1$ is achieved within the domain of $\\xi$, so the supremum is also the maximum.\nThus, the supremum of the modulus of the amplification factor is $1$.\n$$\n\\sup_{\\xi\\in[-\\pi/\\Delta x,\\pi/\\Delta x]} |g(\\xi)| = 1\n$$",

For $C0$, we can divide by $C$:\n$$\n-2\\theta + \\theta^2 C + \\lambda^2(2-C) \\le 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms as a linear function of $C$:\n$$\n(2\\lambda^2 - 2\\theta) + C(\\theta^2 - \\lambda^2) \\le 0\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $C \\in (0, 2]$. Let's define the function $F(C) = (2\\lambda^2 - 2\\theta) + C(\\theta^2 - \\lambda^2)$. Since $F(C)$ is linear in $C$, for it to be non-positive over the interval $(0, 2]$, it suffices to check its values at the boundaries of the interval, $C \\to 0^+$ and $C=2$.\n\nCondition 1: As $C \\to 0^+$, we must have $F(0^+) \\le 0$.\n$$\n2\\lambda^2 - 2\\theta \\le 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 \\le \\theta\n$$\nCondition 2: At $C=2$ (which corresponds to $\\xi=\\pm\\pi$), we must have $F(2) \\le 0$.\n$$\n(2\\lambda^2 - 2\\theta) + 2(\\theta^2 - \\lambda^2) \\le 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\lambda^2 - 2\\theta + 2\\theta^2 - 2\\lambda^2 \\le 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\theta^2 - 2\\theta \\le 0 \\implies 2\\theta(\\theta-1) \\le 0\n$$\nThis last inequality holds if and only if $0 \\le \\theta \\le 1$.\n\nCombining these two necessary conditions, we find that for the scheme to be stable, the parameters $(\\lambda, \\theta)$ must satisfy:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 \\le \\theta \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0 \\le \\theta \\le 1\n$$\nThese conditions are also sufficient. If they hold, the function $F(C)$ is non-positive at both ends of the interval $[0, 2]$. Since $F(C)$ is linear, it must be non-positive for all $C \\in [0, 2]$. Thus, the condition $|g(\\xi)|^2 \\le 1$ holds for all $\\xi$. The necessary and sufficient condition for $\\ell^2$-stability is $\\lambda^2 \\le \\theta \\le 1$.\n\n**2. The Stability Region in the $(\\lambda, \\theta)$-Plane**\n\nThe stability region is the set of all points $(\\lambda, \\theta)$ in the plane that satisfy the conditions $\\lambda^2 \\le \\theta$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 1$.\nThe second condition, $0 \\le \\theta \\le 1$, restricts the region to a horizontal strip between the lines $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=1$.\nThe first condition, $\\lambda^2 \\le \\theta$, means that for a given $\\lambda$, stable values of $\\theta$ must lie on or above the parabola $\\theta=\\lambda^2$.\nCombining these, the stability region is the area in the $(\\lambda, \\theta)$-plane that is on and above the parabola $\\theta = \\lambda^2$ and on and below the line $\\theta = 1$.\nThe boundaries of this region are the curves:\n- The parabola $\\theta = \\lambda^2$.\n- The horizontal line segment $\\theta = 1$ for $\\lambda \\in [-1, 1]$.\nThe points of intersection are found by setting $\\lambda^2 = 1$, which gives $\\lambda = \\pm 1$. The intersection points are $(-1, 1)$ and $(1, 1)$. The vertex of the parabola is at $(0, 0)$. The full stability region is thus described by $\\lambda^2 \\le \\theta \\le 1$, which also implies that $|\\lambda| \\le \\sqrt{\\theta} \\le \\sqrt{1} = 1$. So, stability is only possible if $|\\lambda| \\le 1$.\n\n**3. Convergence and the Lax Equivalence Theorem**\n\nThe Lax Equivalence Theorem states that for a well-posed linear initial-value problem, a consistent linear finite difference scheme is convergent if and only if it is stable.\n\nFirst, we establish consistency. The truncation error $T_j^n$ is obtained by substituting an exact solution $u(x, t)$ of the PDE into the finite difference scheme.\n$$\nT_j^n = \\frac{u_j^{n+1}-u_j^n}{\\Delta t} - \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\left[-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(u_{j+1}^n-u_{j-1}^n) + \\frac{\\theta}{2}(u_{j+1}^n-2u_j^n+u_{j-1}^n) \\right]\n$$\nUsing $\\lambda = a \\Delta t/\\Delta x$, this can be written as:\n$$\nT_j^n = \\frac{u_j^{n+1}-u_j^n}{\\Delta t} + a\\frac{u_{j+1}^n-u_{j-1}^n}{2\\Delta x} - \\frac{\\theta \\Delta x^2}{2\\Delta t}\\frac{u_{j+1}^n-2u_j^n+u_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nTaylor expanding each term around $(x_j, t_n)$:\n- $\\frac{u_j^{n+1}-u_j^n}{\\Delta t} = u_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}u_{tt} + O(\\Delta t^2)$\n- $\\frac{u_{j+1}^n-u_{j-1}^n}{2\\Delta x} = u_x + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{6}u_{xxx} + O(\\Delta x^4)$\n- $\\frac{u_{j+1}^n-2u_j^n+u_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2} = u_{xx} + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{12}u_{xxxx} + O(\\Delta x^4)$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $T_j^n$:\n$$\nT_j^n = (u_t + au_x) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}u_{tt} + a\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{6}u_{xxx} - \\frac{\\theta \\Delta x^2}{2\\Delta t}u_{xx} + \\text{h.o.t.}\n$$\nSince $u$ is a solution to the PDE, $u_t+au_x=0$. Also, differentiating the PDE gives $u_{tt} = a^2 u_{xx}$.\n$$\nT_j^n = \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}a^2 u_{xx} - \\frac{\\theta \\Delta x^2}{2\\Delta t}u_{xx} + \\text{h.o.t.} = \\left(\\frac{a^2 \\Delta t}{2} - \\frac{\\theta \\Delta x^2}{2\\Delta t}\\right)u_{xx} + \\text{h.o.t.}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten using $\\lambda = a\\Delta t/\\Delta x$:\n$$\nT_j^n = \\frac{a^2\\Delta t}{2\\lambda^2}(\\lambda^2-\\theta)u_{xx} + \\text{h.o.t.}\n$$\nIf $\\Delta t, \\Delta x \\to 0$ while $\\lambda$ is held fixed, then $\\Delta x$ is proportional to $\\Delta t$. The leading term of the truncation error is $O(\\Delta t)$. As $\\Delta t \\to 0$, $T_j^n \\to 0$. Thus, the scheme is consistent for any choice of $\\lambda$ and $\\theta$.\n\nWith consistency established, the Lax Equivalence Theorem applies directly:\n- In the entire stability region, $\\lambda^2 \\le \\theta \\le 1$, the scheme is stable. Since it is also consistent, it is convergent. The numerical solution will approach the true solution of $u_t + a u_x = 0$ as $\\Delta t, \\Delta x \\to 0$ (with fixed $\\lambda$).\n- Outside this region, the scheme is unstable ($|g(\\xi)|  1$ for some $\\xi$). An unstable scheme cannot be convergent. Small errors (like round-off errors) will be amplified at each time step, leading to an exponential growth that completely overwhelms the true solution. Hence, the scheme is not convergent outside the stability region.\n\n**Determination of $\\Theta(\\lambda)$**\n\nThe problem asks for the function $\\Theta(\\lambda)$, defined as the infimum of the set of stabilizing parameters $\\theta \\in [0, 1]$ for a given $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\Theta(\\lambda) = \\inf\\left\\{\\theta\\in[0,1]:\\; (\\lambda,\\theta)\\ \\text{is}\\ \\ell^{2}\\text{-stable}\\right\\}\n$$\nThis is to be determined for $|\\lambda| \\le 1$. From our stability analysis, for a fixed value of $\\lambda$ such that $|\\lambda| \\le 1$, the set of values of $\\theta$ that render the scheme stable is given by the inequality $\\lambda^2 \\le \\theta \\le 1$. The problem further constrains $\\theta$ to the interval $[0, 1]$. The intersection of these two conditions is simply the interval $[\\lambda^2, 1]$, since for $|\\lambda| \\le 1$, we have $0 \\le \\lambda^2 \\le 1$.\n\nSo, for a fixed $\\lambda$ with $|\\lambda| \\le 1$, the set of stable $\\theta$ values in $[0,1]$ is the closed interval $[\\lambda^2, 1]$. The infimum (greatest lower bound) of this set is its minimum value, which is the left endpoint of the interval.\n$$\n\\Theta(\\lambda) = \\inf[\\lambda^2, 1] = \\lambda^2\n$$\nThis function $\\Theta(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2$ represents the smallest amount of artificial viscosity (as parameterized by $\\theta$) that must be added to the unstable Forward-Time Central-Space scheme ($\\theta=0$) to achieve stability for a given Courant number $\\lambda$. Choosing $\\theta = \\lambda^2$ yields the Lax-Wendroff scheme, which is second-order accurate.",
