This is satisfied if for every row $i$, the condition $|m_{ii}| + R_i < 1$ holds.\n\n**Analysis of Jacobi Convergence Certification**\nFor $T_J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & p \\\\ q & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n- Row 1: The center is $m_{11} = 0$. The radius is $R_1 = |p| = p$ (since $p>0$). The condition for this disk is $|0| + p < 1$, which simplifies to $p < 1$.\n- Row 2: The center is $m_{22} = 0$. The radius is $R_2 = |q| = q$ (since $q>0$). The condition for this disk is $|0| + q < 1$, which simplifies to $q < 1$.\nGerschgorin's theorem certifies Jacobi convergence if and only if both $p < 1$ and $q < 1$. Certification fails if $p \\geq 1$ or $q \\geq 1$.\n\n**Analysis of Gauss-Seidel Convergence Certification**\nFor $T_{GS} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & p \\\\ 0 & pq \\end{pmatrix}$:\n- Row 1: The center is $m_{11} = 0$. The radius is $R_1 = |p| = p$. The condition for this disk is $|0| + p < 1$, which is $p < 1$.\n- Row 2: The center is $m_{22} = pq$. The radius is $R_2 = |0| = 0$. The condition for this disk is $|pq| + 0 < 1$. Since $p>0$ and $q>0$, this simplifies to $pq < 1$.\nGerschgorin's theorem certifies Gauss-Seidel convergence if and only if both $p < 1$ and $pq < 1$.\n\n**Finding Conditions on $p$ and $q$**\nWe need to find conditions on $p$ and $q$ such that:\n1. Gauss-Seidel convergence is certified: $p < 1$ AND $pq < 1$.\n2. Jacobi convergence certification fails: $p \\geq 1$ OR $q \\geq 1$.\n\nCombining these, we need ($p < 1$ AND $pq < 1$) AND ($p \\geq 1$ OR $q \\geq 1$).\nThe condition $p < 1$ from the first part makes the $p \\geq 1$ part of the second condition impossible. Thus, the conditions simplify to:\n$p < 1$, $pq < 1$, and $q \\geq 1$.\n\nLet us verify these conditions using the provided parameters $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $q = \\frac{8}{5}$.\n- $p = \\frac{1}{2} < 1$. This condition is met.\n- $q = \\frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \\geq 1$. This condition is met.\n- $pq = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{8}{5}\\right) = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5} < 1$. This condition is met.\nThe chosen parameters indeed satisfy the derived requirements.\n\n**Computation of the Spectral Radius**\nFinally, we compute the spectral radius of the Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix, $\\rho(T_{GS})$, for the specific parameters $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $q = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nThe matrix is $T_{GS} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & p \\\\ 0 & pq \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nT_{GS} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{8}{5}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{4}{5} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $T_{GS}$ is an upper triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{4}{5}$.\nThe spectral radius is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\rho(T_{GS}) = \\max(|\\lambda_1|, |\\lambda_2|) = \\max\\left(|0|, \\left|\\frac{4}{5}\\right|\\right) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{4}{5}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\nThis value is less than $1$, confirming that the Gauss-Seidel method does converge for these parameters, as certified by the Gerschgorin analysis.\nThe final answer is the exact value of this spectral radius.",
