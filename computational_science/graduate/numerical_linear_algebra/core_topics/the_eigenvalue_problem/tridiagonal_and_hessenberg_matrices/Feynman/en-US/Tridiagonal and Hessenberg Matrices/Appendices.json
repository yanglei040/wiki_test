It requests the derivation of fundamental properties of a symmetric tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix and the solution of an optimization problem related to spectral transformations. The derivation will proceed in three parts as outlined in the problem statement.\n\n(i) Derivation of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n\nLet $T(a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ be the specified real symmetric tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue and $v = [v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n]^T$ be the corresponding eigenvector, where $v \\neq 0$. The eigenvalue equation is $T(a,b)v = \\lambda v$. This expands into a system of $n$ linear equations. For a generic row $i$, where $2 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we have:\n$$ b v_{i-1} + a v_i + b v_{i+1} = \\lambda v_i $$\nThis can be rewritten as a second-order homogeneous linear difference equation:\n$$ b v_{i+1} + (a-\\lambda) v_i + b v_{i-1} = 0 $$\nThe equations for the first and last rows are:\n$$ a v_1 + b v_2 = \\lambda v_1 \\implies (a-\\lambda)v_1 + b v_2 = 0 $$\n$$ b v_{n-1} + a v_n = \\lambda v_n \\implies b v_{n-1} + (a-\\lambda)v_n = 0 $$\nTo make these two boundary equations fit the general recurrence relation form, we can define ghost components $v_0$ and $v_{n+1}$. The first equation becomes $b v_0 + (a-\\lambda)v_1 + b v_2 = 0$ if we impose the boundary condition $v_0 = 0$. The last equation becomes $b v_{n-1} + (a-\\lambda)v_n + b v_{n+1} = 0$ if we impose $v_{n+1} = 0$.\n\nWe seek a non-trivial solution to the recurrence $b v_{i+1} + (a-\\lambda) v_i + b v_{i-1} = 0$ subject to $v_0 = 0$ and $v_{n+1} = 0$. Let us propose a solution of the form $v_j = \\sin(j\\theta)$ for some parameter $\\theta$. The condition $v_0 = \\sin(0\\theta) = 0$ is automatically satisfied. Substituting this form into the recurrence relation gives:\n$$ b \\sin((i+1)\\theta) + (a-\\lambda)\\sin(i\\theta) + b\\sin((i-1)\\theta) = 0 $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(A\\pm B) = \\sin(A)\\cos(B) \\pm \\cos(A)\\sin(B)$, we get:\n$$ b(\\sin(i\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(i\\theta)\\sin(\\theta)) + (a-\\lambda)\\sin(i\\theta) + b(\\sin(i\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - \\cos(i\\theta)\\sin(\\theta)) = 0 $$\n$$ 2b\\sin(i\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) + (a-\\lambda)\\sin(i\\theta) = 0 $$\n$$ (2b\\cos(\\theta) + a - \\lambda) \\sin(i\\theta) = 0 $$\nFor this equation to hold for all $i=1, \\dots, n$ for a non-trivial eigenvector (i.e., not all $\\sin(i\\theta)$ are zero), the first factor must be zero:\n$$ 2b\\cos(\\theta) + a - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda = a + 2b\\cos(\\theta) $$\nThis expression gives the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ in terms of the parameter $\\theta$. Now we must use the second boundary condition, $v_{n+1}=0$, to determine the permissible values of $\\theta$.\n$$ v_{n+1} = \\sin((n+1)\\theta) = 0 $$\nThis implies $(n+1)\\theta = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. Thus, $\\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{n+1}$.\nFor $k=1, 2, \\dots, n$, we obtain $n$ distinct sets of eigenvectors. For $k=0$ or $k=n+1$, $\\theta$ is $0$ or $\\pi$, leading to the trivial vector $v_j = 0$ for all $j$. Other integer values of $k$ yield eigenvectors that are linearly dependent on these $n$ vectors. We denote the distinct eigenvalues and eigenvectors by an index $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_k = a + 2b \\cos\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n+1}\\right), \\quad k = 1, 2, \\dots, n $$\nThe corresponding unnormalized eigenvectors $v^{(k)}$ have components:\n$$ v_j^{(k)} = \\sin\\left(\\frac{jk\\pi}{n+1}\\right), \\quad j = 1, 2, \\dots, n $$\nTo obtain the final expression, we normalize these eigenvectors to have a Euclidean norm of $1$. The squared norm is:\n$$ \\|v^{(k)}\\|_2^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{jk\\pi}{n+1}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2jk\\pi}{n+1}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Re}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2jk\\pi}{n+1}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe sum is a geometric series which evaluates to $-1$. Therefore, the squared norm is $\\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}(-1) = \\frac{n+1}{2}$. The normalization constant is $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n+1}}$.\nThe components of the normalized eigenvector $v^{(k)}$ are:\n$$ v_j^{(k)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n+1}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{jk\\pi}{n+1}\\right), \\quad j = 1, 2, \\dots, n $$\n\n(ii) Eigenvector Condition Number\n\nFor a symmetric matrix, a first-order perturbation analysis (such as the Davis-Kahan theorem) shows that the sensitivity of an eigenvector $v_k$ to a normwise perturbation in the matrix is inversely proportional to the minimum separation between its eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$ and the rest of the spectrum. We define the normwise first-order eigenvector condition number $\\kappa_k$ as:\n$$ \\kappa_k = \\frac{1}{\\min_{m \\neq k} |\\lambda_k - \\lambda_m|} $$\nThe term \"nearly repeated adjacent pair at indices $j$ and $j+1$\" implies that the gap $|\\lambda_j - \\lambda_{j+1}|$ is small and is the dominant term in the conditioning of both $v_j$ and $v_{j+1}$. The gap between adjacent eigenvalues is:\n$$ |\\lambda_{k+1} - \\lambda_k| = \\left|\\left(a + 2b\\cos\\left(\\frac{(k+1)\\pi}{n+1}\\right)\\right) - \\left(a + 2b\\cos\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n+1}\\right)\\right)\\right| = 2|b| \\left|\\cos\\left(\\frac{(k+1)\\pi}{n+1}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n+1}\\right)\\right| $$\nUsing the identity $\\cos A - \\cos B = -2\\sin\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$, this becomes:\n$$ |\\lambda_{k+1} - \\lambda_k| = 4|b| \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right) $$\nFor large $n$ with fixed $k$, both sine arguments are small. Using the approximation $\\sin(x) \\approx x$ for small $x$:\n$$ |\\lambda_{k+1} - \\lambda_k| \\approx 4|b| \\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right) = |b| \\frac{\\pi^2(2k+1)}{(n+1)^2} $$\nThe condition number $\\kappa_j$ depends on the minimal gap around $\\lambda_j$. The problem's context implies this minimal gap is with an adjacent eigenvalue, and the focus on the pair $(j, j+1)$ suggests we examine the gap $|\\lambda_j - \\lambda_{j+1}|$. If we take this as the minimal gap for $\\lambda_j$, then for large $n$ and fixed $j$:\n$$ \\kappa_j = \\frac{1}{|\\lambda_j - \\lambda_{j+1}|} \\approx \\frac{(n+1)^2}{|b|\\pi^2(2j+1)} $$\nThis condition number grows quadratically with $n$, highlighting the sensitivity of eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues at the spectral edges, where gaps are smallest.\n\n(iii) Optimal Shift for Shift-Invert Transformation\n\nThe shift-invert transformation maps $T(a,b)$ to $(T(a,b)-\\sigma I)^{-1}$. The eigenvectors are preserved, and the eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ are transformed to $\\mu_k = 1/(\\lambda_k - \\sigma)$. To improve the numerical stability of computing the eigenvectors for the nearly repeated pair $(\\lambda_j, \\lambda_{j+1})$, we want to maximize their separation in the transformed spectrum, which is $|\\mu_j - \\mu_{j+1}|$.\nThe problem, however, poses the equivalent and more direct minimax problem: find the real shift $\\sigma$ that maximizes the minimum distance from $\\sigma$ to the pair of eigenvalues $\\lambda_j$ and $\\lambda_{j+1}$. Let this objective function be $f(\\sigma)$:\n$$ f(\\sigma) = \\min\\{|\\lambda_j - \\sigma|, |\\lambda_{j+1} - \\sigma|\\} $$\nLet's assume, without loss of generality, that $\\lambda_j \\le \\lambda_{j+1}$. The function $f(\\sigma)$ is the lower envelope of two V-shaped functions $|x-\\lambda_j|$ and $|x-\\lambda_{j+1}|$. The maximum value of this lower envelope occurs at the point where the two distances are equal:\n$$ |\\lambda_j - \\sigma| = |\\lambda_{j+1} - \\sigma| $$\nIf $\\sigma$ is between $\\lambda_j$ and $\\lambda_{j+1}$, this equality becomes $\\sigma - \\lambda_j = \\lambda_{j+1} - \\sigma$. Solving for $\\sigma$ yields the unique optimal shift $\\sigma^*$:\n$$ 2\\sigma = \\lambda_j + \\lambda_{j+1} \\implies \\sigma^* = \\frac{\\lambda_j + \\lambda_{j+1}}{2} $$\nThe optimal shift is the midpoint of the two eigenvalues. This choice also maximizes the separation $|\\mu_j - \\mu_{j+1}|$, since $|\\mu_j - \\mu_{j+1}| = \\frac{|\\lambda_{j+1}-\\lambda_j|}{|(\\lambda_j-\\sigma)(\\lambda_{j+1}-\\sigma)|}$ and $\\sigma^*$ minimizes the magnitude of the denominator. It also ensures that the conditioning of the matrix inversion with respect to this pair is balanced.\n\nTo find the explicit expression for $\\sigma^*$, we substitute the formulas for $\\lambda_j$ and $\\lambda_{j+1}$ from part (i):\n$$ \\sigma^* = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(a + 2b \\cos\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{n+1}\\right)\\right) + \\left(a + 2b \\cos\\left(\\frac{(j+1)\\pi}{n+1}\\right)\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma^* = a + b \\left( \\cos\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{n+1}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac{(j+1)\\pi}{n+1}\\right) \\right) $$\nUsing the sum-to-product trigonometric identity $\\cos A + \\cos B = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$, with $A = \\frac{(j+1)\\pi}{n+1}$ and $B = \\frac{j\\pi}{n+1}$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{A+B}{2} = \\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{2(n+1)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{A-B}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\sigma^*$ yields the final closed-form solution:\n$$ \\sigma^* = a + 2b \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\right) $$",

From the $(3,2)$ entry, $d_2 \\ell_2 = \\beta$, so $\\ell_2 = \\frac{\\beta}{d_2} = \\frac{\\beta}{(\\beta^2-\\alpha^2)/\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{\\beta^2 - \\alpha^2}$.\n\nThe conditional element growth measure is $g(\\sigma) = \\max\\{|\\ell_1|, |\\ell_2|\\}$. The robustness criterion is $g(\\sigma) \\leq \\rho$.\n$$\n\\max\\left\\{ \\left|-\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right|, \\left|\\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{\\beta^2 - \\alpha^2}\\right| \\right\\} \\leq \\rho.\n$$\nThis is equivalent to satisfying two separate inequalities:\n(i) $|\\ell_1| = \\frac{\\beta}{|\\alpha|} \\leq \\rho$.\n(ii) $|\\ell_2| = \\frac{|\\alpha|\\beta}{|\\beta^2 - \\alpha^2|} \\leq \\rho$.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of $g$ as a function of $|\\alpha|$. In the range $0 < |\\alpha| < \\beta$, the minimum value of $g$ occurs where $|\\ell_1|=|\\ell_2|$, which is at $|\\alpha| = \\beta/\\sqrt{2}$. The value is $g(\\sigma) = \\sqrt{2}$. Since the problem imposes $0 < \\rho < 1$, we have $\\rho  \\sqrt{2}$. This means the condition $g(\\sigma) \\leq \\rho$ cannot be satisfied for any $|\\alpha| \\in (0, \\beta)$, as the minimum value of $g$ in this interval is $\\sqrt{2}$. We must therefore seek a solution where $|\\alpha| > \\beta$.\n\nFor $|\\alpha| > \\beta$, let $x = |\\alpha|$. Then $x^2 - \\beta^2 > 0$. The two inequalities become:\n(i) $\\frac{\\beta}{x} \\leq \\rho \\implies x \\geq \\frac{\\beta}{\\rho}$.\n(ii) $\\frac{x\\beta}{x^2 - \\beta^2} \\leq \\rho$. Since all quantities are positive, we can rearrange:\n$$\nx\\beta \\leq \\rho(x^2 - \\beta^2) \\implies \\rho x^2 - \\beta x - \\rho \\beta^2 \\geq 0.\n$$\nThis is a quadratic inequality in $x$. The roots of the quadratic polynomial $f(x) = \\rho x^2 - \\beta x - \\rho \\beta^2$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-(-\\beta) \\pm \\sqrt{(-\\beta)^2 - 4(\\rho)(-\\rho\\beta^2)}}{2\\rho} = \\frac{\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{\\beta^2 + 4\\rho^2\\beta^2}}{2\\rho} = \\frac{\\beta \\pm \\beta\\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2}}{2\\rho}.\n$$\nSince $x = |\\alpha|  0$, we consider the positive root, $x_+ = \\frac{\\beta(1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2})}{2\\rho}$.\nThe quadratic $f(x)$ represents an upward-opening parabola, so $f(x) \\geq 0$ for $x$ outside the interval between the roots. As $x0$, this means $x \\geq x_+$. So, condition (ii) is satisfied if $x \\geq \\frac{\\beta(1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2})}{2\\rho}$.\n\nTo satisfy the overall robustness criterion, $|\\alpha|$ must satisfy both conditions:\n$$\n|\\alpha| \\geq \\frac{\\beta}{\\rho} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |\\alpha| \\geq \\frac{\\beta(1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2})}{2\\rho}.\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $|\\alpha|$ being greater than or equal to the maximum of the two lower bounds:\n$$\n|\\alpha| \\geq \\max\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\rho}, \\frac{\\beta(1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2})}{2\\rho}\\right).\n$$\nWe compare the two quantities. Since $\\beta  0$ and $\\rho  0$, we only need to compare $\\frac{1}{\\rho}$ and $\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2}}{2\\rho}$, which is equivalent to comparing $2$ and $1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2}$. This simplifies to comparing $1$ and $\\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2}$. Since $\\rho  0$, $4\\rho^2  0$, which implies $1+4\\rho^2  1$, and therefore $\\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2}  1$.\nThus, we have $\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2}}{2\\rho}  \\frac{1}{\\rho}$. The maximum of the two bounds is the larger one.\nThe condition for $|\\alpha|$ simplifies to:\n$$\n|\\alpha| \\geq \\frac{\\beta(1 + \\sqrt{1+4\\rho^2})}{2\\rho}.\n$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal magnitude of the perturbation $|\\alpha|$ that guarantees robustness. This corresponds to the smallest value of $|\\alpha|$ satisfying the aformentioned inequality, which is the lower bound of the interval.",
