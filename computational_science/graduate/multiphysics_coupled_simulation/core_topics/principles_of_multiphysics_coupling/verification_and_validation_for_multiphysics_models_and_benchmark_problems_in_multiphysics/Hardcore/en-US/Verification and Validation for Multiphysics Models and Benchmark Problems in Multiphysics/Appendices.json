Conservation of energy:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla T = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T $$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is the velocity vector, $p'$ is the dynamic pressure, $T$ is the temperature, $\\rho_0$ is a reference density, and $T_0$ is a reference temperature.\n\nWe introduce dimensionless variables using the characteristic scales $L$ (length), $U$ (velocity), and $\\Delta T$ (temperature difference). Let $T_0 = T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{x}' = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{x}}{L}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{u}' = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{u}}{U}, \\quad \\theta = \\frac{T - T_{\\mathrm{cold}}}{\\Delta T}, \\quad p'' = \\frac{p'}{\\rho_0 U^2} $$\nSubstituting these into the energy equation:\n$$ \\frac{U}{L} (\\boldsymbol{u}' \\cdot \\nabla') (\\Delta T \\theta) = \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{L^2} \\nabla'^2 \\theta $$\n$$ (\\boldsymbol{u}' \\cdot \\nabla') \\theta = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{UL}\\right) \\nabla'^2 \\theta $$\nThe dimensionless group is the inverse of the Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{\\alpha}$.\n\nSubstituting into the momentum equation (considering the vertical component $w$ and gravity $\\boldsymbol{g}=-g\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}$):\n$$ \\frac{U^2}{L} (\\boldsymbol{u}' \\cdot \\nabla') w' = -\\frac{\\rho_0 U^2}{\\rho_0 L} \\frac{\\partial p''}{\\partial z'} + \\nu \\frac{U}{L^2} \\nabla'^2 w' - g \\beta (\\Delta T \\theta) $$\nDividing by a characteristic acceleration, e.g., $U^2/L$:\n$$ (\\boldsymbol{u}' \\cdot \\nabla') w' = -\\frac{\\partial p''}{\\partial z'} + \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{UL}\\right) \\nabla'^2 w' - \\left(\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L}{U^2}\\right) \\theta $$\nThis reveals two dimensionless groups in the momentum equation.\n\nAs requested, the standard dimensionless numbers are defined as:\n- Reynolds number: $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$. This is the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.\n- Prandtl number: $\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha}$. This is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity.\n- Grashof number: $\\mathrm{Gr} = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu^2}$. This is the ratio of buoyancy force to viscous force.\n- Rayleigh number: $\\mathrm{Ra} = \\mathrm{Gr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu \\alpha}$.\n\nIn natural convection, the velocity $U$ is not an external parameter but rather is determined by the balance of forces. The solution is governed by the parameters that appear in the problem statement itself, not a velocity we impose. Thus, the behavior of the system is determined by the Grashof and Prandtl numbers. The Reynolds number becomes a dependent variable, $\\mathrm{Re} = f(\\mathrm{Gr}, \\mathrm{Pr})$. The minimal set of independent dimensionless groups controlling the solution is therefore $(\\mathrm{Gr}, \\mathrm{Pr})$, or equivalently $(\\mathrm{Ra}, \\mathrm{Pr})$.\n\n### Part 2: Scaling Analysis for Nusselt Number\n\nWe perform a scaling analysis of the boundary layers near the vertical walls. Let $z$ be the vertical (streamwise) coordinate and $x$ be the horizontal (cross-layer) coordinate. Let $w$ be the vertical velocity. The boundary layer has thickness $\\delta$. The characteristic vertical length scale is taken as $L$.\n- Cross-layer derivatives scale as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta}$.\n- Streamwise derivatives scale as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\sim \\frac{1}{L}$.\n\nThe problem specifies the balances to consider:\n1.  **Momentum Balance**: Buoyancy force is balanced by viscous diffusion.\n    $$ g \\beta (T - T_{core}) \\sim \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} $$\n    Scaling this equation with $\\Delta T$ as the characteristic temperature difference and $w$ as the characteristic vertical velocity:\n    $$ g \\beta \\Delta T \\sim \\nu \\frac{w}{\\delta^2} \\quad \\implies \\quad w \\sim \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta^2}{\\nu} \\quad (\\text{Eq. 1})$$\n2.  **Energy Balance**: Streamwise advection is balanced by cross-layer thermal diffusion.\n    $$ w \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} $$\n    Scaling this equation:\n    $$ w \\frac{\\Delta T}{L} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta^2} \\quad \\implies \\quad w \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta^2} \\quad (\\text{Eq. 2}) $$\n\nWe now have two expressions for the characteristic velocity $w$. Equating them allows us to solve for the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$:\n$$ \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta^2}{\\nu} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta^2} $$\n$$ \\delta^4 \\sim \\frac{\\nu \\alpha L}{g \\beta \\Delta T} $$\nTo express this in dimensionless form, we divide by $L^4$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{L}\\right)^4 \\sim \\frac{\\nu \\alpha}{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Ra}} $$\nThis gives the scaling for the boundary layer thickness:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta}{L} \\sim \\mathrm{Ra}^{-1/4} $$\nThe average Nusselt number $\\mathrm{Nu}$ is the ratio of the total heat flux to the purely conductive heat flux:\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu} = \\frac{\\langle q_{wall} \\rangle}{q_{cond}} = \\frac{\\langle -k (\\partial T / \\partial x)|_{wall} \\rangle}{k \\Delta T / L} $$\nThe temperature gradient at the wall scales as $\\Delta T / \\delta$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu} \\sim \\frac{k (\\Delta T / \\delta)}{k (\\Delta T / L)} = \\frac{L}{\\delta} $$\nSubstituting our result for $\\delta/L$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu} \\sim \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{L}\\right)^{-1} \\sim (\\mathrm{Ra}^{-1/4})^{-1} = \\mathrm{Ra}^{1/4} $$\nComparing this to the proposed form $\\mathrm{Nu} = C \\mathrm{Ra}^{a} \\mathrm{Pr}^{b}$, we find:\n$$ a = \\frac{1}{4}, \\quad b = 0 $$\n\n### Part 3: Data Fitting and Prediction\n\nBased on the scaling analysis, the model for the Nusselt number is $\\mathrm{Nu} = C \\mathrm{Ra}^{1/4}$. We need to determine the constant $C$ from the provided experimental data. The problem asks for an unbiased least-squares fit in logarithmic space.\nTaking the natural logarithm of the model equation:\n$$ \\ln(\\mathrm{Nu}) = \\ln(C) + \\frac{1}{4} \\ln(\\mathrm{Ra}) $$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\ln(C) = \\ln(\\mathrm{Nu}) - \\frac{1}{4} \\ln(\\mathrm{Ra}) $$\nWe have two data points $(\\mathrm{Ra}_i, \\mathrm{Nu}_i)$ for $i=1, 2$. Let $y_i = \\ln(\\mathrm{Nu}_i)$ and $x_i = \\ln(\\mathrm{Ra}_i)$. We are fitting the model $y_i - \\frac{1}{4} x_i = \\beta_0$, where $\\beta_0 = \\ln(C)$. The least-squares estimate for the constant $\\beta_0$ is the arithmetic mean of the observed values.\n$$ \\ln(C) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\ln(\\mathrm{Nu}_1) - \\frac{1}{4}\\ln(\\mathrm{Ra}_1)\\right) + \\left(\\ln(\\mathrm{Nu}_2) - \\frac{1}{4}\\ln(\\mathrm{Ra}_2)\\right) \\right] $$\nUsing the given data:\n- Point 1: $\\mathrm{Ra}_1 = 1.00 \\times 10^5$, $\\mathrm{Nu}_1 = 3.200$.\n- Point 2: $\\mathrm{Ra}_2 = 1.00 \\times 10^6$, $\\mathrm{Nu}_2 = 5.700$.\n\nLet's calculate the value of $C$ implied by each point.\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_1}{\\mathrm{Ra}_1^{1/4}} = \\frac{3.200}{(10^5)^{1/4}} = \\frac{3.200}{10^{5/4}} $$\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_2}{\\mathrm{Ra}_2^{1/4}} = \\frac{5.700}{(10^6)^{1/4}} = \\frac{5.700}{10^{6/4}} = \\frac{5.700}{10^{3/2}} $$\nThe best-fit value for $C$ is the geometric mean of $C_1$ and $C_2$, which is equivalent to averaging $\\ln(C)$ values.\n$$ C = \\sqrt{C_1 C_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.200}{10^{1.25}} \\cdot \\frac{5.700}{10^{1.5}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.200 \\times 5.700}{10^{1.25 + 1.5}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{18.24}{10^{2.75}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{18.24}}{10^{1.375}} $$\nNow we use this fitted model to predict $\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{pred},3}$ at $\\mathrm{Ra}_3 = 2.50 \\times 10^6$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{pred},3} = C \\cdot \\mathrm{Ra}_3^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{18.24}}{10^{1.375}}\\right) \\cdot (2.50 \\times 10^6)^{1/4} $$\nLet's simplify this expression:\n$$ (2.50 \\times 10^6)^{1/4} = (25.0 \\times 10^5)^{1/4} = (25.0)^{1/4} \\cdot (10^5)^{1/4} = \\sqrt{5} \\cdot 10^{5/4} = \\sqrt{5} \\cdot 10^{1.25} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{pred},3}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{pred},3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{18.24}}{10^{1.375}} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\cdot 10^{1.25} = \\sqrt{18.24 \\times 5} \\cdot 10^{1.25 - 1.375} = \\sqrt{91.2} \\cdot 10^{-0.125} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{pred},3} = \\sqrt{91.2} \\cdot 10^{-1/8} $$\nNow we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ \\sqrt{91.2} \\approx 9.5498691 $$\n$$ 10^{-1/8} \\approx 0.7498942 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{pred},3} \\approx 9.5498691 \\times 0.7498942 \\approx 7.16138 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{pred},3} \\approx 7.161 $$",
