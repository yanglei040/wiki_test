## Introduction
For centuries, classical [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125) has been the bedrock for understanding how materials deform. Yet, this powerful theory faces a fundamental paradox: its core mathematical tools—spatial derivatives—break down at the very point of [material failure](@entry_id:160997), a crack. This breakdown not only creates theoretical singularities but also leads to practical problems in computer simulations, such as [pathological mesh dependence](@entry_id:183356), where results change with computational grid size. How can we build a theory that embraces fracture not as a mathematical failure, but as a natural outcome?

This article introduces **[peridynamics](@entry_id:191791)**, a revolutionary nonlocal continuum theory that reformulates the principles of mechanics to elegantly handle discontinuities. By replacing spatial derivatives with integrals over a finite neighborhood, [peridynamics](@entry_id:191791) provides a robust framework for simulating the initiation and propagation of complex fracture networks from first principles.

This exploration is divided into three key sections. First, in **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will delve into the fundamental shift from local to nonlocal forces, examining the integral equation of motion and the evolution from simple bond-based models to powerful state-based formulations. Next, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will showcase the theory's versatility, from creating advanced [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726) for plasticity and [viscoelasticity](@entry_id:148045) to its role in complex multiphysics simulations involving thermal, chemical, and fluid interactions. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will offer a chance to engage directly with the core concepts through guided computational exercises. Let us begin by examining the crack in the foundation of the classical world and how [peridynamics](@entry_id:191791) offers a way to mend it.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### A Crack in the Classical World

For centuries, our understanding of how solid objects deform and break has been built upon a beautiful mathematical edifice: the theory of [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125). At its heart is the idea of stress, a measure of the internal forces that neighboring particles of a continuous material exert on each other. To find the [net force](@entry_id:163825) on a tiny cube of material, we look at how the stress changes from one face to the opposite. This change, this *gradient*, is expressed using spatial derivatives, leading to the familiar equation of motion, $\rho \ddot{\boldsymbol{u}} = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \boldsymbol{b}$, where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the stress tensor.

This theory has been fantastically successful. It helps us build bridges, design aircraft, and understand the slow crawl of tectonic plates. But it has a deep, philosophical crack in its own foundation. What happens when a material *actually* cracks? A crack is a sharp discontinuity—a jump in the displacement field $\boldsymbol{u}$. What is the derivative of a jump? It's infinite. At the very moment a crack forms, the quantities at the core of our theory become singular, and the equations break down. Classical mechanics, in a sense, is forbidden from describing the very process of its own failure.

Engineers, being practical people, have developed brilliant workarounds: theories like [fracture mechanics](@entry_id:141480) that graft special rules onto the classical framework to handle cracks. But isn't it unsettling? It's like having a theory of biology that works perfectly for healthy animals but ceases to apply the moment one gets sick. What if we could build a theory from the ground up that doesn't fear discontinuities? A theory that sees the formation of a crack not as a mathematical catastrophe, but as a natural, emergent phenomenon? This is the grand ambition of **[peridynamics](@entry_id:191791)**.

The problem with local models doesn't stop at their mathematical breakdown. When we try to simulate [material failure](@entry_id:160997) on a computer using a classical "softening" model (where material stiffness degrades with damage), we run into a disaster of a different kind: the results depend on how fine our [computational mesh](@entry_id:168560) is! The simulation, seeking the path of least resistance, will localize all the damage into the smallest region it can resolve—a single row of elements. As you refine the mesh, this region gets narrower, and the total energy required to "break" the material spuriously drops to zero. This **[pathological mesh dependence](@entry_id:183356)** means the prediction is not a property of the material, but an artifact of the computer model . We need a theory with an inherent sense of scale.

### Forces at a Distance: A Return to Newton

Peridynamics invites us to take a step back and reconsider the very nature of internal forces. Instead of thinking about the nebulous "stress" acting on infinitesimal surfaces, let's return to a more Newtonian picture. Imagine a material point. It is connected to its neighbors by a web of tiny, invisible forces. It interacts directly not just with the points touching it, but with every other point within a small, finite neighborhood. This neighborhood is called the **horizon**, and its radius, $\delta$, is a fundamental material parameter that defines the length scale of nonlocality .

The total internal force on our material point is simply the sum—or, for a continuum, the *integral*—of all these pairwise forces exerted by its neighbors within the horizon. This single, simple idea changes everything. Newton's second law, mass times acceleration, now equals the integral of all these [long-range interactions](@entry_id:140725), plus any external body forces. For a point $\boldsymbol{x}$, the [equation of motion](@entry_id:264286) takes on a radically new form:

$$ \rho(\boldsymbol{x})\ddot{\boldsymbol{u}}(\boldsymbol{x},t) = \int_{\mathcal{H}_{\boldsymbol{x}}} \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}',t)-\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t), \boldsymbol{x}'-\boldsymbol{x}) \, \mathrm{d}V_{\boldsymbol{x}'} + \boldsymbol{b}(\boldsymbol{x},t) $$

Look closely at this equation. The spatial derivatives are gone. In their place is an [integral operator](@entry_id:147512). The force $\boldsymbol{f}$ depends not on gradients, but on the *relative displacement* between two points, $\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}',t)-\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$, and their initial separation, $\boldsymbol{x}'-\boldsymbol{x}$. This formulation is the heart of [peridynamics](@entry_id:191791) .

### The Unbroken Beauty of the Integral

This shift from derivatives to integrals is not just a mathematical curiosity; it is the key that unlocks the problem of fracture. An integral, by its very nature, is a "global" operation over a region. It is profoundly indifferent to the value of its integrand at a single point, or even on a surface. A crack, in three dimensions, is a two-dimensional surface. In the language of mathematics, it has a "volume measure" of zero .

This means that even if the [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) $\boldsymbol{u}$ jumps sharply across a crack, the integral in the peridynamic equation of motion remains perfectly well-defined. The theory doesn't break down. In fact, [peridynamics](@entry_id:191791) doesn't even have a special "crack" variable. A crack is simply an emergent feature of the system: a region where the bonds between material points have broken.

How do bonds break? The simplest model is a **[critical stretch](@entry_id:200184) criterion** . Imagine each pairwise bond as a tiny, elastic spring. The stretch $s$ is its fractional change in length:

$$ s = \frac{|\text{deformed length}| - |\text{initial length}|}{|\text{initial length}|} $$

We can then posit a simple law of nature for our material: if the stretch in any bond exceeds a critical value, $s_c$, that bond breaks irreversibly and can no longer carry force. As we load the material, stresses concentrate, stretches increase, and somewhere, a bond breaks. The load it was carrying is now redistributed to its neighbors, increasing their stretch. This can cause a cascade of failures. A crack is born, and it propagates on its own, following the path dictated by the evolving [force field](@entry_id:147325). The traction-free faces of the crack emerge automatically because the integral simply stops summing contributions from across the region of broken bonds. No special tracking, no ad-hoc criteria for crack growth direction—just Newton's law in its nonlocal guise.

### Building a Material from Bonds (And Its Limits)

Let's look more closely at the pairwise force $\boldsymbol{f}$. In the simplest model, called **[bond-based peridynamics](@entry_id:188457)**, we assume the force is central (acting along the line connecting the two points) and its magnitude depends only on the bond's stretch, $s$. The stiffness of this interaction is governed by a function called the **micromodulus**, $c(\boldsymbol{\xi})$, where $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ is the bond vector in the [reference state](@entry_id:151465).

For the model to be physically sensible, the micromodulus must have certain properties. For stability, the material shouldn't want to fly apart on its own, so the [strain energy](@entry_id:162699) must be positive, which requires $c(\boldsymbol{\xi}) \ge 0$. For an [isotropic material](@entry_id:204616), the stiffness shouldn't depend on direction, so $c$ can only depend on the bond length, $c(|\boldsymbol{\xi}|)$. Furthermore, for [peridynamics](@entry_id:191791) to be a true generalization of classical elasticity, it must reduce to it in the limit of very small horizon, $\delta \to 0$. This "asymptotic compatibility" imposes a fascinating constraint: the magnitude of the micromodulus must scale as $\delta^{-(d+1)}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension. This scaling ensures that the influence of the ever-shrinking neighborhood doesn't just fade away, but converges to produce a finite classical stiffness .

But this simple, elegant model holds a deep surprise. If we do the mathematics to match its strain energy to that of classical elasticity, we find an astonishing restriction. In three dimensions, this model can only represent materials with a **Poisson's ratio**, $\nu$, of exactly $\frac{1}{4}$. Always. It doesn't matter what micromodulus function $c(|\boldsymbol{\xi}|)$ you choose . Why? Because the [central force](@entry_id:160395) assumption, combined with averaging over a spherical neighborhood, inherently couples the material's response to volume change and shape change. The model cannot distinguish between them, forcing the two classical Lamé parameters to be equal, $\lambda = \mu$, which in turn fixes the Poisson's ratio. It's a beautiful example of how a simple physical assumption can have profound, unexpected macroscopic consequences. A cork, with a Poisson's ratio near zero, cannot be described by this simple model.

### Beyond Independent Bonds: The Power of States

To overcome this limitation, [peridynamics](@entry_id:191791) had to evolve. The restriction arises because each bond acts in isolation. The fix is to allow the force in one bond to depend on the deformation of all the other bonds in its neighborhood. This leads to **[state-based peridynamics](@entry_id:190841)** .

We introduce two new concepts:
-   The **deformation state**, $\underline{\mathbf{Y}}$, which is a function that collects the deformed vectors of all bonds originating from a point. It's a complete snapshot of the local deformation.
-   The **force state**, $\underline{\mathbf{T}}$, which is a function that assigns a force vector to each bond.

The constitutive law is now much more powerful: the entire force state is a function of the entire deformation state, $\underline{\mathbf{T}} = \mathcal{T}(\underline{\mathbf{Y}})$. By allowing the force in a bond to depend on, for example, the average volume change of the neighborhood, we can decouple the response to dilatation and distortion. This allows state-based models to represent materials with any arbitrary Poisson's ratio. This framework is also powerful enough to model complex phenomena like [thermo-mechanical coupling](@entry_id:176786), where thermal expansion can be naturally incorporated into the deformation state .

In the most general **non-ordinary state-based** models, the force vector in a bond is not even required to be parallel to the deformed bond itself. This allows for even richer material responses, but it comes at a price: we have to be more careful about ensuring the fundamental laws of physics are respected.

### Keeping the Physics Honest

Any physical theory, no matter how abstract, must obey certain fundamental principles.
-   **Balance of Linear Momentum:** For any piece of the material, the internal forces must cancel out. This is guaranteed if the pairwise forces obey Newton's third law: the force that $\boldsymbol{x}$ exerts on $\boldsymbol{x}'$ is equal and opposite to the force that $\boldsymbol{x}'$ exerts on $\boldsymbol{x}$. In peridynamic language, the force function must be antisymmetric: $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}') = -\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x}', \boldsymbol{x})$ .
-   **Balance of Angular Momentum:** In the absence of internal body couples, the [internal forces](@entry_id:167605) must not produce a [net torque](@entry_id:166772). In bond-based models, this is automatically satisfied because the forces are central. In non-ordinary state-based models, where forces can be non-central, this imposes an additional mathematical constraint on the force state, ensuring a nonlocal "stress" tensor remains symmetric .
-   **Frame Indifference (Objectivity):** The material laws should not depend on whether you are observing the experiment from the laboratory or from a spinning car. This means the constitutive law must relate objective measures of deformation to the forces. Mathematically, it requires the force state to transform correctly under rigid-body rotations of the observer .

### Talking to the Outside World

A [nonlocal theory](@entry_id:752667) has a quirky relationship with the world's edge. A point in the middle of a body is surrounded by neighbors in all directions. A point near a boundary, however, has its horizon truncated—some of its potential interaction partners are missing. This "surface effect" means we can't apply classical boundary conditions in the classical way .

If we want to prescribe a displacement on a boundary (a **Dirichlet condition**), it's not enough to fix the points on the geometric surface. We must control the displacement in a thin "collar" of material of thickness $\delta$ adjacent to the boundary. An alternative, and very common, approach is to create a "fictitious layer" of [ghost points](@entry_id:177889) outside the body, whose prescribed motion provides the "missing" interactions for the real points near the edge .

If we want to apply a [surface traction](@entry_id:198058) (a **Neumann condition**), we can't apply a force to a surface of zero volume. Instead, we must convert the [surface traction](@entry_id:198058) into an equivalent body force that acts over the boundary collar of thickness $\delta$. The right way to do this is to ensure the work done by this [body force](@entry_id:184443) is the same as the work that would have been done by the classical traction .

These careful treatments are essential not just for getting the right answer, but for ensuring the theory is mathematically sound. The concept of **asymptotic compatibility** requires that as we shrink the horizon ($\delta \to 0$) and refine our [computational mesh](@entry_id:168560) ($h \to 0$, with $h/\delta \to 0$), our peridynamic solution converges to the known solution of the classical theory. This guarantees that [peridynamics](@entry_id:191791) is a true generalization, containing the successful classical theory within it as a limiting case, while providing a powerful new tool to explore the rich and complex world of [material failure](@entry_id:160997) .
