A normal preload is applied by imposing a fixed total approach between the rigid bodies, after which the machine frame locks the gap so that the mean normal separation remains fixed. The initial macroscopic contact is complete and uniform, with compressive normal stress component $\\sigma_{yy}(0)$ everywhere in the block and corresponding normal contact pressure magnitude $p_0$, defined by $p_0 = -\\sigma_{yy}(0)$. The lateral sides of the block are confined by a rigid frame so that macroscopic in-plane strains are suppressed.

            "solution": "The problem requires finding the change in contact pressure on an elastic block due to a uniform temperature increase under conditions of complete kinematic confinement. We will use the theory of linear thermoelasticity for an isotropic material.\n\nThe fundamental constitutive relation connecting strain $\\epsilon_{ij}$, stress $\\sigma_{ij}$, and temperature change $\\Delta T$ for a linear, isotropic, elastic material is given by:\n$$ \\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ (1+\\nu)\\sigma_{ij} - \\nu \\delta_{ij} \\sigma_{kk} \\right] + \\alpha \\Delta T \\delta_{ij} $$\nHere, $E$ is Young's modulus, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}$ is the trace of the stress tensor (sum of normal stresses).\n\nLet's define two states:\n-   **State 1**: The initial, preloaded state at the reference temperature. Here, $\\Delta T = 0$. The normal stress is $\\sigma_{yy,1} = -p_0$.\n-   **State 2**: The final state after heating. The temperature has increased by $\\Delta T$.\n\nThe problem states that after the initial preload, the machine frame locks the gap, and the lateral sides are confined. This means the block is kinematically constrained in all three dimensions. Any change in dimension is prevented. Therefore, the strain tensor must remain constant during the heating process from State 1 to State 2.\nLet $\\Delta \\epsilon_{ij} = \\epsilon_{ij,2} - \\epsilon_{ij,1}$ be the change in the strain components. The constraints imply:\n$$ \\Delta \\epsilon_{xx} = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta \\epsilon_{yy} = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta \\epsilon_{zz} = 0 $$\nThis means that the change in strain in all three normal directions is zero.\n\nBecause the underlying theory is linear, we can apply the principle of superposition. The change in strain is related to the change in stress, $\\Delta\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ij,2} - \\sigma_{ij,1}$, and the change in temperature, $\\Delta T$.

The bodies are pressed together under a constant normal force $P$ and undergo steady sliding with coefficient of friction $\\mu$ and relative speed $v$. After sufficient time, sustained frictional heating produces a steady, spatially uniform temperature field $T$ within the near-surface regions of both bodies in the contact, with $T - T_{0} = \\Delta T$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in classical Hertzian contact theory and linear thermoelasticity, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of definitions and constraints, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It represents a solvable problem in coupled-field mechanics.\n\nWe begin by establishing the foundational relations for an axisymmetric Hertzian contact. The radius of the circular contact patch, $a$, is related to the normal load $P$, the effective radius of curvature $R^{\\ast}$, and the effective elastic modulus $E^{\\ast}$ by the Hertz formula:\n$$\na^{3} = \\frac{3 P R^{\\ast}}{4 E^{\\ast}}\n$$\nThe pressure distribution within the contact patch is ellipsoidal, given by:\n$$\np(r) = p_{\\text{max}} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the radial coordinate from the center of the contact and $p_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum pressure at the center. The maximum pressure is related to the total load and contact radius by $p_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{3P}{2\\pi a^{2}}$.\n\nAt the initial reference temperature $T_{0}$, the contact radius $a_{0}$ is determined by the initial radii of curvature $R_{1,0}$ and $R_{2,0}$ through the initial effective radius $R_{0}^{\\ast}$, where $\\frac{1}{R_{0}^{\\ast}} = \\frac{1}{R_{1,0}} + \\frac{1}{R_{2,0}}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\na_{0}^{3} = \\frac{3 P R_{0}^{\\ast}}{4 E^{\\ast}}\n$$\n\nSustained frictional heating raises the temperature of the bodies by $\\Delta T = T - T_{0}$. The problem states that the radii of curvature undergo linear thermal expansion:\n$$\nR_{i}(T) = R_{i,0}\\left(1 + \\alpha_{i}\\Delta T\\right) \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1,2\\}\n$$\nThis thermal expansion alters the geometry of the contacting surfaces. Assuming positive coefficients of thermal expansion ($\\alpha_i > 0$) and a temperature increase ($\\Delta T > 0$), each radius of curvature increases. An increase in the radius of curvature corresponds to a decrease in the surface's curvature, making the body locally \"flatter\".\n\nThe effective radius of curvature at temperature $T$, denoted $R^{\\ast}(T)$, is defined by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}(T)} = \\frac{1}{R_{1}(T)} + \\frac{1}{R_{2}(T)}\n$$\nThe change in $R^{\\ast}(T)$ directly impacts the contact radius $a(T)$ and the pressure distribution. Specifically, because the curvature $1/R_i$ of each body decreases with temperature (for $\\alpha_i, \\Delta T > 0$), the total curvature $1/R^{\\ast}(T)$ also decreases. This implies that the effective radius $R^{\\ast}(T)$ increases. From the Hertz formula $a \\propto (R^{\\ast})^{1/3}$, an increase in the effective radius $R^{\\ast}(T)$ at a constant load $P$ and modulus $E^{\\ast}$ leads to an increase in the contact radius $a(T)$.\n\nQualitatively, the physical effect is that thermal expansion makes the contact more conformal (less curved). To support the same constant load $P$, the contact area $\\pi a^{2}$ must increase. Consequently, the maximum contact pressure $p_{\\text{max}} \\propto P/a^{2}$ must decrease. The pressure distribution becomes wider and lower in amplitude.\n\nWe now proceed with the quantitative derivation of the corrected contact radius $a(T)$. At temperature $T$, the contact radius is given by:\n$$\na(T)^{3} = \\frac{3 P R^{\\ast}(T)}{4 E^{\\ast}}\n$$\nWe are given that $P$ and $E^{\\ast}$ are constant. Taking the ratio of the expressions for $a(T)^{3}$ and $a_{0}^{3}$:\n$$\n\\frac{a(T)^{3}}{a_{0}^{3}} = \\frac{R^{\\ast}(T)}{R_{0}^{\\ast}} \\implies a(T) = a_{0} \\left(\\frac{R^{\\ast}(T)}{R_{0}^{\\ast}}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nOur goal is to find a first-order expression for the ratio $R^{\\ast}(T)/R_{0}^{\\ast}$. We start with the definition of the reciprocal effective radius at temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}(T)} = \\frac{1}{R_{1,0}(1 + \\alpha_{1}\\Delta T)} + \\frac{1}{R_{2,0}(1 + \\alpha_{2}\\Delta T)}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\max\\{|\\alpha_{1}\\Delta T|, |\\alpha_{2}\\Delta T|\\} \\ll 1$.

Applying this to each term yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}(T)} \\approx \\frac{1}{R_{1,0}}(1 - \\alpha_{1}\\Delta T) + \\frac{1}{R_{2,0}}(1 - \\alpha_{2}\\Delta T)\n$$\nSeparating the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}(T)} \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{1,0}} + \\frac{1}{R_{2,0}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{R_{1,0}} + \\frac{\\alpha_{2}}{R_{2,0}}\\right)\\Delta T\n$$\nRecognizing that the first term is $1/R_{0}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}(T)} \\approx \\frac{1}{R_{0}^{\\ast}} - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{R_{1,0}} + \\frac{\\alpha_{2}}{R_{2,0}}\\right)\\Delta T\n$$\nNow, we can find the ratio $R^{\\ast}(T)/R_{0}^{\\ast}$ by first finding its inverse, $R_{0}^{\\ast}/R^{\\ast}(T)$:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{0}^{\\ast}}{R^{\\ast}(T)} \\approx R_{0}^{\\ast} \\left[ \\frac{1}{R_{0}^{\\ast}} - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{R_{1,0}} + \\frac{\\alpha_{2}}{R_{2,0}}\\right)\\Delta T \\right] = 1 - R_{0}^{\\ast}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{R_{1,0}} + \\frac{\\alpha_{2}}{R_{2,0}}\\right)\\Delta T\n$$\nThe ratio we need is the reciprocal of this expression.

To express it fully in terms of the initial radii, we substitute $R_{0}^{\\ast} = \\frac{R_{1,0}R_{2,0}}{R_{1,0} + R_{2,0}}$ into the correction term:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} R_{0}^{\\ast}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{R_{1,0}} + \\frac{\\alpha_{2}}{R_{2,0}}\\right)\\Delta T = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{R_{1,0}R_{2,0}}{R_{1,0} + R_{2,0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}R_{2,0} + \\alpha_{2}R_{1,0}}{R_{1,0}R_{2,0}}\\right) \\Delta T\n$$\nThe term $R_{1,0}R_{2,0}$ cancels, yielding a simplified correction factor:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}R_{2,0} + \\alpha_{2}R_{1,0}}{R_{1,0} + R_{2,0}}\\right) \\Delta T\n$$\nThe final first-order expression for the corrected contact radius $a(T)$ is therefore:\n$$\na(T) = a_{0} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{1}R_{2,0} + \\alpha_{2}R_{1,0}}{R_{1,0} + R_{2,0}}\\right) \\Delta T \\right]\n$$\nThis result shows that the thermal correction to the contact radius depends on a weighted average of the thermal expansion coefficients, where the weights are determined by the initial radii of curvature of the opposing bodies.",

The total thermal conductance of the interface is the sum of the parallel conductances of all $N$ microcontacts, normalized by the nominal contact area $A_0$.\n\nThe problem provides the thermal constriction resistance for a single circular contact on body $i$ as $R_{c,i} = (2 k_i a)^{-1}$. Since the two resistances are in series, the total resistance for one microcontact, $R_{c, \\text{single}}$, is:\n$$R_{c, \\text{single}} = R_{c,1} + R_{c,2} = \\frac{1}{2 k_1 a} + \\frac{1}{2 k_2 a} = \\frac{1}{2a} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\frac{1}{k_2}\\right) = \\frac{k_1 + k_2}{2a k_1 k_2}$$\nThe conductance of a single microcontact, $h_{c, \\text{single}}$, is the reciprocal of its resistance:\n$$h_{c, \\text{single}} = \\frac{1}{R_{c, \\text{single}}} = \\frac{2a k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}$$\nThe overall thermal contact conductance, $h_c$, is the total conductance of $N$ identical microcontacts distributed over the nominal area $A_0$:\n$$h_c = \\frac{N \\cdot h_{c, \\text{single}}}{A_0} = \\frac{N}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{2a k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $a$:\n$$h_c = \\frac{N}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{2 k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{W}{N \\pi H}} = \\frac{2 k_1 k_2 \\sqrt{N}}{(k_1 + k_2) A_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{W}{\\pi H}}$$\nThis concludes the derivations for the first task.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Interfacial Temperature and Friction Coefficient**\n\nThe second task is to derive a closed-form expression for the steady interfacial temperature, $T$, and the corresponding friction coefficient, $f(T)$. This requires coupling the mechanical and thermal models through an energy balance at the sliding interface.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the first law of thermodynamics applied to the interface at steady state: the rate of heat generated by friction must equal the rate of heat conducted away from the interface. On a per-unit-nominal-area basis, this balance is expressed as:\n$$q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{gen}} = q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}}$$\nThe problem provides expressions for these heat fluxes:\n1.  Frictional heat generation: $q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{gen}} = f(T) \\, p_{\\text{nom}} \\, V$, where $p_{\\text{nom}} = W/A_0$.\n2.  Heat conduction: $q^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\text{cond}} = h_c (T - T_b)$, where $T_b$ is the far-field bulk temperature.\n\nEquating these gives the governing equation for the system:\n$$f(T) \\, \\frac{W}{A_0} \\, V = h_c (T - T_b)$$\nThe friction coefficient $f(T)$ is defined by the ratio of interfacial shear strength $\\tau_s(T)$ to hardness $H$, consistent with plastic junction theory: $f(T) = \\tau_s(T)/H$. The shear strength is given to have a linear thermal softening relation:\n$$\\tau_s(T) = \\tau_0 \\left[1 - \\beta (T - T_0)\\right]$$\nwhere $T_0$ is a reference temperature and $\\beta$ is the thermal softening coefficient. Substituting these definitions into the energy balance equation gives:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_0 \\left[1 - \\beta (T - T_0)\\right]}{H} \\frac{W}{A_0} V = h_c (T - T_b)$$\nThis is an algebraic equation that is linear in the unknown temperature $T$. We can solve for $T$ by rearranging the terms. First, expand the left side:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_0 W V}{H A_0} \\left(1 - \\beta T + \\beta T_0\\right) = h_c T - h_c T_b$$\nNext, group all terms containing $T$ on one side and all constant terms on the other:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_0 W V}{H A_0} + \\frac{\\tau_0 W V \\beta T_0}{H A_0} + h_c T_b = h_c T + \\frac{\\tau_0 W V \\beta}{H A_0} T$$\nFactor out $T$:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_0 W V}{H A_0} (1 + \\beta T_0) + h_c T_b = T \\left(h_c + \\frac{\\tau_0 \\beta W V}{H A_0}\\right)$$\nFinally, solve for the steady interfacial temperature $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{\\frac{\\tau_0 W V}{H A_0} (1 + \\beta T_0) + h_c T_b}{h_c + \\frac{\\tau_0 \\beta W V}{H A_0}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $T$. All quantities on the right-hand side are given parameters or have been derived in Part 1 (namely $h_c$).\n\nOnce the steady-state temperature $T$ is calculated using this formula, the corresponding steady-state friction coefficient $f(T)$ is found by substituting this temperature back into its definition:\n$$f(T) = \\frac{\\tau_0 \\left[1 - \\beta (T - T_0)\\right]}{H}$$\nWe must enforce the physical constraint that shear strength cannot be negative, which implies the friction coefficient also cannot be negative. Therefore, if the calculated $T$ is high enough to make the term $(1 - \\beta(T-T_0))$ negative, the friction coefficient should be set to zero. This is handled by:\n$$f(T) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{\\tau_0}{H} \\left[1 - \\beta (T - T_0)\\right]\\right)$$\nThe logic for the numerical implementation will follow these derived expressions.",
