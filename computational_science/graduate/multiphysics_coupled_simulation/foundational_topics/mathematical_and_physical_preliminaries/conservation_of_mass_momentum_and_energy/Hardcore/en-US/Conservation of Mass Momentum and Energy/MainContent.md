## Introduction
The laws of [conservation of mass](@entry_id:268004), momentum, and energy are the indisputable cornerstones of physical science, governing the behavior of systems from the smallest fluid element to the largest galaxy. Their universal applicability provides a powerful and consistent foundation for modeling the world around us. However, applying these principles to the complex, coupled phenomena found in modern engineering and science requires a systematic framework that translates physical intuition into robust mathematical equations and accurate computational algorithms. This article bridges that gap, providing a comprehensive guide to the derivation, application, and numerical implementation of these fundamental laws in the context of [multiphysics](@entry_id:164478) simulations.

The reader will embark on a structured journey through this essential topic. We will begin in the **Principles and Mechanisms** chapter by deriving the core conservation laws from a general balance principle, exploring their integral and differential forms, and examining the thermodynamic and physical constraints that govern them. The subsequent **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will then showcase how this theoretical framework is extended and adapted to model a vast array of real-world phenomena, from reacting flows and [astrophysical shocks](@entry_id:184006) to battery performance and [biological transport](@entry_id:150000). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer opportunities to apply these concepts to concrete problems in computational physics. This exploration begins with a deep dive into the foundational principles that make all subsequent applications possible.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The behavior of a physical continuum, whether a fluid, solid, or plasma, is governed by a set of universal conservation laws. These laws state that certain fundamental quantities—namely mass, momentum, and energy—are conserved within any portion of the material. While the physical principles are universal, their mathematical expression and computational implementation in multiphysics simulations require a rigorous and systematic framework. This chapter establishes this framework, beginning with the integral formulation of a general balance law and progressively specializing it to the core conservation principles. We will then explore the thermodynamic constraints imposed by the second law of thermodynamics, the principles governing material behavior, and the extension of these laws to complex multiphysics systems such as multicomponent mixtures and multiphase flows. Finally, we will bridge the gap between the continuous mathematical theory and its discrete computational counterpart, exploring the requirements for ensuring conservation in numerical simulations.

### The General Balance Law in Integral Form

The cornerstone of continuum mechanics is the concept of a **balance law** for an extensive physical quantity. An extensive quantity is one that scales with the size of the system, such as mass, momentum, or energy. Let us consider an arbitrary, fixed region in space, known as a **control volume**, denoted by $V$. The boundary of this volume is $\partial V$. The general balance law for any extensive quantity can be stated in words as:

*The rate of accumulation of the quantity within the control volume is equal to the net rate at which the quantity flows into the volume across its boundary, plus the net rate at which the quantity is generated by sources within the volume.*

To formalize this, let $\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)$ represent the density (amount per unit volume) of a generic extensive quantity. The total amount of this quantity within the control volume $V$ at any time $t$ is given by the volume integral $\int_V \phi \, dV$. The rate of accumulation, or the **storage term**, is simply the time derivative of this total amount:

$$
\text{Storage Term} = \frac{d}{dt} \int_V \phi \, dV
$$

The transport of the quantity across the boundary $\partial V$ occurs through two primary mechanisms:

1.  **Convective Flux**: The quantity is carried along with the bulk motion of the continuum. If the material moves with a velocity field $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t)$, the flux associated with this transport is $\phi \mathbf{v}$.
2.  **Non-convective Flux**: The quantity can also be transported by mechanisms other than bulk motion, such as molecular diffusion, heat conduction, or the transmission of [internal forces](@entry_id:167605). We represent this transport with a generic non-[convective flux](@entry_id:158187) vector, $\mathbf{j}_\phi$.

The total [flux vector](@entry_id:273577) is therefore $\phi \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{j}_\phi$. By convention, the flux is positive for an outward flow. The net rate of outflow across the boundary $\partial V$ is given by the surface integral $\int_{\partial V} (\phi \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{j}_\phi) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS$, where $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing [unit normal vector](@entry_id:178851) on the boundary. The net rate of inflow is the negative of this value.

Finally, the quantity may be created or destroyed within the volume by various physical processes (e.g., chemical reactions, electromagnetic heating). We represent this as a volumetric **[source term](@entry_id:269111)**, $s_\phi$. The total rate of generation within $V$ is $\int_V s_\phi \, dV$.

Combining these components according to the balance principle gives the general integral balance law for a fixed (or **Eulerian**) control volume :

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_V \phi \, dV = - \int_{\partial V} (\phi \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{j}_\phi) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS + \int_V s_\phi \, dV
$$

This equation, often derived formally using the Reynolds Transport Theorem, is the starting point for deriving all fundamental conservation laws.

### The Fundamental Equations of Continuum Mechanics

The general balance law can be specialized to derive the governing equations for mass, momentum, and energy by correctly identifying the density $\phi$, non-[convective flux](@entry_id:158187) $\mathbf{j}_\phi$, and source $s_\phi$ for each conserved quantity.

#### Conservation of Mass

For the conservation of mass, the extensive quantity is mass itself. The density of mass is the mass density field, $\rho(\mathbf{x}, t)$.
-   Conserved density: $\phi = \rho$.
-   Non-[convective flux](@entry_id:158187): In a single-component continuum, mass is only transported by the bulk motion. There is no diffusion of mass relative to the center of mass. Therefore, $\mathbf{j}_\phi = \mathbf{0}$.
-   Source term: Mass is fundamentally conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed. Thus, the source term is zero: $s_\phi = 0$.

Substituting these into the general balance law yields the integral form of the **[continuity equation](@entry_id:145242)**:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_V \rho \, dV = - \int_{\partial V} \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
$$

This equation states that the rate of change of mass inside a fixed volume is equal to the net rate of mass flowing across its boundary.

#### Conservation of Linear Momentum

The [conservation of linear momentum](@entry_id:165717) is the [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125) expression of Newton's second law. The extensive quantity is [linear momentum](@entry_id:174467), and its density is the [momentum density](@entry_id:271360), $\rho \mathbf{v}$.
-   Conserved density: $\boldsymbol{\phi} = \rho \mathbf{v}$ (a vector quantity).
-   Convective flux: Momentum is convected with the flow, leading to a [convective flux](@entry_id:158187) tensor $\rho \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{v}$. The outflow across a surface with normal $\mathbf{n}$ is $(\rho \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{v})\mathbf{n} = \rho \mathbf{v} (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n})$.
-   Non-[convective flux](@entry_id:158187) and sources: According to Newton's second law, the rate of change of momentum is equal to the sum of all forces. These forces act as sources of momentum. We distinguish between:
    -   **Body forces**, such as gravity, which act on the bulk of the material. They are represented by a force per unit mass, $\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{x}, t)$, leading to a volumetric [source term](@entry_id:269111) $\rho \mathbf{b}$.
    -   **Surface forces**, which are contact forces exerted by adjacent material across a surface. According to Cauchy's stress principle, the [traction vector](@entry_id:189429) (force per unit area) $\mathbf{t}$ on a surface with normal $\mathbf{n}$ is a linear function of that normal. This relationship defines the **Cauchy stress tensor** $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, a second-order tensor, such that $\mathbf{t} = \boldsymbol{\sigma} \mathbf{n}$ . The total surface force acting on the control volume is $\int_{\partial V} \boldsymbol{\sigma} \mathbf{n} \, dS$. This term can be interpreted as a momentum source or, more consistently with the general balance law, as a result of a non-convective momentum flux. If we define the non-convective [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) tensor as $\mathbf{J}_{\rho\mathbf{v}} = -\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, then the inflow term becomes $- \int_{\partial V} (-\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \int_{\partial V} \boldsymbol{\sigma} \mathbf{n} \, dS$.

The Cauchy stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ generalizes the notion of pressure. It can be decomposed into an isotropic part, related to pressure, and a deviatoric part, related to viscous or shear stresses. For a fluid at rest, $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = -p\mathbf{I}$, where $p$ is the thermodynamic pressure and $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor. In a moving, viscous fluid, the mechanical pressure, defined as $p_m = -\frac{1}{3}\operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$, is not generally equal to the thermodynamic pressure $p$ due to effects like bulk viscosity .

Combining these terms gives the integral form of the **[momentum conservation](@entry_id:149964) equation** :

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_V \rho \mathbf{v} \, dV = - \int_{\partial V} \rho \mathbf{v} (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dS + \int_{\partial V} \boldsymbol{\sigma} \mathbf{n} \, dS + \int_V \rho \mathbf{b} \, dV
$$

#### Conservation of Energy

The conservation of energy is the continuum expression of the First Law of Thermodynamics. It states that the rate of change of the total energy in a volume equals the rate of work done on the volume plus the rate of heat added to it. The total energy density is $\rho E_{tot}$, where $E_{tot} = e + \frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{v}|^2$ is the specific total energy, comprising the specific internal energy $e$ and specific kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{v}|^2$.
-   Conserved density: $\phi = \rho E_{tot}$.
-   Fluxes and Sources:
    -   Energy is convected with the flow, giving a [convective flux](@entry_id:158187) $\rho E_{tot} \mathbf{v}$.
    -   Heat is transferred by conduction, represented by the **heat flux vector** $\mathbf{q}$. By convention, $\mathbf{q}$ points in the direction of heat flow, so $-\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n}$ is the rate of heat entering across a surface. This corresponds to a non-convective energy flux term $\mathbf{q}$.
    -   Surface forces do work. The rate of work done by the surroundings on the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) at its boundary is $\int_{\partial V} (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \mathbf{n}) \cdot \mathbf{v} \, dS$. This is an energy inflow, corresponding to a non-convective energy flux of $-\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{v}$.
    -   Body forces do work at a rate of $\int_V (\rho \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{v} \, dV$. This is a volumetric energy [source term](@entry_id:269111), $\rho \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{v}$.
    -   There may be other volumetric heat sources, such as Joule heating or radiation absorption, represented by a [source term](@entry_id:269111) $r$.

Combining these identifies the total non-convective [energy flux](@entry_id:266056) as $\mathbf{j}_E = \mathbf{q} - \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{v}$ and the total volumetric source as $s_E = \rho \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{v} + r$. The integral form of the **total [energy conservation equation](@entry_id:748978)** is then :

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_V \rho E_{tot} \, dV = - \int_{\partial V} (\rho E_{tot} \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{q} - \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS + \int_V (\rho \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{v} + r) \, dV
$$

#### Local Differential Forms and the Material Derivative

The integral balance laws apply to finite volumes. For many analytical and computational purposes, it is useful to have local, differential forms of these equations that apply at every point in the continuum. Assuming the fields are sufficiently smooth, the **Divergence Theorem** allows us to convert the [surface integrals](@entry_id:144805) into [volume integrals](@entry_id:183482) (e.g., $\int_{\partial V} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV$). Applying this to the general balance law gives:

$$
\int_V \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \, dV = \int_V [ - \nabla \cdot (\phi \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{j}_\phi) + s_\phi ] \, dV
$$

Since this must hold for any arbitrary [control volume](@entry_id:143882) $V$, the integrands must be equal, yielding the general conservation law in differential form:

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\phi \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{j}_\phi) = s_\phi
$$

A key concept in this context is the **[material derivative](@entry_id:266939)**, denoted $D/Dt$. It represents the rate of change of a property for an observer following a material particle. It relates to the fixed-point (Eulerian) time derivative $\partial / \partial t$ via the [chain rule](@entry_id:147422):

$$
\frac{D\phi}{Dt} = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \phi
$$

Using this definition and the [product rule](@entry_id:144424), the general conservation law can be rewritten in a "non-conservative" form involving the [material derivative](@entry_id:266939). For example, the local form of the total [energy balance](@entry_id:150831), after applying the divergence theorem, is :

$$
\rho \frac{DE_{tot}}{Dt} = \nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{v}) - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} + \rho \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{v} + r
$$

### The Second Law and Thermodynamic Consistency

The conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy (the First Law of Thermodynamics) describe the balance of these quantities. However, they do not restrict the direction of physical processes. For instance, the first law allows heat to flow from a cold body to a hot body, a process never observed in nature. The **Second Law of Thermodynamics** provides this directional constraint by postulating that the total entropy of an [isolated system](@entry_id:142067) can never decrease.

In [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125), this principle is expressed locally by the **Clausius-Duhem inequality**. It states that the rate of entropy production must be non-negative. Let $s$ be the specific entropy (entropy per unit mass). The local entropy balance is postulated as an inequality:

$$
\rho \frac{Ds}{Dt} \ge -\nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\mathbf{q}}{\theta}\right) + \frac{\rho r}{\theta}
$$

where $\theta$ is the [absolute temperature](@entry_id:144687). The term $\mathbf{q}/\theta$ is the entropy flux. The inequality allows for irreversible [entropy generation](@entry_id:138799) within the material. By using the [energy equation](@entry_id:156281) to eliminate the external heat supply $r$, we can derive a form of the inequality that constrains the material's internal constitution :

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma} : \mathbf{D} - \rho\left(\frac{De}{Dt} - \theta \frac{Ds}{Dt}\right) - \frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{q} \cdot \nabla \theta \ge 0
$$

where $\mathbf{D}$ is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient, $\nabla \mathbf{v}$. This inequality is profoundly important. It separates the power supplied to the material into reversible and irreversible parts. By introducing the **Helmholtz free energy**, $\psi = e - \theta s$, the inequality can be rewritten as:

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma} : \mathbf{D} - \rho(\dot{\psi} + s\dot{\theta}) - \frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{q} \cdot \nabla \theta \ge 0
$$

The entire left-hand side is the **dissipation**, which must be non-negative. The term $-\frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{q} \cdot \nabla \theta$ represents dissipation due to heat conduction (since heat $\mathbf{q}$ flows down a temperature gradient, this term is non-negative). The remaining terms, $\boldsymbol{\sigma} : \mathbf{D} - \rho(\dot{\psi} + s\dot{\theta})$, represent [mechanical dissipation](@entry_id:169843). For a purely elastic material, this term is zero, which leads to [constitutive relations](@entry_id:186508) for stress and entropy. For a viscous fluid or plastic solid, this term is positive and represents energy converted irreversibly into heat.

### The Principle of Material Frame-Indifference

The conservation laws are universal, but to solve them, one must supply **[constitutive relations](@entry_id:186508)** that describe how a specific material behaves (e.g., how stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ relates to deformation, or how heat flux $\mathbf{q}$ relates to temperature gradient). A fundamental principle governing all constitutive laws is **[material frame-indifference](@entry_id:178419)**, or **objectivity**.

This principle states that the response of a material cannot depend on the observer. More precisely, constitutive laws must have the same form for all observers, including those undergoing arbitrary time-dependent rigid-body motions (translations and rotations). This is a stricter requirement than **Galilean invariance**, which only requires invariance of physical laws between *inertial* frames (those moving at a [constant velocity](@entry_id:170682) relative to one another) .

-   **Momentum Balance:** Newton's second law, and thus the [momentum conservation](@entry_id:149964) equation, is Galilean invariant but **not** objective. In a non-inertial (e.g., rotating) frame, the equation's form changes with the appearance of [inertial forces](@entry_id:169104) (like Coriolis and centrifugal forces).
-   **Constitutive Laws:** Because material response is an [intrinsic property](@entry_id:273674), it must not depend on the observer's motion. Therefore, [constitutive relations](@entry_id:186508) for quantities like stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and heat flux $\mathbf{q}$ must be objective. This means they can only relate objective quantities. For example, a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is objective if it transforms as $\mathbf{v}' = \mathbf{Q}\mathbf{v}$ under a rotation $\mathbf{Q}$, and a tensor $\mathbf{T}$ is objective if it transforms as $\mathbf{T}' = \mathbf{Q}\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Q}^T$.
-   **Energy Balance:** The total energy density $E_{tot} = e + \frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{v}|^2$ is not objective because kinetic energy is observer-dependent. However, the internal [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) can be shown to be objective, which is essential because it is this balance that is directly linked to the constitutive laws via the Clausius-Duhem inequality.

This principle places severe restrictions on the allowable forms of [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726), ensuring they are physically realistic.

### Extensions to Complex Multiphysics Systems

The fundamental conservation laws can be extended to describe more complex systems commonly encountered in multiphysics simulations.

#### Multicomponent Systems

When a continuum consists of a mixture of multiple chemical species, we must track the mass of each species. The principle of mass conservation is applied to each species $k$ individually. We define the **mass fraction** $Y_k = \rho_k / \rho$, where $\rho_k$ is the partial density of species $k$ and $\rho$ is the total mixture density. By definition, $\sum_{k=1}^{N} Y_k = 1$.

The velocity of species $k$, $\mathbf{v}_k$, may differ from the mixture's mass-averaged (barycentric) velocity $\mathbf{v}$. This relative motion is diffusion. The **diffusion velocity** is $V_k = \mathbf{v}_k - \mathbf{v}$, and the **diffusive mass flux** of species $k$ is defined as $\mathbf{J}_k = \rho_k V_k$. By definition of the [mass-averaged velocity](@entry_id:149575), it is a fundamental constraint that the sum of all diffusive mass fluxes is zero: $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{J}_k = \mathbf{0}$ .

The conservation equation for species $k$, including a chemical reaction [source term](@entry_id:269111) $\dot{\omega}_k$, can be written in a form that clearly shows the roles of convection with the mixture velocity and diffusion relative to it:

$$
\frac{\partial (\rho Y_k)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho Y_k \mathbf{v}) = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_k + \dot{\omega}_k
$$

Summing this equation over all species and using the constraints $\sum Y_k=1$, $\sum \mathbf{J}_k = \mathbf{0}$, and conservation of mass in reactions $\sum \dot{\omega}_k = 0$, recovers the total mass continuity equation. This consistency is crucial for [coupled transport](@entry_id:144035) simulations.

#### Multiphase Systems

Many systems involve multiple immiscible phases (e.g., liquid-gas, solid-liquid). Two main approaches exist for modeling such systems.

**1. Averaged Models:** When the phases are finely intermingled, it is computationally prohibitive to resolve every interface. Instead, we use an averaging procedure (e.g., volume averaging) over a [representative volume element](@entry_id:164290). This leads to models where each point in space is characterized by the presence of all phases, weighted by their **volume fraction** $\alpha_i$ (where $\sum_i \alpha_i = 1$). Each phase $i$ has its own averaged velocity $\mathbf{v}_i$ and density $\rho_i$. The balance laws are written for each phase individually, but now include **interfacial transfer terms** that account for the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between the phases . For example, the mass balance for phase $i$ becomes:

$$
\frac{\partial (\alpha_i \rho_i)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\alpha_i \rho_i \mathbf{v}_i) = \Gamma_i
$$

where $\Gamma_i$ is the rate of [mass transfer](@entry_id:151080) into phase $i$ (e.g., from [evaporation](@entry_id:137264)). These internal exchange terms must respect the conservation laws for the mixture as a whole. For instance, since mass is only exchanged between phases, $\sum_i \Gamma_i = 0$. Similarly, the sum of all interfacial momentum and energy exchange terms must be zero, as they represent internal actions and reactions.

**2. Sharp Interface Models:** When the phases are separated by distinct, resolvable interfaces, a different approach is used. The standard conservation laws apply within the bulk of each phase. Across the interface, which is treated as a [surface of discontinuity](@entry_id:180188), the conservation laws take the form of **jump conditions**. These conditions relate the fields on one side of the interface to the fields on the other side.

For a sharp interface moving with normal velocity $s\mathbf{n}$ (where $\mathbf{n}$ points from side $-$ to side $+$), the mass balance across the interface can be derived by applying the Reynolds Transport Theorem to a vanishingly small "pillbox" [control volume](@entry_id:143882) straddling the interface. This yields the **Rankine-Hugoniot [jump condition](@entry_id:176163) for mass** :

$$
[\rho (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} - s)] = 0 \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad s[\rho] = [\rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}]
$$

Here, the bracket notation $[A]$ denotes the jump $A^+ - A^-$. The term $\rho(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n} - s)$ is the mass flux relative to the moving interface, and the condition states that this flux must be continuous. Similar jump conditions are derived for momentum and energy, which form the basis for [interface tracking](@entry_id:750734) and capturing methods in multiphysics simulations.

### From Continuous Equations to Discrete Conservation

Translating the continuous conservation laws into a computational algorithm that respects them is a non-trivial task. A numerical method is said to be **conservative** if its discrete equations maintain a discrete analogue of the integral balance law. This ensures that the conserved quantities are not artificially created or destroyed by the numerical scheme.

The **weak form** of a conservation law is a crucial intermediate step. It is derived by multiplying the differential equation by a **test function** $\varphi$ and integrating over the domain. Integration by parts is used to transfer derivatives from the solution variables to the smooth test function. This process naturally gives rise to boundary integral terms involving fluxes, which is the key to enforcing flux continuity in a numerically stable way .

Different [discretization methods](@entry_id:272547) have different conservation properties:
-   **Finite Volume Method (FVM):** This method is designed from the ground up to be conservative. It discretizes the integral form of the conservation law directly on a set of control volumes (cells). By ensuring that the numerical flux leaving one cell is exactly equal to the flux entering the adjacent cell, global conservation is guaranteed by construction.
-   **Continuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (CG-FEM):** Standard CG-FEM, while excellent for many problems, is generally *not* locally conservative. It enforces the weak form of the equation but does not enforce a strict [flux balance](@entry_id:274729) at the boundaries between elements.

For simulations involving moving or deforming domains, the **Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)** framework is essential. In ALE, the computational mesh is allowed to move with a grid velocity $\mathbf{w}$, which can be chosen arbitrarily—fixed in space (Eulerian, $\mathbf{w}=0$), moving with the material (Lagrangian, $\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{v}$), or adapted to the problem geometry. A key relation in ALE is the connection between the time derivative at a fixed reference coordinate $\mathbf{X}$ (the ALE derivative) and the time derivative at a fixed spatial point $\mathbf{x}$ :

$$
\left.\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\right|_{\mathbf{X}} = \left.\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\right|_{\mathbf{x}} + \mathbf{w} \cdot \nabla \phi
$$

To maintain conservation in a [finite volume method](@entry_id:141374) on a [moving mesh](@entry_id:752196), the flux across a moving cell face must be corrected for the motion of the face itself. The correct flux to use is the ALE flux, $(\mathbf{f} - u\mathbf{w})\cdot\mathbf{n}$, where $u$ is the conserved quantity density .

Finally, it is critical to discretize the correct *form* of the equation. For example, the momentum equation can be written in [conservative form](@entry_id:747710) in terms of momentum density $\rho\mathbf{v}$, or in non-conservative (advective) form in terms of velocity $\mathbf{v}$. While analytically equivalent (assuming mass is conserved), their discrete versions are not. Discretizing the [non-conservative form](@entry_id:752551) can lead to schemes that do not conserve momentum, producing significant errors, especially in flows with variable density or shocks. Ensuring conservation of fundamental quantities requires discretizing the equations in their proper **conservative, [divergence form](@entry_id:748608)** .
