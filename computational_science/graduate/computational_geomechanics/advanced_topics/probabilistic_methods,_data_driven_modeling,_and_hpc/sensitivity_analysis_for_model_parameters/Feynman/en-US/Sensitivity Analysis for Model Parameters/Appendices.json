We begin with a foundational exercise using an analytical approach. This practice explores the celebrated Modified Cam-Clay model, a cornerstone of critical state soil mechanics, to determine how the predicted peak shear strength responds to changes in the critical state line slope, $M$, and the preconsolidation pressure, $p_c$ . By deriving these sensitivities directly from the model's yield surface equation, you will gain a first-hand appreciation for how parameter perturbations influence key engineering quantities.",

            "problem": "Consider a normally consolidated clay modeled with the Modified Cam–Clay (MCC) constitutive model in effective stresses under axisymmetric drained triaxial compression with small strain increments. Let the mean effective stress be defined as $p = (\\sigma_{1}^{\\prime} + 2 \\sigma_{3}^{\\prime})/3$ and the deviatoric stress be defined as $q = \\sqrt{3 J_{2}}$, which under axisymmetry equals $q = \\sigma_{1}^{\\prime} - \\sigma_{3}^{\\prime}$. The MCC yield surface in the $p$–$q$ plane is given by\n$$\nf(p,q; M,p_{c}) = q^{2} + M^{2} p \\left(p - p_{c}\\right) = 0,\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the slope of the critical state line in the $p$–$q$ plane, and $p_{c}$ is the current hardening parameter (also called the preconsolidation pressure).

The definitions of stress invariants $p$ and $q$ are standard. The mathematical objective is to find the maximum of a function and its derivatives, which is a well-posed problem. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the peak deviatoric stress, $q_{\\text{peak}}$, that can be sustained on a given Modified Cam-Clay (MCC) yield surface, and then to find the sensitivities of this peak stress with respect to the model parameters $M$ and $p_{c}$.\n\nThe MCC yield surface is given by the equation:\n$$q^{2} + M^{2} p (p - p_{c}) = 0$$\nwhere $q$ is the deviatoric stress, $p$ is the mean effective stress, $M$ is the slope of the critical state line, and $p_{c}$ is the preconsolidation pressure. The parameters $M$ and $p_{c}$ define the size and shape of the yield surface for a given state of the soil. Since $q$, $M$, and $p_{c}$ are non-negative physical quantities, any valid stress state must also have $p \\ge 0$. For $q^2$ to be non-negative, the term $M^2 p(p-p_c)$ must be non-positive. As $M^2 \\ge 0$ and $p \\ge 0$, this requires $p - p_c \\le 0$, which implies that a stress state on the yield surface must satisfy $0 \\le p \\le p_c$.\n\nTo find the peak deviatoric stress, $q_{\\text{peak}}$, we must find the maximum value of $q$ on this yield surface. We can express $q^{2}$ as a function of $p$:\n$$q^{2}(p) = -M^{2} p (p - p_{c}) = M^{2} (p_{c} p - p^{2})$$\nSince $q$ must be non-negative, maximizing $q$ is equivalent to maximizing $q^{2}$. We can find the value of $p$ at which this maximum occurs by setting the derivative of $q^{2}$ with respect to $p$ equal to zero. This is the optimization condition.\n$$\\frac{d(q^{2})}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left[ M^{2} (p_{c} p - p^{2}) \\right] = 0$$\nPerforming the differentiation:\n$$M^{2} (p_{c} - 2p) = 0$$\nFor a non-trivial material ($M \\neq 0$), the condition for the maximum is:\n$$p_{c} - 2p = 0$$\nThis gives the mean effective stress at which the peak deviatoric stress occurs:\n$$p_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{p_{c}}{2}$$\nThis optimization condition, $\\frac{dq}{dp} = 0$, geometrically identifies the highest point (vertex) of the elliptical yield surface in the $p$-$q$ plane. Physically, in the context of a drained triaxial test on a normally consolidated clay sample, the stress path would evolve, hit the yield surface, and then cause plastic deformation. The quantity $q_{\\text{peak}}$ represents the maximum shear stress the material can sustain for a given level of consolidation, represented by $p_{c}$, before it might soften or harden towards the critical state. It is a fundamental measure of the strength defined by the current yield locus.\n\nNow, we substitute $p_{\\text{peak}} = p_{c}/2$ back into the expression for $q^{2}$ to find the value of $q_{\\textpeak}}^{2}$:\n$$q_{\\text{peak}}^{2} = M^{2} \\left[ p_{c} \\left(\\frac{p_{c}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{p_{c}}{2}\\right)^{2} \\right]$$\n$$q_{\\textpeak}}^{2} = M^{2} \\left( \\frac{p_{c}^{2}}{2} - \\frac{p_{c}^{2}}{4} \\right) = M^{2} \\left( \\frac{p_{c}^{2}}{4} \\right)$$\nTaking the positive square root (since $q$, $M$, and $p_{c}$ are non-negative), we obtain the expression for the peak deviatoric stress:\n$$q_{\\text{peak}}(M, p_{c}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{M^{2}p_{c}^{2}}{4}} = \\frac{M p_{c}}{2}$$\nWith this closed-form expression for $q_{\\text{peak}}$, we can now compute its sensitivities by taking the partial derivatives with respect to $M$ and $p_{c}$.\n\nThe sensitivity with respect to the critical state line slope, $M$, is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial q_{\\text{peak}}}{\\partial M} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M} \\left( \\frac{M p_{c}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{p_{c}}{2}$$\nPhysically, this indicates that for a fixed consolidation pressure $p_{c}$, the peak strength increases linearly with $p_{c}/2$ as $M$ increases. The parameter $M$ controls the \"height\" of the yield ellipse, so a larger $M$ leads to a proportionally higher peak.\n\nThe sensitivity with respect to the preconsolidation pressure, $p_{c}$, is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial q_{\\text{peak}}}{\\partial p_{c}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{c}} \\left( \\frac{M p_{c}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{M}{2}$$\nThis result shows that for a fixed material type (constant $M$), the peak strength increases linearly with $M/2$ as the consolidation pressure $p_{c}$ increases. The parameter $p_c$ controls the \"size\" of the yield ellipse, so a larger $p_c$ expands the ellipse, leading to a higher peak.\n\nThe problem asks for the final sensitivities to be reported as a single row matrix $\\left(\\partial q_{\\textpeak}/\\partial M, \\partial q_{\\text{peak}}/\\partial p_{c}\\right)$. Assembling our results, we get:\n$$\\left( \\frac{p_{c}}{2}, \\frac{M}{2} \\right)$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the sensitivity of the updated axial stress component, $\\sigma_{11}^{n+1}$, with respect to the initial yield stress, $\\sigma_{y0}$, for a $J_2$ plasticity model with linear isotropic hardening. The derivation must start from the fundamental principles of the radial return algorithm.\n\nFirst, we establish the constitutive framework for an isotropic, associative $J_2$ plasticity model. The total stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is decomposed into its volumetric and deviatoric parts: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = p\\mathbf{I} + \\mathbf{s}$, where $p = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ is the mean stress and $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathrm{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ is the deviatoric stress.\n\nThe elastic behavior is governed by Hooke's law. The elastic constants are Young's modulus, $E = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, and Poisson's ratio, $\\nu = 0.3$. From these, we derive the shear modulus $G$:\n$$G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$$\nThe bulk modulus $K$ governs the volumetric response: $p = K \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^\\mathrm{e})$.\n\nThe yield condition is defined by the von Mises yield function, $f$:\n$$f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\kappa) = \\sigma_e(\\mathbf{s}) - \\sigma_y(\\kappa) = 0$$\nwhere $\\sigma_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\mathbf{s}:\\mathbf{s}}$ is the von Mises equivalent stress, and $\\sigma_y(\\kappa)$ is the current yield stress, which depends on the accumulated plastic strain, $\\kappa$.\nThe given linear isotropic hardening law is:\n$$\\sigma_y(\\kappa) = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\kappa$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{y0} = 25\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ is the initial yield stress and $H = 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ is the hardening modulus.\n\nThe radial return mapping algorithm proceeds in two steps: an elastic predictor and a plastic corrector.\n1.  **Elastic Predictor:** A trial stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$, is computed assuming the entire strain increment from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$ is elastic. The problem provides this trial stress:\n    $$\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\mathrm{diag}(60, 0, 0)\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$$\n    The trial mean stress is $p^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}}) = \\frac{1}{3}(60) = 20\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n    The trial deviatoric stress is $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - p^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathrm{diag}(60, 0, 0) - \\mathrm{diag}(20, 20, 20) = \\mathrm{diag}(40, -20, -20)\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n    The trial equivalent stress is $\\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}:\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}(40^2 + (-20)^2 + (-20)^2)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}(2400)} = 60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n    The yield stress at the start of the step is $\\sigma_y(\\kappa_n) = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\kappa_n = 25 + 10(0.02) = 25.2\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n    The trial yield condition is $f^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\sigma_y(\\kappa_n) = 60 - 25.2 = 34.8\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. Since $f^{\\mathrm{tr}} > 0$, plastic flow occurs, as stated in the problem.\n\n2.  **Plastic Corrector:** The trial stress is returned to the updated yield surface. The update equations are:\n    The updated stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}$ is related to the trial stress by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\mathbf{C}^\\mathrm{e}:\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^\\mathrm{p}$, where $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^\\mathrm{p}$ is the plastic strain increment. For isotropic elasticity, this separates into volumetric and deviatoric parts. For $J_2$ plasticity, plastic flow is isochoric, so $\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^\\mathrm{p}) = 0$. This implies the mean stress is unchanged from the trial state:\n    $$p_{n+1} = p^{\\mathrm{tr}}$$\n    The deviatoric stress update is:\n    $$\\mathbf{s}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 2G\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^\\mathrm{p}$$\n    The associative flow rule states that the plastic strain increment is normal to the yield surface:\n    $$\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^\\mathrm{p} = \\Delta\\gamma \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}} = \\Delta\\gamma \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_e}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}} = \\Delta\\gamma \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{e}(\\mathbf{s}_{n+1})}$$\n    where $\\Delta\\gamma$ is the consistency parameter (plastic multiplier). Substituting the flow rule into the stress update:\n    $$\\mathbf{s}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 2G\\left(\\Delta\\gamma \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{e,n+1}}\\right) = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 3G\\Delta\\gamma\\frac{\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}}{\\sigma_{e,n+1}}$$\n    Rearranging for $\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}$:\n    $$\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}\\left(1 + \\frac{3G\\Delta\\gamma}{\\sigma_{e,n+1}}\\right) = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$$\n    This shows that $\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}$ is co-directional with $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$. The plastic consistency condition requires $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}, \\kappa_{n+1}) = 0$, which means $\\sigma_{e,n+1} = \\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})$. Using this, we can write:\n    $$\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}\\left(1 + \\frac{3G\\Delta\\gamma}{\\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})}\\right) = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$$\n    Taking the equivalent stress of both sides gives:\n    $$\\sigma_{e,n+1}\\left(1 + \\frac{3G\\Delta\\gamma}{\\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})}\\right) = \\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}$$\n    Substituting $\\sigma_{e,n+1} = \\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})$ again:\n    $$\\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1}) + 3G\\Delta\\gamma = \\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}$$\n    The accumulated plastic strain is updated as $\\kappa_{n+1} = \\kappa_n + \\Delta\\kappa$. For the chosen definition of equivalent plastic strain rate, $\\dot{\\kappa} = \\dot{\\gamma}$, so $\\Delta\\kappa = \\Delta\\gamma$. The hardening law becomes $\\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1}) = \\sigma_{y0} + H(\\kappa_n + \\Delta\\gamma)$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives the discrete consistency equation for $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n    $$(\\sigma_{y0} + H(\\kappa_n + \\Delta\\gamma)) + 3G\\Delta\\gamma = \\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}$$\n    Let's define a residual function $R(\\Delta\\gamma, \\sigma_{y0}) = \\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}} - \\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1}) - 3G\\Delta\\gamma = 0$. This is the implicit equation governing the plastic update.\n\nWe need to compute the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{11}^{n+1}}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}}$. The updated stress component is $\\sigma_{11}^{n+1} = s_{11}^{n+1} + p_{n+1}$. Since $p_{n+1} = p^{\\mathrm{tr}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$ is a given input to the algorithm, it is independent of the parameter $\\sigma_{y0}$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial p_{n+1}}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = 0$. The sensitivity is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{11}^{n+1}}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = \\frac{\\partial s_{11}^{n+1}}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}}$$\nFrom the co-directionality of $\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}$ and $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$, we have:\n$$\\mathbf{s}_{n+1} = \\frac{\\sigma_{e,n+1}}{\\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}} \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})}{\\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}} \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$$\nThe component $s_{11}^{n+1}$ is therefore:\n$$s_{11}^{n+1} = \\frac{s_{11}^{\\mathrm{tr}}}{\\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}} \\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $\\sigma_{y0}$ (while holding inputs $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$, $\\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}$, and $\\kappa_n$ constant) gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial s_{11}^{n+1}}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = \\frac{s_{11}^{\\mathrm{tr}}}{\\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}}$$\nNext, we find the derivative of the updated yield stress. From the hardening law $\\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1}) = \\sigma_{y0} + H(\\kappa_n + \\Delta\\gamma)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = 1 + H \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\gamma}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}}$$\nTo find $\\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\gamma}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}}$, we differentiate the residual equation $R(\\Delta\\gamma, \\sigma_{y0}) = 0$ implicitly with respect to $\\sigma_{y0}$:\n$$R(\\Delta\\gamma, \\sigma_{y0}) = \\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H(\\kappa_n + \\Delta\\gamma)) - 3G\\Delta\\gamma = 0$$\n$$\\frac{dR}{d\\sigma_{y0}} = \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} + \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\Delta\\gamma} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\gamma}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = 0$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = -1$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\Delta\\gamma} = -H - 3G = -(3G+H)$$\nSubstituting these into the total derivative equation:\n$$-1 - (3G+H) \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\gamma}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\gamma}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = -\\frac{1}{3G+H}$$\nNow substitute this back into the derivative of the yield stress:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_y(\\kappa_{n+1})}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = 1 + H \\left(-\\frac{1}{3G+H}\\right) = \\frac{3G+H-H}{3G+H} = \\frac{3G}{3G+H}$$\nFinally, we assemble the full expression for the sensitivity:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{11}^{n+1}}{\\partial \\sigma_{y0}} = \\frac{s_{11}^{\\mathrm{tr}}}{\\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}}} \\left(\\frac{3G}{3G+H}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values.\nFirst, the shear modulus $G$:\n$G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{2(1+0.3)} = \\frac{100}{2.6}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = \\frac{50}{1.3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nThe trial stress components found earlier are $s_{11}^{\\mathrm{tr}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\sigma_e^{\\mathrm{tr}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.

The tasks are specific mathematical derivations that are standard in the field of uncertainty quantification.\n\nWe begin by establishing the necessary statistical properties of the model output $Y = X_1 + X_2 X_3$, given that $X_i \\sim U[0,1]$ are independent for $i=1, 2, 3$. The expectation and variance for a uniform random variable $X \\sim U[0,1]$ are $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{12}$. Higher-order moments are $\\mathbb{E}[X^k] = \\int_0^1 x^k dx = \\frac{1}{k+1}$.\n\nThe expectation of $Y$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[X_1 + X_2 X_3] = \\mathbb{E}[X_1] + \\mathbb{E}[X_2 X_3]\n$$\nDue to independence, $\\mathbb{E}[X_2 X_3] = \\mathbb{E}[X_2]\\mathbb{E}[X_3] = (\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThe variance of $Y$, denoted $\\sigma^2$, is:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\operatorname{Var}(X_1 + X_2 X_3)\n$$\nSince $X_1$ and the product $X_2 X_3$ are independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(X_1) + \\operatorname{Var}(X_2 X_3)\n$$\nWe have $\\operatorname{Var}(X_1) = \\frac{1}{12}$. For the product term:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X_2 X_3) = \\mathbb{E}[(X_2 X_3)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X_2 X_3])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_2^2]\\mathbb{E}[X_3^2] - (\\frac{1}{4})^2\n$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] = \\frac{1}{3}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X_2 X_3) = (\\frac{1}{3})(\\frac{1}{3}) - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16-9}{144} = \\frac{7}{144}\n$$\nThe total variance is:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{7}{144} = \\frac{12}{144} + \\frac{7}{144} = \\frac{19}{144}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the Monte Carlo estimators for $S_1$ and $S_{T1}$. Let $y_A = f(\\boldsymbol{A})$, $y_B = f(\\boldsymbol{B})$, and $y_{A_B^{(1)}} = f(B_1, A_2, A_3)$, where the components of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$ are independent draws from $U[0,1]$.\n\nThe first-order Sobol index is $S_1 = V_1 / \\sigma^2$, where $V_1 = \\operatorname{Var}_{X_1}(\\mathbb{E}[Y|X_1])$. A fundamental identity is $V_1 = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\cdot f(X_1, X'_{-1})] - (\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2$, where $X'_{-1}$ is an independent copy of $X_{-1}$. The Saltelli estimator for $V_1$ leverages this through the identity $\\mathbb{E}[f(\\boldsymbol{B})(f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)}) - f(\\boldsymbol{A}))] = V_1$.\nThe expectation of the estimator term is $\\mathbb{E}[y_B y_{A_B^{(1)}}] - \\mathbb{E}[y_B y_A]$. Since $\\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$ are independent, $\\mathbb{E}[y_B y_A] = (\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2$. The first term is $\\mathbb{E}[f(B_1, B_{-1})f(B_1, A_{-1})]$. Conditioning on $B_1$ yields $\\mathbb{E}_{B_1}[(\\mathbb{E}[Y|X_1=B_1])^2] = \\mathbb{E}_{X_1}[(\\mathbb{E}[Y|X_1])^2]$. The overall expectation is thus $\\mathbb{E}_{X_1}[(\\mathbb{E}[Y|X_1])^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2 = V_1$.\nTherefore, an unbiased estimator for $V_1$ is $\\hat{V}_1 = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N f(\\boldsymbol{B}_n)(f((A_B^{(1)})_n) - f(\\boldsymbol{A}_n))$. The estimator for $S_1$ with known $\\sigma^2$ is $\\hat{S}_1 = \\hat{V}_1 / \\sigma^2$.\n\nThe total-effect index is $S_{T1} = V_{T1} / \\sigma^2$, where $V_{T1} = \\mathbb{E}_{X_{-1}}(\\operatorname{Var}_{X_1}(Y|X_{-1}))$. The Saltelli estimator for $V_{T1}$ is based on the identity $\\mathbb{E}[(f(\\boldsymbol{A}) - f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)}))^2] = 2 V_{T1}$.\nThe expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[(f(A_1, A_{-1}) - f(B_1, A_{-1}))^2]$. Conditioning on $A_{-1}$ and noting $A_1, B_1$ are i.i.d., this becomes $\\mathbb{E}_{A_{-1}}[2\\operatorname{Var}_{X_1}(Y|X_{-1}=A_{-1})] = 2V_{T1}$.\nThus, an unbiased estimator for $V_{T1}$ is $\\hat{V}_{T1} = \\frac{1}{2N}\\sum_{n=1}^N(f(\\boldsymbol{A}_n) - f((A_B^{(1)})_n))^2$. The estimator for $S_{T1}$ with known $\\sigma^2$ is $\\hat{S}_{T1} = \\hat{V}_{T1} / \\sigma^2$.\n\nWhen the true variance $\\sigma^2$ is replaced by an estimator, such as the sample variance $\\hat{\\sigma}^2_A = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{n=1}^N (f(\\boldsymbol{A}_n) - \\bar{f}_A)^2$, the resulting Sobol index estimators $\\tilde{S}_1 = \\hat{V}_1 / \\hat{\\sigma}^2_A$ and $\\tilde{S}_{T1} = \\hat{V}_{T1} / \\hat{\\sigma}^2_A$ become ratio estimators. The expectation of a ratio of random variables is generally not the ratio of their expectations, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{U}/\\hat{V}] \\neq \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{U}]/\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{V}]$. This inequality leads to statistical bias. A second-order Taylor expansion of the ratio $g(u,v)=u/v$ around $(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{U}],\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{V}])$ gives an approximation for the bias: $\\mathbb{E}[g(\\hat{U},\\hat{V})] - g(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{U}],\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{V}]) \\approx \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{U}]\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{V})}{(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{V}])^3} - \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{U}, \\hat{V})}{(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{V}])^2}$. Since the numerators $\\hat{V}_1$ and $\\hat{V}_{T1}$, and the denominator estimator $\\hat{\\sigma}^2_A$, are derived from averages over $N$ samples, their variances and covariances are of order $O(N^{-1})$ for large $N$ under standard regularity conditions. Consequently, the leading terms of the bias are of order $O(N^{-1})$.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact variance of the estimator $\\hat{S}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2 N} \\sum_{n=1}^N T_n$, where $T_n = f(\\boldsymbol{B}_n)(f((A_{B}^{(1)})_n) - f(\\boldsymbol{A}_n))$. As the terms $T_n$ are i.i.d., $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{S}_1) = \\frac{1}{N (\\sigma^2)^2} \\operatorname{Var}(T_1)$.\nLet $T = f(\\boldsymbol{B})(f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)}) - f(\\boldsymbol{A}))$. We need $\\operatorname{Var}(T) = \\mathbb{E}[T^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[T])^2$.\nWe have $\\mathbb{E}[T] = V_1 = \\operatorname{Var}_{X_1}(\\mathbb{E}[Y|X_1])$.\nThe conditional expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[Y|X_1=x_1] = \\mathbb{E}[x_1 + X_2 X_3] = x_1 + \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSo, $V_1 = \\operatorname{Var}(X_1 + 1/4) = \\operatorname{Var}(X_1) = \\frac{1}{12}$. Thus, $(\\mathbb{E}[T])^2 = (\\frac{1}{12})^2 = \\frac{1}{144}$.\n\nTo compute $\\mathbb{E}[T^2] = \\mathbb{E}[f(\\boldsymbol{B})^2(f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)}) - f(\\boldsymbol{A}))^2]$, we evaluate the expectations of the expanded terms using $f(\\boldsymbol{A})=A_1+A_2A_3$, $f(\\boldsymbol{B})=B_1+B_2B_3$, and $f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)})=B_1+A_2A_3$.\nThe calculation involves the following intermediate expectations:\n$\\mathbb{E}[Y^2] = \\sigma^2 + (\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2 = \\frac{19}{144} + (\\frac{3}{4})^2 = \\frac{100}{144} = \\frac{25}{36}$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[(\\mathbb{E}_{X_{-1}}[Y^2|X_1])^2] = \\mathbb{E}_{X_1}[(X_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}X_1 + \\frac{1}{9})^2] = \\int_0^1 (x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{9})^2 dx = \\frac{547}{810}$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[f(\\boldsymbol{B})^2 f(\\boldsymbol{A})f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)})] = \\frac{1343}{2592}$.\n\n$\\mathbb{E}[T^2] = \\mathbb{E}[f(\\boldsymbol{B})^2 f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)})^2] - 2\\mathbb{E}[f(\\boldsymbol{B})^2 f(\\boldsymbol{A})f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)})] + \\mathbb{E}[f(\\boldsymbol{B})^2 f(\\boldsymbol{A})^2]$\n$\\mathbb{E}[f(\\boldsymbol{B})^2 f(\\boldsymbol{A}_B^{(1)})^2] = \\mathbb{E}_{X_1}[(\\mathbb{E}_{X_{-1}}[Y^2|X_1])^2] = \\frac{547}{810}$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[f(\\boldsymbol{B})^2 f(\\boldsymbol{A})^2] = (\\mathbb{E}[Y^2])^2 = (\\frac{25}{36})^2 = \\frac{625}{1296}$.\n$\\mathbb{E}[T^2] = \\frac{547}{810} - 2\\left(\\frac{1343}{2592}\\right) + \\frac{625}{1296} = \\frac{547}{810} - \\frac{1343}{1296} + \\frac{625}{1296} = \\frac{547}{810} - \\frac{718}{1296} = \\frac{131}{1080}$.\n\nNow, we compute $\\operatorname{Var}(T)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(T) = \\mathbb{E}[T^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[T])^2 = \\frac{131}{1080} - \\frac{1}{144} = \\frac{262 - 15}{2160} = \\frac{247}{2160}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the variance of the estimator $\\hat{S}_1$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{S}_1) = \\frac{1}{N (\\sigma^2)^2} \\operatorname{Var}(T) = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{247/2160}{(19/144)^2} = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{247}{2160} \\frac{20736}{361}\n$$\nWe use $247 = 13 \\cdot 19$, $361 = 19^2$, and $\\frac{20736}{2160} = \\frac{144^2}{15 \\cdot 144} = \\frac{144}{15} = \\frac{48}{5}$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{S}_1) = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{13 \\cdot 19}{19^2} \\frac{48}{5} = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{13}{19} \\frac{48}{5} = \\frac{624}{95N}\n$$\nThis is the final analytic expression for the variance of the first-order estimator.",
