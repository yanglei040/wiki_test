            "problem": "Consider a saturated, homogeneous, one-dimensional soil column of length $L$ transporting a dissolved reactive solute. The pore water has a constant average linear velocity $U$, the effective molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute is $D$, and the aqueous reaction is first-order with rate constant $k$. Assume constant porosity and no sources other than the reaction term, and that mechanical deformation is negligible over the timescale of interest so that coupling to deformation only enters through constant coefficients.\n\nStarting from conservation of solute mass and the definitions of advective and diffusive fluxes (Fick’s law) together with first-order reaction kinetics, perform a nondimensionalization using $L$ as the characteristic length and $t_{a} = L/U$ as the advective timescale.

It is based on the standard advection-diffusion-reaction equation, a fundamental concept in transport phenomena and computational geomechanics. All parameters are clearly defined, and the numerical values are physically realistic. The task is unambiguous and leads to a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by establishing the governing partial differential equation for the transport of a reactive solute in a one-dimensional porous medium. The conservation of mass for a solute with concentration $C$ in a control volume is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\phi C)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J_x}{\\partial x} = S\n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the porosity, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $J_x$ is the total solute flux in the $x$-direction, and $S$ is the source/sink term per unit bulk volume.\n\nThe problem states that porosity $\\phi$ is constant. The total flux $J_x$ is the sum of the advective flux, $J_a = (\\phi U) C$, and the diffusive (or more accurately, hydrodynamic dispersive) flux, $J_d = -(\\phi D) \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$. Here, $U$ is the average linear velocity and $D$ is the effective diffusion/dispersion coefficient. Thus, the total flux is:\n$$\nJ_x = \\phi U C - \\phi D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe reaction is a first-order decay, so the sink term, representing the rate of mass loss per unit bulk volume, is $S = -\\phi k C$, where $k$ is the first-order rate constant.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_x$ and $S$ into the conservation equation and assuming $\\phi$ is constant yields:\n$$\n\\phi \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\phi U C - \\phi D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\right) = -\\phi k C\n$$\nDividing by the constant porosity $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( U C - D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\right) = -k C\n$$\nSince $U$ and $D$ are also constant, the equation expands to the advection-diffusion-reaction equation (ADRE):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - k C\n$$\nNext, we nondimensionalize this equation. We introduce the following dimensionless variables, where $C_0$ is a reference concentration:\n$$\nC' = \\frac{C}{C_0}, \\quad x' = \\frac{x}{L}, \\quad t' = \\frac{t}{t_a} = \\frac{t U}{L}\n$$\nWe use the chain rule to express the derivatives in terms of these new variables:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (C_0 C')}{\\partial t'} \\frac{\\partial t'}{\\partial t} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t'} \\left(\\frac{U}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (C_0 C')}{\\partial x'} \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial x'} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial x'} \\right) = \\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (x')^2} \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} = \\frac{C_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (x')^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the ADRE:\n$$\nC_0 \\frac{U}{L} \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t'} + U \\left( C_0 \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial x'} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{C_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (x')^2} \\right) - k (C_0 C')\n$$\nWe divide the entire equation by the leading coefficient group, $C_0 U / L$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{D L}{L^2 U} \\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (x')^2} - \\frac{k L}{U} C'\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficients gives the dimensionless form of the ADRE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial x'} = \\left( \\frac{D}{UL} \\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (x')^2} - \\left( \\frac{kL}{U} \\right) C'\n$$\nFrom this equation, we identify the two requested dimensionless groups.

A single irreversible mineral dissolution reaction removes solid uniformly in space at a constant volumetric rate $r>0$ per unit bulk volume, under isothermal conditions and negligible density changes of the fluid. The reaction induces no mechanical compaction or dilation of the solid skeleton (i.e., the skeleton is mechanically rigid), and the fluid is treated as incompressible so that the bulk volume remains constant.

            "solution": "The solution is derived by first establishing the governing equation for porosity evolution from the law of conservation of solid mass, and then using the Kozeny–Carman constitutive relation to find the permeability evolution.\n\n**1. Porosity Evolution $\\phi(t)$**\nThe total bulk volume of the porous column, $V$, is constant and is the sum of the solid volume, $V_s$, and the pore volume, $V_p$:\n$$V = V_s + V_p$$\nPorosity, $\\phi$, is defined as the ratio of the pore volume to the bulk volume:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{V_p}{V}$$\nThe volume fraction of the solid phase is therefore $(1-\\phi)$, and the solid volume is given by:\n$$V_s = (1-\\phi)V$$\nThe problem states that solid material is removed by dissolution at a constant volumetric rate $r > 0$ per unit bulk volume. This corresponds to the rate of decrease of solid volume. The total rate of change of solid volume, $\\frac{dV_s}{dt}$, is therefore:\n$$\\frac{dV_s}{dt} = -rV$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the solid volume is decreasing.\n\nTo find the evolution of porosity, we differentiate the expression for $V_s$ with respect to time $t$.

It is given by:\n$$k = C \\frac{\\phi^3}{(1-\\phi)^2}$$\nwhere $C$ is a structural coefficient that depends on the pore geometry. The problem states that $C$ is constant throughout the dissolution process. We can determine the value of $C$ using the initial conditions at $t=0$, where $\\phi=\\phi_0$ and $k=k_0$:\n$$k_0 = C \\frac{\\phi_0^3}{(1-\\phi_0)^2}$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$C = k_0 \\frac{(1-\\phi_0)^2}{\\phi_0^3}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the general Kozeny–Carman equation gives the permeability $k(t)$ as a function of the instantaneous porosity $\\phi(t)$ and the initial parameters:\n$$k(t) = \\left( k_0 \\frac{(1-\\phi_0)^2}{\\phi_0^3} \\right) \\frac{\\phi(t)^3}{(1-\\phi(t))^2}$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$k(t) = k_0 \\left( \\frac{\\phi(t)}{\\phi_0} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{1-\\phi_0}{1-\\phi(t)} \\right)^2$$\nTo obtain the explicit time evolution of permeability, we substitute the previously derived expression for $\\phi(t) = \\phi_0 + rt$ into this equation.

Domain of Validity**\nThe derived expressions are valid for the duration of the physical process, which starts at $t=0$ and ends when the solid skeleton is completely dissolved. Complete dissolution is achieved when the solid volume becomes zero, which corresponds to a porosity of $\\phi=1$. Let this time be $t_{final}$. We find $t_{final}$ by setting $\\phi(t_{final}) = 1$ in the porosity evolution equation:\n$$1 = \\phi_0 + r t_{final}$$\n$$t_{final} = \\frac{1-\\phi_0}{r}$$\nSince $\\phi_0 \\in (0,1)$ and $r>0$, $t_{final}$ is a finite positive time.
