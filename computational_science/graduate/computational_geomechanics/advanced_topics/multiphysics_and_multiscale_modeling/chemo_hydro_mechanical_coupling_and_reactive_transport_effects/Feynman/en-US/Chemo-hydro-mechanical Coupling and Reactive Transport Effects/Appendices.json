            "problem": "Consider a saturated, homogeneous, one-dimensional soil column of length $L$ transporting a dissolved reactive solute. The pore water has a constant average linear velocity $U$, the effective molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute is $D$, and the aqueous reaction is first-order with rate constant $k$.

It is based on the standard advection-diffusion-reaction equation, a fundamental concept in transport phenomena and computational geomechanics. All parameters are clearly defined, and the numerical values are physically realistic. The task is unambiguous and leads to a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by establishing the governing partial differential equation for the transport of a reactive solute in a one-dimensional porous medium. The conservation of mass for a solute with concentration $C$ in a control volume is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\phi C)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J_x}{\\partial x} = S\n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the porosity, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $J_x$ is the total solute flux in the $x$-direction, and $S$ is the source/sink term per unit bulk volume.\n\nThe problem states that porosity $\\phi$ is constant. The total flux $J_x$ is the sum of the advective flux, $J_a = (\\phi U) C$, and the diffusive (or more accurately, hydrodynamic dispersive) flux, $J_d = -(\\phi D) \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$. Here, $U$ is the average linear velocity and $D$ is the effective diffusion/dispersion coefficient. Thus, the total flux is:\n$$\nJ_x = \\phi U C - \\phi D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe reaction is a first-order decay, so the sink term, representing the rate of mass loss per unit bulk volume, is $S = -\\phi k C$, where $k$ is the first-order rate constant.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_x$ and $S$ into the conservation equation and assuming $\\phi$ is constant yields:\n$$\n\\phi \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\phi U C - \\phi D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\right) = -\\phi k C\n$$\nDividing by the constant porosity $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( U C - D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\right) = -k C\n$$\nSince $U$ and $D$ are also constant, the equation expands to the advection-diffusion-reaction equation (ADRE):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - k C\n$$\nNext, we nondimensionalize this equation.

The Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}$, is the inverse of the coefficient of the second-derivative term, representing the ratio of advective to diffusive transport rates:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D}\n$$\nThe Damköhler number, $\\mathrm{Da}$, is the coefficient of the reaction term, representing the ratio of the characteristic advective transport time to the characteristic reaction time:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{kL}{U}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values of these dimensionless numbers using the provided data:\n$U = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $L = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $D = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, and $k = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe Péclet number is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{(10^{-5}) \\times (0.1)}{10^{-9}} = \\frac{10^{-6}}{10^{-9}} = 10^3 = 1000\n$$\nThe Damköhler number is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{(10^{-3}) \\times (0.1)}{10^{-5}} = \\frac{10^{-4}}{10^{-5}} = 10^1 = 10\n$$\nFinally, we determine the transport-reaction regime integer, $r$, based on the provided classification scheme.

A single irreversible mineral dissolution reaction removes solid uniformly in space at a constant volumetric rate $r>0$ per unit bulk volume, under isothermal conditions and negligible density changes of the fluid.

State the domain of validity.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed based on the specified criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of continuum mechanics for porous media and reactive transport. Porosity, permeability, mass conservation, and the Kozeny–Carman relation are standard concepts in geomechanics and hydrology. The assumptions of a rigid solid matrix and uniform dissolution are common idealizations used to obtain analytical solutions in this field.

It requests the time evolution of state variables $\\phi$ and $k$. The problem is well-defined and leads to a unique solution within the given framework.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. All terms used are standard within the relevant scientific discipline.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions (e.g., scientific unsoundness, missing information, ambiguity). It is a standard, albeit simplified, theoretical problem in chemo-mechanical processes in porous media.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe solution is derived by first establishing the governing equation for porosity evolution from the law of conservation of solid mass, and then using the Kozeny–Carman constitutive relation to find the permeability evolution.\n\n**1. Porosity Evolution $\\phi(t)$**\nThe total bulk volume of the porous column, $V$, is constant and is the sum of the solid volume, $V_s$, and the pore volume, $V_p$:\n$$V = V_s + V_p$$\nPorosity, $\\phi$, is defined as the ratio of the pore volume to the bulk volume:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{V_p}{V}$$\nThe volume fraction of the solid phase is therefore $(1-\\phi)$, and the solid volume is given by:\n$$V_s = (1-\\phi)V$$\nThe problem states that solid material is removed by dissolution at a constant volumetric rate $r > 0$ per unit bulk volume. This corresponds to the rate of decrease of solid volume. The total rate of change of solid volume, $\\frac{dV_s}{dt}$, is therefore:\n$$\\frac{dV_s}{dt} = -rV$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the solid volume is decreasing.\n\nTo find the evolution of porosity, we differentiate the expression for $V_s$ with respect to time $t$. Since the bulk volume $V$ is constant:\n$$\\frac{dV_s}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[(1-\\phi(t))V\\right] = -V\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{dV_s}{dt}$ yields the governing ordinary differential equation for porosity:\n$$-V\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = -rV$$\n$$\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = r$$\nThis equation is integrated with respect to time, using the initial condition $\\phi(t=0) = \\phi_0$:\n$$\\int_{\\phi_0}^{\\phi(t)} d\\phi' = \\int_{0}^{t} r \\, dt'$$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$\\phi(t) - \\phi_0 = rt$$\nThus, the expression for the time evolution of porosity is:\n$$\\phi(t) = \\phi_0 + rt$$\n\n**2. Permeability Evolution $k(t)$**\nThe Kozeny–Carman relation provides a constitutive law linking permeability $k$ to porosity $\\phi$. It is given by:\n$$k = C \\frac{\\phi^3}{(1-\\phi)^2}$$\nwhere $C$ is a structural coefficient that depends on the pore geometry. The problem states that $C$ is constant throughout the dissolution process. We can determine the value of $C$ using the initial conditions at $t=0$, where $\\phi=\\phi_0$ and $k=k_0$:\n$$k_0 = C \\frac{\\phi_0^3}{(1-\\phi_0)^2}$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$C = k_0 \\frac{(1-\\phi_0)^2}{\\phi_0^3}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the general Kozeny–Carman equation gives the permeability $k(t)$ as a function of the instantaneous porosity $\\phi(t)$ and the initial parameters:\n$$k(t) = \\left( k_0 \\frac{(1-\\phi_0)^2}{\\phi_0^3} \\right) \\frac{\\phi(t)^3}{(1-\\phi(t))^2}$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$k(t) = k_0 \\left( \\frac{\\phi(t)}{\\phi_0} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{1-\\phi_0}{1-\\phi(t)} \\right)^2$$\nTo obtain the explicit time evolution of permeability, we substitute the previously derived expression for $\\phi(t) = \\phi_0 + rt$ into this equation. We also need the term for $1-\\phi(t)$:\n$$1-\\phi(t) = 1 - (\\phi_0 + rt) = (1-\\phi_0) - rt$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $k(t)$ yields:\n$$k(t) = k_0 \\left( \\frac{\\phi_0 + rt}{\\phi_0} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{1-\\phi_0}{(1-\\phi_0) - rt} \\right)^2$$\n\n**3. Domain of Validity**\nThe derived expressions are valid for the duration of the physical process, which starts at $t=0$ and ends when the solid skeleton is completely dissolved. Complete dissolution is achieved when the solid volume becomes zero, which corresponds to a porosity of $\\phi=1$. Let this time be $t_{final}$. We find $t_{final}$ by setting $\\phi(t_{final}) = 1$ in the porosity evolution equation:\n$$1 = \\phi_0 + r t_{final}$$\n$$t_{final} = \\frac{1-\\phi_0}{r}$$\nSince $\\phi_0 \\in (0,1)$ and $r>0$, $t_{final}$ is a finite positive time. The domain of validity for both $\\phi(t)$ and $k(t)$ is therefore the time interval $t \\in [0, t_{final}]$, or:\n$$t \\in \\left[0, \\frac{1-\\phi_0}{r}\\right]$$\nAt the endpoint $t = t_{final}$, the porosity is $\\phi=1$, and the denominator of the expression for $k(t)$ becomes zero, leading to an infinite permeability, which is the expected behavior from the Kozeny-Carman model as the solid medium vanishes.\n\nThe final expressions for $\\phi(t)$ and $k(t)$ are collected as a row vector.",
