            "problem": "An unsaturated soil is modeled under isotropic loading within the framework of computational geomechanics. The total mean stress is defined by $p = \\tfrac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor and $\\mathrm{tr}(\\cdot)$ denotes the trace. The pore space contains two phases, water and air, with pore water pressure $p_w$ and pore air pressure $p_a$. The degree of saturation is $S_r$, and the effective stress is described via Bishop’s concept with a saturation-dependent scalar parameter $\\chi$ taken as $\\chi = S_r$.\n\nStarting from the effective stress principle for saturated soils and its extension to unsaturated soils that partitions the contribution of pore pressure between water and air according to $\\chi$, derive the expression for the effective mean stress $p'$ in terms of $p$, $p_w$, $p_a$, and $\\chi$. Then, evaluate $p'$ for $S_r = 0.6$, $p_w = 50$ kilopascal (kPa), $p_a = 100$ kilopascal (kPa), $\\chi = S_r$, and total mean stress $p = 300$ kilopascal (kPa).

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. It is a standard application of effective stress principles in the geomechanics of unsaturated soils.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the effective mean stress, $p'$. The effective stress principle for unsaturated soils, according to Bishop's concept, extends Terzaghi's principle for saturated media. Bishop’s effective stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$, is given by:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p_{eff} \\boldsymbol{I} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the total Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor, and $p_{eff}$ is the effective pore pressure. The problem states that the pore pressure contribution is partitioned between the water phase pressure, $p_w$, and the air phase pressure, $p_a$, using a scalar parameter $\\chi$. This defines the effective pore pressure as:\n$$ p_{eff} = \\chi p_w + (1-\\chi) p_a $$\nAnother common form of Bishop's stress is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p_a \\boldsymbol{I} + \\chi(p_a - p_w)\\boldsymbol{I}$. Expanding this gives $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - [p_a - \\chi p_a + \\chi p_w]\\boldsymbol{I} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - [(1-\\chi)p_a + \\chi p_w]\\boldsymbol{I}$, which is identical to the expression above.\n\nThe effective mean stress, $p'$, is defined as one-third of the trace of the effective stress tensor:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}') $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p_{eff} \\boldsymbol{I}) $$\nUsing the linearity property of the trace operator, $\\mathrm{tr}(A-B) = \\mathrm{tr}(A) - \\mathrm{tr}(B)$:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) - \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(p_{eff} \\boldsymbol{I}) $$\nThe first term is the definition of the total mean stress, $p = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$. The second term simplifies as follows, noting that $p_{eff}$ is a scalar and the trace of the $3 \\times 3$ identity tensor is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{I}) = 3$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(p_{eff} \\boldsymbol{I}) = \\frac{1}{3} p_{eff} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{I}) = \\frac{1}{3} p_{eff} (3) = p_{eff} $$\nTherefore, the effective mean stress is related to the total mean stress by:\n$$ p' = p - p_{eff} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{eff}$, we obtain the final derived expression for $p'$:\n$$ p' = p - [\\chi p_w + (1-\\chi) p_a] $$\n\nNext, we evaluate $p'$ for the given numerical values:\nTotal mean stress, $p = 300$ kPa.\nPore water pressure, $p_w = 50$ kPa.\nPore air pressure, $p_a = 100$ kPa.\nDegree of saturation, $S_r = 0.6$.\nBishop's parameter, $\\chi = S_r = 0.6$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $p'$:\n$$ p' = 300 - [0.6 \\times 50 + (1-0.6) \\times 100] $$\n$$ p' = 300 - [30 + 0.4 \\times 100] $$\n$$ p' = 300 - [30 + 40] $$\n$$ p' = 300 - 70 $$\n$$ p' = 230 $$\nThe effective mean stress is $230$ kilopascal (kPa).\n\nNow, we analyze the direction of change in shear strength relative to fully saturated conditions. For a frictional material, shear strength typically increases with increasing effective mean stress (e.g., as described by Mohr-Coulomb or Drucker-Prager failure criteria). We need to compare the calculated effective mean stress for the unsaturated case, $p'_{unsat} = 230$ kPa, with the effective mean stress under fully saturated conditions, $p'_{sat}$.\nFor fully saturated conditions, $S_r = 1$, and consequently $\\chi=1$. The pore space is filled with water, so the relevant pore pressure is $p_w = 50$ kPa. Using the general formula with $\\chi=1$:\n$$ p'_{sat} = p - [1 \\cdot p_w + (1-1) \\cdot p_a] = p - p_w $$\nThis recovers Terzaghi's effective stress principle for saturated media. Using the given values for $p$ and $p_w$:\n$$ p'_{sat} = 300 - 50 = 250 \\text{ kPa} $$\nComparing the two cases: $p'_{unsat} = 230 \\text{ kPa}$ and $p'_{sat} = 250 \\text{ kPa}$.\nSince $p'_{unsat} < p'_{sat}$, the effective mean stress in the unsaturated state is lower than in the fully saturated state for the given conditions. A lower effective mean stress implies less confinement on the soil skeleton, which reduces the frictional resistance. Therefore, the shear strength in this specific unsaturated case is *lower* than it would be under fully saturated conditions with the same total stress and pore water pressure.\n\nFinally, we comment on the effect of an isotropic damage variable, $D \\in [0,1)$. The problem explicitly states that the damage variable \"scales the elastic stiffness but does not alter the effective stress definition.\" This is a common postulate in continuum damage mechanics for porous media, often referred to as the principle of effective stress equivalence. The constitutive law might change to $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = (1-D) \\mathbb{C}_0 : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e$, but the definition of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p_{eff} \\boldsymbol{I}$ remains independent of $D$.\n1.  **Effect on computed $p'$**: Since the definition and calculation of $p'$ depend only on total stress ($p$) and pore pressures ($p_w, p_a$), which are given as external state variables, the value of the damage variable $D$ has no effect on the computed value of $p' = 230$ kPa.\n2.  **Effect on the qualitative inference about shear strength**: The inference is based on the comparison of $p'_{unsat}$ and $p'_{sat}$. As the calculation of both these quantities is independent of $D$, the inequality $p'_{unsat} < p'_{sat}$ holds regardless of the value of $D$. Consequently, the qualitative conclusion that the shear strength is lower in the unsaturated case compared to the saturated case (for these specific pressures) is also unaffected by the presence of isotropic damage, under the assumption that the failure criterion is a function of effective stress and is not explicitly dependent on $D$. While damage weakens the material and reduces its absolute strength, the *relative* change in strength potential due to the change in effective stress state from saturated to unsaturated is not altered by $D$ within this model's framework.",

The total principal stresses are $\\sigma_1$ (axial) and $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3$ (confining). The corresponding effective principal stresses are $\\sigma'_1 = \\sigma_1 - p_f$ and $\\sigma'_2 = \\sigma'_3 = \\sigma_3 - p_f$.

We identify the effective elastic constants by comparing strain components:\n$$\n\\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{(1-D)^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{E_0} \\left[ \\sigma_z - \\nu_0 (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) \\right] \\right) = \\frac{1}{E_0(1-D)^2} \\left[ \\sigma_z - \\nu_0 (\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y) \\right]\n$$\nComparing with the generic form, we find the damaged elastic constants under energy equivalence:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ee}} = E_0(1-D)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{ee}} = \\nu_0\n$$\nThe algebraic form for the constrained modulus is the same as before, but with these new parameters:\n$$\nM_{\\text{ee}} = E_{\\text{ee}} \\frac{1 - \\nu_{\\text{ee}}}{(1+\\nu_{\\text{ee}})(1-2\\nu_{\\text{ee}})}\n$$\nSubstituting $E_{\\text{ee}} = E_0(1-D)^2$ and $\\nu_{\\text{ee}} = \\nu_0$:\n$$\nM_{\\text{ee}} = E_0(1-D)^2 \\frac{1 - \\nu_0}{(1+\\nu_0)(1-2\\nu_0)}\n$$\n\n**3. Ratio of the Constrained Moduli**\n\nWe now compute the ratio $R = M_{\\text{se}} / M_{\\text{ee}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{M_{\\text{se}}}{M_{\\text{ee}}} = \\frac{E_0(1-D) \\frac{1 - \\nu_0}{(1+\\nu_0)(1-2\\nu_0)}}{E_0(1-D)^2 \\frac{1 - \\nu_0}{(1+\\nu_0)(1-2\\nu_0)}}\n$$\nThe terms involving $E_0$ and $\\nu_0$ cancel out, leaving a simple expression:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1-D}{(1-D)^2} = \\frac{1}{1-D}\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression for the damage variable $D = 1 - \\exp(-0.075)$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{1 - (1 - \\exp(-0.075))} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-0.075)} = \\exp(0.075)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures:\n$$\nR = \\exp(0.075) \\approx 1.07788411\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.078$.",
