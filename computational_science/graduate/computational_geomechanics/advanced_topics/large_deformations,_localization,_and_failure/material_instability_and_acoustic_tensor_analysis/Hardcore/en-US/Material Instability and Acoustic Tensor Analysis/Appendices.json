This first exercise provides essential practice in this core competency.

            "problem": "Consider a cross-anisotropic (transversely isotropic) geomaterial with axis of symmetry aligned with the unit vector $\\boldsymbol{e}_{3}$ (normal to the bedding plane). In small-strain, linear elasticity, the incremental constitutive response is defined by the fourth-order stiffness tensor $C_{ijkl}$ possessing the usual minor and major symmetries. For transverse isotropy about $\\boldsymbol{e}_{3}$, the five independent stiffness constants are $C_{11}$, $C_{33}$, $C_{13}$, $C_{44}$, and $C_{66}$, with $C_{12}$ implied by $C_{66} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(C_{11}-C_{12}\\right)$. The nonzero components needed for analysis are the normal–normal parts $C_{1111}$, $C_{2222}$, $C_{3333}$, $C_{1122}$, $C_{1133}$, $C_{2233}$, and the shear parts $C_{1212}$, $C_{1313}$, $C_{2323}$, consistent with transverse isotropy.\n\nThe acoustic tensor $A(\\boldsymbol{n})$ associated with propagation direction $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is defined by $A_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{n}) = C_{ikjl}\\,n_{k}\\,n_{l}$.

A double zero eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}) = \\lambda_{2}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}) = 0$ at a unique $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$ prevents localization because the two zero eigenvalues annihilate each other’s effect in the incremental boundary value problem.\n- C.

The analysis will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Evaluation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the eigenvalues of the acoustic tensor $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n})$. Loss of strong ellipticity, signaling the potential for strain localization into a shear band with normal $\\mathbf{n}$, occurs when $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n})$ ceases to be positive definite. The onset condition is the first instance where $\\min_{\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{S}^2} \\lambda_1(\\mathbf{n}) = 0$. Let $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$ be a normal vector where this minimum is achieved. The behavior of the solution near the instability point depends critically on the multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue at $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\n\nThis option contrasts the geometric implications of a single versus a double zero eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star})$.\n\n-   **Case 1: Single zero eigenvalue.** If $\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}) = 0$ and $\\lambda_{2}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star})  0$, the condition $\\det \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n}) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 0$ is satisfied at $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$. Generically, the function $\\det \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n})$ over the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$ will have isolated zeros. For typical material symmetries and stress states (e.g., biaxial), these zeros appear as a conjugate pair of normals $\\pm \\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$. This corresponds to the classical prediction of two conjugate planar shear bands. This statement is a cornerstone of localization theory.\n\n-   **Case 2: Double zero eigenvalue.** If $\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}) = \\lambda_{2}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}) = 0$ and $\\lambda_{3}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star})  0$, the situation is degenerate. This is a higher-order condition that requires specific material properties and stress states. At such a point, the surface defined by $\\det \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n}) = 0$ is singular. A local analysis (Taylor expansion of the eigenvalues around $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$) reveals that the set of normals satisfying $\\det \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n}) \\approx 0$ forms a cone centered at $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$. This implies that localization is not restricted to a single plane but can occur along a continuous family of planes whose normals lie on this cone. This phenomenon is known as conical or non-planar localization.\n\nTherefore, the statement accurately distinguishes the geometric nature of the set of admissible localization normals for these two cases.\n**Verdict for A: Correct**\n\n**Option B Analysis**\n\nThis option claims that a double zero eigenvalue *prevents* localization due to an \"annihilation\" effect. This is fundamentally contrary to the physical and mathematical meaning of the acoustic tensor's eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n})$ are related to the squares of propagation speeds of plane waves in the direction $\\mathbf{n}$. A zero eigenvalue indicates that a stationary wave (a discontinuity) can exist, which is the definition of localization. Two zero eigenvalues imply that the kernel of $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n})$ is two-dimensional, meaning there is a two-parameter family of possible polarization vectors for the jump in the velocity gradient. This represents a more severe form of instability, allowing for more complex localization modes, rather than preventing localization altogether. The notion of \"annihilation\" is without physical or mathematical basis in this context.\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C Analysis**\n\nThis option describes a specific physical scenario that leads to a double zero eigenvalue and the resulting observable pattern.\n\n-   **Conditions for a double zero eigenvalue:** The statement claims that a non-associated Drucker–Prager model with a large friction–dilatancy gap ($\\eta - \\beta \\gg 0$) and critical softening ($H  0$ and small) can realize a state with $\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}) = \\lambda_{2}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}) = 0$ for $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$ aligned with the major principal stress axis $\\mathbf{e}_1$. This is a well-documented theoretical result. The non-associativity (meaning $\\mathbf{a} \\neq \\mathbf{b}$, which for Drucker-Prager means friction coefficient $\\eta$ differs from dilatancy coefficient $\\beta$) introduces non-symmetry into the tangent modulus, which is a key ingredient for this type of instability. The condition $H + \\mathbf{b} : \\mathbb{C}^{\\text{e}} : \\mathbf{a} \\to 0^{+}$ signifies the approach to the 'vertex' or a limit point on the yield surface in some sense, where the denominator of the plastic correction term becomes small, leading to a strong departure from elasticity. Research (notably by Bigoni and Hueckel) has shown that these conditions do indeed lead to the coalescence of two eigenvalues to zero, often for a normal aligned with an axis of material and/or loading symmetry.\n\n-   **Observable Pattern:** Given that the set of admissible normals forms a cone with its axis along $\\mathbf{e}_1$, we must consider its intersection with the plane of deformation. The problem specifies plane-strain kinematics. The kinematic condition for localization in plane strain requires the shear band normal $\\mathbf{n}$ and the polarization vector $\\mathbf{m}$ to satisfy certain constraints. The analysis by Rice shows that for plane strain, the normals of the shear bands must lie in the plane of deformation. The intersection of the cone of normals (with axis $\\mathbf{e}_1$) with the plane of deformation (the $\\mathbf{e}_2–\\mathbf{e}_3$ plane) yields a circle of possible normal directions. While a continuous family of normals is possible, experiments often show a selection of two symmetric directions, forming a characteristic 'X-pattern'. This statement accurately reflects the standard interpretation of how this conical instability manifests in a plane-strain test on sand.\n\nThe statement is a condensed but accurate summary of a sophisticated result in geomechanics.\n**Verdict for C: Correct**\n\n**Option D Analysis**\n\nThis option makes two claims following from the premise of a double zero eigenvalue.\n\n-   **Claim 1: Incompressibility implies $\\lambda_{3}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}) = 0$.** This is incorrect. First, the Drucker–Prager material as described is not incompressible; it is pressure-sensitive and generally exhibits plastic volume change (dilatancy or contractancy, with $\\beta \\neq 0$). The elastic part is compressible ($K  0$). There is no general \"incompressibility constraint.\" Second, even if we were to consider a hypothetical incompressible material, it would not imply $\\lambda_3=0$. For an incompressible elastic material, one of the wave speeds (related to the P-wave) becomes infinite, so the corresponding eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{A}^e(\\mathbf{n})$ would be infinite. In the elastoplastic case, the situation is more complex, but there is no principle stating that if two eigenvalues are zero, the third must also be. The literature explicitly treats the case $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=0$ with $\\lambda_30$, as it is the physically relevant one for this instability.\n\n-   **Claim 2: This would mean $\\mathbb{C}^{\\text{tan}}$ vanishes \"in all directions at $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$\" and no finite localization angle can be defined.** If all three eigenvalues were zero, $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=\\lambda_3=0$, then the acoustic tensor $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star})$ would be the zero tensor. This is possible and corresponds to the \"vertex singularity\" where $H + \\mathbf{b} : \\mathbb{C}^{\\text{e}} : \\mathbf{a} = 0$. In this case, the tangent modulus $\\mathbb{C}^{\\text{tan}}$ becomes singular. However, $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n}^{\\star})=\\mathbf{0}$ does not mean $\\mathbb{C}^{\\text{tan}}$ is a zero tensor. More importantly, it would not mean \"no finite localization angle can be defined\". A localization normal $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$ is precisely what has been found. This situation would represent a total loss of stiffness for any mode with wave normal $\\mathbf{n}^{\\star}$, a very severe instability, not a lack of a definable angle.\n\nThe entire statement is built on flawed premises.\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect**\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n-   Option A is correct.\n-   Option B is incorrect.\n-   Option C is correct.\n-   Option D is incorrect.\n\nThe correct options are A and C.",

The kinematic measures are the micropolar distortion $\\gamma_{ij} = u_{i,j} - \\epsilon_{ijk} \\varphi_{k}$ and the curvature $\\kappa_{ij} = \\varphi_{i,j}$, where $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita tensor.

A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for the specified anti-plane shear mode, then applying the plane wave ansatz to derive the acoustic tensor, and finally analyzing the resulting dispersion relation.\n\nFirst, we determine the relevant components of the micropolar distortion $\\gamma_{ij} = u_{i,j} - \\epsilon_{ijk} \\varphi_{k}$. Given that $u_1=u_3=0$, $\\varphi_1=\\varphi_2=0$, and all fields depend only on $x_1$, the only potentially non-zero components of $u_{i,j}$ are $u_{2,1}$. The only non-zero component of $\\varphi_k$ is $\\varphi_3$.\nThe non-zero components of $\\gamma_{ij}$ are:\n$$\n\\gamma_{21} = u_{2,1} - \\epsilon_{21k}\\varphi_k = u_{2,1} - \\epsilon_{213}\\varphi_3 = u_{2,1} - (-1)\\varphi_3 = u_{2,1} + \\varphi_3\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{12} = u_{1,2} - \\epsilon_{12k}\\varphi_k = 0 - \\epsilon_{123}\\varphi_3 = -(1)\\varphi_3 = -\\varphi_3\n$$\nAll other components of $\\gamma_{ij}$ are zero.\n\nThe symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of the relevant distortion tensor components are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{sym}(\\gamma)_{12} = \\mathrm{sym}(\\gamma)_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{12} + \\gamma_{21}) = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\varphi_3 + u_{2,1} + \\varphi_3) = \\frac{1}{2}u_{2,1}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{skw}(\\gamma)_{12} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{12} - \\gamma_{21}) = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\varphi_3 - (u_{2,1} + \\varphi_3)) = -\\frac{1}{2}(u_{2,1} + 2\\varphi_3)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{skw}(\\gamma)_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{21} - \\gamma_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{2,1} + \\varphi_3 - (-\\varphi_3)) = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{2,1} + 2\\varphi_3)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the given constitutive relations for stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{12} = 2\\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{2}u_{2,1}\\right) + 2\\kappa \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(u_{2,1} + 2\\varphi_3)\\right) = (\\mu - \\kappa)u_{2,1} - 2\\kappa\\varphi_3\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{21} = 2\\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{2}u_{2,1}\\right) + 2\\kappa \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(u_{2,1} + 2\\varphi_3)\\right) = (\\mu + \\kappa)u_{2,1} + 2\\kappa\\varphi_3\n$$\nFor the couple stress, the only relevant curvature component is $\\kappa_{31} = \\varphi_{3,1}$, so $m_{31} = \\eta\\varphi_{3,1}$.\n\nNext, we substitute these into the balance laws.\nThe balance of linear momentum, $\\sigma_{ij,j} = \\rho \\ddot{u}_i$, for $i=2$ is $\\sigma_{2j,j} = \\rho \\ddot{u}_2$. As fields only vary with $x_1$, this simplifies to $\\sigma_{21,1} = \\rho \\ddot{u}_2$. Substituting the expression for $\\sigma_{21}$:\n$$\n((\\mu + \\kappa)u_{2,1} + 2\\kappa \\varphi_3)_{,1} = \\rho \\ddot{u}_2 \\implies (\\mu + \\kappa)u_{2,11} + 2\\kappa \\varphi_{3,1} = \\rho \\ddot{u}_2\n$$\nThis is the first governing PDE.\n\nThe balance of angular momentum, $m_{ij,j} + \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_{jk} = J \\ddot{\\varphi}_i$, for $i=3$ is $m_{3j,j} + \\epsilon_{3jk} \\sigma_{jk} = J \\ddot{\\varphi}_3$. With variation in $x_1$ only, this becomes $m_{31,1} + \\epsilon_{312}\\sigma_{21} + \\epsilon_{321}\\sigma_{12} = J \\ddot{\\varphi}_3$.\nUsing the standard convention $\\epsilon_{123}=1$ (so $\\epsilon_{312}=1, \\epsilon_{321}=-1$), the equation is $m_{31,1} + \\sigma_{21} - \\sigma_{12} = J \\ddot{\\varphi}_3$.\nThe stress difference is $\\sigma_{21} - \\sigma_{12} = ((\\mu + \\kappa)u_{2,1} + 2\\kappa\\varphi_3) - ((\\mu - \\kappa)u_{2,1} - 2\\kappa\\varphi_3) = 2\\kappa u_{2,1} + 4\\kappa\\varphi_3$.\nSubstituting this and $m_{31,1} = (\\eta\\varphi_{3,1})_{,1} = \\eta\\varphi_{3,11}$ into the balance law gives the second governing PDE:\n$$\n\\eta\\varphi_{3,11} + 2\\kappa u_{2,1} + 4\\kappa \\varphi_3 = J \\ddot{\\varphi}_3\n$$\n\nNow, we introduce the plane wave ansatz, $u_2 = U\\exp(i(kx_1-\\omega t))$ and $\\varphi_3 = P\\exp(i(kx_1-\\omega t))$. The required derivatives are:\n$u_{2,1} = ikU\\exp(\\dots)$, $u_{2,11} = -k^2U\\exp(\\dots)$, $\\ddot{u}_2 = -\\omega^2U\\exp(\\dots)$.\n$\\varphi_{3,1} = ikP\\exp(\\dots)$, $\\varphi_{3,11} = -k^2P\\exp(\\dots)$, $\\ddot{\\varphi}_3 = -\\omega^2P\\exp(\\dots)$.\nSubstituting these into the two PDEs and canceling the common exponential factor yields a system of linear algebraic equations for the amplitudes $U$ and $P$:\nFrom the linear momentum balance:\n$$\n(\\mu + \\kappa)(-k^2 U) + 2\\kappa (ik P) = \\rho(-\\omega^2 U) \\implies ((\\mu + \\kappa)k^2 - \\rho\\omega^2)U - 2ik\\kappa P = 0\n$$\nFrom the angular momentum balance:\n$$\n\\eta(-k^2 P) + 2\\kappa(ik U) + 4\\kappa P = J(-\\omega^2 P) \\implies 2ik\\kappa U + (\\eta k^2 + 4\\kappa - J\\omega^2)P = 0\n$$\nThis system can be written in matrix form as $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n},\\omega) \\begin{pmatrix} U \\\\ P \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n},\\omega)$ is the frequency-dependent dynamic acoustic tensor for propagation along $\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{e}_1$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n},\\omega) = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\mu + \\kappa)k^2 - \\rho \\omega^2  -2ik\\kappa \\\\ 2ik\\kappa  \\eta k^2 + 4\\kappa - J \\omega^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe off-diagonal terms are $A_{12} = -2ik\\kappa$ and $A_{21} = 2ik\\kappa$. Since $\\overline{A_{21}} = \\overline{2ik\\kappa} = -2ik\\kappa = A_{12}$, and the diagonal terms are real, the matrix is complex Hermitian, as required.\n\nFor a non-trivial solution $(U,P)^T \\neq (0,0)^T$, the determinant of the acoustic tensor must be zero, $\\det\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{n},\\omega) = 0$. This gives the dispersion relation:\n$$\n((\\mu + \\kappa)k^2 - \\rho \\omega^2)(\\eta k^2 + 4\\kappa - J \\omega^2) - (-2ik\\kappa)(2ik\\kappa) = 0\n$$\n$$\n((\\mu + \\kappa)k^2 - \\rho \\omega^2)(\\eta k^2 + 4\\kappa - J \\omega^2) - 4k^2\\kappa^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\omega^2$ as a function of $k^2$, defining two dispersive branches.\n\nTo find the cutoff frequency, we analyze the dispersion relation in the limit $k \\to 0$. Setting $k=0$ in the equation:\n$$\n(0 - \\rho \\omega^2)(0 + 4\\kappa - J \\omega^2) - 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\rho \\omega^2 (4\\kappa - J \\omega^2) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has two solutions for $\\omega^2$:\n1. $\\omega^2 = 0$: This is the acoustic branch. The frequency goes to zero as the wavelength becomes infinite, corresponding to rigid body motion.\n2. $4\\kappa - J \\omega^2 = 0$: This gives $\\omega^2 = \\frac{4\\kappa}{J}$. This branch has a non-zero frequency even at zero wavenumber ($k=0$). This is the micro-rotational (or optic) branch. The corresponding cutoff angular frequency, which we denote $\\omega_r$, is:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\kappa}{J}}\n$$\nThis mode at $k=0$ corresponds to a spatially uniform micro-rotation of the entire medium, where the internal restoring couple is balanced by the micro-inertia.\n\nThe onset of material instability (e.g., strain localization) is signaled by the condition $\\det\\mathbf{A}=0$ for a real wavenumber $k$. This typically occurs when the tangent modulus $\\mu$ degrades due to material softening. In the quasi-static limit ($\\omega=0$), the condition $\\det\\mathbf{A}=0$ becomes $(\\mu+\\kappa)k^2(\\eta k^2+4\\kappa)-4k^2\\kappa^2=0$. For $k \\neq 0$, this gives $\\eta(\\mu+\\kappa)k^2 + 4\\kappa\\mu = 0$. For a real $k$ to exist, we must have $-\\kappa  \\mu \\le 0$. The instability first occurs at the upper bound of this range, i.e., at a critical modulus $\\mu_{crit}^{qs} = 0$, which corresponds to the long-wavelength limit ($k \\to 0$).\n\nIn the dynamic case (finite $\\omega > 0$), the presence of the inertial terms $\\rho\\omega^2$ and $J\\omega^2$ provides resistance to the formation of deformation patterns. This is known as inertial stabilization. For any finite frequency $\\omega$, the long-wavelength modes ($k \\to 0$) are strongly stabilized. Consequently, the instability that occurred at $k \\to 0$ in the quasi-static case is suppressed. Instability must instead initiate at a shorter wavelength (larger $k$). A detailed analysis shows that the critical modulus for dynamic instability is lowered. For instance, in the limit of high-frequency oscillations or short-wavelength perturbations ($k \\to \\infty$), the critical modulus approaches $\\mu_{crit}^{dyn} = -\\kappa$. Since $\\mu_{crit}^{dyn}  \\mu_{crit}^{qs}$, the material must undergo more significant softening (i.e., $\\mu$ must drop to a more negative value) before it becomes unstable under rapid loading compared to slow (quasi-static) loading. Therefore, rapid loading delays the onset of instability.\n\nThe cutoff frequency for the micro-rotational branch is derived, as requested, from the $k \\to 0$ limit of the dispersion relation.",
