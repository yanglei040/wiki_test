            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the stress-amplitude reflection and transmission coefficients for a one-dimensional ($1\\text{D}$) P-wave normally incident on an interface between two distinct linear elastic media, followed by a numerical evaluation for given material properties. The derivation will be based on the principles of wave propagation in continuous media and the application of continuity conditions at the interface.\n\nLet the interface be located at $x=0$. Medium $1$ occupies the half-space $x<0$ and medium $2$ occupies the half-space $x>0$. The physical properties (mass density $\\rho$, P-wave speed $c_P$) are denoted with subscripts $1$ and $2$ for the respective media. The P-wave impedance is defined as $Z_j = \\rho_j c_{P,j}$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nWe represent the waves as harmonic functions of position $x$ and time $t$. For a $1\\text{D}$ P-wave, we are interested in the normal stress $\\sigma(x,t)$ (equivalent to normal traction on a plane perpendicular to the x-axis) and the normal particle velocity $v(x,t)$.\n\nIn medium $1$ ($x<0$), the total wave field is a superposition of the incident wave propagating in the $+x$ direction and the reflected wave propagating in the $-x$ direction.\nThe incident stress wave is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_I(x,t) = \\tilde{\\sigma}_I \\exp\\left(i(k_1 x - \\omega t)\\right) $$\nThe reflected stress wave is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_R(x,t) = \\tilde{\\sigma}_R \\exp\\left(i(-k_1 x - \\omega t)\\right) $$\nHere, $\\tilde{\\sigma}_I$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_R$ are the complex amplitudes of the incident and reflected stress waves, respectively. The angular frequency is $\\omega$, and the wavenumber in medium $1$ is $k_1 = \\omega / c_{P,1}$.\n\nIn medium $2$ ($x>0$), there is only a transmitted wave propagating in the $+x$ direction:\n$$ \\sigma_T(x,t) = \\tilde{\\sigma}_T \\exp\\left(i(k_2 x - \\omega t)\\right) $$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\sigma}_T$ is the complex amplitude of the transmitted stress wave and $k_2 = \\omega / c_{P,2}$ is the wavenumber in medium $2$.\n\nThe relationship between normal stress $\\sigma$ and normal particle velocity $v$ for a plane wave is crucial. This can be derived from the 1D equation of motion $\\rho \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}$ and the constitutive law. For a harmonic wave, this leads to a direct proportionality involving the impedance $Z$.\nFor a forward-propagating wave (in the $+x$ direction, like the incident and transmitted waves), the relationship is:\n$$ \\sigma(x,t) = -Z v(x,t) $$\nFor a backward-propagating wave (in the $-x$ direction, like the reflected wave), the relationship is:\n$$ \\sigma(x,t) = +Z v(x,t) $$\n\nAt the interface $x=0$, continuity conditions must be satisfied.

For an outgoing plane wave, traction is proportional to particle velocity. The Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer boundary condition approximates this relationship using impedances derived from one-dimensional ($1\\mathrm{D}$) wave propagation.\n\n1.  **Local Traction-Velocity Relation**: The problem specifies \"dashpots in parallel\" in a local coordinate system $\\{\\mathbf{e}_n, \\mathbf{e}_{t1}, \\mathbf{e}_{t2}\\}$.

The uncoupled, frequency-independent viscous boundary is a poor impedance match and absorbs them inefficiently.\n-   Therefore, option **C** is correct as it provides the right formulation and correctly identifies these key limitations.\n-   Option **A** is incorrect as it describes a stiffness matrix (opposing displacement), not a damping matrix (opposing velocity).\n-   Option **B** is incorrect as it omits the crucial rotation matrix $\\mathbf{R}$.\n-   Option **D** describes a lumped, not consistent, formulation with an inappropriate single coefficient.\n-   Option **E** is incorrect because it incorrectly swaps the P- and S-wave impedances in the $\\mathbf{Z}$ matrix, which is physically wrong.",

The round-trip amplitude reduction factor, $R$, is the product of the attenuation factors for the forward and backward paths:\n$$\nR = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^L k_I(x) dx\\right) \\times \\exp\\left(-\\int_L^0 k_I(x) dx\\right) = \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_0^L k_I(x) dx\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the attenuation coefficient $k_I(x) = \\frac{\\sigma(x)}{2c}$:\n$$\nR = \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_0^L \\frac{\\sigma(x)}{2c} dx\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{c} \\int_0^L \\sigma(x) dx\\right)\n$$\nThe amplitude attenuation in decibels ($A_{\\mathrm{dB}}$) is defined as $A_{\\mathrm{dB}} = -20 \\log_{10} R$. Substituting the expression for $R$:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{dB}} = -20 \\log_{10} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{c} \\int_0^L \\sigma(x) dx\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log_b(a^p) = p \\log_b(a)$ and the change of base formula $\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{\\ln(e)}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{dB}} = -20 \\left(-\\frac{1}{c} \\int_0^L \\sigma(x) dx\\right) \\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{20}{c \\ln(10)} \\int_0^L \\sigma(x) dx\n$$\nNext, we use the specific polynomial damping profile $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_{\\max}\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^{m}$. We compute the integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\sigma(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\sigma_{\\max}\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^{m} dx = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{L^m} \\int_0^L x^m dx\n$$\n$$\n\\int_0^L x^m dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^{m+1}}{m+1} \\right]_0^L = \\frac{L^{m+1}}{m+1}\n$$\nTherefore, the integral of the damping profile is:\n$$\n\\int_0^L \\sigma(x) dx = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{L^m} \\frac{L^{m+1}}{m+1} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} L}{m+1}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{dB}}$ yields the final closed-form relation:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{dB}} = \\frac{20}{c \\ln(10)} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} L}{m+1} \\right)\n$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the minimal PML thickness $L$.\nWe are asked to find the minimal PML thickness $L$ required to achieve a target attenuation of $A_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 60$. To do this, we first rearrange the derived relation to solve for $L$:\n$$\nL = A_{\\mathrm{dB}} \\frac{c \\ln(10) (m+1)}{20 \\sigma_{\\max}}\n$$\nTo find the *minimal* required thickness $L$, we must maximize the attenuation effect for a given thickness. This is achieved by using the maximum permissible value of the damping parameter $\\sigma_{\\max}$. The problem provides the stability-imposed bound $\\sigma_{\\max} \\le 1000\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Thus, we set $\\sigma_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Target attenuation $A_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 60$\n- Wave speed $c = 2000\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Polynomial order $m = 3$\n- Maximum damping $\\sigma_{\\max} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $L$:\n$$\nL = 60 \\cdot \\frac{2000 \\cdot \\ln(10) \\cdot (3+1)}{20 \\cdot 1000}\n$$\n$$\nL = 60 \\cdot \\frac{2000 \\cdot \\ln(10) \\cdot 4}{20000} = 60 \\cdot \\frac{8000 \\cdot \\ln(10)}{20000}\n$$\n$$\nL = 60 \\cdot \\frac{8}{20} \\ln(10) = 60 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} \\ln(10) = 24 \\ln(10)\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value. Using $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nL \\approx 24 \\times 2.302585 = 55.26204\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nL \\approx 55.26\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThis is the minimal PML thickness required to meet the specified attenuation criteria.",
