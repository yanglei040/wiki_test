Within the Haigh-Westergaard stress space, characterize the position of this stress state on the deviatoric plane by computing the Lode angle $\\theta$. Begin from first principles by defining the mean stress $p$, the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$, and the second and third invariants $J_{2}$ and $J_{3}$ of $\\boldsymbol{s}$. Define the shear-equivalent stress $q$ used in computational plasticity, and then determine the Lode angle $\\theta$ based on the invariants.

No rounding instruction is necessary; provide the exact value.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the characterization of a given stress state by computing the Lode angle and interpreting its meaning in the context of classical yield criteria. The solution will proceed by calculating the necessary stress invariants from first principles.\n\nThe given principal Cauchy stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathrm{diag}(120,\\,60,\\,0)$ in units of $\\mathrm{MPa}$. The principal stresses, ordered by convention as $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge \\sigma_3$, are:\n$$ \\sigma_1 = 120 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_2 = 60 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_3 = 0 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nFirst, we compute the mean stress, $p$, which represents the hydrostatic component of the stress tensor. It is defined as the average of the principal stresses:\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{3} (\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{3} (120 + 60 + 0) = \\frac{180}{3} = 60 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nNext, we determine the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{s}$, which represents the portion of the stress tensor that causes shear deformation. It is calculated by subtracting the hydrostatic stress from the total stress tensor:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p \\boldsymbol{I} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity tensor. The principal values of the deviatoric stress tensor, denoted $s_1, s_2, s_3$, are:\n$$ s_1 = \\sigma_1 - p = 120 - 60 = 60 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ s_2 = \\sigma_2 - p = 60 - 60 = 0 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ s_3 = \\sigma_3 - p = 0 - 60 = -60 \\, \\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe deviatoric stress tensor in the principal basis is $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\mathrm{diag}(60,\\,0,\\,-60)$ in $\\mathrm{MPa}$. A necessary check is that the trace of the deviatoric stress tensor is zero: $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{s}) = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 60 + 0 + (-60) = 0$.\n\nThe yield behavior of isotropic materials depends on the invariants of the stress tensor. For pressure-dependent materials, it is convenient to use the invariants of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$ and $J_3$, along with the mean stress $p$.\n\nThe second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_2$, is defined as:\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{s}^2) = \\frac{1}{2} (s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2) $$\nSubstituting the values of the principal deviatoric stresses:\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} (60^2 + 0^2 + (-60)^2) = \\frac{1}{2} (3600 + 0 + 3600) = \\frac{7200}{2} = 3600 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}^2 $$\n\nThe third invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_3$, is defined as the determinant of $\\boldsymbol{s}$:\n$$ J_3 = \\det(\\boldsymbol{s}) = s_1 s_2 s_3 $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ J_3 = (60)(0)(-60) = 0 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}^3 $$\n\nThe shear-equivalent stress, often denoted as $q$ or von Mises equivalent stress, is a measure of the magnitude of the deviatoric stress. It is defined in terms of $J_2$:\n$$ q = \\sqrt{3 J_2} $$\nFor the given stress state:\n$$ q = \\sqrt{3 \\times 3600} = \\sqrt{10800} = 60\\sqrt{3} \\, \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nThe Lode angle, $\\theta$, characterizes the mode of shear deformation and determines the shape of the yield surface on the deviatoric plane (the $\\pi$-plane). A common definition relates $\\theta$ to the invariants $J_2$ and $J_3$ via:\n$$ \\cos(3\\theta) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\frac{J_3}{(J_2)^{3/2}} $$\nFor this definition, a value of $\\theta=0$ corresponds to a state of triaxial compression ($\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3$), while $\\theta=\\pi/3$ corresponds to triaxial extension ($\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 > \\sigma_3$).\n\nUsing our calculated values for $J_2$ and $J_3$:\n$$ \\cos(3\\theta) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\frac{0}{(3600)^{3/2}} = 0 $$\nTo solve for $\\theta$, we find the angle whose cosine is $0$:\n$$ 3\\theta = \\arccos(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nTherefore, the Lode angle is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\, \\mathrm{rad} $$\nThis calculated value lies within the range $[0, \\pi/6]$ specified in the problem statement.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. The Lode angle $\\theta = \\pi/6$ corresponds to the condition $J_3 = 0$, which signifies a state of pure shear in the deviatoric sense ($s_2 = 0$).\n\nOn the deviatoric plane in Haigh-Westergaard stress space:\n- For the **Drucker-Prager** model, the yield surface is a circle. This means the yield stress is independent of the Lode angle. The stress state's location is on this circle, but its angular position at $\\theta=\\pi/6$ holds no special significance relative to the yield criterion itself.\n- For the **Mohr-Coulomb** model, the yield surface is an irregular hexagon. The vertices of the hexagon correspond to triaxial states. The \"compressive\" vertices lie on meridians where $\\theta = 0, 2\\pi/3, 4\\pi/3$, and the \"tensile\" vertices lie on meridians where $\\theta = \\pi/3, \\pi, 5\\pi/3$. The lines connecting these vertices are the edges of the hexagon.\nOur calculated Lode angle $\\theta = \\pi/6$ places the stress state exactly on the meridian bisecting the angle between the triaxial compression meridian ($\\theta=0$) and the triaxial extension meridian ($\\theta=\\pi/3$). This position corresponds to the **midpoint of an edge** of the Mohr-Coulomb hexagon.",

The material is intended to represent a geomaterial idealized by a $J_{2}$ (von Mises) yield surface with associated flow.

The solution involves first establishing the relationship between the uniaxial yield stress $\\sigma_{y}$ and the von Mises criterion, and then applying the principles of computational plasticity, specifically the return mapping algorithm, to determine the plastic strain that develops during a given stress increment.\n\nFirst, we derive the von Mises yield condition for a state of uniaxial tension.\nThe stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ for a uniaxial tensile stress of magnitude $\\sigma_{xx}$ applied along the $x$-axis is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{xx}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe hydrostatic stress, or mean stress, $p$, is one-third of the trace of the stress tensor:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_{xx} + 0 + 0) = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx}\n$$\nThe deviatoric stress tensor, $\\mathbf{s}$, is defined as $\\mathbf{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p\\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor.\n$$\n\\mathbf{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{xx}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx}  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx}  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_{xx}  0  0 \\\\ 0  -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx}  0 \\\\ 0  0  -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_{2}$, is defined as $J_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij}s_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{s}^2)$.\n$$\nJ_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_{xx}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{4}{9}\\sigma_{xx}^2 + \\frac{1}{9}\\sigma_{xx}^2 + \\frac{1}{9}\\sigma_{xx}^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{6}{9}\\sigma_{xx}^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx}^2\n$$\nThe von Mises yield function, $f$, is given by $f = \\sigma_{\\text{eq}} - \\sigma_{y}$, where $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}$ is the equivalent stress, defined as $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}} = \\sqrt{3J_{2}}$. At the onset of yielding, $f=0$.\n$$\n\\sqrt{3J_{2}} = \\sigma_{y} \\implies \\sqrt{3 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{xx}^2\\right)} = \\sigma_{y} \\implies \\sqrt{\\sigma_{xx}^2} = \\sigma_{y}\n$$\nFor tension, $\\sigma_{xx} > 0$, so we have $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{y}$.

The corresponding equivalent stress is $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}, n} = 15\\,\\text{MPa}$. Since $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}, n}  \\sigma_{y}$ ($15\\,\\text{MPa}  22\\,\\text{MPa}$), the material is in the elastic region.\n\nAn axial stress increment of $\\Delta\\sigma = 12\\,\\text{MPa}$ is applied. We first compute the \"elastic trial\" stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}$, which is the stress state that would be reached if the material response were purely elastic.\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{tr}} = \\sigma_{xx,n} + \\Delta\\sigma = 15\\,\\text{MPa} + 12\\,\\text{MPa} = 27\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe trial stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 27  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\nWe now check if this trial stress state violates the yield criterion. We calculate the trial equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}}$. Based on our derivation above, for uniaxial stress, this is simply the axial component:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} = 27\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe yield function for the trial state is:\n$$\nf^{\\text{tr}} = \\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}} - \\sigma_{y} = 27\\,\\text{MPa} - 22\\,\\text{MPa} = 5\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nSince $f^{\\text{tr}} > 0$, the elastic trial state lies outside the yield surface, which is not physically permissible. Therefore, plastic deformation must occur during the increment.\n\n**Step 2: Plastic Corrector Step (Return Mapping)**\nFor an elastic-perfectly plastic material, the final stress state, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}$, must lie on the yield surface. The return mapping algorithm updates the trial stress to find this final state. For the $J_{2}$ yield criterion, this is a \"radial return,\" meaning the deviatoric part of the trial stress, $\\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}}$, is scaled back radially to the yield surface.\n\nLet's compute the trial deviatoric stress $\\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}}$:\nThe trial hydrostatic stress is $p^{\\text{tr}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}) = \\frac{1}{3}(27\\,\\text{MPa}) = 9\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}} - p^{\\text{tr}}\\mathbf{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} 27-9  0  0 \\\\ 0  0-9  0 \\\\ 0  0  0-9 \\end{pmatrix}\\,\\text{MPa} = \\begin{pmatrix} 18  0  0 \\\\ 0  -9  0 \\\\ 0  0  -9 \\end{pmatrix}\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe final deviatoric stress, $\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}$, is found by scaling $\\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}}$ such that the corresponding equivalent stress is equal to $\\sigma_{y}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}_{n+1} = \\frac{\\sigma_{y}}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}}} \\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}}\n$$\nThe plastic strain increment, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}$, is related to the trial and final deviatoric stresses via the elastic constitutive law for the deviatoric components:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}} - 2G \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}\n$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the plastic strain increment:\n$$\n\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p} = \\frac{\\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}} - \\mathbf{s}_{n+1}}{2G}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p} = \\frac{1}{2G} \\left( \\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}} - \\frac{\\sigma_{y}}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}}} \\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}} \\right) = \\frac{\\mathbf{s}^{\\text{tr}}}{2G} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sigma_{y}}{\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}^{\\text{tr}}} \\right)\n$$\nThis formula provides the tensor of plastic strain increments.

The stress tensor is constant: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\text{diag}(\\sigma_y, 0, 0)$.\nSince the stress is constant, the elastic strain is also constant:\n$$ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^e = \\mathbf{C}^{-1} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe rate of total strain is therefore equal to the rate of plastic strain:\n$$ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^e + \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p $$\nThus, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p_{11}$. Since loading continues ($\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11}  0$), we have $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p_{11}  0$.\nThe plastic flow is governed by the flow rule. At yield, the deviatoric stress is $\\mathbf{s} = \\text{diag}(\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_y, -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_y, -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_y)$ and $\\sqrt{J_2} = \\sigma_y/\\sqrt{3}$.\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p_{11} = \\dot{\\gamma} \\frac{s_{11}}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} = \\dot{\\gamma} \\frac{2\\sigma_y/3}{2\\sigma_y/\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p_{11}$, we get $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11} = \\dot{\\gamma}/\\sqrt{3}$, which implies $\\dot{\\gamma} = \\sqrt{3}\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11}$. Since $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11}  0$, we have $\\dot{\\gamma}  0$.\nLet's verify the KKT conditions for this stage:\n1. $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_y - \\sigma_y = 0$. Admissibility holds.\n2. $\\dot{\\gamma} = \\sqrt{3}\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11}  0$. Non-negativity holds.\n3. $\\dot{\\gamma} f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\dot{\\gamma} \\cdot 0 = 0$. Complementarity holds.\n4. With $\\dot{\\gamma}0$, the consistency condition $\\dot{f}=0$ must hold. Since the stress is constant $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}=\\mathbf{0}$, $\\dot{f} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = 0$ is trivially satisfied.\nAll KKT conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Stage 3: Elastic unloading**\nAt $\\varepsilon_{11} = \\varepsilon_{\\max} = 0.035$, the loading direction is reversed ($\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11}  0$).\nThe state at the point of reversal is $\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_y$, $\\varepsilon_{11} = \\varepsilon_{\\max}$, and some accumulated plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p_{11}(\\varepsilon_{\\max})$.\nUpon reversal, the response is elastic. The change in stress $\\Delta\\sigma_{11}$ is related to the change in total strain $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{11} = \\varepsilon_{11} - \\varepsilon_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{11} = E \\Delta\\varepsilon_{11} = E(\\varepsilon_{11} - \\varepsilon_{\\max}) $$\nThe stress during unloading is $\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_y + \\Delta\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_y + E(\\varepsilon_{11} - \\varepsilon_{\\max})$.\nSince $\\varepsilon_{11}  \\varepsilon_{\\max}$, $\\Delta\\sigma_{11}  0$, and thus $\\sigma_{11}  \\sigma_y$.\nThe yield function becomes $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_{11} - \\sigma_y  0$.\nVerification of KKT conditions during unloading:\n1. $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})  0$. Admissibility holds.\n2. The complementarity condition $\\dot{\\gamma} f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 0$ requires $\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$.\n3. $\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$ satisfies the non-negativity condition.\n4. With $\\dot{\\gamma}=0$, the flow rule gives $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p = \\mathbf{0}$. No further plastic strain accumulates.\nThe KKT conditions are satisfied, and the unloading process is purely elastic. The plastic strain remains \"frozen\" at the value it had at $\\varepsilon_{11} = \\varepsilon_{\\max}$.\n\n**Task 2: Evolution of Axial Plastic Strain $\\varepsilon^p_{11}$**\nBased on the three stages analyzed above:\n- For $0 \\le \\varepsilon_{11} \\le \\varepsilon_{11,y} = \\sigma_y/E$:\nThe response is purely elastic, so no plastic strain accumulates.\n$$ \\varepsilon^p_{11}(\\varepsilon_{11}) = 0 $$\n- For $\\varepsilon_{11,y}  \\varepsilon_{11} \\le \\varepsilon_{\\max}$:\nPlastic strain develops. We have $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p_{11} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11}$. We integrate this from the onset of yield ($\\varepsilon_{11,y}, \\varepsilon^p_{11}=0$) to a generic state ($\\varepsilon_{11}, \\varepsilon^p_{11}$):\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\varepsilon^p_{11}} d\\varepsilon'^p_{11} = \\int_{\\varepsilon_{11,y}}^{\\varepsilon_{11}} d\\varepsilon'_{11} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon^p_{11}(\\varepsilon_{11}) = \\varepsilon_{11} - \\varepsilon_{11,y} = \\varepsilon_{11} - \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} $$\n- During the unloading path starting from $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$:\nThe plastic strain rate is zero, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p_{11} = 0$. The plastic strain is constant and equal to its value at the point of reversal:\n$$ \\varepsilon^p_{11} = \\varepsilon^p_{11}(\\varepsilon_{\\max}) = \\varepsilon_{\\max} - \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} $$\n\n**Task 3: Computation of Permanent Axial Strain**\nThe permanent axial strain is the strain that remains when the specimen is fully unloaded, i.e., when $\\sigma_{11} = 0$. Let this final state be denoted by subscript $f$.\nThe total final strain is $\\varepsilon_{11,f} = \\varepsilon^e_{11,f} + \\varepsilon^p_{11,f}$.\nThe final elastic strain is $\\varepsilon^e_{11,f} = \\frac{\\sigma_{11,f}}{E} = \\frac{0}{E} = 0$.\nTherefore, the final total strain is equal to the final plastic strain: $\\varepsilon_{11,f} = \\varepsilon^p_{11,f}$. This is the permanent strain.\nFrom Task 2, the plastic strain throughout unloading is constant, so the permanent strain is the plastic strain accumulated up to $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$.\n$$ \\varepsilon^p_{\\text{perm}} = \\varepsilon_{\\max} - \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ E = 100 \\text{ MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_y = 2 \\text{ MPa} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\max} = 0.035 $$\nThe yield strain is $\\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02$.\nSince $\\varepsilon_{\\max} = 0.035  0.02$, plastic deformation occurs as established.\nThe permanent axial strain is:\n$$ \\varepsilon^p_{\\text{perm}} = 0.035 - 0.02 = 0.015 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.01500$.",
