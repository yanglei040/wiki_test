            "problem": "Consider a soil element subjected to a three-dimensional Cauchy stress state with components (expressed under the compressive-positive geomechanics sign convention and assuming negligible pore pressure so that total stress equals effective stress): $\\sigma_{xx}=150$, $\\sigma_{yy}=100$, $\\sigma_{zz}=50$, $\\sigma_{xy}=20$, $\\sigma_{yz}=0$, $\\sigma_{zx}=10$ (all in $\\mathrm{kPa}$).

Express your final numerical values for $p$ and $q$ in $\\mathrm{kPa}$. Provide exact values; no rounding is required. Your final answer must consist only of the pair $(p,q)$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the stress invariants $p$ and $q$ for a given Cauchy stress state and an interpretation of their roles in cap plasticity. The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant stress invariants based on the provided three-dimensional Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. Under the specified compressive-positive sign convention and the assumption that total stress equals effective stress, the stress tensor is given by its components:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{xx}  \\sigma_{xy}  \\sigma_{zx} \\\\ \\sigma_{yx}  \\sigma_{yy}  \\sigma_{yz} \\\\ \\sigma_{xz}  \\sigma_{zy}  \\sigma_{zz} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 150  20  10 \\\\ 20  100  0 \\\\ 10  0  50 \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\nNote that $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$, consistent with the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor.\n\nThe first stress invariant required is the mean stress, $p$. It is defined as the average of the normal stress components, representing the hydrostatic component of the stress state.\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3} (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3} (150 + 100 + 50) \\, \\mathrm{kPa} = \\frac{1}{3} (300) \\, \\mathrm{kPa} = 100 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\n\nThe second required invariant is the deviatoric stress measure, $q$. This quantity represents the magnitude of the shear or distortional component of the stress state. It is defined in terms of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$. The deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{s}$, is obtained by subtracting the hydrostatic stress component from the total stress tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p \\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. The components of $\\boldsymbol{s}$ are:\n$s_{xx} = \\sigma_{xx} - p = 150 - 100 = 50 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$\n$s_{yy} = \\sigma_{yy} - p = 100 - 100 = 0 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$\n$s_{zz} = \\sigma_{zz} - p = 50 - 100 = -50 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$\nThe shear components of $\\boldsymbol{s}$ are identical to those of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$s_{xy} = \\sigma_{xy} = 20 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$\n$s_{yz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$\n$s_{zx} = \\sigma_{zx} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$\n\nThe second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$, is defined as:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij} s_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{s}^2)\n$$\nIn component form, this is:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{2} (s_{xx}^2 + s_{yy}^2 + s_{zz}^2 + 2s_{xy}^2 + 2s_{yz}^2 + 2s_{zx}^2)\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated components of $\\boldsymbol{s}$:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{2} [ (50)^2 + (0)^2 + (-50)^2 + 2(20)^2 + 2(0)^2 + 2(10)^2 ] \\, \\mathrm{kPa}^2\n$$\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{2} [ 2500 + 0 + 2500 + 2(400) + 0 + 2(100) ] \\, \\mathrm{kPa}^2\n$$\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{2} [ 5000 + 800 + 200 ] \\, \\mathrm{kPa}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} [6000] \\, \\mathrm{kPa}^2 = 3000 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}^2\n$$\nThe deviatoric stress measure, $q$, commonly used in critical state soil mechanics and related cap plasticity models, is defined as:\n$$\nq = \\sqrt{3 J_2}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $J_2$:\n$$\nq = \\sqrt{3 \\times 3000} \\, \\mathrm{kPa} = \\sqrt{9000} \\, \\mathrm{kPa} = \\sqrt{900 \\times 10} \\, \\mathrm{kPa} = 30\\sqrt{10} \\, \\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\nThe computed values are $p = 100 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$ and $q = 30\\sqrt{10} \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$.\n\nNext, we interpret the roles of $p$ and $q$ in the context of cap plasticity.\nIn geomechanics, the stress state of a soil element is conveniently represented in the $p$-$q$ stress space.\n\nThe mean stress, $p$, is a measure of the confining pressure on the soil element. An increase in $p$ (at constant $q$) corresponds to an isotropic compression, which tends to cause a decrease in the soil's volume, a process known as compaction. In cap plasticity models, a yield surface, known as the \"cap,\" is defined in the high-compressive-stress region of the $p$-$q$ space. This cap sets the limit for elastic behavior under compressive loading. When the stress state reaches the cap, plastic volumetric strain (compaction) occurs. The position of the cap is not fixed; it expands as the soil undergoes plastic compaction. This expansion is a form of hardening, specifically volumetric hardening, where the material becomes stiffer and can sustain higher mean stresses before further yielding. The position of the cap is typically controlled by an internal state variable, such as the accumulated plastic volumetric strain, $\\varepsilon_v^p$.\n\nThe deviatoric stress measure, $q$, is a measure of the intensity of shear stress. It is analogous to the von Mises equivalent stress in metal plasticity. An increase in $q$ (at constant $p$) corresponds to an increase in shear, which tends to cause distortion or change in shape of the soil element at constant volume. In plasticity models, there is a shear failure surface (for example, a Drucker-Prager cone or a critical state line) that defines the maximum shear stress $q$ the material can sustain for a given confining pressure $p$. When the stress state reaches this surface, the material yields primarily in shear, leading to plastic shear strains.\n\nCap plasticity models integrate these two concepts. A complete yield surface consists of a shear failure surface and an intersecting compaction cap. The cap limits the purely elastic domain for high mean pressures, preventing unrealistic elastic behavior under large confinements, which is a flaw in models without a cap. The combination of $p$ and $q$ determines the soil's response. For a loading path that increases both $p$ and $q$, the soil may experience both plastic compaction (volumetric hardening as the cap expands) and shear-induced distortion. The flow rule associated with the cap yield surface dictates that yielding on the cap produces plastic volumetric strains, representing compaction. The flow rule for the shear failure surface typically predicts plastic shear strains and can also predict plastic volumetric strains (either compaction or dilation), known as shear-compaction or shear-dilation coupling. Thus, $p$ primarily governs volumetric change and compaction hardening, while $q$ primarily governs shear distortion and shear failure, with the cap model providing a unified framework for their interaction.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of the Modified Cam-Clay (MCC) yield function, $f$, for a given stress state. The MCC model is a critical state model that defines an elliptical yield surface in the $p$-$q$ stress space. The yield function defines the boundary of the elastic domain.\n\nThe equation for the MCC yield surface is given by:\n$$ f(p, q, p_c) = q^2 + M^2 p (p - p_c) $$\nwhere $q$ is the deviatoric stress, $p$ is the mean effective stress, $M$ is the slope of the critical state line in the $p$-$q$ plane, and $p_c$ is the preconsolidation pressure, which acts as the hardening parameter.\n\nThe state of the material is determined by the value of the yield function $f$:\n-   If $f  0$, the stress state is inside the yield surface, and the material behaves elastically.\n-   If $f = 0$, the stress state is on the yield surface, indicating the onset of plastic deformation.\n-   If $f > 0$, the stress state is outside the yield surface, which is an inadmissible state for standard rate-independent elastoplasticity.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Deviatoric stress: $q = 100 \\text{ kPa}$\n-   Mean effective stress: $p = 250 \\text{ kPa}$\n-   Critical state ratio: $M = 1.2$\n-   Preconsolidation pressure: $p_c = 300 \\text{ kPa}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the yield function equation. For consistency, all stress values are used in units of kPa. The resulting value for $f$ will be in units of $\\text{kPa}^2$.\n\n$$ f = (100)^2 + (1.2)^2 \\times (250) \\times (250 - 300) $$\n$$ f = 10000 + (1.44) \\times (250) \\times (-50) $$\nFirst, we calculate the product of the last two terms:\n$$ (1.44) \\times (250) \\times (-50) = 1.44 \\times (-12500) $$\n$$ 1.44 \\times (-12500) = -18000 $$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the equation for $f$:\n$$ f = 10000 - 18000 $$\n$$ f = -8000 $$\nThe units of $f$ are $\\text{kPa}^2$. Thus, $f = -8000 \\text{ kPa}^2$.\n\nSince $f = -8000 \\text{ kPa}^2$, which is less than $0$, the stress state $(p=250 \\text{ kPa}, q=100 \\text{ kPa})$ is inside the elastic domain. The material response at this point is purely elastic.\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is an exact integer, $-8000$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it in standard scientific notation.\n$$ f = -8.000 \\times 10^3 \\text{ kPa}^2 $$\nThis value satisfies the stated rounding requirement.",

The parameter values are physically realistic for clayey soils. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\n**Derivation of the Isotropic Hardening Relation**\n\nThe hardening law describes the evolution of the yield surface size, represented by the preconsolidation pressure $p_c$, as a function of plastic deformation. In the MCC model, the preconsolidation pressure hardens isotropically with the accumulation of plastic volumetric strain, $\\varepsilon_v^p$.\n\nWe consider a process of virgin isotropic consolidation. During this process, the soil is yielding, and the stress state lies on the current yield surface. For isotropic loading, the stress state is described solely by the mean effective stress $p$. The yield condition is thus $p = p_c$.\n\nAs loading proceeds along the Normal Consolidation Line (NCL), the total volumetric strain increment, $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v$, is given by the problem statement as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v = \\lambda\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p)\n$$\nDuring this virgin consolidation, the soil yields and hardens. The consistency condition requires that the stress point remains on the yield surface, which means that an increment in mean effective stress $\\mathrm{d}p$ must be accompanied by an identical increment in the preconsolidation pressure $\\mathrm{d}p_c$. Thus, $\\mathrm{d}p = \\mathrm{d}p_c$, which implies $\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p) = \\mathrm{d}(\\ln p_c)$. The total strain increment $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v$ can then be expressed in terms of the hardening variable $p_c$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v = \\lambda\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p_c)\n$$\nThe total strain increment $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v$ is composed of an elastic part $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^e$ and a plastic part $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^p$, according to the additive decomposition:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v = \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^e + \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^p\n$$\nThe elastic part of the volumetric strain increment is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^e = \\kappa\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p) = \\kappa\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p_c)\n$$\nBy substituting the expressions for $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^e$ into the strain decomposition equation, we can solve for the plastic volumetric strain increment $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^p$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^p = \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v - \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^e = \\lambda\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p_c) - \\kappa\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p_c)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the fundamental relationship between the plastic volumetric strain increment and the change in the preconsolidation pressure:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^p = (\\lambda - \\kappa)\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p_c)\n$$\nThis equation represents the differential form of the isotropic hardening law. To express the increment of preconsolidation pressure $\\mathrm{d}p_c$ as a function of the plastic strain increment $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^p$, we use the chain rule, $\\mathrm{d}(\\ln p_c) = \\frac{1}{p_c}\\mathrm{d}p_c$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^p = (\\lambda - \\kappa) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_c}{p_c}\n$$\nRearranging this provides the explicit differential hardening relation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}p_c = \\frac{p_c}{\\lambda - \\kappa} \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_v^p\n$$\n\n**Integration of the Hardening Law**\n\nTo find the updated preconsolidation pressure after a finite plastic volumetric strain increment, we must integrate the differential form of the hardening law.
