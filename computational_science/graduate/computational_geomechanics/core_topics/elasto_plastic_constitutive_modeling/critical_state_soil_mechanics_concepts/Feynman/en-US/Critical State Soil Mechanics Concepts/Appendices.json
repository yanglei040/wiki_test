Second, we use this relationship and the given data to compute the updated preconsolidation pressure and the corresponding shift in the yield surface center.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Hardening Rule**\n\nThe fundamental assumption of plasticity is the decomposition of the total strain increment into an elastic part and a plastic part. For volumetric strains, this is written as:\n$$\nd\\epsilon_{v} = d\\epsilon_{v}^{e} + d\\epsilon_{v}^{p}\n$$\nThe problem defines $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa$ as the slopes of the volumetric strain versus $\\ln p'$ relationship for virgin compression and elastic unloading/reloading, respectively.\nThe elastic behavior is governed by $\\kappa$:\n$$\nd\\epsilon_{v}^{e} = \\kappa \\, d(\\ln p') = \\kappa \\frac{dp'}{p'}\n$$\nFor a state on the virgin Normal Consolidation Line (NCL), the total incremental volumetric strain is governed by $\\lambda$:\n$$\nd\\epsilon_{v} = \\lambda \\, d(\\ln p') = \\lambda \\frac{dp'}{p'}\n$$\nThe plastic volumetric strain increment is the difference between the total and elastic increments:\n$$\nd\\epsilon_{v}^{p} = d\\epsilon_{v} - d\\epsilon_{v}^{e} = (\\lambda - \\kappa) \\frac{dp'}{p'} = (\\lambda - \\kappa) d(\\ln p')\n$$\nThe hardening of the material, represented by the evolution of the preconsolidation pressure $p'_{c}$, is driven by plastic volumetric straining. For the MCC model under isotropic loading ($q=0$), the yield condition $f=0$ implies that $p' = p'_{c}$. This means that during virgin isotropic plastic loading, the mean effective stress is equal to the preconsolidation pressure. Therefore, any incremental change in stress corresponds to a change in the hardening variable, i.e., $d(\\ln p') = d(\\ln p'_{c})$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the plastic volumetric strain increment, we obtain the hardening rule for this simplified MCC model:\n$$\nd\\epsilon_{v}^{p} = (\\lambda - \\kappa) d(\\ln p'_{c})\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the desired relation for the incremental change in the hardening variable:\n$$\nd\\ln p'_{c} = \\frac{d\\epsilon_{v}^{p}}{\\lambda - \\kappa}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Updated State**\n\nWe are given the following values: $\\lambda = 0.2$, $\\kappa = 0.05$, $p'_{c,\\text{old}} = 300$ kPa, and $d\\epsilon_{v}^{p} = 0.01$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the incremental change in the log of the preconsolidation pressure using the derived formula:\n$$\nd\\ln p'_{c} = \\frac{0.01}{0.2 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.01}{0.15} = \\frac{1}{15}\n$$\nNext, we compute the updated preconsolidation pressure, $p'_{c,\\text{new}}$, using the provided update rule $p'_{c,\\text{new}} = p'_{c,\\text{old}} \\exp(d\\ln p'_{c})$:\n$$\np'_{c,\\text{new}} = 300 \\text{ kPa} \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\right) \\approx 300 \\times 1.0689414 \\approx 320.6824 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\np'_{c,\\text{new}} = 320.7 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the horizontal shift of the yield surface center, which is located at $p' = p'_{c}/2$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\left(\\frac{p'_{c}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{p'_{c,\\text{new}} - p'_{c,\\text{old}}}{2} = \\frac{320.6824 - 300}{2} \\text{ kPa} = \\frac{20.6824}{2} \\text{ kPa} \\approx 10.3412 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta\\left(\\frac{p'_{c}}{2}\\right) = 10.34 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nThe two requested quantities are the updated preconsolidation pressure and the shift of the yield surface center.",
