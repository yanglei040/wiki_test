            "solution": "**Task 1: Derivation of the expected number of candidate peptides per spectrum, $N_{\\mathrm{cand}}(s)$**\n\nThe expected number of candidate peptides per spectrum, $N_{\\mathrm{cand}}(s)$, is determined by three main factors: the total number of potential peptides (substrings) in the proteome, the filtering effect of the precursor mass tolerance window, and the filtering effect of the enzyme specificity constraint.\n\n1.  **Total number of substrings in the mass window (non-specific case):**\n    For a given precursor mass $M_{0}$ and mass tolerance $\\Delta$, a peptide is a candidate if its length $\\ell$ falls within a specific range. The condition is given as $|\\bar{m}\\,\\ell - M_{0}| \\le \\Delta$, where $\\bar{m}$ is the mean residue mass. This inequality can be rewritten as $-\\Delta \\le \\bar{m}\\,\\ell - M_{0} \\le \\Delta$, or $\\frac{M_{0}-\\Delta}{\\bar{m}} \\le \\ell \\le \\frac{M_{0}+\\Delta}{\\bar{m}}$. The total range of allowed lengths is $(\\frac{M_{0}+\\Delta}{\\bar{m}}) - (\\frac{M_{0}-\\Delta}{\\bar{m}}) = \\frac{2\\Delta}{\\bar{m}}$.\n    The problem states that in the narrow-window regime, the expected number of eligible integer lengths $\\ell$ is approximated by this value, let's call it $L = \\frac{2\\Delta}{\\bar{m}}$.\n\n    For each eligible length $\\ell$, the number of contiguous substrings of that length in a proteome of size $G$ is approximately $G$ (ignoring end effects, where the number would be $G - \\ell + 1$). The problem directs us to use the approximation $G$.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of substrings that fall into the precursor mass window, without any enzymatic specificity constraint, is the product of the number of eligible lengths and the number of substrings per length:\n    $$ N_{\\text{total substrings in window}} \\approx G \\times L = G \\frac{2\\Delta}{\\bar{m}} $$\n    This corresponds to the non-specific case where $s=0$.\n\n2.  **Incorporating enzyme specificity:**\n    The specificity constraint requires a candidate peptide to have a certain number of enzymatic termini. The parameter $s \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ defines the minimum number of required enzymatic termini. A substring is defined by its start and end positions in the proteome. An enzymatic terminus corresponds to the residue just before the start of the peptide being a cleavage site, or the residue at the end of the peptide being a cleavage site. The problem models these two events as independent Bernoulli trials, each with a probability $q$ of being an enzymatic site.\n\n    The fraction of substrings that satisfy the specificity constraint $s$ is given by $f_{s}(q)$, where:\n    $$ f_{s}(q) = \\sum_{k=s}^{2} \\binom{2}{k}\\, q^{k}\\, (1-q)^{2-k} $$\n    This function represents the probability that a randomly chosen substring has at least $s$ enzymatic termini.\n\n3.  **Final expression for $N_{\\mathrm{cand}}(s)$:**\n    The expected number of candidate peptides for a given specificity $s$, $N_{\\mathrm{cand}}(s)$, is the total number of substrings in the mass window multiplied by the fraction of those substrings that satisfy the specificity constraint. This expression represents the number of candidates generated from the target proteome.\n    $$ N_{\\mathrm{cand}}(s) = (\\text{Total substrings in window}) \\times f_{s}(q) $$\n    Substituting the expressions derived above, we get:\n    $$ N_{\\mathrm{cand}}(s) = \\frac{2G\\Delta}{\\bar{m}} f_{s}(q) $$\n    This is the desired expression for the expected number of candidate peptides per spectrum as a function of $G$, $\\Delta$, $\\bar{m}$, $q$, and $s$.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of the score threshold $t_{s}$**\n\nThe goal is to find a score threshold $t_s$ for a search with specificity $s$ such that the expected number of null exceedances per spectrum, $\\Lambda(s, t_s)$, is equal to a baseline value, $\\Lambda(2, t_2)$, from a fully specific ($s=2$) search.\n\n1.  **Expected number of null exceedances $\\Lambda(s, t)$:**\n    The expected number of null exceedances is the product of the total number of null trials (i.e., scored peptides that are incorrect matches) and the probability that a null score exceeds the threshold $t$.\n    $$ \\Lambda(s, t) = N_{\\mathrm{null}}(s) \\times p_{0}(t) $$\n    The problem specifies a decoy-to-target ratio of $1:1$. This means the total search space consists of candidates from the target proteome and an equally sized set of candidates from a decoy database. Thus, the total number of candidates being scored is twice the number derived from the target proteome: $N_{\\mathrm{total}}(s) = 2 N_{\\mathrm{cand}}(s)$.\n    It is a standard assumption in proteomics FDR estimation that the number of correct matches is negligible compared to the number of incorrect matches. Therefore, we approximate the number of null trials, $N_{\\mathrm{null}}(s)$, by the total number of candidates, $N_{\\mathrm{total}}(s)$.\n    $$ N_{\\mathrm{null}}(s) \\approx 2 N_{\\mathrm{cand}}(s) = 2 \\left( \\frac{2G\\Delta}{\\bar{m}} f_{s}(q) \\right) = \\frac{4G\\Delta}{\\bar{m}} f_{s}(q) $$\n    The probability of a null score exceeding a threshold $t$ is given as $p_{0}(t) = \\exp(-\\beta t)$.\n    Combining these, the expected number of null exceedances for specificity $s$ and threshold $t_s$ is:\n    $$ \\Lambda(s, t_s) = \\left( \\frac{4G\\Delta}{\\bar{m}} f_{s}(q) \\right) \\exp(-\\beta t_s) $$\n\n2.  **Equating null exceedances:**\n    We are required to set $\\Lambda(s, t_s) = \\Lambda(2, t_2)$.\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{4G\\Delta}{\\bar{m}} f_{s}(q) \\right) \\exp(-\\beta t_s) = \\left( \\frac{4G\\Delta}{\\bar{m}} f_{2}(q) \\right) \\exp(-\\beta t_2) $$\n    The constant pre-factor $\\frac{4G\\Delta}{\\bar{m}}$ appears on both sides and can be cancelled, as it is non-zero.\n    $$ f_{s}(q) \\exp(-\\beta t_s) = f_{2}(q) \\exp(-\\beta t_2) $$\n\n3.  **Solving for $t_{s}$:**\n    We rearrange the equation to solve for $t_s$.\n    $$ \\exp(-\\beta t_s) = \\frac{f_{2}(q)}{f_{s}(q)} \\exp(-\\beta t_2) $$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$ \\ln(\\exp(-\\beta t_s)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{2}(q)}{f_{s}(q)} \\exp(-\\beta t_2)\\right) $$\n    $$ -\\beta t_s = \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{2}(q)}{f_{s}(q)}\\right) + \\ln(\\exp(-\\beta t_2)) $$\n    $$ -\\beta t_s = \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{2}(q)}{f_{s}(q)}\\right) - \\beta t_2 $$\n    Dividing by $-\\beta$ (since $\\beta > 0$):\n    $$ t_s = t_2 - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{2}(q)}{f_{s}(q)}\\right) $$\n    Using the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, we can write this as:\n    $$ t_s = t_2 + \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{s}(q)}{f_{2}(q)}\\right) $$\n    Finally, we substitute the given expressions for $f_{s}(q)$ and $f_{2}(q)$.\n    $f_{2}(q) = \\sum_{k=2}^{2} \\binom{2}{k} q^k (1-q)^{2-k} = \\binom{2}{2} q^2 (1-q)^0 = q^2$.\n    The general expression for $f_s(q)$ is $\\sum_{k=s}^{2} \\binom{2}{k}\\, q^{k}\\, (1-q)^{2-k}$.\n    This yields the final expression for $t_s$ in terms of $t_2$, $\\beta$, $q$, and $s$.\n    $$ t_s = t_2 + \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\sum_{k=s}^{2} \\binom{2}{k}\\, q^{k}\\, (1-q)^{2-k}}{q^2} \\right) $$\nAs a check, for $s=2$, the sum in the numerator becomes $\\binom{2}{2}q^2(1-q)^0 = q^2$. The argument of the logarithm is $\\frac{q^2}{q^2}=1$, and $\\ln(1)=0$, so $t_2 = t_2$, which is correct. For $s<2$, the numerator is a sum of positive terms including $q^2$, so the fraction is greater than $1$, its logarithm is positive, and thus $t_s > t_2$. This is expected, as a less specific search ($s<2$) generates more candidates, requiring a higher score threshold to maintain the same number of chance exceedances.",
