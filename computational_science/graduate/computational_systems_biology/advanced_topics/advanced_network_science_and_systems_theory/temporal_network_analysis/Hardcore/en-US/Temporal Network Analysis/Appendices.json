Unlike in static networks, connectivity depends not only on the existence of links but also on their precise timing. This exercise  challenges you to manually trace the flow of information through a small network by processing events chronologically, providing a concrete intuition for how causality and waiting periods combine to determine the earliest possible arrival time between two nodes.",

            "problem": "Consider a directed temporal network in discrete time with node set $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ and a contact sequence (temporal edges) given by the set of events $\\{(A,B,1),(A,C,2),(C,B,3),(C,D,4),(B,D,5)\\}$, where an event $(X,Y,t)$ denotes a directed contact enabling instantaneous traversal from node $X$ to node $Y$ at time $t$. Assume the standard temporal expansion in which for every node $v \\in \\{A,B,C,D\\}$ and every integer time $t$, a unit-time waiting transition from $(v,t)$ to $(v,t+1)$ is available; that is, waiting at a node is allowed and increases time by exactly $1$ per unit waited.\n\nYou start at node $A$ at time $t=0$. A time-respecting path is defined as a sequence of directed event traversals $(v_{0},v_{1},t_{1}), (v_{1},v_{2},t_{2}), \\dots, (v_{k-1},v_{k},t_{k})$ such that $t_{i+1} \\geq t_{i}$ for all $i$, and any gaps in time between successive events are bridged by waiting transitions of unit duration at the appropriate node. The earliest arrival time at a target node is the minimum $t$ such that the target node is reachable at time $t$ by a time-respecting path from the source.\n\nUsing only the above foundational definitions, compute the earliest arrival time from $A$ at $t=0$ to $D$. Additionally, list all distinct time-respecting paths (as sequences of event traversals, ignoring waiting transitions) that achieve this earliest arrival time, and justify that no path can arrive earlier under the given event set and waiting model. Express the earliest arrival time in integer time steps; no rounding is necessary.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the earliest arrival time at a target node in a temporal network, starting from a given source node and time. This is a shortest path problem on a time-dependent graph. The network consists of a set of nodes $V = \\{A, B, C, D\\}$ and a set of timed, directed events (or temporal edges) $E = \\{(A,B,1), (A,C,2), (C,B,3), (C,D,4), (B,D,5)\\}$. The starting condition is presence at node $A$ at time $t=0$. The movement rules permit instantaneous traversal of an event $(u,v,t_e)$ at its specified time $t_e$, and waiting at any node, which incurs a time cost of $1$ unit per time step.\n\nLet $T_{arr}(v)$ represent the earliest possible arrival time at any node $v \\in V$. The initial conditions are stipulated by the problem statement:\n$$ T_{arr}(A) = 0 $$\n$$ T_{arr}(v) = \\infty \\text{ for } v \\in \\{B, C, D\\} $$\n\nTo find the earliest arrival times, we can process the events in their chronological order. For each event $(u,v,t_e)$, a traversal is possible if the source node $u$ is reachable at a time $T_{arr}(u)$ such that $T_{arr}(u) \\le t_e$. If this condition is met, a new potential path to node $v$ is established with an arrival time of $t_e$. We update $T_{arr}(v)$ if this new path provides an earlier arrival, i.e., if $t_e  T_{arr}(v)$.\n\nThe events in chronological order are:\n1. Event $(A,B,1)$ at $t=1$:\nThe source node is $A$. The earliest arrival time is $T_{arr}(A) = 0$. The condition for traversal, $T_{arr}(A) \\le 1$, is met since $0 \\le 1$. We can therefore wait at node $A$ from $t=0$ to $t=1$ and then traverse the edge. The arrival at node $B$ occurs at $t=1$. The current earliest arrival time is $T_{arr}(B) = \\infty$. As $1  \\infty$, we update the earliest arrival time for $B$: $T_{arr}(B) = 1$. This arrival is achieved via the event sequence $\\{(A,B,1)\\}$.\n\n2. Event $(A,C,2)$ at $t=2$:\nThe source node is $A$, with $T_{arr}(A) = 0$. The condition $T_{arr}(A) \\le 2$ is met ($0 \\le 2$). Traversal is possible, leading to an arrival at node $C$ at time $t=2$. The current $T_{arr}(C) = \\infty$. As $2  \\infty$, we update: $T_{arr}(C) = 2$. This arrival is achieved via the event sequence $\\{(A,C,2)\\}$.\n\n3. Event $(C,B,3)$ at $t=3$:\nThe source node is $C$. From the previous step, the earliest arrival at $C$ is $T_{arr}(C) = 2$. The condition $T_{arr}(C) \\le 3$ is met ($2 \\le 3$). This event sequence leads to an arrival at node $B$ at time $t=3$. We compare this to the current earliest arrival time for $B$, which is $T_{arr}(B) = 1$. Since $3 \\not 1$, this path does not provide an earlier arrival time. Thus, $T_{arr}(B)$ remains $1$.\n\n4. Event $(C,D,4)$ at $t=4$:\nThe source node is $C$, with $T_{arr}(C) = 2$. The condition $T_{arr}(C) \\le 4$ is met ($2 \\le 4$). Traversal leads to an arrival at the target node $D$ at time $t=4$. The current $T_{arr}(D) = \\infty$. As $4  \\infty$, we update: $T_{arr}(D) = 4$. The time-respecting path for this arrival is composed of the event leading to $C$ followed by this event: $\\{(A,C,2), (C,D,4)\\}$.\n\n5. Event $(B,D,5)$ at $t=5$:\nThe source node is $B$, with $T_{arr}(B) = 1$. The condition $T_{arr}(B) \\le 5$ is met ($1 \\le 5$). Traversal leads to an arrival at node $D$ at time $t=5$. We compare this with the current earliest arrival time $T_{arr}(D) = 4$. Since $5 \\not 4$, we do not update $T_{arr}(D)$.\n\nAfter evaluating all events, the final earliest arrival time at the destination node $D$ is $T_{arr}(D) = 4$.\n\nThe problem requires the listing of all distinct time-respecting paths that achieve this earliest arrival time. In our systematic evaluation, the value of $T_{arr}(D)$ was set to $4$ on exactly one occasion, during the processing of event $(C,D,4)$. This path was built upon the unique earliest path to node $C$, which was via event $(A,C,2)$. Therefore, there is only one such optimal path. The path, as a sequence of event traversals, is $\\{(A,C,2), (C,D,4)\\}$.\n\nTo justify that no path can arrive earlier, we perform a logical analysis. A time-respecting path to node $D$ must conclude with an event from the set $E$ that has $D$ as its target node. The given events are $(C,D,4)$ and $(B,D,5)$. The arrival time at $D$ is defined as the timestamp of this final event. Consequently, any possible arrival time at $D$ must be either $4$ or $5$. The minimum of these potential arrival times is $4$.\n\nFor the arrival time of $4$ to be achievable, there must exist a valid time-respecting path that terminates with the event $(C,D,4)$. The validity of this path segment requires that node $C$ be reachable at some time $t_C \\le 4$.\nTo determine the earliest arrival time at $C$, we inspect the events inbound to $C$. The only such event is $(A,C,2)$. This event may be traversed because the start node $A$ is occupied at $t=0$, and $0 \\le 2$. This traversal leads to an arrival at $C$ at $t=2$. Therefore, the earliest arrival at $C$ is $T_{arr}(C)=2$.\nSince we can reach node $C$ at $t=2$, and $2 \\le 4$, we can wait at $C$ from $t=2$ to $t=4$ and then traverse the event $(C,D,4)$. This constitutes a valid time-respecting path to $D$, with an arrival time of $4$.\n\nSince we have demonstrated the existence of a path with arrival time $4$, and we have established that no event can lead to an arrival at $D$ at a time earlier than $4$, we conclude that the earliest arrival time is $4$.",

The observed events are $(A,B,1)$, $(B,C,2)$, and $(A,C,3)$. In temporal network analysis, one standard construction is the time-expanded supra-graph, whose vertices are pairs $(x,t)$ for each site $x \\in \\{A,B,C\\}$ and each time $t \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, and whose edges encode both inter-site interactions at the same time and intra-site waiting across consecutive times.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires two tasks: constructing the Supra-Adjacency Matrix (SAM) of the time-expanded graph and then using it to find the shortest temporal path cost from $(A,1)$ to $(C,3)$.\n\n**1. Construction of the Supra-Adjacency Matrix (SAM)**\n\nThe set of vertices in the time-expanded graph is $V' = \\{(x,t) | x \\in \\{A,B,C\\}, t \\in \\{1,2,3\\}\\}$. The prescribed ordering of these $9$ vertices is:\n$v_1=(A,1), v_2=(B,1), v_3=(C,1), v_4=(A,2), v_5=(B,2), v_6=(C,2), v_7=(A,3), v_8=(B,3), v_9=(C,3)$.\n\nThe SAM, which we denote as $W$, is a $9 \\times 9$ matrix where $W_{ij}$ is the weight of the edge from vertex $v_i$ to vertex $v_j$. We initialize $W_{ij} = +\\infty$ for $i \\neq j$ and $W_{ii} = 0$. We then populate the matrix according to the given rules.\n\n**Interaction Edges (Cost $0$):**\n- From $(A,B,1)$: edges $(A,1) \\leftrightarrow (B,1)$, i.e., $v_1 \\leftrightarrow v_2$. This sets $W_{12} = 0$ and $W_{21}=0$.\n- From $(B,C,2)$: edges $(B,2) \\leftrightarrow (C,2)$, i.e., $v_5 \\leftrightarrow v_6$. This sets $W_{56} = 0$ and $W_{65}=0$.\n- From $(A,C,3)$: edges $(A,3) \\leftrightarrow (C,3)$, i.e., $v_7 \\leftrightarrow v_9$. This sets $W_{79} = 0$ and $W_{97}=0$.\n\n**Waiting Edges (Cost $1$):**\n- From $t=1$ to $t=2$:\n    - $(A,1) \\to (A,2)$ ($v_1 \\to v_4$): $W_{14} = 1$.\n    - $(B,1) \\to (B,2)$ ($v_2 \\to v_5$): $W_{25} = 1$.\n    - $(C,1) \\to (C,2)$ ($v_3 \\to v_6$): $W_{36} = 1$.\n- From $t=2$ to $t=3$:\n    - $(A,2) \\to (A,3)$ ($v_4 \\to v_7$): $W_{47} = 1$.\n    - $(B,2) \\to (B,3)$ ($v_5 \\to v_8$): $W_{58} = 1$.\n    - $(C,2) \\to (C,3)$ ($v_6 \\to v_9$): $W_{69} = 1$.\n\nCombining these, the complete Supra-Adjacency Matrix $W$ is:\n$$\nW =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  \\infty  1  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty \\\\\n0  0  \\infty  \\infty  1  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty \\\\\n\\infty  \\infty  0  \\infty  \\infty  1  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty \\\\\n\\infty  \\infty  \\infty  0  \\infty  \\infty  1  \\infty  \\infty \\\\\n\\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  0  0  \\infty  1  \\infty \\\\\n\\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  0  0  \\infty  \\infty  1 \\\\\n\\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  0  \\infty  0 \\\\\n\\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  0  \\infty \\\\\n\\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  \\infty  0  \\infty  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2. Computation of the Shortest-Path Temporal Cost**\n\nWe need to find the shortest path cost from the source vertex $v_1 = (A,1)$ to the destination vertex $v_9 = (C,3)$. The cost of a path is the sum of the weights of its edges. Since the graph is a DAG (with respect to time progression) and all edge weights are non-negative, this is a well-defined shortest path problem solvable by algorithms like Dijkstra's or by direct path enumeration for a small graph. We will trace the possible temporal paths.\n\nA temporal path from $(A,1)$ to $(C,3)$ must sequence through time to reach $t=3$. The cost represents the total elapsed time due to waiting steps. We want to minimize this cost. Any path to $(C,3)$ must arrive via its immediate predecessors in the graph: $(C,2)$ or $(A,3)$.\n\n**Case 1: The path arrives at $(C,3)$ from $(C,2)$.**\nThe final step is the waiting edge $(C,2) \\to (C,3)$ (i.e., $v_6 \\to v_9$), which has a cost of $1$. The total cost of this path is $1$ plus the shortest path cost from $(A,1)$ to $(C,2)$.\nTo find the shortest path from $(A,1)$ to $(C,2)$, we trace paths:\n- Path Segment: $(A,1) \\to (B,1) \\to (B,2) \\to (C,2)$.\n- The path is $v_1 \\to v_2 \\to v_5 \\to v_6$.\n- Cost to reach $(C,2)$ is $0 + 1 + 0 = 1$.\n- Total path cost via this route: (Cost to $(C,2)$) + (Cost from $(C,2)$ to $(C,3)$) = $1 + 1 = 2$.\nThe sequence of events for this path is: interaction at $t=1$, wait from $t=1$ to $t=2$, interaction at $t=2$, wait from $t=2$ to $t=3$.\n\n**Case 2: The path arrives at $(C,3)$ from $(A,3)$.**\nThe final step is the interaction edge $(A,3) \\to (C,3)$ (i.e., $v_7 \\to v_9$), which has a cost of $0$. The total cost of this path is $0$ plus the shortest path cost from $(A,1)$ to $(A,3)$.\nTo find the shortest path from $(A,1)$ to $(A,3)$, we trace paths:\n- Path Segment: $(A,1) \\to (A,2) \\to (A,3)$.\n- The path is $v_1 \\to v_4 \\to v_7$.\n- Cost to reach $(A,3)$ is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n- Total path cost via this route: (Cost to $(A,3)$) + (Cost from $(A,3)$ to $(C,3)$) = $2 + 0 = 2$.\nThe sequence of events for this path is: wait from $t=1$ to $t=2$, wait from $t=2$ to $t=3$, interaction at $t=3$.\n\nBoth minimal paths yield the same total cost. By comparing the costs of all possible paths to the destination, the minimum cost is determined. The shortest-path temporal cost from $(A,1)$ to $(C,3)$ is the minimum of the costs found in these cases.\n\nMinimum cost = $\\min(2, 2) = 2$.",

Since $1  2$, this is a valid causal path: $A \\xrightarrow{t=1} B \\xrightarrow{t=2} C$.\n\nThere are no other causal paths from $A$ to $C$.\n\nThe path $A \\xrightarrow{t=1} B \\xrightarrow{t=2} C$ is not faithfully inferable from the aggregated edge weights alone. The matrix $W$ shows static adjacencies $(A,B)$ and $(B,C)$, from which one can construct a static path $A-B-C$. However, the crucial information that the contact $(A,B)$ occurred *before* the contact $(B,C)$ is entirely absent from $W$. The aggregated representation treats all edges as co-existing, losing the directed nature of time. Therefore, one cannot determine from $W$ alone whether the path $A-B-C$ corresponds to a causal sequence of events or a non-causal one. This path's causality is encoded in the specific time-ordered matrix product $A^{(1)}A^{(2)}$, not in the sum $A^{(1)}+A^{(2)}$.\n\n**Task 4: Dynamic Communicability $Q_{AC}(\\alpha)$**\n\nThe dynamic communicability matrix is $Q(\\alpha) = Q^{(1)} Q^{(2)} Q^{(3)}$, where $Q^{(t)} = (I - \\alpha A^{(t)})^{-1}$. We need to compute the $(1,3)$ entry of $Q(\\alpha)$, which we denote $Q_{AC}(\\alpha)$.\n\nFirst, we compute each $Q^{(t)}$. For an adjacency matrix $A$ of a single undirected edge between nodes $i$ and $j$, the matrix $(I-\\alpha A)$ has a determinant of $1-\\alpha^2$ for the sub-block concerning $i,j$. The inverse, $(I-\\alpha A)^{-1}$, is the identity matrix except for the $2 \\times 2$ block corresponding to nodes $i$ and $j$, which is $\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor $t=1$, the edge is $(1,2)$:\n$$ Q^{(1)} = (I - \\alpha A^{(1)})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2}  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}  0 \\\\ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}  \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2}  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFor $t=2$, the edge is $(2,3)$:\n$$ Q^{(2)} = (I - \\alpha A^{(2)})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2}  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2} \\\\ 0  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}  \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFor $t=3$, the edge is $(1,3)$:\n$$ Q^{(3)} = (I - \\alpha A^{(3)})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2}  0  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2} \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}  0  \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe entry $Q_{AC}(\\alpha) = Q_{13}(\\alpha)$ is given by the matrix product rule:\n$$ Q_{13}(\\alpha) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (Q^{(1)})_{1j} (Q^{(2)})_{jk} (Q^{(3)})_{k3} $$\nWe evaluate the sum by considering the non-zero terms.\nThe non-zero entries of the first row of $Q^{(1)}$ are $(Q^{(1)})_{11}$ and $(Q^{(1)})_{12}$.\nThe non-zero entries of the third column of $Q^{(3)}$ are $(Q^{(3)})_{13}$ and $(Q^{(3)})_{33}$.\nThis restricts the possible indices $(j,k)$ to $(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3)$.\n\nLet's evaluate the contribution for each $(j,k)$:\n*   $(j,k)=(1,1)$: $(Q^{(1)})_{11} (Q^{(2)})_{11} (Q^{(3)})_{13} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) (1) \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{(1-\\alpha^2)^2}$.\n*   $(j,k)=(1,3)$: $(Q^{(1)})_{11} (Q^{(2)})_{13} (Q^{(3)})_{33} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) (0) \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) = 0$.\n*   $(j,k)=(2,1)$: $(Q^{(1)})_{12} (Q^{(2)})_{21} (Q^{(3)})_{13} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) (0) \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) = 0$.\n*   $(j,k)=(2,3)$: $(Q^{(1)})_{12} (Q^{(2)})_{23} (Q^{(3)})_{33} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{(1-\\alpha^2)^3}$.\n\nThe total sum is the addition of the non-zero terms:\n$$ Q_{AC}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha}{(1-\\alpha^2)^2} + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{(1-\\alpha^2)^3} $$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator, which is $(1-\\alpha^2)^3$:\n$$ Q_{AC}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha(1-\\alpha^2)}{(1-\\alpha^2)^3} + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{(1-\\alpha^2)^3} = \\frac{\\alpha - \\alpha^3 + \\alpha^2}{(1-\\alpha^2)^3} $$\nRearranging the numerator gives the final closed-form expression.",
