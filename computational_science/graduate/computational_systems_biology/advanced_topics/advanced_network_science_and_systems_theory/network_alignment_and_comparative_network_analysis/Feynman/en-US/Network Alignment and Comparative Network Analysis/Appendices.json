This is the assignment problem. While general instances require an algorithm such as the Hungarian algorithm, we can inspect the matrix $S$ for special structure.\n\nObserve the matrix $S$. For each row $i$, the diagonal element $S(i,i)$ is strictly the largest value in that row.\n- Row $1$: $S(1,1) = 0.87$ is the maximum.\n- Row $2$: $S(2,2) = 0.83$ is the maximum.\n- Row $3$: $S(3,3) = 0.88$ is the maximum.\n- Row $4$: $S(4,4) = 0.886$ is the maximum.\n\nLet the identity mapping be $\\pi_{\\mathrm{id}}(i) = i$. The total similarity for this mapping is the trace of the matrix $S$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Tr}(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} S(i,i) = S(1,1) + S(2,2) + S(3,3) + S(4,4) $$\nFor any other permutation $\\pi \\neq \\pi_{\\mathrm{id}}$, the total similarity is $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} S(i, \\pi(i))$. For each $i$, because $S(i,i)$ is the maximum value in the $i$-th row, we have the inequality $S(i,i) \\ge S(i, \\pi(i))$. Since for this specific matrix $S$, $S(i,i)$ is strictly greater than any other element in its row, the inequality is strict if $\\pi(i) \\neq i$: $S(i,i) > S(i, \\pi(i))$.\nSumming over all $i$ from $1$ to $4$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} S(i,i) \\ge \\sum_{i=1}^{4} S(i, \\pi(i)) $$\nSince $\\pi$ is not the identity permutation, there must be at least two indices $i$ for which $\\pi(i) \\neq i$, and for these indices, the strict inequality $S(i,i) > S(i, \\pi(i))$ holds. This proves that the sum for the identity mapping is strictly greater than the sum for any other permutation. Therefore, the maximum total similarity is achieved by the identity mapping $\\pi(i)=i$. The maximum value is the sum of the diagonal elements of $S$.\n\nWe now calculate this sum:\n$$ \\text{Maximum Similarity} = 0.87 + 0.83 + 0.88 + 0.886 $$\n$$ \\text{Maximum Similarity} = 1.70 + 1.766 $$\n$$ \\text{Maximum Similarity} = 3.466 $$\nThe maximum total integrated similarity over all possible one-to-one mappings is $3.466$.",

It shows that the largest conserved module is a connected group of 4 nodes, indicating that a significant piece of the original network's structure was kept intact, even though one edge was lost.\n\nThe final values are $\\mathrm{EC}=3/4$, $\\mathrm{ICS}=1/2$, $\\mathrm{S3}=3/7$, and $\\mathrm{LCCS}=4$.",
