The tasks lead to a unique, computable result.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n- **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary information and definitions required for the solution are provided. It does not suffer from being underspecified or overconstrained.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state condition $S v = 0$ for a flux vector $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4)^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$. The additional constraint is that all reactions are irreversible, so $v_j \\geq 0$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe matrix equation $S v = 0$ corresponds to the following system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_4 \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis system expands to:\n1.  $1 \\cdot v_1 - 1 \\cdot v_2 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_2$\n2.  $1 \\cdot v_2 - 1 \\cdot v_3 = 0 \\implies v_2 = v_3$\n3.  $-1 \\cdot v_4 = 0 \\implies v_4 = 0$\n4.  $1 \\cdot v_4 = 0 \\implies v_4 = 0$\n\nFrom these equations, we deduce that any feasible steady-state flux vector must satisfy $v_1 = v_2 = v_3$ and $v_4 = 0$.\n\n**Identification of Blocked Reactions**\nA reaction $j$ is defined as blocked if its flux $v_j$ must be zero for every vector in the feasible flux cone $\\mathcal{C}$. Our analysis showed that for any $v \\in \\mathcal{C}$, the component $v_4$ must be $0$. Therefore, reaction $r_4$ is a blocked reaction.\nThe other reactions, $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$, are not blocked. For example, the flux vector $v = (1, 1, 1, 0)^T$ satisfies both $S v = 0$ and $v \\geq 0$, and for this vector, $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are all non-zero.\n\n**Construction of the Reduced Stoichiometric Matrix $S_{\\mathrm{red}}$**\nThe reduction procedure involves removing the column corresponding to the blocked reaction $r_4$ and the rows corresponding to dead-end metabolites (metabolites involved only in blocked reactions).\nMetabolite $x$ corresponds to the third row of $S$. Its only non-zero stoichiometric coefficient is in the column for $r_4$. Metabolite $y$ corresponds to the fourth row, and it also only participates in $r_4$. Since $r_4$ is the only blocked reaction, both $x$ and $y$ are dead-end metabolites.\nWe remove column $4$ and rows $3$ and $4$ from the original matrix $S$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nThis reduced matrix represents the stoichiometry for the active part of the network involving metabolites $(b, c)$ and reactions $(r_1, r_2, r_3)$.\n\n**Enumeration of Extreme Pathways of the Original Network**\nThe feasible flux cone for the original network is $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4} \\mid v_1 = v_2 = v_3, v_4 = 0, v_j \\geq 0 \\}$.\nAny vector $v \\in \\mathcal{C}$ can be expressed as a non-negative scalar multiple of a basis vector. Let $\\alpha = v_1$. Since $v_1 \\geq 0$, we have $\\alpha \\geq 0$. Then $v$ can be written as:\n$$ v = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nGeometrically, the cone $\\mathcal{C}$ is a single ray in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ starting at the origin and pointing in the direction of the vector $p_1 = (1, 1, 1, 0)^T$. An extreme pathway is an extreme ray of this cone. A cone that is a single ray is a $1$-dimensional convex set. Its extreme points are just the ray itself (when considered as a generator). Thus, there is exactly one extreme pathway. We can represent it by the vector $p_1$. The number of extreme pathways before reduction is $1$.\n\n**Enumeration of Extreme Pathways of the Reduced Network**\nThe feasible flux cone for the reduced network is $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\{ v_{\\mathrm{red}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid S_{\\mathrm{red}} v_{\\mathrm{red}} = 0, v_{\\mathrm{red}} \\geq 0 \\}$, where $v_{\\mathrm{red}} = (v_1, v_2, v_3)^T$.\nThe condition $S_{\\mathrm{red}} v_{\\mathrm{red}} = 0$ leads to the system:\n1.  $v_1 - v_2 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_2$\n2.  $v_2 - v_3 = 0 \\implies v_2 = v_3$\nSo, $v_1 = v_2 = v_3$. Let $\\alpha = v_1$. The constraint $v_{\\mathrm{red}} \\geq 0$ implies $\\alpha \\geq 0$. Any vector in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{red}}$ can be written as:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha \\end{pmatrix} = \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nThis cone, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{red}}$, is also a single ray, this time in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, generated by the vector $p_{\\mathrm{red}} = (1, 1, 1)^T$. By the same logic as for the original network, this system has exactly one extreme pathway. The number of extreme pathways after reduction is $1$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the change in the number of extreme pathways, defined as $(\\text{after reduction}) - (\\text{before reduction})$.\nNumber of extreme pathways before reduction = $1$.\nNumber of extreme pathways after reduction = $1$.\nChange = $1 - 1 = 0$.\nThe blocked reaction and its associated dead-end metabolites form a disconnected, non-functional part of the network that does not contribute any steady-state pathways. Its removal does not alter the pathway structure of the functional part of the network.",

This implies that the uptake flux $v_1$ and secretion flux $v_7$ must be non-zero. Examining the EPs:\n- $p_1$ has $v_1=1$ and $v_7=1$, representing the pathway $A_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\rightarrow A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow D \\rightarrow D_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n- $p_2$ has $v_1=1$ and $v_7=1$, representing the pathway $A_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\rightarrow A \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow D \\rightarrow D_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n- $p_3$ has $v_1=0$ and $v_7=0$, representing an isolated, non-functional reaction $v_6$.\n\nTherefore, the two EPs of interest are $p_1$ and $p_2$. We set $E_1 = p_1$ and $E_2 = p_2$. These are distinct, non-collinear EPs that convert $A$ to $D_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ via different internal routes.\n\nNow we must verify that they produce identical exchange fluxes. The exchange flux vector is given by $B v$, where $B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $E_1$:\n$$ B E_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor $E_2$:\n$$ B E_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, $B E_1 = B E_2$, despite $E_1 \\neq E_2$.

The steady-state condition is given by $S v = 0$, where $v = (v_{1}^{+}, v_{1}^{-}, v_{2}^{+}, v_{2}^{-})^T$ and the stoichiometric matrix is $S = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix equation expands to two linear equations:\n$$\n-v_{1}^{+} + v_{1}^{-} - v_{2}^{+} + v_{2}^{-} = 0\n$$\n$$\nv_{1}^{+} - v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{+} - v_{2}^{-} = 0\n$$\nIt is immediately apparent that the second equation is the negative of the first. Therefore, the system is described by a single unique linear constraint:\n$$\nv_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}\n$$\nThis equation represents the conservation of mass at steady state: the total flux producing $B$ from $A$ (and consuming $A$) must equal the total flux producing $A$ from $B$ (and consuming $B$). The flux cone $C$ is the set of all vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ satisfying this equation and the non-negativity constraint $v \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate the existence of internal cycles. An internal cycle is a non-zero flux vector $v \\in C$ that results in no net production or consumption of metabolites from the environment. As this model contains no exchange reactions, any non-zero $v \\in C$ represents an internal flux mode. A futile cycle specifically refers to a loop of reactions that consumes energy without net chemical conversion, for instance, $A \\to B \\to A$. Let us construct such a cycle using reaction $R_{1}^{+}$ ($A \\to B$) and reaction $R_{2}^{-}$ ($B \\to A$). We can define a flux vector $v_c$ corresponding to this cycle:\n$$\nv_c = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis vector must be an element of the cone $C$. We check the two conditions for membership in $C$:\n$1$. Non-negativity: $v_c \\ge 0$. All components of $v_c$ are non-negative, so this is satisfied.\n$2$. Steady state: $S v_c = 0$. We check the simplified constraint $v_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}$:\n$$\n1 + 0 = 0 + 1 \\implies 1 = 1\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Since $v_c$ is a non-zero vector in $C$, we have explicitly constructed a feasible flux distribution that represents an internal futile cycle. This demonstrates that the splitting of reversible reactions and the imposition of non-negativity constraints alone permit such cycles.\n\nSecond, we determine all extreme pathways of the cone $C$. Extreme pathways are the minimal, non-decomposable generating vectors (extreme rays) of the convex cone $C$. A flux vector is an extreme pathway if the set of reactions with non-zero flux is minimal, meaning no proper non-empty subset of these active reactions can satisfy the steady-state condition on its own. We search for such minimal sets of reactions. The governing equation is $v_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}$.\nLet's test minimal combinations of reactions (columns of $S$):\n- Set $1$: $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{1}^{-}\\}$. The steady-state condition for this subset is $v_{1}^{+} = v_{1}^{-}$. A minimal positive integer solution is $v_{1}^{+}=1, v_{1}^{-}=1$. This gives the pathway $P_1 = (1, 1, 0, 0)^T$. This vector cannot be decomposed into other non-negative vectors in the cone.\n- Set $2$: $\\{R_{2}^{+}, R_{2}^{-}\\}$. The condition is $v_{2}^{+} = v_{2}^{-}$. A minimal solution gives the pathway $P_2 = (0, 0, 1, 1)^T$.\n- Set $3$: $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{2}^{-}\\}$. The condition is $v_{1}^{+} = v_{2}^{-}$. A minimal solution gives the pathway $P_3 = (1, 0, 0, 1)^T$. This corresponds to the futile cycle $A \\to B$ via $R_1$ and $B \\to A$ via $R_2$.\n- Set $4$: $\\{R_{2}^{+}, R_{1}^{-}\\}$. The condition is $v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-}$. A minimal solution gives the pathway $P_4 = (0, 1, 1, 0)^T$. This is the other futile cycle $A \\to B$ via $R_2$ and $B \\to A$ via $R_1$.\n\nAny combination involving only reactions that consume $A$ (e.g., $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{2}^{+}\\}$) or only reactions that produce $A$ (e.g., $\\{R_{1}^{-}, R_{2}^{-}\\}$) cannot satisfy the steady state condition with non-zero fluxes. For instance, for $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{2}^{+}\\}$, the condition is $v_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = 0$, which given $v \\ge 0$ implies $v_{1}^{+} = 0$ and $v_{2}^{+}=0$. Thus, no non-zero flux is possible. Any set of $3$ or $4$ reactions is not minimal. For example, a flux using $\\{R_{1}^{+}, R_{1}^{-}, R_{2}^{+}\\}$ such as $(1, 2, 1, 0)^T$ (where $1+1=2+0$ is false, should be $v_{1}^{+}+v_{2}^{+}=v_{1}^{-}$, so $1+1=2$) gives the vector $v = (1, 2, 1, 0)^T$. This vector can be decomposed as $P_4 + P_1 = (0, 1, 1, 0)^T + (1, 1, 0, 0)^T$. Hence, it is not an extreme pathway.\nThe four vectors $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, and $P_4$ constitute the complete set of minimal generating vectors for the cone $C$. The number of extreme pathways for $C$ is therefore $4$.\n\nThird, we incorporate thermodynamic constraints. We are given $\\mu_B - \\mu_A > 0$. Let this positive quantity be $\\Delta \\mu = \\mu_B - \\mu_A$. The Gibbs free energy changes for the four reactions are:\n- $\\Delta G(R_{1}^{+}) = \\mu_{B} - \\mu_{A} = \\Delta \\mu > 0$\n- $\\Delta G(R_{1}^{-}) = \\mu_{A} - \\mu_{B} = -\\Delta \\mu < 0$\n- $\\Delta G(R_{2}^{+}) = \\mu_{B} - \\mu_{A} = \\Delta \\mu > 0$\n- $\\Delta G(R_{2}^{-}) = \\mu_{A} - \\mu_{B} = -\\Delta \\mu < 0$\n\nThe energy-dissipation inequality is $v_{i}^{\\pm} \\Delta G(R_{i}^{\\pm}) \\le 0$. Since all fluxes $v_{i}^{\\pm}$ must be non-negative ($v_{i}^{\\pm} \\ge 0$), this inequality imposes conditions on the fluxes.\n- For $R_{1}^{+}$: $v_{1}^{+} \\Delta \\mu \\le 0$. Since $\\Delta \\mu > 0$, this implies $v_{1}^{+} = 0$.\n- For $R_{1}^{-}$: $v_{1}^{-} (-\\Delta \\mu) \\le 0$. Since $-\\Delta \\mu < 0$, this is satisfied for any $v_{1}^{-} \\ge 0$.\n- For $R_{2}^{+}$: $v_{2}^{+} \\Delta \\mu \\le 0$. Since $\\Delta \\mu > 0$, this implies $v_{2}^{+} = 0$.\n- For $R_{2}^{-}$: $v_{2}^{-} (-\\Delta \\mu) \\le 0$. Since $-\\Delta \\mu < 0$, this is satisfied for any $v_{2}^{-} \\ge 0$.\n\nThe new thermodynamically constrained cone, $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$, is defined by the set of fluxes $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ satisfying:\n$1$. $v \\ge 0$\n$2$. $v_{1}^{+} + v_{2}^{+} = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}$\n$3$. $v_{1}^{+} = 0$\n$4$. $v_{2}^{+} = 0$\n\nSubstituting the thermodynamic constraints ($v_{1}^{+} = 0$, $v_{2}^{+} = 0$) into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\n0 + 0 = v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-}\n$$\nSo, $v_{1}^{-} + v_{2}^{-} = 0$. Given the non-negativity constraint ($v_{1}^{-} \\ge 0$ and $v_{2}^{-} \\ge 0$), the only solution to this equation is $v_{1}^{-} = 0$ and $v_{2}^{-} = 0$.\nTherefore, the only flux vector $v$ that satisfies all conditions for membership in $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$ is the zero vector:\n$$\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^T\n$$\nGeometrically, the original cone $C$ has been intersected with the hyperplanes $v_{1}^{+}=0$ and $v_{2}^{+}=0$, which reduces the entire feasible space to the origin. An extreme pathway, by definition, is a non-zero vector that generates an extreme ray of the cone. Since the only element of $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$ is the zero vector, there are no non-zero vectors to form extreme rays. Consequently, the set of extreme pathways for $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$ is empty, and its cardinality is $0$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the decrease in the number of extreme pathways when passing from the purely stoichiometric cone $C$ to the thermodynamically constrained cone $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$.\n- Number of extreme pathways for $C$: $4$.\n- Number of extreme pathways for $C_{\\mathrm{thermo}}$: $0$.\nThe decrease in the number of extreme pathways is the difference: $4 - 0 = 4$.",
