The solution proceeds in five steps: first, we determine the deterministic steady state; second, we compute the Jacobian matrix $A$; third, we compute the diffusion matrix $D$; fourth, we solve the stationary Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix $C$; and finally, we use the results to calculate the desired quantities.\n\nStep 1: Determine the deterministic steady state $x^{\\ast}$.\nThe deterministic rate equations for the mean concentrations are given by the expression $\\frac{dx}{dt} = S \\nu(x)$, where $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{X} \\\\ x_{Y} \\end{pmatrix}$ is the state vector of molecular counts, $S$ is the stoichiometry matrix, and $\\nu(x)$ is the propensity vector.\n\nWriting this out explicitly:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} x_{X} \\\\ x_{Y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  -1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} k_{0} \\\\ \\gamma_{1} x_{X} \\\\ k_{12} x_{X} \\\\ \\gamma_{2} x_{Y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_{0} - \\gamma_{1} x_{X} - k_{12} x_{X} \\\\ k_{12} x_{X} - \\gamma_{2} x_{Y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_{X}}{dt} = k_{0} - (\\gamma_{1} + k_{12})x_{X}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx_{Y}}{dt} = k_{12}x_{X} - \\gamma_{2}x_{Y}\n$$\nThe steady state $x^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{X}^{\\ast} \\\\ x_{Y}^{\\ast} \\end{pmatrix}$ is found by setting the time derivatives to zero.

The parameter $\\lambda$ itself is a random variable across the cell population, reflecting extrinsic variability.\n\nUsing the law of total expectation for the mean:\n$$ \\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid \\lambda]] = \\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] $$\nUsing the law of total variance:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X \\mid \\lambda)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid \\lambda]) $$\nFor a Poisson distribution, $\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid \\lambda] = \\mathrm{Var}(X \\mid \\lambda) = \\lambda$. Substituting these into the variance formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda) = \\mu + \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda) $$\nThe coefficient of variation squared for this model is:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{\\mu + \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} + \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}{\\mu^2} $$\n\n### Model 2: Intrinsic Bursting\n\nThis model describes gene expression as a process of transcriptional bursts. The steady-state mRNA count distribution for this process is known to be a Negative Binomial distribution.

Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the expression levels of two independent reporter genes in the same cell.\n- In the extrinsic model, both genes are subject to the same extrinsic variable $\\lambda$. Thus, $X_1$ and $X_2$ are conditionally independent given $\\lambda$, but they are correlated across the population. Their covariance is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1|\\lambda], \\mathbb{E}[X_2|\\lambda]) = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\lambda, \\lambda) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda) $$\nThe correlation coefficient $\\rho = \\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X_1)\\mathrm{Var}(X_2)}$ is:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}{\\mu + \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)} $$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)  0$ for there to be any extrinsic noise, the correlation is strictly positive, $\\rho  0$.\n- In the intrinsic model, the stochastic bursting of the two independent reporters is uncorrelated. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = 0$ and $\\rho = 0$.\nThis difference in predicted correlation provides a clear experimental signature.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Extrinsic rate heterogeneity is modeled by a Poisson-lognormal mixture...**\n- **Extrinsic Model Parameterization:** The option proposes $\\lambda \\sim \\mathrm{LogNormal}(\\mu_\\ell, \\sigma_\\ell^2)$ with $\\sigma_\\ell^2 = \\log(1 + 1/r)$ and $\\mu_\\ell = \\log(\\mu) - \\sigma_\\ell^2/2$. For a lognormal distribution, the mean is $e^{\\mu_\\ell + \\sigma_\\ell^2/2}$ and the variance is $(e^{\\sigma_\\ell^2}-1)(e^{\\mu_\\ell + \\sigma_\\ell^2/2})^2$.\n  - Mean: $\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] = e^{(\\log(\\mu) - \\sigma_\\ell^2/2) + \\sigma_\\ell^2/2} = e^{\\log(\\mu)} = \\mu$. This is correct.\n  - Variance: $\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda) = (e^{\\log(1+1/r)}-1)(\\mu)^2 = ((1+1/r)-1)\\mu^2 = \\mu^2/r$. This is also correct. The parameterization correctly matches the required moments.\n- **Intrinsic Model Parameterization:** The option proposes $r \\equiv \\alpha/\\gamma$ and $b \\equiv \\mu/r$. This implies $\\mu = rb$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = 1/\\mu + 1/r$, which is the standard, correct formulation.\n- **Distinguishability:** The extrinsic model is a Poisson-Lognormal mixture, while the intrinsic model is a Negative Binomial distribution. These are different distributions, so they will differ in higher-order moments, satisfying the problem's condition.\n- **Experimental Strategy:** The two-color dual-reporter assay is the correct method. The analysis correctly predicts that for the extrinsic model, the correlation $\\rho$ is strictly positive, while for the intrinsic model, $\\rho \\approx 0$. Let's check the formula for $\\rho$. The option claims $\\rho = \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)/[\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)+\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda]]$, which aligns with our derivation $\\rho = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}{\\mu + \\mathrm{Var}(\\lambda)}$. It then substitutes the matched parameters to get $\\rho = (\\mu/r)/[1 + \\mu/r]$. Let's verify this step: $\\rho = \\frac{\\mu^2/r}{\\mu + \\mu^2/r} = \\frac{\\mu/r}{1 + \\mu/r}$. The final formula is correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. All parts of this option are consistent with first principles.\n\n**B. Extrinsic rate heterogeneity is modeled by a Poisson-gamma mixture...**\n- It is a known mathematical result that a Poisson-Gamma mixture distribution is a Negative Binomial distribution. The intrinsic bursting model also follows a Negative Binomial distribution. By matching the mean and variance (or mean and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$), the two models become mathematically identical, producing the exact same Negative Binomial distribution. This violates the problem's requirement that the models \"differ in higher-order moments\". Furthermore, the proposed experimental strategy is to \"measure the Fano factor alone; a difference in $F$ is expected\". This is incorrect. The Fano factor is $F = \\mu \\cdot \\mathrm{CV}^2$. Since both $\\mu$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$ are matched by construction, the Fano factors must be identical.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Extrinsic heterogeneity is introduced by making the degradation rate $\\gamma$ log-normally distributed...**\n- This option's proposed experimental strategy is to \"quantify only the mean $\\mu$ across the population; a difference in means is expected\". This directly contradicts a fundamental premise of the problem, which is to construct two models that share the same population mean $\\mu$. The entire point is to find a way to distinguish models that are indistinguishable at the level of the mean and variance.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Extrinsic rate heterogeneity is modeled by a Poisson-lognormal mixture with $\\sigma_\\ell^2 = \\log(1 + \\mu)$ and $\\mu_\\ell = \\log(\\mu)$...**\n- **Extrinsic Model Parameterization:** The proposed parameters give a mean for $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] = e^{\\mu_\\ell + \\sigma_\\ell^2/2} = e^{\\log(\\mu) + \\log(1+\\mu)/2} = \\mu\\sqrt{1+\\mu} \\neq \\mu$. The parameterization fails to match the mean.\n- **Intrinsic Model Parameterization:** The option proposes $b \\equiv r/\\mu$.

The correct relation is $b = \\mu/r$.\n- **Experimental Strategy:** The proposal is to measure the \"autocorrelation at zero lag only\". The autocorrelation of a process at lag zero is, by definition, its variance: $\\mathrm{Cov}(X, X) = \\mathrm{Var}(X)$. Since the models were required to be constructed with the same $\\mu$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$, their variances $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mu^2 \\mathrm{CV}^2$ must also be identical.

I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will be conducted for the two regimes described.\n\n**Regime (i): Global Normalization with a Deterministic Constant $s$**\n\nIn this regime, $X$ is a random variable following a Poisson distribution with a fixed parameter, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(s\\mu)$, since $s$ is a deterministic constant. The normalized variable is $Y = X/s$.\n\nFirst, we establish the moments and noise metrics for the unnormalized counts $X$.\n-   Expectation: $\\mathbb{E}[X] = s\\mu$\n-   Variance: $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = s\\mu$ (property of the Poisson distribution)\n-   Fano factor: $\\mathrm{FF}(X) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\\mathbb{E}[X]} = \\frac{s\\mu}{s\\mu} = 1$.\n-   Coefficient of variation: $\\mathrm{CV}(X) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}}{\\mathbb{E}[X]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{s\\mu}}{s\\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s\\mu}}$.\n\nNext, we derive the moments and noise metrics for the normalized counts $Y$.\n-   Expectation: $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[X/s] = \\frac{1}{s}\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{1}{s}(s\\mu) = \\mu$.\n-   Variance: $\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathrm{Var}(X/s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\right)^2\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{s^2}(s\\mu) = \\frac{\\mu}{s}$.\n-   Fano factor: $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}{\\mathbb{E}[Y]} = \\frac{\\mu/s}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{s}$.\n-   Coefficient of variation: $\\mathrm{CV}(Y) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var(Y)}}}{\\mathbb{E}[Y]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu/s}}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu}}{\\mu\\sqrt{s}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s\\mu}}$.\n\nComparing the metrics for $X$ and $Y$:\n-   $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = 1/s$ and $\\mathrm{FF}(X) = 1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = \\mathrm{FF}(X)/s$.\n-   $\\mathrm{CV}(Y) = 1/\\sqrt{s\\mu}$ and $\\mathrm{CV}(X) = 1/\\sqrt{s\\mu}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{CV}(Y) = \\mathrm{CV}(X)$.\n\n**Regime (ii): Per-cell Normalization with Heterogeneous Factors**\n\nIn this regime, the size factors $s_i$ vary and are modeled by a random variable $S$. The count for a cell with size factor $S$ is $X \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(S\\mu)$. The normalized count is $Y=X/S$. We need to find the moments of the distribution of $Y$ over the population of cells. We use the laws of total expectation and total variance.\n\nFirst, we compute the conditional moments of $Y$ given $S$.\n-   Conditional expectation of $Y$ given $S=s$:\n    $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid S=s] = \\mathbb{E}[X/s \\mid S=s] = \\frac{1}{s}\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid S=s] = \\frac{1}{s}(s\\mu) = \\mu$.\n-   Conditional variance of $Y$ given $S=s$:\n    $\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid S=s) = \\mathrm{Var}(X/s \\mid S=s) = \\frac{1}{s^2}\\mathrm{Var}(X \\mid S=s) = \\frac{1}{s^2}(s\\mu) = \\frac{\\mu}{s}$.\n\nNow, we can find the unconditional moments of $Y$ using the laws of iterated expectations and total variance.\n-   Overall expectation of $Y$:\n    $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}_S[\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid S]] = \\mathbb{E}_S[\\mu] = \\mu$.\n-   Overall variance of $Y$:\n    $\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}_S[\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid S)] + \\mathrm{Var}_S(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid S])$.\n    We have $\\mathrm{Var}(Y \\mid S) = \\mu/S$ and $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid S] = \\mu$.\n    $\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}_S[\\mu/S] + \\mathrm{Var}_S(\\mu)$.\n    Since $\\mu$ is a constant, $\\mathrm{Var}_S(\\mu) = 0$.\n    $\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu/S] = \\mu\\mathbb{E}[1/S]$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Fano factor and the squared coefficient of variation for $Y$.\n-   Fano factor:\n    $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}{\\mathbb{E}[Y]} = \\frac{\\mu\\mathbb{E}[1/S]}{\\mu} = \\mathbb{E}[1/S]$.\n-   Squared coefficient of variation:\n    $\\mathrm{CV}^2(Y) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}{(\\mathbb{E}[Y])^2} = \\frac{\\mu\\mathbb{E}[1/S]}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[1/S]}{\\mu}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under a global deterministic constant $s0$, $\\mathrm{CV}(Y)=\\mathrm{CV}(X)$ and $\\mathrm{FF}(Y)=\\mathrm{FF}(X)/s$.**\nFrom our analysis of regime (i), we found $\\mathrm{CV}(Y) = \\mathrm{CV}(X) = 1/\\sqrt{s\\mu}$, and $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = 1/s$ while $\\mathrm{FF}(X)=1$, which means $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = \\mathrm{FF}(X)/s$. Both statements are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Under a global deterministic constant $s0$, $\\mathrm{FF}(Y)=\\mathrm{FF}(X)$ and $\\mathrm{CV}(Y)=\\mathrm{CV}(X)/s$.**\nOur analysis of regime (i) shows $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = \\mathrm{FF}(X)/s$ (not equal, unless $s=1$) and $\\mathrm{CV}(Y) = \\mathrm{CV}(X)$ (not divided by $s$, unless $s=1$). This statement is the opposite of the correct relationships.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Under per-cell deterministic but heterogeneous $s_i0$ with $X_i \\mid s_i \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(s_i \\mu)$, the across-cell Fano factor of the normalized counts is $\\mathrm{FF}(Y)=\\mathbb{E}[1/S]$, independent of $\\mu$.**\nOur analysis of regime (ii) yielded exactly $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}[1/S]$. This expression does not contain $\\mu$, hence it is independent of $\\mu$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Under the same heterogeneous-size-factor model, the across-cell coefficient of variation squared of the normalized counts is $\\mathrm{CV}^2(Y)=\\mathbb{E}[1/S]/\\mu$, which shows that normalization transmits technical heterogeneity ($\\mathbb{E}[1/S]$) into noise metrics and can entangle it with the biological level $\\mu$.**\nOur analysis of regime (ii) yielded exactly $\\mathrm{CV}^2(Y) = \\mathbb{E}[1/S]/\\mu$. The interpretation provided is sound: the term $\\mathbb{E}[1/S]$ depends on the distribution of size factors $S$, which can be considered technical (related to measurement, e.g., library size). The term $\\mu$ is the biological signal. The final noise metric $\\mathrm{CV}^2(Y)$ is a function of both, demonstrating that the technical aspect (variation in $S$) is not removed by normalization but is instead incorporated into the final noise metric, where it is entangled (multiplicatively combined) with the biological signal.\n**Verdict: Correct**",
