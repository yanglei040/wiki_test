The fluid is incompressible, the solid matrix is rigid, and the porosity $n$ is constant in space and time. There are no internal sources or sinks. The hydraulic head $h(x)$ is prescribed at the boundaries: $h(0)=h_{0}$ and $h(L)=h_{L}$, where $h_{0}$ and $h_{L}$ are constants. Using only local conservation of mass, the appropriate constitutive relation for creeping flow through porous media, and the definition of hydraulic head, derive the governing boundary value problem and solve for the steady hydraulic head $h(x)$ on $[0,L]$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the governing boundary value problem for steady, one-dimensional Darcy flow and its solution for the hydraulic head $h(x)$, the specific discharge $q$, and the seepage velocity $v_s$. The derivation proceeds from first principles.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of local conservation of mass. For a saturated porous medium with a rigid solid matrix (constant porosity $n$) and an incompressible fluid (constant density $\\rho$), the steady-state mass conservation equation in the absence of sources or sinks is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\vec{q}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{q}$ is the specific discharge vector. Since the fluid density $\\rho$ is constant, this equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{q} = 0\n$$\nFor a one-dimensional domain aligned with the $x$-axis, where flow occurs only in the $x$-direction, the specific discharge vector is $\\vec{q} = q\\hat{i}$, where $\\hat{i}$ is the unit vector in the $x$-direction. The divergence operator simplifies to $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{q} = \\frac{dq}{dx}$. Therefore, the mass conservation equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThis ordinary differential equation implies that the specific discharge $q$ is a constant for all $x$ in the domain $[0, L]$.\n\nSecond, we introduce the constitutive relation for creeping flow through a porous medium, which is Darcy's Law. For a homogeneous and isotropic medium, Darcy's Law in one dimension is:\n$$\nq = -K \\frac{dh}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the hydraulic conductivity, which is a constant for a homogeneous medium, and $h(x)$ is the hydraulic head.\n\nThird, we combine the conservation law and the constitutive relation to derive the governing equation for the hydraulic head. Substituting the expression for $q$ from Darcy's Law into the conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-K \\frac{dh}{dx}\\right) = 0\n$$\nBecause the hydraulic conductivity $K$ is constant, it can be factored out of the derivative:\n$$\n-K \\frac{d^2h}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nSince $K$ is a positive constant (a medium must be permeable to have flow), we can divide by $-K$, which yields the governing differential equation for the hydraulic head $h(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2h}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThe complete boundary value problem (BVP) consists of this differential equation and the boundary conditions given in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{d^2h}{dx^2} = 0, & \\text{for } x \\in (0, L) \\\\\nh(0) = h_0 \\\\\nh(L) = h_L\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo solve this BVP, we integrate the governing equation twice with respect to $x$. The first integration yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dx} = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. The second integration gives the general solution for the head:\n$$\nh(x) = C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second integration constant. These constants are determined by applying the boundary conditions.\nUsing the condition at $x=0$:\n$$\nh(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = h_0 \\implies C_2 = h_0\n$$\nThe solution becomes $h(x) = C_1 x + h_0$. Now, applying the condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nh(L) = C_1 L + h_0 = h_L\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 L = h_L - h_0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{h_L - h_0}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution, we obtain the final expression for the hydraulic head profile:\n$$\nh(x) = \\left(\\frac{h_L - h_0}{L}\\right)x + h_0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged as $h(x) = h_0 + (h_L - h_0)\\frac{x}{L}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the constant specific discharge $q$ using Darcy's Law and the result for the head gradient, $\\frac{dh}{dx} = C_1$:\n$$\nq = -K \\frac{dh}{dx} = -K C_1 = -K\\left(\\frac{h_L - h_0}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is more intuitively written by factoring the negative sign into the parentheses:\n$$\nq = K\\frac{h_0 - h_L}{L}\n$$\nThis shows that flow is in the positive $x$-direction ($q > 0$) when $h_0 > h_L$, which is physically correct.\n\nFinally, we determine the seepage velocity $v_s$. The seepage velocity is the average fluid velocity within the pore space and is related to the specific discharge $q$ and the porosity $n$ by the Dupuit-Forchheimer relation, $q = n v_s$. Thus:\n$$\nv_s = \\frac{q}{n}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $q$, we get:\n$$\nv_s = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(K\\frac{h_0 - h_L}{L}\\right) = \\frac{K}{n}\\frac{h_0 - h_L}{L}\n$$\nThe three required quantities are $h(x)$, $q$, and $v_s$.",

            "problem": "A two-dimensional, steady Darcy flow problem models two identical, laterally extensive, horizontal aquifers (upper layer and lower layer), each of thickness $H/2$, separated by a laterally continuous low-permeability aquitard (barrier) of thickness $h_b \\ll H$. Let the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers be $K_h$ and that of the barrier be $K_b \\ll K_h$. Flow is along the horizontal coordinate $x \\in [0,L]$ with $L=H$. Assume the Dupuit approximation holds in each aquifer so that horizontal pressure gradients are uniform across each aquifer thickness, and that vertical exchange across the barrier is governed by one-dimensional Darcy flow through the barrier. Fluids are incompressible, gravitational head is incorporated in the hydraulic head, and capillary effects are negligible.\n\nBoundary conditions are as follows. At the inlet $x=0$, the upper aquifer is held at head $h_1(0)=\\Delta$ and the lower aquifer is no-flow, that is, the alongflow discharge in the lower aquifer vanishes at $x=0$. At the outlet $x=L=H$, both aquifers discharge to the same reservoir at head $h_1(H)=h_2(H)=0$. Define the Darcy number $\\mathrm{Da} := K_b/K_h$ and the thickness ratio $r := h_b/H$.\n\nUsing Darcy’s law and mass conservation as the fundamental starting point, derive from first principles how the throughflow partitions between the upper and lower aquifers and, in particular, obtain an explicit expression for the fraction $f$ of the inlet volumetric flow (injected into the upper aquifer at $x=0$) that leaks through the barrier and exits via the lower aquifer at $x=H$, expressed solely as a function of $\\mathrm{Da}$ and $r$.

No numerical evaluation is required. Express the final answer as a dimensionless fraction without units.",

The derivation starts from the governing equations for each layer, couples them through a leakage term, and solves the resulting system with the given boundary conditions.\n\n**1. Governing Equations**\nLet $h_1(x)$ and $h_2(x)$ be the hydraulic heads in the upper and lower aquifers. The horizontal volumetric flow rates per unit width, $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$, are given by Darcy's law under the Dupuit approximation:\n$$Q_1(x) = -K_h \\frac{H}{2} \\frac{dh_1}{dx}, \\quad Q_2(x) = -K_h \\frac{H}{2} \\frac{dh_2}{dx}$$\nThe vertical leakage flux from the upper to the lower aquifer through the barrier is:\n$$q_v(x) = K_b \\frac{h_1(x) - h_2(x)}{h_b}$$\nSteady-state mass conservation for a differential element $dx$ in each aquifer requires that the change in horizontal flow balances the leakage:\n$$-\\frac{dQ_1}{dx} = q_v(x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -\\frac{dQ_2}{dx} = -q_v(x)$$\nSubstituting the constitutive relations gives a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\\frac{d^2h_1}{dx^2} = \\frac{2K_b}{K_h H h_b}(h_1 - h_2)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2h_2}{dx^2} = -\\frac{2K_b}{K_h H h_b}(h_1 - h_2)$$\n\n**2. Non-dimensionalization and Solution**\nWe introduce a dimensionless length $\\xi = x/H$. Since $L=H$, the domain becomes $\\xi \\in [0,1]$. Let $\\mu^2 = \\frac{4K_b H}{K_h h_b} = \\frac{4\\mathrm{Da}}{r}$.

The flow rates are $Q_i(\\xi) = -\\frac{K_h}{2}\\frac{dh_i}{d\\xi}$.\n- Inlet flow: $Q_{in} = Q_1(0) = -\\frac{K_h}{2}\\frac{dh_1}{d\\xi}(0)$.

All parameters and conditions are clearly specified for a standard numerical simulation of Darcy flow. The problem requires a derivation from first principles followed by a computational implementation, both of which are standard tasks in computational physics and engineering. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Derivation of the Cell-Centered Finite Volume Method\n\nThe problem concerns steady-state, incompressible, single-phase fluid flow through a porous medium. The governing equations are Darcy's law and the mass conservation equation.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principles**\n\n    The volumetric flux vector $\\mathbf{q}$ (with units of $\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$ per $\\mathrm{m}^2$, or $\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$) is given by Darcy's law:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{q} = - \\frac{\\mathbf{K}}{\\mu} \\nabla p\n    $$\n    where $p$ is the fluid pressure in $\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity in $\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\mathbf{K}$ is the permeability tensor in $\\mathrm{m}^2$. For this problem, the tensor is diagonal and aligned with the Cartesian axes: $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathrm{diag}(k_x, k_y)$.\n\n    For steady-state flow with no sources or sinks, the principle of mass conservation is expressed as:\n    $$\n    \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0\n    $$\n    Substituting Darcy's law into the conservation equation yields the governing elliptic partial differential equation for pressure:\n    $$\n    \\nabla \\cdot \\left( - \\frac{\\mathbf{K}}{\\mu} \\nabla p \\right) = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Integral Form and Discretization**\n\n    The Finite Volume Method (FVM) starts by integrating the conservation law over a control volume $V_{i,j}$, which corresponds to a single grid cell. We use a 2D Cartesian grid where cell $(i,j)$ is centered at $(x_i, y_j)$, with $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_x-1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_y-1\\}$. The cell has dimensions $\\Delta x \\times \\Delta y$.\n    $$\n    \\int_{V_{i,j}} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} \\, dV = 0\n    $$\n    Applying the divergence theorem, we convert the volume integral into a surface integral over the boundary $\\partial V_{i,j}$ of the control volume:\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\partial V_{i,j}} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = 0\n    $$\n    where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the cell surface.\n\n    The surface integral is discretized into a sum of total fluxes across the four faces of the rectangular cell (East, West, North, South). Let $Q_f$ be the total volumetric flux ($\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$) outward across a face $f$. The equation for cell $(i,j)$ becomes:\n    $$\n    Q_{E} + Q_{W} + Q_{N} + Q_{S} = 0\n    $$\n    where, for example, $Q_{E}$ is the flux out of the east face, located at $x_{i+1/2} = x_i + \\Delta x/2$. Assuming unit thickness ($1 \\, \\mathrm{m}$), the area of this face is $A_E = \\Delta y \\cdot 1$. The total flux is approximated as the face-normal flux component multiplied by the face area:\n    $$\n    Q_E = A_E (\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_E = \\Delta y \\, (q_x)_{i+1/2, j}\n    $$\n    Similarly, $Q_W = -\\Delta y \\, (q_x)_{i-1/2, j}$, $Q_N = \\Delta x \\, (q_y)_{i, j+1/2}$, and $Q_S = -\\Delta x \\, (q_y)_{i, j-1/2}$. The negative signs for West and South faces arise because the outward normal vectors are in the negative coordinate directions. The conservation equation is then:\n    $$\n    \\Delta y (q_x)_{i+1/2, j} - \\Delta y (q_x)_{i-1/2, j} + \\Delta x (q_y)_{i, j+1/2} - \\Delta x (q_y)_{i, j-1/2} = 0\n    $$\n\n3.  **Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA)**\n\n    TPFA approximates the face-normal flux using only the pressures of the two cells sharing that face. For the east face between cells $(i,j)$ and $(i+1,j)$, the $x$-component of the flux is $q_x = -(k_x/\\mu)(\\partial p / \\partial x)$. We approximate the pressure gradient using a finite difference between the cell centers:\n    $$\n    (q_x)_{i+1/2, j} \\approx - \\left( \\frac{k_x}{\\mu} \\right)_{i+1/2, j} \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - p_{i,j}}{\\Delta x}\n    $$\n    The term $p_{i,j}$ represents the pressure at the center of cell $(i,j)$. The question is how to evaluate the face permeability $(k_x)_{i+1/2, j}$ from the cell-centered permeabilities $k_{x,i,j}$ and $k_{x,i+1,j}$. To ensure flux continuity, the harmonic mean is the correct choice for one-dimensional flow between the cell centers. The effective permeability at the interface that conserves flux is:\n    $$\n    (k_x)_{i+1/2, j} = \\frac{2 \\, k_{x,i,j} \\, k_{x,i+1,j}}{k_{x,i,j} + k_{x,i+1,j}}\n    $$\n    We define a property called **transmissibility**, $T$, which combines geometry, permeability, and viscosity. The total outward flux across the east face is:\n    $$\n    Q_E = \\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{A_E (k_x)_{i+1/2, j}}{\\mu \\Delta x} \\right)}_{T_{i+1/2, j}} (p_{i,j} - p_{i+1,j}) = T_{i+1/2, j} (p_{i,j} - p_{i+1,j})\n    $$\n    The transmissibility for an interior face in the $x$-direction is:\n    $$\n    T_{i+1/2, j} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\mu \\Delta x} \\frac{2 \\, k_{x,i,j} \\, k_{x,i+1,j}}{k_{x,i,j} + k_{x,i+1,j}}\n    $$\n    Similarly, for an interior face in the $y$-direction:\n    $$\n    T_{i, j+1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\mu \\Delta y} \\frac{2 \\, k_{y,i,j} \\, k_{y,i,j+1}}{k_{y,i,j} + k_{y,i,j+1}}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Handling Boundary Conditions**\n\n    -   **No-Flow (Neumann) Boundaries**: At the top ($y=L_y$, cells $j=N_y-1$) and bottom ($y=0$, cells $j=0$) boundaries, the flux is zero. This is enforced by setting the transmissibility of these boundary faces to zero. For example, for a cell $(i,0)$, $T_{i,-1/2} = 0$.\n\n    -   **Prescribed Pressure (Dirichlet) Boundaries**: At the left ($x=0$) and right ($x=L_x$) boundaries, the pressure is known. For a cell $(0,j)$ at the left boundary, the flux across its west face at $x_{-1/2}$ depends on the boundary pressure $p_\\mathrm{left}$. The distance from the cell center to the boundary is $\\Delta x/2$. The flux approximation is:\n    $$\n    (q_x)_{-1/2, j} \\approx - \\frac{k_{x,0,j}}{\\mu} \\frac{p_{0,j} - p_\\mathrm{left}}{\\Delta x/2}\n    $$\n    Note we only use the permeability of the cell itself, $k_{x,0,j}$. The total outward flux is $Q_W = T_{-1/2,j}(p_{0,j} - p_\\mathrm{left})$, with the boundary transmissibility defined as:\n    $$\n    T_{-1/2, j} = \\frac{A_W k_{x,0,j}}{\\mu (\\Delta x/2)} = \\frac{2 \\Delta y \\, k_{x,0,j}}{\\mu \\Delta x}\n    $$\n    Similarly, for a cell $(N_x-1,j)$ at the right boundary, the transmissibility is $T_{N_x-1/2, j} = \\frac{2 \\Delta y \\, k_{x,N_x-1,j}}{\\mu \\Delta x}$, and the flux contribution involves $p_\\mathrm{right}$.\n\n5.  **Assembly of the Linear System**\n\n    The mass balance for an interior cell $(i,j)$ is:\n    $$\n    T_{i+1/2, j}(p_{i,j} - p_{i+1,j}) + T_{i-1/2, j}(p_{i,j} - p_{i-1,j}) + T_{i,j+1/2}(p_{i,j} - p_{i,j+1}) + T_{i,j-1/2}(p_{i,j} - p_{i,j-1}) = 0\n    $$\n    This can be rearranged to form a linear equation for the unknown pressure $p_{i,j}$:\n    $$\n    (\\sum_{f} T_f) p_{i,j} - \\sum_{f} T_f p_{\\text{neighbor}} = 0\n    $$\n    where the sum is over the four faces. For a boundary cell, terms involving known boundary pressures are moved to the right-hand side (RHS). For example, for cell $(0,j)$:\n    $$\n    (T_{1/2,j} + T_{-1/2,j} + \\dots) p_{0,j} - T_{1/2,j}p_{1,j} - \\dots = T_{-1/2,j} p_\\mathrm{left}\n    $$\n    By applying this equation to every cell in the grid, we construct a system of $N = N_x \\times N_y$ linear equations for the $N$ unknown cell pressures. This system can be written in matrix form as $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{p}$ is the vector of unknown cell pressures, $\\mathbf{A}$ is a sparse, symmetric positive-definite matrix of coefficients, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the source vector containing contributions from Dirichlet boundaries. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is pentadiagonal when using a natural row- or column-wise ordering of cells.\n\n6.  **Mass Balance Residual Calculation**\n\n    After solving the system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the solution vector $\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{sol}}$, we can verify the quality of the solution by computing the local mass balance residual for each cell. The discrete conservation law for cell $k$ is $(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{p})_k = b_k$. The residual is the amount by which the numerical solution fails to satisfy this equation, defined as $r_k = (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{sol}})_k - b_k$. Physically, this corresponds to the net mass flow into/out of a cell based on the computed pressure field minus any explicit sources. For an exact solution, this residual would be zero. Due to finite-precision arithmetic, it will be a small number. The maximum absolute residual, $\\max_k |r_k|$, is a measure of the overall consistency of the numerical solution.",
