            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum kinematics, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard formal exercise in deriving fundamental kinematic quantities from a given deformation mapping.\n\nThe problem describes a deformation mapping $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}$ from reference coordinates $\\mathbf{X} = (X, Y)$ to current coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y)$. The mapping is given by:\n$$\nx = X + \\gamma Y\n$$\n$$\ny = \\lambda Y\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ and $\\lambda$ are real constants.\n\nThe first task is to derive the deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}$. By definition, the deformation gradient is the gradient of the current position vector $\\mathbf{x}$ with respect to the reference position vector $\\mathbf{X}$. In Cartesian coordinates, its components $F_{ij}$ are given by $F_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial X_j}$. In this two-dimensional case, we have $x_1 = x$, $x_2 = y$, $X_1 = X$, and $X_2 = Y$. The components of $\\mathbf{F}$ are therefore:\n\n$F_{11} = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial X} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} (X + \\gamma Y) = 1$\n$F_{12} = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial Y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Y} (X + \\gamma Y) = \\gamma$\n$F_{21} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial X} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} (\\lambda Y) = 0$\n$F_{22} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial Y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Y} (\\lambda Y) = \\lambda$\n\nAssembling these components into a $2 \\times 2$ matrix gives the deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial X} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial Y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial X} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial Y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\gamma \\\\ 0 & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to derive the Jacobian determinant $J$. The Jacobian $J$ is the determinant of the deformation gradient matrix $\\mathbf{F}$. It represents the local volume (or area, in $2$D) ratio between the current and reference configurations.\n$$\nJ = \\det(\\mathbf{F}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\gamma \\\\ 0 & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nCalculating the determinant of this $2 \\times 2$ matrix:\n$$\nJ = (1)(\\lambda) - (\\gamma)(0) = \\lambda\n$$\nThe Jacobian of the transformation is thus simply the stretch factor $\\lambda$. This is physically consistent, as the simple shear component of the deformation does not alter the area of a differential element.\n\nThe third task is to assess the invertibility of the mapping $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}$ and find its inverse $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x})$ if it exists. A differentiable mapping is locally invertible if and only if its Jacobian determinant is non-zero. In this case, the condition for invertibility is:\n$$\nJ = \\lambda \\neq 0\n$$\nAssuming this condition holds, we can find the inverse mapping by solving for the reference coordinates $(X, Y)$ in terms of the current coordinates $(x, y)$. We start with the system of equations for the mapping:\n1. $x = X + \\gamma Y$\n2. $y = \\lambda Y$\n\nFrom equation (2), since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, we can solve for $Y$:\n$$\nY = \\frac{y}{\\lambda}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $Y$ into equation (1):\n$$\nx = X + \\gamma \\left(\\frac{y}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $X$:\n$$\nX = x - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\lambda} y\n$$\nThus, the inverse mapping $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}^{-1}$ that maps a point $(x, y)$ in the current configuration back to its original position $(X, Y)$ in the reference configuration is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\chi}^{-1}(x, y) = \\left( x - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\lambda} y, \\frac{1}{\\lambda} y \\right)\n$$\nAs requested, this can be written as a column vector:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\chi}^{-1}(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\lambda} y \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis completes all three tasks. The final answer will consist of the derived expressions for $\\mathbf{F}$, $J$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}^{-1}$ arranged in a row matrix.",

The tasks involve applying well-established definitions (velocity gradient, its symmetric/skew-symmetric decomposition, and tensor invariants) to this field.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins with the given velocity field, $\\mathbf{v}$. In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with basis vectors $\\mathbf{e}_x$ and $\\mathbf{e}_y$, the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ has components $v_x = \\omega y$ and $v_y = -\\omega x$.\n\n**1. Velocity Gradient Tensor and its Trace**\n\nThe velocity gradient tensor, denoted by $\\mathbf{l}$, is defined by its components $l_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}$, where $x_i$ represents the spatial coordinates. For this two-dimensional problem, we let $(x_1, x_2)$ be $(x, y)$.\n\nThe components of $\\mathbf{l}$ are computed as follows:\n$l_{11} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\omega y) = 0$\n$l_{12} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\omega y) = \\omega$\n$l_{21} = \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\omega x) = -\\omega$\n$l_{22} = \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\omega x) = 0$\n\nIn matrix form, the velocity gradient tensor is:\n$$ \\mathbf{l} = \\begin{pmatrix} l_{11} & l_{12} \\\\ l_{21} & l_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\omega \\\\ -\\omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe trace of a tensor is the sum of its diagonal components. The trace of $\\mathbf{l}$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{l}) = l_{11} + l_{22} = 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nIn continuum mechanics, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{l}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$, which represents the rate of volumetric expansion. Since $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{l}) = 0$, the flow is incompressible, meaning there is no change in the volume of a material element as it moves with the flow.\n\n**2. Rate-of-Deformation and Spin Tensors**\n\nThe velocity gradient tensor $\\mathbf{l}$ can be uniquely decomposed into a symmetric part and a skew-symmetric part. The symmetric part is the rate-of-deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$, and the skew-symmetric part is the spin tensor $\\mathbf{W}$.\n\nThe rate-of-deformation tensor is defined from first principles as $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{l} + \\mathbf{l}^T)$. First, we find the transpose of $\\mathbf{l}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{l}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\omega \\\\ \\omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute $\\mathbf{D}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\omega \\\\ -\\omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\omega \\\\ \\omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0+0 & \\omega+(-\\omega) \\\\ -\\omega+\\omega & 0+0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, the rate-of-deformation tensor is the zero tensor, $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe spin tensor is defined as $\\mathbf{W} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{l} - \\mathbf{l}^T)$. We compute $\\mathbf{W}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{W} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\omega \\\\ -\\omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\omega \\\\ \\omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0-0 & \\omega-(-\\omega) \\\\ -\\omega-\\omega & 0-0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2\\omega \\\\ -2\\omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\omega \\\\ -\\omega & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNote that $\\mathbf{D} + \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{l}$, which verifies the decomposition.\n\n**3. Classification of the Motion**\n\nThe kinematics of a continuum at a point are described by the decomposition $\\mathbf{l} = \\mathbf{D} + \\mathbf{W}$.\n- The tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ quantifies the rate of change of shape (stretching and shearing) of a material element.\n- The tensor $\\mathbf{W}$ quantifies the rate of rigid-body rotation (vorticity) of the material element.\n\nIn this case, we found that $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{0}$. This signifies that there is no stretching or angular deformation occurring anywhere in the flow. The distances between material points do not change.\nConversely, the spin tensor $\\mathbf{W}$ is non-zero (for $\\omega \\neq 0$). This signifies that the material elements are rotating.\nSince the deformation rate is zero and the spin is non-zero, the motion is classified as a pure **rigid-body rotation**. This result is consistent with the physical description of the velocity field as representing a rigidly rotating block of lithosphere.\n\n**4. Second Invariant of the Rate-of-Deformation Tensor**\n\nThe problem asks for the scalar invariant $I_2^D = \\mathbf{D}:\\mathbf{D}$. This is the Frobenius inner product (or double-dot product) of the rate-of-deformation tensor with itself. It is defined as $I_2^D = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} D_{ij} D_{ij}$. This invariant provides a scalar measure of the magnitude of the deformation rate.\n\nUsing the components of the computed tensor $\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$D_{11}=0$, $D_{12}=0$, $D_{21}=0$, $D_{22}=0$.\n\nThe invariant is calculated as:\n$$ I_2^D = D_{11}^2 + D_{12}^2 + D_{21}^2 + D_{22}^2 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 0 $$\nThe constant $\\omega$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The components of $\\mathbf{D}$ have the same units. Therefore, the invariant $I_2^D$, being a sum of squares of the components of $\\mathbf{D}$, has units of $(\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^2 = \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. The value of the invariant is $0 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.",

Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation:**\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental principle of the invariance of internal power. The rate of work done by internal forces per unit volume, or power density, must be independent of the configuration (reference or current) used for its calculation.\n\nThe power per unit volume in the current (deformed) configuration is given by the double dot product of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the rate of deformation tensor $\\mathbf{d}$:\n$$ \\dot{w} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{d} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{d}$ is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient $\\mathbf{l} = \\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1}$, i.e., $\\mathbf{d} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{l} + \\mathbf{l}^T)$.\n\nThe power per unit volume in the reference (undeformed) configuration, $\\dot{W}$, is related to $\\dot{w}$ by the determinant of the deformation gradient, $J = \\det(\\mathbf{F})$, which represents the ratio of current volume to reference volume.\n$$ \\dot{W} = J \\dot{w} = J (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{d}) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{d}$:\n$$ \\dot{W} = J \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1} + \\mathbf{F}^{-T}\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}^T) $$\nSince the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is symmetric ($\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T$), its contraction with any second-order tensor is equal to its contraction with the symmetric part of that tensor. Therefore, we can write:\n$$ \\dot{W} = J \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : (\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1}) $$\nUsing the identity for the trace operator $(\\mathbf{A}:\\mathbf{B} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}^T\\mathbf{B}))$ and its cyclic property, we have $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:(\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T \\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\dot{\\mathbf{F}})$. The last term is equivalent to the contraction $(\\mathbf{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})^T:\\dot{\\mathbf{F}} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T\\mathbf{F}^{-T}):\\dot{\\mathbf{F}} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{F}^{-T}):\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}$. Thus:\n$$ \\dot{W} = (J \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{F}^{-T}) : \\dot{\\mathbf{F}} $$\nThe power per unit reference volume is also defined in terms of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $\\mathbf{P}$ and the rate of the deformation gradient $\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}$:\n$$ \\dot{W} = \\mathbf{P} : \\dot{\\mathbf{F}} $$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $\\dot{W}$, we see that this equality must hold for any arbitrary rate of deformation $\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}$. This yields the fundamental relationship between $\\mathbf{P}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{P} = J \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{F}^{-T} $$\nThis completes the derivation of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress. Note that $\\mathbf{P}$ is generally not symmetric.\n\nNext, we derive the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $\\mathbf{S}$. This stress measure is defined such that it is related to $\\mathbf{P}$ by the transformation $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{S}$. Substituting this definition into the relationship for $\\mathbf{P}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{S} = J \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{F}^{-T} $$\nPre-multiplying by $\\mathbf{F}^{-1}$ gives the expression for $\\mathbf{S}$ in terms of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} = J \\mathbf{F}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{F}^{-T} $$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is symmetric, $\\mathbf{S}$ is also symmetric.\n\nTo identify the work-conjugate strain measure to $\\mathbf{S}$, we consider the Green-Lagrange strain tensor $\\mathbf{E}$, defined as:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{F}^T\\mathbf{F} - \\mathbf{I}) $$\nIts time rate is:\n$$ \\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}^T\\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{F}^T\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}) $$\nNow, let's form the power expression using $\\mathbf{S}$ and $\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\mathbf{S} : \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}^T\\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{F}^T\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}) $$\nDue to the symmetry of $\\mathbf{S}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\mathbf{S} : (\\mathbf{F}^T\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}) = (\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{S}) : \\dot{\\mathbf{F}} $$\nSince we defined $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{S}$, we find:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\mathbf{P} : \\dot{\\mathbf{F}} $$\nAs $\\mathbf{P} : \\dot{\\mathbf{F}}$ is the power per unit reference volume $\\dot{W}$, we have $\\dot{W} = \\mathbf{S} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}}$. By definition, this demonstrates that the **second Piola-Kirchhoff stress $\\mathbf{S}$ is energetically conjugate to the Green-Lagrange strain $\\mathbf{E}$**.\n\nFinally, we apply these general results to the specific state given in the problem. The deformation gradient and Cauchy stress are given as diagonal matrices:\n$$ \\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_{3} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe inverse and inverse-transpose of $\\mathbf{F}$ are:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_{2}^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_{3}^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{F}^{-T} = (\\mathbf{F}^{-1})^T = \\mathbf{F}^{-1} $$\nNow, we compute the components of $\\mathbf{P}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{P} = J \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{F}^{-T} = (\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3}) \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_{2}^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_{3}^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{P} = (\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3}) \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1}\\lambda_{1}^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2}\\lambda_{2}^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3}\\lambda_{3}^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2}\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3}\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe principal components of $\\mathbf{P}$ are:\n$P_{11} = \\sigma_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3} = J \\sigma_{1} \\lambda_{1}^{-1}$\n$P_{22} = \\sigma_{2}\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{3} = J \\sigma_{2} \\lambda_{2}^{-1}$\n$P_{33} = \\sigma_{3}\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2} = J \\sigma_{3} \\lambda_{3}^{-1}$\n\nNext, we compute the components of $\\mathbf{S}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} = J \\mathbf{F}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{F}^{-T} = J \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_{2}^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_{3}^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_{2}^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_{3}^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{S} = J \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1}\\lambda_{1}^{-2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2}\\lambda_{2}^{-2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3}\\lambda_{3}^{-2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe principal components of $\\mathbf{S}$ are:\n$S_{11} = J \\sigma_{1} \\lambda_{1}^{-2}$\n$S_{22} = J \\sigma_{2} \\lambda_{2}^{-2}$\n$S_{33} = J \\sigma_{3} \\lambda_{3}^{-2}$\n\nThe final answer is the row vector of these components.",
