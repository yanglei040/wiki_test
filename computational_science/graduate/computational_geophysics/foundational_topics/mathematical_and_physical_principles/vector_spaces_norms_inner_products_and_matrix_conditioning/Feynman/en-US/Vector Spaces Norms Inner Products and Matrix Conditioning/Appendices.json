We discretize the domain $[0,L]$ with $n$ interior points $x_i = i h$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$, where the grid spacing is $h = L/(n+1)$. The values of the function at these points are denoted by $u_i = u(x_i)$. The boundary conditions are $u_0 = u(0) = 0$ and $u_{n+1} = u(L) = 0$.\n\nWe use second-order central difference approximations for the derivatives at an interior point $x_i$:\n$$\nu'(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_{i-1}}{2h}\n$$\n$$\nu''(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ gives the discrete operator at node $i$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}u)_i \\approx -k \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2} \\right) + v \\left( \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_{i-1}}{2h} \\right)\n$$\nWe rearrange the terms to group coefficients of $u_{i-1}$, $u_i$, and $u_{i+1}$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}u)_i \\approx \\left( -\\frac{k}{h^2} - \\frac{v}{2h} \\right) u_{i-1} + \\left( \\frac{2k}{h^2} \\right) u_i + \\left( -\\frac{k}{h^2} + \\frac{v}{2h} \\right) u_{i+1}\n$$\nThis expression defines the $i$-th row of the matrix-vector product $A U$, where $U = [u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n]^T$. The matrix $A$ is therefore a tridiagonal matrix. The entries are constant along the diagonals (a Toeplitz structure), defined as:\n- Sub-diagonal ($a=A_{i, i-1}$): $a = -\\frac{k}{h^2} - \\frac{v}{2h}$\n- Main diagonal ($d=A_{i, i}$): $d = \\frac{2k}{h^2}$\n- Super-diagonal ($c=A_{i, i+1}$): $c = -\\frac{k}{h^2} + \\frac{v}{2h}$\n\nThe $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ has the form:\n$$\nA =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nd & c & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\na & d & c & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & a & d & \\ddots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & c \\\\\n0 & \\dots & 0 & a & d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAt the boundaries ($i=1$ and $i=n$), the terms involving $u_0$ and $u_{n+1}$ are dropped because $u_0=0$ and $u_{n+1}=0$, which is correctly represented by the tridiagonal structure shown above.\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values: $k=2.5$, $v=0.7$, $L=1$, and $n=9$.\nFirst, calculate the grid spacing $h$:\n$$\nh = \\frac{L}{n+1} = \\frac{1}{9+1} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\n$$\nNow, calculate the matrix entries $a$, $d$, and $c$:\n$$\nd = \\frac{2k}{h^2} = \\frac{2(2.5)}{(0.1)^2} = \\frac{5}{0.01} = 500\n$$\n$$\na = -\\frac{k}{h^2} - \\frac{v}{2h} = -\\frac{2.5}{(0.1)^2} - \\frac{0.7}{2(0.1)} = -250 - \\frac{0.7}{0.2} = -250 - 3.5 = -253.5\n$$\n$$\nc = -\\frac{k}{h^2} + \\frac{v}{2h} = -\\frac{2.5}{(0.1)^2} + \\frac{0.7}{2(0.1)} = -250 + 3.5 = -246.5\n$$\nWe need to find the matrix norms $\\|A\\|_{\\infty}$ and $\\|A\\|_{1}$.\n\nThe infinity-norm, $\\|A\\|_{\\infty}$, is the maximum absolute row sum.\n- For the first row ($i=1$): $\\sum_{j} |A_{1j}| = |d| + |c| = |500| + |-246.5| = 500 + 246.5 = 746.5$.\n- For an interior row ($1 < i < n$): $\\sum_{j} |A_{ij}| = |a| + |d| + |c| = |-253.5| + |500| + |-246.5| = 253.5 + 500 + 246.5 = 1000$.\n- For the last row ($i=n$): $\\sum_{j} |A_{nj}| = |a| + |d| = |-253.5| + |500| = 253.5 + 500 = 753.5$.\n\nThe maximum of these values is $\\|A\\|_{\\infty}$:\n$$\n\\|A\\|_{\\infty} = \\max(746.5, 1000, 753.5) = 1000\n$$\n\nThe $1$-norm, $\\|A\\|_{1}$, is the maximum absolute column sum.\n- For the first column ($j=1$): $\\sum_{i} |A_{i1}| = |d| + |a| = |500| + |-253.5| = 500 + 253.5 = 753.5$.\n- For an interior column ($1 < j < n$): $\\sum_{i} |A_{ij}| = |c| + |d| + |a| = |-246.5| + |500| + |-253.5| = 246.5 + 500 + 253.5 = 1000$.\n- For the last column ($j=n$): $\\sum_{i} |A_{in}| = |c| + |d| = |-246.5| + |500| = 246.5 + 500 = 746.5$.\n\nThe maximum of these values is $\\|A\\|_{1}$:\n$$\n\\|A\\|_{1} = \\max(753.5, 1000, 746.5) = 1000\n$$\n\nThe required pair is $(\\|A\\|_{1}, \\|A\\|_{\\infty})$.\nBoth norms are equal to $1000$.\nThe pair is $(1000, 1000)$.",

It is a standard exercise in linear algebra applied to a common operator in computational science. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe kernel, or null space, of a linear operator $G$, denoted $\\ker(G)$, is the set of all vectors $u$ in the domain of $G$ that are mapped to the zero vector. The domain of $G$ is $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and its codomain is $\\mathbb{R}^{(n-1)}$. Therefore, the kernel is defined as:\n$$\n\\ker(G) = \\{ u \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid Gu = 0_{\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}} \\}\n$$\nHere, $0_{\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}$ is the zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{(n-1)}$.\n\nLet $u$ be a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, with components $u = (u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n)^T$. The condition for $u$ to be in the kernel of $G$ is $Gu = 0_{\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}}$. This translates to a system of $n-1$ linear equations, based on the definition of the operator $G$:\n$$\n(Gu)_i = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad i = 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\n$$\nUsing the given definition $(Gu)_{i} = u_{i+1} - u_{i}$, the system of equations becomes:\n$$\nu_{i+1} - u_{i} = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad i = 1, 2, \\dots, n-1\n$$\nThis implies $u_{i+1} = u_i$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$. Let's write out these equations explicitly:\n\\begin{align*}\nu_2 - u_1 &= 0 \\implies u_2 = u_1 \\\\\nu_3 - u_2 &= 0 \\implies u_3 = u_2 \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\nu_n - u_{n-1} &= 0 \\implies u_n = u_{n-1}\n\\end{align*}\nFrom this sequence of equalities, we can conclude that all components of the vector $u$ must be equal to each other:\n$$\nu_1 = u_2 = u_3 = \\dots = u_n\n$$\nLet this common value be $c$, where $c$ is an arbitrary scalar in $\\mathbb{R}$. Then any vector $u \\in \\ker(G)$ must be of the form:\n$$\nu = \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ c \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix} = c \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the kernel of $G$ is the set of all scalar multiples of the vector of all ones. In other words, $\\ker(G)$ is the subspace spanned by this single vector. Let's define this vector as $v$:\n$$\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\n$$\nSo, we can write the kernel as $\\ker(G) = \\text{span}\\{v\\}$.\n\nA basis for a vector space is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans the space.\n1.  **Spanning**: By our derivation, the set $\\{v\\}$ spans $\\ker(G)$.\n2.  **Linear Independence**: A set containing a single non-zero vector is, by definition, linearly independent. Since $v$ is clearly not the zero vector, the set $\\{v\\}$ is linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, the set $\\{v\\}$ is a basis for $\\ker(G)$.\n\nThe dimension of a vector space is defined as the number of vectors in any of its bases. Since the basis we constructed for $\\ker(G)$ contains exactly one vector, the dimension of the kernel is $1$.\n$$\n\\dim(\\ker(G)) = 1\n$$\nThe problem asks for a basis and the dimension. A basis is the set containing the vector $v = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)^T$, and the dimension is $1$. We will present these two pieces of information as a single mathematical object as requested.",

We may therefore proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nThe objective is to find an upper bound for the $2$-norm condition number, $\\kappa_2(A)$, of the matrix $A = k\\,T + \\gamma\\,I$. The matrix $A$ is defined in the real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \\ge 3$, with parameters $k > 0$, $\\gamma > 0$, and grid spacing $h > 0$.\n\nThe matrix $T$ is given as a real symmetric matrix.

The $2$-norm condition number is defined as $\\kappa_2(A) = \\|A\\|_2 \\|A^{-1}\\|_2$.\n\nBefore proceeding, we must establish that $A$ is invertible and, more specifically, positive definite. Let $\\mu_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, n$ be the eigenvalues of the matrix $T$. If $v_j$ is an eigenvector of $T$ corresponding to $\\mu_j$, then\n$$\nA v_j = (k\\,T + \\gamma\\,I) v_j = k(T v_j) + \\gamma(I v_j) = k(\\mu_j v_j) + \\gamma v_j = (k\\mu_j + \\gamma)v_j.\n$$\nThus, the eigenvalues of $A$ are given by $\\lambda_j(A) = k\\mu_j + \\gamma$.\n\nTo determine the signs of these eigenvalues, we must bound the eigenvalues of $T$.

The sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements, $R_i$, is $R_1 = |-1/h^2| = 1/h^2$ for the first row, $R_n = |-1/h^2| = 1/h^2$ for the last row, and $R_i = |-1/h^2| + |-1/h^2| = 2/h^2$ for any interior row $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nGershgorin's theorem states that every eigenvalue of $T$ lies within the union of the disks $D(t_{ii}, R_i)$ in the complex plane. Since $T$ is symmetric, its eigenvalues are real. The union of the Gershgorin intervals is:\n$$\n\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ \\frac{2}{h^2} - R_i, \\frac{2}{h^2} + R_i \\right].\n$$\nThe widest interval corresponds to the interior rows, where $R_i = 2/h^2$. This gives the interval $[\\frac{2}{h^2} - \\frac{2}{h^2}, \\frac{2}{h^2} + \\frac{2}{h^2}] = [0, 4/h^2]$. Thus, all eigenvalues $\\mu_j$ of $T$ satisfy $0 \\le \\mu_j \\le 4/h^2$.\n\nFurthermore, the matrix $T$ is irreducible because its associated graph (a path graph on $n$ vertices) is connected. For rows $i=1$ and $i=n$, the Gershgorin disks are strictly contained within the right half-plane as the diagonal dominance is strict: $|t_{11}| > R_1$. A matrix that is irreducibly diagonally dominant with positive real diagonal entries is nonsingular. Since the eigenvalues $\\mu_j$ are confined to $[0, 4/h^2]$ and $0$ is not an eigenvalue, we must have $\\mu_j > 0$ for all $j$. Therefore, $T$ is a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix.\n\nSince $k > 0$, the matrix $k\\,T$ is also SPD. Since $\\gamma > 0$, the matrix $\\gamma\\,I$ is also SPD. The sum of two SPD matrices is SPD. Consequently, $A$ is SPD, and all its eigenvalues $\\lambda_j(A)$ are strictly positive.\n\nFor an SPD matrix, the condition number simplifies to $\\kappa_2(A) = \\lambda_{\\max}(A) / \\lambda_{\\min}(A)$. Our task is now to find an upper bound for $\\lambda_{\\max}(A)$ and a lower bound for $\\lambda_{\\min}(A)$.\n\nAn upper bound for the maximum eigenvalue of $A$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A) = k\\mu_{\\max}(T) + \\gamma.\n$$\nFrom the Gershgorin analysis of $T$, we have $\\mu_{\\max}(T) \\le 4/h^2$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\lambda_{\\max}(A)$ yields:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A) \\le k\\left(\\frac{4}{h^2}\\right) + \\gamma = \\frac{4k}{h^2} + \\gamma.\n$$\n\nA lower bound for the minimum eigenvalue of $A$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min}(A) = k\\mu_{\\min}(T) + \\gamma.\n$$\nSince we have established that $T$ is SPD, its minimum eigenvalue $\\mu_{\\min}(T)$ is strictly positive, i.e., $\\mu_{\\min}(T) > 0$. As $k$ is also strictly positive ($k > 0$), the product $k\\mu_{\\min}(T)$ is also strictly positive. This provides a strict lower bound for $\\lambda_{\\min}(A)$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min}(A) = k\\mu_{\\min}(T) + \\gamma > \\gamma.\n$$\nThus, $\\gamma$ serves as a certified lower bound for $\\lambda_{\\min}(A)$.\n\nFinally, we can construct the upper bound for the condition number $\\kappa_2(A)$ by dividing the upper bound for $\\lambda_{\\max}(A)$ by the lower bound for $\\lambda_{\\min}(A)$:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(A) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}(A)}{\\lambda_{\\min}(A)} \\le \\frac{\\frac{4k}{h^2} + \\gamma}{\\gamma}.\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final certified closed-form upper bound:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(A) \\le \\frac{4k}{\\gamma h^2} + 1.\n$$\nThis bound depends explicitly on $k$, $\\gamma$, and $h$ as required by the problem statement, and was derived using only the permitted structural properties and theorems.",
