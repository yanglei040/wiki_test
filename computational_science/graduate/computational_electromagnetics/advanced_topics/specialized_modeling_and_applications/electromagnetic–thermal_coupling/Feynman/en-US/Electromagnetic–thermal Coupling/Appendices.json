This first practice explores a foundational scenario in electromagnetic heating: the thermal response of a material to a sudden, sustained influx of high-frequency EM energy. By modeling the EM absorption as an effective surface heat flux, we can derive an exact solution for the temperature evolution, offering clear insights into the fundamental process of thermal diffusion and establishing a characteristic time scale for heat to penetrate beyond the initial absorption region .",

            "problem": "A semi-infinite lossy medium occupies $x>0$ and is initially at a uniform temperature $T(x,0)=T_{0}$. At time $t=0$, a high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) wave of fixed amplitude is switched on and maintained for $t>0$. Due to strong absorption within a shallow electromagnetic attenuation depth $\\ell_{\\mathrm{em}}$ near $x=0$, the electromagnetic (EM) energy deposition can be modeled, for early to intermediate times, as an effective step surface heat flux per unit area\n$$q''(t)=Q_{0} H(t),$$\nwhere $Q_{0}>0$ is a constant and $H(t)$ is the Heaviside unit step function. Neglect convective and radiative losses at the boundary and assume the following thermophysical properties are constant: density $\\rho$, specific heat $c$, and thermal conductivity $k$. Let the thermal diffusivity be $\\alpha=k/(\\rho c)$.\n\nStarting from the one-dimensional heat equation and the appropriate boundary and initial conditions, derive the closed-form expression for the surface temperature evolution $T_{s}(t)=T(0,t)$ for $t>0$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated constitutes a well-posed initial-boundary value problem in the field of heat transfer. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. We may therefore proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe physical system is a semi-infinite solid ($x>0$) governed by the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}, \\quad \\text{for } x>0, t>0\n$$\nwhere $T(x,t)$ is the temperature, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c)$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe initial condition is a uniform temperature $T_0$:\n$$\nT(x,0) = T_0, \\quad \\text{for } x>0\n$$\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. A constant heat flux $Q_0$ is applied at the surface $x=0$ for $t>0$. This is a Neumann boundary condition, derived from Fourier's law of heat conduction, $q'' = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$.\n$$\n-k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}(0, t) = Q_0, \\quad \\text{for } t>0\n$$\n2. Far from the surface, the temperature remains undisturbed at its initial value.\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} T(x,t) = T_0, \\quad \\text{for } t>0\n$$\n\nTo simplify the problem, we introduce an excess temperature variable $\\theta(x,t) = T(x,t) - T_0$. The problem can be rewritten in terms of $\\theta(x,t)$:\nPDE: $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}$\nIC: $\\theta(x,0) = 0$\nBC1: $-k \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}(0, t) = Q_0$\nBC2: $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\theta(x,t) = 0$\n\nThis partial differential equation can be solved using the Laplace transform method. Let $\\bar{\\theta}(x,s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\theta(x,t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\theta(x,t) \\exp(-st) dt$. Applying the Laplace transform to the PDE gives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $x$:\n$$\ns\\bar{\\theta}(x,s) - \\theta(x,0) = \\alpha \\frac{d^2\\bar{\\theta}}{dx^2}\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $\\theta(x,0)=0$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\bar{\\theta}}{dx^2} - \\frac{s}{\\alpha}\\bar{\\theta} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this ODE is:\n$$\n\\bar{\\theta}(x,s) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}x\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}x\\right)\n$$\nThe transformed boundary conditions are:\nBC1: $-k \\frac{d\\bar{\\theta}}{dx}(0,s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{Q_0\\} = \\frac{Q_0}{s}$\nBC2: $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\bar{\\theta}(x,s) = 0$\n\nTo satisfy BC2, the coefficient $C_1$ must be zero, since $\\exp(\\sqrt{s/\\alpha}x)$ is unbounded as $x \\to \\infty$ for $\\text{Re}(s)>0$. Thus, the solution is of the form:\n$$\n\\bar{\\theta}(x,s) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}x\\right)\n$$\nTo find $C_2$, we apply BC1. First, we compute the derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{\\theta}}{dx}(x,s) = -C_2 \\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}} \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}x\\right)\n$$\nAt $x=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{\\theta}}{dx}(0,s) = -C_2 \\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the transformed BC1:\n$$\n-k \\left(-C_2 \\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}\\right) = \\frac{Q_0}{s}\n$$\n$$\nk C_2 \\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}} = \\frac{Q_0}{s}\n$$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$\nC_2 = \\frac{Q_0}{k s \\sqrt{s/\\alpha}} = \\frac{Q_0 \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{k s^{3/2}}\n$$\nThe solution for the temperature in the Laplace domain is therefore:\n$$\n\\bar{\\theta}(x,s) = \\frac{Q_0 \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{k s^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}x\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the surface temperature, $T_s(t) = T(0,t)$, which corresponds to $\\theta_s(t) = \\theta(0,t)$. We find its Laplace transform by setting $x=0$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\theta}_s(s) = \\bar{\\theta}(0,s) = \\frac{Q_0 \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{k s^{3/2}}\n$$\nTo find $\\theta_s(t)$, we must compute the inverse Laplace transform of $\\bar{\\theta}_s(s)$. We use the standard Laplace transform pair:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{t^n\\} = \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{s^{n+1}} \\implies \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}}\\right\\} = \\frac{t^n}{\\Gamma(n+1)}\n$$\nIn our case, $n+1 = 3/2$, which means $n=1/2$. The gamma function value is $\\Gamma(3/2) = (1/2)\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}/2$.\nTherefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s^{3/2}}\\right\\} = \\frac{t^{1/2}}{\\Gamma(3/2)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{t}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}/2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{t}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nApplying this to our expression for $\\bar{\\theta}_s(s)$:\n$$\n\\theta_s(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{Q_0 \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{k s^{3/2}}\\right\\} = \\frac{Q_0 \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{k} \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s^{3/2}}\\right\\} = \\frac{Q_0 \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{k} \\frac{2\\sqrt{t}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_s(t) = \\frac{2Q_0}{k} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha t}{\\pi}}\n$$\nFinally, we convert back to the physical temperature $T_s(t)$ using $T_s(t) = T_0 + \\theta_s(t)$:\n$$\nT_s(t) = T_0 + \\frac{2Q_0}{k} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha t}{\\pi}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the surface temperature evolution.\n\nRegarding the second part of the query, the characteristic thermal diffusion time scale $t_{\\mathrm{th}}$ can be identified by inspecting the physics of the solution. The complete solution $T(x,t)$ (not just at the surface) demonstrates that the characteristic length scale for heat diffusion into the medium is $\\delta_{\\mathrm{th}} \\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha t}$. This can be seen from the arguments of the exponential and error functions that appear in the full solution $\\theta(x,t)$. The problem asks for the time $t_{\\mathrm{th}}$ when this thermal diffusion depth becomes comparable to the electromagnetic attenuation depth $\\ell_{\\mathrm{em}}$. By setting $\\delta_{\\mathrm{th}}(t_{\\mathrm{th}}) \\approx \\ell_{\\mathrm{em}}$, we have:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\alpha t_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\sim \\ell_{\\mathrm{em}} \\implies t_{\\mathrm{th}} \\sim \\frac{\\ell_{\\mathrm{em}}^2}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis time scale represents the transition from a regime where heat is confined within the EM absorption layer to a regime where it has diffused significantly beyond it. However, the final answer required is only the expression for $T_s(t)$.",

The task is to perform a numerical verification of discrete energy conservation for a one-dimensional electromagnetic–thermal coupling problem using the Finite Volume Method (FVM).\n\nThe physical principle underpinning this problem is the conservation of energy, which, for a system involving heat conduction and volumetric heat generation, is described by the heat equation. In one dimension ($x$), for a material with density $\\rho$, specific heat $c$, and thermal conductivity $k$, the temperature field $T(x,t)$ evolves according to:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) + S\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the volumetric heat source density.

Compute the discrete divergence of thermal flux, $\\left[\\nabla\\cdot(k\\nabla T)\\right]_i^n$, for each cell.\n7.  Perform the single explicit time step to find the new temperature field $T_i^{n+1}$.\n8.

            "problem": "Consider a lumped, one-dimensional electromagnetic–thermal coupling model where an electrically conductive medium with temperature-dependent conductivity is driven by a spatially uniform, time-independent electric field. The aim is to design and analyze a multi-rate, operator-splitting algorithm in which the electromagnetic subsystem is advanced with a smaller time step than the thermal subsystem, and to quantify the effect of the thermal nonlinearity on the splitting error.\n\nAssume the following coupled system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the electric current density and temperature:\n1. Electromagnetic subsystem (Drude-type conduction relaxation):\n$$\\tau \\dfrac{dJ}{dt} + J = \\sigma\\!\\left(T\\right)E_{0},$$\nwhere $J$ is the current density, $E_{0}$ is a constant applied electric field, $\\tau$ is a positive relaxation time, and $\\sigma\\!\\left(T\\right)$ is the electrical conductivity as a function of temperature.\n\n2. Thermal energy balance (lumped capacity with linear cooling to an ambient temperature $T_{0}$):\n$$C \\dfrac{dT}{dt} = J E_{0} - H \\left(T - T_{0}\\right),$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $C$ is the volumetric heat capacity, and $H$ is a positive heat loss coefficient.\n\nAssume a linear temperature dependence of conductivity about $T_{0}$:\n$$\\sigma\\!\\left(T\\right) = \\sigma_{0} + g \\left(T - T_{0}\\right),$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{0} > 0$ is the reference conductivity at $T_{0}$ and $g = \\left.\\dfrac{d\\sigma}{dT}\\right|_{T_{0}}$ is the thermal nonlinearity parameter.\n\nInitial conditions are\n$$J(0) = 0,\\quad T(0) = T_{0}.$$\n\nFundamental base: Use conservation of charge and the Drude current relaxation model for the electromagnetic subsystem, Joule heating $p = J E_{0}$ for electromagnetic-to-thermal coupling, and lumped energy balance for the thermal subsystem. No other constitutive shortcuts are permitted beyond these definitions.\n\nAlgorithmic task:\n- Implement a monolithic high-accuracy reference integrator for the coupled system using the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method with a sufficiently small, uniform time step $h_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n- Implement a first-order Lie operator-splitting, multi-rate algorithm in which:\n  - The thermal state $T$ is frozen within each thermal macro-step of size $\\Delta t_{T}$.\n  - The electromagnetic subsystem is subcycled with a uniform micro-step $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{EM}}$ such that an integer number $m = \\Delta t_{T}/\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{EM}}$ of electromagnetic steps fit into one thermal step.\n  - Within each macro-step, the electromagnetic subsystem is advanced from $t^{n}$ to $t^{n+1} = t^{n} + \\Delta t_{T}$ using $m$ explicit Euler micro-steps for $J$ with $T$ held fixed at $T^{n}$.\n  - The temperature is then advanced by one explicit Euler step using the macro-step-averaged Joule heating, defined as the arithmetic mean of $J E_{0}$ over the $m$ micro-steps.\n\nNumerical parameters, units, and horizon:\n- Use $E_{0} = 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$, $\\tau = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $\\sigma_{0} = 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{S/m}$, $C = 3 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J/(m^{3}\\,K)}$, $H = 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{W/(m^{3}\\,K)}$, and $T_{0} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Use a total simulation time $T_{\\mathrm{end}} = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Use $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{EM}} = 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $\\Delta t_{T} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $h_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Ensure that $m = \\Delta t_{T}/\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{EM}}$ is an integer and that $\\Delta t_{T}/h_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is also an integer so that macro-step endpoints align with the reference time grid exactly.\n\nTest suite:\nEvaluate the algorithm for the following values of the thermal nonlinearity parameter $g = \\left.\\dfrac{d\\sigma}{dT}\\right|_{T_{0}}$ (in $\\mathrm{S/(m\\,K)}$):\n- Case A (happy path): $g = 10$.\n- Case B (stronger nonlinearity): $g = 50$.\n- Case C (no thermal nonlinearity; boundary case): $g = 0$.\n- Case D (negative slope; edge case): $g = -10$.\n\nError metric and units:\n- At each thermal macro-step endpoint $t^{n}$, compute the difference between the splitting solution $T_{\\mathrm{split}}\\!\\left(t^{n}\\right)$ and the reference solution $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\!\\left(t^{n}\\right)$.\n- Report the root-mean-square error over all macro-step endpoints:\n$$\\varepsilon_{T} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\left(T_{\\mathrm{split}}\\!\\left(t^{n}\\right) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\!\\left(t^{n}\\right)\\right)^{2}},$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of thermal macro-steps. Express $\\varepsilon_{T}$ in kelvin.\n\nFinal output specification:\n- Your program must compute $\\varepsilon_{T}$ for each of the four specified values of $g$.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the four errors as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets in the order of the cases $[A,B,C,D]$, with each value printed in scientific notation with six significant figures, in kelvin. For example, the format must be exactly like\n$[\\text{float}_A,\\text{float}_B,\\text{float}_C,\\text{float}_D]$,\nwith no additional text.\n\nScientific realism and scope:\n- The model, parameters, and algorithms must be physically plausible and numerically stable for the specified settings.\n- Do not use or assume any closed-form expression for the splitting error; all error values must be obtained by numerical computation as described.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded initial value problem in computational physics. It defines a clear, non-trivial task: to implement and compare a monolithic high-order integrator against a multi-rate operator-splitting scheme for a coupled electromagnetic-thermal system, and to quantify the splitting error as a function of the system's nonlinearity. All parameters, initial conditions, and numerical procedures are explicitly and consistently defined.\n\nThe physical system is described by a coupled pair of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The first governs the evolution of the electric current density, $J$, and is based on a Drude-like relaxation model. The second describes the evolution of the temperature, $T$, based on a lumped-capacity thermal model that includes Joule heating and linear cooling.\n\nThe system of ODEs is given by:\n$$ \\tau \\,\\frac{dJ}{dt} + J = \\sigma(T)\\,E_{0} $$\n$$ C \\,\\frac{dT}{dt} = J\\,E_{0} - H \\,(T - T_{0}) $$\nThese can be rewritten in standard state-space form, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(t, \\mathbf{y})$, with the state vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [J(t), T(t)]^T$:\n$$ \\frac{dJ}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\left( \\sigma(T) E_0 - J \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C} \\left( J E_0 - H (T - T_0) \\right) $$\nThe electrical conductivity, $\\sigma$, is a linear function of temperature:\n$$ \\sigma(T) = \\sigma_0 + g (T - T_0) $$\nThe system is subject to the initial conditions $J(0) = 0$ and $T(0) = T_0$. The parameter $g$ introduces a two-way coupling between the electromagnetic and thermal subsystems. If $g=0$, the coupling is one-way: $J$ influences $T$ via Joule heating, but $T$ does not influence $J$.\n\nA high-accuracy reference solution is computed using the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. This monolithic scheme advances both state variables, $J$ and $T$, simultaneously with a small time step $h_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. For a state vector $\\mathbf{y}_n$ at time $t_n$, the state at $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$ is found by:\n$$ \\mathbf{y}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}_n + \\frac{h}{6}(\\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\\mathbf{k}_3 + \\mathbf{k}_4) $$\nwhere the stages $\\mathbf{k}_i$ are evaluations of the right-hand side function $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{y})$:\n$$ \\mathbf{k}_1 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n, \\mathbf{y}_n) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{k}_2 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + h/2, \\mathbf{y}_n + h/2 \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_1) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{k}_3 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + h/2, \\mathbf{y}_n + h/2 \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_2) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{k}_4 = \\mathbf{f}(t_n + h, \\mathbf{y}_n + h \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_3) $$\nThis method is applied with a very small step size $h = h_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ to generate a solution, $(J_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t), T_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t))$, that is considered the ground truth for error analysis.\n\nThe multi-rate algorithm employs a first-order Lie operator splitting scheme. The full system evolution operator is split into an electromagnetic part and a thermal part. The simulation proceeds in macro-steps of duration $\\Delta t_T$. Within each macro-step from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1} = t^n + \\Delta t_T$, the following sequence is executed:\n\n1.  **Electromagnetic Sub-problem**: The thermal state is frozen at its value from the beginning of the macro-step, $T(t) \\approx T^n$. The electromagnetic ODE, now a linear equation with a constant source term, is solved over the interval $[t^n, t^{n+1}]$:\n    $$ \\frac{dJ}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\left( (\\sigma_0 + g(T^n - T_0)) E_0 - J \\right) $$\n    This is advanced using $m = \\Delta t_T / \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{EM}}$ micro-steps of size $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{EM}}$ with the first-order explicit Euler method. Starting with $j_0 = J^n$, the update for each micro-step is:\n    $$ j_{k+1} = j_k + \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{EM}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\left( \\sigma(T^n) E_0 - j_k \\right) \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, \\dots, m-1 $$\n    The final current density for the macro-step is $J^{n+1} = j_m$.\n\n2.  **Coupling and Thermal Sub-problem**: The Joule heating term, $J E_0$, for the thermal update is calculated by averaging over the $m$ intermediate current density values computed in the micro-steps:\n    $$ \\langle p \\rangle^n = \\langle J E_0 \\rangle = \\frac{E_0}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} j_k $$\n    The temperature is then advanced by a single explicit Euler step of size $\\Delta t_T$, using this averaged heating term:\n    $$ T^{n+1} = T^n + \\frac{\\Delta t_T}{C} \\left( \\langle p \\rangle^n - H (T^n - T_0) \\right) $$\n\nThis splitting scheme introduces an error, primarily because freezing the temperature $T^n$ during the electromagnetic sub-cycling ignores the change in conductivity that would occur in the true coupled system. The magnitude of this error is expected to correlate with the nonlinearity parameter $g$.\n\nTo quantify this splitting error, the temperature solution from the splitting algorithm, $T_{\\mathrm{split}}(t^n) = T^n$, is compared to the reference solution, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}(t^n)$, at each macro-step endpoint $t^n$ for $n=1, \\dots, N$, where $N=T_{\\mathrm{end}}/\\Delta t_T$ is the total number of macro-steps. The root-mean-square (RMS) error is computed as:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\left(T_{\\mathrm{split}}\\!\\left(t^{n}\\right) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\!\\left(t^{n}\\right)\\right)^{2}} $$\nThis metric provides a single value representing the average deviation of the splitting solution from the reference solution over the simulation horizon. The computation is repeated for four different values of $g$ to assess the impact of thermal nonlinearity on the algorithm's accuracy.",
