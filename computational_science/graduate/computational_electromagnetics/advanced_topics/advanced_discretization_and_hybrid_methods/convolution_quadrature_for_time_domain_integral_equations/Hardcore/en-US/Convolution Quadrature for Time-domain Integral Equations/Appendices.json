            "problem": "A Time-Domain Integral Equation (TDIE) for electromagnetic scattering can be written as a causal Volterra convolution in time where the field unknown is convolved with a kernel whose Laplace transform is a transfer function. A well-tested approach for stable long-time discretization of such convolutions is Convolution Quadrature (CQ), generated by an underlying one-step method through a corresponding discrete symbol. For the trapezoidal rule (also known as the implicit midpoint method), the discrete symbol is given by the rational function $\\delta(\\zeta)=2(1-\\zeta)/(1+\\zeta)$. Consider a scalar TDIE convolution with transfer function $Z(s)=1/\\sqrt{s}$. Using CQ with time step $\\Delta t=1$, the CQ weights $\\{\\omega_{n}\\}_{n\\geq 0}$ are defined implicitly by the generating function $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\omega_{n}\\zeta^{n}=Z\\!\\left(\\delta(\\zeta)/\\Delta t\\right)$, which encodes the causal discrete convolution $u_{n}=\\sum_{j=0}^{n}\\omega_{j} f_{n-j}$ for time samples $\\{f_{n}\\}$ of the causal input.\n\nStarting from the foundational definition of convolution and its Laplace transform, and using the CQ generating-function characterization, derive exact closed-form expressions for the first three CQ weights $\\omega_{0}$, $\\omega_{1}$, and $\\omega_{2}$ for the above choice of $\\delta(\\zeta)$, $Z(s)$, and $\\Delta t$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions. The concepts of Time-Domain Integral Equations (TDIE), Convolution Quadrature (CQ), generating functions, and transfer functions are standard in computational electromagnetics and numerical analysis. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in analyzing the coefficients of the power series expansion of the generating function $G(\\zeta) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\omega_{n}\\zeta^{n}$. This function is defined as $G(\\zeta) = Z(\\delta(\\zeta)/\\Delta t)$.\n\nFirst, we construct the specific generating function for this problem. We are given:\n- The transfer function: $Z(s) = 1/\\sqrt{s} = s^{-1/2}$.\n- The discrete symbol for the trapezoidal rule: $\\delta(\\zeta) = 2(1-\\zeta)/(1+\\zeta)$.\n- The time step: $\\Delta t = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition, we obtain the generating function $G(\\zeta)$:\n$$\nG(\\zeta) = Z\\left(\\frac{\\delta(\\zeta)}{\\Delta t}\\right) = Z(\\delta(\\zeta)) = \\left( \\frac{2(1-\\zeta)}{1+\\zeta} \\right)^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\zeta}{2(1-\\zeta)}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nG(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1+\\zeta)^{1/2} (1-\\zeta)^{-1/2}\n$$\nThe CQ weights $\\{\\omega_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ are the coefficients of the Maclaurin series of $G(\\zeta)$:\n$$\nG(\\zeta) = \\omega_0 + \\omega_1 \\zeta + \\omega_2 \\zeta^2 + \\dots\n$$\n\nTo find the first three weights $\\omega_0$, $\\omega_1$, and $\\omega_2$, we expand $G(\\zeta)$ in a power series around $\\zeta=0$. We use the generalized binomial theorem, $(1+x)^{\\alpha} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{\\alpha}{k} x^k$.\n\nThe expansion for $(1+\\zeta)^{1/2}$ is:\n$$\n(1+\\zeta)^{1/2} = \\binom{1/2}{0} + \\binom{1/2}{1}\\zeta + \\binom{1/2}{2}\\zeta^2 + O(\\zeta^3) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2}-1)}{2!}\\zeta^2 + O(\\zeta^3) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta - \\frac{1}{8}\\zeta^2 + O(\\zeta^3)\n$$\nThe expansion for $(1-\\zeta)^{-1/2}$ is:\n$$\n(1-\\zeta)^{-1/2} = \\binom{-1/2}{0} + \\binom{-1/2}{1}(-\\zeta) + \\binom{-1/2}{2}(-\\zeta)^2 + O(\\zeta^3)\n$$\nThe coefficients are:\n$\\binom{-1/2}{0} = 1$\n$\\binom{-1/2}{1} = -1/2$\n$\\binom{-1/2}{2} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(-\\frac{1}{2}-1)}{2!} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(-\\frac{3}{2})}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}$\nSo the expansion is:\n$$\n(1-\\zeta)^{-1/2} = 1 + (-\\frac{1}{2})(-\\zeta) + (\\frac{3}{8})(-\\zeta)^2 + O(\\zeta^3) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta + \\frac{3}{8}\\zeta^2 + O(\\zeta^3)\n$$\nNow we multiply these two series and the pre-factor $1/\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$\nG(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta - \\frac{1}{8}\\zeta^2 + \\dots \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta + \\frac{3}{8}\\zeta^2 + \\dots \\right)\n$$\nWe collect terms by powers of $\\zeta$:\n- Constant term ($\\zeta^0$): $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1 \\cdot 1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n- $\\zeta^1$ term: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta + \\frac{1}{2}\\zeta \\cdot 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1 \\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\zeta$\n- $\\zeta^2$ term: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{3}{8}\\zeta^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta) (\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta) + (-\\frac{1}{8}\\zeta^2) \\cdot 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} \\right)\\zeta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{3+2-1}{8} \\right)\\zeta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\frac{4}{8}\\zeta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta^2$\n\nThus, the expansion of $G(\\zeta)$ is:\n$$\nG(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\zeta + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\zeta^2 + O(\\zeta^3)\n$$\nBy comparing this with $G(\\zeta) = \\omega_0 + \\omega_1\\zeta + \\omega_2\\zeta^2 + \\dots$, we identify the first three weights:\n$$\n\\omega_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the asymptotic decay rate of $\\omega_n$ for large $n$. According to principles of analytic combinatorics, the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients $[\\zeta^n]G(\\zeta)$ is determined by the dominant singularities of the function $G(\\zeta)$, i.e., the singularities with the smallest modulus. The function $G(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1+\\zeta)^{1/2}(1-\\zeta)^{-1/2}$ has branch point singularities at $\\zeta=1$ and $\\zeta=-1$. Both have modulus $1$, so they are both dominant.\n\nNear $\\zeta=1$, we can write $G(\\zeta) = f(\\zeta)(1-\\zeta)^{-1/2}$ where $f(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1+\\zeta)^{1/2}$. As $\\zeta \\to 1$, the behavior is dominated by the singularity:\n$$\nG(\\zeta) \\sim f(1) (1-\\zeta)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1+1)^{1/2} (1-\\zeta)^{-1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}(1-\\zeta)^{-1/2} = (1-\\zeta)^{-1/2}\n$$\nThe transfer theorem for singularity analysis states that if a function has an isolated singularity at $\\zeta=\\rho$ of the form $C(1-\\zeta/\\rho)^{-\\alpha}$, then its $n$-th coefficient is asymptotic to $C \\frac{n^{\\alpha-1}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\rho^{-n}$. Here, $C=1$, $\\rho=1$, and $\\alpha=1/2$. The contribution from the singularity at $\\zeta=1$ to $\\omega_n$ is:\n$$\n\\omega_n^{(+1)} \\sim \\frac{n^{1/2-1}}{\\Gamma(1/2)} (1)^{-n} = \\frac{n^{-1/2}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\n\nNear $\\zeta=-1$, the term $(1+\\zeta)^{1/2}$ becomes singular. We analyze the behavior of $G(\\zeta)$ as $\\zeta \\to -1$:\n$$\nG(\\zeta) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1+\\zeta)^{1/2}(1-(-1))^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1+\\zeta)^{1/2}(2)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\zeta)^{1/2}\n$$\nThis singularity is of the form $K(1-\\zeta/\\rho)^{\\beta}$ with $K=1/2$, $\\rho=-1$, and $\\beta=1/2$. The coefficients from such a term decay faster. Its contribution to $\\omega_n$ is of order $n^{-\\beta-1}=n^{-3/2}$. Specifically, this contribution is asymptotic to $-(-1)^n \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} n^{-3/2}$.\n\nThe total asymptotic behavior is the sum of contributions from all dominant singularities. Since $n^{-1/2}$ decays slower than $n^{-3/2}$, the leading-order behavior is determined entirely by the singularity at $\\zeta=1$. Therefore, the asymptotic decay rate is:\n$$\n\\omega_n \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi n}} = O(n^{-1/2})\n$$\n\nFinally, we discuss the relation of these findings to late-time instability suppression. Late-time instabilities in TDIE discretizations typically manifest as unphysical, exponentially growing numerical solutions that are artifacts of the numerical method. A stable scheme must correctly capture the physical behavior of the continuous system.\n\nThe continuous kernel corresponding to $Z(s)=1/\\sqrt{s}$ is the inverse Laplace transform $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{s^{-1/2}\\}(t) = (\\pi t)^{-1/2}$ for $t0$. This kernel is positive and exhibits a slow algebraic decay. This slow decay represents a \"long memory\" effect inherent to the fractional-order nature of the governing equation.\n\nThe CQ weights $\\{\\omega_n\\}$ act as the discrete version of this kernel. Our analysis reveals two crucial properties:\n1. The weights decay algebraically as $\\omega_n \\sim O(n^{-1/2})$. This correctly mimics the slow decay of the continuous kernel. A scheme that incorrectly imposes a faster (e.g., exponential) decay would fail to capture the long-memory physics and would be inaccurate at late times.\n2. The weights $\\omega_n$ are all positive for $n \\ge 0$. This can be shown by rewriting $G(\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1+\\zeta)(1-\\zeta^2)^{-1/2}$. The expansion of $(1-\\zeta^2)^{-1/2}$ contains only non-negative powers of $\\zeta^2$ with positive coefficients. Multiplying by $(1+\\zeta)$ results in a series with all positive coefficients. This positivity matches the positivity of the continuous kernel, preventing the introduction of spurious, non-physical oscillations into the numerical solution.\n\nThe CQ method based on the trapezoidal rule is known to map the imaginary axis $\\text{Re}(s)=0$ to the unit circle $|\\zeta|=1$. The singularity of $Z(s)$ at $s=0$ is thus mapped to the unit circle, not inside it, which is essential. The resulting discrete system (the convolution with weights $\\omega_n$) is not Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable, since $\\sum |\\omega_n| \\sim \\sum n^{-1/2}$ diverges. However, this is the correct behavior, as the underlying continuous operator (a fractional half-integral) is also not BIBO stable; it amplifies bounded inputs like the step function. The \"stability\" of the CQ scheme lies in its ability to reproduce the correct physical behavior of the continuous system without introducing parasitic, exponentially growing modes. The combination of positive weights and the correct algebraic decay rate ensures that the numerical solution remains physically meaningful and free from the non-physical late-time instabilities that plague other methods.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, resting on the established principles of computational electromagnetics, specifically the application of Convolution Quadrature (CQ) to time-domain boundary integral equations for wave propagation in dispersive media. All required physical constants, material properties, and numerical parameters are provided, and their values are consistent with typical scenarios in the field. The problem represents a valid and non-trivial computational task.\n\nThe central goal is to compute the discrete step response of a scalar wave operator in a Debye medium and assess its stability via an amplification metric, $A(\\tau)$, for different material relaxation times $\\tau$. The solution involves implementing the trapezoidal rule Convolution Quadrature method.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the System Transfer Function**: The physical system is modeled by a scalar transfer function $G(s)$ in the Laplace domain. This function describes a retarded potential in a homogeneous, isotropic, non-magnetic Debye medium. It is given by\n    $$G(s)=\\frac{e^{-k(s)\\,r_0}}{4\\pi\\,r_0}$$\n    where $r_0$ is a characteristic distance. The propagation constant, $k(s)$, captures the material's dispersive nature and is defined as\n    $$k(s)=s\\,\\sqrt{\\mu\\,\\epsilon(s)}$$\n    Here, $\\mu$ is the magnetic permeability, taken as the free-space value $\\mu_0$. The frequency-dependent permittivity, $\\epsilon(s)$, is described by the single-pole Debye model:\n    $$\\epsilon(s)=\\epsilon_\\infty+\\frac{\\epsilon_s-\\epsilon_\\infty}{1+s\\tau}$$\n    where $\\epsilon_\\infty$ is the high-frequency permittivity, $\\epsilon_s$ is the static permittivity, and $\\tau$ is the relaxation time. For the special case $\\tau=0$, the permittivity becomes constant, $\\epsilon(s) = \\epsilon_\\infty + (\\epsilon_s - \\epsilon_\\infty) = \\epsilon_s$, representing a non-dispersive medium. For causality, the branch of the square root for $k(s)$ must be chosen such that $\\mathrm{Re}(k(s)) \\ge 0$ when $\\mathrm{Re}(s) \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  **Discretize using Convolution Quadrature (CQ)**: The continuous time-domain convolution $y(t) = (g*u)(t)$, where $\\mathcal{L}\\{g\\}(s) = G(s)$, is approximated by a discrete convolution $y_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} w_j u_{n-j}$. The CQ weights, $w_n$, are derived from the transfer function $G(s)$ using the generating function of a numerical time-integration scheme. For the A-stable trapezoidal rule, the generating function is\n    $$\\delta(\\zeta)=\\frac{2(1-\\zeta)}{1+\\zeta}$$\n    The Laplace variable $s$ is then related to the discrete variable $\\zeta$ on a circle in the complex plane via the mapping $s = \\delta(\\zeta)/\\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is the time step.\n\n3.  **Compute CQ Weights via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: The CQ weights $w_n$ are formally given by a Cauchy integral, which is numerically approximated using the trapezoidal rule on a circular contour $|\\zeta|=\\rho  1$. This approximation is equivalent to an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT). The formula for the weights is\n    $$w_n\\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{N-1}G\\!\\left(\\frac{\\delta(\\zeta_\\ell)}{\\Delta t}\\right)\\,\\zeta_\\ell^{-n}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\zeta_\\ell=\\rho\\,e^{2\\pi i \\ell/N}$$\n    where $N$ is the number of quadrature points.

The formula can be rewritten as:\n    $$w_n \\approx \\frac{\\rho^{-n}}{N} \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{N-1} W_\\ell e^{-2\\pi i n \\ell / N}$$\n    The summation term is precisely the $n$-th component of the $N$-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the sequence $\\{W_\\ell\\}_{\\ell=0}^{N-1}$. Thus, the weights can be efficiently computed using an FFT algorithm:\n    $$w_n \\approx \\frac{\\rho^{-n}}{N} \\left(\\mathrm{FFT}\\left(\\{W_\\ell\\}\\right)\\right)_n$$\n    We only need to compute these weights for $n=0, 1, \\dots, N_t-1$. Since the underlying time-domain impulse response $g(t)$ is real, the constructed sequence $W_\\ell$ will exhibit conjugate symmetry ($W_\\ell = W_{N-\\ell}^*$), ensuring that the computed weights $w_n$ are real.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Discrete Step Response**: The problem specifies a unit-step input, $u_n = 1$ for all $n \\ge 0$. The resulting output sequence, $y_n$, is the discrete step response:\n    $$y_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} w_j u_{n-j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} w_j (1) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} w_j$$\n    This is simply the cumulative sum of the CQ weights.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stability Indicator**: For each value of $\\tau$ in the test suite, we compute the output sequence $y_n$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, N_t-1$. The stability is then quantified by the amplification factor $A(\\tau)$, defined as the maximum absolute value of the output sequence over this time interval:\n    $$A(\\tau)=\\max_{0\\le nN_t}\\,|y_n|$$\n    This value is computed for each of the four specified cases of $\\tau$.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\nFor each given $\\tau$:\na. Define all physical constants ($\\mu_0, \\epsilon_0, \\epsilon_s, \\epsilon_\\infty, r_0$) and numerical parameters ($\\Delta t, N_t, \\rho, N$).\nb. Generate the $N$ quadrature points on the CQ contour: $\\zeta_\\ell = \\rho \\exp(2\\pi i \\ell / N)$ for $\\ell = 0, \\dots, N-1$.\nc. Map these points to the Laplace domain: $s_\\ell = (2/\\Delta t)(1-\\zeta_\\ell)/(1+\\zeta_\\ell)$.\nd. For each $s_\\ell$, evaluate the transfer function $W_\\ell = G(s_\\ell)$ by first computing $\\epsilon(s_\\ell)$, then $k(s_\\ell)$, and finally $G(s_\\ell)$.\ne. Compute the FFT of the sequence $\\{W_\\ell\\}$ to obtain $\\{V_n\\} = \\mathrm{FFT}(\\{W_\\ell\\})$.\nf. Calculate the first $N_t$ CQ weights using $w_n = \\mathrm{Re}(V_n / (N \\rho^n))$ for $n=0, \\dots, N_t-1$.\ng.

The weak continuity equation states that, when tested with piecewise constant (pulse) functions over each mesh cell, the surface divergence of the current equals the negative time derivative of the surface charge, namely\n$$\n\\int_{T_i} \\nabla_s \\cdot J(\\mathbf{r},t) \\, dS \\;=\\; - \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{T_i} \\rho(\\mathbf{r},t) \\, dS,\n$$\nfor each triangle $T_i$ in the mesh.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a numerical validation of the charge conservation property in the context of Convolution Quadrature Time-Domain Integral Equations (CQ-TDIE) for computational electromagnetics. Specifically, we will compare the satisfaction of the discrete continuity equation when using a divergence-conforming discrete operator versus a non-conforming one.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in the following steps for each given parameter set $(\\Delta t, \\omega, N, A, \\varepsilon)$.\n\nFirst, we discretize the time axis as $t_n = n \\Delta t$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. Using this, we compute the prescribed charges on the two triangular cells, $T_1$ and $T_2$, at each time step. The charges are given by:\n$$\n\\rho_1^n = A \\sin(\\omega t_n)\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_2^n = -A \\sin(\\omega t_n) = -\\rho_1^n\n$$\nThese values are calculated for all time steps $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The resulting charge vectors for the two cells are $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}^n = [\\rho_1^n, \\rho_2^n]^T$.\n\nSecond, we compute the time derivative of the charges at each cell using the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) as specified by the convolution quadrature framework. The discrete time derivative of charge $\\rho_i$ at time $t_n$ is denoted $\\dot\\rho_i^n$ and is calculated for $n \\ge 2$ as:\n$$\n\\dot\\rho_i^n = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\rho_i^n - 2 \\rho_i^{n-1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_i^{n-2}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\rho_2^k = -\\rho_1^k$ for any time index $k$, it follows directly from the linearity of the BDF2 operator that the time derivatives are also equal and opposite:\n$$\n\\dot\\rho_2^n = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(-\\rho_1^n) - 2(-\\rho_1^{n-1}) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\rho_1^{n-2})\\right) = -\\dot\\rho_1^n\n$$\nWe form the vector of charge time derivatives for each time step $n \\ge 2$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}^n = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ \\dot\\rho_2^n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ -\\dot\\rho_1^n \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThird, the discrete current coefficient $J^n$ on the shared edge is determined by enforcing the discrete continuity equation on the first cell, $T_1$. The discrete continuity equation for cell $i$ is $(D J)^n_i + \\dot{\\rho}_i^n = 0$. For cell $1$ with a conforming operator, this is $(D_{\\mathrm{conf}}J^n)_1 + \\dot{\\rho}_1^n = 0$. Given $(D_{\\mathrm{conf}})_1 = 1$, this simplifies to $J^n + \\dot{\\rho}_1^n = 0$. The problem defines the current based on this principle, generalized as:\n$$\nJ^n = -\\dot\\rho_1^n\n$$\nThis calculation is performed for each time step $n=2, 3, \\dots, N-1$.\n\nFourth, we calculate the residuals of the discrete continuity equation for both the divergence-conforming and non-conforming cases. The residual vector at time $t_n$ is defined as $r^n = D J^n + \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}^n$.\n\nFor the divergence-conforming case, the discrete divergence operator is $D_{\\mathrm{conf}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The residual is:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{conf}}^n = D_{\\mathrm{conf}} J^n + \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}^n = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} J^n + \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ \\dot\\rho_2^n \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting $J^n = -\\dot\\rho_1^n$ and $\\dot\\rho_2^n = -\\dot\\rho_1^n$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{conf}}^n = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} (-\\dot\\rho_1^n) + \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ -\\dot\\rho_1^n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ \\dot\\rho_1^n \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ -\\dot\\rho_1^n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThus, for the conforming operator, the residual is the zero vector at every time step. The Euclidean norm $\\|r_{\\mathrm{conf}}^n\\|_2$ is therefore $0$ for all $n$, and its maximum over $n$ is $0$. Any non-zero result would be attributable solely to floating-point precision limitations.\n\nFor the non-conforming case, the discrete divergence operator is $D_{\\mathrm{non}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1+\\varepsilon \\\\ -1+\\varepsilon \\end{bmatrix}$. The residual is:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{non}}^n = D_{\\mathrm{non}} J^n + \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}^n = \\begin{bmatrix} 1+\\varepsilon \\\\ -1+\\varepsilon \\end{bmatrix} J^n + \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ \\dot\\rho_2^n \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting $J^n = -\\dot\\rho_1^n$ and $\\dot\\rho_2^n = -\\dot\\rho_1^n$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{non}}^n = \\begin{bmatrix} 1+\\varepsilon \\\\ -1+\\varepsilon \\end{bmatrix} (-\\dot\\rho_1^n) + \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ -\\dot\\rho_1^n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -(1+\\varepsilon)\\dot\\rho_1^n + \\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ -(-1+\\varepsilon)(-\\dot\\rho_1^n) - \\dot\\rho_1^n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\varepsilon\\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ (1-\\varepsilon)\\dot\\rho_1^n - \\dot\\rho_1^n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\varepsilon\\dot\\rho_1^n \\\\ -\\varepsilon\\dot\\rho_1^n \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe Euclidean norm of this residual vector is:\n$$\n\\|r_{\\mathrm{non}}^n\\|_2 = \\sqrt{(-\\varepsilon\\dot\\rho_1^n)^2 + (-\\varepsilon\\dot\\rho_1^n)^2} = \\sqrt{2(\\varepsilon\\dot\\rho_1^n)^2} = \\sqrt{2} |\\varepsilon \\dot\\rho_1^n|\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required output quantities for each test case. We need to find the maximum value of the residual norms over the relevant time steps, $n=2, 3, \\dots, N-1$.\nThe maximum conforming residual norm is:\n$$\n\\max_{n\\in[2, N-1]} \\|r_{\\mathrm{conf}}^n\\|_2 = 0\n$$\nThe maximum non-conforming residual norm is:\n$$\n\\max_{n\\in[2, N-1]} \\|r_{\\mathrm{non}}^n\\|_2 = \\max_{n\\in[2, N-1]} \\left( \\sqrt{2} |\\varepsilon \\dot\\rho_1^n| \\right) = \\sqrt{2} |\\varepsilon| \\max_{n\\in[2, N-1]} |\\dot\\rho_1^n|\n$$\nThe algorithm proceeds by first calculating the vector of discrete time derivatives $\\dot\\rho_1^n$ for $n=2, \\dots, N-1$, finding the maximum absolute value within this vector, and then scaling it by $\\sqrt{2}|\\varepsilon|$ to get the final non-conforming residual norm. For the special case where $\\omega=0$, $\\rho_1(t)$ is identically zero, which means $\\dot\\rho_1^n=0$ for all $n$, and both maximum residual norms will be zero.",
