This exercise  delves into the fundamental connection between the ROC and the physical nature of the time-domain signal being transformed.

In order to analyze the transient electromagnetic response using the complex-frequency (Laplace) domain and subsequently recover the time-domain fields, one introduces the bilateral Laplace transform $F(s)$ of $f(t)$, defined for complex $s = \\sigma + j \\omega$ by the integral over all time weighted by $\\exp(- s t)$. Starting only from this definition and the requirement of absolute convergence of the Laplace integral, derive a closed-form expression for $F(s)$ and rigorously determine the associated region of convergence in the complex $s$-plane by identifying the abscissa of convergence $\\sigma_{0}$ such that the region of convergence is $\\{\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\Re\\{s\\}  \\sigma_{0} \\;\\}$. Then, interpret this region of convergence physically in terms of bounded growth and causality for time-domain electromagnetic sources and fields, making explicit reference to how the exponential weight $\\exp(-\\sigma t)$ enforces integrability for right-sided signals and how the location of the Bromwich line relates to causality in inversion.\n\nProvide your final result as a row vector containing the transform $F(s)$ and the abscissa of convergence $\\sigma_{0}$.

The integral is understood in the sense of absolute convergence. The given time-domain function is $f(t) = \\exp(\\alpha t) u(t)$, where $u(t) = 0$ for $t  0$ and $u(t) = 1$ for $t \\geq 0$. Therefore, $f(t) = 0$ for $t  0$, and the bilateral integral reduces to a one-sided integral,\n\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(\\alpha t)\\,\\exp(- s t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\bigl(- (s - \\alpha) t\\bigr)\\,\\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\n\nLet $s - \\alpha = \\sigma - \\alpha + j \\omega$. The integral converges absolutely if and only if the real part of the exponent is strictly negative, i.e., $\\Re\\{-(s - \\alpha)\\} = -(\\sigma - \\alpha)  0$, which is equivalent to $\\sigma  \\alpha$.

In the language of regions of convergence, this is a right half-plane to the right of a vertical line at $\\sigma = \\alpha$. The abscissa of convergence is therefore $\\sigma_{0} = \\alpha$, and the region of convergence is $\\{ s \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\Re\\{s\\}  \\sigma_{0} \\}$.\n\nWe now provide a physical interpretation in the context of computational electromagnetics. The time dependence $f(t) = \\exp(\\alpha t) u(t)$ is right-sided and causal because $u(t)$ enforces $f(t) = 0$ for $t  0$. The Laplace transform introduces an exponential weight $\\exp(- \\sigma t)$ for $\\sigma = \\Re\\{s\\}$. For convergence of the transform integral, the weighted signal $\\exp(\\alpha t) \\exp(- \\sigma t) = \\exp\\bigl(-(\\sigma - \\alpha) t\\bigr)$ must be absolutely integrable on $[0,\\infty)$. This is ensured precisely when $\\sigma  \\alpha$, which imposes a bound on the allowable growth rate of the source: the Laplace-domain damping $\\exp(- \\sigma t)$ must dominate any time-domain growth $\\exp(\\alpha t)$. If $\\alpha  0$, the source is intrinsically decaying and the region of convergence includes the imaginary axis $\\sigma = 0$, reflecting bounded energy and stability; if $\\alpha  0$, a positive growth rate, the region of convergence shifts to the right, requiring larger $\\sigma$ to compensate for growth.\n\nThe analyticity of $F(s)$ on $\\Re\\{s\\}  \\alpha$ and the simple pole at $s = \\alpha$ have direct implications for inversion and causality. In the Bromwich inversion integral, one chooses a vertical contour $\\Re\\{s\\} = \\sigma_{b}$ with $\\sigma_{b}  \\alpha$, i.e., to the right of all singularities. For right-sided (causal) signals, the region of convergence is a right half-plane, consistent with choosing a Bromwich line to the right of the pole. This choice guarantees a causal inverse transform by ensuring that the integral decays at $t  0$ and converges for $t \\geq 0$. Thus, the region of convergence encodes both bounded-growth requirements under the Laplace weighting and the causality structure needed for stable time-domain reconstruction in computational electromagnetics.",

            "problem": "A long, uniform transmission line supports a Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) mode and is characterized by per-unit-length inductance $L$ and capacitance $C$. Assume the line is lossless, so per-unit-length resistance $R$ and conductance $G$ are both $0$, and the line is semi-infinite and perfectly matched at its far end to eliminate reflections. The line is driven at $z=0$ by a Thevenin source: an ideal voltage source with waveform $V_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)=V_{0}\\,u(t)$ in series with a source impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{s}}=Z_{0}$, where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function and $Z_{0}$ is the line’s characteristic impedance.

            "solution": "The behavior of voltage $V(z,t)$ and current $I(z,t)$ on a transmission line is governed by the telegrapher’s equations. For a lossless line, the per-unit-length resistance $R$ and conductance $G$ are zero. The equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V(z,t)}{\\partial z} = -L \\frac{\\partial I(z,t)}{\\partial t} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial I(z,t)}{\\partial z} = -C \\frac{\\partial V(z,t)}{\\partial t} $$\nwhere $L$ is the per-unit-length inductance and $C$ is the per-unit-length capacitance.\n\nTo solve these partial differential equations for the specified time-domain excitation, we employ the unilateral Laplace transform, defined as $\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) \\exp(-st) dt$. Let $\\tilde{V}(z,s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{V(z,t)\\}$ and $\\tilde{I}(z,s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{I(z,t)\\}$. We use the property for the transform of a time derivative, $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\frac{\\partial f(z,t)}{\\partial t}\\} = s F(z,s) - f(z,0)$. The problem specifies zero initial conditions, so $V(z,0) = 0$ and $I(z,0) = 0$. Applying the Laplace transform to the telegrapher's equations yields a pair of ordinary differential equations in the spatial variable $z$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{V}(z,s)}{dz} = -sL \\tilde{I}(z,s) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{I}(z,s)}{dz} = -sC \\tilde{V}(z,s) $$\nTo find a single equation for $\\tilde{V}(z,s)$, we differentiate the first equation with respect to $z$ and substitute the second equation into the result:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\tilde{V}(z,s)}{dz^2} = -sL \\frac{d\\tilde{I}(z,s)}{dz} = -sL \\left(-sC \\tilde{V}(z,s)\\right) = s^2LC \\tilde{V}(z,s) $$\nThis gives the Helmholtz equation, or the wave equation in the Laplace domain:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\tilde{V}(z,s)}{dz^2} - \\gamma^2(s) \\tilde{V}(z,s) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\gamma(s) = s\\sqrt{LC}$ is the propagation constant. The characteristic propagation speed is given as $v = 1/\\sqrt{LC}$, so we can write $\\gamma(s) = s/v$.\n\nThe general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ \\tilde{V}(z,s) = A(s) \\exp(-\\gamma z) + B(s) \\exp(\\gamma z) $$\nThe term $A(s) \\exp(-\\gamma z)$ represents a wave propagating in the $+z$ direction (forward wave), and $B(s) \\exp(\\gamma z)$ represents a wave propagating in the $-z$ direction (backward wave). The problem states the line is semi-infinite and perfectly matched, which means there are no reflections from the far end. Consequently, there can be no backward-propagating wave, which requires that $B(s) = 0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$ \\tilde{V}(z,s) = A(s) \\exp(-\\gamma z) = A(s) \\exp(-sz/v) $$\nThe coefficient $A(s)$ is determined by the boundary condition at the source, $z=0$. The source is a Thevenin equivalent circuit with voltage $V_{\\mathrm{s}}(t)$ and series impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{s}}=Z_{0}$. At the input terminal of the transmission line ($z=0$), Kirchhoff's voltage law gives:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{s}}(t) = I(0,t) Z_{\\mathrm{s}} + V(0,t) $$\nSubstituting $Z_{\\mathrm{s}} = Z_{0}$ and taking the Laplace transform, we get:\n$$ \\tilde{V}_{\\mathrm{s}}(s) = \\tilde{I}(0,s) Z_{0} + \\tilde{V}(0,s) $$\nTo relate $\\tilde{I}(0,s)$ to $\\tilde{V}(0,s)$, we use the concept of characteristic impedance. The characteristic impedance in the Laplace domain, $Z_{0}(s)$, is the ratio of voltage to current for a single propagating wave. For the forward wave:\n$$ \\tilde{I}(z,s) = -\\frac{1}{sL} \\frac{d\\tilde{V}(z,s)}{dz} = -\\frac{1}{sL} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left( A(s) \\exp(-\\gamma z) \\right) = \\frac{\\gamma}{sL} A(s) \\exp(-\\gamma z) = \\frac{\\gamma}{sL} \\tilde{V}(z,s) $$\nSo, $Z_{0}(s) = \\frac{\\tilde{V}(z,s)}{\\tilde{I}(z,s)} = \\frac{sL}{\\gamma} = \\frac{sL}{s\\sqrt{LC}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}$. This is the real, constant characteristic impedance $Z_{0}$. Thus, $\\tilde{I}(z,s) = \\tilde{V}(z,s) / Z_{0}$. At $z=0$, we have $\\tilde{I}(0,s) = \\tilde{V}(0,s) / Z_{0}$. Substituting this into the boundary condition equation:\n$$ \\tilde{V}_{\\mathrm{s}}(s) = \\left( \\frac{\\tilde{V}(0,s)}{Z_{0}} \\right) Z_{0} + \\tilde{V}(0,s) = 2 \\tilde{V}(0,s) $$\nThis shows a voltage divider effect. From this, we find $\\tilde{V}(0,s) = \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{V}_{\\mathrm{s}}(s)$.\nFrom our solution form, $\\tilde{V}(0,s) = A(s) \\exp(0) = A(s)$. Therefore, $A(s) = \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{V}_{\\mathrm{s}}(s)$.\n\nThe source voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{s}}(t) = V_{0} u(t)$. The Heaviside step function $u(t)$ models the instantaneous application of a DC voltage at $t=0$. It represents an ideal switch closing at $t=0$, connecting a DC source of voltage $V_{0}$ to the line. Its Laplace transform is $\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = 1/s$. Thus, the transform of the source voltage is:\n$$ \\tilde{V}_{\\mathrm{s}}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{V_{0} u(t)\\} = V_{0} \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\frac{V_{0}}{s} $$\nNow we can write the complete expression for the voltage along the line in the Laplace domain:\n$$ \\tilde{V}(z,s) = A(s) \\exp(-sz/v) = \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{V}_{\\mathrm{s}}(s) \\exp(-sz/v) = \\frac{V_{0}}{2} \\frac{\\exp(-sz/v)}{s} $$\nTo find the time-domain voltage $V(z,t)$, we must perform an inverse Laplace transform. We use the time-shifting property of the Laplace transform: $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{ \\exp(-as) F(s) \\} = f(t-a) u(t-a)$, where $f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\}$.\nIn our case, $F(s) = \\frac{V_0}{2s}$ and the time delay is $a = z/v$.\nThe inverse transform of $F(s)$ is:\n$$ f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{V_{0}}{2s}\\right\\} = \\frac{V_{0}}{2} \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\right\\} = \\frac{V_{0}}{2} u(t) $$\nApplying the time-shifting property, we obtain the final expression for the voltage on the line:\n$$ V(z,t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{V_{0}}{2} \\frac{\\exp(-sz/v)}{s} \\right\\} = \\frac{V_{0}}{2} u\\left(t - \\frac{z}{v}\\right) $$\nThis expression shows that for any point $z \\ge 0$, the voltage remains zero until time $t = z/v$, which is the time required for the wave to propagate from the source to that point. At that instant, the voltage jumps to a constant value of $V_{0}/2$, which is half the source voltage due to the matched source impedance.",
