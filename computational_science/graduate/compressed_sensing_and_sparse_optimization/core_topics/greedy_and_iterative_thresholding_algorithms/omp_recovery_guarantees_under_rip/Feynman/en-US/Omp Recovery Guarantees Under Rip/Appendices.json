I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate statements comparing a classical coherence-based sufficient condition for OMP recovery, which we will take as $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k-1}$, and a RIP-based sufficient condition, taken as $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}+1}$. The only tool we are allowed for relating them is the provided inequality $\\delta_s \\le (s-1)\\mu$, which for $s=k+1$ becomes $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k\\mu$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\nStatement A: Using $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k \\mu$, any matrix with $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k - 1}$ automatically satisfies $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\n\nLet's assume a matrix satisfies $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k - 1}$. Using the provided inequality, we can find an upper bound for $\\delta_{k+1}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{k+1} \\le k \\mu  k \\left( \\frac{1}{2k-1} \\right) = \\frac{k}{2k-1}\n$$\nThe statement claims that this implies $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$. This implication would hold if the upper bound we found is less than or equal to the target bound, i.e., if $\\frac{k}{2k-1} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$ for all $k \\ge 2$.\nLet's check this inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{k}{2k-1} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}\n$$\nSince both denominators are positive for $k \\ge 2$, we can cross-multiply:\n$$\nk(\\sqrt{k} + 1) \\le 2k - 1\n$$\n$$\nk\\sqrt{k} + k \\le 2k - 1\n$$\n$$\nk\\sqrt{k} \\le k - 1\n$$\nLet's test this for $k=2$: $2\\sqrt{2} \\le 2 - 1 \\implies 2.828...\\le 1$. This is false.\nFor any $k \\ge 1$, $k\\sqrt{k} \\ge k  k-1$, so the inequality $k\\sqrt{k} \\le k-1$ is always false.\nTherefore, knowing $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k - 1}$ is insufficient to prove $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$ using only the bridge inequality $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k\\mu$.\n\nVerdict for A: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\nStatement B: A sufficient coherence condition to ensure $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$ is $\\mu  \\frac{1}{k(\\sqrt{k} + 1)}$.\n\nWe want to find a condition on $\\mu$ that guarantees $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$. We have the tool $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k\\mu$.\nIf we enforce a condition on $\\mu$ such that the upper bound $k\\mu$ is itself less than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$, then the conclusion will follow.\nLet's require $k\\mu  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$.\nSolving for $\\mu$ (since $k  0$):\n$$\n\\mu  \\frac{1}{k(\\sqrt{k} + 1)}\n$$\nSo, if a matrix has a mutual coherence satisfying this inequality, it is guaranteed to satisfy the RIP-based condition. The statement is therefore a correct derivation of a sufficient condition.\n\nVerdict for B: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\nStatement C: The RIP-based sufficient condition can certify exact recovery of OMP in cases where the classical mutual coherence condition fails, because for $k \\ge 2$ one has $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}  \\frac{1}{2k - 1}$, so it is possible to have $\\mu \\in \\left( \\frac{1}{2k - 1}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1} \\right)$ while still having $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$.\n\nThis statement makes two related points. First, that the RIP condition is less restrictive than the coherence condition. This is generally true because the inequality $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k\\mu$ can be very loose; a matrix can have a small $\\delta_{k+1}$ even if its $\\mu$ is not particularly small.\nThe statement provides a justification. Let's analyze it piece by piece.\n1.  Is the inequality $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}  \\frac{1}{2k - 1}$ true for $k \\ge 2$?\n    This is equivalent to $2k - 1  \\sqrt{k} + 1$, or $2k - 2  \\sqrt{k}$.\n    Let's define $f(k) = 2k - 2 - \\sqrt{k}$.\n    For $k=2$, $f(2) = 4 - 2 - \\sqrt{2} = 2 - \\sqrt{2}  0$.\n    The derivative is $f'(k) = 2 - \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{k}}$. For $k \\ge 2$, $2\\sqrt{k}  2$, so $\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{k}}  \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $f'(k)  2 - \\frac{1}{2} = 1.5  0$.\n    Since $f(2)  0$ and $f(k)$ is strictly increasing for $k \\ge 2$, the inequality holds for all $k \\ge 2$.\n2.  The statement then claims it is possible for a matrix to fail the coherence test (e.g., have $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k-1}$) but pass the RIP test ($\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}+1}$). This possibility is precisely what makes the RIP condition less restrictive. The statement correctly identifies that such a scenario can exist, illustrating the core concept. The provided interval for $\\mu$ is a bit confusingly written, but the overall logical thrust is sound: it asserts a true possibility that serves as a valid reason for the main claim. The fact that such matrices exist is a cornerstone of modern compressed sensing.\n\nVerdict for C: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\nStatement D: The classical mutual coherence sufficient condition necessarily implies the RIP-based sufficient condition after using $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k \\mu$.\n\nThe classical condition is $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k-1}$. The RIP-based condition is $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}+1}$. The claim is that the first implies the second if we use the inequality $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k\\mu$.\nThis is the same logical proposition as in statement A. We start with $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k-1}$, which gives $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k\\mu  \\frac{k}{2k-1}$. For this to imply $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}+1}$, we would need $\\frac{k}{2k-1} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}+1}$, which we have already shown to be false for all relevant $k$. Thus, the implication does not hold under the specified line of reasoning.\n\nVerdict for D: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\nStatement E: Translating the RIP bound $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$ into a coherence bound via $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k \\mu$ yields $\\mu  \\frac{1}{k(\\sqrt{k} + 1)}$, which is strictly more restrictive than $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k - 1}$ for every $k \\ge 1$.\n\nThis statement has two parts.\n1.  The translation process: This is exactly what we analyzed for option B. To guarantee $\\delta_{k+1}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$ using $\\delta_{k+1} \\le k\\mu$, one must require $k\\mu  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} + 1}$, which yields the sufficient condition $\\mu  \\frac{1}{k(\\sqrt{k} + 1)}$. This part is correct.\n2.  The comparison of restrictiveness: The statement claims that the new condition is \"strictly more restrictive\" than the classical condition $\\mu  \\frac{1}{2k-1}$. A more restrictive condition requires the parameter ($\\mu$) to be smaller. So, the claim is that $\\frac{1}{k(\\sqrt{k} + 1)}  \\frac{1}{2k-1}$ for every $k \\ge 1$.\n    Let's check the inequality. Since both sides are positive for $k \\ge 1$, this is equivalent to:\n    $$\n    k(\\sqrt{k} + 1)  2k - 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    k\\sqrt{k} + k  2k - 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    k\\sqrt{k}  k - 1\n    $$\n    For $k=1$, we have $1\\sqrt{1}  1-1 \\implies 1  0$, which is true.\n    For $k  1$, let $g(k) = k\\sqrt{k} - (k-1)$. The derivative is $g'(k) = \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{k} - 1$. For $k1$, $\\sqrt{k}1$, so $g'(k)  \\frac{3}{2}-1 = \\frac{1}{2}  0$.\n    Since $g(1)  0$ and the function is strictly increasing for $k \\ge 1$, the inequality $k\\sqrt{k}  k-1$ holds for all $k \\ge 1$.\n    Thus, the translated coherence condition is indeed strictly more restrictive than the classical one.\n\nVerdict for E: **Correct**.\n\n### Summary of Correct Statements\n\nThe analysis shows that statements B, C, and E are correct.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is well-posed, scientifically grounded within the established theory of compressed sensing, and uses objective, formal language. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe goal is to find the smallest value of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) constant $\\delta_{2k}$, denoted $\\delta^{\\ast}$, for which Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) can fail in its first iteration.\n\nLet the sensing matrix be $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ whose columns, denoted $a_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, n$, are normalized, i.e., $\\|a_j\\|_2 = 1$. The matrix $A$ satisfies the RIP of order $2k$:\n$$\n(1 - \\delta_{2k}) \\|u\\|_{2}^{2} \\le \\|A u\\|_{2}^{2} \\le (1 + \\delta_{2k}) \\|u\\|_{2}^{2}\n$$\nfor any $2k$-sparse vector $u$. A direct consequence of the RIP of order $2k$ is a bound on the magnitude of the inner product between any two distinct columns $a_i$ and $a_j$. To see this, consider the $2$-sparse vector $u = e_i - e_j$, where $e_i$ and $e_j$ are canonical basis vectors. For $k \\ge 1$, $2 \\le 2k$, so this vector is also $2k$-sparse. We have $\\|u\\|_2^2 = \\|e_i\\|_2^2 + \\|-e_j\\|_2^2 = 2$. Applying the RIP, we get:\n$$\n(1 - \\delta_{2k}) (2) \\le \\|A(e_i - e_j)\\|_2^2 \\le (1 + \\delta_{2k}) (2)\n$$\nThe middle term is $\\|a_i - a_j\\|_2^2 = \\|a_i\\|_2^2 - 2\\langle a_i, a_j \\rangle + \\|a_j\\|_2^2 = 1 - 2\\langle a_i, a_j \\rangle + 1 = 2 - 2\\langle a_i, a_j \\rangle$.\nSubstituting this into the inequality gives $2(1 - \\delta_{2k}) \\le 2 - 2\\langle a_i, a_j \\rangle \\le 2(1 + \\delta_{2k})$. Dividing by $2$ yields $1 - \\delta_{2k} \\le 1 - \\langle a_i, a_j \\rangle \\le 1 + \\delta_{2k}$. This simplifies to $-\\delta_{2k} \\le -\\langle a_i, a_j \\rangle \\le \\delta_{2k}$, which is equivalent to $|\\langle a_i, a_j \\rangle| \\le \\delta_{2k}$. We will use this bound as the primary consequence of the RIP, as suggested by the problem statement.\n\nLet the unknown vector $x$ be $k$-sparse. Let its support set be $S \\subset \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ with $|S|=k$. The noiseless measurements are given by $y = Ax = \\sum_{i \\in S} x_i a_i$.\n\nThe first step of OMP consists of finding the column of $A$ that is most correlated with the measurement vector $y$. The selected index $j_1$ is:\n$$\nj_1 = \\arg\\max_{j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}} |\\langle a_j, y \\rangle|\n$$\nOMP fails in the first step if it selects an index not in the true support $S$. That is, there exists an index $\\ell \\notin S$ such that $|\\langle a_\\ell, y \\rangle| \\ge \\max_{j \\in S} |\\langle a_j, y \\rangle|$. We seek the smallest $\\delta_{2k}$ for which this is possible. To find this threshold, we construct a worst-case scenario that maximizes the off-support correlation $|\\langle a_\\ell, y \\rangle|$ while minimizing the on-support correlations $|\\langle a_j, y \\rangle|$ for $j \\in S$.\n\nLet's compute the correlations. For any $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n$$\n\\langle a_j, y \\rangle = \\left\\langle a_j, \\sum_{i \\in S} x_i a_i \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i \\in S} x_i \\langle a_j, a_i \\rangle\n$$\nIf $j \\in S$, this becomes $\\langle a_j, y \\rangle = x_j \\langle a_j, a_j \\rangle + \\sum_{i \\in S, i \\ne j} x_i \\langle a_j, a_i \\rangle = x_j + \\sum_{i \\in S, i \\ne j} x_i \\langle a_j, a_i \\rangle$, since $\\|a_j\\|_2=1$.\nIf $\\ell \\notin S$, the correlation is $\\langle a_\\ell, y \\rangle = \\sum_{i \\in S} x_i \\langle a_\\ell, a_i \\rangle$.\n\nWe now apply the adversarial conditions specified in the problem:\n1.  The $k$ non-zero entries of $x$ on the support $S$ have equal magnitude $c  0$. Let $x_i = c \\cdot s_i$ for $i \\in S$, where $s_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\n2.  An off-support column $a_\\ell$ exists such that its inner products $\\langle a_\\ell, a_i \\rangle$ with all support columns $a_i$ ($i \\in S$) have the same sign.\n3.  Inner products between distinct columns have magnitude bounded by $\\delta_{2k}$.\n\nLet's construct the worst-case scenario.\nTo maximize the off-support correlation $|\\langle a_\\ell, y \\rangle|$, we align the signs. Let's assume, without loss of generality, that $\\langle a_\\ell, a_i \\rangle  0$ for all $i \\in S$. To achieve the maximum possible value, we set $\\langle a_\\ell, a_i \\rangle = \\delta_{2k}$ for all $i \\in S$. We then choose the signs of the entries of $x$ to be $s_i = 1$ for all $i \\in S$. The off-support correlation is then:\n$$\n|\\langle a_\\ell, y \\rangle| = \\left| \\sum_{i \\in S} (c \\cdot 1) \\cdot \\delta_{2k} \\right| = c \\sum_{i \\in S} \\delta_{2k} = c \\cdot k \\cdot \\delta_{2k}\n$$\nNow, we must minimize the on-support correlation $\\max_{j \\in S} |\\langle a_j, y \\rangle|$ under these choices. For any $j \\in S$, and with $s_i = 1$ for all $i \\in S$:\n$$\n|\\langle a_j, y \\rangle| = |c \\cdot s_j + \\sum_{i \\in S, i \\ne j} c \\cdot s_i \\langle a_j, a_i \\rangle| = c \\left| 1 + \\sum_{i \\in S, i \\ne j} \\langle a_j, a_i \\rangle \\right|\n$$\nTo minimize this quantity, we want the sum $\\sum_{i \\in S, i \\ne j} \\langle a_j, a_i \\rangle$ to be as negative as possible. We choose the worst-case configuration allowed by the RIP-based bound: $\\langle a_j, a_i \\rangle = -\\delta_{2k}$ for all distinct $i, j \\in S$. This gives:\n$$\n|\\langle a_j, y \\rangle| = c \\left| 1 + \\sum_{i \\in S, i \\ne j} (-\\delta_{2k}) \\right| = c |1 - (k-1)\\delta_{2k}|\n$$\nThis value is the same for all $j \\in S$, so $\\max_{j \\in S} |\\langle a_j, y \\rangle| = c |1 - (k-1)\\delta_{2k}|$.\n\nThe condition for OMP to potentially fail is $|\\langle a_\\ell, y \\rangle| \\ge \\max_{j \\in S} |\\langle a_j, y \\rangle|$. Substituting our derived expressions:\n$$\nc \\cdot k \\cdot \\delta_{2k} \\ge c |1 - (k-1)\\delta_{2k}|\n$$\nSince $c  0$, we can divide it out:\n$$\nk \\cdot \\delta_{2k} \\ge |1 - (k-1)\\delta_{2k}|\n$$\nWe need to find the smallest $\\delta_{2k} \\in (0, 1)$ that satisfies this inequality. We consider two cases based on the sign of the term inside the absolute value. Note that for $k=1$, OMP always succeeds, so we assume $k \\ge 2$.\n\nCase 1: $1 - (k-1)\\delta_{2k} \\ge 0$. This holds if $\\delta_{2k} \\le \\frac{1}{k-1}$.\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$\nk \\cdot \\delta_{2k} \\ge 1 - (k-1)\\delta_{2k}\n$$\n$$\n(k + k - 1)\\delta_{2k} \\ge 1\n$$\n$$\n(2k-1)\\delta_{2k} \\ge 1 \\implies \\delta_{2k} \\ge \\frac{1}{2k-1}\n$$\nSo, in this case, failure is possible if $\\frac{1}{2k-1} \\le \\delta_{2k} \\le \\frac{1}{k-1}$.

            "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement. I will proceed with a detailed solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to construct a specific matrix and signal scenario to demonstrate a lower bound on the RIP constant $\\delta_{k+1}$ that is required for the successful operation of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The solution is structured in three parts.\n\n### Part 1: Relating the Gram Matrix to the RIP Constant\n\nThe Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) of a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ of order $s$ is defined by the constant $\\delta_s$, which is the smallest number satisfying\n$$ (1 - \\delta_s) \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 \\le \\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 \\le (1 + \\delta_s) \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 $$\nfor all $s$-sparse vectors $\\mathbf{x}$. Let $\\mathbf{x}$ have support on an index set $T$ with $|T| = s$. Let $\\mathbf{A}_T$ be the submatrix of $\\mathbf{A}$ formed by columns indexed by $T$, and let $\\mathbf{x}_T$ be the subvector of $\\mathbf{x}$ corresponding to these indices. Then $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{A}_T \\mathbf{x}_T$. The norm can be written as $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 = \\mathbf{x}_T^T \\mathbf{A}_T^T \\mathbf{A}_T \\mathbf{x}_T = \\mathbf{x}_T^T \\mathbf{G}_T \\mathbf{x}_T$, where $\\mathbf{G}_T = \\mathbf{A}_T^T \\mathbf{A}_T$ is the Gram matrix of the columns in $\\mathbf{A}_T$.\n\nThe RIP condition for the set $T$ is equivalent to bounding the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}_T$. By the Rayleigh-Ritz theorem, the bounds on the quadratic form are determined by the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}_T$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{G}_T) \\le \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_T^T \\mathbf{G}_T \\mathbf{x}_T}{\\|\\mathbf{x}_T\\|_2^2} \\le \\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{G}_T) $$\nSince $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2 = \\|\\mathbf{x}_T\\|_2$, the RIP inequalities are equivalent to $1 - \\delta_s \\le \\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{G}_T)$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{G}_T) \\le 1 + \\delta_s$ for all subsets $T$ of size $s$.\nThis implies $\\delta_s = \\max_{|T|=s} \\max(1 - \\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{G}_T), \\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{G}_T) - 1)$.\n\nIn this problem, we construct a specific set of $k+1$ columns, indexed by $T_0 = S \\cup \\{j^\\star\\}$, with a prescribed Gram matrix $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)$. The problem asks for the RIP constant \"for this constructed $(k+1)$-subset,\" which means we only need to consider the eigenvalues of this specific Gram matrix $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)$.\nThus, $\\delta_{k+1}$ for this subset is given by $\\delta_{k+1} = \\max(1 - \\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)), \\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)) - 1)$.\n\nThe given Gram matrix is $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho) = \\mathbf{I}_{k+1} + \\rho \\mathbf{K}$. Since the columns are stipulated to be unit-norm, the diagonal entries of their Gram matrix must be $1$. This is consistent with the definition of $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)$, as $\\mathbf{K}$ has a zero diagonal. For such a set of columns to exist in a Euclidean space, the Gram matrix $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)$ must be positive semidefinite (PSD), which means all its eigenvalues must be non-negative.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)$, we first find the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{K}$. Let the indices for $S$ be $\\{1, ..., k\\}$ and for $j^\\star$ be $k+1$. The matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ has the block structure:\n$$ \\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} -(\\mathbf{J}_k - \\mathbf{I}_k)  \\mathbf{1}_k \\\\ \\mathbf{1}_k^T  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{I}_k - \\mathbf{J}_k  \\mathbf{1}_k \\\\ \\mathbf{1}_k^T  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{J}_k$ is the $k \\times k$ all-ones matrix and $\\mathbf{1}_k$ is the all-ones vector of length $k$.\nLet $\\mathbf{v} = (\\mathbf{u}^T, \\alpha)^T$ be an eigenvector of $\\mathbf{K}$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The eigenvalue equation $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}$ yields two block equations:\n1. $(\\mathbf{I}_k - \\mathbf{J}_k)\\mathbf{u} + \\alpha \\mathbf{1}_k = \\lambda \\mathbf{u}$\n2. $\\mathbf{1}_k^T \\mathbf{u} = \\lambda \\alpha$\n\nWe consider two cases for the vector $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$:\nCase (a): $\\mathbf{u}$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{1}_k$, i.e., $\\mathbf{1}_k^T \\mathbf{u} = 0$.\nThe second equation gives $\\lambda \\alpha = 0$. The first equation becomes $(\\mathbf{I}_k - \\mathbf{J}_k)\\mathbf{u} + \\alpha \\mathbf{1}_k = \\lambda \\mathbf{u}$. Since $\\mathbf{1}_k^T \\mathbf{u} = 0$, $\\mathbf{J}_k \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{1}_k (\\mathbf{1}_k^T \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0}$. The equation simplifies to $\\mathbf{I}_k \\mathbf{u} = \\lambda \\mathbf{u}$, so $\\lambda = 1$. If $\\lambda=1$, then $\\alpha=0$. The space of vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ orthogonal to $\\mathbf{1}_k$ has dimension $k-1$. Thus, we have $k-1$ eigenvectors of the form $(\\mathbf{u}^T, 0)^T$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1$.\n\nCase (b): $\\mathbf{u}$ is in the span of $\\mathbf{1}_k$. Let $\\mathbf{u} = c \\mathbf{1}_k$ for some scalar $c$. The eigenvector is of the form $(c\\mathbf{1}_k^T, \\alpha)^T$.\nThe two equations become:\n1. $c(\\mathbf{I}_k - \\mathbf{J}_k)\\mathbf{1}_k + \\alpha \\mathbf{1}_k = \\lambda c \\mathbf{1}_k \\implies c(\\mathbf{1}_k - k\\mathbf{1}_k) + \\alpha \\mathbf{1}_k = \\lambda c \\mathbf{1}_k \\implies c(1-k) + \\alpha = \\lambda c$\n2. $\\mathbf{1}_k^T (c\\mathbf{1}_k) = \\lambda \\alpha \\implies ck = \\lambda \\alpha$\nWe have a linear system for $(c, \\alpha)$: $(1-k-\\lambda)c + \\alpha = 0$ and $ck - \\lambda \\alpha = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$$ -\\lambda(1 - k - \\lambda) - k = 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 + (k-1)\\lambda - k = 0 $$\nFactoring this quadratic equation gives $(\\lambda+k)(\\lambda-1) = 0$. The solutions are $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\lambda = -k$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{K}$ has eigenvalues:\n- $\\lambda = 1$ with multiplicity $(k-1) + 1 = k$.\n- $\\lambda = -k$ with multiplicity $1$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho) = \\mathbf{I}_{k+1} + \\rho \\mathbf{K}$ are given by $1 + \\rho \\lambda_i(\\mathbf{K})$:\n- $1 + \\rho(1) = 1+\\rho$ (multiplicity $k$)\n- $1 + \\rho(-k) = 1-k\\rho$ (multiplicity $1$)\nFor $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)$ to be PSD, all eigenvalues must be non-negative. Since $\\rho  0$, $1+\\rho$ is positive. We require $1-k\\rho \\ge 0$, which implies $\\rho \\le 1/k$.\nThe minimum and maximum eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)$ are $\\lambda_{\\min} = 1-k\\rho$ and $\\lambda_{\\max} = 1+\\rho$.\nThe RIP constant for this specific set of columns is then:\n$$ \\delta_{k+1} = \\max(1 - \\lambda_{\\min}, \\lambda_{\\max} - 1) = \\max(1 - (1-k\\rho), (1+\\rho) - 1) = \\max(k\\rho, \\rho) $$\nSince $k \\ge 1$ and $\\rho  0$, we have $k\\rho \\ge \\rho$. Therefore, $\\delta_{k+1} = k\\rho$.\n\n### Part 2: OMP Failure Condition\n\nOMP selects at its first iteration the column $\\mathbf{a}_j$ that maximizes the absolute correlation with the measurement vector $\\mathbf{y}$. The initial residual is $\\mathbf{r}_0 = \\mathbf{y}$. The selection is $j_1 = \\arg\\max_{j} |\\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_j \\rangle|$.\nThe problem states $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}$ where $\\mathbf{x}$ is $k$-sparse with support $S$ and has equal-magnitude, non-negative coefficients. Let these coefficients be $x_i = c  0$ for all $i \\in S$. Then $\\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{i \\in S} c \\mathbf{a}_i = c \\sum_{i \\in S} \\mathbf{a}_i$.\n\nOMP fails at the first step if it selects an index outside the true support $S$. In our construction, this means selecting the index $j^\\star$. This happens if $|\\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_{j^\\star} \\rangle| \\ge \\max_{t \\in S} |\\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle|$. We compute these two correlations.\n\nCorrelation with the off-support column $\\mathbf{a}_{j^\\star}$:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_{j^\\star} \\rangle = \\left\\langle c \\sum_{i \\in S} \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{a}_{j^\\star} \\right\\rangle = c \\sum_{i \\in S} \\langle \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{a}_{j^\\star} \\rangle $$\nFrom the Gram matrix $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)$, for any $i \\in S$, the inner product $\\langle \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{a}_{j^\\star} \\rangle$ is given by the off-diagonal entry $\\mathbf{G}(\\rho)_{i,j^\\star} = \\rho \\mathbf{K}_{i,j^\\star} = \\rho(1) = \\rho$. There are $k$ such terms in the sum.\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_{j^\\star} \\rangle = c \\sum_{i \\in S} \\rho = c k \\rho $$\n\nCorrelation with an on-support column $\\mathbf{a}_t$ for some $t \\in S$:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle = \\left\\langle c \\sum_{i \\in S} \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{a}_t \\right\\rangle = c \\sum_{i \\in S} \\langle \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle = c \\left( \\langle \\mathbf{a}_t, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle + \\sum_{i \\in S, i \\neq t} \\langle \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle \\right) $$\nThe columns are unit-norm, so $\\langle \\mathbf{a}_t, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle = 1$. For distinct $i, t \\in S$, the inner product is $\\langle \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle = \\mathbf{G}(\\rho)_{i,t} = \\rho \\mathbf{K}_{i,t} = \\rho(-1) = -\\rho$. There are $k-1$ such terms.\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle = c(1 + (k-1)(-\\rho)) = c(1 - (k-1)\\rho) $$\n\nThe failure condition is $|\\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_{j^\\star} \\rangle| \\ge |\\langle \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{a}_t \\rangle|$. Since $c0, \\rho0$, the correlation $ck\\rho$ is positive. For the range $\\rho \\le 1/k$ (derived in Part 1) and $k \\ge 1$, we have $(k-1)\\rho \\le (k-1)/k  1$, so $1-(k-1)\\rho  0$. Therefore, we can drop the absolute values:\n$$ ck\\rho \\ge c(1-(k-1)\\rho) \\implies k\\rho \\ge 1 - (k-1)\\rho $$\n$$ k\\rho + (k-1)\\rho \\ge 1 \\implies (2k-1)\\rho \\ge 1 \\implies \\rho \\ge \\frac{1}{2k-1} $$\nThe smallest value of $\\rho$ for which OMP is guaranteed to select the wrong column is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2k-1}$.\nWe verify this $\\rho$ is valid. For $k \\ge 1$, we have $2k-1 \\ge k \\iff k \\ge 1$, which is true. Thus, $\\frac{1}{2k-1} \\le \\frac{1}{k}$, so this value of $\\rho$ is within the range for which the Gram matrix is PSD.\n\n### Part 3: Deriving the Universal Constant\n\nWe now combine the results. For any $k \\ge 1$, we have constructed a scenario where OMP fails. This failure occurs at a threshold of $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2k-1}$. The RIP constant of the corresponding $(k+1) \\times (k+1)$ submatrix is given by the formula from Part 1, $\\delta_{k+1} = k\\rho$.\nSubstituting the value of $\\rho$ at the failure point, we get:\n$$ \\delta_{k+1} = k \\left( \\frac{1}{2k-1} \\right) = \\frac{k}{2k-1} $$\nThis expression gives the value of the RIP constant for our failure-inducing construction, for a given sparsity level $k$. The problem asks for a universal constant $c  0$ such that for this family of constructions (indexed by $k$), $\\delta_{k+1} \\ge c$. This requires finding a lower bound for the function $f(k) = \\frac{k}{2k-1}$ for all integers $k \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $f(k)$:\n$$ f(k) = \\frac{k}{2k-1} = \\frac{k}{2k} \\frac{1}{1 - 1/(2k)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{1 - 1/(2k)} $$\nAs $k$ increases, $1/(2k)$ decreases, $1-1/(2k)$ increases towards $1$, and thus $f(k)$ decreases towards $1/2$.\nThe derivative is $f'(k) = \\frac{1(2k-1) - k(2)}{(2k-1)^2} = \\frac{-1}{(2k-1)^2}  0$, confirming that $f(k)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $k \\ge 1$.\nThe maximum value is at $k=1$, $f(1)=1$. The infimum (greatest lower bound) of the sequence $\\{f(k)\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$ is its limit as $k \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f(k) = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{k}{2k-1} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2 - 1/k} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nFor any integer $k \\ge 1$, we have $\\frac{k}{2k-1}  \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe condition is that for our construction, $\\delta_{k+1} \\ge c$ for all $k \\ge 1$. This means we need to find $c$ such that $\\frac{k}{2k-1} \\ge c$ for all $k \\ge 1$. The best possible such constant (the largest one) is the infimum of the expression, which is $1/2$.\nSo, we can take $c = 1/2$.\n\nThis result demonstrates that for any $k \\ge 1$, there exists a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and a $k$-sparse signal $\\mathbf{x}$ for which OMP fails, and the associated submatrix has an RIP constant $\\delta_{k+1} = \\frac{k}{2k-1}  \\frac{1}{2}$. This implies that any guarantee for OMP of the form $\\delta_{k+1}  C$ must have $C \\le 1/2$. The constant $c$ required by the problem is this lower bound.",
