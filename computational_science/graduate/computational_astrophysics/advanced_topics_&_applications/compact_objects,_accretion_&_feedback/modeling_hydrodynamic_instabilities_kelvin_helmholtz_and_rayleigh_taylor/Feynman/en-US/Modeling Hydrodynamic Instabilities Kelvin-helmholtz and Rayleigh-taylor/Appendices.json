            "introduction": "The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) arises from shear, but its growth can be suppressed by physical dissipation, such as viscosity. This exercise  provides a foundational practice in stability analysis, guiding you to estimate the critical condition for the onset of instability by balancing the theoretical inviscid growth rate against the viscous damping rate. By deriving the minimum Reynolds number required for KHI to develop in a classic shear layer, you will build essential physical intuition about the interplay of forces that govern fluid instabilities.",

            "problem": "Consider a planar astrophysical shear layer formed between two semi-infinite, incompressible, equal-density fluids with velocity profile $U(y) = \\frac{\\Delta U}{2} \\tanh\\!\\left(\\frac{y}{a}\\right)$, where $\\Delta U$ is the velocity difference across the layer and $a$ is a characteristic shear thickness. Assume the flow is isothermal, the density is uniform, and the dynamics are governed by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with kinematic viscosity $\\nu$. A small-amplitude, two-dimensional perturbation of wavenumber $k$ evolves under the combined effects of inviscid Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) and viscous diffusion. It is a well-tested result of linear stability theory for the hyperbolic-tangent shear layer that, in the inviscid limit, the most unstable mode has $k a \\approx \\alpha$ with $\\alpha \\approx 0.44$, and corresponding inviscid growth rate $\\gamma_{\\text{inv}} \\approx C \\frac{\\Delta U}{a}$ with $C \\approx 0.19$ for equal densities. It is also a well-tested fact that viscous diffusion damps a Fourier mode with an exponential rate $\\gamma_{\\nu} \\approx \\nu k^{2}$.\n\nDefine the Reynolds number as $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\Delta U\\, a}{\\nu}$. For near-inviscid KHI growth of the fastest-growing mode, estimate the minimum $\\mathrm{Re}$ such that inviscid growth is not suppressed by viscosity.

Compute the resulting minimum Reynolds number and round your final answer to three significant figures. Express the final answer as a pure number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in fluid dynamics concerning the stability of a shear layer.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimum Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}$, required for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) to grow. The Reynolds number is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\Delta U\\, a}{\\nu}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta U$ is the velocity difference, $a$ is the characteristic shear thickness, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.\n\nThe growth of a perturbation is determined by the net growth rate, which is the sum of the inviscid growth rate, $\\gamma_{\\text{inv}}$, and the viscous damping rate, which is negative, $-\\gamma_{\\nu}$. Instability occurs when the net growth rate is positive, i.e., $\\gamma_{\\text{inv}} - \\gamma_{\\nu}  0$. The threshold for instability, which corresponds to the minimum Reynolds number for growth, is therefore defined by the condition where the inviscid growth rate is exactly balanced by the viscous damping rate:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{inv}} = \\gamma_{\\nu}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that this criterion should be applied to the fastest-growing inviscid mode.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the inviscid growth rate for the fastest-growing mode is given by:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{inv}} \\approx C \\frac{\\Delta U}{a}\n$$\nwith the constant $C \\approx 0.19$.\n\nThe viscous damping rate for a mode with wavenumber $k$ is given by:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\nu} \\approx \\nu k^{2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the fastest-growing inviscid mode has a dimensionless wavenumber $ka$ satisfying:\n$$\nka \\approx \\alpha\n$$\nwhere the constant $\\alpha \\approx 0.44$. From this relation, we can express the wavenumber $k$ of this mode as:\n$$\nk \\approx \\frac{\\alpha}{a}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ into the viscous damping rate equation yields the damping rate for the fastest-growing mode:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\nu} \\approx \\nu \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{a}\\right)^2 = \\nu \\frac{\\alpha^2}{a^2}\n$$\nNow, we apply the threshold criterion by equating the inviscid growth rate and the viscous damping rate:\n$$\nC \\frac{\\Delta U}{a} = \\nu \\frac{\\alpha^2}{a^2}\n$$\nTo find the Reynolds number, we rearrange this equation to isolate the term $\\frac{\\Delta U a}{\\nu}$. First, we can cancel a factor of $a^{-1}$ from both sides, or equivalently, multiply both sides by $a^2$:\n$$\nC (\\Delta U) a = \\nu \\alpha^2\n$$\nNext, we divide both sides by $\\nu$ and $C$ to solve for the expression corresponding to the Reynolds number:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta U a}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{C}\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\Delta U a}{\\nu}$, the minimum Reynolds number for instability is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{C}\n$$\nWe are given the approximate values for the constants $\\alpha$ and $C$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 0.44\n$$\n$$\nC \\approx 0.19\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\mathrm{Re}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} \\approx \\frac{(0.44)^2}{0.19} = \\frac{0.1936}{0.19} \\approx 1.018947...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $1.01$. The fourth digit is $8$, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} \\approx 1.02\n$$\nThis critical Reynolds number represents the threshold below which viscous forces are dominant enough to suppress the KHI entirely for the given shear layer profile.",

The idea is to define a smooth, periodic manufactured perturbation $(\\rho',u',v')$ and a background shear $U(y)$ on a periodic square domain and compute the exact source terms that make the manufactured solution an exact solution of the forced equations. Then, by applying a discrete spatial operator of nominal order $p$ to the manufactured fields and subtracting the exact source, the residual represents the spatial truncation error.

The grid is uniform, so all cells have equal volume. Consider the following three global mix metrics and compute them from the fields:\n\n- A mass-weighted scalar variance of the passive scalar mass fraction over the domain, defined using a density-weighted (Favre) average.\n- A mass-weighted mixing fraction defined as the fraction of total mass residing in cells whose passive scalar lies strictly between a prescribed tolerance $\\delta$ and $1-\\delta$.\n- The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) per unit mass, defined using a density-weighted decomposition of the velocity field.\n\nStart from the conservation of mass and the definition of a density-weighted average for compressible flow, together with the definition of a fluctuation as the departure from an appropriate mean. Use these to derive expressions that depend only on $\\rho_i$, $u_{x,i}$, $u_{y,i}$, and $Y_i$, and a user-specified $\\delta$. Clearly distinguish any domain averages, mass-weighted averages, and fluctuation fields in your derivation.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of three diagnostic metrics for compressible hydrodynamic flows from discrete cell-centered data. The metrics are the mass-weighted scalar variance, the mass-weighted mixing fraction, and the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass. The derivations will begin from the fundamental definition of a density-weighted (Favre) average for discrete data on a uniform grid.\n\nLet the computational domain be composed of $N$ cells, indexed by $i = 1, \\dots, N$. The quantities provided for each cell are density $\\rho_i$, velocity components $u_{x,i}$ and $u_{y,i}$, and a passive scalar mass fraction $Y_i$. Since the grid is uniform, each cell has the same volume $V$. The mass in cell $i$ is $m_i = \\rho_i V$.\n\nThe total mass over the domain is $M_{tot} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i V = V \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i$.\n\nA mass-weighted or Favre average of any quantity $\\phi$ is defined as the integral of $\\rho \\phi$ over the domain, divided by the total mass. For a discrete grid, this becomes:\n$$ \\widetilde{\\phi} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\phi_i m_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\phi_i \\rho_i V}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i V} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i \\phi_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} $$\nThe cell volume $V$ cancels, simplifying the expression. This definition will be used for all required averages.\n\n### Metric 1: Mass-Weighted Scalar Variance\nThe scalar variance measures the degree of inhomogeneity of the scalar field $Y$. For compressible flows, it is defined using Favre-averaged quantities. The fluctuation of the scalar in cell $i$ is the difference between the local value and the Favre-mean value: $Y_i'' = Y_i - \\widetilde{Y}$.\n\nThe Favre-mean of the scalar $Y$ is:\n$$ \\widetilde{Y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i Y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} $$\nThe mass-weighted variance, $\\sigma_Y^2$, is the Favre-average of the squared fluctuations, $(Y'')^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_Y^2 = \\widetilde{(Y'')^2} = \\widetilde{(Y - \\widetilde{Y})^2} $$\nSubstituting the definition of the Favre average:\n$$ \\sigma_Y^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i (Y_i - \\widetilde{Y})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} $$\nFor computational purposes, it is often more stable and efficient to use an alternative form derived from expanding the square: $\\widetilde{(Y - \\widetilde{Y})^2} = \\widetilde{Y^2 - 2Y\\widetilde{Y} + \\widetilde{Y}^2}$. By the linearity of the averaging operator, this is $\\widetilde{Y^2} - 2\\widetilde{Y}\\widetilde{Y} + \\widetilde{Y}^2 = \\widetilde{Y^2} - (\\widetilde{Y})^2$.\nThe final discrete expression for the mass-weighted scalar variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_Y^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i Y_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} - \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i Y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} \\right)^2 $$\nThis quantity is dimensionless as $Y_i$ is a dimensionless mass fraction.\n\n### Metric 2: Mass-Weighted Mixing Fraction\nThis metric, $M_\\delta$, quantifies the fraction of the total mass that is in a \"mixed\" state. A cell $i$ is considered mixed if its scalar mass fraction $Y_i$ lies strictly between a tolerance $\\delta$ and $1-\\delta$, i.e., $\\delta  Y_i  1 - \\delta$.\n\nThe total mass of mixed fluid, $M_{mixed}$, is the sum of masses of all cells that satisfy this condition.\n$$ M_{mixed} = \\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } \\delta  Y_i  1-\\delta} m_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\cdot I(\\delta  Y_i  1-\\delta) $$\nwhere $I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function, which is $1$ if the condition is true and $0$ otherwise. Substituting $m_i = \\rho_i V$:\n$$ M_{mixed} = V \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i \\cdot I(\\delta  Y_i  1-\\delta) $$\nThe mixing fraction is the ratio of the mixed mass to the total mass, $M_\\delta = M_{mixed} / M_{tot}$.\n$$ M_\\delta = \\frac{V \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i \\cdot I(\\delta  Y_i  1-\\delta)}{V \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i \\cdot I(\\delta  Y_i  1-\\delta)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} $$\nThis metric is a dimensionless ratio of masses.\n\n### Metric 3: Turbulent Kinetic Energy Per Unit Mass\nThe turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) per unit mass, $k$, is the kinetic energy associated with velocity fluctuations. The velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$ is decomposed into its Favre-mean part $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{u}}$ and its fluctuating part $\\mathbf{u}''$: $\\mathbf{u}_i = \\widetilde{\\mathbf{u}} + \\mathbf{u}_i''$.\n\nThe Favre-mean velocity components are:\n$$ \\widetilde{u_x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i u_{x,i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\widetilde{u_y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i u_{y,i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\rho_i} $$\nThe TKE per unit mass is defined as half the Favre-average of the squared magnitude of the velocity fluctuations:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{2}\\widetilde{|\\mathbf{u}''|^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\widetilde{(u_x''^2 + u_y''^2)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\widetilde{(u_x - \\widetilde{u_x})^2} + \\widetilde{(u_y - \\widetilde{u_y})^2} \\right) $$\nUsing the same variance identity as for the scalar, $\\widetilde{(\\phi - \\widetilde{\\phi})^2} = \\widetilde{\\phi^2} - (\\widetilde{\\phi})^2$, we can write $k$ as:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( \\widetilde{u_x^2} - (\\widetilde{u_x})^2 \\right) + \\left( \\widetilde{u_y^2} - (\\widetilde{u_y})^2 \\right) \\right] $$\nSubstituting the discrete definitions for the Favre averages gives the final expression:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sum \\rho_i u_{x,i}^2}{\\sum \\rho_i} - \\left(\\frac{\\sum \\rho_i u_{x,i}}{\\sum \\rho_i}\\right)^2 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\sum \\rho_i u_{y,i}^2}{\\sum \\rho_i} - \\left(\\frac{\\sum \\rho_i u_{y,i}}{\\sum \\rho_i}\\right)^2 \\right) \\right] $$\nThe units of $k$ are those of velocity squared, i.e., $\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}$.\n\nThese derived expressions can now be implemented to compute the required metrics for the given test cases.",
