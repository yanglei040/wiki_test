On a discrete grid, physical quantities and their gradients are approximated using finite difference methods. If the Jeans length—the scale on which gravitational instability develops—is not resolved by a sufficient number of cells, the numerical calculation of forces can become inaccurate. Specifically, the discretized pressure gradient, which provides support against collapse, can be systematically underestimated relative to the discretized gravitational force. This numerical imbalance can cause a gas parcel that is physically stable to appear gravitationally unstable in the simulation, leading to spurious collapse and fragmentation. By enforcing that the Jeans length spans at least $N_J$ cells (where $N_J \\ge 4$ is a common choice, and $N_J=8$ is more conservative), the simulation can accurately capture the interplay between pressure and gravity, thereby ensuring that any observed fragmentation is a result of physical processes, not numerical artifacts.",
