            "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of general relativity and differential geometry, specifically the $(3+1)$ decomposition of spacetime. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing all necessary definitions to proceed with the derivations. It represents a standard, albeit detailed, exercise in theoretical relativity.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Gauss Relation**\n\nLet $(\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})$ be the four-dimensional spacetime and $(\\Sigma_t, \\gamma_{ab})$ be a spacelike hypersurface. The induced metric $\\gamma_{ab}$ and the spatial projection operator $\\gamma^a{}_b$ are given by:\n$$ \\gamma_{ab} = g_{ab} + \\epsilon n_a n_b $$\n$$ \\gamma^a{}_b = \\delta^a{}_b + \\epsilon n^a n_b $$\nwhere $n^a$ is the future-directed unit normal to $\\Sigma_t$ with $n_a n^a = \\epsilon$. For signature $(-,+,+,+)$, the squared norm of a timelike vector is negative, so $\\epsilon=-1$. For signature $(+,-,-,-)$, it is positive, so $\\epsilon=+1$.\n\nLet $X, Y, Z$ be vector fields tangent to $\\Sigma_t$, i.e., they are spatial: $n_a X^a = 0$. The intrinsic covariant derivative $D$ on $\\Sigma_t$ is the projection of the 4D covariant derivative $\\nabla$:\n$$ D_X Y = \\text{proj}(\\nabla_X Y) $$\nThe component of $\\nabla_X Y$ normal to $\\Sigma_t$ is given by $\\epsilon g(\\nabla_X Y, n)n$. We have $g(\\nabla_X Y, n) = X(g(Y,n)) - g(Y, \\nabla_X n) = 0 - g(Y, \\nabla_X n)$.\nThe extrinsic curvature tensor is defined as $K_{ab} = -\\gamma_a{}^c\\gamma_b{}^d \\nabla_c n_d$. For spatial vectors $X, Y$, this is $K(X,Y) = K_{ab}X^a Y^b = -(\\gamma_a{}^c X^a)(\\gamma_b{}^d Y^b) \\nabla_c n_d = -g(\\text{proj}(\\nabla_X n), Y)$. Because $n_a$ is hypersurface-orthogonal, $\\gamma_a{}^c\\nabla_c n_b$ is symmetric, so $K_{ab}$ is symmetric. Also, $\\text{proj}(\\nabla_X n)$ is purely spatial. We can write $g(Y, \\nabla_X n) = g(Y, \\text{proj}(\\nabla_X n))$. Thus, $g(\\nabla_X Y, n) = -g(Y, \\nabla_X n) = K(X,Y)$.\nThis leads to the Gauss formula:\n$$ \\nabla_X Y = D_X Y + \\epsilon K(X,Y) n $$\nThe Weingarten equation describes the derivative of the normal vector. The spatial projection of $\\nabla_X n$ is:\n$$ (\\text{proj}(\\nabla_X n))^a = \\gamma^a{}_b (\\nabla_X n)^b = \\gamma^a{}_b X^c \\nabla_c n^b $$\nIts components are $\\gamma^a{}_b X^c \\nabla_c n_d g^{db}$. The covector form is more direct: for a spatial vector $X$, the projection of $\\nabla_X n$ is simply $-K(X, \\cdot)^\\sharp$, where the sharp operator raises the index with $\\gamma^{ab}$. In components, $\\gamma_b{}^d \\nabla_a n_d = -K_{ab}$ for spatial $a,b$.\n$$ \\text{proj}(\\nabla_X n) = -K_X^\\sharp $$\n\nThe 3-dimensional Riemann tensor ${}^{(3)}R$ on $\\Sigma_t$ is defined by its action on spatial vector fields $X, Y, Z$:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R(X,Y)Z = D_X D_Y Z - D_Y D_X Z - D_{[X,Y]} Z $$\nWe express $D$ in terms of $\\nabla$ using the Gauss formula. For a spatial vector field $Z$, $D_Y Z = \\nabla_Y Z - \\epsilon K(Y,Z)n$.\nThen we compute $D_X(D_Y Z)$:\n$$ D_X(D_Y Z) = \\text{proj}(\\nabla_X(D_Y Z)) = \\text{proj}(\\nabla_X(\\nabla_Y Z - \\epsilon K(Y,Z)n)) $$\n$$ D_X(D_Y Z) = \\text{proj}(\\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z) - \\epsilon\\,\\text{proj}(\\nabla_X(K(Y,Z)n)) $$\nThe second term expands as $\\text{proj}((\\nabla_X K(Y,Z))n + K(Y,Z)\\nabla_X n)$. Since $n$ is normal, the first part projects to zero. The second part becomes $K(Y,Z)\\text{proj}(\\nabla_X n) = -K(Y,Z)K_X^\\sharp$.\nSo, $D_X D_Y Z = \\text{proj}(\\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z) - \\epsilon K(Y,Z)K_X^\\sharp$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of ${}^{(3)}R(X,Y)Z$:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R(X,Y)Z = [\\text{proj}(\\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z) - \\epsilon K(Y,Z)K_X^\\sharp] - [X \\leftrightarrow Y] - \\text{proj}(\\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z) $$\nThe terms involving $\\nabla$ combine to give the projection of the 4D Riemann tensor:\n$$ \\text{proj}(\\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z) = \\text{proj}(R(X,Y)Z) $$\nThe remaining terms are from the extrinsic curvature:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R(X,Y)Z = \\text{proj}(R(X,Y)Z) - \\epsilon (K(Y,Z)K_X^\\sharp - K(X,Z)K_Y^\\sharp) $$\nIn component form, with all indices spatial (i.e., vectors and covectors in the tangent/cotangent space of $\\Sigma_t$), this is ${}^{(3)}R_{pqr}{}^s = (\\text{proj } R)_{pqr}{}^s - \\epsilon(K_{qr}K_p{}^s - K_{pr}K_q{}^s)$.\nLowering the final index gives the Gauss relation:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R_{pqrs} = \\gamma_p{}^a \\gamma_q{}^b \\gamma_r{}^c \\gamma_s{}^d R_{abcd} - \\epsilon (K_{pr}K_{qs} - K_{ps}K_{qr}) $$\n\n**2. Contracted Gauss Relation**\n\nTo find the 3-Ricci scalar ${}^{(3)}R$, we contract the Gauss relation with $\\gamma^{pr}\\gamma^{qs}$:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R = \\gamma^{pr}\\gamma^{qs} {}^{(3)}R_{pqrs} = \\gamma^{pr}\\gamma^{qs} (\\gamma_p{}^a \\gamma_q{}^b \\gamma_r{}^c \\gamma_s{}^d R_{abcd}) - \\epsilon \\gamma^{pr}\\gamma^{qs} (K_{pr}K_{qs} - K_{ps}K_{qr}) $$\nLet's evaluate the two terms. First, the curvature term:\n$$ (\\gamma^{pr}\\gamma_p{}^a\\gamma_r{}^c)(\\gamma^{qs}\\gamma_q{}^b\\gamma_s{}^d) R_{abcd} = (\\gamma^{ac})(\\gamma^{bd}) R_{abcd} $$\nWe use the identity $g^{ab} = \\gamma^{ab} - \\epsilon n^a n^b$, which means $\\gamma^{ab} = g^{ab} + \\epsilon n^a n^b$ (in spatial components). So we use the projector $\\gamma^a{}_b$: $\\gamma^{ac}\\gamma^{bd} = (\\delta_p^a + \\epsilon n^a n_p)g^{pc} (\\delta_q^b + \\epsilon n^b n_q)g^{qd}$. A more direct expansion is:\n$$ \\gamma^{ac}\\gamma^{bd}R_{abcd} = (g^{ac}+\\epsilon n^a n^c)(g^{bd}+\\epsilon n^b n^d)R_{abcd} $$\n$$ = g^{ac}g^{bd}R_{abcd} + \\epsilon g^{ac}n^b n^d R_{abcd} + \\epsilon n^a n^c g^{bd} R_{abcd} + \\epsilon^2 n^a n^c n^b n^d R_{abcd} $$\nThe terms are:\n- $g^{ac}g^{bd}R_{abcd}=R$, the 4D Ricci scalar.\n- $\\epsilon g^{ac}R_{abcd}n^b n^d = \\epsilon R_{bd}n^b n^d$.\n- $\\epsilon g^{bd}R_{abcd}n^a n^c = \\epsilon R_{ac}n^a n^c$.\n- The last term $\\epsilon^2 n^a n^c n^b n^d R_{abcd}$ is zero due to the antisymmetry $R_{abcd} = -R_{bacd}$.\nSo, $\\gamma^{ac}\\gamma^{bd}R_{abcd} = R + 2\\epsilon R_{ab}n^a n^b$.\n\nNext, the extrinsic curvature term:\n$$ -\\epsilon \\gamma^{pr}\\gamma^{qs} (K_{pr}K_{qs} - K_{ps}K_{qr}) = -\\epsilon [(\\gamma^{pr}K_{pr})(\\gamma^{qs}K_{qs}) - (\\gamma^{pr}K_{ps})(\\gamma^{qs}K_{qr})] $$\n$$ = -\\epsilon [K \\cdot K - K^{rs}K_{sr}] = -\\epsilon (K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) $$\nwhere $K \\equiv \\gamma^{ab}K_{ab}$ and $K_{ab}K^{ab} \\equiv K_{ab}\\gamma^{ac}\\gamma^{bd}K_{cd}$.\n\nCombining these results, we find the contracted Gauss relation:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R = R + 2\\epsilon R_{ab}n^a n^b - \\epsilon(K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) $$\n\n**3. Hamiltonian Constraint**\n\nWe want to express this relation using the Einstein tensor $G_{ab} = R_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}R g_{ab}$. Contracting with $n^a n^b$ gives:\n$$ G_{ab}n^a n^b = R_{ab}n^a n^b - \\frac{1}{2}R g_{ab}n^a n^b = R_{ab}n^a n^b - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon R $$\nThis allows us to write $R_{ab}n^a n^b = G_{ab}n^a n^b + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon R$.\nSubstitute this into the expression for ${}^{(3)}R$:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R = R + 2\\epsilon (G_{ab}n^a n^b + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon R) - \\epsilon(K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) $$\n$$ {}^{(3)}R = R + 2\\epsilon G_{ab}n^a n^b + \\epsilon^2 R - \\epsilon(K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) $$\nSince $\\epsilon^2=1$:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R = 2\\epsilon G_{ab}n^a n^b + (-\\epsilon) (K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) $$\nThis equation is typically rearranged. Let's multiply by $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon {}^{(3)}R = 2 G_{ab}n^a n^b - (K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) $$\nLet's use the standard form by bringing geometric terms to one side:\n$$ {}^{(3)}R + \\epsilon(K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) = 2\\epsilon G_{ab}n^a n^b $$\nThe term on the left, which depends only on the geometry of the hypersurface $\\Sigma_t$, is the Hamiltonian constraint scalar, $\\mathcal{H}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{H} \\equiv {}^{(3)}R + \\epsilon(K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) $$\nUsing the Einstein Field Equations $G_{ab} = 8\\pi T_{ab}$, the full constraint equation becomes:\n$$ \\mathcal{H} = 16\\pi\\epsilon T_{ab}n^a n^b $$\n\nLet's examine the two signatures:\n- For signature $(-,+,+,+)$, $\\epsilon=-1$. The Hamiltonian constraint scalar is:\n$$ \\mathcal{H} = {}^{(3)}R + (-1)(K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) = {}^{(3)}R + K_{ab}K^{ab} - K^2 $$\n- For signature $(+,-,-,-)$, $\\epsilon=+1$. The Hamiltonian constraint scalar is:\n$$ \\mathcal{H} = {}^{(3)}R + (+1)(K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab}) = {}^{(3)}R + K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab} $$\nThe relative sign between the ${}^{(3)}R$ term and the quadratic extrinsic curvature terms $(K^2 - K_{ab}K^{ab})$ is opposite for the two signatures.\n\n**4. Application to Kerr Vacuum Spacetime**\n\nThe Kerr geometry is a vacuum solution to the Einstein Field Equations. This means the stress-energy tensor is zero everywhere:\n$$ T_{ab} = 0 $$\nBy virtue of the Einstein Field Equations, $G_{ab}=8\\pi T_{ab}$, this implies that the Einstein tensor is also zero everywhere in the Kerr spacetime:\n$$ G_{ab} = 0 $$\nThe Hamiltonian constraint equation derived in Part 3 relates the Hamiltonian constraint scalar $\\mathcal{H}$ to the projection of the Einstein tensor onto the normal vector:\n$$ \\mathcal{H} = 2\\epsilon G_{ab}n^a n^b $$\nSince $G_{ab}=0$ for all components $(a,b)$, its projection $G_{ab}n^a n^b$ onto the normal $n^a$ of any spacelike hypersurface must also be zero. The choice of the $t=\\text{constant}$ hypersurface in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates (on any region where it is spacelike) is a valid setting to apply this result.\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian constraint scalar is zero:\n$$ \\mathcal{H} = 2\\epsilon (0) = 0 $$\nThis conclusion relies only on the derived geometric identities and the fact that Kerr is a vacuum solution, as required. It does not necessitate any explicit calculation of the extrinsic curvature or the 3-Ricci scalar for the slice. The result is independent of the metric signature, so it is $0$ for both $\\epsilon=-1$ and $\\epsilon=+1$.\n\nThe final answer is the value of the Hamiltonian constraint scalar for the signatures $[(-,+,+,+), (+,-,-,-)]$.",

Consider the $t=\\mathrm{const}$ hypersurfaces with vanishing shift vector and the natural normal one-form. In this static slicing, the extrinsic curvature is identically zero, so the Gauss equation reduces to the equality between the intrinsic three-dimensional Riemann tensor on the hypersurface and the fully spatial projection of the spacetime Riemann tensor.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base and core definitions only:\n- The Schwarzschild line element in standard coordinates, with mass parameter $M$, has metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ that is diagonal with components $g_{tt}=-\\left(1-\\dfrac{2M}{r}\\right)$, $g_{rr}=\\left(1-\\dfrac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$, $g_{\\theta\\theta}=r^{2}$, $g_{\\phi\\phi}=r^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta$.\n- The induced three-metric on $t=\\mathrm{const}$ slices is $\\gamma_{ij}$ given by the spatial block of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, i.e., $\\gamma_{rr}=\\left(1-\\dfrac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$, $\\gamma_{\\theta\\theta}=r^{2}$, $\\gamma_{\\phi\\phi}=r^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta$.\n- The Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection for a metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are defined by $\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma}=\\dfrac{1}{2}g^{\\alpha\\delta}\\left(\\partial_{\\beta}g_{\\gamma\\delta}+\\partial_{\\gamma}g_{\\beta\\delta}-\\partial_{\\delta}g_{\\beta\\gamma}\\right)$, and similarly for the three-metric $\\gamma_{ij}$.\n- The Riemann curvature tensor is defined by $R^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma\\delta}=\\partial_{\\gamma}\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\delta}-\\partial_{\\delta}\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma}+\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\gamma\\mu}\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\ \\beta\\delta}-\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\delta\\mu}\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma}$, and similarly in three dimensions with Latin indices.\n\nImplement the following purely mathematical and algorithmic tasks:\n1.

You must lower indices using the metric at the evaluation point.\n3. Construct the fully spatial projection of the $4$-dimensional Riemann tensor onto the $t=\\mathrm{const}$ hypersurface tangents by selecting its components with all indices in the spatial set $\\{r,\\theta,\\phi\\}$ (i.e., $\\mu,\\nu,\\rho,\\sigma \\in \\{r,\\theta,\\phi\\}$) to form an array $R^{\\mathrm{proj}}_{ijkl}$ with the index order aligned to $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$.\n4.

            "solution": "The problem requires a numerical verification of the Gauss-Codazzi equations for a specific scenario within the framework of General Relativity's $3+1$ decomposition. We are to consider a static, constant-time ($t=\\mathrm{const}$) hypersurface in the Schwarzschild spacetime. The solution involves numerically computing the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature tensors of this hypersurface and verifying that they satisfy the constraint equations.\n\n**1. Theoretical Framework: The Gauss-Codazzi Equations**\n\nThe $3+1$ formalism decomposes the four-dimensional spacetime into a stack of three-dimensional spatial hypersurfaces. The geometry of spacetime is then described in terms of the intrinsic geometry of these slices and how they are embedded in the larger spacetime. The fundamental equations relating the four-dimensional curvature to the three-dimensional geometry are the Gauss-Codazzi equations.\n\nThe Gauss equation relates the intrinsic three-dimensional Riemann tensor of the spatial slice, denoted ${}^{(3)}\\!R_{ijkl}$, to the projection of the four-dimensional spacetime Riemann tensor $R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$ and the extrinsic curvature of the slice, $K_{ij}$:\n$$\n{}^{(3)}R_{ikjl} = R^{\\perp}_{ikjl} + K_{ik}K_{jl} - K_{il}K_{jk}\n$$\nHere, $R^{\\perp}_{ikjl}$ represents the projection of the $4$-dimensional Riemann tensor onto the spatial hypersurface, given by $R^{\\perp}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} = \\gamma^i_\\alpha \\gamma^j_\\beta \\gamma^k_\\gamma \\gamma^l_\\delta R_{ijkl}$, where $\\gamma^i_\\alpha$ is the projection operator.\n\n**2. Simplification for the Schwarzschild Static Slice**\n\nThe problem specifies Schwarzschild spacetime in standard coordinates $(t,r,\\theta,\\phi)$ and examines the $t=\\mathrm{const}$ hypersurfaces. The metric is diagonal and time-independent. This slicing is static, meaning the geometry of the spatial slices does not change in time. A key property of such a slice is that its extrinsic curvature vanishes, i.e., $K_{ij}=0$. The extrinsic curvature measures how the normal vectors to the hypersurface change as one moves along the surface, and for a static slicing, they do not change.\n\nWith $K_{ij}=0$, the Gauss equation simplifies dramatically to:\n$$\n{}^{(3)}R_{ikjl} = R^{\\perp}_{ikjl}\n$$\nFurthermore, in the chosen coordinate system, the spatial coordinates $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$ are orthogonal to the time coordinate $t$. The projection of the 4D Riemann tensor simply amounts to selecting the components where all indices are spatial. If we let the Latin indices $i,j,k,l$ range over the spatial coordinates $\\{r,\\theta,\\phi\\}$, the equation to verify becomes a direct equality between the 3D Riemann tensor computed from the slice's intrinsic metric and the purely spatial components of the 4D Riemann tensor:\n$$\n{}^{(3)}R_{ijkl} = R_{ijkl}\n$$\nThis provides a clear, verifiable identity to test numerically.\n\n**3. Computational Strategy**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute both sides of the simplified Gauss equation numerically and compare them. The fundamental definitions for the geometric objects are provided, and all derivatives must be computed numerically using central finite differences.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\na. **Define the Metrics**: Implement functions that provide the components of the $4$-dimensional spacetime metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}(t,r,\\theta,\\phi)$ and the $3$-dimensional induced spatial metric $\\gamma_{ij}(r,\\theta,\\phi)$ at any given coordinate point. The components are given by the problem statement.\n\nb. **Compute Christoffel Symbols**: The Christoffel symbols, which describe the effects of parallel transport, are computed from the first derivatives of the metric. The definition for the $4$-dimensional symbols is:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\alpha\\delta}\\left(\\partial_{\\beta}g_{\\gamma\\delta} + \\partial_{\\gamma}g_{\\beta\\delta} - \\partial_{\\delta}g_{\\beta\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nAn analogous formula holds for the $3$-dimensional symbols ${}^{(3)}\\!\\Gamma^{i}_{\\ jk}$ using the spatial metric $\\gamma_{ij}$. All partial derivatives $\\partial_{\\alpha}g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are calculated numerically using the central difference formula: $f'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}$.\n\nc. **Compute Riemann Curvature Tensors**: The Riemann tensor, capturing the curvature of the manifold, is defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their first derivatives. The definition for the $4$-dimensional tensor is:\n$$\nR^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma\\delta} = \\partial_{\\gamma}\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\delta} - \\partial_{\\delta}\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma} + \\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\gamma\\mu}\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\ \\beta\\delta} - \\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\delta\\mu}\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma}\n$$\nAgain, an analogous formula holds for ${}^{(3)}\\!R^{i}_{\\ jkl}$. The derivatives of the Christoffel symbols, such as $\\partial_{\\gamma}\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta\\delta}$, are also computed using central differences. This involves evaluating the Christoffel symbols at slightly displaced points, which is a computationally intensive but direct implementation of the definition. After computing the tensor with one upper index, we lower it using the metric: $R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} = g_{\\alpha\\mu}R^{\\mu}_{\\ \\beta\\gamma\\delta}$.\n\nd. **Projection and Comparison**: Once both tensors, ${}^{(3)}\\!R_{ijkl}$ and $R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$, are computed at the specified evaluation point, we extract the purely spatial components of $R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$ to form the projected tensor $R^{\\mathrm{proj}}_{ijkl}$. In this case, this simply means taking the sub-tensor where all four indices correspond to $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$.\n\ne. **Validation Metric**: The agreement between the two computed tensors is quantified using the provided dimensionless metric $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\left\\|\\,{}^{(3)}\\!R_{ijkl}-R^{\\mathrm{proj}}_{ijkl}\\right\\|_{F}}{\\left\\|\\,{}^{(3)}\\!R_{ijkl}\\right\\|_{F}+\\left\\|R^{\\mathrm{proj}}_{ijkl}\\right\\|_{F}+\\delta}\n$$\nwhere $\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{F}$ is the Frobenius norm and $\\delta=10^{-30}$ is a regularization constant. This metric measures the relative error between the two tensors. A small value of $\\varepsilon$ indicates good agreement and serves as a successful consistency check of our numerical implementation against the known physics. The non-zero value of $\\varepsilon$ stems from the truncation error inherent in the finite difference approximations.\n\nThe implementation encapsulates these steps into a set of functions. A top-level function iterates through the test cases, calling a core calculation routine for each set of parameters. This routine orchestrates the computation of the two Riemann tensors and the final error metric $\\varepsilon$. Special care is taken in the implementation to handle function closures correctly when creating functions for numerical differentiation inside loops.",
