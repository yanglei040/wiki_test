This exercise explores the onset of the most prominent of these, the $m=2$ bar-mode instability, which is classically governed by the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy, $\\beta = T/|W|$. You will apply a physically-motivated semi-analytic model to quantify how general relativistic effects and thermal pressure support shift the instability threshold, and calculate the resulting instability growth rate, providing a direct link between the star's bulk properties and its dynamic evolution .",

            "problem": "You are tasked with building a self-contained program that, for a set of hypermassive neutron star parameter sets representative of a post-merger remnant, computes the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational binding energy, correlates this ratio with the onset of the non-axisymmetric $m=2$ bar-mode instability, and evaluates the role of thermal pressure in shifting the instability threshold.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid. It presents a self-contained, physically and mathematically consistent modeling task based on established principles in astrophysics. All necessary parameters, constants, and equations are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. The model, while simplified, uses standard and plausible approximations for studying rotational instabilities in neutron stars.\n\nThe task is to compute the growth rate of the $m=2$ bar-mode instability for several hypermassive neutron star configurations. The core of the model is the comparison between the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational binding energy, denoted $\\beta$, and a critical threshold for this ratio, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. The system is unstable if $\\beta  \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the physical constants and model parameters provided:\n- Gravitational constant: $G = 6.674\\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,kg^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}$.\n- Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458\\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n- Moment of inertia structural coefficient: $k_I = 0.35$.\n- Gravitational binding energy structural coefficient: $k_W = 0.60$.\n- Thermal expansion coefficient: $\\chi = 0.30$.\n- Instability threshold model coefficients: Newtonian baseline $\\beta_N = 0.266$, compactness correction $a_C = -0.10$, and thermal correction $a_{\\mathrm{th}} = +0.05$.\n- Growth rate scaling constant: $\\sigma = 0.60$.\n\nFor each test case, defined by the set of parameters $\\{M, R_{\\mathrm{cold}}, J, f_{\\mathrm{th}}\\}$ representing gravitational mass, cold-limit radius, total angular momentum, and thermal energy fraction, respectively, we proceed through the following sequence of calculations.\n\n1.  **Thermally Expanded Radius ($R$)**: The stellar radius is affected by thermal pressure. We model this as a linear expansion from the cold radius $R_{\\mathrm{cold}}$, proportional to the thermal fraction $f_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and a coupling coefficient $\\chi$.\n    $$R = R_{\\mathrm{cold}}\\left(1 + \\chi f_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **Moment of Inertia ($I$)**: Using the expanded radius $R$, we calculate the moment of inertia $I$ with a simple structural model, where $k_I$ is a dimensionless constant that depends on the star's internal density distribution.\n    $$I = k_I M R^2$$\n\n3.  **Gravitational Binding Energy ($|W|$)**: The magnitude of the gravitational binding energy $|W|$ is estimated using a Newtonian-like formula, corrected by a structural factor $k_W$.\n    $$|W| = k_W \\frac{G M^2}{R}$$\n\n4.  **Rotational Kinetic Energy ($T$)**: The rotational kinetic energy $T$ is expressed in terms of the total angular momentum $J$ and the moment of inertia $I$.\n    $$T = \\frac{J^2}{2 I}$$\n\n5.  **Kinetic-to-Binding-Energy Ratio ($\\beta$)**: This dimensionless ratio is the key parameter governing dynamical instabilities. It is defined as:\n    $$\\beta = \\frac{T}{|W|}$$\n\n6.  **Compactness ($C$)**: The stellar compactness $C$ is a dimensionless measure of an object's gravitational strength, defined as the ratio of its Schwarzschild radius to its physical radius. It is used to parametrize general relativistic effects.\n    $$C = \\frac{G M}{R c^2}$$\n\n7.  **Instability Threshold ($\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$)**: The critical threshold for the bar-mode instability, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is modeled as a function of both compactness $C$ and thermal fraction $f_{\\mathrm{th}}$. It represents a first-order correction to the classical Newtonian value $\\beta_N$. General relativistic effects, captured by $C$, are stabilizing ($a_C  0$), while thermal pressure, captured by $f_{\\mathrm{th}}$, is also modeled as a stabilizing influence ($a_{\\mathrm{th}}  0$).\n    $$\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}(C, f_{\\mathrm{th}}) = \\beta_N + a_C C + a_{\\mathrm{th}} f_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n\n8.  **Instability Condition**: The star is dynamically unstable to the $m=2$ bar mode if its rotational energy ratio $\\beta$ exceeds the critical threshold $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. We define a boolean variable, $\\text{is\\_unstable}$, to be true if $\\beta  \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and false otherwise.\n\n9.  **Angular Frequency ($\\Omega$)**: The angular frequency $\\Omega$ is required for calculating the instability growth rate. It is derived from the angular momentum $J$ and moment of inertia $I$.\n    $$\\Omega = \\frac{J}{I}$$\n\n10. **Instability Growth Rate ($\\gamma$)**: If the star is unstable ($\\beta  \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$), the amplitude of the bar-mode deformation grows exponentially with a rate $\\gamma$. This growth rate is modeled to be proportional to the star's rotation rate $\\Omega$ and the square root of the fractional amount by which $\\beta$ exceeds $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. If the star is stable, the growth rate is zero.\n    $$\\gamma = \\begin{cases} \\sigma\\, \\Omega\\, \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\beta}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}} - 1}  \\text{if } \\beta  \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } \\beta \\le \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\end{cases}$$\n\nBy applying these ten steps to each test case, we can determine its stability properties and compute the required output vector $[\\beta, \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}, \\text{is\\_unstable}, \\gamma]$.

The question of resolving the MRI wavelength on a numerical grid is a practical and crucial consideration in computational astrophysics.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, feasible, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a local, powerful instability in differentially rotating, magnetized fluids. We seek the wavelength of the fastest-growing axisymmetric mode. Let the axis of rotation be the $\\hat{z}$-axis. In the local shearing-sheet approximation, the background flow is $\\mathbf{v}_0 = -q\\Omega x \\hat{y}$, where $q = -d\\ln\\Omega/d\\ln R$ is the local shear rate and $R$ is the cylindrical radius. The problem specifies a background magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B \\hat{z}$ and axisymmetric perturbations with wavevector $\\mathbf{k} = k \\hat{z}$.\n\nThe dispersion relation for linear, axisymmetric modes in this system is given by:\n$$ (\\sigma^2 + k^2 v_A^2)(\\sigma^2 + \\kappa^2) = 2q\\Omega^2 k^2 v_A^2 $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the growth rate of the mode, $v_A = B/\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho}$ is the Alfvén speed, and $\\kappa$ is the epicyclic frequency. The epicyclic frequency is given by $\\kappa^2 = 2(2-q)\\Omega^2$.\n\nThe problem describes an HMNS with \"strong differential rotation\". A common and representative model for such a system is a rotation profile where specific angular momentum is constant, $j = \\Omega R^2 = \\mathrm{const}$. This implies $\\Omega \\propto R^{-2}$, so the shear rate is $q = -d\\ln(R^{-2})/d\\ln R = 2$. For $q=2$, the epicyclic frequency vanishes: $\\kappa^2 = 2(2-2)\\Omega^2=0$. This significantly simplifies the dispersion relation. For $\\kappa^2=0$, a standard form of the dispersion relation is $(\\sigma^2+k^2v_A^2)^2 = 4\\Omega^2k^2v_A^2$. Taking the square root:\n$\\sigma^2+k^2v_A^2 = \\pm 2\\Omega k v_A$. For instability ($\\sigma^2  0$), we take the positive root.\n$$ \\sigma^2 = 2\\Omega k v_A - k^2 v_A^2 $$\nTo find the fastest-growing mode, we maximize $\\sigma^2$ with respect to the wavenumber $k$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\sigma^2)}{dk} = 2\\Omega v_A - 2k v_A^2 = 0 $$\nSolving for $k$ gives the wavenumber of the fastest-growing mode, $k_{\\mathrm{MRI}}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{MRI}} = \\frac{2\\Omega v_A}{2v_A^2} = \\frac{\\Omega}{v_A} $$\nThe corresponding wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{MRI}}$, is:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{MRI}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{k_{\\mathrm{MRI}}} = \\frac{2\\pi v_A}{\\Omega} $$\nThis expression captures the leading-order dependence.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe squared signal-to-noise ratio, $\\rho^2$, for a signal with Fourier transform $\\tilde{h}(f)$ in stationary Gaussian noise characterized by a one-sided power spectral density $S_{n}(f)$ is given by the foundational formula of matched filtering:\n$$ \\rho^2 = 4 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{|\\tilde{h}(f)|^2}{S_{n}(f)} df $$\nThe problem states that the noise PSD can be considered constant over the signal's bandwidth, $S_{n}(f) \\approx S_{0}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$ \\rho^2 \\approx \\frac{4}{S_{0}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df $$\nThe Fourier transform $\\tilde{h}(f)$ of the signal $h(t)$ is defined as $\\tilde{h}(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t) \\exp(-i2\\pi f t) dt$. Instead of directly computing the Fourier transform and its integral, it is more direct to use Parseval's theorem, which states that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df$.\n\nSince the signal $h(t)$ is real, its Fourier transform satisfies $\\tilde{h}(-f) = \\tilde{h}^{*}(f)$, which implies $|\\tilde{h}(-f)|^2 = |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2$. This allows us to write:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df $$\nCombining these results, the integral needed for the SNR can be related to the time-domain signal:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt $$\nThe signal is given by $h(t) = A\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau)\\,\\cos(2\\pi f_{2} t)\\,u(t)$. It is non-zero only for $t \\ge 0$. The integral of the squared signal is:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( A\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau)\\,\\cos(2\\pi f_{2} t) \\right)^2 dt = A^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-2t/\\tau)\\,\\cos^2(2\\pi f_{2} t)\\,dt $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$, the integral becomes:\n$$ A^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-2t/\\tau) \\frac{1+\\cos(4\\pi f_{2} t)}{2} dt = \\frac{A^2}{2} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-2t/\\tau) dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-2t/\\tau) \\cos(4\\pi f_{2} t) dt \\right] $$\nThe first integral is straightforward:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-2t/\\tau) dt = \\left[ -\\frac{\\tau}{2} \\exp(-2t/\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{\\tau}{2} $$\nThe second integral is a standard form $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-ax} \\cos(bx) dx = \\frac{a}{a^2+b^2}$. Here, $a=2/\\tau$ and $b=4\\pi f_{2}$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-2t/\\tau) \\cos(4\\pi f_{2} t) dt = \\frac{2/\\tau}{(2/\\tau)^2 + (4\\pi f_{2})^2} = \\frac{2\\tau}{4 + (4\\pi f_{2} \\tau)^2} = \\frac{\\tau}{2} \\frac{1}{1 + (2\\pi f_{2} \\tau)^2} $$\nThe product $f_{2}\\tau = (2.5 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz})(2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 50$, which is much greater than $1$. Thus, the quantity $(2\\pi f_{2} \\tau)^2 \\gg 1$, and the second integral term is negligible compared to the first. This is a common and highly accurate approximation for such signals. Therefore, we have:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt \\approx \\frac{A^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\tau}{2} \\right) = \\frac{A^2 \\tau}{4} $$\nSubstituting this back, we find the integral of the squared Fourier transform:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt \\approx \\frac{A^2 \\tau}{8} $$\nNow we can write the expression for the squared SNR:\n$$ \\rho^2 \\approx \\frac{4}{S_{0}} \\left( \\frac{A^2 \\tau}{8} \\right) = \\frac{A^2 \\tau}{2S_{0}} $$\nThe SNR is therefore $\\rho \\approx A \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}}$.\n\nThe signal amplitude $A$ scales inversely with luminosity distance $D$, so $A(D) = k/D$ for some constant $k$. Using the reference values, $k = A_{\\mathrm{ref}} D_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. Thus, the amplitude at an arbitrary distance $D$ is:\n$$ A(D) = A_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{D} $$\nSubstituting this into the SNR expression gives the SNR as a function of distance:\n$$ \\rho(D) = A_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{D} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}} $$\nWe need to find the distance $D_{5}$ for which the SNR is $\\rho=5$.\n$$ 5 = A_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{D_{5}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}} $$\nSolving for $D_{5}$:\n$$ D_{5} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{ref}} D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{5} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $A_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-22}$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$\n- $\\tau = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $S_{0} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-50}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term inside the square root:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{2 \\times (9.0 \\times 10^{-50}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1})} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{18.0 \\times 10^{-50}} \\,\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 1.111 \\times 10^{47} $$\nThe square root is:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{9} \\times 10^{47}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{9} \\times 10^{46}} = \\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{23} $$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $D_{5}$:\n$$ D_{5} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-22}) \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{Mpc})}{5} \\left( \\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{23} \\right) $$\n$$ D_{5} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-21}}{5} \\times \\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{24} \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} $$\n$$ D_{5} = \\frac{10}{15} \\times 10^{3} \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} = \\frac{1000}{15} \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} = \\frac{200}{3} \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} $$\n$$ D_{5} = 66.666... \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ D_{5} \\approx 66.7 \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} $$",
