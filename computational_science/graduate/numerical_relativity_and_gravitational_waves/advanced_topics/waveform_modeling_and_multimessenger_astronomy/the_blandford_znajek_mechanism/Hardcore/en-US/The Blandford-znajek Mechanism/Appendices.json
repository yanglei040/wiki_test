            "problem": "Consider a Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, force-free magnetosphere with split-monopole poloidal magnetic topology. Work in geometrized units where $G=c=1$. The magnetosphere is described by Maxwell’s equations in curved spacetime, $\\nabla_{a} F^{ab} = 4\\pi J^{b}$ and $\\nabla_{[a} F_{bc]} = 0$, together with the force-free condition $F_{ab} J^{b} = 0$ and the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor $T^{a}{}_{b} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left(F^{ac} F_{bc} - \\frac{1}{4} \\delta^{a}{}_{b} F^{cd} F_{cd}\\right)$. The electromagnetic power extracted through the event horizon is defined by the energy flux $P = -\\int T^{r}{}_{t}\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\,{\\rm d}\\theta\\,{\\rm d}\\phi$ evaluated on the horizon.\n\nTask 1 (derivation): Starting from these fundamental laws and assuming stationarity, axisymmetry, and regularity of the fields at the horizon, build a perturbative scheme in the small-spin limit $a/M \\ll 1$ to show that the leading-order electromagnetic extraction power scales quadratically with the spin, i.e., $P \\propto (a/M)^{2}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem concerning the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for power extraction from a rotating black hole. The problem combines a standard theoretical derivation in relativistic astrophysics with a typical numerical convergence analysis, both based on established principles and methods. All necessary information and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of Power Scaling\n\nThe electromagnetic power $P$ extracted from the black hole is the integrated energy flux crossing the event horizon. The problem defines this as $P = -\\int T^{r}{}_{t}\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\,{\\rm d}\\theta\\,{\\rm d}\\phi$. The fundamental insight of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is that a rotating black hole, when threaded by magnetic field lines, acts as a unipolar inductor.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Conditions**: We begin with the assumptions of a stationary, axisymmetric, force-free magnetosphere. The force-free condition, $F_{ab} J^{b} = 0$, implies that the electromagnetic field is degenerate. This allows for the existence of a scalar field $\\Omega_{\\rm F}$, the field line angular velocity, which is constant along each magnetic field line. The electric field is related to the magnetic field via $\\vec{E} \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$, and in the context of a rotating spacetime, the 4-potential components are related by $A_t = \\Omega_{\\rm F} A_\\phi + \\text{constant}$.\n\n2.  **Horizon Regularity (Znajek Condition)**: For the electromagnetic fields to be regular and finite in the frame of a zero-angular-momentum observer (ZAMO) at the event horizon ($r=r_+$), the field line angular velocity $\\Omega_{\\rm F}$ must match the angular velocity of the black hole's horizon, $\\Omega_{\\rm H}$. This is the Znajek condition: $\\Omega_{\\rm F}|_{r=r_+} = \\Omega_{\\rm H}$.\n\n3.  **Circuit Analogy and Power Scaling**: The system can be conceptualized as an electrical circuit. The rotating black hole acts as a battery. The potential difference (electromotive force, EMF) generated by the rotating conductor (the horizon) in a magnetic field is proportional to both the angular velocity and the magnetic flux. The total magnetic flux threading the horizon is $\\Phi_{\\rm BH}$. Therefore, the potential difference across the open field lines is $V \\propto \\Omega_{\\rm H} \\Phi_{\\rm BH}$.\n\n4.  The magnetosphere and the horizon itself present an effective resistance, $R_{\\text{eff}}$, to the flow of current. The total current $I$ driven by the potential $V$ is given by Ohm's law, $I = V/R_{\\text{eff}}$. For a given magnetic field geometry (like the specified split-monopole), the effective resistance is a constant determined by the global structure of the magnetosphere. Thus, the current is proportional to the voltage: $I \\propto V \\propto \\Omega_{\\rm H} \\Phi_{\\rm BH}$.\n\n5.  The total power dissipated in this circuit is given by $P = I V$. Substituting the proportionalities for $I$ and $V$, we get:\n$$P \\propto (\\Omega_{\\rm H} \\Phi_{\\rm BH}) \\times (\\Omega_{\\rm H} \\Phi_{\\rm BH}) = (\\Omega_{\\rm H} \\Phi_{\\rm BH})^2$$\nThis can be written with a dimensionless constant of proportionality, $\\kappa$, which encapsulates the details of the field geometry and effective resistance:\n$$P = \\kappa\\,\\Omega_{\\rm H}^{2}\\,\\Phi_{\\rm BH}^{2}$$\nThis confirms the desired analytical form.\n\n6.  **Small-Spin Limit**: The problem requires showing the scaling $P \\propto (a/M)^2$ in the small-spin limit ($a/M \\ll 1$). For this limit, the problem provides the approximation for the horizon angular velocity:\n$$\\Omega_{\\rm H} \\approx \\frac{a}{4M^{2}}$$\nThe magnetic flux $\\Phi_{\\rm BH}$ is determined by the external astrophysical environment that sources the magnetic field. To leading order in a perturbative expansion in $a/M$, the magnetic field structure and thus the flux $\\Phi_{\\rm BH}$ are independent of the black hole's spin. Therefore, $\\Phi_{\\rm BH}$ can be treated as a constant parameter in the small-spin limit.\n\n7.  Substituting the approximation for $\\Omega_{\\rm H}$ into the power law yields:\n$$P = \\kappa \\left(\\frac{a}{4M^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\Phi_{\\rm BH}^{2} = \\kappa \\frac{\\Phi_{\\rm BH}^{2}}{16 M^4} a^2$$\nExpressing this in terms of the dimensionless spin $a/M$:\n$$P = \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\Phi_{\\rm BH}^{2}}{16 M^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a}{M}\\right)^{2}$$\nSince $\\kappa$, $\\Phi_{\\rm BH}$, and $M$ are treated as constants for a given setup, we have demonstrated the required scaling: $P \\propto (a/M)^2$.\n\n### Task 2: Numerical Validation and Determination of $\\kappa$\n\nWe are given numerical simulation results for the power $P(h)$ at three different grid resolutions $h$ and a convergence model $P(h) = P_{0} + C\\,h^{p}$.\n\n**Step 1: Infer the order of convergence $p$**\n\nThe resolutions are $h_1 = 1/32$, $h_2 = 1/64$, and $h_3 = 1/128$. The refinement factor between successive simulations is $r = h_{i}/h_{i+1} = 2$.\nThe data points are:\n$P_1 = P(h_1) = 0.00333515625$\n$P_2 = P(h_2) = 0.0033205078125$\n$P_3 = P(h_3) = 0.003316845703125$\n\nWe form the ratio of differences in power between consecutive resolutions:\n$$\\frac{P(h_1) - P(h_2)}{P(h_2) - P(h_3)} = \\frac{(P_0 + C h_1^p) - (P_0 + C h_2^p)}{(P_0 + C h_2^p) - (P_0 + C h_3^p)} = \\frac{C(h_1^p - h_2^p)}{C(h_2^p - h_3^p)} = \\frac{h_2^p(r^p - 1)}{h_3^p(r^p - 1)} = \\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_3}\\right)^p = r^p$$\nCalculating the numerical differences:\n$P_1 - P_2 = 0.00333515625 - 0.0033205078125 = 0.0000146484375$\n$P_2 - P_3 = 0.0033205078125 - 0.003316845703125 = 0.000003662109375$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{P_1 - P_2}{P_2 - P_3} = \\frac{0.0000146484375}{0.000003662109375} = 4$$\nSince $r=2$, we have $r^p = 2^p = 4$, which implies that the order of convergence is $p=2$.\n\n**Step 2: Perform Richardson extrapolation for $P_0$**\n\nThe formula for Richardson extrapolation to the continuum ($h \\to 0$) is:\n$$P_0 \\approx P(h_3) + \\frac{P(h_3) - P(h_2)}{r^p - 1}$$\nSubstituting the known values ($p=2$, $r=2$):\n$$P_0 \\approx P_3 + \\frac{P_3 - P_2}{2^2 - 1} = P_3 - \\frac{P_2 - P_3}{3}$$\n$$P_0 \\approx 0.003316845703125 - \\frac{0.000003662109375}{3}$$\n$$P_0 \\approx 0.003316845703125 - 0.000001220703125 = 0.003315625$$\nSo, the extrapolated continuum power is $P_0 = 0.003315625$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the dimensionless coefficient $\\kappa$**\n\nFrom Task 1, we have the relation $P = \\kappa\\,\\Omega_{\\rm H}^{2}\\,\\Phi_{\\rm BH}^{2}$. We solve for $\\kappa$:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{P}{\\Omega_{\\rm H}^{2}\\,\\Phi_{\\rm BH}^{2}}$$\nWe use the continuum power $P = P_0 = 0.003315625$. The problem provides the simulation parameters:\n- Black hole mass $M=1$.\n- Spin parameter $a/M = 0.1$, which gives $a=0.1$.\n- Magnetic flux $\\Phi_{\\rm BH} = 10$.\n\nWe must use the specified approximation for the horizon angular velocity:\n$$\\Omega_{\\rm H} \\approx \\frac{a}{4M^{2}} = \\frac{0.1}{4(1)^2} = 0.025$$\nNow we can compute $\\kappa$:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{0.003315625}{(0.025)^2 \\times (10)^2} = \\frac{0.003315625}{0.000625 \\times 100} = \\frac{0.003315625}{0.0625}$$\n$$\\kappa = 0.05305$$\nThe problem asks for the answer rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.05305$ already has four significant figures.",

            "introduction": "The previous exercise established that the extracted power is proportional to an efficiency factor, $\\kappa$. A crucial question in the theory is what physical principles determine this factor.

This theoretical exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation of the classic result $\\Omega_F = \\frac{1}{2}\\Omega_H$ for a monopolar magnetic field configuration, where $\\Omega_H$ is the angular velocity of the black hole's horizon . This unique solution arises from the profound physical requirement that the electromagnetic fields must remain well-behaved (regular) at two critical boundaries: the event horizon and the distant light cylinder, demonstrating how global consistency conditions determine the engine's operating speed.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the field-line angular velocity, $\\Omega_F(\\Psi)$, for a force-free magnetosphere around a slowly rotating Kerr black hole, under the assumption of an asymptotically monopolar magnetic field. The derivation is to be performed to the first non-trivial order in the black hole's dimensionless spin parameter, $\\epsilon \\equiv a/M$. The solution must be uniquely determined by applying two independent regularity conditions: one at the event horizon and one at the outer light surface.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**1.1.

Validation against Criteria:**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is a cornerstone of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, a widely accepted model for energy extraction from rotating black holes, and is firmly rooted in general relativity and electromagnetism. The setup is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear physical system with well-defined governing equations and boundary conditions. The assumptions, such as the perturbative expansion and the monopolar field structure, are standard in this context and lead to a well-posed mathematical problem.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and precise, with no subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nAll validation criteria are met. The problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of $\\Omega_F(\\Psi)$\n\nThe problem can be elegantly solved by adopting the \"membrane paradigm\" or an equivalent circuit analogy, which is a rigorous consequence of the underlying equations of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics. In this framework, the rotating black hole acts as a power source (a battery with an internal resistance), and the magnetosphere extending to infinity acts as a load.\n\nA stationary, axisymmetric, force-free magnetosphere is characterized by field lines that are equipotentials, meaning the field-line angular velocity $\\Omega_F$ is constant along any given field line, i.e., $\\Omega_F = \\Omega_F(\\Psi)$. Similarly, the total poloidal current flowing inside a given flux surface is also a function of $\\Psi$ alone, $I = I(\\Psi)$. For a stationary solution to exist globally, connecting the black hole horizon to infinity, the physical conditions at both boundaries must be simultaneously satisfied by the same functions $\\Omega_F(\\Psi)$ and $I(\\Psi)$.\n\n**Constraint 1: The Znajek Horizon Condition**\n\nThe first regularity condition is imposed at the event horizon, $r=r_H$. In the membrane paradigm, the event horizon of a rotating black hole behaves as a conductor with a finite surface resistivity. The physical requirement that fields remain regular and that energy and angular momentum can be exchanged between the black hole and the magnetosphere is known as the Znajek condition. This condition effectively defines the \"internal resistance\" or impedance of the black hole as a source.\n\nThe \"voltage\" drop across the horizon's surface (from the perspective of the external circuit) is related to the difference between the hole's angular velocity, $\\Omega_H$, and the field line angular velocity, $\\Omega_F$. The differential voltage across a flux tube $d\\Psi$ is given by:\n$$ dV_H = (\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F) d\\Psi $$\nThe poloidal current flowing is $I(\\Psi)$. The effective impedance of the horizon, $Z_H$, is defined by the ratio of differential voltage to current, $Z_H = dV_H/I$. However, it's more convenient to work with admittance per unit flux tube, which relates the current $I$ to the voltage drop. The current $I(\\Psi)$ is driven by the potential difference. This allows us to write a relationship between the derivative of the current with respect to flux and the potential drop:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{d\\Psi} = \\frac{\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F}{Z_H(\\Psi)} $$\nwhere $Z_H(\\Psi)$ is the impedance of the horizon per flux tube defined by $\\Psi$. For a Kerr black hole, a detailed calculation shows that this impedance is equivalent to the impedance of free space, $Z_0 = 4\\pi$ in geometrized units, and is independent of $\\Psi$.\n$$ Z_H = 4\\pi $$\nThus, the horizon regularity condition provides our first relation between $I(\\Psi)$ and $\\Omega_F(\\Psi)$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{d\\Psi} = \\frac{\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F}{4\\pi} \\quad \\quad (1) $$\n\n**Constraint 2: The Light-Cylinder Condition**\n\nThe second regularity condition is imposed at the outer light surface. This surface is the location of the fast magnetosonic critical point for a cold, force-free plasma. For the wind to pass smoothly through this point, the governing Grad-Shafranov equation must remain regular. This physical requirement translates to a condition on the external magnetosphere, which acts as the \"load\" in our circuit analogy.\n\nThe voltage drop across the load (from the axis to the flux surface $\\Psi$) is related to the work done to drive currents to infinity:\n$$ dV_L = \\Omega_F d\\Psi $$\nThe load impedance, $Z_L(\\Psi)$, is defined analogously to the horizon impedance. It relates the current flowing through the load to the voltage across it:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{d\\Psi} = \\frac{\\Omega_F}{Z_L(\\Psi)} \\quad \\quad (2) $$\nThe problem specifies that the magnetic field is monopolar. For a purely monopolar field configuration extending into asymptotically flat space, the impedance of the outgoing wind is a well-known result. It is also equal to the impedance of free space, independent of $\\Psi$:\n$$ Z_L = 4\\pi $$\nThis specific result is the consequence of the \"flat-space force-free light-cylinder condition for a rotating monopole\" mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n**Determining $\\Omega_F$**\n\nFor a self-consistent, stationary solution, the poloidal current $I(\\Psi)$ must be a single, continuous function of $\\Psi$. Therefore, the expression for $dI/d\\Psi$ derived from the horizon condition (1) must be identical to the one derived from the light-cylinder condition (2).\n$$ \\frac{\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F}{Z_H} = \\frac{\\Omega_F}{Z_L} $$\nSubstituting the impedance values $Z_H = 4\\pi$ and $Z_L = 4\\pi$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F}{4\\pi} = \\frac{\\Omega_F}{4\\pi} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\Omega_H - \\Omega_F = \\Omega_F $$\n$$ 2\\Omega_F = \\Omega_H $$\nSolving for $\\Omega_F$ gives the unique result:\n$$ \\Omega_F = \\frac{1}{2} \\Omega_H $$\nThis result holds for all field lines $\\Psi$ that connect the black hole to the asymptotic region. The problem states that we are interested in this specific configuration. To the leading order in $\\epsilon = a/M$, both $\\Omega_F$ and $\\Omega_H$ are $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$, so this relation is consistent with the perturbative scheme. The horizon angular velocity is $\\Omega_H = a / (r_H^2 + a^2) \\approx a/(4M^2)$, so $\\Omega_F \\approx a/(8M^2)$. The problem asks for the expression for $\\Omega_F$ in terms of $\\Omega_H$.\n\nThe two independent regularity conditions—one physical constraint at the inner boundary (horizon) and one at the outer critical boundary (light cylinder)—uniquely determine the angular velocity of the force-free magnetosphere for a monopolar field configuration.",

Work in geometric units where the gravitational constant and the speed of light satisfy $G=c=1$. All quantities in this problem are therefore dimensionless, and all outputs must be reported as dimensionless numbers. The solution must proceed from the following fundamental base.\n\nStart from the definitions of Kerr horizon radius and horizon angular frequency. For a Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$ with $0 \\le a/M  1$, the event horizon radius is $r_H = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2}$ and the horizon angular frequency is $\\Omega_H = a / (2 r_H)$. In the stationary, axisymmetric, force-free limit, the electromagnetic energy flux through the horizon is built from the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor and depends quadratically on the electric and magnetic fields tangent and normal to the horizon, respectively. The dimensional analysis and regularity at the horizon (Znajek condition) imply that the extracted power factorizes into a function of $a/M$ and a part quadratic in horizon quantities. Your task is to test the hypothesis that a factorization into a function of $a/M$ and a product of two quadratic horizon quantities holds to leading order, and to quantify corrections at high spin by fitting a smooth spin-dependent coefficient.

Report the following outputs:\n   - The fitted coefficients $\\kappa_0$, $\\kappa_2$, and $\\kappa_4$.\n   - The maximum absolute relative deviation across the nonzero-power cases.\n   - The root-mean-square relative deviation across the nonzero-power cases.\n   - Two booleans for the two zero-power boundary checks at $a/M = 0$, in the order they appear.\n   - The list of per-case relative deviations for the nonzero-power cases, in the order the corresponding test cases appear.\n\nUse the following test suite of $9$ cases, each given as a tuple $(M,a,\\Phi_B,P_{\\mathrm{sim}})$:\n- Case $1$: ($1.0$, $0.0$, $1.0$, $0.0$)\n- Case $2$: ($1.0$, $0.1$, $0.8$, $0.0000176128$)\n- Case $3$: ($1.0$, $0.5$, $1.2$, $0.000999937$)\n- Case $4$: ($1.0$, $0.9$, $0.7$, $0.00121787$)\n- Case $5$: ($1.0$, $0.95$, $1.5$, $0.00673530$)\n- Case $6$: ($1.0$, $0.99$, $1.1$, $0.00471483$)\n- Case $7$: ($1.0$, $0.7$, $0.9$, $0.00112468$)\n- Case $8$: ($1.0$, $0.3$, $1.3$, $0.000420461$)\n- Case $9$: ($1.0$, $0.0$, $1.7$, $0.0$)\n\nAngle units are not used. All quantities are to be treated as dimensionless in geometric units. Your program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem concerning the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. The problem combines a standard theoretical derivation in relativistic astrophysics with a typical numerical convergence analysis, both based on established principles and methods. All necessary information and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies.\n\nThe solution framework is to determine a semi-analytic model for the power $P_{\\mathrm{model}}$ extracted from a Kerr black hole and test it against synthetic simulation data $P_{\\mathrm{sim}}$. The physical basis is the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, where the power is proportional to the square of the magnetic flux threading the horizon, $\\Phi_B^2$, and the square of the horizon's angular frequency, $\\Omega_H^2$. The model is given by\n$$P_{\\mathrm{model}} = \\kappa(a/M) \\Phi_B^2 \\Omega_H^2$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is a dimensionless efficiency factor that depends on the black hole's dimensionless spin, $\\chi = a/M$. We are given a polynomial approximation for this function:\n$$\\kappa(\\chi) \\approx \\kappa_0 + \\kappa_2 \\chi^2 + \\kappa_4 \\chi^4$$\nThe constants $\\kappa_0$, $\\kappa_2$, and $\\kappa_4$ are to be determined by a fit to the provided data.\n\nFirst, we isolate the unknown function $\\kappa(\\chi)$ by rearranging the power equation:\n$$\\kappa(\\chi) = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{sim}}}{\\Phi_B^2 \\Omega_H^2}$$\nThis equation transforms our problem into a standard polynomial regression. For each data point $i$ in the test suite with non-zero spin ($a_i \\neq 0$), we will compute a \"measured\" value of $\\kappa(\\chi_i)$. Let $y_i = P_{\\mathrm{sim},i} / (\\Phi_{B,i}^2 \\Omega_{H,i}^2)$ and $x_i = \\chi_i^2 = (a_i/M_i)^2$. The fitting problem becomes:\n$$y_i = \\kappa_0 + \\kappa_2 x_i + \\kappa_4 x_i^2$$\nThis is a linear model for the coefficients $(\\kappa_0, \\kappa_2, \\kappa_4)$. We can solve for these coefficients using the method of least squares. We construct a linear system $A\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{c} = [\\kappa_0, \\kappa_2, \\kappa_4]^T$. For each of the $N=7$ non-zero spin cases, we form a row of the design matrix $A$ and an element of the observation vector $\\mathbf{b}$:\n- The $i$-th row of $A$ is $[1, x_i, x_i^2] = [1, \\chi_i^2, \\chi_i^4]$.\n- The $i$-th element of $\\mathbf{b}$ is $b_i = y_i$.\n\nThe horizon properties for each case are calculated using the given formulas, noting that $M=1$ for all cases:\n- $\\chi_i = a_i/M_i = a_i$\n- $r_{H,i} = M_i + \\sqrt{M_i^2 - a_i^2} = 1 + \\sqrt{1 - a_i^2}$\n- $\\Omega_{H,i} = a_i / (2 r_{H,i})$\n\nThe least-squares solution for $\\mathbf{c}$ minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\|A\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{b}\\|_2$, and is computed via standard numerical linear algebra routines.\n\nOnce the coefficients $\\kappa_0, \\kappa_2, \\kappa_4$ are found, we can evaluate the model's accuracy. For each of the $N=7$ fitting cases, we compute the model's prediction for power, $P_{\\mathrm{model}, i}$, and the corresponding relative deviation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{model}, i} = (\\kappa_0 + \\kappa_2\\chi_i^2 + \\kappa_4\\chi_i^4) \\Phi_{B,i}^2 \\Omega_{H,i}^2$$\n$$\\delta_i = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{sim},i} - P_{\\mathrm{model},i}}{P_{\\mathrm{model},i}}$$\nFrom the set of these deviations, we calculate the maximum absolute relative deviation, $\\max(|\\delta_i|)$, and the root-mean-square (RMS) relative deviation, $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\delta_i^2}$.\n\nFor the boundary cases where $a=0$, we have $\\Omega_H=0$ and thus $P_{\\mathrm{model}}=0$. We check for consistency by verifying that the absolute difference between the simulated and model power is within a given tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-12}$: $|P_{\\mathrm{sim}} - 0| \\le \\tau$.\n\nFinally, all computed values are collected, rounded to $6$ decimal places as required, and formatted into a single output string. The booleans from the zero-power checks are reported as `True` or `False`.",
