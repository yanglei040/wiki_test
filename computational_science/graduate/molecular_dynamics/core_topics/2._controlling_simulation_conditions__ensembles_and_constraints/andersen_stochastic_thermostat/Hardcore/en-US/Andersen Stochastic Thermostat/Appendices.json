            "problem": "You are to design and implement an explicit sampling and verification procedure for the Andersen stochastic thermostat in molecular dynamics. The task consists of two parts: (i) sampling Maxwell–Boltzmann velocities for particles with heterogeneous masses, and (ii) implementing a statistically rigorous test that verifies whether sampled velocity components have the correct variance implied by thermodynamic equilibrium. Your final output must be produced by a single complete program as specified below.\n\nThe foundation of the task must be derived from first principles. Use the canonical ensemble at fixed temperature as the base. Begin from the fundamental facts that, for a single particle of mass $m$ at absolute temperature $T$, the canonical momentum distribution factorizes, and each Cartesian velocity component $v_{\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$ is independent with a Gaussian density proportional to $\\exp\\!\\big(-\\beta \\tfrac{1}{2} m v_{\\alpha}^{2}\\big)$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_{B} T)$ and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. Do not assume any pre-derived sampling formula beyond these principles. Justify every step of your algorithmic design using these principles.\n\nYou must incorporate the Andersen stochastic thermostat process. In the Andersen thermostat, each particle undergoes stochastic collisions according to a Poisson process of rate $\\nu$ (collisions per second). Over a discrete time step of duration $\\Delta t$, the probability that a particle experiences at least one collision is $p = 1 - \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t)$. If a collision occurs, the particle’s Cartesian velocity components are instantaneously re-drawn from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at the target temperature $T$; otherwise, the velocity remains unchanged.\n\nYour program must:\n- Implement a function that samples velocities for $N$ particles with heterogeneous masses, i.e., distinct $m_{i}$ for $i=1,\\dots,N$, at temperature $T$. Use three dimensions unless otherwise specified by a test. The sample for particle $i$ must have independent components with zero mean and variance $k_{B} T / m_{i}$.\n- Implement a single-step Andersen thermostat update that, given the current velocities, applies independent Bernoulli collisions with probability $p = 1 - \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t)$ to each particle. For collided particles, reassign their velocities from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution corresponding to their own masses and the target temperature $T$.\n- Implement a statistical test that verifies the variance condition implied by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Specifically, given a sample of velocities $\\{v_{i,\\alpha}\\}$, masses $\\{m_{i}\\}$, and a temperature $T$, define the standardized components $z_{i,\\alpha} = v_{i,\\alpha} \\sqrt{m_{i}/(k_{B} T)}$. Under the correct Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, the $z_{i,\\alpha}$ are independent standard normal random variables. Therefore, the statistic\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d} z_{i,\\alpha}^{2}\n$$\nhas a chi-square distribution with $dN$ degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis that the variance equals $k_{B} T / m_{i}$. Your test must implement a two-sided chi-square acceptance criterion at a user-specified significance level $\\alpha$ by checking whether $S$ lies between the $\\alpha/2$ and $1-\\alpha/2$ quantiles of the chi-square distribution with $dN$ degrees of freedom.\n\nUnits:\n- Masses $m_{i}$ must be provided in kilograms $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Temperature $T$ must be in kelvin $\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$ must be used in the value $k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$.\n- The algorithm must output velocities in meters per second $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- Time step $\\Delta t$ must be in seconds $\\mathrm{s}$, and collision rate $\\nu$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nYour program must run the following test suite. For each test case, return a boolean indicating whether the chi-square variance test accepts the null hypothesis at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n- Test case $1$ (heterogeneous masses, general case):\n  - $N = 2000$, $d = 3$.\n  - Temperature $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - Masses are independently drawn with equal probability from the set $\\{28, 40, 84\\}$ unified atomic mass units, converted to kilograms by multiplying each atomic mass unit by $1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. That is, available masses are $28\\,\\mathrm{u}$, $40\\,\\mathrm{u}$, and $84\\,\\mathrm{u}$ in $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n  - Sample fresh Maxwell–Boltzmann velocities and perform the chi-square variance test.\n  - Use a fixed random seed to ensure determinism.\n\n- Test case $2$ (moderate sample size with wide mass heterogeneity):\n  - $N = 90$, $d = 3$.\n  - Temperature $T = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - Masses are linearly spaced between $1\\,\\mathrm{u}$ and $100\\,\\mathrm{u}$ across the $N$ particles, converted to $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n  - Sample fresh Maxwell–Boltzmann velocities and perform the chi-square variance test.\n  - Use a fixed random seed to ensure determinism.\n\n- Test case $3$ (Andersen thermostat thermalization over multiple steps):\n  - $N = 1000$, $d = 3$.\n  - Temperature $T = 500\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - Masses are drawn independently and uniformly from the interval $[10\\,\\mathrm{u}, 50\\,\\mathrm{u}]$, converted to $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n  - Initialize all velocities to zero.\n  - Apply $100$ Andersen steps with collision rate $\\nu = 2 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and time step $\\Delta t = 1 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n  - Perform the chi-square variance test on the final velocities.\n  - Use a fixed random seed to ensure determinism.\n\n- Test case $4$ (negative control to detect incorrect variance):\n  - $N = 1500$, $d = 2$.\n  - Temperature $T = 400\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - All masses equal to $20\\,\\mathrm{u}$ in $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n  - Sample Maxwell–Boltzmann velocities and then multiply all velocity components by a factor of $1.5$.\n  - Perform the chi-square variance test; it should reject the null hypothesis with high probability.\n  - Use a fixed random seed to ensure determinism.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},r_{4}]$, where each $r_{i}$ is a boolean indicating the acceptance or rejection of the variance test for test case $i$.\n\nYour program must be entirely self-contained and require no input. All random choices must be controlled by explicit fixed seeds to ensure deterministic output. The only permitted libraries are the Python standard library, NumPy, and SciPy.",
            "solution": "The task is to design and implement a procedure for sampling particle velocities from a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and to verify the correctness of the sample using a statistical test based on the chi-square distribution. This procedure is central to the Andersen stochastic thermostat used in molecular dynamics simulations. The entire process, from sampling to verification, will be derived from the principles of statistical mechanics.\n\n### 1. Theoretical Foundation: Maxwell–Boltzmann Velocity Distribution\n\nIn the canonical ensemble, a system of $N$ particles in volume $V$ is in thermal contact with a heat bath at a constant absolute temperature $T$. The probability of finding the system in a microstate with energy $E$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-\\beta E)$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_{B} T)$ and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor a classical system of non-interacting particles (or where potential energy is independent of momentum), the total kinetic energy is the sum of individual particle kinetic energies, $E_K = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m_i}$, where $\\mathbf{p}_i = m_i \\mathbf{v}_i$ is the momentum of particle $i$ with mass $m_i$. The phase space probability distribution for momenta factorizes, meaning the momentum of each particle is independent of the others. Furthermore, for a single particle, the distribution for each Cartesian component of momentum is independent. The probability density for a single velocity component, say $v_{i,\\alpha}$ for particle $i$ and component $\\alpha \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$, is derived from the kinetic energy term $\\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{i,\\alpha}^2$.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) for $v_{i,\\alpha}$ is given by:\n$$\nf(v_{i,\\alpha}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{i,\\alpha}^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_i v_{i,\\alpha}^2}{2 k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the functional form of a Gaussian (normal) distribution with a mean of $\\mu = 0$ and a variance of $\\sigma^2$. A general Gaussian PDF is $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$. By comparing the two forms, we identify the mean as $\\mu=0$ and the variance as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{i}^2 = \\frac{k_B T}{m_i}\n$$\nThus, at thermal equilibrium, each Cartesian velocity component $v_{i,\\alpha}$ of a particle with mass $m_i$ is an independent random variable drawn from a normal distribution $N(0, k_B T / m_i)$.\n\n### 2. Algorithmic Design: Velocity Sampling\n\nTo sample a velocity component $v_{i,\\alpha}$ from the distribution $N(0, k_B T / m_i)$, we can use the property that if $Z$ is a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim N(0,1)$, then $X = \\mu + \\sigma Z$ is a normal random variable $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. In our case, $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma_i = \\sqrt{k_B T / m_i}$. Therefore, a sample for $v_{i,\\alpha}$ can be generated as:\n$$\nv_{i,\\alpha} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{m_i}} \\times Z_{i,\\alpha}\n$$\nwhere each $Z_{i,\\alpha}$ is an independent sample from the standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$. Computationally, standard normal variates can be efficiently generated using established algorithms (e.g., Box-Muller transform, Ziggurat algorithm), which are readily available in numerical libraries like `numpy`.\n\nThe sampling procedure for a system of $N$ particles in $d$ dimensions is as follows:\n1.  For each particle $i=1, \\dots, N$ with mass $m_i$, calculate its velocity standard deviation $\\sigma_i = \\sqrt{k_B T / m_i}$.\n2.  Generate a matrix of $N \\times d$ independent random numbers from the standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$. Let this matrix be $\\mathbf{Z}$, with elements $Z_{i,\\alpha}$.\n3.  The velocity matrix $\\mathbf{V}$ with elements $v_{i,\\alpha}$ is then computed by scaling each row corresponding to particle $i$ by its respective $\\sigma_i$. In practice, this can be done by element-wise multiplication of the matrix $\\mathbf{Z}$ with a column vector of standard deviations broadcast across the dimensions.\n\n### 3. Algorithmic Design: Andersen Thermostat\n\nThe Andersen thermostat maintains the temperature of a system by modeling stochastic collisions with a virtual heat bath. The process is modeled as a series of independent events for each particle.\n- Over a small time step $\\Delta t$, each particle has a probability $p$ of undergoing a \"collision\". These collision events follow a Poisson process with a given rate $\\nu$. The probability of at least one collision occurring in $\\Delta t$ is $p = 1 - \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t)$.\n- If a particle is selected for a collision, its velocity is discarded and replaced with a new velocity drawn from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at the target temperature $T$, using the sampling procedure described above.\n- If a particle is not selected, its velocity evolves according to the system's dynamics (which, in the context of only applying the thermostat, means its velocity remains unchanged).\n\nA single step of the Andersen thermostat algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  For each particle $i=1, \\dots, N$, draw a random number $u_i$ from a uniform distribution on $[0,1)$.\n2.  If $u_i  p$, where $p = 1 - \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t)$, particle $i$ is marked for collision.\n3.  For all marked particles, resample their velocities $\\mathbf{v}_i = (v_{i,x}, v_{i,y}, v_{i,z})$ from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution $N(0, k_B T / m_i)$ for each component, as detailed in Section 2.\n4.  Velocities of unmarked particles remain unchanged.\n\n### 4. Statistical Verification: Chi-Square Test for Variance\n\nTo verify that the sampled velocities correctly obey the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, we can test if the variance of the velocity components matches the theoretical value $\\sigma_i^2 = k_B T / m_i$. A robust way to do this is a chi-square test.\n\nFirst, we standardize the sampled velocity components. A standardized variable is created by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. For a velocity component $v_{i,\\alpha}$, the corresponding standardized variable $z_{i,\\alpha}$ is:\n$$\nz_{i,\\alpha} = \\frac{v_{i,\\alpha} - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i} = \\frac{v_{i,\\alpha} - 0}{\\sqrt{k_B T/m_i}} = v_{i,\\alpha} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{k_B T}}\n$$\nUnder the null hypothesis that $v_{i,\\alpha}$ is correctly drawn from $N(0, k_B T / m_i)$, each $z_{i,\\alpha}$ is an independent standard normal random variable, $z_{i,\\alpha} \\sim N(0,1)$.\n\nThe square of a standard normal variable, $z_{i,\\alpha}^2$, follows a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom, $\\chi^2(1)$. The sum of $k$ independent $\\chi^2(1)$ variables follows a chi-square distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom, $\\chi^2(k)$. We can form a test statistic $S$ by summing the squares of all standardized components across all $N$ particles and all $d$ dimensions:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{d} z_{i,\\alpha}^{2}\n$$\nUnder the null hypothesis, $S$ follows a chi-square distribution with $df = N \\times d$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThe statistical test is performed as follows:\n1.  Specify a significance level $\\alpha$ (e.g., $\\alpha=0.05$). This represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error).\n2.  For a two-sided test, we find the critical values that enclose the central $1-\\alpha$ portion of the $\\chi^2(df)$ probability mass. These are the quantiles (or percent-point functions) at probabilities $\\alpha/2$ and $1-\\alpha/2$. Let these be $C_{low} = \\chi^2_{df}(\\alpha/2)$ and $C_{high} = \\chi^2_{df}(1-\\alpha/2)$.\n3.  Calculate the statistic $S$ from the velocity sample.\n4.  The null hypothesis is accepted if $S$ falls within the acceptance region: $C_{low} \\le S \\le C_{high}$. Otherwise, it is rejected. Rejection implies that the sample variance is statistically distinguishable from the theoretical variance.\n\nThis verification procedure is powerful because it aggregates information from the entire sample into a single statistic whose theoretical distribution is known, allowing for a rigorous quantitative check.",

In any interval $[t, t+dt]$, a collision occurs with probability $\\nu dt$, and no collision occurs with probability $1-\\nu dt$.\n\nLet's evaluate $C_{vv}(t+dt)$:\n$C_{vv}(t+dt) = \\langle v(t+dt)v(0) \\rangle$\nWe compute the expectation by conditioning on whether a collision occurs in $[t, t+dt]$.\n$v(t+dt) =\n\\begin{cases}\nv(t) + \\dot{v}(t)dt + O(dt^2)  \\text{with probability } 1-\\nu dt \\quad (\\text{no collision}) \\\\\nv'  \\text{with probability } \\nu dt \\quad (\\text{collision})\n\\end{cases}$\nHere, $v'$ is a new velocity drawn from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at temperature $T$. This distribution is symmetric, so its mean is zero, $\\langle v' \\rangle = 0$. Crucially, $v'$ is independent of the system's history, including $v(0)$.\n\nThe expectation is the sum of contributions from these two possibilities:\n$\\langle v(t+dt)v(0) \\rangle = (1-\\nu dt) \\langle (v(t)+\\dot{v}(t)dt)v(0) \\rangle + \\nu dt \\langle v'v(0) \\rangle$\nUsing the independence of $v'$ and $v(0)$, we have $\\langle v'v(0) \\rangle = \\langle v' \\rangle \\langle v(0) \\rangle = 0$.\nSo, dropping terms of order $dt^2$ and higher:\n$C_{vv}(t+dt) = (1-\\nu dt) (\\langle v(t)v(0) \\rangle + \\langle \\dot{v}(t)v(0) \\rangle dt) = C_{vv}(t) - \\nu C_{vv}(t)dt + \\langle \\dot{v}(t)v(0) \\rangle dt$\nRearranging and taking the limit $dt \\to 0$:\n$\\frac{dC_{vv}}{dt} = \\lim_{dt\\to 0} \\frac{C_{vv}(t+dt)-C_{vv}(t)}{dt} = -\\nu C_{vv}(t) + \\langle \\dot{v}(t)v(0) \\rangle$\n\nLet's define a cross-correlation function $C_{\\dot{v}v}(t) = \\langle \\dot{v}(t)v(0) \\rangle$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{vv}(t)}{dt} = -\\nu C_{vv}(t) + C_{\\dot{v}v}(t) \\quad (*)$$\n\nTo close the system, we need an equation for the time evolution of $C_{\\dot{v}v}(t)$.\n$C_{\\dot{v}v}(t) = \\langle \\dot{v}(t)v(0) \\rangle = \\langle (-\\omega^2 x(t)) v(0) \\rangle = -\\omega^2 \\langle x(t)v(0) \\rangle = -\\omega^2 C_{xv}(t)$\nNow let's find the derivative of $C_{\\dot{v}v}(t)$:\n$\\frac{dC_{\\dot{v}v}(t)}{dt} = -\\omega^2 \\frac{dC_{xv}(t)}{dt} = -\\omega^2 \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x(t)v(0) \\rangle$\n\nThe position $x(t)$ is continuous. Its time evolution is always given by $\\dot{x}(t)=v(t)$, irrespective of collisions (which only affect $v$ discontinuously and leave $x$ unchanged). Therefore,\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x(t)v(0) \\rangle = \\langle \\dot{x}(t)v(0) \\rangle = \\langle v(t)v(0) \\rangle = C_{vv}(t)$\nThus, we obtain the second equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{\\dot{v}v}(t)}{dt} = -\\omega^2 C_{vv}(t) \\quad (**) $$\n\nNow we have a closed system of two linear first-order ordinary differential equations. We can combine them into a single second-order ODE for $C_{vv}(t)$. Differentiating equation $(*)$ with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{d^2C_{vv}(t)}{dt^2} = -\\nu \\frac{dC_{vv}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{dC_{\\dot{v}v}(t)}{dt}$\nSubstituting equation $(**)$ into this gives:\n$\\frac{d^2C_{vv}(t)}{dt^2} = -\\nu \\frac{dC_{vv}(t)}{dt} - \\omega^2 C_{vv}(t)$\n\nThis is the desired closed ODE for the VACF:\n$$ \\frac{d^2C_{vv}(t)}{dt^2} + \\nu \\frac{dC_{vv}(t)}{dt} + \\omega^2 C_{vv}(t) = 0 $$\n\n### Initial Conditions\nTo solve this ODE, we need two initial conditions, $C_{vv}(0)$ and $\\dot{C}_{vv}(0)$.\n1.  $C_{vv}(0) = \\langle v(0)^2 \\rangle$. The system is in canonical equilibrium at temperature $T$. The equipartition theorem states that each quadratic degree of freedom in the Hamiltonian contributes $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$ to the average energy. For the kinetic energy $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, we have $\\langle \\frac{1}{2}mv(0)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T$. This gives:\n    $$ C_{vv}(0) = \\langle v(0)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{m} $$\n2.  $\\dot{C}_{vv}(0) = \\left. \\frac{dC_{vv}(t)}{dt} \\right|_{t=0}$. From equation $(*)$ at $t=0$:\n    $\\dot{C}_{vv}(0) = -\\nu C_{vv}(0) + C_{\\dot{v}v}(0)$\n    $C_{\\dot{v}v}(0) = \\langle \\dot{v}(0)v(0) \\rangle = \\langle (-\\omega^2 x(0))v(0) \\rangle = -\\omega^2\\langle x(0)v(0) \\rangle$.\n    For a harmonic oscillator in canonical equilibrium, the joint probability distribution $P(x,v)$ is proportional to $\\exp(-(\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2)/k_B T)$, which is a product of functions of $x$ and $v$. Thus, position and velocity are statistically independent. Since the potential is symmetric, $\\langle x(0) \\rangle = 0$. Therefore, $\\langle x(0)v(0) \\rangle = \\langle x(0) \\rangle \\langle v(0) \\rangle = 0$. This implies $C_{\\dot{v}v}(0)=0$.\n    The initial derivative is then:\n    $$ \\dot{C}_{vv}(0) = -\\nu C_{vv}(0) = -\\frac{\\nu k_B T}{m} $$\n\n### Solution of the ODE\nWe solve $\\ddot{C} + \\nu\\dot{C} + \\omega^2 C = 0$ with $C(0)=\\frac{k_B T}{m}$ and $\\dot{C}(0)=-\\frac{\\nu k_B T}{m}$.\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 + \\nu r + \\omega^2 = 0$, with roots:\n$r_{1,2} = \\frac{-\\nu \\pm \\sqrt{\\nu^2 - 4\\omega^2}}{2} = -\\frac{\\nu}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu^2}{4} - \\omega^2}$\n\nThe form of the solution depends on the sign of the discriminant $\\Delta = \\nu^2 - 4\\omega^2$.\n\n**Case 1: Underdamped ($\\nu  2\\omega$)**\nThe roots are complex conjugates: $r_{1,2} = -\\frac{\\nu}{2} \\pm i\\Omega'$, where $\\Omega' = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\frac{\\nu^2}{4}}$.\nThe general solution is $C_{vv}(t) = e^{-\\nu t/2}(A\\cos(\\Omega' t) + B\\sin(\\Omega' t))$.\nApplying initial conditions:\n$C_{vv}(0) = A = \\frac{k_B T}{m}$.\n$\\dot{C}_{vv}(0) = -\\frac{\\nu}{2}A + B\\Omega' = -\\frac{\\nu k_B T}{m}$.\n$-\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\frac{k_B T}{m} + B\\Omega' = -\\frac{\\nu k_B T}{m} \\implies B\\Omega' = -\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\frac{k_B T}{m} \\implies B = -\\frac{\\nu}{2\\Omega'}\\frac{k_B T}{m}$.\nThe solution is:\n$C_{vv}(t) = \\frac{k_B T}{m} e^{-\\nu t/2} \\left( \\cos(\\Omega' t) - \\frac{\\nu}{2\\Omega'} \\sin(\\Omega' t) \\right)$.\n\n**Case 2: Overdamped ($\\nu  2\\omega$)**\nThe roots are real and distinct: $r_{1,2} = -\\frac{\\nu}{2} \\pm \\Omega$, where $\\Omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu^2}{4} - \\omega^2}$.\nThe solution is $C_{vv}(t) = \\frac{k_B T}{m} e^{-\\nu t/2} \\left( \\cosh(\\Omega t) - \\frac{\\nu}{2\\Omega} \\sinh(\\Omega t) \\right)$. This can be obtained from the underdamped solution by substituting $\\Omega' = i\\Omega$ and using $\\cos(i\\theta)=\\cosh(\\theta)$, $\\sin(i\\theta)=i\\sin h(\\theta)$.\n\n**Case 3: Critically damped ($\\nu = 2\\omega$)**\nThe roots are real and repeated: $r_1=r_2=-\\frac{\\nu}{2}=-\\omega$.\nThe general solution is $C_{vv}(t) = (A+Bt)e^{-\\nu t/2}$.\n$C_{vv}(0) = A = \\frac{k_B T}{m}$.\n$\\dot{C}_{vv}(0) = B - \\frac{\\nu}{2}A = -\\frac{\\nu k_B T}{m}$.\n$B - \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\frac{k_B T}{m} = -\\nu\\frac{k_B T}{m} \\implies B=-\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\frac{k_B T}{m}$.\nThe solution is $C_{vv}(t) = \\frac{k_B T}{m} (1-\\frac{\\nu}{2}t)e^{-\\nu t/2}$. This is also the limit of the under- and overdamped solutions as $\\Omega, \\Omega' \\to 0$.\n\nFor all real, nonnegative $\\nu$ and $\\omega$, a single analytic expression can be written using the underdamped form, with the understanding that the functions are defined via analytic continuation for complex arguments (or by taking the appropriate limit in the critical case).\n\n### Condition for Damped Oscillations\nDamped oscillations occur when the solution contains sinusoidal terms, which corresponds to the underdamped case. The condition for this is that the roots of the characteristic equation are complex, which requires the discriminant to be negative:\n$\\nu^2 - 4\\omega^2  0 \\implies \\nu^2  4\\omega^2$.\nSince $\\nu$ and $\\omega$ are nonnegative, this gives the inequality:\n$$ \\nu  2\\omega $$\nThis is the parameter regime in which the VACF exhibits damped oscillations.\n\nThe single analytic expression that covers all cases is:\n$$ C_{vv}(t) = \\frac{k_B T}{m} e^{-\\frac{\\nu t}{2}} \\left[ \\cos\\left(t\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\frac{\\nu^2}{4}}\\right) - \\frac{\\nu}{2\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\frac{\\nu^2}{4}}} \\sin\\left(t\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\frac{\\nu^2}{4}}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis expression is to be interpreted using $\\cosh$ and $\\sinh$ if the argument of the square root is negative, and as a limit if the argument is zero.",
