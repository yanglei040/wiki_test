The definitions provided are standard, and the problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The task is a formal mathematical derivation based on established principles.\n\nThe objective is to derive the Lagrangian linear bias, $b_{1}^{L}(M,z)$, which is defined by the response of the halo multiplicity function to a long-wavelength background density perturbation.

For this calculation, $M$ and $z$ are held fixed, so $\\sigma(M,z)$ is treated as a constant with respect to the differentiation variable $\\delta_b$.\n\nTo compute the derivative, we must apply the chain rule, since $f$ is a function of $\\nu$, which in turn is a function of $\\delta_{b}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln f(\\nu)}{\\partial \\delta_{b}} = \\frac{d \\ln f(\\nu)}{d\\nu} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\nu}{\\partial \\delta_{b}}\n$$\nWe will compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $\\ln f(\\nu)$ with respect to $\\nu$.\nThe function $f(\\nu)$ is $f(\\nu) = \\sqrt{2/\\pi}\\,\\nu\\,\\exp(-\\nu^{2}/2)$.\nTaking the natural logarithm, we get:\n$$\n\\ln f(\\nu) = \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\right) + \\ln(\\nu) + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu^{2}}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln f(\\nu) = \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\right) + \\ln(\\nu) - \\frac{\\nu^{2}}{2}\n$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $\\nu$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivations\n\n**Task 1: Mass variance scaling**\n\nWe begin with the definition of the mass variance, $\\sigma^{2}(R)$, for a power-law linear matter power spectrum, $P(k) = A k^{n}$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{dk}{2\\pi^{2}}\\,k^{2}\\,P(k)\\,|W(kR)|^{2} = \\frac{A}{2\\pi^{2}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} k^{n+2} |W(kR)|^{2} dk\n$$\nTo determine the scaling with the smoothing radius $R$, we perform a change of variables in the integral. Let $u = kR$, which implies $k = u/R$ and $dk = du/R$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R) = \\frac{A}{2\\pi^{2}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{u}{R}\\right)^{n+2} |W(u)|^{2} \\frac{du}{R}\n$$\nWe can factor out the terms depending on $R$ from the integral, as the integration is over the dimensionless variable $u$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R) = \\frac{A}{2\\pi^{2}} \\frac{1}{R^{n+3}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^{n+2} |W(u)|^{2} du\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^{n+2} |W(u)|^{2} du$ is a dimensionless constant that depends only on the spectral index $n$. The problem specifies that $-3  n  1$, which ensures the convergence of this integral for a top-hat filter. Therefore, we can write the scaling relation:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(R) \\propto R^{-(n+3)}\n$$\nTaking the square root, we find the scaling for the root-mean-square (rms) fluctuation, $\\sigma(R)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(R) \\propto R^{-(n+3)/2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the scaling with mass $M$, not radius $R$. The two are related by the definition of the Lagrangian mass enclosed by the smoothing radius $R$:\n$$\nM = \\frac{4pi}{3}\\,\\bar{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{m},0}\\,R^{3}\n$$\nSince $\\bar{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{m},0}$ is a constant, this implies $M \\propto R^{3}$, or equivalently, $R \\propto M^{1/3}$. Substituting this into the scaling relation for $\\sigma(R)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(M) \\propto (M^{1/3})^{-(n+3)/2} = M^{-(n+3)/6}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation for Task 1.\n\n**Task 2: High-mass halo bias scaling**\n\nWe are asked to derive the high-mass scaling of the Eulerian linear bias, $b(M,z)$, which is defined via the peak-background split as:\n$$\nb(M,z) = 1 + \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\ln n_{\\mathrm{h}}}{\\partial \\delta_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right|_{M,z}\n$$\nThe number density of halos is given by $n_{\\mathrm{h}}(M,z)=\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{m},0}/M\\right)\\,f(\\nu)\\,\\left|d\\ln \\sigma^{-1}/dM\\right|$.

Therefore, the terms $\\bar{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{m},0}/M$ and $|d\\ln \\sigma^{-1}/dM|$ are constant with respect to $\\delta_{\\mathrm{b}}$. The only dependence on $\\delta_{\\mathrm{b}}$ comes through the multiplicity function $f(\\nu)$.

Substituting this into the denominator gives the Lagrangian bias:\n$$\nb_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln n_{\\mathrm{h}}}{\\partial \\delta_{\\mathrm{b}}} = \\frac{\\nu^2 - 1}{\\delta_c}\n$$\nThe Eulerian bias is then $b(M,z) = 1 + b_{\\mathrm{L}} = 1 + \\frac{\\nu^2 - 1}{\\delta_c}$.\n\nWe are interested in the asymptotic behavior for high-mass halos, which corresponds to the limit $\\nu \\gg 1$. In this limit, $\\nu^2 - 1 \\approx \\nu^2$, and the additive term $1$ in the bias expression becomes negligible compared to the term proportional to $\\nu^2$. So, for $\\nu \\gg 1$:\n$$\nb(M,z) \\approx \\frac{\\nu^2}{\\delta_c}\n$$\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\nu$ back into this approximate expression:\n$$\nb(M,z) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\delta_c} \\left( \\frac{\\delta_c}{D(z)\\sigma(M)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\delta_c}{D(z)^2 \\sigma(M)^2}\n$$\nTo find the mass scaling at a fixed redshift $z$, we note that $\\delta_c$ and $D(z)$ are constants.
