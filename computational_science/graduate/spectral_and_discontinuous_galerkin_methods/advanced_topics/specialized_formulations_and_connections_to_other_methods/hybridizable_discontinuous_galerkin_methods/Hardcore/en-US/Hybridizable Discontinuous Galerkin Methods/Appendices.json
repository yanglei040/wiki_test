Since $\\boldsymbol{q}_{h}$ is a constant vector, we can apply the divergence theorem:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} (\\boldsymbolq_{h} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_{i}) |F_{i}| = \\int_{\\partial K} \\boldsymbol{q}_{h} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\, dS = \\int_{K} \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q}_{h} \\, dx\n$$\nAs $\\boldsymbol{q}_{h}$ is constant, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q}_{h} = 0$, so this term is zero. This is a crucial simplification for $\\mathbb{P}_{0}$ elements.\n\nThe conservation equation thus reduces to:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\tau_{i}(u_{h} - \\widehat{u}_{i}) |F_{i}| = \\int_{K} f \\, dx\n$$\nWe can now solve for the constant scalar unknown $u_{h}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\tau_{i} u_{h} |F_{i}| - \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\tau_{i} \\widehat{u}_{i} |F_{i}| = \\int_{K} f \\, dx\n$$\n$$\nu_{h} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\tau_{i} |F_{i}| \\right) = \\int_{K} f \\, dx + \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\tau_{i} |F_{i}| \\widehat{u}_{i}\n$$\nSince $\\tau_i > 0$ and $|F_i| > 0$, the sum in the parenthesis is strictly positive. Solving for $u_{h}$ gives the second part of the local solution operator:\n$$\nu_{h} = \\frac{\\int_{K} f \\, dx + \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\tau_{i} |F_{i}| \\widehat{u}_{i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\tau_{j} |F_{j}|}\n$$\n(A different summation index $j$ is used in the denominator for clarity.)\n\nCombining the expressions for $\\boldsymbol{q}_{h}$ and $u_{h}$, we obtain the explicit local solution operator that maps $\\{\\widehat{u}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{4}$ and $f$ to $(\\boldsymbol{q}_{h}, u_{h})$.",

We will first determine this size for the standard Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, denoted $S_{DG}$, and for the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, denoted $S_{HDG}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the dimension of the local polynomial spaces. The problem specifies that the dimension of the space of polynomials in $d$ variables of total degree at most $k$ is equal to the number of monomials. This number is given by the combinatorial formula $\\binom{k+d}{d}$.\n\nFor the element-wise spaces, we are on a two-dimensional domain ($d=2$) discretized by triangles.

We focus on the stabilization term $\\langle \\tau (u_h - \\hat{u}_h), v_h - \\hat{v}_h \\rangle_{\\partial K}$, which is essential for the coercivity of the HDG method. Coercivity is typically established by choosing $v_h = u_h$, $r_h=q_h$, and an appropriate test trace function $\\hat{v}_h$, leading to the term $\\int_F \\tau (u_h - \\hat{u}_h)^2 \\, dF$ on each face $F$. Let $w_h(x) = u_h(x)|_F - \\hat{u}_h(x)$. Since $u_h|_F \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$ and $\\hat{u}_h \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$, we have $w_h \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$. The integrand for the coercivity term is $\\tau(w_h)^2$, which is a polynomial of degree at most $2k$.\n\nAn exactly computed integral $\\int_F \\tau (w_h)^2 \\, dF$ is strictly positive for any non-zero $w_h \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$ since $\\tau > 0$. This ensures that the only function for which the stabilization term vanishes is the zero function, a critical property for stability.\n\nNow consider a quadrature rule $I_F^{2k-1}$ on face $F$, which is exact for polynomials of degree up to $2k-1$. The computed contribution is $I_F^{2k-1}(\\tau (w_h)^2)$. Standard quadrature rules, such as Gauss-type rules, use a set of quadrature points $\\{\\xi_j\\}$ and positive weights $\\{\\omega_j\\}$. The computed integral is $I_F^{2k-1}(\\tau (w_h)^2) = \\tau \\sum_j \\omega_j (w_h(\\xi_j))^2$. Since $\\tau>0$ and $\\omega_j>0$, this sum is zero if and only if $w_h(\\xi_j)=0$ for all quadrature points $\\xi_j$.\n\nThe question is whether a non-trivial $w_h \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$ can exist such that $w_h(\\xi_j)=0$ at all quadrature points of a rule exact to degree $2k-1$. A quadrature rule that is exact for polynomials of degree $2k-1$ can be constructed using $k$ points (e.g., the $k$-point Gauss-Legendre rule for a 1D face). A polynomial of degree $k$ is not uniquely determined by its values at $k$ points. We can construct a non-zero polynomial $p(x) \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$ that has its roots at precisely the $k$ quadrature points, e.g., $p(x) = c \\prod_{j=1}^k (x - \\xi_j)$ for some non-zero constant $c$. For this $w_h = p(x)$, the computed stabilization term is $I_F^{2k-1}(\\tau (w_h)^2) = 0$. However, the true integral is $\\int_F \\tau (w_h)^2 \\, dF > 0$.\n\nTherefore, underintegration with a rule exact to degree $2k-1$ allows for non-zero functions in the kernel of the discrete stabilization term, which breaks coercivity and can render the global linear system singular.\n\nTo rule out this failure mode, the quadrature rule must guarantee that $I_F(\\tau (w_h)^2) > 0$ for all non-zero $w_h \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$. This can be ensured if the quadrature rule integrates the term $\\tau (w_h)^2$ exactly. Since $w_h \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$, the integrand $\\tau(w_h)^2$ is a polynomial of degree at most $2k$. Consequently, the polynomial degree threshold on $m_F(k)$ to rule out this failure mode is $m_F(k) = 2k$. This confirms our finding from the first part.\n\nThe final answer combines the results for $m_V(k)$ and $m_F(k)$ based on the requirement of exact integration.\n$m_V(k) = 2k$\n$m_F(k) = 2k$",
