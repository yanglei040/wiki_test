            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the two-stage, second-order Heun method in the context of strong stability preserving (SSP) time integration. We will proceed by addressing each of the four requested tasks in order.\n\nThe numerical scheme is given by:\n$$\nu^{(1)} = u^{n} + \\Delta t\\, \\mathcal{L}(u^{n})\n$$\n$$\nu^{n+1} = u^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\Big(\\mathcal{L}(u^{n}) + \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})\\Big)\n$$\n\nThe semi-discrete system is $u^{\\prime}(t) = \\mathcal{L}(u(t))$, and the Forward Euler method, $u^{n+1} = u^n + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n)$, is assumed to be monotone for time steps $\\Delta t \\le \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Stability Polynomial $p(z)$**\n\nTo find the stability polynomial, we apply the method to the linear test equation $y^{\\prime} = \\lambda y$, where $\\lambda$ is a complex constant. In this context, the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ corresponds to multiplication by $\\lambda$, so $\\mathcal{L}(y) = \\lambda y$. We define $z = \\Delta t \\lambda$.\n\nFirst, we compute the intermediate stage $y^{(1)}$:\n$$\ny^{(1)} = y^{n} + \\Delta t (\\lambda y^{n}) = (1 + \\Delta t \\lambda) y^{n} = (1 + z) y^{n}\n$$\nNext, we compute the update to the next time level, $y^{n+1}$:\n$$\ny^{n+1} = y^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\Big(\\mathcal{L}(y^{n}) + \\mathcal{L}(y^{(1)})\\Big) = y^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\Big(\\lambda y^{n} + \\lambda y^{(1)}\\Big)\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $y^{(1)}$:\n$$\ny^{n+1} = y^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\Big(\\lambda y^{n} + \\lambda (1 + z) y^{n}\\Big)\n$$\nFactor out $y^n$ from the right-hand side:\n$$\ny^{n+1} = \\left[ 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t \\lambda}{2}\\Big(1 + (1 + z)\\Big) \\right] y^{n} = \\left[ 1 + \\frac{z}{2}(2 + z) \\right] y^{n}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression in the brackets gives the stability polynomial $p(z)$:\n$$\ny^{n+1} = \\left[ 1 + z + \\frac{z^2}{2} \\right] y^{n}\n$$\nThus, the stability polynomial is $p(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{1}{2}z^2$. This is the second-order Taylor series expansion of $\\exp(z)$, as expected for a second-order Runge-Kutta method.\n\n**2. Determination of the Radius of Absolute Monotonicity $R$**\n\nAn explicit Runge-Kutta method with stability polynomial $p(z)$ is defined as absolutely monotone on the interval $[-R, 0]$ if all its derivatives are non-negative for all $z \\in [-R, 0]$. That is, we must have $p^{(k)}(z) \\ge 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 0$ and for all $z \\in [-R, 0]$.\n\nWe compute the derivatives of $p(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{1}{2}z^2$:\n- $p^{(0)}(z) = p(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{1}{2}z^2$\n- $p^{(1)}(z) = p'(z) = 1 + z$\n- $p^{(2)}(z) = p''(z) = 1$\n- $p^{(k)}(z) = 0$ for $k \\ge 3$\n\nNow we check the non-negativity condition for each derivative on the interval $z \\in [-R, 0]$:\n- For $k \\ge 2$, the derivatives $1$ and $0$ are always non-negative, so these impose no restriction on $R$.\n- For $p(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{1}{2}z^2$: This is an upward-opening parabola. Its vertex (minimum) occurs where $p'(z) = 0$, which is at $z=-1$. The minimum value is $p(-1) = 1 - 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(-1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the minimum value is positive, $p(z) > 0$ for all real $z$. This condition imposes no restriction on $R$.\n- For $p'(z) = 1 + z$: We require $1 + z \\ge 0$ for all $z \\in [-R, 0]$. The most restrictive point in this interval is $z = -R$. The condition becomes $1 + (-R) \\ge 0$, which simplifies to $R \\le 1$.\n\nTo satisfy all conditions simultaneously, we must have $R \\le 1$. The radius of absolute monotonicity $R$ is the largest such value, so $R=1$.\n\n**3. Shu–Osher Form and SSP Coefficient $C$**\n\nA method is Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) if it can be expressed as a convex combination of forward Euler steps. The goal is to rewrite the Heun scheme in the Shu-Osher form:\n$u^{(0)} = u^{n}$\n$u^{(i)} = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \\left( \\alpha_{ij} u^{(j)} + \\Delta t \\beta_{ij} \\mathcal{L}(u^{(j)}) \\right)$, with $\\alpha_{ij} \\ge 0, \\beta_{ij} \\ge 0$.\nThe method is SSP if $\\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \\alpha_{ij} = 1$ for each stage $i$. The SSP coefficient $C$ is then given by $C = \\min_{i,j, \\beta_{ij}>0} \\frac{\\alpha_{ij}}{\\beta_{ij}}$.\n\nLet's manipulate the given scheme. We define $u^{(0)}=u^n$. The first stage is a forward Euler step:\n$u^{(1)} = u^n + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n) = u^{(0)} + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(0)})$.\nThis matches the Shu-Osher form for $i=1$ with $\\alpha_{10}=1$ and $\\beta_{10}=1$.\n\nNow we rewrite the final stage, $u^{n+1}$, which we label $u^{(2)}$:\n$u^{n+1} = u^n + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nWe can strategically rewrite this as:\n$u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u^n + \\frac{1}{2}u^n + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nGroup terms:\n$u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u^n + \\frac{1}{2}(u^n + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n)) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nSubstitute $u^{(0)}=u^n$ and $u^{(1)} = u^n + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n)$:\n$u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u^{(0)} + \\frac{1}{2}u^{(1)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nWe can group the terms related to $u^{(1)}$:\n$u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u^{(0)} + \\frac{1}{2}(u^{(1)} + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)}))$\n\nThis expression is a convex combination of $u^{(0)}$ and a forward Euler step applied to $u^{(1)}$. The complete Shu-Osher representation is:\n$u^{(0)} = u^n$\n$u^{(1)} = 1 \\cdot u^{(0)} + \\Delta t \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(u^{(0)})$\n$u^{(2)} = u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} u^{(0)} + \\frac{1}{2} u^{(1)} + \\Delta t \\cdot 0 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(u^{(0)}) + \\Delta t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nThe coefficients are:\n- For stage $i=1$: $\\alpha_{10}=1, \\beta_{10}=1$.\n- For stage $i=2$: $\\alpha_{20}=1/2, \\alpha_{21}=1/2$, so $\\sum \\alpha_{2j} = 1$. And $\\beta_{20}=0, \\beta_{21}=1/2$.\nAll coefficients $\\alpha_{ij}, \\beta_{ij}$ are non-negative.\nThe SSP coefficient is the minimum of the ratios $\\alpha_{ij}/\\beta_{ij}$ where $\\beta_{ij}>0$:\n$C = \\min\\left( \\frac{\\alpha_{10}}{\\beta_{10}}, \\frac{\\alpha_{21}}{\\beta_{21}} \\right) = \\min\\left( \\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1/2}{1/2} \\right) = \\min(1, 1) = 1$.\nThe SSP coefficient is $C=1$. Monotonicity is guaranteed for $\\Delta t \\le 1 \\cdot \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$.\n\n**4. Comparison and Justification of $R$ and $C$**\n\nWe found that the radius of absolute monotonicity is $R=1$ and the SSP coefficient is $C=1$. Thus, for this method, $R=C$.\n\nThis equality is not a coincidence; it is a fundamental result in the theory of SSP methods. The justification relies on the connection between the Shu-Osher representation and the properties of the stability polynomial.\nA method is SSP with coefficient $C$ if it has a Shu-Osher representation where all coefficients $\\alpha_{ij}, \\beta_{ij}$ are non-negative and satisfy $\\alpha_{ij} \\ge C\\beta_{ij}$.\nLet's show that this implies absolute monotonicity on $[-C, 0]$.\nThe stability polynomials for each stage, $p_i(z)$, follow the recursion:\n$p_i(z) = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (\\alpha_{ij} + z\\beta_{ij}) p_j(z)$, with $p_0(z)=1$.\nGiven the SSP condition $\\alpha_{ij} \\ge C\\beta_{ij}$, we can write $\\alpha_{ij} = C\\beta_{ij} + \\gamma_{ij}$ where $\\gamma_{ij} \\ge 0$.\nThe recursion becomes $p_i(z) = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} [\\beta_{ij}(C+z) + \\gamma_{ij}] p_j(z)$.\nWe can prove by induction on the stage index $i$ that $p_i^{(k)}(z) \\ge 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$ and $z \\in [-C, 0]$.\n- Base case ($i=0$): $p_0(z)=1$. All its derivatives are non-negative.\n- Inductive step: Assume $p_j^{(k)}(z) \\ge 0$ on $[-C, 0]$ for all $j < i$ and all $k \\ge 0$.\nThen for $p_i(z)$, we have a sum of terms $[\\beta_{ij}(C+z) + \\gamma_{ij}] p_j(z)$. On $[-C, 0]$, we have $C+z \\ge 0$. Since $\\beta_{ij}, \\gamma_{ij} \\ge 0$ and by the inductive hypothesis $p_j(z) \\ge 0$, it follows that $p_i(z) \\ge 0$.\nBy applying the product rule for differentiation to the recursive formula, every derivative $p_i^{(k)}(z)$ will be a sum of non-negative terms on $[-C, 0]$. For example, $p_i'(z) = \\sum [\\beta_{ij}p_j(z) + (\\beta_{ij}(C+z) + \\gamma_{ij})p_j'(z)]$, which is a sum of non-negative quantities.\nThis establishes that if a method is SSP with coefficient $C$, it must be absolutely monotone on $[-C, 0]$. By definition of the radius of absolute monotonicity $R$, this implies $R \\ge C$.\n\nFor optimal SSP methods, like the one considered here, the SSP coefficient is maximized, leading to the equality $R=C$. Our independent calculations from first principles ($R=1$ from the derivatives of $p(z)$, and $C=1$ from the Shu-Osher form) confirm this equality for the Heun method.",

Identify the binding stage(s) based on the provided definition: \"the stage(s) for which the Forward Euler scaling factor equals the minimal value across all Forward Euler substeps\".\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the theory of numerical methods for differential equations, specifically strong stability preserving time integration schemes. The definitions and the provided Butcher tableau are standard in this field. Tasks 1 and 2 are well-posed and represent a standard derivation.\n\nHowever, Task 3 contains a critical ambiguity in its definition of a \"binding constraint\". A literal interpretation leads to a scientific contradiction. The stability of an SSP method relies on ensuring that for each substep of the form $u' = u + \\gamma \\Delta t L(u)$, the effective time step $\\gamma \\Delta t$ does not exceed $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$. The constraint on the global time step $\\Delta t$ is therefore $\\Delta t \\le \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}} / \\gamma$. The \"binding\" constraint—the one that most restricts $\\Delta t$—arises from the substep with the *maximal* scaling factor $\\gamma$, not the minimal one. A minimal scaling factor (e.g., $\\gamma=0$) provides the weakest constraint (or no constraint at all), and thus cannot be \"binding\".\n\nThe problem's definition—\"minimal value across all Forward Euler substeps\"—points to the non-binding substeps. This is a flaw that violates **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness** (1) and renders the task **Ill-Posed** (5).\n\nHowever, the problem can be rendered solvable under a reasonable interpretation. The term \"Forward Euler substeps\" can be interpreted as excluding the trivial cases where the scaling factor $\\gamma$ is zero, as these are not true \"steps\". Under this interpretation, we would consider the minimal value across all *positive* scaling factors. For the specific SSPRK(3,3) method, all positive scaling factors happen to be equal, making the \"minimal positive\" and \"maximal\" values coincide. We proceed by adopting this interpretation, noting the flaw in the problem statement.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** under the specific, necessary interpretation of the third task. We will now proceed to the full solution.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe general form of an explicit $s$-stage Runge-Kutta method for $u' = L(u)$ is given by:\n$$\nk_i = L\\left(u^n + \\Delta t \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij} k_j\\right), \\quad i=1, \\dots, s\n$$\n$$\nu^{n+1} = u^n + \\Delta t \\sum_{i=1}^{s} b_i k_i\n$$\nFrom the given Butcher tableau for SSPRK(3,3), we have $s=3$ with coefficients $a_{21}=1$, $a_{31}=1/4$, $a_{32}=1/4$, and $b_1=1/6$, $b_2=1/6$, $b_3=2/3$. All other $a_{ij}$ with $j \\ge i$ are zero.\n\nLet $u^{(0)} = u^n$ be the solution at the beginning of the time step.\n\n### Task 1: Derive the Shu–Osher Form\n\nThe Shu-Osher representation expresses each intermediate stage of the RK method as a convex combination of previous stage values updated by Forward Euler-like steps. We define the intermediate stages $u^{(i)}$ as the arguments of the function $L$.\n\n**Stage 1:**\nThe first stage vector is $k_1 = L(u^n) = L(u^{(0)})$.\nThe first intermediate stage value, used to compute $k_2$, is:\n$$\nu^{(1)} = u^n + \\Delta t \\, a_{21} k_1 = u^n + \\Delta t \\, L(u^n)\n$$\nRewriting this in terms of $u^{(0)}$:\n$$\nu^{(1)} = u^{(0)} + \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(0)})\n$$\nThis is already in the form of a Forward Euler step. We can write this as a (trivial) convex combination:\n$$\nu^{(1)} = 1 \\cdot (u^{(0)} + 1 \\cdot \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(0)}))\n$$\nThe convex coefficient is $1$, and the Forward Euler scaling factor is $\\gamma=1$.\n\n**Stage 2:**\nThe second stage vector is $k_2 = L(u^{(1)})$. The second intermediate stage value, used to compute $k_3$, is:\n$$\nu^{(2)} = u^n + \\Delta t \\, (a_{31} k_1 + a_{32} k_2) = u^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{4} L(u^n) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{4} L(u^{(1)})\n$$\nTo express this in the Shu-Osher form, we must write it as a convex combination of FE steps from previous stages ($u^{(0)}$ and $u^{(1)}$). From the definition of $u^{(1)}$, we have $\\Delta t \\, L(u^n) = u^{(1)} - u^n$. Substituting this:\n$$\nu^{(2)} = u^n + \\frac{1}{4}(u^{(1)} - u^n) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{4} L(u^{(1)})\n$$\n$$\nu^{(2)} = \\frac{3}{4}u^n + \\frac{1}{4}u^{(1)} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{4} L(u^{(1)})\n$$\nGrouping terms and using $u^{(0)}=u^n$:\n$$\nu^{(2)} = \\frac{3}{4}u^{(0)} + \\frac{1}{4}(u^{(1)} + \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(1)}))\n$$\nThis is a convex combination. The coefficients are $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$, which are non-negative and sum to $1$. The terms are:\n- A step from $u^{(0)}$: We can write $\\frac{3}{4}u^{(0)}$ as $\\frac{3}{4}(u^{(0)} + 0 \\cdot \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(0)}))$. The scaling factor is $\\gamma=0$.\n- A step from $u^{(1)}$: $\\frac{1}{4}(u^{(1)} + 1 \\cdot \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(1)}))$. The scaling factor is $\\gamma=1$.\n\n**Stage 3 (Final Update):**\nThe final solution is $u^{n+1}$. Let's denote it by $u^{(3)}$ for consistency. The stage vector $k_3$ is $L(u^{(2)})$.\n$$\nu^{(3)} = u^{n+1} = u^n + \\Delta t (b_1 k_1 + b_2 k_2 + b_3 k_3)\n$$\n$$\nu^{(3)} = u^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6} L(u^n) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6} L(u^{(1)}) + \\frac{2\\Delta t}{3} L(u^{(2)})\n$$\nWe use the relations derived previously: $\\Delta t \\, L(u^n) = u^{(1)} - u^n$ and $\\Delta t \\, L(u^{(1)}) = 4u^{(2)} - 3u^n - u^{(1)}$. Substituting these:\n$$\nu^{(3)} = u^n + \\frac{1}{6}(u^{(1)} - u^n) + \\frac{1}{6}(4u^{(2)} - 3u^n - u^{(1)}) + \\frac{2\\Delta t}{3} L(u^{(2)})\n$$\nCollecting coefficients for $u^n$, $u^{(1)}$, and $u^{(2)}$:\n- Coefficient of $u^n$: $1 - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{6-1-3}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- Coefficient of $u^{(1)}$: $\\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = 0$.\n- Coefficient of $u^{(2)}$: $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe expression simplifies to:\n$$\nu^{(3)} = \\frac{1}{3}u^n + \\frac{2}{3}u^{(2)} + \\frac{2\\Delta t}{3} L(u^{(2)})\n$$\nGrouping terms and using $u^{(0)}=u^n$:\n$$\nu^{(3)} = \\frac{1}{3}u^{(0)} + \\frac{2}{3}(u^{(2)} + \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(2)}))\n$$\nThis is a convex combination. The coefficients are $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The terms are:\n- A step from $u^{(0)}$: $\\frac{1}{3}(u^{(0)} + 0 \\cdot \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(0)}))$. The scaling factor is $\\gamma=0$.\n- A step from $u^{(2)}$: $\\frac{2}{3}(u^{(2)} + 1 \\cdot \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(2)}))$. The scaling factor is $\\gamma=1$.\n\n### Task 2: Determine the SSP Coefficient $C$\n\nThe method is monotone if for every substep of the form $u' = u + \\gamma \\Delta t L(u)$, the condition $\\gamma \\Delta t \\le \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$ is met. This must hold for all non-zero scaling factors $\\gamma$ in the Shu-Osher representation. This implies $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$ for all $\\gamma > 0$. The SSP coefficient $C$ is the largest value such that the method is monotone for $\\Delta t \\le C \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$. Thus,\n$$\nC = \\min_{\\gamma > 0} \\frac{1}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{\\max(\\gamma)}\n$$\nFrom the Shu-Osher form derived above, the set of all Forward Euler scaling factors is $\\{1, 0, 1, 0, 1\\}$. The non-zero scaling factors are all equal to $1$.\nThe maximum scaling factor is $\\max(\\gamma) = 1$.\nTherefore, the SSP coefficient is:\n$$\nC = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n$$\n\n### Task 3: Identify the Binding Stage(s)\nAs established during validation, we interpret \"all Forward Euler substeps\" to mean those with a non-zero scaling factor, $\\gamma > 0$. The problem asks for the stage(s) where the scaling factor $\\gamma$ equals the minimal value across this set of substeps.\nThe set of positive scaling factors is $\\{1, 1, 1\\}$.\nThe minimal value in this set is $1$.\nWe now identify the stages in which a substep with $\\gamma=1$ appears:\n- **Stage 1**: The creation of $u^{(1)}$ involves the substep $u^{(0)} + 1 \\cdot \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(0)})$. The scaling factor is $1$. This is a binding stage.\n- **Stage 2**: The creation of $u^{(2)}$ involves the substep $u^{(1)} + 1 \\cdot \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(1)})$. The scaling factor is $1$. This is a binding stage.\n- **Stage 3**: The creation of $u^{(3)}$ involves the substep $u^{(2)} + 1 \\cdot \\Delta t \\, L(u^{(2)})$. The scaling factor is $1$.

This final practice bridges theory and application by demonstrating how to derive this crucial parameter from a concrete linear system arising from a spatial discretization. By analyzing the matrices generated by a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, you will see precisely how the properties of the spatial operator dictate the stability limit for the time integration .",

The Gershgorin disc theorem and the FE absolute stability region.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is set in the context of numerical analysis for partial differential equations, specifically Discontinuous Galerkin methods and Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) time integrators. The matrices $M$ and $K$, the concept of $\\ell_{1}$-norm monotonicity, the matrix measure, and the Gershgorin disc theorem are all standard and well-established concepts in mathematics and scientific computing. The mass matrix entries $M_{ii} = \\frac{2}{2(i-1)+1}$ correspond to the inner products of scaled Legendre polynomials, which is consistent with the problem description.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data ($M$ and $K$) and definitions to calculate the system matrix $A$ and derive the time-step restriction. The objective is clearly stated, and a unique numerical answer is expected.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, mathematical language, free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The mass matrix $M$ is diagonal and positive definite, thus it is invertible, ensuring that the system matrix $A$ is well-defined. There are no contradictions in the provided information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the largest step-size $\\Delta t = \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}} > 0$ such that the forward Euler update is contractive in the $\\ell_{1}$ norm. The update is given by $u^{n+1} = u^{n} + \\Delta t \\, A \\, u^{n} = (I + \\Delta t A) u^{n}$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix.\n\nThe condition for $\\ell_{1}$-contractivity is that the induced $\\ell_{1}$-norm of the amplification matrix $(I + \\Delta t A)$ is less than or equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\|I + \\Delta t A\\|_{\\ell_{1}} \\le 1\n$$\nThe induced $\\ell_{1}$-norm of a matrix $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ is defined as the maximum absolute column sum:\n$$\n\\|B\\|_{\\ell_{1}} = \\max_{1 \\le j \\le m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |b_{ij}|\n$$\nApplying this to the matrix $B = I + \\Delta t A$, its elements are $b_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} + \\Delta t a_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The condition becomes:\n$$\n\\max_{j} \\left( |1 + \\Delta t a_{jj}| + \\sum_{i \\neq j} |\\Delta t a_{ij}| \\right) \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for each column $j$. Thus, for all $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$\n|1 + \\Delta t a_{jj}| + \\Delta t \\sum_{i \\neq j} |a_{ij}| \\le 1\n$$\n\nFirst, we must compute the system matrix $A = M^{-1} K$.\nThe mass matrix is $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2}{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{2}{5} \\end{pmatrix}$. Its inverse is $M^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{3}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{5}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nNow, we compute $A$:\n$$\nA = M^{-1} K = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{3}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{5}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -6 & 6 & 0 \\\\ 2 & -\\frac{16}{3} & \\frac{10}{3} \\\\ 0 & 2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n(\\frac{1}{2})(-6) & (\\frac{1}{2})(6) & (\\frac{1}{2})(0) \\\\\n(\\frac{3}{2})(2) & (\\frac{3}{2})(-\\frac{16}{3}) & (\\frac{3}{2})(\\frac{10}{3}) \\\\\n(\\frac{5}{2})(0) & (\\frac{5}{2})(2) & (\\frac{5}{2})(-2)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n-3 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n3 & -8 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 5 & -5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we apply the $\\ell_{1}$-contractivity condition for each column of $A$.\n\nFor column $j = 1$: $a_{11} = -3$, $\\sum_{i \\neq 1} |a_{i1}| = |3| + |0| = 3$.\nThe condition is $|1 - 3 \\Delta t| + 3 \\Delta t \\le 1$.\nIf $\\Delta t > 1/3$, then $1 - 3 \\Delta t < 0$, so $|1 - 3 \\Delta t| = 3 \\Delta t - 1$. The inequality becomes $(3 \\Delta t - 1) + 3 \\Delta t = 6 \\Delta t - 1 \\le 1$, which means $6 \\Delta t \\le 2$, or $\\Delta t \\le 1/3$. This contradicts the assumption $\\Delta t > 1/3$.\nTherefore, we must have $\\Delta t \\le 1/3$. In this case, $1 - 3 \\Delta t \\ge 0$, and the inequality becomes $(1 - 3 \\Delta t) + 3 \\Delta t = 1 \\le 1$, which is always true.\nThus, the constraint from the first column is $\\Delta t \\le 1/3$.\n\nFor column $j = 2$: $a_{22} = -8$, $\\sum_{i \\neq 2} |a_{i2}| = |3| + |5| = 8$.\nThe condition is $|1 - 8 \\Delta t| + 8 \\Delta t \\le 1$.\nSimilarly, if we assume $\\Delta t > 1/8$, the inequality becomes $(8 \\Delta t - 1) + 8 \\Delta t = 16 \\Delta t - 1 \\le 1$, which implies $16 \\Delta t \\le 2$, or $\\Delta t \\le 1/8$. This is a contradiction.\nSo we must have $\\Delta t \\le 1/8$. For such $\\Delta t$, the inequality becomes $(1 - 8 \\Delta t) + 8 \\Delta t = 1 \\le 1$, which is always true.\nThe constraint from the second column is $\\Delta t \\le 1/8$.\n\nFor column $j = 3$: $a_{33} = -5$, $\\sum_{i \\neq 3} |a_{i3}| = |0| + |5| = 5$.\nThe condition is $|1 - 5 \\Delta t| + 5 \\Delta t \\le 1$.\nSimilarly, an assumption of $\\Delta t > 1/5$ leads to a contradiction ($10 \\Delta t \\le 2 \\implies \\Delta t \\le 1/5$).\nSo we must have $\\Delta t \\le 1/5$. For such $\\Delta t$, the inequality becomes $(1 - 5 \\Delta t) + 5 \\Delta t = 1 \\le 1$, which is always true.\nThe constraint from the third column is $\\Delta t \\le 1/5$.\n\nTo satisfy the condition for all columns simultaneously, the time step $\\Delta t$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of the individual upper bounds:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\min \\left( \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{5} \\right)\n$$\nThe minimum of these values is $1/8$.\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nThe largest possible step-size $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$ for which the forward Euler method is monotone in the $\\ell_1$-norm is therefore $1/8$. The numerical value is $0.125$. As an exact fraction, no rounding is necessary.",
