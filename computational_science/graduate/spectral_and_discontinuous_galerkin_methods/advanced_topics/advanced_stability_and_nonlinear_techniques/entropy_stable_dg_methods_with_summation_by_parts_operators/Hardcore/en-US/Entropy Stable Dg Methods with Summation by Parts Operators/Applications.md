## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles and mechanisms of entropy-stable Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods built upon Summation-By-Parts (SBP) operators. We have seen that these methods provide a systematic framework for constructing high-order, non-dissipative, and robust [numerical schemes](@entry_id:752822) for conservation laws. However, a theoretical construct is only as valuable as its ability to address complex, real-world problems. This chapter transitions from the abstract principles to the concrete applications, demonstrating the utility, versatility, and profound interdisciplinary reach of this numerical framework.

Our exploration will not revisit the foundational concepts but will instead focus on how they are utilized and extended in diverse and challenging contexts. We will see how the algebraic structure of SBP operators facilitates the handling of complex geometries and physical boundaries, how the property of [entropy stability](@entry_id:749023) can be preserved under advanced computational strategies, and how the entire framework can be rigorously verified. Furthermore, we will venture beyond traditional computational fluid dynamics to explore applications in other scientific domains and connect the numerical properties of our schemes to the deep mathematical theory of convergence for [partial differential equations](@entry_id:143134).

### Foundational Applications in Computational Physics and Engineering

To be of practical use in science and engineering, a numerical method must be able to handle the complexities of physical reality. This includes simulating phenomena on non-trivial geometric domains and correctly incorporating the exchange of information with the outside world through physical boundaries. Entropy-stable SBP-DG methods offer elegant and robust solutions to these foundational challenges.

#### Handling Complex Geometries: Free-Stream Preservation

Most problems of practical interest, from the flow over an aircraft wing to atmospheric weather patterns, are defined on domains with curved boundaries. A standard approach for handling such complex geometries is to perform computations on a simple reference element (e.g., a cube) and map it to the curved physical element. This transformation, however, introduces geometric factors—the Jacobian of the mapping $J$ and associated metric terms—into the governing equations. A critical test of a numerical scheme's reliability on such [curvilinear grids](@entry_id:748121) is its ability to preserve a "free-stream" or constant state exactly. Failure to do so can introduce spurious [numerical errors](@entry_id:635587) that corrupt the solution, especially in long-time simulations.

Achieving free-stream preservation is not trivial; it requires the discrete operators to satisfy a discrete analogue of a fundamental geometric identity known as the Piola identity. In its continuous form, this identity states that the divergence of the [cofactor](@entry_id:200224) of the [deformation gradient tensor](@entry_id:150370) is zero. For a mapping from reference coordinates $\vec{\xi} = (\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3)$ to physical coordinates $\vec{x}$, this translates to a condition on the contravariant basis vectors $\vec{a}^k$. Discretely, using SBP derivative operators $D_k$ in each coordinate direction, this condition becomes the set of *[discrete metric](@entry_id:154658) identities*:
$$
D_1\left(J \vec{a}^1\right) + D_2\left(J \vec{a}^2\right) + D_3\left(J \vec{a}^3\right) = \vec{0}
$$
where $J \vec{a}^k$ are the metric terms evaluated at the grid nodes. By carefully constructing the discrete geometric factors to be consistent with the SBP operators, it is possible to satisfy these identities. This ensures that when a constant state is used as input, the discrete [divergence operator](@entry_id:265975) yields exactly zero, thus preserving the free-stream. This property is a cornerstone of robust SBP-DG methods for engineering applications . Moreover, the fact that these conditions are purely algebraic allows for their formal, machine-assisted verification, a concept we will revisit later in this chapter .

#### Imposing Physical Boundary Conditions

Simulations are not performed in a vacuum; they interact with their surroundings through boundaries. The imposition of boundary conditions must be done in a way that is both physically accurate and numerically stable. SBP-DG methods achieve this through the use of Simultaneous Approximation Terms (SATs), which weakly enforce boundary data via penalty terms. The crucial challenge is designing these penalty terms so that they do not violate the scheme's [entropy stability](@entry_id:749023).

The core principle can be illustrated with the simple [scalar advection equation](@entry_id:754529), $u_t + a u_x = 0$, with an inflow Dirichlet condition. By applying the [energy method](@entry_id:175874) (multiplying the semi-discrete equation by the solution vector and integrating using the SBP norm), one can analyze the rate of change of the total discrete entropy. The SBP property perfectly cancels the interior contributions, leaving only the boundary and SAT terms. The goal is to choose the SAT [penalty parameter](@entry_id:753318), $\tau$, such that the contribution from the boundary mimics the physical process: entropy can be advected into the domain but is not spuriously generated at the boundary. This analysis reveals that the penalty parameter must be directly related to the physics of the problem, with the choice $\tau = -a$ for inflow ensuring that the boundary term is non-positive, thereby guaranteeing that the total entropy does not increase due to the boundary condition .

For a system of equations, such as the compressible Euler equations, the situation is more intricate and physically rich. The correct number and type of boundary conditions depend on the [physics of information](@entry_id:275933) propagation, which is described by characteristic waves. The eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian, $A_n$, determine the speeds and directions of these waves. An eigenvalue $\lambda_i  0$ for an outward normal $n$ corresponds to an *incoming* characteristic, which carries information into the domain, while $\lambda_i > 0$ corresponds to an *outgoing* characteristic, which carries information out. For a boundary condition to be well-posed and entropy-stable, one must provide data for the incoming modes while allowing the outgoing modes to be determined by the solution from the interior.

For example, in a one-dimensional subsonic flow ($0  M  1$) moving from left to right, analysis of the Euler eigenvalues reveals that the left (inflow) boundary has two incoming characteristics, while the right (outflow) boundary has one. An entropy-stable SAT formulation must respect this physical reality. The penalty matrices in the SATs are designed to act only on the subspace spanned by the incoming [characteristic variables](@entry_id:747282), prescribing data for them (e.g., total pressure and total temperature at inflow) while leaving the outgoing modes unconstrained. This ensures that the boundary treatment is not only stable but also physically consistent .

#### Analysis of Numerical Wave Propagation

Beyond stability, a primary goal of numerical simulation is accuracy. A good numerical scheme must accurately represent the behavior of physical phenomena, such as wave propagation. The Euler equations, for instance, support different types of waves, including acoustic waves and a passive "entropy mode" corresponding to variations in density or temperature that are simply advected with the mean flow. Analyzing how a numerical scheme affects this simple entropy mode provides a clear window into its fundamental accuracy properties.

By linearizing the Euler equations around a uniform base state, the entropy mode can be isolated and shown to obey a simple [scalar advection equation](@entry_id:754529). We can then apply Fourier analysis to the SBP-DG discretization of this equation. By substituting a plane wave ansatz into the semi-discrete scheme, we can derive the scheme's Fourier symbol, a complex number $\lambda(\theta)$ whose real and imaginary parts dictate the fate of a wave with dimensionless wavenumber $\theta$.

The analysis yields two critical quantities:
-   **Numerical Phase Speed**: Derived from $\mathrm{Im}(\lambda)$, this measures the speed at which numerical waves travel. For an ideal scheme, it would be constant and equal to the physical [wave speed](@entry_id:186208). For the SBP-DG scheme, the numerical phase speed is found to be of the form $c_{\text{num}}(\theta) = a \frac{\sin\theta}{\theta}$, revealing a *dispersive error*—different wavelengths travel at slightly different speeds.
-   **Numerical Dissipation Rate**: Derived from $-\mathrm{Re}(\lambda)$, this measures the rate at which wave amplitudes are damped by the scheme. This quantity is directly controlled by the choice of numerical flux at element interfaces. For a common family of fluxes parameterized by $\beta \in [0,1]$ (ranging from central to upwind), the [dissipation rate](@entry_id:748577) is $\sigma(\theta) = \frac{a\beta}{h}(1-\cos\theta)$.

This analysis demonstrates that the dispersive error is an inherent property of the [spatial discretization](@entry_id:172158), while the numerical dissipation can be explicitly controlled by the user through the choice of flux. This provides a powerful quantitative tool for designing and tuning [numerical schemes](@entry_id:752822) to achieve a desired balance between damping spurious oscillations and preserving the amplitude of physical waves .

### Advanced Computational Strategies and Verification

As simulations grow in complexity and scale, raw computational efficiency and the trustworthiness of the code become paramount. The algebraic and conservative nature of the SBP-DG framework provides a fertile ground for developing advanced, efficient algorithms and rigorous verification procedures that maintain the foundational property of [entropy stability](@entry_id:749023).

#### Enhancing Computational Efficiency: Multi-Rate Time Integration

Many physical problems exhibit multi-scale behavior, where different phenomena evolve on vastly different time scales. For instance, in a [combustion simulation](@entry_id:155787), chemical reactions may occur on a microsecond scale while the bulk [fluid motion](@entry_id:182721) evolves over milliseconds. A standard, [explicit time-stepping](@entry_id:168157) scheme is limited by the smallest, fastest time scale in the entire domain, making such simulations prohibitively expensive. Multi-rate [time-stepping methods](@entry_id:167527) address this by using smaller time steps in regions with fast dynamics (the "fine" level) and larger time steps in regions with slow dynamics (the "coarse" level).

A crucial question is whether such a complex time-stepping strategy can be implemented without destroying the carefully constructed [entropy stability](@entry_id:749023) of the [spatial discretization](@entry_id:172158). The answer is yes, provided the coupling at the interface between the coarse and fine levels is handled correctly. By using SBP-compatible projection and restriction operators to transfer information between grids, one can ensure that the coupling itself is energy-stable. When combined with Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) [time integrators](@entry_id:756005), it is possible to derive a condition on the *[subcycling](@entry_id:755594) ratio* $r = \Delta t_{\text{coarse}} / \Delta t_{\text{fine}}$ that guarantees the [entropy stability](@entry_id:749023) of the global, multi-rate scheme. The maximum allowable ratio $r_{\max}$ is a function of the stability limits of the spatial operators on each level ($\lambda_f, \sigma_f, \lambda_c, \sigma_c$) and the SSP coefficients of the chosen [time integrators](@entry_id:756005) ($C_f, C_c$):
$$
r_{\max} = \frac{C_{c} (\lambda_{f} + \sigma_{f})}{C_{f} (\lambda_{c} + \sigma_{c})}
$$
This result demonstrates that significant computational savings can be achieved with multi-rate methods without sacrificing the mathematical rigor and robustness endowed by the entropy-stable framework .

#### Rigorous Verification and Code Certification

Modern simulation codes are extraordinarily complex pieces of software, and verifying their correctness is a formidable challenge. A subtle bug in the implementation of a numerical operator can lead to silently incorrect results. One of the most elegant and powerful features of the SBP framework is that its core properties are defined by a set of algebraic identities. This makes them amenable to *machine verification*.

Rather than relying solely on visual inspection of simulation results, a developer can write a simple verification script to check, to machine precision, that their implementation satisfies the fundamental mathematical contracts of the method. These checks include:
1.  The discrete integration-by-parts formula: $Q + Q^\top = B$.
2.  Tadmor's entropy-conservative flux relation, which ensures the flux exactly conserves entropy.
3.  The entropy-stable inequality for the chosen [numerical flux](@entry_id:145174), which ensures dissipation is added correctly.
4.  The final semi-[discrete entropy inequality](@entry_id:748505) for a complete element, incorporating the effects of both the SBP derivative and the SAT boundary penalties, even on [curved elements](@entry_id:748117).

Because these are algebraic statements about matrices and vectors, they can be tested automatically, much like a "unit test" in software engineering. Passing these checks provides a very high degree of confidence that the mathematical core of the simulation code is implemented correctly. This capacity for [formal verification](@entry_id:149180) sets SBP-based methods apart, offering a level of rigor and trustworthiness that is difficult to achieve with other [discretization](@entry_id:145012) techniques .

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Theoretical Foundations

The framework of entropy-stable methods for conservation laws is not confined to fluid dynamics. Its mathematical structure is general and finds applications in diverse fields. Moreover, the property of [entropy stability](@entry_id:749023) is not merely a numerical convenience; it is the essential link that connects the numerical approximation to the deep mathematical theory of the underlying partial differential equations.

#### Modeling Macroscopic Systems: Traffic Flow Dynamics

A compelling example of the interdisciplinary reach of these methods is the modeling of traffic flow. The Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) model describes the evolution of vehicle density $\rho$ on a road network with a [scalar conservation law](@entry_id:754531), $\partial_t \rho + \partial_x f(\rho) = 0$, where $f(\rho)$ is the vehicle flux. This equation is mathematically analogous to the equations of fluid dynamics and, like them, can develop shocks (traffic jams).

Just as the Euler equations possess a physical entropy, the LWR model can be equipped with a mathematical entropy function. By applying an entropy-stable SBP-DG scheme to the LWR model, one discovers a profound connection: the discrete total entropy of the numerical scheme, $\mathcal{L}(t)$, serves as a *macroscopic Lyapunov function* for the traffic network. In [systems theory](@entry_id:265873), a Lyapunov function is a scalar function of the system's state that is guaranteed to decrease over time, indicating that the system is evolving towards a [stable equilibrium](@entry_id:269479).

In this context, the non-increasing nature of the numerical entropy, which we engineered for [numerical stability](@entry_id:146550), directly mirrors the physical tendency of a traffic network to dissipate congestion and settle into a steady state. The numerical dissipation in the scheme corresponds to the "friction" that smooths out traffic jams. This provides a powerful analytical tool, transforming a [numerical stability](@entry_id:146550) property into a statement about the global, long-term behavior of a complex macroscopic system .

#### The Bridge to Mathematical Theory: Convergence to Entropy Solutions

Perhaps the most significant application of [entropy-stable schemes](@entry_id:749017) lies in the realm of pure mathematical theory. For nonlinear [hyperbolic conservation laws](@entry_id:147752), which can develop discontinuous "shock" solutions, the ultimate question for any numerical method is: does the [numerical approximation](@entry_id:161970) $u_h$ converge to the physically correct solution $u$ as the mesh is refined ($h \to 0$)? This is a highly non-trivial question. The limit of a sequence of approximate solutions must not only be a weak solution to the PDE, but must also satisfy an additional [entropy condition](@entry_id:166346) to rule out unphysical phenomena like expansion shocks.

The Lax–Wendroff theorem provides a partial answer: if the approximations from a conservative, consistent scheme converge strongly, then the limit is indeed a weak solution. The great difficulty lies in proving strong convergence for a nonlinear problem. This is where the structure of [entropy-stable schemes](@entry_id:749017) becomes indispensable. The [discrete entropy inequality](@entry_id:748505) provides a uniform bound on the total amount of entropy dissipated by the scheme over the course of a simulation. This bound is the critical ingredient needed to apply the powerful mathematical theory of *compensated compactness*.

This theory, pioneered by Luc Tartar and François Murat, provides a framework for controlling the oscillations in sequences of approximate solutions. By leveraging the information from an entire family of entropy inequalities, the theory proves that the oscillations are so constrained that they must vanish in the limit. This forces the [weak convergence](@entry_id:146650) of the sequence to become strong convergence. With [strong convergence](@entry_id:139495) established, one can pass to the limit in the weak form of the PDE. The [discrete entropy inequality](@entry_id:748505), in the limit, guarantees that the resulting solution satisfies the true [entropy condition](@entry_id:166346). Thus, the [entropy stability](@entry_id:749023) we build into our schemes for [numerical robustness](@entry_id:188030) is precisely the property that provides the theoretical guarantee of convergence to the correct, physical solution. This forms a beautiful and complete bridge from practical [algorithm design](@entry_id:634229) to the fundamental mathematical foundations of the field .
