            "problem": "Consider a polygonal or polyhedral domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, $d \\ge 1$, equipped with a conforming, shape-regular mesh $\\mathcal{T}_{h}$ of affine elements. Let $\\mathcal{F}_{h}$ denote the set of $(d-1)$-dimensional faces. Assume an isotropic constant diffusion coefficient $\\alpha > 0$. Let $V_{h}$ be the discontinuous Galerkin finite element space of piecewise polynomials of total degree at most $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ on $\\mathcal{T}_{h}$.\n\nOn each interior face $F \\in \\mathcal{F}_{h}$ shared by elements $K^{+}$ and $K^{-}$ with unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ (taken fixed on $F$ and pointing from $K^{+}$ to $K^{-}$), the Symmetric Interior Penalty (SIP) discontinuous Galerkin method for a second-order elliptic problem involves the following face integrals: the penalty term $\\int_{F} \\sigma\\,[u_{h}]\\,[v_{h}] \\,\\mathrm{d}s$ and the consistency terms $-\\int_{F} \\{\\alpha \\nabla u_{h}\\}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\\,[v_{h}]\\,\\mathrm{d}s - \\int_{F} \\{\\alpha \\nabla v_{h}\\}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\\,[u_{h}]\\,\\mathrm{d}s$, where $u_{h}, v_{h} \\in V_{h}$ are test and trial functions, $[\\,\\cdot\\,]$ denotes the jump across $F$, $\\{\\,\\cdot\\,\\}$ denotes the average across $F$, and $\\sigma > 0$ is a constant per-face penalty parameter (possibly depending on $p$ and the local mesh size but independent of the face coordinates). On boundary faces, the analogous terms reduce correspondingly, but you may ignore boundary-specific modifications and focus on the worst-case polynomial degrees arising on interior faces.\n\nAssume that each face integral is evaluated by a quadrature rule on $F$ that is exact for all scalar polynomials on $F$ of total degree at most $q$. The mesh is affine so that element and face Jacobians and face normals are constant on each $F$, and thus do not increase polynomial degrees of the integrands.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of polynomial degree, product degree, traces, jumps, and averages on faces, determine the minimal total-degree exactness $q$ required on faces to guarantee that, for any $u_{h}, v_{h} \\in V_{h}$, both the penalty term and the consistency terms are integrated exactly on every face $F \\in \\mathcal{F}_{h}$, thereby eliminating quadrature aliasing in these face contributions. Justify your choice by identifying the maximal polynomial degree of each integrand on $F$.\n\nExpress your final answer as an exact symbolic expression in terms of $p$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimal total-degree exactness $q$ for a quadrature rule on a face $F$ of the mesh $\\mathcal{T}_h$, such that the face integrals of the Symmetric Interior Penalty (SIP) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method are computed exactly. The problem is set in a domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for $d \\ge 1$ with a constant diffusion coefficient $\\alpha > 0$. The DG finite element space $V_h$ consists of piecewise polynomials of total degree at most $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nLet $u_h, v_h \\in V_h$ be arbitrary functions from the DG space. We must analyze the polynomial degree of the integrands for both the penalty and consistency terms on an interior face $F \\in \\mathcal{F}_h$. Let $F$ be the interface between two elements $K^+$ and $K^-$. Let $\\mathcal{P}_k(S)$ denote the space of polynomials of total degree at most $k$ on a domain $S$.\n\nBy definition of the space $V_h$, the restrictions $u_h|_{K^+}$ and $u_h|_{K^-}$ are polynomials of total degree at most $p$. The mesh $\\mathcal{T}_h$ is composed of affine elements, which means the mapping from a reference element to any element $K \\in \\mathcal{T}_h$ is affine. A key consequence is that the trace of a polynomial of total degree $p$ on an element $K$ onto one of its flat $(d-1)$-dimensional faces $F$ is a polynomial of total degree at most $p$ on $F$. Therefore, the traces of $u_h$ on $F$ from the adjacent elements, denoted as $u_h^+ = u_h|_{K^+}|_F$ and $u_h^- = u_h|_{K^-}|_F$, are both elements of $\\mathcal{P}_p(F)$.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the penalty term: $\\int_{F} \\sigma\\,[u_{h}]\\,[v_{h}] \\,\\mathrm{d}s$.\nThe integrand is $\\sigma\\,[u_{h}]\\,[v_{h}]$. The scalar penalty parameter $\\sigma$ is given as constant on the face $F$. The jump of a scalar function $w_h$ across $F$ is defined as $[w_h] = w_h^+ - w_h^-$.\nSince $u_h^+, u_h^- \\in \\mathcal{P}_p(F)$, their difference $[u_h] = u_h^+ - u_h^-$ is also a polynomial in $\\mathcal{P}_p(F)$. Similarly, for $v_h \\in V_h$, the jump $[v_h]$ belongs to $\\mathcal{P}_p(F)$.\nThe integrand of the penalty term is the product of $[u_h] \\in \\mathcal{P}_p(F)$ and $[v_h] \\in \\mathcal{P}_p(F)$. The product of two polynomials of total degree at most $p$ is a polynomial of total degree at most $p+p=2p$. Therefore, the integrand $\\sigma\\,[u_{h}]\\,[v_{h}]$ is a polynomial on $F$ of total degree at most $2p$. This maximum degree is attainable, for instance, by choosing $u_h$ and $v_h$ whose traces on $F$ are non-zero polynomials of degree $p$.\n\nNext, we analyze the consistency terms: $-\\int_{F} \\{\\alpha \\nabla u_{h}\\}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\\,[v_{h}]\\,\\mathrm{d}s - \\int_{F} \\{\\alpha \\nabla v_{h}\\}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\\,[u_{h}]\\,\\mathrm{d}s$.\nDue to symmetry, it suffices to analyze the integrand of one of these terms, for example, $\\{\\alpha \\nabla u_{h}\\}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\\,[v_{h}]$.\nAs established, $[v_h]$ is a polynomial in $\\mathcal{P}_p(F)$.\nNow we examine the term $\\{\\alpha \\nabla u_{h}\\}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$. The function $u_h$ on an element $K$ is a polynomial in $\\mathcal{P}_p(K)$. Its gradient, $\\nabla u_h|_K$, is a vector whose components are polynomials of total degree at most $p-1$.\nThe trace of this gradient vector on the face $F$, e.g., $(\\nabla u_h)^+ = (\\nabla u_h)|_{K^+}|_F$, is a vector whose components are polynomials in $\\mathcal{P}_{p-1}(F)$.\nThe average of the vector field $\\alpha \\nabla u_h$ is defined as $\\{\\alpha \\nabla u_h\\} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha (\\nabla u_h)^+ + \\alpha (\\nabla u_h)^-)$. Since $\\alpha$ is a constant, each component of the vector $\\{\\alpha \\nabla u_h\\}$ is a polynomial in $\\mathcal{P}_{p-1}(F)$.\nThe problem states that the mesh is affine, which implies that the unit normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is constant on each face $F$. The dot product $\\{\\alpha \\nabla u_h\\} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$ is a linear combination of the components of $\\{\\alpha \\nabla u_h\\}$ with the constant components of $\\boldsymbol{n}$ as coefficients. This operation results in a scalar polynomial on $F$ of total degree at most $p-1$.\nThe full integrand for the first consistency term is the product of $\\{\\alpha \\nabla u_{h}\\}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\in \\mathcal{P}_{p-1}(F)$ and $[v_{h}] \\in \\mathcal{P}_p(F)$. The product of a polynomial of degree at most $p-1$ and a polynomial of degree at most $p$ is a polynomial of degree at most $(p-1)+p = 2p-1$.\nThus, the integrands of both consistency terms are polynomials on $F$ of total degree at most $2p-1$.\n\nTo ensure that the numerical integration is exact, the quadrature rule must be exact for all polynomials up to the highest degree encountered in any of the integrands.\nThe penalty term integrand has a maximal degree of $2p$.\nThe consistency terms' integrands have a maximal degree of $2p-1$.\nThe maximum of these two degrees is $\\max(2p, 2p-1) = 2p$.\nTherefore, to guarantee exact integration of all face contributions for any choice of $u_h, v_h \\in V_h$, the quadrature rule on $F$ must be exact for all scalar polynomials of total degree at most $2p$.\nThe minimal required total-degree exactness is thus $q = 2p$.",
