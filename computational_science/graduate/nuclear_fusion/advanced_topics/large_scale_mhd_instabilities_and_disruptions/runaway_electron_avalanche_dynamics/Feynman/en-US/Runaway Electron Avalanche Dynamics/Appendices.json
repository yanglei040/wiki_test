For a control volume $V$ with uniform RE density $n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)$, the total number of REs is $N_{\\mathrm{re}}(t) = n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)V$. The time rate of change of the total number of particles is equal to the total source rate minus the total loss rate.\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)}{dt} = S_{\\mathrm{re}} - L_{\\mathrm{re}}\n$$\nwhere $S_{\\mathrm{re}}$ is the total source rate and $L_{\\mathrm{re}}$ is the total loss rate within the volume $V$.\n\nSubstituting $N_{\\mathrm{re}}(t) = n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)V$ and assuming the volume $V$ is constant, we get:\n$$\nV \\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)}{dt} = S_{\\mathrm{re}} - L_{\\mathrm{re}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the avalanche source is proportional to the local RE density $n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)$ with a constant rate $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}}$. This describes a source rate per unit volume, $s_{\\mathrm{re}}(t) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)$. The total source rate in the volume $V$ is therefore $S_{\\mathrm{re}} = s_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)V = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t) V$.\n\nThe problem also states that transport and other explicit loss processes are negligible. This implies that the total loss term $L_{\\mathrm{re}}$ is zero.\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{re}} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the source and loss terms into the conservation equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)}{dt} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t) V - 0\n$$\nDividing by the constant, non-zero volume $V$ yields the governing ordinary differential equation for the RE number density:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)}{dt} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE. To solve it, we can separate variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)} dn_{\\mathrm{re}}(t) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$. The density ranges from its initial value $n_{\\mathrm{re}}(0) = n_{\\mathrm{re}0}$ to its value at time $t$, $n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{n_{\\mathrm{re}0}}^{n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)} \\frac{1}{n'_{\\mathrm{re}}} dn'_{\\mathrm{re}} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} dt'\n$$\nSince $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}}$ is a constant, the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(n'_{\\mathrm{re}})]_{n_{\\mathrm{re}0}}^{n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} [t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)) - \\ln(n_{\\mathrm{re}0}) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms on the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)}{n_{\\mathrm{re}0}}\\right) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} t\n$$\nTo find the closed-form solution for $n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t)}{n_{\\mathrm{re}0}} = \\exp(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} t)\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{re}}(t) = n_{\\mathrm{re}0} \\exp(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} t)\n$$\nThis is the solution representing exponential growth, which is characteristic of an avalanche process.\n\nFinally, we compute the time $t^{\\star}$ required for the RE density to reach the target value $n_{\\mathrm{re}}^{\\star}$. We set $n_{\\mathrm{re}}(t^{\\star}) = n_{\\mathrm{re}}^{\\star}$ in the solution:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{re}}^{\\star} = n_{\\mathrm{re}0} \\exp(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} t^{\\star})\n$$\nTo solve for $t^{\\star}$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{re}}^{\\star}}{n_{\\mathrm{re}0}} = \\exp(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} t^{\\star})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{re}}^{\\star}}{n_{\\mathrm{re}0}}\\right) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} t^{\\star}\n$$\nSolving for $t^{\\star}$:\n$$\nt^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{re}}^{\\star}}{n_{\\mathrm{re}0}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $n_{\\mathrm{re}0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $n_{\\mathrm{re}}^{\\star} = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}} = 700\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe ratio of the densities is:\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{re}}^{\\star}}{n_{\\mathrm{re}0}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{16}}{1.0 \\times 10^{8}} = 10^{8}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $t^{\\star}$:\n$$\nt^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{700} \\ln(10^{8})\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$:\n$$\nt^{\\star} = \\frac{8 \\ln(10)}{700}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.30258509$:\n$$\nt^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{8 \\times 2.30258509}{700} \\approx \\frac{18.4206807}{700} \\approx 0.026315258\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nt^{\\star} \\approx 0.02632\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$",

            "solution": "The analysis of the electron's energy gain begins with the work-energy theorem, which states that the change in a particle's kinetic energy, $\\Delta \\mathcal{E}$, is equal to the total work, $W$, done on it. The force acting on the electron is the Lorentz force, $\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, where $q = -e$ is the charge of the electron.\n\nThe rate at which work is done on the electron is given by $\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$. Substituting the Lorentz force, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dt} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = q\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThe magnetic component of the Lorentz force, $q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, is always perpendicular to the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$. Therefore, their dot product is identically zero: $(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$. This implies that the magnetic field does no work on the electron, and any change in its kinetic energy is due solely to the electric field.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dt} = q\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = -e\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThe problem states that the electric field accelerates the electron, which means the kinetic energy must increase, so $\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dt} > 0$. The electric field is given as purely toroidal with a uniform magnitude $E_{\\phi}$, so we can write $\\mathbf{E} = E_{\\phi}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$, where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$ is the unit vector in the toroidal direction. The problem assumes the electron follows the magnetic field lines perfectly. Therefore, its velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = v_{\\parallel}\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\mathbf{B}/B$ is the unit vector along the total magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, and $v_{\\parallel}$ is the electron's speed along the field line. The problem states the electron is ultra-relativistic, so $v_{\\parallel} \\approx c$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe rate of energy gain is taken as a positive quantity:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dt} = |-e\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}| = e E_{\\phi} c |\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}|\n$$\nA magnetic field line in a tokamak is helical.

A single transit is defined as the electron advancing by a toroidal angle of $2\\pi$. The physical distance corresponding to this angular displacement at a major radius $R$ is $2\\pi R$. The electron's velocity component in the toroidal direction is $v_{\\phi} = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}$.\n$$\nv_{\\phi} = (c\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}) \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} = c \\frac{B_T}{B}\n$$\nSince the fields are uniform and the speed is constant, the transit time is the toroidal distance divided by the toroidal velocity:\n$$\nT_{transit} = \\frac{2\\pi R}{v_{\\phi}} = \\frac{2\\pi R}{c (B_T/B)} = \\frac{2\\pi R B}{c B_T}\n$$\nThis is another intermediate quantity expressed in terms of the specified variables. The energy gain per single toroidal transit, $\\Delta\\mathcal{E}$, is the rate of energy gain multiplied by the transit time, as the rate is constant under the problem's assumptions.\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathcal{E} = \\left(\\frac{d\\mathcal{E}}{dt}\\right) \\times T_{transit} = \\left(e c E_{\\phi} \\frac{B_T}{B}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2\\pi R B}{c B_T}\\right)\n$$\nThe terms $c$, $B$, and $B_T$ cancel out, yielding the derived expression for the energy gain per transit:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathcal{E} = 2\\pi R e E_{\\phi}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the energy gain per toroidal transit only depends on the toroidal loop voltage, $V_{loop} = 2\\pi R E_{\\phi}$, and is independent of the magnetic field structure (i.e., the pitch of the field lines).\n\nWe now compute the numerical value for the minimum number of transits, $N_{\\min}$.\nFirst, we calculate the energy gain per transit, $\\Delta\\mathcal{E}$, using the given values: $R=3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $E_{\\phi}=50\\,\\mathrm{V\\,m^{-1}}$. It is most convenient to express this energy in units of electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$). An electron moving through a potential difference of $V$ volts gains an energy of $V\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.

For all $t > t_c$, $E(t) < E_c^{\\ast}$ and thus $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ava}}(t) = 0$. The integral for $\\mathcal{G}$ is therefore over the interval $[0, t_c]$:\n$$ \\mathcal{G} = \\int_0^{t_c} \\frac{e}{m_e c} \\left(E(t) - E_c^{\\ast}\\right) dt = \\frac{e}{m_e c} \\left( \\int_0^{t_c} E(t)\\,dt - \\int_0^{t_c} E_c^{\\ast}\\,dt \\right) $$\nThe second term is straightforward, as $E_c^{\\ast}$ is constant: $\\int_0^{t_c} E_c^{\\ast}\\,dt = E_c^{\\ast} t_c$.\n\nTo evaluate the first term, $\\int_0^{t_c} E(t)\\,dt$, we use Faraday's law of induction. The total electromotive force (EMF) induced in the plasma loop is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux, $\\mathcal{E} = -d\\Phi/dt$. For a single-turn inductor, this is $\\mathcal{E} = -L_p dI/dt$. This induced EMF drives the current against the plasma resistance, so it must equal the total resistive voltage drop around the loop, $V_{res} = I R_p$. The pointwise relationship is given by Ohm's Law, $E(t) = \\eta j(t)$. The total resistive voltage drop is $V_{res} = \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = E(t)l = E(t)(2\\pi R)$. Therefore, the toroidal electric field that balances the inductive drive is $E(t)(2\\pi R) = -L_p dI/dt$, which gives:\n$$ E(t) = -\\frac{L_p}{2\\pi R} \\frac{dI}{dt} $$\nIntegrating this with respect to time from $t=0$ to $t=t_c$ yields:\n$$ \\int_0^{t_c} E(t)\\,dt = \\int_0^{t_c} \\left(-\\frac{L_p}{2\\pi R} \\frac{dI}{dt}\\right) dt = -\\frac{L_p}{2\\pi R} \\int_{I(0)}^{I(t_c)} dI $$\nThe current at $t=0$ is $I(0)=I_0$. At $t=t_c$, the electric field is $E(t_c) = E_c^{\\ast}$, so the current is $I(t_c) = A E(t_c) / \\eta = A E_c^{\\ast} / \\eta$. Let us define this critical current as $I_c \\equiv A E_c^{\\ast} / \\eta$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_0^{t_c} E(t)\\,dt = -\\frac{L_p}{2\\pi R} (I_c - I_0) = \\frac{L_p}{2\\pi R} (I_0 - I_c) $$\nNow, we combine the terms to find $\\mathcal{G}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{G} = \\frac{e}{m_e c} \\left( \\frac{L_p}{2\\pi R} (I_0 - I_c) - E_c^{\\ast} t_c \\right) $$\nTo find $t_c$, we must solve the current decay equation $L_p dI/dt + R_p I = 0$. The solution is $I(t) = I_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau_{CQ})$, where the current quench time constant is $\\tau_{CQ} = L_p/R_p = L_p A / (\\eta l) = L_p A / (2\\pi R \\eta)$. At $t=t_c$, $I(t_c) = I_c$, so $I_c = I_0 \\exp(-t_c/\\tau_{CQ})$. Solving for $t_c$:\n$$ t_c = \\tau_{CQ} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_c}\\right) = \\frac{L_p A}{2\\pi R \\eta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_c}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathcal{G}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{G} = \\frac{e}{m_e c} \\left( \\frac{L_p}{2\\pi R} (I_0 - I_c) - E_c^{\\ast} \\left(\\frac{L_p A}{2\\pi R \\eta}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_c}\\right) \\right) $$\nFactor out the common term $\\frac{L_p}{2\\pi R}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{G} = \\frac{e L_p}{2\\pi R m_e c} \\left( (I_0 - I_c) - \\frac{A E_c^{\\ast}}{\\eta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_c}\\right) \\right) $$\nUsing our definition $I_c = A E_c^{\\ast} / \\eta$, we can simplify the expression further:\n$$ \\mathcal{G} = \\frac{e L_p}{2\\pi R m_e c} \\left( I_0 - I_c - I_c \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_c}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{e L_p}{2\\pi R m_e c} \\left( I_0 - I_c \\left[1 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_c}\\right)\\right] \\right) $$\nThe final step is to express $I_c$ in terms of the fundamental parameters given in the problem.\n$$ I_c = \\frac{A}{\\eta} E_c^{\\ast} = A \\frac{E_{c0}(1+Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{\\eta} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\eta$ and $E_{c0}$:\n$$ I_c = A \\frac{\\left( \\frac{n_e e^3 \\ln\\Lambda}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0^2 m_e c^2} \\right) (1+Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{C_{\\eta}\\,Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,\\ln\\Lambda\\,T_q^{-3/2}} = \\frac{A n_e e^3 T_q^{3/2} (1+Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0^2 m_e c^2 C_{\\eta}\\,Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nNotably, the Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda$ cancels out. The avalanche multiplication factor $M = \\exp(\\mathcal{G})$ is therefore given by substituting this expression for $I_c$ into the formula for $\\mathcal{G}$. The final expression exposes the trade-off through the dependence on $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$: higher $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ increases the resistive field but also the critical field, with the net effect captured by the term $(1+Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})/Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in $I_c$.\n\nThe final expression for $M$ is:\n$$ M = \\exp\\left( \\frac{e L_p}{2\\pi R m_e c} \\left\\{ I_0 - \\left[ \\frac{A n_e e^3 T_q^{3/2} (1+Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0^2 m_e c^2 C_{\\eta} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right] \\left( 1 + \\ln\\left[ \\frac{I_0}{\\frac{A n_e e^3 T_q^{3/2} (1+Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0^2 m_e c^2 C_{\\eta} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} \\right] \\right) \\right\\} \\right) $$\nThis expression can be written more compactly by inverting the fraction inside the logarithm:\n$$ M = \\exp\\left( \\frac{e L_p}{2\\pi R m_e c} \\left\\{ I_0 - \\left[ \\frac{A n_e e^3 T_q^{3/2} (1+Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0^2 m_e c^2 C_{\\eta} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\right] \\left( 1 + \\ln\\left[ \\frac{4\\pi \\epsilon_0^2 m_e c^2 C_{\\eta} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} I_0}{A n_e e^3 T_q^{3/2} (1+Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})} \\right] \\right) \\right\\} \\right) $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.",
