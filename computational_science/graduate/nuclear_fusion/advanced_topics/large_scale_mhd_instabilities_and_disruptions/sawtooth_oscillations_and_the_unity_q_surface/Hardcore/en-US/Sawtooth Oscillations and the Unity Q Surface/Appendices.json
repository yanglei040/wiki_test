The solution is derived in three steps as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the poloidal magnetic field, $B_{\\theta}(r)$**\n\nWe begin with Ampère's circuital law in its integral form:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{\\text{enc}}\n$$\nDue to the specified axisymmetry of the tokamak, we choose the integration path $\\mathcal{C}$ to be a circle of constant minor radius $r$ in the poloidal cross-section. The magnetic field vector is $\\vec{B} = B_{\\theta}(r)\\hat{\\theta} + B_{\\phi}(r)\\hat{\\phi}$, and the differential line element along the path is $d\\vec{l} = r d\\theta \\hat{\\theta}$.

This is found by integrating the toroidal current density $j_{\\phi}(r)$ over this area. The differential area element is $dA = 2\\pi r' dr'$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{enc}}(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} j_{\\phi}(r') \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{r} j_{\\phi}(r') (2\\pi r' dr')\n$$\nSubstituting the given current density profile, $j_{\\phi}(r) = \\frac{j_0}{\\left(1 + \\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right)^{2}}$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{enc}}(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{j_0}{\\left(1 + \\frac{r'^2}{a^2}\\right)^{2}} (2\\pi r' dr')\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the substitution $u = 1 + \\frac{r'^2}{a^2}$.

For a large-aspect-ratio ($R_0 \\gg r$) circular tokamak, the pitch of the field line is given by the ratio of the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\frac{dl_{\\phi}}{dl_{\\theta}} = \\frac{B_{\\phi}}{B_{\\theta}}\n$$\nHere, $dl_{\\theta} = r d\\theta$ is the differential path length in the poloidal direction, and $dl_{\\phi} \\approx R_0 d\\phi$ is the differential path length in the toroidal direction (approximating the major radius of the path as $R_0$).\n$$\n\\frac{R_0 d\\phi}{r d\\theta} = \\frac{B_{\\phi}(r)}{B_{\\theta}(r)}\n$$\nRearranging for the field line trajectory in $(\\theta, \\phi)$ coordinates:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} = \\frac{r B_{\\phi}(r)}{R_0 B_{\\theta}(r)}\n$$\nThe safety factor is the total toroidal angle change $\\Delta\\phi$ over a full poloidal circuit ($\\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi$), divided by $2\\pi$:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r B_{\\phi}(r)}{R_0 B_{\\theta}(r)} d\\theta\n$$\nIn the large-aspect-ratio approximation, $B_{\\phi}$ and $B_{\\theta}$ are functions of $r$ only, making the integrand independent of $\\theta$.\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_{\\phi}(r)}{R_0 B_{\\theta}(r)}\n$$\nNow we specialize this expression using the approximation $B_{\\phi}(r) \\approx B_0$ and our derived result for $B_{\\theta}(r)$:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_0}{R_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\mu_0 j_0 r}{2\\left(1+r^2/a^2\\right)}} \\right) = \\frac{r B_0}{R_0} \\frac{2\\left(1+\\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\right)}{\\mu_0 j_0 r}\n$$\nCanceling the factor of $r$ in the numerator and denominator gives the final expression for the safety factor profile:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{2 B_0}{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r^2}{a^2} \\right)\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Solving for the radius $r_{q=1}$**\n\nThe internal kink mode responsible for sawtooth oscillations resonates at the surface where the safety factor equals unity. We set $q(r) = 1$ and solve for the corresponding radius, which we denote as $r_{q=1}$.\n$$\n1 = \\frac{2 B_0}{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{r_{q=1}^2}{a^2} \\right)\n$$\nWe algebraically rearrange this equation to isolate $r_{q=1}$:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{r_{q=1}^2}{a^2} = \\frac{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0}{2 B_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r_{q=1}^2}{a^2} = \\frac{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0}{2 B_0} - 1\n$$\n$$\nr_{q=1}^2 = a^2 \\left( \\frac{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0}{2 B_0} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the solution for $r_{q=1}$:\n$$\nr_{q=1} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0}{2 B_0} - 1}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n$R_0 = 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{m}$, $a = 1.0 \\,\\mathrm{m}$, $B_0 = 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{T}$, $j_0 = 2.000 \\times 10^{6} \\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$, and $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m / A}$.\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless quantity inside the square root:\n$$\n\\frac{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0}{2 B_0} = \\frac{(3.0) \\cdot (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\cdot (2.000 \\times 10^{6})}{2 \\cdot (3.0)} = \\frac{2.4\\pi \\times 10^0}{6.0} = 0.4\\pi\n$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for $r_{q=1}$:\n$$\nr_{q=1} = (1.0) \\cdot \\sqrt{0.4\\pi - 1}\n$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\nr_{q=1} = \\sqrt{0.4\\pi - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{0.4(3.14159265) - 1} = \\sqrt{1.25663706 - 1} = \\sqrt{0.25663706}\n$$\n$$\nr_{q=1} \\approx 0.50659369 \\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\nr_{q=1} \\approx 0.5066 \\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$",

            "solution": "The user has provided a two-part problem concerning the resistive internal kink mode in a tokamak plasma. The first task is to derive the scaling of the instability's linear growth rate, $\\gamma$, with the Lundquist number, $S_1$. The second task is to compute the ratio of growth rates for two plasma discharges differing only in electron temperature, $T_e$.\n\nThe problem has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-consistent. The parameters provided are realistic for a tokamak operating in the resistive MHD regime.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Growth Rate Scaling**\n\nThe resistive internal kink mode is characterized by poloidal and toroidal mode numbers $(m,n)=(1,1)$. Its dynamics are governed by two distinct spatial regions: an outer region, which is well-described by ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and a thin resistive layer centered on the rational surface where the safety factor $q(r_1)=1$. The growth rate of the instability is determined by the physics within this resistive layer, where inertia and resistivity become important and allow for magnetic field lines to break and reconnect.\n\nWe can derive the scaling of the growth rate, $\\gamma$, by balancing the characteristic timescales of the dominant physical processes within the resistive layer of width $\\delta$. Let $x=r-r_1$ be the radial coordinate within the layer.\n\n1.  **Inertial Timescale:** The instability involves the motion of the plasma. The inertia of the plasma resists this acceleration. The driving force for the instability comes from the release of magnetic energy, which leads to a $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ force. In the layer, this force is balanced by the plasma inertia. The characteristic timescale for this dynamic is the Alfvén time associated with the parallel wave-vector $k_{||}$ within the layer. The parallel wave-vector for a perturbation of the form $\\exp(i(m\\theta-n\\phi))$ is given by $k_{||} = (m/r)B_p/B_t - n/R = (m/q(r) - n) / R$. For the $(m,n)=(1,1)$ mode near $r=r_1$, we can approximate $q(r) \\approx q(r_1) + q'(r_1)x = 1+q'(r_1)x$.\n    $$k_{||}(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+q'(r_1)x} - 1\\right) \\approx -\\frac{q'(r_1)x}{R}$$\n    Using the definition of magnetic shear, $s_1 = (r_1/q_1) dq/dr|_{r_1} = r_1 q'(r_1)$, we have $k_{||}(x) \\approx - (s_1 x)/(R r_1)$.\n    Within the layer of characteristic width $\\delta$, we have $x \\sim \\delta$, so $k_{||} \\sim s_1 \\delta / (R r_1)$.\n    The growth of the mode is limited by how quickly an Alfvén wave can travel along the perturbed magnetic field lines. The characteristic time for this process, the inertial time, is $\\tau_{inertia} \\sim 1/(k_{||} v_A)$, where $v_A$ is the Alfvén speed. The growth rate must be of the order of the inverse of this time:\n    $$\\gamma \\sim k_{||} v_A \\sim \\frac{s_1 \\delta v_A}{R r_1}$$\n\n2.  **Resistive Diffusion Timescale:** For magnetic reconnection to occur, magnetic field lines must diffuse through the plasma. This process is governed by the plasma resistivity, $\\eta$. The characteristic time for magnetic diffusion across the layer of width $\\delta$ is $\\tau_{resistive} \\sim \\mu_0 \\delta^2 / \\eta$. The instability cannot grow faster than the rate at which resistivity allows the magnetic topology to change. Therefore, the growth rate is also set by the resistive diffusion rate:\n    $$\\gamma \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 \\delta^2}$$\n\n3.  **Solving for the Growth Rate:** We have two independent relations for the growth rate $\\gamma$ and the layer width $\\delta$. We can solve this system to find the scaling of $\\gamma$.\n    From the resistive scaling, we express $\\delta^2$ in terms of $\\gamma$:\n    $$\\delta^2 \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 \\gamma}$$\n    Substituting this into the inertial scaling relation:\n    $$\\gamma \\sim \\frac{s_1 v_A}{R r_1} \\delta = \\frac{s_1 v_A}{R r_1} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 \\gamma}}$$\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n    $$\\gamma^{3/2} \\sim \\frac{s_1 v_A}{R r_1} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0}}$$\n    Cubing both sides gives:\n    $$\\gamma^3 \\sim \\left(\\frac{s_1 v_A}{R r_1}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} = \\frac{s_1^2 v_A^2 \\eta}{\\mu_0 R^2 r_1^2}$$\n    The problem asks for the scaling with the Lundquist number at the $q=1$ surface, $S_1 = \\mu_0 r_1 v_A / \\eta$. We can substitute $\\eta = \\mu_0 r_1 v_A / S_1$ into our expression for $\\gamma^3$:\n    $$\\gamma^3 \\sim \\frac{s_1^2 v_A^2}{\\mu_0 R^2 r_1^2} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0 r_1 v_A}{S_1}\\right) = \\frac{s_1^2 v_A^3}{R^2 r_1 S_1}$$\n    Taking the cube root, we find the scaling for the growth rate $\\gamma$:\n    $$\\gamma \\sim \\left(\\frac{s_1^2 v_A^3}{R^2 r_1 S_1}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{v_A}{R^{2/3} r_1^{1/3}} s_1^{2/3} S_1^{-1/3}$$\n    This expression shows that the growth rate is proportional to $S_1^{-1/3}$, as required. The dependence on the shear $s_1$ and geometric factors $R$ and $r_1$ enters into the coefficient of proportionality.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Ratio of Growth Rates**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of growth rates $\\gamma_B/\\gamma_A$ for two discharges, A and B, which are identical except for their electron temperatures, $T_{e,A}$ and $T_{e,B}$.\n\nFrom the scaling derived in Part 1, we have:\n$$\\gamma \\propto s_1^{2/3} v_A R^{-2/3} r_1^{-1/3} S_1^{-1/3}$$\nWe need to determine how each parameter in this scaling depends on the electron temperature $T_e$.\n\n-   **Major and Minor Radii ($R, a$):** These are fixed geometric parameters of the device, so they are the same for both discharges.\n-   **Safety Factor Profile ($q_0, \\alpha$):** These are given as identical for both discharges.\n-   **Radius of the $q=1$ surface ($r_1$):** This is determined by the $q$-profile: $q(r_1) = 1 \\implies q_0 + \\alpha(r_1/a)^2 = 1 \\implies r_1 = a \\sqrt{(1-q_0)/\\alpha}$. Since $a$, $q_0$, and $\\alpha$ are the same for A and B, $r_1$ is also the same.\n-   **Magnetic Shear at $q=1$ ($s_1$):** The shear is given by $s_1 = (r/q) dq/dr|_{r_1}$. From $q(r) = q_0 + \\alpha(r/a)^2$, we have $dq/dr=2\\alpha r/a^2$. Thus, $s_1 = (r_1/1) (2\\alpha r_1/a^2) = 2\\alpha (r_1/a)^2 = 2\\alpha (1-q_0)/\\alpha = 2(1-q_0)$. Since $q_0$ is the same for A and B, $s_1$ is also the same.\n-   **Alfvén Speed ($v_A$):** The Alfvén speed is $v_A = B_0 / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}$. The toroidal field $B_0$ and the mass density $\\rho$ are given as identical for both discharges. Therefore, $v_A$ is the same for A and B.\n-   **Lundquist Number ($S_1$):** The Lundquist number is $S_1 = \\mu_0 r_1 v_A / \\eta$. Since $r_1$ and $v_A$ are constant between the two discharges, the dependence of $S_1$ on temperature comes entirely from the resistivity, $\\eta$.\n    $$S_1 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\eta}$$\nThe problem states that the plasma has a collisional (Spitzer) resistivity, which scales with electron temperature as $\\eta \\propto T_e^{-3/2}$ for fixed $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\\ln\\Lambda$.\nCombining these relations, we find the temperature dependence of $S_1$:\n$$S_1 \\propto \\frac{1}{T_e^{-3/2}} \\propto T_e^{3/2}$$\nNow we can determine the temperature scaling of the growth rate $\\gamma$. Since all other parameters in the scaling law are constant, the ratio of growth rates depends only on the ratio of Lundquist numbers:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma_B}{\\gamma_A} = \\left(\\frac{S_{1,B}}{S_{1,A}}\\right)^{-1/3}$$\nUsing the temperature scaling of $S_1$:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma_B}{\\gamma_A} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_{e,B}}{T_{e,A}}\\right)^{3/2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_{e,B}}{T_{e,A}}\\right)^{(3/2) \\times (-1/3)} = \\left(\\frac{T_{e,B}}{T_{e,A}}\\right)^{-1/2}$$\nWe are given the electron temperatures for the two discharges:\n-   $T_{e,A} = 3\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n-   $T_{e,B} = 12\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\nSubstituting these values into our expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma_B}{\\gamma_A} = \\left(\\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{keV}}{3\\,\\mathrm{keV}}\\right)^{-1/2} = (4)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe ratio of the growth rates is $0.5$.

Assume the toroidal geometry is well approximated by the large-aspect-ratio toroidal volume element $dV = 4\\pi^{2} R \\, r \\, dr$, and the electron thermal energy density is $w_{e}(r) = \\frac{3}{2} n_{e}(r) k_{B} T_{e}(r)$, where $n_{e}$ is the electron density and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nLet the pre-crash electron density be uniform, $n_{e}(r) = n_{0}$, and the pre-crash electron temperature inside the $q=1$ surface be\n$$\nT_{e}^{\\text{core}}(r) = T_{c}\\left[1 - \\alpha \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{q=1}}\\right)^{2}\\right], \\quad 0 \\leq r \\leq r_{q=1},\n$$\nwhile in the annulus $r_{q=1} \\leq r \\leq r_{m}$ it is uniform and equal to\n$$\nT_{e}^{\\text{shell}}(r) = T_{s}.\n$$\nDuring the crash, a fraction $\\mu$ (by electron number or equivalently by volume, since $n_{0}$ is uniform) of the annulus $r_{q=1} \\leq r \\leq r_{m}$ mixes with the core. The post-crash electron temperature is observed to be flattened inside $r \\leq r_{q=1}$ to a uniform value $T_{e}^{\\text{post}}$. Using conservation of electron thermal energy within the mixed subsystem, derive an analytic expression for $T_{e}^{\\text{post}}$ in terms of $T_{c}$, $\\alpha$, $T_{s}$, $r_{q=1}$, $r_{m}$, and $\\mu$, and then evaluate it for the following parameters:\n- $R = 3$, $a = 1$, $r_{q=1} = 0.3$, $r_{m} = 0.45$ (all in meters),\n- $T_{c} = 6$ and $T_{s} = 2.5$ (both in kilo-electronvolts, keV),\n- $\\alpha = 0.5$,\n- $\\mu = 0.4$,\n- $n_{0}$ uniform and constant.\n\nExplicitly verify that your expression enforces conservation of electron thermal energy in the mixed subsystem. Round your final numerical value of $T_{e}^{\\text{post}}$ to four significant figures and express it in keV. Your final answer must be a single real-valued number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the post-sawtooth-crash electron temperature, $T_{e}^{\\text{post}}$, based on the principle of electron thermal energy conservation within a defined mixed subsystem. The subsystem consists of all electrons within the core region, $0 \\leq r \\leq r_{q=1}$, and a fraction $\\mu$ of the electrons in the annulus, $r_{q=1} \\leq r \\leq r_{m}$. The electron density $n_{e}(r)$ is given as a uniform constant, $n_{0}$.\n\nThe total electron thermal energy $W_{e}$ in a given volume is the integral of the electron thermal energy density, $w_{e}(r) = \\frac{3}{2} n_{e}(r) k_{B} T_{e}(r)$, over that volume. Using the provided large-aspect-ratio toroidal volume element, $dV = 4\\pi^{2} R r dr$, the energy is:\n$$\nW_{e} = \\int w_{e}(r) dV = \\int \\frac{3}{2} n_{0} k_{B} T_{e}(r) (4\\pi^{2} R r dr) = 6\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} \\int T_{e}(r) r dr\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total thermal energy of the mixed subsystem before the crash, $W_{e, \\text{pre}}$. This is the sum of the energy in the core ($W_{e, \\text{core}}$) and the energy in a fraction $\\mu$ of the annulus ($W_{e, \\mu\\text{-annulus}}$).\n\nThe pre-crash energy in the core ($0 \\leq r \\leq r_{q=1}$) is:\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{core}} = 6\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} \\int_{0}^{r_{q=1}} T_{e}^{\\text{core}}(r) r dr\n$$\nSubstituting $T_{e}^{\\text{core}}(r) = T_{c}\\left[1 - \\alpha \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{q=1}}\\right)^{2}\\right]$:\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{core}} = 6\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} T_{c} \\int_{0}^{r_{q=1}} \\left(r - \\frac{\\alpha r^3}{r_{q=1}^{2}}\\right) dr\n$$\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{core}} = 6\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} T_{c} \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{\\alpha r^4}{4r_{q=1}^{2}} \\right]_{0}^{r_{q=1}} = 6\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} T_{c} \\left( \\frac{r_{q=1}^{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\alpha r_{q=1}^{2}}{4} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{core}} = 3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} T_{c} r_{q=1}^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe total energy in the full annulus ($r_{q=1} \\leq r \\leq r_{m}$) where the temperature is a uniform $T_{s}$ is:\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{annulus}}^{\\text{full}} = 6\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} \\int_{r_{q=1}}^{r_{m}} T_{s} r dr = 6\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} T_{s} \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} \\right]_{r_{q=1}}^{r_{m}}\n$$\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{annulus}}^{\\text{full}} = 3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} T_{s} (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2})\n$$\nThe fraction of this energy that participates in the mixing is $\\mu W_{e, \\text{annulus}}^{\\text{full}}$:\n$$\nW_{e, \\mu\\text{-annulus}} = 3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} \\mu T_{s} (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2})\n$$\nThe total pre-crash energy in the mixed subsystem is the sum:\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{pre}} = W_{e, \\text{core}} + W_{e, \\mu\\text{-annulus}} = 3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} \\left[ T_{c} r_{q=1}^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right) + \\mu T_{s} (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right]\n$$\nNext, we calculate the thermal energy of the subsystem after the crash, $W_{e, \\text{post}}$. The problem states that electron populations are mixed and the density remains unchanged ($n_{0}$). This implies that the number of particles in the subsystem is conserved, and therefore the volume occupied by the mixed subsystem is also conserved. The pre-crash volume of the mixed subsystem is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{mix}} = V_{\\text{core}} + \\mu V_{\\text{annulus}}^{\\text{full}} = \\int_{0}^{r_{q=1}} 4\\pi^{2} R r dr + \\mu \\int_{r_{q=1}}^{r_{m}} 4\\pi^{2} R r dr\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{mix}} = 2\\pi^{2} R r_{q=1}^{2} + \\mu \\left( 2\\pi^{2} R (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right) = 2\\pi^{2} R \\left[ r_{q=1}^{2} + \\mu (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right]\n$$\nAfter the crash, the temperature of this mixed volume is uniform at $T_{e}^{\\text{post}}$. The post-crash energy is therefore:\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{post}} = w_{e}^{\\text{post}} V_{\\text{mix}} = \\left( \\frac{3}{2} n_{0} k_{B} T_{e}^{\\text{post}} \\right) V_{\\text{mix}}\n$$\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{post}} = \\left( \\frac{3}{2} n_{0} k_{B} T_{e}^{\\text{post}} \\right) \\left( 2\\pi^{2} R \\left[ r_{q=1}^{2} + \\mu (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{post}} = 3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} T_{e}^{\\text{post}} \\left[ r_{q=1}^{2} + \\mu (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right]\n$$\nBy the principle of energy conservation, $W_{e, \\text{pre}} = W_{e, \\text{post}}$:\n$$\n3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} \\left[ T_{c} r_{q=1}^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right) + \\mu T_{s} (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right] = 3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} T_{e}^{\\text{post}} \\left[ r_{q=1}^{2} + \\mu (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right]\n$$\nThe common factor $3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B}$ cancels. Solving for $T_{e}^{\\text{post}}$ yields the analytical expression:\n$$\nT_{e}^{\\text{post}} = \\frac{T_{c} r_{q=1}^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right) + \\mu T_{s} (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2})}{r_{q=1}^{2} + \\mu(r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2})}\n$$\nThis expression represents the volume-weighted average temperature of the initial mixed components.\n\nTo explicitly verify that this expression enforces energy conservation, we can substitute it back into the equation for $W_{e, \\text{post}}$:\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{post}} = 3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} \\left( \\frac{T_{c} r_{q=1}^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right) + \\mu T_{s} (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2})}{r_{q=1}^{2} + \\mu(r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2})} \\right) \\left[ r_{q=1}^{2} + \\mu (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right]\n$$\nThe denominator cancels with the final term, leaving:\n$$\nW_{e, \\text{post}} = 3\\pi^{2} R n_{0} k_{B} \\left[ T_{c} r_{q=1}^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right) + \\mu T_{s} (r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2}) \\right]\n$$\nThis is identical to the expression for $W_{e, \\text{pre}}$, thus confirming that the derived $T_{e}^{\\text{post}}$ ensures conservation of electron thermal energy.\n\nNow, we evaluate the expression for the given parameters: $T_{c} = 6$ keV, $\\alpha = 0.5$, $T_{s} = 2.5$ keV, $r_{q=1} = 0.3$ m, $r_{m} = 0.45$ m, and $\\mu = 0.4$.\nWe first compute the geometric factors:\n$r_{q=1}^{2} = (0.3)^{2} = 0.09$ m$^2$.\n$r_{m}^{2} = (0.45)^{2} = 0.2025$ m$^2$.\n$r_{m}^{2} - r_{q=1}^{2} = 0.2025 - 0.09 = 0.1125$ m$^2$.\nThe temperature profile factor is $1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 1 - \\frac{0.5}{2} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nSubstitute these values into the numerator of the expression for $T_{e}^{\\text{post}}$:\nNumerator $= (6) \\cdot (0.09) \\cdot (0.75) + (0.4) \\cdot (2.5) \\cdot (0.1125)$\nNumerator $= 0.405 + 1 \\cdot (0.1125) = 0.5175$.\n\nSubstitute into the denominator:\nDenominator $= 0.09 + (0.4) \\cdot (0.1125)$\nDenominator $= 0.09 + 0.045 = 0.135$.\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio:\n$$\nT_{e}^{\\text{post}} = \\frac{0.5175}{0.135} = 3.8333... \\text{ keV}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the post-crash temperature is $3.833$ keV.",
