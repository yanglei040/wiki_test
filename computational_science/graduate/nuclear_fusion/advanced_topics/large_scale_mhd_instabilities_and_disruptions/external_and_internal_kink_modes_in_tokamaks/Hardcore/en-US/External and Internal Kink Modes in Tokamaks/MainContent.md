## Introduction
Magnetically confined plasmas in tokamaks are subject to a variety of instabilities that can limit performance and even terminate the discharge. Among the most fundamental and impactful of these are magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) [kink modes](@entry_id:182102)—large-scale, helical deformations of the plasma column driven by the very currents and pressure gradients that sustain it. Understanding the physics behind these instabilities is not an academic exercise; it is a critical requirement for designing and operating a successful fusion reactor. This article addresses this need by systematically exploring the origins, consequences, and control of both internal and external [kink modes](@entry_id:182102).

The journey begins in the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, which lays the theoretical foundation by introducing helical perturbations, the crucial concept of [magnetic resonance](@entry_id:143712) at rational surfaces, and the powerful MHD [energy principle](@entry_id:748989). It then dissects the distinct physics of the core-localized internal kink, the cause of sawtooth crashes, and the boundary-deforming external kink, which sets key operational limits. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, bridges theory and practice, showing how these modes are identified with [plasma diagnostics](@entry_id:189276), how they define the operational space of a tokamak, and how sophisticated feedback systems are engineered to control them. This section also explores the frontier where fluid MHD meets kinetic physics, explaining hybrid instabilities like the fishbone mode. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section provides guided problems to solidify the reader's understanding of core concepts like the stabilizing effect of [magnetic shear](@entry_id:188804) and the fundamental nature of MHD stability limits.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The stability of a [magnetically confined plasma](@entry_id:202728) is governed by the principles of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Perturbations from equilibrium can release free energy stored in the plasma's pressure gradients and electrical currents, leading to instabilities that can degrade or terminate confinement. Among the most fundamental of these are the kink instabilities, which are large-scale, coherent deformations of the plasma column. This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms governing both internal and external [kink modes in tokamaks](@entry_id:751037).

### Helical Perturbations and Magnetic Resonance

A [tokamak](@entry_id:160432) plasma is inherently a three-dimensional toroidal system. Perturbations to the equilibrium are best described using a coordinate system aligned with the geometry, such as flux coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$, where $r$ is a radial-like coordinate labeling a [magnetic flux surface](@entry_id:751622), $\theta$ is the poloidal angle (the short way around the torus), and $\phi$ is the toroidal angle (the long way around).

Small-amplitude perturbations, such as a displacement of the plasma fluid $\boldsymbol{\xi}$, can be decomposed into Fourier harmonics. Due to the toroidal and poloidal periodicity of the system, these harmonics take a helical form:
$$
\boldsymbol{\xi}(r, \theta, \phi) \propto \exp[i(m\theta - n\phi)]
$$
Here, $m$ is the **poloidal mode number**, which counts the number of wavelengths of the perturbation in the poloidal direction, and $n$ is the **toroidal mode number**, counting the wavelengths in the toroidal direction . These modes represent helical "wrinkles" on the plasma's [magnetic surfaces](@entry_id:204802).

The stability of such a helical perturbation is critically dependent on how its structure aligns with the equilibrium magnetic field lines. The topology of the magnetic field itself is characterized by the **safety factor**, denoted by $q(r)$. Geometrically, $q(r)$ is the number of toroidal turns a magnetic field line makes for every one poloidal turn as it traces out a path on a flux surface. In a large-aspect-ratio [tokamak](@entry_id:160432) with major radius $R_0$ and a primarily [toroidal magnetic field](@entry_id:756057) $B_\phi$, the [safety factor](@entry_id:156168) is well approximated by:
$$
q(r) = \frac{r B_\phi}{R_0 B_\theta(r)}
$$
where $B_\theta(r)$ is the [poloidal magnetic field](@entry_id:753563) generated by the [toroidal plasma](@entry_id:202484) current. This [poloidal field](@entry_id:188655) can be determined from the toroidal [current density](@entry_id:190690) profile, $j_\phi(r)$, using Ampère's Law, $\oint \boldsymbol{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{l} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}}$ .

A key concept arises when the pitch of a helical perturbation matches the pitch of the magnetic field lines. The pitch of an $(m,n)$ perturbation is $m/n$. The pitch of the field lines is $q(r)$. When these are equal, the system is in resonance. A magnetic surface at radius $r_s$ where this condition is met,
$$
q(r_s) = \frac{m}{n}
$$
is known as a **rational surface**. On such a surface, the perturbation's structure is perfectly aligned with the magnetic field.

Mathematically, this resonance is expressed through the **parallel wave number**, $k_\parallel$, which measures the component of the perturbation's [wave vector](@entry_id:272479) parallel to the equilibrium magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B}$. For a perturbation of the form $\exp[i(m\theta - n\phi)]$, the parallel wave number is proportional to $(m - nq(r))$. At a rational surface where $q(r_s) = m/n$, it is clear that $k_\parallel(r_s) = 0$ . This vanishing of the parallel wave number is the fundamental condition for resonance and is the primary reason why rational surfaces are the sites of many MHD instabilities.

### The Ideal MHD Energy Principle

To understand why resonance is so important, we turn to the ideal MHD **[energy principle](@entry_id:748989)**. This powerful principle states that a [plasma equilibrium](@entry_id:184963) is stable if and only if the change in potential energy, $\delta W$, resulting from any small fluid displacement $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ is positive ($\delta W > 0$). If a displacement can be found for which $\delta W < 0$, the plasma is unstable, as it can reach a lower energy state by deforming.

The total energy change $\delta W$ can be conceptually decomposed into several competing contributions:
$$
\delta W = \delta W_{\text{bend}} + \delta W_{\text{compress}} + \delta W_{\text{drive}}
$$

1.  **Field-Line Bending ($\delta W_{\text{bend}}$)**: Magnetic field lines behave like elastic strings; bending them costs energy. This term is proportional to the square of the parallel wave number, $\int k_\parallel^2 |\boldsymbol{\xi}|^2 dV$. It is always positive and represents the dominant stabilizing effect in the plasma.

2.  **Plasma Compression ($\delta W_{\text{compress}}$)**: Compressing the plasma also costs energy. This term is also stabilizing.

3.  **Instability Drives ($\delta W_{\text{drive}}$)**: These terms can be negative, representing sources of free energy. The two primary drives for [kink modes](@entry_id:182102) are:
    *   **Current Gradients**: The magnetic energy associated with the [plasma current](@entry_id:182365) itself. Sharp gradients in the [current density](@entry_id:190690) profile can provide a powerful drive for instability.
    *   **Pressure Gradients and Curvature**: In the curved magnetic field of a torus, a plasma displacement that moves high-pressure plasma into a region of lower magnetic field strength can release energy. This occurs in regions of **unfavorable curvature**, such as the outboard side (low-field side) of the [tokamak](@entry_id:160432), where the field lines are convex with respect to the plasma. The drive term is proportional to the product of the pressure gradient and the curvature, and it is destabilizing where $\boldsymbol{\kappa} \cdot \nabla p > 0$ .

The stability of any given mode is a competition between these terms. The condition $k_\parallel = 0$ at a rational surface is so critical because it causes the dominant stabilizing field-line bending term, $\delta W_{\text{bend}}$, to vanish locally. This allows the comparatively weaker driving terms to overcome the remaining stabilization and potentially lead to an instability with $\delta W < 0$ .

### The Internal Kink Mode and Sawtooth Crashes

The most fundamental [kink instability](@entry_id:192309) is the **[internal kink mode](@entry_id:750752)**, characterized by mode numbers $(m=1, n=1)$. This mode is resonant on the $q=1$ rational surface.

For this mode to be potentially unstable, a $q=1$ surface must exist within the plasma. Since the [safety factor](@entry_id:156168) profile $q(r)$ in a standard tokamak typically increases from the magnetic axis ($r=0$) to the edge ($r=a$), a necessary condition for the existence of a $q=1$ surface is that the on-axis safety factor is less than one: $q(0) < 1$ .

If this condition is met, the $(1,1)$ [internal kink mode](@entry_id:750752) manifests as a rigid, helical displacement of the hot plasma core located inside the $q=1$ surface. The perturbation amplitude is small outside this radius, barely affecting the plasma boundary. As such, the internal kink is treated as a **fixed-boundary** problem, where the plasma displacement at the edge is effectively zero, $\boldsymbol{n}\cdot\boldsymbol{\xi}(a) = 0$ .

The primary significance of the [internal kink mode](@entry_id:750752) is its role in the **[sawtooth crash](@entry_id:754512)**, a phenomenon observed in the core of nearly all tokamaks. The process unfolds in a cycle:
1.  **Heating Phase**: Central [plasma heating](@entry_id:158813) (e.g., Ohmic heating) causes the [current density](@entry_id:190690) to peak on-axis, which in turn causes $q(0)$ to slowly drop below 1.
2.  **Instability Growth**: Once $q(0) < 1$, the ideal internal kink becomes unstable and begins to grow, producing the helical shift of the hot core.
3.  **Reconnection and Crash**: The ideal MHD displacement brings regions of oppositely directed magnetic field into close contact at the $q=1$ surface, forming a thin, intense current sheet. Within this sheet, even a small amount of [plasma resistivity](@entry_id:196902) becomes important, violating the "[frozen-in flux](@entry_id:275379)" condition of ideal MHD. This allows **[magnetic reconnection](@entry_id:188309)** to occur, a rapid process that changes the [magnetic topology](@entry_id:751637). The hot, displaced core reconnects with the cooler surrounding magnetic field lines, leading to a violent mixing event.
4.  **Aftermath**: The reconnection expels the hot core plasma, rapidly flattening the temperature and density profiles inside the $q=1$ region. This is observed as a sudden drop in central temperature—the "[sawtooth crash](@entry_id:754512)." After the crash, the magnetic field settles into a state with $q(0) \geq 1$, and the heating cycle begins anew .

The sawtooth cycle is a classic example of how an ideal MHD mode can initiate a process that culminates in a rapid, non-ideal event with significant consequences for [plasma confinement](@entry_id:203546).

### The External Kink Mode and Operational Limits

In contrast to the internal kink, the **[external kink mode](@entry_id:749196)** is a **free-boundary** instability, meaning it involves a significant displacement of the plasma's outer surface . This has profound implications for its stability. Because the plasma boundary moves, the analysis must include the vacuum region surrounding the plasma. The total potential energy change for an external kink can be decomposed as:
$$
\delta W_{\text{total}} = \delta W_{\text{plasma}} + \delta W_{\text{vacuum}}
$$

Here, $\delta W_{\text{plasma}}$ represents the energy change within the plasma, containing both stabilizing terms and the destabilizing drive from the [plasma current](@entry_id:182365) profile. $\delta W_{\text{vacuum}}$ is the energy stored in the perturbed magnetic field in the vacuum region surrounding the plasma. Since this energy is given by $\int_{\text{vacuum}} \frac{|\delta \boldsymbol{B}|^2}{2\mu_0} dV$, it is always positive ($\delta W_{\text{vacuum}} \ge 0$) and therefore always **stabilizing**. An external kink can only become unstable if the energy released from within the plasma ($\delta W_{\text{plasma}} < 0$) is large enough to overcome the energy cost of perturbing the vacuum field .

The free-boundary nature of the external kink necessitates a different set of boundary conditions at the plasma edge ($r=a$). Instead of a rigid wall, we have a plasma-vacuum interface. Across this moving interface, the normal component of the magnetic field and the total pressure (fluid + magnetic) must be continuous .

A crucial element in controlling the external kink is the presence of a conducting wall. If a perfectly conducting wall is placed around the plasma at a radius $r=b > a$, it imposes the boundary condition that the normal component of the perturbed magnetic field must vanish at the wall, $\boldsymbol{n}\cdot\delta\boldsymbol{B}(b) = 0$. This constraint "squeezes" the perturbed vacuum field, increasing the energy $\delta W_{\text{vacuum}}$ required for a given boundary displacement. Consequently, **a nearby conducting wall is a powerful stabilizer for the [external kink mode](@entry_id:749196)**. The closer the wall is to the plasma, the stronger the stabilization. In the absence of a wall ($b \to \infty$), this stabilizing effect is minimized, and the plasma is most vulnerable to external kinks . This principle is the basis for the Kruskal-Shafranov limit, which sets a maximum allowable [plasma current](@entry_id:182365) for a given magnetic field and geometry to ensure stability against the $m=1$ external kink.

### Refinements to Kink Stability

The basic picture of current-driven kinks competing with field-line bending can be refined by including other important physical effects.

**Magnetic Shear**

The radial variation of the [safety factor](@entry_id:156168) is quantified by the **[magnetic shear](@entry_id:188804)**, $s(r) = \frac{r}{q} \frac{dq}{dr}$. Shear plays a critical role in stability. As shown previously, the stabilizing field-line bending term is proportional to $k_\parallel^2$. While $k_\parallel$ is zero *at* the rational surface, any perturbation with a finite radial extent will sample regions where $k_\parallel \neq 0$. The rate at which $k_\parallel$ increases away from the rational surface is directly proportional to the magnetic shear. A high-shear plasma thus imposes a much larger energy penalty for any radially extended mode. This significantly enhances the stabilizing $\delta W_{\text{bend}}$ term. The stabilization is proportional to $s^2$, meaning both positive and negative shear are stabilizing compared to zero shear. Low magnetic shear, particularly near the plasma edge, is known to be destabilizing for external [kink modes](@entry_id:182102) as it lowers the energy cost of deforming the boundary .

**Pressure and Toroidicity**

While kinks are primarily current-driven, their stability is also modified by the [plasma pressure](@entry_id:753503) and the [toroidal geometry](@entry_id:756056). As mentioned, the combination of a pressure gradient and unfavorable magnetic curvature provides an instability drive. This pressure drive can significantly lower the stability threshold for external kinks, leading to so-called "kink-ballooning" modes at high [plasma beta](@entry_id:192193) (the ratio of [plasma pressure](@entry_id:753503) to [magnetic pressure](@entry_id:272413)). For the internal kink, the resonance at $q=1$ dramatically reduces the competing line-[bending energy](@entry_id:174691), making the mode particularly susceptible to being driven unstable by even a modest pressure gradient .

Furthermore, the [toroidal geometry](@entry_id:756056) itself introduces a coupling between different poloidal harmonics. In a simple cylinder, each poloidal mode number $m$ is independent. In a torus, however, the poloidal variation of the magnetic field strength and curvature couples a given harmonic $m$ to its neighbors, $m \pm 1$. The strength of this **toroidal coupling** is proportional to the inverse [aspect ratio](@entry_id:177707), $\epsilon = a/R_0$. This coupling can be either stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the details of the pressure and current profiles, by allowing the perturbation to more efficiently access regions of unfavorable curvature or by coupling it to more stable [sidebands](@entry_id:261079) .

Finally, it is important to distinguish these global, low-mode-number [kink modes](@entry_id:182102) from other classes of MHD instabilities. Localized, high-mode-number "interchange" or "ballooning" modes are driven by the pressure gradient at each flux surface. Their stability is assessed by local criteria, such as the Suydam criterion (in a cylinder) or the Mercier criterion (in a torus), which balance local shear against the local pressure and curvature drives. Kink modes, by contrast, are global structures whose stability depends on the integrated profiles of current and pressure across the entire plasma volume and on the boundary conditions imposed by the vacuum and surrounding conducting structures .
