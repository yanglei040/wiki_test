Over this narrow frequency band, assume pure absorption with a uniform absorption coefficient $\\kappa_{\\nu}$, and neglect both emission and scattering. Define the optical thickness across the slab as $\\tau_{\\nu} = \\kappa_{\\nu} L$. Let the slab be aligned with the $z$-axis such that the illuminated face is at $z = 0$ (optical depth $0$) and the transmitted face is at $z = L$ (optical depth $\\tau_{\\nu}$).

            "solution": "The problem asks for the transmitted monochromatic specific intensity, $I_{\\nu,\\mathrm{tr}}(\\mu)$, emerging from a plane-parallel slab of material. The derivation will be based on the steady-state, one-dimensional radiative transfer equation (RTE) using the method of characteristics.\n\nThe general form of the steady-state RTE in a plane-parallel geometry, with position denoted by the coordinate $z$ along the slab normal, is:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{dI_{\\nu}(z,\\mu)}{dz} = j_{\\nu}(z,\\mu) - \\alpha_{\\nu}(z) I_{\\nu}(z,\\mu) + \\text{scattering terms}\n$$\nwhere $I_{\\nu}(z,\\mu)$ is the specific intensity at frequency $\\nu$, position $z$, and direction cosine $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$. The term $j_{\\nu}$ represents the emission coefficient (emissivity), and $\\alpha_{\\nu}$ represents the absorption coefficient.\n\nThe problem statement provides several simplifications:\n$1$. The medium exhibits pure absorption, so the extinction coefficient $\\alpha_{\\nu}$ is equal to the absorption coefficient $\\kappa_{\\nu}$.\n$2$. Emission is neglected, so the emission coefficient $j_{\\nu} = 0$.\n$3$. Scattering is neglected, so the scattering terms are zero.\n$4$. The absorption coefficient $\\kappa_{\\nu}$ is uniform throughout the slab.\n\nApplying these conditions, the RTE simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{dI_{\\nu}(z,\\mu)}{dz} = -\\kappa_{\\nu} I_{\\nu}(z,\\mu)\n$$\nThis equation describes the attenuation of the specific intensity as it propagates through the purely absorbing slab.\n\nTo solve this equation, it is convenient to introduce an optical depth variable. Let's define the normal optical depth, $\\tau_z$, measured from the illuminated face at $z=0$ into the slab:\n$$\nd\\tau_z = \\kappa_{\\nu} dz\n$$\nSince $\\kappa_{\\nu}$ is uniform, we can integrate this definition from the face at $z=0$ to an arbitrary position $z$ within the slab:\n$$\n\\tau_z(z) = \\int_0^z \\kappa_{\\nu} dz' = \\kappa_{\\nu} z\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, we can rewrite the derivative with respect to $z$ in terms of $\\tau_z$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dz} = \\frac{d\\tau_z}{dz} \\frac{d}{d\\tau_z} = \\kappa_{\\nu} \\frac{d}{d\\tau_z}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the simplified RTE gives:\n$$\n\\mu \\left( \\kappa_{\\nu} \\frac{dI_{\\nu}(\\tau_z,\\mu)}{d\\tau_z} \\right) = -\\kappa_{\\nu} I_{\\nu}(\\tau_z,\\mu)\n$$\nDividing by the non-zero absorption coefficient $\\kappa_{\\nu}$, we obtain the RTE in terms of the optical depth variable $\\tau_z$:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{dI_{\\nu}}{d\\tau_z} = -I_{\\nu}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We are interested in the intensity propagating into the slab, for which the direction cosine is positive, i.e., $0 < \\mu \\leq 1$. For a fixed value of $\\mu$ in this range, we can separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dI_{\\nu}}{I_{\\nu}} = -\\frac{d\\tau_z}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis equation is solved by integrating along a characteristic path, which is a straight line defined by the direction cosine $\\mu$.

The incident specific intensity is given as $I_{\\nu,\\mathrm{inc}}(\\mu)$ for $0 < \\mu \\leq 1$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\nI_{\\nu}(0,\\mu) = I_{\\nu,\\mathrm{inc}}(\\mu)\n$$\nSubstituting this boundary condition into our general solution, we get:\n$$\nI_{\\nu}(\\tau_z,\\mu) = I_{\\nu,\\mathrm{inc}}(\\mu) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau_z}{\\mu}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the expression for the specific intensity at any point within the slab for any direction $\\mu > 0$.\n\nThe final step is to find the transmitted specific intensity, $I_{\\nu,\\mathrm{tr}}(\\mu)$, which is the intensity emerging from the far face of the slab. The far face is located at $z=L$. The corresponding optical depth is $\\tau_z(L) = \\kappa_{\\nu} L$. The problem defines this total optical thickness of the slab as $\\tau_{\\nu}$.\nSo, we evaluate our solution at the optical depth $\\tau_z = \\tau_{\\nu}$:\n$$\nI_{\\nu,\\mathrm{tr}}(\\mu) \\equiv I_{\\nu}(\\tau_{\\nu},\\mu) = I_{\\nu,\\mathrm{inc}}(\\mu) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau_{\\nu}}{\\mu}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is the well-known Beer-Lambert law, generalized for an arbitrary incident angular distribution and oblique paths through the slab. The term $\\tau_{\\nu}/\\mu$ represents the slant optical depth, which is the optical path length traveled by radiation propagating at an angle $\\theta=\\arccos(\\mu)$ through a slab of normal optical thickness $\\tau_{\\nu}$.

This is achieved by using the concept of the extrapolation length, $z_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ (or $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ in optical depth).\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the interior solution \"extrapolates linearly to zero\". An exponential solution, as would be found for the general case with $\\omega < 1$, does not extrapolate linearly. This phrasing guides us to use the result from the classic, conservative Milne problem where $\\omega=1$ (pure scattering). In this case, the source function is $S(\\tau)=J(\\tau)$, and the diffusion equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2J(\\tau)}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2} = 0\n$$\nThe solution is a linear function of $\\tau$: $J_{\\mathrm{asym}}(\\tau) = C_1 \\tau + C_2$.

For isotropic scattering, $q(\\infty)$ is a universal mathematical constant. The term $3H_0 q(\\infty)$ represents the offset between the exact solution's asymptote and the simple diffusion solution that would start from the origin.\n\nThe extrapolation length, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, is defined as the distance from the boundary at which this linear asymptotic solution extrapolates to zero. We set $J_{\\mathrm{asym}}(-\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}}) = 0$:\n$$\n3H_0 (-\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}} + q(\\infty)) = 0\n$$\nSince the flux $H_0$ is non-zero (otherwise the problem is trivial), we must have:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}} = q(\\infty)\n$$\nThe value of this universal Milne constant for isotropic scattering is $q(\\infty) \\approx 0.71044609...$. Rounding to six significant figures as requested, we use $q(\\infty) = 0.710446$.\n\nThis result, derived for the conservative case $\\omega=1$, is then used as a general boundary condition for the diffusion equation, even when $\\omega < 1$. The boundary condition is $J_{\\mathrm{asym}}(-\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}}) = 0$, or written in terms of physical length $z = \\tau/\\chi$, the asymptotic solution must vanish at $z = -z_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.\n\nTo find the extrapolation length in physical units, we convert from optical depth:\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}}}{\\chi} = \\frac{q(\\infty)}{\\chi}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\chi = \\kappa + \\sigma$ and the numerical value for $q(\\infty)$:\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\frac{0.710446}{\\kappa + \\sigma}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the result should be in centimeters, which implies that the units of the material properties $\\kappa$ and $\\sigma$ are $\\text{cm}^{-1}$, making the expression dimensionally correct for $z_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ in $\\text{cm}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the dependence of $z_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ on the single-scattering albedo $\\omega$. The derived expression is $z_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 0.710446 / \\chi$. The extinction coefficient $\\chi = \\kappa + \\sigma$ is the sum of the absorption and scattering coefficients. The single-scattering albedo is the ratio $\\omega = \\sigma / (\\kappa+\\sigma) = \\sigma / \\chi$.\n\nIn our derived expression, $z_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ depends only on the extinction coefficient $\\chi$. For a fixed value of $\\chi$ (i.e., for a fixed total mean free path $1/\\chi$), the value of $z_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is constant, regardless of how the extinction is partitioned between scattering and absorption (i.e., regardless of the value of $\\omega$). This lack of direct dependence on $\\omega$ is a direct consequence of using the solution to the conservative ($\\omega=1$) Milne problem to define the extrapolation length. This is a standard and widely used approximation, assuming that the transport physics in the thin boundary layer (on the order of one mean free path) is dominated by scattering and geometric effects, making the boundary condition insensitive to absorption. A more rigorous, but much more complex, analysis of the generalized Milne problem for $\\omega < 1$ would yield an extrapolation length that has a weak dependence on $\\omega$. However, based on the problem's explicit direction to find a linear extrapolation, the use of the universal constant from the conservative case is the intended path. Therefore, within this framework, the dependence of $z_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ on the specific properties of the medium is only through the total extinction coefficient $\\chi$.",
