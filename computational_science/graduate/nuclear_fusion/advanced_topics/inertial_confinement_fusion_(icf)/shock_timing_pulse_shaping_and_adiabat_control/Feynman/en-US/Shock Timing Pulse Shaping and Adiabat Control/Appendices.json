            "problem": "In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), the launch and timing of a strong initial shock by laser pulse shaping sets the fuel adiabat and strongly influences the achievable compression. Consider a planar, steady shock propagating into initially cold deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel that can be approximated as a monatomic ideal gas with ratio of specific heats $\\gamma = \\frac{5}{3}$. Let region $0$ denote the unshocked state and region $1$ the shocked state, and assume a strong-shock regime in which the upstream Mach number $M_0$ is asymptotically large, so that $P_1 \\gg P_0$ and the downstream thermodynamic state is dominated by the shock work rather than the upstream enthalpy. Starting from the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across a steady planar shock and the ideal-gas equation of state, derive the strong-shock-limit expression for the density compression ratio $\\rho_1 / \\rho_0$ as a function of $\\gamma$, and then evaluate it for the case $\\gamma = \\frac{5}{3}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the strong-shock-limit compression ratio for a monatomic ideal gas, starting from the fundamental conservation laws for a steady, planar shock. Let the unshocked upstream state be denoted by subscript $0$ and the shocked downstream state by subscript $1$. In the rest frame of the shock, the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across the shock front are given by the Rankine-Hugoniot relations:\n\n$1$. Conservation of mass:\n$$ \\rho_0 u_0 = \\rho_1 u_1 $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density and $u$ is the fluid velocity relative to the shock.\n\n$2$. Conservation of momentum:\n$$ P_0 + \\rho_0 u_0^2 = P_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 $$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure.\n\n$3$. Conservation of energy:\n$$ h_0 + \\frac{1}{2} u_0^2 = h_1 + \\frac{1}{2} u_1^2 $$\nwhere $h$ is the specific enthalpy.\n\nThe DT fuel is modeled as an ideal gas. For an ideal gas, the specific enthalpy $h$ is related to the specific internal energy $e$, pressure $P$, and density $\\rho$ by:\n$$ h = e + \\frac{P}{\\rho} $$\nThe specific internal energy for an ideal gas with a constant ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$ is given by $e = \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}\\frac{P}{\\rho}$. Therefore, the specific enthalpy is:\n$$ h = \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}\\frac{P}{\\rho} + \\frac{P}{\\rho} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\frac{P}{\\rho} $$\nA more convenient form of the energy conservation equation can be derived by combining the three conservation laws. Let's first rearrange the momentum equation:\n$$ P_1 - P_0 = \\rho_0 u_0^2 - \\rho_1 u_1^2 $$\nFrom mass conservation, we can write $u_0 = j/\\rho_0$ and $u_1 = j/\\rho_1$, where $j = \\rho_0 u_0$ is the constant mass flux. Substituting these into the momentum equation:\n$$ P_1 - P_0 = j (u_0 - u_1) $$\nNow, let's rearrange the energy equation and substitute for the velocities:\n$$ h_1 - h_0 = \\frac{1}{2} (u_0^2 - u_1^2) = \\frac{1}{2} (u_0 - u_1)(u_0 + u_1) $$\nUsing $u_0 - u_1 = (P_1 - P_0)/j$, we get:\n$$ h_1 - h_0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{P_1 - P_0}{j} (u_0 + u_1) $$\nSubstituting $u_0 = j/\\rho_0$ and $u_1 = j/\\rho_1$:\n$$ h_1 - h_0 = \\frac{1}{2} (P_1 - P_0) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_1}\\right) $$\nThis form of the energy equation is known as the Hugoniot relation. Now, we substitute the ideal gas expression for enthalpy:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{P_1}{\\rho_1} - \\frac{P_0}{\\rho_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (P_1 - P_0) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_1}\\right) $$\nWe are seeking the density compression ratio, $\\eta = \\rho_1 / \\rho_0$. Let's rewrite the equation in terms of $\\eta$ and the pressure ratio $P_r = P_1 / P_0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{P_1}{\\eta \\rho_0} - \\frac{P_0}{\\rho_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (P_1 - P_0) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} + \\frac{1}{\\eta \\rho_0}\\right) $$\nMultiplying through by $\\rho_0$ and dividing by $P_0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{P_1/P_0}{\\eta} - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0} - 1\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{P_r}{\\eta} - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (P_r - 1) \\left(\\frac{\\eta+1}{\\eta}\\right) $$\nMultiplying by $2\\eta(\\gamma-1)$:\n$$ 2\\gamma(P_r - \\eta) = (\\gamma-1)(P_r-1)(\\eta+1) $$\nWe expand and solve for the compression ratio $\\eta$:\n$$ 2\\gamma P_r - 2\\gamma\\eta = (\\gamma-1)(P_r\\eta + P_r - \\eta - 1) $$\n$$ 2\\gamma P_r - 2\\gamma\\eta = (\\gamma-1)P_r\\eta + (\\gamma-1)P_r - (\\gamma-1)\\eta - (\\gamma-1) $$\nGroup terms containing $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta [ (\\gamma-1)P_r - (\\gamma-1) + 2\\gamma ] = 2\\gamma P_r - (\\gamma-1)P_r + (\\gamma-1) $$\n$$ \\eta [ (\\gamma-1)P_r + (\\gamma+1) ] = (\\gamma+1)P_r + (\\gamma-1) $$\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{(\\gamma+1)P_r + (\\gamma-1)}{(\\gamma-1)P_r + (\\gamma+1)} $$\nThis is the general expression for the compression ratio across a shock in an ideal gas.\n\nThe problem specifies the strong-shock limit, characterized by an asymptotically large upstream Mach number, which implies that the pressure jump is very large, i.e., $P_1 \\gg P_0$, or $P_r = P_1/P_0 \\to \\infty$. To find the limit of our expression for $\\eta$, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $P_r$:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{(\\gamma+1) + (\\gamma-1)/P_r}{(\\gamma-1) + (\\gamma+1)/P_r} $$\nTaking the limit as $P_r \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{P_r \\to \\infty} \\eta = \\frac{(\\gamma+1) + 0}{(\\gamma-1) + 0} = \\frac{\\gamma+1}{\\gamma-1} $$\nThis is the strong-shock-limit expression for the density compression ratio as a function of $\\gamma$.\n\nThe problem states that the DT fuel is approximated as a monatomic ideal gas. For a monatomic gas, the ratio of specific heats is $\\gamma = \\frac{5}{3}$. We substitute this value into the derived expression:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{3} + 1}{\\frac{5}{3} - 1} $$\nThe numerator is $\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nThe denominator is $\\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nThus, the compression ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{8/3}{2/3} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 $$\nTherefore, in the strong-shock limit, a monatomic ideal gas is compressed by a factor of $4$.",

Therefore, for each bin $i$:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{abs,DT},i} = \\Phi_i \\cdot T_a(E_i) \\cdot \\left(1 - T_{\\text{DT}}(E_i)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $T_a(E_i) = \\exp\\!\\left[ -(\\mu/\\rho)_a(E_i) \\Sigma_a \\right]$ and $T_{\\text{DT}}(E_i) = \\exp\\!\\left[ -(\\mu/\\rho)_{\\text{DT}}(E_i) \\Sigma_{\\text{DT}} \\right]$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy-dependent mass attenuation coefficients for each bin using the given scaling laws:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{a}(E) = \\alpha_{a} E^{-3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{\\text{DT}}(E) = \\alpha_{\\text{DT}} E^{-3}\n$$\nwith $\\alpha_{a} = 1.50 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g \\cdot keV^3}$ and $\\alpha_{\\text{DT}} = 8.00 \\times 10^{2} \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g \\cdot keV^3}$.\n\nFor the first spectral bin ($i=1$):\nEnergy: $E_1 = 2.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$\nFraction: $f_1 = 0.70$\nIncident fluence: $\\Phi_1 = f_1 \\Phi = 0.70 \\times 0.250 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2} = 0.175 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2}$\nMass attenuation coefficients at $E_1$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{a}(E_1) = (1.50 \\times 10^{3}) \\ (2.00)^{-3} = \\frac{1500}{8} = 187.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g}\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{\\text{DT}}(E_1) = (8.00 \\times 10^{2}) \\ (2.00)^{-3} = \\frac{800}{8} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the optical depths (the exponents in the transmission formula):\nAblator optical depth: $\\tau_{a,1} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{a}(E_1) \\Sigma_{a} = 187.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g} \\times 0.020 \\ \\mathrm{g/cm^2} = 3.75$\nDT optical depth: $\\tau_{\\text{DT},1} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{\\text{DT}}(E_1) \\Sigma_{\\text{DT}} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g} \\times 0.00250 \\ \\mathrm{g/cm^2} = 0.25$\nThe energy absorbed from bin $1$:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{abs,DT},1} = \\Phi_1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\tau_{a,1}) \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\tau_{\\text{DT},1}))\n$$\n$$\nQ_{\\text{abs,DT},1} = 0.175 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2} \\cdot \\exp(-3.75) \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-0.25)) \\approx 0.00091062 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2}\n$$\n\nFor the second spectral bin ($i=2$):\nEnergy: $E_2 = 4.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$\nFraction: $f_2 = 0.30$\nIncident fluence: $\\Phi_2 = f_2 \\Phi = 0.30 \\times 0.250 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2} = 0.075 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2}$\nMass attenuation coefficients at $E_2$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{a}(E_2) = (1.50 \\times 10^{3}) \\ (4.00)^{-3} = \\frac{1500}{64} = 23.4375 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g}\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{\\text{DT}}(E_2) = (8.00 \\times 10^{2}) \\ (4.00)^{-3} = \\frac{800}{64} = 12.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g}\n$$\nOptical depths:\nAblator optical depth: $\\tau_{a,2} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{a}(E_2) \\Sigma_{a} = 23.4375 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g} \\times 0.020 \\ \\mathrm{g/cm^2} = 0.46875$\nDT optical depth: $\\tau_{\\text{DT},2} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)_{\\text{DT}}(E_2) \\Sigma_{\\text{DT}} = 12.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/g} \\times 0.00250 \\ \\mathrm{g/cm^2} = 0.03125$\nThe energy absorbed from bin $2$:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{abs,DT},2} = \\Phi_2 \\cdot \\exp(-\\tau_{a,2}) \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\tau_{\\text{DT},2}))\n$$\n$$\nQ_{\\text{abs,DT},2} = 0.075 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2} \\cdot \\exp(-0.46875) \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-0.03125)) \\approx 0.00144440 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2}\n$$\n\nThe total absorbed energy per unit area in the DT layer is the sum:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{abs,DT}} = Q_{\\text{abs,DT},1} + Q_{\\text{abs,DT},2} \\approx 0.00091062 + 0.00144440 = 0.00235502 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2}\n$$\nNext, we find the specific absorbed energy, $q$:\n$$\nq = \\frac{Q_{\\text{abs,DT}}}{\\Sigma_{\\text{DT}}} = \\frac{0.00235502 \\ \\mathrm{J/cm^2}}{0.00250 \\ \\mathrm{g/cm^2}} \\approx 0.942008 \\ \\mathrm{J/g}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the temperature rise $\\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{q}{c_{v}} = \\frac{0.942008 \\ \\mathrm{J/g}}{7.50 \\ \\mathrm{J/(g \\cdot K)}} \\approx 0.125601 \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta T \\approx 0.126 \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$",
