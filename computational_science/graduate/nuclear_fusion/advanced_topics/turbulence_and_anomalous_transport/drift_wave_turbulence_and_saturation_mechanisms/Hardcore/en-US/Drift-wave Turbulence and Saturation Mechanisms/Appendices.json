            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of several key quantities related to a drift wave in a magnetized slab plasma. We will perform these calculations step-by-step, starting from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ion cyclotron frequency, $\\Omega_i$. For a singly charged ion with mass $m_i$ and charge $q_i = e$ in a magnetic field of magnitude $B$, this frequency is given by:\n$$\n\\Omega_i = \\frac{e B}{m_i}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided values: the elementary charge $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ C, the magnetic field $B = 2.0$ T, and the mass of a deuterium ion $m_i = 3.345 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg:\n$$\n\\Omega_i = \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}) \\times (2.0 \\text{ T})}{3.345 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}} \\approx 9.5795 \\times 10^7 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the ion sound speed, $c_s$. As specified, this speed is derived from the electron thermal energy and the ion mass:\n$$\nc_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e}{m_i}}\n$$\nThe electron temperature $T_e$ is given in kiloelectron-volts ($keV$) and must be converted to Joules (J) for use in SI unit calculations. Using the conversion $1$ eV $= 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ J:\n$$\nT_e = 1.2 \\text{ keV} = 1.2 \\times 10^3 \\text{ eV} \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}) = 1.92261196 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}\n$$\nNow, we can compute $c_s$:\n$$\nc_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.92261196 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}}{3.345 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}}} \\approx 2.3974 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}\n$$\n\nThird, using the two quantities above, we compute the ion sound gyroradius, $\\rho_s$. This is the characteristic length scale defined by the ratio of the ion sound speed to the ion cyclotron frequency:\n$$\n\\rho_s = \\frac{c_s}{\\Omega_i}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can express $\\rho_s$ directly in terms of the fundamental parameters:\n$$\n\\rho_s = \\frac{\\sqrt{T_e / m_i}}{e B / m_i} = \\frac{\\sqrt{T_e m_i}}{e B}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $c_s$ and $\\Omega_i$:\n$$\n\\rho_s = \\frac{2.3974 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}}{9.5795 \\times 10^7 \\text{ s}^{-1}} \\approx 2.5027 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}\n$$\n\nFourth, we derive and compute the electron diamagnetic drift frequency, $\\omega_{*e}$. This frequency is the Doppler shift, $k_y v_{de,y}$, associated with the electron diamagnetic drift velocity, $\\mathbf{v}_{de}$, for a wave with binormal wavenumber $k_y$. The drift velocity is caused by the plasma pressure gradient in a magnetic field:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{de} = -\\frac{\\nabla p_e \\times \\mathbf{B}}{e n_e B^2}\n$$\nAssuming the electron temperature $T_e$ is uniform, the pressure gradient simplifies to $\\nabla p_e = T_e \\nabla n_e$. The density gradient is characterized by the scale length $L_n = |\\nabla \\ln n_0|^{-1} = n_0 / |\\nabla n_0|$. For a gradient in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ direction, $\\nabla n_e = (n_e/L_n)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. With $\\mathbf{B} = B \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the velocity is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{de} = -\\frac{T_e (n_e/L_n) \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times B \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{e n_e B^2} = -\\frac{T_e}{e B L_n} (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\frac{T_e}{e B L_n} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nThe diamagnetic frequency $\\omega_{*e}$ is then:\n$$\n\\omega_{*e} = k_y v_{de,y} = \\frac{k_y T_e}{e B L_n}\n$$\nSubstituting the given parameters, with $T_e$ in Joules:\n$$\n\\omega_{*e} = \\frac{(180 \\text{ m}^{-1}) \\times (1.92261196 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J})}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}) \\times (2.0 \\text{ T}) \\times (0.20 \\text{ m})} = 5.4000 \\times 10^5 \\text{ s}^{-1}\n$$\nNote that since $T_e[\\text{J}] = T_e[\\text{eV}] \\times e[\\text{C/V}]$, the factor of $e$ cancels, simplifying the numerical calculation to $\\omega_{*e} = k_y T_e[\\text{eV}] / (B L_n) = (180 \\times 1.2 \\times 10^3) / (2.0 \\times 0.20) = 5.4 \\times 10^5$.\n\nFinally, we assess consistency with the drift-wave ordering by calculating the required dimensionless metrics.\nThe standard drift-wave ordering requires the wave frequency $\\omega$ to be much smaller than the ion cyclotron frequency $\\Omega_i$, and the perpendicular spatial scale (inversely proportional to $k_y$) to be larger than the ion gyroradius scale $\\rho_s$.\n1. The frequency ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega}{\\Omega_i} = \\frac{4.20 \\times 10^5 \\text{ s}^{-1}}{9.5795 \\times 10^7 \\text{ s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.00438\n$$\nThis ratio is much less than $1$, satisfying the low-frequency condition $\\omega \\ll \\Omega_i$.\n\n2. The wavenumber-gyroradius product:\n$$\nk_y \\rho_s = (180 \\text{ m}^{-1}) \\times (2.5027 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}) \\approx 0.450\n$$\nThis value is less than $1$, consistent with the condition $k_y \\rho_s < 1$ for typical drift waves.\n\n3. The ratio of the measured frequency to the diamagnetic frequency, $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{*e}}\n$$\nThis ratio is a key parameter determining the wave dynamics. In the simplest linear theory of drift waves, $\\omega \\approx \\omega_{*e}$, which implies $R \\approx 1$. We compute its value for the given experimental observations:\n$$\nR = \\frac{4.20 \\times 10^5 \\text{ s}^{-1}}{5.40 \\times 10^5 \\text{ s}^{-1}} = \\frac{42}{54} = \\frac{7}{9} \\approx 0.7777\\ldots\n$$\nThe value $R \\approx 0.7778$ is of order unity, which is fully consistent with the mode being a drift wave whose frequency is primarily determined by the electron diamagnetic drift. The deviation from unity indicates the influence of other physical effects not included in the simplest model, such as ion dynamics or finite Larmor radius effects, which introduce a real frequency shift.\n\nThe requested final answer is the value of $R$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 0.7778\n$$",
