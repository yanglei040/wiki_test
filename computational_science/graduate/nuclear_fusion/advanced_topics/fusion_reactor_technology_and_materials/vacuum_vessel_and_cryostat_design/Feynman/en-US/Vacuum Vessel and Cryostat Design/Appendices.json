            "problem": "A toroidal nuclear fusion vacuum system consists of a vacuum vessel thermally cycled between a high-temperature bakeout and a lower-temperature operation, and a surrounding cryostat maintained near cryogenic temperature. The neutral gas is in the free-molecular regime and is well described by the assumptions of kinetic theory and the ideal gas model. The design requirement is that the neutral number density in the plasma region of the vacuum vessel be maintained at a specified value $n$, with the dominant residual species having molecular mass $m$. The vacuum vessel temperature is $T_{b}$ during bakeout and $T_{o}$ during operation. Pressure is equilibrated throughout the connected volumes, independent of local temperature gradients.\n\nStarting from first principles of kinetic theory and thermodynamic equipartition (do not invoke any pre-derived target relations), derive the pressure in terms of the neutral number density and temperature in the vacuum vessel. Then, using the derived relation, calculate the pressure needed to meet the requirement at bakeout and at operation. Finally, report the ratio of the required pressure at bakeout to that at operation, and discuss the sensitivity of the required pressure to temperature in both conditions, including the role (if any) of the gas species mass $m$.\n\nUse the following parameter values:\n- Required neutral number density: $n = 5.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n- Dominant gas species: deuterium molecule ($\\text{D}_2$) with molecular mass $m = 6.70 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Bakeout temperature: $T_{b} = 550\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Operation temperature: $T_{o} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_{B} = 1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$.\n\nAssume the International System of Units (SI) throughout.

            "solution": "The gas is in the free-molecular regime, and we model it as an ideal gas governed by kinetic theory. The pressure $P$ exerted by a gas on a wall can be derived from the momentum flux of particles. In kinetic theory, the isotropic momentum flux yields\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{3} n m \\overline{v^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density, $m$ is the particle mass, and $\\overline{v^{2}}$ is the mean square speed.\n\nThe relation between the mean kinetic energy of a particle and the thermodynamic temperature $T$ follows from the equipartition theorem for translational degrees of freedom:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m \\overline{v^{2}} = \\frac{3}{2} k_{B} T.\n$$\nSolving for $m \\overline{v^{2}}$ and substituting into the expression for $P$ gives\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{3} n \\left(3 k_{B} T\\right) = n k_{B} T.\n$$\nThus, the pressure required to achieve a specified number density $n$ at temperature $T$ is\n$$\nP(T) = n k_{B} T.\n$$\nAn important point is that the explicit dependence on the molecular mass $m$ cancels when invoking equipartition to connect $\\overline{v^{2}}$ to $T$. Therefore, for a given $n$ and $T$, the required equilibrium pressure $P$ is insensitive to $m$ in this ideal-gas, equilibrium context.\n\nWe now compute the pressures at bakeout and operation using the given numerical parameters. Keep symbols until the final numerical evaluation:\n$$\nP_{b} = n k_{B} T_{b}, \\quad P_{o} = n k_{B} T_{o}.\n$$\nThe ratio simplifies to\n$$\nR = \\frac{P_{b}}{P_{o}} = \\frac{n k_{B} T_{b}}{n k_{B} T_{o}} = \\frac{T_{b}}{T_{o}}.\n$$\nEvaluate numerically:\n- First, the proportionality $n k_{B}$:\n$$\nn k_{B} = \\left(5.0 \\times 10^{15}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} \\times \\left(1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{J/K} = 6.903\\,245 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa/K}.\n$$\n- Bakeout pressure:\n$$\nP_{b} = \\left(6.903\\,245 \\times 10^{-8}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{Pa/K} \\times \\left(550\\,\\mathrm{K}\\right) = 3.796\\,784\\,75 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}.\n$$\n- Operation pressure:\n$$\nP_{o} = \\left(6.903\\,245 \\times 10^{-8}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{Pa/K} \\times \\left(300\\,\\mathrm{K}\\right) = 2.070\\,973\\,50 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}.\n$$\n- Ratio:\n$$\nR = \\frac{P_{b}}{P_{o}} = \\frac{550}{300} = \\frac{11}{6} \\approx 1.833\\,333\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures:\n$$\nR \\approx 1.833.\n$$\n\nSensitivity to temperature:\n- The absolute sensitivity is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} = n k_{B},\n$$\nwhich is constant for fixed $n$.

These influence how fast equilibrium is reached and how efficiently cryogenic surfaces in the cryostat remove gas, but they do not change the equilibrium ideal-gas relation linking $P$, $n$, and $T$.\n- In a connected vacuum vessel–cryostat system at the same equilibrium pressure, the local number density is $n(x) = P/\\left(k_{B} T(x)\\right)$, so colder cryostat regions have higher $n$ for the same $P$. In practice, cryosorption and condensation at cryogenic temperatures further reduce $P$ below the ideal-gas estimate by removing particles from the gas phase, with efficiency depending on $m$ through sticking and desorption kinetics. Those effects are beyond the present equilibrium ideal-gas calculation but are central to detailed cryostat pumping performance.\n\nTherefore, to maintain a specified neutral number density $n$ in the vacuum vessel, the required equilibrium pressure $P$ scales linearly with the vessel temperature $T$. Between bakeout and operation, the ratio of required pressures is simply the ratio of temperatures.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information to perform a steady-state analysis of the two-region vacuum system. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis is based on the principle of mass conservation in a steady-state vacuum system, where gas flow is quantified by throughput $Q$ (in units of $\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$). For any isolated volume at steady state, the total throughput of gas entering the volume must equal the total throughput leaving it.\n\n**1. Derivation of Steady-State Pressures $p_1$ and $p_2$**\n\nLet $p_1$ and $p_2$ be the steady-state pressures in region $1$ and region $2$, respectively. Let $Q_{2 \\to 1}$ be the net throughput of gas flowing from region $2$ to region $1$ through the duct.\n\n**Analysis of Region 2:**\nThe only source of gas in region $2$ is outgassing, with a total throughput of $G_2$. The only sink for this gas is the flow through the duct into region $1$. The mass conservation equation for region $2$ is:\n$$G_2 = Q_{2 \\to 1}$$\nThe throughput through the duct is defined by its molecular-flow conductance $C$ and the pressure difference across it:\n$$Q_{2 \\to 1} = C (p_2 - p_1)$$\nSince the gas source $G_2$ is in region $2$ and the pump is in region $1$, we must have $p_2 > p_1$. Combining these two equations gives our first governing relation:\n$$G_2 = C (p_2 - p_1) \\quad (1)$$\n\n**Analysis of Region 1:**\nThe sources of gas in region $1$ are its own outgassing, $G_1$, and the gas flowing in from region $2$, $Q_{2 \\to 1}$. The only sink is the pump array, which removes gas at a throughput of $Q_p$. The mass conservation equation for region $1$ is:\n$$G_1 + Q_{2 \\to 1} = Q_p$$\nThe throughput removed by a pump is defined by its effective pumping speed $S$ and the pressure at its inlet, $p_1$:\n$$Q_p = S p_1$$\nCombining these gives our second governing relation:\n$$G_1 + Q_{2 \\to 1} = S p_1 \\quad (2)$$\n\n**Solving for $p_1$ and $p_2$:**\nWe have a system of two algebraic equations. From equation $(1)$, we have $Q_{2 \\to 1} = G_2$. Substituting this into equation $(2)$:\n$$G_1 + G_2 = S p_1$$\nThis allows us to solve for $p_1$:\n$$p_1 = \\frac{G_1 + G_2}{S}$$\nThis result is physically intuitive: the pressure at the pump inlet is determined by the total gas load ($G_1 + G_2$) divided by the pumping speed.\n\nNow we can solve for $p_2$ using equation $(1)$:\n$$p_2 - p_1 = \\frac{G_2}{C}$$\n$$p_2 = p_1 + \\frac{G_2}{C} = \\frac{G_1 + G_2}{S} + \\frac{G_2}{C}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nUsing the given values:\n$G_1 = 0.05\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$G_2 = 0.20\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$S = 1000\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$C = 10\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$p_1 = \\frac{0.05\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1} + 0.20\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{1000\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.25}{1000}\\,\\text{Pa} = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n$$p_2 = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa} + \\frac{0.20\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{10\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa} + 0.02\\,\\text{Pa} = 0.02025\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n\n**2. Definition and Calculation of Vessel-Average Pressure $p_{\\text{avg}}$**\n\nA physically meaningful average pressure is one that reflects the total number of gas molecules in the entire volume. Assuming a uniform temperature $T$ throughout the system, the number of molecules $N$ in a volume $V$ at pressure $p$ is given by the ideal gas law, $N = pV/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The total number of molecules is $N_{\\text{total}} = N_1 + N_2$. The vessel-average pressure $p_{\\text{avg}}$ is the pressure that would exist if the total number of molecules $N_{\\text{total}}$ were uniformly distributed over the total volume $V_{\\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2$.\n$$p_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{total}} k_B T}{V_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{(N_1 + N_2) k_B T}{V_1 + V_2} = \\frac{p_1 V_1 + p_2 V_2}{V_1 + V_2}$$\nThis is the volume-weighted average of the pressures.\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nUsing the given volumes $V_1 = 80\\,\\text{m}^3$ and $V_2 = 120\\,\\text{m}^3$, and our calculated pressures:\n$$p_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{(80\\,\\text{m}^3)(0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}) + (120\\,\\text{m}^3)(0.02025\\,\\text{Pa})}{80\\,\\text{m}^3 + 120\\,\\text{m}^3}$$\n$$p_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{0.02\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3 + 2.43\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3}{200\\,\\text{m}^3} = \\frac{2.45\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3}{200\\,\\text{m}^3} = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n\n**3. Assessment of Gauge Placement and Inference Method**\nThe pressure measured in region $1$ is $p_1 = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}$, while the pressure in region $2$ is $p_2 = 0.02025\\,\\text{Pa}$, nearly two orders of magnitude higher. The vessel-average pressure is $p_{\\text{avg}} = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$. The gauge near the pump in region $1$ measures a pressure that is drastically lower than both the pressure in region $2$ and the vessel-average pressure. This highlights the critical impact of conductance limitations: a local pressure measurement near a strong pump can be highly misleading for the overall vacuum state of a complex, partitioned vessel.\n\nTo infer $p_{\\text{avg}}$ from a measurement of $p_1$ alone, one must know the system parameters $S$, $C$, $G_1$, $V_1$, and $V_2$. The key is to first infer the state of the unmeasured region. The throughput from region $2$ into region $1$ can be inferred from the mass balance in region $1$: $Q_{2 \\to 1} = S p_1 - G_1$. Let's denote this inferred throughput by $Q_{inf}$. Then, one can infer the pressure drop across the duct: $p_2 - p_1 = Q_{inf}/C$. This allows calculation of $p_2$. Finally, $p_{\\text{avg}}$ can be calculated using the volume-weighted average formula.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Using the governing relations for molecular flow and steady-state throughput conservation, the pressure difference between the regions is $p_2 - p_1 = G_2/C$, the pump-side pressure is $p_1 = (G_1 + G_2)/S$, and the vessel-average pressure is $p_{\\text{avg}} = (V_1 p_1 + V_2 p_2)/(V_1 + V_2) \\approx 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$ for the given parameters.**\nThis statement presents the three key results of the steady-state analysis. Our derivation confirms that $p_2 - p_1 = G_2/C$ (from eq. 1), $p_1 = (G_1 + G_2)/S$ (from rearranging $S p_1 = G_1 + G_2$), and the definition of average pressure is correct. Our calculation yielded $p_{\\text{avg}} = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$. Every part of this statement is accurate and derived directly from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because the pump strongly evacuates the vessel, the gauge near the pump reads a value representative of the entire vessel, so $p_{\\text{avg}} \\approx p_1$ even in the presence of a conductance-limited connection to region $2$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While the pump is strong ($S = 1000\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$), its effect is localized by the small conductance of the duct ($C = 10\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$). Our calculations show $p_1 = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}$ and $p_{\\text{avg}} = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$. These values are not approximately equal; they differ by a factor of about $50$. The presence of a conductance-limited connection is precisely why $p_1$ is *not* representative of the average pressure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If only the gauge in region $1$ is available, an unbiased estimate of the vessel-average pressure can be formed as $p_{\\text{avg}} \\approx p_1 + \\dfrac{V_2}{V_1 + V_2}\\,\\dfrac{Q_{12}}{C}$, where $Q_{12}$ is the duct throughput inferred from $p_1$ using $Q_{12} = S p_1 - G_1$; for the given parameters this yields $p_{\\text{avg}} \\approx 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$.**\nThis statement describes the inference procedure. Let's verify the formula for $p_{\\text{avg}}$. Substituting $p_2 = p_1 + Q_{12}/C$ (where $Q_{12}$ is the net throughput $Q_{2 \\to 1}$) into the definition of $p_{\\text{avg}}$:\n$p_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{p_1 V_1 + (p_1 + Q_{12}/C) V_2}{V_1 + V_2} = \\frac{p_1(V_1+V_2) + (Q_{12}/C)V_2}{V_1+V_2} = p_1 + \\frac{V_2}{V_1+V_2} \\frac{Q_{12}}{C}$.\nThe formula is correct. The method for inferring the throughput, $Q_{12} = S p_1 - G_1$, is also correct as derived from the mass balance for region $1$. Finally, let's verify the calculation. From our results, $p_1=0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}$.\n$Q_{12} = (1000\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1})(0.00025\\,\\text{Pa}) - 0.05\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.25 - 0.05 = 0.20\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$p_{\\text{avg}} = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa} + \\frac{120}{80+120} \\frac{0.20\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{10\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.00025\\,\\text{Pa} + (0.6)(0.02\\,\\text{Pa}) = 0.00025 + 0.012 = 0.01225\\,\\text{Pa}$. The calculation is correct. The statement accurately describes a valid inference procedure and gives the correct result.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. A throughput-weighted average $p_w = \\dfrac{S p_1 + C p_1}{S + C}$ equals the vessel-average pressure in molecular flow networks and can be used to infer $p_{\\text{avg}}$ from a single gauge near the pump.**\nThe proposed formula algebraically simplifies to $p_w = \\frac{p_1(S + C)}{S + C} = p_1$. The statement is thus equivalent to claiming $p_{\\text{avg}} = p_1$. As established in the analysis of option B, this is false. The proposed definition of a \"throughput-weighted average\" is not physically meaningful for calculating the vessel-average pressure and is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Placing both gauges in the same compartment eliminates bias caused by conductance limitations, and the vessel-average pressure can be obtained as the arithmetic mean $p_{\\text{avg}} = (p_1 + p_2)/2$ regardless of the volumes and duct conductance.**\nThis statement contains two false claims. First, placing both gauges in one compartment does not eliminate bias; it makes it impossible to measure the pressure in the other compartment, thus preventing a direct calculation of $p_{\\text{avg}}$. Second, the average pressure is the volume-weighted mean, not the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean $(p_1 + p_2)/2$ is only correct if the volumes are equal ($V_1 = V_2$), which is not the case here ($V_1 = 80\\,\\text{m}^3$, $V_2 = 120\\,\\text{m}^3$). The claim that this works \"regardless of the volumes\" is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

The problem is well-posed, with a clear initial condition and a governing physical principle (conservation of mass) from which a solvable differential equation can be derived. All parameters are provided with consistent physical units and are of a realistic magnitude for a large-scale fusion experiment. The problem is objective and free of ambiguities.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\nThe derivation begins with the conservation of mass for the gas contained within the volume $V$. According to the ideal gas law, the number of gas molecules $N$ in the volume $V$ at pressure $P$ and temperature $T$ is given by $P V = N k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Since $V$ and $T$ are constant, the rate of change of the number of molecules is $\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{V}{k_B T}\\frac{dP}{dt}$.\n\nThe principle of mass conservation states that the rate of change of the number of molecules in the volume is equal to the rate of molecules entering minus the rate of molecules leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\Phi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\Phi_{\\mathrm{out}}\n$$\nThe gas influx $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is due to surface outgassing. The total outgassing throughput (gas load) is $Q_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) = A\\,q(t)$. The corresponding molecular flow rate is $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{in}} = Q_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) / (k_B T)$.\nThe gas outflux $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is due to the vacuum pump. The throughput removed by the pump is $Q_{\\mathrm{pump}}(t) = P(t)S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The corresponding molecular flow rate is $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{out}} = P(t)S_{\\mathrm{eff}} / (k_B T)$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the conservation equation:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{k_B T}\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \\frac{A\\,q(t)}{k_B T} - \\frac{P(t)S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{k_B T}\n$$\nThe term $k_B T$ cancels, which is expected as vacuum dynamics are often described using throughput balance, assuming an isothermal system. This yields the standard pressure-rate equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = A\\,q(t) - P(t)S_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given form of $q(t)$:\n$$\nV \\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \\frac{A q_{0}}{1 + t/t_{c}} - P(t)S_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nThis is the governing dynamical equation for $P(t)$. To facilitate its solution, we rearrange it into the standard form of a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, $\\frac{dy}{dx} + f(x)y = g(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} + \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{V} P(t) = \\frac{A q_{0}}{V} \\frac{1}{1 + t/t_{c}}\n$$\nWe identify the characteristic pumping time constant of the system as $\\tau_p = V/S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_p} P(t) = \\frac{A q_{0}}{V} \\frac{t_c}{t + t_c}\n$$\n\n**Analytic Solution**\nThis linear ODE can be solved using an integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{1}{\\tau_p} dt\\right) = \\exp(t/\\tau_p)$. The general solution is:\n$$\nP(t) = \\exp(-t/\\tau_p) \\left[ \\int \\exp(t/\\tau_p) \\left( \\frac{A q_{0}}{V} \\frac{t_c}{t + t_c} \\right) dt + C \\right]\n$$\nThe integral does not have an elementary form and is solved in terms of the exponential integral function, $\\mathrm{Ei}(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{\\exp(u)}{u}du$. The full solution, after applying the initial condition $P(0) = P_i$, is:\n$$\nP(t) = P_i \\exp(-t/\\tau_p) + \\frac{A q_{0} t_c}{V} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t+t_c}{\\tau_p}\\right) \\left[ \\mathrm{Ei}\\left(\\frac{t+t_c}{\\tau_p}\\right) - \\mathrm{Ei}\\left(\\frac{t_c}{\\tau_p}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression is the exact analytic solution.\n\n**Simplified Expression via Timescale Analysis**\nThe problem asks for a reduced expression based on physical arguments. We compare the characteristic timescales:\n- Pumping time constant: $\\tau_p = \\frac{V}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{350\\,\\mathrm{m}^3}{3.00\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 116.7\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Outgassing time constant: $t_c = 3600\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nWe observe that $\\tau_p \\ll t_c$. This indicates that the pumping system can remove gas much faster than the rate at which the outgassing source itself decays.\nThe first term in the solution, $P_i \\exp(-t/\\tau_p)$, represents the pumpdown of the initial gas volume. This term decays rapidly, becoming negligible for times $t \\gg \\tau_p$ (e.g., after a few minutes). The subsequent pressure evolution is governed by the much slower outgassing process.\nFor $t \\gg \\tau_p$, the term $V \\frac{dP}{dt}$ in the governing equation becomes small compared to the outgassing and pumping terms. This leads to a quasi-static equilibrium where the pumping throughput approximately balances the outgassing throughput:\n$$\nP(t)S_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx A\\,q(t)\n$$\nThis approximation is valid as long as the change in pressure happens on a timescale much longer than $\\tau_p$, which is true here because the driving term $q(t)$ evolves on the scale of $t_c$.\nThe reduced expression for pressure in this outgassing-dominated regime is:\n$$\nP(t) \\approx \\frac{A q_{0}}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\frac{1}{1 + t/t_{c}}\n$$\nWe must verify that this approximation is suitable for finding the time to reach $P_b$. At $t=0$, the outgassing establishes a quasi-static pressure floor of $P_{\\mathrm{qs}}(0) = \\frac{A q_0}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1200 \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}}{3.00} = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. Since the target pressure $P_b = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ is below this value, the time to reach it will be determined by the decay of the outgassing source, and the system will be well within the outgassing-dominated regime. The initial pumpdown from $P_i=1.00\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ to near $0.04\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ is very rapid and its duration is negligible compared to the total time to reach $P_b$.\n\n**Calculation of Time to Reach Base Pressure**\nWe use the simplified expression to find the time $t_b$ at which $P(t_b) = P_b$:\n$$\nP_b = \\frac{A q_{0}}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\frac{1}{1 + t_b/t_{c}}\n$$\nSolving for $t_b$:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{t_b}{t_c} = \\frac{A q_{0}}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}} P_b}\n$$\n$$\nt_b = t_c \\left( \\frac{A q_{0}}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}} P_b} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\frac{A q_{0}}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}} P_b} = \\frac{(1200\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) (1.00\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2})}{(3.00\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (1.00\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{Pa})} = \\frac{0.120}{0.0300} = 4.00\n$$\nThe dimensionless quantity is exact to the precision of the inputs. Now we calculate $t_b$:\n$$\nt_b = (3600\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\left( 4.00 - 1 \\right) = (3600\\,\\mathrm{s})(3.00) = 10800\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in hours, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nt_b (\\text{hours}) = \\frac{10800\\,\\mathrm{s}}{3600\\,\\mathrm{s/h}} = 3.00\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$",
