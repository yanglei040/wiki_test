We will derive this quantity starting from fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $N$ be the number density of atoms in the material (atoms per unit volume, e.g., $\\text{atoms}/\\text{cm}^3$).\nLet $\\phi$ be the incident monoenergetic neutron flux (neutrons per unit area per unit time, e.g., $\\text{neutrons}/\\text{cm}^2\\text{s}$).\nLet $\\kappa$ be the microscopic displacement cross-section for a neutron of the given energy (area per atom, e.g., $\\text{cm}^2$). This cross-section represents the effective target area of a single atom for an interaction that leads to a displacement cascade.\n\nThe macroscopic displacement cross-section, $\\Sigma_{\\text{d}}$, is defined as the product of the atom number density $N$ and the microscopic displacement cross-section $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\Sigma_{\\text{d}} = N \\kappa $$\n$\\Sigma_{\\text{d}}$ has units of inverse length (e.g., $\\text{cm}^{-1}$) and represents the probability of a displacement-causing interaction per unit path length of a neutron through the material.\n\nThe rate of displacement events per unit volume, $R_{\\text{d}}$, is given by the product of the macroscopic displacement cross-section and the neutron flux:\n$$ R_{\\text{d}} = \\Sigma_{\\text{d}} \\phi = N \\kappa \\phi $$\n$R_{\\text{d}}$ has units of displacement events per unit volume per unit time (e.g., $\\text{displacements}/\\text{cm}^3\\text{s}$).\n\nTo find the total number of displacements, $N_{\\text{disp}}$, that occur in a specific volume $V$ of the material over an exposure time $t$, we multiply the rate density by the volume and the time (assuming the flux and cross-section are constant):\n$$ N_{\\text{disp}} = R_{\\text{d}} V t = (N \\kappa \\phi) V t $$\n\nThe total number of atoms, $N_{\\text{atom}}$, in that same volume $V$ is given by:\n$$ N_{\\text{atom}} = N V $$\n\nBy definition, the DPA is the ratio of the total number of displacements to the total number of atoms:\n$$ \\text{DPA} = \\frac{N_{\\text{disp}}}{N_{\\text{atom}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{\\text{disp}}$ and $N_{\\text{atom}}$:\n$$ \\text{DPA} = \\frac{(N \\kappa \\phi) V t}{N V} $$\nThe atom density $N$ and the arbitrary volume $V$ cancel, yielding the final expression for DPA:\n$$ \\text{DPA} = \\kappa \\phi t $$\nThis derived expression confirms that DPA is a dimensionless quantity, as the units of area ($\\kappa$) are cancelled by the units of area in the flux ($\\phi$), and the units of time ($t$) are cancelled by the units of time in the flux ($\\phi$).\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Annual DPA**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nNeutron flux, $\\phi = 2 \\times 10^{14}\\ \\text{cm}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nDisplacement cross-section, $\\kappa = 300\\ \\text{barn}$.\nExposure time, $t = 1\\ \\text{year}$.\n\nBefore using the derived formula, we must ensure all units are consistent.

This is a well-established concept in physical metallurgy and nuclear materials science. The model for dislocation bowing between obstacles (Orowan bowing, or more generally, dispersed barrier hardening) is a fundamental principle. The values provided are typical for this class of materials. Fe-9Cr steels are indeed a primary candidate for fusion structural materials. The BCC structure, Burgers vector, shear modulus, and Taylor factor are all physically reasonable. The obstacle density is also within the range observed in experiments.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n3.  **Solution Phase**:\n    *   **Part 1: Derivation of the functional dependence**.\n        *   The core concept is dispersed barrier hardening. An edge or screw dislocation line bows out between obstacles under an applied shear stress $\\tau$.\n        *   The force on the dislocation line per unit length is $F/L = \\tau b$.\n        *   The obstacles exert a pinning force on the dislocation. The dislocation will break through or bypass the obstacles when the applied force is sufficient to overcome the pinning force.\n        *   The model relates the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS), $\\tau_c$, to the properties of the obstacle field.\n        *   The average distance between obstacles on the slip plane, $L$, is related to the areal density $N_d$. For a random distribution of point obstacles, the average spacing is typically given by $L = 1/\\sqrt{N_d}$.\n        *   When a dislocation bows out between two pinning points separated by a distance $L$, it forms an arc. The force balance at the point of breaking away from the obstacle is key.\n        *   The resistive force from the line tension of the dislocation is related to its curvature. The line tension, $T$, is approximately $\\mu b^2 / 2$.\n        *   The force from the applied stress over the segment of length $L$ is $\\tau b L$. This force is balanced by the components of the line tension at the pinning points.\n        *   The critical condition for bypassing the obstacles occurs when the dislocation bows into a semicircle. Let's reconsider the general \"friedel statistics\" or \"dispersed barrier\" model.\n        *   The increase in the critical resolved shear stress, $\\Delta \\tau_{\\text{CRSS}}$, due to a random array of obstacles is given by the general form:\n            $$ \\Delta \\tau_{\\text{CRSS}} = \\alpha \\mu b \\sqrt{N_d} $$\n        *   Let's check the origin of this formula. The force balance at a pinning point relates the applied stress $\\tau$ to the line tension $T$ and the bowing angle. For weak, randomly distributed obstacles, Friedel's statistics apply, leading to $\\Delta \\tau \\propto N_d^{1/2}$. For strong obstacles, the Orowan mechanism gives $\\Delta \\tau \\propto 1/L \\propto N_d^{1/2}$. So, the $N_d^{1/2}$ dependence is robust. The pre-factor contains the physics.\n        *   The equation $\\Delta \\tau_{\\text{CRSS}} = \\alpha \\mu b \\sqrt{N_d}$ is a standard form for dispersed barrier hardening, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant accounting for the obstacle strength and statistical averaging over random distributions. For impenetrable Orowan obstacles, $\\alpha$ is typically in the range of $0.8-1.0$ depending on the screw/edge character and averaging method. For weaker, shearable obstacles, $\\alpha$ is smaller, which is consistent with the given value $\\alpha = 0.25$. So this equation is the correct starting point.\n\n    *   **Part 2: Connecting to macroscopic yield stress**.\n        *   The critical resolved shear stress, $\\Delta \\tau_{\\text{CRSS}}$, is the stress required to move dislocations on a single, optimally oriented slip system.\n        *   Macroscopic yielding in a polycrystalline material requires accommodating deformation across many grains with different crystallographic orientations relative to the applied stress axis.\n        *   The Taylor factor, $M$, provides the link between the macroscopic tensile yield stress, $\\sigma_y$, and the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{\\text{CRSS}}$.\n        *   $\\sigma_y = M \\tau_{\\text{CRSS}}$.\n        *   Therefore, the increase in yield stress, $\\Delta \\sigma_y$, due to the irradiation-induced obstacles is related to the increase in CRSS, $\\Delta \\tau_{\\text{CRSS}}$, by the same factor:\n            $$ \\Delta \\sigma = M \\Delta \\tau_{\\text{CRSS}} $$\n        *   Substituting the expression for $\\Delta \\tau_{\\text{CRSS}}$:\n            $$ \\Delta \\sigma = M (\\alpha \\mu b \\sqrt{N_d}) $$\n        *   This is the functional dependence required by the first part of the problem: $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto \\sqrt{N_d}$.\n\n    *   **Part 3: Numerical Calculation**.\n        *   Now I need to plug in the given values.\n        *   $M = 3.06$ (dimensionless)\n        *   $\\alpha = 0.25$ (dimensionless)\n        *   $\\mu = 80~\\mathrm{GPa} = 80 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{Pa}$\n        *   $b = 0.248~\\mathrm{nm} = 0.248 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{m}$\n        *   $N_{d} = 5.0 \\times 10^{14}~\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n        *   Let's calculate $\\sqrt{N_d}$:\n            $$ \\sqrt{N_d} = \\sqrt{5.0 \\times 10^{14}~\\mathrm{m}^{-2}} = \\sqrt{5.0} \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\n            $$ \\sqrt{5.0} \\approx 2.2360679... $$\n            $$ \\sqrt{N_d} \\approx 2.2360679 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\n        *   Now, substitute everything into the formula for $\\Delta \\sigma$:\n            $$ \\Delta \\sigma = (3.06) \\times (0.25) \\times (80 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (0.248 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{m}) \\times (\\sqrt{5.0 \\times 10^{14}}~\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) $$\n        *   Let's group the numbers and the powers of 10.\n            $$ \\Delta \\sigma = (3.06 \\times 0.25 \\times 80 \\times 0.248 \\times \\sqrt{5.0}) \\times (10^9 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 10^7)~\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n        *   The powers of 10 simplify to $10^7$.\n            $$ \\Delta \\sigma = (3.06 \\times 0.25 \\times 80 \\times 0.248 \\times 2.2360679...) \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n        *   Let's do the multiplication:\n            *   $3.06 \\times 0.25 = 0.765$\n            *   $0.765 \\times 80 = 61.2$\n            *   $61.2 \\times 0.248 = 15.1776$\n            *   $15.1776 \\times 2.2360679... = 33.939...$\n        *   So, $\\Delta \\sigma \\approx 33.939 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n        *   Let's re-calculate with more precision to be sure.\n            *   $3.06 \\times 0.25 \\times 80 \\times 0.248 \\times \\sqrt{5} \\times 10^7$\n            *   $3.06 \\times 0.25 = 0.765$\n            *   $0.765 \\times 80 = 61.2$\n            *   $61.2 \\times 0.248 = 15.1776$\n            *   $15.1776 \\times 2.236067977 = 33.93902$\n            *   So the product is $33.93902$.\n            *   The result is $33.93902 \\times 10^7$ Pa.\n            *   $33.93902 \\times 10^7~\\mathrm{Pa} = 339.3902 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{Pa} = 339.3902~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\n    *   **Part 4: Final Answer Formatting**.\n        *   The problem asks for the numerical answer in MPa, rounded to three significant figures.\n        *   The calculated value is $339.3902...~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n        *   Rounding to three significant figures gives $339~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n        *   The final answer must be just the number `339` inside the boxed LaTeX environment.\n\n4.  **Final Review**:\n    *   **Solution Structure**: I will start by explaining the physics of dispersed barrier hardening.

We perform the unit conversion from meters to millimeters:\n$$1 \\, \\mathrm{m} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$a_c \\approx 0.017904 \\times 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$a_c \\approx 17.904 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives:\n$$a_c \\approx 17.9 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$$",
