This comparison will illuminate the fundamental differences in fuel consumption dynamics and operational requirements for these two nuclear energy sources.\n\nFirst, we establish the energy conversion factors.

Fusion Burn Fraction Calculation**\n\nThe fusion burn fraction, $f_{\\text{burn,fusion}}$, is defined as the fraction of fuel ions consumed in one particle confinement time, $\\tau_{p}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of fusion fuel ions, $N_{\\text{ions}}$, initially present in the plasma.

Fission Burn Fraction Calculation**\n\nThe fission burn fraction, $f_{\\text{burn,fission}}$, is defined as the fraction of fissile atoms in the core that undergo fission during one calendar year, $T_{\\text{yr}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of fissile atoms ($^{235}\\text{U}$ nuclei), $N_{^{235}\\text{U}}$, in the reactor core. We use the given mass $m_{\\text{fis}} = 1.000 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{kg}$, molar mass $M_{^{235}\\text{U}} = 235\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = 0.235\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$, and Avogadro's constant $N_{A} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n$$N_{^{235}\\text{U}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{fis}}}{M_{^{235}\\text{U}}} \\times N_{A}$$\n$$N_{^{235}\\text{U}} = \\frac{1.000 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{kg}}{0.235\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}} \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\approx 2.5626 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\text{atoms}$$\n\nNext, we determine the rate of fission reactions, $R_{\\text{fis}}$, required to produce the thermal power $P_{\\text{th}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{fis}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{th}}}{Q_{\\text{fis}}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{J/s}}{3.20435 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{J}} \\approx 3.1208 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nEach fission event consumes one $^{235}\\text{U}$ atom.\n\nThe number of fissile atoms consumed during one year, $N_{\\text{consumed,fission}}$, is this rate multiplied by $T_{\\text{yr}} = 3.1536 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{s}$.\n$$N_{\\text{consumed,fission}} = R_{\\text{fis}} \\times T_{\\text{yr}} = (3.1208 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (3.1536 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{s}) \\approx 9.8415 \\times 10^{26}\\,\\text{atoms}$$\n\nThe fission burn fraction is the ratio of atoms consumed to the total atoms present initially.\n$$f_{\\text{burn,fission}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{consumed,fission}}}{N_{^{235}\\text{U}}} = \\frac{9.8415 \\times 10^{26}}{2.5626 \\times 10^{28}} \\approx 0.038403$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the fission burn fraction is $0.0384$.\n\n**Interpretation of Consequences**\n\nThe calculated burn fractions, while numerically similar (both are a few percent), represent vastly different physical realities and engineering challenges.\n\nFor **fusion**, the burn fraction of approximately $2.7\\%$ occurs over the very short particle confinement time of $\\tau_p = 3.00\\,\\text{s}$. This signifies that only a small fraction of the fuel fuses per \"pass\" through the reactor. A fuel ion is far more likely to be lost from the plasma than to undergo fusion. This has a critical consequence for confinement: to achieve a self-sustaining reaction, the energy and particle confinement must be exquisitely good (maximizing $\\tau_p$) to increase the probability of fusion. It also dictates that a fusion power plant must operate like a continuous-flow chemical plant, where the vast majority of the fuel ($97\\%$) that is exhausted from the plasma chamber must be efficiently collected, separated from the helium \"ash,\" and reinjected into the plasma. The total fuel inventory in the machine at any one time is very small compared to the amount processed over time.\n\nFor **fission**, the burn fraction of approximately $3.8\\%$ occurs over one year. The fuel is a static, solid inventory that resides in the reactor core. This relatively low annual burnup is characteristic of Light Water Reactors and allows for long operational cycles (typically $12$ to $24$ months) before refueling is necessary. The \"fuel availability\" in the core decreases as fissile material is consumed and fission products (which act as neutron poisons) accumulate. Unlike fusion, there is no \"confinement time\" for fuel atoms; the challenge is not preventing fuel from escaping but managing the nuclear chain reaction over long periods and dealing with the resulting high-level radioactive waste. The fuel inventory is massive and is consumed in a batch process over years.\n\nIn summary, the fusion system is a low-inventory, high-throughput, low-efficiency-per-pass system reliant on excellent confinement and fuel recycling. The fission system is a massive-inventory, batch-process system with much higher fuel burnup over its long operating cycle.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It provides a simplified but standard model (the pairing term of the semi-empirical mass formula) to analyze nuclear reaction energetics. The assumptions are clearly stated to isolate the effect under investigation.

Odd-$A$ targets like ${}^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ are more easily fissioned by thermal neutrons than even-even targets like ${}^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ because neutron capture forms an even-even compound nucleus with a positive pairing contribution $\\delta \\approx +a_p A^{-1/2}$, thereby increasing $Q$ by roughly this amount and reducing the threshold relative to the fission barrier.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of the analysis for neutron capture on ${}^{235}\\mathrm{U}$. Capturing a neutron on an odd-$A$ target creates a highly stable even-even compound nucleus. The increased binding energy is released as excitation energy (a larger $Q$-value), which helps overcome the fission barrier. This is why ${}^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ is fissile with thermal neutrons. **Correct**.\n\n**B. For fusion of two even-even light nuclei, the pairing term increases the fusion $Q$-value because the final even-even nucleus has a positive pairing term, whereas the reactants’ pairing terms do not contribute additively.**\nThis is incorrect. As calculated for ${}^{12}\\mathrm{C} + {}^{12}\\mathrm{C}$, the pairing term *decreases* the $Q$-value. The reason is that the sum of the positive pairing energies of the two initial even-even nuclei, $2 \\times (+a_p A_1^{-1/2})$, is greater in magnitude than the positive pairing energy of the final, heavier even-even nucleus, $+a_p (2A_1)^{-1/2}$. Thus, the net change in binding energy due to pairing is negative. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The odd-even effect is negligible in neutron-induced reactions because neutrons carry no electric charge, so pairing is dominated by the Coulomb term and can be ignored in threshold estimates.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect on multiple levels. The pairing effect is a quantum mechanical consequence of the nuclear strong force and is fundamental to explaining the differences in fissility, not negligible. It has no connection to the neutron's lack of charge, nor is it \"dominated by the Coulomb term\"—they are distinct physical phenomena accounted for by separate terms in the SEMF. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. When comparing targets near $A \\approx 238$, an even-even target requires roughly $2 a_p A^{-1/2}$ more neutron kinetic energy to reach the same effective fission threshold as an odd-$A$ target, because neutron capture removes the positive pairing in the former case but adds it in the latter.**\nThe minimum required kinetic energy is $E_{n, \\text{min}} = B_f - Q$. The difference in required kinetic energy between an even-even target (e-e) and an odd-A target (o-A) is $\\Delta E_n = E_{n, \\text{e-e}} - E_{n, \\text{o-A}} = (B_f - Q_{\\text{e-e}}) - (B_f - Q_{\\text{o-A}}) = Q_{\\text{o-A}} - Q_{\\text{e-e}}$. Focusing on the pairing term's contribution, $Q_{p, \\text{o-A}} \\approx +a_p A^{-1/2}$ and $Q_{p, \\text{e-e}} \\approx -a_p A^{-1/2}$.\nThus, the difference is $\\Delta E_n \\approx (+a_p A^{-1/2}) - (-a_p A^{-1/2}) = 2 a_p A^{-1/2}$. The even-even target requires approximately $2 a_p A^{-1/2}$ more energy, which for $A \\approx 238$ is about $2 \\times 0.78\\,\\mathrm{MeV} = 1.56\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. The reasoning provided is also accurate. **Correct**.\n\n**E. For ${}^{12}\\mathrm{C} + {}^{12}\\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow {}^{24}\\mathrm{Mg}$, the pairing term alone reduces the fusion $Q$-value by approximately $4.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.**\nAs calculated in the fusion analysis, the contribution of the pairing term to the $Q$-value is $Q_p \\approx -4.48\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. A negative contribution to the $Q$-value is a reduction. Therefore, the statement is a correct quantitative conclusion from the provided model. **Correct**.\n\nFinal tally of correct statements: A, D, E.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It presents a standard calculation for the ignition condition in a deuterium-tritium fusion plasma, a cornerstone of fusion energy research known as the Lawson criterion. All necessary parameters and physical relations are provided.\n\nThe ignition condition is defined as the steady-state balance where the plasma self-heating from fusion reactions equals the power losses. The heating is provided by energetic alpha particles (${}^4\\text{He}$ nuclei), and the losses are modeled as the sum of transport-related losses (conduction and convection) and radiative losses from bremsstrahlung.\n\nThe power balance equation is:\n$$ P_{\\text{heating}} = P_{\\text{losses}} $$\n$$ P_{\\alpha} = P_{\\text{cond}} + P_{\\text{brem}} $$\n\nThe problem provides the following expressions for the power densities (power per unit volume):\n- Alpha-particle self-heating power density: $P_{\\alpha} = n_D n_T \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\alpha}$. Given a $50{:}50$ mixture where $n_D = n_T = n/2$ (with $n$ being the total ion density, assumed equal to the electron density $n_e$), this becomes $P_{\\alpha} = \\frac{n^2}{4} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\alpha}$.\n- Transport loss power density (conduction/convection): $P_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{U}{\\tau_E} = \\frac{3 n k_B T}{\\tau_E}$, where $U = 3 n k_B T$ is the plasma thermal energy density for $T_e = T_i = T$.\n- Bremsstrahlung radiation power density: $P_{\\text{brem}} = C_b Z_{\\text{eff}} n_e n_i \\sqrt{T_e}$. With $n_e = n_i = n$ and $T_e = T$, this is $P_{\\text{brem}} = C_b Z_{\\text{eff}} n^2 \\sqrt{T}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the power balance equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{n^2}{4} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\alpha} = \\frac{3 n k_B T}{\\tau_E} + C_b Z_{\\text{eff}} n^2 \\sqrt{T} $$\n\nOur objective is to derive an expression for the ignition parameter, the product $n \\tau_E$. To solve for this product, we first divide the entire equation by $n$:\n$$ \\frac{n}{4} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\alpha} = \\frac{3 k_B T}{\\tau_E} + C_b Z_{\\text{eff}} n \\sqrt{T} $$\n\nNext, we rearrange the equation to isolate the term containing $\\tau_E$:\n$$ \\frac{3 k_B T}{\\tau_E} = \\frac{n}{4} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\alpha} - C_b Z_{\\text{eff}} n \\sqrt{T} $$\n$$ \\frac{3 k_B T}{\\tau_E} = n \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\alpha} - C_b Z_{\\text{eff}} \\sqrt{T} \\right) $$\n\nFinally, by algebraic manipulation, we solve for the product $n \\tau_E$:\n$$ n \\tau_E = \\frac{3 k_B T}{\\frac{1}{4} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\alpha} - C_b Z_{\\text{eff}} \\sqrt{T}} $$\n\nThis is the general ignition condition for $n \\tau_E$ based on the provided model. We now compute its numerical value using the given parameters. It is crucial to maintain consistent units throughout the calculation. We will use SI units (Joules for energy, meters, seconds).\n\nThe parameters are:\n- $T = 15\\,\\text{keV} = 1.5 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{eV}$\n- $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = 1.2 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $E_{\\alpha} = 3.5\\,\\text{MeV} = 3.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{eV}$\n- $Z_{\\text{eff}} = 1.2$\n- $C_b = 1.69 \\times 10^{-38}\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{eV}^{-1/2}$\n- Conversion factor $e = 1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J/eV}$\n\nFirst, we convert the energy terms in the numerator and the first term of the denominator to Joules. The quantity $k_B T$ is the energy corresponding to temperature $T$, so $k_B T = 1.5 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{eV}$.\n- Numerator: $3 k_B T = 3 \\times (1.5 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{eV}) \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J/eV}) \\approx 7.2098 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{J}$.\n- Denominator Term $1$ (Alpha Heating): The energy $E_{\\alpha}$ is $3.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{eV}$.\n  $E_{\\alpha} = (3.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{eV}) \\times (1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J/eV}) \\approx 5.6076 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\text{J}$.\n  The heating term is $\\frac{1}{4} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{4} (1.2 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (5.6076 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\text{J}) \\approx 1.6823 \\times 10^{-35}\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^3$.\n\n- Denominator Term $2$ (Bremsstrahlung Loss): The formula for $P_{\\text{brem}}$ is given with a coefficient $C_b$ that requires the temperature $T$ to be in electron-volts (eV). We must adhere to this.\n  $T = 1.5 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{eV}$.\n  The loss term is $C_b Z_{\\text{eff}} \\sqrt{T} = (1.69 \\times 10^{-38}\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{eV}^{-1/2}) \\times (1.2) \\times \\sqrt{1.5 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{eV}} \\approx 2.4831 \\times 10^{-36}\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^3$.\n\nNow we combine these terms to calculate $n \\tau_E$:\n$$ n \\tau_E = \\frac{7.2098 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{J}}{1.6823 \\times 10^{-35}\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^3 - 2.4831 \\times 10^{-36}\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^3} $$\n$$ n \\tau_E = \\frac{7.2098 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{J}}{(1.6823 - 0.24831) \\times 10^{-35}\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^3} = \\frac{7.2098 \\times 10^{-15}}{1.4340 \\times 10^{-35}}\\,\\text{s}\\,\\text{m}^{-3} $$\n$$ n \\tau_E \\approx 5.0278 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\text{s}\\,\\text{m}^{-3} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the required product is $n \\tau_E \\approx 5.03 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n\nFor a reactor-scale density of $n = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$, the corresponding energy confinement time would be:\n$$ \\tau_E = \\frac{n \\tau_E}{n} = \\frac{5.03 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\cdot\\text{s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}} = 5.03\\,\\text{s} $$\nThis is a challenging but achievable goal for a large-scale fusion device.\n\nFinally, we compare the volumetric fusion power density with that of a typical fission reactor. The total fusion power density, $P_{\\text{fusion}}$, includes the energy of the neutron ($14.1\\,\\text{MeV}$) in addition to the alpha particle ($3.5\\,\\text{MeV}$), for a total of $E_{\\text{fusion}} = 17.6\\,\\text{MeV}$.\n$$ P_{\\text{fusion}} = n_D n_T \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\text{fusion}} = \\frac{n^2}{4} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle E_{\\text{fusion}} $$\nUsing $n = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$ and converting $E_{\\text{fusion}}$ to Joules ($17.6\\,\\text{MeV} \\approx 2.820 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{J}$):\n$$ P_{\\text{fusion}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})^2}{4} (1.2 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (2.820 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{J}) \\approx 0.85 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-3} $$\nThis power density of approximately $0.85\\,\\text{MW}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$ is substantially lower than that of a typical light-water fission reactor core, which is on the order of $100\\,\\text{MW}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$. The primary reason for this large difference lies in the energy deposition mechanisms. In a fission reactor, the massive fission fragments deposit their kinetic energy very locally within the solid fuel rods, leading to a highly compact and intense power source. In a D-T fusion reactor, only $20\\%$ of the energy (carried by the charged alpha particles) is deposited within the plasma volume for self-heating. The remaining $80\\%$ of the energy is carried by highly energetic, neutral neutrons that escape the plasma and deposit their energy over a much larger volume in the surrounding blanket and shielding structures. This inherently distributed nature of energy deposition results in a much lower power density for the fusion core itself compared to a fission core.",
