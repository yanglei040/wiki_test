It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from classical electromagnetism and plasma physics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the first adiabatic invariant $\\mu$ at the reference location $s=0$, and the maximum magnetic field magnitude $B_{\\max}$ at the mirroring point.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Adiabatic Invariant $\\mu$**\n\nThe motion of a particle with charge $q$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is governed by the Lorentz force, which, in the absence of an electric field, is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThis force is always perpendicular to the velocity, so it does no work on the particle. Consequently, the kinetic energy of the particle, $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, is conserved, as stated in assumption (iii).\n\nThe velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ can be decomposed into components parallel ($v_\\|$) and perpendicular ($v_\\perp$) to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. At the reference location $s=0$, the magnetic field magnitude is $B_0$ and the pitch angle is $\\alpha$. The components of the velocity $v_0 = |\\mathbf{v}|$ are:\n$$\nv_{\\perp, 0} = v_0 \\sin(\\alpha)\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\|, 0} = v_0 \\cos(\\alpha)\n$$\nThe perpendicular component of the velocity, $v_{\\perp, 0}$, leads to a circular motion (gyromotion) around the magnetic field line. The magnetic force provides the necessary centripetal force for this circular motion. The magnitude of this force is $F_\\perp = |q| v_{\\perp, 0} B_0$. The centripetal force required for a circular path of radius $r_g$ (the gyroradius) is $F_c = m v_{\\perp, 0}^2 / r_g$. Equating these forces gives:\n$$\n|q| v_{\\perp, 0} B_0 = \\frac{m v_{\\perp, 0}^2}{r_g}\n$$\nThe problem requires us to use the magnetic moment of a current loop as the basis for the derivation. The gyrating particle constitutes a microscopic current loop. The current $I$ is the total charge that passes a point on the orbit per unit time. This is the particle's charge magnitude $|q|$ divided by the time for one gyration, the gyroperiod $T_g$:\n$$\nI = \\frac{|q|}{T_g}\n$$\nThe gyroperiod is the circumference of the gyration circle divided by the perpendicular speed: $T_g = \\frac{2\\pi r_g}{v_{\\perp, 0}}$. Thus, the current is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{|q| v_{\\perp, 0}}{2\\pi r_g}\n$$\nThe magnetic moment $\\mu$ of a current loop is defined as the product of the current and the area $A$ of the loop. The area of the gyration orbit is $A = \\pi r_g^2$.\n$$\n\\mu = I A = \\left(\\frac{|q| v_{\\perp, 0}}{2\\pi r_g}\\right) (\\pi r_g^2) = \\frac{1}{2} |q| v_{\\perp, 0} r_g\n$$\nWe can eliminate the gyroradius $r_g$ from this expression using the force balance equation derived earlier: $r_g = \\frac{m v_{\\perp, 0}}{|q| B_0}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} |q| v_{\\perp, 0} \\left(\\frac{m v_{\\perp, 0}}{|q| B_0}\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\perp, 0}^2}{B_0}\n$$\nThis quantity, the ratio of the perpendicular kinetic energy to the magnetic field strength, is the first adiabatic invariant. We now express it in terms of the given total kinetic energy $E$ and the pitch angle $\\alpha$. The total kinetic energy at $s=0$ is $E = \\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2$. The perpendicular kinetic energy at $s=0$ is $E_{\\perp, 0} = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\perp, 0}^2$. Using $v_{\\perp, 0} = v_0 \\sin(\\alpha)$, we get:\n$$\nE_{\\perp, 0} = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_0 \\sin(\\alpha))^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2\\right) \\sin^2(\\alpha) = E \\sin^2(\\alpha)\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\mu$ at $s=0$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{E_{\\perp, 0}}{B_0} = \\frac{E \\sin^2(\\alpha)}{B_0}\n$$\nThis is the first required result.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Mirroring Field $B_{\\max}$**\n\nThe problem states that the field varies slowly, so the adiabatic invariant $\\mu$ is conserved along the particle's trajectory. The kinetic energy $E$ is also conserved.\nAt any point along the field line, the following two conservation laws hold:\n1. Conservation of Kinetic Energy: $E = E_\\perp + E_\\| = \\frac{1}{2} m v_\\perp^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v_\\|^2 = \\text{constant}$\n2. Conservation of the First Adiabatic Invariant: $\\mu = \\frac{E_\\perp}{B} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m v_\\perp^2}{B} = \\text{constant}$\n\nFrom the conservation of $\\mu$, we can express the perpendicular kinetic energy at any point with magnetic field $B$ as $E_\\perp = \\mu B$. Substituting this into the energy conservation equation:\n$$\nE = \\mu B + E_\\|\n$$\nThis gives the parallel kinetic energy as a function of the local magnetic field strength:\n$$\nE_\\|(B) = E - \\mu B\n$$\nMagnetic mirroring occurs when the particle's motion along the field line reverses. This happens at the point where the parallel velocity becomes zero, $v_\\| = 0$, which means the parallel kinetic energy $E_\\|$ also becomes zero. Let $B_{\\max}$ be the magnetic field magnitude at this reflection point. Setting $E_\\| = 0$:\n$$\n0 = E - \\mu B_{\\max}\n$$\nSolving for $B_{\\max}$ gives:\n$$\nB_{\\max} = \\frac{E}{\\mu}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\mu$ that we derived in Part 1, which was evaluated at the reference position $s=0$: $\\mu = \\frac{E \\sin^2(\\alpha)}{B_0}$.\n$$\nB_{\\max} = \\frac{E}{\\left(\\frac{E \\sin^2(\\alpha)}{B_0}\\right)} = \\frac{E B_0}{E \\sin^2(\\alpha)}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\max} = \\frac{B_0}{\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\n$$\nThis is the second required result. The particle is confined if the maximum field in the mirror device is greater than this value. If $\\alpha = \\pi/2$, then $v_\\| = 0$ initially, and $B_{\\max} = B_0$; the particle is instantly reflected or trapped at $s=0$. If $\\alpha = 0$, then $\\sin(\\alpha)=0$ and $B_{\\max} \\to \\infty$, meaning the particle is not reflected by any finite magnetic field and escapes (this is the \"loss cone\").\n\nThe final results are $\\mu = \\frac{E \\sin^2(\\alpha)}{B_0}$ and $B_{\\max} = \\frac{B_0}{\\sin^2(\\alpha)}$.",

The language is objective and scientifically precise. The problem satisfies all criteria for validity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe motion of the charged particle is governed by two conserved quantities as stated in the problem.\n\n$1$. The total kinetic energy $E$ is constant:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\perp}^2$$\nwhere $v_{\\parallel}$ is the component of the velocity parallel to the magnetic field line and $v_{\\perp}$ is the component perpendicular to it.\n\n$2$. The first adiabatic invariant, the magnetic moment $\\mu$, is constant:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2 B(s)}$$\nwhere $B(s)$ is the local magnetic field strength.\n\nOur goal is to find the turning points $s_m$, which are defined as the locations where the particle's parallel motion momentarily stops, i.e., $v_{\\parallel} = 0$.\n\nFrom the conservation of the magnetic moment $\\mu$, we can express the perpendicular kinetic energy, $\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\perp}^2$, as a function of the local magnetic field strength $B(s)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\perp}^2 = \\mu B(s)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for the perpendicular kinetic energy into the equation for the total energy $E$:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\mu B(s)$$\n\nThis equation describes how the particle's energy is partitioned between parallel motion and perpendicular motion at any point $s$ along the field line. We can rearrange it to solve for the parallel kinetic energy:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\parallel}^2 = E - \\mu B(s)$$\n\nThe turning points, which we denote by $s_m$, are the positions where the particle reverses its direction of parallel motion. At these points, the parallel velocity is zero, $v_{\\parallel}(s_m) = 0$. Consequently, the parallel kinetic energy must also be zero at the turning points. Setting $\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\parallel}^2 = 0$ in the equation above, we obtain the general condition for magnetic mirroring:\n$$E - \\mu B(s_m) = 0$$\nThis implies that at the turning points, all the particle's kinetic energy is in the form of perpendicular motion.

The solution involves analyzing the system in two scenarios: the ideal (unperturbed) case where the adiabatic invariant $\\mu$ is an exact constant of motion, and the perturbed case where its value drifts systematically.\n\nThe fundamental principles for a charged particle in a static magnetic field are the conservation of total kinetic energy $E$ and the (approximate) conservation of the first adiabatic invariant $\\mu$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_{\\perp}^2 + v_{\\parallel}^2)$$\nwhere $v_{\\perp}$ and $v_{\\parallel}$ are the velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, respectively. Since there are no electric fields or other forces doing work, $E$ is a constant of motion.\n\nThe first adiabatic invariant is defined as:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2 B}$$\nwhere $B = |\\mathbf{B}|$.\n\nAt the mirror point, by definition, the parallel velocity vanishes, $v_{\\parallel} = 0$. At this specific location, the entire kinetic energy is in the perpendicular motion:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\perp,m}^2$$\nwhere the subscript '$m$' denotes quantities at the mirror point.\nThe value of the adiabatic invariant at the mirror point is:\n$$\\mu_m = \\frac{m v_{\\perp,m}^2}{2 B_m} = \\frac{2E}{2 B_m} = \\frac{E}{B_m}$$\nThis equation provides a general relationship between the conserved energy $E$, the mirror field $B_m$, and the value of the invariant at the mirror point $\\mu_m$:\n$$B_m = \\frac{E}{\\mu_m}$$\n\nLet's first analyze the unperturbed case to find $B_m^{(0)}$.\nIn the ideal case, the adiabatic invariant $\\mu$ is exactly conserved, so its value is the same everywhere along the particle's trajectory. Thus, the value at the mirror point, $\\mu_m^{(0)}$, is equal to its value at the reference location, $\\mu_0$.\n$$\\mu_m^{(0)} = \\mu_0$$\nAt the reference location, we are given the field $B_0$ and the particle's velocity components $v_{\\perp 0} = v_0 \\sin \\alpha_0$. So, the invariant is:\n$$\\mu_0 = \\frac{m v_{\\perp 0}^2}{2 B_0} = \\frac{m (v_0 \\sin \\alpha_0)^2}{2 B_0}$$\nThe total energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2}m v_0^2$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mu_0$:\n$$\\mu_0 = \\frac{(2E/v_0^2) (v_0 \\sin \\alpha_0)^2}{2 B_0} = \\frac{E \\sin^2 \\alpha_0}{B_0}$$\nThe unperturbed mirror field $B_m^{(0)}$ is found by setting $\\mu_m = \\mu_m^{(0)} = \\mu_0$ in the general relation for the mirror field:\n$$B_m^{(0)} = \\frac{E}{\\mu_m^{(0)}} = \\frac{E}{\\mu_0} = \\frac{E}{(E \\sin^2 \\alpha_0)/B_0} = \\frac{B_0}{\\sin^2 \\alpha_0}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the perturbed case.\nThe problem states that there is a small systematic breakdown of adiabatic invariance such that the effective $\\mu$ that enters the mirror condition is $\\mu_m = \\mu_0(1+\\delta)$. This means the value of the invariant at the new mirror point, where the field is $B_m$, is related to its initial value $\\mu_0$ by this modification.\nThe energy $E$ is still conserved and the initial conditions at the reference point (and thus $\\mu_0$) are unchanged.\nThe new mirror field $B_m$ is determined by the same general relation, but with the modified invariant $\\mu_m$:\n$$B_m = \\frac{E}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{E}{\\mu_0(1+\\delta)}$$\nWe can relate this to the unperturbed mirror field $B_m^{(0)} = E/\\mu_0$:\n$$B_m = \\frac{1}{1+\\delta} \\left(\\frac{E}{\\mu_0}\\right) = \\frac{B_m^{(0)}}{1+\\delta}$$\n\nFinally, we determine the fractional shift in the mirror field, $\\frac{\\delta B_m}{B_m^{(0)}}$, to first order in $\\delta$.\nThe change in the mirror field is $\\delta B_m = B_m - B_m^{(0)}$.\n$$\\delta B_m = \\frac{B_m^{(0)}}{1+\\delta} - B_m^{(0)} = B_m^{(0)} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\delta} - 1\\right) = B_m^{(0)} \\left(\\frac{1 - (1+\\delta)}{1+\\delta}\\right) = B_m^{(0)} \\left(\\frac{-\\delta}{1+\\delta}\\right)$$\nThe fractional shift is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\delta B_m}{B_m^{(0)}} = \\frac{B_m^{(0)} \\left(\\frac{-\\delta}{1+\\delta}\\right)}{B_m^{(0)}} = \\frac{-\\delta}{1+\\delta}$$\nThe problem asks for this quantity to first order in $\\delta$. Since $|\\delta| \\ll 1$, we can use the Taylor expansion for $\\frac{1}{1+\\delta}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{1+\\delta} = 1 - \\delta + \\delta^2 - \\dots \\approx 1 - \\delta$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the fractional shift:\n$$\\frac{\\delta B_m}{B_m^{(0)}} = -\\delta \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\delta}\\right) \\approx -\\delta(1-\\delta) = -\\delta + \\delta^2$$\nTo first order in $\\delta$, we keep only the term linear in $\\delta$. The fractional shift is:\n$$\\frac{\\delta B_m}{B_m^{(0)}} \\approx -\\delta$$\nThis expression is in terms of $\\delta$ only, as required. A positive $\\delta$ (an increase in $\\mu$) corresponds to a lower mirror field, which is physically consistent, as a larger magnetic moment requires a smaller field to contain the particle's energy in perpendicular motion.",
