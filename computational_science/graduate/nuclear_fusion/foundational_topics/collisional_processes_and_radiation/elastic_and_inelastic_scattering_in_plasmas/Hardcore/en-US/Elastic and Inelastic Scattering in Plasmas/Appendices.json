The concepts of plasma quasi-neutrality, effective charge, collisional resistivity, and magnetic diffusion are standard principles in plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). All given values are physically plausible for a fusion-grade plasma. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we compute the electron density $n_e$ and the effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Second, we establish the physical relationship between $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and the current diffusion time $\\tau_J$. Third, we calculate the required ratio of diffusion times.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Electron Density and Effective Charge**\n\nThe plasma is assumed to be quasi-neutral, which implies that the total negative charge density from electrons must balance the total positive charge density from all ion species. The electron charge is $-e$, and the charge of an ion species $s$ is $Z_s e$, where $Z_s$ is the charge number. The condition is:\n$$\nn_e e = \\sum_s n_s Z_s e\n$$\nThis simplifies to the expression for electron number density:\n$$\nn_e = \\sum_s n_s Z_s\n$$\nThe problem provides the number densities $n_s$ and charge numbers $Z_s$ for five ion species: deuterium ($\\mathrm{D}^{+}$), helium ($\\mathrm{He}^{2+}$), two charge states of carbon ($\\mathrm{C}^{6+}$, $\\mathrm{C}^{5+}$), and tungsten ($\\mathrm{W}^{40+}$). The respective charge numbers are $Z_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}}=1$, $Z_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}}=2$, $Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}}=6$, $Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}}=5$, and $Z_{\\mathrm{W}^{40+}}=40$.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nn_e = n_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}}Z_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}} + n_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}}Z_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}} + n_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}}Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}} + n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}}Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} + n_{\\mathrm{W}^{40+}}Z_{\\mathrm{W}^{40+}}\n$$\n$$\nn_e = (2.5 \\times 10^{19} \\times 1) + (1.0 \\times 10^{18} \\times 2) + (5.0 \\times 10^{17} \\times 6) + (5.0 \\times 10^{17} \\times 5) + (1.0 \\times 10^{16} \\times 40)\n$$\nExpressing all terms in units of $10^{19} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$:\n$$\nn_e = [2.5 + (0.1 \\times 2) + (0.05 \\times 6) + (0.05 \\times 5) + (0.001 \\times 40)] \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\nn_e = [2.5 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.25 + 0.04] \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\nn_e = 3.29 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nNext, we compute the effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, defined as:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_{s} n_{s} Z_{s}^{2}}{n_{e}}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $\\sum_{s} n_{s} Z_{s}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{s} n_{s} Z_{s}^{2} = n_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}}Z_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}}Z_{\\mathrm{He}^{2+}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}}Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{6+}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}}Z_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{W}^{40+}}Z_{\\mathrm{W}^{40+}}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{s} n_{s} Z_{s}^{2} = (2.5 \\times 10^{19} \\times 1^2) + (1.0 \\times 10^{18} \\times 2^2) + (5.0 \\times 10^{17} \\times 6^2) + (5.0 \\times 10^{17} \\times 5^2) + (1.0 \\times 10^{16} \\times 40^2)\n$$\nAgain, expressing all terms in units of $10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{s} n_{s} Z_{s}^{2} = [2.5 \\times 1 + 0.1 \\times 4 + 0.05 \\times 36 + 0.05 \\times 25 + 0.001 \\times 1600] \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{s} n_{s} Z_{s}^{2} = [2.5 + 0.4 + 1.8 + 1.25 + 1.6] \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{s} n_{s} Z_{s}^{2} = 7.55 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nNow, we can compute $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{7.55 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}}{3.29 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}} = \\frac{7.55}{3.29} \\approx 2.2948...\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Physical Dependence of Current Diffusion Time on $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**\n\nThe physics chain linking $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ to the current diffusion time $\\tau_J$ is established through the electron-ion collision frequency and electrical resistivity.\n\n1.  **Electron-ion collision frequency ($\\nu_{ei}$)**: In a plasma, electrical resistivity arises primarily from the momentum lost by current-carrying electrons in collisions with ions. The problem states that the momentum-transfer rate is dominated by elastic small-angle Coulomb interactions. The collision frequency for an electron with ions of species $s$ is proportional to the ion density $n_s$ and the square of the ion charge $Z_s^2$. The total momentum-transfer collision frequency for an electron moving through a field of multiple ion species is the sum of the frequencies for each species:\n    $$\n    \\nu_{ei} \\propto \\sum_s n_s Z_s^2\n    $$\n    This is a statement from kinetic theory.\n\n2.  **Electrical resistivity ($\\eta$)**: In a simple fluid model (Drude model), resistivity is given by $\\eta = m_e \\nu_{ei} / (n_e e^2)$. A more rigorous kinetic treatment, like the Spitzer-Härm calculation, shows that the resistivity of a multi-species plasma, for a given electron temperature $T_e$ and Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda$, scales as:\n    $$\n    \\eta \\propto \\frac{\\sum_s n_s Z_s^2}{n_e T_e^{3/2}}\n    $$\n    Using the definition of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, this becomes:\n    $$\n    \\eta \\propto \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{T_e^{3/2}}\n    $$\n    Thus, for a constant electron temperature, the resistivity is directly proportional to the effective charge: $\\eta \\propto Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Higher impurity content, which increases $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, leads to higher resistivity.\n\n3.  **Current diffusion time ($\\tau_J$)**: The evolution of the magnetic field in a resistive plasma is described by the magnetic induction equation. For a stationary plasma, this reduces to a diffusion equation for the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\nabla^2 \\vec{B}\n    $$\n    where $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. This equation describes the diffusion of the magnetic field (and the associated currents) with a magnetic diffusivity $D_m = \\eta/\\mu_0$. The characteristic timescale $\\tau_J$ for this diffusion process over a length scale $a$ is:\n    $$\n    \\tau_J \\sim \\frac{a^2}{D_m} = \\frac{\\mu_0 a^2}{\\eta}\n    $$\n    This confirms the problem's statement that the diffusion timescale scales inversely with resistivity: $\\tau_J \\propto 1/\\eta$.\n\nCombining these proportionalities, we find the dependence of $\\tau_J$ on $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Since $\\tau_J \\propto 1/\\eta$ and $\\eta \\propto Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (for fixed $T_e$), it follows that:\n$$\n\\tau_J \\propto \\frac{1}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nThis means that a plasma with a higher effective charge (more impurities) will have a shorter current diffusion time, as the higher resistivity allows the magnetic field to diffuse more rapidly.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Diffusion Time Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\tau_{J}(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})/\\tau_{J}(1)$. The term $\\tau_{J}(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})$ is the diffusion time in the given impurity-laden plasma. The term $\\tau_{J}(1)$ is the diffusion time in a pure deuterium plasma.\n\nFor the pure deuterium plasma, the only ion species is $\\mathrm{D}^{+}$ with $Z=1$. By quasi-neutrality, $n_e = n_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}}$. The effective charge, which we denote as $Z_{\\mathrm{eff, D}}$, is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff, D}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}} \\times 1^2}{n_e} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}}}{n_{\\mathrm{D}^{+}}} = 1\n$$\nThis confirms that the reference case corresponds to $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that $T_e$, $\\ln\\Lambda$, and $a$ are the same for both the impure and pure plasmas. From our analysis, $\\tau_J$ is proportional to $1/Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Therefore, we can write the ratio as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{J}(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{\\tau_{J}(1)} = \\frac{1 / Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{1 / Z_{\\mathrm{eff, D}}} = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{eff, D}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nUsing our calculated value for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{J}(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{\\tau_{J}(1)} = \\frac{1}{7.55 / 3.29} = \\frac{3.29}{7.55} \\approx 0.435761589...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.4358$.",

It is a standard, well-posed problem in plasma physics. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Bremsstrahlung Power Density\nThe total power density radiated from a plasma due to electron–ion bremsstrahlung, $P_{\\mathrm{brem}}$, is the sum of the power radiated from electron collisions with each ion species present in the plasma. For a single ion species $j$ with charge number $Z_j$ and number density $n_j$, the bremsstrahlung power density in the nonrelativistic limit is given by the expression:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{brem}, j} = C_{B} n_{e} n_{j} Z_{j}^{2} \\sqrt{T_{e}} \\bar{g}_{ff,j}$$\nwhere $C_{B}$ is a constant incorporating fundamental physical constants ($C_B \\approx 1.69 \\times 10^{-38} \\, \\mathrm{W} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^3 \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1/2}$ if $T_e$ is in Kelvin, or a different value for $T_e$ in eV), and $\\bar{g}_{ff,j}$ is the frequency-averaged Gaunt factor for that species. The problem states we can approximate the Gaunt factor as unity for all species.\n\nThe total bremsstrahlung power density is the sum over all ion species $j$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{brem}} = \\sum_{j} P_{\\mathrm{brem}, j} = \\sum_{j} C_{B} n_{e} n_{j} Z_{j}^{2} \\sqrt{T_{e}}$$\nWe can factor out the terms that do not depend on the ion species $j$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{brem}} = C_{B} n_{e} \\sqrt{T_{e}} \\left( \\sum_{j} n_{j} Z_{j}^{2} \\right)$$\nThe problem provides the definition of the effective ion charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\sum_{j} n_{j} Z_{j}^{2} / n_{e}$. We can rearrange this definition to solve for the summation term:\n$$\\sum_{j} n_{j} Z_{j}^{2} = n_{e} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{brem}}$ yields:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{brem}} = C_{B} n_{e} \\sqrt{T_{e}} (n_{e} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = C_{B} n_{e}^{2} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{T_{e}}$$\nThis expression explicitly shows that, for fixed $n_{e}$ and $T_{e}$, the bremsstrahlung power density is directly proportional to the effective ion charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\n### Modification of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ by Impurities\nNext, we derive an expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in terms of the impurity concentration $f$. The plasma consists of two ion species: the main hydrogenic fuel (denoted by subscript $H$) and the high-$Z$ impurity (denoted by subscript $I$).\n- Fuel ions: charge number $Z_{H}=1$, number density $n_{H}$.\n- Impurity ions: charge number $Z_{I}$, number density $n_{I}$.\n\nThe summation in the definition of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ becomes:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{n_{H} Z_{H}^{2} + n_{I} Z_{I}^{2}}{n_{e}} = \\frac{n_{H} (1)^{2} + n_{I} Z_{I}^{2}}{n_{e}} = \\frac{n_{H} + n_{I} Z_{I}^{2}}{n_{e}}$$\nThe problem states that quasi-neutrality holds ($n_{e} = \\sum_{j} n_{j} Z_{j}$) and that the electron density $n_{e}$ is held fixed. For our two-species plasma, the quasi-neutrality condition is:\n$$n_{e} = n_{H} Z_{H} + n_{I} Z_{I} = n_{H} (1) + n_{I} Z_{I} = n_{H} + n_{I} Z_{I}$$\nThis is a critical constraint. As impurities are added (increasing $n_{I}$), the density of the main fuel ions $n_{H}$ must decrease to maintain a fixed $n_{e}$. We solve for $n_{H}$:\n$$n_{H} = n_{e} - n_{I} Z_{I}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $n_{H}$ into our equation for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{(n_{e} - n_{I} Z_{I}) + n_{I} Z_{I}^{2}}{n_{e}}$$\nWe can divide each term by $n_e$:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{n_{e}}{n_{e}} - \\frac{n_{I} Z_{I}}{n_{e}} + \\frac{n_{I} Z_{I}^{2}}{n_{e}} = 1 - \\frac{n_{I}}{n_{e}} Z_{I} + \\frac{n_{I}}{n_{e}} Z_{I}^{2}$$\nUsing the definition of the impurity concentration, $f \\equiv n_{I}/n_{e}$, we obtain the expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ as a function of $f$:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(f) = 1 - f Z_{I} + f Z_{I}^{2} = 1 + f(Z_{I}^{2} - Z_{I})$$\nA pure $Z=1$ plasma corresponds to $f=0$, which gives $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(0) = 1$. Since the problem states $Z_{I} \\geq 2$, the term $(Z_{I}^{2} - Z_{I}) = Z_{I}(Z_{I}-1)$ is always positive. Therefore, any impurity presence ($f > 0$) increases $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ above $1$. Since $P_{\\mathrm{brem}} \\propto Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, this in turn increases the bremsstrahlung power loss.\n\n### Calculation of the Critical Impurity Concentration $f_{c}$\nWe are asked to find the critical impurity concentration $f_{c}$ that results in the bremsstrahlung power density being exactly double the value for a pure $Z=1$ plasma, holding $n_e$ and $T_e$ fixed.\nLet $P_{0}$ be the power density for the pure plasma ($f=0$). In this case, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}=1$:\n$$P_{0} = C_{B} n_{e}^{2} (1) \\sqrt{T_{e}} = C_{B} n_{e}^{2} \\sqrt{T_{e}}$$\nLet $P_{f_c}$ be the power density at the critical concentration $f_c$. The corresponding effective charge is $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(f_c)$.\n$$P_{f_c} = C_{B} n_{e}^{2} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(f_c) \\sqrt{T_{e}}$$\nThe condition given is $P_{f_c} = 2 P_{0}$:\n$$C_{B} n_{e}^{2} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(f_c) \\sqrt{T_{e}} = 2 \\left( C_{B} n_{e}^{2} \\sqrt{T_{e}} \\right)$$\nDividing both sides by $C_{B} n_{e}^{2} \\sqrt{T_{e}}$ simplifies the condition to:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(f_c) = 2$$\nWe now use our derived expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(f)$:\n$$1 + f_{c}(Z_{I}^{2} - Z_{I}) = 2$$\nSolving for $f_{c}$:\n$$f_{c}(Z_{I}^{2} - Z_{I}) = 2 - 1 = 1$$\n$$f_{c} = \\frac{1}{Z_{I}^{2} - Z_{I}}$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$f_{c} = \\frac{1}{Z_{I}(Z_{I} - 1)}$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the critical impurity concentration in terms of the impurity charge number $Z_I$ only.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, based on fundamental principles of collision theory in plasma physics. All necessary parameters and simplifying assumptions are explicitly provided. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we will derive the mean free path for charge exchange (CX), denoted as $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}$. The problem asks us to start from the definition of the binary-collision frequency, $\\nu$. For a single test particle (in this case, a deuterium ion) moving at a speed $v$ through a field of target particles (neutral deuterium atoms), the collision frequency is the product of the target number density $n_n$, the collision cross section $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cx}}$, and the relative speed between the colliding particles. The problem specifies a \"cold neutral deuterium\" background, which implies the thermal velocity of the neutral atoms is negligible compared to the ion velocity. Therefore, the relative speed is simply the ion speed, $v$. The collision frequency for a single ion is thus:\n$$ \\nu_{\\mathrm{cx}} = n_n \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cx}} v $$\nThe mean free path, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}$, is defined as the average distance an ion travels between successive CX collisions. This distance is related to the ion's speed and the collision frequency by:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}} = \\frac{v}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{cx}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu_{\\mathrm{cx}}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}} = \\frac{v}{n_n \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cx}} v} = \\frac{1}{n_n \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cx}}} $$\nThis expression for the mean free path is independent of the ion's energy or speed, given the assumption that the cross section $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cx}}$ is constant over the relevant energy range.\n\nNext, we derive the survival probability for an ion traversing a distance $L$ without undergoing a CX event. The problem states that we should assume uncorrelated collision statistics. This implies that the probability of a collision in any infinitesimal path segment $dx$ is independent of the ion's history. The probability of a collision occurring in the segment $dx$ is given by the ratio of the length of the segment to the mean free path, $dP_{\\mathrm{coll}} = \\frac{dx}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}}$.\n\nLet $P(x)$ be the probability that an ion has survived (not undergone a collision) after traveling a distance $x$. The probability of an ion surviving up to a distance $x+dx$ is the product of the probability of surviving to $x$ and the probability of *not* having a collision in the segment $dx$:\n$$ P(x+dx) = P(x) \\left(1 - dP_{\\mathrm{coll}}\\right) = P(x) \\left(1 - \\frac{dx}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}}\\right) $$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$ P(x+dx) - P(x) = - \\frac{P(x)}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}} dx $$\nDividing by $dx$ and taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we obtain the differential equation for the survival probability:\n$$ \\frac{dP(x)}{dx} = - \\frac{P(x)}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}} $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables, with the initial condition that the ion's survival probability at the start of its path is unity, i.e., $P(0) = 1$.\n$$ \\int_{P(0)}^{P(L)} \\frac{dP}{P} = - \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{dx}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}} $$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$ \\ln(P(L)) - \\ln(P(0)) = - \\frac{L}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}} $$\nSince $\\ln(P(0)) = \\ln(1) = 0$, we have:\n$$ \\ln(P(L)) = - \\frac{L}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}} $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the survival probability, $P_{\\mathrm{surv}}(L)$, after traversing the chord of length $L$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{surv}}(L) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}}\\right) $$\nThis result is a specific application of the Beer-Lambert law.\n\nThe problem asks for two numerical quantities. First, the CX mean free path, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}$. Using the derived formula and the provided data:\n$$ n_n = 7.5 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cx}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}} = \\frac{1}{n_n \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cx}}} = \\frac{1}{(7.5 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2)} = \\frac{1}{1.5}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}} \\approx 0.66666...\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}} = 0.6667\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nSecond, we must evaluate the energy-loss fraction. The problem states that \"a single CX event removes the entire ion kinetic energy from the confined ion population\". The energy-loss fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{loss}}$, is the fraction of the initial total kinetic energy of the ion population that is lost during the single pass.\nThe probability that a given ion undergoes at least one CX collision is the complement of the survival probability:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 1 - P_{\\mathrm{surv}}(L) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}}\\right) $$\nSince each collision removes all the kinetic energy of the ion involved, the fraction of the total energy removed from the population is equal to the fraction of ions that undergo a collision. Thus, the energy-loss fraction is equal to the loss probability:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{loss}} = P_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}}\\right) $$\nUsing the provided chord length $L = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and our calculated mean free path $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ \\frac{L}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cx}}} = \\frac{0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}}{2/3\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 0.40 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 0.60 $$\nThe argument of the exponential is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.60) $$\nCalculating the value:\n$$ \\exp(-0.60) \\approx 0.5488116... $$\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{loss}} \\approx 1 - 0.5488116... = 0.4511883... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $f_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 0.4512$.\n\nThe two requested numerical quantities are the mean free path and the energy-loss fraction.\nMean free path: $0.6667\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nEnergy-loss fraction: $0.4512$.",
