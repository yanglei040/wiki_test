Evaluate this fraction for $T_{e}=50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\nReport the final numerical value of $F$ as a unitless decimal fraction, rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The core of the problem is a standard calculation in plasma physics concerning the spectrum of thermal bremsstrahlung radiation.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction $F$ of the total bremsstrahlung power that is emitted into photons with energy $\\hbar\\omega \\geq m_{e}c^{2}$. We start from the standard expression for the thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity (power per unit volume per unit angular frequency), $j_{\\omega}$, for a Maxwellian electron distribution in the non-relativistic limit. Under the assumption that the free-free Gaunt factor, $\\bar{g}_{\\mathrm{ff}}$, is constant with respect to frequency $\\omega$, the emissivity has the form:\n$$ j_{\\omega} = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) $$\nHere, $T_{e}$ is the electron temperature, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The term $K$ is a constant that depends on the electron density $n_{e}$, ion density $n_{i}$, average ion charge number $Z$, electron temperature $T_{e}$, and various fundamental physical constants. Since the problem requires calculating a fraction of the total power, this constant $K$ will cancel out and its explicit form is not needed, as correctly noted in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total power radiated per unit volume, $P_{total}$, by integrating $j_{\\omega}$ over all possible photon angular frequencies from $\\omega=0$ to $\\omega=\\infty$.\n$$ P_{total} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} j_{\\omega} \\, d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) \\, d\\omega $$\nTo solve this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}$. Then $d\\omega = \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar}du$. The limits of integration for $u$ are from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$ P_{total} = K \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\left(\\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar}\\right) \\, du = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, du $$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, du = [-\\exp(-u)]_{0}^{\\infty} = -0 - (-1) = 1$.\nThus, the total radiated power is:\n$$ P_{total} = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the power radiated into photons with energy $\\hbar\\omega \\geq m_{e}c^{2}$, which we denote as $P_{high\\_energy}$. This corresponds to an angular frequency range from a minimum value $\\omega_{min} = \\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{\\hbar}$ to $\\infty$.\n$$ P_{high\\_energy} = \\int_{\\omega_{min}}^{\\infty} j_{\\omega} \\, d\\omega = \\int_{m_{e}c^{2}/\\hbar}^{\\infty} K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) \\, d\\omega $$\nUsing the same substitution $u = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T_{e}}$, the lower limit of integration for $u$ becomes:\n$$ u_{min} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{min}}{k_{B}T_{e}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\left(\\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{\\hbar}\\right) = \\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}} $$\nThe integral for the high-energy power is:\n$$ P_{high\\_energy} = K \\int_{u_{min}}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\left(\\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar}\\right) \\, du = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\int_{u_{min}}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, du $$\nThe integral evaluates to $[-\\exp(-u)]_{u_{min}}^{\\infty} = -0 - (-\\exp(-u_{min})) = \\exp(-u_{min})$.\nTherefore, the high-energy power is:\n$$ P_{high\\_energy} = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\exp(-u_{min}) = K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) $$\n\nThe desired fraction $F$ is the ratio of the high-energy power to the total power:\n$$ F = \\frac{P_{high\\_energy}}{P_{total}} = \\frac{K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right)}{K \\frac{k_{B}T_{e}}{\\hbar}} $$\nThe pre-factors cancel, yielding the analytical expression for the fraction:\n$$ F = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this fraction for the given plasma parameters.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Characteristic Frequency Dependence\n\nThe motion of the electron is governed by the Lorentz force law for a particle with charge $q=-e$ and relativistic momentum $\\mathbf{p}=\\gamma m \\mathbf{v}$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{p}}{dt} = -e (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) $$\nSince the Lorentz force does no work ($\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = -e(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$), the kinetic energy of the electron, and thus its Lorentz factor $\\gamma$, remain constant (neglecting the energy loss due to radiation itself, which is a valid approximation over a few gyrations).\nWith constant $\\gamma$ and mass $m$, the equation of motion is:\n$$ \\gamma m \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -e (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) $$\nWe decompose the electron's velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ into components parallel ($v_{||}$) and perpendicular ($v_{\\perp}$) to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$ v_{||} = v \\cos\\alpha $$\n$$ v_{\\perp} = v \\sin\\alpha $$\nThe parallel component of the force is zero, so $v_{||}$ is constant. The perpendicular component of the velocity experiences a force that leads to circular motion in the plane perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$. The combination of linear motion along $\\mathbf{B}$ and circular motion perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$ results in a helical trajectory.\n\nThe centripetal force for the circular motion is provided by the magnetic force:\n$$ \\gamma m a_{\\perp} = e v_{\\perp} B $$\nwhere $a_{\\perp}$ is the centripetal acceleration. For circular motion of radius $r_L$ (Larmor radius), $a_{\\perp} = v_{\\perp}^2 / r_L$.\n$$ \\gamma m \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{r_L} = e v_{\\perp} B $$\nThe angular frequency of this gyration, known as the relativistic cyclotron or gyration frequency $\\omega_g$, is given by $\\omega_g = v_{\\perp} / r_L$. From the force equation:\n$$ \\omega_g = \\frac{eB}{\\gamma m} $$\nThis is the fundamental frequency of the electron's orbital motion. However, due to relativistic beaming, an observer sees a spectrum of radiation that peaks at a much higher frequency. The characteristic frequency of synchrotron radiation is determined by the details of the short pulse of radiation observed as the electron's velocity vector sweeps past the observer's line of sight.\n\nIn the ultrarelativistic regime, the radiation is emitted into a narrow cone of angle $\\sim 1/\\gamma$ around the direction of the electron's instantaneous velocity. The characteristic angular frequency of the radiation spectrum, $\\omega_{char}$, is related to the radius of curvature, $\\rho$, of the electron's trajectory and its Lorentz factor $\\gamma$. The standard definition for the critical angular frequency, which characterizes the spectral peak, is:\n$$ \\omega_{c} = \\frac{3c\\gamma^3}{2\\rho} $$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light. To use this, we must find the radius of curvature $\\rho$ for the helical path.\n\nThe formula for the radius of curvature of a path described by a vector function $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{|\\mathbf{v}|^3}{|\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}|} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v} = \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}$ and $\\mathbf{a} = \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}$. We have $|\\mathbf{v}| = v$. The acceleration is $\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -\\frac{e}{\\gamma m}(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$.\nLet's compute the cross product $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{v} \\times \\left(-\\frac{e}{\\gamma m}(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\\right) = -\\frac{e}{\\gamma m} \\mathbf{v} \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) $$\nUsing the vector triple product identity $\\mathbf{A} \\times (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{C}) = \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}) - \\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a} = -\\frac{e}{\\gamma m} [\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})] $$\nWe have $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = v^2$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = vB\\cos\\alpha$.\n$$ \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a} = -\\frac{e}{\\gamma m} [vB\\cos\\alpha\\,\\mathbf{v} - v^2\\mathbf{B}] $$\nThe magnitude of this vector is:\n$$ |\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{e}{\\gamma m}\\right)^2 |v^2\\mathbf{B} - vB\\cos\\alpha\\,\\mathbf{v}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{e}{\\gamma m}\\right)^2 [ (v^2B)^2 - 2(v^2B)(vB\\cos\\alpha)(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}/(vB)) + (vB\\cos\\alpha)^2 v^2 ] $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{e}{\\gamma m}\\right)^2 [ v^4B^2 - 2v^4B^2\\cos^2\\alpha + v^4B^2\\cos^2\\alpha ] = \\left(\\frac{e}{\\gamma m}\\right)^2 v^4B^2(1-\\cos^2\\alpha) $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{e}{\\gamma m}\\right)^2 v^4B^2\\sin^2\\alpha $$\nTaking the square root, we get:\n$$ |\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}| = \\frac{e v^2 B \\sin\\alpha}{\\gamma m} $$\nNow we can find the radius of curvature:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{v^3}{|\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{a}|} = \\frac{v^3}{\\frac{e v^2 B \\sin\\alpha}{\\gamma m}} = \\frac{\\gamma m v}{e B \\sin\\alpha} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho$ into the formula for the critical frequency $\\omega_{c}$:\n$$ \\omega_{c} = \\frac{3c\\gamma^3}{2\\rho} = \\frac{3c\\gamma^3}{2 \\left( \\frac{\\gamma m v}{e B \\sin\\alpha} \\right)} $$\nIn the ultrarelativistic limit ($\\gamma \\gg 1$), the electron's speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light $c$. So we can approximate $v \\approx c$.\n$$ \\omega_{c} \\approx \\frac{3c\\gamma^3}{2 \\left( \\frac{\\gamma m c}{e B \\sin\\alpha} \\right)} = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{eB}{m} \\gamma^2 \\sin\\alpha $$\nThe characteristic synchrotron angular frequency $\\omega_{char}$ is therefore proportional to $B$, $\\gamma^2$, and $\\sin\\alpha$:\n$$ \\omega_{char} \\propto B \\gamma^2 \\sin\\alpha $$\n\n### Calculation of the Frequency Shift Factor\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the frequency shifts when the magnetic field is increased from $B_1 = 2\\,\\mathrm{T}$ to $B_2 = 6\\,\\mathrm{T}$, with $\\gamma$ and $\\alpha$ held constant.\nLet $\\omega_1$ be the characteristic frequency corresponding to $B_1$ and $\\omega_2$ be the frequency for $B_2$. Let the constant of proportionality be $K$.\n$$ \\omega_1 = K B_1 \\gamma^2 \\sin\\alpha $$\n$$ \\omega_2 = K B_2 \\gamma^2 \\sin\\alpha $$\nThe factor of the shift is the ratio $\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1} = \\frac{K B_2 \\gamma^2 \\sin\\alpha}{K B_1 \\gamma^2 \\sin\\alpha} = \\frac{B_2}{B_1} $$\nSubstituting the given values for the magnetic fields:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1} = \\frac{6\\,\\mathrm{T}}{2\\,\\mathrm{T}} = 3 $$\nThe characteristic frequency increases by a factor of $3$.",

The radiation originates from electron-impact excitation of impurity ions followed by radiative decay. The problem specifies that we only need to consider line radiation from the hydrogen-like carbon ion, $\\mathrm{C}^{5+}$, as the fully stripped ion, $\\mathrm{C}^{6+}$, has no electrons to excite.\n\nThe number density of the radiating species, $\\mathrm{C}^{5+}$, is a fraction $f_{5+}$ of the total carbon impurity density $n_Z$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} = f_{5+} n_Z$$\n\nThe problem is set in the coronal limit. In this model, it is assumed that every collisional excitation of an ion from its ground state to an excited state is followed by one or more radiative decays that return the ion to the ground state. Collisional de-excitation is negligible. This implies that the total energy radiated per excitation event is equal to the energy of the excited level relative to the ground state.\n\nThe rate of collisional excitations per unit volume from the ground state ($n=1$) to an excited state $n$ is given by the product of the densities of the colliding particles (electrons and C$^{5+}$ ions) and the excitation rate coefficient $q_{1\\to n}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{exc}, n} = n_e n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} q_{1\\to n}$$\n\nThe power radiated per unit volume, $P_{\\mathrm{rad}, n}$, due to excitations to level $n$ is this rate multiplied by the energy released per event, $\\Delta E_{n1}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{rad}, n} = R_{\\mathrm{exc}, n} \\Delta E_{n1} = n_e n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\n\nThe total line-radiation power density, $P_{\\mathrm{rad}}$, is the sum of the power radiated from all considered excited levels ($n=2, 3, 4$ in this case):\n$$P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\sum_{n=2}^{4} P_{\\mathrm{rad}, n} = \\sum_{n=2}^{4} n_e n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\nSubstituting $n_{\\mathrm{C}^{5+}} = f_{5+} n_Z$, we get:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = n_e n_Z f_{5+} \\sum_{n=2}^{4} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\n\nThe problem defines the impurity cooling function, $\\Lambda(T_e)$, through the relation $P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = n_e n_Z \\Lambda(T_e)$. By comparing this with our expression for $P_{\\mathrm{rad}}$, we can derive the expression for $\\Lambda(T_e)$:\n$$n_e n_Z \\Lambda(T_e) = n_e n_Z f_{5+} \\sum_{n=2}^{4} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\n$$\\Lambda(T_e) = f_{5+} \\sum_{n=2}^{4} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1}$$\nThis is the requested expression for the cooling function.

The energy levels are given by the hydrogenic formula $E_n = -Z^2 R_\\infty / n^2$, with $Z=6$ and $R_\\infty = 13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe energy difference is:\n$$\\Delta E_{n1} = \\left(-\\frac{Z^2 R_\\infty}{1^2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{Z^2 R_\\infty}{n^2}\\right) = Z^2 R_\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)$$\nWe calculate this for $n=2, 3, 4$:\nFor $n=2$:\n$$\\Delta E_{21} = 6^2 \\times (13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2^2}\\right) = 36 \\times 13.6 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 367.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nFor $n=3$:\n$$\\Delta E_{31} = 6^2 \\times (13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3^2}\\right) = 36 \\times 13.6 \\times \\frac{8}{9} = 435.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nFor $n=4$:\n$$\\Delta E_{41} = 6^2 \\times (13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4^2}\\right) = 36 \\times 13.6 \\times \\frac{15}{16} = 459.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nNow we compute the sum in the expression for $\\Lambda(T_e)$. The energies must be converted to Joules using the elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.602177 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{n=2}^{4} q_{1\\to n} \\Delta E_{n1} = q_{1\\to 2}\\Delta E_{21} + q_{1\\to 3}\\Delta E_{31} + q_{1\\to 4}\\Delta E_{41}$.\nUsing the given rate coefficients:\n$q_{1\\to 2} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n$q_{1\\to 3} = 0.7 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n$q_{1\\to 4} = 0.3 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nThe sum in units of $\\mathrm{eV\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}}$ is:\n$$ \\sum q \\Delta E = (2.0 \\times 10^{-14})(367.2) + (0.7 \\times 10^{-14})(435.2) + (0.3 \\times 10^{-14})(459.0) $$\n$$ \\sum q \\Delta E = (734.4 + 304.64 + 137.7) \\times 10^{-14} = 1176.74 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\sum q \\Delta E = 1.17674 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\n\nNow we calculate a numerical value for the cooling function $\\Lambda(T_e)$. We multiply by the fraction $f_{5+} = 0.10$ and convert the energy unit to Joules.\n$$ \\Lambda(T_e) = f_{5+} \\left( \\sum q \\Delta E \\right) = 0.10 \\times (1.17674 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (1.602177 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) $$\n$$ \\Lambda(T_e) \\approx 1.88528 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^3\\,s^{-1}} = 1.88528 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^3} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the total impurity line-radiation power density $P_{\\mathrm{rad}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = n_e n_Z \\Lambda(T_e) $$\nUsing the given densities $n_e = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$ and $n_Z = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}) \\times (1.88528 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^3}) $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{36}) \\times (1.88528 \\times 10^{-31})\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}} $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 1.88528 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}} $$",
