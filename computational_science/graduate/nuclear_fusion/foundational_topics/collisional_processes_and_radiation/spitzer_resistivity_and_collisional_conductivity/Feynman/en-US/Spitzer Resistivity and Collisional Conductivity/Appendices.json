Electrical resistivity in this regime is controlled by electron–ion momentum exchange. Starting from kinetic theory and the electron momentum balance, reason from first principles why the collisional friction that sets the electrical conductivity depends on the squared ion charge and motivates defining an effective ion charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that parameterizes the impact of a mixture of ion species and charge states on collisional conductivity.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. It is based on standard, verifiable principles of plasma physics. Therefore, it is deemed valid, and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, a theoretical motivation for the dependence of collisional friction on the squared ion charge ($Z^2$) and the definition of the effective ion charge ($Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$); second, a numerical calculation of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for a given plasma composition.\n\n### Part 1: Theoretical Motivation\n\nIn a weakly collisional, fully ionized plasma, electrical resistivity arises from the transfer of momentum from current-carrying electrons to the much heavier, and thus relatively stationary, ions. This momentum transfer occurs through long-range Coulomb collisions.\n\nLet us consider the steady-state momentum balance equation for the electron fluid in the presence of an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. The electric field exerts a force on the electrons, accelerating them. This directed motion is opposed by a frictional drag force, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{friction}}$, resulting from collisions with ions. In a steady state, these forces balance. The force on a single electron is $-e\\mathbf{E}$, where $-e$ is the electron charge. The total electric force per unit volume on the electron fluid is $n_e (-e)\\mathbf{E}$, where $n_e$ is the electron number density. The total frictional force per unit volume is the sum of momentum transfer rates from electrons to all ion species, which we denote as $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$. The momentum balance is:\n$$\nn_e (-e)\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{R}_{ei} = 0\n$$\nThe electrical current density, $\\mathbf{j}$, is carried primarily by the electrons, so $\\mathbf{j} = n_e (-e) \\mathbf{v}_d$, where $\\mathbf{v}_d$ is the electron drift velocity relative to the ions. The frictional force $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$ is proportional to this drift velocity. Specifically, for collisions with a single ion species $j$, the frictional force is $\\mathbf{R}_{ei,j} = -n_e m_e \\nu_{ei,j} \\mathbf{v}_d$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass and $\\nu_{ei,j}$ is the momentum-transfer collision frequency for electrons with ions of species $j$.\n\nThe total frictional force is the sum over all ion species present in the plasma:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{ei} = \\sum_j \\mathbf{R}_{ei,j} = -n_e m_e \\mathbf{v}_d \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j}\n$$\nThe crux of the argument lies in how the collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei,j}$, depends on the properties of the ion species, particularly its charge, $Z_j e$. The fundamental interaction is Rutherford scattering. The force between an electron and an ion of charge $Z_j e$ is given by Coulomb's law, which is proportional to the product of the charges, i.e., proportional to $Z_j$.\n\nThe scattering of an electron by an ion results in a change in the electron's momentum. The momentum transfer in a single collision depends on the scattering angle. For small-angle scattering, which dominates in a plasma, the change in perpendicular momentum is proportional to the force, and thus proportional to $Z_j$. The differential cross-section for Rutherford scattering is proportional to the square of the term describing the interaction strength:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\left( Z_j e^2 \\right)^2 = Z_j^2 e^4\n$$\nThe momentum-transfer collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei,j}$, is obtained by integrating the momentum transfer over all impact parameters, weighted by the ion density $n_j$ and averaged over the electron velocity distribution. This process yields a collision frequency that is directly proportional to the ion density $n_j$ and the square of the ion charge $Z_j^2$:\n$$\n\\nu_{ei,j} \\propto n_j Z_j^2\n$$\nThe full expression for the electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency for a Maxwellian electron distribution with temperature $T_e$ is given by:\n$$\n\\nu_{ei,j} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_j Z_j^2 e^4 \\ln\\Lambda}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\ln\\Lambda$ is the Coulomb logarithm, $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The key dependencies are $\\nu_{ei,j} \\propto n_j Z_j^2$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the momentum balance equation:\n$$\nn_e (-e)\\mathbf{E} - n_e m_e \\mathbf{v}_d \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j} = 0\n$$\nUsing $\\mathbf{v}_d = \\mathbf{j} / (-n_e e)$, we get:\n$$\nn_e (-e)\\mathbf{E} - n_e m_e \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{-n_e e}\\right) \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-n_e e \\mathbf{E} + \\frac{m_e}{e} \\left( \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j} \\right) \\mathbf{j} = 0\n$$\nRearranging for Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{j}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\left[ \\frac{m_e}{n_e e^2} \\sum_j \\nu_{ei,j} \\right] \\mathbf{j}\n$$\nThe term in the brackets is the plasma resistivity, $\\eta$. Since $\\nu_{ei,j} \\propto n_j Z_j^2$, the resistivity is proportional to the sum over all ion species weighted by their density and charge squared:\n$$\n\\eta \\propto \\frac{1}{n_e} \\sum_j n_j Z_j^2\n$$\nThis result motivates the definition of an effective ion charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. We wish to describe the complex multi-species plasma as if it were a simpler plasma with only one type of ion with an effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, such that it produces the same total collisional friction. The definition that achieves this and simplifies the resistivity expression is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2}{\\sum_j n_j Z_j}\n$$\nThe denominator, $\\sum_j n_j Z_j$, is, by the condition of quasineutrality, equal to the total positive charge density, which must balance the electron charge density. Thus, $n_e = \\sum_j n_j Z_j$. Substituting this into the definition gives:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2}{n_e}\n$$\nWith this definition, the expression for resistivity simplifies elegantly. The summation term $\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2$ can be replaced by $n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The resistivity becomes:\n$$\n\\eta \\propto \\frac{1}{n_e} (n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nThus, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is a dimensionless parameter that represents the average collisionality of the ion mixture as experienced by the electrons. It directly scales the plasma resistivity and is a crucial parameter in determining plasma purity and performance in fusion devices.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$\n\nWe will now compute $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the provided data for the plasma composition. The formula is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2}{n_e} = \\frac{\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2}{\\sum_j n_j Z_j}\n$$\nThe sum is over all ion species: Deuterium (D), Tritium (T), Helium (He), Carbon (C), and the three charge states of Tungsten (W).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number density for each tungsten charge state:\n$n_{24} = f_{24} n_{\\mathrm{W}} = 0.20 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$n_{30} = f_{30} n_{\\mathrm{W}} = 0.50 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$n_{38} = f_{38} n_{\\mathrm{W}} = 0.30 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 3.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the total electron density $n_e = \\sum_j n_j Z_j$:\n\\begin{align*}\nn_e = & \\ n_{\\mathrm{D}} Z_{\\mathrm{D}} + n_{\\mathrm{T}} Z_{\\mathrm{T}} + n_{\\mathrm{He}} Z_{\\mathrm{He}} + n_{\\mathrm{C}} Z_{\\mathrm{C}} + n_{24} Z_{24} + n_{30} Z_{30} + n_{38} Z_{38} \\\\\n= & \\ (4.0 \\times 10^{19})(1) + (4.0 \\times 10^{19})(1) + (1.0 \\times 10^{19})(2) + (2.0 \\times 10^{18})(6) \\\\\n& + (2.0 \\times 10^{15})(24) + (5.0 \\times 10^{15})(30) + (3.0 \\times 10^{15})(38) \\\\\n= & \\ 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + 2.0 \\times 10^{19} + 1.2 \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n& + 4.8 \\times 10^{16} + 1.5 \\times 10^{17} + 1.14 \\times 10^{17} \\\\\n= & \\ (4.0 + 4.0 + 2.0 + 1.2) \\times 10^{19} + (0.0048 + 0.0150 + 0.0114) \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n= & \\ (11.2 + 0.0312) \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n= & \\ 11.2312 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator, $\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2 = & \\ n_{\\mathrm{D}} Z_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{T}} Z_{\\mathrm{T}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{He}} Z_{\\mathrm{He}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{C}} Z_{\\mathrm{C}}^2 + n_{24} Z_{24}^2 + n_{30} Z_{30}^2 + n_{38} Z_{38}^2 \\\\\n= & \\ (4.0 \\times 10^{19})(1^2) + (4.0 \\times 10^{19})(1^2) + (1.0 \\times 10^{19})(2^2) + (2.0 \\times 10^{18})(6^2) \\\\\n& + (2.0 \\times 10^{15})(24^2) + (5.0 \\times 10^{15})(30^2) + (3.0 \\times 10^{15})(38^2) \\\\\n= & \\ 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + 4.0 \\times 10^{19} + (2.0 \\times 10^{18})(36) \\\\\n& + (2.0 \\times 10^{15})(576) + (5.0 \\times 10^{15})(900) + (3.0 \\times 10^{15})(1444) \\\\\n= & \\ 12.0 \\times 10^{19} + 7.2 \\times 10^{19} + 1.152 \\times 10^{18} + 4.5 \\times 10^{18} + 4.332 \\times 10^{18} \\\\\n= & \\ 19.2 \\times 10^{19} + (0.1152 + 0.4500 + 0.4332) \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n= & \\ (19.2 + 0.9984) \\times 10^{19} \\\\\n= & \\ 20.1984 \\times 10^{19}\n\\end{align*}\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio to find $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{20.1984 \\times 10^{19}}{11.2312 \\times 10^{19}} = \\frac{20.1984}{11.2312} \\approx 1.798418\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.798$.

For instance, it is not \"pseudo-profound or trivial\" because deriving the scaling from momentum balance, while a standard exercise, requires a non-trivial application of physical principles.\n\n3.  **Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the steady-state momentum balance equation for the electron fluid. In an unmagnetized plasma subject to a steady electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, the electric force on the electrons is balanced by the frictional drag from collisions with ions. The force density on the electron fluid from the electric field is $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{E}} = -n_e e \\mathbf{E}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. The frictional force density due to electron-ion collisions is denoted by $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$.\n\nIn steady state ($\\frac{d}{dt} = 0$), the momentum equation is:\n$$0 = -n_e e \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{R}_{ei}$$\n\nThe collisional friction force $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$ represents the rate of momentum transfer from the electron fluid to the ion fluid. It is proportional to the relative drift velocity between the species and the momentum-transfer collision frequency. Assuming the massive ions are approximately stationary compared to the drifting electrons, the friction force density can be written as:\n$$\\mathbf{R}_{ei} = -n_e m_e \\nu_{ei} \\mathbf{v}_d$$\nwhere $m_e$ is the electron mass, $\\mathbf{v}_d$ is the average drift velocity of the electrons, and $\\nu_{ei}$ is the effective electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency.\n\nThe electric current density $\\mathbf{j}$ is carried primarily by the electrons and is given by:\n$$\\mathbf{j} = -n_e e \\mathbf{v}_d$$\nWe can express the drift velocity in terms of the current density:\n$$\\mathbf{v}_d = -\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{n_e e}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathbf{R}_{ei}$:\n$$\\mathbf{R}_{ei} = -n_e m_e \\nu_{ei} \\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{n_e e}\\right) = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{e} \\mathbf{j}$$\nNow, substituting this back into the momentum balance equation:\n$$n_e e \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{e} \\mathbf{j}$$\nRearranging to the form of Ohm's Law, $\\mathbf{j} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\\mathbf{j} = \\left(\\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\nu_{ei}}\\right) \\mathbf{E}$$\nFrom this, we identify the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\nu_{ei}}$$\nThe collisional resistivity, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}$, is the inverse of the conductivity:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} = \\sigma^{-1} = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2}$$\nThe temperature dependence of the resistivity is determined by the temperature dependence of the collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei}$. The problem specifies using the kinetic description of electron-ion small-angle Coulomb scattering. For an electron with velocity $v$ moving through a field of ions of density $n_i$ and charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} e$, the momentum-transfer collision frequency scales as $\\nu(v) \\propto n_i Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2 / v^3$. For a Maxwellian plasma, we average this over the electron velocity distribution. A characteristic velocity for electrons is the thermal velocity, $v_{th,e}$, which is related to the temperature by $\\frac{1}{2}m_e v_{th,e}^2 \\propto k_B T_e$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Thus, $v_{th,e} \\propto T_e^{1/2}$.\n\nThe effective collision frequency for the entire electron population will therefore scale as:\n$$\\nu_{ei} \\propto v_{th,e}^{-3} \\propto (T_e^{1/2})^{-3} = T_e^{-3/2}$$\nMore formally, the electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency is given by:\n$$\\nu_{ei} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_i Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^2 e^4 \\ln\\Lambda}{m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}$$\nUsing the quasineutrality condition $n_e = Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} n_i$, we can write this in terms of $n_e$:\n$$\\nu_{ei} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} e^4 \\ln\\Lambda}{m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\nu_{ei}$ into the formula for resistivity:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} = \\frac{m_e}{n_e e^2} \\left( \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} e^4 \\ln\\Lambda}{m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}} \\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression yields:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{m_e^{1/2} e^2 Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ln\\Lambda}{(k_B T_e)^{3/2}}$$\nA more rigorous kinetic treatment using the Fokker-Planck equation introduces a numerical factor $\\gamma_E(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}})$ that accounts for electron-electron collisions and the details of the velocity distribution perturbation. However, since $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is held constant, this factor is also constant and does not affect the scaling with temperature.\n\nThe problem states that $n_e$, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and $\\ln\\Lambda$ are held constant. All other terms ($m_e$, $e$, $k_B$) are fundamental constants. Therefore, the scaling of Spitzer resistivity with electron temperature is:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} \\propto T_e^{-3/2}$$\nThis shows that as the plasma gets hotter, it becomes a better conductor (less resistive), because faster electrons are deflected less by collisions with ions.\n\nNow, we compute the required quantities. Let $\\eta_1$ be the initial resistivity at temperature $T_1 = T_e$, and $\\eta_2$ be the final resistivity at temperature $T_2 = 2 T_e$.\n\nThe multiplicative factor by which $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}$ changes is the ratio $\\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1}$. Using the scaling law:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1} = \\frac{C \\cdot (T_2)^{-3/2}}{C \\cdot (T_1)^{-3/2}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-3/2}$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of proportionality. Substituting $T_2 = 2T_1$:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1} = \\left(\\frac{2T_1}{T_1}\\right)^{-3/2} = 2^{-3/2} = \\frac{1}{2^{3/2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nThe corresponding percentage change, expressed as a decimal, is:\n$$\\text{Change} = \\frac{\\eta_2 - \\eta_1}{\\eta_1} = \\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1} - 1 = 2^{-3/2} - 1$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$2^{-3/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.41421356} \\approx \\frac{1}{2.82842712} \\approx 0.35355339$$\nThe change is therefore:\n$$\\text{Change} \\approx 0.35355339 - 1 = -0.64644661$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives $-0.6464$. The negative sign indicates a decrease in resistivity of approximately $64.64\\%$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the multiplicative factor and the percentage change as a decimal.",

The output must thus be a single string that looks like a Python list of lists of floats, and it must be the only line printed by the program.",
            "solution": "The problem posed is to compute the classical collisional electrical conductivity tensor components for a magnetized plasma, starting from a simplified electron momentum balance equation and fundamental principles for the collision parameters. The problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided to derive a unique solution based on the specified physical model.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Conductivity Tensor\n\nThe starting point is the steady-state electron momentum balance equation provided:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{0} = - e n_e (\\boldsymbol{E} + \\boldsymbol{v}_e \\times \\boldsymbol{B}) - m_e n_e \\nu_{ei} \\boldsymbol{v}_e\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $n_e$ is the electron number density, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $\\boldsymbol{E}$ is the electric field, $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\\boldsymbol{v}_e$ is the mean electron drift velocity, and $\\nu_{ei}$ is the effective electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency.\n\nThe electron current density is given by $\\boldsymbol{J} = - e n_e \\boldsymbol{v}_e$. We can express $\\boldsymbol{v}_e$ in terms of $\\boldsymbol{J}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{v}_e = -\\frac{\\boldsymbol{J}}{e n_e}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the momentum balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{0} = - e n_e \\boldsymbol{E} - e n_e \\left(-\\frac{\\boldsymbol{J}}{e n_e}\\right) \\times \\boldsymbol{B} - m_e n_e \\nu_{ei} \\left(-\\frac{\\boldsymbol{J}}{e n_e}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{0} = - e n_e \\boldsymbol{E} + \\boldsymbol{J} \\times \\boldsymbol{B} + \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{e} \\boldsymbol{J}\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$ gives Ohm's law in terms of the resistivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E} = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2} \\boldsymbol{J} + \\frac{1}{n_e e} \\boldsymbol{B} \\times \\boldsymbol{J} = \\boldsymbol{\\eta} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}\n$$\nThe problem requires the conductivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, which is the inverse of the resistivity tensor, $\\boldsymbol{J} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E}$. We will solve for the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ by inverting the relation.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system where the magnetic field is aligned with the z-axis, $\\boldsymbol{B} = B \\hat{z}$. The vector equation can be written in component form. The term $\\boldsymbol{B} \\times \\boldsymbol{J} = (B J_y, -B J_x, 0)$.\n$$\nE_x = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2} J_x + \\frac{B}{n_e e} J_y\n$$\n$$\nE_y = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2} J_y - \\frac{B}{n_e e} J_x\n$$\n$$\nE_z = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2} J_z\n$$\n\nFrom the z-component equation, we can directly find the parallel conductivity, $\\sigma_\\parallel$:\n$$\nJ_z = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\nu_{ei}} E_z \\quad \\implies \\quad \\sigma_\\parallel = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\nu_{ei}}\n$$\n\nThe x and y components represent the physics perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{B}$. We can write them in matrix form $\\boldsymbol{E}_\\perp = \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_\\perp \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}_\\perp$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} E_x \\\\ E_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2} & \\frac{B}{n_e e} \\\\ -\\frac{B}{n_e e} & \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} J_x \\\\ J_y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe perpendicular conductivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_\\perp$ is the inverse of $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_\\perp$. The components of $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_\\perp$ are the perpendicular (Pedersen) resistivity $\\eta_\\perp = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_\\parallel}$ and the Hall resistivity $\\eta_\\wedge = -\\frac{B}{n_e e}$. The tensor is usually written with positive Hall term, so we take $\\eta_\\wedge = \\frac{B}{n_e e}$. So,\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_\\perp = \\begin{pmatrix} \\eta_\\perp & \\eta_\\wedge \\\\ -\\eta_\\wedge & \\eta_\\perp \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nInverting this matrix:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_\\perp = \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_\\perp^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\eta_\\perp^2 + \\eta_\\wedge^2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\eta_\\perp & -\\eta_\\wedge \\\\ \\eta_\\wedge & \\eta_\\perp \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_\\perp & -\\sigma_\\wedge \\\\ \\sigma_\\wedge & \\sigma_\\perp \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the conductivity tensor are thus:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\perp = \\frac{\\eta_\\perp}{\\eta_\\perp^2 + \\eta_\\wedge^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sigma_\\wedge = \\frac{\\eta_\\wedge}{\\eta_\\perp^2 + \\eta_\\wedge^2}\n$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $\\eta_\\perp$ and $\\eta_\\wedge$. Let's also use the electron cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce} = e B / m_e$. Then $\\eta_\\wedge = \\frac{B}{n_e e} = \\frac{m_e \\omega_{ce}}{n_e e^2}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_\\perp = \\frac{\\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2}}{(\\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2})^2 + (\\frac{m_e \\omega_{ce}}{n_e e^2})^2} = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e} \\frac{\\nu_{ei}}{\\nu_{ei}^2 + \\omega_{ce}^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_\\wedge = \\frac{\\frac{m_e \\omega_{ce}}{n_e e^2}}{(\\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2})^2 + (\\frac{m_e \\omega_{ce}}{n_e e^2})^2} = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e} \\frac{\\omega_{ce}}{\\nu_{ei}^2 + \\omega_{ce}^2}\n$$\nThese can be expressed in terms of the parallel conductivity $\\sigma_\\parallel$ and the Hall parameter $x = \\omega_{ce}/\\nu_{ei}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\perp = \\sigma_\\parallel \\frac{\\nu_{ei}^2}{\\nu_{ei}^2 + \\omega_{ce}^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\parallel}{1 + (\\omega_{ce}/\\nu_{ei})^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_\\wedge = \\sigma_\\parallel \\frac{\\nu_{ei} \\omega_{ce}}{\\nu_{ei}^2 + \\omega_{ce}^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\parallel (\\omega_{ce}/\\nu_{ei})}{1 + (\\omega_{ce}/\\nu_{ei})^2}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Collision Frequency and Parameters\n\nThe problem specifies how to calculate the parameters for the collision frequency, which itself is described as arising from integration over small-angle scattering in a Maxwellian plasma. The standard theoretical result for the electron-ion momentum-transfer collision frequency under these conditions is:\n$$\n\\nu_{ei} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\frac{n_e Z_{\\rm eff} e^4 \\ln \\Lambda}{(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0)^2 m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}}\n$$\nwhere $Z_{\\rm eff} = (\\sum_j n_j Z_j^2) / n_e$ is the effective ion charge, $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_e$ is the electron temperature. The Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln \\Lambda$, is calculated as prescribed:\n$$\n\\ln \\Lambda = \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_D}{b_{\\min}} \\right)\n$$\nwith the following definitions:\n- Electron thermal energy: $E_{th} = k_B T_e$. Since $T_e$ is given in eV, $E_{th} = T_e[\\mathrm{eV}] \\times e$.\n- Electron thermal speed: $v_{th} = \\sqrt{2 k_B T_e / m_e} = \\sqrt{2 E_{th} / m_e}$.\n- Debye length: $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 E_{th}}{n_e e^2}}$.\n- Minimum impact parameter $b_{\\min} = \\max(b_{90}, b_q)$, where:\n    - Classical distance of closest approach for $90^\\circ$ scattering: $b_{90} = \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 m_e v_{th}^2} = \\frac{e^2}{8 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 E_{th}}$.\n    - Quantum (de Broglie) thermal wavelength scale: $b_q = \\frac{\\hbar}{m_e v_{th}}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n### Part 3: Implementation Strategy\n\nThe program will implement the derived formulas in a step-by-step manner for each test case.\n1. Define universal physical constants in SI units.\n2. For each test case $[n_e, T_e(\\text{eV}), Z_{\\rm eff}, B]$:\n    a. Convert electron temperature $T_e$ to thermal energy $E_{th}$ in Joules.\n    b. Calculate $v_{th}$, $\\lambda_D$, $b_{90}$, and $b_q$.\n    c. Determine $b_{\\min}$ and compute the Coulomb logarithm $\\ln \\Lambda$.\n    d. Calculate the electron-ion collision frequency $\\nu_{ei}$ using the theoretical formula.\n    e. Calculate the electron cyclotron frequency $\\omega_{ce} = eB/m_e$.\n    f. Compute $\\sigma_\\parallel = n_e e^2 / (m_e \\nu_{ei})$.\n    g. Compute $\\sigma_\\perp$ and $\\sigma_\\wedge$ using the derived relations involving the ratio $\\omega_{ce}/\\nu_{ei}$.\n    h. For the case $B=0$, $\\omega_{ce}=0$, leading to $\\sigma_\\perp = \\sigma_\\parallel$ and $\\sigma_\\wedge=0$. The formulas are robust in this limit.\n3. Format the results as a list of lists, with each number in scientific notation to six significant digits.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the calculation is transparent, physically grounded in the problem's specified model, and computationally correct.",
