This practice introduces the essential technique of comparing atomic timescales, like $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, with the transport timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}}$. By calculating their ratio, you will determine whether the impurity is in 'coronal equilibrium' or if its charge state is 'frozen-in' as it moves, a distinction that is critical for accurately predicting impurity radiation and the potential for radiation collapse .",

            "problem": "A trace high-atomic-number impurity is introduced into a magnetically confined fusion plasma. Consider a single adjacent-charge-state transition for an impurity in charge state $i$ at electron temperature $T_e$, with electron number density $n_e$ and Maxwellian-averaged electron-impact ionization rate coefficient $S_i(T_e)$ for $i \\to i+1$, and total recombination rate coefficient $\\alpha_i(T_e)$ for $i \\to i-1$ (including radiative plus dielectronic recombination). The fractional abundance of charge state $i$, denoted $f_i$, evolves under electron collisions and plasma transport. Starting from first principles, use the law of mass action for collisional processes and a local continuity model for $f_i$ to derive expressions for the characteristic ionization equilibration timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ and the recombination equilibration timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ in terms of $n_e$, $S_i$, and $\\alpha_i$. Then, define a dimensionless diagnostic\n$$\n\\Xi \\equiv \\frac{\\max\\{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ion}},\\,\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}\\}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}}$ is a transport timescale across a characteristic radial distance $L$ under a measured mean radial convective speed $v_r$, so that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}} = L/v_r$ follows from $v = dx/dt$.\n\nFor a tungsten impurity near the core, take $n_e = 7.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $T_e = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, $S_i(T_e) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s}$, $\\alpha_i(T_e) = 2.5 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s}$, $L = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $v_r = 30\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of characteristic atomic physics timescales, the calculation of a dimensionless parameter $\\Xi$ that compares these timescales to a transport timescale, and a discussion of the physical implications for impurity behavior in a fusion plasma.\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions for the ionization and recombination equilibration timescales from first principles. The law of mass action for collisional processes states that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the densities of the reactants. We are considering an impurity ion in charge state $i$ within a plasma with electron density $n_e$.\n\nThe process of electron-impact ionization, $I^i + e^- \\to I^{i+1} + 2e^-$, causes a loss of ions in state $i$. The rate of this process, in terms of the change in the number density of state $i$, $n_i$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dn_i}{dt}\\bigg|_{\\text{ion}} = -n_e n_i S_i(T_e) $$\nwhere $S_i(T_e)$ is the electron-impact ionization rate coefficient. This is a first-order decay process for the population $n_i$. The characteristic time for this decay is the inverse of the rate constant. The rate per ion of species $i$ is $n_e S_i$. Therefore, the characteristic ionization equilibration timescale, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, is the e-folding time for this process:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{ion}} = \\frac{1}{n_e S_i} $$\nSimilarly, the process of recombination, $I^i + e^- \\to I^{i-1} + h\\nu$, also causes a loss of ions in state $i$. The problem specifies a total recombination rate coefficient $\\alpha_i(T_e)$ for the transition $i \\to i-1$. The rate of change of $n_i$ due to this process is:\n$$ \\frac{dn_i}{dt}\\bigg|_{\\text{rec}} = -n_e n_i \\alpha_i(T_e) $$\nThe rate of recombination per ion of species $i$ is $n_e \\alpha_i$. The characteristic recombination equilibration timescale, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}} = \\frac{1}{n_e \\alpha_i} $$\nThese expressions are derived from a local continuity model considering only the specified collisional loss channels.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for these timescales using the provided data:\n- Electron density, $n_e = 7.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Ionization rate coefficient, $S_i = 1.2 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s}$\n- Recombination rate coefficient, $\\alpha_i = 2.5 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s}$\n\nThe ionization timescale is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{ion}} = \\frac{1}{(7.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) (1.2 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s})} = \\frac{1}{8.4 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 1.19048 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe recombination timescale is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}} = \\frac{1}{(7.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) (2.5 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\\mathrm{/s})} = \\frac{1}{1.75 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 5.71429 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nWe then compute the transport timescale, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}}$, defined as $\\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}} = L/v_r$.\n- Characteristic radial distance, $L = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Mean radial convective speed, $v_r = 30\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nThe transport timescale is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}} = \\frac{0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}}{30\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nNow we can compute the dimensionless diagnostic parameter $\\Xi$:\n$$ \\Xi \\equiv \\frac{\\max\\{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ion}},\\,\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}\\}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{trans}}} $$\nFirst, we find the maximum of the two atomic timescales:\n$$ \\max\\{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ion}},\\,\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}\\} = \\max\\{1.19048 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}, 5.71429 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}\\} = 5.71429 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nSubstituting the values into the expression for $\\Xi$:\n$$ \\Xi = \\frac{5.71429 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 5.71429 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Xi = 5.714 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the physical implications. The parameter $\\Xi$ compares the longest atomic equilibration timescale to the transport timescale.\n- If $\\Xi \\gg 1$, the transport is much faster than atomic processes. Impurity ions would be convected across the plasma region faster than their charge state can adjust to the new local electron temperature and density. This is the **frozen-in charge state approximation**.\n- If $\\Xi \\ll 1$, atomic processes are much faster than transport. The impurity charge state distribution has ample time to equilibrate to the local plasma conditions at each point along its path. This is the **coronal equilibrium approximation**.\n\nIn our case, $\\Xi \\approx 5.7 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$. This indicates that the atomic timescales ($\\sim 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$) are about five orders of magnitude shorter than the transport timescale ($\\sim 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}$). Therefore, the frozen-in charge state approximation is strongly violated. The system is firmly in the coronal equilibrium regime, where the charge state abundances are determined by the local balance of ionization and recombination, i.e., $f_i(T_e(r), n_e(r))$.\n\nThis result has significant consequences for impurity radiation and plasma stability. Tungsten (W) is a high-atomic-number (high-Z) element that is not fully ionized even at core fusion temperatures. The given temperature, $T_e = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, is relatively low for a reactor core, meaning the tungsten ions will be in intermediate charge states that are very strong line radiators.\n\nBecause the system is in coronal equilibrium ($\\Xi \\ll 1$), the charge state distribution will rapidly adjust to any changes in the local electron temperature. This sets up the potential for a thermal instability known as **radiation collapse**. If the tungsten concentration increases to a critical level, the power radiated by the impurities, $P_{\\mathrm{rad}}$, can exceed the local plasma heating power, $P_{\\mathrm{heat}}$. This leads to a drop in $T_e$. As $T_e$ drops, the ionization rates decrease sharply, causing the tungsten ions to recombine to lower charge states. For high-Z elements in this temperature range, these lower charge states often radiate even more efficiently, increasing $P_{\\mathrm{rad}}$. This creates a positive feedback loop: cooling $\\to$ recombination $\\to$ increased radiation $\\to$ further cooling. This can lead to a rapid and localized quenching of the plasma temperature, potentially terminating the fusion burn. The fact that $\\Xi \\ll 1$ ensures that the impurity radiation is \"maximized\" for the local conditions, making the plasma more susceptible to this instability. The screening effects influencing impurity transport ($v_r$) are themselves dependent on plasma gradients, and a radiation-induced profile modification can, in turn, enhance impurity accumulation, compounding the problem. Thus, the small value of $\\Xi$ flags a high risk of radiation-driven plasma performance degradation or collapse if tungsten is not effectively controlled.",

The density at the magnetic axis ($\\psi=0$) is\n$$ n_z(0) = n_1(0) = C_1 \\exp(0) = C_1 $$\n$$ n_z(0) = S_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-k\\psi_s)}{V_z} + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Lambda} - \\frac{1}{V_z}\\right) \\exp(-k\\psi_a) \\right] $$\nThe density at the separatrix ($\\psi=\\psi_a$) is\n$$ n_z(\\psi_a) = \\frac{S_0}{\\Lambda} $$\nThe peaking factor $P$ is the ratio of these two densities:\n$$ P = \\frac{n_z(0)}{n_z(\\psi_a)} = \\frac{S_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-k\\psi_s)}{V_z} + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Lambda} - \\frac{1}{V_z}\\right) \\exp(-k\\psi_a) \\right]}{S_0/\\Lambda} $$\nThe source strength $S_0$ cancels out:\n$$ P = \\Lambda \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-k\\psi_s)}{V_z} + \\frac{\\exp(-k\\psi_a)}{\\Lambda} - \\frac{\\exp(-k\\psi_a)}{V_z} \\right] $$\n$$ P = \\frac{\\Lambda}{V_z} \\exp(-k\\psi_s) + \\exp(-k\\psi_a) - \\frac{\\Lambda}{V_z} \\exp(-k\\psi_a) $$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$ P = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda}{V_z}\\right) \\exp(-k\\psi_a) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{V_z} \\exp(-k\\psi_s) $$\nFinally, substituting back $k = V_z/D_z$:\n$$ P = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Lambda}{V_z}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_z}{D_z}\\psi_a\\right) + \\frac{\\Lambda}{V_z} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_z}{D_z}\\psi_s\\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the impurity peaking factor in terms of the given parameters.",
