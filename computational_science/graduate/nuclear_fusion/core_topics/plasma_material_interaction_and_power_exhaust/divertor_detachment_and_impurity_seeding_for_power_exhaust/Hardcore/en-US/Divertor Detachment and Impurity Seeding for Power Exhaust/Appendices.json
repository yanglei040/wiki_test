This exercise uses a fundamental energy balance model to calculate the fraction of power that must be dissipated before it reaches the divertor surfaces in a reactor-scale tokamak .

            "problem": "A burning-plasma tokamak reactor operates with a divertor configuration intended to achieve detachment via impurity seeding for power exhaust. The \"power-to-surface area\" challenge, abbreviated as $P/S$, refers to the disparity between the power flowing across the magnetic separatrix into the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) and the limited wetted area available on the divertor targets to absorb that power without exceeding material limits. In an advanced all-metal wall scenario (no carbon), the allowable steady-state peak target heat flux is constrained by the thermal and structural limits of tungsten monoblocks and embedded cooling.\n\nConsider a reactor with total power crossing the separatrix of $P_{\\text{sep}} = 150 \\ \\mathrm{MW}$. A fraction $\\phi$ of the non-radiated power reaching the divertor strikes the outer target; take $\\phi = 0.70$. The outer divertor wetted area is $S_{\\text{out}} = 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$. Toroidal and poloidal nonuniformities produce a peaking factor $p = 1.50$, defined so that the peak target heat flux $q_{t}$ satisfies $q_{t} = p \\, \\overline{q}_{t}$, where $\\overline{q}_{t}$ is the area-averaged target heat flux over $S_{\\text{out}}$. A fraction $f_{\\text{rad}}$ of $P_{\\text{sep}}$ is radiated volumetrically in the SOL and divertor before reaching the targets due to impurity line radiation and recombination (detachment).\n\nUsing energy conservation and geometric considerations of power spreading, derive an analytic expression for the minimum $f_{\\text{rad}}$ required so that the peak target heat flux does not exceed the material limit $q_{\\text{lim}}$. Take $q_{\\text{lim}} = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ to reflect non-carbon wall constraints. Then evaluate $f_{\\text{rad}}$ numerically for the given parameters.\n\nExpress your final answer for $f_{\\text{rad}}$ as a decimal number with no units, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided data and constraints are consistent and realistic for the field of nuclear fusion energy research, specifically concerning power exhaust in a tokamak divertor. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimum required radiated power fraction, $f_{\\text{rad}}$, needed to keep the peak divertor target heat flux, $q_{t}$, below a specified material limit, $q_{\\text{lim}}$. The solution is derived by applying the principle of energy conservation to the power flow from the core plasma to the divertor targets.\n\nFirst, we define the total power crossing the separatrix into the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL), given as $P_{\\text{sep}}$.\nA fraction $f_{\\text{rad}}$ of this power is radiated volumetrically, primarily by seeded impurities, before it can reach the material surfaces of the divertor. The power that is not radiated and continues to flow towards the divertor targets is therefore:\n$$P_{\\text{target, total}} = P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})$$\n\nThe problem specifies that a fraction $\\phi$ of this non-radiated power strikes the outer divertor target. The power incident on the outer target, $P_{\\text{out}}$, is thus:\n$$P_{\\text{out}} = \\phi P_{\\text{target, total}} = \\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})$$\n\nThe outer divertor has a wetted area $S_{\\text{out}}$ over which this power is distributed. The area-averaged heat flux on the outer target, $\\overline{q}_{t}$, is the power to the outer target divided by its area:\n$$\\overline{q}_{t} = \\frac{P_{\\text{out}}}{S_{\\text{out}}} = \\frac{\\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})}{S_{\\text{out}}}$$\n\nDue to various physical and geometric effects, the heat flux is not uniform across the wetted area. A peaking factor, $p$, is introduced to relate the peak heat flux, $q_{t}$, to the average heat flux, $\\overline{q}_{t}$. The definition is given as $q_{t} = p \\overline{q}_{t}$. Substituting the expression for $\\overline{q}_{t}$, we get the peak heat flux on the outer target:\n$$q_{t} = p \\left( \\frac{\\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})}{S_{\\text{out}}} \\right)$$\n\nThe engineering constraint is that this peak heat flux must not exceed the material thermal limit, $q_{\\text{lim}}$. This establishes the following inequality:\n$$q_{t} \\le q_{\\text{lim}}$$\n$$p \\frac{\\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})}{S_{\\text{out}}} \\le q_{\\text{lim}}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the *minimum* required radiated fraction $f_{\\text{rad}}$ that satisfies this condition. The minimum value of $f_{\\text{rad}}$ corresponds to the case where the peak heat flux is exactly equal to the limit. Therefore, we solve the equality:\n$$p \\frac{\\phi P_{\\text{sep}} (1 - f_{\\text{rad}})}{S_{\\text{out}}} = q_{\\text{lim}}$$\n\nOur goal is to isolate $f_{\\text{rad}}$. We can rearrange the equation algebraically. First, we solve for the term $(1 - f_{\\text{rad}})$:\n$$1 - f_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{q_{\\text{lim}} S_{\\text{out}}}{p \\phi P_{\\text{sep}}}$$\nFinally, we solve for $f_{\\text{rad}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} = 1 - \\frac{q_{\\text{lim}} S_{\\text{out}}}{p \\phi P_{\\text{sep}}}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the minimum radiated fraction.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to evaluate $f_{\\text{rad}}$:\n- Power crossing the separatrix, $P_{\\text{sep}} = 150 \\ \\mathrm{MW}$\n- Fraction of non-radiated power to the outer target, $\\phi = 0.70$\n- Outer divertor wetted area, $S_{\\text{out}} = 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- Heat flux peaking factor, $p = 1.50$\n- Peak heat flux limit, $q_{\\text{lim}} = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} = 1 - \\frac{(5.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}) (6.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2})}{(1.50) (0.70) (150 \\ \\mathrm{MW})}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and denominator of the fraction.\nNumerator:\n$$q_{\\text{lim}} S_{\\text{out}} = 5.0 \\times 6.0 = 30.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\nDenominator:\n$$p \\phi P_{\\text{sep}} = 1.50 \\times 0.70 \\times 150 = 1.05 \\times 150 = 157.5 \\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{MW}$ cancel, as expected, leaving a dimensionless fraction.\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} = 1 - \\frac{30.0}{157.5}$$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{30.0}{157.5} \\approx 0.19047619...$$\nFinally, we compute $f_{\\text{rad}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} = 1 - 0.19047619... = 0.8095238...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f_{\\text{rad}} \\approx 0.8095$$\nThis means that a minimum of approximately $80.95\\%$ of the power crossing the separatrix must be radiated to keep the peak target heat flux at the acceptable limit of $5.0 \\ \\mathrm{MW} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.",

For example, a $10\\%$ uncertainty in $T_{e}$ would lead to approximately a $3\\%$ uncertainty in the calculated $n_{Z}$ required to achieve the target radiated power. The positive sign of $s$ indicates that if $T_{e}$ is overestimated, the required $n_{Z}$ will also be overestimated, and vice versa.",
