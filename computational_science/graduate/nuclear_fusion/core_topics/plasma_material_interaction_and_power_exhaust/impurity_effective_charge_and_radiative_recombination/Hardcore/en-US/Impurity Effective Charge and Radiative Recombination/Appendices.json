            "solution": "The problem has been validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard definitions and concepts in plasma physics concerning impurity ions. The provided data and constraints are self-contained and consistent, leading to a solvable problem.\n\n**Part (a): Derivation of Mean Charge and Effective Charge**\n\nThe mean charge of the impurity species, denoted by $\\langle Z \\rangle$, is the average charge state over the entire population of impurity ions. It is formally defined as the first moment of the charge-state distribution $\\{f_q\\}$. Given that $f_q$ is the fraction of ions in charge state $q$, the mean charge is:\n$$\n\\langle Z \\rangle \\equiv \\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q f_q\n$$\nThis definition is consistent with the fundamental definition of an average. We can also derive it from the given number densities. The total number of elementary charges contributed by the impurity ions is equal to the electron density they provide, $n_{e,Z} = \\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q n_q$. The total number of impurity ions is $n_Z = \\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} n_q$. The average charge per ion is therefore:\n$$\n\\langle Z \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q n_q}{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} n_q} = \\frac{n_{e,Z}}{n_Z}\n$$\nBy substituting the definition $f_q = n_q / n_Z$, we recover the first expression:\n$$\n\\langle Z \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q (f_q n_Z)}{n_Z} = \\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q f_q\n$$\n\nThe species-specific effective charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is a quantity used to characterize the impurity's contribution to plasma processes that depend on the square of the ionic charge, such as bremsstrahlung radiation and radiative recombination in the coronal limit. The power radiated from ions of charge $q$ is proportional to $n_e n_q q^2$. The total power from the impurity species is therefore proportional to $n_e \\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} n_q q^2$.\n\nThe species-specific $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined such that this total contribution to radiation can be expressed as a product of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the electron density from the species ($n_{e,Z}$), and the total species density ($n_Z$), or more commonly, as the product of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and the total charge density from the species ($e n_{e,Z}$) in relevant formulas. The standard definition that achieves this relates the second moment of the charge distribution to the first. Specifically, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined as the ratio of the \"charge-squared-weighted density\" to the \"charge-weighted density\". The charge-weighted density is simply the electron density from the species, $n_{e,Z}$.\nThus, the definition is:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q^2 n_q}{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q n_q}\n$$\nThe denominator, $\\sum q n_q$, is the electron density $n_{e,Z}$ contributed by the impurity species. This explicitly shows how the \"electron density weighting\" enters the definition of $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nTo express this in terms of the charge-state fractions $\\{f_q\\}$, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the total impurity density $n_Z$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q^2 (n_q/n_Z)}{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q (n_q/n_Z)} = \\frac{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q^2 f_q}{\\sum_{q=0}^{Z_{\\mathrm{nuc}}} q f_q}\n$$\nRecognizing the numerator as the mean-square charge, $\\langle Z^2 \\rangle \\equiv \\sum q^2 f_q$, and the denominator as the mean charge, $\\langle Z \\rangle$, we can write:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\langle Z^2 \\rangle}{\\langle Z \\rangle}\n$$\n\n**Part (b): Construction of the Discrete Distribution**\n\nWe are given a distribution with nonzero fractions only for charge states $q=0$, $q=4$, and $q=12$. Let these fractions be $f_0$, $f_4$, and $f_{12}$. We have three constraints to determine these three unknowns.\n\n1.  **Normalization of fractions:** The sum of all fractions must be $1$.\n    $$ f_0 + f_4 + f_{12} = 1 \\quad (1) $$\n\n2.  **Mean charge:** The mean charge $\\langle Z \\rangle$ is given as $4$.\n    $$ \\langle Z \\rangle = \\sum_q q f_q = (0 \\cdot f_0) + (4 \\cdot f_4) + (12 \\cdot f_{12}) = 4 $$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$ 4f_4 + 12f_{12} = 4 $$\n    Dividing by $4$:\n    $$ f_4 + 3f_{12} = 1 \\quad (2) $$\n\n3.  **Effective charge:** The effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is given as $10$. Using the formula from Part (a):\n    $$ Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\langle Z^2 \\rangle}{\\langle Z \\rangle} = 10 $$\n    We know $\\langle Z \\rangle = 4$, so the mean-square charge $\\langle Z^2 \\rangle$ must be:\n    $$ \\langle Z^2 \\rangle = Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot \\langle Z \\rangle = 10 \\cdot 4 = 40 $$\n    We now write out the expression for $\\langle Z^2 \\rangle$:\n    $$ \\langle Z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_q q^2 f_q = (0^2 \\cdot f_0) + (4^2 \\cdot f_4) + (12^2 \\cdot f_{12}) = 40 $$\n    $$ 16f_4 + 144f_{12} = 40 $$\n    Dividing by $8$ simplifies the equation to:\n    $$ 2f_4 + 18f_{12} = 5 \\quad (3) $$\n\nWe now have a system of three linear equations for the three unknowns $f_0$, $f_4$, and $f_{12}$. We can solve equations $(2)$ and $(3)$ for $f_4$ and $f_{12}$. From equation $(2)$, we express $f_4$ in terms of $f_{12}$:\n$$ f_4 = 1 - 3f_{12} $$\nSubstitute this expression for $f_4$ into equation $(3)$:\n$$ 2(1 - 3f_{12}) + 18f_{12} = 5 $$\n$$ 2 - 6f_{12} + 18f_{12} = 5 $$\n$$ 12f_{12} = 3 $$\n$$ f_{12} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nNow, we can find $f_4$ using the expression derived from equation $(2)$:\n$$ f_4 = 1 - 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nFinally, we use equation $(1)$ to find $f_0$:\n$$ f_0 = 1 - f_4 - f_{12} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = 1 - \\frac{2}{4} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe resulting distribution is $(f_0, f_4, f_{12}) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4})$. These values are non-negative and sum to $1$, satisfying the properties of a probability distribution.\nThe solution provides the exact rational values as requested.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in plasma physics. All required data are provided, the premises are physically realistic for a magnetically confined fusion plasma, and the objectives are clearly defined.\n\nThe core of the problem is to derive the characteristic timescales for changes in the impurity charge-state distribution and, consequently, in the effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. We are considering a simplified scenario where the dynamics are dominated by a single pair of adjacent charge states, with charge numbers $q$ and $q+1$ for a given impurity species. The total number density of this impurity species is $n_z = n_q + n_{q+1}$, where $n_q$ and $n_{q+1}$ are the number densities of the respective charge states.\n\nIn the absence of particle transport, the time evolution of these densities is governed by the collisional-radiative rate equations for electron-impact ionization and radiative recombination:\n$$ \\frac{dn_q}{dt} = -n_e n_q S_q + n_e n_{q+1} \\alpha_{q+1} $$\n$$ \\frac{dn_{q+1}}{dt} = +n_e n_q S_q - n_e n_{q+1} \\alpha_{q+1} $$\nHere, $n_e$ is the electron density, $S_q$ is the ionization rate coefficient from state $q$ to $q+1$, and $\\alpha_{q+1}$ is the radiative recombination rate coefficient from state $q+1$ to $q$. Note that adding these two equations gives $\\frac{d}{dt}(n_q + n_{q+1}) = 0$, which means the total impurity density $n_z$ is constant under these local atomic processes.\n\nThe problem asks for two characteristic timescales under specific limiting conditions.\nFirst, we consider the rise time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}$. This corresponds to a scenario where the effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is increasing, which means the impurity population is shifting towards the higher charge state, $q+1$. This shift is driven by electron-impact ionization. The problem asks for the timescale when ionization is the \"leading process\". This implies we consider the characteristic rate of the ionization process itself. The rate at which ions of charge $q$ are ionized to charge $q+1$ is $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ion}} = n_e S_q$. The characteristic timescale is the inverse of this rate.\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}} = \\frac{1}{n_e S_q} $$\nSecond, we consider the decay time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}}$. This corresponds to a scenario where $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is decreasing, driven by a shift in population towards the lower charge state, $q$. This shift is governed by radiative recombination. When recombination is the \"leading process\", its characteristic rate determines the timescale. The rate at which ions of charge $q+1$ recombine to charge $q$ is $\\nu_{\\mathrm{rec}} = n_e \\alpha_{q+1}$. The characteristic timescale for this process is its inverse.\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}} = \\frac{1}{n_e \\alpha_{q+1}} $$\nNext, we must calculate the numerical values for these timescales and compare them to the perpendicular particle transport timescale, $\\tau_p$, defined as $\\tau_p = a^2/D_z$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Electron density $n_{e} = 5.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Ionization rate coefficient $S_{q} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Recombination rate coefficient $\\alpha_{q+1} = 7.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Minor radius $a = 0.45\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Impurity diffusion coefficient $D_{z} = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the transport timescale $\\tau_p$:\n$$ \\tau_p = \\frac{a^2}{D_z} = \\frac{(0.45\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{0.60\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.2025\\ \\mathrm{m}^2}{0.60\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.3375\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nNow, we calculate the ionization rate $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ and the rise time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}$:\n$$ \\nu_{\\mathrm{ion}} = n_e S_q = (5.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (1.6 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 8.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}} = \\frac{1}{8.0 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nNext, we calculate the recombination rate $\\nu_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ and the decay time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}}$:\n$$ \\nu_{\\mathrm{rec}} = n_e \\alpha_{q+1} = (5.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (7.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 3.5 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}} = \\frac{1}{3.5 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx 2.85714 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}} \\approx 2.86 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the required dimensionless ratios.\nRatio for the rise time:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}}{\\tau_p} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}}{0.3375\\ \\mathrm{s}} \\approx 3.70370 \\times 10^{-7} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}}{\\tau_p} \\approx 3.70 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n\nRatio for the decay time:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}}}{\\tau_p} = \\frac{2.85714 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}}{0.3375\\ \\mathrm{s}} \\approx 8.4651 \\times 10^{-7} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}}}{\\tau_p} \\approx 8.47 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n\nThe four requested values, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}} = 2.86 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{rise}}/\\tau_p = 3.70 \\times 10^{-7}$\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{decay}}/\\tau_p = 8.47 \\times 10^{-7}$\nThese results indicate that the atomic processes of ionization and recombination occur on a much faster timescale (sub-microsecond) than the cross-field particle transport (hundreds of milliseconds). This is a common feature in hot, dense fusion plasmas, implying that the impurity charge-state distribution is often close to a local collisional-radiative equilibrium determined by $n_e$ and $T_e$, rather than being dominated by transport effects.",
