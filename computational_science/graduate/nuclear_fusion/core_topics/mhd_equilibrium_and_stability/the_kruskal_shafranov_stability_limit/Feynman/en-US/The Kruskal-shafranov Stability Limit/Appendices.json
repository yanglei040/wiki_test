The magnetic field component generated by the axial current $J_z$ will be purely poloidal, $\\mathbf{B}_{\\theta}(r) = B_{\\theta}(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}}$. The left-hand side of Ampère's law becomes:\n$$ \\oint_C \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} B_{\\theta}(r) (r d\\theta) = 2\\pi r B_{\\theta}(r) $$\nThe uniform axial field $B_z$ is perpendicular to the integration path $d\\mathbf{l}$ and thus does not contribute to the line integral.\n\nThe enclosed current $I_{\\text{enc}}$ is found by integrating the axial current density $J_z(r')$ over the area of the circular loop of radius $r$:\n$$ I_{\\text{enc}}(r) = \\int_{A} J_z(r') dA = \\int_0^r J_z(r') (2\\pi r' dr') $$\nThe problem provides the current density profile:\n$$ J_{z}(r') = J_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{r'^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $I_{\\text{enc}}(r)$:\n$$ I_{\\text{enc}}(r) = \\int_0^r J_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{r'^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right) 2\\pi r' dr' = 2\\pi J_0 \\int_0^r \\left(r' - \\frac{r'^3}{a^2}\\right) dr' $$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$ I_{\\text{enc}}(r) = 2\\pi J_0 \\left[ \\frac{r'^2}{2} - \\frac{r'^4}{4a^2} \\right]_0^r = 2\\pi J_0 \\left( \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4a^2} \\right) $$\nNow, we equate the two sides of Ampère's law:\n$$ 2\\pi r B_{\\theta}(r) = \\mu_0 \\left[ 2\\pi J_0 \\left( \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4a^2} \\right) \\right] $$\nSolving for $B_{\\theta}(r)$ gives the poloidal magnetic field inside the plasma:\n$$ B_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 J_0}{r} \\left( \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4a^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu_0 J_0 r}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{2a^2} \\right) $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the safety factor $q(r)$**\n\nThe safety factor $q(r)$ in the large-aspect-ratio, straight-cylinder approximation is defined as the ratio of the number of toroidal to the number of poloidal transits a magnetic field line makes.

Assessment of MHD Stability Implications**\n\nThe Kruskal-Shafranov stability limit concerns the stability of a tokamak plasma against large-scale, current-driven ideal MHD instabilities known as external kink modes. The stability condition for a mode with poloidal and toroidal mode numbers $(m, n)$ is that the safety factor at the plasma edge, $q(a)$, must satisfy $q(a) > m/n$. The most restrictive of these is for the $m/n=1/1$ mode, leading to the fundamental requirement $q(a)>1$. In general, higher $q(a)$ values are more stable against external kinks.\n\nOur derivation shows that $q_h(a)/q_p(a) = 1$, which means the edge safety factor is identical for both the peaked and hollow profiles when the total plasma current $I_p$ is the same. Since the Kruskal-Shafranov limit is a condition on $q(a)$, replacing the peaked profile with the hollow profile (while keeping $I_p$ constant) has **no effect on the stability boundary for ideal external kink modes**. The maximum plasma current that can be stably confined, as determined by this limit, remains unchanged.\n\nHowever, the internal stability characteristics are significantly different. The on-axis safety factor for the hollow profile, $q_h(0)$, is a factor of $(1+3\\varepsilon)/(3\\varepsilon)$ larger than for the peaked profile, $q_p(0)$. Since $0  \\varepsilon  1$, this factor is always greater than $4/3$ (at $\\varepsilon=1$) and goes to infinity as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. A high value of $q(0)$ is strongly stabilizing for the internal $m=1$ kink mode, which requires $q(0)  1$ to be unstable. Therefore, the hollow profile is much more robust against this internal instability. This change in the $q$ profile and its shear, $s=(r/q)(dq/dr)$, has profound implications for other MHD modes (like tearing modes) and transport, but with respect to the specific question about the Kruskal-Shafranov limit, there is no change.",

Thus, the general form of the vacuum scalar potential is:\n$$ \\Phi(r, \\theta, z) = \\left( C_1 I_m\\big(\\frac{n r}{R_0}\\big) + C_2 K_m\\big(\\frac{n r}{R_0}\\big) \\right) \\cos\\left(m\\theta - \\frac{n z}{R_0}\\right) $$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nNext, we identify and apply the boundary conditions. There are two conditions on the perturbed vacuum magnetic field.\nThe first condition is at the perfectly conducting wall at $r=b$, where the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish. The radial component of the perturbed vacuum field is $B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r} = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}$. The boundary condition is:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r}(b, \\theta, z) = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{r=b} = 0 $$\nThe second condition is at the plasma-vacuum interface at $r=a$. In ideal MHD, the plasma boundary is a magnetic flux surface. The linearized condition states that the normal component of the magnetic field at the displaced surface is zero. This relates the radial component of the perturbed vacuum magnetic field at the unperturbed surface to the plasma displacement:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r}(a, \\theta, z) = \\mathbf{B}_0(a) \\cdot \\nabla \\xi_r $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}_0(a) = B_{\\theta}(a)\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} + B_{z}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is the equilibrium magnetic field at the plasma edge. Let's evaluate the right-hand side:\n$$ \\mathbf{B}_0(a) \\cdot \\nabla \\xi_r = \\left( \\frac{B_{\\theta}(a)}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} + B_z\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\right) \\xi_r \\bigg|_{r=a} $$\nWith $\\xi_r = \\xi_0 \\cos(m\\theta - kz)$, this becomes:\n$$ \\mathbf{B}_0(a) \\cdot \\nabla \\xi_r = \\frac{B_{\\theta}(a)}{a} (-m\\xi_0 \\sin(m\\theta - kz)) + B_z (k\\xi_0 \\sin(m\\theta - kz)) $$\n$$ = \\left( k B_z - \\frac{m}{a}B_{\\theta}(a) \\right) \\xi_0 \\sin(m\\theta - kz) $$\nThe radial field from the potential is:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r} = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r} = -k \\left( C_1 I'_m(kr) + C_2 K'_m(kr) \\right) \\cos(m\\theta - kz) $$\nA phase shift can be introduced in the definition of $\\Phi$ to match the $\\sin$ dependence. Alternatively, using complex notation $\\xi_r = \\xi_0 \\exp(i(m\\theta-kz))$ and $\\Phi = \\hat{\\Phi}(r) \\exp(i(m\\theta-kz))$, the condition is $-\\hat{\\Phi}'(a) = i(m B_{\\theta}(a)/a - k B_z)\\xi_0$. The core of the physics remains the same. Let's choose $\\Phi(r, \\theta, z) = \\hat{\\Phi}(r)\\sin(m\\theta-kz)$, then $B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r} = -\\hat{\\Phi}'(r)\\sin(m\\theta-kz)$. The condition at $r=a$ becomes:\n$$ -\\hat{\\Phi}'(a) = \\left(k B_z - \\frac{m}{a}B_{\\theta}(a)\\right) \\xi_0 $$\nThe wall condition is $-\\hat{\\Phi}'(b)=0$.\n\nThe crucial step is to analyze these conditions in the thin-gap limit, $b \\to a^+$. As the conducting wall approaches the plasma surface, the boundary condition at the wall, $B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r}(b) = 0$, implies that the radial perturbed field must vanish on a surface infinitesimally close to $r=a$. By continuity of the field, this forces the radial field to be zero at the plasma surface itself:\n$$ \\lim_{b \\to a^+} B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r}(b) = B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r}(a) = 0 $$\nThis provides the marginal condition sought. Applying this to the ideal MHD interface condition:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{vac},1,r}(a, \\theta, z) = \\left( k B_z - \\frac{m}{a}B_{\\theta}(a) \\right) \\xi_0 \\sin(m\\theta - kz) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial displacement, we must have $\\xi_0 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the marginal stability condition is that the coefficient of the displacement term vanishes:\n$$ k B_z - \\frac{m}{a}B_{\\theta}(a) = 0 $$\nThis condition signifies that the helical pitch of the perturbation, defined by the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp} = (m/a)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} - k\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, is aligned with the equilibrium magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0(a)$ at the plasma edge, i.e., $\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_0(a) = 0$. Such \"flute-like\" perturbations do not bend magnetic field lines and are thus marginally stable in ideal MHD when the external kink drive is suppressed by a wall at the plasma surface.\n\nFinally, we express this marginal condition in terms of the edge safety factor $q(a)$. The safety factor is defined as $q(r) = \\frac{r B_z}{R_0 B_{\\theta}(r)}$, and we have $k=n/R_0$. Substituting these into the marginal condition:\n$$ \\frac{n}{R_0} B_z = \\frac{m}{a} B_{\\theta}(a) $$\nTo find an expression for $q(a)$, we rearrange this equation to match the definition of $q(a)$:\n$$ \\frac{a B_z}{R_0 B_{\\theta}(a)} = \\frac{m}{n} $$\nThus, the marginal edge safety factor is given by the ratio of the poloidal and axial mode numbers.\n$$ q(a) = \\frac{m}{n} $$\nThis is the renowned Kruskal-Shafranov stability limit for external kink modes, derived here in the specific case where a conducting wall is located at the plasma surface, which makes the resonant condition the marginal stability point.",
