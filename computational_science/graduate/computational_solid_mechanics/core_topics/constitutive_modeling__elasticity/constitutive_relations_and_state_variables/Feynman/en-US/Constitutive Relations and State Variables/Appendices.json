            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and hyperelasticity, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. There are no scientific or factual unsoundnesses, missing data, or ambiguities. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in deriving constitutive relations from a given stored-energy function.\n\nThe objective is to derive the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, $S$, for a compressible Neo-Hookean material and express it in its spectral form. The derivation begins with the fundamental definition of $S$ in hyperelasticity, which relates the stress to the gradient of the stored-energy function, $W$, with respect to the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, $C$. The definition is:\n$$\nS = 2 \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial C}\n$$\nThe given stored-energy function is:\n$$\nW(C) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\left(\\mathrm{tr}(C)-3\\right) - \\mu\\,\\ln J + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(\\ln J\\right)^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ and $\\kappa$ are material constants, $\\mathrm{tr}(C)$ is the trace of $C$, and $J=\\det(F)$ is the determinant of the deformation gradient $F$. We can relate $J$ to $C$ via the identity $J^2 = \\det(C)$, which implies $J = \\sqrt{\\det(C)}$ since $J>0$.\n\nTo compute the derivative of $W$ with respect to $C$, we differentiate each term separately.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial C} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C}\\left[\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\left(\\mathrm{tr}(C)-3\\right)\\right] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C}\\left[-\\mu\\,\\ln J\\right] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C}\\left[\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(\\ln J\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\nLet's evaluate each term.\n\nFor the first term, we use the standard result from tensor calculus for the derivative of the trace: $\\frac{\\partial(\\mathrm{tr}(C))}{\\partial C} = I$, where $I$ is the second-order identity tensor. The derivative of the constant $-3$ is the zero tensor.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C}\\left[\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\left(\\mathrm{tr}(C)-3\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\frac{\\partial(\\mathrm{tr}(C))}{\\partial C} = \\frac{\\mu}{2} I\n$$\nFor the second and third terms, which are functions of $J$, we apply the chain rule. For a scalar function $\\phi(J(C))$, the derivative is $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial C} = \\frac{d\\phi}{dJ} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C}$. We first need to compute the derivative $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C}$. Using the relation $J = (\\det C)^{1/2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C} = \\frac{\\partial ((\\det C)^{1/2})}{\\partial C}\n$$\nApplying the chain rule and Jacobi's formula, $\\frac{\\partial(\\det C)}{\\partial C} = (\\det C) C^{-T}$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\det C)^{-1/2} \\frac{\\partial(\\det C)}{\\partial C} = \\frac{1}{2} J^{-1} (J^2 C^{-T})\n$$\nSince $C=F^T F$ is a symmetric tensor, its inverse $C^{-1}$ is also symmetric, so $C^{-T} = C^{-1}$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C} = \\frac{1}{2} J C^{-1}\n$$\nNow we can compute the derivatives of the remaining terms of $W$. For the second term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C}\\left[-\\mu\\,\\ln J\\right] = -\\mu \\frac{d(\\ln J)}{dJ} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C} = -\\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{J}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} J C^{-1}\\right) = -\\frac{\\mu}{2} C^{-1}\n$$\nFor the third term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C}\\left[\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(\\ln J\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\cdot \\left(2 \\ln J\\right) \\frac{d(\\ln J)}{dJ} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C} = \\kappa (\\ln J) \\left(\\frac{1}{J}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} J C^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\ln J) C^{-1}\n$$\nCombining all three parts, we obtain the total derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial C} = \\frac{\\mu}{2} I - \\frac{\\mu}{2} C^{-1} + \\frac{\\kappa \\ln J}{2} C^{-1} = \\frac{\\mu}{2} I + \\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa \\ln J - \\mu) C^{-1}\n$$\nThe second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor $S$ is then:\n$$\nS = 2 \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial C} = 2 \\left[ \\frac{\\mu}{2} I + \\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa \\ln J - \\mu) C^{-1} \\right] = \\mu I + (\\kappa \\ln J - \\mu) C^{-1}\n$$\nThe next step is to express this result in the spectral basis $\\{N_i \\otimes N_i\\}$. We are given the spectral decomposition of $C$:\n$$\nC = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\lambda_{i}^{2}\\,N_{i}\\otimes N_{i}\n$$\nwhere $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$ are the principal stretches and $\\{N_i\\}$ is an orthonormal set of eigenvectors. The identity tensor $I$ and the inverse tensor $C^{-1}$ can also be expressed in this basis. The identity tensor is:\n$$\nI = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i \\otimes N_i\n$$\nThe inverse tensor $C^{-1}$ is obtained by taking the inverse of the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i^2$:\n$$\nC^{-1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\lambda_i^2)^{-1} N_i \\otimes N_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i^2} N_i \\otimes N_i\n$$\nWe are also given that $J = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3$. Substituting these spectral forms into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\mu \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i \\otimes N_i\\right) + (\\kappa \\ln(\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3) - \\mu) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i^2} N_i \\otimes N_i \\right)\n$$\nWe can combine these sums into a single summation over the index $i$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left[ \\mu \\cdot 1 + (\\kappa \\ln(\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3) - \\mu) \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i^2} \\right] N_i \\otimes N_i\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final spectral expression for the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\mu + \\frac{\\kappa \\ln(\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3) - \\mu}{\\lambda_i^2} \\right) N_i \\otimes N_i\n$$\nThis expression provides the components of $S$ along the principal strain directions. The coefficients depend only on the material parameters $\\mu$, $\\kappa$, and the principal stretches $\\lambda_i$, as required.\n\nRegarding the treatment of eigenvalue multiplicity, the given stored-energy function depends on $\\mathrm{tr}(C)$ and $\\det(C)$, which are the first and third principal invariants of $C$. A material whose stored-energy function depends only on the invariants of $C$ is, by definition, isotropic. This means its mechanical response is independent of the orientation of the material. For such materials, the stress tensor $S$ is always coaxial with the strain tensor $C$, meaning they share the same principal directions (eigenspaces).\n\nIf the eigenvalues of $C$ are distinct (e.g., $\\lambda_1^2 \\neq \\lambda_2^2 \\neq \\lambda_3^2$), the corresponding eigenvectors $\\{N_i\\}$ are unique (up to sign), and the spectral representation of $S$ is uniquely defined.\n\nIf there is eigenvalue multiplicity, for instance $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2$, the corresponding eigenspace for the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1^2$ is a $2$-dimensional plane. Any orthonormal basis $\\{N_1, N_2\\}$ spanning this plane is a valid choice of eigenvectors, so the individual vectors $N_1$ and $N_2$ are not unique. However, because the material is isotropic, the stress response must be unique and well-defined. This is resolved because the coefficients in the spectral sum for $S$ depend only on the eigenvalues. If $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2$, then the corresponding coefficients in the sum for $S$ are also equal:\n$$\ns_1 = \\mu + \\frac{\\kappa \\ln J - \\mu}{\\lambda_1^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_2 = \\mu + \\frac{\\kappa \\ln J - \\mu}{\\lambda_2^2} \\implies s_1=s_2\n$$\nThe part of the stress tensor corresponding to the degenerate eigenspace is $s_1 N_1 \\otimes N_1 + s_2 N_2 \\otimes N_2 = s_1 (N_1 \\otimes N_1 + N_2 \\otimes N_2)$. The operator $P = N_1 \\otimes N_1 + N_2 \\otimes N_2$ is the spectral projector onto the degenerate eigenspace. This projector is unique and independent of the specific choice of basis $\\{N_1, N_2\\}$ within that eigenspace. Thus, the stress tensor $S$ remains uniquely defined even when the individual eigenvectors are not.\n\nIn an anisotropic material, the stored-energy function $W$ would depend explicitly on preferred material directions, represented by structural tensors. In this case, $W$ is not generally a symmetric function of the principal stretches, and the stress tensor $S$ is not generally coaxial with $C$. If $C$ were to have a degenerate eigenspace, the corresponding stress components would not necessarily be equal. The simple spectral expansion used above would be invalid, and the determination of $S$ would require a more general Gâteaux derivative framework, yielding a stress tensor whose principal directions differ from those of $C$. The uniqueness of $S$ is preserved, but its structure is more complex and not simply aligned with the principal strains.",

For an incompressible neo-Hookean material with strain-energy density $W = \\frac{\\mu}{2}(I_1-3)$, the Cauchy stress is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\mu\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is a hydrostatic pressure and $\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{F}^{\\top}$ is the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor.

The shear stress is then simply:\n$$\n\\sigma_{12}(\\gamma) = \\mu\\gamma\n$$\nIn this model, the shear stress increases linearly with shear strain and does not exhibit any oscillation.\n\nThe hyperelastic formulation avoids the unphysical oscillations seen in the hypoelastic model because it is an integrable, path-independent model. The stress is a state function of the finite deformation (represented by $\\mathbf{F}$ or $\\mathbf{B}$). In contrast, the hypoelastic model defines the stress through a rate equation. The integration of this rate equation is path-dependent. The Jaumann objective rate, while ensuring frame-indifference, correlates the stress rate with the spin of the material. In continuous simple shear, this spin coupling leads to an artificial rotation of the stress tensor relative to the laboratory axes, causing the predicted stress components to oscillate. The hyperelastic model avoids this artifact because its formulation is based on a scalar energy potential, which guarantees a unique stress state for any given deformation state, irrespective of the path taken to reach it.",

            "solution": "The solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement: a theoretical derivation (Task A) and a computational implementation (Task B).\n\n### Task A: Derivation of the Discrete Energy-Dissipation Inequality and Stability Conditions\n\nThe objective is to derive a discrete form of the second law of thermodynamics for the given material model and time-stepping scheme. We aim to establish sufficient conditions on the Helmholtz free energy $\\,\\psi(\\varepsilon,\\alpha)\\,$ such that the discrete dissipation $\\,\\Delta D\\,$ is always non-negative.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics, in the form of the Clausius-Duhem inequality for isothermal processes, states that the rate of intrinsic dissipation must be non-negative. The dissipation rate per unit volume is given by $\\,D = \\sigma\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\dot{\\psi} \\ge 0\\,$. Using the chain rule for $\\,\\dot{\\psi}\\,$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\psi} = \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\varepsilon}\\dot{\\varepsilon} + \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\alpha}\\dot{\\alpha}\n$$\nBy substituting the thermodynamic definitions of stress, $\\,\\sigma = \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\psi\\,$, and the conjugate force, $\\,Y = -\\partial_{\\alpha}\\psi\\,$, we get:\n$$\n\\dot{\\psi} = \\sigma\\dot{\\varepsilon} - Y\\dot{\\alpha}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Clausius-Duhem inequality yields the standard expression for the dissipation rate in terms of the internal variables:\n$$\nD = \\sigma\\dot{\\varepsilon} - (\\sigma\\dot{\\varepsilon} - Y\\dot{\\alpha}) = Y\\dot{\\alpha} \\ge 0\n$$\nTo obtain a discrete counterpart required for analyzing the numerical scheme, we do not integrate this rate inequality. Instead, we use a global argument over the time step $\\,\\Delta t = t_{n+1} - t_n\\,$. The core of the derivation relies on the convexity properties of the energy and dissipation functions.\n\nLet us start by analyzing the definition of discrete dissipation, $\\,\\Delta D = W_{\\mathrm{ext}} - \\Delta\\psi\\,$, which is $\\,\\Delta D = \\sigma_{n+1}\\Delta\\varepsilon - (\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n)\\,$.\nHere, quantities with subscript $\\,n\\,$ are evaluated at $\\,(\\varepsilon_n, \\alpha_n)\\,$ and those with subscript $\\,n+1\\,$ are at $\\,(\\varepsilon_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})\\,$.\n\nThe key step is to assume that the Helmholtz free energy $\\,\\psi(\\varepsilon, \\alpha)\\,$ is a **convex function** of the state variables $\\,(\\varepsilon, \\alpha)\\,$. For any twice-differentiable convex function $\\,f(\\mathbf{x})\\,$, the following inequality holds:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x}_a) \\ge f(\\mathbf{x}_b) + \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_b) \\cdot (\\mathbf{x}_a - \\mathbf{x}_b)\n$$\nApplying this property to $\\,\\psi(\\varepsilon, \\alpha)\\,$ with $\\,\\mathbf{x}_a = (\\varepsilon_n, \\alpha_n)\\,$ and $\\,\\mathbf{x}_b = (\\varepsilon_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})\\,$ gives:\n$$\n\\psi(\\varepsilon_n, \\alpha_n) \\ge \\psi(\\varepsilon_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1}) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\varepsilon}\\right|_{n+1}(\\varepsilon_n - \\varepsilon_{n+1}) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\alpha}\\right|_{n+1}(\\alpha_n - \\alpha_{n+1})\n$$\nUsing the thermodynamic definitions $\\,\\sigma_{n+1} = \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\psi|_{n+1}\\,$ and $\\,Y_{n+1} = -\\partial_{\\alpha}\\psi|_{n+1}\\,$, and the increments $\\,\\Delta\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon_n\\,$ and $\\,\\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_{n+1} - \\alpha_n\\,$, the inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\psi_n \\ge \\psi_{n+1} + \\sigma_{n+1}(-\\Delta\\varepsilon) - Y_{n+1}(-\\Delta\\alpha)\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_n \\ge \\psi_{n+1} - \\sigma_{n+1}\\Delta\\varepsilon + Y_{n+1}\\Delta\\alpha\n$$\nRearranging this expression to match the form of the discrete dissipation $\\,\\Delta D\\,$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{n+1}\\Delta\\varepsilon - (\\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n) \\ge Y_{n+1}\\Delta\\alpha\n$$\nThis directly yields the discrete dissipation inequality:\n$$\n\\Delta D \\ge Y_{n+1}\\Delta\\alpha\n$$\nNow we must analyze the term on the right-hand side, $\\,Y_{n+1}\\Delta\\alpha\\,$. The backward Euler (BE) time discretization of the evolution law $\\,Y = \\partial\\Phi(v)\\,$ where $\\,v=\\dot{\\alpha}\\,$ is:\n$$\nY_{n+1} = \\partial\\Phi(v_{n+1}) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad v_{n+1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\alpha}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the right-hand side of our inequality:\n$$\nY_{n+1}\\Delta\\alpha = \\partial\\Phi(v_{n+1}) \\cdot (\\Delta t \\, v_{n+1}) = \\Delta t \\, v_{n+1}\\partial\\Phi(v_{n+1})\n$$\nThe dissipation potential $\\,\\Phi(v)\\,$ is given as a non-negative, convex function. For any differentiable convex function $\\,g(x)\\,$, the inequality $\\,g(x) - g(y) \\ge g'(y)(x-y)\\,$ holds. Let us choose $\\,g(v) = \\Phi(v)\\,$, $\\,v=0\\,$, and $\\,y=v_{n+1}\\,$. This yields:\n$$\n\\Phi(0) - \\Phi(v_{n+1}) \\ge \\partial\\Phi(v_{n+1})(0 - v_{n+1}) = -v_{n+1}\\partial\\Phi(v_{n+1})\n$$\nFor a dissipation potential, it is standard to assume $\\,\\Phi(0) = 0\\,$, which is consistent with the given form $\\,\\Phi(v)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\eta v^2\\,$. The inequality thus simplifies to $\\,-\\Phi(v_{n+1}) \\ge -v_{n+1}\\partial\\Phi(v_{n+1})\\,$, or:\n$$\nv_{n+1}\\partial\\Phi(v_{n+1}) \\ge \\Phi(v_{n+1})\n$$\nSince $\\,\\Phi\\,$ is also non-negative, we have $\\,\\Phi(v_{n+1}) \\ge 0\\,$. Combining these results:\n$$\nY_{n+1}\\Delta\\alpha = \\Delta t \\, v_{n+1}\\partial\\Phi(v_{n+1}) \\ge \\Delta t \\, \\Phi(v_{n+1}) \\ge 0\n$$\nTherefore, we have demonstrated that $\\,\\Delta D \\ge Y_{n+1}\\Delta\\alpha \\ge 0\\,$. The non-negativity of the discrete dissipation, $\\,\\Delta D \\ge 0\\,$, is guaranteed for any time step size $\\,\\Delta t > 0\\,$ (unconditional stability) provided that our initial assumption holds: **the Helmholtz free energy $\\,\\psi(\\varepsilon, \\alpha)\\,$ must be a convex function of its arguments $\\,(\\varepsilon, \\alpha)\\,$**.\n\nFor the specific energy function $\\,\\psi(\\varepsilon,\\alpha) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,E\\,\\varepsilon^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,H\\,\\alpha^2 + C\\,\\varepsilon\\,\\alpha\\,$, its convexity depends on its Hessian matrix being positive semi-definite. The Hessian is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\psi} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial^2_{\\varepsilon\\varepsilon}\\psi & \\partial^2_{\\varepsilon\\alpha}\\psi \\\\ \\partial^2_{\\alpha\\varepsilon}\\psi & \\partial^2_{\\alpha\\alpha}\\psi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} E & C \\\\ C & H \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $\\,\\mathbf{H}_{\\psi}\\,$ to be positive semi-definite, its principal minors must be non-negative.\n$1.$ The first principal minor is $\\,E \\ge 0\\,$. The problem specifies $\\,E > 0\\,$.\n$2.$ The second principal minor is the determinant, $\\,\\det(\\mathbf{H}_{\\psi}) = EH - C^2 \\ge 0\\,$.\nThus, the sufficient condition for unconditional stability ($\\,\\Delta D \\ge 0\\,$ for all $\\,\\Delta t > 0\\,$) for this specific model is $\\,EH - C^2 \\ge 0\\,$.\n\n### Task B: Algorithmic Implementation and Computation\n\nThe algorithm consists of implementing the backward Euler update for the internal variable $\\,\\alpha\\,$ and then computing the discrete dissipation $\\,\\Delta D\\,$.\n\n**1. Backward Euler Update Algorithm**\nThe evolution of $\\,\\alpha\\,$ is governed by coupling the thermodynamic force definitions at time $\\,t_{n+1}\\,$:\n$$\nY_{n+1} = -\\partial_{\\alpha}\\psi(\\varepsilon_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1}) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad Y_{n+1} = \\partial_v\\Phi(v_{n+1})\n$$\nFor the given functions:\n$\\,\\partial_{\\alpha}\\psi = H\\alpha + C\\varepsilon \\implies Y_{n+1} = -(H\\alpha_{n+1} + C\\varepsilon_{n+1})\\,$\n$\\,\\partial_v\\Phi = \\eta v \\implies Y_{n+1} = \\eta v_{n+1} = \\eta\\frac{\\alpha_{n+1} - \\alpha_n}{\\Delta t}\\,$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\,Y_{n+1}\\,$:\n$$\n\\eta\\frac{\\alpha_{n+1} - \\alpha_n}{\\Delta t} = -H\\alpha_{n+1} - C\\varepsilon_{n+1}\n$$\nThis is a linear equation in $\\,\\alpha_{n+1}\\,$. Solving for $\\,\\alpha_{n+1}\\,$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\Delta t} + H\\right)\\alpha_{n+1} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\Delta t}\\alpha_n - C\\varepsilon_{n+1}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{n+1} = \\frac{\\frac{\\eta}{\\Delta t}\\alpha_n - C\\varepsilon_{n+1}}{\\frac{\\eta}{\\Delta t} + H}\n$$\nThis formula allows for the direct computation of $\\,\\alpha_{n+1}\\,$ given the state at $\\,t_n\\,$ and the prescribed strain $\\,\\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\varepsilon_n + \\Delta\\varepsilon\\,$.\n\n**2. Computation of $\\,\\Delta D\\,$**\nFor each test case, the following steps are sequentially executed:\na. Compute $\\,\\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\varepsilon_n + \\Delta\\varepsilon\\,$.\nb. Compute $\\,\\alpha_{n+1}\\,$ using the derived update formula.\nc. Compute the free energies $\\,\\psi_n = \\psi(\\varepsilon_n, \\alpha_n)\\,$ and $\\,\\psi_{n+1} = \\psi(\\varepsilon_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})\\,$.\nd. Compute the change in free energy $\\,\\Delta\\psi = \\psi_{n+1} - \\psi_n\\,$.\ne. Compute the stress at the end of the step, $\\,\\sigma_{n+1} = E\\varepsilon_{n+1} + C\\alpha_{n+1}\\,$.\nf. Compute the external work input $\\,W_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\sigma_{n+1} \\Delta\\varepsilon\\,$.\ng. Compute the discrete dissipation $\\,\\Delta D = W_{\\mathrm{ext}} - \\Delta\\psi\\,$.\nh. Check if $\\,\\Delta D \\ge -10^{-12}\\,$ to determine the boolean result. The small tolerance accounts for potential floating-point inaccuracies.\n\nFor the given test cases, the condition $\\,EH - C^2 \\ge 0\\,$ is met for cases $1-4$, so we expect $\\,\\Delta D \\ge 0\\,$. For case $5$, $\\,EH - C^2 = 1(0.01) - (0.8)^2 = 0.01 - 0.64 = -0.63 < 0\\,$. The free energy is not convex, so the stability condition is violated, and $\\,\\Delta D\\,$ can be negative.
