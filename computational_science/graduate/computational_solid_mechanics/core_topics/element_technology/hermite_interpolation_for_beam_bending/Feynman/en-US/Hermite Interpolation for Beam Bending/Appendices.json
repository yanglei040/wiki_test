It is a standard derivation in the field of computational solid mechanics, specifically concerning the finite element formulation of Euler–Bernoulli beams. All provided information is consistent, scientifically grounded, and sufficient to derive the required expressions.\n\nThe transverse deflection field $w(x)$ within a single finite element is given as a cubic polynomial:\n$$w(x) = a x^{3} + b x^{2} + c x + d$$\nwhere $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real constants. The flexural rigidity, $EI$, is also constant. We are tasked with deriving the curvature $\\kappa(x)$, bending moment $M(x)$, and shear force $V(x)$ based on the principles of Euler–Bernoulli beam theory.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the curvature, $\\kappa(x)$. For small deflections and rotations, as stipulated by the Euler–Bernoulli assumptions, the curvature is approximated by the second derivative of the transverse deflection with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$.\n$$\\kappa(x) \\approx \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$$\nTo find this, we first compute the first derivative of $w(x)$, which represents the rotation of the beam's neutral axis, $\\theta(x)$:\n$$\\theta(x) = \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(a x^{3} + b x^{2} + c x + d) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$$\nDifferentiating a second time gives the curvature:\n$$\\kappa(x) = \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}(3ax^2 + 2bx + c) = 6ax + 2b$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the bending moment, $M(x)$. The linear elastic moment-curvature relationship for an Euler–Bernoulli beam is:\n$$M(x) = EI \\kappa(x)$$\nSince the flexural rigidity $EI$ is constant, we substitute the expression for $\\kappa(x)$ derived above:\n$$M(x) = EI(6ax + 2b)$$\n\nFinally, we derive the expression for the shear force, $V(x)$. From one-dimensional beam equilibrium, the relationship between shear force and bending moment is given by:\n$$V(x) = \\frac{dM}{dx}$$\nDifferentiating the expression for $M(x)$ with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$V(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[EI(6ax + 2b)]$$\nAs $E$ and $I$ are constants, they can be factored out of the differentiation:\n$$V(x) = EI \\frac{d}{dx}(6ax + 2b) = EI(6a)$$\n\nSummary of polynomial degrees and interpretation:\nThe assumed transverse deflection field, $w(x)$, is a cubic polynomial (degree $3$).\nThe resulting curvature, $\\kappa(x) = 6ax + 2b$, is a linear polynomial (degree $1$).\nThe bending moment, $M(x) = EI(6ax + 2b)$, is also a linear polynomial (degree $1$), as it is directly proportional to the curvature.\nThe shear force, $V(x) = 6aEI$, is a constant (degree $0$).\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of the cubic interpolation for deflection. The choice of a cubic polynomial is the simplest one that allows for four degrees of freedom (deflection and rotation at two nodes), which ensures $C^1$ continuity (continuity of slope) between elements, a requirement for a conforming Euler–Bernoulli beam element. The consequence of this is that the second derivative (curvature) is linear and the third derivative (related to shear) is constant. This implies that the element inherently assumes a constant shear force along its length. Therefore, this finite element formulation cannot exactly represent a varying shear force, which would result from a distributed transverse load $q(x)$ (since $dV/dx = -q(x)$). The effect of such loads is instead approximated and lumped into the nodal forces. This is a fundamental characteristic and limitation of the standard cubic Hermite beam element.",

From $\\kappa(s) = C_0 + C_1s$, this condition is $C_0 + C_1/2 = 0$, or $C_0/C_1 = -1/2$. This corresponds to $r = -1/2$, the very condition that maximizes the relative underestimation $\\delta(q)$.\nFor such a mode, $U_{1\\mathrm{GP}}(q) = 0$. The exact energy is:\n$$U(q) = \\frac{1}{2}EIL \\left( C_0^2 + C_0C_1 + \\frac{1}{3}C_1^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}EIL \\left( \\left(-\\frac{C_1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{C_1}{2}\\right)C_1 + \\frac{1}{3}C_1^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{24}EIL C_1^2$$\nFor this mode to be a non-trivial deformation, we need $C_1 \\neq 0$, which implies $U(q)>0$.\nSince there exist deformation modes for which $U_{1\\mathrm{GP}}(q)=0$ but $U(q)>0$, the one-point Gauss rule does introduce spurious zero-energy modes for this element.\nFor these modes, the relative underestimation is $\\delta(q) = (U(q) - 0)/U(q) = 1$. This confirms that the maximum possible value of $\\delta(q)$ is indeed $1$. This represents a complete failure of the numerical integration to capture the strain energy of certain deformation modes.",
