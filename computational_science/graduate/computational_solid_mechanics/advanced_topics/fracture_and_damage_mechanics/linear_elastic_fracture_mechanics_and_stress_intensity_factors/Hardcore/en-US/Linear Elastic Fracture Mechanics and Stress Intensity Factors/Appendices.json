            "solution": "The problem is well-defined and grounded in the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and the concept of small-scale yielding (SSY). We first validate the problem's parameters and then proceed with a step-by-step solution.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Plate thickness: $t=12\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.012\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Elastic modulus: $E=210\\ \\mathrm{GPa} = 210 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Poisson’s ratio: $\\nu=0.30$\n- Uniaxial yield stress: $\\sigma_{Y}=900\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 900 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Mode I stress intensity factor: $K_{I}=60\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} = 60 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the $J$-integral. In the context of LEFM, the $J$-integral is equivalent to the strain energy release rate, $G$. For a Mode I loading scenario, this relationship is:\n$$J = G_{I} = \\frac{K_{I}^2}{E'}$$\nwhere $E'$ is the effective elastic modulus, which depends on the stress state at the crack tip.\n\nFor an isotropic linear elastic material, the effective modulus $E'$ is defined as:\n- $E' = E$ for plane stress conditions, where the out-of-plane stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is assumed to be zero.\n- $E' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}$ for plane strain conditions, where the out-of-plane strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$ is assumed to be zero.\n\nThe determination of the appropriate stress state (plane stress vs. plane strain) depends on the level of through-thickness constraint at the crack tip. This constraint is governed by the relationship between the plate thickness, $t$, and the size of the plastic zone, $r_p$, that forms at the crack tip. The small-scale yielding (SSY) assumption allows us to estimate the plastic zone size using the elastic stress intensity factor, $K_I$.\n\nThe size of the plastic zone is proportional to the square of the ratio of the stress intensity factor to the yield stress:\n$$r_p \\propto \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nA widely accepted engineering criterion, codified for instance in the ASTM E399 standard for plane-strain fracture toughness testing, provides a quantitative condition for ensuring that plane strain conditions dominate. This criterion states that the thickness $t$ must be much larger than the plastic zone size. The specific requirement is:\n$$t \\ge 2.5 \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nThe right-hand side of this inequality serves as an excellent estimate for the characteristic thickness, which we will call $t_{char}$, at which the stress state transitions from being mixed-mode or plane stress-dominated to being plane strain-dominated. A plate thickness greater than $t_{char}$ implies that the crack tip is under a high degree of constraint, representative of a plane strain state.\n\nLet us compute this characteristic thickness $t_{char}$ using the given values:\n$$t_{char} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nFirst, we compute the ratio $\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}$:\n$$\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} = \\frac{60 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{900 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}} = \\frac{60}{900}\\ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1}{15}\\ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $t_{char}$:\n$$t_{char} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{15}\\ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} \\right)^2 = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{225}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\right) = \\frac{2.5}{225}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.01111\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nConverting this to millimeters:\n$$t_{char} \\approx 11.11\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNow, we compare the actual plate thickness, $t = 12\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, to this characteristic transition thickness, $t_{char} \\approx 11.11\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nSince $t = 12\\ \\mathrm{mm} > t_{char} \\approx 11.11\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, the criterion for plane strain is satisfied. Therefore, we conclude that the crack tip is predominantly in a state of plane strain.\n\nBased on this assessment, we must select the effective modulus $E'$ for plane strain conditions:\n$$E' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}$$\n\nWe can now compute the value of the $J$-integral using the plane strain formula:\n$$J = \\frac{K_I^2 (1 - \\nu^2)}{E}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$J = \\frac{\\left(60 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^2 (1 - 0.30^2)}{210 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}}$$\n$$J = \\frac{3600 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}^2\\mathrm{m} \\cdot (1 - 0.09)}{210 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}}$$\n$$J = \\frac{3600 \\times 10^{12} \\cdot (0.91)}{210 \\times 10^{9}}\\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$J = \\frac{3276 \\times 10^{12}}{210 \\times 10^{9}}\\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$J = \\frac{3276}{210} \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$J = 15.6 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\nThe problem requests the final answer in units of kilojoules per square meter ($\\mathrm{kJ}/\\mathrm{m}^2$).
