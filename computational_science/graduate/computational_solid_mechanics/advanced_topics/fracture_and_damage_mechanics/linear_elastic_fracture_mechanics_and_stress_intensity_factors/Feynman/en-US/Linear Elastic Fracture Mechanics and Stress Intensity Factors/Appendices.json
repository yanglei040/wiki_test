For a crack under mixed-mode loading, the total energy release rate is the sum of contributions from Mode I (opening), Mode II (in-plane shear), and Mode III (anti-plane shear). This exercise  challenges you to calculate the total $G$ from a given set of stress intensity factors ($K_I$, $K_{II}$, $K_{III}$) and apply the Griffith criterion ($G \\ge G_c$) to assess fracture initiation.

It is scientifically grounded within the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of givens, and is objectively formulated. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental task is to compute the total energy release rate, $G$, for a crack under mixed-mode loading and compare it to the material's critical energy release rate, $G_c$, to assess the propensity for crack extension. This is based on Griffith's energy balance criterion, which posits that a crack will grow if the energy supplied by the release of elastic strain energy is at least equal to the energy required to create new fracture surfaces. Irwin established the direct relationship between the energy release rate and the stress intensity factors ($K$).\n\nFor a mixed-mode loading scenario involving Mode I, Mode II, and Mode III, the total energy release rate $G$ is the linear superposition of the energy release rates for each individual mode:\n$$\nG = G_I + G_{II} + G_{III}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that plane strain conditions prevail.

In the context of LEFM, the $J$-integral is equivalent to the strain energy release rate, $G$. For a Mode I loading scenario, this relationship is:\n$$J = G_{I} = \\frac{K_{I}^2}{E'}$$\nwhere $E'$ is the effective elastic modulus, which depends on the stress state at the crack tip.\n\nFor an isotropic linear elastic material, the effective modulus $E'$ is defined as:\n- $E' = E$ for plane stress conditions, where the out-of-plane stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is assumed to be zero.\n- $E' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}$ for plane strain conditions, where the out-of-plane strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$ is assumed to be zero.\n\nThe determination of the appropriate stress state (plane stress vs. plane strain) depends on the level of through-thickness constraint at the crack tip. This constraint is governed by the relationship between the plate thickness, $t$, and the size of the plastic zone, $r_p$, that forms at the crack tip. The small-scale yielding (SSY) assumption allows us to estimate the plastic zone size using the elastic stress intensity factor, $K_I$.\n\nThe size of the plastic zone is proportional to the square of the ratio of the stress intensity factor to the yield stress:\n$$r_p \\propto \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nA widely accepted engineering criterion, codified for instance in the ASTM E399 standard for plane-strain fracture toughness testing, provides a quantitative condition for ensuring that plane strain conditions dominate. This criterion states that the thickness $t$ must be much larger than the plastic zone size. The specific requirement is:\n$$t \\ge 2.5 \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nThe right-hand side of this inequality serves as an excellent estimate for the characteristic thickness, which we will call $t_{char}$, at which the stress state transitions from being mixed-mode or plane stress-dominated to being plane strain-dominated. A plate thickness greater than $t_{char}$ implies that the crack tip is under a high degree of constraint, representative of a plane strain state.\n\nLet us compute this characteristic thickness $t_{char}$ using the given values:\n$$t_{char} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nFirst, we compute the ratio $\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}$:\n$$\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} = \\frac{60 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{900 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}} = \\frac{60}{900}\\ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1}{15}\\ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $t_{char}$:\n$$t_{char} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{15}\\ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} \\right)^2 = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{225}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\right) = \\frac{2.5}{225}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.01111\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nConverting this to millimeters:\n$$t_{char} \\approx 11.11\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNow, we compare the actual plate thickness, $t = 12\\,\\text{mm}$, to this characteristic transition thickness, $t_{char} \\approx 11.11\\,\\text{mm}$.\nSince $t = 12\\,\\text{mm} > t_{char} \\approx 11.11\\,\\text{mm}$, the criterion for plane strain is satisfied.

The determinant of the matrix is $\\cos\\beta_1\\sin\\beta_2 - \\sin\\beta_1\\cos\\beta_2 = \\sin(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)$. A unique solution exists if this determinant is non-zero, i.e., $\\beta_2 - \\beta_1$ is not an integer multiple of $180^\\circ$. Solving for $(K_I^{\\mathrm{est}}, K_{II}^{\\mathrm{est}})$ yields:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} K_I^{\\mathrm{est}} \\\\ K_{II}^{\\mathrm{est}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{E'}{2 K_0^{\\mathrm{aux}} \\sin(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin\\beta_2 & -\\sin\\beta_1 \\\\ -\\cos\\beta_2 & \\cos\\beta_1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} J_1^{\\mathrm{int, meas}} \\\\ J_2^{\\mathrm{int, meas}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis analytical solution will be implemented for each test case. All input parameters given in non-SI units ($E$ in $\\mathrm{GPa}$; $K$ in $\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$) must first be converted to their base SI counterparts ($E$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$; $K$ in $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3/2}$). Angles $\\beta_i$ given in degrees must be converted to radians for use in trigonometric functions.\n\nFinally, the accuracy of the estimation is quantified by the relative error for each mode, defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{err}_I = \\frac{|K_I^{\\mathrm{est}} - K_I^{\\mathrm{true}}|}{|K_I^{\\mathrm{true}}|}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{err}_{II} = \\frac{|K_{II}^{\\mathrm{est}} - K_{II}^{\\mathrm{true}}|}{|K_{II}^{\\mathrm{true}}|}\n$$\nThese error metrics are calculated for each of the four test cases provided, exploring the sensitivity of the results to the choice of auxiliary fields, particularly when they are nearly collinear (Case 3, where $\\beta_2 - \\beta_1$ is small, leading to an ill-conditioned system).",
