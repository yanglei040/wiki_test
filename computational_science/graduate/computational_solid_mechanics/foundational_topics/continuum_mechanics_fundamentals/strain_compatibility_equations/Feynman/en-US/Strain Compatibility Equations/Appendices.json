            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the plane-strain compatibility condition from the fundamental strain-displacement relations, followed by an evaluation of this condition for a given strain field.\n\nThe analysis begins with the provided infinitesimal strain-displacement relations in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2\\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\quad (3)\n$$\nwhere $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are the components of the displacement field.\n\nThe objective is to find a relationship solely among the strain components $\\epsilon_{xx}$, $\\epsilon_{yy}$, and $\\epsilon_{xy}$ by eliminating the displacement components $u$ and $v$. This is achieved by differentiating the expressions above and leveraging the property that for a twice continuously differentiable ($C^2$) displacement field, the order of partial differentiation does not matter (i.e., commutativity of mixed partial derivatives). For the following derivation, we will assume the displacement field is at least $C^3$, which ensures the necessary strain derivatives are continuous and their mixed partials commute.\n\nWe can express the second derivatives of the displacements in terms of the first derivatives of the strains. To eliminate $u$ and $v$, we must form an identity. A common approach involves taking second derivatives of the strain components to relate them through third derivatives of the displacements.\n\nDifferentiate equation (1) twice with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u}{\\partial x \\partial y^2}\n$$\nDifferentiate equation (2) twice with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 v}{\\partial y \\partial x^2}\n$$\nDifferentiate equation (3) once with respect to $x$ and once with respect to $y$:\n$$\n2\\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^3 v}{\\partial y \\partial x^2}\n$$\nIn the expressions above, the commutativity of mixed partial derivatives for sufficiently smooth $u$ and $v$ fields has been used (e.g., $\\frac{\\partial^3 u}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u}{\\partial x \\partial y^2}$).\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for the third-order derivatives of $u$ and $v$ into the last equation:\n$$\n2\\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the required scalar plane-strain compatibility condition, also known as the Saint-Venant compatibility equation for plane problems.

The compatibility condition is satisfied for all points in $\\Omega$, meaning the strain field is locally compatible.\n\nThird, we compute the net change in displacement, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}$, after traversing a counterclockwise circuit around a circle $r=\\rho > a$. The problem defines this jump as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}=\\lim_{\\theta\\to 2\\pi^{-}}\\boldsymbol{u}(\\rho,\\theta)-\\lim_{\\theta\\to 0^{+}}\\boldsymbol{u}(\\rho,\\theta)\n$$\nThis requires evaluating the displacement at the start (as $\\theta \\to 0^+$) and end (as $\\theta \\to 2\\pi^-$) of a full circular path. The displacement field in polar coordinates is $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\rho, \\theta) = \\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\theta \\boldsymbol{e}_{x}$.\nWe evaluate the limits:\nThe starting displacement, as $\\theta$ approaches $0$ from positive values, is:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\theta\\to 0^{+}}\\boldsymbol{u}(\\rho,\\theta) = \\lim_{\\theta\\to 0^{+}} \\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\theta \\boldsymbol{e}_{x} = 0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{e}_{x} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nThe final displacement, after a full circuit as $\\theta$ approaches $2\\pi$ from below, is:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\theta\\to 2\\pi^{-}}\\boldsymbol{u}(\\rho,\\theta) = \\lim_{\\theta\\to 2\\pi^{-}} \\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\theta \\boldsymbol{e}_{x} = \\frac{b}{2\\pi} (2\\pi) \\boldsymbol{e}_{x} = b \\boldsymbol{e}_{x}\n$$\nThe net change in displacement is the difference between these two values:\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u} = b \\boldsymbol{e}_{x} - \\boldsymbol{0} = b \\boldsymbol{e}_{x}\n$$\nThis nonzero vector is the Burgers vector of the dislocation. It represents the closure failure of a loop in the material after deformation. Although the strain field is locally compatible, the displacement field is not single-valued in the multiply connected domain $\\Omega$, leading to this jump.\nThe magnitude of this net change is:\n$$\n|\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}| = |b \\boldsymbol{e}_{x}| = |b| |\\boldsymbol{e}_{x}|\n$$\nSince $b>0$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_{x}$ is a unit vector, $|\\boldsymbol{e}_{x}|=1$. Therefore, the magnitude is:\n$$\n|\\Delta \\boldsymbol{u}| = b\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $b$ has units of length, and the answer should be expressed in meters. The analytical expression for the magnitude is simply $b$.",
