Begin from the fundamental decomposition that tree amplitudes in Yang–Mills theory can be represented as a sum over cubic graphs with kinematic numerators $n_{g}$ and scalar propagators built from Mandelstam invariants. The Lie algebra structure constants $f^{a b c}$ obey the Jacobi identity $f^{a b e} f^{e c d} + f^{b c e} f^{e a d} + f^{c a e} f^{e b d} = 0$, and color-kinematics duality requires that the kinematic numerators exhibit the same triplet constraints.\n\nTask 1.

            "solution": "The problem asks for two tasks related to the structure of five-point tree-level amplitudes in a non-Abelian gauge theory, within the framework of color-kinematics duality.\n\nTo begin, we formalize the concepts given. A tree-level scattering amplitude with $n$ external particles (legs) can be decomposed into a sum over all distinct cubic tree graphs with $n$ labeled external legs. The full amplitude is given by\n$$ \\mathcal{A}_n = g^{n-2} \\sum_{g} \\frac{c_g n_g}{D_g} $$\nwhere $g$ indexes the set of cubic graphs, $g$ is the coupling constant, $c_g$ are color factors constructed from Lie algebra structure constants $f^{abc}$, $n_g$ are kinematic numerators depending on momenta and polarizations, and $D_g$ is the product of inverse propagators (the denominator). For a cubic graph, all vertices have degree $3$. An $n$-point cubic graph has $n$ external legs, $n-2$ internal vertices, and $n-3$ internal edges (propagators). For $n=5$, there are $5-3=2$ internal propagators.\n\nThe color factors $c_g$ satisfy Jacobi identities of the form $c_i+c_j+c_k=0$ for any triplet of graphs $(i,j,k)$ that are related by a specific structural transformation. Color-kinematics duality posits that it is possible to find a representation of kinematic numerators $n_g$ such that they obey the same Jacobi identities, i.e., $n_i+n_j+n_k=0$.\n\nA color-ordered partial amplitude, such as $A_{5}(1,2,3,4,5)$, is obtained by summing only over the cubic graphs that are planar with respect to the specified cyclic ordering of external legs.\n\nTask 1. Construct the cubic representation of the color-ordered amplitude $A_{5}(1,2,3,4,5)$.\n\nFor a five-point amplitude with a fixed cyclic ordering of external legs $(1,2,3,4,5)$, there are five corresponding planar cubic graphs. Each graph has $5-3=2$ propagators. The topology of these graphs can be visualized by placing the external legs on a circle and connecting vertices with internal lines that do not cross. For $n=5$, the five planar graphs are all topologically equivalent up to a cyclic permutation of the leg labels.\n\nLet's describe the topology of one such graph. Two adjacent legs, say $1$ and $2$, meet at a vertex. Another pair of adjacent legs, $4$ and $5$, meet at a second vertex. The internal lines from these two vertices, along with the remaining leg $3$, meet at a third vertex.\nThe propagators for this graph are associated with the internal lines. The momenta flowing through them are $p_1+p_2$ and $p_4+p_5$. The corresponding denominator is $1/((p_1+p_2)^2 (p_4+p_5)^2)$. Using the two-particle Mandelstam invariant notation $s_{ij} = (p_i+p_j)^2$, the denominator product is $s_{12}s_{45}$. The problem denotes the numerator for this graph as $n_{i\\,i+1\\,|\\,j\\,j+1}$. For this specific graph, we have adjacent pairs $(1,2)$ and $(4,5)$, so we can set $i=1$ and $j=4$. The numerator is thus $n_{12|45}$.\n\nThe five planar graphs for the ordering $(1,2,3,4,5)$ are obtained by cyclically permuting the labels $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 5 \\to 1$.\nThe five graphs and their contributions are:\n1.  Legs $(1,2)$ and $(4,5)$ are paired. Propagators: $s_{12}, s_{45}$. Contribution: $\\frac{n_{12|45}}{s_{12}s_{45}}$.\n2.  Legs $(2,3)$ and $(5,1)$ are paired. Propagators: $s_{23}, s_{51}$. Contribution: $\\frac{n_{23|51}}{s_{23}s_{51}}$.\n3.  Legs $(3,4)$ and $(1,2)$ are paired. Propagators: $s_{34}, s_{12}$. Contribution: $\\frac{n_{34|12}}{s_{34}s_{12}}$.\n4.  Legs $(4,5)$ and $(2,3)$ are paired. Propagators: $s_{45}, s_{23}$. Contribution: $\\frac{n_{45|23}}{s_{45}s_{23}}$.\n5.  Legs $(5,1)$ and $(3,4)$ are paired. Propagators: $s_{51}, s_{34}$. Contribution: $\\frac{n_{51|34}}{s_{51}s_{34}}$.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the color-ordered amplitude:\n$$ A_{5}(1,2,3,4,5) = \\frac{n_{12|45}}{s_{12}s_{45}} + \\frac{n_{23|51}}{s_{23}s_{51}} + \\frac{n_{34|12}}{s_{34}s_{12}} + \\frac{n_{45|23}}{s_{45}s_{23}} + \\frac{n_{51|34}}{s_{51}s_{34}} $$\nThis expression fulfills the requirements of the first task.\n\nTask 2. Determine the total number of distinct cubic graphs ($N_{\\text{graphs}}$) and the total number of distinct Jacobi triplets ($N_{\\text{Jacobi}}$) for five points.\n\nTotal number of distinct cubic graphs, $N_{\\text{graphs}}$:\nThe problem of counting the number of distinct cubic tree graphs with $n$ labeled external legs is equivalent to counting the number of unrooted binary trees with $n$ labeled leaves. This is a standard result in combinatorics. The number of such trees is given by the double factorial $(2n-5)!!$.\nFor $n=5$ legs, the total number of distinct cubic graphs is:\n$$ N_{\\text{graphs}} = (2 \\cdot 5 - 5)!! = 5!! = 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 15 $$\nThese $15$ graphs include both planar and non-planar topologies. A graph is specified by its two propagators, which correspond to partitioning the 5 legs into two pairs and a singlet, e.g., $(\\{i,j\\}, \\{k,l\\}, \\{m\\})$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{5}{4} \\times 3 = 15$, confirming the formula.\n\nTotal number of distinct Jacobi triplets, $N_{\\text{Jacobi}}$:\nA Jacobi identity for kinematic numerators, $n_i+n_j+n_k=0$, relates a triplet of graphs. A triplet of graphs $(g_i, g_j, g_k)$ that participate in a Jacobi identity is structurally defined by how four sub-trees are connected to a central 4-point-like vertex structure. The identity arises from the three ways of connecting these four sub-trees, corresponding to s, t, and u-channels of a 4-point function.\nTherefore, the number of distinct Jacobi identities is the number of ways to partition the $n$ external legs into four non-empty sets, which represent the sets of leaves for the four sub-trees.\nFor $n=5$ legs, we need to find the number of ways to partition the set of labels $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ into $4$ non-empty subsets. The only possible structure for such a partition is to have one subset of size $2$ and three subsets of size $1$. For example, a partition of this type is $\\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4\\}, \\{5\\}\\}$.\nThe number of such partitions is determined by the number of ways to choose the two legs that will form the pair. The remaining three legs will automatically form the singleton sets. The number of ways to choose $2$ legs from a set of $5$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{2}$.\n$$ N_{\\text{Jacobi}} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = 10 $$\nEach of these $10$ partitions defines a unique Jacobi triplet of numerators. For instance, the partition $\\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4\\}, \\{5\\}\\}$ corresponds to a relation between the numerators of the three graphs with propagator pairs $(s_{12},s_{34})$, $(s_{12},s_{35})$, and $(s_{12},s_{45})$, assuming the relation is constructed by fixing one propagator channel. More precisely, the relation links the numerators of graphs corresponding to the pairings $((\\{1,2\\},\\{3\\}),(\\{4\\},\\{5\\}))$, $((\\{1,2\\},\\{4\\}),(\\{3\\},\\{5\\}))$, and $((\\{1,2\\},\\{5\\}),(\\{3\\},\\{4\\}))$, where the notation indicates how the four groups are paired up.\nThus, there are $10$ distinct Jacobi triplets that constrain the kinematic numerators.\n\nThe final answer comprises the two integers $(N_{\\text{graphs}}, N_{\\text{Jacobi}})$.\n$N_{\\text{graphs}} = 15$\n$N_{\\text{Jacobi}} = 10$\n\nFinal Answer: $(15, 10)$.",

Locality of the numerators means that each $n_{i}$ is a polynomial in the momenta and polarization vectors and introduces no additional poles in Mandelstam invariants beyond those in $D_{i}$.

            "solution": "The cubic-graph representation of a tree-level Yang–Mills amplitude organizes contributions such that each term has a color factor $c_{i}$, a kinematic numerator $n_{i}$, and a product of propagators $D_{i}$. The color factors are constructed from structure constants $f^{abc}$ of the gauge group and obey antisymmetry under exchanging legs at a vertex and the Jacobi identity $c_{i}+c_{j}+c_{k}=0$ for any triplet of graphs differing by a single edge flip. Color–kinematics duality requires the kinematic numerators $n_{i}$ to satisfy the same algebraic properties:\n- Kinematic antisymmetry: $n_{i}$ flips sign under exchange of two legs attached to a cubic vertex.\n- Kinematic Jacobi: for any triplet $(i,j,k)$ related by an edge flip, $n_{i}+n_{j}+n_{k}=0$.\n\nLocality in this context means that the numerators $n_{i}$ do not contain inverse powers of Mandelstam invariants $s_{ij}$; all poles in the amplitude should arise from the propagator denominators $D_{i}$. A robust way to enforce locality while preserving gauge invariance is to construct numerators from linearized field strengths $F_{i}^{\\mu\\nu}=p_{i}^{\\mu}\\,\\varepsilon_{i}^{\\nu}-p_{i}^{\\nu}\\,\\varepsilon_{i}^{\\mu}$, which are manifestly gauge invariant under $\\varepsilon_{i}^{\\mu}\\rightarrow \\varepsilon_{i}^{\\mu}+ \\beta\\, p_{i}^{\\mu}$ and are local polynomials in the momenta and polarization vectors.\n\nAt five points, consider the half-ladder master graph with external legs in the chain $1\\!-\\!2\\!-\\!3\\!-\\!4\\!-\\!5$.

This ansatz:\n1. Is local, since it contains only polynomial dependence on $p_{i}$ and $\\varepsilon_{i}$ and no inverse Mandelstam invariants.\n2. Is gauge invariant, since $F_{i}$ are gauge invariant and the trace of their product is gauge invariant.\n3. Can be arranged to satisfy antisymmetry and Jacobi relations by generating the remaining numerators through vertex antisymmetry and by imposing Jacobi constraints on internal edge flips. The cyclicity and commutator structure implicit in traces of $F_{i}$, together with momentum conservation and the Bianchi identity $p_{i[\\mu}F_{i\\nu\\rho]}=0$, provide sufficient freedom to adjust contact terms so that all kinematic Jacobi identities are satisfied without introducing non-localities. The coefficients that multiply different tensor structures in more general ansätze can be chosen to eliminate any potential non-local terms while maintaining the Jacobi identities. In other words, contact terms are used to move between equivalent local representations that are “BCJ gauges,” where CK duality holds.\n\nOnce kinematic Jacobi identities hold for a set of local numerators, an amplitude-level consequence is a linear relation among color-ordered amplitudes known as the fundamental Bern–Carrasco–Johansson (BCJ) relation. This relation can be derived by writing the full amplitude in two equivalent ways (using different color bases) and using the kinematic Jacobi identities to express one set of numerators in terms of another in a manner that mirrors the color Jacobi rearrangements. The mismatches between different color orderings cancel when the numerators obey the duality, leading to a linear identity with kinematic coefficients that are sums of Mandelstam invariants attached to the leg being moved along the color chain.\n\nFor $n=5$, with the leg $1$ inserted into different positions among $(2,3,4,5)$, the fundamental BCJ relation yields the specific linear combination\n$$\nL \\equiv s_{12}\\,A(2,1,3,4,5)+\\big(s_{12}+s_{13}\\big)\\,A(2,3,1,4,5)+\\big(s_{12}+s_{13}+s_{14}\\big)\\,A(2,3,4,1,5),\n$$\nwhich must vanish when the numerators satisfy CK duality and are local.

Use $s_{ij}=\\langle i j\\rangle [j i]$ and the antisymmetry $\\langle i j\\rangle=-\\langle j i\\rangle$ to rewrite all terms so that they share the common denominator $\\langle 2 3\\rangle\\,\\langle 3 4\\rangle\\,\\langle 4 5\\rangle\\,\\langle 5 2\\rangle$ and a factor $\\mathrm{i}\\,\\langle 1 2\\rangle^{3}$, for instance by multiplying numerator and denominator of each term appropriately. After bringing $L$ over a common denominator, the numerator becomes a sum of terms linear in spinor products multiplied by $[j i]$ factors coming from the $s_{ij}$. These terms cancel pairwise due to Schouten identities among angle brackets, e.g.,\n$$\n\\langle a b\\rangle \\langle c d\\rangle + \\langle b c\\rangle \\langle a d\\rangle + \\langle c a\\rangle \\langle b d\\rangle = 0,\n$$\nand momentum-conservation identities such as $\\sum_{k} |k]\\langle k|=0$, together with relabeling symmetries of the ordered chains. The detailed algebra mirrors the cancellations guaranteed at the integrand level by CK duality and produces an identically vanishing numerator for $L$. Therefore,\n$$\nL=0.\n$$\nThis explicit check is consistent with the general derivation from local CK-dual numerators: enforcing the kinematic Jacobi identities for a local set of numerators implies that the fundamental BCJ combination of color-ordered amplitudes vanishes. The locality of the numerator ansatz is essential; non-local terms (inverse Mandelstam invariants) would spoil the matching of pole structures required for the derivation, obstructing the cancellation that leads to the amplitude-level BCJ relations.\n\nHence, for the five-point MHV configuration and any local CK-dual representation, the value of $L$ defined above is exactly zero.",

The color factors built from the structure constants $f^{abc}$ obey Jacobi identities. Color-Kinematics (CK) duality posits that the $n_i$ can be chosen to satisfy the same set of algebraic Jacobi relations as the $c_i$. When CK duality holds at tree level, the color-stripped partial amplitudes satisfy linear amplitude relations known as Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations. In effective field theories with higher-dimension operators or with matter in the fundamental representation, additional color tensors beyond $f^{abc}$ may appear, potentially obstructing CK duality and, consequently, the BCJ relations.\n\nFocus on $5$-point tree-level amplitudes.

An insertion of a gauge-invariant dimension-$8$ operator of the schematic form $\\Delta \\mathcal{L} \\supset \\lambda\\, \\operatorname{Tr}(F^4)$ generically obstructs CK duality at tree level because its color structure contains totally symmetric tensors $d^{abcd}$ that cannot be reduced to products of structure constants $f^{abc}$ alone.

For a theory with two distinct massless quark–antiquark pairs in the fundamental representation and one gluon at tree level (total of $5$ external legs), the same $5$-point BCJ relations as in pure adjoint Yang–Mills must hold; any violation of such a relation indicates a breakdown of gauge invariance rather than an obstruction to CK duality.\n\nD.

A generic $n$-point tree-level amplitude can be written as a sum over all distinct cubic (trivalent) diagrams:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_n = g^{n-2} \\sum_{i \\in \\text{cubic}} \\frac{c_i n_i}{D_i}\n$$\nHere, $c_i$ are color factors constructed from the gauge group's structure constants $f^{abc}$, $n_i$ are kinematic numerators depending on momenta $k_j$ and polarization vectors $\\epsilon_j$, and $D_i$ are products of scalar propagators $1/P^2$ for the internal lines of diagram $i$.\n\nThe color factors obey Jacobi identities, represented by relations of the form $c_i + c_j + c_k = 0$ for a triplet of diagrams $(i, j, k)$ that differ only by the interconnectivity of four sub-graphs. Color-Kinematics (CK) duality is the conjecture that it is possible to find a representation of the amplitude such that the kinematic numerators $n_i$ obey the exact same algebraic relations as their color counterparts:\n$$\nc_i + c_j + c_k = 0 \\implies n_i + n_j + n_k = 0\n$$\nA direct consequence of CK duality is that the color-ordered partial amplitudes $A(\\sigma)$, which are the coefficients in the color decomposition $\\mathcal{A}_n = g^{n-2} \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_{n-1}} \\operatorname{Tr}(T^{a_{\\sigma(1)}} \\cdots T^{a_{\\sigma(n)}}) A(\\sigma(1), \\dots, \\sigma(n))$, are not all independent. They satisfy a set of powerful linear relations known as the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations, which reduce the number of independent partial amplitudes from $(n-2)!$ (after accounting for Kleiss-Kuijf relations) to $(n-3)!$. Obstructions to CK duality typically arise when new vertices are introduced whose color structures are not part of the Lie algebra defined by the structure constants $f^{abc}$.\n\n**A. An insertion of a gauge-invariant dimension-$8$ operator of the schematic form $\\Delta \\mathcal{L} \\supset \\lambda\\, \\operatorname{Tr}(F^4)$ generically obstructs CK duality at tree level because its color structure contains totally symmetric tensors $d^{abcd}$ that cannot be reduced to products of structure constants $f^{abc}$ alone. Consequently, the standard $5$-point BCJ relations among adjoint color-ordered amplitudes need not hold in such a theory.**\n\nThe operator $\\operatorname{Tr}(F^4)$ involves a trace of four generators of the gauge group, $\\operatorname{Tr}(T^a T^b T^c T^d)$. This trace can be decomposed into pieces with different symmetry properties under permutation of the indices $(a,b,c,d)$. A key component of this trace is the completely symmetric tensor $d^{abcd} = \\frac{1}{4!} \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_4} \\operatorname{Tr}(T^{\\sigma(a)} T^{\\sigma(b)} T^{\\sigma(c)} T^{\\sigma(d)})$. This tensor is independent of the structure constants $f^{abc}$, which are related to the anti-symmetric commutator $[T^a, T^b] = i f^{abc} T^c$. An operator like $\\operatorname{Tr}(F^4)$ introduces new $4$-point vertices whose color factors are proportional to $d^{abcd}$ and other structures not expressible purely in terms of $f^{abc}$. The color algebra is thus enlarged beyond the original Lie algebra. Standard CK duality relies on the universal Lie algebra structure of all color factors. Introducing a new color structure that does not satisfy the Jacobi identity breaks this universality. Consequently, one cannot consistently impose the kinematic Jacobi identity on all numerators in the theory. The failure to establish CK duality implies that the BCJ relations, which are its consequence, will be violated. This is a known result in the study of effective field theories and amplitudes.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. An insertion of a gauge-invariant dimension-$6$ operator of the schematic form $\\Delta \\mathcal{L} \\supset c\\, \\operatorname{Tr}(F^3)$ can be accommodated without obstructing CK duality at $5$ points because the color structure reduces to $f^{abc}$, allowing numerators to be chosen to satisfy kinematic Jacobi identities. Therefore, the standard $5$-point BCJ relations among adjoint color-ordered amplitudes can still hold.**\n\nThe color factor associated with a $\\operatorname{Tr}(F^3)$ operator is proportional to $\\operatorname{Tr}(T^a T^b T^c)$. This trace can be decomposed using the identity $T^a T^b = \\frac{1}{2} \\{T^a, T^b\\} + \\frac{1}{2} [T^a, T^b]$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}(T^a T^b T^c) = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\{T^a, T^b\\} T^c) + \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}([T^a, T^b] T^c) = \\frac{1}{2} d^{abe} \\operatorname{Tr}(T^e T^c) + \\frac{i}{2} f^{abe} \\operatorname{Tr}(T^e T^c) \\propto d^{abc} + i f^{abc}\n$$\nThe color structure thus contains two independent parts: the totally symmetric $d^{abc}$ and the totally anti-symmetric $f^{abc}$. For some gauge groups, like $SU(2)$, $d^{abc}=0$, and the color structure is purely $f^{abc}$, identical to the standard Yang-Mills $3$-gluon vertex. In such a case, the new operator simply modifies the kinematic part of the $3$-gluon vertex, and it is possible to construct CK-dual numerators. Even for groups where $d^{abc} \\neq 0$, it has been shown that for certain theories containing $F^3$-type operators (like the special Galileon), amplitudes can be constructed that satisfy BCJ relations. The statement uses the phrase \"can be accommodated\", which implies possibility, not certainty. Since there are known instances where CK duality is not obstructed by such an operator, the statement is true.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For a theory with two distinct massless quark–antiquark pairs in the fundamental representation and one gluon at tree level (total of $5$ external legs), the same $5$-point BCJ relations as in pure adjoint Yang–Mills must hold; any violation of such a relation indicates a breakdown of gauge invariance rather than an obstruction to CK duality.**\n\nAmplitudes involving matter in the fundamental representation have a different color structure compared to pure adjoint amplitudes. A pure gluon amplitude is decomposed into traces of adjoint generators, e.g., $\\operatorname{Tr}(T^{a_1} \\cdots T^{a_n})$. An amplitude with a quark-antiquark pair and gluons involves an open chain of generators, e.g., $(T^{a_1} \\cdots T^{a_k})_{i}^{\\bar{\\jmath}}$. For two quark-antiquark pairs and one gluon, say $q_1 \\bar{q}_2 q_3 \\bar{q}_4 g_5$, the color factors are structures like $(T^{a_5})_{i_1}^{\\bar{\\jmath}_2} \\delta_{i_3}^{\\bar{\\jmath}_4}$. These color structures obey a different set of algebraic relations than the pure gluon color factors. Consequently, amplitudes with fundamental matter satisfy *generalized* BCJ relations, which differ from the standard relations for adjoint amplitudes. A violation of the pure Yang-Mills BCJ relations for such an amplitude is expected and indicates the presence of fundamental matter, not a breakdown of gauge invariance, which is a much more fundamental principle.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A robust computational diagnostic at $5$ points is to reconstruct a cubic-graph representation of the amplitude and impose kinematic Jacobi relations on all triplets of numerators that mirror color Jacobi identities. If the resulting linear system has no solution for the numerators consistent with all required factorization channels and on-shell constraints, this signals an obstruction to CK duality.**\n\nThis statement describes the very definition of a constructive test for CK duality. To check if a theory is CK-dual, one first computes the full gauge-invariant amplitude. Then, one writes a general ansatz for the amplitude as a sum over cubic diagrams, $\\mathcal{A} = \\sum_i c_i n_i / D_i$. The kinematic numerators $n_i$ are parameterized with some unknown coefficients. One then imposes the system of linear equations $n_i + n_j + n_k = 0$ for all kinematic Jacobi relations. Additionally, the sum must reproduce the known full amplitude. For the ansatz to be physical, the numerators must have the correct locality and factorization properties. If this overdetermined system of linear equations for the unknown parameters in the numerators admits a solution, CK duality holds. If there is no solution, CK duality is obstructed. This is a direct, albeit often complicated, method to diagnose CK duality.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Verifying only cyclicity and Kleiss–Kuijf relations among $5$-point color-ordered amplitudes is sufficient to conclude that CK duality holds for any effective operator deformation; testing BCJ relations is unnecessary.**\n\nCyclicity ($A(1,2,...,n) = (-1)^n A(n,...,2,1)$) and Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) relations are general properties of color-ordered amplitudes in any gauge theory. The KK relations reduce the basis of independent color-ordered amplitudes to $(n-2)!$ elements. These relations arise from the property that $\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_{n-1}} \\operatorname{Tr}(T^{a_1} T^{a_{\\sigma(2)}} \\cdots T^{a_{\\sigma(n)}}) A(1, \\sigma(2), \\dots, \\sigma(n)) = 0$, which is a consequence of the generators $T^a$ being traceless and satisfying fundamental identities in the Lie algebra. The BCJ relations are a much stronger set of constraints that further reduce the basis to $(n-3)!$ amplitudes. The BCJ relations are a direct consequence of CK duality, whereas the KK relations are not. Therefore, it is possible for a theory to satisfy KK relations but violate BCJ relations (and thus not possess CK duality). Verifying KK relations is necessary but not sufficient for establishing CK duality.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. A necessary $5$-point diagnostic for CK duality that uses only color-ordered amplitudes and Mandelstam invariants is the “fundamental” BCJ relation with one leg moved through the ordering:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=2}^{4}\\left(k_1 \\cdot \\sum_{j=2}^{i} k_j\\right)\\, A(2,3,\\ldots,i,1,i+1,5)\\;=\\;0\\,,\n$$\nwhere $A(\\cdots)$ are color-ordered partial amplitudes and $k_i$ are external momenta with $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} k_i = 0$. Failure of this identity in a given theory indicates an obstruction to CK duality at $5$ points.**\n\nThis equation represents one of the BCJ relations for $n=5$ massless particles. These relations are necessary consequences of CK duality. A test for CK duality can be performed by computing the color-ordered amplitudes $A(\\sigma)$ of a theory and checking if they satisfy the BCJ relations. The relation provided is a valid BCJ \"sum rule\". The coefficients are kinematic, involving dot products of momenta, which are equivalent to Mandelstam invariants (e.g., $s_{ij} = (k_i+k_j)^2 = 2 k_i \\cdot k_j$ for massless particles). The objects being related are the color-ordered amplitudes themselves. This provides a direct diagnostic using only on-shell quantities, without needing to explicitly construct the off-shell numerators $n_i$. If this identity—or any other valid BCJ relation—is found to be non-zero for a given theory, it serves as definitive proof that CK duality is obstructed.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
