The theoretical framework invoked—Fermi’s Golden Rule, two-body phase space, and the impulse approximation—is standard. The use of an effective mass for the bound nucleon is a common phenomenological approach (e.g., in the context of the Fermi gas model). All approximations are explicitly stated and are typical for a simplified, pedagogical treatment of the subject. The numerical values for the particle masses and the separation energy are physically realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem requests a specific, calculable quantity, $S(E_{\\nu})$. It provides all necessary data and a clear set of physical approximations to define the calculation. The objective is unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjectivity or bias.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is valid. It is a well-defined physics problem based on established principles and standard approximations.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe differential cross section for a scattering process is given by Fermi's Golden Rule. For the process $\\nu_{\\ell} + n \\to \\ell^{-} + p$, the total cross section $\\sigma(\\nu_{\\ell})$ is obtained by integrating the differential cross section over the final-state phase space:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\nu_{\\ell}) = \\int |\\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}|^2 d\\Phi_{\\ell}\n$$\nwhere $|\\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}|^2$ is the squared transition matrix element for lepton flavor $\\ell$, and $d\\Phi_{\\ell}$ is the two-body Lorentz-invariant phase space element for the final state $(\\ell^{-}, p)$.\n\nThe problem states that the hadronic transition matrix element is independent of the lepton flavor. This implies that if we integrate out the spin and angular dependence, the remaining kinematic part of the matrix element is also flavor-independent. To a first approximation, we treat $|\\mathcal{M}_e|^2 \\approx |\\mathcal{M}_\\mu|^2 \\approx |\\mathcal{M}|^2$ as a constant factor with respect to the kinematic variables that differ between the electron and muon final states.\n\nThe suppression factor $S(E_{\\nu})$ is the ratio of the total cross sections:\n$$\nS(E_{\\nu}) = \\frac{\\sigma(\\nu_{\\mu})}{\\sigma(\\nu_{e})} = \\frac{\\int |\\mathcal{M}_{\\mu}|^2 d\\Phi_{\\mu}}{\\int |\\mathcal{M}_{e}|^2 d\\Phi_{e}} \\approx \\frac{\\int d\\Phi_{\\mu}}{\\int d\\Phi_{e}} = \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{total}}(\\mu)}{\\Phi_{\\text{total}}(e)}\n$$\nThus, the ratio of cross sections is determined by the ratio of the available phase space volumes for the final states.\n\nThe problem provides a crucial simplification for the kinematics: the outgoing lepton energy is approximated as a constant value, $E_{\\ell} \\approx E_{\\nu} - \\Delta_{Q}$. This approximation is consistent with the heavy-baryon limit where the kinetic energy of the recoiling proton is neglected. Under this approximation, the lepton energy $E_{\\ell}$ is the same for both the electron and muon final states. Let us denote this fixed energy as $E'_{\\ell} = E_{\\nu} - \\Delta_{Q}$.\n\nWith a fixed final lepton energy, we do not integrate over a range of $E_{\\ell}$. Instead, the concept of \"available two-body phase space\" refers to the phase space density at this specific kinematic point. The density of states for a free particle of mass $m_{\\ell}$ and energy $E_{\\ell}$ is proportional to the product of its energy and momentum magnitude, $E_{\\ell} |\\vec{k}_{\\ell}|$. The factor $|\\vec{k}_{\\ell}|$ arises from the phase space volume element, $|\\vec{k}_{\\ell}|^2 d|\\vec{k}_{\\ell}|$, and the Jacobian $d|\\vec{k}_{\\ell}|/dE_{\\ell} = E_{\\ell}/|\\vec{k}_{\\ell}|$ gives the $E_{\\ell}$ factor. Thus, we can approximate the total cross section as being proportional to this factor:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\nu_{\\ell}) \\propto E_{\\ell} |\\vec{k}_{\\ell}|\n$$\nThis assumes all other kinematic factors in the cross section are approximately flavor-independent.\n\nThe magnitude of the lepton's momentum, $|\\vec{k}_{\\ell}|$, is determined by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $|\\vec{k}_{\\ell}| = \\sqrt{E_{\\ell}^2 - m_{\\ell}^2}$.\n\nUsing our approximation $E_{e} = E_{\\mu} = E'_{\\ell}$, the suppression factor becomes the ratio of the final-state lepton momenta:\n$$\nS(E_{\\nu}) = \\frac{E'_{\\ell} |\\vec{k}_{\\mu}|}{E'_{\\ell} |\\vec{k}_{e}|} = \\frac{|\\vec{k}_{\\mu}|}{|\\vec{k}_{e}|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(E'_{\\ell})^2 - m_{\\mu}^2}}{\\sqrt{(E'_{\\ell})^2 - m_{e}^2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $E'_{\\ell} = E_{\\nu} - \\Delta_Q$ gives the final closed-form expression for the suppression factor:\n$$\nS(E_{\\nu}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{(E_{\\nu} - \\Delta_Q)^2 - m_{\\mu}^2}{(E_{\\nu} - \\Delta_Q)^2 - m_{e}^2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_Q = M_{p} - M_{n} + \\varepsilon_{B}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values.\nFirst, calculate the energy transfer $\\Delta_Q$:\n$$\n\\Delta_Q = M_{p} - M_{n} + \\varepsilon_{B} = 938.272\\,\\text{MeV} - 939.565\\,\\text{MeV} + 25\\,\\text{MeV} = 23.707\\,\\text{MeV}\n$$\nNext, calculate the final lepton energy $E'_{\\ell}$ for the given neutrino energy $E_{\\nu} = 300\\,\\text{MeV}$:\n$$\nE'_{\\ell} = E_{\\nu} - \\Delta_Q = 300\\,\\text{MeV} - 23.707\\,\\text{MeV} = 276.293\\,\\text{MeV}\n$$\nThe reaction is kinematically allowed since $E'_{\\ell}  m_{\\mu}$ ($276.293\\,\\text{MeV}  105.658\\,\\text{MeV}$).\n\nNow, we compute the squared momenta for the muon and the electron:\n$$\n|\\vec{k}_{\\mu}|^2 = (E'_{\\ell})^2 - m_{\\mu}^2 = (276.293\\,\\text{MeV})^2 - (105.658\\,\\text{MeV})^2\n$$\n$$\n|\\vec{k}_{\\mu}|^2 = 76337.817449\\,\\text{MeV}^2 - 11163.606564\\,\\text{MeV}^2 = 65174.210885\\,\\text{MeV}^2\n$$\n$$\n|\\vec{k}_{e}|^2 = (E'_{\\ell})^2 - m_{e}^2 = (276.293\\,\\text{MeV})^2 - (0.511\\,\\text{MeV})^2\n$$\n$$\n|\\vec{k}_{e}|^2 = 76337.817449\\,\\text{MeV}^2 - 0.261121\\,\\text{MeV}^2 = 76337.556328\\,\\text{MeV}^2\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the suppression factor $S(E_{\\nu})$:\n$$\nS(300\\,\\text{MeV}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{65174.210885}{76337.556328}} = \\sqrt{0.85377033...} \\approx 0.92399693\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.9240$.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear and particle physics, mathematically well-posed, internally consistent, and provides all necessary information to construct a unique, verifiable computational solution.\n\nThe problem requires a computational study of the scaling of the quasi-elastic (QE) neutrino-nucleus cross section, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}$, with the nuclear mass number, $A$. The core of the task is to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ in the power-law relationship $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(A) \\propto A^{\\alpha}$ for several phenomenological models. The exponent $\\alpha$ provides insight into whether the interaction is a volume effect (where $\\alpha \\approx 1$), a surface effect (where $\\alpha \\approx 2/3$), or a mixture thereof.\n\nThe solution is implemented via the following sequential, principle-based steps:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Cross Section Calculation**: The total cross section is modeled as a product of an effective nucleon count and a flux-weighted per-nucleon interaction strength:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(A) = N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(A) \\cdot I_{\\phi\\sigma}\n    $$\n    The effective nucleon count, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}(A) = s_v\\,c_v\\,A_{\\mathrm{v}}(A) + s_s\\,c_s\\,A_{\\mathrm{s}}(A)$, depends on the mass number $A$ and model parameters $(c_v, c_s, s_v, s_s)$. The flux-weighted integral, $I_{\\phi\\sigma} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\phi(E)\\,\\sigma_N(E)\\,\\mathrm{d}E$, depends on energy parameters. As the energy parameters ($E_0, E_c$) and the cross section amplitude $\\sigma_1$ are constant across all five specified models, the term $I_{\\phi\\sigma}$ is a constant factor that can be computed once.\n\n2.  **Numerical Evaluation of the Flux-Weighted Integral ($I_{\\phi\\sigma}$)**: The integral term combines the per-nucleon cross section $\\sigma_N(E)$ and the neutrino flux $\\phi(E)$:\n    $$\n    I_{\\phi\\sigma} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{E^2}{2 E_c^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{E_c}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\sigma_1\\,\\frac{E^2}{E^2 + E_0^2} \\right) \\mathrm{d}E = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{2 E_c^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{E^4 e^{-E/E_c}}{E^2 + E_0^2} \\mathrm{d}E\n    $$\n    This definite integral does not possess a simple analytical solution and must be evaluated numerically.

We use the given constants $E_0 = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $E_c = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\\sigma_1 = 0.9 \\times 10^{-38}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\n3.  **Calculation of Effective Nucleon Counts ($A_{\\mathrm{v}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{s}}$)**: The nucleus is modeled as a uniform-density sphere with radius $R(A) = r_0 A^{1/3}$. The nuclear density, $\\rho_0 = (\\frac{4\\pi}{3} r_0^3)^{-1}$, is self-consistently defined. The surface nucleon count, $A_{\\mathrm{s}}(A)$, represents nucleons in a shell of thickness $t$.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n    $$\n    \\ln(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(A)) = \\alpha \\ln(A) + \\ln(C)\n    $$\n    This is a linear equation of the form $y = m x + b$, with $y = \\ln(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(A))$, $x = \\ln(A)$, slope $m = \\alpha$, and intercept $b = \\ln(C)$. The slope $\\alpha$ is calculated using a standard linear regression algorithm. A point $(A, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(A))$ is excluded from the regression if $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(A) \\le 0$, as the logarithm would be undefined. This occurs in Model $1$ for $A=1$, where $A_v(1) = 0$ making $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(1)=0$. This regression is performed three times for each model:\n    a. On all valid data points for $A \\in \\{1,\\,12,\\,16,\\,27,\\,40,\\,56,\\,63,\\,108,\\,208\\}$.\n    b. On the subset of light nuclei with $A \\leq 40$.\n    c. On the subset of heavy nuclei with $A \\geq 56$.\n\n5.  **Algorithmic Implementation**: A Python script automates this process. First, it defines all constants and the list of mass numbers $A$. It computes the constant integral $I_{\\phi\\sigma}$ using `scipy.integrate.quad`. Then, it iterates through the five models. For each model, it calculates $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(A)$ for all aformentioned values of $A$. After filtering out non-positive cross sections, it prepares arrays of $\\ln(A)$ and $\\ln(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{QE}}(A))$ for the three analysis subsets.

This advanced practice guides you through implementing a factorized model that includes both channels, focusing on how a key parameter in the 2p2h model—the pion form factor cutoff $\\Lambda_{\\pi}$—influences the total predicted cross section. By performing a sensitivity study, you will practice a technique fundamental to evaluating the theoretical uncertainties inherent in our models of nuclear dynamics. ",

            "problem": "Consider charged-current inclusive neutrino–nucleus scattering at neutrino energy $E_\\nu$ on a spin-saturated, isoscalar target. The total inclusive cross section per nucleon, $\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi)$, can be modeled as the sum of a quasi-elastic component and a two-particle–two-hole (2p2h) meson-exchange current component. The purpose of this problem is to explore and quantify how the inclusive cross section responds to changes in the pion form-factor cutoff $\\Lambda_\\pi$ by propagating that change into the 2p2h strength.\n\nStarting point and assumptions:\n- The inclusive cross section is determined by the contraction of the leptonic and hadronic tensors integrated over the allowed kinematics. In a factorized model, one may treat mechanisms as additive: $\\sigma_{\\text{inc}} = \\sigma_{\\text{QE}} + \\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}$, where $\\sigma_{\\text{QE}}$ is the quasi-elastic contribution and $\\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}$ is the meson-exchange current contribution leading to two-nucleon emission.\n- Take the Fermi coupling constant $G_F$ and the Cabibbo angle factor $\\cos\\theta_C$ as known and fixed, and assume an approximate upper limit on the four-momentum transfer squared given by $Q^2_{\\max} \\approx 2 m_N E_\\nu$, where $m_N$ is the nucleon mass. This provides a finite integration range for the kinematic integrals in this model.\n- For the quasi-elastic component, model the squared nucleon vector and axial form factors by dipole forms with vector mass $M_V$ and axial mass $M_A$, respectively, and axial charge $g_A(0)$. In this simplified energy-averaged model, approximate the quasi-elastic strength as a weighted integral over $Q^2 \\in [0,Q^2_{\\max}]$. \n- For the two-particle–two-hole component, assume that the transverse meson-exchange current response is modulated by the pion form factor with cutoff $\\Lambda_\\pi$ and by a smooth kinematic weight. Take the pion form factor to be a monopole in $Q^2$, and assume that the energy dependence enters via a smooth factor that saturates at high $E_\\nu$.\n\nDefinitions and parameters:\n- Let $G_F$ be the Fermi coupling constant in $\\mathrm{GeV}^{-2}$, $\\cos\\theta_C$ be the cosine of the Cabibbo angle, and $m_N$ be the nucleon mass in $\\mathrm{GeV}$.\n- Define the conversion $C_{\\mathrm{conv}}$ from $\\mathrm{GeV}^{-2}$ to $\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n- The quasi-elastic contribution is modeled as\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{QE}}(E_\\nu) = S_0 \\, G_F^2 \\cos^2\\theta_C \\, E_\\nu \\, m_N \\, \\mathcal{I}_{\\text{QE}}(Q^2_{\\max}),\n$$\nwhere $S_0$ is a dimensionless scaling constant and\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}_{\\text{QE}}(Q^2_{\\max}) = \\int_{0}^{Q^2_{\\max}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{Q^2}{M_V^2}}\\right)^4 + g_A(0)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{Q^2}{M_A^2}}\\right)^4 \\right] \\, dQ^2.\n$$\n- The two-particle–two-hole contribution is modeled as\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi) = S_1 \\, G_F^2 \\cos^2\\theta_C \\, E_\\nu \\, m_N \\, \\frac{E_\\nu}{E_\\nu + E_0} \\, \\mathcal{I}_{\\text{2p2h}}(Q^2_{\\max};\\Lambda_\\pi),\n$$\nwhere $S_1$ is a dimensionless scaling constant, $E_0$ is a smooth energy scale, and\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}_{\\text{2p2h}}(Q^2_{\\max};\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\int_{0}^{Q^2_{\\max}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{Q^2}{\\beta}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Lambda_\\pi^2}{\\Lambda_\\pi^2 + Q^2}\\right)^2 \\, dQ^2.\n$$\n- The pion form factor is $F_\\pi(Q^2;\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\frac{\\Lambda_\\pi^2}{\\Lambda_\\pi^2 + Q^2}$, and it enters squared into the 2p2h integrand to represent the dominance of low $Q^2$ pion exchange suppressed by the cutoff.\n\nTasks:\n- Implement a program that computes $\\sigma_{\\text{QE}}(E_\\nu)$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi)$ using the above definitions and then forms the inclusive cross section per nucleon:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\sigma_{\\text{QE}}(E_\\nu) + \\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi).\n$$\n- Use the following constants:\n    - $G_F = 1.1663787 \\times 10^{-5}$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}^{-2}$,\n    - $\\cos\\theta_C = 0.97420$,\n    - $m_N = 0.939$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}$,\n    - $C_{\\mathrm{conv}} = 0.389379 \\times 10^{-27}$ in $\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{GeV}^{-2}$,\n    - $M_V = 0.84$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}$,\n    - $M_A = 1.03$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}$,\n    - $g_A(0) = 1.267$,\n    - $E_0 = 0.2$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}$,\n    - $\\beta = 0.6$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}^2$,\n    - $S_0 = 0.2$,\n    - $S_1 = 0.08$.\n- The program must express the final cross sections in units of $10^{-38} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2$ per nucleon. That is, divide the computed $\\mathrm{cm}^2$ cross sections by $10^{-38}$ to produce dimensionless numbers that represent the cross section in units of $10^{-38} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n- To quantify sensitivity, define a reference cutoff $\\Lambda_\\pi^{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}$ and compute the ratio\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}(E_\\nu,\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi)}{\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi^{\\mathrm{ref}})}.\n$$\n\nTest suite:\n- Use the neutrino energies $E_\\nu \\in \\{0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0\\}$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}$.\n- Use the pion cutoff values $\\Lambda_\\pi \\in \\{0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4\\}$ in $\\mathrm{GeV}$.\n- Form all combinations of $(E_\\nu,\\Lambda_\\pi)$ from these sets (a total of $20$ test cases), compute $\\mathcal{S}(E_\\nu,\\Lambda_\\pi)$ for each, and aggregate the results.\n\nFinal output specification:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the $20$ sensitivity ratios in the order induced by iterating $E_\\nu$ in ascending order and, for each $E_\\nu$, iterating $\\Lambda_\\pi$ in ascending order. The line must be a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $\\texttt{[result1,result2,\\dots]}$). No other text should be printed.",
            "solution": "The starting point is the decomposition of the inclusive cross section into additive mechanisms that contribute to the hadronic tensor. In charged-current neutrino–nucleus scattering, a commonly used factorization is to consider the quasi-elastic (single-nucleon knockout) channel and the two-particle–two-hole meson-exchange current channel, so that one writes\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\sigma_{\\text{QE}}(E_\\nu) + \\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi).\n$$\nThis separation is consistent with treating distinct many-body responses as incoherent in an inclusive observable and is grounded in the general expression for the double differential cross section,\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\sigma}{d\\Omega \\, dE'} = \\frac{G_F^2 \\cos^2\\theta_C}{4\\pi^2} \\, k' E' \\sum_{i} v_i(E_\\nu, E', \\theta) R_i(q,\\omega),\n$$\nwhere $R_i$ are nuclear response functions depending on the energy transfer $\\omega$ and three-momentum transfer $q$, and the $v_i$ are kinematic coefficients determined by the leptonic tensor. Integrating over final lepton kinematics, one can form energy-averaged strengths of each response channel. In a simplified model focused on the parametric sensitivity to the pion cutoff, it is natural to absorb the detailed angular phase space and many-body dynamics into leading-order integrals in $Q^2$ with physically motivated form factors.\n\nFor the quasi-elastic part, the dominant nucleon form factors are modeled by dipoles. Denoting the vector dipole mass by $M_V$ and the axial dipole mass by $M_A$, and the axial charge at zero momentum transfer by $g_A(0)$, the squared form factors are taken as\n$$\n|F_V(Q^2)|^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{Q^2}{M_V^2}}\\right)^4, \\qquad |F_A(Q^2)|^2 \\approx g_A(0)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{Q^2}{M_A^2}}\\right)^4.\n$$\nWe then define the energy-averaged quasi-elastic strength as\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}_{\\text{QE}}(Q^2_{\\max}) = \\int_{0}^{Q^2_{\\max}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{Q^2}{M_V^2}}\\right)^4 + g_A(0)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{Q^2}{M_A^2}}\\right)^4 \\right] \\, dQ^2,\n$$\nwhere the upper limit $Q^2_{\\max} \\approx 2 m_N E_\\nu$ captures the approximate kinematic reach for fixed-target scattering on a nucleon at rest.

A widely used monopole form is\n$$\nF_\\pi(Q^2;\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\frac{\\Lambda_\\pi^2}{\\Lambda_\\pi^2 + Q^2},\n$$\nso that $|F_\\pi|^2$ suppresses large $Q^2$ contributions. To represent the smooth phase space and multi-nucleon correlations, use a kinematic weight that suppresses large $Q^2$ exponentially and approaches a constant with neutrino energy,\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}_{\\text{2p2h}}(Q^2_{\\max};\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\int_{0}^{Q^2_{\\max}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{Q^2}{\\beta}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Lambda_\\pi^2}{\\Lambda_\\pi^2 + Q^2}\\right)^2 \\, dQ^2,\n$$\nwith a positive $\\beta$ controlling the $Q^2$ fall-off. The energy dependence enters via a factor $\\frac{E_\\nu}{E_\\nu+E_0}$ that smoothly saturates, with $E_0$ a scale parameter.

To convert to $\\mathrm{cm}^2$, multiply by the factor $C_{\\mathrm{conv}}$ that converts $\\mathrm{GeV}^{-2}$ to $\\mathrm{cm}^2$,\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cm^2}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{GeV}^{-2}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{conv}},\n$$\nand then divide by $10^{-38}$ to express in units of $10^{-38} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\nSensitivity metric:\nTo quantify the effect of changing $\\Lambda_\\pi$, fix a reference cutoff $\\Lambda_\\pi^{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$ and define\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}(E_\\nu,\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{QE}}(E_\\nu) + \\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi)}{\\sigma_{\\text{QE}}(E_\\nu) + \\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi^{\\mathrm{ref}})}.\n$$\nThis ratio is dimensionless, equals $1$ at $\\Lambda_\\pi = \\Lambda_\\pi^{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and isolates the change in the inclusive strength arising from the pion cutoff propagated through the 2p2h channel.\n\nAlgorithmic steps:\n- For each test energy $E_\\nu$, compute $Q^2_{\\max} = 2 m_N E_\\nu$.\n- Compute $\\mathcal{I}_{\\text{QE}}(Q^2_{\\max})$ using the closed-form expression for the dipole integrals with $(M_V, M_A, g_A(0))$.\n- Compute $\\sigma_{\\text{QE}}(E_\\nu)$ with the given $S_0$ and constants, convert to $\\mathrm{cm}^2$, then to units of $10^{-38} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n- For each $\\Lambda_\\pi$ in the test set, numerically evaluate $\\mathcal{I}_{\\text{2p2h}}(Q^2_{\\max};\\Lambda_\\pi)$ over $Q^2 \\in [0,Q^2_{\\max}]$, using a stable quadrature such as adaptive integration with a relative tolerance suitable for smooth integrands.\n- Compute $\\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi)$ with the given $S_1$, convert units as above, and then form $\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi) = \\sigma_{\\text{QE}}(E_\\nu) + \\sigma_{\\text{2p2h}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi)$.\n- Compute the reference $\\sigma_{\\text{inc}}(E_\\nu;\\Lambda_\\pi^{\\mathrm{ref}})$ at $\\Lambda_\\pi^{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$ and form $\\mathcal{S}(E_\\nu,\\Lambda_\\pi)$ for each test case.\n- Aggregate the $20$ sensitivity ratios in the required order and print them as a single comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n\nCoverage and edge cases:\n- The test energies $E_\\nu \\in \\{0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0\\}$ probe low, intermediate, and high energy regimes relevant to accelerator neutrinos. At low $E_\\nu$ the quasi-elastic dominates and $\\mathcal{S}$ remains close to $1$ because the 2p2h fraction is small. As $E_\\nu$ increases, the 2p2h strength grows via the $\\frac{E_\\nu}{E_\\nu+E_0}$ factor and sensitivity to $\\Lambda_\\pi$ increases.\n- The cutoff set $\\Lambda_\\pi \\in \\{0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4\\} \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$ spans a reasonable range used in nuclear models, testing suppression/enhancement effects in the pion-mediated current.\n- Numerical integration is well-conditioned because the integrand is smooth, strictly positive on the finite interval, and rapidly decaying; adaptive quadrature with modest tolerances yields stable results.\n\nThe final program implements these steps, adheres to the unit specifications, and outputs the required sensitivity ratios in the prescribed format.",
