A key result is the direct relationship between a quasiparticle's energy and the occupation probability of the underlying single-particle states. This exercise  challenges you to derive this fundamental relationship by diagonalizing the $2 \\times 2$ HFB matrix for a time-reversed pair of states. Mastering this derivation is essential for understanding how pairing correlations redistribute particles among orbitals near the Fermi surface, creating a \"smeared\" occupation profile and solidifying your grasp of the core quantities $\\epsilon_\\alpha$, $\\lambda$, $\\Delta_\\alpha$, and $E_\\alpha$.",

            "problem": "Consider an odd nucleus described within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) formalism, where the odd nucleon is treated by quasiparticle blocking of a single canonical orbital $b$ on top of an even-even HFB vacuum. In the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit of HFB, the canonical basis diagonalizes the single-particle mean field and the pairing field couples time-reversed partners. The quasiparticle energies in the canonical basis are given by $E_{\\alpha}=\\sqrt{(\\epsilon_{\\alpha}-\\lambda)^{2}+\\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}}$, where $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$ is the canonical single-particle energy, $\\lambda$ is the chemical potential, and $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$ is the canonical pairing gap.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution consists of three parts: first, the derivation of the canonical occupation probability; second, an explanation of its modification under quasiparticle blocking; and third, a numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Occupation Probability $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$**\n\nIn the BCS limit of the HFB theory, the HFB matrix $\\mathcal{H}$ is block-diagonal in the canonical basis. Each block corresponds to a pair of time-reversed states, which we denote by $(\\alpha, \\bar{\\alpha})$. The basis for each $2 \\times 2$ block is spanned by the particle creation and annihilation operators, which can be written in the Nambu-Gor'kov space as $(c_{\\alpha}^{\\dagger}, c_{\\bar{\\alpha}})$. The corresponding HFB matrix block is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda & \\Delta_{\\alpha} \\\\ \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{*} & -(\\epsilon_{\\bar{\\alpha}} - \\lambda) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$ is the canonical single-particle energy, $\\lambda$ is the chemical potential, and $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$ is the pairing gap which couples states $\\alpha$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}$. In the standard canonical basis with time-reversal symmetry, we have $\\epsilon_{\\alpha} = \\epsilon_{\\bar{\\alpha}}$. We can also choose a phase convention such that $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$ is real and positive, so $\\Delta_{\\alpha}^{*} = \\Delta_{\\alpha}$. The matrix simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda & \\Delta_{\\alpha} \\\\ \\Delta_{\\alpha} & -(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe HFB problem is solved by diagonalizing this matrix to find the quasiparticle energies $E_{\\alpha}$ and the corresponding eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha} - E \\cdot I) = 0$:\n$$\n(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda - E)(-\\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda - E) - \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-((\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) + E)((\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) - E) - \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-((\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} - E^{2}) - \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nE^{2} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} - \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2} = 0 \\implies E^{2} = (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} + \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}\n$$\nThe quasiparticle energies are the positive eigenvalues, $E_{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} + \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}}$, which matches the expression given in the problem.\n\nThe eigenvectors of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha}$ define the Bogoliubov transformation. Let the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $E_{\\alpha}$ be $\\begin{pmatrix} u_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix}$. The coefficients $u_{\\alpha}$ and $v_{\\alpha}$ are the amplitudes of the Bogoliubov transformation that connects particle operators to quasiparticle operators. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda & \\Delta_{\\alpha} \\\\ \\Delta_{\\alpha} & -(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix} = E_{\\alpha} \\begin{pmatrix} u_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n1. $(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) u_{\\alpha} + \\Delta_{\\alpha} v_{\\alpha} = E_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha}$\n2. $\\Delta_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) v_{\\alpha} = E_{\\alpha} v_{\\alpha}$\n\nTo find the relationship between the coefficients, we can use either equation. Let's rearrange the second equation:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha} = (E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) v_{\\alpha}\n$$\nAnd from the first equation:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\alpha} v_{\\alpha} = (E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda) u_{\\alpha}\n$$\nTo find $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$, we also use the normalization condition for the transformation, $u_{\\alpha}^{2} + v_{\\alpha}^{2} = 1$. Let us equate expressions for the product $\\Delta_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha}v_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) = u_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda)\n$$\nSubstitute $u_{\\alpha}^{2} = 1 - v_{\\alpha}^{2}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) = (1 - v_{\\alpha}^{2})(E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda)\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) = E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda - v_{\\alpha}^{2}(E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda)\n$$\nGroup terms with $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}[(E_{\\alpha} + \\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda) + (E_{\\alpha} - \\epsilon_{\\alpha} + \\lambda)] = E_{\\alpha} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2}[2E_{\\alpha}] = E_{\\alpha} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)\n$$\nSolving for $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$ yields the desired relation:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{E_{\\alpha} - (\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)}{2E_{\\alpha}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda}{E_{\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nThe quantity $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$ is the occupation probability of the canonical single-particle state $\\alpha$ in the HFB (or BCS) vacuum. By substituting the definition of $E_{\\alpha}$, we obtain the full expression in terms of $\\epsilon_{\\alpha}$, $\\lambda$, and $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda}{\\sqrt{(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} + \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}}}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Quasiparticle Blocking in Odd Nuclei**\n\nAn odd-mass nucleus has an odd number of nucleons. In the quasiparticle framework, this system can be described as a single quasiparticle excitation on top of a fully paired even-even core. This is the essence of quasiparticle blocking.\n\nIf we designate the blocked orbital by $b$, the ground state of the odd nucleus is described as $|\\Psi_{\\text{odd}}\\rangle = \\beta_{b}^{\\dagger}|\\Phi_{\\text{even}}\\rangle$, where $|\\Phi_{\\text{even}}\\rangle$ is the HFB vacuum of the even-even core (which may be variationally readjusted) and $\\beta_{b}^{\\dagger}$ is the creation operator for a quasiparticle in state $b$.\n\nThe consequence of blocking is that the orbital $b$ and its time-reversed partner $\\bar{b}$ are excluded from the pairing correlations that define the vacuum.\n\n- **Unblocked Orbitals ($\\alpha \\neq b, \\bar{b}$):** These orbitals continue to participate in pairing. Their behavior is described by the same BCS-like formalism derived in Part 1. They form Cooper pairs, and their occupation probability in the correlated ground state is given by the formula $v_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - (\\epsilon'_{\\alpha} - \\lambda')/E'_{\\alpha})$. The primes indicate that the mean-field energies $\\epsilon'_{\\alpha}$, chemical potential $\\lambda'$, and pairing gaps $\\Delta'_{\\alpha}$ are determined self-consistently for the odd system and may differ slightly from those of the neighbouring even-even nucleus due to the presence of the odd nucleon.\n\n- **Blocked Orbital ($b$):** The blocking of orbital $b$ means the pairing channel $(b, \\bar{b})$ is broken. The occupation number for the state $b$ in the one-quasiparticle state $|\\Psi_{\\text{odd}}\\rangle$ becomes exactly $1$. Correspondingly, the occupation of its time-reversed partner $\\bar{b}$ becomes $0$.\nAt the level of the one-body density matrix $\\rho$ and the pairing tensor $\\kappa$, whose elements in the canonical basis are $\\rho_{\\alpha\\alpha} = v_{\\alpha}^{2}$ and $\\kappa_{\\alpha\\bar{\\alpha}} = -u_{\\alpha}v_{\\alpha}$ for the even-even vacuum, the blocking imposes the following structure for the orbital pair $(b, \\bar{b})$:\n- **Occupation:** The occupation of the blocked orbital is fixed: $\\rho_{bb} = 1$. The occupation of its time-reversed partner is $\\rho_{\\bar{b}\\bar{b}} = 0$.\n- **Pairing Tensor:** Since there is no Cooper pair involving the blocked orbital, its contribution to the pairing tensor vanishes: $\\kappa_{b\\bar{b}} = 0$.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the occupation probability $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$ for an *unblocked* canonical orbital $\\alpha$ with the given parameters:\n- $\\epsilon_{\\alpha} = -7.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$\n- $\\lambda = -8.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$\n- $\\Delta_{\\alpha} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$\n\nFirst, we compute the difference $\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda = (-7.0) - (-8.0) = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\nNext, we compute the quasiparticle energy $E_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nE_{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda)^{2} + \\Delta_{\\alpha}^{2}} = \\sqrt{(1.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^{2} + (1.2\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{1.0 + 1.44}\\,\\mathrm{MeV} = \\sqrt{2.44}\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\nNow, we use the derived formula for $v_{\\alpha}^{2}$:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\alpha} - \\lambda}{E_{\\alpha}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\sqrt{2.44}\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}\\right)\n$$\nThe value is dimensionless, as expected for a probability.\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1.0}{\\sqrt{2.44}}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1.0}{1.5620499}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (1 - 0.6401844) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.3598156) \\approx 0.1799078\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nv_{\\alpha}^{2} \\approx 0.1799\n$$",

It is a well-formulated question about standard practices in computational nuclear theory. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of Principles\n\nA blocked HFB calculation for an odd nucleus is an iterative, self-consistent procedure. At each iteration, $k$, one solves the HFB equation for a given set of densities $(\\rho^{(k-1)}, \\kappa^{(k-1)})$ to obtain a new set of quasiparticle states and energies. A specific quasiparticle state must be chosen for blocking, which defines the new densities $(\\rho^{(k)}, \\kappa^{(k)})$ for the next iteration. This process is repeated until a fixed point is reached.\n\n**1. Convergence Criteria:**\nThe goal of the self-consistent-field (SCF) iteration is to find a stationary solution of the energy functional $E[\\rho, \\kappa]$ under the imposed constraints. This stationary point, or fixed point, is achieved when the input densities and fields of a given iteration produce output densities that are identical (within a numerical tolerance). Therefore, convergence criteria must monitor the stability of the fundamental quantities.\n- The total energy $E$ is a key global observable. A necessary condition for convergence is that the energy difference between successive iterations, $|E^{(k)} - E^{(k-1)}|$, becomes negligible.\n- The densities $\\rho$ and $\\kappa$, which are combined into the generalized density matrix $\\mathcal{R}$, define the state of the system completely at the mean-field level. The most robust convergence criterion is the stabilization of this density matrix. This is typically measured by a matrix norm of the difference, e.g., the Frobenius norm $\\|\\mathcal{R}^{(k)} - \\mathcal{R}^{(k-1)}\\|$.\n- The calculation is performed subject to constraints, such as holding the average particle number $\\langle \\hat{N}_\\tau \\rangle$ equal to the desired integer value $N_\\tau$. These constraints must be satisfied to within a specified tolerance at the converged solution.\n\nThese three conditions together—energy stability, density matrix stability, and satisfaction of constraints—provide a comprehensive and reliable test for convergence.\n\n**2. State Tracking at Avoided Crossings:**\nAn avoided crossing occurs when two quasiparticle states with the same quantum numbers approach each other in energy. Due to a non-zero coupling $\\delta(q)$, their energy levels repel, and their wave functions (i.e., the $U, V$ amplitudes) mix strongly and rapidly interchange character as the constraint $q$ is varied. A strategy that simply blocks the \"lowest energy state\" will incorrectly switch from following one diabatic configuration to another.\n\nTo maintain diabatic continuity (i.e., to follow a state based on its intrinsic character rather than its energy ordering), one must use a criterion that is insensitive to energy. The physical character of a quasiparticle state is encoded in its vector of amplitudes, $w_i = \\begin{pmatrix} U_i \\\\ V_i \\end{pmatrix}$. While these vectors rotate rapidly with respect to the constraint $q$ near a crossing, they change smoothly and minimally between successive self-consistency iterations at a *fixed* $q$.\n\nTherefore, the correct strategy is to identify the desired quasiparticle state at iteration $k$ as the one that has the largest similarity to the blocked state from the previous iteration, $k-1$. In a vector space, this similarity is measured by the scalar product (or inner product). The overlap between the quasiparticle state $j$ blocked at iteration $k-1$ and a candidate state $i$ at iteration $k$ is given by the scalar product of their state vectors:\n$$\nO_{ij}^{(k)} = \\left\\langle w_j^{(k-1)} \\middle| w_i^{(k)} \\right\\rangle = \\left(w_j^{(k-1)}\\right)^\\dagger w_i^{(k)} = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\left( U_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} U_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} + V_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} V_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} \\right)\n$$\nTo track the state, one chooses the quasiparticle index $i$ at iteration $k$ that maximizes the absolute value of this overlap, $|O_{ij}^{(k)}|$, with the state $j$ that was blocked at iteration $k-1$. This \"maximum overlap\" criterion ensures that the calculation follows a consistent diabatic path.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Conclude convergence when the change in total energy $|E^{(k)}-E^{(k-1)}|$ is below a threshold $\\epsilon$, the norm $\\|\\mathcal{R}^{(k)}-\\mathcal{R}^{(k-1)}\\|$ is below a tolerance, and particle-number constraints $\\langle \\hat{N}_\\tau\\rangle=N_\\tau$ are satisfied within tolerance; avoid occupation switching by selecting at iteration $k$ the blocked quasiparticle as the one whose $U,V$ amplitudes maximize the overlap with the previously blocked quasiparticle at iteration $k-1$, i.e., maximize $O_{ij}^{(k)}=\\left|\\sum_\\alpha U_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} U_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} + \\sum_\\alpha V_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} V_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*}\\right|$.**\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:** This part correctly lists the three essential components of a robust SCF convergence test: stability of the total energy, stability of the generalized density matrix, and satisfaction of physical constraints. This is the standard procedure.\n- **State Tracking Strategy:** This part describes the maximum overlap method. The provided formula for $O_{ij}^{(k)}$ is $| \\sum_\\alpha U_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} U_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} + \\sum_\\alpha V_{\\alpha i}^{(k)} V_{\\alpha j}^{(k-1)*} |$. This is the absolute value of the scalar product $\\left(w_j^{(k-1)}\\right)^\\dagger w_i^{(k)}$, which correctly quantifies the similarity between the quasiparticle state vectors. Maximizing this overlap is the standard and correct method for diabatic state tracking.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately describes both the necessary convergence criteria and the robust state-tracking strategy.\n\n**B. Conclude convergence when all quasiparticle energies $E_i$ stop changing and are in strictly increasing order, and the blocked state’s occupation probability $v_i^2$ equals $1$; avoid occupation switching by always blocking the instantaneous lowest-energy quasiparticle, which by definition tracks the ground configuration through any avoided crossing.**\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:** Monitoring only the quasiparticle energies $E_i$ is insufficient; the densities and wave functions must also stabilize. The condition that energies are in `strictly increasing order` is not a convergence criterion and is false if degeneracies exist. The condition that the blocked state's occupation probability $v_i^2$ equals $1$ is physically incorrect. The HFB formalism does not lead to this simple picture; $v_k^2$ refers to the occupation of a single-particle state $k$ by a pair in the vacuum, not the total occupation of a quasiparticle state.\n- **State Tracking Strategy:** This option proposes blocking the `instantaneous lowest-energy quasiparticle`. The problem statement itself correctly identifies this as a naive and flawed approach that fails at avoided crossings.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Both the convergence criteria and the state-tracking method are either incomplete, physically incorrect, or known to be problematic.\n\n**C. Conclude convergence when the functional derivatives $\\delta E/\\delta \\rho$ and $\\delta E/\\delta \\kappa$ vanish within tolerance and the generalized density matrix satisfies $\\mathcal{R}^2=\\mathcal{R}$; avoid occupation switching by adding a penalty that maximizes the energy separation $|E_1(q)-E_2(q)|$ near an avoided crossing to keep identities distinct.**\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:** The condition that the functional derivatives of the energy vanish is a formal statement of the variational principle, which is correct in spirit. However, the condition $\\mathcal{R}^2=\\mathcal{R}$ (idempotency) holds for the HFB *vacuum* state (an even-even nucleus), but it does not hold for the generalized density matrix describing a one-quasiparticle excited state, which is the case in a blocked calculation for an odd nucleus.\n- **State Tracking Strategy:** Adding a penalty term to the energy functional to artificially increase level separation is scientifically unsound. It changes the physical problem being solved. The goal is to find solutions for the *actual* Hamiltonian/energy functional, not a modified one. This approach avoids the tracking problem by altering the physics, which is not a valid strategy.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The convergence criteria include an invalid condition, and the state-tracking strategy is physically un-justified.\n\n**D. Conclude convergence when the norm of the gradient of the Routhian with respect to $\\rho$ and $\\kappa$ is below a tolerance and constraints are satisfied; avoid occupation switching by enforcing that the blocked $(U,V)$ state remains orthonormal to its previous-iteration self, which precludes mixing across avoided crossings because orthonormality forbids state identity changes.**\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:** Using the gradient of the a constrained functional (the Routhian in the case of a rotational constraint) is a valid formulation for finding stationary points, so this part is plausible.\n- **State Tracking Strategy:** This part is based on a severe misunderstanding of basic linear algebra. Enforcing orthonormality means forcing the inner product between the state at iteration $k$ and the state at iteration $k-1$ to be zero: $\\langle w^{(k-1)} | w^{(k)} \\rangle = 0$. This is the exact opposite of what is required. For state tracking, we need the vectors to be as parallel as possible, meaning their inner product should be close to $1$ (for normalized vectors). Forcing orthogonality would guarantee that the calculation jumps to a completely different, unrelated state at every single iteration.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The state-tracking strategy is nonsensical and contrary to the required principle of maximizing overlap.",

            "introduction": "A well-known feature of the BCS formalism is that its ground state is not an eigenstate of the particle-number operator, leading to inherent particle-number fluctuations. Quasiparticle blocking, which isolates a single nucleon from the paired condensate, has a direct and quantifiable impact on this fluctuation. This exercise  requires you to first derive the expression for particle-number fluctuation in a standard BCS state and then calculate precisely how this fluctuation changes when a specific quasiparticle is blocked. By completing this practice, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the physical consequences of the blocking procedure, seeing explicitly how it locally restores particle-number certainty and reduces the overall variance in the system.",

            "problem": "Consider a time-reversal invariant even-even nucleus described in the canonical basis of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation, which in the weak-coupling limit reduces to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) picture. In this basis, single-particle states come in time-reversed pairs labeled by an index $\\mu$ and its partner $\\bar{\\mu}$, and the even ground state can be written as a product state over such pairs with amplitudes $u_{\\mu}$ and $v_{\\mu}$ satisfying $u_{\\mu}^{2}+v_{\\mu}^{2}=1$. Let the particle-number operator be $N=\\sum_{i} c_{i}^{\\dagger} c_{i}$, where $c_{i}^{\\dagger}$ and $c_{i}$ are fermionic creation and annihilation operators obeying canonical anticommutation relations, and $i$ runs over all single-particle states.\n\nStarting only from the canonical Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) product structure of the even ground state in this time-reversal paired basis and the definition of the particle-number operator, derive the particle-number fluctuation $\\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle$ in the even case. Then construct the odd system by blocking a single quasiparticle $\\mu$, meaning that the corresponding pair $(\\mu,\\bar{\\mu})$ is removed from the condensate and one particle is placed in state $\\mu$, so that anomalous (pairing) correlations in the blocked pair vanish.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a standard, non-trivial calculation within the canonical Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of nuclear pairing, a well-established model in nuclear structure physics. All necessary components—the BCS state, the particle-number operator, and the blocking prescription—are formally and unambiguously defined. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or vagueness. We may, therefore, proceed with the derivation.\n\nTo maintain clarity, the running index over time-reversed pairs in summations will be denoted by $\\nu$, while the specific blocked pair will be denoted by $\\mu$.\n\nFirst, we derive the particle-number fluctuation for the even-even ground state. The ground state is given by the BCS product state:\n$$|\\Psi_{\\text{even}}\\rangle = \\prod_{\\nu > 0} (u_{\\nu} + v_{\\nu} c_{\\nu}^{\\dagger} c_{\\bar{\\nu}}^{\\dagger}) |0\\rangle$$\nwhere the product runs over a representative set of pairs indexed by $\\nu$, and $|0\\rangle$ is the particle vacuum. The coefficients are real and satisfy $u_{\\nu}^{2} + v_{\\nu}^{2} = 1$ for each pair, ensuring normalization. The particle-number operator is $N = \\sum_{i} c_{i}^{\\dagger} c_{i}$, which can be written as a sum over pairs: $N = \\sum_{\\nu > 0} N_{\\nu}$, where $N_{\\nu} = c_{\\nu}^{\\dagger} c_{\\nu} + c_{\\bar{\\nu}}^{\\dagger} c_{\\bar{\\nu}}$.\n\nThe particle-number fluctuation is defined as $\\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle = \\langle N^2 \\rangle - \\langle N \\rangle^2$. Due to the product structure of $|\\Psi_{\\text{even}}\\rangle$, operators corresponding to different pairs $(\\nu \\neq \\eta)$ act on independent subspaces. Consequently, the expectation value of a product of such operators factorizes, e.g., $\\langle N_{\\nu} N_{\\eta} \\rangle = \\langle N_{\\nu} \\rangle \\langle N_{\\eta} \\rangle$ for $\\nu \\neq \\eta$. This implies that the total fluctuation is the sum of the fluctuations for each pair: $\\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle = \\sum_{\\nu > 0} \\langle (\\Delta N_{\\nu})^{2} \\rangle$.\n\nLet's compute the fluctuation for a single pair $\\nu$. The state for this pair can be written as $|\\phi_{\\nu}\\rangle = (u_{\\nu} + v_{\\nu} c_{\\nu}^{\\dagger} c_{\\bar{\\nu}}^{\\dagger})|0\\rangle_{\\nu}$, where $|0\\rangle_{\\nu}$ is the vacuum for the subspace of pair $\\nu$. The state $|\\phi_{\\nu}\\rangle$ is a superposition of a state with $0$ particles (with probability amplitude $u_{\\nu}$) and a state with $2$ particles (with probability amplitude $v_{\\nu}$).\n\nThe expectation value of the number of particles in pair $\\nu$ is:\n$$\\langle N_{\\nu} \\rangle = \\langle \\phi_{\\nu} | N_{\\nu} | \\phi_{\\nu} \\rangle = \\langle 0 |_{\\nu} (u_{\\nu} + v_{\\nu}c_{\\bar{\\nu}}c_{\\nu}) (c_{\\nu}^{\\dagger}c_{\\nu} + c_{\\bar{\\nu}}^{\\dagger}c_{\\bar{\\nu}}) (u_{\\nu} + v_{\\nu}c_{\\nu}^{\\dagger}c_{\\bar{\\nu}}^{\\dagger}) |0\\rangle_{\\nu}$$\nThe operator $N_{\\nu}$ gives $0$ when acting on the $0$-particle component and $2$ when acting on the $2$-particle component.\n$$\\langle N_{\\nu} \\rangle = u_{\\nu}^2 \\cdot 0 + v_{\\nu}^2 \\cdot 2 = 2v_{\\nu}^2$$\n\nNext, we compute the expectation value of $N_{\\nu}^2$:\n$$\\langle N_{\\nu}^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\phi_{\\nu} | N_{\\nu}^2 | \\phi_{\\nu} \\rangle$$\nAgain, $N_{\\nu}^2$ gives $0^2=0$ for the $0$-particle component and $2^2=4$ for the $2$-particle component.\n$$\\langle N_{\\nu}^2 \\rangle = u_{\\nu}^2 \\cdot 0 + v_{\\nu}^2 \\cdot 4 = 4v_{\\nu}^2$$\n\nThe fluctuation for pair $\\nu$ is:\n$$\\langle (\\Delta N_{\\nu})^{2} \\rangle = \\langle N_{\\nu}^2 \\rangle - \\langle N_{\\nu} \\rangle^2 = 4v_{\\nu}^2 - (2v_{\\nu}^2)^2 = 4v_{\\nu}^2(1 - v_{\\nu}^2)$$\nUsing the normalization condition $u_{\\nu}^2 + v_{\\nu}^2 = 1$, we get:\n$$\\langle (\\Delta N_{\\nu})^{2} \\rangle = 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2$$\n\nThe total particle-number fluctuation in the even ground state is the sum over all pairs:\n$$\\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle_{\\text{even}} = \\sum_{\\nu > 0} \\langle (\\Delta N_{\\nu})^{2} \\rangle = \\sum_{\\nu > 0} 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we consider the odd system formed by blocking the pair $\\mu$. The state of the system is now:\n$$|\\Psi_{\\text{odd},\\mu}\\rangle = c_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} \\left( \\prod_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} (u_{\\nu} + v_{\\nu} c_{\\nu}^{\\dagger} c_{\\bar{\\nu}}^{\\dagger}) \\right) |0\\rangle$$\nThis state is a product of the state for the blocked pair, $|\\psi_{\\mu}\\rangle = c_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}|0\\rangle_{\\mu}$, and the BCS states for all other pairs, $|\\phi_{\\nu}\\rangle$ for $\\nu \\neq \\mu$. The total number operator is $N = N_{\\mu} + \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} N_{\\nu}$.\n\nThe particle-number fluctuation in this odd system, $\\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle_{\\text{odd}}$, is the sum of fluctuations from each independent subsystem:\n$$\\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle_{\\text{odd}} = \\langle (\\Delta N_{\\mu})^{2} \\rangle_{\\text{odd}} + \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} \\langle (\\Delta N_{\\nu})^{2} \\rangle$$\nFor the blocked pair $\\mu$, the state is $|\\psi_{\\mu}\\rangle = c_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}|0\\rangle_{\\mu}$. This is an eigenstate of the number operator $N_{\\mu} = c_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}c_{\\mu} + c_{\\bar{\\mu}}^{\\dagger}c_{\\bar{\\mu}}$ with a definite eigenvalue of $1$. The number of particles in this pair is fixed. Therefore, the fluctuation for this blocked pair is zero:\n$$\\langle N_{\\mu} \\rangle_{\\text{odd}} = 1; \\quad \\langle N_{\\mu}^2 \\rangle_{\\text{odd}} = 1^2 = 1$$\n$$\\langle (\\Delta N_{\\mu})^{2} \\rangle_{\\text{odd}} = \\langle N_{\\mu}^2 \\rangle_{\\text{odd}} - (\\langle N_{\\mu} \\rangle_{\\text{odd}})^2 = 1 - 1^2 = 0$$\nFor the unblocked pairs ($\\nu \\neq \\mu$), the state and thus the fluctuation calculation remain identical to the even case, i.e., $\\langle (\\Delta N_{\\nu})^{2} \\rangle = 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2$.\n\nThe total fluctuation in the odd system is the sum over only the unblocked pairs:\n$$\\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle_{\\text{odd}} = 0 + \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2 = \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2$$\n\nFinally, we compute the change in the particle-number fluctuation due to blocking:\n$$\\Delta \\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle = \\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle_{\\text{odd}} - \\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle_{\\text{even}}$$\n$$\\Delta \\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle = \\left(\\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{\\nu > 0} 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2\\right)$$\nThe sum over all pairs $\\nu > 0$ can be split into the term for $\\mu$ and the sum over all other pairs: $\\sum_{\\nu > 0} (\\dots) = (\\dots)_{\\mu} + \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} (\\dots)$.\n$$\\Delta \\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle = \\left(\\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2\\right) - \\left(4u_{\\mu}^2 v_{\\mu}^2 + \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu, \\nu > 0} 4u_{\\nu}^2 v_{\\nu}^2\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\langle (\\Delta N)^{2} \\rangle = -4u_{\\mu}^2 v_{\\mu}^2$$\nThis is the second required expression. The blocking of a pair removes its contribution to the total particle-number variance, which is physically intuitive.",
