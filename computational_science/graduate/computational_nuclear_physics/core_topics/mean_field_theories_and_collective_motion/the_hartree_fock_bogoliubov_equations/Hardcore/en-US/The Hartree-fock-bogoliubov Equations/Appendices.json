You are given a set of three single-particle orbitals, each understood to represent a time-reversed pair, with mean-field energies relative to the laboratory zero as\n$$e_{1} = -9.2\\,\\text{MeV},\\quad e_{2} = -8.3\\,\\text{MeV},\\quad e_{3} = -7.4\\,\\text{MeV}.$$\nThe chemical potential is\n$$\\lambda = -8.0\\,\\text{MeV},$$\nand the pairing gap is uniform,\n$$\\Delta = 1.2\\,\\text{MeV}.$$\n\nStarting from the Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov variational principle and the canonical-basis assumption that only time-reversed partners are coupled in the anomalous channel, derive the quasiparticle amplitudes for the third orbital, denoted by $U_{3}$ and $V_{3}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle amplitudes, $U_3$ and $V_3$, for a specific single-particle orbital within the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) limit of the Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov (HFB) theory, and the subsequent calculation of the normalization quantity $U_3^2 + V_3^2$.\n\nThe HFB theory describes the nuclear ground state as a vacuum of quasiparticles, which are linear combinations of particle and hole creation and annihilation operators. The transformation from the particle basis $\\{c_k^\\dagger, c_k\\}$ to the quasiparticle basis $\\{b_k^\\dagger, b_k\\}$ is the Bogoliubov transformation. The variational principle applied to the energy functional leads to the HFB equation, which is an eigenvalue problem for the quasiparticle energies and amplitudes. In matrix form, it is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} h-\\lambda I  \\Delta \\\\ -\\Delta^\\dagger  -(h-\\lambda I)^* \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} U_k \\\\ V_k \\end{pmatrix} = E_k \\begin{pmatrix} U_k \\\\ V_k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $h$ is the single-particle mean-field Hamiltonian, $\\Delta$ is the pairing field, $\\lambda$ is the chemical potential, $I$ is the identity matrix, and $E_k$ is the energy of the $k$-th quasiparticle. The columns $(U_k, V_k)^T$ are the quasiparticle amplitude vectors for the eigenstate $k$.\n\nThe problem specifies a canonical basis in which the mean-field Hamiltonian $h$ is diagonal, with eigenvalues $e_k$. In this basis, the problem also states that time-reversed partners, denoted by $k$ and $\\bar{k}$, form independent two-dimensional pairing subspaces. This is the essence of the BCS approximation. The full HFB matrix becomes block-diagonal, with a $2 \\times 2$ block for each $(k, \\bar{k})$ pair. We are concerned with the third orbital, so we focus on the subspace spanned by the states $|3\\rangle$ and $|\\bar{3}\\rangle$.\n\nThe relevant single-particle Hamiltonian matrix entries are $(h-\\lambda I)_{3,3} = e_3 - \\lambda$ and $(h-\\lambda I)_{\\bar{3},\\bar{3}} = e_{\\bar{3}} - \\lambda$. Due to time-reversal symmetry, $e_{\\bar{3}} = e_3$. The pairing field $\\Delta$ is assumed to connect only time-reversed partners, thus the only non-zero element in this block is $\\Delta_{3\\bar{3}}$, which we denote as $\\Delta$. The problem specifies a uniform and real pairing gap, so we set $\\Delta_{3\\bar{3}} = \\Delta = 1.2\\,\\text{MeV}$.\n\nThe HFB equation for the pair of states $(3, \\bar{3})$ reduces to the diagonalization of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix. The operators are conventionally ordered as $(c_3^\\dagger, c_{\\bar{3}})$. The corresponding HFB matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} e_3 - \\lambda  \\Delta \\\\ -\\Delta  -(e_3 - \\lambda) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_3  \\Delta \\\\ -\\Delta  -\\epsilon_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere we define the shifted single-particle energy $\\epsilon_3 = e_3 - \\lambda$. The quasiparticle amplitudes $(U_3, V_3)$ for the positive-energy solution form the eigenvector with eigenvalue $E_3 > 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_3  \\Delta \\\\ -\\Delta  -\\epsilon_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} U_3 \\\\ V_3 \\end{pmatrix} = E_3 \\begin{pmatrix} U_3 \\\\ V_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the explicit diagonalization required by the problem statement. The eigenvalues $E_3$ are found by solving the characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathcal{H}_3 - E_3 I) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_3 - E_3  \\Delta \\\\ -\\Delta  -\\epsilon_3 - E_3 \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\epsilon_3 - E_3)(-\\epsilon_3 - E_3) - (\\Delta)(-\\Delta) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-(E_3^2 - \\epsilon_3^2) + \\Delta^2 = 0 \\implies E_3^2 = \\epsilon_3^2 + \\Delta^2\n$$\nThe positive quasiparticle energy is thus $E_3 = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_3^2 + \\Delta^2}$.\n\nNext, we find the eigenvector $(U_3, V_3)^T$. From the first row of the matrix equation:\n$$\n(\\epsilon_3 - E_3)U_3 + \\Delta V_3 = 0 \\implies V_3 = -\\frac{\\epsilon_3 - E_3}{\\Delta} U_3 = \\frac{E_3 - \\epsilon_3}{\\Delta} U_3\n$$\nThe Bogoliubov transformation must preserve the fermionic character of the operators, meaning the quasiparticle operators must satisfy canonical anticommutation relations. This imposes a normalization condition on the amplitudes:\n$$\nU_3^2 + V_3^2 = 1\n$$\nThis is the constraint mentioned in the problem. We substitute the expression for $V_3$ into this normalization condition:\n$$\nU_3^2 + \\left(\\frac{E_3 - \\epsilon_3}{\\Delta}\\right)^2 U_3^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\nU_3^2 \\left[ 1 + \\frac{(E_3 - \\epsilon_3)^2}{\\Delta^2} \\right] = 1\n$$\n$$\nU_3^2 \\left[ \\frac{\\Delta^2 + E_3^2 - 2E_3\\epsilon_3 + \\epsilon_3^2}{\\Delta^2} \\right] = 1\n$$\nUsing the relation $E_3^2 = \\epsilon_3^2 + \\Delta^2$, the term in the numerator becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta^2 + E_3^2 - 2E_3\\epsilon_3 + \\epsilon_3^2 = (\\epsilon_3^2 + \\Delta^2) + E_3^2 - 2E_3\\epsilon_3 = E_3^2 + E_3^2 - 2E_3\\epsilon_3 = 2E_3^2 - 2E_3\\epsilon_3 = 2E_3(E_3 - \\epsilon_3)\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\nU_3^2 \\left[ \\frac{2E_3(E_3 - \\epsilon_3)}{\\Delta^2} \\right] = 1 \\implies U_3^2 = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2E_3(E_3 - \\epsilon_3)}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $(E_3 + \\epsilon_3)$:\n$$\nU_3^2 = \\frac{\\Delta^2(E_3 + \\epsilon_3)}{2E_3(E_3 - \\epsilon_3)(E_3 + \\epsilon_3)} = \\frac{\\Delta^2(E_3 + \\epsilon_3)}{2E_3(E_3^2 - \\epsilon_3^2)}\n$$\nSince $E_3^2 - \\epsilon_3^2 = \\Delta^2$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nU_3^2 = \\frac{\\Delta^2(E_3 + \\epsilon_3)}{2E_3\\Delta^2} = \\frac{E_3 + \\epsilon_3}{2E_3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{E_3} \\right)\n$$\nFrom the normalization condition, we can find $V_3^2$:\n$$\nV_3^2 = 1 - U_3^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{E_3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{2E_3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{E_3} \\right)\n$$\nThese are the general expressions for the quasiparticle amplitudes in the BCS approximation.\n\nNow, we construct $U_3$ and $V_3$ for the given numerical inputs. Note that the energies $e_1$ and $e_2$ are not relevant for this calculation.\nGiven:\n$e_3 = -7.4\\,\\text{MeV}$\n$\\lambda = -8.0\\,\\text{MeV}$\n$\\Delta = 1.2\\,\\text{MeV}$\n\nFirst, we compute $\\epsilon_3$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_3 = e_3 - \\lambda = (-7.4\\,\\text{MeV}) - (-8.0\\,\\text{MeV}) = 0.6\\,\\text{MeV}\n$$\nNext, we compute the quasiparticle energy $E_3$:\n$$\nE_3 = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_3^2 + \\Delta^2} = \\sqrt{(0.6\\,\\text{MeV})^2 + (1.2\\,\\text{MeV})^2} = \\sqrt{0.36 + 1.44}\\,\\text{MeV} = \\sqrt{1.8}\\,\\text{MeV}\n$$\nWe can choose the amplitudes $U_3$ and $V_3$ to be real and positive, which is a common phase convention. This leads to the expressions:\n$$\nU_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{E_3} \\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{0.6}{\\sqrt{1.8}} \\right)}\n$$\n$$\nV_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{E_3} \\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{0.6}{\\sqrt{1.8}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe ratio can be simplified: $\\frac{0.6}{\\sqrt{1.8}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.36}}{\\sqrt{1.8}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.36}{1.8}} = \\sqrt{0.2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nThus, the amplitudes are:\n$$\nU_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)}\n$$\n$$\nV_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the computation of the normalization quantity $U_3^2 + V_3^2$. Using the derived expressions for the squared amplitudes:\n$$\nU_3^2 + V_3^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{E_3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{E_3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nU_3^2 + V_3^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_3}{2E_3} - \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{2E_3}\\right) = 1 + 0 = 1\n$$\nThis result is an algebraic identity stemming from the normalization condition imposed on the Bogoliubov transformation. It holds true regardless of the specific numerical values of $e_3$, $\\lambda$, and $\\Delta$, provided $\\Delta \\neq 0$. The calculation with the specific numerical values confirms this fundamental property. The normalization of the Bogoliubov transformation vectors $(U_k, V_k)$ to unity is a direct consequence of the preservation of fermionic anticommutation relations, a cornerstone of the theory.",

Number Equation)}\n$$\n$$\n1 = G \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\frac{w_i(\\mu, \\Delta)}{2 \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)^2 + \\Delta^2}} \\quad \\text{(2. Gap Equation)}\n$$\nThe regulator weights $w_i$ themselves can depend on $\\mu$ and, in one case, on $\\Delta$. This structure suggests a nested iterative solution. We can structure the problem as finding the root of the gap equation for $\\Delta$, where for each trial value of $\\Delta$, we must first find the corresponding $\\mu$ that satisfies the number equation.\n\nLet us define a residual function for the gap equation:\n$$\nf(\\Delta) = G \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\frac{w_i(\\mu(\\Delta), \\Delta)}{2 \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_i - \\mu(\\Delta))^2 + \\Delta^2}} - 1\n$$\nOur goal is to find $\\Delta \\ge 0$ such that $f(\\Delta) = 0$. The evaluation of $f(\\Delta)$ for any given $\\Delta$ requires the value of $\\mu(\\Delta)$, which is the chemical potential that satisfies the number equation for that specific $\\Delta$.\n\nTo find $\\mu(\\Delta)$, we define a residual function for the number equation at a fixed $\\Delta$:\n$$\ng(\\mu; \\Delta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_i - \\mu}{\\sqrt{(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)^2 + \\Delta^2}}\\right) - N\n$$\nFor a fixed $\\Delta > 0$, the function $g(\\mu; \\Delta)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\mu$, making it suitable for a stable root-finding algorithm like the bisection or Brent's method.\n\nThe overall numerical algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the model parameters: $G=0.17$, $N=100$, and the single-particle spectrum $\\epsilon_i$.\n2.  For each regulator case, define the gap residual function, $f(\\Delta)$.\n3.  The evaluation of $f(\\Delta)$ for a given $\\Delta \\ge 0$ involves solving an inner-loop sub-problem: find the root $\\mu^*$ of $g(\\mu; \\Delta) = 0$ using a numerical root-finder.\n4.  Before solving for a non-trivial gap, check if one exists. A non-trivial solution $\\Delta > 0$ exists if the gap equation residual is positive in the limit $\\Delta \\to 0^+$. If $f(\\Delta \\to 0^+) \\le 0$, the solution is the trivial one, $\\Delta = 0$.\n5.  If a non-trivial solution exists, solve $f(\\Delta) = 0$ for $\\Delta > 0$ using a root-finder with the required tolerance.\n\nThis nested root-finding approach provides a robust method to solve the coupled self-consistent equations. The implementation of the regulators $w_i$ follows directly from their definitions in the problem statement. The final list of computed gaps for each test case is then formatted as specified.",
