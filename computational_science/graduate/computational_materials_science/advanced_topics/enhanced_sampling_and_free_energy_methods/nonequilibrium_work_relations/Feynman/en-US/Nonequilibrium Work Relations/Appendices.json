            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional overdamped Brownian particle of mass $m$ in contact with a thermal reservoir at fixed temperature $T$. The particle is confined by a harmonic potential $U(x;k) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$ whose stiffness parameter $k$ is externally controlled and time-dependent according to a piecewise protocol. The system is initially prepared in canonical equilibrium at parameter $k_{0}$ and temperature $T$. The protocol consists of the following segments:\n\n1. A sudden parameter jump at time $t=0$ from $k_{0}$ to $k_{1}$, so that the microstate $x$ does not change during the jump, followed by complete relaxation at fixed $k=k_{1}$ back to canonical equilibrium with the reservoir.\n\n2.

Express the final free energy difference in Joules. The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical values are required and no rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and found to be valid. It describes a sequence of thermodynamic processes applied to an overdamped Brownian particle in a harmonic potential. The language, while containing a minor ambiguity in the time variable for different stages, is consistent with a sequential protocol involving a parameter jump, a relaxation period, a continuous parameter change, and a final relaxation period. This interpretation renders all parts of the problem well-posed and solvable using established principles of statistical mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics.\n\nThe system is a one-dimensional particle in a harmonic potential $U(x;k) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2$. The particle is in contact with a heat bath at a constant temperature $T$. For such a system in canonical equilibrium, the equipartition theorem states that the average potential energy is $\\langle U \\rangle_{eq} = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. From this, we can find the mean squared displacement: $\\langle \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T$, which implies $\\langle x^2 \\rangle_{eq} = \\frac{k_B T}{k}$.\n\nThe protocol is interpreted as a sequence:\n1.  The system is initially in equilibrium with the potential parameter set to $k_0$.\n2.  At time $t=0$, the parameter is instantaneously changed from $k_0$ to $k_1$. Work is performed on the system.\n3.  The system then relaxes at a fixed parameter $k=k_1$ until it reaches a new equilibrium state. Heat is exchanged with the reservoir.\n4.  Starting from this equilibrium state at $k_1$, the parameter is continuously varied from $k_1$ to $k_2$ over a time interval of duration $\\tau$. Work is performed on the system.\n5.  Finally, with the parameter fixed at $k_2$, the system relaxes to its final equilibrium state. Heat is exchanged with the reservoir.\n\nThe energy of a microstate $x$ is given by its potential energy $U(x;k)$. The first law of thermodynamics for a single trajectory is $dE = dW + dQ$, where $E=U$. The work $dW$ is associated with the change in the control parameter $k$, $dW = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial k} dk$. The heat $dQ$ is the energy exchanged with the reservoir at a fixed parameter, which can be shown to be $dQ = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} dx$.\n\na) The total work $W_{\\text{tot}}$ is the sum of the work done during the two segments where the parameter $k$ changes. Let the initial position of the particle drawn from the equilibrium distribution at $k_0$ be $x_0$. Let the trajectory of the particle during the continuous protocol be denoted by $x(t)$ for $t$ in the interval of this protocol segment.\n\nThe work done during the sudden jump from $k_0$ to $k_1$ is called $W_{\\text{jump}}$. Since the jump is instantaneous, the particle's position $x_0$ does not change. The work is the change in potential energy due to the parameter change at fixed position:\n$$W_{\\text{jump}} = U(x_0; k_1) - U(x_0; k_0) = \\frac{1}{2} k_1 x_0^2 - \\frac{1}{2} k_0 x_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (k_1 - k_0) x_0^2$$\n\nThe work done during the continuous protocol from $k_1$ to $k_2$ is called $W_{\\text{prot}}$. This work is given by integrating the infinitesimal work $dW$ over the protocol duration, which we can take to be $t \\in [0, \\tau]$ after re-zeroing the clock.\n$$W_{\\text{prot}} = \\int_{\\text{protocol}} dW = \\int_0^\\tau \\frac{\\partial U(x(t); k(t))}{\\partial k} \\frac{dk}{dt} dt = \\int_0^\\tau \\frac{1}{2} x(t)^2 \\dot{k}(t) dt$$\nThe total work is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$W_{\\text{tot}} = W_{\\text{jump}} + W_{\\text{prot}} = \\frac{1}{2} (k_1 - k_0) x_0^2 + \\int_0^\\tau \\frac{1}{2} x(t)^2 \\dot{k}(t) dt$$\n\nb) We need to compute the average heat $\\langle Q_{\\text{relax},1} \\rangle$ exchanged during the relaxation at constant parameter $k=k_1$. This process starts immediately after the jump. The initial state for this relaxation process is the particle at position $x_0$ in the potential $U(x; k_1)$. The final state is canonical equilibrium at temperature $T$ and parameter $k_1$.\nDuring relaxation at constant $k$, no work is done ($dk=0$, so $dW=0$). From the first law, the heat exchanged along a trajectory is equal to the change in energy: $Q_{\\text{relax},1} = \\Delta U = U_{\\text{final}} - U_{\\text{initial}}$.\nWe require the average heat, $\\langle Q_{\\text{relax},1} \\rangle = \\langle U_{\\text{final}} \\rangle - \\langle U_{\\text{initial}} \\rangle$.\n\nThe average initial energy, $\\langle U_{\\text{initial}} \\rangle$, is the average of $U(x_0; k_1) = \\frac{1}{2} k_1 x_0^2$, where the average is taken over the initial equilibrium distribution of $x_0$ at parameter $k_0$.\n$$\\langle U_{\\text{initial}} \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} k_1 x_0^2 \\right\\rangle_{k_0} = \\frac{1}{2} k_1 \\langle x_0^2 \\rangle_{k_0}$$\nUsing the equipartition result $\\langle x_0^2 \\rangle_{k_0} = k_B T / k_0$, we get:\n$$\\langle U_{\\text{initial}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_1 \\frac{k_B T}{k_0}$$\n\nThe average final energy, $\\langle U_{\\text{final}} \\rangle$, is the average potential energy in the new equilibrium state with parameter $k_1$. By the equipartition theorem:\n$$\\langle U_{\\text{final}} \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} k_1 x^2 \\right\\rangle_{k_1} = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T$$\n\nThe average heat is therefore:\n$$\\langle Q_{\\text{relax},1} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T - \\frac{1}{2} k_1 \\frac{k_B T}{k_0} = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\left(1 - \\frac{k_1}{k_0}\\right)$$\n\nc) Similarly, for the relaxation at constant $k=k_2$, the average heat exchanged is $\\langle Q_{\\text{relax},2} \\rangle = \\langle U_{\\text{final}} \\rangle - \\langle U_{\\text{initial}} \\rangle$.\nThe initial state for this process is the state of the system at the end of the continuous protocol, which is a particle at position $x_{\\text{end}}$ in the potential $U(x; k_2)$. The problem provides the average squared displacement at this point as $\\langle x^2 \\rangle_{\\text{end}}$.\nThe average initial energy is:\n$$\\langle U_{\\text{initial}} \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} k_2 x_{\\text{end}}^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_2 \\langle x^2 \\rangle_{\\text{end}}$$\nThe final state is equilibrium at parameter $k_2$, so the average final energy is $\\langle U_{\\text{final}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T$.\nThe average heat is:\n$$\\langle Q_{\\text{relax},2} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T - \\frac{1}{2} k_2 \\langle x^2 \\rangle_{\\text{end}}$$\nThis average heat vanishes, $\\langle Q_{\\text{relax},2} \\rangle = 0$, if $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T = \\frac{1}{2} k_2 \\langle x^2 \\rangle_{\\text{end}}$. This condition means that the average potential energy at the end of the continuous driving protocol must be equal to the equilibrium average potential energy for parameter $k_2$. A sufficient condition for this is that the system remains in equilibrium throughout the continuous driving process, which occurs if the protocol is performed quasi-statically (i.e., infinitely slowly, $\\tau \\to \\infty$).\n\nd) The equilibrium free energy difference $\\Delta F$ between the initial state (equilibrium at $k_0$) and the final state (equilibrium at $k_2$) is a state function. It depends only on the initial and final equilibrium states, not on the path taken between them. The non-equilibrium work theorems, such as the Jarzynski equality $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)$, confirm that $\\Delta F$ can in principle be found from any non-equilibrium process connecting the two states. However, the theorems also underscore that the value of $\\Delta F$ is unique and path-independent.\n\nTherefore, we can compute $\\Delta F$ by the most direct method available, which is through the statistical mechanical definition of the Helmholtz free energy, $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$, where $Z$ is the partition function. For a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the partition function is:\n$$Z(k, T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x;k)}{k_B T}\\right) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k x^2}{2 k_B T}\\right) dx$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral, which evaluates to:\n$$Z(k, T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi k_B T}{k}}$$\nThe free energy as a function of $k$ and $T$ is:\n$$F(k, T) = -k_B T \\ln(Z(k, T)) = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi k_B T}{k}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi k_B T}{k}\\right)$$\nThe free energy difference $\\Delta F = F(k_2, T) - F(k_0, T)$ is then:\n$$\\Delta F = -\\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi k_B T}{k_2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi k_B T}{k_0}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta F = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi k_B T}{k_0}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi k_B T}{k_2}\\right) \\right]$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\\Delta F = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi k_B T/k_0}{2 \\pi k_B T/k_2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_2}{k_0}\\right)$$\nThis expression gives the free energy difference in units of energy (Joules in SI units) and is the final answer required.",

We proceed with the solution.\n\nPart (a): Derivation of constraints\n\nThe foundation of non-equilibrium work relations is the principle of microscopic reversibility. For a system evolving under a time-dependent protocol $\\lambda(t)$, the ratio of the probability of observing a forward trajectory $\\Gamma = \\{x(t)\\}_{t=0}^{\\tau}$ to the probability of observing its time-reversal $\\tilde{\\Gamma} = \\{x(\\tau-t)\\}_{t=0}^{\\tau}$ under the time-reversed protocol $\\lambda_R(t) = \\lambda_F(\\tau-t)$ is related to the entropy produced along the forward path.

Let the forward process start from an equilibrium distribution at $\\lambda(0)=0$ with free energy $F(\\lambda=0)$, and the reverse process start from equilibrium at $\\lambda(\\tau)=1$ with free energy $F(\\lambda=1)$. The Crooks fluctuation theorem states the relationship between the probability distributions of the work $W$ performed on the system. For the forward ($P_F(W)$) and reverse ($P_R(W)$) processes, this theorem is:\n$$\n\\frac{P_F(W)}{P_R(-W)} = \\exp(\\beta(W - \\Delta F))\n$$\nHere, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse thermal energy, and $\\Delta F = F(\\lambda=1) - F(\\lambda=0)$ is the equilibrium free energy difference between the final and initial states of the protocol.

A single fast trajectory typically exhibits significant dissipative work, and the estimator based on a single value $W$ is not guaranteed to equal $\\Delta F$. Finite-sample bias and variance are severe in this regime, as the average is dominated by rare, low-work trajectories that are unlikely to be observed with minimal sampling. Thus, the claim that a single trajectory is guaranteed to be exact is false. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: The free energy depends on the Hamiltonian and the ensemble. Removing the membrane changes intermolecular interactions, dielectric environment, steric constraints, and therefore the Hamiltonian that defines the statistical mechanics of the system. Work measured in the membrane-free system pertains to that altered system, not to the ligand unbinding from a membrane-embedded receptor. Interpreting it as the membrane-embedded unbinding free energy is a category error. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption D: The definition of a reaction coordinate requires a consistent relation to the molecular frame. If the receptor is free to translate and rotate, the laboratory-frame $z$-directed pulling can induce reorientation, and the measured work may include contributions from rotational and translational motions unrelated to progress along a well-defined unbinding coordinate. This mixes degrees of freedom and makes the coordinate ambiguous, impairing interpretation and reproducibility. Applying appropriate restraints to define the molecular frame is often necessary to define the coordinate. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption E: A potential of mean force (PMF) along a geometric coordinate is not, by itself, the standard-state binding free energy. Connecting a PMF to a standard binding free energy requires accounting for restraint biases, volume or concentration conventions, and potentially integrating over orientational and positional degrees of freedom orthogonal to the coordinate. Therefore, claiming direct equality without corrections is incorrect. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption F: Non-equilibrium thermodynamics dictates that faster pulling and stiffer springs generally increase dissipative work and hysteresis, moving the process further from reversible behavior. This increases the bias and variance of exponential work estimators and can compromise convergence unless one collects an ensemble of trajectories and uses appropriate analysis. Hence, this is a valid critique of the protocol as described. Verdict — Correct.\n\nIn summary, options A, C, D, and F articulate fundamental and valid concerns grounded in statistical mechanics and physical realism, whereas options B and E are incorrect statements of principle.",
