            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All provided data and assumptions are consistent with the fundamental principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and standard experimental practices. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the flip angle $\\theta$ of a nuclear spin, the duration $\\tau_p$ of an applied radiofrequency (RF) pulse, and the strength of that RF field. In the rotating frame of reference, for an on-resonance RF pulse, the nuclear magnetization vector precesses about the axis of the RF field $\\vec{B}_1$. This precession is called nutation.\n\nThe angular frequency of this nutation, $\\omega_1$, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the RF field, $B_1$, via the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ of the nucleus:\n$$ \\omega_1 = \\gamma B_1 $$\nThe total angle of rotation, or flip angle $\\theta$, accumulated over a pulse duration $\\tau_p$ is given by:\n$$ \\theta = \\omega_1 \\tau_p $$\nThe problem specifies the transverse nutation frequency in terms of cyclic frequency, $\\nu_1$, rather than angular frequency, $\\omega_1$. The relationship between them is:\n$$ \\omega_1 = 2\\pi\\nu_1 $$\nSubstituting this into the flip angle equation yields the fundamental relation for this problem:\n$$ \\theta = 2\\pi\\nu_1\\tau_p $$\nThe problem provides the following givens:\n1.  The pulse is a $90^{\\circ}$ pulse. In the standard scientific unit of radians, this flip angle is $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n2.  The pulse duration is $\\tau_p = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nWe can now solve for the transverse nutation frequency $\\nu_1$:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2\\pi\\nu_1 \\tau_p $$\nDividing both sides by $2\\pi$ and rearranging for $\\nu_1$:\n$$ \\nu_1 = \\frac{1}{4\\tau_p} $$\nSubstituting the given value for $\\tau_p$:\n$$ \\nu_1 = \\frac{1}{4 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{1}{40 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{10^6}{40}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\n$$ \\nu_1 = 25000\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\nThe problem requires this frequency to be expressed in kilohertz (kHz). Since $1\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$ \\nu_1 = 25\\,\\mathrm{kHz} $$\nThe problem requires this result to be reported to four significant figures. Thus, we write:\n$$ \\nu_1 = 25.00\\,\\mathrm{kHz} $$\nThis value, $\\nu_1$, represents the strength of the RF field in frequency units. For effective broadband decoupling, this RF field strength must be significantly larger than the range of frequencies (the bandwidth) it is intended to cover.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the decoupling margin factor, $m$, which is defined as:\n$$ m = \\frac{\\nu_1}{\\Delta\\nu} $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\nu$ is the required broadband decoupling bandwidth, given as $\\Delta\\nu = 8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$.\nSubstituting the values for $\\nu_1$ and $\\Delta\\nu$:\n$$ m = \\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{kHz}}{8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}} = \\frac{25}{8} $$\n$$ m = 3.125 $$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity. The result $3.125$ has exactly four significant figures, so it meets the specified rounding requirement without modification.\n\nThe final two results are $\\nu_1 = 25.00\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $m = 3.125$.",

There are no contradictions.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The experimental parameters are physically realistic and commonly encountered in practice.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed. The definition and data lead to a unique and stable solution.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: While the calculation is elementary, it assesses a core conceptual understanding of experimental parameters in NMR, which is a valid pedagogical objective. The requirement for a qualitative discussion on physical implications adds substantive depth.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The calculation is arithmetically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the decoupling duty cycle and a discussion of its implications. The duty cycle, denoted as $D$, is explicitly defined as the fraction of time the decoupling field is active over the total duration of a single, repeating cycle of the experiment.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total time of one repeating cycle, $T_{\\text{total}}$. A single scan in this experiment consists of the acquisition period, $t_{\\text{acq}}$, and the subsequent recycle delay, $t_{\\text{R}}$. It is stated that all other events have negligible duration. Therefore, the total time for one cycle is the sum of these two periods:\n$$T_{\\text{total}} = t_{\\text{acq}} + t_{\\text{R}}$$\n\nNext, we identify the duration for which the decoupling field is active, $T_{\\text{on}}$. The problem states that the decoupling is applied continuously only during the acquisition period. Thus:\n$$T_{\\text{on}} = t_{\\text{acq}}$$\n\nUsing the provided definition, the duty cycle $D$ is the ratio of $T_{\\text{on}}$ to $T_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$D = \\frac{T_{\\text{on}}}{T_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{t_{\\text{acq}}}{t_{\\text{acq}} + t_{\\text{R}}}$$\n\nWe are given the values $t_{\\text{acq}} = 2\\,\\text{s}$ and $t_{\\text{R}} = 4\\,\\text{s}$. Substituting these into the expression for $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{2\\,\\text{s}}{2\\,\\text{s} + 4\\,\\text{s}} = \\frac{2\\,\\text{s}}{6\\,\\text{s}} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{3} = 0.333333\\ldots \\approx 0.3333$$\n\nNow, for the qualitative discussion on the implications for RF power deposition and probe heating. Let $P_{\\text{inst}}$ be the instantaneous power delivered by the RF amplifier to the probe when the decoupling field is on. This power is dissipated in the probe coil and the sample, primarily as heat.\n\nThe total energy deposited into the probe during one cycle, $E_{\\text{cycle}}$, is the product of the instantaneous power and the duration for which it is applied:\n$$E_{\\text{cycle}} = P_{\\text{inst}} \\times T_{\\text{on}} = P_{\\text{inst}} \\times t_{\\text{acq}}$$\n\nThe average power, $P_{\\text{avg}}$, deposited over the full duration of the cycle is this energy divided by the total cycle time, $T_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{cycle}}}{T_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{inst}} \\times t_{\\text{acq}}}{t_{\\text{acq}} + t_{\\text{R}}}$$\n\nBy recognizing that the fraction in this expression is the duty cycle $D$, we arrive at a fundamental relationship:\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = P_{\\text{inst}} \\times D$$\n\nThis equation demonstrates that the average power deposited into the NMR probe, and thus the rate of probe and sample heating, is directly proportional to the duty cycle. For a given instantaneous decoupling power $P_{\\text{inst}}$ (which is determined by the required decoupling field strength), a higher duty cycle results in a greater average power dissipation. In this specific case, the average power is approximately one-third ($D \\approx 0.3333$) of the instantaneous power.\n\nSignificant heating can have deleterious effects on an NMR experiment, including:\n1.  **Thermal Gradients**: Non-uniform heating can create temperature gradients across the sample, leading to broadening of the NMR resonances.\n2.  **Chemical Shift Drift**: As temperature changes, the chemical shifts of resonances can drift over the course of a long experiment, degrading the quality of the final summed spectrum.\n3.  **Sample Degradation**: For thermally sensitive biological or chemical samples, excessive heating can cause denaturation or decomposition.\n4.  **Probe Damage**: In extreme cases, very high average power can damage the NMR probe electronics.\n\nTherefore, the duty cycle is a critical parameter that must be managed in NMR experiments, especially those employing high-power continuous-wave decoupling. Experimentalists may need to increase the recycle delay $t_{\\text{R}}$ (which decreases the duty cycle) or use more advanced, power-efficient decoupling schemes to mitigate heating effects.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. All provided data and foundational principles are consistent with established theories of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\nThe central task is to evaluate statements regarding a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR experiment conducted with continuous broadband proton decoupling. The signal intensity, $I$, for each carbon nucleus under these conditions is influenced by two primary factors: the recovery of longitudinal magnetization during the recycle delay, $d$, and the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) enhancement, $E$. For an experiment using a $90^\\circ$ flip angle, the longitudinal magnetization recovers from zero towards its equilibrium value, $M_0$. After a delay $d$, the magnetization available for detection is $M_z(d) = M_0(1 - e^{-d/T_1})$, where $T_1$ is the spin-lattice relaxation time.\n\nContinuous proton irradiation saturates the proton transitions, leading to a non-equilibrium population distribution of the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ spin states, which alters the equilibrium magnetization $M_0$. This is the NOE. The observed signal intensity is thus proportional to the product of the NOE factor and the magnetization recovery factor. The problem provides enhancement factors, $E$, which we interpret as the multiplicative factor on the signal intensity, i.e., $I \\propto E \\times I_{no-NOE}$.\n\nTherefore, the relative intensity $S$ of each signal can be calculated as:\n$$S \\propto E \\cdot \\left(1 - e^{-d/T_1}\\right)$$\nWe are given $d = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$ and specific values for $T_1$ and $E$ for each of the four carbon environments ($\\mathrm{CH}_3, \\mathrm{CH}_2, \\mathrm{CH}, \\mathrm{C}_q$), which are present in a $1:1:1:1$ stoichiometric ratio.\n\nWe will now evaluate each statement individually.\n\n**A. Even though the quaternary carbon has no directly bonded hydrogen and thus $J_{CH} = 0$ for the one-bond interaction, its $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signal intensity can still be enhanced under proton decoupling by NOE through heteronuclear dipolar cross-relaxation with nearby protons; therefore its integral under these conditions does not reflect stoichiometric carbon count.**\n\nThis statement consists of three connected claims.\n1.  A quaternary carbon, $\\mathrm{C}_q$, by definition, has no directly bonded hydrogens. The one-bond scalar coupling, ${}^1J_{CH}$, is mediated through the bonding electrons between the carbon and hydrogen. In the absence of this bond, ${}^1J_{CH}$ is indeed zero. This part of the statement is correct.\n2.  The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is mediated by the through-space dipolar interaction, not the through-bond scalar interaction. A carbon nucleus can experience an NOE from any proton that is sufficiently close in space, typically within about $5\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$. The problem states the $\\mathrm{C}_q$ is ortho to two aromatic protons, which places them in close spatial proximity. Continuous irradiation of these protons will cause cross-relaxation and hence an NOE enhancement on the $\\mathrm{C}_q$ signal. The problem provides a value of $E(\\mathrm{C}_q) \\approx 1.2$, which represents a $20\\%$ enhancement, confirming this effect occurs. This part of the statement is correct.\n3.  For signal integrals to be quantitative (i.e., directly proportional to the number of nuclei), two conditions must be met: (i) there should be no differential NOE enhancements between different carbons, and (ii) there must be complete relaxation for all nuclei between pulses ($d \\ge 5T_{1,\\text{max}}$). In this experiment, the NOE factors are all different ($3.0, 2.0, 1.5, 1.2$), and the relaxation is incomplete for most carbons since $d=2.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$ while the $T_1$ values range up to $8.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$. Because of these differential effects, the integrals do not reflect the $1:1:1:1$ stoichiometry. This part of the statement, which is the logical conclusion of the previous parts, is correct.\n\nThe entire statement is factually and logically correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Broadband proton decoupling affects only scalar couplings and cannot alter $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signal intensities; hence quaternary carbons remain strictly quantitative while protonated carbons do not.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Broadband proton decoupling has two major consequences:\n1.  It collapses multiplets arising from heteronuclear scalar ($J$) couplings into singlets.\n2.  It leads to the NOE, which alters the signal intensities of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ nuclei that are dipolar-coupled to the irradiated protons.\nThe claim that decoupling \"cannot alter $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signal intensities\" is false. The NOE is a direct and significant consequence that alters signal intensity. The conclusion, \"hence quaternary carbons remain strictly quantitative,\" is based on this false premise and is also incorrect, as established in the analysis of option A. Quaternary carbons are subject to both NOE and incomplete relaxation effects, making them non-quantitative under these conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Using inverse-gated decoupling (decoupler off during the relaxation delay and on only during acquisition) with sufficiently long recycle delays $d \\ge 5 T_1$ suppresses NOE and allows quantitative comparison of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ integrals for both quaternary and protonated carbons.**\n\nThis statement describes the standard experimental procedure for obtaining quantitative $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR spectra.\n1.  **Inverse-gated decoupling**: By keeping the proton decoupler off during the relaxation delay ($d$), the proton spins are not saturated, and the system of spins ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and $^1\\mathrm{H}$) returns to thermal equilibrium. This prevents the buildup of the NOE. The decoupler is switched on only during the acquisition of the FID to collapse the $J$-coupling multiplets. This part of the statement is correct.\n2.  **Sufficiently long recycle delays**: For integrals to be proportional to the number of nuclei, the longitudinal magnetization for all signals must fully recover before each pulse. A recycle delay of $d \\ge 5T_1$ (where $T_1$ is the longest spin-lattice relaxation time in the molecule) ensures that magnetization has recovered to over $99.3\\%$ of its equilibrium value ($1-e^{-5} \\approx 0.9932$).\nCombining these two conditions—suppression of NOE via inverse-gated decoupling and complete relaxation via a long recycle delay—ensures that the measured signal integral for each carbon is directly proportional to its concentration. The statement accurately describes this.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because $J_{CH}$ is absent for the quaternary carbon, its line shape and intensity are identical with and without decoupling; any observed intensity differences in decoupled experiments must arise solely from transverse relaxation ($T_2$), not NOE.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple errors.\n1.  \"its line shape... [is] identical with and without decoupling\": While the large one-bond coupling ${}^1J_{CH}$ is absent, a quaternary carbon typically exhibits small, long-range couplings (${}^2J_{CH}$, ${}^3J_{CH}$, etc.) to nearby protons. These couplings, typically $1-10\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, will split the signal into a multiplet in the absence of decoupling. Broadband decoupling collapses this fine structure into a single, often sharper, line. Therefore, the line shape is not identical.\n2.  \"and intensity are identical with and without decoupling\": As established in the analysis of option A, the quaternary carbon signal is enhanced by the NOE under decoupling. Its intensity is therefore not identical.\n3.  \"any observed intensity differences... must arise solely from transverse relaxation ($T_2$), not NOE\": This is false. Intensity differences are primarily due to the NOE and incomplete $T_1$ relaxation effects. Transverse relaxation time, $T_2$, governs the linewidth of the signal ($\\Delta\\nu_{1/2} = 1/(\\pi T_2)$), not its integrated intensity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Long-range heteronuclear scalar couplings (${}^2J_{CH}$, ${}^3J_{CH}$) in aromatic systems are typically of order $100\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, so decoupling is essential for quaternary carbons mainly to remove these large couplings.**\n\nThis statement is based on a gross factual error regarding the magnitude of coupling constants. One-bond couplings (${}^1J_{CH}$) are large, typically in the range of $125-250\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. Long-range couplings (${}^2J_{CH}$, ${}^3J_{CH}$) are very much smaller, typically on the order of $1-10\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. A value of $100\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ for a long-range coupling is incorrect. While decoupling is useful to collapse the fine structure from these small long-range couplings into a singlet to improve signal-to-noise, the premise that these couplings are \"large\" is false, and this is not the \"main\" reason decoupling is a universally applied technique in routine $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F.
