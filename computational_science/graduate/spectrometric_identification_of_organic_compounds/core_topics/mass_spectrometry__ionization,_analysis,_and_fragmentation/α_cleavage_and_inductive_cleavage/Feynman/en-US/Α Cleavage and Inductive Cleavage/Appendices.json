Under Electron Impact (EI) mass spectrometry at $70~\\mathrm{eV}$, the dominant isotopic contribution is monoisotopic. In EI, the molecular radical cation undergoes bond dissociation, and $\\alpha$ cleavage is defined here as homolytic rupture of the $\\mathrm{C\\!-\\!C}$ bond adjacent to the oxygen, forming a neutral radical and an oxonium-type cation that retains the oxygen and the remainder of the skeleton.

The definition of $\\alpha$ cleavage, while specific to the problem's context, is clear and unambiguous. No flaws or contradictions are found. Therefore, a reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires a series of calculations to determine the products of two possible $\\alpha$-cleavage fragmentation pathways for benzyl neopentyl ether, $\\mathrm{C_{12}H_{18}O}$, and to identify the observed pathway using provided mass spectral data.

This value falls within the experimental range for the intense peak ($121.060$ to $121.070$). This is a clear match.\n- The calculated $m/z$ for benzyl-side cleavage is $101.09664$. This value falls within the experimental range where no peak was observed ($101.092$ to $101.102$). This is also consistent.\n\nThe evidence strongly indicates that the observed $\\alpha$ cleavage occurs on the neopentyl side, leading to the loss of a stable tert-butyl radical and the formation of a resonance-stabilized benzylic oxonium cation, $\\mathrm{C_{8}H_{9}O}^{+}$. The fragment that is not observed corresponds to the cleavage on the benzyl side.\n\nThe problem asks for the $m/z$ of the observed $\\alpha$-cleavage fragment. This is the value we calculated for the neopentyl-side cleavage, which is $121.06534$. This value must be rounded to five significant figures. The first five significant figures are $1$, $2$, $1$, $0$, $6$. The subsequent digit is $5$, so we round the last digit up.\n$$121.06534 \\approx 121.07$$\nThe final reported $m/z$ value is $121.07~\\mathrm{Da}$.",

Consider tert-butyl isopropyl ether, with neutral molecular formula $\\mathrm{C}_{7}\\mathrm{H}_{16}\\mathrm{O}$. In positive-ion Electrospray Ionization (ESI) followed by low-energy Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID), fragmentation adjacent to the oxygen can proceed by $\\alpha$ cleavage (homolytic) or inductive cleavage (heterolytic). Widely accepted gas-phase observations establish that, for protonated ethers, inductive cleavage often dominates and preferentially retains the charge on the fragment that can form the more basic oxonium or protonated alcohol, with the complementary fragment departing as a neutral species. For alcohols, tertiary substitution increases gas-phase basicity relative to secondary substitution.\n\nStarting from these principles, predict which $\\mathrm{C{-}O}$ bond in protonated tert-butyl isopropyl ether will most favor inductive heterolysis with charge retention, and use mass conservation to compute the precise $m/z$ of the charge-retained fragment. Identify the corresponding neutral loss that is consistent with heterolytic cleavage of the complementary side. Assume singly charged ions so that $m/z$ equals ion mass.

            "solution": "The problem asks to predict the major fragmentation product of protonated tert-butyl isopropyl ether under low-energy CID and to calculate its mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$). The problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed, providing all necessary principles and data.\n\nFirst, we identify the structure of the precursor ion. Tert-butyl isopropyl ether, $(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2$, is protonated on the oxygen atom during ESI, forming the precursor ion $[(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O(H)}-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2]^+$. Its neutral formula is $\\mathrm{C}_7\\mathrm{H}_{16}\\mathrm{O}$.\n\nNext, we identify the possible fragmentation pathways. A common pathway for protonated ethers involves an elimination reaction, forming a protonated alcohol and a neutral alkene. There are two such pathways for this ion:\n\n1.  **Pathway 1:** Elimination from the tert-butyl group. This involves the loss of neutral isobutylene ($\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_8$) to form protonated isopropyl alcohol, $[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHOH}_2]^+$.\n    $$[(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O(H)}-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2]^+ \\longrightarrow (\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{C=CH}_2 + [(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{CHOH}_2]^+$$\n2.  **Pathway 2:** Elimination from the isopropyl group. This involves the loss of neutral propene ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_6$) to form protonated tert-butyl alcohol, $[(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{COH}_2]^+$.\n    $$[(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O(H)}-\\mathrm{CH}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2]^+ \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CH}_2\\mathrm{=CHCH}_3 + [(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{COH}_2]^+$$\n\nTo determine the favored pathway, we apply the principle given in the problem: fragmentation \"preferentially retains the charge on the fragment that can form the more basic oxonium or protonated alcohol\". We must compare the gas-phase basicity of the two potential alcohol products: isopropyl alcohol (a secondary alcohol) and tert-butyl alcohol (a tertiary alcohol).\n\nThe problem states: \"For alcohols, tertiary substitution increases gas-phase basicity relative to secondary substitution.\" Therefore, tert-butyl alcohol is more basic than isopropyl alcohol. This increased basicity stabilizes the corresponding protonated ion, $[(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{COH}_2]^+$, more effectively.\n\nConsequently, Pathway 2 is the most favored fragmentation route. This results in the formation of the charged fragment, protonated tert-butyl alcohol, and the neutral loss of propene.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the precise $m/z$ of the favored charge-retained fragment, which is protonated tert-butyl alcohol. The chemical formula for this ion is $[\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_{11}\\mathrm{O}]^+$.\n\nWe use the provided monoisotopic masses: $m_{\\mathrm{C}}=12.000000\\,\\mathrm{amu}$, $m_{\\mathrm{H}}=1.007825\\,\\mathrm{amu}$, and $m_{\\mathrm{O}}=15.994915\\,\\mathrm{amu}$. The mass of an ion is calculated by summing the masses of its constituent atoms.\n\nThe mass ($m$) of the fragment ion $[\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_{11}\\mathrm{O}]^+$ is:\n$$m = (4 \\times m_{\\mathrm{C}}) + (11 \\times m_{\\mathrm{H}}) + (1 \\times m_{\\mathrm{O}})$$\n$$m = (4 \\times 12.000000) + (11 \\times 1.007825) + (1 \\times 15.994915)$$\n$$m = 48.000000 + 11.086075 + 15.994915$$\n$$m = 75.080990\\,\\mathrm{amu}$$\n\nThe problem states to assume a single positive charge, so $z=1$. Therefore, the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) is numerically equal to the mass.\n$$m/z = \\frac{75.080990}{1} = 75.080990$$\n\nFinally, we must round the answer to four significant figures.\n$$75.080990 \\approx 75.08$$\n\nThe predicted $m/z$ of the most abundant fragment ion is $75.08$.",

            "problem": "A molecule contains both a tertiary amine and an ether, creating two distinct heteroatom centers that can potentially direct $\\alpha$ cleavage under Electron Ionization (EI).

Under standard EI at $70$ eV, the molecular ion is an odd-electron radical cation, denoted $M^{+\\bullet}$. Within gas-phase fragmentation of odd-electron ions, homolytic $\\alpha$ cleavage adjacent to a heteroatom with a nonbonding electron pair is frequently observed, producing an even-electron cation fragment that is charge-stabilized by the heteroatom (e.g., iminium for nitrogen, oxonium for oxygen) and a neutral radical. The competition among possible $\\alpha$ cleavages is governed by (i) the stabilization of the even-electron cation fragment (including resonance, inductive and hyperconjugative effects, and the electronegativity of the heteroatom bearing the charge), and (ii) the stabilization of the departing neutral radical (with the usual order that tertiary and benzylic radicals are more stabilized than secondary and primary radicals, and radicals $\\alpha$ to heteroatoms can have additional captodative and lone-pair resonance stabilization).

            "solution": "Begin from the fundamental base for Electron Ionization (EI) fragmentation: EI produces an odd-electron radical cation $M^{+\\bullet}$. For such ions, homolytic scission is prevalent. A heteroatom with a nonbonding electron pair (nitrogen or oxygen) can assist $\\alpha$ cleavage, yielding an even-electron cation that is heteroatom-stabilized (iminium for nitrogen, oxonium for oxygen), plus a neutral radical. The relative rates and abundances of products in EI fragmentation correlate with thermodynamic stabilization: the more stabilized even-electron cation fragment and the more stabilized neutral radical make an $\\alpha$ cleavage pathway more favorable, provided a feasible pathway exists. Additionally, for odd-electron ions, inductive (heterolytic) cleavage is generally disfavored compared to homolytic $\\alpha$ cleavage; inductive cleavage is more characteristic of even-electron ions (such as protonated molecules formed under Chemical Ionization (CI)).\n\nWe now analyze each option by evaluating the stabilization of both the even-electron cation fragment and the departing radical, using well-tested qualitative trends:\n\n- Even-electron cation stabilization: iminium-type cations $[\\text{R}_2\\text{N=CHR}]^+$ are strongly stabilized by resonance with the nitrogen lone-pair framework and by hyperconjugation from adjacent alkyl substituents; oxygen-based oxonium-type cations $[\\text{R}_2\\text{O=CHR}]^+$ also benefit from heteroatom assistance but are generally less charge-delocalized due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen, often rendering them less stabilized in the gas phase relative to iminium analogs formed under comparable substitution. Further substitution that can donate electron density into the cationic framework may provide additional stabilization.\n\n- Radical stabilization: the typical order is benzylic $\\approx$ tertiary $>$ secondary $>$ primary, and radicals $\\alpha$ to heteroatoms can enjoy additional stabilization via captodative effects and lone-pair resonance (e.g., $\\alpha$-oxy or $\\alpha$-amino radicals). Benzylic radicals are notably stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. Primary $\\alpha$-amino radicals are stabilized relative to simple primary alkyl radicals but still less than benzylic radicals.\n\nOption A: $\\alpha$ cleavage at nitrogen to form $[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{N=CH}_2]^+$ and $\\text{Ph-CH}_2\\text{-O-CH}_2^{\\bullet}$.\n- Even-electron cation: $[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{N=CH}_2]^+$ is a prototypical iminium-type cation. This cation is well-known to be strongly stabilized by resonance between the $\\text{C=N}$ framework and the adjacent nitrogen, with charge delocalization over the $\\text{C-N}$ system. Nitrogen’s lower electronegativity compared to oxygen allows more effective charge accommodation and delocalization, making iminium species particularly favored in EI fragmentation of amines.\n- Departing radical: $\\text{Ph-CH}_2\\text{-O-CH}_2^{\\bullet}$ is an $\\alpha$-oxy radical. Such radicals can be stabilized by resonance interaction that places radical density on oxygen, consistent with $\\text{R-O-CH}_2^{\\bullet} \\leftrightarrow \\text{R-}\\dot{\\text{O}}\\text{=CH}_2$, and also benefit from the captodative effect of an adjacent heteroatom. While not as stabilized as a benzylic radical, it is substantially more stabilized than a simple primary alkyl radical.\n- Net assessment: This pathway pairs a very stabilized even-electron cation (iminium) with a moderately stabilized radical, which is a favorable combination. In practice, amines often show dominant iminium fragments (e.g., a common base peak near $m/z=58$ for $[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{N=CH}_2]^+$), reflecting this strong thermodynamic driving force.\n\nOption B: $\\alpha$ cleavage at oxygen on the benzylic side to form $[\\text{Ph-O=CH}_2]^+$ and $^{\\bullet}\\text{CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-N(CH}_3)_2$.\n- Even-electron cation: $[\\text{Ph-O=CH}_2]^+$ is an oxonium-type cation. It can have some additional stabilization from the adjacent aryl group, but oxygen’s higher electronegativity typically limits charge delocalization compared to nitrogen. As a class, comparable oxonium cations are generally less stabilized than iminium cations under similar substitution patterns.\n- Departing radical: $^{\\bullet}\\text{CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-N(CH}_3)_2$ is a primary $\\alpha$-amino radical. While the adjacent $\\text{N(CH}_3)_2$ offers some stabilization, the radical remains primary and is less stabilized than benzylic or tertiary radicals and less than many $\\alpha$-oxy radicals.\n- Net assessment: Both the cation and radical are less favorable than in Option A, making this pathway comparatively disfavored.\n\nOption C: $\\alpha$ cleavage at oxygen on the aliphatic side to form $[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{N-CH}_2\\text{-O=CH}_2]^+$ and $\\text{Ph-CH}_2^{\\bullet}$.\n- Even-electron cation: $[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{N-CH}_2\\text{-O=CH}_2]^+$ is an aliphatic oxonium-type cation. There may be some donor stabilization from the adjacent $\\text{N(CH}_3)_2$ substituent via inductive or through-bond effects, but the cationic framework remains oxonium-like and, as in Option B, less generally stabilized than an iminium of comparable substitution.\n- Departing radical: $\\text{Ph-CH}_2^{\\bullet}$ is a benzylic radical, which is highly stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring.\n- Net assessment: This pathway offers a highly stabilized radical but a less stabilized cation compared to Option A. In EI $\\alpha$ cleavage of odd-electron ions, the stability of the resulting even-electron cation fragment is often the dominant determinant of the base peak. Thus, while Option C benefits from an exceptionally stabilized radical, it lacks the superior cation stabilization of Option A and is expected to be less favored overall for the dominant fragment.\n\nOption D: Inductive cleavage dominates: heterolytic $\\text{C-O}$ scission to give $\\text{Ph-CH}_2^+$ and $[\\text{O-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-N(CH}_3)_2]^{\\bullet}$ as principal pathway under EI.\n- Mechanistic consistency: Inductive cleavage in the sense of heterolytic scission that directly produces a carbocation and a radical fragment is atypical as the dominant pathway for odd-electron $M^{+\\bullet}$ ions formed under EI. Odd-electron ions favor homolytic $\\alpha$ cleavage pathways in which the even-electron cation fragment is heteroatom-stabilized, plus a neutral radical. Charge-directed heterolytic processes termed inductive cleavage commonly dominate for even-electron ions (e.g., protonated molecules in CI), not for EI-generated $M^{+\\bullet}$.\n- Net assessment: This proposal is mechanistically inconsistent with the prevailing fragmentation mode for odd-electron EI molecular ions and is therefore unlikely to dominate.\n\nConclusion: Option A most effectively balances a strongly stabilized even-electron cation (iminium) with a reasonably stabilized $\\alpha$-oxy radical, matching known EI behavior of amines, and consequently is expected to dominate. Options B and C suffer from less favorable cation stabilization (oxonium versus iminium), and D invokes a mechanism not favored for odd-electron EI molecular ions.\n\nVerdicts:\n- A: Correct — iminium formation with a stabilized $\\alpha$-oxy radical is the most favorable $\\alpha$ cleavage.\n- B: Incorrect — oxonium cation and primary $\\alpha$-amino radical are less favorable than A.\n- C: Incorrect — although the benzylic radical is highly stabilized, the oxonium cation is less stabilized than the iminium cation in A, making C less favorable overall.\n- D: Incorrect — inductive (heterolytic) cleavage does not dominate for odd-electron EI molecular ions.",
