            "problem": "In a mass spectrometer using the Electron Impact (EI) ionization method, a neutral molecule, M, which is a stable, closed-shell species, is bombarded by a beam of high-energy electrons. This interaction typically causes one electron to be ejected from the molecule, forming a species denoted as $M^{+\\bullet}$, which is called the molecular ion. The overall process can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\text{M} + e^{-} (\\text{high energy}) \\rightarrow \\text{M}^{+\\bullet} + 2e^{-} (\\text{low energy})\n$$\n\nThe molecular ion, $M^{+\\bullet}$, is correctly described as a \"radical cation\".

The species is a radical because the neutral molecule, having all its electrons spin-paired, loses a single electron, which necessarily leaves one electron unpaired.\n\nD. The species is a cation because it has gained a proton (H$^{+}$) during the ionization process.\n\nE. The species is a radical because the high-energy impact immediately causes a covalent bond to break homolytically, forming two species with unpaired electrons.",
            "solution": "The defining features of a radical cation are: (i) it carries a net positive charge (cation), and (ii) it possesses at least one unpaired electron (radical).

This directly supports statement A. Statement D is incorrect because EI does not involve proton transfer; protonation would be characteristic of other ionization methods (e.g., chemical ionization), not EI.\n\nSpin/electron-count reasoning (radical): For a closed-shell molecule, the electron count $N$ is even and all electrons are paired. Removing a single electron yields $N-1$, which is odd, necessarily leaving one electron unpaired. Therefore, the product is a radical. This directly supports statement C. Statement B is incorrect because the incoming electron is not trapped; instead, it imparts energy that ejects an electron from M, and the two electrons on the product side are the ejected electron and the scattered incident electron. Statement E is not a correct basis for the classification: while EI molecular ions may fragment and some fragmentations can involve homolytic bond cleavage, the radical character of the molecular ion arises from the loss of a single electron from a closed-shell species, not from immediate bond homolysis.\n\nTherefore, the complete and correct reasoning is given by A and C.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the mean free path $\\lambda$ of a neutral molecule in a dilute gas, its numerical evaluation under typical electron ionization (EI) source conditions, and an interpretation of the result. The analysis will be based on the principles of the kinetic theory of gases and the ideal gas law.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Mean Free Path Expression**\n\nThe mean free path $\\lambda$ is defined as the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. It can be expressed as the ratio of the mean speed of the particles $\\langle v \\rangle$ to their collision frequency $z$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{z}\n$$\nThe collision frequency $z$ for a single particle moving in a gas of identical particles is the product of the number density of target particles $n$, the collision cross-section $\\sigma$, and the mean relative speed between the colliding particles $\\langle v_{\\text{rel}} \\rangle$:\n$$\nz = n \\sigma \\langle v_{\\text{rel}} \\rangle\n$$\nA crucial insight from the kinetic theory of gases, specifically for a gas following a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution, is that the mean speed of particles relative to each other is greater than the mean speed of a single particle relative to a fixed frame. The mean relative speed is given by $\\langle v_{\\text{rel}} \\rangle = \\sqrt{2} \\langle v \\rangle$. Substituting this into the expression for $z$ yields:\n$$\nz = n \\sigma (\\sqrt{2} \\langle v \\rangle)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $z$ back into the definition of $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{n \\sigma \\sqrt{2} \\langle v \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma}\n$$\nThe problem models the organic molecule as a hard sphere with an effective collision diameter $d$. The collision cross-section $\\sigma$ represents the effective area that one molecule presents to another for a collision to occur. For two identical hard spheres of diameter $d$ (and radius $r=d/2$), a collision occurs if their centers approach within a distance of $d$. Thus, the collision cross-section is the area of a circle with a radius equal to the collision diameter $d$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\pi d^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\lambda$ gives the mean free path in terms of particle properties ($d$) and gas properties ($n$):\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 n}\n$$\nThe final step is to relate the number density $n$ to the macroscopic state variables of pressure $P$ and temperature $T$. For a dilute gas, the ideal gas law provides an excellent approximation:\n$$\nPV = N k_{\\mathrm{B}} T\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the volume, $N$ is the number of particles, and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant. The number density $n$ is defined as $n = N/V$. Rearranging the ideal gas law gives:\n$$\nn = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{P}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $n$ into our equation for $\\lambda$ yields the final desired expression for the mean free path in terms of $T$, $P$, and $d$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 \\left(\\frac{P}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 P}\n$$\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation of the Mean Free Path**\n\nWe are given the following values. First, we must convert them to a consistent set of SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds, Kelvin).\n\n*   Temperature: $T = 473\\ \\mathrm{K}$ (already in SI units)\n*   Pressure: $P = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$. Using the conversion factor $1\\ \\mathrm{Torr} = 133.322\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$:\n    $P = (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Torr}) \\times (133.322\\ \\mathrm{Pa/Torr}) = 1.33322 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n*   Collision diameter: $d = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. Since $1\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n    $d = 0.50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n*   Boltzmann constant: $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$ (already in SI units)\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (473\\ \\mathrm{K})}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (0.50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 (1.33322 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa})}\n$$\nLet's evaluate the numerator and the denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{B}} T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 473 \\approx 6.5295 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J}\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 P = \\sqrt{2} \\pi (0.50 \\times 10^{-9})^2 (1.33322 \\times 10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 P = \\sqrt{2} \\pi (2.5 \\times 10^{-19}) (1.33322 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 1.4810 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J}\n$$\n(Note: The units $\\mathrm{m}^2 \\times \\mathrm{Pa} = \\mathrm{m}^2 \\times (\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2) = \\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} = \\mathrm{J}$, so the units are consistent)\n\nDividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{6.5295 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{1.4810 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J}} \\approx 4.4088\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem specifies rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\lambda \\approx 4.41\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n\n**3. Interpretation of the Result**\n\nThe calculated mean free path is $\\lambda \\approx 4.41\\ \\mathrm{m}$. We are asked to compare this to a characteristic dimension of an EI source, given as $L = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe ratio of the mean free path to the source dimension is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda}{L} = \\frac{4.41\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.020\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 220\n$$\nThe mean free path is more than $200$ times larger than the characteristic length of the ionization region ($\\lambda \\gg L$). The physical implication of this result is that a neutral molecule, upon entering the EI source, is extremely unlikely to collide with another neutral molecule during its transit through the ionization region. The average molecule travels a distance of $4.41$ meters before undergoing a collision, but the source itself is only $2$ centimeters long.\n\nThis condition is fundamental to the design and operation of an EI mass spectrometer. The goal of EI is to study the unimolecular fragmentation of an isolated molecule caused by ionization from a high-energy electron. If intermolecular collisions were frequent (i.e., if $\\lambda$ were comparable to or smaller than $L$), then ion-molecule reactions or collisional activation of neutrals would occur. These secondary processes would produce a mass spectrum reflecting complex gas-phase chemistry rather than the intrinsic fragmentation pattern of the parent molecule, thereby confounding the structural elucidation of the analyte. The high vacuum (low pressure) in the EI source ensures a long mean free path, effectively isolating the molecules from each other and guaranteeing that the observed mass spectrum is a direct consequence of the initial electron-impact event.",
