            "problem": "In electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry of esters, bond cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl group (known as $\\alpha$-cleavage) is a dominant pathway. For the specific case of methyl hexanoate with molecular formula $C_7H_{14}O_2$, consider $\\alpha$-cleavage on the alkoxy side (i.e., cleavage of the $C_{\\text{carbonyl}}-O_{\\text{alkoxy}}$ single bond). This process forms a resonance-stabilized acylium cation on the acyl side and expels a neutral alkoxy radical. Using the foundational definitions that (i) the mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ equals $m$ divided by $z$, (ii) EI generally produces singly charged cations so that $z=1$ for the fragment ion, and (iii) nominal masses use integer atomic weights, determine the nominal $m/z$ for the acylium cation formed from methyl hexanoate by the described $\\alpha$-cleavage. Use $C=12$, $H=1$, and $O=16$ for atomic weights. Express your final result as a dimensionless $m/z$ value and provide the exact integer nominal value (no rounding).",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary information to determine a unique, meaningful solution based on established principles of mass spectrometry.\n\nThe first step is to establish the chemical structure of methyl hexanoate, given the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}O_2$. The name \"hexanoate\" indicates a carboxylate group derived from hexanoic acid, which contains a chain of $6$ carbon atoms (a pentyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon). The \"methyl\" prefix indicates that a methyl group is attached to the alkoxy oxygen of the ester functionality. Therefore, the structure of methyl hexanoate is $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2CH_2C(=O)OCH_3$. A count of the atoms confirms the molecular formula: $5$ carbons in the pentyl chain plus $1$ carbonyl carbon plus $1$ methyl carbon total $7$ carbons ($C_7$); $11$ hydrogens on the pentyl chain plus $3$ hydrogens on the methyl group total $14$ hydrogens ($H_{14}$); and $2$ oxygen atoms ($O_2$). The formula $C_7H_{14}O_2$ is correct.\n\nThe problem specifies electron ionization (EI), which first generates a molecular ion, $[C_7H_{14}O_2]^{+\\bullet}$, by ejection of an electron. The problem then directs us to consider a specific fragmentation process: $\\alpha$-cleavage on the alkoxy side of the carbonyl group. This corresponds to the cleavage of the single bond between the carbonyl carbon and the ester oxygen atom ($C_{\\text{carbonyl}}-O_{\\text{alkoxy}}$).\n\nThis homolytic cleavage partitions the radical cation: the acyl portion retains the positive charge to form a stable acylium cation, and the alkoxy portion is expelled as a neutral radical. The fragmentation reaction can be written as:\n\n$$\n[CH_3(CH_2)_4C(=O)OCH_3]^{+\\bullet} \\rightarrow [CH_3(CH_2)_4C=O]^+ + \\cdot OCH_3\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of the resulting acylium cation, which is $[CH_3(CH_2)_4C=O]^+$.\n\nFirst, we determine the chemical formula of this acylium cation fragment. The acyl group, $CH_3(CH_2)_4C=O$, consists of:\n- Carbon ($C$): $1$ methyl carbon + $4$ methylene carbons + $1$ carbonyl carbon = $6$ carbon atoms.\n- Hydrogen ($H$): $3$ hydrogens in the methyl group + $4 \\times 2$ hydrogens in the methylene groups = $3 + 8 = 11$ hydrogen atoms.\n- Oxygen ($O$): $1$ carbonyl oxygen atom.\n\nThus, the chemical formula of the acylium cation is $[C_6H_{11}O]^+$.\n\nNext, we calculate the nominal mass ($m$) of this fragment using the provided integer atomic weights: $C=12$, $H=1$, and $O=16$.\n\nThe mass ($m$) is calculated as follows:\n$$\nm = (6 \\times \\text{atomic mass of } C) + (11 \\times \\text{atomic mass of } H) + (1 \\times \\text{atomic mass of } O)\n$$\nSubstituting the given integer values:\n$$\nm = (6 \\times 12) + (11 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 16)\n$$\n$$\nm = 72 + 11 + 16\n$$\n$$\nm = 99\n$$\n\nThe problem states that electron ionization produces singly charged cations, so the charge ($z$) of the acylium ion is $1$. The mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) is defined as the mass ($m$) divided by the charge ($z$).\n\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{99}{1} = 99\n$$\n\nTherefore, the nominal $m/z$ value for the acylium cation formed from the specified $\\alpha$-cleavage of methyl hexanoate is $99$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard fragmentation process in mass spectrometry, the McLafferty rearrangement, for a specific molecule, methyl hexanoate. All necessary data, including atomic masses and the charge of the ion, are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is solvable using established principles of organic chemistry.\n\nThe problem asks for the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of the fragment ion resulting from the McLafferty rearrangement of methyl hexanoate, as well as the identity of the neutral molecule that is eliminated.\n\nFirst, we identify the structure of methyl hexanoate. The condensed formula is given as $\\mathrm{CH_3(CH_2)_4COOCH_3}$. The hexanoate part indicates an acyl chain with a total of $6$ carbon atoms. The full structure is:\n$$ \\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-C(=O)O-CH_3} $$\nThe molecular formula is $\\mathrm{C_7H_{14}O_2}$.

We label the acyl chain carbons relative to the carbonyl carbon:\n$$ \\mathrm{CH_3}(\\epsilon)-\\mathrm{CH_2}(\\delta)-\\mathrm{CH_2}(\\gamma)-\\mathrm{CH_2}(\\beta)-\\mathrm{CH_2}(\\alpha)-\\mathrm{C}(=\\mathrm{O})\\mathrm{O-CH_3} $$\nAs seen, methyl hexanoate possesses hydrogens on the $\\gamma$-carbon, so the rearrangement can occur. The mechanism involves the abstraction of a $\\gamma$-hydrogen by the carbonyl oxygen through a six-membered cyclic transition state, followed by cleavage of the bond between the $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-carbons.\n\nLet's depict the process:\n1.  Electron ionization forms the molecular ion, $[\\mathrm{C_7H_{14}O_2}]^{+\\bullet}$, with a nominal mass of $130$.\n2.  A $\\gamma$-hydrogen is transferred to the carbonyl oxygen.\n3.  The $\\mathrm{C}(\\alpha)-\\mathrm{C}(\\beta)$ bond cleaves.\n4.  A new double bond forms between the $\\mathrm{C}(\\beta)$ and $\\mathrm{C}(\\gamma)$ atoms.\n\nThis fragmentation partitions the molecular ion into two species: a neutral alkene and a radical cation.\n\nLet's identify the neutral species lost. This species is formed from the terminal part of the acyl chain, starting from the $\\beta$-carbon. This portion of the original chain is $\\mathrm{-CH_2}(\\beta)-\\mathrm{CH_2}(\\gamma)-\\mathrm{CH_2}(\\delta)-\\mathrm{CH_3}(\\epsilon)$. After the transfer of one $\\gamma$-hydrogen and the formation of a double bond between $\\mathrm{C}(\\beta)$ and $\\mathrm{C}(\\gamma)$, the resulting neutral molecule is:\n$$ \\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH_2-CH_3} $$\nThis molecule is 1-butene. Its molecular formula is $\\mathrm{C_4H_8}$. Its common name is butene.\nThe nominal mass of this neutral loss is:\n$$ m_{\\text{neutral}} = (4 \\times 12) + (8 \\times 1) = 48 + 8 = 56 $$\n\nNext, we identify the charged fragment ion, which is the characteristic McLafferty rearrangement product. This fragment consists of the remaining part of the molecule: the methoxycarbonyl group, the $\\alpha$-carbon and its hydrogens, and the transferred $\\gamma$-hydrogen. The structure of this ion is an enol radical cation:\n$$ [\\mathrm{CH_2=C(OH)OCH_3}]^{+\\bullet} $$\nTo find its $m/z$ value, we first determine its molecular formula. Counting the atoms:\n-   Carbon (C): $1$ from $\\mathrm{CH_2}$, $1$ from $\\mathrm{C(OH)}$, and $1$ from $\\mathrm{OCH_3}$, for a total of $3$.\n-   Hydrogen (H): $2$ from $\\mathrm{CH_2}$, $1$ from $\\mathrm{OH}$, and $3$ from $\\mathrm{OCH_3}$, for a total of $6$.\n-   Oxygen (O): $1$ from $\\mathrm{OH}$ and $1$ from the ester linkage, for a total of $2$.\nThe formula of the fragment ion is thus $\\mathrm{C_3H_6O_2}$.\n\nNow, we compute the nominal mass ($m$) of this ion:\n$$ m_{\\text{ion}} = (3 \\times 12) + (6 \\times 1) + (2 \\times 16) = 36 + 6 + 32 = 74 $$\nThe problem states the charge, $z$, is $1$. Therefore, the mass-to-charge ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{74}{1} = 74 $$\n\nAs a verification, we can subtract the mass of the neutral loss from the mass of the parent molecular ion:\n$$ m_{\\text{ion}} = M_{\\text{parent}} - m_{\\text{neutral}} = 130 - 56 = 74 $$\nThe results from both methods are consistent.\n\nThe neutral species lost is butene, with a molecular formula of $\\mathrm{C_4H_8}$. The McLafferty rearrangement ion has an $m/z$ of $74$. The question asks for the final $m/z$ value as an exact integer.",

The nominal mass is defined as the sum of integer atomic masses and is appropriate for surveying expected positions of common fragment ions.

For butanoic acid, this would be the propyl radical cation at $m/z=43$. In contrast, methyl esters do not contain a free $\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ carboxyl group; their dominant cleavages adjacent to the carbonyl typically produce acylium ions and may involve loss of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\mathrm{O}$ ($31$) or $\\mathrm{COOCH}_{3}$ ($59$), rather than $\\mathrm{COOH}$ ($45$). Thus, the $M-45$ loss is more characteristic and generally more intense for the acid than for the methyl ester.

For methyl propanoate, this produces a prominent ion at $m/z=57$, corresponding to the propanoyl acylium ion $\\mathrm{C}_{3}\\mathrm{H}_{5}\\mathrm{O}^{+}$. Carboxylic acids do not contain a methoxy substituent and thus ordinarily do not exhibit an $M-31$ loss via methoxy radical expulsion; any $M-31$ route would be mechanistically disfavored and weak.
