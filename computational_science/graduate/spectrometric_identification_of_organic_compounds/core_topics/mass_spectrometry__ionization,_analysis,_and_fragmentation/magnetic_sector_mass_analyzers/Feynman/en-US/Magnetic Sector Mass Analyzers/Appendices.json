            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism as applied to mass spectrometry, contains all necessary information, and uses realistic physical parameters. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe analysis of an ion's trajectory in a magnetic sector mass analyzer is governed by two fundamental principles. First, an ion of mass $m$ and charge $q$, accelerated from rest through an electrostatic potential difference $V$, gains kinetic energy $K$. By the work-energy theorem, this kinetic energy is equal to the work done on the ion by the electric field:\n$$K = qV$$\nAssuming nonrelativistic motion, the kinetic energy is also given by:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\nwhere $v$ is the final velocity of the ion upon entering the magnetic field. Equating these two expressions for kinetic energy yields our first governing equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qV \\quad (1)$$\n\nSecond, when the ion enters the uniform magnetic field $B$ with its velocity vector perpendicular to the field lines, it experiences a Lorentz force, $F_B$. The magnitude of this force is given by:\n$$F_B = qvB$$\nThis force is always perpendicular to the ion's velocity, acting as a centripetal force that constrains the ion to a circular path. For the ion to be transmitted, the radius of this path must be equal to the fixed bending radius $\\rho$ of the analyzer. The required centripetal force, $F_c$, is:\n$$F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{\\rho}$$\nEquating the magnetic force to the centripetal force gives our second governing equation:\n$$qvB = \\frac{mv^2}{\\rho} \\quad (2)$$\n\nOur goal is to find an expression for the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/q$, that is independent of the ion's velocity $v$. We can rearrange equation $(2)$ to solve for $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{qB\\rho}{m}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $v$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{qB\\rho}{m}\\right)^2 = qV$$\nExpanding the squared term:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{q^2B^2\\rho^2}{m^2}\\right) = qV$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling terms:\n$$\\frac{q^2B^2\\rho^2}{2m} = qV$$\nWe can divide both sides by $q$ (since $q \\neq 0$ for an ion) and rearrange the equation to solve for the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/q$:\n$$\\frac{qB^2\\rho^2}{2m} = V$$\n$$\\frac{m}{q} = \\frac{B^2\\rho^2}{2V}$$\n\nThe problem states that the acceleration potential $V$ and the bending radius $\\rho$ are fixed. Therefore, the maximum mass-to-charge ratio, $(\\frac{m}{q})_{\\max}$, that can be transmitted through the analyzer corresponds to the maximum achievable magnetic field strength, $B_{\\max}$. The derived expression is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{m}{q}\\right)_{\\max} = \\frac{B_{\\max}^2 \\rho^2}{2V}$$\n\nWe are given the following values for evaluation:\n$B_{\\max} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n$\\rho = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$V = 3\\,\\mathrm{kV} = 3 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression gives the maximum mass-to-charge ratio in SI units ($\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{C}^{-1}$):\n$$\\left(\\frac{m}{q}\\right)_{\\max} = \\frac{(1.2\\,\\mathrm{T})^2 (0.3\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 (3 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})} = \\frac{(1.44\\,\\mathrm{T}^2)(0.09\\,\\mathrm{m}^2)}{6000\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.1296}{6000} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{C}}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{m}{q}\\right)_{\\max} = 2.16 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{C}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in Thomson (Th), where $1\\,\\mathrm{Th}$ is defined as one dalton per elementary charge ($1\\,\\mathrm{Da}/e$).

The problem states that the motion is non-relativistic. An ion of mass $m$ and charge $q$ accelerated from rest through an electric potential $V$ gains a kinetic energy $KE$ given by:\n$$KE = qV$$\nThe non-relativistic kinetic energy is also expressed as $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the final velocity of the ion. Equating these two expressions gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qV$$\nThe momentum $p$ of the ion is $p = mv$. We can express the kinetic energy in terms of momentum:\n$$KE = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$$\nCombining this with the energy gained from the potential, we have:\n$$\\frac{p^2}{2m} = qV$$\nSolving for the momentum $p$:\n$$p^2 = 2mqV \\implies p = \\sqrt{2mqV}$$\nThe problem defines the ion's required magnetic rigidity as $B\\rho_{\\text{ion}} = p/q$. This relationship is derived from the balance between the magnetic force and the centrifugal force for an ion moving in a circular path of radius $\\rho$ within a uniform magnetic field $B$:\n$$qvB = \\frac{mv^2}{\\rho} \\implies qB\\rho = mv = p$$\nThus, $B\\rho = p/q$. Substituting our expression for momentum $p$ into this definition gives the required magnetic rigidity for the ion:\n$$B\\rho_{\\text{ion}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mqV}}{q} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mqV}{q^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mV}{q}}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the required magnetic rigidity.\n\nNow we perform the numerical calculation for $B\\rho_{\\text{ion}}$.\nThe given values are:\n- $m = 300\\,\\mathrm{u} = 300 \\times (1.66054 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 4.98162 \\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $V = 8\\,\\mathrm{kV} = 8 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- The ion is singly charged, so $q = e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$B\\rho_{\\text{ion}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (4.98162 \\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (8 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}}}$$\n$$B\\rho_{\\text{ion}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{7.970592 \\times 10^{-21}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}}}\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m}$$\n$$B\\rho_{\\text{ion}} = \\sqrt{0.049754007}\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m}$$\n$$B\\rho_{\\text{ion}} \\approx 0.22305606\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the required magnetic rigidity is:\n$$B\\rho_{\\text{ion}} = 0.2231\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the magnetic rigidity margin, $\\Delta(B\\rho)$. The margin is defined as the difference between the magnet's available rigidity and the ion's required rigidity:\n$$\\Delta(B\\rho) = B\\rho_{\\text{magnet}} - B\\rho_{\\text{ion}}$$\nThe magnet's available rigidity is given by the product of its nominal magnetic field strength $B$ and its intended bending radius $\\rho$:\n$$B\\rho_{\\text{magnet}} = B \\rho = (0.8\\,\\mathrm{T}) \\times (0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m}$$\nNow, we calculate the margin using the unrounded value for $B\\rho_{\\text{ion}}$ to maintain precision:\n$$\\Delta(B\\rho) = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m} - 0.22305606\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m}$$\n$$\\Delta(B\\rho) \\approx 0.17694394\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures:\n$$\\Delta(B\\rho) = 0.1769\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m}$$\nThe positive margin indicates that the magnet's field strength is more than sufficient to bend this specific ion along the desired trajectory radius.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks in the order they are given.\n\n#### Task 1: Justification of the quadratic model for mass calibration\nWe begin with the two fundamental equations provided:\nThe kinetic energy gained by an ion of mass $m$ and charge $ze$ accelerated through a potential $V$ is given by:\n$$z e V = \\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$$\nThe radius $r$ of the circular path of this ion in a uniform magnetic field of flux density $B$ is:\n$$r = \\frac{m v}{z e B}$$\nIn a magnetic sector instrument, the radius of the ion path $r$ is fixed by the geometry of the analyzer, and for a B-scan, the accelerating potential $V$ is held constant. We need to find a relationship between the mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ and the magnetic flux density $B$.\n\nFirst, we solve the kinetic energy equation for the ion velocity $v$:\n$$v^2 = \\frac{2 z e V}{m} \\implies v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 z e V}{m}}$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $v$ into the equation for the radius $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{m}{z e B} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2 z e V}{m}} \\right)$$\nTo simplify, we can bring the terms outside the square root inside:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{B} \\sqrt{\\frac{m^2}{(z e)^2} \\frac{2 z e V}{m}} = \\frac{1}{B} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m V}{z e}}$$\nTo solve for the mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{1}{B^2} \\frac{2 m V}{z e}$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate $m/z$:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = r^2 B^2 \\frac{e}{2V}$$\nSince $r$, $V$, and the elementary charge $e$ are all constants during the B-scan experiment, we can group them into a single constant $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{r^2 e}{2V}$$\nThe relationship simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = K B^2$$\nThe problem states that the magnetic flux density $B$ is an affine function of the instrument's scan coordinate $x$:\n$$B \\approx \\alpha x + \\beta$$\nSubstituting this expression for $B$ into our equation for $m/z$ yields:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = K (\\alpha x + \\beta)^2$$\nExpanding the squared term gives:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = K (\\alpha^2 x^2 + 2\\alpha\\beta x + \\beta^2)$$\nDistributing the constant $K$ results in:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = (K\\alpha^2) x^2 + (2K\\alpha\\beta) x + (K\\beta^2)$$\nThis equation is a quadratic function of $x$.

We use the three provided reference points $(x_i, m_i)$ to create a system of three linear equations in the three unknowns $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\n1.  For $(x_1, m_1) = (150, 79.900)$:\n    $$a(150)^2 + b(150) + c = 79.900 \\implies 22500 a + 150 b + c = 79.900$$\n2.  For $(x_2, m_2) = (300, 294.400)$:\n    $$a(300)^2 + b(300) + c = 294.400 \\implies 90000 a + 300 b + c = 294.400$$\n3.  For $(x_3, m_3) = (420, 563.200)$:\n    $$a(420)^2 + b(420) + c = 563.200 \\implies 176400 a + 420 b + c = 563.200$$\n\nWe can solve this system by elimination. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$$(90000 - 22500) a + (300 - 150) b = 294.400 - 79.900$$\n$$67500 a + 150 b = 214.5 \\quad (\\text{Eq. i})$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the third gives:\n$$(176400 - 90000) a + (420 - 300) b = 563.200 - 294.400$$\n$$86400 a + 120 b = 268.8 \\quad (\\text{Eq. ii})$$\nNow we have a system of two equations for $a$ and $b$. From Eq. (ii), we can solve for $b$:\n$$120 b = 268.8 - 86400 a \\implies b = \\frac{268.8}{120} - \\frac{86400}{120} a = 2.24 - 720 a$$\nSubstitute this expression for $b$ into Eq. (i):\n$$67500 a + 150 (2.24 - 720 a) = 214.5$$\n$$67500 a + 336 - 108000 a = 214.5$$\n$$-40500 a = 214.5 - 336$$\n$$-40500 a = -121.5$$\n$$a = \\frac{121.5}{40500} = 0.003$$\nNow substitute the value of $a$ back to find $b$:\n$$b = 2.24 - 720(0.003) = 2.24 - 2.16 = 0.08$$\nFinally, use the first original equation to find $c$:\n$$c = 79.900 - 22500 a - 150 b$$\n$$c = 79.900 - 22500(0.003) - 150(0.08)$$\n$$c = 79.900 - 67.5 - 12 = 79.900 - 79.5 = 0.4$$\nThe coefficients are $a=0.003$, $b=0.08$, and $c=0.4$. The calibration equation is:\n$$m(x) = 0.003 x^2 + 0.08 x + 0.4$$\n\n#### Task 3: Estimation of the mass error\nWe need to find the uncertainty in mass, $\\sigma_m$, at the scan position $x^{\\ast}=350$, given the uncertainty in the position, $\\sigma_x = 0.020$. The relationship between the uncertainties is given by the linear propagation of uncertainty formula. Since mass $m$ is a function of a single variable $x$, the formula is:\n$$\\sigma_m = \\left| \\frac{dm}{dx} \\right| \\sigma_x$$\nThe derivative of the mass function $m(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\\frac{dm}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} (a x^2 + b x + c) = 2ax + b$$\nSubstituting the coefficient values:\n$$\\frac{dm}{dx} = 2(0.003)x + 0.08 = 0.006 x + 0.08$$\nNow we evaluate this derivative at the unknown's position, $x^{\\ast} = 350$:\n$$\\frac{dm}{dx} \\bigg|_{x=350} = 0.006(350) + 0.08 = 2.1 + 0.08 = 2.18$$\nThe units of this derivative are $\\text{Da} / (\\text{scan unit})$. Now we can calculate the mass uncertainty $\\sigma_m$:\n$$\\sigma_m = |2.18| \\times \\sigma_x = 2.18 \\frac{\\text{Da}}{\\text{scan unit}} \\times 0.020 \\, \\text{scan units}$$\n$$\\sigma_m = 0.0436 \\, \\text{Da}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.0436$ already has three significant figures.",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0436}$$"
