            "problem": "An odd-electron radical cation formed under Electron Ionization (EI) mass spectrometry of a saturated aliphatic ketone can undergo a McLafferty rearrangement if a suitable $\\gamma$-hydrogen is present. In this rearrangement, a hydrogen at the $\\gamma$-position relative to the carbonyl transfers to the carbonyl oxygen via a six-membered transition state, concomitant with cleavage of the $\\alpha$–$\\beta$ bond. This yields an odd-electron fragment ion that retains the carbonyl functionality (as an enol radical cation) and a neutral alkene composed of the $\\beta$-to-terminal segment. The mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) for a singly charged ion is given by the mass of the ion divided by its charge magnitude, and for an odd-electron radical cation formed by electron removal from a neutral molecule of a given elemental composition, the ion mass equals the neutral composition mass minus the electron mass.\n\nConsider $2$-heptanone, whose structure can be written as $\\mathrm{CH}_3{-}\\mathrm{CO}{-}\\mathrm{CH}_2{-}\\mathrm{CH}_2{-}\\mathrm{CH}_2{-}\\mathrm{CH}_2{-}\\mathrm{CH}_3$, with molecular formula $\\mathrm{C}_7\\mathrm{H}_{14}\\mathrm{O}$. Under Electron Ionization (EI), assume formation of a singly charged odd-electron molecular ion and a McLafferty rearrangement that proceeds from the longer alkyl side.

            "problem": "In Electron Ionization (EI) Mass Spectrometry (MS), a neutral organic molecule absorbs approximately $70$ electronvolts (eV) to form a radical cation, which can undergo bond cleavages and rearrangements driven by the formation of more stable ions and neutrals. A canonical McLafferty rearrangement is defined for carbonyl-containing compounds as an intramolecular transfer of a $\\gamma$ hydrogen (i.e., a hydrogen attached to the carbon $\\gamma$ to the carbonyl carbon) to the carbonyl oxygen via a cyclic $6$-membered transition state, concomitant with cleavage of the $\\alpha$–$\\beta$ carbon–carbon bond, producing an enol (or enol-like) radical cation and a neutral alkene.

            "solution": "The core of the problem is to analyze the structure of methyl acetate, $\\mathrm{CH_3COOCH_3}$, according to the strict labeling convention provided.\n\nThe structure of methyl acetate is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n & \\mathrm{O} & \\\\\n & \\| & \\\\\n\\mathrm{CH_3} - & \\mathrm{C} & - \\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{CH_3} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe carbonyl carbon is the carbon atom double-bonded to the oxygen, i.e., the central carbon in the $\\mathrm{C(=O)}$ group.\n\nAccording to the provided convention, we must identify $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ positions by counting along a continuous carbon–carbon chain starting from this carbonyl carbon.\n\nLet us examine the two possible paths extending from the carbonyl carbon:\n\n1.  **The Acyl Side:** This is the path towards the acyl methyl group, $\\mathrm{CH_3}-$.\n    - The carbonyl carbon is our starting point.\n    - The carbon of the methyl group ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$) is directly bonded to the carbonyl carbon. By definition, this is the $\\alpha$-carbon.\n    - The chain is Carbonyl-$\\mathrm{C}$ — $\\alpha$-$\\mathrm{C}$.\n    - This carbon chain terminates at the $\\alpha$-carbon. There is no $\\beta$-carbon and, consequently, no $\\gamma$-carbon along this path. Therefore, the hydrogens on this methyl group are $\\alpha$-hydrogens, not $\\gamma$-hydrogens.\n\n2.  **The Alkoxy Side:** This is the path towards the methoxy group, $-\\mathrm{OCH_3}$.\n    - The carbonyl carbon is directly bonded to an oxygen atom, not a carbon atom.\n    - The chain from the carbonyl carbon is Carbonyl-$\\mathrm{C}$ — $\\mathrm{O}$ — $\\mathrm{C}$.\n    - This path is not a \"continuous carbon–carbon chain\" as stipulated by the problem's strict definition. The chain is interrupted by the ester oxygen atom.\n    - Because the rule for labeling requires a continuous carbon-carbon chain, we cannot assign $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, or $\\gamma$ positions to the carbon on the alkoxy side of the ester.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on a rigorous application of the problem's stated rules, methyl acetate possesses an $\\alpha$-carbon (on the acyl side) but lacks any $\\beta$-carbon or $\\gamma$-carbon. The absence of a $\\gamma$-carbon means there can be no $\\gamma$-hydrogen. The necessary prerequisite for a classical McLafferty rearrangement—the presence of a $\\gamma$-hydrogen on a continuous carbon chain—is not met.

Furthermore, the classical McLafferty rearrangement involves cleavage of the $\\alpha$–$\\beta$ carbon–carbon bond, not a carbon–oxygen bond as this option suggests.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Methyl acetate lacks any $\\gamma$ hydrogen relative to the carbonyl along a continuous carbon–carbon chain, because the acyl side terminates at the $\\alpha$ methyl and the alkoxy side is separated from the carbonyl carbon by oxygen; therefore, the classical McLafferty rearrangement is not possible.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement perfectly aligns with our derivation. It correctly identifies that the acyl side only has an $\\alpha$-carbon and that the continuous carbon chain rule is violated on the alkoxy side due to the intervening oxygen atom. It draws the correct conclusion that the absence of a $\\gamma$-hydrogen precludes the classical McLafferty rearrangement.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Methyl acetate possesses a $\\gamma$ hydrogen on the acyl methyl carbon; labeling the carbonyl carbon as $\\mathrm{C_0}$ makes the acyl methyl $\\mathrm{C_\\gamma}$, enabling the McLafferty rearrangement.**\n- **Analysis:** This option incorrectly labels the positions. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl carbon is the $\\alpha$-carbon. The acyl methyl carbon is unequivocally the $\\alpha$-carbon, not the $\\gamma$-carbon. This labeling scheme has no basis in the standard chemical convention described.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Methyl acetate can undergo a McLafferty rearrangement only after rapid enolization to $\\mathrm{CH_2=COOCH_3}$, which creates a new $\\gamma$ position on the methoxy side that satisfies the $6$-membered transition state requirement.**\n- **Analysis:** This option proposes a prerequisite reaction (enolization of the neutral molecule) that is not part of the standard EI-MS process, which involves direct ionization of the parent molecule. The problem is about the fragmentation of the methyl acetate radical cation, not the radical cation of its enol tautomer. Moreover, even if one were to consider the enol radical cation, $[\\mathrm{CH_2=C(OH)OCH_3}]^{+\\bullet}$, the path to the methoxy group's carbon is still interrupted by an oxygen, and the reactant is no longer a carbonyl compound in the sense required for the defined rearrangement. The premise is scientifically unsound in this context.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

The carbons are numbered from the end closer to the carbonyl group for IUPAC naming, but for mechanistic discussion, it's often clearer to label positions relative to the carbonyl:\n- $C_3$ is the $\\alpha$-carbon.\n- $C_4$ is the $\\beta$-carbon.\n- $C_5$ is the $\\gamma$-carbon.\n- $C_6$ is the $\\delta$-carbon.\n\nThe problem states that a $\\gamma$-hydrogen is transferred. The hydrogens on $C_5$ are $\\gamma$-hydrogens. The molecular ion of $2$-hexanone ($C_6H_{12}O$) has a nominal mass of $6 \\times 12 + 12 \\times 1 + 16 = 100$. So, the molecular ion $[\\mathrm{M}]^{\\bullet +}$ has $m/z = 100$.\n\nThe rearrangement proceeds as follows:\n1.  A hydrogen atom from the $\\gamma$-carbon ($C_5$) is transferred to the carbonyl oxygen ($O$ on $C_2$).\n2.  The bond between the $\\alpha$-carbon ($C_3$) and the $\\beta$-carbon ($C_4$) cleaves.\n\nThis process yields two fragments:\n- **Neutral Fragment**: This fragment arises from carbons $C_4$, $C_5$, and $C_6$. The original chain segment is $-CH_2(4)-CH_2(5)-CH_3(6)$. After cleavage of the $C_3-C_4$ bond and loss of one H from $C_5$, a double bond forms. The neutral fragment is propene, $CH_2=CH-CH_3$. Its molecular formula is $C_3H_6$, with a mass of $3 \\times 12 + 6 \\times 1 = 42 \\text{ u}$.\n- **Charged Fragment (McLafferty Ion)**: This fragment contains atoms $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, the carbonyl oxygen, and the transferred hydrogen from $C_5$. Its structure is an enol radical cation: $[CH_3-C(OH)=CH_2]^{\\bullet+}$. Its molecular formula is $C_3H_6O$. Its mass is $3 \\times 12 + 6 \\times 1 + 16 = 58 \\text{ u}$.

For $2$-hexanone-$5,5$-$d_2$, it appears at $m/z = 59$. The mass shift is $59 - 58 = +1$. This observation would conclusively demonstrate that one atom from the $\\gamma$-position is incorporated into the charged fragment during the rearrangement.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Synthesize $2$-hexanone-$5,5$-$d_2$ (the $\\gamma$ methylene $C_5$ fully deuterated) and record the EI mass spectrum at $70$ eV; the McLafferty ion will be shifted by $+1$ ($m/z=59$) because one $\\gamma$ deuterium migrates into the enol radical cation, proving $\\gamma$-hydrogen transfer.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option proposes the correct experimental design: labeling the specific site ($\\gamma$-position) from which the hydrogen transfer is proposed to originate. The predicted outcome, a mass shift of $+1$ to $m/z = 59$, matches our derivation. The reasoning provided—that one $\\gamma$ deuterium migrates—is also correct according to the mechanism. This experiment provides direct and conclusive proof for the mechanism.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Synthesize $2$-hexanone-$3,3$-$d_2$ (the $\\alpha$ methylene $C_3$ fully deuterated) and record the EI mass spectrum at $70$ eV; the McLafferty ion will be shifted by $+2$ ($m/z=60$), thereby proving $\\gamma$-hydrogen transfer.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option proposes labeling the $\\alpha$-position ($C_3$). The McLafferty ion contains the $\\alpha$-carbon. The unlabeled ion $[CH_3-C(OH)=CH_2]^{\\bullet+}$ has mass $58$. With labeling at $C_3$, the ion would be $[CH_3-C(OH)=CD_2]^{\\bullet+}$, containing two deuterium atoms. Its mass would be $58 - 2(\\text{H}) + 2(\\text{D}) = 58 - 2 + 4 = 60$. So, the predicted mass shift to $m/z=60$ is correct. However, this experiment does not test the origin of the transferred hydrogen. It only confirms that the $\\alpha$-methylene group is retained in the ion. It provides no information about the $\\gamma$-position and therefore cannot prove $\\gamma$-hydrogen transfer. The conclusion \"thereby proving $\\gamma$-hydrogen transfer\" is fallacious.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Synthesize $2$-hexanone-$5,5$-$d_2$ and record the EI mass spectrum at $70$ eV; the McLafferty ion will be shifted by $+2$ ($m/z=60$) because both $\\gamma$ deuteriums migrate together in the $6$-membered transition state.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option proposes the correct experimental design. However, it predicts a mass shift of $+2$ ($m/z = 60$). This would mean both deuteriums from the $\\gamma$-position are transferred. The established mechanism involves the transfer of a single hydrogen/deuterium via a six-membered ring transition state. The simultaneous transfer of two atoms is mechanistically unfeasible and contradicts the model. Our derivation showed a shift of $+1$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Synthesize $2$-hexanone-$5,5$-$d_2$, isolate $[\\mathrm{M}]^{\\bullet +}$, and perform Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID); the McLafferty ion will show no shift ($m/z$ unchanged) because the deuterium remains in the neutral alkene.**\n- **Evaluation**: The McLafferty rearrangement is a unimolecular fragmentation of the molecular ion, which can occur spontaneously in the EI source or upon collisional activation (CID). The experimental method is plausible. However, the prediction that the McLafferty ion shows no mass shift is incorrect. This would imply that the transferred atom was not a deuterium. The reasoning that \"the deuterium remains in the neutral alkene\" is also flawed; one deuterium is transferred to the ion, and one remains in the neutral fragment. Therefore, the ion's mass must increase. It would have the same mass as the unlabeled ion ($m/z = 58$) only if a hydrogen from another position (not $\\gamma$) were transferred, which contradicts the hypothesis being tested.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Do not label the molecule; instead, admit deuterium gas to the EI source to promote exchange during ionization; the McLafferty ion will be shifted by $+1$ ($m/z=59$), demonstrating $\\gamma$-hydrogen transfer.**\n- **Evaluation**: This proposes an H/D exchange experiment in the gas phase by introducing $D_2$ gas into the EI source. This is not a reliable or specific method for labeling. C-H bonds on an aliphatic chain are generally non-labile and do not exchange readily under EI conditions. Any exchange that might occur through complex ion-molecule reactions would be non-specific, meaning hydrogens at multiple positions could potentially be replaced by deuterium. Therefore, observing a shift to $m/z = 59$ would not provide conclusive evidence that the exchange occurred at the $\\gamma$-position and that this deuterium was subsequently transferred. The experiment lacks the required site-specificity to prove the mechanism.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
