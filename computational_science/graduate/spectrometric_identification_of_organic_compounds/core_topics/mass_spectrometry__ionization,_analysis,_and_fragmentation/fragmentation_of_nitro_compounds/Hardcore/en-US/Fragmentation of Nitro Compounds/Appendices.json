            "problem": "In electron ionization mass spectrometry of nitro-containing organic molecules, common fragment ions include the nitrosyl cation $\\mathrm{NO}^{+}$, the nitrogen dioxide cation $\\mathrm{NO_{2}^{+}}$, the $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$ cation arising from nitro-group rearrangement, and the carbon dioxide cation $\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}$. Assume singly charged ions so that the observed mass-to-charge ratio satisfies $m/z = m$ in dalton (Da). Use the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) monoisotopic exact masses $m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) = 12.000000000$ Da, $m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) = 1.00782503223$ Da, $m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) = 14.00307400443$ Da, and $m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 15.99491461957$ Da.\n\nStarting from first principles, compute the exact monoisotopic masses of $\\mathrm{NO}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{NO_{2}^{+}}$, $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$, and $\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}$ by summing the exact atomic masses of their constituent atoms.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass spectrometry, self-contained, and free of contradictions or ambiguities that would preclude a rigorous solution.\n\nThe task is to calculate the minimum resolving power required to distinguish the closest pair of specified fragment ions in the $m/z \\approx 44$ region. This involves several steps: calculating the exact monoisotopic mass of each ion, identifying the relevant pair, and applying the definition of resolving power.\n\nThe given monoisotopic exact masses are:\n-   $m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) = 12.000000000$\n-   $m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) = 1.00782503223$\n-   $m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) = 14.00307400443$\n-   $m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 15.99491461957$\n\nThe mass of an ion is calculated by summing the masses of its constituent neutral atoms. The mass of the lost electron is negligible for resolving power calculations and is conventionally ignored, an approach consistent with the problem's instruction to sum the atomic masses.\n\nFirst, we compute the exact monoisotopic mass for each of the four specified cations.\n\n1.

Mass of the $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$ cation:\n    The ion consists of one $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom, two $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ atoms, one $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ atom, and one $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ atom.\n    $$m(\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}) = m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 2 \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) + m(^{16}\\mathrm{O})$$\n    $$m(\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}) = 12.00000000000 + 2 \\times 1.00782503223 + 14.00307400443 + 15.99491461957$$\n    $$m(\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}) = 44.01363868846$$\n    Rounding to six significant figures, the mass is $44.0136$.\n\n4.  Mass of the carbon dioxide cation, $\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}$:\n    The ion consists of one $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom and two $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ atoms.\n    $$m(\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}) = m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 2 \\times m(^{16}\\mathrm{O})$$\n    $$m(\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}) = 12.00000000000 + 2 \\times 15.99491461957 = 43.98982923914$$\n    Rounding to six significant figures, the mass is $43.9898$.\n\nNext, we identify the ions within the $m/z \\approx 44$ window and determine the pair with the closest masses. The relevant ions are $\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}$ (mass $m_1 \\approx 43.99$) and $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$ (mass $m_2 \\approx 44.01$). The other ions, $\\mathrm{NO}^{+}$ ($m \\approx 30.00$) and $\\mathrm{NO_{2}^{+}}$ ($m \\approx 45.99$), are not as close to $m/z=44$ or to each other. The closest pair is indeed $\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$.\n\nWe calculate the mass difference, $\\Delta m$, between these two ions using their unrounded masses for precision:\n$$m_1 = m(\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}) = 43.98982923914$$\n$$m_2 = m(\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}) = 44.01363868846$$\n$$\\Delta m = |m_2 - m_1| = |44.01363868846 - 43.98982923914| = 0.02380944932$$\n\nNow, we calculate the minimum resolving power, $R$, required to resolve this pair. The problem specifies the use of the formula $R = m/\\Delta m$. When dealing with two distinct peaks, the most rigorous choice for the mass $m$ in this formula is the average mass of the two peaks, $m_{avg} = (m_1 + m_2)/2$.\n$$m_{avg} = \\frac{43.98982923914 + 44.01363868846}{2} = 44.0017339638$$\nUsing this average mass and the calculated mass difference $\\Delta m$, the required resolving power is:\n$$R = \\frac{m_{avg}}{\\Delta m} = \\frac{44.0017339638}{0.02380944932} \\approx 1848.083$$\nThe problem requires this final value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 1848$$\n\nFinally, we address the qualitative question: whether an instrument with a resolving power of $R_{instrument} = 30,000$ can distinguish these ions. The minimum required resolving power is calculated to be $R_{min} \\approx 1848$. Since the instrument's resolving power is substantially greater than the minimum requirement ($30,000 \\gg 1848$), the instrument can easily distinguish the $\\mathrm{CO_{2}^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$ ions. In fact, the instrument's capability is more than $16$ times what is minimally needed, which would allow for excellent, baseline-level separation of the two peaks.",

            "solution": "The following is a rigorous validation and solution of the problem based on the principles of mass spectrometry.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n-   **Isomers:** An isomeric pair of benzene derivatives.\n-   **Elemental Composition:** $\\mathrm{C_6H_5NO_2}$.\n-   **Molecular Ion:** A molecular radical cation is observed at $m/z=123$ under Electron Ionization (EI) at $70 \\text{ eV}$.\n-   **Functional Groups:** One isomer is an aryl nitro compound ($\\mathrm{Ar-NO_2}$), identified as nitrobenzene. The other is an aryl nitrite ($\\mathrm{Ar-ONO}$), identified as phenyl nitrite.\n-   **Task:** Devise a fragmentation-based test using two diagnostic $m/z$ features to distinguish the isomers.\n-   **Fundamental Principles:**\n    1.  The molecular ion ($M^{+\\cdot}$) is an odd-electron radical cation. Fragments arise from homolytic cleavage, yielding an even-electron cation and a neutral radical.\n    2.  Favorable cleavages involve breaking the weakest bond and forming the most stabilized cation.\n    3.  The $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond in a nitrite is weaker than the aryl $\\mathrm{C-N}$ bond in a nitroarene.\n    4.  Resonance delocalization can stabilize cations like $\\mathrm{ArO^+}$ or $\\mathrm{Ar^+}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically sound. The compounds, nitrobenzene ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5NO_2}$) and phenyl nitrite ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5ONO}$), are valid chemical structures. The molecular weight for $\\mathrm{C_6H_5NO_2}$ is approximately $6 \\times 12.01 + 5 \\times 1.01 + 1 \\times 14.01 + 2 \\times 16.00 = 123.11 \\text{ u}$, confirming the molecular ion at $m/z=123$.

The provided principles are sufficient to deduce a unique and logical answer.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unbiased scientific language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with no internal contradictions or missing information. The solution process can now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will focus on the expected primary fragmentation pathways for the molecular ions of nitrobenzene and phenyl nitrite, both having $m/z=123$.\n\n**1. Fragmentation of Nitrobenzene ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5NO_2}$)**\n\nThe molecular ion is $[\\mathrm{C_6H_5NO_2}]^{+\\cdot}$ with $m/z=123$.\n\n-   **Pathway I: Loss of $\\mathrm{NO_2}\\cdot$.** This involves the homolytic cleavage of the aryl $\\mathrm{C-N}$ bond.\n    $$[\\mathrm{C_6H_5NO_2}]^{+\\cdot} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C_6H_5^+} + \\mathrm{NO_2}\\cdot$$\n    This fragmentation produces the phenyl cation, $\\mathrm{C_6H_5^+}$, at $m/z = (6 \\times 12) + (5 \\times 1) = 77$. The neutral loss is the nitrogen dioxide radical, $\\mathrm{NO_2}\\cdot$, with a mass of $14 + (2 \\times 16) = 46 \\text{ u}$. This results in a diagnostic peak at $m/z=77$, which corresponds to $[M-46]^+$. The presence of a significant peak at $m/z=77$ is highly characteristic of nitroarenes.\n\n-   **Pathway II: Loss of $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$.** This is a more complex pathway that requires an intramolecular rearrangement known as the nitro-nitrite rearrangement, where the molecular ion isomerizes to a nitrite-like structure before fragmentation.\n    $$[\\mathrm{C_6H_5-NO_2}]^{+\\cdot} \\longrightarrow [\\mathrm{C_6H_5-O-NO}]^{+\\cdot} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C_6H_5O^+} + \\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$$\n    This fragmentation produces the phenoxy cation, $\\mathrm{C_6H_5O^+}$, at $m/z = (6 \\times 12) + (5 \\times 1) + 16 = 93$. This cation is stabilized by resonance. The neutral loss is the nitric oxide radical, $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$, with a mass of $14 + 16 = 30 \\text{ u}$. This results in a peak at $m/z=93$, which corresponds to $[M-30]^+$. For nitrobenzene, this peak is typically very intense, often the base peak.\n\n-   **Other Pathways:** Another fragmentation involves the formation of $\\mathrm{NO^+}$ at $m/z=30$.\n    $$[\\mathrm{C_6H_5-NO_2}]^{+\\cdot} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C_6H_5O}\\cdot + \\mathrm{NO^+}$$\n\n**2. Fragmentation of Phenyl Nitrite ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5ONO}$)**\n\nThe molecular ion is $[\\mathrm{C_6H_5ONO}]^{+\\cdot}$ with $m/z=123$.\n\n-   **Pathway III: Loss of $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$.** As per the provided principles, the $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond is weak. Its simple homolytic cleavage is a highly favored process.\n    $$[\\mathrm{C_6H_5-O-NO}]^{+\\cdot} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C_6H_5O^+} + \\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$$\n    This is a direct cleavage that yields the same phenoxy cation, $\\mathrm{C_6H_5O^+}$, at $m/z=93$ and the nitric oxide radical, $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$. Since this fragmentation does not require a prior rearrangement and breaks the weakest bond, the peak at $m/z=93$ ($[M-30]^+$) is expected to be extremely intense for phenyl nitrite, likely representing the vast majority of the ion current.\n\n-   **Pathway IV: Loss of the nitrite group.** This would involve cleavage of the $\\mathrm{C-O}$ bond.\n    $$[\\mathrm{C_6H_5-O-NO}]^{+\\cdot} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C_6H_5^+} + \\cdot\\mathrm{ONO}$$\n    This produces the phenyl cation at $m/z=77$ ($[M-46]^+$). However, the aryl $\\mathrm{C-O}$ bond is significantly stronger than the $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond. Therefore, this pathway is much less favorable than Pathway III, and the peak at $m/z=77$ is expected to be very weak or absent in the spectrum of phenyl nitrite.\n\n**3. Diagnostic Test Formulation**\n\nThe key difference between the two isomers lies in the relative abundances of the peaks at $m/z=77$ and $m/z=93$.\n-   **Nitrobenzene** will show significant peaks at both $m/z=77$ (from direct $\\mathrm{C-N}$ cleavage) and $m/z=93$ (from rearrangement then cleavage). The abundance of the $m/z=77$ peak is a strong indicator of the $\\mathrm{Ar-NO_2}$ structure.\n-   **Phenyl Nitrite** will show a dominant, very intense peak at $m/z=93$ (from direct cleavage of the weak $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond) and a very weak or negligible peak at $m/z=77$.\n\nTherefore, a two-feature test comparing the peaks at $m/z=77$ and $m/z=93$ is appropriate. The presence of a substantial peak at $m/z=77$ identifies the nitro isomer. An overwhelmingly dominant peak at $m/z=93$ paired with a very weak peak at $m/z=77$ identifies the nitrite isomer.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Compare $[M-46]^+$ at $m/z=77$ and $[M-30]^+$ at $m/z=93$. Assign aryl nitro when $[M-46]^+$ is abundant (loss of $\\mathrm{NO_2}\\cdot$ to give $\\mathrm{C_6H_5^+}$), and assign aryl nitrite when $[M-30]^+$ is abundant (loss of $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ to give $\\mathrm{C_6H_5O^+}$). Rationale: nitroarenes favor $\\mathrm{C-N}$ scission with charge retention on the ring to yield $\\mathrm{Ar^+}$, whereas nitrites favor $\\mathrm{O-N}$ scission with charge retention on oxygen to yield $\\mathrm{ArO^+}$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the two crucial diagnostic peaks at $m/z=77$ and $m/z=93$. The interpretation is correct: the presence of an abundant peak at $m/z=77$ is characteristic of the nitro compound. Similarly, the high abundance of the peak at $m/z=93$ is characteristic of the nitrite due to the facile cleavage of the weak $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond. The rationale provided is mechanistically sound and consistent with the principles given in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Compare only $m/z=30$ and $m/z=46$. Assign aryl nitro when $m/z=30$ ($\\mathrm{NO^+}$) exceeds $m/z=46$ ($\\mathrm{NO_2^+}$), and assign aryl nitrite when $m/z=46$ exceeds $m/z=30$. Rationale: the more “oxidized” functionality should preferentially give the higher-oxidation-state small cation.**\nThe formation of $\\mathrm{NO^+}$ ($m/z=30$) is plausible for both isomers. For the nitrite, it arises from charge retention on the $\\mathrm{NO}$ fragment during the facile $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond cleavage. For the nitro compound, it arises after rearrangement. The formation of $\\mathrm{NO_2^+}$ ($m/z=46$) is less favorable than the loss of the neutral radical $\\mathrm{NO_2}\\cdot$. Furthermore, the prediction that the nitrite would preferentially form $\\mathrm{NO_2^+}$ is mechanistically unsound; the nitrite does not contain a pre-formed $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ unit. In reality, the aryl nitrite is expected to show a much stronger $\\mathrm{NO^+}$ peak than the nitroarene. The option's prediction is the opposite of what is expected. The rationale is vague and not based on fragmentation rules.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Compare $[M-18]^+$ and $[M-28]^+$. Assign aryl nitrite when $[M-18]^+$ is strong (loss of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ from the molecular ion), and assign aryl nitro when $[M-28]^+$ is strong (loss of $\\mathrm{CO}$). Rationale: nitrites are alcohol-like and dehydrate; nitroarenes can expel $\\mathrm{CO}$ under EI.**\nLoss of water ($18 \\text{ u}$) from phenyl nitrite is not a simple or expected fragmentation pathway. The analogy that \"nitrites are alcohol-like\" is inappropriate. Loss of carbon monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$, $28 \\text{ u}$) is a known fragmentation in nitrobenzene, but it is a secondary fragmentation that occurs from the phenoxy cation at $m/z=93$, not from the molecular ion at $m/z=123$. The peak would be at $m/z=65$ ($93-28$), not $[M-28]^+$ ($m/z=95$). The proposed diagnostic features are not primary or major fragmentation products as described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Compare $[M-30]^+$ and $m/z=46$. Assign aryl nitrite when $[M-30]^+$ is weak and $m/z=46$ is strong, and assign aryl nitro when $[M-30]^+$ is strong and $m/z=46$ is weak. Rationale: the $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond is strong, so nitrites resist loss of $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ and instead produce $\\mathrm{NO_2^+}$.**\nThe rationale in this option (\"the $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond is strong\") directly contradicts a fundamental principle stated in the problem (\"The $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond in nitrite esters is typically weaker...\"). Based on this alone, the option is invalid. Furthermore, its predictions are wrong: aryl nitrite should show a very strong $[M-30]^+$ peak ($m/z=93$) due to the weak $\\mathrm{O-N}$ bond, not a weak one. It also incorrectly predicts a strong $\\mathrm{NO_2^+}$ ($m/z=46$) peak for the nitrite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The observed cancellation for both labels, together with the HRMS exact neutral-loss mass, assigns $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ as the $30\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ loss.\n\nB. Rely on nominal mass alone to classify any $30\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ neutral loss as $\\mathrm{NO}$ and confirm by $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ labeling of the nitro group that both $m([M]^{+})$ and $m([M-30]^{+})$ increase by $+1\\,\\mathrm{Da}$; interpret the $+1\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ fragment shift as proof of $\\mathrm{NO}$ loss.\n\nC. Use HRMS to determine that $m_{\\text{loss}} = 30.010565 \\pm 0.000150\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ and conclude that formaldehyde loss from a side chain is a surrogate for $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ loss.

It is based on the core principles of mass spectrometry: the direct measurement of mass-to-charge ratios (HRMS) and the use of isotopic tracers to elucidate reaction mechanisms (fragmentation pathways). The distinction between isobaric species using exact mass is a cornerstone of HRMS. The logic of mass shifts upon isotope labeling is a standard and powerful analytical technique.

The goal is well-defined, and a unique, logical solution is attainable from the provided information.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology. It explicitly requires a solution based on quantitative facts.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to proceed to a solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Experimental Plan\n\nA definitive plan must use the two complementary techniques provided: HRMS and isotope labeling.\n\n**Part 1: High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS)**\nHRMS distinguishes chemical formulas of the same nominal mass by measuring their exact masses to high precision. The objective is to differentiate the neutral loss $\\mathrm{NO \\cdot}$ from $\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{6} \\cdot$.\n\n-   Theoretical exact mass of $\\mathrm{NO}$: $m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 14.003074\\,\\mathrm{Da} + 15.994915\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 29.997989\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\n-   Theoretical exact mass of $\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{6}$: $m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}_{2}{}^{1}\\mathrm{H}_{6}) = 2 \\times 12.000000\\,\\mathrm{Da} + 6 \\times 1.007825\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 24.000000\\,\\mathrm{Da} + 6.046950\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 30.046950\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\nThe mass difference between these two potential neutral losses is:\n$\\Delta m = m(\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{6}) - m(\\mathrm{NO}) = 30.046950\\,\\mathrm{Da} - 29.997989\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 0.048961\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\n\nThe specified HRMS accuracy is $5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ at $m/z \\approx 30$. The uncertainty in a mass measurement $(\\delta m)$ is:\n$\\delta m = (\\text{accuracy}) \\times (\\text{mass}) = (5 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 30\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 0.000150\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\nSince the mass difference $\\Delta m = 0.048961\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ is substantially larger than the instrumental uncertainty ($0.048961 \\gg 0.000150$), HRMS can easily and unambiguously distinguish between these two neutral losses.\nThe experimental procedure would be to measure the exact mass of the molecular ion, $m([M]^{+})$, and the fragment ion, $m([M-30]^{+})$, and calculate the exact mass of the neutral loss: $m_{\\text{loss}} = m([M]^{+}) - m([M-30]^{+})$. If the result is within $29.997989 \\pm 0.000150\\,\\mathrm{Da}$, the loss is confirmed as $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$.\n\n**Part 2: Isotope Labeling**\nIsotope labeling provides an independent, mechanistic confirmation. We label the nitro group, the putative source of the $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ loss, and observe the effect on the fragment ion mass.\n\nLet $m([M]^{+})$ be the mass of the unlabeled molecular ion and $m(F^{+})$ be the mass of the resulting fragment ion, $m(F^{+}) = m([M]^{+}) - m(N)$, where $N$ is the neutral loss.\nLet $m([M^{*}]^{+})$ be the mass of the labeled molecular ion. The mass shift is $\\Delta m_{\\text{label}} = m([M^{*}]^{+}) - m([M]^{+})$.\n\n**Case 1: The neutral loss is $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ (label is expelled).**\nThe label ($^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ or $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$) is placed in the nitro group. The neutral loss is now $N^{*}$, containing the label.\n-   $m(N^{*}) = m(N) + \\Delta m_{\\text{label}}$.\n-   The new fragment mass, $m((F^{*})^{+})$, is:\n    $$m((F^{*})^{+}) = m([M^{*}]^{+}) - m(N^{*})$$\n    $$m((F^{*})^{+}) = (m([M]^{+}) + \\Delta m_{\\text{label}}) - (m(N) + \\Delta m_{\\text{label}})$$\n    $$m((F^{*})^{+}) = m([M]^{+}) - m(N) = m(F^{+})$$\n-   **Prediction:** The mass of the fragment ion will remain unchanged (invariant) upon labeling.\n\n**Case 2: The neutral loss is $\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\cdot$ (label is retained).**\nThe label ($^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ or $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$) is in the nitro group, which is not part of the alkyl radical loss. The neutral loss $N$ does not contain the label, so $m(N^{*}) = m(N)$.\n-   The new fragment mass, $m((F^{*})^{+})$, is:\n    $$m((F^{*})^{+}) = m([M^{*}]^{+}) - m(N^{*})$$\n    $$m((F^{*})^{+}) = (m([M]^{+}) + \\Delta m_{\\text{label}}) - m(N)$$\n    $$m((F^{*})^{+}) = (m([M]^{+}) - m(N)) + \\Delta m_{\\text{label}} = m(F^{+}) + \\Delta m_{\\text{label}}$$\n-   **Prediction:** The mass of the fragment ion will increase by the exact mass of the isotopic label.\n\nTherefore, a conclusive plan involves both HRMS measurement of the neutral loss and confirmation via isotope labeling experiments ($^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ and $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$), where the latter should show no shift in the fragment ion mass if the loss is indeed $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Measure $m([M]^{+})$ and $m([M-30]^{+})$ by HRMS, compute $m_{\\text{loss}} = m([M]^{+}) - m([M-30]^{+})$, and require $m_{\\text{loss}} = 29.997989 \\pm 0.000150\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ (within $5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ of $\\mathrm{NO}$), thereby excluding $30.010565\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ and $30.046950\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. Then synthesize a version with $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ only in the nitro group: verify $m([M]^{+})$ shifts by $+0.997035\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ while $m([M-30]^{+})$ remains invariant within $0.0005\\,\\mathrm{Da}$, consistent with $m_{\\text{loss}}^{*} = m(\\,^{15}\\mathrm{N}^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\,)$ increasing by $+0.997035\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ and canceling in the fragment. Repeat with $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ in the nitro group: verify $m([M]^{+})$ shifts by $+2.004245\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ while $m([M-30]^{+})$ remains invariant within $0.0005\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. The observed cancellation for both labels, together with the HRMS exact neutral-loss mass, assigns $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ as the $30\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ loss.**\n\nThis option perfectly aligns with our derived definitive plan. It correctly uses HRMS with the proper uncertainty calculation. It correctly predicts the outcome of the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ and $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ labeling experiments for an $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ loss, stating that the fragment ion mass should remain invariant. The reasoning provided for this invariance (\"canceling in the fragment\") is also correct. The combination of both techniques provides a conclusive assignment as required.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Rely on nominal mass alone to classify any $30\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ neutral loss as $\\mathrm{NO}$ and confirm by $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ labeling of the nitro group that both $m([M]^{+})$ and $m([M-30]^{+})$ increase by $+1\\,\\mathrm{Da}$; interpret the $+1\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ fragment shift as proof of $\\mathrm{NO}$ loss.**\n\nThis option has multiple flaws. First, it relies on nominal mass ($30\\,\\mathrm{Da}$), which is explicitly forbidden by the problem's emphasis on quantitative discrimination. Second, it incorrectly predicts that the fragment ion mass $m([M-30]^{+})$ will increase. As derived, for an $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ loss, the fragment mass must be invariant. An increase would prove the label was retained, refuting an $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ loss. Finally, it uses the approximate nominal shift of $+1\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ instead of the provided exact mass shifts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use HRMS to determine that $m_{\\text{loss}} = 30.010565 \\pm 0.000150\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ and conclude that formaldehyde loss from a side chain is a surrogate for $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ loss. Confirm by $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ labeling of the nitro group that $m([M-30]^{+})$ increases by $+2.004245\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.**\n\nThis option is flawed. It aims to prove the loss of formaldehyde ($\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$), which is not the objective. The objective is to prove the loss is $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$. Furthermore, the concept of one neutral loss being a \"surrogate\" for another is scientifically meaningless in this context. While the prediction that the fragment mass would shift upon $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ labeling is consistent with a non-nitro-group loss, the option's premise and conclusion are entirely misdirected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Perform $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ and $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ labeling of the nitro group and require that $m([M-30]^{+})$ shifts by $+0.997035\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ and $+2.004245\\,\\mathrm{Da}$, respectively, matching the molecular ion shifts. Use this retention of label in the fragment as diagnostic for $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ loss without needing HRMS of the neutral loss.**\n\nThis option makes a prediction that is the exact opposite of the correct one. It states that the fragment ion mass $m([M-30]^{+})$ should shift by the full mass of the label. This outcome would only occur if the labeled atoms ($^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ or $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$) were retained in the fragment ion. This would be definitive proof *against* an $\\mathrm{NO}\\cdot$ loss from the nitro group and in favor of a loss like $\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\cdot$. The interpretation is fundamentally wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
