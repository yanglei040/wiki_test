There is no choice of $U \\neq 0$ that yields simultaneous bounded motion in both $x$ and $y$. Therefore, in the long-analyzer limit where transverse unbounded growth leads to rod collisions, the DC-only transmission is effectively zero:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{DC}} = 0.\n$$\n\n2.

In a quadrupole mass analyzer, true mass selection arises from the existence of a narrow, controllable stability region in the $(a,q)$ parameter plane. The RF component ($q \\neq 0$) supplies dynamic focusing and establishes stability bands; the DC component ($a \\neq 0$) shifts the operating point differently in the $x$ and $y$ directions because $a_{y} = -a_{x}$, thereby allowing a trajectory in $(a,q)$ space that intersects the first stability region only for a specific range of $m/z$. By synchronously scanning $U$ and $V$ at fixed ratio, one traces a line in $(a,q)$ whose intersection with the stability tongue selects a single $m/z$ while rendering others unstable in at least one transverse direction, effecting mass filtration. In contrast, RF-only ($a=0$) produces a broad, non-selective passband for all sufficiently heavy ions ($m \\geq m_{c}$), and DC-only ($q=0$) cannot produce simultaneous stability in both transverse directions due to the static saddle potential dictated by Laplace’s equation. Hence, both DC and RF are jointly required to create a tunable, selective stability window that underlies quadrupole mass filtering.",

            "problem": "An organic mass spectrometry laboratory operates a commercial Quadrupole Mass Filter (QMF) to identify unknowns in complex mixtures. The QMF has fixed rod radius and a fixed drive angular frequency, and the operator can adjust three classes of controls during tune: ion lens voltages upstream and downstream of the QMF, the Direct Current (DC) to Radio Frequency (RF) ratio applied to the rods (expressed as the $U/V$ ratio, where $U$ is the DC and $V$ is the RF amplitude), and the RF amplitude range itself. The instrument is used with a Perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) calibrant that provides strong reference peaks spanning from $m/z$ $100$ to $m/z$ $1000$. The lab’s performance target is unit mass resolution, defined operationally as Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) equal to $1$ Th at each anchor mass, while maximizing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and maintaining a relatively flat response across $m/z$ $100$ to $m/z$ $1000$.\n\nSelect the single autotune procedure below that is most consistent with the dynamical principles governing ion motion in a quadrupole, the trade-off between resolution and transmission, and the way mass range is set by the RF amplitude under a fixed drive frequency.

Adjust entrance and exit lens voltages to maximize transmitted ion current without inducing peak shape asymmetry. Step $2$: Enable mass-resolving mode and, at the same mid-mass anchor, vary the $U/V$ ratio to achieve unit resolution (FWHM $=1$ Th) while keeping peak height as high as possible, using only minimal compensating tweaks to the ion lens voltages to preserve transmission. Step $3$: Increase the available RF amplitude range so that scanning $V$ with the chosen $U/V$ covers up to $m/z$ $1000$, and verify that scanning down with the same $U/V$ reaches $m/z$ $100$. If resolution deviates at the low or high anchor, slightly refine the $U/V$ ratio to equalize FWHM at the anchors without moving far from the mid-mass working point. Step $4$: Iterate ion lens voltages at $m/z$ $100$, $m/z$ $500$, and $m/z$ $1000$ to flatten the response (e.g., within $\\pm 20\\%$) while confirming FWHM $=1$ Th at each anchor.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a standard task in analytical chemistry: tuning a Quadrupole Mass Filter (QMF) for optimal performance across a wide mass range. The performance goals are unit mass resolution, maximized signal-to-noise ratio, and a flat response curve. The available controls are ion lens voltages, the DC/RF voltage ratio ($U/V$), and the RF amplitude ($V$). To validate the proposed tuning procedures, we must first recall the fundamental principles of ion motion in a QMF.\n\nThe stability of an ion's trajectory in a quadrupole field is determined by the Mathieu stability parameters, $a$ and $q$:\n$$ a = \\frac{8eU}{m \\omega^2 r_0^2} $$\n$$ q = \\frac{4eV}{m \\omega^2 r_0^2} $$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $m$ is the ion mass, $U$ is the DC potential, $V$ is the zero-to-peak RF amplitude, $\\omega$ is the RF angular frequency, and $r_0$ is the rod radius. For a given instrument, $\\omega$ and $r_0$ are fixed constants.\n\nAn ion is transmitted through the filter only if its $(a, q)$ coordinates fall within a specific region of stability on the $a-q$ diagram. In a typical mass scan, the ratio $U/V$ is held constant. This defines a linear \"scan line\" or \"operating line\" on the $a-q$ diagram with a slope given by:\n$$ \\frac{a}{q} = \\frac{8eU / (m \\omega^2 r_0^2)}{4eV / (m \\omega^2 r_0^2)} = \\frac{2U}{V} $$\nTo scan for different masses, both $U$ and $V$ are swept linearly with time while their ratio is maintained. From the equation for $q$, it is clear that for a given point on the scan line, the transmitted mass $m$ is directly proportional to the applied RF amplitude $V$.\n\nThe key trade-off in a QMF is between resolution and transmission. The tip of the main stability region is located at approximately $(a, q) \\approx (0.237, 0.706)$. As the operating line (controlled by the $U/V$ ratio) is moved closer to this tip, the range of stable $m/z$ values for a given $(U,V)$ setting becomes narrower, leading to higher mass resolution. However, this also reduces the number of ions that have stable trajectories, thus decreasing transmission and signal intensity.\n\nAn important operational mode is the RF-only mode, where $U = 0$. This sets $a = 0$, and the operating line is the $q$-axis. In this mode, all ions with $q < 0.908$ are transmitted. This makes the quadrupole a high-pass mass filter, transmitting all ions above a certain mass cutoff. This mode offers the highest possible ion transmission and is ideal for preliminary tuning of ion optics (lenses) to maximize ion current through the system without the confounding factor of mass resolution.\n\nBased on these principles, a logical tuning procedure follows a hierarchical approach:\n1.  Optimize overall ion transport efficiency by maximizing ion current through the device. This is best done in RF-only mode ($U=0$) by adjusting ion lens voltages.\n2.  Establish the desired mass resolution by adjusting the $U/V$ ratio, which controls the trade-off with transmission. This is typically done at a representative mass in the middle of the desired range.\n3.  Set the mass scan range by defining the scan limits of the RF amplitude $V$.\n4.  Verify performance (resolution, signal) at the low and high ends of the mass range and make fine adjustments to the $U/V$ ratio and lens voltages to ensure consistent performance and a flat response across the entire range.\n\nNow we evaluate each option against this framework.\n\n**A. Step $1$: Place the QMF in RF-only mode by setting $U=0$. Inject PFTBA and select a mid-mass anchor (e.g., $m/z$ $502$). Adjust entrance and exit lens voltages to maximize transmitted ion current without inducing peak shape asymmetry. Step $2$: Enable mass-resolving mode and, at the same mid-mass anchor, vary the $U/V$ ratio to achieve unit resolution (FWHM $=1$ Th) while keeping peak height as high as possible, using only minimal compensating tweaks to the ion lens voltages to preserve transmission. Step $3$: Increase the available RF amplitude range so that scanning $V$ with the chosen $U/V$ covers up to $m/z$ $1000$, and verify that scanning down with the same $U/V$ reaches $m/z$ $100$. If resolution deviates at the low or high anchor, slightly refine the $U/V$ ratio to equalize FWHM at the anchors without moving far from the mid-mass working point. Step $4$: Iterate ion lens voltages at $m/z$ $100$, $m/z$ $500$, and $m/z$ $1000$ to flatten the response (e.g., within $\\pm 20\\%$) while confirming FWHM $=1$ Th at each anchor. Step $5$: Save the $U/V$ ratio and RF amplitude scan limits; if supported, store minor mass-dependent lens offsets via interpolation to maintain flat response across $m/z$ $100$ to $m/z$ $1000$.**\nThis procedure is entirely consistent with first principles. Step 1 correctly uses RF-only mode to optimize ion transport, which is the logical first step. Step 2 correctly uses the $U/V$ ratio to set the resolution at a representative mid-mass. Step 3 correctly establishes the mass range via the RF amplitude $V$ and includes the crucial step of verifying and refining the $U/V$ ratio at the extremes of the mass range. Steps 4 and 5 describe the final refinement process to flatten the mass response, which addresses a key performance goal and reflects modern instrument capabilities. The entire sequence is logical, hierarchical, and physically sound.\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Step $1$: Set the RF amplitude to its maximum to guarantee access to $m/z$ $1000$ immediately. Step $2$: Keep $U=0$ to maximize transmission and adjust ion lens voltages at $m/z$ $1000$ until the signal is maximized. Step $3$: After lens tuning, set $U/V=0$ during acquisition to maintain the widest pass band and rely on downstream electronics to recover unit resolution by deconvolution.**\nThis procedure is fundamentally flawed. Step 3 states that acquisition is performed with $U/V=0$, which implies $U=0$. This is RF-only mode, which is not a mass-resolving mode. It functions as a high-pass filter. The instrument would not produce resolved mass peaks. The claim that unit resolution can be recovered from such data via deconvolution is scientifically unsound. Deconvolution can improve existing resolution but cannot create it from a non-selective ion beam.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Step $1$: Begin in mass-resolving mode by setting a very small $U/V$ ratio to broaden transmission. Step $2$: Optimize ion lens voltages only at low mass (e.g., $m/z$ $100$) to maximize signal. Step $3$: Set a moderate RF amplitude and program a dynamic scan in which $U/V$ is varied during the scan to keep the stability parameter $q$ constant across $m/z$ $100$ to $m/z$ $1000$ so that the resolution remains unchanged without further iteration.**\nThis procedure contains multiple errors. Step 3 proposes to keep the parameter $q$ constant during a scan. This contradicts the fundamental principle of a mass scan. In a scan, $V$ is swept to transmit different masses. Since $q \\propto V/m$, for a fixed ion mass $m$, $q$ necessarily changes as $V$ changes. Moreover, for a fixed RF amplitude $V$, different masses $m$ will have different $q$ values. It is impossible to keep $q$ constant for all masses across a range. A constant $U/V$ ratio, not a constant $q$, is what leads to (theoretically) constant resolution $\\Delta m$. The procedure is based on a misunderstanding of quadrupole physics.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Step $1$: Immediately set a large $U/V$ ratio to place the operating line at the apex of the stability boundary and thus maximize resolution. Step $2$: Use minimal RF amplitude so that only $m/z$ near $1000$ are transmitted and tune ion lens voltages while resolving $m/z$ $1000$ exclusively. Step $3$: After high-mass tuning is complete, reduce the RF amplitude further to bring lower masses ($m/z$ $100$ to $m/z$ $500$) into range without changing $U/V$.**\nThis approach is impractical. Setting the operating line at the apex (Step 1) yields theoretically infinite resolution but near-zero transmission. It is extremely difficult to tune an instrument with almost no signal. The correct approach is to set the resolution to the desired target (FWHM = $1$ Th), not the theoretical maximum. Furthermore, tuning all parameters only at the high-mass extreme (Step 2) will likely lead to poor performance and severe mass discrimination at lower masses. This is an inefficient and logically flawed strategy.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Step $1$: Enter mass-resolving mode and adjust $U/V$ at $m/z$ $100$ until FWHM $=1$ Th is achieved. Step $2$: Increase RF amplitude until $m/z$ $1000$ is reachable when scanning. Step $3$: Freeze $U/V$ permanently and do not iterate it thereafter; instead, optimize ion lens voltages at $m/z$ $100$ only, and assume the same settings will ensure unit resolution and flat response across $m/z$ $100$ to $m/z$ $1000$.**\nThis procedure is naive. The central flaw is in Step 3, which assumes that settings for resolution ($U/V$) and ion lenses optimized at a single low mass ($m/z$ $100$) will hold perfectly across a wide $10 \\times$ mass range. In any real-world instrument, non-ideal fields and fringing effects cause both resolution and transmission efficiency to vary with mass. A robust tuning procedure must verify and adjust parameters at multiple points across the mass range to meet the goals of consistent resolution and a flat response. This procedure fails to do so.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nIn summary, only procedure A describes a comprehensive, physically correct, and practical method for tuning a quadrupole mass filter to meet the specified performance criteria.",

The force on a charge $z e$ is $\\mathbf{F} = -z e \\nabla \\Phi$. Along the $x$-axis, Newton’s second law $m \\, d^{2}x/dt^{2} = F_{x}$ gives\n$$\nm \\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + \\frac{2 z e}{r_{0}^{2}} \\left[ U + V \\cos(\\Omega t) \\right] x = 0.\n$$\nWith the substitution $\\xi = \\Omega t/2$ and using $d^{2}x/dt^{2} = (\\Omega^{2}/4) d^{2}x/d\\xi^{2}$, this becomes the Mathieu equation\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}x}{d\\xi^{2}} + \\left( a_{x} - 2 q_{x} \\cos 2 \\xi \\right) x = 0,\n$$\nwith parameters\n$$\na_{x} = \\frac{4 z e U}{m r_{0}^{2} \\Omega^{2}}, \\qquad q_{x} = \\frac{2 z e V}{m r_{0}^{2} \\Omega^{2}}.\n$$\nOperation of the quadrupole as a mass filter selects ions whose $(a_{x}, q_{x})$ lie within the first stability region of the Mathieu stability diagram. In a conventional scan, the instrument maintains a fixed ratio $\\kappa = U/V$, so that\n$$\n\\frac{a_{x}}{q_{x}} = \\frac{4 z e U/(m r_{0}^{2} \\Omega^{2})}{2 z e V/(m r_{0}^{2} \\Omega^{2})} = 2 \\frac{U}{V} = 2 \\kappa,\n$$\nwhich is constant during the scan. Thus, as $V$ is ramped, the operating point traces a line of constant $a_{x}/q_{x}$ in the $(a_{x}, q_{x})$ plane and intersects a characteristic point on the first stability boundary at a fixed value $q_{x}^{\\star}$ determined solely by $\\kappa$ and the chosen tip of the stability region. The transmission condition along this line implies\n$$\nq_{x} = q_{x}^{\\star} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\frac{2 z e V}{m r_{0}^{2} \\Omega^{2}} = q_{x}^{\\star}.\n$$\nSolving for $m/z$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{2 e}{r_{0}^{2} \\Omega^{2} q_{x}^{\\star}} \\, V \\equiv \\eta V,\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is a constant for a given instrument and $\\kappa$. In practice, small offsets in the RF amplitude readout, finite rise times, and fringing field effects introduce an effective affine correction, so the empirical mapping during a scan is well modeled as\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z} = \\alpha V + \\beta,\n$$\nwith $\\alpha \\approx \\eta$ and $\\beta$ absorbing systematic offsets.\n\nWe now determine $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ from three calibration points acquired during a linear RF ramp $V(t) = V_{\\text{start}} + s t$ with $V_{\\text{start}} = 100.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $s = 2.00 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{V\\,s^{-1}}$. The three calibrants are singly charged, so the provided $m/z$ values equal $m/z$ in $\\mathrm{Th}$.\n\nFirst compute the RF amplitudes at the three detection times:\n- For $t_{1} = 0.011000\\,\\mathrm{s}$,\n$$\nV_{1} = V_{\\text{start}} + s t_{1} = 100.0 + (2.00 \\times 10^{4})(0.011000) = 100.0 + 220.0 = 320.0 \\ \\mathrm{V}.\n$$\n- For $t_{2} = 0.048500\\,\\mathrm{s}$,\n$$\nV_{2} = 100.0 + (2.00 \\times 10^{4})(0.048500) = 100.0 + 970.0 = 1070.0 \\ \\mathrm{V}.\n$$\n- For $t_{3} = 0.119250\\,\\mathrm{s}$,\n$$\nV_{3} = 100.0 + (2.00 \\times 10^{4})(0.119250) = 100.0 + 2385.0 = 2485.0 \\ \\mathrm{V}.\n$$\n\nThe corresponding $m/z$ values (in $\\mathrm{Th}$) are $m_{1} = 69.000$, $m_{2} = 219.000$, and $m_{3} = 502.000$. Fit the affine model $m = \\alpha V + \\beta$ by least squares. With $N = 3$ data points, the normal-equations solution is\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{i} m_{i} - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{i} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} \\right)}{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{i}^{2} - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{i} \\right)^{2}}, \\qquad\n\\beta = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i} - \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{i}}{N}.\n$$\nCompute the required sums:\n$$\n\\sum V_{i} = 320.0 + 1070.0 + 2485.0 = 3875.0,\n$$\n$$\n\\sum V_{i}^{2} = (320.0)^{2} + (1070.0)^{2} + (2485.0)^{2} = 102400.0 + 1144900.0 + 6175225.0 = 7422525.0,\n$$\n$$\n\\sum m_{i} = 69.000 + 219.000 + 502.000 = 790.000,\n$$\n$$\n\\sum V_{i} m_{i} = (320.0)(69.000) + (1070.0)(219.000) + (2485.0)(502.000) = 22080.0 + 234330.0 + 1247470.0 = 1503880.0.\n$$\nThen\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{3(1503880.0) - (3875.0)(790.000)}{3(7422525.0) - (3875.0)^{2}} = \\frac{4511640.0 - 3061250.0}{22267575.0 - 15015625.0} = \\frac{1450390.0}{7251950.0} = 0.200000,\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{790.000 - (0.200000)(3875.0)}{3} = \\frac{790.000 - 775.000}{3} = \\frac{15.0000}{3} = 5.00000.\n$$\n\nThus, to six significant figures, the calibrated mapping coefficients are $\\alpha = 0.200000\\,\\mathrm{Th\\,V^{-1}}$ and $\\beta = 5.00000\\,\\mathrm{Th}$, yielding the affine relationship $m/z = \\alpha V + \\beta$ during the scan when $V$ is expressed in $\\mathrm{V}$ and $m/z$ in $\\mathrm{Th}$.",
