            "problem": "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) of hydrophobic small molecules relies on forming analyte–matrix co-crystals with sufficiently homogeneous spatial distribution to ensure reproducible ion yields across laser shots.

The physical scenario, including the specific matrix (CHCA), solvent system, and analyte properties, is realistic. The provided numerical values for velocities, lengths, and the diffusion coefficient are physically plausible for microscale fluid dynamics during droplet evaporation. The problem is well-posed: it provides a clear, quantitative criterion ($Pe \\lesssim 1$) and all necessary data to evaluate the three methods against this criterion, leading to a unique conclusion. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not exhibit any of the defined flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of three MALDI sample preparation methods based on their expected homogeneity. The governing principle provided is that homogeneity is favored when the Péclet number, $Pe$, is low (specifically, $Pe \\lesssim 1$). The Péclet number, defined as $Pe = \\frac{vL}{D}$, represents the ratio of the rate of advection (bulk flow) to the rate of diffusion. A low $Pe$ indicates that diffusion can effectively counteract the advective flow that would otherwise concentrate the analyte at the droplet's edge, thus promoting a more uniform solid deposit.\n\nWe will calculate the Péclet number for each method using the provided values for the average velocity $v$, characteristic length $L$, and the analyte diffusion coefficient $D \\approx 3 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. The method yielding the lowest $Pe$ will be the one expected to produce the most homogeneous co-crystals.\n\n1.  **Dried-droplet method ($Pe_{\\mathrm{dd}}$):**\n    Using $v_{\\mathrm{dd}} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{m} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{dd}} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{m}$:\n    $$Pe_{\\mathrm{dd}} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{dd}} L_{\\mathrm{dd}}}{D} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{m} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{m})}{3 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}}$$\n    $$Pe_{\\mathrm{dd}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{3 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-7}}{3 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{1000}{3} \\approx 333$$\n    Since $Pe_{\\mathrm{dd}} \\gg 1$, advection strongly dominates, leading to significant peripheral accumulation and poor homogeneity.\n\n2.  **Thin-layer (precoat) method ($Pe_{\\mathrm{tl}}$):**\n    Using $v_{\\mathrm{tl}} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{tl}} \\approx 1 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}$:\n    $$Pe_{\\mathrm{tl}} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{tl}} L_{\\mathrm{tl}}}{D} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m})}{3 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}}$$\n    $$Pe_{\\mathrm{tl}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-11} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{3 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2}{30} \\approx 0.067$$\n    Since $Pe_{\\mathrm{tl}} \\lesssim 1$, diffusion is effective at counteracting advection over the short characteristic length scales, leading to good homogeneity.\n\n3.  **Sandwich method ($Pe_{\\mathrm{sw}}$):**\n    Using $v_{\\mathrm{sw}} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{sw}} \\approx 2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{m}$:\n    $$Pe_{\\mathrm{sw}} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{sw}} L_{\\mathrm{sw}}}{D} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{m})}{3 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}}$$\n    $$Pe_{\\mathrm{sw}} = \\frac{12.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{3 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{125}{3} \\approx 41.7$$\n    Since $Pe_{\\mathrm{sw}} \\gg 1$, advection still dominates, leading to inhomogeneous co-crystallization.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion**\nComparing the calculated Péclet numbers:\n- $Pe_{\\mathrm{dd}} \\approx 333$\n- $Pe_{\\mathrm{tl}} \\approx 0.067$\n- $Pe_{\\mathrm{sw}} \\approx 41.7$\n\nThe thin-layer method has a Péclet number significantly less than $1$, while the other two methods have Péclet numbers significantly greater than $1$. Therefore, according to the stated criterion, the thin-layer method is expected to yield the most homogeneous analyte–matrix co-crystals.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Dried-droplet method**: This method yields the highest Péclet number ($Pe_{\\mathrm{dd}} \\approx 333$), indicating the most severe advection-dominated transport. This leads to the strongest coffee-ring effect and, consequently, the least homogeneous sample deposition. **Incorrect**.\n\nB. **Thin-layer (precoat) method**: This method yields the lowest Péclet number ($Pe_{\\mathrm{tl}} \\approx 0.067$), which satisfies the condition $Pe \\lesssim 1$ for diffusion-dominated transport. The physical mechanism is that the precoated matrix bed provides a high density of nucleation sites and its porous structure both reduces the bulk fluid velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{tl}}$) and shortens the effective transport length ($L_{\\mathrm{tl}}$) over which diffusion must compete with advection. This combination leads to the most homogeneous analyte distribution. **Correct**.\n\nC. **Sandwich (matrix–analyte–matrix) method**: This method results in a Péclet number ($Pe_{\\mathrm{sw}} \\approx 41.7$) that is intermediate between the dried-droplet and thin-layer methods. While it offers an improvement over the simple dried-droplet method, its $Pe$ value is still much greater than $1$, implying that advective transport and consequent inhomogeneity remain significant. It is not the *most* homogeneous method. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. **All three are essentially equivalent if the laser fluence is properly tuned**: This statement is flawed on two counts. First, it contradicts the problem's constraint to evaluate the methods \"without assuming any special laser fluence adjustment.\" Second, it conflates sample preparation with the subsequent laser desorption/ionization event. Laser fluence affects which part of the sample is desorbed and how efficiently it is ionized, but it cannot alter the pre-existing spatial distribution of analyte and matrix crystals formed during solvent evaporation. Inhomogeneity is a characteristic of the sample preparation method itself. **Incorrect**.",

Protonation of the analyte $\\mathrm{A}$:\n    $$ \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{AH}^{+} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{1} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{prot}}(\\mathrm{A}) = -G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) $$\n2.

The target reaction has $\\mathrm{MH}^{+}$ as a reactant and $\\mathrm{M}$ as a product. This requires us to reverse reaction $(2)$:\n\nReverse of reaction $(2)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MH}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} $$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change for this reversed reaction, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{-2}$, is the negative of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{2}$:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{-2} = -(\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{2}) = -(-G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M})) = G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M}) $$\n\nNow, we add reaction $(1)$ and the reversed reaction $(2)$:\n$$ (\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}) + (\\mathrm{MH}^{+}) \\rightarrow (\\mathrm{AH}^{+}) + (\\mathrm{M} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}) $$\nThe proton, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, appears on both sides of the equation and can be canceled, yielding the target reaction:\n$$ \\mathrm{MH}^{+} + \\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M} + \\mathrm{AH}^{+} $$\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, for this target reaction is the sum of the Gibbs free energies of the constituent steps:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{1} + \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{-2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of gas-phase basicities:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) + G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M}) $$\nThus, the derived expression is:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M}) - G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) $$\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ using the given numerical values:\n$G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M}) = 844.56\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) = 878.03\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = 844.56\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} - 878.03\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -33.47\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe result $-33.47$ contains four significant figures, as requested.\n\nFinally, we explain the thermodynamic significance of this result. The standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, is related to the equilibrium constant, $K$, by the equation $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe calculated value of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is $-33.47\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, which is negative. A negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ signifies that the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction under standard conditions.

The analyte $\\mathrm{A}$ has a higher gas-phase basicity ($G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{A}) > G_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mathrm{M})$), which means it has a stronger affinity for a proton in the gas phase compared to the matrix $\\mathrm{M}$. Consequently, in the MALDI plume, collisions between $\\mathrm{MH}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{A}$ will efficiently lead to the formation of protonated analyte, $\\mathrm{AH}^{+}$. The significant negative magnitude of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ suggests a strong thermodynamic drive for this proton transfer, leading to a high yield of $\\mathrm{AH}^{+}$ ions relative to any remaining $\\mathrm{MH}^{+}$ ions or other matrix-related adducts. This is a desired outcome in MALDI for the effective analysis of the analyte.",

The molar mass of the styrene monomer ($C_8H_8$) is approximately $8 \\times 12.011 + 8 \\times 1.008 = 104.152 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, which confirms the identity of the polymer and the chemical consistency of the data. The assumptions provided are standard simplifications for this type of problem.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. All necessary data, constants, and definitions for calculating $M_n$, $M_w$, and PDI are provided. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe number-average molar mass ($M_n$) and weight-average molar mass ($M_w$) for a discrete distribution of polymer chains are defined as:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i}$$\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i M_i}{\\sum_i w_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i (N_i M_i) M_i}{\\sum_i N_i M_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i N_i M_i}$$\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of molecules of molar mass $M_i$, and $w_i = N_i M_i$ is the total weight of molecules of molar mass $M_i$.\n\nThe problem states that the integrated peak intensity $I_i$ is proportional to the number of molecules $N_i$. Therefore, we can write $N_i = k I_i$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. Substituting this into the definitions for $M_n$ and $M_w$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i (k I_i) M_i}{\\sum_i (k I_i)} = \\frac{k \\sum_i I_i M_i}{k \\sum_i I_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i I_i M_i}{\\sum_i I_i}$$\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i (k I_i) M_i^2}{\\sum_i (k I_i) M_i} = \\frac{k \\sum_i I_i M_i^2}{k \\sum_i I_i M_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i I_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i I_i M_i}$$\nThe constant $k$ cancels, allowing the intensities $I_i$ to be used directly in place of $N_i$.\n\nThe first step is to determine the neutral molar mass $M_i$ for each peak from the measured mass-to-charge ratio $(m/z)_i$. Since all ions are singly charged ($z=1$) sodium adducts $\\mathrm{[M+Na]^+}$, the relationship is $M_i = (m/z)_i - m_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$. Given $m_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = 22.98977 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, we calculate the $M_i$ values:\n- $M_1 = 1066.506 - 22.98977 = 1043.51623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_2 = 1170.656 - 22.98977 = 1147.66623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_3 = 1274.806 - 22.98977 = 1251.81623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_4 = 1378.956 - 22.98977 = 1355.96623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_5 = 1483.106 - 22.98977 = 1460.11623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_6 = 1587.256 - 22.98977 = 1564.26623 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nNext, we compute the necessary sums using the given intensities $I_i$ and the calculated molar masses $M_i$:\n- $\\sum_i I_i = 80 + 140 + 200 + 160 + 100 + 40 = 720$\n\n- $\\sum_i I_i M_i$:\n$ (80 \\times 1043.51623) + (140 \\times 1147.66623) + (200 \\times 1251.81623) + (160 \\times 1355.96623) + (100 \\times 1460.11623) + (40 \\times 1564.26623) $\n$ = 83481.2984 + 160673.2722 + 250363.246 + 216954.5968 + 146011.623 + 62570.6492 = 920054.6856 $\n\n- $\\sum_i I_i M_i^2$:\n$ (80 \\times (1043.51623)^2) + (140 \\times (1147.66623)^2) + (200 \\times (1251.81623)^2) + (160 \\times (1355.96623)^2) + (100 \\times (1460.11623)^2) + (40 \\times (1564.26623)^2) $\n$ \\approx 87114064.03 + 184399312.9 + 313408840.1 + 294183287.8 + 213193951.1 + 97884342.43 = 1190183798.36 $\n\nNow we can calculate $M_n$ and $M_w$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i I_i M_i}{\\sum_i I_i} = \\frac{920054.6856}{720} \\approx 1277.85373 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i I_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i I_i M_i} = \\frac{1190183798.36}{920054.6856} \\approx 1293.60017 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the polydispersity index, $\\mathrm{PDI}$:\n$$\\mathrm{PDI} = \\frac{M_w}{M_n} = \\frac{1293.60017}{1277.85373} \\approx 1.012322$$\n\nRounding each result to four significant figures as required:\n- $M_n = 1278 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $M_w = 1294 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $\\mathrm{PDI} = 1.012$\n\nThe final answers are $M_n = 1278 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, $M_w = 1294 \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $\\mathrm{PDI} = 1.012$.",
