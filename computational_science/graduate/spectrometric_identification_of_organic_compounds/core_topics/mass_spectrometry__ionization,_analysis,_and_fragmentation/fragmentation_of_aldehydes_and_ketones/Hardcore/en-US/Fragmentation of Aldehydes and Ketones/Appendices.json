Because the charge resides on one of the two fragments, the ionic mass is the sum of the monoisotopic atomic masses of the atoms in that fragment minus one electron mass $m_{e}$, and the charge state is $z=+1$, so $m/z$ equals the ionic mass for singly charged cations.\n\nFor $3$-pentanone, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CO-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_3$, both $\\alpha$ positions are $\\text{CH}_2$ groups and the molecule is symmetrical with respect to the carbonyl.

The prediction can be, and is, confirmed by experimental mass spectra of 4-methyl-2-pentanone.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete for the task required. The solution process may proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe molecule is 4-methyl-2-pentanone, which has the structure $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CH-CH}_2\\text{-C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_3$. Upon electron ionization, it forms the molecular radical cation $[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CH-CH}_2\\text{-C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_3]^{+\\cdot}$. The nominal mass of this ion is $M = (6 \\times 12) + (12 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 16) = 100$, so its $m/z$ is $100$.\n\nThe problem asks to compare the two possible $\\alpha$-cleavage pathways. An $\\alpha$-cleavage is the homolytic cleavage of a C-C bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. The general process is:\n$$\n[\\text{R-C(}{=}\\text{O)-R'}]^{+\\cdot} \\rightarrow [\\text{R-C}\\equiv\\text{O}^+ \\leftrightarrow \\text{R-C}{=}\\text{O}^+] + \\text{R'}^{\\cdot} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\text{R}^{\\cdot} + [\\text{R'-C}\\equiv\\text{O}^+ \\leftrightarrow \\text{R'-C}{=}\\text{O}^+]\n$$\nWe must analyze the thermodynamics of the two specific pathways for 4-methyl-2-pentanone. The favored pathway will be the one that produces the set of fragments (acylium ion and radical) with the lowest combined enthalpy. This is equivalent to maximizing the stability of both fragments.\n\n### Pathway 1: Cleavage of the $\\text{C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_3$ bond\nThis involves the loss of a methyl radical.\n$$\n[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{-C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_3]^{+\\cdot} \\rightarrow [(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{-C=O}]^+ + \\text{CH}_3^{\\cdot}\n$$\n- **Ionic Fragment:** Isovaleryl cation, $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{-CO}^+$. The nominal mass is calculated as: $(5 \\times 12) + (9 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 16) = 60 + 9 + 16 = 85$. Thus, this fragment appears at $m/z=85$. The isobutyl group ($(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{-}$) is an electron-donating alkyl group that stabilizes the positive charge on the acylium ion via induction.\n- **Neutral Fragment:** Methyl radical, $\\text{CH}_3^{\\cdot}$. According to the provided stability order (tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl), the methyl radical is the *least* stable of all simple alkyl radicals.\n\n### Pathway 2: Cleavage of the $\\text{C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_2$ bond\nThis involves the loss of an isobutyl radical.\n$$\n[(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{-C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_3]^{+\\cdot} \\rightarrow [\\text{CH}_3\\text{-C=O}]^+ + {}^{\\cdot}\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH(CH}_3)_2\n$$\n- **Ionic Fragment:** Acetyl cation, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CO}^+$. The nominal mass is calculated as: $(2 \\times 12) + (3 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 16) = 24 + 3 + 16 = 43$. Thus, this fragment appears at $m/z=43$. The methyl group provides inductive stabilization, but it is smaller and less electron-donating than the isobutyl group in Pathway 1. Therefore, the acetyl cation is slightly *less* stable than the isovaleryl cation.\n- **Neutral Fragment:** Isobutyl radical, ${}^{\\cdot}\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH(CH}_3)_2$. The unpaired electron resides on a primary carbon, making this a *primary* radical. According to the stability order, a primary radical is significantly *more* stable than a methyl radical.\n\n### Comparison and Prediction\nWe must weigh the competing effects:\n- **Pathway 1:** Produces a *more stable* acylium ion ($(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{CO}^+$) and a *less stable* radical ($\\text{CH}_3^{\\cdot}$).\n- **Pathway 2:** Produces a *less stable* acylium ion ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^+$) and a *more stable* radical (${}^{\\cdot}\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH(CH}_3)_2$).\n\nIn the fragmentation of acyclic ketones via $\\alpha$-cleavage, the stability of the departing alkyl radical is generally the dominant energetic factor. The energy difference between a primary radical and a methyl radical is substantial (on the order of $4-5 \\text{ kcal/mol}$), whereas the difference in stability between the two acylium cations, both stabilized by resonance and differing only by the inductive effect of their alkyl substituents, is comparatively small.\n\nTherefore, the pathway that forms the more stable radical is strongly favored. This is Pathway 2, which expels the primary isobutyl radical. The dominance of this pathway is a well-established empirical rule in mass spectrometry, often stated as \"cleavage favors the loss of the larger alkyl group.\"\n\nThe dominant $\\alpha$-cleavage is the cleavage of the $\\text{C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_2$ bond, leading to the formation of the acetyl cation ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^+$) at $m/z=43$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Cleave the $\\text{C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_3$ bond; the dominant fragment is the more substituted acylium cation $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CH-CH}_2\\text{-CO}^+$ at $m/z=85$, because greater substitution on the acylium cation outweighs differences in radical stability.**\n- The pathway and resulting fragment ($m/z=85$) are correctly identified for this cleavage. However, the reasoning is incorrect. The stabilization of the acylium ion is a smaller effect than the stabilization of the departing radical. This pathway forms the highly unstable methyl radical, making it energetically less favorable.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Cleave the $\\text{C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_2$ bond on the isobutyl side; the dominant fragment is the acetyl acylium cation $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^+$ at $m/z=43$, because this pathway produces a highly resonance-stabilized acylium cation and a more stabilized isobutyl radical, jointly lowering $\\Delta H_{\\text{eff}}$.**\n- This option correctly identifies the favored cleavage bond ($\\text{C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_2$), the dominant fragment ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^+$), and its correct $m/z$ ratio ($43$). The reasoning is sound: while both resulting acylium ions are resonance-stabilized, this pathway is favored because it produces a more stabilized radical (primary isobutyl radical vs. methyl radical). The combined stability of the products makes this the lower-energy pathway, as stated by \"jointly lowering $\\Delta H_{\\text{eff}}$\". This aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Both $\\alpha$-cleavages are comparable because $\\text{C-CO}$ bond strengths are identical; no energetic preference exists, so fragment intensities should be similar.**\n- This statement is flawed. The preference for a fragmentation pathway is determined by the stability of the products (transition state leading to them), not solely by the initial bond strength. Furthermore, the stabilities of the two sets of products (ion and radical) are significantly different, as analyzed above. There is a strong energetic preference.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Cleave the $\\text{C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_3$ bond; the dominant fragment is $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^+$ at $m/z=43$, because forming a smaller neutral radical $\\text{CH}_3^{\\cdot}$ is enthalpically favorable relative to forming a primary isobutyl radical.**\n- This option is internally contradictory. Cleavage of the $\\text{C(}{=}\\text{O)-CH}_3$ bond would form the $(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHCH}_2\\text{CO}^+$ ion ($m/z=85$), not the $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^+$ ion ($m/z=43$). Additionally, the reasoning is factually incorrect; forming the smaller methyl radical is enthalpically *unfavorable* compared to forming the larger, more stable primary isobutyl radical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Therefore, this is an $\\alpha$-carbon. The chain terminates at this $\\alpha$-carbon. There are no $\\beta$- or $\\gamma$-carbons on this side. Consequently, there are no $\\gamma$-hydrogens on the methyl side.\n\n2.  **The tert-butyl side ($-\\text{C(CH}_3)_3$)**: The quaternary carbon is directly bonded to the carbonyl carbon, making it the $\\alpha'$-carbon. This $\\alpha'$-carbon is bonded to three other methyl groups. The carbons of these three methyl groups are one step further away from the carbonyl, making them $\\beta'$-carbons. Let's trace a contiguous chain: Carbonyl $\\rightarrow \\text{C}_{\\alpha'} \\rightarrow \\text{C}_{\\beta'}$. The chain terminates at the $\\beta'$-carbons, as they are only bonded to hydrogens and the $\\alpha'$-carbon. There are no carbons attached to the $\\beta'$-carbons to be in the $\\gamma'$ position. Therefore, there are no $\\gamma'$-carbons and, by extension, no $\\gamma'$-hydrogens on the tert-butyl side.\n\nThe necessary condition for the McLafferty rearrangement is the presence of at least one $\\gamma$-hydrogen. Our analysis shows that tert-butyl methyl ketone possesses hydrogens on $\\alpha$-carbons and $\\beta$-carbons, but it completely lacks any $\\gamma$-hydrogens. Without a $\\gamma$-hydrogen, the defined $6$-membered transition state (involving the carbonyl oxygen, carbonyl carbon, $\\text{C}_{\\alpha}$, $\\text{C}_{\\beta}$, $\\text{C}_{\\gamma}$, and $\\text{H}_{\\gamma}$) cannot be formed.\n\nTherefore, the McLafferty rearrangement is structurally impossible for tert-butyl methyl ketone and must be suppressed or disallowed.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The McLafferty rearrangement is suppressed because there is no $\\gamma$-hydrogen on either side contiguous with the carbonyl; the tert-butyl side terminates at the $\\beta$ position within each branch, and the methyl side terminates at the $\\alpha$ position. Steric congestion at the quaternary $\\alpha$-carbon further disfavors the $6$-membered transition state.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivation. It correctly identifies the core reason for suppression: the absence of any $\\gamma$-hydrogens. It provides an accurate description of the chain lengths on both sides of the carbonyl (\"terminates at the $\\beta$ position\" and \"terminates at the $\\alpha$ position\"). The second clause concerning steric congestion at the quaternary $\\alpha'$-carbon is also a valid chemical principle. Even if a $\\gamma$-hydrogen were present (e.g., if one of the methyls on the t-butyl group was an ethyl group), the bulky nature of the quaternary center would sterically hinder the formation of the required cyclic transition state. However, the primary reason remains the lack of a $\\gamma$-hydrogen. The entire statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The McLafferty rearrangement is strongly allowed via the tert-butyl side because its multiple methyl groups provide many hydrogens; hyperconjugation from the tert-butyl substituent promotes the $6$-membered transition state despite branching.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While the tert-butyl-group does provide many hydrogens ($9$ of them), they are all on $\\beta$-carbons, not $\\gamma$-carbons. They are $\\beta$-hydrogens and are irrelevant to the McLafferty rearrangement as defined. The claim that the rearrangement is \"strongly allowed\" is directly contrary to the structural requirements. Hyperconjugation is a real electronic effect but is not the specific mechanism that enables this concerted pericyclic-like reaction; the statement misapplies this concept.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The McLafferty rearrangement is allowed via the methyl side, because the methyl hydrogens count as $\\gamma$-hydrogens when both substituents are considered together; the reaction yields an intense McLafferty ion.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It violates the explicit definition that positions are \"counted along a single, contiguous chain.\" It is nonsensical to suggest that hydrogens on the $\\alpha$-carbon of the methyl side could somehow be designated as $\\gamma$-hydrogens. There is no valid chemical principle that allows for such counting across disconnected parts of the molecule for this type of rearrangement. The hydrogens on the methyl group are $\\alpha$-hydrogens.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The McLafferty rearrangement is disallowed under EI but becomes allowed under chemical ionization (CI) due to lower internal energy, enabling through-space hydrogen transfer even without a contiguous $\\gamma$-hydrogen.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The first part, \"disallowed under EI,\" is correct. However, the second part is specious. Chemical ionization (CI) is a softer ionization method that imparts *less* internal energy to the molecular ion compared to EI. Less energy generally leads to *less* fragmentation and disfavors reactions with significant activation barriers. It does not magically enable a structurally forbidden reaction. While other types of rearrangements (e.g., through-space hydrogen transfers) can occur in specific molecules, they are not called McLafferty rearrangements, and there is no general principle that CI would specifically induce such a process in pinacolone. The statement incorrectly links CI and lower energy to enabling a forbidden pathway.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A provides a chemically correct and complete explanation.",
