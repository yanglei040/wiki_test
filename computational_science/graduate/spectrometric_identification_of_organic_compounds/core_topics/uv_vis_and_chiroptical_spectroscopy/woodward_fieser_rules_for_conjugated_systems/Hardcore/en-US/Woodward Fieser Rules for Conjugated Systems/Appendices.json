            "problem": "An organic chemist records the Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum of the acyclic polyene $2,5$-dimethyl-$1,3,5,7$-octatetraene in ethanol at $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Using the empirically established Woodward–Fieser rules for conjugated systems, estimate the absorption maximum $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for the lowest-energy $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ transition. Your reasoning must begin from fundamental photophysical principles about how conjugation and substituents influence electronic transition energies and then proceed to the empirical rule-based estimation. Identify and justify the class of conjugated system present and enumerate all contributing structural features, presenting a clear tabulation of each increment from the appropriate base value. Finally, sum the contributions to obtain $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n\nExpress the final $\\lambda_{\\max}$ in nanometers and include a solvent note indicating ethanol. Round your numerical result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an estimation of the maximum absorption wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, for the acyclic polyene $2,5$-dimethyl-$1,3,5,7$-octatetraene using the Woodward–Fieser rules. The problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique solution based on this established empirical method.\n\nThe absorption of ultraviolet-visible radiation by a molecule containing a chromophore promotes an electron from a lower-energy molecular orbital to a higher-energy one. In conjugated systems such as polyenes, the electronic transition of lowest energy, which corresponds to the longest absorption wavelength $\\lambda_{\\max}$, is the promotion of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In these molecules, both the HOMO and LUMO are of $\\pi$-symmetry, and the transition is thus designated as a $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ transition.\n\nThe energy difference, $\\Delta E$, between the HOMO and the LUMO is a critical determinant of $\\lambda_{\\max}$. As the extent of conjugation increases (i.e., as the number of alternating single and double bonds in a chain increases), the energy of the HOMO is raised and the energy of the LUMO is lowered. This leads to a smaller HOMO-LUMO energy gap, $\\Delta E$. According to the Planck-Einstein relation, $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light, a smaller energy gap corresponds to the absorption of light of longer wavelength. Consequently, extending conjugation results in a bathochromic shift (a shift to longer wavelengths) of $\\lambda_{\\max}$. Substituents attached to the conjugated system can also perturb the $\\pi$ orbital energy levels, causing further shifts in $\\lambda_{\\max}$. The Woodward–Fieser rules provide an empirical framework to quantify these structural effects and predict $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n\nThe molecule in question is $2,5$-dimethyl-$1,3,5,7$-octatetraene. Its structure is:\n$$ \\mathrm{H_2C^1=C^2(CH_3)-C^3H=C^4H-C^5(CH_3)=C^6H-C^7H=C^8H_2} $$\nThis is an acyclic polyene containing four conjugated double bonds (a tetraene). To estimate its $\\lambda_{\\max}$, we apply the Woodward–Fieser rules for conjugated dienes and polyenes. The calculation proceeds by summing increments for various structural features, starting from a base value for a parent chromophore.\n\n$1$. **Base Value**: The parent chromophore for a polyene is considered to be a conjugated diene. For an acyclic or heteroannular (dienes in separate rings) conjugated diene, the established base value for $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is $217 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n$2$. **Contribution from Extended Conjugation**: The molecule is a tetraene, which has two more conjugated double bonds than the diene system of the base value. The rules state that an increment of $+30 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ should be added for each additional double bond extending the conjugation.\nIncrement for two additional C=C bonds = $2 \\times 30 \\, \\mathrm{nm} = 60 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n$3$. **Contribution from Substituents**: We must identify any substituents attached directly to the carbon atoms of the conjugated system. In this molecule, the conjugated system comprises all eight carbon atoms of the octatetraene chain. There are two methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$) groups, which are alkyl substituents, attached at positions $C_2$ and $C_5$. An increment of $+5 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ is added for each alkyl substituent or ring residue attached to the conjugated system.\nIncrement for two alkyl substituents = $2 \\times 5 \\, \\mathrm{nm} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n$4$. **Other Contributions**:\n- **Exocyclic Double Bonds**: An exocyclic double bond is one where one of its carbon atoms is part of a ring system. Since the molecule is acyclic, there are no rings and therefore no exocyclic double bonds. The contribution is $0 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **Solvent**: The standard Woodward-Fieser values are based on measurements in ethanol. The problem specifies ethanol as the solvent, so no correction is needed.\n\nThe estimated $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is the sum of the base value and all applicable increments. The contributions are tabulated as follows:\n- Base value (acyclic conjugated diene): $217 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$\n- Two additional conjugated double bonds: $60 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$\n- Two alkyl substituents: $10 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$\n\nThe total calculated absorption maximum is the sum of these values:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max} = 217 \\, \\mathrm{nm} + 60 \\, \\mathrm{nm} + 10 \\, \\mathrm{nm} = 287 \\, \\mathrm{nm} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed to four significant figures. The calculated integer value is $287$. To present this with four significant figures, we write it as $287.0$. The predicted absorption maximum for $2,5$-dimethyl-$1,3,5,7$-octatetraene in ethanol is therefore $287.0 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$.",

            "problem": "An unknown organic chromophore shows a single dominant band in Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy at an observed wavelength of maximum absorption $\\lambda_{\\max}$ equal to $247\\,\\text{nm}$, with an observed maximum molar absorptivity $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ equal to $1.18 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, measured in a nonpolar, noninteracting solvent at ambient temperature.

Using first principles of spectrophotometry and the Woodward–Fieser rules for conjugated systems, reason from Beer–Lambert law and known trends in oscillator strengths to assess how $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ values distinguish enones from pure dienes, and use rule-based estimates for $\\lambda_{\\max}$ to quantitatively compare each assignment to the observed data.\n\nDefine the diagnostic difference\n$$\\Delta \\equiv \\left|\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} - \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,diene)}}\\right| - \\left|\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} - \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,enone)}}\\right|,$$\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}}$ is the observed value, and $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,diene)}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,enone)}}$ are your rule-based predictions for the diene and enone assignments, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem requires the evaluation of two potential structural assignments for an unknown organic chromophore based on its Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectrum. The primary data are the observed wavelength of maximum absorption, $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} = 247\\,\\text{nm}$, and the maximum molar absorptivity, $\\varepsilon_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} = 1.18 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The two hypotheses are (i) an acyclic $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone (enone) with specific substitution, and (ii) an acyclic conjugated diene with a given number of substituents. The analysis will proceed in two parts: a qualitative assessment based on $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ and a quantitative assessment using the Woodward–Fieser rules to predict $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for each structure.\n\nThe intensity of a UV-Vis absorption band, quantified by $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$, is related to the probability of the electronic transition. According to the Beer–Lambert law, $A = \\varepsilon c l$, where $A$ is absorbance, $c$ is molar concentration, and $l$ is the path length. The value of $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ is an intrinsic molecular property for a given transition. For allowed $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ transitions, $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ values are typically high, often in the range of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. However, there are characteristic differences between chromophore types. Acyclic conjugated dienes in their favored s-trans conformation typically exhibit $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ values in the range of $20,000$ to $23,000\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. In contrast, the $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ transition in acyclic $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketones generally has a lower intensity, with $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ values typically between $10,000$ and $13,000\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The observed value, $\\varepsilon_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} = 1.18 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, falls squarely within the expected range for an enone and is significantly lower than that expected for a simple acyclic diene. This provides strong qualitative evidence in favor of the enone assignment (i).\n\nNext, we perform a quantitative analysis by predicting the $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for each proposed structure using the Woodward–Fieser rules.\n\n**Prediction for Enone Assignment (i):**\nWe apply the rules for $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n- The base value for an acyclic $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone is $215\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- The contribution for one alkyl substituent at the $\\alpha$-position is an increment of $+10\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- The contribution for two alkyl substituents at the $\\beta$-position is an increment of $2 \\times (+12\\,\\text{nm}) = +24\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- The problem states there are no exocyclic double bonds, so the increment for this feature is $0\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- The problem also implies a simple enone system, with no further double bonds extending conjugation.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the predicted maximum absorption wavelength for the enone:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,enone)}} = 215\\,\\text{nm} + 10\\,\\text{nm} + 24\\,\\text{nm} = 249\\,\\text{nm} $$\nIt is noted that these rules are standardized for ethanol as the solvent. The use of a nonpolar solvent might introduce a slight hypsochromic (blue) shift. However, without specific correction values provided, we proceed with the standard prediction as the best estimate.\n\n**Prediction for Diene Assignment (ii):**\nWe apply the rules for conjugated dienes.\n- The base value for an acyclic conjugated diene is $217\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- The contribution for each of the three alkyl substituents attached to the diene system is an increment of $+5\\,\\text{nm}$. The total contribution is $3 \\times (+5\\,\\text{nm}) = +15\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- The problem states there are no exocyclic double bonds, so the increment is $0\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the predicted maximum absorption wavelength for the diene:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,diene)}} = 217\\,\\text{nm} + 15\\,\\text{nm} = 232\\,\\text{nm} $$\n\n**Calculation of the Diagnostic Difference, $\\Delta$:**\nWith the predicted values, we can now compute $\\Delta$. The given values are:\n- $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} = 247\\,\\text{nm}$\n- $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,enone)}} = 249\\,\\text{nm}$\n- $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,diene)}} = 232\\,\\text{nm}$\n\nThe diagnostic difference $\\Delta$ is defined as:\n$$ \\Delta \\equiv \\left|\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} - \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,diene)}}\\right| - \\left|\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} - \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,enone)}}\\right| $$\nFirst, we compute the individual absolute differences:\n$$ \\left|\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} - \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,diene)}}\\right| = |247\\,\\text{nm} - 232\\,\\text{nm}| = 15\\,\\text{nm} $$\n$$ \\left|\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(obs)}} - \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{(pred,enone)}}\\right| = |247\\,\\text{nm} - 249\\,\\text{nm}| = |-2\\,\\text{nm}| = 2\\,\\text{nm} $$\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = 15\\,\\text{nm} - 2\\,\\text{nm} = 13\\,\\text{nm} $$\nThe value of $\\Delta$ is positive, which indicates that the prediction for the enone structure ($249\\,\\text{nm}$) is significantly closer to the observed value ($247\\,\\text{nm}$) than the prediction for the diene structure ($232\\,\\text{nm}$). This quantitative result, combined with the qualitative assessment of $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$, provides a compelling case for assigning the chromophore as the specified $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of $\\Delta$, rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $13$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $13.00$.",

The problem states that one of the double bonds (the methylene unit at the ring junction) is exocyclic to both fused rings. The classmate's calculation applies the increment of $+5$ nm twice, for a total of $+10$ nm, reasoning that the bond is exocyclic to two rings.\n\nThe conceptual error lies in this double counting. The Woodward–Fieser rules specify an increment of $+5$ nm for each double bond in the conjugated system that has an exocyclic position relative to a ring. The rule typically counts the number of such bonds, not the number of rings to which a single bond might be exocyclic. Therefore, even though the methylene double bond is exocyclic to two rings, it is still only one double bond possessing exocyclic character. Consequently, it should contribute only a single increment of $+5$ nm.
