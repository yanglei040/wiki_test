This first exercise provides a classic case study involving the three saturated isomers of $C_3H_8O$.

            "problem": "A liquid organic sample is known to have the molecular formula $C_3H_8O$. The three constitutionally isomeric candidates are $1$-propanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$), $2$-propanol ($( \\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHOH}$), and methoxyethane ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$). The goal is to design a minimal spectral workflow that, under routine bench conditions, will conclusively assign the connectivity for each candidate using first-principles reasoning about spectral responses. Assume ordinary concentrations, non-degenerate conformations, and no interfering functional groups beyond those implied by the formula. The minimal workflow is defined as the smallest set of complementary techniques that, collectively, remove all structural ambiguity among the three candidates.\n\nUse the following foundational bases: the index of hydrogen deficiency $IHD$ computed from $C$, $H$, $N$, and $X$ counts; the selection rules and characteristic band positions for Infrared spectroscopy (IR); the definitions of chemical shift $\\delta$, scalar coupling $J$, and integration in proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR); the $n+1$ rule for first-order vicinal coupling; and the general observation that spin-spin coupling across oxygen is negligible for O-CH$_3$ protons in simple ethers. Acronyms must be interpreted as follows on first appearance: Infrared (IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry (EI-MS), High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS), Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT), Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC), Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC), Gas Chromatography (GC).\n\nWhich option specifies a truly minimal workflow along with the specific diagnostic features that, if observed, conclusively assign connectivity for each of the three candidates?\n\nA. IR followed by one-dimensional proton NMR ($^{1}$H NMR). First compute $$IHD = \\frac{2C+2-H-X+N}{2}$$ to confirm saturation ($IHD = 0$ for $C_3H_8O$). Use IR to decide alcohol versus ether: a broad O-H stretch at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3200-3600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ indicates an alcohol; its absence supports an ether. Then, in $^{1}$H NMR, use integration and multiplicity to assign connectivity: for $2$-propanol, a methine $\\text{CH}$ adjacent to $\\text{OH}$ appears at $\\delta \\approx 3.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ as a septet ($n+1$ with $n=6$ equivalent $\\text{CH}_3$ protons, $J \\approx 6-7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$), and two equivalent methyl groups appear at $\\delta \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ as a doublet ($6\\,\\mathrm{H}$ total). For $1$-propanol, observe a terminal methyl triplet at $\\delta \\approx 0.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($3\\,\\mathrm{H}$, $J \\approx 7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$), a middle methylene multiplet at $\\delta \\approx 1.5-1.7\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($2\\,\\mathrm{H}$), and an O-$\\text{CH}_2$ triplet at $\\delta \\approx 3.5-3.7\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($2\\,\\mathrm{H}$). For methoxyethane, the absence of the O-H stretch in IR and the presence in $^{1}$H NMR of an O-$\\text{CH}_3$ singlet at $\\delta \\approx 3.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($3\\,\\mathrm{H}$, negligible vicinal coupling across oxygen), together with an ethyl group pattern consisting of a $\\text{CH}_3$ triplet at $\\delta \\approx 1.2\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($3\\,\\mathrm{H}$) and a O-$\\text{CH}_2$ quartet at $\\delta \\approx 3.4\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($2\\,\\mathrm{H}$), conclusively assigns the ether connectivity.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to a rigorous validation process and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a conclusive answer. The problem asks for the minimal spectral workflow, defined as the smallest set of complementary techniques, to distinguish the three constitutional isomers of $C_3H_8O$: $1$-propanol, $2$-propanol, and methoxyethane.\n\n**First-Principles Analysis**\n\nThe molecular formula is $C_3H_8O$. The index of hydrogen deficiency ($IHD$) is calculated as:\n$$IHD = C + 1 - \\frac{H}{2} - \\frac{X}{2} + \\frac{N}{2} = 3 + 1 - \\frac{8}{2} = 0$$\nAn $IHD$ of $0$ indicates a saturated acyclic molecule, which is consistent with all three candidate structures. This calculation confirms the structures are plausible but does not distinguish among them.\n\nThe three candidates are:\n1.  **$1$-propanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$)**: A primary alcohol.\n2.  **$2$-propanol ($(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHOH}$)**: A secondary alcohol.\n3.  **Methoxyethane ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$)**: An ether.\n\nThe core task is to distinguish between two alcohols and an ether, and then to distinguish between the primary and secondary alcohol isomers.\n\n**Analysis of Spectroscopic Techniques**\n\n1.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**:\n    IR spectroscopy is exceptionally effective at identifying functional groups.\n    *   **Alcohols** ($1$-propanol and $2$-propanol) will exhibit a characteristic strong and broad absorption band for the O-H stretch, typically in the range of $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3200-3600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Ethers** (methoxyethane) lack an O-H bond and will therefore show a conspicuous absence of this band. They do show a C-O-C stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1100\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\n    Thus, IR spectroscopy can, in a single experiment, conclusively identify methoxyethane by the absence of the O-H stretch. However, while there are subtle differences in the C-O stretching frequencies between primary ($\\approx 1050\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$) and secondary ($\\approx 1100\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$) alcohols, distinguishing between $1$-propanol and $2$-propanol by IR alone is not considered robust or conclusive under routine conditions. Therefore, IR is a necessary but insufficient technique for the complete task.\n\n2.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{1}$H NMR) Spectroscopy**:\n    $^{1}$H NMR spectroscopy provides detailed information about the connectivity of the carbon-hydrogen framework via chemical shift ($\\delta$), integration (relative number of protons), and spin-spin coupling (multiplicity).\n\n    *   **$1$-Propanol ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$)**: Exhibits a propyl group pattern.\n        *   A triplet ($\\delta \\approx 0.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $3\\mathrm{H}$) for the terminal $\\text{CH}_3$ group coupled to the adjacent $\\text{CH}_2$.\n        *   A triplet ($\\delta \\approx 3.6\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $2\\mathrm{H}$) for the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group coupled to the adjacent $\\text{CH}_2$.\n        *   A complex multiplet (a sextet, $\\delta \\approx 1.6\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $2\\mathrm{H}$) for the central $\\text{CH}_2$ group coupled to both the $\\text{CH}_3$ and $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ groups.\n        *   A variable, often broad, singlet for the $\\text{OH}$ proton ($1\\mathrm{H}$).\n\n    *   **$2$-Propanol ($(\\text{CH}_3)_2\\text{CHOH}$)**: Exhibits a characteristic isopropyl group pattern.\n        *   A doublet ($\\delta \\approx 1.2\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $6\\mathrm{H}$) for the two equivalent $\\text{CH}_3$ groups, coupled to the single methine proton.\n        *   A septet ($\\delta \\approx 4.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $1\\mathrm{H}$) for the $\\text{CHOH}$ methine proton, coupled to the six equivalent methyl protons.\n        *   A variable singlet for the $\\text{OH}$ proton ($1\\mathrm{H}$).\n\n    *   **Methoxyethane ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$)**: Exhibits an ethyl group pattern and a methoxy singlet.\n        *   A singlet ($\\delta \\approx 3.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $3\\mathrm{H}$) for the $\\text{OCH}_3$ group (no adjacent protons for coupling).\n        *   A quartet ($\\delta \\approx 3.4\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $2\\mathrm{H}$) for the $\\text{OCH}_2$ group coupled to the adjacent $\\text{CH}_3$.\n        *   A triplet ($\\delta \\approx 1.2\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $3\\mathrm{H}$) for the terminal $\\text{CH}_3$ group coupled to the adjacent $\\text{OCH}_2$.\n\n    The $^{1}$H NMR spectrum for each of the three isomers is uniquely diagnostic. Therefore, $^{1}$H NMR alone can, in principle, distinguish all three isomers.\n\n**Evaluation of Minimal Workflow**\n\nThe problem defines the minimal workflow as \"the smallest set of complementary techniques that, collectively, remove all structural ambiguity\". While $^{1}$H NMR alone (a set of one technique) is sufficient, the combination of IR and $^{1}$H NMR (a set of two techniques) represents a classic, robust, and pedagogically standard workflow. IR provides unambiguous functional group identification, and $^{1}$H NMR provides unambiguous skeletal connectivity. They are perfectly complementary. The workflow presented in Option A, which utilizes this combination, is highly conclusive and practical.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. IR followed by one-dimensional proton NMR ($^{1}$H NMR).**\nThis option proposes a workflow where IR is used first to separate the ether from the two alcohols. Then, $^{1}$H NMR is used to distinguish the primary alcohol ($1$-propanol) from the secondary alcohol ($2$-propanol). The description of the expected spectral data for all three isomers is entirely correct.\n*   The use of IR to identify the O-H stretch at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3200-3600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ is the standard method for identifying alcohols. Its absence conclusively proves the compound is the ether, methoxyethane.\n*   The predicted $^{1}$H NMR patterns for $1$-propanol (propyl system: triplet, multiplet, triplet) and $2$-propanol (isopropyl system: $6\\mathrm{H}$ doublet, $1\\mathrm{H}$ septet) are textbook examples and are completely diagnostic.\n*   The description for methoxyethane (methoxy singlet and ethyl pattern) is also correct.\nThis workflow is robust, conclusive, and aligns with the definition of using complementary techniques. All specific details provided are scientifically sound.\n*Verdict: Correct.*\n\n**B. EI-MS only.**\nThis option proposes using Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry alone. It claims that $1$-propanol gives a dominant peak at $m/z=31$ ($[\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}]^+$) and $2$-propanol gives a base peak at $m/z=45$ ($[\\text{CH}_3\\text{CHOH}]^+$). This part is generally correct. However, it claims that methoxyethane can be assigned by the *absence* of $m/z=31$. This is factually incorrect. Methoxyethane ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{OCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$) can undergo alpha-cleavage by losing an ethyl radical to form the $[\\text{CH}_3\\text{O}]^+$ fragment, which has an $m/z$ of $31$. Therefore, EI-MS cannot reliably distinguish $1$-propanol from methoxyethane on this basis. The workflow is not conclusive.\n*Verdict: Incorrect.*\n\n**C. Carbon-13 NMR ($^{13}$C NMR) with DEPT-135 only.**\nThis option proposes a workflow using $^{13}$C NMR with DEPT-135. This combination of techniques is indeed powerful enough to distinguish the three isomers: $2$-propanol is unique in having only $2$ carbon signals; $1$-propanol and methoxyethane both have $3$ signals but can be distinguished by their DEPT-135 spectra ($1$-propanol: one positive $\\text{CH}_3$ signal, two negative $\\text{CH}_2$ signals; methoxyethane: two positive $\\text{CH}_3$ signals, one negative $\\text{CH}_2$ signal). However, the justification text contains a critical scientific error: \"...infer functional class by the presence or absence of an O-H signature in $^{13}$C...\". Carbon-13 NMR detects carbon nuclei; it does not directly detect protons on oxygen atoms. One infers an alcohol functional group from the chemical shift of the carbon atom bearing the $\\text{OH}$ group, not from a direct \"O-H signature\". This flawed explanation invalidates the option as a correct answer.\n*Verdict: Incorrect.*\n\n**D. IR, $^{1}$H NMR, and two-dimensional HSQC and HMBC.**\nThis option proposes a large suite of experiments including 2D NMR techniques. While this workflow would certainly be conclusive, it is far from minimal. The 1D techniques described in option A are sufficient to solve the problem completely. The claim that \"only a full suite including HSQC/HMBC can be considered conclusive\" is false for this simple case. This workflow violates the \"minimal\" requirement.\n*Verdict: Incorrect.*\n\n**E. IR alone.**\nThis option proposes using only IR spectroscopy. As discussed, IR can conclusively identify methoxyethane by the absence of an O-H stretch. However, its ability to distinguish between $1$-propanol and $2$-propanol is not reliable under routine conditions. The shape and position of the broad O-H stretch are highly dependent on experimental conditions (concentration, temperature, solvent) and are not robust diagnostic criteria. Therefore, this workflow is not conclusive for all three candidates.\n*Verdict: Incorrect.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides a scientifically sound, conclusive, and robust workflow. The combination of IR and $^{1}$H NMR is a classic example of using complementary techniques to achieve an unambiguous structural assignment. Every piece of spectral data described in option A is correct and diagnostic. It represents the best choice among the given options.",

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Isomers:** Three constitutional isomers of molecular formula $C_3H_6O$.\n-   **Identities:** Acetone (propanone), propanal, and prop-2-enol.\n-   **Sample:** An unknown sample contains exactly one of the three isomers.\n-   **Available Techniques:** Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) as a thin film (or neat); proton nuclear magnetic resonance ($^{1}$H NMR) at $400$ MHz in deuterated chloroform; carbon-13 NMR ($^{13}$C NMR) at $100$ MHz; electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) at $70$ eV.\n-   **Conditions & Complications:** The sample may exhibit hydrogen exchange (affecting hydroxyl resonances) and keto–enol tautomerization on the $^{1}$H NMR timescale at $298$ K.\n-   **Objective:** Determine the smallest set of observables sufficient to unambiguously assign the connectivity among the three isomers, which remains reliable despite the stated complications.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The molecules (acetone, propanal, prop-2-enol) are real chemical entities with the specified formula $C_3H_6O$. The spectroscopic techniques listed are standard for organic structure elucidation. Keto-enol tautomerism and hydrogen exchange are real and relevant chemical phenomena. The specified conditions are standard.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The question asks for a minimal sufficient set of observables to distinguish three defined compounds, which is a clear and solvable problem in chemical analysis.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is described using precise, quantitative, and standard chemical terminology, free of subjectivity.\n-   **Consistency:** The problem mentions that a sample contains \"exactly one\" isomer, but also states that keto-enol tautomerization can occur. Acetone and prop-2-enol are tautomers. This is not a contradiction but a key aspect of the problem. In a realistic scenario, a sample of \"acetone\" exists in a dynamic equilibrium with a minuscule amount of its enol tautomer, prop-2-enol. A hypothetical sample of \"prop-2-enol\" would rapidly tautomerize to acetone, which is the thermodynamically stable form. The challenge is to find a set of observables that can distinguish propanal from the acetone/prop-2-enol system, and also distinguish the hypothetical pure enol based on its unique structural features (e.g., lack of a carbonyl, presence of a hydroxyl and a double bond). The problem is structured to test this understanding.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to devise a minimal and robust method to distinguish between the three isomers: acetone, propanal, and prop-2-enol. We must first predict the key spectral features for each.\n\n**1. Predicted Spectral Features**\n\n-   **Acetone (Propanone, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{C}(=\\text{O})\\text{CH}_3$)**:\n    -   **FT-IR:** Strong $C=O$ stretch near $1715 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. $sp^3$ $C-H$ stretches below $3000 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. No $O-H$ or aldehydic $C-H$ signals.\n    -   **$^{1}$H NMR:** One signal due to $C_2$ symmetry: a singlet at $\\delta \\approx 2.1 \\text{ ppm}$ integrating to $6H$.\n    -   **$^{13}$C NMR:** Two signals: a carbonyl carbon at $\\delta \\approx 205 \\text{ ppm}$ and a methyl carbon at $\\delta \\approx 30 \\text{ ppm}$.\n    -   **EI-MS:** Molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$ at $m/z = 58$. Base peak is typically at $m/z = 43$, corresponding to the acetyl cation $[\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}]^+$.\n\n-   **Propanal ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CHO}$)**:\n    -   **FT-IR:** Strong $C=O$ stretch near $1725 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. Two characteristic aldehydic $C-H$ stretches near $2820 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and $2720 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. No $O-H$ signal.\n    -   **$^{1}$H NMR:** Three signals. An aldehydic proton ($1H$) as a triplet at $\\delta \\approx 9.7-9.8 \\text{ ppm}$. A methylene group ($2H$) as a multiplet (quartet of triplets) at $\\delta \\approx 2.4 \\text{ ppm}$. A methyl group ($3H$) as a triplet at $\\delta \\approx 1.1 \\text{ ppm}$. The chemical shift of the aldehydic proton is highly diagnostic.\n    -   **$^{13}$C NMR:** Three signals: a carbonyl carbon at $\\delta \\approx 200 \\text{ ppm}$, a methylene carbon at $\\delta \\approx 35-45 \\text{ ppm}$, and a methyl carbon at $\\delta \\approx 5-15 \\text{ ppm}$.\n    -   **EI-MS:** Molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$ at $m/z = 58$. Characteristic fragments include $m/z = 57$ ($[M-H]^+$), and $m/z = 29$ ($[\\text{CHO}]^+$), which is often the base peak.\n\n-   **Prop-2-enol ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{C}(\\text{OH})\\text{CH}_3$)**:\n    -   **FT-IR:** No $C=O$ stretch. Instead, a broad $O-H$ stretch around $3200-3600 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and a $C=C$ stretch around $1650 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n    -   **$^{1}$H NMR:** Distinct signals for vinylic protons ($=\\text{CH}_2$) around $\\delta \\approx 4.0-4.5 \\text{ ppm}$, a methyl group ($\\text{CH}_3$) at $\\delta \\approx 1.8 \\text{ ppm}$, and a hydroxyl proton ($\\text{OH}$) with a variable chemical shift, which would appear as a broad singlet due to exchange. The presence of vinylic protons and an exchangeable proton, and the absence of an aldehydic proton, are key.\n    -   **$^{13}$C NMR:** No carbonyl signal. Instead, two vinylic carbon signals ($\\delta \\approx 150 \\text{ ppm}$ for $C-OH$ and $\\delta \\approx 90 \\text{ ppm}$ for $=\\text{CH}_2$) and a methyl signal.\n    -   **EI-MS:** Molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$ at $m/z = 58$. Upon ionization, the enol radical cation can readily tautomerize to the more stable keto (acetone) radical cation. Consequently, its fragmentation pattern is expected to be very similar, if not identical, to that of acetone, making EI-MS an unreliable technique for distinguishing these two tautomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Options**\n\nThe question asks for the \"smallest set of observables\" that is \"sufficient\" and \"minimal\" to distinguish the three isomers reliably.\n\n-   **A. A single $^{1}$H NMR spectrum (chemical shifts, integrals, and multiplicities) suffices in all practical cases; no other data are needed.**\n    The predicted $^{1}$H NMR spectra are indeed unique for all three isomers. Propanal is uniquely identified by the aldehydic proton signal at $\\delta \\approx 9.8 \\text{ ppm}$. Acetone is uniquely identified by a single singlet at $\\delta \\approx 2.1 \\text{ ppm}$. Prop-2-enol is uniquely identified by its vinylic proton signals. Tautomerization effects on coupling would not obscure these primary chemical shift differences. So, a full $^{1}$H NMR spectrum is sufficient. However, the option refers to the entire spectrum, which is a rich dataset. A \"minimal set of observables\" would likely be a small subset of the information from this spectrum. Thus, while true that the experiment is sufficient, the option may not be describing the *minimal set of observables*.\n\n-   **B. A single FT-IR spectrum focused on the carbonyl stretching region $1850–1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and the aldehydic C–H stretching region $2830–2690\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ suffices; no other data are needed.**\n    This proposes a minimal set of two observables from a single experiment. Let's test it:\n    1.  Signal in $C=O$ region ($1710-1740 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$)?\n    2.  Signal in aldehydic $C-H$ region ($2700-2850 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$)?\n    -   **Acetone:** (1) Yes, (2) No.\n    -   **Propanal:** (1) Yes, (2) Yes.\n    -   **Prop-2-enol:** (1) No, (2) No.\n    This set of two observables produces a unique outcome for each isomer. It is sufficient. It is also minimal in the logical sense, as neither observation alone can distinguish all three isomers. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n-   **C. High-resolution EI-MS alone suffices by recognizing distinct base peaks and neutral losses; no other data are needed.**\n    As discussed, the radical cation of prop-2-enol is expected to tautomerize to that of acetone in the mass spectrometer. This leads to very similar, if not identical, fragmentation patterns. Therefore, EI-MS is not reliable for distinguishing acetone from its enol tautomer. High resolution would only confirm the elemental composition, not resolve this ambiguity. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. The two-observable set consisting of: (i) presence versus absence of a strong FT-IR carbonyl stretch near $1710–1740\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, and (ii) presence versus absence of a $^{1}$H NMR aldehydic proton at $\\delta \\approx 9$–$10$ ppm, is sufficient and minimal under the stated conditions.**\n    This proposes a minimal set of two observables from two different experiments. Let's test it:\n    1.  Presence of FT-IR $C=O$ stretch?\n    2.  Presence of $^{1}$H NMR aldehydic proton?\n    -   **Acetone:** (1) Yes, (2) No.\n    -   **Propanal:** (1) Yes, (2) Yes.\n    -   **Prop-2-enol:** (1) No, (2) No.\n    Like option B, this two-observable set provides a unique signature for each isomer. It is sufficient and logically minimal (neither observable alone is sufficient). The observables themselves—a strong carbonyl IR band and an aldehydic proton NMR signal in an otherwise empty region of the spectrum—are exceptionally robust and unambiguous. This is also a very strong candidate.\n\n-   **E. $^{13}$C NMR with broadband decoupling plus DEPT-$135$ alone is sufficient and minimal under the stated conditions.**\n    This experimental data set is indeed sufficient. Acetone gives $2$ peaks (one positive in DEPT). Propanal gives $3$ peaks (one negative in DEPT). Prop-2-enol gives $3$ peaks (no negative peaks in DEPT). These are unique signatures. Similar to option A, this identifies a sufficient *experiment*, not necessarily the *minimal set of observables*. Furthermore, $^{13}$C NMR is less sensitive and typically requires more time and/or sample than FT-IR or $^{1}$H NMR, making it less \"minimal\" from a practical standpoint.\n\n**3. Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nWe are left comparing options B and D, both of which describe a sufficient and logically minimal set of two observables. The choice between them hinges on the reliability of the observables and the precise interpretation of the question.\n\n-   **Set B:** {IR $C=O$?, IR aldehydic $C-H$?}\n-   **Set D:** {IR $C=O$?, $^{1}$H NMR aldehydic $H$?}\n\nBoth sets use the presence/absence of a carbonyl stretch as the first decision point, which reliably separates the enol from the two carbonyl compounds. The second decision point distinguishes the aldehyde from the ketone.\n-   In set B, this is done by looking for the aldehydic $C-H$ stretches in the IR spectrum. These signals are diagnostic but are of medium-to-weak intensity and fall in a region that can have other $C-H$ absorbances, sometimes making them less than perfectly clear.\n-   In set D, this is done by looking for the aldehydic proton in the $^{1}$H NMR spectrum. This signal appears at a unique chemical shift ($\\delta \\approx 9-10 \\text{ ppm}$) where virtually no other signals occur. Its presence is an exceptionally reliable and unambiguous indicator of an aldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the set of observables in D is more robust and less prone to ambiguity than the set in B. The question asks for a set that \"remains reliable despite reasonable complications\". The superior clarity of the $^{1}$H NMR aldehydic proton signal makes the set in D more reliable. While it requires using two instruments, the question is about the information content of the *observables* themselves. Option D correctly identifies a set of two simple, binary observables that are sufficient, logically minimal, and founded on the most salient and reliable spectral features to solve this specific classification problem. This structured, flowchart-like approach is precisely what is meant by a minimal, sufficient set of identifying criteria.\n\n**Final Verdict on Options:**\n-   **A:** Incorrect. The full spectrum is more than the 'minimal set of observables'.\n-   **B:** Incorrect. While it describes a minimal sufficient set, the observables are less robust than those in option D.\n-   **C:** Incorrect. Fundamentally flawed due to tautomerization in the mass spectrometer.\n-   **D:** Correct. It identifies a logically minimal, sufficient set of two highly reliable and unambiguous observables that perfectly map to a decision tree for identifying the isomers.\n-   **E:** Incorrect. The full experiment is more information than a minimal set, and it is a less practically minimal technique.",

            "problem": "An unknown neutral organic molecule has the molecular formula $C_5H_8O_2$ and gives a clear electron ionization mass spectral molecular ion. Your task is to reason from foundational spectrometric principles to enumerate functional classes that are constitutionally plausible for this formula and to identify how one would spectroscopically discriminate among them. Proceed as follows:\n\n- Begin from the definition of the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE), also called the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency, as the count of rings plus $\\pi$ bonds implied by a molecular formula under standard valence assumptions, and compute the DBE for $C_5H_8O_2$.\n- Use the total oxygen count and the DBE to enumerate plausible functional classes among the following: esters, carboxylic acids, and cyclic anhydrides. Consider both acyclic and cyclic forms where relevant.\n- From first-principles spectroscopic reasoning, state which specific signatures in Infrared spectroscopy (IR; Infrared spectroscopy) and Mass spectrometry (MS; Mass spectrometry) would discriminate these classes. Base your reasoning on well-tested facts such as characteristic vibrational frequencies associated with functional groups and dominant electron ionization fragmentation pathways that depend on the presence or absence of labile hydrogens and heteroatom-centered cleavages.\n\nWhich option most correctly and completely executes this program for $C_5H_8O_2$?\n\nA. DBE is $2$. Plausible classes are: cyclic esters (lactones), unsaturated esters, and unsaturated carboxylic acids. Cyclic anhydrides are excluded by the oxygen count, since an anhydride requires $O_3$ per molecule. Discriminating IR features: a lactone carbonyl shows a relatively high stretching frequency near $\\sim1760$–$\\sim1780\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ due to ring strain and the absence of hydrogen bonding; an acyclic ester carbonyl appears near $\\sim1735$–$\\sim1750\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and, if the structure is unsaturated, an alkene $C=C$ band appears near $\\sim1640\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; an unsaturated carboxylic acid shows a carbonyl near $\\sim1705$–$\\sim1715\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ together with a very broad, intense $O\\!-\\!H$ stretch spanning $\\sim2500$–$\\sim3300\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. An anhydride would exhibit two carbonyl bands (antisymmetric and symmetric) near $\\sim1820$ and $\\sim1760\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, but cannot occur here given $O_2$. Discriminating MS features for $M^+$ at $m/z\\,100$: acids frequently show $M-18$ ($m/z\\,82$) from dehydration under electron ionization; esters exhibit $\\alpha$-cleavage to yield an acylium ion at $m/z\\,43$ and, if unsaturated, allylic-type cations near $m/z\\,55$; lactones frequently show decarboxylation $M-44$ ($m/z\\,56$) or loss of carbon monoxide $M-28$ ($m/z\\,72$), and often a prominent $m/z\\,55$ fragment from ring-opening allylic/acylium-stabilized cations.\n\nB. DBE is $1$. Plausible classes are: saturated esters, saturated carboxylic acids, and cyclic anhydrides. Discriminating IR features: all three will show a single carbonyl band near $\\sim1710$–$\\sim1730\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; anhydrides are identified primarily by the same single band. Discriminating MS features: all three show a dominant $m/z\\,43$ acylium ion and no characteristic neutral losses.\n\nC. DBE is $2$. Plausible classes are: acyclic esters and carboxylic acids only; cyclic esters (lactones) and cyclic anhydrides are excluded because rings are incompatible with $DBE=2$. Discriminating IR features: carboxylic acids show a sharp $O\\!-\\!H$ stretch at $\\sim3600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and carbonyl at $\\sim1750\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; esters show two distinct $C=O$ bands near $\\sim1820$ and $\\sim1760\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Discriminating MS features: esters show $M-18$ ($m/z\\,82$) from dehydration; acids show $M-44$ ($m/z\\,56$) from $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ loss.\n\nD. DBE is $2$. Plausible classes are: acyclic esters, cyclic anhydrides, and saturated carboxylic acids. Discriminating IR features: cyclic anhydrides are identified by a single strong band near $\\sim1700\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; esters by a lower-frequency band near $\\sim1680\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; acids by a narrow $O\\!-\\!H$ stretch near $\\sim3600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Discriminating MS features: acids lack $M-18$ because the $O\\!-\\!H$ bond is not labile under electron ionization, while anhydrides show a characteristic $M-18$ loss; esters do not form acylium ions at $m/z\\,43$ under electron ionization.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in spectrometric identification of organic compounds. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Unknown molecule is neutral and organic.\n- Molecular formula: $C_5H_8O_2$.\n- The molecule gives a clear electron ionization mass spectral molecular ion.\n- Task: Compute the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE), enumerate plausible functional classes (esters, carboxylic acids, cyclic anhydrides), and state how to discriminate them using IR spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific/Factual Soundness:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry: constitutional isomerism, index of hydrogen deficiency (DBE), infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The molecular formula $C_5H_8O_2$ is a valid chemical formula. The tasks are standard procedures in structure elucidation. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary information (the molecular formula) to perform the requested analysis. The constraints and questions are internally consistent.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language common to chemistry, free of ambiguity or subjective elements.\n- **Posedness:** The problem as stated leads to a unique, correct analytical procedure based on established chemical principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the full analysis.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE)**\n\nThe Double Bond Equivalent (DBE), or Index of Hydrogen Deficiency, is calculated using the formula for a molecule $C_c H_h N_n O_o X_x$:\n$$DBE = c - \\frac{h}{2} - \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + 1$$\nFor the given molecular formula $C_5H_8O_2$, we have $c=5$, $h=8$, $n=0$, $o=2$, and $x=0$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$DBE = 5 - \\frac{8}{2} + \\frac{0}{2} + 1$$\n$$DBE = 5 - 4 + 1 = 2$$\nThe DBE is $2$. This signifies that any valid structure must contain a total of two rings plus pi ($\\pi$) bonds.\n\n**Part 2: Enumeration of Plausible Functional Classes**\n\nWe consider the given functional classes: esters, carboxylic acids, and cyclic anhydrides, in the context of the formula $C_5H_8O_2$ and $DBE=2$. The presence of two oxygen atoms is a key constraint.\n\n- **Carboxylic Acids:** A carboxylic acid contains the $-\\text{COOH}$ functional group, which includes one carbonyl group ($C=O$). This accounts for one $\\pi$ bond, or $1$ DBE. To achieve a total DBE of $2$, the remaining $C_4H_7$ hydrocarbon portion of the molecule must contain either one additional $\\pi$ bond (making it an unsaturated carboxylic acid, e.g., a pentenoic acid) or one ring (making it a cyclic carboxylic acid, e.g., cyclobutanecarboxylic acid). Both are plausible for the formula $C_5H_8O_2$.\n\n- **Esters:** An ester contains the $-\\text{COO}-$ functional group, which also includes one carbonyl group ($C=O$), accounting for $1$ DBE. To reach a total DBE of $2$, the structure must contain one additional $\\pi$ bond or one ring.\n    - **Acyclic Unsaturated Ester:** An acyclic ester with a carbon-carbon double bond. Example: ethyl acrylate ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CHCOOCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$) or methyl methacrylate ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)\\text{COOCH}_3$). This class is plausible.\n    - **Cyclic Ester (Lactone):** The ester functional group is part of a ring. The ring itself accounts for $1$ DBE, and the carbonyl group accounts for another $1$ DBE, totaling $2$ DBE. Example: $\\gamma$-valerolactone. This class is plausible.\n\n- **Cyclic Anhydrides:** An anhydride functional group is $-\\text{CO-O-CO}-$. This group contains three oxygen atoms. The molecular formula $C_5H_8O_2$ has only two oxygen atoms. Therefore, any anhydride structure (cyclic or acyclic) is impossible for this molecular formula.\n\nIn summary, plausible functional classes are unsaturated/cyclic carboxylic acids and unsaturated/cyclic esters (lactones).\n\n**Part 3: Spectroscopic Discrimination**\n\nWe will outline the key discriminating features in IR and MS for the plausible classes. The nominal molecular weight is $5 \\times 12 + 8 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 16 = 100$. The molecular ion peak, $M^+$, will appear at $m/z=100$.\n\n- **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    - **Carboxylic Acid:** The most definitive feature is a very broad, strong absorption for the $O-H$ stretch, typically spanning the region from $\\sim2500\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ to $\\sim3300\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, resulting from hydrogen-bonded dimers. The $C=O$ stretch for a conjugated acid is found near $\\sim1700-\\sim1725\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. An associated $C=C$ stretch for an unsaturated acid would appear in the $\\sim1620-\\sim1680\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ region.\n    - **Ester (Acyclic, Unsaturated):** Lacks the broad $O-H$ stretch of an acid. It shows a strong $C=O$ stretch, typically in the range $\\sim1715-\\sim1750\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Conjugation with a $C=C$ bond slightly lowers this frequency compared to a saturated ester. A $C=C$ stretch would also be observed near $\\sim1640\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    - **Ester (Lactone):** Lacks the broad $O-H$ stretch. The $C=O$ stretching frequency is highly dependent on ring strain. For a five-membered $\\gamma$-lactone (a common isomer for this formula, e.g., $\\gamma$-valerolactone), the frequency is elevated to $\\sim1760-\\sim1780\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. For a six-membered $\\delta$-lactone, it is similar to an acyclic ester ($\\sim1735-\\sim1750\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$), but for a four-membered $\\beta$-lactone, it is very high ($\\sim1820\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). The high frequency of a strained lactone is a strong diagnostic tool.\n\n- **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    - **Carboxylic Acid:** Can show a peak for the loss of water, $[M-18]^+$ at $m/z=82$, although this can also be a thermal artifact. Alpha-cleavage can lead to loss of $-\\text{OH}$ ($[M-17]^+$) or $-\\text{COOH}$ ($[M-45]^+$). McLafferty rearrangement is common if a $\\gamma$-hydrogen is present, leading to characteristic even-mass fragments.\n    - **Ester (Acyclic):** Fragmentation is dominated by processes centered on the ester group.\n        - **$\\alpha$-cleavage:** generates acylium ions ($RCO^+$). For example, ethyl acrylate ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CHCOOCH}_2\\text{CH}_3$) would give $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CHCO}^+$ at $m/z=55$. Isopropenyl acetate ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOC}(\\text{CH}_3)=\\text{CH}_2$) would give $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO}^+$ at $m/z=43$.\n        - **McLafferty rearrangement:** occurs if there is a $\\gamma$-hydrogen in the alcohol or acid portion, leading to loss of an alkene.\n    - **Lactone:** The cyclic structure leads to characteristic fragmentation patterns. Prominent pathways include loss of carbon monoxide, $[M-28]^+$ at $m/z=72$, or decarboxylation (loss of carbon dioxide), $[M-44]^+$ at $m/z=56$. Ring opening followed by subsequent fragmentation is also common, which can lead to fragments like $m/z=55$ or $m/z=56$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. DBE is $2$. Plausible classes are: cyclic esters (lactones), unsaturated esters, and unsaturated carboxylic acids. Cyclic anhydrides are excluded by the oxygen count, since an anhydride requires $O_3$ per molecule. Discriminating IR features: a lactone carbonyl shows a relatively high stretching frequency near $\\sim1760$–$\\sim1780\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ due to ring strain and the absence of hydrogen bonding; an acyclic ester carbonyl appears near $\\sim1735$–$\\sim1750\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and, if the structure is unsaturated, an alkene $C=C$ band appears near $\\sim1640\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; an unsaturated carboxylic acid shows a carbonyl near $\\sim1705$–$\\sim1715\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ together with a very broad, intense $O\\!-\\!H$ stretch spanning $\\sim2500$–$\\sim3300\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. An anhydride would exhibit two carbonyl bands (antisymmetric and symmetric) near $\\sim1820$ and $\\sim1760\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, but cannot occur here given $O_2$. Discriminating MS features for $M^+$ at $m/z\\,100$: acids frequently show $M-18$ ($m/z\\,82$) from dehydration under electron ionization; esters exhibit $\\alpha$-cleavage to yield an acylium ion at $m/z\\,43$ and, if unsaturated, allylic-type cations near $m/z\\,55$; lactones frequently show decarboxylation $M-44$ ($m/z\\,56$) or loss of carbon monoxide $M-28$ ($m/z\\,72$), and often a prominent $m/z\\,55$ fragment from ring-opening allylic/acylium-stabilized cations.**\n- This option correctly calculates the DBE as $2$.\n- It correctly enumerates the plausible functional classes based on DBE and the number of oxygen atoms, and correctly excludes anhydrides with the correct reasoning.\n- The IR spectroscopic predictions are accurate and specific for each class: the high-frequency lactone carbonyl, the standard ester carbonyl, the broad carboxylic acid O-H stretch, and the conjugated acid carbonyl are all described correctly. The hypothetical anhydride signature is also correct.\n- The MS fragmentation patterns described are all characteristic and plausible for representative isomers within each class ($M-18$ for acids, acylium ions like $m/z\\,43$ or $m/z\\,55$ for esters, and neutral losses of $CO$ or $CO_2$ for lactones).\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. DBE is $1$. Plausible classes are: saturated esters, saturated carboxylic acids, and cyclic anhydrides. Discriminating IR features: all three will show a single carbonyl band near $\\sim1710$–$\\sim1730\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; anhydrides are identified primarily by the same single band. Discriminating MS features: all three show a dominant $m/z\\,43$ acylium ion and no characteristic neutral losses.**\n- The DBE calculation is incorrect ($1$ instead of $2$).\n- The enumeration of plausible classes is incorrect (e.g., saturated compounds have a DBE of $1$ or $0$, not $2$; anhydrides are impossible).\n- The IR description is grossly inaccurate; it ignores the broad acid O-H, wrongly claims anhydrides have a single C=O band, and gives an imprecise range for carbonyls.\n- The MS description is factually wrong; characteristic neutral losses are common, and not all classes form a $m/z\\,43$ ion.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. DBE is $2$. Plausible classes are: acyclic esters and carboxylic acids only; cyclic esters (lactones) and cyclic anhydrides are excluded because rings are incompatible with $DBE=2$. Discriminating IR features: carboxylic acids show a sharp $O\\!-\\!H$ stretch at $\\sim3600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and carbonyl at $\\sim1750\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; esters show two distinct $C=O$ bands near $\\sim1820$ and $\\sim1760\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Discriminating MS features: esters show $M-18$ ($m/z\\,82$) from dehydration; acids show $M-44$ ($m/z\\,56$) from $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ loss.**\n- The reason for excluding lactones is fallacious; a lactone has $DBE=2$ (1 ring + 1 $\\pi$ bond).\n- The IR description is wrong: carboxylic acid O-H stretches are very broad, not sharp at $\\sim3600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The description of two C=O bands for esters is the signature of an anhydride.\n- The MS fragmentation patterns are swapped or misrepresented. Dehydration is more characteristic of acids, not esters.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. DBE is $2$. Plausible classes are: acyclic esters, cyclic anhydrides, and saturated carboxylic acids. Discriminating IR features: cyclic anhydrides are identified by a single strong band near $\\sim1700\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; esters by a lower-frequency band near $\\sim1680\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; acids by a narrow $O\\!-\\!H$ stretch near $\\sim3600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Discriminating MS features: acids lack $M-18$ because the $O\\!-\\!H$ bond is not labile under electron ionization, while anhydrides show a characteristic $M-18$ loss; esters do not form acylium ions at $m/z\\,43$ under electron ionization.**\n- The enumeration of classes is wrong: cyclic anhydrides are impossible ($O_2$ vs $O_3$), and saturated carboxylic acids have $DBE=1$.\n- The IR descriptions are rife with errors: anhydrides have two high-frequency C=O bands, $\\sim1680\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is too low for an ester C=O, and acid O-H is broad.\n- The MS analysis contains multiple falsehoods: acids can show $M-18$, anhydrides cannot lose water, and esters are well-known to form acylium ions.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly and completely follows the requested procedure and provides factually sound spectroscopic reasoning.",
