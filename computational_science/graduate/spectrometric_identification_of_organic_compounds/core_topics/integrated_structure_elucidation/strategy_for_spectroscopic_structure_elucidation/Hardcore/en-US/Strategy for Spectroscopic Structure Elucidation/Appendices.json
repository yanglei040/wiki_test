While a standard $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ NMR spectrum shows all carbon environments, spectral editing techniques like Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT) are used to specifically filter signals based on the number of attached protons. This practice  challenges you to predict the outcome of DEPT-90 and DEPT-135 experiments from first principles, a core skill for unambiguously assigning carbon types ($\\mathrm{CH}$, $\\mathrm{CH_2}$, and $\\mathrm{CH_3}$) and accelerating the process of solving a molecular puzzle.",

Consider an unknown organic molecule whose carbon framework is known a priori to consist of $1$ quaternary aromatic carbon (no directly attached hydrogen), $2$ aromatic methine carbons ($\\mathrm{C_{ar}\\!-\\!H}$), $1$ aliphatic methylene ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$), and $1$ aliphatic methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$). You acquire carbon-$13$ ($^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$) spectra using DEPT-$90$ and DEPT-$135$ under ideal conditions: uniform $^{\\text{1}}J_{\\text{CH}}$ matching, perfect $90^{\\circ}$/$135^{\\circ}$ pulse calibration, complete decoupling during acquisition, and conventional phase cycling, with all spectra properly phased to the conventional display.

The molecular fragment described is chemically plausible, and the specified chemical shift ranges are representative for these carbon types. All aspects are firmly rooted in the physics of magnetic resonance and analytical chemistry.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. The composition of the molecule is explicitly defined. The experimental conditions are idealized to remove ambiguity and test the core understanding of the DEPT sequence. The assumption of no signal overlap ensures a unique, predictable outcome for the number of signals. A single, correct answer can be derived from the provided information.\n\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms (e.g., \"$1$ quaternary... carbon\", \"DEPT-$90$\", \"$135^{\\circ}$ pulse\"). There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem for spectroscopic structure elucidation. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe DEPT pulse sequence edits a $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ spectrum based on the number of protons ($n$) directly attached to each carbon. It operates by transferring polarization from $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ to $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$. Consequently, quaternary carbons ($\\mathrm{C_q}$), which have no attached protons ($n=0$), do not receive polarization transfer and are therefore absent (nulled) in all DEPT spectra.\n\nThe final step of the DEPT sequence is a proton pulse with a variable flip angle, $\\theta$. The phase and intensity of the observed $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ signal for a $\\mathrm{CH}_n$ group is a function of both $n$ and $\\theta$. Under ideal conditions (with delays optimized for a specific $^{\\text{1}}J_{\\text{CH}}$), the observable $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ magnetization for different carbon types scales as follows:\n-   $\\mathrm{CH}$: $\\propto \\sin(\\theta)$\n-   $\\mathrm{CH}_2$: $\\propto \\sin(2\\theta)$\n-   $\\mathrm{CH}_3$: $\\propto \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(\\theta) + \\sin(3\\theta))$\n\nWe will apply these relationships to the two specified experiments.\n\n**1. DEPT-90 Experiment ($\\theta = 90^\\circ$):**\n\n-   **Quaternary C ($\\mathrm{C_q}$, $n=0$):** No polarization transfer. **Signal is absent.**\n-   **Methine CH ($n=1$):** The signal intensity is proportional to $\\sin(90^\\circ) = +1$. The a_priori two aromatic methine carbons will each produce a **positive signal** in the aromatic region ($\\delta \\approx 110$–$160$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$).\n-   **Methylene CH$_2$ ($n=2$):** The signal intensity is proportional to $\\sin(2 \\times 90^\\circ) = \\sin(180^\\circ) = 0$. The methylene carbon signal is **absent (nulled)**.\n-   **Methyl CH$_3$ ($n=3$):** The signal intensity is proportional to $\\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(90^\\circ) + \\sin(3 \\times 90^\\circ)) = \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(90^\\circ) + \\sin(270^\\circ)) = \\frac{3}{4}(+1 + (-1)) = 0$. The methyl carbon signal is **absent (nulled)**.\n\n**Summary for DEPT-90:** The spectrum will show exactly $2$ signals, both positive, corresponding to the $2$ aromatic methine ($\\mathrm{C_{ar}\\!-\\!H}$) carbons.\n\n**2. DEPT-135 Experiment ($\\theta = 135^\\circ$):**\n\n-   **Quaternary C ($\\mathrm{C_q}$, $n=0$):** No polarization transfer. **Signal is absent.**\n-   **Methine CH ($n=1$):** The signal intensity is proportional to $\\sin(135^\\circ) = +\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx +0.707$. The two aromatic methine carbons will each produce a **positive signal**.\n-   **Methylene CH$_2$ ($n=2$):** The signal intensity is proportional to $\\sin(2 \\times 135^\\circ) = \\sin(270^\\circ) = -1$. The aliphatic methylene carbon will produce a **negative signal**.\n-   **Methyl CH$_3$ ($n=3$):** The signal intensity is proportional to $\\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(135^\\circ) + \\sin(3 \\times 135^\\circ)) = \\frac{3}{4}(\\sin(135^\\circ) + \\sin(405^\\circ))$. Since $405^\\circ = 360^\\circ + 45^\\circ$, $\\sin(405^\\circ) = \\sin(45^\\circ) = +\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Also, $\\sin(135^\\circ) = +\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. So the intensity is proportional to $\\frac{3}{4}(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \\frac{3}{4}(\\sqrt{2}) > 0$. The aliphatic methyl carbon will produce a **positive signal**.\n\n**Summary for DEPT-135:** The spectrum will show a total of $4$ signals:\n-   $3$ positive signals: $2$ from the aromatic methines ($\\mathrm{C_{ar}\\!-\\!H}$) and $1$ from the aliphatic methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$).\n-   $1$ negative signal: $1$ from the aliphatic methylene ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. DEPT-$90$: $2$ signals, both in the aromatic region. DEPT-$135$: $3$ positive signals (two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$ and one $\\mathrm{CH_3}$) and $1$ negative signal (the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$); the quaternary aromatic carbon is absent in both.**\n-   **DEPT-$90$ Description:** This matches our derivation perfectly. Only the $2$ methine ($\\mathrm{CH}$) carbons appear, which are in the aromatic region.\n-   **DEPT-$135$ Description:** This also matches our derivation perfectly. The $2$ aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$ and $1$ aliphatic $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ are positive. The $1$ aliphatic $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ is negative. The quaternary carbon is absent.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. DEPT-$90$: $3$ signals (two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$ and one $\\mathrm{CH_3}$). DEPT-$135$: $2$ positive signals (the two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$) and $2$ negative signals (the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_3}$); the quaternary aromatic carbon is absent in both.**\n-   **DEPT-$90$ Description:** This is incorrect. The signal for the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group is nulled in a DEPT-$90$ experiment.\n-   **DEPT-$135$ Description:** This is incorrect. The signal for the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group is positive, not negative.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. DEPT-$90$: $0$ signals because proton decoupling removes all multiplicities. DEPT-$135$: $4$ negative signals (including the quaternary aromatic carbon); no positive signals.**\n-   **DEPT-$90$ Description:** This statement is based on a fundamental misunderstanding. Proton decoupling during acquisition simplifies multiplets to singlets; it does not eliminate the signals selected by the DEPT editing sequence. DEPT-$90$ specifically selects for $\\mathrm{CH}$ signals.\n-   **DEPT-$135$ Description:** This is incorrect on multiple grounds. $\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ signals are positive, not negative. The quaternary carbon is absent as it cannot be polarized.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. DEPT-$90$: $2$ signals, both in the aromatic region. DEPT-$135$: $2$ positive signals (two aromatic $\\mathrm{CH}$) and $1$ negative signal (the $\\mathrm{CH_2}$); the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ is absent, and the quaternary aromatic carbon appears weakly in DEPT-$135$ at positive phase.**\n-   **DEPT-$90$ Description:** This part of the statement is correct.\n-   **DEPT-$135$ Description:** This is incorrect. It claims the $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ signal is absent, whereas our derivation shows it must be present and positive. It also claims the quaternary carbon appears weakly; under the stated \"ideal conditions\" based on $^{\\text{1}}J_{\\text{CH}}$ coupling, this is not expected.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

Consider the ester $n$-butyl acetate, which has the molecular formula $\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$. In EI, a molecule undergoes removal of one electron to form a radical cation, and subsequent unimolecular fragmentations conserve charge and mass.

The conditional probabilities for each feature given each candidate structure are specified as follows:\n   - For $S_{1}$ (benzyl acetate): $P(F_{91}=1\\mid S_{1})=0.85$, $P(F_{77}=1\\mid S_{1})=0.30$, $P(L_{60}=1\\mid S_{1})=0.90$, $P(C_{\\mathrm{COSY}}=1\\mid S_{1})=0.95$, $P(H_{\\mathrm{HMBC}}=1\\mid S_{1})=0.80$, $P(C_{\\mathrm{C=O}}=1\\mid S_{1})=0.98$.\n   - For $S_{2}$ ($p$-ethylbenzene): $P(F_{91}=1\\mid S_{2})=0.80$, $P(F_{77}=1\\mid S_{2})=0.60$, $P(L_{60}=1\\mid S_{2})=0.05$, $P(C_{\\mathrm{COSY}}=1\\mid S_{2})=0.95$, $P(H_{\\mathrm{HMBC}}=1\\mid S_{2})=0.10$, $P(C_{\\mathrm{C=O}}=1\\mid S_{2})=0.02$.\n3. The prior probabilities over the candidate structures reflect the sample source and library context: $P(S_{1})=0.40$ and $P(S_{2})=0.60$.\n\nUsing these assumptions and values, compute the posterior probability $P(S_{1}\\mid D)$ where $D$ represents the joint observation $F_{91}=1$, $F_{77}=0$, $L_{60}=1$, $C_{\\mathrm{COSY}}=1$, $H_{\\mathrm{HMBC}}=1$, $C_{\\mathrm{C=O}}=1$. Express your final answer as a decimal and round your result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in probabilistic inference applied to chemical structure elucidation. All necessary data and assumptions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability of the candidate structure $S_{1}$ (benzyl acetate) given the observed spectrometric and spectroscopic dataset $D$. The dataset $D$ consists of the joint observation of six binary features: $F_{91}=1$, $F_{77}=0$, $L_{60}=1$, $C_{\\mathrm{COSY}}=1$, $H_{\\mathrm{HMBC}}=1$, and $C_{\\mathrm{C=O}}=1$. This posterior probability, $P(S_{1}\\mid D)$, is calculated using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(S_{1}\\mid D) = \\frac{P(D\\mid S_{1})P(S_{1})}{P(D)}$$\nThe total probability of observing the data, $P(D)$, is given by the law of total probability, marginalizing over the two possible structures $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$:\n$$P(D) = P(D\\mid S_{1})P(S_{1}) + P(D\\mid S_{2})P(S_{2})$$\nCombining these, the full expression for the posterior probability is:\n$$P(S_{1}\\mid D) = \\frac{P(D\\mid S_{1})P(S_{1})}{P(D\\mid S_{1})P(S_{1}) + P(D\\mid S_{2})P(S_{2})}$$\nThe problem states that the individual features are conditionally independent given the structure. Therefore, the likelihood of observing the dataset $D$ given a structure $S_{i}$ is the product of the conditional probabilities of each individual feature observation:\n$$P(D\\mid S_{i}) = P(F_{91}=1\\mid S_{i}) \\times P(F_{77}=0\\mid S_{i}) \\times P(L_{60}=1\\mid S_{i}) \\times P(C_{\\mathrm{COSY}}=1\\mid S_{i}) \\times P(H_{\\mathrm{HMBC}}=1\\mid S_{i}) \\times P(C_{\\mathrm{C=O}}=1\\mid S_{i})$$\nThe problem provides probabilities for the features being present (equal to $1$). One of the observations is $F_{77}=0$. The probability for this absence must be calculated from the given probability of presence using the complement rule: $P(F_{77}=0\\mid S_{i}) = 1 - P(F_{77}=1\\mid S_{i})$.\n\nFor structure $S_{1}$:\n$$P(F_{77}=0\\mid S_{1}) = 1 - P(F_{77}=1\\mid S_{1}) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\nFor structure $S_{2}$:\n$$P(F_{77}=0\\mid S_{2}) = 1 - P(F_{77}=1\\mid S_{2}) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\n\nNow, we can compute the likelihood $P(D\\mid S_{1})$ for benzyl acetate:\n$$P(D\\mid S_{1}) = P(F_{91}=1\\mid S_{1}) \\times P(F_{77}=0\\mid S_{1}) \\times P(L_{60}=1\\mid S_{1}) \\times P(C_{\\mathrm{COSY}}=1\\mid S_{1}) \\times P(H_{\\mathrm{HMBC}}=1\\mid S_{1}) \\times P(C_{\\mathrm{C=O}}=1\\mid S_{1})$$\n$$P(D\\mid S_{1}) = 0.85 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.98$$\n$$P(D\\mid S_{1}) = 0.3988404$$\n\nNext, we compute the likelihood $P(D\\mid S_{2})$ for $p$-ethylbenzene:\n$$P(D\\mid S_{2}) = P(F_{91}=1\\mid S_{2}) \\times P(F_{77}=0\\mid S_{2}) \\times P(L_{60}=1\\mid S_{2}) \\times P(C_{\\mathrm{COSY}}=1\\mid S_{2}) \\times P(H_{\\mathrm{HMBC}}=1\\mid S_{2}) \\times P(C_{\\mathrm{C=O}}=1\\mid S_{2})$$\n$$P(D\\mid S_{2}) = 0.80 \\times 0.40 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.10 \\times 0.02$$\n$$P(D\\mid S_{2}) = 0.0000304$$\n\nWe are given the prior probabilities $P(S_{1}) = 0.40$ and $P(S_{2}) = 0.60$. We now compute the two terms in the denominator of Bayes' theorem.\nThe joint probability of observing $D$ and the structure being $S_{1}$ is:\n$$P(D\\mid S_{1})P(S_{1}) = 0.3988404 \\times 0.40 = 0.15953616$$\nThe joint probability of observing $D$ and the structure being $S_{2}$ is:\n$$P(D\\mid S_{2})P(S_{2}) = 0.0000304 \\times 0.60 = 0.00001824$$\n\nThe total probability of the evidence, $P(D)$, is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(D) = 0.15953616 + 0.00001824 = 0.1595544$$\n\nFinally, we compute the posterior probability of $S_{1}$:\n$$P(S_{1}\\mid D) = \\frac{P(D\\mid S_{1})P(S_{1})}{P(D)} = \\frac{0.15953616}{0.1595544}$$\n$$P(S_{1}\\mid D) \\approx 0.999885694$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant digit is $8$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$P(S_{1}\\mid D) \\approx 0.9999$$",
