One of the most fundamental techniques for characterizing these protons is to measure the change in their chemical shift as a function of temperature. This practice focuses on quantifying this effect by calculating the temperature coefficient, $d\\delta/dT$, which serves as a key indicator of a proton's involvement in hydrogen bonding. Understanding this relationship is a vital skill for interpreting spectra in fields ranging from synthetic chemistry to structural biology.",

The temperature dependence of the chemical shift of protons involved in hydrogen bonding (like amide $N-H$ protons) is a well-established phenomenon in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The provided chemical shift values are typical for amide protons, and the observed trend (decreasing $\\delta$ with increasing $T$) is characteristic of the disruption of hydrogen bonds upon heating. The problem is firmly based on fundamental principles of NMR.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

For a linear function, the derivative is constant and is equal to the slope of the line representing the function. The definition of a derivative can be approximated by the finite difference ratio over a small interval. Given the linearity assumption, this approximation becomes an exact calculation for the constant slope.\n\nThe slope is calculated as the change in the dependent variable ($\\delta$) divided by the change in the independent variable ($T$), often expressed as \"rise over run\". Using the two provided data points, $(T_1, \\delta_1)$ and $(T_2, \\delta_2)$, the temperature coefficient is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta\\delta}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{\\delta_{2} - \\delta_{1}}{T_{2} - T_{1}}\n$$\nThe given values are:\n$\\delta_1 = 8.30$ ppm\n$T_1 = 298$ K\n$\\delta_2 = 8.10$ ppm\n$T_2 = 318$ K\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in chemical shift, $\\Delta\\delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\delta = \\delta_{2} - \\delta_{1} = 8.10 \\text{ ppm} - 8.30 \\text{ ppm} = -0.20 \\text{ ppm}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the change in temperature, $\\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1} = 318 \\text{ K} - 298 \\text{ K} = 20 \\text{ K}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the temperature coefficient:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta}{dT} = \\frac{-0.20 \\text{ ppm}}{20 \\text{ K}} = -0.01 \\text{ ppm K}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $-0.01$ must be expressed with three significant figures, which is $-0.0100$. Therefore, the temperature coefficient is $-0.0100$ ppm K⁻¹.\n\n**Interpretation of the Sign:**\nThe calculated temperature coefficient $\\frac{d\\delta}{dT}$ is negative. This signifies that an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in the observed chemical shift, $\\delta$. This phenomenon is a classic indicator of a proton's involvement in hydrogen bonding.\n- The amide $N-H$ proton acts as a hydrogen bond donor.\n- This hydrogen bonding causes a withdrawal of electron density from the proton, an effect known as deshielding. Deshielding shifts the proton's resonance to a higher frequency, resulting in a larger chemical shift value (a downfield shift).\n- As the temperature increases, the thermal energy of the system increases, leading to the disruption and weakening of these intermolecular hydrogen bonds.\n- With reduced hydrogen bonding, the proton becomes more electronically shielded. Increased shielding shifts the proton's resonance to a lower frequency, resulting in a smaller chemical shift value (an upfield shift).\n- Consequently, the negative sign of $\\frac{d\\delta}{dT}$ confirms that the amide proton is involved in hydrogen bonding that is attenuated upon heating.",

All necessary data ($\\delta$ values, $pK_a$, $pH$, number of protons for each species) are provided to calculate a unique value for the observed chemical shift.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from any subjective or speculative content.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and unambiguous. It is a valid problem. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Principles and Qualitative Analysis\n\nThe chemical shift, $\\delta$, of a nucleus in NMR spectroscopy is a measure of its resonance frequency relative to a standard. This frequency is determined by the local magnetic field, $B_{\\mathrm{loc}}$, experienced by the nucleus. As given, $B_{\\mathrm{loc}} = B_0(1 - \\sigma)$, where $B_0$ is the strong external magnetic field and $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant. The shielding constant $\\sigma$ quantifies the extent to which the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus counteracts the external field. A higher electron density around a nucleus leads to greater shielding (larger $\\sigma$), a smaller $B_{\\mathrm{loc}}$, a lower resonance frequency, and consequently a smaller (more upfield) chemical shift $\\delta$. Conversely, factors that reduce electron density cause deshielding (smaller $\\sigma$) and a larger (more downfield) chemical shift.\n\nIn the context of heteroatom-bound protons ($N-H$, $O-H$), the protonation state significantly alters the local electronic environment. When the amine $RCH_2NH_2$ is protonated to form its conjugate acid $RCH_2NH_3^+$, a formal positive charge is placed on the nitrogen atom. Nitrogen is an electronegative atom, and this positive charge makes it strongly electron-withdrawing. This inductive effect pulls electron density away from the attached hydrogen atoms. This reduction in electron density around the $N-H$ protons leads to significant deshielding (a decrease in $\\sigma$) and thus a large downfield shift in their resonance frequency. This explains why $\\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,prot}} = 8.2\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ is much larger than $\\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} = 1.3\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. Additionally, the protons of the ammonium ion $RCH_2NH_3^+$ are more acidic and form stronger hydrogen bonds with the aqueous solvent compared to the protons of the neutral amine $RCH_2NH_2$. Hydrogen bonding also deshields protons, further contributing to the downfield shift of the ammonium protons.\n\nThe equilibrium between the conjugate acid ($BH^+$) and the neutral base ($B$) is governed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10} \\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}$$\nwhere $[B]$ is the concentration of $RCH_2NH_2$ and $[BH^+]$ is the concentration of $RCH_2NH_3^+$.\n\n#### Derivation of the Observed Chemical Shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(pH)$\n\nThe problem states that proton exchange is fast on the NMR timescale. This means that the NMR spectrometer does not detect separate signals for the $N-H$ protons of $RCH_2NH_2$ and $RCH_2NH_3^+$. Instead, it observes a single, sharp resonance at a chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, which is the weighted average of the chemical shifts of the two species.\n\nThe crucial point, as highlighted in the problem, is that the weighting must account for the different number of protons in each species. The observed signal is an average over the entire population of $N-H$ protons. Let $P_B$ and $P_{BH^+}$ be the mole fractions of the neutral base and the conjugate acid, respectively, such that $P_B + P_{BH^+} = 1$.\n\nThe relative number of protons contributed by the base species is $2 \\cdot P_B$.\nThe relative number of protons contributed by the acid species is $3 \\cdot P_{BH^+}$.\nThe total relative number of $N-H$ protons is $2 \\cdot P_B + 3 \\cdot P_{BH^+}$.\n\nThe observed chemical shift $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is the average of the individual shifts, weighted by the fractional population of protons in each chemical environment:\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{(\\text{fraction of protons from } B) \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} + (\\text{fraction of protons from } BH^+) \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,prot}}}{\\text{total fraction}} $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{ (2 \\cdot P_B) \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} + (3 \\cdot P_{BH^+}) \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,prot}} }{ 2 \\cdot P_B + 3 \\cdot P_{BH^+} } $$\n\nWe find the mole fractions $P_B$ and $P_{BH^+}$ from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let $r = \\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]} = \\frac{P_B}{P_{BH^+}}$. Then $r = 10^{(pH - pK_a)}$.\nSince $P_B + P_{BH^+} = 1$, we have $P_{BH^+} \\cdot r + P_{BH^+} = 1$, which gives:\n$$ P_{BH^+} = \\frac{1}{1+r} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}} $$\n$$ P_B = \\frac{r}{1+r} = \\frac{10^{(pH - pK_a)}}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}} $$\n\nThis gives the full functional dependence of $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ on $pH$:\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(pH) = \\frac{ 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^{(pH - pK_a)}}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}\\right) \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}\\right) \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,prot}} }{ 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^{(pH - pK_a)}}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}\\right) + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}\\right) } $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(pH) = \\frac{ 2 \\cdot 10^{(pH - pK_a)} \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} + 3 \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,prot}} }{ 2 \\cdot 10^{(pH - pK_a)} + 3 } $$\n\n#### Calculation for $pH = 8.5$\n\nGiven values:\n$pH = 8.5$\n$pK_a = 9.5$\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} = 1.3\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,prot}} = 8.2\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio $r$:\n$$ r = 10^{(pH - pK_a)} = 10^{(8.5 - 9.5)} = 10^{-1} = 0.1 $$\n\nNow, calculate the mole fractions:\n$$ P_{BH^+} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{1}{1.1} $$\n$$ P_B = \\frac{0.1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{0.1}{1.1} $$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived equation for $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$:\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{ 2 \\cdot P_B \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} + 3 \\cdot P_{BH^+} \\cdot \\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,prot}} }{ 2 \\cdot P_B + 3 \\cdot P_{BH^+} } $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{ 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.1}{1.1}\\right) \\cdot (1.3) + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{1.1}\\right) \\cdot (8.2) }{ 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.1}{1.1}\\right) + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{1.1}\\right) } $$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $1/1.1$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{ 2 \\cdot (0.1) \\cdot (1.3) + 3 \\cdot (1) \\cdot (8.2) }{ 2 \\cdot (0.1) + 3 \\cdot (1) } $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{ 0.2 \\cdot (1.3) + 3 \\cdot (8.2) }{ 0.2 + 3 } $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{ 0.26 + 24.6 }{ 3.2 } $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{ 24.86 }{ 3.2 } $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 7.76875\\ \\mathrm{ppm} $$\nThis value, rounded to two decimal places, is $7.77\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **$7.77\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$**\nThis value matches our calculated result of $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 7.76875\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **$7.57\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$**\nThis value would result from using an incorrect formula that weights the chemical shifts by the mole fractions of the molecules ($P_B, P_{BH^+}$) rather than the relative number of protons.

This calculation is incorrect because it fails to account for the differing number of protons ($2$ vs. $3$) in the two exchanging species, a specific requirement of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **$2.02\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$**\nThis value is very close to the chemical shift of the free amine ($\\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} = 1.3\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$). An observed shift this low would imply that the equilibrium lies far to the side of the neutral amine, which would require the $pH$ to be significantly higher than the $pK_a$. At $pH = 8.5$, which is one unit below the $pK_a=9.5$, the protonated form dominates by a factor of $10:1$. The observed shift must therefore be much closer to $\\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,prot}} = 8.2\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ than to $\\delta_{\\mathrm{NH,free}} = 1.3\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **$4.75\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$**\nThis value is the simple arithmetic mean of the two limiting chemical shifts: $(1.3 + 8.2)/2 = 9.5/2 = 4.75\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. This calculation has no physical basis in this context. It would only be the observed result if $pH=pK_a$ (so $P_B = P_{BH^+}$) AND if one used the incorrect molecular weighting (from option B) AND if the number of protons was equal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
