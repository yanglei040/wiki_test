By using a generalized Karplus equation, you will calculate vicinal coupling constants ($^{3}J$) for key dihedral angles that define staggered conformations. This exercise is designed to build your intuition for how the magnitude of $J$ directly reflects molecular geometry, allowing you to distinguish between *gauche* and *antiperiplanar* arrangements from NMR data.

            "problem": "A vicinal proton–proton spin–spin coupling constant in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, denoted by $^{3}J$, arises primarily from through-bond transmission of spin information via the Fermi contact interaction and depends on the dihedral angle $\\phi$ between the coupled nuclei. Empirically and theoretically, $^{3}J(\\phi)$ is a $360^{\\circ}$-periodic function whose extrema correspond to specific orbital alignment configurations of the intervening bonds. Using only the physical constraints that $^{3}J(\\phi)$ is periodic in $\\phi$ with period $360^{\\circ}$, that its leading angular dependence is captured by low-order cosine harmonics consistent with bond-orbital overlap, and that substituent anisotropy can break the symmetry between $\\phi$ and $-\\phi$, derive a minimal cosine-series representation for $^{3}J(\\phi)$ with three parameters. Then, for a Karplus-type three-parameter model characterized by $A=7.0$, $B=-1.0$, and $C=0.5$, compute the values of $J(\\phi)$ at $\\phi=60^{\\circ}$, $\\phi=120^{\\circ}$, and $\\phi=180^{\\circ}$. Round your numerical results to four significant figures and express the final values in Hertz (Hz). Finally, interpret the relative magnitudes of these $J$ values in terms of conformational preferences (e.g., antiperiplanar versus gauche) and discuss what asymmetry between $\\phi=60^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi=120^{\\circ}$ implies about the substituent environment. The angle $\\phi$ should be treated in degrees throughout this problem.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, specifically the Karplus relationship. It is well-posed, providing sufficient information for a unique set of calculations and a reasoned interpretation based on established chemical theory. While there is a potential ambiguity in the discussion of symmetry, it can be resolved through a standard interpretation of the generalized Karplus equation and its underlying physical meaning, making the problem internally consistent and solvable.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested by the problem: derivation of the functional form, calculation of specific coupling constants, and interpretation of the results.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Karplus-Type Equation**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a minimal three-parameter representation for the vicinal coupling constant, $^{3}J$, as a function of the dihedral angle, $\\phi$. The given constraints are:\n1.  $^{3}J(\\phi)$ is a periodic function with a period of $360^{\\circ}$ (or $2\\pi$ radians).\n2.  The dominant angular dependence is described by low-order cosine harmonics.\n3.  The model should contain three adjustable parameters.\n\nA function that is periodic with period $2\\pi$ can be expressed as a Fourier series. The constraint to use only cosine harmonics leads to a cosine series representation:\n$$ J(\\phi) = C_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos(n\\phi) $$\nThe directive for a \"minimal\" representation with \"low-order\" harmonics implies truncating this series. A three-parameter model is achieved by including terms up to $n=2$:\n$$ J(\\phi) = C_0 + C_1 \\cos(\\phi) + C_2 \\cos(2\\phi) $$\nThis expression represents the most general three-parameter cosine series. To relate this to the more common form of the Karplus equation, we use the trigonometric identity $\\cos(2\\phi) = 2\\cos^2(\\phi) - 1$:\n$$ J(\\phi) = C_0 + C_1 \\cos(\\phi) + C_2 (2\\cos^2(\\phi) - 1) $$\nRearranging the terms by powers of $\\cos(\\phi)$ gives:\n$$ J(\\phi) = (2C_2) \\cos^2(\\phi) + C_1 \\cos(\\phi) + (C_0 - C_2) $$\nThis equation is of the general form $A \\cos^2(\\phi) + B \\cos(\\phi) + C$, where the parameters are identified as $A = 2C_2$, $B = C_1$, and $C = C_0 - C_2$. This is the widely recognized generalized Karplus equation, and its derivation from a truncated cosine series is thus demonstrated.\n\nThe problem states that \"substituent anisotropy can break the symmetry between $\\phi$ and $-\\phi$\". This would mathematically require sine terms in the Fourier expansion, as $\\sin(n\\phi)$ is an odd function. A pure cosine series, and thus the derived form $A \\cos^2(\\phi) + B \\cos(\\phi) + C$, is an even function, meaning $J(\\phi) = J(-\\phi)$. The problem then proceeds with a specific set of parameters for this symmetric form. This implies we are considering a specific case where the effects leading to $\\phi \\leftrightarrow -\\phi$ asymmetry are negligible or are being ignored in this model. However, as will be seen, the $B \\cos(\\phi)$ term introduces a different kind of asymmetry, namely with respect to $\\phi = 90^{\\circ}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Coupling Constants**\n\nThe problem provides a specific set of parameters for the Karplus-type model: $A=7.0$, $B=-1.0$, and $C=0.5$. The coupling constant is given in Hertz (Hz). The governing equation is:\n$$ J(\\phi) = 7.0 \\cos^2(\\phi) - 1.0 \\cos(\\phi) + 0.5 $$\nWe are asked to compute the values of $J(\\phi)$ for $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$, $\\phi = 120^{\\circ}$, and $\\phi = 180^{\\circ}$. Note that the arguments of trigonometric functions are in degrees.\n\nFor $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$:\n$ \\cos(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $\n$$ J(60^{\\circ}) = 7.0 (\\frac{1}{2})^2 - 1.0 (\\frac{1}{2}) + 0.5 $$\n$$ J(60^{\\circ}) = 7.0(0.25) - 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.75 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $J(60^{\\circ}) = 1.750$ Hz.\n\nFor $\\phi = 120^{\\circ}$:\n$ \\cos(120^{\\circ}) = -\\frac{1}{2} = -0.5 $\n$$ J(120^{\\circ}) = 7.0 (-\\frac{1}{2})^2 - 1.0 (-\\frac{1}{2}) + 0.5 $$\n$$ J(120^{\\circ}) = 7.0(0.25) + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.75 + 1.0 = 2.75 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $J(120^{\\circ}) = 2.750$ Hz.\n\nFor $\\phi = 180^{\\circ}$:\n$ \\cos(180^{\\circ}) = -1 $\n$$ J(180^{\\circ}) = 7.0 (-1)^2 - 1.0 (-1) + 0.5 $$\n$$ J(180^{\\circ}) = 7.0(1) + 1.0 + 0.5 = 8.5 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $J(180^{\\circ}) = 8.500$ Hz.\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of Results**\n\nThe calculated coupling constants are $J(60^{\\circ}) = 1.750$ Hz, $J(120^{\\circ}) = 2.750$ Hz, and $J(180^{\\circ}) = 8.500$ Hz.\n\n- **Conformational Preferences**: The dihedral angle $\\phi=180^{\\circ}$ corresponds to an *antiperiplanar* conformation, while $\\phi=60^{\\circ}$ corresponds to a *gauche* conformation. The results show that the coupling constant for the antiperiplanar arrangement ($8.500$ Hz) is substantially larger than for the gauche arrangement ($1.750$ Hz). This is a cornerstone of conformational analysis using NMR. The magnitude of the vicinal coupling is related to the overlap of the orbitals of the C-H bonds, which is maximized at planar arrangements ($\\phi=0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}$) and minimized at perpendicular arrangements ($\\phi=90^{\\circ}$). In freely rotating systems, a time-averaged coupling constant is observed. A large experimental $^{3}J$ value (typically $8-13$ Hz) implies a strong preference for the antiperiplanar conformer, whereas a small value (typically $1-5$ Hz) suggests a dominance of gauche conformers. The calculated values are typical for these distinct conformations.\n\n- **Asymmetry and Substituent Environment**: The problem asks to interpret the asymmetry between $J(60^{\\circ})$ and $J(120^{\\circ})$. We found $J(60^{\\circ}) = 1.750$ Hz and $J(120^{\\circ}) = 2.750$ Hz. These values are not equal. This inequality demonstrates an asymmetry in the Karplus curve with respect to $\\phi=90^{\\circ}$. In the equation $J(\\phi) = A \\cos^2(\\phi) + B \\cos(\\phi) + C$, the $A \\cos^2(\\phi)$ and $C$ terms are symmetric about $\\phi=90^{\\circ}$, since $\\cos^2(90^{\\circ}+\\delta) = \\cos^2(90^{\\circ}-\\delta)$. The $B \\cos(\\phi)$ term, however, is antisymmetric about $\\phi=90^{\\circ}$, since $\\cos(90^{\\circ}+\\delta) = -\\sin(\\delta)$ while $\\cos(90^{\\circ}-\\delta) = \\sin(\\delta)$. Thus, a non-zero value of $B$ breaks the symmetry about $\\phi=90^{\\circ}$. In our case, $B=-1.0$. The difference is $J(120^{\\circ}) - J(60^{\\circ}) = (A/4 - B/2 + C) - (A/4 + B/2 + C) = -B = -(-1.0) = 1.0$ Hz, which matches our calculation ($2.750 - 1.750 = 1.0$).\nPhysically, the $B$ parameter accounts for the influence of electronegative substituents on the carbon backbone. In a symmetric system like unsubstituted ethane ($\\text{H-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-H}$), $B$ would be close to zero. The presence of a non-zero $B$ term, and thus the asymmetry between coupling constants for angles like $60^{\\circ}$ and $120^{\\circ}$, signifies an asymmetric substituent environment, for example, due to the presence of an electronegative atom on one of the carbons, which perturbs the electronic structure of the bonding framework in an angle-dependent manner.",

Solution**\nWe will proceed with the three tasks as specified.\n\n**Part 1: Evaluation of $J_{1}(\\phi)$ and $J_{2}(\\phi)$ at $\\phi=60^{\\circ}$**\n\nThe dihedral angle is given as $\\phi=60^{\\circ}$. We first evaluate the trigonometric terms at this angle.\nThe cosine of $60^{\\circ}$ is a standard value:\n$$\n\\cos(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n$$\nThe square of the cosine is:\n$$\n\\cos^{2}(60^{\\circ}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the expressions for $J_{1}(\\phi)$ and $J_{2}(\\phi)$.\n\nFor the first parameterization, $J_{1}(\\phi)$:\n$$\nJ_{1}(60^{\\circ}) = 7.0\\cos^{2}(60^{\\circ}) - 1.0\\cos(60^{\\circ}) + 0.5\n$$\n$$\nJ_{1}(60^{\\circ}) = 7.0(0.25) - 1.0(0.5) + 0.5\n$$\n$$\nJ_{1}(60^{\\circ}) = 1.75 - 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.75 \\, \\text{Hz}\n$$\n\nFor the second parameterization, $J_{2}(\\phi)$:\n$$\nJ_{2}(60^{\\circ}) = 6.5\\cos^{2}(60^{\\circ}) - 0.8\\cos(60^{\\circ}) + 0.6\n$$\n$$\nJ_{2}(60^{\\circ}) = 6.5(0.25) - 0.8(0.5) + 0.6\n$$\n$$\nJ_{2}(60^{\\circ}) = 1.625 - 0.4 + 0.6 = 1.225 + 0.6 = 1.825 \\, \\text{Hz}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Absolute Difference $\\Delta J$**\n\nThe absolute difference, $\\Delta J$, is defined as $|J_{2}(60^{\\circ}) - J_{1}(60^{\\circ})|$. Using the values calculated in Part 1:\n$$\n\\Delta J = |1.825 - 1.75|\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta J = |0.075| = 0.075 \\, \\text{Hz}\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures, which is $0.07500$. In standard scientific notation, this is $7.500 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Justification of Parameter Leverage**\n\nThe general form of the Karplus-type equation is given as a linear combination of basis functions:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = A\\cos^{2}\\phi + B\\cos\\phi + C\n$$\nHere, the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the parameters. The \"leverage\" or influence of each parameter on the final value of $J(\\phi)$ at a specific angle can be understood by examining the sensitivity of $J$ with respect to changes in each parameter. This is rigorously quantified by the partial derivatives of $J$ with respect to $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to parameter $A$ (the coefficient of $\\cos^{2}\\phi$) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial A} = \\cos^{2}\\phi\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to parameter $B$ (the coefficient of $\\cos\\phi$) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial B} = \\cos\\phi\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to parameter $C$ (the constant term) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C} = 1\n$$\nThese derivatives represent the rate of change of $J$ for a unit change in each parameter. The magnitude of the derivative at a given angle $\\phi$ is a direct measure of the parameter's leverage at that angle.\n\nWe evaluate these leverage factors at the specified angle $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$:\n-   Leverage of parameter $A$: $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial A}\\bigg|_{\\phi=60^{\\circ}} = \\cos^{2}(60^{\\circ}) = (0.5)^{2} = 0.25$\n-   Leverage of parameter $B$: $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial B}\\bigg|_{\\phi=60^{\\circ}} = \\cos(60^{\\circ}) = 0.5$\n-   Leverage of parameter $C$: $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial C}\\bigg|_{\\phi=60^{\\circ}} = 1$\n\nComparing the magnitudes of these leverage factors:\n$$\n1 > 0.5 > 0.25\n$$\nThis inequality demonstrates that a change in the constant term, $C$, results in the largest change in the value of $J(60^{\\circ})$. Specifically, a change of $\\delta C$ in the parameter $C$ produces a change of $\\delta C$ in $J$, whereas a change of $\\delta B$ in $B$ produces a smaller change of $0.5\\delta B$, and a change of $\\delta A$ in $A$ an even smaller change of $0.25\\delta A$.\n\nTherefore, based on the functional form, the constant term exerts the greatest leverage on the value of $J(\\phi)$ at $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$.\nThe final answer to be reported is the numerical value of $\\Delta J$.\n$$\n\\Delta J = 0.07500 \\, \\text{Hz}\n$$",

            "solution": "The fundamental base is that scalar spin-spin coupling in Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) arises predominantly from the Fermi contact mechanism, which transmits spin information through bonds via electron density. For vicinal proton-proton coupling $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$, the magnitude depends on the dihedral angle $\\phi$ between the coupled protons, displaying maxima for collinear ($\\phi \\approx 0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}$) arrangements and minima when the geometry is near orthogonal ($\\phi \\approx 90^{\\circ}$). This qualitative dependence, commonly captured by Karplus-type relationships, is empirical but well supported and does not require an explicit formula here. For long-range couplings such as $^{4}J_{\\text{HH}}$, through-bond transmission can be efficient in specific “W”-type geometries, often when successive torsions are antiperiplanar and the topology provides favorable orbital overlap and hyperconjugative pathways.\n\nWe analyze the data:\n\n1. Connectivity: HSQC/HMBC assignments place $H_{a}$ on $C2$ and $H_{b}$ on $C5$, with the shortest path $C2$–$C3$–$C4$–$C5$, which is four bonds. Therefore, $H_{a}$ and $H_{b}$ are not vicinal. On connectivity grounds alone, their mutual interaction cannot be a $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$; it must be $^{4}J_{\\text{HH}}$ or higher.\n\n2. Geometry: The X-ray torsions about $C2$–$C3$ and $C3$–$C4$ are approximately $180^{\\circ}$ and $180^{\\circ}$. This produces a zig-zag alignment from $H_{a}$ to $H_{b}$ consistent with a “W” path across four bonds. Such arrangements are known to support measurable $^{4}J_{\\text{HH}}$ in saturated rings, often in the sub-hertz to few-hertz regime, matching the observed $0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$.\n\n3. Magnitude and selectivity: The interaction persists at $0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$ across $T = 238$–$315\\,\\text{K}$ and two solvents, even as other vicinal couplings shift slightly with conformational and dielectric changes. Selective irradiation of vicinal neighbors collapses only the large vicinal splittings ($8.5$–$12.0\\,\\text{Hz}$) and leaves the $0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$ intact, implying that the small splitting is not relayed via a common neighbor but arises directly between $H_{a}$ and $H_{b}$ along the multi-bond path.\n\n4. First-order behavior: The chemical shift separation between $H_{a}$ and $H_{b}$ is $0.30\\,\\text{ppm}$, corresponding to $\\Delta \\nu \\approx 180\\,\\text{Hz}$ at $600\\,\\text{MHz}$. Given $J = 0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$, the ratio $J/\\Delta \\nu \\approx 0.0044 \\ll 0.1$, well within the weak-coupling limit. Second-order effects (including virtual couplings that distort multiplets) are negligible under these conditions, and the clean, symmetric $0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$ splitting is consistent with a genuine scalar coupling constant.\n\n5. Dipolar interactions: Residual dipolar couplings require partial alignment in an anisotropic medium. The experiments are conducted in isotropic deuterated solvents, and the feature is observed as a conventional scalar splitting, not as orientation-dependent patterns. The invariance across solvents and temperatures that do not change alignment excludes residual dipolar coupling as the origin.\n\n6. NOESY: The absence of a NOESY cross-peak between $H_{a}$ and $H_{b}$ is consistent with nonproximate spatial arrangement, but NOE reflects through-space relaxation, not through-bond scalar coupling. Its absence neither argues against nor for scalar coupling; it simply indicates that the coupling is not attributable to spatial proximity.\n\nPutting these points together, the four-bond connectivity, favorable “W” geometry, magnitude in the expected range, weak COSY cross-peak (COSY can show long-range coupling if sufficiently strong), and persistence under experimental manipulations collectively support a genuine $^{4}J_{\\text{HH}}$ long-range coupling rather than a vicinal $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. It claims a weakened vicinal $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ due to $\\phi \\approx 90^{\\circ}$. While Karplus-type reasoning correctly predicts small $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ near orthogonal geometries, $H_{a}$ and $H_{b}$ are not vicinal; they are four bonds apart ($C2$–$C3$–$C4$–$C5$). Therefore, this interpretation contradicts the established connectivity. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. It attributes the $0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$ to genuine $^{4}J_{\\text{HH}}$ “W”-coupling along the $C2$–$C3$–$C4$–$C5$ path, favored by antiperiplanar torsions and supported by weak COSY, temperature/solvent invariance, and selective irradiation evidence. This matches the fundamental mechanism of through-bond coupling, the geometry, and the magnitude. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. It ascribes the feature to residual dipolar coupling from partial alignment. In isotropic solutions, residual dipolar couplings are absent, and no alignment medium is used. The observed behavior and experimental conditions contradict this explanation. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. It suggests a second-order virtual coupling artifact due to near-degenerate frequencies. The frequency separation is $180\\,\\text{Hz}$ with $J = 0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$, placing the system solidly in the first-order regime. Moreover, selective decoupling of neighbors does not abolish the $0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$ feature, which would be expected if it were a relayed artifact. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the scientifically consistent justification is that the observed $0.8\\,\\text{Hz}$ interaction is a genuine $^{4}J_{\\text{HH}}$ “W”-coupling rather than a weakened vicinal $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$.",
