            "problem": "Neopentane $\\left(\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{4}\\right)$ is a saturated hydrocarbon with a quaternary central carbon bound to four methyl groups. Consider its $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum recorded in an achiral solvent, under conditions where scalar spin–spin couplings beyond nearest neighbors can be neglected and molecular symmetry is fully expressed on the NMR timescale.

In achiral media, homotopic and enantiotopic nuclei are chemically equivalent; diastereotopic nuclei are chemically non-equivalent.\n- The number of $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR signals equals the number of distinct sets of chemically equivalent protons; the relative integral of each signal is proportional to the count of nuclei in that set.\n\nUsing these principles, determine which statement correctly identifies the homotopic protons in neopentane and predicts the number of $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR signals and their relative integrals in an achiral solvent.\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the homotopic relationships among the protons of neopentane, $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{4}$, and the resulting features of its $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum in an achiral solvent. The analysis must be based on the provided fundamental principles of chemical equivalence and stereochemical relationships.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Molecule:** Neopentane, $\\left(\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{4}\\right)$.\n- **Structure:** A quaternary central carbon bound to four methyl groups.\n- **Technique:** $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n- **Conditions:**\n    - Solvent is achiral.\n    - Molecular symmetry is fully expressed on the NMR timescale (implying fast conformational changes, such as bond rotation).\n- **Fundamental Principles Provided:**\n    1.  **Chemical Equivalence (Symmetry):** Two nuclei are chemically equivalent if they are interchanged by a symmetry operation.\n    2.  **Stereochemical Relationships (Substitution Test):**\n        - Replacement of two nuclei leads to identical molecules $\\implies$ Homotopic.\n        - Replacement leads to enantiomers $\\implies$ Enantiotopic.\n        - Replacement leads to diastereomers $\\implies$ Diastereotopic.\n    3.  **Equivalence in Achiral Solvents:** Homotopic and enantiotopic nuclei are chemically equivalent. Diastereotopic nuclei are not.\n    4.  **NMR Spectrum:**\n        - Number of signals = number of sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n        - Relative integral of a signal is proportional to the number of protons in that set.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The molecule neopentane is a real chemical compound. The principles of NMR spectroscopy, molecular symmetry (point group theory), and stereochemical relationships (homotopicity, etc.) are cornerstones of modern chemistry. The provided definitions are accurate representations of these principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific molecule, $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{4}$, under well-defined conditions (achiral solvent, fast rotation) and asks for a prediction based on established theory. The question is unambiguous and has a single, correct answer derivable from the premises.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and precise, using established scientific terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n- **Flaws:** The problem does not violate any of the enumerated flaws. It is a standard, formalizable problem in chemical spectroscopy. The mention of neglecting non-nearest-neighbor couplings is supplementary information about fine structure (multiplicity), which is not the focus of the question (number of signals and integrals), and thus does not create a contradiction or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution from First Principles\n\n1.  **Molecular Structure and Symmetry:** Neopentane, $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{4}$, consists of a central carbon atom, $C_q$, tetrahedrally bonded to four methyl groups, $-\\mathrm{CH}_3$. Due to free rotation around the four $C_q - C_{methyl}$ single bonds, which is rapid on the NMR timescale as specified, the molecule maintains an average symmetry that is very high. The four carbon atoms of the methyl groups form a regular tetrahedron around the central carbon. This arrangement belongs to the $T_d$ point group.\n\n2.  **Application of the Symmetry Principle:**\n    - The $T_d$ point group contains multiple symmetry elements that interconvert the four methyl groups. For example, there are $C_3$ rotation axes that pass through the central carbon and one of the methyl carbons. A $120^\\circ$ rotation about such an axis leaves one methyl group invariant while permuting the other three. Since we can choose any of the four methyl groups to define such an axis, it is evident that all four methyl groups are symmetrically equivalent.\n    - Furthermore, within each methyl group, the three protons are rendered equivalent by the rapid rotation about the $C-C$ bond axis. This rotation acts as a local $C_3$ operation, interchanging the three protons.\n    - By transitivity, if all methyl groups are equivalent to each other, and all protons within each methyl group are equivalent to each other, then all protons in the entire molecule must be equivalent. Specifically, any proton can be mapped onto any other proton through a combination of a whole-molecule symmetry operation (which maps one methyl group onto another) and a local bond rotation (which maps one proton onto another within the target methyl group). Therefore, all $12$ protons in neopentane belong to a single set of symmetrically equivalent nuclei.\n\n3.  **Application of the Substitution Test:**\n    - To confirm the relationship, let us apply the substitution test. Select any two protons in the molecule, $H_a$ and $H_b$, and replace each in turn with a test group $X$, generating molecules $M_a$ and $M_b$.\n        - **Case 1: $H_a$ and $H_b$ are in the same methyl group.** Rapid rotation about the $C-C$ bond interconverts their positions, making the resulting molecules $M_a$ and $M_b$ identical.\n        - **Case 2: $H_a$ and $H_b$ are in different methyl groups.** The resulting molecules, $M_a$ and $M_b$, are also identical. This can be demonstrated by rotating the entire molecule to superimpose the methyl group containing $X$ in molecule $M_b$ onto the position of the methyl group that contained $X$ in molecule $M_a$, followed by a rotation about that $C-C$ bond to align the $X$ groups.\n    - Since replacing any two protons in the molecule with a test group $X$ results in identical molecules, all $12$ protons are **homotopic**.\n\n4.  **Prediction of the $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR Spectrum:**\n    - As per the provided principles, homotopic nuclei are chemically equivalent.\n    - The number of signals is equal to the number of distinct sets of chemically equivalent protons. Since all $12$ protons constitute a single set of homotopic (and therefore chemically equivalent) nuclei, the $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum will exhibit exactly **one** signal.\n    - The relative integral of this signal is proportional to the number of protons in the set. Since the set contains all $12$ protons of the molecule, the single signal will have a relative integral value corresponding to $12$ protons.\n\n### Evaluation of Provided Options\n\n**A. All $12$ methyl protons are homotopic with one another; therefore exactly $1$ $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR signal is observed with a single integral corresponding to $12$ protons.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement correctly identifies that all $12$ protons are homotopic due to the high symmetry ($T_d$) of the neopentane molecule and the rapid internal rotations. It correctly concludes from this fact that there will be a single set of chemically equivalent protons, resulting in one $^{\\text{1}}\\text{H}$ NMR signal. The prediction that this signal integrates to $12$ protons is also correct. This conclusion is in perfect agreement with our derivation from first principles.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The four methyl groups form diastereotopic environments in an achiral medium; therefore exactly $4$ signals are observed, each integrating to $3$ protons.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. Diastereotopicity arises in molecules that lack relevant symmetry elements to interconvert the groups in question. As established, the four methyl groups of neopentane are interconverted by multiple symmetry operations ($C_3$, $S_4$, $\\sigma_d$) and are therefore homotopic, not diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and would give separate signals, but this premise is false for neopentane.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Three methyl groups are equivalent while one is distinct; therefore exactly $2$ signals are observed, integrating in a $9{:}3$ ratio.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement describes a molecule with $C_{3v}$ or $C_3$ symmetry, such as tert-butyl chloride $\\left((\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{CCl}\\right)$, not neopentane $\\left(\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_4\\right)$. In neopentane, the fourth group attached to the central carbon is another methyl group, identical to the other three, resulting in higher ($T_d$) symmetry where all four are equivalent. There is no chemical or symmetric basis to distinguish one methyl group from the others.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The methyl protons are pairwise enantiotopic within each methyl group; therefore exactly $3$ signals are observed in an achiral medium, with integrals $4{:}4{:}4$ across the molecule.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is flawed in multiple ways. Firstly, the three protons of a freely rotating methyl group are homotopic, not enantiotopic. Enantiotopicity requires a prochiral center, which is not the case here. Secondly, even if protons were enantiotopic, they are chemically equivalent (isochronous) in an achiral solvent and would produce a single signal, not multiple signals. The claim of $3$ signals contradicts the fundamental principles provided. Finally, the proposed integration of $4{:}4{:}4$ is an arbitrary partition of the $12$ protons that does not correspond to the molecular structure.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

It is a standard, well-posed problem in chemical spectroscopy and stereochemistry. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe molecule under consideration is meso-$2,3$-dichlorobutane. The structure is $\\mathrm{C_1H_3{-}C_2H(Cl){-}C_3H(Cl){-}C_4H_3}$. A meso compound is defined as a molecule that contains stereocenters but is achiral overall due to the presence of an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. In this case, $C_2$ and $C_3$ are stereocenters, and for the meso isomer, they have opposite configurations, e.g., ($2R,3S$).\n\nThe problem states to assume fast internal rotations on the NMR timescale, which means we must consider the time-averaged symmetry of the molecule. Due to free rotation about the $C_2-C_3$ bond, the molecule on average possesses a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$) that bisects the $C_2-C_3$ bond and relates the two halves of the molecule. Alternatively, we can analyze the most stable conformation, the anti-periplanar conformation, which possesses a center of inversion ($i$). Both a mirror plane ($\\sigma$) and a center of inversion ($i$) are improper axes of rotation ($\\sigma = S_1$, $i = S_2$).\n\nWe will use the principles mandated by the problem to determine the number of $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ NMR signals.\n\n**1. Analysis using Symmetry Operations:**\nThe first principle states that nuclei related by a symmetry operation of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n-   The plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$) or the center of inversion ($i$) maps a carbon atom from one side of the molecule to its counterpart on the other side.\n-   Specifically, $C_1$ is mapped onto $C_4$ (and $C_4$ onto $C_1$). Thus, $\\{C_1, C_4\\}$ form a set of symmetry-equivalent nuclei.\n-   Similarly, $C_2$ is mapped onto $C_3$ (and $C_3$ onto $C_2$). Thus, $\\{C_2, C_3\\}$ form a second set of symmetry-equivalent nuclei.\n-   Based on symmetry, there are two distinct sets of carbon atoms: $\\{C_1, C_4\\}$ and $\\{C_2, C_3\\}$. This predicts **2 signals** in the $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ NMR spectrum. One signal represents two methyl carbons (degeneracy $2$), and the other represents two methine carbons (degeneracy $2$).\n\n**2. Analysis using Substitution Test and Stereochemical Relationships:**\nThis analysis determines the precise relationship (homotopic, enantiotopic, or diastereotopic) between the symmetry-equivalent nuclei.\n-   **Relationship between $C_1$ and $C_4$:** The symmetry operation relating $C_1$ and $C_4$ is an improper rotation ($S_n$, where $n=1$ for $\\sigma$ or $n=2$ for $i$). Nuclei related by an improper axis of rotation, but not by a proper one, are **enantiotopic**. Let's confirm with the substitution test.\n    -   Let's replace $C_1$ with an isotopic label (e.g., $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$, though any label works conceptually) in the meso-($2R,3S$) molecule, creating molecule M1. M1 is ($2R,3S$)-2,3-dichloro[1-$^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$]butane. This molecule is chiral as the label destroys the internal symmetry.\n    -   Let's replace $C_4$ with the same label, creating molecule M2. M2 is ($2R,3S$)-2,3-dichloro[4-$^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$]butane. To compare M1 and M2, let's rename M2 by IUPAC rules starting from the labeled end. It becomes ($2S,3R$)-2,3-dichloro[1-$^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$]butane.\n    -   The relationship between a ($2R,3S$) molecule and a ($2S,3R$) molecule with the same connectivity is that they are enantiomers. Since M1 and M2 are enantiomers, the nuclei $C_1$ and $C_4$ are **enantiotopic**.\n\n-   **Relationship between $C_2$ and $C_3$**: The symmetry operation relating $C_2$ and $C_3$ is also an improper rotation ($i$ or $\\sigma$). Thus, they are also **enantiotopic**.\n    -   Let's use the substitution test. Replace $C_2$ with an isotope $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ in the meso-($2R,3S$) molecule. We get meso-2,3-dichloro[2-$^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$]butane, where the label is at the $R$ center.\n    -   Replace $C_3$ with an isotope $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$. We get meso-2,3-dichloro[3-$^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$]butane, where the label is at the $S$ center.\n    -   These two resulting molecules are mirror images of each other and are non-superimposable. They are enantiomers. Thus, the nuclei $C_2$ and $C_3$ are **enantiotopic**.\n\n**3. Prediction of NMR Spectrum:**\nThe third principle states that in an achiral medium, enantiotopic nuclei are chemically equivalent (isochronous), while diastereotopic nuclei are not.\n-   The experiment is conducted in an achiral solvent.\n-   The pair $\\{C_1, C_4\\}$ is enantiotopic, so these two carbons are chemically equivalent and produce a single resonance.\n-   The pair $\\{C_2, C_3\\}$ is enantiotopic, so these two carbons are also chemically equivalent and produce a single resonance, distinct from the first.\n-   Therefore, the final prediction is **2 signals** in the proton-decoupled $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ NMR spectrum. The signal for $\\{C_1, C_4\\}$ has a degeneracy of $2$, and the signal for $\\{C_2, C_3\\}$ also has a degeneracy of $2$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. There are $2$ signals: one for $\\{C_1,C_4\\}$ and one for $\\{C_2,C_3\\}$, each with degeneracy $2$. The mirror plane maps $C_1 \\leftrightarrow C_4$ and $C_2 \\leftrightarrow C_3$, making each pair enantiotopic and therefore $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$-equivalent in an achiral medium.**\n-   This statement correctly predicts $2$ signals.\n-   It correctly identifies the equivalent sets of carbons as $\\{C_1, C_4\\}$ and $\\{C_2, C_3\\}$, each with degeneracy $2$.\n-   It correctly identifies the symmetry element (mirror plane) responsible for the relationship.\n-   It correctly identifies the stereochemical relationship as **enantiotopic**, which is the result of being related by a mirror plane.\n-   It correctly states the NMR consequence: enantiotopic nuclei are equivalent in an achiral medium.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. There are $3$ signals: $\\{C_1,C_4\\}$ remain equivalent (degeneracy $2$), but $C_2$ and $C_3$ are diastereotopic and give separate signals (each degeneracy $1$) because they are stereogenic centers.**\n-   The number of signals ($3$) is incorrect.\n-   The reasoning that $C_2$ and $C_3$ are diastereotopic is incorrect. They are related by a plane of symmetry/center of inversion, making them enantiotopic. The presence of a stereocenter does not automatically make other centers diastereotopic *to it* in this symmetric context.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. There are $4$ signals: all $4$ carbons are magnetically non-equivalent in $^{\\text{13}}\\text{C}$ NMR because the molecule contains stereocenters.**\n-   The number of signals ($4$) is incorrect.\n-   This reasoning completely ignores the overall molecular symmetry of the meso compound. While the molecule contains stereocenters, it is achiral, and the symmetry leads to chemical equivalence. A chiral, asymmetric molecule like ($2R,3R$)-2,3-dichlorobutane would indeed show $4$ signals. This is not the case for the meso isomer.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. There are $2$ signals: one for $\\{C_1,C_4\\}$ and one for $\\{C_2,C_3\\}$, each with degeneracy $2$, but the equivalence within each pair is homotopic (not enantiotopic) because a mirror plane is a proper symmetry operation that makes the replacements identical rather than enantiomeric.**\n-   The number of signals ($2$) and the assignments are correct.\n-   The claimed stereochemical relationship (homotopic) is incorrect. Homotopic nuclei are related by a proper axis of rotation ($C_n$).\n-   The reasoning contains a fundamental error: a mirror plane ($\\sigma$) is an *improper* symmetry operation ($S_1$), not a proper one. The consequence of this relationship is enantiotopicity, not homotopicity.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous application of stereochemical and symmetry principles, Option A provides the only fully accurate description of the situation.",
