            "problem": "A chemist is performing Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) on an organic molecule suspected to exhibit a five-bond hydrogen–carbon connectivity mediated by a W-coupling pathway. The HMBC transfer relies on heteronuclear scalar coupling evolution between a proton spin, denoted by the spin operator $\\mathbf{I}$, and a carbon spin, denoted by the spin operator $\\mathbf{S}$, under the scalar coupling Hamiltonian. The targeted pathway is a long-range five-bond coupling with magnitude $^5J_{\\mathrm{CH}}=1.5$ Hz. The evolution delay $\\Delta$ in HMBC is chosen to maximize the build-up of antiphase magnetization that transfers coherence between $\\mathbf{I}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$, enabling cross-peak observation for weak long-range couplings.\n\nStarting from fundamental spin Hamiltonian-based evolution for heteronuclear two-spin systems and the standard product-operator framework, derive the delay $\\Delta$ that maximizes the HMBC long-range transfer for a single heteronuclear coupling of magnitude $J$, and then evaluate it for $J=1.5$ Hz. Express your final numerical answer for the delay in milliseconds. Round your answer to three significant figures.\n\nAdditionally, discuss the trade-off introduced by finite transverse relaxation time $T_{2}$ (transverse relaxation time in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), including how $T_2$ enters into the signal evolution during long delays and how the optimal delay is altered when relaxation is not negligible. Your discussion should be qualitative but grounded in the same fundamental framework; do not introduce extraneous empirical “rules of thumb.”",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the optimal evolution delay, $\\Delta$, in a Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) experiment, tailored for a specific long-range heteronuclear coupling, $J$. The derivation will be performed within the product-operator formalism of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We will first consider an idealized system free of relaxation, then calculate the delay for the given coupling constant, and finally discuss the qualitative effect of including transverse relaxation.\n\nThe core of the HMBC experiment involves the evolution of proton spin coherence under the influence of the heteronuclear scalar coupling Hamiltonian. For a two-spin system consisting of a proton (spin $\\mathbf{I}$) and a carbon nucleus (spin $\\mathbf{S}$), the relevant part of the Hamiltonian during the delay $\\Delta$ is the scalar coupling term:\n$$H_J = 2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{IS}} I_z S_z$$\nwhere $J_{\\mathrm{IS}}$ is the scalar coupling constant in Hertz, and $I_z$ and $S_z$ are the Cartesian spin operators for the z-component of the spin angular momentum for spin I and S, respectively. For this problem, $J_{\\mathrm{IS}}$ corresponds to $^5J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$.\n\nIn the HMBC pulse sequence, after the initial $90^{\\circ}$ pulse on the protons and a subsequent evolution period, we have transverse proton magnetization. Let us consider a component of this magnetization represented by the operator $I_x$. The goal of the delay period $\\Delta$ is to convert this in-phase coherence ($I_x$) into antiphase coherence with respect to the carbon spin ($2I_y S_z$). This antiphase term is the necessary precursor for coherence transfer to the S spin, which ultimately generates the cross-peak in the 2D spectrum.\n\nThe evolution of the spin system under the Hamiltonian $H_J$ over the time $\\Delta$ is described by the transformation:\n$$\\sigma(\\Delta) = \\exp(-i H_J \\Delta) \\sigma(0) \\exp(i H_J \\Delta)$$\nwhere $\\sigma(0)$ is the density operator at the beginning of the delay, which we take to be proportional to $I_x$.\nSubstituting $H_J$ and $\\sigma(0) = I_x$, the evolution is:\n$$I_x \\xrightarrow{2\\pi J I_z S_z \\Delta} \\exp(-i 2\\pi J I_z S_z \\Delta) I_x \\exp(i 2\\pi J I_z S_z \\Delta)$$\nUsing the standard rotation rules for product operators, a rotation of $I_x$ about the $z$-axis of both spins (as dictated by $I_z S_z$) results in:\n$$I_x \\xrightarrow{2\\pi J I_z S_z \\Delta} I_x \\cos(\\pi J \\Delta) + 2 I_y S_z \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)$$\nHere, we use the simplified notation $J$ for $J_{\\mathrm{IS}}$. The term $2 I_y S_z$ represents the desired antiphase magnetization. The efficiency of its creation is governed by the function $\\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)$. To maximize the transfer, we must maximize the magnitude of this term. This occurs when $|\\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)|$ is maximal, i.e., equal to $1$.\n$$|\\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)| = 1$$\nThis condition is met when the argument of the sine function is an odd integer multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$$\\pi J \\Delta = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2} \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nSolving for $\\Delta$, we get:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{2n+1}{2J}$$\nThe shortest, most practical delay corresponds to $n=0$, which yields the optimal delay $\\Delta_{opt}$ in the absence of relaxation:\n$$\\Delta_{opt} = \\frac{1}{2J}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this delay for the given five-bond coupling constant, $^5J_{\\mathrm{CH}} = J = 1.5$ Hz.\n$$\\Delta_{opt} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.5} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ s} \\approx 0.3333... \\text{ s}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in milliseconds.\n$$\\Delta_{opt} = \\frac{1}{3}\\text{ s} \\times 1000\\frac{\\text{ms}}{\\text{s}} = 333.33... \\text{ ms}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $333$ ms.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a discussion of the effect of finite transverse relaxation time, $T_2$. In a real system, the transverse magnetization component, represented by operators $I_x$ and $I_y$, and product operators containing them, decays during the evolution period $\\Delta$. This decay is typically exponential and is characterized by the transverse relaxation time, $T_{2}$. The evolution of the $I_x$ operator now includes a decay term, $\\exp(-\\Delta/T_{2,I})$, where $T_{2,I}$ is the transverse relaxation time of the proton.\n\nThe full evolution of the initially created $I_x$ coherence, including both scalar coupling and relaxation, is:\n$$I_x \\xrightarrow{2\\pi J I_z S_z \\Delta, \\text{ Relaxation}} \\left[ I_x \\cos(\\pi J \\Delta) + 2 I_y S_z \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta) \\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{T_{2,I}}\\right)$$\nThe amplitude of the desired antiphase term, $2I_y S_z$, is now proportional to a function $A(\\Delta)$:\n$$A(\\Delta) = \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{T_{2,I}}\\right)$$\nThe optimal delay is the value of $\\Delta$ that maximizes this function $A(\\Delta)$. This is a trade-off: the $\\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)$ term builds up with increasing $\\Delta$, reaching its maximum at $\\Delta = 1/(2J)$, while the $\\exp(-\\Delta/T_{2,I})$ term continuously decreases, penalizing long delays.\n\nTo find the maximum, we set the derivative of $A(\\Delta)$ with respect to $\\Delta$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{dA}{d\\Delta} = \\frac{d}{d\\Delta}\\left[ \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{T_{2,I}}\\right) \\right] = 0$$\nApplying the product rule for differentiation:\n$$\\left[ \\pi J \\cos(\\pi J \\Delta) \\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{T_{2,I}}\\right) + \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta) \\left[ -\\frac{1}{T_{2,I}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{T_{2,I}}\\right) \\right] = 0$$\nFactoring out the non-zero exponential term:\n$$\\pi J \\cos(\\pi J \\Delta) - \\frac{1}{T_{2,I}} \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta) = 0$$\n$$\\pi J \\cos(\\pi J \\Delta) = \\frac{1}{T_{2,I}} \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)$$\nThis leads to the condition for the optimal delay, $\\Delta'_{opt}$, when relaxation is considered:\n$$\\tan(\\pi J \\Delta'_{opt}) = \\pi J T_{2,I}$$\nIn the limit of no relaxation ($T_{2,I} \\to \\infty$), the argument of the tangent function must approach $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which recovers the ideal case $\\Delta'_{opt} \\to 1/(2J)$. For any finite $T_{2,I}$, the term $\\pi J T_{2,I}$ is finite. Since $\\arctan(x)  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for any finite $x > 0$, the argument of the tangent function will be less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $\\pi J \\Delta'_{opt}  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which implies that $\\Delta'_{opt}  \\frac{1}{2J}$.\n\nIn summary, the presence of transverse relaxation necessitates a compromise. To maximize the observable signal, the evolution delay $\\Delta$ must be shortened relative to the ideal value of $1/(2J)$. This shorter delay reduces the maximal conversion efficiency into antiphase magnetization (the $\\sin$ term is less than $1$) but gains signal by mitigating the exponential decay due to relaxation. The shorter the $T_2$ time (i.e., the faster the relaxation), the more pronounced this effect is, and the shorter the optimal delay becomes. This trade-off is particularly critical for observing small, long-range couplings like the one in this problem, as the required ideal delay of $\\Delta = 1/(2J)$ can be very long, leading to substantial signal loss if relaxation is significant.",

            "problem": "In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of organic molecules, scalar spin-spin coupling is transmitted through bonding electrons and can be described by a spin Hamiltonian containing terms of the form $2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{XY}} \\mathbf{I}_{\\mathrm{X}} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{Y}}$, where $J_{\\mathrm{XY}}$ is the scalar coupling constant between nuclei $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ separated by $n$ bonds.

The detected cross-peak amplitude is a function of the chosen evolution delay and the magnitude of $J$, so cross-peaks due to different $n$-bond pathways can coexist if their $J$ values fall within the sensitivity window. In conjugated systems, $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ and even $^{5}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ can be appreciable in a “W” geometry, while $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ across heteroatoms (e.g., $\\mathrm{H}$ on $\\mathrm{N}$ or $\\mathrm{O}$ to an adjacent carbon) can also be observed.\n\nConsider an advanced structural assignment for a substituted cinnamamide: an $\\mathrm{Ar}$–$\\mathrm{CH}=\\mathrm{CH}$–$\\mathrm{C}(=\\mathrm{O})\\mathrm{NH}\\mathrm{R}$ framework bearing a para-methoxy group on the aromatic ring. An HMBC optimized at $J_{\\mathrm{opt}} = 8$ Hz shows the following cross-peaks: an aromatic $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{meta}}$ near $\\delta_{\\mathrm{H}}$ 7.10 ppm correlates to the amide carbonyl carbon at $\\delta_{\\mathrm{C}}$ 166 ppm; the vinylic $\\mathrm{H}_{\\beta}$ near $\\delta_{\\mathrm{H}}$ 6.70 ppm also correlates to the amide carbonyl carbon; and the $\\mathrm{NH}$ proton near $\\delta_{\\mathrm{H}}$ 8.60 ppm correlates to both the amide carbonyl carbon and the aromatic ipso carbon. A common pitfall is to misassign the $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{meta}} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ correlation as a $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ across a heteroatom and to misinterpret the $\\mathrm{NH} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ correlation as a long-range $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$.\n\nFrom first principles and well-tested facts of scalar coupling transmission and HMBC signal formation, choose the option that correctly identifies the misassignment risk where $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ peaks are confused with $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ across heteroatoms, and that provides structurally grounded checks to avoid such errors.\n\nA. The $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{meta}} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ correlation in an $\\mathrm{Ar}$–$\\mathrm{CH}=\\mathrm{CH}$–$\\mathrm{C}(=\\mathrm{O})\\mathrm{NH}\\mathrm{R}$ system is plausibly a $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ “W” coupling through the conjugated $\\mathrm{Ar}$–$\\mathrm{CH}=\\mathrm{CH}$–$\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ path rather than a $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ across a heteroatom, because the proton resides on carbon and no $\\mathrm{H}$–$\\mathrm{X}$–$\\mathrm{C}$ two-bond pathway exists. To check, vary the HMBC delay to compare cross-peak amplitudes at $J_{\\mathrm{opt}} = 5$ Hz versus $J_{\\mathrm{opt}} = 10$ Hz: $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ in “W” geometry is typically $\\approx 0.5$–$3$ Hz and should be favored at smaller $J_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, whereas $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ across $\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{O}$ is often $\\approx 2$–$10$ Hz and may be stronger at larger $J_{\\mathrm{opt}}$. Acquire Proton-detected Two-Bond Correlation (H2BC), which selectively detects $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ and should not show the $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{meta}} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ cross-peak if it is $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$. Perform $\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ exchange to remove the $\\mathrm{NH}$ proton: if the contentious cross-peak persists after exchange, it cannot be $\\mathrm{NH}$-mediated $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ and supports a $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ assignment.\n\nB. Any HMBC cross-peak involving an $\\mathrm{NH}$ proton and a carbonyl carbon must be a $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ across nitrogen by default because long-range $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ to a carbonyl is negligible. Therefore, one should assign such cross-peaks as $^{2}J$ without additional experiments; varying the HMBC delay cannot alter this conclusion.\n\nC. Allylic and vinylic “W” geometries routinely produce $^{5}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ cross-peaks of magnitude $\\geq 5$ Hz in HMBC, so the presence of a strong cross-peak from $\\mathrm{H}_{\\beta}$ to $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ necessarily indicates a short two-bond path. A reliable structural check is to infer dihedral angles from Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) intensities: strong NOEs imply small dihedral angles and hence a two-bond $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ pathway.\n\nD. Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) reveals the number of bonds in a coupling: if an HMBC cross-peak is absent in HSQC, it must be exactly two bonds ($^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$). Therefore, use HSQC presence or absence to classify the cross-peak and decide that the observed $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{meta}} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ correlation is a $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$ across a heteroatom; long-range $^{4}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ is excluded by HSQC non-observation.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of strategies to resolve a common ambiguity in HMBC spectra: distinguishing a true long-range coupling through a carbon skeleton from a two-bond coupling across a heteroatom. The case study is a cinnamamide, where a correlation between a meta-proton ($\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{meta}}$) and a carbonyl carbon ($\\mathrm{C=O}$) is observed.\n\nFirst, we analyze the structure `p-MeO-Ar–CH=CH–C(=O)NHR`. The coupling pathway from $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{meta}}$ to the carbonyl carbon is `H–C(meta)–C(ortho)–C(ipso)–C(α)=C(β)–C(=O)`. This is a five-bond pathway, so the correlation is due to a $^{5}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ coupling, a type of long-range coupling. There is no two-bond pathway involving a heteroatom between this specific proton and carbon. The challenge arises in *de novo* structure elucidation where alternative structures might be considered. The question asks for the best methods to confirm the assignment.\n\n**Option A: Correct.** This option correctly identifies the correlation as a long-range coupling through the conjugated system, as no two-bond pathway exists. It proposes three valid, state-of-the-art experimental checks:\n1.  **Varying HMBC delay:** The intensity of an HMBC cross-peak is maximized when the evolution delay is optimized for the specific $J$-coupling value. Small long-range couplings (like $^{4}J$ or $^{5}J$, typically $0.5-3$ Hz) are best observed at long delays (small $J_{\\mathrm{opt}}$), whereas larger two-bond couplings (typically $2-10$ Hz) are stronger at shorter delays (larger $J_{\\mathrm{opt}}$). Comparing spectra with different delays is a robust method to differentiate these.\n2.  **H2BC experiment:** The H2BC (or similar 2J,3J-selective) pulse sequence is designed to show only two- and sometimes three-bond correlations. A true long-range $^{5}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ coupling would be absent, providing definitive proof.\n3.  **$\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ exchange:** This is a classic experiment to identify protons attached to heteroatoms (N, O). If the correlation persisted after exchange, it would rule out the possibility that the proton signal belonged to an exchangeable proton in an alternative isomeric structure.\nAll proposed checks are scientifically sound and directly address the ambiguity.\n\n**Option B: Incorrect.** This option is dogmatic and factually wrong. It falsely claims that long-range couplings to carbonyls are negligible and that experimental parameters (like the HMBC delay) cannot help in the assignment. This contradicts fundamental NMR principles.\n\n**Option C: Incorrect.** This option contains two major errors. First, it wildly overestimates the magnitude of $^{5}J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ couplings, stating they can be $\\geq 5$ Hz; they are typically much smaller ($ 2$ Hz). Second, it confuses the roles of NOE and $J$-coupling. NOE measures through-space distance and provides conformational information, but it cannot prove a through-bond connectivity pathway like a $^{2}J_{\\mathrm{HC}}$.\n\n**Option D: Incorrect.** This option completely misinterprets the HSQC experiment. HSQC spectra show correlations only for one-bond ($^{1}J$) couplings. The absence of a cross-peak in HSQC merely proves the coupling is *not* one-bond; it could be two, three, four, or more bonds. The option's logic would lead to the misassignment of all long-range couplings as two-bond couplings.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only one that provides a correct analysis and a valid set of experimental verification strategies.",

Bayesian Model Formulation\n\nThe core of the problem is to infer a dihedral angle, denoted by the parameter $\\phi$, from a set of measured long-range NMR scalar couplings, $\\mathbf{J}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\{J_1^{\\mathrm{meas}}, J_2^{\\mathrm{meas}}, \\ldots, J_N^{\\mathrm{meas}}\\}$.

This reflects a state of maximal ignorance about $\\phi$ before observing the data. For a continuous variable, this is written as $\\pi(\\phi) = \\mathcal{U}(0^\\circ, 360^\\circ)$.\n\n**Likelihood Function:** The predicted coupling for each pathway $i$ is given by a Karplus-type relationship, modeled as a truncated cosine series:\n$$\nJ_i(\\phi) = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i \\cos(\\phi_{\\mathrm{rad}}) + \\gamma_i \\cos(2\\phi_{\\mathrm{rad}})\n$$\nwhere $\\phi_{\\mathrm{rad}}$ is the dihedral angle in radians, and $\\{\\alpha_i, \\beta_i, \\gamma_i\\}$ are known empirical coefficients for that pathway.\n\nThe measurement errors for each pathway are assumed to be independent and follow a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, the likelihood of measuring a specific value $J_i^{\\mathrm{meas}}$ for pathway $i$, given a true angle $\\phi$, is:\n$$\np(J_i^{\\mathrm{meas}} \\mid \\phi) = \\mathcal{N}(J_i^{\\mathrm{meas}} \\mid J_i(\\phi), \\sigma_i^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_i \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{J_i^{\\mathrm{meas}} - J_i(\\phi)}{\\sigma_i}\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_i$ is the known standard deviation of the measurement for pathway $i$.\n\nSince the measurements are independent across pathways, the total likelihood is the product of the individual likelihoods:\n$$\np(\\mathbf{J}^{\\mathrm{meas}} \\mid \\phi) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} p(J_i^{\\mathrm{meas}} \\mid \\phi)\n$$\n\n**Posterior Distribution:** Combining the uniform prior and the Gaussian likelihood, the posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood:\n$$\n\\pi(\\phi \\mid \\mathbf{J}^{\\mathrm{meas}}) \\propto \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{J_i^{\\mathrm{meas}} - J_i(\\phi)}{\\sigma_i}\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\nFor numerical stability, it is advantageous to work with the log-posterior. The log-posterior, up to an additive constant, is:\n$$\n\\log[\\pi(\\phi \\mid \\mathbf{J}^{\\mathrm{meas}})] \\propto -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{J_i^{\\mathrm{meas}} - J_i(\\phi)}{\\sigma_i}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe expression being summed is the chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) statistic for the goodness of fit. Maximizing the posterior is equivalent to minimizing $\\chi^2$.\n\n### 2. Numerical Implementation\n\nThe posterior distribution is computed on a discrete grid of $\\phi$ values from $0^{\\circ}$ to $359.9^{\\circ}$ with a step size of $\\Delta\\phi = 0.1^{\\circ}$. Let the grid points be $\\{\\phi_k\\}$.\n\nFor each grid point $\\phi_k$:\n1.  Convert $\\phi_k$ from degrees to radians.\n2.  For each pathway $i$, calculate the predicted coupling $J_i(\\phi_k)$.\n3.  Calculate the unnormalized log-posterior value $L_k = \\log[\\pi(\\phi_k \\mid \\mathbf{J}^{\\mathrm{meas}})]$.\n4.  To prevent numerical underflow when exponentiating, the log-posterior is shifted by its maximum value: $L_k' = L_k - \\max_j(L_j)$.\n5.  The unnormalized posterior probability at each grid point is $P_k' = \\exp(L_k')$.\n6.  The final normalized posterior probability mass function (PMF) is obtained by ensuring the sum over all grid points is unity: $P_k = P_k' / \\sum_j P_j'$.\n\n### 3. Calculation of Posterior Statistics\n\nFrom the computed posterior PMF $\\{P_k\\}$, we derive the required statistical estimates.\n\n**Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) Estimate:** The MAP estimate, $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}$, is the value of $\\phi$ that maximizes the posterior probability. On our discrete grid, this corresponds to the grid point $\\phi_k$ with the highest probability $P_k$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}} = \\phi_{\\arg\\max_k P_k}\n$$\n\n**Circular Mean:** The mean of a circular quantity like an angle is calculated by averaging the Cartesian components of vectors representing each angle, weighted by their probabilities. For each grid point $\\phi_k$ with probability $P_k$, the vector is $(\\cos(\\phi_k), \\sin(\\phi_k))$. The mean resultant vector components are:\n$$\nC = \\sum_k P_k \\cos(\\phi_{k, \\mathrm{rad}}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S = \\sum_k P_k \\sin(\\phi_{k, \\mathrm{rad}})\n$$\nThe mean angle, $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{mean}}$, is the angle of this resultant vector:\n$$\n\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\mathrm{atan2}(S, C)\n$$\nThe result from `atan2` (in radians) is converted to degrees and mapped to the interval $[0^{\\circ}, 360^{\\circ})$.\n\n**95% Credible Interval:** The problem requires an equal-tailed $95\\%$ credible interval constructed by \"linearizing\" the angle domain around the MAP estimate to handle wrap-around issues. This is implemented as follows:\n1.  Identify the MAP estimate $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}$.\n2.  Transform the circular angle grid $\\phi_k \\in [0^{\\circ}, 360^{\\circ})$ into a linear grid centered at $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}$. This is done by mapping the domain to $[\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}} - 180^{\\circ}, \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}} + 180^{\\circ})$. Any angle $\\phi_k$ is transformed to $\\phi_{k, \\mathrm{lin}} = ((\\phi_k - \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}} + 180^{\\circ}) \\pmod{360^{\\circ}}) - 180^{\\circ}$.\n3.  Sort the pairs of $(\\phi_{k, \\mathrm{lin}}, P_k)$ according to the linearized angle $\\phi_{k, \\mathrm{lin}}$.\n4.  Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) on this sorted, linearized domain.\n5.  Using linear interpolation on the CDF, find the linearized angles $\\phi_{\\mathrm{lin}, 0.025}$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{lin}, 0.975}$ corresponding to the $2.5$ and $97.5$ percentiles.\n6.  Transform these interval boundaries back to the original circular domain $[0^{\\circ}, 360^{\\circ})$:\n   $$\n   \\phi_{0.025} = (\\phi_{\\mathrm{lin}, 0.025} + \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}) \\pmod{360^{\\circ}}\n   $$\n   $$\n   \\phi_{0.975} = (\\phi_{\\mathrm{lin}, 0.975} + \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}) \\pmod{360^{\\circ}}\n   $$\nThis procedure correctly constructs the interval even when it crosses the $0^{\\circ}/360^{\\circ}$ boundary.\n\nFinally, all calculated angle values ($\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}$, $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{mean}}$, $\\phi_{0.025}$, $\\phi_{0.975}$) are rounded to one decimal place for the final output.",
