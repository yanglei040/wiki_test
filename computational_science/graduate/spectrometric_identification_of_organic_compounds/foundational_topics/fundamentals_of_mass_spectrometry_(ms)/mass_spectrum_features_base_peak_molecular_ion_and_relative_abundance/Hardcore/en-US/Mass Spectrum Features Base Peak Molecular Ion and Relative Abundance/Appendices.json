The result is mathematically derivable and verifiable from the provided data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first identifying the base peak, which is defined as the peak with the highest intensity in the mass spectrum. The given intensities are:\n- Intensity at $m/z = 43$: $I_{43} = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}$ counts\n- Intensity at $m/z = 57$: $I_{57} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}$ counts\n- Intensity at $m/z = 72$: $I_{72} = 6.0 \\times 10^{5}$ counts\n- Intensity at $m/z = 86$: $I_{86} = 3.0 \\times 10^{5}$ counts\n\nTo identify the base peak, we compare these intensity values:\n$$1.0 \\times 10^{6} > 6.0 \\times 10^{5} > 3.0 \\times 10^{5} > 2.5 \\times 10^{5}$$\nThe maximum intensity is $1.0 \\times 10^{6}$ counts, which corresponds to the peak at $m/z = 57$. Therefore, the peak at $m/z = 57$ is the base peak. The intensity of the base peak is denoted as $I_{\\text{base}}$.\n$$I_{\\text{base}} = I_{57} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ counts}$$\nThe problem requires the construction of a normalized relative abundance scale where the base peak has a normalized intensity of $1$. The relative abundance (or normalized intensity), $RA_{m/z}$, of any peak with mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ and absolute intensity $I_{m/z}$ is defined as the ratio of its intensity to the intensity of the base peak, $I_{\\text{base}}$. The assumption of linear detector response validates the use of this ratio.\n$$RA_{m/z} = \\frac{I_{m/z}}{I_{\\text{base}}}$$\nUsing this definition, the relative abundance of the base peak itself is:\n$$RA_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{base}}}{I_{\\text{base}}} = 1$$\nThis confirms the normalization scheme specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe task is to determine the normalized intensity (relative abundance) of the peak at $m/z = 72$. The intensity of this peak is given as $I_{72} = 6.0 \\times 10^{5}$ counts.\nWe apply the formula for relative abundance:\n$$RA_{72} = \\frac{I_{72}}{I_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{5}}{1.0 \\times 10^{6}}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$RA_{72} = 0.6$$\nThe problem explicitly requires the final answer to be expressed as a pure number rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.6$. To express this with four significant figures, we append trailing zeros.\n$$RA_{72} = 0.6000$$\nThis is the normalized intensity of the $m/z=72$ peak, as requested.",

Report only the estimated integer value of $C$; no units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem is to determine the number of carbon atoms, $C$, in an unknown hydrocarbon with molecular formula $\\text{C}_C\\text{H}_H$, given its monoisotopic mass and the relative intensity of its $M+1$ mass spectrometry peak.\n\n**Step 1: Problem Validation**\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard analytical chemistry problem based on the principles of mass spectrometry. All necessary data, including isotopic abundances ($p_C=0.0110$, $p_H=0.00015$), monoisotopic masses ($^{12}\\text{C}=12$, $^{1}\\text{H}=1$), the molecular mass ($142$), and the isotopic peak ratio ($I_{M+1}/I_{M}=0.110$), are provided. The assumptions, such as the first-order approximation, are clearly stated and appropriate for this context. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution may be pursued.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Constraints**\n\nTwo primary constraints are provided: the total mass of the molecule and the isotopic abundance ratio.\n\nFirst, we use the mass constraint. The molecule is a hydrocarbon, $\\text{C}_C\\text{H}_H$. The molecular ion $\\text{M}^+$ is observed at $m/z=142$. Assuming a single charge, the mass of the neutral molecule composed of the most abundant isotopes ($^{12}\\text{C}$ and $^{1}\\text{H}$) is $142$ unified atomic mass units. Using the provided integer monoisotopic masses, we can write the mass equation:\n$$12C + H = 142$$\nThis equation relates the number of carbon atoms, $C$, to the number of hydrogen atoms, $H$. We can express $H$ as a function of $C$:\n$$H = 142 - 12C$$\nSince both $C$ and $H$ must be non-negative integers, we have two conditions on $C$:\n$1$. $C \\ge 1$ (as it is a hydrocarbon).\n$2$. $H \\ge 0 \\implies 142 - 12C \\ge 0 \\implies 12C \\le 142 \\implies C \\le \\frac{142}{12} \\approx 11.83$.\nThus, $C$ must be an integer between $1$ and $11$.\n\nFurthermore, for a stable hydrocarbon with $C$ carbon atoms, the maximum number of hydrogen atoms is given by the formula for an acyclic alkane, $H \\le 2C + 2$. Applying this chemical stability constraint:\n$$142 - 12C \\le 2C + 2$$\n$$140 \\le 14C$$\n$$10 \\le C$$\nCombining the upper and lower bounds for $C$, we find that $10 \\le C \\le 11$. Therefore, the unknown hydrocarbon must have either $10$ or $11$ carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Isotopic Ratio Expression**\n\nThe second constraint is the ratio of the intensity of the $M+1$ peak to the $M$ peak, $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$. The $M$ peak arises from molecules containing only the most abundant isotopes, $^{12}\\text{C}$ and $^{1}\\text{H}$. The $M+1$ peak arises from molecules containing one heavier isotope, which in this case can be either one $^{13}\\text{C}$ atom or one $^{2}\\text{H}$ (deuterium) atom.\n\nThe first-order approximation states that the probability of having more than one isotopic substitution in a single molecule is negligible. Under this model, the relative intensity of the $M+1$ peak is the sum of the probabilities of a single substitution occurring at any possible site.\nFor a molecule $\\text{C}_C\\text{H}_H$, there are $C$ carbon atoms and $H$ hydrogen atoms. The probability of a single carbon atom being $^{13}\\text{C}$ is given by its natural abundance, $p_C = 0.0110$. The probability of a single hydrogen atom being $^{2}\\text{H}$ is $p_H = 0.00015$.\n\nThe contribution to the $M+1$ peak from $^{13}\\text{C}$ is proportional to the number of carbon atoms multiplied by the abundance of $^{13}\\text{C}$. Similarly, the contribution from $^{2}\\text{H}$ is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms multiplied by the abundance of $^{2}\\text{H}$. The resulting expression for the ratio of peak intensities is:\n$$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_M} \\approx C \\cdot p_C + H \\cdot p_H $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of C**\n\nWe now substitute the expression for $H$ from the mass constraint ($H=142-12C$) and the given numerical values into the isotopic ratio equation:\n$$0.110 = C \\cdot (0.0110) + (142 - 12C) \\cdot (0.00015)$$\nLet's solve this equation for $C$:\n$$0.110 = 0.0110C + 142 \\cdot (0.00015) - 12C \\cdot (0.00015)$$\n$$0.110 = 0.0110C + 0.0213 - 0.0018C$$\nCombine the terms containing $C$:\n$$0.110 - 0.0213 = (0.0110 - 0.0018)C$$\n$$0.0887 = 0.0092C$$\n$$C = \\frac{0.0887}{0.0092} \\approx 9.6413$$\nThis non-integer value of $C$ represents the theoretical value that would perfectly satisfy the given data under the model. The problem asks for the best integer estimate. The calculated value $C \\approx 9.64$ is much closer to $10$ than to $9$.\n\n**Step 5: Verification and Final Determination**\n\nFrom our earlier analysis of chemical and physical constraints, we determined that the only possible integer values for $C$ are $10$ and $11$. Our calculated value of $C \\approx 9.64$ strongly suggests that $C=10$ is the correct answer, with the discrepancy attributable to measurement error in the intensity ratio and the approximations in the model.\n\nTo confirm this, we can calculate the theoretical $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ ratio for both possibilities, $C=10$ and $C=11$, and see which is closer to the experimental value of $0.110$.\n\nCase 1: $C=10$\nIf $C=10$, then $H = 142 - 12(10) = 22$. The molecular formula is $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{22}$.\nThe predicted ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_M} = 10 \\cdot (0.0110) + 22 \\cdot (0.00015) = 0.110 + 0.0033 = 0.1133 $$\nThe absolute difference from the experimental value is $|0.1133 - 0.110| = 0.0033$.\n\nCase 2: $C=11$\nIf $C=11$, then $H = 142 - 12(11) = 10$. The molecular formula is $\\text{C}_{11}\\text{H}_{10}$.\nThe predicted ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_M} = 11 \\cdot (0.0110) + 10 \\cdot (0.00015) = 0.121 + 0.0015 = 0.1225 $$\nThe absolute difference from the experimental value is $|0.1225 - 0.110| = 0.0125$.\n\nThe calculated ratio for $C=10$ is significantly closer to the observed ratio than the one for $C=11$. Both the direct calculation of $C$ and the comparison of integer possibilities conclusively point to $C=10$ as the best integer estimate.\nThe molecular formula is $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{22}$, which corresponds to decane.",

The provided data and chemical principles are consistent with established knowledge in mass spectrometry.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying fundamental principles of mass spectrometry to the provided high-resolution mass data.\n\n1.  **Application of the Nitrogen Rule**:\n    The problem states that the unknown compound is an amine containing exactly one nitrogen atom. The nitrogen rule is a principle used to relate the nominal mass of a molecular ion to the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. For a molecule composed of C, H, N, O, S, and halogens, the rule states:\n    -   If the number of nitrogen atoms is even (including zero), the nominal molecular weight of the neutral molecule will be an even number.\n    -   If the number of nitrogen atoms is odd, the nominal molecular weight of the neutral molecule will be an odd number.\n\n    The molecular ion radical cation, $M^{+\\cdot}$, is formed by removing one electron from the neutral molecule $M$. The mass of an electron is negligible for calculating the nominal mass, so the nominal $m/z$ value of $M^{+\\cdot}$ (for a singly charged ion, $z=1$) will have the same parity as the nominal molecular weight of $M$.\n\n    Given that the compound has one nitrogen atom (an odd number), the nominal mass of its molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$ must be an odd integer. The two observed peaks are at $m/z$ values with nominal masses of $101$ and $102$.\n    -   Peak 1: $m/z = 101.0703$ (nominal mass $101$)\n    -   Peak 2: $m/z = 102.0780$ (nominal mass $102$)\n\n    Based on the nitrogen rule, only the peak with the odd nominal mass can be the molecular ion, $M^{+\\cdot}$. Therefore, the peak at $m/z = 101.0703$ must be the molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$.\n\n2.  **Identification of the Second Peak**:\n    Having identified $M^{+\\cdot}$ at $m/z=101.0703$, we must now identify the peak at $m/z=102.0780$. Let us calculate the precise mass difference between the two peaks:\n    $$ \\Delta m = 102.0780\\,\\mathrm{u} - 101.0703\\,\\mathrm{u} = 1.0077\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n    We now compare this observed mass difference to the theoretical mass differences for plausible species.\n\n    -   **$M+1$ Isotopic Peak**: An $M+1$ peak arises from the natural abundance of heavy isotopes.\n        -   The mass increment for substituting one $^{13}\\text{C}$ for a $^{12}\\text{C}$ is given as $\\approx 1.003355\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n        -   The mass increment for substituting one $^{15}\\text{N}$ for a $^{14}\\text{N}$ is given as $\\approx 0.997035\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n        The observed mass difference of $1.0077\\,\\mathrm{u}$ does not match either of these values. Therefore, the peak at $m/z=102.0780$ is not a simple $M+1$ isotopic peak of the species at $m/z=101.0703$.\n\n    -   **Protonated Molecular Ion $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$**: This species is formed by the addition of a proton ($H^+$) to the neutral molecule $M$. The mass of the molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$ is $m(M^{+\\cdot}) = m(M) - m(e^-)$. The mass of the protonated molecule is $m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+) = m(M) + m(p^+)$. The difference in mass between these two ions is:\n    $$ m([\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+) - m(M^{+\\cdot}) = (m(M) + m(p^+)) - (m(M) - m(e^-)) = m(p^+) + m(e^-) = m({}^1H) $$\n    This difference is the mass of a neutral hydrogen atom. Using the provided value for the mass of a proton ($m(p^+) \\approx 1.007276\\,\\mathrm{u}$) and the known mass of an electron ($m(e^-) \\approx 0.000549\\,\\mathrm{u}$), the mass of a hydrogen atom is:\n    $$ m({}^1H) = 1.007276\\,\\mathrm{u} + 0.000549\\,\\mathrm{u} = 1.007825\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\n    The observed mass difference is $\\Delta m = 1.0077\\,\\mathrm{u}$. The agreement between the observed difference ($1.0077\\,\\mathrm{u}$) and the theoretical mass difference for protonation ($1.007825\\,\\mathrm{u}$) is excellent. The small discrepancy of $0.000125\\,\\mathrm{u}$ is well within the typical tolerance for high-resolution mass spectrometry.\n\n    Therefore, the peak at $m/z=102.0780$ is the protonated adduct of the molecule, $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\n-   **A. $m/z=101.0703$ is the molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$; $m/z=102.0780$ is a protonated adduct $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$ rather than an $M+1$ isotope.**\n    This statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The nitrogen rule identifies $m/z=101.0703$ as $M^{+\\cdot}$. The mass difference calculation confirms that $m/z=102.0780$ is the protonated adduct $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$ and not an isotopic peak.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. $m/z=102.0780$ is the molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$; $m/z=101.0703$ is a fragment, with the $1.0077\\,\\mathrm{u}$ spacing indicating an $M+1$ $^{13}\\text{C}$ isotope.**\n    This statement is incorrect for several reasons. First, a peak with an even nominal mass ($102$) cannot be the molecular ion for a compound with one nitrogen atom. Second, the mass spacing of $1.0077\\,\\mathrm{u}$ is incorrectly attributed to a $^{13}\\text{C}$ isotope; the correct mass increment for $^{13}\\text{C}$ is $\\approx 1.003355\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. $m/z=101.0703$ is the molecular ion $M^{+\\cdot}$; $m/z=102.0780$ is the $M+1$ isotopic peak due to $^{13}\\text{C}$, and the nitrogen rule is not applicable to decide parity here.**\n    This statement is partially correct but ultimately flawed. While it correctly identifies $m/z=101.0703$ as $M^{+\\cdot}$, it incorrectly assigns $m/z=102.0780$ as a $^{13}\\text{C}$ isotopic peak, which is contradicted by the mass difference. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims the nitrogen rule is not applicable, when in fact it is the key principle for the initial identification.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. $m/z=102.0780$ is a protonated molecular ion $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$ of the amine, and there is no $M^{+\\cdot}$ peak in such spectra; the nitrogen rule cannot be used to identify $M^{+\\cdot}$ in this case.**\n    This statement contains multiple inaccuracies. While $m/z=102.0780$ is indeed likely $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$, the claim that \"there is no $M^{+\\cdot}$ peak in such spectra\" is an overgeneralization and is contradicted by the data, which shows a peak perfectly consistent with $M^{+\\cdot}$. The claim that the nitrogen rule cannot be used is false; it is the essential tool for identifying $M^{+\\cdot}$ from its mass parity.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
