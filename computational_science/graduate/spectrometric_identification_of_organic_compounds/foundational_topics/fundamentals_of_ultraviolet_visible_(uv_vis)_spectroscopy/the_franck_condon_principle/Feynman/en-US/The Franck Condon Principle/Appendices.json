            "solution": "The problem is first assessed for validity. All provided information is scientifically sound and self-consistent. The problem uses the standard harmonic oscillator model to describe vibrational modes in the context of the Franck-Condon principle, a cornerstone of molecular spectroscopy. The definition of the dimensionless normal coordinate $q$, the reorganization energy $\\lambda$, and the physical constants and relations are all standard and correct. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It is therefore deemed a valid scientific problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, a derivation of the reorganization energy $\\lambda$ from first principles, and second, its numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Reorganization Energy $\\lambda$**\n\nThe potential energy $V$ of a quantum harmonic oscillator with mass-weighted normal coordinate $Q$ and angular frequency $\\omega$ is given by $V(Q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 Q^2$. The problem defines a dimensionless normal coordinate $q = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\hbar}}Q$. We can express the potential energy in terms of this dimensionless coordinate. From the definition of $q$, we have $Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{\\omega}}q$. Substituting this into the potential energy expression gives:\n$$V(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{\\omega}}q \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{\\omega} \\right) q^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega q^2$$\nThis expression gives the potential energy as a function of the dimensionless coordinate $q$. The term $\\hbar\\omega$ is the energy of a single vibrational quantum for this mode.\n\nThe problem specifies two electronic states, ground ($g$) and excited ($e$), modeled by harmonic potentials of identical frequency $\\omega$ but with displaced minima.\nThe ground-state potential, $V_g$, has its minimum at $q=0$. Its functional form is:\n$$V_g(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega q^2$$\nThe excited-state potential, $V_e$, has its minimum at $q=\\Delta q$. Its functional form is:\n$$V_e(q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (q - \\Delta q)^2$$\nNote that any constant energy offset representing the electronic energy gap is irrelevant for the calculation of the reorganization energy, as $\\lambda$ is defined as an energy difference on the excited-state potential energy surface.\n\nThe reorganization energy, $\\lambda$, is defined as the energy released when the system, having undergone a vertical electronic transition to the excited state at the ground state's equilibrium geometry ($q=0$), relaxes to the equilibrium geometry of the excited state ($q=\\Delta q$). Mathematically, this is the difference in the excited state's potential energy between these two points:\n$$\\lambda = V_e(q=0) - V_e(q=\\Delta q)$$\n\nWe calculate the two terms:\nThe potential energy at the initial point of relaxation ($q=0$ on the excited-state surface) is:\n$$V_e(q=0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (0 - \\Delta q)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (\\Delta q)^2$$\nThe potential energy at the final, relaxed point ($q=\\Delta q$ on the excited-state surface) is:\n$$V_e(q=\\Delta q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (\\Delta q - \\Delta q)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (0)^2 = 0$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\lambda$ yields the derived formula:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (\\Delta q)^2 - 0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega (\\Delta q)^2$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $\\lambda$**\n\nThe problem provides the necessary values:\n- The spectroscopic wavenumber of the vibrational mode: $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n- The dimensionless displacement: $\\Delta q = 1.4$.\n\nThe energy of a vibrational quantum, $\\hbar\\omega$, is directly related to its spectroscopic wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ by the relation $E = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$. Therefore, the term $\\hbar\\omega$ in our derived expression for $\\lambda$ corresponds to the energy equivalent of the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nTo compute the reorganization energy as a wavenumber, denoted $\\tilde{\\lambda}$, we can adapt our derived formula. Since $\\lambda = E$, we have $\\lambda = hc\\tilde{\\lambda}$. Thus:\n$$hc\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}(hc\\tilde{\\nu})(\\Delta q)^2$$\nDividing by $hc$, we obtain the reorganization energy in units of wavenumber:\n$$\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{\\nu}(\\Delta q)^2$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}(1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})(1.4)^2 = (750\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})(1.96) = 1470\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. The exact result is $1470$. To explicitly indicate four significant figures, we write this as $1.470 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute the reorganization energy in units of electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$). We can use the provided conversion factor: $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 8065.544\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eV}} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\lambda}}{\\text{conversion factor}} = \\frac{1470\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{8065.544\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}/\\mathrm{eV}}$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 0.1822605\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 0.1823\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe final numerical results, in the requested order (first $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, then $\\mathrm{eV}$) and rounded to four significant figures, are $1.470 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $0.1823\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.",

The transition $I_{0\\to 0}$ corresponds to the process $(g, v''=0) \\to (e, v'=0)$, while the hot band $I_{1\\to 0}$ corresponds to the process $(g, v''=1) \\to (e, v'=0)$.\n\nWithin the Condon approximation, the integrated intensity of a vibronic transition $I_{v'' \\to v'}$ is proportional to the product of the population of the initial vibrational state, $N_{v''}$, and the Franck-Condon factor (FCF), which is the squared overlap integral of the vibrational wavefunctions, $|\\langle v' | v'' \\rangle|^2$.\n$$\nI_{v'' \\to v'} \\propto N_{v''} |\\langle \\psi_{v'} | \\psi_{v''} \\rangle|^2\n$$\nThe electronic transition dipole moment is assumed to be constant and thus cancels out in the ratio of intensities.\n\nThe desired ratio $R$ is therefore given by:\n$$\nR = \\frac{I_{1\\to 0}}{I_{0\\to 0}} = \\frac{N_{1} |\\langle \\psi_{v'=0} | \\psi_{v''=1} \\rangle|^2}{N_{0} |\\langle \\psi_{v'=0} | \\psi_{v''=0} \\rangle|^2} = \\left(\\frac{N_1}{N_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{|\\langle 0 | 1 \\rangle|^2}{|\\langle 0 | 0 \\rangle|^2}\\right)\n$$\nHere, we have simplified the notation for the overlap integrals. The derivation proceeds in two parts: first, determining the population ratio, and second, determining the ratio of the Franck-Condon factors.\n\nFirst, we determine the population ratio, $\\frac{N_1}{N_0}$. The system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, so the populations of the vibrational levels in the ground electronic state follow the Boltzmann distribution. The population $N_{v''}$ of a state with energy $E_{v''}$ is proportional to $\\exp(-E_{v''}/(k_B T))$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nUsing the harmonic oscillator model, the energy of the $v''$-th vibrational level is $E_{v''} = (v'' + 1/2)h c \\omega$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\omega$ is the vibrational wavenumber.\nThe energies of the ground ($v''=0$) and first excited ($v''=1$) vibrational states are:\n$$\nE_0 = \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) h c \\omega = \\frac{1}{2} h c \\omega\n$$\n$$\nE_1 = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) h c \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} h c \\omega\n$$\nThe population ratio is then:\n$$\n\\frac{N_1}{N_0} = \\frac{\\exp(-E_1 / (k_B T))}{\\exp(-E_0 / (k_B T))} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1 - E_0}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\omega}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the ratio of the Franck-Condon factors. The problem specifies a model of displaced harmonic oscillators with identical frequencies, for which the FCFs can be expressed in terms of the Huang-Rhys factor, $S$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, self-contained, and algorithmically tractable. It provides a clear and formalizable task based on established principles of molecular spectroscopy. All necessary parameters and constants are provided, and the requirements are unambiguous. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution requires the simulation of a fluorescence emission spectrum for a system of two conformers. This is achieved by applying the Franck-Condon principle within the displaced harmonic oscillator model. The total spectrum is the population-weighted sum of the spectra from each conformer, with each spectral line broadened by a Gaussian function to account for experimental and environmental effects.\n\nThe theoretical framework is as follows:\n\n1.  **Franck-Condon Principle and the Displaced Harmonic Oscillator Model**: According to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, electronic transitions are instantaneous on the timescale of nuclear motion. The intensity of a vibronic transition is proportional to the square of the overlap integral between the initial and final vibrational wavefunctions, known as the Franck-Condon factor (FCF). For an emission transition from the ground vibrational level ($v'=0$) of an excited electronic state to a vibrational level $v$ of the ground electronic state, the FCF is given by $FCF_v = |\\langle \\psi'_{v'=0} | \\psi''_{v''=v} \\rangle|^2$. In the displaced harmonic oscillator model, where the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces are harmonic parabolas with identical frequencies but displaced origins, this FCF is given by a Poisson distribution dependent on the Huang-Rhys factor $S$:\n    $$\n    FCF_v = \\frac{S^v e^{-S}}{v!}\n    $$\n    Here, $S$ is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the geometric displacement between the potential minima and thus the strength of the electron-phonon coupling. The sum of all FCFs is normalized to unity: $\\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} FCF_v = 1$.\n\n2.  **Vibronic Line Positions**: The energy of a photon emitted in a $v'=0 \\to v''=v$ transition is determined by the electronic energy gap of the zero-phonon line ($0-0$ transition), $E_{00}$, and the vibrational energy quantum, $\\hbar\\omega$:\n    $$\n    E_v = E_{00} - v \\hbar \\omega\n    $$\n    where $v = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the vibrational quantum number in the ground electronic state.\n\n3.  **Spectral Broadening**: Each discrete vibronic transition is broadened into a continuous line shape. The problem specifies a Gaussian function, $G(E; E_v, \\sigma)$, centered at the transition energy $E_v$ with a standard deviation $\\sigma$. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian is related to $\\sigma$ by:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{FWHM} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln{2}} \\cdot \\sigma\n    $$\n    The problem requires that the integrated area of each Gaussian line be equal to its relative intensity. Therefore, we use the normalized Gaussian probability density function, scaled by the appropriate intensity weight:\n    $$\n    G(E; E_v, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(E-E_v)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Total Spectrum Construction**: The total emission spectrum, $I_{\\text{total}}(E)$, is the incoherent sum of contributions from both conformers (indexed by $i=1, 2$), weighted by their respective population fractions, $p_i$. The spectrum for each conformer is a sum over all its vibronic transitions.\n    $$\n    I_{\\text{total}}(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} p_i \\left( \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} FCF_v^{(i)} \\cdot G\\left(E; E_v^{(i)}, \\sigma\\right) \\right)\n    $$\n    where $FCF_v^{(i)}$ and $E_v^{(i)}$ are calculated using the conformer-specific parameters $S_i$ and $E_{00}^{(i)}$.\n\n5.  **Energy-Wavelength Conversion**: The sampling points are given in wavelengths $\\lambda$ (in $\\mathrm{nm}$), which must be converted to energy $E$ (in $\\mathrm{eV}$) for the calculation:\n    $$\n    E \\, (\\mathrm{eV}) = \\frac{hc}{e\\lambda} = \\frac{1239.84197386209 \\, \\mathrm{eV \\cdot nm}}{\\lambda \\, (\\mathrm{nm})}\n    $$\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Define the fixed physical constant for energy-wavelength conversion, $hc/e = 1239.84197386209 \\, \\mathrm{eV \\cdot nm}$, and the fixed system parameters: $S_1 = 0.6$, $S_2 = 1.2$, $p_1 = 0.7$, and $p_2 = 0.3$.\n\n2.  **Truncation of Vibrational Series**: The infinite sum over $v$ is truncated at a sufficiently large value, $v_{max}$. The terms $FCF_v$ decay rapidly for $v > S$. For the maximum Huang-Rhys factor in this problem, $S=1.2$, the intensity progression diminishes substantially for $v > 5$. A conservative choice of $v_{max}=15$ ensures that the cumulative omitted intensity is negligible (less than $10^{-9}$).\n\n3.  **Iteration over Test Cases**: For each test case provided:\n    a.
