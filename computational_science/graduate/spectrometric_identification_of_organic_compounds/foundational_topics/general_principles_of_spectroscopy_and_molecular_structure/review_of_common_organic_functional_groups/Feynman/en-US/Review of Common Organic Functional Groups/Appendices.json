            "problem": "A neutral organic compound is analyzed by High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS, Electron Ionization (EI)) and Infrared Spectroscopy (IR). The EI molecular ion shows an exact mass of $m_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 164.04734$ Da. The isotopic pattern has relative intensities $I_{M+1}/I_{M} = 0.098 \\pm 0.003$ and $I_{M+2}/I_{M} = 0.004 \\pm 0.001$. The IR spectrum shows a single strong carbonyl absorption at $1735$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and no absorptions attributable to aldehydic $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$. Carbon-Hydrogen-Nitrogen (CHN) elemental analysis detects no nitrogen within the detection limit ($< 0.1$ by mass fraction). No chlorine or bromine isotopic pattern is observed. Assume the $M{+}1$ isotope intensity is dominated by ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, with natural abundance $0.0110$ per carbon, and use standard monoisotopic exact masses: ${}^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ $12.000000$ Da, ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ $1.007825032$ Da, ${}^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ $15.994914620$ Da, ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ $14.003074005$ Da.\n\nThree isobaric elemental compositions that include at least one carbonyl are proposed for the neutral molecule, each with nominal mass $164$: $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$, and $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the identification of the correct elemental composition for an unknown organic compound from a list of three candidates, based on provided mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy data. Subsequently, the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) for the selected composition must be calculated. The validation process begins by systematically evaluating each candidate formula against the experimental evidence.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Observed exact mass of the molecular ion: $m_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 164.04734$ Da.\n- Isotopic abundance ratios: $I_{M+1}/I_{M} = 0.098 \\pm 0.003$ and $I_{M+2}/I_{M} = 0.004 \\pm 0.001$.\n- IR absorptions: A strong peak at $1735$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (carbonyl) and no aldehydic $\\mathrm{C{-}H}$ stretch.\n- Elemental analysis: No nitrogen detected.\n- Isotopic masses: ${}^{12}\\mathrm{C} = 12.000000$ Da, ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H} = 1.007825032$ Da, ${}^{16}\\mathrm{O} = 15.994914620$ Da, ${}^{14}\\mathrm{N} = 14.003074005$ Da.\n- Natural abundance of ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$: $A(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) = 0.0110$ per carbon atom.\n\nThe three candidate compositions are $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$, and $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$.\n\nWe will evaluate each candidate.\n\n1.  **Evaluation of $\\mathrm{C}_{8}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$**\n    This composition contains two nitrogen atoms. The CHN elemental analysis explicitly states that no nitrogen was detected. Therefore, this candidate is inconsistent with the elemental analysis data and is rejected.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$**\n    This composition contains $c=10$ carbon atoms, $h=12$ hydrogen atoms, and $o=2$ oxygen atoms.\n    - **Isotope Ratio ($M+1$):** The number of carbon atoms, $N_C$, can be estimated from the $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ ratio: $N_C \\approx \\frac{I_{M+1}/I_{M}}{A(^{13}\\mathrm{C})}$. The observed ratio is in the range $[0.095, 0.101]$. Using the central value, $N_C \\approx \\frac{0.098}{0.0110} \\approx 8.9$. This suggests the molecule most likely contains $9$ carbon atoms. The formula $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ predicts an $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ ratio of $10 \\times 0.0110 = 0.110$.

This discrepancy is far too large for High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry, which typically has errors in the range of a few parts per million (ppm), corresponding to less than $0.001$ Da for a molecule of this mass.\n    Based on the disagreements with both the M+1 isotope ratio and the exact mass, the composition $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is rejected.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$**\n    This composition contains $c=9$ carbon atoms, $h=8$ hydrogen atoms, and $o=3$ oxygen atoms.\n    - **Elemental Analysis:** This composition contains no nitrogen, which is consistent with the CHN analysis.\n    - **Isotope Ratio ($M+1$):** The predicted $I_{M+1}/I_{M}$ ratio is $N_C \\times A(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) = 9 \\times 0.0110 = 0.099$. This value lies perfectly within the experimental range of $0.098 \\pm 0.003$ (i.e., $[0.095, 0.101]$).\n    - **Exact Mass:** The theoretical exact mass for $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ is calculated as:\n    $$m_{\\mathrm{calc}} = 9 \\times m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 8 \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + 3 \\times m(^{16}\\mathrm{O})$$\n    $$m_{\\mathrm{calc}} = 9 \\times 12.000000 + 8 \\times 1.007825032 + 3 \\times 15.994914620$$\n    $$m_{\\mathrm{calc}} = 108.000000 + 8.062600256 + 47.984743860 = 164.047344116~\\mathrm{Da}$$\n    The difference between the calculated and observed mass is $|\\Delta m| = |164.047344116 - 164.04734| = 0.000004116$ Da. This corresponds to a mass error of approximately $0.025$ ppm, which represents an excellent match and is fully consistent with the capabilities of HRMS.\n    - **Other Data:** The IR absorption at $1735 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ confirms the presence of a carbonyl group, which is possible with this formula. The provided $I_{M+2}/I_{M}$ ratio of $0.004 \\pm 0.001$ shows a discrepancy with the theoretical value of approximately $0.011$ for this formula. However, given the overwhelming and conclusive agreement from three independent and highly reliable pieces of data (CHN analysis, exact mass, and M+1 ratio), this minor discrepancy in the M+2 data point does not invalidate the conclusion.\n\nBased on the comprehensive evaluation, the elemental composition $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ is the only one consistent with the provided data.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) for this composition. The DBE, also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the total number of rings and $\\pi$ bonds in a molecule. The formula for a compound with the general formula $\\mathrm{C}_c\\mathrm{H}_h\\mathrm{N}_n\\mathrm{O}_o$ is:\n$$DBE = c - \\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + 1$$\nFor the composition $\\mathrm{C}_{9}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$, we have $c = 9$, $h = 8$, and $n = 0$. Substituting these values into the formula:\n$$DBE = 9 - \\frac{8}{2} + \\frac{0}{2} + 1$$\n$$DBE = 9 - 4 + 0 + 1$$\n$$DBE = 6$$\nA DBE of $6$ is chemically reasonable. For example, it could correspond to a molecule containing a benzene ring (DBE = $4$) and two additional $\\pi$ bonds, such as in a keto-acid structure or a substituted vinyl group attached to a carboxyl group.",

In spectrometric identification, these latter features strongly influence observables such as infrared carbonyl stretching frequency and nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift. For example, although all carboxylic acid derivatives above have the same formal oxidation state $+3$ at the carbonyl carbon, their infrared $\\nu_{\\mathrm{C{=}O}}$ frequencies differ because the effective C=O bond order varies with $\\pi$-donation ability of $Z$ (amide $Z=\\mathrm{NR_2}$ has strong $n\\rightarrow\\pi^\\ast$ donation, lowering the C=O frequency; acid halide $Z=\\mathrm{X}$ has poor $\\pi$ donation, raising it). Thus, spectroscopy differentiates among derivatives despite identical formal oxidation levels.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A states $\\mathrm{R{-}CH_2{-}OH} < \\mathrm{R{-}CHO} < \\mathrm{R{-}CO{-}R'} < \\mathrm{R{-}COZ}$ with $Z$ in $\\{\\mathrm{OH,\\,OR',\\,O{-}COR,\\,X,\\,NR_2}\\}$ all tied. This matches the computed sequence $-1 < +1 < +2 < +3$. Correct.\n- Option B orders the $+3$ derivatives by reactivity/polarity (acid halide highest, then anhydride, ester, acid, amide). This contradicts the formal oxidation state equality of all these at $+3$. Incorrect.\n- Option C places the aldehyde below the primary alcohol, implying $+1 < -1$, which is false by the computed values. Incorrect.\n- Option D places the ketone below the aldehyde, implying $+2 < +1$, which contradicts the computed values. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option A.",

The solvents have the following approximate properties on the Kamlet–Taft scale: $S_1$ is nonpolar and non-hydrogen-bonding with dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_r\\approx 2$ and hydrogen-bond donor ability $\\alpha\\approx 0$ and acceptor ability $\\beta\\approx 0$; $S_2$ is polar protic with $\\varepsilon_r\\approx 33$, $\\alpha\\approx 0.93$, $\\beta\\approx 0.62$; $S_3$ is polar aprotic with $\\varepsilon_r\\approx 47$, $\\alpha\\approx 0$, $\\beta\\approx 0.76$. The aryl ketone presents a carbonyl stretch $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ and a phenolic hydroxyl stretch $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ in IR, and a labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton resonance in $^1$H NMR.\n\nStarting from the harmonic oscillator model for vibrational modes, the fundamental vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is given by\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the bond force constant, $\\mu$ is the reduced mass, and $c$ is the speed of light. Hydrogen bonding that weakens a bond lowers $k$, which, through the square-root dependence above, lowers $\\tilde{\\nu}$ (a red-shift). Band broadening can arise from a distribution of local environments (inhomogeneous broadening) and dynamic exchange among hydrogen-bonded states.\n\nFor $^1$H NMR, the resonance condition is $\\omega = \\gamma B_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, where $B_{\\mathrm{eff}}=B_0(1-\\sigma)$ depends on the applied field $B_0$ and the electronic shielding $\\sigma$. A decrease in $\\sigma$ (deshielding) moves the chemical shift $\\delta$ downfield (to larger $\\delta$ in $\\mathrm{ppm}$). Fast chemical exchange at rate $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ among environments can broaden or average labile proton signals.\n\nWhich option best describes, relative to $S_1$, the combined effects of solvent polarity and hydrogen-bonding propensity on the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ and $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ IR bands and on the labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ $^1$H NMR chemical shift and line shape when the solute is in $S_2$ and $S_3$?\n\nA. In $S_2$ (high $\\alpha$), the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch red-shifts and gains intensity; the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts and markedly broadens. In $S_3$ (high $\\beta$, $\\alpha=0$), the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch shows only a small shift, whereas the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts but broadens less than in $S_2$. In $^1$H NMR, the labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton shifts downfield in both $S_2$ and $S_3$, with more pronounced line broadening in $S_2$ due to faster exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) within a protic hydrogen-bond network.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in applying the principles of physical organic chemistry to the interpretation of spectroscopic data. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All provided information is consistent with established chemical theory.\n\nThe problem asks to predict the spectroscopic changes for an aryl ketone with a phenolic hydroxyl group when moving from a nonpolar, non-hydrogen-bonding solvent ($S_1$, $n$-hexane) to a polar protic solvent ($S_2$, methanol) and a polar aprotic solvent ($S_3$, dimethyl sulfoxide). The key functional groups to consider are the carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C{=}O}$) and the phenolic hydroxyl ($\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$).\n\n**Reference State: Solvent $S_1$ ($n$-hexane)**\nIn $n$-hexane ($\\varepsilon_r \\approx 2$, $\\alpha \\approx 0$, $\\beta \\approx 0$), solvent-solute interactions are minimal, limited to weak, non-specific van der Waals forces. The IR and NMR spectra in this solvent serve as a baseline representing the \"free\" or nearly-free solute molecule, though some degree of intermolecular self-association between solute molecules (e.g., $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}\\cdots\\mathrm{O{=}C}$) might occur depending on concentration.\n\n**Analysis of Solvent Effects on IR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe fundamental vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is given by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$. A key principle is that hydrogen bonding to a group weakens its covalent bonds, which decreases the force constant $k$ and thus decreases $\\tilde{\\nu}$ (a red-shift).\n\n1.  **Carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C{=}O}$) Stretch:**\n    *   The carbonyl oxygen is a hydrogen-bond acceptor.\n    *   **In $S_2$ (methanol):** Methanol is a strong hydrogen-bond donor ($\\alpha \\approx 0.93$). It will form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen: $\\mathrm{C{=}O}\\cdots\\mathrm{H-O(CH_3)}$. This interaction draws electron density away from the carbonyl carbon and onto the oxygen, increasing the contribution of the single-bonded resonance structure $\\mathrm{C^{+}-O^{-}}$. This weakens the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ double bond, decreases the force constant $k$, and results in a significant **red-shift** (lower $\\tilde{\\nu}$) of the stretching frequency relative to $S_1$. The formation of this H-bond also increases the change in dipole moment during the vibration, which typically leads to an **increase in the intensity** of the absorption band.\n    *   **In $S_3$ (DMSO):** DMSO is not a hydrogen-bond donor ($\\alpha \\approx 0$). Therefore, it cannot form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen. The primary effect is the high polarity of the solvent ($\\varepsilon_r \\approx 47$), which can stabilize the charge-separated resonance form $\\mathrm{C^{+}-O^{-}}$ through dipole-dipole interactions. This effect also weakens the bond and causes a red-shift, but the magnitude of this general polarity effect is much smaller than that of a specific hydrogen bond. Thus, we expect a **small red-shift** relative to $S_1$, and a much smaller shift than in $S_2$.\n\n2.  **Phenolic Hydroxyl ($\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$) Stretch:**\n    *   The phenolic proton is a hydrogen-bond donor.\n    *   **In $S_2$ (methanol):** Methanol is a moderate hydrogen-bond acceptor ($\\beta \\approx 0.62$). The phenolic proton will donate a hydrogen bond to a methanol oxygen: $\\mathrm{Ar-O-H}\\cdots\\mathrm{O(H)CH_3}$. This interaction weakens the covalent $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ bond, lowers $k$, and causes a significant **red-shift**. Furthermore, in a protic solvent like methanol, the solute is part of a dynamic, three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network. The solute molecule rapidly exchanges between different hydrogen-bonded states. This distribution of local environments (inhomogeneous broadening) and rapid dynamic exchange leads to a **very broad** absorption band.\n    *   **In $S_3$ (DMSO):** DMSO is a very strong hydrogen-bond acceptor ($\\beta \\approx 0.76$). It will form a strong hydrogen bond with the phenolic proton: $\\mathrm{Ar-O-H}\\cdots\\mathrm{O{=}S(CH_3)_2}$. This strong interaction significantly weakens the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ bond, leading to a large **red-shift**, often even larger than in methanol. However, the nature of the broadening is different. DMSO is aprotic, so there is no extended network of exchangeable solvent protons. The solute primarily exists in a single, well-defined H-bonded state with the solvent. This more uniform environment results in an absorption band that is still broad compared to the \"free\" $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ in $S_1$, but is characteristically **much sharper than in protic solvents** like $S_2$.\n\n**Analysis of Solvent Effects on $^1$H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe chemical shift $\\delta$ is determined by the local electronic shielding $\\sigma$. Hydrogen bonding pulls electron density away from the bonded proton, reducing its shielding (deshielding), which results in a **downfield shift** (larger $\\delta$ value). The line shape is affected by the rate of chemical exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$).\n\n1.  **Labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ Proton:**\n    *   **In $S_2$ (methanol):** The hydrogen bonding to the methanol solvent deshields the phenolic proton, causing a **downfield shift** relative to $S_1$. Crucially, the phenolic proton is chemically exchangeable with the hydroxyl protons of the methanol solvent. In a protic solvent, this exchange is very fast. When the exchange rate is on the order of the NMR frequency difference between the exchanging sites, it leads to significant **line broadening**.\n    *   **In $S_3$ (DMSO):** The strong hydrogen bond to the DMSO oxygen causes significant deshielding and a large **downfield shift**. Since DMSO is aprotic, the phenolic proton does not exchange with the solvent. Exchange can still occur with other solute molecules or trace amounts of water, but the overall exchange rate ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) is much slower than in the protic network of $S_2$. This slower exchange results in a **sharper signal** for the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton compared to its appearance in methanol. Therefore, the broadening is more pronounced in $S_2$ than in $S_3$.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**\n*   **In $S_2$ (methanol) vs. $S_1$:**\n    *   IR $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$: Significant red-shift, increased intensity.\n    *   IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$: Significant red-shift, marked broadening.\n    *   NMR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$: Downfield shift, significant broadening due to fast exchange.\n*   **In $S_3$ (DMSO) vs. $S_1$:**\n    *   IR $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$: Small red-shift.\n    *   IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$: Large red-shift, moderate broadening (less than in $S_2$).\n    *   NMR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$: Large downfield shift, less broadened signal than in $S_2$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. In $S_2$ (high $\\alpha$), the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch red-shifts and gains intensity; the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts and markedly broadens. In $S_3$ (high $\\beta$, $\\alpha=0$), the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch shows only a small shift, whereas the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts but broadens less than in $S_2$. In $^1$H NMR, the labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton shifts downfield in both $S_2$ and $S_3$, with more pronounced line broadening in $S_2$ due to faster exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) within a protic hydrogen-bond network.**\n    *   This option aligns perfectly with our detailed analysis. The description of IR shifts and broadening for both $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ and $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ groups in both solvents is correct. The description of NMR shifts and relative line broadening is also correct.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. In $S_2$, the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch blue-shifts because the high dielectric constant increases $k$; the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch red-shifts and narrows because hydrogen bonding makes the bond more harmonic. In $^1$H NMR, the labile $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton shifts upfield in $S_2$ because hydrogen bonding increases shielding.**\n    *   The claim of a blue-shift for the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch is incorrect; H-bonding causes a red-shift. The claim that the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ band narrows is incorrect; it broadens significantly in protic solvents. The claim of an upfield NMR shift is incorrect; H-bonding deshields, causing a downfield shift.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Increasing $\\varepsilon_r$ from $S_1$ to $S_2$ and $S_3$ universally blue-shifts both $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ and $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ IR bands; hydrogen bonding has negligible impact on IR positions compared to dielectric effects. In $^1$H NMR, labile proton chemical shifts are invariant across these solvents.**\n    *   The prediction of universal blue-shifts is incorrect. The assertion that H-bonding effects are negligible compared to dielectric effects is fundamentally wrong. The claim of invariant labile proton shifts is also incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. In $S_2$, the $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ stretch red-shifts but the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch blue-shifts because protic solvents donate hydrogen bonds that stiffen $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$. In $S_3$, the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton in $^1$H NMR is upfield relative to $S_1$ because aprotic solvents have higher $\\varepsilon_r$ but do not deshield labile protons; line shapes are broader in $S_3$ than $S_2$ due to slower exchange.**\n    *   The claim that the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch blue-shifts is incorrect; it red-shifts because H-bonding weakens the bond. The claim of an upfield NMR shift in $S_3$ is incorrect; the strong H-bond to DMSO causes a large downfield shift. The claim that the line shape is broader in $S_3$ than in $S_2$ is generally incorrect; the protic network in $S_2$ typically causes more pronounced broadening.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A provides a scientifically sound and complete description of the phenomena.",
