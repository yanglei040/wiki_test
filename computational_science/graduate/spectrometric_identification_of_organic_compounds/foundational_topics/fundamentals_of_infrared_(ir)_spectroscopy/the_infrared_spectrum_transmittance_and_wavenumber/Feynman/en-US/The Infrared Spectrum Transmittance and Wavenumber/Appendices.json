            "problem": "An organic carbonyl compound exhibits two pronounced absorption bands in its infrared spectrum at wavenumbers $1705\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $1680\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Compared to a typical isolated carbonyl stretching fundamental, the higher-wavenumber band is weaker while the lower-wavenumber band is stronger than expected. A separate anharmonic vibrational analysis (for example, via vibrational second-order perturbation theory applied to an isotopically shifted reference system to decouple interactions) predicts that, in the absence of interaction, the unperturbed carbonyl stretching fundamental would lie at $\\tilde{\\nu}_{1}^{(0)}=1694.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and a nearby unperturbed combination band would lie at $\\tilde{\\nu}_{2}^{(0)}=1691.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\nAssume that the anomalous intensities and observed doublet arise from Fermi resonance between these two near-degenerate vibrational levels.

The two observed band positions correspond to the eigenvalues of this coupled system.\n\nStarting from fundamental principles of two-level mixing, use the observed splitting and the given unperturbed levels to estimate the coupling parameter $V$. Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the final value of $V$ in $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a classic case of Fermi resonance in vibrational spectroscopy, a well-established quantum mechanical phenomenon. All provided data are physically plausible and internally consistent, allowing for a unique solution via a standard theoretical model.\n\nThe physical situation involves the interaction, or coupling, between two near-degenerate vibrational energy levels: a fundamental carbonyl stretching mode and a combination band. This interaction is known as Fermi resonance. We can model this system using the principles of quantum mechanical two-level mixing. Per the problem statement, we will use a $2 \\times 2$ Hermitian Hamiltonian matrix, $\\mathbf{H}$, to describe the coupled system. The energies can be conveniently expressed in units of wavenumbers ($\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$), as is common practice in spectroscopy.\n\nThe diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian, $H_{11}$ and $H_{22}$, are the energies of the unperturbed, non-interacting states. The problem provides these as $\\tilde{\\nu}_{1}^{(0)} = 1694.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for the carbonyl fundamental and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{2}^{(0)} = 1691.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for the combination band. The off-diagonal elements, $H_{12} = H_{21} = V$, represent the coupling interaction energy between the two states. The parameter $V$ is a real-valued constant whose magnitude we are tasked to find.

The eigenvalues, which we denote as $\\tilde{\\nu}_{obs}$, are the solutions to the secular equation, $\\det(\\mathbf{H} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{obs}\\mathbf{I}) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\tilde{\\nu}_{1}^{(0)} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{obs} & V \\\\ V & \\tilde{\\nu}_{2}^{(0)} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{obs} \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the characteristic polynomial:\n$$\n(\\tilde{\\nu}_{1}^{(0)} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{obs})(\\tilde{\\nu}_{2}^{(0)} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{obs}) - V^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $\\tilde{\\nu}_{obs}$, whose two solutions represent the energies of the resulting perturbed states.
