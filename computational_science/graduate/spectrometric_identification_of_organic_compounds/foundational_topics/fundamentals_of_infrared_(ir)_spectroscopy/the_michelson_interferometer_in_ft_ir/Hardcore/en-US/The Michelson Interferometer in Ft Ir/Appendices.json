This is achieved by modulating the light in a Michelson interferometer. This first practice problem  delves into the core of this principle, asking you to calculate the signal frequency generated by a reference laser based on the interferometer's design parameters, such as mirror velocity and the system's target spectral range. Mastering this relationship is the first step to understanding how an FT-IR instrument is designed and operated.",

            "problem": "An engineer is designing a modern Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The core of the instrument is a Michelson interferometer, where a moving mirror scans at a constant velocity, $v$. This motion modulates the incoming infrared radiation, creating an interferogram that is measured by a detector. This time-domain signal is then digitized by an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) before a Fourier transform is applied to recover the frequency-domain spectrum.\n\nThe spectrometer is designed to measure spectra up to a maximum wavenumber of $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{max}} = 4000 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. The ADC selected for the system has a fixed sampling rate of $f_s = 50.0 \\text{ kHz}$. To prevent signal aliasing and to optimize the use of the ADC, the engineer sets the mirror velocity, $v$, such that the highest frequency component in the infrared interferogram (corresponding to $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{max}}$) is exactly 80.0% of the Nyquist frequency of the ADC.\n\nFor precise tracking of the mirror's position and velocity, the instrument also incorporates a Helium-Neon (HeNe) reference laser. This laser's beam passes through the same interferometer and its interferogram is measured by a separate detector. The HeNe laser emits highly stable, monochromatic light with a wavenumber of $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{HeNe}} = 15798 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n\nGiven this design, calculate the frequency of the sinusoidal interferogram signal generated by the HeNe reference laser. Express your answer in kilohertz (kHz) and round it to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "In a Michelson interferometer, the signal frequency $f$ produced by monochromatic radiation of wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is given by $f = 2v\\tilde{\\nu}$, where $v$ is the velocity of the moving mirror.\n\nFirst, we must determine the mirror velocity $v$ based on the design constraints for the infrared measurement.

            "solution": "The problem has three parts: determining the maximum optical path difference (OPD), finding the maximum allowable mirror velocity, and calculating the total acquisition time.\n\n**Part 1: Resolution and Maximum Optical Path Difference ($L$)**\n\nThe instrumental line shape (ILS) for a two-sided interferogram truncated by a rectangular window from $-L$ to $+L$ is the Fourier transform of that window.\n$$ \\text{ILS}(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\int_{-L}^{L} e^{-i2\\pi\\tilde{\\nu}\\delta} \\,d\\delta = \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi\\tilde{\\nu}L)}{\\pi\\tilde{\\nu}} = 2L\\,\\text{sinc}(2\\pi\\tilde{\\nu}L) $$\nThe resolution, $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{target}}$, is defined as the wavenumber separation between the line center ($\\tilde{\\nu}=0$) and the first zero of the ILS.

Consider an instrument whose moving mirror carriage runs along a steel arm of nominal length $L$ and whose metrology of mirror displacement is referenced to a steel encoder scale fabricated and calibrated at temperature $T_{0}$. The instrument does not use an independent optical reference for the wavenumber scale; instead, the sampled optical path difference coordinate is computed from the mechanical displacement according to the scale defined at $T_{0}$. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the steel arm and encoder is $\\alpha = 12 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, and the temperature during operation is $T = T_{0} + \\Delta T$.\n\nStarting from (i) the definition of linear thermal expansion, (ii) the definition of wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ as the Fourier conjugate variable to optical path difference $s$ via the interferogram relation $I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S(\\tilde{\\nu}) \\cos(2 \\pi \\tilde{\\nu} s)\\, d\\tilde{\\nu}$, and (iii) the scaling property of the Fourier transform, derive an expression for the fractional error of the assigned wavenumber per unit temperature change caused by uniform thermal expansion of the steel arm and encoder scale.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the fractional wavenumber error per unit temperature change in an FTIR spectrometer and for the calculation of the absolute wavenumber error per kelvin for a specific spectral band. The error arises from the thermal expansion of the steel arm and encoder scale that provide the metrology for the moving mirror's displacement.\n\nLet $T_{0}$ be the calibration temperature of the steel encoder scale and $T = T_{0} + \\Delta T$ be the operating temperature. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion for the steel is given as $\\alpha = 12 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the true mechanical displacement of the mirror, $d_{true}$, and the displacement measured by the instrument's control system, $d_{measured}$. The encoder scale is calibrated at $T_{0}$, meaning the computer's internal conversion from encoder counts to distance is based on the physical dimensions at $T_{0}$. At the operating temperature $T$, the steel scale expands. A true physical displacement $d_{true}$ corresponds to a measured displacement $d_{measured} = d_{true} / (1 + \\alpha \\Delta T)$. It is more convenient to express the true displacement in terms of the measured one:\n$$d_{true} = d_{measured}(1 + \\alpha \\Delta T)$$\nThe optical path difference, $s$, in a Michelson interferometer is twice the mechanical displacement, $d$, of the mirror ($s = 2d$). Therefore, the relationship between the true optical path difference, $s_{true}$, and the measured (or assigned) optical path difference, $s_{measured}$, is:\n$$s_{true} = 2d_{true} = 2d_{measured}(1 + \\alpha \\Delta T) = s_{measured}(1 + \\alpha \\Delta T)$$\n\nThe true spectrum, $S_{true}(\\tilde{\\nu})$, is the Fourier cosine transform of the interferogram $I(s_{true})$. The instrument's computer, however, records the signal as a function of its calculated coordinate, $s_{measured}$. Let this be $I_{comp}(s_{measured}) = I(s_{true})$.\n$$I_{comp}(s_{measured}) = I(s_{measured}(1 + \\alpha \\Delta T))$$\nThe computer then calculates the measured spectrum, $S_{measured}(\\tilde{\\nu}_{measured})$, by performing a Fourier transform on $I_{comp}(s_{measured})$.\nWe invoke the scaling property of the Fourier transform: if $F(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\mathcal{F}\\{f(s)\\}$, then $\\mathcal{F}\\{f(as)\\} = \\frac{1}{a} F(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}}{a})$.\nHere, the scaling factor is $a = 1 + \\alpha \\Delta T$.
