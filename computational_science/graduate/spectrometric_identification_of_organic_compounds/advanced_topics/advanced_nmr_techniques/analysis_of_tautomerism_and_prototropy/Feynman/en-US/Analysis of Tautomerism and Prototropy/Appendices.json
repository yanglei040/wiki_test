For any first-order process, the relationship between the rate constant, $k$, and the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is given by:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nThis relationship applies to both the protio (H) and deuterio (D) isotopologues. The problem states that the NMR exchange experiments measure the half-lives for site-to-site magnetization transfer. For a symmetric two-site exchange, as specified in the problem ($p_{keto} = p_{enol} = 0.5$), the measured first-order rate constant of exchange, $k_{ex}$, is equal to the microscopic chemical rate constant of the tautomerization reaction.\n\nThus, we can write the chemical rate constants for the protio ($k_{\\mathrm{H}}$) and deuterio ($k_{\\mathrmD}$) systems in terms of their measured half-lives, $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}}$ and $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}}}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}}}$$\nThe primary kinetic isotope effect is the ratio of these rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)}$$\nThe $\\ln(2)$ term cancels, yielding a simple inverse relationship between the KIE and the half-lives:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}}}$$\nThis result is logically consistent: a faster reaction (larger $k$) corresponds to a shorter half-life.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$t_{1/2,\\mathrm{H}} = 4.81 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$t_{1/2,\\mathrm{D}} = 2.89 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the KIE:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{2.89 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}}{4.81 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}}$$\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{0.289}{0.0481} \\approx 6.008316$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures, consistent with the precision of the input data.\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\approx 6.01$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. A primary kinetic isotope effect is observed when a covalent bond to the isotopically substituted atom is broken or formed in the rate-determining step (RDS) of a reaction. The effect arises primarily from the difference in zero-point vibrational energies (ZPEs) of the bonds involving the lighter and heavier isotopes. The ZPE of a C-H (or O-H) bond is higher than that of the corresponding C-D (or O-D) bond. Consequently, more energy is required to break the bond to deuterium, leading to a slower reaction rate ($k_{\\mathrm{D}} < k_{\\mathrm{H}}$) and a KIE value, $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}}$, greater than $1$.\n\nFor the cleavage of a C-H versus a C-D bond at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the semiclassical model predicts a maximum KIE of approximately $7$ to $8$. The calculated value of $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}} \\approx 6.01$ is a large, significant primary KIE. Such a large value is strong evidence that the bond to the transferring hydrogen (or deuterium) is being broken in the rate-determining step of the tautomerization reaction under these catalytic conditions. If the transfer were not involved in the RDS, a much smaller secondary KIE (typically in the range of $0.9$ to $1.2$) would be expected. Therefore, we infer that the proton transfer is indeed part of the rate-determining step.",
