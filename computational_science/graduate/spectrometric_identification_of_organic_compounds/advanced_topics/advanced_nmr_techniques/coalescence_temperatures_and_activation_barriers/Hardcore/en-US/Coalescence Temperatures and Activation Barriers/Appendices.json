The phenomenon of hindered amide rotation, coalescence, and the use of the Eyring equation to relate rate constants to activation barriers are all fundamental concepts in physical organic chemistry.

The provided data and equipment specifications are sufficient for the task.\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The chemical system, the spectroscopic parameters, and the available equipment are all standard and realistic. The temperature range is well within the capabilities of standard VT-NMR equipment.\n6.  **Other Flaws**: The problem is not trivial, tautological, or ill-posed. It requires a substantive application of DNMR principles to evaluate complex experimental choices.\n\n### Verdict on Problem Validity\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It presents a realistic and well-defined scenario in experimental chemical physics.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving the theoretical basis for a DNMR experiment and then evaluating each proposed plan against these principles.\n\n**1. Fundamental Relationships**\n\nThe coalescence temperature, $T_c$, is the temperature at which two exchanging signals merge into a single broad peak. For two uncoupled sites of equal population (as is the case for the two N-methyl groups), the rate constant at coalescence, $k_c$, is related to the frequency separation of the signals in the slow-exchange limit, $\\Delta \\nu$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$), by the equation:\n$$ k_c = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta \\nu}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThe frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu$ is directly proportional to the spectrometer's operating frequency, $\\nu_0$ (in $\\mathrm{MHz}$), and the chemical shift separation, $\\Delta \\delta$ (in $\\mathrm{ppm}$):\n$$ \\Delta \\nu (\\mathrm{Hz}) = \\Delta \\delta (\\mathrm{ppm}) \\times \\nu_0 (\\mathrm{MHz}) $$\nThis shows that $\\Delta \\nu$, and consequently $k_c$ and $T_c$, are dependent on the magnetic field strength of the spectrometer.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the rate constant $k$ is described by the Eyring equation:\n$$ k(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} / RT} $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. We can use the given estimate of $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} \\approx 62\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ to predict $T_c$ for each available spectrometer.\n\n**2. Estimation of Coalescence Temperature ($T_c$)**\n\nLet's estimate $T_c$ for the highest field spectrometer to see where it falls within the accessible temperature range.\n- Spectrometer: $800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$\n- $\\Delta \\delta = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{ppm} = 0.20 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $\\Delta \\nu = (0.20 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (800 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) = 160\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $k_c = \\frac{\\pi (160\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 355.4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nSetting $k = k_c$ in the Eyring equation (assuming transmission coefficient $\\kappa=1$):\n$$ 355.4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) T_c}{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}} e^{-62000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} / (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}\\,mol^{-1}} T_c)} $$\nSolving this transcendental equation for $T_c$ numerically yields $T_c \\approx 315\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The uncertainty in $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ($\\pm 3\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) translates to a range for the predicted $T_c$ of approximately $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $330\\,\\mathrm{K}$. All potential $T_c$ values are well within the instrument's VT range of $[270, 360]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n**3. Principles of a Good Experimental Plan**\nA robust plan to determine $T_c$ and acquire data for further analysis should include:\n- **Optimal Instrument Choice**: A higher field (e.g., $800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$) is generally preferable as it maximizes $\\Delta \\nu$. This leads to a higher, more accurately measurable $T_c$ and provides greater spectral dispersion, which improves the precision of subsequent line-shape analysis.\n- **Accurate Temperature Control and Measurement**: The probe temperature must be accurately calibrated using a standard (e.g., methanol or ethylene glycol). The manufacturer-specified stability ($\\pm 0.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$) ensures temperature constancy during an experiment but does not guarantee absolute accuracy. Inaccurate temperature values are a major source of error in determining activation parameters.\n- **Stable Magnetic Field**: A deuterated solvent (e.g., the specified $\\mathrm{CD_{2}Cl_{2}}$) must be used to provide a deuterium signal for the field-frequency lock system, ensuring field stability over the course of the multi-temperature experiment.\n- **Thermal Equilibration**: Sufficient time must be allowed for the sample to reach thermal equilibrium at each new temperature setpoint before data acquisition.\n- **Efficient Sampling Strategy**: An adaptive temperature grid is most efficient. One starts with coarse steps far from $T_c$ to establish the baseline and then switches to fine steps (e.g., $1-2\\,\\mathrm{K}$) in the region of coalescence to pinpoint $T_c$ accurately.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR at $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. Estimate $T_c \\approx 315\\,\\mathrm{K}$ by directly comparing $\\Delta \\delta$ in $\\mathrm{ppm}$ to the exchange rate. Collect spectra only from $300$ to $330\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in $5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ increments. Temperature calibration is unnecessary if the VT unit is specified to $\\pm 0.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n- The reasoning \"comparing $\\Delta \\delta$ in $\\mathrm{ppm}$ to the exchange rate\" is physically nonsensical. One is a dimensionless ratio, the other has units of inverse time ($\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$).\n- The temperature increment of $5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is too large to locate $T_c$ with the required $\\pm 2\\,\\mathrm{K}$ precision.\n- The claim that temperature calibration is unnecessary is a serious experimental error. Stability does not equal accuracy. This would compromise any subsequent Eyring analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Use $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR at $150\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ (on the $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ magnet) to exploit larger chemical-shift dispersion in $\\mathrm{ppm}$. Collect spectra from $250$ to $360\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in $10\\,\\mathrm{K}$ increments with $32$ scans per temperature, without deuterated solvent or temperature calibration, assuming that coalescence broadening will be obvious.**\n- Using $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR is a poor choice. Despite a potentially larger $\\Delta\\delta$, the low natural abundance ($~1.1\\%$) and smaller magnetogyric ratio of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ lead to vastly lower sensitivity compared to $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$. A VT experiment would be prohibitively time-consuming.\n- The instruction to proceed \"without deuterated solvent\" is a fatal flaw. A stable field-frequency lock is essential for any modern NMR experiment, especially one involving signal averaging and precise frequency measurements over time.\n- The proposed lower temperature of $250\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is outside the specified operating range of the VT unit ($[270, 360]\\,\\mathrm{K}$).\n- A $10\\,\\mathrm{K}$ temperature increment is far too coarse.\n- Forgoing temperature calibration is poor practice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR at $800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ to maximize absolute frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu$ in $\\mathrm{Hz}$. Predict $T_c$ by converting the slow-exchange $\\Delta \\delta$ to $\\Delta \\nu$ and combining the exchange-rate criterion with the temperature dependence of $k$ from kinetic theory. Bracket with $5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ steps from $285$ to $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, then $2\\,\\mathrm{K}$ steps from $300$ to $312\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and finally $1\\,\\mathrm{K}$ steps over $304$–$308\\,\\mathrm{K}$ once broadening starts. Use a deuterated solvent for a stable lock, calibrate the VT probe (e.g., methanol or ethylene glycol standard), allow equilibration at each $T$ until the reported and actual temperatures agree, and record $\\Delta \\nu$ in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ for subsequent analysis.**\n- This plan correctly identifies the advantage of using the highest-field spectrometer ($800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$) to maximize $\\Delta \\nu$.\n- It employs a sound theoretical approach to estimate $T_c$ as a guide.\n- The proposed adaptive temperature sampling strategy (coarse steps far from $T_c$, fine steps near $T_c$) is efficient and will allow determination of $T_c$ to the required precision. The specified temperature windows are a reasonable starting point based on the estimated $T_c$.\n- It explicitly includes all elements of good experimental practice: using a deuterated solvent for a lock, performing temperature calibration, allowing for thermal equilibration, and recording the key data ($\\Delta \\nu$).\nThis plan is scientifically rigorous, thorough, and well-designed to meet the objectives.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Use $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR at $400\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. Assume the spectrometer field does not influence $T_c$. Collect spectra from $270$ to $360\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in $10\\,\\mathrm{K}$ increments without refining near the onset of broadening, because coalescence can be identified visually from the merged peak shape.**\n- The assumption that the spectrometer field does not influence $T_c$ is fundamentally false. As derived earlier, $T_c$ is a function of $\\Delta \\nu$, which is directly proportional to the field strength.\n- The $400\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ instrument provides the smallest $\\Delta \\nu$, making line-shape analysis less precise.\n- A $10\\,\\mathrm{K}$ sampling interval is too coarse for the stated goal. A purely visual identification of coalescence is not sufficiently quantitative for a precision of $\\pm 2\\,\\mathrm{K}$ or for rigorous kinetic analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

For a base-catalyzed process, this observed rate constant depends on the base concentration $[B]$ according to the relation $k_{obs} = k_{m} [B]^m$, where $k_m$ is the true rate constant of order $(m+1)$ and $m$ is the reaction order with respect to the base.\n\nAt coalescence, the observed rate constant reaches a specific value $k_c$, which is determined by the frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu_0$. For a two-site, equally populated exchange, $k_c = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta\\nu_0}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Since $\\Delta\\nu_0$ for Compound X is fixed at $120\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $k_c$ is a constant for all three experiments.\n\nAccording to Transition State Theory, the temperature dependence of the rate constant $k_m$ is given by the Eyring-Polanyi equation (assuming a transmission coefficient $\\kappa=1$):\n$$k_m(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\nSubstituting $\\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\Delta H^\\ddagger - T \\Delta S^\\ddagger$:\n$$k_m(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger - T\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right)$$\nAt the coalescence temperature $T_c$, we have $k_c = k_m(T_c) [B]^m$.\n$$k_c = \\left[ \\frac{k_B T_c}{h} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT_c}\\right) \\right] [B]^m$$\nSince $k_c$ is constant, we can take the natural logarithm and compare two different conditions (denoted by subscripts $1$ and $2$):\n$$\\ln(k_c) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h}\\right) + \\ln(T_{c1}) + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT_{c1}} + m\\ln([B_1])$$\n$$\\ln(k_c) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h}\\right) + \\ln(T_{c2}) + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\ddagger}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{RT_{c2}} + m\\ln([B_2])$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$$0 = \\ln(T_{c1}) - \\ln(T_{c2}) - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{c1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{c2}}\\right) + m\\left(\\ln([B_1]) - \\ln([B_2])\\right)$$\nRearranging to solve for $m$:\n$$m \\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{[B_2]}{[B_1]}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{c1}}{T_{c2}}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{c1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{c2}}\\right)$$\nWe are given $\\Delta H^\\ddagger = 30\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 30000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\nThus, $\\frac{\\Delta H^\\ddagger}{R} = \\frac{30000}{8.314} \\approx 3608.4\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nLet's use the first two data points:\n- Point 1: $T_{c1} = 259\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $[B_1] = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- Point 2: $T_{c2} = 238\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $[B_2] = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$$m \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.100}{0.050}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{259}{238}\\right) - 3608.4\\,\\mathrm{K} \\left(\\frac{1}{259\\,\\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{238\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)$$\n$$m \\ln(2) = \\ln(1.0882) - 3608.4 \\times (0.003861 - 0.004202)\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$$\n$$m(0.693) = 0.0845 - 3608.4 \\times (-0.000341)$$\n$$m(0.693) = 0.0845 + 1.2307 = 1.3152$$\n$$m = \\frac{1.3152}{0.693} \\approx 1.898$$\n\nLet's use the second and third data points for confirmation:\n- Point 2: $T_{c2} = 238\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $[B_2] = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- Point 3: $T_{c3} = 215\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $[B_3] = 0.200\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$$m \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.200}{0.100}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{238}{215}\\right) - 3608.4\\,\\mathrm{K} \\left(\\frac{1}{238\\,\\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{215\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)$$\n$$m \\ln(2) = \\ln(1.1070) - 3608.4 \\times (0.004202 - 0.004651)\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$$\n$$m(0.693) = 0.1017 - 3608.4 \\times (-0.000449)$$\n$$m(0.693) = 0.1017 + 1.6202 = 1.7219$$\n$$m = \\frac{1.7219}{0.693} \\approx 2.485$$\n\nThe calculated values for $m$ are $\\approx 1.90$ and $\\approx 2.49$. The average is $\\approx 2.2$. Given potential experimental uncertainties in the data, it is reasonable to infer that the reaction order $m$ with respect to the base is $2$. This is consistent with a mechanism where two molecules of base are involved in the rate-determining step of proton transfer. The observation that $T_c$ decreases as $[B]$ increases is also consistent with a base-catalyzed reaction as explained before.\n\n### Analysis of Compound Y: Molecularity and Rate Law\nCompound Y undergoes an intramolecular conformational exchange. By definition, an intramolecular process involves only a single molecule. The rate of such a process is not dependent on the concentration of other species in the solution, such as the added base $[B]$. The rate law is first-order: $\\text{rate} = k[\\text{Y}]$.\nThe rate constant $k$ is a function of temperature only:\n$$k(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right)$$\nAt coalescence, $k(T_c) = k_c$, where $k_c$ is a constant determined by $\\Delta \\nu_0 = 80\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Since $k$ does not depend on $[B]$, the temperature $T_c$ required to achieve the rate $k_c$ is also independent of $[B]$. This perfectly rationalizes the experimental observation that $T_c$ remains constant at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ even when the base concentration is varied.\n\n### Calculation of $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ for Compound Y\nThe free energy of activation, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$, is related to the activation enthalpy, $\\Delta H^\\ddagger$, and activation entropy, $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$, by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\Delta H^\\ddagger - T \\Delta S^\\ddagger$$\nFor Compound Y at its coalescence temperature $T_c = 302\\,\\mathrm{K}$, we use the provided thermodynamic data:\n- $\\Delta H^\\ddagger = 65\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 65000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $\\Delta S^\\ddagger = -20\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = T_c = 302\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 65000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - (302\\,\\mathrm{K} \\times -20\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})$$\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 65000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - (-6040\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})$$\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 65000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} + 6040\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = 71040\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nConverting back to $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$\\Delta G^\\ddagger = 71.04\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThus, the free energy of activation for Compound Y at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $71\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A. Compound X exhibits an intermolecular proton exchange with overall second-order dependence on base concentration ($m \\approx 2$), consistent with the decrease of $T_c$ upon increasing $[B]$; Compound Y exhibits intramolecular first-order conformational exchange with $T_c$ independent of $[B]$, and $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $71\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n  - This option correctly states that Compound X has an approximate second-order dependence on base ($m \\approx 2$), which is consistent with our calculations. It correctly rationalizes the $T_c$ trend. It correctly identifies Compound Y as an intramolecular first-order process with $T_c$ independent of $[B]$. It correctly calculates $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ for Compound Y as $\\approx 71\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Every part of this statement is consistent with our analysis.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Compound X is first-order intramolecular (no base dependence), while Compound Y is second-order in base; for Compound Y, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $59\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n  - The characterization of both Compound X and Compound Y is incorrect, directly contradicting the experimental data ($T_c$ changes for X and is constant for Y). The calculated value for $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is also incorrect. A value of $59\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ would arise from incorrectly using a positive $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$ in the calculation ($65 - 302 \\times (20/1000) = 58.96$).\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Both Compound X and Compound Y are first-order intramolecular processes with $T_c$ independent of $[B]$; for Compound Y, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ equals $\\Delta H^\\ddagger = 65\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n  - The characterization of Compound X is incorrect; its $T_c$ clearly depends on $[B]$. The statement that $\\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\Delta H^\\ddagger$ is incorrect because it implies $\\Delta S^\\ddagger = 0$, whereas it is given as $-20\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Both Compound X and Compound Y are second-order in base; $T_c$ increases with $[B]$ due to reduced Larmor separation, and for Compound Y $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ at $302\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately $77\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n  - The characterization of Compound Y is incorrect; its $T_c$ is independent of $[B]$. The statement that $T_c$ *increases* with $[B]$ for Compound X is the opposite of the data given. The reasoning (`reduced Larmor separation`) is also false; the problem states $\\Delta\\nu_0$ (the frequency separation, related to Larmor frequencies) is fixed. The value for $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem addresses the phenomenon of chemical exchange in a coupled $AX$ spin system, as observed by NMR spectroscopy. First, we must understand why the simple coalescence criterion, $k_c = \\pi \\Delta \\nu / \\sqrt{2}$, which is valid for a single uncoupled resonance undergoing two-site exchange, is insufficient here.\n\nIn the slow exchange limit (low temperature), the spectrum consists of two superimposed $AX$ patterns, one for each conformer $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\\mathcal{C}_2$.\n-   Let the chemical shifts of nucleus A in the two conformers be $\\nu_{A1}$ and $\\nu_{A2}$, and for nucleus X be $\\nu_{X1}$ and $\\nu_{X2}$. The given frequency differences are $\\Delta \\nu_A = |\\nu_{A1} - \\nu_{A2}| = 120\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $\\Delta \\nu_X = |\\nu_{X1} - \\nu_{X2}| = 40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n-   The scalar couplings are $J_1 = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $J_2 = 9.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe spectrum of an $AX$ system consists of two doublets. So, for two conformers, we will observe a total of four doublets (eight lines) in the slow exchange limit. The exchange process $\\mathcal{C}_1 \\rightleftharpoons \\mathcal{C}_2$ interconverts these lines. Crucially, the exchange process does not alter the spin state of either nucleus. This means we must consider the exchange between transitions corresponding to the same spin state of the passive (non-flipped) nucleus.\n\nLet's analyze the transitions for nucleus A. The A-nucleus resonance is split into a doublet by the coupling to the X-nucleus, which can be in spin state $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$.\n1.  The A-transition when the X-nucleus has spin $\\alpha$: This transition occurs at frequency $\\nu_{A1} + J_1/2$ in $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and at $\\nu_{A2} + J_2/2$ in $\\mathcal{C}_2$. These two lines exchange with each other. The frequency separation between this pair of exchanging lines is $\\delta_1 = |(\\nu_{A1} + J_1/2) - (\\nu_{A2} + J_2/2)| = |(\\nu_{A1} - \\nu_{A2}) + (J_1 - J_2)/2| = |\\Delta\\nu_A + \\Delta J/2|$.\n2.  The A-transition when the X-nucleus has spin $\\beta$: This transition occurs at frequency $\\nu_{A1} - J_1/2$ in $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and at $\\nu_{A2} - J_2/2$ in $\\mathcal{C}_2$. The separation is $\\delta_2 = |(\\nu_{A1} - J_1/2) - (\\nu_{A2} - J_2/2)| = |(\\nu_{A1} - \\nu_{A2}) - (J_1 - J_2)/2| = |\\Delta\\nu_A - \\Delta J/2|$.\n\nSimilarly, for the X-nucleus transitions:\n3.  The X-transition when the A-nucleus has spin $\\alpha$: The separation is $\\delta_3 = |\\Delta\\nu_X + \\Delta J/2|$.\n4.  The X-transition when the A-nucleus has spin $\\beta$: The separation is $\\delta_4 = |\\Delta\\nu_X - \\Delta J/2|$.\n\nHere, $\\Delta J = J_1 - J_2$. The system is not characterized by a single frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu$, but by four distinct separations: $\\{|\\Delta\\nu_A \\pm \\Delta J/2|, |\\Delta\\nu_X \\pm \\Delta J/2|\\}$. This is the fundamental reason why the simple coalescence formula fails. Each of these four pairs will coalesce at a different exchange rate, given by $k_{c,i} = \\pi \\delta_i / \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's calculate these separations using the given data:\n-   $\\Delta\\nu_A = 120\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   $\\Delta\\nu_X = 40\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   $\\Delta J = J_1 - J_2 = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz} - 9.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = -2.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   $\\Delta J/2 = -1.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nThe four separations are:\n-   $\\delta_{A_1} = |\\Delta\\nu_A + \\Delta J/2| = |120 - 1.0| = 119\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   $\\delta_{A_2} = |\\Delta\\nu_A - \\Delta J/2| = |120 - (-1.0)| = 121\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   $\\delta_{X_1} = |\\Delta\\nu_X + \\Delta J/2| = |40 - 1.0| = 39\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   $\\delta_{X_2} = |\\Delta\\nu_X - \\Delta J/2| = |40 - (-1.0)| = 41\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nThe set of separations is $\\{119, 121, 39, 41\\}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe term \"coalescence\" for the entire multiplet is not uniquely defined. It could refer to the rate at which the first pair of lines merges (governed by $\\delta_{\\min}$) or the rate at which the last pair merges (governed by $\\delta_{\\max}$). We must now evaluate the options based on this framework.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The traditional $k_c$ fails because it assumes a single, uncoupled transition; in an $A X$ system, each site produces transitions at $A$ frequencies $\\nu_{A i} \\pm J_i/2$ and $X$ frequencies $\\nu_{X i} \\pm J_i/2$, so exchange mixes pairs of transitions whose separations are $|\\Delta \\nu_A \\pm \\Delta J/2|$ and $|\\Delta \\nu_X \\pm \\Delta J/2|$, where $\\Delta J = J_1 - J_2$. A corrected criterion is $k_c \\approx \\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\delta_{\\min}$ with $\\delta_{\\min} = \\min\\!\\big\\{|\\Delta \\nu_A \\pm \\Delta J/2|,\\;|\\Delta \\nu_X \\pm \\Delta J/2|\\big\\}$. For the given parameters, $\\Delta J = -2\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $\\delta_{\\min} = 39\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, hence $k_c \\approx 86.6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $T_c \\approx 266\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n\n_Analysis_: The explanation for why the traditional formula fails is physically correct and accurately derived. It correctly identifies the four relevant frequency separations. The proposed criterion uses the minimum separation, $\\delta_{\\min} = 39\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This corresponds to the coalescence of the inner pair of lines in the X-multiplet, which is the first coalescence event to occur as temperature increases.\nLet's check the calculations:\n-   $k_c \\approx \\dfrac{\\pi \\times 39\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 86.63\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The value $86.6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ is correct.\n-   Now, we must find the temperature $T_c$ at which $k = k_c$ using the Eyring equation:\n    $k_c = \\dfrac{k_B T_c}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{R T_c}\\right)$.\n-   Let's check the proposed $T_c \\approx 266\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n    $k = \\dfrac{1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}}{6.6261 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}} (266\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{55000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} \\times 266\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)$\n    $k \\approx (2.0836 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}K^{-1}})(266\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\exp(-24.874)$\n    $k \\approx (5.542 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) (1.571 \\times 10^{-11}) \\approx 87.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n    This calculated rate of $87.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ is extremely close to the target rate of $86.6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding of constants. The option is internally consistent both in its physical reasoning and its numerical calculations.\n_Verdict_: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The traditional $k_c$ fails for coupled spins, and the corrected criterion is to use the largest transition separation, $k_c \\approx \\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\delta_{\\max}$ with $\\delta_{\\max} = \\max\\!\\big\\{|\\Delta \\nu_A \\pm \\Delta J/2|,\\;|\\Delta \\nu_X \\pm \\Delta J/2|\\big\\}$. For the given parameters, $\\delta_{\\max} = 121\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, so $k_c \\approx 269\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $T_c \\approx 280\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n\n_Analysis_: This option also correctly identifies the set of relevant separations. It proposes using the maximum separation, $\\delta_{\\max} = 121\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is a common practical definition for the overall coalescence of the multiplet (when the last pair of lines merges).\n-   Let's check the calculations:\n    $k_c \\approx \\dfrac{\\pi \\times 121\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 268.8\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The value $269\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ is correct.\n-   Now, let's check the claimed coalescence temperature $T_c \\approx 280\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n    $k = (2.0836 \\times 10^{10})(280) \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{55000}{8.314 \\times 280}\\right)$\n    $k \\approx (5.834 \\times 10^{12}) \\exp(-23.630) \\approx (5.834 \\times 10^{12}) (5.463 \\times 10^{-11}) \\approx 318.6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n    The calculated rate $k \\approx 318.6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ at $T=280\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is significantly different from the rate $k_c \\approx 269\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ calculated from $\\delta_{\\max}$. The temperature corresponding to $k_c = 269\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ is approximately $278\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This option contains a significant numerical inconsistency.\n_Verdict_: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The traditional $k_c$ fails only because there are multiple lines, but the coupling $J$ does not affect the coalescence rate; one should therefore use the smallest of the isolated chemical-shift separations, $k_c \\approx \\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} \\min(\\Delta \\nu_A,\\Delta \\nu_X)$. For the given parameters, $k_c \\approx \\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\times 40\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 88.8\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, yielding $T_c \\approx 267\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n\n_Analysis_: The premise of this option, that the change in coupling constant $\\Delta J$ does not affect the coalescence rate, is fundamentally incorrect. As derived above, the separations of the exchanging line pairs are explicitly dependent on $\\Delta J/2$. The proposed criterion is physically flawed.\n_Verdict_: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The traditional $k_c$ fails because of multiple separations, and a corrected criterion is to take a root-sum-square over all differences, $k_c \\approx \\dfrac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\Delta \\nu_A^2 + \\Delta \\nu_X^2 + (\\Delta J/2)^2}$. For the given parameters, this gives $k_c \\approx 281\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $T_c \\approx 281\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n\n_Analysis_: This option proposes an ad-hoc mathematical construct (root-sum-square) that has no theoretical basis in the Gutowsky-Holm-McConnell theory of exchange broadening. The coalescence phenomenon applies to individual pairs of exchanging lines, not to an arbitrary combination of their frequency differences. The physical model is incorrect. Furthermore, there is a numerical inconsistency:\n-   At $T_c = 281\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the rate constant is $k \\approx (2.0836 \\times 10^{10})(281) \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{55000}{8.314 \\times 281}\\right) \\approx 332\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ (note: a more precise calculation yields $385\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), which is not close to the value $k_c\\approx 281\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ proposed in the option.\n_Verdict_: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A provides a correct physical explanation for the failure of the simple coalescence model in a coupled system, correctly derives the relevant frequency separations, proposes a physically meaningful (though not unique) criterion for coalescence, and, most importantly, provides a set of numerical results that are internally consistent. The other options are flawed either in their physical reasoning, their numerical calculations, or both.",
