## Introduction
While positive ion mass spectrometry is widely utilized, the realm of negative ion mass spectrometry offers a distinct and powerful set of analytical tools, essential for the comprehensive characterization of many organic compounds. The generation, stability, and fragmentation of negative ions are governed by unique physicochemical principles that differ significantly from their positive ion counterparts. A thorough understanding of this anion chemistry is crucial for effective method development and accurate data interpretation, yet this knowledge is often a gap for analysts primarily trained in positive ion modes. This article aims to fill that gap by providing a systematic exploration of negative ion mass spectrometry.

This comprehensive journey will equip you with the expertise to confidently apply negative ion mass spectrometry in your own research.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The generation of negative ions from neutral analyte molecules is governed by a distinct set of physicochemical principles that differ significantly from those governing positive ion formation. Whereas positive ions are typically formed by protonation or the removal of an electron, negative ions are primarily generated through electron attachment, deprotonation, or anion adduction. The predominance of one pathway over another is dictated by the intrinsic electronic and structural properties of the analyte, the chemical environment of the ion source, and the [specific energy](@entry_id:271007) regime of the ionization technique. This chapter will systematically explore these fundamental principles and their practical application in common negative ion [mass spectrometry](@entry_id:147216) techniques.

### Fundamental Pathways of Negative Ion Formation

Three principal mechanisms account for the conversion of a neutral molecule, $\mathrm{M}$, into a negative ion in the gas phase: [electron capture](@entry_id:158629), deprotonation, and anion attachment. Understanding the thermochemical and kinetic requirements for each is essential for predicting ionization behavior and selecting an appropriate analytical strategy.

#### Electron Capture

Electron capture is the process by which a neutral molecule captures a free electron to form a molecular radical anion, denoted $\mathrm{M}^{-\bullet}$. This process is fundamental to techniques like Electron Capture Negative Ionization (ECNI).

$$
\mathrm{M} + e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{M}^{-\bullet}
$$

The thermodynamic viability of forming a stable radical anion is determined by the **[electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) (EA)** of the molecule. The electron affinity is defined as the energy released when a gaseous neutral atom or molecule in its ground state captures an electron to form a gaseous anion in its ground state. A positive electron affinity indicates that the anion is more stable than the neutral molecule and a free electron, making the capture process exothermic. Conversely, a negative [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) signifies that the anion is thermodynamically unstable and will spontaneously autodetach the electron; such species cannot be observed as stable ions in a mass spectrometer.

The propensity of an element to capture an electron is intimately tied to its [electronic configuration](@entry_id:272104). For instance, atoms with nearly filled valence shells, such as fluorine ($[\mathrm{He}]\,2s^{2}2p^{5}$), have high positive electron affinities because capturing an electron results in a stable, closed-shell configuration. However, atoms with already stable configurations, such as nitrogen ($[\mathrm{He}]\,2s^{2}2p^{3}$), which has a half-filled $p$ subshell, or neon ($[\mathrm{He}]\,2s^{2}2p^{6}$), which has a filled valence shell, resist the addition of an electron. For these elements, the electron affinity is negative, and the [electron capture](@entry_id:158629) process is endothermic . Similarly, the addition of a second electron to a gaseous anion (e.g., $\mathrm{O}^{-}(g) + e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{O}^{2-}(g)$) is always strongly endothermic due to the powerful [electrostatic repulsion](@entry_id:162128) between the anion and the incoming electron .

From a kinetic standpoint, non-dissociative [electron capture](@entry_id:158629) is most efficient for low-energy electrons, often termed **thermal electrons**, with kinetic energies typically near or below $1\,\mathrm{eV}$ . This is because the [capture cross-section](@entry_id:263537) for many molecules is largest at near-zero electron energies. High-energy electrons, such as those used in standard positive-ion Electron Ionization (EI) at $70\,\mathrm{eV}$, are far more likely to cause fragmentation (dissociative electron attachment) or simply be scattered without being captured.

Consequently, the ideal analytes for [electron capture](@entry_id:158629) are molecules with structural features that can stabilize the additional negative charge, leading to a high positive electron affinity. Such features typically include extensive $\pi$-conjugation and, most importantly, the presence of strongly **[electron-withdrawing groups](@entry_id:184702)**. Classic examples include nitroaromatics, quinones, and polyhalogenated compounds  .

#### Deprotonation

Deprotonation, also known as proton abstraction, is an [ion-molecule reaction](@entry_id:750814) that produces an even-electron anion, commonly designated as $[\mathrm{M-H}]^-$. This pathway requires the analyte molecule, represented as $\mathrm{MH}$, to possess an acidic proton and to interact with a [reagent gas](@entry_id:754126)-phase base, $\mathrm{B}^-$.

$$
\mathrm{MH} + \mathrm{B}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{M}^{-} + \mathrm{BH}
$$

The thermodynamic driving force for this reaction is governed by the relative **gas-phase acidities** of the analyte and the conjugate acid of the reagent base. Gas-phase [acidity](@entry_id:137608), $\Delta G_{\text{acid}}$, is the Gibbs free energy change for the gas-phase dissociation $\mathrm{MH} \rightarrow \mathrm{M}^- + \mathrm{H}^+$. The proton transfer reaction is exergonic, and thus favorable, if the analyte $\mathrm{MH}$ is a stronger acid than $\mathrm{BH}$. This condition is met when $\Delta G_{\text{acid}}(\mathrm{MH})  \Delta G_{\text{acid}}(\mathrm{BH})$ . This is equivalent to stating that the reagent base $\mathrm{B}^-$ must be stronger than the analyte's conjugate base $\mathrm{M}^-$. Typical analytes susceptible to deprotonation include [carboxylic acids](@entry_id:747137), phenols, alcohols, and [sulfonamides](@entry_id:162895), when paired with a sufficiently strong reagent base like hydroxide ($\mathrm{HO}^-$) or [amide](@entry_id:184165) ($\mathrm{NH}_2^-$).

The [acidity](@entry_id:137608) of a molecule, and thus its suitability for this [ionization](@entry_id:136315) mechanism, is highly sensitive to its chemical structure. Substituent effects can be rationalized using principles of [physical organic chemistry](@entry_id:184637). For a series of related compounds, such as para-substituted benzoic acids, electron-withdrawing substituents stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base (the benzoate anion) through [inductive and resonance effects](@entry_id:750622). This stabilization increases the [acidity](@entry_id:137608) of the parent molecule (i.e., lowers its $\Delta G_{\text{acid}}$). A stronger [acidity](@entry_id:137608) leads to a more favorable equilibrium for deprotonation by a given base, resulting in a higher abundance of the $[\mathrm{M-H}]^-$ ion and a more intense signal in the mass spectrum. For example, when comparing benzoic acids with para-substituents like $\mathrm{NO_2}$, $\mathrm{CN}$, $\mathrm{CF_3}$, and $\mathrm{OCH_3}$, the nitro group ($\mathrm{NO_2}$) is the most strongly electron-withdrawing, as indicated by its large positive Hammett [substituent constant](@entry_id:198177) ($\sigma_p = 0.78$). It therefore imparts the highest gas-phase acidity to the molecule, leading to the most intense $[\mathrm{M-H}]^-$ signal under competitive deprotonation conditions .

#### Anion Attachment

Anion attachment is the association of a reagent anion, $\mathrm{X}^-$, with a neutral analyte molecule, $\mathrm{M}$, to form a stable adduct ion, $[\mathrm{M+X}]^-$.

$$
\mathrm{M} + \mathrm{X}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \left[\mathrm{M+X}\right]^{-}
$$

This pathway becomes significant under conditions where both [electron capture](@entry_id:158629) and deprotonation are inefficient. This occurs when the analyte has a low or negative electron affinity and lacks an acidic proton. The reaction is favored when the reagent anion, $\mathrm{X}^-$, is a relatively [weak base](@entry_id:156341) (such as $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ or $\mathrm{Br}^-$), as this minimizes the competing deprotonation channel. The stability of the resulting adduct is enhanced by strong electrostatic interactions, such as those involving analytes with large dipole moments or high polarizability (e.g., carbonyls, nitriles) .

Kinetically, anion attachment is an association reaction that initially forms an energetically excited complex. This complex must be collisionally stabilized by a third body (typically the high-pressure bath gas in the ion source) to dissipate its excess energy and prevent it from dissociating back to reactants. Therefore, anion attachment is most efficient in high-pressure ion sources and at modest temperatures, as the negative entropy of association makes the process less favorable at elevated temperatures .

### Ionization Techniques in Practice

The choice of mass spectrometry technique determines the specific chemical environment and energy regime, thereby selecting for one or more of the fundamental [ionization](@entry_id:136315) pathways.

#### Chemical and Atmospheric Pressure Ionization

In **Negative Ion Chemical Ionization (NICI)**, a [reagent gas](@entry_id:754126) is introduced into the ion source at relatively high pressure (~1 torr) and is ionized by a primary beam of high-energy electrons. This process creates a plasma rich in secondary species, including thermalized electrons and [reagent ions](@entry_id:754127), which then ionize the analyte molecules. The nature of the [reagent gas](@entry_id:754126) is paramount in determining the dominant ionization mechanism.
- Gases like methane or isobutane are effective at moderating the energy of primary electrons, producing a high population of thermal electrons. They do not readily form stable negative [reagent ions](@entry_id:754127) themselves. Under these conditions, [ionization](@entry_id:136315) occurs primarily via **Electron Capture (ECNI)**, making these gases ideal for analyzing compounds with high [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) .
- In contrast, a [reagent gas](@entry_id:754126) like ammonia ($\mathrm{NH}_3$) undergoes dissociative electron attachment to efficiently form the [amide](@entry_id:184165) anion ($\mathrm{NH}_2^-$), a very strong gas-phase base. This process simultaneously consumes thermal electrons and generates a high concentration of basic reagent [anions](@entry_id:166728). Consequently, with ammonia as the [reagent gas](@entry_id:754126), [ionization](@entry_id:136315) occurs predominantly via **deprotonation** for any analyte with a sufficiently acidic proton .

**Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI)** operates at [atmospheric pressure](@entry_id:147632). A [corona discharge](@entry_id:747892) generates primary electrons, which ionize the ambient air and solvent vapor. In negative mode, thermalized electrons are captured by molecules with a positive electron affinity. Molecular oxygen ($\mathrm{O}_2$), being abundant (21%) and having a positive EA (~$0.45\,\mathrm{eV}$), readily forms the superoxide radical anion, $\mathrm{O}_2^{-\bullet}$. Trace components with very high electron affinities, such as [nitrogen dioxide](@entry_id:149973) ($\mathrm{NO}_2$, $\mathrm{EA} \approx 2.3\,\mathrm{eV}$), are also extremely efficient electron scavengers, forming $\mathrm{NO}_2^-$. If chlorinated solvents are present, they can undergo dissociative electron attachment to yield chloride [anions](@entry_id:166728), $\mathrm{Cl}^-$. These species ($\mathrm{O}_2^{-\bullet}$, $\mathrm{NO}_2^-$, $\mathrm{Cl}^-$, and their hydrates) constitute the primary [reagent ions](@entry_id:754127) that subsequently ionize the analyte, typically by deprotonation or anion attachment .

#### Electrospray Ionization (ESI)

**Negative-mode Electrospray Ionization (ESI(-))** is fundamentally different as it is a solution-phase technique that transfers ions pre-formed in solution into the gas phase. A high negative potential is applied to a capillary, dispersing the analyte solution into a fine spray of negatively charged droplets. As the solvent evaporates, the droplets shrink, and their [charge density](@entry_id:144672) increases. Two principal models describe the ultimate formation of gas-phase ions:
1.  **In-droplet Deprotonation:** For an acidic analyte, deprotonation occurs in the liquid phase, governed by its solution-phase [acidity](@entry_id:137608) ($\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$) and the solution pH. In a basic or even neutral mobile phase, [strong acids](@entry_id:202580) (e.g., sulfonic acids, [carboxylic acids](@entry_id:747137)) will be largely present as their [conjugate base](@entry_id:144252) anions. As the droplet shrinks, the effective pH can increase dramatically, enabling the deprotonation of even weaker acids. Eventually, the droplet evaporates completely, leaving the deprotonated analyte anion, $[\mathrm{M-H}]^-$, as a charged residue in the gas phase. This mechanism is primarily governed by [acid-base chemistry](@entry_id:138706) .
2.  **Ion Evaporation:** For small, mobile ions that are pre-existing in the solution (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ from a salt), a different mechanism can dominate. As the droplet shrinks, the electrostatic repulsion of the charges on its surface eventually becomes strong enough to overcome the surface tension. The immense electric field at the droplet surface (which can approach $10^9\,\mathrm{V\,m^{-1}}$ near the Rayleigh stability limit) can directly eject these small ions into the gas phase . This field-assisted process is favored by high solution conductivity, which increases the charge on the droplets.

The complementary nature of ESI and ECNI is a powerful tool in [analytical chemistry](@entry_id:137599). For a mixture containing a strong acid (like phenylsulfonic acid, $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} = 0.7$) and a non-acidic molecule with high [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) (like nitrobenzene, $\mathrm{EA} = 0.97\,\mathrm{eV}$), ESI(-) will selectively ionize the acid, producing an abundant $[\mathrm{M-H}]^-$ signal, while being insensitive to the nitrobenzene. Conversely, ECNI will selectively ionize the nitrobenzene, yielding a strong $M^{-\bullet}$ signal, while being insensitive to the acid .

### Stability and Fragmentation of Negative Ions

Tandem [mass spectrometry](@entry_id:147216) (MS/MS) via Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) is used to structurally characterize ions. The [fragmentation patterns](@entry_id:201894) of negative ions are profoundly influenced by their electronic structure, particularly the distinction between even-electron and [odd-electron species](@entry_id:143485).

#### Formation and Stability of Radical Anions

The [initial stability](@entry_id:181141) of a radical anion $M^{-\bullet}$ formed by [electron capture](@entry_id:158629) is a critical kinetic factor. This process is governed by the Franck-Condon principle: the [electron capture](@entry_id:158629) is an electronic transition that occurs much faster than [nuclear motion](@entry_id:185492). Therefore, the anion is initially formed with the same geometry as the neutral molecule. This leads to the distinction between two types of [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) :
- The **Adiabatic Electron Affinity (AEA)** is the energy difference between the ground vibrational state of the neutral and the ground vibrational state of the anion (i.e., between their respective equilibrium geometries). It represents the overall [thermodynamic stability](@entry_id:142877) of the anion. $\mathrm{AEA} = E_{\mathrm{N}}(Q_{\mathrm{N}}) - E_{\mathrm{A}}(Q_{\mathrm{A}})$.
- The **Vertical Electron Affinity (VEA)** is the energy difference between the ground state of the neutral and the anion at the neutral's equilibrium geometry. It reflects the stability of the anion at the instant of its formation. $\mathrm{VEA} = E_{\mathrm{N}}(Q_{\mathrm{N}}) - E_{\mathrm{A}}(Q_{\mathrm{N}})$.

For a stable anion, it must be that $\mathrm{AEA} \ge \mathrm{VEA}$. The difference, $\Delta = \mathrm{AEA} - \mathrm{VEA}$, represents the reorganization energy that is deposited as vibrational energy into the nascent anion as it relaxes to its own equilibrium geometry. This vibrationally excited anion can either be stabilized through collisions with a bath gas or lose the electron via **autodetachment**. A small VEA, even if the AEA is large, implies that the anion is only weakly bound at its moment of formation and is highly susceptible to autodetachment. This kinetic bottleneck can severely reduce the observed ion intensity. For example, of two [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons](@entry_id:194624) with the same AEA ($0.55\,\mathrm{eV}$), the one with a much larger VEA ($0.52\,\mathrm{eV}$ vs $0.10\,\mathrm{eV}$) will exhibit a significantly higher $M^{-\bullet}$ intensity because the nascent anion is more stable and has a higher probability of surviving long enough to be collisionally cooled .

#### Fragmentation and the Even-Electron Rule

The fragmentation pathways observed in CID are governed by the **[even-electron rule](@entry_id:749118)**, which is based on the [relative stability](@entry_id:262615) of even-electron (closed-shell) versus odd-electron (radical) species. This rule applies robustly to negative ions .

- **Even-Electron (EE) Ions:** Species like $[\mathrm{M-H}]^-$ are closed-shell and relatively stable. They strongly prefer to fragment by losing stable, neutral, even-electron molecules (e.g., $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{ketene}$). This preserves the stable even-electron nature of the ion. For example, the EE anion of *o*-nitrobenzoic acid, $[\mathrm{M-H}]^-$, fragments via loss of the EE neutral $\mathrm{CO_2}$ . Loss of a radical from an EE ion is a high-energy, disfavored process.

- **Odd-Electron (OE) Ions:** Radical anions like $M^{-\bullet}$ are inherently more reactive. In addition to losing EE neutrals, they have access to a characteristic, often low-energy, fragmentation channel: the loss of a neutral radical. This process, typically a homolytic bond cleavage, results in the formation of a stable, even-electron product anion. For instance, the OE radical anion of nitrobenzene fragments via homolytic cleavage of the C–N bond to lose the OE radical $\mathrm{NO_2}^{\bullet}$, forming the stable EE phenyl anion, $\mathrm{C_6H_5}^-$ .

Because of this stark difference, the observation of a fragment ion corresponding to the **loss of a neutral radical** is a powerful diagnostic feature in an MS/MS spectrum, providing strong evidence that the precursor ion was an [odd-electron species](@entry_id:143485), i.e., a radical anion $M^{-\bullet}$  .

#### Kinetic Competition in Radical Anion Fragmentation

When a radical anion is activated by CID, bond cleavage is not the only possible outcome. **Electron detachment** is a ubiquitous competing unimolecular channel.
$$
\mathrm{M}^{-\bullet} \rightarrow \mathrm{M}^{\bullet} + e^{-}
$$
The [threshold energy](@entry_id:271447) for this process is simply the [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) (EA) of the neutral radical $\mathrm{M}^{\bullet}$. The outcome of the CID experiment depends on the kinetic competition between bond cleavage and electron detachment. According to statistical rate theories (like RRKM theory), the rate of a [unimolecular reaction](@entry_id:143456) is a steep function of the excess energy available above its threshold, $(E - E_0)$.

Consider a radical anion where the threshold for a homolytic bond cleavage ($0.95\,\mathrm{eV}$) is lower than the threshold for electron detachment ($1.20\,\mathrm{eV}$). If the ion is activated with an internal energy of $1.40\,\mathrm{eV}$, both channels are open. However, the excess energy available to the bond cleavage channel ($1.40 - 0.95 = 0.45\,\mathrm{eV}$) is more than double that available to the detachment channel ($1.40 - 1.20 = 0.20\,\mathrm{eV}$). This larger energy deposition in the cleavage channel's vibrational modes causes its rate to increase far more dramatically than the detachment rate, making it the dominant fragmentation pathway, even if the pre-exponential factor for detachment is slightly larger . This highlights that fragmentation of negative ions is a nuanced process where the lowest-energy pathway is often, but not always, the one that dominates, with the outcome being a sensitive function of the internal energy and the specific activation energies of all competing channels.
