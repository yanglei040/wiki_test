This allows for a unique qualitative analysis of the reaction dynamics and temperature dependence.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem statement uses precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It presents energies and reaction conditions without subjective interpretation.\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe reaction follows a two-step mechanism involving a pre-reaction complex, as dictated by the double-well potential energy surface:\n$$ \\mathrm{F^- + CH_3Cl} \\quad \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_c}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\quad [\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]^* \\quad \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} \\quad \\mathrm{CH_3F + Cl^-} $$\nHere, $k_c$ is the bimolecular rate constant for the capture of reactants to form an energized intermediate complex, $[\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]^*$. This complex can either redissociate back to reactants with a unimolecular rate constant $k_{-1}$ or proceed over the central barrier to form products with a unimolecular rate constant $k_2$.\n\nThe condition of \"negligible collisional stabilization\" means the energized complex $[\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]^*$ is not deactivated by collisions with a third body. It is a transient species, and we can apply the steady-state approximation to its concentration:\n$$ \\frac{d\\left[[\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]^*\\right]}{dt} = k_c[\\mathrm{F^-}][\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}] - k_{-1}[[\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]^*] - k_2[[\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]^*] \\approx 0 $$\nSolving for the concentration of the complex:\n$$ [[\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]^*] = \\frac{k_c[\\mathrm{F^-}][\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}]}{k_{-1} + k_2} $$\nThe overall rate of product formation is given by $v = k_2[[\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]^*]$. Substituting the expression for the complex concentration, we find the overall rate law is $v = k_{overall}[\\mathrm{F^-}][\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}]$, where the overall bimolecular rate constant $k_{overall}$ is:\n$$ k_{overall} = k_c \\left( \\frac{k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\right) $$\nThis expression shows that the overall rate constant is the product of the capture rate constant ($k_c$) and the reaction efficiency ($\\Phi = \\frac{k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}$), which is the fraction of complexes that proceed to products.\n\nLet's analyze the components based on the given energy landscape:\n- Reactants $\\mathrm{F^- + CH_3Cl}$ are at a relative energy of $E = 0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- The intermediate complex $[\\mathrm{F^- \\cdots CH_3Cl}]$ is in a potential well with a minimum at $E = -40\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- The central transition state (TS) for substitution is at a maximum at $E = +10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nThe crucial feature is that the central barrier is located at an energy of $+10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, which is **above** the energy of the separated reactants. For the overall reaction to occur, the colliding reactants must possess at least $10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ of relative energy to begin with, in order to have sufficient total energy to surmount the central barrier. This is the minimum energy threshold for the reaction.\n\nThe formation of the complex is governed by $k_c$. According to ion-molecule capture theories, for a polar molecule like $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$, $k_c$ will have a weak negative temperature dependence (e.g., $k_c \\propto T^{-1/2}$ according to Average Dipole Orientation theory). It will not increase with temperature.\n\nThe competition between redissociation ($k_{-1}$) and reaction ($k_2$) is described by RRKM theory. The complex is formed with an internal energy equal to the collision energy plus the well depth.\n- The energy barrier for redissociation, measured from the bottom of the well, is $E_a(-1) = 0 - (-40) = 40\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- The energy barrier for reaction, measured from the bottom of the well, is $E_a(2) = +10 - (-40) = 50\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nAlthough the complex provides a temporary \"trap\" for the reactants, allowing for energy redistribution which facilitates eventual barrier crossing (a key concept in RRKM theory), the overall reaction is still energetically demanding. The system must have an initial total energy of at least $+10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. According to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of translational energies, the fraction of collisions with energy greater than this threshold ($E_{threshold} = 10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) increases exponentially with temperature.\n\nTherefore:\n1.  The reaction will proceed, provided the temperature is high enough for a significant fraction of reactant pairs to have $\\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ of collision energy. A barrier of $10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ is surmountable at typical \"thermal\" conditions (e.g., room temperature, where $RT \\approx 2.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$).\n2.  The temperature dependence of the overall rate constant, $k_{overall}$, will be dominated by the requirement to overcome this positive energy barrier. This results in a positive apparent activation energy, and the rate constant will increase with temperature, following a behavior that is approximately Arrhenius-like ($k \\propto e^{-E_a/RT}$, where $E_a$ is related to the $10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ barrier).\n3.  At very low temperatures, where $k_B T \\ll 10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, the fraction of collisions exceeding the threshold energy will be extremely small, and the reaction will be strongly suppressed.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The substitution will not occur at any reasonable temperature because a central barrier above the reactants prevents gas-phase $\\mathrm{S_N2}$; complex formation does not assist barrier crossing, and the rate decreases with temperature.**\n- This is incorrect. A barrier of $+10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ is readily overcome at moderate temperatures. Complex formation is precisely the mechanism that facilitates barrier crossing in the gas phase by allowing for energy randomization (an RRKM effect). The rate will increase, not decrease, with temperature due to the positive barrier.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The substitution will proceed via a pre-reaction complex, but the central barrier being above the reactants imposes a positive apparent activation energy; the bimolecular rate constant increases with temperature approximately according to an Arrhenius-type dependence, while at very low temperature the reaction is strongly suppressed due to insufficient energy to surmount the barrier.**\n- This statement accurately describes the situation. The reaction proceeds through the complex. The $+10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ barrier relative to reactants is the energetic bottleneck, leading to a positive activation energy. Consequently, the rate increases with temperature in an Arrhenius-like fashion and is negligible at very low temperatures.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The $-40\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ entrance complex implies a negative activation energy, so the rate decreases with increasing temperature and the reaction is capture-limited and essentially temperature independent.**\n- This is incorrect. A negative activation energy would arise if the rate-limiting transition state were *below* the reactant energy level. Here, it is above. The deep well is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a negative activation energy. The rate will increase with temperature. The reaction is not capture-limited ($\\Phi  1$) because there is a significant barrier to product formation ($k_2$) relative to redissociation ($k_{-1}$), and more importantly, there is an overall energy requirement.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because the ion–induced dipole capture step dominates, the overall rate constant is independent of temperature and equal to the Langevin capture limit across temperatures.**\n- This is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, for a polar molecule like $\\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$, the ion-permanent dipole interaction is critical, so the simple temperature-independent Langevin model (ion-induced dipole only) is not appropriate. Second, and more importantly, the overall rate constant depends on the reaction efficiency, which is much less than $1$ and is strongly temperature-dependent due to the $+10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ central barrier. The rate is thus not equal to the capture limit and is not independent of temperature.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The reaction proceeds if $\\mathrm{HA_x}$ is a stronger acid than $\\mathrm{HA_r}$, i.e., $GA(\\mathrm{HA_x})  GA(\\mathrm{HA_r})$.\n\nThe primary experimental difficulty is the formation of the encounter complex, which can be collisionally stabilized into an adduct $\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}$ rather than proceeding to the proton transfer products $\\mathrm{A_x^-} + \\mathrm{HA_r}$ or reverting to reactants $\\mathrm{A_r^-} + \\mathrm{HA_x}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{A_r^-} + \\mathrm{HA_x} \\rightleftharpoons [\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}]^* \\rightarrow \\mathrm{A_x^-} + \\mathrm{HA_r} $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}]^* + \\mathrm{M} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x} + \\mathrm{M} $$\nHere, $\\mathrm{M}$ is a third body, such as a buffer gas atom. The formation of the stabilized adduct $\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}$ is a competing process that does not directly indicate whether proton transfer is exo- or endergonic. Its formation simply indicates an attractive interaction between the ion and the neutral molecule. This process is enhanced at higher pressures where the collision frequency with the third body $\\mathrm{M}$ is higher.\n\nTherefore, the best experimental design must:\n1.  Minimize collisional stabilization of adducts to study the intrinsic reaction dynamics. This favors low-pressure conditions.\n2.  If adducts still form, employ a method to remove them or distinguish their formation from true proton transfer.\n\nAn FT-ICR mass spectrometer operating at ultra-high vacuum (UHV, e.g., $p  10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{mbar}$) is the ideal instrument because the low pressure drastically reduces the rate of third-body collisions, thus minimizing the formation of stabilized adducts. In contrast, a Quadrupole Ion Trap (QIT) requires a buffer gas (e.g., He at $\\sim 1\\ \\mathrm{mTorr} \\approx 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mbar}$) for ion trapping and cooling, making collisional stabilization of adducts much more probable.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Isolate $\\mathrm{A_{r}^-}$ ions in a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) cell at ultra-high vacuum ($p  10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mbar}$) and room temperature, pulse in $\\mathrm{HA_x}$ neutrals to a number density $n \\approx 2.4 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ for $t = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{s}$, and record product formation of $\\mathrm{A_x^-}$ versus unchanged $\\mathrm{A_r^-}$ for $\\mathrm{A_{r1}^-}$, $\\mathrm{A_{r2}^-}$, and $\\mathrm{A_{r3}^-}$. Apply a brief, low-amplitude dipolar excitation after the reaction to collisionally remove any residual $\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}$ adducts without substantially altering the equilibrium products, and reject conditions that yield more than $5\\%$ adduct signal. If proton transfer is observed with $\\mathrm{A_{r3}^-}$ but not with $\\mathrm{A_{r2}^-}$, report the bracket $1380\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}  GA(\\mathrm{HA_x})  1390\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\n\nThis option describes an excellent experimental design.\n1.  **Instrument and Conditions**: Using an FT-ICR at UHV ($p10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{mbar}$) is the correct choice to minimize unwanted collisional stabilization of adducts.\n2.  **Adduct Control**: The design incorporates a two-level strategy for dealing with adducts. First, it minimizes their formation by using UHV. Second, it proposes an active removal step using low-amplitude dipolar excitation (a form of low-energy collision-induced dissociation, CID) to gently break apart any weakly bound adducts that may still form, without affecting the products of the chemical reaction. This is a sophisticated and correct approach.\n3.  **Interpretation Logic**: The interpretation of the hypothetical result is now logically sound. Observing proton transfer with $\\mathrm{A_{r3}^-}$ implies $GA(\\mathrm{HA_x})  GA(\\mathrm{HA_{r3}}) = 1390\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Not observing it with $\\mathrm{A_{r2}^-}$ implies $GA(\\mathrm{HA_x}) \\ge GA(\\mathrm{HA_{r2}}) = 1380\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Together, these correctly establish the bracket. The experimental methodology is state-of-the-art for this type of measurement.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Isolate $\\mathrm{A_{r}^-}$ in a Quadrupole Ion Trap (QIT) with helium buffer gas at $p = 1\\ \\mathrm{mTorr}$, leak in $\\mathrm{HA_x}$ to $n \\approx 1 \\times 10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ for $t = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{s}$, and treat any observed $\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}$ adduct as equivalent evidence of exergonic proton transfer. Use the presence or absence of either $\\mathrm{A_x^-}$ or $\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}$ to set the bracket.**\n\nThis option uses a QIT, which operates at relatively high pressure ($\\sim 1\\ \\mathrm{mTorr}$) where collisional stabilization is significant. The main flaw is the proposal to \"treat any observed $\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}$ adduct as equivalent evidence of exergonic proton transfer.\" This is fundamentally incorrect. Adducts can form regardless of whether the subsequent proton transfer is thermochemically favorable or not. Their formation is driven by ion-neutral electrostatic attractions. Equating adduct formation with successful proton transfer would lead to a grossly inaccurate measurement, likely underestimating the true $GA$ value.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Prepare protonated reference acids $\\mathrm{HA_rH^+}$ instead of deprotonated reference acids and evaluate the reaction $\\mathrm{HA_rH^+} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{HA_r} + \\mathrm{BH^+}$ with $\\mathrm{B}$ the unknown analyte base sites. Use the resulting thresholds to bracket $GA(\\mathrm{HA_x})$.**\n\nThis option describes an experiment to measure gas-phase basicity ($GB$) or proton affinity ($PA$) of an analyte base $\\mathrm{B}$, not the gas-phase acidity ($GA$) of an analyte acid $\\mathrm{HA_x}$. The reaction probes the ability of $\\mathrm{B}$ to accept a proton relative to $\\mathrm{HA_r}$. The problem requires characterizing the acid $\\mathrm{HA_x}$ by its ability to *donate* a proton. This option proposes the wrong type of experiment for the stated analytical goal.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Operate the FT-ICR cell with argon buffer gas at $p = 1\\ \\mathrm{mTorr}$ to maximize collisional cooling, introduce $\\mathrm{HA_x}$ at $n \\approx 5 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ for $t = 1\\ \\mathrm{s}$ to drive reactions toward completion, and interpret the formation of stabilized $\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}$ complexes as indicative of near-threshold proton transfer. Use those complexes to set the bracket.**\n\nThis design is flawed. While an FT-ICR *can* be operated at higher pressures with a pulsed-in buffer gas, doing so intentionally at $p = 1\\ \\mathrm{mTorr}$ with an efficient collider like argon would maximize the rate of collisional stabilization of adducts. This exacerbates the very problem the experiment should seek to avoid. The interpretation that adduct formation is \"indicative of near-threshold proton transfer\" is incorrect for the same reason as in option B. Stable adducts can form even when proton transfer is highly endergonic. This method does not properly control for the confounding artifact.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Intentionally hydrate the deprotonated reference acid ions to form $\\mathrm{A_r^-(H_2O)_n}$ clusters prior to reaction on a QIT, so that competitive hydration reduces direct $\\mathrm{A_r^- \\cdot HA_x}$ clustering. Accept hydrated complexes and mixed adducts as non-biasing and use $\\mathrm{A_x^-}$ yield thresholds to bracket $GA(\\mathrm{HA_x})$.**\n\nThis experimental design is flawed because it does not measure the intrinsic gas-phase acidity. The presence of water molecules solvating the anion changes its reactivity and the overall thermochemistry of the reaction. The experiment would measure a \"micro-solvated\" acidity, which is different from the unsolvated, intrinsic $GA(\\mathrm{HA_x})$ defined in the problem. The claim that this is \"non-biasing\" is false; it biases the measurement away from the target property. While techniques using clustered ions exist (e.g., Cooks' kinetic method), they are used to determine properties like relative ligand binding affinities, not to get an unbiased measure of the intrinsic $GA$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Option A describes the most rigorous and appropriate experimental design for the stated purpose. The core methodology—using UHV FT-ICR to prevent adduct formation and low-energy CID to remove any that form—is the correct way to control for the specified experimental artifact. All other options propose fundamentally flawed procedures.",
