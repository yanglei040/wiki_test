This exercise demonstrates the essential first step in data analysis: converting the raw mass shift observed in the spectrometer into the average number of deuterons, $n(t)$, incorporated into the peptide population. Mastering this straightforward calculation is the gateway to exploring the kinetics and structural dynamics hidden within the data. ",

            "problem": "Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) monitors the incorporation of deuterium atoms into exchangeable hydrogen sites of a peptide, with each successful exchange increasing the peptide’s mass by the difference between the deuterium and protium atomic masses. Assume the unified atomic mass unit equals the Dalton. Consider a peptide with an initial monoisotopic mass of $1500.0000$ Da. When exposed to deuterated solvent, the observed centroid masses at times $t = 10$ s and $t = 100$ s are $1503.0188$ Da and $1505.0310$ Da, respectively. Assume that only hydrogen-to-deuterium exchanges contribute to the mass increase and that no other chemical modifications occur. Use the standard atomic masses $m_{\\!^{1}\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007825$ Da and $m_{\\!^{2}\\mathrm{H}} = 2.014102$ Da.

Provide the counts as integers, and express the fractional occupancies as decimals rounded to four significant figures. No percentage signs are permitted.",
            "solution": "The analysis proceeds from the fundamental principle of mass conservation as applied to hydrogen-deuterium exchange in mass spectrometry. The total mass of the peptide at any time is the sum of its initial mass and the cumulative mass increase from the incorporation of deuterium atoms.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the mass change associated with a single hydrogen-to-deuterium exchange event. This change, denoted by $\\Delta m$, is the difference between the atomic mass of a deuterium atom ($^{2}\\mathrm{H}$), $m_{\\!^{2}\\mathrm{H}}$, and the atomic mass of a protium atom ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$), $m_{\\!^{1}\\mathrm{H}}$. The problem provides these standard atomic mass values:\n$$ m_{\\!^{1}\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007825 \\text{ Da} $$\n$$ m_{\\!^{2}\\mathrm{H}} = 2.014102 \\text{ Da} $$\nThe mass increase per exchange is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta m = m_{\\!^{2}\\mathrm{H}} - m_{\\!^{1}\\mathrm{H}} = 2.014102 - 1.007825 = 1.006277 \\text{ Da} $$\n\nThe observed centroid mass of the peptide population at a given time $t$, denoted $M(t)$, is related to the initial monoisotopic mass, $M_0$, and the average number of incorporated deuterons, $n(t)$, by the following equation:\n$$ M(t) = M_0 + n(t) \\cdot \\Delta m $$\nFrom this relationship, we can solve for $n(t)$, which represents the average number of deuterium atoms incorporated per peptide molecule at time $t$:\n$$ n(t) = \\frac{M(t) - M_0}{\\Delta m} $$\n\nThe problem provides the initial peptide mass $M_0 = 1500.0000 \\text{ Da}$. We can now calculate $n(t)$ for the two specified time points.\n\nAt time $t = 10 \\text{ s}$, the observed centroid mass is $M(10) = 1503.0188 \\text{ Da}$. The total mass increase, $\\Delta M(10)$, is:\n$$ \\Delta M(10) = M(10) - M_0 = 1503.0188 - 1500.0000 = 3.0188 \\text{ Da} $$\nThe average number of incorporated deuterons at this time is:\n$$ n(10) = \\frac{\\Delta M(10)}{\\Delta m} = \\frac{3.0188}{1.006277} \\approx 2.9998 $$\nThe problem requires this count as an integer. Rounding the calculated average to the nearest whole number gives:\n$$ n(10) \\approx 3 $$\n\nAt time $t = 100 \\text{ s}$, the observed centroid mass is $M(100) = 1505.0310 \\text{ Da}$. The total mass increase, $\\Delta M(100)$, is:\n$$ \\Delta M(100) = M(100) - M_0 = 1505.0310 - 1500.0000 = 5.0310 \\text{ Da} $$\nThe average number of incorporated deuterons at this time is:\n$$ n(100) = \\frac{\\Delta M(100)}{\\Delta m} = \\frac{5.0310}{1.006277} \\approx 4.9996 $$\nRounding this value to the nearest integer gives:\n$$ n(100) \\approx 5 $$\n\nNext, we determine the fractional occupancy of exchangeable sites, $f(t)$, defined as the ratio of the number of incorporated deuterons, $n(t)$, to the maximum possible number of exchangeable sites, $N_{\\max}$. The problem states $N_{\\max} = 10$.\n$$ f(t) = \\frac{n(t)}{N_{\\max}} $$\n\nUsing the integer values for $n(t)$ as determined above, we calculate the fractional occupancies.\n\nFor $t = 10 \\text{ s}$:\n$$ f(10) = \\frac{n(10)}{N_{\\max}} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, which is $0.3000$.\n\nFor $t = 100 \\text{ s}$:\n$$ f(100) = \\frac{n(100)}{N_{\\max}} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 $$\nExpressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.5000$.\n\nIn summary, the number of incorporated deuterons at $10 \\text{ s}$ and $100 \\text{ s}$ are $3$ and $5$, respectively.

            "introduction": "In an ideal experiment, every deuterium atom incorporated during labeling would be retained for measurement.

            "problem": "A peptide segment from a protein is analyzed by Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS). The experiment uses Electrospray Ionization (ESI) into a high-resolution Orbitrap analyzer, and all signals are recorded for the same charge state, so response factors for the two observed envelopes can be assumed equal. At labeling times of $10$ s, $100$ s, and $1000$ s in $D_2O$, the isotope distributions of the peptide show a persistent bimodal pattern: two well-resolved envelopes centered at mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) positions consistent with $+3$ and $+9$ deuterium incorporations (for $z=1$), with no detectable centroid drift over time. The mass addition per exchanged site is approximately $\\Delta m = m_{\\mathrm{D}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}} \\approx 1.0063$ Da. The monoisotopic neutral mass of the undeuterated peptide is $m_0 = 1483.650$ Da, and the observed centroids remain at $m_1 = m_0 + 3\\Delta m$ and $m_2 = m_0 + 9\\Delta m$ for all labeling times.\n\nFor each time point, the integrated intensities (areas under the envelopes) are measured as follows:\n- At $10$ s: low-uptake envelope area $A_{\\ell}(10) = 7.5 \\times 10^5$ counts; high-uptake envelope area $A_{h}(10) = 5.0 \\times 10^5$ counts.\n- At $100$ s: $A_{\\ell}(100) = 7.4 \\times 10^5$ counts; $A_{h}(100) = 4.9 \\times 10^5$ counts.\n- At $1000$ s: $A_{\\ell}(1000) = 7.3 \\times 10^5$ counts; $A_{h}(1000) = 4.8 \\times 10^5$ counts.\n\nAssume quench and analysis conditions minimize back-exchange equally for both envelopes and that ionization efficiency is the same for both populations at the recorded charge state. Starting from fundamental HDX-MS principles that connect deuterium incorporation to mass shifts and interpreting mixtures as linear superpositions of component probability distributions, infer the mechanistic origin of the persistent bimodality and estimate the fractions of the two underlying states in solution at the onset of labeling.\n\nWhich option best matches the correct mechanistic inference and the quantitative fraction estimates?\n\nA. The peptide exists as two non-interconverting conformational states on the HDX labeling timescale; the fraction of the low-uptake state is $f_{\\ell} \\approx 0.60$ and the high-uptake state is $f_{h} \\approx 0.40$.\n\nB. The peptide undergoes global EX1 kinetics (cooperative opening) in which the low-uptake population converts to the high-uptake population over time; the fractions therefore vary with time and cannot be considered constant, so $f_{\\ell} = f_{h} = 0.50$ is the best estimate.\n\nC. The bimodality is an artifact of overlapping charge states or isotopic fine structure; the correct fractions are given by the ratio of centroid separations, yielding $f_{\\ell} = 3/12 \\approx 0.25$ and $f_{h} = 9/12 \\approx 0.75$.\n\nD. Two non-interconverting states are present, but unequal instrument response between envelopes makes areas unreliable; the most plausible fractions reverse the apparent areas, with $f_{\\ell} \\approx 0.40$ and $f_{h} \\approx 0.60$.\n\nE. The states interconvert on the labeling timescale, but their centroid positions are held fixed by exact cancellation from back-exchange; because of this, the fractions evolve yet appear constant, and the best estimate is a time-dependent $f_{\\ell}(t)$ decreasing from $0.60$ toward $0.40$ and $f_{h}(t)$ increasing correspondingly.",

A bimodal distribution indicates either EX1 kinetics (interconversion) or static heterogeneity (non-interconverting states).\n\n1.  **Calculate Relative Fractions**: The fraction of each population can be calculated from the integrated area of its corresponding isotopic envelope, assuming equal response factors as stated in the problem.
