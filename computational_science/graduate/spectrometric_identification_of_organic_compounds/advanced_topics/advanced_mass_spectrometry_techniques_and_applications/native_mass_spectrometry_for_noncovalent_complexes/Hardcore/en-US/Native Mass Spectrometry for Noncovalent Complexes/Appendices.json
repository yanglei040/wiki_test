            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The total mass of an ion carrying $z$ protons is $M + z\\,m_p$, where $M$ is the neutral mass of the complex and $m_p$ is the mass of a proton.\n- The net charge of the ion is $+z$.\n- The measured mass-to-charge ratio is defined as $m/z = \\frac{\\text{Total Mass}}{\\text{Charge}}$.\n- Two adjacent peaks are observed at $m/z_1$ and $m/z_2$.\n- The peak at $m/z_1 = 12501.007276$ corresponds to charge state $z$.\n- The peak at $m/z_2 = 13637.37091236$ corresponds to charge state $z-1$.\n- The proton mass is given as $m_p = 1.007276$ Da.\n- It is assumed that only protons contribute to the ion mass.\n- Three tasks are requested:\n  1.

Express $M$ in kilodaltons (kDa) and round to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem description accurately reflects the fundamental principles of Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS). The formulas for calculating the mass-to-charge ratio of a protonated species and the method for determining charge state and mass from a series of adjacent peaks are standard procedures in mass spectrometry data analysis. The problem is scientifically valid.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides two distinct measurements ($m/z_1$ and $m/z_2$) corresponding to two related charge states ($z$ and $z-1$). This gives rise to a system of two equations with two unknowns ($M$ and $z$), which is solvable for a unique solution. The data are sufficient and internally consistent.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, unambiguous technical language. All values are given to a high degree of precision, as is typical for high-resolution mass spectrometry data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be developed.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the expression for z**\n\nFrom the definition provided, the mass-to-charge ratio for the two observed peaks can be expressed as follows:\nFor the peak at $m/z_1$ with charge state $z$:\n$$m/z_1 = \\frac{M + z m_p}{z} \\quad (1)$$\n\nFor the peak at $m/z_2$ with charge state $z-1$:\n$$m/z_2 = \\frac{M + (z-1) m_p}{z-1} \\quad (2)$$\n\nTo find an expression for $z$, we must eliminate the neutral mass $M$. We begin by rearranging both equations to solve for $M$.\nFrom equation ($1$):\n$$z (m/z_1) = M + z m_p$$\n$$M = z (m/z_1) - z m_p = z(m/z_1 - m_p)$$\n\nFrom equation ($2$):\n$$(z-1)(m/z_2) = M + (z-1) m_p$$\n$$M = (z-1)(m/z_2) - (z-1) m_p = (z-1)(m/z_2 - m_p)$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $M$, we obtain:\n$$z(m/z_1 - m_p) = (z-1)(m/z_2 - m_p)$$\n\nWe expand this equation to solve for $z$:\n$$z(m/z_1) - z m_p = z(m/z_2) - (m/z_2) - z m_p + m_p$$\n\nThe term $-z m_p$ cancels from both sides:\n$$z(m/z_1) = z(m/z_2) - (m/z_2) + m_p$$\n\nNext, we collect all terms involving $z$ on one side of the equation:\n$$(m/z_2) - m_p = z(m/z_2) - z(m/z_1)$$\n$$(m/z_2) - m_p = z((m/z_2) - (m/z_1))$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $z$ to arrive at the explicit expression:\n$$z = \\frac{(m/z_2) - m_p}{(m/z_2) - (m/z_1)}$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of z and M**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula for $z$.\n- $m/z_1 = 12501.007276$\n- $m/z_2 = 13637.37091236$\n- $m_p = 1.007276$\n\nFirst, we compute the numerator:\n$$(m/z_2) - m_p = 13637.37091236 - 1.007276 = 13636.36363636$$\n\nNext, we compute the denominator:\n$$(m/z_2) - (m/z_1) = 13637.37091236 - 12501.007276 = 1136.36363636$$\n\nNow, we calculate $z$:\n$$z = \\frac{13636.36363636}{1136.36363636} = 12$$\n\nThe charge state $z$ is an integer, $12$, which is a physically consistent result. The two peaks correspond to charge states $z=12$ and $z-1=11$.\n\nWith the value of $z$, we can now calculate the neutral mass $M$ using the rearranged form of equation ($1$):\n$$M = z(m/z_1 - m_p)$$\n$$M = 12 \\times (12501.007276 - 1.007276)$$\n$$M = 12 \\times 12500.000000$$\n$$M = 150000.000000 \\text{ Da}$$\n\nWe can verify this result using the expression from equation ($2$):\n$$M = (z-1)(m/z_2 - m_p)$$\n$$M = (12-1) \\times (13637.37091236 - 1.007276)$$\n$$M = 11 \\times 13636.36363636$$\nKnowing that the repeating decimal $0.3636\\dots$ is the fraction $\\frac{4}{11}$, we have:\n$$M = 11 \\times \\left(13636 + \\frac{4}{11}\\right) = (11 \\times 13636) + \\left(11 \\times \\frac{4}{11}\\right) = 149996 + 4 = 150000 \\text{ Da}$$\nBoth calculations yield the same result, confirming that the neutral mass of the assembly is $150000$ Da.\n\n**Part 3: Final reporting of M**\n\nThe problem requires the mass to be reported in kilodaltons (kDa) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$1 \\text{ kDa} = 1000 \\text{ Da}$$\n$$M (\\text{kDa}) = \\frac{150000 \\text{ Da}}{1000 \\text{ Da/kDa}} = 150.0 \\text{ kDa}$$\nThe value $150.0$ has four significant figures. The trailing zero after the decimal point is significant and indicates the precision. No further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answers are the charge state $z=12$ and the neutral mass $M=150.0$ kDa.",

To assign a given peak with a measured $m/z$ to a species of mass $M$, we must find an integer charge state $z$ that satisfies this equation.

We will test each of the five observed peaks against both masses, $M_1$ and $M_2$, to find which combinations yield integer values for $z$.\n\n**Peak 1: $m/z = 3871.98$**\n-   For $M_1 = 100,000\\,\\mathrm{Da}$: $z = \\frac{100000}{3871.98 - 1.0073} = \\frac{100000}{3870.9727} \\approx 25.83$.

This is an excellent fit for $z=31$.\n-   **Assignment:** Peak $3871.98$ belongs to species $M_2$ with charge state $z=31$.\n\n**Peak 2: $m/z = 4001.01$**\n-   For $M_1 = 100,000\\,\\mathrm{Da}$: $z = \\frac{100000}{4001.01 - 1.0073} = \\frac{100000}{4000.0027} \\approx 25.000$. This is an excellent fit for $z=25$.\n-   For $M_2 = 120,000\\,\\mathrm{Da}$: $z = \\frac{120000}{4001.01 - 1.0073} = \\frac{120000}{4000.0027} \\approx 30.000$. This is an excellent fit for $z=30$.\n-   **Assignment:** Peak $4001.01$ represents an overlap of species $M_1$ with $z=25$ and species $M_2$ with $z=30$. This explains its high intensity ($I=1.0$).\n\n**Peak 3: $m/z = 4138.94$**\n-   For $M_1 = 100,000\\,\\mathrm{Da}$: $z = \\frac{100000}{4138.94 - 1.0073} = \\frac{100000}{4137.9327} \\approx 24.17$.

The intensities (part of $1.0$, $0.8$, $0.5$) suggest a peak of the distribution at or above $z=25$, consistent with a unimodal profile.\n-   **Series for $M_2 = 120\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$:**\n    -   $z=31$: peak at $m/z=3871.98$ ($I=0.4$)\n    -   $z=30$: peak at $m/z=4001.01$ (contributes to $I=1.0$)\n    -   $z=29$: peak at $m/z=4138.94$ ($I=0.6$)\n    The charge states are consecutive ($29, 30, 31$). The intensities ($0.4, \\text{part of } 1.0, 0.6$) are centered around $z=30$, consistent with a unimodal profile.\n\nThe derived assignments successfully account for all five peaks and are consistent with all given principles.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Use charge-state dependent spacing predicted by the mass-to-charge relationship and require that each species’ peaks exhibit a consistent adjacent-spacing pattern and a unimodal intensity profile. This leads to the assignments: $3871.98 \\to 120\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=31$; $4001.01 \\to$ overlapping contributions from $100\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=25$ and $120\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=30$; $4138.94 \\to 120\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=29$; $4167.67 \\to 100\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=24$; $4348.83 \\to 100\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=23$.**\n-   This option correctly identifies the required methodology: using the mass-to-charge relationship to find consistent charge-state series and satisfying the unimodal intensity constraint. The assignments listed match exactly with the results derived above. Each assignment is computationally correct and the overall picture is physically coherent.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Assign the most intense peak exclusively to the lighter species and fit a single-charge series across all five peaks with constant spacing characteristic of $100\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$, yielding $z=25,24,23,22,21$ for $100\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ for the five peaks.**\n-   This procedure is flawed. It incorrectly ignores the presence of the $M_2 = 120\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ species. It also incorrectly assumes constant spacing between adjacent peaks; the spacing, $\\Delta(m/z) \\approx M/z^2$, is dependent on $z$. Finally, as shown in the derivation, peaks $3871.98$ and $4138.94$ do not yield integer charge states for $M_1$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Distinguish the species by isotopic peak-spacing differences (approximately $1/z$) and assign peaks with narrower isotopic spacing to the heavier species; label $3871.98 \\to 100\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=26$; $4001.01 \\to 100\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=25$; $4138.94 \\to 100\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=24$; $4167.67 \\to 120\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=30$; $4348.83 \\to 120\\,\\mathrm{kDa},\\,z=29$.**\n-   This procedure invokes a principle (isotopic peak spacing) for which no data is provided in the problem statement. The task is to use *only* the mass-to-charge relationship and intensity profiles. Furthermore, the proposed assignments are numerically incorrect. For example, for the peak at $m/z=3871.98$, the calculation for $M_1=100\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ gives $z \\approx 25.83$, not the integer $26$. Similarly, for $m/z=4167.67$, the calculation for $M_2=120\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ gives $z \\approx 28.80$, not $30$. Most of the assignments are inconsistent with the governing equation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Assume equal adjacent spacing across both series and treat $3871.98$ and $4138.94$ as adduct variants of the $100\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ series near $z\\approx 25$, assigning all five peaks to $100\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ with $z$ near $25$.**\n-   This option makes multiple unfounded assumptions. First, it assumes equal adjacent spacing, which is false. Second, it postulates the existence of adducts, which is not mentioned in the problem; the problem specifies a mixture of two well-defined complexes. Third, it attempts to assign all peaks to a single species, ignoring the presence of $M_2$ and the fact that not all peaks can be mathematically assigned to $M_1$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary information to derive the required expressions and calculate the dissociation constant, $K_d$. All data and premises are physically and chemically plausible for a native mass spectrometry experiment studying protein-ligand binding. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe first step is to derive the single-site occupancy probability, $p$, in terms of the free ligand concentration, $[B]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$. The probability $p$ is defined as the fraction of binding sites that are occupied by the ligand. Let $\\mathrm{E}$ denote an empty binding site and $\\mathrm{EB}$ denote a bound site. The total concentration of sites is $[\\mathrm{E}] + [\\mathrm{EB}]$. The single-site occupancy probability $p$ is therefore:\n$$p = \\frac{[\\mathrm{EB}]}{[\\mathrm{E}] + [\\mathrm{EB}]}$$\nThe problem provides the definition of the dissociation constant $K_d$ for the equilibrium $\\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{EB}$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[\\mathrm{E}][\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{EB}]}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the concentration of empty sites, $[\\mathrm{E}]$, in terms of the concentration of bound sites, $[\\mathrm{EB}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{E}] = \\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{EB}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[\\mathrm{E}]$ into the equation for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{[\\mathrm{EB}]}{\\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{EB}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]} + [\\mathrm{EB}]}$$\nThe term $[\\mathrm{EB}]$ is common to the numerator and both terms in the denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{B}]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[B]$ gives the final expression for the single-site occupancy probability:\n$$p = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{B}]}$$\n\nThe second step is to derive the occupancy distribution, $P(n)$, for $n$ bound ligands on a protein with $N=4$ identical and independent binding sites. This scenario is described by a sequence of $N$ Bernoulli trials, where each trial corresponds to the state of a binding site (either bound or unbound). The probability of \"success\" (a site being bound) is $p$, and the probability of \"failure\" (a site being unbound) is $1-p$. The probability of observing exactly $n$ successes in $N$ trials is given by the binomial distribution:\n$$P(n) = \\binom{N}{n} p^n (1-p)^{N-n}$$\nFor this specific problem, the number of sites is $N=4$, so the probability of having $n$ ligands bound to the protein is:\n$$P(n) = \\binom{4}{n} p^n (1-p)^{4-n}, \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n\nThe final step is to determine the value of $K_d$. We are given that the measured relative intensities, $I_n$, are equal to the occupancy probabilities, $P(n)$. We can use the experimental data to estimate the parameter $p$. A statistically robust method is to calculate the experimental average number of bound ligands, $\\langle n \\rangle$, and equate it to the theoretical mean of the binomial distribution, which is $N p$.\nThe experimental average occupancy is calculated as:\n$$\\langle n \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{4} n \\cdot I_n$$\nUsing the provided intensity data:\n- $I_0 = 0.089$\n- $I_1 = 0.296$\n- $I_2 = 0.368$\n- $I_3 = 0.205$\n- $I_4 = 0.042$\nWe calculate $\\langle n \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle n \\rangle = (0 \\times 0.089) + (1 \\times 0.296) + (2 \\times 0.368) + (3 \\times 0.205) + (4 \\times 0.042)$$\n$$\\langle n \\rangle = 0 + 0.296 + 0.736 + 0.615 + 0.168 = 1.815$$\nNow we relate this to the theoretical mean for $N=4$:\n$$\\langle n \\rangle = Np \\implies 1.815 = 4p$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{1.815}{4} = 0.45375$$\nNow we can use the derived relationship between $p$, $[B]$, and $K_d$ to find $K_d$. We rearrange the expression for $p$ to solve for $K_d$:\n$$p = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{B}]} \\implies p(K_d + [\\mathrm{B}]) = [\\mathrm{B}] \\implies pK_d = [\\mathrm{B}] - p[\\mathrm{B}] = [\\mathrm{B}](1-p)$$\n$$K_d = [\\mathrm{B}] \\frac{1-p}{p}$$\nWe are given $[B] = 25~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and we have calculated $p=0.45375$.\n$$K_d = (25~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\times \\frac{1 - 0.45375}{0.45375}$$\n$$K_d = (25~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\times \\frac{0.54625}{0.45375}$$\n$$K_d \\approx (25~\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\times 1.2038567$$\n$$K_d \\approx 30.09641775~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$K_d \\approx 30.1~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe final answer is expressed in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ as requested, so the numerical value is $30.1$.",
