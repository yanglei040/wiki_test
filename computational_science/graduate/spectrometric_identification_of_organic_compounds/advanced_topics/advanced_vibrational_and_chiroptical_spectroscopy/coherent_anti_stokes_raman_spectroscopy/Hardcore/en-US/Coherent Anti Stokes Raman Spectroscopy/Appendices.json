            "problem": "Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) is a powerful third-order nonlinear optical technique used for chemical analysis and imaging. In a CARS process, a pump laser beam of frequency $\\omega_p$ and a Stokes laser beam of frequency $\\omega_S$ interact with a sample. When the frequency difference $\\omega_p - \\omega_S$ matches a vibrational frequency $\\omega_v$ of a molecule in the sample, a coherent signal is generated at the anti-Stokes frequency $\\omega_{AS} = 2\\omega_p - \\omega_S$.\n\nThis signal originates from a third-order nonlinear polarization, $P_{AS}^{(3)}$, induced in the medium by the incident laser fields. The generation of the CARS signal can be described by the following set of fundamental relationships:\n\n1.  The third-order polarization at the anti-Stokes frequency is given by $P_{AS}^{(3)} = \\epsilon_0 \\chi_{CARS}^{(3)} E_p^2 E_S^*$, where $E_p$ and $E_S$ are the complex amplitudes of the pump and Stokes electric fields, respectively, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\n2.  The third-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi_{CARS}^{(3)}$, is proportional to the number density $N$ of the target molecules. This relationship is expressed as $\\chi_{CARS}^{(3)} = N \\gamma_{res}^{(3)}$, where $\\gamma_{res}^{(3)}$ is the resonant molecular hyperpolarizability, a constant for a specific molecular vibration.\n3.  The complex amplitude of the generated anti-Stokes electric field, $E_{AS}$, after propagating through an interaction length $L$ under perfect phase-matching conditions, is given by the solution to the wave equation in the slowly-varying envelope approximation: $E_{AS} = i \\frac{\\omega_{AS} L}{2 n_{AS} c} P_{AS}^{(3)}$, where $n_{AS}$ is the refractive index at frequency $\\omega_{AS}$ and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n4.  The intensity $I$ of a light wave is related to the magnitude of its complex electric field amplitude $E$ by $I = \\frac{1}{2} n c \\epsilon_0 |E|^2$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium at the wave's frequency.\n\nUsing these relationships, derive the expression for the intensity of the generated CARS signal, $I_{AS}$, as a function of the molecular number density $N$, the pump laser intensity $I_p$, and the Stokes laser intensity $I_S$. Your final answer should be of the form $f(N, I_p, I_S)$, which represents the scaling dependence of the signal. In other words, if $I_{AS} = K \\cdot f(N, I_p, I_S)$, where $K$ is a constant of proportionality that groups together all other parameters (e.g., $\\gamma_{res}^{(3)}$, $L$, frequencies, refractive indices, physical constants), determine the function $f(N, I_p, I_S)$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) spectral line shape for a single vibrational mode, an analysis of its dependence on the dephasing time $T_{2}$, and the calculation of its full width at half maximum (FWHM).\n\nThe starting point is the given causal time-domain Raman response function for the vibrational mode:\n$$\nR(t) = \\Theta(t)\\exp(-t/T_{2})\\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega_{v} t)\n$$\nwhere $\\Theta(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, $T_{2}$ is the vibrational dephasing time, and $\\omega_{v}$ is the angular frequency of the vibration.\n\nThe problem states that the resonant contribution to the third-order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(3)}_{\\text{res}}$, is proportional to the Fourier transform of $R(t)$. The appropriate frequency argument for the resonance is the difference frequency $\\Omega = \\omega_{p} - \\omega_{s}$ of the pump and Stokes fields. Let us define the Fourier transform as $\\tilde{R}(\\Omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} R(t) e^{\\mathrm{i}\\Omega t} dt$. We can now compute this transform:\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(\\Omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Theta(t)\\exp(-t/T_{2})\\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega_{v} t) e^{\\mathrm{i}\\Omega t} dt\n$$\nDue to the Heaviside function $\\Theta(t)$, the lower limit of the integral becomes $0$.\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(\\Omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t/T_{2})\\exp(\\mathrm{i}(\\Omega - \\omega_{v})t) dt\n$$\nThis is a standard integral of an exponential function:\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(\\Omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\mathrm{i}(\\Omega - \\omega_{v})\\right)t\\right) dt\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(\\Omega) = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\mathrm{i}(\\Omega - \\omega_{v})\\right)t\\right)}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\mathrm{i}(\\Omega - \\omega_{v})\\right)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\nSince $T_{2}  0$, the real part of the exponent's prefactor is negative, so the expression evaluates to $0$ at the upper limit $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. At the lower limit $t=0$, the exponential is $1$.\n$$\n\\tilde{R}(\\Omega) = 0 - \\frac{1}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\mathrm{i}(\\Omega - \\omega_{v})\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\mathrm{i}(\\Omega - \\omega_{v})}\n$$\nThe problem defines the Raman detuning as $\\Delta\\omega = (\\omega_{p}-\\omega_{s})-\\omega_{v}$. Substituting $\\Omega = \\omega_{p} - \\omega_{s}$, we find that the frequency term in the denominator is precisely this detuning: $\\Omega - \\omega_v = \\Delta\\omega$.\nThus, the resonant third-order susceptibility, as a function of the detuning $\\Delta\\omega$, is proportional to this result:\n$$\n\\chi^{(3)}_{\\text{res}}(\\Delta\\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\mathrm{i}\\Delta\\omega}\n$$\nThe CARS signal intensity, $I$, is proportional to the squared magnitude of the total third-order susceptibility, $I \\propto |\\chi^{(3)}|^2$. The problem specifies that the nonresonant background is negligible, so $\\chi^{(3)} = \\chi^{(3)}_{\\text{res}}$. The spectral line shape $I(\\Delta\\omega)$ is therefore:\n$$\nI(\\Delta\\omega) \\propto \\left| \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\mathrm{i}\\Delta\\omega} \\right|^2\n$$\nThe squared magnitude of a complex number $z = x + \\mathrm{i}y$ is $|z|^2 = x^2 + y^2$. Here, the complex number is in the denominator.\n$$\nI(\\Delta\\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\left|\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\mathrm{i}\\Delta\\omega\\right|^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}}\\right)^2 + (-\\Delta\\omega)^2}\n$$\nSo, the functional form of the CARS spectral line shape is a Lorentzian:\n$$\nI(\\Delta\\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{(\\Delta\\omega)^2 + (1/T_{2})^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze how $I(\\Delta\\omega)$ changes when $T_{2}$ decreases. The term $1/T_{2}$ is the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the Lorentzian peak, which is often denoted by $\\Gamma$. If the dephasing time $T_{2}$ decreases, its reciprocal $\\Gamma = 1/T_{2}$ increases. This means the denominator $(\\Delta\\omega)^2 + \\Gamma^2$ grows more rapidly as $|\\Delta\\omega|$ increases from $0$, indicating that the spectral line becomes broader. This is a manifestation of the time-frequency uncertainty principle: a shorter coherence lifetime in the time domain ($T_2$) leads to a larger frequency spread in the frequency domain (a broader line shape). Furthermore, the peak intensity, which occurs at resonance ($\\Delta\\omega = 0$), is $I(0) \\propto 1 / (1/T_{2})^2 = T_{2}^2$. Thus, as $T_{2}$ decreases, the peak intensity of the CARS signal also decreases.\n\nFinally, we compute the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $I(\\Delta\\omega)$. Let $C$ be the constant of proportionality, so $I(\\Delta\\omega) = C \\frac{1}{(\\Delta\\omega)^2 + (1/T_{2})^2}$.\nThe maximum intensity occurs at $\\Delta\\omega = 0$:\n$$\nI_{max} = I(0) = C \\frac{1}{0^2 + (1/T_{2})^2} = C T_{2}^2\n$$\nThe FWHM is the width of the spectrum at an intensity of $I_{max}/2$. We need to find the values of $\\Delta\\omega$, which we denote $\\pm \\Delta\\omega_{1/2}$, where the intensity is half its maximum value:\n$$\nI(\\pm\\Delta\\omega_{1/2}) = \\frac{I_{max}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nC \\frac{1}{(\\Delta\\omega_{1/2})^2 + (1/T_{2})^2} = \\frac{1}{2} C T_{2}^2\n$$\nDividing by $C$ (assuming $C \\neq 0$) and inverting both sides gives:\n$$\n(\\Delta\\omega_{1/2})^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{T_{2}^2}\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta\\omega_{1/2})^2 = \\frac{2}{T_{2}^2} - \\frac{1}{T_{2}^2} = \\frac{1}{T_{2}^2}\n$$\n$$\n|\\Delta\\omega_{1/2}| = \\frac{1}{T_{2}}\n$$\nThe value $|\\Delta\\omega_{1/2}|$ is the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), which the problem statement calls $\\Gamma$. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is the difference between the two solutions, $\\Delta\\omega_{1/2}$ and $-\\Delta\\omega_{1/2}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FWHM} = \\Delta\\omega_{1/2} - (-\\Delta\\omega_{1/2}) = 2|\\Delta\\omega_{1/2}| = \\frac{2}{T_{2}}\n$$\nThis quantity has units of angular frequency (radians per second), as required.",
