## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

In the previous chapter, we became acquainted with the mechanics of ternary expansion, a system for representing any number using just three digits: $0$, $1$, and $2$. On the surface, this might seem like a mere change of clothes for our familiar numbers. But what happens if we start to play with the rules? What if we impose a simple, almost whimsical constraint: "No $1$s allowed"? It turns out this single rule is not a limitation but a gateway, opening a door into a startlingly rich and beautiful universe of ideas that connect the most abstract mathematics to the tangible worlds of chaos, geometry, and information.

### A Universe Made of Dust: The Cantor Set

Let's begin with that rule. Consider all the numbers in the interval $[0,1]$ that can be written in base 3 using *only* the digits $0$ and $2$. This collection of numbers forms a famous object known as the Cantor set, which we'll call $C$. What does this set "look like"? If you think about its construction, you start with the interval $[0,1]$ and remove the middle third—precisely the numbers whose first ternary digit must be a $1$ (like $0.5 = (0.111\dots)_3$). Then you take the two remaining intervals, $[0, 1/3]$ and $[2/3, 1]$, and remove the middle third of each of those. You continue this process forever, at each stage removing the numbers that would require a $1$ at that position in their ternary expansion.

What you're left with is a strange "dust" of points. If you were to add up the lengths of all the intervals you removed, you'd find they sum to exactly $1$. This means the Cantor set that remains must have a total length, or "Lebesgue measure," of zero . It's full of holes. And yet, this set contains just as many points as the original, solid interval $[0,1]$—an uncountable infinity of them. It is nowhere dense, yet uncountably infinite. It contains [rational points](@article_id:194670), like $\frac{1}{4} = (0.020202\dots)_3$ or the point represented by the repeating expansion $(0.\overline{2220})_3$ , as well as irrational numbers. The humble ternary expansion provides the key to defining and exploring this paradoxical creature.

### The Devil's Staircase: Stretching Dust into a Line

The surprises don't stop there. Let's define a function, the Cantor function, which performs a magical transformation. It takes a number $x$ from our Cantor set $C$ and reads its ternary digits, which are all $0$s and $2$s. It then creates a new number by a simple substitution: it changes every $2$ to a $1$ and re-interprets the resulting sequence of $0$s and $1$s as a binary (base-2) number. For example, the point $x=\frac{2}{9}$, which is $(0.02)_3$ in ternary, is in the Cantor set. The function maps its digits $(0,2)$ to $(0,1)$, giving us the binary number $(0.01)_2$, which is $\frac{1}{4}$ .

Now for the punchline. What is the set of all possible outputs of this function when we feed it every single point from our zero-length Cantor "dust"? Astonishingly, the image is the *entire, solid* interval $[0,1]$ . Think about that. A function has taken a set with measure zero, a sparse collection of points, and stretched it—continuously, without tearing it—to perfectly cover a set with measure one. This function, sometimes called the "[devil's staircase](@article_id:142522)," reveals a profound distinction between the "length" of a set and the "number" of points it contains. The ternary representation isn't just a label; it's a genetic code that allows for this incredible geometric alchemy.

If that weren't enough, consider what happens when you take two points from the Cantor set, $s_1$ and $s_2$, and add them together. You might expect the result, $s_1+s_2$, to be another point in some sparse, dusty collection. The reality is far more shocking: the set of all possible sums, the Minkowski sum $C+C$, forms the *entire solid interval* from $0$ to $2$ . It’s as if you have two handfuls of fine sand, and by picking one grain from each hand and adding their positions, you can land *anywhere* on a two-meter ruler. The structure encoded in the ternary digits allows this "dust" to fill space through the simple act of addition.

### Symbolic Dynamics: The Oracle of Digits

Let's shift our view from static sets to dynamic action, into the realm of chaos theory. Consider a very simple-looking rule for a point $x$ hopping around on the interval $[0,1]$: at each step, we map $x$ to $3x \pmod 1$ (that is, multiply by 3 and take the fractional part). This is a classic example of a chaotic map. An initial point's trajectory can seem random and unpredictable. But ternary expansion reveals a stunningly simple order underneath the chaos.

When you write $x$ in base 3, say $x = (0.d_1 d_2 d_3 \dots)_3$, applying the map $f(x)=3x \pmod 1$ does something remarkable: it simply erases the first digit and shifts all the other digits one place to the left. The new number is $(0.d_2 d_3 d_4 \dots)_3$ . The ternary expansion of the initial point $x_0$ is therefore not just a numerical label; it is a *complete, step-by-step itinerary* of the orbit's entire future . The first digit tells you which third of the interval ($[0,1/3)$, $[1/3,2/3)$, or $[2/3,1)$) the point starts in. The second digit tells you where it will be after one step, the third digit after two steps, and so on, ad infinitum.

This connection, a cornerstone of a field called [symbolic dynamics](@article_id:269658), is incredibly powerful. Do you want to find a starting point that generates a periodic orbit repeating a certain pattern? You simply write down a repeating ternary expansion corresponding to that pattern and convert it to a fraction . Do you want to find all the starting points whose orbits only enter the "forbidden" middle third after, say, four steps? You just need to find all the numbers whose ternary expansions have their first '1' in the fifth decimal place . Complex questions about long-term dynamical behavior are transformed into simple, elegant questions about sequences of digits.

### The Code of Nature and Information

This digit-based way of thinking extends far beyond the number line. In fractal geometry, we can construct the "Cantor dust" in the plane by taking the Cartesian product of the Cantor set with itself, $C \times C$. This is a fractal made of all points $(x,y)$ in the unit square where both $x$ and $y$ have ternary expansions with only $0$s and $2$s. Slicing through this fractal reveals its intricate structure. A vertical slice at a coordinate $x$ will be non-empty if and only if $x$ itself belongs to the Cantor set. For instance, a slice at $x=1/4$ is a perfect copy of the Cantor set, because $1/4 = (0.0202\dots)_3$ uses only digits $0$ and $2$ . The number system provides the very blueprint for the geometric object.

We can even find a home for these ideas in information theory. Imagine you are designing a communication system, but for some physical reason, you can only transmit signals corresponding to the digits $0$ and $2$—your "code space" is the Cantor set. A standard ternary digit can encode $\log_2(3) \approx 1.58$ bits of information. However, your restricted digits, which can only be one of two possibilities, can each only carry $\log_2(2) = 1$ bit of information. The ternary expansion allows us to quantify the "cost" of this constraint. For any given source of information, forcing the encoding to live in the Cantor set introduces a precisely calculable amount of redundancy, or inefficiency . What began as a number-theoretic curiosity becomes a practical constraint on the flow of information. Furthermore, by viewing the digits of an expansion as random variables, we can use the tools of probability to analyze the average behavior of functions defined on these complex sets, bridging the gap between number theory and statistics .

From a simple rule about digits, we have journeyed through paradoxes of infinity, witnessed the birth of form from dust, decoded the motion of chaotic systems, and quantified the flow of information. The ternary expansion is far more than a way to write down a number. It is a language, a code, and a lens that reveals the profound and often surprising unity woven through the fabric of mathematics and science.
