The SDE is the standard risk-neutral dynamics for a non-dividend stock. The Monte Carlo pricing method described is a standard numerical technique. The question asks for the limit of the estimator, which, by the Law of Large Numbers, is the theoretical expected value. The condition $$\\sigma=0$$ is a valid and common degenerate case used to test the consistency of a model, as it represents a world with no uncertainty. In this case, the asset should grow deterministically at the risk-free rate. All parameters are properly defined with appropriate constraints. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe Monte Carlo estimator for the price of the European call option, $C_0$, is given by the sample mean of a large number, $N$, of simulated discounted payoffs:\n$$ \\hat{C}_{0,N} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{-rT} \\max(S_T^{(i)} - K, 0) $$\nwhere $S_T^{(i)}$ is the terminal stock price from the $i$-th simulation path.\n\nBy the Law of Large Numbers, as the number of simulated paths $N$ approaches infinity, the Monte Carlo estimator $\\hat{C}_{0,N}$ converges to the true expected value of the discounted payoff under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$ \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\hat{C}_{0,N} = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[e^{-rT} \\max(S_T - K, 0)\\right] $$\nSince the discount factor $e^{-rT}$ is a constant, it can be pulled out of the expectation:\n$$ C_0 = e^{-rT} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\max(S_T - K, 0)\\right] $$\nThe problem requires us to evaluate this limit under the specific condition that the volatility $\\sigma$ is set to $0$.\n\nWhen $\\sigma = 0$, the SDE for the stock price becomes:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}S_t = r S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + (0) S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t $$\n$$ \\mathrm{d}S_t = r S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nThis is no longer a stochastic differential equation but a simple first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). The stochastic component, which introduces randomness into the price path, has vanished. The solution to this ODE with the initial condition $S(0) = S_0$ is found by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}S_t}{S_t} = r \\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nIntegrating from time $0$ to time $T$:\n$$ \\int_{S_0}^{S_T} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{S} = \\int_0^T r \\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\n$$ \\ln(S_T) - \\ln(S_0) = rT $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_T}{S_0}\\right) = rT $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the terminal price $S_T$:\n$$ S_T = S_0 e^{rT} $$\nIn this zero-volatility scenario, the terminal stock price $S_T$ is a deterministic quantity, not a random variable. Every simulated path will yield the exact same terminal price.\n\nNow, we substitute this deterministic value of $S_T$ back into the expectation formula for the option price. Since the argument of the expectation is no longer random, the expectation of a constant is the constant itself:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\max(S_T - K, 0)\\right] = \\max(S_0 e^{rT} - K, 0) $$\nFinally, the price of the option is the present value of this deterministic payoff:\n$$ C_0 = e^{-rT} \\max(S_0 e^{rT} - K, 0) $$\nThis is the value to which the Monte Carlo estimator must converge.\n\nNow, we evaluate each provided option.\n\nA. $$e^{-rT}\\,\\max\\!\\big(S_0 e^{rT} - K,\\,0\\big)$$\nThis expression matches our derived result. It correctly identifies the deterministic terminal price $S_T = S_0 e^{rT}$, calculates the corresponding payoff at maturity $\\max(S_0 e^{rT} - K, 0)$, and discounts it back to the present value using the factor $e^{-rT}$. This option is **Correct**.\n\nB. $$\\max\\!\\big(S_0 e^{rT} - K,\\,0\\big)$$\nThis expression represents the undiscounted payoff at maturity $T$. The task is to find the value of the pricer, which estimates the present value (at time $0$) of the option. This option omits the necessary discounting factor $e^{-rT}$. This is the value of the option at time $T$, not at time $0$. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $$\\max\\!\\big(S_0 - K,\\,0\\big)$$\nThis is the intrinsic value of the option at time $t=0$. It is the payoff one would receive if the option could be exercised immediately. It completely ignores the time to maturity $T > 0$, the growth of the stock price, and the time value of money. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $$e^{-rT}\\,\\max\\!\\big(S_0 - K,\\,0\\big)$$\nThis expression incorrectly calculates the payoff based on the initial price $S_0$ instead of the terminal price $S_T$. It then discounts this incorrect payoff value. The payoff of a European option is fundamentally linked to the price of the underlying asset at maturity, $S_T$.

We are presented with a Monte Carlo pricer for a European call option under the Black-Scholes model, which exhibits a \"persistent discrepancy\" from the known analytical solution. Our objective is to identify the most scientifically rigorous plan to diagnose the source of this error, which could be an implementation bug, a time-discretization bias, or a finite-sample statistical error.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the problem. The asset price $S_t$ follows the stochastic differential equation (SDE) under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}S_t = r S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma S_t \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t $$\nwhere $r$ is the constant risk-free rate, $\\sigma$ is the constant volatility, and $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion. The Monte Carlo simulation uses an Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme over $m$ time steps of size $\\Delta t = T/m$:\n$$ S_{t_{i+1}} = S_{t_i} + r S_{t_i} \\Delta t + \\sigma S_{t_i} \\sqrt{\\Delta t} Z_i $$\nwhere $Z_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ are independent standard normal random variables. The MC estimator for the call price $C_0$ is:\n$$ \\hat{C}_N = e^{-rT} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\max(S_{T}^{(j)} - K, 0) $$\nwhere $S_T^{(j)}$ is the terminal price from the $j$-th simulated path.\n\nThe total error between the MC estimate $\\hat{C}_N$ and the true Black-Scholes price $C_{BS}$ can be decomposed:\n$$ \\text{Error} = \\hat{C}_N - C_{BS} = (\\hat{C}_N - \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_N]) + (\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_N] - C_{BS}) $$\nThe first term, $(\\hat{C}_N - \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_N])$, is the **statistical sampling error**, which is random and decreases in magnitude as $N \\to \\infty$, specifically with order $O(N^{-1/2})$. The second term, $(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}_N] - C_{BS})$, is the **systematic bias**. This bias is primarily due to the time discretization of the SDE. For the Euler scheme, this **discretization bias** has a weak order of convergence of $1$, meaning it is of order $O(\\Delta t)$, or $O(m^{-1})$. An **implementation bug** can manifest as an additional, often dominant, source of systematic bias, or it might incorrectly affect the statistical properties of the estimate.\n\nA robust diagnostic procedure must be able to isolate and test for each of these three potential error sources independently.\n\nLet us evaluate the proposed plans.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis plan is methodologically unsound and contains severe flaws.\n$1$. Comparing the MC estimate to a binomial tree price is a comparison of two distinct numerical approximations. Agreement between them does not imply correctness with respect to the true continuous-time model. Both could have discretization biases of similar magnitude, or one could have a bug that coincidentally cancels its bias. This test fails to isolate anything.\n$2$. The suggestion to \"switch from standard normal random numbers to uniform random numbers for the Brownian increments\" is a catastrophic error in reasoning. The SDE is defined with a Brownian motion, whose increments are necessarily Gaussian. Replacing them with uniformly distributed variables fundamentally alters the model being simulated. It is not a diagnostic test; it is the deliberate introduction of a gross modeling error. The outcome of such a procedure is meaningless.\n$3$. Testing price sensitivity (delta) by changing the strike $K$ is an indirect test. A discrepancy in the numerical delta could be a symptom of any of the three error types and does not allow for their separation. For instance, a large sampling error in the price estimate will lead to a large error in its numerical derivative.\nTherefore, this plan is filled with logical fallacies and scientifically incorrect procedures.\n**Verdict for A: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis plan is systematic, rigorous, and follows established best practices for an investigation of this nature. Each step is designed to isolate a specific source of error.\n$1$. **Testing for Discretization Bias:** The SDE for $S_t$ has a known analytical solution: $S_T = S_0 \\exp((r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T + \\sigma W_T)$, where $W_T = \\sqrt{T}Z$ with $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. By replacing the step-by-step Euler simulation with direct sampling from this exact terminal distribution, the time-discretization error is completely eliminated. If the MC estimate using this exact method aligns with the Black-Scholes price (within statistical noise), while the original Euler-based estimate does not, the discrepancy is definitively identified as discretization bias. This is a perfect control experiment.\n$2$. **Testing for Sampling Error:** The procedure of repeatedly doubling the number of paths $N$ and constructing confidence intervals is the canonical method for analyzing statistical convergence. The Central Limit Theorem dictates that the standard error of the MC mean should shrink proportionally to $N^{-1/2}$. By verifying this scaling and checking if the true $C_{BS}$ price falls within the computed confidence intervals, one can determine if the observed discrepancy is consistent with expected statistical fluctuations for the given sample size $N$.\n$3$. **Testing for Implementation Bugs:** The martingale property of the discounted asset price, $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[e^{-rT} S_T] = S_0$, is a fundamental principle of risk-neutral pricing. An MC estimator for the left-hand side, $\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^N e^{-rT} S_T^{(j)}$, should yield a value statistically close to $S_0$. A significant deviation points to a fundamental flaw in the simulation logicâ€”such as an incorrect drift term, improper scaling of the random numbers, or an error in the discounting factorâ€”which may not be revealed by simply pricing an option. This provides a clean, powerful, and independent test for the correctness of the core path generator.\n$4$. **Confirmation:** The final step, refining the number of time steps $m$ and observing the convergence of the bias towards zero, serves as a confirmation of the discretization bias diagnosis. It validates that the error behaves as theoretically predicted for a weakly convergent scheme.\nEvery part of this plan is logically sound and surgically targets a potential cause of error.\n**Verdict for B: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis plan demonstrates weaker reasoning and contains impractical suggestions.\n$1$. Verifying put-call parity, $C - P = S_0 - K e^{-rT}$, is a valid sanity check. Since the payoffs combine linearly as $\\max(S_T-K,0) - \\max(K-S_T,0) = S_T - K$, this test reduces to checking whether $e^{-rT}\\mathbb{E}[S_T] - e^{-rT}K \\approx S_0 - K e^{-rT}$, which simplifies to the martingale test $e^{-rT}\\mathbb{E}[S_T] \\approx S_0$. While a valid check, the plan's mandate to \"verify put-call parity exactly\" is impossible with a statistical method like Monte Carlo. There will always be sampling error.\n$2$. A conclusion of \"no bug\" if parity holds is not robust. For example, an implementation with an incorrect volatility $\\sigma$ would still satisfy the put-call parity relation, as the relation is independent of $\\sigma$. The test is not comprehensive.\n$3$. Comparing one discrete approximation (Euler MC) to another (a lattice method) is, as with option A, not a definitive diagnostic. It does not use the known analytical solution as the benchmark. Attributing the difference solely to \"sampling error\" is an unsubstantiated leap, as both methods have their own discretization biases which may differ.\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis plan relies on a sophisticated technique, quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC), but applies it heuristically rather than for rigorous diagnosis.\n$1$. QMC methods, using low-discrepancy sequences like Sobol', often achieve a faster convergence rate (e.g., $O(N^{-1}\\log^d N)$) than the $O(N^{-1/2})$ rate of standard MC. If switching to QMC significantly reduces the error, this suggests that the error is indeed related to the quality of sampling, pointing towards sampling error. However, this is not a definitive test. If a large discretization bias exists, both MC and QMC will converge to the same wrong, biased value. QMC will simply get there with fewer points. It does not help distinguish bias from sampling error relative to the true price.\n$2$. The diagnostic logic is weak: \"increase $m$ once\" is insufficient to analyze the trend of discretization bias. A conclusion of a \"bug\" based on failing to match the BS price \"within a single standard error\" is arbitrary and lacks statistical rigor. Standard error estimation for QMC is also non-trivial and typically requires randomization of the sequences, which the proposal does not mention.\nThis plan mistakes a variance reduction technique for a primary diagnostic tool and employs flawed, non-rigorous logic.\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, Option B presents the only comprehensive and scientifically-sound methodology. It systematically isolates each potential source of errorâ€”discretization bias, sampling error, and implementation bugsâ€”using definitive, independent tests that are standard practice in computational finance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply calculating an option's price, a robust pricer must also quantify its sensitivity to changes in market parameters for effective risk management.

The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is formulated in precise mathematical and computational terms, devoid of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent setup. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the risk-neutral valuation of a European option. Under the BSM model, the asset price $S_T$ at maturity $T$, given an initial price $S_0$, is described by a log-normal distribution. The explicit solution to the SDE is:\n$$ S_T = S_0 \\exp\\left( \\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T + \\sigma\\sqrt{T}Z \\right) $$\nwhere $Z$ is a random variable drawn from the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n\nThe option's Gamma, $\\Gamma$, is the second derivative of the option price $P$ with respect to the initial asset price $S_0$:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial^2 P(S_0)}{\\partial S_0^2} $$\nWe approximate this derivative using a central finite-difference formula:\n$$ \\Gamma \\approx \\frac{P(S_0 + \\varepsilon) - 2P(S_0) + P(S_0 - \\varepsilon)}{\\varepsilon^2} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is a small perturbation.\n\nThe option price $P(S_0)$ is the discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure:\n$$ P(S_0) = e^{-rT}\\mathbb{E}\\left[(K - S_T(S_0))^+\\right] $$\nBy substituting this into the finite-difference formula and using the linearity of the expectation operator, we can express the Gamma approximation as the expectation of a single random variable:\n$$ \\Gamma \\approx \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{e^{-rT}(K - S_T(S_0+\\varepsilon))^+ - 2e^{-rT}(K - S_T(S_0))^+ + e^{-rT}(K - S_T(S_0-\\varepsilon))^+}{\\varepsilon^2} \\right] $$\nThis formulation is ideal for a Monte Carlo estimation. We define the per-path estimator of Gamma, $\\gamma_i$, for the $i$-th simulation path:\n$$ \\gamma_i(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{p_i(S_0+\\varepsilon) - 2p_i(S_0) + p_i(S_0-\\varepsilon)}{\\varepsilon^2} $$\nwhere $p_i(S)$ denotes the discounted payoff for path $i$ starting from price $S$:\n$$ p_i(S) = e^{-rT} \\max\\left(K - S \\exp\\left( \\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T + \\sigma\\sqrt{T}Z_i \\right), 0\\right) $$\nand $Z_i$ is the $i$-th draw from $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. It is critical to use the same random variate $Z_i$ for calculating the three payoffs within the expression for $\\gamma_i$. This is the method of common random numbers, which significantly reduces the variance of the estimator.\n\nThe Monte Carlo estimator for Gamma, $\\widehat{\\Gamma}$, is the sample mean of $N$ such path estimators:\n$$ \\widehat{\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\gamma_i $$\nThe standard error of this estimator, $\\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\widehat{\\Gamma})$, is given by the sample standard deviation of the $\\gamma_i$ values, divided by the square root of the number of paths:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\widehat{\\Gamma}) = \\frac{s_\\gamma}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\gamma_i - \\widehat{\\Gamma})^2} $$\nThis entire procedure is performed twice for each test case: once with $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{\\text{small}}$ to obtain $\\widehat{\\Gamma}_{\\text{small}}$ and $\\widehat{\\text{SE}}_{\\text{small}}$, and once with $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{\\text{large}}$ to obtain $\\widehat{\\Gamma}_{\\text{large}}$ and $\\widehat{\\text{SE}}_{\\text{large}}$.\n\nFinally, the stability of the estimator with respect to the perturbation size $\\varepsilon$ is assessed. We compute the absolute difference in the estimates, $\\Delta$, and a stability threshold, $\\Theta$:\n$$ \\Delta = |\\widehat{\\Gamma}_{\\text{small}} - \\widehat{\\Gamma}_{\\text{large}}| $$\n$$ \\Theta = 2 \\cdot \\max\\{\\widehat{\\text{SE}}_{\\text{small}}, \\widehat{\\text{SE}}_{\\text{large}}\\} $$\nThe choice of $2$ is related to constructing an approximate $95\\%$ confidence interval. The estimator is deemed stable if the difference $\\Delta$ is within this threshold, i.e., $\\Delta \\le \\Theta$.
