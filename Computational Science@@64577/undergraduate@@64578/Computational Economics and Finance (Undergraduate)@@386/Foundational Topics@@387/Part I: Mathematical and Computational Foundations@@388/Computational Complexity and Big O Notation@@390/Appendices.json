This relationship is given by:\n$$T = \\frac{C}{S}$$\n\nThe problem states that the runtime, which is directly proportional to the number of operations, scales on the order of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of assets.

It is a straightforward, well-defined exercise in algorithmic analysis. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $T_{dept}(N)$ denote the time taken to compute the risk metric for a single department with $N$ positions. According to the problem statement, this is bounded above by a polynomial in $N$, such that:\n$$T_{dept}(N) \\le a N^{2} + b N + c$$\nwhere $a > 0$, $b > 0$, and $c > 0$ are constants. This corresponds to a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$ for a single department.\n\nThe bank has $D$ such departments, and they are processed sequentially. The principle of sequential composition dictates that the total time for a sequence of operations is the sum of the times for each individual operation. As there is no reuse of computation across departments, the total time required to process all $D$ departments, which we will call $T_{all\\_depts}(N, D)$, is the sum of the costs for each of the $D$ identical computations.\n$$T_{all\\_depts}(N, D) = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} T_{dept}(N) = D \\cdot T_{dept}(N)$$\nTherefore, the upper bound for this phase of the computation is:\n$$D \\cdot (a N^{2} + b N + c)$$\n\nFollowing the departmental computations, an enterprise aggregation step is performed. Let the time for this aggregation be $T_{agg}(D)$. The problem states this is bounded above by a linear function of $D$:\n$$T_{agg}(D) \\le k D$$\nwhere $k > 0$ is a constant. This corresponds to a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(D)$.\n\nThe overall process consists of the computation for all departments followed by the final aggregation. Applying the principle of sequential composition again, the total time for the firm-wide risk calculation, $T_{total}(N, D)$, is the sum of the times for these two stages.

The terms are $a D N^{2}$, $b D N$, and $(c+k)D$. According to the definition of Big-Oh notation, we need to find constants $C > 0$, $N_{0} \\ge 1$, and $D_{0} \\ge 1$ such that for all $N \\ge N_{0}$ and $D \\ge D_{0}$, the following inequality holds:\n$$a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\le C \\cdot g(N, D)$$\nwhere $g(N,D)$ is the simplest function that characterizes the growth rate.\n\nLet us choose $g(N, D) = D N^{2}$.

The problem statement does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, is not metaphorical, is self-contained, and is scientifically verifiable.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A formal solution will now be derived.\n\nFirst, we determine the total storage in bytes required for the dense storage representation, denoted as $B_{\\text{dense}}$. The number of elements in the upper triangular part of an $N \\times N$ matrix, including the main diagonal, is given by the sum $1 + 2 + \\dots + N = \\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$. Each of these elements is stored as an $8$-byte floating-point number. Therefore, the total storage cost is:\n$$B_{\\text{dense}} = 8 \\times \\frac{N(N+1)}{2} = 4N(N+1)$$\n\nNext, we determine the total storage in bytes for the sparse CSR representation, $B_{\\text{sparse}}$. This cost depends on the number of nonzero elements being stored, which we must derive from the parameter $k$. The parameter $k$ represents the average number of nonzero entries per row in the full, symmetric $N \\times N$ matrix. The total number of nonzero entries in the full matrix is therefore $NNZ_{\\text{full}} = Nk$.\nThese nonzeros consist of $N$ diagonal entries (which are assumed to be nonzero) and $Nk - N$ off-diagonal entries. Since the matrix is symmetric, the off-diagonal nonzeros exist in pairs. The sparse storage scheme only considers the upper triangular part (including the diagonal). The number of nonzero entries in this upper triangular part, $NNZ_{\\text{upper}}$, is the sum of the $N$ diagonal entries and half of the off-diagonal entries.\n$$NNZ_{\\text{upper}} = N + \\frac{Nk - N}{2} = \\frac{2N + Nk - N}{2} = \\frac{N(k+1)}{2}$$\nFor each of these $NNZ_{\\text{upper}}$ entries, we store its value ($8$ bytes) and its column index ($4$ bytes), for a total of $8+4=12$ bytes per entry. The storage for these entries is $12 \\times NNZ_{\\text{upper}}$.\nAdditionally, the CSR format requires a row-pointer array of length $N+1$, where each entry is a $4$-byte integer. The storage for this array is $4(N+1)$ bytes.\nThe total storage for the sparse scheme is the sum of these two components:\n$$B_{\\text{sparse}} = 12 \\times NNZ_{\\text{upper}} + 4(N+1) = 12 \\left(\\frac{N(k+1)}{2}\\right) + 4(N+1) = 6N(k+1) + 4(N+1)$$\n\nThe problem defines $k^{\\ast}$ as the value of $k$ for which the storage costs are equal: $B_{\\text{dense}} = B_{\\text{sparse}}$. We set up the equation using $k^{\\ast}$:\n$$4N(N+1) = 6N(k^{\\ast}+1) + 4(N+1)$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $k^{\\ast}$.\n$$4N(N+1) = 6Nk^{\\ast} + 6N + 4N + 4$$\n$$4N(N+1) = 6Nk^{\\ast} + 10N + 4$$\nRearranging to isolate the term with $k^{\\ast}$:\n$$6Nk^{\\ast} = 4N(N+1) - (10N + 4) = 4N^2 + 4N - 10N - 4$$\n$$6Nk^{\\ast} = 4N^2 - 6N - 4$$\nDividing by $6N$ to solve for $k^{\\ast}$:\n$$k^{\\ast} = \\frac{4N^2 - 6N - 4}{6N} = \\frac{4N^2}{6N} - \\frac{6N}{6N} - \\frac{4}{6N}$$\n$$k^{\\ast} = \\frac{2}{3}N - 1 - \\frac{2}{3N}$$\nNow, we substitute the given value $N=5000$:\n$$k^{\\ast} = \\frac{2}{3}(5000) - 1 - \\frac{2}{3(5000)} = \\frac{10000}{3} - 1 - \\frac{2}{15000}$$\nCalculating the terms:\n$$\\frac{10000}{3} \\approx 3333.3333...$$\n$$\\frac{2}{15000} \\approx 0.000133...$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $k^{\\ast}$:\n$$k^{\\ast} \\approx 3333.333333 - 1 - 0.000133 = 3332.3332$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
