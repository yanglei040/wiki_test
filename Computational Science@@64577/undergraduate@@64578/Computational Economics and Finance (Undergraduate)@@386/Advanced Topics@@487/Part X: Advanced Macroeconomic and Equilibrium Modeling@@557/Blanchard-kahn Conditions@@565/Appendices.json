It describes a standard exercise in the analysis of linear rational expectations models, a central topic in modern macroeconomics. All necessary componentsâ€”the system's law of motion, the classification of variables, and the specific questionâ€”are provided without ambiguity or contradiction. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is described by the linear rational expectations equation $E_t \\, y_{t+1} = A \\, y_t$, where $y_t \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix} x_t \\\\ p_t \\end{pmatrix}$ and the matrix $A$ is given as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.4 \\end{pmatrix}$. The variable $x_t$ is predetermined, meaning its value at time $t$ is known from time $t-1$. The variable $p_t$ is a non-predetermined, or \"jump\", variable, meaning its value at time $t$ can react to new information arriving at time $t$.\n\nFirst, we must verify the Blanchard-Kahn (BK) conditions for the existence of a unique, stable solution path. The BK conditions state that the number of eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ with modulus greater than $1$ must be equal to the number of jump variables in the system. In this case, we have $1$ jump variable, $p_t$. Thus, for a unique saddle path to exist, the matrix $A$ must possess exactly $1$ eigenvalue with a modulus greater than $1$.\n\nWe find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.4 \\end{pmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 - \\lambda & 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.4 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(1.2 - \\lambda)(0.4 - \\lambda) - (0.5)(0.3) = 0\n$$\n$$\n0.48 - 1.6\\lambda + \\lambda^2 - 0.15 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - 1.6\\lambda + 0.33 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we find the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1.6)^2 - 4(1)(0.33)}}{2} = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{2.56 - 1.32}}{2} = \\frac{1.6 \\pm \\sqrt{1.24}}{2}\n$$\nThe two eigenvalues are:\nThe unstable (explosive) eigenvalue, $\\lambda_u$:\n$$\n\\lambda_u = \\frac{1.6 + \\sqrt{1.24}}{2} \\approx \\frac{1.6 + 1.11355}{2} \\approx 1.35678\n$$\nAnd the stable (non-explosive) eigenvalue, $\\lambda_s$:\n$$\n\\lambda_s = \\frac{1.6 - \\sqrt{1.24}}{2} \\approx \\frac{1.6 - 1.11355}{2} \\approx 0.24323\n$$\nSince $|\\lambda_u| > 1$ and $|\\lambda_s| < 1$, there is exactly one unstable eigenvalue. This number matches the number of jump variables ($1$). Therefore, the Blanchard-Kahn conditions are satisfied, and a unique, stable saddle path exists.\n\nNext, we derive this saddle-path relationship. The general solution of the system can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of $A$. Let $v_u$ and $v_s$ be the eigenvectors corresponding to $\\lambda_u$ and $\\lambda_s$, respectively. The solution at any time $t$ is of the form $y_t = c_1 (\\lambda_u)^t v_u + c_2 (\\lambda_s)^t v_s$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants. For the system to avoid explosive behavior as $t \\to \\infty$, the term associated with the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_u$ must be eliminated. This requires setting its coefficient $c_1$ to $0$.\n\nThis constraint forces the solution vector $y_t = \\begin{pmatrix} x_t \\\\ p_t \\end{pmatrix}$ to lie on the stable manifold, which is the subspace spanned by the stable eigenvector $v_s$. Consequently, for any time $t$, the vector $y_t$ must be collinear with $v_s$. This implies a fixed proportional relationship between its components, $x_t$ and $p_t$.\n\nWe find the stable eigenvector $v_s = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{sx} \\\\ v_{sp} \\end{pmatrix}$ by solving the equation $(A - \\lambda_s I)v_s = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 - \\lambda_s & 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.4 - \\lambda_s \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{sx} \\\\ v_{sp} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the second row of this matrix equation, we obtain the relationship:\n$$\n0.3 v_{sx} + (0.4 - \\lambda_s) v_{sp} = 0\n$$\nThis gives the ratio of the components of the stable eigenvector:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{sp}}{v_{sx}} = -\\frac{0.3}{0.4 - \\lambda_s}\n$$\nSince the solution vector $y_t = \\begin{pmatrix} x_t \\\\ p_t \\end{pmatrix}$ must be parallel to $v_s$, the ratio of its components must be the same:\n$$\n\\frac{p_t}{x_t} = \\frac{v_{sp}}{v_{sx}}\n$$\nThis leads to the saddle-path relationship $p_t = F x_t$, where the coefficient $F$ is given by:\n$$\nF = -\\frac{0.3}{0.4 - \\lambda_s}\n$$\nWe now substitute the expression for the stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_s = \\frac{1.6 - \\sqrt{1.24}}{2}$:\n$$\nF = -\\frac{0.3}{0.4 - \\left(\\frac{1.6 - \\sqrt{1.24}}{2}\\right)} = -\\frac{0.3}{\\frac{2(0.4) - (1.6 - \\sqrt{1.24})}{2}} = -\\frac{0.6}{0.8 - 1.6 + \\sqrt{1.24}}\n$$\n$$\nF = -\\frac{0.6}{-0.8 + \\sqrt{1.24}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

If $n_{unstable} > n_p$, there are more stability conditions than free variables available to satisfy them. No bounded equilibrium path exists.\n3.  If $n_{unstable} < n_p$, there are fewer stability conditions than non-predetermined variables.
