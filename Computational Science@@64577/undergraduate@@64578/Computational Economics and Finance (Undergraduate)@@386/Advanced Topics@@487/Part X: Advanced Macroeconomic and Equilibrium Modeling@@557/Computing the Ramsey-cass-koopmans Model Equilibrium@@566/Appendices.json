It is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the standard Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans growth model, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and computation.\n\nThe task is to compute three quantities for given sets of parameters $(\\alpha, \\delta, \\rho, \\varepsilon)$: the logarithmic sensitivity $S(\\alpha, \\delta, \\rho)$ of the steady-state capital stock with respect to the discount rate $\\rho$, and the relative errors $R_{+}$ and $R_{-}$ in the steady-state capital stock resulting from a small perturbation $\\varepsilon$ in $\\rho$.\n\nFirst, we must derive the analytical expression for the steady-state capital stock per capita, $k^{\\ast}$. The starting point is the necessary first-order condition for a steady state:\n$$f^{\\prime}(k^{\\ast}) = \\rho + \\delta$$\nThe problem specifies a Cobb-Douglas production function, $f(k) = k^{\\alpha}$, where $k$ is the capital stock per capita and $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is the output elasticity of capital. The first derivative of this function with respect to $k$ is:\n$$f^{\\prime}(k) = \\frac{d}{dk}(k^{\\alpha}) = \\alpha k^{\\alpha-1}$$\nSubstituting this derivative into the steady-state condition gives:\n$$\\alpha (k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha-1} = \\rho + \\delta$$\nWe can now solve for $k^{\\ast}$ by isolating it:\n$$(k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha-1} = \\frac{\\rho + \\delta}{\\alpha}$$\n$$k^{\\ast} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho + \\delta}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}}$$\nThis equation provides the steady-state capital stock $k^{\\ast}$ as a function of the model parameters $\\alpha$, $\\delta$, and $\\rho$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the absolute logarithmic sensitivity, $S(\\alpha, \\delta, \\rho)$. By definition:\n$$S(\\alpha, \\delta, \\rho) = \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln k^{\\ast}(\\rho)}{\\partial \\ln \\rho}\\right|$$\nUsing the chain rule, this can be written as $\\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln k^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\rho} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\ln \\rho}\\right|$. Since $\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\rho}{\\partial \\rho} = \\frac{1}{\\rho}$, it follows that $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\ln \\rho} = \\rho$. The expression becomes:\n$$S(\\alpha, \\delta, \\rho) = \\left|\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\ln k^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\rho}\\right|$$\nTo compute this, we first find the natural logarithm of $k^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\ln k^{\\ast} = \\ln\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\rho + \\delta}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\rho + \\delta}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} \\left[ \\ln(\\rho + \\delta) - \\ln(\\alpha) \\right]$$\nNow, we differentiate $\\ln k^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\rho$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln k^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\rho} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\rho + \\delta} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho}(\\rho + \\delta) - 0 \\right] = \\frac{1}{(\\alpha-1)(\\rho + \\delta)}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $S$:\n$$S(\\alpha, \\delta, \\rho) = \\left| \\rho \\cdot \\frac{1}{(\\alpha-1)(\\rho + \\delta)} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\rho}{(\\alpha-1)(\\rho + \\delta)} \\right|$$\nGiven that $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, the term $(\\alpha-1)$ is negative. The parameters $\\rho$ and $\\delta$ are non-negative, with $\\rho > 0$, so $(\\rho+\\delta)$ is positive. Thus, the expression inside the absolute value is negative. We can simplify by removing the absolute value and negating the expression:\n$$S(\\alpha, \\delta, \\rho) = -\\frac{\\rho}{(\\alpha-1)(\\rho + \\delta)} = \\frac{\\rho}{(1-\\alpha)(\\rho + \\delta)}$$\nThis is the final analytical formula for the sensitivity $S$.\n\nFinally, we formulate the expressions for the relative changes $R_{+}$ and $R_{-}$. These are defined as:\n$$R_{+} = \\frac{\\left|k^{\\ast}(\\tilde{\\rho}_{+}) - k^{\\ast}(\\rho)\\right|}{k^{\\ast}(\\rho)}, \\quad R_{-} = \\frac{\\left|k^{\\ast}(\\tilde{\\rho}_{-}) - k^{\\ast}(\\rho)\\right|}{k^{\\ast}(\\rho)}$$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\rho}_{+} = \\rho(1+\\varepsilon)$ and $\\tilde{\\rho}_{-} = \\rho(1-\\varepsilon)$.\nThese can be rewritten as:\n$$R_{+} = \\left|\\frac{k^{\\ast}(\\tilde{\\rho}_{+})}{k^{\\ast}(\\rho)} - 1\\right|, \\quad R_{-} = \\left|\\frac{k^{\\ast}(\\tilde{\\rho}_{-})}{k^{\\ast}(\\rho)} - 1\\right|$$\nLet us compute the ratio $\\frac{k^{\\ast}(\\tilde{\\rho})}{k^{\\ast}(\\rho)}$ for a generic perturbed rate $\\tilde{\\rho}$:\n$$\\frac{k^{\\ast}(\\tilde{\\rho})}{k^{\\ast}(\\rho)} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho} + \\delta}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}}}{\\left(\\frac{\\rho + \\delta}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho} + \\delta}{\\rho + \\delta}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}}$$\nFor $R_{+}$, we substitute $\\tilde{\\rho} = \\tilde{\\rho}_{+} = \\rho(1+\\varepsilon)$:\n$$R_{+} = \\left| \\left(\\frac{\\rho(1+\\varepsilon) + \\delta}{\\rho + \\delta}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}} - 1 \\right|$$\nFor $R_{-}$, we substitute $\\tilde{\\rho} = \\tilde{\\rho}_{-} = \\rho(1-\\varepsilon)$:\n$$R_{-} = \\left| \\left(\\frac{\\rho(1-\\varepsilon) + \\delta}{\\rho + \\delta}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}} - 1 \\right|$$\nThese are the exact formulas for the relative changes.\n\nThe computational algorithm is now straightforward:\n1. For each test case $(\\alpha, \\delta, \\rho, \\varepsilon)$, calculate $S$ using its derived analytical formula.\n2.

We must determine the conditions under which such a policy is consistent with a market equilibrium where households are optimizing and firms are competitive.\n\nFirst, we analyze the implications of the policy constraint, $K/Y = \\varphi$, where $\\varphi$ is a positive constant. Taking the logarithmic derivative with respect to time gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(K) - \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(Y) = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\dot{K}}{K} = \\frac{\\dot{Y}}{Y}\n$$\nThis means that aggregate capital $K$ and aggregate output $Y$ must grow at the same constant rate, which we denote as $g_K$.\n\nNext, we examine the aggregate production function, $Y = K^{\\alpha} (A L)^{1-\\alpha}$. Taking the logarithmic derivative with respect to time yields the growth rate of output:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{Y}}{Y} = \\alpha \\frac{\\dot{K}}{K} + (1-\\alpha) \\left( \\frac{\\dot{A}}{A} + \\frac{\\dot{L}}{L} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the known growth rates $g_K = \\dot{K}/K = \\dot{Y}/Y$, $g_A = \\dot{A}/A$, and $n = \\dot{L}/L$, we get:\n$$\ng_K = \\alpha g_K + (1-\\alpha)(g_A + n) \\implies (1-\\alpha)g_K = (1-\\alpha)(g_A + n)\n$$\nAssuming $\\alpha \\neq 1$, we find that the growth rate of aggregate capital and output is determined by the exogenous growth rates of technology and population:\n$$\ng_K = g_Y = g_A + n\n$$\nWe can now determine the growth rate of per-capita output, $y_{pc} = Y/L$.\n$$\ng_{y}^{\\text{pc}} = \\frac{\\dot{y}_{pc}}{y_{pc}} = \\frac{\\dot{Y}}{Y} - \\frac{\\dot{L}}{L} = (g_A + n) - n = g_A\n$$\nThis shows that under a constant $K/Y$ policy, per-capita output must grow at the rate of technological progress, $g_A$. This is the first key quantity required by the problem.\n\nNow, we use the capital accumulation equation, $\\dot{K} = Y - C - \\delta K$, to find the implied share of consumption in output, $s_c = C/Y$. Dividing the accumulation equation by $K$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{K}}{K} = \\frac{Y}{K} - \\frac{C}{K} - \\delta\n$$\nSubstitute $\\dot{K}/K = g_A+n$, $Y/K = 1/\\varphi$, and $C/K = (C/Y)/(K/Y) = s_c/\\varphi$:\n$$\ng_A + n = \\frac{1}{\\varphi} - \\frac{s_c}{\\varphi} - \\delta = \\frac{1-s_c}{\\varphi} - \\delta\n$$\nSolving for the consumption share $s_c$ gives:\n$$\ns_c = 1 - \\varphi (g_A + n + \\delta)\n$$\nFor a solution to be economically meaningful, consumption must be positive but less than total output, which requires $0 < s_c < 1$.

The condition $s_c > 0$ implies $1 - \\varphi(g_A+n+\\delta) > 0$, or $\\varphi < 1/(g_A+n+\\delta)$.\n\nThe analysis so far has only relied on production and resource feasibility. Now we must incorporate the household's intertemporal optimization, which is summarized by the Euler equation for per-capita consumption $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{c}}{c} = \\frac{1}{\\theta} (r - \\rho)\n$$\nUnder perfect competition, the net return on capital $r$ is the marginal product of capital net of depreciation: $r = R - \\delta = \\alpha (Y/K) - \\delta$. The policy $K/Y=\\varphi$ implies that the rate of return is constant:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\varphi} - \\delta\n$$\nSince $r$ is constant, the Euler equation implies that per-capita consumption grows at a constant rate, which we denote as $g_c^{\\text{Euler}}$:\n$$\ng_c^{\\text{Euler}} = \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\varphi} - \\delta - \\rho \\right)\n$$\nThis is the growth rate of per-capita consumption that ensures households are on their optimal path, given the return on capital implied by the policy $\\varphi$.\n\nFor the model to be in a full equilibrium, the growth rate of per-capita consumption from the household's side ($g_c^{\\text{Euler}}$) must be consistent with the growth rate implied by the production side. Since $s_c = C/Y$ is constant, aggregate consumption $C$ must grow at the same rate as aggregate output $Y$, which is $g_Y = g_A+n$. The growth rate of per-capita consumption $c=C/L$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{c}}{c} = \\frac{\\dot{C}}{C} - \\frac{\\dot{L}}{L} = (g_A+n) - n = g_A\n$$\nThis means that for the path to be feasible, per-capita consumption must grow at the same rate as per-capita output, $g_A$. Therefore, a consistent equilibrium requires $g_c^{\\text{Euler}} = g_y^{\\text{pc}} = g_A$.\n$$\ng_A = \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\varphi} - \\delta - \\rho \\right)\n$$\nThis equation defines the unique capital-output ratio, which we denote $\\varphi^{\\star}$, that is consistent with a balanced growth path equilibrium:\n$$\n\\theta g_A + \\delta + \\rho = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\varphi^{\\star}} \\implies \\varphi^{\\star} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\theta g_A + \\delta + \\rho}\n$$\n\nTo solve the numerical problem for a given policy value $\\varphi_{\\text{policy}}$, we follow these steps:\n1.  Calculate the unique equilibrium-consistent capital-output ratio, $\\varphi^{\\star} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\theta g_A + \\delta + \\rho}$. This value depends only on the fundamental parameters of the economy, not the specific policy being tested.\n2.  Calculate the per-capita consumption growth rate implied by the Euler equation under the policy $\\varphi_{\\text{policy}}$, which is $g_c^{\\text{Euler}} = \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\varphi_{\\text{policy}}} - \\delta - \\rho \\right)$.\n3.  The per-capita output growth rate implied by the production side with a constant $K/Y$ is always $g_y^{\\text{pc}} = g_A$.\n4.

This exercise [@problem_id:2381853] introduces the workhorse technique of system linearization to approximate this stable path and find the correct initial consumption value. You will apply this powerful method to a model variant that includes \"catching up with the Joneses\" preferences, demonstrating how the technique can be adapted to more complex and realistic economic environments.", "id": "2381853", "problem": "You will compute equilibrium objects and the local stable dynamics of the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model under “catching up with the Joneses” preferences. Consider a representative-agent economy in continuous time with no population growth and no exogenous productivity growth. The representative household’s instantaneous utility depends on relative consumption given by $(c/C_{\\text{agg}}^{\\phi})$, where $c$ is individual consumption, $C_{\\text{agg}}$ is aggregate consumption, and $\\phi \\in [0,1)$ measures the strength of the externality. The instantaneous period utility is constant relative risk aversion (CRRA): $u(x) = \\dfrac{x^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}$ for $\\sigma > 0$, $\\sigma \\neq 1$, and $u(x) = \\ln x$ for $\\sigma = 1$. Preferences are time-separable with pure rate of time preference $\\rho > 0$. In a symmetric equilibrium, $C_{\\text{agg}} = c$.\n\nThe production side uses a Cobb–Douglas production function with total factor productivity normalized to $A = 1$, so that $f(k) = k^{\\alpha}$ for $0 < \\alpha < 1$, where $k$ is capital per capita. Capital depreciates at rate $\\delta > 0$. The resource constraint in per capita terms is $\\dot{k} = f(k) - c - \\delta k$ with given initial capital $k(0) = k_{0} > 0$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of the representative planner’s problem and the first-order conditions of optimal control, and using that in symmetric equilibrium $C_{\\text{agg}} = c$, it can be shown that the dynamic system for $(k,c)$ is:\n- $\\dot{k} = f(k) - \\delta k - c$,\n- $\\dfrac{\\dot{c}}{c} = \\dfrac{f'(k) - \\delta - \\rho}{D}$, where $D \\equiv \\sigma + \\phi(1 - \\sigma)$.\n\nThe steady state $(k^{\\ast}, c^{\\ast})$ is defined by $\\dot{k} = 0$ and $\\dot{c} = 0$. For Cobb–Douglas production $f(k) = k^{\\alpha}$, this yields $f'(k^{\\ast}) = \\delta + \\rho$, $k^{\\ast} = \\left(\\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\delta + \\rho}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}$, and $c^{\\ast} = f(k^{\\ast}) - \\delta k^{\\ast}$. Linearizing the two-dimensional system $(\\dot{k}, \\dot{c})$ around the steady state gives the Jacobian with eigenvalues $\\lambda$ solving $\\lambda^{2} - \\rho \\lambda + \\dfrac{c^{\\ast} f''(k^{\\ast})}{D} = 0$, where $f''(k) = \\alpha(\\alpha - 1) k^{\\alpha - 2} < 0$. The unique stable eigenvalue is the negative root, and the slope of the local stable manifold in $(k,c)$ space at $(k^{\\ast}, c^{\\ast})$ equals the ratio of the stable eigenvector’s $c$-component to its $k$-component, which is $S = \\rho - \\lambda_{\\text{s}} = \\dfrac{\\rho + \\sqrt{\\rho^{2} - 4 \\dfrac{c^{\\ast} f''(k^{\\ast})}{D}}}{2}$.

The extension to \"catching up with the Joneses\" preferences is a standard and well-studied variation. All provided equations are correct derivations from the model's first-order conditions in a symmetric equilibrium. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem sets a clear, unambiguous computational task. It provides all necessary parameters and formulas for a direct calculation. For the given parameter ranges, a unique saddle-path stable equilibrium exists, ensuring the quantities to be computed are well-defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, formal mathematical and economic language, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe parameter set for the dynamic system is checked for internal consistency. The term $D \\equiv \\sigma + \\phi(1-\\sigma)$ must be positive to ensure economic sensibility, and the term under the square root in the expression for $S$ must be non-negative.\nFor all test cases, $\\sigma > 0$ and $\\phi \\in [0,1)$. The term $D$ is $D = 1.5$ for Case $1$, $D=1.01$ for Case $2$, and $D=1$ for Case $3$ ($\\sigma=1$). All are positive.\nThe term inside the square root is $\\rho^2 - 4 c^{\\ast} f''(k^{\\ast})/D$. For a physically meaningful economy, steady-state consumption $c^{\\ast}$ must be positive. This requires $(k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha} > \\delta k^{\\ast}$, which simplifies to $(k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha-1} > \\delta$. Using the steady-state condition $\\alpha (k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha-1} = \\delta + \\rho$, this is equivalent to $(\\delta+\\rho)/\\alpha > \\delta$, or $\\rho > \\delta(\\alpha-1)$. Since $\\rho>0$, $\\delta>0$, and $\\alpha<1$, this condition always holds.\nThe second derivative of the Cobb-Douglas production function, $f''(k) = \\alpha(\\alpha-1)k^{\\alpha-2}$, is strictly negative for $k>0$ and $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$.\nTherefore, the term $-4 c^{\\ast} f''(k^{\\ast})/D$ is strictly positive. The entire expression under the square root, $\\rho^2 - 4 c^{\\ast} f''(k^{\\ast})/D$, is thus strictly positive.\nThe problem setup is free of scientific, mathematical, or logical flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n**Solution Design**\n\nThe task is to implement a program that computes four key quantities for the specified economic model for three different parameter sets. The solution will proceed by applying the provided formulas sequentially for each case.\n\nFor each test case, defined by the parameter tuple $(\\alpha, \\sigma, \\phi, \\rho, \\delta, k_{0\\_\\text{ratio}})$, the following computational steps are performed:\n\n1.  **Compute Steady-State Capital ($k^{\\ast}$)**: The steady state is characterized by the condition that the marginal product of capital, net of depreciation, equals the rate of time preference, $f'(k^{\\ast}) - \\delta = \\rho$. For the Cobb-Douglas production function $f(k) = k^{\\alpha}$, this becomes $\\alpha (k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha-1} = \\delta + \\rho$. Solving for $k^{\\ast}$ gives the formula:\n    $$k^{\\ast} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta + \\rho}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}$$\n\n2.  **Set Initial Capital ($k_{0}$)**: The initial capital stock $k_{0}$ is specified as a multiple of the steady-state capital $k^{\\ast}$.\n    $$k_{0} = k_{0\\_\\text{ratio}} \\times k^{\\ast}$$\n\n3.  **Compute Steady-State Consumption ($c^{\\ast}$)**: At the steady state, capital is constant ($\\dot{k}=0$), so all output is used for either consumption or replacing depreciated capital. From the resource constraint $\\dot{k} = f(k) - \\delta k - c$, we have:\n    $$c^{\\ast} = f(k^{\\ast}) - \\delta k^{\\ast} = (k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha} - \\delta k^{\\ast}$$\n\n4.  **Compute Preference Parameter ($D$)**: This composite parameter appears in the denominator of the consumption dynamics equation and adjusts the consumer's response to interest rate changes based on the strength of the consumption externality. It is defined as:\n    $$D = \\sigma + \\phi(1-\\sigma)$$\n    Note that for the log-utility case $\\sigma=1$, $D=1$.\n\n5.  **Compute Second Derivative of Production Function ($f''(k^{\\ast})$)**: This term captures the curvature of the production function at the steady state and is crucial for determining the local dynamics.\n    $$f''(k^{\\ast}) = \\alpha(\\alpha - 1) (k^{\\ast})^{\\alpha - 2}$$\n\n6.  **Compute Stable Manifold Slope ($S$)**: The system dynamics around the steady state are those of a saddle point. The stable manifold slope $S$ determines the initial consumption level that places the economy on the unique convergence path to the steady state. It is given by the formula involving the positive root of the characteristic equation of the linearized system:\n    $$S = \\frac{\\rho + \\sqrt{\\rho^2 - 4 \\frac{c^{\\ast} f''(k^{\\ast})}{D}}}{2}$$\n\n7.  **Compute Linearized Initial Consumption ($c_{0,\\text{lin}}$)**: A first-order Taylor approximation of the stable manifold around the steady state $(k^{\\ast}, c^{\\ast})$ is a line with slope $S$. This approximation gives the initial consumption $c(0)$ as a function of initial capital $k(0) = k_0$:\n    $$c_{0,\\text{lin}} = c^{\\ast} + S (k_0 - k^{\\ast})$$\n\nThese steps will be implemented in a program that iterates through the three test cases, performs these calculations, and formats the four resulting floating-point numbers—$k^{\\ast}$, $c^{\\ast}$, $S$, and $c_{0,\\text{lin}}$—into the specified output structure.
