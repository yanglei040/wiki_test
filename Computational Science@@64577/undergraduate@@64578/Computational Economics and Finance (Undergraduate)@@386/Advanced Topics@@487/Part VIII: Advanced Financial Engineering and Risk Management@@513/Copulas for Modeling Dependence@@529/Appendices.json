Mastering this technique is the first practical skill required for any empirical copula analysis.

The analyst collects the prices for six consecutive trading days, as shown below:\n\n- Day 1: (Stock X: $102, Stock Y: $55)\n- Day 2: (Stock X: $105, Stock Y: $53)\n- Day 3: (Stock X: $101, Stock Y: $58)\n- Day 4: (Stock X: $108, Stock Y: $60)\n- Day 5: (Stock X: $105, Stock Y: $59)\n- Day 6: (Stock X: $104, Stock Y: $55)\n\nTo prepare the data for a non-parametric dependence analysis, the analyst must convert this raw data into a set of \"normalized rank coordinates\". This transformation maps the original bivariate observations $(X_i, Y_i)$ to a new set of coordinates $(u_i, v_i)$ on the unit square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\nThe transformation rule for a dataset of size $n$ is as follows: For each observation $X_i$ in the set $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_n\\}$, its transformed coordinate is $u_i = \\frac{R(X_i)}{n+1}$, where $R(X_i)$ is the rank of $X_i$ when the set is sorted in ascending order (from 1 for the smallest to $n$ for the largest). The same rule applies to the $Y$ observations.
