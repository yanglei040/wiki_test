Given a centered data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times n}$, the sample covariance matrix is $\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{T-1} X^\\top X$. The principal components are the eigenvectors of $\\Sigma$ corresponding to its eigenvalues, ordered from largest to smallest.\n- Standardization transforms each variable $x_j$ to $\\tilde{x}_j = \\frac{x_j - \\bar{x}_j}{\\hat{\\sigma}_j}$, where $\\bar{x}_j$ is the sample mean and $\\hat{\\sigma}_j$ is the sample standard deviation, so that each standardized variable has unit sample variance.

It is scientifically sound, resting on foundational principles of linear algebra and statistics, and all parameters and procedures are specified with sufficient clarity to permit a unique, verifiable solution. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe central thesis is that PCA, as a variance-maximization technique, is not scale-invariant. When variables are measured in disparate units (e.g., a stock price in dollars versus its trading volume in millions of shares), the variable with the largest variance will mechanically dominate the first principal component. This is often an artifact of the units chosen rather than an indicator of true underlying importance. Standardization is the standard remedy, transforming all variables to a common scale (unit variance) so that the analysis focuses on the correlation structure of the data, not the arbitrary measurement scales.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the data generation and analysis pipeline.\n\n**1. Data-Generating Process**\n\nFor each test case $k$, we are given a sample size $T_k$, number of variables $n_k$, factor loadings $b^{(k)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_k}$, idiosyncratic standard deviations $u^{(k)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_k}$, and unit scales $s^{(k)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_k}$.\n\nThe data are generated from a single-factor model. A common latent factor $f_t$ is drawn from a standard normal distribution, $f_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, for each time point $t=1, \\dots, T_k$. For each variable $j=1, \\dots, n_k$, an idiosyncratic noise term $e_{t,j}$ is drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(0, (u^{(k)}_j)^2)$. All $f_t$ and $e_{t,j}$ are mutually independent.\n\nThe observed value for variable $j$ at time $t$ is constructed as:\n$$\nx_{t,j} = s^{(k)}_j \\left( b^{(k)}_j f_t + e_{t,j} \\right)\n$$\nThis forms a data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T_k \\times n_k}$ whose columns represent the different variables. The scale factor $s^{(k)}_j$ represents the arbitrary unit of measurement for variable $j$.\n\n**2. PCA on Raw Data (Covariance-Based PCA)**\n\nThe first step in PCA is to center the data by subtracting the column-wise sample mean. Let $\\bar{x}_j = \\frac{1}{T_k} \\sum_{t=1}^{T_k} x_{t,j}$ be the sample mean of the $j$-th variable. The centered data matrix, denoted $X_c$, has entries $(X_c)_{t,j} = x_{t,j} - \\bar{x}_j$.\n\nThe sample covariance matrix $\\Sigma_{\\text{raw}}$ is then computed:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\text{raw}} = \\frac{1}{T_k-1} X_c^\\top X_c\n$$\nThe principal components are the eigenvectors of $\\Sigma_{\\text{raw}}$. We perform an eigendecomposition of this matrix:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\text{raw}} V = V \\Lambda\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the matrix of orthonormal eigenvectors and $\\Lambda$ is the diagonal matrix of corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are sorted in descending order, $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_{n_k}$. The first principal component is the eigenvector $v_1$ associated with the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$. For this problem, we denote this eigenvector as $v_{\\text{raw}}$ and the eigenvalue as $\\lambda_{\\text{raw}}$.\n\n**3. PCA on Standardized Data (Correlation-Based PCA)**\n\nTo remove the effect of arbitrary scaling, we standardize the data. For each column $j$ of the original data matrix $X$, we compute its sample standard deviation, $\\hat{\\sigma}_j = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T_k-1} \\sum_{t=1}^{T_k} (x_{t,j} - \\bar{x}_j)^2}$.\n\nThe standardized data matrix $Z$ is constructed with entries:\n$$\nz_{t,j} = \\frac{x_{t,j} - \\bar{x}_j}{\\hat{\\sigma}_j}\n$$\nBy construction, each column of $Z$ has a sample mean of $0$ and a sample variance of $1$.\n\nPCA is then performed on this standardized data $Z$. The relevant matrix is the sample covariance matrix of $Z$, which we denote $\\Sigma_{\\text{std}}$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\text{std}} = \\frac{1}{T_k-1} Z^\\top Z\n$$\nSince each column of $Z$ has unit variance, the diagonal elements of $\\Sigma_{\\text{std}}$ are all $1$, and the off-diagonal elements $(i, j)$ are the sample correlation coefficients between the original variables $x_i$ and $x_j$. Thus, $\\Sigma_{\\text{std}}$ is the sample correlation matrix of $X$.\n\nWe perform an eigendecomposition of $\\Sigma_{\\text{std}}$ to find its largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\text{std}}$, and the corresponding eigenvector, $v_{\\text{std}}$.\n\n**4. Diagnostic Metrics**\n\nTo quantify the distortion caused by failing to standardize, we compute two metrics:\n\n- **Angle between Principal Components**: The principal component directions $v_{\\text{raw}}$ and $v_{\\text{std}}$ are unit vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n_k}$. The angle between them measures how much the direction of maximum variance shifts. Since eigenvectors are defined only up to a sign (i.e., if $v$ is an eigenvector, so is $-v$), we compute the acute angle between the lines they span:\n  $$\n  \\theta = \\arccos\\left( \\left| v_{\\text{raw}}^\\top v_{\\text{std}} \\right| \\right)\n  $$\n  A value of $\\theta=0$ indicates perfect alignment, while a large angle (approaching $\\pi/2$) indicates severe misalignment.\n\n- **Difference in Explained Variance Share**: The fraction of total variance explained by the first principal component is given by its eigenvalue divided by the sum of all eigenvalues. The sum of eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the matrix, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_k} \\Sigma_{jj}$, which represents the total variance in the data. We compute the absolute difference in the explained variance share:\n  $$\n  \\Delta = \\left| \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{raw}}}{\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma_{\\text{raw}})} - \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{std}}}{\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma_{\\text{std}})} \\right|\n  $$\n  Note that for standardized data, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\Sigma_{\\text{std}}) = n_k$, the number of variables. A large $\\Delta$ indicates that the two methods give a very different assessment of the importance of the first component.\n\nThe procedure will be executed for each test case using the specified parameters and a fixed random seed for reproducibility. The results are expected to show minimal distortion for Case $1$ (similar scales) and significant distortion for Cases $2$ and $3$ (disparate scales), validating the necessity of standardization in practice.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the PCA problem by comparing results from raw and standardized data.\n\n    This function iterates through a set of predefined test cases.

We must first validate the problem's integrity. The problem is well-defined, scientifically grounded in the principles of linear algebra and statistics, and all parameters are specified. It presents a standard computational task in robust statistics. Thus, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a technique for dimensionality reduction that identifies the directions of maximal variance in a dataset. Let $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times N}$ be the data matrix, where $T$ represents time points and $N$ represents assets. The first step in PCA is to center the data by subtracting the mean of each column (asset). This yields the centered matrix $X_c$.\n\nThe first principal component (PC1) is defined as the loading vector $v_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$, a unit vector, that maximizes the variance of the data projected onto it. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nv_1 = \\arg\\max_{\\|v\\|=1} \\mathrm{Var}(X_c v)\n$$\nThe sample variance of a projected time series $y = X_c v$ of length $T$ is given by $\\mathrm{Var}(y) = \\frac{1}{T-1} \\sum_{i=1}^T (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$. Since $X_c$ is centered, the mean of any projection $X_c v$ is zero. The expression for variance thus simplifies, leading to the optimization:\n$$\nv_1 = \\arg\\max_{\\|v\\|=1} \\frac{1}{T-1} (X_c v)^\\top (X_c v) = \\arg\\max_{\\|v\\|=1} v^\\top \\left(\\frac{1}{T-1} X_c^\\top X_c\\right) v = \\arg\\max_{\\|v\\|=1} v^\\top S v\n$$\nwhere $S = \\frac{1}{T-1} X_c^\\top X_c$ is the sample covariance matrix of the assets. From the Rayleigh quotient theorem, the vector $v_1$ that maximizes $v^\\top S v$ is the eigenvector of $S$ corresponding to its largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1$. This eigenvector constitutes the first principal component loading vector.\n\nThe explained variance ratio for PC1, denoted $\\rho_1$, is the fraction of total variance captured by the first component. The total variance is the sum of the variances of all assets, which equals the trace of the covariance matrix, $\\mathrm{Tr}(S)$. The variance captured by PC1 is $\\lambda_1$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\rho_1 = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\mathrm{Tr}(S)}\n$$\nComputationally, performing an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix $S$ can be numerically unstable, especially for ill-conditioned data. A more robust method is to use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the centered data matrix $X_c$. Let the SVD of $X_c$ be:\n$$\nX_c = U \\Sigma V^\\top\n$$\nwhere $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ are orthogonal matrices, and $\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times N}$ contains the singular values $s_k$ on its diagonal. The columns of $V$ are the principal component loading vectors, so $v_1$ is the first column of $V$. The eigenvalues of $S$ are related to the singular values of $X_c$ by $\\lambda_k = \\frac{s_k^2}{T-1}$. The explained variance ratio $\\rho_1$ can be expressed in terms of singular values, which elegantly avoids the dependence on the sample size term:\n$$\n\\rho_1 = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\sum_{k=1}^N \\lambda_k} = \\frac{s_1^2 / (T-1)}{\\sum_{k=1}^N s_k^2 / (T-1)} = \\frac{s_1^2}{\\sum_{k=1}^N s_k^2}\n$$\nThis SVD-based approach will be used for all calculations.\n\nThe procedure for each given case $(N, T, A, t^\\star, \\tau_{\\mathrm{high}}, \\tau_{\\mathrm{low}}, \\tau_{\\mathrm{align}}, \\text{seed})$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Data Generation:** A baseline matrix $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times N}$ is generated with independent and identically distributed entries from a standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, using the specified random seed for reproducibility. The data matrix $X$ is formed by introducing a point outlier of magnitude $A$ at the element $(t^\\star, 0)$, corresponding to the direction $u = e_1$:\n    $$\n    X = Z, \\quad X_{t^\\star, 0} \\leftarrow Z_{t^\\star, 0} + A\n    $$\n\n2.  **Analysis of Full Dataset:**\n    - The matrix $X$ is centered by subtracting the column-wise sample means to obtain $X_c$.\n    - The SVD of $X_c$ is computed: $X_c = U \\Sigma V^\\top$.\n    - The PC1 loading vector is the first column of $V$, which corresponds to the first row of $V^\\top$. Let this be $v_1$.\n    - The explained variance ratio is calculated as $\\rho_1 = s_1^2 / \\sum_k s_k^2$.\n    - The alignment with the outlier direction $u=e_1$ is computed as $\\alpha = |\\langle v_1, e_1 \\rangle| = |(v_1)_1|$, which is the absolute value of the first element of $v_1$.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Reduced Dataset:**\n    - The outlier observation, which is the entire row at index $t^\\star$, is deleted from $X$ to form a new matrix $X' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T-1) \\times N}$.\n    - This reduced matrix $X'$ is re-centered using its own column-wise sample means to produce $X'_c$. The number of observations is now $T-1$.\n    - The SVD of $X'_c$ is computed. Let the new singular values be $s'_k$.\n    - The explained variance ratio for the PC1 of the reduced dataset is calculated as $\\tilde{\\rho}_1 = (s'_1)^2 / \\sum_k (s'_k)^2$.\n\n4.  **Verification of Dominance Conditions:** The final step is to evaluate if all three specified conditions are met simultaneously:\n    $$\n    (\\rho_1 > \\tau_{\\mathrm{high}}) \\land (\\tilde{\\rho}_1 < \\tau_{\\mathrm{low}}) \\land (\\alpha > \\tau_{\\mathrm{align}})\n    $$\n    The result for the case is a boolean value representing the outcome of this logical expression. This entire procedure is repeated for each test case provided.
