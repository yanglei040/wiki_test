The efficient frontier describes the set of optimal portfolios. The weights of assets in these portfolios are functions of the desired expected return. While standard unconstrained theory implies linear relationships, the inclusion of no-short-selling constraints ($w_i \\ge 0$) makes the problem a quadratic program, and the relationship can be more complex (piecewise). The assumption of a quadratic relationship $w_i(\\mu)$ over a small interval is a reasonable and common modeling choice for interpolation in computational finance. Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness and Consistency**: A polynomial of degree at most two, $P(\\mu) = a\\mu^2 + b\\mu + c$, is uniquely determined by three distinct points. The problem provides three pairs of $(\\mu, w_i)$ for each asset, which is exactly the data required to determine the unique interpolating polynomial for each $w_i(\\mu)$.\n- **Internal Consistency Check**: The problem states portfolios are fully invested, so the weights must sum to $1$.\n  - At $\\mu_1 = 0.08$: $0.20 + 0.50 + 0.30 = 1.00$.\n  - At $\\mu_2 = 0.10$: $0.35 + 0.40 + 0.25 = 1.00$.\n  - At $\\mu_3 = 0.12$: $0.50 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 1.00$.\n  The provided data is consistent with this constraint. Let $W(\\mu) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,B,C\\}} w_i(\\mu)$. Since each $w_i(\\mu)$ is a polynomial of degree at most two, $W(\\mu)$ must also be a polynomial of degree at most two. As $W(\\mu_1) = W(\\mu_2) = W(\\mu_3) = 1$, the only such polynomial is the constant polynomial $W(\\mu) = 1$. This implies that if we correctly determine the individual $w_i(\\mu)$ polynomials, their sum will necessarily be $1$ for all $\\mu$. This demonstrates the problem's internal logical consistency.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. It is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe task is to find a polynomial of degree at most two for each asset weight $w_i(\\mu)$ and then evaluate it at $\\mu^{\\ast} = 0.105$. The data points for the independent variable $\\mu$ are $\\{0.08, 0.10, 0.12\\}$. These points are equally spaced. To simplify the algebra of interpolation, we perform a linear transformation of the independent variable.

The change in a single data point has a **global** effect on the entire interpolating polynomial.\n\nNow, we analyze the effect on the instantaneous forward curve, $f(\\tau)$.

The change in the forward curve is:\n$$\n\\Delta f(\\tau) = \\hat f(\\tau) - f(\\tau) = (\\hat y(\\tau) - y(\\tau)) + \\tau (\\hat y'(\\tau) - y'(\\tau)) = \\Delta y(\\tau) + \\tau [\\Delta y(\\tau)]'\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta y(\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\Delta f(\\tau) = (\\tilde y_k - y_k) L_k(\\tau) + \\tau [(\\tilde y_k - y_k) L_k'(\\tau)]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta f(\\tau) = (\\tilde y_k - y_k) [L_k(\\tau) + \\tau L_k'(\\tau)]\n$$\nThe term $L_k(\\tau) + \\tau L_k'(\\tau)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$. Let $L_k(\\tau) = c\\tau^n + \\dots$, where $c$ is a non-zero constant. Then $L_k'(\\tau) = nc\\tau^{n-1} + \\dots$, and $\\tau L_k'(\\tau) = nc\\tau^n + \\dots$. The sum is $(n+1)c\\tau^n + \\dots$, which is a non-zero polynomial of degree $n$. Therefore, $\\Delta f(\\tau)$ is a non-zero polynomial of degree $n$ (assuming $\\tilde y_k \\neq y_k$). A non-zero polynomial of degree $n$ is zero at most at $n$ distinct points. This demonstrates that the change in the forward curve is not localized but affects the entire curve, i.e., $f(\\tau)$ changes for almost all $\\tau$.\n\nFurthermore, it is a well-known deficiency of high-degree global polynomial interpolation that it is prone to large oscillations, particularly near the ends of the interpolation interval (Runge's phenomenon). A local perturbation in the data can induce or exacerbate these oscillations across the entire domain. Such oscillations in $y(\\tau)$ and its derivative $y'(\\tau)$ can lead to economically unrealistic behavior in the forward curve $f(\\tau) = y(\\tau) + \\tau y'(\\tau)$. Specifically, $f(\\tau)$ may become negative for certain maturities $\\tau > 0$, which implies an arbitrage opportunity. A non-negative forward curve is a necessary condition for monotonic discounting, since the derivative of the discount factor is $P'(\\tau) = -f(\\tau)P(\\tau) \\le 0$ requires $f(\\tau) \\ge 0$ (as $P(\\tau) > 0$).

The change is global. Global polynomial interpolants are known to introduce spurious oscillations. These oscillations can lead to the forward curve $f(\\tau)$ becoming negative, which violates the no-arbitrage condition of non-negative forward rates and, consequently, the principle of monotonic discounting.\n\n**C.
