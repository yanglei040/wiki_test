The objective function is the weighted sum of squared Euclidean distances, a standard choice in location analysis and statistics representing variance or cost. The constraint is a linear equality, defining an affine hyperplane. The formulation is firmly rooted in convex optimization and is mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The objective function $f(x)$ is a sum of squared norms. It can be expanded as:\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i (x - x_i)^\\top (x - x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i (x^\\top x - 2x^\\top x_i + x_i^\\top x_i)$$\n$$f(x) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\right) x^\\top x - 2x^\\top \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i x_i^\\top x_i\\right)$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $x$. The Hessian matrix is $\\nabla^2_x f(x) = 2 \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\right) I_d$, where $I_d$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix. Since all $w_i > 0$, the total weight $\\sum w_i > 0$, and the Hessian is positive definite. This confirms that $f(x)$ is a strictly convex function. The constraint set $C = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\mid a^\\top x = b\\}$ is an affine subspace, which is a convex set. Minimizing a strictly convex function over a non-empty convex set guarantees the existence of a unique solution. The problem is therefore well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**.

The feasible region defined by the linear inequalities is a closed and bounded set (a compact set). Specifically, it is a triangle in the $xy$-plane with vertices at $(2,0)$, $(10,0)$, and $(2,8)$. Being a polygon, the feasible region is convex.\n\nNext, we analyze the objective function $U(x,y)$. To determine its convexity/concavity, we compute the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives.\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = 12 - 3x + 0.6y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = 10 - 2y + 0.6x\n$$\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2} = -3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial y^2} = -2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0.6\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix $H$ is:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & 0.6 \\\\ 0.6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe principal minors of $H$ are $D_1 = -3$ and $D_2 = \\det(H) = (-3)(-2) - (0.6)(0.6) = 6 - 0.36 = 5.64$.\nSince $D_1 < 0$ and $D_2 > 0$, the Hessian matrix is negative definite. This implies that the function $U(x,y)$ is strictly concave.\n\nMaximizing a strictly concave function over a compact convex set guarantees the existence of a unique global maximum. This maximum can occur either in the interior of the feasible region or on its boundary.\n\nLet us first find the unconstrained maximum by setting the gradient of $U(x,y)$ to zero:\n$$\n12 - 3x + 0.6y = 0 \\implies 3x - 0.6y = 12\n$$\n$$\n10 - 2y + 0.6x = 0 \\implies -0.6x + 2y = 10\n$$\nSolving this system of linear equations. From the second equation, $2y = 10 + 0.6x$, which gives $y = 5 + 0.3x$. Substituting into the first equation:\n$$\n3x - 0.6(5 + 0.3x) = 12\n$$\n$$\n3x - 3 - 0.18x = 12\n$$\n$$\n2.82x = 15 \\implies x = \\frac{15}{2.82} = \\frac{1500}{282} = \\frac{250}{47} \\approx 5.319\n$$\nThen,\n$$\ny = 5 + 0.3\\left(\\frac{250}{47}\\right) = 5 + \\frac{75}{47} = \\frac{235 + 75}{47} = \\frac{310}{47} \\approx 6.596\n$$\nThe unconstrained maximum is at approximately $(5.319, 6.596)$.

This violates the constraint $x + y \\leq 10$.\nSince the unconstrained maximum is outside the feasible region, the constrained maximum must lie on the boundary of the feasible region. The boundary consists of three line segments:\n1. $x + y = 10$, for $x \\in [2, 10]$\n2. $x = 2$, for $y \\in [0, 8]$\n3. $y = 0$, for $x \\in [2, 10]$\n\nWe analyze the function $U(x,y)$ on each of these segments.\n\nCase 1: The boundary $x + y = 10$.\nWe substitute $y = 10 - x$ into $U(x,y)$. The domain for $x$ on this segment is determined by $x \\geq 2$ and $y = 10 - x \\geq 0 \\implies x \\leq 10$.

The candidate point is $(2, 5.6)$.\nThe utility is $U(2, 5.6) = 18 + 11.2(5.6) - (5.6)^2 = 18 + 62.72 - 31.36 = 49.36$.\n\nCase 3: The boundary $y=0$.\nThe domain for $x$ on this segment is $x \\geq 2$ and $x+0 \\leq 10 \\implies x \\leq 10$. So, $x \\in [2,10]$.\nLet $h(x) = U(x,0)$:\n$$\nh(x) = 12x - 1.5x^2\n$$\nTo find the maximum of this concave parabola, we set its derivative to zero:\n$$\nh'(x) = 12 - 3x = 0 \\implies x = 4\n$$\nThis value is within the interval $[2, 10]$.

Let us test this hypothesis.\nAssume the constraints $x_1 \\leq 0.4$ and $x_2 \\leq 0.3$ are active, meaning $x_1 = 0.4$ and $x_2 = 0.3$.\nFrom the budget constraint, $x_3 = 1 - x_1 - x_2 = 1 - 0.4 - 0.3 = 0.3$.\nThe candidate for the optimal solution is $x^* = (0.4, 0.3, 0.3)^\\top$.\n\nWe must check if this point is feasible.\n- Budget: $0.4 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 1$. (Satisfied)\n- Nonnegativity: All components are positive. (Satisfied)\n- Upper bounds: $x_1 = 0.4 \\leq 0.4$, $x_2 = 0.3 \\leq 0.3$, $x_3 = 0.3 \\leq 0.8$. (Satisfied, first two are active)\n- Sector cap: $x_1 + x_3 = 0.4 + 0.3 = 0.7 \\leq 0.75$. (Satisfied)\n- Dispersion limit: $x_1 - x_2 = 0.4 - 0.3 = 0.1 \\leq 0.15$. (Satisfied)\n- Minimum allocation: $x_3 = 0.3 \\geq 0.02$. (Satisfied)\nThe point $x^*$ is primally feasible.\n\nNow, we check for dual feasibility by calculating the Lagrange multipliers. We assume only $\\nu_4$ and $\\nu_5$ are non-zero, corresponding to the active constraints. All other $\\nu_i$ are zero due to complementary slackness.\nThe stationarity conditions become:\n$$ x_1: 0.4 - 1.2 + \\lambda + \\nu_4 = 0 \\implies \\lambda + \\nu_4 = 0.8 $$\n$$ x_2: 0.3 - 1.1 + \\lambda + \\nu_5 = 0 \\implies \\lambda + \\nu_5 = 0.8 $$\n$$ x_3: 0.3 - 0.9 + \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda = 0.6 $$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = 0.6$ into the first two equations:\n$$ 0.6 + \\nu_4 = 0.8 \\implies \\nu_4 = 0.2 $$\n$$ 0.6 + \\nu_5 = 0.8 \\implies \\nu_5 = 0.2 $$\nAll multipliers for active constraints, $\\nu_4$ and $\\nu_5$, are positive. All other multipliers $\\nu_i$ are zero. Thus, the dual feasibility condition ($\\nu_i \\geq 0$) is satisfied. All KKT conditions are met. Since the problem is strictly convex, $x^* = (0.4, 0.3, 0.3)^\\top$ is the unique global optimal solution.\n\nThe final step is to compute the optimal objective value at $x^*$:\n$$ f(x^*) = \\frac{1}{2} ((0.4)^2 + (0.3)^2 + (0.3)^2) - (1.2(0.4) + 1.1(0.3) + 0.9(0.3)) $$\n$$ f(x^*) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.16 + 0.09 + 0.09) - (0.48 + 0.33 + 0.27) $$\n$$ f(x^*) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.34) - (1.08) $$\n$$ f(x^*) = 0.17 - 1.08 = -0.91 $$\nThe optimal objective value is $-0.91$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.91}$$"}]}
