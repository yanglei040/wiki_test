To apply the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, we first state the problem in the canonical form for a minimization problem, which is $\\min f(\\mathbf{z})$ subject to $g_i(\\mathbf{z}) \\le 0$ and $h_j(\\mathbf{z}) = 0$. In this case, we only have inequality constraints.\n\nThe objective function is $f(x, y) = w_{x} x + w_{y} y$.\nThe constraints are:\n$1$. $x \\ge 0$, which we rewrite as $g_1(x, y) = -x \\le 0$.\n$2$. $y \\ge 0$, which we rewrite as $g_2(x, y) = -y \\le 0$.\n$3$. $xy \\ge 1$, which we rewrite as $g_3(x, y) = 1 - xy \\le 0$.\n\nThe prices $w_x$ and $w_y$ are strictly positive, i.e., $w_x > 0$ and $w_y > 0$. The objective function $f(x,y)$ is linear and thus convex. The feasible set defined by the constraints is also a convex set. Therefore, the KKT conditions are both necessary and sufficient for a global minimum.\n\nThe Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ for this problem is formulated by associating a Lagrange multiplier (or KKT multiplier) $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$ with each inequality constraint $g_i(x,y) \\le 0$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) = f(x, y) + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_i g_i(x, y)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) = w_{x} x + w_{y} y - \\lambda_1 x - \\lambda_2 y + \\lambda_3 (1 - xy)\n$$\n\nThe KKT conditions are comprised of stationarity, primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and complementary slackness.\n\n$1$. **Stationarity**: The partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to the decision variables must be zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = w_x - \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_3 y = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} = w_y - \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3 x = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\n\n$2$. **Primal Feasibility**: The original problem constraints must be satisfied.\n$$\n-x \\le 0 \\implies x \\ge 0 \\quad (3)\n$$\n$$\n-y \\le 0 \\implies y \\ge 0 \\quad (4)\n$$\n$$\n1 - xy \\le 0 \\implies xy \\ge 1 \\quad (5)\n$$\n\n$3$. **Dual Feasibility**: The Lagrange multipliers for inequality constraints must be non-negative.\n$$\n\\lambda_1 \\ge 0 \\quad (6)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 \\ge 0 \\quad (7)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_3 \\ge 0 \\quad (8)\n$$\n\n$4$. **Complementary Slackness**: The product of each Lagrange multiplier and its corresponding constraint function must be zero.\n$$\n\\lambda_1 (-x) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_1 x = 0 \\quad (9)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 (-y) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_2 y = 0 \\quad (10)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_3 (1 - xy) = 0 \\quad (11)\n$$\n\nWe now solve this system.
