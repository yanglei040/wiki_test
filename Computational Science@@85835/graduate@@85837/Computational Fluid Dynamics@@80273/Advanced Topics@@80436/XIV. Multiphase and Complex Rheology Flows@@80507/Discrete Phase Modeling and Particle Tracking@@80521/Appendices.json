The forces acting on the particle are those due to its inertia, gravity, buoyancy, added mass, and Stokes drag. The Basset history force is typically neglected in such analyses for simplicity or for long-time behavior, and the heavy-particle assumption further justifies its omission.\n\nNewton's second law for the particle is $m_p \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\sum \\mathbf{F}$, where $m_p$ is the particle mass and $\\mathbf{v}$ is its velocity.

Wall shear force: The shear stress at the wall, $\\tau_{w,0}$, exerts a retarding force on the fluid. This force acts over the surface area $\\pi D L$, so the force is $-\\tau_{w,0} (\\pi D L)$.\n\nThe axial momentum balance is:\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\right) L A - \\rho_f g A L - \\tau_{w,0} \\pi D L = 0 $$\nDividing by the volume $AL = (\\pi D^2/4)L$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} - \\rho_f g - \\frac{\\tau_{w,0} \\pi D}{\\pi D^2/4} = 0 $$\n$$ -\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} + \\rho_f g\\right) - \\frac{4\\tau_{w,0}}{D} = 0 $$\nFor laminar Poiseuille flow, the wall shear stress is related to the mean velocity $u_0$ by $\\tau_{w,0} = 8\\mu u_0/D$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ -\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} + \\rho_f g\\right) - \\frac{4}{D}\\left(\\frac{8\\mu u_0}{D}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{32\\mu u_0}{D^2} = -\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} + \\rho_f g\\right) $$\nThis equation relates the single-phase mean velocity $u_0$ to the imposed pressure gradient and fluid properties. The term $-(\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}z + \\rho_f g)$ represents the effective driving pressure gradient that overcomes viscous friction.\n\n**2. Two-Phase Flow**\n\nNow, we consider the two-phase flow with a uniform particle volume fraction $\\alpha_p$. We perform a momentum balance on the mixture (fluid + particles) within the same control volume.\nThe forces acting on the mixture are:\n1.  Pressure force: The same externally imposed pressure gradient results in a net force $(-\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}z) L A$.\n2.  Gravity force: The total weight of the mixture in the control volume is the sum of the weights of the fluid and particle phases. The volume of the fluid is $(1-\\alpha_p)AL$ and the volume of the particles is $\\alpha_p AL$. The total gravity force is $-[(1-\\alpha_p)\\rho_f + \\alpha_p\\rho_p] g A L$.\n3.  Wall shear force: The shear stress at the wall, $\\tau_w$, acts only on the fluid phase. The problem states to use the laminar Poiseuille law, which relates the wall shear to the mean velocity of the fluid, $u$. Thus, we assume $\\tau_w = 8\\mu u/D$. The resulting force is $-\\tau_w (\\pi D L)$.\n\nThe axial momentum balance for the mixture is:\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\right) L A - [(1-\\alpha_p)\\rho_f + \\alpha_p\\rho_p] g A L - \\tau_w \\pi D L = 0 $$\nThe term for the mixture density can be rewritten as $\\rho_f + \\alpha_p(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)$. Dividing the equation by $AL$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} - [\\rho_f + \\alpha_p(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)] g - \\frac{\\tau_w \\pi D}{A} = 0 $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} - \\rho_f g - \\alpha_p(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)g - \\frac{4\\tau_w}{D} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the relation for wall shear stress, $\\tau_w = 8\\mu u/D$:\n$$ -\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} + \\rho_f g\\right) - \\alpha_p(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)g - \\frac{32\\mu u}{D^2} = 0 $$\nThe term $-(\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}z + \\rho_f g)$ is, from the single-phase analysis, equal to $32\\mu u_0/D^2$. Substituting this into the two-phase equation:\n$$ \\frac{32\\mu u_0}{D^2} - \\alpha_p(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)g - \\frac{32\\mu u}{D^2} = 0 $$\n\n**3. Derivation of Velocity Reduction $\\Delta u$**\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the velocity reduction $\\Delta u = u_0 - u$:\n$$ \\frac{32\\mu}{D^2}(u_0 - u) = \\alpha_p(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)g $$\n$$ \\frac{32\\mu}{D^2}\\Delta u = \\alpha_p(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)g $$\nSolving for $\\Delta u$:\n$$ \\Delta u = \\frac{D^2 g}{32 \\mu} \\alpha_p (\\rho_p - \\rho_f) $$\nThis expression represents the reduction in the mean fluid velocity due to the momentum sink created by the suspended particles. The term $\\alpha_p(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)g$ is the buoyant weight of the particulate phase per unit volume, which constitutes an additional body force that the flow must overcome. For a fixed pressure gradient, this additional load results in a lower mean fluid velocity.\n\n**4.
