This estimate can be based on empirical correlations, analytical solutions for similar flows, or data from previous experiments or simulations.\n$2$. This $\\tau_{w,\\mathrm{est}}$ is used to calculate an initial estimate of the friction velocity, $u_{\\tau,\\mathrm{est}}$.\n$3$. An initial value for $\\Delta y_{1}$ is computed using the derived formula, and a computational mesh is generated.\n$4$. A preliminary simulation is conducted on this mesh. While the near-wall resolution might not be perfectly at the target $y^{+}$, this run provides a much more accurate, flow-specific value for the wall shear stress, $\\tau_{w,\\mathrm{meas}}$.\n$5$. The measured wall shear stress, $\\tau_{w,\\mathrm{meas}}$, is then used to compute an updated and more accurate friction velocity, $u_{\\tau,\\mathrm{upd}}$.
