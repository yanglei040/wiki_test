A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the normalized pressure gradient parameter, $\\alpha(r)$, and then compute its value.\n\n**Derivation of $\\alpha(r)$**\n\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ is a central component of the $s$-$\\alpha$ model for high-toroidal-mode-number ($n \\gg 1$) ballooning stability. It represents the dimensionless pressure gradient driving the instability. Its standard definition is:\n$$ \\alpha(r) = -\\frac{2\\mu_{0} R q(r)^2}{B_0^2} \\frac{dp}{dr} $$\nWe are asked to derive this starting from fundamental principles. The derivation here consists of assembling the definition from its physical components as guided by the problem statement.\n\n1.  The ideal MHD equilibrium condition, $\\nabla p = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$, establishes the background state whose stability is under investigation. In this equilibrium, the outward force from the plasma pressure gradient, $\\nabla p$, is balanced by the inward magnetic force, $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$. For a confined plasma, pressure must decrease outwards, so $\\frac{dp}{dr} < 0$. This pressure gradient is the fundamental thermodynamic free energy source that drives instabilities like the ballooning mode. Thus, $\\alpha$ must be proportional to the pressure gradient. A negative sign is introduced by convention so that $\\alpha$ is positive for a standard pressure profile: $\\alpha \\propto - \\frac{dp}{dr}$.\n\n2.  To make the parameter dimensionless, the pressure gradient must be normalized. A natural quantity for normalization in a magnetized plasma is the magnetic pressure, $p_{mag} = B^2/(2\\mu_0)$. Using the assumption that the field is dominated by the constant toroidal component $B_0$, we normalize by $B_0^2/(2\\mu_0)$.\n\n3.  The problem provides the definition of plasma beta, $\\beta = 2\\mu_0 p / B^2$. Using $B \\approx B_0$, we have $\\beta(r) \\approx 2\\mu_0 p(r) / B_0^2$. The gradient of beta, $\\frac{d\\beta}{dr}$, provides a natural dimensionless pressure gradient:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\beta}{dr} = \\frac{2\\mu_0}{B_0^2} \\frac{dp}{dr} $$\n\n4.  The ballooning mode's stability is critically dependent on the geometry of the magnetic field lines. The instability is driven by the outward centrifugal-like force experienced by the plasma as it follows curved field lines in regions of \"bad curvature\" (e.g., the outboard side of the tokamak). The radius of curvature is approximately the major radius, $R$. Stabilization is provided by the energy required to bend the magnetic field lines. The characteristic length for field line dynamics connecting good and bad curvature regions is the connection length, $L_c \\sim qR$. A full derivation from the MHD energy principle shows that the pressure gradient term is ultimately scaled by a geometric factor of $R q^2$. The $R$ factor relates to the toroidal curvature drive, and the $q^2$ factor arises from the field line bending stabilization (stabilization scales as $1/L_c^2 \\sim 1/(qR)^2$).\n\n5.  Combining these elements, the parameter $\\alpha$ is conventionally defined as $\\alpha = -R q^2 \\frac{d\\beta}{dr}$. Substituting the expression for $\\frac{d\\beta}{dr}$ from step 3 gives the desired form in terms of $\\frac{dp}{dr}$:\n    $$ \\alpha(r) = -R q(r)^2 \\left( \\frac{2\\mu_0}{B_0^2} \\frac{dp}{dr} \\right) = -\\frac{2\\mu_0 R q(r)^2}{B_0^2} \\frac{dp}{dr} $$\nThis expression connects the pressure gradient, normalized by magnetic pressure, with the crucial geometric factors of the tokamak configuration.\n\n**Calculation of $\\alpha$ at $r=0.7\\,\\mathrm{m}$**\n\nFirst, we compute the pressure gradient, $\\frac{dp}{dr}$, from the given pressure profile $p(r)=10^{5}\\,(1-r^{2})$.\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ 10^5 (1-r^2) \\right] = 10^5 (-2r) = -2 \\times 10^5 r $$\nAt the specified minor radius $r=0.7\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{dp}{dr} \\right|_{r=0.7} = -2 \\times 10^5 \\times 0.7 = -1.4 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{Pa/m} $$\n\nNow, we substitute all the given numerical values into the derived expression for $\\alpha$.\n-   $R = 3\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $q = 2$\n-   $B_0 = 5\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n-   $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{T \\cdot m / A}$ (or $\\mathrm{N/A^2}$)\n-   $\\frac{dp}{dr} = -1.4 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{Pa/m}$\n\n$$ \\alpha(0.7) = -\\frac{2\\mu_{0} R q^2}{B_0^2} \\left. \\frac{dp}{dr} \\right|_{r=0.7} $$\n$$ \\alpha(0.7) = -\\frac{2 \\times (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 3 \\times (2^2)}{(5^2)} \\times (-1.4 \\times 10^5) $$\n$$ \\alpha(0.7) = \\frac{2 \\times 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 3 \\times 4}{25} \\times 1.4 \\times 10^5 $$\n$$ \\alpha(0.7) = \\frac{96\\pi \\times 1.4}{25} \\times 10^{-7} \\times 10^5 $$\n$$ \\alpha(0.7) = \\frac{134.4 \\pi}{25} \\times 10^{-2} $$\n$$ \\alpha(0.7) = 5.376 \\pi \\times 10^{-2} \\approx 0.05376 \\times 3.14159265... $$\n$$ \\alpha(0.7) \\approx 0.16889... $$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$ \\alpha(0.7) \\approx 0.169 $$\n\nAs a brief interpretation, the critical value for the onset of ideal ballooning modes, $\\alpha_c$, is typically of order the magnetic shear $s = (r/q)dq/dr$. For moderate shear values ($s \\sim 0.5$ to $1.5$), the stability threshold is roughly $\\alpha_c \\approx 0.8s$.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and values to compute the requested quantity. There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The values given for the magnetic shear ($s=1$) and the pressure gradient parameter ($\\alpha=2$) are physically realistic. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the ratio $\\mathcal{R}(\\theta)$ evaluated at the outboard midplane, which corresponds to $\\theta = 0$.

The square of the parallel wavenumber is:\n$$\nk_{\\parallel}^2(\\theta) \\approx \\left( \\frac{s\\,\\theta\\,k_{\\alpha}}{q R_0} \\right)^2 = \\frac{s^2\\,\\theta^2\\,k_{\\alpha}^2}{(q R_0)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathcal{R}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{\\left( \\frac{s^2\\,\\theta^2\\,k_{\\alpha}^2}{(q R_0)^2} \\right) v_A^2}{|\\alpha|\\,v_A^2/(q R_0)^2 \\, |\\cos\\theta|}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling common terms. The terms $v_A^2$ and $(q R_0)^2$ appear in both the numerator (from the expansion of $k_{\\parallel}^2$) and the denominator.

Our calculation of $\\mathcal{R}(0) = 0$ provides the answer. The value of $\\mathcal{R}(\\theta)$ represents the ratio of the line-bending restoring term to the curvature drive. A value of $0$ signifies that the line-bending term is exactly zero at this location. This is a fundamental aspect of ballooning modes: the mode is structured to minimize field line bending at the location where the destabilizing drive is strongest. At the outboard midplane ($\\theta=0$), the magnetic curvature is unfavorable (destabilizing) and maximized. The ballooning mode aligns itself such that its effective parallel wavenumber $k_{\\parallel}$ is zero at this point. Consequently, the stabilizing line-bending term, which scales as $k_{\\parallel}^2$, vanishes. Since the stabilizing term is zero while the destabilizing drive is maximal, the line-bending term provides no opposition to the instability drive *at the point* $\\theta=0$.
