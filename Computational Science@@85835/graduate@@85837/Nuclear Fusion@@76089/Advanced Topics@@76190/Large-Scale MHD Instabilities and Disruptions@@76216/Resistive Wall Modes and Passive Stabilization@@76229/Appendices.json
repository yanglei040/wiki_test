The provided values are physically plausible for a laboratory-scale fusion experiment undergoing a small-amplitude perturbation. The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. There are no violations of scientific principles, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Theoretical Explanation and Solution**\n\nAccording to the ideal MHD energy principle, the stability of a plasma equilibrium against a small fluid displacement $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(\\mathbf{r})$ is determined by the sign of the change in the total potential energy, $\\Delta$. For a system comprising a plasma core surrounded by a vacuum region, this energy change is typically decomposed as:\n$$ \\Delta = \\delta W_{\\text{plasma}} + \\delta W_{\\text{vac}} $$\nwhere $\\delta W_{\\text{plasma}}$ is the potential energy change within the plasma volume and $\\delta W_{\\text{vac}}$ is the change in magnetic energy in the vacuum region.\n\n- The term $\\delta W_{\\text{plasma}}$ accounts for the work done to perturb the plasma fluid and its embedded magnetic field. A negative $\\delta W_{\\text{plasma}}$ indicates that the plasma configuration possesses free energy that can be released, thus driving an instability.\n- The term $\\delta W_{\\text{vac}}$ represents the energy stored in the perturbed magnetic field in the vacuum region. This term is inherently stabilizing, i.e., $\\delta W_{\\text{vac}} \\ge 0$.\n\nThe stability of an external kink mode, which is driven by the plasma current gradient near the edge, is sensitive to boundary conditions.\n1.  **No Wall:** With the vacuum extending to infinity, the mode is unstable if $\\delta W_{\\text{plasma}} + \\delta W_{\\text{vac},\\infty}  0$.\n2.  **Perfectly Conducting Wall:** If a perfectly conducting wall is placed at a certain radius, it prevents the magnetic field from passing through it. This imposes a stricter boundary condition, modifying the vacuum energy term to $\\delta W_{\\text{vac,ideal}}$. The induced eddy currents in the wall are perfectly out of phase with the mode and provide a strong stabilizing effect, such that $\\delta W_{\\text{vac,ideal}}  \\delta W_{\\text{vac},\\infty}$. The system is stable if $\\delta W_{\\text{plasma}} + \\delta W_{\\text{vac,ideal}}  0$. It is possible for a mode to be unstable with no wall but stable with a perfectly conducting wall.\n\n3.  **Resistive Wall:** A wall with finite conductivity, as described in this problem, represents an intermediate case. It cannot perfectly shield the perturbed magnetic field. The field can slowly diffuse through the wall on a characteristic resistive time scale, $\\tau_w$. This has two main consequences:\n    a. The stabilizing eddy currents induced in the wall are no longer perfectly shielding and will decay, dissipating energy as heat.\n    b. This field penetration weakens the stabilizing effect of the wall.\n\nThe problem simplifies this complex, time-dependent process by providing a static \"resistive wall correction\" term. This term represents the modification to the system's potential energy due to the wall's finite conductivity, relative to the ideal-wall case. The total potential energy change $\\Delta$ for the RWM is therefore the sum of all specified contributions. The term $\\delta W_{\\text{vac}}$ given in the problem is best interpreted as the stabilizing vacuum energy in the presence of an idealized wall, and the \"resistive wall correction\" is the destabilizing modification due to non-ideal effects.\n\nThe total potential energy change is the sum of these three components:\n$$ \\Delta = \\delta W_{\\text{plasma}} + \\delta W_{\\text{vac}} + \\delta W_{\\text{wall\\_corr}} $$\nHere, $\\delta W_{\\text{wall\\_corr}}$ is the term given as the \"resistive wall correction\".\n\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n- $\\delta W_{\\text{plasma}} = -0.2\\,\\text{J}$: The plasma itself is unstable and provides the drive for the mode.\n- $\\delta W_{\\text{vac}} = 0.25\\,\\text{J}$: The magnetic field distortion in the vacuum and the ideal wall response provide a stabilizing effect. Without the resistive correction, the net energy change would be $-0.2\\,\\text{J} + 0.25\\,\\text{J} = 0.05\\,\\text{J}$, indicating stability. The configuration is stable with an ideal wall.\n- $\\delta W_{\\text{wall\\_corr}} = -0.1\\,\\text{J}$: The finite resistivity of the wall introduces a destabilizing effect, reducing the overall stability of the system.\n\nWe can now compute the total potential energy change $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = (-0.2 \\, \\text{J}) + (0.25 \\, \\text{J}) + (-0.1 \\, \\text{J}) $$\n$$ \\Delta = (0.25 - 0.2 - 0.1) \\, \\text{J} $$\n$$ \\Delta = (0.05 - 0.1) \\, \\text{J} $$\n$$ \\Delta = -0.05 \\, \\text{J} $$\n\nSince $\\Delta = -0.05\\,\\text{J}$, which is less than zero, the system is unstable to this Resistive Wall Mode. The destabilizing effect of the wall's resistivity is sufficient to overcome the stabilizing effect of the vacuum field, leading to a net negative potential energy change and thus, instability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.05}\n$$", "id": "3716882"}, {"introduction": "Building on the energy principle, we now investigate how the stabilizing effect of the wall depends on its physical properties. This practice uses scaling arguments, derived from fundamental circuit analogies and dimensional reasoning, to connect engineering parameters—wall conductivity $\\sigma$ and thickness $d$—to the characteristic resistive wall time $\\tau_w$ and the RWM growth rate $\\gamma$.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the scalings and compute the final values.\n\nThe problem can be addressed in three parts: first, deriving the scaling of the resistive wall time $\\tau_w$; second, deducing the scaling of the RWM growth rate $\\gamma$ with $\\tau_w$; and third, calculating the numerical change in these quantities.\n\nPart 1: Scaling of the resistive wall time $\\tau_w$\n\nWe are asked to model the thin conducting shell as an $L$-$R$ circuit. The behavior of such a circuit is governed by the equation:\n$$L \\frac{dI}{dt} + IR = V_{ext}$$\nwhere $I$ is the current, $L$ is the inductance, $R$ is the resistance, and $V_{ext}$ is any external voltage source. For the decay of eddy currents induced in the wall in the absence of an external drive, $V_{ext} = 0$, so the equation becomes:\n$$L \\frac{dI}{dt} + IR = 0$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. Its solution is an exponential decay of the form $I(t) = I_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau_w)$, where the characteristic time constant $\\tau_w$ is given by:\n$$\\tau_w = \\frac{L}{R}$$\nThe problem states that the inductance $L$ is a geometric property of the shell and the plasma. It depends on the size and shape of the torus and the current paths, but it is independent of the wall's material properties, namely the conductivity $\\sigma$ and thickness $d$. Thus, $L$ is treated as a constant factor for a fixed geometry.\n\nThe resistance $R$ of the eddy current path depends on the material's resistivity $\\rho_e = 1/\\sigma$ and the geometry of the current path. For a thin shell of thickness $d$, the relevant quantity is the sheet resistance, $R_{sheet} = \\rho_e/d = 1/(\\sigma d)$. The total resistance of the current path is proportional to this sheet resistance, with the proportionality constant depending on the geometry of the path (e.g., its length and width). Therefore, we have the scaling:\n$$R \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sigma d}$$\nSubstituting the scalings for $L$ and $R$ into the expression for $\\tau_w$:\n$$\\tau_w = \\frac{L}{R} \\propto \\frac{\\text{constant}}{1/(\\sigma d)} \\propto \\sigma d$$\nThis confirms that the resistive wall time $\\tau_w$ is directly proportional to the product of the wall conductivity and thickness, $\\sigma d$, with the proportionality constant being a geometry-dependent factor related to the inductance and the shape of the current path.\n\nPart 2: Scaling of the RWM growth rate $\\gamma$\n\nWe are asked to deduce the scaling of the RWM growth rate $\\gamma$ with $\\tau_w$ using dimensional reasoning and the key assumption that the wall provides the only slow timescale in the system. All other plasma dynamics, such as ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena, occur on the much faster Alfvén timescale, $\\tau_A$. The RWM exists in a regime where the plasma would be unstable without a wall, but is stable with a perfectly conducting wall. The mode's growth is permitted only by the finite resistivity of the wall, which allows magnetic flux to slowly leak through it.\n\nThe growth rate $\\gamma$ must be determined by a dispersion relation $\\mathcal{D}(\\gamma, \\text{system parameters}) = 0$. The system parameters include the slow wall time $\\tau_w$, the fast Alfvén time $\\tau_A$, and terms representing the plasma's potential energy (which are taken as fixed). For the RWM, the growth rate is very slow compared to the Alfvén frequency, so $\\gamma \\tau_A \\ll 1$. Furthermore, the mode is in the \"slow, wall-limited regime,\" which implies that the growth is much slower than the wall's magnetic diffusion rate, so $\\gamma \\tau_w \\ll 1$.\n\nGiven these timescale separations, the dispersion relation can be analyzed by considering dimensionless quantities. The physically relevant dimensionless products that can be formed are $\\gamma \\tau_w$ and $\\gamma \\tau_A$. The dispersion relation takes the general form:\n$$f(\\gamma \\tau_w, \\gamma \\tau_A, \\text{fixed plasma parameters}) = 0$$\nSince $\\gamma \\tau_A \\ll 1$, we can approximate the plasma response as being instantaneous (the $\\gamma \\tau_A \\to 0$ limit). The dispersion relation simplifies to a function of the single slow dimensionless parameter $\\gamma \\tau_w$:\n$$g(\\gamma \\tau_w, \\text{fixed plasma parameters}) = 0$$\nSince all plasma parameters are held constant, the solution to this equation must be that the argument itself is a constant:\n$$\\gamma \\tau_w = C$$\nwhere the constant $C$ depends only on the fixed ideal MHD properties of the plasma configuration. This relationship is a cornerstone of RWM theory. It demonstrates that the growth rate is inversely proportional to the resistive wall time:\n$$\\gamma \\propto \\frac{1}{\\tau_w}$$\nThis scaling has a clear physical interpretation: a \"better\" wall (more conducting, larger $\\sigma d$, thus larger $\\tau_w$) provides stronger stabilization and slows down the instability, resulting in a smaller growth rate $\\gamma$.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of changes in $\\tau_w$ and $\\gamma$\n\nWe are given the following changes in material properties:\nThe conductivity is reduced by a factor of $5$: $\\sigma' = \\sigma/5$.\nThe thickness is increased by a factor of $3$: $d' = 3d$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the new resistive wall time, $\\tau_w'$, using the scaling $\\tau_w \\propto \\sigma d$.\nThe ratio of the new wall time to the old wall time is:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_w'}{\\tau_w} = \\frac{\\sigma' d'}{\\sigma d} = \\frac{(\\sigma/5)(3d)}{\\sigma d} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\nSo, the new wall time is $3/5$ of the original value.\n\nNext, we calculate the new RWM growth rate, $\\gamma'$, using the scaling $\\gamma \\propto 1/\\tau_w$.\nThe ratio of the new growth rate to the old growth rate is:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma'}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1/\\tau_w'}{1/\\tau_w} = \\frac{\\tau_w}{\\tau_w'} = \\frac{1}{3/5} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\nSo, the new growth rate is $5/3$ of the original value. The less-conducting wall (the product $\\sigma d$ is smaller) leads to a faster-growing instability.\n\nThe multiplicative changes are $\\tau_w'/\\tau_w = 3/5$ and $\\gamma'/\\gamma = 5/3$.
