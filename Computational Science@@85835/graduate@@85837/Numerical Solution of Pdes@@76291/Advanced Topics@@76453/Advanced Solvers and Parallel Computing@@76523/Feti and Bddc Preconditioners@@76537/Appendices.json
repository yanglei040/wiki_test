This defines two linear finite elements. The domain $\\Omega=[0,2]$ is partitioned into two non-overlapping subdomains, $\\Omega_1 = [0,1]$ and $\\Omega_2 = [1,2]$, which coincide with the two finite elements. The node at $x_1=1$ is the interface between the subdomains.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Assembly of Local Stiffness Matrices**\n\nWe first define the piecewise-linear basis functions and then compute the stiffness matrix for each subdomain (element).\n\n**For Subdomain $\\Omega_1 = [0,1]$:**\nThe local nodes are $x_0=0$ and $x_1=1$. The corresponding continuous, piecewise-linear basis functions restricted to $\\Omega_1$ are:\n- $\\phi_0^{(1)}(x) = 1-x$, which is $1$ at $x_0=0$ and $0$ at $x_1=1$.\n- $\\phi_1^{(1)}(x) = x$, which is $0$ at $x_0=0$ and $1$ at $x_1=1$.\n\nThe local stiffness matrix, denoted $K^{(1)}$, is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix whose entries are given by $K_{ij}^{(1)} = \\int_0^1 (\\phi_j^{(1)})'(x) (\\phi_i^{(1)})'(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$ for $i,j \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\nThe derivatives of the basis functions are:\n- $(\\phi_0^{(1)})'(x) = -1$.\n- $(\\phi_1^{(1)})'(x) = 1$.\n\nWe compute the entries of $K^{(1)}$:\n$K_{00}^{(1)} = \\int_0^1 (-1)(-1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^1 1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1$.\n$K_{01}^{(1)} = \\int_0^1 (-1)(1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^1 -1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = -1$.\n$K_{10}^{(1)} = \\int_0^1 (1)(-1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^1 -1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = -1$.\n$K_{11}^{(1)} = \\int_0^1 (1)(1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^1 1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1$.\n\nThus, the local stiffness matrix for $\\Omega_1$ is:\n$$ K^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**For Subdomain $\\Omega_2 = [1,2]$:**\nThe local nodes are $x_1=1$ and $x_2=2$. The basis functions restricted to $\\Omega_2$ are:\n- $\\phi_1^{(2)}(x) = 2-x$, which is $1$ at $x_1=1$ and $0$ at $x_2=2$.\n- $\\phi_2^{(2)}(x) = x-1$, which is $0$ at $x_1=1$ and $1$ at $x_2=2$.\n\nThe local stiffness matrix, $K^{(2)}$, has entries $K_{ij}^{(2)} = \\int_1^2 (\\phi_j^{(2)})'(x) (\\phi_i^{(2)})'(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$ where the indices $i,j$ correspond to the global node numbers $\\{1,2\\}$.\nThe derivatives are:\n- $(\\phi_1^{(2)})'(x) = -1$.\n- $(\\phi_2^{(2)})'(x) = 1$.\n\nWe compute the entries of $K^{(2)}$:\n$K_{11}^{(2)} = \\int_1^2 (-1)(-1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_1^2 1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1$.\n$K_{12}^{(2)} = \\int_1^2 (-1)(1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_1^2 -1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = -1$.\n$K_{21}^{(2)} = \\int_1^2 (1)(-1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_1^2 -1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = -1$.\n$K_{22}^{(2)} = \\int_1^2 (1)(1) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_1^2 1 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1$.\n\nThus, the local stiffness matrix for $\\Omega_2$, indexed by nodes $1$ and $2$, is:\n$$ K^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**2. Condensation and Local Schur Complements**\n\nThe next step is to obtain the subdomain Schur complements. The Schur complement system is the system for the interface degrees of freedom (DOFs) after eliminating all other DOFs within the subdomain. Here, the \"other\" DOFs are those on the external Dirichlet boundary.\n\n**For Subdomain $\\Omega_1 = [0,1]$:**\nThe local finite element system is $K^{(1)} \\mathbf{u}^{(1)} = \\mathbf{F}^{(1)}$, where $\\mathbf{u}^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_0 \\\\ u_1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The DOF $u_0$ is on the external boundary $\\Gamma_D$, while $u_1$ is on the interface. We impose the homogeneous Dirichlet condition $u_0=0$.\nThe system of equations is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_0 \\\\ u_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_0^{(1)} \\\\ F_1^{(1)} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSetting $u_0=0$, the system becomes:\n$ -u_1 = F_0^{(1)} $\n$  u_1 = F_1^{(1)} $\nThe second equation relates the interface DOF $u_1$ to the corresponding force component $F_1^{(1)}$. This equation is the condensed system for the interface. The operator mapping $u_1$ to the condensed force is a scalar. This scalar is the local Schur complement for $\\Omega_1$, denoted $S^{(1)}$.\nFrom the equation $1 \\cdot u_1 = F_1^{(1)}$, we identify:\n$$ S^{(1)} = 1 $$\nThis scalar can be interpreted as the discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for $\\Omega_1$, which maps the Dirichlet value $u_1$ at the interface to the resulting flux (represented by the nodal force $F_1^{(1)}$).\n\n**For Subdomain $\\Omega_2 = [1,2]$:**\nThe local system is $K^{(2)} \\mathbf{u}^{(2)} = \\mathbf{F}^{(2)}$, where $\\mathbf{u}^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Here, $u_1$ is the interface DOF and $u_2$ is the external boundary DOF. We impose the condition $u_2=0$.\nThe system of equations is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_1^{(2)} \\\\ F_2^{(2)} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSetting $u_2=0$, we get:\n$  u_1 = F_1^{(2)} $\n$ -u_1 = F_2^{(2)} $\nThe first equation, $1 \\cdot u_1 = F_1^{(2)}$, is the condensed system for the interface DOF $u_1$ arising from $\\Omega_2$. The local Schur complement for $\\Omega_2$, denoted $S^{(2)}$, is:\n$$ S^{(2)} = 1 $$\n\n**3. Global Interface Schur Complement**\n\nIn FETI and BDDC methods, the global interface problem is constructed by assembling the contributions from each subdomain. The global interface Schur complement, $S$, is the sum of the local Schur complements $S^{(k)}$. The interface consists of a single point $x=1$ with a single DOF $u_1$. Therefore, the global Schur complement is a scalar.\n$$ S = S^{(1)} + S^{(2)} $$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$ S = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\n\nTo verify, we can consider the fully assembled global stiffness matrix for the entire domain $[0,2]$ before applying boundary conditions. The global nodes are $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$, and the matrix $K$ is formed by assembling $K^{(1)}$ and $K^{(2)}$:\n$$ K = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1+1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe global system is $K \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{F}$, with $\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_0 \\\\ u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Applying the Dirichlet boundary conditions $u_0=0$ and $u_2=0$, we are left with the equation for the single unknown interface DOF $u_1$, which is the second row of the system:\n$$ -1(u_0) + 2(u_1) -1(u_2) = F_1 $$\n$$ -1(0) + 2(u_1) -1(0) = F_1 $$\n$$ 2 u_1 = F_1 $$\nThe matrix of this reduced system for the interface unknowns is simply the scalar $2$, which confirms our result for the global interface Schur complement.\n\nThe global interface Schur complement is the scalar value $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3391845"}, {"introduction": "Once the independent subdomain problems are defined, the \"Tearing and Interconnecting\" philosophy requires us to \"glue\" them back together.
