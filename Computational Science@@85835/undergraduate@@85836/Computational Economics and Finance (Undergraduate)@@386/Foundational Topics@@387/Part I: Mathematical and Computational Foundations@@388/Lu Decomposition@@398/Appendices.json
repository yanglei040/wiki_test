The specified method is via LU decomposition with partial pivoting. This factorization has the form $P A = L U$, where $P$ is a permutation matrix that encodes row interchanges, $L$ is a unit lower-triangular matrix, and $U$ is an upper-triangular matrix.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n$1$. Start with the system $A x = b$.\n$2$. Premultiply by the permutation matrix $P$ to get $P A x = P b$.\n$3$. Substitute the factorization $P A = L U$ into the equation: $L U x = P b$.\n$4$. This equation is solved in a two-stage process. First, define an intermediate vector $y = U x$. The system becomes $L y = P b$.\n$5$. Solve for $y$. Since $L$ is a lower-triangular matrix, this system can be solved efficiently using forward substitution. The elements of $y$ are computed sequentially:\n$$y_i = ( (P b)_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} L_{ij} y_j ) / L_{ii}$$\nSince $L$ is unit lower-triangular, $L_{ii} = 1$ for all $i$.\n\n$6$. Once $y$ is determined, solve the system $U x = y$ for the final solution vector $x$. Since $U$ is an upper-triangular matrix, this is solved efficiently using backward substitution. The elements of $x$ are computed in reverse order:\n$$x_i = ( y_i - \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} U_{ij} x_j ) / U_{ii}$$\n\nThe use of partial pivoting (the $P$ matrix) is essential for numerical stability. It ensures that when performing Gaussian elimination to find the factors $L$ and $U$, the pivot element (the diagonal element $U_{kk}$) is the largest in its column (below the diagonal). This mitigates the amplification of rounding errors, which is particularly critical for ill-conditioned systems, such as the one presented in Case $2$.\n\nFor Case $2$, the matrix $A_2$ is severely ill-conditioned. Standard double-precision floating-point arithmetic (e.g., `float64`) may be insufficient to resolve the solution accurately, even with pivoting. Catastrophic cancellation can occur, leading to a computed solution with a large residual error. A rigorous approach requires higher-precision arithmetic to obtain the correct result. This demonstrates a fundamental principle of numerical analysis: the interplay between algorithm stability, machine precision, and problem conditioning.\n\nFor Case $3$, the matrix $A_3$ is diagonally dominant. Such matrices are inherently well-behaved, and LU decomposition is a very stable and efficient method for them.\n\nThe implementation will use a standard numerical library that provides robust functions for LU factorization with pivoting and for solving the resulting triangular systems. This directly maps to the theoretical procedure described.
