The aim is to maximize the detectability of the Si–H stretch while minimizing spectral artifacts and interferences. Three generic sample preparation modes are available: neat (film), potassium bromide (KBr) pellet, and solution. The choice must account for the following foundational considerations: the Beer–Lambert law, volatility and retention of analyte during measurement, solvent transparency in the target wavenumber region, and chemical compatibility with sampling media (including window materials and salts). The silane is moisture-sensitive and can undergo hydrolysis to produce silicon–oxygen (Si–O) functionalities.

Solvents have characteristic absorption bands.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria:\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of analytical chemistry, specifically infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The properties attributed to the analyte (a tertiary silane being volatile and moisture-sensitive) are chemically accurate. The wavenumber range for the Si–H stretch is correct. The principles of sample preparation (neat films, KBr pellets, solution cells), the properties of common IR window materials (KBr, $\\mathrm{CaF_2}$, NaCl) and solvents ($\\mathrm{CCl_4}$, $\\mathrm{CH_3CN}$, $\\mathrm{CH_3OH}$), and the Beer–Lambert law are all standard, factual concepts in spectroscopy. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for the \"most appropriate\" set of conditions from a given list of choices. It provides sufficient, relevant information about the analyte's physical and chemical properties to perform a rigorous comparative analysis of the options. A single best answer can be determined by applying established spectroscopic and chemical principles.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical and precise. The criteria for success (maximize detectability, suppress artifacts) are objective and directly related to the quality of an IR spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe optimal experimental design must address three primary characteristics of the analyte, $R_3\\mathrm{SiH}$: its volatility, its moisture sensitivity, and its spectroscopic properties.\n\n1.  **Volatility**: The analyte is a volatile liquid. This property strongly disfavors methods that involve open systems or long preparation times during which the sample can evaporate.\n    -   A neat film on an open plate will evaporate quickly, leading to a non-reproducible and decreasing signal.\n    -   Preparing a KBr pellet requires grinding a sample with KBr powder and pressing the mixture into a disc. A volatile liquid would evaporate almost completely during this process, resulting in little to no analyte in the final pellet.\n    -   The correct method for a volatile liquid is to use a sealed sample holder, such as a sealed liquid cell, to contain the vapor and maintain a constant concentration.\n\n2.  **Moisture Sensitivity**: The silane $R_3\\mathrm{SiH}$ reacts with water ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$), likely via hydrolysis, to form species containing Si–O bonds (e.g., silanols, $\\mathrm{R_3SiOH}$, and siloxanes, $(\\mathrm{R_3Si})_2\\mathrm{O}$). This reaction would consume the analyte, diminishing the target Si–H band, and introduce new, interfering bands (e.g., a broad O–H stretch from the silanol around $3200-3600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and strong Si–O stretches around $1000-1100\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). Therefore, exposure to atmospheric moisture must be rigorously avoided.\n    -   Any procedure conducted in \"ambient laboratory air\" is unacceptable. The spectrometer and sample compartment should be purged with a dry, inert gas (e.g., $\\mathrm{N_2}$ or Ar) to displace water vapor and $\\mathrm{CO_2}$.\n    -   Window materials must be chosen carefully. Salts like potassium bromide (KBr) and sodium chloride (NaCl) are hygroscopic, meaning they readily absorb atmospheric moisture, which would then be available to react with the sample. Non-hygroscopic materials, such as calcium fluoride ($\\mathrm{CaF_2}$) or zinc selenide (ZnSe), are strongly preferred.\n    -   Solvents must be aprotic and rigorously dried before use. Protic solvents like methanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3OH}$) would react directly with the silane.\n\n3.  **Spectroscopic Considerations**: The goal is to clearly detect the Si–H stretch at $2100-2200\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   The chosen solvent must be transparent in this region.\n    -   According to the Beer–Lambert law, $A = \\epsilon c l$, where $A$ is absorbance, $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, $c$ is the concentration, and $l$ is the path length. The parameters $c$ and $l$ must be chosen to yield an absorbance in the optimal range (typically $A \\approx 0.1-1.0$) to maximize signal-to-noise without saturating the detector.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Press the $R_3\\mathrm{SiH}$ into a potassium bromide (KBr) pellet and record the mid-IR spectrum in ambient laboratory air without purging.**\nThis method is flawed for several reasons. First, the analyte is volatile and would evaporate during the grinding and pressing of the pellet. Second, KBr is hygroscopic and the preparation is done in ambient air, guaranteeing the presence of water, which will hydrolyze the silane. Third, recording without purging introduces interfering absorptions from atmospheric $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ and $\\mathrm{CO_2}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Record a neat film of $R_3\\mathrm{SiH}$ between hygroscopic KBr windows in an open, unsealed configuration at room temperature.**\nThis method is also deeply flawed. The \"open, unsealed configuration\" will allow the volatile silane to evaporate rapidly. The use of \"hygroscopic KBr windows\" in an open system will introduce moisture, leading to sample decomposition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Prepare a sealed short-path liquid cell with calcium fluoride ($\\mathrm{CaF_2}$) windows of path length $l = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, dissolve $R_3\\mathrm{SiH}$ in carbon tetrachloride ($\\mathrm{CCl_4}$) to $c \\approx 0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$, and purge the instrument and sample compartment with dry nitrogen before acquisition.**\nThis option systematically addresses all of the challenges.\n-   **Volatility**: A \"sealed short-path liquid cell\" prevents evaporation of the volatile analyte.\n-   **Moisture Sensitivity**: \"$\\mathrm{CaF_2}$ windows\" are non-hygroscopic. Carbon tetrachloride ($\\mathrm{CCl_4}$) is an aprotic (non-reactive) solvent. Purging with \"dry nitrogen\" removes atmospheric moisture.\n-   **Spectroscopic Clarity**: $\\mathrm{CCl_4}$ is a standard IR solvent with excellent transparency in the $2100-2200\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ region.\n-   **Beer-Lambert Law**: A path length of $l = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and concentration of $c \\approx 0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$ are standard parameters that are highly likely to produce a well-defined peak with an absorbance in the optimal range.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Prepare a $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ path length solution cell in ambient air using acetonitrile ($\\mathrm{CH_3CN}$) as solvent at $c \\approx 0.50\\,\\mathrm{M}$.**\nThis method has multiple serious flaws. Preparation \"in ambient air\" will introduce moisture and lead to hydrolysis. Acetonitrile ($\\mathrm{CH_3CN}$) has a $C\\equiv N$ stretching vibration near $2250\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which is close to the region of interest and could cause interference. Most critically, the combination of a very long path length ($l = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and a high concentration ($c \\approx 0.50\\,\\mathrm{M}$) will almost certainly lead to total absorption (saturation) of the Si–H band, making its useful observation impossible. The product $c \\cdot l$ is $50$ times greater than in option C.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Dissolve $R_3\\mathrm{SiH}$ in methanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3OH}$) and record the spectrum on sodium chloride ($\\mathrm{NaCl}$) windows open to ambient air, using a path length $l = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\nThis is the worst option. Methanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3OH}$) is a protic solvent that will react with and destroy the silane ($R_3\\mathrm{SiH} + \\mathrm{CH_3OH} \\rightarrow R_3\\mathrm{SiOCH_3} + \\mathrm{H_2}$). NaCl windows are hygroscopic, and the \"open to ambient air\" setup ensures the presence of water, which will also cause hydrolysis. The analyte will not survive the sample preparation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "3718148"}, {"introduction": "Beyond qualitative identification, spectroscopy serves as a precise quantitative tool.

The relationship between absorbance, concentration, and path length in a non-scattering medium is governed by the Beer-Lambert Law.\n\nThe Beer-Lambert Law states that absorbance, $A$, is directly proportional to the concentration, $c$, of the analyte and the path length, $l$, of the sample cell.

Let's call them $k_{eff,1}$ and $k_{eff,2}$.\nThe first normal mode has an effective force constant $k_{eff,1} = k$. This corresponds to the symmetric stretch where $x_1 = x_2$, so the coupling term $\\frac{1}{2}k'(x_1-x_2)^2$ is zero and the oscillators vibrate as if uncoupled.\nThe second normal mode has an effective force constant $k_{eff,2} = k+2k'$. This corresponds to the asymmetric stretch where $x_1 = -x_2$.\n\nThe wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ of a harmonic oscillator is related to its effective force constant $k_{eff}$ and reduced mass $\\mu$ by:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff}}{\\mu}}$$\nThe monomer wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$ corresponds to the uncoupled oscillator, so:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$$\nThe two normal modes of the dimer will have wavenumbers:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,1}}{\\mu}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{eff,2}}{\\mu}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k+2k'}{\\mu}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the dimer exhibits two bands separated by $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$. Based on our model, one band is at $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$ and the other is shifted. The splitting $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$ is the difference between these two wavenumbers. Since $k' > 0$, we have $\\tilde{\\nu}_2 > \\tilde{\\nu}_1$.\n$$\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = \\tilde{\\nu}_2 - \\tilde{\\nu}_1 = \\tilde{\\nu}_2 - \\tilde{\\nu}_0$$\nSo, $\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_2$:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k+2k'}{\\mu}}$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$(\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 = \\frac{k+2k'}{(2\\pi c)^2 \\mu}$$\nWe can also square the equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$ to find an expression for $k$:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_0^2 = \\frac{k}{(2\\pi c)^2 \\mu} \\implies k = \\mu (2\\pi c \\tilde{\\nu}_0)^2$$\nNow, rearrange the equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}_2$ to solve for $k'$:\n$$k+2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2$$\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 - k$$\nSubstitute the expression for $k$:\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 - \\mu (2\\pi c \\tilde{\\nu}_0)^2$$\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 [(\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 - \\tilde{\\nu}_0^2]$$\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 [\\tilde{\\nu}_0^2 + 2\\tilde{\\nu}_0 \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} + (\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2 - \\tilde{\\nu}_0^2]$$\n$$2k' = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 [2\\tilde{\\nu}_0 \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} + (\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2]$$\n$$k' = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 (2\\tilde{\\nu}_0 \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} + (\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu})^2) = \\mu (2\\pi c)^2 \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu} \\left(\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}\\right)$$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass $\\mu$ of the Si–H oscillator.\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Si}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{Si}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{(28.0855\\,\\mathrm{u}) (1.00784\\,\\mathrm{u})}{28.0855\\,\\mathrm{u} + 1.00784\\,\\mathrm{u}} = \\frac{28.30619384}{29.09334}\\,\\mathrm{u} \\approx 0.972942155\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\nConverting to kilograms:\n$$\\mu = 0.972942155\\,\\mathrm{u} \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{u} \\approx 1.61580103 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\n\nNow, substitute the given values into the derived expression for $k'$.
