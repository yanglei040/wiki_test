The exchange occurs on a microsecond to millisecond timescale, and the transverse magnetization experiences precession at angular frequencies $\\omega_A$ and $\\omega_B$ in the two environments, with equilibrium populations $p_A$ and $p_B$ satisfying $p_A + p_B = 1$. The total exchange rate is $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, defined as the sum of forward and backward rates. Within the framework of the Bloch equations augmented by exchange (the Bloch–McConnell description for two-site exchange), the observed resonance in the fast-exchange limit is governed by the collective mode of the coupled magnetization dynamics. Starting from the linear two-pool exchange description and the principle of detailed balance for the exchange rates, derive the leading-order expression for the observed resonance angular frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ in the fast-exchange limit as an asymptotic result in the small parameter defined by the ratio of the angular frequency separation to the exchange rate.

Express your final numerical $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ in rad/s and round your answer to four significant figures. Finally, assess whether the regime assumption is valid by comparing $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ to the angular frequency separation $|\\Delta \\omega|$, where $\\Delta \\omega$ is the difference in angular frequencies between the two environments, and discuss the implications for relaxation dispersion measurements in the microsecond to millisecond regime.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the observed resonance frequency, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, in the fast-exchange limit for a two-site exchange process, followed by a numerical calculation and an assessment of the physical regime.\n\nThe dynamics of the transverse magnetizations $M_A$ and $M_B$ for the two sites, A and B, in the rotating frame and in the absence of intrinsic relaxation are described by the Bloch-McConnell equations:\n$$ \\frac{dM_A}{dt} = i\\omega_A M_A - k_{AB} M_A + k_{BA} M_B $$\n$$ \\frac{dM_B}{dt} = i\\omega_B M_B + k_{AB} M_A - k_{BA} M_B $$\nwhere $\\omega_A$ and $\\omega_B$ are the resonance angular frequencies of the two sites, and $k_{AB}$ and $k_{BA}$ are the forward ($A \\to B$) and backward ($B \\to A$) rate constants for the exchange process. The total exchange rate is $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_{AB} + k_{BA}$.\n\nAt equilibrium, the principle of detailed balance requires that the flux between the two states is zero: $k_{AB}p_A = k_{BA}p_B$, where $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the equilibrium populations. Using this and the definition of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, we can express the individual rate constants in terms of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and the populations:\n$$ k_{AB} = p_B k_{\\mathrm{ex}} $$\n$$ k_{BA} = p_A k_{\\mathrm{ex}} $$\n\nThe system of differential equations can be written in matrix form:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} M_A \\\\ M_B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} i\\omega_A - k_{AB} & k_{BA} \\\\ k_{AB} & i\\omega_B - k_{BA} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} M_A \\\\ M_B \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{L} \\begin{pmatrix} M_A \\\\ M_B \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe time evolution of the system is governed by the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the matrix $\\mathbf{L}$. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{L} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$ (i\\omega_A - k_{AB} - \\lambda)(i\\omega_B - k_{BA} - \\lambda) - k_{AB}k_{BA} = 0 $$\nExpanding and substituting $k_{AB} = p_Bk_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and $k_{BA} = p_Ak_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ leads to a quadratic equation in $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda^2 - (i(\\omega_A + \\omega_B) - k_{\\mathrm{ex}})\\lambda + (i\\omega_A - p_B k_{\\mathrm{ex}})(i\\omega_B - p_A k_{\\mathrm{ex}}) - p_A p_B k_{\\mathrm{ex}}^2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + (k_{\\mathrm{ex}} - i(\\omega_A + \\omega_B))\\lambda - (\\omega_A \\omega_B + i k_{\\mathrm{ex}} (p_A \\omega_A + p_B \\omega_B)) = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this quadratic equation are the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{\\pm}$. In the fast-exchange limit, defined by the condition $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\gg |\\Delta\\omega| = |\\omega_A - \\omega_B|$, the system exhibits a single coalesced resonance. The properties of this resonance are given by one of the eigenvalues, the one corresponding to a slow decay rate. This is the \"slow\" eigenvalue, $\\lambda_+$.\n\nTo derive the leading-order expression for the observed frequency, we perform an asymptotic expansion of the solution for $\\lambda_+$ in the small parameter $|\\Delta\\omega|/k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. The imaginary part of the slow eigenvalue, $\\mathrm{Im}(\\lambda_+)$, corresponds to the observed frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, while the real part, $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_+)$, corresponds to the observed transverse relaxation rate, $-R_{2, \\mathrm{obs}}$.\n\nA formal expansion of the full solution for $\\lambda_+$ reveals that the terms can be ordered by powers of $\\Delta\\omega/k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. The lowest-order (or leading-order) term in the expansion for the imaginary part is:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\mathrm{Im}(\\lambda_+) = p_A\\omega_A + p_B\\omega_B + O\\left(\\frac{(\\Delta\\omega)^3}{k_{\\mathrm{ex}}^2}\\right) $$\nThis expression has a clear physical interpretation: in the fast-exchange limit, the nucleus samples both environments so rapidly that the observed precession frequency is simply the weighted average of the individual frequencies, with the weights being the equilibrium populations of the states. Therefore, the leading-order expression for the observed resonance angular frequency is:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} = p_A\\omega_A + p_B\\omega_B $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ using the provided parameters:\n$p_A = 0.7$\n$p_B = 0.3$\n$\\omega_A = 2\\pi \\times 500 \\text{ rad/s} = 1000\\pi \\text{ rad/s}$\n$\\omega_B = 2\\pi \\times 1500 \\text{ rad/s} = 3000\\pi \\text{ rad/s}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 10^{4} \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (0.7)(2\\pi \\times 500 \\text{ rad/s}) + (0.3)(2\\pi \\times 1500 \\text{ rad/s}) $$\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 2\\pi \\left( (0.7 \\times 500) + (0.3 \\times 1500) \\right) \\text{ rad/s} $$\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 2\\pi (350 + 450) \\text{ rad/s} $$\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 2\\pi (800) \\text{ rad/s} = 1600\\pi \\text{ rad/s} $$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx 5026.5482... \\text{ rad/s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx 5027 \\text{ rad/s} $$\n\nNext, we assess the validity of the fast-exchange assumption. The condition is $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\gg |\\Delta\\omega|$.\nLet's compute $|\\Delta\\omega|$:\n$$ \\Delta\\omega = \\omega_A - \\omega_B = (2\\pi \\times 500) - (2\\pi \\times 1500) = -1000 \\times 2\\pi = -2000\\pi \\text{ rad/s} $$\n$$ |\\Delta\\omega| = 2000\\pi \\text{ rad/s} \\approx 6283 \\text{ rad/s} $$\nWe compare this with the given exchange rate:\n$k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 10^4 \\text{ s}^{-1} = 10000 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\nThe ratio is $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}/|\\Delta\\omega| \\approx 10000 / 6283 \\approx 1.59$.\nSince $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is not much larger than $|\\Delta\\omega|$ (they are of the same order of magnitude), the condition for fast exchange is not strictly satisfied. The system is in the intermediate exchange regime.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications for relaxation dispersion measurements. Relaxation dispersion NMR experiments, such as Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) or $R_{1\\rho}$ rotating-frame relaxation, are specifically designed to characterize molecular dynamics on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale, which corresponds to the intermediate ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx |\\Delta\\omega|$) to fast-intermediate ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} > |\\Delta\\omega|$) exchange regimes. The fact that the given parameters place the system in the intermediate regime means that relaxation dispersion experiments would be highly effective. In this regime, the effective transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2, \\mathrm{eff}}$, shows a characteristic dependence on the applied radio-frequency field strength or pulsing rate. By measuring this dependence (the \"dispersion profile\") and fitting it to the appropriate theoretical model (derived from the Bloch-McConnell equations), one can precisely determine the kinetic ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) and thermodynamic ($p_A, p_B$) parameters of the exchange process, as well as the chemical shift difference ($\\Delta\\omega$). Therefore, the invalidity of the simple fast-exchange approximation for the peak position is precisely the reason why relaxation dispersion provides a powerful tool for studying the µs-ms dynamics of this system. The calculated $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ represents only a first-order approximation, and significant exchange-induced line broadening ($R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$) would also be present.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5027}$$", "id": "3721029"}, {"introduction": "Analyzing the dependence of relaxation dispersion profiles on the static magnetic field ($B_0$) is a powerful method for validating a motional model and accurately determining its parameters.

Scaling of $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ with the Static Magnetic Field ($B_0$)**\n\nWe begin from fundamental principles as requested.\n\nThe Larmor precession frequency, $\\omega_0$, of a nuclear spin in a static magnetic field of strength $B_0$ is given by:\n$$ \\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0 $$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant for a given nucleus (in this case, a proton). The spectrometer's operating frequency, such as $400$ MHz or $800$ MHz, is $\\nu_0 = \\omega_0 / (2\\pi)$, and is therefore directly proportional to $B_0$.\n\nChemical shift, $\\delta$, is a dimensionless quantity expressed in parts per million (ppm) that quantifies the difference in resonance frequency of a nucleus compared to a reference. The actual frequency difference, $\\Delta\\Omega$, in angular frequency units (rad/s), between two states with a chemical shift offset of $\\Delta\\delta$ is dependent on the Larmor frequency:\n$$ \\Delta\\Omega = \\Delta\\delta \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\omega_0 $$\nSince $\\omega_0 \\propto B_0$, it follows directly that the frequency separation between the two exchanging sites is proportional to the static magnetic field strength:\n$$ \\Delta\\Omega \\propto B_0 $$\n\nNext, we consider the two-site Bloch–McConnell exchange framework. In a transverse relaxation dispersion experiment like Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG), the exchange process between two sites with different chemical shifts contributes to the transverse relaxation rate. This exchange contribution is denoted $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$. The magnitude of this contribution is fundamentally dependent on the populations of the two states, $p_A$ and $p_B$, the total rate of exchange, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_{AB} + k_{BA}$, and the square of the frequency separation, $(\\Delta\\Omega)^2$.\n\nA widely used expression for the amplitude of the relaxation dispersion, which quantifies the magnitude of $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$, is proportional to the term $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}$:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}} = p_A p_B (\\Delta\\Omega)^2 $$\nDifferent analytical approximations of the Bloch-McConnell equations for $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ in various exchange regimes (fast, intermediate, slow) all show this dependence on $(\\Delta\\Omega)^2$. For example, in the fast-exchange limit ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\gg \\Delta\\Omega$), the exchange contribution is given by:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx \\frac{p_A p_B (\\Delta\\Omega)^2}{k_{\\mathrm{ex}}} $$\nThe problem states that the exchange kinetics (populations $p_A$, $p_B$ and rate constants, which determine $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) are independent of the magnetic field. Therefore, $p_A$, $p_B$, and $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ are constants with respect to $B_0$.\n\nCombining these facts, the field dependence of $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ is determined solely by the $(\\Delta\\Omega)^2$ term:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto (\\Delta\\Omega)^2 $$\nSince we established that $\\Delta\\Omega \\propto B_0$, we can conclude that the exchange-induced transverse relaxation rate scales with the square of the static magnetic field strength:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto B_0^2 $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Scaling Factor**\n\nWe are asked to compute the multiplicative scaling factor of $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ when increasing the spectrometer frequency from $400$ MHz to $800$ MHz. Let $\\nu_{0,1} = 400$ MHz and $\\nu_{0,2} = 800$ MHz be the two Larmor frequencies. As established, the spectrometer frequency $\\nu_0$ is directly proportional to the static field strength $B_0$.\n\nUsing the derived scaling relationship, $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto B_0^2$, and the fact that $B_0 \\propto \\nu_0$, we have:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto \\nu_0^2 $$\nThe ratio of the exchange contributions at the two fields is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(800\\ \\mathrm{MHz})}{R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(400\\ \\mathrm{MHz})} = \\frac{k \\cdot (\\nu_{0,2})^2}{k \\cdot (\\nu_{0,1})^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu_{0,2}}{\\nu_{0,1}}\\right)^2 $$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\frac{R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(800\\ \\mathrm{MHz})}{R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(400\\ \\mathrm{MHz})} = \\left(\\frac{800\\ \\mathrm{MHz}}{400\\ \\mathrm{MHz}}\\right)^2 = (2)^2 = 4 $$\nThe chemical shift offset $\\Delta\\delta = 0.2$ ppm is consistent with a typical NMR experiment but is not required for calculating this ratio, as it is a field-independent constant that would cancel out. The expected multiplicative scaling factor is exactly $4$.\n\n**3. Confounding Effect of Chemical Shift Anisotropy (CSA)**\n\nChemical Shift Anisotropy (CSA) is the dependence of a nucleus's chemical shift on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external magnetic field $B_0$. For an isotropically tumbling molecule, this effect is averaged out, resulting in a single isotropic chemical shift. However, the motional fluctuations of the orientation-dependent chemical shift provide a powerful mechanism for nuclear spin relaxation.\n\nThe contribution of CSA to the transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}}$, is given by the expression:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}} = C \\cdot (\\gamma B_0)^2 (\\Delta\\sigma)^2 f(\\tau_c, \\omega_0) $$\nwhere $C$ is a numerical constant, $\\Delta\\sigma$ is the anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor, $\\tau_c$ is the rotational correlation time, and $f(\\tau_c, \\omega_0)$ is a spectral density function. The crucial point is the explicit dependence on the square of the magnetic field, $B_0^2$, because $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0$. For a small molecule where $\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\ll 1$, the spectral density function is nearly constant, and the relationship simplifies to:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}} \\propto B_0^2 $$\nThe total observed transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the sum of all contributing mechanisms. In the context of this problem, it includes at least an intrinsic component $R_{2,\\mathrm{int}}$ and the exchange component $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$. The intrinsic rate itself is a sum of terms, including the CSA contribution: $R_{2,\\mathrm{int}} = R_{2,\\mathrm{other}} + R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}}$.\nThe total apparent relaxation rate is $R_2(\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}) = R_{2,\\mathrm{int}} + R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}})$.\n\nThe confounding effect arises because both the exchange contribution ($R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$) and the CSA relaxation contribution ($R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}}$) have the same quadratic dependence on the static magnetic field strength ($B_0^2$). When analyzing experimental data from multiple magnetic fields, an increase in the observed relaxation rate with $B_0^2$ could be due to either $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ or $R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}}$, or a combination of both. If the presence of CSA relaxation is not acknowledged and explicitly included in the data fitting model, its contribution to the relaxation will be incorrectly attributed to the chemical exchange process. This would lead to erroneous estimates of the exchange parameters, particularly the chemical shift difference $\\Delta\\Omega$, and would corrupt the verification of the $B_0^2$ scaling law for the exchange process itself. Therefore, the presence of a second, physically distinct relaxation mechanism with the same field dependence confounds the unambiguous experimental determination of the scaling for $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ alone.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "3721019"}, {"introduction": "While analytical formulas provide valuable insight into limiting cases, a complete description of exchange dynamics across all regimes is captured by the eigenvalues of the Bloch-McConnell rate matrix.

The elements of the matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ are:\n    $$\n    L_{11} = R_{2,A} + k_{AB} + i\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    L_{12} = -k_{BA}\n    $$\n    $$\n    L_{21} = -k_{AB}\n    $$\n    $$\n    L_{22} = R_{2,B} + k_{BA} - i\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2}\n    $$\n4.  Numerically compute the two complex eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{L}$. This is a standard procedure in linear algebra, typically accomplished using a numerical library.\n5.  Extract the real parts of the two computed eigenvalues.\n6.  Determine the minimum of these two real values. This result is the effective relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$, in units of s$^{-1}$.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the provided test cases using the following Python code to find the corresponding $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the effective transverse relaxation rate R2,eff for a two-site\n    chemical exchange system in NMR based on the Bloch-McConnell model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (pA, pB, delta_omega_hz, k_ex, R2A, R2B)\n    # Note: delta_omega is given as 2*pi*frequency, so we use the frequency in Hz.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: general microsecond–millisecond dynamics\n        (0.4, 0.6, 800.0, 5e3, 12.0, 18.0),\n        # Case 2: no exchange boundary\n        (0.5, 0.5, 800.0, 0.0, 10.0, 20.0),\n        # Case 3: fast exchange limit\n        (0.4, 0.6, 800.0, 1e6, 12.0, 18.0),\n        # Case 4: zero frequency offset\n        (0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 5e3, 8.0, 14.0),\n        # Case 5: extreme populations\n        (0.95, 0.05, 1500.0, 5e3, 9.0, 25.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        p_A, p_B, delta_omega_hz, k_ex, R2_A, R2_B = case\n\n        # Convert frequency difference in Hz to angular frequency in rad/s\n        delta_omega = 2 * np.pi * delta_omega_hz\n\n        # Calculate site-specific exchange rates\n        k_AB = k_ex * p_B\n        k_BA = k_ex * p_A\n\n        # Construct the complex 2x2 rate matrix L\n        # L = [[L11, L12], [L21, L22]]\n        # L11 = R2,A + i*delta_omega/2 + k_AB\n        # L12 = -k_BA\n        # L21 = -k_AB\n        # L22 = R2,B - i*delta_omega/2 + k_BA\n        \n        # Define the imaginary unit\n        i = 1j\n\n        L_matrix = np.array([\n            [R2_A + i * delta_omega / 2 + k_AB, -k_BA],\n            [-k_AB, R2_B - i * delta_omega / 2 + k_BA]\n        ], dtype=np.complex128)\n\n        # Compute the eigenvalues of the matrix L\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(L_matrix)\n\n        # R2,eff is the minimum of the real parts of the eigenvalues\n        r2_eff = np.min(eigenvalues.real)\n        \n        results.append(r2_eff)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\n# To generate the answer string, one would run solve()\n# solve()\n```", "answer": "[455.0768407481109,10.0,15.602521102917714,9.8,11.836814917417502]", "id": "3721072"}]}
