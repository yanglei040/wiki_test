It describes a classic experimental design in mass spectrometry to distinguish between charge-directed and charge-remote fragmentation mechanisms. The use of a fixed-charge derivative (like a pyridinium tag) to induce CRF in long-chain acyclic molecules like fatty acids is a well-established technique. The provided principles (mobile proton model, definitions of charge-directed and charge-remote fragmentation) are fundamental concepts in the field.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear comparison between two well-defined molecular ions under controlled conditions. The experimental observations are provided, and the question asks for a logical inference based on those observations and a given set of principles. A unique and stable solution can be derived.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective and uses precise, unambiguous scientific language.\n*   **Flaw Checklist:** The problem does not violate any of the listed invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, well-posed, and non-trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine which ion's fragmentation behavior matches the definition of charge-remote fragmentation (CRF), as described in principle (iii), and to explain this behavior using principles (i) and (ii). CRF is characterized by cleavages along the hydrocarbon chain, remote from the charge site, leading to a ladder of ions with mass differences corresponding to the loss of methylene groups ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$), which have a nominal mass of 14 Da.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Ion I (Pyridinium-tagged stearate):**\n    *   **Charge State:** This ion possesses a quaternary nitrogen atom in the pyridinium ring. A quaternary nitrogen has four covalent bonds and carries a permanent, localized positive charge. This is a \"fixed-charge\" system.\n    *   **Charge Mobility:** According to principle (i), fragmentation depends on charge location and mobility. In Ion I, the charge is not a mobile proton but an integral part of the molecular structure. It is localized at the pyridinium head group and cannot migrate along the hydrocarbon chain. Proton mobility is suppressed because the charge carrier is not a proton.\n    *   **Fragmentation Pathways:** The problem states that the CID spectrum of Ion I shows a prominent ladder of ions spaced by $\\Delta(m/z) \\approx 14$. This observation is the definitive signature of cleavage occurring sequentially along the saturated alkyl chain, which is the definition of CRF from principle (iii). The problem also states that the product ions retain the pyridinium tag. This confirms that the charge remains at the head group while the uncharged \"tail\" of the molecule is fragmented. Because the charge is fixed at one end and cannot migrate to participate in cleavages along the chain, the internal energy supplied during CID is dissipated through a different mechanism—bond cleavage along the chain remote from the charge. This directly leads to charge-remote fragmentation. The fixed charge essentially serves to \"hold\" the charge in place, allowing the high-energy CRF pathway to become dominant for fragmenting the alkyl chain.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Ion II (Protonated Stearic Acid, $[\\mathrm{M+H}]^{+}$):**\n    *   **Charge State:** This ion is formed by the addition of a proton to the neutral stearic acid molecule. The most basic sites on stearic acid are the oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group ($\\mathrm{-COOH}$). The positive charge is carried by this added proton.\n    *   **Charge Mobility:** This is a classic \"mobile proton\" system, as described in principle (i). The proton, while preferentially located at the energetically favorable carboxyl group, is mobile.\n    *   **Fragmentation Pathways:** The CID spectrum of Ion II is dominated by neutral losses typical of carboxylic acids (e.g., loss of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$) and lacks the $\\Delta(m/z) = 14$ ladder. This indicates that fragmentation is occurring at or near the carboxyl group. These are charge-directed or charge-proximate cleavages, as described in principle (ii). The proton at the carboxyl head group directs the fragmentation pathways, leading to low-energy cleavages characteristic of that functional group. For CRF to occur, the proton would need to migrate from the highly polar, stable location at the carboxyl group to the non-polar, high-energy environment of the saturated alkyl chain. This process is energetically unfavorable under low-energy CID conditions. Therefore, the charge remains localized at the head group (by energetic preference, not by covalent fixing), and fragmentation is directed from that site, precluding significant CRF.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIon I, the fixed-charge derivative, exhibits charge-remote fragmentation. The permanent localization of the charge at the pyridinium head group prevents charge migration and charge-directed fragmentation along the chain, thereby promoting the CRF pathway. Ion II, the mobile-proton species, primarily undergoes charge-directed fragmentation localized at the carboxyl group, as this is the most energetically favorable site for both the proton and for fragmentation initiation.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Ion I (pyridinium-tagged stearate) exhibits charge-remote fragmentation; the fixed positive charge localizes at the pyridinium nitrogen, suppresses proton mobility, and promotes bond scission along the saturated chain remote from the charge, generating a 14 Da-spaced ladder with fragments that retain the tag.**\n    *   This statement accurately identifies Ion I as undergoing CRF. It correctly attributes this to the fixed positive charge, which localizes the charge and prevents its migration (or \"suppresses proton mobility\", which is true as there is no mobile proton). It correctly links this to the promotion of remote bond scission and the formation of the characteristic 14 Da-spaced ladder where the charge is retained. This aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Ion II (protonated stearic acid) exhibits charge-remote fragmentation; the mobile proton can migrate away from the carboxylate, enabling remote cleavages all along the chain and forming the 14 Da-spaced ladder, whereas the fixed-charge derivative is restricted to charge-directed cleavages near the head group.**\n    *   This statement is incorrect. It falsely claims Ion II exhibits CRF, contradicting the experimental data provided in the problem. It also incorrectly posits that proton migration to the alkyl chain is a favorable process that enables CRF, which is not the case under these conditions. Finally, it incorrectly describes the behavior of the fixed-charge derivative, which is observed to undergo CRF, not just charge-directed cleavage near the head group.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Both Ion I and Ion II exhibit charge-remote fragmentation under the stated conditions; the absence of a 14 dalton ladder in one spectrum is attributable solely to lower internal energy deposition and is unrelated to charge localization.**\n    *   This statement is incorrect. It contradicts the problem's explicit assumption that the ions have similar internal energy distributions and are analyzed under identical conditions. The difference in fragmentation is fundamentally due to the difference in charge localization and mobility, a factor this option incorrectly dismisses.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Neither Ion I nor Ion II exhibits charge-remote fragmentation; a 14 dalton-spaced ladder is characteristic of inductive, charge-directed $\\alpha$-cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl, which is expected to be suppressed rather than enhanced by a fixed charge.**\n    *   This statement is incorrect. It falsely claims neither ion exhibits CRF, contradicting the data for Ion I. It also misunderstands the origin of the 14 Da ladder, incorrectly attributing it to a single $\\alpha$-cleavage rather than sequential cleavages along the entire chain, which defines CRF.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3695673"}, {"introduction": "A key signature of charge-remote fragmentation in long-chain molecules is a characteristic \"ladder\" of peaks, each separated by the mass of a methylene unit, $\\mathrm{CH}_2$.

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of mass deviations to validate the hypothesis of sequential methylene unit losses in a Charge Remote Fragmentation (CRF) spectrum.\n\nFirst, we determine the theoretical monoisotopic mass of a methylene unit, denoted as $m_{\\mathrm{CH}_2}$. This is the sum of the monoisotopic mass of one carbon atom ($m_{\\mathrm{C}}$ for $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$) and two hydrogen atoms ($m_{\\mathrm{H}}$ for $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$).\n$$m_{\\mathrm{CH}_2} = m_{\\mathrm{C}} + 2 \\times m_{\\mathrm{H}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{CH}_2} = 12.000000\\ \\mathrm{Da} + 2 \\times 1.007825\\ \\mathrm{Da} = 12.000000\\ \\mathrm{Da} + 2.015650\\ \\mathrm{Da} = 14.015650\\ \\mathrm{Da}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the observed mass differences between adjacent peaks in the provided series. Since the ions are singly charged ($z=1$), the measured $m/z$ values are numerically equal to the ion masses. Let the measured masses be $m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5$.

We compute the absolute value of each deviation:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|\\delta_1| &\\approx 4.28093\\ \\mathrm{ppm} \\\\\n|\\delta_2| &\\approx 2.14047\\ \\mathrm{ppm} \\\\\n|\\delta_3| &\\approx 1.42698\\ \\mathrm{ppm} \\\\\n|\\delta_4| &\\approx 4.28093\\ \\mathrm{ppm}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe maximum of these absolute values is:\n$$\\max(|\\delta_1|, |\\delta_2|, |\\delta_3|, |\\delta_4|) \\approx 4.28093\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$$\n\nRounding this value to four significant figures, as required, yields $4.281\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the charge-remote fragmentation (CRF) spectrum of a C18:1 $\\Delta 9$ fatty acid. The fatty acid chain is numbered from the carboxyl carbon, $\\mathrm{C1}$, to the terminal methyl carbon, $\\mathrm{C18}$. The double bond is located between $\\mathrm{C9}$ and $\\mathrm{C10}$.\n\nFragmentation involves the cleavage of a C-C bond. Cleavage between carbon $i$ and carbon $i+1$ (with $i$ ranging from $1$ to $17$) produces a charged fragment containing the pyridinium tag and carbons $\\mathrm{C1}$ through $\\mathrm{C}i$. The mass-to-charge ratio of this product ion is denoted as $m/z_i$.\n\nThe mass of the product ion, $m/z_i$, is the mass of the precursor ion, $M$, minus the mass of the neutral fragment that is lost, $m_{\\mathrm{NL}}$. The neutral loss consists of the hydrocarbon chain from carbon $i+1$ to carbon $N=18$. This neutral fragment contains $N-i = 18-i$ carbon atoms. The problem states to model the mass of this neutral loss as a simple multiple of the methylene unit mass, $m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}$.\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{NL},i} \\approx (N-i) \\times m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}\n$$\nTherefore, the $m/z$ of the product ion resulting from cleavage at position $i$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nm/z_i = M - m_{\\mathrm{NL},i} = M - (N-i)m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}\n$$\nFor this specific fatty acid with $N=18$:\n$$\nm/z_i = M - (18-i)m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that cleavage of the allylic bonds is significantly enhanced. The double bond is $\\mathrm{C9=C10}$. The adjacent single bonds (allylic bonds) are $\\mathrm{C8-C9}$ and $\\mathrm{C10-C11}$. Cleavage of the $\\mathrm{C8-C9}$ bond corresponds to product ion $m/z_8$ (index $i=8$). Cleavage of the $\\mathrm{C10-C11}$ bond corresponds to product ion $m/z_{10}$ (index $i=10$). Thus, the product ions for $i=8$ and $i=10$ are the enhanced, exceptional fragments.\n\nThe problem asks to identify a set of six cleavages around the double bond. The most logical interpretation is the three consecutive cleavages on each side of the double bond's central gap:\n-   On the carboxyl side: Cleavages at $i=6, 7, 8$.\n-   On the methyl side: Cleavages at $i=10, 11, 12$.\n\nThe full set of six cleavage indices to consider is therefore $I = \\{6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12\\}$.\nThe enhanced rungs within this set are those corresponding to $i=8$ and $i=10$.\nThe problem asks for the mean of the four product ions that are part of the *regular* CRF ladder, excluding the enhanced allylic fragments. These correspond to the cleavage indices $i \\in \\{6, 7, 11, 12\\}$.\n\nWe now compute the $m/z$ values for these four regular product ions using the derived formula, the given precursor mass $M=432.3$, and the methylene mass $m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}=14.01565$ Da.\n\n-   For $i=6$: $m/z_6 = M - (18-6)m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = M - 12m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}$\n-   For $i=7$: $m/z_7 = M - (18-7)m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = M - 11m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}$\n-   For $i=11$: $m/z_{11} = M - (18-11)m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = M - 7m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}$\n-   For $i=12$: $m/z_{12} = M - (18-12)m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = M - 6m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}$\n\nThe arithmetic mean, $\\bar{m/z}$, of these four values is:\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} = \\frac{1}{4} (m/z_6 + m/z_7 + m/z_{11} + m/z_{12})\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( (M - 12m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}) + (M - 11m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}) + (M - 7m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}) + (M - 6m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 4M - (12+11+7+6)m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} = \\frac{1}{4} ( 4M - 36m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} )\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} = M - 9m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $M$ and $m_{\\mathrm{CH_2}}$:\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} = 432.3 - 9 \\times 14.01565\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} = 432.3 - 126.14085\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} = 306.15915\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\bar{m/z} \\approx 306.2\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{306.2}\n$$", "id": "3695690"}]}
