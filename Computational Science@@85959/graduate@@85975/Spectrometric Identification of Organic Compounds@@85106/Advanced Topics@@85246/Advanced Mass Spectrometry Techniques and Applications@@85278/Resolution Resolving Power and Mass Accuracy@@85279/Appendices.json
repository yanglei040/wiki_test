The problem asks for the application of fundamental definitions to a practical scenario, which is a standard task in analytical chemistry and physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n### Part (a): Isotopic Resolution Criterion\nThe criterion for resolving two adjacent peaks is that their separation in the measurement domain ($m/z$) must be greater than the instrumental peak width at full width at half maximum (FWHM). Let the separation between adjacent isotopic peaks be $\\Delta(m/z)_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ and the FWHM of a single peak be $\\Delta m$. The condition for baseline resolution is generally $\\Delta(m/z)_{\\mathrm{iso}}  \\Delta m$.\n\nFirst, we determine the separation between adjacent isotopic peaks in the $m/z$ domain. An ion with neutral mass $M$ and charge state $z$ has a mass-to-charge ratio of $m/z = (M + z\\,m_{\\mathrm{H}})/z$. The next isotopologue, containing one additional neutron, has a neutral mass of $M + \\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}}$. Its mass-to-charge ratio is $(m/z)' = (M + \\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}} + z\\,m_{\\mathrm{H}})/z$.\n\nThe separation is the difference between these two values:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)_{\\mathrm{iso}} = (m/z)' - (m/z) = \\frac{M + \\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}} + z\\,m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{z} - \\frac{M + z\\,m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{z} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}}}{z}\n$$\nThe separation between adjacent isotopic peaks in the $m/z$ domain is therefore $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}}/z$.\n\nNext, we determine the instrumental peak width, $\\Delta m$. The resolving power is given as $R = m/\\Delta m$, where $m$ represents the $m/z$ value. Thus, the FWHM is:\n$$\n\\Delta m = \\frac{m/z}{R}\n$$\nThe criterion for resolving the isotopic peaks is $\\Delta(m/z)_{\\mathrm{iso}}  \\Delta m$, which translates to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}}}{z}  \\frac{m/z}{R}\n$$\nThis is the general criterion for isotopic resolution.\n\nNow, we assess this for the given conditions:\n- True charge state: $z_{\\mathrm{true}} = 5$.\n- Observed $m/z$: $m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 1201.0000$.\n- Isotopic mass difference: $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}} = 1.003355$ u.\n- Resolving power: $R = 5000$.\n\nThe isotopic peak separation is:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}}}{z_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{1.003355}{5} \\approx 0.200671 \\text{ Th}\n$$\nThe instrumental FWHM at the observed $m/z$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta m = \\frac{m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{R} = \\frac{1201.0000}{5000} = 0.2402 \\text{ Th}\n$$\nComparing the two values, we find that $\\Delta(m/z)_{\\mathrm{iso}} \\approx 0.200671$ Th is less than $\\Delta m = 0.2402$ Th.\nSince $\\Delta(m/z)_{\\mathrm{iso}}  \\Delta m$, the isotopic peaks are not resolved at a charge state of $z=5$.\n\n### Part (b): Erroneous Charge State Assignment\nWhen isotopic peaks are unresolved ($\\Delta(m/z)_{\\mathrm{iso}}  \\Delta m$), they merge into a single broad peak. The underlying isotopic fine structure may appear as subtle shoulders or bumps on the envelope of this broad peak. An analyst might mistakenly measure the distance between these subtle features and assume this distance represents the true isotopic separation. However, signal processing theory shows that for two closely spaced, overlapping Gaussian peaks, the apparent separation of the maxima of the convoluted signal is larger than the true separation of the underlying peaks, and it often approaches the instrumental line width, $\\Delta m$.\n\nThe problem states that an analyst makes such an error, taking the observed inter-peak separation to be $\\Delta m$. The analyst then equates this observed separation to the theoretical isotopic spacing, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}}/z$, to infer a charge state, which we will call $z_{\\mathrm{wrong}}$. The erroneous assumption is:\n$$\n\\Delta m = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}}}{z_{\\mathrm{wrong}}}\n$$\nWe can solve for $z_{\\mathrm{wrong}}$:\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{wrong}} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{n}}}{\\Delta m}\n$$\nUsing the values from part (a):\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{wrong}} = \\frac{1.003355}{0.2402} \\approx 4.177165...\n$$\nThe problem asks for the nearest-integer erroneous charge state. Rounding this value to the nearest integer gives:\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{wrong}} = 4\n$$\n\n### Part (c): Mass Accuracy Error\nWe are asked to derive an expression for the absolute fractional mass accuracy error, $\\varepsilon = |M_{\\mathrm{wrong}} - M_{\\mathrm{true}}|/M_{\\mathrm{true}}$. We start from the given relation $m/z = (M + z\\,m_{\\mathrm{H}})/z$.\nSolving for the neutral mass, $M$:\n$$\nz \\cdot (m/z) = M + z\\,m_{\\mathrm{H}}\n$$\n$$\nM = z \\cdot (m/z) - z\\,m_{\\mathrm{H}} = z(m/z - m_{\\mathrm{H}})\n$$\nUsing this equation, we can write expressions for the true neutral mass, $M_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and the erroneously calculated neutral mass, $M_{\\mathrm{wrong}}$. Both are calculated from the same observed peak apex, $m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}}$.\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{true}} = z_{\\mathrm{true}}(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}})\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{wrong}} = z_{\\mathrm{wrong}}(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}})\n$$\nNow, we substitute these into the definition of $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{|M_{\\mathrm{wrong}} - M_{\\mathrm{true}}|}{M_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{|z_{\\mathrm{wrong}}(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}}) - z_{\\mathrm{true}}(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}})|}{z_{\\mathrm{true}}(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}})}\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}})$ from the numerator:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{|(z_{\\mathrm{wrong}} - z_{\\mathrm{true}})(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}})|}{z_{\\mathrm{true}}(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}})}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for $\\varepsilon$ in terms of $z_{\\mathrm{true}}$, $z_{\\mathrm{wrong}}$, $m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, and $m_{\\mathrm{H}}$.\nGiven that $m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 1201.0000$ and $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007276$, the term $(m/z_{\\mathrm{obs}} - m_{\\mathrm{H}})$ is positive. Therefore, it can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{|z_{\\mathrm{wrong}} - z_{\\mathrm{true}}|}{z_{\\mathrm{true}}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $\\varepsilon$ using the charge states determined previously: $z_{\\mathrm{true}} = 5$ and $z_{\\mathrm{wrong}} = 4$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{|4 - 5|}{5} = \\frac{|-1|}{5} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a unitless decimal rounded to six significant figures.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = 0.200000\n$$\nThis represents a $20\\%$ error in the determined neutral mass, a significant consequence of misinterpreting unresolved isotopic peaks.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.200000}\n$$", "id": "3721345"}, {"introduction": "While high resolution is essential for separating ions, high mass accuracy is the key to determining their elemental composition.

Calculation of the Mass-to-Charge Ratios**\nThe problem specifies that for a singly charged adduct ion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{X}\\right]^{+}$, its mass is the sum of the neutral molecule's mass ($m_{\\mathrm{M}}$) and the cation's mass ($m_{\\mathrm{X}^{+}}$). The cation mass is defined as the neutral atomic mass minus the electron mass ($m_{\\mathrm{X}^{+}} = m_{\\mathrm{X}} - m_e$). Since the charge $z$ is $1$, the $m/z$ value is numerically equal to the ion's mass.\n\nFor the sodium adduct, $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}$:\n$(m/z)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}} = m_{\\mathrm{M}} + m(^{23}\\mathrm{Na}) - m_e$\n$(m/z)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}} = 378.21547207361 + 22.98976928 - 0.000548579909$\n$(m/z)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}} = 401.204692773701$\n\nFor the potassium adduct, $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{K}\\right]^{+}$:\n$(m/z)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{K}\\right]^{+}} = m_{\\mathrm{M}} + m(^{39}\\mathrm{K}) - m_e$\n$(m/z)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{K}\\right]^{+}} = 378.21547207361 + 38.96370668 - 0.000548579909$\n$(m/z)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{K}\\right]^{+}} = 417.178630173701$\n\n**3. Calculation of the ppm Difference**\nFirst, we find the difference in the $m/z$ values, which represents the numerator in the ppm formula:\n$\\Delta(m/z) = (m/z)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{K}\\right]^{+}} - (m/z)_{\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{Na}\\right]^{+}}$\n$\\Delta(m/z) = (m_{\\mathrm{M}} + m(^{39}\\mathrm{K}) - m_e) - (m_{\\mathrm{M}} + m(^{23}\\mathrm{Na}) - m_e)$\nThis simplifies to the difference between the neutral atomic masses of potassium and sodium:\n$\\Delta(m/z) = m(^{39}\\mathrm{K}) - m(^{23}\\mathrm{Na})$\n$\\Delta(m/z) = 38.96370668 - 22.98976928 = 15.9739374\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n\nNow, we substitute this difference and the $m/z$ of the sodium adduct into the ppm formula:\n$\\mathrm{ppm}_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{15.9739374}{401.204692773701} \\times 10^6$\n$\\mathrm{ppm}_{\\text{diff}} = 0.03981498006... \\times 10^6$\n$\\mathrm{ppm}_{\\text{diff}} = 39814.98006...$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to five significant figures. The first five significant figures of the result are $3, 9, 8, 1, 4$. The sixth digit is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fifth digit.\n$39814.98006... \\approx 39815$\n\nThe ppm difference is $39815$. This substantial difference underscores the importance of correctly identifying the adducting species in high-accuracy mass measurements.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{39815}\n$$", "id": "3721366"}]}
