It describes a common scenario in analytical chemistry, specifically in the field of mass spectrometric identification of organic compounds. The data provided are consistent with established physical constants. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe first task is to define the concept of exact-mass determination. In mass spectrometry, the **nominal mass** of an ion is its mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) rounded to the nearest integer value. It is calculated using the integer mass numbers of the most abundant isotopes of the constituent elements (e.g., $12$ for carbon, $1$ for hydrogen, $16$ for oxygen). In contrast, the **exact mass** of an ion is its mass calculated using the precise monoisotopic masses of the specific isotopes that constitute the ion. These masses are not integers due to nuclear binding energy and the fact that the atomic mass unit ($u$) is defined as $1/12$ the mass of a neutral atom of carbon-12 ($\\mathrm{^{12}C}$). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is capable of measuring these exact masses with high precision, which allows for the unambiguous determination of an ion's elemental formula, even among ions with the same nominal mass (isobars).\n\nThe second task is to compute the exact monoisotopic mass for each of the two given isobaric ions, $\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{7}O^{+}}$ and $\\mathrm{C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}^{+}}$, which both have a nominal mass of $m/z \\ 59$. We are given the necessary monoisotopic atomic masses: $m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) = 12.000000 \\ u$, $m(\\mathrm{^{1}H}) = 1.007825 \\ u$, and $m(\\mathrm{^{16}O}) = 15.994915 \\ u$. The mass of an electron ($m_e \\approx 5.486 \\times 10^{-4} \\ u$) is negligible compared to the required precision and is typically ignored in such calculations, as the tabulated atomic masses refer to neutral atoms. We calculate the mass of the neutral formula, which is an excellent approximation for the mass of the positive ion.\n\nFor the ether-derived oxonium ion, $\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{7}O^{+}}$:\nThe exact mass, $m_1$, is the sum of the masses of its constituent atoms.\n$$m_1 = 3 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) + 7 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{1}H}) + 1 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{16}O})$$\n$$m_1 = 3 \\times (12.000000) + 7 \\times (1.007825) + 1 \\times (15.994915)$$\n$$m_1 = 36.000000 + 7.054775 + 15.994915$$\n$$m_1 = 59.049690 \\ u$$\n\nFor the alternative acylium-type ion, $\\mathrm{C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}^{+}}$:\nThe exact mass, $m_2$, is calculated similarly.\n$$m_2 = 2 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) + 3 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{1}H}) + 2 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{16}O})$$\n$$m_2 = 2 \\times (12.000000) + 3 \\times (1.007825) + 2 \\times (15.994915)$$\n$$m_2 = 24.000000 + 3.023475 + 31.989830$$\n$$m_2 = 59.013305 \\ u$$\n\nThe third task is to determine the minimum resolving power required to distinguish these two ions. The resolving power, $R$, of a mass spectrometer is a measure of its ability to differentiate between two ions with a small mass difference. It is defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m}$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the ion being observed and $\\Delta m$ is the mass difference between two adjacent peaks that are just resolved. In this context, $\\Delta m$ is the difference between the exact masses of our two isobaric ions, and $m$ is their average mass, though using the nominal mass is a common and acceptable approximation since the mass difference is very small.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mass difference, $\\Delta m$:\n$$\\Delta m = |m_1 - m_2| = |59.049690 - 59.013305|$$\n$$\\Delta m = 0.036385 \\ u$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum resolving power required.

The corresponding neutral loss is $\\mathrm{CH_3O^\\bullet}$, with mass $m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 3 \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 12.000000 + 3 \\times 1.007825 + 15.994915 = 31.018390$ Da.\nThe precursor mass is also the sum of this product and neutral loss: $77.039125 + 31.018390 = 108.057515$.\n\nHigh-resolution mass spectrometry confirms that the product at $m/z \\approx 93$ has the composition $\\mathrm{C_6H_5O^+}$ and the product at $m/z \\approx 77$ has the composition $\\mathrm{C_6H_5^+}$. The task now is to evaluate which experimental design definitively proves these pathways.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Isolate $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet}$ of unlabelled anisole and measure accurate masses of the two product ions. Then repeat CID with $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-labelled anisole (oxygen-$18$ at the ether), $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$-labelled anisole (label at the methoxy carbon), and $\\mathrm{CD_3}$-anisole (deuterated methyl). For each label, record (i) exact $m/z$ of the product ion near $m/z \\approx 93$, (ii) exact $m/z$ of the product ion near $m/z \\approx 77$, (iii) corresponding neutral-loss masses from $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet}$, and (iv) the presence and isotopic behavior of any product ion near $m/z \\approx 94$.**\n\nThis option proposes a comprehensive strategy using all available tools: accurate mass, all three isotopic labels, analysis of both product ions and neutral losses, and a search for potential rearrangement products. Let's verify its predictions.\n- **Unlabelled masses**: The predicted exact masses for $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet}$ ($m/z=108.057515$), $[\\mathrm{C_6H_5O}]^+$ ($m/z=93.034040$), and $[\\mathrm{C_6H_5}]^+$ ($m/z=77.039125$) are all computed correctly, as shown above.\n- **$^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-label**: The mass shift for $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ vs $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ is $17.999160 - 15.994915 = 2.004245$ Da.\n  - $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet}$ at $m/z = 108.057515 + 2.004245 = 110.061760$. Correct.\n  - Product $m/z \\approx 93$ ($[\\mathrm{C_6H_5O}]^+$) retains the oxygen, so it shifts to $m/z = 93.034040 + 2.004245 = 95.038285$. Correct.\n  - Product $m/z \\approx 77$ ($[\\mathrm{C_6H_5}]^+$) loses the oxygen, so it does not shift. Correct.\n  - Neutral loss to $m/z \\approx 77$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3O^\\bullet}$. With the label, it becomes $\\mathrm{CH_3^{18}O^\\bullet}$. The mass of the loss increases from $31.018390$ to $31.018390 + 2.004245 = 33.022635$. Correct.\n- **$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$-label (methoxy)**: The mass shift for $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ vs $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ is $13.003355 - 12.000000 = 1.003355$ Da.\n  - $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet}$ shifts to $m/z = 108.057515 + 1.003355 = 109.060870$. Correct.\n  - Product $m/z \\approx 93$ ($[\\mathrm{C_6H_5O}]^+$) is formed by losing the methoxy carbon, so it remains unchanged. Correct.\n  - Neutral loss to $m/z \\approx 77$ is $\\mathrm{CH_3O^\\bullet}$. With the label, it becomes $\\mathrm{^{13}CH_3O^\\bullet}$. The mass of the loss increases from $31.018390$ to $32.021745$. Correct.\n- **$\\mathrm{CD_3}$-label**: The mass shift for one $\\mathrm{D}$ vs $\\mathrm{H}$ is $2.014102 - 1.007825 = 1.006277$ Da. For $\\mathrm{CD_3}$ vs $\\mathrm{CH_3}$, the shift is $3 \\times 1.006277 = 3.018831$ Da.\n  - $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet}$ shifts to $m/z = 108.057515 + 3.018831 = 111.076346$. Correct.\n  - Product $m/z \\approx 93$ ($[\\mathrm{C_6H_5O}]^+$) is formed by losing the methyl group ($\\mathrm{CD_3^\\bullet}$), so it remains unchanged. Correct. The neutral loss mass becomes $m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 3 \\times m(^{2}\\mathrm{H}) = 12.000000 + 3 \\times 2.014102 = 18.042306$ Da, correctly stated as different from the unlabelled loss of $\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$ ($15.023475$ Da). Correct.\n  - The check for rearrangement products such as $[\\mathrm{C_6H_6O}]^{+\\bullet}$ ($m/z=94.041865$) and its shift in the $\\mathrm{CD_3}$ analogue to probe H/D transfer is an example of rigorous mechanistic investigation. The calculation of the shifted mass is also correct: $m(\\mathrm{C_6H_5DO}) = m(\\mathrm{C_6H_6O}) - m(\\mathrm{H}) + m(\\mathrm{D}) = 94.041865 - 1.007825 + 2.014102 = 95.048142$. Correct.\nThis strategy is exhaustive, internally consistent, and all calculations are correct. It provides multiple, independent lines of evidence for each pathway.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Perform positive-mode electrospray ionization to generate $[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}]^{+}$ at $m/z \\approx 109$ and carry out unit-mass CID in a quadrupole, combined with gas-phase hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Interpret the product near $m/z \\approx 93$ by tracking its shift under $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ at the methoxy carbon, expecting it to increase by $+1.003355$ if the methoxy carbon is present, and assign the $m/z \\approx 77$ product by assuming a neutral radical loss of $\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$ from $[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}]^{+}$.**\n\nThis option contains multiple fundamental errors.\n1.  **Incorrect Ionization Method**: The problem specifies the precursor is the molecular radical cation $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet}$ formed by electron ionization, which is an odd-electron species. This option proposes using electrospray ionization (ESI) to form the protonated molecule $[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}]^+$, which is an even-electron species. The fragmentation rules for odd- and even-electron ions are different. Even-electron ions such as $[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}]^+$ strongly prefer to fragment by losing neutral, even-electron molecules.\n2.  **Violation of Even-Electron Rule**: The option suggests assigning the $m/z \\approx 77$ product by assuming a loss of a methyl radical ($\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$) from $[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}]^+$. This is a radical loss from an even-electron ion, which is a highly disfavored pathway. The expected fragmentation of $[\\mathrm{C_6H_5OCH_3}+\\mathrm{H}]^+$ would be loss of neutral methanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, mass $32$) to give $[\\mathrm{C_6H_5}]^+$ at $m/z = 109 - 32 = 77$. While the product is correct, the proposed neutral loss is mechanistically unsound. Moreover, losing $\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$ (mass $15$) from $m/z=109$ would give a product at $m/z=94$, not $77$.\n3.  **Loss of Information**: It proposes using a unit-mass quadrupole analyzer, discarding the high-resolution capability that allows for unambiguous determination of elemental composition.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use only $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$-methoxy-labelled anisole and high-resolution MS to compare unlabelled and labelled CID spectra. Identify the $m/z \\approx 77$ product ion as containing the methoxy carbon if it shifts by $+1.003355$, and assign the $m/z \\approx 93$ product ion as tropylium $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ if it does not shift, since tropylium does not contain the methoxy carbon.**\n\nThis option contains severe analytical and factual errors.\n1.  **Incorrect Hypothesis for $m/z=77$**: It suggests testing if the $m/z=77$ ion ($[\\mathrm{C_6H_5}]^+$) contains the methoxy carbon. As established, this ion is formed by *losing* the entire methoxy group, $\\mathrm{CH_3O^\\bullet}$. It therefore cannot contain the methoxy carbon and will not shift upon $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$-labeling of that carbon. The premise of the test is incorrect.\n2.  **Incorrect Identification of $m/z=93$**: It proposes that the $m/z=93$ ion could be tropylium, $[\\mathrm{C_7H_7}]^+$. This is factually wrong. The exact mass of $[\\mathrm{C_7H_7}]^+$ is $7 \\times 12.000000 + 7 \\times 1.007825 = 91.054775$ Da. The observed ion is at $m/z \\approx 93$ with exact mass $93.034040$, which corresponds to $\\mathrm{C_6H_5O^+}$. High-resolution MS (which the option claims to use) would immediately disprove the tropylium assignment.\n3.  **Insufficient Evidence**: Using only one isotopic label provides an incomplete picture and is not sufficient for a definitive assignment, especially when compared to the comprehensive approach in A.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Synthesize $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-anisole and perform accurate-mass CID on $[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet}$ only. If the product near $m/z \\approx 93$ does not shift upon $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-labelling, conclude that the ether oxygen is lost and the $m/z \\approx 77$ ion must be $\\mathrm{C_6H_5^+}$ formed by loss of $\\mathrm{CH_3O^\\bullet}$; do not consider neutral-loss masses or complementary cations.**\n\nThis option describes an incomplete and methodologically flawed experiment.\n1.  **Insufficient Evidence**: It relies on a single isotopic label. While informative, it is not as definitive as a multi-label approach.\n2.  **Logical Fallacy**: It presents a non-sequitur: \"If the product near $m/z \\approx 93$ ... [behaves a certain way], conclude that... the $m/z \\approx 77$ ion must be $\\mathrm{C_6H_5^+}$\". The fragmentation pathways to $m/z=93$ and $m/z=77$ are competitive. The fragmentation behavior of one does not logically \"force\" the identity of the other. The identity of the $m/z=77$ ion must be established by studying that ion and its formation directly.\n3.  **Poor Scientific Practice**: It explicitly states to \"do not consider neutral-loss masses\". Analyzing the neutral loss is a critical and complementary piece of evidence in tandem mass spectrometry. The identity of the neutral loss ($[\\mathrm{M}]^{+\\bullet} - [\\text{Product Ion}]^+$) in an accurate-mass experiment provides a second constraint on the elemental composition of the fragmentation process. Ignoring this information is poor science and weakens the conclusion.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A describes the only strategy that is comprehensive, scientifically rigorous, and sufficient for the definitive assignment of the fragmentation pathways. It correctly uses high-resolution mass spectrometry, a full suite of isotopic labels, and analyzes both product ions and their corresponding neutral losses. All of its predictions are based on correct calculations and sound mechanistic principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3704819"}]}
