It is a standard, albeit simplified, problem in the physics of NMR that tests the understanding of factors influencing sensitivity. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe per-scan Signal-to-Noise Ratio, denoted as $S_{1}$, is the ratio of the signal voltage, $V_{\\text{signal}}$, to the root-mean-square (RMS) noise voltage, $V_{\\text{noise}}$, for a single acquisition.\n$$S_{1} = \\frac{V_{\\text{signal}}}{V_{\\text{noise}}}$$\n\nWe must determine how $V_{\\text{signal}}$ and $V_{\\text{noise}}$ scale with the gyromagnetic ratio, $\\gamma$, based on the provided principles.\n\n**1. Signal Voltage Scaling**\nAccording to the second principle, the induced signal voltage is proportional to the product of the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_{0}$, and the magnitude of the transverse magnetization, $M_{\\perp}$.\n$$V_{\\text{signal}} \\propto \\omega_{0} M_{\\perp}$$\nThe Larmor frequency is given by $\\omega_{0} = \\gamma B_{0}$. Since the static magnetic field $B_{0}$ is held constant for the comparison, $\\omega_{0} \\propto \\gamma$.\n\nThe transverse magnetization $M_{\\perp}$ is generated by applying a radiofrequency pulse that rotates the equilibrium longitudinal magnetization $M_{0}$ into the transverse plane. For a non-saturating pulse of a given flip angle, $M_{\\perp}$ is directly proportional to $M_{0}$.\n$$M_{\\perp} \\propto M_{0}$$\nThe first principle states that the equilibrium magnetization $M_{0}$ is proportional to $N \\gamma^{2} B_{0}$. The problem specifies a comparison where only $\\gamma$ differs, implying the number of observed spins, $N$, and the field, $B_{0}$, are constant. Therefore, the dependence of $M_{0}$ on $\\gamma$ is:\n$$M_{0} \\propto \\gamma^{2}$$\nCombining these proportionalities, we find the scaling of the signal voltage:\n$$V_{\\text{signal}} \\propto \\omega_{0} M_{0} \\propto (\\gamma)(\\gamma^{2}) = \\gamma^{3}$$\n\n**2. Noise Voltage Scaling**\nAccording to the third principle, the RMS noise voltage is proportional to the square root of the detection bandwidth, $\\Delta f$.\n$$V_{\\text{noise}} \\propto \\sqrt{\\Delta f}$$\nThe problem states that the detection bandwidth scales with the resonance frequency, $\\omega_{0}$, for a fixed probe quality factor.\n$$\\Delta f \\propto \\omega_{0}$$\nSince $\\omega_{0} \\propto \\gamma$, the bandwidth also scales with $\\gamma$:\n$$\\Delta f \\propto \\gamma$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for noise voltage gives its dependence on $\\gamma$:\n$$V_{\\text{noise}} \\propto \\sqrt{\\gamma} = \\gamma^{1/2}$$\n\n**3. Per-Scan SNR Scaling**\nThe per-scan SNR, $S_{1}$, scales as the ratio of the signal voltage scaling to the noise voltage scaling:\n$$S_{1} \\propto \\frac{V_{\\text{signal}}}{V_{\\text{noise}}} \\propto \\frac{\\gamma^{3}}{\\gamma^{1/2}} = \\gamma^{3 - 1/2} = \\gamma^{5/2}$$\nThus, the intrinsic sensitivity per scan is proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio to the power of $5/2$.\n\n**4. Number of Scans Required for SNR Matching**\nThe total SNR, $S_{\\text{total}}$, after averaging $N_{\\text{scans}}$ acquisitions is proportional to the per-scan SNR multiplied by the square root of the number of scans:\n$$S_{\\text{total}} = k S_{1} \\sqrt{N_{\\text{scans}}}$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nWe are asked to find the number of scans for $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, denoted $N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$, required to match the SNR of a single-scan $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ experiment, where $N_{\\text{scans}, ^{1}\\mathrm{H}} = 1$. We set the total SNRs equal:\n$$S_{\\text{total}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = S_{\\text{total}, ^{1}\\mathrm{H}}$$\n$$k S_{1, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}} \\sqrt{N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}}} = k S_{1, ^{1}\\mathrm{H}} \\sqrt{1}$$\nSolving for $N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$:\n$$\\sqrt{N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}}} = \\frac{S_{1, ^{1}\\mathrm{H}}}{S_{1, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = \\left( \\frac{S_{1, ^{1}\\mathrm{H}}}{S_{1, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}}} \\right)^{2}$$\nUsing the scaling relationship $S_{1} \\propto \\gamma^{5/2}$, the ratio of per-scan SNRs is:\n$$\\frac{S_{1, ^{1}\\mathrm{H}}}{S_{1, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}}} = \\frac{(\\gamma_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}})^{5/2}}{(\\gamma_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}})^{5/2}} = \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}}}{\\gamma_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}} \\right)^{5/2}$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}}}{\\gamma_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}} \\right)^{5/2} \\right]^{2} = \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}}}{\\gamma_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}} \\right)^{5}$$\nThis is the required multiplicative factor for the number of scans.\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\nWe now substitute the given values for the gyromagnetic ratios:\n$$\\gamma_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}} = 2.67522 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{rad s}^{-1} \\text{T}^{-1}$$\n$$\\gamma_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = 6.72828 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{rad s}^{-1} \\text{T}^{-1}$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma_{^{1}\\mathrm{H}}}{\\gamma_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}}} = \\frac{2.67522 \\times 10^{8}}{6.72828 \\times 10^{7}} \\approx 3.976098$$\nThe required factor is this ratio raised to the fifth power:\n$$N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}} = (3.976098)^{5} \\approx 993.791$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$N_{\\text{scans}, ^{13}\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 994$$\nTherefore, approximately $994$ scans are required for the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ experiment to achieve the same SNR as a single scan of the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ experiment under these idealized conditions.

By the principle of reciprocity, the coil's sensitivity to these fields is related to the magnetic field ($B_1$) it would produce per unit current if it were used for transmission.\n\n$1$. According to Faraday's law of induction, a time-varying magnetic field, $\\vec{B}(t)$, induces a rotational electric field, $\\vec{E}(t)$. This is expressed mathematically as $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}$. The RF coil generates an oscillating magnetic field at the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_0$. This field, even if virtual in the receive-only case, penetrates the sample.\n\n$2$. If the sample is electrically conductive, like the salty aqueous solution with mobile ions, the induced electric field, $\\vec{E}$, will drive electric currents within the sample, known as eddy currents. The density of these currents, $\\vec{J}$, is given by Ohm's law for a conductive medium: $\\vec{J} = \\sigma \\vec{E}$, where $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity of the sample. A higher conductivity (as in the salty solution) results in a larger current density for a given induced electric field.\n\n$3$. These eddy currents dissipate energy as heat within the sample through Joule heating. The power dissipated per unit volume is given by $P_{\\mathrm{diss}} = \\vec{J} \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\sigma |\\vec{E}|^2$. This energy dissipation represents a loss mechanism for the RF coil system.\n\n$4$. From the perspective of the coil's electrical circuit, this power loss is equivalent to an additional resistance in series with the coil's own intrinsic resistance. The total resistance of the loaded coil can be modeled as $R_{\\mathrm{total}} = R_{\\mathrm{coil}} + R_{\\mathrm{sample}}$, where $R_{\\mathrm{coil}}$ is the resistance of the coil conductor itself and $R_{\\mathrm{sample}}$ is the effective resistance contributed by the sample's conductive losses. A higher sample conductivity $\\sigma$ leads to a larger $R_{\\mathrm{sample}}$.\n\n$5$. The primary source of noise in this system (as stated in the problem) is Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise, which arises from the thermal agitation of charge carriers in resistive components. The spectral density of the noise voltage, $S_v$, is given by $S_v = 4 k_B T R$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $R$ is the resistance. For the coil system, the total root-mean-square (RMS) noise voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{noise}}$, across a given acquisition bandwidth, $\\Delta f$, is proportional to the square root of the total resistance: $V_{\\mathrm{noise}} = \\sqrt{4 k_B T R_{\\mathrm{total}} \\Delta f}$.\n\nTherefore, a higher sample conductivity (salty solution) increases $R_{\\mathrm{sample}}$, which increases $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$.

According to Faraday's law of induction, this voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of magnetic flux from the sample. The problem states that the static magnetic field ($B_0$), coil geometry, and filling factor are identical for both samples. Both experiments target the same nucleus ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$) and are performed at the same temperature ($T$). Under these identical conditions, the magnitude of the nuclear magnetization and its coupling to the coil are the same. Consequently, the induced signal voltage is identical for both the organic solvent and the saline solution.\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{signal, org}} = V_{\\mathrm{signal, salt}} = V_{\\mathrm{signal}}\n$$\n\n**Noise Voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{noise}}$):**\nAs established in Part $1$, the RMS noise voltage is given by $V_{\\mathrm{noise}} = \\sqrt{4 k_B T R_{\\mathrm{total}} \\Delta f}$.
