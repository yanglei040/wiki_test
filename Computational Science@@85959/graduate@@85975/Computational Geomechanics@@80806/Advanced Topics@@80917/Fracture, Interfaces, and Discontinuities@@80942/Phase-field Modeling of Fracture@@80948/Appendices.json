This does not invalidate the problem.\n\nNo flaws listed in the problem validation checklist are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe stationary profile $d(x)$ is the function that minimizes the energy functional $\\Psi[d]$. This is a classic problem in the calculus of variations. The minimizer must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation.\nThe integrand of the functional is the Lagrangian, $L(d, d')$, where $d' = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}d}{\\mathrm{d}x}$.\n$$\nL(x, d, d') = G_c \\left( \\frac{d^{2}}{2\\ell} + \\frac{\\ell}{2}(d')^{2} \\right)\n$$\nSince the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on $x$, this is a conservative system for which the Beltrami identity could be used. However, applying the standard Euler-Lagrange equation is also straightforward:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d'}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFirst, we compute the required partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d} = G_c \\left( \\frac{2d}{2\\ell} \\right) = \\frac{G_c d}{\\ell}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d'} = G_c \\left( \\frac{\\ell}{2}(2d') \\right) = G_c \\ell d'\n$$\nNext, we find the total derivative of the second term with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial d'}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}(G_c \\ell d') = G_c \\ell d''\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the Euler-Lagrange equation, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{G_c d}{\\ell} - G_c \\ell d'' = 0\n$$\nThe constant $G_c$ is positive, so we can divide by it. Rearranging the terms gives a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\ell^{2} d'' - d = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad d'' - \\frac{1}{\\ell^{2}} d = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation for this ODE is $r^2 - \\frac{1}{\\ell^2} = 0$, which has roots $r_1 = \\frac{1}{\\ell}$ and $r_2 = -\\frac{1}{\\ell}$.\nThe general solution is therefore of the form:\n$$\nd(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants to be determined from the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are $d(0)=1$ and $d(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. We must apply the condition at infinity carefully.\nFor the solution to decay to $0$ as $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/\\ell)$, which grows unbounded, must be eliminated. This requires $C_1 = 0$. So for $x  0$, the solution must be of the form $d(x) = C_2 \\exp(-x/\\ell)$.\nFor the solution to decay to $0$ as $x \\to -\\infty$, the term $\\exp(-x/\\ell)$ must be eliminated. This requires $C_2 = 0$. So for $x  0$, the solution must be of the form $d(x) = C_1 \\exp(x/\\ell)$.\n\nLet's apply the condition at the center, $d(0)=1$.\nFor the solution valid for $x  0$, we have $d(x) = C_2 \\exp(-x/\\ell)$. Approaching $x=0$ from the right, $d(0) = C_2 \\exp(0) = C_2$. So, $C_2=1$.\nFor the solution valid for $x  0$, we have $d(x) = C_1 \\exp(x/\\ell)$. Approaching $x=0$ from the left, $d(0) = C_1 \\exp(0) = C_1$. So, $C_1=1$.\n\nCombining these results, the solution is:\n$$\nd(x) = \\begin{cases} \\exp(-x/\\ell)  \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\\\ \\exp(x/\\ell)  \\text{if } x  0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis piecewise function can be written more compactly using the absolute value function:\n$$\nd(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\ell}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the stationary optimal profile for the phase-field variable $d(x)$.\n\nNext, we compute the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of this profile. The maximum value of $d(x)$ occurs at $x=0$, where $d(0) = \\exp(0) = 1$. The half maximum value is therefore $1/2$.\nWe need to find the values of $x$ for which $d(x) = 1/2$.\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\ell}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\frac{|x|}{\\ell} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)\n$$\n$$\n|x| = \\ell \\ln(2)\n$$\nThis equation gives two solutions for $x$: $x_1 = -\\ell \\ln(2)$ and $x_2 = \\ell \\ln(2)$.\nThe FWHM is defined as the distance between these two points:\n$$\n\\text{FWHM} = x_2 - x_1 = \\ell \\ln(2) - (-\\ell \\ln(2)) = 2\\ell \\ln(2)\n$$\nThis is the characteristic width of the diffuse crack in terms of the length scale parameter $\\ell$. The problem asks to \"Express the final width in meters\". Since $\\ell$ is an internal length scale, it has units of length. If $\\ell$ is provided in meters, the expression $2\\ell\\ln(2)$ directly gives the width in meters. The result is a symbolic expression, not a numerical value, as no value for $\\ell$ was given.\n\nThe final answers are the derived profile $d(x)$ and the expression for the FWHM.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\ell}\\right)  2\\ell\\ln(2) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3550312"}, {"introduction": "A powerful feature of phase-field models is their ability to predict material failure from first principles, linking microscopic parameters to macroscopic strength.

A damage process can initiate from the sound state $d=0$ only if the potential $F(d, \\sigma)$ is non-negative for infinitesimal $d0$. This requires the slope at $d=0$ to be non-negative, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d}(0, \\sigma) \\ge 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d}(0, \\sigma) = w'(0) - \\frac{c_{w} \\ell \\sigma^{2}}{E G_{c}} \\frac{1}{(1-0)^3} = 1 - \\frac{(4/3) \\ell \\sigma^{2}}{E G_{c}}\n$$\nSetting this to be $\\ge 0$ gives a condition on stress for nucleation:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{4\\ell \\sigma^{2}}{3E G_{c}} \\ge 0 \\implies \\sigma^2 \\le \\frac{3 E G_c}{4 \\ell}\n$$\nThis implies that for stresses $\\sigma  \\sigma_{\\text{nuc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 E G_c}{4 \\ell}}$, the sound state is unstable and damage will nucleate. At $\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\text{nuc}}$, a damage pathway opens. This is the damage nucleation threshold.\n\nNext, we check if the tensile strength coincides with this threshold. We search for a peak load by applying the general criterion $w(d_c) - \\frac{1}{2} w'(d_c) d_c(1-d_c)(2-d_c) = 0$.\n$$\nd_c - \\frac{1}{2}(1)d_c(1-d_c)(2-d_c) = 0\n$$\n$$\nd_c \\left[1 - \\frac{1}{2}(1-d_c)(2-d_c)\\right] = 0\n$$\nOne solution is the trivial one, $d_c=0$. The other comes from the bracketed term:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{1}{2}(1-d_c)(2-d_c) \\implies 2 = 2 - 3d_c + d_c^2 \\implies d_c^2 - 3d_c = 0\n$$\nThis gives $d_c(d_c-3)=0$, with solutions $d_c=0$ and $d_c=3$. Neither of these represents a valid critical damage state within the physical range $(0,1]$.\nThe absence of a solution for $d_c \\in (0,1]$ means that the stress-damage curve $\\sigma(d_{\\max})$ does not have a maximum (a peak load) after nucleation.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation and implementation.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the damage variable $d$ at a material point for a prescribed strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. This is achieved by minimizing a local energy functional. The process starts from an undamaged state ($d=0$) with a zero history field ($H=0$). The prescribed strain is applied in a single step, which defines the new value for the history field.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary elastic constants from the given Young's modulus $\\mathrm{E} = 3.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu = 0.25$.\nThe Lamé parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{E}\\,\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} = \\dfrac{(3.0 \\times 10^{10})(0.25)}{(1+0.25)(1-2 \\cdot 0.25)} = \\dfrac{7.5 \\times 10^{9}}{1.25 \\cdot 0.5} = 1.2 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{E}}{2(1+\\nu)} = \\dfrac{3.0 \\times 10^{10}}{2(1+0.25)} = \\dfrac{3.0 \\times 10^{10}}{2.5} = 1.2 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe bulk modulus $\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{K} = \\lambda + \\dfrac{2}{3}\\mu = 1.2 \\times 10^{10} + \\dfrac{2}{3}(1.2 \\times 10^{10}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n\nThe damage evolution is governed by the local minimization of the regularized energy density $\\psi(d)$, where $d \\in [0,1]$ is the damage variable:\n$$\n\\psi(d) = g(d)\\,H + \\dfrac{G_{\\mathrm{c}}}{2\\ell}\\,d^{2}\n$$\nHere, $g(d) = (1-d)^2 + \\kappa$ is the degradation function, $H$ is the history field representing the maximum damage driving energy experienced so far, $G_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$ is the critical energy release rate, and $\\ell = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ is the length scale parameter.
