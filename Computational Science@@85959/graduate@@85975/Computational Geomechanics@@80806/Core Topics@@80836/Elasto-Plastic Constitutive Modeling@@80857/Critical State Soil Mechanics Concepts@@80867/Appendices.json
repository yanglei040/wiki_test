We need to compare the specific volume $v$ of the current state at pressure $p'$ with the specific volume $v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p')$ that the soil would have if it were normally consolidated at the same pressure $p'$. The vertical offset is defined as $\\Delta v = v - v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p')$.\n\nThe equation for the NCL is defined by its slope $-\\lambda$ and a point $(p_r, N)$:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p') - N = -\\lambda (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p_r)) \\implies v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p') = N - \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{p'}{p_r}\\right)\n$$\nThe preconsolidation point $(p'_{c}, v_c)$ lies on the NCL, as this is the point of maximum past pressure from which unloading began. Therefore, the specific volume at preconsolidation, $v_c$, is:\n$$\nv_c = v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p'_{c}) = N - \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{p'_{c}}{p_r}\\right)\n$$\nThe current state $(p', v)$ lies on a URL that passes through $(p'_{c}, v_c)$ and has a slope of $-\\kappa$. The equation for this line is:\n$$\nv - v_c = -\\kappa (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p'_{c}))\n$$\nThis gives the current specific volume $v$ as:\n$$\nv = v_c - \\kappa (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p'_{c}))\n$$\nTo find the offset $\\Delta v$, we calculate $v - v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p')$. Let's establish a direct relationship between $v$ and $v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p')$. From the NCL equation, we can also write:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p') - v_c = -\\lambda (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p'_{c}))\n$$\nNow we have two expressions, one for $v$ and one for $v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p')$, both relative to the same point $(p'_{c}, v_c)$:\n1.  $v - v_c = -\\kappa (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p'_{c}))$\n2.  $v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p') - v_c = -\\lambda (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p'_{c}))$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives the desired offset $\\Delta v$:\n$$\n(v - v_c) - (v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p') - v_c) = [-\\kappa (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p'_{c}))] - [-\\lambda (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p'_{c}))]\n$$\n$$\nv - v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p') = (\\lambda - \\kappa) (\\ln(p') - \\ln(p'_{c}))\n$$\nThe vertical offset is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta v = (\\lambda - \\kappa) \\ln\\left(\\frac{p'}{p'_{c}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the definition of OCR, we have $p'/p'_{c} = 1/\\mathrm{OCR}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\Delta v$:\n$$\n\\Delta v = (\\lambda - \\kappa) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{OCR}}\\right) = -(\\lambda - \\kappa) \\ln(\\mathrm{OCR})\n$$\nThis expression quantifies the vertical offset in terms of the given parameters.\n\nTo determine whether the current state is above, on, or below the NCL, we evaluate the sign of $\\Delta v$:\n- The compression index $\\lambda = 0.22$ is greater than the swelling index $\\kappa = 0.06$, so the term $(\\lambda - \\kappa) = 0.22 - 0.06 = 0.16$ is positive.\n- The soil is overconsolidated, with $\\mathrm{OCR} = 4$, which is greater than $1$. The natural logarithm of any number greater than $1$ is positive, so $\\ln(\\mathrm{OCR}) = \\ln(4)$ is positive.\n- Therefore, $\\Delta v = -(\\text{positive}) \\times (\\text{positive})$, which is a negative value.\n\nSince $\\Delta v = v - v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p')$ is negative, it implies that $v  v_{\\mathrm{NCL}}(p')$. This means the specific volume of the overconsolidated soil is less than that of a normally consolidated soil at the same pressure. Consequently, the current state at $p'$ lies **below** the Normally Consolidated Line. This is physically correct, as an overconsolidated soil is denser (has a lower specific volume and void ratio) than a normally consolidated soil at the same effective stress.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of $p'_{c}$.\n$$\np'_{c} = 800 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives $800.0$ kPa.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{800.0}\n$$", "id": "3514762"}, {"introduction": "Critical state models describe soil behavior using a yield surface that separates elastic from plastic deformation.

First, we derive the relationship between the increment of the hardening variable, $d\\ln p'_{c}$, and the plastic volumetric strain increment, $d\\epsilon_{v}^{p}$. Second, we use this relationship and the given data to compute the updated preconsolidation pressure and the corresponding shift in the yield surface center.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Hardening Rule**\n\nThe fundamental assumption of plasticity is the decomposition of the total strain increment into an elastic part and a plastic part. For volumetric strains, this is written as:\n$$d\\epsilon_{v} = d\\epsilon_{v}^{e} + d\\epsilon_{v}^{p}$$\nwhere $d\\epsilon_{v}$ is the total volumetric strain aincrement, $d\\epsilon_{v}^{e}$ is the elastic volumetric strain increment, and $d\\epsilon_{v}^{p}$ is the plastic volumetric strain increment.\n\nThe problem states that $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa$ are the slopes of the volumetric strain versus $\\ln p'$ relationship.\nThe elastic behavior is governed by $\\kappa$. The incremental elastic volumetric strain is related to the incremental change in mean effective stress as:\n$$d\\epsilon_{v}^{e} = \\kappa \\, d(\\ln p') = \\kappa \\frac{dp'}{p'}$$\nThe total volumetric strain for a state on the virgin Normal Compression Line (NCL) is governed by $\\lambda$. For an isotropic compression test where the stress path follows the NCL, the total incremental volumetric strain is:\n$$d\\epsilon_{v} = \\lambda \\, d(\\ln p') = \\lambda \\frac{dp'}{p'}$$\nThe plastic volumetric strain increment is the difference between the total and elastic increments:\n$$d\\epsilon_{v}^{p} = d\\epsilon_{v} - d\\epsilon_{v}^{e} = (\\lambda - \\kappa) \\frac{dp'}{p'}$$\nThis relationship is general. Now we apply it to the hardening law. The hardening of the material, represented by the evolution of the preconsolidation pressure $p'_{c}$, is driven by plastic volumetric straining. For the MCC model, the state of a normally consolidated soil during virgin isotropic compression lies on the yield surface. The loading condition given is isotropic, meaning $q=0$. Substituting $q=0$ into the yield function $f = \\frac{q^{2}}{M^{2}} + p'(p' - p'_{c}) = 0$ gives:\n$$p'(p' - p'_{c}) = 0$$\nSince $p' > 0$ for a soil element, we must have $p' = p'_{c}$. This means that during isotropic loading, the mean effective stress is equal to the preconsolidation pressure. Therefore, any change $dp'$ corresponds to a change $dp'_{c}$, and consequently $d(\\ln p') = d(\\ln p'_{c})$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the plastic volumetric strain increment, we obtain the hardening rule for the MCC model:\n$$d\\epsilon_{v}^{p} = (\\lambda - \\kappa) d(\\ln p'_{c})$$\nRearranging this equation gives the desired relation for the incremental change in the hardening variable in terms of the plastic volumetric strain increment:\n$$d\\ln p'_{c} = \\frac{d\\epsilon_{v}^{p}}{\\lambda - \\kappa}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Updated State**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\lambda = 0.2$\n- $\\kappa = 0.05$\n- $p'_{c,\\text{old}} = 300$ kPa\n- $d\\epsilon_{v}^{p} = 0.01$\n\nFirst, we calculate the incremental change in the log of the preconsolidation pressure using the derived formula:\n$$d\\ln p'_{c} = \\frac{0.01}{0.2 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.01}{0.15} = \\frac{1}{15}$$\nNow, we compute the updated preconsolidation pressure, $p'_{c,\\text{new}}$, using the provided update rule:\n$$p'_{c,\\text{new}} = p'_{c,\\text{old}} \\exp(d\\ln p'_{c}) = 300 \\, \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\right)$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$p'_{c,\\text{new}} \\approx 300 \\times 1.06894142 \\approx 320.682426 \\text{ kPa}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$p'_{c,\\text{new}} \\approx 320.7 \\text{ kPa}$$\nNext, we calculate the horizontal shift of the yield surface center.
