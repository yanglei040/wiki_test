We will proceed by addressing each of the four requested tasks in order.\n\nThe numerical scheme is given by:\n$$\nu^{(1)} = u^{n} + \\Delta t\\, \\mathcal{L}(u^{n})\n$$\n$$\nu^{n+1} = u^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\Big(\\mathcal{L}(u^{n}) + \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})\\Big)\n$$\n\nThe semi-discrete system is $u^{\\prime}(t) = \\mathcal{L}(u(t))$, and the Forward Euler method, $u^{n+1} = u^n + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n)$, is assumed to be monotone for time steps $\\Delta t \\le \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Stability Polynomial $p(z)$**\n\nTo find the stability polynomial, we apply the method to the linear test equation $y^{\\prime} = \\lambda y$, where $\\lambda$ is a complex constant. In this context, the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ corresponds to multiplication by $\\lambda$, so $\\mathcal{L}(y) = \\lambda y$. We define $z = \\Delta t \\lambda$.\n\nFirst, we compute the intermediate stage $y^{(1)}$:\n$$\ny^{(1)} = y^{n} + \\Delta t (\\lambda y^{n}) = (1 + \\Delta t \\lambda) y^{n} = (1 + z) y^{n}\n$$\nNext, we compute the update to the next time level, $y^{n+1}$:\n$$\ny^{n+1} = y^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\Big(\\mathcal{L}(y^{n}) + \\mathcal{L}(y^{(1)})\\Big) = y^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\Big(\\lambda y^{n} + \\lambda y^{(1)}\\Big)\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $y^{(1)}$:\n$$\ny^{n+1} = y^{n} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\Big(\\lambda y^{n} + \\lambda (1 + z) y^{n}\\Big)\n$$\nFactor out $y^n$ from the right-hand side:\n$$\ny^{n+1} = \\left[ 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t \\lambda}{2}\\Big(1 + (1 + z)\\Big) \\right] y^{n} = \\left[ 1 + \\frac{z}{2}(2 + z) \\right] y^{n}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression in the brackets gives the stability polynomial $p(z)$:\n$$\ny^{n+1} = \\left[ 1 + z + \\frac{z^2}{2} \\right] y^{n}\n$$\nThus, the stability polynomial is $p(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{1}{2}z^2$. This is the second-order Taylor series expansion of $\\exp(z)$, as expected for a second-order Runge-Kutta method.\n\n**2. Determination of the Radius of Absolute Monotonicity $R$**\n\nAn explicit Runge-Kutta method with stability polynomial $p(z)$ is defined as absolutely monotone on the interval $[-R, 0]$ if all its derivatives are non-negative for all $z \\in [-R, 0]$. That is, we must have $p^{(k)}(z) \\ge 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 0$ and for all $z \\in [-R, 0]$.\n\nWe compute the derivatives of $p(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{1}{2}z^2$:\n- $p^{(0)}(z) = p(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{1}{2}z^2$\n- $p^{(1)}(z) = p'(z) = 1 + z$\n- $p^{(2)}(z) = p''(z) = 1$\n- $p^{(k)}(z) = 0$ for $k \\ge 3$\n\nNow we check the non-negativity condition for each derivative on the interval $z \\in [-R, 0]$:\n- For $k \\ge 2$, the derivatives $1$ and $0$ are always non-negative, so these impose no restriction on $R$.\n- For $p(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{1}{2}z^2$: This is an upward-opening parabola. Its vertex (minimum) occurs where $p'(z) = 0$, which is at $z=-1$. The minimum value is $p(-1) = 1 - 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(-1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the minimum value is positive, $p(z) > 0$ for all real $z$. This condition imposes no restriction on $R$.\n- For $p'(z) = 1 + z$: We require $1 + z \\ge 0$ for all $z \\in [-R, 0]$. The most restrictive point in this interval is $z = -R$. The condition becomes $1 + (-R) \\ge 0$, which simplifies to $R \\le 1$.\n\nTo satisfy all conditions simultaneously, we must have $R \\le 1$. The radius of absolute monotonicity $R$ is the largest such value, so $R=1$.\n\n**3. Shu–Osher Form and SSP Coefficient $C$**\n\nA method is Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) if it can be expressed as a convex combination of forward Euler steps. The goal is to rewrite the Heun scheme in the Shu-Osher form:\n$u^{(0)} = u^{n}$\n$u^{(i)} = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \\left( \\alpha_{ij} u^{(j)} + \\Delta t \\beta_{ij} \\mathcal{L}(u^{(j)}) \\right)$, with $\\alpha_{ij} \\ge 0, \\beta_{ij} \\ge 0$.\nThe method is SSP if $\\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \\alpha_{ij} = 1$ for each stage $i$. The SSP coefficient $C$ is then given by $C = \\min_{i,j, \\beta_{ij}>0} \\frac{\\alpha_{ij}}{\\beta_{ij}}$.\n\nLet's manipulate the given scheme. We define $u^{(0)}=u^n$. The first stage is a forward Euler step:\n$u^{(1)} = u^n + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n) = u^{(0)} + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(0)})$.\nThis matches the Shu-Osher form for $i=1$ with $\\alpha_{10}=1$ and $\\beta_{10}=1$.\n\nNow we rewrite the final stage, $u^{n+1}$, which we label $u^{(2)}$:\n$u^{n+1} = u^n + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nWe can strategically rewrite this as:\n$u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u^n + \\frac{1}{2}u^n + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nGroup terms:\n$u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u^n + \\frac{1}{2}(u^n + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n)) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nSubstitute $u^{(0)}=u^n$ and $u^{(1)} = u^n + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^n)$:\n$u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u^{(0)} + \\frac{1}{2}u^{(1)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nWe can group the terms related to $u^{(1)}$:\n$u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}u^{(0)} + \\frac{1}{2}(u^{(1)} + \\Delta t \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)}))$\n\nThis expression is a convex combination of $u^{(0)}$ and a forward Euler step applied to $u^{(1)}$. The complete Shu-Osher representation is:\n$u^{(0)} = u^n$\n$u^{(1)} = 1 \\cdot u^{(0)} + \\Delta t \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(u^{(0)})$\n$u^{(2)} = u^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} u^{(0)} + \\frac{1}{2} u^{(1)} + \\Delta t \\cdot 0 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(u^{(0)}) + \\Delta t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\mathcal{L}(u^{(1)})$\nThe coefficients are:\n- For stage $i=1$: $\\alpha_{10}=1, \\beta_{10}=1$.\n- For stage $i=2$: $\\alpha_{20}=1/2, \\alpha_{21}=1/2$, so $\\sum \\alpha_{2j} = 1$. And $\\beta_{20}=0, \\beta_{21}=1/2$.\nAll coefficients $\\alpha_{ij}, \\beta_{ij}$ are non-negative.\nThe SSP coefficient is the minimum of the ratios $\\alpha_{ij}/\\beta_{ij}$ where $\\beta_{ij}>0$:\n$C = \\min\\left( \\frac{\\alpha_{10}}{\\beta_{10}}, \\frac{\\alpha_{21}}{\\beta_{21}} \\right) = \\min\\left( \\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1/2}{1/2} \\right) = \\min(1, 1) = 1$.\nThe SSP coefficient is $C=1$. Monotonicity is guaranteed for $\\Delta t \\le 1 \\cdot \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{FE}}$.\n\n**4. Comparison and Justification of $R$ and $C$**\n\nWe found that the radius of absolute monotonicity is $R=1$ and the SSP coefficient is $C=1$. Thus, for this method, $R=C$.\n\nThis equality is not a coincidence; it is a fundamental result in the theory of SSP methods. The justification relies on the connection between the Shu-Osher representation and the properties of the stability polynomial.\nA method is SSP with coefficient $C$ if it has a Shu-Osher representation where all coefficients $\\alpha_{ij}, \\beta_{ij}$ are non-negative and satisfy $\\alpha_{ij} \\ge C\\beta_{ij}$.\nIt can be shown that if a method is SSP with coefficient $C$, it must be absolutely monotone on $[-C, 0]$. By definition of the radius of absolute monotonicity $R$, this implies the general inequality $R \\ge C$.\n\nFor optimal SSP methods, the SSP coefficient is maximized, and for many important classes of methods (including this one), this leads to the equality $R=C$. Our independent calculations from first principles ($R=1$ from the derivatives of $p(z)$, and $C=1$ from the Shu-Osher form) confirm this equality for the Heun method.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3421294"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals, this practice advances to the widely used third-order Strong Stability Preserving Runge–Kutta method, SSPRK(3,3).

In this case, the maximal scaling factor is $\\gamma=1$. The problem asks for the stage(s) where the scaling factor equals the minimal positive value.
