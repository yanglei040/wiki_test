It is well-posed, providing all necessary physical laws, assumptions, and numerical values for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters given ($n=1.0\\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$ and $k_{B}T_{e}=10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$) are realistic for the core of a fusion-grade tokamak. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe starting point is Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$ \\nabla^{2}\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\varepsilon_{0}} $$\nwhere $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ is the net charge density and $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe plasma is quasi-neutral and composed of electrons and fully ionized hydrogen nuclei (protons). The net charge density is the sum of the ion and electron charge densities:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = e n_{i}(\\mathbf{r}) - e n_{e}(\\mathbf{r}) $$\nHere, $e$ is the elementary charge, $n_{i}$ is the ion number density, and $n_{e}$ is the electron number density. The problem states that the ions form a stationary, uniform background. This means their density is constant and equal to the unperturbed electron density, $n_{i}(\\mathbf{r}) = n_{0}$, which ensures charge neutrality in the absence of a perturbation. Thus,\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = e (n_{0} - n_{e}(\\mathbf{r})) $$\nThe electron density is assumed to follow the Boltzmann relation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles in a potential field at thermal equilibrium:\n$$ n_{e}(\\phi) = n_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T_{e}$ is the electron temperature. Substituting this into the charge density expression gives:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = e n_{0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_{B}T_{e}}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe problem specifies a small-potential linearization, valid for $|\\phi| \\ll k_{B}T_{e}/e$. This allows for the Taylor expansion of the exponential term $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$ for small $x = e\\phi/k_{B}T_{e}$.

The problem's assumption of a spherically symmetric potential from a point test charge $Q$ at the origin allows us to solve this equation in spherical coordinates. For $r > 0$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^{2}\\frac{d\\phi}{dr}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{D}^{2}}\\phi(r) = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n$$ \\phi(r) = C_{1}\\frac{\\exp(-r/\\lambda_{D})}{r} + C_{2}\\frac{\\exp(r/\\lambda_{D})}{r} $$\nThe physical boundary condition that the potential must vanish at infinity ($\\phi(r \\to \\infty) = 0$) requires that the coefficient of the exponentially growing term be zero, so $C_{2}=0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$ \\phi(r) = C_{1}\\frac{\\exp(-r/\\lambda_{D})}{r} $$\nTo determine the constant $C_{1}$, we consider the limit as $r \\to 0$. In this limit, the potential must approach that of an unscreened charge $Q$ in a vacuum, $\\phi_{vac}(r) = Q/(4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}r)$. As $r \\to 0$, $\\exp(-r/\\lambda_{D}) \\to 1$, so our solution becomes $\\phi(r) \\approx C_{1}/r$. Comparing the two gives $C_{1} = Q/(4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0})$. The full potential is thus:\n$$ \\phi(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}r}\\exp(-r/\\lambda_{D}) $$\nThis result demonstrates the exponential shielding of the test charge's potential over a characteristic distance $\\lambda_{D}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the plasma parameter $\\Lambda$, defined as the number of particles in a sphere of radius $\\lambda_{D}$:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}n\\lambda_{D}^{3} $$\nThe problem uses $n$ for the density, which corresponds to the unperturbed density $n_0$.

For a weakly coupled plasma, this ratio must be much less than $1$, i.e., $\\Gamma \\ll 1$, indicating that particle motion is dominated by thermal energy, not electrostatic interactions.\nThe average kinetic energy is of order $K \\sim k_{B}T_{e}$. The average interparticle spacing is $d \\sim n^{-1/3}$. The average potential energy between two electrons is $U \\sim e^2/(4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}d)$. Thus, $\\Gamma \\sim \\frac{e^{2}/(4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}n^{-1/3})}{k_{B}T_{e}}$.\nThe plasma parameter $\\Lambda$ represents the number of particles in a Debye sphere. A large $\\Lambda$ means that the electrostatic field of any given particle is shielded by the collective response of a very large number of other particles. The particle's influence is confined to the Debye sphere, and inside this sphere, there are many other particles. This collective screening prevents strong, close-range binary collisions from dominating the particle dynamics. Instead, particles interact weakly with many other particles simultaneously.\nMathematically, it can be shown that $\\Gamma \\propto \\Lambda^{-2/3}$. Therefore, the condition for weak coupling, $\\Gamma \\ll 1$, is equivalent to the condition $\\Lambda \\gg 1$.\nThe calculated value of $\\Lambda \\approx 1.72 \\times 10^{8}$ is vastly greater than $1$. This indicates that the potential energy of interaction between particles is negligible compared to their kinetic energy. The particles behave almost like an ideal gas, with their trajectories being slightly deflected by long-range, collective fields rather than being strongly governed by short-range, two-body Coulomb collisions.

On these timescales, the much more massive ions can be treated as a stationary, uniform background. We consider a small perturbation to an initially quasineutral plasma, where the unperturbed densities are $n_{i0} = n_{e0} = n_0$. Thus, we set the ion density to its unperturbed value, $n_i \\approx n_0$.\n\nThe electrons, being much lighter and more mobile, will respond to the local electrostatic potential $\\Phi$.

The weakness of the potential implies that the potential energy of an electron in the field is much smaller than its thermal energy, i.e., $|e\\Phi| \\ll k_B T_e$.

The Debye length is thus:\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}} $$\n\nSecond, we define the plasma parameter $\\Lambda$ and discuss its relation to the Coulomb logarithm. The Debye sphere is a sphere with a radius equal to the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. The plasma parameter $\\Lambda$ is defined as the number of electrons contained within a Debye sphere:\n$$ \\Lambda = n_e \\times V_D = n_e \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\lambda_D^3\\right) $$\nThe fundamental assumption of classical plasma theory is that the plasma is weakly coupled. This means that the average potential energy of interaction between neighboring particles is much smaller than their average kinetic energy. This condition is equivalent to requiring that there be many particles in a Debye sphere, i.e., $\\Lambda \\gg 1$.\nThe Coulomb logarithm, properly denoted $\\ln\\Lambda_{coll}$, arises in calculations of collision rates and transport coefficients. It is defined as $\\ln\\Lambda_{coll} = \\ln(\\lambda_D/b_{90})$, where $b_{90}$ is the impact parameter for a $90$-degree scattering event. One can show that $\\Lambda_{coll}$ is proportional to $\\Lambda$. Specifically, $\\Lambda_{coll} = 9\\Lambda$. Thus, $\\ln\\Lambda_{coll} = \\ln(9\\Lambda) = \\ln(9) + \\ln\\Lambda$. In the weakly coupled limit where $\\Lambda \\gg 1$, $\\ln\\Lambda$ is a large number (typically $15-20$ for fusion plasmas), and the $\\ln(9) \\approx 2.2$ term is a small correction. Therefore, under the classical, weakly coupled assumption ($\\Lambda \\gg 1$), the Coulomb logarithm is often approximated by the natural logarithm of the plasma parameter: $\\ln\\Lambda_{coll} \\approx \\ln\\Lambda$.\n\nThird, we derive the error propagation formulas. The general formula for the variance of a function $f(x_1, x_2)$ is $(\\delta f)^2 \\approx (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1})^2 (\\delta x_1)^2 + (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2})^2 (\\delta x_2)^2 + 2\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} \\rho_{12} \\delta x_1 \\delta x_2$, where $\\rho_{12}$ is the correlation coefficient. A more direct method for power-law functions is to use logarithmic differentials.\nFor the Debye length, $\\lambda_D \\propto n_e^{-1/2} T_e^{1/2}$. Taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(\\lambda_D) = C - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_e) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(T_e) $$\nThe differential is $d(\\ln\\lambda_D) = \\frac{d\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dn_e}{n_e} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dT_e}{T_e}$. The variance of the relative uncertainty is found by squaring this expression and replacing differentials with standard uncertainties:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\delta \\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D}\\right)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\rho_{n_e T_e}\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\rho_{n_e T_e}$ is the correlation coefficient between the measurements of $n_e$ and $T_e$. This gives the general form:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\delta \\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{n_e T_e}\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right) $$\nFor the given case of negligible correlation, $\\rho_{n_e T_e} = 0$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\delta \\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right)^2\\right] $$\nNext, for the uncertainty in $\\ln\\Lambda$. First, we express $\\Lambda$ in terms of $n_e$ and $T_e$:\n$$ \\Lambda = n_e \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\lambda_D^3 = n_e \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\propto n_e^{-1/2} T_e^{3/2} $$\nLet $Y = \\ln\\Lambda$. Then $Y = \\ln(C') - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(n_e) + \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(T_e)$. The differential is:\n$$ dY = d(\\ln\\Lambda) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dn_e}{n_e} + \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{dT_e}{T_e} $$\nThe variance $(\\delta Y)^2 = (\\delta(\\ln\\Lambda))^2$ is found by squaring and averaging:\n$$ (\\delta(\\ln\\Lambda))^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\rho_{n_e T_e}\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right) $$\nThis yields the general form for the uncertainty in $\\ln\\Lambda$:\n$$ (\\delta(\\ln\\Lambda))^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)^2 + \\frac{9}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right)^2 - \\frac{3}{2}\\rho_{n_e T_e}\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right) $$\nFor the case of negligible correlation ($\\rho_{n_e T_e} = 0$):\n$$ (\\delta(\\ln\\Lambda))^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e}\\right)^2 + \\frac{9}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e}{T_e}\\right)^2 $$\n\nFourth, we provide a brief error budget. For the uncertainty in $\\lambda_D$, the squared relative uncertainties in $n_e$ and $T_e$ contribute with equal weight factors of $1/4$. Given $\\delta T_e/T_e = 0.07$ and $\\delta n_e/n_e = 0.03$, the contribution from $T_e$ will be larger since $(0.07)^2 > (0.03)^2$. Specifically, the ratio of the temperature contribution to the density contribution is $(\\delta T_e/T_e)^2 / (\\delta n_e/n_e)^2 = (0.07/0.03)^2 \\approx 5.4$. Thus, the uncertainty in $T_e$ is the dominant source of error for $\\lambda_D$.\nFor the uncertainty in $\\ln\\Lambda$, the contribution from the relative uncertainty in $T_e$ is weighted by a factor of $9/4$, while the contribution from $n_e$ is weighted by $1/4$. The weighting factor for the temperature uncertainty is $9$ times larger than for the density uncertainty. The ratio of the contributions to the total variance is:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Term from }T_e}{\\text{Term from }n_e} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{4}(\\delta T_e/T_e)^2}{\\frac{1}{4}(\\delta n_e/n_e)^2} = 9\\left(\\frac{\\delta T_e/T_e}{\\delta n_e/n_e}\\right)^2 = 9\\left(\\frac{0.07}{0.03}\\right)^2 = 9\\left(\\frac{49}{9}\\right) = 49 $$\nThe contribution from the uncertainty in electron temperature is $49$ times greater than that from the electron density. Therefore, the uncertainty in $\\ln\\Lambda$ is overwhelmingly dominated by the uncertainty in $T_e$. This high sensitivity to temperature uncertainty is a critical consideration in fusion transport modeling, where quantities like the collision frequency depend on $\\ln\\Lambda$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the numerical value for the standard uncertainty in $\\ln\\Lambda$, which is $\\delta(\\ln\\Lambda)$. Using the derived formula for zero correlation and the given uncertainty values:\n$$ (\\delta(\\ln\\Lambda))^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(0.03\\right)^2 + \\frac{9}{4}\\left(0.07\\right)^2 $$\n$$ (\\delta(\\ln\\Lambda))^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(0.0009) + \\frac{9}{4}(0.0049) = 0.000225 + 0.011025 = 0.01125 $$\nThe standard uncertainty is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\delta(\\ln\\Lambda) = \\sqrt{0.01125} \\approx 0.106066017... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.1061$.\nThe temperature unit conversion ($1\\ \\mathrm{keV} \\approx 1.160 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{K}$, or more directly $1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}$) and the values of the physical constants are not needed for this final calculation, as it depends only on the relative uncertainties.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1061}$$", "id": "3694360"}]}
