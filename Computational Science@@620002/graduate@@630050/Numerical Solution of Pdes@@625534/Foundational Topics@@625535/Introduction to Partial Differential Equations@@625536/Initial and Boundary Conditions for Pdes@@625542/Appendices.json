This implies that for $a > 0$ the left boundary at $x=0$ is an inflow boundary, and the physically correct inflow condition is to prescribe the incoming characteristic state $u(0,t) = u_{\\text{in}}(t)$.\n\nYou discretize the domain with a uniform finite volume mesh of cell width $h$, using cell centers at $x_{i} = (i - \\tfrac{1}{2})h$ for $i = 1,2,\\dots,N$, and a single ghost cell indexed by $i=0$ centered at $x_{0} = -\\tfrac{1}{2}h$ outside the domain. To compute the numerical flux at the left boundary face located at $x = 0$ using an upwind Godunov flux for $a > 0$, you reconstruct the left state at the face from the adjacent cell-centered data by a second-order one-dimensional linear reconstruction. On a uniform grid, this reconstruction reduces to evaluating the face value as the arithmetic average of the adjacent cell-centered values, i.e., $u_{L}^{\\text{face}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\big(u_{0}^{n} + u_{1}^{n}\\big)$, where $u_{0}^{n}$ is the ghost cell value and $u_{1}^{n}$ is the first interior cell value at time $t^{n}$.\n\nAssume the inflow boundary condition is $u_{\\text{in}}(t) = 1 + \\sin(t) + \\exp(-t)$ with the angle in radians.

The method of characteristics is used to analyze the propagation of information. The characteristic curves are defined by the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\frac{dx}{dt} = a$. The solution to this ODE is $x(t) = at + x_{0}$, where $x_{0}$ is the position of the characteristic at time $t=0$. The total derivative of the solution $u(x(t), t)$ along such a characteristic curve is given by $\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{dx}{dt} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.

This implies that the value of $u$ is constant along the characteristic curves; $u$ is a Riemann invariant.\n\nSince $a > 0$, the characteristic curves have a positive slope in the $(x,t)$-plane. They propagate from left to right, carrying information into the spatial domain $x \\in (0,1)$ through the left boundary at $x=0$. Therefore, the value of the solution at the boundary $x=0$ for any time $t > 0$ is determined by information originating from the region $x  0$. This information is external to the computational domain and must be supplied as a boundary condition. This is the physical justification for prescribing an inflow condition $u(0,t) = u_{\\text{in}}(t)$.\n\nFor a numerical scheme like the Godunov method, which is based on solving Riemann problems at cell interfaces, the upwind principle dictates that for $a > 0$, the state at a cell interface is determined by the state on the left (the \"upwind\" side). At the domain's left boundary face, $x=0$, this upwind state is precisely the physical inflow value, $u_{\\text{in}}(t)$. Thus, the numerical flux through the boundary face must be based on $u_{\\text{in}}(t)$.\n\nThe problem describes a numerical procedure to enforce this condition using a ghost cell. The value at the boundary face, $x=0$, is reconstructed from the values in the first interior cell (centered at $x_1 = (1-\\frac{1}{2})h = \\frac{h}{2}$) and a ghost cell (centered at $x_0 = (0-\\frac{1}{2})h = -\\frac{h}{2}$).

A stationary solution $v(x)$ on $x0$ must satisfy the ODE $(\\frac{1}{2}v^2)_x = \\nu v_{xx}$. We assume this layer connects the boundary state $v(0)=u_L$ to the far-field state $v(\\infty)=u_R$. Integrating the ODE from $x$ to $\\infty$ yields $\\nu v_x(x) - \\frac{1}{2}v(x)^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}v(\\infty)^2$, assuming $v_x(\\infty)=0$. Thus, the boundary layer profile is governed by:\n$$\n\\nu v_x = \\frac{1}{2}(v^2 - u_R^2)\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution $v(x)$ to exist on $[0, \\infty)$ and converge to $u_R$ as $x\\to\\infty$, $v=u_R$ must be a stable fixed point of the dynamical system $v' = g(v) = \\frac{1}{2\\nu}(v^2 - u_R^2)$. The stability is determined by $g'(u_R) = \\frac{u_R}{\\nu}$. Stability requires $g'(u_R)  0$, which implies $u_R  0$. If $u_R \\ge 0$, no stationary boundary layer connecting to $u_R$ can form (unless $u_L=u_R$).\n\nIf $u_R  0$, the fixed point $v=u_R$ is stable, while $v=-u_R  0$ is unstable. A solution $v(x)$ starting at $v(0)=u_L$ converges to $u_R$ if and only if $u_L$ is in the basin of attraction of $u_R$, which is $(-\\infty, -u_R)$. Therefore, a stationary boundary layer exists if and only if $u_R  0$ and $u_L  -u_R$.\n\nWe examine the monotonicity of this layer and its consistency with the entropy solution. The sign of $v_x$ is the sign of $v^2-u_R^2 = (v-u_R)(v+u_R)$. Since $u_R0$, $v_x  0$ for $v \\in (u_R, -u_R)$ and $v_x  0$ for $v  u_R$ or $v  -u_R$.\n- If $u_R  u_L  -u_R$, the solution must be decreasing to reach $u_R$, so $v_x  0$. This is satisfied for $v(x) \\in (u_R, u_L)$. This case corresponds to $u_L  u_R$, $u_R  0$, and $u_L+u_R  0$. This is the shock case with $s0$, for which we found $u^{\\ast}=u_R$. The decreasing (shock-like) profile is consistent with the entropy condition, which requires characteristics to enter the shock. The monotonic decrease from $u_L$ to $u_R$ is a viscous realization of this condition.\n- If $u_L = -u_R$, this is the stationary shock case $s=0$. The layer is also monotone decreasing.\n- If $u_L  u_R$, which given $u_R0$ means $u_L  u_R  0$, the solution must be increasing to reach $u_R$ from $u_L$, so $v_x  0$. This is satisfied for $v(x) \\in (u_L, u_R)$ since $v(x)  u_R  0$. This corresponds to the rarefaction case with the fan moving left, for which $u^{\\ast}=u_R$. The profile is monotonic increasing. This is not a shock profile, but a viscous layer where convection (all characteristics point to the left, towards $x=0$) is balanced by diffusion.\nIn all other parameter regimes ($u_R \\ge 0$ or ($u_R  0$ and $u_L \\ge -u_R$)), no stationary boundary layer solution exists. This is consistent with the inviscid analysis, which shows that in these regimes, waves ($s0$ shock or rarefaction fan with positive speeds) propagate into the domain, preventing the formation of a steady state attached to the boundary.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\nu^{\\ast}(u_{L}, u_{R}) = \\begin{cases} u_{L}  \\text{if } u_{L}  u_{R} \\text{ and } u_{L}+u_{R}  0 \\\\ u_{R}  \\text{if } u_{L}  u_{R} \\text{ and } u_{L}+u_{R} \\le 0 \\\\ u_{L}  \\text{if } 0  u_{L} \\le u_{R} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } u_{L} \\le 0 \\leq u_{R} \\\\ u_{R}  \\text{if } u_{L} \\le u_{R}  0 \\end{cases}\n}\n$$", "id": "3408745"}]}
