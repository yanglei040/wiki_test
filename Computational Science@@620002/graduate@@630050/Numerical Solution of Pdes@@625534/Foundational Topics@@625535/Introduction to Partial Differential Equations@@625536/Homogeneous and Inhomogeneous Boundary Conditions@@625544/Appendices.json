The governing equation is the one-dimensional Poisson equation, a fundamental elliptic PDE. The boundary conditions are of Neumann type, one of which is inhomogeneous. The forcing function is a simple, well-behaved trigonometric function. The task requires applying a standard technique—transformation to homogeneous boundary conditions—and identifying a key component of the problem's structure, namely the compatibility condition and the related constant offset in the forcing term. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed (it is solvable, as will be shown), objective, and contains all necessary information. Thus, the problem is valid.\n\nThe problem is to solve the a Poisson equation on the interval $x \\in (0, \\pi)$:\n$$-u''(x) = f(x)$$\nwith the forcing function $f(x) = 1 + \\cos(2x)$ and subject to the boundary conditions:\n$$u'(0) = \\pi, \\quad u'(\\pi) = 0$$\n\nFirst, we must verify the compatibility condition for the original problem. Integrating the PDE from $x=0$ to $x=\\pi$:\n$$-\\int_{0}^{\\pi} u''(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} f(x) \\, dx$$\nUsing the fundamental theorem of calculus on the left-hand side:\n$$- [u'(x)]_{0}^{\\pi} = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} f(x) \\, dx$$\n$$-(u'(\\pi) - u'(0)) = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} f(x) \\, dx$$\n$$u'(0) - u'(\\pi) = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} f(x) \\, dx$$\nSubstituting the given boundary conditions, the left-hand side is $\\pi - 0 = \\pi$.\nFor the right-hand side, we integrate the given forcing function:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} (1 + \\cos(2x)) \\, dx = \\left[x + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2x)\\right]_{0}^{\\pi} = \\left(\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\pi)\\right) - \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(0)\\right) = \\pi$$\nSince $\\pi = \\pi$, the compatibility condition is satisfied, and a solution $u(x)$ exists (and is unique up to an additive constant).\n\nThe problem requires transforming the problem to one with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. We introduce a decomposition $u(x) = w(x) + v(x)$, where $v(x)$ is a simple function chosen to satisfy the inhomogeneous boundary conditions, and $w(x)$ will be the new unknown function. We require $w(x)$ to satisfy homogeneous Neumann conditions: $w'(0) = 0$ and $w'(\\pi) = 0$.\nThe conditions for $v(x)$ are thus:\n$$w'(0) = u'(0) - v'(0) = \\pi - v'(0) = 0 \\implies v'(0) = \\pi$$\n$$w'(\\pi) = u'(\\pi) - v'(\\pi) = 0 - v'(\\pi) = 0 \\implies v'(\\pi) = 0$$\nLet's choose a simple polynomial for $v(x)$, such as $v(x) = ax^2 + bx$. Its derivative is $v'(x) = 2ax + b$.\nApplying the conditions:\n$$v'(0) = b = \\pi$$\n$$v'(\\pi) = 2a\\pi + b = 0 \\implies 2a\\pi + \\pi = 0 \\implies 2a = -1 \\implies a = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nSo, a suitable function is $v(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\pi x$. We can arbitrarily set the constant term to zero.\n\nNow, we substitute $u(x) = w(x) + v(x)$ into the original PDE:\n$$-(w''(x) + v''(x)) = f(x)$$\n$$-w''(x) = f(x) + v''(x)$$\nWe need the second derivative of $v(x)$. From $v'(x) = -x + \\pi$, we find $v''(x) = -1$.\nThe PDE for the transformed unknown $w(x)$ is:\n$$-w''(x) = f(x) - 1$$\nSubstituting $f(x) = 1 + \\cos(2x)$, the new forcing term, let's call it $h(x)$, is:\n$$h(x) = (1 + \\cos(2x)) - 1 = \\cos(2x)$$\nSo, the transformed problem for $w(x)$ is:\n$$-w''(x) = \\cos(2x), \\quad x \\in (0, \\pi)$$\nsubject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions:\n$$w'(0) = 0, \\quad w'(\\pi) = 0$$\n\nThis is a \"homogeneous Neumann spectral problem.\" For it to be solvable, the forcing term $h(x)$ must be orthogonal to the null space of the operator $-d^2/dx^2$ with homogeneous Neumann BCs. The null space is spanned by the constant function $\\phi_0(x) = 1$. The solvability (or compatibility) condition is therefore:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} h(x) \\, dx = 0$$\nLet's verify this for our derived $h(x)$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos(2x) \\, dx = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2x)\\right]_{0}^{\\pi} = 0$$\nThe condition is satisfied, as expected.\n\nThe question asks for the \"constant (the steady-state offset) that must be removed from the forcing to yield a solvable homogeneous Neumann spectral problem\".\nThe process of transforming the problem from $u(x)$ to $w(x)$ resulted in a new forcing term $h(x) = f(x) - 1$. This transformation can be interpreted as taking the original forcing function $f(x)$ and removing a constant to produce the forcing function $h(x)$ for the solvable homogeneous problem. The constant that is removed is $1$.\n\nThis constant, $1$, is also the \"steady-state offset\" or average value of the original forcing function $f(x)$ over the interval $(0, \\pi)$:\n$$\\text{Average}(f) = \\frac{1}{\\pi-0} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} f(x) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} (1 + \\cos(2x)) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\pi} (\\pi) = 1$$\nThe transformation procedure effectively subtracts the mean of the original forcing function, which is made possible by the boundary data satisfying the original compatibility condition.

The homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for diffusion contribute nothing to counteract this ($F^{(d)}_{1/2}=F^{(d)}_{N+1/2}=0$). For a state where $u_1 \\ne 0$ and all other terms are zero or small, $\\frac{dE}{dt}$ can be positive. Thus, energy stability $\\frac{dE}{dt} \\le 0$ cannot be guaranteed.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B.

Switching to first-order upwinding for the interior convection flux adds an interior dissipation term that, by itself and without any boundary penalization, guarantees $\\tfrac{dE}{dt}\\le 0$ for all states under homogeneous Neumann diffusion.**\n\nThis option uses upwind convection ($F^{(c)}_{i+1/2} = a u_i$) and Neumann BCs. The interior convection sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (u_{i+1}-u_i) (a u_i) = a \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (u_i u_{i+1} - u_i^2)\n$$\nUsing the identity $u_i u_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_i^2+u_{i+1}^2) - \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i+1}-u_i)^2$, the sum is $a \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(u_{i+1}^2-u_i^2) - \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i+1}-u_i)^2\\right) = \\frac{a}{2}(u_N^2 - u_1^2) - \\frac{a}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}(u_{i+1}-u_i)^2$.\nThe boundary fluxes are the same as in case A: $F_{1/2} = a u_1$ and $F_{N+1/2} = a u_N$.\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = u_1(a u_1) - u_N(a u_N) + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}(u_N^2 - u_1^2) - \\frac{a}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}(u_{i+1}-u_i)^2\\right) - \\frac{\\nu}{h} \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (u_{i+1}-u_i)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{a}{2}u_1^2 - \\frac{a}{2}u_N^2 - \\left(\\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{\\nu}{h}\\right)\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}(u_{i+1}-u_i)^2\n$$\nUpwinding does add an interior dissipation term $-\\frac{a}{2}\\sum(u_{i+1}-u_i)^2$, as stated. However, the boundary energy production term $\\frac{a}{2}u_1^2$ remains unchanged. Since this term can be positive, the scheme is not guaranteed to be stable for all states $u(t)$. Therefore, the upwinding in the interior is insufficient by itself to guarantee stability.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. Consider the fully discrete backward Euler method applied to the diffusion equation $u_t=\\nu u_{xx}$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, discretized in space by the same finite volume method.

The matrix in question is the spatial discretization matrix $A_s$ (or its negative, which appears in steady-state problems and affects diagonal dominance properties). Let's analyze $-A_s$.\nWith Neumann BCs at both ends, the matrix $-A_s$ (scaled by $h^2/\\nu$) is:\n$$\n-A_{s, \\text{Neumann}}' = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & & \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 & \\\\ & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots \\\\ & & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe vector $[1, 1, \\dots, 1]^T$ is in the nullspace of $A_{s, \\text{Neumann}}$, so the corresponding statement about the nullspace is correct. The matrix is singular.\nAdding a Robin BC ($\\gamma>0$) at $x=1$ changes the last row. The matrix $-A_s$ (scaled) becomes:\n$$\n-A_{s, \\text{Robin}}' = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & & \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 & \\\\ & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots \\\\ & & -1 & 1+h\\gamma/\\nu \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is non-singular, removing the nullspace of constants. This part is correct.\nHowever, the statement claims the matrix becomes \"strictly diagonally dominant\" (SDD).\nFor row 1: $|1| = |-1|$, so it's not strictly diagonally dominant.\nFor interior rows $i$: $|2| = |-1|+|-1|$, not strictly diagonally dominant.\nThe matrix is weakly diagonally dominant and irreducible, with one strictly dominant row (the last one). These properties are sufficient to prove it is a non-singular M-matrix, which in turn guarantees uniqueness and monotonicity. But the claim that it is *strictly* diagonally dominant is false. Since the reasoning presented (\"...makes the matrix strictly diagonally dominant, which guarantees...\") is flawed, the statement is incorrect.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**E.

Define the SBP operator components $(H,Q,D)$ as follows:\n- The norm matrix $H$ is diagonal with $$H = h\\,\\mathrm{diag}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1, \\dots, 1, \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right).$$\n- The first-derivative operator is $D=H^{-1}Q$, with $Q+Q^\\top = B$, where $$B = \\mathrm{diag}(-1, 0, \\dots, 0, 1).$$\n- In the interior, $Q$ corresponds to the standard second-order central difference stencil, and at the boundaries it satisfies the SBP property. Explicitly, for $i=1,\\dots,N-2$,\n$$Q_{i,i+1}=\\tfrac{1}{2},\\quad Q_{i,i-1}=-\\tfrac{1}{2},$$\nand at the boundaries,\n$$Q_{0,0}=-\\tfrac{1}{2},\\quad Q_{0,1}=\\tfrac{1}{2},\\qquad Q_{N-1,N-2}=-\\tfrac{1}{2},\\quad Q_{N-1,N-1}=\\tfrac{1}{2}.$$\n\nForm the semi-discrete system using the SBP-SAT approach. The semi-discrete ordinary differential equation (ODE) should be\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\boldsymbol{u}(t) = -a\\,D\\,\\boldsymbol{u}(t) + H^{-1}\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_0\\,\\tau\\left(g(t)-u_0(t)\\right),$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{u}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ is the grid function, $u_0(t)$ is its first component, $\\boldsymbol{e}_0 = (1,0,\\dots,0)^\\top$, and $\\tau$ is a penalty parameter to be chosen. Interpret $g(t)$ as the inhomogeneous boundary data; in this problem set $g(t) = \\sin(2\\pi t)$ with the argument taken in radians.\n\nImplement a fourth-order explicit Runge–Kutta time integrator for the semi-discrete ODE and choose the time step according to a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) strategy that respects the advection speed and grid spacing, $$\\Delta t = 0.4\\,\\frac{h}{|a|}.$$ Integrate up to final time $T=1$. With the specified initial condition and inflow boundary condition, the exact solution for $a>0$ on $[0,1]$ at time $T$ is\n$$u_{\\mathrm{exact}}(x,T) = g\\!\\left(T - \\frac{x}{a}\\right) = \\sin\\!\\left(2\\pi\\left(T - \\frac{x}{a}\\right)\\right),$$\nsince all characteristics originate at the boundary for $T \\ge x/a$ and the initial condition is zero. Use this exact solution to compute a discrete $L^2$ error norm weighted by $H$, $$\\|e\\|_{H} = \\sqrt{ \\boldsymbol{e}^\\top H \\boldsymbol{e} },$$ where $\\boldsymbol{e}$ is the pointwise error vector.\n\nStability analysis must be conducted using the energy method. Derive the condition on $\\tau$ that ensures the semi-discrete energy $E(t)=\\boldsymbol{u}(t)^\\top H \\boldsymbol{u}(t)$ does not grow due to boundary terms in the homogeneous case $g(t)\\equiv 0$, and verify it computationally by examining the symmetric part of the generator with $g=0$. Specifically, for the homogeneous operator\n$$L_{\\mathrm{hom}} = -a\\,D - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}}\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_0 \\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top,$$\ncompute the symmetric matrix $$M = H L_{\\mathrm{hom}} + L_{\\mathrm{hom}}^\\top H,$$ and check whether its largest eigenvalue is nonpositive to within numerical tolerance; this is equivalent to the semi-discrete energy being nonincreasing for $g=0$.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Fix $a=1$ and $T=1$.\n- Consider the following penalty parameters: $\\tau = 0.4\\,a$, $\\tau = 0.5\\,a$, $\\tau = 1.0\\,a$, and $\\tau = 2.0\\,a$.\n- For each $\\tau$, compute the discrete $L^2$ error at $T$ for $N\\in\\{50, 100, 200\\}$, and estimate the observed order of accuracy $$p \\approx \\frac{\\log\\left(\\|e_{N_2}\\|_H / \\|e_{N_3}\\|_H\\right)}{\\log\\left(h_{N_2}/h_{N_3}\\right)}$$ using the two finest grids $N_2=100$ and $N_3=200$.\n- For each $\\tau$, compute a boolean stability indicator by checking if the largest eigenvalue of $M$ is $\\le 10^{-12}$.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The first four entries must be the observed orders $p$ for $\\tau = 0.4\\,a$, $0.5\\,a$, $1.0\\,a$, $2.0\\,a$ (in that order). The next four entries must be the corresponding boolean stability indicators for the homogeneous operator (in the same $\\tau$ order). For example, the output should look like\n$$[\\text{p}_{0.4a},\\text{p}_{0.5a},\\text{p}_{1.0a},\\text{p}_{2.0a},\\text{s}_{0.4a},\\text{s}_{0.5a},\\text{s}_{1.0a},\\text{s}_{2.0a}],$$\nwhere $\\text{p}_{\\cdot}$ are floating-point numbers and $\\text{s}_{\\cdot}$ are booleans.", "solution": "The problem requires the numerical solution of the one-dimensional linear advection equation, $u_t + a\\,u_x = 0$, using a Summation-By-Parts (SBP) and Simultaneous-Approximation-Term (SAT) finite difference method. This involves deriving a stability condition for the penalty parameter $\\tau$, implementing the numerical scheme with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta time integrator, and evaluating the method's accuracy and stability for a given set of parameters.\n\n### Stability Analysis using the Energy Method\n\nThe stability of the semi-discrete scheme is analyzed using the energy method for the homogeneous case, where the boundary data is $g(t) \\equiv 0$. The semi-discrete system is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\boldsymbol{u}(t) = -a\\,D\\,\\boldsymbol{u}(t) - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}} \\boldsymbol{e}_0 \\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top \\boldsymbol{u}(t) $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{u}(t)$ is the vector of nodal values of the solution, $D$ is the SBP first-derivative operator, $H$ is the diagonal norm matrix, $\\tau$ is the penalty parameter, $H_{00}$ is the first diagonal element of $H$, and $\\boldsymbol{e}_0 = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)^\\top$.\n\nThe discrete energy of the solution is defined as $E(t) = \\boldsymbol{u}(t)^\\top H \\boldsymbol{u}(t)$. A stable scheme requires the energy to be non-increasing in time, i.e., $\\frac{dE}{dt} \\le 0$. The time derivative of the energy is:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{u}^\\top}{dt} H \\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{u}^\\top H \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{u}}{dt} $$\nSubstituting the semi-discrete ODE into this expression yields:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\left(-a\\,D\\,\\boldsymbol{u} - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}} \\boldsymbol{e}_0 \\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top \\boldsymbol{u}\\right)^\\top H \\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{u}^\\top H \\left(-a\\,D\\,\\boldsymbol{u} - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}} \\boldsymbol{e}_0 \\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top \\boldsymbol{u}\\right) $$\nUsing the property that $H$ is symmetric ($H=H^\\top$) and $(AB)^\\top = B^\\top A^\\top$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -a\\,\\boldsymbol{u}^\\top D^\\top H \\boldsymbol{u} - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}} \\boldsymbol{u}^\\top \\boldsymbol{e}_0 \\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top H \\boldsymbol{u} - a\\,\\boldsymbol{u}^\\top H D\\,\\boldsymbol{u} - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}} \\boldsymbol{u}^\\top H \\boldsymbol{e}_0 \\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top \\boldsymbol{u} $$\nThe SBP operator is defined as $D = H^{-1}Q$, which implies $HD = Q$ and $D^\\top H = (H^{-1}Q)^\\top H = Q^\\top H^{-1} H = Q^\\top$. The terms involving $\\tau$ can be simplified by noting that $H \\boldsymbol{e}_0 = H_{00}\\boldsymbol{e}_0$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top H = H_{00}\\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top$. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\top H \\boldsymbol{e}_0 \\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top \\boldsymbol{u} = H_{00} (\\boldsymbol{u}^\\top \\boldsymbol{e}_0) (\\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top \\boldsymbol{u}) = H_{00} u_0^2$. The expression for $\\frac{dE}{dt}$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -a\\,\\boldsymbol{u}^\\top (Q^\\top + Q)\\,\\boldsymbol{u} - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}} (H_{00} u_0^2) - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}} (H_{00} u_0^2) = -a\\,\\boldsymbol{u}^\\top (Q^\\top + Q)\\,\\boldsymbol{u} - 2\\tau u_0^2 $$\nThe SBP property states $Q+Q^\\top = B = \\mathrm{diag}(-1, 0, \\dots, 0, 1)$. Also, $u_0^2 = \\boldsymbol{u}^\\top \\boldsymbol{e}_0\\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top \\boldsymbol{u}$. Substituting these into the energy rate equation gives:\n$$ \\fracdE}{dt} = -a\\,\\boldsymbol{u}^\\top (\\boldsymbol{e}_{N-1}\\boldsymbol{e}_{N-1}^\\top - \\boldsymbol{e}_0\\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top)\\,\\boldsymbol{u} - 2\\tau \\boldsymbol{u}^\\top \\boldsymbol{e}_0\\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top \\boldsymbol{u} $$\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -a(u_{N-1}^2 - u_0^2) - 2\\tau u_0^2 = (a-2\\tau)u_0^2 - a\\,u_{N-1}^2 $$\nFor stability, we require $\\frac{dE}{dt} \\le 0$ for all possible solutions $\\boldsymbol{u}$. The term $-a\\,u_{N-1}^2$ represents energy leaving the domain at the outflow boundary ($x=1$), which is dissipative for $a>0$. The term $(a-2\\tau)u_0^2$ is related to the inflow boundary at $x=0$. To prevent this term from creating energy, its coefficient must be non-positive. This leads to the stability condition:\n$$ a - 2\\tau \\le 0 \\implies \\tau \\ge \\frac{a}{2} $$\nFor the given test cases with $a=1$, stability is expected for $\\tau \\in \\{0.5, 1.0, 2.0\\}$, while the case $\\tau=0.4$ is expected to be unstable.\n\nThis analytical result can be confirmed computationally. The energy rate is $\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{u}^\\top M \\boldsymbol{u}$, where $M = H L_{\\mathrm{hom}} + L_{\\mathrm{hom}}^\\top H$ with $L_{\\mathrm{hom}} = -a D - \\frac{\\tau}{H_{00}}\\boldsymbol{e}_0\\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top$. As shown in the derivation, $M = (a - 2\\tau) \\boldsymbol{e}_0 \\boldsymbol{e}_0^\\top - a \\boldsymbol{e}_{N-1} \\boldsymbol{e}_{N-1}^\\top$. This is a diagonal matrix $M = \\mathrm{diag}(a-2\\tau, 0, \\dots, 0, -a)$. The condition $\\frac{dE}{dt} \\le 0$ requires $M$ to be negative semi-definite, which means its largest eigenvalue must be non-positive. The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, so $\\lambda_{\\max}(M) = \\max(a-2\\tau, 0, -a)$. Given $a=1>0$, this simplifies to $\\lambda_{\\max}(M) = \\max(a-2\\tau, 0)$. This is non-positive if and only if $a-2\\tau \\le 0$, which recovers the same stability condition $\\tau \\ge a/2$.\n\n### Numerical Implementation\n\nThe core of the implementation consists of the following steps:\n1.  **Grid and Matrix Construction**: For a given number of grid points $N$, we define the uniform grid $x_i = i h$ with spacing $h=1/(N-1)$. The diagonal norm matrix $H$ and the operator matrix $Q$ are constructed according to their definitions. The derivative operator is then $D = H^{-1}Q$.\n2.  **Semi-Discrete System**: The right-hand side (RHS) of the ODE system $\\frac{d}{dt}\\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{f}(t, \\boldsymbol{u})$ is implemented as:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{f}(t, \\boldsymbol{u}) = -a\\,D\\,\\boldsymbol{u}(t) + H^{-1}\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_0\\,\\tau\\left(g(t)-u_0(t)\\right) $$\n    where $g(t) = \\sin(2\\pi t)$.\n3.  **Time Integration**: The ODE system is integrated from $t=0$ to $t=T$ using the classical fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. The time step $\\Delta t$ is chosen based on the provided CFL condition, $\\Delta t = 0.4\\,h/|a|$. The initial condition is $\\boldsymbol{u}(0) = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n4.  **Error Calculation**: At the final time $T=1$, the numerical solution $\\boldsymbol{u}(T)$ is compared to the exact solution vector $\\boldsymbol{u}_{\\text{exact}}(T)$ whose components are $u_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, T) = \\sin(2\\pi(T-x_i/a))$. The error vector is $\\boldsymbol{e} = \\boldsymbol{u}(T) - \\boldsymbol{u}_{\\text{exact}}(T)$. The discrete weighted $L^2$ error is computed as $\\|e\\|_H = \\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{e}^\\top H \\boldsymbol{e}}$.\n5.  **Order of Accuracy**: The observed order of accuracy, $p$, is estimated using the errors from simulations on two successively refined grids, $N_2=100$ and $N_3=200$, via the formula:\n    $$ p \\approx \\frac{\\log\\left(\\|e_{N_2}\\|_H / \\|e_{N_3}\\|_H\\right)}{\\log\\left(h_{N_2}/h_{N_3}\\right)} $$\n    The SBP operator is second-order accurate, so we expect $p \\approx 2$ for stable choices of $\\tau$.\n6.  **Stability Check**: For each value of $\\tau$, the stability matrix $M$ is constructed, and its largest eigenvalue is computed. The scheme is considered stable if this eigenvalue is non-positive within a small tolerance ($10^{-12}$).\n\nThe program will execute this procedure for each specified penalty parameter $\\tau$ and report the computed order of accuracy and the boolean stability indicator.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\text{[nan,1.97157692131923,1.97180290117325,1.97235552395679,False,True,True,True]}}\n$$", "id": "3403988"}]}
