The internal virtual work, $\\delta W_{\\text{int}}$, is given by the integral of the stress $\\sigma$ multiplied by the virtual strain $\\delta\\varepsilon$ over the element's volume:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{int}} = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} \\sigma\\,\\delta\\varepsilon\\,A\\,dx $$\nTo formulate the element stiffness matrix, we must express all quantities in terms of the nodal degrees of freedom $d$ and the parent coordinate $\\xi \\in [-1, 1]$.\n\nThe displacement field $u(x)$ is approximated using the shape functions $N(\\xi)$ and nodal displacements $d = \\begin{bmatrix} d_1  d_2 \\end{bmatrix}^T$:\n$$ u_h(x(\\xi)) = N(\\xi)d = N_1(\\xi)d_1 + N_2(\\xi)d_2 $$\nThe strain $\\varepsilon$ is the spatial derivative of the displacement, $\\varepsilon = \\frac{du}{dx}$. Using the chain rule, we can relate derivatives with respect to the physical coordinate $x$ and the parent coordinate $\\xi$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{d\\xi} = \\frac{du}{dx} \\frac{dx}{d\\xi} = \\varepsilon J(\\xi) $$\nwhere $J(\\xi) = \\frac{dx}{d\\xi}$ is the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation. This gives the strain as:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{J(\\xi)}\\frac{du}{d\\xi} $$\nThe derivative of the displacement with respect to $\\xi$ is:\n$$ \\frac{du}{d\\xi} = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}(N(\\xi)d) = \\left(\\frac{dN(\\xi)}{d\\xi}\\right)d $$\nLet's denote the matrix of shape function derivatives as $N_{,\\xi} \\equiv \\frac{dN}{d\\xi}$. Then the strain can be written as:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\left(\\frac{1}{J(\\xi)}N_{,\\xi}\\right) d = B(\\xi)d $$\nwhere $B(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{J(\\xi)}N_{,\\xi}$ is the strain-displacement matrix.\n\nSimilarly, the virtual strain $\\delta\\varepsilon$ is related to the virtual nodal displacements $\\delta d$ by the same matrix $B(\\xi)$:\n$$ \\delta\\varepsilon = B(\\xi)\\delta d $$\nThe constitutive law for linear elasticity is $\\sigma = E(\\xi)\\varepsilon$. Substituting the expression for $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\sigma = E(\\xi)B(\\xi)d $$\nNow we substitute these expressions for $\\sigma$, $\\delta\\varepsilon$, and the differential element $dx = J(\\xi)d\\xi$ into the virtual work integral. The integration limits change from $[x_1, x_2]$ to $[-1, 1]$. To maintain correct matrix multiplication form, we write $\\sigma \\delta\\varepsilon = \\delta\\varepsilon^T \\sigma$:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{int}} = \\int_{-1}^{1} (B(\\xi)\\delta d)^T (E(\\xi)B(\\xi)d) A(\\xi) J(\\xi) d\\xi $$\nUsing the property $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$, we get $(\\delta d^T B(\\xi)^T)$. Since nodal displacements $d$ and $\\delta d$ are not functions of $\\xi$, they can be taken outside the integral:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{int}} = \\delta d^T \\left( \\int_{-1}^{1} B(\\xi)^T E(\\xi) B(\\xi) A(\\xi) J(\\xi) d\\xi \\right) d $$\nThe internal virtual work is also defined as $\\delta W_{\\text{int}} = \\delta d^T K d$, where $K$ is the element stiffness matrix. By comparison, we obtain the expression for $K$:\n$$ K = \\int_{-1}^{1} B(\\xi)^T E(\\xi) A(\\xi) B(\\xi) J(\\xi) d\\xi $$\nNote that $E(\\xi)$, $A(\\xi)$, and $J(\\xi)$ are scalars for this $1$D problem and can be rearranged within the integrand. The standard form is:\n$$ K = \\int_{-1}^{1} B(\\xi)^T E(\\xi) A(\\xi) J(\\xi) B(\\xi) d\\xi $$\nThe problem asks for this expression along with explicit forms for $N(\\xi)$, $J(\\xi)$, and $B(\\xi)$.\n\nThe shape functions are given:\n$$ N(\\xi) = \\begin{bmatrix} N_1(\\xi)  N_2(\\xi) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1-\\xi}{2}  \\frac{1+\\xi}{2} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe isoparametric mapping for the coordinate is $x(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi)x_1 + N_2(\\xi)x_2$:\n$$ x(\\xi) = \\frac{1-\\xi}{2}x_1 + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}x_2 = \\frac{x_1+x_2}{2} + \\frac{x_2-x_1}{2}\\xi $$\nThe Jacobian $J(\\xi)$ is the derivative of $x(\\xi)$ with respect to $\\xi$:\n$$ J(\\xi) = \\frac{dx}{d\\xi} = \\frac{x_2-x_1}{2} $$\nFor a linear element, the Jacobian is constant. Let $L=x_2-x_1$ be the element length, so $J(\\xi)=L/2$.\nThe derivatives of the shape functions with respect to $\\xi$ are:\n$$ N_{,\\xi} = \\frac{dN}{d\\xi} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe strain-displacement matrix $B(\\xi)$ is then:\n$$ B(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{J(\\xi)}N_{,\\xi} = \\frac{1}{(x_2-x_1)/2} \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{2}{x_2-x_1} \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{x_2-x_1}\\begin{bmatrix} -1  1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nSince $J(\\xi)$ is constant for this element, $B(\\xi)$ is also constant.\n\n(b) Exact Integration using Gauss-Legendre Quadrature\n\nA Gauss-Legendre quadrature with $n_p$ integration points integrates a polynomial of degree up to $2n_p - 1$ exactly. The problem specifies a $2$-point quadrature, so $n_p=2$. Therefore, the integration of the stiffness matrix will be exact if the polynomial degree of the integrand is less than or equal to $2(2)-1=3$.\n\nThe stiffness matrix is $K = \\int_{-1}^{1} k(\\xi) d\\xi$, where the integrand is the matrix $k(\\xi) = B(\\xi)^T E(\\xi) A(\\xi) B(\\xi) J(\\xi)$. Since $E(\\xi)$, $A(\\xi)$, and $J(\\xi)$ are scalars, we can write $k(\\xi) = (B(\\xi)^T B(\\xi)) E(\\xi) A(\\xi) J(\\xi)$. We need to determine the polynomial degree of each component of this matrix integrand as a function of $\\xi$.\n\nLet's analyze the degree of each term:\n1.  Jacobian, $J(\\xi)$: As derived in part (a), $J(\\xi) = \\frac{x_2-x_1}{2}$ is a constant. Its polynomial degree is $0$.\n2.  Strain-Displacement Matrix, $B(\\xi)$: As derived in part (a), $B(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{x_2-x_1}\\begin{bmatrix} -1  1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is a constant row vector. Its components have a polynomial degree of $0$. Consequently, the matrix product $B(\\xi)^T B(\\xi)$ is also a constant matrix:\n    $$ B(\\xi)^T B(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{(x_2-x_1)^2} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -1  1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{(x_2-x_1)^2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n    The degree of each component is $0$.\n3.  Cross-sectional Area, $A(\\xi)$: The area varies linearly and is defined by the isoparametric interpolation $A(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi)A_1 + N_2(\\xi)A_2$:\n    $$ A(\\xi) = \\frac{1-\\xi}{2}A_1 + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}A_2 = \\left(\\frac{A_1+A_2}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{A_2-A_1}{2}\\right)\\xi $$\n    Assuming a tapered bar (i.e., $A_1 \\neq A_2$), $A(\\xi)$ is a polynomial of degree $1$ in $\\xi$.\n4.  Young's Modulus, $E(\\xi)$: It is given as an arbitrary polynomial of degree $m$ in $\\xi$.\n\nThe integrand for the stiffness matrix is $k(\\xi) = (B^T B) J E(\\xi) A(\\xi)$. Since $B^T B$ and $J$ are constant matrices/scalars, the polynomial nature of the integrand is determined entirely by the product $E(\\xi)A(\\xi)$. Let this product be $P(\\xi) = E(\\xi)A(\\xi)$.\nThe degree of a product of polynomials is the sum of their degrees.\n$$ \\text{degree}(P(\\xi)) = \\text{degree}(E(\\xi)) + \\text{degree}(A(\\xi)) = m + 1 $$\nFor exact integration using a $2$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature, the degree of the integrand polynomial must be at most $3$:\n$$ \\text{degree}(P(\\xi)) \\leq 3 $$\n$$ m + 1 \\leq 3 $$\nSolving for $m$, we find:\n$$ m \\leq 2 $$\nThe largest integer value for $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m_{\\max}=2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3498543"}, {"introduction": "Moving from one dimension to two, we now apply the finite element framework to a classic element: the three-node linear triangle.

The boundary integral term contributes to the element load vector, typically involving natural boundary conditions or inter-element flux continuity. The bilinear form associated with the problem on the element domain is:\n$$\na_e(u, v) = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\kappa (\\nabla v) \\cdot (\\nabla u) \\, d\\Omega_e\n$$\nThe FEM approximates the solution $u$ within the element $\\Omega_e$ by an interpolation of the nodal values $u_j$:\n$$\nu_h(x, y) = \\sum_{j \\in \\{a, b, c\\}} u_j N_j(x, y)\n$$\nwhere $N_j(x,y)$ are the linear shape functions for the three-node triangle (T3), and $u_j$ are the unknown values of the solution at the vertices $j \\in \\{a, b, c\\}$.

It is a valid problem from the field of computational solid mechanics. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of Constitutive Matrices\n\n#### Plane Strain ($D_{\\mathrm{pe}}$)\nThe plane strain condition is $\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\varepsilon_{xz} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = 0$. The 3D constitutive law in component form is $\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\varepsilon_{kk} + 2G \\varepsilon_{ij}$.\nThe trace of the strain tensor is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{kk} = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}$.\nThe in-plane stress components are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}) + 2G\\varepsilon_{xx} = (\\lambda + 2G)\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\lambda\\varepsilon_{yy} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}) + 2G\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_{xx} + (\\lambda + 2G)\\varepsilon_{yy} $$\nThe shear stress is $\\tau_{xy} = \\sigma_{xy} = 2G\\varepsilon_{xy} = G\\gamma_{xy}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda$ and $G$ in terms of $E$ and $\\nu$:\n$ \\lambda+2G = \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} + \\frac{E}{1+\\nu} = \\frac{E\\nu + E(1-2\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} = \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $\n$ \\lambda = \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $\n$ G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} \\frac{1-2\\nu}{2} $\nThe matrix $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ relates $[\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\tau_{xy}]^\\top$ to $[\\varepsilon_{xx}, \\varepsilon_{yy}, \\gamma_{xy}]^\\top$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda+2G  \\lambda  0 \\\\\n\\lambda  \\lambda+2G  0 \\\\\n0  0  G\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\frac{E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1-\\nu  \\nu  0 \\\\\n\\nu  1-\\nu  0 \\\\\n0  0  \\frac{1-2\\nu}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n#### Plane Stress ($D_{\\mathrm{ps}}$)\nThe plane stress condition is $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$. It is easier to start from the compliance form of Hooke's law: $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{ij} - \\nu(\\sigma_{kk}\\delta_{ij} - \\sigma_{ij})) = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{kk}\\delta_{ij}$.\nWith plane stress, $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}$.

For $E0$ and $\\nu \\in (-1,\\tfrac{1}{2})$, both $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ are symmetric, and consequently $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ is symmetric in both plane strain and plane stress.**\nBy inspection of the derived matrices, both $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ are symmetric. The stiffness matrix is given by $\\boldsymbol{K}_e = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\boldsymbol{B}^{\\top}\\,\\boldsymbol{D}\\,\\boldsymbol{B}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega$. Its transpose is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{K}_e^{\\top} = \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\boldsymbol{B}^{\\top}\\,\\boldsymbol{D}\\,\\boldsymbol{B}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega \\right)^{\\top} = \\int_{\\Omega_e} (\\boldsymbol{B}^{\\top}\\,\\boldsymbol{D}\\,\\boldsymbol{B})^{\\top}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\boldsymbol{B}^{\\top}\\,\\boldsymbol{D}^{\\top}\\,\\boldsymbol{B}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is symmetric ($\\boldsymbol{D}^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{D}$), it follows that $\\boldsymbol{K}_e^{\\top} = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\boldsymbol{B}^{\\top}\\,\\boldsymbol{D}\\,\\boldsymbol{B}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\boldsymbol{K}_e$. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ is symmetric. This holds for both plane strain and plane stress.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For any fixed $\\nu0$, the in-plane shear contribution to $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ is strictly larger under plane strain than under plane stress, for the same $\\Omega_e$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$.**\nThe in-plane shear behavior is governed by the $(3,3)$ entry of the constitutive matrix, which maps $\\gamma_{xy}$ to $\\tau_{xy}$.\nFor plane strain: $(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}})_{33} = G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$.\nFor plane stress: $(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}})_{33} = G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$.\nThe shear moduli are identical. Therefore, the shear contribution to the element stiffness matrix, which depends on this modulus, is also identical, not strictly larger.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. As $\\nu \\to \\tfrac{1}{2}^{-}$ with $E$ and $\\Omega_e$ fixed, the spectral condition number of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ in plane strain tends to $+\\infty$, whereas in plane stress it remains bounded.**\nThe spectral condition number of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ is related to that of $\\boldsymbol{D}$.\nFor plane strain, the prefactor of $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ is $\\frac{E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$, which tends to $+\\infty$ as $\\nu \\to \\tfrac{1}{2}^{-}$. One of the eigenvalues of the top-left $2 \\times 2$ block of $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ is $\\frac{E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$, which diverges. Other eigenvalues remain bounded (e.g., $G = E/(2(1+\\nu))$ approaches $E/3$). The ratio of the largest to smallest eigenvalue of $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ tends to infinity. This ill-conditioning is passed to $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$, a phenomenon known as volumetric locking.\nFor plane stress, as $\\nu \\to \\tfrac{1}{2}^{-}$, the matrix $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ approaches:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}} \\to \\frac{E}{1-(1/2)^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1/2  0 \\\\ 1/2  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\frac{1-1/2}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{4E}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1/2  0 \\\\ 1/2  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1/4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAll entries are finite and the matrix is well-conditioned. Its eigenvalues are finite and non-zero. Consequently, the condition number of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ for plane stress remains bounded.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For any fixed $\\nu0$ and fixed $\\Omega_e$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$, every entry of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ under plane strain is greater than or equal to the corresponding entry under plane stress.**\nThis statement requires that $\\boldsymbol{K}_e^{\\mathrm{pe}} - \\boldsymbol{K}_e^{\\mathrm{ps}}$ be a matrix with all non-negative entries. This difference is $\\int_{\\Omega_e} \\boldsymbol{B}^{\\top}\\,(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}} - \\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}})\\,\\boldsymbol{B}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega$.\nThe difference in constitutive matrices is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}} - \\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{E\\nu^2}{(1-\\nu^2)(1-2\\nu)} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor $\\nu \\in (0, 1/2)$, the prefactor is positive. The matrix of all ones is not positive definite. The product $\\boldsymbol{B}^{\\top}\\,(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}} - \\boldsymbol D_{\\mathrm{ps}})\\,\\boldsymbol{B}$ is not guaranteed to have all non-negative entries, because the entries of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ (which are derivatives of shape functions) can be positive or negative. For example, in a constant strain triangle, some off-diagonal blocks of the stiffness matrix will contain negative entries arising from this difference. Therefore, it is false that every entry of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e^{\\mathrm{pe}}$ is greater than or equal to the corresponding entry of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e^{\\mathrm{ps}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Switching between plane strain and plane stress changes the sparsity pattern of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ because $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ have different zero patterns.**\nThe sparsity pattern (the location of zero and non-zero entries) of $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ is identical for $\\nu \\in (-1, 1/2), \\nu \\ne 0$. Both are block-diagonal with a dense $2 \\times 2$ block and a $1 \\times 1$ block. The sparsity of the element stiffness matrix $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ is determined by the mesh connectivity (i.e., which nodes share an element), which dictates the non-zero blocks of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$, and the structure of $\\boldsymbol{B}$. Since the zero-entry structure of $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ is the same, the sparsity pattern of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ will not change.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. For any kinematically admissible displacement field $\\boldsymbol{v}$, and any $\\nu0$, one has the energy density inequality $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_e(\\boldsymbol{v})^{\\top}\\,\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_e(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\ge \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_e(\\boldsymbol{v})^{\\top}\\,\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_e(\\boldsymbol{v})$, with equality for pure in-plane shear $\\gamma_{xy} \\ne 0$ and $\\varepsilon_{xx}=\\varepsilon_{yy}=0$. Consequently, the shear part of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ is identical in plane strain and plane stress, while the normal part is stiffer in plane strain.**\nThe inequality is equivalent to $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_e^{\\top}\\,(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}} - \\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}})\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_e \\ge 0$. This requires the matrix $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{D} = \\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{pe}} - \\boldsymbol{D}_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ to be positive semi-definite. As shown in the analysis for D,\n$$ \\Delta\\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{E\\nu^2}{(1-\\nu^2)(1-2\\nu)} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor $\\nu \\in (0, 1/2)$, the prefactor is positive. The matrix $\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right)$ has eigenvalues $2$ and $0$, so it's positive semi-definite. Thus, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{D}$ is positive semi-definite, and the inequality holds.\nEquality holds when $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_e^{\\top}\\,\\Delta\\boldsymbol{D}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_e = 0$, which evaluates to $\\frac{E\\nu^2}{(1-\\nu^2)(1-2\\nu)}(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})^2=0$. This is true if and only if $\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy}=0$. The case of pure shear ($\\varepsilon_{xx}=\\varepsilon_{yy}=0$) is a valid instance where equality holds.\nThe consequence follows: the shear modulus $G$ is the same in both formulations, so the shear part of $\\boldsymbol{K}_e$ is identical. The \"normal part,\" associated with the top-left $2 \\times 2$ block of $\\boldsymbol{D}$, is where the difference lies. The positive semi-definiteness of $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{D}$ demonstrates that the plane strain formulation is energetically stiffer in its response to normal strains.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACF}$$", "id": "3383946"}]}
