The solution is structured in three parts as requested: derivation of the quadrature rule, application to the specific integral, and a justification of the result's exactness.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the $3$-point Gauss–Legendre Quadrature Rule**\n\nA general $n$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule approximates the integral of a function $g(t)$ over the reference interval $[-1, 1]$ as a weighted sum:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} g(t) \\, dt \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i g(t_i)\n$$\nThis rule is constructed to be exact for polynomials of degree up to $2n-1$. For a $3$-point rule ($n=3$), the degree of exactness is $2(3)-1 = 5$. The $n$ quadrature nodes, $t_i$, are the roots of the $n$-th degree Legendre polynomial, $P_n(t)$, and the $n$ weights, $w_i$, are chosen to satisfy the exactness property.\n\nFirst, we determine the Legendre polynomial of degree $3$, $P_3(t)$. The Legendre polynomials can be generated using the Bonnet recurrence relation:\n$$\n(k+1)P_{k+1}(t) = (2k+1)tP_k(t) - kP_{k-1}(t)\n$$\nwith the first two polynomials being $P_0(t) = 1$ and $P_1(t) = t$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$$\n(1+1)P_2(t) = (2(1)+1)tP_1(t) - 1 P_0(t) \\implies 2P_2(t) = 3t(t) - 1(1) = 3t^2 - 1\n$$\n$$\nP_2(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(3t^2 - 1)\n$$\nFor $k=2$:\n$$\n(2+1)P_3(t) = (2(2)+1)tP_2(t) - 2P_1(t) \\implies 3P_3(t) = 5t\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(3t^2 - 1)\\right) - 2t\n$$\n$$\n3P_3(t) = \\frac{15}{2}t^3 - \\frac{5}{2}t - 2t = \\frac{15}{2}t^3 - \\frac{9}{2}t = \\frac{3}{2}(5t^3 - 3t)\n$$\n$$\nP_3(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(5t^3 - 3t)\n$$\nThe quadrature nodes $t_1, t_2, t_3$ are the roots of $P_3(t)=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(5t^3 - 3t) = 0 \\implies t(5t^2 - 3) = 0\n$$\nThe roots are $t_2=0$ and $5t^2 - 3 = 0$, which gives $t^2 = \\frac{3}{5}$, so $t = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$.\nThus, the nodes are:\n$$\nt_1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}, \\quad t_2 = 0, \\quad t_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\n$$\nNext, we find the weights $w_1, w_2, w_3$ by requiring the quadrature formula to be exact for polynomials of degree up to $2$, namely $g(t)=1$, $g(t)=t$, and $g(t)=t^2$.\n\nFor $g(t)=1$:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} 1 \\, dt = 2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i (1) = w_1 + w_2 + w_3\n$$\nFor $g(t)=t$:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} t \\, dt = 0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i t_i = w_1\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right) + w_2(0) + w_3\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}(w_3 - w_1)\n$$\nThis implies $w_1 = w_3$.\n\nFor $g(t)=t^2$:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} t^2 \\, dt = \\left[\\frac{t^3}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{2}{3} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i t_i^2 = w_1\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right)^2 + w_2(0)^2 + w_3\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} = w_1\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + w_3\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3}{5}(w_1 + w_3)\n$$\nUsing $w_1=w_3$, we have $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{5}(2w_1)$, which gives $w_1 = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{10}{18} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\nSo, $w_1 = w_3 = \\frac{5}{9}$.\nSubstituting these into the first equation, $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 2$:\n$$\n\\frac{5}{9} + w_2 + \\frac{5}{9} = 2 \\implies w_2 = 2 - \\frac{10}{9} = \\frac{18-10}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}\n$$\nThe $3$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule on $[-1,1]$ is defined by:\nNodes: $t_1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}, t_2 = 0, t_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$\nWeights: $w_1 = \\frac{5}{9}, w_2 = \\frac{8}{9}, w_3 = \\frac{5}{9}$\n\n**Part 2: Application to the Integral $\\int_{0}^{2} x^{5} \\, dx$**\n\nTo apply the quadrature rule, we must map the interval of integration $[0,2]$ to the reference interval $[-1,1]$. We use the affine transformation $x(t) = at+b$.\nThe conditions are $x(-1)=0$ and $x(1)=2$:\n$$\n-a+b=0 \\implies b=a\n$$\n$$\na+b=2 \\implies a+a=2 \\implies 2a=2 \\implies a=1\n$$\nSo, $a=1$ and $b=1$, and the mapping is $x(t) = t+1$. The differential element is $dx = dt$.\nWe transform the integral:\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{2} x^{5} \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} (t+1)^{5} \\, dt\n$$\nLet $g(t) = (t+1)^5$. We now apply the derived $3$-point rule:\n$$\nI \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i g(t_i) = w_1 g(t_1) + w_2 g(t_2) + w_3 g(t_3)\n$$\n$$\nI \\approx \\frac{5}{9}g\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right) + \\frac{8}{9}g(0) + \\frac{5}{9}g\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nI \\approx \\frac{5}{9}\\left(1-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right)^5 + \\frac{8}{9}(1+0)^5 + \\frac{5}{9}\\left(1+\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\right)^5\n$$\nLet $A = \\sqrt{3/5}$. The expression is $\\frac{5}{9}\\left[ (1-A)^5 + (1+A)^5 \\right] + \\frac{8}{9}$.\nUsing the binomial expansion, $(1\\pm A)^5 = 1 \\pm 5A + 10A^2 \\pm 10A^3 + 5A^4 \\pm A^5$.\nThe sum is $(1-A)^5 + (1+A)^5 = 2(1 + 10A^2 + 5A^4)$.\nWe have $A^2 = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $A^4 = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n2\\left(1 + 10\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + 5\\left(\\frac{9}{25}\\right)\\right) = 2\\left(1 + 6 + \\frac{9}{5}\\right) = 2\\left(7 + \\frac{9}{5}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{35+9}{5}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{44}{5}\\right) = \\frac{88}{5}\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $I$:\n$$\nI \\approx \\frac{5}{9} \\left( \\frac{88}{5} \\right) + \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{88}{9} + \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{96}{9} = \\frac{32}{3}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Justification of Exactness and Verification**\n\nFirst, a theoretical justification is provided. The degree of exactness of an $n$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule is $2n-1$. For our $n=3$ point rule, the degree of exactness is $2(3)-1=5$. This means the quadrature rule integrates any polynomial of degree up to $5$ on the interval $[-1,1]$ exactly. The integrand after transformation is $g(t) = (t+1)^5$, which is a polynomial of degree $5$. Since the degree of the integrand ($5$) is less than or equal to the degree of exactness ($5$), the value computed by the quadrature rule is not an approximation but is the exact value of the integral $\\int_{-1}^1 (t+1)^5 \\, dt$.\n\nSecond, to corroborate this, we perform an explicit algebraic verification by computing the original integral directly:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2} x^{5} \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^6}{6} \\right]_{0}^{2} = \\frac{2^6}{6} - \\frac{0^6}{6} = \\frac{64}{6} = \\frac{32}{3}\n$$\nThe value obtained from the direct analytical integration is $\\frac{32}{3}$, which is identical to the value obtained from the $3$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule. This confirms both the theoretical prediction of exactness and the correctness of the derived nodes and weights and their application.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{32}{3}}\n$$", "id": "3398412"}, {"introduction": "While manual derivation is insightful, practical applications require a systematic and robust method for generating quadrature rules.

The standard Legendre polynomials, denoted $P_k(x)$, are orthogonal but not orthonormal.

The function $(p_k(x))^2 w(x) = (p_k(x))^2$ is always an even function on $[-1, 1]$ because $p_k(x)$ has definite parity ($p_k(-x) = (-1)^k p_k(x)$).

The three-term recurrence relations for $k=0, \\dots, n-2$ can be expressed in matrix form as:\n$$x \\vec{p}(x) = J_n \\vec{p}(x) + \\beta_n p_n(x) \\vec{e}_{n-1}$$\nwhere $\\vec{e}_{n-1} = [0, \\dots, 0, 1]^T$.\nThe $n$ nodes $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ of an $n$-point Gaussian quadrature rule are precisely the roots of the $n$-th degree orthogonal polynomial, $p_n(x)$. If we evaluate the matrix equation at a root $x_i$ of $p_n(x)$, the term $p_n(x_i)$ vanishes:\n$$x_i \\vec{p}(x_i) = J_n \\vec{p}(x_i)$$\nThis is the standard eigenvalue equation $A\\vec{v} = \\lambda\\vec{v}$. It shows that the roots $x_i$ of $p_n(x)$ are the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix $J_n$, and the corresponding eigenvectors are proportional to the vector of polynomials evaluated at those roots, $\\vec{p}(x_i)$.\n\nThe quadrature weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ can be recovered from the normalized eigenvectors of $J_n$. Let $J_n = V \\Lambda V^T$ be the spectral decomposition of $J_n$, where $\\Lambda = \\mathrm{diag}(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ and $V$ is the orthogonal matrix whose columns $\\vec{v}_i$ are the normalized eigenvectors. The eigenvector $\\vec{v}_i$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $x_i$ is a normalized version of $\\vec{p}(x_i)$.\nThe quadrature weights are given by the formula $w_i = \\mu_0 (v_{i,0})^2$, where $v_{i,0}$ is the first component of the normalized eigenvector $\\vec{v}_i$ corresponding to the node $x_i$, and $\\mu_0 = \\int_a^b w(x)\\,dx$ is the zeroth moment of the weight function. For our problem, $\\mu_0 = \\int_{-1}^1 1\\,dx = 2$.\n\n**Computation for n=3:**\nWe compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $J_3$. The eigenvalues will be the nodes $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^3$. The weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^3$ are computed as $w_i = 2 (v_{i,0})^2$, where $v_{i,0}$ is the first component of the normalized eigenvector corresponding to $x_i$.\n\n### Part 3: Tensor-Product Quadrature for Multiple Dimensions\n\nTo approximate a two-dimensional integral over a rectangular domain $\\iint_{[-1,1]^2} f(x,y)\\,dx\\,dy$, we can apply the one-dimensional quadrature rule iteratively. By Fubini's theorem, the integral can be written as:\n$$\\int_{-1}^1 \\left( \\int_{-1}^1 f(x,y)\\,dy \\right) dx$$\nWe can approximate the inner integral using the $n$-point Gauss-Legendre rule $\\{x_j, w_j\\}_{j=1}^n$:\n$$\\int_{-1}^1 f(x,y)\\,dy \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j f(x, y_j)$$\nSubstituting this back into the outer integral:\n$$\\int_{-1}^1 \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j f(x, y_j) \\right) dx = \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \\int_{-1}^1 f(x, y_j) dx$$\nApplying the same quadrature rule (with nodes $\\{x_i, w_i\\}_{i=1}^n$) to the remaining integral gives the tensor-product rule:\n$$\\iint_{[-1,1]^2} f(x,y)\\,dx\\,dy \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i, y_j) \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j f(x_i, y_j)$$\nThis formula uses a grid of $n^2$ points $(x_i, y_j)$ with corresponding weights $w_i w_j$. This method is particularly efficient for separable functions $f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)$, as the integral and its approximation become products:\n$$\\iint_{[-1,1]^2} g(x)h(y)\\,dx\\,dy = \\left( \\int_{-1}^1 g(x)\\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-1}^1 h(y)\\,dy \\right) \\approx \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i g(x_i) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j h(y_j) \\right)$$\nThe tests will involve both a separable polynomial and a non-polynomial smooth function, for which the tensor-product rule is applied using the computed $3$-point Gauss-Legendre nodes and weights.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and applies the 3-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule\n    using the Golub-Welsch algorithm (eigenvalue problem of the Jacobi matrix).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Part 1  2: Derive Jacobi Matrix, compute Nodes and Weights ---\n    n = 3\n    \n    # The Jacobi matrix for orthonormal Legendre polynomials has alpha_k = 0.\n    # The off-diagonal entries are beta_k = k / sqrt(4k^2 - 1).\n    beta = [k / np.sqrt(4 * k**2 - 1) for k in range(1, n)]\n    \n    # Construct the symmetric tridiagonal Jacobi matrix J\n    J = np.diag(beta, k=1) + np.diag(beta, k=-1)\n    \n    # The nodes are the eigenvalues of J.\n    # The weights are derived from the first component of the eigenvectors.\n    # np.linalg.eigh is used for symmetric matrices; it returns sorted eigenvalues\n    # and corresponding eigenvectors as columns.\n    nodes, V = np.linalg.eigh(J)\n    \n    # The zeroth moment (total mass) is mu0 = integral from -1 to 1 of w(x)=1 dx.\n    mu0 = 2.0\n    \n    # Weights w_i = mu_0 * (v_{i,0})^2, where v_{i,0} is the first component of\n    # the i-th normalized eigenvector.

The solution proceeds in two stages: first, the determination of the rule's parameters, and second, the evaluation of the error based on the rule's properties.\n\nThe reference triangle is given by $\\mathcal{T} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0, x+y \\le 1\\}$.

This is equivalent to requiring the rule to be exact for all monomials $x^i y^j$ where $i,j \\ge 0$ and $i+j \\le 3$.\n\nFirst, we establish the exact value of the integrals of these monomials. Using the hint of the Beta function, we derive the general formula for $I_{ij} = \\int_{\\mathcal{T}} x^i y^j \\,dx\\,dy$:\n$$ I_{ij} = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^{1-y} x^i y^j \\,dx\\,dy = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left[ \\frac{x^{i+1}}{i+1} \\right]_0^{1-y} \\,dy = \\frac{1}{i+1} \\int_0^1 y^j (1-y)^{i+1} \\,dy $$\nThe integral is the Beta function $B(j+1, i+2)$.

As established, $a \\ne \\frac{1}{3}$, so the only valid solution is $a = \\frac{1}{5}$. This value lies in the required range $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\n\nWith $a = \\frac{1}{5}$, we find the weights. From (5):\n$w_a(3(\\frac{1}{5})-1)^2 = \\frac{1}{24} \\implies w_a(-\\frac{2}{5})^2 = \\frac{1}{24} \\implies w_a(\\frac{4}{25}) = \\frac{1}{24} \\implies w_a = \\frac{25}{96}$.\nFrom (1):\n$w_c = \\frac{1}{2} - 3w_a = \\frac{1}{2} - 3(\\frac{25}{96}) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{75}{96} = \\frac{48-75}{96} = -\\frac{27}{96} = -\\frac{9}{32}$.\n\nThe parameters are therefore $a = \\frac{1}{5}$, $w_a = \\frac{25}{96}$, and $w_c = -\\frac{9}{32}$.
