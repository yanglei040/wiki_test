We must first verify that this function belongs to $H^{1}(\\Omega)$.\n1.  The function $u(x)=c$ is in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ because $\\Omega$ is a bounded domain, so its volume (Lebesgue measure) $|\\Omega|$ is finite. The $L^{2}$-norm squared is $\\|c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{\\Omega} c^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} = c^2 |\\Omega| < \\infty$.\n2.  The gradient of a constant function is the zero vector, $\\nabla u = \\nabla c = 0$. The zero vector field is square-integrable over $\\Omega$, i.e., $\\|\\nabla c\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{\\Omega} |0|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} = 0 < \\infty$.\nSince both $u$ and its weak derivative $\\nabla u$ are in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$, the function $u(x) = c$ is in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$. As $c \\neq 0$, it is a non-zero element of the space.\n\nNow, we evaluate both sides of the coercivity inequality for $u(x) = c$.\nThe left-hand side is the value of the bilinear form:\n$$\na(u,u) = a(c,c) = \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla c|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} = \\int_{\\Omega} |0|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} = 0\n$$\nThe right-hand side involves the $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ norm squared:\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\|c\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{\\Omega} c^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} + \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla c|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} = c^2 |\\Omega| + 0 = c^2 |\\Omega|\n$$\nSince $\\Omega$ is a domain in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \\ge 1$), its measure $|\\Omega|$ is strictly positive. As $c \\neq 0$, the norm is strictly positive: $\\|u\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2} = c^2 |\\Omega| > 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the coercivity inequality gives:\n$$\n0 \\geq \\alpha (c^2 |\\Omega|)\n$$\nFor any choice of $\\alpha > 0$, the right-hand side is a strictly positive number ($\\alpha > 0$, $c^2 > 0$, $|\\Omega| > 0$). The inequality $0 \\geq (\\text{positive number})$ is false.\nTherefore, for any non-zero constant function, such as $u(x) = 1$, the coercivity condition fails for any $\\alpha > 0$. This demonstrates that the bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is not coercive on $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ when $\\Gamma_{D}$ has zero measure (or is empty). The kernel of the seminorm induced by $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is non-trivial and contains the space of constant functions.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Extremal Constant $\\alpha^{\\ast}$**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of the constant:\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\ast} := \\inf_{u \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{a(u,u)}{\\|u\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2}}\n$$\nLet's analyze the expression to be minimized, which is a Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\n\\frac{a(u,u)}{\\|u\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2}} = \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x}}{\\int_{\\Omega} u^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} + \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x}}\n$$\nThe numerator, $\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x}$, is non-negative for any $u \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$. The denominator, $\\|u\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2}$, is strictly positive for any $u \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}$. Consequently, the quotient is always greater than or equal to $0$. This implies that the infimum must satisfy $\\alpha^{\\ast} \\geq 0$.\n\nFrom the first part of our analysis, we have already found a function for which we can evaluate this quotient. Let's use the non-zero function $u(x) = 1$, which is in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$.\nFor $u(x) = 1$:\n- $a(1,1) = \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla 1|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} = 0$.\n- $\\|1\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{\\Omega} 1^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} + \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla 1|^2 \\,d\\boldsymbol{x} = |\\Omega| + 0 = |\\Omega| > 0$.\n\nThe value of the quotient for this function is:\n$$\n\\frac{a(1,1)}{\\|1\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2}} = \\frac{0}{|\\Omega|} = 0\n$$\nWe have shown that:\n1.  The value of the quotient is always non-negative, so $0$ is a lower bound for the set of values.\n2.  We have found a specific function $u(x)=1$ for which the quotient is exactly $0$.\n\nThe infimum of a set is the greatest lower bound. Since $0$ is a lower bound and it is also attained by an element in the set, it must be the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the extremal constant is $\\alpha^{\\ast} = 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3460613"}, {"introduction": "The stability of a weak form can be compromised not only by boundary conditions but also by the coefficients within the partial differential equation itself.

Substituting this expression for $w$ into equation (1) eliminates the auxiliary variable:\n$$ \\partial_{\\boldsymbol{n}} u + \\alpha\\,u - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\beta}u\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\partial_{\\boldsymbol{n}} u + \\alpha\\,u + \\frac{1}{\\beta}u = 0 $$\n$$ \\partial_{\\boldsymbol{n}} u = -\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right)u $$\nThis shows that the coupled two-equation system is equivalent to a standard Robin boundary condition with a Robin coefficient of $\\alpha + \\beta^{-1}$. We can now substitute this expression for $\\partial_{\\boldsymbol{n}} u$ into the boundary integral of our weak form:\n$$ -\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} (\\partial_{\\boldsymbol{n}} u)v\\,ds = -\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\left[-\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right)u\\right]v\\,ds = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right)uv\\,ds $$\nSubstituting this result back, we arrive at the final weak formulation: Find $u \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$ such that for all $v \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$,\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v\\,d\\boldsymbol{x} + c\\int_{\\Omega} uv\\,d\\boldsymbol{x} + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\left(\\alpha + \\beta^{-1}\\right)uv\\,ds = \\int_{\\Omega} fv\\,d\\boldsymbol{x} $$\nThis formulation is of the form $a(u,v) = L(v)$, where the bilinear form $a(u,v)$ is\n$$ a(u,v) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v\\,d\\boldsymbol{x} + c\\int_{\\Omega} uv\\,d\\boldsymbol{x} + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\left(\\alpha + \\beta^{-1}\\right)uv\\,ds $$\nand the linear functional $L(v)$ is $L(v) = \\int_{\\Omega} fv\\,d\\boldsymbol{x}$. The derivation confirms that the Robin system contributes the boundary bilinear form $\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} (\\alpha + \\beta^{-1})\\,u\\,v\\, ds$, as stated in the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Coercivity Conditions and Choice of Norm**\n\nSpecializing to the one-dimensional case $\\Omega=(0,1)$, the bilinear form is\n$$ a(u,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)\\,v'(x)\\,dx + c \\int_{0}^{1} u(x)\\,v(x)\\,dx + \\big(\\alpha + \\beta^{-1}\\big)\\,\\Big(u(0)\\,v(0) + u(1)\\,v(1)\\Big) $$\nCoercivity of $a(u,v)$ on a Hilbert space $V$ requires the existence of a constant $\\gamma > 0$ such that $a(u,u) \\ge \\gamma \\|u\\|_{V}^{2}$ for all $u \\in V$. Here, $V = H^1(0,1)$.\n\nStructural conditions for coercivity:\nThe quadratic form associated with $a(u,v)$ is $a(u,u) = \\int_0^1 |u'|^2 dx + c \\int_0^1 |u|^2 dx + (\\alpha + \\beta^{-1})(|u(0)|^2+|u(1)|^2)$. The standard $H^1(0,1)$ norm is $\\|u\\|_{H^1}^2 = \\int_0^1 |u'|^2 dx + \\int_0^1 |u|^2 dx$.\nThe parameters are given as $c>0$, $\\alpha \\ge 0$, and $\\beta>0$. This implies $\\alpha+\\beta^{-1} > 0$.\nThe term $\\int_0^1 |u'|^2 dx$ is non-negative.\nThe term $c \\int_0^1 |u|^2 dx$ is non-negative since $c>0$.\nThe term $(\\alpha + \\beta^{-1})(|u(0)|^2+|u(1)|^2)$ is non-negative.\nTherefore, $a(u,u) \\ge \\int_0^1 |u'|^2 dx + c \\int_0^1 |u|^2 dx \\ge \\min(1,c) \\left( \\int_0^1 |u'|^2 dx + \\int_0^1 |u|^2 dx \\right) = \\min(1,c) \\|u\\|_{H^1}^2$.\nSince $c>0$, $\\min(1,c)$ is also positive, which establishes that $a(u,v)$ is coercive on $H^1(0,1)$ with respect to the standard $H^1$ norm. The conditions $c>0$, $\\alpha \\ge 0$, $\\beta > 0$ are sufficient.\n\nAppropriateness of the V-norm:\nThe problem defines the norm $\\|u\\|_{V}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} |u'(x)|^{2}\\,dx + \\int_{0}^{1} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx + \\tau\\,\\Big(|u(0)|^{2} + |u(1)|^{2}\\Big)$. For any $\\tau>0$, this norm is equivalent to the standard $H^1(0,1)$ norm. The choice of this norm is particularly appropriate because its structure mirrors the structure of the quadratic form $a(u,u)$. Both $a(u,u)$ and $\\|u\\|_V^2$ are composed of the same three fundamental components: the $L^2$ norm of the derivative, the $L^2$ norm of the function, and the sum of squared boundary values. This structural alignment simplifies the coercivity analysis, allowing for a direct, term-by-term comparison of coefficients to determine a coercivity constant, rather than relying on less precise estimates from trace inequalities.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of a Coercivity Constant**\n\nWe are tasked with finding a constant $\\gamma>0$ such that $a(u,u) \\ge \\gamma \\|u\\|_{V}^{2}$ for all $u \\in H^1(0,1)$. The given parameter values are $c = \\frac{3}{5}$, $\\alpha = 2$, $\\beta = 4$, and $\\tau = 5$.\n\nFirst, we compute the coefficient in the boundary term of $a(u,u)$:\n$$ \\alpha + \\beta^{-1} = 2 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{9}{4} $$\nThe quadratic form $a(u,u)$ and the squared norm $\\|u\\|_{V}^2$ are:\n$$ a(u,u) = \\int_{0}^{1} |u'(x)|^{2}\\,dx + \\frac{3}{5} \\int_{0}^{1} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx + \\frac{9}{4}\\Big(|u(0)|^{2} + |u(1)|^{2}\\Big) $$\n$$ \\|u\\|_{V}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} |u'(x)|^{2}\\,dx + \\int_{0}^{1} |u(x)|^{2}\\,dx + 5\\,\\Big(|u(0)|^{2} + |u(1)|^{2}\\Big) $$\nTo simplify notation, let $I_1 = \\int_0^1 |u'|^2 dx$, $I_2 = \\int_0^1 |u|^2 dx$, and $B = |u(0)|^2 + |u(1)|^2$.\nThe coercivity inequality $a(u,u) \\ge \\gamma \\|u\\|_{V}^{2}$ can be written as:\n$$ I_1 + \\frac{3}{5} I_2 + \\frac{9}{4} B \\ge \\gamma (I_1 + I_2 + 5B) $$\nRearranging the terms to one side, we get:\n$$ (1-\\gamma)I_1 + \\left(\\frac{3}{5}-\\gamma\\right)I_2 + \\left(\\frac{9}{4}-5\\gamma\\right)B \\ge 0 $$\nFor any $u \\in H^1(0,1)$, the quantities $I_1$, $I_2$, and $B$ are all non-negative. A sufficient condition for this inequality to hold for all $u$ is that all three coefficients are non-negative. This provides a direct method for finding a valid coercivity constant $\\gamma$.\n1.  $1 - \\gamma \\ge 0 \\implies \\gamma \\le 1$\n2.  $\\frac{3}{5} - \\gamma \\ge 0 \\implies \\gamma \\le \\frac{3}{5}$\n3.  $\\frac{9}{4} - 5\\gamma \\ge 0 \\implies 5\\gamma \\le \\frac{9}{4} \\implies \\gamma \\le \\frac{9}{20}$\n\nTo satisfy all three conditions simultaneously, $\\gamma$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of these upper bounds:\n$$ \\gamma \\le \\min\\left(1, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{9}{20}\\right) $$\nNumerically, these bounds are $\\min(1, 0.6, 0.45)$. The minimum is $\\frac{9}{20}$.\nWe can therefore choose $\\gamma = \\frac{9}{20}$. Let's verify this choice. With $\\gamma = \\frac{9}{20}$, the inequality becomes:\n$$ \\left(1-\\frac{9}{20}\\right)I_1 + \\left(\\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{9}{20}\\right)I_2 + \\left(\\frac{9}{4}-5\\left(\\frac{9}{20}\\right)\\right)B \\ge 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{11}{20}\\right)I_1 + \\left(\\frac{12}{20}-\\frac{9}{20}\\right)I_2 + \\left(\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)B \\ge 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{11}{20}I_1 + \\frac{3}{20}I_2 \\ge 0 $$\nSince $I_1 = \\int_0^1 |u'|^2 dx \\ge 0$ and $I_2 = \\int_0^1 |u|^2 dx \\ge 0$, this inequality is true for all $u \\in H^1(0,1)$. Thus, $\\gamma = \\frac{9}{20}$ is a valid coercivity constant. The problem asks for \"an\" explicit constant, not necessarily the optimal (largest) one, so this rigorously derived value is a correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{9}{20}}$$", "id": "3460619"}]}
