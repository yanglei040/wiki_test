This practice focuses on the foundational theory of shock waves for the inviscid Burgers' equation, a canonical model for hyperbolic conservation laws. By deriving the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition and applying the Lax entropy condition, you will determine the properties of a physically correct shock wave and contrast the \"shock-fitting\" approach of explicitly tracking this discontinuity with the \"shock-capturing\" methods we explore next [@problem_id:3442590].", "problem": "Consider the scalar conservation law (the inviscid Burgers equation) given by $u_{t} + (f(u))_{x} = 0$ with flux $f(u) = \\frac{u^{2}}{2}$. Let the initial data be the Riemann step $u(x,0) = u_{L}$ for $x < 0$ and $u(x,0) = u_{R}$ for $x > 0$ with the constant states $u_{L} = 2$ and $u_{R} = 0$. Starting from the conservation law in its integral form over a moving control volume that encloses a single propagating discontinuity, derive the jump relation for the physically admissible shock speed $s$ for a piecewise constant weak solution of this Riemann problem. Then evaluate $s$ for the given states, check the Lax entropy condition for convex fluxes in the form $f'(u_{L}) > s > f'(u_{R})$ (equivalently $u_{L} > u_{R}$ for Burgers), and write the corresponding piecewise weak solution $u(x,t)$ for $t > 0$ with a single shock located at $x = x_{s}(t)$. Explicitly state the shock trajectory $x_{s}(t)$, and verify that your solution satisfies the conservation law in the sense of distributions and the entropy inequality associated with a convex entropy–entropy flux pair. Finally, briefly explain how this shock speed would be used in a shock fitting strategy that tracks the interface $x_{s}(t)$, and contrast this with how a shock capturing scheme would approximate the same solution.\n\nProvide your final numerical answer for the shock speed $s$; no rounding is required and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The inviscid Burgers equation is the scalar conservation law $u_{t} + (f(u))_{x} = 0$ with $f(u) = \\frac{u^{2}}{2}$. Given the Riemann data $u(x,0) = u_{L}$ for $x < 0$ and $u(x,0) = u_{R}$ for $x > 0$, we seek a weak solution with a single discontinuity moving at speed $s$, located at $x = x_{s}(t)$, separating constant states $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$.\n\nThe fundamental base for deriving the shock speed is the integral form of conservation. For a smooth test function $\\varphi(x,t)$ with compact support, the weak formulation reads\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( u \\, \\varphi_{t} + f(u) \\, \\varphi_{x} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x,0) \\, \\varphi(x,0) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0.\n$$\nAlternatively, consider a small control volume that moves with the shock, enclosing the discontinuity at $x = x_{s}(t)$ with left and right states $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$. Applying conservation over this moving interface yields the Rankine–Hugoniot (RH) jump condition\n$$\ns \\, [u] = [f(u)],\n$$\nwhere $[u] = u_{R} - u_{L}$ and $[f(u)] = f(u_{R}) - f(u_{L})$. This follows by integrating the conservation law over an interval $(x_{s}(t) - \\epsilon, x_{s}(t) + \\epsilon)$ and letting $\\epsilon \\to 0$, or directly from the weak formulation with a Heaviside-type ansatz for $u(x,t)$.\n\nSolving the RH condition for $s$ gives\n$$\ns = \\frac{f(u_{R}) - f(u_{L})}{u_{R} - u_{L}}.\n$$\nFor Burgers, $f(u) = \\frac{u^{2}}{2}$, so\n$$\nf(u_{L}) = \\frac{(2)^{2}}{2} = 2, \\quad f(u_{R}) = \\frac{(0)^{2}}{2} = 0.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\ns = \\frac{0 - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1.\n$$\n\nNext, check the Lax entropy condition for a convex flux. For a scalar conservation law with a convex $f$, the Lax condition for a shock joining $u_{L}$ to $u_{R}$ is\n$$\nf'(u_{L}) > s > f'(u_{R}).\n$$\nFor Burgers, $f'(u) = u$, hence\n$$\nf'(u_{L}) = 2, \\quad f'(u_{R}) = 0, \\quad s = 1,\n$$\nand thus\n$$\n2 > 1 > 0,\n$$\nwhich holds. Equivalently, for Burgers the admissibility reduces to $u_{L} > u_{R}$ for a shock, which is satisfied since $2 > 0$. This guarantees characteristics impinge upon the shock from both sides, ensuring entropy admissibility.\n\nThe corresponding piecewise weak solution for $t > 0$ is a single shock located at\n$$\nx_{s}(t) = s \\, t = t,\n$$\nwith constant states\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\begin{cases}\n2, & x < x_{s}(t), \\\\\n0, & x > x_{s}(t).\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAt the interface $x = x_{s}(t)$, $u$ is discontinuous; one may define its trace values from the left and right as $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$. To verify that this is a weak solution, substitute this piecewise constant form into the weak formulation. Away from the shock, $u$ is constant, so $u_{t} = 0$ and $f(u)_{x} = 0$ hold pointwise. The contribution at the shock reduces to the jump measure concentrated on the interface. The weak balance reduces to the RH condition already derived, which is satisfied by $s = 1$, confirming that the distributional divergence vanishes.\n\nTo check entropy consistency with a convex entropy–entropy flux pair, consider the standard entropy $\\eta(u) = \\frac{1}{2} u^{2}$ and entropy flux $q(u) = \\int \\eta'(u) f'(u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u = \\int u \\cdot u \\, \\mathrm{d}u = \\frac{1}{3} u^{3}$. For a shock moving at speed $s$, the entropy inequality requires\n$$\ns \\, [\\eta(u)] \\geq [q(u)],\n$$\nwhere $[\\eta(u)] = \\eta(u_{R}) - \\eta(u_{L})$ and $[q(u)] = q(u_{R}) - q(u_{L})$. Compute\n$$\n\\eta(u_{L}) = \\frac{1}{2} (2)^{2} = 2, \\quad \\eta(u_{R}) = \\frac{1}{2} (0)^{2} = 0, \\quad [\\eta(u)] = 0 - 2 = -2,\n$$\nand\n$$\nq(u_{L}) = \\frac{1}{3} (2)^{3} = \\frac{8}{3}, \\quad q(u_{R}) = \\frac{1}{3} (0)^{3} = 0, \\quad [q(u)] = 0 - \\frac{8}{3} = -\\frac{8}{3}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\ns \\, [\\eta(u)] = 1 \\cdot (-2) = -2, \\quad [q(u)] = -\\frac{8}{3},\n$$\nand the inequality to check is $-2 \\geq -8/3$. This is true, since $-6/3 \\geq -8/3$. Thus the entropy inequality is satisfied.\n\nRegarding numerical strategies, a shock fitting scheme would explicitly track the interface $x_{s}(t)$ as a moving boundary in the computational mesh. The shock speed $s = 1$ determines the ordinary differential equation for the shock trajectory,\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_{s}}{\\mathrm{d} t} = s = 1,\n$$\nwith $x_{s}(0) = 0$, yielding $x_{s}(t) = t$. The mesh or interface conditions are updated accordingly to maintain the correct jump conditions across the shock. In contrast, a shock capturing scheme (such as a finite volume method with monotone numerical fluxes or Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) limiters, or an artificial viscosity method) does not explicitly track the interface; instead, it relies on discretization mechanisms to stabilize and approximate the discontinuity, smearing the shock over a few grid cells while maintaining the correct RH speed and entropy admissibility in the discrete sense.\n\nTherefore, the required shock speed is $s = 1$, the Lax entropy condition is satisfied, and the piecewise weak solution is the left state $u = 2$ for $x < t$ and the right state $u = 0$ for $x > t$, with a shock located at $x_{s}(t) = t$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3442590"}, {"introduction": "While first-order shock-capturing methods are robust, they often produce overly diffuse results.

In a shock-capturing finite volume method with Godunov-type numerical fluxes, second-order spatial accuracy is obtained by a piecewise linear reconstruction within each cell. To prevent spurious oscillations near discontinuities and sharp gradients, the linear slope is limited by a monotone limiter consistent with the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) principle. Assume that the limited slope in cell $i$ is obtained by applying the minmod limiter to the one-sided differences in that cell, and that the reconstructed interface states used by the numerical flux are the values of the linear reconstruction in cell $i$ evaluated at the left and right interfaces $x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}$ and $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$.

This slope must be limited to prevent spurious oscillations near discontinuities, ensuring the scheme is Total Variation Diminishing (TVD). The problem specifies the use of the `minmod` limiter.\n\nFirst, we define the potential slopes based on the one-sided differences of the cell-average values. The backward difference, representing the slope from cell $i-1$ to cell $i$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta u_i^{-} = u_i - u_{i-1}\n$$\nThe forward difference, representing the slope from cell $i$ to cell $i+1$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta u_i^{+} = u_{i+1} - u_i\n$$\nThe problem states that the mesh spacing is uniform with $\\Delta x = 1$. Per convention, the slopes are often normalized by $\\Delta x$, but since $\\Delta x = 1$, the differences in cell averages are numerically equal to the slopes.\n\nUsing the given data, $u_{i-1} = 0$, $u_i = 1$, and $u_{i+1} = 3$, we compute these differences:\n$$\n\\Delta u_i^{-} = 1 - 0 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta u_i^{+} = 3 - 1 = 2\n$$\nThe `minmod` limiter is applied to these two values to determine the limited slope $s_i$. The `minmod` function is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{minmod}(a, b) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    \\min(a, b) & \\text{if } a > 0, b > 0 \\\\\n    \\max(a, b) & \\text{if } a < 0, b < 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\text{if } ab \\le 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function selects the slope with the smallest magnitude if both slopes have the same sign, and returns $0$ if they have opposite signs. This prevents the reconstruction from creating new local extrema.\n\nApplying the `minmod` function to our calculated differences:\n$$\ns_i = \\text{minmod}(\\Delta u_i^{-}, \\Delta u_i^{+}) = \\text{minmod}(1, 2)\n$$\nSince both arguments are positive, we take the minimum of the two values:\n$$\ns_i = \\min(1, 2) = 1\n$$\nThus, the limited slope in cell $i$ is $s_i = 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the reconstructed values at the cell interfaces.

The velocities are anti-symmetric: $u'_{L}=u_{R}=-u_{L}=-u'_{R}$.\nThe entire problem setup is identical to the first one, just spatially reflected. The same logic applies, leading to sound speeds $a'_{L}=a'_{R}=a$, wave speed estimates $S'_{L} = S_L$ and $S'_{R}=S_R$, and a contact speed $S'_* = 0$.\nTherefore, the mass flux at this interface is also zero:\n$$\nF_{-1/2}^{(1),n} = 0\n$$\n\n**6.
