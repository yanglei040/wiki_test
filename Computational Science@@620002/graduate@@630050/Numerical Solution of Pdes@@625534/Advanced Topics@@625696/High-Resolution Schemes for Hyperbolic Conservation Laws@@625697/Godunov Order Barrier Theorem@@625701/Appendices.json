It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of numerical analysis for partial differential equations. The definitions and schemes are standard, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the constant-coefficient linear advection equation $u_t + a u_x = 0$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We discretize the domain with a uniform spatial step $\\Delta x$ and time step $\\Delta t$. Let $u_j^n$ denote the numerical approximation of the solution $u(j\\Delta x, n\\Delta t)$. The Courant number is defined as $\\nu = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$.\n\nA linear explicit finite difference scheme is defined as monotone if the update $u_j^{n+1}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of values from the previous time step, $u_k^n$, with non-negative coefficients that sum to $1$. That is, $u_j^{n+1} = \\sum_k c_k u_k^n$ where $c_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$ and $\\sum_k c_k = 1$. This is the definition of a convex combination.\n\nFirst, we analyze the upwind scheme. The scheme's formulation depends on the sign of the advection speed $a$.\n\nCase 1: $a > 0$. The characteristic direction is from left to right, so we use a backward difference for the spatial derivative, $u_x \\approx (u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n) / \\Delta x$. The forward-in-time, backward-in-space (FTBS) scheme is:\n$$\n\\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t} + a \\frac{u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta x} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $u_j^{n+1}$:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n) = u_j^n - \\nu (u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n)\n$$\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = (1 - \\nu) u_j^n + \\nu u_{j-1}^n\n$$\nThe coefficients are $c_j = 1 - \\nu$ and $c_{j-1} = \\nu$. For the scheme to be monotone, these coefficients must be non-negative. Since $a > 0$, $\\Delta t > 0$, and $\\Delta x > 0$, we have $\\nu > 0$, so the condition $\\nu \\ge 0$ is satisfied. The other condition is $1 - \\nu \\ge 0$, which implies $\\nu \\le 1$. The sum of the coefficients is $(1 - \\nu) + \\nu = 1$. Thus, for $a > 0$, the monotonicity condition is $0 < \\nu \\le 1$.\n\nCase 2: $a < 0$. The characteristic direction is from right to left, so we use a forward difference for the spatial derivative, $u_x \\approx (u_{j+1}^n - u_j^n) / \\Delta x$. The forward-in-time, forward-in-space (FTFS) scheme is:\n$$\n\\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t} + a \\frac{u_{j+1}^n - u_j^n}{\\Delta x} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $u_j^{n+1}$:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (u_{j+1}^n - u_j^n) = u_j^n - \\nu (u_{j+1}^n - u_j^n)\n$$\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = (1 + \\nu) u_j^n - \\nu u_{j+1}^n\n$$\nThe coefficients are $c_j = 1 + \\nu$ and $c_{j+1} = -\\nu$.

In our derivations for both schemes, we enforced the conditions that the stencil coefficients must be non-negative and sum to $1$. These are precisely the defining properties of the coefficients in a convex combination. Thus, the derived CFL conditions are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the one-step updates of these schemes to be convex combinations of neighboring values.\n\nFinally, we must find the single tightest upper bound on the time step $\\Delta t$ that guarantees both schemes are monotone simultaneously.\nThe condition for the upwind scheme to be monotone is $\\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1$.\nThe condition for the Lax–Friedrichs scheme to be monotone is also $\\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1$.\nSince both schemes impose the exact same condition, the condition for them to be simultaneously monotone is this same condition. To find the maximal allowable $\\Delta t$, we solve the inequality for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n|a| \\Delta t \\le \\Delta x\n$$\nSince $a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, $|a|$ is a positive constant, so we can divide by it without changing the inequality direction:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|}\n$$\nThe tightest upper bound on $\\Delta t$ is the maximum value it can take, which is the right-hand side of this inequality.\nThe maximal allowable $\\Delta t$ is $\\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\Delta x}{|a|}}$$", "id": "3401094"}, {"introduction": "While monotone schemes are robust, their accuracy is limited.

The problem specifies the formula:\n    $$\n    u_{i+1/2}^{-} = \\bar{u}_i + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\sigma_i\n    $$\n    where $\\sigma_i$ is a quantity representing the slope-related variation across cell $i$. The periodic boundary conditions are handled by identifying cell indices modulo $N$, e.g., $\\bar{u}_{-1} = \\bar{u}_{N-1}$ and $\\bar{u}_{N} = \\bar{u}_{0}$.\n\n3.  **Slope Calculation**:\n    Two choices for the slope term $\\sigma_i$ are implemented to compare a standard second-order scheme with a Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) scheme.\n    -   **Unlimited Central Slope**: This choice leads to a linear, non-monotone second-order scheme. The slope term is defined as:\n        $$\n        \\sigma_i^{\\text{unlim}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\bar{u}_{i+1}-\\bar{u}_{i-1}\\right)\n        $$\n    -   **Limited Minmod Slope**: This choice employs the `minmod` function to limit the slopes, ensuring the scheme is TVD. This prevents spurious oscillations near sharp gradients but can reduce the order of accuracy. The slope term is:\n        $$\n        \\sigma_i^{\\text{mm}} = \\operatorname{minmod}\\left(\\bar{u}_i - \\bar{u}_{i-1},\\; \\bar{u}_{i+1}-\\bar{u}_i\\right)\n        $$\n        The `minmod` function is defined as $\\operatorname{minmod}(a,b) = \\operatorname{sign}(a)\\,\\min(|a|,|b|)$ if $ab>0$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n    The right-hand side of the semi-discrete system, which we can denote as $L(\\bar{\\mathbf{u}})$, is computed for all cells $i=0, \\dots, N-1$ at each time step.\n\n4.  **Time Integration**:\n    The system of ODEs is advanced in time using the third-order Strong Stability Preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK3) method. Given a solution $\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^n$ at time $t_n$, the solution at $t_{n+1} = t_n+\\Delta t$ is computed through three stages:\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    \\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^{(1)} &= \\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^n + \\Delta t L(\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^n) \\\\\n    \\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^{(2)} &= \\frac{3}{4}\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^n + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^{(1)} + \\Delta t L(\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^{(1)})\\right) \\\\\n    \\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^{n+1} &= \\frac{1}{3}\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^n + \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^{(2)} + \\Delta t L(\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}^{(2)})\\right)\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n    The time step $\\Delta t$ is chosen based on a fixed Courant number $\\nu = 0.4$, where the target time step is $\\Delta t_{\\text{target}} = \\nu \\Delta x/a$. To reach the final time $T=1$ exactly, we calculate the number of steps as $N_{\\text{steps}} = \\lceil T/\\Delta t_{\\text{target}} \\rceil$ and adjust the time step to $\\Delta t = T/N_{\\text{steps}}$.\n\n5.  **Error Analysis and Convergence Order**:\n    After evolving the solution to $T=1$, the error is computed with respect to the exact solution $u_0(x_i)$. The error vector is $e_i = \\bar{u}_i(T) - u_0(x_i)$. Two error norms are calculated:\n    $$\n    \\|e\\|_{L^1} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} |e_i|\\,\\Delta x, \\qquad \\|e\\|_{L^\\infty} = \\max_{0\\le i \\le N-1} |e_i|\n    $$\n    This process is repeated for a sequence of refined meshes with $N \\in \\{64, 128, 256, 512\\}$. The observed order of accuracy $p$ is estimated between two successive grid refinements using the formula:\n    $$\n    p = \\frac{\\log\\left(E(N)/E(2N)\\right)}{\\log 2}\n    $$\n    where $E(N)$ is a given error norm for a grid with $N$ cells. The final reported order is the average of the orders computed from the $(N=128 \\to 256)$ and $(N=256 \\to 512)$ refinements. This is done for all four combinations of slope choice and error norm, as requested. The expected results are consistent with Godunov's order barrier theorem and the theory of TVD schemes: second-order accuracy for the unlimited scheme, but a reduction to first-order in the $L^\\infty$ norm for the limited scheme due to clipping at smooth extrema.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements and analyzes a second-order finite volume method for the\n    linear advection equation to verify its convergence properties with\n    different slope limiters, in accordance with Godunov's theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def rhs(u_bar, dx, a, limiter_type):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the right-hand-side of the semi-discrete finite volume scheme.\n        d(u_bar)/dt = L(u_bar)\n        \n        Args:\n            u_bar (np.ndarray): Array of cell averages.\n            dx (float): Cell width.\n            a (float): Advection speed.\n            limiter_type (str): 'unlimited' or 'minmod'.\n            \n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: The time derivative of cell averages.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Enforce periodic boundary conditions using np.roll\n        u_L = np.roll(u_bar, 1)  # u_{i-1}\n        u_R = np.roll(u_bar, -1) # u_{i+1}\n\n        # Calculate slopes based on the chosen limiter\n        if limiter_type == 'unlimited':\n            # Unlimited central difference slope term\n            sigma = 0.5 * (u_R - u_L)\n        elif limiter_type == 'minmod':\n            # Minmod limited slope term\n            delta_L = u_bar - u_L\n            delta_R = u_R - u_bar\n            ab = delta_L * delta_R\n            sigma = np.zeros_like(u_bar)\n            mask = ab > 0\n            sigma[mask] = np.sign(delta_L[mask]) * np.minimum(np.abs(delta_L[mask]), np.abs(delta_R[mask]))\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Unknown limiter type: {limiter_type}\")\n\n        # Reconstruct state at the left side of the interface i+1/2\n        u_minus_at_i_plus_half = u_bar + 0.5 * sigma\n        \n        # Godunov upwind flux for a > 0\n        flux_i_plus_half = a * u_minus_at_i_plus_half\n\n        # Flux at i-1/2 by rolling the F_{i+1/2} array\n        flux_i_minus_half = np.roll(flux_i_plus_half, 1)\n        \n        # Compute the semi-discrete update\n        dudt = -(flux_i_plus_half - flux_i_minus_half) / dx\n        return dudt\n\n    def run_simulation(N, limiter_type, a, T, nu):\n        \"\"\"\n        Runs a single numerical simulation for a given grid size and limiter.\n\n        Args:\n            N (int): Number of grid cells.\n            limiter_type (str): 'unlimited' or 'minmod'.\n            a (float): Advection speed.\n            T (float): Final time.\n            nu (float): Courant number.\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple (float, float): L-infinity and L-1 errors.\n        \"\"\"\n        # --- Grid and Initial Condition ---\n        dx = 1.0 / N\n        x = (np.arange(N) + 0.5) * dx\n        \n        def u0_func(x_coords):\n            return np.sin(2 * np.pi * x_coords) + 0.25 * np.sin(6 * np.pi * x_coords)\n\n        u_exact = u0_func(x)\n        u = u_exact.copy()\n\n        # --- Time Stepping ---\n        # Adjust dt to hit the final time T exactly\n        dt_target = nu * dx / a\n        num_steps = int(np.ceil(T / dt_target))\n        dt = T / num_steps\n\n        # --- SSP-RK3 Time Integration Loop ---\n        for _ in range(num_steps):\n            # Stage 1\n            u1 = u + dt * rhs(u, dx, a, limiter_type)\n            # Stage 2\n            u2 = 0.75 * u + 0.25 * (u1 + dt * rhs(u1, dx, a, limiter_type))\n            # Stage 3\n            u = (1.0 / 3.0) * u + (2.0 / 3.0) * (u2 + dt * rhs(u2, dx, a, limiter_type))\n\n        # --- Error Calculation ---\n        error_vec = u - u_exact\n        err_linf = np.max(np.abs(error_vec))\n        err_l1 = np.sum(np.abs(error_vec)) * dx\n        \n        return err_linf, err_l1\n\n    # --- Main Driver ---\n    # Parameters for the numerical experiment\n    a = 1.0\n    T = 1.0\n    nu = 0.4\n    N_list = [64, 128, 256, 512]\n    \n    # Store errors for each case\n    errors = {\n        'unlimited': {'L_inf': {}, 'L_1': {}},\n        'minmod': {'L_inf': {}, 'L_1': {}}\n    }\n    \n    # Run simulations for all specified grid sizes and limiters\n    for limiter in ['unlimited', 'minmod']:\n        for N in N_list:\n            err_linf, err_l1 = run_simulation(N, limiter, a, T, nu)\n            errors[limiter]['L_inf'][N] = err_linf\n            errors[limiter]['L_1'][N] = err_l1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    # --- Calculate and store observed orders of accuracy ---\n    def calculate_avg_order(error_dict):\n        p_128_256 = np.log(error_dict[128] / error_dict[256]) / np.log(2)\n        p_256_512 = np.log(error_dict[256] / error_dict[512]) / np.log(2)\n        return (p_128_256 + p_256_512) / 2.0\n\n    # 1.
