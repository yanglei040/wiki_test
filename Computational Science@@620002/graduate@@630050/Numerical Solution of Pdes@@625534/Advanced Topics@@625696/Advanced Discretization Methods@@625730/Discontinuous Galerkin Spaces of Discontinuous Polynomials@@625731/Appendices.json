This space consists of all multivariate polynomials in $d$ spatial variables with a total degree of at most $p$. Since the elements are affine images of a reference element, the dimension of the polynomial space is invariant. We can therefore determine the dimension by considering the space of polynomials on the reference element.\n\nA basis for this polynomial space is formed by the set of all monomials of the form $x_1^{\\alpha_1} x_2^{\\alpha_2} \\cdots x_d^{\\alpha_d}$, where the exponents $\\alpha_i$ are non-negative integers that satisfy the condition:\n$$\n\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\cdots + \\alpha_d \\le p\n$$\nThe dimension of the space is equal to the number of such monomials.

This is a classic stars and bars problem: we have $p$ \"stars\" (units) to distribute among $d+1$ \"bins\" (the variables $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_{d+1}$). This is equivalent to arranging $p$ stars and $(d+1)-1 = d$ bars in a sequence. The total number of positions is $p+d$, and we need to choose $d$ of these positions for the bars.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in the field of numerical analysis for partial differential equations, specifically concerning the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. All necessary components are provided, and there are no scientific or logical contradictions.\n\nWe begin by deriving the semidiscrete formulation for the linear advection equation, $\\partial_{t} u + a\\,\\partial_{x} u = 0$, on an element $K_j = [x_{j-1/2}, x_{j+1/2}]$. We multiply the PDE by a test function $v_h \\in \\mathbb{V}_{h}^{p}$ and integrate over $K_j$:\n$$\n\\int_{K_j} \\partial_t u_h(x,t) v_h(x) \\,dx + \\int_{K_j} a\\,\\partial_x u_h(x,t) v_h(x) \\,dx = 0.\n$$\nApplying integration by parts to the second term (the advection term) yields:\n$$\n\\int_{K_j} a\\,\\partial_x u_h v_h \\,dx = \\left[ a u_h v_h \\right]_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} - \\int_{K_j} a u_h \\partial_x v_h \\,dx.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the first equation, we obtain the weak formulation on element $K_j$:\n$$\n\\int_{K_j} \\partial_t u_h v_h \\,dx - \\int_{K_j} a u_h \\partial_x v_h \\,dx + \\left[ a u_h v_h \\right]_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} = 0.\n$$\nThe boundary term is expanded as $a u_h(x_{j+1/2}^-)v_h(x_{j+1/2}^-) - a u_h(x_{j-1/2}^-)v_h(x_{j-1/2}^-)$, where the notation $u_h(x^\\pm)$ denotes the trace of the function $u_h$ from the left ($x^-$) or right ($x^+$) of an interface. Since $v_h$ is a test function within $K_j$, its traces are single-valued, i.e., $v_h(x_{j+1/2}^-)=v_h(x_{j+1/2})$ and $v_h(x_{j-1/2}^-)=v_h(x_{j-1/2})$.\n\nTo ensure communication between elements, the physical flux $a u_h$ at the interfaces is replaced by a numerical flux, denoted $f^*(u_h^-, u_h^+)$. For the given problem with advection speed $a>0$, the upwind flux is appropriate, where information propagates from left to right. Thus, the flux is determined by the \"upwind\" state, which is the state to the left of the interface: $f^*(u_h^-, u_h^+) = a u_h^-$.\nAt the right boundary of $K_j$, $x_{j+1/2}$, the upwind state is the interior trace from $K_j$, i.e., $u_h(x_{j+1/2}^-)$.\nAt the left boundary of $K_j$, $x_{j-1/2}$, the upwind state is the interior trace from the neighboring element to the left, $K_{j-1}$, i.e., $u_h(x_{j-1/2}^-)|_{K_{j-1}}$. Due to periodic boundary conditions, for $j=1$, the neighbor to the left is $K_N$.\n\nThe weak form with the numerical flux becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{K_j} u_h v_h \\,dx = \\int_{K_j} a u_h \\partial_x v_h \\,dx - a u_h(x_{j+1/2}^-)|_{K_j} v_h(x_{j+1/2}) + a u_h(x_{j-1/2}^-)|_{K_{j-1}} v_h(x_{j-1/2}).\n$$\nWe now introduce the specified modal basis. On each element $K_j$, the solution $u_h$ is represented as a linear combination of Legendre polynomials $L_i(\\xi)$, where $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$ is the reference coordinate:\n$$\nu_h(x,t)|_{K_j} = \\sum_{i=0}^{p} \\hat{u}_{j,i}(t) L_i(\\xi(x)).\n$$\nWe choose the test functions $v_h$ to be the basis functions themselves, i.e., $v_h(x) = L_k(\\xi(x))$ for $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, p\\}$. The mapping from the physical coordinate $x$ to the reference coordinate $\\xi$ is $x = x_j + \\frac{h}{2}\\xi$, which implies $dx = \\frac{h}{2}d\\xi$ and $\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{2}{h}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}$.\n\nSubstituting the expansion into the left-hand side (LHS) of the weak form:\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{K_j} \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{p} \\hat{u}_{j,i}(t) L_i(\\xi) \\right) L_k(\\xi) \\,dx = \\sum_{i=0}^{p} \\dot{\\hat{u}}_{j,i}(t) \\int_{K_j} L_i(\\xi) L_k(\\xi) \\,dx.\n$$\nChanging to reference coordinates, the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} L_i(\\xi) L_k(\\xi) \\frac{h}{2} \\,d\\xi = \\frac{h}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} L_i(\\xi) L_k(\\xi) \\,d\\xi.\n$$\nWe use the fundamental orthogonality property of Legendre polynomials: $\\int_{-1}^{1} L_i(\\xi)L_k(\\xi) \\,d\\xi = \\frac{2}{2i+1}\\delta_{ik}$, where $\\delta_{ik}$ is the Kronecker delta.\nThe LHS thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{p} \\dot{\\hat{u}}_{j,i}(t) \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\frac{2}{2i+1} \\delta_{ik} \\right) = \\dot{\\hat{u}}_{j,k}(t) \\frac{h}{2k+1}.\n$$\nThis expression defines the $k$-th row of the local system for element $K_j$. The coefficients form the local mass matrix $M^{(j)}$. For each $j$, this gives a system $M^{(j)}\\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}}_j(t)$, where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}_j$ is the vector of coefficients $\\{\\hat{u}_{j,i}\\}_{i=0}^p$. The entries of the local mass matrix are:\n$$\n(M^{(j)})_{ki} = \\frac{h}{2k+1}\\delta_{ki}.\n$$\nThe right-hand side (RHS) of the weak form constitutes the components of the vector $\\boldsymbol{f}_j(\\boldsymbol{u})$. Assembling these equations for all elements $j=1, \\dots, N$ yields the global semidiscrete ODE system $M\\,\\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}(t) = \\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u}(t))$, where $M$ is the block-diagonal global mass matrix with blocks $M^{(j)}$, and $\\boldsymbol{f}$ contains all spatial contributions.\n\nThe problem requires the explicit form of the local mass matrix $M^{(j)}$ and its inverse. As derived, due to the orthogonality of the Legendre basis, $M^{(j)}$ is a diagonal matrix with entries:\n$$\n(M^{(j)})_{ii} = \\frac{h}{2i+1} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{0, \\dots, p\\}.\n$$\nThe inverse of a diagonal matrix is simply the diagonal matrix of the reciprocals of the original entries. Therefore, the local inverse mass matrix $(M^{(j)})^{-1}$ is also diagonal, with entries:\n$$\n((M^{(j)})^{-1})_{ii} = \\left(\\frac{h}{2i+1}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{2i+1}{h}.\n$$\n\nFinally, we discuss the computational implications of this result for time integration schemes. The ODE system is $M \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}} = \\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u})$, or $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}} = M^{-1}\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u})$.\n\nFor an explicit time integration scheme, such as a Runge-Kutta method, each stage requires evaluating the RHS, $M^{-1}\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u})$. The global mass matrix $M$ is block-diagonal, composed of the local matrices $M^{(j)}$. Consequently, its inverse $M^{-1}$ is also block-diagonal, with blocks $(M^{(j)})^{-1}$. The operation $\\boldsymbol{w} = M^{-1}\\boldsymbol{g}$ can be performed element-by-element: $\\boldsymbol{w}_j = (M^{(j)})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{g}_j$. Since $(M^{(j)})^{-1}$ is a diagonal matrix, this matrix-vector multiplication is computationally trivial, reducing to a scalar multiplication for each mode:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{w}_j)_i = ((M^{(j)})^{-1})_{ii} (\\boldsymbol{g}_j)_i = \\frac{2i+1}{h}(\\boldsymbol{g}_j)_i.\n$$\nThe total cost is linear in the number of degrees of freedom, $O(N(p+1))$. This \"mass lumping\" is an automatic consequence of the orthogonal modal basis, making explicit DG methods very efficient. If a non-orthogonal basis (e.g., a nodal basis) were used, $M^{(j)}$ would be a dense matrix, and computing $(M^{(j)})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{g}_j$ would require solving a small linear system on each element, typically costing $O(p^3)$ work, which is significantly more expensive for high-order methods (large $p$).\n\nFor an implicit time integration scheme, such as Backward Euler, one must solve a linear system at each time step: $(M - \\Delta t K)\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = M \\boldsymbol{u}^n$, where $K$ is the matrix representation of the spatial operator $\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u})$. This large, sparse global system is typically solved with an iterative method like GMRES. Each iteration requires matrix-vector products with the system matrix $(M-\\Delta t K)$. The application of $M$ within this product is, as noted, computationally inexpensive due to its diagonal structure. Furthermore, iterative solvers require a preconditioner for efficient convergence. The mass matrix $M$ itself serves as an excellent and cheap preconditioner. Applying the preconditioner involves solving systems of the form $M\\boldsymbol{z}=\\boldsymbol{r}$, which is precisely the efficient operation $\\boldsymbol{z}=M^{-1}\\boldsymbol{r}$ discussed for explicit methods. The choice of an orthogonal modal basis is therefore highly advantageous for both explicit and implicit schemes, as it renders the mass matrix diagonal, simplifying time-stepping algorithms and reducing computational cost.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form expression for the diagonal entries of the local inverse mass matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2i+1}{h}}$$", "id": "3379043"}, {"introduction": "Many physical phenomena are governed by nonlinear equations, which introduce new challenges in the DG formulation.
