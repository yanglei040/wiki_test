The physical context is the gauge group $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ with a single complex Higgs doublet of hypercharge $Y = \\tfrac{1}{2}$ acquiring a nonzero vacuum expectation value. The program must clearly separate the On-Shell scheme (OS) and the Modified Minimal Subtraction scheme ($\\overline{\\text{MS}}$), and quantify the scheme dependence of the weak mixing angle.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Start from the gauge-covariant derivative acting on the Higgs doublet, $D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i \\, \\frac{g}{2} \\tau^a W^a_\\mu - i \\, g' Y B_\\mu$, where $g$ and $g'$ are the $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$ gauge couplings, $\\tau^a$ are the Pauli matrices, $W^a_\\mu$ are the weak gauge fields, and $B_\\mu$ is the hypercharge gauge field.\n- After Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB), the Higgs doublet may be parametrized as $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\tfrac{v + h(x)}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$, where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value and $h(x)$ is the physical Higgs fluctuation.

The model must handle two distinct renormalization schemes, the On-Shell (OS) and Modified Minimal Subtraction ($\\overline{\\text{MS}}$) schemes, and quantify their difference. The foundation of this calculation is the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism via the Higgs field.\n\nThe process begins with the kinetic term for the complex Higgs doublet $H$, which has hypercharge $Y = \\frac{1}{2}$. The Lagrangian density for this term is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{kin}} = (D_\\mu H)^\\dagger (D^\\mu H)$, where the gauge-covariant derivative $D_\\mu$ for the $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ gauge group is given by:\n$$\nD_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i \\frac{g}{2} \\tau^a W^a_\\mu - i g' Y B_\\mu\n$$\nHere, $g$ and $g'$ are the gauge couplings for $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$ respectively, $\\tau^a$ are the three Pauli matrices (with $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$), $W^a_\\mu$ are the $SU(2)_L$ gauge fields, and $B_\\mu$ is the $U(1)_Y$ gauge field.\n\nAfter EWSB, the Higgs field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV), $v$. In the unitary gauge, the Higgs doublet takes the form $H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ v+h(x) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $h(x)$ represents the fluctuation of the physical Higgs boson. The mass terms for the gauge bosons arise from the kinetic term evaluated at the vacuum, i.e., setting $h(x)=0$ and $\\partial_\\mu H = 0$. We evaluate $D_\\mu$ acting on the vacuum state $H_{\\text{vac}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\nD_\\mu H_{\\text{vac}} = -i \\left( \\frac{g}{2} (\\tau^a W^a_\\mu) + \\frac{g'}{2} I B_\\mu \\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe term $\\tau^a W^a_\\mu$ can be written in matrix form as $\\begin{pmatrix} W^3_\\mu & W^1_\\mu - iW^2_\\mu \\\\ W^1_\\mu + iW^2_\\mu & -W^3_\\mu \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} W^3_\\mu & \\sqrt{2}W^+_\\mu \\\\ \\sqrt{2}W^-_\\mu & -W^3_\\mu \\end{pmatrix}$, where $W^\\pm_\\mu = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(W^1_\\mu \\mp iW^2_\\mu)$.

The standard Lagrangian form for a massive complex vector boson is $M_W^2 W^+_\\mu W^{-\\mu}$ and for real vector bosons is $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{V}_\\mu^T M^2 \\mathbf{V}^\\mu$.\n\nFor the charged sector, by direct comparison, the squared mass of the $W$ boson is $M_W^2 = \\frac{g^2 v^2}{4}$. The algorithmic step is to calculate $M_W = \\frac{gv}{2}$.\n\nFor the neutral sector, the fields $W^3_\\mu$ and $B_\\mu$ mix. The mass terms can be written in a matrix form $\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} W^3_\\mu & B_\\mu \\end{pmatrix} M_{\\text{neutral}}^2 \\begin{pmatrix} W^{3\\mu} \\\\ B^{\\mu} \\end{pmatrix}$. By comparing the expanded matrix form with our derived Lagrangian term, we deduce the neutral-boson mass-squared matrix:\n$$\nM_{\\text{neutral}}^2 = \\frac{v^2}{4} \\begin{pmatrix} g^2 & -gg' \\\\ -gg' & g'^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe physical states are the eigenvectors of this matrix. The eigenvalues of $M_{\\text{neutral}}^2$ correspond to the squared masses of the physical neutral bosons. The program will construct this $2 \\times 2$ matrix and numerically find its eigenvalues. Analytically, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ (corresponding to the massless photon, $A_\\mu$) and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{v^2}{4} (g^2 + g'^2)$ (corresponding to the massive $Z$ boson). Thus, $M_Z^2 = \\frac{v^2(g^2+g'^2)}{4}$.\n\nThe calculation is performed in two schemes:\n1.  **On-Shell (OS) Scheme**: This scheme uses input values $v$, $g_0$, and $g'_0$ at a reference scale $\\mu_0$. The masses $M_W^{\\text{OS}}$ and $M_Z^{\\text{OS}}$ are computed from the formulae above using these direct inputs. The weak mixing angle in this scheme, $s_{\\text{OS}}^2$, is defined through the ratio of the physical masses: $s_{\\text{OS}}^2 = 1 - \\frac{(M_W^{\\text{OS}})^2}{(M_Z^{\\text{OS}})^2}$.\n\n2.  **Modified Minimal Subtraction ($\\overline{\\text{MS}}$) Scheme**: This scheme employs running couplings, $g(\\mu)$ and $g'(\\mu)$, defined at an energy scale $\\mu$. The evolution of the couplings from a reference scale $\\mu_0$ to $\\mu$ is governed by the one-loop Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs): $\\frac{d g_i}{d \\ln \\mu} = \\frac{b_i}{16\\pi^2} g_i^3$. Integrating this equation yields the solution for the running coupling squared:\n    $$\n    g_i(\\mu)^2 = \\frac{g_i(\\mu_0)^2}{1 - \\frac{b_i g_i(\\mu_0)^2}{8\\pi^2} \\ln(\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_0})}\n    $$\n    The program implements this formula for $g(\\mu)$ (using $b_2 = -19/6$) and $g'(\\mu)$ (using $b_1 = 41/6$). The $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ masses, $M_W^{\\overline{\\text{MS}}}(\\mu)$ and $M_Z^{\\overline{\\text{MS}}}(\\mu)$, are then calculated using the same mass formulae but with these running couplings. The $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ weak mixing angle, $s_{\\overline{\\text{MS}}}^2(\\mu)$, is defined directly from the running couplings: $s_{\\overline{\\text{MS}}}^2(\\mu) = \\frac{g'(\\mu)^2}{g(\\mu)^2 + g'(\\mu)^2}$.\n\nFinally, the scheme dependence of the weak mixing angle is quantified by $\\Delta s^2 = s_{\\overline{\\text{MS}}}^2(\\mu) - s_{\\text{OS}}^2$. The numerical implementation uses `numpy` for efficient array operations and for the diagonalization of the neutral mass matrix via `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh`, which is suitable for Hermitian (and thus real symmetric) matrices.

Thus, the $\\beta_0$ coefficient is a constant:\n$$\n\\beta_0 = 11 - \\frac{2}{3} (5) = \\frac{33}{3} - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{23}{3}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the integrated form of the one-loop RGE, which expresses $\\alpha_s$ at a scale $\\mu$ in terms of a fundamental QCD parameter, $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$. This parameter, the QCD scale, is an integration constant that represents the scale at which the coupling, within this one-loop approximation, would diverge.\n$$\n\\alpha_s(\\mu) = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\ln\\!\\left( \\mu^2 / \\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}^2 \\right)}\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x^2) = 2\\ln(x)$, this can be simplified to a more computationally convenient form:\n$$\n\\alpha_s(\\mu) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\ln\\!\\left( \\mu / \\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}} \\right)}\n$$\nThis formula is the basis for all subsequent calculations.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation and computation of $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$.**\nTo compute $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$, we must rearrange the one-loop formula for $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ to solve for $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$. We are given a reference point: $\\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.118$ at the scale of the Z boson mass, $M_Z = 91.1876 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$.\nStarting with the formula and substituting $\\mu = M_Z$:\n$$\n\\alpha_s(M_Z) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\ln\\!\\left( M_Z / \\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}} \\right)}\n$$\nWe solve for the term containing $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$:\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{M_Z}{\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}} }\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\alpha_s(M_Z)}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$:\n$$\n\\ln(M_Z) - \\ln(\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\alpha_s(M_Z)}\n$$\nIsolating $\\ln(\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}})$:\n$$\n\\ln(\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}) = \\ln(M_Z) - \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\alpha_s(M_Z)}\n$$\nFinally, we exponentiate both sides to obtain the explicit expression for $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$:\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}} = \\exp\\left( \\ln(M_Z) - \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\alpha_s(M_Z)} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be written more compactly as:\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}} = M_Z \\exp\\left( - \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\alpha_s(M_Z)} \\right)\n$$\nThis derived formula will be implemented to compute the numerical value of $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$ using the provided constants: $M_Z = 91.1876 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.118$, and the calculated $\\beta_0 = 23/3$.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$ for arbitrary scales.**\nWith the numerical value of $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$ determined from Task 1, we can compute the value of the strong coupling at any energy scale $\\mu$ using the one-loop formula:\n$$\n\\alpha_s(\\mu) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta_0 \\ln\\!\\left( \\mu / \\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}} \\right)}\n$$\nThis function will be evaluated for the specified test suite of scales: $\\mu \\in \\{5.0, 10.0, 91.1876, 150.0, 4.5\\} \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$. An important assumption, as directed by the problem, is that $n_f=5$ remains fixed for all these scales. In a more sophisticated analysis, $n_f$ would change as $\\mu$ crosses quark mass thresholds (e.g., the bottom quark mass $m_b \\approx 4.2 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$), and the coupling would be matched at these thresholds. The fixed-$n_f$ approach is a simplification that is valid far from thresholds but less accurate near them. The evaluation at $\\mu = 91.1876 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$ serves as a consistency check, and should return the input value $\\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.118$, up to floating-point precision.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the relative deviation $\\delta$.**\nThe problem requires a comparison of the calculated $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$ with an experimental reference value, $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}^{\\mathrm{(ref)}} = 0.213 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$. This reference value is typically obtained from global fits to experimental data using higher-order (e.g., 3- or 4-loop) RGE solutions. A discrepancy is therefore expected, and its magnitude quantifies the impact of the neglected higher-order terms in our one-loop approximation. The relative deviation, $\\delta$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}} - \\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}^{\\mathrm{(ref)}}}{\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}^{\\mathrm{(ref)}}}\n$$\nThis value will be computed using our result for $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$ from Task 1 and the given $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}^{\\mathrm{(ref)}}$.\n\nThe final implementation will assemble these three tasks into a single program, computing the seven required quantities: $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}$, the five values of $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$, and the relative deviation $\\delta$.

Numerically, we must retain the full propagators and verify that the result remains unchanged across a range of $\\xi$ values.\n\nDifferential and total cross sections:\nThe unpolarized differential cross section in the center-of-mass frame is\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{64\\pi^2 s}\\frac{|\\mathbf{p}_f|}{|\\mathbf{p}_i|}\\overline{|\\mathcal{M}|}^2.\n$$\nWith massless external particles, $|\\mathbf{p}_i| = |\\mathbf{p}_f| = \\sqrt{s}/2$. We integrate over the solid angle to obtain the total cross section\n$$\n\\sigma(s) = \\int d\\Omega \\,\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = 2\\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} d(\\cos\\theta)\\,\\frac{1}{64\\pi^2 s}\\,\\overline{|\\mathcal{M}|}^2(\\cos\\theta),\n$$\nusing a numerical quadrature over $\\cos\\theta \\in [-1,1]$. Finally, convert $\\sigma$ from $\\text{GeV}^{-2}$ to picobarns (pb) using $1~\\text{GeV}^{-2} = 0.389379338\\times 10^9~\\text{pb}$.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Implement $\\gamma^\\mu$ matrices in the Dirac representation and $\\gamma^5 = i \\gamma^0\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\gamma^3$. Build $\\slashed{p} = p_\\mu \\gamma^\\mu$.\n- For each mediator $i\\in\\{\\gamma,Z\\}$, build the rank-2 propagator tensor $D_{\\mu\\nu}^{(i)}(k)$ for given $\\xi_\\gamma,\\xi_Z$.\n- For each pair $(i,j)$, form spin tensors by evaluating the Dirac traces:\n$$\nL^{\\mu\\rho}_{(ij)}(p_1,p_2) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\left[\\slashed{p}_1 \\Gamma_i^\\mu \\slashed{p}_2 \\bar{\\Gamma}_j^\\rho\\right],\\quad\nH^{\\nu\\sigma}_{(ij)}(p_3,p_4) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\left[\\slashed{p}_3 \\Gamma_i^\\nu \\slashed{p}_4 \\bar{\\Gamma}_j^\\sigma\\right].\n$$\n- Contract indices to get the spin-summed squared amplitude:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\text{spins}}|\\mathcal{M}|^2 = \\sum_{i,j} D_{\\mu\\nu}^{(i)} [D_{\\rho\\sigma}^{(j)}]^* L^{\\mu\\rho}_{(ij)} H^{\\nu\\sigma}_{(ij)}.\n$$\nThen average by dividing by $4$.\n- Numerically integrate over $\\cos\\theta$ via Gauss–Legendre quadrature with sufficient points to ensure accuracy (for example $N=200$ nodes).\n- Evaluate the cross section for each test case in the specified suite and print the list of results in pb, each rounded to six decimal places.\n- Explicit ghost contribution check: the ghost fields $c_\\gamma, c_Z$ do not have vertices with external fermion bilinears; therefore there are no tree-level diagrams with internal ghost lines for $e^- e^+ \\to \\mu^- \\mu^+$. As a result, their explicit contribution at tree level is identically zero. The numerical $\\xi$-independence is thus a consequence of current conservation in the $R_\\xi$ propagators.\n\nScientific realism and edge cases:\n- We avoid $\\sqrt{s}$ values exactly at the $Z$ pole to prevent singularities in the tree-level propagator without a width.\n- We include a range of $\\xi$ values (less than, equal to, and greater than $1$) to validate gauge-parameter independence robustly.\n- We maintain physical constants at accepted values and use massless $e,\\mu$, which is an excellent approximation at the energies considered.\n\nThe final program follows this plan, computes all required traces and contractions explicitly, and prints the list of seven cross sections in picobarns with six decimal places, proving $\\xi$-independence numerically within integration precision.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants (natural units, hbar=c=1)\nalpha = 1.0 / 137.035999084\nsw2 = 0.23126\nsw = np.sqrt(sw2)\ncw = np.sqrt(1.0 -
