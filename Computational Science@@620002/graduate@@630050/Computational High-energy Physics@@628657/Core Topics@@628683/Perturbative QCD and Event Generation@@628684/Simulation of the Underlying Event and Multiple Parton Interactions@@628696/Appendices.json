It represents a standard theoretical derivation in the field of high-energy particle physics, specifically in the modeling of Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI). Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the probabilistic interpretation of a scattering cross section in the context of an impact-parameter picture. The inclusive cross section for a single hard process, for instance type $X$, is denoted by $\\sigma^{X}$. The problem specifies a normalized, non-negative impact-parameter profile $A(b)$, which describes the transverse spatial distribution of partonic interactions within the colliding protons. The normalization condition is given as $\\int d^{2}b\\,A(b)=1$, where $b$ is the magnitude of the transverse separation vector between the centers of the two protons.\n\nIn the semi-classical MPI model, the average number of hard scatterings of type $X$ occurring in a single proton-proton collision at a fixed impact parameter $b$, denoted $\\langle n_{X}(b) \\rangle$, is assumed to be proportional to both the single-scattering cross section $\\sigma^{X}$ and the transverse matter overlap function $A(b)$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\langle n_{X}(b) \\rangle = \\sigma^{X} A(b)\n$$\nThis form is valid under the assumption that hard scatterings are rare events, such that the probability of an interaction is well-approximated by the average number of interactions. The dimensionless nature of $\\langle n_{X}(b) \\rangle$ is preserved, as $\\sigma^{X}$ has units of area and $A(b)$ has units of inverse area.\n\nSimilarly, for a second, distinct hard process $Y$, the average number of scatterings at impact parameter $b$ is:\n$$\n\\langle n_{Y}(b) \\rangle = \\sigma^{Y} A(b)\n$$\nThe problem states that the two hard scatterings, $X$ and $Y$, are probabilistically independent. At a fixed impact parameter $b$, the average number of simultaneous double parton scattering (DPS) events, where one scattering is of type $X$ and the other is of type $Y$, is the product of their individual average numbers:\n$$\n\\langle n_{XY}(b) \\rangle = \\langle n_{X}(b) \\rangle \\langle n_{Y}(b) \\rangle\n$$\nThe lack of a symmetry factor of $1/2$ is because the final states $X$ and $Y$ are specified as distinct. If they were identical (e.g., process $X$ happening twice), a factor of $1/2$ would be needed to avoid double counting.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\langle n_{X}(b) \\rangle$ and $\\langle n_{Y}(b) \\rangle$, we obtain the average number of $XY$ pairs at impact parameter $b$:\n$$\n\\langle n_{XY}(b) \\rangle = (\\sigma^{X} A(b)) (\\sigma^{Y} A(b)) = \\sigma^{X}\\sigma^{Y} [A(b)]^{2}\n$$\nThe inclusive cross section for the double parton scattering process, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{DPS}}^{XY}$, is found by integrating this average number of pairs over all possible impact parameters:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{DPS}}^{XY} = \\int d^{2}b \\, \\langle n_{XY}(b) \\rangle = \\int d^{2}b \\, \\sigma^{X}\\sigma^{Y} [A(b)]^{2}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma^{X}$ and $\\sigma^{Y}$ are constants with respect to the integration over $b$, they can be factored out:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{DPS}}^{XY} = \\sigma^{X}\\sigma^{Y} \\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the inclusive DPS cross section.\n\nNext, we are given the definition of the effective cross section $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{DPS}}^{XY} = \\frac{\\sigma^{X}\\sigma^{Y}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nBy comparing this definition with the derived expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{DPS}}^{XY}$, we can identify an expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma^{X}\\sigma^{Y}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\sigma^{X}\\sigma^{Y} \\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2}\n$$\nAssuming $\\sigma^X > 0$ and $\\sigma^Y > 0$, we can cancel the term $\\sigma^{X}\\sigma^{Y}$ from both sides, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the effective cross section is the inverse of the integral of the squared impact-parameter profile:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1}{\\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2}}\n$$\nNow, we must compute $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the specific case of a Gaussian impact-parameter profile:\n$$\nA(b) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi B} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{b^{2}}{2B}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $B>0$ is the width parameter. We need to evaluate the integral $\\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2}$.

It is most conveniently evaluated in polar coordinates, where the differential area element is $d^{2}b = b \\, db \\, d\\phi$. The integration range is $b \\in [0, \\infty)$ and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n$$\n\\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} db \\, b \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{4\\pi^{2}B^{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{b^{2}}{B}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe integrand is independent of the angle $\\phi$, so the angular integration simply yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2} = 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{4\\pi^{2}B^{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} b \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{b^{2}}{B}\\right) db = \\frac{1}{2\\pi B^{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} b \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{b^{2}}{B}\\right) db\n$$\nTo solve the remaining radial integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = b^{2}/B$. Then $du = (2b/B)db$, which implies $b \\, db = (B/2)du$. The integration limits for $u$ remain $0$ and $\\infty$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} b \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{b^{2}}{B}\\right) db = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\left(\\frac{B}{2}\\right) du = \\frac{B}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) du\n$$\nThe integral of $\\exp(-u)$ from $0$ to $\\infty$ is a standard result:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) du = \\left[-\\exp(-u)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = (-\\exp(-\\infty)) - (-\\exp(0)) = 0 - (-1) = 1\n$$\nSo, the radial integral evaluates to $B/2$. Substituting this result back:\n$$\n\\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi B^{2}} \\left(\\frac{B}{2}\\right) = \\frac{B}{4\\pi B^{2}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi B}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using its definition:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1}{\\int d^{2}b \\, [A(b)]^{2}} = \\frac{1}{1/(4\\pi B)} = 4\\pi B\n$$\nThus, for a Gaussian impact-parameter profile with width parameter $B$, the effective cross section is $4\\pi B$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi B}\n$$", "id": "3535735"}, {"introduction": "Having established the static picture of MPI, we now investigate the dynamics of how the Underlying Event (UE) evolves with collision energy, $\\sqrt{s}$.

This exercise [@problem_id:3535737] guides you through the implementation of the veto algorithm, the workhorse of modern parton showers and MPI generators for producing a $p_T$-ordered sequence of emissions. By building a sampler for an interleaved MPI and radiation model and verifying its output against exact analytical results, you will gain hands-on experience with the core computational techniques that translate theoretical physics into predictive simulations.", "problem": "Implement a complete, runnable program that simulates an interleaved sequence of emissions in a Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI) plus Initial-State Radiation (ISR) toy model using a veto-based sampler, and verifies that the sampled transverse-momentum spectrum reproduces the analytically integrated rate within statistical uncertainties. The transverse momentum must be interpreted in gigaelectronvolts (GeV), and all integrals over transverse momentum must be expressed in GeV. The program must not require any input and must print a single line of output as specified below.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- The sequence of emissions is modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process in the evolution variable given by the transverse momentum $p_T$, with a total intensity (rate density) $f(p_T)$ that is the sum of two channel intensities,\n  $$ f(p_T) \\equiv f_1(p_T) + f_2(p_T), $$\n  representing Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI) and Initial-State Radiation (ISR), respectively. In this problem, use the specific forms\n  $$ f_1(p_T) = \\frac{A}{p_T + \\lambda_1}, \\quad f_2(p_T) = \\frac{B}{p_T + \\lambda_2}, $$\n  with strictly positive constants $A$, $B$, $\\lambda_1$, and $\\lambda_2$.\n- The evolution proceeds in $p_T$-ordering from an initial scale $Q$ down to a cutoff scale $p_{T0}$ (both in GeV). The probability of no emissions above a scale $p_T$ is given by the Sudakov form factor\n  $$ \\Delta_f(p_T \\mid Q) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\int_{p_T}^{Q} f(t)\\,dt\\right). $$\n- The veto algorithm is a rejection sampling method for non-homogeneous Poisson processes. To use it, construct an overestimate function $G(p_T)$ that satisfies $G(p_T) \\ge f(p_T)$ for all $p_T$ in $[p_{T0},Q]$, and that has an analytically invertible integral. In this problem, you must use\n  $$ G(p_T) = \\frac{A+B}{p_T + \\lambda_{\\min}}, \\quad \\lambda_{\\min} = \\min(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2), $$\n  which is a valid overestimate because $\\frac{A}{p_T+\\lambda_1} \\le \\frac{A}{p_T+\\lambda_{\\min}}$ and $\\frac{B}{p_T+\\lambda_2} \\le \\frac{B}{p_T+\\lambda_{\\min}}$ for all $p_T \\ge 0$, so $f_1(p_T)+f_2(p_T) \\le \\frac{A+B}{p_T+\\lambda_{\\min}}$.\n- The integrated intensities are\n  $$ I_1 = \\int_{p_{T0}}^{Q} f_1(t)\\,dt = A \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{Q+\\lambda_1}{p_{T0}+\\lambda_1}\\right), \\quad\n     I_2 = \\int_{p_{T0}}^{Q} f_2(t)\\,dt = B \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{Q+\\lambda_2}{p_{T0}+\\lambda_2}\\right), $$\n  and $I = I_1 + I_2$. The analytic probability of zero emissions above $p_{T0}$ is $\\Delta_f(p_{T0}\\mid Q) = e^{-I}$, and the mean number of emissions per event is $I$. For a sample of $N$ independent events, the sample mean emission multiplicity has standard deviation $\\sqrt{I/N}$, and the zero-emission fraction has standard deviation $\\sqrt{e^{-I}(1-e^{-I})/N}$ (all dimensionless).\n\nTask requirements:\n1. Implement a veto-based sampler that generates the full interleaved sequence of accepted emissions for each event, ordered in $p_T$ from $Q$ down to $p_{T0}$, using the specified $G(p_T)$. At each accepted emission, also perform channel selection between $f_1$ and $f_2$ with conditional probability proportional to their relative contributions at the accepted $p_T$.\n2. Run the simulation for a set of independent events for each parameter point in the test suite. Record:\n   - The total number of accepted emissions, $M$.\n   - The number of accepted emissions in channel $1$, $M_1$.\n   - The number of accepted emissions in channel $2$, $M_2$.\n   - The number of zero-emission events, $Z$.\n   Compute the following observables:\n   - The sample mean emission multiplicity per event, $\\hat{\\mu} = M/N$ (dimensionless).\n   - The analytic total integrated intensity $I$ (dimensionless), and the ratio $r_{\\text{tot}} = \\hat{\\mu}/I$.\n   - The $z$-score for the total mean, $z_{\\text{tot}} = (\\hat{\\mu} - I)/\\sqrt{I/N}$ (dimensionless).\n   - The sample zero-emission fraction, $\\hat{\\Delta} = Z/N$ (dimensionless), and its ratio to the analytic, $r_{0} = \\hat{\\Delta}/e^{-I}$.\n   - The $z$-score for the zero-emission fraction, $z_{0} = (\\hat{\\Delta} - e^{-I})/\\sqrt{e^{-I}(1-e^{-I})/N}$ (dimensionless).\n   - The sample mean multiplicities per channel, $\\hat{\\mu}_1 = M_1/N$ and $\\hat{\\mu}_2 = M_2/N$ (dimensionless), and their ratios to analytics $r_1 = \\hat{\\mu}_1/I_1$, $r_2 = \\hat{\\mu}_2/I_2$ (dimensionless).\n3. Use the fixed random seed $12345$ for reproducibility.\n4. Units: $p_T$, $Q$, $p_{T0}$, $\\lambda_1$, and $\\lambda_2$ must be interpreted in GeV; $A$, $B$, $I$, and all ratios and $z$-scores are dimensionless.\n5. Test suite: run your program for the following three parameter sets, each with $N$ events:\n   - Case A (general): $A = 0.8$, $B = 0.6$, $\\lambda_1 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\lambda_2 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $Q = 50.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $p_{T0} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $N = 100000$.\n   - Case B (low activity / near zero-emission boundary): $A = 0.05$, $B = 0.02$, $\\lambda_1 = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\lambda_2 = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $Q = 100.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $p_{T0} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $N = 100000$.\n   - Case C (high activity): $A = 1.5$, $B = 1.2$, $\\lambda_1 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $Q = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $p_{T0} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, $N = 100000$.\n6. Final output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the following order concatenated for Case A, then Case B, then Case C:\n   - For each case, output the six floats: $[r_{\\text{tot}}, z_{\\text{tot}}, r_{0}, z_{0}, r_1, r_2]$.\n   Thus, the final line must contain $18$ comma-separated numeric entries inside one pair of square brackets. All outputs are dimensionless.\n\nExpress all answers that involve physical quantities in the specified units. Angles are not used. Percentages must not be used; use decimal fractions where applicable.

The fundamental starting point is the correspondence between a non-homogeneous Poisson process with intensity $f(p_T)$ on an interval and its no-event probability given by the Sudakov form factor. Specifically, given an intensity $f(p_T)$ on $p_T \\in [p_{T0}, Q]$, the probability of no emissions above a scale $p_T$ is\n$$ \\Delta_f(p_T \\mid Q) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\int_{p_T}^Q f(t)\\, dt\\right), $$\nand the expected number of emissions per event is the integral\n$$ I = \\int_{p_{T0}}^Q f(t)\\, dt. $$\nThese are standard results for non-homogeneous Poisson processes and form the basis for the Sudakov representation used in parton-shower and Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI) simulations.\n\nIn the present setup, the total intensity is the sum of two channels,\n$$ f(p_T) = f_1(p_T) + f_2(p_T), \\quad f_1(p_T) = \\frac{A}{p_T + \\lambda_1}, \\quad f_2(p_T) = \\frac{B}{p_T + \\lambda_2}, $$\nwhere $A$, $B$, $\\lambda_1$, and $\\lambda_2$ are positive constants, and $p_T$, $\\lambda_1$, $\\lambda_2$, $Q$, $p_{T0}$ are in gigaelectronvolts (GeV). Direct integration yields\n$$ I_1 = \\int_{p_{T0}}^Q \\frac{A}{t + \\lambda_1}\\, dt = A \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{Q + \\lambda_1}{p_{T0} + \\lambda_1}\\right), \\quad\n   I_2 = \\int_{p_{T0}}^Q \\frac{B}{t + \\lambda_2}\\, dt = B \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{Q + \\lambda_2}{p_{T0} + \\lambda_2}\\right), $$\nand therefore\n$$ I = I_1 + I_2, \\quad \\Delta_f(p_{T0}\\mid Q) = e^{-I}. $$\n\nTo generate emission sequences ordered in $p_T$, we use the veto algorithm. The algorithm relies on constructing an overestimate $G(p_T)$ such that $G(p_T) \\ge f(p_T)$ for all $p_T$ in the relevant range, and such that the integral of $G(p_T)$ is analytically invertible to sample candidate points. We choose\n$$ G(p_T) = \\frac{A+B}{p_T + \\lambda_{\\min}}, \\quad \\lambda_{\\min} \\equiv \\min(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2). $$\nThis satisfies $G(p_T) \\ge f(p_T)$ because $p_T + \\lambda_{\\min} \\le p_T + \\lambda_i$ implies $\\frac{1}{p_T+\\lambda_i} \\le \\frac{1}{p_T+\\lambda_{\\min}}$ for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, hence\n$$ f_1(p_T) + f_2(p_T) = \\frac{A}{p_T+\\lambda_1} + \\frac{B}{p_T+\\lambda_2} \\le \\frac{A}{p_T+\\lambda_{\\min}} + \\frac{B}{p_T+\\lambda_{\\min}} = \\frac{A+B}{p_T+\\lambda_{\\min}} = G(p_T). $$\n\nThe integral of $G(p_T)$ between two ordered scales $p_T' < p_T$ is\n$$ \\int_{p_T'}^{p_T} G(t)\\, dt = (A+B) \\int_{p_T'}^{p_T} \\frac{dt}{t + \\lambda_{\\min}} = (A+B)\\, \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{p_T + \\lambda_{\\min}}{p_T' + \\lambda_{\\min}} \\right). $$\nIn a backward evolution from $p_T = Q$ to $p_{T0}$, the standard thinning method for non-homogeneous Poisson processes (Lewis-Shedler thinning) is equivalent to the Sudakov veto algorithm. Starting from a current scale $p$, we draw a uniform random variate $U \\in (0,1)$ and solve\n$$ \\exp\\!\\left( - \\int_{p'}^{p} G(t)\\, dt \\right) = U \\quad \\iff \\quad (A+B)\\, \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{p + \\lambda_{\\min}}{p' + \\lambda_{\\min}} \\right) = -\\ln U, $$\nwhich yields the next candidate scale\n$$ p' = \\left(p + \\lambda_{\\min}\\right)\\, U^{1/(A+B)} - \\lambda_{\\min}. $$\nIf $p' \\le p_{T0}$, the evolution stops. Otherwise, accept the candidate with probability\n$$ P_{\\text{acc}}(p') = \\frac{f(p')}{G(p')} = \\frac{\\frac{A}{p' + \\lambda_1} + \\frac{B}{p' + \\lambda_2}}{\\frac{A+B}{p' + \\lambda_{\\min}}} \\in (0,1]. $$\nIf accepted, record an emission at $p'$ and select the emitting channel by competition, with probability $P(\\text{ch}=1\\mid p') = f_1(p')/f(p')$ and $P(\\text{ch}=2\\mid p') = f_2(p')/f(p')$. Whether the candidate is accepted or vetoed, the evolution continues from the new current scale $p \\leftarrow p'$, enforcing strict $p_T$-ordering until $p \\le p_{T0}$.\n\nStatistical validation is based on well-tested properties of non-homogeneous Poisson processes: the total count per event is Poisson-distributed with mean $I$, so the sample mean $\\hat{\\mu}$ over $N$ events has standard deviation $\\sqrt{I/N}$; the zero-emission indicator is Bernoulli with mean $e^{-I}$, so the zero-emission fraction $\\hat{\\Delta}$ has standard deviation $\\sqrt{e^{-I}(1-e^{-I})/N}$.\n\nAlgorithmic design to compute required observables:\n1. For each test case, fix the random seed to ensure reproducibility. Initialize counters for the total number of accepted emissions $M$, channel-wise emissions $M_1$, $M_2$, and zero-emission events $Z$.\n2. For each of $N$ events, set $p \\leftarrow Q$ and repeatedly sample candidate scales $p'$ using the invertible cumulative of $G(p_T)$ as shown. If $p' \\le p_{T0}$, end the event. Otherwise compute $P_{\\text{acc}}(p')$, draw a uniform $V \\in (0,1)$, accept if $V < P_{\\text{acc}}(p')$, update counts, and select the emitting channel according to $f_i(p')/f(p')$. Set $p \\leftarrow p'$ and repeat.\n3. After $N$ events, compute $\\hat{\\mu} = M/N$, $\\hat{\\mu}_1 = M_1/N$, $\\hat{\\mu}_2 = M_2/N$, and $\\hat{\\Delta} = Z/N$. Compute analytics $I_1$, $I_2$, $I=I_1+I_2$, and $\\Delta = e^{-I}$, together with standard deviations $\\sigma_{\\text{tot}} = \\sqrt{I/N}$ and $\\sigma_0 = \\sqrt{\\Delta (1-\\Delta)/N}$. Form ratios $r_{\\text{tot}} = \\hat{\\mu}/I$, $r_1 = \\hat{\\mu}_1/I_1$, $r_2 = \\hat{\\mu}_2/I_2$, $r_0 = \\hat{\\Delta}/\\Delta$, and $z$-scores $z_{\\text{tot}} = (\\hat{\\mu}-I)/\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}$, $z_0 = (\\hat{\\Delta}-\\Delta)/\\sigma_0$.\n4. For numerical robustness, if a standard deviation happens to be zero due to extreme parameters (not the case in the provided suite), set the corresponding $z$-score to $0$ by convention.\n5. Output the results for the three cases concatenated into a single list in the required order $[r_{\\text{tot}}, z_{\\text{tot}}, r_0, z_0, r_1, r_2]$ for Case A, then Case B, then Case C, as a single line.\n\nThis procedure follows from the fundamental theory of non-homogeneous Poisson processes, the Sudakov form factor, and the thinning (veto) algorithm. The chosen $G(p_T)$ guarantees exactness of the sampling when combined with the acceptance probability $f/G$, and the interleaving of channels is realized by competition probabilities proportional to $f_i(p_T)$ at each accepted emission. The verification via ratios close to unity and $z$-scores of order one (within statistical fluctuations) demonstrates that the sampled $p_T$ spectrum reproduces the integrated analytic rate within statistical uncertainties.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef simulate_case(A, B, lam1, lam2, Q, pT0, N, rng):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulate N events of a pT-ordered interleaved sequence using a veto algorithm\n    with overestimate G(pT) = (A+B)/(pT + lam_min).
