In the continuum limit where the lattice spacing $a \\to 0$, the sum over lattice sites can be replaced by a spacetime integral according to the prescription $\\sum_{x} a^4 \\to \\int d^4x$. Applying this to the given lattice action, we obtain its continuum representation:\n$$\nS_{\\text{lat}} \\approx \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 \\frac{[\\Delta_{\\mu}\\phi(x)]^2}{a^2}\n$$\nThe discretization error arises from the difference between the discretized operator $\\frac{[\\Delta_{\\mu}\\phi(x)]^2}{a^2}$ and the continuum operator $(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x))^2$. To analyze this difference, we perform a Taylor series expansion of the forward difference operator $\\Delta_{\\mu}\\phi(x)$ for a smooth field $\\phi(x)$.\n\nThe Taylor expansion of $\\phi(x+a\\hat{\\mu})$ around the point $x$ in the $\\mu$-direction is:\n$$\n\\phi(x+a\\hat{\\mu}) = \\phi(x) + a\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x) + \\frac{a^2}{2!}\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x) + \\frac{a^3}{3!}\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi(x) + \\mathcal{O}(a^4)\n$$\nwhere $\\partial_\\mu^n \\phi(x)$ denotes the $n$-th partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^\\mu$.\n\nThe forward difference operator $\\Delta_{\\mu}\\phi(x)$ is then:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mu}\\phi(x) = \\phi(x+a\\hat{\\mu}) - \\phi(x) = a\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x) + \\frac{a^2}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x) + \\frac{a^3}{6}\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi(x) + \\mathcal{O}(a^4)\n$$\nNow, we can express the term appearing in the lattice action density:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mu}\\phi(x)}{a} = \\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x) + \\frac{a}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x) + \\frac{a^2}{6}\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi(x) + \\mathcal{O}(a^3)\n$$\nSquaring this expression, we collect terms up to order $a^2$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mu}\\phi(x)}{a}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x) + \\frac{a}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x) + \\frac{a^2}{6}\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi(x) + \\dots\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n= (\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x))^2 + 2(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x))\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x)\\right) + \\left[ \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x)\\right)^2 + 2(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x))\\left(\\frac{a^2}{6}\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi(x)\\right) \\right] + \\mathcal{O}(a^3)\n$$\n$$\n= (\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x))^2 + a(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x))(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x)) + a^2\\left[\\frac{1}{4}(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x))^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x))(\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi(x))\\right] + \\mathcal{O}(a^3)\n$$\nThe error in the action is the integral of the difference between the lattice and continuum integrands, summed over all directions $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\Delta S = S_{\\text{lat}} - S_{\\text{cont}} \\approx \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mu}\\phi(x)}{a}\\right)^2 - (\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi(x))^2 \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting our expansion, the integrand of the error is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(x) = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 \\left\\{ a(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi) + a^2\\left[\\frac{1}{4}(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi)\\right] + \\mathcal{O}(a^3) \\right\\}\n$$\nWe now analyze the integrated error $\\Delta S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{E}(x)$ order by order in $a$.\n\nThe $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ term is:\n$$\n\\Delta S^{(1)} = a \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 (\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)\n$$\nWe recognize the integrand for each $\\mu$ as a total derivative: $(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\left[(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)^2\\right]$. Thus:\n$$\n\\Delta S^{(1)} = \\frac{a}{2} \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 \\partial_{\\mu}\\left[(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)^2\\right]\n$$\nBy the divergence theorem and the assumption of periodic boundary conditions, the integral of a total derivative vanishes. Therefore, $\\Delta S^{(1)} = 0$. This is a common feature, although with a non-symmetric difference operator like the forward difference, this term only vanishes after integration.\n\nThe leading non-vanishing error is therefore of order $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$. The contribution is:\n$$\n\\Delta S^{(2)} = a^2 \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 \\left[\\frac{1}{4}(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi)\\right]\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we use integration by parts on the second term. For a fixed $\\mu$, and using periodic boundary conditions to drop the surface term:\n$$\n\\int d^4x \\, (\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}^3\\phi) = \\left[(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)\\right]_{\\text{boundary}} - \\int d^4x \\, (\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi) = -\\int d^4x \\, (\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)^2\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta S^{(2)}$:\n$$\n\\Delta S^{(2)} = a^2 \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 \\left[\\frac{1}{4}(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{3}(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)^2\\right]\n$$\n$$\n= a^2 \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)(\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)^2\n$$\n$$\n= a^2 \\left(\\frac{3-4}{12}\\right) \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 (\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi)^2\n$$\n$$\n= -\\frac{a^2}{12} \\int d^4x \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 (\\partial_{\\mu}^2\\phi(x))^2\n$$\nThis is the leading-order discretization error in the action, written as an integral over a local operator, as requested.

It is a standard problem in lattice gauge theory that requires the application of fundamental definitions. No flaws were detected during the validation process.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the plaquette operator $U_{12}(x)$ and its trace for a specific background gauge field in $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a $4$-dimensional Euclidean lattice. The background field is characterized by a constant Abelian field strength, with the only non-zero component being $F_{12}^{3}(x) = B$, where $B$ is a constant. All other components $F_{\\mu\\nu}^{a}(x)$ are zero.\n\nFirst, we must choose a suitable gauge potential $A_{\\mu}^{a}(x)$ that generates this field strength. The field strength tensor is given by $F_{\\mu\\nu}^{a} = \\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}^{a} - \\partial_{\\nu} A_{\\mu}^{a} - g f^{abc} A_{\\mu}^{b} A_{\\nu}^{c}$. Since the field is embedded along the $T^{3}$ direction, only components $A_{\\mu}^{3}(x)$ can be non-zero. This makes the non-Abelian term $- g f^{abc} A_{\\mu}^{b} A_{\\nu}^{c}$ vanish, as $f^{a3c}=0$ if $a=3$ or $c=3$. The expression simplifies to the Abelian form $F_{\\mu\\nu}^{3} = \\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}^{3} - \\partial_{\\nu} A_{\\mu}^{3}$. We need to find a potential such that $\\partial_{1} A_{2}^{3} - \\partial_{2} A_{1}^{3} = B$ and all other components of $F_{\\mu\\nu}^{a}$ are zero.\n\nThe problem also specifies that the chosen gauge should make the path-ordering $\\mathcal{P}$ on each link trivial. This occurs if the gauge potential $A_{\\mu}(z)$ is constant along the integration path of the link variable $U_{\\mu}(x)$, which is a straight line from $x$ to $x+a\\hat{\\mu}$. A convenient gauge choice that satisfies both conditions is the Landau-like gauge:\n$$\nA_{\\mu}^{a}(x) = \\delta^{a3} \\delta_{\\mu 2} B x_{1}\n$$\nWith this choice, $A_{1}^{a} = A_{3}^{a} = A_{4}^{a} = 0$ for all $a$, and $A_{2}^{a} = 0$ for $a \\neq 3$. The only non-zero component is $A_{2}^{3}(x) = B x_{1}$.\nLet's verify the field strength:\n$F_{12}^{3}(x) = \\partial_{1} A_{2}^{3}(x) - \\partial_{2} A_{1}^{3}(x) = \\partial_{1} (B x_{1}) - 0 = B$.\nAll other components $F_{\\mu\\nu}^{a}$ are manifestly zero.\nNow, let's verify the triviality of path-ordering for the links of the $U_{12}(x)$ plaquette. The link variable is $U_{\\mu}(y) = \\mathcal{P} \\exp(i g \\int_{y}^{y+a\\hat{\\mu}} A_{\\mu}^{c}(z) T^c dz)$. The path-ordering is trivial if $A_{\\mu}(z)$ is constant along the path.\nFor a link in the $\\mu$-direction starting at $y$, the path is $z(\\lambda) = y + \\lambda \\hat{\\mu}$ for $\\lambda \\in [0, a]$.\nFor links in the $\\hat{1}$-direction, the potential is $A_{1}^{a}(z) = 0$, which is constant. So path-ordering is trivial.\nFor links in the $\\hat{2}$-direction, the potential is $A_{2}^{3}(z) = B z_{1}$. Along a path in the $\\hat{2}$-direction starting at $y$, $z_1 = y_1$ is constant. Thus, $A_{2}^{3}(z)$ is constant along the path. Path-ordering is trivial.\nWith trivial path-ordering, the link variable simplifies to $U_{\\mu}(y) = \\exp(i g a A_{\\mu}(y))$, where $A_{\\mu}(y) = A_{\\mu}^{c}(y) T^{c}$.\n\nThe plaquette in the $12$-plane is defined as $U_{12}(x) \\equiv U_{1}(x) U_{2}(x+a\\hat{1}) U_{1}^{\\dagger}(x+a\\hat{2}) U_{2}^{\\dagger}(x)$. Let's compute each link variable:\n1.  $U_{1}(x)$: The potential is $A_{1}(x)=0$. Thus, $U_{1}(x) = \\exp(0) = \\mathbb{I}$, the identity matrix.\n2.  $U_{2}(x+a\\hat{1})$: The site is $y = x+a\\hat{1}$. The potential is $A_{2}^{a}(y) = \\delta^{a3} B y_{1} = \\delta^{a3} B (x_{1}+a)$. The link variable is $U_{2}(x+a\\hat{1}) = \\exp(i g a A_{2}^{c}(x+a\\hat{1}) T^{c}) = \\exp(i g a B (x_{1}+a) T^{3})$.\n3.  $U_{1}(x+a\\hat{2})$: The potential is $A_{1}(x+a\\hat{2})=0$. Thus, $U_{1}(x+a\\hat{2}) = \\mathbb{I}$, and its adjoint is $U_{1}^{\\dagger}(x+a\\hat{2}) = \\mathbb{I}$.\n4.  $U_{2}(x)$: The site is $x$. The potential is $A_{2}^{a}(x) = \\delta^{a3} B x_{1}$. The link variable is $U_{2}(x) = \\exp(i g a B x_{1} T^{3})$. Its adjoint is $U_{2}^{\\dagger}(x) = \\exp(-i g a B x_{1} T^{3})$, since $T^3$ is a Hermitian generator.\n\nNow, we multiply these matrices to form the plaquette:\n$$\nU_{12}(x) = \\mathbb{I} \\cdot \\exp(i g a B (x_{1}+a) T^{3}) \\cdot \\mathbb{I} \\cdot \\exp(-i g a B x_{1} T^{3})\n$$\nSince both exponential arguments are proportional to the same generator $T^3$, the matrices commute, and we can simply add the exponents:\n$$\nU_{12}(x) = \\exp\\left(i g a B (x_{1}+a) T^{3} - i g a B x_{1} T^{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nU_{12}(x) = \\exp\\left(i g a B (x_{1}+a-x_{1}) T^{3}\\right) = \\exp\\left(i g a^{2} B T^{3}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $B = F_{12}^{3}$, we get:\n$$\nU_{12}(x) = \\exp\\left(i g a^{2} F_{12}^{3} T^{3}\\right)\n$$\nThis result is independent of the position $x$, as expected for a constant field strength. This result exactly matches the form $U_{\\mu\\nu}(x) = \\exp(i a^2 g F_{\\mu\\nu}^a T^a)$, which is the expected leading-order behavior in the continuum limit $a \\to 0$. Here, the relation is exact due to the simple nature of the field configuration and the chosen gauge. This confirms the consistency of the lattice formulation and the normalization of the field strength tensor.\n\nThe final task is to compute the trace of this plaquette, $\\operatorname{Tr}[U_{12}(x)]$. The gauge group is $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the generators $T^a$ are in the fundamental ($2$-dimensional) representation. The normalization is specified as $\\operatorname{Tr}(T^a T^b) = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{ab}$.

Applying the derivative to the Fourier representation of $\\psi(x)$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mu} \\psi(x) = \\int \\frac{d^{4} p}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\frac{\\exp(i p \\cdot (x+a\\hat{\\mu})) - \\exp(i p \\cdot (x-a\\hat{\\mu}))}{2a} \\tilde{\\psi}(p)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\exp(i p \\cdot x)$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mu} \\psi(x) = \\int \\frac{d^{4} p}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\exp(i p \\cdot x) \\left( \\frac{\\exp(i p_{\\mu} a) - \\exp(-i p_{\\mu} a)}{2a} \\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(p)\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp(i\\theta) - \\exp(-i\\theta)}{2i}$, we get:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mu} \\psi(x) = \\int \\frac{d^{4} p}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\exp(i p \\cdot x) \\left( \\frac{i \\sin(a p_{\\mu})}{a} \\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(p)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the Fourier representations of $\\bar{\\psi}(x)$ and $\\nabla_{\\mu}\\psi(x)$ into the action:\n$$\nS = a^{4} \\sum_{x} \\left( \\int \\frac{d^{4} q}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\exp(-i q \\cdot x) \\tilde{\\bar{\\psi}}(q) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\gamma_{\\mu} \\int \\frac{d^{4} p}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\exp(i p \\cdot x) \\frac{i \\sin(a p_{\\mu})}{a} \\tilde{\\psi}(p) \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms and integrals:\n$$\nS = \\int \\frac{d^{4} p}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\int \\frac{d^{4} q}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\tilde{\\bar{\\psi}}(q) \\left( \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\gamma_{\\mu} \\frac{i \\sin(a p_{\\mu})}{a} \\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(p) \\left( a^{4} \\sum_{x} \\exp(i(p-q) \\cdot x) \\right)\n$$\nThe sum over all lattice sites $x$ provides a representation of the Dirac delta function on the lattice:\n$$\na^{4} \\sum_{x} \\exp(i(p-q) \\cdot x) = (2\\pi)^{4} \\delta^{(4)}(p-q)\n$$\nfor momenta $p, q$ within the first Brillouin zone. Substituting this into the expression for the action:\n$$\nS = \\int \\frac{d^{4} p}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\int \\frac{d^{4} q}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\tilde{\\bar{\\psi}}(q) \\left( \\sum_{\\mu} \\frac{i \\gamma_{\\mu}}{a} \\sin(a p_{\\mu}) \\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(p) (2\\pi)^{4} \\delta^{(4)}(p-q)\n$$\nIntegrating over $q$ using the delta function, we obtain the action in momentum space:\n$$\nS = \\int \\frac{d^{4} p}{(2 \\pi)^{4}} \\tilde{\\bar{\\psi}}(p) \\left( \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\frac{i \\gamma_{\\mu}}{a} \\sin(a p_{\\mu}) \\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(p)\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition of $D_{\\text{naive}}(p)$, we identify the naive Dirac operator in momentum space:\n$$\nD_{\\text{naive}}(p) = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\frac{i \\gamma_{\\mu}}{a} \\sin(a p_{\\mu})\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the momenta at which this operator vanishes. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_{\\mu}$ are linearly independent, $D_{\\text{naive}}(p)=0$ if and only if the coefficient of each $\\gamma_{\\mu}$ is zero for all $\\mu \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{a} \\sin(a p_{\\mu}) = 0 \\quad \\forall \\mu\n$$\nWithin the first Brillouin zone, $p_{\\mu} \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$, the condition $\\sin(a p_{\\mu})=0$ implies $a p_{\\mu} \\in \\{-\\pi, 0, \\pi\\}$. Since momenta are defined up to shifts of $2\\pi/a$, the points $p_{\\mu}=-\\pi/a$ and $p_{\\mu}=\\pi/a$ are identified. Thus, the distinct solutions are $p_{\\mu}=0$ and $p_{\\mu}=\\pi/a$. The set of momenta where $D_{\\text{naive}}(p)$ vanishes is therefore given by:\n$$\np_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\eta_{\\mu}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\eta_{\\mu} \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\quad \\text{for each } \\mu=1,2,3,4.\n$$\nThis constitutes $2^4 = 16$ points, which are the corners of the $4$-dimensional Brillouin zone. These correspond to $1$ physical fermion and $15$ unphysical \"doubler\" fermions.\n\nWe now analyze the behavior of the theory at low energies, which corresponds to small momentum fluctuations around these zeros. We parameterize the momentum $p_{\\mu}$ near a generic corner specified by the vector $\\eta = (\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\eta_3, \\eta_4)$ as:\n$$\np_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\eta_{\\mu} + k_{\\mu}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad |a k_{\\mu}| \\ll 1\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D_{\\text{naive}}(p)$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{naive}}(p) = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\frac{i \\gamma_{\\mu}}{a} \\sin\\left(a \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{a} \\eta_{\\mu} + k_{\\mu}\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\frac{i \\gamma_{\\mu}}{a} \\sin(\\pi \\eta_{\\mu} + a k_{\\mu})\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(n\\pi + x) = (-1)^n \\sin(x)$ for integer $n$, and since $\\eta_{\\mu} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, we have:\n$$\n\\sin(\\pi \\eta_{\\mu} + a k_{\\mu}) = (-1)^{\\eta_{\\mu}} \\sin(a k_{\\mu})\n$$\nFor small momenta, $|a k_{\\mu}| \\ll 1$, we can expand the sine function to leading order: $\\sin(a k_{\\mu}) \\approx a k_{\\mu}$.\nThe Dirac operator becomes:\n$$\nD_{\\text{naive}}(p) \\approx \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\frac{i \\gamma_{\\mu}}{a} (-1)^{\\eta_{\\mu}} (a k_{\\mu}) = i \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} (-1)^{\\eta_{\\mu}} \\gamma_{\\mu} k_{\\mu}\n$$\nThis is the effective continuum Dirac operator $D_{\\text{eff}}^{(\\eta)}(k)$ that governs the low-energy dynamics near the corner $\\eta$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{eff}}^{(\\eta)}(k) = i \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} (-1)^{\\eta_{\\mu}} \\gamma_{\\mu} k_{\\mu}\n$$\nThe standard continuum Dirac operator has the form $i \\sum_{\\mu} \\gamma_{\\mu} k_{\\mu}$. By comparing this to our effective operator, we can define a set of effective gamma matrices $\\gamma_{\\mu}^{(\\eta)}$ for each corner $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mu}^{(\\eta)} = (-1)^{\\eta_{\\mu}} \\gamma_{\\mu}\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the chirality of each doubler fermion. The effective chirality matrix $\\gamma_{5}^{(\\eta)}$ is defined by the product of the effective gamma matrices:\n$$\n\\gamma_{5}^{(\\eta)} \\equiv \\gamma_{1}^{(\\eta)} \\gamma_{2}^{(\\eta)} \\gamma_{3}^{(\\eta)} \\gamma_{4}^{(\\eta)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\gamma_{\\mu}^{(\\eta)}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{5}^{(\\eta)} = ((-1)^{\\eta_{1}}\\gamma_{1}) ((-1)^{\\eta_{2}}\\gamma_{2}) ((-1)^{\\eta_{3}}\\gamma_{3}) ((-1)^{\\eta_{4}}\\gamma_{4})\n$$\nSince the sign factors $(-1)^{\\eta_{\\mu}}$ are scalars, they commute with the gamma matrices and can be grouped together:\n$$\n\\gamma_{5}^{(\\eta)} = (-1)^{\\eta_{1}} (-1)^{\\eta_{2}} (-1)^{\\eta_{3}} (-1)^{\\eta_{4}} (\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4})\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{5}^{(\\eta)} = (-1)^{\\eta_{1}+\\eta_{2}+\\eta_{3}+\\eta_{4}} \\gamma_{5}\n$$\nwhere we used the definition $\\gamma_{5} \\equiv \\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}$. We are asked to write this as $\\gamma_{5}^{(\\eta)} = s(\\eta) \\gamma_{5}$, which allows us to identify the chirality sign $s(\\eta)$ as:\n$$\ns(\\eta) = (-1)^{\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\eta_{\\mu}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the $16$ low-energy fermion species do not all have the same chirality. Specifically, there are 8 species with $s(\\eta)=+1$ and 8 species with $s(\\eta)=-1$, which is a manifestation of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem.\n\nThe two expressions required for the final answer are the effective Dirac operator $D_{\\text{eff}}^{(\\eta)}(k)$ and the chirality sign $s(\\eta)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ni \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} (-1)^{\\eta_{\\mu}} \\gamma_{\\mu} k_{\\mu}  (-1)^{\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} \\eta_{\\mu}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3519997"}]}
