A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**1. Kolmogorov’s Criterion and Detailed Balance**\n\nA stationary Markov process satisfies the condition of detailed balance if, for every pair of states $i$ and $j$, the steady-state flux from $i$ to $j$ equals the flux from $j$ to $i$. This is expressed as:\n$$\nk_{ij}\\pi_i = k_{ji}\\pi_j\n$$\nKolmogorov’s criterion for detailed balance states that a system is in detailed balance if and only if for any closed loop of states $i_1 \\to i_2 \\to \\dots \\to i_n \\to i_1$, the product of the forward transition rates equals the product of the reverse transition rates:\n$$\n\\prod_{k=1}^{n} k_{i_k i_{k+1}} = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} k_{i_{k+1} i_k}\n$$\nwhere $i_{n+1} = i_1$.\n\nIn this problem, the network consists of a single cycle $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$. We apply Kolmogorov's criterion to this cycle.\nThe product of clockwise (forward) rates is:\n$$\nk_{12} k_{23} k_{31} = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\n$$\nThe product of counter-clockwise (reverse) rates is:\n$$\nk_{21} k_{32} k_{13} = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1\n$$\nSince $64 \\neq 1$, the condition for detailed balance is violated. The system is in a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) sustained by a net cyclic probability flux.\n\n**2. Stationary Distribution $\\{\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3\\}$**\n\nAt steady state, the probability distribution $\\vec{\\pi} = (\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3)^T$ is constant, meaning $\\frac{d\\pi_i}{dt}=0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The master equation for the steady state is $\\mathbf{Q}\\vec{\\pi} = \\vec{0}$, where $\\mathbf{Q}$ is the transition rate matrix. This yields a system of linear equations representing the balance of probability flow into and out of each state:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d\\pi_1}{dt} &= k_{21}\\pi_2 + k_{31}\\pi_3 - (k_{12}+k_{13})\\pi_1 = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{d\\pi_2}{dt} &= k_{12}\\pi_1 + k_{32}\\pi_3 - (k_{21}+k_{23})\\pi_2 = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{d\\pi_3}{dt} &= k_{13}\\pi_1 + k_{23}\\pi_2 - (k_{31}+k_{32})\\pi_3 = 0\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting the given rates:\n\\begin{align*}\n1 \\cdot \\pi_2 + 4 \\cdot \\pi_3 - (4+1)\\pi_1 &= 0 \\implies \\pi_2 + 4\\pi_3 - 5\\pi_1 = 0 \\\\\n4 \\cdot \\pi_1 + 1 \\cdot \\pi_3 - (1+4)\\pi_2 &= 0 \\implies 4\\pi_1 + \\pi_3 - 5\\pi_2 = 0 \\\\\n1 \\cdot \\pi_1 + 4 \\cdot \\pi_2 - (4+1)\\pi_3 &= 0 \\implies \\pi_1 + 4\\pi_2 - 5\\pi_3 = 0\n\\end{align*}\nThis system of equations must be solved along with the normalization condition:\n$$\n\\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we express $\\pi_3$ as $\\pi_3 = 5\\pi_2 - 4\\pi_1$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\n\\pi_2 + 4(5\\pi_2 - 4\\pi_1) - 5\\pi_1 = 0 \\implies \\pi_2 + 20\\pi_2 - 16\\pi_1 - 5\\pi_1 = 0 \\implies 21\\pi_2 - 21\\pi_1 = 0 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2\n$$\nSince $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2$, the relation $\\pi_3 = 5\\pi_2 - 4\\pi_1$ simplifies to $\\pi_3 = 5\\pi_1 - 4\\pi_1 = \\pi_1$.\nThus, we find that $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$. Using the normalization condition:\n$$\n\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1 \\implies 3\\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nTherefore, the stationary distribution is uniform:\n$$\n\\pi_1 = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad \\pi_2 = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad \\pi_3 = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThis result is expected, as the transition rate matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ is a circulant matrix, which has a uniform stationary distribution.\n\n**3. Steady-State Probability Currents $J_{ij}$**\n\nThe net probability current from state $i$ to state $j$ at steady state is defined as:\n$$\nJ_{ij} = k_{ij}\\pi_i - k_{ji}\\pi_j\n$$\nWe calculate the currents for the edges in the cycle:\n$$\nJ_{12} = k_{12}\\pi_1 - k_{21}\\pi_2 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} - 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{23} = k_{23}\\pi_2 - k_{32}\\pi_3 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} - 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{31} = k_{31}\\pi_3 - k_{13}\\pi_1 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} - 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe currents are equal along the cycle, $J_{12} = J_{23} = J_{31} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, indicating a constant net probability flux of $J_{\\text{cycle}} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in the clockwise direction $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$.\n\n**4. Total Steady-State Entropy Production Rate $\\dot S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$**\n\nThe total entropy production rate for a system described by a Markov jump process can be calculated by summing the contributions from each fundamental cycle. In this case, there is only one cycle. The formula is:\n$$\n\\dot S_{\\mathrm{tot}} = J_{\\text{cycle}} \\mathcal{A}_{\\text{cycle}}\n$$\nwhere $J_{\\text{cycle}}$ is the net cycle current and $\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{cycle}}$ is the thermodynamic affinity of the cycle. The affinity is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{cycle}} = k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\prod_{\\text{clockwise}} k_{ij}}{\\prod_{\\text{counter-clockwise}} k_{ji}}\\right)\n$$\nFor the cycle $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{cycle}} = k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{12}k_{23}k_{31}}{k_{21}k_{32}k_{13}}\\right)\n$$\nThe entropy production rate in units of $k_B$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot S_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{k_B} = J_{\\text{cycle}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{12}k_{23}k_{31}}{k_{21}k_{32}k_{13}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the known values for the current and rates:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot S_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{k_B} = (1 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{4 \\times 4 \\times 4}{1 \\times 1 \\times 1}\\right) = \\ln(64) \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nTo obtain the required numerical value, we compute the natural logarithm of $64$:\n$$\n\\ln(64) \\approx 4.158883083...\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot S_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{k_B} \\approx 4.159 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.159}$$", "id": "3305766"}, {"introduction": "In realistic biological experiments, our view of a system is often incomplete, with some molecular states or pathways being unobservable.

The goal is to compute and compare two measures of entropy production: one for the full system and one for an observer restricted to a subsystem.\n\nFirst, we determine the steady-state probabilities $p_A$, $p_B$, and $p_C$. The rate matrix $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ for the system is constructed from the given rate constants $k_{ij}$ (in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$): $k_{AB} = 8$, $k_{BA} = 3$, $k_{BC} = 6$, $k_{CB} = 2$, $k_{CA} = 5$, and $k_{AC} = 1$.

True Steady-State Entropy Production Rate ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{true}}$)**\nThe total entropy production rate for a Markov jump process in NESS is the sum of contributions from each transition pair.

This calculation is based on the \"measured steady-state flows for that edge\", which are given as $r_{AB}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$ and $r_{BA}^{\\mathrm{meas}}$.

The apparent entropy production is constructed from the apparent current $J_{\\mathrm{app}}$ and apparent force $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{app}}$ for the observed edge:\nThe apparent current is the net flow: $J_{\\mathrm{app}} = r_{AB}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - r_{BA}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{204}{83} - \\frac{87}{83} = \\frac{117}{83} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is identical to the cycle current $J$.\nThe apparent force is the logarithm of the ratio of the one-way flows:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{AB}^{\\mathrm{meas}}}{r_{BA}^{\\mathrm{meas}}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{AB}p_A}{k_{BA}p_B}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{204/83}{87/83}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{204}{87}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{68}{29}\\right)\n$$\nThe apparent entropy production rate is the product of these two quantities:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}} = J_{\\mathrm{app}} \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{117}{83} \\ln\\left(\\frac{68}{29}\\right) \\ k_{B}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis quantity represents the contribution to the total entropy production from the single edge $A \\leftrightarrow B$.\n\n**3.

Since $J([S])$ is a positive, monotonically increasing function of $[S]$, the term $r_0/J([S])$ is a monotonically decreasing function (for $r_0 > 0$). Therefore, $d([S])$ decreases as $[S]$ increases. As $[S] \\to \\infty$, $J([S]) \\to V_{\\max}$, and $d([S])$ approaches the constant plateau $\\frac{\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{T} (1 + r_0/V_{\\max})$. The reasoning provided is also correct. **Statement A is correct.**\n\n*   **B:** This statement claims $d([S])$ always increases with $[S]$. This contradicts our finding. **Statement B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C:** This statement claims $\\Sigma([S])$ is maximal at intermediate $[S]$ and then decreases. This contradicts our finding that $\\Sigma([S])$ increases monotonically. Saturation leads to the *maximum*, not minimum, entropy production rate. **Statement C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D:** This statement considers the special case where futile cycling is absent ($r_0 = 0$). In this case, our formula for $d([S])$ becomes:\n    $$ d([S]) = \\frac{\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{T} (1 + 0) = \\frac{\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}{T} $$\n    This is a constant, independent of the substrate concentration $[S]$. This means that if every ATP hydrolysis event produces one product molecule, the dissipation per product is fixed. **Statement D is correct.**\n\nBoth statements A and D are correct deductions from the model's behavior under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3305744"}]}
