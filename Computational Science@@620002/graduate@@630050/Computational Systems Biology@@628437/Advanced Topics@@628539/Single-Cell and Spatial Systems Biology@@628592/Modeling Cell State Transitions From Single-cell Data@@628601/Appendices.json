A crucial part of this process is rigorously evaluating the model's predictive power.

Each cell is assigned to one of $K=3$ transcriptional states based on clustering of gene expression profiles, producing state-count vectors $\\mathbf{c}^{(m)} = (c_{1}^{(m)}, c_{2}^{(m)}, c_{3}^{(m)})$ at time $t_{m}$ for $m \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$, with a total of $N_{m} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_{i}^{(m)}$ cells observed at time $t_{m}$. Assume cells within a time point are independent draws from a categorical distribution over the $3$ states. To model cell state transitions, assume a time-homogeneous, discrete-time Markov chain with a single-step transition matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ between successive unit-hour times, and let $\\mathbf{p}(t)$ denote the population-level state probability vector at time $t$. The model predicts $\\mathbf{p}(t_{m})$ from $\\mathbf{p}(t_{0})$ and $\\mathbf{P}$ by forward propagation across unit steps.\n\nYou will design a Leave-One-Time-Point-Out Cross-Validation (LOTO-CV) protocol to evaluate predictive performance of the transition model and derive a log-likelihood-based scoring metric for a held-out time point.

The observed counts at $t_{2}$ are $\\mathbf{c}^{(2)} = (52, 29, 19)$, so $N_{2} = 100$, and the trained model’s predicted probabilities at $t_{2}$ are $\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}(t_{2}) = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2)$.\n\nStarting from the definitions of the categorical distribution for independent samples and the principle of maximum likelihood for model assessment, derive a suitable log-likelihood-based scoring metric for the held-out time point that is appropriate for comparing models across folds where $N_{m}$ may differ. Then, for this fold, compute the numerical value of this metric using the provided $\\mathbf{c}^{(2)}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}(t_{2})$.

Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of a log-likelihood-based scoring metric for a held-out time point in a cross-validation setting and its subsequent calculation. The metric must be suitable for comparing models across folds with potentially different sample sizes ($N_m$).\n\nFirst, we derive the scoring metric. The problem states that the cells observed at a given time point $t_m$ are considered $N_m$ independent draws from a categorical distribution over $K=3$ states. The parameters of this distribution are the state probabilities $\\mathbf{p}^{(m)} = (p_1^{(m)}, p_2^{(m)}, p_3^{(m)})$. A trained model provides a prediction for these probabilities, denoted as $\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(m)} = (\\widehat{p}_1^{(m)}, \\widehat{p}_2^{(m)}, \\widehat{p}_3^{(m)})$.\n\nLet the observed data at the held-out time point $t_m$ be the cell counts in each state, $\\mathbf{c}^{(m)} = (c_1^{(m)}, c_2^{(m)}, c_3^{(m)})$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_i^{(m)} = N_m$. According to the assumption of independent draws from a categorical distribution, the likelihood of observing this specific set of $N_m$ cell states, given the model's predicted probabilities $\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(m)}$, is the product of the probabilities for each individual cell observation. This product can be grouped by state, resulting in the following likelihood function, $L$:\n$$L(\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(m)}; \\mathbf{c}^{(m)}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} (\\widehat{p}_i^{(m)})^{c_i^{(m)}}$$\nThis expression gives the probability of the observed data under the model's predictions. The log-likelihood, $\\mathcal{L}$, is the natural logarithm of this function:\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(m)}; \\mathbf{c}^{(m)}) = \\ln(L) = \\ln\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{3} (\\widehat{p}_i^{(m)})^{c_i^{(m)}}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_i^{(m)} \\ln(\\widehat{p}_i^{(m)})$$\nThis log-likelihood is the appropriate measure of how well the model's predicted probabilities $\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(m)}$ explain the observed counts $\\mathbf{c}^{(m)}$. A higher log-likelihood indicates a better fit.\n\nNote that if we had modeled the counts $\\mathbf{c}^{(m)}$ as a single draw from a multinomial distribution, the log-likelihood would include an additional combinatorial term, $\\ln(N_m!) - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\ln(c_i^{(m)}!)$. However, this term depends only on the observed data, not on the model's parameters $\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(m)}$. Therefore, for the purpose of comparing different models on the same dataset, this term is an irrelevant additive constant and is conventionally omitted. The formulation based on independent categorical draws directly yields the kernel of the log-likelihood that is relevant for model evaluation.\n\nThe problem requires a metric suitable for comparing models across different cross-validation folds, where the number of cells $N_m$ at the held-out time point $t_m$ might differ. The total log-likelihood $\\mathcal{L}$ is an extensive quantity that scales with $N_m$. To obtain an intensive quantity that is comparable across folds, we must normalize by the number of observations. The standard approach is to calculate the average log-likelihood per cell. This leads to the scoring metric $S_m$:\n$$S_m = \\frac{1}{N_m} \\mathcal{L}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}^{(m)}; \\mathbf{c}^{(m)}) = \\frac{1}{N_m} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_i^{(m)} \\ln(\\widehat{p}_i^{(m)})$$\nThis metric is expressed in \"nats per cell,\" as the natural logarithm is used. It represents the average contribution of each cell to the total log-likelihood.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of this metric for the specified fold where time point $t_2$ is held out.\nThe given data for this fold are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Observed counts: $\\mathbf{c}^{(2)} = (52, 29, 19)$\n    \\item Predicted probabilities from the trained model: $\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}(t_2) = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2)$\n\\end{itemize}\nFirst, we calculate the total number of cells at $t_2$:\n$$N_2 = c_1^{(2)} + c_2^{(2)} + c_3^{(2)} = 52 + 29 + 19 = 100$$\nNow, we apply the derived formula for the scoring metric $S_2$:\n$$S_2 = \\frac{1}{N_2} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_i^{(2)} \\ln(\\widehat{p}_i(t_2))$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$S_2 = \\frac{1}{100} \\left[ 52 \\ln(0.5) + 29 \\ln(0.3) + 19 \\ln(0.2) \\right]$$\nWe compute the terms inside the bracket:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $52 \\ln(0.5) \\approx 52 \\times (-0.693147) \\approx -36.043644$\n    \\item $29 \\ln(0.3) \\approx 29 \\times (-1.203973) \\approx -34.915217$\n    \\item $19 \\ln(0.2) \\approx 19 \\times (-1.609438) \\approx -30.579322$\n\\end{itemize}\nSumming these values gives the total log-likelihood:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_i^{(2)} \\ln(\\widehat{p}_i(t_2)) \\approx -36.043644 - 34.915217 - 30.579322 = -101.538183$$\nFinally, we divide by $N_2 = 100$ to get the score in nats per cell:\n$$S_2 = \\frac{-101.538183}{100} = -1.01538183$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

We are given zero-flux boundary conditions, $J(0,t) = J(1,t) = 0$.\n\nTo discretize this equation, we use the finite volume method. We divide the domain $[0,1]$ into $N$ uniform cells, or control volumes, $C_i = [x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}]$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$. The center of cell $C_i$ is $x_i$, and its width is $\\Delta x = 1/N$. The faces of the cell are at $x_{i-1/2}$ and $x_{i+1/2}$.\n\nIntegrating the PDE over the control volume $C_i$ and applying the divergence theorem yields a semi-discrete equation for the average density $\\rho_i(t)$ in cell $i$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\rho_i}{dt} = - \\frac{J_{i+1/2} - J_{i-1/2}}{\\Delta x} + g_i \\rho_i $$\nwhere $J_{i \\pm 1/2}$ are the total fluxes at the cell faces, and we use the notation $g_i = g(x_i)$ and $\\rho_i = \\rho(x_i, t)$.\n\nWe discretize the total flux $J_{i+1/2} = (b\\rho)_{i+1/2} - (D\\nabla\\rho)_{i+1/2}$ at the cell face.\nThe advective flux $(b\\rho)_{i+1/2}$ is handled with a first-order upwind scheme for stability.

From the PDE, this should equal $g_i \\rho_i$.\nLet $Y_{2,i} = g_{\\text{clonal}, i}$.

This results in the normal equations, a $2 \\times 2$ linear system for the parameter vector $\\mathbf{a} = [a_0, a_1]^T$: $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{v}$, where:\n$$ \\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\rho_i^2+1) & \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\rho_i^2+1)s_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\rho_i^2+1)s_i & \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\rho_i^2+1)s_i^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\rho_i Y_{1,i} + Y_{2,i}) \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^N s_i (\\rho_i Y_{1,i} + Y_{2,i}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSolving this system gives the estimated parameters $a_0$ and $a_1$.\n\n### Part 4: Implementation and Synthetic Data\nThe implementation follows the steps outlined. Synthetic data for $\\rho(x, \\tau)$ is generated by applying a single explicit forward Euler time step to the initial density $\\rho(x, 0)$ using the derived finite-volume scheme and the known ground truth $g_{\\text{true}}(x)$. The clonal fold changes $m(x)$ are generated directly from $g_{\\text{true}}(x)$. These synthetic data are then used with the derived estimators to find $a_0$ and $a_1$ and compute the estimated $\\hat{g}(x) = \\hat{a}_0 + \\hat{a}_1 s(x)$.

Quantify the concordance between $c$ and a provided cell-cycle score vector $s \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by the Pearson correlation coefficient\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{curl}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (c_{i}-\\bar{c})(s_{i}-\\bar{s})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (c_{i}-\\bar{c})^{2}} \\, \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (s_{i}-\\bar{s})^{2}}}.\n$$\n\nFor numerical stability, if any standard deviation in the denominator is exactly zero, define the corresponding correlation as $0$.\n\nFor each test case below, compute and report:\n- The fraction of energy in each component,\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{grad}} = \\frac{\\lVert y_{\\mathrm{grad}} \\rVert_{2}^{2}}{\\lVert y \\rVert_{2}^{2}}, \\quad f_{\\mathrm{curl}} = \\frac{\\lVert y_{\\mathrm{curl}} \\rVert_{2}^{2}}{\\lVert y \\rVert_{2}^{2}}, \\quad f_{\\mathrm{harm}} = \\frac{\\lVert y_{\\mathrm{harm}} \\rVert_{2}^{2}}{\\lVert y \\rVert_{2}^{2}},\n$$\nwith the convention that if $\\lVert y \\rVert_{2}=0$ then set all three fractions to $0$.\n- The correlation metrics $r_{\\mathrm{grad}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{curl}}$ as defined above.\n\nYou must implement the following from first principles of linear algebra:\n- Construct $B$ from the oriented edges as defined.\n- Identify all triangles by enumerating all $3$-cliques in the undirected graph, then construct $D_{1}$ using the boundary orientation rule $\\partial (i,j,k) = (i,j) + (j,k) - (i,k)$ with $i<j<k$.\n- Compute $y_{\\mathrm{grad}}$ as the orthogonal projection of $y$ onto $\\mathrm{col}(B)$ by least squares.

That is, find $\\alpha$ minimizing $\\lVert D_{1} \\alpha - y \\rVert_{2}^{2}$ and set $y_{\\mathrm{curl}} = D_{1} \\alpha$. If there are no triangles (i.e., $t=0$ so $D_{1}$ has zero columns), define $y_{\\mathrm{curl}}=0$.\n- Compute $y_{\\mathrm{harm}} = y - y_{\\mathrm{grad}} - y_{\\mathrm{curl}}$.\n\nTest suite. For each test, the node set is $\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$, edges are undirected but oriented by the rule $i<j$ for edge $(i\\to j)$, and the pseudotime $p$ and cell-cycle score $s$ are given per node. The edge flow $y$ is specified either by composing gradient and curl generators or directly per edge as noted.\n\n- Test $1$ (mixed gradient and curl on a triangle-with-branch graph):\n  - Nodes: $n=6$.\n  - Edges: $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(0,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,5)$.\n  - Gradient potential: $\\phi = [0.00, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00]$.\n  - Triangle amplitudes (per triangle tuple): $\\alpha\\{(0,1,2)\\} = 1.00$.\n  - Curl mixing coefficient: $\\gamma = 0.50$.\n  - Edge flow construction: $y = B \\phi + \\gamma \\, D_{1} \\alpha$.\n  - Pseudotime: $p = [0.00, 0.22, 0.39, 0.62, 0.81, 0.98]$.\n  - Cell-cycle score: $s = [1.00, 0.90, 0.80, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05]$.\n\n- Test $2$ (pure gradient on the same graph):\n  - Nodes: $n=6$.\n  - Edges: $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(0,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,5)$.\n  - Gradient potential: $\\phi = [0.00, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00]$.\n  - Triangle amplitudes: $\\alpha\\{(0,1,2)\\} = 0.00$.\n  - Edge flow construction: $y = B \\phi$.\n  - Pseudotime: $p = [0.00, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00]$.\n  - Cell-cycle score: $s = [0.30, 0.50, 0.40, 0.60, 0.70, 0.20]$.\n\n- Test $3$ (pure curl on a two-triangle complex):\n  - Nodes: $n=4$.\n  - Edges: $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(0,3)$, $(0,2)$.\n  - Triangle amplitudes: $\\alpha\\{(0,1,2)\\} = 1.00$, $\\alpha\\{(0,2,3)\\} = 0.20$.\n  - Gradient potential: $\\phi = [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00]$.\n  - Edge flow construction: $y = D_{1} \\alpha$.\n  - Pseudotime: $p = [0.10, 0.40, 0.20, 0.30]$.\n  - Cell-cycle score: $s = [1.00, 0.95, 0.90, 0.60]$.\n\n- Test $4$ (harmonic cycle on a $4$-cycle with no triangles):\n  - Nodes: $n=4$.\n  - Edges: $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(0,3)$.\n  - Edge flow specified directly to represent a unit circulation following $0 \\to 1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 0$:\n    - $y(0,1) = 1.00$, $y(1,2) = 1.00$, $y(2,3) = 1.00$, $y(0,3) = -1.00$.\n  - Pseudotime: $p = [0.00, 0.30, 0.60, 0.90]$.\n  - Cell-cycle score: $s = [0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20]$.\n\nOutput requirements.\n- For each test, compute $[f_{\\mathrm{grad}}, f_{\\mathrm{curl}}, f_{\\mathrm{harm}}, r_{\\mathrm{grad}}, r_{\\mathrm{curl}}]$.\n- Round each value to exactly $4$ decimal places using standard rounding to nearest, with halfway cases rounded to the nearest even representable float.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of lists enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the tests $1$ through $4$.

All numerical answers are unitless floats.", "solution": "The problem requires the decomposition of a given edge flow vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ on a graph into three orthogonal components: a gradient component $y_{\\mathrm{grad}}$, a curl component $y_{\\mathrm{curl}}$, and a harmonic component $y_{\\mathrm{harm}}$. This decomposition is known as the discrete Hodge decomposition. The procedure and subsequent analyses will be derived from first principles of linear algebra as specified.\n\nThe graph has $n$ vertices (nodes) and $m$ edges. By convention, each undirected edge is assigned an orientation from the lower-indexed node to the higher-indexed node.\n\n**1. Matrix Representations**\n\nThe relationships between nodes, edges, and triangles (3-cliques) are captured by two incidence matrices, $B$ and $D_1$.\n\nThe **oriented incidence matrix**, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, maps node-based potentials to gradient flows on edges. For an edge $e_k$ oriented from node $i$ to node $j$ (with $i<j$), its corresponding row in $B$ has $B_{k,i} = -1$ and $B_{k,j} = +1$, with all other entries being zero. The column space of $B$, $\\mathrm{col}(B)$, is the space of all gradient flows. An edge flow $v$ is a gradient flow if it can be written as $v = B\\phi$ for some potential vector $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nThe **edge-to-triangle incidence matrix**, $D_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times t}$, where $t$ is the number of triangles, represents elementary curl flows supported on each triangle. For a triangle $(i,j,k)$ with $i<j<k$, the problem defines a boundary orientation $\\partial(i,j,k) = (i,j) + (j,k) - (i,k)$, which corresponds to the cycle $i \\to j \\to k \\to i$. The corresponding column of $D_1$ is a vector representing this cycle flow in the basis of oriented edges. This vector has:\n- A $+1$ for edge $(i,j)$ (since its orientation matches the cycle).\n- A $+1$ for edge $(j,k)$ (since its orientation matches the cycle).\n- A $-1$ for edge $(i,k)$ (since its orientation is opposite to the cycle's required $k \\to i$ path).\nThe column space of $D_1$, $\\mathrm{col}(D_1)$, is the space of curl flows that are generated by triangles.\n\nA fundamental property of these matrices is that their column spaces are orthogonal, i.e., $D_1^T B = 0$. This ensures that the gradient and curl components are orthogonal.\n\n**2. Orthogonal Decomposition via Least Squares**\n\nThe problem states that the components $y_{\\mathrm{grad}}$ and $y_{\\mathrm{curl}}$ are orthogonal projections of $y$ onto $\\mathrm{col}(B)$ and $\\mathrm{col}(D_1)$, respectively. The orthogonal projection of a vector $y$ onto the column space of a matrix $A$ is given by $P_A y = Ax^*$, where $x^*$ is the solution to the linear least-squares problem:\n$$\nx^* = \\arg\\min_{x} \\lVert Ax - y \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nThis solution is found by solving the normal equations, $(A^T A)x = A^T y$. Modern numerical solvers for least squares, such as `numpy.linalg.lstsq`, robustly find a solution even when $A^T A$ is singular.\n\nThe **gradient component** $y_{\\mathrm{grad}}$ is the projection of $y$ onto $\\mathrm{col}(B)$. We find the potential vector $\\phi$ that minimizes $\\lVert B\\phi - y \\rVert_2^2$ and then set $y_{\\mathrm{grad}} = B\\phi$.\n\nThe **curl component** $y_{\\mathrm{curl}}$ is the projection of $y$ onto $\\mathrm{col}(D_1)$. We find the triangle amplitude vector $\\alpha$ that minimizes $\\lVert D_1\\alpha - y \\rVert_2^2$ and then set $y_{\\mathrm{curl}} = D_1\\alpha$. If the graph is triangle-free ($t=0$), then $D_1$ has no columns, its column space is the zero vector, and thus $y_{\\mathrm{curl}} = 0$.\n\nThe **harmonic component** $y_{\\mathrm{harm}}$ captures the part of the flow that is neither a gradient nor a triangle-based curl. Since $y_{\\mathrm{grad}}$ and $y_{\\mathrm{curl}}$ are orthogonal, it is computed as the residual:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{harm}} = y - y_{\\mathrm{grad}} - y_{\\mathrm{curl}}\n$$\nBy construction, $y_{\\mathrm{harm}}$ is orthogonal to both $y_{\\mathrm{grad}}$ and $y_{\\mathrm{curl}}$. The orthogonality of all three components implies the Pythagorean-like property for their energies (squared $L_2$ norms): $\\lVert y \\rVert_2^2 = \\lVert y_{\\mathrm{grad}} \\rVert_2^2 + \\lVert y_{\\mathrm{curl}} \\rVert_2^2 + \\lVert y_{\\mathrm{harm}} \\rVert_2^2$.\n\n**3. Calculation of Metrics**\n\nOnce the decomposition is complete, we compute the required metrics.\n\n**Energy fractions**: The fraction of the total energy $\\lVert y \\rVert_2^2$ contributed by each component is calculated as:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{grad}} = \\frac{\\lVert y_{\\mathrm{grad}} \\rVert_{2}^{2}}{\\lVert y \\rVert_{2}^{2}}, \\quad f_{\\mathrm{curl}} = \\frac{\\lVert y_{\\mathrm{curl}} \\rVert_{2}^{2}}{\\lVert y \\rVert_{2}^{2}}, \\quad f_{\\mathrm{harm}} = \\frac{\\lVert y_{\\mathrm{harm}} \\rVert_{2}^{2}}{\\lVert y \\rVert_{2}^{2}}\n$$\nIf $\\lVert y \\rVert_{2}=0$, all fractions are defined as $0$.\n\n**Differentiation Concordance ($r_{\\mathrm{grad}}$)**: The concordance between the computed node potential $\\phi$ and the provided pseudotime vector $p$ is measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. The potential $\\phi$ is only determined up to an additive constant for each connected component of the graph, but the Pearson correlation is invariant to such shifts, making it a well-defined metric.\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{grad}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(\\phi, p)}{\\sigma_{\\phi} \\sigma_{p}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\phi_{i}-\\bar{\\phi})(p_{i}-\\bar{p})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\phi_{i}-\\bar{\\phi})^{2}} \\, \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (p_{i}-\\bar{p})^{2}}}\n$$\n\n**Cell Cycle Concordance ($r_{\\mathrm{curl}}$)**: The curl flow is summarized at the node level by the curl exposure vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. For each node $u$, $c_u$ is the root-mean-square (RMS) of the magnitudes of the curl flow $y_{\\mathrm{curl}}$ on its incident edges $E_u$:\n$$\nc_u = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{|E_u|} \\sum_{e \\in E_u} (y_{\\mathrm{curl},e})^2}\n$$\nThe concordance between $c$ and the cell-cycle score vector $s$ is then computed using the Pearson correlation coefficient, $r_{\\mathrm{curl}}$.\n\nFor both correlation calculations, if the standard deviation of either vector is zero, the correlation is defined to be $0$.\n\nThe implementation will systematically follow these steps for each test case provided.\n1.  Construct canonical representations of the graph's edges.\n2.  Build matrices $B$ and $D_1$ based on the graph's topology.\n3.  Construct the input flow vector $y$ as specified.\n4.  Solve the least-squares problems to find $y_{\\mathrm{grad}}$ and $y_{\\mathrm{curl}}$.\n5.  Calculate $y_{\\mathrm{harm}}$ and all derived metrics.\n6.
