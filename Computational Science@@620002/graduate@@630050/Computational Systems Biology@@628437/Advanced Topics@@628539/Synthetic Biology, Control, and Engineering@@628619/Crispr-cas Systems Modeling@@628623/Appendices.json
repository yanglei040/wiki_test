A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe temporal dynamics of the concentrations of pre-CRISPR RNA, $P(t)$, and mature crRNA, $C(t)$, are described by a system of ordinary differential equations. These equations are formulated based on the principle of mass-action kinetics, where the rate of change of a species' concentration is the sum of the rates of all reactions producing it minus the sum of the rates of all reactions consuming it.\n\n**1. Derivation of the ODE for Pre-CRISPR RNA, $P(t)$**\nThe concentration of pre-CRISPR RNA, $P$, changes due to three processes:\n- **Production**: $P$ is transcribed at a constant, zero-order rate $k_t$. The rate of this process is simply $k_t$. This contributes a positive term to the rate of change of $P$.\n- **Processing**: $P$ is processed into crRNA, $C$. This is a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to $P$, so its rate is $k_p P(t)$. This is a consumption pathway for $P$, contributing a negative term.\n- **Removal**: $P$ is removed (degraded/diluted) via a first-order process. The rate of this reaction is $k_d P(t)$. This is another consumption pathway for $P$, contributing a negative term.\n\nCombining these terms gives the ODE for $P(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = (\\text{rate of production}) - (\\text{rate of processing}) - (\\text{rate of removal})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_t - k_p P(t) - k_d P(t)\n$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_t - (k_p + k_d)P(t)\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the ODE for crRNA, $C(t)$**\nThe concentration of mature crRNA, $C$, changes due to two processes:\n- **Production**: $C$ is produced from the processing of $P$. Since the stoichiometry is $1:1$, the rate of production of $C$ is equal to the rate of processing of $P$, which is $k_p P(t)$. This contributes a positive term to the rate of change of $C$.\n- **Removal**: $C$ is removed via a first-order process with rate constant $k_d$. The rate of this reaction is $k_d C(t)$. This is a consumption pathway for $C$, contributing a negative term.\n\nCombining these terms gives the ODE for $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = (\\text{rate of production}) - (\\text{rate of removal})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_p P(t) - k_d C(t)\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Steady-State Concentrations**\nThe steady state of the system is defined by the condition where the concentrations of all species are no longer changing over time. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting all time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dC}{dt} = 0\n$$\nLet $P^*$ and $C^*$ denote the steady-state concentrations. The ODEs become a system of algebraic equations:\n1. $0 = k_t - (k_p + k_d)P^*$\n2. $0 = k_p P^* - k_d C^*$\n\nWe can solve this system sequentially. First, we solve Equation 1 for $P^*$:\n$$\n(k_p + k_d)P^* = k_t\n$$\n$$\nP^* = \\frac{k_t}{k_p + k_d}\n$$\nNext, we solve Equation 2 for $C^*$, using the expression for $P^*$ we just found:\n$$\nk_d C^* = k_p P^*\n$$\n$$\nC^* = \\frac{k_p}{k_d} P^*\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P^*$:\n$$\nC^* = \\frac{k_p}{k_d} \\left( \\frac{k_t}{k_p + k_d} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC^* = \\frac{k_p k_t}{k_d (k_p + k_d)}\n$$\n\nThe steady-state concentrations are therefore $(P^*, C^*) = \\left(\\frac{k_t}{k_p + k_d}, \\frac{k_p k_t}{k_d(k_p + k_d)}\\right)$. These expressions are physically meaningful, as all rate constants ($k_t, k_p, k_d$) are inherently positive, ensuring that the concentrations $P^*$ and $C^*$ are also positive.\n\nThe final answer is the pair of steady-state concentrations presented as a row vector.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{k_{t}}{k_{p} + k_{d}} & \\frac{k_{p} k_{t}}{k_{d}(k_{p} + k_{d})}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3298925"}, {"introduction": "Once assembled, the CRISPR-Cas ribonucleoprotein complex must recognize and cleave its DNA target.

We must calculate the pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_b^*$ for each target and compare it with the other rate constants in the sequence.\n\n**For Target A:**\nThe rate constants are $k_{b,A} = 2.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{r,A} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $k_{c,A} = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nFirst, we calculate the pseudo-first-order binding rate constant, $k_{b,A}^*$:\n$$ k_{b,A}^* = k_{b,A} [E]_0 = (2.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNow we compare the three effective rate constants for target A:\n-   Step $1$ (Binding): $k_{b,A}^* = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   Step $2$ (R-loop formation): $k_{r,A} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   Step $3$ (Cleavage): $k_{c,A} = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nThe smallest rate constant is $k_{r,A} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The new parameters are:\n$$ k_a' = k_a $$\n$$ k_d' = \\frac{k_d}{2} $$\nThe change in dissociation rate affects the mean scanned length per bout. According to the provided scaling relationship:\n$$ \\ell' = \\ell \\sqrt{\\frac{k_d}{k_d'}} = \\ell \\sqrt{\\frac{k_d}{k_d/2}} = \\ell \\sqrt{2} $$\nThe new search time, $T'$, is given by the same general formula but with the new parameters:\n$$ T' = \\frac{L}{\\ell'} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_a'} + \\frac{1}{k_d'} \\right) = \\frac{L}{\\ell\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_a} + \\frac{1}{k_d/2} \\right) = \\frac{L}{\\ell\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_a} + \\frac{2}{k_d} \\right) $$\nThe fold-change $F$ is the ratio $T'/T$:\n$$ F = \\frac{T'}{T} = \\frac{\\frac{L}{\\ell\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_a} + \\frac{2}{k_d} \\right)}{\\frac{L}{\\ell} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_a} + \\frac{1}{k_d} \\right)} $$\nThe term $L/\\ell$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{\\frac{1}{k_a} + \\frac{2}{k_d}}{\\frac{1}{k_a} + \\frac{1}{k_d}} $$\nThis can be written with a common denominator as:\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{\\frac{k_d + 2k_a}{k_a k_d}}{\\frac{k_d + k_a}{k_a k_d}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{k_d + 2k_a}{k_d + k_a} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate $F$ numerically using the given parameter values:\n$k_a = 2.0 \\times 10^{2}~\\text{s}^{-1} = 200~\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_d = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1}~\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.1~\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $F$:\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{0.1 + 2(200)}{0.1 + 200} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{0.1 + 400}{200.1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{400.1}{200.1} $$\nFirst, we compute the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{400.1}{200.1} \\approx 1.99950025 $$\nThen, we divide by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$ F \\approx \\frac{1.99950025}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{1.99950025}{1.41421356} \\approx 1.4137644 $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we get $F = 1.41$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the result. A fold-change of $F \\approx 1.41$ indicates that doubling the non-specific binding affinity increases the mean search time by approximately $41\\%$. This reveals a fundamental tradeoff in the search process.\nOn one hand, increasing the binding affinity (by decreasing $k_d$) makes each one-dimensional sliding bout more productive. The effector remains on the DNA longer, scanning a greater length $\\ell' = \\ell\\sqrt{2}$. This reduces the total number of binding/unbinding cycles needed to cover the entire genome by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{2}$. This effect, in isolation, would speed up the search.\nOn the other hand, the time spent in each binding event, $\\tau_b = 1/k_d$, doubles. With the given parameters, the initial mean free time is $\\tau_f = 1/k_a = 1/200~\\text{s} = 0.005~\\text{s}$, while the initial mean bound time is $\\tau_b = 1/k_d = 1/0.1~\\text{s} = 10~\\text{s}$. The search is overwhelmingly dominated by the time spent non-specifically bound ($\\tau_b \\gg \\tau_f$). Doubling the affinity causes the new bound time to become $\\tau_b' = 20~\\text{s}$. The benefit of needing fewer cycles (a factor of $1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$) is outweighed by the cost of each cycle taking roughly twice as long. The increase in sequestration time on non-specific DNA is the dominant effect, leading to a net slowdown in the overall search. This illustrates that for a given system, there is an optimal non-specific binding affinity that minimizes search time; being too \"sticky\" is as detrimental as not being sticky enough. For these parameters, the system becomes overly sequestered on non-target DNA, hindering efficient target location.\nThe overall effect can be approximated by noting that since $\\tau_f \\ll \\tau_b$, the time per cycle is $\\tau_{cycle} \\approx \\tau_b$. The total search time is $T \\approx (L/\\ell) \\tau_b$. The new time is $T' \\approx (L/\\ell') \\tau_b' = (L/(\\ell\\sqrt{2})) (2\\tau_b) = (L/\\ell)\\tau_b \\times (2/\\sqrt{2}) = T\\sqrt{2}$. The fold-change is thus approximately $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$, which matches our precise calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.41}$$", "id": "3298945"}]}
