This first exercise challenges you to derive this crucial function from fundamental equilibrium principles.

The oligomer has $n$ identical and symmetrically arranged ligand-binding sites for a signaling ligand with free concentration $S$. Activation requires that all $n$ sites be occupied by ligand. The single-site ligand–receptor dissociation constant is $K$, defined by the law of mass action as $K=[R][S]/[RS]$ for an isolated site. Assume thermodynamic equilibrium and that the oligomerization interface confers strong positive cooperativity such that, due to pathway crosstalk with a competing pathway that sequesters partially occupied oligomers, the only thermodynamically populated signaling-relevant macrostates are the unbound oligomer with zero ligands and the fully bound oligomer with $n$ ligands. Under these assumptions, derive from equilibrium binding principles a closed-form expression for the fraction of active receptors $y(S)$ as a function of $S$, $n$, and $K$. In your derivation, start from the law of mass action and a statistical occupancy perspective, and justify any approximations you make. Additionally, explain the specific assumption responsible for producing an effective Hill coefficient equal to $n$ in this model. Express your final answer for $y(S)$ as a dimensionless fraction in a single closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the fraction of active receptors, $y(S)$, for an oligomeric receptor that is active only when all $n$ of its identical binding sites are occupied by a ligand with free concentration $S$. The derivation must be based on equilibrium principles and a critical assumption provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant species in the system. Let $O_0$ represent the unbound receptor oligomer with zero ligands bound. Let $O_n$ represent the fully-liganded receptor oligomer with all $n$ sites occupied. According to the problem statement, due to strong positive cooperativity and sequestration of partially occupied oligomers, \"the only thermodynamically populated signaling-relevant macrostates are the unbound oligomer with zero ligands and the fully bound oligomer with $n$ ligands.\" This is the central simplifying assumption of the model, often referred to as an \"all-or-none\" or infinitely cooperative system.\n\nUnder this assumption, the total concentration of receptor oligomers, $[O]_{total}$, can be expressed as the sum of the concentrations of the only two populated species:\n$$\n[O]_{total} = [O_0] + [O_n]\n$$\nThe receptor is active only when it is in the fully-liganded state, $O_n$. Therefore, the fraction of active receptors, $y(S)$, is the ratio of the concentration of active receptors to the total concentration of receptors:\n$$\ny(S) = \\frac{[O_n]}{[O]_{total}} = \\frac{[O_n]}{[O_0] + [O_n]}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must relate the concentrations $[O_0]$ and $[O_n]$ at thermodynamic equilibrium. The transition between the two populated states can be represented by the following overall binding reaction:\n$$\nO_0 + nS \\rightleftharpoons O_n\n$$\nwhere $n$ molecules of the ligand $S$ bind in a concerted fashion to the receptor $O_0$ to form $O_n$. The law of mass action applied to this equilibrium gives rise to an effective overall dissociation constant, which we shall call $K_{eff}$:\n$$\nK_{eff} = \\frac{[O_0][S]^n}{[O_n]}\n$$\nFrom this expression, we can write the concentration of the active state $[O_n]$ in terms of the inactive state $[O_0]$:\n$$\n[O_n] = \\frac{[O_0][S]^n}{K_{eff}}\n$$\nThe next critical step is to relate $K_{eff}$ to the single-site dissociation constant $K$, which is defined for an isolated binding site as $K = [R][S]/[RS]$. We can establish this relationship from thermodynamic principles. The standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, for a reaction is related to its equilibrium constant. For the binding of a ligand to a single, isolated site, the association constant is $1/K$, so the standard free energy change is $\\Delta G_{site}^\\circ = -RT \\ln(1/K) = RT \\ln(K)$.\n\nThe overall reaction $O_0 + nS \\rightleftharpoons O_n$ involves the binding of $n$ ligands to $n$ identical and symmetrically arranged sites. The total standard Gibbs free energy change for this concerted reaction, $\\Delta G_{total}^\\circ$, is the sum of the free energy changes for each of the $n$ binding events. Since the sites are identical, we have $\\Delta G_{total}^\\circ = n \\cdot \\Delta G_{site}^\\circ$. Substituting the expression for $\\Delta G_{site}^\\circ$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{total}^\\circ = n (RT \\ln(K)) = RT \\ln(K^n)\n$$\nThe overall free energy change is also related to the effective overall dissociation constant $K_{eff}$ by $\\Delta G_{total}^\\circ = RT \\ln(K_{eff})$. By equating the two expressions for $\\Delta G_{total}^\\circ$, we find:\n$$\nRT \\ln(K_{eff}) = RT \\ln(K^n) \\implies K_{eff} = K^n\n$$\nIt is important to note that this result assumes the intrinsic binding affinity of each site is independent of the others; the \"strong positive cooperativity\" mentioned in the problem does not alter the thermodynamic properties of the initial ($O_0$) and final ($O_n$) states, but rather it energetically destabilizes all intermediate states ($O_1, O_2, \\dots, O_{n-1}$), effectively removing them from the equilibrium population.\n\nNow we substitute $K_{eff} = K^n$ back into the expression for $[O_n]$:\n$$\n[O_n] = \\frac{[O_0]S^n}{K^n}\n$$\nWe can now insert this result into our equation for the fraction of active receptors, $y(S)$:\n$$\ny(S) = \\frac{[O_n]}{[O_0] + [O_n]} = \\frac{\\frac{[O_0]S^n}{K^n}}{[O_0] + \\frac{[O_0]S^n}{K^n}}\n$$\nThe term $[O_0]$ is common to all terms and can be canceled out:\n$$\ny(S) = \\frac{\\frac{S^n}{K^n}}{1 + \\frac{S^n}{K^n}}\n$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $K^n$:\n$$\ny(S) = \\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the fraction of active receptors as a function of $S$, $n$, and $K$. This functional form is known as the Hill equation.\n\nThe problem also requires an explanation of the specific assumption responsible for producing an effective Hill coefficient equal to $n$. The general form of the Hill equation is $y(L) = \\frac{L^{n_H}}{K_d^{n_H} + L^{n_H}}$, where $n_H$ is the Hill coefficient, a measure of cooperativity. By comparing this general form with our derived expression, it is clear that the Hill coefficient for this model is $n_H = n$.\n\nThe assumption directly responsible for this result is the \"all-or-none\" binding mechanism, explicitly stated as \"the only thermodynamically populated... macrostates are the unbound oligomer... and the fully bound oligomer\". This assumption forces the entire binding process to be modeled as a single, concerted reaction, $O_0 + nS \\rightleftharpoons O_n$, in which $n$ ligand molecules bind simultaneously. The law of mass action for such a reaction necessarily involves the ligand concentration $S$ raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient, which is $n$. This mathematical form, $[S]^n$, carries through the entire derivation for the fractional occupancy, $y(S)$, and manifests as the exponent $n$ in the final equation. Therefore, the infinite cooperativity assumption, which reduces the multi-step binding process to a single concerted step, is the direct cause of the Hill coefficient being equal to the number of binding sites, $n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{S^n}{K^n + S^n}}\n$$", "id": "3348178"}, {"introduction": "Signaling pathways rarely operate in isolation; they often compete for shared resources, creating a subtle but critical form of crosstalk.
