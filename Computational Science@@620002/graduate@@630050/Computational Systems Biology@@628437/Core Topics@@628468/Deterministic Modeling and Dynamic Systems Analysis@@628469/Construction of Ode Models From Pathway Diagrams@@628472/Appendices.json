Do not provide any numerical approximation. No units are required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and systems biology, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of definitions, and is expressed objectively.\nThe core of the problem is to construct a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the time evolution of species concentrations using the stoichiometric matrix formalism, a standard method in computational systems biology. The governing equation is given as $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = S \\,\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of species concentrations, $S$ is the stoichiometric matrix, and $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the vector of reaction rates.\n\nFirst, we address the role of consistent ordering in preventing sign errors. The matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n \\times m}$ and the vectors $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ are abstract mathematical objects. To give them physical meaning, we must establish a fixed and unambiguous correspondence between their components and the physical entities they represent. Let the species be ordered as $(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)$ and the reactions as $(R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_m)$. We then define the concentration vector $\\mathbf{x}$ such that its $i$-th component, $x_i$, is the concentration of species $X_i$. Similarly, the reaction rate vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is defined such that its $j$-th component, $v_j$, is the rate of reaction $R_j$.\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix $S$ links these two vectors. The element $S_{ij}$ represents the net number of molecules of species $X_i$ created or destroyed by a single event of reaction $R_j$. The sign of $S_{ij}$ is crucial: a positive sign indicates production of $X_i$, and a negative sign indicates consumption. The rate of change of the concentration of species $X_i$ is the sum of contributions from all reactions:\n$$ \\frac{dx_i}{dt} = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} S_{ij} v_j $$\nThis is precisely the $i$-th row of the matrix equation $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = S \\,\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})$. If the ordering of species used to define the rows of $S$ does not match the ordering used to define the elements of $\\mathbf{x}$ (and $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt}$), the equations will be scrambled. For instance, the rate of change calculated for $x_1$ might erroneously use the stoichiometric coefficients for species $X_2$. This would lead to incorrect dynamics, where the signs (consumption vs. production) and magnitudes of the terms are wrong. A consistent, predetermined ordering for both species and reactions is therefore a fundamental prerequisite for correctly translating a reaction network diagram into a valid mathematical model and avoiding sign errors.\n\nNow, we apply this principle to the given problem. The species ordering is specified as $(A,B,C)$, and the reaction ordering is $(R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4)$. Thus, we have $n=3$ species and $m=4$ reactions.\n\nThe species concentration vector is $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_A \\\\ x_B \\\\ x_C \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe stoichiometric matrix $S$ will be a $3 \\times 4$ matrix, where rows correspond to species $A$, $B$, and $C$, and columns correspond to reactions $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, and $R_4$. Each column is the net stoichiometric change vector (products minus reactants) for the corresponding reaction.\n\nFor $R_1: A \\to B$: The net change is $(-1)A + (1)B + (0)C$. The first column of $S$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $R_2: B + C \\to A$: The net change is $(1)A + (-1)B + (-1)C$. The second column of $S$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $R_3: C \\to \\varnothing$: The net change is $(0)A + (0)B + (-1)C$. The third column of $S$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $R_4: A + C \\to B$: The net change is $(-1)A + (1)B + (-1)C$. The fourth column of $S$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAssembling these columns gives the stoichiometric matrix $S$:\n$$ S = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we define the reaction rate vector $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})$ using the law of mass action. The concentrations of species $A$, $B$, and $C$ are denoted $x_A$, $x_B$, and $x_C$. The rate constants are $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$.\n\nThe rate of $R_1: A \\to B$ is $v_1 = k_1 x_A$.\nThe rate of $R_2: B + C \\to A$ is $v_2 = k_2 x_B x_C$.\nThe rate of $R_3: C \\to \\varnothing$ is $v_3 = k_3 x_C$.\nThe rate of $R_4: A + C \\to B$ is $v_4 = k_4 x_A x_C$.\n\nThe reaction rate vector is therefore:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_1 x_A \\\\ k_2 x_B x_C \\\\ k_3 x_C \\\\ k_4 x_A x_C \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe time evolution of the concentration of species $A$, denoted $\\dot{x}_A$ or $\\frac{dx_A}{dt}$, is the first component of the vector product $S\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})$. This is calculated by taking the dot product of the first row of $S$ with the vector $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n\nThe first row of $S$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$ \\dot{x}_A = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} k_1 x_A \\\\ k_2 x_B x_C \\\\ k_3 x_C \\\\ k_4 x_A x_C \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\dot{x}_A = (-1)(k_1 x_A) + (1)(k_2 x_B x_C) + (0)(k_3 x_C) + (-1)(k_4 x_A x_C) $$\n$$ \\dot{x}_A = -k_1 x_A + k_2 x_B x_C - k_4 x_A x_C $$\n\nThis expression represents the net rate of change of the concentration of species $A$. The term $-k_1 x_A$ represents the consumption of $A$ in reaction $R_1$. The term $+k_2 x_B x_C$ represents the production of $A$ in reaction $R_2$. Reaction $R_3$ does not involve $A$, so its rate does not appear. The term $-k_4 x_A x_C$ represents the consumption of $A$ in reaction $R_4$. This confirms the correctness of the derived expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-k_{1}x_{A} + k_{2}x_{B}x_{C} - k_{4}x_{A}x_{C}}$$", "id": "3297226"}, {"introduction": "A mathematical model's validity hinges on the physical assumptions it represents, particularly the definition of the system's boundaries.

Treat $L$ as a fixed parameter $L_0$ but enforce conservation with the complex via $L_0 + C = \\text{const}$...**\nThis option presents two fundamental flaws. First, the assumption $L_0 + C = \\text{const}$ is logically inconsistent with treating $L_0$ as a fixed parameter from a chemostat; if $C$ changes over time, this \"conservation law\" would require $L_0$ to change, contradicting its definition. Such a conservation law applies to a closed system with a finite total amount of ligand, which is neither semantic $S_1$ nor $S_2$. Second, the ODE for $R$, $\\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{syn}} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} R - k_{\\mathrm{on}} L_0 R + k_{\\mathrm{rec}} I$, is missing the $+k_{\\mathrm{off}} C$ term, which represents the formation of free receptor $R$ from the dissociation of the complex $C$. The omission of this term violates the Law of Mass Action for the bidirectional reaction $R+L \\rightleftharpoons C$.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Treat $L$ as a dynamic extracellular state under flow clamp but neglect dissociation as a source to $L$.**\nThis option corresponds to Semantics $S_2$. The equations for $R$, $C$, and $I$ are correct, consistent with our derivation for $S_2$. However, the equation for $L$ is given as $\\frac{dL}{dt} = J_{\\mathrm{in}} - k_{\\mathrm{wash}} L - k_{\\mathrm{on}} L R$. This is incorrect. It is missing the $+k_{\\mathrm{off}} C$ term, which accounts for the production of free ligand $L$ when the complex $C$ dissociates ($C \\to R + L$). The problem states the binding is a bidirectional process $R+L \\rightleftharpoons C$. A consistent application of the Law of Mass Action requires that the dissociation reaction must be a source for both $R$ and $L$. The provided system includes the term for $R$ (in the $dR/dt$ equation) but omits it for $L$, which is an internal inconsistency in the model construction based on the stated reaction.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3297228"}, {"introduction": "Raw ODE models often contain numerous parameters, making it difficult to discern the key factors driving system behavior.

Substituting this into the expression for the derivative gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\frac{S_{0}}{t_{0}} \\frac{ds}{d\\tau}\n$$\n\nNext, we substitute the scaling relation $S = S_{0}s$ into the right-hand side (RHS) of the original ODE:\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = \\frac{V_{\\max} (S_{0}s)}{K_{M} + (S_{0}s)} - k_{d} (S_{0}s)\n$$\n\nNow, we equate the transformed left-hand side and right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{S_{0}}{t_{0}} \\frac{ds}{d\\tau} = \\frac{V_{\\max} S_{0}s}{K_{M} + S_{0}s} - k_{d} S_{0}s\n$$\nTo obtain the dimensionless ODE for $\\frac{ds}{d\\tau}$, we multiply the entire equation by $\\frac{t_{0}}{S_{0}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{d\\tau} = \\frac{t_{0}}{S_{0}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max} S_{0}s}{K_{M} + S_{0}s} - k_{d} S_{0}s \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the $\\frac{t_{0}}{S_{0}}$ term, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{d\\tau} = \\frac{t_{0} V_{\\max} s}{K_{M} + S_{0}s} - t_{0} k_{d} s\n$$\nTo reveal the dimensionless parameters, we factor the denominator of the first term on the RHS to isolate the dimensionless variable $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{d\\tau} = \\frac{t_{0} V_{\\max} s}{S_{0} \\left( \\frac{K_{M}}{S_{0}} + s \\right)} - t_{0} k_{d} s\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we arrive at the general dimensionless form:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{d\\tau} = \\left( \\frac{t_{0} V_{\\max}}{S_{0}} \\right) \\frac{s}{\\left( \\frac{K_{M}}{S_{0}} \\right) + s} - (t_{0} k_{d}) s\n$$\nThis equation has the structure $\\frac{ds}{d\\tau} = \\alpha \\frac{s}{\\kappa + s} - \\delta s$. By comparing terms, we identify the dimensionless parameters $\\alpha$, $\\kappa$, and $\\delta$ in terms of the original parameters and the scaling constants:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{t_{0} V_{\\max}}{S_{0}}\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{K_{M}}{S_{0}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = t_{0} k_{d}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the choice of scaling constants: the concentration scale is set by the Michaelis constant, $S_{0} = K_{M}$, and the time scale is set by the inverse of the degradation rate constant, $t_{0} = \\frac{1}{k_{d}}$.\n\nWe now substitute these specific choices into the expressions for $\\alpha$, $\\kappa$, and $\\delta$ to obtain their final forms.\n\nFor $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{k_{d}}) V_{\\max}}{K_{M}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{M} k_{d}}\n$$\n\nFor $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{K_{M}}{S_{0}} = \\frac{K_{M}}{K_{M}} = 1\n$$\n\nFor $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = t_{0} k_{d} = \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{d}}\\right) k_{d} = 1\n$$\nThus, the three dimensionless parameters are $\\alpha = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{M} k_{d}}$, $\\kappa = 1$, and $\\delta = 1$. The resulting dimensionless ODE is:\n$$\n\\fracds}{d\\tau} = \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{M} k_{d}} \\right) \\frac{s}{1 + s} - s\n$$\nThe problem requires the ordered triple of these parameters $(\\alpha, \\kappa, \\delta)$ as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{M} k_{d}} & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3297181"}]}
