Using the enzyme conservation law to substitute $[E](t) = E_0 - [ES](t)$, the system can be described by two coupled ODEs for $[S]$ and $[ES]$:\n$$\n\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = -k_1 (E_0 - [ES]) [S] + k_{-1} [ES]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 (E_0 - [ES]) [S] - (k_{-1} + k_2) [ES]\n$$\nThe product concentration is found algebraically: $[P](t) = S_0 - [S](t) - [ES](t)$. The initial conditions are $[S](0) = S_0$ and $[ES](0) = 0$.\n\n### Model 2: The Standard Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA)\n\nThe QSSA assumes that the complex concentration rapidly reaches a steady state, $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$.

The QSSA further assumes that substrate sequestration is negligible, so $[S](t)+[P](t) \\approx S_0$, which means $\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = -\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = -k_2 [ES]$. This reduces the system to a single ODE for $[S]$:\n$$\n\\frac{d[S]}{dt} \\approx -k_2 [ES]_{\\text{qssa}}([S]) = - \\frac{k_2 E_0 [S]}{[S] + K_M}\n$$\nThe initial condition is $[S](0)=S_0$, and the product is $[P](t) = S_0 - [S](t)$.\n\n### Model 3: The Total Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (tQSSA)\n\nThe tQSSA improves upon the QSSA by choosing a better slow variable: the total substrate, $S_T(t) = [S](t) + [ES](t)$. The dynamics of $S_T$ are governed by the exact equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dS_T}{dt} = \\frac{d[S]}{dt} + \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = -k_2 [ES](t)\n$$\nThe QSSA condition $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$ is still used, but now $[S]$ is expressed as $[S] = S_T - [ES]$. This leads to a quadratic equation for $[ES]$ in terms of the slow variable $S_T$:\n$$\n[ES]^2 - (E_0 + S_T + K_M)[ES] + E_0 S_T = 0\n$$\nThe physically meaningful solution for $[ES]$ is the smaller root of this quadratic equation:\n$$\n[ES]_{\\text{tqssa}}(S_T) = \\frac{(E_0 + S_T + K_M) - \\sqrt{(E_0 + S_T + K_M)^2 - 4 E_0 S_T}}{2}\n$$\nThe tQSSA model is the single ODE for $S_T(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dS_T}{dt} = -k_2 [ES]_{\\text{tqssa}}(S_T(t))\n$$\nwith initial condition $S_T(0) = S_0$.

The resulting trajectories for $S(t)$ and $P(t)$ from QSSA and tQSSA are compared to the solution from the exact mass-action model.

The free active kinase is $E^{\\text{free}} = E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}} - C_1 - C_2$.\n- Feedback activation: the inactive free kinase $E_{\\text{inact}}^{\\text{free}} = E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}} - C_1 - C_2$ is converted to active free kinase via binding to $S_2$ with on-rate $k_{a}^{\\text{on}}$ and off-rate $k_{a}^{\\text{off}}$. To allow cooperative activation, assume mass-action order $p$ in $S_2$, so the activation reaction rate is $k_{a}^{\\text{on}} S_2^{p} E_{\\text{inact}}^{\\text{free}}$, and deactivation rate is $k_{a}^{\\text{off}} E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}$.\n- The full model ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are constructed from the Law of Mass Action for binding, unbinding, catalysis, and activation/deactivation. The outputs to be measured are the steady-state fraction of fully phosphorylated substrate $y = [S_2] / S_{\\text{tot}}$, where $S_{\\text{tot}} = [S_0] + [S_1] + [S_2] + [C_1] + [C_2] + [D_1] + [D_2]$ is conserved by construction.\n\nReduced model requirements:\n- Apply Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) to eliminate $C_1$, $C_2$, $D_1$, and $D_2$, yielding effective rates for the four transitions in terms of $S_0$, $S_1$, $S_2$, and enzyme totals.\n- Apply Rapid-Equilibrium Approximation (REA) to eliminate $E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}$ in favor of an algebraic fraction of $E_{\\text{tot}}$ activated by $S_2$ with cooperative order $p$, so that the active fraction depends on $S_2$ via an equilibrium relation determined by $k_{a}^{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{a}^{\\text{off}}$.\n- The reduced model ODEs must be expressed only in terms of $S_0$, $S_1$, $S_2$ and parameters, without explicit complexes or $E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}$ dynamics.\n\nYour program must:\n- Numerically integrate both the full model and the reduced model to steady state for specified parameter values.\n- For dose-response analysis, vary $E_{\\text{tot}}$ over a prescribed range while holding other parameters fixed, compute the steady-state output $y$, and estimate the effective Hill coefficient $n_{\\text{H}}$ by the local slope at half-maximal response using the derivative of $\\log\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right)$ with respect to $\\log(E_{\\text{tot}})$ evaluated near $y = 0.5$.\n- Determine ultrasensitivity reproduction by checking whether both models exhibit $n_{\\text{H}}$ greater than a threshold and the difference in $n_{\\text{H}}$ is within a tolerance.\n- Determine bistability reproduction by checking, for fixed parameters including positive feedback ($p \\geq 2$), whether the steady states reached from two distinct initial conditions for $S_2$ are different in each model.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (ultrasensitivity regime): parameters chosen such that both kinase and phosphatase operate near saturation with small $K_m$ values relative to substrate abundance. Use $S_{\\text{tot}} = 1$, $k_{1}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{1}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $k_{1}^{\\text{cat}} = 1$, $k_{2}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{2}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $k_{2}^{\\text{cat}} = 1$, $k_{f1}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{f1}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $k_{f1}^{\\text{cat}} = 1$, $k_{f2}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{f2}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $k_{f2}^{\\text{cat}} = 1$, $F_{\\text{tot}} = 0.05$, $k_{a}^{\\text{on}} = 0$, $k_{a}^{\\text{off}} = 0$, $p = 1$. Sweep $E_{\\text{tot}}$ over $50$ points between $0.005$ and $0.2$. Ultrasensitivity reproduction is $True$ if both models have $n_{\\text{H}} \\geq 1.7$ and $|n_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{full}} - n_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{red}}| \\leq 0.7$.\n- Case $2$ (non-ultrasensitive boundary regime): increase enzyme totals to reduce saturation. Use identical rates as Case $1$, but with $F_{\\text{tot}} = 0.5$. Sweep $E_{\\text{tot}}$ over $50$ points between $0.005$ and $0.5$. Non-ultrasensitivity reproduction is $True$ if both models have $n_{\\text{H}} \\leq 1.3$.\n- Case $3$ (bistability with positive feedback): parameters chosen to induce cooperative activation of kinase by $S_2$. Use $S_{\\text{tot}} = 1$, $k_{1}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{1}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $k_{1}^{\\text{cat}} = 1$, $k_{2}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{2}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $k_{2}^{\\text{cat}} = 1$, $k_{f1}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{f1}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $k_{f1}^{\\text{cat}} = 1$, $k_{f2}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{f2}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $k_{f2}^{\\text{cat}} = 1$, $E_{\\text{tot}} = 0.12$, $F_{\\text{tot}} = 0.05$, $k_{a}^{\\text{on}} = 100$, $k_{a}^{\\text{off}} = 1$, $p = 2$. Initialize once with $(S_0,S_1,S_2) = (1,0,0)$ and once with $(S_0,S_1,S_2) = (0,0,1)$. Bistability reproduction is $True$ if the two steady-state values of $S_2$ differ by at least $0.1$ for both the full and reduced models.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For the three test cases described above, your program must compute a boolean for each case:\n    - Case $1$: $True$ if ultrasensitivity reproduction holds, otherwise $False$.\n    - Case $2$: $True$ if non-ultrasensitivity reproduction holds, otherwise $False$.\n    - Case $3$: $True$ if bistability reproduction holds, otherwise $False$.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example $[b_1,b_2,b_3]$, where each $b_i$ is $True$ or $False$ without additional text.", "solution": "The problem requires constructing and solving two models of a MAPK cascade: a full mechanistic model based on mass-action kinetics, and a reduced model using QSSA and REA. The solution involves deriving the ODEs for both models and then implementing a numerical simulation to test for ultrasensitivity and bistability.\n\n### 1. Full Mechanistic Model Derivation\n\nThe full model is a system of 8 ODEs for the species $S_0, S_1, S_2, C_1, C_2, D_1, D_2, E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}$. The rate equations are derived directly from the law of mass action for each elementary step. Free enzyme concentrations $F^{\\text{free}}$ and $E_{\\text{inact}}^{\\text{free}}$ are determined by conservation laws:\n- $F^{\\text{free}} = F_{\\text{tot}} - D_1 - D_2$\n- $E_{\\text{inact}}^{\\text{free}} = E_{\\text{tot}} - E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}} - C_1 - C_2$\n\nThe ODE system is as follows:\n$$ \\frac{dS_0}{dt} = -k_{1}^{\\text{on}} [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_0] + k_{1}^{\\text{off}} [C_1] + k_{f1}^{\\text{cat}} [D_1] $$\n$$ \\frac{dS_1}{dt} = k_{1}^{\\text{cat}} [C_1] - k_{2}^{\\text{on}} [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_1] + k_{2}^{\\text{off}} [C_2] - k_{f1}^{\\text{on}} [F^{\\text{free}}] [S_1] + k_{f1}^{\\text{off}} [D_1] + k_{f2}^{\\text{cat}} [D_2] $$\n$$ \\frac{dS_2}{dt} = k_{2}^{\\text{cat}} [C_2] - k_{f2}^{\\text{on}} [F^{\\text{free}}] [S_2] + k_{f2}^{\\text{off}} [D_2] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[C_1]}{dt} = k_{1}^{\\text{on}} [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_0] - (k_{1}^{\\text{off}} + k_{1}^{\\text{cat}})[C_1] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[C_2]}{dt} = k_{2}^{\\text{on}} [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_1] - (k_{2}^{\\text{off}} + k_{2}^{\\text{cat}})[C_2] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[D_1]}{dt} = k_{f1}^{\\text{on}} [F^{\\text{free}}] [S_1] - (k_{f1}^{\\text{off}} + k_{f1}^{\\text{cat}})[D_1] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[D_2]}{dt} = k_{f2}^{\\text{on}} [F^{\\text{free}}] [S_2] - (k_{f2}^{\\text{off}} + k_{f2}^{\\text{cat}})[D_2] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}]}{dt} = (-k_{1}^{\\text{on}} [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_0] + (k_{1}^{\\text{off}} + k_{1}^{\\text{cat}}) [C_1]) + (-k_{2}^{\\text{on}} [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_1] + (k_{2}^{\\text{off}} + k_{2}^{\\text{cat}}) [C_2]) + k_{a}^{\\text{on}} [S_2]^{p} [E_{\\text{inact}}^{\\text{free}}] - k_{a}^{\\text{off}} [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] $$\n\n### 2. Reduced Model Derivation (QSSA + REA)\n\nThe reduced model simplifies the system by eliminating the fast variables (enzyme-substrate complexes) and the fast kinase activation dynamics.\n\n**QSSA for Enzyme-Substrate Complexes:**\nWe apply the QSSA to the four complexes $C_1, C_2, D_1, D_2$ by setting their time derivatives to zero. For the kinase complexes, this gives:\n$$ [C_1] = \\frac{k_{1}^{\\text{on}} [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_0]}{k_{1}^{\\text{off}} + k_{1}^{\\text{cat}}} = \\frac{[E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_0]}{K_{M1}}, \\quad [C_2] = \\frac{[E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] [S_1]}{K_{M2}} $$\nwhere $K_{Mi} = (k_{i}^{\\text{off}} + k_{i}^{\\text{cat}}) / k_{i}^{\\text{on}}$. The total active kinase is $E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{total}} = [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] + [C_1] + [C_2]$. Substituting the expressions for $[C_1]$ and $[C_2]$ allows us to solve for $[E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}]$:\n$$ [E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{free}}] = \\frac{E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{total}}}{1 + [S_0]/K_{M1} + [S_1]/K_{M2}} $$\nThe effective phosphorylation rates $v_1$ and $v_2$ are then $k_{1}^{\\text{cat}}[C_1]$ and $k_{2}^{\\text{cat}}[C_2]$, which, after substitution, yield the standard Michaelis-Menten expressions for two competing substrates:\n$$ v_1 = \\frac{k_{1}^{\\text{cat}} E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{total}} [S_0] / K_{M1}}{1 + [S_0]/K_{M1} + [S_1]/K_{M2}}, \\quad v_2 = \\frac{k_{2}^{\\text{cat}} E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{total}} [S_1] / K_{M2}}{1 + [S_0]/K_{M1} + [S_1]/K_{M2}} $$\nAn analogous derivation for the phosphatase yields the dephosphorylation rates $v_{f1}$ and $v_{f2}$.\n\n**REA for Kinase Activation:**\nThe feedback activation $pS_2 + E_{\\text{inact}} \\rightleftharpoons E_{\\text{act}}$ is assumed to be in rapid equilibrium: $k_{a}^{\\text{on}} [S_2]^p [E_{\\text{inact}}] \\approx k_{a}^{\\text{off}} [E_{\\text{act}}]$. Let $K_A = k_{a}^{\\text{off}}/k_{a}^{\\text{on}}$ be the dissociation constant for this process. The total kinase concentration is $E_{\\text{tot}} = [E_{\\text{act}}] + [E_{\\text{inact}}]$. Solving these two equations gives the fraction of active kinase:\n$$ \\frac{[E_{\\text{act}}]}{E_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{[S_2]^p}{K_A + [S_2]^p} $$\nThe total amount of active kinase available for catalysis is therefore $E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{tot}} \\frac{[S_2]^p}{K_A + [S_2]^p}$. For cases without feedback ($k_a^{\\text{on}}=0$), we assume the kinase is constitutively active, so $E_{\\text{act}}^{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\n**Reduced ODE System:**\nThe reduced model tracks only the slow variables $S_0, S_1, S_2$. Using the conservation law $S_{\\text{tot}} = [S_0] + [S_1] + [S_2]$, we can describe the system with two ODEs for $S_1$ and $S_2$:\n$$ \\frac{d[S_1]}{dt} = v_1 - v_2 + v_{f2} - v_{f1} $$\n$$ \\frac{d[S_2]}{dt} = v_2 - v_{f2} $$", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the three test cases for the MAPK cascade problem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Full Model ODE System ---\n    def full_model_ode(t, y, params):\n        S0, S1, S2, C1, C2, D1, D2, E_act_free = y\n        \n        k1_on, k1_off, k1_cat, k2_on, k2_off, k2_cat, \\\n        kf1_on, kf1_off, kf1_cat, kf2_on, kf2_off, kf2_cat, \\\n        ka_on, ka_off, p, Etot, Ftot, Stot = params\n\n        # Clamp concentrations to be non-negative to handle numerical artifacts\n        y[y  0] = 0\n        S0, S1, S2, C1, C2, D1, D2, E_act_free = y\n\n        # Algebraic calculation of free molecular species from conservation laws\n        F_free = Ftot -
