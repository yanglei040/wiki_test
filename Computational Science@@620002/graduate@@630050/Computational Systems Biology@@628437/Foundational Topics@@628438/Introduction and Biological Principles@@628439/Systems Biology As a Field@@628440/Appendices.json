Solution of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation**\n\nThe model is the linear first-order ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -k x(t)\n$$\nThis equation is separable. We can rearrange it as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x} dx = -k dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(x_0, 0)$ to a general state $(x(t), t)$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{x_0}^{x(t)} \\frac{1}{x'} dx' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|x'|]_{x_0}^{x(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince $x_0 > 0$ and the system describes decay, $x(t)$ will remain positive for all finite $t$.

Derivation of the Parameter Sensitivity $s(t)$**\n\nThe local parameter sensitivity, $s(t)$, is defined as the partial derivative of the state variable $x(t)$ with respect to the parameter $k$.\n$$\ns(t) = \\frac{\\partial x(t)}{\\partial k}\n$$\nUsing the solution derived above, $x(t) = x_0 \\exp(-kt)$, we differentiate with respect to $k$, treating $x_0$ and $t$ as constants. Applying the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$\ns(t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left( x_0 \\exp(-kt) \\right) = x_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left( \\exp(-kt) \\right)\n$$\n$$\ns(t) = x_0 \\cdot \\exp(-kt) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(-kt)\n$$\n$$\ns(t) = x_0 \\exp(-kt) (-t)\n$$\n$$\ns(t) = -t x_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the expression for the sensitivity of the concentration $x(t)$ to changes in the rate constant $k$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Fisher Information (FI) for $k$**\n\nThe Fisher Information for a parameter quantifies the amount of information that a set of observable random variables carries about that parameter. We will derive it from the log-likelihood function.\n\nThe observation at time $t_i$ is $y(t_i) = x(t_i) + \\epsilon_i$, where $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. This implies that each observation $y_i \\equiv y(t_i)$ is a random variable drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu_i = x(t_i; k) = x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. The probability density function (PDF) for a single observation $y_i$ is:\n$$\np(y_i | k) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\n$$\nSince the noise terms $\\epsilon_i$ are independent, the observations $y_i$ are also independent. The likelihood function $L(k)$ for the entire set of $N$ observations is the product of the individual PDFs:\n$$\nL(k) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} p(y_i | k) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\right)^{N/2} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i))^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe log-likelihood function, $\\mathcal{L}(k) = \\ln(L(k))$, is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(k) = -\\frac{N}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i))^2\n$$\nThe Fisher Information, $FI(k)$, is defined as the negative of the expected value of the second derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to the parameter $k$:\n$$\nFI(k) = -E\\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}(k)}{\\partial k^2} \\right]\n$$\nFirst, we compute the first derivative (the score):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k} = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2(y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(x_0 \\exp(-kt_i))\\right)\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) = s(t_i)$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) \\cdot s(t_i)\n$$\nNext, we compute the second derivative by differentiating the score with respect to $k$ using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left[ (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) \\cdot s(t_i) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i))\\right) s(t_i) + (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) \\frac{\\partial s(t_i)}{\\partial k} \\right]\n$$\nThe first term in the bracket has $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) = -s(t_i)$. So the first part of the sum becomes $-s(t_i)^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ -s(t_i)^2 + (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) \\frac{\\partial s(t_i)}{\\partial k} \\right]\n$$\nNow we compute the expectation. The expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of the data $y_i$.\n$$\nFI(k) = -E\\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k^2} \\right] = -E\\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( -s(t_i)^2 + (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) \\frac{\\partial s(t_i)}{\\partial k} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation:\n$$\nFI(k) = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E\\left[ -s(t_i)^2 + (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) \\frac{\\partial s(t_i)}{\\partial k} \\right]\n$$\nThe terms $s(t_i)^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial s(t_i)}{\\partial k}$ are deterministic functions of $k$ and $t_i$; they are not random. The only random variable is $y_i$. We note that $E[y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)] = E[\\epsilon_i] = 0$. Therefore, the expectation of the second term in the sum is zero.\n$$\nE\\left[ (y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)) \\frac{\\partial s(t_i)}{\\partial k} \\right] = E[y_i - x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)] \\cdot \\frac{\\partial s(t_i)}{\\partial k} = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies the expression for $FI(k)$ considerably:\n$$\nFI(k) = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[-s(t_i)^2] = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s(t_i)^2\n$$\nThis is a general result for additive i.i.d. Gaussian noise: the Fisher Information is the sum of the squared sensitivities, scaled by the inverse variance.\nSubstituting our expression for $s(t_i) = -t_i x_0 \\exp(-kt_i)$:\n$$\nFI(k) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (-t_i x_0 \\exp(-kt_i))^2\n$$\n$$\nFI(k) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i^2 x_0^2 \\exp(-2kt_i)\n$$\nFactoring out the constants gives the final expression for the Fisher Information:\n$$\nFI(k) = \\frac{x_0^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i^2 \\exp(-2kt_i)\n$$\n\n**3. Condition for Practical Identifiability**\n\nA parameter is practically identifiable if it can be estimated with finite uncertainty from a finite, noisy dataset. The Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) states that the variance of any unbiased estimator $\\hat{k}$ is bounded below by the inverse of the Fisher Information: $\\text{Var}(\\hat{k}) \\ge [FI(k)]^{-1}$.\n\nFor the variance to be finite, the CRLB must be finite and positive. This requires the Fisher Information, $FI(k)$, to be strictly positive and finite. Let us analyze our expression:\n$$\nFI(k) = \\frac{x_0^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i^2 \\exp(-2kt_i)\n$$\nWe are given that $x_0 > 0$ and variance $\\sigma^2 > 0$, so the pre-factor $\\frac{x_0^2}{\\sigma^2}$ is strictly positive. The information content is therefore determined by the sum.\nEach term in the summation is of the form $t_i^2 \\exp(-2kt_i)$. Given $k > 0$ and $t_i \\ge 0$, the exponential term $\\exp(-2kt_i)$ is always positive. The term $t_i^2$ is non-negative. Thus, every term in the sum is non-negative.\nThe total sum is zero if and only if every term is zero. A term $t_i^2 \\exp(-2kt_i)$ is zero if and only if $t_i = 0$.\nConsequently, $FI(k) = 0$ if and only if all sampling times $t_i$ are equal to $0$. If all measurements are taken at $t=0$, we only observe the initial state $x_0$ and gain no information about the dynamics governed by $k$. In this case, the CRLB is infinite, and the parameter $k$ is practically unidentifiable.\n\nFor $k$ to be practically identifiable, we must have $FI(k) > 0$. This condition is satisfied if at least one term in the sum is strictly positive. This occurs if there exists at least one sampling time $t_i$ such that $t_i > 0$.\n\n**Conclusion on Identifiability**: The parameter $k$ is practically identifiable if and only if at least one measurement is taken at a time $t_i > 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -t x_0 \\exp(-kt) & \\frac{x_0^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i^2 \\exp(-2kt_i) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3353994"}, {"introduction": "Biological systems often achieve sharp, decisive responses using components that individually are only weakly responsive.

It is based on standard models of biochemical reaction kinetics used in systems biology, and all necessary parameters and definitions are provided.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the single-step activation output, $y_1(x)$. The problem states that the steady-state fraction of a phosphorylated site can be derived from the rapid binding equilibrium between the kinase and the substrate. Let $S$ be the unphosphorylated substrate site, and $K$ be the active kinase with concentration $x$. The binding reaction is $S + K \\rightleftharpoons SK$. The dissociation constant is given by $K_d = \\frac{[S][K]}{[SK]}$. Using $[K] = x$, this becomes $K_d = \\frac{[S]x}{[SK]}$. The total concentration of the substrate site is $[S]_{\\text{tot}} = [S] + [SK]$. The fraction of phosphorylated substrate, $y_1(x)$, is the fraction of sites bound by the kinase at equilibrium:\n$$\ny_1(x) = \\frac{[SK]}{[S]_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{[SK]}{[S] + [SK]}\n$$\nBy rearranging the expression for $K_d$, we have $[SK] = \\frac{[S]x}{K_d}$.

The substrate is fully phosphorylated after two independent, sequential events, each with the same kinetics. The probability of a single site being phosphorylated is $f(x) = y_1(x) = \\frac{x}{K_d + x}$.
