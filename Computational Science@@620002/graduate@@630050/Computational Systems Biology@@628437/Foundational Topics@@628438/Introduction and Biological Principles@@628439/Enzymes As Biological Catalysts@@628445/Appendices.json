Our goal is to express $[ES]$ in terms of measurable quantities.\n\nThe quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) assumes that after a very brief initial transient period, the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant. This is mathematically expressed as $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this to the third ODE gives:\n$$\nk_1[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] \\approx 0\n$$\n\nWe are also given the conservation law for the total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, which states that the enzyme exists either in its free form, $[E]$, or in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$\n[E]_T = [E] + [ES]\n$$\nThis allows us to express the concentration of free enzyme as $[E] = [E]_T - [ES]$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the QSSA equation:\n$$\nk_1([E]_T - [ES])[S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] \\approx 0\n$$\n\nNow, we solve this algebraic equation for $[ES]$:\n$$\nk_1[E]_T[S] - k_1[ES][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] \\approx 0\n$$\n$$\nk_1[E]_T[S] \\approx [ES](k_1[S] + k_{-1} + k_2)\n$$\n$$\n[ES] \\approx \\frac{k_1[E]_T[S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]}\n$$\n\nThe rate of product formation, $v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt}$, is given by $k_2[ES]$. Substituting the derived expression for $[ES]$:\n$$\nv \\approx k_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1[E]_T[S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]} \\right) = \\frac{k_1k_2[E]_T[S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]}\n$$\n\nTo obtain the standard Michaelis-Menten form, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_1$:\n$$\nv \\approx \\frac{k_2[E]_T[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]}\n$$\n\nThis equation is in the form $v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$. By comparing the two forms, we can identify expressions for the emergent kinetic parameters $V_{\\max}$ and $K_m$:\nThe maximum reaction rate, $V_{\\max}$, is the rate when the enzyme is saturated with substrate ($[S] \\to \\infty$), which gives $v \\to k_2[E]_T$. Therefore:\n$$\nV_{\\max} = k_2[E]_T\n$$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of $V_{\\max}$. From the derived equation, this corresponds to the term in the denominator. Therefore:\n$$\nK_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: QSSA Validity Condition**\n\nThe standard quasi-steady-state approximation (sQSSA) is justified when the concentration of the intermediate complex, $[ES]$, equilibrates on a much faster timescale than the concentration of the substrate, $[S]$. This condition ensures that $d[ES]/dt$ is negligible over the course of the reaction. A widely used quantitative condition for the validity of the sQSSA is that the total enzyme concentration must be much smaller than the sum of the initial substrate concentration and the Michaelis constant:\n$$\n[E]_T \\ll K_m + [S]_0\n$$\nwhere $[S]_0$ is the initial substrate concentration.\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n$[E]_T = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$[S]_0 = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n$k_1 = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$\n$k_{-1} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n$k_2 = 100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate $K_m$ using these values:\n$$\nK_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{10^7\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}} = \\frac{110}{10^7}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 11 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nConverting this to micromolar units, $K_m = 11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nNow, we check the validity condition:\n$$\n[E]_T \\ll K_m + [S]_0\n$$\n$$\n1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} \\ll 11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\n$$\n1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} \\ll 111\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{[E]_T}{K_m + [S]_0} = \\frac{1}{111} \\approx 0.009$.

The rate constants are $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Michaelis–Menten constant, $K_m$. We begin by writing the rate equation for the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$, based on the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_2[ES] $$\nThe problem states that the total enzyme concentration, $E_T$, is conserved. Thus, the concentration of free enzyme $[E]$ is related to the total enzyme concentration $[E_T]$ and the complex concentration $[ES]$ by:\n$$ [E_T] = [E] + [ES] \\implies [E] = [E_T] - [ES] $$\nSubstituting this into the rate equation for $[ES]$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 ([E_T] - [ES])[S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nThe quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ changes much more slowly than the concentrations of substrate and product, and thus its rate of change can be set to zero: $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this approximation:\n$$ 0 \\approx k_1 ([E_T] - [ES])[S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nWe now solve for the steady-state concentration of the complex, $[ES]_{ss}$:\n$$ k_1 [E_T][S] - k_1 [ES]_{ss}[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]_{ss} $$\n$$ k_1 [E_T][S] = (k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]_{ss} $$\n$$ [ES]_{ss} = \\frac{k_1 [E_T][S]}{k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_2} $$\nTo obtain the standard Michaelis-Menten form, we divide the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n$$ [ES]_{ss} = \\frac{[E_T][S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}} $$\nThe rate of product formation, $v$, is given by $v = k_2 [ES]$. Substituting the steady-state concentration $[ES]_{ss}$:\n$$ v = \\frac{k_2 [E_T][S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}} $$\nThis equation is in the form of the Michaelis-Menten rate law, $v = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$, where $V_{max} = k_2[E_T]$. By comparison, we identify the Michaelis-Menten constant $K_m$ as:\n$$ K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} $$\nThe problem defines the equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding step as $K_d = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1}$. We are asked for the condition under which $K_m \\approx K_d$.\n$$ \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} \\approx \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1} $$\nThis approximation is valid if and only if $k_{-1} + k_2 \\approx k_{-1}$, which requires that $k_2$ is negligible compared to $k_{-1}$. The condition is therefore:\n$$ k_2 \\ll k_{-1} $$\n\nSecond, we explain the physical significance of this condition. The rate constants $k_{-1}$ and $k_2$ have units of inverse time. Their reciprocals, $1/k_{-1}$ and $1/k_2$, represent the characteristic timescales for the dissociation of the $ES$ complex back into $E$ and $S$, and for the catalytic conversion of $ES$ into $E$ and $P$, respectively. The condition $k_2 \\ll k_{-1}$ is equivalent to $1/k_2 \\gg 1/k_{-1}$.\nThis means that the timescale for catalysis is much longer than the timescale for complex dissociation. Physically, this implies that the binding and unbinding of the substrate ($E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES$) occurs much more rapidly than the chemical conversion of the substrate into product ($ES \\rightarrow E+P$). Consequently, the first step of the reaction, the binding, reaches a fast equilibrium before any significant amount of product is formed. This is known as the **rapid-equilibrium approximation**. Under this assumption, the $ES$ complex is much more likely to dissociate back to enzyme and substrate than it is to proceed to product formation. In this regime, $K_m$ indeed serves as a measure of the enzyme's binding affinity for the substrate, as it approximates the true dissociation constant $K_d$.\n\nThird, we compute the fractional error $\\varepsilon$ given the parameters $K_d = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $k_2 = 50\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and $k_{-1} = 5000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The fractional error is defined as:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{|K_m - K_d|}{K_d} $$\nWe can substitute the fundamental expressions for $K_m$ and $K_d$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{|\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} - \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1}|}{\\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1}} $$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$ |\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2 - k_{-1}}{k_1}| = |\\frac{k_2}{k_1}| = \\frac{k_2}{k_1} \\quad (\\text{since } k_1, k_2 > 0) $$\nNow, substituting this back into the expression for $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\frac{k_2}{k_1}}{\\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1}} = \\frac{k_2}{k_{-1}} $$\nThis elegant result shows that the fractional error is simply the ratio of the catalytic rate constant to the reverse binding rate constant.
