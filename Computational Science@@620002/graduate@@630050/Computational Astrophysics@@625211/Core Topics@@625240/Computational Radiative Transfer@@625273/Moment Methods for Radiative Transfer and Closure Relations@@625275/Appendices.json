Numerical evaluation of $f$, $\\chi(f)$, and the components of $\\mathsf{P}$ for the given state.\n3.  Qualitative comparison of the resulting pressure tensor with the one from the diffusion approximation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the M1 Closure Relation**\n\nThe radiation field is described by the stress-energy tensor $T^{\\alpha\\beta}$, which in the laboratory frame has components related to the radiation energy density $E$, flux vector $\\mathbf{F}$, and pressure tensor $\\mathsf{P}$ as:\n$$\nT^{00} = E, \\quad T^{0i} = T^{i0} = \\frac{F_i}{c}, \\quad T^{ij} = P_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and indices $i, j$ run from $1$ to $3$.\n\nThe problem states that in a comoving frame, moving with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ relative to the laboratory frame, the radiation field is isotropic. This is the rest frame of the radiation. In this frame (denoted by primed coordinates), the radiation flux is zero ($\\mathbf{F}'=0$), and the pressure is isotropic. For a photon gas, the isotropic pressure $p'$ is related to the energy density $E'$ by $p' = E'/3$. The pressure tensor in the rest frame is thus $P'_{ij} = (E'/3)\\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe stress-energy tensor in the rest frame, $T'^{\\alpha'\\beta'}$, is therefore:\n$$\nT'^{\\alpha'\\beta'} = \\begin{pmatrix} E' & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & E'/3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & E'/3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & E'/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo find the tensor in the laboratory frame, we perform a Lorentz boost on $T'^{\\alpha'\\beta'}$. We align the boost with the direction of the radiation flux $\\mathbf{F}$, which without loss of generality we take to be the $x$-axis. The velocity of the rest frame relative to the lab frame is $\\mathbf{v} = v\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The Lorentz transformation matrix $\\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\alpha'}$ for this boost is:\n$$\n\\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\alpha'} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma & \\gamma\\beta & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma\\beta & \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$ and $\\gamma = (1-\\beta^2)^{-1/2}$.\n\nThe lab-frame tensor $T^{\\alpha\\beta}$ is obtained via the transformation $T^{\\alpha\\beta} = \\Lambda^{\\alpha}_{\\alpha'} \\Lambda^{\\beta}_{\\beta'} T'^{\\alpha'\\beta'}$. We compute the relevant components:\n\n$T^{00} = E = (\\Lambda^{0}_{0})^2 T'^{00} + (\\Lambda^{0}_{1})^2 T'^{11} = \\gamma^2 E' + (\\gamma\\beta)^2 (E'/3) = \\gamma^2 E' (1 + \\beta^2/3)$.\n\n$T^{01} = F_x/c = \\Lambda^{0}_{0}\\Lambda^{1}_{0} T'^{00} + \\Lambda^{0}_{1}\\Lambda^{1}_{1} T'^{11} = (\\gamma)(\\gamma\\beta) E' + (\\gamma\\beta)(\\gamma) (E'/3) = \\gamma^2\\beta E'(1 + 1/3) = \\frac{4}{3}\\gamma^2\\beta E'$. By an analogous calculation, $F_y=F_z=0$.\n\n$T^{11} = P_{xx} = (\\Lambda^{1}_{0})^2 T'^{00} + (\\Lambda^{1}_{1})^2 T'^{11} = (\\gamma\\beta)^2 E' + \\gamma^2 (E'/3) = \\gamma^2 E'(\\beta^2 + 1/3)$.\n\n$T^{22} = P_{yy} = (\\Lambda^{2}_{2})^2 T'^{22} = (1)^2(E'/3) = E'/3$.\n\n$T^{33} = P_{zz} = (\\Lambda^{3}_{3})^2 T'^{33} = (1)^2(E'/3) = E'/3$.\n\nAll off-diagonal pressure components $P_{ij}$ ($i\\neq j$) are zero.\n\nThe reduced flux $f$ is defined as $f \\equiv |\\mathbf{F}|/(cE)$. Using our derived expressions:\n$$\nf = \\frac{F_x}{cE} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\gamma^2\\beta E'}{\\gamma^2 E' (1 + \\beta^2/3)} = \\frac{4\\beta/3}{1+\\beta^2/3} = \\frac{4\\beta}{3+\\beta^2}\n$$\nThe physical range of $f$ is $[0, 1]$ for $\\beta \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nThe Eddington factor $\\chi(f)$ is the ratio of the pressure parallel to the flux to the energy density, $\\chi(f) = P_{\\parallel}/E = P_{xx}/E$.\n$$\n\\chi = \\frac{P_{xx}}{E} = \\frac{\\gamma^2 E'(\\beta^2 + 1/3)}{\\gamma^2 E' (1 + \\beta^2/3)} = \\frac{3\\beta^2+1}{3+\\beta^2}\n$$\nTo express $\\chi$ as a function of $f$, we eliminate $\\beta$. From the expressions for $f$ and $\\chi$, we can establish a relationship. Let $X=\\chi$. Then $\\beta^2 = (3X-1)/(3-X)$. Substituting this into the squared expression for $f$:\n$$\nf^2 = \\frac{16\\beta^2}{(3+\\beta^2)^2} = \\frac{16(3X-1)/(3-X)}{(3+(3X-1)/(3-X))^2} = \\frac{16(3X-1)(3-X)}{(9-3X+3X-1)^2} = \\frac{16(9X-3X^2-3+X)}{64} = \\frac{-3X^2+10X-3}{4}\n$$\nThis gives a quadratic equation for $X=\\chi(f)$: $3X^2 - 10X + (3+4f^2) = 0$. Solving for $X$:\n$$\n\\chi(f) = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 12(3+4f^2)}}{6} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 48f^2}}{6} = \\frac{5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{4 - 3f^2}}{3}\n$$\nTo select the correct physical branch, we consider the isotropic limit, $f \\to 0$, where we expect $\\chi \\to 1/3$. The minus sign yields $\\chi(0) = (5 - 2\\sqrt{4})/3 = 1/3$, which is correct. The plus sign gives an unphysical result $\\chi(0)=3$. Thus, the Eddington factor is:\n$$\n\\chi(f) = \\frac{5 - 2\\sqrt{4 - 3f^2}}{3}\n$$\nNext, we express the pressure tensor $\\mathsf{P}$ in terms of $E$, $\\chi(f)$, and the unit flux direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\mathbf{F}/|\\mathbf{F}|$. The tensor must be of the form $P_{ij} = A\\delta_{ij} + B n_i n_j$. In the coordinate system aligned with $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, $P_{xx} = A+B$ and $P_{yy}=P_{zz}=A$. We have two conditions:\n1.  Definition of $\\chi$: $P_{\\parallel} = P_{xx} = \\chi E \\implies A+B = \\chi E$.\n2.  Trace of the stress-energy tensor: The trace $T^\\alpha_\\alpha = E - \\text{tr}(\\mathsf{P})$ is a Lorentz invariant. In the rest frame, $T'^{\\alpha'}}_{\\alpha'} = E' - (P'_{xx}+P'_{yy}+P'_{zz}) = E' - 3(E'/3) = 0$. Thus, $E - \\text{tr}(\\mathsf{P}) = 0$, which means $\\text{tr}(\\mathsf{P}) = P_{xx}+P_{yy}+P_{zz} = E$.\n\nUsing these conditions:\n$(A+B) + A + A = E \\implies 3A+B=E$.\nWe solve the system:\n$3A+B=E$\n$A+B=\\chi E$\nSubtracting the second from the first gives $2A = (1-\\chi)E \\implies A = \\frac{1-\\chi}{2}E$.\nSubstituting $A$ back gives $B = \\chi E - A = \\chi E - \\frac{1-\\chi}{2}E = \\frac{2\\chi-1+\\chi}{2}E = \\frac{3\\chi-1}{2}E$.\nThe pressure tensor is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathsf{P} = E \\left[ \\frac{1-\\chi(f)}{2} \\mathsf{I} + \\frac{3\\chi(f)-1}{2} \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\right]\n$$\nwhere $\\mathsf{I}$ is the identity tensor and $(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{n}})_{ij} = n_i n_j$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nGiven $E=1$ (arbitrary units), $|\\mathbf{F}|=0.6c$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}=(1,0,0)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the reduced flux $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{|\\mathbf{F}|}{cE} = \\frac{0.6c}{c(1)} = 0.6\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the Eddington factor $\\chi(f)$ for $f=0.6$:\n$$\n\\chi(0.6) = \\frac{5 - 2\\sqrt{4 - 3(0.6)^2}}{3} = \\frac{5 - 2\\sqrt{4 - 3(0.36)}}{3} = \\frac{5 - 2\\sqrt{4 - 1.08}}{3} = \\frac{5 - 2\\sqrt{2.92}}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\chi(0.6) \\approx \\frac{5 - 2(1.7088007)}{3} = \\frac{5 - 3.4176014}{3} = \\frac{1.5823986}{3} \\approx 0.5274662\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\chi(0.6) = 0.5275$.\n\nNow we compute the nonzero components of the pressure tensor $\\mathsf{P}$. With $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the components are:\n$P_{xx} = P_{\\parallel} = \\chi E = (0.5274662)(1) = 0.5274662$.\n$P_{yy} = P_{zz} = P_{\\perp} = \\frac{1-\\chi}{2} E = \\frac{1-0.5274662}{2}(1) = \\frac{0.4725338}{2} = 0.2362669$.\nThe off-diagonal components are zero.\n\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$P_{xx} = 0.5275$\n$P_{yy} = 0.2363$\n$P_{zz} = 0.2363$\n\nThe ordered quadruple $(\\chi(f), P_{xx}, P_{yy}, P_{zz})$ is $(0.5275, 0.5275, 0.2363, 0.2363)$.\n\n**Part 3: Comparison with the Diffusion Limit**\n\nThe diffusion approximation is valid in the limit of a nearly isotropic radiation field, i.e., $f \\ll 1$. In this limit, $\\chi \\to 1/3$. The pressure tensor in the diffusion approximation is isotropic:\n$$\n\\mathsf{P}_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{1}{3} E \\mathsf{I}\n$$\nFor $E=1$, this gives $P_{xx} = P_{yy} = P_{zz} = 1/3 \\approx 0.3333$.\n\nComparing our calculated tensor, $\\mathsf{P}_{\\text{M1}}$, with $\\mathsf{P}_{\\text{diff}}$:\n- **Anisotropy:** $\\mathsf{P}_{\\text{M1}}$ is strongly anisotropic, whereas $\\mathsf{P}_{\\text{diff}}$ is isotropic. The M1 closure correctly reflects that a net radiation flux ($f=0.6$ is not small) implies an anisotropic pressure field.\n- **Pressure Components:** In the M1 model, the pressure component parallel to the flux is significantly enhanced ($P_{xx} \\approx 0.5275$ vs $0.3333$), while the perpendicular components are suppressed ($P_{yy}=P_{zz} \\approx 0.2363$ vs $0.3333$). This is physically intuitive: the momentum carried by the radiation stream increases pressure in the direction of flow.\n- **Validity:** The state with $f=0.6$ is far from the diffusion regime. The M1 closure provides a much better physical description of the radiation pressure tensor under these \"semi-transparent\" or \"streaming\" conditions than the simple diffusion approximation, which would make substantial errors in the dynamic coupling between radiation and matter. The M1 closure correctly interpolates between the diffusion limit ($f=0$, $\\chi=1/3$) and the free-streaming limit ($f=1$, $\\chi=1$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5275 & 0.5275 & 0.2363 & 0.2363\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3522603"}, {"introduction": "While the M1 closure is powerful, it is based on the assumption of a single, dominant radiation stream, which is not always the case in astrophysical environments.

First, a general, closed-form expression for the reduced flux $f$ is derived from the first principles given in the problem statement. Second, this formula is applied to the specific case of two equal-intensity beams at a right angle to analyze the behavior of the first moment (M$1$) closure.\n\n**1. Derivation of the General Formula for the Reduced Flux, $f$**\n\nThe problem describes two perfectly collimated, non-interacting radiation beams intersecting at a point. The specific intensity of the combined radiation field, $I(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}})$, can be modeled as the superposition of two Dirac delta functions in angle, representing the two infinitely narrow beams. The total specific intensity is:\n$$\nI(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}) = I_1 \\delta^{(2)}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1) + I_2 \\delta^{(2)}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2)\n$$\nwhere $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the strengths of the beams with propagation directions given by the unit vectors $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2$, respectively. The function $\\delta^{(2)}$ is the Dirac delta function defined on the surface of the unit sphere, with the sifting property $\\int f(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}) \\delta^{(2)}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_0) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = f(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_0)$.\n\nThe problem is set in a two-dimensional plane. We define the direction vectors as:\n- $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1$: along the $x$-axis, so $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1 = (1, 0)^T$.\n- $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2$: rotated by an angle $\\theta$ counterclockwise from $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1$, so $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2 = (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)^T$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the zeroth moment of the radiation field, the radiation energy density $E$, using its definition:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{c} \\int I(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\frac{1}{c} \\int \\left( I_1 \\delta^{(2)}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1) + I_2 \\delta^{(2)}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2) \\right) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega\n$$\nApplying the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, we get:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{c} (I_1 \\cdot 1 + I_2 \\cdot 1) = \\frac{I_1 + I_2}{c}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the first moment, the radiation flux vector $\\boldsymbol{F}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F} = \\int \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} I(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} \\left( I_1 \\delta^{(2)}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1) + I_2 \\delta^{(2)}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2) \\right) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega\n$$\nAgain, using the sifting property, the integral yields the vector sum of the individual beam fluxes:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F} = I_1 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1 + I_2 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2\n$$\nSubstituting the components of the direction vectors:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F} = I_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + I_2 \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} I_1 + I_2 \\cos\\theta \\\\ I_2 \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the reduced flux $f$, we need the magnitude of the flux vector, $\\lVert \\boldsymbol{F} \\rVert$:\n$$\n\\lVert \\boldsymbol{F} \\rVert = \\sqrt{(I_1 + I_2 \\cos\\theta)^2 + (I_2 \\sin\\theta)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lVert \\boldsymbol{F} \\rVert = \\sqrt{I_1^2 + 2 I_1 I_2 \\cos\\theta + I_2^2 \\cos^2\\theta + I_2^2 \\sin^2\\theta}\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1$:\n$$\n\\lVert \\boldsymbol{F} \\rVert = \\sqrt{I_1^2 + I_2^2 + 2 I_1 I_2 \\cos\\theta}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $\\lVert \\boldsymbol{F} \\rVert$ and $E$ into the definition of the reduced flux, $f$:\n$$\nf \\equiv \\frac{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{F} \\rVert}{c E} = \\frac{\\sqrt{I_1^2 + I_2^2 + 2 I_1 I_2 \\cos\\theta}}{c \\left( \\frac{I_1 + I_2}{c} \\right)}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nf(I_1, I_2, \\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{I_1^2 + I_2^2 + 2 I_1 I_2 \\cos\\theta}}{I_1 + I_2}\n$$\nFor the case where $I_1 + I_2 = 0$, which implies $I_1=0$ and $I_2=0$ since intensities are non-negative, the formula leads to an indeterminate form $0/0$. As specified, we define $f=0$ in this degenerate case, which is physically consistent as there is no radiation.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Equal-Intensity, Right-Angle Case**\n\nWe now analyze the special case where $I_1 = I_2 = I_0$ and the beams intersect at a right angle, $\\theta = \\pi/2$. Substituting these values into our general formula for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\sqrt{I_0^2 + I_0^2 + 2 I_0 I_0 \\cos(\\pi/2)}}{I_0 + I_0} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 I_0^2 + 0}}{2 I_0} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} I_0}{2 I_0} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\nSo, for two equal-intensity beams crossing at $90^\\circ$, the M$1$ model predicts a reduced flux of $f = \\sqrt{2}/2 \\approx 0.7071$.\n\nThe M$1$ closure model exhibits artificial beam merging in this configuration. The underlying reason is the loss of information inherent in the moment method. The true radiation field is bimodal, with two distinct propagation directions, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2$. However, the M$1$ model is constructed using only the first two moments: the total energy density $E$ and the net flux vector $\\boldsymbol{F}$. Any set of angular distributions that yield the same $E$ and $\\boldsymbol{F}$ are indistinguishable to the model.\n\nFor the case $I_1=I_2=I_0$ and $\\theta=\\pi/2$:\n- The energy density is $E = (I_0 + I_0)/c = 2I_0/c$.\n- The net flux vector is $\\boldsymbol{F} = I_0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_1 + I_0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_2 = I_0 (1, 0)^T + I_0 (0, 1)^T = I_0(1, 1)^T$.\n\nThe M$1$ closure scheme reconstructs an effective radiation field that matches these two moments. This reconstructed field is inherently unimodal (single-peaked) and is assumed to be symmetric about the direction of the net flux vector $\\boldsymbol{F}$. Consequently, the model incorrectly interprets the two distinct crossing beams as a single, somewhat broader beam propagating in the direction of the vector sum of their fluxes.

This exercise provides the fundamental building block for a time-dependent M1 radiation transport code.", "problem": "You are asked to design and implement a one-dimensional finite-volume discretization for the two-moment radiation transport system with Maximum Entropy (M1) closure. The system evolves the radiation energy density $E$ and radiation flux $F$ in space coordinate $x$ and time $t$, with a prescribed speed of light $c$ and source terms $S_E$ and $S_{F,x}$. The governing hyperbolic system, including sources, is\n$$\n\\partial_t \\begin{pmatrix} E \\\\ F \\end{pmatrix}\n+ \\partial_x \\begin{pmatrix} F \\\\ c^2 P_{xx} \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} c S_E \\\\ S_{F,x} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe radiation pressure tensor contracted along $x$ is $P_{xx}$, which requires a closure relation. In the M1 closure, one introduces the reduced flux $f$ and the Eddington factor $\\chi$ defined by a functional dependence on $f$. In one dimension, the closure reduces to $P_{xx}=\\chi E$, where the directionality aligns with the sign of $F$. The reduced flux is defined by $f=\\lvert F \\rvert/(c E)$, satisfying $0 \\le f \\le 1$ by causality, and $\\chi$ must satisfy $\\chi(0)=1/3$ (the isotropic diffusion limit) and $\\chi(1)=1$ (the free-streaming limit). The system must be discretized on a uniform mesh with cell size $\\Delta x$, and a time increment $\\Delta t$, constructing numerical fluxes at cell interfaces via an Approximate Riemann Solver (ARS). Your discretization must guarantee that characteristic signal speeds do not exceed the speed of light $c$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental base that the propagation speed of radiation moments is bounded by $c$, and that the governing system is hyperbolic with two characteristic fields, you must derive an ARS consistent with these bounds and implement it to compute interface fluxes. A suitable choice is to bound the left and right signal speeds by $s_L=-c$ and $s_R=+c$, producing a two-wave Harten–Lax–van Leer–Einfeldt (HLLE) flux. From the state vector $\\mathbf{Q}=(E,F)^\\top$ and the closure $P_{xx}=\\chi E$ computed from $(E,F)$, the physical flux vector is $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{Q})=(F,\\,c^2 P_{xx})^\\top$.

Angles do not appear in this one-dimensional problem. No percentages shall be used.\n\nTest Suite:\nCompute the HLLE numerical flux for the following four left/right states, each provided as $(E_L,F_L,E_R,F_R)$:\n- Case $1$ (isotropic limit): $(E_L,F_L,E_R,F_R)=(1.0,\\,0.0,\\,1.0,\\,0.0)$.\n- Case $2$ (free-streaming to the right): $(E_L,F_L,E_R,F_R)=(1.0,\\,c,\\,0.5,\\,0.5c)$.\n- Case $3$ (counter-streaming of equal energy): $(E_L,F_L,E_R,F_R)=(1.0,\\,0.5c,\\,1.0,\\,-0.5c)$.\n- Case $4$ (nearly vacuum energy with one-sided flux): $(E_L,F_L,E_R,F_R)=(10^{-12},\\,0.0,\\,10^{-12},\\,c\\times 10^{-12})$.\n\nFor each case, compute the two components of the HLLE numerical flux vector $\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}$:\n- The first component is the energy flux, with unit $\\mathrm{J/(m^2\\,s)}$.\n- The second component is $c^2 P_{xx}$, with unit $\\mathrm{J/(m\\,s^2)}$.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a comma-separated list of $8$ floating-point numbers, ordered as $[\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(1)}_1,\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(2)}_1,\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(1)}_2,\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(2)}_2,\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(1)}_3,\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(2)}_3,\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(1)}_4,\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(2)}_4]$, where the superscript labels the flux component and the subscript labels the case. For example, the output must look like $[x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4]$ with no spaces, where each $x_k$ and $y_k$ is a float in SI units.

It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of radiation transport and moment methods, specifically the M1 closure. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary definitions, constants, and data to compute a unique, meaningful numerical result. The specified units and values are consistent.\n\nThe task is to implement a finite-volume numerical flux for the one-dimensional two-moment radiation transport equations using the Maximum Entropy (M1) closure model. The numerical flux will be computed using the Harten–Lax–van Leer–Einfeldt (HLLE) approximate Riemann solver.\n\nThe governing system of equations evolves the radiation energy density $E$ and the radiation flux $F$:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\begin{pmatrix} E \\\\ F \\end{pmatrix}\n+ \\partial_x \\begin{pmatrix} F \\\\ c^2 P_{xx} \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\mathbf{S}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{S}$ is a source vector, which does not affect the calculation of the numerical flux at cell interfaces. The state vector is $\\mathbf{Q} = (E, F)^\\top$ and the physical flux vector is $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{Q}) = (F, c^2 P_{xx})^\\top$. The speed of light is $c$.\n\nTo solve this hyperbolic system, we first need to define the closure relation that expresses the second moment, the radiation pressure $P_{xx}$, in terms of the evolved moments, $E$ and $F$.\n\n**Radiation Moments and the M1 Closure Relation**\n\nThe moments of the radiation field are defined by angular integrals of the specific intensity $I$. In one dimension, parametrizing the direction by the cosine of the angle with the x-axis, $\\mu \\in [-1, 1]$, the first three moments are:\n- Zeroth moment (radiation energy density): $E = \\frac{2\\pi}{c} \\int_{-1}^{1} I(\\mu) d\\mu$\n- First moment (radiation flux): $F_x \\equiv F = 2\\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} \\mu I(\\mu) d\\mu$\n- Second moment (radiation pressure): $P_{xx} = \\frac{2\\pi}{c} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\mu^2 I(\\mu) d\\mu$\n\nThe system is closed by defining a relationship between $P_{xx}$ and the evolved variables $E$ and $F$. The M1 closure model achieves this by postulating that the specific intensity $I$ is the one that maximizes the radiation entropy, subject to the constraints that it reproduces the given $E$ and $F$. This procedure leads to a unique functional relationship between the Eddington factor $\\chi = P_{xx}/E$ and the reduced flux $f = |F|/(cE)$. The reduced flux is physically constrained by causality, $0 \\le f \\le 1$. The Eddington factor must satisfy the known physical limits: the isotropic diffusion limit, $\\chi(0) = 1/3$, and the free-streaming limit, $\\chi(1) = 1$.\n\nThe result of the maximum entropy derivation for a three-dimensional isotropic system, which is commonly used in one-dimensional codes, gives the following expression for the Eddington factor:\n$$\n\\chi(f) = \\frac{3 + 4f^2}{5 + 2\\sqrt{4 - 3f^2}}\n$$\nThis function correctly reproduces the required limits. We will use this function to compute $P_{xx} = \\chi(f) E$ from the state $(E, F)$.\n\n**The HLLE Approximate Riemann Solver**\n\nFor a finite-volume method, we need a numerical flux $\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}_{i+1/2}$ at the interface between two cells, $i$ and $i+1$, with states $\\mathbf{Q}_L$ and $\\mathbf{Q}_R$, respectively. The HLLE approximate Riemann solver provides such a flux based on estimates for the minimum ($s_L$) and maximum ($s_R$) characteristic signal speeds emerging from the interface. The general formula for the HLLE flux is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}_{\\text{HLLE}} = \\frac{s_R \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{Q}_L) - s_L \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{Q}_R) + s_L s_R (\\mathbf{Q}_R - \\mathbf{Q}_L)}{s_R - s_L}\n$$\nThe characteristic speeds of the radiation moment equations are fundamentally bounded by the speed of light, $c$. Therefore, a simple and robust choice for the signal speed estimates, as specified in the problem, is to take the most dissipative bounds: $s_L = -c$ and $s_R = +c$. This is known as the HLLE-C flux.\n\nSubstituting these speeds into the general formula, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathcal{F}} = \\frac{c \\mathcal{F}_L - (-c) \\mathcal{F}_R + (-c)(c) (\\mathbf{Q}_R - \\mathbf{Q}_L)}{c - (-c)} = \\frac{c(\\mathcal{F}_L + \\mathcal{F}_R) - c^2(\\mathbf{Q}_R - \\mathbf{Q}_L)}{2c}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathcal{F}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathcal{F}_L + \\mathcal{F}_R) - \\frac{c}{2}(\\mathbf{Q}_R - \\mathbf{Q}_L)\n$$\n\n**Computational Algorithm**\n\nTo compute the HLLE numerical flux $\\hat{\\mathcal{F}} = (\\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(1)}, \\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(2)})^\\top$ for a given left state $\\mathbf{Q}_L = (E_L, F_L)^\\top$ and right state $\\mathbf{Q}_R = (E_R, F_R)^\\top$, we perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Read Inputs:** The inputs are the left state $(E_L, F_L)$ and the right state $(E_R, F_R)$, along with the constant $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\n2.  **Compute Reduced Fluxes:** Calculate the reduced flux for the left and right states. To ensure numerical stability for cases where $E$ is very small, we enforce that if $E=0$ then $F=0$ and we define $f=0$. For $E>0$:\n    $$ f_L = \\frac{|F_L|}{c E_L}, \\quad f_R = \\frac{|F_R|}{c E_R} $$\n\n3.  **Compute Eddington Factors:** Using the M1 closure formula, calculate the Eddington factor for each state:\n    $$ \\chi_L = \\chi(f_L) = \\frac{3 + 4f_L^2}{5 + 2\\sqrt{4 - 3f_L^2}}, \\quad \\chi_R = \\chi(f_R) = \\frac{3 + 4f_R^2}{5 + 2\\sqrt{4 - 3f_R^2}} $$\n\n4.  **Compute Physical Fluxes:** Construct the physical flux vectors $\\mathcal{F}_L$ and $\\mathcal{F}_R$:\n    $$ P_{xx, L} = \\chi_L E_L, \\quad P_{xx, R} = \\chi_R E_R $$\n    $$ \\mathcal{F}_L = \\begin{pmatrix} F_L \\\\ c^2 P_{xx, L} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathcal{F}_R = \\begin{pmatrix} F_R \\\\ c^2 P_{xx, R} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n5.  **Compute HLLE Flux Components:** Apply the simplified HLLE formula component by component.\n    - First component (numerical energy flux):\n      $$ \\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}(F_L + F_R) - \\frac{c}{2}(E_R - E_L) $$\n    - Second component (numerical momentum flux, using the definition of $P_{xx}$):\n      $$ \\hat{\\mathcal{F}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{2}(c^2 P_{xx, L} + c^2 P_{xx, R}) - \\frac{c}{2}(F_R - F_L) = \\frac{c^2}{2}(\\chi_L E_L + \\chi_R E_R) - \\frac{c}{2}(F_R - F_L) $$\n\nThis algorithm provides the two components of the numerical flux vector at the interface, which can be used in a finite-volume scheme to update the cell-averaged values of $E$ and $F$ over a time step $\\Delta t$.
