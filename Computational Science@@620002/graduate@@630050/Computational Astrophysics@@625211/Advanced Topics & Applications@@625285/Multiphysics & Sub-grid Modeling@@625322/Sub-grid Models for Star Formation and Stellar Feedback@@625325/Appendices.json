This exercise explores the microscopic physical origins of such a threshold. You will work through a simplified but powerful model connecting the onset of star formation to the transition from atomic (H I) to molecular ($H_2$) gas, a crucial step for gravitational collapse. By deriving the conditions for this transition, you will see how it depends on fundamental environmental parameters like the interstellar radiation field and the gas metallicity, providing a physical justification for commonly used star formation recipes.

Let the slab be chemically steady. Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) forms on dust grains and is photodissociated by FUV photons. Assume the following physically motivated ingredients:\n- The unshielded H$_2$ photodissociation rate per H$_2$ molecule is $D_{0} = \\chi D_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, where $D_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the reference unshielded dissociation rate for $\\chi=1$.\n- Dust attenuates the FUV dissociating photons with an effective absorption cross section per hydrogen nucleus $\\sigma_{d}$, so that the local dissociation rate is $D(N) = D_{0}\\,\\exp(-\\sigma_{d} N)$ at hydrogen nuclei column $N$ measured inward from a slab surface.\n- The H$_2$ formation rate per unit volume on dust is $R_{d}\\,n\\,n_{\\mathrm{HI}}$, where $R_{d}$ is the dust-catalyzed formation coefficient, $n$ is the total hydrogen nuclei number density, and $n_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ is the atomic hydrogen number density.\n- Molecular self-shielding is neglected at the transition depth, so dust shielding dominates the attenuation there.\n- The dust-to-gas ratio scales linearly with metallicity $Z^{\\prime}$ (metallicity relative to Solar), implying $R_{d} = R_{0}\\,Z^{\\prime}$ and $\\sigma_{d} = \\sigma_{d,0}\\,Z^{\\prime}$, where $R_{0}$ and $\\sigma_{d,0}$ are Solar-metallicity reference values.\n\nDefine the transition depth $N_{\\mathrm{HI,trans}}$ (per illuminated face) as the hydrogen nuclei column from the surface to the location where half of the hydrogen nuclei are in molecular form, that is, where $2n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}} = n/2$ and $n_{\\mathrm{HI}} = n/2$.

It is scientifically grounded in established models of the interstellar medium, specifically regarding the photodissociation-regulated formation of molecular hydrogen. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and provides all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters are physically realistic. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must derive an analytic expression for the atomic hydrogen column density at the H I to H$_2$ transition, $N_{\\mathrm{HI,trans}}$, as a function of metallicity $Z^{\\prime}$ and other parameters. Second, we must use this expression to calculate the ratio of star-formation threshold surface densities at two different metallicities.\n\nTo derive the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{HI,trans}}$, we begin with the principle of chemical steady state at the transition depth. This means the rate of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) formation per unit volume must equal its rate of photodissociation per unit volume.\nThe H$_2$ formation rate per unit volume is given as $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{form}} = R_{d}\\,n\\,n_{\\mathrm{HI}}$, where $R_d$ is the formation rate coefficient, $n$ is the total hydrogen nuclei number density, and $n_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ is the atomic hydrogen number density.\nThe H$_2$ photodissociation rate per unit volume is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{diss}} = D(N)\\,n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}$, where $D(N)$ is the local photodissociation rate per H$_2$ molecule and $n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}$ is the molecular hydrogen number density.\n\nIn steady state, $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{form}} = \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{diss}}$:\n$$\nR_{d}\\,n\\,n_{\\mathrm{HI}} = D(N)\\,n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the transition depth, $N_{\\mathrm{HI,trans}}$, as the location where the number of hydrogen nuclei in molecular form is equal to the number of nuclei in atomic form. This is stated as $2n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}} = n_{\\mathrm{HI}}$. Since the total hydrogen nuclei density is $n = n_{\\mathrm{HI}} + 2n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}$, substituting $n_{\\mathrm{HI}} = 2n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}$ gives $n = 2n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}} + 2n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}} = 4n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}}$, which implies $n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}} = n/4$. From this, it follows that $n_{\\mathrm{HI}} = 2(n/4) = n/2$. The provided conditions $n_{\\mathrm{HI}} = n/2$ and $2n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}} = n/2$ (implying $n_{\\mathrm{H_{2}}} = n/4$) are consistent with this definition of the transition point.\n\nAt this transition depth, the total column of hydrogen nuclei from the surface is $N = N_{\\mathrm{HI,trans}}$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand how the pressure floor modifies the Toomre stability parameter $Q$. The effective sound speed is $c_s = \\max(c_{s,0}, c_{s, \\text{floor}})$, where $c_{s, \\text{floor}}$ is the sound speed imposed by the floor.\n\nFirst, let's derive the expression for $c_{s, \\text{floor}}$. The floor is activated to enforce the condition $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{J}} = N_{\\mathrm{J}}\\,\\Delta x$.\nSubstitute the given expression for midplane density $\\rho \\simeq \\Sigma \\Omega / (2 c_s)$ into the Jeans length formula $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{J}} = \\sqrt{\\pi}\\,c_s/\\sqrt{G \\rho}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{J}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,c_s}{\\sqrt{G \\frac{\\Sigma \\Omega}{2 c_s}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,c_s \\sqrt{2 c_s}}{\\sqrt{G \\Sigma \\Omega}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,c_s^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{G \\Sigma \\Omega}} $$\nThe floor condition sets $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{J}} = N_{\\mathrm{J}}\\,\\Delta x$. We can solve for the sound speed this implies, which we call $c_{s, \\text{floor}}$:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{J}}\\,\\Delta x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,c_{s, \\text{floor}}^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{G \\Sigma \\Omega}} $$\n$$ c_{s, \\text{floor}}^{3/2} = N_{\\mathrm{J}}\\,\\Delta x \\frac{\\sqrt{G \\Sigma \\Omega}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} $$\n$$ c_{s, \\text{floor}} = \\left( \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2 \\Delta x^2 G \\Sigma \\Omega}{2\\pi} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nThis is the sound speed when the pressure floor is active. It depends on the local disk properties $\\Sigma$ and $\\Omega$. The floor is active when $c_{s, \\text{floor}} > c_{s,0}$.\n\nNow, let's find the Toomre parameter $Q$ when the floor is active, which we'll call $Q_{\\text{floor}}$. We substitute $c_s = c_{s, \\text{floor}}$ into the definition of $Q$:\n$$ Q_{\\text{floor}} \\equiv \\frac{c_{s, \\text{floor}} \\kappa}{\\pi G \\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{\\pi G \\Sigma} \\left( \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2 \\Delta x^2 G \\Sigma \\Omega}{2\\pi} \\right)^{1/3} \\kappa $$\nUsing $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2}\\Omega$:\n$$ Q_{\\text{floor}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\Omega}{\\pi G \\Sigma} \\left( \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2 \\Delta x^2 G}{2\\pi} \\right)^{1/3} (\\Sigma \\Omega)^{1/3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\Omega}{\\pi G \\Sigma} \\left( \\frac{N_{\\mathrmJ}^2 \\Delta x^2 G}{2\\pi} \\right)^{1/3} \\Sigma^{1/3} \\Omega^{1/3} $$\nCollecting terms:\n$$ Q_{\\text{floor}} = \\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi G} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2 G}{2\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} \\right] \\Delta x^{2/3} \\frac{\\Omega^{4/3}}{\\Sigma^{2/3}} = \\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi G^{2/3}} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2}{2\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} \\right] \\Delta x^{2/3} \\frac{\\Omega^{4/3}}{\\Sigma^{2/3}} $$\nThis expression for $Q_{\\text{floor}}$ shows how stability is modified by the pressure floor.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Applying the pressure floor decreases the midplane sound speed $c_s$ preferentially at low $\\Sigma$, thereby lowering $Q$ and expanding star formation into the outer disk.**\nBy definition, a pressure floor is a *minimum* pressure or, in this isothermal-like setup, a minimum sound speed. The code sets $c_s = \\max(c_{s,0}, c_{s, \\text{floor}})$. Therefore, the pressure floor can only *increase* or maintain the sound speed, never decrease it. The statement that it \"decreases the midplane sound speed\" is incorrect. Furthermore, $c_{s, \\text{floor}} \\propto (\\Sigma \\Omega)^{1/3}$. The product $\\Sigma(R)\\Omega(R) = \\Sigma_0 e^{-R/R_d} (v_c/R)$ is largest at small radii (inner disk, high $\\Sigma$) and smallest at large radii (outer disk, low $\\Sigma$). Thus, the floor is active preferentially at high $\\Sigma$ and $\\Omega$, not low $\\Sigma$. An increase in $c_s$ leads to an increase in $Q \\equiv c_s \\kappa / (\\pi G \\Sigma)$, which *suppresses* star formation. The statement is flawed in every aspect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. When the pressure floor is active, the effective Toomre instability threshold surface density satisfies a scaling of the form $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\propto \\Delta x\\,\\Omega^2/G$ (up to a dimensionless factor set by $N_{\\mathrm{J}}$ and $\\pi$), which tends to suppress star formation where $\\Omega$ is large.**\nThe threshold for instability is $Q < 1$. When the floor is active, we use $Q_{\\text{floor}}$. The critical surface density $\\Sigma_{\\text{crit}}$ is found by setting $Q_{\\text{floor}} = 1$.\nFrom our derived expression for $Q_{\\text{floor}}$:\n$$ 1 = \\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi G^{2/3}} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2}{2\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} \\right] \\Delta x^{2/3} \\frac{\\Omega^{4/3}}{\\Sigma_{\\text{crit}}^{2/3}} $$\nSolving for $\\Sigma_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$ \\Sigma_{\\text{crit}}^{2/3} = \\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi G^{2/3}} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2}{2\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} \\right] \\Delta x^{2/3} \\Omega^{4/3} $$\n$$ \\Sigma_{\\text{crit}} = \\left( \\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi G^{2/3}} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2}{2\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} \\right] \\Delta x^{2/3} \\Omega^{4/3} \\right)^{3/2} = \\left[ \\dots \\right]^{3/2} \\frac{(\\Delta x^{2/3})^{3/2} (\\Omega^{4/3})^{3/2}}{(G^{2/3})^{3/2}} $$\n$$ \\Sigma_{\\text{crit}} \\propto \\frac{\\Delta x \\, \\Omega^2}{G} $$\nThe scaling is correct. The interpretation is that to form stars ($\\Sigma > \\Sigma_{\\text{crit}}$), the surface density must exceed a threshold that scales with $\\Omega^2$. Since $\\Omega$ is large in the inner disk, $\\Sigma_{\\text{crit}}$ is very high there, making it difficult to satisfy the star formation criterion. This suppresses star formation where $\\Omega$ is large. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For a flat rotation curve and exponential $\\Sigma(R)$, the pressure floor can confine star formation to an annulus bounded by radii $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$ defined implicitly by $Q_{\\mathrm{floor}}(R_{\\mathrm{in}})=1$ and $Q_0(R_{\\mathrm{out}})=1$. These have analytic forms $R_{\\mathrm{out}}/R_d = - W(-c_0)$ with $c_0 \\equiv c_{s,0} \\sqrt{2}\\,v_c/(\\pi G \\Sigma_0 R_d)$, and $R_{\\mathrm{in}}/R_d = -2\\,W(-S^{3/4}/2)$ with $S \\equiv K\\,\\Sigma_0^{-2/3} v_c^{4/3} R_d^{-4/3}$ and $K \\equiv \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi G^{2/3}} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{J}}^2 \\Delta x^2}{2 \\pi}\\right)^{1/3}$, where $W$ is the Lambert $W$ function.**\nThe physical picture is correct: the floor stabilizes the inner disk (setting $R_{\\text{in}}$) and the exponential drop in $\\Sigma$ stabilizes the outer disk (setting $R_{\\text{out}}$). We must check the mathematics.\n1.  **Outer Radius $R_{\\text{out}}$**: Set $Q_0(R_{\\text{out}})=1$. $Q_0(R) = \\frac{c_{s,0} \\kappa}{\\pi G \\Sigma} = \\frac{c_{s,0} \\sqrt{2} v_c/R}{\\pi G \\Sigma_0 e^{-R/R_d}} = \\frac{c_{s,0} \\sqrt{2} v_c}{\\pi G \\Sigma_0} \\frac{e^{R/R_d}}{R}$.\n    $1 = \\frac{c_{s,0} \\sqrt{2} v_c}{\\pi G \\Sigma_0 R_d} \\frac{R_d}{R_{\\text{out}}} e^{R_{\\text{out}}/R_d} = c_0 \\frac{e^{R_{\\text{out}}/R_d}}{R_{\\text{out}}/R_d}$. Let $x_{\\text{out}} = R_{\\text{out}}/R_d$. Then $x_{\\text{out}} e^{-x_{\\text{out}}} = c_0$. Let $y = -x_{\\text{out}}$. Then $-y e^y = c_0$, or $y e^y = -c_0$. The solution is $y = W(-c_0)$, so $-x_{\\textrout} = W(-c_0)$, which gives $x_{\\text{out}} = -W(-c_0)$. This matches.\n2.  **Inner Radius $R_{\\text{in}}$**: Set $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R_{\\text{in}})=1$. We defined $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R) = K \\frac{\\Omega^{4/3}}{\\Sigma^{2/3}}$, with $K$ as given in the option. Substituting $\\Omega(R) = v_c/R$ and $\\Sigma(R) = \\Sigma_0 e^{-R/R_d}$:\n    $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R) = K \\frac{(v_c/R)^{4/3}}{(\\Sigma_0 e^{-R/R_d})^{2/3}} = K v_c^{4/3} \\Sigma_0^{-2/3} R^{-4/3} e^{2R/(3R_d)}$.\n    $1 = K v_c^{4/3} \\Sigma_0^{-2/3} R_d^{-4/3} (R_{\\text{in}}/R_d)^{-4/3} e^{2(R_{\\text{in}}/R_d)/3}$. Using $S$ as defined, this is $1 = S (R_{\\text{in}}/R_d)^{-4/3} e^{2(R_{\\text{in}}/R_d)/3}$. Let $x_{\\text{in}} = R_{\\text{in}}/R_d$.\n    $x_{\\text{in}}^{4/3} e^{-2x_{\\text{in}}/3} = S$. Raise to power $3/4$: $x_{\\textin} e^{-x_{\\text{in}}/2} = S^{3/4}$. Let $y = -x_{\\text{in}}/2$, so $x_{\\text{in}} = -2y$.\n    $(-2y)e^{y} = S^{3/4}$, or $y e^y = -S^{3/4}/2$. The solution is $y = W(-S^{3/4}/2)$. So $-x_{\\text{in}}/2 = W(-S^{3/4}/2)$, which gives $x_{\\text{in}} = -2W(-S^{3/4}/2)$. This also matches.\nThe statement is mathematically correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The pressure floor reduces the vertical scale height $H$ and increases the midplane density $\\rho$, thereby enhancing star formation in the inner disk.**\nThe pressure floor *increases* $c_s$ (where active).\nThe scale height is $H \\simeq c_s/\\Omega$. An increase in $c_s$ *increases* $H$.\nThe midplane density is $\\rho \\simeq \\Sigma \\Omega / (2c_s)$. An increase in $c_s$ *decreases* $\\rho$.\nAn increased $c_s$ increases $Q$, which *suppresses* (stabilizes against) star formation.\nEvery claim in this statement is the opposite of what actually happens.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The inner edge $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ of the star-forming annulus decreases as the grid resolution $\\Delta x$ is made finer (smaller), i.e., $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ moves inward with decreasing $\\Delta x$.**\nFrom option C, we have the implicit equation for $R_{\\text{in}}$ which depends on $S$, which in turn depends on $K$, which depends on $\\Delta x$.\n$S \\propto K \\propto (\\Delta x^2)^{1/3} = \\Delta x^{2/3}$.\nSo, a finer (smaller) $\\Delta x$ leads to a smaller value of $S$.\nThe equation for $R_{\\text{in}}$ is $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R_{\\text{in}}) = 1$.\nThe function $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R) \\propto K \\propto \\Delta x^{2/3}$. So decreasing $\\Delta x$ lowers the value of $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R)$ at all radii.\nFor small radii (where $R_{\\text{in}}$ is expected to be), $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R) \\propto R^{-4/3} e^{2R/(3R_d)}$. This function is monotonically decreasing for $R < 2R_d$.\nLet's say for grid size $\\Delta x_1$, we have $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R_{\\text{in},1}, \\Delta x_1) = 1$.\nFor a finer grid $\\Delta x_2 < \\Delta x_1$, the new $Q$ function is $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R, \\Delta x_2) < Q_{\\text{floor}}(R, \\Delta x_1)$ for any fixed $R$.\nIn particular, $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R_{\\text{in},1}, \\Delta x_2) < 1$.\nSince $Q_{\\text{floor}}(R)$ is a decreasing function of $R$ in this regime, to find the new radius $R_{\\text{in},2}$ where $Q_{\\text procrast}(R_{\\text{in},2}, \\Delta x_2) = 1$, we must choose a smaller radius, i.e., $R_{\\text{in},2} < R_{\\text{in},1}$.\nThus, $R_{\\text{in}}$ decreases as $\\Delta x$ decreases. This is a well-known convergence behavior: as resolution improves, the artificial stabilization is reduced, and star formation can occur deeper in the gravitational potential well. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nFinal summary: Options B, C, and E are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "3537989"}, {"introduction": "After stars are born, their feedback in the form of winds and supernovae is a dominant force in shaping galaxies.
