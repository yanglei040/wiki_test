The derivation proceeds from the fundamental principle of energy conservation.\n\nIn a steady-state star, the energy generated within any volume must be equal to the net energy flowing out of that volume. We consider a thin spherical shell of infinitesimal thickness $dr$ at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the star. The volume of this shell is $dV$.\n\n$$dV = 4\\pi r^2 dr$$\n\nThe mass contained within this shell, $dM$, is the product of its volume and the local mass density $\\rho(r)$.\n\n$$dM = \\rho(r) dV = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho(r) dr$$\n\nThe problem states that the nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass, $\\epsilon$, is a constant $\\epsilon_0$ throughout the star. The total energy generated per unit time within this spherical shell, which we can denote as $dE_{\\text{gen}}$, is therefore the product of $\\epsilon_0$ and the mass of the shell $dM$.\n\n$$dE_{\\text{gen}} = \\epsilon_0 dM = \\epsilon_0 \\left( 4\\pi r^2 \\rho(r) dr \\right)$$\n\nThe luminosity $L(r)$ is defined as the net outward energy per unit time crossing a sphere of radius $r$. For a star in a steady state, the energy generated within the shell must be balanced by the difference in luminosity between the shell's outer surface (at radius $r+dr$) and its inner surface (at radius $r$). This difference is $dL = L(r+dr) - L(r)$.\n\nBy the principle of energy conservation:\n\n$$dL = dE_{\\text{gen}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $dE_{\\text{gen}}$, we obtain the differential equation for luminosity as a function of the radial coordinate $r$:\n\n$$\\frac{dL}{dr} = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho(r) \\epsilon_0$$\n\nTo find the luminosity $L(r)$ at a given radius $r$, we must integrate this equation from the center of the star ($r'=0$) to the radius $r$. We use $r'$ as the integration variable to avoid confusion with the upper limit $r$. The boundary condition for this integration is that the luminosity at the center must be zero, $L(0)=0$, as a point of zero volume cannot enclose any energy source.\n\n$$L(r) - L(0) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{dL}{dr'} dr'$$\n$$L(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} 4\\pi r'^2 \\rho(r') \\epsilon_0 dr'$$\n\nSince $\\epsilon_0$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n\n$$L(r) = \\epsilon_0 \\int_{0}^{r} 4\\pi r'^2 \\rho(r') dr'$$\n\nThe integral term in the expression above is the definition of the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius $r$, denoted as $M(r)$:\n\n$$M(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} 4\\pi r'^2 \\rho(r') dr'$$\n\nBy substituting this definition back into the equation for $L(r)$, we arrive at the first required result, which expresses the luminosity profile in terms of the enclosed mass $M(r)$ and the constant energy generation rate $\\epsilon_0$.\n\n$$L(r) = \\epsilon_0 M(r)$$\n\nThis result shows that, for a constant energy generation rate per unit mass, the luminosity at any radius is directly proportional to the mass enclosed within that radius.\n\nNext, we are asked to find the total luminosity of the star, $L(R)$, which is the luminosity at the star's surface ($r=R$). We can find this by evaluating the expression for $L(r)$ at $r=R$.\n\n$$L(R) = \\epsilon_0 M(R)$$\n\nThe mass enclosed at the surface of the star, $M(R)$, is, by definition, the total mass of the star, which is given as $M$.\n\n$$M(R) = M$$\n\nTherefore, the total luminosity of the star is:\n\n$$L(R) = \\epsilon_0 M$$\n\nThis physically intuitive result states that the total energy radiated by the star per unit time is equal to the energy generation rate per unit mass multiplied by the total mass of the star.\n\nThe two derived expressions are $L(r) = \\epsilon_0 M(r)$ and $L(R) = \\epsilon_0 M$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_0 M(r) & \\epsilon_0 M \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3539497"}, {"introduction": "Once energy is generated, it must travel from the core to the surface.
