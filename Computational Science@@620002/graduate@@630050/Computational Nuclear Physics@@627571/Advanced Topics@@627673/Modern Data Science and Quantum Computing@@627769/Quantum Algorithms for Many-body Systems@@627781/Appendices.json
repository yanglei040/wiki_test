It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Minimal Partition into TPC Sets**\n\nThe core of the task is to partition the set of $12$ Pauli strings, which we denote $\\mathcal{P} = \\{P_1, \\ldots, P_{12}\\}$, into the minimum number of disjoint subsets, where each subset is a TPC set. This is a partitioning problem that can be mapped to a graph coloring problem.\n\nLet's define a conflict graph $G = (V, E)$, where the vertices $V$ are the Pauli strings in $\\mathcal{P}$. An edge $(P_i, P_j) \\in E$ exists if the strings $P_i$ and $P_j$ cannot belong to the same TPC set. Two Pauli strings, $P_i = \\otimes_{k=1}^4 \\sigma_i^{(k)}$ and $P_j = \\otimes_{k=1}^4 \\sigma_j^{(k)}$, are in conflict if there exists at least one qubit position $k$ where both have a non-identity operator, but these operators are different. That is, $\\sigma_i^{(k)} \\neq \\sigma_j^{(k)}$ and both $\\sigma_i^{(k)}, \\sigma_j^{(k)} \\in \\{X, Y, Z\\}$.\n\nThe problem of finding a minimal partition of $\\mathcal{P}$ into TPC sets is equivalent to finding the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of the conflict graph $G$, which is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. A lower bound on the chromatic number is the clique number $\\omega(G)$, the size of the largest clique (a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent).\n\nLet's identify a clique in $G$. Consider the first four Pauli strings:\n- $P_1 = X \\otimes X \\otimes I \\otimes I$\n- $P_2 = X \\otimes Y \\otimes I \\otimes I$\n- $P_3 = Y \\otimes X \\otimes I \\otimes I$\n- $P_4 = Y \\otimes Y \\otimes I \\otimes I$\n\nLet's check for conflicts among them:\n- $P_1$ vs $P_2$: Conflict at qubit $2$ ($X$ vs $Y$).\n- $P_1$ vs $P_3$: Conflict at qubit $1$ ($X$ vs $Y$).\n- $P_1$ vs $P_4$: Conflict at qubit $1$ ($X$ vs $Y$) and qubit $2$ ($X$ vs $Y$).\n- $P_2$ vs $P_3$: Conflict at qubit $1$ ($X$ vs $Y$) and qubit $2$ ($Y$ vs $X$).\n- $P_2$ vs $P_4$: Conflict at qubit $1$ ($X$ vs $Y$).\n- $P_3$ vs $P_4$: Conflict at qubit $2$ ($X$ vs $Y$).\n\nEvery pair in the set $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$ is in conflict. Thus, this set forms a $4$-clique in the conflict graph $G$. This implies that the clique number $\\omega(G) \\ge 4$, and therefore the chromatic number $\\chi(G) \\ge 4$. The minimum number of TPC sets required, $N_{\\text{TPC}}$, must be at least $4$.\n\nNow, we need to show that a partition into $4$ sets is possible. If we can construct such a partition, we will have proven that $N_{\\text{TPC}} = 4$. We can attempt to build these four sets, $\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2, \\mathcal{S}_3, \\mathcal{S}_4$, by assigning each member of the $4$-clique to a different set. Let's make an assignment based on the operators on the first two qubits:\n- $\\mathcal{S}_1$ corresponds to a measurement basis with $(X, X, \\dots)$ for qubits $(1,2)$. It contains $P_1$.\n- $\\mathcal{S}_2$ corresponds to a measurement basis with $(X, Y, \\dots)$ for qubits $(1,2)$. It contains $P_2$.\n- $\\mathcal{S}_3$ corresponds to a measurement basis with $(Y, X, \\dots)$ for qubits $(1,2)$. It contains $P_3$.\n- $\\mathcal{S}_4$ corresponds to a measurement basis with $(Y, Y, \\dots)$ for qubits $(1,2)$. It contains $P_4$.\n\nWe now distribute the remaining $8$ Pauli strings into these four sets according to the TPC condition. A term $P = \\sigma^{(1)}\\otimes\\sigma^{(2)}\\otimes\\sigma^{(3)}\\otimes\\sigma^{(4)}$ can be placed in a set with a target measurement basis $(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)$ if for all $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, $\\sigma^{(k)}$ is either $I$ or $p_k$.\n\nLet's try to construct the sets:\n- **Set $\\mathcal{S}_1$ (Basis pattern $X,X, \\dots$):**\n  - We start with $P_1=XXII$.\n  - Which other terms can fit?

The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression or a row matrix of two expressions, as appropriate.", "solution": "The goal is to construct linear estimators of the form\n$$\n\\widehat{E}_{0}^{(p)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)} E(\\lambda_{i}),\n$$\nsuch that the expansion of $\\widehat{E}_{0}^{(p)}$ in powers of $\\lambda$ matches $E_{0}$ up to and including cancellation of error terms through order $p$. This follows from two foundational ingredients:\n\n1) Analytic expansion of the noisy expectation value in the noise strength,\n$$\nE(\\lambda) = E_{0} + c_{1} \\lambda + c_{2} \\lambda^{2} + c_{3} \\lambda^{3} + \\cdots,\n$$\nvalid for sufficiently weak and stationary noise.\n\n2) Linearity of expectation values, permitting linear combinations of measured $E(\\lambda_{i})$ to target cancellation of the low-order terms.\n\nWe choose weights $\\{w_{i}^{(p)}\\}$ to enforce moment-cancellation constraints. Substituting the series into the estimator gives\n$$\n\\widehat{E}_{0}^{(p)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)} \\left(E_{0} + c_{1} \\lambda_{i} + c_{2} \\lambda_{i}^{2} + \\cdots \\right)\n= \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)}\\right) E_{0} + c_{1} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)} \\lambda_{i}\\right)\n+ c_{2} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)} \\lambda_{i}^{2}\\right) + \\cdots.\n$$\nTo ensure $\\widehat{E}_{0}^{(p)} = E_{0} + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^{p+1})$, we impose the linear system of constraints\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)} = 1, \\quad\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)} \\lambda_{i} = 0, \\quad\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)} \\lambda_{i}^{2} = 0, \\ \\ldots, \\\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{(p)} \\lambda_{i}^{p} = 0.\n$$\nFor order $p$, at least $m=p+1$ distinct noise scalings are required to solve these equations.\n\nFirst-order estimator ($p=1$) using $\\lambda \\in \\{1,2\\}$:\nWe take $m=2$ with $\\lambda_{1}=1$ and $\\lambda_{2}=2$.

Substituting into the first gives $-2 w_{2}^{(1)} + w_{2}^{(1)} = 1$, hence $w_{2}^{(1)} = -1$ and $w_{1}^{(1)} = 2$.

Then $w_{2}^{(2)} = -3$, and from the normalization constraint $w_{1}^{(2)} = 1 - w_{2}^{(2)} - w_{3}^{(2)} = 3$.
