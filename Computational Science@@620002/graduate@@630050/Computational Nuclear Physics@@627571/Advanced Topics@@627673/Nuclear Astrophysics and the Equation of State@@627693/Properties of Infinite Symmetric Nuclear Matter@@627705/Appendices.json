The Fermi momentum is related to the nucleon number density $\\rho$ and the spin-isospin degeneracy $g=4$ for symmetric nuclear matter (protons=neutrons, spin-up=spin-down) by:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{g k_F^3}{6\\pi^2} \\implies k_F = \\left( \\frac{6\\pi^2 \\rho}{g} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nThe potential energy, $V_{\\text{HF}}$, at the Hartree-Fock (first-order perturbation theory) level is the expectation value of the two-body potential operator, $\\hat{V} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i \\neq j} V(\\mathbf{r}_i, \\mathbf{r}_j)$, in the ground state of the non-interacting Fermi gas. This ground state, $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$, is a Slater determinant of single-particle plane-wave states $|\\mathbf{k}, \\sigma, \\tau\\rangle$, where $|\\mathbf{k}| \\leq k_F$.\n\nThe expectation value consists of a direct (Hartree) term and an exchange (Fock) term:\n$$\nV_{\\text{HF}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j}^{\\text{occ}} \\left[ \\langle ij | \\hat{V} | ij \\rangle - \\langle ij | \\hat{V} | ji \\rangle \\right]\n$$\nwhere the sum runs over all occupied single-particle states $i$ and $j$. For a uniform system with a central, spin-isospin independent interaction $V(r)$, these terms can be expressed in coordinate space.\n\nThe potential energy per particle, $V_{\\text{HF}}/A$, can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{HF}}}{A} = \\frac{1}{2\\rho} \\left< \\Phi_0 \\left| \\sum_{i \\neq j} V(|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|) \\right| \\Phi_0 \\right> / \\Omega\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the volume. Evaluation in terms of the one-body and two-body density matrices for a uniform system leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{HF}}}{A} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\int d^3r \\, V(r) \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{g} l(k_F r)^2 \\right]\n$$\nThe factor of $1$ inside the bracket corresponds to the direct (Hartree) term, which represents the interaction of a particle with the average density. The term $-\\frac{1}{g} l(k_F r)^2$ is the exchange (Fock) contribution, which arises from the Pauli exclusion principle acting between identical fermions (those with the same spin and isospin). The Slater function, $l(x)$, encodes these Pauli correlations:\n$$\nl(x) = \\frac{3 (\\sin x - x \\cos x)}{x^3} = \\frac{3 j_1(x)}{x}\n$$\nwhere $j_1(x)$ is the spherical Bessel function of the first kind of order one. Note that $\\lim_{x\\to0} l(x) = 1$.\n\nThe spatial integral is spherically symmetric, so $d^3r = 4\\pi r^2 dr$. The final expression for the potential energy per particle is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{HF}}}{A} = 2\\pi \\rho \\int_0^\\infty r^2 V(r;\\Lambda) \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{4} l(k_F r)^2 \\right] dr\n$$\nHere, we have set the degeneracy $g=4$. The interaction $V(r;\\Lambda)$ is given by the sum of a regulated contact potential and a regulated Yukawa potential:\n$$\nV(r;\\Lambda) = V_C(r;\\Lambda) + V_Y(r;\\Lambda) = C_0 \\frac{\\Lambda^3}{\\pi^{3/2}} e^{-(\\Lambda r)^2} - V_0 \\frac{e^{-m_\\pi r}}{r} e^{-(\\Lambda r)^2}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Implementation Strategy\n\nThe total energy per particle, $E/A(\\rho, \\Lambda) = T/A + V_{\\text{HF}}/A$, is computed for each given pair of $(\\rho, \\Lambda)$. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Constants**: All physical constants ($\\hbar c$, $m_N c^2$, $m_\\pi$, etc.) and interaction parameters ($C_0$, $V_0$) are defined in the required units (MeV, fm). The pion mass $m_\\pi$ is converted from MeV to fm$^{-1}$ using $m_\\pi / (\\hbar c)$.\n\n2.  **Fermi Momentum**: For each density $\\rho$, the Fermi momentum $k_F$ is calculated.\n\n3.  **Kinetic Energy**: $T/A$ is computed using the derived $k_F$.\n\n4.  **Potential Energy**: The integral for $V_{\\text{HF}}/A$ is evaluated numerically using `scipy.integrate.quad`. The code correctly implements the derived formula by computing the integral of the function $I(r) = r^2 V(r;\\Lambda) \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{4} l(k_F r)^2 \\right]$ from $r=0$ to $\\infty$. The result of the integration is then multiplied by the prefactor $2\\pi\\rho$ to obtain the final potential energy per particle.\n    To ensure numerical stability, especially at $r \\to 0$:\n    *   The term $r^2 \\times (e^{-m_\\pi r}/r) = r e^{-m_\\pi r}$, which is well-behaved and evaluates to $0$ at $r=0$.\n    *   The Slater function $l(x)$ approaches $1$ as $x \\to 0$. To avoid division by zero, for small arguments $|x| < 10^{-5}$, we use its leading-order Taylor expansion, $l(x) \\approx 1 - x^2/10$. This ensures the integrand is computed accurately near the origin.\n\n5.  **Regulator Sensitivity**: After computing $E/A$ for all nine cases, the results are grouped by density ($\\rho=0.02, 0.16, 0.24$ fm$^{-3}$). For each density, the regulator sensitivity $S(\\rho)$ is calculated using the provided formula:\n    $$\n    S(\\rho) = \\frac{\\max\\{E/A\\}_{\\Lambda} - \\min\\{E/A\\}_{\\Lambda}}{\\left|\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{\\Lambda} E/A \\right|}\n    $$\n\n### Scientific Argument: Regulator Dependence and Three-Nucleon Forces\n\nThe numerical evaluation reveals a non-negligible dependence of the energy per particle $E/A$ on the regulator cutoff $\\Lambda$ at each density. The calculated sensitivity values, $S(\\rho)$, quantify this dependence. For example, at the empirical saturation density $\\rho \\approx 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, the spread in energy due to varying $\\Lambda$ from $1.5$ to $2.5$ fm$^{-1}$ is significant.\n\nThis result highlights a fundamental concept in modern theoretical nuclear physics. The interaction $V(r; \\Lambda)$ is an *effective* interaction, valid only for low-momentum transfers. The cutoff $\\Lambda$ is an unphysical parameter that separates the explicitly resolved low-momentum physics from the unresolved high-momentum physics, whose effects are absorbed into the coupling constants (e.g., $C_0$) of the interaction. A key requirement of a consistent physical theory is that observables, such as the energy of nuclear matter, must be independent of such unphysical regulator parameters. The observed $\\Lambda$-dependence signals that our theoretical model—a Hamiltonian containing only a two-nucleon (2N) force—is incomplete.\n\nThis issue is systematically addressed within the framework of Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\\chi$EFT). $\\chi$EFT provides a hierarchical organization of nuclear forces based on a low-momentum expansion (power counting). Nuclear forces emerge as a sum of 2N, three-nucleon (3N), four-nucleon (4N), and so on, with contributions at increasing orders in the expansion.\n\nAt any given order in the $\\chi$EFT power counting, a consistent calculation must include all contributing operators. Crucially, 3N forces first appear at the same order (next-to-next-to-leading order, N2LO) as some of the refined 2N contributions. When the 2N potential is iterated in a many-body system (as in our Hartree-Fock calculation), it generates cutoff-dependent contributions. The principle of renormalization dictates that these artifacts must be cancelled. It turns out that this cancellation is not achievable by solely refitting the parameters of the 2N force. Instead, the cutoff dependence generated by the 2N force is systematically absorbed and cancelled by the contributions from the consistent 3N force that appears at the same order.\n\nTherefore, the regulator dependence observed in a 2N-only calculation is not a flaw in the concept of effective interactions but an expected consequence of an incomplete (truncated) Hamiltonian. It precisely motivates the necessity of including consistent three-nucleon forces. The parameters of these 3N forces are co-determined with the 2N force parameters and the cutoff $\\Lambda$ to ensure that, order-by-order, physical observables become independent of the regulator, yielding predictive power for nuclear structure and dynamics.
