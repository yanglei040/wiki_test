Mastering the technique explored in this problem ([@problem_id:3546434]) provides a fundamental understanding of the structure and scale of shell-model calculations.", "problem": "Consider the independent-particle nuclear shell model in the full $pf$ shell ($0\\hbar\\omega$ space) built on an inert $^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}$ core for the nucleus $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$. The full $pf$ shell consists of the single-particle orbits $0f_{7/2}$ with $j=7/2$, $1p_{3/2}$ with $j=3/2$, $0f_{5/2}$ with $j=5/2$, and $1p_{1/2}$ with $j=1/2$. The valence configuration thus contains $8$ protons and $8$ neutrons in these orbits. The many-body basis is constructed in the so-called fixed total magnetic quantum number $M$ scheme (the \"$M$-scheme\"), where basis states are Slater determinants specified by occupied single-particle magnetic substates $m_j$ for protons and neutrons.

In your reasoning, outline the combinatorial counting method used to enforce the constraints on $(M,T_z,\\pi)$ from the allowed single-particle $m_j$ values and the Pauli principle. The final answer must be a single integer (no units).", "solution": "The problem asks for the dimension of the many-body basis for the nucleus $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ within the nuclear shell model, subject to specific constraints on total angular momentum projection $M$, parity $\\pi$, and isospin projection $T_z$. The basis is constructed in the $M$-scheme, where basis states are Slater determinants of occupied single-particle states for protons and neutrons.\n\nFirst, we establish the context. The nucleus $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ has $Z=28$ protons and $N=28$ neutrons. With an inert $^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}$ core ($Z=20$, $N=20$), the valence configuration consists of $N_p = 28 - 20 = 8$ protons and $N_n = 28 - 20 = 8$ neutrons occupying the full $pf$ shell. The problem correctly fixes the isospin projection to $T_z = \\frac{N-Z}{2} = \\frac{28-28}{2} = 0$.\n\nThe full $pf$ shell consists of the single-particle orbits $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, $0f_{5/2}$, and $1p_{1/2}$. The parity of a single-particle state is given by $(-1)^l$, where $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. For $f$-orbits, $l=3$, and for $p$-orbits, $l=1$. In both cases, the parity is $(-1)^3 = -1$ and $(-1)^1 = -1$, respectively. Therefore, every single-particle state in the $pf$ shell has negative parity.\n\nThe total parity $\\pi$ of a many-body state is the product of the parities of the occupied single-particle states. The proton configuration consists of $N_p = 8$ particles, so its parity is $\\pi_p = (-1)^{N_p} = (-1)^8 = +1$. Similarly, the neutron configuration consists of $N_n = 8$ particles, so its parity is $\\pi_n = (-1)^{N_n} = (-1)^8 = +1$. The total parity of any configuration of $8$ protons and $8$ neutrons in the $pf$ shell is $\\pi = \\pi_p \\cdot \\pi_n = (+1) \\cdot (+1) = +1$. The problem's constraint of positive parity is therefore automatically satisfied for any possible configuration and does not reduce the dimensionality of the basis.\n\nThe remaining task is to compute the number of states with a total magnetic quantum number $M=28$. The total $M$ is the sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the individual proton and neutron configurations, $M = M_p + M_n$. In the proton-neutron formalism, the total number of states is the product of the number of allowed proton states and neutron states, summed over all possible partitions of $M$:\n$$ \\text{Dim}(M) = \\sum_{M_p} D_p(N_p=8, M_p) \\cdot D_n(N_n=8, M_n=M-M_p) $$\nwhere $D_p$ and $D_n$ are the dimensions of the proton and neutron subspaces, respectively.\n\nGiven the high value of the target $M=28$, it is prudent to first determine the maximum possible value of $M$ for this system. The maximum $M$ for a configuration of $k$ fermions is obtained by placing the particles into the $k$ available single-particle states with the highest magnetic projection quantum numbers $m_j$, respecting the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nLet's list the available single-particle states $(j, m_j)$ for one type of nucleon (e.g., protons), sorted by $m_j$ in descending order. The number of states for each $m_j$ is the number of orbits that can have that $m_j$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $m_j = 7/2$: $1$ state (from $0f_{7/2}$)\n    \\item $m_j = 5/2$: $2$ states (from $0f_{7/2}$, $0f_{5/2}$)\n    \\item $m_j = 3/2$: $3$ states (from $0f_{7/2}$, $0f_{5/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$)\n    \\item $m_j = 1/2$: $4$ states (from $0f_{7/2}$, $0f_{5/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, $1p_{1/2}$)\n\\end{itemize}\nAnd similarly for negative $m_j$ values. To obtain the maximum possible $M$ for $N_p=8$ protons, we occupy the $8$ states with the largest $m_j$ values.\nThe top $1+2+3 = 6$ states are those with $m_j = 7/2$, $m_j = 5/2$, and $m_j = 3/2$. To get $8$ particles, we must also occupy $2$ states from the next level, which consists of $4$ states with $m_j=1/2$.\nThe configuration to achieve the maximum $M_p$ must therefore be:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The $1$ state with $m_j = 7/2$.\n    \\item The $2$ states with $m_j = 5/2$.\n    \\item The $3$ states with $m_j = 3/2$.\n    \\item Any $2$ of the $4$ states with $m_j = 1/2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe sum of the $m_j$ values for such a configuration is:\n$$ M_{p,\\text{max}} = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) + 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7+10+9+2}{2} = \\frac{28}{2} = 14 $$\nThe maximum possible $M$ for $8$ protons is $M_{p,\\text{max}}=14$. Any other configuration of $8$ protons would involve replacing a particle in a state $(j_1, m_{j1})$ from this set with a particle in an unoccupied state $(j_2, m_{j2})$. All unoccupied states have $m_{j2}  m_{j1}$ (or $m_{j2}=m_{j1}$ for a different state at the $m_j=1/2$ level), which means the total $M$ would either decrease or stay the same. Therefore, $14$ is the absolute maximum, and any configuration yielding $M_p=14$ must be of the form described.\n\nThe number of ways to construct a proton state with $M_p = 14$ is the number of ways to choose which $2$ of the $4$ available states with $m_j = 1/2$ are occupied. This is a combinatorial problem:\n$$ D_p(N_p=8, M_p=14) = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6 $$\nIdentical reasoning applies to the $N_n=8$ neutrons. The maximum possible $M$ for the neutron configuration is $M_{n,\\text{max}}=14$, and the number of ways to achieve this is:\n$$ D_n(N_n=8, M_n=14) = \\binom{4}{2} = 6 $$\nNow we return to the total $M$ constraint, $M = M_p + M_n = 28$. Since $M_p \\le M_{p,\\text{max}} = 14$ and $M_n \\le M_{n,\\text{max}} = 14$, the only way for their sum to be $28$ is if both are at their maximum possible values: $M_p = 14$ and $M_n = 14$.\nTherefore, the sum over $M_p$ collapses to a single term:\n$$ \\text{Dim}(M=28) = D_p(N_p=8, M_p=14) \\cdot D_n(N_n=8, M_n=14) $$\nSubstituting the dimensions we calculated:\n$$ \\text{Dim}(M=28) = 6 \\times 6 = 36 $$\nThe dimension of the $M$-scheme basis for $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ in the full $pf$ shell at fixed total $M=28$, $T_z=0$, and positive parity is $36$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{36}$$", "id": "3546434"}, {"introduction": "While the full nuclear interaction is complex, its most important features can often be understood by studying simplified, exactly solvable models.
