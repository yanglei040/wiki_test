The operator mediating this transition is the single-nucleon annihilation operator, $a_{jm}$, which destroys a nucleon in the single-particle state with quantum numbers $(j, m)$.\n\nUsing the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the spectroscopic factor $S_j$ for the removal of a nucleon with angular momentum $j$ can be expressed in terms of the reduced matrix element (RME) of the annihilation operator $a_j$:\n$$ S_j = \\frac{1}{2J_i+1} |\\langle j^{N-1}; \\alpha_f, J_f || a_j || j^N; \\alpha_i, J_i \\rangle|^2 $$\n\nIn this specific problem, we have:\n- The initial state is $|(p_{1/2})^2; v=0, J_i=0\\rangle$.

The seniority scheme provides a powerful framework for evaluating these RMEs.\n\nA standard result from the seniority model, derived from the underlying CFP algebra, gives the value of the squared RME for removing a particle from a state of $n$ particles with seniority $v=0$ (a fully paired state) to produce a state of $n-1$ particles with seniority $v=1$ (a single unpaired particle). The formula for the relevant RME, as given by established shell-model theory (e.g., in I.

The transition from the initial state with seniority $v_i=0$ to the final state with $v_f=1$ represents a change $\\Delta v = 1$, which is an allowed transition. The formula for the RME is specific to this seniority-allowed transition channel.\n\nA consistency check can be performed using the spectroscopic factor sum rule for pickup reactions.

Note that the set of states $\\{ \\lvert f; J_{f} M_{f} \\rangle \\}$ forms a complete orthonormal basis for the $(n-1)$-particle system.\n$$\n\\sum_{f} S_{n\\ell j}(f \\leftarrow i) = \\sum_{f} \\left( \\frac{1}{2J_{i}+1} \\sum_{M_{i},M_{f},m} \\left| \\langle f; J_{f} M_{f} | a_{j m} | i; J_{i} M_{i} \\rangle \\right|^{2} \\right)\n$$\nWe can interchange the order of summation. The sum over $f$ includes a sum over all of its defining quantum numbers, including $J_f$.\n$$\n\\sum_{f} S_{n\\ell j}(f \\leftarrow i) = \\frac{1}{2J_{i}+1} \\sum_{M_{i},m} \\sum_{f,M_{f}} \\left| \\langle f; J_{f} M_{f} | a_{j m} | i; J_{i} M_{i} \\rangle \\right|^{2}\n$$\nThe squared matrix element can be written as a product of the matrix element and its complex conjugate:\n$$\n\\left| \\langle f; J_{f} M_{f} | a_{j m} | i; J_{i} M_{i} \\rangle \\right|^{2} = \\langle i; J_{i} M_{i} | a_{j m}^{\\dagger} | f; J_{f} M_{f} \\rangle \\langle f; J_{f} M_{f} | a_{j m} | i; J_{i} M_{i} \\rangle\n$$\nInserting this into the sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{f} S_{n\\ell j}(f \\leftarrow i) = \\frac{1}{2J_{i}+1} \\sum_{M_{i},m} \\sum_{f,M_{f}} \\langle i; J_{i} M_{i} | a_{j m}^{\\dagger} | f; J_{f} M_{f} \\rangle \\langle f; J_{f} M_{f} | a_{j m} | i; J_{i} M_{i} \\rangle\n$$\nWe now use the completeness relation for the final states, $\\sum_{f,M_{f}} \\lvert f; J_{f} M_{f} \\rangle \\langle f; J_{f} M_{f} \\rvert = \\hat{\\mathbb{I}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbb{I}}$ is the identity operator in the $(n-1)$-particle Hilbert space. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{f} S_{n\\ell j}(f \\leftarrow i) = \\frac{1}{2J_{i}+1} \\sum_{M_{i},m} \\langle i; J_{i} M_{i} | a_{j m}^{\\dagger} a_{j m} | i; J_{i} M_{i} \\rangle\n$$\nThe sum over the magnetic substate $m$ of the product of creation and annihilation operators, $\\sum_{m=-j}^{j} a_{j m}^{\\dagger} a_{j m}$, defines the number operator $\\hat{n}_{j}$ for the orbital $j$.\n$$\n\\hat{n}_{j} = \\sum_{m=-j}^{j} a_{j m}^{\\dagger} a_{j m}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our equation gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{f} S_{n\\ell j}(f \\leftarrow i) = \\frac{1}{2J_{i}+1} \\sum_{M_{i}} \\langle i; J_{i} M_{i} | \\hat{n}_{j} | i; J_{i} M_{i} \\rangle\n$$\nThe number operator $\\hat{n}_{j}$ is a scalar operator, meaning its expectation value is independent of the magnetic quantum number $M_i$ of the state. Therefore, the sum over $M_i$ yields $2J_i+1$ identical terms:\n$$\n\\sum_{f} S_{n\\ell j}(f \\leftarrow i) = \\frac{1}{2J_{i}+1} (2J_{i}+1) \\langle i; J_{i} M_{i} | \\hat{n}_{j} | i; J_{i} M_{i} \\rangle = \\langle \\hat{n}_{j} \\rangle_{i}\n$$\nThis is the general sum rule, stating that the total removal strength is equal to the expectation value of the number operator in the initial state, which is denoted as $n_j$. For a pure configuration $j^n$, the initial state $\\lvert i \\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $\\hat{n}_j$ with eigenvalue $n$. Thus, $\\langle \\hat{n}_j \\rangle_i = n$. The sum rule specializes to:\n$$\n\\sum_{f} S_{n\\ell j}(f \\leftarrow i) = n\n$$\n\nPart 2: Partition of Strength by Seniority\n\nWe are given that seniority $v$ represents the number of nucleons not coupled to angular momentum $J=0$ pairs, and that the single-nucleon annihilation operator $a_{jm}$ induces transitions with a change in seniority $\\Delta v = v' - v = \\pm 1$. The total number of nucleons is $n$, and the number of paired nucleons is $n-v$.\n\nThe process of removing one nucleon via $a_{jm}$ can be pictured in two ways:\n1.  Removing an unpaired nucleon: The initial state has $v$ unpaired nucleons. If we remove one of them, the number of unpaired nucleons in the final $(n-1)$-particle system becomes $v-1$. The number of pairs, $\\frac{n-v}{2}$, remains unchanged. The final seniority is $v' = v-1$. This corresponds to the $\\Delta v = -1$ selection rule.\n2.  Removing a paired nucleon: The initial state has $n-v$ nucleons participating in $J=0$ pairs. If we remove one nucleon from a pair, the pair is broken. The other nucleon of that pair is now unpaired. The final state thus has the original $v$ unpaired nucleons plus this newly unpaired one, for a total of $v+1$ unpaired nucleons. The final seniority is $v' = v+1$. This corresponds to the $\\Delta v = +1$ selection rule.\n\nThe sum rule states the total strength is $n$. This strength must be partitioned between the two possible final seniority classes, $v'=v-1$ and $v'=v+1$. The simplest and most direct interpretation, consistent with the problem's framing, is that the spectroscopic strength for each process is proportional to the number of nucleons available for that process.\n- The strength for transitions to $v' = v-1$ (removing an unpaired nucleon) is proportional to the number of unpaired nucleons, which is $v$.\n- The strength for transitions to $v' = v+1$ (removing a paired nucleon) is proportional to the number of paired nucleons, which is $n-v$.\n\nLet $S_{v \\to v'}$ be the total summed spectroscopic strength for transitions from an initial state of seniority $v$ to all final states of seniority $v'$. We can write:\n$S_{v \\to v-1} = C \\cdot v$\n$S_{v \\to v+1} = C \\cdot (n-v)$\nfor some constant of proportionality $C$.\nFrom the sum rule derived in Part 1, the total strength must be $n$:\n$S_{v \\to v-1} + S_{v \\to v+1} = n$\n$C \\cdot v + C \\cdot (n-v) = C \\cdot n = n$\nThis implies that the constant of proportionality is $C=1$. Therefore, the total strengths to each seniority class are:\n- Total strength to $v' = v-1$: $S_{v \\to v-1} = v$\n- Total strength to $v' = v+1$: $S_{v \\to v+1} = n-v$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the Ratio $R(n)$\n\nWe apply the results from Part 2 to the two specified initial cases to find the total spectroscopic factor to final states with $v'=1$.\n\nCase (i): Initial state is $j^{n}(v=0)$.\nThe initial seniority is $v=0$. This is the fully paired configuration, containing $0$ unpaired nucleons and $n-0=n$ paired nucleons. We are removing one nucleon, so the final state will have $n-1$ nucleons. The possible final seniorities are $v' = v \\pm 1 = 0 \\pm 1$. Since seniority cannot be negative, the only possible final seniority is $v'=1$. This corresponds to a $\\Delta v = +1$ transition.\nThe total strength to $v'=1$ is given by the formula for $S_{v \\to v+1}$ with $v=0$:\n$$S_{j^{n}(v=0) \\to j^{n-1}(v'=1)} = n-v = n-0 = n$$\nPhysically, since all $n$ nucleons are in pairs, removing any one of them must break a pair, leading to a final state with $v'=1$. Thus, the entire strength of $n$ goes to this channel.\n\nCase (ii): Initial state is $j^{n}(v=2)$.\nThe initial seniority is $v=2$. This state has $2$ unpaired nucleons and $n-2$ paired nucleons. The possible final seniorities are $v' = v \\pm 1 = 2 \\pm 1$, which means $v'=1$ or $v'=3$. We are interested in the strength to final states with $v'=1$.\nThe transition $j^{n}(v=2) \\to j^{n-1}(v'=1)$ corresponds to a change $\\Delta v = 1 - 2 = -1$.\nThe total strength for this process is given by the formula for $S_{v \\to v-1}$ with $v=2$:\n$$S_{j^{n}(v=2) \\to j^{n-1}(v'=1)} = v = 2$$\nThis strength of $2$ corresponds to removing one of the two already unpaired nucleons. The remaining strength, $S_{j^{n}(v=2) \\to j^{n-1}(v'=3)} = n-v = n-2$, corresponds to breaking a pair.\n\nNow we compute the ratio $R(n)$:\n$$\nR(n) \\equiv \\frac{\\text{total } S_{n\\ell j} \\text{ for } j^{n}(v=2) \\to j^{n-1}(v'=1)}{\\text{total } S_{n\\ell j} \\text{ for } j^{n}(v=0) \\to j^{n-1}(v'=1)}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nR(n) = \\frac{2}{n}\n$$\n\nPhysical Interpretation:\nIn the $j^{n}(v=0)$ initial state, all $n$ nucleons are in $J=0$ pairs. The removal of any nucleon necessarily breaks a pair, leading to a final state of seniority $v'=1$. The total removal strength, $n$, is therefore entirely concentrated in populating $v'=1$ states.\nIn the $j^{n}(v=2)$ initial state, the nucleons are of two types: $2$ are unpaired, and $n-2$ are paired. Removing one of the $2$ unpaired nucleons leads to a final state with seniority $v'=1$; the strength for this is $2$. Removing one of the $n-2$ paired nucleons breaks a pair and leads to a final state with seniority $v'=3$; the strength for this is $n-2$. The total strength $n$ is thus split between these two channels. The ratio $R(n)=2/n$ compares the absolute strength to the $v'=1$ final states from these two different starting points. It highlights how for a $v=2$ initial state, only a small fraction of the total strength ($2$ out of $n$) populates $v'=1$ states, a process corresponding to removing an 'spectator' unpaired nucleon. The dominant process is breaking an additional pair, which populates $v'=3$ states.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{n}}\n$$", "id": "3591818"}, {"introduction": "In realistic nuclei, the pure configurations of the simple shell model are often mixed by the residual interaction, a phenomenon that has observable consequences.

A one-body shell-model Hamiltonian in a truncated single-particle space is represented by a Hermitian matrix whose diagonal elements are single-particle energies and whose off-diagonal elements encode residual mixing that couples orbitals. In matrix form for a two-orbital subspace, this is a real symmetric matrix. This follows from the standard formulation of quantum mechanics where observable operators are Hermitian.\n\n2. Spectroscopic factors are defined through one-body overlaps between exact many-body states connected by a one-nucleon transfer, and are dimensionless, bounded between zero and one. In a model with an inert core and a single valence nucleon distributed over a small set of single-particle orbitals, the many-body problem reduces to the diagonalization of a finite-dimensional one-body Hamiltonian for the valence space, and the spectroscopic factor to add a nucleon into a basis orbital from the inert core equals the norm of the corresponding component of the normalized eigenstate vector in that basis. This is a direct consequence of second-quantized orthonormality of single-particle states and the definition of the transfer amplitude.\n\n3. A monopole shift acts as a controlled, physically motivated diagonal energy shift of specific orbitals due to changes in the mean field with occupancy. In a parametric study, such a shift can be treated as an external control parameter modifying a chosen orbital’s energy by an amount that you will vary explicitly.

To find the lowest-energy state, $\\lvert \\psi_{\\min}(x) \\rangle$, we must solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation, which in this matrix representation is an eigenvalue problem:\n$$\nH(x) \\lvert \\psi(x) \\rangle = E(x) \\lvert \\psi(x) \\rangle\n$$\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ real symmetric matrix, there will be two real eigenvalues, $E_{\\min}(x)$ and $E_{\\max}(x)$, and a corresponding set of two orthonormal eigenvectors. We are interested in the eigenstate $\\lvert \\psi_{\\min}(x) \\rangle$ associated with the lowest eigenvalue $E_{\\min}(x)$. This eigenstate can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis states:\n$$\n\\lvert \\psi_{\\min}(x) \\rangle = c_a(x) \\lvert a \\rangle + c_b(x) \\lvert b \\rangle\n$$\nThe coefficients $c_a(x)$ and $c_b(x)$ are the components of the normalized eigenvector corresponding to $E_{\\min}(x)$. The normalization condition requires that $\\lvert c_a(x) \\rvert^2 + \\lvert c_b(x) \\rvert^2 = 1$.\n\nThe spectroscopic factor for adding a nucleon into orbital $a$ to reach the final state $\\lvert \\psi_{\\min}(x) \\rangle$ is defined as the square of the overlap integral, which in this model simplifies to $S_a(x) \\equiv \\lvert c_a(x) \\rvert^2$. This quantity, being a squared norm, is dimensionless and represents the probability of finding the system in the configuration described by the basis state $\\lvert a \\rangle$.\n\nThe core of the computational task is to implement an algorithm that, for each given parameter set $(\\epsilon_a, \\epsilon_b, v, h)$, performs the following steps:\n$1$. Define the range of the monopole shift parameter to be evaluated: $x \\in \\{-h, 0, +h\\}$.\n$2$. For each value of $x$ in this set:\n    a. Construct the numerical matrix for the Hamiltonian $H(x)$.\n    b. Diagonalize $H(x)$ to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Standard numerical linear algebra libraries provide robust routines for diagonalizing Hermitian matrices, such as `numpy.linalg.eigh`, which conveniently returns eigenvalues sorted in ascending order and the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors.\n    c. Identify the lowest eigenvalue, $E_{\\min}(x)$, which will be the first element of the sorted list of eigenvalues.\n    d. Extract the corresponding eigenvector, $\\lvert \\psi_{\\min}(x) \\rangle$. Its components, $c_a(x)$ and $c_b(x)$, will form the first column of the eigenvector matrix returned by the diagonalization routine.\n    e. Calculate the spectroscopic factor $S_a(x)$ by squaring the first component of this eigenvector: $S_a(x) = (c_a(x))^2$.\n$3$. After obtaining the three values $S_a(-h)$, $S_a(0)$, and $S_a(+h)$, calculate the local curvature $\\kappa$ of the function $S_a(x)$ at $x=0$. This is estimated using the central second finite difference formula:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{S_a(h) - 2 S_a(0) + S_a(-h)}{h^2}\n$$\nThe units of $\\kappa$ are $\\mathrm{MeV}^{-2}$, as $S_a$ is dimensionless and both $h$ and $x$ are in $\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\nThis procedure is systematically applied to each test case provided in the problem statement. The final output for each case is a collection of the four computed floating-point numbers: $[S_a(-h), S_a(0), S_a(+h), \\kappa]$.
