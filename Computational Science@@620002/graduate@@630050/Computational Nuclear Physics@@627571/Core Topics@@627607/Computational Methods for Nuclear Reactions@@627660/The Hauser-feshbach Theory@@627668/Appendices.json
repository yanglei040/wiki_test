A spin-$s_a$ projectile is incident on a target of spin $I_A$, and the entrance-channel population of compound spin and parity $J,\\pi$ at center-of-mass energy $E$ is to be constructed from the optical-model scattering matrix. Work in the limit where direct-reaction couplings can be neglected so that the absorption encoded by the optical potential represents compound nucleus formation.\n\nIn this problem, take a neutron projectile with spin $s_a = \\tfrac{1}{2}$ and positive intrinsic parity, incident on a spin-zero even-even target with $I_A = 0$ and positive intrinsic parity. Hence the only channel spin is $s = \\tfrac{1}{2}$, and the compound parity is $\\pi = (-1)^{\\ell}$. The entrance-channel optical-model $S$-matrix is diagonal in the $(\\ell,j)$ basis at the given energy $E$, and the transmission coefficient in a partial wave is related to the optical-model scattering matrix by $T_{\\ell j}(E) = 1 - |S_{\\ell j}(E)|^{2}$.

Finally, compute the normalized population probability for the specific compound spin-parity $J^{\\pi} = \\tfrac{3}{2}^{+}$ at the given energy. Express your final answer as a pure number (no units) and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the normalized entrance-channel population probability for a specific compound nucleus state, $J^{\\pi} = \\frac{3}{2}^{+}$, within the Hauser-Feshbach framework using optical-model inputs.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical basis for the calculation. The probability of forming a compound nucleus with a specific total angular momentum $J$ and parity $\\pi$ is proportional to the sum of the reaction cross sections for all entrance channels that can populate this state. The reaction cross section for a given entrance channel partial wave, characterized by orbital angular momentum $\\ell$ and total single-particle angular momentum $j$, is given by the optical model as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\ell j}^{\\text{reac}}(E) = \\pi \\lambda^2 g_j T_{\\ell j}(E)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the reduced de Broglie wavelength of the incident particle, $T_{\\ell j}(E)$ is the transmission coefficient for that partial wave, and $g_j$ is the spin statistical factor. The statistical factor is given by:\n$$\ng_j = \\frac{2j+1}{(2s_a+1)(2I_A+1)}\n$$\nIn this problem, the projectile is a neutron with spin $s_a = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the target is a spin-zero nucleus with $I_A=0$. Therefore, the statistical factor becomes:\n$$\ng_j = \\frac{2j+1}{(2(\\frac{1}{2})+1)(2(0)+1)} = \\frac{2j+1}{2}\n$$\nThe unnormalized entrance-channel formation weight, $W(J^\\pi)$, for a compound state $(J, \\pi)$ is proportional to the sum of the reaction cross sections of all contributing channels. When normalizing to find the population distribution $P(J^\\pi)$, the common factors $\\pi \\lambda^2$ and the denominator $2$ from $g_j$ will cancel. Thus, we can define the unnormalized weight as being proportional to the sum of $(2j+1)T_{\\ell j}$ over all contributing channels.\n\nThe quantum numbers of the compound nucleus, $(J, \\pi)$, are determined by angular momentum and parity conservation laws. The total angular momentum is given by the vector sum $\\vec{J} = \\vec{I_A} + \\vec{j}$. Since $I_A=0$, we have $\\vec{J} = \\vec{j}$, which implies that the compound nucleus spin $J$ is identical to the single-particle total angular momentum $j$. The parity of the compound nucleus is the product of the intrinsic parities of the projectile and target and the orbital parity factor $(-1)^\\ell$. Given that both the neutron (projectile) and the even-even target have positive intrinsic parity, the compound nucleus parity is $\\pi = (+1)(+1)(-1)^\\ell = (-1)^\\ell$.\n\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between an entrance channel $(\\ell, j)$ and the compound nucleus state $(J=j, \\pi=(-1)^\\ell)$ it populates. We can therefore calculate the unnormalized weight for each distinct compound state formed from the given partial waves.

You will implement Moldauer's approximation to calculate the elastic enhancement factor, a phenomenon where the elastic scattering channel is strengthened relative to the predictions of the standard model. This exercise provides insight into how random-matrix theory concepts are used to refine statistical model predictions and improve agreement with experimental data [@problem_id:3602165].", "problem": "Implement a program that computes the compound-nucleus width fluctuation correction (WFC) to the Hauser-Feshbach average using Moldauer’s approximation based on effective channel degrees of freedom in a mathematically explicit way. Begin from the following base: in the statistical model of compound-nucleus reactions, average compound cross sections computed under the Hauser-Feshbach hypothesis assume independent random partial widths. However, correlations among partial widths induce a multiplicative correction factor, the width fluctuation correction (WFC), which enhances the elastic channel relative to the inelastic channels. Assume that the partial widths are independent and that their fluctuations can be captured by effective channel degrees of freedom $\\nu_c$ that depend on the transmission coefficients $T_c \\in (0,1)$. Adopt the standard Moldauer choice for the effective channel degrees of freedom as a function of transmission coefficients, namely $\\nu_c$ being a deterministic function of $T_c$ that respects the weak-absorption limit $T_c \\ll 1$ and the strong-absorption limit $T_c \\to 1$. Your task is to derive, from a first-principles probabilistic construction consistent with random-matrix theory assumptions, an explicit, closed-form expression for the elastic-channel enhancement factor $W_{aa}$ in terms of the effective degrees of freedom $\\nu_c$ and the set of transmission coefficients $\\{T_c\\}$. Then, implement this formula as a program.\n\nRequirements for the derivation and implementation:\n- Start from the assumption that the Hauser-Feshbach baseline arises from independent channel widths and that width fluctuations can be modeled by replacing the Porter-Thomas distribution with a chi-square distribution with effective degrees of freedom $\\nu_c$ for each channel $c$. Model the channel partial width $\\Gamma_c$ as a gamma-distributed random variable with shape parameter proportional to $\\nu_c$ and scale set by the average width, and argue how the normalized partial widths lead to a tractable expectation for the WFC factor.\n- Using that Moldauer’s approximation allows a reduction to an equal-scale surrogate that produces a Dirichlet distribution for the normalized widths, derive a closed-form expression for the multiplicative elastic enhancement factor $W_{aa}$ as a function of the effective shape parameters and the set of $\\{T_c\\}$.\n- Explicitly adopt the widely used Moldauer mapping between transmission coefficients and effective channel degrees of freedom, $\\nu_c = \\frac{2 T_c}{1 - T_c}$, and use it to express your final elastic enhancement $W_{aa}$ formula purely in terms of $\\{T_c\\}$.\n- Your program must compute, for each test case, the elastic enhancement factor $W_{aa}$ for the specified entrance channel index $a$.\n- All outputs are dimensionless real numbers. Express each numerical result rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide code that evaluates the following five independent test cases. Each test case consists of a list of transmission coefficients $\\{T_c\\}$ and an integer index $a$ indicating the entrance channel for which to compute the elastic enhancement $W_{aa}$.\n1. $\\{T_c\\} = [\\,0.2,\\,0.3\\,]$, $a=0$.\n2. $\\{T_c\\} = [\\,0.05,\\,0.9,\\,0.1\\,]$, $a=0$.\n3. $\\{T_c\\} = [\\,0.99,\\,0.4,\\,0.4,\\,0.4,\\,0.4\\,]$, $a=0$.\n4. $\\{T_c\\} = [\\,10^{-6},\\,10^{-6}\\,]$, $a=0$.\n5. $\\{T_c\\} = [\\,0.1,\\,0.1,\\,0.1,\\,0.1,\\,0.1,\\,0.1,\\,0.1,\\,0.1,\\,0.1,\\,0.1\\,]$, $a=3$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the five results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $\"[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5]\"$), where each $x_i$ is the elastic enhancement factor $W_{aa}$ for the corresponding test case, rounded to six decimal places. No other output is permitted.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of the compound-nucleus width fluctuation correction (WFC) factor for the elastic channel, denoted $W_{aa}$, within the statistical model of nuclear reactions. The derivation is to be based on Moldauer's approximation, where partial width fluctuations are modeled using effective channel degrees of freedom, $\\nu_c$.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of the Width Fluctuation Correction\n\nThe average reaction cross section from an entrance channel $a$ to an exit channel $b$ in the Hauser-Feshbach theory is expressed as an average over resonances:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma_{ab} \\rangle \\propto \\left\\langle \\frac{\\Gamma_a \\Gamma_b}{\\Gamma} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma_c$ is the partial width for channel $c$ and $\\Gamma = \\sum_c \\Gamma_c$ is the total width. The standard Hauser-Feshbach formula assumes that the partial widths are statistically independent, leading to an approximation:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma_{ab} \\rangle_{\\text{HF}} \\propto \\frac{\\langle \\Gamma_a \\rangle \\langle \\Gamma_b \\rangle}{\\langle \\Gamma \\rangle}\n$$\nThe Width Fluctuation Correction (WFC) factor, $W_{ab}$, is defined as the ratio of the true average to the Hauser-Feshbach approximation:\n$$\nW_{ab} = \\frac{\\langle \\sigma_{ab} \\rangle}{\\langle \\sigma_{ab} \\rangle_{\\text{HF}}} = \\frac{\\left\\langle \\frac{\\Gamma_a \\Gamma_b}{\\Gamma} \\right\\rangle}{\\frac{\\langle \\Gamma_a \\rangle \\langle \\Gamma_b \\rangle}{\\langle \\Gamma \\rangle}} = \\frac{\\langle \\Gamma \\rangle}{\\langle \\Gamma_a \\rangle \\langle \\Gamma_b \\rangle} \\left\\langle \\frac{\\Gamma_a \\Gamma_b}{\\Gamma} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nFor the elastic channel ($a=b$), this factor, known as the elastic enhancement factor, becomes:\n$$\nW_{aa} = \\frac{\\langle \\Gamma \\rangle}{\\langle \\Gamma_a \\rangle^2} \\left\\langle \\frac{\\Gamma_a^2}{\\Gamma} \\right\\rangle\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Probabilistic Modeling of Partial Widths\n\nThe problem states that the partial width $\\Gamma_c$ for each channel $c$ is modeled as a random variable following a Gamma distribution. This is a generalization of the Porter-Thomas distribution ($\\chi^2$ with one degree of freedom, corresponding to a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $1/2$). The shape of the distribution is determined by the effective number of degrees of freedom, $\\nu_c$. Specifically, $\\Gamma_c$ is modeled as a Gamma-distributed variable with shape parameter $\\alpha_c = \\nu_c/2$.\n\nTo make the calculation of the expectation value tractable, we adopt Moldauer's \"equal-scale surrogate\" approximation. In this approximation, all partial widths $\\Gamma_c$ are assumed to arise from Gamma distributions with different shape parameters $\\alpha_c = \\nu_c/2$ but a *common*, albeit arbitrary, scale parameter $\\theta$.\n$$\n\\Gamma_c \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha_c, \\theta) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\alpha_c = \\nu_c/2\n$$\n\nA key property of independent Gamma-distributed variables with a common scale parameter is that the vector of normalized variables, $x_c = \\Gamma_c / \\sum_j \\Gamma_j$, follows a Dirichlet distribution, and this vector is statistically independent of the total sum $\\Gamma = \\sum_j \\Gamma_j$ (Lukacs's theorem). The parameters of the Dirichlet distribution are the shape parameters of the Gamma distributions:\n$$\n(x_1, x_2, \\ldots) \\sim \\text{Dir}(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots)\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Elastic Enhancement Factor $W_{aa}$\n\nWe can now calculate the term $\\langle \\Gamma_a^2 / \\Gamma \\rangle$ using this probabilistic framework.\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\Gamma_a^2}{\\Gamma} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{(\\Gamma_a/\\Gamma)^2 \\Gamma^2}{\\Gamma} \\right\\rangle = \\langle x_a^2 \\Gamma \\rangle\n$$\nDue to the independence of the normalized vector $(x_c)$ and the sum $\\Gamma$, the expectation splits:\n$$\n\\langle x_a^2 \\Gamma \\rangle = \\langle x_a^2 \\rangle \\langle \\Gamma \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $W_{aa}$:\n$$\nW_{aa} = \\frac{\\langle \\Gamma \\rangle}{\\langle \\Gamma_a \\rangle^2} (\\langle x_a^2 \\rangle \\langle \\Gamma \\rangle) = \\langle x_a^2 \\rangle \\left( \\frac{\\langle \\Gamma \\rangle}{\\langle \\Gamma_a \\rangle} \\right)^2\n$$\nThe entire derivation is performed within the surrogate model. Within this model, the average width of channel $c$ is $\\langle \\Gamma_c \\rangle = \\alpha_c \\theta$.\nThe ratio of the total average width to the average width of channel $a$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\langle \\Gamma \\rangle}{\\langle \\Gamma_a \\rangle} = \\frac{\\sum_c \\langle \\Gamma_c \\rangle}{\\langle \\Gamma_a \\rangle} = \\frac{\\sum_c \\alpha_c \\theta}{\\alpha_a \\theta} = \\frac{\\sum_c \\alpha_c}{\\alpha_a}\n$$\nThe second moment $\\langle x_a^2 \\rangle$ of the Dirichlet distribution is a standard result. For a variable $x_a$ from a $\\text{Dir}(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots)$ distribution, with $\\alpha_0 = \\sum_c \\alpha_c$:\n$$\n\\langle x_a^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\alpha_a (\\alpha_a + 1)}{\\alpha_0 (\\alpha_0 + 1)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the formula for $W_{aa}$:\n$$\nW_{aa} = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_a (\\alpha_a + 1)}{\\alpha_0 (\\alpha_0 + 1)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_0}{\\alpha_a} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\alpha_a (\\alpha_a + 1)}{\\alpha_a^2} \\frac{\\alpha_0^2}{\\alpha_0 (\\alpha_0 + 1)} = \\frac{\\alpha_a + 1}{\\alpha_a} \\frac{\\alpha_0}{\\alpha_0 + 1}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Final Expression in Terms of Physical Parameters\n\nThe final step is to substitute the shape parameters $\\alpha_c = \\nu_c/2$ back into the formula. Let $\\alpha_0 = \\sum_c \\alpha_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_c \\nu_c$.\n$$\nW_{aa} = \\frac{\\nu_a/2 + 1}{\\nu_a/2} \\cdot \\frac{(\\sum_c \\nu_c)/2}{(\\sum_c \\nu_c)/2 + 1}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression, we obtain the closed-form formula for the elastic enhancement factor:\n$$\nW_{aa} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu_a+2}{\\nu_a}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sum_c \\nu_c}{\\sum_c \\nu_c + 2}\\right)\n$$\nTo implement this formula, we use the explicitly provided Moldauer mapping from the transmission coefficients $\\{T_c\\}$ to the effective channel degrees of freedom $\\{\\nu_c\\}$:\n$$\n\\nu_c = \\frac{2 T_c}{1 - T_c}\n$$\nThe transmission coefficients $T_c$ are the inputs to the problem, from which the values for $\\nu_a$ and $\\sum_c \\nu_c$ are calculated, leading to the final value of $W_{aa}$. This formula is valid under the assumptions of the equal-scale surrogate model.\n\n### Algorithm Summary\n1.
