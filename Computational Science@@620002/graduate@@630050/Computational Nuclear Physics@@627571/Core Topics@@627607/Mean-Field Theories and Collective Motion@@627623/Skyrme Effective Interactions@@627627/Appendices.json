It asks for two distinct tasks: first, to derive the mean-field potential corresponding to a given Gaussian density profile, and second, to verify a self-consistency condition related to the stationarity of an auxiliary functional. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary components for its solution are provided.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Mean-Field Potential $U_{t_{0}}(r)$**\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the single-particle mean-field potential, $U_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r})$, as the functional derivative of the energy functional, $E_{t_{0}}[\\rho]$, with respect to the local particle density, $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$.\nThe given energy functional is:\n$$\nE_{t_{0}}[\\rho] = \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r})^{2} \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nThe mean-field potential is thus:\n$$\nU_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\delta E_{t_{0}}}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}\n$$\nThe energy functional $E_{t_{0}}[\\rho]$ is an integral of a function that depends only on the local value of the density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$. Such a functional is called a local or ultralocal functional. For any local functional of the form $E[\\rho] = \\int \\mathcal{E}(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})) d^3\\mathbf{r}$, its functional derivative is simply the partial derivative of the integrand $\\mathcal{E}$ with respect to $\\rho$, evaluated at the local density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$.\nIn our case, the energy density (the integrand) is $\\mathcal{E}_{t_{0}}(\\rho) = \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\rho^{2}$.\nThe functional derivative is therefore:\n$$\nU_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}_{t_{0}}}{\\partial \\rho}\\bigg|_{\\rho=\\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} \\left( \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\rho^{2} \\right) \\bigg|_{\\rho=\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}\n$$\nPerforming the partial differentiation with respect to $\\rho$ as a variable gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} \\left( \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\rho^{2} \\right) = \\frac{t_{0}}{2} (2\\rho) = t_{0}\\rho\n$$\nEvaluating this result at the local density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ yields the general expression for the mean-field potential for any density profile:\n$$\nU_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}) = t_{0} \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe problem specifies that at a particular iteration, the density has a spherically symmetric Gaussian form:\n$$\n\\rho(r) = \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$. Substituting this specific density profile into the general expression for the potential, we obtain the explicit form of $U_{t_{0}}(r)$:\n$$\nU_{t_{0}}(r) = t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the local mean-field potential generated by the $t_{0}$ term for the given Gaussian density.\n\n**Task 2: Verification of the Euler-Lagrange Condition**\n\nThe second task is to verify the stationarity condition $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = 0$ at the self-consistent fixed point for the auxiliary functional:\n$$\nF[\\rho] = E_{t_{0}}[\\rho] - \\int U_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}') \\, \\rho(\\mathbf{r}') \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r}'\n$$\nIn the context of a self-consistent solution, the potential $U_{t_{0}}(\\mathbf{r}')$ appearing in the second term is the one generated by the self-consistent density itself. It is therefore treated as a fixed external field for the purpose of the variation of $F[\\rho]$. We use the expression for $U_{t_{0}}(r)$ derived in the first task. The auxiliary functional, as a functional of a variable density field $\\rho$, is:\n$$\nF[\\rho] = \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r'})^{2} \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r'} - \\int \\left[ t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r'^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\mathbf{r'}) \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r'}\n$$\nWe now compute the functional derivative of $F[\\rho]$ with respect to $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} \\left( \\frac{t_{0}}{2} \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r'})^{2} \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r'} \\right) - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} \\left( \\int \\left[ t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r'^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\mathbf{r'}) \\, d^{3}\\mathbf{r'} \\right)\n$$\nThe first term is the functional derivative we calculated in Task 1, which is $t_{0}\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$. The second term is the functional derivative of a linear functional of the form $\\int f(\\mathbf{r}')\\rho(\\mathbf{r}')d^3\\mathbf{r'}$, which is simply the coefficient function $f(\\mathbf{r})$. In our case, the coefficient function is the fixed self-consistent potential $U_{t_0}(\\mathbf{r})$.\nThus, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = t_{0}\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) - t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe stationarity condition must be checked *at* the self-consistent fixed point, which means we must evaluate this derivative by setting the variable density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ equal to the self-consistent density $\\rho(r) = \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for the derivative gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} \\bigg|_{\\rho(r)=\\rho_0 \\exp(-r^2/b^2)} = t_{0}\\left[ \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) \\right] - t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis result is identically zero for all $\\mathbf{r}$. Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange condition $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = 0$ is explicitly verified for the given density and the potential it generates, confirming the self-consistency of the solution.\n\nThe final answer requested is the expression for $U_{t_0}(r)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{t_{0} \\rho_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3566780"}, {"introduction": "Realistic Skyrme functionals go beyond simple two-body contact interactions by including density-dependent terms, which effectively simulate many-body forces and the influence of the nuclear medium.

Then we recover $x_0 = 1-c_0$ and $x_3 = 1-c_3$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the slope parameter $L$**\n\nFinally, we use all determined parameters ($t_0, t_3, x_0, x_3$) to calculate the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$ using the provided formula:\n$$ L = 2\\,S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho_0) - 3\\,\\rho_0\\,\\frac{(1+2x_0)\\,t_0}{8} - 3\\,\\rho_0\\,\\frac{(1+2x_3)\\,t_3}{48}\\,(\\alpha+1)\\,\\rho_0^{\\alpha} $$\nwhere $S_{\\mathrm{kin}}(\\rho_0) = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{A}\\big|_{\\mathrm{PNM}}(\\rho_0) - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{kin}}}{A}\\big|_{\\mathrm{SNM}}(\\rho_0)$ is calculated at the saturation density $\\rho_0$.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThe following Python code implements this entire procedure.\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the calibration of a simplified Skyrme interaction\n    and calculate the symmetry energy slope L for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Fundamental constants and fixed parameters from the problem statement\n    HBARC_SQ_2M = 20.73553  # MeV * fm^2\n    RHO_0 = 0.16             # fm^-3\n    E_PER_A_0 = -16.0        # MeV\n    ALPHA = 1.0 / 6.0\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {'msm': 1.0, 'rho_qmc': np.array([0.04, 0.08, 0.10]), 'E_qmc': np.array([4.0, 9.5, 12.0])},\n        {'msm': 0.9, 'rho_qmc': np.array([0.04, 0.08, 0.10]), 'E_qmc': np.array([5.0, 11.0, 14.0])},\n        {'msm': 0.7, 'rho_qmc': np.array([0.04, 0.08, 0.10]), 'E_qmc': np.array([6.0, 12.5, 16.0])},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        msm = case['msm']\n        rho_qmc = case['rho_qmc']\n        E_qmc = case['E_qmc']\n\n        # Effective constant for kinetic energy calculations, incorporating m*/m\n        hbarc_sq_2ms = HBARC_SQ_2M / msm\n\n        # --- Step 1: Determine t0 and t3 from SNM saturation conditions ---\n        \n        # Kinetic energy of SNM at saturation density rho_0\n        kF_snm_sq_rho0 = (3 * np.pi**2 * RHO_0 / 2)**(2.0/3.0)\n        Ekin_snm_rho0 = (3.0 / 5.0) * hbarc_sq_2ms * kF_snm_sq_rho0\n\n        # Set up the 2x2 linear system for (t0, t3) based on saturation energy and pressure\n        A_sat = np.zeros((2, 2))\n        b_sat = np.zeros(2)\n\n        A_sat[0, 0] = 3.0 / 8.0 * RHO_0\n        A_sat[0, 1] = 1.0 / 16.0 * RHO_0**(ALPHA + 1)\n        A_sat[1, 0] = 3.0 / 8.0\n        A_sat[1, 1] = (ALPHA + 1) / 16.0 * RHO_0**ALPHA\n\n        b_sat[0] = E_PER_A_0 - Ekin_snm_rho0\n        b_sat[1] = -2.0 / 3.0 * Ekin_snm_rho0 / RHO_0\n        \n        t0, t3 = np.linalg.solve(A_sat, b_sat)\n\n        # --- Step 2: Fit x0 and x3 from PNM data using least squares ---\n\n        # The PNM energy equation is rearranged for a linear fit of c = [1-x0, 1-x3]\n        # This takes the form A_ls * c = b_ls\n        n_points = len(rho_qmc)\n        A_ls = np.zeros((n_points, 2))\n        b_ls = np.zeros(n_points)\n\n        for i, rho in enumerate(rho_qmc):\n            # Kinetic energy of PNM at density rho_i\n            kF_pnm_sq_i = (3 * np.pi**2 * rho)**(2.0/3.0)\n            Ekin_pnm_i = (3.0 / 5.0) * hbarc_sq_2ms * kF_pnm_sq_i\n            \n            # Coefficients for the linear variables (1-x0) and (1-x3)\n            A_ls[i, 0] = 1.0 / 4.0 * t0 * rho\n            A_ls[i, 1] = 1.0 / 24.0 * t3 * rho**(ALPHA + 1)\n            \n            # Target value for the fit (QMC energy minus kinetic energy)\n            b_ls[i] = E_qmc[i] - Ekin_pnm_i\n\n        # Solve the least squares problem for the coefficients c\n        c, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(A_ls, b_ls, rcond=None)\n        oneminus_x0, oneminus_x3 = c[0], c[1]\n        x0 = 1.0 - oneminus_x0\n        x3 = 1.0 - oneminus_x3\n\n        # --- Step 3: Compute the symmetry energy slope parameter L ---\n        \n        # Kinetic part of the symmetry energy at saturation density\n        kF_pnm_sq_rho0 = (3 * np.pi**2 * RHO_0)**(2.0/3.0)\n        Ekin_pnm_rho0 = (3.0 / 5.0) * hbarc_sq_2ms * kF_pnm_sq_rho0\n        Skin_rho0 = Ekin_pnm_rho0 - Ekin_snm_rho0\n\n        # Calculate L using the formula from the problem statement\n        term1_L = 2 * Skin_rho0\n        term2_L = -3 * RHO_0 * t0 * (1 + 2 * x0) / 8.0\n        term3_L = -3 * RHO_0 * t3 * (1 + 2 * x3) * (ALPHA + 1) * RHO_0**ALPHA / 48.0\n        \n        L = term1_L + term2_L + term3_L\n        results.append(f\"{L:.3f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```\nThe program is run, and the output is used to determine the values for the answer.
