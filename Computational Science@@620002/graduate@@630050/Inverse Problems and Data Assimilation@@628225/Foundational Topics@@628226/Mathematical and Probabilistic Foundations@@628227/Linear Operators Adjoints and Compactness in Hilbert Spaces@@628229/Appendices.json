With these conditions, the identity $\\langle Tu, v \\rangle = \\langle u, T^*v \\rangle$ is satisfied, and we can identify the expression for $T^*v$.\nThe expression for the adjoint operator is:\n$$\n(T^*v)(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(a(x)\\frac{dv}{dx}(x)\\right)\n$$\nThe domain $D(T^*)$ consists of functions $v \\in L^2(0,1)$ such that the expression for $T^*v$ is in $L^2(0,1)$ and the boundary conditions $v(0)=0, v(1)=0$ are met. The condition that both $v$ and $-\\frac{d}{dx}(a(x)\\frac{dv}{dx}(x))$ are in $L^2(0,1)$, combined with the fact that $a \\in C^1$ and $a(x)>0$, implies by elliptic regularity theory that $v \\in H^2(0,1)$. The boundary conditions $v(0)=0$ and $v(1)=0$ mean that $v \\in H^1_0(0,1)$. Therefore, the domain of the adjoint is $D(T^*) = H^1_0(0,1) \\cap H^2(0,1)$.\nSince the analytical expression for $T^*$ is identical to that of $T$, and their domains are identical ($D(T^*) = D(T)$), the operator $T$ is self-adjoint.\n\nThe question asks for the analytic expression for $T^*v$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is validated as being self-contained, mathematically sound, and well-posed. We proceed with a step-by-step solution.\n\nThe Hilbert space is $H = L^2(0,1)$ with the inner product $\\langle f,g \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{1} f(s) g(s) ds$. The linear operator $K : H \\to H$ is given by $(K x)(s) = \\int_{0}^{1} x(t) dt$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $K$ is a compact operator and identify its adjoint $K^*$.\nLet $u(s) = 1$ for all $s \\in (0,1)$. The function $u$ is an element of $H$ since $\\int_{0}^{1} u(s)^2 ds = \\int_{0}^{1} 1^2 ds = 1  \\infty$. We can write the operator $K$ using this function and the inner product. For any $x \\in H$, we have:\n$$\n(K x)(s) = \\int_{0}^{1} x(t) \\cdot 1 dt = \\int_{0}^{1} x(t) u(t) dt = \\langle x, u \\rangle.\n$$\nThus, the action of $K$ on $x$ produces the constant function whose value is the scalar $\\langle x, u \\rangle$. We can write this as $(Kx)(s) = \\langle x, u \\rangle u(s)$. This shows that the range of $K$, $\\text{Ran}(K)$, is the one-dimensional subspace of $H$ spanned by the function $u$. An operator whose range is finite-dimensional is called a finite-rank operator. Every finite-rank operator on a Hilbert space is a compact operator. Therefore, $K$ is a compact operator.\n\nTo find the adjoint operator $K^*$, we use the defining relation $\\langle Kx, y \\rangle = \\langle x, K^*y \\rangle$ for all $x, y \\in H$.\nLet's compute the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\langle Kx, y \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{1} (Kx)(s) y(s) ds = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} x(t) dt \\right) y(s) ds.\n$$\nSince the integral with respect to $dt$ is a scalar constant with respect to $s$, we can move it outside the integral with respect to $ds$:\n$$\n\\langle Kx, y \\rangle = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} x(t) dt \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} y(s) ds \\right).\n$$\nUsing the inner product notation with the function $u(s)=1$, this is $\\langle x,u \\rangle \\langle y,u \\rangle$.\nThe right-hand side of the adjoint definition is $\\langle x, K^*y \\rangle$. We require $\\langle x, K^*y \\rangle = \\langle x,u \\rangle \\langle y,u \\rangle$ for all $x \\in H$.\nWe can write this as $\\langle x, K^*y \\rangle = \\langle x, u \\rangle \\langle u, y \\rangle = \\langle x, \\langle u, y \\rangle u \\rangle$.\nThis equality must hold for all $x \\in H$, which implies that $K^*y = \\langle u, y \\rangle u = \\langle y, u \\rangle u$.\nIn integral form, this is $(K^*y)(s) = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} y(t) dt \\right) \\cdot 1$. This is the same definition as the operator $K$. Thus, $K^* = K$, and the operator is self-adjoint.\n\nSecond, we show that the operator $I - K$ is not invertible. An operator is invertible if and only if it is both injective and surjective. We will show it is not injective by finding a non-zero element in its null space (or kernel). Let $x \\in \\ker(I - K)$. By definition, $(I - K)x = 0$, which implies $x - Kx = 0$, or $x = Kx$.\nWriting this out, we have:\n$$\nx(s) = (Kx)(s) = \\int_{0}^{1} x(t) dt.\n$$\nThe right-hand side is a constant, independent of $s$. Let this constant be $c$. Then, the equation implies that any solution must be a constant function, $x(s) = c$. We substitute this form back into the equation to find the value of $c$:\n$$\nc = \\int_{0}^{1} c dt = c \\int_{0}^{1} 1 dt = c \\cdot 1 = c.\n$$\nThis equation, $c=c$, is satisfied for any constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To find a non-zero element of the null space, we can choose any non-zero value for $c$, for example $c=1$. The function $x(s) = 1$ is a non-zero element of $H$ and satisfies $(I-K)x = 0$. Since the null space $\\ker(I-K)$ is non-trivial (it contains all constant functions), the operator $I-K$ is not injective and therefore not invertible. This also shows that $\\lambda=1$ is an eigenvalue of $K$.\n\nThird, we derive the solvability condition for the equation $(I - K)x = y$.\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative theorem for compact operators, the equation $(I - K)x = y$ has a solution for $x \\in H$ if and only if the vector $y$ is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator, $(I - K)^*$.\nThe adjoint of $I-K$ is $(I - K)^* = I^* - K^*$. Since the identity operator $I$ is self-adjoint ($I^*=I$) and we have shown $K$ is self-adjoint ($K^*=K$), we have $(I - K)^* = I - K$.\nTherefore, the solvability condition is that $y$ must be orthogonal to the null space of $I-K$, i.e., $y \\in [\\ker(I-K)]^\\perp$.\nWe have already determined that $\\ker(I-K)$ is the one-dimensional subspace of all constant functions. This subspace is spanned by the function $u(s) = 1$.\nThe orthogonality condition is therefore that $y$ must be orthogonal to every function in $\\ker(I-K)$. It is sufficient to require that $y$ is orthogonal to the basis vector $u(s) = 1$:\n$$\n\\langle y, u \\rangle = 0.\n$$\nIn integral form, the precise solvability condition is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} y(s) ds = 0.\n$$\n\nFourth, we interpret this condition and compute the specified scalar functional. In a data assimilation context, the operator $K$ introduces a constant bias, equal to the mean value. The equation $(I-K)x=y$ asks for a state $x$ whose deviation from its mean value equals the datum $y$. The solvability condition $\\int_0^1 y(s) ds = 0$ signifies that the datum $y$ must have a zero mean. This is a consistency constraint: the datum $y$ cannot itself contain a constant component, as this component lives in the null space of the forward model relating the state deviation to the observation.\n\nThe problem asks to compute the scalar functional $S(y)$ that appears in the solvability condition for the specific datum $y(s) = 2s - 1$. The functional from the condition is $S(y) = \\int_{0}^{1} y(s) ds$. We compute its value for the given $y$:\n$$\nS(y) = \\int_{0}^{1} (2s - 1) ds.\n$$\nThe integration is straightforward:\n$$\nS(y) = \\left[ s^2 - s \\right]_{0}^{1} = (1^2 - 1) - (0^2 - 0) = (1 - 1) - 0 = 0.\n$$\nThe value of the scalar functional for the given datum is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3398478"}]}
