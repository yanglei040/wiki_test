All necessary conditions (governing equation, boundary condition, radiation condition) are provided to ensure a unique and meaningful solution exists. The data and terminology are precise and standard. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\n\nThe total acoustic field $u$ is the superposition of the incident field $u^{\\mathrm{inc}}$ and the scattered field $u^{\\mathrm{scat}}$:\n$$\nu(\\mathbf{x}) = u^{\\mathrm{inc}}(\\mathbf{x}) + u^{\\mathrm{scat}}(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nBoth $u$, $u^{\\mathrm{inc}}$, and $u^{\\mathrm{scat}}$ must satisfy the Helmholtz equation $\\Delta u + k^2 u = 0$ in the exterior of the sphere, $r > a$.\n\nThe incident field is a plane wave propagating along the positive $x_{3}$-axis, $u^{\\mathrm{inc}}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\exp(i k x_{3})$. In spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, where $x_{3} = r \\cos(\\theta)$, this is $u^{\\mathrm{inc}}(r, \\theta) = \\exp(i k r \\cos(\\theta))$. The problem is azimuthally symmetric, so the fields are independent of the angle $\\phi$. To apply the boundary condition on the spherical surface, we expand the incident plane wave in a series of spherical basis functions. This is the Bauer's formula or Faxén-Holtsmark expansion:\n$$\nu^{\\mathrm{inc}}(r, \\theta) = \\exp(i k r \\cos(\\theta)) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} i^{n} (2n+1) j_{n}(kr) P_{n}(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $j_{n}$ are the spherical Bessel functions of the first kind (regular at the origin) and $P_{n}$ are the Legendre polynomials.\n\nThe scattered field $u^{\\mathrm{scat}}$ must also be a solution to the Helmholtz equation. Since it represents a wave propagating outwards from the sphere to infinity, it must satisfy the Sommerfeld radiation condition. A general solution satisfying this condition can be written as a series expansion using spherical Hankel functions of the first kind, $h_{n}^{(1)}$:\n$$\nu^{\\mathrm{scat}}(r, \\theta) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_{n} h_{n}^{(1)}(kr) P_{n}(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThe coefficients $c_{n}$ are unknown constants to be determined by the boundary condition.

The Born-approximated scattered field $u^s_B(x)$ is:\n$$\nu^s_B(x) = -k^2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\frac{\\exp(ik|x-y|)}{4\\pi|x-y|} q(y) \\exp(ik d\\cdot y) d^3y\n$$\nTo find the far-field amplitude $u_\\infty(\\hat x, d)$, we consider the limit $|x|\\to\\infty$.

Here, the operator $\\mathcal{T}$ is defined by $(\\mathcal{T}v)(x) = k^2 \\int_{\\Omega} G_k(x,y) q(y) v(y) \\mathrm{d}y$. This equation has the formal solution $u = (I - \\mathcal{T})^{-1} u^{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n\nWhen the operator norm $\\|\\mathcal{T}\\|$ is less than $1$, we can expand this solution as a Neumann series:\n$$\nu = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{T}^n u^{\\mathrm{i}} = u^{\\mathrm{i}} + \\mathcal{T} u^{\\mathrm{i}} + \\mathcal{T}^2 u^{\\mathrm{i}} + \\dots\n$$\nThe Born approximation, $u^{\\mathrm{B}} = u^{\\mathrm{i}} + \\mathcal{T} u^{\\mathrm{i}}$, retains only the first-order scattering term. The error in this approximation is therefore governed by the second- and higher-order terms, starting with $\\mathcal{T}^2 u^{\\mathrm{i}}$. The magnitude of these terms, and thus the accuracy of the approximation, depends on the norm of $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\nTo estimate $\\|\\mathcal{T}\\|$, we consider its action on a function $v$ in the $L^\\infty(\\Omega)$ norm:\n$$\n\\|\\mathcal{T}v\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} \\left| k^2 \\int_{\\Omega} G_k(x,y) q(y) v(y) \\mathrm{d}y \\right| \\le k^2 \\|q\\|_{\\infty} \\|v\\|_{\\infty} \\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} \\int_{\\Omega} |G_k(x,y)| \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nwhere $|G_k(x,y)| = (4\\pi |x-y|)^{-1}$. The domain $\\Omega$ is a ball of radius $R$. The integral $\\int_{\\Omega} |x-y|^{-1} \\mathrm{d}y$ is maximized for $x$ at the center of the ball, yielding the value $2\\pi R^2$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} \\int_{\\Omega} |G_k(x,y)| \\mathrm{d}y = \\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{|x-y|} \\mathrm{d}y \\le \\frac{1}{4\\pi} (2\\pi R^2) = \\frac{1}{2} R^2\n$$\nThis leads to the bound $\\|\\mathcal{T}\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\frac{1}{2} k^2 R^2 \\|q\\|_{\\infty}$. The dimensionless quantity $\\mu = k^2 R^2 \\|q\\|_{\\infty}$ thus serves as an order-of-magnitude estimate for $\\|\\mathcal{T}\\|$. If $\\mu \\ll 1$, the Neumann series converges rapidly, and the second-order error term, proportional to $\\|\\mathcal{T}\\|^2 \\approx \\mu^2$, is negligible. This justifies $\\mu$ as a predictor for the validity of first-order approximations.\n\n### Numerical Implementation Strategy\n\nThe numerical experiment is conducted by discretizing the continuous equations over a grid of points within the scattering-object's support.\n\n1.  **Discretization**: The support ball of radius $R=0.25$ is discretized using points from a cubic grid with spacing $h=0.125$, retaining only the $N$ points $\\{x_i\\}$ inside the ball. The integral operators are replaced by matrix-vector products with uniform volume element $\\Delta V = h^3$.\n\n2.  **Reference Solution**: The discretized Lippmann-Schwinger equation becomes a linear system for the vector of internal field values $\\mathbf{u} = [u(x_1), \\dots, u(x_N)]^T$:\n    $$\n    (I - k^2 \\Delta V G Q) \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}}\n    $$\n    Here, $I$ is the identity matrix, $G$ is the $N \\times N$ matrix with entries $G_{ij} = G_k(x_i, x_j)$ (for $i \\neq j$, $0$ otherwise), $Q = \\mathrm{diag}(q(x_1), \\dots, q(x_N))$, and $\\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}}$ is the vector of incident field values. This system is solved for the reference field $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\n3.  **Approximate Solutions**:\n    -   The Born internal field is computed directly: $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}} + k^2 \\Delta V G Q \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n    -   The Rytov phase $\\psi_1(x) \\approx u^{\\mathrm{s}}_{\\mathrm{B}}(x) / u^{\\mathrm{i}}(x)$, where $u^{\\mathrm{s}}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the scattered part of the Born field. Discretely, the phase vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_1 = (k^2 \\Delta V G Q \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}}) \\oslash \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}}$, where $\\oslash$ denotes element-wise division. The Rytov field is then $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{R}} = \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}} \\odot \\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_1)$, with $\\odot$ as element-wise multiplication.\n\n4.  **Far-Field and Metrics**:\n    -   The far-field amplitude in the forward direction $\\hat{x}=d$ is computed by a discrete sum:\n        $$\n        u^\\infty(d,d) \\approx \\frac{k^2}{4\\pi} \\Delta V \\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{-\\mathrm{i} k d \\cdot x_j} q_j u_j = \\frac{k^2}{4\\pi} \\Delta V (\\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}})^{\\dagger} Q \\mathbf{u}\n        $$\n        This formula is applied to $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ to get $u^\\infty_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $u^\\infty_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $u^\\infty_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n    -   The relative errors $e_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and $e_{\\mathrm{R}}$ are computed using the provided formula against $u^\\infty_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n    -   The Lippmann-Schwinger residual for an approximate field $\\mathbf{v}$ (either $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ or $\\mathbf{u}_{\\mathrm{R}}$) is calculated as:\n        $$\n        \\mathcal{R}[\\mathbf{v}] = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{i}} - k^2 \\Delta V G Q \\mathbf{v}\\|_2}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2}\n        $$\n        The Euclidean norms $(\\|\\cdot\\|_2)$ are used, as the constant factor $\\sqrt{\\Delta V}$ from the discrete $L^2$ norm cancels in the ratio.\n\nFor each test case, these quantities are computed and compiled into the specified output format.", "answer": "[[0.03125000,0.00161427,0.00161427,0.00161439,0.00161439,0.00000000],[0.62500000,0.08272535,0.08226017,0.08298282,0.08252271,1.00000000],[12.50000000,1.38318361,0.59050964,2.23466138,0.59367295,1.00000000],[0.07500000,0.03260908,0.03260717,0.03260938,0.03260747,1.00000000]]", "id": "3392387"}]}
