It presents a standard, well-posed problem in numerical linear algebra, providing all necessary information and containing no scientific or logical inconsistencies.\n\nThe objective is to construct a Householder reflector $H$ of the form $H = I - \\tau v v^{\\mathsf{T}}$ that transforms a given vector $x$ into a multiple of the first standard basis vector $e_1$. The vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ is given as $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The target vector is $\\alpha e_{1}$, where $e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the value of $\\alpha$. A Householder reflector $H$ is an orthogonal matrix, meaning $H^{\\mathsf{T}}H = I$. A fundamental property of orthogonal transformations is that they preserve the Euclidean norm (length) of a vector. Therefore, it must be that $\\|Hx\\|_2 = \\|x\\|_2$.\nThe Euclidean norm of $x$ is:\n$$ \\|x\\|_2 = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 $$\nThe norm of the target vector $Hx = \\alpha e_1$ is:\n$$ \\|\\alpha e_1\\|_2 = |\\alpha| \\|e_1\\|_2 = |\\alpha| \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = |\\alpha| \\cdot 1 = |\\alpha| $$\nEquating the norms, we get $|\\alpha| = 5$, which implies that $\\alpha$ can be either $5$ or $-5$.\n\nNext, we choose the sign of $\\alpha$ based on the standard convention for numerical stability. The Householder vector, which we will denote as $u$, is constructed from the difference between the original vector $x$ and its target image $\\alpha e_1$. This vector $u$ is normal to the hyperplane of reflection.\n$$ u = x - \\alpha e_1 $$\nA Householder transformation reflects $x$ across the hyperplane orthogonal to $u$. The transformation sends $x$ to $\\alpha e_1$.\nThe vector $u$ is given by:\n$$ u = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 - \\alpha \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor numerical stability, it is crucial to avoid subtractive cancellation when computing the components of $u$. This can occur if we subtract two nearly equal floating-point numbers. In our case, the first component of $u$ is $u_1 = 3 - \\alpha$.\nLet's examine the two possible choices for $\\alpha$:\nIf we choose $\\alpha = 5$, then $u_1 = 3 - 5 = -2$.\nIf we choose $\\alpha = -5$, then $u_1 = 3 - (-5) = 8$.\nThe standard sign convention, designed to prevent loss of precision, is to choose the sign of $\\alpha$ to be the opposite of the sign of the corresponding component of $x$. This choice maximizes the magnitude of that component of $u$. The first component of $x$ is $x_1 = 3$, which is positive. Therefore, we should choose a negative $\\alpha$.\nThe general formula for this choice is $\\alpha = -\\text{sgn}(x_1)\\|x\\|_2$.\nApplying this, we get $\\alpha = -\\text{sgn}(3) \\cdot 5 = -1 \\cdot 5 = -5$.\nThis choice ensures that $x_1$ and $-\\alpha$ are added, maximizing the magnitude of $u_1$ and avoiding cancellation.\n\nWith $\\alpha = -5$, we construct the vector $u$:\n$$ u = x - (-5)e_1 = x + 5e_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + 5 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe Householder matrix is defined by $H = I - 2 \\frac{u u^{\\mathsf{T}}}{u^{\\mathsf{T}}u}$. The problem provides the form $H = I - \\tau v v^{\\mathsf{T}}$. By choosing the vector $v$ in the formula to be our constructed vector $u$, we can find $\\tau$.\nLet $v = u = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThen the formula for $H$ becomes $H = I - \\tau v v^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Comparing this with the standard definition $H = I - 2 \\frac{v v^{\\mathsf{T}}}{v^{\\mathsf{T}}v}$, we identify $\\tau$ as:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{2}{v^{\\mathsf{T}}v} = \\frac{2}{\\|v\\|_2^2} $$\nWe now compute $\\|v\\|_2^2$:\n$$ \\|v\\|_2^2 = v^{\\mathsf{T}}v = 8^2 + 4^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 64 + 16 = 80 $$\nThe value of $\\tau$ is therefore:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{2}{80} = \\frac{1}{40} $$\n\nFinally, we verify by explicit computation that the constructed reflector $H = I - \\frac{1}{40} v v^{\\mathsf{T}}$ maps $x$ to $\\alpha e_1 = -5 e_1$.\n$$ Hx = (I - \\tau v v^{\\mathsf{T}})x = x - \\tau v (v^{\\mathsf{T}}x) $$\nWe first compute the inner product $v^{\\mathsf{T}}x$:\n$$ v^{\\mathsf{T}}x = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = (8)(3) + (4)(4) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 24 + 16 = 40 $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $Hx$:\n$$ Hx = x - \\tau v (40) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{1}{40} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} (40) $$\n$$ Hx = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 - 8 \\\\ 4 - 4 \\\\ 0 - 0 \\\\ 0 - 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis result is exactly $\\alpha e_1 = -5 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which verifies the correctness of our construction.\n\nThe value of $\\tau$ as a simplified rational number is $\\frac{1}{40}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{40}}$$", "id": "3549727"}, {"introduction": "After mastering the construction, we now turn to a crucial conceptual question about the underlying geometry of these transformations.

It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and devoid of ambiguity. The given conditions ($x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\|x\\|_2 = \\|y\\|_2$) and definitions are standard. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nA Householder reflector is a linear transformation $H$ defined by a unit vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ (i.e., $u^\\top u = 1$). The matrix representation of this reflector is given by:\n$$ H = I - 2uu^\\top $$\nwhere $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\nWe are seeking a reflector $H$ such that it maps a given vector $x$ to a given vector $y$, where $\\|x\\|_2 = \\|y\\|_2$. The condition is:\n$$ Hx = y $$\nSubstituting the definition of $H$, we have:\n$$ (I - 2uu^\\top)x = y $$\n$$ x - 2uu^\\top x = y $$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $u$:\n$$ x - y = 2(u^\\top x)u $$\nThis equation is fundamental. It reveals that the vector $x-y$ must be a scalar multiple of the vector $u$. This means that $u$ must be collinear with $x-y$.\n\nWe must analyze two distinct cases.\n\nCase 1: $x = y$\nIn this case, the left side of the equation is the zero vector:\n$$ 0 = 2(u^\\top x)u $$\nSince $u$ is a unit vector, $u \\neq 0$. Therefore, the scalar part must be zero:\n$$ u^\\top x = 0 $$\nThis means that for $H$ to map $x$ to itself ($Hx=x$), the defining vector $u$ must be orthogonal to $x$.\nIf $x$ is the zero vector ($x=0$), then $y=0$ as well, and any Householder reflector satisfies $H0=0$.\nIf $x$ is a non-zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \\ge 2$, the set of all unit vectors $u$ orthogonal to $x$ forms a sphere of dimension $n-2$ within the $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane orthogonal to $x$. This is an infinite set. Consequently, if $x=y \\neq 0$ (and $n \\ge 2$), there are infinitely many Householder reflectors that map $x$ to $y$. If $n=1$ and $x=y \\neq 0$, no such non-zero orthogonal vector $u$ exists, so in this specific trivial case, there is no solution, but typically these problems assume $n>1$.\n\nCase 2: $x \\neq y$\nIn this case, the vector $x-y$ is non-zero. As established, $u$ must be collinear with $x-y$. Since $u$ must be a unit vector, there are only two possibilities for $u$, differing by a sign:\n$$ u = \\frac{x-y}{\\|x-y\\|_2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad u = -\\frac{x-y}{\\|x-y\\|_2} $$\nLet's examine if these two choices for $u$ result in different matrices $H$. Let $u_1 = \\frac{x-y}{\\|x-y\\|_2}$ and $u_2 = -u_1$.\nThe Householder matrix corresponding to $u_1$ is $H_1 = I - 2u_1u_1^\\top$.\nThe Householder matrix corresponding to $u_2$ is $H_2 = I - 2u_2u_2^\\top = I - 2(-u_1)(-u_1)^\\top = I - 2u_1u_1^\\top = H_1$.\nSince the matrix $H$ depends on the outer product $uu^\\top$, the sign of $u$ is irrelevant. Thus, for any pair of distinct vectors $x$ and $y$ with equal norm, there is a unique Householder matrix $H$ that maps $x$ to $y$. This unique matrix is defined by the normal vector $u$ which is uniquely determined up to sign by being parallel to $x-y$.\n\nLet's quickly verify that this choice of $u$ does indeed map $x$ to $y$. Let $\\|x\\|_2^2 = \\|y\\|_2^2 = \\alpha$.\nThe denominator is $\\|x-y\\|_2^2 = (x-y)^\\top(x-y) = x^\\top x - 2x^\\top y + y^\\top y = 2\\alpha - 2x^\\top y$.\nThe product is $u^\\top x = \\left(\\frac{x-y}{\\|x-y\\|_2}\\right)^\\top x = \\frac{x^\\top x - y^\\top x}{\\|x-y\\|_2} = \\frac{\\alpha - x^\\top y}{\\|x-y\\|_2}$.\nThen, $Hx = x - 2u(u^\\top x) = x - 2 \\frac{x-y}{\\|x-y\\|_2} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha - x^\\top y}{\\|x-y\\|_2} \\right) = x - 2 \\frac{(x-y)(\\alpha - x^\\top y)}{\\|x-y\\|_2^2}$.\nSubstituting the expression for the denominator:\n$$Hx = x - 2 \\frac{(x-y)(\\alpha - x^\\top y)}{2(\\alpha - x^\\top y)} = x - (x-y) = y.$$\nThe derivation is correct.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. For $x \\neq y$, there is a unique Householder matrix $H$ that maps $x$ to $y$, given by $H = I - 2 u u^\\top$ with $u = \\dfrac{x - y}{\\|x - y\\|_2}$ (the sign of $u$ does not change $H$). If $x = y$, there are infinitely many such reflectors, namely $H = I - 2 u u^\\top$ for any unit $u$ satisfying $u^\\top x = 0$.\nThis statement accurately reflects our findings for both cases, $x \\neq y$ and $x=y$. It correctly identifies the uniqueness for $x \\neq y$, the formula for $u$, the invariance of $H$ to the sign of $u$, and the condition for the infinite set of solutions when $x=y$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. There are exactly two distinct Householder matrices $H$ that map $x$ to $y$ for $x \\neq y$, corresponding to $u = \\pm \\dfrac{x - y}{\\|x - y\\|_2}$, because the sign of $u$ changes $H$.\nThis is incorrect. The core claim that the sign of $u$ changes $H$ is false, as shown in the derivation: $H = I - 2uu^\\top$ is unchanged when $u$ is replaced by $-u$.

First, it claims the reflector is *always* unique, which is false for the case $x=y$. Second, the formula for $u$ is incorrect for the stated goal. A reflector defined with $u$ proportional to $x+y$ maps $x$ to $-y$, not $y$.\n$$Hx = x - 2\\frac{(x+y)(x+y)^\\top x}{\\|x+y\\|_2^2} = x - 2\\frac{(x+y)(\\|x\\|_2^2+y^\\top x)}{2\\|x\\|_2^2+2y^\\top x} = x-(x+y) = -y.$$\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE.

Here, $x$ and $y$ are linearly dependent. Since $x \\neq y$, the reflector $H$ is unique. This contradicts the statement that if they are linearly dependent, there are infinitely many reflectors.

It is a standard, well-posed question in numerical linear algebra. The solution will proceed by deriving the correct method and evaluating the given options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal of tridiagonalization is to find a similarity transformation that converts a dense matrix into a tridiagonal one, preserving its eigenvalues. For a real symmetric matrix $A$ ($A^{\\mathsf{T}} = A$), the transformation must be orthogonal ($Q^{\\mathsf{T}}Q = I$) to preserve symmetry, since $(Q^{\\mathsf{T}}AQ)^{\\mathsf{T}} = Q^{\\mathsf{T}}A^{\\mathsf{T}}Q = Q^{\\mathsf{T}}AQ$.\n\nFor a complex Hermitian matrix $A$ ($A^{*} = A$), the analogous property to preserve is the Hermitian structure. The class of transformations that preserves eigenvalues and Hermitian structure are unitary similarity transformations. A matrix $U$ is unitary if $U^{*}U=I$. Applying such a transformation $A \\rightarrow U^{*}AU$ preserves the Hermitian property:\n$$\n(U^{*}AU)^{*} = U^{*}A^{*}(U^{*})^{*} = U^{*}AU\n$$\nThis confirms that a sequence of unitary similarity transformations must be used.\n\nThe Householder reflector is the elementary transformation of choice. A real Householder reflector is an orthogonal matrix. Its generalization to the complex space must be a unitary matrix. The complex Householder reflector that maps a vector $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m}$ to a multiple of the first standard basis vector $e_1$ has the form:\n$$\nH = I - \\beta v v^{*}\n$$\nwhere $v \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m}$ is the Householder vector and $\\beta$ is a scalar. For $H$ to be unitary, we require $H^{*}H = I$. First, for $H$ to be Hermitian ($H=H^{*}$), $\\beta$ must be real. Assuming this, we find:\n$$\nH^2 = (I - \\beta v v^{*})(I - \\beta v v^{*}) = I - 2\\beta v v^{*} + \\beta^2 v v^{*} v v^{*} = I - (2\\beta - \\beta^2(v^{*}v))v v^{*}\n$$\nFor $H^2=I$, we need $2\\beta - \\beta^2(v^{*}v) = 0$. For a non-trivial reflection ($\\beta \\neq 0$), this implies $\\beta = \\frac{2}{v^{*}v}$. Thus, the unitary and Hermitian Householder reflector is:\n$$\nH = I - \\frac{2 v v^{*}}{v^{*}v}\n$$\nThe algorithm proceeds in $n-2$ steps. At step $k$ ($k=1, \\dots, n-2$), we aim to introduce zeros in the $k$-th column below the first subdiagonal entry. Let the current matrix be $A_{k-1}$. We consider the subvector $x = A_{k-1}(k+1:n, k)$. We construct an $m \\times m$ ($m=n-k$) Householder reflector $H'_{k}$ to transform $x$. We require $H'_{k}x = \\alpha e_1$. Since $H'_{k}$ is unitary, it preserves the $L_2$-norm, so $|\\alpha| = \\lVert x \\rVert_2$. To avoid numerical instability from subtractive cancellation, $\\alpha$ is chosen to point in the opposite direction of the first component of $x$, $x_1$, in the complex plane. Let $x_1 = |x_1|e^{i\\phi}$. The optimal choice is $\\alpha = -e^{i\\phi}\\lVert x \\rVert_2$. The Householder vector is then $v = x - \\alpha e_1$.\n\nThe full $n \\times n$ transformation matrix is $H_k = \\mathrm{diag}(I_k, H'_{k})$. The matrix is updated via the similarity transformation $A_k = H_k^{*} A_{k-1} H_k$. Since $H_k$ is Hermitian ($H_k^{*} = H_k$), this simplifies to $A_k = H_k A_{k-1} H_k$. This transformation preserves the Hermitian structure of $A_{k-1}$ and introduces the desired zeros in both column $k$ and, by the Hermitian property, row $k$.\n\nAfter $n-2$ steps, the result is a Hermitian tridiagonal matrix $T$. The diagonal entries of any Hermitian matrix must be real. The off-diagonal entries $t_{j,j+1}$ can be complex, but must satisfy $t_{j+1,j} = \\overline{t_{j,j+1}}$. If a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix is required, a final diagonal unitary scaling $D = \\mathrm{diag}(d_1, \\dots, d_n)$ with $|d_i|=1$ can be applied: $T' = D^{*}TD$. The phases of the $d_i$ can be chosen sequentially to make all subdiagonal (and thus superdiagonal) elements real and non-negative.\n\nThe computational cost at each step $k$ is dominated by the update of the lower-right $(n-k) \\times (n-k)$ submatrix. This update can be performed efficiently in $\\mathcal{O}((n-k)^2)$ complex operations. Summing over all steps gives a total complexity of $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-2} c(n-k)^2 = \\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. The arithmetic is complex, so the constant factor is larger than in the real case, but the asymptotic complexity remains $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The algorithm fails because Householder reflectors are only defined over $\\mathbb{R}$. For complex Hermitian matrices, a different class of transformations must be used.**\nThis statement is false.

It correctly identifies the form of the unitary Householder reflector, the numerically stable phase choice for the transformation, the use of a unitary similarity transformation that preserves the Hermitian structure, the nature of the resulting matrix, the optional final scaling step, and the computational complexity. Every detail aligns with the standard algorithm for Hermitian tridiagonalization.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. One must switch to Givens rotations because Householder transformations destroy Hermitian structure in the complex case; using Householder updates would generally produce a non-Hermitian banded matrix.**\nThis statement is false. A unitary similarity transformation $A \\rightarrow H^{*}AH$ with a Hermitian matrix $A$ always preserves the Hermitian property. Householder transformations are designed to be unitary, so they maintain the structure. While complex Givens rotations can also be used for tridiagonalization, the premise that Householder transformations fail is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No changes are required at all: use the same real formulas and transposes, and the result is a real tridiagonal matrix even if $A$ is complex.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple levels. First, one must use complex arithmetic. Second, the matrix transpose $(\\cdot)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ must be replaced by the conjugate transpose $(\\cdot)^{*}$ to ensure transformations are unitary and preserve Hermitian structure. Using the simple transpose on complex vectors does not produce a unitary matrix. Third, the resulting tridiagonal matrix is Hermitian, which means its diagonal is real but its off-diagonals are generally complex. It is not a real tridiagonal matrix without an additional scaling step.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The Householder procedure still works but its computational complexity increases from $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^{4})$ because complex arithmetic requires nested similarity updates.**\nThe premise that the procedure works is correct, but the complexity analysis is wrong. The algorithm's structure remains a sequence of $n-2$ steps, each operating on a shrinking submatrix with a cost proportional to the square of its size. This leads to a total cost of $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. Complex arithmetic only affects the constant pre-factor, not the asymptotic scaling. The term \"nested similarity updates\" is not standard and does not describe a process that would lead to $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ complexity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2401954"}]}
