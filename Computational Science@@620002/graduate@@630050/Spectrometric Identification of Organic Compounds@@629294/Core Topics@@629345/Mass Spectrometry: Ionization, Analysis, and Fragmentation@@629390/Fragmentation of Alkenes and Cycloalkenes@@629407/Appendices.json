The problem is well-posed, self-contained, objective, and provides a clear set of rules and definitions for its solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages as per the problem's requirements.\n\nFirst, we compute the nominal mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) for the specified allylic cations. The problem states that the nominal mass is the integer sum of the nominal atomic masses of the constituent atoms, with $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ as $12$ and $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ as $1$.

For the $\\mathrm{C}_{5}\\mathrm{H}_{9}^{+}$ cation:\n    $$m/z = (5 \\times 12) + (9 \\times 1) = 60 + 9 = 69$$\n\nSecond, we identify the dominant allylic cation fragment for each of the three given $\\mathrm{C}_{6}$ alkene isomers. The fragmentation mechanism is specified as allylic cleavage, which is cleavage of a bond adjacent to the carbon-carbon double bond to produce a resonance-stabilized allylic cation. The favored pathway is the one yielding the most substituted, and therefore most stable, allylic cation.\n\n1.  **$1$-Hexene**: The structure is $\\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3}$. The double bond is between carbons $1$ and $2$. The sole allylic C-C bond is the one between carbon $3$ and carbon $4$. Cleavage of this bond results in the loss of a propyl radical ($\\cdot\\mathrm{C_3H_7}$) and the formation of an allylic cation.\n    $$[\\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3}]^{+\\bullet} \\rightarrow [\\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH_2}]^{+} + \\cdot\\mathrm{CH_2CH_2CH_3}$$\n    The cation formed is the unsubstituted allyl cation, $\\mathrm{C}_{3}\\mathrm{H}_{5}^{+}$. This is a primary allylic cation. Its calculated $m/z$ value is $41$. Therefore, the predicted base peak for $1$-hexene is at $m/z=41$.\n\n2.  **trans-$2$-Hexene**: The structure is $\\mathrm{CH_3-CH=CH-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3}$. The double bond is between carbons $2$ and $3$. There are two allylic positions: carbon $1$ and carbon $4$. The C-C bond cleavage adjacent to the double bond occurs at the C4-C5 bond. Cleavage at this position results in the loss of an ethyl radical ($\\cdot\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$) and the formation of a substituted allylic cation.\n    $$[\\mathrm{CH_3-CH=CH-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3}]^{+\\bullet} \\rightarrow [\\mathrm{CH_3-CH=CH-CH_2}]^{+} + \\cdot\\mathrm{CH_2CH_3}$$\n    The cation formed is $\\mathrm{C}_{4}\\mathrm{H}_{7}^{+}$, which is a secondary allylic cation due to the methyl substituent on the allyl system ($[\\mathrm{CH_3-CH^+-CH=CH_2}] \\leftrightarrow [\\mathrm{CH_3-CH=CH-CH_2^+}]$). Its calculated $m/z$ value is $55$. Therefore, the predicted base peak for trans-$2$-hexene is at $m/z=55$.\n\n3.  **$2,3$-Dimethyl-$2$-butene**: The structure is $(\\mathrm{CH_3})_2\\mathrm{C=C(CH_3)_2}$. The double bond is between carbons $2$ and $3$. All four methyl groups are attached to the carbons of the double bond, making all four C-C single bonds allylic.

According to the problem's premises, this process yields a stable, substituted allylic cation. This fragment corresponds to a tertiary allylic cation (the most stable class), as it is the most substituted allylic system possible from the given options. Its calculated $m/z$ value is $69$. Therefore, the predicted base peak for $2,3$-dimethyl-$2$-butene is at $m/z=69$.\n\nThird, we compute the sum of the nominal $m/z$ values for the three predicted base peaks.\nThe predicted base peak $m/z$ values are:\n- For $1$-hexene: $41$\n- For trans-$2$-hexene: $55$\n- For $2,3$-dimethyl-$2$-butene: $69$\n\nThe sum is:\n$$\\text{Sum} = 41 + 55 + 69 = 165$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be expressed as a single number and rounded to four significant figures.

This problem challenges you to analyze the subtle yet significant differences in the mass spectra of two constitutional isomers, 2-hexene and 3-hexene. You will explore how molecular symmetry and the competition between different allylic cleavage pathways result in a unique distribution of ion intensities, providing a spectral \"fingerprint\" that allows for their differentiation. [@problem_id:3703769]", "problem": "In electron ionization at $70\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, isomeric internal alkenes frequently produce overlapping sets of fragment ions dominated by allylic cations. Consider two constitutional isomers, $2$-hexene and $3$-hexene. In both cases, the initial event is removal of an electron from the $\\pi$-system to form a radical cation $\\mathrm{M}^{+\\cdot}$. From there, fragmentation competes among allylic cleavages adjacent to the $\\mathrm{C{=}C}$ bond, with rates and product distributions governed by the number of symmetry-equivalent cleavage pathways, the relative stabilities of departing radicals, and the resonance stabilization of the resulting carbocations. The most intense ions in such spectra typically appear near $m/z=41$ (the allyl cation $\\mathrm{C_3H_5^+}$), $m/z=55$ (the butenyl/allylic cation $\\mathrm{C_4H_7^+}$), and $m/z=69$ (the pentenyl/allylic cation $\\mathrm{C_5H_9^+}$), among others.\n\nSelect all options that supply a mechanistically sound explanation for why $3$-hexene may yield many of the same nominal fragment ions as $2$-hexene but with altered relative intensities, and that also propose quantitative, experimentally actionable criteria to distinguish the isomers under controlled Electron Ionization (EI) conditions using only their fragmentation patterns. Your evaluation should be based on first principles of radical cation formation, allylic cleavage, resonance stabilization, and statistical degeneracy of fragmentation pathways, and it should not rely on any specialized functional groups absent from simple alkenes. Assume unit-mass resolution and spectra acquired at $70\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ with comparable ion source conditions and normalization of peak intensities to the base peak.\n\nA. In EI, both isomers form $\\mathrm{M}^{+\\cdot}$ centered on the $\\pi$-bond, after which allylic cleavages dominate. For $3$-hexene (Et-CH=CH-Et), both bonds adjacent to the double bond are equivalent; each allylic scission expels an ethyl radical ($\\mathrm{C_2H_5^\\cdot}$, mass $29$) to give the same $\\mathrm{C_4H_7^+}$ at $m/z=55$. The two symmetry-equivalent channels statistically enhance $I(55)$. For $2$-hexene (Me-CH=CH-Pr), the two allylic scissions are nondegenerate: loss of a propyl radical ($\\mathrm{C_3H_7^\\cdot}$, mass $43$) yields $\\mathrm{C_3H_5^+}$ at $m/z=41$, and loss of a methyl radical ($\\mathrm{CH_3^\\cdot}$, mass $15$) yields $\\mathrm{C_5H_9^+}$ at $m/z=69$. Consequently, $2$-hexene distributes intensity between $m/z=41$ and $m/z=69$, whereas $3$-hexene concentrates intensity at $m/z=55$. A practical discriminator at $70\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ is to use two independent ratios with decision thresholds reflecting this degeneracy and channel competition: classify a spectrum as $3$-hexene if $I(55)/I(41)\\ge 1.6$ and $I(69)/I(55)\\le 0.30$, and as $2$-hexene if $I(55)/I(41)\\le 0.90$ and $I(69)/I(55)\\ge 0.50$. Spectra failing both sets fall into an ambiguity window requiring additional evidence.\n\nB. The different fragment intensities arise from a McLafferty rearrangement involving a $\\gamma$-hydrogen transfer to the double bond. Therefore, the presence of a dominant $m/z=56$ peak is diagnostic for $3$-hexene; require $I(56)/I(55)\\ge 1.2$ to assign $3$-hexene and $I(56)/I(55)\\le 0.5$ to assign $2$-hexene.\n\nC. Because $3$-hexene is symmetric, it must always show a larger propyl cation at $m/z=43$ than $2$-hexene; thus, use $I(43)/I(41)>1.5$ to assign $3$-hexene and $I(43)/I(41)<0.8$ to assign $2$-hexene. The mechanistic basis is that the symmetric radical cation delocalizes charge to favor homolytic cleavage producing $\\mathrm{C_3H_7^+}$.\n\nD. The molecular ions of $2$-hexene and $3$-hexene have different exact masses due to distinct bonding patterns and thus can be separated by high-resolution mass spectrometry. A quantitative criterion is an exact mass difference of at least $2\\ \\mathrm{mDa}$ between the two $\\mathrm{M}^{+\\cdot}$ peaks at nominal $m/z=84$.\n\nE. The principal difference is that $3$-hexene undergoes preferential cyclopropylcarbinyl to allylic rearrangement, uniquely producing a dominant saturated butyl cation at $m/z=57$. Therefore, if $I(57)/I(55)\\ge 1.0$, assign $3$-hexene; otherwise assign $2$-hexene.", "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of different mechanistic proposals to distinguish the constitutional isomers $2$-hexene and $3$-hexene by their electron ionization (EI) mass spectra. The solution involves analyzing the expected fragmentation patterns based on the principles of allylic cleavage, molecular symmetry, and rearrangement reactions.\n\n**Analysis of 3-Hexene ($\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2-CH=CH-CH_2CH_3}$):**\nThis molecule is symmetric around the central $\\mathrm{C=C}$ bond. In mass spectrometry, the fragmentation of internal alkenes is complex. One of the most prominent fragments for 3-hexene is observed at $m/z$ 55, corresponding to the loss of an ethyl radical ($\\cdot\\mathrm{C_2H_5}$). Although this cleavage is vinylic to the original double bond position, it is a very common pathway. Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are two equivalent ways to lose an ethyl radical, which statistically enhances the intensity of the resulting $\\mathrm{C_4H_7^+}$ fragment peak. This concentrates the ion current into a single major fragmentation channel, making the peak at $m/z$ 55 particularly intense.\n\n**Analysis of 2-Hexene ($\\mathrm{CH_3-CH=CH-CH_2CH_2CH_3}$):**\nThis molecule is asymmetric. The high energy of $70\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ ionization allows the molecular ion to undergo rearrangement (isomerization) via hydrogen shifts before fragmentation. This means the 2-hexene radical cation can isomerize to other structures, such as 1-hexene or methylpentenes. Fragmentation then occurs from this mixture of isomeric radical cations.\n*   Direct allylic cleavage (of the C4-C5 bond) or fragmentation after minor rearrangement can lead to the loss of an ethyl radical, producing a peak at $m/z$ 55.\n*   Isomerization to a 1-hexene-like structure favors fragmentation to the stable allyl cation, $\\mathrm{C_3H_5^+}$, at $m/z$ 41.\n*   Isomerization to a methylpentene structure could favor loss of a methyl radical, producing a $\\mathrm{C_5H_9^+}$ ion at $m/z$ 69.\nConsequently, the fragment ion current for 2-hexene is distributed across multiple channels ($m/z$ 41, $m/z$ 55, $m/z$ 69, etc.), rather than being concentrated on a single fragment as in the symmetric 3-hexene.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A:** This option correctly captures the experimental outcome. It posits that 3-hexene's symmetry concentrates fragmentation into a single dominant channel ($m/z$ 55), while 2-hexene's fragmentation is distributed across multiple channels (notably producing $m/z$ 41 and $m/z$ 69 in addition to $m/z$ 55). Although the mechanistic description of \"nondegenerate scissions\" for 2-hexene is an oversimplification (as rearrangements are key), the described outcome is correct: the distribution of fragment intensities is different. The proposed quantitative ratios ($I(55)/I(41)$ and $I(69)/I(55)$) provide a logical and actionable method for distinguishing the isomers based on this difference.\n*   **B:** This option incorrectly applies the McLafferty rearrangement. For 2-hexene, a $\\gamma$-hydrogen is available, and rearrangement would lead to a peak at $m/z$ 56. For 3-hexene, it would lead to $m/z$ 42. The option has the logic reversed and incorrectly prioritizes this pathway.\n*   **C:** This option is incorrect. Formation of the propyl cation ($\\mathrm{C_3H_7^+}$, $m/z$ 43) is not a favored pathway for alkenes, which strongly prefer to form resonance-stabilized unsaturated cations like the allyl cation ($\\mathrm{C_3H_5^+}$, $m/z$ 41).\n*   **D:** This is fundamentally incorrect. Constitutional isomers have the exact same molecular formula ($\\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and therefore identical exact masses. High-resolution MS cannot distinguish them on this basis.\n*   **E:** This is incorrect. Formation of a saturated butyl cation ($\\mathrm{C_4H_9^+}$, $m/z$ 57) is characteristic of alkane fragmentation, not alkene fragmentation. The proposed mechanism is not a standard pathway.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A provides the most mechanistically plausible explanation for the observed differences in the mass spectra and proposes a sound, quantitative method for distinguishing the isomers. It correctly identifies that symmetry plays a key role in concentrating fragment intensity for 3-hexene, while the spectrum of 2-hexene is more complex due to competing fragmentation and rearrangement pathways.
