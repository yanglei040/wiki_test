By calculating the exact masses of several common fragments and determining the minimum resolving power needed to tell them apart, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how HRMS provides unambiguous identification of fragment ions [@problem_id:3704995].", "problem": "In electron ionization mass spectrometry of nitro-containing organic molecules, common fragment ions include the nitrosyl cation $NO^{+}$, the nitrogen dioxide cation $NO_{2}^{+}$, the $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$ cation arising from nitro-group rearrangement, and the carbon dioxide cation $CO_{2}^{+}$. Assume singly charged ions so that the observed mass-to-charge ratio satisfies $m/z = m$ in dalton (Da).

The relevant ions are $CO_{2}^{+}$ (mass $m_1 \\approx 43.99$) and $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$ (mass $m_2 \\approx 44.01$). The other ions, $NO^{+}$ ($m \\approx 30.00$) and $NO_{2}^{+}$ ($m \\approx 45.99$), are not as close to $m/z=44$ or to each other. The closest pair is indeed $CO_{2}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$.\n\nWe calculate the mass difference, $\\Delta m$, between these two ions using their unrounded masses for precision:\n$$m_1 = m(CO_{2}^{+}) = 43.98982923914$$\n$$m_2 = m(\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}) = 44.01363868846$$\n$$\\Delta m = |m_2 - m_1| = |44.01363868846 - 43.98982923914| = 0.02380944932$$\n\nNow, we calculate the minimum resolving power, $R$, required to resolve this pair. The problem specifies the use of the formula $R = m/\\Delta m$. When dealing with two distinct peaks, the most rigorous choice for the mass $m$ in this formula is the average mass of the two peaks, $m_{avg} = (m_1 + m_2)/2$.\n$$m_{avg} = \\frac{43.98982923914 + 44.01363868846}{2} = 44.0017339638$$\nUsing this average mass and the calculated mass difference $\\Delta m$, the required resolving power is:\n$$R = \\frac{m_{avg}}{\\Delta m} = \\frac{44.0017339638}{0.02380944932} \\approx 1848.083$$\nThe problem requires this final value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 1848$$\n\nFinally, we address the qualitative question: whether an instrument with a resolving power of $R_{instrument} = 30,000$ can distinguish these ions. The minimum required resolving power is calculated to be $R_{min} \\approx 1848$. Since the instrument's resolving power is substantially greater than the minimum requirement ($30,000 \\gg 1848$), the instrument can easily distinguish the $CO_{2}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_{2}NO}^{+}$ ions.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with no internal contradictions or missing information. The solution process can now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will focus on the expected primary fragmentation pathways for the molecular ions of nitrobenzene and phenyl nitrite, both having $m/z=123$.\n\n**1. Fragmentation of Nitrobenzene ($\\ce{C_6H_5NO_2}$)**\n\nThe molecular ion is $[\\ce{C_6H_5NO_2}]^{+\\bullet}$ with $m/z=123$.\n\n-   **Pathway I: Loss of $\\ce{NO_2.}$.** This involves the homolytic cleavage of the aryl $\\ce{C-N}$ bond.\n    $$[\\ce{C_6H_5NO_2}]^{+\\bullet} \\longrightarrow \\ce{C_6H_5^+} + \\ce{NO_2.}$$\n    This fragmentation produces the phenyl cation, $\\ce{C_6H_5^+}$, at $m/z = (6 \\times 12) + (5 \\times 1) = 77$. The neutral loss is the nitrogen dioxide radical, $\\ce{NO_2.}$, with a mass of $14 + (2 \\times 16) = 46 \\text{ u}$. This results in a diagnostic peak at $m/z=77$, which corresponds to $[M-46]^+$. The presence of a significant peak at $m/z=77$ is highly characteristic of nitroarenes.\n\n-   **Pathway II: Loss of $\\ce{NO.}$.** This is a more complex pathway that requires an intramolecular rearrangement known as the nitro-nitrite rearrangement, where the molecular ion isomerizes to a nitrite-like structure before fragmentation.\n    $$[\\ce{C_6H_5-NO_2}]^{+\\bullet} \\longrightarrow [\\ce{C_6H_5-O-NO}]^{+\\bullet} \\longrightarrow \\ce{C_6H_5O^+} + \\ce{NO.}$$\n    This fragmentation produces the phenoxy cation, $\\ce{C_6H_5O^+}$, at $m/z = (6 \\times 12) + (5 \\times 1) + 16 = 93$. This cation is stabilized by resonance. The neutral loss is the nitric oxide radical, $\\ce{NO.}$, with a mass of $14 + 16 = 30 \\text{ u}$. This results in a peak at $m/z=93$, which corresponds to $[M-30]^+$. For nitrobenzene, this peak is typically very intense, often the base peak.\n\n-   **Other Pathways:** Another fragmentation involves the formation of $\\ce{NO^+}$ at $m/z=30$.\n    $$[\\ce{C_6H_5-NO_2}]^{+\\bullet} \\longrightarrow \\ce{C_6H_5O.} + \\ce{NO^+}$$\n\n**2. Fragmentation of Phenyl Nitrite ($\\ce{C_6H_5ONO}$)**\n\nThe molecular ion is $[\\ce{C_6H_5ONO}]^{+\\bullet}$ with $m/z=123$.\n\n-   **Pathway III: Loss of $\\ce{NO.}$.** As per the provided principles, the $\\ce{O-N}$ bond is weak. Its simple homolytic cleavage is a highly favored process.\n    $$[\\ce{C_6H_5-O-NO}]^{+\\bullet} \\longrightarrow \\ce{C_6H_5O^+} + \\ce{NO.}$$\n    This is a direct cleavage that yields the same phenoxy cation, $\\ce{C_6H_5O^+}$, at $m/z=93$ and the nitric oxide radical, $\\ce{NO.}$. Since this fragmentation does not require a prior rearrangement and breaks the weakest bond, the peak at $m/z=93$ ($[M-30]^+$) is expected to be extremely intense for phenyl nitrite, likely representing the vast majority of the ion current.\n\n-   **Pathway IV: Loss of the nitrite group.** This would involve cleavage of the $\\ce{C-O}$ bond.\n    $$[\\ce{C_6H_5-O-NO}]^{+\\bullet} \\longrightarrow \\ce{C_6H_5^+} + \\ce{.ONO}$$\n    This produces the phenyl cation at $m/z=77$ ($[M-46]^+$). However, the aryl $\\ce{C-O}$ bond is significantly stronger than the $\\ce{O-N}$ bond. Therefore, this pathway is much less favorable than Pathway III, and the peak at $m/z=77$ is expected to be very weak or absent in the spectrum of phenyl nitrite.\n\n**3. Diagnostic Test Formulation**\n\nThe key difference between the two isomers lies in the relative abundances of the peaks at $m/z=77$ and $m/z=93$.\n-   **Nitrobenzene** will show significant peaks at both $m/z=77$ (from direct $\\ce{C-N}$ cleavage) and $m/z=93$ (from rearrangement then cleavage). The abundance of the $m/z=77$ peak is a strong indicator of the $\\ce{Ar-NO_2}$ structure.\n-   **Phenyl Nitrite** will show a dominant, very intense peak at $m/z=93$ (from direct cleavage of the weak $\\ce{O-N}$ bond) and a very weak or negligible peak at $m/z=77$.\n\nTherefore, a two-feature test comparing the peaks at $m/z=77$ and $m/z=93$ is appropriate. The presence of a substantial peak at $m/z=77$ identifies the nitro isomer. An overwhelmingly dominant peak at $m/z=93$ paired with a very weak peak at $m/z=77$ identifies the nitrite isomer.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Compare $[M-46]^+$ at $m/z=77$ and $[M-30]^+$ at $m/z=93$. Assign aryl nitro when $[M-46]^+$ is abundant (loss of $\\ce{NO_2.}$ to give $\\ce{C_6H_5+}$), and assign aryl nitrite when $[M-30]^+$ is abundant (loss of $\\ce{NO.}$ to give $\\ce{C_6H_5O+}$). Rationale: nitroarenes favor $\\ce{C-N}$ scission with charge retention on the ring to yield $\\ce{Ar+}$, whereas nitrites favor $\\ce{O-N}$ scission with charge retention on oxygen to yield $\\ce{ArO+}$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the two crucial diagnostic peaks at $m/z=77$ and $m/z=93$. The interpretation is correct: the presence of an abundant peak at $m/z=77$ is characteristic of the nitro compound. Similarly, the high abundance of the peak at $m/z=93$ is characteristic of the nitrite due to the facile cleavage of the weak $\\ce{O-N}$ bond. The rationale provided is mechanistically sound and consistent with the principles given in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Compare only $m/z=30$ and $m/z=46$. Assign aryl nitro when $m/z=30$ ($\\ce{NO+}$) exceeds $m/z=46$ ($\\ce{NO2+}$), and assign aryl nitrite when $m/z=46$ exceeds $m/z=30$. Rationale: the more “oxidized” functionality should preferentially give the higher-oxidation-state small cation.**\nThe formation of $\\ce{NO^+}$ ($m/z=30$) is plausible for both isomers. For the nitrite, it arises from charge retention on the $\\ce{NO}$ fragment during the facile $\\ce{O-N}$ bond cleavage. For the nitro compound, it arises after rearrangement. The formation of $\\ce{NO_2^+}$ ($m/z=46$) is less favorable than the loss of the neutral radical $\\ce{NO_2.}$. Furthermore, the prediction that the nitrite would preferentially form $\\ce{NO_2^+}$ is mechanistically unsound; the nitrite does not contain a pre-formed $\\ce{NO_2}$ unit. In reality, the aryl nitrite is expected to show a much stronger $\\ce{NO^+}$ peak than the nitroarene. The option's prediction is the opposite of what is expected. The rationale is vague and not based on fragmentation rules.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Compare $[M-18]^+$ and $[M-28]^+$. Assign aryl nitrite when $[M-18]^+$ is strong (loss of $\\ce{H2O}$ from the molecular ion), and assign aryl nitro when $[M-28]^+$ is strong (loss of $\\ce{CO}$). Rationale: nitrites are alcohol-like and dehydrate; nitroarenes can expel $\\ce{CO}$ under EI.**\nLoss of water ($18 \\text{ u}$) from phenyl nitrite is not a simple or expected fragmentation pathway. The analogy that \"nitrites are alcohol-like\" is inappropriate. Loss of carbon monoxide ($\\ce{CO}$, $28 \\text{ u}$) is a known fragmentation in nitrobenzene, but it is a secondary fragmentation that occurs from the phenoxy cation at $m/z=93$, not from the molecular ion at $m/z=123$. The peak would be at $m/z=65$ ($93-28$), not $[M-28]^+$ ($m/z=95$). The proposed diagnostic features are not primary or major fragmentation products as described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Compare $[M-30]^+$ and $m/z=46$. Assign aryl nitrite when $[M-30]^+$ is weak and $m/z=46$ is strong, and assign aryl nitro when $[M-30]^+$ is strong and $m/z=46$ is weak. Rationale: the $\\ce{O-N}$ bond is strong, so nitrites resist loss of $\\ce{NO.}$ and instead produce $\\ce{NO2+}$.**\nThe rationale in this option (\"the $\\ce{O-N}$ bond is strong\") directly contradicts a fundamental principle stated in the problem (\"The $\\ce{O-N}$ bond in nitrite esters is typically weaker...\"). Based on this alone, the option is invalid. Furthermore, its predictions are wrong: aryl nitrite should show a very strong $[M-30]^+$ peak ($m/z=93$) due to the weak $\\ce{O-N}$ bond, not a weak one. It also incorrectly predicts a strong $\\ce{NO_2^+}$ ($m/z=46$) peak for the nitrite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3705033"}, {"introduction": "Isotopic labeling is a definitive technique used to trace the movement of atoms and unravel complex reaction mechanisms, including fragmentation pathways in mass spectrometry.

The relationship between these masses is given by:\n$$M_{labeled} = M_{unlabeled} - m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) + m(^{15}\\mathrm{N})$$\nLet's define the mass difference due to isotopic substitution as $\\delta_N$:\n$$\\delta_N = m(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) - m(^{14}\\mathrm{N})$$\nSo, $M_{labeled} = M_{unlabeled} + \\delta_N$.\n\nWe will analyze the mass shift for each fragment ion separately. The problem assumes singly charged ions, so the shift in $m/z$ is equal to the shift in mass.\n\n**1. Analysis of the $[M-46]^{+}$ Fragment**\n\nThe hypothesis states that this fragment is formed by the loss of a neutral $\\mathrm{NO}_2$ molecule, which carries the nitro nitrogen.\n\n- **Unlabeled case**: The precursor has a mass of $M_{unlabeled}$ and loses a neutral $^{14}\\mathrm{NO}_2$. The mass of the resulting fragment, $m([M-46]^{+}_{unlabeled})$, is:\n$$m([M-46]^{+}_{unlabeled}) = M_{unlabeled} - m(^{14}\\mathrm{NO}_2) = M_{unlabeled} - (m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) + 2 \\cdot m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}))$$\n\n- **Labeled case**: The precursor has a mass of $M_{labeled}$ and loses a neutral $^{15}\\mathrm{NO}_2$. The mass of the resulting fragment, $m([M-46]^{+}_{labeled})$, is:\n$$m([M-46]^{+}_{labeled}) = M_{labeled} - m(^{15}\\mathrm{NO}_2) = M_{labeled} - (m(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) + 2 \\cdot m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}))$$\n\nThe mass shift for the $[M-46]^{+}$ fragment, denoted as $\\text{shift}_{M-46}$, is the difference between the labeled and unlabeled fragment masses:\n$$\\text{shift}_{M-46} = m([M-46]^{+}_{labeled}) - m([M-46]^{+}_{unlabeled})$$\n$$\\text{shift}_{M-46} = [M_{labeled} - (m(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) + 2 \\cdot m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}))] - [M_{unlabeled} - (m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) + 2 \\cdot m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}))]$$\n$$\\text{shift}_{M-46} = (M_{labeled} - M_{unlabeled}) - (m(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) - m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}))$$\nSubstituting $M_{labeled} - M_{unlabeled} = \\delta_N$ and $m(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) - m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) = \\delta_N$:\n$$\\text{shift}_{M-46} = \\delta_N - \\delta_N = 0$$\nThus, the $m/z$ of the $[M-46]^{+}$ fragment does not shift upon labeling, as the isotopic label is lost in the neutral fragment.\n\n**2. Analysis of the $[M-30]^{+}$ Fragment**\n\nThe hypothesis states that this fragment is formed by a rearrangement in which the fragment ion *retains* the nitro nitrogen, and a neutral species of mass $30$ Da that does *not* contain nitrogen is lost. Let's denote the mass of this neutral species as $m_{neutral_30}$.\n\n- **Unlabeled case**: The precursor has a mass of $M_{unlabeled}$ and loses the neutral species. The resulting fragment retains the $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ atom. The mass of the fragment, $m([M-30]^{+}_{unlabeled})$, is:\n$$m([M-30]^{+}_{unlabeled}) = M_{unlabeled} - m_{neutral_{30}}$$\n\n- **Labeled case**: The precursor has a mass of $M_{labeled}$ and loses the same neutral species (which does not contain the label). The resulting fragment retains the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ atom. The mass of the fragment, $m([M-30]^{+}_{labeled})$, is:\n$$m([M-30]^{+}_{labeled}) = M_{labeled} - m_{neutral_{30}}$$\n\nThe mass shift for the $[M-30]^{+}$ fragment, denoted as $\\text{shift}_{M-30}$, is the difference between the labeled and unlabeled fragment masses:\n$$\\text{shift}_{M-30} = m([M-30]^{+}_{labeled}) - m([M-30]^{+}_{unlabeled})$$\n$$\\text{shift}_{M-30} = (M_{labeled} - m_{neutral_{30}}) - (M_{unlabeled} - m_{neutral_{30}})$$\n$$\\text{shift}_{M-30} = M_{labeled} - M_{unlabeled}$$\nSubstituting $M_{labeled} - M_{unlabeled} = \\delta_N$:\n$$\\text{shift}_{M-30} = \\delta_N$$\nThus, the $m/z$ of the $[M-30]^{+}$ fragment shifts by the mass difference between the nitrogen isotopes, as the label is retained in the charged fragment.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Final Difference $\\Delta$**\n\nThe problem asks for the quantity $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = (\\text{m/z shift of }[M-30]^{+}) - (\\text{m/z shift of }[M-46]^{+})$$\n$$\\Delta = \\text{shift}_{M-30} - \\text{shift}_{M-46}$$\nSubstituting the results from our analysis:\n$$\\Delta = \\delta_N - 0 = \\delta_N$$\nSo, the final value is simply the mass difference between the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ and $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ isotopes.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values for the masses:\n$$\\Delta = m(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) - m(^{14}\\mathrm{N})$$\n$$\\Delta = 15.000109\\,\\mathrm{Da} - 14.003074\\,\\mathrm{Da}$$\n$$\\Delta = 0.997035\\,\\mathrm{Da}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to six significant figures. The calculated value $0.997035$ already has six significant figures ($9$, $9$, $7$, $0$, $3$, $5$), so no further rounding is necessary.\nThe entire analysis demonstrates that the experiment as designed is a direct probe of which atoms are retained in a fragment ion. The final result depends only on the isotopic masses and the stated hypotheses, not on the mass of the parent compound or other atoms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.997035}$$", "id": "3705054"}]}
