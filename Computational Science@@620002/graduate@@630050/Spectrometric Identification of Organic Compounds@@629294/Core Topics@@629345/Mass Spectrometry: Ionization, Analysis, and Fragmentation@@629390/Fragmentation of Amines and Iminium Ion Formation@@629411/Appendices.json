Consider the family of such iminium ions in which the alkyl substituent $\\mathrm{R}$ is a saturated, linear chain comprising $n-1$ carbon atoms, so that the total carbon count in the iminium cation is $n$. Using the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- The mass-to-charge ratio is defined as $m/z$, and for singly charged ions $z=1$, thus $m/z$ equals the ionic mass.\n- Nominal atomic masses (integer mass numbers) are $m_{\\mathrm{C}}=12$, $m_{\\mathrm{H}}=1$, and $m_{\\mathrm{N}}=14$.\n- A saturated, linear alkyl substituent with $m$ carbon atoms has the general formula $\\mathrm{C}_m\\mathrm{H}_{2m+1}$ when bound as a single substituent.\n- An iminium cation is a protonated imine with a $\\mathrm{C{=}N}$ double bond, and the fragment $\\mathrm{CH{=}NH_2}$ contributes one carbon and three hydrogens in total (one on carbon, two on nitrogen) along with one nitrogen.\n\nDerive, from first principles of valence and composition, the general molecular formula of the iminium cation as a function of $n$, then express its nominal $m/z$ value as a function of $n$.

It provides all necessary information to derive a unique and verifiable solution based on fundamental principles of organic chemistry and mass spectrometry. The problem is declared valid, and the solution proceeds.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, of a series of alkyl iminium cations and evaluate it for specific cases. The general structure of the cation is given as $\\left[\\mathrm{RCH{=}NH_2}\\right]^+$, where $\\mathrm{R}$ is a saturated, linear alkyl substituent.\n\nFirst, we determine the general molecular formula of the cation as a function of $n$, the total number of carbon atoms in the ion. The structure can be deconstructed into two parts: the alkyl group $\\mathrm{R}$ and the fragment $\\mathrm{CH{=}NH_2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the total carbon count in the ion is $n$. The $\\mathrm{CH{=}NH_2}$ fragment contains exactly one carbon atom. Therefore, the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl substituent $\\mathrm{R}$, which we can denote as $m_{\\mathrm{C,R}}$, must be:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{C,R}} = n - 1$$\nThis is consistent with the problem's definition that $\\mathrm{R}$ comprises $n-1$ carbon atoms.\n\nThe problem also provides the general formula for a saturated, linear alkyl substituent with $m$ carbon atoms as $\\mathrm{C}_m\\mathrm{H}_{2m+1}$. We apply this to our group $\\mathrm{R}$ by substituting $m = n-1$:\n$$ \\text{Formula for R} = \\mathrm{C}_{n-1}\\mathrm{H}_{2(n-1)+1} = \\mathrm{C}_{n-1}\\mathrm{H}_{2n-2+1} = \\mathrm{C}_{n-1}\\mathrm{H}_{2n-1} $$\nThe remaining part of the ion is the fragment $\\mathrm{CH{=}NH_2}$. This fragment contains $1$ carbon atom, $3$ hydrogen atoms ($1$ on the carbon and $2$ on the nitrogen), and $1$ nitrogen atom. Its composition is $\\mathrm{CH_3N}$.\n\nThe total molecular formula of the iminium cation is obtained by summing the atomic compositions of the $\\mathrm{R}$ group and the $\\mathrm{CH{=}NH_2}$ fragment:\n- Total Carbon atoms: $(n-1) + 1 = n$\n- Total Hydrogen atoms: $(2n-1) + 3 = 2n+2$\n- Total Nitrogen atoms: $0 + 1 = 1$\n\nThus, the general molecular formula for the iminium cation as a function of $n$ is $\\mathrm{C}_n\\mathrm{H}_{2n+2}\\mathrm{N}$. The positive charge does not significantly affect the nominal mass calculation.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the nominal mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$. The problem specifies that these are singly charged ions, so the charge $z$ is $1$. This means the $m/z$ value is numerically equal to the nominal mass of the ion, $m$. We calculate this mass using the provided nominal integer atomic masses: $m_{\\mathrm{C}}=12$, $m_{\\mathrm{H}}=1$, and $m_{\\mathrm{N}}=14$.\n\nThe nominal mass, $M(n)$, as a function of the total carbon count $n$, is given by:\n$$ M(n) = n \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{C}} + (2n+2) \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H}} + 1 \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{N}} $$\nSubstituting the given atomic masses:\n$$ M(n) = n \\cdot 12 + (2n+2) \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 14 $$\n$$ M(n) = 12n + 2n + 2 + 14 $$\n$$ M(n) = 14n + 16 $$\nSince $z=1$, the general expression for the mass-to-charge ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{m}{z}(n) = 14n + 16 $$\nWe are asked to evaluate this expression for $n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nFor $n=1$: The ion is $\\left[\\mathrm{HCH{=}NH_2}\\right]^+$, which is $\\left[\\mathrm{CH_2{=}NH_2}\\right]^+$.\n$$ \\frac{m}{z}(1) = 14(1) + 16 = 14 + 16 = 30 $$\n\nFor $n=2$: The ion is $\\left[\\mathrm{CH_3CH{=}NH_2}\\right]^+$.\n$$ \\frac{m}{z}(2) = 14(2) + 16 = 28 + 16 = 44 $$\n\nFor $n=3$: The ion is $\\left[\\mathrm{C_2H_5CH{=}NH_2}\\right]^+$.\n$$ \\frac{m}{z}(3) = 14(3) + 16 = 42 + 16 = 58 $$\n\nFor $n=4$: The ion is $\\left[\\mathrm{C_3H_7CH{=}NH_2}\\right]^+$.\n$$ \\frac{m}{z}(4) = 14(4) + 16 = 56 + 16 = 72 $$\n\nFor $n=5$: The ion is $\\left[\\mathrm{C_4H_9CH{=}NH_2}\\right]^+$.\n$$ \\frac{m}{z}(5) = 14(5) + 16 = 70 + 16 = 86 $$\n\nThe resulting sequence of nominal $m/z$ values is $30, 44, 58, 72, 86$. This calculated sequence is identical to the commonly observed nominal series given in the problem statement, which confirms the validity of the derived formula and the chemical fragmentation model upon which it is based.

According to the problem's principles, it will fragment to give an even-electron (EE) cation and a neutral radical. We analyze the two specified $\\alpha$-cleavage pathways.\n\nThe $\\alpha$-carbon (C$_\\alpha$) is the one attached to the nitrogen atom, and the $\\beta$-carbon (C$_\\beta$) is adjacent to it: $\\mathrm{CH}_3-\\mathrm{C}_\\beta\\mathrm{H}_2-\\mathrm{C}_\\alpha\\mathrm{H}_2-\\mathrm{NH}_2$.\n\n**Pathway 1: C$_\\alpha$–C$_\\beta$ Bond Scission**\nThis pathway involves the homolytic cleavage of the bond between the $\\alpha$-carbon and the $\\beta$-carbon. The driving force is the formation of a resonance-stabilized iminium cation.\n$$ \\mathrm{[CH_3CH_2\\text{---}CH_2NH_2]}^{+\\cdot} \\longrightarrow [\\mathrm{CH_2=NH_2}]^+ + \\cdot\\mathrm{CH_2CH_3} $$\nLet's analyze the products:\n1.  **Cation:** The fragment $[\\mathrm{CH_2{=}NH_2}]^{+}$ is the methyleniminium cation. This is an even-electron (EE) species, stabilized by resonance $(\\mathrm{[CH_2-\\overset{+}{\\ddot{N}}H_2]} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{[CH_2=\\overset{+}{N}H_2]})$.\n    Its $m/z$ is: $(1 \\times 12) + (4 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 14) = 12 + 4 + 14 = 30$.\n2.  **Neutral Fragment:** The fragment $\\cdot\\mathrm{CH_2CH_3}$ is the ethyl radical.

The former pathway is accompanied by a neutral radical fragment (ethyl), whereas the latter yields the iminium that retains the propyl skeleton at the iminium carbon.**\n-   This statement accurately describes the C$_\\alpha$–C$_\\beta$ cleavage pathway, correctly identifying the products as the ethyl radical and the even-electron methyleniminium cation, $\\mathrm{[CH_2{=}NH_2]^+}$, at $m/z$ $30$.\n-   It also accurately describes the $\\alpha$-hydrogen loss pathway, correctly identifying the product as the even-electron iminium ion $\\mathrm{[CH_3CH_2CH{=}NH_2]^+}$, at $m/z$ $58$.\n-   Finally, it correctly associates the first pathway with the production of the ethyl radical and the second pathway with the retention of the propyl skeleton in the resulting iminium ion. This correctly addresses both clauses of the question.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The dominant $\\alpha$-process is heterolytic C$_\\alpha$–N bond cleavage of $M^{+\\cdot}$ to give a propyl cation $\\mathrm{C_3H_7^+}$ at $m/z\\,43$ and a neutral $\\mathrm{NH_2\\cdot}$, while the alternative is homolytic C$_\\alpha$–H cleavage giving an ethyl-substituted iminium $\\mathrm{[CH_3CH{=}NH_2]^+}$ at $m/z\\,44$; formation of $\\mathrm{[CH_3CH_2CH{=}NH_2]^+}$ does not occur directly from $M^{+\\cdot}$.**\n-   Cleavage of the C$_\\alpha$–N bond is not an $\\alpha$-cleavage as defined by the problem (C$_\\alpha$–C$_\\beta$ or C$_\\alpha$–H cleavage).

The option incorrectly states the product is $\\mathrm{[CH_3CH_2CH{=}NH_2]^+}$.\n-   The statement that $\\alpha$-cleavage produces $\\mathrm{[CH_2{=}NH_2]^+}$ plus a *vinyl* radical ($\\cdot\\mathrm{CH{=}CH_2}$) is false. It produces an *ethyl* radical ($\\cdot\\mathrm{CH_2CH_3}$).\n-   The statement that \"under EI, only even-electron ions are formed\" is fundamentally false. The initial molecular ion, $M^{+\\cdot}$, is an odd-electron ion.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Odd-electron $M^{+\\cdot}$ can only split into odd-electron fragment ions; therefore, iminium ions are not observed under EI.

For the hypothesized iminium cation, $C_{5}H_{12}N^{+}$, the theoretical mass, denoted as $m_{\\text{theor}}$, is calculated using the provided monoisotopic atomic masses for carbon ($^{12}\\!C$), hydrogen ($^{1}\\!H$), and nitrogen ($^{14}\\!N$).\n\nThe formula for the theoretical mass is:\n$$m_{\\text{theor}}(C_{5}H_{12}N^{+}) = 5 \\times m(^{12}\\!C) + 12 \\times m(^{1}\\!H) + 1 \\times m(^{14}\\!N)$$\nSubstituting the given values, $m(^{12}\\!C) = 12.000000$, $m(^{1}\\!H) = 1.007825$, and $m(^{14}\\!N) = 14.003074$:\n$$m_{\\text{theor}} = (5 \\times 12.000000) + (12 \\times 1.007825) + (1 \\times 14.003074)$$\nPerforming the arithmetic:\n$$m_{\\text{theor}} = 60.000000 + 12.093900 + 14.003074$$\n$$m_{\\text{theor}} = 86.096974$$\nThus, the theoretical monoisotopic exact mass for the ion $C_{5}H_{12}N^{+}$ is $86.096974$.\n\n2.  **Derivation and Calculation of Mass Error**\n\nThe relative mass error, $\\delta_{r}$, is defined as the difference between the experimentally measured mass ($m_{\\text{meas}}$) and the theoretical mass ($m_{\\text{theor}}$), divided by the theoretical mass:\n$$\\delta_{r} = \\frac{m_{\\text{meas}} - m_{\\text{theor}}}{m_{\\text{theor}}}$$\nThe mass error expressed in parts per million (ppm), $\\Delta m_{\\text{ppm}}$, is the relative mass error multiplied by a factor of $10^6$:\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{ppm}} = \\delta_{r} \\times 10^6 = \\left( \\frac{m_{\\text{meas}} - m_{\\text{theor}}}{m_{\\text{theor}}} \\right) \\times 10^6$$\nThe absolute mass error is the numerator term, $\\Delta m = m_{\\text{meas}} - m_{\\text{theor}}$.\nFrom the problem statement, the measured mass is $m_{\\text{meas}} = 86.09698$. Using our calculated theoretical mass, $m_{\\text{theor}} = 86.096974$, we can now compute the mass error in ppm:\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{ppm}} = \\left( \\frac{86.09698 - 86.096974}{86.096974} \\right) \\times 10^6$$\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{ppm}} = \\left( \\frac{0.000006}{86.096974} \\right) \\times 10^6$$\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{ppm}} \\approx 0.0696895 \\, \\text{ppm}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as required, yields $0.06969$ ppm.\n\n3.  **Qualitative Reasoning for Ion Origin**\n\nThe assignment of the ion at $m/z = 86$ to an iminium cation formed via $\\alpha$-cleavage is strongly supported by fundamental principles of mass spectrometry, which stand in contrast to the chemically inconsistent hypothesis of a quaternary ammonium fragment origin.\n\nFirst, the **nitrogen rule** is a key diagnostic tool. It states that a species containing an odd number of nitrogen atoms will have an odd nominal mass if it is an odd-electron species (e.g., a radical cation, $M^{+\\bullet}$) and an even nominal mass if it is an even-electron species. The sample is a neutral amine, which contains one nitrogen atom. Electron ionization (EI) generates a molecular ion, $M^{+\\bullet}$, by ejecting one electron. This $M^{+\\bullet}$ is an odd-electron species and, according to the rule, must have an odd nominal mass. The observed ion at $m/z = 86$ has an even nominal mass. Since it contains one nitrogen atom (an odd number), it must be an even-electron ion. This is entirely consistent with the structure of an iminium cation, $C_{5}H_{12}N^{+}$, which is a stable, even-electron fragment ion.\n\nSecond, the formation of this ion is explained by the **dominant fragmentation pathway for amines in EI, which is $\\alpha$-cleavage**. This process involves the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond alpha to the nitrogen atom in the molecular ion. This pathway is highly favorable because it produces a stable, even-electron iminium cation and a neutral radical. The pronounced stability of the iminium cation, $[R_2C=NR_2]^{+}$, arises because all heavy atoms (carbon and nitrogen) satisfy the octet rule, a powerful stabilizing feature. The prevalence of this pathway explains why the resulting fragment ion is often the most abundant ion in the spectrum, i.e., the base peak. For instance, a precursor like N,N-diethylpropylamine ($C_7H_{17}N$) could fragment via loss of a propyl radical to yield the ion $[(CH_3CH_2)_2N=CH_2]^{+}$ which has the composition $C_{5}H_{12}N^{+}$ and a mass-to-charge ratio of $86$.\n\nThird, the alternative hypothesis of a **fragment from a preformed quaternary ammonium cation is scientifically invalid** under the given experimental conditions. Quaternary ammonium compounds are salts (e.g., $[R_4N]^{+}X^{-}$). They are non-volatile and thermally unstable, making them incompatible with analysis by electron ionization, a technique that requires the sample to be a neutral, volatile compound that can be introduced into the gas phase. The problem explicitly states that the sample is a \"volatile aliphatic amine\" analyzed by \"electron ionization.\" Therefore, the observed ion must originate from the fragmentation of the neutral amine precursor in the gas phase inside the ion source. The preformed quaternary cation hypothesis is inconsistent with the chemical nature of the sample and the principles of the analytical method used.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.06969}$$", "id": "3704352"}]}
