A widely repeated heuristic is that a strong peak at $m/z=91$ indicates an alkylbenzene.

It is scientifically grounded in the well-understood chemistry of ion formation and fragmentation in Electron Ionization (EI) mass spectrometry, particularly concerning aromatic hydrocarbons. The provided information is self-consistent and sufficient to evaluate the accompanying statements. The core of the problem—the potential ambiguity of the $m/z=91$ peak and the need for a rigorous, multi-faceted analysis—is a classic topic in organic spectroscopy. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\nThe problem describes an unknown hydrocarbon with a molecular ion ($M^+$) peak at $m/z=106$ and a base peak at $m/z=91$.\nFirst, let us determine the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon. For a hydrocarbon $\\mathrm{C_xH_y}$, the mass is given by the sum of the masses of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Using integer masses, $12x + y = 106$. The only chemically plausible solution for $x$ and $y$ that fits this equation (and satisfies valence rules, specifically the degree of unsaturation) is $x=8$, $y=10$, yielding the formula $\\mathrm{C_8H_{10}}$. The mass contribution from carbon is $8 \\times 12 = 96$, so the mass from hydrogen is $106 - 96 = 10$. The degree of unsaturation is $(2 \\times 8 + 2 - 10)/2 = 4$, consistent with an alkyl-substituted benzene ring. Possible isomers include ethylbenzene, o-, m-, and p-xylene, and non-aromatic structures like methylcycloheptatriene.\n\nThe base peak at $m/z=91$ corresponds to a fragment ion, which high-resolution mass spectrometry would confirm as $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$. The formation of this ion from a $\\mathrm{C_8H_{10}}$ precursor involves the loss of a neutral fragment with mass $106 - 91 = 15$. This corresponds to a methyl radical, $\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$.\n\nThe central chemical principle is the exceptional stability of the tropylium cation, a $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ isomer with a seven-membered ring and $6$ delocalized $\\pi$ electrons, making it aromatic according to Hückel's rule ($4n+2$ with $n=1$). Less stable $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ isomers, such as the benzyl cation ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2^+}$), readily rearrange to the more stable tropylium structure in the gas phase. Consequently, any precursor molecule that can form a $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ fragment, regardless of its initial structure, will likely yield the common tropylium ion, making this peak a frequent but non-specific indicator.\n\nA first-principles analysis must therefore go beyond the simple observation of the $m/z=91$ peak and use all available spectral information to deduce the original connectivity of the molecule, in accordance with the foundational facts provided.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Because $m/z=91$ corresponds to $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$, the precursor must contain a benzylic position on a benzene ring; non-benzenoid precursors such as cycloheptatriene cannot form $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ under EI conditions.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The assertion that the precursor must contain a benzylic position is a logical fallacy; it incorrectly assumes a single fragmentation pathway. More egregiously, the claim that non-benzenoid precursors like cycloheptatriene ($\\mathrm{C_7H_8}$) cannot form $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ is factually false. Cycloheptatriene is a classic precursor for the tropylium cation via the loss of a single hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H^\\bullet}$). Similarly, a methylcycloheptatriene ($\\mathrm{C_8H_{10}}$) could readily lose a methyl radical ($\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$) to form the tropylium cation. This statement exemplifies the oversimplified heuristic that the problem asks to avoid.\n\n**B. Interconversion between benzylium and tropylium $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ topologies is expected; therefore, the mere presence of an intense $m/z=91$ peak does not specify the side-chain identity. A defensible assignment requires additional evidence such as exact mass of $M^+$, complementary ring-retaining ions (e.g., $m/z=105$, $m/z=77$), and, when available, metastable transitions linking $M^+$ to $m/z=91$.**\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. It accurately reflects the principles of modern mass spectrometry.\n1.  It correctly states that benzylium and tropylium cations interconvert, driven by the thermodynamic stability of the aromatic tropylium ion.\n2.  It draws the correct conclusion: because multiple precursors can lead to the same stable fragment ion, the fragment itself is not uniquely diagnostic of the precursor's structure.\n3.  It correctly lists essential corroborating evidence needed for a valid structural assignment:\n    -   Exact mass of $M^+$ confirms the elemental composition ($\\mathrm{C_8H_{10}}$).\n    -   Complementary ions provide structural clues. For instance, ethylbenzene shows a strong loss of $\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$ ($m/z=106 \\rightarrow 91$), while xylenes typically show a strong loss of $\\mathrm{H^\\bullet}$ to give $m/z=105$ ($\\mathrm{C_8H_9^+}$). The presence of a phenyl cation ($m/z=77$, $\\mathrm{C_6H_5^+}$) also provides information.\n    -   Metastable ion analysis can confirm fragmentation pathways. A metastable peak for the transition $106^+ \\rightarrow 91^+$ would be strong evidence for a direct loss of $15$ amu, favoring the ethylbenzene structure.\nThis statement fully aligns with a rigorous, first-principles approach.\n\n**C. An exact mass measurement of the $m/z=91$ ion alone is sufficient to conclude the presence of an ethyl substituent on benzene when $M^+$ is at $m/z=106$.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. An exact mass measurement confirms the elemental formula of an ion but does not reveal its structure or the structure of its precursor. Knowing the fragment is $\\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}$ and the precursor is $\\mathrm{C_8H_{10}}$ only confirms the neutral loss is $\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$. It does not distinguish between isomers that can undergo this loss. For example, ethylbenzene ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2CH_3}$) loses $\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$ to form the benzyl cation. However, methylcycloheptatriene ($\\mathrm{C_7H_7CH_3}$), also a $\\mathrm{C_8H_{10}}$ isomer, would also lose $\\mathrm{CH_3^\\bullet}$ to form the tropylium cation. Thus, exact mass alone is not sufficient to determine connectivity, as stated in the problem's foundational fact (iii).\n\n**D. A chlorine-containing aryl derivative can also exhibit a strong $m/z=91$ peak via loss of a chlorine atom followed by rearrangement; verification of the characteristic $M/M+2$ isotopic pattern (approximately $\\sim 3:1$ for chlorine) and analysis of neutral losses should precede any assignment of an alkylbenzene substructure.**\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. Although the problem specifies the unknown is a hydrocarbon, the question asks for statements consistent with a first-principles analysis that *avoids misidentification*. A crucial part of such an analysis is to not assume the elemental composition from a single fragment. Benzyl chloride ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2Cl}$) is a classic example of a compound that readily loses a chlorine atom ($\\mathrm{Cl^\\bullet}$) to form the benzyl cation ($m/z=91$). A naive interpretation of the $m/z=91$ peak could lead to a misidentification. A rigorous analyst would first inspect the molecular ion region for the characteristic $M$ and $M+2$ isotope peaks for chlorine (approximate ratio $3:1$). The absence of this pattern is necessary evidence to support the conclusion that the compound is a hydrocarbon. This statement describes a critical step in a valid analytical protocol designed to prevent common errors.\n\n**E. Energy-resolved EI that shows an abundant $m/z=91$ at low appearance energy uniquely indicates a cycloheptatrienyl precursor rather than an alkylbenzene, so no further corroboration is necessary.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. It makes two claims that are too strong. First, while it is true that a precursor whose structure is closer to the final fragment ion (e.g., cycloheptatriene forming tropylium) will often have a lower appearance energy (AE) for that fragment, the word \"uniquely\" is problematic. Other high-energy isomers could potentially exhibit a low AE, and experimental measurements have uncertainties. Second, the assertion that \"no further corroboration is necessary\" is fundamentally unscientific. Structural elucidation in chemistry relies on the careful accumulation and cross-validation of multiple forms of evidence. A single measurement, even a sophisticated one like AE, should not be considered infallible or sufficient to close an investigation. This stance is antithetical to a rigorous, first-principles approach.\n\nIn summary, statements B and D are consistent with a meticulous and critical approach to spectral interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "3704513"}]}
