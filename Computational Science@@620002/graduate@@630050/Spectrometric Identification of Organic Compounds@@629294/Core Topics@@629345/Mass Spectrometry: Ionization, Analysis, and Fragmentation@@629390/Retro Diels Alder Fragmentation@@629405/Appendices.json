This implies that its transition state structure and its response to changes in reaction enthalpy are typical of the reference series.\n$2$. The Evans–Polanyi relationship correlates enthalpies. However, reaction rates are fundamentally determined by the Gibbs free energy of activation, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger} - T\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$. The validity of the enthalpy-based correlation thus presupposes that the activation entropy, $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$, is either constant for all reactions in the series or varies in a predictable, linear fashion with $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$ (enthalpy-entropy compensation).\n$3$. The application of a model for a neutral thermal reaction to a fragmentation process in electron ionization mass spectrometry is a significant approximation. It assumes that the RDA fragmentation proceeds from a thermalized, ground-state radical cation of cyclohexene. It further assumes that the potential energy surface for the radical cation's fragmentation is sufficiently analogous to that of the neutral species, such that the activation enthalpy of the neutral reaction provides a reasonable estimate for the critical energy of the ion fragmentation.

It is free from the flaws listed in the validation checklist.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will be derived based on the provided givens.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe relative rate of the retro Diels-Alder (RDA) reaction for the *endo* and *exo* adducts is given by the ratio of their respective rate constants, $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{exo}}$. Using the provided Transition State Theory (TST) equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{endo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{exo}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}}}{RT}\\right)}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{endo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{exo}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem provides a model for the activation energies: $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{TS}} - E_{\\mathrm{product}}$. For the two stereoisomers, we have:\n-   For the *endo* adduct: $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}} - E_{\\mathrm{endo}}$\n-   For the *exo* adduct: $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{TS, exo}} - E_{\\mathrm{exo}}$\n\nThe difference in activation energies is therefore:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}} \\approx (E_{\\mathrm{TS, exo}} - E_{\\mathrm{exo}}) - (E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}} - E_{\\mathrm{endo}})\n$$\n\nRearranging the terms gives:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}} \\approx (E_{\\mathrm{endo}} - E_{\\mathrm{exo}}) + (E_{\\mathrm{TS, exo}} - E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}})\n$$\n\nNow we analyze the two terms on the right-hand side based on the problem's givens:\n1.  **$(E_{\\mathrm{endo}} - E_{\\mathrm{exo}})$**: This term represents the difference in thermodynamic stability of the two adducts. The problem states that due to steric strain, the *endo* adduct is less stable: $E_{\\mathrm{endo}} > E_{\\mathrm{exo}}$. Therefore, $(E_{\\mathrm{endo}} - E_{\\mathrm{exo}})$ is a positive quantity. This means the *endo* isomer starts from a higher energy ground state, which reduces its activation barrier for the RDA reaction.\n2.  **$(E_{\\mathrm{TS, exo}} - E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}})$**: This term represents the difference in the energies of the transition states for the two pathways. The problem states that due to secondary orbital interactions, the *endo* cycloaddition transition state is stabilized relative to the *exo* one: $E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}} < E_{\\mathrm{TS, exo}}$. By the principle of microscopic reversibility, these are the same transition states for the RDA reaction. Therefore, $(E_{\\mathrm{TS, exo}} - E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}})$ is also a positive quantity. This means the *endo* isomer reaction proceeds through a lower-energy transition state, which also reduces its activation barrier.\n\nSince both terms are positive, their sum must be positive:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}} > 0 \\implies \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}} < \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}}\n$$\n\nA lower activation energy corresponds to a faster reaction rate. Consequently, $k_{\\mathrm{endo}} > k_{\\mathrm{exo}}$, and the rate ratio $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}}$ must be greater than $1$.\n\nThe problem provides the numerical value for this difference: $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}} - \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}} = 8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. We can now calculate the rate ratio at $T = 600\\ \\mathrm{K}$. The gas constant is $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}K^{-1}}$.\n\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{endo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{exo}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{8000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}K^{-1}}) \\times (600\\ \\mathrm{K})}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{8000}{4988.4}\\right) \\approx \\exp(1.6037) \\approx 4.97\n$$\n\nThe calculated rate ratio is approximately $5$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}} > 1$; specifically, with $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = 8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ at $T = 600\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}} \\approx 7$, because the endo adduct has a lower $E_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ from secondary orbital stabilization and a higher product energy from steric strain, both lowering $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}}$.**\n\n-   **Rate Ratio**: The statement $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}} > 1$ is qualitatively correct, as derived above.\n-   **Mechanistic Rationale**: The reasoning is entirely correct. The *endo* adduct has a higher ground state energy ($E_{\\mathrm{endo}}$) due to steric strain and proceeds through a lower energy transition state ($E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}}$) due to the persistence of secondary orbital interactions. Both factors contribute to lowering the activation energy for the *endo* RDA reaction, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, endo}} = E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}} - E_{\\mathrm{endo}}$, relative to the *exo* pathway.\n-   **Numerical Value**: The option claims $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}} \\approx 7$. Our calculation based on the problem's data yields $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}} \\approx 5$. There is a numerical inconsistency between the given energy difference ($8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) and the resulting rate ratio in this option. However, the qualitative prediction and the mechanistic rationale are perfectly sound. Among the given choices, this option provides the best description of the chemical phenomena. The numerical discrepancy is likely a minor error in the problem's composition.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**. This is the best description among the options.\n\n**B. $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}} \\approx 1$, because secondary orbital stabilization and steric strain exactly cancel, making endo and exo retro rates comparable.**\n\n-   **Mechanistic Rationale**: This is incorrect. As shown in the derivation, the effects of steric strain on the ground state ($E_{\\mathrm{endo}} > E_{\\mathrm{exo}}$) and secondary orbital interactions on the transition state ($E_{\\mathrm{TS, endo}} < E_{\\mathrm{TS, exo}}$) are additive, not cancelling. Both effects make the RDA of the *endo* isomer faster. An exact cancellation would be an extraordinary coincidence and is contrary to the general observation for these systems.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}} < 1$, because the exo adduct is less sterically hindered and thus fragments more rapidly by RDA.**\n\n-   **Mechanistic Rationale**: This reasoning is flawed. While the *exo* adduct is indeed less sterically hindered, this means its ground state energy ($E_{\\mathrm{exo}}$) is lower (more stable). A lower starting energy, for a given or higher transition state energy, *increases* the activation energy barrier ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{r, exo}} = E_{\\mathrm{TS, exo}} - E_{\\mathrm{exo}}$), making the reaction *slower*, not faster. This option reverses the consequence of thermodynamic stability on kinetic rate.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}/k_{\\mathrm{exo}} \\approx 0.14$, because entropy dominates RDA and the looser exo transition state has a much larger $T\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ than the endo transition state, overwhelming enthalpic effects.**\n\n-   **Mechanistic Rationale**: This introduces an entropic argument that is not supported by the problem's premises, which focus on energetic (enthalpic) terms $E$. While entropy is part of $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, claiming it dominates and reverses the clear enthalpic trend requires strong justification, which is absent. The assertion of a \"looser\" *exo* transition state is speculative. The primary, well-established differences are electronic and steric effects on the potential energy, which favor a faster *endo* RDA.

This mass, denoted $m_2$, is the sum of the individual exact masses of $\\mathrm{CO}$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{2}$.\nThe exact mass of carbon monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$) is:\n$$m(\\mathrm{CO}) = 1 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) + 1 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{16}O})$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{CO}) = 12.000000000 + 15.99491461957 = 27.99491461957\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\nThe exact mass of acetylene ($\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{2}$) is:\n$$m(\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{2}) = 2 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) + 2 \\times m(\\mathrm{^{1}H})$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{2}) = 2 \\times (12.000000000) + 2 \\times (1.00782503223)$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{2}) = 24.000000000 + 2.01565006446 = 26.01565006446\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\nThe exact mass of the composite loss is the sum of these two masses:\n$$m_2 = m(\\mathrm{CO}) + m(\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{2})$$\n$$m_2 = 27.99491461957 + 26.01565006446$$\n$$m_2 = 54.01056468403\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal uniform ppm accuracy, let's call it $x$, such that the tolerance intervals for the two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, do not overlap. The ppm accuracy relates the mass error, $\\Delta m_{error}$, to the measured mass, $m_{true}$, by the formula:\n$$x = \\frac{\\Delta m_{error}}{m_{true}} \\times 10^6$$\nThis implies that the absolute error for a given ppm accuracy $x$ is $\\Delta m_{error} = m_{true} \\times \\frac{x}{10^6}$.\n\nA symmetric $\\pm x$ ppm tolerance interval around a theoretical mass $m_{true}$ is given by $[m_{true} - m_{true}\\frac{x}{10^6}, m_{true} + m_{true}\\frac{x}{10^6}]$, or $[m_{true}(1-\\frac{x}{10^6}), m_{true}(1+\\frac{x}{10^6})]$.\n\nThe two a priori tolerance intervals are:\n- For $m_1$: $I_1 = [m_1(1-\\frac{x}{10^6}), m_1(1+\\frac{x}{10^6})]$\n- For $m_2$: $I_2 = [m_2(1-\\frac{x}{10^6}), m_2(1+\\frac{x}{10^6})]$\n\nSince $m_1 > m_2$, the condition for these two intervals to be unambiguously distinguishable is that they do not overlap. The threshold for distinguishability is the point where the intervals just touch, meaning the upper bound of the lower-mass interval ($I_2$) is equal to the lower bound of the higher-mass interval ($I_1$):\n$$\\text{upper bound}(I_2) = \\text{lower bound}(I_1)$$\n$$m_2 \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{10^6}\\right) = m_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{10^6}\\right)$$\n\nWe now solve for $x$:\n$$m_2 + m_2 \\frac{x}{10^6} = m_1 - m_1 \\frac{x}{10^6}$$\n$$m_1 \\frac{x}{10^6} + m_2 \\frac{x}{10^6} = m_1 - m_2$$\n$$\\frac{x}{10^6} (m_1 + m_2) = m_1 - m_2$$\n$$x = \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\times 10^6$$\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated values of $m_1$ and $m_2$:\n$$m_1 - m_2 = 54.04695019338 - 54.01056468403 = 0.03638550935\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n$$m_1 + m_2 = 54.04695019338 + 54.01056468403 = 108.05751487741\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n$$x = \\frac{0.03638550935}{108.05751487741} \\times 10^6$$\n$$x \\approx 336.720706 \\text{ ppm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$x \\approx 336.7 \\text{ ppm}$$\n\nTherefore, a mass measurement accuracy of at least $\\pm 336.7$ ppm is required to ensure that the tolerance intervals for the neutral loss assignments of $\\mathrm{C}_{4}\\mathrm{H}_{6}$ and $\\mathrm{CO}+\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ do not overlap, allowing for their unambiguous distinction. Any accuracy value smaller than this (e.g., $100$ ppm, $5$ ppm) would provide even greater separation between the intervals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{336.7}$$", "id": "3721860"}]}
