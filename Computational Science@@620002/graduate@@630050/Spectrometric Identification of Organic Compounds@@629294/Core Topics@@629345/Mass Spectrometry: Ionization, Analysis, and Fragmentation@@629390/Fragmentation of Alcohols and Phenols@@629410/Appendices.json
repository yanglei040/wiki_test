Such ions are termed isobaric. A low-resolution mass spectrometer measures only the nominal mass, which is the integer mass number of the most abundant isotopes, and would therefore be unable to differentiate between isobaric species.\n\nThe ability of HRMS to resolve isobaric ions stems from a fundamental principle of nuclear physics: the **mass defect**. The mass defect, $\\delta$, of a nuclide is the difference between its exact monoisotopic mass, $m_{exact}$, and its mass number, $A$ (the total count of protons and neutrons).\n$$\\delta = m_{exact} - A$$\nThe unified atomic mass unit ($\\mathrm{u}$) is defined such that the mass of a neutral $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom is exactly $12.00000000000\\,\\mathrm{u}$. Therefore, the mass defect of $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ is zero by definition. However, other nuclides have non-zero mass defects due to differences in nuclear binding energy and the proton-neutron mass difference. Using the provided data:\n- For $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$: $\\delta = 1.00782503223\\,\\mathrm{u} - 1 = +0.00782503223\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n- For $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$: $\\delta = 15.99491461957\\,\\mathrm{u} - 16 = -0.00508538043\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n\nEvery unique elemental formula has a unique exact mass because it represents a unique sum of the exact masses (and thus the mass defects) of its constituent atoms. HRMS measures these precise, unique exact masses. For instance, consider the cyclopentadienyl cation, $[\\mathrm{C_{5}H_{5}}]^{+}$, which has a nominal mass of $5 \\times 12 + 5 \\times 1 = 65$. Its exact mass reflects the large positive mass defect of its five hydrogen atoms. From our calculation, its exact $m/z$ is approximately $65.0386\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n\nLet us compare this to a hypothetical isobaric ion, for example, $[\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{13}O}]^{+}$, which also has a nominal mass of $3 \\times 12 + 13 \\times 1 + 16 = 65$. We can calculate its approximate exact mass by summing the constituent atomic masses (neglecting the small electron mass for this conceptual comparison):\n$$m([\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{13}O}]^{+}) \\approx 3 \\cdot m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 13 \\cdot m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + 1 \\cdot m(^{16}\\mathrm{O})$$\n$$m([\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{13}O}]^{+}) \\approx 3(12.000000) + 13(1.007825) + 1(15.994915) \\approx 65.09664\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\nThe difference in mass, $\\Delta m$, between $[\\mathrm{C_{5}H_{5}}]^{+}$ and $[\\mathrm{C_{3}H_{13}O}]^{+}$ is:\n$$\\Delta m \\approx 65.09664 - 65.03858 = 0.05806\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\nTo distinguish these two ions, a mass spectrometer must have sufficient **resolving power**, $R$, which is defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m}$$\nwhere $m$ is the nominal mass of the ions being separated. For this pair of ions at $m/z \\approx 65$:\n$$R = \\frac{65}{0.05806} \\approx 1120$$\nA modern high-resolution mass spectrometer can readily achieve resolving powers in the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands ($R > 20,000$), which is more than sufficient to resolve this mass difference. By measuring an ion's $m/z$ to high precision (e.g., $65.0386\\,\\mathrm{u}$ instead of just $65$), HRMS allows for the unambiguous assignment of an elemental formula, thereby identifying the ion and distinguishing it from all other isobaric possibilities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 93.0335 & 65.0386 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3703190"}]}
