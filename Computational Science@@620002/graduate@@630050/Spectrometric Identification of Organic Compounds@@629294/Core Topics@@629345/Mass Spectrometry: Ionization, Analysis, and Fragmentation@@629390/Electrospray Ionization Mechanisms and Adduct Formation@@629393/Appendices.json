It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary data for a unique solution. The scenario describes a standard high-resolution mass spectrometry experiment. All constants are standard, and the tasks are clear and solvable using first principles of mass spectrometry and isotope distribution theory.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested: calculation of exact masses, analysis of isotopic patterns and resolution, and determination of the mass difference between adducts.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Exact Monoisotopic Masses**\n\nFirst, we calculate the exact monoisotopic mass of the neutral analyte molecule, $M$, with the formula $\\text{C}_{24}\\text{H}_{34}\\text{N}_{2}\\text{O}_{6}$. The monoisotopic mass is the sum of the masses of the most abundant, lightest stable isotopes of each element.\n\nThe monoisotopic mass of $M$, denoted as $m(M)$, is:\n$$m(M) = 24 \\times m({}^{12}\\text{C}) + 34 \\times m({}^{1}\\text{H}) + 2 \\times m({}^{14}\\text{N}) + 6 \\times m({}^{16}\\text{O})$$\nUsing the provided exact masses:\n$$m({}^{12}\\text{C}) = 12.000000000~\\text{Da}$$\n$$m({}^{1}\\text{H}) = 1.007825032~\\text{Da}$$\n$$m({}^{14}\\text{N}) = 14.003074005~\\text{Da}$$\n$$m({}^{16}\\text{O}) = 15.994914620~\\text{Da}$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$m(M) = 24 \\times (12.000000000) + 34 \\times (1.007825032) + 2 \\times (14.003074005) + 6 \\times (15.994914620)$$\n$$m(M) = 288.000000000 + 34.266051088 + 28.006148010 + 95.969487720$$\n$$m(M) = 446.241686818~\\text{Da}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the $m/z$ values for the singly charged monoisotopic adducts $[M+\\text{Na}]^{+}$ and $[M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}$. For a singly charged ion ($z=1$), the $m/z$ value is numerically equal to the ion's mass in Daltons. The ion's mass is the sum of the neutral component masses minus the mass of one electron, $m_e$.\n\nFor the sodium adduct, $[M+\\text{Na}]^{+}$:\n$$m/z([M+\\text{Na}]^{+}) = m(M) + m({}^{23}\\text{Na}) - m_e$$\nUsing $m({}^{23}\\text{Na}) = 22.989769282~\\text{Da}$ and $m_e = 0.000548579909~\\text{Da}$:\n$$m/z([M+\\text{Na}]^{+}) = 446.241686818 + 22.989769282 - 0.000548579909$$\n$$m/z([M+\\text{Na}]^{+}) = 469.230907520~\\text{Da}$$\n\nFor the potassium adduct, $[M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}$:\n$$m/z([M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}) = m(M) + m({}^{39}\\text{K}) - m_e$$\nUsing $m({}^{39}\\text{K}) = 38.963706486~\\text{Da}$:\n$$m/z([M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}) = 446.241686818 + 38.963706486 - 0.000548579909$$\n$$m/z([M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}) = 485.204844724~\\text{Da}$$\n\n**Part 2: Isotopic Pattern Prediction and Resolution Analysis**\n\nThe relative intensities of the isotopic peaks ($M$, $M+1$, $M+2$) are determined by the natural abundances of the heavier isotopes. Let $I(X)$ denote the intensity of peak $X$. We will calculate the ratios $I(M+1)/I(M)$ and $I(M+2)/I(M)$. The probability of the most abundant isotope for each element is $p(\\text{light}) = 1 - \\sum p(\\text{heavy})$.\n$p({}^{12}\\text{C}) = 1 - 0.0107 = 0.9893$\n$p({}^{1}\\text{H}) = 1 - 0.000115 = 0.999885$\n$p({}^{14}\\text{N}) = 1 - 0.00364 = 0.99636$\n$p({}^{16}\\text{O}) = 1 - 0.000380 - 0.00205 = 0.99757$\n\nThe relative intensity of the $M+1$ peak is the sum of probabilities of incorporating one heavy isotope that increases the nominal mass by $1$, relative to the probability of the monoisotopic species.\n$$ \\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)} = n_C \\frac{p({}^{13}\\text{C})}{p({}^{12}\\text{C})} + n_H \\frac{p({}^{2}\\text{H})}{p({}^{1}\\text{H})} + n_N \\frac{p({}^{15}\\text{N})}{p({}^{14}\\text{N})} + n_O \\frac{p({}^{17}\\text{O})}{p({}^{16}\\text{O})} $$\n$$ \\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)} = 24\\frac{0.0107}{0.9893} + 34\\frac{0.000115}{0.999885} + 2\\frac{0.00364}{0.99636} + 6\\frac{0.000380}{0.99757} $$\n$$ \\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)} = 0.259577 + 0.003910 + 0.007306 + 0.002286 = 0.273079 $$\nThe $M+1$ peak intensity is approximately $27.31\\%$ of the monoisotopic peak intensity.\n\nThe relative intensity of the $M+2$ peak is approximated by considering the two main contributions: combinations of two $M+1$ events (dominated by two ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms) and the incorporation of a single $M+2$ isotope (dominated by one ${}^{18}\\text{O}$ atom).\n$$ \\frac{I(M+2)}{I(M)} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)}\\right)^2 + n_O \\frac{p({}^{18}\\text{O})}{p({}^{16}\\text{O})} $$\n$$ \\frac{I(M+2)}{I(M)} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(0.273079)^2 + 6\\frac{0.00205}{0.99757} $$\n$$ \\frac{I(M+2)}{I(M)} \\approx 0.037286 + 0.012330 = 0.049616 $$\nThe $M+2$ peak intensity is approximately $4.96\\%$ of the monoisotopic peak intensity. These ratios apply to the isotope cluster of any adduct, e.g., for both $[M+\\text{Na}]^{+}$ and $[M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}$.\n\nNow we analyze the resolution. The resolving power is $R = m/\\Delta m_{\\text{FWHM}} = 60{,}000$. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a peak, which represents the minimum resolvable mass difference, is $\\Delta m_{\\text{FWHM}} = m/R$.\nFor the $[M+\\text{Na}]^{+}$ cluster around $m/z \\approx 469.23$:\n$$ \\Delta m_{\\text{FWHM}} = \\frac{469.23}{60{,}000} \\approx 0.00782~\\text{Da} $$\n\n$M+1$ fine structure: The $M+1$ peak is a composite of species with one ${}^{13}\\text{C}$, ${}^{2}\\text{H}$, ${}^{15}\\text{N}$, or ${}^{17}\\text{O}$. The mass differences relative to the ${}^{12}\\text{C} \\to {}^{13}\\text{C}$ substitution ($\\Delta m = m({}^{13}\\text{C})-m({}^{12}\\text{C})=1.003355~\\text{Da}$) are:\n- ${}^{1}\\text{H} \\to {}^{2}\\text{H}$: $\\Delta m = 1.006277~\\text{Da}$.

Difference from ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ is $+0.000862~\\text{Da}$.\nAll of these mass differences between fine-structure components are smaller than or on the order of $\\Delta m_{\\text{FWHM}} \\approx 0.00782~\\text{Da}$. Furthermore, the ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ contribution is dominant (~$26\\%$) while all others are minor ($<1\\%$). Therefore, the fine structure of the $M+1$ peak will **not be resolved**, and these components will merge into a single, slightly asymmetric peak.\n\n$M+2$ fine structure: The dominant contributors are two ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ substitutions and one ${}^{18}\\text{O}$ substitution.\n- Two ${}^{13}\\text{C}$: Mass increase is $2 \\times (m({}^{13}\\text{C})-m({}^{12}\\text{C})) = 2 \\times 1.003354835 = 2.00670967~\\text{Da}$.\n- One ${}^{18}\\text{O}$: Mass increase is $m({}^{18}\\text{O})-m({}^{16}\\text{O}) = 17.999159613 - 15.994914620 = 2.004244993~\\text{Da}$.\nThe mass difference between these components is $|2.00670967 - 2.004244993| = 0.002464677~\\text{Da}$.\nSince this difference ($0.00246~\\text{Da}$) is significantly smaller than $\\Delta m_{\\text{FWHM}} \\approx 0.00782~\\text{Da}$, the fine structure of the $M+2$ peak will **not be resolved**.\n\n$[M+\\text{K}]^{+}$ cluster: Potassium has two major isotopes, ${}^{39}\\text{K}$ ($93.26\\%$) and ${}^{41}\\text{K}$ ($6.73\\%$). This results in two distinct adduct clusters, $[M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}$ and $[M+^{41}\\text{K}]^{+}$. The mass difference between their monoisotopic peaks is:\n$$ \\Delta m = m({}^{41}\\text{K}) - m({}^{39}\\text{K}) = 40.961825257 - 38.963706486 = 1.998118771~\\text{Da} $$\nAt $m/z \\approx 485$, $\\Delta m_{\\text{FWHM}} \\approx 485/60000 \\approx 0.0081~\\text{Da}$. Since $\\Delta m \\approx 2~\\text{Da} \\gg \\Delta m_{\\text{FWHM}}$, the two clusters for $[M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}$ and $[M+^{41}\\text{K}]^{+}$ are **fully resolved** and appear as separate isotopic envelopes spaced by $\\approx 2~m/z$ units.\n\n**Part 3: Mass Difference Between Monoisotopic Adduct Peaks**\n\nThe final task is to find the exact $m/z$ difference between the monoisotopic peaks of $[M+\\text{Na}]^{+}$ and $[M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}$.\n$$ \\Delta(m/z) = m/z([M+^{39}\\text{K}]^{+}) - m/z([M+\\text{Na}]^{+}) $$\n$$ \\Delta(m/z) = (m(M) + m({}^{39}\\text{K}) - m_e) - (m(M) + m({}^{23}\\text{Na}) - m_e) $$\nThe mass of the molecule $M$ and the electron mass $m_e$ cancel out:\n$$ \\Delta(m/z) = m({}^{39}\\text{K}) - m({}^{23}\\text{Na}) $$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$ \\Delta(m/z) = 38.963706486 - 22.989769282 = 15.973937204~\\text{Da} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to $6$ significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta(m/z) \\approx 15.9739~\\text{Da} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15.9739}$$", "id": "3700762"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting electrospray ionization spectra often involves distinguishing the desired analyte ion from ubiquitous artifacts that can form in the source, such as those arising from dehydration.

First, use high-purity solvents (e.g., LC-MS grade) and polymer-based vials and tubing (e.g., polypropylene) to stringently minimize sodium contamination. Second, deliberately introduce a low concentration (e.g., $10~\\mu\\text{M}$) of a sodium salt (e.g., $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{COONa}$) into the sample solution.\n    -   **Expected Result**: The relative intensity of the signal corresponding to $[M+\\text{Na}-\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}]^{+}$ will be significantly suppressed under low-sodium conditions and significantly enhanced in the sodium-doped sample when compared to the intensity of the $[M+\\text{H}]^{+}$ signal. This differential response is a strong indicator of the ion's elemental composition.\n\n2.  **Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS)**: The two ions, having different elemental compositions and structures, will exhibit distinct fragmentation patterns upon activation.\n    -   **Proposal**: Perform MS/MS experiments, such as Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID), on each of the two precursor ions. This involves using the mass spectrometer to isolate the m/z value of one precursor ion, subject it to collisions with an inert gas (e.g., $\\text{Ar}$ or $\\text{N}_{2}$), and then analyze the resulting product ions.\n    -   **Expected Result**: The two precursor ions will generate different product ion spectra. For example, the fragmentation of $[M+\\text{H}]^{+}$ will be dictated by the analyte's structure, with common losses corresponding to stable neutral molecules (e.g., loss of $\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$, $\\text{NH}_{3}$, etc.). The fragmentation of the $[M+\\text{Na}-\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}]^{+}$ adduct will be characteristic of a sodiated species; for instance, it might show a different pattern of neutral losses, or potentially a loss of the entire sodiated functional group it is bound to. The difference in the fragmentation pathways and resulting product ion m/z values provides definitive structural evidence to distinguish the two parent ions.\n\nCombining these two approaches provides an unambiguous assignment of the observed signals.
