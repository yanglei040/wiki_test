The provided chemical shift values are chemically plausible and consistent with standard empirical data for organic functional groups. A methine carbon attached to an oxygen atom typically resonates in the range $50-90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, and its attached proton resonates in the range $3.4-4.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. The given values of $75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ fall squarely within these ranges. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a coherent set of spectral data and asks for an interpretation and proposal of a confirmatory experiment. The information is sufficient to allow for a logical deduction and to distinguish between the proposed options. A unique, best answer can be determined.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard terminology from the field of organic spectroscopy. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard problem in structural elucidation using NMR spectroscopy. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core of the problem is the identification of a specific $\\mathrm{CH}$ group based on its NMR spectral data.\nThe HSQC experiment confirms a direct, one-bond connection ($^{1}J_{CH}$) between the proton at $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and the carbon at $75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. We must interpret these chemical shifts to determine the local chemical environment of this $\\mathrm{CH}$ group.\n\n**Analysis of Chemical Shifts:**\n1.  **The Carbon Shift ($\\delta_C = 75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$):** In $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR, aliphatic carbons (sp³-hybridized) typically resonate in the range $5-60\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. A chemical shift of $75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ for a methine ($\\mathrm{CH}$) carbon is significantly downfield. This large deshielding effect is characteristic of a carbon atom directly bonded to a highly electronegative atom, most commonly oxygen.\n2.  **The Proton Shift ($\\delta_H = 3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$):** Similarly, protons on sp³-hybridized carbons typically resonate in the range $0.8-1.7\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. A chemical shift of $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is strongly deshielded. This is characteristic of a proton on a carbon that is directly bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen ($\\mathrm{H-C-O}$).\n\n**Evaluation of Possible Structures:**\n-   **Benzylic $\\mathrm{CH}$ without oxygen ($\\mathrm{Ar-CH(R_1)(R_2)}$):** A benzylic carbon's chemical shift is typically in the $30-45\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range. The corresponding benzylic proton shift is typically $2.2-3.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. The observed shifts of $75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($\\mathrm{C}$) and $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ ($\\mathrm{H}$) are both far too downfield to be explained by proximity to an aromatic ring alone. This classification is not plausible.\n-   **Ether Carbon ($\\mathrm{R_1-O-CH(R_2)(R_3)}$):** A methine carbon bonded to an ether oxygen atom exhibits a chemical shift in the $60-90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range. The proton attached to this carbon resonates in the $3.4-4.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range. The observed data ($75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$) are fully consistent with this classification.\n-   **Alcohol Carbon ($\\mathrm{HO-CH(R_1)(R_2)}$):** A methine carbon bonded to a hydroxyl group shows a chemical shift in the $50-85\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range. The proton on this carbon resonates in the $3.4-4.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range. The observed data are also fully consistent with this classification.\n\n**Distinguishing Between Alcohol and Ether:**\nBoth alcohol and ether classifications are plausible based on the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ and $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ shifts of the $\\mathrm{CH}$ group. The decisive information must come from an experiment that can differentiate between a hydroxyl group ($\\mathrm{OH}$) and an ether linkage ($\\mathrm{C-O-C}$). The HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation) experiment is ideal for this, as it detects correlations between protons and carbons over two or three bonds ($^{2}J_{CH}$ and $^{3}J_{CH}$).\n\n-   **For an alcohol:** The hydroxyl proton ($\\mathrm{OH}$) is two bonds away from the carbinol carbon ($\\mathrm{H-O-C}$). An HMBC experiment can detect this $^{2}J_{CH}$ coupling, which would appear as a cross-peak between the chemical shift of the $\\mathrm{OH}$ proton and the chemical shift of the carbon at $75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This is a definitive confirmation of an alcohol. The $\\mathrm{OH}$ proton is labile, its shift is variable, and it does not show a one-bond correlation in HSQC, all of which are well-known properties.\n-   **For an ether:** There is no hydroxyl proton. To confirm an ether linkage, one would look for a $^{3}J_{CH}$ correlation from a proton on one side of the ether oxygen to a carbon on the other side. For example, in an ethyl methyl ether ($\\mathrm{CH_3-O-CH_2CH_3}$), the methyl protons ($\\mathrm{CH_3-O}$) would show a $^{3}J_{CH}$ HMBC correlation to the methylene carbon ($\\mathrm{-O-CH_2-}$).\n\nThe question asks for a *single decisive* HMBC correlation. The correlation involving the unique hydroxyl proton in an alcohol is the most direct and unambiguous test to distinguish it from an ether.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A benzylic $\\mathrm{CH}$ adjacent to an aromatic ring without oxygen; confirm by observing an HMBC cross-peak from the $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ benzylic proton to the aromatic ipso carbon around $145\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.**\nThe classification as a benzylic $\\mathrm{CH}$ without oxygen is inconsistent with the provided chemical shifts ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ at $75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ at $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$). These values are too far downfield. Therefore, the premise of this option is incorrect.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. An alkyl aryl ether $\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$; confirm by observing an HMBC cross-peak from the $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ methine proton to a methoxy carbon near $55\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.**\nThis option presents an internal contradiction. It first classifies the group as part of an \"alkyl aryl ether\" ($\\mathrm{Ar-O-R}$), but then proposes an HMBC correlation to a \"methoxy carbon\" ($\\mathrm{-OCH_3}$). A methoxy carbon implies a methyl ether ($\\mathrm{CH_3-O-R}$), which is a dialkyl ether or an alkyl aryl ether of the type $\\mathrm{Ar-CH(OCH_3)-R}$. More importantly, there is no information given in the problem statement to suggest the presence of a methoxy group (e.g., a singlet for three protons in the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ spectrum, or a $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ signal near $50-60\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ in the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ spectrum). This proposal relies on an unstated assumption.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. A secondary alcohol $\\mathrm{R}_{2}\\mathrm{CH}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{OH}$; confirm by observing an HMBC cross-peak from an exchangeable $\\mathrm{OH}$ proton (typically $1$–$3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, no HSQC) to the $75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ methine carbon via $^{2}J_{CH}$ across $\\mathrm{H}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{O}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{C}$.**\nThe classification as a secondary alcohol is highly plausible based on the provided chemical shifts. The proposed confirmatory experiment is the standard, text-book method for unambiguously identifying an alcohol functionality and linking the hydroxyl group to its specific carbon atom. The description of the experiment is precise: the correlation is from the exchangeable $\\mathrm{OH}$ proton to the carbinol carbon at $75\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ via the two-bond `H-O-C` coupling pathway. This experiment is decisive.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. A benzylic $\\mathrm{CH}$ whose downfield carbon shift is caused solely by aromatic ring-current anisotropy; confirm by observing HMBC correlations from the $3.65\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ proton to multiple aromatic carbons between $126\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and $140\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.**\nThe explanation for the chemical shift is scientifically flawed. Aromatic ring-current anisotropy is a through-space effect that primarily influences $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ chemical shifts, not $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ shifts. It cannot account for a $\\sim 30-40\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ downfield shift of a carbon atom. Moreover, the proposed confirmation (HMBC from the methine proton to aromatic carbons) would also be observed in a benzylic alcohol ($\\mathrm{Ar-CH(OH)-R}$). Therefore, this observation would not be decisive in ruling out the presence of an oxygen atom.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "3697847"}, {"introduction": "After identifying individual spin systems, the next crucial step is piecing them together to map the carbon skeleton.

This pattern is classically indicative of a monosubstituted benzene ring ($\\mathrm{C_6H_5}$- or phenyl group).\n    *   The $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR and DEPT data support this assignment. There are signals for five protonated aromatic carbons ($\\mathrm{CH}$) in the range $\\delta\\,126$–$129$ and one non-protonated (quaternary) aromatic carbon at $\\delta\\,139.5$. The total of six aromatic carbons is consistent with a benzene ring substituted at one position. The quaternary carbon at $\\delta\\,139.5$ is the attachment point, the *ipso*-carbon.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   The $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum displays two distinct signals at $\\delta\\,1.28$ and $\\delta\\,1.33$.\n    *   Each signal integrates to $3\\mathrm{H}$, indicating the presence of two methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$) groups.\n    *   Crucially, both signals are singlets. A singlet multiplicity means that the carbon adjacent to each methyl group bears no protons. Therefore, both methyl groups must be attached to a quaternary carbon.\n    *   The fact that the two methyl groups have different chemical shifts means they are chemically non-equivalent. For two methyl groups attached to the same carbon (a gem-dimethyl group) to be non-equivalent, that carbon must be a prochiral center. This happens if the quaternary carbon is bonded to four different groups in total (e.g., $-\\mathrm{C(A)(B)(CH_3)(CH_3)}$, where $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}$).\n    *   The $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR data corroborates this: there are two distinct methyl carbon signals at $\\delta\\,29.7$ and $\\delta\\,31.2$, and a non-protonated $sp^3$ carbon signal at $\\delta\\,42.5$. The HSQC data confirms the one-bond connectivity between the proton at $\\delta\\,1.28$ and the carbon at $\\delta\\,29.7$, and between the proton at $\\delta\\,1.33$ and the carbon at $\\delta\\,31.2$.\n\n3.  **Structural Assembly using HMBC Data:**\n    *   The HMBC spectrum provides the long-range correlations needed to connect the molecular fragments. The problem states that the protons of both methyl groups ($\\delta\\,1.28$ and $\\delta\\,1.33$) show correlations to two specific carbons: the quaternary $sp^3$ carbon at $\\delta\\,42.5$ and the quaternary aromatic carbon at $\\delta\\,139.5$.\n    *   The correlation from the methyl protons ($\\mathrm{H-C_{methyl}}$) to the quaternary $sp^3$ carbon ($\\delta\\,42.5$) is a two-bond correlation ($^2J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$). This confirms that both methyl groups are directly attached to this carbon ($\\delta\\,42.5$), forming a gem-dimethyl group: $-\\mathrm{C(CH_3)_2}$.\n    *   The correlation from the methyl protons to the quaternary aromatic *ipso*-carbon ($\\delta\\,139.5$) must be a three-bond correlation ($^3J_{\\mathrm{CH}}$). The path for this correlation is $\\mathrm{H_3C}-C_{sp^3,quat}-C_{arom,quat}$. This proves that the quaternary $sp^3$ carbon (at $\\delta\\,42.5$) is directly bonded to the phenyl group at its *ipso*-carbon (at $\\delta\\,139.5$).\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the Skeleton:**\n    *   Combining all the pieces of evidence, the skeleton must be a phenyl group attached to a quaternary $sp^3$ carbon, which itself bears two non-equivalent methyl groups. This corresponds to the general structure $\\mathrm{C_6H_5}-\\mathrm{C(R)(CH_3)_2}$, where $\\mathrm{R}$ is a substituent other than $\\mathrm{H}$ or $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ to ensure the prochirality that makes the methyl groups non-equivalent. The position of the quaternary $sp^3$ carbon, attached to the aromatic ring, is known as a benzylic position.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A.

An additional singlet at $\\delta = 3.80\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ ($3\\ \\mathrm{H}$) is observed. Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR, $125\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$): in the aromatic region, exactly four resonances are observed at $\\delta = 160.2,\\ 131.5,\\ 128.4,\\ 114.7\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT-$135$) indicates that two of these aromatic resonances are due to $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons and two are quaternary carbons.

Your reasoning must be grounded in the following foundational bases:\n- In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), magnetically equivalent nuclei correspond to positions that are related by symmetry operations of the molecular permutation-inversion group that leave the spin Hamiltonian invariant; the number of distinct resonances equals the number of inequivalent positions (orbits) under that group action.\n- Aromatic proton coupling topologies depend on adjacency: ortho couplings ($^{3}J$) are typically $\\approx 7$–$9\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, while meta couplings ($^{4}J$) are smaller and often resolve additional splittings.\n\nLink the observed $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ degeneracy to the symmetry (point group) of the aromatic substructure and use group-theoretical arguments to justify the degeneracy pattern.\n\nWhich option best fits all the data and the group-theoretical degeneracy analysis?\n\nA.

It presents a standard spectroscopic puzzle solvable using established principles of NMR spectroscopy and group theory. The data are internally consistent and physically realistic for an organic molecule.\n\n- **Factual Soundness**: The chemical shifts ($\\delta$), coupling constants ($J$), and integration values are typical for a substituted benzene derivative. The use of point groups to predict spectral degeneracy is a cornerstone of chemical spectroscopy.\n- **Consistency**: The $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR shows a total of $4$ aromatic protons, which requires $4$ $\\mathrm{CH}$ groups on the benzene ring. This leaves $6 - 4 = 2$ positions for substituents, which must be quaternary carbons. The $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and DEPT-135 data report $4$ aromatic signals in total, comprised of $2$ distinct types of $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons and $2$ distinct types of quaternary carbons. For there to be $4$ $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons giving rise to only $2$ signals, they must exist as two symmetry-equivalent pairs. For there to be $2$ quaternary carbons giving rise to $2$ signals, they must be symmetry-inequivalent. This data set is fully self-consistent and points towards a specific molecular symmetry.\n- **Completeness**: Sufficient data is provided to determine the substitution pattern and relative nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring, which is the core task. The problem does not contain any contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe solution requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectral data and a comparison with theoretical predictions for different substitution patterns based on symmetry.\n\n**1. Interpretation of Spectral Data**\n- The signal at $\\delta = 3.80\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ ($3\\mathrm{H}$, singlet) in the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR and the corresponding signal at $\\delta = 55.1\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ in the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR are characteristic of a methoxy group ($\\mathrm{-OCH_3}$).\n- The signal at $\\delta = 190.2\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon ($\\mathrm{C=O}$), likely a ketone or an aldehyde, in conjugation with the aromatic ring.\n- The two substituents on the benzene ring are therefore different: one is a methoxy group, and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. Let's denote them as $X = \\mathrm{-OCH_3}$ and $Y = \\mathrm{-C(O)R}$.\n\n- The aromatic region of the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum shows two doublets, each integrating to $2\\mathrm{H}$. This pattern ($2\\mathrm{H}+2\\mathrm{H}$) indicates that the $4$ aromatic protons are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. The coupling constant, $J = 8.4\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, is a typical value for ortho-coupling ($^3J$). A pattern of two doublets with only ortho-coupling is the classic signature of a $1,4$- (para) disubstituted benzene ring. This arrangement places the two protons of one type ortho to one substituent and the two protons of the other type ortho to the second substituent.\n\n- The $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR shows $4$ distinct signals in the aromatic region for the $6$ carbons of the benzene ring. This implies symmetry. The DEPT-135 experiment confirms that these $4$ signals arise from $2$ inequivalent quaternary carbons and $2$ inequivalent sets of protonated carbons ($\\mathrm{CH}$). This is consistent with the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ data: the $4$ total $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons on the ring must be grouped into two pairs of two equivalent carbons, giving rise to two signals. The $2$ substituted (quaternary) carbons must be inequivalent, giving rise to two separate signals. Total signals: $2$ (from $\\mathrm{CH}$) + $2$ (from $\\mathrm{C_{quat}}$) = $4$. This matches the data.\n\n**2. Symmetry Analysis of Substitution Patterns**\nWe will now use group theory to determine which substitution pattern is consistent with the observed spectral degeneracies. Let the six carbon atoms of the benzene ring be labeled $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5, C_6$ consecutively. The number of unique NMR signals corresponds to the number of orbits of atoms under the action of the molecular point group.\n\n- **Case I: Para-disubstituted, different substituents ($X$ on $C_1$, $Y$ on $C_4$)**\n  The point group of this substructure is $C_{2v}$. The relevant symmetry operations for permuting ring atoms are the identity ($E$) and a $180^\\circ$ rotation ($C_2$) about the axis passing through $C_1$ and $C_4$.\n  - Action of $C_2$: $C_1 \\to C_1$, $C_4 \\to C_4$, $C_2 \\leftrightarrow C_6$, $C_3 \\leftrightarrow C_5$.\n  - Orbits (sets of equivalent carbons): {$C_1$}, {$C_4$}, {$C_2, C_6$}, {$C_3, C_5$}.\n  - $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Prediction: There are $4$ inequivalent carbon positions. $C_1$ and $C_4$ are quaternary, and since they are in separate orbits, they are inequivalent ($2$ quaternary signals). The $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons form two orbits, {$C_2, C_6$} and {$C_3, C_5$}, and are thus inequivalent ($2$ $\\mathrm{CH}$ signals). Total: $4$ signals ($2$ quaternary, $2$ $\\mathrm{CH}$). This prediction matches the experimental data exactly.\n  - $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ Prediction: Protons on {$C_2, C_6$} are equivalent, and protons on {$C_3, C_5$} are equivalent. This results in two sets of protons, each of integration $2\\mathrm{H}$. Each proton has one ortho neighbor, giving a pattern of two doublets. This matches the experimental data.\n\n- **Case II: Para-disubstituted, identical substituents ($X$ on $C_1$, $X$ on $C_4$)**\n  The point group is $D_{2h}$. This group has higher symmetry, including a $C_2$ axis perpendicular to the $C_1-C_4$ axis and a center of inversion $i$.\n  - Action of symmetry: The operations interconvert $C_1 \\leftrightarrow C_4$ and also place all four $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons into a single orbit.\n  - Orbits: {$C_1, C_4$}, {$C_2, C_3, C_5, C_6$}.\n  - $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Prediction: A total of $2$ signals ($1$ quaternary, $1$ $\\mathrm{CH}$). This contradicts the observed $4$ signals.\n\n- **Case III: Meta-disubstituted, identical substituents ($X$ on $C_1$, $X$ on $C_3$)**\n  The point group is $C_{2v}$. The $C_2$ axis passes through $C_2$ and $C_5$.\n  - Action of $C_2$: $C_2 \\to C_2$, $C_5 \\to C_5$, $C_1 \\leftrightarrow C_3$, $C_6 \\leftrightarrow C_4$.\n  - Orbits: {$C_1, C_3$}, {$C_2$}, {$C_5$}, {$C_4, C_6$}.\n  - $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Prediction: A total of $4$ signals. The composition is $1$ quaternary signal (from {$C_1, C_3$}) and $3$ $\\mathrm{CH}$ signals (from {$C_2$}, {$C_5$}, and {$C_4, C_6$}). This contradicts the DEPT data, which requires $2$ quaternary signals and $2$ $\\mathrm{CH}$ signals.\n\n- **Case IV: Ortho-disubstituted, different substituents ($X$ on $C_1$, $Y$ on $C_2$)**\n  The point group is $C_{s}$ (the only symmetry element being the molecular plane). This symmetry does not interchange any of the carbon atoms of the ring.\n  - Orbits: {$C_1$}, {$C_2$}, {$C_3$}, {$C_4$}, {$C_5$}, {$C_6$}.\n  - $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Prediction: All $6$ carbons are inequivalent, predicting $6$ signals ($2$ quaternary, $4$ $\\mathrm{CH}$). This contradicts the observed $4$ signals.\n\nThe only case that matches all experimental evidence ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR pattern, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signal count, and DEPT-135 composition) is the para-disubstituted benzene ring with different substituents.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Para-disubstituted benzene with different substituents on the ring (point group $C_{2v}$ for the aromatic substructure). Predicts four inequivalent aromatic $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ positions and an $\\mathrm{AA'}\\mathrm{BB'}$ pattern in $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ with two doublets ($2\\ \\mathrm{H}$ each) of similar $J$.**\nAs derived above, the $C_{2v}$ symmetry of a para-disubstituted ring with different substituents leads to four inequivalent carbon orbits: two for the inequivalent quaternary carbons ($C_1, C_4$) and two for the two pairs of equivalent $\\mathrm{CH}$ carbons ( {$C_2, C_6$} and {$C_3, C_5$} ). This predicts four $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signals, with two being quaternary and two being $\\mathrm{CH}$, which perfectly matches the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and DEPT data. The proton environment consists of two sets of two equivalent protons, which, given the large ortho coupling and significant chemical shift difference due to the electronically dissimilar substituents, simplifies to the observed two doublets of $2\\mathrm{H}$ intensity each. This option is fully consistent with all data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Para-disubstituted benzene with identical substituents on the ring (point group $D_{2h}$ for the aromatic substructure). Predicts three inequivalent aromatic $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ positions and an $\\mathrm{AA'}\\mathrm{BB'}$ $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ pattern with two doublets ($2\\ \\mathrm{H}$ each).**\nThis option has multiple flaws. First, the data indicates the substituents are different ($\\mathrm{-OCH_3}$ and a carbonyl group). Second, the $D_{2h}$ symmetry for this pattern predicts only two inequivalent carbon positions, not three as stated in the option, and certainly not the four observed experimentally.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Meta-disubstituted benzene with identical substituents on the ring (point group $C_{2v}$ for the aromatic substructure). Predicts four inequivalent aromatic $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ positions and an aromatic $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ pattern not consisting of two equal-intensity doublets due to meta couplings.**\nWhile the predicted number of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signals is $4$, the symmetry analysis for this case shows they would be composed of $1$ quaternary type and $3$ $\\mathrm{CH}$ types. This contradicts the DEPT data of $2$ quaternary and $2$ $\\mathrm{CH}$ types. Furthermore, the expected $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ spectrum would be more complex than two doublets (e.g., three signals with intensity $1:1:2$) and would involve smaller meta-couplings, which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum. Finally, the substituents are not identical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Ortho-disubstituted benzene with different substituents on the ring (point group $C_{s}$ for the aromatic substructure). Predicts six inequivalent aromatic $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ positions and a complex $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ pattern with multiple couplings.**\nThe low symmetry ($C_{s}$) of this pattern means all six aromatic carbons are inequivalent, predicting six $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ signals. This is in direct contradiction to the four signals observed. The four inequivalent aromatic protons would also produce a complex multiplet pattern, not two simple doublets.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3697884"}]}
