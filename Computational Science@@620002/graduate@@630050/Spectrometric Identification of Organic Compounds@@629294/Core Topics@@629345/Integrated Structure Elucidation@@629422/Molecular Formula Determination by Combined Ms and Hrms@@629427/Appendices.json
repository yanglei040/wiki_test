The data provided are consistent with established physical constants and typical instrumental parameters.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of the Molecular Formula**\n\nThe proposed neutral molecular formula is $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The problem analyzes the protonated molecular ion, $\\mathrm{[M+H]^{+}}$, which would have the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{13}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}$. We must verify that this assignment is consistent with all three pieces of experimental evidence: the high-resolution mass, the isotopic abundance ratio, and the nitrogen rule.\n\nFirst, we calculate the theoretical exact mass of the proposed ion and compare it to the experimental value. The mass of the ion is the sum of the masses of its constituent atoms. Crucially, the problem specifies the mass of $\\mathrm{[M+H]^{+}}$ is derived from the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$ being protonated. The mass of this ion is the mass of the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$ plus the mass of a proton.\n\nThe monoisotopic mass of the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is calculated using the provided atomic masses:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{M}} = 10 \\times m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 12 \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + 2 \\times m(^{14}\\mathrm{N}) + 2 \\times m(^{16}\\mathrm{O})$$\n$$m_{\\mathrm{M}} = 10 \\times 12.000000 + 12 \\times 1.00782503223 + 2 \\times 14.00307400443 + 2 \\times 15.99491461957$$\n$$m_{\\mathrm{M}} = 120.000000 + 12.09390038676 + 28.00614800886 + 31.98982923914 = 192.08987763476 \\; \\mathrm{u}$$\nThe theoretical mass of the protonated ion $\\mathrm{[M+H]^{+}}$ is the mass of the neutral molecule plus the mass of a proton ($m_p = 1.00727646688 \\; \\mathrm{u}$):\n$$m_{\\mathrm{theor}} = m_{\\mathrm{M}} + m_{p} = 192.08987763476 + 1.00727646688 = 193.09715410164 \\; \\mathrm{u}$$\nThe experimental mass is $m_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 193.0972 \\; \\mathrm{u}$. The mass error in parts-per-million (ppm) is:\n$$\\mathrm{Error (ppm)} = \\frac{|m_{\\mathrm{theor}} - m_{\\mathrm{exp}}|}{m_{\\mathrm{theor}}} \\times 10^6 = \\frac{|193.097154 - 193.0972|}{193.097154} \\times 10^6 \\approx 0.24 \\; \\mathrm{ppm}$$\nThis error of $0.24 \\; \\mathrm{ppm}$ is well within the specified instrument accuracy of $\\pm 2 \\; \\mathrm{ppm}$, confirming the mass-to-charge ratio supports the proposed formula.\n\nSecond, we check the isotopic abundance ratio. The intensity of the $\\mathrm{M+1}$ peak relative to the main $\\mathrm{M}$ peak (here, `M` refers to the $\\mathrm{[M+H]^{+}}$ peak) is primarily due to the natural abundances of ${}^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, ${}^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, and ${}^{17}\\mathrm{O}$ (with ${}^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ being negligible as stated). For the ion $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{13}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}$, the theoretical ratio is approximated by:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{I(M+1)}}{\\mathrm{I(M)}} \\approx 10 \\times A(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) + 2 \\times A(^{15}\\mathrm{N}) + 2 \\times A(^{17}\\mathrm{O})$$\nUsing the provided fractional abundances:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{I(M+1)}}{\\mathrm{I(M)}} \\approx 10 \\times 0.0109 + 2 \\times 0.00368 + 2 \\times 0.00038$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{I(M+1)}}{\\mathrm{I(M)}} \\approx 0.109 + 0.00736 + 0.00076 = 0.11712$$\nThe calculated ratio of $0.11712$ is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of $0.118$, further corroborating the formula.\n\nThird, we apply the nitrogen rule. The nominal mass of the observed ion $\\mathrm{[M+H]^{+}}$ is $193$, which is an odd number. As protonation increases the nominal mass by one unit, the nominal mass of the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$ must be $193 - 1 = 192$, an even number. According to the nitrogen rule, a neutral molecule with an even nominal mass must contain an even number of nitrogen atoms (or zero). The proposed formula $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ contains two nitrogen atoms, which is an even number. This is consistent with the nitrogen rule.\n\nThe combined evidence from high-resolution mass, isotopic pattern, and the nitrogen rule provides a robust justification for the molecular formula $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for the neutral compound. While a comprehensive search would be needed to prove uniqueness absolutely, the tight constraints make this assignment highly probable and the only plausible one among simple combinations of C, H, N, and O.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) Formula**\n\nThe Double Bond Equivalent (DBE), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the number of rings plus the number of $\\pi$ bonds in a molecule. It is calculated by comparing the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule to the number required for a corresponding saturated, acyclic structure.\n\nLet the molecular formula be $\\mathrm{C}_{x}\\mathrm{H}_{y}\\mathrm{N}_{z}\\mathrm{O}_{q}$.\n1.  **Reference Saturated Acyclic Alkane:** For a molecule with $x$ carbon atoms, the fully saturated acyclic alkane has the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{x}\\mathrm{H}_{2x+2}$. This structure has a DBE of $0$.\n2.  **Effect of Oxygen:** An oxygen atom is divalent. It can be inserted into a C-C bond (forming an ether) or a C-H bond (forming an alcohol) without changing the number of hydrogen atoms required for saturation. For example, ethane ($\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{6}$) and ethanol ($\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{5}\\mathrm{OH}$, or $\\mathrm{C}_{2}\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\mathrm{O}$) are both saturated. Thus, oxygen atoms do not affect the DBE calculation and can be ignored.\n3.  **Effect of Nitrogen:** A nitrogen atom is trivalent. When a nitrogen atom is introduced into a saturated hydrocarbon chain, it replaces a CH group with an N atom and adds a bond to an additional hydrogen to satisfy its valency, or replaces a CH2 group with NH. Let's consider inserting it into a C-H bond of an alkane $\\mathrm{C}_x\\mathrm{H}_{2x+2}$. This creates an amine $\\mathrm{C}_x\\mathrm{H}_{2x+1}\\mathrm{NH}_2$, which has the formula $\\mathrm{C}_x\\mathrm{H}_{2x+3}\\mathrm{N}$. For each nitrogen atom added, one additional hydrogen atom is required for saturation compared to the parent alkane. Therefore, for a saturated, acyclic molecule with $x$ carbons and $z$ nitrogens, the number of hydrogens is $H_{\\mathrm{sat}} = (2x+2) + z$.\n4.  **Hydrogen Deficiency:** The actual number of hydrogens in the molecule is $y$. The hydrogen deficiency is the difference between the number of hydrogens in the saturated reference and the actual number:\n$$\\text{Deficiency} = H_{\\mathrm{sat}} - y = (2x + 2 + z) - y$$\n5.  **DBE Calculation:** Each double bond or ring in a molecule reduces the number of hydrogen atoms by two. Therefore, the DBE is half of the total hydrogen deficiency.\n$$\\mathrm{DBE} = \\frac{\\text{Deficiency}}{2} = \\frac{(2x + 2 + z) - y}{2}$$\nThis simplifies to the general expression for the Double Bond Equivalent:\n$$\\mathrm{DBE} = x - \\frac{y}{2} + \\frac{z}{2} + 1$$\n\n**Part 3: DBE Calculation and Chemical Interpretation**\n\nWe now compute the DBE for the determined molecular formula $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$.\nUsing the derived formula with $x=10$, $y=12$, and $z=2$:\n$$\\mathrm{DBE} = 10 - \\frac{12}{2} + \\frac{2}{2} + 1$$\n$$\\mathrm{DBE} = 10 - 6 + 1 + 1$$\n$$\\mathrm{DBE} = 6$$\n\nA DBE value of $6$ indicates a significant degree of unsaturation. The problem asks whether this is consistent with the presence of a benzene ring. A benzene ring ($\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{6}$) consists of one ring and three $\\pi$ bonds, contributing a total of $4$ to the DBE.\nIf the molecule $\\mathrm{C}_{10}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ contains a benzene ring, $4$ units of unsaturation are accounted for. This leaves $6 - 4 = 2$ additional units of unsaturation. These two units can be attributed to other structural features, such as:\n-   Two double bonds (e.g., two carbonyls $\\mathrm{C=O}$, or an imine $\\mathrm{C=N}$ and a carbonyl $\\mathrm{C=O}$).\n-   One triple bond (e.g., a nitrile $\\mathrm{C \\equiv N}$).\n-   Two additional rings.\n-   One additional ring and one double bond.\n\nFor example, a structure with a disubstituted benzene ring ($\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{4}$) and two substituents with the total formula $\\mathrm{C}_{4}\\mathrm{H}_{8}\\mathrm{N}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is perfectly plausible. The remaining two DBEs could easily reside in these substituents, for example as two amide groups. Therefore, a DBE of $6$ is entirely consistent with the presence of a benzene ring motif within the molecular structure. In fact, a DBE of $4$ or greater is a common indicator suggesting the possibility of an aromatic ring.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$", "id": "3713581"}, {"introduction": "This final practice explores the advanced capabilities of ultra-high-resolution instruments, which can resolve the isotopic fine structure of a molecule.

This conclusion is further supported by the information from low-resolution mass spectrometry, which did not show the characteristic high-intensity $A$:$A+2$ patterns of chlorine or bromine.
