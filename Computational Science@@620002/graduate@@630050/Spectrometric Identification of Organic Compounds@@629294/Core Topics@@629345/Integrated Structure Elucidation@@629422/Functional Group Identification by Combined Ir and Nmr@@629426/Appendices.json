It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard chemical analysis technique ($\\mathrm{D_2O}$ exchange for identifying labile protons) and provides realistic spectroscopic data. The question requires applying fundamental principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy to interpret the results.\n\nThe central task is to determine which set of spectroscopic changes most convincingly confirms the presence of an exchangeable proton on an oxygen atom, i.e., an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ group, based on the provided experimental observations and first principles. The experiment involves comparing spectra before and after shaking the sample with deuterium oxide ($\\mathrm{D_2O}$).\n\nThe chemical process underlying the experiment is an acid-base equilibrium involving the analyte, assumed to be an alcohol $\\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!H}$, and $\\mathrm{D_2O}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!H} + \\mathrm{D_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!D} + \\mathrm{HOD} $$\nGiven that a small aliquot of $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ is used, which acts as the solvent for the exchange, deuterium is in vast excess. Le Châtelier's principle dictates that the equilibrium will be driven strongly to the right, converting nearly all of the $\\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!H}$ species into $\\mathrm{R\\!-\\!O\\!-\\!D}$. We must now analyze the expected spectroscopic consequences of this isotopic substitution.\n\n**Analysis of ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe problem states as a first principle that ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR detects transitions of spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ hydrogen nuclei (${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$) and does not record deuterium (${}^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ or $\\mathrm{D}$), a spin-$1$ nucleus, at the operating frequency of a ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrometer. The gyromagnetic ratio of deuterium is significantly different from that of a proton.\n\nBefore the exchange, the spectrum shows a broad singlet at $\\delta \\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ integrating to approximately $1$ proton. This is characteristic of an alcohol proton, which is often broadened due to hydrogen bonding and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid or water. After shaking with $\\mathrm{D_2O}$, the proton of the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ group is replaced with a deuteron, forming an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ group. Since the deuteron is not detected in the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum, the signal corresponding to the hydroxyl proton should vanish. The observed disappearance of the broad singlet at $\\delta \\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ is therefore direct evidence that this proton is \"exchangeable\" and has been replaced by deuterium. This matches the experimental data provided.\n\n**Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n\nThe problem provides the harmonic oscillator model for the vibrational wavenumber of a diatomic-like stretch:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the bond force constant and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass. For a bond between two atoms of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$, $\\mu = \\dfrac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$.\n\nAccording to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the electronic structure and thus the bond force constant $k$ are nearly identical for an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ bond and an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ bond. The significant change is in the reduced mass.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio of the vibrational wavenumbers, $\\dfrac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}$.\n$$ \\dfrac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}}} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}} $$\nWe use the atomic masses for hydrogen ($m_H \\approx 1.008\\,\\mathrm{amu}$), deuterium ($m_D \\approx 2.014\\,\\mathrm{amu}$), and oxygen ($m_O \\approx 15.999\\,\\mathrm{amu}$).\n\nThe reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ bond is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}} = \\dfrac{m_O m_H}{m_O + m_H} \\approx \\dfrac{16 \\times 1}{16 + 1} = \\dfrac{16}{17} \\approx 0.941\\,\\mathrm{amu} $$\nThe reduced mass for the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ bond is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}} = \\dfrac{m_O m_D}{m_O + m_D} \\approx \\dfrac{16 \\times 2}{16 + 2} = \\dfrac{32}{18} = \\dfrac{16}{9} \\approx 1.778\\,\\mathrm{amu} $$\nThe ratio of the wavenumbers is therefore:\n$$ \\dfrac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\dfrac{16/17}{32/18}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{16}{17} \\times \\dfrac{18}{32}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{9}{17}} \\approx 0.728 $$\nA common and simpler approximation assumes the oxygen atom is infinitely heavy compared to H or D, giving $\\dfrac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\dfrac{m_H}{m_D}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{2}} \\approx 0.707$. Both approximations predict a substantial decrease in frequency.\n\nGiven the initial $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch is near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, the new $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ stretch is predicted to appear at:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-D}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{O-H}} \\times \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-H}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{O-D}}}} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}} \\times 0.728 \\approx 2512\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}} $$\nThe experimental observation of the disappearance of the band at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and the appearance of a new band near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is in excellent agreement with this theoretical prediction. This strongly confirms that the vibration being observed is indeed an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch, which has been converted to an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ stretch.\n\nThe combination of the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR signal disappearance and the predictable frequency shift in the IR spectrum provides unambiguous and corroborating evidence for the presence of an exchangeable $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR signal assigned to $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ disappears, and the IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is replaced by an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, consistent with the predicted isotopic frequency ratio from the harmonic oscillator model.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with our derivation from first principles and with the provided experimental data. The disappearance of the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR signal confirms the exchangeable nature of the proton. The replacement of the IR band at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3450\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ with one at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ confirms the identity of the bond as $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ based on the mass-dependent frequency shift.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ resonance shifts downfield and becomes sharp due to reduced exchange, while the IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ band remains at the same frequency and narrows.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR signal for the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ proton disappears; it does not shift or sharpen. Adding $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ would increase, not decrease, the rate of exchange. Second, the IR $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretching band is replaced by an $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ band at a significantly lower frequency; it does not remain the same.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, a new ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR resonance for $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!D}$ appears near $\\delta \\approx 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ due to the deuteron’s different gyromagnetic ratio, while the IR spectrum is unchanged.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. A ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR experiment is specifically tuned to the resonance frequency of protons. It cannot and does not detect deuterons. A separate ${}^{2}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR experiment would be required. Furthermore, the IR spectrum is not unchanged; the isotopic substitution causes a large, predictable frequency shift.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, the IR carbonyl band near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1710\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ shifts by the same factor as the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch would, confirming isotopic substitution at oxygen, even if ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR shows no change.**\nThis option contradicts the problem statement, which explicitly states that a \"carbonyl-like band is absent\". It also posits that the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR shows no change, which is contrary to the provided data. Finally, the isotopic substitution at the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ site has a negligible vibrational coupling to a remote carbonyl group ($\\mathrm{C\\!=\\!O}$), so its frequency would not shift significantly, let alone by the same large factor as the $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$ stretch.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. After $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ addition, the vicinal methine multiplet next to oxygen collapses in the ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR due to loss of scalar coupling to $\\mathrm{O\\!-\\!H}$, even though the IR spectrum shows no new band near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; this collapse alone confirms an exchangeable proton.**\nThis option contradicts the provided data on two counts. First, it assumes the IR spectrum shows no new band, whereas the problem states a new band appears near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2550\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Second, it describes a collapse of a multiplet. However, the initial data states that the methine at $\\delta \\approx 3.7\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ \"shows no resolved scalar coupling to the broad singlet\". If there is no resolved coupling to begin with (a common situation due to rapid proton exchange), there is no multiplet to collapse.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3705261"}, {"introduction": "While $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ exchange confirms the presence of a labile proton, it doesn't always distinguish between an O-H and an N-H group.

Free, non-H-bonded O-H groups give a very sharp signal at $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3600-3650~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Carboxylic acid O-H stretches are exceptionally broad, spanning $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2500-3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   **N–H bonds**: Stretches for amines and amides appear in the $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3300-3500~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. A key feature is that they are significantly sharper than H-bonded O-H stretches because hydrogen bonding involving N-H is generally weaker (due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen). A secondary amine ($\\mathrm{R_2NH}$) or a secondary amide ($\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}NH{-}R'}$) will show a single N-H stretch. A primary amine or amide ($\\mathrm{R{-}NH_2}$ or $\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}NH_2}$) will show two bands (symmetric and asymmetric stretches).\n    -   **Terminal Alkyne C–H bonds**: These show a strong, sharp stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. However, the NMR data will help distinguish this from N-H/O-H.\n    -   The observed band is described as \"single, moderately sharp\" with a FWHM $\\approx 35~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This characteristic lineshape strongly argues against a typical H-bonded alcohol or phenol, and is highly characteristic of an N–H stretch. The presence of a single band indicates a secondary amine or amide.\n\n2.  **The Band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$**: This strong absorption is in the double bond region ($\\tilde{\\nu} = 1600-1850~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\n    -   This region is characteristic of carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C=O}$) and alkene ($\\mathrm{C=C}$) stretches.\n    -   Saturated ketones, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids absorb at higher frequencies ($\\tilde{\\nu} > 1700~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). The problem explicitly states there are no bands near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1710-1750~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, ruling out these functional groups as well as saturated esters.\n    -   Amide carbonyls ($\\mathrm{C=O}$ stretch, known as the Amide I band) absorb strongly in the $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1630-1680~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. The frequency is lowered relative to ketones due to resonance delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair, which imparts single-bond character to the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ bond and reduces its force constant $k$.\n    -   The observed strong band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is a perfect match for an amide carbonyl group.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of IR Data**: The combination of a moderately sharp N-H-like stretch at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3308~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a strong Amide I band at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ provides compelling evidence for a secondary amide functional group.\n\n**Analysis of ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum**\n\n1.  **The Signal at $\\delta = 7.60$**: This signal for one proton is in the downfield region. Its disappearance upon addition of D${}_{2}$O confirms it is an exchangeable or \"labile\" proton, such as one from an O-H, N-H, or S-H group. The chemical shift of $\\delta = 7.60$ is typical for an amide N-H proton ($\\delta \\approx 5-9$).\n\n2.  **The Signal at $\\delta = 4.10$**: This resonance is a methine proton ($\\mathrm{-CH-}$) coupled to another proton. The chemical shift suggests it is attached to a carbon that is adjacent to an electronegative atom (like N or O).\n\n3.  **The D${}_{2}$O Exchange Experiment**: The key observation is the simultaneous disappearance of the $\\delta = 7.60$ signal and the collapse of the $\\delta = 4.10$ doublet to a singlet. This definitively proves that the proton at $\\delta = 7.60$ (the labile proton) was scalar-coupled to the methine proton at $\\delta = 4.10$. The coupling constant is ${}^{3}J_{\\mathrm{H-N-C-H}} = 5.5~\\mathrm{Hz}$ (assuming an amide). Upon exchange, the N-H proton is replaced by a deuterium atom (${}^2\\mathrm{H}$). Since the standard ${}^1\\mathrm{H}$ NMR experiment does not detect ${}^2\\mathrm{H}$, the coupling interaction is removed, and the methine proton's signal simplifies to a singlet. This confirms the presence of an $\\mathrm{R-XH-CH-R'}$ fragment, where $\\mathrm{XH}$ is the labile proton group.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**\nThe IR data strongly suggest a secondary amide. The NMR data independently confirm the presence of a labile N-H proton that is three bonds away from a methine proton. The combination of all data points unambiguously to the presence of a secondary amide functional group with the substructure $\\mathrm{-C(=O)-NH-CH-}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. A secondary amide ($\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}NH{-}R}$): one N–H stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3200$–$3400~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and an amide $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ band near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1630$–$1680~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the N–H proton couples to a neighboring methine and disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange.**\n-   IR: The single, moderately sharp N-H stretch at $\\tilde{\\nu}=3308~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and the strong amide I band at $\\tilde{\\nu}=1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ are perfectly consistent with this description.\n-   NMR: The labile proton signal at $\\delta=7.60$ is characteristic of an amide N-H. The observed coupling to an adjacent methine group ($\\delta=4.10$) and the decoupling upon D${}_2$O exchange provides definitive confirmation of the $\\mathrm{-C(=O)-NH-CH-}$ substructure.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**. All provided data are fully and precisely explained by this assignment.\n\n**B. A phenol ($\\mathrm{Ar{-}OH}$) hydrogen-bonded to a conjugated carbonyl (enone), giving an O–H stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a conjugated $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the O–H proton disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange and may couple to a neighboring methine.**\n-   The IR band shape is the primary inconsistency. A hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch is characteristically broad, not \"moderately sharp\" with a FWHM of $\\approx 35~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. While the NMR data could superficially fit, the IR evidence strongly disfavors an O-H group. The problem's hint to \"avoid mislabeling\" this as an O-H stretch reinforces this conclusion.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A carboxylic acid ($\\mathrm{R{-}C(=O){-}OH}$) forming dimers, with a very broad O–H band spanning $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 2500$–$3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1700$–$1720~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the O–H disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange and could induce downfield shifts.**\n-   This is inconsistent with the IR spectrum on two counts: the O-H stretch is described as \"moderately sharp\", not extremely broad, and the carbonyl frequency for a dimer is in a region ($\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1700-1725~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) that was explicitly stated to be empty. The NMR shift for a carboxylic proton is also typically much further downfield ($\\delta = 10-13$).\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A secondary amine ($\\mathrm{R{-}NH{-}R}$) lacking a carbonyl, showing one N–H stretch near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 3300$–$3500~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the N–H disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange and can couple to adjacent methine.**\n-   While the N-H stretch and NMR data are consistent with a secondary amine, this option fails to explain the strong IR absorption at $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1655~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. A simple amine lacks a carbonyl group or any other group that would typically give rise to such a strong band in this region. Option A explains all features; this one does not.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. An alcohol ($\\mathrm{R{-}OH}$) intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded to a ketone, with an O–H stretch shifted to $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 3300~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a ketone $\\mathrm{C{=}O}$ near $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1715~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$; the O–H disappears upon D${}_{2}$O exchange and may couple to a neighboring methine under dry conditions.**\n-   This option is explicitly contradicted by the problem statement, which says \"No bands are observed near $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1710$–$1750~\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\". The ketone C=O band is expected in this region. Furthermore, as with option B, an H-bonded O-H group would produce a much broader IR band than observed.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3705235"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying labile protons, combined spectroscopy provides deep insights into the electronic structure and symmetry of molecules.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The provided spectroscopic data are characteristic for the compound classes in question, and the query asks for an explanation based on established principles of nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopy.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part explanation derived from first principles:\n1.  The origin of the chemical shift ($\\delta$) for an acetylenic proton ($\\mathrm{sp}$-hybridized $\\text{C-H}$) in ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR.\n2.  The origin of the frequency and intensity of the $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ stretching vibration in IR spectroscopy for terminal versus internal alkynes.\n\n**1. Acetylenic Proton Chemical Shift in ${}^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ NMR**\n\nThe chemical shift of a proton is determined by the local magnetic field it experiences, which is the sum of the external applied magnetic field, $B_0$, and the induced magnetic field, $B_{ind}$, generated by the surrounding electrons. $B_{local} = B_0 - B_{ind}$. A positive $B_{ind}$ (opposing $B_0$) is a shielding effect (upfield shift, lower $\\delta$), while a negative $B_{ind}$ (reinforcing $B_0$) is a deshielding effect (downfield shift, higher $\\delta$).\n\nTwo primary factors influence the chemical shift of an acetylenic proton:\n\na) **Hybridization and Electronegativity:** The carbon atom of the acetylenic $\\text{C-H}$ group is $\\mathrm{sp}$-hybridized. An $\\mathrm{sp}$ orbital has $50\\%$ $s$-character, compared to $33\\%$ for an $\\mathrm{sp}^2$ orbital (vinylic or aromatic) and $25\\%$ for an $\\mathrm{sp}^3$ orbital (alkylic). Orbitals with higher $s$-character are held more closely to the nucleus, making the atom more electronegative. Consequently, an $\\mathrm{sp}$-hybridized carbon is more electronegative than an $\\mathrm{sp}^2$ or $\\mathrm{sp}^3$ carbon. This increased electronegativity withdraws electron density from the hydrogen atom, reducing its local electron shielding. This effect, considered in isolation, would cause a significant *deshielding* of the proton, leading to a large downfield shift (high $\\delta$ value), presumably greater than that of vinylic protons ($\\delta \\approx 4.5-6.5$).\n\nb) **Magnetic Anisotropy of the $\\pi$ System:** An alkyne possesses two $\\pi$ bonds, forming a cylindrical region of high electron density around the $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ bond axis. When the molecule is placed in the external magnetic field, $B_0$, these $\\pi$ electrons are induced to circulate. For molecules that tumble rapidly in solution, we consider the time-averaged effect. When the linear axis of the alkyne is oriented perpendicular to $B_0$, the $\\pi$ electrons circulate around the bond axis. According to Lenz's law, this circulation generates an induced magnetic field, $B_{ind}$. The geometry of this induced field is crucial: it opposes the external field ($B_0$) along the alkyne axis but reinforces it in the regions perpendicular to the axis. The acetylenic proton is located directly on this axis. Therefore, it lies in a cone of *shielding*.\n\nThe observed chemical shift of $\\delta \\approx 2-3$ ppm is the net result of these two opposing effects. The strong diamagnetic shielding from the anisotropic circulation of the $\\pi$ electrons more than compensates for the deshielding effect arising from the high electronegativity of the $\\mathrm{sp}$-hybridized carbon. This explains why acetylenic protons are found significantly upfield (at lower $\\delta$) compared to vinylic protons, despite the higher $s$-character of the carbon to which they are attached.\n\n**2. $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ Stretch in IR Spectroscopy**\n\na) **Vibrational Frequency:** The frequency of a bond stretch can be approximated using the Hooke's law model for a diatomic harmonic oscillator. The vibrational wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is given by:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is the wavenumber (in $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$), $c$ is the speed of light, $k$ is the bond force constant, and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two atoms, $\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$.\nA carbon-carbon triple bond ($\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$) is significantly stronger and stiffer than a double bond ($\\text{C=C}$) or a single bond ($\\text{C-C}$). This corresponds to a much larger force constant, $k$. The reduced mass for a $\\text{}^{12}\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{}^{12}\\text{C}$ system is $\\mu = \\frac{12 \\times 12}{12 + 12} = 6$ atomic mass units, which is identical to the reduced mass of a $\\text{}^{12}\\text{C} = \\text{}^{12}\\text{C}$ system. Therefore, the dominant factor responsible for the high stretching frequency of the $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ bond (typically $2100-2260$ cm⁻¹) compared to a $\\text{C=C}$ bond ($1620-1680$ cm⁻¹) is its large force constant, $k$. The problem's value of $2108$ cm⁻¹ is within the expected range for a terminal alkyne ($2100-2140$ cm⁻¹).\n\nb) **Vibrational Intensity:** The intensity of an IR absorption band is proportional to the square of the change in the molecular dipole moment with respect to the change in the normal coordinate during the vibration, $(\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dq})^2$. A vibration is IR-active only if it produces an oscillating dipole moment.\n-   **Terminal Alkynes (R-C≡C-H):** The molecule is asymmetric. The $\\text{C}_{\\text{sp}}\\text{-H}$ bond is polarized, and the molecule has a net dipole moment. During the $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ stretching vibration, the bond lengths change, altering the overall distribution of charge and thus causing a significant change in the molecular dipole moment ($\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dq} \\neq 0$). This results in an IR absorption of medium intensity. The sharp $\\text{C-H}$ stretch near $3300$ cm$^{-1}$ also has a large change in dipole moment and is a characteristic strong, sharp peak for terminal alkynes.\n-   **Internal Alkynes (R-C≡C-R'):**\n    -   If the alkyne is **symmetrically substituted** (e.g., $R = R'$), the molecule has a center of symmetry and a zero net dipole moment. The $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ stretch is a symmetric vibration that does not break this symmetry. Consequently, there is **no change** in the dipole moment during the vibration ($\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dq} = 0$). This vibration is therefore **IR-inactive**.\n    -   If the alkyne is **asymmetrically substituted** ($R \\neq R'$), there is a small permanent dipole moment. The stretching vibration will induce a very small change in this dipole moment. The resulting IR absorption will be very weak.\nThis principle explains why internal alkynes show a very weak or entirely absent $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ absorption in their IR spectra, as described in the problem.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The $\\mathrm{sp}$ $\\text{C-H}$ proton is positioned along the axis of the $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ bond and experiences shielding due to the diamagnetic anisotropy of the linear $\\pi$ system, which overcompensates the deshielding tendency of increased $s$-character, yielding an upfield resonance near $2$-$3$~$\\mathrm{ppm}$. The $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ stretching frequency near $2100$-$2140$~$\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ arises from the large bond force constant combined with the reduced mass of the stretching pair, and terminal alkynes generate a substantial change in dipole moment during the stretch. Internal alkynes are frequently weak in IR because symmetric substitution minimizes the change in dipole moment, reducing the transition moment and thus the band intensity.**\nThis option correctly identifies all the key principles. It correctly explains the NMR chemical shift as a balance between anisotropy (shielding) and hybridization (deshielding), with anisotropy being dominant. It correctly attributes the IR frequency to the large force constant. It correctly attributes the IR intensity difference between terminal and internal alkynes to the change in dipole moment during the vibration. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The $\\mathrm{sp}$ $\\text{C-H}$ proton resonates near $2$-$3$~$\\mathrm{ppm}$ solely because the $\\mathrm{sp}$ carbon’s higher electronegativity strongly deshields the proton. The $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ IR intensity is governed by changes in polarizability, and internal alkynes are weak because their polarizability changes are small; the wavenumber near $2100$~$\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is mainly due to a larger reduced mass for triple bonds compared to double bonds.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, strong deshielding from electronegativity would cause a downfield shift (large $\\delta$), the opposite of what is observed relative to vinylic protons. It completely ignores magnetic anisotropy. Second, IR intensity is governed by changes in dipole moment, not polarizability; change in polarizability is the selection rule for Raman spectroscopy. Third, the reduced mass of $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ is not larger than that of $\\text{C=C}$; the higher frequency is due to the force constant. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The $\\mathrm{sp}$ $\\text{C-H}$ proton lies in a deshielding region analogous to aromatic ring currents, pushing it downfield; conjugation in internal alkynes enhances IR activity, so terminal alkynes should be weaker. The $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ stretching frequency is determined predominantly by resonance interactions that lower the force constant.**\nThis option is incorrect. The acetylenic proton is in a shielding region, not a deshielding region. The analogy to aromatic protons, which are in an external, deshielding region, is flawed. The claim that terminal alkynes should be weaker in IR than conjugated internal alkynes is contrary to general observations and ignores the primary role of molecular symmetry. While resonance does lower the force constant, the primary reason the frequency is high in the first place is the intrinsic strength of the triple bond, not resonance effects. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The $\\mathrm{sp}$ $\\text{C-H}$ proton resonates near $2$-$3$~$\\mathrm{ppm}$ because hydrogen bonding to common solvents shields it, and the $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ IR feature at $2100$-$2140$~$\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ arises from overtone coupling (Fermi resonance); internal alkynes are weak in IR because their vibrational modes are localized and do not couple effectively to radiation.**\nThis option is incorrect. Hydrogen bonding to the weakly acidic acetylenic proton would cause deshielding (a downfield shift), not shielding. The chemical shift is an intrinsic property, not primarily a solvent effect. The $\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$ stretch is a fundamental vibration, not an overtone or a result of Fermi resonance. The reason for weak IR activity in internal alkynes is the small or zero change in dipole moment, not a vague concept of \"localization\". **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3705254"}]}
