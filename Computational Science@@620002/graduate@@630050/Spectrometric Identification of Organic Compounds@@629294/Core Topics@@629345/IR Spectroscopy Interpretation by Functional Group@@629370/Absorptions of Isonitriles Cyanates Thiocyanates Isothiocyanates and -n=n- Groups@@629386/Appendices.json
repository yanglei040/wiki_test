Build your reasoning from the harmonic oscillator model for vibrational frequencies and the infrared selection rule.\n\nWhich of the following reasoning pathways most robustly justifies the assignment of the $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ band to an isonitrile?\n\nA. Begin with the harmonic oscillator relation $\\,\\tilde{\\nu}=\\dfrac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{k/\\mu}\\,$, where $\\,\\tilde{\\nu}\\,$ is the wavenumber, $\\,k\\,$ the force constant, $\\,\\mu\\,$ the reduced mass, and $\\,c\\,$ the speed of light. Because a nitrile and an isonitrile both involve a C–N pair in the stretching coordinate, $\\,\\mu\\,$ is similar; thus the observed shift from the nitrile region (near $2260$–$2230\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) down to $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ indicates a smaller effective $\\,k\\,$, consistent with the known lower stretching frequency of $\\,\\mathrm{N{\\equiv}C}\\,$ in isonitriles due to electronic structure and coupling.

The harmonic oscillator model, expressed as $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{k/\\mu}$, is the foundational approximation for molecular vibrations. The IR selection rule, which relates absorption intensity to the change in dipole moment during vibration, is also a fundamental principle. The specified frequency ranges for the various functional groups are standard and accepted in the field of organic spectroscopy. The task of identifying a functional group from a combination of positive and negative IR spectral evidence is a classic and valid application of this technique.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a key spectral feature and a set of constraints (absence of other bands) that are sufficient to logically eliminate confounding possibilities and converge on the most probable structure. The question is unambiguous.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms common to chemistry (e.g., \"very intense\", \"sharp absorption\", specific wavenumber ranges). It is free from subjective or non-scientific claims.\n4.  **Flaw Checklist**: The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, well-posed, and non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The analysis can proceed.\n\n## DERIVATION OF SOLUTION\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify the functional group responsible for a very intense, sharp IR absorption at $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, using the provided spectral data and first principles.\n\n**First Principles:**\n1.  **Vibrational Frequency (Harmonic Oscillator Model)**: The vibrational frequency of a bond, expressed as a wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is given by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{k/\\mu}$. Here, $c$ is the speed of light, $k$ is the bond force constant (a measure of stiffness), and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the vibrating atoms. A higher force constant (e.g., triple bond vs. double bond) or a lower reduced mass (lighter atoms) leads to a higher vibrational frequency.\n2.  **Infrared Selection Rule**: A vibration is IR-active if it causes a change in the net dipole moment of the molecule. The intensity of the absorption is proportional to the square of the rate of change of the dipole moment with respect to the displacement along the normal coordinate, $(\\partial\\boldsymbol{p}/\\partial q)^2$. Therefore, vibrations of highly polar bonds typically result in intense IR absorptions.\n\n**Analysis of the Main Absorption at $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$:**\nThis frequency falls within the region characteristic of triple bonds ($\\mathrm{C{\\equiv}C}$, $\\mathrm{C{\\equiv}N}$) and cumulenes ($\\mathrm{X{=}Y{=}Z}$). We will evaluate each candidate functional group.\n\n1.  **Nitrile ($\\mathrm{R\\text{–}C{\\equiv}N}$)**: The $\\mathrm{C{\\equiv}N}$ stretching vibration in nitriles typically occurs in the range of $2260$–$2220\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The problem explicitly states there is **no absorption** in the $2260$–$2230\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ window. Therefore, a nitrile is definitively ruled out.\n\n2.  **Isonitrile ($\\mathrm{R\\text{–}N{\\equiv}C}$)**: The stretching vibration for the isonitrile group occurs at a lower frequency than for nitriles, typically in the range of $2180$–$2120\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The observed band at $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is perfectly consistent with this assignment. The lower frequency compared to a nitrile, despite having a similar reduced mass for the core C-N unit, is due to a lower effective force constant, $k$. This arises from the electronic structure of the isonitrile group, which has significant contribution from a resonance form $\\mathrm{R\\text{–}N{=}C:}$, giving the bond character less than a full triple bond. Furthermore, the $\\mathrm{R\\text{–}N{\\equiv}C}$ group is highly polar, with a formal positive charge on nitrogen and a negative charge on carbon ($R\\text{–}\\overset{+}{N}{\\equiv}\\overset{-}{C}}$). This leads to a large change in dipole moment during the stretch, resulting in a **very intense** absorption, as observed. Isonitrile is a strong candidate.\n\n3.  **Cyanate ($\\mathrm{R\\text{–}O\\text{–}C{\\equiv}N}$)**: The $\\mathrm{C{\\equiv}N}$ stretch in cyanates is similar to that in nitriles, appearing around $2270$–$2240\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. This is inconsistent with the observed band at $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Additionally, cyanates possess a $\\mathrm{C-O}$ single bond adjacent to the nitrile. This asymmetric $\\mathrm{O-(C \\equiv N)}$ stretch would give rise to a strong absorption, typically in the $1250$–$1150\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ region. The problem states there are **no unusually strong bands in the $1250$–$1200\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range**, providing strong evidence against a cyanate.\n\n4.  **Thiocyanate ($\\mathrm{R\\text{–}S\\text{–}C{\\equiv}N}$)**: The $\\mathrm{C{\\equiv}N}$ stretch in thiocyanates occurs in the range of $2175$–$2140\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. While this range is closer to the observed frequency than that of nitriles, $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is on the very low end for a thiocyanate but is a typical value for an isonitrile. More diagnostically, a thiocyanate contains a $\\mathrm{C-S}$ bond. The $\\mathrm{C-S}$ stretch typically appears in the $800$–$600\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ fingerprint region. The problem notes the absence of **conspicuous absorptions in the $800$–$700\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ window**. While $\\mathrm{C-S}$ stretches can be weak, this negative evidence, combined with the frequency mismatch, disfavors the thiocyanate assignment.\n\n5.  **Isothiocyanate ($\\mathrm{R\\text{–}N{=}C{=}S}$)**: This is a cumulene system. It exhibits a very strong and often broad asymmetric stretching vibration ($\\nu_{as}$) in the $2140$–$2000\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. The band at $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is consistent with this. However, isothiocyanates have other characteristic features. Because the $\\mathrm{N{=}C{=}S}$ moiety is linear but not centrosymmetric, its symmetric stretch ($\\nu_s$) is IR-active, although weaker, around $1350$–$1000\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Crucially, when attached to an aromatic ring, strong bands due to coupling often appear in the $1500$–$1400\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ region. The problem states that the spectrum **lacks any prominent bands in the $1500$–$1400\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ region**. This piece of negative evidence argues strongly against an isothiocyanate.\n\n6.  **Azo Group ($\\mathrm{R\\text{–}N{=}N\\text{–}R'}$)**: The $\\mathrm{N{=}N}$ double bond stretch occurs in the $1630$–$1575\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range (for trans isomers). The frequency is completely inconsistent with the observed $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Also, if the group is symmetric (R=R'), the stretch is IR-inactive. Even when active, it is typically weak. An azo group is definitively ruled out.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of a very intense, sharp band at $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ combined with the systematic exclusion of all other possibilities based on the provided negative evidence (absence of bands in key diagnostic regions) makes the isonitrile ($\\mathrm{R\\text{–}N{\\equiv}C}$) the only consistent assignment.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A.** This option presents a comprehensive and correct line of reasoning. It starts with the harmonic oscillator model to explain the frequency difference between nitriles and isonitriles, correctly attributing it to a difference in force constant ($k$). It correctly applies the IR selection rule to explain the high intensity. It then systematically and correctly uses the provided negative spectral data to exclude cyanates (no strong $\\mathrm{C-O}$ stretch), thiocyanates (no strong $\\mathrm{C-S}$ feature), isothiocyanates (no prominent bands at $1500$–$1400\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$), and azo groups (wrong frequency region). The final conclusion that the compound is an isonitrile is robustly supported by this step-by-step logic.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This option claims that any sharp band between $2300$ and $2000\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ indicates a nitrile and that additional bands are secondary. This is factually incorrect. This region contains many functional groups. Dismissing the exact frequency and the absence of other bands is poor spectroscopic practice and leads to an erroneous conclusion, especially as it ignores the data that explicitly rules out a nitrile ($2260$–$2230\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This option correctly notes that isothiocyanates can absorb near $2125\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. However, it makes a critical error by claiming the $\\mathrm{N{=}C{=}S}$ system is symmetric and thus other vibrations are IR-inactive. The $\\mathrm{N{=}C{=}S}$ group is composed of three different atoms and is therefore inherently asymmetric (it has no center of symmetry). Its symmetric stretch is IR-active. The assertion that other features are not expected is false and ignores the key negative evidence provided in the problem statement that is used to rule out this very possibility.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This option misapplies the harmonic oscillator model. It incorrectly argues that attaching a heavier atom (like sulfur in a thiocyanate) *always* lowers the frequency via the reduced mass term $\\mu$. The vibrational frequency of a functional group is a complex function of both electronic effects (which alter $k$) and mechanical coupling, not just the mass of a distal atom. The primary component of $\\mu$ for the $\\mathrm{C{\\equiv}N}$ stretch involves carbon and nitrogen. Furthermore, dismissing the diagnostic value of other spectral regions is a flaw in reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E.** This option proposes that the band is a combination band of an azo group. Combination and overtone bands are almost always orders of magnitude weaker than fundamental vibrations. It is physically implausible for a combination band to be the \"single, very intense\" feature in a spectrum, as described. The fundamental $\\mathrm{N{=}N}$ stretch is not in the correct region. This explanation is speculative and contradicts fundamental principles of IR spectroscopy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3691749"}, {"introduction": "Real-world spectra often contain weak features like overtones and combination bands that can be mistaken for fundamental vibrations, leading to incorrect structural assignments.

Avoid isotopic and companion-band tests and do not analyze solvent dependence.", "solution": "The user has requested a an analysis of a spectroscopic problem. The first step is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   Analyte: An aromatic acyl compound.\n-   Infrared (IR) Data:\n    -   A weak, reproducible band near $2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    -   A strong carbonyl fundamental ($\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$) at $1682\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n    -   An aromatic ring breathing mode at $424\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n-   Hypothesis to test: The band at $2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is a carbonyl-related combination band, not a genuine fundamental from a thiocyanate ($\\mathrm{SCN}$) or isothiocyanate ($\\mathrm{NCS}$) group.\n-   Required Rationale: Must start from the harmonic oscillator model, dependence of frequency on force constants ($k$) and reduced mass ($\\mu$), and incorporate anharmonicity, overtones, combination bands, and Fermi resonance.\n-   Required Diagnostic Plan: Must include at least one quantitative isotopic substitution prediction.\n-   Available Tools: Selective isotopic labeling ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ at carbonyl, aromatic ring deuteration, $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$), analysis of companion bands, and solvent-dependent shifts.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on the principles of vibrational (IR) spectroscopy. The concepts of fundamental vibrations, overtones, combination bands, isotopic shifts, and characteristic group frequencies are all central to this field. The provided wavenumbers are physically realistic. A carbonyl for an aromatic ketone is typically found in the $1680-1700\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ range. The $2100-2200\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region is where various triple bonds and cumulenes absorb, but it is also a well-known region for weak overtones and combination bands related to carbonyls. The hypothesis that the weak band is a combination band is immediately suggested by the numerical relationship $1682\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} + 424\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This is a classic diagnostic challenge in spectral interpretation.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of data and a specific, answerable question: to devise a rigorous plan to distinguish between two plausible hypotheses. A definite and optimal strategy can be formulated based on established spectroscopic methods.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language devoid of subjectivity. The request for a \"rigorous diagnostic plan\" calls for an objective evaluation of experimental strategies.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, presenting a realistic and non-trivial challenge in spectrometric analysis. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**Fundamental Principles**\n\nThe vibrational motion of a chemical bond can be approximated by the simple harmonic oscillator model. For a diatomic system, the vibrational frequency, expressed as a wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is given by:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light, $k$ is the bond force constant (a measure of bond stiffness), and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two atoms ($\\mu = m_1 m_2 / (m_1 + m_2)$). This model predicts that for a given normal mode of vibration, only the fundamental transition ($\\Delta v = 1$) is allowed in IR spectroscopy, provided it induces a change in the molecular dipole moment.\n\nHowever, real molecular potential energy surfaces are anharmonic. This anharmonicity has several important consequences:\n1.  **Overtones and Combination Bands:** The strict selection rule ($\\Delta v = 1$) is relaxed, allowing for the observation of transitions with $\\Delta v > 1$ (overtones, e.g., $2\\tilde{\\nu}_i$) and transitions involving the simultaneous excitation of multiple modes (combination bands, e.g., $\\tilde{\\nu}_i + \\tilde{\\nu}_j$, or difference bands, e.g., $\\tilde{\\nu}_i - \\tilde{\\nu}_j$). These bands are typically much weaker in intensity than fundamental transitions.\n2.  **Fermi Resonance:** If an overtone or combination band has a frequency and symmetry that is very close to a fundamental vibration, the two states can mix. This phenomenon, known as Fermi resonance, results in two observed bands that are shifted from their unperturbed positions and, critically, a redistribution of intensity. The weaker overtone/combination band \"borrows\" intensity from the stronger fundamental, making it more prominent than it would otherwise be.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation**\n\nThe problem provides three key spectral features: $\\tilde{\\nu}_1 = 1682\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (strong, $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ stretch), $\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = 424\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (aromatic ring mode), and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{obs} = 2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ (weak). The sum of the first two fundamentals is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_1 + \\tilde{\\nu}_2 = 1682\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} + 424\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nThis exact correspondence strongly suggests that the observed weak band at $2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is a sum combination band, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{comb}$, arising from the simultaneous excitation of the carbonyl stretch and the ring breathing mode. Its weak intensity is consistent with the nature of combination bands.\n\n**Diagnostic Plan to Confirm the Hypothesis**\n\nA rigorous plan must provide unambiguous evidence for the combination band assignment and rule out the alternatives, namely a thiocyanate ($\\mathrm{Ar-S-C\\equiv N}$) or isothiocyanate ($\\mathrm{Ar-N=C=S}$) group.\n\n1.  **Isotopic Substitution:** This is the most powerful tool for assigning vibrations.\n    -   **Test on the Combination Band Hypothesis:** If $\\tilde{\\nu}_{comb} = \\tilde{\\nu}(\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}) + \\tilde{\\nu}(\\mathrm{ring})$, then changing the mass of atoms involved in either fundamental must shift $\\tilde{\\nu}_{comb}$ accordingly.\n        -   **Carbonyl $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Labeling:** Replacing $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ with $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ in the carbonyl group increases the reduced mass $\\mu_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$. The predicted frequency shift of the carbonyl fundamental is:\n          $$ \\tilde{\\nu}'_{\\mathrm{C=O}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{^{12}\\mathrm{C}=^{16}\\mathrm{O}}}{\\mu_{^{13}\\mathrm{C}=^{16}\\mathrm{O}}}} = 1682\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\sqrt{\\frac{12 \\cdot 16 / (12+16)}{13 \\cdot 16 / (13+16)}} \\approx 1682\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\times 0.978 \\approx 1645\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\n          This is a downshift of $\\approx 37\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Consequently, the combination band should also shift by approximately the same amount: $\\tilde{\\nu}'_{comb} \\approx 1645\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} + 424\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 2069\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Observing this large, correlated shift would be very strong evidence.\n        -   **Aromatic Ring Deuteration:** Replacing hydrogens on the aromatic ring with deuterium would significantly increase the mass of the ring system, lowering the frequency of the ring breathing mode ($\\tilde{\\nu}(\\mathrm{ring})$). This would, in turn, cause a downshift in the $2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band. The carbonyl frequency would be largely unaffected.\n    -   **Test on the SCN/NCS Hypothesis:** A genuine $\\tilde{\\nu}(\\mathrm{C\\equiv N})$ or $\\tilde{\\nu}_{as}(\\mathrm{NCS})$ fundamental is electronically and mechanically localized to that functional group. It would be almost entirely insensitive to isotopic substitution at the distant carbonyl carbon or on the aromatic ring. Therefore, if these isotopic substitutions are performed and the $2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band does not shift (or shifts negligibly), the combination band hypothesis is disproven.\n\n2.  **Companion Bands and Intensity:**\n    -   **Isothiocyanates ($\\mathrm{NCS}$)** are characterized by a very strong and often broad asymmetric stretch in the $2040-2140\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region. The observed band is explicitly described as \"weak,\" which is inconsistent with an isothiocyanate fundamental.\n    -   **Thiocyanates ($\\mathrm{SCN}$)** show a strong, sharp $C\\equiv N$ stretch near $2130-2175\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and a C-S stretch near $700-760\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The observed band's weakness and slightly low frequency argue against this assignment. The absence of a C-S stretch would provide further negative evidence.\n\n3.  **Solvent Effects:** The carbonyl group is polar and a hydrogen bond acceptor. Changing from a nonpolar solvent (e.g., hexane) to a polar, protic solvent (e.g., methanol) will cause hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl oxygen, weakening the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ bond and lowering its stretching frequency. If the $2106\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band is a combination band involving the carbonyl, its frequency should track the solvent-induced shifts of the $1682\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ carbonyl fundamental. The solvent dependence of a thiocyanate or isothiocyanate stretch, while present, would likely be different in magnitude.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **Option A:** This option proposes a comprehensive and rigorous plan. It correctly identifies the combination band hypothesis ($1682 + 424\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$). It proposes two different, powerful isotopic substitution experiments ($^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ on carbonyl, ring deuteration) and correctly predicts their outcomes for both the combination band and the alternative SCN/NCS cases. The quantitative estimate of the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ shift and its effect on the combination band is correct. It correctly includes the necessary search for companion bands to rule out SCN/NCS and adds a solvent dependence study as a final corroborative test. This plan is exemplary in its scientific rigor and thoroughness. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Option B:** This option is flawed. It arbitrarily assigns the band to an isonitrile ($\\mathrm{N}\\equiv\\mathrm{C}$), an alternative not suggested by the problem's context, while ignoring the compelling numerical evidence for a combination band. Its proposed chemical test (acid addition) is poorly conceived; a strong acid would affect the carbonyl group as well, and the predicted downshift for a protonated isonitrile is questionable (an upshift is more likely). Explicitly rejecting isotopic tests, the most definitive method available, makes this plan fundamentally weak. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option C:** This option suffers from confirmation bias. It prematurely assigns the band as a thiocyanate stretch, ignoring the \"weak\" intensity and the obvious $1682+424$ sum. While it proposes an isotopic test ($^{34}\\mathrm{S}$), its prediction of a \"$>20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\" shift is a significant overestimation; the actual shift would be much smaller, especially for a thiocyanate. Its greatest flaw is the explicit instruction to \"ignore carbonyl combination possibilities,\" which is unscientific. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option D:** This option is based on a fundamentally incorrect premise of spectroscopy. It asserts that a $\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N}$ stretch is Raman-inactive. In reality, due to the large change in polarizability, the $\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{N}$ stretch is one of the most characteristically *strong* and reliable bands in Raman spectroscopy. Therefore, its entire logical structure (\"the presence of a Raman band...proves a carbonyl combination band\") is invalid. Relying solely on this flawed logic while avoiding all other robust tests (isotopes, companion bands) makes this the least rigorous plan. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a scientifically sound, comprehensive, and rigorous diagnostic plan that correctly applies the principles of vibrational spectroscopy to solve the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3691726"}]}
