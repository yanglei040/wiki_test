Treat each N–H bond as a local diatomic harmonic oscillator embedded in the polyatomic cation, and assume that isotopic substitution of hydrogen by deuterium does not change the local force constant of the N–X stretch or the local environment to first order. Starting from the diatomic harmonic oscillator expression for the fundamental vibrational wavenumber in terms of the force constant and the reduced mass, derive the mass-scaling relation for the stretching wavenumber upon isotopic substitution.

The problem statement provides all necessary data: the initial N–H stretching wavenumber ($\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–H}} = 3200\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$), the relevant isotopic masses ($m(^{14}\\mathrm{N})$, $m(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$, $m(^{2}\\mathrm{H})$), and the model to be used (diatomic harmonic oscillator with a constant force constant upon substitution). The problem is a standard textbook exercise in physical chemistry/spectroscopy and is entirely valid.\n\nThe fundamental vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, of a diatomic harmonic oscillator is given by the expression:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the system. The wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is related to the frequency by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Thus, the wavenumber can be expressed as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nApplying this model to the N–H and N–D bonds treated as local diatomic oscillators, we can write their respective wavenumbers:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–H}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{N–H}}}{\\mu_{\\text{N–H}}}} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–D}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{N–D}}}{\\mu_{\\text{N–D}}}} $$\nThe problem states that the force constant, $k$, does not change upon isotopic substitution. This is a key part of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the potential energy surface is independent of the nuclear masses. Therefore, we assume $k_{\\text{N–H}} = k_{\\text{N–D}} = k$.\n\nTo derive the mass-scaling relation, we take the ratio of the N–D wavenumber to the N–H wavenumber:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–D}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{N–H}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\text{N–D}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\text{N–H}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\text{N–H}}}{\\mu_{\\text{N–D}}}} $$\nThis is the desired mass-scaling relation.

Because the zero-point-energy of the N–D bond is lower than that of the N–H bond, the N–D bond vibration samples a more harmonic region of the true potential energy surface. Since anharmonicity generally lowers the observed fundamental frequency relative to the harmonic prediction, this effect is more pronounced for the N–H oscillator than for the N–D oscillator, meaning the simple scaling calculation (which uses the anharmonically-lowered N–H frequency) will underestimate the true N–D wavenumber.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2338}$$", "id": "3708801"}, {"introduction": "Beyond structural identification, infrared spectroscopy is a potent quantitative tool.

Integrating over the absorption band from wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_1$ to $\\tilde{\\nu}_2$ gives:\n$$ S = \\int_{\\tilde{\\nu}_1}^{\\tilde{\\nu}_2} A(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,d\\tilde{\\nu} = \\int_{\\tilde{\\nu}_1}^{\\tilde{\\nu}_2} \\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,b\\,c\\,d\\tilde{\\nu} $$\nSince the path length $b$ and concentration $c$ are constant with respect to wavenumber, they can be taken out of the integral:\n$$ S = b\\,c \\left( \\int_{\\tilde{\\nu}_1}^{\\tilde{\\nu}_2} \\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,d\\tilde{\\nu} \\right) $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the definition of the molar integrated absorption coefficient, $E$.\n$$ E = \\int_{\\tilde{\\nu}_1}^{\\tilde{\\nu}_2} \\varepsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,d\\tilde{\\nu} $$\nThus, the governing equation is:\n$$ S = E \\cdot b \\cdot c $$\nThis equation shows that a plot of the integrated absorbance $S$ versus concentration $c$ should be linear, passing through the origin (since for $c=0$, $S=0$). The slope of this line, $m$, is given by:\n$$ m = \\frac{S}{c} = E \\cdot b $$\nFrom this, the molar integrated absorption coefficient $E$ can be calculated as:\n$$ E = \\frac{m}{b} $$\nTo find the slope $m$, we perform a linear least-squares regression on the provided standard data of $S$ versus $c$.\nThe data points $(c, S)$ are:\n$(0.0100, 0.303)$, $(0.0200, 0.598)$, $(0.0300, 0.904)$, $(0.0400, 1.196)$.\nLet $x_i = c_i$ and $y_i = S_i$.

The functional groups mentioned (ammonium, carboxylate) and potential contaminants (water, carbon dioxide) have well-established and characteristic IR absorption frequencies. The sample preparation method (KBr pellet) and its known issues (hygroscopicity) are standard knowledge in analytical chemistry. The entire premise is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a set of spectral data and asks for an evaluation of statements concerning potential artifacts and control experiments. This requires applying knowledge of IR spectroscopy to assess the validity of each statement. A unique set of correct statements can be determined.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language. The data are quantitative (wavenumbers) and the conditions are described factually. There is no subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, with no identifiable flaws. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nFirst, we analyze the provided spectral data in the context of the suspected compound, an ammonium carboxylate salt, and common laboratory artifacts.\n\nAn ammonium carboxylate salt, such as $\\mathrm{RCOO^-NH_4^+}$ or $\\mathrm{RCOO^-R'NH_3^+}$, would be expected to show the following characteristic infrared absorptions:\n1.  **$\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ Stretching:** Ammonium ions ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$) and primary amine salts ($\\mathrm{R'NH_3^+}$) exhibit strong, very broad stretching absorptions due to hydrogen bonding. For $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$, this typically appears from $3000–3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. For $\\mathrm{R'NH_3^+}$, it is often a complex, broad band in the $2800–3200$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range. The observed very broad envelope from $3100$ to $3500$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ partially overlaps with this region.\n2.  **Carboxylate ($\\mathrm{COO^-}$) Stretching:** The carboxylate anion has two characteristic stretches: a strong asymmetric stretch ($\\nu_{as}$) typically between $1550$ and $1610$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and a symmetric stretch ($\\nu_{s}$) between $1300$ and $1420$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The observed strong bands at $1550$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $1408$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ are in excellent agreement with these assignments, strongly supporting the presence of a carboxylate group.\n3.  **$\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ Bending:** Ammonium ion ($\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$) has a bending mode near $1400-1430$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which would be obscured by the strong carboxylate symmetric stretch at $1408$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Primary amine salts ($\\mathrm{R'NH_3^+}$) have an asymmetric bend near $1600$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a symmetric bend near $1500$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\nThe critical ambiguity arises from the fact that water ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$), a ubiquitous contaminant, has absorptions that can mimic or obscure the desired signals:\n-   **$\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ Stretching:** A very broad band from $3200$–$3600$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ due to hydrogen-bonded water molecules. This strongly overlaps with the $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ stretching region.\n-   **$\\mathrm{H\\!–\\!O\\!–\\!H}$ Bending:** A medium-intensity band from $1630$–$1650$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The observed band at $1635$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is a classic indicator of water contamination, especially when using hygroscopic $\\mathrm{KBr}$ pellets in a humid environment.\n\nThe task is to evaluate proposed methods for distinguishing authentic ammonium signals from artifacts or other confounding spectral features.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Hygroscopic water absorbed into the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet can mimic ammonium $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ features via a broad $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ stretching envelope spanning $3200$–$3600$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and a $\\mathrm{H\\!–\\!O\\!–\\!H}$ bending band near $1630$–$1650$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Controls: dry $\\mathrm{KBr}$ at elevated temperature under vacuum, prepare pellets in a desiccator, record a fresh background immediately before sample insertion, and repeat acquisition using Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) to avoid $\\mathrm{KBr}$-related water contributions. Disappearance of these features under dry conditions indicates an artifact.**\n\nThis statement accurately identifies water as a major interferent in KBr pellet spectroscopy. Potassium bromide is highly hygroscopic and readily absorbs atmospheric moisture. The spectral regions cited for the water $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ stretch and $\\mathrm{H\\!–\\!O\\!–\\!H}$ bend are correct and correspond well with the bands observed in the problem at $3100–3500$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $1635$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Each proposed control is a standard and scientifically sound laboratory practice to mitigate or eliminate water contamination:\n1.  Drying $\\mathrm{KBr}$ in an oven under vacuum removes pre-existing water.\n2.  Preparing pellets in a dry atmosphere (desiccator or glove box) prevents moisture re-adsorption.\n3.  Recording a fresh background corrects for water vapor in the instrument's beam path at the time of measurement.\n4.  Switching to ATR spectroscopy avoids the hygroscopic $\\mathrm{KBr}$ matrix altogether and is less sensitive to atmospheric water.\nThe conclusion that the disappearance of these bands under controlled conditions confirms them as artifacts is logically correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Carbon dioxide $\\left(\\mathrm{CO_2}\\right)$ contamination from ambient air is a frequent cause of apparent ammonium $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ stretching near $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Control: purge the spectrometer with dry nitrogen to remove $\\mathrm{CO_2}$; disappearance of the $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ band confirms the artifact.**\n\nThis statement is scientifically unsound. Atmospheric carbon dioxide ($\\mathrm{CO_2}$) is a linear, non-polar molecule with two principal IR-active absorptions. The strong asymmetric stretch ($\\nu_3$) appears as a sharp, characteristic doublet centered at approximately $2349$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The bending mode ($\\nu_2$) appears near $667$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ has no vibrational modes that absorb near $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Therefore, it cannot be mistaken for or mimic an ammonium $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ stretch. While purging the spectrometer is the correct control for removing atmospheric $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ (and water vapor), the premise of the statement is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Strongly hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ stretching produces a very broad band typically between $2500$–$3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which can overlap the ammonium $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ region. Controls: neutralize the acid with a stoichiometric base to convert it to carboxylate, verifying loss of the broad acid $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ band and the appearance or strengthening of carboxylate asymmetric and symmetric stretches near $1550$–$1610$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $1400$–$1420$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, respectively; additionally, the acid $\\mathrm{C\\!=\\!O}$ near $1710$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ should diminish or disappear after neutralization.**\n\nThis statement addresses a potential misassignment. If the sample were not a pure salt but a mixture of a free carboxylic acid ($\\mathrm{RCOOH}$) and an amine ($\\mathrm{R'NH_2}$), the spectrum would be different. A carboxylic acid dimer exhibits a very broad $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ stretch from $2500$–$3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, which indeed overlaps the $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ stretching region of an ammonium salt. Such a scenario could lead to a misinterpretation of the broad absorption. The proposed control—neutralization with a base—is a valid chemical test. This reaction, $\\mathrm{RCOOH} + \\mathrm{OH^-} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{RCOO^-} + \\mathrm{H_2O}$, would cause the disappearance of the acid's characteristic broad $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ stretch and the carbonyl ($\\mathrm{C\\!=\\!O}$) stretch (typically $1700–1725$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for dimers), and the appearance (or strengthening) of the carboxylate anion stretches ($\\nu_{as}$ and $\\nu_{s}$). This set of controls provides a definitive method to distinguish between a pre-formed salt and a mixture containing a free carboxylic acid, thus preventing a misassignment.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Isotopic exchange with deuterium oxide $\\left(\\mathrm{D_2O}\\right)$ can distinguish ammonium $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$ from other contributors by shifting $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ stretches to $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!D}$ near approximately $2400$–$2500$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Controls: expose the sample to $\\mathrm{D_2O}$ vapor and monitor whether the broad band near $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ shifts downward as expected for $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!D}$; concurrent shifts of water $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ to $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!D}$ near $\\sim 2500$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and changes in the $1630$–$1650$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ bending band can be used to separate water artifacts from genuine ammonium signals.**\n\nThis statement describes a powerful and classic technique for identifying labile protons ($\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$, $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$). The vibrational frequency $\\nu$ is approximately proportional to $1/\\sqrt{\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass. Replacing hydrogen ($m_H \\approx 1$) with deuterium ($m_D \\approx 2$) roughly doubles the reduced mass, shifting the stretching frequency down by a factor of approximately $1/\\sqrt{2}$. An $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ stretch at $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ would shift to $\\approx 3300/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2333$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The range $2400–2500$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ is a correct estimation for the resulting $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!D}$ stretch. This experiment would affect all labile protons. Any bands due to $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ *and* any bands due to contaminating $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ would shift. An $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ stretch also shifts to an $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!D}$ stretch near $2500$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, and the $\\mathrm{H\\!–\\!O\\!–\\!H}$ bend at $1635$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ would diminish and be replaced by a $\\mathrm{D\\!–\\!O\\!–\\!D}$ bend near $1210$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. By carefully observing which bands disappear and which new bands appear, one can reliably identify the origin of the absorptions. This control method is scientifically rigorous and directly addresses the problem's ambiguity.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Hydrocarbon grease on optics frequently produces strong bands near $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ that mimic ammonium $\\mathrm{N\\!-\\!H}$. Control: clean optical components thoroughly; disappearance of the $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ band confirms the artifact.**\n\nThis statement is scientifically unsound. Common laboratory hydrocarbon greases are composed of saturated alkanes. The main IR absorptions of alkanes are $\\mathrm{C\\!–\\!H}$ stretching vibrations, which occur in the $2850–2960$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ range, i.e., below $3000$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. To have a band near $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, a compound must typically possess an $\\equiv\\mathrm{C\\!–\\!H}$ (terminal alkyne) or some types of $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ or $\\mathrm{O\\!–\\!H}$ bonds. Hydrocarbon greases do not contain these functional groups. Therefore, hydrocarbon grease contamination cannot produce a band at $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ that mimics an ammonium $\\mathrm{N\\!–\\!H}$ stretch. While cleaning optics is good practice, it would not affect a band at $3300$ $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ unless the contaminant was something other than typical hydrocarbon grease.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatements A, C, and D correctly identify potential sources of misassignment (water artifact, carboxylic acid confounder) or propose valid control experiments (H/D exchange) to confirm the identity of the ammonium group. Statements B and E are based on factually incorrect spectral assignments for $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and hydrocarbon grease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3708829"}]}
