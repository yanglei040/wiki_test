To accommodate this geometric constraint, the carbonyl carbon atom rehybridizes. It allocates more p-character to the strained C-C single bonds within the ring. By conservation of orbital character, this necessarily increases the s-character of the orbitals forming the C=O bond.

The resonance effect, where a lone pair from chlorine donates into the $\\pi^*$ orbital of the C=O group, is weak for chlorine (and other heavier halogens) due to poor orbital overlap between the carbon $2p$ and chlorine $3p$ orbitals.

A value of $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1805\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ is plausible for both. A robust method must probe a property other than the $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ value itself or must induce a predictable change that differentiates the two possible causes.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Decide by a simple threshold: if $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}} \\gt 1780\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, assign to ring strain; if $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}} \\lt 1780\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, assign to acyl halide. No corroborating bands or chemical tests are required.**\n\nThis method proposes an arbitrary frequency threshold. Standard IR correlation tables show that the vibrational frequencies for these two classes of compounds overlap significantly. For instance, cyclobutanone absorbs at $\\approx 1785\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, and more highly strained bicyclic systems can absorb well above $1800\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. Acyl chlorides typically absorb in the $1785$–$1815\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ range. A value of $1805\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ falls comfortably within the expected range for both possibilities. Using a simple, fixed threshold like $1780\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ is empirically unsound and lacks a theoretical basis for discriminating in the region of overlap. It is not a defensible or robust scientific method.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Require convergent evidence tied to $k$ versus $\\mu$: (i) search for a $\\nu_{\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{X}}$ band characteristic of an acyl halide (e.g., $\\nu_{\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Cl}}$ in the $700$–$800\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ region or $\\nu_{\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{F}}$ in the $1000$–$1400\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ region) alongside the high $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$; and (ii) perform a derivatization that removes the halide while preserving ring geometry, such as converting $\\mathrm{COX}$ to an ester or amide. A large downshift of $\\approx 70$–$100\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ in $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ following derivatization indicates the original high frequency was due to the acyl halide’s strong inductive effect on $k$, whereas persistence of a high $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ indicates ring strain (unchanged $k$ from the strained framework).**\n\nThis option proposes a multi-faceted approach combining spectroscopic and chemical evidence. This is the hallmark of rigorous structure elucidation.\n(i) **Spectroscopic Evidence:** The acyl chloride structure ($\\mathrm{R-CO-Cl}$) contains a C-Cl bond, whereas the strained ketone does not. A C-Cl stretch ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{C-Cl}}$) is expected to appear in the IR spectrum, typically in the $700-800\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ range for acyl chlorides. The presence of such a band provides strong corroborating evidence for the acyl chloride. Its absence, while less definitive as C-Cl stretches can be weak, would argue against it.\n(ii) **Chemical Evidence:** Acyl chlorides are highly reactive functional groups that can be easily derivatized. For example, reaction with an alcohol ($\\mathrm{R'OH}$) converts an acyl chloride to an ester ($\\mathrm{R-CO-OR'}$). A strained bicyclic ketone would be unreactive under the mild conditions used for this conversion. This difference in chemical reactivity is a powerful discriminator. Furthermore, the spectroscopic consequence of this derivatization is predictable. Replacing the strongly electron-withdrawing -Cl substituent with a less withdrawing and more resonance-donating -OR' substituent causes a large decrease in the force constant $k$. This results in a significant downshift in $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$. For example, from $\\approx 1805\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ for the acyl chloride to $\\approx 1735\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ for the corresponding ester, a downshift of $\\approx 70\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. If the compound were the unreactive ketone, the starting material would be recovered unchanged, and the spectrum would show the persistent high-frequency absorption. This combination of looking for a unique structural feature (C-Cl bond) and exploiting unique chemical reactivity provides a robust and scientifically defensible method.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Use oxygen isotope substitution: prepare the $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$-labeled carbonyl and measure the isotope shift. If the $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ downshift upon $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ substitution exceeds $40\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, assign to acyl halide; if less than $40\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, assign to ring strain.**\n\nThis method proposes to distinguish the two structures by changing the reduced mass $\\mu$. According to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, isotopic substitution does not change the potential energy surface, and therefore the force constant $k$ remains the same. The frequency shift depends only on the change in $\\mu$. The ratio of the frequencies for the $^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ and $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ isotopologues is given by $\\tilde{\\nu}_{18}/\\tilde{\\nu}_{16} = \\sqrt{\\mu_{16}/\\mu_{18}}$.\nFor a pure C=O diatomic oscillator, using atomic masses $m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) \\approx 12$ amu, $m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) \\approx 16$ amu, and $m(^{18}\\mathrm{O}) \\approx 18$ amu, we calculate $\\mu_{16} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 16}{12+16} \\approx 6.86$ amu and $\\mu_{18} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 18}{12+18} \\approx 7.20$ amu.\nThe expected frequency ratio is $\\sqrt{6.86/7.20} \\approx 0.976$.\nFor an initial frequency of $\\tilde{\\nu}_{16} = 1805\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, the new frequency would be $\\tilde{\\nu}_{18} \\approx 0.976 \\times 1805\\ \\text{cm}^{-1} \\approx 1761\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. The predicted downshift is $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 1805 - 1761 = 44\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$.\nThis calculation is for an idealized, purely localized C=O stretch. In reality, the C=O stretch can couple with other vibrations in the molecule, which would make the observed shift smaller than the theoretical maximum. However, the C=O stretch is generally a very highly localized vibration due to its high frequency and the large masses of the atoms involved relative to attached hydrogens. There is no sound theoretical reason to presuppose that the degree of vibrational coupling would be systematically and significantly different for a strained ketone versus an acyl chloride. Both are expected to show a large isotopic shift, close to the theoretical value. Therefore, using a threshold like $40\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ is arbitrary and unlikely to be a reliable discriminator. This experiment confirms the band is a C=O stretch but does not help distinguish the cause of its high frequency.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Decide by IR band intensity of the $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ alone: the stronger the band, the larger the change in dipole moment on stretching, which is greater for acyl halides; thus classify a very intense $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{C=O}}$ as acyl halide and a merely strong one as ring strain.**\n\nThis method relies on IR band intensity. Intensity is proportional to the square of the change in the dipole moment with respect to the normal coordinate, $(\\partial\\vec{p}/\\partial Q)^2$. While it is plausible that the inductive effect of the chlorine in an acyl halide leads to a larger change in dipole moment upon stretching compared to a ketone, relying on a qualitative judgment of intensity (\"very intense\" versus \"merely strong\") is not a robust method. The measured intensity of a band depends on many factors, including concentration, path length, and instrument parameters, making absolute or even relative intensity comparisons between different samples unreliable without careful standardization. Carbonyl stretches in ketones are already classified as \"strong\" to \"very strong\". Differentiating between \"strong\" and \"very strong\" is subjective and not a basis for a defensible assignment of structure.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3726128"}]}
