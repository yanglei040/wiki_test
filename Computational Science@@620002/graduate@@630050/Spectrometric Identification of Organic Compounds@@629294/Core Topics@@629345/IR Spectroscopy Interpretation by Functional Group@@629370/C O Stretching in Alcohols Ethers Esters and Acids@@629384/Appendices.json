The potential energy distribution (PED) for a given normal mode $k$ can be quantified by attributing the mode’s potential energy $V_k = \\tfrac{1}{2} a^2 \\mathbf{e}_k^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k$ (for any real scalar amplitude $a$) to internal coordinates via equal partitioning of off-diagonal terms, yielding the fractional contribution for coordinate $i$,\n$$\n\\mathrm{PED}_i^{(k)} = \\frac{e_{k,i}^2 F_{ii} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} e_{k,i} e_{k,j} F_{ij}}{\\mathbf{e}_k^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k}.\n$$\nThis problem asks you to compute, for each test case provided below, the normal modes, identify the two modes that correspond predominantly to the $\\text{C=O}$ stretch ($s_1$) and the acyl $\\text{C–O}$ stretch ($s_2$), and compute their wavenumbers and PEDs.\n\nFundamental base to be used: small-amplitude vibrations in molecules under the harmonic approximation, Newtonian mechanics for conservative systems with quadratic potentials, and standard properties of symmetric positive-definite generalized eigenproblems.\n\nYour program must perform the following steps for each test case:\n- Solve $\\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k = \\lambda_k \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e}_k$ for eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ and $\\mathbf{G}$-orthonormal eigenvectors $\\mathbf{e}_k$.\n- Compute wavenumbers $\\nu_k = \\sqrt{\\lambda_k}$ in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n- Identify the $\\text{C=O}$ stretch band as the mode index $k$ that maximizes $e_{k,1}^2$ over all modes, and the acyl $\\text{C–O}$ stretch band as the distinct mode index (not equal to the first) that maximizes $e_{k,2}^2$ among the remaining modes.\n- Compute $\\mathrm{PED}_i^{(k)}$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ using the formula above, which allocates off-diagonal coupling energy equally to the interacting coordinates.\n\nExpress all wavenumbers in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, rounded to one decimal place, and express each PED entry as a decimal rounded to four decimal places. The final output for each test case must be a list of two items, one for the $\\text{C=O}$-dominant mode and one for the acyl $\\text{C–O}$-dominant mode. Each item must itself be a list $[\\nu, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]$, where $\\nu$ is the wavenumber in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $p_i$ is the PED entry for coordinate $i$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test case $1$ (moderate, physically plausible couplings; $\\mathbf{G}$ identity):\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3027600 & 125280 & 36888 & 23490 \\\\\n125280 & 1440000 & 38160 & 27000 \\\\\n36888 & 38160 & 1123600 & 19080 \\\\\n23490 & 27000 & 19080 & 810000\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{G}^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n- Test case $2$ (diagonal $\\mathbf{F}$, no coupling; $\\mathbf{G}$ identity):\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3027600 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1440000 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1123600 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 810000\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{G}^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n- Test case $3$ (near-degenerate $\\text{C=O}$ and $\\text{C–O}_{\\text{acyl}}$ with stronger coupling; $\\mathbf{G}$ identity):\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{(3)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2890000 & 428400 & 27030 & 15300 \\\\\n428400 & 2822400 & 35616 & 22680 \\\\\n27030 & 35616 & 1123600 & 19080 \\\\\n15300 & 22680 & 19080 & 810000\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{G}^{(3)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n- Test case $4$ (moderate couplings with non-identity $\\mathbf{G}$ reflecting different effective masses):\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{(4)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3027600 & 125280 & 36888 & 23490 \\\\\n125280 & 1440000 & 38160 & 27000 \\\\\n36888 & 38160 & 1123600 & 19080 \\\\\n23490 & 27000 & 19080 & 810000\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{G}^{(4)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1.0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1.2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0.9 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1.1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each element corresponds to one test case and is a list of two lists, one for the $\\text{C=O}$-dominant mode and one for the acyl $\\text{C–O}$-dominant mode. For example, an output element per test case must look like $[[\\nu,p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4],[\\nu,p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4]]$, with all numeric entries adhering to the rounding and unit specifications above. The entire output must aggregate the four test cases as $[ \\text{case1}, \\text{case2}, \\text{case3}, \\text{case4} ]$ on a single line, without any extra text.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard computational task in vibrational spectroscopy, specifically the analysis of molecular vibrations within the harmonic approximation using Wilson's FG matrix method. All necessary data, including force constant matrices ($\\mathbf{F}$), kinetic energy matrices ($\\mathbf{G}$), and a clear procedure for analysis, are provided. The definitions, though using a slightly non-standard convention for the kinetic energy matrix $\\mathbf{G}$, are self-consistent and lead to a well-defined generalized eigenproblem. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem explores the vibrations of a simplified four-coordinate model of an ester functional group. The dynamics of this system, in the harmonic approximation, are described by the Lagrangian $L = T - V$. The potential energy $V$ and kinetic energy $T$ are given as quadratic forms of the internal coordinates $\\mathbf{s}$ and their time derivatives $\\dot{\\mathbf{s}}$, respectively:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{s}$$\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2} \\dot{\\mathbf{s}}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{G} \\dot{\\mathbf{s}}$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{F}$ is the force constant matrix, whose elements $F_{ij}$ represent the second derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the internal coordinates. $\\mathbf{G}$ is a matrix related to the effective masses of the atoms involved in the vibrations. Applying the Euler-Lagrange equations, $\\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{s}}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{s}} = 0$, yields the equations of motion:\n$$\\mathbf{G} \\ddot{\\mathbf{s}} + \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{s} = 0$$\nWe seek oscillatory solutions of the form $\\mathbf{s}(t) = \\mathbf{e} \\cos(\\omega t)$, where $\\mathbf{e}$ is a time-independent vector representing the displacement amplitudes of the internal coordinates and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. Substituting this into the equation of motion gives:\n$$-\\omega^2 \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e} \\cos(\\omega t) + \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e} \\cos(\\omega t) = 0$$\nThis must hold for all times $t$, which leads to the generalized eigenvalue problem:\n$$\\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e} = \\omega^2 \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e}$$\nThis is the central equation to be solved. The eigenvalues, which we denote $\\lambda_k = \\omega_k^2$, correspond to the squared vibrational frequencies, and the eigenvectors $\\mathbf{e}_k$ describe the form of the normal modes in the basis of internal coordinates $\\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\\}$. The problem defines the relationship between the eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ (in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and the wavenumbers $\\nu_k$ (in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) as $\\nu_k = \\sqrt{\\lambda_k}$.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Solve the Generalized Eigenproblem**: Given the matrices $\\mathbf{F}$ and $\\mathbf{G}$, we solve $\\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k = \\lambda_k \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e}_k$ for the set of eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_k\\}$ and the corresponding eigenvectors $\\{\\mathbf{e}_k\\}$. Standard numerical linear algebra libraries provide functions to solve this, yielding eigenvalues and a matrix of corresponding column eigenvectors that are $\\mathbf{G}$-orthonormal, satisfying $\\mathbf{e}_j^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e}_k = \\delta_{jk}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Wavenumbers**: For each eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$, the associated wavenumber is calculated as $\\nu_k = \\sqrt{\\lambda_k}$.\n\n3.  **Identify Characteristic Modes**: The normal modes are mixtures of the basis internal coordinates. We identify the mode corresponding predominantly to a specific internal coordinate stretch by finding the normal mode vector $\\mathbf{e}_k$ in which the component for that coordinate is maximized. Specifically:\n    -   The $\\text{C=O}$ stretch-dominant mode ($s_1$) is the mode $k_{CO}$ that maximizes the squared component $e_{k,1}^2$ over all modes $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    -   The acyl $\\text{C–O}$ stretch-dominant mode ($s_2$) is the mode $k_{acyl}$ (where $k_{acyl} \\neq k_{CO}$) that maximizes $e_{k,2}^2$ over the remaining modes.\n\n4.  **Compute Potential Energy Distribution (PED)**: The PED quantifies the contribution of each internal coordinate to the potential energy of a given normal mode. The problem provides the formula for the fractional contribution of coordinate $i$ to mode $k$:\n    $$\\mathrm{PED}_i^{(k)} = \\frac{e_{k,i}^2 F_{ii} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} e_{k,i} e_{k,j} F_{ij}}{\\mathbf{e}_k^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k}$$\n    This formula adheres to the principle of equally partitioning the interaction energy term $e_{k,i} e_{k,j} F_{ij} + e_{k,j} e_{k,i} F_{ji}$ between coordinates $i$ and $j$. The denominator, representing the total potential energy of the mode (up to a constant), simplifies significantly. From the eigenproblem, $\\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k = \\lambda_k \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e}_k$. Left-multiplying by $\\mathbf{e}_k^{\\mathsf{T}}$ gives $\\mathbf{e}_k^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k = \\lambda_k \\mathbf{e}_k^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e}_k$. Since the eigenvectors are $\\mathbf{G}$-orthonormal, $\\mathbf{e}_k^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{G} \\mathbf{e}_k = 1$, and thus the denominator is simply the eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$. The numerator for coordinate $i$ can be efficiently computed as the $i$-th element of the vector resulting from the element-wise product of $\\mathbf{e}_k$ and the vector $\\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k$. So, if we define a vector $\\mathbf{N}^{(k)}$ whose elements are the numerators, $\\mathbf{N}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{e}_k \\odot (\\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{e}_k)$, where $\\odot$ is the Hadamard (element-wise) product. The PED vector for mode $k$ is then $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_k} \\mathbf{N}^{(k)}$.\n\n5.  **Format Output**: For each test case, the wavenumbers (rounded to one decimal place) and the four PED components (rounded to four decimal places) are collected for the two identified modes ($\\text{C=O}$ and acyl $\\text{C–O}$) and formatted into the specified list structure.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import eigh\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the vibrational problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test case 1\n        {\n            \"F\": np.array([\n                [3027600, 125280, 36888, 23490],\n                [125280, 1440000, 38160, 27000],\n                [36888, 38160, 1123600, 19080],\n                [23490, 27000, 19080, 810000]\n            ]),\n            \"G\": np.identity(4)\n        },\n        # Test case 2\n        {\n            \"F\": np.array([\n                [3027600, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 1440000, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 1123600, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 810000]\n            ]),\n            \"G\": np.identity(4)\n        },\n        # Test case 3\n        {\n            \"F\": np.array([\n                [2890000, 428400, 27030, 15300],\n                [428400, 2822400, 35616, 22680],\n                [27030, 35616, 1123600, 19080],\n                [15300, 22680, 19080, 810000]\n            ]),\n            \"G\": np.identity(4)\n        },\n        # Test case 4\n        {\n            \"F\": np.array([\n                [3027600, 125280, 36888, 23490],\n                [125280, 1440000, 38160, 27000],\n                [36888, 38160, 1123600, 19080],\n                [23490, 27000, 19080, 810000]\n            ]),\n            \"G\": np.array([\n                [1.0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 1.2, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0.9, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 1.1]\n            ])\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        F_matrix = case[\"F\"]\n        G_matrix = case[\"G\"]\n        \n        # Step 1: Solve the generalized eigenproblem F*e = lambda*G*e\n        # eigh returns eigenvalues in ascending order and corresponding eigenvectors as columns.\n        # The eigenvectors are G-orthonormalized: e.T @ G @ e = I\n        lambdas, e_vecs = eigh(F_matrix, G_matrix)\n        \n        # Step 2: Calculate wavenumbers\n        wavenumbers = np.sqrt(lambdas)\n        \n        # Step 3: Identify characteristic modes\n        # e_vecs[i, :] gives the i-th component for all modes.\n        s1_contributions = e_vecs[0, :]**2\n        k_co_stretch = np.argmax(s1_contributions)\n        \n        s2_contributions = e_vecs[1, :]**2\n        # Temporarily remove the already-found mode to find the max of the remainder\n        s2_contributions_masked = np.copy(s2_contributions)\n        s2_contributions_masked[k_co_stretch] = -1.0 # Exclude from argmax\n        k_acyl_co_stretch = np.argmax(s2_contributions_masked)\n        \n        modes_to_analyze = [k_co_stretch, k_acyl_co_stretch]\n        case_results = []\n        \n        for k in modes_to_analyze:\n            lambda_k = lambdas[k]\n            e_k = e_vecs[:, k]\n            nu_k = wavenumbers[k]\n            \n            # Step 4: Compute Potential Energy Distribution (PED)\n            # Numerator for coordinate i is sum_j(e_ki * e_kj * F_ij)\n            # This is equivalent to e_ki * (F_i_row @ e_k)\n            # A vectorized way to calculate all numerators is e_k * (F @ e_k)\n            numerators = e_k * (F_matrix @ e_k)\n            \n            # Denominator is e_k.T @ F @ e_k which is equal to lambda_k\n            ped_vector = numerators / lambda_k\n            \n            # Assemble the output for this mode\n            result_for_mode = [\n                round(nu_k, 1),\n                round(ped_vector[0], 4),\n                round(ped_vector[1], 4),\n                round(ped_vector[2], 4),\n                round(ped_vector[3], 4)\n            ]\n            case_results.append(result_for_mode)\n            \n        all_results.append(case_results)\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The format is a string representation of a list of lists.\n    # Example: [[[v,p1,p2,p3,p4],[v,p1,p2,p3,p4]], [[v,...],[v,...]]]\n    print(str(all_results).replace(\" \", \"\"))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3694734"}]}
