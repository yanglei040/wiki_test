Express your final result as a dimensionless decimal fraction, and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not include a percent sign in your answer.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the relationship between infrared (IR) absorption wavenumbers for carbon-carbon double bond stretches and the effect of conjugation. The analysis is to be based on the harmonic oscillator model.\n\nFirst, let us establish the fundamental principles. In the harmonic oscillator approximation, the vibrational frequency $\\nu$ of a diatomic system is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond, representing its stiffness, and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two atoms involved in the vibration.\n\nIn IR spectroscopy, it is conventional to use wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$, which is defined as the reciprocal of the wavelength $\\lambda$. The wavenumber is related to the frequency $\\nu$ by the speed of light, $c$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{c}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu$ from the harmonic oscillator model into the definition of $\\tilde{\\nu}$ gives the relationship between the observed wavenumber and the physical properties of the bond:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the absorption wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is directly proportional to the square root of the force constant $k$, assuming the reduced mass $\\mu$ and the speed of light $c$ are constant.\n\nNext, we must justify which alkene is more conjugated. Conjugation refers to the delocalization of $\\pi$-electrons in a system of alternating single and multiple bonds. This delocalization has a significant effect on bond strength. An isolated carbon-carbon double bond ($C=C$) has its $\\pi$-electron density localized between the two carbon atoms. In a conjugated system, this $\\pi$-electron density is spread over several atoms. This delocalization lowers the total energy of the molecule, making it more stable. Crucially, it also alters the character of the bonds. The nominal double bond acquires some single-bond character, making it weaker and slightly longer than an isolated double bond. Conversely, the nominal single bond acquires some double-bond character.\n\nThe force constant $k$ is a measure of bond strength. A stronger bond is stiffer and has a higher force constant. Since conjugation weakens the $C=C$ bond, it reduces the bond's force constant. According to the relationship $\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\sqrt{k}$, a lower force constant $k$ will result in a lower vibrational wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n\nWe are given two wavenumbers: $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1620\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1680\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. Since $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}} < \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, alkene $A$, which has the lower stretching frequency, must have the weaker $C=C$ bond. Therefore, alkene $A$ is the more conjugated alkene, and alkene $B$ is the less conjugated (or unconjugated) reference.\n\nNow, we derive the relationship between the ratio of wavenumbers and the ratio of force constants. Let $k_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ be the force constants for the $C=C$ bonds in alkenes $A$ and $B$, respectively. The problem states that the reduced mass $\\mu$ is the same for both. We can write the expressions for their wavenumbers as:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\mu}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mu}}\n$$\nTaking the ratio of these two equations, the constant term $\\frac{1}{2\\pi c\\sqrt{\\mu}}$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{A}}/\\mu}}{\\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{B}}/\\mu}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives the desired relationship between the ratio of force constants and the ratio of wavenumbers:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the fractional decrease in the force constant of the more conjugated alkene ($A$) relative to the less conjugated alkene ($B$). The reference for this fractional change is the force constant of the less conjugated alkene, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$. The fractional decrease is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} - k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} = 1 - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{A}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived relationship into this expression:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right)^2\n$$\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1620\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1680\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1620}{1680}\\right)^2\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{1620}{1680} = \\frac{162}{168} = \\frac{81}{84} = \\frac{27}{28}\n$$\nSo, the calculation becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{27}{28}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{27^2}{28^2} = 1 - \\frac{729}{784}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} = \\frac{784 - 729}{784} = \\frac{55}{784}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional decrease} \\approx 0.070153061...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It presents a standard problem in molecular spectroscopy and group theory. All necessary information and definitions are provided to derive a solution from first principles. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution process involves three sequential steps as outlined in the problem: identifying the point group, determining the irreducible representation of the specified normal mode, and assessing its infrared and Raman activity.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Point Group**\nThe problem specifies the symmetry operations for the planar trans-2-butene molecule:\n1.  The identity operation, $E$.\n2.  A two-fold rotation by $180^{\\circ}$, $C_2$, about an axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and passing through the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. We define this as the $z$-axis.\n3.  Inversion, $i$, through the midpoint of the double bond, which we define as the origin $(0,0,0)$.\n4.  Reflection, $\\sigma_h$, in the molecular plane. With our choice of axes, this is the $xy$-plane.\n\nThe set of operations is $\\{E, C_2, i, \\sigma_h\\}$. To confirm they form a group, we must verify that the product of any two operations is also a member of the set. Let's consider the action of these operations on a general point $(x, y, z)$:\n- $E(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)$\n- $C_2(x, y, z) = (-x, -y, z)$\n- $i(x, y, z) = (-x, -y, -z)$\n- $\\sigma_h(x, y, z) = (x, y, -z)$\n\nNow we examine the products of operations:\n- $C_2 \\cdot i$ acting on $(x, y, z)$: $C_2(i(x, y, z)) = C_2(-x, -y, -z) = (x, y, -z)$, which is the same as the action of $\\sigma_h$. Thus, $C_2 \\cdot i = \\sigma_h$.\n- Since all operations commute (it is an Abelian group), we also have $i \\cdot C_2 = \\sigma_h$.\n- Similarly, $C_2 \\cdot \\sigma_h = i$ and $i \\cdot \\sigma_h = C_2$.\nAll products are within the set, and each operation is its own inverse ($C_2 \\cdot C_2 = E$, $i \\cdot i = E$, $\\sigma_h \\cdot \\sigma_h = E$). The set of operations $\\{E, C_2, i, \\sigma_h\\}$ forms a group of order $4$. This group is known as the $C_{2h}$ point group.\n\n**Step 2: Irreducible Representation of the Normal Coordinate $Q$**\nThe normal coordinate $Q$ is defined as the measure of the instantaneous change in the carbon-carbon double bond length. We need to determine how this coordinate transforms under each symmetry operation of the $C_{2h}$ group. The character of the representation for a given operation will be $+1$ if $Q$ is unchanged and $-1$ if $Q$ is inverted.\n\n- **Operation $E$**: The identity operation leaves the molecule and the bond stretch unchanged. $E(Q) = Q$. The character is $\\chi(E) = 1$.\n- **Operation $C_2$**: This rotation swaps the two carbon atoms of the double bond. However, the bond itself is mapped onto its original position, and a stretching motion (both atoms moving apart from the center) remains a stretching motion. The magnitude of the bond length change, $Q$, is therefore unchanged. $C_2(Q) = Q$. The character is $\\chi(C_2) = 1$.\n- **Operation $i$**: Inversion also swaps the two carbon atoms. Similar to the $C_2$ operation, the bond is mapped onto itself, and the stretching coordinate $Q$ is unaffected. $i(Q) = Q$. The character is $\\chi(i) = 1$.\n- **Operation $\\sigma_h$**: The molecular plane contains the C=C bond. Reflection in this plane leaves the atoms of the bond, and thus the stretching coordinate, completely unchanged. $\\sigma_h(Q) = Q$. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_h) = 1$.\n\nThe set of characters for the representation of $Q$, denoted $\\Gamma_Q$, is $(1, 1, 1, 1)$. To identify the corresponding irreducible representation, we refer to the character table for the $C_{2h}$ point group. The group being Abelian of order $4$, it has four one-dimensional irreducible representations. The representation with all characters equal to $+1$ is always the totally symmetric representation. In the $C_{2h}$ group, this is designated $A_g$.\nThe character table for $C_{2h}$ is:\n| $C_{2h}$ | $E$ | $C_2$ | $i$ | $\\sigma_h$ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| $A_g$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n| $B_g$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |\n| $A_u$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ |\n| $B_u$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $1$ |\nComparing the characters for $\\Gamma_Q$, $(1, 1, 1, 1)$, with the table, we conclude that the normal coordinate $Q$ transforms as the $A_g$ irreducible representation.\n\n**Step 3: Infrared and Raman Activity**\nA vibrational mode is infrared (IR) active if its irreducible representation is the same as that of one of the Cartesian coordinates ($x$, $y$, or $z$). A mode is Raman active if its irreducible representation matches that of one of the quadratic functions of Cartesian coordinates ($x^2$, $y^2$, $z^2$, $xy$, $xz$, or $yz$).\n\n**Infrared Activity:**\nWe determine the representations for $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n- **z-coordinate** (along the $C_2$ axis):\n  - $E(z) = z \\implies \\chi(E) = 1$\n  - $C_2(z) = z \\implies \\chi(C_2) = 1$\n  - $i(z) = -z \\implies \\chi(i) = -1$\n  - $\\sigma_h(z) = -z \\implies \\chi(\\sigma_h) = -1$\n  The characters $(1, 1, -1, -1)$ correspond to the $A_u$ representation.\n- **x- and y-coordinates** (in the $\\sigma_h$ plane):\n  - $E(x) = x, E(y) = y \\implies \\chi(E) = 1$\n  - $C_2(x) = -x, C_2(y) = -y \\implies \\chi(C_2) = -1$\n  - $i(x) = -x, i(y) = -y \\implies \\chi(i) = -1$\n  - $\\sigma_h(x) = x, \\sigma_h(y) = y \\implies \\chi(\\sigma_h) = 1$\n  The characters $(1, -1, -1, 1)$ correspond to the $B_u$ representation for both $x$ and $y$.\nThe IR-active representations are $A_u$ and $B_u$. The representation of the C=C stretch is $\\Gamma_Q = A_g$. Since $A_g$ does not match $A_u$ or $B_u$, the mode is **not infrared-active**.\n\n**Raman Activity:**\nWe determine the representations for the quadratic functions:\n- **$x^2, y^2, z^2, xy$**:\n  - For $x^2$: $C_2(x^2)=(-x)^2=x^2$, $i(x^2)=(-x)^2=x^2$, $\\sigma_h(x^2)=x^2=x^2$. All operations yield $+1$. The characters are $(1, 1, 1, 1)$, which is $A_g$.\n  - The same logic applies to $y^2$ and $z^2$.\n  - For $xy$: $C_2(xy)=(-x)(-y)=xy$, $i(xy)=(-x)(-y)=xy$, $\\sigma_h(xy)=xy$. The characters are $(1, 1, 1, 1)$, which is $A_g$.\n- **$xz, yz$**:\n  - For $xz$: $C_2(xz)=(-x)(z)=-xz$, $i(xz)=(-x)(-z)=xz$, $\\sigma_h(xz)=(x)(-z)=-xz$. The characters are $(1, -1, 1, -1)$, which is $B_g$.\n  - The same logic applies to $yz$.\nThe Raman-active representations are $A_g$ and $B_g$. The representation of the C=C stretch is $\\Gamma_Q = A_g$. Since $A_g$ matches the representation of the polarizability tensor components $\\alpha_{xx}$, $\\alpha_{yy}$, $\\alpha_{zz}$, and $\\alpha_{xy}$, the mode is **Raman-active**.\n\nThis result is consistent with the rule of mutual exclusion, which applies to molecules with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric), stating that vibrational modes cannot be both IR and Raman active. Our mode is an $A_g$ (gerade, symmetric with respect to inversion) mode, which is Raman-active and IR-inactive.\n\n**Final Answer Encoding:**\n- Let $I=1$ if IR-active, $0$ otherwise. Since the mode is not IR-active, $I=0$.\n- Let $R=1$ if Raman-active, $0$ otherwise. Since the mode is Raman-active, $R=1$.\n- Let $S$ be the code for the irreducible representation, with $A_g \\mapsto 0$.
