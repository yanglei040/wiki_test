It is scientifically grounded in the principles of vibrational spectroscopy and the harmonic oscillator model. The premises are self-contained and consistent, providing all necessary data and assumptions to derive a unique solution. The task is a standard, well-posed problem in physical chemistry.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. First, we derive the mass-scaling relation as requested, and then we use it to calculate the O-D stretching wavenumber.\n\nThe stretching vibration of a diatomic molecule, or a bond within a larger molecule treated as an isolated diatomic system, can be modeled using the harmonic oscillator approximation. The vibrational frequency, $\\nu$, is given by:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant of the bond and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the two-atom system.\n\nThe wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, which is the customarily reported unit in infrared spectroscopy, is related to the frequency by $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Therefore, the wavenumber is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\n\nFor the O-H and O-D stretching vibrations, we can write their respective wavenumbers as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OH}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{OH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OD}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{OD}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}} $$\nThe problem states that we should assume the bond force constant is unchanged upon isotopic substitution. This is a direct consequence of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which assumes that the electronic potential energy surface, and thus the curvature of the potential well at the equilibrium geometry (which determines the force constant), is independent of the nuclear masses. Therefore, we set $k_{\\mathrm{OH}} = k_{\\mathrm{OD}} = k$.\n\nTo find the relationship between the two wavenumbers, we take the ratio of their expressions:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OD}}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OH}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k/\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}}{\\sqrt{k/\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}{k}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}} $$\nThis gives the mass-scaling relation requested by the problem:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OD}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OH}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}} $$\n\nNext, we must calculate the reduced masses for the O-H and O-D systems. The reduced mass $\\mu$ for a system of two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, is defined as:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $$\nThe problem provides the following isotopic masses: $m_{\\mathrm{O}} = 15.999\\,\\mathrm{u}$, $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.007825\\,\\mathrm{u}$, and $m_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2.014102\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n\nThe reduced mass for the O-H oscillator is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}} m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{m_{\\mathrm{O}} + m_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{(15.999)(1.007825)}{15.999 + 1.007825}\\,\\mathrm{u} = \\frac{16.124192175}{17.006825}\\,\\mathrm{u} \\approx 0.9481045\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\nThe reduced mass for the O-D oscillator is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{O}} m_{\\mathrm{D}}}{m_{\\mathrm{O}} + m_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{(15.999)(2.014102)}{15.999 + 2.014102}\\,\\mathrm{u} = \\frac{32.223617898}{18.013102}\\,\\mathrm{u} \\approx 1.788899\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\nThe units of mass (unified atomic mass units, $\\mathrm{u}$) will cancel in the ratio, so we can use the numerical values directly.\n\nNow, we compute the square root of the ratio of the reduced masses:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.9481045}{1.788899}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.529944} \\approx 0.727973 $$\n\nFinally, we can estimate the position of the O-D stretching band using the given O-H band position, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OH}} = 3640\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OD}} = (3640\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OH}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{OD}}}} \\approx (3640\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times 0.727973 \\approx 2649.82\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{OD}} \\approx 2650\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nThis result is consistent with the general rule of thumb that O-D stretching frequencies are approximately $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the corresponding O-H frequencies, with the exact value depending on the precise masses involved.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2650}$$", "id": "3716186"}, {"introduction": "Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool not just for identifying molecules, but also for quantifying the strength of their interactions.
