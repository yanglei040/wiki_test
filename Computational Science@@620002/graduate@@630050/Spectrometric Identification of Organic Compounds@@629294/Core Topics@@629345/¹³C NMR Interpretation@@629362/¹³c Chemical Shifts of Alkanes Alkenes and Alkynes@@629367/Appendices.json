In empirically validated increment models of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR, the presence of a substituent in a defined positional relationship to a carbon (for example, the $\\alpha$-position, meaning directly bonded) produces an approximately additive change in the observed shift relative to an unsubstituted baseline environment for that carbon type. \n\nConsider $1$-chloropropane, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}$, and focus on the $\\alpha$ carbon, defined here as the methylene carbon directly bonded to $\\mathrm{Cl}$.

The fundamental principle of this model is that the chemical shift of a given carbon nucleus can be approximated by starting with a baseline value for its fundamental type (e.g., methylene, $‐\\text{CH}_2‐$) and then adding specific increments for each substituent attached to or near the carbon atom. The chemical shift, measured in parts per million (ppm), reflects the local magnetic field experienced by the nucleus, which is shielded by the surrounding electron density. Electronegative substituents, like chlorine, tend to withdraw electron density, \"deshielding\" the nucleus and causing it to resonate at a higher frequency, which corresponds to a larger, more positive chemical shift value (a downfield shift).\n\nThe problem specifies the target molecule as $1$-chloropropane, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}$, and the carbon of interest as the $\\alpha$-carbon, which is the methylene carbon directly bonded to the chlorine atom ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}$).\n\nWe are provided with the necessary parameters for the additive model:\n1.

In this specific case, we are considering only the effect of the single $\\alpha$-chlorine substituent on the methylene baseline. The effects of the more distant ethyl group ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$) are implicitly included in the choice of the methylene carbon baseline, which accounts for a standard alkane chain environment.

A larger chemical shift value ($\\delta$) corresponds to a greater degree of deshielding and a resonance at a lower applied magnetic field (or higher frequency), referred to as \"downfield\". A smaller $\\delta$ value corresponds to greater shielding and a resonance at a higher applied magnetic field, referred to as \"upfield\".\n\nThe methyl group is generally considered an electron-donating group (EDG).

This is consistent with the negative $\\beta$-increment ($\\delta_{\\beta} = -8.0 \\text{ ppm}$), resulting in $\\delta(C^1) = 115.0 \\text{ ppm}$, which is upfield from the ethylene base value.\n\nTherefore, the substituted carbon $C^2$ is the lower-field carbon ($\\delta = 136.0 \\text{ ppm}$), and the terminal carbon $C^1$ is the higher-field carbon ($\\delta = 115.0 \\text{ ppm}$).\n\nThe final results, $136.0$ and $115.0$, are already expressed to four significant figures.

This implies the presence of either one alkyne ($\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{C}$) or two alkenes ($\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$). A cyclic structure with unsaturation is also possible.\n    - The problem states there are **no resonances** in the region $\\delta 100\\text{–}150\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. This is the characteristic region for alkene ($sp^2$) carbons. The absence of signals in this range compellingly rules out the presence of any double bonds. Therefore, the molecule cannot be an alkene, a diene, or a cycloalkene.\n    - With double bonds ruled out, the DoU of $2$ must be accounted for by a triple bond. The molecule must be an alkyne. Bicyclic alkanes are a possibility, but the signals observed do not fit that profile well.\n    - The standard chemical shift range for alkyne ($sp$) carbons is $\\delta 65\\text{–}90\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$. The spectrum shows two signals at $\\delta 76.3\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and $\\delta 83.8\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$, which fall perfectly within this range. The upfield shift of alkyne carbons relative to alkene carbons is a well-known consequence of the magnetic anisotropy of the cylindrical $\\pi$-electron system of the triple bond, which creates a shielding cone along the bond axis.\n    - The remaining signals are between $\\delta 10\\text{–}40\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$, which is the typical region for saturated, alkane-like $sp^3$ carbons. This is consistent with the four remaining carbons of the alkyl chain attached to the alkyne functional group.\n\n2.  **Analysis of DEPT-135 Data:**\n    - A DEPT-135 spectrum distinguishes carbon types based on the number of attached protons: $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ and $\\mathrm{CH}$ signals are positive, $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ signals are negative, and quaternary ($\\mathrm{C}$) signals are absent.\n    - The signal at $\\delta 76.3\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ (an $sp$ carbon) is identified as a $\\mathrm{CH}$ group. This indicates an sp carbon bonded to one hydrogen atom. This is characteristic of a terminal alkyne, specifically the acetylenic carbon ($\\equiv\\mathrm{C}\\text{–}\\mathrm{H}$).\n    - The signal at $\\delta 83.8\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ (the other $sp$ carbon) is identified as a quaternary carbon. This means it has no attached hydrogens. In a terminal alkyne of the form $\\mathrm{R}\\text{–}\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{C}\\text{–}\\mathrm{H}$, the carbon atom bonded to the R group is quaternary.\n    - An internal alkyne ($\\mathrm{R}\\text{–}\\mathrm{C}\\equiv\\mathrm{C}\\text{–}\\mathrm{R}'$) would have two quaternary $sp$ carbons, and both signals would be absent in the DEPT-135 spectrum. This contradicts the observation of a $\\mathrm{CH}$ signal in the alkyne region.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    All evidence points to the unknown hydrocarbon being a **terminal alkyne**. It has a molecular formula of $\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{10}$ (DoU = $2$), its two $sp$ carbons appear in the $\\delta 70\\text{–}90\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ region, it shows no signals in the $sp^2$ region ($\\delta 100\\text{–}150\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$), and the DEPT-135 spectrum confirms the presence of one $\\equiv\\mathrm{C}\\text{–}\\mathrm{H}$ carbon and one $\\mathrm{R}\\text{–}\\mathrm{C}\\equiv$ quaternary carbon.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Values of $\\delta 76.3\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and $\\delta 83.8\\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ are far too deshielded for allylic carbons in a hydrocarbon.

This contradicts the data showing a $\\mathrm{CH}$ signal.\n- The claim that long-range polarization transfer would cause a quaternary carbon to appear as a $\\mathrm{CH}$ signal in a standard DEPT-135 experiment is incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.
