It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the full solution.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nThe evolution of the longitudinal component of magnetization, $M_z$, during the recycle delay $TR$ (in the absence of a radiofrequency field) is described by the longitudinal Bloch equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_z}{dt} = -\\frac{M_z(t) - M_0}{T_1}\n$$\nwhere $M_0$ is the equilibrium magnetization and $T_1$ is the spin-lattice relaxation time. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Its general solution, representing the recovery of magnetization from an initial value $M_z(0)$ at time $t=0$, is:\n$$\nM_z(t) = M_0 + \\left( M_z(0) - M_0 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nThe experiment employs a sequence of identical $90^{\\circ}$ pulses. An ideal $90^{\\circ}$ pulse rotates any existing longitudinal magnetization into the transverse plane. Therefore, immediately after any such pulse, the longitudinal magnetization is zero. Let $M_{z}^{\\mathrm{ss}}$ be the steady-state longitudinal magnetization immediately *before* a pulse.\nImmediately after the pulse, the magnetization becomes $M_z(0) = M_{z}^{\\mathrm{ss}} \\cos(90^{\\circ}) = 0$.\nDuring the subsequent recycle delay of duration $TR$, the magnetization relaxes from this initial value of $0$. We use the general solution for $M_z(t)$ with $M_z(0) = 0$ and $t=TR$:\n$$\nM_z(TR) = M_0 + \\left( 0 - M_0 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right) = M_0 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nIn the steady state, the magnetization at the end of the relaxation delay must be equal to the magnetization at the start of the next cycle (i.e., just before the next pulse). Thus, the steady-state magnetization before a pulse is:\n$$\nM_{z}^{\\mathrm{ss}} = M_0 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis equation provides the derived dependence of the observable longitudinal magnetization on the recycle delay $TR$ and the relaxation time $T_1$.\n\nThe problem states that the observed signal intensity, $I$, is proportional to this steady-state magnetization. Let the proportionality constant be $k$.\n$$\nI = k M_{z}^{\\mathrm{ss}} = k M_0 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nWe need to find the ratio of intensities for the two carbons, designated 'long' and 'short'.\nFor the carbon with the short relaxation time:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{short}} = k M_0 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_{1,\\mathrm{short}}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nFor the carbon with the long relaxation time:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{long}} = k M_0 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_{1,\\mathrm{long}}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $I_{\\mathrm{long}} / I_{\\mathrm{short}}$. Since $k$ and $M_0$ are assumed to be the same for both carbons, they cancel out in the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{long}}}{I_{\\mathrm{short}}} = \\frac{k M_0 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_{1,\\mathrm{long}}}\\right) \\right)}{k M_0 \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_{1,\\mathrm{short}}}\\right) \\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_{1,\\mathrm{long}}}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_{1,\\mathrm{short}}}\\right)}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $TR = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $T_{1,\\mathrm{short}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $T_{1,\\mathrm{long}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{long}}}{I_{\\mathrm{short}}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5.0}{10}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5.0}{1}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.5)}{1 - \\exp(-5.0)}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{long}}}{I_{\\mathrm{short}}} = \\frac{1 - 0.6065306...}{1 - 0.0067379...} = \\frac{0.3934693...}{0.9932620...} \\approx 0.3961358...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.3961$.

It accurately describes a common issue in quantitative $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR spectroscopy and provides all necessary parameters for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental premise is that the signal intensity, $I$, for a given class of carbon nuclei is proportional to the product of several factors: the number of carbons in that class, $n$; the equilibrium magnetization, $M_{0}$; a recovery factor, $S$; and the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) enhancement factor, $E$.

We are asked to find the total integrated intensity for each category. For the $n_{p}$ protonated carbons, the total intensity, $I_{p}$, is the sum of the intensities of all protonated carbon signals. Since the parameters $M_{0}$, $S_{p}$, and $E_{p}$ are stated to be uniform for all protonated carbons, their total intensity is given by:\n$$\nI_{p} = k \\cdot n_{p} \\cdot M_{0} \\cdot S_{p} \\cdot E_{p}\n$$\nSimilarly, for the $n_{q}$ quaternary carbons, the total intensity, $I_{q}$, is:\n$$\nI_{q} = k \\cdot n_{q} \\cdot M_{0} \\cdot S_{q} \\cdot E_{q}\n$$\nThe problem states that the equilibrium magnetization $M_{0}$ is identical for all carbons, and that due to identical full relaxation, the recovery factors are equal, $S_{p} = S_{q}$.\n\nThe first objective is to compute the integrated intensity ratio, $R$, defined as $R = I_{p}/I_{q}$. Using the expressions for $I_{p}$ and $I_{q}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{I_{p}}{I_{q}} = \\frac{k \\cdot n_{p} \\cdot M_{0} \\cdot S_{p} \\cdot E_{p}}{k \\cdot n_{q} \\cdot M_{0} \\cdot S_{q} \\cdot E_{q}}\n$$\nThe constants $k$ and $M_{0}$ cancel, as do the equal factors $S_{p}$ and $S_{q}$. The expression for $R$ simplifies to:\n$$\nR = \\frac{n_{p} E_{p}}{n_{q} E_{q}}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Number of protonated carbons, $n_{p} = 5$.\n- Number of quaternary carbons, $n_{q} = 3$.\n- NOE factor for protonated carbons, $E_{p} = 2.0$.\n- NOE factor for quaternary carbons, $E_{q} = 1.0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{5 \\times 2.0}{3 \\times 1.0} = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the true carbon count ratio, $C$, defined as $C = n_{p}/n_{q}$.\n$$\nC = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the quantitation error, $\\epsilon$, defined by the formula:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{R - C}{C}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values of $R$ and $C$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{5}{3}}{\\frac{5}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}}{\\frac{5}{3}} = 1\n$$\nThis result indicates a quantitation error of $100\\%$, which arises because the signal from the protonated carbons is artificially enhanced by a factor of $2.0$ due to the NOE, while the signal from the quaternary carbons receives no such enhancement. The measured intensity ratio $R$ is therefore twice the true carbon count ratio $C$.\n\nAs an alternative path to the same result, the expression for $\\epsilon$ can be simplified first:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{R}{C} - 1 = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_{p} E_{p}}{n_{q} E_{q}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{n_{p}}{n_{q}}\\right)} - 1 = \\frac{E_{p}}{E_{q}} - 1\n$$\nThis shows that under the given assumptions, the fractional error is independent of the number of carbons and depends solely on the ratio of the NOE enhancement factors. Substituting the values for $E_{p}$ and $E_{q}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{2.0}{1.0} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer for $\\epsilon$ to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.
