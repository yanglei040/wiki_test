The Karplus relationship, which correlates vicinal coupling constants with dihedral angles, is a fundamental and empirically well-established tool for stereochemical analysis of organic molecules. The specified parameter values are physically realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a specific mathematical model (the canonical three-term Karplus equation) and all necessary parameters ($A$, $B$, $C$) and independent variables ($\\phi$) to compute a unique set of solutions for $^{3}J_{HH}$.

The mention of \"Haasnoot–Altona parameterization\" serves to identify the source of the specific coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$, while the phrase \"in the canonical Karplus dependence\" explicitly dictates the use of the standard three-term equation. It is thus self-contained and ready for solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe vicinal proton-proton coupling constant, $^{3}J_{HH}$, is estimated using the canonical Karplus equation, which relates the coupling constant to the dihedral angle $\\phi$ between the two protons. The equation is given by:\n\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(\\phi) = A \\cos^2(\\phi) + B \\cos(\\phi) + C\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the specific coefficients for a generic $\\text{H-C-C-H}$ fragment: $A = 7.09\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $B = -1.01\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, and $C = 0.62\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. We will substitute these values and the given dihedral angles into the equation. The angles must be converted to radians for trigonometric functions in most computational systems, but the values of cosine for $60^{\\circ}$, $180^{\\circ}$, and $300^{\\circ}$ are exact and well-known.\n\n**1. Calculation for $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$**\n\nThe dihedral angle is $\\phi = 60^\\circ$. The cosine of this angle is:\n$$\n\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Karplus equation:\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(60^\\circ) = (7.09\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\cdot (\\cos(60^\\circ))^2 + (-1.01\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ) + 0.62\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(60^\\circ) = (7.09) \\cdot (0.5)^2 + (-1.01) \\cdot (0.5) + 0.62\n$$\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(60^\\circ) = (7.09) \\cdot (0.25) - 0.505 + 0.62\n$$\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(60^\\circ) = 1.7725 - 0.505 + 0.62 = 1.8875\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(60^\\circ) \\approx 1.888\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\n**2.

The cosine of this angle is:\n$$\n\\cos(180^\\circ) = -1\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Karplus equation:\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(180^\\circ) = (7.09\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\cdot (\\cos(180^\\circ))^2 + (-1.01\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\cdot \\cos(180^\\circ) + 0.62\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(180^\\circ) = (7.09) \\cdot (-1)^2 + (-1.01) \\cdot (-1) + 0.62\n$$\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(180^\\circ) = (7.09) \\cdot (1) + 1.01 + 0.62\n$$\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(180^\\circ) = 7.09 + 1.01 + 0.62 = 8.72\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n^{3}J_{HH}(180^\\circ) = 8.720\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\n**3.

This relatively large value is characteristic of an *anti* arrangement of vicinal protons. In this geometry, the orbitals involved in the coupling pathway (the $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bonding orbital of one proton and the $\\mathrm{C-H}$ antibonding orbital of the other) have optimal overlap, leading to strong scalar coupling. Typical experimental values for anti couplings in saturated, unstrained systems are in the range of $8$–$13\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is consistent with our calculation.\n\n-   **$\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi = 300^{\\circ}$ (syn-clinal/gauche conformations):** The calculated coupling constant for both of these angles is $1.888\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This small value is characteristic of a *gauche* arrangement of vicinal protons. At these dihedral angles, the overlap between the relevant sigma-orbitals is much poorer than in the anti case, resulting in significantly weaker coupling. Typical experimental values for gauche couplings are in the range of $1$–$5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is also consistent with our calculation.\n\nIn summary, the Karplus relationship correctly predicts that the $^{3}J_{HH}$ coupling will be maximal for an anti-periplanar geometry ($\\phi=180^{\\circ}$) and significantly smaller for gauche geometries ($\\phi \\approx \\pm 60^{\\circ}$), providing a powerful method for determining molecular conformation from NMR spectra.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.888 & 8.720 & 1.888 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3705678"}, {"introduction": "In chiral molecules or environments, protons that appear chemically identical, such as those in a $\\mathrm{-CH_2-}$ group, are often diastereotopic and thus magnetically non-equivalent.

I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\n**The AB Spin System (Experiment i)**\n\nFor two coupled spin-$1/2$ nuclei, $A$ and $B$, with Larmor frequencies $ν_A$ and $ν_B$ and scalar coupling $J_{AB}$, the chemical shift difference is $\\Delta\\nu = |ν_A - ν_B|$. The system is second-order when $\\Delta\\nu$ is not much larger than $|J_{AB}|$. The quantum mechanical analysis yields four allowed transitions, resulting in a characteristic \"AB quartet\".\n\nThe frequencies of these four lines are given by:\n$\\nu_1 = \\nu_{avg} + \\frac{1}{2}(C + J_{AB})$\n$\\nu_2 = \\nu_{avg} + \\frac{1}{2}(C - J_{AB})$\n$\\nu_3 = \\nu_{avg} - \\frac{1}{2}(C - J_{AB})$\n$\\nu_4 = \\nu_{avg} - \\frac{1}{2}(C + J_{AB})$\nwhere $\\nu_{avg} = (ν_A + ν_B)/2$ is the center of the multiplet, and $C = \\sqrt{\\Delta\\nu^2 + J_{AB}^2}$.\n\nFor a consistent analysis, we must consider line positions independent of the sign of $J_{AB}$. The four lines can be grouped into two pairs (doublets), where the splitting within each pair is $|J_{AB}|$. The separation between the centers of these two doublets is $C = \\sqrt{\\Delta\\nu^2 + J_{AB}^2}$.\nThe four line positions, sorted by frequency, are:\n$\\nu_{pos,1} = \\nu_{avg} + \\frac{1}{2}C + \\frac{1}{2}|J_{AB}|$\n$\\nu_{pos,2} = \\nu_{avg} + \\frac{1}{2}C - \\frac{1}{2}|J_{AB}|$\n$\\nu_{pos,3} = \\nu_{avg} - \\frac{1}{2}C + \\frac{1}{2}|J_{AB}|$\n$\\nu_{pos,4} = \\nu_{avg} - \\frac{1}{2}C - \\frac{1}{2}|J_{AB}|$\n\nThe separation of the two outermost lines is $s_{\\text{out}} = \\nu_{pos,1} - \\nu_{pos,4} = C + |J_{AB}|$.\nThe separation of the two innermost lines is $s_{\\text{in}} = \\nu_{pos,2} - \\nu_{pos,3} = C - |J_{AB}|$. Note that $C = \\sqrt{\\Delta\\nu^2 + J_{AB}^2} > |J_{AB}|$ for any $\\Delta\\nu \\neq 0$, so $s_{\\text{in}}$ is positive.\n\nFrom these two relations, we can derive expressions for $|J_{AB}|$ and $\\Delta\\nu$:\n1.  $(s_{\\text{out}} - s_{\\text{in}}) = (C + |J_{AB}|) - (C - |J_{AB}|) = 2|J_{AB}| \\implies |J_{AB}| = \\frac{s_{\\text{out}} - s_{\\text{in}}}{2}$\n2.  $(s_{\\text{out}} + s_{\\text{in}}) = (C + |J_{AB}|) + (C - |J_{AB}|) = 2C = 2\\sqrt{\\Delta\\nu^2 + J_{AB}^2}$\n3.  Multiplying the two: $s_{\\text{out}} s_{\\text{in}} = (C + |J_{AB}|)(C - |J_{AB}|) = C^2 - J_{AB}^2 = (\\Delta\\nu^2 + J_{AB}^2) - J_{AB}^2 = \\Delta\\nu^2 \\implies \\Delta\\nu = \\sqrt{s_{\\text{out}} s_{\\text{in}}}$.\n\n**The ABX Spin System (Experiment ii)**\n\nWhen the couplings to the remote proton $X$ ($^{3}J_{AX}$ and $^{3}J_{BX}$) are included, and because $X$ is weakly coupled, the $AB$ part of the spectrum can be treated as a superposition of two separate $AB$ sub-spectra. One sub-spectrum arises from the half of the molecules where the $X$ spin is $\\alpha$ (up), and the other from the half where the $X$ spin is $\\beta$ (down).\n\n-   For the $X=\\alpha$ sub-spectrum, the effective Larmor frequencies are $ν'_A = ν_A + \\frac{1}{2}J_{AX}$ and $ν'_B = ν_B + \\frac{1}{2}J_{BX}$. The effective chemical shift difference is $\\Delta\\nu' = |ν'_A - ν'_B| = |(ν_A - ν_B) + \\frac{1}{2}(J_{AX} - J_{BX})|$.\n-   For the $X=\\beta$ sub-spectrum, the effective Larmor frequencies are $ν''_A = ν_A - \\frac{1}{2}J_{AX}$ and $ν''_B = ν_B - \\frac{1}{2}J_{BX}$. The effective chemical shift difference is $\\Delta\\nu'' = |ν''_A - ν''_B| = |(ν_A - ν_B) - \\frac{1}{2}(J_{AX} - J_{BX})|$.\n\nSince $J_{AX} \\neq J_{BX}$, we have $\\Delta\\nu' \\neq \\Delta\\nu''$. Therefore, the $AB$ part of the $ABX$ spectrum consists of two different $AB$ quartets superimposed, which generally results in up to 8 distinct lines.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. From the $AB$ pattern in experiment (i), the relations $s_{\\text{out}} - s_{\\text{in}} = 2|^{2}J_{AB}|$ and $s_{\\text{out}} + s_{\\text{in}} = 2\\sqrt{\\Delta\\nu^{2} + (^{2}J_{AB})^{2}}$ hold, allowing extraction of $|^{2}J_{AB}|$ and $\\Delta\\nu$.**\nAs shown in the principle-based derivation, subtracting the equations for $s_{\\text{out}}$ and $s_{\\text{in}}$ gives $s_{\\text{out}} - s_{\\text{in}} = 2|^{2}J_{AB}|$. Adding them gives $s_{\\text{out}} + s_{\\textin} = 2C = 2\\sqrt{\\Delta\\nu^2 + (^{2}J_{AB})^2}$. These two equations can be solved sequentially for $|^{2}J_{AB}|$ and then for $\\Delta\\nu$. The statement is a correct representation of the analysis of an $AB$ quartet.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In experiment (ii), because $|ν_{X} - ν_{A}|$ and $|ν_{X} - ν_{B}|$ are large, the $AB$ manifold remains four lines; the presence of $^{3}J_{AX}$ and $^{3}J_{BX}$ does not increase the number of lines but only changes their intensities.**\nAs derived above, the coupling to $X$ splits the $AB$ quartet into two distinct $AB$ sub-quartets because $J_{AX} \\neq J_{BX}$. The superposition of these two 4-line patterns will in general produce an 8-line spectrum in the $AB$ region. The number of lines doubles, not just their intensities change. The statement is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In the special case that the environment were achiral for a prochiral methylene so that $\\Delta\\nu \\to 0$ while $^{2}J_{AB} \\neq 0$, and with $X$ decoupled, the two protons $A$ and $B$ become chemically and magnetically equivalent and the geminal coupling would not be observed; the $-\\text{CH}_{2}-$ resonance would collapse to a single line at the average chemical shift.**\nIf $\\Delta\\nu \\to 0$, protons $A$ and $B$ become chemically equivalent, forming an $A_2$ spin system. For an isolated $A_2$ system, the spins are also magnetically equivalent. The Hamiltonian for an $A_2$ system has eigenstates that form a triplet (total spin $S=1$) and a singlet ($S=0$). Transitions are only allowed between states of the same total spin, so only transitions within the triplet manifold are NMR-active. The analysis of these transitions shows that they all occur at the same frequency, $ν_A = ν_B$. The coupling constant $J_{AB}$ affects the energy levels but not the transition frequencies. Thus, the spectrum of an $A_2$ system is a single sharp line, and the coupling is not observed.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The characteristic $AB$ “roofing” distortion reverses direction upon changing the sign of $^{2}J_{AB}$ at fixed $\\Delta\\nu$.**\nThe \"roofing\" or intensity distortion in an $AB$ quartet is the phenomenon where the two inner lines are more intense than the two outer lines. The line positions and their relative intensities are functions of $\\Delta\\nu$ and $J_{AB}$. Crucially, the appearance of the spectrum (the set of line positions and their corresponding intensities) is solely dependent on $\\Delta\\nu^2$ and $J_{AB}^2$. Changing the sign of $J_{AB}$ does not change $J_{AB}^2$. What happens is that the assignment of quantum mechanical transitions to the physical lines is permuted, but the final observable spectrum is identical. Therefore, one cannot determine the sign of $J_{AB}$ from a simple $AB$ spectrum, and the roofing distortion does not reverse.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If the spectrometer frequency $ν_{0}$ is doubled while $\\Delta\\delta$ (in parts per million) and all $J$ couplings remain unchanged, then $\\Delta\\nu$ (in Hertz) doubles and $|^{2}J_{AB}/\\Delta\\nu|$ halves. The $AB$ second-order distortion diminishes, and in the $ABX$ case each methylene proton tends toward an apparent first-order doublet of doublets with splittings $|^{2}J_{AB}|$ and its own $^{3}J$ to $X$.**\nThis statement describes the effect of increasing the magnetic field strength.\n1.  $\\Delta\\nu \\text{[Hz]} = ν_0 \\text{[Hz]} \\times \\Delta\\delta \\text{[ppm]}$. If $ν_0$ doubles and $\\Delta\\delta$ is constant, $\\Delta\\nu$ in Hz doubles. (Correct)\n2.  Scalar couplings $J$ are field-independent, so they remain constant in Hz. (Correct)\n3.  The ratio $|^{2}J_{AB}/\\Delta\\nu|$ will change to $|^{2}J_{AB}/(2\\Delta\\nu)|$, which is half the original value. (Correct)\n4.  The magnitude of second-order effects is determined by the ratio $|J/\\Delta\\nu|$. As this ratio decreases, the system becomes more first-order. So, the distortion diminishes. (Correct)\n5.  In the first-order limit ($\\Delta\\nu \\gg |J_{AB}|, |J_{AX}|, |J_{BX}|$), the $ABX$ system behaves as an $AMX$ system. Proton $A$ is split by $M$ (formerly $B$) and $X$, and proton $M$ is split by $A$ and $X$. Thus, proton $A$ will appear as a doublet of doublets with splittings $|^{2}J_{AM}| = |^{2}J_{AB}|$ and $|^{3}J_{AX}|$. Similarly for proton $M (B)$. The statement is entirely accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F.

The value $0.0945\\,\\text{ppm}$ is a correct rounding.\nAll calculations are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**G. The sign of $^{2}J_{AB}$ can be determined from $s_{\\text{in}}$ and $s_{\\text{out}}$ alone in experiment (i).**\nAs established in the analysis of option D, the line separations $s_{\\text{in}}$ and $s_{\\text{out}}$ depend on $|J_{AB}|$ and $J_{AB}^2$, but not on the sign of $J_{AB}$. The entire $AB$ spectrum is invariant to a change in the sign of $J_{AB}$.

This computational exercise bridges theory and experiment by guiding you to calculate an observable $^3J_{HH}$ coupling constant as a Boltzmann-weighted average across a set of conformations [@problem_id:3705662]. This approach is fundamental to correctly interpreting NMR data for flexible molecules and connecting it to their underlying conformational landscape.", "problem": "A flexible organic molecule with vicinal hydrogen-hydrogen coupling exhibits Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spin-spin coupling constants that depend on conformation. In particular, the vicinal coupling constant $^{3}J_{HH}$ depends on the dihedral angle $\\phi$ between the coupled hydrogens. A well-tested empirical relationship for vicinal hydrogen-hydrogen coupling is the Karplus equation, which relates $^{3}J_{HH}$ to the dihedral angle $\\phi$ by a trigonometric function. In an ensemble of conformations sampled from Molecular Dynamics (MD), the ensemble-averaged coupling $\\langle ^{3}J_{HH} \\rangle$ must be computed by weighting each sampled conformation according to its canonical ensemble probability at absolute temperature $T$.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- The canonical ensemble probability for a state with molar potential energy $E_i$ at absolute temperature $T$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor $\\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{E_i}{R T}\\right)$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant.

The averaging is performed over a set of discrete conformations sampled from a simulation, where each conformation $i$ is characterized by a dihedral angle $\\phi_i$ and a molar potential energy $E_i$. The calculation must be performed at a given absolute temperature $T$.\n\nThe theoretical framework for this calculation is rooted in statistical mechanics, specifically the canonical ensemble. The ensemble average of any observable quantity $X$ is given by the weighted sum over all states (conformations) $i$:\n$$ \\langle X \\rangle = \\sum_i p_i X_i $$\nwhere $p_i$ is the probability of finding the system in state $i$.\n\nIn the canonical ensemble, the probability $p_i$ of a state with molar energy $E_i$ at absolute temperature $T$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$ p_i = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i}{R T}\\right)}{\\sum_j \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_j}{R T}\\right)} $$\nHere, $R$ is the molar gas constant, and the term $\\exp(-E_i / (RT))$ is the Boltzmann weight of state $i$, which we can denote as $w_i$.

The Boltzmann weight for each state is $w_i = \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$. For improved numerical stability, especially when dealing with large energy values, it is prudent to subtract the minimum energy $E_{\\min}$ from all energies before computing the weights: $E'_i = E_i - E_{\\min}$. The weights are then $w_i = \\exp(-(E'_i)/(RT))$. This is mathematically equivalent as the resulting constant factor $\\exp(E_{\\min}/(RT))$ cancels between the numerator and denominator, but it prevents numerical underflow or overflow.\n5.  **Compute the Weighted Sum**: Calculate the numerator of the average, which is the sum of the products of each coupling constant and its corresponding Boltzmann weight: $\\mathrm{Num} = \\sum_i J(\\phi_i) w_i$.\n6.  **Compute the Partition Function**: Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of all Boltzmann weights (the partition function): $\\mathrm{Den} = \\sum_i w_i$.\n7.  **Calculate the Final Average**: The ensemble-averaged coupling is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator: $\\langle ^{3}J_{HH} \\rangle = \\frac{\\mathrm{Num}}{\\mathrm{Den}}$.\n8.  **Format Output**: The final result for each case must be rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThis procedure will be applied to each of the five test cases provided.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the ensemble-averaged NMR vicinal coupling constant based on\n    the Karplus equation and Boltzmann weighting for a series of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the molar gas constant in J mol^-1 K^-1\n    R = 8.31446261815324\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: ((A, B, C), phi_deg, E_kj_mol, T_k)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: Typical anti/gauche population at ambient temperature\n        ((7.6, -1.3, 1.0), [60.0, 180.0], [1.5, 0.0], 298.0),\n        # Case 2: Uniform sampling over six staggered angles with equal energy\n        ((7.6, -1.3, 1.0), [0.0, 60.0, 120.0, 180.0, 240.0, 300.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 298.0),\n        # Case 3: Low-temperature limit emphasizing the minimum-energy conformer\n        ((7.6, -1.3, 1.0), [60.0, 180.0], [1.5, 0.0], 50.0),\n        # Case 4: High-temperature limit approaching equal weighting\n        ((7.6, -1.3, 1.0), [60.0, 180.0], [1.5, 0.0], 50000.0),\n        # Case 5: Single conformer boundary case\n        ((7.6, -1.3, 1.0), [60.0], [0.0], 298.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        karplus_coeffs, phi_deg, E_kj_mol, T_k = case\n        A, B, C = karplus_coeffs\n\n        # Convert inputs to NumPy arrays for vectorized operations\n        phi_deg_arr = np.array(phi_deg)\n        E_kj_mol_arr = np.array(E_kj_mol)\n\n        # Step 1: Convert units\n        # Angles from degrees to radians\n        phi_rad_arr = np.deg2rad(phi_deg_arr)\n        # Energies from kJ/mol to J/mol\n        E_j_mol_arr = E_kj_mol_arr * 1000.0\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate J(phi) for each conformation\n        # J(phi) = A*cos^2(phi) + B*cos(phi) + C\n        cos_phi = np.cos(phi_rad_arr)\n        J_values = A * cos_phi**2 + B * cos_phi + C\n\n        # Step 3: Calculate Boltzmann weights with numerical stability\n        # The term RT in the denominator\n        RT = R * T_k\n        \n        # Avoid underflow/overflow by shifting energies relative to the minimum\n        if E_j_mol_arr.size > 0:\n            E_min = np.min(E_j_mol_arr)\n            relative_E = E_j_mol_arr - E_min\n        else:\n            relative_E = np.array([])\n        \n        # The exponent can be zero, which is safe.\n        with np.errstate(divide='ignore'): # Ignore division by zero if T=0, though not in tests\n            exponents = -relative_E / RT\n        \n        boltzmann_weights = np.exp(exponents)\n\n        # Step 4: Calculate the ensemble average\n        # <J> = sum(J_i * w_i) / sum(w_i)\n        numerator = np.sum(J_values * boltzmann_weights)\n        denominator = np.sum(boltzmann_weights)\n\n        # Handle the case of no conformations or zero weights sum to avoid division by zero\n        if denominator == 0:\n            # This case implies no thermally accessible states, result is undefined.\n            # For a single conformer, denominator is > 0.\n            # Using 0.0 as a fallback, though not expected for given tests.\n            avg_J = 0.0 \n        else:\n            avg_J = numerator / denominator\n\n        # Step 5: Round result to three decimal places\n        results.append(round(avg_J, 3))\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # Using a custom formatter to ensure .0 is appended for whole numbers\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.3f}\" for res in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3705662"}]}
