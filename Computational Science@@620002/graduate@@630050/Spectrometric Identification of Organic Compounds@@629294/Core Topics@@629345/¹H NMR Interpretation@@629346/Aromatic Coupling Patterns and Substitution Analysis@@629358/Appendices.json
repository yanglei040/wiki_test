For a system of three spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ nuclei $H_a$, $H_b$, and $H_c$, this Hamiltonian, expressed in frequency units ($\\text{Hz}$), is:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathcal{H}} = \\nu_a \\hat{I}_{za} + \\nu_b \\hat{I}_{zb} + \\nu_c \\hat{I}_{zc} + J_{ab} \\hat{I}_{za} \\hat{I}_{zb} + J_{ac} \\hat{I}_{za} \\hat{I}_{zc} + J_{bc} \\hat{I}_{zb} \\hat{I}_{zc} $$\nHere, $\\nu_i$ is the Larmor frequency of nucleus $i$ in the absence of coupling, $\\hat{I}_{zi}$ is the operator for the $z$-component of the spin angular momentum of nucleus $i$, and $J_{ij}$ is the scalar coupling constant between nuclei $i$ and $j$.\n\nIn the first-order approximation, the product states $|m_a m_b m_c\\rangle$ are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, where $m_i$ is the magnetic quantum number of spin $i$ ($m_i = +\\frac{1}{2}$ for spin state $|\\alpha\\rangle$ and $m_i = -\\frac{1}{2}$ for spin state $|\\beta\\rangle$). The energy eigenvalue $E$ of a state $|m_a m_b m_c\\rangle$ is given by:\n$$ E(m_a, m_b, m_c) = \\langle m_a m_b m_c | \\hat{\\mathcal{H}} | m_a m_b m_c \\rangle $$\n$$ E(m_a, m_b, m_c) = \\nu_a m_a + \\nu_b m_b + \\nu_c m_c + J_{ab} m_a m_b + J_{ac} m_a m_c + J_{bc} m_b m_c $$\nAn NMR transition for nucleus $H_a$ is governed by the selection rule $\\Delta m_a = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m_j = 0$ for $j \\neq a$.

The introduction of the smaller meta coupling ($J_{ac} = 2.0\\,\\text{Hz}$) further splits each of these two lines. The line at $\\nu_a + \\frac{1}{2}J_{ab}$ splits into a doublet separated by $J_{ac}$, and the line at $\\nu_a - \\frac{1}{2}J_{ab}$ also splits into a doublet separated by $J_{ac}$. Consequently, the total number of lines increases from $2$ to $4$. The resulting pattern is termed a \"doublet of doublets\".\n- **Relative Intensities**: Under first-order conditions, the populations of the initial spin states are effectively equal, and all single-quantum transitions have equal intrinsic probabilities. When only $J_{ab}$ is present, the two lines of the doublet have a relative intensity ratio of $1:1$ because each line arises from two degenerate transitions. When the meta coupling $J_{ac}$ is added, the degeneracy is lifted, and the four resulting lines are distinct. Since each line corresponds to a unique, allowed single-quantum transition, they all have equal intensity. Thus, the intensity pattern changes from a $1:1$ doublet to a $1:1:1:1$ quartet (doublet of doublets).", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -4.75 & -2.75 & 2.75 & 4.75 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3693124"}, {"introduction": "Moving from foundational principles to practical application, this final exercise simulates a key task in modern structure elucidation: quantitative hypothesis testing.

It is a valid problem in the domain of spectrometric analysis.\n\nThe objective is to compute a residual value, $R$, for five distinct test cases. This residual quantifies the consistency of measured spin-spin coupling constants with the hypothesis of a $1,3$-disubstituted (meta) aromatic ring structure. The core of this analysis involves evaluating three possible assignments of one ortho-like and two meta-like couplings for a set of three measured coupling constants $\\{J_{AB}, J_{AX}, J_{BX}\\}$.\n\nThe empirical constraints for the coupling constants are given as intervals:\n- Ortho-like coupling: $J_\\text{ortho} \\in [L_o, H_o] = [6.0, 10.0]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- Meta-like coupling: $J_\\text{meta} \\in [L_m, H_m] = [1.0, 3.5]\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nA penalty function, $\\rho(J; \\sigma, [L, H])$, is defined to measure the extent to which a measured coupling constant $J$ with uncertainty $\\sigma$ deviates from its assigned interval $[L, H]$:\n$$\n\\rho(J;\\sigma,[L,H]) \\;=\\; \n\\begin{cases}\n0, & \\text{if } L \\le J \\le H,\\\\\n\\left(\\dfrac{\\min(|J-L|,|J-H|)}{\\sigma}\\right)^2, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function yields a dimensionless, non-negative value. It is zero if the coupling constant falls within the allowed range and a squared, uncertainty-normalized distance from the nearest boundary of the range otherwise.\n\nFor a given set of measured couplings $\\{J_{AB}, J_{AX}, J_{BX}\\}$ and their associated uncertainties $\\{\\sigma_{AB}, \\sigma_{AX}, \\sigma_{BX}\\}$, we must consider three assignments consistent with the meta-substitution hypothesis:\n1.  **Assignment 1**: $J_{AB}$ is ortho-like; $J_{AX}$ and $J_{BX}$ are meta-like. The residual for this assignment, $R_1$, is:\n    $$\n    R_1 = \\rho(J_{AB}; \\sigma_{AB}, [L_o, H_o]) + \\rho(J_{AX}; \\sigma_{AX}, [L_m, H_m]) + \\rho(J_{BX}; \\sigma_{BX}, [L_m, H_m])\n    $$\n2.  **Assignment 2**: $J_{AX}$ is ortho-like; $J_{AB}$ and $J_{BX}$ are meta-like. The residual for this assignment, $R_2$, is:\n    $$\n    R_2 = \\rho(J_{AB}; \\sigma_{AB}, [L_m, H_m]) + \\rho(J_{AX}; \\sigma_{AX}, [L_o, H_o]) + \\rho(J_{BX}; \\sigma_{BX}, [L_m, H_m])\n    $$\n3.  **Assignment 3**: $J_{BX}$ is ortho-like; $J_{AB}$ and $J_{AX}$ are meta-like. The residual for this assignment, $R_3$, is:\n    $$\n    R_3 = \\rho(J_{AB}; \\sigma_{AB}, [L_m, H_m]) + \\rho(J_{AX}; \\sigma_{AX}, [L_m, H_m]) + \\rho(J_{BX}; \\sigma_{BX}, [L_o, H_o])\n    $$\n\nThe final meta hypothesis residual, $R$, for the test case is the minimum of the residuals calculated for the three possible assignments, representing the best possible fit to the hypothesis:\n$$\nR = \\min(R_1, R_2, R_3)\n$$\n\nLet us demonstrate the calculation for Test Case $1$:\n- Given data: $J_{AB}=8.1$, $J_{AX}=2.1$, $J_{BX}=1.9$; $\\sigma_{AB}=0.1$, $\\sigma_{AX}=0.1$, $\\sigma_{BX}=0.1$.
