The principles cited—shielding, hybridization, and magnetic anisotropy—are the correct and fundamental concepts governing chemical shifts. The problem is well-posed, asking for the most consistent assignment of given spectral data to structural fragments based on these principles. The language is objective and precise. The provided chemical shift values are realistic for a molecule containing various types of protons. A crucial piece of information is that the unknown is a \"neutral hydrocarbon\". This constraint must be strictly applied when evaluating the proposed options. Options that include atoms other than carbon and hydrogen (e.g., oxygen, halogens) are inconsistent with this given fact, but this reflects a flaw in the option, not in the problem statement itself. The problem asks to select the *best* option, which implies that some or all but one may be flawed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed question in the field of spectrometric identification of organic compounds. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Analysis of Chemical Shifts\n\nThe chemical shift ($\\delta$) in NMR spectroscopy quantifies the shielding of a nucleus from the applied external magnetic field, $B_0$. A higher $\\delta$ value indicates less shielding (deshielding) and a lower $\\delta$ value indicates more shielding (upfield shift).\n\n1.  **Hybridization and Inductive Effects**: The electronegativity of carbon increases with increasing s-character of the hybrid orbitals: $sp$ ($50\\%$ s-character)  $sp^2$ ($33\\%$ s-character)  $sp^3$ ($25\\%$ s-character). A proton attached to a more electronegative carbon is more deshielded. Thus, based on this effect alone, the trend would be $\\delta(\\text{sp-H}) > \\delta(\\text{sp}^2\\text{-H}) > \\delta(\\text{sp}^3\\text{-H})$. Protons on $sp^3$ carbons (alkyl protons) are generally the most shielded and appear at low $\\delta$ values, typically $\\delta  2.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, unless attached to an electronegative atom or group.\n\n2.  **Magnetic Anisotropy of $\\pi$-Systems**: This effect often dominates over simple hybridization considerations. The circulation of $\\pi$ electrons in the external magnetic field creates a local induced magnetic field that can either shield or deshield nearby protons, depending on their position relative to the $\\pi$-system.\n    -   **Aromatic Protons ($sp^2$)**: The cyclic $\\pi$-electron system (ring current) in an aromatic ring generates a strong induced magnetic field. Protons outside the ring are in a deshielding region, causing a large downfield shift to the $\\delta \\approx 6.5 - 8.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range.\n    -   **Vinylic Protons ($sp^2$)**: Protons attached to a C=C double bond are also in the deshielding zone of the $\\pi$-bond's induced field. They typically resonate in the $\\delta \\approx 4.5 - 6.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range.\n    -   **Acetylenic Protons ($sp$)**: A proton on a C$\\equiv$C triple bond lies along the axis of the cylindrical $\\pi$-electron cloud. In this specific orientation, the proton is in the shielding cone of the induced magnetic field. This strong shielding effect counteracts the deshielding effect from the $sp$ carbon's electronegativity, shifting the resonance significantly upfield to the $\\delta \\approx 2.0 - 3.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ range.\n\n### Analysis of the Observed Resonances\n-   $\\boldsymbol{\\delta = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}}$: This low chemical shift is characteristic of a shielded proton on an $sp^3$ carbon, i.e., a typical alkyl proton.\n-   $\\boldsymbol{\\delta = 2.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}}$: This intermediate chemical shift is too high for a simple alkyl proton but too low for a vinylic proton. It falls within two key regions: (1) an $sp^3$ proton deshielded by an adjacent $\\pi$-system (e.g., benzylic or allylic protons), or (2) an $sp$ acetylenic proton, where magnetic anisotropy causes a unique upfield shift into this range.\n-   $\\boldsymbol{\\delta = 5.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}}$: This chemical shift is squarely in the region for vinylic protons on an $sp^2$ carbon, which are deshielded by the anisotropy of the double bond.\n-   $\\boldsymbol{\\delta = 7.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}}$: This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aromatic proton on an $sp^2$ carbon, strongly deshielded by the aromatic ring current.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\delta = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: $sp^3$ alkyl methyl, fragment $\\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-}$; $\\delta = 2.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: $sp^3$ benzylic methyl, fragment $\\mathrm{Ph-CH_3}$; $\\delta = 5.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: $sp^2$ vinylic proton, fragment $\\mathrm{CH_2=CH-}$; $\\delta = 7.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: $sp^2$ aromatic proton, fragment $\\mathrm{C_6H_5-}$.**\n-   $\\delta = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: Assignment to an $sp^3$ alkyl methyl proton is consistent with fundamental principles.

This option is inconsistent with the problem givens.\n-   $\\delta = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: Assignment to a methyl group on bromine ($\\mathrm{CH_3-Br}$) is incorrect. The strong inductive effect of bromine would shift these protons much further downfield (to approximately $\\delta = 2.7\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$).\n-   $\\delta = 2.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: Assignment to an acetylenic proton is plausible.\n-   $\\delta = 5.9\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: Assignment to a vinylic proton is correct.\n-   $\\delta = 7.3\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$: Assignment to an $sp^3$ benzylic proton is incorrect.

Assume equal prior plausibility for the two structural classes.\n\nUse the following physically motivated and empirically supported modeling assumptions:\n\n- The chemical shift $\\delta$ is defined by $\\delta = \\left(\\nu - \\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)/\\nu_0 \\times 10^6$, where $\\nu$ is the resonance frequency, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the reference frequency (e.g., tetramethylsilane, TMS), and $\\nu_0$ is the spectrometer frequency.\n- The local electronic environment determines the nuclear shielding $\\sigma$, which influences $\\delta$ through $\\nu \\propto (1 - \\sigma)$. Increased $\\pi$-bond anisotropy and ring-current effects typically deshield protons attached to sp² carbons (vinylic) relative to sp³ carbons (benzylic), while strong inductive effects from adjacent heteroatoms can downfield-shift benzylic protons substantially.\n- Population data for similar compounds indicate that the vinylic proton chemical shifts (monosubstituted alkenes) are well approximated by a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_V, \\sigma_V^2)$ with $\\mu_V = 5.7$ ppm and $\\sigma_V = 0.5$ ppm, and the benzylic–heteroatom-adjacent proton chemical shifts are approximated by $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_B, \\sigma_B^2)$ with $\\mu_B = 4.6$ ppm and $\\sigma_B = 0.35$ ppm.\n- The reported span $\\delta = 4.8$–$5.2$ ppm reflects line broadening and/or limited resolution, so the measured resonance center may lie anywhere in this interval.

We need to calculate the posterior probabilities $P(H_V \\mid E)$ and $P(H_B \\mid E)$, and the Bayes factor $K$.\n\n**1. Calculate Likelihoods**\nThe likelihood of the observation $E$ (that $\\delta \\in [4.8, 5.2]$) under each hypothesis is the probability of a random variable drawn from the respective normal distribution falling into this interval. We use the standard score, $Z = (x - \\mu) / \\sigma$, and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$.\n\n- **Likelihood for Vinylic Hypothesis ($H_V$):**\nThe distribution is $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_V=5.7, \\sigma_V=0.5)$.\nThe standard scores for the interval boundaries are:\n$$z_{V,1} = \\frac{4.8 - 5.7}{0.5} = \\frac{-0.9}{0.5} = -1.8$$\n$$z_{V,2} = \\frac{5.2 - 5.7}{0.5} = \\frac{-0.5}{0.5} = -1.0$$\nThe likelihood is:\n$$P(E \\mid H_V) = P(4.8 \\le \\delta_V \\le 5.2) = P(-1.8 \\le Z \\le -1.0) = \\Phi(-1.0) - \\Phi(-1.8)$$\nUsing standard statistical tables or a calculator: $\\Phi(-1.0) \\approx 0.1587$ and $\\Phi(-1.8) \\approx 0.0359$.\n$$P(E \\mid H_V) \\approx 0.1587 - 0.0359 = 0.1228$$\n\n- **Likelihood for Benzylic Hypothesis ($H_B$):**\nThe distribution is $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_B=4.6, \\sigma_B=0.35)$.\nThe standard scores for the interval boundaries are:\n$$z_{B,1} = \\frac{4.8 - 4.6}{0.35} = \\frac{0.2}{0.35} \\approx 0.5714$$\n$$z_{B,2} = \\frac{5.2 - 4.6}{0.35} = \\frac{0.6}{0.35} \\approx 1.7143$$\nThe likelihood is:\n$$P(E \\mid H_B) = P(4.8 \\le \\delta_B \\le 5.2) = P(0.5714 \\le Z \\le 1.7143) = \\Phi(1.7143) - \\Phi(0.5714)$$\nUsing standard statistical tables or a calculator: $\\Phi(1.7143) \\approx 0.9568$ and $\\Phi(0.5714) \\approx 0.7161$.\n$$P(E \\mid H_B) \\approx 0.9568 - 0.7161 = 0.2407$$\n\n**2.

Propose Additional Observables**\nThe ambiguity arises from the overlap in ¹H chemical shifts. The most effective additional observables will be those that have significantly different and non-overlapping values for the two structural motifs.\n1.  **One-Bond C-H Coupling ($^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$):** This coupling constant is strongly dependent on the hybridization of the carbon atom. For an sp² C-H bond, $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ is typically $150-170$ Hz. For an sp³ C-H bond, it is typically $125-150$ Hz. The difference is large and unambiguous. This parameter can be measured via a 2D HSQC experiment.\n2.  **$^{13}\\text{C}$ Chemical Shift:** The chemical shift of the carbon atom to which the proton is attached is highly diagnostic. Alkene (sp²) carbons resonate in the $\\delta_C \\approx 100-150$ ppm range. Benzylic sp³ carbons, even when attached to a heteroatom like oxygen, resonate at much higher field, typically $\\delta_C \\approx 60-80$ ppm (for C-O) or $\\delta_C \\approx 40-60$ ppm (for C-N). The separation between the two possibilities is vast. This is also obtained from an HSQC experiment.\n3.  **Proton-Proton Coupling ($J_{\\text{HH}}$) Patterns:** The multiplicity of the resonance, if resolved, provides critical information.\n    - A monosubstituted alkene proton would be part of a 3-spin system, giving rise to a doublet of doublets with characteristic cis ($^3J \\sim 6-12$ Hz) and trans ($^3J \\sim 12-18$ Hz) couplings.\n    - A benzylic proton in a $\\text{Ph-CH}_2\\text{-O}$ group might be a singlet (if the methylene protons are equivalent) or an AB quartet (if diastereotopic). A benzylic proton in a $\\text{Ph-CH(R)-O}$ group would couple to protons on the adjacent group R, with typical sp³-sp³ vicinal couplings of $^3J \\sim 6-8$ Hz. The coupling patterns and magnitudes are distinctly different from the vinylic case.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $P(\\text{vinylic} \\mid E) \\approx 0.34$, $P(\\text{benzylic} \\mid E) \\approx 0.66$, $K \\approx 0.51$. Most effective additional observables: measure the one-bond carbon–proton coupling $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ (via Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence, HSQC), expecting sp² values $\\sim 160$–$170$ hertz (Hz) versus sp³ benzylic $\\sim 125$–$140$ Hz; determine the attached carbon $^{13}\\text{C}$ chemical shift (sp² $\\sim 110$–$140$ ppm versus benzylic sp³ $\\sim 30$–$45$ ppm); and analyze $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ vinylic coupling patterns (cis $\\sim 10$ Hz, trans $\\sim 16$ Hz, geminal $\\sim 1$–$3$ Hz) versus benzylic patterns (often singlet for $\\text{Ph-CH}_2\\text{-O}$, or simple $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}} \\sim 6$–$8$ Hz to adjacent sp³ protons).**\n- **Quantification:** The calculated probabilities and Bayes factor match my derivation precisely.\n- **Observables:** The proposed observables—$^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$, $^{13}\\text{C}$ chemical shift, and $J_{\\text{HH}}$ coupling patterns—are the three most powerful and standard NMR methods for resolving this ambiguity. The typical value ranges cited are correct and demonstrate the large, discriminating power of these parameters.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. $P(\\text{vinylic} \\mid E) \\approx 0.75$, $P(\\text{benzylic} \\mid E) \\approx 0.25$, $K \\approx 3.0$. Most effective additional observable: Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) difference experiments only, since NOE enhancements will be larger for vinylic protons than benzylic ones.**\n- **Quantification:** The calculated values are incorrect. The evidence favors the benzylic hypothesis ($K  1$), not the vinylic one.\n- **Observables:** Proposing only NOE is a poor strategy. While NOE can provide spatial information, it is not as direct or robust for distinguishing hybridization as the parameters in option A. The assertion that NOEs are always larger for vinylic protons is unfounded and depends entirely on the proximity of other protons in the specific molecular geometry.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. $P(\\text{vinylic} \\mid E) \\approx 0.50$, $P(\\text{benzylic} \\mid E) \\approx 0.50$, $K \\approx 1.0$. Most effective additional observables: infrared (IR) C-H stretching frequency and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption maximum, which directly distinguish sp² from benzylic sp³.**\n- **Quantification:** These values imply the evidence provides no discrimination, which is false. My calculation shows $K \\approx 0.51$, not $1.0$.\n- **Observables:** IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy can be useful. However, in this specific case, the benzylic compound also contains a phenyl group with sp² C-H bonds, which would show absorption in the same region as vinylic C-H bonds in an IR spectrum, creating confounding signals. While other IR or UV features might be diagnostic, the NMR parameters in A are more direct probes of the local environment of the proton in question.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. $P(\\text{vinylic} \\mid E) \\approx 0.40$, $P(\\text{benzylic} \\mid E) \\approx 0.60$, $K \\approx 0.67$. Most effective additional observables: $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ is essentially identical for sp² and benzylic sp³ carbons; therefore, rely on integration and solvent suppression artifacts to separate the possibilities.**\n- **Quantification:** The calculated values are quantitatively incorrect, although they correctly show the evidence favors the benzylic case. The Bayes factor should be $K \\approx 0.51$, not $0.67$.\n- **Observables:** The central claim that \"$^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ is essentially identical for sp² and benzylic sp³ carbons\" is fundamentally false. This statement contradicts well-established spectroscopic principles. Relying on \"artifacts\" is not a valid scientific method for structure determination.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A provides the correct quantitative assessment of uncertainty and proposes the most scientifically sound and effective strategy for resolving the structural ambiguity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3690872"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond specific cases of ambiguity, the ultimate skill is to develop a systematic and robust workflow for structure elucidation.

You are asked to assign the hybridization ($\\mathrm{sp^3}$, $\\mathrm{sp^2}$, or $\\mathrm{sp}$) of the carbon atoms bearing these hydrogens.

The premise that $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ ranges overlap is a verifiable fact.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution Protocol**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the fact that the chemical shift of a proton, $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$, is a secondary effect. It is influenced by many factors beyond just the hybridization of the attached carbon, including the effects of neighboring substituents (inductive and resonance effects), magnetic anisotropy of nearby functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, aromatic rings, alkynes), and environmental factors like solvent and hydrogen bonding. A robust protocol must therefore rely on parameters that are more direct and less ambiguous reporters of hybridization.\n\nFrom first principles, two such parameters are paramount:\n1.  **The one-bond carbon-proton scalar coupling constant, $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$:** The magnitude of this coupling is dominated by the Fermi contact interaction, which is directly proportional to the product of the $s$-character of the carbon and hydrogen atomic orbitals forming the C-H bond. According to the Bent-Walsh rule, the $s$-character of a carbon hybrid orbital is approximately $25\\%$ for $\\mathrm{sp^3}$, $33\\%$ for $\\mathrm{sp^2}$, and $50\\%$ for $\\mathrm{sp}$. This leads to a highly predictable and empirical relationship, often approximated as $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}} \\approx 500 \\times (\\%s)$.\n    -   $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ C-H: $\\sim 25\\%$ $s$-character $\\implies ^{1}J_{\\text{CH}} \\approx 125\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ (Typical range: $120-140\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$).\n    -   $\\mathrm{sp^2}$ C-H: $\\sim 33\\%$ $s$-character $\\implies ^{1}J_{\\text{CH}} \\approx 165\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ (Typical range: $150-180\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$).\n    -   $\\mathrm{sp}$ C-H: $\\sim 50\\%$ $s$-character $\\implies ^{1}J_{\\text{CH}} \\approx 250\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ (Typical range: $200-260\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$).\n    The non-overlapping nature of these ranges makes $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ the most definitive single parameter for determining the hybridization of a carbon bearing a proton.\n\n2.  **The carbon chemical shift, $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})$:** The hybridization of a carbon atom is also a primary determinant of its chemical shift. While subject to substituent effects, the characteristic ranges are largely distinct.\n    -   $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ C: $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C}) \\approx 5-90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n    -   $\\mathrm{sp^2}$ C: $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C}) \\approx 100-160\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n    -   $\\mathrm{sp}$ C: $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C}) \\approx 65-90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n    While there is some overlap between the ranges for $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ carbons bearing electronegative atoms and $\\mathrm{sp}$ carbons, the $\\mathrm{sp^2}$ region is well-separated. Critically, the combination of $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})$ and $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ resolves any residual ambiguity. For instance, an $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ carbon at $\\delta = 80\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (e.g., C-O) would have a $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}} \\approx 140\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, whereas an $\\mathrm{sp}$ carbon at $\\delta = 80\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ would have a $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}} \\approx 250\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nTo implement a protocol based on these principles, one needs experiments that can measure $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})$ and $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ for a specific C-H pair.\n-   To find the $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})$ of the carbon directly attached to a proton with a known $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$, a 2D heteronuclear correlation experiment is required. The modern standard is the Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) experiment, which provides a 2D plot with a cross-peak at coordinates $(\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H}), \\delta(^{13}\\text{C}))$.\n-   To measure $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$, a proton-coupled spectrum is needed. Standard HSQC experiments use proton decoupling to yield sharp singlets in the carbon dimension. A \"coupled HSQC\" can be performed where this decoupling is omitted, allowing the ${^1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ coupling to be measured from the splitting of the cross-peak in the $^{13}\\text{C}$ dimension ($F_1$). Alternatively, specific pulse sequences designed to measure J-couplings can be used.\n\nTherefore, the minimal and sufficient complementary data set to resolve ambiguity consists of (1) the $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})$ of the attached carbon and (2) the corresponding $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ value, which are most efficiently obtained together from a combination of HSQC-type experiments.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. If $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ falls within overlapping windows $1.5-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (allylic/benzylic $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ versus acetylenic $\\mathrm{sp}$) or $5.0-7.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ (vinylic $\\mathrm{sp^2}$ versus aromatic $\\mathrm{sp^2}$ and hydrogen-bonded $\\mathrm{OH}/\\mathrm{NH}$), or if strong heteroatom adjacency or ring-current anisotropy is suspected, treat $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ as insufficient. Acquire Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) to obtain the directly attached carbon chemical shift $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})$, and a coupled HSQC or Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence (HMQC) variant to measure the one-bond scalar coupling $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$. Classify hybridization by the joint criteria: $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ if $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})\\leq 60\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}\\approx 120-140\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$; $\\mathrm{sp^2}$ if $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})\\approx 110-150\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}\\approx 150-180\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$; $\\mathrm{sp}$ if $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})\\approx 70-90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}\\approx 200-260\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the situations where $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ is ambiguous. It proposes acquiring precisely the two most diagnostic parameters, $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})$ and $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$, using the correct and standard experimental techniques (HSQC and its coupled variants). The listed classification criteria based on the joint values of $\\delta(^{13}\\text{C})$ and $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ are scientifically correct and provide an unambiguous assignment. The specified numerical ranges for both chemical shifts and coupling constants are accurate for their respective hybridization states. This protocol is both minimal and sufficient.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ uniquely determines hybridization, so it is always sufficient; if ambiguity arises, use only integration and multiplicity from the $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ spectrum. No complementary heteronuclear data are necessary.**\nThis option's central premise that \"$\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ uniquely determines hybridization\" is factually incorrect and contradicts the sound premise of the problem itself. For example, a benzylic proton ($-\\mathrm{CH}_2\\mathrm{Ar}$) on an $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ carbon and an acetylenic proton ($\\mathrm{-C\\equiv CH}$) on an $\\mathrm{sp}$ carbon can both appear near $\\delta = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. Integration and multiplicity from homonuclear coupling ($^{n}J_{\\text{HH}}$) cannot reliably distinguish these cases; for instance, both could be singlets.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. If $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ appears ambiguous, rely on $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$–$^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) and vicinal coupling constants $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ alone; these define hybridization because vinylic couplings are large while aliphatic are small. The minimum complementary data are a COSY spectrum and extraction of $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ values.**\nThis method is insufficient. While COSY and $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ are powerful for tracing out spin systems, they do not provide a universal solution for hybridization. A proton may not have any vicinal neighbors to couple with (e.g., an acetylenic proton in $\\mathrm{R-C\\equiv C-H}$, or a proton on a $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group), rendering this method useless. Furthermore, the ranges for $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ can overlap; a $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ for a free-rotating alkyl chain ($\\mathrm{sp^3}$) is typically $\\sim 7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is indistinguishable from a typical $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ for cis-alkene or ortho-aromatic protons ($\\mathrm{sp^2}$). This method offers no route to distinguish $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ from $\\mathrm{sp}$ protons in their region of $\\delta(^1\\mathrm{H})$ overlap.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. When $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ is inconclusive, perform Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) and assign hybridization from the pattern of Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) cross-peaks, since spatial proximity distinguishes $\\mathrm{sp^3}$, $\\mathrm{sp^2}$, and $\\mathrm{sp}$. The minimum complementary data are NOE enhancements under selective irradiation.**\nThis is a misapplication of the NOESY technique. NOESY measures through-space proximity ($ 5\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$) between nuclei. While molecular geometry is dictated by hybridization, one cannot reliably deduce hybridization from a set of inter-proton distances without significant a priori structural knowledge. NOE data is primarily used for determining stereochemistry and conformation, not fundamental bonding type. The data from HSQC and $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ measurements are far more direct and unambiguous for assigning hybridization.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Only treat $\\delta(^{1}\\mathrm{H})$ as insufficient near $2.0-3.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$; then acquire Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT) to identify $\\mathrm{CH}$, $\\mathrm{CH_2}$, and $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ types and assign hybridization from multiplicity. The minimum complementary data are DEPT-$90$ and DEPT-$135$ spectra.**\nThis option has multiple flaws. First, it wrongly narrows the ambiguity to only the $2.0-3.0\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ region, ignoring the significant overlap in the $4.5-7.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ region. Second, it fundamentally misunderstands what DEPT provides. DEPT experiments determine the number of protons attached to a carbon ($\\mathrm{CH}$, $\\mathrm{CH_2}$, or $\\mathrm{CH_3}$), not its hybridization. A $\\mathrm{CH}$ signal identified by DEPT-90 could belong to an $\\mathrm{sp}$, $\\mathrm{sp^2}$, or $\\mathrm{sp^3}$ carbon. While the carbon's chemical shift is informative, DEPT itself does not provide this information—it edits a standard $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ spectrum. Most importantly, it completely omits the single most diagnostic parameter, $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3690867"}]}
