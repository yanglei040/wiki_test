A solution will be developed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe chemical shift $\\delta$ of a resonance, expressed in parts per million (ppm), is defined as the difference between its frequency $\\nu$ and the frequency of a reference standard $\\nu_{\\text{ref}}$, normalized by the spectrometer's operating frequency $\\nu_0$, and scaled by a factor of $10^6$.\n$$\n\\delta \\text{ [in ppm]} = \\frac{\\nu - \\nu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6\n$$\nWhen considering the difference in chemical shifts, $\\Delta\\delta$, between two protons with resonance frequencies $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, the reference frequency cancels:\n$$\n\\Delta\\delta = \\delta_1 - \\delta_2 = \\left( \\frac{\\nu_1 - \\nu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\nu_0} - \\frac{\\nu_2 - \\nu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\nu_0} \\right) \\times 10^6 = \\frac{\\nu_1 - \\nu_2}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6\n$$\nLet the resonance frequency separation be $\\Delta\\nu = \\nu_1 - \\nu_2$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta\\delta = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6\n$$\nFor this equation to be dimensionally consistent, $\\Delta\\nu$ and $\\nu_0$ must be in the same units, typically hertz (Hz). The problem provides $\\nu_0$ in megahertz (MHz). We convert $\\nu_0$ from MHz to Hz: $1 \\text{ MHz} = 10^6 \\text{ Hz}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta\\delta \\text{ [in ppm]} = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu \\text{ [in Hz]}}{\\nu_0 \\text{ [in MHz]} \\times 10^6 \\text{ Hz/MHz}} \\times 10^6\n$$\nThe factors of $10^6$ cancel, leading to a simplified and practical formula:\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu \\text{ [in Hz]} = \\Delta\\delta \\text{ [in ppm]} \\times \\nu_0 \\text{ [in MHz]}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n$\\Delta\\delta = 0.20$ ppm.\n$\\nu_0 = 400$ MHz.\n$J = 12$ Hz.\n\nFirst, we calculate the resonance frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu$ in hertz.\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu = (0.20) \\times (400) = 80 \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nNext, we compute the dimensionless ratio $|\\Delta\\nu/J|$.

This condition is the prerequisite for a spin system to be considered \"weakly coupled,\" which in turn justifies the use of first-order multiplicity rules (e.g., the `$n+1$` rule) and predicts signal intensities that follow Pascal's triangle. A common rule of thumb in NMR spectroscopy is that the ratio $|\\Delta\\nu/J|$ should be greater than $10$ for the first-order approximation to hold well. A value of $|\\Delta\\nu/J| \\approx 6.67$ indicates that the system is not in the weak-coupling limit. Instead, it is in an \"intermediate coupling\" regime. While the signals will still be split into doublets, their relative intensities will deviate from the $1:1$ ratio predicted by Pascal's triangle, and their chemical shifts will be slightly perturbed from their true values. This phenomenon is known as \"second-order effects\" or \"roofing.\" Therefore, the condition $|\\Delta\\nu/J| \\gg 1$ is not strictly satisfied, and first-order rules are only a rough approximation in this case.\n\nThe final answer requested is the numerical value of the ratio.\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{J}\\right| = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.67}$$", "id": "3702158"}, {"introduction": "Once the first-order approximation is deemed valid, we can confidently predict the structure of a multiplet arising from coupling to a group of equivalent nuclei.
