This is consistent with one aromatic ring and one carbonyl.\n\nThe presence of one nitrogen and two oxygens, together with one carbonyl, suggests an amide functionality $\\mathrm{CONH_2}$ (contributing the carbonyl and the nitrogen) and one additional oxygen as a hydroxyl substituent on the ring (a phenol). Spectroscopic observations support this: IR indicates a carbonyl and a hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl, and Carbon-13 NMR shows one carbonyl carbon and six aromatic carbons, consistent with a para-disubstituted ring.

The total number of hydrogens is $7$, and the aromatic ring is para-disubstituted, which implies $4$ non-exchangeable aromatic $\\mathrm{^{1}H}$ on the ring.
