The uniform external magnetic field is applied along the $z$-axis, so $\\vec{B}_0 = B_0 \\hat{z}$. The probe proton is located on the ring axis at position $\\vec{r} = r \\hat{z}$.\n\nAccording to Lenz's law, the external magnetic field $\\vec{B}_0$ induces a current in the aromatic ring that generates its own magnetic field, $\\vec{B}_{ind}$, which opposes the change in magnetic flux. Therefore, the induced field inside the ring points in the $-\\hat{z}$ direction. This corresponds to an induced magnetic dipole moment, $\\vec{\\mu}_{ind}$, that also points in the $-\\hat{z}$ direction. The induced current is a linear response to the applied field, so the magnitude of the induced dipole moment, $\\mu_{ind}$, is directly proportional to the magnitude of the external field, $B_0$. We can write $\\vec{\\mu}_{ind} = -C B_0 \\hat{z}$, where $C$ is a positive constant of proportionality.\n\nThe magnetic field generated by a point magnetic dipole $\\vec{\\mu}$ at a distance $r$ along its axis is given by $\\vec{B}_{dipole} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\vec{\\mu}}{r^3}$ (in the far-field approximation).
