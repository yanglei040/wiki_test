Internal referencing (for example, lock-mass correction) continuously constrains the mass scale using an internal ion of known mass, while external referencing (for example, a polynomial calibration from a standard mixture) provides a separate reference relation between instrument observables and mass. Regardless of whether internal or external referencing is employed, uncertainty analysis compares a measured value to a reference value via absolute and relative errors.
