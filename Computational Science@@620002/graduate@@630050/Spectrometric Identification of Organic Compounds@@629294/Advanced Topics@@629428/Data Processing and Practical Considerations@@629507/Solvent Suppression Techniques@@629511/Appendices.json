The solution is derived from the fundamental principles of spin dynamics in the rotating frame, as defined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we analyze the calibration experiment. An on-resonance nutation experiment using a continuous radiofrequency field of constant amplitude, which we will denote as $B_{1,\\text{current}}$, is performed. The problem states that the transverse signal response varies as $\\sin(\\gamma B_{1} t)$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $t$ is the pulse duration. The observed fundamental period of this oscillation, $T_{\\text{obs}}$, corresponds to the time required for the flip angle, $\\theta(t) = \\gamma B_{1,\\text{current}} t$, to advance by a full cycle of $2\\pi$ radians. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\gamma B_{1,\\text{current}} T_{\\text{obs}} = 2\\pi $$\nFrom this, we can express the current RF field amplitude in terms of the measured period $T_{\\text{obs}}$ and the constant $\\gamma$. This constitutes the inference of the current effective $B_{1}$ amplitude:\n$$ B_{1,\\text{current}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma T_{\\text{obs}}} $$\nNext, we consider the frequency-selective shaped pulse. This pulse has a duration $t_{p}$, a peak amplitude $B_{1,\\max}$, and a shape area factor $\\kappa$. The flip angle it produces is given by the formula $\\theta = \\gamma \\kappa B_{1,\\max} t_{p}$. The problem setup implies that the power setting used for the calibration experiment is the same as the one intended for the shaped pulse, meaning the peak amplitude of the shaped pulse is equal to the amplitude of the calibration field, i.e., $B_{1,\\max} = B_{1,\\text{current}}$. We can therefore calculate the actual flip angle, $\\theta_{\\text{act}}$, that this pulse would produce with the current uncorrected settings. We substitute the expression for $B_{1,\\text{current}}$ into the formula for the shaped pulse flip angle:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{act}} = \\gamma \\kappa B_{1, \\text{current}} t_p = \\gamma \\kappa \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma T_{\\text{obs}}} \\right) t_p $$\nThe gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ cancels, simplifying the expression for the actual flip angle:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{act}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\kappa t_p}{T_{\\text{obs}}} $$\nUsing the given values $t_p = 20.0 \\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $T_{\\text{obs}} = 6.80 \\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\kappa = 0.40$:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{act}} = \\frac{2\\pi (0.40)(20.0)}{6.80} \\approx 7.39198 \\,\\text{radians} $$\nThe desired flip angle is $\\theta_{\\text{des}} = \\pi/2$ radians. The flip angle error, $\\Delta \\theta$, is the difference between the actual and desired angles:\n$$ \\Delta \\theta = \\theta_{\\text{act}} - \\theta_{\\text{des}} \\approx 7.39198 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx 7.39198 - 1.57080 \\approx 5.82118 \\,\\text{radians} $$\nThis large positive error indicates that the current transmitter amplitude is significantly higher than required. To achieve the desired flip angle $\\theta_{\\text{des}}$, we must adjust the RF field amplitude. Let the new peak amplitude be $B_{1,\\text{new}}$, which is related to the current amplitude by a multiplicative scaling factor $s$, such that $B_{1,\\text{new}} = s \\cdot B_{1,\\text{current}}$. The condition for the desired flip angle is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{des}} = \\gamma \\kappa B_{1,\\text{new}} t_p $$\nSubstituting for $B_{1, \\text{new}}$:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{des}} = \\gamma \\kappa (s \\cdot B_{1,\\text{current}}) t_p = s \\cdot (\\gamma \\kappa B_{1,\\text{current}} t_p) $$\nThe term in parentheses is precisely the actual flip angle, $\\theta_{\\text{act}}$. Thus, we have the simple relation:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{des}} = s \\cdot \\theta_{\\text{act}} $$\nSolving for the scaling factor $s$:\n$$ s = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{des}}}{\\theta_{\\text{act}}} $$\nSubstituting the symbolic expressions for $\\theta_{\\text{des}}$ and $\\theta_{\\text{act}}$:\n$$ s = \\frac{\\pi/2}{\\frac{2\\pi \\kappa t_p}{T_{\\text{obs}}}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot \\frac{T_{\\text{obs}}}{2\\pi \\kappa t_p} $$\nThe factor of $\\pi$ cancels, yielding the final expression for the scaling factor:\n$$ s = \\frac{T_{\\text{obs}}}{4 \\kappa t_p} $$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for $s$ using the given parameters: $T_{\\text{obs}} = 6.80 \\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $t_p = 20.0 \\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\kappa = 0.40$. The time units cancel.\n$$ s = \\frac{6.80}{4 \\times 0.40 \\times 20.0} = \\frac{6.80}{32.0} = 0.2125 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to four significant figures.
