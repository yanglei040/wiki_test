The provided information is self-contained and consistent, based on established physical principles (Larmor precession, chemical shift, Bloch-McConnell equations) and realistic experimental parameters. There are no violations of scientific or mathematical logic. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for three things: first, a derivation of the scaling of the exchange-induced transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$, with the static magnetic field, $B_0$; second, the calculation of the specific scaling factor between experiments at $400$ MHz and $800$ MHz; and third, a justification for why Chemical Shift Anisotropy (CSA) can confound this analysis.\n\n**1. Scaling of $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ with the Static Magnetic Field ($B_0$)**\n\nWe begin from fundamental principles as requested.\n\nThe Larmor precession frequency, $\\omega_0$, of a nuclear spin in a static magnetic field of strength $B_0$ is given by:\n$$ \\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0 $$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant for a given nucleus (in this case, a proton). The spectrometer's operating frequency, such as $400$ MHz or $800$ MHz, is $\\nu_0 = \\omega_0 / (2\\pi)$, and is therefore directly proportional to $B_0$.\n\nChemical shift, $\\delta$, is a dimensionless quantity expressed in parts per million (ppm) that quantifies the difference in resonance frequency of a nucleus compared to a reference. The actual frequency difference, $\\Delta\\Omega$, in angular frequency units (rad/s), between two states with a chemical shift offset of $\\Delta\\delta$ is dependent on the Larmor frequency:\n$$ \\Delta\\Omega = \\Delta\\delta \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\omega_0 $$\nSince $\\omega_0 \\propto B_0$, it follows directly that the frequency separation between the two exchanging sites is proportional to the static magnetic field strength:\n$$ \\Delta\\Omega \\propto B_0 $$\n\nNext, we consider the two-site Bloch–McConnell exchange framework. In a transverse relaxation dispersion experiment like Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG), the exchange process between two sites with different chemical shifts contributes to the transverse relaxation rate. This exchange contribution is denoted $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$. The magnitude of this contribution is fundamentally dependent on the populations of the two states, $p_A$ and $p_B$, the total rate of exchange, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_{AB} + k_{BA}$, and the square of the frequency separation, $(\\Delta\\Omega)^2$.\n\nA widely used expression for the amplitude of the relaxation dispersion, which quantifies the magnitude of $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$, is proportional to the term $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}$:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}} = p_A p_B (\\Delta\\Omega)^2 $$\nDifferent analytical approximations of the Bloch-McConnell equations for $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ in various exchange regimes (fast, intermediate, slow) all show this dependence on $(\\Delta\\Omega)^2$. For example, in the fast-exchange limit ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\gg \\Delta\\Omega$), the exchange contribution is given by:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx \\frac{p_A p_B (\\Delta\\Omega)^2}{k_{\\mathrm{ex}}} $$\nThe problem states that the exchange kinetics (populations $p_A$, $p_B$ and rate constants, which determine $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$) are independent of the magnetic field. Therefore, $p_A$, $p_B$, and $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ are constants with respect to $B_0$.\n\nCombining these facts, the field dependence of $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ is determined solely by the $(\\Delta\\Omega)^2$ term:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto (\\Delta\\Omega)^2 $$\nSince we established that $\\Delta\\Omega \\propto B_0$, we can conclude that the exchange-induced transverse relaxation rate scales with the square of the static magnetic field strength:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto B_0^2 $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Scaling Factor**\n\nWe are asked to compute the multiplicative scaling factor of $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ when increasing the spectrometer frequency from $400$ MHz to $800$ MHz. Let $\\nu_{0,1} = 400$ MHz and $\\nu_{0,2} = 800$ MHz be the two Larmor frequencies. As established, the spectrometer frequency $\\nu_0$ is directly proportional to the static field strength $B_0$.\n\nUsing the derived scaling relationship, $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto B_0^2$, and the fact that $B_0 \\propto \\nu_0$, we have:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto \\nu_0^2 $$\nThe ratio of the exchange contributions at the two fields is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(800\\ \\mathrm{MHz})}{R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(400\\ \\mathrm{MHz})} = \\frac{k \\cdot (\\nu_{0,2})^2}{k \\cdot (\\nu_{0,1})^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu_{0,2}}{\\nu_{0,1}}\\right)^2 $$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\frac{R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(800\\ \\mathrm{MHz})}{R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(400\\ \\mathrm{MHz})} = \\left(\\frac{800\\ \\mathrm{MHz}}{400\\ \\mathrm{MHz}}\\right)^2 = (2)^2 = 4 $$\nThe chemical shift offset $\\Delta\\delta = 0.2$ ppm is consistent with a typical NMR experiment but is not required for calculating this ratio, as it is a field-independent constant that would cancel out. The expected multiplicative scaling factor is exactly $4$.\n\n**3. Confounding Effect of Chemical Shift Anisotropy (CSA)**\n\nChemical Shift Anisotropy (CSA) is the dependence of a nucleus's chemical shift on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external magnetic field $B_0$. For an isotropically tumbling molecule, this effect is averaged out, resulting in a single isotropic chemical shift. However, the motional fluctuations of the orientation-dependent chemical shift provide a powerful mechanism for nuclear spin relaxation.\n\nThe contribution of CSA to the transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}}$, is given by the expression:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}} = C \\cdot (\\gamma B_0)^2 (\\Delta\\sigma)^2 f(\\tau_c, \\omega_0) $$\nwhere $C$ is a numerical constant, $\\Delta\\sigma$ is the anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor, $\\tau_c$ is the rotational correlation time, and $f(\\tau_c, \\omega_0)$ is a spectral density function. The crucial point is the explicit dependence on the square of the magnetic field, $B_0^2$, because $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0$. For a small molecule where $\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\ll 1$, the spectral density function is nearly constant, and the relationship simplifies to:\n$$ R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}} \\propto B_0^2 $$\nThe total observed transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the sum of all contributing mechanisms. In the context of this problem, it includes at least an intrinsic component $R_{2,\\mathrm{int}}$ and the exchange component $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$. The intrinsic rate itself is a sum of terms, including the CSA contribution: $R_{2,\\mathrm{int}} = R_{2,\\mathrm{other}} + R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}}$.\nThe total apparent relaxation rate is $R_2(\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}) = R_{2,\\mathrm{int}} + R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}})$.\n\nThe confounding effect arises because both the exchange contribution ($R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$) and the CSA relaxation contribution ($R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}}$) have the same quadratic dependence on the static magnetic field strength ($B_0^2$). When analyzing experimental data from multiple magnetic fields, an increase in the observed relaxation rate with $B_0^2$ could be due to either $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ or $R_{2,\\mathrm{CSA}}$, or a combination of both. If the presence of CSA relaxation is not acknowledged and explicitly included in the data fitting model, its contribution to the relaxation will be incorrectly attributed to the chemical exchange process. This would lead to erroneous estimates of the exchange parameters, particularly the chemical shift difference $\\Delta\\Omega$, and would corrupt the verification of the $B_0^2$ scaling law for the exchange process itself. Therefore, the presence of a second, physically distinct relaxation mechanism with the same field dependence confounds the unambiguous experimental determination of the scaling for $R_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}$ alone.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "3721019"}, {"introduction": "Observing a curved relaxation dispersion profile is strong evidence for an underlying dynamic process, but rigorous science demands statistical justification.

There is a minor terminological inconsistency: the \"weighted residual sum of squares\" is given with units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. A true weighted sum of squares, $\\chi^2 = \\sum_i (y_i - f(x_i))^2 / \\sigma_i^2$, would be dimensionless since $\\sigma_i^2$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. The provided $\\mathrm{RSS}$ values must therefore represent the unweighted sum of squared residuals, $\\mathrm{SSR} = \\sum_i (y_i - f(x_i))^2$. This is a minor terminological flaw but does not invalidate the problem, as the physical meaning of the quantity is clear from its units.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not exhibit any other flaws from the checklist. It is a standard problem in data analysis for chemical physics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The minor terminological issue regarding \"weighted RSS\" is resolved by interpreting the quantity based on its provided units. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to compare two nested statistical models. The null model $H_0$ (no exchange) is a special case of the alternative model $H_1$ (two-site exchange). The model $H_0$ has $k_0 = 1$ parameter, and model $H_1$ has $k_1 = 4$ parameters. The number of data points is $n = 8$.\n\nA critical piece of information is that the standard deviation of the measurement errors is known: $\\sigma = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. When the error variance is known, the most powerful and appropriate statistical test for comparing nested models is the likelihood-ratio test (LRT).\n\nFor data with independent Gaussian errors of known variance $\\sigma^2$, the log-likelihood function is given by $\\ln \\mathcal{L} = C - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i - f(x_i))^2}{\\sigma^2}$, where $C$ is a constant. The quantity $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i - f(x_i))^2}{\\sigma^2}$ is the chi-squared statistic, $\\chi^2$. As established in the validation, the provided $\\mathrm{RSS}$ values are the sum of squared residuals, $\\mathrm{SSR} = \\sum (y_i - f(x_i))^2$. Thus, we can write $\\chi^2 = \\mathrm{SSR} / \\sigma^2$.\n\nThe LRT statistic is given by $\\Delta \\chi^2 = \\chi_0^2 - \\chi_1^2$, where $\\chi_0^2$ and $\\chi_1^2$ are the chi-squared values for the best fits under models $H_0$ and $H_1$, respectively.\n$$\n\\Delta \\chi^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{SSR}_0}{\\sigma^2} - \\frac{\\mathrm{SSR}_1}{\\sigma^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SSR}_0 - \\mathrm{SSR}_1}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\nAccording to Wilks' theorem, under the null hypothesis, this $\\Delta \\chi^2$ statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with a number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models, $\\Delta k = k_1 - k_0$.\n\nLet's calculate the values for this problem:\n- $\\mathrm{SSR}_0 = 11.92\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n- $\\mathrm{SSR}_1 = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n- $\\sigma^2 = (0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^2 = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n- $\\Delta k = k_1 - k_0 = 4 - 1 = 3$\n\nThe test statistic is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\chi^2 = \\frac{11.92\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2} - 0.36\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{0.04\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}} = \\frac{11.56}{0.04} = 289\n$$\nWe must compare this value to the critical value of the chi-squared distribution with $3$ degrees of freedom at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. The $0.95$ quantile is $\\chi^2_{3, 0.95} = 7.815$.\n\nSince our test statistic $\\Delta \\chi^2 = 289$ is vastly greater than the critical value of $7.815$, the p-value is extremely small ($p \\ll 0.001$). We therefore strongly reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ and conclude that the data provide significant evidence for the two-state exchange model $H_1$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use the nested-model $F$-test appropriate when the error variance is estimated from the data: compute $F = \\frac{(\\mathrm{RSS}_0 - \\mathrm{RSS}_1)/(k_1 - k_0)}{\\mathrm{RSS}_1/(n - k_1)} = \\frac{(11.92 - 0.36)/3}{0.36/4} \\approx 42.8$, compare to the $F$-distribution with $(3, 4)$ degrees of freedom, find $p < 0.01$, reject $H_0$ at $\\alpha = 0.05$, and conclude that the two-state exchange model is supported.**\n\nThis option proposes an F-test. The F-test is the standard procedure for comparing nested models when the error variance $\\sigma^2$ is *unknown* and must be estimated from the data. The denominator of the F-statistic, $\\mathrm{SSR}_1 / (n - k_1)$, serves as this estimate. Since the problem explicitly provides a known $\\sigma$, using the F-test is not the most powerful or theoretically ideal method; it discards the given information about $\\sigma$. However, the F-test is a valid statistical test in its own right and is often used pragmatically.\n\nLet's check the execution of the test as described:\n- The formula is correct for the F-test.\n- The degrees of freedom are correctly identified as $\\nu_1 = k_1 - k_0 = 3$ and $\\nu_2 = n - k_1 = 8 - 4 = 4$.\n- The calculation is correct: $F = \\frac{(11.92 - 0.36)/3}{0.36/4} = \\frac{11.56/3}{0.09} \\approx \\frac{3.853}{0.09} \\approx 42.8$.\n- The critical value for an F-distribution with $(3, 4)$ degrees of freedom at $\\alpha = 0.05$ is $F_{3,4,0.05} = 6.59$.\n- Since $42.8 \\gg 6.59$, the conclusion to reject $H_0$ is correct.\n\nThe option presents a self-consistent and correctly executed statistical procedure. Although the choice of test is suboptimal given the problem's premises, the description of the test and its execution contains no errors.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) for Gaussian residuals and conclude that the single-state model is favored because the penalty for $k_1 = 4$ outweighs the improvement in $\\mathrm{RSS}$, yielding $\\Delta \\mathrm{AICc} \\approx +8$ in favor of $H_0$.**\n\nAICc is a tool for model selection, not formal hypothesis testing. The model with the lower AICc value is preferred. The formula is $\\mathrm{AICc} = n \\ln(\\mathrm{SSR}/n) + 2k + \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1}$.\n- For $H_0$: $k_0 = 1$, $\\mathrm{SSR}_0 = 11.92$.\n  $\\mathrm{AICc}_0 = 8 \\ln(11.92/8) + 2(1) + \\frac{2(1)(2)}{8-1-1} = 8 \\ln(1.49) + 2 + 4/6 \\approx 3.19 + 2 + 0.67 = 5.86$.\n- For $H_1$: $k_1 = 4$, $\\mathrm{SSR}_1 = 0.36$.\n  $\\mathrm{AICc}_1 = 8 \\ln(0.36/8) + 2(4) + \\frac{2(4)(5)}{8-4-1} = 8 \\ln(0.045) + 8 + 40/3 \\approx 8(-3.10) + 8 + 13.33 = -24.81 + 21.33 = -3.48$.\n\nThe AICc for model $H_1$ is significantly lower than for model $H_0$. This indicates strong support for the more complex model, $H_1$. The option incorrectly concludes that the single-state model ($H_0$) is favored.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Fit a straight line to $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$ versus $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$; since the slope is significantly negative at $\\alpha = 0.05$, conclude that the two-state model is supported.**\n\nThis approach is statistically naive and physically unmotivated. The relationship between $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ predicted by the Bloch-McConnell equations is highly non-linear. Fitting a straight line ignores the known physics of the system. While a negative slope might qualitatively suggest that $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$ is not constant, this method is not a rigorous test for comparing the specific, physically-derived models $H_0$ and $H_1$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use a likelihood-ratio $\\chi^2$ test with $\\Delta \\chi^2 = (\\mathrm{RSS}_0 - \\mathrm{RSS}_1)/\\sigma^2 \\approx 289$ compared to a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom, which far exceeds the $0.95$ quantile, thereby rejecting $H_0$ and accepting the two-state model.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the most appropriate test (LRT $\\chi^2$ test) and correctly calculates the test statistic value of $289$. However, it makes a critical error in stating the number of degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom for the comparison of these two nested models must be the difference in the number of free parameters, $\\Delta k = k_1 - k_0 = 4 - 1 = 3$. The option incorrectly states that the comparison should be made to a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom. This is a fundamental error in the formulation of the hypothesis test. Although the ultimate conclusion to reject $H_0$ happens to be correct (as $289$ would exceed the critical value for any reasonable degrees of freedom), the reasoning provided is flawed.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOption A describes a valid statistical procedure (the F-test) and executes it without any errors in calculation or logic. While the F-test is not the most powerful test available because it ignores the known error variance, it is a standard and robust method for model comparison. Option D chooses the theoretically superior test but makes a definitive error in specifying its parameters (degrees of freedom). Options B and C are demonstrably wrong. Between A and D, option A presents a completely correct, self-contained line of reasoning, even if it is based on a suboptimal choice of test. Option D, in contrast, contains a factual error in its reasoning. Therefore, option A is the best choice among the given options.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3721068"}]}
