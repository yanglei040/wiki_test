We shall proceed in this logical order.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principles. The resonance frequency $\\nu$ of a nucleus with magnetogyric ratio $\\gamma$ in a magnetic field of strength $B$ is given by the Larmor equation:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{\\gamma B}{2\\pi}\n$$\nIn a molecule, the external magnetic field $B_0$ induces electronic currents that create a secondary magnetic field at the nucleus. This effect, known as nuclear shielding, is described by the absolute shielding constant $\\sigma$. The effective magnetic field experienced by the nucleus, $B_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is thus modulated:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1 - \\sigma) B_0\n$$\nConsequently, the resonance frequency of a nucleus $X$ in a sample molecule is given by:\n$$\n\\nu_X = \\frac{\\gamma_X B_{\\mathrm{eff},X}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\gamma_X (1 - \\sigma_X) B_0}{2\\pi}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_X$ is the absolute shielding constant for nucleus $X$ in the sample.\n\nSimilarly, for the same nucleus $X$ in a reference compound (e.g., tetramethylsilane, TMS), under the identical external field $B_0$, the resonance frequency is:\n$$\n\\nu_X^{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{\\gamma_X B_{\\mathrm{eff},X}^{\\mathrm{ref}}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\gamma_X (1 - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}) B_0}{2\\pi}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the absolute shielding constant of the nucleus in the reference compound. The magnetogyric ratio $\\gamma_X$ is an intrinsic property of the nuclide (in this case, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$) and is identical for both the sample and the reference.\n\nThe chemical shift, $\\delta_X$, is defined as the difference in resonance frequencies relative to the reference frequency, expressed in parts per million (ppm):\n$$\n\\delta_X = \\frac{\\nu_X - \\nu_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\nu_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\times 10^6\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\nu_X$ and $\\nu_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}$ into this definition, we obtain:\n$$\n\\delta_X = \\frac{\\frac{\\gamma_X (1 - \\sigma_X) B_0}{2\\pi} - \\frac{\\gamma_X (1 - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}) B_0}{2\\pi}}{\\frac{\\gamma_X (1 - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}) B_0}{2\\pi}} \\times 10^6\n$$\nThe common factor of $\\frac{\\gamma_X B_0}{2\\pi}$ can be cancelled from the numerator and the denominator, which demonstrates that the chemical shift is independent of the magnetogyric ratio and the strength of the external magnetic field. This simplifies the expression to:\n$$\n\\delta_X = \\frac{(1 - \\sigma_X) - (1 - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}})}{1 - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\times 10^6\n$$\nFurther simplification of the numerator yields the desired relation:\n$$\n\\delta_X = \\frac{\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\sigma_X}{1 - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\times 10^6\n$$\nThis is the exact expression relating the chemical shift to the absolute shielding constants. It is often noted that since shielding constants $\\sigma$ are typically very small (on the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-4}$), the denominator $1 - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is very close to $1$. This allows for a common approximation $\\delta_X \\approx (\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\sigma_X) \\times 10^6$. However, for exacting work, the full expression should be used.\n\nNext, we evaluate the chemical shift for the given case.\nThe provided data are:\n- Nucleus: $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$\n- Sample absolute shielding: $\\sigma_{X} = 1.55347 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- Reference absolute shielding (TMS): $\\sigma_{X}^{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.82396 \\times 10^{-4}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived exact formula:\n$$\n\\delta_{X} = \\frac{(1.82396 \\times 10^{-4}) - (1.55347 \\times 10^{-4})}{1 - (1.82396 \\times 10^{-4})} \\times 10^6\n$$\nThe difference in the numerator is:\n$$\n\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\sigma_X = 0.27049 \\times 10^{-4} = 2.7049 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\n1 - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1 - 0.000182396 = 0.999817604\n$$\nThus, the chemical shift is:\n$$\n\\delta_X = \\frac{2.7049 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.999817604} \\times 10^6 = 27.05391...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\delta_X \\approx 27.05 \\text{ ppm}\n$$\n\nFinally, we address the conceptual question: why it is necessary to compute $\\sigma_{X}^{\\mathrm{ref}}$ at the same level of theory as $\\sigma_{X}$.\nA \"level of theory\" in quantum chemical calculations represents a specific combination of an electronic structure method (e.g., Hartree-Fock, DFT with a specific functional) and a basis set, along with other parameters like the treatment of solvent or relativistic effects. Any such choice is an approximation to the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation and introduces systematic errors. Key sources of error include the approximate treatment of electron correlation (method error) and the finite size of the basis set (basis set error).\nThe calculation of absolute magnetic shielding constants is highly sensitive to these errors, and as a result, the computed absolute value, $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{calc}}$, can deviate significantly from the true physical value, $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{true}}$. This discrepancy, $\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma^{\\mathrm{calc}} - \\sigma^{\\mathrm{true}}$, is the systematic error of the calculation.\n\nChemical shift, $\\delta_X$, is a relative quantity, depending on the *difference* between two shielding constants: $\\delta_X \\propto (\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\sigma_X)$. When both $\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and $\\sigma_X$ are computed at the exact same level of theory, it is assumed that the systematic error $\\Delta\\sigma$ is very similar for both the reference and the sample molecules, i.e., $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\approx \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}}$. This assumption is particularly valid if the chemical environments of the nuclei under study are reasonably similar.\nThe calculated chemical shift is thus:\n$$\n\\delta_X^{\\mathrm{calc}} \\propto (\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref, calc}} - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{calc}}) = (\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref, true}} + \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}) - (\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{sample, true}} + \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}})\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_X^{\\mathrm{calc}} \\propto (\\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{ref, true}} - \\sigma_X^{\\mathrm{sample, true}}) + (\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}})\n$$\nSince $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\approx \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}}$, the error difference $(\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}})$ becomes very small. This phenomenon is known as **cancellation of errors**. Due to this cancellation, the computed chemical shift $\\delta_X^{\\mathrm{calc}}$ is much more accurate and reliable than the underlying absolute shielding values from which it is derived.\nIf one were to use different levels of theory for the sample and the reference, the systematic errors $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sample}}$ would be different and uncorrelated. The cancellation of errors would be lost, rendering the final calculated chemical shift value arbitrary and physically meaningless. Therefore, the consistent application of the same computational protocol (method, basis set, GIAO formalism, etc.) for both the molecule of interest and its reference is a non-negotiable requirement for the valid prediction of NMR chemical shifts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{27.05}$$", "id": "3697488"}, {"introduction": "Many organic molecules are conformationally flexible, and their NMR spectra often reflect a time-averaged picture of multiple interconverting structures rather than a single static one.

Suppose a single proton site exists in two interconverting conformers with equilibrium populations $p_A$ and $p_B$ (with $p_A + p_B = 1$) and forward and backward first-order rate constants $k_{AB}$ and $k_{BA}$. Computational chemistry at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level provides isotropic shieldings that are converted to site-specific chemical shifts $\\delta_A$ and $\\delta_B$ (in parts per million relative to the same reference), and the spectrometer operates at a static field corresponding to proton frequency $\\nu_0$. In the rotating frame at the reference frequency, denote the complex transverse magnetizations immediately after a hard pulse as $M_A(t)$ and $M_B(t)$.

From these dynamics, obtain a closed-form analytic expression for the observed chemical shift $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ in terms of $p_A$, $p_B$, $\\delta_A$, and $\\delta_B$.

The dynamics of each magnetization component is influenced by its intrinsic precession and relaxation, as well as by the loss of magnetization to the other site and gain of magnetization from the other site. The intrinsic evolution for an isolated site $j$ is given by $\\frac{d}{dt} M_j(t) = -\\left(R_{2,j} + i \\,\\Delta \\omega_j\\right) M_j(t)$. To this, we add terms for the first-order kinetic exchange process $A \\rightleftharpoons B$. The rate of magnetization loss from site $A$ is $k_{AB}M_A(t)$, and the rate of gain from site $B$ is $k_{BA}M_B(t)$. A similar logic applies to site $B$. This leads to the coupled Bloch–McConnell equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_A(t)}{dt} = -\\left(R_{2,A} + i \\,\\Delta \\omega_A\\right) M_A(t) - k_{AB} M_A(t) + k_{BA} M_B(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM_B(t)}{dt} = -\\left(R_{2,B} + i \\,\\Delta \\omega_B\\right) M_B(t) - k_{BA} M_B(t) + k_{AB} M_A(t)\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the principle of detailed balance requires that the flux between the two states is equal, which means $p_A k_{AB} = p_B k_{BA}$, where $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the equilibrium populations.\n\nThe goal is to derive the dynamics for the total observable transverse magnetization, $M_T(t) = M_A(t) + M_B(t)$. We begin by summing the two differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_T(t)}{dt} = \\frac{dM_A(t)}{dt} + \\frac{dM_B(t)}{dt}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM_T(t)}{dt} = \\left[-\\left(R_{2,A} + i \\,\\Delta \\omega_A\\right) M_A(t) - k_{AB} M_A(t) + k_{BA} M_B(t)\\right] + \\left[-\\left(R_{2,B} + i \\,\\Delta \\omega_B\\right) M_B(t) - k_{BA} M_B(t) + k_{AB} M_A(t)\\right]\n$$\nThe exchange terms cancel out in the sum:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_T(t)}{dt} = -\\left(R_{2,A} + i \\,\\Delta \\omega_A\\right) M_A(t) - \\left(R_{2,B} + i \\,\\Delta \\omega_B\\right) M_B(t)\n$$\nThis equation still depends on the individual magnetizations $M_A(t)$ and $M_B(t)$. To simplify this, we invoke the fast-exchange limit, where the total exchange rate is much larger than the differences in intrinsic precession frequencies and relaxation rates: $k_{AB} + k_{BA} \\gg \\left| \\Delta \\omega_A - \\Delta \\omega_B \\right|$ and $k_{AB} + k_{BA} \\gg \\left| R_{2,A} - R_{2,B} \\right|$. In this regime, the exchange process is so rapid that the system effectively forgets which site a given spin is at on the timescale of its precession. Any deviation from the equilibrium distribution of magnetization between the two sites decays extremely quickly (on a timescale of $(k_{AB} + k_{BA})^{-1}$). Therefore, a quasi-equilibrium is maintained, where the magnetizations of the two sites are continuously re-equilibrated to be proportional to their respective equilibrium populations.
