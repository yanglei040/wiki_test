A solution will be derived based on the principles of exciton coupling theory.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe phenomenon of exciton coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) arises from the interaction between two or more chromophores. For a system of two identical chromophores, the degenerate monomer excited states split into two exciton states due to the interaction. These states are symmetric ($\\Psi_+$) and antisymmetric ($\\Psi_-$) combinations of the localized monomer excitations.\n\nThe energy of interaction between the two transition dipole moments, within the point-dipole approximation, is given by $V_{12}$:\n$$V_{12} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}|^2}{r^3} \\left[ (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2) - 3 (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12})(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}) \\right]$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2$ are unit vectors along the transition dipole moments, $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}$ is the unit vector along the interchromophore displacement vector $\\mathbf{r}_{12}$, $r$ is the distance between the chromophores, and $|\\boldsymbol{\\mu}|$ is the magnitude of the transition dipole moment. The sign of $V_{12}$ is determined by the geometric factor $K$:\n$$K = (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2) - 3 (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12})(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12})$$\nThe energy levels of the exciton states are split by $2V_{12}$.\n- If $V_{12} < 0$ (attractive interaction), the symmetric state $\\Psi_+$ is lower in energy.\n- If $V_{12} > 0$ (repulsive interaction), the antisymmetric state $\\Psi_-$ is lower in energy.\n\nThe long-wavelength band in the CD spectrum corresponds to the transition to the lower-energy exciton state.\n\nThe rotational strengths of the two exciton bands, $R_+$ and $R_-$, are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign ($R_+ = -R_-$). They are non-zero only if the chromophore arrangement is chiral. The sign of the rotational strength for the symmetric state, $R_+$, is determined by the sign of the scalar triple product of the three vectors defining the geometry:\n$$R_+ \\propto \\mathbf{r}_{12} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_1 \\times \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_2)$$\nA positive rotational strength corresponds to a positive CD band (a positive Cotton effect). Let the helicity term be $\\mathcal{H} = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12} \\cdot (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\times \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2)$, so that $\\text{sign}(R_+) = \\text{sign}(\\mathcal{H})$.\n\nThe sign of the long-wavelength band is the sign of the rotational strength of the lower-energy exciton state.\n- If $V_{12} < 0$, the low-energy state is $\\Psi_+$. The sign of the long-wavelength band is $\\text{sign}(R_+) = \\text{sign}(\\mathcal{H})$.\n- If $V_{12} > 0$, the low-energy state is $\\Psi_-$. The sign of the long-wavelength band is $\\text{sign}(R_-) = \\text{sign}(-R_+) = -\\text{sign}(\\mathcal{H})$.\n\nThis can be summarized: Sign of long-$\\lambda$ band $= -\\text{sign}(V_{12}) \\times \\text{sign}(R_+)$.\n\nFirst, we express the unit vectors in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ using the standard transformation from spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$: $x = r \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi$, $y = r \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi$, $z = r \\cos\\theta$. Since we have unit vectors, $r=1$.\n\nThe interchromophore vector is $\\mathbf{r}_{12} = r\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, so the unit vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n\nFor $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1$ with $\\theta_1 = 40^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi_1 = 0^{\\circ}$:\n$$x_1 = \\sin(40^{\\circ})\\cos(0^{\\circ}) = \\sin(40^{\\circ})$$\n$$y_1 = \\sin(40^{\\circ})\\sin(0^{\\circ}) = 0$$\n$$z_1 = \\cos(40^{\\circ})$$\n$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 = (\\sin(40^{\\circ}), 0, \\cos(40^{\\circ}))$$\n\nFor $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2$ with $\\theta_2 = 55^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi_2 = 65^{\\circ}$:\n$$x_2 = \\sin(55^{\\circ})\\cos(65^{\\circ})$$\n$$y_2 = \\sin(55^{\\circ})\\sin(65^{\\circ})$$\n$$z_2 = \\cos(55^{\\circ})$$\n$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2 = (\\sin(55^{\\circ})\\cos(65^{\\circ}), \\sin(55^{\\circ})\\sin(65^{\\circ}), \\cos(55^{\\circ}))$$\n\nNext, we determine the sign of the interaction energy $V_{12}$ by evaluating the sign of the geometric factor $K$:\n$$K = (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2) - 3 (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12})(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12})$$\nThe dot products are:\n$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12} = z_1 = \\cos(40^{\\circ})$$\n$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12} = z_2 = \\cos(55^{\\circ})$$\n$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2 = x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 + z_1 z_2 = \\sin(40^{\\circ})\\sin(55^{\\circ})\\cos(65^{\\circ}) + 0 + \\cos(40^{\\circ})\\cos(55^{\\circ})$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $K$:\n$$K = [\\sin(40^{\\circ})\\sin(55^{\\circ})\\cos(65^{\\circ}) + \\cos(40^{\\circ})\\cos(55^{\\circ})] - 3(\\cos(40^{\\circ}))(\\cos(55^{\\circ}))$$\n$$K = \\sin(40^{\\circ})\\sin(55^{\\circ})\\cos(65^{\\circ}) - 2\\cos(40^{\\circ})\\cos(55^{\\circ})$$\nThe angles $40^{\\circ}$, $55^{\\circ}$, and $65^{\\circ}$ are all in the first quadrant, so all their sines and cosines are positive.\nThe first term, $\\sin(40^{\\circ})\\sin(55^{\\circ})\\cos(65^{\\circ})$, is positive.\nThe second term, $2\\cos(40^{\\circ})\\cos(55^{\\circ})$, is also positive.\nTo determine the sign of $K$, we compare their magnitudes. Using approximate values:\n$\\sin(40^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.643$, $\\cos(40^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.766$\n$\\sin(55^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.819$, $\\cos(55^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.574$\n$\\cos(65^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.423$\nTerm $1 \\approx (0.643)(0.819)(0.423) \\approx 0.222$\nTerm $2 \\approx 2(0.766)(0.574) \\approx 0.879$\nSo, $K \\approx 0.222 - 0.879 = -0.657$.\nSince $K < 0$, the interaction energy $V_{12}$ is negative. This corresponds to an attractive interaction, and the symmetric state $\\Psi_+$ is lower in energy.\n\nNow, we determine the sign of the rotational strength $R_+$ by evaluating the sign of the helicity term $\\mathcal{H}$:\n$$\\mathcal{H} = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12} \\cdot (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\times \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2)$$\nSince $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12} = (0, 0, 1)$, $\\mathcal{H}$ is simply the $z$-component of the cross product $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\times \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2$.\n$$(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_1 \\times \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_2)_z = x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2$$\n$$\\mathcal{H} = (\\sin(40^{\\circ}))(\\sin(55^{\\circ})\\sin(65^{\\circ})) - (0)(\\sin(55^{\\circ})\\cos(65^{\\circ}))$$\n$$\\mathcal{H} = \\sin(40^{\\circ})\\sin(55^{\\circ})\\sin(65^{\\circ})$$\nSince the angles $40^{\\circ}$, $55^{\\circ}$, and $65^{\\circ}$ are all in the first quadrant $(0, 90^{\\circ})$, their sine values are all positive. The product of three positive numbers is positive.\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{H} > 0$, which means $R_+ > 0$.\n\nFinally, we determine the sign of the long-wavelength band. Since $V_{12} < 0$, the lower-energy state is $\\Psi_+$, which corresponds to the long-wavelength band. The sign of this band is the sign of $R_+$. As we found that $R_+ > 0$, the long-wavelength band is positive. The required output is $+1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3701567"}, {"introduction": "A complete spectral prediction requires more than just determining the sign of the CD bands; it also demands an understanding of their relative intensities.

It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters are physically realistic. The potential ambiguity of \"identical monomers\" with non-identical oscillator strengths ($f_1 \\neq f_2$) is resolved by noting that the problem specifies \"identical frequency,\" which implies identical unperturbed site energies ($E_1 = E_2 = E_0$), but allows for different transition dipole moment magnitudes, a common scenario in real systems. The problem is thus deemed valid.\n\nStep 2: Theoretical Framework\nThe system consists of two monomers, labeled $1$ and $2$, with unperturbed excited states $|\\phi_1\\rangle$ and $|\\phi_2\\rangle$ at the same energy $E_0$. The excitonic coupling between them is $J$. The Hamiltonian in the basis $\\{|\\phi_1\\rangle, |\\phi_2\\rangle\\}$ is given by:\n$$H = \\begin{pmatrix} E_0 & J \\\\ J & E_0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are the energies of the two exciton states:\n$$E_{\\pm} = E_0 \\pm J$$\nThe corresponding normalized eigenvectors, representing the exciton wavefunctions, are the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the monomeric states:\n$$|\\Psi_+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\phi_1\\rangle + |\\phi_2\\rangle)$$\n$$|\\Psi_-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\phi_1\\rangle - |\\phi_2\\rangle)$$\n\nStep 3: Oscillator Strength Distribution\nThe transition dipole moment from the ground state $|G\\rangle$ to an exciton state $|\\Psi_k\\rangle$ is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_k = \\langle G| \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}} | \\Psi_k \\rangle$. For the two exciton states, these are:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\pm} = \\langle G| \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}} | \\Psi_{\\pm} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\langle G| \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}} | \\phi_1 \\rangle \\pm \\langle G| \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}} | \\phi_2 \\rangle) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_1 \\pm \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_2)$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_2$ are the transition dipole moments of the individual monomers.\n\nThe oscillator strength $f$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the transition dipole moment, $f \\propto |\\boldsymbol{\\mu}|^2$. The problem provides the explicit formula $f = \\frac{2 m_e \\omega}{3 \\hbar e^2} |\\boldsymbol{\\mu}|^2$ and states that the frequency factor $\\omega$ can be considered constant and equal to $\\omega_0$.

This final practice confronts this complexity head-on, presenting a thought experiment where two conformers produce opposing ECCD signals, potentially leading to a misleading or null experimental result. Your task is to reason through how experimental variables like temperature and solvent can be manipulated to untangle these competing contributions, a critical skill for the robust application of ECCD in structural elucidation [@problem_id:3701455].", "problem": "Consider a bis-chromophore organic molecule used for Exciton Coupled Circular Dichroism (ECCD), where the exciton couplet arises from dipole–dipole interaction between two electronically allowed transitions on covalently linked chromophores. Circular Dichroism (CD) is defined as the difference in absorption of left versus right circularly polarized light, and its intensity for a transition is quantified by the rotational strength $R_{0n} = \\operatorname{Im}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{0n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{m}_{0n})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{0n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{m}_{0n}$ are the electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, respectively, and $\\operatorname{Im}$ denotes the imaginary part. In the exciton-coupling regime, the sign of the ECCD couplet reflects the handedness of the arrangement of the transition electric dipole moments of the two chromophores about the interchromophore axis; two conformers of the same absolute configuration can yield opposite ECCD signs if their local geometries have opposite handedness.\n\nAssume two rapidly equilibrating conformers, $A$ and $B$, whose exciton geometries yield equal-magnitude but opposite-sign rotational strengths in the principal couplet region: $R_A = +1.0$ (arbitrary units) and $R_B = -1.0$. Let the conformer energies be $E_A$ and $E_B$, and let the observed ECCD signal be the population-weighted sum $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = p_A(T)\\,R_A + p_B(T)\\,R_B$, where $p_i(T) = \\exp(-E_i/(RT))/Z(T)$, $Z(T) = \\sum_j \\exp(-E_j/(RT))$, and $R$ is the molar gas constant.\n\nIn a nonpolar solvent $S_{\\mathrm{np}}$, take $E_A = 0$ and $E_B - E_A = +0.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.

The first step, as mandated, is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System**: A bis-chromophore organic molecule with two rapidly equilibrating conformers, $A$ and $B$.\n- **Phenomenon**: Exciton Coupled Circular Dichroism (ECCD) arises from dipole–dipole interaction.\n- **Rotational Strengths**: For the principal couplet, the conformers have equal and opposite rotational strengths: $R_A = +1.0$ (arbitrary units) and $R_B = -1.0$.\n- **Observed Signal**: The observed ECCD signal is the population-weighted sum: $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = p_A(T)\\,R_A + p_B(T)\\,R_B$.\n- **Conformer Populations**: The populations follow a Boltzmann distribution: $p_i(T) = \\exp(-E_i/(RT))/Z(T)$, with the partition function $Z(T) = \\sum_j \\exp(-E_j/(RT))$. $R$ is the molar gas constant.\n- **Condition in Nonpolar Solvent ($S_{\\mathrm{np}}$)**: The energy of conformer $A$ is taken as the reference, $E_A = 0$.

A full solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe observed rotational strength is given by:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = p_A(T)\\,R_A + p_B(T)\\,R_B$$\nSubstituting the given values $R_A = +1.0$ and $R_B = -1.0$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = p_A(T) - p_B(T)$$\nThe populations of the two conformers are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. Let $\\Delta E = E_B - E_A$. We can set $E_A=0$ without loss of generality, so $E_B = \\Delta E$.\n$$p_A(T) = \\frac{e^{-E_A/(RT)}}{e^{-E_A/(RT)} + e^{-E_B/(RT)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\Delta E/(RT)}}$$\n$$p_B(T) = \\frac{e^{-E_B/(RT)}}{e^{-E_A/(RT)} + e^{-E_B/(RT)}} = \\frac{e^{-\\Delta E/(RT)}}{1 + e^{-\\Delta E/(RT)}}$$\nThe observed signal is then:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = p_A(T) - p_B(T) = \\frac{1 - e^{-\\Delta E/(RT)}}{1 + e^{-\\Delta E/(RT)}}$$\nThis can be expressed using the hyperbolic tangent function:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = \\tanh(\\frac{\\Delta E}{2RT})$$\nWe use the molar gas constant $R \\approx 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} = 0.008314\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$. At $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the thermal energy is $RT \\approx (0.008314\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2.478\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\nStatement: In $S_{\\mathrm{np}}$ at $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, partial cancellation between $A$ and $B$ yields a small positive $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$; lowering $T$ increases $|p_A - p_B|$ and magnifies $|R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|$, clarifying the sign.\n\n- In the nonpolar solvent $S_{\\mathrm{np}}$, $\\Delta E = E_B - E_A = +0.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- At $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the observed signal is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{obs}}(298\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\tanh(\\frac{+0.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}}{2 \\times 2.478\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}}) = \\tanh(0.1009) \\approx +0.1005$$\nThis value is small and positive, confirming partial cancellation yields a small positive signal. The first part of the statement is correct.\n- Now, consider lowering the temperature $T$. Since $\\Delta E > 0$, as $T$ decreases, the argument of the $\\tanh$ function, $\\frac{\\Delta E}{2RT}$, becomes a larger positive number. The $\\tanh(x)$ function is monotonically increasing for $x>0$ and approaches $1$ as $x \\to \\infty$. Thus, lowering $T$ increases $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ towards its maximum value of $+1$.\n- This means $|p_A - p_B|$ increases, and $|R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|$ is magnified. The sign remains positive, thus clarifying the result. The second part of the statement is also correct.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\nStatement: Raising $T$ increases the exciton coupling $|V|$ and therefore strengthens the couplet amplitude even if $p_A \\approx p_B$; thus higher $T$ resolves cancellation.\n\n- The statement makes two claims. First, that raising $T$ increases $|V|$. The problem provides no basis for this assertion. Exciton coupling $|V|$ depends on the distance and relative orientation of the transition dipole moments, and on the solvent's dielectric constant. Increased thermal motion at higher $T$ might average these geometric parameters, but there is no fundamental principle stating that this would systematically increase $|V|$. This claim is unsubstantiated.\n- Second, it claims high $T$ resolves cancellation. Let's analyze the effect of raising $T$ on $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. As $T \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{RT} \\to 0$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T \\to \\infty) = \\tanh(\\frac{\\Delta E}{2RT}) \\to \\tanh(0) = 0$$\nThis means that as $T$ increases, the populations equalize ($p_A \\to 0.5$ and $p_B \\to 0.5$), which leads to *maximum* cancellation, driving the observed signal to zero. High temperature exacerbates the cancellation problem, it does not resolve it.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\nStatement: Switching to a high-$\\varepsilon_r$ solvent without changing $E_B - E_A$ primarily reduces $|V|$ and weakens the couplet; solvent variation resolves cancellation only if it biases conformer populations.\n\n- The first part of the statement addresses the effect of a high dielectric constant ($\\varepsilon_r$). The problem states $|V| \\propto 1/\\varepsilon_r$. Therefore, increasing $\\varepsilon_r$ will decrease the magnitude of the exciton coupling $|V|$. The overall amplitude of the ECCD couplet is proportional to $|V|$, so weakening $|V|$ weakens the couplet. This part is correct.\n- The second part addresses the condition for resolving cancellation. Cancellation arises from the term $R_{\\mathrm{obs}} = p_A - p_B$ being close to zero. To resolve cancellation, one must increase the magnitude of this term. This requires making the populations $p_A$ and $p_B$ more unequal. populations depend on $\\Delta E$ and $T$. At a fixed $T$, changing the populations requires changing $\\Delta E$. A solvent's role in resolving cancellation is precisely its ability to differentially stabilize one conformer over the other, thereby changing $\\Delta E$ and biasing the population. If a solvent change did not affect $\\Delta E$, the cancellation term $p_A-p_B$ would be unchanged, and the only effect would be a scaling of the already-cancelled signal.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\nStatement: Choosing a solvent that differentially stabilizes $A$ (for example, increasing $E_B - E_A$ to $+1.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ at $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$) increases $|p_A - p_B|$ and $|R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|$ without changing the sign, thereby mitigating cancellation.\n\n- Differentially stabilizing conformer $A$ means making $E_A$ lower relative to $E_B$, which is equivalent to increasing the energy difference $\\Delta E = E_B - E_A$. The example gives $\\Delta E' = +1.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, which is larger than the original $\\Delta E = +0.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- The original signal was $R_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx +0.1005$.\n- The new signal at $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$R'_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\tanh(\\frac{+1.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}}{2 \\times 2.478\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}}) = \\tanh(0.3027) \\approx +0.2939$$\n- Comparing the magnitudes: $|R'_{\\mathrm{obs}}| \\approx 0.2939 > 0.1005 \\approx |R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|$. The magnitude of the observed signal has indeed increased. This is because $|p_A - p_B|$ has increased.\n- The sign of the original signal was positive, and the new signal is also positive. The sign has not changed.\n- The action described (increasing $\\Delta E$) biases the equilibrium further towards conformer $A$, which has a positive rotational strength, thus strengthening the observed positive signal and mitigating the cancellation from conformer $B$.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option E Evaluation**\nStatement: Increasing sample concentration to promote intermolecular exciton coupling will selectively amplify the intrinsic ECCD of conformer $A$ and improve assignment without introducing artifacts.\n\n- The problem is concerned with *intramolecular* ECCD, a property of a single molecule. Increasing sample concentration promotes aggregation, leading to *intermolecular* interactions.\n- These intermolecular interactions (e.g., between two molecules of conformer $A$, two of $B$, or one of $A$ and one of $B$) create new exciton couplings. These result in complex, concentration-dependent CD signals that are superimposed on, and often obscure, the desired intramolecular signal.\n- Such aggregation-induced CD is considered a significant experimental artifact to be avoided when studying the properties of an isolated molecule. There is no physical reason to assume this effect would \"selectively amplify\" the signal of conformer $A$. The statement that this would \"improve assignment without introducing artifacts\" is the opposite of the truth; it introduces severe artifacts that confound the assignment.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Summary of Correct Statements\nBased on the analysis, statements A, C, and D are correct.\n- A correctly describes the effect of lowering temperature.\n- C correctly describes the role of solvent polarity on $|V|$ and the necessity of altering conformer populations to resolve cancellation.\n- D correctly describes how a solvent can be used to bias the conformational equilibrium and mitigate cancellation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3701455"}]}
