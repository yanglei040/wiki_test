It is defined as the ratio of the circular differential absorbance, $\\Delta A$, to the total absorbance, $A$.\n\nThe circular differential absorbance is the difference between the absorbance of left-circularly polarized (LCP) light, $A_L$, and right-circularly polarized (RCP) light, $A_R$.\n$$ \\Delta A = A_L - A_R $$\nThe total absorbance, $A$, measured with unpolarized light, is the average of the absorbances for LCP and RCP light.\n$$ A = \\frac{A_L + A_R}{2} $$\nThe definition of the dissymmetry factor at a specific wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is therefore:\n$$ g(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\frac{\\Delta A(\\tilde{\\nu})}{A(\\tilde{\\nu})} $$\nThe problem provides the necessary values at the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_{0} = 1715\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$:\n-   Total absorbance: $A(\\tilde{\\nu}_{0}) = 0.820$\n-   Circular differential absorbance: $\\Delta A(\\tilde{\\nu}_{0}) = +2.050 \\times 10^{-3}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition:\n$$ g(\\tilde{\\nu}_{0}) = \\frac{+2.050 \\times 10^{-3}}{0.820} $$\n$$ g(\\tilde{\\nu}_{0}) = 0.0025 $$\nThe problem requests the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ g(\\tilde{\\nu}_{0}) = 2.500 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of the Dissymmetry Factor**\n\nThe interpretation requires connecting this macroscopic, experimentally determined value of $g$ to the underlying microscopic molecular properties, specifically the rotational strength of the vibrational transition.\n\nAccording to the Beer-Lambert law, absorbance is proportional to the molar absorptivity ($\\epsilon$), the concentration ($c$), and the optical pathlength ($l$). For circularly polarized light, we have:\n$$ A_L(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\epsilon_L(\\tilde{\\nu}) c l $$\n$$ A_R(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\epsilon_R(\\tilde{\\nu}) c l $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_L$ and $\\epsilon_R$ are the molar absorptivities for LCP and RCP light, respectively.\n\nThe differential absorbance can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta A(\\tilde{\\nu}) = A_L(\\tilde{\\nu}) - A_R(\\tilde{\\nu}) = (\\epsilon_L(\\tilde{\\nu}) - \\epsilon_R(\\tilde{\\nu})) c l = \\Delta\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu}) c l $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\epsilon = \\epsilon_L - \\epsilon_R$ is the differential molar absorptivity.\n\nThe total absorbance $A(\\tilde{\\nu})$ is related to the molar absorptivity for unpolarized light, $\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu}) = (\\epsilon_L(\\tilde{\\nu}) + \\epsilon_R(\\tilde{\\nu}))/2$:\n$$ A(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu}) c l $$\nThus, the dissymmetry factor can also be expressed as the ratio of the molar absorptivities:\n$$ g(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\frac{\\Delta A(\\tilde{\\nu})}{A(\\tilde{\\nu})} = \\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu}) c l}{\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu}) c l} = \\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})}{\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})} $$\n\nThe fundamental quantities governing IR absorption and VCD are the dipole strength ($D_{01}$) and rotational strength ($R_{01}$) for a vibrational transition from state $|0\\rangle$ to state $|1\\rangle$.\n\nThe dipole strength $D_{01}$ is proportional to the integrated intensity of the IR absorption band and is defined by the square of the electric dipole transition moment, $\\vec{\\mu}_{01} = \\langle 0 | \\vec{\\mu} | 1 \\rangle$:\n$$ D_{01} = |\\vec{\\mu}_{01}|^2 $$\nThe relationship to the integrated molar absorptivity is:\n$$ \\int_{\\text{band}} \\frac{\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})}{\\tilde{\\nu}} d\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto D_{01} $$\n\nThe rotational strength $R_{01}$ is proportional to the integrated intensity of the VCD band and is defined by the imaginary part of the scalar product of the electric dipole transition moment and the magnetic dipole transition moment, $\\vec{m}_{10} = \\langle 1 | \\vec{m} | 0 \\rangle$:\n$$ R_{01} = \\text{Im}\\{\\langle 0 | \\vec{\\mu} | 1 \\rangle \\cdot \\langle 1 | \\vec{m} | 0 \\rangle\\} = \\text{Im}\\{\\vec{\\mu}_{01} \\cdot \\vec{m}_{10}\\} $$\nThe relationship to the integrated differential molar absorptivity is:\n$$ \\int_{\\text{band}} \\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})}{\\tilde{\\nu}} d\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto R_{01} $$\n\nThe ratio of the integrated VCD intensity to the integrated IR intensity gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$ \\frac{\\int_{\\text{band}} \\Delta\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})/\\tilde{\\nu} \\, d\\tilde{\\nu}}{\\int_{\\text{band}} \\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu})/\\tilde{\\nu} \\, d\\tilde{\\nu}} = \\frac{4R_{01}}{D_{01}} $$\nFor a well-isolated band, such as the carbonyl stretch in this problem, it is a valid approximation to relate the ratio of the peak values to the ratio of the integrated values. Therefore, the dissymmetry factor at the band maximum, $g(\\tilde{\\nu}_0)$, is approximately proportional to the ratio of the rotational strength to the dipole strength:\n$$ g(\\tilde{\\nu}_0) = \\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu}_0)}{\\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu}_0)} \\approx \\frac{4 R_{01}}{D_{01}} = \\frac{4 \\, \\text{Im}\\{\\vec{\\mu}_{01} \\cdot \\vec{m}_{10}\\}}{|\\vec{\\mu}_{01}|^2} $$\n\n**Interpretation of the Sign:**\nThe calculated dissymmetry factor is positive ($g = +2.500 \\times 10^{-3}$). Since $D_{01} = |\\vec{\\mu}_{01}|^2$ is always non-negative, the sign of $g$ is determined by the sign of the rotational strength, $R_{01}$. A positive $g$ implies a positive $R_{01}$. A positive rotational strength indicates that the electric and magnetic transition dipole moment vectors, $\\vec{\\mu}_{01}$ and $\\vec{m}_{10}$, have parallel components and that the charge displacement during the vibration follows a right-handed helical path. This is a direct reflection of the absolute stereochemistry of the chiral molecule in the vicinity of the carbonyl group.\n\n**Interpretation of the Magnitude:**\nThe magnitude of the dissymmetry factor is $|g| = 2.500 \\times 10^{-3}$. In chiroptical spectroscopy, magnitudes of $g$ for VCD typically range from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$. The calculated value falls squarely within this expected range, representing a moderately strong VCD signal. The small magnitude of $g$ is a fundamental consequence of the fact that magnetic dipole transition moments are generally much weaker than electric dipole transition moments. The magnitude of $g$ reflects the efficiency of the coupling between the electric and magnetic properties of the light-matter interaction for the specific vibrational mode, which in turn depends on the molecular geometry. A strong IR absorption (large $D_{01}$) combined with a significant rotational strength (moderately large $R_{01}$) for this carbonyl mode results in a dissymmetry factor of the observed magnitude.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.500 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "3728272"}, {"introduction": "Flexible molecules rarely exist in a single, static shape; instead, they populate an ensemble of interconverting conformers.

Optimize geometry with DFT and include anharmonic corrections by Vibrational Perturbation Theory to second order (VPT2); compute APT and AAT and $\\,R_k\\,$; use a Voigt line shape $\\,g(\\omega)\\,$ with Gaussian FWHM $\\,12\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\\,$ and Lorentzian FWHM $\\,6\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\\,$; report the single-conformer spectrum in vacuum without scaling or Boltzmann averaging.**\n\nThis workflow uses some advanced techniques (VPT2, Voigt profile) but fails on the most fundamental aspects of modeling the specified experiment:\n*   It reports a single-conformer spectrum, completely neglecting the Boltzmann-weighted average over the conformational ensemble that exists at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n*   It performs the calculation in vacuum, ignoring essential solvent effects.\nFor a flexible molecule in solution, the errors introduced by ignoring conformers and solvent are typically far greater than the errors corrected by moving from a scaled harmonic treatment to a single-conformer VPT2 calculation. Therefore, this workflow is less realistic for predicting the target experimental spectrum than workflow A.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** Despite its use of sophisticated methods, this workflow fails to model the experimental system (a solution-phase ensemble of conformers) and is therefore not a realistic approach.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only workflow that is both scientifically correct and pragmatically designed to realistically predict the specified experimental spectrum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3728246"}]}
