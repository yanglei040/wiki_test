When the frequency difference $\\omega_p - \\omega_S$ matches a vibrational frequency $\\omega_v$ of a molecule in the sample, a coherent signal is generated at the anti-Stokes frequency $\\omega_{AS} = 2\\omega_p - \\omega_S$.\n\nThis signal originates from a third-order nonlinear polarization, $P_{AS}^{(3)}$, induced in the medium by the incident laser fields. The generation of the CARS signal can be described by the following set of fundamental relationships:\n\n1.  The third-order polarization at the anti-Stokes frequency is given by $P_{AS}^{(3)} = \\epsilon_0 \\chi_{CARS}^{(3)} E_p^2 E_S^*$, where $E_p$ and $E_S$ are the complex amplitudes of the pump and Stokes electric fields, respectively, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\n2.
