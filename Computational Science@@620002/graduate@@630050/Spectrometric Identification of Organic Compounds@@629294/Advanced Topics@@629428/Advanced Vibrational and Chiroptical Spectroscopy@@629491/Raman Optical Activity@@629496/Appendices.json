These invariants are functions of the tensor components.\n\nFirst, we determine the isotropic invariant, $\\bar{\\alpha}$, which represents the mean polarizability. Any second-rank tensor can be decomposed into a sum of its irreducible components. For a symmetric tensor, this decomposition is into an isotropic part and a symmetric-traceless (anisotropic) part. The isotropic part is related to the trace of the tensor. The trace of a tensor is a fundamental rotational invariant. The isotropic polarizability, $\\bar{\\alpha}$, is defined as one-third of the trace of the polarizability tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i} \\alpha_{ii} = \\frac{1}{3}(\\alpha_{xx} + \\alpha_{yy} + \\alpha_{zz})\n$$\nSubstituting the given diagonal components:\n$$\n\\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} (10.8 + 9.6 + 8.9)\\ \\text{\\AA}^{3} = \\frac{1}{3} (29.3)\\ \\text{\\AA}^{3} \\approx 9.7666... \\text{\\AA}^{3}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the anisotropy invariant, $\\gamma^{2}$. This invariant quantifies the deviation of the tensor from being isotropic.

The sum of the squares of the components of this anisotropic tensor, $\\sum_{i,j} (\\alpha_{ij}^{(\\text{aniso})})^2$, is a rotational invariant. In Raman spectroscopy, the anisotropy invariant $\\gamma^2$ is conventionally defined as:\n$$\n\\gamma^{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\sum_{i,j} \\left( \\alpha_{ij}^{(\\text{aniso})} \\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{2} \\sum_{i,j} (\\alpha_{ij} - \\bar{\\alpha}\\delta_{ij})^2\n$$\nTo calculate this, we can expand the sum.

The phenomenon arises from interference between light waves scattered by different induced multipole moments in a chiral molecule. In the framework presented, the key contributors are the induced electric dipole moment $\\mathbf{p}$ and the induced magnetic dipole moment $\\mathbf{m}$.\n\nThe intensity of scattered light is proportional to the squared magnitude of the far-zone scattered electric field. This field is the sum of contributions from the induced multipoles. The leading terms are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{scat}} = \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{p}} + \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{m}} + \\dots\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{p}}$ is the field radiated by $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{m}}$ is the field radiated by $\\mathbf{m}$. The total scattered intensity $I$ is proportional to $|\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{scat}}|^2$:\n$$\nI \\propto |\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{p}}|^2 + |\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{m}}|^2 + 2\\text{Re}(\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{p}}^{*} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{m}})\n$$\nThe first term, $|\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{p}}|^2$, gives rise to conventional Raman scattering, which is strong and independent of chirality in the first order. The second term, $|\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{m}}|^2$, corresponds to magnetic dipole scattering, which is much weaker. The third term, $2\\text{Re}(\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{p}}^{*} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{m}})$, is an interference term. It is this term that gives rise to ROA, as it is linear in the magnetic dipole contribution and changes sign with the handedness of the incident light and the molecule.\n\nThe induced moments $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{m}$ are related to the incident electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ via the tensors $\\alpha$ and $G'$. For an isotropic sample (randomly oriented molecules), the observed ROA intensity $I^{R} - I^{L}$ is proportional to rotationally invariant scalar quantities formed from contractions of these tensors. The problem defines one such simplified invariant, $S = \\sum_{i,j} \\tilde{\\alpha}_{ij} \\tilde{G}'_{ij}$.\n\nThe sign of this scalar invariant reflects the overall, orientationally-averaged phase relationship between the components of the polarizability tensor $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{ij}$ and the ROA tensor $\\tilde{G}'_{ij}$.\n-   If $S > 0$: This indicates that, on average, the corresponding components of $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{ij}$ and $\\tilde{G}'_{ij}$ have the same sign. This leads to a specific interference effect (constructive for one polarization, destructive for the other) that, by convention, results in a positive ROA band ($I^{R} > I^{L}$).\n-   If $S < 0$: This indicates that, on average, the corresponding components of $\\tilde{\\alpha}_{ij}$ and $\\tilde{G}'_{ij}$ have opposite signs. This reverses the interference patterns compared to the $S>0$ case, leading to a negative ROA band ($I^{R} < I^{L}$, or equivalently $I^{L} > I^{R}$).\n\nIn our calculation, we found $S = -10$, which is a negative value. Therefore, a negative value of $S$ implies that for the vibrational mode described by these tensors, one would observe a negative ROA band in a backscattering experiment, meaning the intensity of scattered light is greater for left-circularly polarized incident light than for right-circularly polarized incident light.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-10}\n$$", "id": "3720611"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges the gap between theoretical calculation and experimental observation by simulating a complete ROA spectrum.

For a set of conformers at a temperature $T$, the population weight $w_j$ of conformer $j$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $b_j = \\exp(-G_j / (RT))$, where $G_j$ is its molar Gibbs free energy and $R$ is the universal gas constant.

The step size for this grid is fixed at $0.01 \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\nNext, the function $I_k(\\nu)$ is evaluated at each point on this frequency grid, yielding an array of intensity values. The absolute values of this array, $|I_k(\\nu)|$, are then computed. The index corresponding to the maximum value in this absolute intensity array is identified. The frequency $\\nu$ at this index is the desired band extremum position, $\\nu_k^{\\ast}$.\n\nFinally, the sign of the band, $s_k$, is determined by the sign of the original (not absolute) intensity value at the extremum frequency, $I_k(\\nu_k^{\\ast})$. This is computed using the sign function, $s_k = \\operatorname{sign}(I_k(\\nu_k^{\\ast}))$, which yields $+1$, $-1$, or $0$.\n\nThis entire procedure is systematically applied to each of the four test cases, using the specific parameters provided for each. The resulting pairs of $(\\nu_k^{\\ast}, s_k)$ for each case are collected and formatted into the required output string.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ROA conformational averaging problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 8.314462618  # Universal gas constant in J mol^-1 K^-1\n\n    # Test cases defined in the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a dictionary for clarity.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"T\": 298, \"sigma\": 6.0,\n            \"G\": [0.0, 1.0],  # kJ/mol\n            \"nu_harm\": [1000.0, 995.0],  # cm^-1\n            \"delta_nu\": [-5.0, 3.0],  # cm^-1\n            \"A\": [1.0, 0.8]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 298, \"sigma\": 5.0,\n            \"G\": [0.0, 0.0],\n            \"nu_harm\": [1000.0, 1005.0],\n            \"delta_nu\": [0.0, 0.0],\n            \"A\": [1.0, -0.9]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 298, \"sigma\": 3.0,\n            \"G\": [0.0, 5.0],\n            \"nu_harm\": [1020.0, 1018.0],\n            \"delta_nu\": [1.0, -2.0],\n            \"A\": [-1.2, 1.0]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 100, \"sigma\": 4.0,\n            \"G\": [0.0, 1.0],\n            \"nu_harm\": [950.0, 960.0],\n            \"delta_nu\": [4.0, -6.0],\n            \"A\": [-0.6, 1.0]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        T = case[\"T\"]\n        sigma = case[\"sigma\"]\n        G_kj = np.array(case[\"G\"])\n        nu_harm = np.array(case[\"nu_harm\"])\n        delta_nu = np.array(case[\"delta_nu\"])\n        A = np.array(case[\"A\"])\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate corrected frequencies\n        nu_corr = nu_harm + delta_nu\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate Boltzmann populations\n        G_j = G_kj * 1000.0  # Convert kJ/mol to J/mol\n        boltzmann_factors = np.exp(-G_j / (R * T))\n        w = boltzmann_factors / np.sum(boltzmann_factors)\n\n        # Step 3: Set up the frequency grid\n        nu_min_corr = np.min(nu_corr)\n        nu_max_corr = np.max(nu_corr)\n        grid_start = nu_min_corr - 5 * sigma\n        grid_end = nu_max_corr + 5 * sigma\n        step = 0.01\n        # Use np.arange which is suitable for a fixed step size.
