Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem statement is valid, scientifically sound, and well-posed. I will proceed with the detailed derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe intensity of a Raman band in a resonance Raman experiment is governed by the properties of the electronic transition being excited. The problem involves two primary enhancement mechanisms, described by the Albrecht $A$ and $B$ terms.\n\n1.  **Albrecht A-term (Franck-Condon Scattering):** This term provides enhancement for totally symmetric vibrational modes ($a_{1g}$ in $D_{6h}$). Its intensity is proportional to the square of the electronic transition dipole moment at the equilibrium geometry, $(\\mu^{(0)})^2$. The problem states that the $\\,^{1}A_{1g} \\to \\,^{1}B_{2u}$ transition is symmetry-forbidden. Let us verify this using group theory.\n\n    A transition is allowed if the transition moment integral, $\\langle \\Psi_g | \\hat{\\mu} | \\Psi_e \\rangle$, is non-zero. For this to occur, the direct product of the symmetries of the components must contain the totally symmetric representation ($A_{1g}$ for $D_{6h}$).\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(\\Psi_g) \\times \\Gamma(\\hat{\\mu}) \\times \\Gamma(\\Psi_e) \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given symmetries:\n    $$\n    A_{1g} \\times E_{1u} \\times B_{2u}\n    $$\n    Since $A_{1g}$ is the identity representation, we need to compute the direct product $E_{1u} \\times B_{2u}$. Using the character table for the $D_{6h}$ point group:\n    $$\n    E_{1u} \\times B_{2u} = E_{2g}\n    $$\n    The full direct product is thus:\n    $$\n    A_{1g} \\times E_{2g} = E_{2g}\n    $$\n    Since $E_{2g}$ is not $A_{1g}$, the direct product does not contain the totally symmetric representation. The transition is indeed symmetry-forbidden, so $\\mu^{(0)}=0$. Consequently, the Albrecht $A$-term is zero, and there will be no significant Franck-Condon enhancement for totally symmetric ($a_{1g}$) modes.\n\n2.  **Albrecht B-term (Herzberg-Teller Scattering):** This mechanism becomes dominant when the electronic transition is symmetry-forbidden or weak. It describes how a non-totally symmetric vibration, known as a promoting mode ($Q_p$), can \"lend\" or \"borrow\" intensity from a nearby strongly allowed electronic transition.\n\n    The promoting mode $Q_p$ couples the target excited state $\\Psi_e$ (of symmetry $\\Gamma_e = B_{2u}$) with another electronic state $\\Psi_s$ (of symmetry $\\Gamma_s$) for which the transition from the ground state is strongly allowed.\n\n    First, let's determine the symmetry $\\Gamma_s$ of the state $\\Psi_s$ from which intensity can be borrowed. The transition $\\Psi_g \\to \\Psi_s$ must be allowed:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(\\Psi_g) \\times \\Gamma(\\hat{\\mu}) \\times \\Gamma_s \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    $$\n    A_{1g} \\times E_{1u} \\times \\Gamma_s \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    This requires that $E_{1u} \\times \\Gamma_s$ contains $A_{1g}$. In a point group with an inversion center, this is only possible if $\\Gamma_s = E_{1u}$. The state from which intensity is borrowed must have $E_{1u}$ symmetry. (This corresponds to the strongly allowed $\\,^{1}E_{1u} \\leftarrow \\,^{1}A_{1g}$ Soret band in benzene).\n\n    Second, let's find the symmetry of the promoting mode, $\\Gamma(Q_p)$, that couples $\\Psi_e$ and $\\Psi_s$. The vibronic coupling operator has the symmetry of the vibrational normal coordinate, $\\Gamma(Q_p)$. The coupling integral $\\langle \\Psi_e | \\hat{H}_{vib} | \\Psi_s \\rangle$ must be non-zero, meaning the direct product of the symmetries must contain $A_{1g}$:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(\\Psi_e) \\times \\Gamma(Q_p) \\times \\Gamma_s \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    Substituting the known symmetries:\n    $$\n    B_{2u} \\times \\Gamma(Q_p) \\times E_{1u} \\supset A_{1g}\n    $$\n    For this to be true, $\\Gamma(Q_p)$ must have the same symmetry as the direct product $B_{2u} \\times E_{1u}$. As calculated before:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(Q_p) = B_{2u} \\times E_{1u} = E_{2g}\n    $$\n    Therefore, the promoting modes must have $e_{2g}$ symmetry. These are the vibrations that make the forbidden electronic transition vibronically allowed.\n\n    According to the problem statement and the principles of RR spectroscopy, the Albrecht $B$-term strongly enhances scattering via the promoting modes. Thus, the fundamentals of the $e_{2g}$ vibrational modes are expected to be the most strongly enhanced features in the RR spectrum.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Only $a_{1g}$ fundamentals are strongly enhanced; non-totally symmetric modes remain weak.**\n    This describes Albrecht A-term enhancement. As shown above, the A-term is zero because the electronic transition is forbidden ($\\mu^{(0)}=0$). Therefore, $a_{1g}$ modes are not expected to be strongly enhanced via the Franck-Condon mechanism. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. $e_{2g}$ fundamentals are strongly enhanced via vibronic coupling; $a_{1g}$ fundamentals are weak or absent under direct resonance with the $\\,^{1}B_{2u}$ band.**\n    My derivation showed that modes of $e_{2g}$ symmetry act as promoting modes for the $\\,^{1}B_{2u} \\leftarrow \\,^{1}A_{1g}$ transition. Herzberg-Teller theory (Albrecht B-term) predicts strong enhancement for these promoting modes in RR. The statement that $a_{1g}$ fundamentals are weak or absent is also correct, as their primary enhancement mechanism (A-term) is switched off. This option accurately describes the expected spectroscopic outcome. This option is **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. $e_{1g}$ and $b_{1g}$ modes are enhanced because $E_{1u}$ couples $\\,^{1}A_{1g}$ to $\\,^{1}B_{2u}$ through $e_{1g}$ symmetry.**\n    The reasoning in this option is confused. The operator $\\hat{\\mu}$ with symmetry $E_{1u}$ mediates the transition but doesn't \"couple\" states in the sense of vibronic coupling. We can test if an $e_{1g}$ mode could be a promoting mode. The coupled state would have symmetry $B_{2u} \\times E_{1g} = E_{2u}$. A transition from $A_{1g}$ to $E_{2u}$ is forbidden, as $A_{1g} \\times E_{1u} \\times E_{2u}$ does not contain $A_{1g}$. If a $b_{1g}$ mode were promoting, the coupled state would have symmetry $B_{2u} \\times B_{1g} = A_{2u}$. A transition to an $A_{2u}$ state is allowed, but via the $z$-polarized dipole component ($A_{2u}$), not the $xy$-component ($E_{1u}$) specified in the problem. The core logic of the problem requires coupling to an $E_{1u}$ state, which necessitates an $e_{2g}$ promoter. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. $b_{2u}$ modes are enhanced because the excited electronic state is $\\,^{1}B_{2u}$.**\n    This suggests a simplistic and incorrect correlation between the symmetry of the electronic state and the enhanced vibration. A group-theoretical analysis is required. If a $b_{2u}$ mode were the promoter, it would couple the $B_{2u}$ state to a state with symmetry $B_{2u} \\times B_{2u} = A_{1g}$. This is the ground state itself, so this coupling does not lead to borrowing intensity from an allowed excited-state transition.

The solid angle of a cone with half-angle $\\theta_c$ is given by:\n    $$\\Omega = 2\\pi(1 - \\cos(\\theta_c))$$\n    From the definition of $\\text{NA}$, we have $\\sin(\\theta_c) = \\frac{\\text{NA}}{n}$. Using the identity $\\cos(\\theta_c) = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(\\theta_c)}$, we find:\n    $$\\Omega = 2\\pi\\left(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\text{NA}}{n}\\right)^2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the equation for $R$:\n$$R = \\left(\\frac{P_L \\lambda_L}{A h c}\\right) \\cdot \\rho_N \\cdot (A \\ell) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}\\right) \\cdot \\Omega \\cdot \\eta$$\nThe beam area $A$ cancels out, which is an expected result for scattering from a dilute solution under these conditions.\n$$R = \\frac{P_L \\lambda_L \\rho_N \\ell}{h c} \\left(\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}\\right) \\Omega \\eta$$\nThe information regarding the Stokes shift, $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, is used to confirm that the provided efficiency $\\eta$ is indeed for the correct wavelength, but the value of the shift itself does not enter the final calculation.\n\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for the differential cross section, $\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}$:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{R \\cdot h c}{P_L \\lambda_L \\rho_N \\ell \\Omega \\eta}$$\n\nNext, we substitute the numerical values provided, ensuring consistent units.
