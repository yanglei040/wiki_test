The term \"weaker\" is appropriate since for most angles where $\\cot\\theta > |\\varepsilon_m|^{-1}\\varepsilon_d$, the normal component $|E_r|$ is stronger than the tangential component $|E_\\theta|$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The local field at the surface is everywhere purely normal for $a = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ nanoparticles, so planar surface selection rules apply exactly.**\n- This is false.

The normal component $E_r$ dominates over the tangential component $E_\\theta$ for a wide range of angles, as long as $\\tan\\theta < |\\varepsilon_m|/\\varepsilon_d \\approx 11.66$, which corresponds to $\\theta \\lesssim 85^\\circ$. The out-of-plane modes are strongly enhanced, not suppressed, as they are coupled to $E_r$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

The problem is framed entirely within the electromagnetic model. Our derivation based on this model explicitly shows that the local field orientation deviates from purely normal due to curvature, which in itself constitutes a modification of the selection rule.

Express the final answer for $c_A$ in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The fundamental principle of internal standardization is to use the signal from a co-adsorbed species ($S$) of known or constant surface coverage to normalize the signal from the analyte ($A$), thereby correcting for sources of experimental variability that affect both species proportionally. In SERS, this is particularly effective at correcting for spot-to-spot fluctuations in the local electromagnetic field enhancement, which is a major source of intensity variation.\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between the measured Raman intensity $I_k$ for a species $k$ and the molecular and experimental parameters. For a given measurement spot $i$, we can write the intensities for the analyte, $I_{A,i}$, and the internal standard, $I_{S,i}$, as:\n$$I_{A,i} = C |E_{\\mathrm{loc},i}|^4 N_A \\sigma_A f^{\\mathrm{chem}}_A f^{\\mathrm{ori}}_A$$\n$$I_{S,i} = C |E_{\\mathrm{loc},i}|^4 N_S \\sigma_S f^{\\mathrm{chem}}_S f^{\\mathrm{ori}}_S$$\nHere, $C$ is a constant incorporating the instrument factor $K$, incident intensity $I_0$, and other collection optics parameters. $|E_{\\mathrm{loc},i}|^4$ is the electromagnetic enhancement factor at spot $i$. $N_k$ is the number of molecules of species $k$ within the probed area, $A_{\\mathrm{probe}}$, such that $N_k = \\Gamma_k A_{\\mathrm{probe}}$, where $\\Gamma_k$ is the surface coverage (molecules per unit area).\n\nThe crucial step is to take the ratio of these two intensities for each spot $i$:\n$$R_i = \\frac{I_{A,i}}{I_{S,i}} = \\frac{C |E_{\\mathrm{loc},i}|^4 (\\Gamma_A A_{\\mathrm{probe}}) \\sigma_A f^{\\mathrm{chem}}_A f^{\\mathrm{ori}}_A}{C |E_{\\mathrm{loc},i}|^4 (\\Gamma_S A_{\\mathrm{probe}}) \\sigma_S f^{\\mathrm{chem}}_S f^{\\mathrm{ori}}_S}$$\nThe unknown and variable terms $C$, $|E_{\\mathrm{loc},i}|^4$, and the constant probed area $A_{\\mathrm{probe}}$ cancel out, yielding a ratio that depends only on the surface coverages and the intrinsic molecular properties:\n$$R_i = \\frac{\\Gamma_A}{\\Gamma_S} \\frac{\\sigma_A f^{\\mathrm{chem}}_A f^{\\mathrm{ori}}_A}{\\sigma_S f^{\\mathrm{chem}}_S f^{\\mathrm{ori}}_S}$$\nSince $\\Gamma_A$ and $\\Gamma_S$ are assumed to be uniform over the substrate, this ratio $R_i$ should ideally be constant across all measurement spots. The experimental data show variability, which we address by averaging.\n\nFirst, we calculate the intensity ratio for each of the $3$ measured spots:\n- Spot $1$: $R_1 = \\frac{I_{A,1}}{I_{S,1}} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{5}}{4.0 \\times 10^{5}} = 2.0$\n- Spot $2$: $R_2 = \\frac{I_{A,2}}{I_{S,2}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{6}} = 1.5$\n- Spot $3$: $R_3 = \\frac{I_{A,3}}{I_{S,3}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{5}}{2.5 \\times 10^{5}} = 1.2$\n\nThe average ratio, $\\bar{R}$, is calculated as the arithmetic mean:\n$$\\bar{R} = \\frac{R_1 + R_2 + R_3}{3} = \\frac{2.0 + 1.5 + 1.2}{3} = \\frac{4.7}{3}$$\n\nThis average ratio is set equal to the theoretical expression. Let us define a constant, $\\Phi$, which encapsulates the ratio of the intrinsic molecular response factors:\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{\\sigma_A f^{\\mathrm{chem}}_A f^{\\mathrm{ori}}_A}{\\sigma_S f^{\\mathrm{chem}}_S f^{\\mathrm{ori}}_S}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{(2.5 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}) \\times 4.0 \\times 0.85}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}) \\times 3.2 \\times 0.90} = \\frac{8.5}{5.76}$$\nThe theoretical ratio is now $\\bar{R} = \\frac{\\Gamma_A}{\\Gamma_S} \\Phi$.\n\nThe analyte surface coverage, $\\Gamma_A$, is related to the unknown bulk concentration, $c_A$, via the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$\\Gamma_A = \\Gamma_{A,\\max}\\,\\frac{K_A c_A}{1 + K_A c_A}$$\nSubstituting this into the ratio equation:\n$$\\bar{R} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma_S} \\left( \\Gamma_{A,\\max}\\,\\frac{K_A c_A}{1 + K_A c_A} \\right) \\Phi$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $c_A$. Rearranging the terms to isolate the fractional coverage term:\n$$\\frac{\\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}{\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max}} = \\frac{K_A c_A}{1 + K_A c_A}$$\nLet $X = \\frac{\\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}{\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max}}$. The equation becomes $X = \\frac{K_A c_A}{1 + K_A c_A}$.\nSolving for $K_A c_A$:\n$$X(1 + K_A c_A) = K_A c_A$$\n$$X + X K_A c_A = K_A c_A$$\n$$X = K_A c_A (1 - X)$$\n$$K_A c_A = \\frac{X}{1-X}$$\nFinally, we obtain the expression for $c_A$:\n$$c_A = \\frac{1}{K_A} \\frac{X}{1-X} = \\frac{1}{K_A} \\frac{\\frac{\\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}{\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max}}}{1 - \\frac{\\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}{\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max}}} = \\frac{1}{K_A} \\frac{\\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}{\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max} - \\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression. First, let's compute the dimensionless group $\\frac{\\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}{\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max} - \\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}$:\n$$\\bar{R} \\Gamma_S = \\left(\\frac{4.7}{3}\\right) (5.0 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}) = \\frac{23.5}{3} \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$$\n$$\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max} = \\left(\\frac{8.5}{5.76}\\right) (1.0 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}) = \\frac{8.5}{5.76} \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$$\nThe denominator term is:\n$$\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max} - \\bar{R} \\Gamma_S = \\left(\\frac{8.5}{5.76} \\times 10^{14} - \\frac{23.5}{3} \\times 10^{13}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$$\n$$= \\left(\\frac{8.5}{5.76} - \\frac{2.35}{3}\\right) \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = \\left(\\frac{3 \\times 8.5 - 5.76 \\times 2.35}{5.76 \\times 3}\\right) \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$$\n$$= \\left(\\frac{25.5 - 13.536}{17.28}\\right) \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = \\frac{11.964}{17.28} \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$$\nThe fractional term becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\bar{R} \\Gamma_S}{\\Phi \\Gamma_{A,\\max} - \\bar{R} \\Gamma_S} = \\frac{\\frac{23.5}{3} \\times 10^{13}}{\\frac{11.964}{17.28} \\times 10^{14}} = \\frac{\\frac{2.35}{3}}{\\frac{11.964}{17.28}} = \\frac{2.35}{3} \\times \\frac{17.28}{11.964} = \\frac{13.536}{11.964} \\approx 1.131394$$\nNow, we calculate $c_A$:\n$$c_A = \\frac{1}{K_A} \\left(\\frac{13.536}{11.964}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\left(\\frac{13.536}{11.964}\\right)$$\n$$c_A \\approx (0.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times 1.131394 \\approx 0.565697 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n$$c_A \\approx 5.65697 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$c_A \\approx 5.657 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nThis is the computed bulk analyte concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.657 \\times 10^{-6}}$$", "id": "3726397"}]}
