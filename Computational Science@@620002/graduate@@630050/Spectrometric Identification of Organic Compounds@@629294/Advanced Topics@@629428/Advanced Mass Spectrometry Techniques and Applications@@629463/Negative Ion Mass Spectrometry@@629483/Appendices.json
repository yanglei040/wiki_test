It provides all necessary physical constants and defines the terms for a standard calculation in the field of mass spectrometry. The compound class (perfluoroalkyl substances) and analytical technique (negative ESI-HRMS) are standard. The provided mass values are accepted monoisotopic masses. The setup is self-contained and free from contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a valid exercise in applying fundamental principles of mass spectrometry.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Exact Mass-to-Charge Ratio**\n\nThe neutral molecule, denoted by $\\mathrm{M}$, has the elemental composition $\\mathrm{C_8HF_{15}O_2}$. The exact mass of the neutral molecule, $m(\\mathrm{M})$, is the sum of the monoisotopic masses of its constituent atoms.\n\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 8 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) + 1 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{^1H}) + 15 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{^{19}F}) + 2 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{^{16}O})$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 8 \\cdot (12.000000) + 1 \\cdot (1.007825) + 15 \\cdot (18.998403) + 2 \\cdot (15.994915)$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 96.000000 + 1.007825 + 284.976045 + 31.989830$$\n$$m(\\mathrm{M}) = 413.973700 \\text{ u}$$\n\nThe problem states that the ion observed is the deprotonated molecular anion, $\\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-}$. This species is formed by the removal of a proton, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, from the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$. By conservation of mass and charge:\n$$\\mathrm{M} \\longrightarrow \\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$$\nThe mass of the resulting ion, $m_{\\text{ion}}$, is therefore the mass of the neutral molecule minus the mass of a proton, $m_p$.\n\n$$m_{\\text{ion}} = m(\\mathrm{M}) - m_p$$\n$$m_{\\text{ion}} = 413.973700 - 1.0072764669$$\n$$m_{\\text{ion}} = 412.9664235331 \\text{ u}$$\n\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, is defined as the ion's mass divided by the magnitude of its charge number, $|z|$. For the singly charged anion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{-}$, the charge number is $z = -1$, so $|z|=1$.\n\n$$m/z = \\frac{m_{\\text{ion}}}{|z|} = \\frac{412.9664235331}{1} = 412.9664235331$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $8$ significant figures.\nThe value is $412.9664235331$. The first $8$ significant figures are $4$, $1$, $2$, $9$, $6$, $6$, $4$, $2$. The ninth significant figure is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n\nThe final calculated $m/z$ is $412.96642$.\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of HRMS Constraints on Elemental Formulas**\n\nHigh-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) provides a measurement of an ion's $m/z$ with high precision, which in turn imposes stringent constraints on its possible elemental composition. This capability arises from the fundamental principle of mass defect.\n\nThe exact mass of any nuclide (except for $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$, by definition) is not an integer. The difference between a nuclide's exact mass and its integer mass number (the total count of protons and neutrons) is its mass defect. For the elements in question:\n- $m(\\mathrm{^{12}C}) = 12.000000$ u; Mass Defect = $0$\n- $m(\\mathrm{^1H}) = 1.007825$ u; Mass Defect = $+0.007825$ u\n- $m(\\mathrm{^{16}O}) = 15.994915$ u; Mass Defect = $-0.005085$ u\n- $m(\\mathrm{^{19}F}) = 18.998403$ u; Mass Defect = $-0.001597$ u\n\nHydrogen possesses a significant positive mass defect, while oxygen and fluorine possess negative mass defects. The exact mass of a molecule or ion is the sum of the exact masses of its constituent atoms, and its total mass defect is the sum of the individual atomic mass defects.\n\nAn HRMS instrument with a mass accuracy of $\\pm 2$ parts-per-million (ppm) can distinguish between ions whose masses differ by a very small amount. For our calculated $m/z$ of approximately $412.97$, a $2$ ppm error tolerance corresponds to an absolute mass window of:\n$$\\Delta m = \\frac{2}{10^6} \\times 412.97 \\approx 0.000826 \\text{ u}$$\nAny proposed elemental formula for the measured ion must have a theoretical exact mass that falls within the narrow range of $m/z_{\\text{measured}} \\pm 0.000826$ u.\n\nThis drastically constrains the number of possible formulas without an exhaustive search for the following reason: most substitutions of atoms or groups of atoms, even those that preserve the nominal (integer) mass, produce a change in exact mass far greater than the HRMS tolerance window.\n\nConsider the ion studied, whose neutral formula portion is $\\mathrm{C_8F_{15}O_2}$. Suppose we hypothesize an alternative formula by making a substitution that is nearly isobaric (i.e., has the same nominal mass). A classic near-isobaric pair is the hydroxyl radical and three hydrogens ($\\mathrm{OH_3}$, nominal mass $19$) and fluorine ($\\mathrm{F}$, nominal mass $19$).\nLet's test swapping one $\\mathrm{F}$ atom in our formula for one $\\mathrm{OH_3}$ group. The new trial formula would be $\\mathrm{C_8(OH_3)F_{14}O_2}$, which simplifies to $\\mathrm{C_8H_3F_{14}O_3}$.\nThe change in mass, $\\Delta m_{\\text{subst}}$, resulting from this substitution is:\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{subst}} = m(\\mathrm{O}) + 3 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H}) - m(\\mathrm{F})$$\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{subst}} = 15.994915 + 3 \\cdot (1.007825) - 18.998403$$\n$$\\Delta m_{\\text{subst}} = 15.994915 + 3.023475 - 18.998403 = 19.018390 - 18.998403 = +0.019987 \\text{ u}$$\n\nThis mass difference of approximately $+0.02$ u is more than $20$ times larger than the instrument's tolerance window of $\\sim \\pm 0.0008$ u. Therefore, HRMS can unequivocally distinguish between the true formula and this alternative. The same principle applies to other potential substitutions (e.g., swapping $\\mathrm{O}$ for $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ yields $\\Delta m = m(\\mathrm{C}) + 4 \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H}) - m(\\mathrm{O}) = +0.036385$ u).\n\nIn conclusion, HRMS constrains elemental formulas by leveraging mass defects. The unique mass defect signature of a specific combination of atoms results in a highly specific exact mass. Because the mass tolerance of an HRMS instrument is exceptionally small, it acts as a powerful filter. Instead of an unguided, exhaustive enumeration of all possible $\\mathrm{C_c H_h F_f O_o}$ combinations, one can immediately discard nearly all candidates because the slight changes in their elemental makeup lead to deviations in exact mass that fall well outside the narrow acceptance window defined by the ppm accuracy. This reduces a computationally intractable problem to identifying a single, or a very small number of, plausible chemical formulas.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{412.96642}\n$$", "id": "3714846"}, {"introduction": "Beyond exact mass, the isotopic pattern of an ion provides a rich layer of structural information, often revealing the presence of specific elements at a glance.

The goal is to predict the bromine-driven isotope pattern at high mass resolution and to rationalize how one can distinguish mono- versus dibromination from the observed pattern. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$, and for singly charged anions the magnitude of the charge is $|z|=1$, so $m/z$ differences between isotopologues equal their exact mass differences; (ii) isotopic composition arises from statistically independent substitution by available isotopes with fixed natural fractional abundances; (iii) the intensity of each isotopologue peak is proportional to its probability of occurrence in the ensemble of molecules; (iv) monoisotopic exact masses for bromine isotopes are fixed and known.\n\nYou are given the monoisotopic exact masses for bromine as $m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})=78.918338$ and $m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br})=80.916291$ (in daltons, Da), and the natural fractional abundances $a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})=0.5069$ and $a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br})=0.4931$.

We shall proceed with the solution by addressing each of the three parts of the problem in sequence.\n\nThe analysis is based on the following provided principles: (i) for a singly charged ion $[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$, the charge state is $z=-1$, so any difference in the measured mass-to-charge ratio, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is identical to the difference in the exact mass of the isotopologues, $\\Delta m$; (ii) the incorporation of different isotopes into the molecule is a statistically independent process governed by their natural fractional abundances; (iii) the relative intensity of a mass spectral peak is directly proportional to the relative abundance of the corresponding isotopologue. The relevant constants are the exact masses $m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})=78.918338~\\mathrm{Da}$ and $m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br})=80.916291~\\mathrm{Da}$, and their natural fractional abundances $a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})=0.5069$ and $a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br})=0.4931$.\n\n**1. Monobrominated Phenolic $[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ Ion**\n\nLet the molecular formula of the non-brominated part of the phenolic compound be denoted by $\\mathrm{R'}$. The full molecule $\\mathrm{M}$ is then $\\mathrm{R'Br}$. The observed ion is $[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-} = [\\mathrm{R'Br}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$. The mass of this ion depends on which of the two stable bromine isotopes, $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ or $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$, is present.\n\nThis leads to two primary isotopologues for the $[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ ion:\n- The lighter isotopologue, containing $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$, which we will denote as $I_{A}$. Its mass is $m_A = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$.\n- The heavier isotopologue, containing $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$, which we will denote as $I_{A+2}$. Its mass is $m_{A+2} = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$.\n\nThe corresponding measured $m/z$ values are $(m/z)_A = m_A$ and $(m/z)_{A+2} = m_{A+2}$ since $|z|=1$.\n\nThe expected $m/z$ spacing of the doublet is the difference between these two values:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = (m/z)_{A+2} - (m/z)_A = m_{A+2} - m_A\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = (m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})) - (m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H}))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values for the bromine isotope masses:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = 80.916291~\\mathrm{Da} - 78.918338~\\mathrm{Da} = 1.997953~\\mathrm{Da}\n$$\nThis is the exact separation between the two peaks of the isotopic doublet.\n\nThe relative intensity of each peak is proportional to the probability of that isotopologue's existence, which is determined by the natural fractional abundance of the respective bromine isotope. Let $I_A$ and $I_{A+2}$ be the intensities of the lower and higher mass peaks, respectively.\n$$\nI_A \\propto a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) = 0.5069\n$$\n$$\nI_{A+2} \\propto a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) = 0.4931\n$$\nThe expected relative intensity ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{A+2}}{I_A} = \\frac{a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br})}{a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})} = \\frac{0.4931}{0.5069} \\approx 0.97277\n$$\nThe two peaks are thus expected to have nearly equal intensities, with a ratio of approximately $100:97.3$. This characteristic $1:1$ doublet pattern with a spacing of $\\approx 2~\\mathrm{Da}$ is the signature of a single bromine atom.\n\n**2. Dibrominated Phenolic $[\\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ Ion**\n\nFor a dibrominated compound, denoted $\\mathrm{R'Br}_2$, the observed ion is $[\\mathrm{R'Br_2}-\\mathrm{H}]^{-}$. Since there are two bromine atoms, and the selection of the isotope for each atom is an independent event, we can model the probabilities using a binomial expansion. Let $p = a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) = 0.5069$ and $q = a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) = 0.4931$.\n\nThree isotopologue combinations are possible:\n- Two $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms: $(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{79}\\mathrm{Br})$. This gives the monoisotopic peak, which we will use as the baseline, denoted $I_A$.\n- One $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ and one $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$ atom: $(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{81}\\mathrm{Br})$. This gives the peak conventionally labeled $I_{A+2}$.\n- Two $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms: $(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{81}\\mathrm{Br})$. This gives the peak labeled $I_{A+4}$.\n\nThe $m/z$ positions relative to the monoisotopic baseline ($m/z$ of the $I_A$ peak) are derived as follows:\n- The mass of the $I_A$ isotopologue is $m_A = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + 2m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$. Let its $m/z$ be $(m/z)_A$.\n- The mass of the $I_{A+2}$ isotopologue is $m_{A+2} = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) + m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$. The shift from baseline is:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)_{A+2} = m_{A+2} - m_A = m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) = 1.997953~\\mathrm{Da}\n$$\n- The mass of the $I_{A+4}$ isotopologue is $m_{A+4} = m(\\mathrm{R'}) + 2m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$. The shift from baseline is:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z)_{A+4} = m_{A+4} - m_A = 2(m(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) - m(^{79}\\mathrm{Br})) = 2 \\times 1.997953~\\mathrm{Da} = 3.995906~\\mathrm{Da}\n$$\nThus, a triplet of peaks is expected, with adjacent peaks separated by a constant $m/z$ spacing of $1.997953~\\mathrm{Da}$.\n\nThe relative intensities are determined by the probabilities of these combinations:\n- Intensity $I_A$: Proportional to the probability of having two $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms, which is $p^2$.\n$$\np^2 = (0.5069)^2 \\approx 0.25694761\n$$\n- Intensity $I_{A+2}$: Proportional to the probability of having one $^{79}\\mathrm{Br}$ and one $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$ atom. There are two ways this can happen ($(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{81}\\mathrm{Br})$ and $(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}, ^{79}\\mathrm{Br})$), so the probability is $2pq$.\n$$\n2pq = 2 \\times 0.5069 \\times 0.4931 \\approx 0.49993358\n$$\n- Intensity $I_{A+4}$: Proportional to the probability of having two $^{81}\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms, which is $q^2$.\n$$\nq^2 = (0.4931)^2 \\approx 0.24314761\n$$\nThe expected relative intensity ratio is $I_A:I_{A+2}:I_{A+4} = p^2 : 2pq : q^2$. Using the calculated values, the ratio is approximately $0.257 : 0.500 : 0.243$. Normalizing to the most intense peak ($I_{A+2}$) gives a ratio of approximately $51.4:100:48.6$. This is a characteristic $1:2:1$ pattern.\n\n**3. Distinguishing Mono- versus Dibromination**\n\nThe results derived above provide a clear and unambiguous method for distinguishing between monobromination and dibromination from the negative-ion mass spectrum, without any knowledge of the molecular backbone (the C-H-O composition). The distinction rests on two key features of the observed isotope pattern in the molecular ion region:\n\n1.  **Number of Peaks:** A monobrominated compound produces a characteristic **doublet** (two main peaks). In contrast, a dibrominated compound produces a characteristic **triplet** (three main peaks). This is the most immediate distinguishing feature.\n\n2.  **Relative Intensity Pattern:** The intensity ratios of the peaks within the cluster are distinctly different.\n    - For monobromination, the two peaks of the doublet have nearly equal intensities, with a ratio of $a(^{79}\\mathrm{Br}) : a(^{81}\\mathrm{Br}) \\approx 1:1$.\n    - For dibromination, the three peaks of the triplet exhibit a binomial intensity distribution of $p^2 : 2pq : q^2 \\approx 1:2:1$. The central peak is the most abundant, approximately twice as intense as either of the flanking peaks.\n\nThe underlying chemical composition of the phenolic moiety (the $\\mathrm{R'}$ part) only determines the absolute $m/z$ value at which this pattern appears, effectively shifting the entire cluster along the $m/z$ axis. However, the internal structure of the cluster—the number of peaks, their precise spacing ($\\approx 1.998~\\mathrm{Da}$), and their relative intensity pattern—is determined solely by the number of bromine atoms in the molecule. Therefore, by observing a doublet of $\\approx 1:1$ intensity ratio versus a triplet of $\\approx 1:2:1$ intensity ratio, one can confidently assign the compound as mono- or dibrominated, respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.997953}$$", "id": "3714812"}, {"introduction": "Mass spectrometry is not merely a passive measurement tool; it can also be an active experimental science for probing molecular structure.

All ions are singly charged, so $m/z$ equals the ion's mass.\n    2.  H/D exchange occurs on the neutral molecule prior to ionization.\n    3.  The deprotonated ion's mass is independent of whether it formed from a protonated or deuterated neutral.\n    4.  The chloride adduct's mass reflects the isotopic state (protonated or deuterated) of the neutral molecule it attaches to.\n-   **Initial Experimental Data (without $\\mathrm{D_{2}O}$):**\n    -   Two prominent peaks observed at $m/z \\approx 179.0345$ and $m/z \\approx 215.0111$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard H/D exchange experiment. To verify consistency, we calculate the theoretical masses of the proposed ions.\n\n-   **Theoretical mass of the deprotonated ion $[M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}$:**\n    This ion forms by removing $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ from the neutral $M$.\n    $$m([M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}) = m(M) - m(\\mathrm{H}^{+}) = m(M) - (m(\\mathrm{H}) - m_e)$$\n    A more direct calculation is that the mass of the deprotonated species is the mass of the neutral molecule minus the mass of the proton removed.\n    $$m([M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}) = m(M) - m(\\mathrm{H}) = 180.042275\\,\\mathrm{u} - 1.007825\\,\\mathrm{u} = 179.03445\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n    This matches the observed peak at $m/z \\approx 179.0345$.\n\n-   **Theoretical mass of the chloride-35 adduct $[M + {}^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}]^{-}$:**\n    $$m([M + {}^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}]^{-}) = m(M) + m(^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}) = 180.042275\\,\\mathrm{u} + 34.968853\\,\\mathrm{u} = 215.011128\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n    This matches the observed peak at $m/z \\approx 215.0111$.\n\nThe problem provides a clear and scientifically correct set of rules (\"fundamental bases\") and data that are internally consistent. The problem is well-posed and scientifically valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided premises.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nWe must predict the mass shifts for the two ions based on the provided \"fundamental bases\".\n\n1.  **Behavior of the Deprotonated Ion $[M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}$**\n    -   The initial peak at $m/z \\approx 179.0345$ is $[M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}$. This ion is the stable conjugate base, let's call it `A-`.\n    -   In the absence of $\\mathrm{D_2O}$, it is formed from the neutral acid `AH`: `AH -> A- + H+`.\n    -   In the presence of $\\mathrm{D_2O}$, the neutral acid `AH` rapidly exchanges its proton to become `AD`.\n    -   Ionization of `AD` then occurs: `AD -> A- + D+`.\n    -   The final detected ion is `A-` in both cases. Its mass does not depend on the isotopic composition of the proton/deuteron that was removed.\n    -   Therefore, the peak at $m/z \\approx 179.0345$ is expected to remain at the same mass.\n\n2.  **Behavior of the Chloride Adduct $[M + \\mathrm{Cl}]^{-}$**\n    -   The initial peak at $m/z \\approx 215.0111$ is $[M + {}^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}]^{-}$. Here, `M` represents the neutral molecule `AH`. The adduct is `[AH + Cl]-`.\n    -   In the presence of $\\mathrm{D_2O}$, the neutral `AH` becomes `AD`.\n    -   The chloride adduct now forms with the deuterated neutral: `AD + Cl- -> [AD + Cl]-`.\n    -   The mass of the new adduct is $m(\\text{AD}) + m(\\text{Cl})$. The mass of the original adduct was $m(\\text{AH}) + m(\\text{Cl})$.\n    -   The mass shift, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is the mass difference between the new adduct and the old adduct:\n        $$\\Delta(m/z) = (m(\\text{AD}) + m(\\text{Cl})) - (m(\\text{AH}) + m(\\text{Cl})) = m(\\text{AD}) - m(\\text{AH})$$\n        This is simply the mass difference between the deuterated and protonated neutral molecule, which is $m(\\mathrm{D}) - m(\\mathrm{H})$.\n        $$\\Delta(m/z) = 2.014102\\,\\mathrm{u} - 1.007825\\,\\mathrm{u} = +1.006277\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\n    -   Therefore, the chloride adduct peak is expected to shift *up* in mass by approximately $1.0063\\,\\mathrm{u}$. The new mass will be $215.011128 + 1.006277 = 216.017405\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    The H/D exchange experiment provides a clear distinction: the deprotonated ion peak does not shift, while the chloride adduct peak shifts to a higher mass by $\\approx 1.0063\\,\\mathrm{u}$. This differential behavior allows for unambiguous identification.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The $[M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ peak at $m/z \\approx 179.0345$ remains at the same mass. The chloride adduct peak at $m/z \\approx 215.0111$ shifts up by $m(\\mathrm{D}) - m(\\mathrm{H}) \\approx +1.0063\\,\\mathrm{u}$ to $m/z \\approx 216.0174$. The differential shift (one peak moves, one does not) distinguishes the ion types.**\n-   This option correctly states that the $[M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ peak does not shift.\n-   It correctly states that the chloride adduct peak shifts up by the mass difference between D and H.\n-   The calculated new mass ($216.017405\\,\\mathrm{u}$) matches the value given in the option ($216.0174\\,\\mathrm{u}$).\n-   This option accurately describes the phenomena as dictated by the correct physical principles of H/D exchange in negative ESI for a molecule with one labile proton.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The $[M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ peak shifts down by $\\approx 1.0063\\,\\mathrm{u}$ to $m/z \\approx 178.0282$, while the chloride adduct peak remains unchanged. The downward shift identifies the deprotonated species.**\n-   This is incorrect. The $[M - \\mathrm{H}]^{-}$ peak for a molecule with one acidic proton does not shift, and the adduct peak does. This option has both the direction and the moving species wrong.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both peaks shift up by $\\approx 1.0063\\,\\mathrm{u}$ because both the deprotonated ion and the adduct incorporate a deuteron. Since both move, they cannot be distinguished.**\n-   This is incorrect. The deprotonated ion peak does not shift.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both peaks cluster with a single $\\mathrm{D_{2}O}$ molecule, shifting by $+20.0276\\,\\mathrm{u}$. Since both move by the same amount, they cannot be distinguished.**\n-   While clustering can occur, it is a different phenomenon from H/D exchange, which is the focus of the problem. Effective H/D exchange experiments are typically run under conditions that minimize clustering.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3714824"}]}
