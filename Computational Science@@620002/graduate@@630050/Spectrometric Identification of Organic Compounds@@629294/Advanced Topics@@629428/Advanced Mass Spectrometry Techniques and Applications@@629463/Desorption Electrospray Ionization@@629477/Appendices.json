The analysis may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires analyzing the ionization behavior of three analytes ($A$, $B$, $N$) under two different solvent additive conditions.\n\n**Condition 1: Spray Solvent with $0.1\\%$ Formic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the $pH$ of the microdroplets.\nGiven: $K_a \\approx 1.8\\times 10^{-4}$ for formic acid, and its concentration $C_{\\mathrm{FA}} \\approx 0.025\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe proton concentration is given by $[\\mathrm{H}^+] \\approx \\sqrt{K_a C_{\\mathrm{FA}}}$.\n$$[\\mathrm{H}^+] \\approx \\sqrt{(1.8\\times 10^{-4}) \\times (0.025)} = \\sqrt{4.5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 2.12 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe $pH$ is then:\n$$pH = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^+]) \\approx -\\log_{10}(2.12 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 2.67$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the state of each analyte at this $pH$:\n-   **Amine $A$ (conjugate acid $pK_a=7.5$)**: The relevant equilibrium is $A\\mathrm{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons A + \\mathrm{H}^+$. Since the $pH$ of $2.67$ is much lower than the $pK_a$ of $7.5$, the equilibrium is strongly shifted to the left. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the conjugate acid:\n    $$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right)$$\n    $$2.67 = 7.5 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right)$$\n    $$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right) = 2.67 - 7.5 = -4.83$$\n    $$\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]} = 10^{-4.83} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n    This indicates that the amine is almost completely protonated (over $99.99\\%$). This is \"near-quantitative protonation\", leading to a strong signal for $[A+\\mathrm{H}]^+$ in positive-ion mode.\n\n-   **Carboxylic acid $B$ ($pK_a=4.5$)**: The equilibrium is $B\\mathrm{H} \\rightleftharpoons B^- + \\mathrm{H}^+$. Since the $pH$ of $2.67$ is lower than the $pK_a$ of $4.5$, the equilibrium is shifted to the left (protonated, neutral form).\n    $$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right)$$\n    $$2.67 = 4.5 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right)$$\n    $$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right) = 2.67 - 4.5 = -1.83$$\n    $$\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]} = 10^{-1.83} \\approx 0.0148$$\n    Only about $1.5\\%$ of the carboxylic acid is deprotonated. The signal for the deprotonated ion, $[B-\\mathrm{H}]^-$, would be strongly suppressed in negative-ion mode.\n\n**Condition 2: Spray Solvent with $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ Ammonium Acetate**\n\nThe $pH$ is given as $pH \\approx 6.9$.\n\n-   **Amine $A$ (conjugate acid $pK_a=7.5$)**: At $pH = 6.9$, which is below the $pK_a$:\n    $$6.9 = 7.5 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right) \\implies \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}\\right) = -0.6$$\n    $$\\frac{[A]}{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]} = 10^{-0.6} \\approx 0.25$$\n    The fraction protonated is $\\frac{[A\\mathrm{H}^+]}{[A]+[A\\mathrm{H}^+]} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.25} = 0.8$, or $80\\%$. Protonation is significant but less complete than with formic acid.\n\n-   **Carboxylic acid $B$ ($pK_a=4.5$)**: At $pH = 6.9$, which is above the $pK_a$:\n    $$6.9 = 4.5 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right) \\implies \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]}\\right) = 2.4$$\n    $$\\frac{[B^-]}{[B\\mathrm{H}]} = 10^{2.4} \\approx 251$$\n    The carboxylic acid is almost completely deprotonated (approx. $99.6\\%$), leading to a strong $[B-\\mathrm{H}]^-$ signal.\n\n-   **Polyether $N$**:\n    -   In positive-ion mode, we compare the formation of $[N+\\mathrm{Na}]^+$ and $[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$. The relative abundance of these adducts is proportional to the product of the binding constant and the cation concentration.\n    -   For sodium adduct: $K_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^+] = (5.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1})(5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 2.5 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n    -   For ammonium adduct: $K_{\\mathrm{NH}_4}[\\mathrm{NH}_4^+] = (1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 10$.\n    -   Ratio of adducts: $\\frac{[[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+]}{[[N+\\mathrm{Na}]^+]} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{NH}_4}[\\mathrm{NH}_4^+]}{K_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^+]} = \\frac{10}{2.5 \\times 10^{-2}} = 400$.\n    -   The ammonium adduct is overwhelmingly favored ($400$ times more abundant) because the much higher concentration of $\\mathrm{NH}_4^+$ more than compensates for its lower binding constant.\n    -   In negative-ion mode, the additive is ammonium acetate, providing a source of acetate ions ($\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}^-$). The problem states that $[N+\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}]^-$ adducts can form. Thus, their appearance is expected under this condition.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under $0.1\\%$ formic acid in positive-ion mode, $A$ exhibits near-quantitative protonation, increasing $[A+\\mathrm{H}]^+$, whereas in negative-ion mode $B$ shows suppressed $[B-\\mathrm{H}]^-$ due to low $pH$.**\n- Our calculation showed that at $pH \\approx 2.67$, amine $A$ ($pK_a=7.5$) is $>99.99\\%$ protonated, which is \"near-quantitative\". This enhances the $[A+\\mathrm{H}]^+$ signal.\n- Our calculation also showed that at this low $pH$, carboxylic acid $B$ ($pK_a=4.5$) is only $\\approx 1.5\\%$ deprotonated, meaning the $[B-\\mathrm{H}]^-$ signal is suppressed.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ ammonium acetate in positive-ion mode, $N$ forms predominantly $[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$ rather than $[N+\\mathrm{Na}]^+$ despite $K_{\\mathrm{NH}_4} < K_{\\mathrm{Na}}$.**\n- It is given that $K_{\\mathrm{NH}_4} (1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}) < K_{\\mathrm{Na}} (5.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1})$.\n- Our calculation of the adduct ratio, $\\frac{[[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+]}{[[N+\\mathrm{Na}]^+]} = 400$, confirms that the $[N+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$ adduct is predominant. The huge excess in ammonium concentration ($[\\mathrm{NH}_4^+] = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ vs. $[\\mathrm{Na}^+] = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) is the decisive factor.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In negative-ion mode with $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ ammonium acetate, $B$ is more deprotonated than with $0.1\\%$ formic acid, and acetate adducts $[N+\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}]^-$ may appear for $N$.**\n- With ammonium acetate ($pH \\approx 6.9$), analyte $B$ is $\\approx 99.6\\%$ deprotonated. With formic acid ($pH \\approx 2.67$), it is only $\\approx 1.5\\%$ deprotonated. Thus, $B$ is indeed more deprotonated with ammonium acetate.\n- The solvent contains a high concentration of acetate ions, and the problem statements allow for the formation of $[N+\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}]^-$ adducts. It is therefore entirely reasonable that they may appear.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Adding $0.1\\%$ formic acid leads to enhanced acetate adducts $[N+\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}]^-$ in negative mode.**\n- To form acetate adducts, acetate ions ($\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{COO}^-$) must be present. The additive is formic acid ($\\mathrm{HCOOH}$), which does not contain any acetate. This statement is chemically impossible under the given conditions.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In positive-ion mode, ammonium acetate reduces $[A+\\mathrm{H}]^+$ because ammonium ions outcompete protons for charge, driving $A$ to the neutral form; thus $[A+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$ replaces $[A+\\mathrm{H}]^+$.**\n- The reasoning provided is flawed. The fraction of protonated amine, $[A\\mathrm{H}^+]$, is lower with ammonium acetate ($80\\%$) than with formic acid ($>99.9\\%$), but this is because the $pH$ is higher ($6.9$ vs. $2.67$). Ammonium ions do not \"outcompete protons for charge\" to deprotonate $A\\mathrm{H}^+$. The $pK_a$ of $\\mathrm{NH}_4^+$ is $\\approx 9.25$, while the $pK_a$ for $A\\mathrm{H}^+$ is $7.5$. This means $A$ is a stronger base than $\\mathrm{NH}_3$, so the reaction $A + \\mathrm{NH}_4^+ \\rightleftharpoons A\\mathrm{H}^+ + \\mathrm{NH}_3$ favors the products. The explanation is incorrect.\n- The species $[A+\\mathrm{NH}_4]^+$ suggests an adduct between a neutral amine $A$ and an ammonium ion, which is not a standard or plausible ion observed for amines under these conditions. Protonation to $[A+\\mathrm{H}]^+$ is the dominant process.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3699099"}, {"introduction": "The core promise of high-resolution mass spectrometry is the ability to determine an unknown's elemental composition from its exact mass.

Preliminary checks show that the three measured $m/z$ values yield highly concordant masses for the neutral molecule $M$, confirming the data's integrity. The problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe first step is to determine the experimental mass of the neutral molecule, $m(M)_{\\text{exp}}$, from each of the three observed ion peaks. Since the charge $z$ is given as $1$, the measured $m/z$ value is numerically equal to the ion's mass in Daltons.\n\n1.

The two methods explored are the dependence of signal intensity on surface concentration and the fragmentation behavior under collision-induced dissociation (CID).\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation from First Principles\n\nFirst, let us analyze the expected behavior of each species based on fundamental chemical and physical principles.\n\n**1. In-source Noncovalent Cluster $\\left[2A + H\\right]^+$**\n\n*   **Formation and Concentration Dependence:** An in-source cluster is, by definition, not present on the surface initially. It forms during the gas-phase or droplet-phase processes that occur after desorption and ionization. A common pathway for the formation of a protonated dimer cluster is the association of a protonated monomer with a neutral monomer:\n    $$ \\left[A + H\\right]^+ + A \\rightleftharpoons \\left[2A + H\\right]^+ $$\n    The rate of formation of the cluster, $R_f$, is governed by the law of mass action. Assuming this is an elementary bimolecular reaction, the rate is second-order overall, proportional to the concentrations of the reactants in the reaction volume (e.g., the desorbed plume or electrospray droplets).\n    $$ R_f = k_f \\left[ \\left[A + H\\right]^+ \\right] [A] $$\n    The concentration of the neutral analyte in the plume, $[A]$, and the protonated monomer, $\\left[ \\left[A + H\\right]^+ \\right]$, are both expected to be proportional to the initial surface concentration of the analyte, $C_A$. Let $[A] \\propto C_A$ and $\\left[ \\left[A + H\\right]^+ \\right] \\propto C_A$. The second proportionality is experimentally confirmed by the data for $I_1$. The intensity of the monomer signal, $I_1$, is a direct measure of the abundance of $\\left[ \\left[A + H\\right]^+ \\right]$. The data shows that as $C_A$ goes from $1$ to $3$ to $9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ (a ratio of $1:3:9$), $I_1$ goes from $1.0 \\times 10^6$ to $3.0 \\times 10^6$ to $9.1 \\times 10^6$ counts, which is a ratio of $1:3.0:9.1$. This is a clear linear relationship, $I_1 \\propto C_A$.\n\n    Therefore, the rate of formation of the dimer cluster, and consequently its steady-state concentration and measured intensity $I_2$, should be proportional to the product of the precursor concentrations:\n    $$ I_2 \\propto R_f \\propto \\left[ \\left[A + H\\right]^+ \\right] [A] \\propto C_A \\cdot C_A = C_A^2 $$\n    This predicts a quadratic, or superlinear, dependence of the cluster intensity on the initial surface concentration. Let's check this against the experimental data for $I_2$.\n    The nominal concentrations $C_A$ are in the ratio $1:3:9$.\n    The measured intensities $I_2$ are $1.1 \\times 10^4$, $9.8 \\times 10^4$, and $8.9 \\times 10^5$ counts.\n    The ratio of the intensities is $1.1 \\times 10^4 : 9.8 \\times 10^4 : 8.9 \\times 10^5$. Normalizing to the first value, we get $1 : \\frac{9.8}{1.1} : \\frac{8.9 \\times 10}{1.1}$, which is approximately $1 : 8.91 : 80.9$.\n    The theoretical ratio for a quadratic dependence ($C_A^2$) is $1^2 : 3^2 : 9^2 = 1 : 9 : 81$.\n    The experimental ratio $1 : 8.91 : 80.9$ is in excellent agreement with the theoretical quadratic dependence $1 : 9 : 81$.\n\n*   **Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) Behavior:** The cluster $\\left[2A + H\\right]^+$ is held together by noncovalent forces (e.g., hydrogen bonds, ion-dipole interactions, van der Waals forces). These forces are significantly weaker than the covalent bonds within the structure of the monomer $A$. Typical noncovalent interaction energies are on the order of $0.1-1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, whereas covalent bond energies are typically $2-5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ or more. In a CID experiment, the imparted collision energy is converted into internal energy, which causes the weakest bonds to break first. Therefore, at low collision energies, the noncovalent link between the two monomer units will break, leading to dissociation:\n    $$ \\left[2A + H\\right]^+ \\xrightarrow{\\text{CID}} \\left[A + H\\right]^+ + A $$\n    The mass spectrometer detects the ionic product, $\\left[A + H\\right]^+$. The experimental data shows that at a low collision energy of $10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, the $\\left[2A + H\\right]^+$ feature undergoes $>95\\%$ conversion to monomer ions, and the conversion is quantitative at $25\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This is characteristic of the dissociation of a weakly bound noncovalent complex.\n\n**2. Pre-existing Covalent Dimer $\\left[A\\!-\\!A + H\\right]^+$**\n\n*   **Concentration Dependence:** A pre-existing covalent dimer $A\\!-\\!A$ is an analyte on the surface just like the monomer $A$. Assuming that the instrument response is linear over the concentration range, the intensity of its protonated ion, $I_{A\\!-\\!A}$, should be directly proportional to its surface concentration, $C_{A\\!-\\!A}$:\n    $$ I_{A\\!-\\!A} \\propto C_{A\\!-\\!A} $$\n    This is a linear, first-order dependence. The control experiment confirms this, stating that the signal $\\left[A\\!-\\!A + H\\right]^+$ \"shows intensities scaling proportionally with $C_{A\\!-\\!A}$\". If the unknown feature were a covalent dimer present as an impurity or byproduct whose concentration is proportional to $C_A$, then its intensity $I_2$ would be expected to scale linearly with $C_A$, not quadratically. The observed quadratic scaling robustly refutes the covalent dimer hypothesis.\n\n*   **Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) Behavior:** The ion $\\left[A\\!-\\!A + H\\right]^+$ is a single, covalently-bonded molecule. Fragmentation requires breaking strong covalent bonds. This requires substantially more energy than dissociating a noncovalent cluster. Furthermore, the fragmentation pathways would involve cleavage of the covalent skeleton, producing a pattern of fragment ions characteristic of the molecule's structure. It is highly unlikely that the sole low-energy pathway would be a clean break into two intact monomer units. The control experiment confirms this: at $10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\left[A\\!-\\!A + H\\right]^+$ yields covalent bond cleavage fragments, not monomer ions. Even at higher energies, \"pairwise monomer ions are rare\". This behavior is in stark contrast to that of the observed $\\left[2A + H\\right]^+$ feature.\n\n**Summary of Discriminating Rules:**\n1.  **Intensity Scaling:** An in-source cluster exhibits an intensity that scales superlinearly (typically quadratically, $I \\propto C^2$) with analyte concentration. A pre-existing species exhibits an intensity that scales linearly ($I \\propto C$) with its own concentration.\n2.  **CID Fragmentation:** An in-source cluster, being noncovalently bound, dissociates at low collision energies into its constituent monomers. A covalent dimer, being held by strong covalent bonds, requires high collision energies to fragment and breaks apart into smaller covalent fragments, not typically into intact monomers.\n\nThe experimental data for the unknown feature perfectly align with the rules for an in-source cluster.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. An in-source cluster formed post-desorption will exhibit a superlinear dependence of $\\left[2A + H\\right]^+$ intensity on the monomer concentration, with an apparent scaling exponent near $2$, because the formation rate is second order in $[A]$; under low-to-moderate CID energies the cluster will dissociate predominantly into two $\\left[A + H\\right]^+$ ions due to low noncovalent binding energies, with a sharp drop in survival yield near a low threshold. A true covalent dimer will show $\\left[A\\!-\\!A + H\\right]^+$ intensity proportional to its own concentration and will require substantially higher CID energies to fragment, yielding covalent cleavage products rather than two monomer ions.**\nThis option correctly describes all key points. The scaling exponent near $2$ is correct and explained by second-order kinetics. The CID behavior (dissociation into monomers at low energy) is correctly attributed to weak noncovalent bonds. The description of the covalent dimer's behavior (linear scaling with its own concentration, high-energy fragmentation into covalent cleavage products) is also correct. All statements are consistent with our derivation and the provided data. The phrase \"two $\\left[A + H\\right]^+$ ions\" is a slight conceptual oversimplification of the detected products but correctly identifies the constituent units. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Both in-source clusters and true covalent dimers show monomer-like linear scaling of the higher $m/z$ feature with $C_A$; CID cannot reliably discriminate them because both predominantly produce two monomer ions at low energy.**\nThis option contradicts the data and first principles. The scaling for the cluster is quadratic, not linear. CID provides a very clear discrimination, as the covalent dimer does not produce monomer ions at low energy. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In-source clusters exhibit intensity independent of $C_A$ due to saturation of the desorption plume; CID requires higher collision energies to break noncovalent interactions than to cleave covalent bonds, so monomer pairs appear only for true covalent dimers.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple fronts. The intensity is strongly dependent on $C_A$, not independent. It incorrectly states that noncovalent bonds require more energy to break than covalent bonds, which is fundamentally wrong. It also incorrectly claims that monomer pairs appear for covalent dimers, which is the opposite of the experimental observation. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Both species show quadratic scaling of the higher $m/z$ feature with $C_A$ because dimeric entities are second order in $A$; CID yields indistinguishable patterns, so the isotopic fine structure is the only reliable discriminator.**\nThis option incorrectly claims that a pre-existing covalent dimer would show quadratic scaling; its signal should be linear with its own concentration. It also incorrectly claims that CID patterns are indistinguishable, whereas the problem demonstrates they are highly distinct and discriminating. The claim about isotopic fine structure being the *only* reliable discriminator is false, as isotopic patterns for $\\left[2A + H\\right]^+$ and $\\left[A\\!-\\!A + H\\right]^+$ would be identical. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3699038"}]}
