The dominant feature of a chlorine-containing compound's isotope pattern is the M+2 peak due to $^{37}\\mathrm{Cl}$. The relative intensity of the M+2 peak to the M peak is approximately the ratio of isotopic abundances:\n    $$ I_{M+2} \\approx \\frac{p(^{37}\\mathrm{Cl})}{p(^{35}\\mathrm{Cl})} = \\frac{0.2424}{0.7576} \\approx 0.3199 $$\n    The experimental $I_{M+2}$ value is $0.0180$. The predicted intensity for a chlorinated compound is over $17$ times larger than the observed intensity. This provides definitive evidence that the compound does not contain chlorine.\n\n**Pruning and Confirmation**\nCandidates $\\mathrm{F}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{F}_{3}$, and $\\mathrm{F}_{4}$ are decisively eliminated based on gross violation of the mass accuracy constraint. Candidate $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$ is the only one that satisfies both the accurate mass and isotopic pattern criteria. As only one candidate remains, the MS/MS data serve as confirmation rather than a tie-breaker.\n\n**MS/MS Fragmentation Analysis for $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$**\nThe precursor ion is $[M+\\mathrm{H}]^{+}$ with $m/z = m_{1} = 260.149252$.\nThe fragments are $f_{1} = 242.138684$ and $f_{2} = 216.159419$.\nWe calculate the neutral losses:\n-   Loss 1: $\\Delta_{1} = m_{1} - f_{1} = 260.149252 - 242.138684 = 18.010568$ Da.\n    The exact mass of water, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$, is $2 \\times m(^{1}\\mathrm{H}) + m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 2 \\times 1.007825032 + 15.994914620 = 18.010564684$ Da.\n    The observed loss $\\Delta_{1}$ corresponds to the loss of a water molecule. This is a chemically plausible fragmentation for a molecule with the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{12}\\mathrm{H}_{21}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_{5}$.\n\n-   Loss 2: $\\Delta_{2} = m_{1} - f_{2} = 260.149252 - 216.159419 = 43.989833$ Da.\n    The exact mass of carbon dioxide, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, is $m(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) + 2 \\times m(^{16}\\mathrm{O}) = 12.000000 + 2 \\times 15.994914620 = 43.98982924$ Da.\n    The observed loss $\\Delta_{2}$ corresponds to the loss of a carbon dioxide molecule. This is characteristic of a carboxylic acid, which is plausible for the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{12}\\mathrm{H}_{21}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_{5}$.\n\nThe MS/MS data provide strong corroborating evidence for the structure implied by formula $\\mathrm{F}_{1}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a rigorous, multi-faceted evaluation of the HRMS and MS/MS data, the formula $\\mathrm{F}_{1} = \\mathrm{C}_{12}\\mathrm{H}_{21}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_{5}$ is the only candidate consistent with all experimental observations. The monoisotopic neutral exact mass for this formula is $M_{1} = 259.141972777$ Da.\n\nThe problem requests this value rounded to six significant figures.\n$$ M_{1} \\approx 259.142 \\text{ Da} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{259.142}\n$$", "id": "3712381"}]}
