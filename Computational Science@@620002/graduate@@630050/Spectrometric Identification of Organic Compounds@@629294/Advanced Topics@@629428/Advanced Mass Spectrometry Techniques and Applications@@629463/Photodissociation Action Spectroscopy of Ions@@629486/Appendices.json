By co-trapping an analyte with a reference standard and measuring their relative depletion, you can determine the analyte's absolute cross-section, as we will explore by starting from the fundamental statistical nature of photon absorption [@problem_id:3718322].", "problem": "In a Photodissociation Action Spectroscopy (PDAS) experiment on mass-selected organic ions conducted in a quadrupole ion trap, a reference cation, denoted by species $\\mathrm{R}$, and an analyte cation, denoted by species $\\mathrm{A}$, are co-trapped and exposed simultaneously to the same train of identical laser pulses at photon energy corresponding to a fixed wavelength. The exposure conditions ensure that the ions experience the same effective photon fluence, denoted $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, integrated over the entire pulse train. The temporal spacing between pulses is long compared to vibrational cooling times, so that absorption events across pulses are independent. Parent ion depletion is quantified by the parent survival fraction, defined as the ratio of the parent ion signal with the laser on to that with the laser off for a fixed trapping time, denoted $S \\equiv I_{\\text{parent,on}}/I_{\\text{parent,off}}$.

The solution requires starting from the first principles of photon absorption as a Poisson process.\n\nFirst, we model the absorption of photons by a single ion. The problem states that ions are exposed to a train of laser pulses and that absorption events are independent. Under these conditions, the number of photons, $k$, absorbed by a single ion over the exposure time follows a Poisson distribution:\n$$P(k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the mean number of photons absorbed by the ion. This mean is directly proportional to the ion's absorption cross-section, $\\sigma$, and the effective photon fluence, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (in photons per unit area), to which the ion is exposed. The relationship is:\n$$\\lambda = \\sigma \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\n\nNext, we model the dissociation process. The dissociation quantum yield, $\\varphi$, is the probability that an ion dissociates upon the absorption of a single photon. Consequently, the probability that an ion *survives* the absorption of a single photon is $(1-\\varphi)$. The problem specifies that the time between laser pulses is long enough for vibrational cooling, so each photon absorption can be treated as an independent event. If an ion absorbs $k$ photons, its probability of surviving all $k$ independent events is $(1-\\varphi)^k$.\n\nThe overall probability of an ion surviving the entire laser exposure, which is the parent survival fraction $S$, is the sum of the probabilities of surviving for each possible number of absorbed photons, $k$. We must sum over all possible values of $k$ from $0$ to $\\infty$, weighted by the Poisson probability of absorbing $k$ photons:\n$$S = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(k) \\times (\\text{survival probability for } k \\text{ absorptions})$$\n$$S = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\\right) (1-\\varphi)^k$$\nWe can rearrange this expression by factoring out the $e^{-\\lambda}$ term:\n$$S = e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda(1-\\varphi))^k}{k!}$$\nThe summation is the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function $\\exp(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$, with $x = \\lambda(1-\\varphi)$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$S = e^{-\\lambda} \\exp(\\lambda(1-\\varphi)) = \\exp(-\\lambda + \\lambda(1-\\varphi)) = \\exp(-\\lambda + \\lambda - \\lambda\\varphi) = \\exp(-\\lambda\\varphi)$$\nThis equation, $S = \\exp(-\\lambda\\varphi)$, provides the fundamental relationship between the observable survival fraction $S$, the dissociation quantum yield $\\varphi$, and the mean number of absorbed photons $\\lambda$.\n\nWe can now express $\\lambda$ in terms of the experimental observables. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(S) = -\\lambda\\varphi$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ gives:\n$$\\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(S)}{\\varphi}$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = \\sigma \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we have:\n$$\\sigma \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = -\\frac{\\ln(S)}{\\varphi}$$\nThis equation holds for both the reference species, $\\mathrm{R}$, and the analyte species, $\\mathrm{A}$.

This allows us to eliminate $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ by taking the ratio of the two equations:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}} \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}} \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{- \\ln(S_{\\mathrm{A}})/\\varphi_{\\mathrm{A}}}{- \\ln(S_{\\mathrm{R}})/\\varphi_{\\mathrm{R}}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}}} = \\frac{\\ln(S_{\\mathrm{A}})}{\\ln(S_{\\mathrm{R}})} \\frac{\\varphi_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\varphi_{\\mathrm{A}}}$$\nFinally, we can solve for the unknown analyte absorption cross-section, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}} \\frac{\\varphi_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\varphi_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\frac{\\ln(S_{\\mathrm{A}})}{\\ln(S_{\\mathrm{R}})}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this expression:\n- $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}} = 1.35 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\text{cm}^{2}$\n- $\\varphi_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.80$\n- $S_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.55$\n- $\\varphi_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.65$\n- $S_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.72$\n\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}} = (1.35 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\text{cm}^2) \\times \\frac{0.80}{0.65} \\times \\frac{\\ln(0.72)}{\\ln(0.55)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the values of the natural logarithms and the ratio of quantum yields:\n$$\\ln(0.72) \\approx -0.328504$$\n$$\\ln(0.55) \\approx -0.597837$$\n$$\\frac{0.80}{0.65} \\approx 1.230769$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx (1.35 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\text{cm}^2) \\times (1.230769) \\times \\frac{-0.328504}{-0.597837}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx (1.35 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\text{cm}^2) \\times (1.230769) \\times (0.549530)$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx (1.35 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\text{cm}^2) \\times (0.676254)$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx 9.1294 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\text{cm}^2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{A}} = 9.13 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\text{cm}^2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.13 \\times 10^{-18}}$$", "id": "3718322"}, {"introduction": "While using a reference is elegant, performing an absolute measurement from first principles provides a deeper understanding of the experiment.
