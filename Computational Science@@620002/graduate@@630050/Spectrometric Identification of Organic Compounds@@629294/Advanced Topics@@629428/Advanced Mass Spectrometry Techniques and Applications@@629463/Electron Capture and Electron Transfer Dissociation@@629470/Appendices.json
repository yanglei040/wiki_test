This energy is defined as the energy released upon electron capture minus the electron affinity of the reagent anion.\n\nThe energy released upon electron capture is modeled as the magnitude of the Coulomb potential energy, $U$, between the peptide cation and the electron at the capture radius $r_0$. The Coulomb potential energy between two point charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$, separated by a distance $r$ in a vacuum is given by:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r}\n$$\nIn this case, the peptide has a charge $q_1 = +3e$ and the electron has a charge $q_2 = -e$. The separation distance is the capture radius $r = r_0$. Substituting these into the equation gives:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(+3e)(-e)}{r_0} = -\\frac{3e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_0}\n$$\nThe problem states that the energy released, which we denote as $E_{\\text{capture}}$, is the magnitude of this potential energy. The negative sign of $U$ indicates that the system is attractive and energy is released as the electron approaches the cation.\n$$\nE_{\\text{capture}} = |U| = \\frac{3e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_0}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the given values to calculate $E_{\\text{capture}}$ in SI units (Joules):\n$e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ C\n$\\epsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}$ F m$^{-1}$\n$r_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n$$\nE_{\\text{capture}} = \\frac{3 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{4\\pi \\times (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-9})} \\text{ J}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{capture}} \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 2.566970 \\times 10^{-38}}{1.112650 \\times 10^{-10} \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}} \\text{ J}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{capture}} \\approx \\frac{7.70091 \\times 10^{-38}}{1.11265 \\times 10^{-19}} \\text{ J} \\approx 6.92147 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in electron volts (eV).

The problem provides an estimated energy barrier range for N–Cα bond cleavage of $0.3$–$0.6$ eV.\nComparing our result, we see that $3.320 \\text{ eV} > 0.6 \\text{ eV}$. The net energy significantly exceeds the upper end of the estimated activation energy barrier for N–Cα bond cleavage.\n\nQualitatively, this result demonstrates how Coulomb attraction makes ETD a feasible and effective dissociation method, particularly for multiply charged peptides. The core mechanism is as follows:\n1.  **Strong Electrostatic Attraction:** The Coulomb force between a multiply charged cation (like the $+3$ peptide) and an electron is very strong. The potential energy, and thus the energy released upon capture, is directly proportional to the cation's charge state ($E_{\\text{capture}} \\propto q_1$).\n2.  **Large Energy Deposition:** This strong attraction leads to a large release of recombination energy when the electron is transferred to the peptide. In this model, the energy released is $4.320$ eV. This substantial amount of energy is deposited into the peptide's internal modes almost instantaneously.\n3.  **Driving Fragmentation:** Even after subtracting the energy required to generate the free electron from the reagent anion (its electron affinity, $1.0$ eV), the remaining net energy ($3.320$ eV) is very high. This energy is more than sufficient to overcome the activation barriers of various fragmentation pathways, including the cleavage of the peptide backbone at the N–Cα bond, which is characteristic of ETD.\nFor a lower charge state, such as $+1$, the capture energy would be only one-third as large ($\\approx 1.44$ eV), yielding a net energy of only $\\approx 0.44$ eV. While this might still be sufficient to induce cleavage, the process would be far less energetic and likely less efficient. The high charge state of the precursor ion is therefore a critical factor for the success of ETD, as it ensures a large exothermicity for the electron capture step, providing a powerful driving force for dissociation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.320}\n$$", "id": "3700202"}, {"introduction": "One of the most immediate events in ECD or ETD is the reduction of the precursor ion's charge state, which can be observed directly in the mass spectrum.

The problem is complete, consistent, and does not violate any fundamental principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the $m/z$ Expression\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$, is defined as the mass of an ion, $m$, divided by its integer charge number, $z$.\n\nFirst, consider the precursor ion, $\\left[M + zH\\right]^{z+}$.\nThe mass of this ion, $m_{precursor}$, is the sum of the monoisotopic mass of the neutral molecule, $M$, and the masses of the $z$ protons that have been added. The problem provides the mass of a proton as $m_{\\mathrm{p}}$.\n$$m_{precursor} = M + z \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{p}}$$\nThe charge number of the precursor ion is $z$.\nThus, the mass-to-charge ratio of the precursor is:\n$$(m/z)_{precursor} = \\frac{m_{precursor}}{z} = \\frac{M + z \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{p}}}{z}$$\n\nNext, consider the charge-reduced species, $\\left[M + zH\\right]^{(z-1)+\\cdot}$, which is formed when the precursor ion captures a single electron.\nThe mass of this product ion, $m_{product}$, is the mass of the precursor ion plus the mass of one electron, $m_{e}$.\n$$m_{product} = m_{precursor} + m_{e} = M + z \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{p}} + m_{e}$$\nThe problem states that the electron's mass can be considered negligible. Therefore, we make the approximation $m_{e} \\approx 0$.\n$$m_{product} \\approx M + z \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{p}}$$\nThis approximation is consistent with the problem's stipulation that the elemental composition remains $\\left[M + zH\\right]$.\nThe capture of one electron reduces the ion's net positive charge by one. The new charge number is $z-1$.\nThe mass-to-charge ratio of the charge-reduced species is therefore:\n$$(m/z)_{product} = \\frac{m_{product}}{z-1} \\approx \\frac{M + z \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{p}}}{z-1}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the $m/z$ of the charge-reduced species.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $M = 5432.123456\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n-   $z = 7$\n-   $m_{\\mathrm{p}} = 1.00727646688\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the mass of the ion, which is identical for both the precursor and the product under the given assumptions.\n$$m_{ion} = M + z \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{p}} = 5432.123456 + 7 \\times 1.00727646688$$\n$$m_{ion} = 5432.123456 + 7.05093526816 = 5439.17439126816\\,\\mathrm{u}$$\nThe charge number of the product species is $z' = z-1 = 7-1 = 6$.\nNow, we can compute the $m/z$ value for the product species:\n$$(m/z)_{product} = \\frac{m_{ion}}{z'} = \\frac{5439.17439126816}{6}$$\n$$(m/z)_{product} = 906.52906521136...$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to seven significant figures. The first seven significant figures are $9, 0, 6, 5, 2, 9, 0$. The eighth significant figure is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the seventh digit. The seventh digit, $0$, becomes $1$.\n$$(m/z)_{product} \\approx 906.5291$$\n\n### Isotopic Peak Spacing and Envelope Width\nThe isotopic peaks in a mass spectrum arise from the natural abundance of heavy isotopes (e.g., $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, $^{2}\\mathrm{H}$). The mass difference, $\\Delta m$, between adjacent isotopic peaks (e.g., differing by one $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ vs. $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$) is approximately constant, with $\\Delta m \\approx 1.00\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n\nThe spacing of these peaks in the $m/z$ domain, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is this mass difference divided by the charge number of the ion, $z_{charge}$:\n$$\\Delta(m/z) = \\frac{\\Delta m}{z_{charge}}$$\nFor the precursor ion, with charge $z$, the isotopic peak spacing is:\n$$\\Delta(m/z)_{precursor} \\approx \\frac{1.00\\,\\mathrm{u}}{z}$$\nFor the charge-reduced product ion, with charge $z-1$, the spacing is:\n$$\\Delta(m/z)_{product} \\approx \\frac{1.00\\,\\mathrm{u}}{z-1}$$\nSince the ion is multiply charged, $z > 1$, which implies $z-1  z$. Consequently, $\\frac{1}{z-1} > \\frac{1}{z}$. This means that $\\Delta(m/z)_{product} > \\Delta(m/z)_{precursor}$. Therefore, upon charge reduction, the spacing between adjacent isotopic peaks will **increase**.\n\nThe apparent width of the entire isotopic envelope in the $m/z$ domain follows the same logic. Let $\\Delta M_{total}$ be the mass difference between the lightest and heaviest significant isotopologues in the distribution. This mass range is an intrinsic property of the ion's elemental formula and does not change with charge state. The width of the envelope in the spectrum, $W$, is given by:\n$$W = \\frac{\\Delta M_{total}}{z_{charge}}$$\nFor the precursor, the width is $W_{precursor} = \\frac{\\Delta M_{total}}{z}$. For the product, the width is $W_{product} = \\frac{\\Delta M_{total}}{z-1}$.\nSince $z-1  z$, it follows directly that $W_{product} > W_{precursor}$.
