The data are sufficient and internally consistent.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, unambiguous technical language. All values are given to a high degree of precision, as is typical for high-resolution mass spectrometry data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be developed.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the expression for z**\n\nFrom the definition provided, the mass-to-charge ratio for the two observed peaks can be expressed as follows:\nFor the peak at $m/z_1$ with charge state $z$:\n$$m/z_1 = \\frac{M + z m_p}{z} \\quad (1)$$\n\nFor the peak at $m/z_2$ with charge state $z-1$:\n$$m/z_2 = \\frac{M + (z-1) m_p}{z-1} \\quad (2)$$\n\nTo find an expression for $z$, we must eliminate the neutral mass $M$. We begin by rearranging both equations to solve for $M$.\nFrom equation (1):\n$$z (m/z_1) = M + z m_p$$\n$$M = z (m/z_1) - z m_p = z(m/z_1 - m_p)$$\n\nFrom equation (2):\n$$(z-1)(m/z_2) = M + (z-1) m_p$$\n$$M = (z-1)(m/z_2) - (z-1) m_p = (z-1)(m/z_2 - m_p)$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $M$, we obtain:\n$$z(m/z_1 - m_p) = (z-1)(m/z_2 - m_p)$$\n\nWe expand this equation to solve for $z$:\n$$z(m/z_1) - z m_p = z(m/z_2) - (m/z_2) - z m_p + m_p$$\n\nThe term $-z m_p$ cancels from both sides:\n$$z(m/z_1) = z(m/z_2) - (m/z_2) + m_p$$\n\nNext, we collect all terms involving $z$ on one side of the equation:\n$$(m/z_2) - m_p = z(m/z_2) - z(m/z_1)$$\n$$(m/z_2) - m_p = z((m/z_2) - (m/z_1))$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $z$ to arrive at the explicit expression:\n$$z = \\frac{(m/z_2) - m_p}{(m/z_2) - (m/z_1)}$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of z and M**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula for $z$.\n- $m/z_1 = 12501.007276$\n- $m/z_2 = 13637.37091236$\n- $m_p = 1.007276$\n\nFirst, we compute the numerator:\n$$(m/z_2) - m_p = 13637.37091236 - 1.007276 = 13636.36363636$$\n\nNext, we compute the denominator:\n$$(m/z_2) - (m/z_1) = 13637.37091236 - 12501.007276 = 1136.36363636$$\n\nNow, we calculate $z$:\n$$z = \\frac{13636.36363636}{1136.36363636} = 12$$\n\nThe charge state $z$ is an integer, $12$, which is a physically consistent result.

It provides all necessary information to derive the required expressions and calculate the dissociation constant, $K_d$. All data and premises are physically and chemically plausible for a native mass spectrometry experiment studying protein-ligand binding. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe first step is to derive the single-site occupancy probability, $p$, in terms of the free ligand concentration, $[B]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$. The probability $p$ is defined as the fraction of binding sites that are occupied by the ligand. Let $\\mathrm{E}$ denote an empty binding site and $\\mathrm{EB}$ denote a bound site.

This scenario is described by a sequence of $N$ Bernoulli trials, where each trial corresponds to the state of a binding site (either bound or unbound). The probability of \"success\" (a site being bound) is $p$, and the probability of \"failure\" (a site being unbound) is $1-p$. The probability of observing exactly $n$ successes in $N$ trials is given by the binomial distribution:\n$$P(n) = \\binom{N}{n} p^n (1-p)^{N-n}$$\nFor this specific problem, the number of sites is $N=4$, so the probability of having $n$ ligands bound to the protein is:\n$$P(n) = \\binom{4}{n} p^n (1-p)^{4-n}, \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n\nThe final step is to determine the value of $K_d$. We are given that the measured relative intensities, $I_n$, are equal to the occupancy probabilities, $P(n)$. We can use the experimental data to estimate the parameter $p$. A statistically robust method is to calculate the experimental average number of bound ligands, $\\langle n \\rangle$, and equate it to the theoretical mean of the binomial distribution, which is $N p$.\nThe experimental average occupancy is calculated as:\n$$\\langle n \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{4} n \\cdot I_n$$\nUsing the provided intensity data:\n- $I_0 = 0.089$\n- $I_1 = 0.296$\n- $I_2 = 0.368$\n- $I_3 = 0.205$\n- $I_4 = 0.042$\nWe calculate $\\langle n \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle n \\rangle = (0 \\times 0.089) + (1 \\times 0.296) + (2 \\times 0.368) + (3 \\times 0.205) + (4 \\times 0.042)$$\n$$\\langle n \\rangle = 0 + 0.296 + 0.736 + 0.615 + 0.168 = 1.815$$\nNow we relate this to the theoretical mean for $N=4$:\n$$\\langle n \\rangle = Np \\implies 1.815 = 4p$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{1.815}{4} = 0.45375$$\nNow we can use the derived relationship between $p$, $[B]$, and $K_d$ to find $K_d$.

Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nLet $M_P$ be the mass of the protein monomer $P$, and $M_L$ be the mass of the ligand $L$.\nThe two hypotheses for the precursor complex are:\n1.  A trimer with three ligands, $(3P+3L)$, with total neutral mass $M_{(3P+3L)} = 3M_P + 3M_L$.\n2.  A tetramer with one ligand, $(4P+1L)$, with total neutral mass $M_{(4P+1L)} = 4M_P + M_L$.\n\nThe problem states that these masses are ambiguous within experimental uncertainty, i.e., $3M_P + 3M_L \\approx 4M_P + M_L$. This implies a physicochemical constraint that $M_P \\approx 2M_L$. A precursor ion of charge $z$ is isolated. Its mass-to-charge ratio, $(m/z)_{\\text{precursor}}$, is therefore also ambiguous. The task is to select the experimental strategy that most directly and unambiguously resolves this ambiguity.\n\nAnalysis of the options:\n\nA. Isolate a single precursor charge state $z$ and apply low-energy CID to record a ladder of product ions corresponding to sequential ligand ejections. Use the discrete step size in $m/z$ per ligand loss and the maximum number of ligand-loss steps observed before any monomer dissociation to deduce the ligand stoichiometry of the precursor.\n\nThis strategy employs tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The precursor ion, let's denote it as $[C]^{z+}$, is isolated and activated by collisions. The problem states that gentle CID causes the weakest interactions to dissociate first. In a noncovalent protein-ligand complex, the protein-ligand bonds are typically weaker than the protein-protein intradimer or interdimer bonds, which are in turn much weaker than the covalent bonds of the polypeptide backbone.\n- If the precursor is $[3P+3L]^{z+}$, gentle CID will sequentially eject the three ligands. Since ejection is neutral, the charge $z$ is retained by the remaining complex. This produces a series of product ions:\n$$[3P+3L]^{z+} \\xrightarrow{-\\text{L}^0} [3P+2L]^{z+} \\xrightarrow{-\\text{L}^0} [3P+L]^{z+} \\xrightarrow{-\\text{L}^0} [3P]^{z+}$$\nThe mass spectrum will show a \"ladder\" of peaks, each separated by a mass difference corresponding to one ligand, $M_L$. The difference in mass-to-charge ratio between adjacent peaks in this series will be $\\Delta(m/z) = M_L/z$. Observing up to **three** such sequential loss steps provides a direct count of the dissociable ligands.\n- If the precursor is $[4P+1L]^{z+}$, there is only one ligand to dissociate via this low-energy pathway:\n$$[4P+L]^{z+} \\xrightarrow{-\\text{L}^0} [4P]^{z+}$$\nThe spectrum would show only **one** neutral loss of $M_L$. Further fragmentation would require higher energy to eject a monomer, which is a distinct process.\nThis method directly counts the number of ligand components, providing an integer result ($1$ versus $3$) that directly and unambiguously differentiates the two hypotheses. The measurement is based on the fundamental principles of dissociation and $m/z$ relationships.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Use IM-MS to measure the collisional cross section $\\Omega$ of the precursor and infer oligomeric state by scaling arguments (e.g., $\\Omega \\propto n^{2/3}$ for compact, similarly shaped $n$-mers), concluding trimer versus tetramer based on the magnitude of $\\Omega$ at similar total mass.\n\nThis strategy uses ion mobility to probe the shape and size of the precursor ion. The collisional cross section, $\\Omega$, is a measure of the effective area the ion presents to the buffer gas. While it is true that for simple, spherical homo-oligomers, $\\Omega$ tends to scale with mass $M$ as $\\Omega \\propto M^{2/3}$ (and thus with oligomeric state $n$ as $\\Omega \\propto n^{2/3}$), this is a scaling law, not a first principle applicable to any complex. Here, we are comparing two different complexes, $(3P+3L)$ and $(4P+1L)$, which happen to have similar total mass. Their shapes are unknown. The $(3P+3L)$ complex could be more compact or more extended than the $(4P+1L)$ complex, depending on the specific protein architecture and ligand binding sites. Inferring oligomeric state ($3$ vs $4$) from a single $\\Omega$ value at a similar mass is an act of interpretation, not a direct measurement. It relies on unstated assumptions about the gas-phase structures. A small difference in $\\Omega$ may fall within the experimental uncertainty (\"a few percent\"). This method is indirect and not unambiguous.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Compare the precursor charge-state distribution across native buffers to assign oligomeric state, assuming larger oligomers carry proportionally more charge due to increased surface area at similar mass.\n\nThis strategy relies on the observation that in native electrospray ionization, the maximum charge an ion acquires often correlates with its solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). The argument assumes that the tetrameric complex $(4P+1L)$ will have a larger SASA than the trimeric complex $(3P+3L)$ and thus exhibit a charge state distribution shifted to higher values of $z$. This is a heuristic, not a fundamental law. As with option B, we have no *a priori* knowledge of the relative compactness or surface area of the two candidate complexes. The distribution of charged residues on the surface, buffer pH, and other solution conditions heavily influence the charge state distribution, confounding any simple relationship with oligomeric state. This method is even more indirect and less reliable than measuring $\\Omega$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Rely on high-resolution isotope fine structure of the unlabeled precursor to count the number of ligands by parsing the natural-abundance $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$-driven mass defect and associating the aggregate pattern uniquely with three versus one ligand at similar total mass.\n\nThis strategy proposes using ultra-high mass resolution to analyze the isotopic pattern of the precursor ion. The elemental composition of $(3P+3L)$ is different from that of $(4P+1L)$. This difference would, in theory, manifest as a slightly different exact mass and a different isotopic distribution (e.g., different ratio of $(M+1)/M$ peak intensities, different mass defects). However, for large biomolecular complexes (likely $>100$ kDa in this case, since $M_P \\approx 2M_L$), the isotopic envelope is extremely broad and complex, consisting of thousands of individual isotopologues. \"Parsing the fine structure\" to deconvolve the contribution of one versus three ligands from the overall pattern is an exceptionally difficult analytical challenge. It would require extraordinary mass resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, likely beyond the routine capabilities specified. More importantly, it is not a direct \"counting\" experiment in the way CID is. It is a complex deconvolution problem that relies on comparing an experimental spectrum to a theoretical model. This is neither direct nor unambiguous in a practical sense.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nConclusion:\nStrategy A provides the most direct and unambiguous differentiation. It is a counting experiment where the number of sequential ligand dissociation events directly corresponds to the ligand stoichiometry in the precursor ion. This is a clear, discrete signature rooted in the fundamental physics of gas-phase dissociation. The other methods rely on indirect correlations with analog properties (shape, surface area, isotopic pattern) and are subject to significant ambiguity and interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3714689"}]}
