The ideal gas law relates pressure $P$, volume $V$, and temperature $T$ to the number of molecules $N_{\\text{molecules}}$ via the Boltzmann constant $k_B$:\n$$PV = N_{\\text{molecules}} k_B T$$\nThe number density $N$ is defined as the number of molecules per unit volume, $N = \\frac{N_{\\text{molecules}}}{V}$. Rearranging the ideal gas law gives the symbolic dependence of the buffer gas number density on $P$ and $T$:\n$$N = \\frac{P}{k_B T}$$\nThis equation is valid for any state of the ideal gas. For the standard state, defined by pressure $P_0$ and temperature $T_0$, the number density is $N_0$:\n$$N_0 = \\frac{P_0}{k_B T_0}$$\nThe reduced mobility $K_0$ is defined by normalizing the experimentally measured mobility $K$ to this standard state. The mobility $K$ of an ion in a buffer gas is inversely proportional to the number density $N$ of the gas, as higher density leads to more frequent collisions that impede ion motion. This relationship can be expressed as $K \\propto \\frac{1}{N}$. Therefore, the product $K \\cdot N$ is a constant for a given ion and buffer gas, independent of temperature and pressure. Equating this product under experimental conditions ($K, N$) and standard conditions ($K_0, N_0$) gives:\n$$K_0 N_0 = K N$$\nFrom this definition, we can express $K_0$ as:\n$$K_0 = K \\frac{N}{N_0}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N$ and $N_0$ from the ideal gas law:\n$$K_0 = K \\frac{\\left(\\frac{P}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{P_0}{k_B T_0}\\right)}$$\nThe Boltzmann constant $k_B$ cancels, yielding the symbolic expression for $K_0$ in terms of $K$, $P$, $T$, $P_0$, and $T_0$:\n$$K_0 = K \\frac{P}{P_0} \\frac{T_0}{T}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Relative Uncertainty in Reduced Mobility**\n\nThe problem asks for the combined relative standard uncertainty in $K_0$, denoted as $\\frac{u_{K_0}}{K_0}$, that arises from the independent uncertainties in the measured pressure $P$ and temperature $T$.

It is free of contradictions, factual errors, and ambiguities that would prevent a rigorous solution.\n\n### Part (a): Derivation of Diffusion-Limited Resolving Power, $R_{\\mathrm{diff}}$\n\nThe diffusion-limited resolving power, $R_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, is defined as the ratio of the ion drift time, $t_d$, to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the arrival time distribution caused solely by diffusion, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\frac{t_d}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{diff}}}$$\nFirst, we express the drift time, $t_d$. An ion travels the length of the drift tube, $L$, at a constant drift velocity, $v_d$.\n$$t_d = \\frac{L}{v_d}$$\nThe drift velocity is given by $v_d = K E$, where $K$ is the ion mobility and $E$ is the electric field strength. For a uniform field, $E = U/L$, where $U$ is the total drift voltage.\n$$v_d = K \\frac{U}{L}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $t_d$ gives:\n$$t_d = \\frac{L}{K(U/L)} = \\frac{L^2}{KU}$$\nNext, we derive the temporal peak width due to diffusion, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{diff}}$.

The conversion from spatial standard deviation, $\\sigma_x$, to temporal standard deviation, $\\sigma_t$, is given by $\\sigma_t = \\sigma_x / v_d$. Therefore, the temporal variance due to diffusion is:\n$$\\sigma_{t, \\mathrm{diff}}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_x^2}{v_d^2} = \\frac{2 D t_d}{v_d^2}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we substitute $v_d = L/t_d$:\n$$\\sigma_{t, \\mathrm{diff}}^2 = \\frac{2 D t_d}{(L/t_d)^2} = \\frac{2 D t_d^3}{L^2}$$\nNow, we use the provided fundamental relations to replace $D$, $L$, and $t_d$.

The assigned calibrant value has a standard uncertainty $u_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ arising from prior metrological certification, which is treated as a Type B component with effectively infinite degrees of freedom.\n\nThe raw analyte CCS measurements (in square ångström units, $\\mathrm{\\AA}^2$) for days $i=1,\\dots,5$ and replicates $j=1,\\dots,4$ are:\n\nDay $1$: $167.12,\\ 166.98,\\ 167.08,\\ 167.00$\n\nDay $2$: $165.80,\\ 165.92,\\ 165.88,\\ 165.78$\n\nDay $3$: $166.61,\\ 166.52,\\ 166.49,\\ 166.58$\n\nDay $4$: $165.72,\\ 165.57,\\ 165.68,\\ 165.62$\n\nDay $5$: $166.40,\\ 166.31,\\ 166.37,\\ 166.33$\n\nThe calibrant measured CCS (in $\\mathrm{\\AA}^2$) for each day $i$ with $k=1,2,3$ replicates are:\n\nDay $1$: $150.83,\\ 150.77,\\ 150.89$\n\nDay $2$: $149.55,\\ 149.62,\\ 149.66$\n\nDay $3$: $150.28,\\ 150.33,\\ 150.36$\n\nDay $4$: $149.42,\\ 149.37,\\ 149.41$\n\nDay $5$: $150.13,\\ 150.07,\\ 150.12$\n\nThe assigned calibrant CCS and its standard uncertainty are\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{cal,ass}} = 150.000\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2, \\quad u_{\\mathrm{cal}} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2.\n$$\n\nAssume the following measurement model and statistical structure:\n- The day-specific instrumental drift is an additive offset that equally affects the analyte and the calibrant on a given day. You must correct each analyte replicate by subtracting the day’s calibrant bias $b_i = \\bar{c}_i - \\Omega_{\\mathrm{cal,ass}}$, where $\\bar{c}_i$ is the mean of the three calibrant replicates on day $i$.\n- After correction, model the corrected analyte replicates with a one-way random-effects structure: there is a between-day component with variance $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{day}}^2$ and a within-day repeatability component with variance $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rep}}^2$.\n- Treat the calibrant’s assigned CCS uncertainty $u_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ as a systematic uncertainty that is common to all corrected analyte measurements and does not average down with replication.\n\nUsing only well-established statistical principles for Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and uncertainty propagation, perform the following:\n1. Compute the corrected analyte CCS replicates for each day.\n2. From the corrected replicates, estimate the within-day mean square and the between-day mean square, and obtain estimates of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rep}}^2$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{day}}^2$.\n3.

Combine $u_{\\mathrm{rand}}$ with the systematic component $u_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ to obtain the combined standard uncertainty $u_c$ of the reported CCS mean, using the root-sum-of-squares law.\n5. Use the Welch–Satterthwaite approximation to determine the effective degrees of freedom for $u_c$ (treat $u_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ as having infinite degrees of freedom and $u_{\\mathrm{rand}}$ as having degrees of freedom equal to the within-day residual degrees of freedom).\n6.

The analysis involves correcting raw data for instrumental drift, applying a one-way random-effects Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model, and propagating uncertainties according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM).\n\nThe analysis proceeds in six steps as outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Data Correction**\n\nFirst, we correct the raw analyte CCS measurements, $x_{ij}$, for the day-specific instrumental drift. The drift is quantified by a bias term, $b_i$, calculated for each day $i$ from the mean of the calibrant replicates, $\\bar{c}_i$, and the assigned calibrant CCS, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{cal,ass}} = 150.000\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$. The formula for the bias is:\n$$\nb_i = \\bar{c}_i - \\Omega_{\\mathrm{cal,ass}}\n$$\nEach analyte replicate $x_{ij}$ is then corrected by subtracting this bias:\n$$\nx_{ij, \\mathrm{corr}} = x_{ij} - b_i\n$$\nThe calibrant means, biases, and the resulting corrected analyte replicates are calculated for each of the $d=5$ days.\n\n- **Day 1:**\n  - $\\bar{c}_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(150.83 + 150.77 + 150.89) = 150.83\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - $b_1 = 150.83 - 150.000 = 0.83\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - Corrected analyte data: $166.29, 166.15, 166.25, 166.17\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n\n- **Day 2:**\n  - $\\bar{c}_2 = \\frac{1}{3}(149.55 + 149.62 + 149.66) = 149.61\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - $b_2 = 149.61 - 150.000 = -0.39\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - Corrected analyte data: $166.19, 166.31, 166.27, 166.17\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n\n- **Day 3:**\n  - $\\bar{c}_3 = \\frac{1}{3}(150.28 + 150.33 + 150.36) \\approx 150.3233\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - $b_3 = 150.3233 - 150.000 = 0.3233\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - Corrected analyte data: $166.2867, 166.1967, 166.1667, 166.2567\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n\n- **Day 4:**\n  - $\\bar{c}_4 = \\frac{1}{3}(149.42 + 149.37 + 149.41) = 149.40\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - $b_4 = 149.40 - 150.000 = -0.60\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - Corrected analyte data: $166.32, 166.17, 166.28, 166.22\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n\n- **Day 5:**\n  - $\\bar{c}_5 = \\frac{1}{3}(150.13 + 150.07 + 150.12) \\approx 150.1067\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - $b_5 = 150.1067 - 150.000 = 0.1067\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n  - Corrected analyte data: $166.2933, 166.2033, 166.2633, 166.2233\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n\n**Step 2: ANOVA and Variance Component Estimation**\n\nWe perform a one-way random-effects ANOVA on the $d=5$ groups (days) of corrected analyte data, each with $r=4$ replicates. The total number of observations is $N = dr = 20$.\n\nFirst, we compute the mean for each day, $\\bar{x}_i$, and the grand mean, $\\bar{\\bar{x}}$:\n- $\\bar{x}_1 = 166.2150\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n- $\\bar{x}_2 = 166.2350\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n- $\\bar{x}_3 \\approx 166.2267\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n- $\\bar{x}_4 = 166.2475\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n- $\\bar{x}_5 \\approx 166.2458\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n- $\\bar{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=1}^d \\bar{x}_i \\approx 166.2340\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$\n\nNext, we calculate the Sum of Squares.\nThe Within-Day Sum of Squares ($SS_{\\mathrm{rep}}$), also called Sum of Squares for Error (SSE), is:\n$$\nSS_{\\mathrm{rep}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\sum_{j=1}^{r} (x_{ij, \\mathrm{corr}} - \\bar{x}_i)^2 \\approx 0.05315\n$$\nThe Between-Day Sum of Squares ($SS_{\\mathrm{day}}$), also called Sum of Squares for Treatments (SST), is:\n$$\nSS_{\\mathrm{day}} = r \\sum_{i=1}^{d} (\\bar{x}_i - \\bar{\\bar{x}})^2 \\approx 0.002952\n$$\nThe degrees of freedom are $df_{\\mathrm{day}} = d-1 = 4$ and $df_{\\mathrm{rep}} = d(r-1) = 5(4-1) = 15$.\n\nThe Mean Squares are:\n- Within-day Mean Square ($MS_{\\mathrm{rep}}$): $MS_{\\mathrm{rep}} = \\frac{SS_{\\mathrm{rep}}}{df_{\\mathrm{rep}}} = \\frac{0.05315}{15} \\approx 0.0035433$\n- Between-day Mean Square ($MS_{\\mathrm{day}}$): $MS_{\\mathrm{day}} = \\frac{SS_{\\mathrm{day}}}{df_{\\mathrm{day}}} = \\frac{0.002952}{4} \\approx 0.000738$\n\nThe variance components are estimated from the mean squares. The repeatability (within-day) variance, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rep}}^2$, is estimated by $MS_{\\mathrm{rep}}$. The between-day variance, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{day}}^2$, is estimated by $(MS_{\\mathrm{day}} - MS_{\\mathrm{rep}})/r$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\mathrm{rep}}^2 = MS_{\\mathrm{rep}} \\approx 0.0035433\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\mathrm{day}}^2 = \\frac{MS_{\\mathrm{day}} - MS_{\\mathrm{rep}}}{r} = \\frac{0.000738 - 0.0035433}{4} \\approx -0.000701\n$$\nSince a variance cannot be negative, this result indicates that the between-day variability is negligible compared to the within-day repeatability. Following standard ANOVA procedure, the estimate is truncated to zero:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\mathrm{day}}^2 = 0\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Standard Uncertainty from Random Effects ($u_{\\mathrm{rand}}$)**\n\nThe variance of the grand mean, $\\bar{\\bar{x}}$, in a balanced one-way random-effects model is given by:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{rand}}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{\\bar{x}}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{day}}^2}{d} + \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rep}}^2}{dr}\n$$\nSubstituting our estimates for the variance components:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{rand}}^2 = \\frac{0}{5} + \\frac{0.0035433}{5 \\times 4} = \\frac{0.0035433}{20} \\approx 0.00017717\n$$\nThe standard uncertainty due to random effects is the square root of this value:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{rand}} = \\sqrt{0.00017717} \\approx 0.01331\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Combined Standard Uncertainty ($u_c$)**\n\nThe combined standard uncertainty, $u_c$, is obtained by combining the random component ($u_{\\mathrm{rand}}$) and the systematic component from the calibrant's assigned value ($u_{\\mathrm{cal}} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$) using the root-sum-of-squares (RSS) law:\n$$\nu_c^2 = u_{\\mathrm{rand}}^2 + u_{\\mathrm{cal}}^2\n$$\n$$\nu_c^2 = 0.00017717 + (0.050)^2 = 0.00017717 + 0.0025 = 0.00267717\n$$\n$$\nu_c = \\sqrt{0.00267717} \\approx 0.05174\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Effective Degrees of Freedom ($v_{\\mathrm{eff}}$)**\n\nThe effective degrees of freedom for $u_c$ is calculated using the Welch–Satterthwaite approximation:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{u_c^4}{\\frac{u_{\\mathrm{rand}}^4}{v_{\\mathrm{rand}}} + \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{cal}}^4}{v_{\\mathrm{cal}}}}\n$$\nWe are given that $u_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ has infinite degrees of freedom ($v_{\\mathrm{cal}} = \\infty$), and we are instructed to use the within-day residual degrees of freedom for $u_{\\mathrm{rand}}$, so $v_{\\mathrm{rand}} = df_{\\mathrm{rep}} = 15$. The term with $v_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ becomes zero.\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{u_c^4 \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{rand}}}{u_{\\mathrm{rand}}^4} = \\frac{(0.00267717)^2 \\times 15}{(0.00017717)^2} \\approx \\frac{(7.1672 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 15}{3.1389 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 3425.3\n$$\nThe effective degrees of freedom is very large, which is expected as the total uncertainty is dominated by the calibrant uncertainty, which has infinite degrees of freedom.\n\n**Step 6: Expanded Uncertainty ($U$)**\n\nThe expanded uncertainty, $U$, is calculated as $U = k \\cdot u_c$, where $k$ is the two-sided $95\\%$ coverage factor from the Student's $t$-distribution with $v_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ degrees of freedom. For $v_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 3425$, the $t$-distribution is nearly identical to the normal distribution. The quantile $t_{0.975, 3425.3}$ is approximately $1.9606$.\n$$\nk \\approx 1.9606\n$$\nFinally, we compute the expanded uncertainty:\n$$\nU = k \\cdot u_c = 1.9606 \\times 0.05174 \\approx 0.10144\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the final result is $0.1014 \\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1014}\n$$", "id": "3708249"}]}
