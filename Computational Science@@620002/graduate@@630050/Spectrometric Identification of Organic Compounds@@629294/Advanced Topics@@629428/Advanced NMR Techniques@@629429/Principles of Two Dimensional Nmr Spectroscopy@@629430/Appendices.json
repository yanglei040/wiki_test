The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem provides the fundamental rule for this conversion, dictating the minimum sampling rate required to accurately capture a signal. This first practice challenges you to derive this relationship for the indirect dimension, connecting the experimental parameter of dwell time ($\\Delta t_1$) to the desired spectral width ($SW_1$) and preventing the common pitfall of aliasing. [@problem_id:3719495]", "problem": "In two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the indirect evolution time dimension, denoted $t_1$, is sampled at discrete increments called the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$. The discrete sampling of the time-domain free induction decay (FID) along $t_1$ produces a frequency-domain axis $f_1$ after Fourier transformation. The width of the frequency-domain axis attainable without aliasing is commonly called the spectral width in the indirect dimension and is denoted $SW_1$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$).\n\nStarting only from the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem and the standard properties of Fourier transformation of discretely sampled time-domain signals, derive the relationship among the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$, the sampling rate $f_s$ along $t_1$, and the alias-free spectral width $SW_1$ in the indirect dimension, assuming quadrature detection yields a baseband representation centered at $f_1 = 0$ (so that observed frequencies span symmetrically about zero).

The derivation must start from the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem and the properties of Fourier transforms for discretely sampled data, under the condition of quadrature detection.\n\nLet us begin by stating the problem's underlying principles.\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is a fundamental principle in digital signal processing. For a band-limited real-valued signal, the theorem states that to reconstruct the original signal perfectly from its discrete samples, the sampling rate $f_s$ must be strictly greater than twice the maximum frequency component, $f_{max}$, present in the signal. This is often written as $f_s > 2 f_{max}$. The frequency $f_N = f_s/2$ is known as the Nyquist frequency. If the sampling rate does not meet this criterion, a phenomenon known as aliasing occurs, where high-frequency components of the signal erroneously appear as lower frequencies in the sampled spectrum.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of quadrature detection. This technique involves sampling two components of the signal, one in-phase and one in quadrature (i.e., with a $90^\\circ$ phase shift). This produces a complex signal of the form $s(t) = s_I(t) + i s_Q(t)$. The primary advantage of processing a complex signal is the ability to distinguish between positive and negative frequencies relative to a carrier frequency. The problem states that the experiment yields a baseband representation centered at $f_1 = 0$. This means the carrier frequency has been mixed down to $0$ Hz, and the observed frequencies can be both positive and negative.\n\nFor a complex signal, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem is modified. A complex signal with frequencies limited to the range $[-B/2, B/2]$ has a total bandwidth of $B$. The theorem states that such a signal can be perfectly reconstructed if the complex sampling rate $f_s$ is greater than or equal to the bandwidth $B$. That is, $f_s \\ge B$.\n\nIn the context of NMR spectroscopy, the spectral width, $SW_1$, represents the total frequency range that is to be observed without aliasing. The problem states that the frequencies span symmetrically about zero, so the frequency range of interest is from $-SW_1/2$ to $+SW_1/2$. The total bandwidth of this signal is therefore $(+SW_1/2) - (-SW_1/2) = SW_1$.\n\nApplying the Nyquist-Shannon theorem for complex signals, the minimum sampling rate $f_s$ required to avoid aliasing across the spectral width $SW_1$ is given by the equality:\n$$f_s = SW_1$$\n\nThe signal in the indirect time dimension, $t_1$, is sampled at discrete increments. The duration of this increment is the dwell time, $\\Delta t_1$. The sampling rate, $f_s$, is defined as the number of samples taken per unit time. Therefore, the sampling rate is the reciprocal of the dwell time:\n$$f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_1}$$\n\nBy substituting this expression for $f_s$ into the relationship derived from the sampling theorem, we obtain the direct relationship between the spectral width $SW_1$ and the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$:\n$$SW_1 = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_1}$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship required by the first part of the problem. This equation shows that the spectral width is inversely proportional to the dwell time in the indirect dimension.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires the calculation of the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$ needed to achieve a spectral width of $SW_1 = 5000$ $\\mathrm{Hz}$.

Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Expression**\n\nThe overall goal is to maximize the sensitivity per unit time, $\\eta = \\mathrm{SNR}/\\sqrt{T}$. Let's first derive the expression for the SNR of the peak in the frequency domain.\n\n**Signal Amplitude (S)**\n\nThe time-domain signal for the indirect dimension $t_1$ is sampled at discrete points $t_{1,k} = k \\cdot \\Delta t_1$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, N_1 - 1$.\nThe sampling dwell time is given as $\\Delta t_1 = 1/\\mathrm{SW}_1$.\nSo, the sampled signal is $s_k = s(t_{1,k}) = S_0 \\exp(-k \\Delta t_1 / T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}})$.\nLet's define a decay factor $\\alpha = \\Delta t_1 / T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}} = 1 / (\\mathrm{SW}_1 T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}})$.\nThe sampled signal is $s_k = S_0 \\exp(-k\\alpha)$.\n\nThe problem states that the DFT is a conventional sum. For a peak at zero frequency (assuming the carrier is on resonance, which simplifies the math without loss of generality, as the peak height is what matters), the frequency-domain peak height, $S_{\\nu}$, is the sum of the time-domain signal points.\n$S_{\\nu} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N_1 - 1} s_k = \\sum_{k=0}^{N_1 - 1} S_0 \\exp(-k\\alpha)$.\nThis is a geometric series:\n$S_{\\nu} = S_0 \\sum_{k=0}^{N_1 - 1} (\\exp(-\\alpha))^k = S_0 \\frac{1 - (\\exp(-\\alpha))^{N_1}}{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha)} = S_0 \\frac{1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)}{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha)}$.\n\nSo, the signal part is:\n$S = S_0 \\frac{1 - \\exp(-N_1 / (\\mathrm{SW}_1 T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}))}{1 - \\exp(-1 / (\\mathrm{SW}_1 T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}))}$.\n\n**Noise Level (N)**\n\nLet the standard deviation of the time-domain noise for a single transient be $\\sigma_0$.\nAfter averaging $NS$ transients, the time-domain noise standard deviation becomes $\\sigma_t = \\sigma_0 / \\sqrt{NS}$. This is given in the problem statement.\nThe problem also states that the DFT maps time-domain noise with standard deviation $\\sigma$ to frequency-domain noise with standard deviation $\\sqrt{N_1} \\sigma$.\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the noise in the frequency domain, $\\sigma_{\\nu}$, is:\n$\\sigma_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{N_1} \\sigma_t = \\sqrt{N_1} (\\sigma_0 / \\sqrt{NS}) = \\sigma_0 \\sqrt{N_1 / NS}$.\n\n**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**\n\nThe SNR is the ratio of the peak height signal to the root-mean-square (RMS) noise, which corresponds to the standard deviation for zero-mean noise.\n$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{S}{\\sigma_{\\nu}} = \\frac{S_0 \\frac{1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)}{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha)}}{\\sigma_0 \\sqrt{N_1 / NS}}$.\n\nLet's group the constant terms. $S_0$, $\\sigma_0$, and the denominator $1 - \\exp(-\\alpha)$ are all constants with respect to $N_1$ and $NS$.\nLet $C = \\frac{S_0 / \\sigma_0}{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha)} = \\frac{S_0 / \\sigma_0}{1 - \\exp(-1/(\\mathrm{SW}_1 T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}))}$. This constant $C$ depends on intrinsic signal strength, receiver noise, and fixed experimental parameters $\\mathrm{SW}_1$ and $T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}}$, but not on $N_1$ or $NS$.\n\nThen, the SNR is:\n$\\mathrm{SNR} = C \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)}{\\sqrt{N_1 / NS}} = C \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{NS}}{\\sqrt{N_1}} (1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha))$.\n\n**2. Sensitivity per Unit Time ($\\eta$)**\n\nThe total acquisition time is $T = NS \\cdot N_1 \\cdot TR$.\nWe are asked to analyze the sensitivity per unit time, $\\eta = \\mathrm{SNR} / \\sqrt{T}$.\n$\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{NS \\cdot N_1 \\cdot TR}} \\left( C \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{NS}}{\\sqrt{N_1}} (1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)) \\right)$.\n\nThe $\\sqrt{NS}$ terms cancel out.\n$\\eta = \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{N_1 \\cdot TR} \\cdot \\sqrt{N_1}} (1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)) = \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{TR}} \\frac{1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)}{N_1}$.\n\nThis expression shows how $\\eta$ scales with $N_1$ under the fixed total time constraint. To see the scaling with $NS$, we substitute $N_1 = T/(NS \\cdot TR)$:\n$\\eta = \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{TR}} \\frac{1 - \\exp(- \\frac{T \\alpha}{NS \\cdot TR})}{T/(NS \\cdot TR)} = \\frac{C \\cdot TR}{T \\sqrt{TR}} \\cdot NS \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T \\alpha}{TR} \\frac{1}{NS}\\right) \\right)$.\nSo, the scaling relations are:\n$\\eta(N_1) \\propto \\frac{1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)}{N_1}$\n$\\eta(NS) \\propto NS \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\text{const}}{NS}\\right) \\right)$\n\n**3. Optimization**\n\nTo maximize $\\eta$, we can maximize the part of the expression that depends on the chosen parameters $N_1$ and $NS$. From the expression for $\\eta$ in terms of $N_1$, we need to maximize the function $f(N_1) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)}{N_1}$ where $\\alpha = 1 / (\\mathrm{SW}_1 T_{2,\\mathrm{eff}})$ is a positive constant.\n\nWe analyze the behavior of $f(N_1)$ for $N_1 > 0$ by examining its derivative:\n$\\frac{df}{dN_1} = \\frac{d}{dN_1} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)}{N_1} \\right) = \\frac{N_1 (\\alpha \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha)) - (1 - \\exp(-N_1 \\alpha))(1)}{N_1^2}$\n$\\frac{df}{dN_1} = \\frac{\\exp(-N_1 \\alpha) (\\alpha N_1 + 1) - 1}{N_1^2}$\nLet $x = N_1 \\alpha$. For $N_1 > 0$, we have $x > 0$. The numerator is $\\exp(-x)(x+1) - 1$.\nIt is a well-known inequality that for any $x>0$, $e^x > 1+x$.\nDividing by $e^x$ (which is always positive), we get $1 > (1+x)e^{-x}$.\nThis implies that $(1+x)e^{-x} - 1 < 0$ for all $x>0$.\nTherefore, the numerator of the derivative is always negative for $N_1 > 0$.\nSince the denominator $N_1^2$ is positive, we conclude that $\\frac{df}{dN_1} < 0$ for all $N_1 > 0$.\nThis means that the function $f(N_1)$, and thus the sensitivity per unit time $\\eta$, is a strictly decreasing function of $N_1$.\n\nTo maximize a strictly decreasing function, we must choose the smallest possible value for its argument.\nThe choice of $N_1$ is constrained by the required digital resolution:\n$\\delta \\nu_1 \\le \\Delta \\nu_{1,\\mathrm{req}}$\nGiven the definition $\\delta \\nu_1 = \\mathrm{SW}_1 / N_1$, the constraint becomes:\n$\\frac{\\mathrm{SW}_1}{N_1} \\le \\Delta \\nu_{1,\\mathrm{req}}$\nThis imposes a lower bound on $N_1$:\n$N_1 \\ge \\frac{\\mathrm{SW}_1}{\\Delta \\nu_{1,\\mathrm{req}}}$\nSince $N_1$ must be an integer, the optimal value for $N_1$ that maximizes $\\eta$ is the smallest integer satisfying this condition:\n$N_{1, \\mathrm{opt}} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\mathrm{SW}_1}{\\Delta \\nu_{1,\\mathrm{req}}} \\right\\rceil$\nwhere $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$ denotes the ceiling function.\n\nOnce $N_{1, \\mathrm{opt}}$ is determined, the number of scans $NS$ should be chosen to utilize the total time budget $T$ as fully as possible. The relationship is $NS \\cdot N_1 \\cdot TR \\le T$. To maximize the SNR improvement from signal averaging, we should maximize $NS$.\n$NS \\le \\frac{T}{N_1 \\cdot TR}$\nSince $NS$ must be an integer, the optimal value is:\n$NS_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{T}{N_{1, \\mathrm{opt}} \\cdot TR} \\right\\rfloor$\nwhere $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ denotes the floor function.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now apply this optimization strategy to the given parameters:\n-   $T = 2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 3600 \\text{ s} = 7200 \\text{ s}$\n-   $TR = 1.44 \\text{ s}$\n-   $\\mathrm{SW}_1 = 10000 \\text{ Hz}$\n-   $\\Delta \\nu_{1,\\mathrm{req}} = 40 \\text{ Hz}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the optimal number of indirect increments, $N_{1, \\mathrm{opt}}$:\n$N_{1, \\mathrm{opt}} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\mathrm{SW}_1}{\\Delta \\nu_{1,\\mathrm{req}}} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{10000}{40} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 250 \\rceil = 250$.\n\nNext, we calculate the optimal number of scans per increment, $NS_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, using $N_{1, \\mathrm{opt}} = 250$:\n$NS_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{T}{N_{1, \\mathrm{opt}} \\cdot TR} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7200}{250 \\cdot 1.44} \\right\\rfloor$.\nThe denominator is $250 \\times 1.44 = 360$.\n$NS_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7200}{360} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 20 \\rfloor = 20$.\n\nThe optimized pair of parameters is $(N_1, NS) = (250, 20)$.\nThe total time for this experiment would be $T_{\\mathrm{actual}} = N_1 \\cdot NS \\cdot TR = 250 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 1.44 \\text{ s} = 5000 \\cdot 1.44 \\text{ s} = 7200 \\text{ s}$, which exactly matches the total time budget.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n250 & 20\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3719491"}]}
