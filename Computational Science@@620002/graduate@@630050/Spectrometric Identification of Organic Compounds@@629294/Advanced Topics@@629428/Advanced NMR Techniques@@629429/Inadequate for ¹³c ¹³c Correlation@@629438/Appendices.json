The parameters given are physically realistic, and the problem is well-posed, leading to a unique solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Net Transfer Amplitude\n\nThe INADEQUATE experiment establishes carbon-carbon connectivities by creating and detecting double-quantum coherence (DQC) between a pair of coupled $^{13}$C nuclei. The process involves two critical evolution periods, each of duration $\\tau$, governed by the scalar coupling Hamiltonian, $H_J$.\n\nThe problem states that the evolution during these delays is solely under the isotropic scalar coupling Hamiltonian, $H_{J} = 2\\pi J\\,\\mathbf{I}_1\\cdot \\mathbf{I}_2$. Under high-field conditions, this Hamiltonian is well-approximated by its secular component, $H_{J} \\approx 2\\pi J I_{1z} I_{2z}$. This simplification is justified as the non-secular terms do not mediate the required coherence transfers between in-phase and anti-phase coherences.\n\nThe overall transfer from initial equilibrium magnetization to a final observable signal can be broken down into steps. A simplified, yet conceptually correct, pathway is:\n1.  **Preparation**: A pulse sequence generates in-phase transverse magnetization, e.g., $I_{1x} + I_{2x}$.\n2.  **DQC Generation (First $\\tau$ period)**: The in-phase magnetization evolves under $H_J$ for a duration $\\tau$. This process converts in-phase coherence into anti-phase coherence. For instance, the evolution of an initial term $I_{1x}$ is given by:\n    $$I_{1x} \\xrightarrow{H_J, \\tau} I_{1x}\\cos(\\pi J \\tau) + 2I_{1y}I_{2z}\\sin(\\pi J \\tau)$$\n    The amplitude of the generated anti-phase term, $2I_{1y}I_{2z}$, is thus proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J \\tau)$. A subsequent pulse converts this anti-phase coherence into DQC. The amount of DQC created is therefore proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J \\tau)$.\n3.  **DQC Reconversion (Second $\\tau$ period)**: After some time, the DQC is converted back into anti-phase coherence by another pulse. This anti-phase coherence then evolves under $H_J$ for a second identical period $\\tau$. This evolution converts the anti-phase coherence into observable in-phase magnetization. The efficiency of this second conversion step is also proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J \\tau)$. For example:\n    $$2I_{1y}I_{2z} \\xrightarrow{H_J, \\tau} 2I_{1y}I_{2z}\\cos(\\pi J \\tau) - I_{1x}\\sin(\\pi J \\tau)$$\n    The amplitude of the observable in-phase term, $I_{1x}$, is proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J \\tau)$.\n\nThe net transfer amplitude, which we denote as $A(J, \\tau)$, for the entire process (in-phase $\\rightarrow$ DQC $\\rightarrow$ in-phase) is the product of the efficiencies of the generation and reconversion steps. Since both delays have the same duration $\\tau$, the functional dependence is:\n$$A(J, \\tau) \\propto \\sin(\\pi J \\tau) \\times \\sin(\\pi J \\tau) = \\sin^2(\\pi J \\tau)$$\nFor the purpose of this problem, we can define the normalized amplitude as $A(J, \\tau) = \\sin^2(\\pi J \\tau)$.\n\n### Part 2: Optimization of $\\tau$\n\nWe are given two coupling pathways:\n- One-bond coupling: $J_{1} = 45.0\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n- Two-bond coupling: $J_{2} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nThe transfer amplitudes for these two pathways are:\n- $A_1(\\tau) = \\sin^2(\\pi J_1 \\tau) = \\sin^2(45.0 \\pi \\tau)$\n- $A_2(\\tau) = \\sin^2(\\pi J_2 \\tau) = \\sin^2(5.0 \\pi \\tau)$\n\nWe are tasked to find the smallest positive delay $\\tau$ that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  The one-bond transfer amplitude $A_1(\\tau)$ is maximized.\n2.  The intensity of the two-bond transfer does not exceed $0.04$.\n\n**Condition 1: Maximizing $A_1(\\tau)$**\nThe function $A_1(\\tau) = \\sin^2(45.0 \\pi \\tau)$ reaches its maximum value of $1$ when:\n$$\\sin(45.0 \\pi \\tau) = \\pm 1$$\nThis occurs when the argument of the sine function is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$$45.0 \\pi \\tau = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2} = (k + \\frac{1}{2})\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$$\nSolving for $\\tau$, we get a set of candidate values that maximize the one-bond transfer:\n$$\\tau_k = \\frac{k + 0.5}{45.0}$$\nWe seek the smallest positive $\\tau$, so we will test non-negative integer values of $k$ starting from $k=0$.\n\n**Condition 2: Suppressing the Two-Bond Transfer**\nThe problem states that the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude. Let the intensity be $I(\\tau)$. Then $I(\\tau) \\propto [A(\\tau)]^2$. For the two-bond coupling, this means $I_2(\\tau) \\propto [A_2(\\tau)]^2 = [\\sin^2(5.0 \\pi \\tau)]^2 = \\sin^4(5.0 \\pi \\tau)$.\nThe maximum possible intensity corresponds to the case where the amplitude $A_2(\\tau)$ is maximal, i.e., $A_2(\\tau)=1$. We can thus normalize the intensity such that the maximum intensity is $1$. The constraint is then:\n$$I_2(\\tau) = \\sin^4(5.0 \\pi \\tau) \\le 0.04$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$$\\sin^2(5.0 \\pi \\tau) \\le \\sqrt{0.04}$$\n$$\\sin^2(5.0 \\pi \\tau) \\le 0.2$$\n\n**Finding the Optimal $\\tau$**\nWe must find the smallest $\\tau_k = \\frac{k+0.5}{45.0}$ (for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) that satisfies the inequality $\\sin^2(5.0 \\pi \\tau_k) \\le 0.2$. Let's test values of $k$ sequentially.\n\nFor $k=0$:\n$$\\tau_0 = \\frac{0 + 0.5}{45.0} = \\frac{0.5}{45.0} = \\frac{1}{90.0}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nNow we check if this value of $\\tau$ satisfies Condition 2:\n$$ \\sin^2(5.0 \\pi \\tau_0) = \\sin^2\\left(5.0 \\pi \\times \\frac{1}{90.0}\\right) = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{5.0 \\pi}{90.0}\\right) = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{18}\\right) $$\nThe angle $\\frac{\\pi}{18}$ radians is equal to $10^{\\circ}$.\n$$ \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{18}\\right) \\approx (0.1736)^2 \\approx 0.03015 $$\nWe compare this value to the constraint:\n$$ 0.03015 \\le 0.2 $$\nThe condition is satisfied. Since we started with the smallest possible non-negative integer $k=0$ to find the smallest positive $\\tau$ that maximizes $A_1$, this value $\\tau_0 = \\frac{1}{90.0}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ is the desired solution.\n\nLet's check $k=1$ for completeness:\n$$\\tau_1 = \\frac{1 + 0.5}{45.0} = \\frac{1.5}{45.0} = \\frac{1}{30.0}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nChecking Condition 2:\n$$ \\sin^2(5.0 \\pi \\tau_1) = \\sin^2\\left(5.0 \\pi \\times \\frac{1}{30.0}\\right) = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{5.0 \\pi}{30.0}\\right) = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 $$\nSince $0.25 > 0.2$, this value is not allowed.\n\nThus, the smallest positive $\\tau$ satisfying both requirements is $\\tau = \\frac{1}{90.0}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinally, we convert this value to milliseconds and round to four significant figures:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{1}{90.0}\\ \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1000}{90.0}\\ \\mathrm{ms} \\approx 11.111\\dots\\ \\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $11.11\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11.11}$$", "id": "3707882"}, {"introduction": "Once an INADEQUATE spectrum is acquired, interpreting it requires careful consideration of the molecule's specific features.

It accurately describes the INADEQUATE NMR experiment and poses questions regarding well-defined physical scenarios within the context of this experiment.\n\nThe INADEQUATE (Incredible Natural Abundance Double Quantum Transfer Experiment) experiment is designed to establish correlations between directly bonded carbon atoms. It relies on the detection of the very rare isotopomer containing two adjacent $^{13}$C nuclei. The natural abundance of $^{13}$C is $p \\approx 0.011$, so the probability of finding two adjacent $^{13}$C nuclei in a molecule is approximately $p^2 \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}$. This makes the experiment inherently insensitive.\n\nThe core of the experiment is a double-quantum filter, which involves three main steps:\n1.  **Excitation of Double-Quantum Coherence (DQC)**: Starting from thermal equilibrium magnetization, a sequence of pulses and delays is used to convert single-quantum coherence into DQC. For a two-spin system $(I_1, I_2)$, DQC corresponds to operators like $I_{1+}I_{2+}$ and $I_{1-}I_{2-}$, which represent simultaneous transitions of both spins. This step is sensitive to the scalar coupling constant $J_{\\mathrm{CC}}$.\n2.  **Evolution of DQC**: The DQC evolves during an indirect time period, $t_1$. The DQC of a pair of spins $(I_1, I_2)$ evolves at a frequency corresponding to the sum of their Larmor frequencies, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{DQ}} = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2$. This evolution period provides the basis for the first frequency dimension, $F_1$, of the 2D spectrum.\n3.  **Conversion and Detection**: A final pulse converts the DQC back into observable single-quantum coherence, which is then detected during the acquisition time, $t_2$. This provides the second frequency dimension, $F_2$, which corresponds to the individual Larmor frequencies, $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$.\n\nA cross-peak in a 2D INADEQUATE spectrum for a pair of carbons $\\mathrm{C}_1$ and $\\mathrm{C}_2$ with chemical shifts $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ appears at $F_1$ coordinate $\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}} = \\delta_1 + \\delta_2$. In the $F_2$ dimension, two signals appear, centered at $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$. These signals are typically anti-phase doublets with a splitting equal to $J_{\\mathrm{CC}}$.\n\nThe creation of DQC in the most common INADEQUATE pulse sequences, such as $90^\\circ - \\tau - 180^\\circ - \\tau - 90^\\circ$, relies on the evolution of anti-phase magnetization (e.g., terms like $2I_{1x}I_{2z}$). The efficiency of this process for weakly-coupled spins is governed by a function of the form $\\sin(\\pi J_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\Delta)$, where $\\Delta$ is the total evolution delay for the J-coupling (in this sequence, $\\Delta = 2\\tau$). The optimal delay is $\\Delta = 1/(2J_{\\mathrm{CC}})$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement based on these principles.\n\n**A. For the directly bonded equivalent pair $\\mathrm{C}_2$–$\\mathrm{C}_3$ with $\\delta_2 = \\delta_3$, the standard INADEQUATE cross-peak for that bond is suppressed (approaches zero intensity) under the usual double-quantum filter, even though $J_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\neq 0$, because $\\Delta \\omega = \\omega_2 - \\omega_3 = 0$ leads to symmetry that cancels the anti-phase terms required to create and refocus double-quantum coherence.**\n\nThis statement concerns a system of two chemically and magnetically equivalent spins, an $\\mathrm{A}_2$ system. The Hamiltonian for such a system, given in the problem, is $\\frac{\\mathcal{H}}{\\hbar} = \\omega(I_{2z} + I_{3z}) + 2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\vec{I}_2 \\cdot \\vec{I}_3$, where $\\omega = \\omega_2 = \\omega_3$. This Hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to the permutation of the two spin labels. Both the Hamiltonian and the non-selective radiofrequency pulses act symmetrically on the two spins. The total spin operators $\\vec{I} = \\vec{I}_2 + \\vec{I}_3$ commute with the Hamiltonian. The initial state at thermal equilibrium is proportional to $I_z = I_{2z} + I_{3z}$, which is a symmetric operator.\nSince both the initial state and all subsequent propagators (pulses and free evolution) are symmetric with respect to spin exchange, the density operator remains symmetric at all times.\nThe creation of DQC requires the formation of anti-phase terms like $2I_{2x}I_{3z}$ or $2I_{2y}I_{3z}$. These terms are anti-symmetric under permutation of the spin labels (e.g., swapping $2 \\leftrightarrow 3$ gives $2I_{3x}I_{2z}$, which is different). Therefore, such terms cannot be generated from a symmetric initial state by symmetric operations.\nWithout the generation of anti-phase coherence, the DQC cannot be created. This is a fundamental consequence of the symmetry of the spin system. As a result, the INADEQUATE correlation for a pair of magnetically equivalent carbons is not observed. The reasoning provided in the statement is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. A quaternary carbon $\\mathrm{C}_q$ directly bonded to a protonated carbon $\\mathrm{C}_p$ will produce no INADEQUATE correlation at natural abundance because $\\mathrm{C}_q$ lacks Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) enhancement from attached protons.**\n\nThis statement addresses a practical aspect of $^{13}$C NMR. Quaternary carbons ($\\mathrm{C}_q$) lack directly attached protons. As a result, they do not receive significant Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) enhancement when broadband proton decoupling is applied. The NOE can enhance the signal of protonated carbons by a factor up to $\\eta_{max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\gamma_H}{\\gamma_C} \\approx 1.988$. Furthermore, quaternary carbons often have long spin-lattice relaxation times ($T_1$), which requires long recycle delays between scans to avoid signal saturation, reducing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) achievable in a given amount of time.\nThe INADEQUATE experiment is already very insensitive due to the low probability ($p^2$) of finding a $^{13}$C-$^{13}$C pair. The lack of NOE and the long $T_1$ of the $\\mathrm{C}_q$ nucleus will make the signal from a $\\mathrm{C}_q$-$\\mathrm{C}_p$ pair extremely weak and difficult to observe in practice.\nHowever, the statement asserts that it will produce *no* correlation. This is an absolute claim. The underlying spin physics that allows for DQC creation is still valid as long as there is a non-zero coupling $J_{\\mathrm{C}_q\\mathrm{C}_p}$ and the carbons are chemically non-equivalent ($\\delta_q \\neq \\delta_p$). The lack of NOE is a practical challenge affecting S/N, not a fundamental selection rule forbidding the correlation. Given sufficient experimental time and appropriate parameters, the correlation is, in principle, observable. The statement is therefore an overstatement.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. If two unrelated one-bond pairs satisfy $\\delta_a + \\delta_b = \\delta_c + \\delta_d$ to within the $F_1$ resolution, their INADEQUATE cross-peaks will coincide at the same double-quantum frequency and cannot be disambiguated by the $F_1$ coordinate alone, even though the $F_2$ single-quantum coordinates correspond to different carbons.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes a potential ambiguity in 2D INADEQUATE spectra. The frequency in the indirect dimension, $F_1$, corresponds to the double-quantum frequency, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{DQ}}$. For a coupled spin pair $(\\mathrm{C}_i, \\mathrm{C}_j)$, this frequency is $\\nu_{\\mathrm{DQ}} = \\nu_i + \\nu_j$, or in terms of chemical shifts, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}} = \\delta_i + \\delta_j$.\nIf two distinct, bonded pairs, $(\\mathrm{C}_a, \\mathrm{C}_b)$ and $(\\mathrm{C}_c, \\mathrm{C}_d)$, happen to have sums of chemical shifts that are equal or very close ($\\delta_a + \\delta_b \\approx \\delta_c + \\delta_d$), then their respective double-quantum coherences will evolve at the same frequency during $t_1$.\nConsequently, after Fourier transformation, the cross-peaks for both pairs will appear at the same $F_1$ coordinate. The cross-peaks for the first pair appear at $(\\delta_a+\\delta_b, \\delta_a)$ and $(\\delta_a+\\delta_b, \\delta_b)$. The cross-peaks for the second pair appear at $(\\delta_c+\\delta_d, \\delta_c)$ and $(\\delta_c+\\delta_d, \\delta_d)$. Because $\\delta_a+\\delta_b = \\delta_c+\\delta_d$, all four peaks will lie on the same horizontal line in the 2D spectrum.\nThe statement correctly points out that these pairs \"cannot be disambiguated by the $F_1$ coordinate alone\". This is true, as the $F_1$ coordinate is degenerate. Disambiguation requires inspection of the $F_2$ coordinates, which reveal the individual chemical shifts ($\\delta_a, \\delta_b, \\delta_c, \\delta_d$). Knowing that the pairs are $(\\mathrm{C}_a, \\mathrm{C}_b)$ and $(\\mathrm{C}_c, \\mathrm{C}_d)$ allows one to connect the corresponding peaks in the $F_2$ dimension. The statement is a precise and correct description of this situation.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. When $J_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ is significantly smaller than the delay setting (for example, $2\\pi J_{\\mathrm{CC}}\\tau \\ll \\pi$), reducing $\\tau$ will always increase INADEQUATE transfer efficiency and recover the missing cross-peaks regardless of the chemical shift difference $\\Delta \\omega$.**\n\nThe efficiency of DQC excitation in a spin-echo-based INADEQUATE sequence is proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\Delta)$, where $\\Delta = 2\\tau$ is the total J-evolution time. The experiment is stated to be optimized for $J_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\approx 50\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, which means the delay $\\Delta$ is set to be close to the optimum value $\\Delta_{opt} = 1/(2J_{\\mathrm{CC}}) = 1/(2 \\times 50) = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\nThe statement considers a case where a particular $J'_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ is significantly smaller. Let's say $J'_{\\mathrm{CC}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. With the delay $\\Delta = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{s}$, the argument of the sine function is $x = \\pi J'_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\Delta = \\pi \\times 20 \\times 0.01 = 0.2\\pi$. This value is in the interval $(0, \\pi/2)$.\nThe function $\\sin(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[0, \\pi/2]$. The current operating point, $x=0.2\\pi$, is on this rising slope. The statement claims that *reducing* $\\tau$ (and thus reducing $\\Delta$) will *increase* efficiency. Reducing $\\Delta$ would make the argument $x$ smaller, moving it closer to $0$. This would *decrease* the value of $\\sin(x)$ and thus decrease the transfer efficiency. To increase efficiency for this smaller coupling, one would need to *increase* the delay $\\Delta$ to move the argument closer to the optimal value of $\\pi/2$.\nThe claim that reducing $\\tau$ will \"always\" increase efficiency is false. It depends on the initial value of the argument $\\pi J\\Delta$. If this argument were in the range $(\\pi/2, \\pi)$, then reducing $\\Delta$ would indeed increase the efficiency by moving the argument closer to $\\pi/2$. However, the scenario described (delay optimized for a large J, applied to a small J) places the system in the $(0, \\pi/2)$ range, where the opposite is true.

The outputs are unitless integers.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case $1$ (happy path chain):\n  - $\\Delta = [\\,40.0,\\,30.0,\\,20.0\\,]$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$,\n  - $P = [\\,(70.0,\\,40.0),\\,(50.0,\\,30.0),\\,(60.0,\\,25.0)\\,]$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$,\n  - $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sum}} = 0.2$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sq}} = 0.2$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n- Case $2$ (ambiguity resolved by single-quantum coordinate):\n  - $\\Delta = [\\,100.0,\\,50.0,\\,25.0,\\,75.0\\,]$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$,\n  - $P = [\\,(150.0,\\,50.0),\\,(175.0,\\,75.0),\\,(125.0,\\,25.0),\\,(125.0,\\,75.0)\\,]$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$,\n  - $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sum}} = 0.3$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sq}} = 0.3$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n- Case $3$ (boundary tolerance acceptance and rejection):\n  - $\\Delta = [\\,80.0,\\,30.0,\\,50.0\\,]$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$,\n  - $P = [\\,(110.4,\\,80.0),\\,(130.6,\\,50.0),\\,(80.0,\\,30.0)\\,]$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$,\n  - $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sum}} = 0.5$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sq}} = 0.2$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n- Case $4$ (duplicate and orientation symmetry):\n  - $\\Delta = [\\,60.0,\\,40.0,\\,20.0,\\,10.0\\,]$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$,\n  - $P = [\\,(100.0,\\,60.0),\\,(100.0,\\,40.0),\\,(60.0,\\,40.0),\\,(60.0,\\,20.0),\\,(100.0,\\,60.0)\\,]$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$,\n  - $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sum}} = 0.2$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sq}} = 0.2$ $\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a list of results, one per test case, where each result is the row-major flattened adjacency matrix represented as a list of integers. The entire output must be a single comma-separated aggregate enclosed in square brackets with no spaces, for example $[[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]$.", "solution": "The problem requires the construction of an adjacency matrix, $A$, representing the connectivity graph of carbon atoms in a molecule. This graph is inferred from spectroscopic data obtained from a $^{13}$C INADEQUATE NMR experiment. The solution is thus an algorithmic interpretation of the rules for assigning observed spectral cross-peaks to pairs of directly bonded carbon atoms.\n\nThe inputs for each case are a list of $n$ carbon chemical shifts $\\Delta = [\\delta_1, \\delta_2, \\ldots, \\delta_n]$, a list of $m$ observed cross-peaks $P = \\{(\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}}^{(k)}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}}^{(k)})\\}_{k=1}^m$, and two tolerances, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sum}}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sq}}$. The output is the $n \\times n$ adjacency matrix $A$ flattened into a row-major list.\n\nThe fundamental principle of the INADEQUATE experiment dictates that a cross-peak $(\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}})$ arises from a pair of directly bonded $^{13}$C nuclei, say site $i$ and site $j$, with chemical shifts $\\delta_i$ and $\\delta_j$. The coordinates of the cross-peak are related to the individual chemical shifts by the approximate relations:\n$1$. The double-quantum frequency, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}}$, is the sum of the individual chemical shifts: $\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}} \\approx \\delta_i + \\delta_j$.\n$2$. The single-quantum frequency, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}}$, corresponds to the chemical shift of one of the two coupled nuclei: $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}} \\approx \\delta_i$ or $\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}} \\approx \\delta_j$.\n\nThe problem formalizes these physical principles into a set of precise mathematical conditions. An edge is established between vertices $i$ and $j$ in the graph (i.e., $A_{ij} = A_{ji} = 1$) if there is at least one cross-peak $(\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}})$ that can be confidently assigned to the pair $(i, j)$. The assignment is governed by the following criteria for $i \\neq j$:\n- $|\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}} - (\\delta_i + \\delta_j)| \\le \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sum}}$\n- $\\min\\{|\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}} - \\delta_i|, |\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}} - \\delta_j|\\} \\le \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sq}}$\n\nA crucial aspect of the problem is handling ambiguity. A single cross-peak might satisfy the tolerance conditions for multiple pairs of atoms. To resolve this, a scalar criterion, $r$, is defined to measure the quality of a match:\n$$r = |\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}} - (\\delta_i + \\delta_j)| + \\min\\{|\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}} - \\delta_i|, |\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}} - \\delta_j|\\}$$\nFor each cross-peak, we must find the pair $(i, j)$ that not only satisfies the tolerance conditions but also minimizes this value of $r$. Each cross-peak is assigned to at most one such best-fitting pair.\n\nThe overall algorithm to construct the adjacency matrix $A$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Given the list of $n$ chemical shifts $\\Delta$, initialize an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ with all elements set to $0$. This matrix will represent the graph's adjacency, where $A_{ii}$ is defined to be $0$.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Cross-Peaks**: Process each cross-peak $(\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}})$ from the set $P$ one by one. For each peak, the goal is to find the single best-matching pair of atoms $(i, j)$.\n\n3.  **Find the Best Match for each Peak**: For the current cross-peak, iterate through all possible unique pairs of distinct atoms $(i, j)$ where $0 \\le i  j  n$. For each pair:\n    a.  Let $\\delta_i$ and $\\delta_j$ be the chemical shifts from $\\Delta$ at indices $i$ and $j$.\n    b.  Calculate the sum difference, $\\Delta\\delta_{\\mathrm{sum}} = |\\delta_{\\mathrm{DQ}} - (\\delta_i + \\delta_j)|$.\n    c.  Calculate the single-quantum difference, $\\Delta\\delta_{\\mathrm{sq}} = \\min\\{|\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}} - \\delta_i|, |\\delta_{\\mathrm{SQ}} - \\delta_j|\\}$.\n    d.  Check if the pair is a valid candidate by testing if $\\Delta\\delta_{\\mathrm{sum}} \\le \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sum}}$ and $\\Delta\\delta_{\\mathrm{sq}} \\le \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{sq}}$.\n    e.  If the pair is a valid candidate, calculate its matching score $r = \\Delta\\delta_{\\mathrm{sum}} + \\Delta\\delta_{\\mathrm{sq}}$. Keep track of the pair with the minimum $r$ value found so far for the current peak.\n\n4.  **Update Adjacency Matrix**: After checking all possible pairs for a given cross-peak, if a best-matching pair $(i^*, j^*)$ with the minimum score $r_{\\min}$ has been identified, this assignment is considered confirmed. Update the adjacency matrix to reflect this bond by setting $A_{i^*j^*} = 1$ and $A_{j^*i^*} = 1$. If no pair satisfies the tolerance criteria for the current peak, the peak is considered unassigned noise, and the matrix remains unchanged. The use of an adjacency matrix naturally handles cases where multiple peaks confirm the same bond; setting an element that is already $1$ to $1$ has no effect.\n\n5.  **Finalization**: After all cross-peaks in $P$ have been processed, the matrix $A$ is complete. The final step is to convert this $n \\times n$ matrix into its row-major flattened representation, which is a one-dimensional list of $n^2$ integers.\n\nThis procedure ensures that each cross-peak contributes, at most, one edge to the graph, ambiguities are resolved deterministically, and the resulting connectivity is a direct and logical consequence of the provided data and physical model. The use of NumPy arrays for matrix operations provides an efficient implementation of this algorithm.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the INADEQUATE adjacency matrix construction problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (happy path chain)\n        (\n            [40.0, 30.0, 20.0],\n            [(70.0, 40.0), (50.0, 30.0), (60.0, 25.0)],\n            0.2, 0.2\n        ),\n        # Case 2 (ambiguity resolved by single-quantum coordinate)\n        (\n            [100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 75.0],\n            [(150.0, 50.0), (175.0, 75.0), (125.0, 25.0), (125.0, 75.0)],\n            0.3, 0.3\n        ),\n        # Case 3 (boundary tolerance acceptance and rejection)\n        (\n            [80.0, 30.0, 50.0],\n            [(110.4, 80.0), (130.6, 50.0), (80.0, 30.0)],\n            0.5, 0.2\n        ),\n        # Case 4 (duplicate and orientation symmetry)\n        (\n            [60.0, 40.0, 20.0, 10.0],\n            [(100.0, 60.0), (100.0, 40.0), (60.0, 40.0), (60.0, 20.0), (100.0, 60.0)],\n            0.2, 0.2\n        )\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        delta, peaks, eps_sum, eps_sq = case\n        adj_matrix = build_adjacency_matrix(delta, peaks, eps_sum, eps_sq)\n        # Flatten the matrix to a row-major list of integers.\n        flat_list = adj_matrix.flatten().astype(int).tolist()\n        results.append(flat_list)\n\n    # Format the final output string as a list of lists without spaces.\n    result_strings = [f\"[{','.join(map(str, res))}]\" for res in results]\n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(result_strings)}]\"\n    print(final_output)\n\ndef build_adjacency_matrix(delta, peaks, eps_sum, eps_sq):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs the adjacency matrix from INADEQUATE NMR data.\n\n    Args:\n        delta (list of float): List of chemical shifts.\n        peaks (list of tuple): List of (delta_DQ, delta_SQ) cross-peaks.\n        eps_sum (float): Tolerance for the sum of chemical shifts.\n        eps_sq (float): Tolerance for the single-quantum chemical shift.\n\n    Returns:\n        numpy.ndarray: The n x n adjacency matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(delta)\n    adj_matrix = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=int)\n\n    for delta_dq, delta_sq in peaks:\n        min_r = np.inf\n        best_pair = None\n\n        # Iterate through all unique pairs of atoms (i, j) with i  j\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                delta_i = delta[i]\n                delta_j = delta[j]\n\n                # Calculate differences from experimental values\n                sum_diff = np.abs(delta_dq - (delta_i + delta_j))\n                sq_diff = min(np.abs(delta_sq - delta_i), np.abs(delta_sq - delta_j))\n\n                # Check if the pair is a valid candidate within tolerances\n                if sum_diff = eps_sum and sq_diff = eps_sq:\n                    # Calculate the matching criterion 'r'\n                    r = sum_diff + sq_diff\n                    if r  min_r:\n                        min_r = r\n                        best_pair = (i, j)\n        \n        # If a best-matching pair was found, update the adjacency matrix\n        if best_pair is not None:\n            i, j = best_pair\n            adj_matrix[i, j] = 1\n            adj_matrix[j, i] = 1\n            \n    return adj_matrix\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3707887"}]}
