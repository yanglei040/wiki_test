The dependence of the cross-relaxation rate on the inverse sixth power of the internuclear distance, $\\sigma_{ij} \\propto r_{ij}^{-6}$, is a fundamental aspect of the dipole-dipole relaxation mechanism that gives rise to the NOE.

The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Analysis\nThe intensity of a NOESY cross peak, $I_{ij}$, as a function of mixing time, $t_m$, is governed by the Solomon equations. There are two key regimes:\n\n1.  **Direct NOE**: For a direct interaction between two spins, $i$ and $j$, in the initial rate approximation (i.e., for short $t_m$), the cross-peak intensity grows linearly with time:\n    $$I_{ij}(t_m) \\approx C \\cdot \\sigma_{ij} \\cdot t_m$$\n    where $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the cross-relaxation rate and $C$ is a constant. The build-up curve starts at the origin with a finite slope and eventually plateaus due to longitudinal relaxation ($R_1$).\n\n2.  **Spin Diffusion (Indirect NOE)**: For an indirect transfer between spins $i$ and $k$ via an intermediate spin $j$ ($i \\to j \\to k$), the magnetization must first transfer from $i$ to $j$ before transferring from $j$ to $k$. This introduces a lag phase. The build-up curve for the $i \\to k$ peak starts with a near-zero slope and is initially proportional to $t_m^2$ or a higher power. This results in a sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve with positive curvature at early times.\n\nThe goal is to determine which of the given correlations ($H_A \\text{--} H_B$, $H_B \\text{--} H_C$, $H_A \\text{--} H_C$) is direct versus dominated by spin diffusion.\n\nFirst, let's verify if the short-time data is consistent with the distances. The ratio of cross-relaxation rates should scale with the ratio of distances to the negative sixth power. For the two short-distance pairs:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{AB}}{\\sigma_{BC}} = \\left(\\frac{r_{BC}}{r_{AB}}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\frac{2.6\\,\\text{\\AA}}{2.4\\,\\text{\\AA}}\\right)^6 \\approx (1.0833)^6 \\approx 1.58 $$\nThe ratio of the measured intensities at the short mixing time $t_{m,s} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{I_{AB}(t_{m,s})}{I_{BC}(t_{m,s})} = \\frac{120}{80} = 1.50 $$\nThis excellent agreement confirms that $t_{m,s} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ falls within the initial rate approximation for these two strong, direct interactions, and the data is consistent with the provided distances.\n\nNext, we analyze the change in intensity from the short mixing time, $t_{m,s}$, to the long mixing time, $t_{m,l}$. The ratio of mixing times is $t_{m,l} / t_{m,s} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{s} / 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s} = 6$.\nIf the build-up is linear between these two points, the intensity ratio $R_{ij} = I_{ij}(t_{m,l}) / I_{ij}(t_{m,s})$ should be equal to this time ratio.\n\nLet's compute $R_{ij}$ for each cross peak:\n-   For $H_A \\text{--} H_B$: $R_{AB} = \\frac{I_{AB}(t_{m,l})}{I_{AB}(t_{m,s})} = \\frac{720}{120} = 6.0$\n-   For $H_B \\text{--} H_C$: $R_{BC} = \\frac{I_{BC}(t_{m,l})}{I_{BC}(t_{m,s})} = \\frac{480}{80} = 6.0$\n-   For $H_A \\text{--} H_C$: $R_{AC} = \\frac{I_{AC}(t_{m,l})}{I_{AC}(t_{m,s})} = \\frac{200}{5} = 40.0$\n\n**Interpretation**:\n-   For the $H_A \\text{--} H_B$ and $H_B \\text{--} H_C$ pairs, the intensity ratio $R_{ij}$ is exactly equal to the mixing time ratio ($6.0$). This indicates a perfectly linear build-up between $t_m = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $t_m = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{s}$, which is the hallmark of a direct NOE that is still in the initial rate regime (or at least not significantly saturated).\n-   For the $H_A \\text{--} H_C$ pair, the intensity ratio $R_{AC} = 40.0$ is substantially larger than the mixing time ratio of $6.0$. This signifies a build-up that is much faster than linear. This pronounced positive curvature in the build-up curve is the definitive signature of spin diffusion. Magnetization is transferred efficiently via the path $H_A \\leftrightarrow H_B \\leftrightarrow H_C$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Acquire NOESY at $t_{m,s} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $t_{m,l} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{s}$, process identically, and compute $R_{ij} = I_{ij}(t_{m,l})/I_{ij}(t_{m,s})$ for each cross peak. Classify peaks with $R_{ij} \\approx t_{m,l}/t_{m,s}$ as direct NOE and peaks with $R_{ij} \\gg t_{m,l}/t_{m,s}$ as spin diffusion. Apply to the data: $H_A\\text{--}H_B$ and $H_B\\text{--}H_C$ are direct NOE, $H_A\\text{--}H_C$ is diffusion-dominated.**\n\n-   **Justification**: This option describes a valid and common method for identifying spin diffusion. The criterion correctly associates linear build-up ($R_{ij} \\approx t_{m,l}/t_{m,s}$) with direct NOE and supra-linear build-up ($R_{ij} \\gg t_{m,l}/t_{m,s}$) with spin diffusion. As shown in the analysis above, applying this protocol and criterion to the given data leads to the exact conclusion stated in the option: $R_{AB} = 6$, $R_{BC} = 6$, and $R_{AC} = 40$, correctly identifying $H_A \\text{--} H_B$ and $H_B \\text{--} H_C$ as direct and $H_A \\text{--} H_C$ as spin diffusion.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Acquire two-dimensional Rotating-frame Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (ROESY) at the same mixing times and classify peaks by sign: direct NOE retains sign with increasing $t_m$, while spin diffusion reverses sign at long $t_m$.**\n\n-   **Justification**: The description of the ROESY experiment is partially incorrect. In ROESY, direct cross peaks have a sign opposite to the diagonal peaks. A two-step spin diffusion pathway results in a cross peak with the *same* sign as the diagonal. Therefore, direct and indirect ROEs have opposite signs *to each other*. While ROESY is indeed an excellent experiment for unambiguously identifying spin diffusion by the sign of the cross peak, this option proposes to perform a different experiment (ROESY) instead of analyzing the provided NOESY data. The problem asks for a protocol and analysis that can be applied to the given system and its data. This option discards the provided quantitative data entirely.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Acquire NOESY at three mixing times $t_m \\in \\{0.05\\,\\mathrm{s},\\,0.10\\,\\mathrm{s},\\,0.60\\,\\mathrm{s}\\}$, and for each cross peak fit the short-time regime to $I_{ij}(t_m)$ that is linear in $t_m$; then test for statistically significant positive curvature at longer $t_m$. Peaks that are linear over short $t_m$ and show positive curvature at longer $t_m$ are diffusion-dominated; peaks that remain linear across the tested $t_m$ are direct. Apply to the data: $H_A\\text{--}H_B$ and $H_B\\text{--}H_C$ behave as direct, $H_A\\text{--}H_C$ shows curvature consistent with diffusion via $H_B$.**\n\n-   **Justification**: This option describes the most rigorous method for analyzing NOE build-up kinetics. The fundamental distinction between direct and indirect NOE is the shape of the build-up curve: linear versus sigmoidal (positive curvature). Analyzing the curvature is therefore the physically most meaningful approach. The conclusion stated in the option is fully supported by the provided data, as demonstrated in our initial analysis. The linear intensity growth for $H_A\\text{--}H_B$ and $H_B\\text{--}H_C$ and the strongly supra-linear growth for $H_A\\text{--}H_C$ are hallmarks of linearity versus positive curvature, respectively. Proposing to acquire an additional data point at $t_m=0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}$ represents a sound experimental design improvement for better characterization of the curve shape. The analytical principle and the interpretation of the existing data are both correct.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Acquire NOESY at $t_{m,s}$ and $t_{m,l}$ and normalize each cross-peak intensity by the corresponding diagonal peak intensity at the same $t_m$ before computing $R_{ij}$. Classify peaks by comparing these normalized ratios to $t_{m,l}/t_{m,s}$.**\n\n-   **Justification**: This protocol is physically unsound. The diagonal peak intensity, $I_{ii}(t_m)$, is not constant; it decays during the mixing time due to both longitudinal ($R_{1i}$) and cross-relaxation ($\\sigma_{ij}$). The decay function is complex, typically exponential-like. Normalizing the cross-peak intensity, which grows with $t_m$, by the diagonal intensity, which decays with $t_m$, would introduce a confounding time dependence that obscures the underlying build-up kinetics. The resulting ratio would not be comparable to the simple ratio of mixing times $t_{m,l}/t_{m,s}$. This procedure does not simplify or clarify the analysis; it invalidates it.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Perform one-dimensional selective NOE-difference experiments at only $t_m = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{s}$; label any observed cross peaks as direct NOE and any unobserved peaks as spin diffusion. No additional controls or time dependence are required.**\n\n-   **Justification**: This protocol is fundamentally flawed. Using a single, long mixing time ($t_m = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{s}$) is the ideal condition to *maximize*, not distinguish, spin diffusion effects. At this time, the $H_A\\text{--}H_C$ spin diffusion peak is very strong ($I_{AC}=200$) and would certainly be observed in a 1D NOE experiment. According to the proposed flawed criterion, it would be misidentified as a \"direct NOE\". The correct approach to isolate direct NOEs is to use the shortest possible mixing time that provides a measurable signal, as this minimizes the contribution from multi-step spin diffusion pathways.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3715313"}, {"introduction": "Beyond providing qualitative proximity information, NOESY is a powerful tool for calculating quantitative interproton distances, which serve as essential restraints for high-resolution structure determination.

Record a single NOESY spectrum at a long mixing time (e.g., $\\tau_m = 500$ ms) to maximize cross-peak volumes, integrate cross-peaks, and divide each cross-peak by the corresponding diagonal peak intensity to correct for relaxation.

This yields $H_x-H_y$ at approximately $3.15$ Å and reduces the sensitivity to correlation time variations.", "solution": "The problem requires the formulation of a protocol for determining interproton distances from Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY (NOESY) data and the subsequent calculation of an unknown distance, $H_x-H_y$, using an internal reference.\n\nFirst, a rigorous validation of the problem statement is performed.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n-   Molecule: A small, rigid organic molecule.\n-   Technique: Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY (NOESY), specifically the initial build-up rate approach.\n-   Spectrometer frequency: $600$ MHz for protons.\n-   Mixing times: A build-up series with $\\tau_m \\in \\{30, 60, 90, 120\\}$ ms.\n-   Data analysis: Linear least-squares fits of cross-peak volume vs. $\\tau_m$ through the origin to obtain initial slopes ($s$).\n-   Internal Reference: Proton pair $H_a-H_b$ with a fixed distance $r_{\\text{ref}} = 2.50$ Å.\n-   Reference data: Initial slope for the reference pair, $s_{\\text{ref}} = 0.96$ a.u. $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n-   Unknown: Proton pair $H_x-H_y$.\n-   Unknown data: Initial slope for the unknown pair, $s_{xy} = 0.12$ a.u. $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n-   Molecular dynamics: Tumbling in the fast-to-intermediate regime.\n-   Observation: NOE cross-peaks are weak but measurable in the short-$\\tau_m$ limit.\n\n**Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of solution-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

The description of a small molecule being in the fast-to-intermediate tumbling regime at a high field is physically plausible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Protocol and Calculation**\n\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) arises from dipole-dipole cross-relaxation between nuclear spins in close proximity. In a 2D NOESY experiment, the intensity (volume) of a cross-peak, $V_{ij}$, between two protons $i$ and $j$ as a function of the mixing time $\\tau_m$ is described by the Solomon equations. For short mixing times, this relationship can be linearized, which is the basis of the initial rate approximation.\n\nIn this limit ($\\tau_m \\to 0$), the cross-peak volume grows linearly with $\\tau_m$:\n$$V_{ij}(\\tau_m) \\approx M_{0,j} \\sigma_{ij} \\tau_m$$\nwhere $M_{0,j}$ is the initial magnetization of the irradiated spin $j$ and $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the cross-relaxation rate between spins $i$ and $j$. The initial build-up rate, $s_{ij}$, is the slope of this curve at $\\tau_m=0$:\n$$s_{ij} = \\left. \\frac{dV_{ij}}{d\\tau_m} \\right|_{\\tau_m=0} \\propto \\sigma_{ij}$$\n\nThe cross-relaxation rate $\\sigma_{ij}$ is governed by the dipole-dipole interaction and is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{ij} = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\right)^2 \\frac{\\gamma^4 \\hbar^2}{r_{ij}^6} [6J(2\\omega_0) - J(0)]$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the proton gyromagnetic ratio, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $r_{ij}$ is the distance between protons $i$ and $j$, $\\omega_0$ is the Larmor frequency, and $J(\\omega)$ is the spectral density function, which depends on the molecular reorientational correlation time, $\\tau_c$.\n\nFor a rigid molecule undergoing isotropic tumbling, the correlation time $\\tau_c$ and thus the spectral density functions are identical for all proton pairs within that molecule. Consequently, the term involving constants and the spectral density function is the same for all pairs. This allows us to write a simplified relationship for the initial rate:\n$$s_{ij} = C \\cdot \\frac{1}{r_{ij}^6}$$\nThe constant of proportionality, $C$, absorbs all factors that are common to all proton pairs in the molecule under a single set of experimental conditions. These factors include $\\gamma$, $\\hbar$, $\\tau_c$, as well as instrumental and processing parameters.\n\nThe most reliable method for determining unknown distances, $r_{xy}$, is to use a known, fixed distance, $r_{\\text{ref}}$, within the same molecule as an internal reference. By taking the ratio of the initial rates for the unknown pair ($xy$) and the reference pair (ref), the constant $C$ is eliminated:\n$$\\frac{s_{xy}}{s_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{C/r_{xy}^6}{C/r_{\\text{ref}}^6} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{ref}}}{r_{xy}}\\right)^6$$\nSolving for the unknown distance $r_{xy}$ yields:\n$$r_{xy}^6 = r_{\\text{ref}}^6 \\left( \\frac{s_{\\text{ref}}}{s_{xy}} \\right)$$\n$$r_{xy} = r_{\\text{ref}} \\left( \\frac{s_{\\text{ref}}}{s_{xy}} \\right)^{1/6}$$\n\nThis equation forms the basis of the calculation. A sound experimental protocol must ensure the validity of the assumptions leading to this equation. Specifically:\n1.  **Initial Rate Regime:** Data must be collected for a series of short mixing times $\\tau_m$ to establish and verify a linear build-up region, thus minimizing contributions from spin diffusion (multi-step magnetization transfer).\n2.  **Internal Calibration:** An internal reference pair with a well-defined, rigid geometry is essential to cancel out the effects of molecular tumbling ($\\tau_c$) and other unknown proportionality constants.\n3.  **Intermediate Tumbling:** The problem notes that the molecule is in a regime where NOEs are weak. This occurs when $\\omega_0\\tau_c \\approx 1.12$, causing the term $[6J(2\\omega_0) - J(0)]$ to approach zero. A complete protocol must account for this by proposing an alternative if NOEs are unmeasurable, such as ROESY, where the cross-relaxation is always positive.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nUsing the provided values:\n-   $r_{\\text{ref}} = 2.50$ Å\n-   $s_{\\text{ref}} = 0.96$ a.u. $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $s_{xy} = 0.12$ a.u. $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nWe substitute these into the derived formula:\n$$r_{xy} = 2.50 \\, \\text{Å} \\times \\left( \\frac{0.96}{0.12} \\right)^{1/6}$$\n$$r_{xy} = 2.50 \\, \\text{Å} \\times (8)^{1/6}$$\nSince $8 = 2^3$, we have $(8)^{1/6} = (2^3)^{1/6} = 2^{3/6} = 2^{1/2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n$$r_{xy} = 2.50 \\, \\text{Å} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.50 \\, \\text{Å} \\times 1.41421...$$\n$$r_{xy} \\approx 3.5355 \\, \\text{Å}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, consistent with the input distance, gives $r_{xy} = 3.54$ Å.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** This option proposes a comprehensive and correct protocol. It advocates for a NOESY build-up series at short $\\tau_m$, fitting initial rates, and verifying linearity. It correctly mentions the use of an internal reference and the inverse-sixth-power distance dependence ($r^{-6}$). It includes sound practices like normalization and consistent processing. Crucially, it addresses the potential issue of near-zero NOEs in the intermediate tumbling regime by suggesting a switch to ROESY. The calculated distance of approximately $3.54$ Å matches our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This option is fundamentally flawed. It suggests using a single, long mixing time ($\\tau_m = 500$ ms), which maximizes spin diffusion artifacts and invalidates the simple relationship between cross-peak intensity and a single pairwise distance. Furthermore, it incorrectly states that the distance scaling is inverse-cube ($r^{-3}$), which contravenes the physics of dipole-dipole relaxation ($r^{-6}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This option contains multiple errors. While correctly identifying ROESY as a technique for the intermediate tumbling regime, it advocates for using a single steady-state spectrum, which is susceptible to relayed effects (the ROESY equivalent of spin diffusion). It also proposes using an external standard, which is an inferior method as it does not control for the specific molecular correlation time of the analyte. The claim that spin diffusion is negligible in ROESY is false. The calculated distance is also inconsistent with any simple physical model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This option starts correctly by proposing a build-up series, but it then introduces a non-standard and physically questionable normalization procedure. Most critically, it incorrectly assumes an inverse-cube ($r^{-3}$) distance dependence, which is physically wrong. The calculated distance is inconsistent with this incorrect premise as well ($2.50 \\times (8)^{1/3} = 5.0$ Å, not $3.15$ Å).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a physically sound protocol, uses the correct theoretical framework, and provides the correct numerical result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3715311"}]}
