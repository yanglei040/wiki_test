The result is a standard one in spin dynamics. The amount of magnetization on spin $S$, given by the expectation value of the $S_x$ operator, evolves as:\n$$\n\\langle S_x \\rangle (\\tau_m) = \\sin^2(\\pi J \\tau_m)\n$$\nThis quantity represents the amount of magnetization transferred to spin $S$. The initial amount of magnetization on spin $I$ is normalized to $\\text{Tr}\\{I_x^2\\}=1$.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution will be derived using the product operator formalism, tracking the state of the spin system's density operator, $\\sigma$. We are interested in the efficiency of two INEPT transfer steps, which are affected by an imperfect delay duration.\n\nThe overall signal intensity is proportional to the product of the efficiencies of the forward transfer (proton to carbon) and the reverse transfer (carbon back to proton). Let's analyze each transfer step.\n\n**1. Forward INEPT Transfer**\n\nThe purpose of the first INEPT block is to convert the equilibrium proton magnetization into heteronuclear antiphase magnetization.\nThe sequence of operations on the initial density operator $\\sigma_0 = I_z$ is as follows:\na. An ideal $90^\\circ$ pulse about the $x$-axis is applied to the $I$ spins.\n$$ \\sigma_0 = I_z \\xrightarrow{90^\\circ_x(I)} \\sigma_1 = -I_y $$\nb. The system evolves under the scalar coupling Hamiltonian $H=2\\pi J I_{z}S_{z}$ for a delay period $\\Delta$. The evolution of the density operator is given by $\\sigma(\\Delta) = \\exp(-iH\\Delta)\\sigma_1\\exp(iH\\Delta)$.\nThe evolution of the $-I_y$ term is:\n$$ -I_y \\xrightarrow{2\\pi J I_z S_z \\Delta} -I_y \\cos(\\pi J \\Delta) + 2I_xS_z \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta) $$\nSo, the state after the delay is:\n$$ \\sigma_2 = -I_y \\cos(\\pi J \\Delta) + 2I_x S_z \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta) $$\nThe term $2I_xS_z$ represents the desired proton antiphase magnetization with respect to carbon. The subsequent pulses in the HMQC sequence (not detailed here, but typically a $90^\\circ$ pulse on $S$) convert this term into heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence. The efficiency of this creation step is determined by the coefficient of the $2I_xS_z$ term, which is $\\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)$.\n\nThe problem states that the nominal delay is set to the optimal value, which maximizes this transfer. The function $\\sin(\\pi J \\Delta)$ is maximized when $\\pi J \\Delta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which gives the optimal delay $\\Delta_{opt} = \\frac{1}{2J}$.\n\nThe actual delay is misset by an amount $\\epsilon$, so $\\Delta_1 = \\Delta_{opt} + \\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2J} + \\epsilon$.\nThe efficiency factor for the forward transfer, $\\eta_1$, is:\n$$ \\eta_1 = \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta_1) = \\sin\\left(\\pi J \\left(\\frac{1}{2J} + \\epsilon\\right)\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\pi J \\epsilon\\right) $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$, we get:\n$$ \\eta_1 = \\cos(\\pi J \\epsilon) $$\n\n**2. Reverse INEPT Transfer**\n\nAfter the $t_1$ evolution and the TOCSY mixing period, the magnetization is transferred back from carbon to the proton for detection. The reverse INEPT block converts heteronuclear antiphase magnetization (e.g., $2I_xS_z$) back into observable in-phase proton magnetization (e.g., $-I_y$). The process is symmetric to the forward transfer.\n\nAssuming the state entering the final delay of the reverse INEPT is $2I_xS_z$, it evolves under $H=2\\pi J I_{z}S_{z}$ for a second delay period, $\\Delta_2$.\n$$ 2I_xS_z \\xrightarrow{2\\pi J I_z S_z \\Delta_2} 2I_xS_z \\cos(\\pi J \\Delta_2) + 2I_yS_z \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta_2) $$\nThe observable term is in-phase magnetization, here $I_y$ (within the $2I_yS_z$ product). The amplitude of the created in-phase magnetization is proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J \\Delta_2)$.\n\nThe problem states this delay is also misset by the same amount $\\epsilon$. So, $\\Delta_2 = \\frac{1}{2J} + \\epsilon$.\nThe efficiency factor for the reverse transfer, $\\eta_2$, is therefore:\n$$ \\eta_2 = \\sin(\\pi J \\Delta_2) = \\sin\\left(\\pi J \\left(\\frac{1}{2J} + \\epsilon\\right)\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\pi J \\epsilon\\right) = \\cos(\\pi J \\epsilon) $$\n\n**3. Total Signal Attenuation and Fractional Loss**\n\nThe total detected signal amplitude, $S(\\epsilon)$, is proportional to the product of the efficiencies of the two transfer steps:\n$$ S(\\epsilon) \\propto \\eta_1 \\times \\eta_2 = \\cos(\\pi J \\epsilon) \\times \\cos(\\pi J \\epsilon) = \\cos^2(\\pi J \\epsilon) $$\nThe ideal signal, $S_{ideal}$, is obtained when the delay is set correctly, i.e., $\\epsilon=0$.\n$$ S_{ideal} \\propto \\cos^2(\\pi J \\cdot 0) = \\cos^2(0) = 1 $$\nThe normalized detected signal attenuation is the ratio of the actual signal to the ideal signal:\n$$ S_{norm}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{S(\\epsilon)}{S_{ideal}} = \\cos^2(\\pi J \\epsilon) $$\nThe fractional loss of signal is the difference between the ideal normalized signal ($1$) and the actual normalized signal:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Loss} = 1 - S_{norm}(\\epsilon) = 1 - \\cos^2(\\pi J \\epsilon) $$\nUsing the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1$, we obtain the closed-form expression for the fractional loss:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Loss} = \\sin^2(\\pi J \\epsilon) $$\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this fractional loss for a coupling constant $J = 140\\,\\text{Hz}$ and a timing error $\\epsilon = 1\\,\\text{ms} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the argument of the sine function, $\\pi J \\epsilon$.

For complex data acquisition, such as that achieved with the States-TPPI method, the sampling rate is equal to the spectral width. The time increment $\\Delta t_1$ is the reciprocal of the spectral width:\n$$\n\\Delta t_1 = \\frac{1}{SW_1}\n$$\nThe total acquisition time in the indirect dimension, $T_{acq,1}$, is the duration over which the signal is sampled.
