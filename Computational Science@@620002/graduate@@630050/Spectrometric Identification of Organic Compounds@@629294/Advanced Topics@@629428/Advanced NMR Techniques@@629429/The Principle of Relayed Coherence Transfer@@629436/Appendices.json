Selective saturation at $B$ during NOESY/EXSY suppresses both exchange-mediated and relayed coherence transfer cross peaks equally, because both mechanisms require finite $M_{z,B}$ during the longitudinal mixing period $\\tau_m$.\n\nD. Saturating $A$ during the NOESY/EXSY mixing period is the appropriate control; if relay is operative, saturation of $A$ increases the $A$–$C$ intensity in TOCSY via saturation-driven spin diffusion, confirming relayed coherence transfer.", "solution": "The core of the problem is to differentiate between two distinct physical mechanisms that can give rise to an $A$–$C$ cross peak in a system where direct coupling $J_{AC}$ is negligible, but an indirect pathway $A$–$B$–$C$ exists via non-zero couplings $J_{AB}$ and $J_{BC}$.\n\n**Mechanism 1: Chemical Exchange (EXSY)**\nA NOESY/EXSY experiment measures the transfer of longitudinal magnetization during the mixing period $\\tau_m$. The pulse sequence is structured as (evolution $t_1$) -- $90^\\circ$ pulse -- (mixing $\\tau_m$) -- $90^\\circ$ pulse -- (detection $t_2$). The first $90^\\circ$ pulse stores frequency-labeled transverse magnetization as longitudinal magnetization. During $\\tau_m$, this longitudinal magnetization can be physically transferred from one chemical site to another via chemical exchange. If exchange occurs from site $A$ to $C$ (pathway $A \\leftrightarrow B \\leftrightarrow C$), magnetization initially associated with spin $A$ will appear at spin $C$ after the mixing time. This transfer is described by the Bloch–McConnell equations. For a transfer from $A$ to $C$ via the intermediate $B$, longitudinal magnetization must flow from $A$ to $B$, and subsequently from $B$ to $C$. The spin at site $B$ is thus a mandatory intermediate for the longitudinal magnetization.\n\nThe control experiment involves applying a selective saturation field to resonance $B$ during the mixing time $\\tau_m$. As stated in the provided principles, this forces the longitudinal magnetization of $B$ to be approximately zero ($M_{z,B} \\approx 0$). In this state, spin $B$ acts as a magnetization sink. Any magnetization transferred from $A$ to $B$ is effectively destroyed by the saturation field and cannot be relayed further to $C$. Consequently, the exchange pathway $A \\to B \\to C$ is blocked. If the $A$–$C$ cross peak in the NOESY/EXSY spectrum were due to this exchange mechanism, it would be strongly attenuated or eliminated in the control experiment.\n\n**Mechanism 2: Relayed Coherence Transfer (TOCSY/COSY)**\nThis mechanism is fundamentally different. It occurs in experiments like TOCSY or COSY. A TOCSY experiment, for example, uses a spin-lock pulse sequence during its mixing period. This creates an effective Hamiltonian where scalar couplings ($J_{ij}$) dominate, allowing for the efficient transfer of *transverse* magnetization (coherence) through the coupling network. For the $A$–$B$–$C$ system, coherence on spin $A$ can be transferred to $B$ via $J_{AB}$, and then from $B$ to $C$ via $J_{BC}$. This process does not involve the transfer of longitudinal magnetization. The state of $M_{z,B}$ during the TOCSY mixing period is irrelevant to the transfer of coherence from $A$ to $C$. A COSY experiment also relies on the evolution of transverse coherence under J-couplings, not on longitudinal magnetization transfer.\n\n**Interpretation of the Control Experiment**\nThe problem asks to predict the outcome under the hypothesis that \"true relayed coherence transfer ... is responsible for the observed $A$–$C$ connectivity\". This implies that the definitive $A$–$C$ cross peak is seen in a TOCSY or COSY spectrum. The control experiment is a *separate* NOESY/EXSY experiment designed to test for the alternative hypothesis of chemical exchange.\n- The TOCSY/COSY experiment showing the relayed peak is one measurement.\n- The NOESY/EXSY with saturation at $B$ is a second, independent measurement.\nPerforming the NOESY/EXSY experiment does not alter the physics of the TOCSY/COSY experiment. Therefore, the $A$–$C$ connectivity due to relayed coherence transfer will, of course, persist in the TOCSY/COSY data, regardless of what is done in the NOESY/EXSY experiment. The NOESY/EXSY control experiment serves to rule out chemical exchange as the cause. If no exchange is occurring, no $A$–$C$ peak should be present in the NOESY/EXSY spectrum in the first place (assuming negligible NOE between $A$ and $C$). The saturation at $B$ would then simply confirm the absence of an exchange pathway.\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options based on this analysis.\n\n**A. Selective saturation at $B$ during the NOESY/EXSY mixing period will strongly suppress exchange-mediated cross peaks that require longitudinal transfer via $B$, so the $A$–$C$ cross peak disappears from the NOESY/EXSY control. If the observed connectivity is due to true relayed coherence transfer in TOCSY/COSY, the $A$–$C$ connectivity persists there with essentially unchanged intensity, because $I_{AC}^{\\mathrm{relay}} \\propto (2\\pi J_{AB})(2\\pi J_{BC})\\,\\tau_m^2$ does not rely on $M_{z,B}$ during NOESY/EXSY mixing.**\n- The first part correctly states that saturation at $B$ during NOESY/EXSY mixing suppresses exchange-mediated peaks by blocking the longitudinal transfer pathway through $B$.\n- The second part correctly notes that if the connectivity is a result of relayed coherence transfer in a TOCSY/COSY experiment, it will naturally persist in that separate experiment. The reasoning provided is also sound: relayed coherence transfer is a transverse mechanism independent of the longitudinal magnetization state of the intermediate spin $B$. This option accurately describes the purpose and outcome of the control experiment in the context of the two distinct physical phenomena.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Selective saturation at $B$ during NOESY/EXSY will invert the sign of the $A$–$C$ cross peak while leaving its magnitude unchanged if relay through $B$ is operative, due to antiphase-to-inphase conversion under saturation.**\n- This is physically incorrect. First, a standard NOESY/EXSY experiment is not designed to generate relayed coherence transfer peaks. Second, saturation of a longitudinal spin state does not induce sign inversions of cross peaks in this manner. Phase properties of cross peaks are determined by coherence transfer pathways and pulse sequence phase cycling, not by saturating a longitudinal magnetization state. The concept of antiphase-to-inphase conversion is related to evolution under J-coupling, not saturation during a longitudinal mixing period.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Selective saturation at $B$ during NOESY/EXSY suppresses both exchange-mediated and relayed coherence transfer cross peaks equally, because both mechanisms require finite $M_{z,B}$ during the longitudinal mixing period $\\tau_m$.**\n- The premise of this statement is false. As established in the principles and the analysis above, relayed coherence transfer is a *transverse* coherence transfer phenomenon and does not depend on the longitudinal magnetization $M_{z,B}$. It is the exchange mechanism that relies on $M_{z,B}$ to propagate magnetization. Therefore, saturation at $B$ would affect the two mechanisms differently.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Saturating $A$ during the NOESY/EXSY mixing period is the appropriate control; if relay is operative, saturation of $A$ increases the $A$–$C$ intensity in TOCSY via saturation-driven spin diffusion, confirming relayed coherence transfer.**\n- This option proposes the wrong control experiment. To test the role of an intermediate species $B$ in a proposed $A \\to B \\to C$ pathway, one must perturb $B$. Saturating $A$ would eliminate all transfer *originating* from $A$, making it impossible to study any pathway from $A$. Furthermore, it conflates mechanisms: \"spin diffusion\" refers to the stepwise transfer of longitudinal magnetization (like multi-step NOE), which is distinct from relayed *coherence* transfer (TOCSY). Finally, it incorrectly suggests that an action in a NOESY/EXSY experiment (saturation) would affect the outcome of a separate TOCSY experiment.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3727679"}]}
