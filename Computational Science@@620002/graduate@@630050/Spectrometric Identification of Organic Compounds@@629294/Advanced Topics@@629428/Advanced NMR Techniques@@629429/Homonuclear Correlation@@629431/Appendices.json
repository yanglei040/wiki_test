It presents a self-contained, scientifically grounded scenario based on the principles of Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. While the core assumption—that the spectral width is determined by the maximum scalar coupling $J_{\\max}$ rather than by chemical shift dispersion—-represents a specific and simplified experimental model, it does not violate fundamental principles and serves as an explicit constraint for this theoretical problem. All terms are well-defined, and the objectives are clear, leading to a well-posed problem.\n\nThe solution is derived by applying the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem and the fundamental relationships of the Fourier transform between the time and frequency domains.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimal spectral width in the indirect frequency dimension, $SW_1$, required to avoid aliasing. The Nyquist-Shannon theorem states that the sampling frequency, $f_s$, must be at least twice the maximum frequency, $f_{\\max}$, present in the signal that one wishes to digitize without distortion: $f_s \\ge 2 f_{\\max}$.\n\nIn this NMR experiment, the signal is sampled in the indirect time dimension, $t_1$, with a uniform dwell time of $\\Delta t_1$. The sampling frequency is therefore $f_s = 1/\\Delta t_1$. The problem defines the spectral width as $SW_1 = 1/\\Delta t_1$. Thus, the sampling frequency is numerically equal to the spectral width, $f_s = SW_1$.\n\nThe use of phase-sensitive acquisition via TPPI means that both positive and negative frequencies relative to the transmitter are distinguished. The spectral width $SW_1$ covers a frequency range from $-SW_1/2$ to $+SW_1/2$. To prevent aliasing (folding), any frequency component $\\nu$ in the signal must satisfy the condition $|\\nu| \\le SW_1/2$.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that due to a band-selective implementation, the highest frequency content in the $t_1$ dimension is bounded by the maximum scalar coupling, $J_{\\max}$. Therefore, we must set the maximum frequency to be considered, $f_{\\max}$, equal to $J_{\\max}$. Applying the aliasing condition:\n$$\nJ_{\\max} \\le \\frac{SW_1}{2}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to find the minimum required spectral width:\n$$\nSW_{1, \\min} = 2 J_{\\max}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the minimal number of increments, $N_1$, required to achieve the target digital resolution, $\\Delta \\nu_{F_1}$. The digital resolution in a frequency dimension is determined by the inverse of the total acquisition time in the corresponding time dimension. The problem provides this relationship:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu_{F_1} = \\frac{1}{t_{1,\\max}}\n$$\nTo meet the target resolution, the total acquisition time must be $t_{1,\\max} = 1/\\Delta \\nu_{F_1}$.\n\nThe total acquisition time is also defined by the number of increments $N_1$ and the dwell time $\\Delta t_1$:\n$$\nt_{1,\\max} = N_1 \\Delta t_1\n$$\nWe can express $\\Delta t_1$ in terms of the minimal spectral width, $SW_{1, \\min}$, we just determined:\n$$\n\\Delta t_1 = \\frac{1}{SW_{1, \\min}} = \\frac{1}{2 J_{\\max}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $t_{1,\\max}$:\n$$\nt_{1,\\max} = N_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2 J_{\\max}} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we equate the two expressions for $t_{1,\\max}$ to solve for $N_1$:\n$$\nN_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2 J_{\\max}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta \\nu_{F_1}}\n$$\n$$\nN_1 = \\frac{2 J_{\\max}}{\\Delta \\nu_{F_1}}\n$$\nSince $N_1$ represents the number of increments (i.e., the number of individual experiments performed), it must be an integer.

Select all statements that are correct.\n\nA. In a two-spin system with Hamiltonian $H = \\omega_a I_z + \\omega_b S_z + 2\\pi J_{ab} I_z S_z$, coherence transfer that produces COSY cross peaks requires evolution under the $2\\pi J_{ab} I_z S_z$ term to generate antiphase two-spin coherences.

The analysis will be based on the quantum mechanical principles of 2D NMR spectroscopy, specifically the product operator formalism applied to COSY and DQF-COSY experiments.\n\nThe spin system consists of two protons, $H_a$ and $H_b$. The relevant part of the spin Hamiltonian in a rotating frame is given by:\n$$ H = \\omega_a I_{az} + \\omega_b I_{bz} + 2\\pi J_{ab} \\vec{I_a} \\cdot \\vec{I_b} $$\nIn a high-field approximation for a weakly coupled system, this simplifies to:\n$$ H = \\omega_a I_{az} + \\omega_b I_{bz} + 2\\pi J_{ab} I_{az} I_{bz} $$\nHere, $\\omega_a$ and $\\omega_b$ are the resonance frequencies (in rad/s) of spins $a$ and $b$, respectively, and $J_{ab}$ is the scalar coupling constant (in Hz). The problem states that the spins are uncoupled, so $J_{ab} \\approx 0$.\n\n**1. Mechanism of COSY and the role of $J$-coupling**\n\nThe basic COSY experiment consists of two non-selective $\\pi/2$ pulses separated by an evolution time $t_1$:\n$$ (\\pi/2)_{\\phi_1} - t_1 - (\\pi/2)_{\\phi_2} - t_2(\\text{acquisition}) $$\nLet's consider the fate of the initial thermal equilibrium magnetization, for example $I_{az}$. The first $(\\pi/2)_x$ pulse converts it into transverse magnetization:\n$$ I_{az} \\xrightarrow{(\\pi/2)_x} -I_{ay} $$\nDuring the evolution period $t_1$, this magnetization evolves under the Hamiltonian. The chemical shift term $(\\omega_a I_{az})$ causes precession, while the scalar coupling term $(2\\pi J_{ab} I_{az} I_{bz})$ creates antiphase coherence. The evolution of $-I_{ay}$ is:\n$$ -I_{ay} \\xrightarrow{H t_1} -I_{ay} \\cos(\\omega_a t_1)\\cos(\\pi J_{ab} t_1) + I_{ax} \\sin(\\omega_a t_1)\\cos(\\pi J_{ab} t_1) + 2I_{ax}I_{bz} \\cos(\\omega_a t_1)\\sin(\\pi J_{ab} t_1) + 2I_{ay}I_{bz} \\sin(\\omega_a t_1)\\sin(\\pi J_{ab} t_1) $$\nFor a cross peak to form between spin $a$ and spin $b$, magnetization initially associated with spin $a$ must be transferred to spin $b$. This transfer is executed by the second pulse (the \"mixing\" pulse). The crucial terms for this transfer are the antiphase terms, $2I_{ax}I_{bz}$ and $2I_{ay}I_{bz}$. For instance, the second $(\\pi/2)_x$ pulse acts on the antiphase term $2I_{ay}I_{bz}$:\n$$ 2I_{ay}I_{bz} \\xrightarrow{(\\pi/2)_x} -2I_{az}I_{by} $$\nThe resulting term $-2I_{az}I_{by}$ represents transverse magnetization of spin $b$ ($I_{by}$), which is antiphase with respect to spin $a$ (due to the $I_{az}$ factor). This term evolves during $t_2$ to produce a detectable signal at frequency $\\omega_b$, which is modulated in amplitude by the frequency $\\omega_a$ from the $t_1$ period. This constitutes the cross peak.\n\nThe key insight is that the generation of these essential antiphase terms is proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J_{ab} t_1)$. From the problem statement, we are given that $J_{ab} \\approx 0$. Consequently, $\\sin(\\pi J_{ab} t_1) \\approx 0$ for all values of $t_1$. No antiphase coherence is generated. Without antiphase coherence before the mixing pulse, no coherence transfer from spin $a$ to spin $b$ can occur. Therefore, no cross peak is formed. The near-degeneracy condition, $\\lvert \\omega_a - \\omega_b \\rvert \\ll \\lvert \\omega_a \\rvert$, is irrelevant to the physical mechanism of coherence transfer; it only dictates that if a cross peak were to form, it would be located very close to the diagonal.\n\n**2. Discrimination using Double-Quantum Filtered (DQF)-COSY**\n\nThe DQF-COSY experiment provides a rigorous method for discrimination. Its pulse sequence typically involves three pulses and a phase cycle designed to select for signals that have passed through a state of double-quantum coherence (DQC). A two-spin DQC operator has the form such as $2I_{ax}I_{by} - 2I_{ay}I_{bx}$.\n\nThe generation of such a two-spin DQC from initial single-quantum coherences requires the spins to be coupled. An isolated spin or a pair of uncoupled spins cannot generate a multiple-quantum coherence involving both spins. The intensity of the DQC generated is, like the antiphase coherence in a simple COSY, dependent on terms proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J_{ab} t_1)$.\n\nIf $J_{ab} \\approx 0$, no two-spin DQC can be created between spins $a$ and $b$. The double-quantum filter will therefore reject any signal pathway involving these two spins. Crucially, this applies not only to the (absent) cross peaks but also to the diagonal peaks. A major feature of DQF-COSY is the suppression of diagonal peaks arising from isolated (uncoupled) spins.\n\nTherefore, the discrimination is as follows:\n- **Uncoupled, near-degenerate pair ($J_{ab} \\approx 0, \\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$):** No cross peaks appear in either COSY or DQF-COSY. In DQF-COSY, the diagonal response from these spins is also strongly suppressed.\n- **Coupled, near-degenerate pair ($J_{ab} \\neq 0, \\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$):** Cross peaks will be present in both COSY (though potentially obscured by the diagonal) and DQF-COSY. The DQF-COSY spectrum will show cleaner cross peaks with a reduced diagonal, making them easier to identify.\n\nThis provides a definitive way to distinguish the two scenarios within the framework of homonuclear correlation spectroscopy.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In a two-spin system with Hamiltonian $H = \\omega_a I_z + \\omega_b S_z + 2\\pi J_{ab} I_z S_z$, coherence transfer that produces COSY cross peaks requires evolution under the $2\\pi J_{ab} I_z S_z$ term to generate antiphase two-spin coherences. If $J_{ab} = 0$, no such terms are created and no cross peaks can form; similar $\\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$ does not substitute for coupling. A Double-Quantum Filtered COSY, which selects two-spin double-quantum coherences, will retain cross peaks only for coupled spins; near-degenerate uncoupled resonances will be suppressed along with the diagonal, thus discriminating them.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the underlying physics. It correctly identifies the necessity of the $J$-coupling term for creating antiphase coherence for transfer in COSY. It correctly states that near-degeneracy is not a substitute for coupling. Finally, it accurately describes the function of a DQF-COSY experiment: it selects for coupled systems by filtering through two-spin DQC, thereby suppressing signals from uncoupled spins. **Correct**.\n\n**B. When $\\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$, destructive interference during $t_1$ cancels off-diagonal magnetization regardless of $J_{ab}$, explaining the absence of cross peaks. However, DQF-COSY recovers cross peaks for such pairs due to residual dipolar couplings in isotropic solution.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the absence of cross peaks is due to $J_{ab} \\approx 0$, not destructive interference related to $\\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$. If $J_{ab}$ were non-zero, cross peaks would exist. Second, in an isotropic liquid, rapid molecular tumbling averages the direct dipole-dipole interaction to zero. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are not observed under \"routine conditions in an isotropic liquid.\" Coherence transfer in COSY experiments in isotropic solution is mediated by scalar coupling, not dipolar coupling. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. COSY cross peaks primarily arise from cross-relaxation (Nuclear Overhauser Effect, NOE) rather than scalar coupling, so even if $J_{ab} = 0$ one can grow cross peaks by extending the mixing time $\\tau_m$; near-degenerate resonances are discriminated by their stronger NOE-driven cross peaks.**\nThis statement incorrectly describes the COSY experiment. The COSY (COrrelation SpectroscopY) experiment probes correlations via through-bond $J$-coupling. The experiment that relies on through-space cross-relaxation (NOE) is NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY). The mechanisms are fundamentally different. Extending a mixing time $\\tau_m$ to build up cross-peak intensity is characteristic of NOESY, not COSY. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Near-degenerate spins are magnetically equivalent by virtue of $\\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$, so equivalence alone yields cross peaks in COSY independent of $J_{ab}$. To discriminate uncoupled near-degenerate resonances, one should use in-phase COSY with shorter $\\tau_m$, which enhances equivalence-induced cross peaks.**\nThis statement misuses terminology and is physically incorrect. Near-degeneracy ($\\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$) does not imply magnetic equivalence. Magnetic equivalence requires spins to be chemically equivalent (interchangeable by a symmetry operation) and to have identical couplings to all other nuclei in the spin system. Furthermore, \"equivalence alone\" does not produce cross peaks; a coupling pathway is always required for coherence transfer. The concept of \"equivalence-induced cross peaks\" is not valid. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Phase-sensitive COSY distinguishes coupled from uncoupled near-degenerate spins by the presence of $J$-dependent antiphase cross-peak lineshapes and $t_1$-dependent sign modulation for coupled pairs; uncoupled near-degenerate resonances show only diagonal response regardless of $\\tau_m$ and $t_1$. Complementarily, DQF-COSY, which passes only coherences created via nonzero $J_{ab}$, will suppress signals from uncoupled near-degenerate spins while retaining cross peaks from coupled pairs, providing a robust discrimination within homonuclear correlation.**\nThis statement is also entirely accurate. It correctly describes the observable features in a phase-sensitive COSY spectrum for a coupled pair: the antiphase nature of the cross peaks and their $t_1$ modulation, which depend on $J_{ab}$. It correctly states that for an uncoupled pair, only a diagonal signal is seen. It then correctly presents DQF-COSY as a complementary and definitive method, highlighting that it filters out the uncoupled case by selecting for coherences whose creation is $J$-dependent. **Correct**.\n\nBoth statements A and E are correct and describe the situation accurately from slightly different perspectives (mechanism vs. spectral appearance).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "3707244"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting real-world spectra often involves more than just identifying correlations; it requires the skill to distinguish genuine signals from experimental artifacts.

Proceeding to solution.\n\n---\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe problem requires classifying the observed cross-peaks in a DQF-COSY spectrum as genuine correlations or artifacts, based on aliasing in the $F_1$ dimension and the inherent properties of the DQF-COSY experiment.\n\n### Fundamental Principles\n1.  **Scalar Coupling and COSY**: A cross-peak at coordinates $(\\delta_X, \\delta_Y)$ in a COSY-type spectrum indicates a scalar ($J$) coupling between the nuclei resonating at chemical shifts $\\delta_X$ and $\\delta_Y$.\n2.  **Symmetry**: COSY spectra are symmetric with respect to the diagonal line $F_1 = F_2$. A genuine correlation between spins $X$ and $Y$ must produce a pair of cross-peaks, one at $(\\delta_X, \\delta_Y)$ and a symmetric partner at $(\\delta_Y, \\delta_X)$.\n3.  **Phase-Sensitive DQF-COSY**: In a phase-sensitive DQF-COSY spectrum, both diagonal peaks and cross-peaks are purely absorptive. Critically, the two cross-peaks of a symmetric pair, $(\\delta_X, \\delta_Y)$ and $(\\delta_Y, \\delta_X)$, must have the **same sign**. This is a key distinction from standard phase-sensitive COSY, where they have opposite signs.\n4.  **Aliasing (Folding)**: According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, a signal with a true chemical shift $\\delta_{true}$ that is outside the spectral window of width $SW$ will appear at an aliased chemical shift, $\\delta_{alias}$, within the window. The relationship is $\\delta_{alias} = \\delta_{true} - n \\cdot SW$, where $n$ is an integer chosen such that $\\delta_{alias}$ falls within the defined spectral window. In this problem, aliasing only occurs in the $F_1$ dimension, where $SW_1 = 4.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ and the window is $[2.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm}, 6.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm}]$.\n\n### Analysis of Aliasing in $F_1$\nLet's calculate the expected aliased positions for signals originating from spins A, B, and C in the $F_1$ dimension.\n- **Spin A**: $\\delta_{A,true} = 7.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This is above the window's upper edge of $6.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. Using $n=1$, the aliased position is $\\delta_{A,alias} = 7.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm} - 1 \\times 4.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm} = 3.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This is within the $[2.00, 6.00]\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ window.\n- **Spin B**: $\\delta_{B,true} = 6.08\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This is just above the upper edge. Using $n=1$, the aliased position is $\\delta_{B,alias} = 6.08\\,\\mathrm{ppm} - 1 \\times 4.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm} = 2.08\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This is within the window.\n- **Spin C**: $\\delta_{C,true} = 1.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This is below the window's lower edge of $2.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. Using $n=-1$, the aliased position is $\\delta_{C,alias} = 1.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm} - (-1) \\times 4.00\\,\\mathrm{ppm} = 5.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. This is within the window.\n\n### Analysis of Observed Cross-Peaks\nWe assume couplings $A \\leftrightarrow B$ and $B \\leftrightarrow C$.\n\n**1. Analysis of the $A \\leftrightarrow B$ Correlation:**\n- The genuine correlation should produce cross-peaks at true coordinates $(\\delta_A, \\delta_B) = (7.42, 6.08)$ and $(\\delta_B, \\delta_A) = (6.08, 7.42)$.\n- Let's trace their expected appearance in the spectrum, considering $F_1$ folding:\n    - The peak at $(\\delta_A, \\delta_B)$ should appear with its $F_1$ coordinate folded: $(\\delta_{A,alias}, \\delta_B) = (3.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm}, 6.08\\,\\mathrm{ppm})$. This exactly matches the observed peak **$P1$**.\n    - The peak at $(\\delta_B, \\delta_A)$ should appear with its $F_1$ coordinate folded: $(\\delta_{B,alias}, \\delta_A) = (2.08\\,\\mathrm{ppm}, 7.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm})$. This is not observed.\n- However, we do observe peak **$P2$** at $(6.08\\,\\mathrm{ppm}, 7.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm})$. This corresponds to the true coordinates $(\\delta_B, \\delta_A)$ with an *unfolded* $F_1$ axis.\n- Let's verify if $P1$ and $P2$ represent a legitimate, symmetric pair. The true coordinates of $P1$ are found by \"unfolding\" its $F_1$ coordinate: $3.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm} + SW_1 = 7.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, so the true peak is at $(7.42, 6.08)$. The true coordinates of $P2$ are $(6.08, 7.42)$. These two sets of coordinates, $(\\delta_A, \\delta_B)$ and $(\\delta_B, \\delta_A)$, are perfectly symmetric across the diagonal.\n- Furthermore, according to the problem, $P1$ and $P2$ both have a positive sign. This satisfies the DQF-COSY rule that symmetric partners must have the same sign.\n- **Conclusion**: $P1$ and $P2$ are the genuine, symmetric pair of cross-peaks for the $A \\leftrightarrow B$ correlation. $P1$ is aliased in $F_1$, while $P2$ appears at its true (unfolded) $F_1$ coordinate.\n\n**2. Analysis of the $B \\leftrightarrow C$ Correlation:**\n- This correlation should produce cross-peaks at true coordinates $(\\delta_B, \\delta_C) = (6.08, 1.90)$ and $(\\delta_C, \\delta_B) = (1.90, 6.08)$.\n- We observe peak **$P4$** at $(6.08\\,\\mathrm{ppm}, 1.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm})$, which matches $(\\delta_B, \\delta_C)$ exactly.\n- We observe peak **$P3$** at $(1.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}, 6.08\\,\\mathrm{ppm})$, which matches $(\\delta_C, \\delta_B)$ exactly.\n- These two peaks, $P3$ and $P4$, are perfectly symmetric with respect to the diagonal, appearing at their true (unfolded) coordinates.\n- The problem states that both $P3$ and $P4$ have a negative sign. This satisfies the DQF-COSY rule that symmetric partners have the same sign.\n- **Conclusion**: $P3$ and $P4$ are the genuine, symmetric pair of cross-peaks for the $B \\leftrightarrow C$ correlation.\n\n**3. Analysis of Peak $P5$:**\n- Peak **$P5$** is observed at $(3.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm}, 1.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm})$.\n- The $F_1$ coordinate, $3.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, is $\\delta_{A,alias}$. The $F_2$ coordinate, $1.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, is $\\delta_C$. Thus, $P5$ appears at $(\\delta_{A,alias}, \\delta_C)$. This would imply a correlation between $A$ and $C$.\n- The problem explicitly states to assume there is no $A \\leftrightarrow C$ coupling. On this basis alone, $P5$ should be considered an artifact.\n- Independent of this assumption, we must apply the symmetry principle. If $P5$ were a genuine correlation, it must have a symmetric partner at true coordinates $(\\delta_C, \\delta_A) = (1.90, 7.42)$. This partner peak would appear in the spectrum with its $F_1$ coordinate either unfolded at $1.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ or folded at $\\delta_{C,alias} = 5.90\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. No peak is observed at either $(1.90, 7.42)$ or $(5.90, 7.42)$.\n- **Conclusion**: The lack of a symmetric partner proves that $P5$ is an artifact, not a genuine correlation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $P1$ and $P2$ are the genuine $A\\text{–}B$ correlations; $P3$ and $P4$ are the genuine $B\\text{–}C$ correlations; $P5$ is a folding artifact. The justification is that in DQF-COSY true cross-peaks appear as a diagonally symmetric pair with the same sign; after unfolding $\\,F_1\\,$ by adding $\\,SW_1\\,$ to $\\,\\delta_{A,\\mathrm{alias}} = 3.42\\,\\mathrm{ppm}\\,$, $P1$ at $\\,(7.42,6.08)\\,$ becomes diagonally symmetric with $P2$ at $\\,(6.08,7.42)\\,$ and both are positive. $P3$ and $P4$ are already diagonally symmetric and both negative. $P5$ lacks a diagonally symmetric partner even after unfolding and contradicts the absence of $A\\text{–}C$ coupling, so it is an artifact.**\n- This option correctly identifies all genuine peaks and the artifact. The justification provided is comprehensive and correct. It correctly applies the principles of DQF-COSY (symmetry, same sign) and aliasing (unfolding $P1$ to establish symmetry with $P2$). It correctly analyzes the $P3/P4$ pair. It correctly identifies $P5$ as an artifact due to the lack of a symmetric partner and contradiction with the given coupling network.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $P1$ is an artifact because its $\\,F_1\\,$ coordinate does not match the $\\,F_2\\,$ coordinate of $P2$ across the diagonal; $P2$ is the sole genuine $A\\text{–}B$ correlation; $P3$ and $P4$ are genuine $B\\text{–}C$ correlations; $P5$ indicates a long-range $A\\text{–}C$ correlation.**\n- This option incorrectly dismisses $P1$ by failing to account for aliasing. Cross-peaks are not required to be symmetric in their apparent coordinates when folding is present. It also incorrectly states that a correlation can consist of a single peak. It wrongly accepts $P5$ as genuine, ignoring the lack of a symmetric partner and the problem's assumption.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The genuine correlations are recognized by opposite signs across the diagonal in DQF-COSY; hence $P1$ and $P2$ are artifacts, while $P3$ and $P4$ are genuine; $P5$ is genuine because it is positive.**\n- This option is based on a fundamentally incorrect premise. In phase-sensitive DQF-COSY, symmetric cross-peaks have the **same** sign. The stated rule of \"opposite signs\" applies to standard phase-sensitive COSY. Based on this false rule, its classification is flawed. $P1/P2$ are a valid pair (same sign), and $P3/P4$ are also a valid pair (same sign). The option's logic is internally inconsistent and factually wrong.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. All five peaks are genuine correlations because aliasing in $\\,F_1\\,$ preserves diagonal symmetry, so $P5$ indicates a weak $A\\text{–}C$ coupling missed in one-dimensional analysis; signs are not useful in DQF-COSY.**\n- This option incorrectly claims all peaks are genuine, ignoring the crucial test for a symmetric partner for $P5$. It also incorrectly claims that signs are not useful in DQF-COSY, which is false; the phase properties are a key diagnostic feature of the experiment.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3707228"}]}
