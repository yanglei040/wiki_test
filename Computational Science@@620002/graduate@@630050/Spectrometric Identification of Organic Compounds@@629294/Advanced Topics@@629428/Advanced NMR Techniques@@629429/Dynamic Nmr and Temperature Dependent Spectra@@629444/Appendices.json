The complex transverse magnetization is defined as $G = M_x + iM_y$. For sites A and B, the magnetizations are $G_A$ and $G_B$.\n\nThe coupled differential equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{dG_A}{dt} = - (R_{2A} + i(\\omega_A - \\omega)) G_A - k_{AB} G_A + k_{BA} G_B + i \\omega_1 M_{0A}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dG_B}{dt} = - (R_{2B} + i(\\omega_B - \\omega)) G_B - k_{BA} G_B + k_{AB} G_A + i \\omega_1 M_{0B}\n$$\nHere, $R_{2A}$ and $R_{2B}$ are the intrinsic transverse relaxation rates, $\\omega_A$ and $\\omega_B$ are the Larmor frequencies of the two sites, $\\omega$ is the irradiating radiofrequency, $k_{AB}$ and $k_{BA}$ are the rate constants for the A $\\to$ B and B $\\to$ A exchange processes, respectively, $\\omega_1$ is the strength of the RF field, and $M_{0A}$ and $M_{0B}$ are the equilibrium longitudinal magnetizations, proportional to the populations $p_A$ and $p_B$.\n\nThe problem states several simplifying assumptions:\n1.  **Equal Populations**: The sites are equally populated, so $p_A = p_B = \\frac{1}{2}$. This implies $M_{0A} = M_{0B} = \\frac{1}{2} M_0$.\n2.  **Symmetric Rates**: The forward and reverse rate constants are equal, $k_{AB} = k_{BA} = k$.\n3.  **Negligible Intrinsic Relaxation**: $R_{2A} = R_{2B} = 0$, as relaxation is dominated by exchange at coalescence.\n4.  **No Scalar Coupling**: The two sites are uncoupled.\n\nUnder these conditions and at steady state ($\\frac{dG_A}{dt} = \\frac{dG_B}{dt} = 0$), the equations simplify to:\n$$\n(i(\\omega_A - \\omega) + k) G_A - k G_B = i \\frac{\\omega_1 M_0}{2}\n$$\n$$\n-k G_A + (i(\\omega_B - \\omega) + k) G_B = i \\frac{\\omega_1 M_0}{2}\n$$\nThis is a system of two linear equations in $G_A$ and $G_B$. We solve for the total complex magnetization, $G_{total} = G_A + G_B$. Solving this system yields:\n$$\nG_{total} = C \\left( \\frac{(\\alpha_A + \\alpha_B + 2k)}{(\\alpha_A \\alpha_B - k^2)} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $C = i \\frac{\\omega_1 M_0}{2}$, $\\alpha_A = i(\\omega_A - \\omega) + k$, and $\\alpha_B = i(\\omega_B - \\omega) + k$.\n\nLet's simplify the terms in the expression for $G_{total}$:\nThe numerator term:\n$\\alpha_A + \\alpha_B + 2k = i(\\omega_A - \\omega) + k + i(\\omega_B - \\omega) + k + 2k = i(\\omega_A + \\omega_B - 2\\omega) + 4k$\nThe denominator term:\n$\\alpha_A \\alpha_B - k^2 = (i(\\omega_A - \\omega) + k)(i(\\omega_B - \\omega) + k) - k^2 = -(\\omega_A - \\omega)(\\omega_B - \\omega) + ik(\\omega_A + \\omega_B - 2\\omega)$\n\nLet's define the average angular frequency $\\omega_{avg} = \\frac{(\\omega_A + \\omega_B)}{2}$ and the frequency offset from the average $\\delta\\omega = \\omega - \\omega_{avg}$. The separation in angular frequency is $\\Delta\\omega = \\omega_A - \\omega_B$.\nThen, $\\omega_A - \\omega = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2} - \\delta\\omega$, $\\omega_B - \\omega = -\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2} - \\delta\\omega$, and $\\omega_A + \\omega_B - 2\\omega = -2\\delta\\omega$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $G_{total}$:\n$$\nG_{total} \\propto \\frac{4k - 2i\\delta\\omega}{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2}\\right)^2 - (\\delta\\omega)^2 - 2ik\\delta\\omega}\n$$\nThe absorption lineshape, $v(\\omega)$, is proportional to the imaginary part of $G_{total}$. To find $Im(G_{total})$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $((\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2})^2 - (\\delta\\omega)^2 + 2ik\\delta\\omega)$.\nThe imaginary part of the resulting expression is proportional to:\n$$\nv(\\omega) \\propto \\frac{k(\\Delta\\omega)^2}{\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2}\\right)^2 - (\\delta\\omega)^2\\right]^2 + 4k^2(\\delta\\omega)^2}\n$$\nCoalescence occurs when the two separate maxima of the lineshape function merge into a single maximum at the center ($\\delta\\omega = 0$). To find the positions of the maxima, we set the derivative of $v(\\omega)$ with respect to $\\delta\\omega$ to zero, $\\frac{dv}{d(\\delta\\omega)} = 0$. This is equivalent to setting the derivative of the denominator to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d(\\delta\\omega)} \\left( \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2}\\right)^2 - (\\delta\\omega)^2\\right]^2 + 4k^2(\\delta\\omega)^2 \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2}\\right)^2 - (\\delta\\omega)^2\\right](-2\\delta\\omega) + 8k^2\\delta\\omega = 0\n$$\n$$\n4\\delta\\omega \\left( - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2}\\right)^2 + (\\delta\\omega)^2 + 2k^2 \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has solutions at $\\delta\\omega = 0$ (the center of the spectrum) and at positions where $(\\delta\\omega)^2 = (\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2})^2 - 2k^2$.\nFor two distinct peaks to exist (slow exchange), we must have $(\\delta\\omega)^2 > 0$, which implies $(\\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2})^2 > 2k^2$.\nCoalescence is the limiting condition where the two distinct peaks merge into one. This occurs precisely when $(\\delta\\omega)^2 = 0$.\nTherefore, the coalescence condition is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{|\\Delta\\omega|}{2}\\right)^2 - 2k_c^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{(\\Delta\\omega)^2}{4} = 2k_c^2 \\implies (\\Delta\\omega)^2 = 8k_c^2\n$$\nTaking the square root, we get the coalescence condition in terms of the angular frequency separation $\\Delta\\omega$ and the rate constant at coalescence $k_c$:\n$$\n|\\Delta\\omega| = 2\\sqrt{2}k_c\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Signal Assignment and Calculation of the Flipping Rate**\n\nFirst, we must assign the given chemical shifts, $\\delta = 2.35 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and $\\delta = 1.10 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$, to the axial and equatorial protons. In a monosubstituted cyclohexane chair conformation, an axial proton on the substituted carbon (C1) experiences steric compression from the two other axial protons at the C3 and C5 positions. These 1,3-diaxial interactions cause deshielding of the C1-axial proton, shifting its resonance to a higher frequency (downfield, larger $\\delta$ value). The equatorial proton does not experience such strong interactions and is therefore more shielded.\nThus, we assign the signals as:\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{ax}} = 2.35 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 1.10 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$\n\nNext, we calculate the separation between these resonances in Hertz. The separation in ppm is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\delta = |\\delta_{\\mathrm{ax}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{eq}}| = |2.35 - 1.10| = 1.25 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}\n$$\nThe separation in Hertz, $\\Delta\\nu$, is found by multiplying $\\Delta\\delta$ by the spectrometer frequency, $\\nu_0 = 400.0 \\ \\mathrm{MHz}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu = \\Delta\\delta \\times \\nu_0 = 1.25 \\times 10^{-6} \\times (400.0 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{Hz}) = 500.0 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nThe angular frequency separation is $|\\Delta\\omega| = 2\\pi\\Delta\\nu$. From the derived coalescence condition, we can solve for $k_c$:\n$$\nk_c = \\frac{|\\Delta\\omega|}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2\\pi\\Delta\\nu}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\pi\\Delta\\nu}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\Delta\\nu$:\n$$\nk_c = \\frac{\\pi \\times 500.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{3.14159 \\times 500.0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 1110.72 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The input value $\\Delta\\delta = 1.25 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ has three significant figures, which limits the precision of our result.\n$$\nk_c \\approx 1.11 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.11 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "3700024"}, {"introduction": "While 1D lineshape analysis is invaluable, it can become complicated for systems with multiple exchange pathways or unequal populations.

We can express the mole fractions in terms of $K(T)$:\n$$x_A = \\frac{1}{1 + N_B/N_A} = \\frac{1}{1 + K(T)}$$\n$$x_B = \\frac{N_B/N_A}{1 + N_B/N_A} = \\frac{K(T)}{1 + K(T)}$$\n\nIn the fast-exchange regime, the observed chemical shift, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T)$, is the mole-fraction weighted average of the intrinsic chemical shifts of the two sites, $\\delta_A(T)$ and $\\delta_B(T)$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = x_A \\delta_A(T) + x_B \\delta_B(T)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $x_A$ and $x_B$ yields the desired expression for $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T)$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = \\frac{1}{1 + K(T)} \\delta_A(T) + \\frac{K(T)}{1 + K(T)} \\delta_B(T)$$\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = \\frac{\\delta_A(T) + K(T) \\delta_B(T)}{1 + K(T)}$$\n\n### Part 2: Computation of $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T)$ at $T = 278~\\mathrm{K}$ and $T = 318~\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the true equilibrium constant $K(T)$ at the specified temperatures using the van’t Hoff relation. The standard Gibbs free energy change is $\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, and $\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K$. Thus:\n$$\\ln K(T) = -\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ}{RT} = -\\frac{\\Delta H - T\\Delta S}{RT} = -\\frac{\\Delta H}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta S}{R}$$\nGiven $\\Delta H = 7500~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$ and $\\Delta S = 10~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$:\n\nAt $T = 278~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\\ln K(278) = -\\frac{7500~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{(8.314~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}})(278~\\mathrm{K})} + \\frac{10~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}}{8.314~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}} \\approx -3.2435 + 1.2028 = -2.0407$$\n$$K(278) = e^{-2.0407} \\approx 0.12995$$\n\nAt $T = 318~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\\ln K(318) = -\\frac{7500~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{(8.314~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}})(318~\\mathrm{K})} + \\frac{10~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}}{8.314~\\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}} \\approx -2.8360 + 1.2028 = -1.6332$$\n$$K(318) = e^{-1.6332} \\approx 0.19529$$\n\nNext, we calculate the intrinsic chemical shifts $\\delta_A(T)$ and $\\delta_B(T)$ at these temperatures, using $T_0 = 298~\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nAt $T = 278~\\mathrm{K}$ ($T - T_0 = -20~\\mathrm{K}$):\n$$\\delta_A(278) = 1.20~\\mathrm{ppm} + (-6.0\\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{ppm\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (-20~\\mathrm{K}) = 1.20 + 0.012 = 1.212~\\mathrm{ppm}$$\n$$\\delta_B(278) = 3.20~\\mathrm{ppm} + (+2.0\\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{ppm\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (-20~\\mathrm{K}) = 3.20 - 0.004 = 3.196~\\mathrm{ppm}$$\n\nAt $T = 318~\\mathrm{K}$ ($T - T_0 = +20~\\mathrm{K}$):\n$$\\delta_A(318) = 1.20~\\mathrm{ppm} + (-6.0\\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{ppm\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (20~\\mathrm{K}) = 1.20 - 0.012 = 1.188~\\mathrm{ppm}$$\n$$\\delta_B(318) = 3.20~\\mathrm{ppm} + (+2.0\\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{ppm\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (20~\\mathrm{K}) = 3.20 + 0.004 = 3.204~\\mathrm{ppm}$$\n\nFinally, we compute $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T)$ using the expression from Part 1.\n\nAt $T = 278~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(278) = \\frac{1.212 + (0.12995)(3.196)}{1 + 0.12995} = \\frac{1.212 + 0.41532}{1.12995} = \\frac{1.62732}{1.12995} \\approx 1.4402~\\mathrm{ppm}$$\n\nAt $T = 318~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(318) = \\frac{1.188 + (0.19529)(3.204)}{1 + 0.19529} = \\frac{1.188 + 0.62571}{1.19529} = \\frac{1.81371}{1.19529} \\approx 1.5173~\\mathrm{ppm}$$\n\n### Part 3: Apparent Equilibrium Constant $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$\n\nThe practitioner assumes temperature-independent chemical shifts, $\\delta_A = \\delta_A(T_0) = 1.20~\\mathrm{ppm}$ and $\\delta_B = \\delta_B(T_0) = 3.20~\\mathrm{ppm}$. The apparent equilibrium constant $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ is extracted by inverting the weighted-average relation under this assumption:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = \\frac{\\delta_A(T_0) + K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) \\delta_B(T_0)}{1 + K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)}$$\nSolving for $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) (1 + K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)) = \\delta_A(T_0) + K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) \\delta_B(T_0)$$\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) + \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) = \\delta_A(T_0) + K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) \\delta_B(T_0)$$\n$$K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) (\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) - \\delta_B(T_0)) = \\delta_A(T_0) - \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T)$$\n$$K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) = \\frac{\\delta_A(T_0) - \\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T)}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) - \\delta_B(T_0)}$$\n\nNow we evaluate $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ using the true $\\delta_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T)$ values calculated in Part 2.\n\nAt $T = 278~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{app}}(278) = \\frac{1.20 - 1.4402}{1.4402 - 3.20} = \\frac{-0.2402}{-1.7598} \\approx 0.1365$$\nComparison: $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(278) \\approx 0.1365$ vs. $K(278) \\approx 0.12995$. We see $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(278) > K(278)$.\n\nAt $T = 318~\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{app}}(318) = \\frac{1.20 - 1.5173}{1.5173 - 3.20} = \\frac{-0.3173}{-1.6827} \\approx 0.1886$$\nComparison: $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(318) \\approx 0.1886$ vs. $K(318) \\approx 0.19529$. We see $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(318) < K(318)$.\n\nThe assumption of constant chemical shifts leads to a systematic error in the determination of the equilibrium constant. The error, $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) - K(T)$, is positive for $T < T_0$ and negative for $T > T_0$, indicating the bias reverses sign. At $T=T_0$, the assumption is correct by definition, so $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T_0) = K(T_0)$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ equals the true $K(T)$ at all temperatures, even when $\\alpha_A \\neq \\alpha_B$.**\nThis is demonstrably false from our calculations. $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ only equals $K(T)$ if the assumed shifts are the true shifts. This only occurs at $T=T_0$ or if $\\alpha_A$ and $\\alpha_B$ are both zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. With the parameters given, $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(278~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.136$ exceeds $K(278~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.130$, whereas $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(318~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.188$ is less than $K(318~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.195$, indicating a bias that reverses sign around $T_0$.**\nOur calculations yield $K(278~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.130$ and $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(278~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.136$ (or $0.137$). Also, $K(318~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.195$ and $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(318~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.189$ (or $0.188$). The values stated in the option are consistent with our calculations modulo minor rounding. The statement correctly identifies that $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(278~\\mathrm{K}) > K(278~\\mathrm{K})$ and $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(318~\\mathrm{K}) < K(318~\\mathrm{K})$. This confirms that the bias reverses sign around $T_0$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Because $\\delta_A$ decreases with temperature, $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ is smaller than $K(T)$ at both $278~\\mathrm{K}$ and $318~\\mathrm{K}$.**\nThe premise is stated imprecisely. With $\\alpha_A < 0$, $\\delta_A(T)$ increases as temperature decreases. More importantly, the conclusion is wrong. Our calculation shows that at $T = 278~\\mathrm{K}$, $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ is larger than $K(T)$. Therefore, this statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Assuming fixed $\\delta_A$ and $\\delta_B$ always makes $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ rise with $T$ faster than the true van’t Hoff $K(T)$; here that would imply $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(278~\\mathrm{K}) < K(278~\\mathrm{K})$ and $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(318~\\mathrm{K}) > K(318~\\mathrm{K})$.**\nThe implication described ($K_{\\mathrm{app}}(278~\\mathrm{K}) < K(278~\\mathrm{K})$ and $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(318~\\mathrm{K}) > K(318~\\mathrm{K})$) is the direct opposite of what we calculated. Therefore, the premise that $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ rises faster than $K(T)$ is incorrect for the given parameters. The apparent slope of $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ is actually smaller than the true slope of $K(T)$ in the studied temperature range.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3700010"}]}
