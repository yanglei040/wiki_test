The physical basis for the NOE is the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, which gives rise to cross-relaxation.\n\nThe heteronuclear cross-relaxation rate, $\\sigma_{IS}$, between two spins $I$ (here, $^{1}$H) and $S$ (here, $^{13}$C) is given by the expression:\n$$ \\sigma_{IS} = \\frac{1}{10} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\gamma_I^2 \\gamma_S^2}{r_{IS}^6} \\left[ 6J(\\omega_I + \\omega_S) - J(\\omega_I - \\omega_S) \\right] $$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\gamma_I$ and $\\gamma_S$ are the gyromagnetic ratios of the two nuclei, $r_{IS}$ is the internuclear distance, $\\omega_I$ and $\\omega_S$ are their respective Larmor frequencies, and $J(\\omega)$ is the spectral density function.\n\nThe spectral density function $J(\\omega)$ characterizes the motional frequencies of the molecule.

This condition applies to small molecules in non-viscous solutions. Under this condition, the term $(\\omega\\tau_c)^2$ in the denominator is negligible compared to $1$. Therefore, the spectral density function simplifies and becomes independent of frequency:\n$$ J(\\omega) \\approx \\frac{2}{5}\\tau_c $$\nSubstituting this approximation into the equation for the cross-relaxation rate $\\sigma_{IS}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{IS} \\approx \\frac{1}{10} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\gamma_I^2 \\gamma_S^2}{r_{IS}^6} \\left[ 6\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\tau_c\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\tau_c\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{IS} \\approx \\frac{1}{10} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\gamma_I^2 \\gamma_S^2}{r_{IS}^6} \\left[ 5\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\tau_c\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{IS} \\approx \\frac{1}{5} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\gamma_I^2 \\gamma_S^2 \\tau_c}{r_{IS}^6} $$\nThis result shows that under the extreme narrowing condition, the cross-relaxation rate is directly proportional to the rotational correlation time $\\tau_c$ and inversely proportional to the sixth power of the internuclear distance $r_{IS}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{IS} \\propto \\frac{1}{r_{IS}^6} $$\nThe problem states that the NOE contribution, let's call it $N$, is proportional to the heteronuclear cross-relaxation rate, $\\sigma_{CH}$.

The problem states that all other parameters (nuclei, motional regime) are identical, so the constant of proportionality is the same for both interactions.\n\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \\frac{k/r_1^6}{k/r_2^6} $$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.

The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria (e.g., it is not factually unsound, incomplete, or ambiguous).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on first principles.\n\n### Derivation\nThe goal is to find an acquisition protocol that satisfies two independent criteria: minimal saturation error and minimal NOE bias.\n\n**1. Saturation Error Criterion**\nThe longitudinal magnetization, $M_z$, recovers after a pulse according to the Bloch equation. After a $90^\\circ$ pulse, where the initial longitudinal magnetization for the recovery period is $M_z(0) = 0$, the magnetization after a time $t$ is given by:\n$$M_z(t) = M_0 (1 - e^{-t/T_1})$$\nwhere $M_0$ is the equilibrium magnetization and $T_1$ is the spin-lattice relaxation time.\nIn a repeated pulse experiment, the time allowed for relaxation is the repetition time, $T_\\mathrm{R}$. The signal intensity is proportional to the magnetization just before the pulse, $M_z(T_\\mathrm{R})$.\nThe criterion states that the error due to incomplete relaxation must be less than $2\\%$. This means the magnetization must recover to at least $98\\%$ of its equilibrium value, $M_0$.\n$$ \\frac{M_z(T_\\mathrm{R})}{M_0} \\ge 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_z(T_\\mathrm{R})$:\n$$ 1 - e^{-T_\\mathrm{R}/T_1} \\ge 0.98 $$\n$$ e^{-T_\\mathrm{R}/T_1} \\le 0.02 $$\nTo solve for $T_\\mathrm{R}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{T_\\mathrm{R}}{T_1} \\le \\ln(0.02) $$\n$$ \\frac{T_\\mathrm{R}}{T_1} \\ge -\\ln(0.02) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.02}\\right) = \\ln(50) $$\nNumerically, $\\ln(50) \\approx 3.912$. Therefore, the required repetition time is:\n$$ T_\\mathrm{R} \\ge 3.912 \\times T_1 $$\nThis condition must hold for all carbons, so we must use the longest $T_1$ value to ensure even the slowest relaxing carbon meets the criterion. The slowest relaxing carbon is the quaternary carbon, $\\mathrm{C}_\\mathrm{q}$, with $T_1(\\mathrm{C}_\\mathrm{q}) = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$ T_\\mathrm{R} \\ge 3.912 \\times 12.0\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 46.944\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThus, any valid protocol must have a total repetition time $T_\\mathrm{R} = d_1 + t_\\mathrm{aq}$ of at least $46.944\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The common rule of thumb of $T_\\mathrm{R} \\approx 5T_1$ corresponds to an error of $1-e^{-5} \\approx 0.67\\%$, which is well within the $2\\%$ tolerance. For $T_R = 5 T_1$, we would need $T_\\mathrm{R} = 5 \\times 12.0\\,\\mathrm{s} = 60.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Our derived minimum is slightly less strict but more precise to the stated problem.\n\n**2. NOE Bias Criterion**\nThe NOE arises from dipole-dipole cross-relaxation between $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ nuclei and nearby protons. When protons are saturated by broadband decoupling, the population differences of the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ spin states are altered, potentially enhancing the signal by a factor $(1+\\eta)$, where $\\eta$ is the NOE enhancement factor. For a small molecule in the extreme narrowing limit, the maximum theoretical enhancement is $\\eta_\\mathrm{max} = \\gamma_\\mathrm{H} / (2\\gamma_\\mathrm{C}) \\approx 1.988$.\nThe magnitude of the observed NOE depends on the fractional contribution of the dipole-dipole mechanism to the total $T_1$ relaxation of the carbon.\n- Protonated carbons ($\\mathrm{CH}_3$, $\\mathrm{CH}$) are relaxed predominantly by the dipole-dipole mechanism and will exhibit a large NOE, with $\\eta$ approaching $\\eta_\\mathrm{max}$. Their signals can be enhanced by a factor up to $(1 + 1.988) = 2.988$.\n- Quaternary carbons ($\\mathrm{C}_\\mathrm{q}$) have no directly attached protons. Their relaxation is inefficiently driven by dipole-dipole interactions with distant protons, and other mechanisms (e.g., spin-rotation, chemical shift anisotropy) are often competitive or dominant. They will exhibit a small or negligible NOE, so $\\eta \\approx 0$.\nA quantitative experiment requires that the integrals of all carbon signals be directly proportional to the number of nuclei. A differential NOE (e.g., enhancement factor of $\\approx 3$ for $\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\approx 1$ for $\\mathrm{C}_\\mathrm{q}$) violates this proportionality. The $<2\\%$ bias criterion means the enhancement factor $(1+\\eta)$ must be uniform across all carbon types to within $2\\%$. The only practical way to achieve this is to suppress the NOE entirely, such that $\\eta \\approx 0$ for all carbons. The signal would be $(1+\\eta)I_0$, so requiring a bias of less than $2\\%$ means we require $\\eta < 0.02$.\nTo suppress the NOE, the protons must not be saturated during the period when the longitudinal $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ magnetization is recovering. This is achieved with **inverse-gated decoupling**, where the proton decoupler is switched off during the recycle delay ($d_1$) and switched on only during the acquisition time ($t_\\mathrm{aq}$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Continuous broadband $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupling throughout the experiment (recycle and acquisition); $d_1 = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_\\mathrm{aq} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $90^\\circ$ flip angle.**\n- **NOE Criterion**: Continuous decoupling will saturate the protons throughout the experiment, leading to a full, differential NOE. This will introduce a very large bias between protonated and quaternary carbons, far exceeding the $2\\%$ tolerance. This protocol is fundamentally non-quantitative.\n- **Saturation Criterion**: The repetition time is $T_\\mathrm{R} = d_1 + t_\\mathrm{aq} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{s} + 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s} = 11.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The required repetition time is $T_\\mathrm{R} \\ge 46.944\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The chosen $T_\\mathrm{R}$ is far too short, leading to severe saturation of the slower relaxing carbons. For the $\\mathrm{C}_\\mathrm{q}$ ($T_1=12.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$), the saturation error is $1 - (1 - e^{-11.0/12.0}) \\approx 1 - 0.601 = 0.399$, or $39.9\\%$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option fails both criteria.\n\n**B. Inverse-gated decoupling: $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupler off during $d_1$, on only during $t_\\mathrm{aq}$; $d_1 = 24.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_\\mathrm{aq} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $90^\\circ$ flip angle.**\n- **NOE Criterion**: Inverse-gated decoupling is used, which correctly suppresses the NOE. This criterion is met.\n- **Saturation Criterion**: The repetition time is $T_\\mathrm{R} = d_1 + t_\\mathrm{aq} = 24.0\\,\\mathrm{s} + 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s} = 25.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$. This is less than the required $T_\\mathrm{R} \\ge 46.944\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The saturation error for the $\\mathrm{C}_\\mathrm{q}$ ($T_1=12.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$) is $1 - (1 - e^{-25.0/12.0}) \\approx 1 - 0.876 = 0.124$, or $12.4\\%$. This is much greater than the allowed $2\\%$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option fails the saturation criterion.\n\n**C. Inverse-gated decoupling: $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupler off during $d_1$, on only during $t_\\mathrm{aq}$; $d_1 = 48.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_\\mathrm{aq} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $90^\\circ$ flip angle.**\n- **NOE Criterion**: Inverse-gated decoupling is used, which suppresses the NOE during the recycle delay. The problem requires stating the condition for which NOE during acquisition is negligible. The NOE builds up with a time constant on the order of $T_1$. For the NOE bias to be $<2\\%$, the enhancement factor $\\eta(t_\\mathrm{aq})$ must be less than $0.02$. The acquisition time $t_\\mathrm{aq} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is much shorter than the $T_1$ values of the protonated carbons that show large NOE (e.g., $T_1(\\mathrm{CH}) = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$). Since $t_\\mathrm{aq} \\ll T_1$, the NOE will not have time to build up to a significant level during acquisition, so this criterion is met.\n- **Saturation Criterion**: The repetition time is $T_\\mathrm{R} = d_1 + t_\\mathrm{aq} = 48.0\\,\\mathrm{s} + 1.2\\,\\mathrm{s} = 49.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$. This satisfies the condition $T_\\mathrm{R} \\ge 46.944\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Let's calculate the precise error for the $\\mathrm{C}_\\mathrm{q}$ ($T_1=12.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$):\n$$ \\text{Error} = e^{-T_\\mathrm{R}/T_1} = e^{-49.2/12.0} = e^{-4.1} \\approx 0.0166 $$\nThe saturation error is approximately $1.66\\%$, which is less than the required $2\\%$.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option satisfies both the NOE suppression and the saturation criteria.\n\n**D. Partially gated decoupling: $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ decoupler on during the last $5.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$ of $d_1$ and during $t_\\mathrm{aq}$; $d_1 = 48.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_\\mathrm{aq} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $90^\\circ$ flip angle.**\n- **NOE Criterion**: The decoupler is turned on for $5.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$ before the pulse. This allows the NOE to build up for this duration. For the $\\mathrm{CH}$ group ($T_1 = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$), the NOE enhancement will build to a significant fraction of its maximum value. Approximating the buildup time constant with $T_1$, the enhancement factor would be $\\eta(t) \\approx \\eta_\\mathrm{max}(1-e^{-t/T_1}) \\approx 1.988(1-e^{-5.0/6.0}) \\approx 1.988(0.565) \\approx 1.12$. This corresponds to a signal enhancement of $(1+\\eta) \\approx 2.12$, or $112\\%$. The quaternary carbon signal would remain unenhanced. This creates a massive bias, far in excess of the $2\\%$ limit.\n- **Saturation Criterion**: The repetition time is $T_\\mathrm{R} = d_1 + t_\\mathrm{aq} = 48.0\\,\\mathrm{s} + 1.2\\,\\mathrm{s} = 49.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$. As determined for option C, this is sufficient to meet the saturation criterion.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.

Off-resonance irradiation of non-target protons due to the finite radiofrequency bandwidth of the selective saturation pulse.\n- **Theoretical Framework:**\n    - The Solomon equations: $\\frac{d M_i}{d t} = -R_i \\left(M_i - M_i^{0}\\right) - \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\sigma_{ij} \\left(M_j - M_j^{0}\\right)$.\n    - Dipolar cross-relaxation rate: $\\sigma_{ij} \\propto r_{ij}^{-6}$.\n- **Assumptions:**\n    - Rapid molecular tumbling (small correlation time $\\tau_c$), placing the system in the extreme-narrowing regime for heteronuclear dipolar relaxation.\n    - A genuine two-spin NOE build-up on $C_x$ from saturating $H_a$ has an initially linear time dependence, with a slope proportional to $\\sigma_{C_x,H_a}$ if only $H_a$ is saturated.\n    - Off-resonance effects scale with the ratio $(\\omega_1/\\Delta \\omega)$, where $\\omega_1$ is the saturation field strength and $\\Delta \\omega$ is the frequency offset.\n- **Question:** Identify the protocol that most stringently rules out both spin diffusion and off-resonance irradiation, thereby validating a genuine long-range NOE between $C_x$ and $H_a$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based entirely on established principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The Solomon equations are the fundamental theoretical basis for spin relaxation and the NOE in multi-spin systems. The $r_{ij}^{-6}$ dependence of the dipolar cross-relaxation rate is a cornerstone of this theory. The concepts of spin diffusion (relayed NOE), off-resonance saturation, NOE build-up kinetics, and experimental controls like isotope labeling and frequency-offset irradiation are all standard, valid concepts in advanced NMR for structure elucidation. The scenario is scientifically sound and realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear objective: to distinguish a genuine physical effect from two well-defined, common experimental artifacts. It provides sufficient information (distances, potential artifacts, theoretical context) to critically evaluate the efficacy of the proposed protocols. A unique, best answer can be determined by comparing the rigor of the different experimental designs.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity. All terms have unambiguous definitions within the field of NMR spectroscopy.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and poses a non-trivial challenge that requires a deep understanding of NMR experimental design.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe goal is to design a set of experiments that unambiguously demonstrates that the observed NOE enhancement on $C_x$ when irradiating $H_a$ is due to a direct $H_a \\leftrightarrow C_x$ dipolar interaction, and not due to (i) a relayed pathway via an intermediate proton ($H_m$) or (ii) unintentional partial saturation of a nearby proton ($H_b$).\n\n**Analysis of Artifact (i): Spin Diffusion (Relayed NOE)**\nSpin diffusion is a multi-step process: $H_a \\xrightarrow{\\sigma_{H_a H_m}} H_m \\xrightarrow{\\sigma_{H_m C_x}} C_x$. The initial rate of magnetization change for $C_x$ due to a direct NOE from $H_a$ is given by $\\frac{d M_{C_x}}{dt} \\approx \\sigma_{C_x H_a} (M_{H_a} - M_{H_a}^0)$. Upon saturation, $M_{H_a}=0$, so the initial buildup is linear with slope $\\sigma_{C_x H_a}$.\nIn contrast, a relayed effect has a lag period. The magnetization of $H_m$ must first be perturbed, and only then can it transfer magnetization to $C_x$. The initial rate of change for $M_{C_x}$ is zero if the pathway is purely relayed. Thus, the NOE build-up curve, $\\eta(t_s)$, for a relayed effect is sigmoidal, while for a direct effect, it is initially linear.\n- **Test 1: NOE Build-up Kinetics.** By measuring the NOE enhancement, $\\eta$, as a function of the saturation time, $t_s$, and focusing on the initial portion of the curve (short $t_s$), one can distinguish the two. A non-zero initial slope is characteristic of a direct interaction. This test is crucial.\n- **Test 2: Isotopic Substitution.** The most definitive way to test the role of the hypothesized mediator, $H_m$, is to remove it from the proton spin network. Replacing $H_m$ with a deuteron ($D$) dramatically reduces the cross-relaxation rates involving that position because the gyromagnetic ratio of deuterium ($\\gamma_D$) is much smaller than that of a proton ($\\gamma_H$). Since $\\sigma \\propto \\gamma_I^2 \\gamma_S^2$, both the $H_a \\to H_m$ and $H_m \\to C_x$ steps would be severely attenuated. If the NOE on $C_x$ disappears upon deuteration of $H_m$, this is powerful evidence for the spin diffusion pathway.\n\n**Analysis of Artifact (ii): Off-Resonance Irradiation**\nThe selective saturation pulse for $H_a$ has a power profile in the frequency domain that is not infinitely sharp. It may partially affect other protons, like $H_b$. Given that $r_{C_x,H_b} = 2.3\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ is much shorter than $r_{C_x,H_a} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$, even a very small degree of saturation on $H_b$ can produce a large NOE on $C_x$. The direct cross-relaxation rate ratio is $\\sigma_{C_x H_b} / \\sigma_{C_x H_a} = (r_{C_x H_a} / r_{C_x H_b})^6 = (4.5/2.3)^6 \\approx (1.956)^6 \\approx 55$. Thus, a mere $1/55 \\approx 2\\%$ saturation of $H_b$ would mimic the direct NOE from $100\\%$ saturation of $H_a$.\nThe problem states the magnitude of this effect scales with $(\\omega_1 / \\Delta \\omega)$. To rule this out:\n- **Test 3: Power Dependence.** Use the lowest possible RF power, $\\omega_1$, that is sufficient to saturate $H_a$. This minimizes the excitation bandwidth and reduces effects at off-resonant frequencies $\\Delta \\omega$. A genuine direct NOE from $H_a$ should be independent of $\\omega_1$ once saturation is achieved, whereas an artifact from off-resonance irradiation of $H_b$ would decrease as $\\omega_1$ is lowered.\n- **Test 4: Frequency-Offset Control.** This is the most rigorous test. The experiment is repeated, but the irradiation frequency is moved slightly away from the $H_a$ resonance, for example, to frequencies $f_{H_a} + \\delta f$ and $f_{H_a} - \\delta f$. A genuine NOE from $H_a$ will be maximal exactly on-resonance and should decrease symmetrically (or at least significantly) for small offsets. An artifact arising from irradiation of $H_b$ will not show this symmetric dependence on the $H_a$ resonance frequency. Its magnitude will depend on how close the offset irradiation frequency is to the $H_b$ resonance.\n\nA \"most stringent\" protocol must effectively implement tests for both artifacts.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Acquire NOE build-up curves by varying the saturation duration $t_s$ and fit only the long-time points, because relayed pathways are maximized at long $t_s$. Then increase the saturation power $\\omega_1$ until the enhancement no longer changes; if the enhancement plateaus, it must be genuine. No need to modify the molecular system.**\n- This protocol is fundamentally flawed. Analyzing only long-time points merges direct and relayed effects, preventing their distinction. The initial-rate regime is what separates them. Increasing saturation power $\\omega_1$ *worsens* off-resonance effects, making the experiment less selective, not more. A plateau could simply mean that both the target and off-resonance protons are now fully saturated. This approach is counter-productive.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Restrict analysis to the initial linear regime of the build-up $\\eta(t_s)$ for small $t_s$, and verify that the initial slope scales with $r^{-6}$ across carbons at known distances. Deuterate suspected mediator protons (replace $H_m$ by deuterium) and show the $C_x$ enhancement upon saturating $H_a$ disappears. Use low-power, narrow-band selective irradiation to saturate only $H_a$ and perform symmetric frequency-offset controls: move the irradiation by $\\pm \\Delta \\omega$ around the $H_a$ resonance and demonstrate that the enhancement is maximal on-resonance and negligible at matched offsets. Confirm that further reduction of $\\omega_1$ does not change the initial slope once $H_a$ is saturated.**\n- This protocol comprehensively addresses both potential artifacts with the most rigorous methods available.\n- For spin diffusion: It correctly uses analysis of the initial build-up rates (Test 1) and proposes the definitive isotopic labeling experiment (Test 2).\n- For off-resonance effects: It correctly advocates for low-power, selective irradiation and checking for power independence (Test 3), and crucially, includes the gold-standard frequency-offset control experiment (Test 4).\n- This combination of experiments provides multiple, orthogonal checks that leave no ambiguity if all tests support a direct interaction.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Measure the NOE sign as a function of temperature to modulate the molecular correlation time $\\tau_c$; if the sign remains positive over all temperatures, the enhancement must be genuine. Do not perform isotope substitution or offset controls, as temperature variation is sufficient.**\n- The sign of the heteronuclear NOE depends on the product of the Larmor frequency $\\omega$ and the correlation time $\\tau_c$. For the ¹H-{¹³C} pair in the extreme narrowing limit ($\\omega\\tau_c \\ll 1$), the NOE is positive. As $\\tau_c$ increases (e.g., at lower temperature), the NOE decreases, passes through zero, and becomes negative. This behavior is fundamentally tied to the dipole-dipole mechanism itself, not the pathway. A direct NOE, a relayed NOE, and an off-resonance-induced NOE would all exhibit the same dependence on $\\tau_c$. Therefore, this experiment provides no information to distinguish between them. The assertion that this is sufficient is false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Irradiate $H_m$ instead of $H_a$ and compare the magnitude of the $C_x$ enhancement; if $H_m$ irradiation gives a larger enhancement than $H_a$ irradiation, then the original observation was spin diffusion. No further tests are necessary to rule out off-resonance irradiation because selective irradiation is inherently specific.**\n- Irradiating $H_m$ is a useful experiment. Given $r_{C_x,H_m} < r_{C_x,H_a}$, one expects a larger NOE from saturating $H_m$. Observing this would confirm that the $H_m \\to C_x$ pathway is efficient and thus a plausible second step in a spin-diffusion pathway. However, this does not prove that the originally observed NOE was due to spin diffusion. It could still be a combination of a small direct effect and/or an off-resonance effect. The conclusion \"then the original observation was spin diffusion\" is a logical non-sequitur. Furthermore, the statement \"selective irradiation is inherently specific\" is factually incorrect and dismisses the very real problem of finite pulse bandwidth, which is the cause of artifact (ii).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3727583"}]}
