The process involves the resolution of a racemic amine via the formation of diastereomeric salts with a chiral resolving acid.\n\nFirst, we must determine the initial molar quantities of each component.\nThe total amount of racemic amine is given as $n_{0} = 0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}$. Since it is a racemic mixture, it contains equal amounts of the two enantiomers, $A_{R}$ and $A_{S}$.\nThe initial moles of the $R$-enantiomer, $A_{R}$, is:\n$$n_{A_{R}, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{n_{0}}{2} = \\frac{0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{2} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nThe initial moles of the $S$-enantiomer, $A_{S}$, is:\n$$n_{A_{S}, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{n_{0}}{2} = \\frac{0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{2} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nThe amount of the chiral resolving acid, $\\mathrm{RA}$, is given as $0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nThe problem states that complete salt formation occurs. The amine enantiomers react with the resolving acid in a $1:1$ stoichiometric ratio to form two diastereomeric salts, $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$ and $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$.\nThe total amount of $A_{R}$ available is $0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$ and the total amount of $A_{S}$ available is $0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$. The total amount of $\\mathrm{RA}$ is $0.300\\,\\mathrm{mol}$, which is sufficient to react with all of the amine.\nTherefore, the total initial amount of each diastereomeric salt formed is:\nTotal moles of $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$ is $n_{R, \\text{total}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\nTotal moles of $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$ is $n_{S, \\text{total}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nThese salts are then equilibrated in a mother liquor of volume $V = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{L}$. The salts dissolve according to their respective solubilities until the solution is saturated.

The problem assumes ideal solution behavior and pure solid phases, which implies that the solubility of each diastereomer is independent of the other.\n\nWe first check if there is enough of each salt to saturate the solution. The maximum amount of each salt that can dissolve in the given volume of solvent is:\nFor $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$:\n$$n_{R, \\text{dissolved}} = s_{R} \\times V = (0.050\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.500\\,\\mathrm{L}) = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nFor $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$:\n$$n_{S, \\text{dissolved}} = s_{S} \\times V = (0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.500\\,\\mathrm{L}) = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n\nComparing the total amount of each salt with the amount that can dissolve:\nFor $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$: $n_{R, \\text{total}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol} > n_{R, \\text{dissolved}} = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.

This means the solution will also be saturated with $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$, and some of it will remain as a solid.\n\nThe solid fraction, or filter cake, is composed of the undissolved portion of each diastereomeric salt. We can calculate the amount of each salt in the solid phase by subtracting the dissolved amount from the total amount.\nMoles of solid $A_{R}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$:\n$$n_{R, \\text{solid}} = n_{R, \\text{total}} - n_{R, \\text{dissolved}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol} - 0.025\\,\\mathrm{mol} = 0.125\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\nMoles of solid $A_{S}\\cdot \\mathrm{RA}$:\n$$n_{S, \\text{solid}} = n_{S, \\text{total}} - n_{S, \\text{dissolved}} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol} - 0.075\\,\\mathrm{mol} = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n\nThe problem states that this solid fraction is isolated and neutralized to regenerate the free amine enantiomers. The process of regeneration liberates the amine from its salt. Thus, the number of moles of each regenerated amine enantiomer is equal to the number of moles of its corresponding salt in the solid fraction.\nMoles of regenerated amine $A_{R}$: $n_{A_{R}, \\text{final}} = n_{R, \\text{solid}} = 0.125\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\nMoles of regenerated amine $A_{S}$: $n_{A_{S}, \\text{final}} = n_{S, \\text{solid}} = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the enantiomeric excess ($ee$) of the regenerated amine mixture.

The starting material is racemic, meaning the initial ratio of enantiomers is $1{:}1$. When reacted with a chiral derivatizing agent, the two enantiomers react at different rates ($k_R \\neq k_S$), a phenomenon called kinetic resolution. If the reaction is stopped before completion, the product ratio will reflect the ratio of the rate constants ($k_R/k_S$), not the initial ratio of reactants. For the product ratio to accurately reflect the initial reactant ratio, the reaction must go to completion. The provided experimental data (residual starting material, reagent-related signals) suggests the reaction is incomplete. We must evaluate which statements correctly identify this situation.\n\n#### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Monitoring the diastereomeric LC–MS peak area ratio as a function of reaction time $t$; if the ratio converges toward $1{:}1$ as $t \\to \\infty$, the initial $70{:}30$ arises from incomplete derivatization with unequal apparent rate constants for the two enantiomers, not true enantiomeric excess.**\n- **Justification:** This statement correctly describes the behavior of a kinetic resolution on a racemic substrate. Initially, the product ratio reflects the kinetic preference ($k_{major}/k_{minor} \\approx 70/30$). As the reaction proceeds, the faster-reacting enantiomer is consumed more quickly. To consume all starting material (which is racemic, 1:1), the final product mixture must also be 1:1. Therefore, observing the ratio converge to $1{:}1$ over time is a definitive diagnostic test for a kinetic artifact. If the substrate had a true $70{:}30$ ee, the product ratio would be $70{:}30$ at completion.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. High-resolution MS detection of either an $M{:}M{+}2$ isotope pattern with approximately $3{:}1$ intensity (consistent with a chlorine-containing ion at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{MTPACl}}$) or a strong ion at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{MTPA}}$ lacking the chlorine isotope pattern (consistent with hydrolyzed Mosher acid), contemporaneous with the sample, indicates reagent carryover or decomposition that undermines inference of true enantiomeric excess.**\n- **Justification:** MTPACl contains one chlorine atom, which gives a characteristic $3{:}1$ $M{:}M{+}2$ isotope pattern. Detecting this confirms unreacted reagent. MTPA (from hydrolysis) would lack this pattern. The presence of either species proves the reaction is incomplete or has side reactions, which are the necessary conditions for a kinetic resolution artifact. Therefore, observing these reagent-related species provides strong evidence that the reaction is not quantitative, and any observed product ratio may not reflect the true initial ee.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. In $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ NMR of the crude reaction mixture, the presence of an additional sharp $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ signal beyond the two broader diastereomer resonances which diminishes upon addition of a stoichiometric base, is consistent with residual Mosher acid chloride or its hydrolysis product rather than true enantiomeric excess.**\n- **Justification:** The large diastereomeric esters tumble slowly, giving broad NMR signals. The smaller reagent/hydrolysis product tumbles faster, giving a sharp signal. MTPA and its hydrolysis product (MTPA acid, along with HCl byproduct) are acidic. Adding a base will react with them, changing their chemical structure and thus altering or removing their $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ NMR signal. This confirms the presence of reagent-related species, indicating an incomplete reaction, which is the source of kinetic artifacts. This observation thus supports the hypothesis that the $70{:}30$ ratio is an artifact.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. If the sum of integrated LC–MS areas of the two diastereomer peaks at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\Delta m$ equals the integrated area of the underivatized analyte at $m/z = m_{\\mathrm{A}}$, then true enantiomeric excess is confirmed.**\n- **Justification:** This statement is fundamentally flawed. First, it assumes the MS response factor is identical for different chemical species (analyte vs. ester products), which is invalid. Second, a 50% conversion is precisely the condition where kinetic resolution artifacts are maximized. This observation would strongly *support* the possibility of a kinetic artifact, not confirm a true enantiomeric excess.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Equal intensities of the two diastereomeric $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ signals but unequal integrals of the corresponding diastereotopic $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ methoxy signals necessarily indicate instrument nonlinearity and therefore do not reflect any chemical artifact.**\n- **Justification:** This statement is a distractor. It posits a scenario (1:1 ratio by $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ NMR) that contradicts the problem's premise (70:30 ratio by LC-MS). If $^{19}\\mathrm{F}$ integrals for the diastereomers were equal, their concentrations would be equal. A discrepancy with $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ integrals would point to an NMR experimental error, not \"instrument nonlinearity\" in this context, and is irrelevant to diagnosing the LC-MS result.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Repeating the derivatization under matched partial-conversion conditions with the enantiomeric reagent $(S)$-MTPACl yields a diastereomer ratio of $30{:}70$ (the reciprocal of the original $70{:}30$); this inversion implicates kinetic bias or reagent decomposition rather than true enantiomeric excess in the substrate.**\n- **Justification:** This is a definitive control experiment. A kinetic resolution effect depends on the diastereomeric relationship between the substrate and the reagent. Switching the reagent's chirality from $(R)$ to $(S)$ inverts all stereochemical relationships. The transition state that was favored is now disfavored, and vice-versa. This causes the kinetic product ratio to invert. If the substrate had a true $70{:}30$ ee, the product ratio would remain $70{:}30$ regardless of the reagent's chirality. Therefore, observing the ratio invert to $30{:}70$ is a classic proof of a kinetic artifact.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCF}$$", "id": "3696435"}]}
