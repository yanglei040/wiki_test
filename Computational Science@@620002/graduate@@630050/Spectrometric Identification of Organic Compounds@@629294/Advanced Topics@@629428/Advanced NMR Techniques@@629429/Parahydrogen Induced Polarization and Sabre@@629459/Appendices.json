At such temperatures, the populations of higher rotational levels are negligible due to the exponential Boltzmann factor. The energy of the rotational levels increases with $J(J+1)$, causing terms for higher $J$ to decrease rapidly.\n\nLet's evaluate the coefficients $J(J+1)$ for the first few levels:\n-   $J=0$: $0(1)=0$\n-   $J=1$: $1(2)=2$\n-   $J=2$: $2(3)=6$\n-   $J=3$: $3(4)=12$\n\nAt low temperature $T$, the term $\\exp(-\\Theta_r J(J+1)/T)$ will be significant for $J=0$ and $J=1$, but will become very small for $J=2$ and higher. To justify the truncation, we observe that the argument of the exponential for $J=2$ is three times larger than for $J=1$, and for $J=3$ it is six times larger. Thus, the population of states with $J \\ge 2$ will be much smaller than those for $J=0$ and $J=1$. For a solution requiring four significant figures, it is prudent to include the $J=2$ term to ensure accuracy, while we can safely neglect terms for $J \\ge 3$.\n\nTruncating the sums to include only the $J=0, 1, 2$ levels:\n-   $Z_{\\text{para}}(T) \\approx (2(0)+1)\\exp(0) + (2(2)+1)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{6\\Theta_r}{T}\\right) = 1 + 5\\exp\\left(-\\frac{6\\Theta_r}{T}\\right)$\n-   $Z_{\\text{ortho}}(T) \\approx 3(2(1)+1)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Theta_r}{T}\\right) = 9\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Theta_r}{T}\\right)$\n\nSubstituting these into the relation $9 Z_{\\text{ortho}}(T) = Z_{\\text{para}}(T)$:\n$$\n9 \\left[ 9\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Theta_r}{T}\\right) \\right] = 1 + 5\\exp\\left(-\\frac{6\\Theta_r}{T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n81\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Theta_r}{T}\\right) = 1 + 5\\exp\\left(-\\frac{6\\Theta_r}{T}\\right)\n$$\nLet $x = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Theta_r}{T}\\right)$.

We can solve this equation iteratively. Rearranging to $x = (1 + 5x^3)/81$, we can start with an initial guess. A first-order approximation neglecting the $5x^3$ term gives $x_0 \\approx 1/81$.\nLet's use this as the starting point for iteration:\n$x_0 = 1/81 \\approx 0.012345679$\n$x_1 = \\frac{1 + 5x_0^3}{81} = \\frac{1 + 5(1/81)^3}{81} = \\frac{1}{81} + \\frac{5}{81^4} \\approx 0.012345679 + 1.1615 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 0.012345795$\nFor the next iteration:\n$x_2 = \\frac{1 + 5x_1^3}{81} \\approx \\frac{1 + 5(0.012345795)^3}{81} \\approx \\frac{1 + 5(1.8817 \\times 10^{-6})}{81} = \\frac{1.0000094085}{81} \\approx 0.012345795$\nThe value has converged to sufficient precision.

In SABRE, $P_b^{\\ast}$ is large and negative (by convention), and we can consider the magnitude of polarization without loss of generality, or redefine $P_b^{\\ast}$ as a positive quantity for build-up. The problem models build-up towards a positive $P_\\infty$, so we proceed with a positive $P_b^{\\ast}$.\n\n2.  **Relaxation Process**: Longitudinal relaxation causes the polarization to decay towards its thermal equilibrium value, which is effectively zero compared to the hyperpolarized state.

This process is described by the first-order differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d P_z(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{P_z(t) - P_{\\mathrm{th}}}{T_1}\n$$\nThe solution to this equation for an initial condition $P_z(0)$ is:\n$$\nP_z(t) = P_{\\mathrm{th}} + (P_z(0) - P_{\\mathrm{th}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the system is hyperpolarized at $t=0$ to an initial polarization $P_z(0) = P_S$. The detection occurs after a reaction interval $t_r$. Therefore, the polarization of the hyperpolarized sample just before the detection pulse is:\n$$\nP_{z, \\text{hyper}} = P_z(t_r) = P_{\\mathrm{th}} + (P_S - P_{\\mathrm{th}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_r}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nThe reference sample is at thermal equilibrium, so its polarization is $P_{z, \\text{th}} = P_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal, $S$, acquired immediately following a radiofrequency pulse with flip angle $\\alpha$, is proportional to the magnitude of the transverse magnetization generated by the pulse. This transverse magnetization is obtained by projecting the longitudinal polarization, $P_z$, onto the transverse plane, yielding a signal proportional to $P_z \\sin(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe signal amplitude for the hyperpolarized sample is:\n$$\nS_{\\text{hyper}} \\propto P_{z, \\text{hyper}} \\sin(\\alpha)\n$$\nThe signal amplitude for the thermal equilibrium sample is:\n$$\nS_{\\text{th}} \\propto P_{z, \\text{th}} \\sin(\\alpha) = P_{\\mathrm{th}} \\sin(\\alpha)\n$$\nThe enhancement factor $\\epsilon$ is the ratio of these two signals. Since the same flip angle $\\alpha$ is used for both measurements, the $\\sin(\\alpha)$ term cancels:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{S_{\\text{hyper}}}{S_{\\text{th}}} = \\frac{P_{z, \\text{hyper}} \\sin(\\alpha)}{P_{\\mathrm{th}} \\sin(\\alpha)} = \\frac{P_{z, \\text{hyper}}}{P_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{z, \\text{hyper}}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{th}} + (P_S - P_{\\mathrm{th}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_r}{T_1}\\right)}{P_{\\mathrm{th}}} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{P_S}{P_{\\mathrm{th}}} - 1\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_r}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nTo evaluate this expression, we first compute the thermal equilibrium polarization $P_{\\mathrm{th}}$ using the provided high-temperature approximation and constants:\n$P_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx \\frac{\\gamma \\hbar B_0}{2 k_B T}$.\nGiven values are:\n$\\gamma = 2.675 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{rad} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{T}^{-1}$\n$\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\, \\text{s}$\n$B_0 = 9.4 \\, \\text{T}$\n$k_B = 1.381 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J} \\, \\text{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 298 \\, \\text{K}$\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx \\frac{(2.675 \\times 10^8) (1.054 \\times 10^{-34}) (9.4)}{2 (1.381 \\times 10^{-23}) (298)} \\approx \\frac{2.650559 \\times 10^{-25}}{8.23116 \\times 10^{-21}} \\approx 3.2199 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the relaxation decay factor with $t_r = 5 \\, \\text{s}$ and $T_1 = 30 \\, \\text{s}$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_r}{T_1}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5}{30}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\approx 0.84648\n$$\nNow we can substitute these intermediate results, along with the given initial polarization $P_S = 0.85$, into the expression for $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = 1 + \\left(\\frac{0.85}{3.2199 \\times 10^{-5}} - 1\\right) (0.84648)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon \\approx 1 + (26398.3 - 1) (0.84648)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon \\approx 1 + (26397.3) (0.84648) \\approx 1 + 22346.7\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon \\approx 22347.7\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\epsilon \\approx 22300\n$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation to unambiguously show three significant figures gives $2.23 \\times 10^4$.
