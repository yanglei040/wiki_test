This practice problem moves from pure calculation to practical, real-world diagnostics, asking you to devise a robust protocol to distinguish true conformational exchange from other common phenomena like unresolved $J$-couplings or sample impurities. This exercise hones the critical thinking skills needed to design experiments that provide unambiguous evidence for dynamic processes. [@problem_id:3697679]", "problem": "An advanced research group examines a substituted cyclohexanone that exhibits two interconverting chair conformations in solution.

At the same temperature but at $B_0$ corresponding to $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ for $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, the feature is broader in hertz and appears closer to incipient splitting, whereas other well-resolved singlets remain narrow. A nearby methylene group shows a complex multiplet at both fields. The sample is a reaction mixture that may contain minor impurities.\n\nFrom first principles of NMR line formation and chemical exchange, develop physically testable criteria that distinguish conformational exchange broadening from either unresolved scalar-coupling multiplicity or the presence of impurities. Then, propose a verification protocol using both variable-temperature and field-variation experiments that would confirm conformational exchange and rule out the alternatives in a scientifically robust way. Choose the option that best satisfies these requirements.\n\nA. Identify exchange by the appearance of a single averaged resonance whose full width at half maximum (FWHM, in hertz) increases markedly with $B_0$ at fixed $T$, accompanied by temperature-dependent coalescence and re-separation consistent with an Eyring dependence of the exchange rate. Specifically: at fixed $T$, if the two conformers differ by a chemical shift of $\\Delta \\delta$ (in parts per million), then the frequency difference is $\\Delta \\nu = \\nu_0 \\Delta \\delta$ (in hertz) with $\\nu_0 \\propto B_0$, and in the fast-exchange regime the exchange-induced transverse relaxation rate scales as $1/T_{2,\\mathrm{ex}} \\propto (\\Delta \\omega)^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ with $\\Delta \\omega = 2\\pi \\Delta \\nu$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$; thus the FWHM in hertz increases with $B_0^2$. Lowering $T$ reduces $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, so lines sharpen and split into two at sufficiently low $T$, while raising $T$ causes broadening and coalescence into one line. Increasing $B_0$ at fixed $T$ moves the system toward slower exchange because $\\Delta \\nu$ increases, so a single broad line at lower field may broaden further and begin to resolve into two at higher field. In contrast, unresolved multiplicity from scalar couplings is characterized by field-independent coupling constants $J$ (in hertz) and second-order patterns that become more first-order at higher $B_0$; hence multiplet complexity simplifies rather than showing exchange-type coalescence, and FWHM arising from overlap does not scale as $B_0^2$. Impurity peaks neither coalesce nor exchange with the main component upon temperature variation, and their integrals do not repartition in a way consistent with intramolecular site exchange. Verification protocol: record spectra at two $B_0$ values across a temperature series, extract FWHM (in hertz) versus $B_0$ at fixed $T$ and versus $T$ at fixed $B_0$, demonstrate coalescence temperatures that shift with $B_0$ according to $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta \\nu)$, and fit $\\ln(k_{\\mathrm{ex}}/T)$ versus $1/T$ to the Eyring equation for activation parameters; separately, verify that any multiplet spacings (in hertz) remain constant with $B_0$ and that suspected impurity resonances neither change intensity ratios with $T$ nor show coherent coalescence with the exchanging sites.\n\nB. Identify exchange by the decrease of FWHM (in hertz) with increasing $B_0$ due to motional narrowing, and confirm by the increase of scalar coupling constants $J$ (in hertz) with $B_0$ at fixed $T$. With warming, both impurity peaks and exchanging conformers should coalesce into single lines because higher temperature always narrows lines; therefore, variable-temperature data are not diagnostic. Verification protocol: rely primarily on shimming and solvent suppression at higher $B_0$ to assess whether broad features sharpen; if they do, attribute them to exchange.\n\nC. Identify exchange by the invariance of chemical shift separations (in hertz) with $B_0$ at fixed $T$, since chemical shifts are reported in parts per million, and by the disappearance of broad features upon warming due only to decreased viscosity. Consider $J$-coupling multiplicities as $B_0$-dependent because stronger fields reveal more couplings, so unresolved multiplicity can be ruled out if the pattern does not gain additional lines at higher $B_0$. Verification protocol: use only a single $B_0$, vary $T$ modestly, and attribute any sharpening upon warming to resolution of overlap rather than exchange; do not attempt quantitative analysis of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}(T)$.\n\nD. Identify exchange by observing that integrals of all peaks remain strictly constant with $T$ at fixed $B_0$ and that diffusion coefficients increase with $T$. Confirm unresolved multiplicity by fitting an Eyring plot for the apparent linewidth to extract an activation enthalpy for coupling. Verification protocol: do not vary $B_0$ because field dependence introduces artifacts; instead, measure linewidths versus $T$ at a single field and attribute any linear Arrhenius or Eyring behavior to multiplicity, and any non-linearity to impurities.", "solution": "The problem statement is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System:** A substituted cyclohexanone with two interconverting chair conformations.\n- **NMR Signal of Interest:** A methine signal from a stereogenic center.\n- **Observation at Field 1:** At a magnetic field $B_0$ corresponding to a $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ frequency of $300\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ and temperature $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the signal is a single broadened feature.\n- **Observation at Field 2:** At the same temperature ($T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$) but at a higher field $B_0$ corresponding to a $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ frequency of $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$, the signal is broader in units of hertz ($\\mathrm{Hz}$) and shows signs of incipient splitting.\n- **Control Observation 1:** Other well-resolved singlets in the spectrum remain narrow at both magnetic fields.\n- **Control Observation 2:** A nearby methylene group exhibits a complex multiplet at both fields.\n- **Sample Composition:** The sample is a reaction mixture, which may contain minor impurities.\n- **Task:** Develop criteria and a verification protocol to distinguish conformational exchange broadening from (a) unresolved scalar-coupling multiplicity and (b) the presence of impurities. The protocol should use both variable-temperature and variable-field experiments.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the well-established principles of dynamic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The system (cyclohexanone interconversion) is a canonical example of conformational exchange. The observations are consistent with established theory: exchange broadening is known to be dependent on both temperature and magnetic field strength. The task of distinguishing exchange from other line-broadening phenomena like unresolved coupling or the presence of multiple static species (impurities) is a fundamental and practical challenge in spectral analysis. The problem is well-posed, asking for a general protocol based on physical principles rather than a numerical solution. The language is objective and uses standard terminology. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe analysis rests on the distinct dependencies of three phenomena—conformational exchange, scalar coupling, and the presence of impurities—on temperature ($T$) and magnetic field strength ($B_0$).\n\n**1. Conformational Exchange:**\nThe interconversion between two conformations, $A \\rightleftharpoons B$, is characterized by an exchange rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. The NMR lineshape depends on the relationship between $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and the difference in resonance frequency between the two sites, $\\Delta\\nu$.\n\n- **Field Dependence:** The chemical shift difference in parts per million ($\\Delta\\delta$) is a molecular property and is independent of $B_0$. However, the frequency difference in hertz ($\\mathrm{Hz}$) is given by $\\Delta\\nu = \\nu_0 \\Delta\\delta$, where $\\nu_0$ is the spectrometer frequency (e.g., $300\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ or $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$). Since $\\nu_0$ is directly proportional to $B_0$, it follows that $\\Delta\\nu \\propto B_0$.\n- In the fast-exchange regime ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\gg \\Delta\\nu$), a single, population-averaged peak is observed. The contribution of the exchange process to the line broadening (and thus to the transverse relaxation rate, $1/T_2$) is given by:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2,\\mathrm{ex}}} \\propto (\\Delta\\omega)^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}} = (2\\pi\\Delta\\nu)^2 / k_{\\mathrm{ex}} $$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx 1/k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is the mean lifetime of the conformers. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the resonance, $\\Delta\\nu_{1/2}$, is proportional to $1/T_2$. Therefore, the exchange contribution to the linewidth in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu_{1/2, \\mathrm{ex}} \\propto (\\Delta\\nu)^2 / k_{\\mathrm{ex}} $$\nAt a fixed temperature $T$, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is constant. Since $\\Delta\\nu \\propto B_0$, the exchange broadening scales quadratically with the magnetic field: $\\Delta\\nu_{1/2, \\mathrm{ex}} \\propto B_0^2$. This explains the observation that the line is broader in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ at $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ than at $300\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$.\n- **Coalescence:** The transition from two separate peaks (slow exchange) to a single peak (fast exchange) occurs at the coalescence point, where $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx \\Delta\\nu$. Since $\\Delta\\nu$ increases with $B_0$, a system that is in fast or intermediate exchange at a low field can be pushed towards the intermediate or slow exchange regime by increasing $B_0$. This is consistent with the observation of \"incipient splitting\" at the higher field.\n\n- **Temperature Dependence:** The rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is strongly dependent on temperature, typically following the Eyring equation:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\frac{k_B T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G^\\ddagger / RT} $$\nwhere $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is the Gibbs free energy of activation. Lowering $T$ decreases $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, pushing the system toward the slow-exchange limit. This will cause a single coalesced peak to first broaden, then split (\"decoalesce\") into two separate, sharper signals corresponding to the individual conformers. Conversely, warming from the slow-exchange regime causes broadening and eventual coalescence. The coalescence temperature, $T_c$, is the temperature at which $k_{\\mathrm{ex }}(T_c) \\approx \\Delta\\nu$. Since $\\Delta\\nu$ depends on $B_0$, $T_c$ will be higher at higher $B_0$. Quantitative analysis of $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ as a function of $T$ (via lineshape fitting) allows for the determination of activation parameters ($\\Delta H^\\ddagger$, $\\Delta S^\\ddagger$) from an Eyring plot of $\\ln(k_{\\mathrm{ex}}/T)$ versus $1/T$.\n\n**2. Unresolved Scalar ($J$) Coupling:**\n- **Field Dependence:** Scalar coupling constants, $J$, are mediated through bonding electrons and are expressed in $\\mathrm{Hz}$. They are **independent** of the external magnetic field $B_0$. A multiplet structure that is unresolved at low field might become better resolved at high field. This is because second-order effects, which can complicate and broaden patterns, become less significant as the ratio $\\Delta\\nu/J$ increases. Thus, increasing $B_0$ (which increases $\\Delta\\nu$) simplifies the spectrum, which is the opposite of the observed exchange-induced broadening.\n- **Temperature Dependence:** $J$-couplings are generally considered to be independent of temperature, or only very weakly dependent. They do not exhibit the dramatic broadening and coalescence behavior associated with a thermally activated exchange process.\n\n**3. Presence of Impurities:**\n- **Field and Temperature Dependence:** Impurities are distinct chemical species. They do not interconvert with the molecule of interest. Therefore, their NMR signals will not coalesce with the signals of the main compound upon changes in temperature. An impurity peak might accidentally overlap with a signal from the main compound, creating a broad feature. However, varying $T$ or $B_0$ would typically resolve this overlap, as the chemical shifts of the two species would likely respond differently. The relative integral (area) of an impurity peak compared to a peak from the main species reflects their molar ratio and should be independent of temperature. In contrast, the relative integrals of two exchanging conformers (at low temperature, below coalescence) will be temperature-dependent if their ground-state energies differ ($\\Delta G \\neq 0$), following a Boltzmann distribution.\n\n**Proposed Verification Protocol:**\nA robust protocol must systematically test these distinct dependencies.\n1.  **Vary $B_0$ at a fixed $T$:** Measure the FWHM of the broadened peak in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ at multiple fields (e.g., $300\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ and $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$). For exchange, the FWHM should increase with $B_0$. For unresolved coupling or impurity overlap, it should not scale in this predictable way and may even decrease (become better resolved).\n2.  **Vary $T$ at a fixed $B_0$:** Record a series of spectra over a wide temperature range. For exchange, one should observe either decoalescence upon cooling or sharpening upon warming from coalescence. Rule out impurities by verifying that no peaks simply separate without the characteristic broadening and re-sharpening behavior of exchange. The relative peak integrals of any suspected impurities should be constant with temperature.\n3.  **Combine $T$ and $B_0$ Variation:** Determine the coalescence temperature, $T_c$, at two different fields. $T_c$ should be higher at the higher $B_0$, confirming that coalescence depends on $\\Delta\\nu(B_0)$.\n4.  **Quantitative Analysis:** Perform lineshape analysis on the variable-temperature data to extract $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ at each temperature. Construct an Eyring plot ($\\ln(k_{\\mathrm{ex}}/T)$ vs. $1/T$) to confirm a linear relationship, from which thermodynamic activation parameters can be derived. This provides definitive proof of a dynamic chemical process.\n5.  **Control Analysis:** Confirm that splittings (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$) in other multiplets (like the nearby methylene group) are constant with $B_0$, verifying the expected behavior of $J$-couplings.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option correctly identifies the key diagnostic features of conformational exchange.\n- It correctly states that the FWHM in hertz ($\\mathrm{Hz}$) increases with $B_0$ and correctly provides the physical reason: $\\Delta\\nu_{1/2, \\mathrm{ex}} \\propto (\\Delta\\nu)^2 \\propto B_0^2$.\n- It accurately describes the temperature-dependent coalescence and decoalescence phenomena and the use of the Eyring equation.\n- It correctly notes that increasing $B_0$ at fixed $T$ moves the system towards the slow-exchange regime because $\\Delta\\nu$ increases, which perfectly explains the observation of \"incipient splitting\" at $600\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$.\n- It correctly contrasts this behavior with that of scalar coupling ($J$ is field-independent in $\\mathrm{Hz}$, patterns become first-order at high field) and impurities (no coalescence, constant relative integrals).\n- The proposed verification protocol is comprehensive and scientifically rigorous, incorporating variation of both $T$ and $B_0$, quantitative analysis via an Eyring plot, and the use of control signals.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option contains multiple fundamental errors.\n- It claims the FWHM (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$) *decreases* with increasing $B_0$.

This is false; $J$ in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ is field-independent.\n- It wrongly states that impurity peaks coalesce upon warming and that higher temperature \"always narrows lines.\" Warming an exchanging system from the slow exchange-regime initially *broadens* the lines up to coalescence. Impurities do not coalesce with the main component.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option is also rife with errors.\n- It claims that chemical shift separations in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ are invariant with $B_0$. This is false; the separation in $\\mathrm{Hz}$, $\\Delta\\nu$, is proportional to $B_0$. The separation in ppm, $\\Delta\\delta$, is what is invariant.\n- It attributes sharpening on warming solely to decreased viscosity, which is an oversimplification that ignores the dominant role of the exchange rate $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.\n- Its description of $J$-coupling dependence on $B_0$ is confused and incorrect.\n- The proposed protocol is weak, advocating against using variable $B_0$ and quantitative analysis, which are essential for a robust conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option introduces nonsensical physics.\n- It incorrectly claims integrals of exchanging peaks remain \"strictly constant\" with $T$. This is only true if the conformers are degenerate ($\\Delta G = 0$). For non-degenerate conformers, their populations and thus integrals (at low $T$) vary with temperature.\n- The main flaw is the suggestion to \"Confirm unresolved multiplicity by fitting an Eyring plot... to extract an activation enthalpy for coupling.\" Scalar coupling is a quantum mechanical interaction, not a thermally activated kinetic process. It does not follow an Eyring or Arrhenius law, and the concept of an \"activation enthalpy for coupling\" is meaningless.\n- The protocol's advice to not vary $B_0$ discards one of the most powerful diagnostic tools.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3697679"}, {"introduction": "Not all dynamic processes manifest as dramatic line broadening or coalescence; some of the most interesting exchange phenomena are 'invisible' in a standard one-dimensional spectrum.

A $7\\,\\mathrm{T}$ magnet corresponds to a proton Larmor frequency $\\nu_0 = (\\gamma_p/2\\pi) B_0 \\approx (42.577\\,\\mathrm{MHz/T})(7\\,\\mathrm{T}) \\approx 298\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$, which is consistent with the given value of $300\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. The values for frequency offsets ($\\Delta\\nu = 10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$), populations, and exchange rates are all physically realistic for conformational dynamics of molecules like amides. The phenomenon described—exchange contributing to transverse relaxation and causing subtle line shape distortions—is a well-documented effect known as exchange broadening, detectable via relaxation dispersion experiments. The problem is scientifically sound.\n\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for a mechanistic explanation and a detection strategy based on a clearly defined physical system and a set of quantitative parameters. The relative timescales of exchange and frequency separation define a specific physical regime. The exchange rate is $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx 1/\\tau_c \\approx 1/(2\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 500\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The maximum frequency difference between sites is $|\\Omega_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\Omega_{\\mathrm{C}}| = |2\\pi \\times 10 - (-2\\pi \\times 10)|\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 40\\pi\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 126\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} > |\\Omega_i - \\Omega_j|$ for all pairs $i,j$, the system is in the fast exchange regime on the chemical shift timescale. In this regime, a single averaged resonance is expected, consistent with the problem description. The question is structured to elicit a specific and unique answer based on established NMR theory.\n\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. All necessary parameters and conceptual frameworks (Bloch equations, Markovian exchange) are explicitly stated.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a valid and standard scenario in advanced NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n### Mechanistic Explanation and Derivation\n\nThe evolution of transverse magnetization $M_+ = M_x + iM_y$ in the rotating frame for a spin subject to a time-dependent frequency offset $\\Omega(t)$ and intrinsic transverse relaxation $R_{2,0}$ is given by the Bloch equation:\n$$ \\frac{dM_+}{dt} = -i\\Omega(t) M_+ - R_{2,0} M_+ $$\nThe spin nucleus stochastically jumps between three conformational states ($\\mathrm{A, B, C}$), and its frequency offset $\\Omega(t)$ accordingly jumps between the values $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the system is in the fast exchange regime, where the exchange rate $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is much greater than the frequency differences between the sites, i.e., $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\gg |\\Omega_i - \\Omega_j|$. In this limit, the precessing spins experience an environment that is the population-weighted average of the individual conformer environments. The observed resonance frequency is the average frequency, $\\langle \\Omega \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle\\Omega\\rangle = \\sum_{i=\\mathrm{A,B,C}} p_i \\Omega_i = (0.50)(0) + (0.30)(2\\pi \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) + (0.20)(-2\\pi \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\langle\\Omega\\rangle = (6\\pi - 4\\pi)\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 2\\pi\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThis corresponds to a frequency shift of $\\langle\\nu\\rangle = \\langle\\Omega\\rangle / (2\\pi) = 1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is consistent with a single peak centered near the reference.\n\nHowever, the rapid stochastic modulation of the frequency around this average value provides an additional, incoherent mechanism for the dephasing of transverse magnetization. This adds a contribution, $R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, to the total transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\mathrm{eff}} = R_{2,0} + R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. In the fast exchange (or motional narrowing) limit, where the correlation time for frequency fluctuations, $\\tau_c$, is short, relaxation theory predicts that this exchange contribution is proportional to the variance of the frequency fluctuation and the correlation time:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx \\langle (\\delta\\Omega)^2 \\rangle \\tau_c $$\nwhere $\\delta\\Omega = \\Omega(t) - \\langle\\Omega\\rangle$ is the instantaneous frequency deviation. The variance is the population-weighted mean square deviation:\n$$ \\langle (\\delta\\Omega)^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{i} p_i (\\Omega_i - \\langle\\Omega\\rangle)^2 $$\n$$ \\langle (\\delta\\Omega)^2 \\rangle = 0.50(0 - 2\\pi)^2 + 0.30(2\\pi \\times 10 - 2\\pi)^2 + 0.20(-2\\pi \\times 10 - 2\\pi)^2 $$\n$$ \\langle (\\delta\\Omega)^2 \\rangle = (4\\pi^2)[0.50(1)^2 + 0.30(9)^2 + 0.20(-11)^2] $$\n$$ \\langle (\\delta\\Omega)^2 \\rangle = (4\\pi^2)[0.50 + 0.30(81) + 0.20(121)] = (4\\pi^2)[0.50 + 24.3 + 24.2] = 4\\pi^2(49) = 196\\pi^2 \\,(\\mathrm{rad/s})^2 $$\nWith $\\tau_c \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the exchange contribution is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx (196\\pi^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2})(2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 3.87\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThis constitutes a significant broadening of the resonance line. A more complete treatment using the Bloch-McConnell equations reveals that the lineshape is not a perfect Lorentzian. The exchange process couples magnetization components from different sites, leading to a complex lineshape that can be approximated as a single broadened peak but contains subtle contributions that manifest as deviations from pure Lorentzian absorption. These can appear as dispersive features mixed into the absorptive signal, resulting in the observed non-Lorentzian profile and baseline curvature.\n\n### Proposed Detection Strategy\n\nTo detect and quantify this exchange process, one must use a technique that is sensitive to relaxation contributions on the timescale of the exchange. Relaxation dispersion (RD) experiments are designed for this purpose. The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiment is a cornerstone of RD studies. It applies a train of refocusing $180^\\circ$ pulses with a frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$. These pulses refocus dephasing due to static frequency offsets but interact non-trivially with the time-dependent frequency modulation from chemical exchange.\n\nThe effective transverse relaxation rate, $R_{2,\\text{eff}}$, becomes a function of $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$.\n-   At low pulse frequencies ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} \\ll k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$), the spin evolves for long periods between pulses, allowing exchange-induced dephasing to occur fully. Thus, $R_{2,\\text{eff}}$ includes the full $R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ contribution.\n-   At high pulse frequencies ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$), the frequent refocusing pulses effectively \"quench\" the dephasing effect of exchange. The spin does not have sufficient time to change its state and accumulate phase error before being refocused. In this limit, $R_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\to 0$ and $R_{2,\\text{eff}} \\to R_{2,0}$.\n\nTherefore, a plot of $R_{2,\\text{eff}}$ versus $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ will show a characteristic dispersion curve: $R_{2,\\text{eff}}$ is high at low $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ and decreases to a plateau ($R_{2,0}$) at high $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$. The inflection point of this curve is related to the exchange rate, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, and the amplitude of the dispersion ($R_{2,\\text{eff}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}} \\to 0) - R_{2,0}$) is equal to $R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. Given $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx 500\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, an appropriate range for $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ would be from approximately $50-100\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ up to several thousand $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to properly map the curve.\n\nTo distinguish the three-site exchange in this problem from a simpler two-site process, one would fit the experimental dispersion data to the analytical equations for two-site and multisite exchange. The functional form of the dispersion curve is different for two-site versus multisite models. A three-site model would likely provide a significantly better fit to the data than a two-site model, as evidenced by a lower $\\chi^2$ value and the absence of systematic residuals. Furthermore, the amplitude of the dispersion is proportional to a function of the site populations and frequency offsets, which for a multisite process is related to the variance (or second moment) of the frequency distribution, not just the parameters of a single minor state.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. If conformers have offsets satisfying $|\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{j}|\\ll k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, their exchange produces no measurable effect on the line shape or baseline; relaxation dispersion cannot detect such dynamics because the exchange is fully averaged out at all modulation frequencies.**\n- **Incorrect**. This is fundamentally wrong. The fast exchange limit does not eliminate exchange effects; it averages the frequencies but introduces a new relaxation pathway ($R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$). Relaxation dispersion is the primary tool for detecting dynamics precisely in this regime.\n\n**B. Even when $|\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{j}|\\ll k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, stochastic modulation of the local Larmor frequency adds an exchange-induced contribution to transverse relaxation that scales with the variance of $\\Omega(t)$ and the correlation time, subtly broadening the absorptive profile and introducing small dispersive tails that distort the baseline. Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion, with refocusing frequencies spanning the range $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}\\sim 10^{2}$ to $10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to interrogate rates near $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, will reveal a characteristic decrease of $R_{2,\\text{eff}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}})$ that flattens at high $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$; deviations from a simple two-site fit and amplitude proportional to the second moment of $\\Omega_{i}$ indicate multisite exchange.**\n- **Correct**. This option accurately describes the physics of fast exchange broadening ($R_{\\mathrm{ex}}$), its dependence on the frequency variance, and its manifestation as line shape/baseline distortion. It correctly identifies CPMG RD as the appropriate detection method, specifies a suitable frequency range ($10^2$ to $10^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for $k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\approx 500\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), correctly predicts the shape of the dispersion curve (decreasing function of $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}$), and correctly explains how to distinguish multisite from two-site exchange (goodness-of-fit, amplitude dependence).\n\n**C. The observed baseline curvature must arise from receiver phase missetting or magnetic field drift; the correct way to detect multisite exchange is to record longitudinal relaxation $R_{1}$ as a function of temperature because $R_{1}$ is directly sensitive to chemical exchange at rates $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ll |\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{j}|$.**\n- **Incorrect**. This option dismisses the premise of the problem by attributing the effect to artifacts. Furthermore, it proposes an unsuitable method. $R_1$ relaxation is primarily sensitive to motions at the Larmor frequency ($\\sim 300\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$) and is much less sensitive to the low-frequency motions of chemical exchange ($k_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\sim 500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) than $R_2$ is. The condition it cites, $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ll |\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{j}|$, corresponds to slow exchange, which is contrary to the problem's setup.\n\n**D. Baseline distortions in single resolved lines necessarily indicate slow exchange with $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\ll |\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{j}|$; the optimal detection uses off-resonance irradiation to saturate minor conformers, which will eliminate the distortions but cannot quantify the exchange rates or distinguish multisite from two-site processes.**\n- **Incorrect**. The premise is wrong; such distortions are characteristic of fast or intermediate exchange, not slow exchange (which would show separate peaks). The proposed method, Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), is inapplicable here because the frequency separation ($10-20\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) is far too small for selective irradiation of the conformers.\n\n**E. Only when $|\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{j}|\\gg k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ do exchange processes affect the baseline; multisite exchange is best detected by measuring $R_{2}$ under spin-lock fields much larger than $|\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{j}|$, where $R_{2,\\text{eff}}$ grows linearly with the mean offset $\\langle\\Omega\\rangle$ and shows a single inflection point characteristic of two-site exchange.**\n- **Incorrect**. The initial condition is wrong; exchange affects lineshapes in all regimes. The proposed experiment is $R_{1\\rho}$ dispersion, but its description is flawed. The relaxation rate $R_{1\\rho}$ does not grow linearly with $\\langle\\Omega\\rangle$. The description of the dispersion curve is also oversimplified and misleading, especially in the context of identifying a multisite process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3697673"}]}
