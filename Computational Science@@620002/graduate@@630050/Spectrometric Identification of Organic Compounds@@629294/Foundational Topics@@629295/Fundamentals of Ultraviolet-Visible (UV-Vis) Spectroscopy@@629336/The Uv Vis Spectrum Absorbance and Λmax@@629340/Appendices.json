The conditions for the calculation are explicitly stated, ensuring a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, with no identifiable flaws. It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe core principle governing the relationship between absorbance, concentration, and path length in a homogeneous, non-scattering medium is the Beer-Lambert Law. This law represents the linear attenuation model mentioned in the problem. It is mathematically stated as:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\nwhere $A$ is the dimensionless absorbance, $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity (with units of $\\text{L mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$), $c$ is the molar concentration of the absorbing species (in $\\text{mol L}^{-1}$), and $l$ is the optical path length (in $\\text{cm}$).\n\nThe first part of the task is to determine the solute concentration, $c$, required to achieve a target absorbance. We can rearrange the Beer-Lambert Law to solve for $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$$\nThe problem provides the values for the quantities on the right side of the equation at the wavelength of maximum absorbance, $\\lambda_{\\max}$. Specifically, we are given $A = 0.800$, $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\max} = 2.50 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{L mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, and the nominal path length $l = 1.000\\,\\text{cm}$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$c = \\frac{0.800}{(2.50 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{L mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) \\times (1.000\\,\\text{cm})}$$\n$$c = \\frac{0.800}{2.50 \\times 10^{4}}\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$$\n$$c = 0.320 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1} = 3.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the concentration is:\n$$c = 3.200 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine the first-order fractional uncertainty in $c$, denoted as $\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|}$, that arises solely from the uncertainty in the path length, $\\delta l$. The problem states that $\\epsilon_{\\max}$ and $A$ are to be treated as exact quantities. Therefore, $c$ is a function of a single variable with uncertainty, $l$.\nThe relationship is $c(l) = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l} = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon} l^{-1}$.\n\nTo find the uncertainty $\\delta c$ resulting from the uncertainty $\\delta l$, we use the first-order approximation from differential calculus for error propagation:\n$$\\delta c \\approx \\left| \\frac{dc}{dl} \\right| \\delta l$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $c$ with respect to $l$:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dl} = \\frac{d}{dl}\\left(\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}\\right) = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon} \\frac{d}{dl}(l^{-1}) = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon}(-1 \\cdot l^{-2}) = -\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2}$$\nThe absolute value of the derivative is:\n$$\\left| \\frac{dc}{dl} \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2} \\right| = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2}$$\nThe fractional uncertainty in $c$ is defined as $\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|}$. Since $A$, $\\epsilon$, and $l$ are all positive quantities, $|c| = c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$. We can now write the expression for the fractional uncertainty:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|} \\approx \\frac{\\left| \\frac{dc}{dl} \\right| \\delta l}{|c|} = \\frac{\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2} \\delta l}{\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}}$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|} \\approx \\left(\\frac{A}{\\epsilon l^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon l}{A}\\right) \\delta l = \\frac{\\delta l}{l}$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a quantity inversely proportional to a variable, their first-order fractional uncertainties are equal.\n\nWe are given the uncertainty in the path length, $\\delta l = 0.004\\,\\text{cm}$, and the nominal path length, $l = 1.000\\,\\text{cm}$. Substituting these values:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|} \\approx \\frac{0.004\\,\\text{cm}}{1.000\\,\\text{cm}} = 0.004$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the unitless fractional uncertainty is:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{|c|} = 0.004000$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3.200 \\times 10^{-5} & 0.004000\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3727739"}, {"introduction": "While absorbance reveals the concentration of a chromophore, the wavelength of maximum absorption, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, provides invaluable clues about its electronic structure. This practice shifts our focus from quantitative analysis to structural elucidation by using established empirical rules to predict $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for a conjugated organic molecule.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of UV-Visible spectroscopy and the well-established empirical rules (commonly known as Woodward-Fieser rules or modifications thereof) used for predicting absorption maxima in conjugated organic molecules. It provides a specific, real compound ($4$-methyl-$3$-penten-$2$-one, or mesityl oxide), its structural features, a measured value for $\\lambda_{\\max}$, and a clear objective. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for its solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe prediction of $\\lambda_{\\max}$ for conjugated systems via empirical rules is based on the photophysical principle that structural modifications to a core chromophore systematically alter the energy difference ($\\Delta E$) between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). For the $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\ast}$ transition in an $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone, the chromophore's $\\pi$ system gives rise to the relevant molecular orbitals. Electron-donating groups like alkyl substituents, or extensions to the conjugated system, generally decrease the HOMO-LUMO gap. According to the Planck-Einstein relation, $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, a smaller energy gap corresponds to absorption of light with a longer wavelength (a bathochromic or \"red\" shift). The empirical rules quantify these shifts as additive increments to a base value for a parent chromophore.\n\nThe molecule in question is $4$-methyl-$3$-penten-$2$-one. Its structure is $\\text{CH}_3\\text{C(O)CH=C}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$. This is an acyclic $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone.

The problem confirms there are no alkyl or ring substituents. The increment for $\\alpha$-substituents is therefore $0$.\n-   At the $\\beta$-position $(\\mathrm{C}^{\\beta})$: There are two methyl groups attached. The problem states this explicitly. The standard increment for each alkyl substituent at the $\\beta$-position is $+12$ nm.\nTotal increment for $\\beta$-substituents = $2 \\times 12 \\text{ nm} = 24 \\text{ nm}$.\n\n$3$. **Other Structural Increments**:\n-   **Exocyclic Double Bond**: The problem specifies that there are no exocyclic double bonds. The increment is $0$.\n-   **Extended Conjugation**: The problem specifies there are no additional double bonds conjugated with the enone system. The increment is $0$.\n\n$4$. **Calculation of Predicted $\\lambda_{\\max}$**: The predicted value, $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{pred}}$, is the sum of the base value and all applicable increments.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{pred}} = \\lambda_{\\text{base}} + (\\text{Increment for } 2 \\times \\beta\\text{-substituents}) $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{pred}} = 215 \\text{ nm} + 24 \\text{ nm} = 239 \\text{ nm} $$\n\n$5$. **Calculation of Absolute Discrepancy**: The problem provides the experimentally measured value, $\\lambda_{\\max}^{\\text{meas}} = 236 \\text{ nm}$.

The use of UV-Vis spectroscopy, the Beer-Lambert law, isosbestic points, and the exciton model are standard and appropriate.

It is a well-formulated question based on sound scientific principles and data.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem can be solved by analyzing the spectral data chronologically with increasing concentration.\n\n1.  **Establish Monomer Behavior:** At low concentrations, the dye is expected to exist as a non-interacting monomer. The problem states that at low $c$, the dye has a single absorption band at $\\lambda_{\\max}=540\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Let's verify that the Beer-Lambert law, $A=\\varepsilon lc$, holds for the first two data points, which would confirm this region corresponds to the monomer species. The path length is given as $l=1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    - For $c_1=0.50\\,\\mu\\text{M} = 0.50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}$, the absorbance is $A_1=0.060$. The molar absorptivity $\\varepsilon$ is $\\varepsilon = A_1 / (l c_1) = 0.060 / (1.0\\,\\text{cm} \\times 0.50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = 1.2 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n    - For $c_2=1.0\\,\\mu\\text{M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}$, the absorbance is $A_2=0.120$. The molar absorptivity is $\\varepsilon = A_2 / (l c_2) = 0.120 / (1.0\\,\\text{cm} \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = 1.2 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n    Since the calculated $\\varepsilon$ is constant, the Beer-Lambert law is obeyed up to $c=1.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$. This confirms that the species absorbing at $\\lambda_{\\max}=540\\,\\text{nm}$ is the monomer.\n\n2.  **Identify the Onset of Aggregation:** Aggregation begins at the concentration where the system first deviates from ideal monomer behavior.\n    - At $c=2.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, the expected absorbance for the monomer at $540\\,\\text{nm}$ would be $A_{\\text{expected}} = \\varepsilon l c = (1.2 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{cm}^{-1})(1.0\\,\\text{cm})(2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{M}) = 0.240$.\n    - The problem states that at this concentration, \"the $540\\,\\text{nm}$ band is slightly reduced relative to linear extrapolation\". This is the first reported deviation from the Beer-Lambert Law for the monomer.\n    - Concurrently, \"a shoulder emerges near $585\\,\\text{nm}$\". This indicates the formation of a new chemical species that absorbs at this longer wavelength.\n    - Therefore, the onset of aggregation is observed at $c=2.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\n3.  **Characterize the First Aggregate:** We must identify the nature of the new species absorbing at $585\\,\\text{nm}$.\n    - The monomer absorption maximum is at $\\lambda_{\\max}=540\\,\\text{nm}$.\n    - The new absorption appears at approximately $\\lambda=585\\,\\text{nm}$.\n    - This constitutes a shift to a longer wavelength, which is a **red shift** (or bathochromic shift).\n    - According to the exciton coupling model provided: J-aggregation (head-to-tail) results in a red-shifted band, while H-aggregation (cofacial) results in a blue-shifted band.\n    - The observed red shift is the defining characteristic of a **J-aggregate**.\n    - Further evidence supports this conclusion:\n        - At $c=5.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, the band at $\\lambda_{\\max}=585\\,\\text{nm}$ becomes \"sharp\". The model states J-aggregates typically have \"narrower\" (i.e., sharper) bands than the monomer.\n        - An **isosbestic point** is observed at $560\\,\\text{nm}$ for concentrations from $c=1.0$ to $10.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$. An isosbestic point is a wavelength at which the molar absorptivities of two interconverting species are equal. Its presence is strong evidence for a clean equilibrium between two species, in this case, the monomer and the J-aggregate.\n\n4.  **Analyze Higher Concentration Events:** At $c=50.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, a \"new broad band appears centered near $510\\,\\text{nm}$\". This is a **blue shift** relative to the monomer's $\\lambda_{\\max}=540\\,\\text{nm}$. This behavior, including the broadness of the band, is characteristic of **H-aggregation**. This confirms that H-aggregation also occurs, but at much higher concentrations than the initial J-aggregation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The earliest evidence of aggregation is at $c=2.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, and the first aggregate to form is a J-aggregate, as evidenced by the red-shifted absorption band at $585\\,\\text{nm}$ and the presence of an isosbestic point.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Aggregation begins near $c\\approx 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and the first aggregate is a J-aggregate; the emergent red-shifted, sharpened band and isosbestic behavior indicate head-to-tail exciton coupling and a two-state interconversion with the monomer.**\n- **Onset Concentration:** Correct.

The justification correctly links the observed spectral features (red shift, sharpening, isosbestic point) to their physical origins (head-to-tail exciton coupling causing J-aggregation) and the chemical process (a two-state monomer-aggregate equilibrium).\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.

Clear evidence of aggregation exists at much lower concentrations ($c=2.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ and $c=5.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$).\n- **Justification:** Incorrect. The appearance of a new, well-defined band and an isosbestic point is classic evidence of a chemical equilibrium, not instrumental artifact. Instrumental nonlinearity typically manifests as a curvature in the Beer's law plot without generating new spectral features.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Aggregation begins near $c\\approx 50.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and the first aggregate is an H-aggregate; the red shift at lower $c$ is solvatochromism rather than aggregation since the solvent is unchanged.**\n- **Onset Concentration:** Incorrect. This marks the onset of a *second* aggregation event, not the first.\n- **Justification:** Incorrect. Attributing the concentration-dependent red shift to solvatochromism is not viable. Solvatochromism refers to solvent-induced spectral shifts. The problem explicitly states the experiment is run in a \"single solvent\" at \"constant temperature\". The behavior, especially the isosbestic point, points unequivocally to a concentration-driven equilibrium between two distinct species (monomer and aggregate), not a gradual change in the solvent environment.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3727747"}]}
