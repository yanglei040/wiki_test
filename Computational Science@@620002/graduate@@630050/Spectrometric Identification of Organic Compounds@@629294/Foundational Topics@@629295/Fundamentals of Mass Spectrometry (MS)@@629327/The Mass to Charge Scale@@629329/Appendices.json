First, the mass scale drift rate is derived from fundamental principles. Second, an optimal lock-mass update interval is determined by minimizing the combined error from measurement noise and uncompensated drift.\n\n**Part 1: Mass Scale Drift Rate**\n\nThe motion of an ion in a Time-of-Flight (ToF) mass spectrometer is governed by two fundamental relations. An ion of mass $m$ and charge $ze$, where $z$ is the charge state and $e$ is the elementary charge, is accelerated through a potential difference $V$. It acquires a kinetic energy given by:\n$$z e V = \\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$$\nwhere $v$ is the final velocity of the ion. The ion then travels through a field-free drift region of length $L$. The time-of-flight, which we denote as $t_{\\mathrm{tof}}$ to distinguish it from the temporal variable $t$, is:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{tof}} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nWe can combine these two equations to relate the mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ to the measured time-of-flight. From the first equation, we solve for velocity: $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 z e V}{m}}$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{tof}} = L \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2 z e V}}$$\nRearranging this equation yields the fundamental relationship for ToF mass spectrometry:\n$$\\frac{m}{z} = \\left(\\frac{2e}{L^2}\\right) V t_{\\mathrm{tof}}^2$$\nThe instrument is calibrated at an initial voltage $V_{0}$. This means the spectrometer's software calculates the \"inferred\" mass-to-charge ratio, denoted $(\\frac{m}{z})_{\\mathrm{inf}}$, using the constant $V_{0}$, regardless of the actual voltage. For a measured flight time $t_{\\mathrm{tof}}$, the instrument reports:\n$$\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{\\mathrm{inf}} = \\left(\\frac{2e}{L^2}\\right) V_{0} t_{\\mathrm{tof}}^2$$\nHowever, the actual voltage $V$ drifts with temperature, described by $V(T) = V_{0}\\left(1 + \\beta \\left(T - T_{0}\\right)\\right)$. The temperature itself drifts with time $t$ (in hours) as $T(t) = T_{0} + \\gamma t$. Therefore, the true voltage as a function of time is $V(t) = V_{0}(1 + \\beta \\gamma t)$.

The standard error of the mean of these $N$ independent measurements is:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{r \\Delta t}}$$\n\n2.  **Uncompensated drift error ($\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{drift}}$):** A lock-mass correction is applied and held constant for the duration $\\Delta t$. During this interval, the mass scale continues to drift. The drift accumulates linearly with time (for small drifts). The rate of drift in ppm/s is $R_d$. The maximum error due to uncompensated drift occurs at the end of the interval, $t = \\Delta t$, and is given by:\n    $$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{drift}} = R_d \\Delta t$$\n    where $R_d = \\frac{10^6|\\beta\\gamma|}{3600}$. Let's define a constant $D = \\frac{|\\beta\\gamma|}{3600}$ which is the drift rate in fractional units per second. Then $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{drift}} = D \\times 10^6 \\times \\Delta t$. To maintain unit consistency with $\\sigma_1$ given in ppm, we will work with ppm units. Let the drift rate in ppm/s be denoted $D_{\\mathrm{ppm}} = R_d$. Then $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{drift}} = D_{\\mathrm{ppm}} \\Delta t$.\n\n3.  **Total Error and Optimization:** The total error variance is the sum of the component variances:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}^2(\\Delta t) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{avg}}^2 + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{drift}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{r \\Delta t}}\\right)^2 + (D_{\\mathrm{ppm}} \\Delta t)^2$$\n    $$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}^2(\\Delta t) = \\frac{\\sigma_{1}^2}{r (\\Delta t)} + D_{\\mathrm{ppm}}^2 (\\Delta t)^2$$\n    To find the update interval $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ that minimizes this total error, we differentiate $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}^2$ with respect to $\\Delta t$ and set the result to zero.\n    $$\\frac{d}{d(\\Delta t)} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}^2(\\Delta t) = -\\frac{\\sigma_{1}^2}{r (\\Delta t)^2} + 2 D_{\\mathrm{ppm}}^2 \\Delta t$$\n    Setting the derivative to zero at $\\Delta t = \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}}$:\n    $$2 D_{\\mathrm{ppm}}^2 \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{1}^2}{r (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}})^2}$$\n    $$(\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}})^3 = \\frac{\\sigma_{1}^2}{2 r D_{\\mathrm{ppm}}^2}$$\n    This yields the analytic expression for the optimal update interval:\n    $$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{1}^2}{2 r D_{\\mathrm{ppm}}^2}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:** We are given the parameters:\n    $\\beta = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{^{\\circ}C^{-1}}$\n    $\\gamma = 0.6\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{h}$\n    $\\sigma_{1} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$\n    $r = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n    First, we calculate the drift rate $D_{\\mathrm{ppm}}$ in ppm/s:\n    $$D_{\\mathrm{ppm}} = \\frac{10^6 \\times |\\beta \\gamma|}{3600} = \\frac{10^6 \\times |(2.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 0.6|}{3600} = \\frac{10^6 \\times 1.2 \\times 10^{-5}}{3600} = \\frac{12}{3600} = \\frac{1}{300} \\, \\mathrm{ppm/s}$$\n    Now, substitute the values into the expression for $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}}$:\n    $$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\left(\\frac{(1.8)^2}{2 \\times 1.0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\right)^2}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n    $$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\left(\\frac{3.24}{2 \\times \\frac{1}{90000}}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{3.24 \\times 90000}{2}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n    $$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}} = (1.62 \\times 90000)^{1/3} = (145800)^{1/3}$$\n    $$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\approx 52.6253\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n    Rounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n    $$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\approx 52.6\\,\\mathrm{s}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{52.6}$$", "id": "3727365"}]}
