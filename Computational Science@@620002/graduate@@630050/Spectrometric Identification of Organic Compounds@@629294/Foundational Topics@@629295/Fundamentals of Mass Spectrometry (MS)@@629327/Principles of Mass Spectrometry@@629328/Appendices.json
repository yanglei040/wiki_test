Analysis of the Exact Mass Difference**\n\nHigh-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) measures mass-to-charge ratios with high precision, allowing for the differentiation of isobaric species (ions with the same nominal mass but different exact masses). Since $z=1$, the measured $m/z$ differences correspond directly to mass differences.\n\n- **Observed Mass Difference:** The $M+2$ peak is observed at a mass $1.99580$ Da greater than the monoisotopic peak.\n    $$ \\Delta m_{\\text{obs}} = 1.99580 \\text{ Da} $$\n\n- **Theoretical Mass Difference for $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ Substitution:** This corresponds to replacing one $^{32}\\mathrm{S}$ atom with one $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ atom.\n    $$ \\Delta m(^{34}\\mathrm{S}) = m(^{34}\\mathrm{S}) - m(^{32}\\mathrm{S}) = 33.967867004 \\text{ Da} - 31.972071174 \\text{ Da} = 1.99579583 \\text{ Da} $$\n    Rounding to five decimal places for comparison, $\\Delta m(^{34}\\mathrm{S}) \\approx 1.99580 \\text{ Da}$.\n\n- **Theoretical Mass Difference for Two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Substitutions:** This corresponds to replacing two $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms with two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms.\n    $$ \\Delta m(2 \\times {^{13}\\mathrm{C}}) = 2 \\times [m(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) - m(^{12}\\mathrm{C})] = 2 \\times [13.003354835 \\text{ Da} - 12.000000000 \\text{ Da}] $$\n    $$ \\Delta m(2 \\times {^{13}\\mathrm{C}}) = 2 \\times 1.003354835 \\text{ Da} = 2.00670967 \\text{ Da} $$\n    Rounding to five decimal places, $\\Delta m(2 \\times {^{13}\\mathrm{C}}) \\approx 2.00671 \\text{ Da}$.\n\n- **Comparison:** The observed mass difference, $\\Delta m_{\\text{obs}} = 1.99580$ Da, is in excellent agreement with the theoretical mass difference for a $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ substitution ($\\approx 1.99580$ Da) and significantly different from that for a two-$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ substitution ($\\approx 2.00671$ Da). The mass difference alone provides strong evidence that the peak is due to $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Relative Intensity**\n\nThe relative intensities of isotopic peaks are governed by the natural abundances of the isotopes and combinatorial statistics.\n\n- **Intensity of the $M+1$ Peak and Carbon Count:** The $M+1$ peak intensity is primarily due to the presence of one $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atom in the molecule (contribution from $^{33}\\mathrm{S}$ is smaller and neglected here per problem statement). A well-established approximation relates the relative intensity of the $M+1$ peak to the number of carbon atoms ($N_{\\mathrm{C}}$):\n    $$ \\frac{I_{M+1}}{I_M} \\approx N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\times \\text{Abundance}(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) $$\n    Given $I_{M+1} = 11.0\\% = 0.110$ and the abundance of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ as $1.107\\% = 0.01107$:\n    $$ N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx \\frac{0.110}{0.01107} \\approx 9.936 $$\n    Since $N_{\\mathrm{C}}$ must be an integer, we can confidently estimate that there are $N_{\\mathrm{C}} = 10$ carbon atoms in the molecule.\n\n- **Predicted Intensity for $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ Contribution:** The monoisotopic peak contains $^{32}\\mathrm{S}$. The $M+2$ peak from sulfur would contain $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$. For a compound containing a single sulfur atom, the ratio of the $M+2$ peak (due to $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$) to the monoisotopic peak (due to $^{32}\\mathrm{S}$) is the ratio of their natural abundances.\n    $$ \\frac{I_{M+2}(^{34}\\mathrm{S})}{I_M} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Abundance}(^{34}\\mathrm{S})}{\\text{Abundance}(^{32}\\mathrm{S})} = \\frac{4.21\\%}{94.99\\%} \\approx 0.04432 $$\n    So, the predicted intensity is $I_{M+2}(^{34}\\mathrm{S}) \\approx 4.43\\%$.\n\n- **Predicted Intensity for Two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Contribution:** The intensity of the $M+2$ peak due to the presence of two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms can be estimated using the number of carbon atoms, $N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 10$. The probability of incorporating two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ isotopes is given by a term from the binomial expansion. A common approximation is:\n    $$ \\frac{I_{M+2}(2 \\times {^{13}\\mathrm{C}})}{I_M} \\approx \\frac{(N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\times \\text{Abundance}(^{13}\\mathrm{C}))^2}{2} $$\n    Since $N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\times \\text{Abundance}(^{13}\\mathrm{C})$ is the fractional intensity of the $M+1$ peak due to carbon, we have:\n    $$ \\frac{I_{M+2}(2 \\times {^{13}\\mathrm{C}})}{I_M} \\approx \\frac{(0.110)^2}{2} = \\frac{0.0121}{2} = 0.00605 $$\n    So, the predicted intensity is $I_{M+2}(2 \\times {^{13}\\mathrm{C}}) \\approx 0.605\\%$.\n\n- **Comparison:** The observed $M+2$ intensity is $I_{M+2} = 3.8\\%$. This value is much closer to the predicted intensity for a single $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ atom ($\\approx 4.43\\%$) than to the predicted intensity for two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms ($\\approx 0.61\\%$). The sum of the predicted contributions, $4.43\\% + 0.61\\% = 5.04\\%$, is higher than the observed $3.8\\%$. This discrepancy is common; the abundance ratio $4.21/94.99$ assumes the molecule *has* sulfur. Experimental values can vary. However, the key point is the dominant contributor. The $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ contribution is predicted to be over $7$ times larger than the $2 \\times {^{13}\\mathrm{C}}$ contribution.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth the exact mass and relative intensity analyses independently and concordantly indicate that the observed $M+2$ peak at $m_0 + 1.99580$ is dominated by the isotopic contribution of a single $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ atom. A robust strategy must leverage both of these quantitative pillars.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

If $\\Delta m_{M+2}\\approx 1.9958$ and $N_{\\mathrm{C}}\\approx 10$ gives $I_{M+2}^{(2\\times^{13}\\mathrm{C})}\\ll 3.8\\%$ while $I_{M+2}^{(^{34}\\mathrm{S})}\\approx 4.4\\%$, conclude $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ dominates.**\n\nThis option outlines the exact comprehensive strategy derived above. It correctly identifies the comparison of exact mass differences. It correctly describes the process for estimating the carbon count from $I_{M+1}$ and using it to predict the two-$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ contribution to $I_{M+2}$. It presents the correct numerical comparisons: the observed mass difference matches the $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ substitution, the calculated intensity for two-$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ is much smaller than the observed intensity, and the calculated intensity for $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ is close to the observed intensity. The conclusion that $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ dominates is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Rely on nominal mass and intensity only: because both $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ and two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ add approximately $+2$ in nominal mass, discriminate by intensity alone; if $I_{M+2}\\approx 4\\%$, assign $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ regardless of $I_{M+1}$.**\n\nThis approach is flawed. It explicitly ignores the high-precision mass data, which is the hallmark of HRMS and provides the most definitive evidence in this case. Discriminating based on a rule of thumb for intensity ($I_{M+2} \\approx 4\\%$ for sulfur) without a comparative calculation is not a rigorous, first-principles method. Stating to proceed \"regardless of $I_{M+1}$\" is incorrect because $I_{M+1}$ is required to quantify the competing contribution from two-$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atoms.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use mass difference only: if $\\Delta m_{M+2}$ is closer to $2.0067$ than to $1.9958$, assign two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$; otherwise assign $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$. For the data here, conclude two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$.**\n\nThe logical framework for using the mass difference is sound. However, the option draws a conclusion that is flagrantly contradicted by the data. The observed mass difference is $\\Delta m_{M+2} = 1.99580$. This value is essentially identical to the theoretical value for a $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ substitution ($1.9958$) and very different from the value for a two-$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ substitution ($2.0067$).

Use a proportionality between $M+1$ and $M+2$: approximate $I_{M+2}^{(2\\times^{13}\\mathrm{C})}\\approx \\left(I_{M+1}^{(^{13}\\mathrm{C})}\\right)^2$; if the observed $I_{M+2}$ is comparable to $\\left(11.0\\%\\right)^2$, assign two $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$; otherwise assign $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$.**\n\nThis option is flawed for two primary reasons. First, it uses an incorrect formula for the intensity of the two-$^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ peak. The correct approximation includes a combinatorial factor of $1/2! = 1/2$, i.e., $I_{M+2} \\approx (I_{M+1})^2 / 2$. The proposed formula overestimates the intensity by a factor of $2$. Second, like option B, it completely ignores the highly precise mass difference data, which is a critical piece of evidence. A sound strategy would not discard such definitive information.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3718902"}, {"introduction": "This hands-on practice serves as a capstone exercise in the structural elucidation process, demonstrating how a single, highly accurate mass measurement can lead to a unique molecular formula.

The provided data and principles are standard in the field of analytical chemistry. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be pursued.\n\nThe process involves three main steps:\n1. Calculation of the mass range for the neutral molecule.\n2. Application of structural and chemical rules to constrain the search space.\n3. A systematic enumeration and verification of candidate formulas.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Neutral Monoisotopic Mass Window**\n\nThe observed mass-to-charge ratio for the singly protonated ion, $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}$, is given as $m/z = 180.0655$. The instrument's mass accuracy is $\\pm 2$ parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe absolute mass error, $\\Delta m$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\Delta m = (m/z) \\times (\\text{accuracy in ppm}) \\times 10^{-6} $$\n$$ \\Delta m = 180.0655 \\times 2 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.000360131 \\text{ Da} $$\n\nThis means the true $m/z$ of the ion is within the range:\n$$ [ (m/z) - \\Delta m, (m/z) + \\Delta m ] = [180.0655 - 0.000360131, 180.0655 + 0.000360131] $$\n$$ m/z_{\\text{range}} = [180.06513987, 180.06586013] $$\n\nThe observed ion is $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^{+}$, where $M$ is the neutral molecule. The mass of the ion is the sum of the neutral molecule's mass, $M_{\\text{neutral}}$, and the mass of a proton, $m_p$. The problem states the relationship for a singly protonated ion as $M_{\\text{neutral}} = (m/z) - m_p$. The provided proton mass is $m_p = 1.00727646688$ Da.\n\nThe central value for the neutral mass is:\n$$ M_{\\text{center}} = 180.0655 - 1.00727646688 = 179.05822353312 \\text{ Da} $$\n\nThe mass window for the neutral molecule is obtained by subtracting $m_p$ from the ion's $m/z$ range. The width of the window remains $2 \\times \\Delta m$.\n$$ M_{\\text{min}} = M_{\\text{center}} - \\Delta m = 179.05822353312 - 0.000360131 = 179.05786340212 \\text{ Da} $$\n$$ M_{\\text{max}} = M_{\\text{center}} + \\Delta m = 179.05822353312 + 0.000360131 = 179.05858366412 \\text{ Da} $$\nAny valid molecular formula must have a calculated monoisotopic mass that falls within the range $[179.05786, 179.05859]$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Chemical and Structural Constraints**\n\nA candidate formula $C_c H_h N_n O_o$, where $c, h, n, o$ are non-negative integers, must satisfy several rules.\n\n- **Elemental Composition**: The formula can only contain Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). The monoisotopic masses are given as:\n  $m_C = 12.000000000$ Da\n  $m_H = 1.00782503223$ Da\n  $m_N = 14.00307400443$ Da\n  $m_O = 15.99491461957$ Da\n\n- **Nitrogen Rule**: The nominal mass of the neutral molecule is the integer part of its exact mass, which is $\\lfloor 179.058... \\rfloor = 179$. Since the nominal mass is odd, the number of nitrogen atoms, $n$, must be an odd integer ($n \\in \\{1, 3, 5, ...\\}$).\n\n- **Double Bond Equivalents (DBE)**: For a stable, neutral molecule, the DBE must be a non-negative integer.\n  $$ \\mathrm{DBE} = c - \\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\ge 0 $$\n  For DBE to be an integer, the term $-\\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}$ must be an integer or half-integer such that the sum is an integer. Specifically, $h$ and $n$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd). Since the nitrogen rule dictates that $n$ must be odd, it follows that the number of hydrogen atoms, $h$, must also be odd.\n\n**Step 3: Systematic Enumeration and Verification**\n\nWe search for integer solutions $(c,h,n,o)$ that satisfy all constraints. The exact mass of a formula $C_c H_h N_n O_o$ is:\n$$ M_{\\text{calc}} = c \\cdot m_C + h \\cdot m_H + n \\cdot m_N + o \\cdot m_O $$\nWe require $M_{\\text{min}} \\le M_{\\text{calc}} \\le M_{\\text{max}}$. This can be rewritten for $h$:\n$$ \\frac{M_{\\text{min}} - (c \\cdot m_C + n \\cdot m_N + o \\cdot m_O)}{m_H} \\le h \\le \\frac{M_{\\text{max}} - (c \\cdot m_C + n \\cdot m_N + o \\cdot m_O)}{m_H} $$\nThe width of this allowed interval for $h$ for any given $(c,n,o)$ is very narrow:\n$$ \\Delta h = \\frac{M_{\\text{max}} - M_{\\text{min}}}{m_H} = \\frac{0.000720262}{1.00782503223} \\approx 0.00071465 $$\nSince $h$ must be an integer, a solution exists for a given $(c, n, o)$ triplet only if this narrow interval contains an odd integer. We systematically iterate through plausible values for $n, o, c$.\n\nLet's test $n=1, 3, 5, ...$\nFor a given $(c,n,o)$, let $K = c \\cdot m_C + n \\cdot m_N + o \\cdot m_O$. The allowed range for $h$ is $[(M_{\\text{min}}-K)/m_H, (M_{\\text{max}}-K)/m_H]$.\n\n**Case n = 1**:\nWe test combinations of $c$ and $o$. Let's test the combination $(c,o) = (9,3)$.\n$K = 9 \\cdot m_C + 1 \\cdot m_N + 3 \\cdot m_O$\n$K = 9(12.000000000) + 1(14.00307400443) + 3(15.99491461957)$\n$K = 108 + 14.00307400443 + 47.98474385871 = 169.98781786314$\nThe required range for $h$ is:\n$h_{\\text{min}} = (179.05786340212 - 169.98781786314) / 1.00782503223 = 8.999696...$\n$h_{\\text{max}} = (179.05858366412 - 169.98781786314) / 1.00782503223 = 9.000411...$\nThe interval $[8.999696, 9.000411]$ contains exactly one integer, which is $9$. As $9$ is odd, this is a valid candidate for $h$.\nSo, we have the formula $C_9H_9NO_3$.\nLet's verify its mass and DBE:\n$M_{\\text{calc}} = 169.98781786314 + 9 \\cdot m_H = 169.98781786314 + 9(1.00782503223) = 179.05824315321$ Da.\nThis mass is within the target window $[179.05786, 179.05859]$.\nNow, check the DBE:\n$\\mathrm{DBE} = c - \\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} + 1 = 9 - \\frac{9}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + 1 = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 6$.\nThe DBE is a non-negative integer. Thus, $C_9H_9NO_3$ is a valid formula.\n\nSystematic exploration of other combinations for $n=1$ and for higher odd values of $n$ (e.g., $n=3,5,7,...$) reveals no other combinations for $(c,h,n,o)$ that result in a calculated mass within the narrow window. For example, let's test $C_8H_9N_3O_2$:\n$n=3, h=9, c=8, o=2$.\n$M_{\\text{calc}} = 8(12) + 9(1.007825) + 3(14.003074) + 2(15.994915) \\approx 179.06948$ Da. This is outside the allowed mass range.\nLet's test $C_5H_5N_7O$:\n$n=7, h=5, c=5, o=1$.\n$M_{\\text{calc}} = 5(12) + 5(1.007825) + 7(14.003074) + 1(15.994915) \\approx 179.05556$ Da. This is also outside the allowed mass range.\n\nDue to the very narrow mass tolerance ($\\approx 0.0007$ Da) and the discrete nature of atomic composition, it is rare for multiple distinct formulas to fall within such a tight window for small molecules. A thorough search confirms that $C_9H_9NO_3$ is the only formula that satisfies all the given constraints.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct formulas that satisfy all constraints is 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3719052"}]}
