A reasoned solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires a deduction of the nitrogen rule from fundamental principles, rather than its direct application. We will proceed in the three steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nLet the elemental formula for the neutral peptide, $\\mathrm{M}$, be $\\mathrm{C}_c \\mathrm{H}_h \\mathrm{N}_n \\mathrm{O}_o \\mathrm{S}_s$, where $c, h, n, o, s$ are non-negative integers representing the counts of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, respectively. The problem uses $\\mathrm{M}$ to denote the nominal mass of the neutral molecule and $N$ for the nitrogen count, so we will equate $N=n$.\n\n**1. Relationship between the parity of the neutral nominal mass ($\\mathrm{M}$) and the hydrogen count ($h$).**\n\nThe nominal mass of a molecule is the sum of the nominal masses of its constituent atoms. The nominal mass of an element is the integer mass of its most abundant, stable isotope. The widely accepted nominal masses for the elements in question are:\n- Carbon ($^{12}\\mathrm{C}$): $12$\n- Hydrogen ($^{1}\\mathrm{H}$): $1$\n- Nitrogen ($^{14}\\mathrm{N}$): $14$\n- Oxygen ($^{16}\\text{O}$): $16$\n- Sulfur ($^{32}\\text{S}$): $32$\n\nThe nominal mass of the neutral molecule, $\\mathrm{M}$, is given by the expression:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} = 12c + 1h + 14n + 16o + 32s $$\nTo find the relationship between the parities, we analyze this equation using modulo $2$ arithmetic.\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = (12c + 1h + 14n + 16o + 32s) \\bmod 2 $$\nWe evaluate the parity of each term. An even number is congruent to $0 \\pmod 2$, and an odd number is congruent to $1 \\pmod 2$.\n- $12c \\bmod 2 = 0$, since $12$ is even.\n- $1h \\bmod 2 = h \\bmod 2$, since $1$ is odd.\n- $14n \\bmod 2 = 0$, since $14$ is even.\n- $16o \\bmod 2 = 0$, since $16$ is even.\n- $32s \\bmod 2 = 0$, since $32$ is even.\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = (0 + h + 0 + 0 + 0) \\bmod 2 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = h \\bmod 2 $$\nThis relationship shows that the parity of the nominal mass of the neutral molecule is determined solely by the parity of its number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Relationship between the parity of the hydrogen count ($h$) and the nitrogen count ($n$).**\n\nThis relationship arises from the principle of valence conservation in stable, neutral, covalent molecules. The total number of valence \"slots\" across all atoms must be an even number, as each covalent bond satisfies two such slots. Therefore, the sum of the valences of all atoms in the molecule must be an even integer.\n\nThe standard valences for these elements in stable organic molecules like peptides are:\n- Carbon: $4$\n- Hydrogen: $1$\n- Nitrogen: $3$\n- Oxygen: $2$\n- Sulfur: $2$ (e.g., in cysteine or methionine)\n\nThe sum of valences, $\\sum V$, for the molecule $\\mathrm{C}_c \\mathrm{H}_h \\mathrm{N}_n \\mathrm{O}_o \\mathrm{S}_s$ is:\n$$ \\sum V = 4c + 1h + 3n + 2o + 2s $$\nAs established, this sum must be even:\n$$ \\left( \\sum V \\right) \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\n$$ (4c + 1h + 3n + 2o + 2s) \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\nAnalyzing each term modulo $2$:\n- $4c \\bmod 2 = 0$.\n- $1h \\bmod 2 = h \\bmod 2$.\n- $3n \\bmod 2 = n \\bmod 2$, since $3$ is odd.\n- $2o \\bmod 2 = 0$.\n- $2s \\bmod 2 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the valence sum equation gives:\n$$ (0 + h + n + 0 + 0) \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\n$$ (h + n) \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\nThis equation implies that the sum of the hydrogen count and the nitrogen count must be an even number. This can only be true if $h$ and $n$ have the same parity (both even or both odd). Therefore:\n$$ h \\bmod 2 = n \\bmod 2 $$\nThis establishes that the parity of the hydrogen count is identical to the parity of the nitrogen count.\n\n**3. Application to the observed ion and final calculation.**\n\nWe are given the nominal $m/z$ of the singly protonated ion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+}$ is $1568$. Since the charge $z$ is $1$, a low-resolution instrument measures the nominal mass of the ion, $\\mathrm{M_{ion}}$, to be $1568$.\n$$ \\mathrm{M_{ion}} = 1568 $$\nThe parity of the ion's mass is:\n$$ \\mathrm{M_{ion}} \\bmod 2 = 1568 \\bmod 2 = 0 $$\nThe ion's mass is even.\n\nThe ion $\\left[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}\\right]^{+}$ is formed by adding a proton ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) to the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{M}$. In terms of mass, this corresponds to adding one hydrogen atom (nominal mass $1$) to the neutral molecule.\n$$ \\mathrm{M_{ion}} = \\mathrm{M} + 1 $$\nTaking this equation modulo $2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{M_{ion}} \\bmod 2 = (\\mathrm{M} + 1) \\bmod 2 $$\nWe can now substitute the known parity of the ion's mass:\n$$ 0 = (\\mathrm{M} + 1) \\bmod 2 $$\nThis equation is satisfied only if $\\mathrm{M}+1$ is an even number, which requires that $\\mathrm{M}$ must be an odd number. Thus, we find the parity of the neutral molecule's nominal mass:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = 1 $$\n\nNow we combine the relationships derived in the first two parts:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = h \\bmod 2 $$\n$$ h \\bmod 2 = n \\bmod 2 $$\nChaining these together, we get the relationship between the neutral mass parity and the nitrogen count parity:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = n \\bmod 2 $$\nAs per the problem's notation, $N=n$, so:\n$$ \\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = N \\bmod 2 $$\nSince we found that $\\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = 1$, it directly follows that:\n$$ N \\bmod 2 = 1 $$\nThis means the number of nitrogen atoms in the peptide is odd.\n\nThe final answer is a two-entry row matrix giving the parity of the neutral nominal mass and the parity of the nitrogen count.\n- $\\mathrm{M} \\bmod 2 = 1$\n- $N \\bmod 2 = 1$\n\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3727480"}, {"introduction": "In modern analytical chemistry, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can pinpoint an ion's mass with incredible precision, yet this often yields multiple possible elemental compositions.

This implies that the number of hydrogen atoms ($b$) and nitrogen atoms ($c$) must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n-   For a stable, neutral molecule, the DBE must be non-negative: $DBE \\geq 0$.\n\n**3. Systematic Search for Candidate Formulas**\n\nWe must search through all possible integer quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ within the specified ranges:\n$3 \\leq a \\leq 7$, $4 \\leq b \\leq 12$, $0 \\leq c \\leq 3$, $0 \\leq d \\leq 3$.\n\nWe will systematically test combinations of $(a,b,c,d)$ against the DBE and mass window constraints. A structured search is performed by iterating through the atom counts, starting with the heaviest elements which have the largest impact on the total mass.\n\nLet's test combinations of $a$ (Carbon) and $d$ (Oxygen) to find the remaining mass to be accounted for by $b$ (Hydrogen) and $c$ (Nitrogen).\nLet $M_{rem}(b,c) = M(a,b,c,d) - a \\cdot M_C - d \\cdot M_O$. The target range for $M_{rem}$ is $m_{window} - (12a + 15.994914620d)$.\n\nAfter a thorough search across all combinations, we find very few possibilities. Let's analyze a promising case identified by this search: $(a,d)=(5,2)$.\nFor $a=5$ and $d=2$, the mass contribution is $M_{C,O} = 5(12) + 2(15.994914620) = 60 + 31.98982924 = 91.98982924$ u.\nThe remaining mass to be contributed by H and N must be:\n$M_{rem,min} = 113.047341 - 91.989829 = 21.057512$ u\n$M_{rem,max} = 113.048019 - 91.989829 = 21.058190$ u\nSo, we need to find $(b,c)$ such that $21.057512 \\leq b(1.007825032) + c(14.003074005) \\leq 21.058190$.\n\nLet's test allowed values for $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n- If $c=0$: $b(1.007825032) \\approx 21.058$. This gives $b \\approx 20.89$, which is outside the range $4 \\leq b \\leq 12$.\n- If $c=1$: We need $b(1.007825032) \\approx 21.058 - 14.003074005 = 7.054926$. This gives $b \\approx 7.054926 / 1.007825 \\approx 7.0000$.

This is impossible for $b>0$.\n\nA continued exhaustive search confirms that $\\mathrm{C_5H_7NO_2}$ is the sole formula satisfying the atom range, DBE, and mass constraints.\nThe set of candidate formulas before applying the nitrogen rule is $S_1 = \\{ \\mathrm{C_5H_7NO_2} \\}$.\n\n**4. Application of the Nitrogen Rule**\n\nThe problem states that the observed nominal mass is $113$, which is an odd number. The nitrogen rule states that an organic molecule containing an odd number of nitrogen atoms will have an odd nominal molecular mass. Conversely, a molecule with an even number of (or zero) nitrogen atoms will have an even nominal molecular mass. This rule applies to singly charged molecular ions as well.\n\nGiven the odd nominal mass ($113$), any candidate formula must have an odd number of nitrogen atoms. The number of nitrogen atoms is denoted by $c$. Therefore, $c$ must be odd. In the allowed range $0 \\leq c \\leq 3$, this means $c$ must be $1$ or $3$.\n\nWe now prune the candidate set $S_1$ using this rule.\nOur only candidate is $\\mathrm{C_5H_7NO_2}$, which has the quadruple $(a,b,c,d) = (5,7,1,2)$.\nThe number of nitrogen atoms is $c=1$. Since $1$ is an odd number, this formula complies with the nitrogen rule.\n\nTherefore, the formula $\\mathrm{C_5H_7NO_2}$ survives the pruning.\n\nThe number of surviving formulas is the total count of formulas in the final pruned set.

In mass spectrometry, the nitrogen rule is used to infer the parity of the number of nitrogen atoms $n_N$ from the parity of the nominal mass of a species, but it relies on assumptions about both elemental composition and electron count of the observed ion.\n\nUsing only first principles about electron pairing (closed-shell neutral species have an even number of electrons; odd-electron species have an odd number of electrons), integer nominal masses for the elements, and the effect of ionization on electron parity (removing or adding one electron toggles electron parity), analyze TEMPO and select the single statement that correctly explains why, for this nitroxide radical, the parity of the nominal mass alone cannot be used to infer $n_N$ via the nitrogen rule without additional information.\n\nCompute TEMPO’s nominal mass from its formula and then decide which statement is correct.\n\nA. TEMPO has nominal mass $156$ (even) but $n_N = 1$ (odd). Because TEMPO is an odd-electron neutral, electron removal by Electron Ionization (EI) produces an even-electron cation of the same nominal mass. The usual nitrogen rule that maps odd nominal mass to odd $n_N$ applies to odd-electron ions; for even-electron ions the mapping reverses. Therefore, without knowing whether the observed ion is odd- or even-electron (and how it was formed), nominal mass parity alone cannot determine $n_N$ for nitroxide radicals.\n\nB. TEMPO’s even nominal mass arises because oxygen has an odd nominal mass, which invalidates the nitrogen rule; one must instead correlate parity with the number of oxygen atoms.\n\nC.

Let's analyze the contribution of common elements to the nominal mass ($M$) and the total number of electrons ($N_e$) in a neutral molecule.\n-   The mass number ($A$) is the sum of protons ($Z$) and neutrons. The nominal mass of a molecule is the sum of the mass numbers of the most abundant isotopes of its constituent atoms.\n-   The total number of electrons ($N_e$) in a neutral molecule is the sum of the atomic numbers ($Z$) of its atoms. A molecule is closed-shell if $N_e$ is even, and an odd-electron species (a radical) if $N_e$ is odd.\n\nLet's examine the parity of $A$ and $Z$ for the elements in TEMPO:\n-   Hydrogen ($\\mathrm{^1H}$): $A=1$ (odd), $Z=1$ (odd).\n-   Carbon ($\\mathrm{^{12}C}$): $A=12$ (even), $Z=6$ (even).\n-   Oxygen ($\\mathrm{^{16}O}$): $A=16$ (even), $Z=8$ (even).\n-   Nitrogen ($\\mathrm{^{14}N}$): $A=14$ (even), $Z=7$ (odd).\n\nFor a molecule with formula $\\mathrm{C_xH_yN_{n_N}O_z}$, the parity of the nominal mass $M$ is:\n$M \\pmod 2 \\equiv (x \\cdot 12 + y \\cdot 1 + n_N \\cdot 14 + z \\cdot 16) \\pmod 2 \\equiv (y \\cdot 1) \\pmod 2 \\equiv y \\pmod 2$.\nThe parity of the nominal mass depends only on the parity of the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe parity of the total electron count $N_e$ is:\n$N_e \\pmod 2 \\equiv (x \\cdot 6 + y \\cdot 1 + n_N \\cdot 7 + z \\cdot 8) \\pmod 2 \\equiv (y \\cdot 1 + n_N \\cdot 1) \\pmod 2 \\equiv (y + n_N) \\pmod 2$.\n\n*   **Standard Case (Closed-Shell Neutral Molecule)**: For a stable, closed-shell molecule, $N_e$ must be even. Thus, $(y + n_N)$ must be even. This implies that $y$ and $n_N$ have the same parity. Since $M \\pmod 2 \\equiv y \\pmod 2$, it follows that $M \\pmod 2 \\equiv n_N \\pmod 2$. So, for a closed-shell neutral molecule, mass parity equals nitrogen-count parity. When this molecule is ionized by electron removal (e.g., EI), it forms an **odd-electron** molecular ion $[\\text{M}]^{+\\bullet}$ with the same nominal mass. The standard nitrogen rule—odd mass implies odd $n_N$—is thus formulated for these common **odd-electron ions**.\n\n*   **Radical Case (Odd-Electron Neutral Molecule)**: For a radical like TEMPO, $N_e$ must be odd. Thus, $(y + n_N)$ must be odd. This implies that $y$ and $n_N$ have opposite parity. Since $M \\pmod 2 \\equiv y \\pmod 2$, it follows that $M \\pmod 2 \\not\\equiv n_N \\pmod 2$. For a neutral radical, the mass parity is **opposite** to the nitrogen-count parity.\n\n**2. Analysis of TEMPO**\n\nLet's apply these principles to TEMPO, $\\mathrm{C_9H_{18}NO}$.\n-   $n_N = 1$ (odd).\n-   Number of hydrogens $y=18$ (even).\n-   TEMPO is a neutral radical, so its electron count must be odd. Our formula confirms this: $N_e \\pmod 2 \\equiv (y + n_N) \\pmod 2 \\equiv (18 + 1) \\pmod 2 \\equiv 19 \\pmod 2 \\equiv 1$ (odd).\n-   The nominal mass is $M = 9 \\times 12 + 18 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 14 + 1 \\times 16 = 108 + 18 + 14 + 16 = 156$. The mass is even.\n-   As predicted for a neutral radical, the mass parity (even) is opposite to the nitrogen-count parity (odd).\n\n**3. The Role of Ionization in Mass Spectrometry**\n\nIn a mass spectrometer, we observe ions, not neutral molecules.\n-   If TEMPO is ionized by electron removal (e.g., in Electron Ionization, EI), it forms a cation: $\\mathrm{C_9H_{18}NO} \\rightarrow (\\mathrm{C_9H_{18}NO})^{+} + e^{-}$.\n    -   The neutral molecule is an odd-electron species. Removing one electron results in an **even-electron** cation.\n    -   The nominal mass of this ion is $156$ (even).\n    -   Here we have an **even-electron ion** with an even mass and an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\n\n-   The standard nitrogen rule is formulated for odd-electron ions. A reversed rule applies to even-electron ions: for an even-electron ion, an even mass implies an odd number of nitrogen atoms, and an odd mass implies an even number of nitrogen atoms. Our TEMPO$^{+}$ ion ($M=156$, $n_N=1$) follows this reversed rule.\n\nThe ambiguity arises because an analyst observing a peak at $m/z=156$ (an even mass) does not know *a priori* whether the ion is an odd-electron or even-electron species.\n-   If they assume it's a typical odd-electron molecular ion, they would apply the standard rule and incorrectly conclude that $n_N$ is even.\n-   If they know it originated from a neutral radical and is therefore an even-electron ion, they would apply the reversed rule and correctly conclude that $n_N$ is odd.\n\nTherefore, the parity of the nominal mass alone is insufficient. One must also know the electron parity of the observed ion to choose the correct version of the nitrogen rule.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. TEMPO has nominal mass $156$ (even) but $n_N = 1$ (odd). Because TEMPO is an odd-electron neutral, electron removal by Electron Ionization (EI) produces an even-electron cation of the same nominal mass. The usual nitrogen rule that maps odd nominal mass to odd $n_N$ applies to odd-electron ions; for even-electron ions the mapping reverses. Therefore, without knowing whether the observed ion is odd- or even-electron (and how it was formed), nominal mass parity alone cannot determine $n_N$ for nitroxide radicals.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. It correctly calculates the mass ($156$), identifies the parities of mass (even) and $n_N$ (odd), correctly describes the electron count of the neutral and the resulting cation, and correctly states the dependence of the nitrogen rule on the ion's electron parity. This accurately explains the ambiguity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. TEMPO’s even nominal mass arises because oxygen has an odd nominal mass, which invalidates the nitrogen rule; one must instead correlate parity with the number of oxygen atoms.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The nominal mass of the most abundant isotope of oxygen, $\\mathrm{^{16}O}$, is $16$, which is an even number. The argument is based on a false premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The observed parity is dominated by $\\mathrm{^{15}N}$ isotopic contributions, making the nominal mass parity random in practice; thus the nitrogen rule is unusable for nitroxide radicals without isotopic resolution.**\nThe nitrogen rule is a concept applied to the nominal mass, which is defined by the most abundant isotopes ($\\mathrm{^{14}N}$, not $\\mathrm{^{15}N}$). The natural abundance of $\\mathrm{^{15}N}$ ($\\approx 0.37\\%$) is far too low to \"dominate\" parity. The issue is electronic, not isotopic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The unpaired electron in a nitroxide radical contributes $+1$ to the nominal mass, flipping the parity relative to closed-shell molecules; this extra mass explains why parity cannot be used to infer $n_N$ in nitroxides.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Nominal mass is calculated from the integer masses of protons and neutrons. Electrons have a mass of approximately $1/1836$ atomic mass units and are not counted in the calculation of nominal mass. An electron does not contribute $+1$ to the nominal mass.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3727448"}]}
