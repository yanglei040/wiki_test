It is based on the standard chemical principle of the index of hydrogen deficiency (or DBE). The molecular formula is valid, and the tasks are clearly defined and formalizable. The provided spectroscopic reference values are standard. The problem is self-contained and free from contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe first step is to calculate the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) for the given molecular formula, $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8\\text{Cl}_2\\text{N}_2$. The DBE quantifies the degree of unsaturation (rings and/or multiple bonds) in a molecule. The general formula for a compound with the composition $\\text{C}_c\\text{H}_h\\text{N}_n\\text{O}_o\\text{X}_x$, where $\\text{X}$ represents a halogen, is:\n$$\n\\text{DBE} = c - \\frac{h}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{x}{2} + 1\n$$\nAlternatively, one can use a conceptual approach. A saturated, acyclic reference compound containing $c$ carbons and $n$ nitrogens has a molecular formula of $\\text{C}_c\\text{H}_{2c+2+n}$. For the given compound, $c=8$ and $n=2$, so the saturated reference contains $2(8) + 2 + 2 = 20$ hydrogen atoms. The actual molecule has $h=8$ hydrogen atoms and $x=2$ chlorine atoms. Halogens are treated as hydrogen equivalents. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen-equivalent atoms is $h_{eq} = h + x = 8 + 2 = 10$.\n\nThe hydrogen deficiency is the difference between the number of hydrogens in the saturated reference and the number of hydrogen-equivalents in the actual molecule.\n$$\n\\text{Deficiency} = (2c+2+n) - (h+x) = 20 - 10 = 10\n$$\nSince each unit of DBE corresponds to a deficiency of two hydrogen atoms, the DBE is half of this value.\n$$\n\\text{DBE} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n$$\nThis result is confirmed using the standard formula:\n$$\n\\text{DBE} = 8 - \\frac{8}{2} + \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} + 1 = 8 - 4 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 5\n$$\nThe DBE is $5$.\n\nThe problem defines DBE as the sum of the number of rings, $r$, and the total multiple-bond contribution, $m$. The clarification that a triple bond (which contains two $\\pi$-bonds) contributes $2$ to $m$ confirms that $m$ is the total count of $\\pi$-bonds. Thus, we have the relation:\n$$\n\\text{DBE} = r + m\n$$\nWe must find all pairs of nonnegative integers $(r,m)$ that satisfy the equation $r + m = 5$. The possible pairs are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $(r,m) = (0, 5)$\n    \\item $(r,m) = (1, 4)$\n    \\item $(r,m) = (2, 3)$\n    \\item $(r,m) = (3, 2)$\n    \\item $(r,m) = (4, 1)$\n    \\item $(r,m) = (5, 0)$\n\\end{enumerate}\nThere are 6 such pairs.\n\nNext, we discuss the physical plausibility of structural families corresponding to these pairs. A DBE of $5$ is characteristic of many structures, but for a $\\text{C}_8$ formula, it strongly suggests the possibility of an aromatic ring. A benzene ring accounts for a DBE of $4$ (one ring and three $\\pi$-bonds).\n\n-   **$(r,m) = (1, 4)$ and $(r,m) = (2, 3)$**: These cases are highly plausible as they can accommodate an aromatic benzene ring. A benzene ring contributes $r=1$ and $m=3$. The remaining DBE of $1$ must be accounted for by the substituents.\n    -   For $(r,m) = (1, 4)$, the total structure has one ring and four $\\pi$-bonds. This corresponds to a benzene ring ($r=1, m=3$) plus one additional $\\pi$-bond ($m=1$) in a substituent. This extra $\\pi$-bond could be a $\\text{C=C}$, $\\text{C=N}$ (imine), or $\\text{N=N}$ (azo) group. A structure with a dichlorophenyl group and a side chain containing a double bond, such as $N$-((dichlorophenyl)methyl)methanimine, fits this description. Spectroscopically, one would expect signals for an aromatic ring (IR peaks near $1600~\\text{cm}^{-1}$; $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR signals at $\\delta 6.5$–$8.5$) plus evidence of the additional multiple bond (e.g., an imine $\\text{C=N}$ stretch near $1650~\\text{cm}^{-1}$).\n    -   For $(r,m) = (2, 3)$, the structure has two rings and three $\\pi$-bonds. This could be a benzene ring ($r=1, m=3$) fused or attached to a saturated ring ($r=1, m=0$). An example would be a dichlorophenyl substituent attached to a saturated nitrogen-containing heterocycle, like N-($2,4$-dichlorophenyl)azetidine. Spectroscopic evidence would include aromatic signals combined with aliphatic signals from the saturated ring.\n\n-   **$(r,m) = (0, 5)$**: An acyclic structure with five $\\pi$-bonds. Given the presence of two nitrogen atoms, a structure with two nitrile ($\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{N}$) groups is plausible. Each nitrile group contributes $m=2$, for a total of $m=4$. The remaining DBE of $1$ would be a $\\text{C=C}$ double bond. A possible structure would be a dichlorinated, unsaturated dinitrile hydrocarbon chain. The key spectroscopic signature would be a strong, sharp absorption in the IR spectrum near $2250~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ characteristic of the $\\text{C}\\equiv\\text{N}$ stretch, and the absence of aromatic proton signals in the $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum.\n\n-   **$(r,m) = (3, 2)$, $(4, 1)$, and $(5, 0)$**: These pairs correspond to polycyclic structures with few or no $\\pi$-bonds.\n    -   $(r,m)=(5,0)$ corresponds to a saturated pentacyclic cage structure. For example, the hydrocarbon framework could be cuneane or cubane (both $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8$, DBE=$5$, $r=5, m=0$), with atoms substituted to match the formula $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8\\text{Cl}_2\\text{N}_2$. While structurally valid, such highly strained cage compounds are less common than aromatic structures. Spectroscopy would show complex aliphatic signals and a complete absence of olefinic or aromatic features.\n    -   The pairs $(r,m) = (3, 2)$ and $(r,m) = (4, 1)$ represent other polycyclic frameworks with one or two $\\pi$-bonds. These are also structurally possible but represent less common families of compounds compared to those containing an aromatic ring.\n\nIn summary, while all six $(r,m)$ pairs are mathematically possible, chemical precedent suggests that structures containing an aromatic ring (e.g., those corresponding to pairs $(1,4)$ and $(2,3)$) or nitrile groups (contributing to the $(0,5)$ or $(1,4)$ cases) are the most plausible candidates for a compound with formula $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8\\text{Cl}_2\\text{N}_2$.\n\nThe final task is to report the total number of nonnegative integer pairs $(r,m)$ consistent with the computed DBE.

This allows one to trace out contiguous fragments of protonated carbons, such as an ethyl group ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$) or the protons on an aromatic ring. However, COSY provides no information about quaternary carbons, as they lack protons. Furthermore, it cannot establish a connection between two proton spin systems if they are separated by a quaternary carbon or a heteroatom (like the oxygen in an ether or ester). For a molecule with formula $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O}$ (DBE = $4$), the presence of a benzene ring is highly probable, which guarantees the existence of at least one quaternary carbon. Thus, COSY alone is **insufficient** to assemble the full skeleton.\n\n2.  **HSQC ($^{1}\\text{H}$–$^{13}\\text{C}$ One-Bond Correlation)**: This experiment correlates each proton signal to the signal of the carbon atom to which it is directly attached ($^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$). This allows for the unambiguous assignment of every proton to its parent carbon, effectively identifying all $\\text{CH}$, $\\text{CH}_2$, and $\\text{CH}_3$ groups. However, HSQC provides no information about connectivity *between* atoms. It does not reveal which carbons are bonded to each other, nor does it provide any information about quaternary carbons (as they have no attached protons). Therefore, HSQC alone is **insufficient**.\n\n3.  **HMBC ($^{1}\\text{H}$–$^{13}\\text{C}$ Multiple-Bond Correlation)**: This experiment shows correlations between protons and carbons that are separated by $2$ or $3$ bonds ($^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$, $^{3}J_{\\text{CH}}$). Critically, it provides correlations from protons to quaternary carbons. For example, the methyl protons of a tert-butyl group ($(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{C}-$) will show a $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation to the central quaternary carbon. This ability to \"see\" across non-protonated centers is essential for connecting molecular fragments.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the proposed combinations of experiments for sufficiency and minimality.\n\n- **{COSY, HSQC}**: COSY identifies proton spin systems, and HSQC links those protons to their carbons. This combination can build protonated carbon fragments (e.g., $...-\\text{CH(a)}-\\text{CH(b)}-\\text{CH(c)}-...$). However, it cannot bridge a gap created by a quaternary carbon or a heteroatom. For instance, in 4-ethylphenol, this pair of experiments could identify the ethyl group fragment and the aromatic AA'BB' fragment, but it could not establish the bond between them because they are separated by a quaternary carbon. This set is **insufficient**.\n\n- **{HSQC, HMBC}**: This combination is powerful. HSQC provides the fundamental link: \"Proton $H_i$ is on Carbon $C_i$.\" This gives us an unambiguous starting point for every protonated carbon. Then, HMBC provides the long-range connections. A correlation in the HMBC from proton $H_i$ (on $C_i$) to another carbon $C_j$ establishes a $2$- or $3$-bond connectivity between $C_i$ and $C_j$. By systematically assembling these HMBC-derived connectivities, one can link all fragments together. Crucially, because HMBC shows correlations to quaternary carbons, it provides the necessary information to bridge the gaps that COSY and HSQC cannot. For example, if a proton on $C_i$ shows an HMBC correlation to a quaternary carbon $C_q$, the link $C_i - ... - C_q$ is established. By observing correlations to $C_q$ from protons on different fragments, the full structure around $C_q$ can be elucidated. This set is **sufficient**. Is it minimal? We must consider if COSY adds *necessary* information. The connectivity information from COSY (e.g., a $^{3}J_{\\text{HH}}$ coupling indicating a $H_i-C_i-C_j-H_j$ fragment) is often redundant if HMBC is available. The same $C_i-C_j$ bond can be established via a $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation from $H_i$ to $C_j$ and from $H_j$ to $C_i$. Therefore, COSY is not strictly necessary for skeleton assembly, making the {HSQC, HMBC} set minimal.\n\n- **{HMBC only}**: Without HSQC, we have a set of long-range correlations from protons to carbons, but we lack the crucial one-bond correlation. An HMBC spectrum shows that proton signal $H_A$ correlates to carbon signals $C_X$, $C_Y$, and $C_Z$. To use this information, we MUST know which carbon $H_A$ is attached to. Is it $C_X$? $C_Y$? $C_Z$? Or another carbon, $C_A$? The HMBC experiment is typically optimized to suppress the one-bond correlation, so we cannot assume it is one of them. We need the HSQC experiment to provide the anchor: \"$H_A$ is on $C_A$.\" Without this anchor, the long-range correlations cannot be unambiguously traced to build a unique structure. This set is **insufficient**.\n\n- **{COSY, HSQC, HMBC}**: This set is clearly sufficient, as it contains the sufficient subset {HSQC, HMBC}. However, since {HSQC, HMBC} is itself sufficient, this larger set is not minimal. COSY provides useful corroborating evidence but is not strictly necessary for the task of skeleton building if the other two are present. This set is **not minimal**.\n\nThe minimal set of experiments sufficient to reconstruct the carbon skeleton, including connections across quaternary centers, is {HSQC, HMBC}.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. HSQC and HMBC; justification: HSQC assigns each $^{1}\\text{H}$ to its directly bonded $^{13}\\text{C}$, partitioning protons among specific carbons, while HMBC supplies $2$–$3$ bond H–C connectivities that traverse quaternary carbons, allowing assembly of the full C–C network without requiring $^{1}\\text{H}$–$^{1}\\text{H}$ couplings.**\nThe chosen set, {HSQC, HMBC}, is the minimal sufficient set as determined by the derivation above. The justification provided is entirely correct. HSQC provides the essential one-bond assignments, which serve as anchors. HMBC provides the crucial long-range correlations needed to connect all carbon fragments, especially across non-protonated atoms like quaternary carbons. The justification correctly notes that $^{1}\\text{H}$–$^{1}\\text{H}$ couplings (from COSY) are not required, thus establishing the minimality of this set.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. COSY and HSQC; justification: COSY maps $^{1}\\text{H}$ spin systems and HSQC links those protons to attached carbons, which together reveal all C–C connectivities, including quaternary centers, making HMBC unnecessary.**\nThis option is incorrect. The set {COSY, HSQC} is insufficient. The justification makes the false claim that this combination can reveal connectivity involving quaternary centers. Neither experiment provides information about the existence of or connections to a quaternary carbon. HMBC is necessary for this purpose.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. COSY only; justification: $^{1}\\text{H}$–$^{1}\\text{H}$ coupling patterns and chemical shifts are sufficient to deduce the complete skeleton of $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_{10}\\text{O}$, even when quaternary carbons are present.**\nThis option is incorrect. The set {COSY} is insufficient. As reasoned above, COSY cannot establish connectivities between spin systems separated by a quaternary carbon or heteroatom. The justification's claim that it can handle quaternary carbons is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. HMBC only; justification: long-range $^{2}J_{\\text{CH}}$ and $^{3}J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlations from all protons to nearby carbons are adequate to connect the entire skeleton, rendering direct $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ information about which proton sits on which carbon superfluous.**\nThis option is incorrect. The set {HMBC} is insufficient. The justification is flawed because the direct $^{1}J_{\\text{CH}}$ information (provided by HSQC) is not superfluous; it is essential. Without knowing the carbon a proton is attached to, the long-range HMBC correlations lack a definite starting point, making unambiguous structure assembly impossible.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. COSY, HSQC, and HMBC; justification: using all three guarantees the skeleton can be reconstructed because each experiment contributes complementary information, and therefore this set is minimal by sufficiency.**\nThis option is incorrect. While the set is sufficient, it is not minimal. The justification contains a logical error: sufficiency does not imply minimality (\"minimal by sufficiency\" is not a valid principle). As established, the set {HSQC, HMBC} is also sufficient, and since it is a proper subset of {COSY, HSQC, HMBC}, the latter cannot be minimal.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3725887"}]}
