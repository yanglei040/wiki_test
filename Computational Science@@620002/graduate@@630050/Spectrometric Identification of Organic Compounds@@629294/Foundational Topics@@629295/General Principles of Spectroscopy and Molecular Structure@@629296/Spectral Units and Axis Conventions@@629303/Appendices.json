Conversion from Wavelength ($\\lambda$) to Photon Energy ($E$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon, $E$, is related to its frequency, $\\nu$, by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$\nE = h\\nu\n$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant. The frequency is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ and the speed of light in vacuum $c$ by:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu$ into the energy equation gives the energy in terms of wavelength:\n$$\nE = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis formula yields the energy in SI units (Joules) if $h$, $c$, and $\\lambda$ are in SI units. The problem requires the energy in electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$). An electron-volt is the amount of kinetic energy gained by a single electron when it is accelerated through an electric potential difference of one volt. This energy is equal to the product of the elementary charge, $e$, and the potential difference ($1\\,\\mathrm{V}$).

Discussion of Spectral Appearance: Wavenumber vs. Wavelength Axes**\n\nThe transformation from a wavelength axis ($\\lambda$) to a wavenumber axis ($\\tilde{\\nu}$) is a non-linear reciprocal relationship, $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1/\\lambda$. This non-linearity profoundly alters the visual appearance and quantitative properties of a spectral band.\n\n*   **Center Location**: The location of the absorption maximum is simply transformed according to the reciprocal relationship. The peak at $\\lambda_0 = 280\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ moves to $\\tilde{\\nu}_0 = 3.571 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, as calculated above.\n\n*   **Bandwidth**: The relationship between a small interval in wavelength, $d\\lambda$, and the corresponding interval in wavenumber, $d\\tilde{\\nu}$, is found by differentiation:\n    $$\n    d\\tilde{\\nu} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} d\\lambda\n    $$\n    The magnitude of a finite bandwidth $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$ corresponding to a bandwidth $\\Delta\\lambda$ centered at $\\lambda$ is approximately:\n    $$\n    |\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}| \\approx \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} |\\Delta\\lambda|\n    $$\n    This shows that a constant bandwidth in the wavelength domain, $\\Delta\\lambda$, does not map to a constant bandwidth in the wavenumber domain. The factor $1/\\lambda^2$ makes the wavenumber bandwidth strongly dependent on the center wavelength. For our UV band at a small $\\lambda$ ($280\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), the factor $1/\\lambda^2$ is large, meaning the band will appear broader in the $\\tilde{\\nu}$ domain than a band of the same $\\Delta\\lambda$ in the infrared (where $\\lambda$ is large).\n\n*   **Symmetry**: A spectral band that is symmetric on the wavelength axis will be asymmetric on the wavenumber axis. For example, consider a band with a Gaussian shape in $\\lambda$, described by the absorbance $A(\\lambda)$:\n    $$\n    A(\\lambda) = A_{max} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)^2}{2\\sigma_\\lambda^2} \\right)\n    $$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the center and $\\sigma_\\lambda$ is related to the bandwidth. To plot this on a wavenumber axis, we substitute $\\lambda = 1/\\tilde{\\nu}$, yielding the new function for absorbance, $A'(\\tilde{\\nu})$:\n    $$\n    A'(\\tilde{\\nu}) = A(\\lambda(\\tilde{\\nu})) = A_{max} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(1/\\tilde{\\nu} - 1/\\tilde{\\nu}_0)^2}{2\\sigma_\\lambda^2} \\right)\n    $$\n    where $\\tilde{\\nu}_0 = 1/\\lambda_0$. This new function is not a Gaussian in $\\tilde{\\nu}$ and is not symmetric about $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$. The band becomes distorted, typically exhibiting a \"tail\" on the low-wavenumber (long-wavelength) side. This is because a fixed interval on the $\\lambda$ axis corresponds to a larger interval on the $\\tilde{\\nu}$ axis for smaller $\\lambda$ (higher $\\tilde{\\nu}$) and a smaller interval for larger $\\lambda$ (lower $\\tilde{\\nu}$).\n\n*   **Intensity and Jacobian Factor**: When simply replotting the absorbance values, the peak maximum height, $A_{max}$, remains unchanged because $A'(\\tilde{\\nu}_0) = A(\\lambda_0) = A_{max}$. However, the integrated intensity, or the area under the curve, is not conserved. The area in the wavenumber domain, Area$_{\\tilde{\\nu}}$, is related to the area in the wavelength domain, Area$_{\\lambda}$, by:\n    $$\n    \\text{Area}_{\\tilde{\\nu}} = \\int A'(\\tilde{\\nu}) \\, d\\tilde{\\nu} = \\int A(\\lambda(\\tilde{\\nu})) \\, d\\tilde{\\nu}\n    $$\n    Changing the variable of integration from $\\tilde{\\nu}$ to $\\lambda$ using $d\\tilde{\\nu} = (-1/\\lambda^2) d\\lambda$ gives:\n    $$\n    \\text{Area}_{\\tilde{\\nu}} = \\int_{\\lambda_{start}}^{\\lambda_{end}} A(\\lambda) \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\right) d\\lambda = \\int_{\\lambda_{end}}^{\\lambda_{start}} \\frac{A(\\lambda)}{\\lambda^2} d\\lambda\n    $$\n    The term $1/\\lambda^2$ is the Jacobian of the transformation for the spectral density. It re-weights the absorbance at each point. This demonstrates that a simple replotting of absorbance does not conserve the area. For fundamental physical interpretations related to transition probabilities (oscillator strengths), it is the integral over frequency, $\\int \\epsilon(\\nu) d\\nu$, or wavenumber, $\\int \\epsilon(\\tilde{\\nu}) d\\tilde{\\nu}$, that is the most meaningful quantity, as both frequency and wavenumber are directly proportional to energy ($E = h\\nu = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$), which is the physically conserved quantity in a quantum transition. The transformation from $\\lambda$ to $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is favored because it creates a linear energy scale, making band shapes and areas more directly interpretable in terms of molecular energetics.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3.571 \\times 10^4 & 4.428\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3724309"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercise, this problem provides a concrete numerical example to illustrate the non-linear relationship between wavelength and energy.

In both cases, the separation in wavelength is identical: $\\Delta\\lambda = 10\\,\\text{nm}$. However, the corresponding separation in wavenumber (and thus energy) is drastically different. The $10\\,\\text{nm}$ separation near $200\\,\\text{nm}$ corresponds to an energy difference of approximately $2502\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, while the same $10\\,\\text{nm}$ separation near $400\\,\\text{nm}$ corresponds to an energy difference of only $625.1\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThis calculation explicitly demonstrates the non-linear, reciprocal relationship between wavelength and energy. Specifically, for a constant interval in wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda$, the corresponding energy interval, $\\Delta E$, is much larger at shorter wavelengths (higher energy regions) than at longer wavelengths (lower energy regions). The relationship can be approximated for small $\\Delta\\lambda$ as $|\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}| \\approx \\frac{|\\Delta\\lambda|}{\\lambda^2}$, showing that the wavenumber difference is inversely proportional to the square of the central wavelength.\n\nWhen assigning electronic or vibronic transitions, representing spectra on an axis that is linear with energy (such as wavenumber in $\\text{cm}^{-1}$ or energy in $\\text{eV}$) is critically important. Vibronic progressions, for example, which arise from transitions to successive vibrational levels within an excited electronic state, are expected to show a series of peaks that are approximately equally spaced in energy. This equal spacing will be immediately apparent on a wavenumber-scaled spectrum. If the same spectrum were plotted on a wavelength axis, these same transitions would appear with progressively smaller separations as wavelength increases. This distortion can make it difficult to identify such progressions and accurately determine the characteristic vibrational frequencies of the molecule in its excited state. Therefore, for quantitative analysis and the correct assignment of transitions based on energy level spacings, a wavenumber (or other energy-proportional) axis is scientifically superior to a wavelength axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2502 & 625.1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3724371"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem moves into the realm of experimental reality by incorporating instrumental uncertainty.
