The energy of a photon absorbed in this transition is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{trans}} = hf$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.

Let us denote the wavelength in a medium with refractive index $n$ as $\\lambda_n$. Thus, we have:\n$$\\lambda_n = \\frac{v}{f}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v$:\n$$\\lambda_n = \\frac{c/n}{f} = \\frac{c}{nf}$$\nThis equation shows the relationship between the wavelength in the medium, the refractive index of the medium, and the frequency of the light. We can rearrange this to express the product $n \\lambda_n$:\n$$n \\lambda_n = \\frac{c}{f}$$\nSince both $c$ and $f$ are constant for this specific electronic transition, the product $n \\lambda_n$ must also be a constant, regardless of the solvent. This constant product is equal to the wavelength of the light in a vacuum, $\\lambda_0 = c/f$.\n\nTherefore, we can equate this product for the two different solvents, hexane ($\\mathrm{hex}$) and acetonitrile ($\\mathrm{MeCN}$):\n$$n_{\\mathrm{hex}} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{hex}} = n_{\\mathrm{MeCN}} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{MeCN}}$$\nWe are given the values for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{hex}}$, $n_{\\mathrm{hex}}$, and $n_{\\mathrm{MeCN}}$, and we need to determine $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{MeCN}}$.
