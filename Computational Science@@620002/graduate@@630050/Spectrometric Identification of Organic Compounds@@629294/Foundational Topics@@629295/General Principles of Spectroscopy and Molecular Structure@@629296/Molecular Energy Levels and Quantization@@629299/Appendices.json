A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two parts: first, the moment of inertia $I$, and second, the rotational constant $B$.\n\n**Part 1: Moment of Inertia, $I$**\n\nLet the two masses be $m_1$ and $m_2$. They are separated by a fixed distance $R$. The axis of rotation passes through the center of mass (CM) of the system. Let the CM be the origin of our coordinate system. Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the distances of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ from the CM, respectively. The masses lie on a line, so the total separation distance is the sum of their individual distances from the CM:\n$$R = r_1 + r_2$$\nBy the definition of the center of mass, the first moment of mass about the CM is zero:\n$$m_1 r_1 = m_2 r_2$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $r_1$ and $r_2$. We can solve for $r_1$ and $r_2$ in terms of $m_1$, $m_2$, and $R$. From the second equation, we express $r_2$ as $r_2 = \\frac{m_1}{m_2} r_1$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$r_1 + \\frac{m_1}{m_2} r_1 = R$$\n$$r_1 \\left( 1 + \\frac{m_1}{m_2} \\right) = R$$\n$$r_1 \\left( \\frac{m_2 + m_1}{m_2} \\right) = R$$\n$$r_1 = \\frac{m_2 R}{m_1 + m_2}$$\nSimilarly, we can solve for $r_2$:\n$$r_2 = R - r_1 = R - \\frac{m_2 R}{m_1 + m_2} = \\frac{R(m_1 + m_2) - m_2 R}{m_1 + m_2} = \\frac{m_1 R}{m_1 + m_2}$$\nThe moment of inertia, $I$, for a system of point masses rotating about an axis is defined as $I = \\sum_i m_i r_i^2$. For our diatomic molecule, this is:\n$$I = m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$I = m_1 \\left( \\frac{m_2 R}{m_1 + m_2} \\right)^2 + m_2 \\left( \\frac{m_1 R}{m_1 + m_2} \\right)^2$$\n$$I = \\frac{m_1 m_2^2 R^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} + \\frac{m_2 m_1^2 R^2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}$$\n$$I = \\frac{m_1 m_2 R^2 (m_2 + m_1)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}$$\n$$I = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} R^2$$\nThis is the expression for the moment of inertia. The term $\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$ is known as the reduced mass of the system. Thus, $I = \\mu R^2$. Assuming $m_1$ and $m_2$ are in $\\text{kg}$ and $R$ is in $\\text{m}$, the unit of $I$ is $\\text{kg m}^2$, as required.\n\n**Part 2: Rotational Constant, $B$**\n\nThe classical rotational kinetic energy, $E$, is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{L^2}{2I}$$\nwhere $L$ is the magnitude of the angular momentum. According to quantum mechanics, the angular momentum of a rigid rotor is quantized. The square of the angular momentum operator, $\\hat{L}^2$, has eigenvalues given by $L^2 = \\hbar^2 J(J+1)$, where $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$) and $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$ is the reduced Planck constant.\nSubstituting the quantized values of $L^2$ into the energy expression gives the quantized rotational energy levels, $E_J$:\n$$E_J = \\frac{\\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2I} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 J(J+1)}{2I} = \\frac{h^2 J(J+1)}{8 \\pi^2 I}$$\nThis expression gives the energy levels in Joules. To express these levels in wavenumbers ($\\text{cm}^{-1}$), we use the relation $E=hc\\tilde{\\nu_E}$, where $\\tilde{\\nu_E}$ represents the energy in wavenumbers. The problem specifies to use the speed of light $c$ in units of $\\text{cm s}^{-1}$ for this conversion. The rotational energy levels in wavenumbers, which we denote as $F(J)$, are:\n$$F(J) = \\frac{E_J}{hc} = \\frac{1}{hc} \\left( \\frac{h^2 J(J+1)}{8 \\pi^2 I} \\right) = \\frac{h}{8 \\pi^2 I c} J(J+1)$$\nThe problem defines the rotational constant $B$ as the coefficient multiplying $J(J+1)$ in this expression. By inspection, we find:\n$$B = \\frac{h}{8 \\pi^2 I c}$$\nThe problem requires the final expression for $B$ in terms of $m_1$, $m_2$, $R$, $h$, $c$, and $\\pi$. We must substitute the derived expression for $I$:\n$$B = \\frac{h}{8 \\pi^2 c \\left( \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} R^2 \\right)}$$\nSimplifying this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $(m_1 + m_2)$ gives:\n$$B = \\frac{h(m_1 + m_2)}{8 \\pi^2 c m_1 m_2 R^2}$$\nWith $h$ in J·s (i.e., $\\text{kg m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}$), $I$ in $\\text{kg m}^2$, and $c$ in $\\text{cm s}^{-1}$, the units of $B$ are $\\text{cm}^{-1}$, as required.\n\nThe two final expressions are:\n1. $I = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} R^2$\n2. $B = \\frac{h(m_1 + m_2)}{8 \\pi^2 c m_1 m_2 R^2}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} R^2 & \\frac{h(m_1 + m_2)}{8 \\pi^2 c m_1 m_2 R^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3713439"}, {"introduction": "The quantum harmonic oscillator provides a powerful, albeit simplified, model for molecular vibrations.

The analysis is based on modeling the molecular vibration as a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO).\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. The energy levels, $E_v$, of a QHO are quantized according to the equation:\n$$E_v = \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)h\\nu$$\nwhere $v$ is the vibrational quantum number ($v=0, 1, 2, \\dots$), $h$ is Planck's constant, and $\\nu$ is the fundamental vibrational frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe fundamental vibrational transition, which is typically the most intense in an IR spectrum, corresponds to the absorption of a photon that excites the oscillator from the ground state ($v=0$) to the first excited state ($v=1$).

Substituting the expression for $\\nu$, we get:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$$\nThe problem states that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation holds, which implies that the potential energy surface, and thus the force constant $k$ of the bond, is independent of the nuclear masses. Therefore, $k$ remains unchanged upon isotopic substitution. Consequently, the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ depends only on the reduced mass $\\mu$:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu}}$$\nLet us denote the parameters for the normal $^{12}\\mathrm{C}^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ carbonyl as $\\tilde{\\nu}_1$ and $\\mu_1$, and for the isotopically substituted $^{13}\\mathrm{C}^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ carbonyl as $\\tilde{\\nu}_2$ and $\\mu_2$. We can form a ratio to express the scaling relationship:\n$$\\frac{\\tilde{\\nu}_2}{\\tilde{\\nu}_1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_2}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu_1}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\mu_2}}$$\nThis provides the desired expression for how the wavenumber scales:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = \\tilde{\\nu}_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\mu_2}}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the new wavenumber.

The key principle is that the change in vibrational frequency is highly specific to the vibration involving the substituted atom. A complex organic molecule has many vibrational modes, resulting in numerous peaks in its IR spectrum. Assigning each peak to a specific molecular motion can be challenging. By selectively replacing an atom in a specific functional group with a heavier isotope (e.g., $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ with $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ in a carbonyl group), one can introduce a predictable mass change at a known location.\n\nIf an experimentalist synthesizes a compound with a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$-labeled carbonyl and observes that a peak at $\\approx 1715\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ in the unlabeled compound's spectrum shifts down to $\\approx 1677\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ in the labeled compound's spectrum, this provides unambiguous evidence that this specific absorption band arises from the carbonyl stretching vibration. Other vibrational bands in the spectrum that do not significantly involve the motion of the carbonyl carbon will remain largely unshifted.

General Expression for Transition Wavenumber**\n\nThe selection rule for vibrational transitions is $\\Delta v = \\pm 1$. We are interested in the absorption transition from a level $v$ to the next level $v+1$. The wavenumber of this transition, denoted $\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1}$, is the difference between the term values of the final and initial states:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1} = G(v+1) - G(v)\n$$\nTo derive the general expression, we first write out the term value for the state $v+1$:\n$$\nG(v+1) = \\omega_{e} \\left((v+1) + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\omega_{e} x_{e} \\left((v+1) + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\omega_{e} \\left(v + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) - \\omega_{e} x_{e} \\left(v + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\nNow, we compute the difference $G(v+1) - G(v)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1} = \\left[ \\omega_{e} \\left(v + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) - \\omega_{e} x_{e} \\left(v + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 \\right] - \\left[ \\omega_{e} \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\omega_{e} x_{e} \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nGrouping terms with $\\omega_{e}$ and $\\omega_{e} x_{e}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1} = \\omega_{e} \\left[ \\left(v + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) - \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] - \\omega_{e} x_{e} \\left[ \\left(v + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nThe first bracketed term simplifies to $1$. The second bracketed term is a difference of squares, $a^2-b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$, where $a = v + \\frac{3}{2}$ and $b = v + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$\n\\left(v + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) - \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(v + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) + \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2v + 2 = 2(v+1)\n$$\nThus, the difference of squares is $(1)(2(v+1)) = 2(v+1)$. Substituting these results back into the expression for $\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1} = \\omega_{e}(1) - \\omega_{e} x_{e}(2(v+1)) = \\omega_{e} - 2\\omega_{e} x_{e}(v+1)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the wavenumber of the transition from vibrational level $v$ to $v+1$.\n\n**2. Physical Origin of Decreasing Level Spacing**\n\nThe derived expression $\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1} = \\omega_{e} - 2\\omega_{e} x_{e}(v+1)$ shows that the spacing between adjacent levels, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1}$, is not constant but depends on the quantum number $v$. Since $\\omega_{e}$ and $x_{e}$ are positive constants for a bound electronic state, the term $2\\omega_{e} x_{e}(v+1)$ increases as $v$ increases. Consequently, the transition wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_{v \\to v+1}$ decreases with increasing $v$.\n\nThe physical origin of this phenomenon lies in the true shape of the internuclear potential energy curve, which is not perfectly parabolic as in the simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) model. A more realistic model, like the Morse potential, accounts for the fact that a chemical bond will break if stretched too far. The potential energy curve for a real molecule is wider and shallower at higher energies compared to the SHO parabola. At large internuclear separations, the potential flattens, approaching the dissociation energy, $D_e$. This wider potential well provides less confinement for the vibrating nuclei at higher vibrational energies (higher $v$). Analogous to the \"particle in a box\" problem where energy level spacings decrease as the box size increases, the less confining nature of the anharmonic potential at higher energies causes the vibrational energy levels to become more closely spaced. This convergence of energy levels continues until the spacing approaches zero at the dissociation limit, where the quantized levels merge into a continuum of unbound states.\n\n**3.
