Both use the same detector and front-end electronics so that the additive detector noise can be modeled as zero-mean white Gaussian noise with two-sided power spectral density $N_{0}$ that is independent of optical signal level (detector-noise-limited regime). Let the mean signal associated with one spectral element at the detector for the dispersive instrument be $I_{0}$ (expressed in the same electrical units as the detector output), and let the optical throughput (etendue) of the FTIR relative to the dispersive instrument at the same resolution be the dimensionless ratio $\\Gamma \\equiv \\Phi_{\\mathrm{FTIR}}/\\Phi_{\\mathrm{disp}}$.

The derivation proceeds by analyzing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each spectrometer individually, based on the provided first principles, and then calculating their ratio.\n\nFirst, we analyze the scanning dispersive monochromator. This instrument measures each of the $N$ resolvable spectral elements sequentially. Given a total measurement time $T$, the time spent acquiring the signal for a single spectral element is $t_{\\mathrm{disp}} = \\frac{T}{N}$. The mean signal associated with one spectral element is given as $S_{\\mathrm{disp}} = I_0$. The noise is additive, zero-mean white Gaussian noise with a two-sided power spectral density (PSD) of $N_0$. The measurement for a single element is effectively a time-average of the signal plus noise over the interval $t_{\\mathrm{disp}}$. The variance of the time-average of white noise with a two-sided PSD $N_0$ over a finite interval $\\tau$ is $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{N_0}{2\\tau}$. For the dispersive instrument, this time interval is $\\tau = t_{\\mathrm{disp}}$. Thus, the noise variance for a single spectral element measurement is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{disp}}^2 = \\frac{N_0}{2 t_{\\mathrm{disp}}} = \\frac{N_0}{2 \\left(\\frac{T}{N}\\right)} = \\frac{N_0 N}{2T}\n$$\nThe noise standard deviation, $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{disp}}$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{disp}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{N_0 N}{2T}}\n$$\nThe signal-to-noise ratio for the dispersive instrument, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{disp}}$, is defined as the ratio of the mean signal to its standard deviation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{disp}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{disp}}}{\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{disp}}} = \\frac{I_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{N_0 N}{2T}}}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the Michelson-based Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. This instrument measures all $N$ spectral elements simultaneously over the entire measurement duration $T$. The resulting interferogram is then Fourier transformed to yield the spectrum. This process corresponds to projecting the time-domain signal onto a set of orthogonal sinusoidal basis functions. The problem specifies that the system is in the detector-noise-limited regime, meaning the noise PSD $N_0$ is independent of the optical signal level.\n\nThe signal for each spectral element benefits from the throughput (or Jacquinot) advantage, represented by the factor $\\Gamma$.

All parameters are physically realistic for a mid-infrared monochromator, and the requested derivations are based on fundamental principles of optics. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions.\n\nThe solution is derived in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Instrument Function and Spatial FWHM\n\nThe instrument function at the exit plane describes the measured intensity profile for a monochromatic input. It is given by the convolution of the entrance slit's image with the exit slit's transmission profile.\n\nLet the spatial coordinate at the focal plane be $x$. The entrance slit has a width $w_{\\mathrm{e}}$. With a magnification $M$, its image at the exit plane has a width $w'_{\\mathrm{e}} = M w_{\\mathrm{e}}$. The problem states unit magnification, so $M=1$ and $w'_{\\mathrm{e}} = w_{\\mathrm{e}}$. We can model the entrance slit image and the exit slit as rectangular functions, $\\mathrm{rect}(x/w)$, of widths $w'_{\\mathrm{e}}$ and $w_{\\mathrm{x}}$, respectively.\n\nThe instrument function $I(x)$ is their convolution:\n$$I(x) = \\mathrm{rect}\\left(\\frac{x}{w'_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\right) * \\mathrm{rect}\\left(\\frac{x}{w_{\\mathrm{x}}}\\right)$$\nIn this problem, we are given $w_{\\mathrm{e}} = w_{\\mathrm{x}} = 80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Let's denote this common width by $w = 80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Since $M=1$, we have $w'_{\\mathrm{e}} = w_{\\mathrm{e}} = w$. The instrument function is the convolution of two identical rectangular functions of width $w$. This convolution results in a triangular function, $\\Lambda(x/w)$, with a base width of $2w$ and a maximum height at $x=0$. The functional form is proportional to $(w - |x|)$ for $|x| \\le w$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe full width at half maximum (FWHM) is the width of the triangular function at half its maximum amplitude. The maximum amplitude occurs at $x=0$. We seek the value of $|x|$ for which the amplitude is halved:\n$$w - |x| = \\frac{1}{2} w$$\n$$|x| = \\frac{w}{2}$$\nThe two points at half-maximum are $x = -w/2$ and $x = +w/2$. The FWHM is the distance between them:\n$$\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = \\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{w}{2}\\right) = w$$\nIn the general case where $w'_{\\mathrm{e}} \\neq w_{\\mathrm{x}}$, the convolution gives a trapezoidal function, and the FWHM is $\\max(w'_{\\mathrm{e}}, w_{\\mathrm{x}})$. For our case, this gives $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = \\max(w_{\\mathrm{e}}, w_{\\mathrm{x}}) = w = 80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n### Part 2: Reciprocal Linear Dispersion\n\nThe reciprocal linear dispersion, $dx/d\\lambda$, relates the spatial position at the focal plane to the wavelength. We start with the grating equation:\n$$m\\lambda = d(\\sin\\alpha + \\sin\\beta)$$\nwhere $m$ is the diffraction order, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, $d$ is the groove spacing, $\\alpha$ is the angle of incidence, and $\\beta$ is the angle of diffraction. For a given instrument setup, $\\alpha$ is fixed. Differentiating with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$m = d \\cos\\beta \\frac{d\\beta}{d\\lambda}$$\nThe angular dispersion is therefore:\n$$\\frac{d\\beta}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{m}{d \\cos\\beta}$$\nWe are given the paraxial imaging relation $x \\approx f\\beta$, where $f$ is the focal length. Differentiating $x$ with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{dx}{d\\beta} = f$$\nUsing the chain rule, the reciprocal linear dispersion is:\n$$\\frac{dx}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{dx}{d\\beta}\\frac{d\\beta}{d\\lambda} = f \\frac{m}{d \\cos\\beta}$$\nWe must evaluate this at the center wavelength $\\lambda_{0} = 5.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. At this wavelength, the monochromator operates in a Littrow configuration, where $\\alpha = \\beta$. Let this angle be $\\beta_0$. The grating equation becomes:\n$$m\\lambda_0 = 2d\\sin\\beta_0 \\implies \\sin\\beta_0 = \\frac{m\\lambda_0}{2d}$$\nThe groove spacing is $d = 1/N = 1/(75\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1})$.\n$$d = \\frac{1}{75}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\frac{1000}{75}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 13.33\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nWith $m=1$ and $\\lambda_0 = 5.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$\\sin\\beta_0 = \\frac{1 \\times 5.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{2 \\times (1000/75)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{5.00 \\times 75}{2000} = \\frac{375}{2000} = 0.1875$$\nThe corresponding cosine is $\\cos\\beta_0 = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\beta_0} = \\sqrt{1 - (0.1875)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.03515625} = \\sqrt{0.96484375} \\approx 0.98226$.\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the reciprocal linear dispersion. The problem asks for units of $\\mathrm{mm}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We use $f=500\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $d=(1000/75)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\left.\\frac{dx}{d\\lambda}\\right|_{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{f m}{d \\cos\\beta_0} = \\frac{(500\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\times 1}{(1000/75\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\times \\sqrt{0.96484375}} = \\frac{500 \\times 75}{1000 \\times 0.98226}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mm}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 38.175\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mm}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe linear dispersion is the inverse: $d\\lambda/dx \\approx 1/38.175 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n### Part 3: Wavenumber Resolution\n\nThe spectral FWHM in wavelength, $\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$, is obtained by mapping the spatial FWHM, $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$, through the linear dispersion:\n$$\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} \\approx \\left|\\frac{d\\lambda}{dx}\\right|_{\\lambda_0} \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$$\nUsing the results from Part 1 and Part 2:\n$$\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = w = 80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.080\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} \\approx \\frac{1}{38.175\\,\\mathrm{mm}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\times 0.080\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 0.0020956\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nNext, we map this to the wavenumber domain. The wavenumber is $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1/\\lambda$. The problem specifies to use $\\lambda$ in $\\mathrm{cm}$ for this definition.\nThe relation between the spectral bandwidths is $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx |\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{d\\lambda}| \\Delta\\lambda$.\n$$\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{d\\lambda} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\implies \\left|\\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{d\\lambda}\\right|_{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_0^2}$$\nSo the wavenumber resolution is $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}}{\\lambda_0^2}$.\n\nTo calculate the final numerical value, we can assemble a single expression for $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$:\n$$\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\lambda_0^2} \\Delta\\lambda_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_0^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{dx/d\\lambda}\\right) \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_0^2} \\frac{d\\cos\\beta_0}{fm} w$$\nLet's use consistent units (cm) for the calculation, as the final result for $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$ is required in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$\\lambda_0 = 5.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.

It is based on the fundamental principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy and digital signal processing, specifically the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. All necessary data are provided, the terminology is precise, and the question is formally solvable. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the sampling of a signal in one domain (the interferogram as a function of optical path difference, OPD) and the resulting representation in the conjugate domain (the spectrum as a function of wavenumber).\n\nIn Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, the instrument measures an interferogram, $I(x)$, as a function of the OPD, $x$. For a monochromatic light source of wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$, the interferogram is a cosine wave:\n$$\nI(x) = C(\\tilde{\\nu}_0) \\cos(2\\pi \\tilde{\\nu}_0 x)\n$$\nwhere $C(\\tilde{\\nu}_0)$ is a term related to the source intensity and detector response at that wavenumber.

This produces a discrete sequence of data points, $I(n\\Delta)$.\n\nThe Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem dictates the conditions required to faithfully reconstruct a continuous signal from its discrete samples. In the context of FTIR, the \"frequency\" of the signal in the OPD domain is the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$. To avoid loss of information and ambiguity, the sampling rate (in the OPD domain) must be at least twice the highest wavenumber present in the signal. The sampling rate is $1/\\Delta$. Therefore, to unambiguously measure a spectrum up to a maximum wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_{max}$, the condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Delta} > 2\\tilde{\\nu}_{max}\n$$\nThis defines the maximum wavenumber that can be correctly measured for a given sampling step $\\Delta$ without aliasing.
