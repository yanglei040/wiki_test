The problem is well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded. It is a standard application of group theory to molecular vibrations. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\nThe solution requires determining the irreducible representations for the stretching and bending modes of methane and then applying the given selection rules for IR and Raman activity.\n\n**1. Determine the Symmetries of all Vibrational Modes**\nFirst, we find the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, for the $3N=15$ Cartesian displacement coordinates of the $5$ atoms. The character, $\\chi_{3N}(R)$, for each symmetry operation $R$ is the product of the number of atoms unshifted by the operation, $N_R$, and the character of the transformation of the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates, $\\chi_{\\text{coord}}(R)$. The character table for $T_d$ is required. The operations are $E$, $8C_3$, $3C_2$, $6S_4$, and $6\\sigma_d$. The order of the group is $h=24$.\n\n- $E$: All $5$ atoms are unshifted ($N_E=5$). $\\chi_{\\text{coord}}(E)=3$. So, $\\chi_{3N}(E) = 5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n- $C_3$: The central Carbon atom and one Hydrogen atom lie on the axis ($N_{C_3}=2$). $\\chi_{\\text{coord}}(C_3) = 1+2\\cos(2\\pi/3)=0$. So, $\\chi_{3N}(C_3) = 2 \\times 0 = 0$.\n- $C_2$: Only the central Carbon atom is unshifted ($N_{C_2}=1$). $\\chi_{\\text{coord}}(C_2) = 1+2\\cos(\\pi)=-1$. So, $\\chi_{3N}(C_2) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n- $S_4$: Only the central Carbon atom is unshifted ($N_{S_4}=1$). $\\chi_{\\text{coord}}(S_4) = -1+2\\cos(\\pi/2)=-1$. So, $\\chi_{3N}(S_4) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n- $\\sigma_d$: The central Carbon atom and two Hydrogen atoms lie on the plane ($N_{\\sigma_d}=3$). $\\chi_{\\text{coord}}(\\sigma_d)=1$. So, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_d) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\nThis gives the reducible representation for all motions:\n$$ \\Gamma_{3N} = (15, 0, -1, -1, 3) $$\nUsing the reduction formula $n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_R g(R) \\chi_i^*(R) \\chi_{\\text{red}}(R)$, we decompose $\\Gamma_{3N}$ into irreps of $T_d$:\n- $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(1)(15) + 8(1)(0) + 3(1)(-1) + 6(1)(-1) + 6(1)(3)] = \\frac{1}{24}[15-3-6+18] = \\frac{24}{24}=1$\n- $n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(1)(15) + 8(1)(0) + 3(1)(-1) + 6(-1)(-1) + 6(-1)(3)] = \\frac{1}{24}[15-3+6-18] = 0$\n- $n_E = \\frac{1}{24}[1(2)(15) + 8(-1)(0) + 3(2)(-1) + 6(0)(-1) + 6(0)(3)] = \\frac{1}{24}[30-6] = \\frac{24}{24}=1$\n- $n_{T_1} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(3)(15) + 8(0)(0) + 3(-1)(-1) + 6(1)(-1) + 6(-1)(3)] = \\frac{1}{24}[45+3-6-18] = \\frac{24}{24}=1$\n- $n_{T_2} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(3)(15) + 8(0)(0) + 3(-1)(-1) + 6(-1)(-1) + 6(1)(3)] = \\frac{1}{24}[45+3+6+18] = \\frac{72}{24}=3$\nSo, $\\Gamma_{3N} = A_1 \\oplus E \\oplus T_1 \\oplus 3T_2$.\n\nThe total vibrational modes, $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$, are found by subtracting translational and rotational modes. In $T_d$, translations transform as $(x,y,z)$, which is $T_2$. Rotations transform as $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$, which is $T_1$.\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = \\Gamma_{3N} - \\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} - \\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} = (A_1 \\oplus E \\oplus T_1 \\oplus 3T_2) - T_2 - T_1 = A_1 \\oplus E \\oplus 2T_2 $$\nThe total number of vibrational modes is $1 (A_1) + 2 (E) + 2 \\times 3 (T_2) = 1+2+6=9$, which correctly matches $3N-6$.\n\n**2. Determine the Symmetries of the Stretching Modes**\nWe construct a reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$, using the four $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bonds as a basis. The character is the number of bonds unshifted by each symmetry operation.\n- $E$: $4$ bonds unshifted. $\\chi(E)=4$.\n- $C_3$: $1$ bond is on the axis, unshifted. $\\chi(C_3)=1$.\n- $C_2$: $0$ bonds are unshifted. $\\chi(C_2)=0$.\n- $S_4$: $0$ bonds are unshifted. $\\chi(S_4)=0$.\n- $\\sigma_d$: $2$ bonds are in the plane, unshifted. $\\chi(\\sigma_d)=2$.\nSo, $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}} = (4, 1, 0, 0, 2)$.\nReducing this representation:\n- $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(1)(4) + 8(1)(1) + 6(1)(2)] = \\frac{1}{24}[4+8+12] = 1$\n- $n_{T_2} = \\frac{1}{24}[1(3)(4) + 8(0)(1) + 3(-1)(0) + 6(-1)(0) + 6(1)(2)] = \\frac{1}{24}[12+12] = 1$\nThe other irreps have zero coefficients. Thus, the stretching modes have symmetries:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}} = A_1 \\oplus T_2 $$\nThis accounts for $1+3=4$ vibrational modes.\n\n**3. Determine the Symmetries of the Bending Modes**\nThe bending modes, $\\Gamma_{\\text{bend}}$, are the remaining vibrational modes:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{bend}} = \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} - \\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}} = (A_1 \\oplus E \\oplus 2T_2) - (A_1 \\oplus T_2) = E \\oplus T_2 $$\nThis accounts for $2+3=5$ vibrational modes. This is consistent, as the number of internal coordinates is $4$ stretches and $6$ bends, totaling $10$. There should be one redundant coordinate among these $10$, which is found to be one of the bending combinations. The total number of genuine vibrations is $9$.\n\n**4. Determine Spectroscopic Activities**\n- IR Active: Modes with $T_2$ symmetry.\n- Raman Active: Modes with $A_1$, $E$, or $T_2$ symmetry.\n\n- **Stretching Modes ($\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}} = A_1 \\oplus T_2$)**:\n    - $A_1$: Singly degenerate (degeneracy $1$). It is not $T_2$, so it is IR inactive. It is $A_1$, so it is Raman active. Verdict: `Raman only`.\n    - $T_2$: Triply degenerate (degeneracy $3$). It is $T_2$, so it is IR active. It is $T_2$, so it is Raman active. Verdict: `IR and Raman`.\n\n- **Bending Modes ($\\Gamma_{\\text{bend}} = E \\oplus T_2$)**:\n    - $E$: Doubly degenerate (degeneracy $2$). It is not $T_2$, so it is IR inactive. It is $E$, so it is Raman active. Verdict: `Raman only`.\n    - $T_2$: Triply degenerate (degeneracy $3$). It is $T_2$, so it is IR active. It is $T_2$, so it is Raman active. Verdict: `IR and Raman`.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- Stretching: $A_1$ (degeneracy $1$, Raman only) and $T_2$ (degeneracy $3$, IR and Raman).\n- Bending: $E$ (degeneracy $2$, Raman only) and $T_2$ (degeneracy $3$, IR and Raman).\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A) Stretching: $A_1$ ($1$, Raman only) $+$ $T_2$ ($3$, IR and Raman); Bending: $E$ ($2$, Raman only) $+$ $T_2$ ($3$, IR and Raman).**\n  - This option perfectly matches the derived results for both stretching and bending modes, including their symmetries, degeneracies, and spectroscopic activities.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B) Stretching: $A_1$ ($1$, IR and Raman) $+$ $T_2$ ($3$, IR only); Bending: $E$ ($2$, IR and Raman) $+$ $T_2$ ($3$, IR only).**\n  - This option incorrectly assigns activity to every single mode. $A_1$ is Raman only. $T_2$ modes are both IR and Raman active. $E$ is Raman only.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C) Stretching: $E$ ($2$, Raman only) $+$ $T_2$ ($3$, IR and Raman); Bending: $A_1$ ($1$, IR only) $+$ $T_1$ ($3$, Raman only).**\n  - This option incorrectly identifies the symmetries of both stretching and bending modes. The stretching modes are $A_1 \\oplus T_2$, not $E \\oplus T_2$. The bending modes are $E \\oplus T_2$, not $A_1 \\oplus T_1$.

It incorrectly states the $E$ bending mode is IR only (it is Raman only).

For a localized bond stretch, the normal coordinate closely resembles the internuclear separation, and the effective mass is well approximated by the diatomic reduced mass, making the isotope dependence largely controlled by $\\mu$. In contrast, bending modes correspond to changes in bond angles and out-of-plane motions and can be viewed as angular displacements with kinetic energy governed by effective moments of inertia of the vibrating framework. The mass distribution enters through the mass-weighted coordinates and the geometry: isotopic substitution on oxygen alters the center of mass and the moment of inertia of the group, but the bending normal mode is typically more delocalized over several atoms (e.g., carbon and adjacent substituents) and the oxygen’s displacement amplitude in that mode may be smaller than in the pure stretch. Consequently, the effective mass (or inertia) associated with the bending coordinate changes less, and the frequency shift is different in magnitude (often smaller) and can vary between in-plane and out-of-plane bends due to different mass participation and force constants. Thus, while stretching frequencies scale primarily with the diatomic reduced mass, bending frequencies reflect a composite of masses and geometry encoded in the mass-weighted Hessian, leading to different isotopic shift behavior.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{41.43}$$", "id": "3713707"}, {"introduction": "Vibrational frequencies are exquisite probes of a molecule's local environment, shifting in response to intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding.

Consider an amide whose N–H group forms a hydrogen bond to a carbonyl oxygen so that the local electric field is predominantly oriented along the N–H bond axis. Use the following fundamental bases:\n\n- The frequency of a normal mode is determined by the curvature of the potential energy along its normal coordinate, with angular frequency given by $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/\\mu}$, where $k$ is the second derivative of the potential energy with respect to the normal coordinate $Q$ at equilibrium and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass.\n- The Infrared (IR) intensity for a normal mode scales with the square of the dipole moment derivative with respect to its normal coordinate, $I \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q}\\right)^{2}$.\n- In the presence of an external or local electric field $\\mathbf{F}$ (arising here from the hydrogen bond), the potential energy along a normal coordinate $Q$ may be written as $V(Q) = V_{0}(Q) - \\mu(Q) \\cdot \\mathbf{F} + \\ldots$, where $\\mu(Q)$ is the molecular dipole moment projected onto the field direction and the ellipsis indicates higher-order field–matter coupling terms.\n\nAssume two distinct normal coordinates for the amide: $Q_{s}$ for the N–H stretch and $Q_{b}$ for the in-plane N–H bend. The hydrogen bond is such that $\\mathbf{F}$ is primarily collinear with the N–H bond. Without invoking any shortcut formulas, reason from the above bases to determine which statement best explains why the N–H bending mode shifts less upon hydrogen bonding than the N–H stretching mode, and justify the role of dipole moment derivatives in this explanation.\n\nChoose the best answer:\n\nA. Hydrogen bonding produces a largely collinear electric field with the N–H bond that strongly perturbs the potential along $Q_{s}$, because the dipole moment expansion $\\mu(Q_{s}) = \\mu_{0} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q_{s}}\\right)Q_{s} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\mu}{\\partial Q_{s}^{2}}\\right)Q_{s}^{2} + \\ldots$ has large first and second derivatives along the bond axis. The $-\\mu(Q_{s}) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$ term reduces the effective curvature (force constant $k_{s}$) substantially, leading to a pronounced shift of $\\omega_{s}$. For the bend, the coordinate $Q_{b}$ is largely orthogonal to the field so $\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q_{b}}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\mu}{\\partial Q_{b}^{2}}\\right)$ are small, leaving $k_{b}$ nearly unchanged and yielding a minor frequency shift. The small projection of dipole derivatives onto $Q_{b}$ also means weak electrical coupling, consistent with the small observed shift.\n\nB. The bending mode shifts less because its reduced mass $\\mu_{b}$ increases upon hydrogen bonding, whereas the stretching reduced mass $\\mu_{s}$ remains the same; since $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/\\mu}$, the increased $\\mu_{b}$ keeps $\\omega_{b}$ closer to its original value while $\\omega_{s}$ changes more.\n\nC. Hydrogen bonding rigidly enforces planarity, causing $\\left(\\partial \\mu/\\partial Q_{b}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$, which removes IR activity and thereby eliminates any significant change in the bending frequency, while the stretching mode remains IR-active and shifts.\n\nD. The large shift of the N–H stretch arises predominantly from Fermi resonance with overtones and combination bands enhanced by hydrogen bonding, whereas the bending mode is not involved in such resonances and therefore does not shift appreciably.\n\nE. Hydrogen bonding strengthens the N–H bond so that the stretching force constant $k_{s}$ increases and the stretching frequency rises, while bending is unaffected because angles are not directly altered by the hydrogen bond; the stronger stretch response explains the relative lack of bending shift.", "solution": "The problem requires an explanation for the differential frequency shift of N-H stretching and bending vibrations upon hydrogen bonding, based on a specific physical model.

For a more accurate picture that accounts for frequency shifts, we must consider the change in the curvature of the *total* potential, $V(Q)$.\n\nThe effective force constant, $k_{eff}$, is the second derivative of the total potential energy with respect to the normal coordinate, evaluated at the new equilibrium position.\n$$k_{eff} = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial Q^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 V_0}{\\partial Q^2} - \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial Q^2} (\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) \\cdot \\mathbf{F})$$\n\nLet's expand the dipole moment $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q)$ as a Taylor series about the equilibrium position $Q=0$:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_0 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q}\\right)_{0} Q + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q^2}\\right)_{0} Q^2 + \\dots$$\nThe term $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$ becomes:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) \\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{F} + \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q}\\right)_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\right) Q + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q^2}\\right)_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\right) Q^2$$\n\nThe second derivative of this interaction term with respect to $Q$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial Q^2} (\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q^2}\\right)_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$$\n\nThus, the change in the force constant, $\\Delta k = k_{eff} - k_0$, is dominated by the electrical anharmonicity term:\n$$\\Delta k \\approx - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q^2}\\right)_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$$\n(A more complete treatment also includes a term related to the first dipole derivative and the mechanical anharmonicity, but this electrical anharmonicity term is often a principal contributor and illustrates the core physics). The magnitude of the frequency shift depends on the magnitude of $\\Delta k$.\n\nLet us now apply this to the two modes, stretch ($Q_s$) and bend ($Q_b$).\n\n**N-H Stretching Mode ($Q_s$)**:\n- The motion is along the N-H bond axis.\n- The electric field $\\mathbf{F}$ is also along this axis.\n- The dipole moment of the polar N-H bond changes significantly as the bond length changes. Therefore, both the first derivative, $\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}/\\partial Q_s$, and the second derivative (electrical anharmonicity), $\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{\\mu}/\\partial Q_s^2$, are large and directed along the bond axis.\n- Consequently, the dot product $\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q_s^2}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$ is large. This leads to a significant change in the force constant, $\\Delta k_s$. A larger $\\Delta k_s$ causes a larger shift in the frequency $\\omega_s$.\n- The observed redshift (decrease in $\\omega_s$) implies that $k_s$ decreases. This means the overall perturbation makes the potential well shallower. The term $-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q_s) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$ adds to the potential $V_0(Q_s)$, and because stretching the bond increases the dipole component along the field, this interaction lowers the energy on the stretched side of the potential ($Q_s > 0$), effectively reducing the curvature ($k_s$).\n\n**N-H Bending Mode ($Q_b$)**:\n- The motion is in-plane, but largely perpendicular to the N-H bond axis.\n- The electric field $\\mathbf{F}$ is along the N-H bond axis, i.e., orthogonal to the principal direction of motion for the bend.\n- When the H atom moves perpendicularly to the bond axis, the change in the dipole moment component *along* the bond axis is very small. By symmetry, for a small displacement $Q_b$, the component of $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ along $\\mathbf{F}$ changes quadratically, meaning $(\\partial \\mu_{||}/\\partial Q_b)_0 = 0$. The change in dipole moment, $\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}/\\partial Q_b$, is primarily directed perpendicular to the bond axis.\n- Therefore, the dot products involving the field, such as $\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q_b}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$ and $\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q_b^2}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$, will be very small. This is because the vectors representing the dipole derivatives are nearly orthogonal to the electric field vector $\\mathbf{F}$.\n- As a result, the change in the force constant, $\\Delta k_b$, is minimal. A very small $\\Delta k_b$ leads to a negligible shift in the bending frequency $\\omega_b$.\n\nIn summary, the large frequency shift of the N-H stretch and the small shift of the N-H bend are explained by the alignment of the stretching motion with the electric field versus the orthogonality of the bending motion. This geometric difference controls the magnitude of the interaction term $-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$ and its effect on the potential's curvature ($k$), which is mediated by the dipole moment derivatives.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Hydrogen bonding produces a largely collinear electric field with the N–H bond that strongly perturbs the potential along $Q_{s}$, because the dipole moment expansion $\\mu(Q_{s}) = \\mu_{0} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q_{s}}\\right)Q_{s} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\mu}{\\partial Q_{s}^{2}}\\right)Q_{s}^{2} + \\ldots$ has large first and second derivatives along the bond axis. The $-\\mu(Q_{s}) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$ term reduces the effective curvature (force constant $k_{s}$) substantially, leading to a pronounced shift of $\\omega_{s}$. For the bend, the coordinate $Q_{b}$ is largely orthogonal to the field so $\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q_{b}}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\mu}{\\partial Q_{b}^{2}}\\right)$ are small, leaving $k_{b}$ nearly unchanged and yielding a minor frequency shift. The small projection of dipole derivatives onto $Q_{b}$ also means weak electrical coupling, consistent with the small observed shift.**\n- This option correctly identifies the alignment of $\\mathbf{F}$ with $Q_s$ and the near-orthogonality with $Q_b$. It correctly invokes the potential energy perturbation $-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$ and identifies the dipole derivatives as the key quantities mediating the effect on the force constant. It correctly concludes that the perturbation to $k_s$ is large and the perturbation to $k_b$ is small based on this geometric argument. The reasoning is fully consistent with the derivation from the provided bases.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The bending mode shifts less because its reduced mass $\\mu_{b}$ increases upon hydrogen bonding, whereas the stretching reduced mass $\\mu_{s}$ remains the same; since $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/\\mu}$, the increased $\\mu_{b}$ keeps $\\omega_{b}$ closer to its original value while $\\omega_{s}$ changes more.**\n- This option incorrectly attributes the frequency shift to a change in reduced mass. The reduced masses are determined by the masses of the constituent atoms (N and H), which are not altered by the intermolecular hydrogen bond. The provided physical model (Basis 3) clearly points to a change in the potential energy ($V$) and thus the force constant ($k$), not the reduced mass ($\\mu$).\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Hydrogen bonding rigidly enforces planarity, causing $\\left(\\partial \\mu/\\partial Q_{b}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$, which removes IR activity and thereby eliminates any significant change in the bending frequency, while the stretching mode remains IR-active and shifts.**\n- This option incorrectly conflates IR intensity with frequency stability. Basis 2 links $(\\partial \\mu/\\partial Q)$ to intensity, while Basis 1 and 3 link frequency shifts to changes in the force constant $k$. A mode can have zero IR intensity but still experience a frequency shift if its potential curvature is perturbed. Furthermore, H-bonding typically *increases* the IR intensity of X-H bending modes, it does not make them inactive.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The large shift of the N–H stretch arises predominantly from Fermi resonance with overtones and combination bands enhanced by hydrogen bonding, whereas the bending mode is not involved in such resonances and therefore does not shift appreciably.**\n- While Fermi resonance can be a contributing factor to the appearance of N-H stretching bands, the problem explicitly asks for a justification based on the provided physical model ($V(Q) = V_0(Q) - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$, etc.). This model describes the direct electrostatic effect on the fundamental vibration. Fermi resonance is a mode-coupling phenomenon not described by or derivable from the given bases. This option introduces an external explanation.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Hydrogen bonding strengthens the N–H bond so that the stretching force constant $k_{s}$ increases and the stretching frequency rises, while bending is unaffected because angles are not directly altered by the hydrogen bond; the stronger stretch response explains the relative lack of bending shift.**\n- This option makes a factually incorrect assertion. Hydrogen bonding *weakens* the covalent N-H bond, which leads to a *decrease* in the force constant $k_s$ and a *decrease* in the stretching frequency (a redshift). The problem statement explicitly mentions that the band \"redshifts substantially\", which contradicts this option's claim that the frequency rises.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3713737"}]}
