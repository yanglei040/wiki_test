This leads to the well-known high-temperature approximation for the fractional population difference:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta N}{N_{total}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta E}{2k_B T}$$\n\nThe energy splitting $\\Delta E$ is slightly different for each chemically non-equivalent proton due to chemical shielding, $\\sigma$. The effective magnetic field experienced by a nucleus is $B_{eff} = B_0(1-\\sigma)$, so $\\Delta E_i = \\hbar\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}}B_0(1-\\sigma_i)$ for group $i$. However, for protons, $\\sigma_i$ is on the order of parts per million ($10^{-6}$), so the factor $(1-\\sigma_i)$ is extremely close to $1$ for all proton resonances. Consequently, the energy splitting $\\Delta E_i$ and thus the fractional population difference $\\frac{\\Delta N_i}{N_{total, i}}$ are virtually identical for all three proton groups in ethanol.\nLet this approximately constant fractional population difference be $\\delta_p \\approx \\frac{\\hbar\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}} B_0}{2 k_B T}$.\n\nThe problem states that the integrated signal intensity, $I_i$, for a resonance from environment $i$ is proportional to the net equilibrium population difference for the spins in that environment multiplied by the number of equivalent spins, $n_i$. The net population difference for the group is the total number of spins in that group, $n_i$, multiplied by the fractional population difference per spin, $\\delta_p$. Thus, the total signal for group $i$ is:\n$$I_i \\propto (\\text{total pop. diff. for group } i) = n_i \\times \\delta_p$$\nSince $\\delta_p$ is a constant of proportionality that is the same for all proton groups under these experimental conditions, the intensity is directly proportional to the number of equivalent protons:\n$$I_i \\propto n_i$$\n\nFor ethanol ($\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$), the numbers of equivalent protons for the three groups are:\n- Methyl ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$): $n_{\\mathrm{CH_3}} = 3$\n- Methylene ($\\mathrm{CH_2}$): $n_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} = 2$\n- Hydroxyl ($\\mathrm{OH}$): $n_{\\mathrm{OH}} = 1$\n\nTherefore, the relative integrated intensities are in the ratio:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{CH_3}} : I_{\\mathrm{CH_2}} : I_{\\mathrm{OH}} = 3 : 2 : 1$$\n\nTo find the normalized row vector, we sum the parts of the ratio: $3 + 2 + 1 = 6$. We then divide each part by this total sum to find the fractional contribution of each resonance to the total intensity:\n- Normalized intensity for $\\mathrm{CH_3}$: $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Normalized intensity for $\\mathrm{CH_2}$: $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- Normalized intensity for $\\mathrm{OH}$: $\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThe final answer is a row vector of these normalized values. Assuming the order presented in the problem ($\\mathrm{CH_3}$, $\\mathrm{CH_2}$, $\\mathrm{OH}$), the vector is $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{6})$.\n\nRegarding the breakdown of the assumptions:\n1.  The assumption of sufficiently long relaxation delays ensures that all spin populations return to their Boltzmann equilibrium before each pulse. This assumption would break down if the repetition time between successive pulses is short relative to the spin-lattice relaxation times ($T_1$) of the different proton groups. Since $T_1$ values often vary with the chemical environment (e.g., due to molecular motion, proximity to paramagnetic species), some resonances may become saturated (i.e., their population difference is diminished) more than others. This would lead to integrated intensities that no longer accurately reflect the ratio of the number of protons.\n2.  The assumption of a simple Boltzmann population distribution holds for basic one-pulse experiments. This assumption breaks down in many advanced NMR experiments that use complex pulse sequences to manipulate spin populations. For instance, polarization transfer experiments like INEPT or DEPT intentionally create non-Boltzmann populations to enhance the signals of less sensitive nuclei. Furthermore, the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) involves the transfer of spin polarization through space between dipolar-coupled nuclei, altering their populations from the simple thermal equilibrium state and causing intensity changes that depend on internuclear distances rather than just proton count.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3724932"}, {"introduction": "A key assumption in using signal integration to count nuclei is that the fractional population difference is effectively the same for all protons, regardless of their chemical environment.

The chemical shift, $\\delta$, quantifies this dependence relative to a reference frequency, $\\nu_{ref}$. It is defined as:\n$$ \\delta~\\text{[ppm]} = \\frac{\\nu - \\nu_{ref}}{\\nu_{ref}} \\times 10^6 $$\nFrom this, the frequency $\\nu$ for a given site can be expressed as:\n$$ \\nu = \\nu_{ref}\\left(1 + \\delta \\times 10^{-6}\\right) $$\nIn this problem, site $A$ is the reference, so $\\delta_A = 0~\\mathrm{ppm}$ and its frequency is $\\nu_A = \\nu_{ref} = 600 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nFor site $B$, the chemical shift is $\\delta_B = 7.50~\\mathrm{ppm}$. Its frequency, $\\nu_B$, is therefore:\n$$ \\nu_B = \\nu_A\\left(1 + \\delta_B \\times 10^{-6}\\right) $$\n\nStep 5: Calculating the Fractional Change\nWe need to compute the fractional change in the normalized population difference at site $B$ relative to site $A$:\n$$ \\frac{D_B - D_A}{D_A} $$\nUsing the approximation $D \\approx \\frac{h\\nu}{2k_B T}$ for both sites:\n$$ D_A \\approx \\frac{h\\nu_A}{2k_B T} $$\n$$ D_B \\approx \\frac{h\\nu_B}{2k_B T} $$\nSubstituting these into the fractional change expression:\n$$ \\frac{D_B - D_A}{D_A} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{h\\nu_B}{2k_B T} - \\frac{h\\nu_A}{2k_B T}}{\\frac{h\\nu_A}{2k_B T}} $$\nThe constant factor $\\frac{h}{2k_B T}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{D_B - D_A}{D_A} = \\frac{\\nu_B - \\nu_A}{\\nu_A} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\nu_B$ in terms of $\\nu_A$ and $\\delta_B$:\n$$ \\frac{D_B - D_A}{D_A} = \\frac{\\nu_A\\left(1 + \\delta_B \\times 10^{-6}\\right) - \\nu_A}{\\nu_A} = \\frac{\\nu_A\\left(1 + \\delta_B \\times 10^{-6} - 1\\right)}{\\nu_A} $$\n$$ \\frac{D_B - D_A}{D_A} = \\delta_B \\times 10^{-6} $$\nThis remarkably simple result shows that the fractional change in the normalized population difference is numerically equal to the chemical shift expressed as a simple fraction (not in ppm).\n\nStep 6: Final Numerical Calculation\nThe given chemical shift for site $B$ is $\\delta_B = 7.50~\\mathrm{ppm}$.\n$$ \\frac{D_B - D_A}{D_A} = 7.50 \\times 10^{-6} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a dimensionless decimal number, rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $7.50 \\times 10^{-6}$, which has three significant figures. To express this with four significant figures as instructed, we append a zero.\nIn decimal form, this is $0.000007500$.\nThe leading zeros are not significant, so the significant figures are $7, 5, 0, 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.000007500}$$", "id": "3725029"}]}
