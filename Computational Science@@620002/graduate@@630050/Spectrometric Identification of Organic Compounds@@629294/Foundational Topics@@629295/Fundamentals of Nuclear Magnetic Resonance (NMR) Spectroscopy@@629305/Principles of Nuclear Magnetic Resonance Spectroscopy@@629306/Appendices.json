This is expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\nu - \\nu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6\n$$\nThe quantity $\\nu - \\nu_{\\text{ref}}$ is the absolute frequency offset, denoted as $\\Delta \\nu$. The units of $\\delta$ are parts per million (ppm). The frequencies $\\nu$, $\\nu_{\\text{ref}}$, and $\\nu_0$ must have consistent units. Conventionally, $\\Delta \\nu$ is given in Hertz ($\\text{Hz}$) and $\\nu_0$ is given in Megahertz ($\\text{MHz}$).\n\nTo find the absolute frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu$ in $\\text{Hz}$, we rearrange the definition:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu = \\delta \\times \\nu_0 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nTo ensure correct unit conversion, let $\\nu_0$ be expressed in $\\text{Hz}$. Since $1\\,\\text{MHz} = 10^6\\,\\text{Hz}$, the spectrometer frequency in $\\text{Hz}$ is $\\nu_0 \\text{ [MHz]} \\times 10^6 \\text{ Hz/MHz}$.

Since the given chemical shift $\\delta = 7.26$ is positive, our calculated frequency offsets are correctly positive, indicating that the proton resonance is downfield (at a higher frequency) from the TMS reference.\n\nJustification of scaling and reconciliation with the $\\delta$ axis:\nThe relationship $\\Delta \\nu = \\delta \\times \\nu_0 \\times 10^{-6}$ demonstrates that for a nucleus with a constant chemical shift $\\delta$, the absolute frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu$ is directly proportional to the spectrometer's observation frequency $\\nu_0$. This physical phenomenon is fundamental to NMR. The observed frequency shift arises from the shielding of the nucleus by its local electronic environment, which slightly modifies the magnetic field experienced by the nucleus. This modification is proportional to the strength of the external applied magnetic field, $B_0$. Since the spectrometer's operating frequency is also directly proportional to the magnetic field strength ($\\nu_0 \\propto B_0$, from the Larmor equation), the absolute frequency offset $\\Delta \\nu$ is consequently proportional to $\\nu_0$. Thus, operating at a higher field (and higher $\\nu_0$) increases the frequency separation in $\\text{Hz}$ between different resonances, leading to better spectral dispersion and resolution.\n\nThe conventional chemical shift axis in ppm ($\\delta$) is designed to be independent of the magnetic field strength. By defining $\\delta$ as the ratio of the frequency offset to the spectrometer frequency, $\\delta = (\\Delta \\nu / \\nu_0) \\times 10^6$, the dependence on $\\nu_0$ is canceled out. As shown, since $\\Delta \\nu$ is proportional to $\\nu_0$, the ratio $\\Delta \\nu / \\nu_0$ remains constant for a given proton across spectrometers of different field strengths. This normalization allows for the creation of standardized libraries of chemical shifts and enables direct comparison of spectra acquired on different instruments. The use of the $\\delta$ scale renders spectral data independent of the specific hardware used for its acquisition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2904 & 4356 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3724310"}, {"introduction": "A proton's chemical shift provides a sensitive report on its local electronic environment, but this environment is not static; it can be profoundly influenced by interactions with the surrounding solvent. This practice explores the powerful effect of hydrogen bonding on proton shielding, a key concept for interpreting spectra recorded in different solvents.

In a poor hydrogen bond accepting, relatively non-polar solvent such as CDCl$_{3}$, the N-H proton of pyrrole experiences less hydrogen bonding, leading to relatively greater local electron density and larger $\\sigma$ (more shielding). In a strong hydrogen bond accepting, highly polar aprotic solvent such as DMSO-d$_{6}$, the oxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond with the N-H proton of pyrrole. Hydrogen bonding withdraws electron density from the N-H bond and from the vicinity of the proton, decreasing $\\sigma$ (deshielding). By the relation above, decreased $\\sigma$ yields increased $\\nu$ and thus an increased $\\delta$, i.e., a downfield shift.\n\nConsidering the answer choices:\n- A downfield shift (higher ppm) follows directly from hydrogen-bond-induced deshielding in DMSO-d$_{6}$ compared to CDCl$_{3}$.\n- An upfield shift is inconsistent with the effect of stronger hydrogen bonding.\n- No significant change is unlikely because the difference in hydrogen bonding strength between CDCl$_{3}$ and DMSO-d$_{6}$ is substantial.\n- Disappearance of the N-H peak would require rapid exchange or chemical transformation; DMSO-d$_{6}$ is not strongly acidic or basic and does not inherently remove the N-H signal.\n- A change from singlet to triplet would require resolved scalar coupling; N-H protons typically undergo exchange that broadens or simplifies coupling, and hydrogen bonding changes position more than multiplicity in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely change is a significant downfield shift when moving from CDCl$_{3}$ to DMSO-d$_{6}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1429853"}, {"introduction": "When two protons are coupled, the resulting signal's appearance depends critically on the ratio of their chemical shift separation in Hertz ($\\Delta\\nu$) to their coupling constant ($J$).
