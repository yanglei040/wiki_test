A complete solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution is presented in four parts as requested: derivation of the aliasing formula, comparison with Continuous Wave (CW) NMR, calculation of the apparent frequency, and discussion of strategies to manage aliasing.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Apparent Frequency in FT-NMR**\n\nThe Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem states that to unambiguously represent a continuous-time signal containing frequencies up to a maximum frequency $f_{\\mathrm{max}}$, the sampling rate $f_s$ must be greater than twice the maximum frequency, i.e., $f_s > 2f_{\\mathrm{max}}$. For complex signals, as is the case in quadrature detection FT-NMR, the spectral width $SW$ is equal to the sampling rate, $SW = f_s$. The frequency range that can be unambiguously represented is $[-SW/2, SW/2]$.\n\nA single resonance with a frequency offset $f_{\\mathrm{off}}$ from the radiofrequency (RF) carrier is described by the continuous-time signal $s(t) = A \\exp(i 2 \\pi f_{\\mathrm{off}} t)$. The spectrometer samples this signal at discrete time intervals $t_n = n \\Delta t$, where $n$ is an integer representing the sample index and $\\Delta t$ is the dwell time. The discrete-time signal is:\n$$s[n] = s(t_n) = A \\exp(i 2 \\pi f_{\\mathrm{off}} n \\Delta t)$$\nThe spectral width $SW$ is defined as the reciprocal of the dwell time, $SW = 1/\\Delta t$. Substituting $\\Delta t = 1/SW$ into the expression for $s[n]$ gives:\n$$s[n] = A \\exp\\left(i 2 \\pi n \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{off}}}{SW}\\right)$$\nThe discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of this signal will yield a spectrum. The DFT is inherently periodic in the frequency domain with a period equal to the sampling rate $SW$. This means that a frequency $f$ is indistinguishable from any frequency $f'$ such that $f' = f + k \\cdot SW$ for any integer $k$. To demonstrate this, consider a frequency $f_{\\mathrm{app}}$ related to $f_{\\mathrm{off}}$ by $f_{\\mathrm{off}} = f_{\\mathrm{app}} + k \\cdot SW$ for some integer $k$. The sampled signal corresponding to $f_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is:\n$$s[n] = A \\exp\\left(i 2 \\pi n \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{app}} + k \\cdot SW}{SW}\\right) = A \\exp\\left(i 2 \\pi n \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{app}}}{SW}\\right) \\exp(i 2 \\pi n k)$$\nSince $n$ and $k$ are integers, Euler's identity gives $\\exp(i 2 \\pi n k) = \\cos(2 \\pi n k) + i \\sin(2 \\pi n k) = 1$. Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$s[n] = A \\exp\\left(i 2 \\pi n \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{app}}}{SW}\\right)$$\nThis is identical to the sampled signal that would be obtained from a resonance with frequency offset $f_{\\mathrm{app}}$. Consequently, the spectrometer cannot distinguish between $f_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{app}}$. The processed spectrum maps all frequencies into a principal range of width $SW$, conventionally chosen as $[-SW/2, SW/2]$.\n\nIf the true offset frequency $|f_{\\mathrm{off}}|$ is greater than $SW/2$, it lies outside this principal range. The signal will be \"aliased\" or \"folded\" to an apparent frequency, $f_{\\mathrm{app}}$, within the range. The relationship is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{app}} = f_{\\mathrm{off}} - k \\cdot SW$$\nwhere the integer $k$ is chosen such that $-SW/2 \\le f_{\\mathrm{app}} \\le SW/2$. This integer $k$ is the one that minimizes $|f_{\\mathrm{off}} - k \\cdot SW|$, which can be calculated as $k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{off}}}{SW} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor$, where $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ is the floor function. This formula provides the apparent frequency for any resonance, including those that are aliased ($k \\neq 0$).\n\n**Part 2: Comparison with Continuous Wave (CW) NMR**\n\nContinuous Wave (CW) NMR spectrometers operate on a fundamentally different principle that does not involve digital sampling of a wideband time-domain signal. In a CW experiment, either the magnetic field $B_0$ is held constant while the RF frequency is swept through a range, or the RF frequency is held constant while the magnetic field is swept. At any given moment, the instrument only excites and detects resonances within a very narrow frequency band centered on the instantaneous excitation frequency. A signal whose resonance frequency is far from the current excitation frequency is not excited and therefore not detected. Because the spectrum is acquired sequentially, point by point in the frequency domain, there is no simultaneous acquisition of information across a wide spectral range and no subsequent digital Fourier transform of a time-domain signal. Therefore, the conditions for the Shannon-Nyquist theorem are not met, and the phenomenon of digital aliasing (folding) does not occur.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Apparent Frequency**\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute frequencies of the transmitter and the resonance with respect to the tetramethylsilane (TMS) reference (at $\\delta = 0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$).

Positive values indicate frequencies higher than the carrier.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{off}} = f_{\\mathrm{res}} - f_{\\mathrm{tx}} = 2538 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} - 1080 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 1458 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe spectral width is given as $SW = 1.60 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 1600 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. The Nyquist frequency range for detection is $[-SW/2, SW/2]$, which is $[-800 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}, 800 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}]$.\n\nSince $|f_{\\mathrm{off}}| = |1458 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}| > 800 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, the peak is aliased.

The calculated value is exactly $-142$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $-142.0$.\n\n**Part 4: Strategies for Detecting, Correcting, and Preventing Folding**\n\nTwo physically motivated strategies to detect and correct folding are:\n\n1.  **Varying the Spectral Width ($SW$)**: A folded peak's apparent position, $f_{\\mathrm{app}} = f_{\\mathrm{off}} - k \\cdot SW$, is a function of $SW$. In contrast, an unfolded peak's apparent position is its true offset, $f_{\\mathrm{app}} = f_{\\mathrm{off}}$, which is independent of $SW$. To detect folding, one can acquire a second spectrum with a different spectral width (e.g., by changing the dwell time $\\Delta t$). Folded peaks will shift their apparent frequency, while unfolded (\"true\") peaks will remain at the same frequency. Once identified, folding can be corrected by increasing $SW$ until it is large enough to contain all signals ($SW > 2|f_{\\mathrm{off,max}}|$).\n\n2.  **Varying the Transmitter Frequency**: The offset frequency is defined relative to the transmitter, $f_{\\mathrm{off}} = f_{\\mathrm{res}} - f_{\\mathrm{carrier}}$. Shifting the transmitter frequency by $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{carrier}}$ changes the offset of every peak by $-\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{carrier}}$. An unfolded peak will simply shift by $-\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{carrier}}$ in the spectrum. A folded peak's apparent position will also change, but its movement can be non-intuitive. For instance, a peak that was folded from the high-frequency side might now be folded from the low-frequency side (or vice versa), or the folding integer $k$ might change, causing it to \"jump\" to a completely different spectral region. By observing which peaks move \"correctly\" and which move \"anomalously\" upon a change in transmitter frequency, one can identify folded signals. Correction involves repositioning the transmitter frequency to the center of the chemical shift range of interest.\n\nThe role that acquisition parameters and transmitter placement play in preventing folding is paramount for the spectrometric identification of organic compounds.\n-   **Transmitter Placement**: The transmitter frequency defines the center of the spectral window ($0 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ offset). It should be strategically placed in the middle of the expected range of chemical shifts for the sample under investigation. For a typical $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ spectrum of an organic molecule (e.g., signals from $0$ to $12 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$), placing the transmitter at $6 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ minimizes the maximum required offset frequency.\n-   **Acquisition Parameters (specifically $SW$)**: The spectral width must be chosen to be large enough to contain all expected signals based on the chosen transmitter position. That is, $SW$ must be greater than twice the largest expected offset frequency: $SW \\ge 2 \\times |f_{\\mathrm{off, max}}|$. For the example above with the transmitter at $6 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and signals up to $12 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$ and down to $0 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$, the maximum offset is $6 \\ \\mathrm{ppm} \\times 600 \\ \\mathrm{Hz/ppm} = 3600 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. The spectral width must therefore be $SW > 2 \\times 3600 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 7200 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $12 \\ \\mathrm{ppm}$). Failure to set a sufficiently large $SW$ (by using too large a dwell time $\\Delta t$) will result in the aliasing of signals that lie outside the defined spectral window, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the spectrum and incorrect structure elucidation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-142.0}$$", "id": "3698081"}]}
