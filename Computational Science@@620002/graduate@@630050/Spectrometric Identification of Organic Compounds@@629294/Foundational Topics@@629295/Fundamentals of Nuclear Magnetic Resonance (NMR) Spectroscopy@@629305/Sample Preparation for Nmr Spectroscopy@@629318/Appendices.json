As established, the conditions are mutually exclusive: resolving coupling requires very slow exchange ($k \\ll 8~\\text{Hz}$), while rapid verification requires fast exchange ($k \\ge 0.2079\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$). A rate cannot be simultaneously much smaller than $8$ and greater than $0.2079$.

It uses standard principles and equations of NMR spectroscopy, such as the Bloch equations for magnetization recovery, the effect of paramagnetic relaxation agents on $T_1$ and $T_2$, and the relationship between $T_2$ and Lorentzian linewidth. The provided values for relaxation times and relaxivities are physically plausible. The problem is well-posed as a constrained optimization problem. The language is objective and precise. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem asks to formalize a physical scenario and solve it mathematically, which is a standard task in a scientific discipline. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to maximize the total signal-to-noise ratio, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{total}}$, over a fixed total experiment time, $T_{\\text{total}}$.\nThe total SNR is given as being proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio of a single scan multiplied by the square root of the number of scans, $N_{\\text{scans}}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{total}} \\propto \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{scan}} \\times \\sqrt{N_{\\text{scans}}}\n$$\nThe signal-to-noise for a single scan, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{scan}}$, is proportional to the signal amplitude per scan, $S$. Let the constant noise level be $N_0$. Then $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{scan}} = S/N_0$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{total}} \\propto S \\times \\sqrt{N_{\\text{scans}}}\n$$\nThe number of scans is the total experiment time divided by the time per scan (the repetition time, $T_R$):\n$$\nN_{\\text{scans}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{total}}}{T_R}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{total}} \\propto S \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{\\text{total}}}{T_R}}\n$$\nSince $T_{\\text{total}}$ is a fixed constant, we need to maximize the quantity $S / \\sqrt{T_R}$.\nThe problem states that the repetition time is fixed: $T_R = t_{\\mathrm{acq}} = 8.192$ s. As $T_R$ is a constant, maximizing $S / \\sqrt{T_R}$ is equivalent to maximizing the signal per scan, $S$.\n\nThe signal per scan, $S$, is proportional to the transverse magnetization immediately following the pulse, which in turn is proportional to the longitudinal magnetization, $M_z$, immediately before the pulse. A $90^\\circ$ pulse is used, which sets the longitudinal magnetization to zero after each pulse. During the subsequent repetition time $T_R$, the magnetization recovers according to the given equation: $M_z(t) = M_0\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-t/T_1\\right)\\right)$.\nThe magnetization immediately before the next pulse at time $t = T_R$ is therefore:\n$$\nM_z(T_R) = M_0\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_R}{T_1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince $S$ is proportional to $M_z(T_R)$, and $M_0$ is a constant, the function to maximize is:\n$$\nf(c) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_R}{T_1(c)}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $T_1$ depends on the dopant concentration, $c$. The relationship is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_1(c)} = \\frac{1}{T_1^0} + r_1 c\n$$\nTo maximize $f(c)$, we analyze its dependence on $c$. As the concentration $c$ increases (for $c \\ge 0$ and $r_1 > 0$), the relaxation rate $1/T_1(c)$ increases. This means the relaxation time $T_1(c)$ decreases. As $T_1(c)$ decreases, the ratio $T_R/T_1(c)$ increases. The term $-\\exp\\left(-T_R/T_1(c)\\right)$ becomes less negative, and thus the entire expression $f(c) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-T_R/T_1(c)\\right)$ increases. Therefore, the signal per scan is a monotonically increasing function of the dopant concentration $c$.\n\nTo maximize this function, we must use the highest possible value of $c$ that still satisfies the experimental constraints. The only constraint is on the spectral resolution, given by the full width at half maximum (FWHM).\nThe constraint is $\\text{FWHM} \\le 1.00~\\text{Hz}$.\nThe FWHM is given by $\\text{FWHM} = 1/(\\pi T_2^*)$. With the assumption $T_2^* = T_2$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\pi T_2} \\le 1.00 \\, \\text{Hz}\n$$\nRearranging the inequality gives a lower bound on $T_2$:\n$$\nT_2 \\ge \\frac{1}{1.00 \\pi \\, \\text{s}^{-1}}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to an upper bound on the transverse relaxation rate $T_2^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_2} \\le \\pi \\, \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe dependence of the transverse relaxation rate on concentration $c$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_2(c)} = \\frac{1}{T_2^0} + r_2 c\n$$\nSubstituting this into the constraint inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_2^0} + r_2 c \\le \\pi\n$$\nWe can now solve for the maximum allowable concentration, $c$.\n$$\nr_2 c \\le \\pi - \\frac{1}{T_2^0}\n$$\n$$\nc \\le \\frac{\\pi - (T_2^0)^{-1}}{r_2}\n$$\nSince the objective function is monotonically increasing with $c$, the optimal concentration $c^{\\ast}$ that maximizes the SNR is the maximum value allowed by the constraint:\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\pi - (T_2^0)^{-1}}{r_2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $T_2^0 = 0.80~\\text{s}$ and $r_2 = 0.30~\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{mM}^{-1}$.\nFirst, calculate the intrinsic transverse relaxation rate:\n$$\n(T_2^0)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{0.80 \\, \\text{s}} = 1.25 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $c^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\pi \\, \\text{s}^{-1} - 1.25 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}}{0.30 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\text{mM}^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the value for $\\pi \\approx 3.14159...$:\n$$\nc^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{3.14159 - 1.25}{0.30} \\, \\text{mM} = \\frac{1.89159}{0.30} \\, \\text{mM} \\approx 6.3053 \\, \\text{mM}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nc^{\\ast} \\approx 6.31 \\, \\text{mM}\n$$\nThe values of $T_R$, $T_1^0$, and $r_1$ were not needed for the final calculation of $c^*$, as the objective function is monotonic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.31}$$", "id": "3722628"}]}
