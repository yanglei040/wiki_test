This phenomenon is known as electronic shielding. The effective magnetic field, $B_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, experienced by the nucleus is thus modulated by a dimensionless shielding factor, $\\sigma$:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eff}} = B_{0} (1 - \\sigma)\n$$\nA larger value of $\\sigma$ corresponds to greater shielding and a weaker effective magnetic field.\n\nThe resonance frequency of the shielded nucleus is therefore a function of $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\nu(\\sigma) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0} (1 - \\sigma)\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of the Change in Resonance Frequency, $\\Delta \\nu$**\n\nWe are asked to find the change in resonance frequency, $\\Delta \\nu$, resulting from a small change in the shielding factor, $\\Delta \\sigma$. We can determine this by considering the derivative of the frequency with respect to the shielding factor.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\sigma} = \\frac{d}{d\\sigma} \\left[ \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0} (1 - \\sigma) \\right] = - \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0}\n$$\nSince the relationship between $\\nu$ and $\\sigma$ is linear, for any finite change $\\Delta \\sigma$, the corresponding change in frequency $\\Delta \\nu$ is given exactly by:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu = \\frac{d\\nu}{d\\sigma} \\Delta \\sigma = - \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0} \\Delta \\sigma\n$$\nThis equation shows that an increase in shielding ($\\Delta \\sigma > 0$) leads to a decrease in resonance frequency ($\\Delta \\nu  0$), which is consistent with the physical principles.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n-   $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} = 42.577\\ \\mathrm{MHz/T} = 42.577 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Hz/T}$\n-   $B_{0} = 9.4\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n-   $\\Delta \\sigma = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThe change in frequency is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu = - (42.577 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Hz/T}) \\times (9.4\\ \\mathrm{T}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-6})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu = - (42.577 \\times 9.4 \\times 2.0) \\times (10^{6} \\times 10^{-6})\\ \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu = - 800.4476\\ \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as instructed, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta \\nu = -800.4\\ \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Corresponding Shift in Parts-Per-Million (ppm)**\n\nThe problem defines the ppm shift as the fractional frequency change relative to the spectrometer resonance frequency, multiplied by $10^{6}$. The spectrometer resonance frequency, which we denote as $\\nu_{spec}$, is the nominal frequency for the given nucleus at field $B_0$, typically corresponding to a reference with $\\sigma \\approx 0$.\n$$\n\\nu_{spec} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0}\n$$\nThe ppm shift, which we can denote as $\\Delta \\delta$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\delta = \\frac{\\Delta \\nu}{\\nu_{spec}} \\times 10^{6}\n$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\Delta \\nu$ and $\\nu_{spec}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\delta = \\frac{- \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0} \\Delta \\sigma}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0}} \\times 10^{6}\n$$\nThe terms $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}$ and $B_0$ cancel, yielding a simple relationship between the ppm shift and the change in shielding:\n$$\n\\Delta \\delta = - \\Delta \\sigma \\times 10^{6}\n$$\nUsing the given value $\\Delta \\sigma = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\delta = - (2.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10^{6} = -2.0\\ \\mathrm{ppm}\n$$\nThe problem requires this answer to be reported to four significant figures. This implies that the given $\\Delta \\sigma$ should be treated as a value with sufficient precision. We therefore write the result as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\delta = -2.000\\ \\mathrm{ppm}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that an increase in shielding ($\\Delta \\sigma > 0$) results in a shift to a lower chemical shift value (a shift \"upfield\").\n\nThe two requested values are the change in frequency $\\Delta \\nu$ in Hz and the ppm shift.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-800.4  -2.000\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3723486"}, {"introduction": "While the first practice established the quantitative link between shielding and frequency, we now explore a key physical origin of shielding differences: magnetic anisotropy.

In NMR, the observed resonance of a nucleus depends on the effective magnetic field $B_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ at the nucleus, which is the sum of the external field $B_0$ and local induced fields due to electronic motion. The observed chemical shift $\\delta$ (referenced to tetramethylsilane, TMS) increases when the nucleus is more deshielded, i.e., when $B_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is larger at the nucleus, and decreases when the nucleus is more shielded, i.e., when $B_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is smaller.\n\nThe magnetic anisotropy of the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ group is an established phenomenon. In the widely accepted model, the region forming a cone along the bond axis is a **shielding zone** (where the induced field opposes $B_0$), while the region in the plane of the group is a **deshielding zone** (where the induced field reinforces $B_0$).

It tests the qualitative understanding of magnetic anisotropy, a key concept in NMR spectroscopy. The initial premise has been corrected to reflect the physically accurate model of carbonyl anisotropy, which is consistent with the main article's content.\n\n### Qualitative Analysis\nThe problem asks for the ordering of chemical shifts ($\\delta$) for three protons (X, Y, Z) placed at different angles ($\\theta$) relative to a carbonyl group's axis, but at the same distance. The chemical shift $\\delta$ is directly related to the effective magnetic field ($B_{\\text{eff}}$): a higher $B_{\\text{eff}}$ (deshielding) leads to a higher $\\delta$, and a lower $B_{\\text{eff}}$ (shielding) leads to a lower $\\delta$.\n\nThe spatial distribution of the shielding/deshielding effect is described by the problem statement and the McConnell equation, which has a geometric dependence of $(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$.\n- **Shielding** occurs when the induced field opposes $B_0$. This happens in a conical region along the C=O axis.\n- **Deshielding** occurs when the induced field reinforces $B_0$. This happens in a planar region around the \"equator\" of the C=O group.\n\nLet's analyze the position and resulting chemical shift for each proton:\n\n1.  **Proton X ($\\theta_X = 0^\\circ$)**: This proton is located directly on the C=O bond axis. This position is deep within the shielding cone. It will experience the strongest shielding effect among the three protons. A strong shielding effect means the effective magnetic field $B_{\\text{eff}}$ is maximally reduced, leading to the **lowest chemical shift, $\\delta_X$**.\n\n2.  **Proton Z ($\\theta_Z = 90^\\circ$)**: This proton is located in the equatorial plane perpendicular to the C=O axis. This position is in the heart of the deshielding zone. It will experience the strongest deshielding effect. A strong deshielding effect means the effective magnetic field $B_{\\text{eff}}$ is maximally increased, leading to the **highest chemical shift, $\\delta_Z$**.\n\n3.  **Proton Y ($\\theta_Y = 60^\\circ$)**: This proton is located at an intermediate angle. The anisotropic effect is zero at the magic angle, $\\theta \\approx 54.7^\\circ$. Since $60^\\circ$ is greater than the magic angle, Proton Y falls just within the deshielding zone. However, its position is much closer to the zero-effect cone than Proton Z is. Therefore, it will experience a deshielding effect that is weaker than that for Proton Z but will be more deshielded than Proton X.\n    *Correction*: The geometric factor is $(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$. For $\\Delta\\chi$ of a carbonyl (negative), a positive geometric factor means shielding, and a negative one means deshielding.\n    - At $\\theta = 0^\\circ$, $(3\\cos^2(0) - 1) = +2$ (Strongest Shielding).\n    - At $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, $(3\\cos^2(90) - 1) = -1$ (Strongest Deshielding).\n    - At $\\theta = 60^\\circ$, $(3\\cos^2(60) - 1) = 3(0.5)^2 - 1 = 0.75 - 1 = -0.25$. This corresponds to a weak deshielding effect.\n    Therefore, Proton Y is deshielded, but much less so than Proton Z.\n\n    Wait, my initial intuition about the zones was slightly off. Let's re-evaluate based on the geometric factor.\n    - The magic angle ($54.7^\\circ$) separates the shielding cone from the deshielding zone.\n    - For $\\theta  54.7^\\circ$, the effect is shielding.\n    - For $\\theta > 54.7^\\circ$, the effect is deshielding.\n    Since $\\theta_Y = 60^\\circ$, it is in the deshielding zone.\n    However, the magnitude of the deshielding effect for Proton Y (proportional to -0.25) is weaker than the deshielding effect for Proton Z (proportional to -1). Proton X is strongly shielded (proportional to +2).\n\nThe order of effects from most shielding to most deshielding is: X (strong shielding)  Y (weak deshielding)  Z (strong deshielding).\nTranslating this to chemical shifts (where deshielding means higher $\\delta$):\n$$ \\delta_Z > \\delta_Y > \\delta_X $$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe highest chemical shift belongs to the most deshielded proton (Z), and the lowest chemical shift belongs to the most shielded proton (X). Proton Y is at an intermediate position. The correct ordering of chemical shifts from highest to lowest is $\\delta_Z > \\delta_Y > \\delta_X$.
