The equations of motion for small oscillations in the normal ($n$) and tangential ($t$) directions, assuming the contact is sticking, are uncoupled and represent simple harmonic oscillators:\n$$m \\ddot{u}_n + k_n u_n = 0$$\n$$m \\ddot{u}_t + k_t u_t = 0$$\nwhere $u_n$ and $u_t$ are the displacements from the equilibrium contact point.

These frequencies are physically relevant for the time step calculation only if the contact is in a sticking state.\n\n**(ii) Determination of Sticking vs. Sliding State**\nThe state of the contact is governed by the Coulomb friction law. The contact is sticking if the magnitude of the tangential force, $|F_t|$, is less than or equal to the maximum allowable static friction force, $\\mu |F_n|$.\nFirst, we compute the normal force, $F_n$, from the given normal overlap $\\delta_n$ and normal stiffness $k_n$:\n$$F_n = k_n \\delta_n = (8.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ N/m}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}) = 160 \\text{ N}$$\nNext, we compute the tangential force, $F_t$, from the tangential displacement $\\delta_t$ and tangential stiffness $k_t$:\n$$F_t = k_t \\delta_t = (2.4 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ N/m}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) = 12 \\text{ N}$$\nThe maximum static friction force is:\n$$F_{f,max} = \\mu F_n = 0.50 \\times 160 \\text{ N} = 80 \\text{ N}$$\nSince $|F_t| = 12 \\text{ N} \\le F_{f,max} = 80 \\text{ N}$, the contact is in a **sticking** state.
