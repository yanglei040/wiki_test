The process involves several steps: derivation of the governing partial differential equation (PDE), solving the PDE using separation of variables, identifying the dominant decay time, and finally, numerical evaluation.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equation. The problem starts from the principle of fluid mass conservation in a porous medium, which can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\zeta}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\zeta$ is the variation of fluid content per unit bulk volume, and $\\mathbf{q}$ is the specific discharge vector of the fluid relative to the solid skeleton.\n\nDarcy's law relates the specific discharge to the gradient of the excess pore fluid pressure, $p$. Neglecting gravity effects on the excess pressure as stated, this relationship is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{q} = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla p\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the pore fluid.\n\nThe constitutive relation for the variation of fluid content in linear poroelasticity is given by:\n$$\n\\zeta = \\frac{p}{M} + \\alpha \\epsilon_v\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the Biot modulus, $\\alpha$ is the Biot coefficient, and $\\epsilon_v = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$ is the volumetric strain of the solid skeleton, with $\\mathbf{u}$ being the displacement vector of the solid.\n\nThe problem states a crucial simplification: \"the contribution of skeleton volumetric strain to storage is negligible compared to fluid storage\". This allows us to approximate the fluid content variation as:\n$$\n\\zeta \\approx \\frac{p}{M}\n$$\nThis is a standard assumption for materials where the solid matrix is much stiffer than the fluid, or more accurately, when the compressibility of the fluid in the pores dominates the storage capacity.\n\nSubstituting Darcy's law and the simplified constitutive relation for $\\zeta$ into the fluid mass conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\frac{p}{M}\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla p\\right) = 0\n$$\nAssuming the properties $M$, $k$, and $\\mu$ are constant and uniform as stated, we can pull them out of the derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{M} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} - \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla^2 p = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the diffusion equation for pore pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{kM}{\\mu} \\nabla^2 p\n$$\nFor the one-dimensional problem considered, where pressure varies only in the $z$-direction, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nwhere the hydraulic diffusivity, $c$, is defined as:\n$$\nc = \\frac{kM}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nNext, we solve this PDE subject to the given boundary and initial conditions.\nThe PDE is $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}$ for $z \\in (0, H)$ and $t > 0$.\nThe boundary conditions (BCs) are for perfectly drained surfaces: $p(0, t) = 0$ and $p(H, t) = 0$ for $t > 0$.\nThe initial condition (IC) is a uniform excess pore pressure: $p(z, 0) = p_0$ for $z \\in (0, H)$.\n\nWe use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $p(z, t) = Z(z)T(t)$.

The physical coordinate $x$ is mapped from the parent coordinate $\\xi \\in [-1, 1]$ using the standard linear shape functions $N = [N_1, N_2]$, where $N_1(\\xi) = (1-\\xi)/2$ and $N_2(\\xi) = (1+\\xi)/2$. The Jacobian of the transformation is $J = \\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}\\xi = L_e/2$. The differential volume element is $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = A \\, \\mathrm{d}x = A J \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi$. Since $A=1$, $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = (L_e/2) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi$.\n\n**1. Consistent Mass Matrix ($M_e$)**\n\nThe mass matrix is defined as $M_e = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\rho c \\, N^T N \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$. Assuming the volumetric heat capacity $\\rho c$ is constant over the element, we have:\n$$\nM_e = \\rho c \\int_{\\Omega_e} N^T N \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\rho c A \\int_{-1}^{1} \\begin{bmatrix} N_1(\\xi) \\\\ N_2(\\xi) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} N_1(\\xi) & N_2(\\xi) \\end{bmatrix} J \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi\n$$\nSubstituting $N_1$, $N_2$, $J=L_e/2$, and $A=1$:\n$$\nM_e = \\rho c \\frac{L_e}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\begin{bmatrix} N_1^2 & N_1 N_2 \\\\ N_1 N_2 & N_2^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\mathrm{d}\\xi\n$$\nThe required definite integrals are:\n$\\int_{-1}^{1} N_1^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\frac{1-\\xi}{2}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{d}\\xi = \\frac{2}{3}$\n$\\int_{-1}^{1} N_2^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\frac{1+\\xi}{2}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{d}\\xi = \\frac{2}{3}$\n$\\int_{-1}^{1} N_1 N_2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1-\\xi^2}{4} \\mathrm{d}\\xi = \\frac{1}{3}$\nSubstituting these results, we obtain the consistent mass matrix:\n$$\nM_e = \\rho c \\frac{L_e}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 2/3 & 1/3 \\\\ 1/3 & 2/3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{\\rho c L_e}{6} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2.

With $A=1$ and $J=L_e/2$:\n$$\nf_{r,e}^{n+\\theta} = r^{n+\\theta} (1) \\frac{L_e}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{r^{n+\\theta} L_e}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2.
