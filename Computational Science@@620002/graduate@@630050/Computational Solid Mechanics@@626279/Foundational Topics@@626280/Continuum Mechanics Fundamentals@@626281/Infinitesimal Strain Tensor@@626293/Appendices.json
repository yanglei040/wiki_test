This exercise provides foundational practice in computing the infinitesimal strain tensor directly from its definition for a simple, linear displacement field. By working through this problem, you will solidify your understanding of how to calculate normal and shear strains and interpret them in terms of volume change and rotation.

Starting from the fundamental definitions of the displacement gradient, the infinitesimal strain tensor, and the infinitesimal rotation tensor, do the following: compute all components of the infinitesimal strain tensor, compute the volumetric strain (defined as the trace of the infinitesimal strain tensor), compute the infinitesimal rotation tensor to assess whether the deformation is irrotational, and classify the deformation in terms of its volumetric and distortional character by stating algebraic conditions on $a$, $b$, and $c$ under which it is a pure dilatation, an isochoric distortion, or a general triaxial stretch. Use only balance and kinematic principles appropriate to small-strain elastostatics; do not invoke any finite-deformation measures.

It is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe displacement field is provided in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ as $\\mathbf{u}(x,y,z)$. Its components are given by:\n$u_x(x,y,z) = a\\,x$\n$u_y(x,y,z) = b\\,y$\n$u_z(x,y,z) = c\\,z$\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are small, real constants, satisfying $|a|, |b|, |c| \\ll 1$. This condition justifies the use of linearized, or infinitesimal, strain theory.\n\nFirst, we compute the displacement gradient tensor, $\\mathbf{H}$, whose components $H_{ij}$ are defined as the partial derivatives of the displacement components with respect to the spatial coordinates, $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$. Let $x_1=x$, $x_2=y$, $x_3=z$.\n\nThe components of $\\mathbf{H}$ are:\n$H_{11} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(a\\,x)}{\\partial x} = a$\n$H_{22} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(b\\,y)}{\\partial y} = b$\n$H_{33} = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial(c\\,z)}{\\partial z} = c$\n\nAll off-diagonal components are zero, for example:\n$H_{12} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(a\\,x)}{\\partial y} = 0$\n$H_{21} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(b\\,y)}{\\partial x} = 0$\nThis holds for all $i \\neq j$. Thus, the displacement gradient tensor is a diagonal matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe displacement gradient tensor $\\mathbf{H}$ can be decomposed into a symmetric part, the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, and a skew-symmetric part, the infinitesimal rotation tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$. This is the fundamental Helmholtz decomposition of a second-order tensor: $\\mathbf{H} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} + \\boldsymbol{\\omega}$.\n\nThe infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is defined as $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (H_{ij} + H_{ji})$. Since our calculated $\\mathbf{H}$ is already a symmetric matrix ($H_{ij} = H_{ji}$), its skew-symmetric part is zero and its symmetric part is itself.\nTherefore, the infinitesimal strain tensor is identical to the displacement gradient tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the strain tensor are:\n$\\varepsilon_{xx} = a$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = b$, $\\varepsilon_{zz} = c$.\nThe shear strain components are all zero: $\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = \\varepsilon_{zx} = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the volumetric strain, $\\varepsilon_V$, which is defined as the trace of the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\varepsilon_V = \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_V = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\nSubstituting the components we have found:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_V = a + b + c\n$$\nThis quantity represents the infinitesimal change in volume per unit original volume.\n\nThe infinitesimal rotation tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is defined as $\\omega_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (H_{ij} - H_{ji})$. Since $\\mathbf{H}$ is symmetric, all components of $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ are identically zero.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{H} - \\mathbf{H}^T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a-a & 0-0 & 0-0 \\\\ 0-0 & b-b & 0-0 \\\\ 0-0 & 0-0 & c-c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA zero rotation tensor signifies that the deformation is irrotational. Such a deformation is also called a pure strain or pure stretch.\n\nFinally, we classify the deformation. The strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ can be decomposed into a spherical part (related to volume change) and a deviatoric part (related to shape change or distortion).\n$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{spherical}} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{deviatoric}}$\nThe spherical part is given by $\\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} = \\frac{1}{3}(a+b+c)\\mathbf{I}$.\nThe deviatoric part is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I}$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 2a-b-c & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2b-a-c & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2c-a-b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe deformation is classified as follows:\n$1$. **Pure Dilatation**: A purely volumetric change with no distortion. This occurs when the deviatoric strain tensor is zero, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\mathbf{0}$. This requires that all diagonal elements of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ are zero, which leads to the condition $a=b=c$. In this case, there is uniform expansion or contraction in all directions.\n\n$2$. **Isochoric Distortion**: A purely distortional change of shape with no change in volume. \"Isochoric\" means volume-preserving. This occurs when the volumetric strain is zero, $\\varepsilon_V = 0$. The algebraic condition is therefore $a+b+c=0$.\n\n$3$. **General Triaxial Stretch**: This is the most general case for this deformation field, where there is both a change in volume and a change in shape. This occurs when neither of the above two special conditions is met, i.e., when $(a,b,c)$ are not all equal AND $a+b+c \\neq 0$.\n\nThe problem requires a single final answer, which is the symbolic expression for the volumetric strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{a+b+c}$$", "id": "2620349"}, {"introduction": "The infinitesimal strain tensor is a powerful and widely used simplification, but it is fundamentally an approximation valid only for small deformations.

For instance, $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\xi} x_i = \\frac{1}{4}[-(1-\\eta)x_1 + (1-\\eta)x_2 + (1+\\eta)x_3 - (1+\\eta)x_4] = \\frac{1}{4}[L(1-\\eta) + L(1+\\eta)] = \\frac{L}{2}$. After calculating all components, we find that the Jacobian is constant and diagonal:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{J} = \\begin{bmatrix} L/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & H/2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nConsequently, its inverse and determinant are also constant:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{J}^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2/L & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2/H \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\det(\\boldsymbol{J}) = \\frac{LH}{4}\n$$\nThe infinitesimal strain component $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ is defined as $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x}$. Using the inverse chain rule, $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = J_{11}^{-1} \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial \\xi} + J_{12}^{-1} \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial \\eta}$. With our simplified $\\boldsymbol{J}^{-1}$, this becomes $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{2}{L} \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial \\xi}$.\nThe displacement component $u_x$ is interpolated as $u_x(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(\\xi, \\eta) u_{xi}$, where $u_{xi}$ are the nodal displacements in the $x$-direction. Its derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial \\xi} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\xi} u_{xi} = \\frac{1}{4} [-(1-\\eta)u_{x1} + (1-\\eta)u_{x2} + (1+\\eta)u_{x3} - (1+\\eta)u_{x4}]\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into a linear function of $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\frac{2}{L} \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial \\xi} = \\frac{1}{2L} [ (u_{x2}-u_{x1}) + (u_{x3}-u_{x4}) + \\eta((u_{x3}-u_{x4}) - (u_{x2}-u_{x1})) ]\n$$\nWe define constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ such that $\\varepsilon_{xx}(\\eta) = C_1 + C_2 \\eta$:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{1}{2L} [ (u_{x2}-u_{x1}) + (u_{x3}-u_{x4}) ]\n$$\n$$\nC_2 = \\frac{1}{2L} [ (u_{x3}-u_{x4}) - (u_{x2}-u_{x1}) ]\n$$\nThe integral $I$ is transformed to the reference domain: $I = \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} (\\varepsilon_{xx}(\\xi,\\eta))^2 \\det(\\boldsymbol{J}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta$. Since $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ is independent of $\\xi$ and $\\det(\\boldsymbol{J})$ is constant, we have:\n$$\nI = \\frac{LH}{4} \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} (C_1 + C_2\\eta)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta = \\frac{LH}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} (C_1 + C_2\\eta)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta\n$$\nThe integrand is a quadratic polynomial in $\\eta$.\nThe exact value of the integral is $I_{\\text{exact}} = \\frac{LH}{2} \\left[ C_1^2 \\eta + C_1 C_2 \\eta^2 + \\frac{C_2^2}{3}\\eta^3 \\right]_{-1}^{1} = LH(C_1^2 + \\frac{C_2^2}{3})$.\n\nWe now evaluate this integral using the two specified quadrature schemes:\n1.  **Reduced Integration ($1 \\times 1$)**: A single Gauss point at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(0,0)$ with weight $w=4$.\n    $$ I_{\\text{reduced}} = (\\varepsilon_{xx}(0))^2 \\det(\\boldsymbol{J}) \\times w = C_1^2 \\left(\\frac{LH}{4}\\right) \\times 4 = LH C_1^2 $$\n2.  **Full Integration ($2 \\times 2$)**: Four Gauss points at $(\\xi, \\eta) \\in \\{\\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}\\} \\times \\{\\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}\\}$ with unit weights ($w=1$). Since the integrand only depends on $\\eta$, the integral becomes:\n    $$ I_{\\text{full}} = \\det(\\boldsymbol{J}) \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\sum_{j=1}^2 w_i w_j (\\varepsilon_{xx}(\\eta_j))^2 = \\frac{LH}{4} \\times 2 \\times [(\\varepsilon_{xx}(1/\\sqrt{3}))^2 + (\\varepsilon_{xx}(-1/\\sqrt{3}))^2] $$\n    $$ I_{\\text{full}} = \\frac{LH}{2} [(C_1 + C_2/\\sqrt{3})^2 + (C_1 - C_2/\\sqrt{3})^2] = \\frac{LH}{2} [2C_1^2 + 2C_2^2/3] = LH(C_1^2 + \\frac{C_2^2}{3}) $$\n    This matches the exact integral, as a $2$-point Gauss rule is exact for polynomials of degree up to $2(2)-1=3$.\n\nNow we analyze the three test cases using these derived formulas.\n\n**Test A: Pure Bending-like Field**\nNodal displacements are derived from $u_x(x,y) = -kxy$: $u_{x1}=0$, $u_{x2}=0$, $u_{x3}=-kLH$, $u_{x4}=0$.\nWith $L=1.0$, $H=0.4$, $k=2.0$, we have $u_{x3} = -2.0 \\times 1.0 \\times 0.4 = -0.8$.\nThe nodal vector is $u_x = [0, 0, -0.8, 0]$.\n$C_1 = \\frac{1}{2(1.0)} [ (0-0) + (-0.8-0) ] = -0.4$.\n$C_2 = \\frac{1}{2(1.0)} [ (-0.8-0) - (0-0) ] = -0.4$.\nThe ratio $r_A = I_{\\text{reduced}} / I_{\\text{full}}$ is:\n$$ r_A = \\frac{LH C_1^2}{LH(C_1^2 + C_2^2/3)} = \\frac{(-0.4)^2}{(-0.4)^2 + (-0.4)^2/3} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 $$\n\n**Test B: Hourglass Nodal Pattern**\nNodal displacements are $u_x = [a, -a, a, -a]$ for nodes $1, 2, 3, 4$. With $a=1.0$, $L=1.0$, $H=0.4$:\n$u_{x1}=1.0$, $u_{x2}=-1.0$, $u_{x3}=1.0$, $u_{x4}=-1.0$.\n$C_1 = \\frac{1}{2(1.0)} [ (-1.0-1.0) + (1.0 - (-1.0)) ] = \\frac{1}{2} [-2.0 + 2.0] = 0$.\n$C_2 = \\frac{1}{2(1.0)} [ (1.0 - (-1.0)) - (-1.0-1.0) ] = \\frac{1}{2} [2.0 - (-2.0)] = 2.0$.\nThe integrals are:\n$I_{\\text{reduced}} = LH C_1^2 = 1.0 \\times 0.4 \\times 0^2 = 0$.\n$I_{\\text{full}} = LH(C_1^2 + C_2^2/3) = 1.0 \\times 0.4 \\times (0^2 + 2.0^2/3) = 0.4 \\times 4/3 = 1.6/3 \\approx 0.533333$.\nThe boolean flag $h_B$ is true if $I_{\\text{reduced}} \\le 10^{-12}$ and $I_{\\text{full}} \\ge 10^{-6}$.\n$0 \\le 10^{-12}$ is True. $0.533333 \\ge 10^{-6}$ is True. Thus, $h_B$ is True. This case demonstrates that reduced integration fails to detect the deformation energy of the hourglass mode.\n\n**Test C: Mixed Field**\nThe nodal displacements are the superposition of the fields from Test A and Test B, with $k=2.0$, $a=0.1$.\n$C_1$ and $C_2$ are also superpositions of the coefficients from the two cases.\n$C_{1,\\text{mix}} = C_{1,\\text{bend}} + C_{1,\\text{hg}} = -0.4 + 0 = -0.4$.\nFor $C_2$, we recompute the hourglass contribution with $a=0.1$: $C_{2,\\text{hg}} = \\frac{2a}{L} = \\frac{2(0.1)}{1.0} = 0.2$.\n$C_{2,\\text{mix}} = C_{2,\\text{bend}} + C_{2,\\text{hg}} = -0.4 + 0.2 = -0.2$.\nThe ratio $r_C = I_{\\text{reduced}} / I_{\\text{full}}$ is:\n$$ r_C = \\frac{C_{1,\\text{mix}}^2}{C_{1,\\text{mix}}^2 + C_{2,\\text{mix}}^2/3} = \\frac{(-0.4)^2}{(-0.4)^2 + (-0.2)^2/3} = \\frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.04/3} $$\n$$ r_C = \\frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.01333...} = \\frac{0.16}{0.17333...} = \\frac{0.48}{0.52} = \\frac{12}{13} \\approx 0.923077 $$\n\nFinal results to be formatted are $r_A=0.75$, $h_B=\\text{True}$, and $r_C \\approx 0.923077$.", "answer": "[0.750000,True,0.923077]", "id": "3574313"}]}
