I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe relationship $F_2 = R F_1$ describes a deformation $F_1$ followed by a rigid body rotation $R$ applied to the current configuration. The principle of material frame indifference (objectivity) dictates how constitutive quantities must behave under such a transformation. We will analyze each quantity based on this principle and the hyperelastic, isotropic material assumptions.\n\nLet's first compute the right Cauchy-Green tensor for both deformations.\nFor $F_1$, let $C_1 = F_1^{\\mathsf{T}} F_1$.\nFor $F_2$, let $C_2 = F_2^{\\mathsf{T}} F_2$.\nSubstituting $F_2 = R F_1$:\n$$\nC_2 = (R F_1)^{\\mathsf{T}} (R F_1) = F_1^{\\mathsf{T}} R^{\\mathsf{T}} R F_1\n$$\nSince $R$ is a rotation matrix, $R^{\\mathsf{T}} R = I$, where $I$ is the identity tensor.\n$$\nC_2 = F_1^{\\mathsf{T}} I F_1 = F_1^{\\mathsf{T}} F_1 = C_1\n$$\nThe right Cauchy-Green tensor, which measures the deformation in the reference configuration, is identical for both $F_1$ and $F_2$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option.\n\n**D. The strain energy density satisfies $W(F_2) = W(F_1)$.**\nFor a hyperelastic material, there exists a strain energy density function $W$. Material frame indifference requires that this scalar function be independent of a superimposed rigid rotation on the spatial configuration, i.e., $W(R F) = W(F)$ for any rotation $R$. In our case, $F_2 = R F_1$, so it follows directly from this principle that $W(F_2) = W(F_1)$.\nAlternatively, for an isotropic hyperelastic material, $W$ is a function of the invariants of $C$. Since we have shown that $C_2 = C_1$, their invariants must be identical. Therefore, $W(C_2) = W(C_1)$, which means $W(F_2) = W(F_1)$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**A. The second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensors satisfy $S(F_2) = S(F_1)$.**\nThe second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $S$ is a referential quantity. For a hyperelastic material, it is derived from the strain energy density function as $S = 2 \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial C}$. Since $W$ is a function of $C$ (or more specifically, its invariants for an isotropic material), $S$ is also a function of $C$.\nLet $S_1 = S(F_1)$ and $S_2 = S(F_2)$. In terms of $C$, these are $S_1 = S(C_1)$ and $S_2 = S(C_2)$.\nAs established earlier, $C_1 = C_2$. Therefore, it must be that $S(C_1) = S(C_2)$, which implies $S(F_1) = S(F_2)$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The first Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensors are related by $P(F_2) = R\\,P(F_1)$.**\nThe first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $P$ is related to the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $S$ by the formula $P = F S$.\nLet $P_1 = P(F_1) = F_1 S_1$ and $P_2 = P(F_2) = F_2 S_2$.\nFrom the analysis for option A, we know that $S_2 = S_1$. Substituting this and $F_2 = R F_1$ into the expression for $P_2$:\n$$\nP_2 = F_2 S_2 = (R F_1) S_1 = R (F_1 S_1)\n$$\nSince $P_1 = F_1 S_1$, we have:\n$$\nP_2 = R P_1\n$$\nThis matches the statement $P(F_2) = R\\,P(F_1)$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The first Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensors satisfy $P(F_2) = P(F_1)$.**\nFrom the analysis for option C, we found that $P_2 = R P_1$. The statement $P_2 = P_1$ would imply $R P_1 = P_1$. This equality holds only if $R=I$ or $P_1=0$.\nIn this problem, $R$ is explicitly given and is not the identity matrix. $P_1$ is not generally the zero tensor for an arbitrary non-zero deformation $F_1$. For the given $F_1$, the material is stretched, so we expect a non-zero stress response ($S_1 \\neq 0$ and thus $P_1 \\neq 0$). Therefore, in general, $P_2 \\neq P_1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The Cauchy stress tensors satisfy $\\sigma(F_2) = \\sigma(F_1)$.**\nThe Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ is a spatial tensor. The principle of material frame indifference requires that the Cauchy stress transforms as follows under a superimposed rotation:\n$$\n\\sigma(R F) = R \\sigma(F) R^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nThis is a direct consequence of objectivity. Applying this to our case where $F_2 = R F_1$:\n$$\n\\sigma(F_2) = \\sigma(R F_1) = R \\sigma(F_1) R^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nLet $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma(F_1)$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma(F_2)$. Then $\\sigma_2 = R \\sigma_1 R^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\nThe statement $\\sigma(F_2) = \\sigma(F_1)$ implies $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_1$, which would require $R \\sigma_1 R^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\sigma_1$. This is not true for an arbitrary tensor $\\sigma_1$ and a rotation $R \\neq I$. For this to hold, $\\sigma_1$ would need to commute with $R$, which is not generally the case. As a specific counter-example, for the given $F_1$, the principal stretches are $(2, 1, 1)$, so for an isotropic material, the principal axes of $\\sigma_1$ will be the coordinate axes. $\\sigma_1$ will be a diagonal tensor, e.g., $\\sigma_1 = \\text{diag}(\\sigma_{11}, \\sigma_{22}, \\sigma_{33})$. Unless $\\sigma_{11}=\\sigma_{22}$, this tensor will not commute with the given $R$ (a rotation in the $x-y$ plane), so $R \\sigma_1 R^{\\mathsf{T}} \\neq \\sigma_1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal conclusion: Statements A, C, and D are necessarily true.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3591919"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice tackles the most advanced and computationally significant transformation in this topic: the push-forward of the fourth-order material elasticity tensor.

Foundational Relations and Objective Rates**\n\nWe are given the following core relations:\n- The relationship between the symmetric Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ (in the spatial configuration) and the symmetric Second Piola-Kirchhoff (2nd P-K) stress tensor $\\mathbf{S}$ (in the material configuration):\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{J} \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\quad \\text{where } J = \\det(\\mathbf{F})\n$$\nIt is more convenient to work with the Kirchhoff stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = J\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, which simplifies the relation to:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\n- The material constitutive law, relating the rate of 2nd P-K stress $\\dot{\\mathbf{S}}$ to the rate of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor $\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}$ via the fourth-order material elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{S}} = \\mathbb{C} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}} \\quad \\text{or in index form,} \\quad \\dot{S}_{IJ} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\dot{E}_{KL}\n$$\n\nTo establish a consistent spatial constitutive law, we must use objective (frame-indifferent) time derivatives of spatial quantities. A standard choice is the Lie derivative, $\\mathcal{L}_v$. The spatial constitutive law will relate the Lie derivative of a stress tensor to the spatial rate of deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{d}$. The tensor $\\mathbf{d}$ is the symmetric part of the spatial velocity gradient $\\mathbf{l} = \\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1}$, i.e., $\\mathbf{d} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{l} + \\mathbf{l}^{\\mathsf{T}})$.\n\n**2. Kinematic and Stress Rate Transformations**\n\nFirst, we relate the material strain rate $\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}$ to the spatial rate of deformation $\\mathbf{d}$. The Green-Lagrange strain tensor is $\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F} - \\mathbf{I})$. Its material time derivative is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\dot{\\mathbf{F}})\n$$\nSubstituting $\\dot{\\mathbf{F}} = \\mathbf{l}\\mathbf{F}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\frac{1}{2}((\\mathbf{l}\\mathbf{F})^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}(\\mathbf{l}\\mathbf{F})) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{l}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{l}\\mathbf{F}) = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{l}^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\mathbf{l}) \\right) \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{F}\n$$\nThis operation, $\\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{F}$, is the pull-back of the spatial rate of deformation tensor $\\mathbf{d}$ to the reference configuration.\n\nNext, we establish the transformation for the stress rates. A fundamental result in continuum mechanics is that the Lie derivative of the Kirchhoff stress tensor, $\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, is the push-forward of the material time derivative of the 2nd P-K stress tensor, $\\dot{\\mathbf{S}}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} \\dot{\\mathbf{S}} \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nwhere $(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij} = \\dot{\\tau}_{ij} - l_{ik}\\tau_{kj} - \\tau_{ik}l_{kj}$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Spatial Elasticity Tensor**\n\nWe can now combine these relations to derive the spatial constitutive law.\nStarting with the stress rate transformation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} \\dot{\\mathbf{S}} \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nSubstitute the material constitutive law, $\\dot{\\mathbf{S}} = \\mathbb{C} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbb{C} : \\dot{\\mathbf{E}}) \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nNow, substitute the kinematic relation $\\dot{\\mathbf{E}} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{F}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbb{C} : (\\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{F})) \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nTo make the structure clear, we write this in index notation. Let capital indices ($I, J, K, L$) denote the material configuration and lower-case indices ($i, j, k, l$) denote the spatial configuration.\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij} = F_{iI} (\\dot{S}_{IJ}) F_{jJ}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{S}_{IJ} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\dot{E}_{KL} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} (F_{kK} d_{kl} F_{lL})\n$$\nSubstituting $\\dot{S}_{IJ}$ into the expression for $(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij}$:\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij} = F_{iI} (\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} F_{kK} d_{kl} F_{lL}) F_{jJ}\n$$\nRearranging the terms (as they are all scalars summed over repeated indices):\n$$\n(\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_{ij} = (F_{iI} F_{jJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}) d_{kl}\n$$\nThe spatial constitutive law relates an objective stress rate to the rate of deformation, typically as $\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{c}_{\\tau} : \\mathbf{d}$, where $\\mathbf{c}_{\\tau}$ is the spatial elasticity tensor corresponding to the Kirchhoff stress. By comparison, we identify its components as:\n$$\n(c_{\\tau})_{ijkl} = F_{iI} F_{jJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the spatial counterpart of $\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}$ consistent with the Cauchy stress transformation. This corresponds to the tensor that relates the Truesdell rate of Cauchy stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^\\nabla$ to $\\mathbf{d}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^\\nabla = \\frac{1}{J}\\mathcal{L}_v \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. The relationship is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^\\nabla = \\mathbf{c} : \\mathbf{d}$.\nFrom this, we have $\\mathbf{c} = \\frac{1}{J}\\mathbf{c}_{\\tau}$. Thus, the components of the spatial elasticity tensor $\\mathbf{c}$ are:\n$$\nc_{ijkl} = \\frac{1}{J} F_{iI} F_{jJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}\n$$\nThis is the required push-forward mapping.\n\n**4. Preservation of Symmetries**\n\nThe material tensor $\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL}$ for a hyperelastic material possesses minor symmetries ($\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} = \\mathbb{C}_{JIKL}$ and $\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJLK}$) and major symmetry ($\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} = \\mathbb{C}_{KLIJ}$). The derived push-forward mapping preserves these symmetries. For example, to prove the first minor symmetry $c_{ijkl} = c_{jikl}$:\n\\begin{align*}\nc_{jikl} = \\frac{1}{J} F_{jI} F_{iJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{J} F_{jJ} F_{iI} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{JIKL} \\quad (\\text{swapping dummy indices } I \\leftrightarrow J) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{J} F_{iI} F_{jJ} F_{kK} F_{lL} \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\quad (\\text{using } \\mathbb{C}_{JIKL} = \\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} \\text{ and rearranging terms}) \\\\\n= c_{ijkl}\n\\end{align*}\nSimilar proofs hold for the other minor symmetry and the major symmetry, confirming that if $\\mathbb{C}$ has these symmetries, so will the pushed-forward tensor $c$.\n\n**5. Material and Spatial Isotropic Tensors**\n\nFor an isotropic material, the elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$ in the reference configuration is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}_{IJKL} = \\lambda \\delta_{IJ} \\delta_{KL} + \\mu (\\delta_{IK} \\delta_{JL} + \\delta_{IL} \\delta_{JK})\n$$\nIf the deformation is a pure rotation, $\\mathbf{F} \\in SO(3)$, then $\\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{I}$ and $J=1$. The push-forward operation simplifies, yielding the same isotropic form in the spatial configuration:\n$$\nc_{ijkl} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{kl} + \\mu (\\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il} \\delta_{jk})\n$$\nThis property, known as material frame-indifference, will be verified numerically.\n\nThe following Python code implements this derived mapping and performs the required checks.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and implements the push-forward of the material elasticity tensor,\n    verifying symmetry and rotational invariance properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define Lamé parameters and tolerance\n    lambda_ = 5.0\n    mu = 2.0\n    tol = 1e-10\n\n    # Define the test suite of deformation gradients\n    test_cases = [\n        # 1.
