The governing equations, constitutive relations, and boundary conditions are standard for modeling the thickness-mode vibration of a piezoelectric plate. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient conditions to derive a unique solution for the eigenfrequencies in both short-circuit and open-circuit cases. The language is objective and formal.\n\nThe assumption for the short-circuit case, that zero potential difference implies $E_3(z,t) = 0$ everywhere, is a simplification. In a fully dynamic analysis, $\\int_0^h E_3 \\, dz = 0$ does not necessitate $E_3=0$ pointwise. However, the problem explicitly states this as an imposed condition (\"...implying $E_{3}(z,t)=0$\"). As such, it is treated as a given premise for this specific problem, which is a common pedagogical approach to isolate the effect of electromechanical coupling on the effective stiffness. The open-circuit condition, $D_3(z,t)=0$, is a correct consequence of zero net charge on the electrodes combined with Gauss's law for dielectrics.\n\nThe problem is complete, consistent, and solvable using standard mathematical physics techniques. It is a non-trivial but standard exercise in multiphysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation proceeds by formulating a one-dimensional wave equation for each electrical boundary condition, solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem, and then using the resulting eigenfrequencies to compute the required normalized shift.\n\nFrom Gauss's law, $\\partial D_{3}/\\partial z = 0$, it follows that the electric displacement $D_3$ is spatially uniform, i.e., $D_3(z,t) = D_3(t)$.\n\n**Part 1: Eigenvalue Problem and Eigenfrequencies**\n\n**Case A: Short-Circuit (SC) Conditions**\nUnder the short-circuit condition as specified, $E_{3}(z,t) = 0$. Substituting this into the constitutive equation for stress $T_3$ yields:\n$$\nT_{3} = c_{33}^{E}\\,S_{3} - e_{33}(0) = c_{33}^{E}\\,S_{3}\n$$\nThe momentum balance equation is $\\partial T_{3}/\\partial z = \\rho\\,\\partial^{2} u_{3}/\\partial t^{2}$. Substituting the expression for $T_3$ and the definition of strain $S_{3} = \\partial u_{3}/\\partial z$, we obtain the wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(c_{33}^{E} \\frac{\\partial u_{3}}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\rho\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} u_{3}}{\\partial t^{2}} \\implies c_{33}^{E} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u_{3}}{\\partial z^{2}} = \\rho\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} u_{3}}{\\partial t^{2}}\n$$\nFor a harmonic vibration of the form $u_{3}(z,t) = U(z)\\,\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega t)$, the time derivatives become $\\partial^{2} u_{3}/\\partial t^{2} = -\\omega^{2} U(z)\\,\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega t)$. The wave equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation for the mode shape $U(z)$:\n$$\nc_{33}^{E} \\frac{d^{2}U}{dz^{2}} = -\\rho\\,\\omega^{2} U \\implies \\frac{d^{2}U}{dz^{2}} + \\left(\\frac{\\rho\\,\\omega^{2}}{c_{33}^{E}}\\right) U = 0\n$$\nThis is the eigenvalue problem. The effective elastic stiffness is $c_{33}^{E}$. Let the wavenumber be $k_{\\mathrm{sc}}^{2} = \\rho\\,\\omega^{2}/c_{33}^{E}$. The equation is $\\frac{d^{2}U}{dz^{2}} + k_{\\mathrm{sc}}^{2} U = 0$.\n\nThe mechanical boundary conditions are $T_{3}(0,t)=T_{3}(h,t)=0$. Since $T_3 = c_{33}^E S_3 = c_{33}^E \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial z}$, these conditions translate to $\\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial z}(0,t) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial z}(h,t)=0$. In terms of the mode shape $U(z)$, we have $\\frac{dU}{dz}(0) = 0$ and $\\frac{dU}{dz}(h)=0$.\n\nThe general solution for $U(z)$ is $U(z) = C_1 \\cos(k_{\\mathrm{sc}} z) + C_2 \\sin(k_{\\mathrm{sc}} z)$. Its derivative is $\\frac{dU}{dz} = -C_1 k_{\\mathrm{sc}} \\sin(k_{\\mathrm{sc}} z) + C_2 k_{\\mathrm{sc}} \\cos(k_{\\mathrm{sc}} z)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition at $z=0$: $\\frac{dU}{dz}(0) = C_2 k_{\\mathrm{sc}} = 0$. For a non-trivial vibration, $k_{\\mathrm{sc}} \\neq 0$, so we must have $C_2=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $U(z) = C_1 \\cos(k_{\\mathrm{sc}} z)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition at $z=h$: $\\frac{dU}{dz}(h) = -C_1 k_{\\mathrm{sc}} \\sin(k_{\\mathrm{sc}} h) = 0$.\nFor a non-trivial solution ($C_1 \\neq 0$), we require $\\sin(k_{\\mathrm{sc}} h) = 0$. This implies $k_{\\mathrm{sc}} h = n\\pi$ for integers $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ (where $n=0$ corresponds to rigid body motion).\nSubstituting the definition of $k_{\\mathrm{sc}}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{sc},n}^{2}}{c_{33}^{E}}}\\right)h = n\\pi \\implies \\omega_{\\mathrm{sc},n}^{2} = \\frac{n^{2}\\pi^{2}c_{33}^{E}}{\\rho h^{2}}\n$$\nThe fundamental frequency ($n=1$) is $f_{\\mathrm{sc}} = \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sc},1}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2h}\\sqrt{\\frac{c_{33}^{E}}{\\rho}}$.\n\n**Case B: Open-Circuit (OC) Conditions**\nUnder the open-circuit condition, $D_{3}(z,t) = 0$. From the second constitutive relation, $0 = e_{33}S_{3} + \\epsilon_{33}^{S}E_{3}$, we can express the electric field in terms of the strain:\n$$\nE_{3} = -\\frac{e_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{S}} S_{3}\n$$\nSubstitute this into the first constitutive relation for stress $T_3$:\n$$\nT_{3} = c_{33}^{E}S_{3} - e_{33}\\left(-\\frac{e_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{S}}S_{3}\\right) = \\left(c_{33}^{E} + \\frac{e_{33}^{2}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{S}}\\right)S_{3}\n$$\nThe term in parentheses is the \"stiffened\" elastic modulus, which is given in the problem as $c_{33}^{D}$. Thus, $T_3 = c_{33}^{D} S_3$. The effective stiffness for the open-circuit case is $c_{33}^{D}$.\nThe momentum balance equation now becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(c_{33}^{D} \\frac{\\partial u_{3}}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\rho\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} u_{3}}{\\partial t^{2}} \\implies c_{33}^{D} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u_{3}}{\\partial z^{2}} = \\rho\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} u_{3}}{\\partial t^{2}}\n$$\nThis is a wave equation formally identical to the short-circuit case, but with $c_{33}^{E}$ replaced by $c_{33}^{D}$.\nThe eigenvalue problem is $\\frac{d^{2}U}{dz^{2}} + k_{\\mathrm{oc}}^{2} U = 0$, where the wavenumber is now $k_{\\mathrm{oc}}^{2} = \\rho\\,\\omega^{2}/c_{33}^{D}$.\nThe mechanical boundary conditions $T_3=0$ are unchanged. Since $T_3$ is still proportional to $S_3 = \\partial u_3 / \\partial z$, the boundary conditions on $U(z)$ remain $\\frac{dU}{dz}(0)=0$ and $\\frac{dU}{dz}(h)=0$.\nThe entire solution procedure is identical, leading to the condition $k_{\\mathrm{oc}} h = n\\pi$.\nSubstituting the definition of $k_{\\mathrm{oc}}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{oc},n}^{2}}{c_{33}^{D}}}\\right)h = n\\pi \\implies \\omega_{\\mathrm{oc},n}^{2} = \\frac{n^{2}\\pi^{2}c_{33}^{D}}{\\rho h^{2}}\n$$\nThe fundamental frequency ($n=1$) for the open-circuit case is $f_{\\mathrm{oc}} = \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{oc},1}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2h}\\sqrt{\\frac{c_{33}^{D}}{\\rho}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Normalized Frequency Shift**\nWe are asked to compute $\\Delta = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{oc}} - f_{\\mathrm{sc}}}{f_{\\mathrm{sc}}}$. This can be rewritten as $\\Delta = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{oc}}}{f_{\\mathrm{sc}}} - 1$.\nUsing the fundamental frequencies derived above:\n$$\n\\frac{f_{\\mathrm{oc}}}{f_{\\mathrm{sc}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2h}\\sqrt{\\frac{c_{33}^{D}}{\\rho}}}{\\frac{1}{2h}\\sqrt{\\frac{c_{33}^{E}}{\\rho}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{c_{33}^{D}}{c_{33}^{E}}}\n$$\nTherefore, the normalized frequency shift is:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{c_{33}^{D}}{c_{33}^{E}}} - 1\n$$\nWe must now express this in terms of the thickness electromechanical coupling factor $k_{t}^{2}$, defined as $k_{t}^{2} = \\dfrac{c_{33}^{D} - c_{33}^{E}}{c_{33}^{D}}$.\nWe can rearrange this definition to find the ratio $c_{33}^{D}/c_{33}^{E}$:\n$$\nk_{t}^{2} = 1 - \\frac{c_{33}^{E}}{c_{33}^{D}} \\implies \\frac{c_{33}^{E}}{c_{33}^{D}} = 1 - k_{t}^{2}\n$$\nInverting this gives the required ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{33}^{D}}{c_{33}^{E}} = \\frac{1}{1 - k_{t}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1 - k_{t}^{2}}} - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - k_{t}^{2}}} - 1\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the normalized frequency shift in terms of $k_{t}^{2}$ only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - k_{t}^{2}}} - 1}$$", "id": "3522470"}, {"introduction": "This final practice applies the principles of electro-mechanical coupling to the practical engineering problem of energy harvesting.

The constitutive relation simplifies to $D_3 = d_{31}T_1 + \\epsilon_{33}^T E_3$.\nThe source current is:\n$$\nI_{\\text{source}, 31}(t) = A \\frac{d}{dt}(d_{31}T_1) = A d_{31} \\frac{d}{dt}(T_{\\max}\\sin(\\omega t)) = A d_{31} T_{\\max} \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nThis is a sinusoidal current source with amplitude $\\hat{I}_{31} = A |d_{31}| T_{\\max} \\omega$. (Note: $d_{31}$ is typically negative, but power calculations depend on the magnitude squared, so the sign does not affect the final result).\n\nThe Norton circuit consists of this current source in parallel with the plate capacitance $C_p$ and the external resistive load $R_L$. For sinusoidal excitation, maximum time-averaged power is transferred to a purely resistive load $R_L$ when the load resistance equals the magnitude of the source impedance. The source impedance is that of the parallel capacitor, $Z_s = Z_{C_p} = \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_p}$. The optimal load resistance is therefore:\n$$\nR_{L, \\text{opt}} = |Z_{C_p}| = \\frac{1}{\\omega C_p}\n$$\nAt this optimal resistance, the current from the source splits equally in magnitude between the capacitor and the resistor. The amplitude of the current through the load is $|\\hat{I}_L| = \\frac{\\hat{I}_{31}}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThe time-averaged power delivered to the optimal load is:\n$$\nP_{\\max, 31} = \\frac{1}{2} |\\hat{I}_L|^2 R_{L, \\text{opt}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\hat{I}_{31}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\omega C_p} = \\frac{\\hat{I}_{31}^2}{4 \\omega C_p}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\hat{I}_{31}$ and $C_p$:\n$$\nP_{\\max, 31} = \\frac{(A d_{31} T_{\\max} \\omega)^2}{4 \\omega \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{33}^{T} A}{t}\\right)} = \\frac{A^2 d_{31}^2 T_{\\max}^2 \\omega^2 t}{4 \\omega \\epsilon_{33}^{T} A} = \\frac{A t \\, d_{31}^2 T_{\\max}^2 \\omega}{4 \\epsilon_{33}^{T}}\n$$\nThe problem requests power per unit volume. The volume of the plate is $V = A t$.\nThe maximum power density for the $d_{31}$ mode is:\n$$\np_{\\max, 31} = \\frac{P_{\\max, 31}}{V} = \\frac{P_{\\max, 31}}{A t} = \\frac{d_{31}^2 T_{\\max}^2 \\omega}{4 \\epsilon_{33}^{T}}\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Longitudinal Mode ($d_{33}$)**\nFor this mode, the active stress is the thickness stress $T_3$, so $T_3(t) = T_{\\max}\\sin(\\omega t)$. The constitutive relation becomes $D_3 = d_{33}T_3 + \\epsilon_{33}^T E_3$.\nThe derivation is identical to the transverse mode case, with $d_{31}$ replaced by $d_{33}$ and $T_1$ by $T_3$.\nThe source current amplitude is $\\hat{I}_{33} = A d_{33} T_{\\max} \\omega$.\nThe capacitance $C_p$ and optimal load resistance $R_{L, \\text{opt}}$ are unchanged because they depend on $A$, $t$, $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}$, and $\\omega$, which are identical for both cases.\nThe maximum time-averaged power is:\n$$\nP_{\\max, 33} = \\frac{\\hat{I}_{33}^2}{4 \\omega C_p} = \\frac{(A d_{33} T_{\\max} \\omega)^2}{4 \\omega \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{33}^{T} A}{t}\\right)} = \\frac{A t \\, d_{33}^2 T_{\\max}^2 \\omega}{4 \\epsilon_{33}^{T}}\n$$\nThe maximum power density for the $d_{33}$ mode is:\n$$\np_{\\max, 33} = \\frac{P_{\\max, 33}}{V} = \\frac{d_{33}^2 T_{\\max}^2 \\omega}{4 \\epsilon_{33}^{T}}\n$$\n\n**Ratio of Power Densities**\nThe required ratio is the maximum power density of the $d_{33}$ mode to that of the $d_{31}$ mode.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{p_{\\max, 33}}{p_{\\max, 31}} = \\frac{\\frac{d_{33}^2 T_{\\max}^2 \\omega}{4 \\epsilon_{33}^{T}}}{\\frac{d_{31}^2 T_{\\max}^2 \\omega}{4 \\epsilon_{33}^{T}}}\n$$\nThe common terms $T_{\\max}^2$, $\\omega$, $4$, and $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{d_{33}^2}{d_{31}^2} = \\left(\\frac{d_{33}}{d_{31}}\\right)^2\n$$\n\n**Geometric Trade-offs**\nThe expressions for maximum power density, $p_{\\max, 31}$ and $p_{\\max, 33}$, are independent of the geometric parameters $A$ and $t$. However, a significant geometric trade-off exists in the design of a device for a specific mode of operation, related to its output impedance. The choice of aspect ratio ($A$ versus $t$) for a fixed volume $V = At$ does not alter the maximum attainable power, but it heavily influences the voltage and current levels at which this power is delivered.\n\nSpecifically, the output voltage and current at the optimal load depend on geometry. The optimal load resistance is $R_{L, \\text{opt}} = \\frac{t}{\\omega \\epsilon_{33}^{T} A}$. For a fixed volume $V=At$, this can be written as $R_{L, \\text{opt}} = \\frac{t^2}{\\omega \\epsilon_{33}^{T} V}$.\nThe output voltage amplitude across this load is $\\hat{V}_L = \\frac{\\hat{I}_{\\text{source}}}{\\sqrt{2}} R_{L, \\text{opt}}$. For a generic mode 'i':\n$$\n\\hat{V}_L = \\frac{A |d_{3i}| T_{\\max} \\omega}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{t}{\\omega \\epsilon_{33}^{T} A} \\right) = \\frac{|d_{3i}| T_{\\max} t}{\\sqrt{2} \\epsilon_{33}^{T}}\n$$\nConversely, the current amplitude through the load is $\\hat{I}_L = \\frac{\\hat{V}_L}{R_{L,\\text{opt}}}$:\n$$\n\\hat{I}_L = \\frac{|d_{3i}| T_{\\max} t}{\\sqrt{2} \\epsilon_{33}^{T}} \\left( \\frac{\\omega \\epsilon_{33}^{T} A}{t} \\right) = \\frac{|d_{3i}| T_{\\max} \\omega A}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nFor a fixed volume $V=At$, we have $A=V/t$. So $\\hat{I}_L \\propto 1/t$ and $\\hat{V}_L \\propto t$.\n\nThis reveals the core trade-off:\n- A thick, small-area device (large $t$, small $A$) acts as a high-voltage, low-current source and requires a high-impedance load ($R_{L, \\text{opt}} \\propto t^2$).\n- A thin, large-area device (small $t$, large $A$) acts as a low-voltage, high-current source and requires a low-impedance load.\n\nThe choice between $d_{31}$ and $d_{33}$ operation is primarily dictated by the nature of the available mechanical input (e.g., in-plane stretching for $d_{31}$ vs. normal compression for $d_{33}$). Once a mode is selected, the device geometry must be tuned to match its output impedance to the electrical load for maximum power transfer, even though the theoretical maximum power density is fixed by the material properties and operating conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{d_{33}}{d_{31}}\\right)^2}\n$$", "id": "3522420"}]}
