We adopt the convention that stress, pressure, and strain are positive in compression.\nThe general relationship is:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = C_{1} \\Delta\\sigma_v - C_{2} \\Delta p_f $$\nThe coefficients $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ can be determined from two canonical experiments.\n\n1.  **Drained Hydrostatic Test**: The sample is jacketed and connected to a fluid reservoir at constant pressure, so $\\Delta p_f=0$. A hydrostatic stress $\\Delta\\sigma_v$ is applied. The drained bulk modulus $K_d$ is defined as $K_d = \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma_v}{\\Delta\\epsilon_v}$.\n    From the general relationship with $\\Delta p_f=0$, we have $\\Delta\\epsilon_v = C_{1} \\Delta\\sigma_v$.\n    Comparing with the definition of $K_d$, we find $C_{1} = \\frac{1}{K_d}$.\n\n2.  **Unjacketed Test**: The unjacketed sample is submerged in a pressurized fluid, such that the applied hydrostatic stress and the pore pressure are increased by the same amount, i.e., $\\Delta\\sigma_v = \\Delta p_f$. In this case, the porous skeleton does not feel any stress change, and the bulk volume change is solely due to the uniform compression of the solid grains. The solid grain bulk modulus $K_s$ relates the applied pressure to the volumetric strain of the solid material, and thus to the bulk material.\n    The definition is $K_s = \\frac{\\Delta p_f}{\\Delta\\epsilon_v}$.\n    From the general relationship with $\\Delta\\sigma_v = \\Delta p_f$, we have $\\Delta\\epsilon_v = (C_{1} - C_{2}) \\Delta p_f$.\n    Comparing with the definition of $K_s$, we find $C_{1} - C_{2} = \\frac{1}{K_s}$.\n\nWe can now solve for $C_{2}$:\n$$ C_{2} = C_{1} - \\frac{1}{K_s} = \\frac{1}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_s} $$\nSubstituting the coefficients back into the general relationship:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} \\Delta\\sigma_v - \\left(\\frac{1}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_s}\\right) \\Delta p_f $$\nThis is the fundamental constitutive law for the volumetric strain. Biot's theory introduces an effective stress, $\\Delta\\sigma'_v = \\Delta\\sigma_v - \\alpha\\Delta p_f$, which governs the deformation of the porous skeleton. The constitutive law is written in terms of this effective stress as:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} \\Delta\\sigma'_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (\\Delta\\sigma_v - \\alpha\\Delta p_f) $$\nComparing this form with the one we derived, we identify the coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{K_d} = \\frac{1}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_s} \\implies \\alpha = K_d \\left(\\frac{1}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_s}\\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} $$\n\n**Derivation of the Biot Modulus, $M$**\n\nThe Biot modulus $M$ appears in the second constitutive relation, which links the increment of fluid content $\\Delta\\zeta$ to the state variables. An expression for $M$ can be derived by considering the conservation of mass within a representative elementary volume. A common and robust way to define $M$ is through the fluid storage equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha - \\phi}{K_s} $$\nThis expression arises from considering the change in fluid mass stored in the pore space due to the compressibility of the fluid (term with $K_f$) and the compressibility of the solid grains (term with $K_s$). It is a fundamental result from the microscopic definition of the poroelastic parameters.\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nGiven data: $K_{d} = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $K_{s} = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $K_{f} = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\phi = 0.25$.\n\n1.  **Calculate $\\alpha$**:\n    $$ \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} = 1 - \\frac{6.5}{36} \\approx 1 - 0.180556 = 0.819444... $$\n\n2.  **Calculate $M$**:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha - \\phi}{K_s} = \\frac{0.25}{2.2} + \\frac{0.819444... - 0.25}{36} $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{M} \\approx 0.113636... + \\frac{0.569444...}{36} \\approx 0.113636... + 0.015818... = 0.129454... \\,\\, \\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} $$\n    $$ M = \\frac{1}{0.129454...} \\approx 7.7247... \\,\\, \\mathrm{GPa} $$\n\n**Thermodynamic Admissibility Check**\n\nTo be thermodynamically admissible, the material's stored energy function must be positive definite.

The condition is satisfied.\n\n2.  **$M > 0$**:\n    We calculated $M \\approx 7.725\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$. For $M$ to be positive, $1/M$ must be positive.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha-\\phi}{K_s} $$\n    Given that $\\phi, K_f, K_s$ are all positive, the term $\\phi/K_f$ is positive. Also, $\\alpha - \\phi \\approx 0.819 - 0.25 = 0.569 > 0$. Thus, the second term $(\\alpha-\\phi)/K_s$ is also positive. The sum of two positive terms is positive, so $M>0$.

We can analyze the response by considering volumetric quantities. Taking the trace of the first constitutive equation gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = (3\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) - 3\\alpha \\Delta p $$\nThe term $3\\lambda + 2\\mu$ is equal to $3K_{dr}$, where $K_{dr}$ is the drained bulk modulus of the solid skeleton. The drained bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ as $K_{dr} = \\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)}$.\nThe equation for the trace becomes:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 3K_{dr}\\Delta\\epsilon_v - 3\\alpha \\Delta p $$\nThe problem states that a uniform hydrostatic compressive stress of magnitude $\\Delta s$ is applied, so $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -\\Delta s\\,\\mathbf{I}$.
