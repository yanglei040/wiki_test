It presents a standard problem in one-dimensional thermoelasticity.\n\nThe derivation of the final axial stress proceeds from fundamental principles of continuum mechanics.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of additive strain decomposition for small strains. The total axial strain $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ at any point in the process is the sum of the mechanical strain $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}$ and the thermal strain $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}(T) + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)\n$$\nThe problem states that the bar is perfectly constrained at both ends, which means its total axial displacement is zero.

Substituting this into the previous relation, we obtain an expression for the mechanical strain as a function of temperature:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}(T) = - \\int_{T_0}^{T} \\alpha(\\theta)\\,d\\theta\n$$\nThe axial Cauchy stress $\\sigma(T)$ is related to the mechanical strain via the given uniaxial constitutive relation, which accounts for a temperature-dependent Young’s modulus $E(T)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(T) = E(T)\\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}(T)\n$$\nThis relation states that the stress at a given temperature $T$ is determined by the mechanical strain and the material's stiffness at that same temperature $T$. To find the final axial stress $\\sigma(T_1)$ at the final temperature $T_1$, we evaluate the above expressions at $T=T_1$:\n$$\n\\sigma(T_1) = E(T_1)\\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}(T_1)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the mechanical strain at $T_1$:\n$$\n\\sigma(T_1) = E(T_1) \\left( - \\int_{T_0}^{T_1} \\alpha(\\theta)\\,d\\theta \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression for the axial stress in the thermoelastic case:\n$$\n\\sigma(T_1) = -E(T_1) \\int_{T_0}^{T_1} \\alpha(\\theta)\\,d\\theta\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that a compressive stress develops, which is expected as the material's tendency to expand upon heating is resisted by the fixed constraints.\n\nDiscussion on Altered Material Behavior:\n\nIf the material behaves as a linear thermoviscoelastic solid, the constitutive relationship is fundamentally altered. The stress at a given time is no longer a simple function of the current strain but depends on the entire history of strain. The constitutive law takes the form of a hereditary integral. For a thermorheologically simple material, this is often expressed using a reduced time variable $\\xi(t) = \\int_0^t [a_T(T(\\tau))]^{-1} d\\tau$, where $a_T$ is a temperature-dependent shift factor. The stress at the final time $t_f$ (corresponding to temperature $T_1$) would be given by:\n$$\n\\sigma(t_f) = \\int_0^{t_f} E_R(\\xi(t_f) - \\xi(t')) \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mech}}(t')}{dt'} dt'\n$$\nwhere $E_R$ is the relaxation modulus. Since $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{mech}} = -\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{th}} = -\\alpha(T)\\dot{T}$, the stress becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma(t_f) = -\\int_0^{t_f} E_R(\\xi(t_f) - \\xi(t')) \\alpha(T(t')) \\dot{T}(t') dt'\n$$\nThe key structural change is that the final stress is now path-dependent; it depends on the temperature history $T(t)$ and the rate of heating $\\dot{T}$, not just the initial and final temperatures.\n\nIf the material exhibits thermoplasticity, the model must be augmented with a yield criterion and a flow rule. The total strain is decomposed into elastic, plastic, and thermal parts: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{e}} + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{p}} + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The material responds elastically as long as the stress magnitude $|\\sigma|$ is less than the temperature-dependent yield stress $Y(T)$. If the compressive stress reaches the yield limit, i.e., $|\\sigma(T)| = Y(T)$, plastic deformation initiates. Let $T_y$ be the temperature at which yielding begins, defined by $E(T_y) \\int_{T_0}^{T_y} \\alpha(\\theta)d\\theta = Y(T_y)$. For any subsequent temperature $T > T_y$ during monotonic heating, the stress state is constrained to evolve on the yield surface, meaning $|\\sigma(T)| = Y(T)$. Assuming a typical scenario where the yield stress decreases with temperature, the final stress would be $\\sigma(T_1) = -Y(T_1)$ if $T_y  T_1$. If yielding never occurs (i.e., $|-E(T) \\int_{T_0}^T \\alpha(\\theta)d\\theta|  Y(T)$ for all $T \\in [T_0, T_1]$), the final stress is identical to the purely elastic solution. The structural change is the introduction of a yield surface that bounds the elastic stress domain, and the final stress state depends on whether this boundary is reached.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-E(T_1) \\int_{T_0}^{T_1} \\alpha(\\theta)\\,d\\theta}\n$$", "id": "3529203"}, {"introduction": "Real-world thermal loads are rarely uniform.

Per the additive decomposition $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{e} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{th}$, the elastic trial step assumes the entire increment is elastic, after accounting for thermal expansion.\n\nThe thermal strain increment is $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{th} = \\alpha_0 \\, \\Delta T \\, \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n\nThe elastic trial strain, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{e, \\text{trial}}$, is the portion of the total strain that would cause stress if the response were purely elastic:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{e, \\text{trial}} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p_n - \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{th} = \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\boldsymbol{0} - \\alpha_0 \\Delta T \\mathbf{I}\n$$\n\nThe trial stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}}$, is computed using Hooke's law with the material properties at $T_{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}} = \\lambda(T_{n+1}) \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{e, \\text{trial}}) \\mathbf{I} + 2 G(T_{n+1}) \\text{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{e, \\text{trial}})\n$$\nwhere $\\text{tr}(\\cdot)$ and $\\text{dev}(\\cdot)$ are the trace and deviatoric operators, respectively. The deviatoric part of the trial stress is $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} = 2 G(T_{n+1}) \\text{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{e, \\text{trial}})$.\n\n### 3. Yield Criterion Check\n\nThe von Mises equivalent stress for the trial state, $q^{\\text{trial}}$, is calculated from the deviatoric trial stress $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}}$:\n$$\nq^{\\text{trial}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}}:\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\lVert \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} \\rVert_F\n$$\nwhere $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm.\n\nThe trial yield function, $f^{\\text{trial}}$, is evaluated:\n$$\nf^{\\text{trial}} = q^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y0}(T_{n+1}) - H \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n\n$$\nSince each case starts from a plastically undeformed state, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n = 0$, the check simplifies to:\n$$\nf^{\\text{trial}} = q^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y0}(T_{n+1})\n$$\n\n### 4. State Update\n\nThere are two possibilities based on the value of $f^{\\text{trial}}$.\n\n**Case A: Elastic Response ($f^{\\text{trial}} \\le 0$)**\nIf the trial stress is within or on the yield surface, the step is purely elastic. The final stress state is the trial state, and there is no plastic strain development.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{trial}}, \\quad q_{n+1} = q^{\\text{trial}}, \\quad \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1} = \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n = 0\n$$\n\n**Case B: Plastic Response ($f^{\\text{trial}}  0$)**\nIf the trial stress is outside the yield surface, plastic deformation occurs. A backward-Euler return-mapping algorithm is used to bring the stress state back to the updated yield surface. The problem specifies a set of update rules which we must use to derive the plastic correction.\n\nThe final state $(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}, \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1})$ must satisfy the consistency condition, $f_{n+1} = 0$:\n$$\nf_{n+1} = q_{n+1} - \\sigma_{y0}(T_{n+1}) - H \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1} = 0\n$$\nThe accumulated plastic strain is updated as $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1} = \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n + \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p = \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p$. The problem provides the following kinematic relations for the plastic multiplier $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\Delta\\gamma\n$$\n$$\nq_{n+1} = q^{\\text{trial}} - 2 G(T_{n+1}) \\Delta\\gamma\n$$\nSubstituting these into the consistency condition gives an equation for the unknown $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$\n(q^{\\text{trial}} - 2 G(T_{n+1}) \\Delta\\gamma) - \\sigma_{y0}(T_{n+1}) - H \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\Delta\\gamma\\right) = 0\n$$\nGrouping terms with $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$\nq^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y0}(T_{n+1}) = \\left(2 G(T_{n+1}) + H \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\right) \\Delta\\gamma\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the trial yield function, $f^{\\text{trial}}$. Solving for $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\gamma = \\frac{f^{\\text{trial}}}{2 G(T_{n+1}) + H \\sqrt{2/3}}\n$$\nWith $\\Delta\\gamma$ determined, the final von Mises equivalent stress $q_{n+1}$ is computed by substituting this back into the update equation:\n$$\nq_{n+1} = q^{\\text{trial}} - 2 G(T_{n+1}) \\left( \\frac{f^{\\text{trial}}}{2 G(T_{n+1}) + H \\sqrt{2/3}} \\right)\n$$\nThe plastic flow is isochoric, so the hydrostatic part of the stress is unaffected by the plastic correction. The deviatoric stress is returned radially to the new yield surface: $\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} (q_{n+1} / q^{\\text{trial}})$. The final required quantity is $q_{n+1}$.\n\nThis algorithmic framework will be implemented and applied to each of the specified test cases.", "answer": "[16.154, 404.977, 0.000, 400.000, 335.192]", "id": "3529213"}]}
