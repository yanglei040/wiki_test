A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe temperature distribution $T(x)$ within the solid slab ($0 < x < L$) is governed by the one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction equation with no heat generation. This is derived from the principle of conservation of energy. For a constant thermal conductivity $k_s$, the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nIntegrating this ordinary differential equation twice with respect to $x$ yields the general solution for the temperature profile:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = C_1 $$\n$$ T(x) = C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration that must be determined from the boundary conditions.\n\nWe have two boundary conditions:\n1.  At the right face of the slab, $x=L$, the temperature is fixed at $T_L$:\n    $$ T(L) = T_L $$\n    Substituting this into the general solution gives our first equation:\n    $$ T_L = C_1 L + C_2 \\quad (\\text{Eq. 1}) $$\n\n2.  At the fluid-solid interface, $x=0$, the heat flux due to convection from the ambient fluid must equal the heat flux conducted into the solid. This is an energy balance at the interface.\n    -   The convective heat flux from the fluid at $T_{\\infty}$ to the surface at $T(0)$ is given by Newton's law of cooling: $q''_{\\text{conv}} = h(T_{\\infty} - T(0))$.\n    -   The conductive heat flux is given by Fourier's law: $q''_{\\text{cond}} = -k_s \\frac{dT}{dx}$.\n    -   The problem defines the heat flux $q''$ as positive into the solid. Therefore, at $x=0$, the flux into the solid is $q'' = -k_s \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0}$.\n    -   Equating the convective and conductive fluxes at the interface:\n    $$ h(T_{\\infty} - T(0)) = -k_s \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} $$\n    From our general solution, we have $T(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = C_2$ and $\\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x=0} = C_1$. Substituting these into the energy balance gives our second equation:\n    $$ h(T_{\\infty} - C_2) = -k_s C_1 \\quad (\\text{Eq. 2}) $$\n\nNow we solve the system of two linear equations (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2) for $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nFrom Eq. 2, we can express $C_1$ in terms of $C_2$:\n$$ C_1 = -\\frac{h}{k_s}(T_{\\infty} - C_2) = \\frac{h}{k_s}(C_2 - T_{\\infty}) $$\nSubstitute this expression for $C_1$ into Eq. 1:\n$$ T_L = \\left( \\frac{h}{k_s}(C_2 - T_{\\infty}) \\right)L + C_2 $$\nNow, we solve for $C_2$.\n$$ T_L = \\frac{hL}{k_s} C_2 - \\frac{hL}{k_s} T_{\\infty} + C_2 $$\n$$ T_L + \\frac{hL}{k_s} T_{\\infty} = C_2 \\left( \\frac{hL}{k_s} + 1 \\right) $$\nTo clear the denominator $k_s$, multiply both sides by $k_s$:\n$$ k_s T_L + hL T_{\\infty} = C_2 (hL + k_s) $$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{hL T_{\\infty} + k_s T_L}{hL + k_s} $$\nBy definition, the interfacial temperature is $T_0 = T(0)$, and we found that $T(0) = C_2$. Therefore, the expression for the interfacial temperature is:\n$$ T_0 = \\frac{hL T_{\\infty} + k_s T_L}{hL + k_s} $$\n\nNext, we find the steady heat flux $q''$ into the solid. Since the heat transfer is 1D and steady with no internal generation, the heat flux is constant for all $x$ in the domain $0 < x < L$. The flux is given by $q'' = -k_s \\frac{dT}{dx}$. Since $\\frac{dT}{dx} = C_1$, we have $q'' = -k_s C_1$.\nUsing our expression for $C_1$ in terms of $C_2$:\n$$ q'' = -k_s \\left( \\frac{h}{k_s}(C_2 - T_{\\infty}) \\right) = -h(C_2 - T_{\\infty}) = h(T_{\\infty} - C_2) $$\nThis confirms that the flux into the solid is equal to the convective flux, as expected from the energy balance. Now substitute the derived expression for $C_2 = T_0$:\n$$ q'' = h \\left( T_{\\infty} - \\frac{hL T_{\\infty} + k_s T_L}{hL + k_s} \\right) $$\nPlace the terms over a common denominator:\n$$ q'' = h \\left( \\frac{T_{\\infty}(hL + k_s) - (hL T_{\\infty} + k_s T_L)}{hL + k_s} \\right) $$\n$$ q'' = h \\left( \\frac{hL T_{\\infty} + k_s T_{\\infty} - hL T_{\\infty} - k_s T_L}{hL + k_s} \\right) $$\n$$ q'' = h \\left( \\frac{k_s T_{\\infty} - k_s T_L}{hL + k_s} \\right) $$\n$$ q'' = \\frac{h k_s (T_{\\infty} - T_L)}{hL + k_s} $$\n\nThe derived expressions for $T_0$ and $q''$ are solely in terms of the given parameters $h$, $k_s$, $L$, $T_{\\infty}$, and $T_L$.\nThe final result is the pair of expressions for the interfacial temperature $T_0$ and the heat flux $q''$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{h L T_{\\infty} + k_s T_L}{h L + k_s} & \\frac{h k_s (T_{\\infty} - T_L)}{h L + k_s} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "3498692"}, {"introduction": "While analytical solutions are invaluable, most real-world CHT problems require numerical simulation, often using partitioned schemes that solve the fluid and solid domains separately.

The general solution for the temperature profile $T_{s}(x)$ is linear:\n$$\nT_{s}(x) = C_{1}x + C_{2}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for the solid subproblem at iteration $n$ are $T_{s}(0) = T_{L}$ and $T_{s}(L_{s}) = T_{I}^{(n)}$. Applying these conditions:\n- At $x=0$: $T_{s}(0) = C_{1}(0) + C_{2} = T_{L} \\implies C_{2} = T_{L}$.\n- At $x=L_{s}$: $T_{s}(L_{s}) = C_{1}L_{s} + T_{L} = T_{I}^{(n)} \\implies C_{1} = \\frac{T_{I}^{(n)} - T_{L}}{L_{s}}$.\n\nThe temperature distribution in the solid is thus:\n$$\nT_{s}(x) = \\left( \\frac{T_{I}^{(n)} - T_{L}}{L_{s}} \\right) x + T_{L}\n$$\nThe heat flux $q^{(n)}$ at the interface $x=L_{s}$ is defined as positive from left to right.

The solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the reduced-order model begins by expressing the governing equations in terms of the shifted temperatures $\\theta_s(y,t)$ and $\\theta_f(t)$. The solid heat conduction equation becomes\n$$\n\\rho_s c_s \\frac{\\partial \\theta_s}{\\partial t} = k_s \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_s}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nsubject to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition $\\theta_s(L_s,t) = 0$ and the convective boundary condition at the interface $y=0$:\n$$\n-k_s \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\theta_s}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0} = h \\left(\\theta_s(0,t) - \\theta_f(t)\\right)\n$$\nTo derive the reduced-order model for the solid, we perform a Galerkin projection. The weak form of the equation is obtained by multiplying by a test function $\\phi_k(y)$ and integrating over the domain $y \\in [0, L_s]$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L_s} \\rho_s c_s \\frac{\\partial \\theta_s}{\\partial t} \\phi_k(y) dy = \\int_{0}^{L_s} k_s \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_s}{\\partial y^2} \\phi_k(y) dy\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts to the right-hand side term and incorporate the boundary conditions:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L_s} k_s \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_s}{\\partial y^2} \\phi_k(y) dy = \\left[ k_s \\frac{\\partial \\theta_s}{\\partial y} \\phi_k(y) \\right]_0^{L_s} - \\int_{0}^{L_s} k_s \\frac{\\partial \\theta_s}{\\partial y} \\frac{d\\phi_k}{dy} dy\n$$\nThe boundary term at $y=L_s$ is zero because $\\phi_k(L_s)=0$. At $y=0$, we have $-k_s \\frac{\\partial\\theta_s}{\\partial y}(0,t) \\phi_k(0)$. Using the convective BC and $\\phi_k(0)=1$, this term becomes $-h(\\theta_s(0,t) - \\theta_f(t))$. The weak form is thus:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L_s} \\rho_s c_s \\frac{\\partial \\theta_s}{\\partial t} \\phi_k dy = -h \\left(\\theta_s(0,t) - \\theta_f(t)\\right) - \\int_{0}^{L_s} k_s \\frac{\\partial \\theta_s}{\\partial y} \\frac{d\\phi_k}{dy} dy\n$$\nNext, we substitute the series representation $\\theta_s(y,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n(t) \\phi_n(y)$ into this equation:\n$$\n\\rho_s c_s \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} \\frac{da_n}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L_s} \\phi_n \\phi_k dy = -h \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n \\phi_n(0) - \\theta_f \\right) - k_s \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n \\int_{0}^{L_s} \\frac{d\\phi_n}{dy} \\frac{d\\phi_k}{dy} dy\n$$\nThe basis functions are orthogonal on $[0, L_s]$. We compute the inner products (mass and stiffness matrices):\n$M_{kk} = \\int_0^{L_s} \\cos^2(\\mu_k y) dy = \\frac{L_s}{2}$ and $K_{kk} = \\int_0^{L_s} (\\frac{d\\phi_k}{dy})^2 dy = \\frac{\\mu_k^2 L_s}{2}$.\nUsing these orthogonality properties and noting $\\phi_n(0)=1$, the projected equation for each mode $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho_s c_s \\frac{da_k}{dt} \\left(\\frac{L_s}{2}\\right) = -h \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n - \\theta_f \\right) - k_s a_k \\left(\\frac{\\mu_k^2 L_s}{2}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging to find the time derivative of the modal coefficient $a_k$:\n$$\n\\frac{da_k}{dt} = - \\frac{k_s}{\\rho_s c_s} \\mu_k^2 a_k - \\frac{2h}{\\rho_s c_s L_s} \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n + \\frac{2h}{\\rho_s c_s L_s} \\theta_f\n$$\nLet $\\alpha_s = k_s/(\\rho_s c_s)$ be the thermal diffusivity of the solid and $C_s = 2h/(\\rho_s c_s L_s)$. The set of $m$ equations becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{da_k}{dt} = -\\alpha_s \\mu_k^2 a_k - C_s \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n + C_s \\theta_f, \\quad k=0, \\ldots, m-1\n$$\nThe fluid energy balance is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_f}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_f} \\theta_f - \\gamma \\left(\\theta_f - \\theta_s(0,t)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\theta_s(0,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n(t)\\phi_n(0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n(t)$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_f}{dt} = \\gamma \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} a_n - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_f} + \\gamma\\right) \\theta_f\n$$\nWe now assemble the full linear system $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}$ with the state vector $\\mathbf{x} = [a_0, \\dots, a_{m-1}, \\theta_f]^T$. The $(m+1) \\times (m+1)$ system matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ has the following structure:\nFor the first $m$ rows, corresponding to $da_k/dt$ where $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$:\n-   $A_{k,n} = -C_s$ for $n \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$ and $n \\neq k$.\n-   $A_{k,k} = -\\alpha_s \\mu_k^2 - C_s$.\n-   $A_{k,m} = C_s$. This is the coefficient of $\\theta_f$.\n\nFor the last row ($m$), corresponding to $d\\theta_f/dt$:\n-   $A_{m,n} = \\gamma$ for $n \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$. These are the coefficients of the $a_n$.\n-   $A_{m,m} = -(\\frac{1}{\\tau_f} + \\gamma)$. This is the coefficient of $\\theta_f$.\n\nThe stability of this linear time-invariant system is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. The spectral abscissa, defined as $\\sigma(\\mathbf{A}) = \\max_{i} \\{\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i)\\}$, where $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$ are the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$, provides a quantitative measure of stability. A negative spectral abscissa indicates that all modes decay, and the system is stable. The task is to compute this value for given sets of parameters. The parameters $h$, $\\gamma$, and $\\tau_f$ depend on the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, which must be computed for each test case.\nThe calculation proceeds by first determining the physical parameters $u$, $\\tau_f$, $k_f$, $Nu$, $h$, $\\gamma$, and $C_s$ for each test case. Then, the system matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is constructed, and its eigenvalues are computed numerically. The maximum of the real parts of these eigenvalues is the required spectral abscissa.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and solves a reduced-order model for conjugate heat transfer\n    in a fin array, then computes the spectral abscissa for stability analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Physical Parameters (SI units) ---\n    # Solid properties (Aluminum)\n    L_s = 2e-3  # m, fin thickness\n    k_s = 205.0  # W/(m K), thermal conductivity\n    rho_s = 2700.0  # kg/m^3, density\n    c_s = 900.0  # J/(kg K), specific heat capacity\n    alpha_s = k_s / (rho_s * c_s)  # m^2/s, thermal diffusivity\n\n    # Fluid properties (Water-like)\n    rho_f = 1000.0  # kg/m^3, density\n    c_f = 4181.0  # J/(kg K), specific heat capacity\n    mu_f = 1.0e-3  # Pa s, dynamic viscosity\n    nu_f = mu_f / rho_f  # m^2/s, kinematic viscosity\n\n    # Geometric parameters\n    D_h = 1.0e-2  # m, hydraulic diameter\n    L_c = 1.0e-1  # m, characteristic length of fluid control volume\n    As_Vf_ratio = 800.0  # m^-1, fin surface area to fluid volume ratio\n\n    # --- Test Cases ---\n    test_cases = [\n        (1, 15000, 7.0),\n        (3, 40000, 3.0),\n        (5, 200000, 0.7),\n        (3, 10000, 10.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for m, Re, Pr in test_cases:\n        # --- 1.
