The interface between the two fluids is smooth and carries a constant isotropic surface tension $\\gamma$. There are no body forces, temperature gradients, or surfactant effects, and the interface is free of mass transfer.

The derivation must be based on the conservation of linear momentum.\n\nLet us begin by applying the principle of conservation of linear momentum to a control volume that straddles the interface between the droplet fluid (phase '$+$') and the ambient fluid (phase '$-$'). For a system in a static equilibrium state with no body forces, the integral form of the momentum equation dictates that the sum of all surface forces acting on any control volume must be zero.\n\nWe construct a small \"pillbox\" control volume that is aligned with the local normal to the interface, $\\boldsymbol{n}$, and bisected by the interface. Let this pillbox be a cylinder of small height $h$ and small base area $\\delta A$. The top cap of the cylinder lies in the droplet fluid ($+$) and the bottom cap lies in the ambient fluid ($-$). As we consider the limit where the height $h \\to 0$, the forces acting on the side walls of the pillbox become negligible compared to the forces on the top and bottom caps. The remaining forces to be balanced are the pressure forces on the top and bottom caps and the surface tension force acting on the perimeter where the interface intersects the pillbox's side wall.\n\nLet's orient our coordinate system such that the normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ at the center of our pillbox points in the $z$-direction. The forces acting on the fluid within the control volume in the $\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction are:\n$1$. The force on the top cap at $z>0$ due to the pressure $p^{+}$ of the interior fluid. This force is $F_{top} = -p^{+} \\delta A$. The negative sign indicates the force acts in the $-\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction (pressure is compressive).\n$2$. The force on the bottom cap at $z<0$ due to the pressure $p^{-}$ of the exterior fluid. This force is $F_{bot} = p^{-} \\delta A$. This force acts in the $+\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction.\n$3$. The force due to surface tension, $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\gamma}$. This force acts on the perimeter of the interface, which is a circle for our pillbox cutting through the spherical droplet. The surface tension $\\gamma$ exerts a force tangential to the surface. Due to the curvature of the interface, the sum of these tangential forces around the perimeter results in a net force component along the normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This net force pulls the surface inward, toward its center of curvature.\nFor a spherical droplet of radius $R$, the center of curvature is the center of the sphere. The normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is defined as pointing from the ambient fluid to the droplet interior, hence it points towards the center of curvature. The surface tension force on the fluid within the control volume is therefore directed along $\\boldsymbol{n}$.\n\nTo calculate this force, consider a small spherical cap defined by a small angle $\\alpha$ from the pole. The radius of the perimeter circle is $r_{cap} = R \\sin\\alpha$. The total tension along this perimeter is $\\gamma (2\\pi r_{cap})$. This force is directed tangentially to the surface, making an angle $\\alpha$ with the plane perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{n}$. The component of this force in the direction of $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is $(\\gamma 2\\pi R \\sin\\alpha)\\sin\\alpha$. The area of the control volume cap, projected onto the plane normal to $\\boldsymbol{n}$, is $\\delta A = \\pi r_{cap}^2 = \\pi (R\\sin\\alpha)^2 = \\pi R^2 \\sin^2\\alpha$.\nThus, the surface tension force is $F_{\\gamma} = 2\\pi\\gamma R \\sin^2\\alpha = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} (\\pi R^2 \\sin^2\\alpha) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} \\delta A$. This force acts in the $+\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction.\n\nThe force balance equation for the fluid in the pillbox, in the $\\boldsymbol{n}$ direction, is:\n$$\nF_{top} + F_{bot} + F_{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$\n-p^{+} \\delta A + p^{-} \\delta A + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} \\delta A = 0\n$$\nDividing by the area $\\delta A$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n-p^{+} + p^{-} + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\np^{+} - p^{-} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nUsing the problem's definition of the pressure jump, $[p] = p^{+} - p^{-}$, we obtain the first required expression:\n$$\n[p] = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nThis is the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical interface.\n\nThe problem also asks for the interfacial jump relation for the normal stress. The normal stress, $\\sigma_{nn}$, on a surface with normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is given by $\\sigma_{nn} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the total stress tensor. For a static incompressible Newtonian fluid, the velocity field is zero, so the viscous stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is zero. The total stress tensor is purely isotropic: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\boldsymbol{I}$, where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity tensor.\nThe jump in normal stress is $[\\sigma_{nn}] = \\sigma_{nn}^{+} - \\sigma_{nn}^{-}$. Let us compute each term:\n$\\sigma_{nn}^{+} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{+} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot (-p^{+}\\boldsymbol{I}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = -p^{+}(\\boldsymbol{n}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}) = -p^{+}$.\n$\\sigma_{nn}^{-} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{-} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot (-p^{-}\\boldsymbol{I}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = -p^{-}(\\boldsymbol{n}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}) = -p^{-}$.\nTherefore, the jump in normal stress is:\n$$\n[\\sigma_{nn}] = (-p^{+}) - (-p^{-}) = p^{-} - p^{+} = -(p^{+} - p^{-}) = -[p]\n$$\nThe mean curvature $H$ of a sphere of radius $R$ is given by $H = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R}) = \\frac{1}{R}$.\nWe can express our result for the pressure jump in terms of the mean curvature: $[p] = 2\\gamma H$.\nCombining this with the relation $[\\sigma_{nn}] = -[p]$, we find the interfacial jump relation for the normal stress:\n$$\n[\\sigma_{nn}] = -2\\gamma H = -\\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nThis relation states that the jump in normal stress across the interface is balanced by the force induced by surface tension and curvature.\n\nFinally, we must determine the limit of the pressure jump $[p]$ as the radius $R$ approaches infinity. This corresponds physically to a flat interface.\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} [p] = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nSince the surface tension $\\gamma$ is a constant, as $R \\to \\infty$, the denominator becomes infinitely large, and the expression approaches zero.\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} [p] = 0\n$$\nThis confirms the physical intuition that there is no pressure jump across a flat interface in the absence of other effects.\n\nThe problem asks for a two-entry row matrix containing the analytic expression for $[p]$ and the value of its limit as $R \\to \\infty$. The two entries are $\\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$ and $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2\\gamma}{R} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3510796"}, {"introduction": "Interface conditions are not limited to static phenomena; they are critical for understanding dynamic processes like wave propagation across material boundaries.

Wave Fields and Impedance Relations**\n\nWe begin by defining the wave fields in the fluid ($x<0$) and the solid ($x>0$). All fields are assumed to have a harmonic time dependence of the form $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\n**1.1. Fluid Medium ($x<0$)**\nIn the inviscid, compressible fluid, the acoustic field is a superposition of an incident wave propagating in the $+x$ direction and a reflected wave propagating in the $-x$ direction.\n\nThe incident pressure $p_i$ and normal particle velocity $v_{f,i}$ are given by:\n$$ p_i(x,t) = \\hat{p}_i \\exp\\big(i(k_f x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\n$$ v_{f,i}(x,t) = \\hat{v}_{f,i} \\exp\\big(i(k_f x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\nHere, $\\hat{p}_i$ and $\\hat{v}_{f,i}$ are the complex amplitudes, and $k_f = \\omega/c_f$ is the fluid acoustic wavenumber, where $c_f$ is the sound speed. The relationship between pressure and velocity amplitudes is derived from the linearized one-dimensional Euler's (momentum) equation, $\\rho_f \\frac{\\partial v_f}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial p_f}{\\partial x}$. Substituting the wave forms yields:\n$$ \\rho_f (-i\\omega) \\hat{v}_{f,i} = -(ik_f) \\hat{p}_i \\implies \\hat{p}_i = \\frac{\\rho_f \\omega}{k_f} \\hat{v}_{f,i} = \\rho_f c_f \\hat{v}_{f,i} $$\nWe define the characteristic acoustic impedance of the fluid as $Z_f = \\rho_f c_f$, so $\\hat{p}_i = Z_f \\hat{v}_{f,i}$.\n\nThe reflected pressure $p_r$ and velocity $v_{f,r}$ propagate in the $-x$ direction:\n$$ p_r(x,t) = \\hat{p}_r \\exp\\big(i(-k_f x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\n$$ v_{f,r}(x,t) = \\hat{v}_{f,r} \\exp\\big(i(-k_f x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\nApplying the momentum equation similarly gives:\n$$ \\rho_f (-i\\omega) \\hat{v}_{f,r} = -(-ik_f) \\hat{p}_r \\implies \\hat{p}_r = -\\frac{\\rho_f \\omega}{k_f} \\hat{v}_{f,r} = -Z_f \\hat{v}_{f,r} $$\n\nThe total acoustic pressure and velocity in the fluid are $p_f = p_i + p_r$ and $v_f = v_{f,i} + v_{f,r}$, respectively.\n\n**1.2. Solid Medium ($x>0$)**\nIn the homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic solid, a normally incident acoustic wave excites only a longitudinal (compressional) wave propagating in the $+x$ direction. There is no shear wave generation. Let the displacement field in the solid be $\\mathbf{u}_s = (u_x(x,t), 0, 0)$. The transmitted velocity is $v_s = \\partial u_x / \\partial t$. We write the transmitted velocity field as:\n$$ v_{s}(x,t) = \\hat{v}_{s,t} \\exp\\big(i(k_L x - \\omega t)\\big) $$\nwhere $\\hat{v}_{s,t}$ is the complex velocity amplitude at $x=0$ and $k_L = \\omega/c_L$ is the longitudinal wavenumber in the solid. The longitudinal wave speed is given as $c_L=\\sqrt{(\\lambda+2\\mu)/\\rho_{s}}$.\n\nThe relevant stress component is the normal stress $\\sigma_{xx}$. According to Hooke's law for an isotropic solid, $\\sigma_{xx} = (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\epsilon_{xx}$, where $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\partial u_x / \\partial x$ is the normal strain.\nFrom $v_s = \\partial u_x / \\partial t$, we find $u_x(x,t) = \\frac{\\hat{v}_{s,t}}{-i\\omega} \\exp\\big(i(k_L x - \\omega t)\\big)$.\nThe strain is then $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{ik_L}{-i\\omega} \\hat{v}_{s,t} \\exp\\big(i(k_L x - \\omega t)\\big) = \\frac{k_L}{\\omega} v_s(x,t) = \\frac{1}{c_L} v_s(x,t)$.\nThe stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ is thus:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(x,t) = (\\lambda + 2\\mu) \\frac{1}{c_L} v_s(x,t) $$\nUsing $c_L^2 = (\\lambda+2\\mu)/\\rho_s$, we can write $(\\lambda+2\\mu) = \\rho_s c_L^2$.\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(x,t) = \\frac{\\rho_s c_L^2}{c_L} v_s(x,t) = \\rho_s c_L v_s(x,t) $$\nThis defines the longitudinal impedance of the solid, $Z_L = \\rho_s c_L$, such that $\\sigma_{xx} = Z_L v_s$.\n\n**2. Interface Conditions at $x=0$**\nAt the fluid-solid interface at $x=0$, we apply two continuity conditions.\n\n**2.1. Continuity of Normal Velocity**\nThe normal component of particle velocity must be continuous across the interface to prevent cavitation or material overlap.\n$$ v_f(0,t) = v_s(0,t) $$\nEvaluating the total fields at $x=0$:\n$$ v_{f,i}(0,t) + v_{f,r}(0,t) = v_s(0,t) $$\nIn terms of complex amplitudes (after dropping the common factor $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$):\n$$ \\hat{v}_{f,i} + \\hat{v}_{f,r} = \\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\nUsing the impedance relations, $\\hat{v}_{f,i} = \\hat{p}_i/Z_f$ and $\\hat{v}_{f,r} = -\\hat{p}_r/Z_f$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p}_i}{Z_f} - \\frac{\\hat{p}_r}{Z_f} = \\hat{v}_{s,t} \\quad \\quad (1) $$\n\n**2.2. Continuity of Normal Traction**\nThe normal traction (force per unit area) must be continuous across the interface, as a consequence of Newton's third law for a massless interface. This continuity requires that the pressure in the fluid equals the normal stress in the solid at the boundary. Adopting the common acoustic convention where pressure in the fluid and stress in the solid are both taken as positive in compression, this condition is written as:\n$$ p_f(0,t) = \\sigma_{xx}(0,t) $$\nEvaluating the fields at $x=0$:\n$$ p_i(0,t) + p_r(0,t) = \\sigma_{xx}(0,t) $$\nIn terms of complex amplitudes:\n$$ \\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r = Z_L \\hat{v}_{s,t} \\quad \\quad (2) $$\n\n**3. Solving for Coefficients $R$ and $T$**\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the amplitudes:\n$$ (1) \\quad \\hat{p}_i - \\hat{p}_r = Z_f \\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\n$$ (2) \\quad \\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r = Z_L \\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\n\nTo find the reflection coefficient $R = \\hat{p}_r / \\hat{p}_i$, we eliminate $\\hat{v}_{s,t}$. Dividing equation $(2)$ by equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r}{\\hat{p}_i - \\hat{p}_r} = \\frac{Z_L}{Z_f} $$\n$$ Z_f(\\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r) = Z_L(\\hat{p}_i - \\hat{p}_r) $$\n$$ Z_f \\hat{p}_i + Z_f \\hat{p}_r = Z_L \\hat{p}_i - Z_L \\hat{p}_r $$\nRearranging to solve for $\\hat{p}_r$:\n$$ \\hat{p}_r(Z_L + Z_f) = \\hat{p}_i(Z_L - Z_f) $$\n$$ R = \\frac{\\hat{p}_r}{\\hat{p}_i} = \\frac{Z_L - Z_f}{Z_L + Z_f} $$\n\nTo find the transmission coefficient $T = \\hat{v}_{s,t} / \\hat{v}_{f,i}$, we solve the system for $\\hat{v}_{s,t}$. Add equations $(1)$ and $(2)$:\n$$ (\\hat{p}_i - \\hat{p}_r) + (\\hat{p}_i + \\hat{p}_r) = (Z_f + Z_L)\\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\n$$ 2\\hat{p}_i = (Z_L + Z_f)\\hat{v}_{s,t} $$\n$$ \\hat{v}_{s,t} = \\frac{2\\hat{p}_i}{Z_L + Z_f} $$\nThe transmission coefficient is defined as the ratio of velocity amplitudes, $T = \\hat{v}_{s,t} / \\hat{v}_{f,i}$. Using $\\hat{p}_i = Z_f \\hat{v}_{f,i}$:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{\\hat{v}_{f,i}} \\left(\\frac{2(Z_f \\hat{v}_{f,i})}{Z_L + Z_f}\\right) = \\frac{2 Z_f}{Z_L + Z_f} $$\n\n**4. Final Expressions**\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the impedances in terms of the given material properties: $\\rho_f$, $c_f$, $\\rho_s$, $\\lambda$, and $\\mu$.\n$$ Z_f = \\rho_f c_f $$\n$$ Z_L = \\rho_s c_L = \\rho_s \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda + 2\\mu}{\\rho_s}} = \\sqrt{\\rho_s (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} $$\n\nThe reflection and transmission coefficients are:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_s (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} - \\rho_f c_f}{\\sqrt{\\rho_s (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} + \\rho_f c_f} $$\n$$ T = \\frac{2 \\rho_f c_f}{\\sqrt{\\rho_s (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} + \\rho_f c_f} $$\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row matrix.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_{s} (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} - \\rho_{f} c_{f}}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{s} (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} + \\rho_{f} c_{f}} & \\frac{2 \\rho_{f} c_{f}}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{s} (\\lambda + 2\\mu)} + \\rho_{f} c_{f}} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3510832"}, {"introduction": "Bridging the gap between continuous physical laws and discrete computational models is a central challenge in multiphysics simulation.

In one dimension, this is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\epsilon \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) = 0$.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: Dirichlet conditions $\\phi(-L_1) = V_1$ and $\\phi(L_2) = V_2$.\n- **Interface Conditions (Exact/Strong Form)**:\n    1.  Potential continuity: $[\\phi] \\equiv \\phi(0^+) - \\phi(0^-) = 0$.\n    2.  Electric displacement jump: $[\\epsilon \\partial_n \\phi] \\equiv \\epsilon_2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\rvert_{x=0^+} - \\epsilon_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\rvert_{x=0^-} = \\sigma_s$.\n- **Approximation**: Piecewise linear potential.\n    -   In $\\Omega_1$: $\\phi_1(x) = a_1 x + b_1$.\n    -   In $\\Omega_2$: $\\phi_2(x) = a_2 x + b_2$.\n- **Penalty Method**: Minimize the functional $J$ subject to constraints.\n    -   Functional: $J(a_1,a_2) = \\int_{-L_1}^{0} \\epsilon_1 \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi_1}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{0}^{L_2} \\epsilon_2 \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi_2}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\left(b_2 - b_1\\right)^2$, where $\\gamma > 0$ is a penalty parameter.\n    -   Constraints:\n        1. Boundary condition: $\\phi_1(-L_1) = V_1$.\n        2. Boundary condition: $\\phi_2(L_2) = V_2$.\n        3. Flux-jump condition (strong enforcement): $\\epsilon_2 a_2 - \\epsilon_1 a_1 = \\sigma_s$.\n- **Nitsche Method**: Stated to reproduce the exact interface conditions for this 1D linear setting, implying $[\\phi] = 0$.\n- **Objective**: Derive an expression for the spurious potential jump $[\\phi] = b_2 - b_1$ for the penalty method and compute it for a given test suite. Compute the corresponding jump for the Nitsche method.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in classical electrostatics and numerical analysis methods for partial differential equations. The governing equations, boundary conditions, and interface jump relations are standard. The use of a penalty method to weakly enforce continuity is a well-established technique. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed to a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Spurious Potential Jump for the Penalty Method\n\nThe goal is to find the coefficients $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$ that minimize the functional $J$ subject to the given constraints.\nThe linear approximations for the potential are $\\phi_1(x) = a_1 x + b_1$ and $\\phi_2(x) = a_2 x + b_2$. The gradients are constant: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi_1}{\\mathrm{d}x} = a_1$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi_2}{\\mathrm{d}x} = a_2$.\n\nThe functional $J$ can be written as:\n$$J(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2) = \\epsilon_1 a_1^2 \\int_{-L_1}^{0} \\mathrm{d}x + \\epsilon_2 a_2^2 \\int_{0}^{L_2} \\mathrm{d}x + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} (b_2 - b_1)^2$$\n$$J(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2) = \\epsilon_1 a_1^2 L_1 + \\epsilon_2 a_2^2 L_2 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} (b_2 - b_1)^2$$\n\nThe constraints are used to eliminate some of the variables. The Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced strongly:\n1. $\\phi_1(-L_1) = V_1 \\implies-a_1 L_1 + b_1 = V_1 \\implies b_1 = V_1 + a_1 L_1$\n2. $\\phi_2(L_2) = V_2 \\implies a_2 L_2 + b_2 = V_2 \\implies b_2 = V_2 - a_2 L_2$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $b_1$ and $b_2$ into the functional allows us to express $J$ as a function of only $a_1$ and $a_2$. The jump term $b_2-b_1$ becomes:\n$$b_2 - b_1 = (V_2 - a_2 L_2) - (V_1 + a_1 L_1) = (V_2 - V_1) - (a_1 L_1 + a_2 L_2)$$\nThe functional to be minimized is now:\n$$J(a_1, a_2) = \\epsilon_1 a_1^2 L_1 + \\epsilon_2 a_2^2 L_2 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} ((V_2 - V_1) - (a_1 L_1 + a_2 L_2))^2$$\nThis minimization is performed subject to the strong enforcement of the flux-jump condition:\n$$g(a_1, a_2) = \\epsilon_2 a_2 - \\epsilon_1 a_1 - \\sigma_s = 0$$\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem. We employ the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$\\mathcal{L}(a_1, a_2, \\lambda) = J(a_1, a_2) - \\lambda g(a_1, a_2)$$\nThe stationary conditions are found by setting the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $a_1, a_2,$ and $\\lambda$ to zero.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial a_1} = 2 \\epsilon_1 a_1 L_1 + \\gamma ((V_2 - V_1) - (a_1 L_1 + a_2 L_2))(-L_1) + \\lambda \\epsilon_1 = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial a_2} = 2 \\epsilon_2 a_2 L_2 + \\gamma ((V_2 - V_1) - (a_1 L_1 + a_2 L_2))(-L_2) - \\lambda \\epsilon_2 = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = -(\\epsilon_2 a_2 - \\epsilon_1 a_1 - \\sigma_s) = 0$$\n\nLet $[\\phi]_p = b_2 - b_1 = (V_2 - V_1) - (a_1 L_1 + a_2 L_2)$ be the spurious potential jump from the penalty method. The first two equations can be rewritten:\n$$2 \\epsilon_1 a_1 L_1 - \\gamma L_1 [\\phi]_p + \\lambda \\epsilon_1 = 0$$\n$$2 \\epsilon_2 a_2 L_2 - \\gamma L_2 [\\phi]_p - \\lambda \\epsilon_2 = 0$$\n\nWe solve for the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ in each equation:\n$$\\lambda = -\\frac{2 \\epsilon_1 a_1 L_1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{\\gamma L_1 [\\phi]_p}{\\epsilon_1} = -2 a_1 L_1 + \\frac{\\gamma L_1}{\\epsilon_1} [\\phi]_p$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2 \\epsilon_2 a_2 L_2}{\\epsilon_2} - \\frac{\\gamma L_2 [\\phi]_p}{\\epsilon_2} = 2 a_2 L_2 - \\frac{\\gamma L_2}{\\epsilon_2} [\\phi]_p$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $\\lambda$:\n$$-2 a_1 L_1 + \\frac{\\gamma L_1}{\\epsilon_1} [\\phi]_p = 2 a_2 L_2 - \\frac{\\gamma L_2}{\\epsilon_2} [\\phi]_p$$\nRearranging to group terms with $[\\phi]_p$ and terms with $a_i$:\n$$2 a_1 L_1 + 2 a_2 L_2 = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{L_1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{L_2}{\\epsilon_2}\\right) [\\phi]_p$$\n$$a_1 L_1 + a_2 L_2 = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\left(\\frac{L_1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{L_2}{\\epsilon_2}\\right) [\\phi]_p$$\n\nNow we substitute this back into the definition of $[\\phi]_p$:\n$$[\\phi]_p = (V_2 - V_1) - \\left(a_1 L_1 + a_2 L_2\\right)$$\n$$[\\phi]_p = (V_2 - V_1) - \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\left(\\frac{L_1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{L_2}{\\epsilon_2}\\right) [\\phi]_p$$\nSolving for $[\\phi]_p$:\n$$[\\phi]_p \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\left(\\frac{L_1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{L_2}{\\epsilon_2}\\right)\\right) = V_2 - V_1$$\n$$[\\phi]_p \\left(\\frac{2 + \\gamma \\left(\\frac{L_1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{L_2}{\\epsilon_2}\\right)}{2}\\right) = V_2 - V_1$$\nThis yields the final expression for the spurious potential jump:\n$$[\\phi]_p = \\frac{2 (V_2 - V_1)}{2 + \\gamma \\left(\\frac{L_1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{L_2}{\\epsilon_2}\\right)}$$\nThis result is remarkably simple. The jump depends on the applied potential difference $V_2 - V_1$, the penalty parameter $\\gamma$, and the geometric and material properties of the subdomains, encapsulated in the terms $L_1/\\epsilon_1$ and $L_2/\\epsilon_2$ which represent electrical resistances per unit area. Notably, the jump is independent of the surface charge density $\\sigma_s$. This occurs because the penalty term in the functional only targets the potential continuity, while the flux condition is treated as a separate, hard constraint.\n\nAs a consistency check, in the limit of infinite penalty $\\gamma \\to \\infty$, the spurious jump $[\\phi]_p \\to 0$, which correctly recovers the strong enforcement of potential continuity.\n\n### Nitsche/Strong Enforcement\nThe problem text correctly states that for this one-dimensional piecewise linear problem, the symmetric Nitsche's method reproduces the exact solution, which is equivalent to strong enforcement of all interface conditions. Strong enforcement implies $[\\phi] = 0$ by definition. Therefore, for all test cases, the spurious jump for the Nitsche method is $0$.\n\n### Implementation Plan\nWe will implement a Python program that takes the parameters for each test case—$(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, L_1, L_2, V_1, V_2, \\sigma_s, \\gamma)$—and computes two values:\n1.  The penalty-induced jump $[\\phi]_p$ using the derived formula.\n2.  The Nitsche-induced jump, which is $0$.\nThe results from all test cases will be collected into a single flat list and printed.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the spurious potential jump at an electrostatic interface for two\n    different numerical enforcement schemes: Penalty and Nitsche.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple is (epsilon_1, epsilon_2, L_1, L_2, V_1, V_2, sigma_s, gamma)\n    # Units are SI: F/m, m, V, C/m^2, and gamma's units are such that the penalty\n    # term has units of energy (Joules).\n    test_cases = [\n        # (Parameter set 1)\n        (8.854e-12, 3.5416e-11, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0e-6, 1.0e2),\n        # (Parameter set 2)\n        (8.854e-12, 3.5416e-11, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-3),\n        # (Parameter set 3)\n        (8.854e-12, 3.5416e-11, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0e-6, 1.0e8),\n        # (Parameter set 4)\n        (8.854e-12, 8.854e-10, 0.01, 0.2, 0.0, 5.0, 5.0e-6, 1.0e1),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        eps1, eps2, L1, L2, V1, V2, sigma_s, gamma = case\n\n        # Calculate the spurious potential jump for the Penalty method.\n        # The derived formula is:\n        # [phi]_penalty = 2 * (V2 - V1) / (2 + gamma * (L1/eps1 + L2/eps2))\n        \n        v_diff = V2 - V1\n        \n        # The term R_eff = L1/eps1 + L2/eps2 can be seen as an effective\n        # resistance-like term for the 1D geometry.\n        resistance_term = L1 / eps1 + L2 / eps2\n        \n        denominator = 2.0 + gamma * resistance_term\n        \n        # Handle the case where the denominator might be close to zero,\n        # although physically it should be positive.\n        if denominator == 0:\n            # This case is physically not expected with gamma > 0.\n            # It would imply an infinite jump, which we represent as NaN.\n            phi_jump_penalty = np.nan\n        else:\n            phi_jump_penalty = (2.0 * v_diff) / denominator\n            \n        results.append(phi_jump_penalty)\n\n        # For the Nitsche method, as stated in the problem for this 1D\n        # piecewise linear case, it reproduces strong enforcement, so the\n        # potential jump is exactly zero.\n        phi_jump_nitsche = 0.0\n        results.append(phi_jump_nitsche)\n\n    # Format the final output as a comma-separated list of floating-point numbers\n    # enclosed in square brackets.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{r:.18e}' for r in results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3510848"}]}
