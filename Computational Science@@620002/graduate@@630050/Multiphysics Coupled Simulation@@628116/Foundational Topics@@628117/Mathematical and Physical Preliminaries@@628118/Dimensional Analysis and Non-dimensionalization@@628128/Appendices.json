Expanding along the fourth row, which consists entirely of zeros, immediately gives:\n$$\\det(A_{c}) = 0$$\nA determinant of zero confirms that the chosen repeating variables are not dimensionally independent in the context of the $4$ base dimensions. Specifically, none of the variables in $S_c$ contain the dimension of electric current $I$, which is necessary to non-dimensionalize quantities like $E$ or $\\epsilon$.\n\n#### Task 2: Formation of Dimensionless Groups with the Corrected Set $S_t$\n\nThe corrected set of repeating variables is $S_{t}=\\{\\rho, R, \\mu, E\\}$.

I will proceed with providing a complete solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the characteristic velocity scale $U$ by considering dominant balances in the vertical component of the Navier-Stokes equation. The pressure gradient term, $-\\partial p'/\\partial z$, represents the externally imposed pressure gradient. For a flow driven purely by buoyancy in a closed-bottom channel or a symmetric flow in an open channel, this term can be considered zero or is incorporated into the definition of modified pressure in a way that it does not participate in the primary force balance that sets the velocity scale, which is instead determined by the interplay of buoyancy, inertia, and viscous forces. We analyze the balance between the remaining terms.\n\nThe vertical momentum equation is:\n$$\n\\rho_{0}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\right) = \\mu \\nabla^{2} u + \\rho_{0} g \\beta \\left(T - T_{0}\\right)\n$$\nWe perform a scaling analysis by estimating the order of magnitude of each term. The characteristic scales are:\n- Velocity: $u \\sim U$\n- Transverse length (for gradients): $x \\sim L$\n- Vertical length: $z \\sim L$. It is assumed that the characteristic length scale for variations in the vertical direction is the same as the transverse scale $L$, as it is the only geometric length scale provided.\n- Time: $t \\sim t_{char}$. For the unsteady startup regime, we use the given reaction timescale, $t_{char} = \\tau$.\n- Temperature: $T - T_0 \\sim \\Delta T$\n\nBased on these scales, we estimate the magnitude of each term in the equation:\n1.  **Unsteady Term**: $\\rho_{0} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\sim \\rho_{0} \\frac{U}{t_{char}}$. For the startup regime, this is $\\rho_{0} \\frac{U}{\\tau}$.\n2.  **Inertial Term**: $\\rho_{0} u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\sim \\rho_{0} U \\frac{U}{L} = \\rho_{0} \\frac{U^2}{L}$.\n3.  **Viscous Term**: $\\mu \\nabla^{2} u = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)$. The problem states the channel is \"slender\" and \"dominant gradients of $u$ occur over the gap scale $L$\". This implies that transverse gradients are much larger than vertical gradients, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\gg \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$. Therefore, $\\nabla^2 u \\sim \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\sim \\frac{U}{L^2}$. The viscous term scales as $\\mu \\frac{U}{L^2}$.\n4.  **Buoyancy Term**: $\\rho_{0} g \\beta (T - T_{0}) \\sim \\rho_{0} g \\beta \\Delta T$.\n\nThe momentum equation scales as:\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\rho_{0} \\frac{U}{\\tau}}_{\\text{Unsteady}} + \\underbrace{\\rho_{0} \\frac{U^2}{L}}_{\\text{Inertial}} \\sim \\underbrace{\\mu \\frac{U}{L^2}}_{\\text{Viscous}} + \\underbrace{\\rho_{0} g \\beta \\Delta T}_{\\text{Buoyancy}}\n$$\nWe now analyze the three requested dominant balances.\n\n**1. Viscous–Buoyancy Balance**\nThis regime assumes that viscous and buoyancy forces are dominant and balance each other. This is characteristic of slow, creeping flows where inertial effects are negligible (low Reynolds number) and the flow is steady or quasi-steady.\nThe balance is:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{U}{L^2} \\sim \\rho_{0} g \\beta \\Delta T\n$$\nSolving for the velocity scale $U$, which we denote $U_{vb}$:\n$$\nU_{vb} = \\frac{\\rho_{0} g \\beta \\Delta T L^2}{\\mu}\n$$\nUsing the kinematic viscosity $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho_{0}$, we get:\n$$\nU_{vb} = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^2}{\\nu}\n$$\nThis balance is asymptotically consistent if the neglected inertial term is much smaller than the viscous term:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} \\frac{U_{vb}^2}{L} \\ll \\mu \\frac{U_{vb}}{L^2} \\implies \\frac{\\rho_{0} U_{vb} L}{\\mu} \\ll 1\n$$\nThis condition is $\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 1$, where the Reynolds number is $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$. To find the controlling parameter, we substitute $U_{vb}$ into the Reynolds number:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{U_{vb} L}{\\nu} = \\left(\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^2}{\\nu}\\right) \\frac{L}{\\nu} = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu^2} = \\mathrm{Gr}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Gr}$ is the Grashof number. Thus, the viscous-buoyancy balance is valid when $\\mathrm{Gr} \\ll 1$.\n\n**2. Inertial–Buoyancy Balance**\nThis regime assumes that inertial and buoyancy forces are dominant. This is characteristic of fast-moving, high Reynolds number flows where viscous effects are confined to thin boundary layers.\nThe balance is:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} \\frac{U^2}{L} \\sim \\rho_{0} g \\beta \\Delta T\n$$\nSolving for the velocity scale $U$, denoted $U_{ib}$:\n$$\nU_{ib}^2 = g \\beta \\Delta T L \\implies U_{ib} = \\sqrt{g \\beta \\Delta T L}\n$$\nThis balance is asymptotically consistent if the neglected viscous term is much smaller than the inertial term:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{U_{ib}}{L^2} \\ll \\rho_{0} \\frac{U_{ib}^2}{L} \\implies 1 \\ll \\frac{\\rho_{0} U_{ib} L}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis condition is $\\mathrm{Re} \\gg 1$. Substituting $U_{ib}$ into the Reynolds number:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{U_{ib} L}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\sqrt{g \\beta \\Delta T L} L}{\\nu} = \\sqrt{\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu^2}} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Gr}}\n$$\nThus, the condition $\\mathrm{Re} \\gg 1$ is equivalent to $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\gg 1$, or $\\mathrm{Gr} \\gg 1$. The inertial-buoyancy balance is valid for large Grashof numbers.\nThis balance can also be interpreted using a buoyancy-based Froude number, defined as the ratio of inertial to buoyancy forces: $Fr_b^2 = \\frac{\\text{Inertia}}{\\text{Buoyancy}} = \\frac{\\rho_0 U^2/L}{\\rho_0 g \\beta \\Delta T} = \\frac{U^2}{g \\beta \\Delta T L}$. The inertial-buoyancy balance corresponds to the regime where $Fr_b \\sim 1$.\n\n**3. Unsteady–Buoyancy (Startup) Balance**\nThis regime describes the initial acceleration of the fluid from rest, driven by the buoyancy force. It is valid for short times after the onset of heating, before significant velocity has developed and viscous effects have had time to propagate. The characteristic timescale is the reaction time, $t_{char} = \\tau$.\nThe balance is:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} \\frac{U}{\\tau} \\sim \\rho_{0} g \\beta \\Delta T\n$$\nSolving for the velocity scale $U$, denoted $U_{ub}$:\n$$\nU_{ub} = g \\beta \\Delta T \\tau\n$$\nThis balance is asymptotically consistent if the neglected inertial and viscous terms are much smaller than the unsteady term during this initial phase.\na) Inertial term is small: $\\rho_{0} \\frac{U_{ub}^2}{L} \\ll \\rho_{0} \\frac{U_{ub}}{\\tau} \\implies \\frac{U_{ub} \\tau}{L} \\ll 1$. Substituting $U_{ub}$ gives the condition $\\frac{(g \\beta \\Delta T \\tau) \\tau}{L} \\ll 1$, or $\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\tau^2}{L} \\ll 1$.\nb) Viscous term is small: $\\mu \\frac{U_{ub}}{L^2} \\ll \\rho_{0} \\frac{U_{ub}}{\\tau} \\implies \\frac{\\mu \\tau}{\\rho_{0} L^2} \\ll 1$. Using $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho_{0}$, this becomes $\\frac{\\nu \\tau}{L^2} \\ll 1$, which means the reaction time $\\tau$ must be much shorter than the viscous diffusion time, $\\tau_{visc} = L^2/\\nu$.\nBoth conditions must hold for the unsteady-buoyancy balance to be valid.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^2}{\\nu}  \\sqrt{g \\beta \\Delta T L}  g \\beta \\Delta T \\tau \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3503042"}, {"introduction": "Many critical phenomena in multiphysics occur in thin regions, like boundary layers, where properties change dramatically.

You are asked to construct a nondimensionalization that consistently captures the dominant balances within the thin boundary layer while retaining the correct streamwise development along the macroscopic length.\n\nWhich of the following scaling hierarchies is asymptotically consistent (in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$) with the governing laws and boundary layer physics described, producing leading-order balances that couple streamwise advection, wall-normal diffusion, and incompressibility, and that also correctly orders the neglected terms?\n\nA. Scale both coordinates with the macroscopic length: $x = L \\, x^*$, $y = L \\, y^*$. Scale velocities with the free stream: $u = U \\, u^*$, $v = U \\, v^*$. Scale time with the macroscopic advective time: $t = (L/U) \\, t^*$. Scale pressure with the dynamic pressure: $p = \\rho U^2 \\, p^*$. Scale temperature with the imposed difference: $T = T_\\infty + \\Delta T \\, \\theta$. This yields Reynolds and Péclet numbers $\\mathrm{Re}_L = \\rho U L / \\mu$ and $\\mathrm{Pe}_L = \\rho c_p U L / k$, and retains both $\\partial^2/\\partial x^2$ and $\\partial^2/\\partial y^2$ viscous and diffusive terms at the same order.\n\nB. Scale streamwise and wall-normal coordinates differently: $x = L \\, x^*$, $y = \\delta \\, y^*$. Scale velocities with $u = U \\, u^*$ and $v = (\\delta/L) U \\, v^*$. Scale time with the macroscopic advective time: $t = (L/U) \\, t^*$. Scale pressure with dynamic pressure: $p = \\rho U^2 \\, p^*$. Scale temperature with $T = T_\\infty + \\Delta T \\, \\theta$. This produces a distinguished limit in the axial momentum: the streamwise advection and wall-normal viscous diffusion balance at leading order via a boundary-layer Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}_\\delta = \\rho U \\delta / \\mu$, with $\\partial^2/\\partial x^2$ negligible by a factor $\\epsilon^2$, and likewise a thermal boundary-layer Péclet number $\\mathrm{Pe}_\\delta = \\rho c_p U \\delta / k$ with wall-normal diffusion competing against streamwise advection.\n\nC. Scale $x = L \\, x^*$, $y = \\delta \\, y^*$, but scale velocities with $u = U \\, u^*$ and $v = U \\, v^*$, and scale time with the thin-layer advective time $t = (\\delta/U) \\, t^*$. Scale pressure with $p = \\mu U / \\delta \\, p^*$. Scale temperature with $T = T_\\infty + \\Delta T \\, \\theta$. This enforces that both components of velocity are the same order, maintains time derivatives at the same order as streamwise advection, and sets viscous stresses to balance the pressure gradient.\n\nD. Scale $x = L \\, x^*$, $y = \\delta \\, y^*$, $u = U \\, u^*$, $v = (\\delta/L) U \\, v^*$, $t = (L/U) \\, t^*$, but scale pressure and temperature conduction with viscosity and conductivity: $p = (\\mu U / \\delta) \\, p^*$ and introduce a thermal conductivity-based time scale $t = (\\rho c_p \\delta^2 / k) \\, t^*$. This aims to make viscous and conductive terms order unity by construction while keeping the advection terms subleading.\n\nChoose the option that yields a self-consistent boundary-layer nondimensionalization for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$ that respects conservation of mass, correctly orders axial versus wall-normal gradients, and produces a leading-order multiphysics coupling between streamwise advection and wall-normal diffusion in both momentum and energy equations without artificially suppressing inertia or advection.

The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe goal is to nondimensionalize the governing equations for a thin boundary layer where the characteristic length scale in the wall-normal direction, $\\delta$, is much smaller than in the streamwise direction, $L$. This suggests an anisotropic coordinate scaling.\n\nLet's introduce dimensionless variables, denoted by an asterisk ($*$), which are of order one, $O(1)$, inside the boundary layer.\n1.  **Coordinates:** The gradients are much steeper in the $y$-direction. Thus, we scale the coordinates anisotropically:\n    $$x = L x^*, \\quad y = \\delta y^*$$\n    where $\\epsilon = \\delta / L \\ll 1$. The partial derivatives become:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^*}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^*}$$\n\n2.  **Velocities:** The streamwise velocity $u$ is of the order of the free-stream velocity $U$. The scale for the wall-normal velocity $v$ is determined by the continuity equation to ensure mass conservation.\n    $$u = U u^*$$\n    Substituting into the continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$:\n    $$\\frac{U}{L} \\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial x^*} + \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y^*} = 0$$\n    For both terms to be of the same order of magnitude, the characteristic velocity scale for $v$, let's call it $V$, must satisfy $\\frac{U}{L} \\sim \\frac{V}{\\delta}$. This yields $V \\sim U \\frac{\\delta}{L} = \\epsilon U$. So, the correct scaling for $v$ is:\n    $$v = \\frac{\\delta}{L} U v^* = \\epsilon U v^*$$\n\n3.  **Pressure:** We leave the pressure scale $p_c$ to be determined from the momentum balance. Let $p = p_c p^*$.\n\n4.  **Temperature:** We scale the temperature based on the free-stream temperature $T_\\infty$ and a characteristic temperature difference $\\Delta T$.\n    $$T = T_\\infty + \\Delta T \\theta$$\n\nNow, we substitute these scalings into the governing equations.\n\n**x-Momentum Equation:**\n$\\rho \\left( (U u^*) \\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial x^*} + (\\epsilon U v^*) \\frac{U}{\\delta}\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial y^*} \\right) = - \\frac{p_c}{L}\\frac{\\partial p^*}{\\partial x^*} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{U}{L^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial x^{*2}} + \\frac{U}{\\delta^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial y^{*2}} \\right)$\nUsing $\\delta = \\epsilon L$ and simplifying:\n$\\frac{\\rho U^2}{L} \\left( u^*\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial x^*} + v^*\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial y^*} \\right) = - \\frac{p_c}{L}\\frac{\\partial p^*}{\\partial x^*} + \\frac{\\mu U}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial x^{*2}} + \\frac{\\mu U}{\\epsilon^2 L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial y^{*2}}$\n\nTo make the equation dimensionless, we divide by the coefficient of the inertial terms, $\\frac{\\rho U^2}{L}$:\n$u^*\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial x^*} + v^*\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial y^*} = - \\frac{p_c}{\\rho U^2} \\frac{\\partial p^*}{\\partial x^*} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho U L} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial x^{*2}} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho U L \\epsilon^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial y^{*2}}$\nThe standard choice for pressure scaling in flows where inertia is important is the dynamic pressure, $p_c = \\rho U^2$. This makes the pressure gradient term $O(1)$. Introducing the Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}_L = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}$:\n$$u^*\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial x^*} + v^*\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial y^*} = - \\frac{\\partial p^*}{\\partial x^*} + \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re}_L} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial x^{*2}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 \\mathrm{Re}_L} \\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial y^{*2}}$$\nThe defining characteristic of the boundary layer is the balance between inertial forces (LHS, $O(1)$) and viscous forces. For a thin layer, wall-normal diffusion must be dominant over streamwise diffusion. The term $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$ is much larger than $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$. Our scaled equation reflects this: the coefficient of the wall-normal diffusion term is amplified by $1/\\epsilon^2$. To achieve a dominant balance between inertia and wall-normal viscosity, we require the coefficient of the wall-normal diffusion term to be $O(1)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 \\mathrm{Re}_L} \\sim O(1)$$\nThis defines the \"distinguished limit\" for the boundary layer and implies that $\\mathrm{Re}_L \\sim 1/\\epsilon^2$. Under this condition, the coefficient of the streamwise diffusion term is $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re}_L} \\sim \\epsilon^2$, which means this term is negligible as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. This confirms that streamwise advection balances wall-normal diffusion.\n\n**Energy Equation:**\n$\\rho c_p \\left( (U u^*) \\frac{\\Delta T}{L}\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x^*} + (\\epsilon U v^*) \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta}\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*} \\right) = k \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T}{L^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^{*2}} + \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial y^{*2}} \\right)$\nSimplifying and dividing by the advection coefficient $\\frac{\\rho c_p U \\Delta T}{L}$:\n$u^*\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x^*} + v^*\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p U L} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^{*2}} + \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p U L \\epsilon^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial y^{*2}}$\nIntroducing the Péclet number $\\mathrm{Pe}_L = \\frac{\\rho c_p U L}{k} = \\mathrm{Re}_L \\mathrm{Pr}$ (where $\\mathrm{Pr}$ is the Prandtl number):\n$$u^*\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x^*} + v^*\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y^*} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pe}_L} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^{*2}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 \\mathrm{Pe}_L} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial y^{*2}}$$\nAnalogous to the momentum equation, for a balance between advection and wall-normal diffusion, we require $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 \\mathrm{Pe}_L} \\sim O(1)$. If $\\mathrm{Pr} \\sim O(1)$, then since $\\mathrm{Re}_L \\sim 1/\\epsilon^2$, we have $\\mathrm{Pe}_L \\sim 1/\\epsilon^2$, and the condition is satisfied. The streamwise diffusion term, with coefficient $1/\\mathrm{Pe}_L \\sim \\epsilon^2$, is again negligible.\n\nThis completes the derivation of the correct boundary layer scaling.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Scale both coordinates with the macroscopic length: $x = L \\, x^*$, $y = L \\, y^*$. [...]**\nThis employs an isotropic scaling ($y=Ly^*$) which is fundamentally incorrect for a thin boundary layer. It assumes that variations in $x$ and $y$ occur on the same length scale, which contradicts the premise $\\delta \\ll L$. This scaling is appropriate for the outer, inviscid flow region, not the boundary layer where viscous or diffusive effects near the wall are crucial. It fails to produce the desired balance, as for large $\\mathrm{Re}_L$, all diffusive terms become negligible, leading to the Euler equations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Scale streamwise and wall-normal coordinates differently: $x = L \\, x^*$, $y = \\delta \\, y^*$. Scale velocities with $u = U \\, u^*$ and $v = (\\delta/L) U \\, v^*$. [...]**\nThis option proposes the correct anisotropic coordinate scaling ($x = L x^*, y = \\delta y^*$). It correctly derives the scaling for the wall-normal velocity $v = (\\delta/L) U v^*$ from the continuity equation. It uses the correct dynamic pressure scaling $p = \\rho U^2 p^*$ for an inertia-important flow. The consequence described—that streamwise advection balances wall-normal diffusion at leading order, while streamwise diffusion is negligible by a factor of $\\epsilon^2$—is precisely what our derivation showed. The reasoning extends perfectly to the energy equation. All aspects of this option are consistent with the established theory of boundary layers. The mention of the macroscopic advective time $t=(L/U)t^*$ is the correct choice for describing the evolution of the flow structure along the length $L$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Scale $x = L \\, x^*$, $y = \\delta \\, y^*$, but scale velocities with $u = U \\, u^*$ and $v = U \\, v^*$, [...]**\nThis option uses the correct coordinate scaling but an incorrect velocity scaling for $v$. Setting $v = U v^*$ while $y = \\delta y^*$ violates the continuity equation in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$. The scaled continuity equation would be $\\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial x^*} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\frac{\\partial v^*}{\\partial y^*} = 0$, which cannot be satisfied by $O(1)$ variables. Furthermore, the pressure scaling $p = \\mu U / \\delta \\, p^*$ is characteristic of low Reynolds number, viscous-dominated flows (lubrication approximation), which contradicts the objective of balancing inertia (advection) with diffusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Scale $x = L \\, x^*$, $y = \\delta \\, y^*$, $u = U \\, u^*$, $v = (\\delta/L) U \\, v^*$, [...] but scale pressure [...] with viscosity [...]: $p = (\\mu U / \\delta) \\, p^*$ [...]**\nThis option starts with the correct scalings for coordinates and velocities. However, like option C, it introduces a viscous pressure scale, $p = (\\mu U / \\delta) \\, p^*$. As noted, this scaling is appropriate for flows where viscous forces dominate inertial forces, causing the inertial terms on the left-hand side of the momentum equation to be negligible. The problem statement explicitly asks for a scaling that *couples* streamwise advection (inertia) with diffusion, not one that suppresses advection. The option's own description confirms this flaw: \"aims to make viscous and conductive terms order unity by construction while keeping the advection terms subleading.\" The option is also internally contradictory by proposing two distinct time scales.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3503095"}]}
