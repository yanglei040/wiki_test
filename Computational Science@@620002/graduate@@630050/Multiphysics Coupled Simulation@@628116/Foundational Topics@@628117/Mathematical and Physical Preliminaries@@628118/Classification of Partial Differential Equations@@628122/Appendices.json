The classification criteria are as follows:\n- The PDE is **elliptic** at $(x,y)$ if $B^2 - AC  0$. Elliptic equations are typically associated with steady-state phenomena and diffusive smoothing, such as the Laplace equation.\n- The PDE is **parabolic** at $(x,y)$ if $B^2 - AC = 0$. Parabolic equations are characteristic of time-dependent diffusive processes, such as the heat equation.\n- The PDE is **hyperbolic** at $(x,y)$ if $B^2 - AC  0$. Hyperbolic equations model wave-like propagation, such as the wave equation.\n\nThe specific PDE provided in the problem is:\n$$u_{xx} + x\\,u_{yy} = 0$$\nThis equation involves a variable coefficient, $x$, which means its type is not uniform across the entire $(x,y)$-plane.
