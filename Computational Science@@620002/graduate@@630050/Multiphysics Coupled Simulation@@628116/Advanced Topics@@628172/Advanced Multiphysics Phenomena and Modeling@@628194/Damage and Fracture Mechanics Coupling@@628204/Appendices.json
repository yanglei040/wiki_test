The bar is quasi-statically loaded in uniaxial tension by prescribing the end displacement $u(L)=\\bar{u}$ and fixing $u(0)=0$, with small strains $\\varepsilon(x)=u'(x)$. Let $d(x)\\in[0,1]$ be a scalar damage (phase-field) variable, where $d=0$ denotes the intact state and $d=1$ the fully damaged state.

The formulation is based on established principles of continuum mechanics, including free energy functionals and the principle of virtual power. All terms and concepts like Young's modulus, energy release rate, and stiffness degradation are standard. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The assumptions are clearly stated and physically reasonable within the context of the model. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Task 1: Energy Balance\n\nThe quasi-static evolution of the system is governed by a total potential energy functional, $\\Pi$, which comprises the stored elastic energy and the energy associated with the formation of crack surfaces. For the entire bar, this functional is:\n$$\n\\Pi[u, d] = \\int_0^L A \\left( \\psi(\\varepsilon, d) + G_c \\gamma(d, d') \\right) dx\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the cross-sectional area. Substituting the given forms for $\\psi$ and $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\Pi[u, d] = \\int_0^L A \\left[ \\left( (1-d)^2 + \\kappa \\right) \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon^2 + G_c \\left( \\frac{d}{\\ell} + \\frac{\\ell}{2} (d')^2 \\right) \\right] dx\n$$\nThe problem is isothermal and inertialess. The first law of thermodynamics, or the energy balance, states that the work done by external forces, $W_{ext}$, equals the change in the system's stored energy plus the energy dissipated, $W_{diss}$. Over a time interval $[t_1, t_2]$, this is written as:\n$$\nW_{ext} = \\Delta E_{stored} + W_{diss}\n$$\nIn the context of this phase-field model, the change in the total potential energy functional, $\\Delta\\Pi = \\Pi(t_2)-\\Pi(t_1)$, accounts for changes in both recoverable elastic energy and the irrecoverable energy of fracture. The variational framework for rate-independent fracture is constructed such that the work done by external forces is exactly balanced by the change in this total potential energy, encompassing all energetic costs.\n$$\nW_{ext} = \\Delta \\Pi = \\Delta \\Psi_{el} + \\Delta \\Psi_{crack}\n$$\nwhere $\\Psi_{el}$ is the total elastic energy stored in the body and $\\Psi_{crack}$ is the total regularized crack surface energy.\n\nThe problem asks to separate the energy balance into three contributions. We can express the total balance by identifying a third term, the \"irreversible damage dissipation\", $W_{dissipation}$, and then showing its value within this specific theoretical framework. The global energy balance over a time interval $[t_1, t_2]$ is:\n$$\n\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} P_{ext}(t) dt = \\Delta \\Psi_{el} + \\Delta \\Psi_{crack} + W_{dissipation}\n$$\nwhere $P_{ext}$ is the power of the external forces, $P_{ext} = A \\sigma(L,t) \\dot{\\bar{u}}(t)$.\n\nLet's identify each of the three contributions:\n\n(i) **Stored Elastic Energy:** This is the recoverable energy stored in the material due to elastic deformation. The change in stored elastic energy over the interval $[t_1, t_2]$ is $\\Delta \\Psi_{el} = \\Psi_{el}(t_2) - \\Psi_{el}(t_1)$, where the total stored elastic energy at a given time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\Psi_{el}(t) = \\int_0^L A g(d(x,t)) \\psi_0(\\varepsilon(x,t)) dx = \\int_0^L A \\left( (1-d(x,t))^2 + \\kappa \\right) \\frac{1}{2} E (\\varepsilon(x,t))^2 dx\n$$\n\n(ii) **Crack Surface Energy:** This is the energy required to create the new (regularized) crack surfaces, as defined by the phase-field model. The change in this energy over the interval is $\\Delta \\Psi_{crack} = \\Psi_{crack}(t_2) - \\Psi_{crack}(t_1)$, where the total crack surface energy at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\Psi_{crack}(t) = \\int_0^L A G_c \\gamma(d(x,t), d'(x,t)) dx = \\int_0^L A G_c \\left( \\frac{d(x,t)}{\\ell} + \\frac{\\ell}{2} (d'(x,t))^2 \\right) dx\n$$\nThis term is, by its physical nature, a form of dissipated energy, as it is irrecoverable.\n\n(iii) **Irreversible Damage Dissipation:** This term represents any dissipation not already accounted for by the crack surface energy functional. In a general thermomechanical framework, this is the product of the thermodynamic force driving damage and the rate of damage evolution. The rate of this dissipation is $\\mathcal{D} = \\int_0^L A \\mathcal{F}_d \\dot{d} dx$. The thermodynamic driving force for damage, $\\mathcal{F}_d$, is derived from the total potential $\\Pi$. The evolution of damage is governed by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for rate-independent, irreversible processes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_d \\le 0, \\quad \\dot{d} \\ge 0, \\quad \\mathcal{F}_d \\dot{d} = 0\n$$\nThe driving force is the negative of the variational derivative of $\\Pi$ with respect to $d$: $\\mathcal{F}_d = -\\frac{1}{A} \\frac{\\delta \\Pi}{\\delta d}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta \\Pi}{\\delta d} = A \\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial d} + G_c \\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial d} - G_c \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial d'}\\right) \\right] = A \\left[ g'(d)\\psi_0 + G_c \\left( \\frac{1}{\\ell} - \\ell d'' \\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing $g'(d) = -2(1-d)$ and defining the elastic energy release rate $Y = -g'(d)\\psi_0 = 2(1-d)\\psi_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta \\Pi}{\\delta d} = A \\left[ -Y + G_c \\left( \\frac{1}{\\ell} - \\ell d'' \\right) \\right]\n$$\nSo, the driving force is $\\mathcal{F}_d = Y - G_c \\left( \\frac{1}{\\ell} - \\ell d'' \\right)$. The KKT condition $\\mathcal{F}_d \\dot{d} = 0$ implies that the rate of this specific form of dissipation is zero at all times and at all points in the bar: $\\mathcal{D}(t) = 0$. Consequently, the total dissipation from this source over any time interval is also zero.\n$$\nW_{dissipation} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathcal{D}(t) dt = 0\n$$\nThis is a fundamental feature of variational models of fracture, where all dissipation is encapsulated within the fracture energy term. The energy balance thus simplifies to $W_{ext} = \\Delta \\Psi_{el} + \\Delta \\Psi_{crack}$.\n\n### Task 2: Onset of Damage under Homogeneous Tension\n\nFor this task, we specialize to a state of homogeneous uniaxial tension.\n- The strain is uniform: $\\varepsilon(x) = \\varepsilon_0$. The displacement field is $u(x) = \\varepsilon_0 x$. Given $u(L) = \\bar{u}$, we have $\\varepsilon_0 = \\bar{u}/L$.\n- At the onset of damage, the material is still in its intact state, so $d(x) = 0$.\n- We consider the onset of homogeneous damage, meaning any infinitesimal damage $d$ that appears is also spatially uniform, so $d(x) = d_0 \\approx 0$ and $d'(x) = 0, d''(x) = 0$.\n\nDamage will initiate when the intact state $d=0$ becomes unstable. This occurs when the total potential energy $\\Pi$ can be decreased by an infinitesimal increase in damage. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the homogeneous damage variable $d_0$ becomes negative. The threshold for damage initiation is when this derivative first reaches zero.\n\nFor a homogeneous state $(u(x)=\\varepsilon_0 x, d(x)=d_0)$, the total potential energy functional simplifies to an algebraic function of $\\varepsilon_0$ and $d_0$:\n$$\n\\Pi(\\varepsilon_0, d_0) = \\int_0^L A \\left[ ((1-d_0)^2+\\kappa) \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon_0^2 + G_c \\frac{d_0}{\\ell} \\right] dx\n$$\n$$\n\\Pi(\\varepsilon_0, d_0) = A L \\left[ ((1-d_0)^2+\\kappa) \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon_0^2 + G_c \\frac{d_0}{\\ell} \\right]\n$$\nTo find the condition for damage initiation, we compute the partial derivative of $\\Pi$ with respect to $d_0$ and evaluate it at the intact state $d_0=0$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial d_0} = A L \\left[ 2(1-d_0)(-1) \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon_0^2 + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell} \\right] = A L \\left[ -(1-d_0) E \\varepsilon_0^2 + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell} \\right]\n$$\nThe KKT condition for damage evolution, as derived from the global potential, is $\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial d_0} \\le 0$ (since $\\dot{d}_0 \\ge 0$). Damage onset occurs at the threshold strain $\\varepsilon_c$ where this inequality is first met, i.e., at equality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial d_0} \\bigg|_{d_0=0, \\varepsilon_0=\\varepsilon_c} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $d_0=0$ and $\\varepsilon_0=\\varepsilon_c$ into the derivative:\n$$\nA L \\left[ -(1-0) E \\varepsilon_c^2 + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell} \\right] = 0\n$$\n$$\n-E \\varepsilon_c^2 + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell} = 0\n$$\nThis gives the critical strain for the onset of homogeneous damage:\n$$\nE \\varepsilon_c^2 = \\frac{G_c}{\\ell} \\implies \\varepsilon_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{E \\ell}}\n$$\n(We take the positive root as the bar is in tension).\nThe critical end displacement $\\bar{u}_c$ corresponding to this critical strain is found from the kinematic relation $\\varepsilon_c = \\bar{u}_c/L$.\n$$\n\\bar{u}_c = L \\varepsilon_c = L \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{E \\ell}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the critical displacement for damage onset in terms of the given parameters. The residual stiffness $\\kappa$ does not affect the onset of damage, only the post-damage behavior.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{L \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{E \\ell}}}\n$$", "id": "3501236"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the general theory to the specifics of material behavior, we now address a critical feature of many engineering materials: their asymmetric response to tension and compression.

This exercise [@problem_id:3501282] bridges the gap between material-level laws and macroscopic structural failure. By combining classic linear elastic beam theory with a Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) for fracture, you will develop an algorithm to predict the load-displacement response and crack growth in a Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimen, a standard test for measuring fracture toughness.", "problem": "A symmetric Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimen composed of two identical, linearly elastic arms is opened under quasi-static, displacement-controlled loading. The interface between the arms is governed by a bilinear Cohesive Zone Model (CZM). The goal is to compute the load–displacement response via first principles and estimate the fracture energy per unit area $G_c$ from the area under the traction–separation curve. Then, use an energy release rate criterion to couple the cohesive-fracture with structural compliance and simulate crack growth. The analysis must adhere to the following physical and mathematical assumptions: small strains, small deflections, linear elasticity in the beam arms, Euler–Bernoulli kinematics, and quasi-static loading. Acronyms must be defined on first use: Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and Cohesive Zone Model (CZM).\n\nStart from the following fundamental bases:\n- The definition of curvature and linear beam theory for Euler–Bernoulli beams (plane sections remain plane), including the relationship between bending moment and curvature $M = E I \\kappa$ and the end deflection of a cantilever beam under an end force.\n- The definition of fracture energy release rate $G$ as the energy released per newly created crack surface area, and the compliance method to express $G$ in terms of applied load $P$ and the derivative of compliance $C(a)$ with respect to crack length $a$.\n\nProblem tasks:\n1. Derive the DCB compliance $C(a)$ for two identical arms of thickness $h$ and width $b$ made of a material of Young’s modulus $E$, each behaving as an Euler–Bernoulli cantilever of length equal to the current crack length $a$. Express the opening displacement $\\delta$ as a function of the applied load $P$ and define $C(a)$ by the relation $\\delta = C(a) P$.\n2. For a bilinear traction–separation law with an initial linear elastic branch of stiffness $K$ up to a peak traction $\\sigma_{\\max}$ at separation $\\Delta_0$, followed by a linear softening branch down to zero traction at separation $\\Delta_f$, compute the fracture energy per unit area $G_c$ as the area under the traction–separation curve, i.e., $G_c = \\int_0^{\\Delta_f} t(\\Delta)\\,d\\Delta$. Do not assume any shortcut formulas; explicitly reason about the geometry of the piecewise-linear curve.\n3. Using the compliance method for energy release rate, and letting $B$ denote the specimen width $b$, express the energy release rate $G$ in terms of $P$, $B$, and $\\frac{dC}{da}$, and explain how crack advance is determined by the condition $G \\ge G_c$ under displacement control. The simulation must update the crack length $a$ in small increments $\\Delta a$ whenever $G \\ge G_c$, with the constraint $a \\le L$, where $L$ is the arm length.\n4. Implement a quasi-static displacement ramp from $\\delta = 0$ to a specified maximum $\\delta_{\\max}$ in increments $\\Delta \\delta$, computing at each increment the equilibrium load $P$ from the current compliance and crack length, checking the energy release rate $G$, and incrementing $a$ by $\\Delta a$ until $G < G_c$ or $a = L$. Assume monotonic loading and use a stable update rule.\n\nPhysical units must be strictly in the International System (SI) of units.

The solution will be developed by first establishing the fundamental relationships from linear elastic beam theory and fracture mechanics, and then integrating them into a numerical simulation algorithm as specified. All physical quantities are expressed in SI units.\n\nThe analysis is performed in four principal steps as requested:\n1. Derivation of the beam compliance as a function of crack length.\n2. Calculation of the critical fracture energy from the given cohesive law.\n3. Formulation of the energy release rate and the crack propagation criterion.\n4. Implementation of a quasi-static displacement-controlled simulation to compute the load-displacement response and track crack growth.\n\n**1. Derivation of DCB Compliance $C(a)$**\n\nThe DCB specimen is modeled as two identical cantilever beams, each of length $a$ corresponding to the current crack length. The arms have a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and thickness $h$, and are made of a linear elastic material with Young's modulus $E$. The analysis adheres to Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which is appropriate for slender beams under small deflections.\n\nA total opening load $P$ is applied, which splits equally between the two arms. Therefore, each arm is subjected to an end load of $P/2$. The total opening displacement $\\delta$ is the sum of the deflections of the upper and lower arms.\n\nThe deflection $\\delta_{\\text{arm}}$ at the end of a single cantilever beam of length $a$ under a transverse point load $P_{\\text{arm}}$ is given by the standard formula:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\text{arm}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{arm}} a^3}{3EI}\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section. For a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and thickness $h$, $I$ is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{bh^3}{12}\n$$\nWith $P_{\\text{arm}} = P/2$, the deflection of a single arm is:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\text{arm}} = \\frac{(P/2) a^3}{3E \\left(\\frac{bh^3}{12}\\right)} = \\frac{6Pa^3}{3Ebh^3} = \\frac{2Pa^3}{Ebh^3}\n$$\nThe total opening displacement $\\delta$ is the sum of the deflections of the top and bottom arms, which are identical:\n$$\n\\delta = \\delta_{\\text{arm, top}} + \\delta_{\\text{arm, bottom}} = 2\\delta_{\\text{arm}} = \\frac{4Pa^3}{Ebh^3}\n$$\nThe compliance of the DCB specimen, $C(a)$, is defined by the relationship $\\delta = C(a)P$. From the expression for $\\delta$, we can directly identify the compliance:\n$$\nC(a) = \\frac{4a^3}{Ebh^3}\n$$\n\n**2. Computation of Fracture Energy $G_c$**\n\nThe interface between the two arms is described by a bilinear Cohesive Zone Model (CZM). This model defines the traction $t$ across the interface as a function of the separation $\\Delta$. The traction-separation law is piecewise linear:\n- An initial linear elastic branch for $0 \\le \\Delta \\le \\Delta_0$:\n  $$\n  t(\\Delta) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{\\Delta_0}\\Delta\n  $$\n- A linear softening branch for $\\Delta_0 < \\Delta \\le \\Delta_f$:\n  $$\n  t(\\Delta) = \\sigma_{\\max}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_f - \\Delta}{\\Delta_f - \\Delta_0}\\right)\n  $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\max}$ is the peak traction reached at a critical separation $\\Delta_0$, and $\\Delta_f$ is the final separation at which the traction vanishes and the surfaces are completely debonded.\n\nThe fracture energy per unit area, $G_c$, is defined as the total work done to create a unit area of new fracture surface. This is equivalent to the area under the traction-separation curve:\n$$\nG_c = \\int_0^{\\Delta_f} t(\\Delta) \\, d\\Delta\n$$\nGeometrically, this area is that of a triangle with base $\\Delta_f$ and height $\\sigma_{\\max}$.\n$$\nG_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\max}\\Delta_f\n$$\nThis result represents the critical energy release rate for the material interface.\n\n**3. Energy Release Rate and Crack Growth Criterion**\n\nThe energy release rate, $G$, is the energy dissipated per unit increase in fracture area. Using the compliance method for a body of width $B=b$, $G$ is given by:\n$$\nG = \\frac{P^2}{2b} \\frac{dC}{da}\n$$\nWe must first compute the derivative of the compliance $C(a)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{da} = \\frac{d}{da}\\left(\\frac{4a^3}{Ebh^3}\\right) = \\frac{12a^2}{Ebh^3}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $G$:\n$$\nG = \\frac{P^2}{2b} \\left(\\frac{12a^2}{Ebh^3}\\right) = \\frac{6P^2a^2}{Eb^2h^3}\n$$\nCrack propagation occurs when the energy release rate $G$ reaches the critical fracture energy $G_c$. The criterion for crack advance is therefore:\n$$\nG \\ge G_c\n$$\nFor a displacement-controlled test, it is useful to express $G$ in terms of the applied displacement $\\delta$. Using $P = \\delta/C(a)$:\n$$\nG = \\frac{6a^2}{Eb^2h^3} \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{C(a)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{6a^2\\delta^2}{Eb^2h^3 C(a)^2} = \\frac{6a^2\\delta^2}{Eb^2h^3} \\left(\\frac{Ebh^3}{4a^3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{6a^2\\delta^2}{Eb^2h^3} \\frac{E^2b^2h^6}{16a^6} = \\frac{6E h^3 \\delta^2}{16a^4}\n$$\n$$\nG = \\frac{3E h^3 \\delta^2}{8a^4}\n$$\nThis expression shows that for a fixed displacement $\\delta$, $G$ decreases rapidly as the crack length $a$ increases (as $a^{-4}$). This indicates that crack propagation in a displacement-controlled DCB test is stable.\n\n**4. Algorithmic Implementation for Quasi-Static Simulation**\n\nA numerical simulation is implemented to trace the load-displacement response and crack growth. The loading is applied as a sequence of small displacement increments $\\Delta\\delta$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize parameters for the specific test case: $E, b, h, a_0, L, G_c, \\delta_{\\max}, \\Delta\\delta, \\Delta a$.\n2. Initialize state variables: current crack length $a \\leftarrow a_0$, peak load $P_{\\text{peak}} \\leftarrow 0$.\n3. Begin the main loop, incrementing the applied displacement $\\delta$ from $\\Delta\\delta$ to $\\delta_{\\max}$.\n4. Within each displacement step (for a fixed $\\delta$), enter an inner loop to check for crack propagation and find the stable equilibrium state.\n   a. Calculate the current compliance $C(a)$ and the corresponding trial load $P = \\delta/C(a)$.\n   b. Calculate the energy release rate $G$ using the current values of $P$ and $a$.\n   c. Check the propagation condition: If $G \\ge G_c$ and the crack has not reached the end of the specimen ($a < L$), advance the crack by one increment: $a \\leftarrow \\min(a + \\Delta a, L)$.\n   d. Repeat the inner loop (recalculating $C, P, G$) until the condition $G < G_c$ is met or $a=L$. This signifies that the crack has arrested at a new stable length for the current displacement $\\delta$.\n5. Once the inner loop terminates, the final equilibrium load $P$ for the current displacement step $\\delta$ is known. Update the peak load encountered so far: $P_{\\text{peak}} \\leftarrow \\max(P_{\\text{peak}}, P)$.\n6. Continue the outer loop to the next displacement increment.\n7. After the simulation completes (i.e., $\\delta$ reaches $\\delta_{\\max}$), the final values of $G_c$, $P_{\\text{peak}}$, and $a_{\\text{final}}$ are reported.\nThis procedure correctly models the quasi-static evolution of the system, where at each infinitesimally slow loading step, the crack propagates until it finds a new configuration where the energy release rate is balanced by the material's fracture toughness.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the DCB fracture mechanics problem for three test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test cases defined as (E, b, h, a0, L, sigma_max, Delta_0, Delta_f, delta_max, delta_delta, delta_a)\n    # All units are SI units.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (general case, moderate toughness)\n        (70e9, 0.02, 0.003, 0.05, 0.2, 12e6, 2e-5, 5e-4, 0.006, 2e-5, 5e-4),\n        # Case 2 (lower toughness and thinner arms; tests stable propagation behavior)\n        (30e9, 0.015, 0.0025, 0.03, 0.18, 8e6, 1.5e-5, 1.5e-4, 0.004, 1e-5, 2.5e-4),\n        # Case 3 (stiff arms, higher peak traction; tests no propagation within the displacement range)\n        (200e9, 0.02, 0.004, 0.06, 0.25, 15e6, 1e-5, 3e-4, 0.002, 1e-5, 2e-4),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        E, b, h, a0, L, sigma_max, _, Delta_f, delta_max, delta_delta, delta_a = case\n        \n        # --- Task 2: Compute fracture energy Gc ---\n        # Gc is the area under the bilinear traction-separation curve, which is a triangle.\n        # Gc = 0.5 * sigma_max * Delta_f\n        Gc = 0.5 * sigma_max * Delta_f\n\n        # --- Task 4: Implement the quasi-static simulation ---\n        a = a0\n        p_peak = 0.0\n        \n        # Discretize the displacement ramp\n        num_steps = int(round(delta_max / delta_delta))\n        displacements = np.linspace(delta_delta, delta_max, num=num_steps)\n\n        for delta in displacements:\n            # Inner loop for crack propagation at a fixed displacement 'delta'\n            # The crack extends until G < Gc, reaching a stable length for this 'delta'\n            while True:\n                if a >= L:\n                    # No more crack growth possible if length limit is reached\n                    break\n\n                # --- Task 1: Derive DCB compliance C(a) ---\n                # C(a) = 4 * a^3 / (E * b * h^3)\n                compliance = (4.0 * a**3) / (E * b * h**3)\n                \n                # Calculate equilibrium load P for the current displacement and crack length\n                P = delta / compliance\n\n                # --- Task 3: Energy Release Rate G and Crack Growth Criterion ---\n                # G = (6 * P^2 * a^2) / (E * b^2 * h^3)\n                G = (6.0 * P**2 * a**2) / (E * b**2 * h**3)\n\n                # Check for crack propagation\n                if G >= Gc:\n                    a += delta_a\n                    # Clamp crack length to the specimen length\n                    a = min(a, L)\n                else:\n                    # Equilibrium is reached for this displacement step\n                    break\n\n            # After reaching equilibrium, calculate the final load for this step\n            final_compliance = (4.0 * a**3) / (E * b * h**3)\n            final_P = delta / final_compliance\n            \n            # Update the peak load\n            p_peak = max(p_peak, final_P)\n\n        a_final = a\n        \n        results.append([Gc, p_peak, a_final])\n\n    # Format the final output as a string representation of a list of lists.\n    # e.g., [[g1,p1,a1],[g2,p2,a2],[g3,p3,a3]]\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join([f\"[{r[0]},{r[1]},{r[2]}]\" for r in results]) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3501282"}]}
