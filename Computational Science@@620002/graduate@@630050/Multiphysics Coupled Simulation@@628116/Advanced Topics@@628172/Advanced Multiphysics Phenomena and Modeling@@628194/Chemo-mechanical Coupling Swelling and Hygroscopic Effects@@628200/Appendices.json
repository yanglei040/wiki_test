The problem is directly relevant to the topic of chemo-mechanical coupling in the context of multiphysics simulations. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity are found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe chemical potential, $\\mu$, of a species is given by the expression:\n$$ \\mu = \\mu^0 + RT \\ln(a) $$\nwhere $\\mu^0$ is the chemical potential of the species in its standard state, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $a$ is the activity of the species.\n\nFor this problem, the system involves water. The standard state for water is defined as pure liquid water at the same temperature. Therefore, the chemical potential of the standard state is the chemical potential of pure liquid water, $\\mu_{\\text{liquid}}^0$. By definition, the activity of a substance in its standard state is $1$.\nSo, for pure liquid water:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{liquid}}^0 = \\mu^0 + RT \\ln(1) = \\mu^0 $$\nThis confirms that $\\mu^0 = \\mu_{\\text{liquid}}^0$.\n\nNext, we consider the chemical potential of water in the ambient vapor, $\\mu_{\\text{vapor}}$. The activity of water vapor, $a_w$, is given by the ratio of its partial pressure, $p_w$, to its saturation vapor pressure, $p_w^{\\mathrm{sat}}$, at the given temperature:\n$$ a_w = \\frac{p_w}{p_w^{\\mathrm{sat}}} $$\nThe problem states that this ratio is defined as the relative humidity, $\\mathrm{RH}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{RH} = \\frac{p_w}{p_w^{\\mathrm{sat}}} $$\nTherefore, the activity of water in the ambient vapor is equal to the relative humidity, $a_w = \\mathrm{RH}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the general expression for chemical potential, we find the chemical potential of water in the ambient vapor:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{vapor}} = \\mu^0 + RT \\ln(a_w) = \\mu_{\\text{liquid}}^0 + RT \\ln(\\mathrm{RH}) $$\nThe problem asks for the change in chemical potential, $\\Delta\\mu$, between the ambient vapor and pure liquid water. This is the difference between their chemical potentials:\n$$ \\Delta\\mu = \\mu_{\\text{vapor}} - \\mu_{\\text{liquid}}^0 $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\Delta\\mu = ( \\mu_{\\text{liquid}}^0 + RT \\ln(\\mathrm{RH}) ) - \\mu_{\\text{liquid}}^0 $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the change in chemical potential:\n$$ \\Delta\\mu = RT \\ln(\\mathrm{RH}) $$\nThis expression represents the difference in chemical potential of water in humid air relative to pure liquid water. Since $\\mathrm{RH} \\le 1$, the term $\\ln(\\mathrm{RH})$ is always less than or equal to zero, which means $\\Delta\\mu \\le 0$. This indicates that water in an unsaturated vapor is at a lower chemical potential (more thermodynamically stable) than pure liquid water at the same temperature, which is why pure liquid water will spontaneously evaporate into unsaturated air.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values:\n$R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}$\n$T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$\\mathrm{RH} = 0.60$\n\n$$ \\Delta\\mu = (8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(0.60) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\mu \\approx (2477.71005\\ \\mathrm{J/mol}) \\times (-0.51082562) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\mu \\approx -1265.681\\ \\mathrm{J/mol} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta\\mu = -1266\\ \\mathrm{J/mol} $$\n\n**Qualitative Explanation of Chemo-Mechanical Coupling**\n\nThe calculated chemical potential difference, $\\Delta\\mu = -1266\\ \\mathrm{J/mol}$, represents the chemical energy driving force for processes like condensation or, in this context, hygroscopic absorption by a polymer. This energy can be related to an equivalent mechanical pressure, often called the osmotic pressure or swelling pressure, $\\Pi$. This pressure is the one that an ideal membrane would need to withstand to maintain equilibrium between the two states. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\Delta\\mu = -\\Pi v_w $$\nwhere $v_w$ is the partial molar volume of water. The negative sign indicates that a negative potential difference (as calculated) corresponds to a positive (compressive) pressure needed to prevent volume change.\n\nUsing the calculated $\\Delta\\mu$ and the provided value for $v_w$:\n$$ \\Pi = -\\frac{\\Delta\\mu}{v_w} = -\\frac{-1265.681\\ \\mathrm{J/mol}}{18.015 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^3/mol}} \\approx 7.027 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{J/m^3} $$\nSince $1\\ \\mathrm{J/m^3} = 1\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, the equivalent swelling pressure is $\\Pi \\approx 70.3\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nThis value of $\\approx 70\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ is a very large pressure. For comparison, soft polymer networks, such as hydrogels or elastomers, typically have elastic moduli in the range of $10\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$ to a few $\\mathrm{MPa}$ ($10^4 - 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$). The chemo-mechanical driving force for swelling is therefore one to two orders of magnitude larger than the mechanical stiffness of the material. This immense pressure forces water molecules into the polymer network, causing it to swell significantly until the internal elastic restoring force of the stretched polymer chains grows large enough to balance this swelling pressure and establish thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus, the magnitude of $\\Delta\\mu$ sets a powerful driving scale for hygroscopic swelling phenomena.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1266}$$", "id": "3497609"}, {"introduction": "When a material attempts to swell but is physically constrained, its expansion is converted into internal stress.

The bar is initially at a uniform moisture concentration $c_{0}$ and stress-free. The ambient environment is then changed and held long enough that the bar reaches a new uniform moisture concentration $c_{1}=c_{0}+\\Delta c$, with $\\Delta c>0$. The material exhibits linear hygroexpansion: under free swelling, a change in moisture concentration $\\Delta c$ produces a free swelling strain $\\varepsilon_{h}=\\alpha\\,\\Delta c$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant hygroexpansion coefficient.

Do not substitute numerical values or attach units.", "solution": "The problem asks for the uniform axial stress in a fully constrained polymer bar that undergoes a uniform change in moisture concentration. We will derive this stress starting from the fundamental principles of continuum mechanics as specified.\n\nThe analysis is one-dimensional, considering only the axial direction, which we denote by the coordinate $x$.\n\nFirst, we consider the balance of linear momentum. In the quasi-static limit, inertial effects are negligible. The problem also states to neglect body forces. For a one-dimensional body, the balance of linear momentum reduces to:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the axial stress. Integrating this equation shows that the stress $\\sigma$ must be constant along the length of the bar.\n$$ \\sigma(x) = \\text{constant} $$\n\nNext, we establish the kinematics based on the small-strain assumption. The total strain, $\\varepsilon_{total}$, is additively decomposed into two components: the elastic strain, $\\varepsilon_{e}$, which is mechanically induced and generates stress, and the hygroexpansion strain, $\\varepsilon_{h}$, which is a non-mechanical eigenstrain caused by the change in moisture concentration.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{total} = \\varepsilon_{e} + \\varepsilon_{h} $$\n\nThe constitutive law for linear elasticity relates the stress exclusively to the elastic part of the strain. For a one-dimensional, isotropic material, this is given by Hooke's Law:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\varepsilon_{e} $$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material.\n\nThe problem specifies the form of the hygroexpansion strain (also known as hygroscopic strain or free swelling strain). It is linearly proportional to the change in moisture concentration, $\\Delta c = c_1 - c_0$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{h} = \\alpha \\Delta c $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of hygroexpansion. Since the final moisture concentration $c_1$ is uniform throughout the bar, $\\Delta c$ is constant, and therefore $\\varepsilon_{h}$ is also uniform along the length of the bar.\n\nFinally, we apply the kinematic boundary condition. The bar is constrained at both ends such that the total axial displacement is zero. The total elongation of the bar, $\\Delta L_{total}$, is the integral of the total strain over the initial length $L$:\n$$ \\Delta L_{total} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\varepsilon_{total} dx $$\nThe problem states that the total axial displacement is zero at each end after loading. For a bar of initial length $L$, this means the final length is also $L$, so the total elongation is zero.\n$$ \\Delta L_{total} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the integral expression:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\varepsilon_{total} dx = 0 $$\nSince the stress $\\sigma$ is uniform and the material is homogeneous, the elastic strain $\\varepsilon_{e} = \\sigma/E$ must also be uniform. As noted earlier, the hygroexpansion strain $\\varepsilon_{h}$ is also uniform. Consequently, the total strain $\\varepsilon_{total} = \\varepsilon_{e} + \\varepsilon_{h}$ is uniform along the length of the bar. The integral simplifies to:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{total} \\int_{0}^{L} dx = \\varepsilon_{total} L = 0 $$\nSince the initial length $L$ is non-zero, this implies that the total strain must be zero everywhere in the bar:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{total} = 0 $$\n\nNow we synthesize these equations. We start with the strain decomposition:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{total} = \\varepsilon_{e} + \\varepsilon_{h} $$\nApplying the kinematic constraint $\\varepsilon_{total} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = \\varepsilon_{e} + \\varepsilon_{h} $$\nThis allows us to express the elastic strain in terms of the hygroexpansion strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{e} = - \\varepsilon_{h} $$\nSubstitute the given expression for the hygroexpansion strain, $\\varepsilon_{h} = \\alpha \\Delta c$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{e} = - \\alpha \\Delta c $$\nThis is the elastic strain that must be generated by the mechanical constraints to counteract the free swelling and maintain the bar's original length.\n\nFinally, we use the constitutive law to find the stress $\\sigma$ resulting from this elastic strain:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\varepsilon_{e} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\varepsilon_{e}$:\n$$ \\sigma = E ( - \\alpha \\Delta c ) $$\n$$ \\sigma = -E \\alpha \\Delta c $$\n\nThis is the final expression for the uniform axial stress in the constrained bar. Given that $E > 0$, $\\alpha > 0$ (for a material that swells with moisture), and $\\Delta c > 0$ as specified, the stress $\\sigma$ is negative. According to the stated sign convention where tensile stress is positive, a negative stress is compressive.
