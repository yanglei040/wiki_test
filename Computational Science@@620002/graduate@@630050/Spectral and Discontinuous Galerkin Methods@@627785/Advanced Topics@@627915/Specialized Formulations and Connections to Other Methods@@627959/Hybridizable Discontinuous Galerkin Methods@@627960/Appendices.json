A quadrature rule exact to degree $2k-1$ can be constructed using $k$ points (e.g., $k$-point Gauss-Legendre rule). It is possible to construct a non-zero polynomial $p(x) \\in \\mathcal{P}^k(F)$ that has its roots at precisely these $k$ quadrature points. For such a polynomial, $w_h = p(x)$, the computed stabilization term would be zero, since $w_h$ is zero at all quadrature points. However, the true integral $\\int_F \\tau (w_h)^2 \\, dF$ is greater than zero.\n\nThis means that underintegration with a rule exact to degree $2k-1$ allows for non-zero functions in the kernel of the discrete stabilization term. This loss of positive-definiteness can break coercivity and lead to a singular global system. To rule out this failure mode, the quadrature rule must integrate the term $\\tau(w_h)^2$ exactly. Since this integrand is a polynomial of degree at most $2k$, the required polynomial degree threshold for the face quadrature is $m_F(k) = 2k$.\n\nThe final answer combines the results for $m_V(k)$ and $m_F(k)$.\n$m_V(k) = 2k$\n$m_F(k) = 2k$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2k & 2k\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3390918"}]}
