This function is defined as:\n$$\nu(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{for } x \\in [0, 0.3) \\\\ 1 & \\text{for } x \\in [0.3, 1] \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is a piecewise constant function with a single jump discontinuity at $x=0.3$. The magnitude of the jump is $|1-0|=1$.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Continuous Total Variation $TV(u)$**\n\nThe total variation of a function $u \\in L^{1}([0,1])$ is defined as the supremum of the sums of absolute differences over all finite partitions of the interval:\n$$\nTV(u) = \\sup_{\\mathcal{P}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|u(x_{i})-u(x_{i-1})\\right|\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}=\\{0=x_{0}<x_{1}<\\dots<x_{n}=1\\}$ is an arbitrary finite partition of $[0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the sum $S(\\mathcal{P}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|u(x_{i})-u(x_{i-1})\\right|$ for an arbitrary partition $\\mathcal{P}$. The function $u(x)$ is constant on the subintervals $[0, 0.3)$ and $[0.3, 1]$.\nLet us consider any partition $\\mathcal{P}=\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}\\}$. There must be some subinterval $[x_{k-1}, x_k]$ that contains the point of discontinuity $0.3$.\n\nLet's consider two cases for the partition $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nCase 1: The point $0.3$ is one of the partition points, say $x_k = 0.3$ for some $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\nFor any $i < k$, the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ is entirely within $[0, 0.3)$, so $u(x_{i-1}) = u(x_i) = 0$. Thus, $|u(x_i) - u(x_{i-1})| = 0$.\nFor any $i > k$, the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ is entirely within $[0.3, 1]$, so $u(x_{i-1}) = u(x_i) = 1$. Thus, $|u(x_i) - u(x_{i-1})| = 0$.\nThe only non-zero term in the sum can arise from the interval(s) adjacent to $x_k = 0.3$. In this case, the terms are $|u(x_k)-u(x_{k-1})|$ and $|u(x_{k+1})-u(x_k)|$.\nSince $x_{k-1} < x_k = 0.3$, we have $u(x_{k-1})=0$ and $u(x_k)=1$.\nSince $x_{k+1} > x_k = 0.3$, we have $u(x_{k+1})=1$ and $u(x_k)=1$.\nThe sum becomes:\n$$\nS(\\mathcal{P}) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} 0\\right) + |u(x_k) - u(x_{k-1})| + \\left(\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n} |u(x_i) - u(x_{i-1})|\\right) = |1 - 0| + |1-1| + \\dots = 1\n$$\nActually, let's be more precise with summation split:\n$$\nS(\\mathcal{P}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |u(x_i) - u(x_{i-1})| + \\sum_{i=k+1}^{n} |u(x_i) - u(x_{i-1})| = |u(x_k)-u(x_{k-1})| + 0 = |1-0| = 1\n$$\nSo if the partition includes $0.3$, the sum is exactly $1$.\n\nCase 2: The point $0.3$ is not a partition point. Then it must lie in the interior of some subinterval, say $x_{k-1} < 0.3 < x_k$.\nFor any $i < k$, the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ is in $[0, 0.3)$, where $u(x)=0$. So $|u(x_i) - u(x_{i-1})|=0$.\nFor any $i > k$, the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ is in $(0.3, 1]$, where $u(x)=1$. So $|u(x_i) - u(x_{i-1})|=0$.\nThe only non-zero term is for $i=k$:\n$$\n|u(x_k) - u(x_{k-1})|\n$$\nSince $x_{k-1} < 0.3$, we have $u(x_{k-1})=0$. Since $x_k > 0.3$, we have $u(x_k)=1$.\nThe term is $|1 - 0| = 1$.\nThus, $S(\\mathcal{P}) = 1$.\n\nIn every possible case, the sum $S(\\mathcal{P})$ is either $0$ (if the partition manages to have all its points on one side of $0.3$, which is impossible for a partition of $[0,1]$), or $1$. More formally, using the triangle inequality:\n$S(\\mathcal{P}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |u(x_i)-u(x_{i-1})| = |u(x_1)-u(x_0)| + \\dots + |u(x_n)-u(x_{n-1})| \\ge |(u(x_1)-u(x_0)) + \\dots + (u(x_n)-u(x_{n-1}))| = |u(x_n)-u(x_0)| = |u(1)-u(0)| = |1-0|=1$. This inequality is not generally true. A better argument is that $TV(u) = TV_{[0,0.3]}(u) + TV_{[0.3,1]}(u)+|u(0.3^+)-u(0.3^-)|$. Within the intervals of continuity, $u$ is constant, so its TV is 0. The jump term is $|1-0|=1$. But the problem asks us to use the sum definition.\n\nFrom the analysis of Case 1 and 2, any partition $\\mathcal{P}$ of $[0,1]$ that \"sees\" the discontinuity will yield a sum of $1$. For any partition $\\mathcal{P}$, we can form a refined partition $\\mathcal{P}' = \\mathcal{P} \\cup \\{0.3\\}$. It is a standard property that $S(\\mathcal{P}') \\ge S(\\mathcal{P})$. As shown in Case 1, $S(\\mathcal{P}')=1$. Therefore, for any partition $\\mathcal{P}$, $S(\\mathcal{P}) \\le 1$.\nSince we can find a partition for which the sum is $1$ (e.g., $\\mathcal{P}=\\{0, 0.5, 1\\}$), the supremum must be at least $1$.\nCombining these, $\\sup_{\\mathcal{P}} S(\\mathcal{P}) = 1$.\n$$\nTV(u) = 1\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Discrete Total Variation $TV_h(u)$ and its Limit**\n\nWe are given a uniform mesh of $[0,1]$ with $N \\ge 2$ cells $I_i = [(i-1)h, ih]$ where $h=1/N$. The cell averages are $\\bar{u}_i = \\frac{1}{h}\\int_{I_i} u(x) \\, dx$. The discrete total variation is $TV_h(u) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} |\\bar{u}_{i+1} - \\bar{u}_i|$.\n\nThe calculation of the cell averages $\\bar{u}_i$ depends on the position of the discontinuity at $x=0.3$ relative to the cell boundaries $ih$. Let $j_0 = \\lfloor 0.3N \\rfloor$ and let $\\theta = 0.3N - j_0$ be the fractional part, so $\\theta \\in [0, 1)$. The position of the discontinuity is $x=0.3 = (j_0+\\theta)/N = (j_0+\\theta)h$.\n\nCase A: The discontinuity falls on a cell boundary.\nThis occurs if $0.3N$ is an integer, which means $\\theta=0$. So $0.3 = j_0h$. This is possible if $N$ is a multiple of $10$.\nIn this case, the boundary is between cell $I_{j_0}$ and $I_{j_0+1}$.\nFor any cell $I_i$ with $i \\le j_0$, the interval is $[(i-1)h, ih] \\subseteq [0, j_0h] = [0, 0.3]$. On this interval, $u(x)=0$ (except possibly at $x=0.3$, which does not affect the integral). So, $\\bar{u}_i = 0$ for $i \\le j_0$.\nFor any cell $I_i$ with $i > j_0$, the interval is $[(i-1)h, ih] \\subseteq [j_0h, 1] = [0.3, 1]$. On this interval, $u(x)=1$. So, $\\bar{u}_i = 1$ for $i > j_0$.\nThe sequence of cell averages is $\\{0, \\dots, 0, 1, \\dots, 1\\}$, with the change occurring between $\\bar{u}_{j_0}=0$ and $\\bar{u}_{j_0+1}=1$.\nThe discrete total variation is:\n$$\nTV_h(u) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} |\\bar{u}_{i+1} - \\bar{u}_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^{j_0-1} |0-0| + |\\bar{u}_{j_0+1} - \\bar{u}_{j_0}| + \\sum_{i=j_0+1}^{N-1} |1-1| = |1-0| = 1\n$$\n\nCase B: The discontinuity falls in the interior of a cell.\nThis occurs if $0.3N$ is not an integer, so $\\theta \\in (0,1)$. The discontinuity at $x=0.3=(j_0+\\theta)h$ lies in the interior of cell $I_{j_0+1} = [j_0h, (j_0+1)h]$.\nLet's compute the cell averages:\nFor $i \\le j_0$, $I_i$ is entirely to the left of $0.3$. Thus, $\\bar{u}_i = 0$.\nFor $i > j_0+1$, $I_i$ is entirely to the right of $0.3$. Thus, $\\bar{u}_i = 1$.\nFor the cell $i=j_0+1$, the integral is split:\n$$\n\\bar{u}_{j_0+1} = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{j_0h}^{(j_0+1)h} u(x) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{h} \\left( \\int_{j_0h}^{0.3} 0 \\, dx + \\int_{0.3}^{(j_0+1)h} 1 \\, dx \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{u}_{j_0+1} = \\frac{1}{h} \\left( ((j_0+1)h) - 0.3 \\right) = j_0+1 - \\frac{0.3}{h} = j_0+1 - 0.3N\n$$\nSubstituting $0.3N = j_0+\\theta$, we get:\n$$\n\\bar{u}_{j_0+1} = j_0+1 - (j_0+\\theta) = 1-\\theta\n$$\nSince $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, we have $0 < \\bar{u}_{j_0+1} < 1$.\nThe sequence of cell averages is $\\{0, \\dots, 0, \\bar{u}_{j_0+1}, 1, \\dots, 1\\}$.\nThe only non-zero terms in the sum for $TV_h(u)$ are at the transitions:\n$$\nTV_h(u) = |\\bar{u}_{j_0+1} - \\bar{u}_{j_0}| + |\\bar{u}_{j_0+2} - \\bar{u}_{j_0+1}| = |(1-\\theta) - 0| + |1 - (1-\\theta)|\n$$\nSince $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, both $1-\\theta$ and $\\theta$ are positive.\n$$\nTV_h(u) = (1-\\theta) + \\theta = 1\n$$\n\nIn both cases, regardless of the position of the discontinuity relative to the mesh, the discrete total variation is exactly $1$. Therefore, $TV_h(u)=1$ for all integers $N \\ge 2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the limit as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} TV_h(u) = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} 1 = 1\n$$\n\nBoth the continuous total variation $TV(u)$ and the limit of the discrete total variation $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} TV_h(u)$ are equal to $1$. This is expected, as the discrete total variation of cell averages for a function of bounded variation converges to the continuous total variation as the mesh size goes to zero.\n\nThe single common value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3424304"}, {"introduction": "After understanding what total variation is, the next step is to design numerical schemes that provably do not increase it over time.

Since $(u_{i,s}-\\bar{u}_{i})$ is negative, dividing by it reverses the inequality: $\\theta_{i} \\leq \\frac{m_{i} - \\bar{u}_{i}}{u_{i,s} - \\bar{u}_{i}}$.\n\nWe need to find the most restrictive $\\theta_{i}$ that satisfies all conditions. First, let's calculate the differences $u_{i,s} - \\bar{u}_{i}$:\n$u_{i,1} - \\bar{u}_{i} = -\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{25}{36} = -\\frac{12}{36} - \\frac{25}{36} = -\\frac{37}{36}$\n$u_{i,2} - \\bar{u}_{i} = \\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{30}{36} - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{5}{36}$\n$u_{i,3} - \\bar{u}_{i} = \\frac{7}{6} - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{42}{36} - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{17}{36}$\n\nThe original nodal values $u_{i,1}=-\\frac{1}{3}$ and $u_{i,3}=\\frac{7}{6}$ are outside the bounds $[0,1]$, so limiting is necessary, which means $\\theta_{i}<1$.\nWe compute the upper limits on $\\theta_i$ for the out-of-bounds nodes:\nFor $s=1$, since $u_{i,1} < \\bar{u}_i$:\n$$\n\\theta_{i} \\leq \\frac{m_{i} - \\bar{u}_{i}}{u_{i,1} - \\bar{u}_{i}} = \\frac{0 - \\frac{25}{36}}{-\\frac{37}{36}} = \\frac{25}{37}\n$$\nFor $s=3$, since $u_{i,3} > \\bar{u}_i$:\n$$\n\\theta_{i} \\leq \\frac{M_{i} - \\bar{u}_{i}}{u_{i,3} - \\bar{u}_{i}} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{25}{36}}{\\frac{17}{36}} = \\frac{\\frac{11}{36}}{\\frac{17}{36}} = \\frac{11}{17}\n$$\nThe node $u_{i,2}$ is already within bounds, but we can check its constraint:\nFor $s=2$, since $u_{i,2} > \\bar{u}_i$:\n$$\n\\theta_{i} \\leq \\frac{M_{i} - \\bar{u}_{i}}{u_{i,2} - \\bar{u}_{i}} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{25}{36}}{\\frac{5}{36}} = \\frac{\\frac{11}{36}}{\\frac{5}{36}} = \\frac{11}{5}\n$$\nTo satisfy all constraints, we must choose the minimum of these values:\n$\\theta_{i} = \\min\\left(\\frac{25}{37}, \\frac{11}{17}, \\frac{11}{5}\\right)$.\nComparing $\\frac{25}{37}$ and $\\frac{11}{17}$: $25 \\times 17 = 425$ and $11 \\times 37 = 407$. Since $407 < 425$, we have $\\frac{11}{17} < \\frac{25}{37}$.\nClearly, $\\frac{11}{17} < 1 < \\frac{11}{5}$. Thus, the most restrictive value is $\\theta_i = \\frac{11}{17}$.\n\nNow we compute the changes in nodal values, $\\Delta u_{i,s} = u_{i,s}^{\\mathrm{new}} - u_{i,s}$.\nFrom the rescaling formula, $u_{i,s}^{\\mathrm{new}} - u_{i,s} = \\bar{u}_i + \\theta_i(u_{i,s}-\\bar{u}_i) - u_{i,s} = (\\theta_i-1)(u_{i,s}-\\bar{u}_i)$.\nWith $\\theta_{i} = \\frac{11}{17}$, we have $\\theta_{i}-1 = -\\frac{6}{17}$.\n$$\n\\Delta u_{i,1} = \\left(-\\frac{6}{17}\\right) (u_{i,1}-\\bar{u}_{i}) = \\left(-\\frac{6}{17}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{37}{36}\\right) = \\frac{6 \\times 37}{17 \\times 36} = \\frac{37}{17 \\times 6} = \\frac{37}{102}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta u_{i,2} = \\left(-\\frac{6}{17}\\right) (u_{i,2}-\\bar{u}_{i}) = \\left(-\\frac{6}{17}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{36}\\right) = -\\frac{6 \\times 5}{17 \\times 36} = -\\frac{5}{17 \\times 6} = -\\frac{5}{102}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta u_{i,3} = \\left(-\\frac{6}{17}\\right) (u_{i,3}-\\bar{u}_{i}) = \\left(-\\frac{6}{17}\\right)\\left(\\frac{17}{36}\\right) = -\\frac{6 \\times 17}{17 \\times 36} = -\\frac{6}{36} = -\\frac{1}{6} = -\\frac{17}{102}\n$$\nThe changes in the nodal degrees of freedom are $\\Delta u_{i,1} = \\frac{37}{102}$, $\\Delta u_{i,2} = -\\frac{5}{102}$, and $\\Delta u_{i,3} = -\\frac{17}{102}$.\n\nFinally, we determine the change in the Total Variation (TV) of the cell averages, $\\Delta\\mathrm{TV}(\\{\\bar{u}_{j}\\})$. The TV is defined as $\\mathrm{TV}(\\{\\bar{u}_{j}\\}) = \\sum_{j}|\\bar{u}_{j+1}-\\bar{u}_{j}|$. The change is $\\Delta\\mathrm{TV} = \\mathrm{TV}_{\\text{new}} - \\mathrm{TV}_{\\text{old}}$.\nThe rescaling formula $u_{i,s}^{\\mathrm{new}}=\\bar{u}_{i}+\\theta_{i}(u_{i,s}-\\bar{u}_{i})$ is conservative, meaning $\\bar{u}_{i}^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\bar{u}_{i}$. The problem states that cell averages in all other cells remain unchanged, i.e., $\\bar{u}_{j}^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\bar{u}_{j}$ for all $j \\neq i$.\nCombining these facts, we have $\\bar{u}_{j}^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\bar{u}_{j}$ for all cells $j$.\nTherefore, the new TV is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TV}_{\\text{new}} = \\sum_{j}|\\bar{u}_{j+1}^{\\mathrm{new}}-\\bar{u}_{j}^{\\mathrm{new}}| = \\sum_{j}|\\bar{u}_{j+1}-\\bar{u}_{j}| = \\mathrm{TV}_{\\text{old}}\n$$\nThe change in the total variation of the cell averages is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathrm{TV} = \\mathrm{TV}_{\\text{new}} - \\mathrm{TV}_{\\text{old}} = 0\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{37}{102} & -\\frac{5}{102} & -\\frac{17}{102} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3424321"}]}
