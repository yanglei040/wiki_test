A polynomial $p(x,y)$ is in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ if it can be written as $p(x,y) = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^j$, where for all terms with non-zero coefficients $c_{ij} \\neq 0$, the exponents satisfy the inequality $i+j \\le N$. The exponents $i$ and $j$ are non-negative integers.\n\nThe space $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is the tensor-product polynomial space, which consists of all bivariate polynomials whose degree in each variable is at most $N$. A polynomial $p(x,y)$ is in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ if it can be written as $p(x,y) = \\sum_{i=0}^N \\sum_{j=0}^N c_{ij} x^i y^j$. Equivalently, for a general polynomial representation $p(x,y) = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^j$, it belongs to $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ if for all terms with $c_{ij} \\neq 0$, the exponents satisfy the two inequalities $i \\le N$ and $j \\le N$.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. The first part asks for the construction of a specific polynomial. The second part requires a proof of existence or non-existence.\n\n### Part 1: Construction of a polynomial in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$\n\nWe are tasked with finding a nonzero polynomial $f(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y) \\in Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ and $f(x,y) \\notin P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. This means $f(x,y)$ must satisfy the conditions for being in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ while simultaneously failing the condition for being in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.\n\nLet us consider a simple monomial, $f(x,y) = x^i y^j$, where $i$ and $j$ are non-negative integers.\n-   For $f(x,y)$ to be in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$, its exponents must satisfy $i \\le N$ and $j \\le N$.\n-   For $f(x,y)$ to *not* be in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$, its total degree must be greater than $N$, so its exponents must satisfy $i+j > N$.\n\nWe need to find a pair of integers $(i,j)$ that satisfies these three inequalities, given that $N \\ge 2$. A simple and effective strategy is to choose the largest possible values for $i$ and $j$ that are consistent with the conditions for membership in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. Let us select $i=N$ and $j=N$.\n\nWe propose the polynomial $f(x,y) = x^N y^N$. Now, we must justify that this choice is correct based on the degree definitions.\n\n1.  **Verification of membership in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$**: The polynomial $f(x,y) = x^N y^N$ has only one term. The degree of this term in the variable $x$ is $N$, which satisfies the condition $i \\le N$. The degree in the variable $y$ is also $N$, which satisfies the condition $j \\le N$. Therefore, by definition, $f(x,y) \\in Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.\n\n2.  **Verification of exclusion from $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$**: The total degree of the monomial $x^i y^j$ is $i+j$. For our chosen polynomial $f(x,y) = x^N y^N$, the total degree is $N+N = 2N$. For a polynomial to be in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$, the total degree of all its terms must be at most $N$. In our case, this would require $2N \\le N$. This inequality holds only if $N \\le 0$. However, the problem statement specifies that $N \\ge 2$. For any integer $N \\ge 2$, it is true that $2N > N$. Since the total degree of $f(x,y)$ is $2N$, which is strictly greater than $N$, the polynomial $f(x,y)$ is not in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.\n\nWe have thus constructed a nonzero polynomial, $f(x,y) = x^N y^N$, that is in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ but not in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\n### Part 2: Existence of a polynomial in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$\n\nWe are asked to determine if there exists any nonzero polynomial $g(x,y)$ such that $g(x,y) \\in P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ and $g(x,y) \\notin Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. This is equivalent to asking whether the inclusion $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\subseteq Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is true. If it is, then the set difference $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is empty.\n\nLet $g(x,y)$ be an arbitrary polynomial in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. By definition, $g(x,y)$ is a linear combination of monomials $x^i y^j$:\n$$g(x,y) = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x^i y^j$$\nwhere for any term with $c_{ij} \\neq 0$, the exponents must satisfy the total degree constraint:\n$$i+j \\le N$$\nSince exponents of a polynomial are non-negative integers, we also have $i \\ge 0$ and $j \\ge 0$.\n\nFrom the inequality $i+j \\le N$, we can derive constraints on the individual exponents $i$ and $j$.\nSince $j \\ge 0$, it follows that $i \\le N - j$. The maximum possible value of $N-j$ occurs when $j$ is at its minimum, which is $j=0$. Thus, $i \\le N-0$, which implies $i \\le N$.\n$$i+j \\le N \\text{ and } j \\ge 0 \\implies i \\le N-j \\le N$$\nSimilarly, since $i \\ge 0$, it follows that $j \\le N - i$. The maximum possible value of $N-i$ occurs when $i$ is at its minimum, which is $i=0$. Thus, $j \\le N-0$, which implies $j \\le N$.\n$$i+j \\le N \\text{ and } i \\ge 0 \\implies j \\le N-i \\le N$$\n\nSo, for any term $c_{ij}x^i y^j$ with $c_{ij} \\ne 0$ in an arbitrary polynomial $g(x,y) \\in P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$, the exponents must satisfy both $i \\le N$ and $j \\le N$.\n\nThis pair of inequalities, $i \\le N$ and $j \\le N$, is precisely the condition for a polynomial's monomials to belong to the space $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. As this holds for all terms of $g(x,y)$, the polynomial $g(x,y)$ itself must be an element of $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.\n\nThis demonstrates that any polynomial that is in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is necessarily also in $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. In other words, $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ is a subset of $Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$. Therefore, the set difference $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$ contains no elements; it is the empty set.\n\nConclusion: No nonzero polynomial $g(x,y)$ exists in $P^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square}) \\setminus Q^N(\\hat{K}_{\\square})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x^N y^N}$$", "id": "3402568"}, {"introduction": "Once a polynomial space is chosen, we represent functions by interpolating them at a set of nodes.

I will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires two main steps: first, to derive the standard supremum-norm interpolation error bound, and second, to apply this result to the context of nodal DG methods.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Interpolation Error Bound**\n\nThe analysis starts with determining the operator norm of the interpolation operator $I_N$ from the space of continuous functions $C([-1,1])$ to itself, equipped with the supremum norm $\\|u\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x\\in[-1,1]}|u(x)|$.\n\nThe operator norm is defined as $\\|I_N\\|_{C\\to C} = \\sup_{u\\in C([-1,1]), u\\neq 0} \\frac{\\|I_N u\\|_{\\infty}}{\\|u\\|_{\\infty}}$.\n\nFor any $u \\in C([-1,1])$, we have:\n$$\n\\|I_N u\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x\\in[-1,1]} \\left| \\sum_{j=0}^{N} u(x_j) \\ell_j(x) \\right|\n$$\nUsing the triangle inequality and the definition of the supremum norm:\n$$\n\\left| \\sum_{j=0}^{N} u(x_j) \\ell_j(x) \\right| \\le \\sum_{j=0}^{N} |u(x_j)| |\\ell_j(x)| \\le \\sum_{j=0}^{N} \\|u\\|_{\\infty} |\\ell_j(x)| = \\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\sum_{j=0}^{N} |\\ell_j(x)| = \\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\Lambda_N(x)\n$$\nTaking the supremum over $x \\in [-1,1]$ on both sides gives:\n$$\n\\|I_N u\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\sup_{x\\in[-1,1]} \\Lambda_N(x) = \\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\nThis establishes that $\\|I_N\\|_{C\\to C} \\le \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$.\n\nTo prove equality, we must construct a function for which this bound is attained. Let $x^* \\in [-1,1]$ be a point where the continuous function $\\Lambda_N(x)$ achieves its maximum, i.e., $\\Lambda_N(x^*) = \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$. Consider a continuous function $u^* \\in C([-1,1])$ such that $\\|u^*\\|_{\\infty}=1$ and $u^*(x_j) = \\mathrm{sgn}(\\ell_j(x^*))$ for each node $x_j$. Such a function exists (e.g., by piecewise linear construction or the Tietze extension theorem). For this function $u^*$, we evaluate the interpolant at $x=x^*$:\n$$\nI_N u^*(x^*) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} u^*(x_j) \\ell_j(x^*) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} \\mathrm{sgn}(\\ell_j(x^*)) \\ell_j(x^*) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} |\\ell_j(x^*)| = \\Lambda_N(x^*) = \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\nThus, $\\|I_N u^*\\|_{\\infty} \\ge |I_N u^*(x^*)| = \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$. Since we already know $\\|I_N u^*\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty} \\|u^*\\|_{\\infty} = \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$, we must have equality. This proves that $\\|I_N\\|_{C\\to C} = \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$.\n\nNext, we derive the error bound for $u - I_N u$. Let $p \\in \\mathbb{P}_N$ be an arbitrary polynomial of degree at most $N$. A fundamental property of the interpolation operator is that it is a projection onto $\\mathbb{P}_N$, meaning $I_N p = p$ for any $p \\in \\mathbb{P}_N$. This follows because $p(x) - I_N p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $N$ that vanishes at the $N+1$ distinct points $\\{x_j\\}$, and must therefore be the zero polynomial.\n\nUsing this property and the linearity of $I_N$, we can write the error as:\n$$\nu - I_N u = u - p + p - I_N u = (u - p) + (I_N p - I_N u) = (u - p) - I_N(u - p)\n$$\nApplying the triangle inequality and the operator norm property:\n$$\n\\|u - I_N u\\|_{\\infty} = \\|(u - p) - I_N(u - p)\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\|u - p\\|_{\\infty} + \\|I_N(u - p)\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n\\|u - I_N u\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\|u - p\\|_{\\infty} + \\|I_N\\|_{C\\to C} \\|u - p\\|_{\\infty} = (1 + \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}) \\|u - p\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\nThis inequality holds for any $p \\in \\mathbb{P}_N$. To obtain the tightest bound, we choose the polynomial that best approximates $u$ in the supremum norm, leading to the celebrated result:\n$$\n\\|u - I_N u\\|_{\\infty} \\le (1 + \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}) \\inf_{p \\in \\mathbb{P}_N} \\|u - p\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\nThis bound separates the interpolation error into two parts: the best approximation error, $\\inf_{p \\in \\mathbb{P}_N} \\|u - p\\|_{\\infty}$, which depends on the smoothness of the function $u$, and the stability factor, $(1 + \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty})$, which depends only on the geometry of the nodal set $\\{x_j\\}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of Nodal Sets and Application to Nodal DG**\n\nThe stability and accuracy of the interpolation scheme are critically dependent on the growth of the Lebesgue constant $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ as the polynomial degree $N$ increases.\n-   **Equispaced nodes** ($x_j = -1 + 2j/N$): It is a classical result that for equispaced points, the Lebesgue constant grows exponentially with $N$: $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty} \\sim \\frac{2^{N+1}}{eN\\log N}$. This rapid growth can overwhelm the decay of the best approximation error even for analytic functions, leading to large oscillations and divergence of the interpolant (the Runge phenomenon).\n-   **Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes** ($x_j = \\cos(j\\pi/N)$): These nodes correspond to the extrema of the Chebyshev polynomial $T_N(x)$ and include the endpoints $\\pm 1$. For these points, the Lebesgue constant exhibits near-optimal logarithmic growth: $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty} = O(\\log N)$.\n-   **Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre nodes**: These nodes, which are the roots of Legendre polynomials or their derivatives, are typically used in DG and spectral methods. They also feature slow, logarithmic growth: $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty} = O(\\log N)$.\n\nIn a nodal DG method, the solution on each physical element $K$ is represented by a polynomial from $\\mathbb{P}_N$. This polynomial is constructed by mapping the reference element $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ to $K$ via a mapping, typically an affine map $F_K: E_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\to K$. The interpolation error analysis on the reference element transfers directly to each physical element. For an affine map, the supremum norm is invariant, i.e., $\\|v\\|_{L^\\infty(K)} = \\|v \\circ F_K\\|_{L^\\infty(E_{\\mathrm{ref}})}$. Consequently, the interpolation error bound on element $K$ is:\n$$\n\\|u - I_N^K u\\|_{L^\\infty(K)} \\le (1 + \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}) \\inf_{p \\in \\mathbb{P}_N(K)} \\|u - p\\|_{L^\\infty(K)}\n$$\nThe crucial observation is that the stability factor $(1 + \\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty})$ is determined *solely* by the choice of nodes on the reference element and is the same for all elements in the mesh. Therefore, choosing a nodal set with slow growth of $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ (like Gauss-type points) ensures that interpolation is stable across the entire computational domain. This allows the DG method to achieve an error close to the best possible polynomial approximation error on each element. For smooth solutions, where the best approximation error decays exponentially in $N$, this stable interpolation scheme enables *spectral accuracy*. Conversely, using a set with exponential growth in $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ (like equispaced points) would destroy this property, making high-order methods unstable and inaccurate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The interpolation operator $I_N$ has operator norm $\\|I_N\\|_{C\\to C}=\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ in the supremum norm, and combining linearity with the triangle inequality yields $\\|u-I_N u\\|_{\\infty}\\le (1+\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty})\\,\\inf_{p\\in\\mathbb{P}_N}\\|u-p\\|_{\\infty}$. In nodal DG, choosing Gauss–Legendre or Gauss–Lobatto points (for which $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ grows like $O(\\log N)$) keeps interpolation stable so that near-best approximation is retained; by contrast, equispaced points have Lebesgue constants that grow exponentially in $N$, which can amplify interpolation error and degrade or even destroy high-order accuracy unless mitigation (for example, filtering or projection) is applied.**\n\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. It correctly states the operator norm, the error bound, the growth rates of the Lebesgue constant for good (Gauss-type) and bad (equispaced) points, and the resulting consequences for stability and accuracy.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because $I_N$ is a projection onto $\\mathbb{P}_N$, its operator norm in the supremum norm equals $1$, and thus $\\|u-I_N u\\|_{\\infty}\\le (1-\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty})\\,\\inf_{p\\in\\mathbb{P}_N}\\|u-p\\|_{\\infty}$. Moreover, for equispaced points one has $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}=O(N^{-1})$, so equispaced interpolation is uniformly stable.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple fundamental errors. First, being a projection does not imply having a norm of $1$ in the supremum norm; in fact, $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty} > 1$ for $N \\ge 1$. Second, the error bound formula has an incorrect sign and structure. A factor of $(1-\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty})$ would be negative and nonsensical. Third, the claim that $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}=O(N^{-1})$ for equispaced points is false; the growth is exponential. Consequently, the conclusion that equispaced interpolation is stable is the opposite of the truth.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In Discontinuous Galerkin, the Lebesgue constant only influences numerical flux consistency at element interfaces; volume interpolation and aliasing errors are unaffected because the mass matrix is diagonal for arbitrary nodal sets, making the choice of nodes irrelevant to accuracy.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The Lebesgue constant is central to the quality of *volume* interpolation within each element, as shown by the error bound. The mass matrix is not diagonal for arbitrary nodal sets; its diagonalization (lumping) is a special feature achieved when interpolation nodes coincide with quadrature points of a suitable rule (e.g., Gauss-Lobatto). The choice of nodes is of paramount importance for the accuracy and stability of the entire method.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The Lebesgue constant acts as a stability factor for interpolation on each element: under affine mappings from $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ to a physical element, the supremum-norm interpolation bound transfers up to simple Jacobian scaling in the norm definition. Consequently, using nodal sets with moderate growth of $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ (for example, $O(\\log N)$) supports near-best interpolation and enables spectral-in-$N$ accuracy for analytic solutions in nodal DG, while large $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ undermines these properties.**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies the role of the Lebesgue constant as a stability factor. It correctly states the crucial property for DG methods: the stability analysis on the reference element transfers to all physical elements via mapping. The stability factor $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ itself is invariant under affine mapping. The statement correctly links the moderate growth of $\\|\\Lambda_N\\|_{\\infty}$ to achieving near-best approximation and spectral accuracy for smooth solutions, and correctly identifies that large growth undermines these goals. The phrasing concerning \"Jacobian scaling in the norm definition\" is a slightly informal but conceptually acceptable way to acknowledge that the approximation term $\\inf\\|u-p\\|_{\\infty}$ depends on the element size, which is related to the Jacobian of the mapping.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth statements A and D are correct, as they describe true and central aspects of the theory requested in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3402557"}, {"introduction": "To make the theory of stable interpolation concrete, this problem provides a direct computational experience with a well-behaved nodal set.

Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre nodes and Lagrange interpolation are standard, well-established concepts.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The degree $N$, the nodal set (GLL), the function $f(x)$, and the evaluation point $x$ are all specified, which uniquely determines the Lagrange interpolant and the associated error.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and mathematical, free of any subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution follows.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the GLL nodes and then constructing the Lagrange interpolating polynomial. A key simplification arises from the symmetry properties of the function and the nodal set.\n\nFirst, we determine the $N+1=5$ Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre (GLL) nodes, denoted $\\{\\xi_j\\}_{j=0}^4$, on the reference interval $[-1, 1]$ for polynomial degree $N=4$. The endpoints are $\\xi_0 = -1$ and $\\xi_4 = 1$. The interior nodes are the roots of the derivative of the Legendre polynomial of degree $N=4$, $L_4(x)$.\nThe Legendre polynomial of degree $4$ is $L_4(x) = \\frac{1}{8}(35x^4 - 30x^2 + 3)$.\nIts derivative is $L'_4(x) = \\frac{1}{8}(140x^3 - 60x) = \\frac{5}{2}x(7x^2 - 3)$.\nThe roots of $L'_4(x)=0$ are $x=0$ and $7x^2 - 3 = 0$, which gives $x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}$.\nArranging the nodes in ascending order:\n$\\xi_0 = -1$\n$\\xi_1 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}$\n$\\xi_2 = 0$\n$\\xi_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}$\n$\\xi_4 = 1$\n\nThe target function is $f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. This is an odd function, since $f(-x) = \\sin(-\\pi x) = -\\sin(\\pi x) = -f(x)$. The set of GLL nodes is symmetric with respect to the origin, i.e., $\\xi_{N-j} = -\\xi_j$. A fundamental property of Lagrange interpolation is that if the function is odd and the interpolation nodes are symmetric, the resulting interpolating polynomial, $I_N f(x)$, is also odd.\n\nFor $N=4$, the interpolating polynomial is of degree at most $4$. As an odd polynomial, it can only contain terms with odd powers of $x$:\n$I_4 f(x) = c_1 x + c_3 x^3$.\n\nWe determine the coefficients $c_1$ and $c_3$ by enforcing the interpolation condition $I_4 f(\\xi_j) = f(\\xi_j)$ at the nodes.\nAt node $\\xi_4 = 1$:\n$I_4 f(1) = c_1(1) + c_3(1)^3 = c_1 + c_3$.\n$f(1) = \\sin(\\pi \\cdot 1) = 0$.\nThus, $c_1 + c_3 = 0$, which implies $c_3 = -c_1$. The interpolant simplifies to:\n$I_4 f(x) = c_1(x - x^3) = c_1 x(1-x^2)$.\nNote that this form automatically satisfies the conditions at $\\xi_0=-1$ and $\\xi_2=0$, as $I_4 f(-1)=c_1(-1 - (-1)^3)=0=f(-1)$ and $I_4 f(0)=c_1(0)=0=f(0)$.\n\nTo find $c_1$, we use a non-zero interior node, for instance $\\xi_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}$.\n$I_4 f\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) = c_1 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}} - \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right)^3\\right) = c_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}} \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{7}\\right) = c_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}} \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)$.\nThe function value is $f\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right)$.\nEquating these gives:\n$c_1 \\frac{4}{7}\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}} = \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right)$.\nSolving for $c_1$:\n$c_1 = \\frac{7}{4\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) = \\frac{7\\sqrt{7}}{4\\sqrt{3}} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) = \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{12} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right)$.\n\nSo the interpolating polynomial is:\n$I_4 f(x) = \\left( \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{12} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) \\right) (x - x^3)$.\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this at $x=0.3 = \\frac{3}{10}$.\nFirst, we compute the term $(x-x^3)$:\n$x - x^3 = x(1-x^2) = \\frac{3}{10}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{3}{10}\\left(1 - \\frac{9}{100}\\right) = \\frac{3}{10}\\left(\\frac{91}{100}\\right) = \\frac{273}{1000}$.\n\nNow, we compute $I_4 f(0.3)$:\n$I_4 f(0.3) = \\left( \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{12} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) \\right) \\left(\\frac{273}{1000}\\right)$.\nSince $273 = 3 \\times 91 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 13$, we can simplify:\n$I_4 f(0.3) = \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{12} \\frac{3 \\times 7 \\times 13}{1000} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) = \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{4} \\frac{7 \\times 13}{1000} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right)$.\n$I_4 f(0.3) = \\frac{49 \\times 13 \\sqrt{21}}{4000} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) = \\frac{637\\sqrt{21}}{4000} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right)$.\n\nNext, we calculate the exact value of the function at $x=0.3$.\n$f(0.3) = \\sin(0.3\\pi) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{10}\\right)$.\nUsing the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta)$:\n$f(0.3) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3\\pi}{10}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi - 3\\pi}{10}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{10}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5}\\right)$.\nThe exact value for $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{5})$ is $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\nSo, $f(0.3) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\n\nFinally, the pointwise interpolation error is the absolute difference between the interpolated value and the exact value:\nError $= |I_4 f(0.3) - f(0.3)| = \\left| \\frac{637\\sqrt{21}}{4000} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) - \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\right|$.\nThis is the required single closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left| \\frac{637\\sqrt{21}}{4000} \\sin\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{7}}\\right) - \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\right|}$$", "id": "3402592"}]}
