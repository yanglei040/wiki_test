No rounding is required. Do not include units.", "solution": "The problem requires us to analyze the phenomenon of aliasing in the context of a pseudospectral method. We are given two sinusoidal functions, $u(x)$ and $v(x)$, and we need to determine the wavenumber of the sum-harmonic in their product, $w(x)=u(x)v(x)$, under two different computational scenarios.\n\nThe functions are given by $u(x) = \\sin(kx)$ and $v(x) = \\sin(\\ell x)$, with integer wavenumbers $k=\\frac{N}{2}-1$ and $\\ell=\\frac{N}{2}-2$. Here, $N$ is the number of equispaced grid points on the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ and is an even integer.\n\nFirst, we establish the analytical form of the product $w(x)$ using the trigonometric product-to-sum identity:\n$$ \\sin(A)\\sin(B) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\cos(A-B) - \\cos(A+B)\\right] $$\nApplying this identity to $w(x)=u(x)v(x)$, we get:\n$$ w(x) = \\sin(kx)\\sin(\\ell x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\cos((k-\\ell)x) - \\cos((k+\\ell)x)\\right] $$\nThis shows that the product $w(x)$ is a superposition of two cosine waves. The wavenumbers of these components are the difference-harmonic, $m_{\\text{diff}} = k-\\ell$, and the sum-harmonic, $m_{\\text{sum}} = k+\\ell$.\n\nSubstituting the given values for $k$ and $\\ell$:\n$$ m_{\\text{diff}} = k-\\ell = \\left(\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right) - \\left(\\frac{N}{2}-2\\right) = 1 $$\n$$ m_{\\text{sum}} = k+\\ell = \\left(\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{N}{2}-2\\right) = N-3 $$\nSo, the exact analytical product is $w(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\cos(x) - \\cos((N-3)x)\\right]$. The high-frequency sum-harmonic corresponds to the term $\\cos((N-3)x)$, which is composed of complex exponentials with wavenumbers $\\pm(N-3)$.\n\n**Part 1: Aliased Wavenumber on an $N$-point Grid**\n\nA pseudospectral method on an $N$-point grid can only represent a finite set of wavenumbers without ambiguity. The problem specifies this set, the principal set, as $\\{-\\frac{N}{2}+1, \\dots, \\frac{N}{2}\\}$. Any wavenumber $m$ outside this set is aliased to a wavenumber $m_{\\text{alias}}$ inside the set, where $m_{\\text{alias}}$ is congruent to $m$ modulo $N$. That is, $m_{\\text{alias}} = m + qN$ for some integer $q$ such that $m_{\\text{alias}}$ is in the principal set.\n\nThe high-frequency sum-harmonic has a true wavenumber of $m = N-3$. We need to find its alias in the principal set. We are looking for an integer $q$ such that $-\\frac{N}{2}+1 \\le (N-3) + qN \\le \\frac{N}{2}$.\nChoosing $q=-1$, we get:\n$$ m_{\\text{alias}} = (N-3) - N = -3 $$\nWe must verify that this aliased wavenumber lies within the principal set $\\{-\\frac{N}{2}+1, \\dots, \\frac{N}{2}\\}$. The condition is $-\\frac{N}{2}+1 \\le -3$. This simplifies to $4 \\le \\frac{N}{2}$, or $N \\ge 8$. The problem is posed for a general even $N$, and the wavenumbers $k$ and $\\ell$ are chosen to be close to the Nyquist frequency $\\frac{N}{2}$, which is characteristic of scenarios where aliasing is a major concern. For small $N$ (e.g., $N=4$ or $N=6$), the sum-harmonic $N-3$ might fall within the principal set, meaning no aliasing occurs for that specific component. However, the general case, implied by the context of aliasing control rules, is for $N$ sufficiently large that the sum-harmonic falls outside the representable range. Thus, assuming $N \\ge 8$, the aliased wavenumber from the sum-harmonic $k+\\ell=N-3$ is $m_{\\text{alias}} = -3$.\n\n**Part 2: Unaliased Wavenumber using the Three-Halves Rule**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the unaliased, true wavenumber of the sum-harmonic. The context provided is the \"three-halves\" dealiasing rule, a procedure designed to compute nonlinear products without aliasing. The procedure involves padding the spectral representation of the functions with zeros to increase the resolution, performing the product on a finer physical grid ($P=\\frac{3N}{2}$ points), and then transforming back.\n\nThe question is: \"identify the unaliased high-frequency wavenumber index of the sum-harmonic prior to truncation (that is, the true sum-harmonic index on the integer wavenumber line)\". The parenthetical part of this question explicitly defines the desired quantity: it is the true wavenumber of the sum-harmonic component as it exists in the analytical product, before any discrete grid effects (like aliasing) are considered. This dealiasing procedure is the tool one would use to attempt to compute this true value numerically. The question asks for the theoretical target of this computation.\n\nAs determined from the product-to-sum identity, the true sum-harmonic is $m_{\\text{sum}} = k+\\ell$.\n$$ m_{\\text{true}} = k+\\ell = \\left(\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{N}{2}-2\\right) = N-3 $$\nThis is the wavenumber of the high-frequency component in the exact solution. The purpose of the dealiasing rule is to accurately capture this component. While for the specific high wavenumbers given, the $P=\\frac{3N}{2}$ grid may not be sufficient to prevent aliasing if $N > 12$ (since the true wavenumber $N-3$ would exceed the padded grid's Nyquist limit of $P/2 = 3N/4$), the question is asking for the value that this procedure *intends* to find, which is the true analytical wavenumber.\n\nTherefore, the true high-frequency sum-harmonic index is $m_{\\text{true}} = N-3$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\nThe aliased wavenumber index on the $N$-point grid is $m_{\\text{alias}} = -3$.\nThe true high-frequency sum-harmonic index is $m_{\\text{true}} = N-3$.\n\nThe final answer is requested as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} m_{\\text{alias}} & m_{\\text{true}} \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & N-3 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3423339"}, {"introduction": "Moving from Fourier methods to the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework, this exercise challenges you to apply the core principles of aliasing control in a new context.

According to the problem statement, the GLL quadrature with $n_q$ points is exact for polynomial integrands of degree up to $2n_q - 3$.

Since $N+1 < \\frac{3}{2}(N+1)$ for any $N \\ge 1$ (and it is trivially true for $N=0$), the standard quadrature is insufficient. Therefore, overintegration according to the three-halves rule is required for the quadratic reaction term to avoid aliasing.\n\n**2.

Thus, for standard DG, we have $n_q = N+1$. This choice exactly satisfies the condition $n_q \\ge N+1$. Therefore, the standard quadrature is sufficient to integrate the advection term's volume integral exactly, and no overintegration is needed.\n\n(Note: If one were to use the \"weak\" form of the advection integral, $-\\int_{\\Omega_k} (a u_h) (\\partial_x v_h) dx$, the integrand $u_h (\\partial_x v_h)$ would also have a degree of $N + (N-1) = 2N-1$, leading to the same conclusion.)\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**\n\n-   The quadratic reaction term gives rise to a polynomial integrand of degree $3N$, which requires $n_q \\ge \\frac{3}{2}(N+1)$ points for exact integration. This necessitates applying the three-halves overintegration rule.\n-   The linear advection term gives rise to a polynomial integrand of degree $2N-1$, which requires $n_q \\ge N+1$ points. This is exactly satisfied by the standard choice of $n_q=N+1$ quadrature points, so no overintegration is needed for this term.\n\n### Option Evaluation\n\n**A. Both the quadratic reaction term $R(u_h)$ and the linear advective flux require three-halves overintegration to avoid aliasing in the volume integrals for degree-$N$ DG.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. As derived, the linear advective flux term produces an integrand of degree $2N-1$, which is integrated exactly by the standard $n_q = N+1$ quadrature. It does not require three-halves overintegration.\n\n**B. Only the quadratic reaction term $R(u_h)$ requires three-halves overintegration; the linear advective flux is integrated exactly by the standard $n_q = N+1$ Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre quadrature, so no overintegration is needed for advection.**\nThis is **Correct**. This statement accurately reflects the derived results. The reaction term needs $n_q \\ge \\frac{3}{2}(N+1)$, while the advection term needs only $n_q \\ge N+1$, which is met by the standard quadrature.\n\n**C. Only the advective flux requires three-halves overintegration because the derivative in $\\partial_x u_h$ increases the polynomial degree beyond the exactness limit of $n_q = N+1$ Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre quadrature.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. This statement contains two fundamental errors. First, differentiation of a polynomial *decreases* its degree, it does not increase it. Second, it is the reaction term, not the advection term, that requires overintegration.\n\n**D. Neither term requires overintegration; for smooth solutions, standard $n_q = N+1$ Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre quadrature is sufficient to avoid aliasing in both reaction and advection.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The quadratic reaction term $R(u_h) = \\beta u_h^2$ leads to a cubic product of polynomials, $u_h^2 v_h$, with degree $3N$. The standard quadrature with $n_q=N+1$ is only exact up to degree $2(N+1)-3 = 2N-1$. Since $3N > 2N-1$ for all $N > -1$, and we know $N \\ge 0$, the standard quadrature is always insufficient for the reaction term.

The first part requires constructing a counterexample for the \"three-halves rule\" in a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) context. The second part requires deriving a general padding factor for de-aliasing in pseudo-spectral methods.\n\n### Part 1: Counterexample for the Three-Halves Rule\n\nThe problem asks for a counterexample to the sufficiency of the \"three-halves rule\" for numerical quadrature in a DG framework for a specific nonlinear problem.\n\nThe setting is a one-dimensional DG method on the reference element $[-1, 1]$. The approximation space for the solution $u$ and the test function $\\phi$ is the space of polynomials of degree at most $p$, denoted $\\mathbb{P}_{p}$. We are considering the volume integral contribution from a nonlinear flux $f(u) = u^3$. The integral to be computed is\n$$\nI = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(u(x)) \\phi(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-1}^{1} (u(x))^3 \\phi(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nwhere $u, \\phi \\in \\mathbb{P}_{p}$.\n\nThis integral is approximated using an $n$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule. Such a rule is known to be exact for any polynomial integrand of degree at most $2n-1$.\n\nThe \"three-halves rule\" specifies the number of quadrature points $n$ as a function of the polynomial degree $p$:\n$$\nn = \\left\\lceil \\frac{3}{2}(p+1) \\right\\rceil\n$$\nThe degree of exactness of the corresponding quadrature is therefore $D_{exact} = 2n-1 = 2 \\left\\lceil \\frac{3}{2}(p+1) \\right\\rceil - 1$.\n\nTo find a counterexample, we must find a polynomial degree $p \\ge 1$ and specific polynomials $u, \\phi \\in \\mathbb{P}_{p}$ such that the degree of the integrand, $\\deg((u(x))^3 \\phi(x))$, is greater than $D_{exact}$.\n\nThe degree of the integrand can be determined as follows:\nSince $u(x) \\in \\mathbb{P}_{p}$, its degree is at most $p$. Consequently, the degree of $(u(x))^3$ is at most $3p$.\nSince $\\phi(x) \\in \\mathbb{P}_{p}$, its degree is at most $p$.\nThe degree of the product $(u(x))^3 \\phi(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of the factors, so its maximum possible degree is $3p + p = 4p$.\n\nFor the quadrature rule to be exact for all possible choices of $u, \\phi \\in \\mathbb{P}_p$, we would need the degree of exactness to be at least the maximum possible degree of the integrand. That is, we would need $D_{exact} \\ge 4p$.\nThe rule fails if we can find a $p$ such that $4p > D_{exact}$. Let's test for small values of $p \\ge 1$.\n\n- For $p=1$:\n  - Maximum integrand degree is $4p = 4$.\n  - Number of quadrature points: $n = \\lceil \\frac{3}{2}(1+1) \\rceil = \\lceil 3 \\rceil = 3$.\n  - Degree of exactness: $D_{exact} = 2(3)-1 = 5$.\n  - Since $4 \\le 5$, the rule is sufficient. No counterexample exists for $p=1$.\n\n- For $p=2$:\n  - Maximum integrand degree is $4p = 8$.\n  - Number of quadrature points: $n = \\lceil \\frac{3}{2}(2+1) \\rceil = \\lceil 4.5 \\rceil = 5$.\n  - Degree of exactness: $D_{exact} = 2(5)-1 = 9$.\n  - Since $8 \\le 9$, the rule is sufficient. No counterexample exists for $p=2$.\n\n- For $p=3$:\n  - Maximum integrand degree is $4p = 12$.\n  - Number of quadrature points: $n = \\lceil \\frac{3}{2}(3+1) \\rceil = \\lceil 6 \\rceil = 6$.\n  - Degree of exactness: $D_{exact} = 2(6)-1 = 11$.\n  - Here we have $12 > 11$. This means that there may exist an integrand of degree $12$ that is not integrated exactly by the $6$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature. This provides the basis for our counterexample.\n\nWe now construct the explicit counterexample for $p=3$.\nLet the polynomial degree be $p=3$. The approximation space is $\\mathbb{P}_{3}$.\nChoose $u(x)$ and $\\phi(x)$ to maximize the degree of the integrand. Let $u(x) = x^3$ and $\\phi(x) = x^3$. Both polynomials are in $\\mathbb{P}_{3}$.\nThe integrand is:\n$$\n(u(x))^3 \\phi(x) = (x^3)^3 (x^3) = x^9 \\cdot x^3 = x^{12}\n$$\nThe degree of this integrand is $12$.\nFor $p=3$, the three-halves rule prescribes $n = 6$ quadrature points. A $6$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule is exact for polynomials of degree up to $2n-1 = 11$.\nSince the degree of our integrand ($12$) is greater than the degree of exactness of the quadrature rule ($11$), the numerical integration will not yield the exact value of the integral in general. The error formula for Gauss-Legendre quadrature confirms that for a function whose $(2n)$-th derivative is non-zero, the error is non-zero. For the integrand $g(x) = x^{12}$ and $n=6$, the $2n=12$-th derivative is $g^{(12)}(x) = 12!$, which is a non-zero constant. Thus, the quadrature approximation is not exact.\n\nThis explicitly demonstrates that for $p=3$, the \"three-halves rule\" fails to control aliasing for the cubic nonlinearity $f(u)=u^3$, as it leads to a quadrature rule that cannot exactly integrate all possible integrands arising from the weak form.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Padding Factor\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal padding factor $\\alpha_m$ required to eliminate aliasing errors when computing an $m$-linear product in a pseudo-spectral method.\n\nThe setting is a one-dimensional periodic domain. We consider $m$ functions, $u_1, \\dots, u_m$, which are bandlimited. Their Fourier spectra $\\hat{u}_j(k)$ are non-zero only for wavenumbers $k$ within the interval $[-K, K]$, for some maximum resolved wavenumber $K$. We want to compute the product $v(x) = u_1(x) \\cdots u_m(x)$.\n\nFrom the convolution theorem, the Fourier transform of the product of functions is the convolution of their individual Fourier transforms. For the exact product $v$, its spectrum $\\hat{v}(k)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{v} = \\hat{u}_1 * \\hat{u}_2 * \\dots * \\hat{u}_m\n$$\nwhere $*$ denotes continuous convolution. The support of a convolution is the Minkowski sum of the supports of the functions being convolved. Since each $\\hat{u}_j$ is supported on $[-K, K]$, the support of $\\hat{v}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{supp}(\\hat{v}) = [-K, K] + [-K, K] + \\dots + [-K, K] \\quad (m \\text{ times}) = [-mK, mK]\n$$\nThus, the exact product $v(x)$ is a bandlimited function with maximum wavenumber $mK$.\n\nIn a pseudo-spectral method, the product is computed by pointwise multiplication on a discrete grid in physical space. If this grid has $P$ points, this operation corresponds to a circular convolution of the discrete Fourier spectra. The resulting discrete Fourier coefficients of the product, denoted $\\hat{v}_k^{\\text{DFT}}$, are related to the true continuous Fourier series coefficients $\\hat{v}_k$ by the aliasing formula:\n$$\n\\hat{v}_k^{\\text{DFT}} = \\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{v}_{k+jP}\n$$\nThe goal is to choose the padded grid size $P$ such that the computed coefficients are exact for the target wavenumbers, i.e., $\\hat{v}_k^{\\text{DFT}} = \\hat{v}_k$ for all $k \\in [-K, K]$. This requires that all other terms in the aliasing sum vanish for the target range of $k$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\neq 0} \\hat{v}_{k+jP} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in [-K, K]\n$$\nSince $\\hat{v}$ is supported on $[-mK, mK]$, this condition is met if the aliased wavenumbers $k+jP$ (for $j \\neq 0$) fall outside this support interval for any $k \\in [-K, K]$.\n\nLet's analyze the condition for $j=1$ and $j=-1$, as these provide the tightest constraints.\nFor $j=1$: We need $k+P$ to be outside $[-mK, mK]$ for all $k \\in [-K, K]$. The smallest value of $k+P$ is $-K+P$. To ensure this falls outside the support on the positive side, we need:\n$$\n-K+P > mK \\implies P > (m+1)K\n$$\nFor $j=-1$: We need $k-P$ to be outside $[-mK, mK]$ for all $k \\in [-K, K]$. The largest value of $k-P$ is $K-P$. To ensure this falls outside the support on the negative side, we need:\n$$\nK-P  -mK \\implies P > (m+1)K\n$$\nFor $|j| \\geq 2$, the constraints on $P$ are weaker (e.g., for $j=2$, we need $P > \\frac{1}{2}(m+1)K$). Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition on the padded grid size $P$ to prevent aliasing into the modes $|k| \\le K$ is $P > (m+1)K$.\n\nThe problem defines a padding factor $\\alpha_m$ such that $P = \\alpha_m N$, where $N$ is the original grid length. The problem also states that $K$ is related to $N$ \"in the usual way\". In spectral methods, an $N$-point grid is used to represent a function that is bandlimited up to a maximum wavenumber $K$. For a real-valued function on a grid with an even number of points $N$, the highest resolvable wavenumber is the Nyquist wavenumber, $K=N/2$. This relation provides a direct link between $K$ and $N$.\n\nSubstituting $P = \\alpha_m N$ and the relation $K = N/2$ into the derived condition $P > (m+1)K$:\n$$\n\\alpha_m N > (m+1) \\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)\n$$\nDividing by $N$ (which is positive) yields:\n$$\n\\alpha_m > \\frac{m+1}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal padding factor $\\alpha_m$ that satisfies this condition. This corresponds to the lower bound of the inequality.\n$$\n\\alpha_m = \\frac{m+1}{2}\n$$\nThis result is a closed-form analytic expression in $m$. For the quadratic case ($m=2$), $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{3}{2}$, which is the well-known \"3/2-rule\". For the cubic case ($m=3$), $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$, which is the \"2x-rule\".", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{m+1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3423358"}]}
