The approximation $u_h$ is a polynomial on each element $K_j = [x_{j-1/2}, x_{j+1/2}]$ but is allowed to be discontinuous across element interfaces $x_{j+1/2}$. The semi-discrete weak formulation on an element $K_j$ is obtained by multiplying the PDE by a test function $v$ from the same polynomial space and integrating over $K_j$.

These errors break the delicate cancellation that leads to energy conservation in the continuous case. The discrete volume integral for the convective term does not sum to zero and can be positive. While a central flux for the convective term is non-dissipative (energy-preserving), it cannot compensate for the energy production from the under-integrated volume term.

By reformulating the convective term into a form that is discretely skew-symmetric (using SBP operators), the volume integrals' contribution to energy growth is eliminated by construction.\n    $3$. \"employing ... overintegration can remove this growth mechanism\": Overintegration refers to using a quadrature rule of sufficiently high degree to integrate the nonlinear term exactly. For the weak form using $v_h = u_h$, the integrand is of degree up to $3N-1$. If a quadrature rule exact for this degree is used, the aliasing error is eliminated. The discrete integral then equals the exact integral, and with a non-dissipative flux like the central flux, the discrete operator mimics the continuous operator's energy neutrality.

The Lax-Friedrichs (or Rusanov) numerical flux is a classic example of a *dissipative* flux. It is constructed by adding a numerical dissipation term to a less dissipative flux (like the central flux). The purpose of this dissipation is to remove energy from unresolved, high-frequency modes, thereby stabilizing the computation. The contribution of this numerical dissipation term to the energy equation is provably non-positive.
