The coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ are functions of position but are treated as constants for local classification.\n\nThe most general form of the principal part of a linear second-order operator in two variables is:\n$$L[u] = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{2} M_{ij} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = M_{11}u_{x_1 x_1} + M_{12}u_{x_1 x_2} + M_{21}u_{x_2 x_1} + M_{22}u_{x_2 x_2}$$\nThe function $u$ is stated to be \"sufficiently smooth\", which implies that the mixed partial derivatives are equal by Schwarz's theorem on the symmetry of second derivatives, i.e., $u_{x_1 x_2} = u_{x_2 x_1}$ (or $u_{xy} = u_{yx}$). Applying this theorem allows us to combine the mixed derivative terms:\n$$L[u] = M_{11}u_{x_1 x_1} + (M_{12} + M_{21})u_{x_1 x_2} + M_{22}u_{x_2 x_2}$$\nTo match this general expression with the given operator $A\\,u_{xx} + B\\,u_{xy} + C\\,u_{yy}$, we can identify the coefficients:\n$M_{11} = A$\n$M_{12} + M_{21} = B$\n$M_{22} = C$\n\nThis system of equations does not uniquely determine the coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{M} = (M_{ij})$, as there is one degree of freedom in choosing $M_{12}$ and $M_{21}$. For example, one could choose $M_{12} = B$ and $M_{21} = 0$, or $M_{12} = 0$ and $M_{21} = B$.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that classification is based on the principal symbol, which is a quadratic form defined by a symmetric coefficient matrix. Let this symmetric matrix be $\\mathbf{A}_{sym} = (a_{ij})$, where $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. This yields a unique representation. For this symmetric matrix to represent the same operator, its coefficients must satisfy the same relations:\n$a_{11} = A$\n$a_{12} + a_{21} = B$\n$a_{22} = C$\nImposing the symmetry condition $a_{12} = a_{21}$ on the second equation gives $2a_{12} = B$, which implies $a_{12} = \\frac{B}{2}$.\nThus, the unique symmetric coefficient matrix corresponding to the operator is:\n$$\\mathbf{A}_{sym} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} A & \\frac{B}{2} \\\\ \\frac{B}{2} & C \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe problem introduces the standard symmetric convention for the operator as $A\\,u_{xx} + 2\\,\\widetilde{B}\\,u_{xy} + C\\,u_{yy}$. By comparing the coefficient of the mixed partial derivative $u_{xy}$ in this convention with that in our original form ($B$), we find the identity:\n$$2\\,\\widetilde{B} = B \\implies \\widetilde{B} = \\frac{B}{2}$$\nThis identifies the coefficient $\\widetilde{B}$ in the standard symmetric form. We see that $\\widetilde{B}$ is precisely the off-diagonal entry, $a_{12}$, of the symmetric coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{sym}$.\n\nThe justification for the factor of $2$ in the standard convention $2\\,\\widetilde{B}\\,u_{xy}$ comes from the definition of the principal symbol and its associated quadratic form. The principal symbol is obtained by replacing the differential operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ with a Fourier variable $\\xi_i$. For the operator $L[u]$, the corresponding quadratic form is:\n$$q(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = A\\,\\xi_1^2 + B\\,\\xi_1\\xi_2 + C\\,\\xi_2^2$$\nAny such quadratic form can be written as $\\mathbf{\\xi}^T \\mathbf{A}_{sym} \\mathbf{\\xi}$, where $\\mathbf{\\xi} = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2)^T$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{sym}$ is the unique symmetric matrix derived above. Let us verify this:\n$$\\mathbf{\\xi}^T \\mathbf{A}_{sym} \\mathbf{\\xi} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_1 & \\xi_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A & \\frac{B}{2} \\\\ \\frac{B}{2} & C \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_1 \\\\ \\xi_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_1 & \\xi_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A\\xi_1 + \\frac{B}{2}\\xi_2 \\\\ \\frac{B}{2}\\xi_1 + C\\xi_2 \\end{pmatrix} = A\\xi_1^2 + \\frac{B}{2}\\xi_1\\xi_2 + \\frac{B}{2}\\xi_2\\xi_1 + C\\xi_2^2 = A\\xi_1^2 + B\\xi_1\\xi_2 + C\\xi_2^2$$\nThis matches the quadratic form derived directly from the non-symmetric operator. The problem defines the standard quadratic form as $q(\\xi,\\eta)=a_{11}\\,\\xi^{2}+2\\,a_{12}\\,\\xi\\,\\eta+a_{22}\\,\\eta^{2}$. The factor of $2$ is a convention that ensures the coefficient $a_{12}$ is exactly the off-diagonal entry of the symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{sym}$ ($\\widetilde{B}$ in the problem's notation), rather than half of it. This convention directly links the operator's written form to the matrix entries used for classification and in numerical weak forms. The weak bilinear form used in spectral and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, after integration by parts, naturally involves the symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{sym}$ as $a(u,v) = \\int (\\nabla v)^T \\mathbf{A}_{sym} (\\nabla u)\\,d\\mathbf{x}$ (ignoring boundary terms and overall sign), which is why this symmetric formulation is fundamental.\n\nHaving established the relationship $\\widetilde{B} = \\frac{B}{2}$, we can now address the second part of the problem. We are asked to express the standard discriminant, $\\Delta=\\widetilde{B}^{2}-A\\,C$, in terms of the original coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\widetilde{B}$ into the formula for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{B}{2}\\right)^2 - A\\,C$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{B^2}{4} - A\\,C$$\nThis is the discriminant for the PDE classification based on the symmetric formulation, expressed entirely in terms of the coefficients from the initial non-symmetric representation. The sign of $\\Delta$ determines the type of the equation: hyperbolic if $\\Delta > 0$, parabolic if $\\Delta = 0$, and elliptic if $\\Delta < 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{B^{2}}{4} - A\\,C}$$", "id": "3371090"}, {"introduction": "Classification is far more than an abstract labeling exercise; it has profound consequences for the well-posedness and stability of boundary value problems.

Part A concerns the classification of the operator, and Part B requires the derivation of a constant in an a priori estimate for a related boundary value problem.\n\n**Part A: Classification of the Operator**\n\nThe given linear second-order operator is $L u = -\\nabla \\cdot \\big( A(x,y)\\,\\nabla u \\big)$, where the coefficient matrix is $A(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & x \\end{pmatrix}$. The domain is $\\Omega = (0,1)\\times(0,1)$.\n\nThe classification of such an operator depends on its principal symbol. For a general divergence-form operator $L u = -\\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\partial_{x_i} (a_{ij}(x) \\partial_{x_j} u)$, the principal symbol at a point $x$ is the quadratic form $p(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}(x) \\xi_i \\xi_j$, where $\\xi = (\\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is a frequency vector. In our two-dimensional case, with $x = (x,y)$ and $\\xi = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$, the principal symbol is given by the quadratic form associated with the matrix $A(x,y)$:\n$$\np(x,y,\\xi) = \\xi^T A(x,y) \\xi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_1 & \\xi_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & x \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_1 \\\\ \\xi_2 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot \\xi_1^2 + x \\cdot \\xi_2^2.\n$$\n\nAn operator is defined as elliptic at a point if its principal symbol is positive definite at that point. This means $p(x,y,\\xi) > 0$ for all $\\xi \\neq 0$. Let's examine this condition for any point $(x,y) \\in \\Omega$. In $\\Omega = (0,1)\\times(0,1)$, we have $x \\in (0,1)$ and thus $x > 0$. For any non-zero vector $\\xi = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$, at least one of its components is non-zero.\n- If $\\xi_1 \\neq 0$, then $\\xi_1^2 > 0$, so $p(x,y,\\xi) = \\xi_1^2 + x \\xi_2^2 \\ge \\xi_1^2 > 0$.\n- If $\\xi_1 = 0$, then it must be that $\\xi_2 \\neq 0$. In this case, $\\xi_2^2 > 0$. Since $x > 0$, we have $p(x,y,\\xi) = x \\xi_2^2 > 0$.\nIn all cases, for any $(x,y) \\in \\Omega$ and any $\\xi \\neq 0$, the principal symbol is strictly positive. Therefore, the operator $L$ is elliptic at every point of $\\Omega$.\n\nAn operator is uniformly elliptic on $\\Omega$ if there exists a constant $\\alpha_0 > 0$ such that the principal symbol is uniformly bounded below, i.e., $p(x,y,\\xi) \\ge \\alpha_0 |\\xi|^2$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\Omega$ and all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, where $|\\xi|^2 = \\xi_1^2 + \\xi_2^2$. This condition is equivalent to the smallest eigenvalue of the coefficient matrix $A(x,y)$ being uniformly bounded below by a positive constant $\\alpha_0$ across the entire domain $\\Omega$.\n\nThe matrix $A(x,y)$ is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = x$. The smallest eigenvalue at a point $(x,y) \\in \\Omega$ is $\\lambda_{\\min}(x,y) = \\min(1, x)$. For uniform ellipticity, we require $\\inf_{(x,y) \\in \\Omega} \\lambda_{\\min}(x,y) \\ge \\alpha_0 > 0$.\nLet's compute this infimum over the domain $\\Omega = (0,1)\\times(0,1)$:\n$$\n\\inf_{(x,y) \\in (0,1)\\times(0,1)} \\lambda_{\\min}(x,y) = \\inf_{x \\in (0,1)} \\min(1, x).\n$$\nSince $x \\in (0,1)$, we have $x < 1$, so $\\min(1, x) = x$. The infimum becomes:\n$$\n\\inf_{x \\in (0,1)} x = 0.\n$$\nSince the infimum of the smallest eigenvalue is $0$, there exists no positive constant $\\alpha_0$ that can act as a uniform lower bound. The ellipticity degenerates as $x$ approaches $0$. Consequently, the operator $L$ is not uniformly elliptic on $\\Omega$.\n\n**Part B: A Priori Estimate**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the smallest admissible constant $C(\\varepsilon)$ in the a priori estimate $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})} \\leq C(\\varepsilon)\\, \\|f\\|_{H^{-1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}$. The weak problem is posed on the Hilbert space $V = H_0^1(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})$ equipped with the norm $\\|v\\|_V = \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}$. The problem is to find $u \\in V$ such that $a_{\\varepsilon}(u,v) = \\langle f,v \\rangle$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\nThe Lax-Milgram theorem guarantees a unique solution and provides an estimate. From the weak formulation, we have $a_{\\varepsilon}(u,u) = \\langle f, u \\rangle$.\nThe definition of the dual norm $\\|f\\|_{H^{-1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}$ implies $|\\langle f, u \\rangle| \\le \\|f\\|_{H^{-1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})} \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}$.\nThe coercivity of the bilinear form states that there exists a constant $\\alpha > 0$ such that $a_{\\varepsilon}(v,v) \\ge \\alpha \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}^2$ for all $v \\in H_0^1(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})$.\nCombining these, we get:\n$$\n\\alpha \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}^2 \\le a_{\\varepsilon}(u,u) = \\langle f, u \\rangle \\le \\|f\\|_{H^{-1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})} \\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}.\n$$\nAssuming $u \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}$ to obtain the estimate:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})} \\le \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\|f\\|_{H^{-1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}.\n$$\nTo find the smallest admissible constant $C(\\varepsilon)$, we must use the largest possible coercivity constant, $\\alpha_{\\max}$. The smallest constant is then $C(\\varepsilon) = 1/\\alpha_{\\max}$. The value of $\\alpha_{\\max}$ is determined by the infimum of the Rayleigh quotient for the bilinear form:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\max} = \\inf_{v \\in H_0^1(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}), v \\neq 0} \\frac{a_{\\varepsilon}(v,v)}{\\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}^2}.\n$$\nLet's analyze this ratio using the definitions of the bilinear form and the norm:\n$$\na_{\\varepsilon}(v,v) = \\int_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}} \\left( (\\partial_x v)^2 + x (\\partial_y v)^2 \\right) dx\\,dy,\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}^2 = \\int_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}} \\left( (\\partial_x v)^2 + (\\partial_y v)^2 \\right) dx\\,dy.\n$$\nFor the coercivity inequality $a_{\\varepsilon}(v,v) \\ge \\alpha \\|\\nabla v\\|_{L^2(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon})}^2$ to hold for all $v$, it is sufficient that the inequality holds pointwise for the integrands for any potential gradient values. Let $g_1 = \\partial_x v$ and $g_2 = \\partial_y v$. We require:\n$$\ng_1^2 + x g_2^2 \\ge \\alpha (g_1^2 + g_2^2)\n$$\nfor all $(x,y) \\in \\Omega_{\\varepsilon} = (\\varepsilon, 1) \\times (0,1)$ and all $g_1, g_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Rearranging the terms gives:\n$$\n(1-\\alpha)g_1^2 + (x-\\alpha)g_2^2 \\ge 0.\n$$\nFor this quadratic form in $g_1, g_2$ to be non-negative for all choices of $g_1, g_2$, the coefficients must be non-negative. This must hold for all $x$ in the domain $(\\varepsilon, 1)$.\n1.  $1 - \\alpha \\ge 0 \\implies \\alpha \\le 1$.\n2.  $x - \\alpha \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in (\\varepsilon, 1) \\implies \\alpha \\le x$ for all $x \\in (\\varepsilon, 1)$.\n\nThe second condition implies that $\\alpha$ must be less than or equal to the infimum of $x$ over its domain, which is $\\inf_{x \\in (\\varepsilon,1)} x = \\varepsilon$.\nSo, we have two constraints: $\\alpha \\le 1$ and $\\alpha \\le \\varepsilon$. Since the problem states $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$, the second constraint $\\alpha \\le \\varepsilon$ is the more restrictive one.\nThe largest possible value of $\\alpha$ that satisfies both conditions is $\\alpha = \\varepsilon$. This gives an upper bound for the coercivity constant: $\\alpha_{\\max} \\le \\varepsilon$.\n\nWe must also show that this value is attainable. The infimum of the Rayleigh quotient is indeed $\\varepsilon$. This can be demonstrated by constructing a sequence of functions for which the quotient approaches $\\varepsilon$. Consider functions that vary predominantly in the $y$-direction and are spatially localized near $x=\\varepsilon$. For such functions, the term $(\\partial_y v)^2$ dominates $(\\partial_x v)^2$, and the factor $x$ in the numerator $a_\\varepsilon(v,v)$ is close to $\\varepsilon$. This confirms that the greatest lower bound, and thus the largest coercivity constant, is $\\alpha_{\\max} = \\varepsilon$.\n\nThe smallest admissible constant $C(\\varepsilon)$ for the a priori estimate is therefore:\n$$\nC(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nThis constant quantifies the stability of the problem. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the operator's ellipticity degenerates, the problem becomes increasingly ill-conditioned, and the constant $C(\\varepsilon)$ blows up, reflecting a loss of stability.

The integrand $V^2$ has degree up to $2(m+N-1) = 2m+2N-2$.\n-   **Question:** The problem asks if, due to the quadrature being inexact for $m \\ge 1$ (since $2m+2N-2 > 2N-1$) and the associated aliasing, the spectral method can misclassify the degenerate parabolic operator as elliptic. An elliptic classification would correspond to the discrete quadratic form being strictly positive definite.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem is firmly established in the theory of numerical analysis for PDEs, specifically spectral methods. All concepts—operator classification, discriminant, quadratic forms, collocation, LGL quadrature, pseudospectral methods, and aliasing—are standard and correctly defined.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The question is conceptual (\"can...\") and has a definite answer based on the analysis of the discrete system's properties.\n-   **Objectivity:** The formulation is purely technical, using precise mathematical language.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary definitions to analyze the situation. The setup is internally consistent.\n-   **Realism and Feasibility:** The scenario described is a classic and practical issue in the implementation of spectral methods for variable-coefficient problems.\n-   **Triviality:** The question is non-trivial; it requires a detailed understanding of how numerical discretization, particularly aliasing, affects the spectral properties of an operator.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe analytical operator is degenerate parabolic, characterized by the semidefiniteness of the quadratic form $Q(u) = \\int_{\\Omega} (p\\,u_x + q\\,u_y)^2\\,dx\\,dy \\ge 0$. The form is zero for any function $u$ in the kernel of the directional derivative operator $L_d = p\\,\\partial_x + q\\,\\partial_y$.\n\nThe numerical analysis is performed within the finite-dimensional polynomial space $\\mathcal{P}_N$. The discrete quadratic form is given by the application of LGL quadrature to the integrand evaluated at the collocation nodes $\\{\\vec{x}_j\\}$ with weights $\\{w_j\\}$:\n$$Q_h(u_N) = \\sum_j w_j \\left[ (p\\,u_{N,x} + q\\,u_{N,y})(\\vec{x}_j) \\right]^2$$\nfor $u_N \\in \\mathcal{P}_N$. Since the weights $w_j$ are positive, $Q_h(u_N) \\ge 0$. The discrete form is strictly positive definite (implying an elliptic classification) if $Q_h(u_N) = 0$ only for $u_N = \\text{const}$. This requires the expression $(p\\,u_{N,x} + q\\,u_{N,y})(\\vec{x}_j)$ to be zero at all collocation nodes $\\vec{x}_j$ only if $u_N$ is a constant.\n\nLet's analyze the cases based on the coefficient degree $m$.\n\n**Case 1: Constant Coefficients ($m=0$)**\nHere, $p$ and $q$ are constants. The term $V = p\\,u_{N,x} + q\\,u_{N,y}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $N-1$. The integrand $V^2$ is a polynomial of degree at most $2(N-1)$. Since $2(N-1) < 2N-1$ (for $N \\ge 1$), the LGL quadrature rule is exact.\n$$Q_h(u_N) = \\int_{\\Omega} (p\\,u_{N,x} + q\\,u_{N,y})^2\\,dx\\,dy$$\nThe discrete form is zero if we can find a non-constant $u_N \\in \\mathcal{P}_N$ such that $p\\,u_{N,x} + q\\,u_{N,y} \\equiv 0$. The general solution to this first-order PDE is $u(x,y)=f(qy-px)$. We can easily choose a function $f$ such that $u_N$ is a non-trivial polynomial in $\\mathcal{P}_N$, for example $u_N(x,y) = (qy-px)^k$ for $1 \\le k \\le N$. For such a $u_N$, $Q_h(u_N) = 0$. Thus, the discrete quadratic form remains semidefinite, and the parabolic degeneracy is correctly preserved.\n\n**Case 2: Variable Coefficients ($m \\ge 1$)**\nThe degree of the integrand is $2m+2N-2$. Since $m \\ge 1$, $2m+2N-2 \\ge 2N$, which exceeds the degree of exactness $2N-1$ of the LGL quadrature. The quadrature is inexact. This inexactness is a manifestation of aliasing in the pseudospectral context.\nThe discrete quadratic form $Q_h(u_N)$ is zero if and only if the polynomial $V = p\\,u_{N,x} + q\\,u_{N,y}$ evaluates to zero at all collocation points $\\vec{x}_j$.\nThe key question is whether this implies $u_N$ must be constant. Let's consider a simple example with $m=1$: let $p(x,y)=x$ and $q(x,y)=y$. The condition for a zero of the quadratic form becomes $(x\\,u_{N,x} + y\\,u_{N,y})(\\vec{x}_j)=0$ for all nodes $\\vec{x}_j$.\nThe polynomial $V = x\\,u_{N,x} + y\\,u_{N,y}$ has degree at most $N$. A polynomial in $\\mathcal{P}_N$ that is zero at all $(N+1)^2$ LGL nodes must be identically zero. Therefore, we require $x\\,u_{N,x} + y\\,u_{N,y} \\equiv 0$. If $u_N = \\sum_{i+j \\le N} c_{ij}x^i y^j$, this condition becomes $\\sum (i+j)c_{ij}x^i y^j \\equiv 0$, which implies $(i+j)c_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j$. This forces $c_{ij}=0$ for all $i+j \\ge 1$, meaning $u_N$ can only be a constant ($c_{00}$).\nIn this example, for any non-constant $u_N \\in \\mathcal{P}_N$, the polynomial $V$ is not identically zero, meaning $Q_h(u_N) > 0$. The discrete quadratic form is positive definite (on the space of non-constant functions). This corresponds to an elliptic classification.\nThe continuous operator was parabolic, but the discrete counterpart is elliptic. The misclassification has occurred. This is a direct result of how the variable coefficients and derivatives are combined and evaluated on the discrete grid, a process fundamentally linked to aliasing effects when the products create polynomials of a degree too high for the grid to represent or the quadrature to integrate exactly.\n\nNow we evaluate the options based on this analysis.\n\n**A. For constant coefficients $m=0,$ the collocation spectral method with Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto quadrature preserves the parabolic degeneracy: there exist nontrivial polynomial $u_N$ with $p\\,u_x + q\\,u_y \\equiv 0,$ and the discrete quadratic form remains semidefinite; however, for variable coefficients $m\\ge 1,$ aliasing of $p\\,u_x$ and $q\\,u_y$ and inexact quadrature can eliminate the discrete kernel and yield a strictly positive discrete principal form, leading to an apparent elliptic classification.**\nThis statement is a perfect summary of our analysis. The $m=0$ case is handled correctly, preserving the semidefinite nature. The $m \\ge 1$ case can, as demonstrated, lead to a positive definite discrete form due to the effects of handling variable-coefficient products on a grid, which is described as \"aliasing and inexact quadrature\". The term \"eliminate the discrete kernel\" precisely describes what happened in our $p=x, q=y$ example, where the only function left in the kernel was the constant function.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Aliasing cannot affect type in a collocation spectral method because the discriminant $$\\Delta=b^2-ac$$ is known to be identically zero analytically, so the numerical procedure necessarily preserves parabolicity regardless of quadrature.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. It wrongly assumes that a pointwise analytical property of a continuous operator must be inherited by its discrete approximation. Numerical methods can and often do fail to preserve such properties, and aliasing is a well-known source of such discrepancies. Our analysis of case $m \\ge 1$ provides a direct counterexample.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Misclassification of a degenerate parabolic operator as elliptic due to quadrature exactness or aliasing is exclusive to the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and cannot happen in a collocation spectral method.**\nThis statement is false. The mechanism for misclassification that we have just analyzed occurs squarely within a collocation spectral method. While similar issues can arise in DG methods, the problem is not exclusive to them. Pseudospectral collocation methods are particularly susceptible to aliasing errors from nonlinear or variable-coefficient terms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Overintegration (choosing a quadrature exact for degrees up to $$2m+2N-2$$ or using the three-halves de-aliasing rule) and coefficient pre-projection (projecting $$p$$ and $$q$$ into a lower-degree space so that $$p\\,u_x$$ and $$q\\,u_y$$ are exactly representable) are effective remedies that restore a semidefinite discrete principal form and preserve the correct parabolic classification.**\nThis statement proposes standard techniques to combat aliasing.\n-   **Overintegration:** Using a quadrature rule exact for the degree of the true integrand, $2m+2N-2$, would compute $Q(u_N) = \\int_{\\Omega} (p u_{N,x} + q u_{N,y})^2 dx dy$ exactly. This removes the error from inexact quadrature. If the problem was that aliasing/inexact quadrature destabilized a truly semidefinite discrete system, this would fix it. It restores the properties of the continuous operator restricted to $\\mathcal{P}_N$. In a context where aliasing is seen as the culprit that removes a kernel, overintegration is the direct remedy to prevent that removal.\n-   **Coefficient Pre-projection:** Projecting the coefficients $p,q$ onto a lower-degree polynomial space (e.g., constants, $k=0$) changes the operator to one that is known to be well-behaved by the discretization (as shown in the $m=0$ case). This is a common practical remedy.\nThese methods are precisely the standard \"de-aliasing\" strategies used to ensure the discrete system better reflects the continuous one. If aliasing causes the spurious elliptic classification as per statement A, then these de-aliasing techniques are the correct remedies to restore the intended semidefinite (parabolic) nature.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3371120"}]}
