The imposed hydraulic gradient is uniform so that, by Darcy’s law, each layer supports a layer-specific Darcy velocity proportional to its hydraulic conductivity. Let the arithmetic mean pore velocity across the stack be given and denoted by $\\bar{v}$. Assume the porosity $n$ is constant and identical in all layers and that local (pore-scale) dispersion and molecular diffusion are negligible compared to the macrodispersion generated by velocity contrasts and interfacial mixing.\n\nUsing a simple mixing-length model, define the longitudinal macrodispersion coefficient $D_{\\mathrm{macro}}$ via the Lagrangian velocity autocorrelation function $C_v(\\tau) = \\langle v'(t) v'(t+\\tau)\\rangle$, where $v'(t)$ is the fluctuation of the Lagrangian solute velocity about its mean $\\bar{v}$.

For an infinite stack of such layers, a solute particle will, on average, spend equal time in layers of type $1$ and type $2$.
