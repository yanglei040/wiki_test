This first exercise guides you through the derivation of these fundamental parameters from first principles, building intuition by analyzing idealized physical experiments.

Let the drained bulk modulus of the porous skeleton be $K_d$, the bulk modulus of the solid grains be $K_s$, the bulk modulus of the pore fluid be $K_f$, and the porosity be $n$. Work from fundamental definitions of moduli, mass conservation, and thermodynamic consistency:\n\n- The drained bulk modulus $K_d$ is defined from a drained hydrostatic test in which pore pressure is held constant, as the ratio of an increment in mean total stress to the corresponding increment in volumetric strain.\n- The solid grain bulk modulus $K_s$ is defined from an unjacketed hydrostatic test in which equal increments of confining pressure and pore pressure are applied, so the effective stress is unchanged and the specimen strains as a solid phase.\n- The pore fluid bulk modulus $K_f$ is defined from isothermal fluid compressibility, relating fluid density change to pore pressure change.\n- The porosity $n$ is the ratio of pore volume to bulk volume.\n- The Biot effective stress coefficient $\\alpha$ maps pore pressure into effective mean stress in the linear poroelastic constitutive law for volumetric response.\n- The Biot storage modulus $M$ maps pore pressure to fluid content change at fixed volumetric strain.\n\nStarting from these bases, first derive an expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of $K_d$ and $K_s$ by analyzing the unjacketed hydrostatic test. Next, using mass conservation of the pore fluid, the definitions of $K_s$ and $K_f$, and the requirement of thermodynamic reciprocity for linear poroelasticity, derive an expression for $M$ in terms of $\\alpha$, $n$, $K_s$, and $K_f$.

All parameters and concepts are standard in linear poroelasticity, and the numerical values are physically realistic.\n\nWe adopt a sign convention where compressive stresses and compressive strains (volume reduction) are positive.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Biot effective stress coefficient, $\\alpha$**\n\nThe linear poroelastic constitutive law relates the change in volumetric strain, $d\\varepsilon_v$, to the change in mean total stress, $d\\sigma$, and the change in pore pressure, $dp_f$. It is expressed in terms of the effective stress, $d\\sigma' = d\\sigma - \\alpha dp_f$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} d\\sigma' = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma - \\alpha dp_f) \\quad (*)$$\nIn an unjacketed hydrostatic test, the specimen is subjected to equal increments of confining pressure $dp_c$ and pore pressure $dp_f$. The mean total stress is equal to the confining pressure, so $d\\sigma = dp_c$. The test condition is therefore $d\\sigma = dp_f$.\n\nSubstituting this condition into the constitutive relation $(*)$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (dp_f - \\alpha dp_f) = \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{K_d} dp_f$$\nIn this test, the pressure surrounding the bulk material and the pressure within the pores are increased equally. This means the porous frame itself experiences no additional net stress, and the bulk volume change is solely due to the compression of the solid grains that constitute the matrix. The deformation is equivalent to that of a non-porous solid made of the grain material.\n\nThe volumetric strain of the solid grain material, $d\\varepsilon_s$, under a hydrostatic pressure change $dp_f$ is defined by the bulk modulus of the solid grains, $K_s$:\n$$d\\varepsilon_s = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nIn the unjacketed test, the bulk volumetric strain of the specimen $d\\varepsilon_v$ is equal to the volumetric strain of the grain material, $d\\varepsilon_s$. Thus:\n$$d\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nEquating the two expressions for $d\\varepsilon_v$:\n$$\\frac{1 - \\alpha}{K_d} dp_f = \\frac{1}{K_s} dp_f$$\nAssuming $dp_f \\neq 0$, we can cancel this term and solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$1 - \\alpha = \\frac{K_d}{K_s} \\implies \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s}$$\nThis is the required expression for the Biot effective stress coefficient.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Biot storage modulus, $M$**\n\nThe Biot storage modulus $M$ appears in the second constitutive equation, which relates the increment of fluid content, $d\\zeta$, to the changes in volumetric strain and pore pressure:\n$$d\\zeta = \\alpha d\\varepsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} dp_f$$\nTo derive an expression for $M$, we consider the physical origins of fluid storage. The increment of fluid content $d\\zeta$ is the volume of fluid injected into a unit bulk volume. This storage comes from two effects: the compression of the pore fluid already present, and the compression of the solid grains, which makes more space available.\nA detailed analysis based on mass conservation of the fluid and solid phases shows that the reciprocal of the Biot modulus can be expressed as:\n$$\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha - \\phi}{K_s}$$\nwhere the first term represents storage due to fluid compressibility and the second term represents storage due to grain compressibility relative to the bulk skeleton. This form is a direct consequence of the definition of $\\alpha$ and the requirement of thermodynamic consistency (i.e., that the constitutive equations can be derived from a single potential).\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\nGiven data: $K_d = 4$ GPa, $K_s = 36$ GPa, $K_f = 2$ GPa, and $n = 0.2$ (note: problem uses $n$, solution will use $\\phi=n$).\n\n-   **Calculate $\\alpha$**:\n    $$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} = 1 - \\frac{4}{36} = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$$\n    As a decimal, $\\alpha \\approx 0.88888...$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $\\alpha = 0.8889$.\n\n-   **Calculate $M$**:\n    We use the expression $\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\alpha - n}{K_s} + \\frac{n}{K_f}$.\n    First, find the values of the terms:\n    $$\\alpha - n = \\frac{8}{9} - 0.2 = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{40 - 9}{45} = \\frac{31}{45}$$\n    Now calculate the two terms for the reciprocal of $M$ (in units of GPa$^{-1}$):\n    $$\\frac{\\alpha - n}{K_s} = \\frac{31/45}{36} = \\frac{31}{1620}$$\n    $$\\frac{n}{K_f} = \\frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1$$\n    Sum the terms:\n    $$\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{31}{1620} + 0.1 = \\frac{31}{1620} + \\frac{162}{1620} = \\frac{193}{1620} \\text{ GPa}^{-1}$$\n    In decimal form, $1/M \\approx 0.0191358... + 0.1 = 0.1191358...$ GPa$^{-1}$.\n    Now, calculate $M$:\n    $$M = \\frac{1620}{193} \\text{ GPa} \\approx 8.39378... \\text{ GPa}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $M = 8.394$ GPa.\n\n**Part 4: Physical Implications**\n\n-   The value $\\alpha = 0.8889$ is close to $1$, which indicates that the pore fluid pressure is nearly as effective as the total mean stress in deforming the porous medium. This is characteristic of a material where the solid frame is much more compliant than the solid grains themselves ($K_d \\ll K_s$), which is true here ($4$ GPa $\\ll 36$ GPa).\n\n-   The storage modulus $M = 8.394$ GPa quantifies the pressure required to inject a certain volume of fluid into the rock while keeping the rock's bulk volume constant. The inverse, $1/M$, represents the specific storage capacity. The two components of $1/M$ are the storage due to grain compressibility ($\\frac{\\alpha-n}{K_s} \\approx 0.0191$ GPa$^{-1}$) and storage due to fluid compressibility ($\\frac{n}{K_f} = 0.1$ GPa$^{-1}$). In this case, the fluid compressibility term is about $5$ times larger than the grain compressibility term. This means that when fluid is forced into the rock at constant bulk volume, most of the storage effect comes from the compression of the fluid already in the pores, rather than from the compression of the solid grains to create more pore space.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.8889 & 8.394\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3503711"}, {"introduction": "A robust scientific theory should not exist in isolation; it must be consistent with other established models within its domain of applicability.

Numerical calculation of the modulus.\n\n**1. Derivation from Biot's Theory of Poroelasticity**\n\nIn the quasistatic, low-frequency limit, the constitutive relations for an isotropic, homogeneous poroelastic medium can be expressed in terms of the total mean stress $\\sigma_m$, the volumetric strain of the bulk material $\\epsilon_v$, the pore fluid pressure $p_f$, and the increment of fluid content $\\zeta$. Using a convention where compression is positive, these relations are:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (\\Delta\\sigma_m - \\alpha \\Delta p_f) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\zeta = \\alpha \\Delta\\epsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} \\Delta p_f $$\nHere, $K_d$ is the drained bulk modulus of the porous frame, $\\alpha$ is the Biot-Willis effective stress coefficient, and $M$ is the Biot modulus.\n\nAn undrained condition implies that there is no flow of the pore fluid in or out of a representative elementary volume. This corresponds to a constant fluid mass within the pores relative to the solid matrix, which means the increment of fluid content $\\Delta\\zeta$ is zero.\n$$ \\Delta\\zeta = 0 $$\nSubstituting this condition into the second constitutive equation gives a relationship between the pore pressure and the volumetric strain. However, for this derivation, it is more direct to use a thermodynamically consistent alternative form of the fluid content equation: $\\Delta p_f = M(\\alpha \\Delta\\epsilon_v - \\Delta\\zeta)$. For the undrained case ($\\Delta\\zeta = 0$):\n$$ \\Delta p_f = M \\alpha \\Delta\\epsilon_v $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\Delta p_f$ into the first constitutive equation for the strain:\n$$ \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (\\Delta\\sigma_m - \\alpha (M \\alpha \\Delta\\epsilon_v)) $$\n$$ K_d \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\Delta\\sigma_m - \\alpha^2 M \\Delta\\epsilon_v $$\n$$ (K_d + \\alpha^2 M) \\Delta\\epsilon_v = \\Delta\\sigma_m $$\nThe undrained bulk modulus, $K_u$, is defined as the ratio of the change in total mean stress to the change in volumetric strain under undrained conditions:\n$$ K_u \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma_m}{\\Delta\\epsilon_v} $$\nFrom this definition, we obtain the expression for the undrained bulk modulus in terms of the poroelastic parameters:\n$$ K_u = K_d + \\alpha^2 M $$\nTo express $K_u$ in terms of the given physical properties ($K_s$, $K_d$, $K_f$, $\\phi$), we must use the standard definitions for $\\alpha$ and $M$. These coefficients are derived from fundamental considerations of the compressibilities of the solid grains, the pore fluid, and the porous frame. They are given by:\n$$ \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha - \\phi}{K_s} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha$ into the equation for $1/M$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{(1 - K_d/K_s) - \\phi}{K_s} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1 - \\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{K_d}{K_s^2} $$\nFinally, substituting the expressions for $\\alpha$ and $M$ into the equation for $K_u$:\n$$ K_u = K_d + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{1/M} = K_d + \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s}\\right)^2}{\\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1 - \\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{K_d}{K_s^2}} $$\nThis equation gives the undrained bulk modulus $K_u$ entirely in terms of the specified rock and fluid properties.\n\n**2. The Gassmann Relation and Consistency Check**\n\nIndependently, for the same low-frequency quasistatic conditions, the bulk modulus of a fluid-saturated porous medium, $K_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, is described by the Gassmann relation. The formula is:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{sat}} = K_d + \\frac{\\left(1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s}\\right)^2}{\\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{1 - \\phi}{K_s} - \\frac{K_d}{K_s^2}} $$\nUpon inspection, this expression for $K_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ is formally identical to the expression for $K_u$ derived from Biot's theory. This confirms the consistency between the two formulations, as Gassmann's equation is the low-frequency limit of Biot's more general theory.
