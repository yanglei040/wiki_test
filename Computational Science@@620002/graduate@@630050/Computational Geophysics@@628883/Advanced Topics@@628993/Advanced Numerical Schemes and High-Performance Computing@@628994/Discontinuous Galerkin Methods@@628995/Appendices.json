Consider a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization on a one-dimensional mesh, and focus on the semi-discrete interface term at a single shared face between two adjacent elements.

It presents a standard exercise in the numerical analysis of hyperbolic partial differential equations, specifically concerning the derivation and application of an upwind numerical flux for the linear advection equation within the framework of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method.\n\nThe governing equation is the linear advection equation in one spatial dimension, written in conservation form as:\n$$\nu_{t} + (f(u))_{x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is a scalar quantity, and $f(u)$ is the physical flux function. For this problem, the flux is linear, given by $f(u) = a\\,u$, where $a$ is a constant advection speed. The equation can be written in its non-conservative (or advective) form as:\n$$\nu_{t} + a\\,u_{x} = 0\n$$\nThis is a first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation. The characteristic curves of this equation are given by the ordinary differential equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = a$. The solution $u$ is constant along these characteristic lines. This means that information propagates with speed $a$ in the direction determined by the sign of $a$.\n\nIn the Discontinuous Galerkin method, the solution is allowed to be discontinuous across element faces. At a given face, we have two values for the solution: $u^{-}$ representing the limit from the element on the left, and $u^{+}$ representing the limit from the element on the right. To compute the flux across this face, a numerical flux function, $\\hat{f}(u^{-}, u^{+})$, is used, which must be consistent with the physical flux (i.e., $\\hat{f}(u, u) = f(u)$).\n\nThe upwind numerical flux is derived by solving the local Riemann problem at the interface. The Riemann problem has the initial data:\n$$\nu(x, 0) = \n\\begin{cases} \nu^{-} & \\text{for } x < x_f \\\\\nu^{+} & \\text{for } x > x_f \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $x_f$ is the position of the face. The solution to this Riemann problem for the linear advection equation is a single wave (a contact discontinuity) propagating with speed $a$. The value of the solution at the interface location $x_f$ for any time $t > 0$, denoted $u(x_f, t)$, is determined by which side of the discontinuity the information is coming from. This is the \"upwind\" direction.\n\nThere are two cases based on the sign of the advection speed $a$:\n\nCase 1: $a > 0$.\nThe characteristics are directed from left to right. Information flows from the region where $x  x_f$ to the region where $x > x_f$. Therefore, the solution at the interface $x_f$ for $t > 0$ will be the value from the left, $u^{-}$. This is the upwind state. The upwind numerical flux, $\\hat{f}_{upwind}$, is the physical flux function $f(u) = a\\,u$ evaluated at this upwind state:\n$$\n\\hat{f}_{upwind}(u^{-}, u^{+}) = f(u^{-}) = a\\,u^{-}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $a  0$.\nThe characteristics are directed from right to left. Information flows from the region where $x > x_f$ to the region where $x  x_f$. The solution at the interface $x_f$ for $t > 0$ will be the value from the right, $u^{+}$. This is the upwind state. The upwind numerical flux is therefore:\n$$\n\\hat{f}_{upwind}(u^{-}, u^{+}) = f(u^{+}) = a\\,u^{+}\n$$\n\n(The case $a = 0$ is trivial; the flux is $f(u) = 0$ and there is no transport.)\n\nIn summary, the upwind numerical flux for the linear advection equation is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{f}_{upwind}(u^{-}, u^{+}) = \n\\begin{cases} \na\\,u^{-}  \\text{if } a > 0 \\\\\na\\,u^{+}  \\text{if } a  0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe are asked to compute this flux for the specific values:\n- Left state: $u^{-} = 2$\n- Right state: $u^{+} = -1$\n- Advection speed: $a = 3$\n\nSince the advection speed is $a = 3$, which is greater than $0$, we must use the first case of the derived formula. Information flows from left to right, so the upwind state is $u^{-}$. The numerical flux is:\n$$\n\\hat{f}_{upwind} = a\\,u^{-}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\hat{f}_{upwind} = (3) \\cdot (2) = 6\n$$\nThe resulting upwind numerical flux at the face is $6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$", "id": "3584949"}, {"introduction": "While numerical fluxes handle interactions between elements, the solution's behavior within each element is determined by its projection onto a basis of local polynomials.
