A careful expansion for small $\\theta$ yields:\n$$\\arg(G_{\\mathrm{LW}}) = -\\nu\\,\\theta + \\frac{\\nu(1-\\nu^2)}{6}\\theta^{3} + \\mathcal{O}(\\theta^{5}).$$\nSince $G = \\exp(-i\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{num}}\\,\\Delta t)$, we have $\\omega_{\\mathrm{num}}\\,\\Delta t = -\\arg(G)$, hence\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{num}}\\,\\Delta t}{\\theta} = \\nu - \\frac{\\nu\\,(1 - \\nu^{2})}{6}\\,\\theta^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\theta^{4}).$$\nMultiplying by $(\\Delta x/\\Delta t) = a/\\nu$ yields\n$$\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{num,LW}}(k)}{a} = 1 - \\frac{1 - \\nu^{2}}{6}\\,\\theta^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\theta^{4}).$$\nTherefore, the Lax–Wendroff phase error coefficient is\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{LW}}(\\nu) = -\\frac{1 - \\nu^{2}}{6} = \\frac{\\nu^{2}-1}{6}.$$\n\nFor the Beam–Warming scheme with $a>0$, substituting the same Fourier ansatz gives\n$$G_{\\mathrm{BW}}(\\theta) = 1 - \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\left(3 - 4\\,e^{-i\\theta} + e^{-2i\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{\\nu^{2}}{2}\\left(1 - 2\\,e^{-i\\theta} + e^{-2i\\theta}\\right).$$\nUsing $e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta - i\\,\\sin\\theta$ and $e^{-2i\\theta} = \\cos(2\\theta) - i\\,\\sin(2\\theta)$, we expand for small $\\theta$:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{BW}}(\\theta) = 1 - i\\,\\nu\\,\\theta - \\frac{\\nu^{2}}{2}\\,\\theta^{2} + i\\left(-\\frac{\\nu}{3} + \\frac{\\nu^{2}}{2}\\right)\\theta^{3} + \\mathcal{O}(\\theta^{4}).$$\nA similar expansion of the complex logarithm's imaginary part gives the argument:\n$$\\arg(G_{\\mathrm{BW}}) = -\\nu\\,\\theta + \\left(-\\frac{\\nu}{3} + \\frac{\\nu^2}{2} - \\frac{\\nu^3}{6}\\right)\\theta^{3} + \\mathcal{O}(\\theta^{5}).$$\nTherefore,\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{num}}\\,\\Delta t}{\\theta} = \\nu + \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{3} - \\frac{\\nu^{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\nu^{3}}{6}\\right)\\theta^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\theta^{4}),$$\nand hence\n$$\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{num,BW}}(k)}{a} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{\\nu}{2} + \\frac{\\nu^{2}}{6}\\right)\\theta^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\theta^{4}).$$\nThus, the Beam–Warming phase error coefficient is\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{BW}}(\\nu) = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{\\nu}{2} + \\frac{\\nu^{2}}{6}.$$\n\nThese two schemes have identical formal truncation order $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^{2}, \\Delta x^{2})$, but their modified equations differ at the leading dispersive order. The coefficient $\\beta_{\\mathrm{LW}}(\\nu) = (\\nu^2-1)/6$ is negative for $\\nu  1$, indicating a phase lag ($c_{\\mathrm{num}}  a$). The coefficient $\\beta_{\\mathrm{BW}}(\\nu) = (\\nu-1)(\\nu-2)/6$ is positive for $\\nu  1$, indicating a phase lead ($c_{\\mathrm{num}} > a$). In computational geophysics, where accurate phase is critical for wavefield interference, migration, and inversion, these distinct $\\beta_{s}(\\nu)$ lead to markedly different fidelity. The sign and magnitude of $\\beta_{s}$ control numerical dispersion of wave packets, altering arrival times and phase coherence even though both methods are second-order by big-O truncation order.\n\nFinally, the requested difference in leading phase error coefficients is\n$$\\Delta\\beta(\\nu) = \\beta_{\\mathrm{BW}}(\\nu) - \\beta_{\\mathrm{LW}}(\\nu) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{\\nu}{2} + \\frac{\\nu^{2}}{6}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\nu^{2}}{6} - \\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{\\nu}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\nu}{2} = \\frac{1 - \\nu}{2}.$$\nThis closed-form expression quantifies, for a given $\\nu$, how two schemes with identical truncation order nevertheless induce different leading-order numerical dispersion in the geophysical wavefield.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1-\\nu}{2}}$$", "id": "3612459"}]}
