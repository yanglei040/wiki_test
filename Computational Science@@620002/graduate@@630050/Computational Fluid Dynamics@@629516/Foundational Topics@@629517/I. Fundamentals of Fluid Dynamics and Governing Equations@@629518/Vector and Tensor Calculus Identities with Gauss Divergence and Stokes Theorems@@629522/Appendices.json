In Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$, we have $u_1 = \\frac{U}{H} x_2$, $u_2=0$, $u_3=0$. The velocity gradient tensor has components $(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})_{ij} = \\partial_j u_i$.\nThe only non-zero partial derivative of the velocity components is:\n$$\n\\partial_2 u_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{U}{H} y \\right) = \\frac{U}{H}\n$$\nAll other components $\\partial_j u_i$ are zero. Thus, the velocity gradient tensor is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_x u_x & \\partial_y u_x & \\partial_z u_x \\\\ \\partial_x u_y & \\partial_y u_y & \\partial_z u_y \\\\ \\partial_x u_z & \\partial_y u_z & \\partial_z u_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{U}{H} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe double contraction $\\nabla \\mathbf{u} : \\nabla \\mathbf{u}$ is the sum of the squares of all components of this tensor:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mathbf{u} : \\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\sum_{i,j} ((\\nabla \\mathbf{u})_{ij})^2 = \\left(\\frac{U}{H}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis quantity is constant throughout the entire fluid volume $\\Omega$. The total volume is given as $V = A H$.\nWe can now compute the volume integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\mathbf{u} : \\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left(\\frac{U}{H}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\left(\\frac{U^2}{H^2}\\right) \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\left(\\frac{U^2}{H^2}\\right) (A H) = \\frac{U^2 A}{H}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation using the Derived Identity and Verification**\n\nWe now use the identity from Part 1 to calculate the same integral. First, we evaluate the terms for the given Couette flow. The Laplacian of the velocity field is $\\Delta \\mathbf{u} = (\\Delta u_1, \\Delta u_2, \\Delta u_3)$.\n$$\n\\Delta u_1 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{U}{H} y\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $u_2=0$ and $u_3=0$, their Laplacians are also zero. Therefore, $\\Delta \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$. The velocity field is harmonic.\nThe identity from Part 1 simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\mathbf{u} : \\nabla \\mathbf{u} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\nabla\\left(\\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{u}|^2\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, \\mathrm{d}S\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the integrand of the surface integral.\n$|\\mathbf{u}|^2 = u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2 = \\left(\\frac{U}{H} y\\right)^2 = \\frac{U^2}{H^2} y^2$.\nThe gradient of $\\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{u}|^2$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla\\left(\\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{u}|^2\\right) = \\nabla\\left(\\frac{U^2}{2H^2} y^2\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right) \\left(\\frac{U^2}{2H^2} y^2\\right) = \\left(0, \\frac{U^2}{H^2} y, 0\\right)\n$$\nThe boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ consists of the top and bottom plates and the periodic boundaries.\n- On the periodic boundaries in $x$ and $z$, the outward normal vectors $\\mathbf{n}$ are perpendicular to the $y$-axis (e.g., $\\mathbf{n} = (\\pm 1, 0, 0)$ or $\\mathbf{n} = (0, 0, \\pm 1)$). The integrand vector is $(0, \\frac{U^2}{H^2}y, 0)$. Thus, their dot product is zero. The integrals over the periodic surfaces vanish.\n- On the lower plate at $y=0$, the outward normal is $\\mathbf{n}=(0, -1, 0)$. The integrand vector evaluated at $y=0$ is $(0, 0, 0)$. The dot product is zero, so this integral also vanishes.\n- On the upper plate at $y=H$, the outward normal is $\\mathbf{n}=(0, 1, 0)$. The integrand vector evaluated at $y=H$ is $(0, \\frac{U^2}{H^2}H, 0) = (0, \\frac{U^2}{H}, 0)$. The dot product is:\n$$\n\\left( 0, \\frac{U^2}{H}, 0 \\right) \\cdot (0, 1, 0) = \\frac{U^2}{H}\n$$\nThis value is constant over the upper plate's area $A$. The integral over the upper plate is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\text{top plate}} \\frac{U^2}{H} \\, \\mathrm{d}S = \\frac{U^2}{H} \\times (\\text{Area of top plate}) = \\frac{U^2 A}{H}\n$$\nSumming the contributions from all boundary surfaces, the total surface integral is $\\frac{U^2 A}{H}$.\nThis result, $\\frac{U^2 A}{H}$, is identical to the one obtained in Part 2. The consistency is verified.\n\n**Part 4: Total Viscous Power Dissipation**\n\nThe total viscous power dissipation is $P = \\int_{\\Omega} \\tau : \\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$, with the viscous stress tensor $\\tau = \\mu \\left(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}\\right)$. The integrand is the local dissipation density, $\\Phi = \\tau : \\nabla \\mathbf{u}$.\n$$\n\\Phi = \\left[ \\mu \\left(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}\\right) \\right] : \\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\mu \\left( (\\nabla \\mathbf{u}:\\nabla\\mathbf{u}) + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}:\\nabla\\mathbf{u}) \\right)\n$$\nWe have already calculated $\\nabla \\mathbf{u} : \\nabla \\mathbf{u} = (\\frac{U}{H})^2$. We need to calculate $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}:\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$.\nThe transpose of the velocity gradient tensor is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{U}{H} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe double contraction $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}:\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$ is the sum of the element-wise products of the components of $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}$ and $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}:\\nabla\\mathbf{u} = \\sum_{i,j} (\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top})_{ij} (\\nabla \\mathbfu)_{ij}\n$$\nThe only non-zero element in $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$ is at position $(1,2)$, while the only non-zero element in $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}$ is at position $(2,1)$. As there is no position $(i,j)$ where both tensors have a non-zero element, the element-wise product is zero for all $(i,j)$. Therefore, the sum is zero:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{\\top}:\\nabla\\mathbf{u} = 0\n$$\nThe local dissipation density is therefore:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\mu \\left( \\left(\\frac{U}{H}\\right)^2 + 0 \\right) = \\mu \\frac{U^2}{H^2}\n$$\nThis value is constant throughout the fluid. To find the total power dissipation $P$, we integrate $\\Phi$ over the volume $\\Omega$:\n$$\nP = \\int_{\\Omega} \\Phi \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega} \\mu \\frac{U^2}{H^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\mu \\frac{U^2}{H^2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\mu \\frac{U^2}{H^2} (A H) = \\frac{\\mu U^2 A}{H}\n$$\nThe total viscous power dissipation is a function of the fluid viscosity, the geometry, and the plate velocity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\mu U^{2} A}{H}}\n$$", "id": "3387805"}]}
