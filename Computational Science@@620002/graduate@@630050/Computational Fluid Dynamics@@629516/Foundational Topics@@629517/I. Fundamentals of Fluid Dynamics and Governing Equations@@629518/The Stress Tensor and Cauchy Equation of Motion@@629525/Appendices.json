The starting point is the local balance of linear momentum and the Cauchy stress principle.\n\nThe local balance of linear momentum, or Cauchy's first law of motion, is expressed by the equation:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{Dt} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{b} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field, $\\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the body force per unit volume.\n\nThe problem states that the fluid is at rest, which implies the velocity field is zero, $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$. Consequently, the material derivative of velocity, which represents acceleration, is also zero, $\\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{Dt} = \\mathbf{0}$. Furthermore, it is given that body forces can be neglected, so $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$. Under these conditions, the momentum balance equation simplifies to the static equilibrium equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe problem specifies a constant Cauchy stress tensor. For a constant tensor, all its spatial derivatives are zero, so its divergence, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, is identically zero. This confirms that the given constant stress field is a valid solution to the static equilibrium equation, ensuring the consistency of the problem statement.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the application of the Cauchy stress principle, which states that the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ (force per unit area) acting on a surface is a linear function of the unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ to that surface. This relationship is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{n} $$\nThe problem specifies a constant Cauchy stress tensor that is symmetric ($\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T$), which is required for a fluid in equilibrium without body couples.\n\nThe given nondimensional Cauchy stress tensor is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2  1  0 \\\\ 1  3  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAnd the unit normal vector to the plane is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe can now calculate the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ by performing the matrix-vector multiplication:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\mathbf{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1  0 \\\\ 1  3  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) + (1)(1) + (0)(0) \\\\ (1)(1) + (3)(1) + (0)(0) \\\\ (0)(1) + (0)(1) + (1)(0) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\ 2\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe next step is to decompose the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ into its component normal to the plane, $\\mathbf{t}_n$, and its component tangential (or shear) to the plane, $\\mathbf{t}_s$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental equations of continuum mechanics. For a general fluid, Cauchy's equation of motion, representing the conservation of linear momentum, is:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{Dt} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\rho\\mathbf{b} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector, $\\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the body force per unit mass.\n\nFor an incompressible Newtonian fluid, the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is related to the fluid motion through the constitutive relation:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\mu \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{v})^T \\right) $$\nwhere $p$ is the thermodynamic pressure, $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the viscous stress tensor, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\nabla\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity gradient tensor.\n\nThe problem states that there are no body forces, so $\\rho\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$. The flow is steady, so all time derivatives $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ are zero. The velocity field is given as $\\mathbf{v} = \\big(u(y), 0, 0\\big)$. The material derivative is $\\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}$. With $\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} = \\mathbf{0}$, this reduces to:\n$$ (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = \\left( u(y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 0\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + 0\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} u(y) \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} u(y)\\frac{\\partial u(y)}{\\partial x} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $u$ is a function of $y$ only, its partial derivative with respect to $x$ is zero. Thus, $(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$, which means the acceleration term $\\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{Dt}$ is identically zero. Cauchy's equation of motion simplifies to the momentum balance equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0} $$\n\nNext, we determine the components of the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. First, we compute the velocity gradient tensor $\\nabla\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$ \\nabla\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWith $\\mathbf{v} = \\big(u(y), 0, 0\\big)$, we have $v=0$ and $w=0$. Also, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$ (fully developed flow) and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = 0$ (two-dimensional flow). The only non-zero component of the velocity gradient is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{du}{dy}$.\n$$ \\nabla\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{du}{dy}  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe term $\\nabla\\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{v})^T$ is:\n$$ \\nabla\\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{v})^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{du}{dy}  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ \\frac{du}{dy}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{du}{dy}  0 \\\\ \\frac{du}{dy}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\mu(\\nabla\\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{v})^T)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p  \\mu\\frac{du}{dy}  0 \\\\ \\mu\\frac{du}{dy}  -p  0 \\\\ 0  0  -p \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components of the stress tensor are $\\sigma_{xx} = -p$, $\\sigma_{yy} = -p$, $\\sigma_{zz} = -p$, and $\\sigma_{xy} = \\sigma_{yx} = \\mu\\frac{du}{dy}$. All other components are zero.\n\nNow, we verify that this stress distribution is consistent with the momentum balance $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$. We expand this vector equation into its components:\n- $x$-component: $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{yx}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{zx}}{\\partial z} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial(-p)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\mu\\frac{du}{dy}\\right) + 0 = 0$. Since $\\mu$ is constant, this becomes $-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu\\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = 0$.\n- $y$-component: $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{xy}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{yy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{zy}}{\\partial z} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\mu\\frac{du}{dy}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial(-p)}{\\partial y} + 0 = 0$. Since $u$ depends only on $y$, $\\frac{du}{dy}$ is not a function of $x$, so its partial derivative with respect to $x$ is zero. This simplifies to $-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n- $z$-component: $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{yz}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0 \\implies 0 + 0 + \\frac{\\partial(-p)}{\\partial z} = 0$, which gives $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\nFrom the $y$- and $z$-momentum equations, we conclude that the pressure $p$ is a function of $x$ only, $p=p(x)$. The $x$-momentum equation can then be written as $\\mu\\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = \\frac{dp}{dx}$. The problem states there is no externally imposed pressure gradient, which for this geometry implies $\\frac{dp}{dx}=0$. Therefore, the momentum equation for the given flow simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = 0 $$\nThe problem provides the experimentally observed velocity profile $u(y) = \\frac{Uy}{H}$. Let's check if it satisfies this equation.\nThe first derivative is $\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{Uy}{H}\\right) = \\frac{U}{H}$.\nThe second derivative is $\\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{U}{H}\\right) = 0$.\nThe given velocity profile is indeed a solution to the simplified momentum equation, confirming the consistency of the problem statement.\n\nThe task is to derive the shear stress distribution throughout the gap. The only non-zero shear stress component is $\\sigma_{xy}$ (which is equal to $\\sigma_{yx}$ as the tensor is symmetric).\nThe shear stress distribution as a function of $y$ is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}(y) = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy} $$\nSubstituting the derivative of the given velocity profile, we find:\n$$ \\sigma_{xy}(y) = \\mu \\left(\\frac{U}{H}\\right) $$\nThis shows that the shear stress is constant throughout the fluid, independent of the position $y$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to extract the constant shear stress acting on any plane with a unit normal in the $+y$-direction, with the force acting in the $+x$-direction. This corresponds precisely to the stress component $\\sigma_{yx}$, or equivalently $\\sigma_{xy}$. As derived, this value is constant.\n$$ \\sigma_{xy} = \\mu \\frac{U}{H} $$\nThis expression represents the shear stress exerted by a fluid layer at a given $y$ on the fluid layer below it, and ultimately the stress exerted by the fluid on the stationary bottom plate at $y=0$. By Newton's third law, the force exerted by the moving plate on the fluid is equal and opposite. The shear stress on the upper plate is also $\\mu \\frac{U}{H}$.\nThe final answer is this analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mu \\frac{U}{H}}$$", "id": "3382779"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice bridges theory with computational reality by investigating a crucial property of the Cauchy stress tensor: its symmetry.

The effect of symmetrizing the stress tensor is to be quantified.\n\nThe discrete torque is given by the sum over the six faces of the cube:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}=\\sum_{f\\in\\{\\pm x,\\pm y,\\pm z\\}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{f}\\times\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}_{f}\\right)\\right)A_{f}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{x}_f$ is the face centroid, $\\boldsymbol{n}_f$ its outward normal, and $A_f=L^2$ is its area.\n\nThe stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ can be uniquely decomposed into its symmetric part $\\boldsymbol{S}$ and its antisymmetric part $\\boldsymbol{A}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{S} + \\boldsymbol{A}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{S} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T)$ and $\\boldsymbol{A} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T)$.\n\nBy the linearity of the cross product and the tensor-vector product, the total discrete torque can be written as the sum of contributions from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sum_{f} \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{f}\\times\\left((\\boldsymbol{S}+\\boldsymbol{A})\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}_{f}\\right)\\right)A_{f} = \\sum_{f} \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{f}\\times\\left(\\boldsymbol{S}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}_{f}\\right)\\right)A_{f} + \\sum_{f} \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{f}\\times\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}_{f}\\right)\\right)A_{f}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{S}) + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{A})\n$$\nFirst, we analyze the torque contribution from the symmetric part, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{S})$. The symmetrized stress tensor is, by definition, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{sym}} = \\boldsymbol{S}$. In index notation, the $i$-th component of the torque from $\\boldsymbol{S}$ is:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{S}))_i = \\sum_{f} \\epsilon_{ijk} (\\boldsymbol{x}_f)_j ((\\boldsymbol{S}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}_f)_k) A_f = L^2 \\sum_{f} \\epsilon_{ijk} (\\boldsymbol{x}_f)_j S_{kl} (\\boldsymbol{n}_f)_l\n$$\nWe sum over pairs of opposite faces. For the faces at $x=\\pm L/2$, we have $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\pm x} = (\\pm L/2, 0, 0)$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_{\\pm x} = (\\pm 1, 0, 0)$. Their contribution is:\n$$\nL^2 \\left( \\epsilon_{ijk} (L/2)\\delta_{j1} S_{kl} \\delta_{l1} + \\epsilon_{ijk} (-L/2)\\delta_{j1} S_{kl} (-\\delta_{l1}) \\right) = L^2 (L/2) (\\epsilon_{i1k}S_{k1}) + L^2 (L/2) (\\epsilon_{i1k}S_{k1}) = L^3 \\epsilon_{i1k}S_{k1}\n$$\nSimilarly, the contributions from the $\\pm y$ and $\\pm z$ faces are $L^3 \\epsilon_{i2k}S_{k2}$ and $L^3 \\epsilon_{i3k}S_{k3}$, respectively. Summing all contributions:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{S}))_i = L^3 (\\epsilon_{i1k}S_{k1} + \\epsilon_{i2k}S_{k2} + \\epsilon_{i3k}S_{k3}) = L^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\epsilon_{ijk} S_{kj}\n$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{S}$ is symmetric, $S_{kj} = S_{jk}$. The Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of indices $j$ and $k$. The contraction of a symmetric tensor with an antisymmetric tensor over those indices is zero:\n$$\n\\sum_{j,k} \\epsilon_{ijk} S_{jk} = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the torque from the symmetric part of the stress is identically zero: $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{S}) = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The symmetrized stress is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{sym}} = \\boldsymbol{S}$, so it follows that for all cases, $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{sym}})\\|_{2} = 0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the torque contribution from the antisymmetric part, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{A})$. The problem provides the identity relating the action of an antisymmetric tensor to its axial vector $\\boldsymbol{a}$: $\\boldsymbol{A}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\boldsymbol{n}$. Substituting this into the formula for $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{A})$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{A}) = L^2 \\sum_{f} \\boldsymbol{x}_{f} \\times (\\boldsymbol{a} \\times \\boldsymbol{n}_{f})\n$$\nUsing the vector triple product identity $\\boldsymbol{u}\\times(\\boldsymbol{v}\\times\\boldsymbol{w}) = (\\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{w})\\boldsymbol{v} - (\\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v})\\boldsymbol{w}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{A}) = L^2 \\sum_{f} [ (\\boldsymbol{x}_f \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_f)\\boldsymbol{a} - (\\boldsymbol{x}_f \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a})\\boldsymbol{n}_f ]\n$$\nFor any pair of opposite faces, e.g., at $\\pm x$, we have $\\boldsymbol{x}_{-x} = -\\boldsymbol{x}_{+x}$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_{-x} = -\\boldsymbol{n}_{+x}$. The centroids are $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\pm x} = (\\pm L/2, 0, 0)$, so $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\pm x} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_{\\pm x} = L/2$. The contribution from this pair is:\n$$\nL^2 \\left[ ((L/2)\\boldsymbol{a} - (\\boldsymbol{x}_{+x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{a})\\boldsymbol{n}_{+x}) + ((L/2)\\boldsymbol{a} - (\\boldsymbol{x}_{-x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{a})\\boldsymbol{n}_{-x}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= L^2 \\left[ L\\boldsymbol{a} - \\left( (L/2)a_x \\boldsymbol{e}_x \\right) - \\left( (-L/2)a_x (-\\boldsymbol{e}_x) \\right) \\right] = L^2 [ L\\boldsymbol{a} - L a_x \\boldsymbol{e}_x ] = L^3 (\\boldsymbol{a} - a_x\\boldsymbol{e}_x)\n$$\nSumming over the three pairs of faces (for $x, y, z$):\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{A}) = L^3 (\\boldsymbol{a} - a_x\\boldsymbol{e}_x) + L^3 (\\boldsymbol{a} - a_y\\boldsymbol{e}_y) + L^3 (\\boldsymbol{a} - a_z\\boldsymbol{e}_z)\n$$\n$$\n= L^3 [ 3\\boldsymbol{a} - (a_x\\boldsymbol{e}_x + a_y\\boldsymbol{e}_y + a_z\\boldsymbol{e}_z) ] = L^3 [ 3\\boldsymbol{a} - \\boldsymbol{a} ] = 2 L^3 \\boldsymbol{a}\n$$\nThis derivation shows that the total discrete torque is determined solely by the antisymmetric part of the stress tensor and is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 2L^3 \\boldsymbol{a}$. The volume of the cube is $V=L^3$, so $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 2V\\boldsymbol{a}$. This matches the exact result from continuum mechanics for a constant stress field.\n\nThe required calculations are thus simplified to:\n$1$. The magnitude of the torque before symmetrization is $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\|_{2} = \\|2 L^3 \\boldsymbol{a}\\|_{2} = 2 L^3 \\|\\boldsymbol{a}\\|_{2}$. The units are $(\\mathrm{m^3}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{Pa}) = (\\mathrm{m^3}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{N/m^2}) = \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$, which is correct.\n$2$. The magnitude of the torque after symmetrization is $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{disc}}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{sym}})\\|_{2} = 0$.\n\nThe implementation will apply these derived formulae to each test case.
