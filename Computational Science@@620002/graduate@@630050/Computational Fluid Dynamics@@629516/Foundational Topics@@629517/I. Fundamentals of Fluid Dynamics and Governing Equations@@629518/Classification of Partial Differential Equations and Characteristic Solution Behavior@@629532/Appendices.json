A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n### Solution\nThe given second-order linear partial differential equation is:\n$$\nu_{xx} + 2u_{xy} - u_{yy} = 0\n$$\nThe principal part of this PDE can be associated with a quadratic form. For a general second-order PDE $A u_{xx} + B u_{xy} + C u_{yy} + \\dots = 0$, the quadratic form is represented by a symmetric matrix. Note that the coefficient of the mixed derivative is typically written as $2B'$ in the matrix representation $A u_{xx} + 2B' u_{xy} + C u_{yy}$. In our case, the equation is $u_{xx} + 2u_{xy} - u_{yy} = 0$, so we identify the coefficients as $A=1$, $C=-1$, and the mixed term coefficient is $2$, which corresponds to $B$ in the general form $Au_{xx}+Bu_{xy}+Cu_{yy}...$ or $2B'$ if we use the symmetric matrix convention. The symmetric coefficient matrix $M$ for the principal part's operator is given by:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} A & B/2 \\\\ B/2 & C \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor the given PDE, $A=1$, the full mixed coefficient is $2$, so $B/2=1$, and $C=-1$. The matrix is:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**1. Derivation of the Orthogonal Transformation**\n\nWe seek an orthogonal transformation (a rotation of the coordinate system) that diagonalizes the matrix $M$. Let the new coordinates be $(\\xi, \\eta)$ related to $(x, y)$ by a rotation through an angle $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\xi \\\\ \\eta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet the rotation matrix be $R_\\theta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$. The inverse transformation is $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = R_\\theta^T \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi \\\\ \\eta \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe partial derivative operators transform according to the chain rule. The gradient vector transforms as $\\nabla_{(x,y)} = R_\\theta^T \\nabla_{(\\xi,\\eta)}$.\nThe quadratic form associated with the PDE operator is $\\nabla_{(x,y)}^T M \\nabla_{(x,y)}$. In the new coordinate system, this becomes:\n$$\n(R_\\theta^T \\nabla_{(\\xi,\\eta)})^T M (R_\\theta^T \\nabla_{(\\xi,\\eta)}) = \\nabla_{(\\xi,\\eta)}^T (R_\\theta M R_\\theta^T) \\nabla_{(\\xi,\\eta)}\n$$\nThe new coefficient matrix in the $(\\xi, \\eta)$ system is $M' = R_\\theta M R_\\theta^T$. To eliminate the mixed derivative term $u_{\\xi\\eta}$, the off-diagonal elements of $M'$ must be zero. Let's compute $M'$:\n$$\nM' = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the product $R_\\theta M$:\n$$\nR_\\theta M = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta + \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we post-multiply by $R_\\theta^T$:\n$$\nM' = (R_\\theta M) R_\\theta^T = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta + \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe off-diagonal element $M'_{12}$ (which is equal to $M'_{21}$ as $M'$ is symmetric) is:\n$$\nM'_{12} = (\\cos\\theta + \\sin\\theta)(-\\sin\\theta) + (\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta)(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\n$$\nM'_{12} = -\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\n$$\n$$\nM'_{12} = \\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta - 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = \\cos(2\\theta) - \\sin(2\\theta)\n$$\nTo eliminate the mixed derivative term, we must set this off-diagonal element to zero:\n$$\n\\cos(2\\theta) - \\sin(2\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\cos(2\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta)\n$$\nAssuming $\\cos(2\\theta) \\neq 0$, we can divide by it to get:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) = 1\n$$\nThis is the condition on the rotation angle $\\theta$. The principal value for $2\\theta$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Thus, the required rotation angle is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{8}\n$$\n\n**2. Canonical Form of the PDE**\n\nWith the mixed derivative term eliminated, the transformed PDE has the form $A' u_{\\xi\\xi} + C' u_{\\eta\\eta} = 0$, where $A' = M'_{11}$ and $C' = M'_{22}$. These are the eigenvalues of the original matrix $M$.\nLet's compute the diagonal elements of $M'$ with $2\\theta = \\pi/4$, which gives $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n$$\nM'_{11} = (\\cos\\theta + \\sin\\theta)\\cos\\theta + (\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta)\\sin\\theta = \\cos^2\\theta + \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta + \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\nM'_{11} = (\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta) + 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = \\cos(2\\theta) + \\sin(2\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n$$\nM'_{22} = (-\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta)(-\\sin\\theta) + (-\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta)(\\cos\\theta) = \\sin^2\\theta - \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - \\cos^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\nM'_{22} = -(\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta) - 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = -\\cos(2\\theta) - \\sin(2\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThe transformed PDE for the principal part is:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} u_{\\xi\\xi} - \\sqrt{2} u_{\\eta\\eta} = 0\n$$\nTo obtain the canonical form with normalized coefficients, we divide by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$\nu_{\\xi\\xi} - u_{\\eta\\eta} = 0\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional wave equation, which is the canonical form for a hyperbolic PDE in two dimensions.\n\n**3. Classification and Verification**\n\nThe classification of the PDE is determined by the signs of the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix $M$. The eigenvalues are the coefficients $A'$ and $C'$ of the canonical form, which are $\\lambda_1 = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\lambda_2 = -\\sqrt{2}$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs (one positive, one negative), the PDE is **hyperbolic**.\n\nThis classification is consistent with the traditional discriminant test. For $A u_{xx} + B u_{xy} + C u_{yy} = 0$, the discriminant is $B^2-4AC$. For our equation $1 \\cdot u_{xx} + 2 \\cdot u_{xy} - 1 \\cdot u_{yy} = 0$, we have $A=1$, $B=2$, $C=-1$. The discriminant is:\n$$\nB^2 - 4AC = (2)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 4 + 4 = 8 > 0\n$$\nA positive discriminant confirms the PDE is hyperbolic.\n\nTo verify by determining the characteristic directions, we solve the characteristic equation:\n$$\nA \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 - B \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) + C = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the coefficients $A=1$, $B=2$, $C=-1$:\n$$\n(1) \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 - (2) \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right) + (-1) = 0\n$$\nLet $m = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The quadratic equation for the slope of the characteristic curves is:\n$$\nm^2 - 2m - 1 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $m$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nm = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+4}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nSince there are two distinct real roots for the slope, $m_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$ and $m_2 = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$, there exist two distinct families of real characteristic curves. This is the defining property of a hyperbolic PDE, thus verifying our classification. The families of characteristic curves are given by the equations $y - (1+\\sqrt{2})x = \\text{const}$ and $y - (1-\\sqrt{2})x = \\text{const}$.\n\nThe final requested answer is the rotation angle $\\theta$.

It presents a standard problem in the study of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations, specifically the formation of shocks in the inviscid Burgers equation, which is a key topic in computational fluid dynamics. All parameters are well-defined and dimensionally consistent. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem concerns the one-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation, a first-order quasilinear partial differential equation (PDE), given by\n$u_t + u u_x = 0$\nwith the initial condition $u(x,0) = u_0(x) = U_{\\infty} + A\\sin(k x) + B x$.\n\nFirst, we classify the equation and analyze its solution behavior. The equation is of the form $a u_t + b u_x = c$, with $a=1$, $b=u$, and $c=0$. The method of characteristics is employed to solve this PDE. The characteristic curves in the $(x,t)$ plane are defined by the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1, \\quad \\frac{dx}{ds} = u, \\quad \\frac{du}{ds} = 0\n$$\nwhere $s$ is a parameter along the characteristic. Choosing $s=t$ (with initial condition $t(0)=0$), the system simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = u, \\quad \\frac{du}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThe second equation, $\\frac{du}{dt}=0$, signifies that the velocity $u$ is conserved along a characteristic curve. The first equation, $\\frac{dx}{dt}=u$, defines the slope of the characteristic curve in the $(x,t)$ plane. The speed of propagation of information, or the characteristic speed, is $\\lambda = u$. Since this speed is a real value, the equation is classified as **hyperbolic**.\n\nThe nonlinearity of the equation, where the characteristic speed $u$ depends on the solution itself, leads to the potential for wave steepening and shock formation. Because $u$ is constant along a characteristic, each characteristic is a straight line. The equation for a characteristic originating from an initial position $x=\\xi$ at $t=0$ is $x(t) = \\xi + u(x(0),0)t = \\xi + u_0(\\xi)t$. Regions with higher initial velocity $u_0(\\xi)$ will travel faster. If a region of high velocity is initially located behind a region of lower velocity (i.e., $u_0(\\xi_1) > u_0(\\xi_2)$ for $\\xi_1 < \\xi_2$), the faster-moving characteristic from $\\xi_1$ will eventually overtake the slower-moving one from $\\xi_2$. At the point of intersection, the solution would become multi-valued, which is non-physical. This breakdown of the classical, single-valued solution is known as a gradient catastrophe, and it is resolved by the formation of a shock wave, which is a discontinuity in the solution $u$.\n\nNext, we derive the implicit solution representation. Let $\\xi$ be the Lagrangian coordinate identifying a fluid particle by its initial position at $t=0$. Along the characteristic path $x(t)$ starting at $x(0)=\\xi$, the velocity is constant and equal to its initial value:\n$$u(x(t),t) = u_0(\\xi)$$\nThe position $x$ at time $t$ is found by integrating $\\frac{dx}{dt} = u_0(\\xi)$ with the initial condition $x(0)=\\xi$:\n$$x = \\xi + u_0(\\xi) t$$\nThese two equations provide the implicit representation of the solution $u(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nu(x,t) = u_0(\\xi) \\\\\nx = \\xi + u_0(\\xi) t\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo find the value of $u$ at a specific point $(x,t)$, one must first solve the second equation for $\\xi$ and substitute it into the first.\n\nFinally, we determine the criterion for the first gradient catastrophe and compute the earliest shock formation time, $t_{shock}$. A shock first forms at the time $t$ and location $x$ where characteristics originating from infinitesimally close initial points $\\xi$ and $\\xi+d\\xi$ first intersect. This corresponds to the condition where the mapping from $\\xi$ to $x$ becomes singular for a fixed $t > 0$. Mathematically, this occurs when the derivative $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi}$ becomes zero. Differentiating the characteristic equation with respect to $\\xi$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi} = 1 + \\frac{du_0}{d\\xi} t = 1 + u_0'(\\xi) t$$\nSetting this derivative to zero gives the time at which the characteristic originating from $\\xi$ contributes to a shock:\n$$t = -\\frac{1}{u_0'(\\xi)}$$\nFor a shock to form at a positive time $t$, it is necessary that $u_0'(\\xi) < 0$. This condition corresponds to a compressive region, where the velocity of the fluid is decreasing with position. The earliest shock time, $t_{shock}$, is the minimum of these positive times over all possible initial positions $\\xi$:\n$$t_{shock} = \\min_{\\xi \\text{ s.t. } u_0'(\\xi)<0} \\left( -\\frac{1}{u_0'(\\xi)} \\right)$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the time corresponding to the most negative value of $u_0'(\\xi)$:\n$$t_{shock} = -\\frac{1}{\\min_{\\xi} u_0'(\\xi)}$$\nFor the given initial condition $u_0(x) = U_{\\infty} + A\\sin(k x) + B x$, we first find its derivative with respect to the initial position $\\xi$:\n$$u_0'(\\xi) = \\frac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( U_{\\infty} + A\\sin(k \\xi) + B \\xi \\right) = A k \\cos(k \\xi) + B$$\nWe need to find the minimum value of this expression. The function $\\cos(k\\xi)$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$. Since the problem states $A>0$ and $k>0$, the term $A k$ is positive.

This ensures that $t_{shock}$ will be positive.\nSubstituting the minimum value into the formula for $t_{shock}$:\n$$t_{shock} = -\\frac{1}{B - A k} = \\frac{1}{A k - B}$$\nThis is the earliest time at which a shock wave forms from the given smooth initial data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{Ak - B}}$$", "id": "3301836"}, {"introduction": "Once a shock wave has formed, the differential form of the conservation law is no longer valid across the discontinuity, and a new set of rules is required to describe its evolution.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of hyperbolic conservation laws, a sub-discipline of computational fluid dynamics.

For this problem, we are given the inviscid Burgers equation, for which the flux function is $f(u) = \\frac{u^2}{2}$.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation to start from the integral statement of conservation applied to a moving control volume. Let the control volume be the interval $[x_1(t), x_2(t)]$. The total amount of the conserved quantity $u$ within this volume is $\\int_{x_1(t)}^{x_2(t)} u(x,t) \\, dx$. The principle of conservation states that the rate of change of this total amount is equal to the net flux into the volume. The flux across a boundary moving with velocity $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ is given by $f(u) - u \\frac{dx}{dt}$. Therefore, the integral form of the conservation law for a moving control volume is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_1(t)}^{x_2(t)} u(x,t) \\, dx = \\left[ f(u(x_1,t)) - u(x_1,t)\\frac{dx_1}{dt} \\right] - \\left[ f(u(x_2,t)) - u(x_2,t)\\frac{dx_2}{dt} \\right]\n$$\nThis can also be derived using the Leibniz integral rule on $\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_1(t)}^{x_2(t)} u \\, dx$ and substituting $u_t = -f(u)_x$.\n\nWe consider a solution with a single discontinuity (a shock) located at position $x_s(t)$, which propagates with speed $s = \\frac{dx_s}{dt}$. The solution is piecewise constant, with state $u_L$ to the left of the shock ($x < x_s(t)$) and state $u_R$ to the right of the shock ($x > x_s(t)$).\n\nWe choose a control volume that moves with the shock. Let $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ be infinitesimally close to the shock, such that $x_1(t) \\to x_s(t)^{-}$ and $x_2(t) \\to x_s(t)^{+}$. In this limit, the velocities of the control volume boundaries are equal to the shock speed: $\\frac{dx_1}{dt} = \\frac{dx_2}{dt} = s$. As the width of the control volume $x_2(t) - x_1(t)$ approaches zero, the integral $\\int_{x_1(t)}^{x_2(t)} u(x,t) \\, dx$ also approaches zero. Assuming $u$ is bounded, the time derivative of this integral must also be zero in the limit. The conservation law thus simplifies to:\n$$\n0 = \\left[ f(u_L) - u_L s \\right] - \\left[ f(u_R) - u_R s \\right]\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the shock speed $s$ yields:\n$$\ns(u_L - u_R) = f(u_L) - f(u_R)\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{f(u_L) - f(u_R)}{u_L - u_R}\n$$\nThis is the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which gives the propagation speed of a discontinuity.\n\nFor the inviscid Burgers equation, $f(u) = \\frac{u^{2}}{2}$.

This means the characteristic speed to the left of the shock must be greater than the shock speed, and the characteristic speed to the right must be less than the shock speed. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nc(u_L) > s > c(u_R)\n$$\nWe now verify this condition with the given and calculated values:\nThe characteristic speed on the left is $c(u_L) = u_L = 2$.\nThe characteristic speed on the right is $c(u_R) = u_R = -1$.\nThe shock speed is $s = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the admissibility condition:\n$$\n2 > \\frac{1}{2} > -1\n$$\nBoth inequalities, $2 > \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{2} > -1$, are true.
