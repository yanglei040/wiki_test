We substitute these into the equation. The derivatives transform as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} = \\frac{1}{t_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{t}}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla = \\frac{1}{L}\\tilde{\\nabla} \\implies \\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{L^2}\\tilde{\\nabla}^2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the momentum equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{U}{t_0} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + (U\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\tilde{\\nabla}\\right) (U\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\tilde{\\nabla}\\right) (\\rho U^2 \\tilde{p}) + \\nu \\left(\\frac{1}{L^2}\\tilde{\\nabla}^2\\right) (U\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}})\n$$\nSimplifying the terms:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{U}{t_0}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\left(\\frac{U^2}{L}\\right) \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\cdot\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = -\\left(\\frac{U^2}{L}\\right) \\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{p} + \\left(\\frac{\\nu U}{L^2}\\right) \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\n$$\nTo obtain the standard nondimensional form, we divide all terms by the coefficient of the advective term, $U^2/L$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{U}{t_0} \\frac{L}{U^2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\cdot\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = -\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{p} + \\left(\\frac{\\nu U}{L^2} \\frac{L}{U^2}\\right) \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{L}{U t_0}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\cdot\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = -\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{p} + \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{UL}\\right) \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies choosing the advective time scale, $t_0 = L/U$. Substituting this choice:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{L}{U (L/U)}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\cdot\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = -\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{p} + \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{UL}\\right) \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\cdot\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = -\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{p} + \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re}} \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\n$$\nThis derivation confirms that the parameter multiplying the viscous term is the inverse of the Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re} = UL/\\nu$.\n\n**Part 2: Expression for the Nondimensional Time Step $\\Delta \\tilde{t}$**\n\nThe given definitions are $C = U \\Delta t / \\Delta x$, $t = t_0 \\tilde{t}$, and $x_i = L \\tilde{x}_i$. From these, we can write the relationships for the discrete steps:\n$$\n\\Delta t = t_0 \\Delta \\tilde{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta x = L \\Delta \\tilde{x}\n$$\nWe substitute these into the definition of the CFL number $C$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{U (t_0 \\Delta \\tilde{t})}{L \\Delta \\tilde{x}}\n$$\nUsing the specified advective time scale $t_0 = L/U$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{U ( (L/U) \\Delta \\tilde{t} )}{L \\Delta \\tilde{x}} = \\frac{L \\Delta \\tilde{t}}{L \\Delta \\tilde{x}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\tilde{t}}{\\Delta \\tilde{x}}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the dimensional grid spacing $\\Delta x$ and the characteristic length $L$, we use $\\Delta \\tilde{x} = \\Delta x / L$.\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\Delta \\tilde{t}}{\\Delta x / L} \\implies \\Delta \\tilde{t} = C \\left( \\frac{\\Delta x}{L} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required relationship.\n\n**Part 3: Justification for the Choice of $t_0 = L/U$**\n\nFor an explicit time integration scheme, the stability of the advection term is governed by the CFL condition. In nondimensional form, this condition relates the nondimensional time step $\\Delta \\tilde{t}$ to the nondimensional grid spacing $\\Delta \\tilde{x}$. For a simple linear advection equation with velocity $\\tilde{u}$, the stability constraint is $|\\tilde{u}| \\Delta \\tilde{t} / \\Delta \\tilde{x} \\le C_{max}$, where $C_{max}$ is a constant (typically of order $1$) that depends on the specific numerical scheme.\n\nWith our chosen scaling, the nondimensional velocity $\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}$ is of order $1$, so the stability constraint simplifies to $\\Delta \\tilde{t} / \\Delta \\tilde{x} \\lesssim 1$. Our derived relation $\\Delta \\tilde{t} / \\Delta \\tilde{x} = C$ shows that the numerical parameter $C$ directly represents the nondimensional ratio $\\Delta \\tilde{t} / \\Delta \\tilde{x}$. Therefore, the stability constraint for the advective part of the scheme simply becomes $C \\le C_{max}$.\n\nCrucially, this constraint is independent of the Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}$. This means that for any turbulent channel flow simulation using this scaling, the stability limit for advection is the same, regardless of the physical parameters $U$, $L$, and $\\nu$. This allows for a uniform, or standardized, assessment. For example, a statement like \"$C$ must be kept below $0.7$\" has a universal meaning for a given explicit scheme, irrespective of the flow's Reynolds number.\n\nIn contrast, if we had chosen the viscous time scale $t_0 = L^2/\\nu$, the nondimensional momentum equation would become:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial \\tilde{t}} + \\mathrm{Re} (\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\cdot\\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}) = -\\mathrm{Re} \\tilde{\\nabla} \\tilde{p} + \\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\n$$\nThe advective term is now multiplied by $\\mathrm{Re}$. The stability condition for advection would be $\\mathrm{Re} |\\tilde{u}| \\Delta \\tilde{t} / \\Delta \\tilde{x} \\le C_{max}$. This introduces a direct dependence on $\\mathrm{Re}$ into the stability criterion for $\\Delta \\tilde{t}$. The assessment would no longer be standardized, as the maximum allowable $\\Delta \\tilde{t}$ for a given $\\Delta \\tilde{x}$ would change with $\\mathrm{Re}$.\n\nTherefore, choosing $t_0 = L/U$ is the standard and logical choice for advection-dominated flows like turbulence, as it isolates the physical parameter dependence ($\\mathrm{Re}$) to the viscous term and allows for a uniform stability analysis of the advective term.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C \\, (\\Delta x / L)$, and choosing $t_0 = L/U$ ties the nondimensional time to the advective transport over the characteristic length, isolating stability to the advective constraint governed by $C$ and avoiding Reynolds-number dependence in the time scaling, thereby enabling uniform comparisons across meshes and flow conditions.**\n- The formula $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C \\, (\\Delta x / L)$ is correct, as derived in Part 2.\n- The justification is entirely correct. It correctly identifies that $t_0 = L/U$ is the advective time scale, that this choice makes the advective stability constraint independent of $\\mathrm{Re}$, and that this outcome facilitates standardized comparisons.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C$, and choosing $t_0 = L/U$ is arbitrary since the CFL number already measures stability; the particular time scale choice does not affect standardization.**\n- The formula $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C$ is incorrect. It should be $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C \\Delta \\tilde{x} = C (\\Delta x/L)$.\n- The claim that the choice of $t_0$ is arbitrary and does not affect standardization is incorrect. As shown in the analysis, choosing a different time scale like the viscous one fundamentally changes the nondimensional equation and introduces $\\mathrm{Re}$-dependence into the advective stability condition.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C \\, (L / \\Delta x)$, and choosing $t_0 = L/U$ emphasizes viscous effects, making the CFL number irrelevant for stability in turbulent channel flow.**\n- The formula $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C \\, (L / \\Delta x)$ is incorrect. It is the inverse of the correct relationship.\n- The claim that choosing $t_0=L/U$ emphasizes viscous effects is incorrect. It normalizes the advective term, thereby emphasizing its importance relative to the viscous term (which is scaled by $1/\\mathrm{Re}$).\n- The claim that the CFL number is irrelevant is incorrect; it is the key parameter for advective stability.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C / \\mathrm{Re}$, and choosing $t_0 = L/U$ introduces an explicit Reynolds-number dependence into stability assessments, which varies across flows and thus hinders standardization.**\n- The formula $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C / \\mathrm{Re}$ is incorrect. Our derivation shows no $\\mathrm{Re}$ dependence.\n- The justification is the exact opposite of the truth. Choosing $t_0=L/U$ *removes* explicit $\\mathrm{Re}$-dependence from the advective stability criterion, thereby *enabling* standardization.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C \\, (\\Delta x / L)$, but choosing the viscous time scale $t_0 = L^2/\\nu$ better standardizes stability because viscous diffusion is universal across turbulent channel flows.**\n- The formula $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = C \\, (\\Delta x / L)$ is derived under the assumption that $t_0=L/U$. It is inconsistent to pair this formula with a justification based on $t_0 = L^2/\\nu$. If we assume $t_0 = L^2/\\nu$, the correct relationship is $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = (C/\\mathrm{Re})(\\Delta x / L)$. So the statement is self-contradictory.\n- The justification that the viscous time scale is better for standardization is incorrect for advection-dominated (high-$\\mathrm{Re}$) turbulent flows, where the advective time-step constraint is typically more restrictive.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3349912"}]}
