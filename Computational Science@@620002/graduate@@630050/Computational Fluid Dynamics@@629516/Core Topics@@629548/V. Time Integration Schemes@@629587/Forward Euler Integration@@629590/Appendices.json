The semi-discrete equation is $\\frac{du_j}{dt} = -a \\frac{u_{j+1} - u_{j-1}}{2\\Delta x}$.\nSubstituting the Fourier mode:\n$$ \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} e^{ij\\theta} = -\\frac{a}{2\\Delta x} (\\hat{u}e^{i(j+1)\\theta} - \\hat{u}e^{i(j-1)\\theta}) = -\\frac{a}{2\\Delta x} (e^{i\\theta} - e^{-i\\theta}) \\hat{u}e^{ij\\theta} = -\\frac{a}{\\Delta x} (i\\sin\\theta) \\hat{u}e^{ij\\theta} $$\nThe eigenvalue is $\\lambda(\\theta) = -\\frac{a}{\\Delta x}(i\\sin\\theta)$, so the symbol is:\n$$ \\Phi^{(2)}(\\theta) = i\\sin\\theta $$\nThe amplification factor is $G^{(2)}(\\theta) = 1 - \\nu(i\\sin\\theta) = 1 - i\\nu\\sin\\theta$.

Fifth-Order Linearized WENO Scheme\n\nThe semi-discrete operator is constructed from a left-biased reconstruction $u^-_{j+1/2}$ at the cell interface, which is a linear combination of three 3rd-order reconstructions from stencils $S_0=\\{j-2,j-1,j\\}$, $S_1=\\{j-1,j,j+1\\}$, and $S_2=\\{j,j+1,j+2\\}$. Using the standard linear weights $\\gamma_0=0.1, \\gamma_1=0.6, \\gamma_2=0.3$, the combined reconstruction is:\n$$ u^{-}_{j+1/2} = \\frac{1}{80}(3 u_{j-2} - 16 u_{j-1} + 60 u_j + 36 u_{j+1} - 3 u_{j+2}) $$\nThe semi-discrete operator for $-a u_x$ is $\\mathcal{L}_h u_j = -\\frac{a}{\\Delta x}(u^{-}_{j+1/2} - u^{-}_{j-1/2})$. This differencing results in a stencil for $\\mathcal{L}_h u_j$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_h u_j = - \\frac{a}{80 \\Delta x} [-3 u_{j-3} + 19 u_{j-2} - 76 u_{j-1} + 24 u_j + 39 u_{j+1} - 3 u_{j+2}] $$\nThe Fourier symbol $\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)$ of the operator $\\mathcal{L}_h / (-a/\\Delta x)$ is thus:\n$$ \\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{80}[-3e^{-3i\\theta} + 19e^{-2i\\theta} - 76e^{-i\\theta} + 24 + 39e^{i\\theta} - 3e^{2i\\theta}] $$\nTo analyze stability, we examine the small-$\\theta$ asymptotics of $\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)$. The real and imaginary parts are:\n$$ \\Re(\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)) = \\frac{1}{80}[-3\\cos(3\\theta) + 16\\cos(2\\theta) - 37\\cos\\theta + 24] $$\n$$ \\Im(\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)) = \\frac{1}{80}[3\\sin(3\\theta) - 22\\sin(2\\theta) + 115\\sin\\theta] $$\nTaylor expanding for small $\\theta$:\n$$ \\Im(\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)) = \\theta - \\frac{1}{24}\\theta^3 + O(\\theta^5) $$\n$$ \\Re(\\Phi^{(3)}(\\theta)) = -\\frac{1}{80}\\theta^4 + O(\\theta^6) $$\nThe stability condition $|1 - \\nu\\Phi|^2 \\le 1$ is equivalent to $2\\nu\\Re\\Phi - \\nu^2|\\Phi|^2 \\ge 0$. For $\\nu > 0$, this is $2\\Re\\Phi - \\nu|\\Phi|^2 \\ge 0$.\nUsing the small-$\\theta$ asymptotics:\n$$ 2(-\\frac{1}{80}\\theta^4) - \\nu(\\theta^2 + O(\\theta^4)) \\ge 0 $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{40}\\theta^4 - \\nu\\theta^2 + O(\\nu\\theta^4) \\ge 0 $$\nFor any $\\nu > 0$, there exists a small enough $\\theta_0$ such that for all $0 < |\\theta| < \\theta_0$, the left-hand side is negative, violating the stability condition. This occurs because the semi-discrete operator itself is unstable. Its eigenvalues are $\\lambda(\\theta) = -\\frac{a}{\\Delta x}\\Phi(\\theta)$, and for small $\\theta$, their real part is $\\Re(\\lambda(\\theta)) \\approx -\\frac{a}{\\Delta x}(-\\frac{1}{80}\\theta^4) = \\frac{a}{80\\Delta x}\\theta^4 > 0$. The spatial operator has growing modes. A time-stepping scheme like Forward Euler, whose stability region lies in the left half-plane, cannot stabilize an intrinsically unstable semi-discretization. Thus, this scheme is unconditionally unstable with Forward Euler for any $\\nu > 0$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe must find the tightest upper bound on $\\nu$ that ensures stability for all three discretizations simultaneously.
