For each case, compute the volume for two distinct reference points, and return the pair of volumes along with a boolean indicating whether the two volumes are equal within numerical tolerance (use absolute difference less than $10^{-10}$ for equality).

Use $\\mathbf{r}_{1}=(0.2,0.3,0.4)$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{2}=(-1,-1,-1)$.

The algorithm is based on decomposing the polyhedron's volume into a sum of signed volumes of tetrahedra formed by the vertices of each face and a common, arbitrary reference point. The core of the task is to prove that the resulting total volume is independent of the choice of this reference point for a closed, non-self-intersecting surface.\n\n### Algorithmic Design\n\nLet the polyhedron's volume be denoted by $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$, and its boundary surface by $\\partial \\Omega$. The boundary is a mesh composed of a set of $N$ triangular faces, $\\{f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_N\\}$. Each face $f_i$ is defined by an ordered triplet of vertices $(\\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{b}_i, \\mathbf{c}_i)$. The ordering is consistent across all faces, meaning the normal vector derived from the cross product, such as $(\\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{a}_i) \\times (\\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{a}_i)$, always points either into or out of the volume. By convention, we assume an outward-pointing normal orientation.\n\n1.  **Selection of a Reference Point**: We select an arbitrary reference point $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. This point can be anywhere in space, including inside, outside, or on the boundary of the polyhedron.\n\n2.  **Signed Volume of a Face-Based Tetrahedron**: For each triangular face $f_i$ with vertices $(\\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{b}_i, \\mathbf{c}_i)$, we form a tetrahedron with vertices $(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{b}_i, \\mathbf{c}_i)$. The signed volume of this tetrahedron, $V_i$, is given by the scalar triple product:\n    $$ V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\det\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_i - \\mathbf{r} & \\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{r} & \\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{r} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n    where the vectors are treated as columns of the matrix. This is equivalent to:\n    $$ V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{6} (\\mathbf{a}_i - \\mathbf{r}) \\cdot \\left( (\\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{r}) \\times (\\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{r}) \\right) $$\n    The sign of $V_i$ depends on the orientation of the face vertices $(\\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{b}_i, \\mathbf{c}_i)$ relative to the reference point $\\mathbf{r}$.\n\n3.  **Aggregation of Signed Volumes**: The total volume of the polyhedron, $V(\\mathbf{r})$, is computed by summing the signed volumes of all such tetrahedra:\n    $$ V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{6} \\det\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_i - \\mathbf{r} & \\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{r} & \\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{r} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n    If the surface normals (determined by the vertex ordering) point outwards, tetrahedra for which $\\mathbf{r}$ is on the \"inner\" side of the face will contribute positive volume, while those for which $\\mathbf{r}$ is on the \"outer\" side will contribute negative volume. For a convex polyhedron and an internal reference point, all contributions are positive. For a non-convex shape or an external reference point, cancellations occur, but the final sum correctly yields the net volume.\n\n### Proof of Independence from Reference Point $\\mathbf{r}$\n\nTo prove that the computed volume $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is independent of the choice of $\\mathbf{r}$ for a closed surface, we must show that the gradient of $V(\\mathbf{r})$ with respect to $\\mathbf{r}$ is the zero vector, i.e., $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nLet's compute the gradient of the contribution from a single face $f_i$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} \\det\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_i - \\mathbf{r} & \\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{r} & \\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{r} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nUsing the chain rule for the derivative of a determinant (Jacobi's formula) and noting that $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} (\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{r}) = -\\mathbf{I}$ (where $\\mathbf{k}$ is a constant vector and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor), the gradient of the determinant with respect to its vector arguments can be computed. A more direct method is to take the partial derivative with respect to a component of $\\mathbf{r}$, say $r_k$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_k} \\det[\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2, \\mathbf{u}_3] = \\det\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_1}{\\partial r_k}, \\mathbf{u}_2, \\mathbf{u}_3\\right] + \\det\\left[\\mathbf{u}_1, \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_2}{\\partial r_k}, \\mathbf{u}_3\\right] + \\det\\left[\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2, \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_3}{\\partial r_k}\\right] $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\mathbf{a}_i - \\mathbf{r}$, $\\mathbf{u}_2 = \\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{r}$, $\\mathbf{u}_3 = \\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{r}$. The partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_j}{\\partial r_k}$ is the vector $-\\mathbf{e}_k$, where $\\mathbf{e}_k$ is the standard basis vector for the $k$-th coordinate.\nThe $k$-th component of the gradient is thus:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V_i}{\\partial r_k} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\det[-\\mathbf{e}_k, \\mathbf{u}_2, \\mathbf{u}_3] + \\det[\\mathbf{u}_1, -\\mathbf{e}_k, \\mathbf{u}_3] + \\det[\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2, -\\mathbf{e}_k] \\right) $$\nUsing the scalar triple product identity, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V_i}{\\partial r_k} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( -\\mathbf{e}_k \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}_2 \\times \\mathbf{u}_3) - \\mathbf{e}_k \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}_3 \\times \\mathbf{u}_1) - \\mathbf{e}_k \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}_1 \\times \\mathbf{u}_2) \\right) $$\nAs this must hold for each component $k$, we can write the full gradient vector:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{6} \\left( (\\mathbf{u}_2 \\times \\mathbf{u}_3) + (\\mathbf{u}_3 \\times \\mathbf{u}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_1 \\times \\mathbf{u}_2) \\right) $$\nSubstituting back $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2, \\mathbf{u}_3$:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{6} \\left( ((\\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{r}) \\times (\\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{r})) + ((\\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{r}) \\times (\\mathbf{a}_i - \\mathbf{r})) + ((\\mathbf{a}_i - \\mathbf{r}) \\times (\\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{r})) \\right) $$\nThe sum of cross products inside the parenthesis can be simplified using the identity $(\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{u})\\times(\\mathbf{w}-\\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w}\\times\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v}$.\nLetting $\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{r}$, $\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{c}_i$, $\\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{b}_i$ and permuting terms, we find the sum is equivalent to $(\\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{a}_i) \\times (\\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{a}_i)$.\nTherefore:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{6} ((\\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{a}_i) \\times (\\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{a}_i)) $$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{b}_i - \\mathbf{a}_i) \\times (\\mathbf{c}_i - \\mathbf{a}_i)$ is the vector area, $\\mathbf{S}_i$, of the triangular face $f_i$. Thus:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\mathbf{S}_i $$\nThe gradient of the total volume is the sum of the gradients for each face:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{S}_i $$\nFor any closed surface $\\partial\\Omega$ (one that encloses a volume without any holes), the sum of the vector areas of all its faces is the zero vector: $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{S}_i = \\oint_{\\partial\\Omega} d\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{0}$. This is a consequence of the Divergence Theorem applied to a constant vector field.\nTherefore, for a closed surface:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThis proves that the calculated volume $V(\\mathbf{r})$ does not change with the position of the reference point $\\mathbf{r}$, establishing the robustness of the algorithm.\n\n### Failure of Independence for Open Surfaces\n\nThe proof of independence critically relies on the property that the sum of face area vectors over a **closed** surface is zero. If the surface is open, this condition is not met. The sum of the area vectors of an open surface is generally non-zero.\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i \\in \\text{open surface}} \\mathbf{S}_i \\neq \\mathbf{0} $$\nThis non-zero gradient implies that the computed \"volume\" $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is dependent on the choice of the reference point $\\mathbf{r}$.\n\n**Concrete Example (Case 4):**\nConsider a square patch in the $z=0$ plane defined by vertices $\\{(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(0,1,0)\\}$. Let it be triangulated into two triangles with upward orientation (normal in $+z$ direction):\n$f_1$ with vertices $(\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{c}_1) = ((0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0))$.\n$f_2$ with vertices $(\\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{b}_2, \\mathbf{c}_2) = ((0,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0))$.\n\nThe area vectors are:\n$\\mathbf{S}_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{b}_1 - \\mathbf{a}_1) \\times (\\mathbf{c}_1 - \\mathbf{a}_1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1,0,0) \\times (1,1,0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0,0,1)$.\n$\\mathbf{S}_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{b}_2 - \\mathbf{a}_2) \\times (\\mathbf{c}_2 - \\mathbf{a}_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(1,1,0) \\times (0,1,0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0,0,1)$.\n\nThe sum of the area vectors is $\\sum \\mathbf{S}_i = \\mathbf{S}_1 + \\mathbf{S}_2 = (0,0,1)$.\nThe gradient of the computed \"volume\" is $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} V(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{3}(0,0,1)$. This indicates that the value will change as the $z$-coordinate of $\\mathbf{r}$ changes.\nLet's compute $V(\\mathbf{r})$ for this surface. Note that for any face lying in the $xy$-plane, $\\det[\\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{b}_i, \\mathbf{c}_i]=0$.\nWe use the expansion $V_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{6} (\\det[\\mathbf{a}_i,\\mathbf{b}_i,\\mathbf{c}_i] - \\mathbf{r}\\cdot(2\\mathbf{S}_i))$.\nSo, $V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{6} (0 - \\mathbf{r}\\cdot(2\\mathbf{S}_i)) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\sum_i \\mathbf{S}_i$.\n$V(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{3} (r_x, r_y, r_z) \\cdot (0,0,1) = -\\frac{r_z}{3}$.\nFor the two reference points specified in Case 4:\n- $\\mathbf{r}_1 = (0,0,1)$: $V(\\mathbf{r}_1) = -1/3$.\n- $\\mathbf{r}_2 = (0,0,-1)$: $V(\\mathbf{r}_2) = -(-1)/3 = 1/3$.\nThe calculated values are different, confirming that the independence property fails for open surfaces.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the polyhedron volume problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def compute_volume(faces, ref_point):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the volume of a polyhedron defined by triangular faces.\n\n        Args:\n            faces (list of tuples): A list of triangular faces.

This practice provides a direct way to quantify the discretization error introduced into the diffusive flux calculation due to this non-orthogonality. Deriving this error term will give you a concrete appreciation for why high-quality, orthogonal meshes are sought after and provides the theoretical foundation for correction schemes used in virtually all modern CFD solvers.", "problem": "Two convex control volumes $P$ and $N$ in a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) discretization using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) share a single planar face $f$ of area $A_f$.

The cell centroids are at positions $\\boldsymbol{r}_P$ and $\\boldsymbol{r}_N$, with centroid-connecting vector $\\boldsymbol{d} = \\boldsymbol{r}_N - \\boldsymbol{r}_P$ and length $d = \\|\\boldsymbol{d}\\|$.

The problem statement provides two different two-point approximations for this flux.\n\nFirst, let us define the reference flux calculation, which the problem terms the \"exact two-point normal-difference representation\".

The error is directly proportional to the face area $A_f$. The influence of non-orthogonality is captured by the term $|\\sec\\theta_f - 1|$. In an orthogonal mesh where the centroid-connecting vector $\\boldsymbol{d}$ is aligned with the face normal $\\boldsymbol{n}_f$, the angle $\\theta_f = 0$. In this case, $\\cos\\theta_f = 1$ and $\\sec\\theta_f = 1$, which makes the error term zero, as expected since $d = d_n$. As the non-orthogonality increases and $\\theta_f$ deviates from $0$, the term $|\\sec\\theta_f - 1|$ grows, indicating an increase in the approximation error. The error becomes singular as $\\theta_f \\to \\pi/2$, where the reference flux denominator $d_n$ approaches zero.
