A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement: first, determining the similarity length scale $\\ell(x)$; second, deriving an expression for the boundary-layer thickness $\\delta_{99}(x)$; and third, calculating a numerical value for $\\delta_{99}$ using the provided data.\n\nFirst, we determine the functional form of the similarity length scale $\\ell(x)$. We start by expressing the velocity components $u$ and $v$ in terms of the stream function $\\psi(x,y)=\\sqrt{\\nu U_{\\infty} x}\\,f(\\eta)$, where $\\eta=y/\\ell(x)$.\n\nThe streamwise velocity component $u$ is given by:\n$$\nu = \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\sqrt{\\nu U_{\\infty} x}\\,f(\\eta) \\right) = \\sqrt{\\nu U_{\\infty} x} \\, \\frac{df}{d\\eta} \\frac{\\partial\\eta}{\\partial y}\n$$\nSince $\\eta = y/\\ell(x)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial\\eta}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{\\ell(x)}$. Thus,\n$$\nu = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu U_{\\infty} x}}{\\ell(x)} f'(\\eta)\n$$\nThe problem requires that the similarity-reduced equation be autonomous in $x$. A key step in achieving this is to simplify the velocity scaling. The free-stream boundary condition is $u(x,y) \\to U_{\\infty}$ as $y \\to \\infty$, which corresponds to $\\eta \\to \\infty$. The Blasius function boundary condition is $f'(\\eta) \\to 1$ as $\\eta \\to \\infty$. Applying these conditions to the expression for $u$ yields:\n$$\nU_{\\infty} = \\lim_{\\eta\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu U_{\\infty} x}}{\\ell(x)} f'(\\eta) \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu U_{\\infty} x}}{\\ell(x)} \\cdot 1\n$$\nThis directly imposes a constraint on $\\ell(x)$. To satisfy the boundary condition, the pre-factor must be equal to $U_{\\infty}$. Solving for $\\ell(x)$:\n$$\n\\ell(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu U_{\\infty} x}}{U_{\\infty}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}}\n$$\nThis establishes the functional dependence of the similarity length scale $\\ell(x)$ on $x$, $\\nu$, and $U_{\\infty}$. With this choice, the expression for $u$ simplifies to $u = U_{\\infty} f'(\\eta)$.\n\nTo be fully rigorous and confirm this choice using the autonomy argument, we could substitute the general forms into the momentum equation. The resulting ODE would have coefficients depending on $x$ and $\\ell(x)$. Requiring these coefficients to have a dependence on $x$ that cancels out would force $\\ell(x) \\propto \\sqrt{x}$. The boundary condition then fixes the constant of proportionality as derived above. This choice of $\\ell(x)$ leads to the Blasius equation $2f'''(\\eta) + f(\\eta)f''(\\eta) = 0$, which is autonomous in $x$.\n\nNext, we express the $99\\%$ boundary-layer thickness, $\\delta_{99}(x)$, in terms of the given parameters. By definition, $\\delta_{99}(x)$ is the value of $y$ at which the velocity $u$ reaches $99\\%$ of the free-stream velocity $U_{\\infty}$:\n$$\nu(x, y=\\delta_{99}(x)) = 0.99 \\, U_{\\infty}\n$$\nSubstituting our similarity expression for velocity, $u(x,y) = U_{\\infty} f'(\\eta)$:\n$$\nU_{\\infty} f'(\\eta_{\\delta_{99}}) = 0.99 \\, U_{\\infty}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta_{\\delta_{99}}$ is the value of $\\eta$ corresponding to $y=\\delta_{99}(x)$. This simplifies to $f'(\\eta_{\\delta_{99}}) = 0.99$. The problem defines $\\eta_{99}$ as precisely this value, so $\\eta_{\\delta_{99}} = \\eta_{99}$.\n\nFrom the definition of the similarity variable, $\\eta = y/\\ell(x)$, we have:\n$$\n\\eta_{99} = \\frac{\\delta_{99}(x)}{\\ell(x)}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta_{99}(x)$ gives:\n$$\n\\delta_{99}(x) = \\eta_{99} \\, \\ell(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $\\ell(x)$:\n$$\n\\delta_{99}(x) = \\eta_{99} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}}\n$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the boundary-layer thickness.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\delta_{99}$ at the specified location using the provided data: $\\nu=1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$, $x=0.20\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $U_{\\infty}=10.0\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, and $\\eta_{99}=4.910$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our expression for $\\delta_{99}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{99} = 4.910 \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}) \\times (0.20\\ \\mathrm{m})}{10.0\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{99} = 4.910 \\sqrt{\\frac{3.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^3/s}}{10.0\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{99} = 4.910 \\sqrt{3.0\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{99} = 4.910 \\times (5.4772255...) \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_{99} \\approx 0.0026893177...\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters.

I will now proceed with the solution derivation and the evaluation of the provided options.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe task is to solve the third-order boundary value problem for $f(\\eta)$:\n$$f''' + \\frac{1}{2} f f'' = 0$$\nsubject to the boundary conditions:\n$$f(0) = 0$$\n$$f'(0) = 0$$\n$$f'(\\eta \\to \\infty) = 1$$\nThis is a BVP because conditions are specified at two different points, $\\eta=0$ and $\\eta\\to\\infty$. The shooting method is an appropriate technique for solving this.\n\nThe core idea of the shooting method is to convert the BVP into an initial value problem (IVP) by guessing the missing initial conditions at one boundary, integrating to the other boundary, and then using an iterative root-finding algorithm to adjust the initial guess until the conditions at the second boundary are met.\n\nFor this third-order ODE, we need three initial conditions at $\\eta=0$. We are given $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=0$. The missing condition is $f''(0)$. We introduce a shooting parameter, $s$, for this unknown value:\n$$f''(0) = s$$\n\nWith these three conditions, we can formulate an IVP. It is standard practice to convert the third-order ODE into a system of three first-order ODEs. Let $y_1 = f$, $y_2 = f'$, and $y_3 = f''$. The system is:\n$$y_1' = \\frac{dy_1}{d\\eta} = f' = y_2$$\n$$y_2' = \\frac{dy_2}{d\\eta} = f'' = y_3$$\n$$y_3' = \\frac{dy_3}{d\\eta} = f''' = -\\frac{1}{2} f f'' = -\\frac{1}{2} y_1 y_3$$\nThe initial conditions for this system at $\\eta=0$ are:\n$$y_1(0) = f(0) = 0$$\n$$y_2(0) = f'(0) = 0$$\n$$y_3(0) = f''(0) = s$$\n\nThe shooting procedure is as follows:\n1.  Choose an initial guess for $s$.\n2.  Solve the IVP system from $\\eta=0$ to a sufficiently large but finite value $\\eta_{\\infty}$, which approximates the infinite domain. The solution depends on the choice of $s$, so we can write it as $y_2(\\eta_{\\infty}; s)$.\n3.  The condition that must be satisfied at the far-field boundary is $f'(\\eta\\to\\infty)=1$, which translates to $y_2(\\eta_{\\infty})=1$.\n4.  Define a residual function, $R(s)$, representing the error in satisfying this condition:\n    $$R(s) = y_2(\\eta_{\\infty}; s) - 1$$\n5.  The problem now is to find the root of $R(s)=0$. This can be done using a numerical root-finding algorithm, such as the secant method or Newton's method, which iteratively updates the guess for $s$ until $|R(s)|$ is smaller than a prescribed tolerance $\\varepsilon$.\n\nNow, let us evaluate each option based on this correct procedure.\n\n**Option A:**\nThis option correctly outlines the procedure described above.\n*   It correctly converts the Blasius ODE into the first-order system: $y_{1}'=y_{2}$, $y_{2}'=y_{3}$, $y_{3}'= -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,y_{1}\\,y_{3}$.\n*   It correctly states the initial conditions for the IVP: $y_{1}(0)=0$, $y_{2}(0)=0$, and $y_{3}(0)=s$.\n*   It proposes integrating to a large $\\eta_{\\infty}$ (e.g., $8$ to $12$), which is an appropriate range for the Blasius solution to have converged to its asymptotic state. It correctly recommends an adaptive ODE solver with error control, which is the best practice for ensuring accuracy and efficiency.\n*   It defines the correct residual function $R(s)=y_{2}(\\eta_{\\infty};s)-1$, which directly measures the mismatch with the required far-field boundary condition.\n*   It suggests appropriate root-finding algorithms (secant or Newton). For the Newton method, it provides the correct formulation of the sensitivity (or variational) equations needed to compute the derivative $\\mathrm{d}R/\\mathrm{d}s$. The derivation of the sensitivity equations for $w_i = \\partial y_i/\\partial s$ and their initial conditions is perfectly accurate. This demonstrates a high level of computational expertise.\n*   Finally, it includes the check that $y_3(\\eta) \\to 0$ for large $\\eta$ as a verification of the choice of $\\eta_{\\infty}$, which is a sound practice. If $y_2(\\eta) \\to 1$, its derivative $y_3(\\eta)$ must approach $0$.\nThis option describes a complete, correct, robust, and sophisticated numerical shooting strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:**\nThis option proposes a backward integration from $\\eta=\\eta_{\\infty}$ to $\\eta=0$.\n*   The shooting parameter here is $f(\\eta_{\\infty})$, with $f'(\\eta_{\\infty}) = 1$ and $f''(\\eta_{\\infty}) = 0$ assumed as starting conditions. The goal is to satisfy the two conditions at the wall, $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=0$.\n*   The fundamental flaw in this approach is numerical instability. The Blasius equation, when integrated backward in $\\eta$, exhibits exponential growth of errors. A small perturbation in the initial guess for $f(\\eta_{\\infty})$ will be greatly amplified by the time the integration reaches $\\eta=0$. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a converged and accurate solution. Forward integration from $\\eta=0$ is the stable direction.\n*   Additionally, it suggests a fixed-step ODE solver, which is generally inferior to an adaptive solver for problems of this nature.\nThis strategy is not computationally sound or robust.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:**\nThis option proposes a forward integration, which is correct, but uses a flawed residual function.\n*   The residual is defined as $R(s) = f(\\eta_{\\infty};s) - \\eta_{\\infty}$.\n*   This is based on the incorrect assumption that $f(\\eta) \\to \\eta$ as $\\eta \\to \\infty$. The correct asymptotic behavior of the Blasius solution is $f(\\eta) \\sim \\eta - \\beta$ for large $\\eta$, where $\\beta \\approx 1.7207$ is a constant related to the displacement thickness. The value of $\\beta$ is not known *a priori*; it is a result of the solution.\n*   Targeting $f(\\eta_{\\infty}) = \\eta_{\\infty}$ will lead to an incorrect solution because it ignores the non-zero asymptotic displacement of the streamfunction. The shooting method must enforce the actual boundary condition given in the problem, which is $f'(\\eta\\to\\infty)=1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:**\nThis option also proposes forward integration but uses another flawed residual function.\n*   The residual is defined as $R(s) = y_{3}(\\eta_{\\infty};s) = f''(\\eta_{\\infty};s)$. The goal is to drive this residual to $0$.\n*   While it is true that for the correct solution, $f''(\\eta \\to \\infty) = 0$, this condition is not sufficient to determine the correct value of $s$. For any positive initial guess $s=f''(0)>0$, the resulting velocity profile $f'(\\eta)$ will be monotonically increasing and concave, eventually approaching some constant value $C$. As soon as $f'(\\eta)$ approaches any constant, its derivative, $f''(\\eta)$, must approach $0$.\n*   Therefore, the condition $f''(\\eta_{\\infty})=0$ will be satisfied for a wide range of $s$ values, each leading to a different asymptotic velocity $f'(\\eta\\to\\infty)=C$. The function $R(s) = f''(\\eta_\\infty; s)$ will be very close to $0$ for all valid $s$, making it impossible for a root-finder to select the unique $s$ that yields $C=1$. The condition is necessary but not sufficient, leading to an ill-posed root-finding problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3319247"}]}
