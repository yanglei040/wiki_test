A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of $u_{\\infty}$ and $C$\nWe start from the supplied asymptotic error model, neglecting the higher-order terms as the problem assumes we are in the asymptotic regime:\n$$u_{h} \\approx u_{\\infty} + C h^{p}$$\nWe can write this equation for the two grids, with representative mesh spacings $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$:\n$$u_{h_{1}} = u_{\\infty} + C h_{1}^{p} \\quad (1)$$\n$$u_{h_{2}} = u_{\\infty} + C h_{2}^{p} \\quad (2)$$\nThe grid refinement ratio is given as $r = h_{2} / h_{1}$, which implies $h_{2} = r h_{1}$. Substituting this into equation $(2)$:\n$$u_{h_{2}} = u_{\\infty} + C (r h_{1})^{p} = u_{\\infty} + C r^{p} h_{1}^{p} \\quad (3)$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations, $(1)$ and $(3)$, for the two unknowns $u_{\\infty}$ and $C$.\n\nTo find $u_{\\infty}$, we eliminate $C$. Multiply equation $(1)$ by $r^{p}$:\n$$r^{p} u_{h_{1}} = r^{p} u_{\\infty} + r^{p} C h_{1}^{p}$$\nSubtracting equation $(3)$ from this result gives:\n$$r^{p} u_{h_{1}} - u_{h_{2}} = (r^{p} u_{\\infty} - u_{\\infty}) + (r^{p} C h_{1}^{p} - r^{p} C h_{1}^{p})$$\n$$r^{p} u_{h_{1}} - u_{h_{2}} = u_{\\infty} (r^{p} - 1)$$\nSolving for $u_{\\infty}$ yields the Richardson extrapolation formula:\n$$u_{\\infty} = \\frac{r^{p} u_{h_{1}} - u_{h_{2}}}{r^{p} - 1}$$\nThis can also be written in the common form $u_{\\infty} = u_{h_{1}} + \\frac{u_{h_{1}} - u_{h_{2}}}{r^{p} - 1}$.\n\nTo find $C$, we eliminate $u_{\\infty}$. Subtracting equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$u_{h_{2}} - u_{h_{1}} = (u_{\\infty} - u_{\\infty}) + (C h_{2}^{p} - C h_{1}^{p})$$\nUsing $h_{2} = r h_{1}$, we get:\n$$u_{h_{2}} - u_{h_{1}} = C ( (r h_{1})^{p} - h_{1}^{p} ) = C h_{1}^{p} (r^{p} - 1)$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{u_{h_{2}} - u_{h_{1}}}{h_{1}^{p} (r^{p} - 1)}$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expressions. The givens are $u_{h_{1}} = 0.9970$, $u_{h_{2}} = 0.9920$, $r = 2$, $p = 2$, and $h_{1} = 1$.\n\nEvaluation of $u_{\\infty}$:\n$$u_{\\infty} = \\frac{r^{p} u_{h_{1}} - u_{h_{2}}}{r^{p} - 1} = \\frac{2^{2} \\times 0.9970 - 0.9920}{2^{2} - 1}$$\n$$u_{\\infty} = \\frac{4 \\times 0.9970 - 0.9920}{4 - 1} = \\frac{3.9880 - 0.9920}{3}$$\n$$u_{\\infty} = \\frac{2.9960}{3} = 0.998666...$$\nRounding to six significant figures, we get $u_{\\infty} = 0.998667$.\n\nEvaluation of $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{u_{h_{2}} - u_{h_{1}}}{h_{1}^{p} (r^{p} - 1)} = \\frac{0.9920 - 0.9970}{1^{2} (2^{2} - 1)}$$\n$$C = \\frac{-0.0050}{1 \\times (4 - 1)} = \\frac{-0.0050}{3}$$\n$$C = -0.001666...$$\nRounding to six significant figures, we get $C = -0.00166667$.\n\n### Interpretation of the Sign of $C$\nThe discretization error of the numerical solution $u_{h}$ is defined as $E_{h} = u_{h} - u_{\\infty}$. From the asymptotic model, this error is approximated by the leading term:\n$$E_{h} = u_{h} - u_{\\infty} \\approx C h^{p}$$\nSince the grid spacing $h$ is a positive quantity, $h^{p}$ is also positive for any order $p$. Thus, the sign of the error $E_{h}$ is determined by the sign of the leading error coefficient $C$.\n\nIn this problem, we calculated $C \\approx -0.00166667$, which is a negative value. A negative $C$ implies that the error $E_{h} = u_{h} - u_{\\infty}$ is negative.\n$$u_{h} - u_{\\infty} < 0 \\implies u_{h} < u_{\\infty}$$\nThis means that the sequence of numerical solutions $u_{h}$ obtained from refining the grid will approach the exact continuum value $u_{\\infty}$ from below. This is known as monotonic convergence from below. This conclusion is consistent with the given data: the solution on the coarser grid, $u_{h_{2}} = 0.9920$, is less than the solution on the finer grid, $u_{h_{1}} = 0.9970$, and both are less than the extrapolated continuum value, $u_{\\infty} \\approx 0.998667$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.998667 & -0.00166667\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3358975"}, {"introduction": "While two-grid studies are informative, a three-grid study provides a more powerful analysis by allowing you to calculate the *observed* order of accuracy, $p$.

Assuming the solution is in the asymptotic range, the error is dominated by the leading term, and we can write the relationship between the numerical solution on a grid of size $h$, $u_h$, and the exact (or grid-independent) solution, $u_{\\infty}$, as:\n$$u_h - u_{\\infty} \\approx C h^p$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant that depends on higher-order derivatives of the solution but is independent of $h$, and $p$ is the formal order of accuracy of the numerical method.\n\nWe are given three solutions on grids with characteristic sizes $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h_3$. The grids are uniformly refined, so the grid spacing is related by a constant refinement ratio, $r$. We have $h_1 > h_2 > h_3$ with $h_1 = r h_2$ and $h_2 = r h_3$. The given value for the refinement ratio is $r=1.5$. The corresponding solutions are $u_{h_1}=2.0015$, $u_{h_2}=1.9990$, and $u_{h_3}=1.9982$.\n\nWe can write the error equation for each of the three grids:\n$$u_{h_1} - u_{\\infty} \\approx C h_1^p \\quad (1)$$\n$$u_{h_2} - u_{\\infty} \\approx C h_2^p \\quad (2)$$\n$$u_{h_3} - u_{\\infty} \\approx C h_3^p \\quad (3)$$\n\nTo determine the observed order of accuracy $p$, we can eliminate the unknown constants $C$ and $u_{\\infty}$. We first subtract the equations pairwise to eliminate $u_{\\infty}$:\n$$u_{h_1} - u_{h_2} = (u_{h_1} - u_{\\infty}) - (u_{h_2} - u_{\\infty}) \\approx C(h_1^p - h_2^p)$$\n$$u_{h_2} - u_{h_3} = (u_{h_2} - u_{\\infty}) - (u_{h_3} - u_{\\infty}) \\approx C(h_2^p - h_3^p)$$\n\nUsing the relationship between the grid spacings, $h_1 = r h_2$ and $h_2 = r h_3$, we can rewrite these differences:\n$$u_{h_1} - u_{h_2} \\approx C((rh_2)^p - h_2^p) = C h_2^p (r^p - 1)$$\n$$u_{h_2} - u_{h_3} \\approx C((rh_3)^p - h_3^p) = C h_3^p (r^p - 1)$$\n\nNow, we take the ratio of these two differences to eliminate $C$ and the term $(r^p - 1)$:\n$$\\frac{u_{h_1} - u_{h_2}}{u_{h_2} - u_{h_3}} \\approx \\frac{C h_2^p (r^p - 1)}{C h_3^p (r^p - 1)} = \\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_3}\\right)^p = r^p$$\n\nThis provides a direct formula for the observed order of accuracy, $p$, based on the three solutions:\n$$p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{u_{h_1} - u_{h_2}}{u_{h_2} - u_{h_3}}\\right)}{\\ln(r)}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$u_{h_1} - u_{h_2} = 2.0015 - 1.9990 = 0.0025$$\n$$u_{h_2} - u_{h_3} = 1.9990 - 1.9982 = 0.0008$$\n$$r = 1.5$$\n\nThe ratio of the differences is $\\frac{0.0025}{0.0008} = 3.125$.\nTherefore, the observed order of accuracy is:\n$$p = \\frac{\\ln(3.125)}{\\ln(1.5)} \\approx \\frac{1.139434}{0.405465} \\approx 2.80999$$\n\nNext, we perform Richardson extrapolation to estimate the grid-independent value $u_{\\infty}$. The extrapolation is typically based on the two finest grids (in this case, $h_2$ and $h_3$) as they are expected to be deeper in the asymptotic range. We start with equations (2) and (3):\n$$u_{h_2} - u_{\\infty} \\approx C h_2^p$$\n$$u_{h_3} - u_{\\infty} \\approx C h_3^p = C \\left(\\frac{h_2}{r}\\right)^p = \\frac{1}{r^p} (C h_2^p)$$\nSubstituting the first expression into the second gives:\n$$u_{h_3} - u_{\\infty} \\approx \\frac{1}{r^p} (u_{h_2} - u_{\\infty})$$\n$$r^p(u_{h_3} - u_{\\infty}) \\approx u_{h_2} - u_{\\infty}$$\n$$r^p u_{h_3} - r^p u_{\\infty} \\approx u_{h_2} - u_{\\infty}$$\n$$(r^p - 1) u_{\\infty} \\approx r^p u_{h_3} - u_{h_2}$$\n$$u_{\\infty} \\approx \\frac{r^p u_{h_3} - u_{h_2}}{r^p - 1}$$\nThis formula can be rearranged for practical calculation as:\n$$u_{\\infty} \\approx u_{h_3} + \\frac{u_{h_3} - u_{h_2}}{r^p - 1}$$\nWe have already calculated all the necessary terms. The value of $r^p$ is precisely the ratio of differences we found earlier:\n$$r^p = \\frac{u_{h_1} - u_{h_2}}{u_{h_2} - u_{h_3}} = 3.125$$\nThe difference between the fine and medium grid solutions is $u_{h_3} - u_{h_2} = 1.9982 - 1.9990 = -0.0008$.\nNow, we can compute the extrapolated value $u_{\\infty}$:\n$$u_{\\infty} \\approx 1.9982 + \\frac{-0.0008}{3.125 - 1} = 1.9982 - \\frac{0.0008}{2.125}$$\n$$u_{\\infty} \\approx 1.9982 - 0.000376470588...$$\n$$u_{\\infty} \\approx 1.997823529...$$\nRounding to six significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$u_{\\infty} \\approx 1.99782$$\n\nRegarding the reliability of this estimate, the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) methodology provides a framework for assessing uncertainty. A key step is to determine if the solution is in the asymptotic range. The a priori condition for convergence is that the solution changes monotonically with grid refinement, which is observed here since $|u_{h_1}-u_{h_2}| = 0.0025 > |u_{h_2}-u_{h_3}| = 0.0008$. The core of the analysis rests on the assumption that a single error term $Ch^p$ is dominant. The consistency of this assumption is checked by comparing the observed order of accuracy, $p$, to the theoretical order of the scheme. For typical finite-volume methods, one might expect an integer order like $p=2$. Our calculated observed order is $p \\approx 2.81$. This value is not close to an integer, which could imply that the grids are not yet fine enough to be in the asymptotic range, and higher-order error terms are still significant. The GCI methodology uses the observed $p$ to estimate an error band, but the confidence in this band is weakened when $p$ deviates significantly from the expected theoretical order. Thus, while the calculation is formally correct and consistent with the provided data, the deviation of the observed order from an expected integer value casts some doubt on the reliability of the extrapolated value. The estimate should be treated with caution, as the fundamental assumption of asymptotic convergence may not be fully satisfied.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.99782}$$", "id": "3359001"}, {"introduction": "Beyond finding an extrapolated 'exact' value, a critical part of verification is quantifying the numerical uncertainty in your best available result.
