It is based on the established Kolmogorov similarity hypothesis in the field of turbulence theory and requests a standard derivation using dimensional analysis, followed by a conceptual explanation of its application in computational fluid dynamics. The problem provides all necessary information and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts. First, we derive the expressions for the Kolmogorov scales using dimensional analysis. Second, we explain the role of these scales in scale-adaptive simulation (SAS) strategies. Third, we discuss the implications of the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Kolmogorov Scales**\n\nAccording to the Kolmogorov similarity hypothesis, the smallest scales of turbulent motion are determined solely by the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the mean rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation per unit mass, $\\epsilon$. We use dimensional analysis to find the expressions for the length, time, and velocity scales.\n\nThe dimensions of the governing parameters in terms of length ($L$), time ($T$), and mass ($M$) are:\n- Kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$: The SI units are $m^2/s$. The dimensions are $[\\nu] = L^2 T^{-1}$.\n- Dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$: The SI units are $m^2/s^3$ (energy per unit mass per unit time, where energy is $ML^2T^{-2}$). The dimensions are $[\\epsilon] = L^2 T^{-3}$.\n\n**Kolmogorov Length Scale ($\\eta$)**\nWe assume the length scale $\\eta$ is a function of $\\nu$ and $\\epsilon$ of the form $\\eta = C \\nu^a \\epsilon^b$, where $C$ is a dimensionless constant (which we set to $1$ per the problem statement), and $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined.\nThe dimensions of $\\eta$ must be length, $[L]$.\n$$[\\eta] = [\\nu]^a [\\epsilon]^b$$\n$$L^1 T^0 = (L^2 T^{-1})^a (L^2 T^{-3})^b$$\n$$L^1 T^0 = L^{2a} T^{-a} L^{2b} T^{-3b}$$\n$$L^1 T^0 = L^{2a+2b} T^{-a-3b}$$\nEquating the exponents for each dimension:\n1. For dimension $L$: $2a + 2b = 1$\n2. For dimension $T$: $-a - 3b = 0 \\implies a = -3b$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $a$ from the second equation into the first:\n$$2(-3b) + 2b = 1$$\n$$-6b + 2b = 1$$\n$$-4b = 1 \\implies b = -\\frac{1}{4}$$\nNow, find $a$:\n$$a = -3b = -3\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThus, the Kolmogorov length scale is $\\eta = \\nu^{3/4} \\epsilon^{-1/4}$, which can be written as:\n$$\\eta = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/4}$$\n\n**Kolmogorov Time Scale ($\\tau_{\\eta}$)**\nWe assume the time scale $\\tau_{\\eta}$ has the form $\\tau_{\\eta} = C \\nu^c \\epsilon^d$, with $C=1$.\nThe dimensions of $\\tau_{\\eta}$ must be time, $[T]$.\n$$[\\tau_{\\eta}] = [\\nu]^c [\\epsilon]^d$$\n$$L^0 T^1 = (L^2 T^{-1})^c (L^2 T^{-3})^d$$\n$$L^0 T^1 = L^{2c+2d} T^{-c-3d}$$\nEquating the exponents:\n1. For dimension $L$: $2c + 2d = 0 \\implies c = -d$\n2. For dimension $T$: $-c - 3d = 1$\n\nSubstitute $c = -d$ into the second equation:\n$$-(-d) - 3d = 1$$\n$$d - 3d = 1$$\n$$-2d = 1 \\implies d = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nNow, find $c$:\n$$c = -d = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, the Kolmogorov time scale is $\\tau_{\\eta} = \\nu^{1/2} \\epsilon^{-1/2}$, written as:\n$$\\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2}$$\n\n**Kolmogorov Velocity Scale ($u_{\\eta}$)**\nWe assume the velocity scale $u_{\\eta}$ has the form $u_{\\eta} = C \\nu^e \\epsilon^f$, with $C=1$.\nThe dimensions of $u_{\\eta}$ must be velocity, $[L T^{-1}]$.\n$$[u_{\\eta}] = [\\nu]^e [\\epsilon]^f$$\n$$L^1 T^{-1} = (L^2 T^{-1})^e (L^2 T^{-3})^f$$\n$$L^1 T^{-1} = L^{2e+2f} T^{-e-3f}$$\nEquating the exponents:\n1. For dimension $L$: $2e + 2f = 1$\n2. For dimension $T$: $-e - 3f = -1 \\implies e = 1 - 3f$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $e$ into the first equation:\n$$2(1 - 3f) + 2f = 1$$\n$$2 - 6f + 2f = 1$$\n$$2 - 4f = 1 \\implies 1 = 4f \\implies f = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nNow, find $e$:\n$$e = 1 - 3f = 1 - 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThus, the Kolmogorov velocity scale is $u_{\\eta} = \\nu^{1/4} \\epsilon^{1/4}$, written as:\n$$u_{\\eta} = (\\nu\\epsilon)^{1/4}$$\nAlternatively, the velocity scale can be derived from the length and time scales: $u_{\\eta} = \\eta / \\tau_{\\eta} = (\\nu^3/\\epsilon)^{1/4} / (\\nu/\\epsilon)^{1/2} = (\\nu^{3/4}\\epsilon^{-1/4}) / (\\nu^{1/2}\\epsilon^{-1/2}) = \\nu^{3/4-1/2}\\epsilon^{-1/4+1/2} = \\nu^{1/4}\\epsilon^{1/4}$, which confirms the result.\n\n**Part 2: Role in Scale-Adaptive Simulation Strategies**\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods for turbulence exist on a spectrum defined by the degree of scale resolution.\n- **Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)** resolves all scales of motion, from the largest energy-containing eddies down to the smallest dissipative scales. This requires a grid spacing $\\Delta x$ on the order of the Kolmogorov length scale, $\\Delta x \\lesssim \\eta$, and a time step $\\Delta t$ on the order of the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\Delta t \\lesssim \\tau_{\\eta}$. DNS is prohibitively expensive for most engineering flows.\n- **Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)** models all turbulent fluctuations and solves for the mean flow properties only. The mesh needs only to resolve the mean flow gradients, which is computationally inexpensive.\n- **Large Eddy Simulation (LES)** resolves the large, energy-containing eddies and models the effects of the smaller, supposedly more universal sub-grid scales (SGS). The grid size, or filter width, $\\Delta$, is in the inertial subrange, i.e., $\\eta \\ll \\Delta \\ll L$, where $L$ is the integral length scale of the turbulence.\n\n**Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS)** strategies, such as Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), are hybrid methods that aim to bridge the gap between RANS and LES. They use a RANS model in regions where the flow is attached and stable (e.g., near-wall boundary layers) and switch to an LES-like mode in regions with massive separation and unsteady, large-scale turbulent structures (e.g., wakes).\n\nThe Kolmogorov scales are fundamental in this context because they define the absolute finest resolution required for a complete description of the turbulent flow. In SAS, the modeling approach is often explicitly linked to the grid resolution. For instance, in DES, a length scale is used that transitions from a RANS-based scale to one proportional to the local grid size, $\\Delta$, once the grid becomes sufficiently fine. The decision to run in an \"LES mode\" is therefore a decision that the grid is fine enough to resolve a significant portion of the turbulent energy spectrum. The Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$, serves as the ultimate benchmark for this resolution. Knowing the local estimate of $\\eta$ (which can be obtained from $\\nu$ and an estimate of $\\epsilon$ from a preliminary RANS calculation) allows a user to assess if their grid in a particular region is fine enough for LES, approaching the demands of DNS, or only suitable for RANS. SAS methods are designed to function robustly across this range of resolutions, adapting their modeling based on the ratio of the grid spacing to the local turbulence length scales.\n\n**Part 3: Role of the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) Condition**\n\nThe CFL condition is a necessary stability criterion for explicit time-marching schemes used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations, including the Navier-Stokes equations. It states that the time step, $\\Delta t$, must be small enough such that information does not propagate across more than one computational cell in a single step. For an advection-diffusion problem, it takes the general form:\n$$\\Delta t \\le C_{max} \\min\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x}{|u|}, \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2\\nu}\\right)$$\nwhere $C_{max}$ is the maximum allowable Courant number (typically $\\approx 1$), $|u|$ is the characteristic velocity magnitude, and $\\Delta x$ is the grid spacing. The first term in the minimum is the advective constraint, and the second is the viscous diffusion constraint.\n\nThis condition creates a strong link between spatial and temporal resolution requirements.\n- In the RANS regions of an SAS simulation, $\\Delta x$ is large, and $|u|$ is the mean velocity. The time step can be relatively large.\n- In the LES regions of an SAS simulation, the grid is refined, so $\\Delta x$ is much smaller. The velocity $|u|$ now includes resolved turbulent fluctuations, which can be significantly larger than the mean velocity. Both factors force a drastic reduction in the stable time step $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe connection to Kolmogorov scales is most apparent when considering the limit of DNS. If the grid resolves the smallest eddies, then $\\Delta x \\approx \\eta$, and the relevant velocity and time scales are $u_{\\eta}$ and $\\tau_{\\eta}$.\n- The advective time step constraint becomes $\\Delta t \\lesssim \\frac{\\eta}{u_{\\eta}} = \\tau_{\\eta}$.\n- The viscous time step constraint becomes $\\Delta t \\lesssim \\frac{\\eta^2}{\\nu} = \\frac{(\\nu^3/\\epsilon)^{1/2}}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu^{3/2}\\epsilon^{-1/2}}{\\nu} = (\\nu/\\epsilon)^{1/2} = \\tau_{\\eta}$.\n\nThis demonstrates that for a fully resolved simulation, both the advective and diffusive time step limitations demand a time step on the order of the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$. Therefore, in an SAS simulation, as the model switches to an LES mode in a region of fine mesh, the CFL condition dictates that the time step must be refined accordingly to resolve the time evolution of the captured turbulent eddies, moving towards the stringent limit set by $\\tau_{\\eta}$. This highlights the computational cost increase associated with resolving smaller scales of turbulence.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/4} & \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2} & (\\nu\\epsilon)^{1/4} \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3360339"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, this problem addresses a core task in setting up a scale-adaptive simulation for wall-bounded turbulence: computational grid design.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Detailed Solution\n\nThe solution is determined in two parts: first, the calculation of the first-cell height, and second, the determination of the maximum allowable cell aspect ratios.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the first-cell height, $\\Delta y_{1}$**\n\nThe wall coordinate, $y^{+}$, is defined as the non-dimensional distance from the wall, normalized by the viscous length scale, $\\nu/u_{\\tau}$.\n$$y^{+} = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}$$\nwhere $y$ is the physical distance from the wall, $u_{\\tau}$ is the friction velocity, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe friction Reynolds number, $Re_{\\tau}$, is defined based on the channel half-height $\\delta$ and the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$.\n$$Re_{\\tau} = \\frac{\\delta u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}$$\n\nThe problem requires placing the centroid of the first off-wall cell at a physical distance $y_{1}$ from the wall such that its corresponding wall coordinate is $y_{1}^{+} = 50$. The problem asks for this physical distance, referring to it as the first-cell height $\\Delta y_{1}$. Therefore, we set $y_{1} = \\Delta y_{1}$ and $y_{1}^{+} = 50$.\n\nFrom the definition of $y^{+}$, we can express the physical distance $\\Delta y_{1}$ as:\n$$\\Delta y_{1} = \\frac{y_{1}^{+} \\nu}{u_{\\tau}}$$\nWe can rearrange the definition of $Re_{\\tau}$ to find the term $\\nu/u_{\\tau}$:\n$$\\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}} = \\frac{\\delta}{Re_{\\tau}}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta y_{1}$ yields:\n$$\\Delta y_{1} = y_{1}^{+} \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{Re_{\\tau}}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given values: $y_{1}^{+} = 50$, $\\delta = 0.05\\,\\text{m}$, and $Re_{\\tau} = 1000$.\n$$\\Delta y_{1} = 50 \\left(\\frac{0.05\\,\\text{m}}{1000}\\right) = 50 \\times 0.00005\\,\\text{m} = 0.0025\\,\\text{m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta y_{1} = 2.500 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the maximum allowable aspect ratios, $\\mathrm{AR}_{x,\\max}$ and $\\mathrm{AR}_{z,\\max}$**\n\nThe cell aspect ratios are defined as $\\mathrm{AR}_{x} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y}$ and $\\mathrm{AR}_{z} = \\frac{\\Delta z}{\\Delta y}$. The most stringent constraint on aspect ratio occurs in the near-wall region where $\\Delta y$ is smallest. Thus, we will use $\\Delta y = \\Delta y_{1}$ for our calculation.\n\nThe problem imposes two simultaneous constraints on the grid dimensions $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta z$:\n1.  An outer-layer resolution requirement to capture energy-containing eddies.\n2.  A numerical stability/robustness requirement on the maximum cell anisotropy.\n\nFirst, we determine the grid spacing required by the outer-layer resolution. The problem requires $N=10$ grid points per integral length scale in the streamwise ($x$) and spanwise ($z$) directions. This sets an upper limit on the permissible grid spacings $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta z$. To find the maximum allowable aspect ratio, we consider the largest permissible grid spacings.\n$$\\Delta x \\le \\frac{\\ell_{x}}{N} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta z \\le \\frac{\\ell_{z}}{N}$$\nThe integral length scales are given as $\\ell_{x} = 2\\delta$ and $\\ell_{z} = 1.5\\delta$.

This means:\n$$\\mathrm{AR}_{x} \\le \\Lambda = 50$$\n$$\\mathrm{AR}_{z} \\le \\Lambda = 50$$\n\nThe maximum allowable aspect ratios, $\\mathrm{AR}_{x,\\max}$ and $\\mathrm{AR}_{z,\\max}$, must satisfy both the resolution requirement and the anisotropy bound. Therefore, the maximum allowable value for each aspect ratio is the minimum of the value derived from the resolution constraint and the hard limit $\\Lambda$.\n\nFor the streamwise direction:\n$$\\mathrm{AR}_{x,\\max} = \\min(\\mathrm{AR}_{x, res}, \\Lambda) = \\min(4, 50) = 4$$\n\nFor the spanwise direction:\n$$\\mathrm{AR}_{z,\\max} = \\min(\\mathrm{AR}_{z, res}, \\Lambda) = \\min(3, 50) = 3$$\n\nThe resolution requirement is more restrictive than the numerical anisotropy limit in both directions.\n\nThe final answers, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- $\\Delta y_{1} = 2.500 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $\\mathrm{AR}_{x,\\max} = 4.000$\n- $\\mathrm{AR}_{z,\\max} = 3.000$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2.500 \\times 10^{-3} & 4.000 & 3.000\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3360351"}, {"introduction": "A key component of many scale-adaptive strategies is the wall model, which provides a closure for the near-wall physics that the grid does not resolve.

We must assess its validity in the presence of a strong adverse pressure gradient (APG), where $\\frac{dP}{dx} > 0$. The basis for this assessment is the mean streamwise momentum equation for a two-dimensional, thin turbulent boundary layer:\n$$ U\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} + V\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{dP}{dx} + \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\tau}{\\partial y} $$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the total shear stress (viscous plus Reynolds stress).\n\nThe log-law is derived under the \"constant stress layer\" assumption, which posits that in the region close to the wall (the inner layer), the total shear stress $\\tau$ is approximately constant and equal to the wall shear stress, $\\tau(y) \\approx \\tau_w$. This assumption holds when the effects of convection (left-hand side) and pressure gradient (first term on the right-hand side) are negligible compared to the shear stress gradient term.\n\nIn the presence of a non-zero pressure gradient, the momentum equation near the wall (where convective terms are small) simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tau}{\\partial y} \\approx \\frac{dP}{dx} $$\nIntegrating this from the wall ($y=0$, where $\\tau = \\tau_w$) to a distance $y$ gives:\n$$ \\tau(y) - \\tau_w \\approx \\int_0^y \\frac{dP}{dx} dy' $$\nSince $\\frac{dP}{dx}$ is independent of $y$ in a boundary layer, this becomes:\n$$ \\tau(y) \\approx \\tau_w + y \\frac{dP}{dx} $$\nThis result shows that the pressure gradient causes a linear deviation of the shear stress profile from the constant value $\\tau_w$. The fundamental assumption of the log-law, $\\tau(y) \\approx \\tau_w$, is therefore violated.\n\nTo quantify the impact on the wall model, we must compare the magnitude of the pressure gradient term to the wall shear stress term within the wall-model layer, i.e., for $0 \\le y \\le y_p$. The appropriate non-dimensional parameter is the ratio of the pressure force acting over this layer to the wall shear stress. Let us define this parameter, $\\Delta p^+$:\n$$ \\Delta p^+ = \\frac{y_p \\left| \\frac{dP}{dx} \\right|}{\\tau_w} $$\nThis parameter measures the relative importance of the pressure gradient.\n\nThe validity of the equilibrium wall-stress closure can be assessed as follows:\n1.  **Regime of Accuracy**: The closure is accurate when the pressure-gradient-induced stress variation is negligible compared to the wall shear stress itself. This occurs when $\\Delta p^+ \\ll 1$. In this regime, $\\tau(y) \\approx \\tau_w$ for $y \\in [0, y_p]$, the log-law is a valid representation of the velocity profile, and the derived expression for $\\tau_w$ is reliable. This corresponds to flows with zero or very mild pressure gradients.\n\n2.  **Regime of Breakdown**: The closure is expected to break down and become inaccurate when a strong adverse pressure gradient is present, such that $\\Delta p^+$ is of order one or larger ($\\Delta p^+ \\gtrsim 1$). In this case, the pressure gradient term is significant. For an APG ($\\frac{dP}{dx} > 0$), the total stress $\\tau(y)$ increases with $y$. The actual velocity profile $U(y)$ falls below the standard log-law curve. The wall model, which is ignorant of the pressure-gradient effect, will interpret the lower velocity $U_p$ at a given $y_p$ as evidence of a lower $\\tau_w$. Consequently, the equilibrium closure will systematically under-predict the true wall shear stress, potentially leading to a spurious prediction of flow separation.\n\nIn summary, the controlling non-dimensional parameter is $\\Delta p^+ = \\frac{y_p}{\\tau_w}|\\frac{dP}{dx}|$, and the derived equilibrium wall-stress closure is only valid for $\\Delta p^+ \\ll 1$. It fails in strong pressure gradients where this condition is not met.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\kappa U_p}{W\\left(\\frac{\\kappa U_p y_p}{\\nu} \\exp(\\kappa B)\\right)} \\right)^2} $$", "id": "3360418"}]}
