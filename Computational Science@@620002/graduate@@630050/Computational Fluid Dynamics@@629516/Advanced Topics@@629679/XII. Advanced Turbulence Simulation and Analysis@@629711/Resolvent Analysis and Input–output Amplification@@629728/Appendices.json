This practice introduces the essential numerical technique used to overcome this challenge: a matrix-free iterative algorithm. You will derive the power iteration method for finding the leading singular value, which relies only on repeated applications of the resolvent operator and its adjoint, demonstrating how large-scale input-output analysis is made practical [@problem_id:3357164].", "problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant input-output model obtained from the linearization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations around a steady base flow, in which the fluctuations obey $ \\frac{d q}{d t} = L q + B u $ and the measured output is $ y = C q $. Here $ q \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n} $ is the state vector, $ u \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m} $ is the input (forcing), $ y \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p} $ is the output (response), and $ L \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n} $, $ B \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times m} $, $ C \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p \\times n} $ are linear operators arising from spatial discretization.

All necessary information is provided, and the questions posed are standard derivations and calculations within the field of computational fluid dynamics and linear systems theory. The problem is valid.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. First, to derive a matrix-free iterative algorithm for the leading singular value of the frequency response operator $H(i\\omega)$ with respect to weighted inner products. Second, to compute an analytical expression for this singular value for a specific simple system.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Matrix-Free Iterative Algorithm\n\nThe leading singular value, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, of the operator $H(i\\omega) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p \\times m}$ is defined as its induced norm between the input space equipped with the inner product $\\langle u_{1}, u_{2} \\rangle_{u} = u_{1}^{*} W_{u} u_{2}$ and the output space with inner product $\\langle y_{1}, y_{2} \\rangle_{y} = y_{1}^{*} W_{y} y_{2}$. The norms are $||u||_u = \\sqrt{u^{*} W_{u} u}$ and $||y||_y = \\sqrt{y^{*} W_{y} y}$.\n\nThe squared leading singular value is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max}^2 = \\sup_{u \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m}, u \\neq 0} \\frac{||H(i\\omega)u||_y^2}{||u||_u^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of the norms, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max}^2 = \\sup_{u \\neq 0} \\frac{(H(i\\omega)u)^{*} W_{y} (H(i\\omega)u)}{u^{*} W_{u} u} = \\sup_{u \\neq 0} \\frac{u^{*} H(i\\omega)^{*} W_{y} H(i\\omega) u}{u^{*} W_{u} u}\n$$\nThis expression is a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The value $\\sigma_{\\max}^2$ is the largest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem:\n$$\nH(i\\omega)^{*} W_{y} H(i\\omega) u = \\lambda W_{u} u\n$$\nSince $W_{u}$ is Hermitian positive-definite, it is invertible. We can rearrange this into a standard eigenvalue problem:\n$$\n\\left( W_{u}^{-1} H(i\\omega)^{*} W_{y} H(i\\omega) \\right) u = \\lambda u\n$$\nThe operator whose dominant eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\sigma_{\\max}^2$ is therefore $G = W_{u}^{-1} H(i\\omega)^{*} W_{y} H(i\\omega)$.\n\nTo find the dominant eigenvalue $\\sigma_{\\max}^2$ and its corresponding eigenvector (the optimal forcing or right singular vector), we can use the power iteration method. This involves repeatedly applying the operator $G$ to an initial guess vector and normalizing at each step. The key is to perform this application without explicitly forming the matrices $H(i\\omega)$ or $G$.\n\nThe application of $G$ to a vector $u_{k}$ proceeds as follows: $\\tilde{u}_{k+1} = G u_{k} = W_{u}^{-1} H(i\\omega)^{*} W_{y} H(i\\omega) u_{k}$. Let's break this down into a sequence of matrix-free operations:\n1.  Apply $H(i\\omega)$: Compute $y_k = H(i\\omega) u_k = C (i\\omega I - L)^{-1} B u_k$. This is done by:\n    a.  Computing the intermediate vector $v_k = B u_k$.\n    b.  Solving the linear system $(i\\omega I - L) q_k = v_k$ for the state perturbation $q_k$.\n    c.  Computing the output $y_k = C q_k$.\n\n2.  Apply the output weight: Compute $z_k = W_y y_k$.\n\n3.  Apply the adjoint $H(i\\omega)^{*}$: Compute $w_k = H(i\\omega)^{*} z_k$. The adjoint is $H(i\\omega)^{*} = (C (i\\omega I - L)^{-1} B)^{*} = B^{*} ((i\\omega I - L)^{-1})^{*} C^{*} = B^{*} (-i\\omega I - L^{*})^{-1} C^{*}$. This application is done by:\n    a.  Computing the intermediate vector $v'_k = C^{*} z_k$.\n    b.  Solving the adjoint linear system $(-i\\omega I - L^{*}) q'_k = v'_k$ for the adjoint state $q'_k$.\n    c.  Computing the result $w_k = B^{*} q'_k$.\n\n4.  Apply the inverse input weight: Compute $\\tilde{u}_{k+1} = W_{u}^{-1} w_k$. This is done by solving the linear system $W_{u} \\tilde{u}_{k+1} = w_k$. Since $W_u$ is Hermitian positive-definite, this system can be solved efficiently (e.g., using a pre-computed Cholesky factorization).\n\nThe complete power iteration algorithm is:\n1.  Initialize with a random vector $u_0 \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m}$ such that $||u_0||_u = 1$.\n2.  For $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\n    a.  Compute $\\tilde{u}_{k+1} = G u_k$ using the matrix-free steps described above.\n    b.  The squared singular value is estimated using the Rayleigh quotient: $\\sigma_k^2 = \\frac{\\langle G u_k, u_k \\rangle_u}{\\langle u_k, u_k \\rangle_u} = \\frac{u_k^* W_u (W_u^{-1} H^* W_y H u_k)}{u_k^* W_u u_k} = \\frac{u_k^* H^* W_y H u_k}{u_k^* W_u u_k} = \\frac{(H u_k)^* W_y (H u_k)}{u_k^* W_u u_k} = \\frac{||y_k||_y^2}{||u_k||_u^2}$. If $||u_k||_u = 1$, then $\\sigma_k^2 = ||y_k||_y^2$.\n    c.  Normalize the vector for the next iteration: $u_{k+1} = \\frac{\\tilde{u}_{k+1}}{||\\tilde{u}_{k+1}||_u} = \\frac{\\tilde{u}_{k+1}}{\\sqrt{\\tilde{u}_{k+1}^{*} W_u \\tilde{u}_{k+1}}}$.\n3.  The sequence $\\sigma_k^2$ converges to $\\sigma_{\\max}^2$.\n\nThe inner-product weights $W_u$ and $W_y$ enter the iteration when applying the output weight (step 2), applying the inverse input weight (step 4), and in the normalization step (step 2c). They also define the Rayleigh quotient used to estimate the singular value (step 2b).\n\nPart 2: Analytic Calculation for a Specific Case\n\nFor the specific case, we are given $B=I$, $C=I$, $W_u=I$, $W_y=I$, and $L = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  1 \\\\ 1  -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The identity matrices imply that $n=m=p=2$.\n\nThe frequency response operator simplifies to $H(i\\omega) = C (i\\omega I - L)^{-1} B = (i\\omega I - L)^{-1}$.\nThe inner products are the standard Euclidean inner products, so the singular values of $H(i\\omega)$ are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix $H(i\\omega)^{*}H(i\\omega)$.\n\nFirst, we construct the matrix $A = i\\omega I - L$:\n$$\nA = i\\omega \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -2  1 \\\\ 1  -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} i\\omega+2  -1 \\\\ -1  i\\omega+2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe leading singular value of $H(i\\omega) = A^{-1}$ is related to the singular values of $A$ by $\\sigma_{\\max}(A^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\min}(A)}$. The singular values of $A$ are the square roots of the eigenvalues of $A^{*}A$.\n\nThe adjoint of $A$ is:\n$$\nA^{*} = \\begin{pmatrix} (i\\omega+2)^{*}  (-1)^{*} \\\\ (-1)^{*}  (i\\omega+2)^{*} \\end{pmatrix}^{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} -i\\omega+2  -1 \\\\ -1  -i\\omega+2 \\end{pmatrix}^{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} -i\\omega+2  -1 \\\\ -1  -i\\omega+2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the product $A^{*}A$:\n$$\nA^{*}A = \\begin{pmatrix} -i\\omega+2  -1 \\\\ -1  -i\\omega+2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} i\\omega+2  -1 \\\\ -1  i\\omega+2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA^{*}A = \\begin{pmatrix} (-i\\omega+2)(i\\omega+2) + (-1)(-1)  (-i\\omega+2)(-1) + (-1)(i\\omega+2) \\\\ (-1)(i\\omega+2) + (-i\\omega+2)(-1)  (-1)(-1) + (-i\\omega+2)(i\\omega+2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe diagonal entries are $(\\omega^2+4)+1 = \\omega^2+5$.\nThe off-diagonal entries are $(i\\omega-2)+(-i\\omega-2) = -4$.\nSo,\n$$\nA^{*}A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega^2+5  -4 \\\\ -4  \\omega^2+5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A^{*}A$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(A^{*}A - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega^2+5-\\lambda  -4 \\\\ -4  \\omega^2+5-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (\\omega^2+5-\\lambda)^2 - (-4)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\omega^2+5-\\lambda)^2 = 16\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^2+5-\\lambda = \\pm 4\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\omega^2+5 \\mp 4\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\omega^2+5+4 = \\omega^2+9$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\omega^2+5-4 = \\omega^2+1$. These are the squared singular values of $A$. The singular values of $A$ are $\\sigma_1(A) = \\sqrt{\\omega^2+9}$ and $\\sigma_2(A) = \\sqrt{\\omega^2+1}$.\n\nThe minimum singular value of $A$ is $\\sigma_{\\min}(A) = \\sqrt{\\omega^2+1}$ (since $\\omega^2 \\ge 0$).\nFinally, the leading singular value of $H(i\\omega)$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max}(H(i\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\min}(A)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2+1}}\n$$\nThis expression is a real and positive function for all real $\\omega$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2}+1}}}\n$$", "id": "3357164"}]}
