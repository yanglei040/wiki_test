A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) method is the modification of the destruction term in the underlying RANS transport equation. For the Spalart-Allmaras model, this involves replacing the length scale, which is the distance to the nearest wall $d$, with a new length scale $\\tilde{d}$. This new length scale is defined as:\n$$\n\\tilde{d} \\equiv \\min(d, C_{DES}\\Delta)\n$$\nwhere $d$ is the wall distance, $C_{DES}$ is a model constant, and $\\Delta$ is the characteristic local grid length scale.\n\nThe simulation operates in RANS mode when $d < C_{DES}\\Delta$, which makes $\\tilde{d} = d$. It switches to LES mode when $d > C_{DES}\\Delta$, which makes $\\tilde{d} = C_{DES}\\Delta$. The transition, or \"switching\" location, therefore occurs where the RANS length scale $d$ is equal to the LES length scale $C_{DES}\\Delta$. This is consistent with the problem's statement that \"the onset of the resolved-eddy mode occurs where the modeled wall-distance length equals the grid-limited length.\" The switching condition is thus:\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{sw}} = C_{DES}\\Delta\n$$\nThe problem states to assume that the local wall-distance $d$ is equal to the wall-normal coordinate $y$. Therefore, the switching location in the $y$ direction, $y_{\\mathrm{sw}}$, is given by:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{sw}} = C_{DES}\\Delta\n$$\nWe are asked to derive the switching locations for two different definitions of the grid length scale $\\Delta$.\n\n**Case 1: Grid length scale $\\Delta = \\Delta_{\\max}$**\nThe characteristic grid length is defined as $\\Delta = \\Delta_{\\max} = \\max(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z)$. The corresponding switching location, denoted as $y_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{(\\max)}$, is found by substituting this definition into the switching condition:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{(\\max)} = C_{DES}\\Delta_{\\max} = C_{DES} \\max(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z)\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Grid length scale $\\Delta = \\Delta_{\\mathrm{geo}}$**\nThe characteristic grid length is defined as the geometric mean $\\Delta = \\Delta_{\\mathrm{geo}} = (\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z)^{1/3}$. The corresponding switching location, denoted as $y_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{(\\mathrm{geo})}$, is found by substituting this definition into the switching condition:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{(\\mathrm{geo})} = C_{DES}\\Delta_{\\mathrm{geo}} = C_{DES}(\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z)^{1/3}\n$$\n\n**Comparison via the Ratio $\\eta$**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the dimensionless ratio $\\eta$ defined as:\n$$\n\\eta \\equiv \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{(\\max)}}{y_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{(\\mathrm{geo})}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived for $y_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{(\\max)}$ and $y_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{(\\mathrm{geo})}$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{C_{DES} \\max(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z)}{C_{DES}(\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z)^{1/3}}\n$$\nThe constant $C_{DES}$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This shows that the ratio of switching locations is independent of the specific value of the DES constant, and depends only on the grid cell dimensions.\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\max(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z)}{(\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z)^{1/3}}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for $\\eta$ in terms of the grid spacings $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta z$, as requested.

Using the Boussinesq hypothesis, the Reynolds stresses are modeled as $-\\langle u_i' u_j' \\rangle = 2\\nu_t S_{ij} - \\frac{2}{3}k\\delta_{ij}$. Substituting this into the production term gives:\n$$P_k = \\left(2\\nu_t S_{ij} - \\frac{2}{3}k_{\\mathrm{mod}}\\delta_{ij}\\right) S_{ij} = 2\\nu_t S_{ij}S_{ij} - \\frac{2}{3}k_{\\mathrm{mod}}S_{ii}$$\nFor an incompressible flow, $S_{ii} = \\nabla \\cdot \\langle \\mathbf{U} \\rangle = 0$. Thus, the production term simplifies to:\n$$P_k = 2\\nu_t S_{ij}S_{ij}$$\nThe problem defines the magnitude of the strain-rate tensor as $S \\equiv \\sqrt{2 S_{ij} S_{ij}}$, which implies $S^2 = 2 S_{ij}S_{ij}$. Therefore, the production term is:\n$$P_k = \\nu_t S^{2}$$\nNow, equating the simplified production and dissipation terms:\n$$\\nu_t S^{2} = \\beta^{*} k_{\\mathrm{mod}} \\omega$$\nThe problem also specifies using the eddy-viscosity relation $\\nu_t = k_{\\mathrm{mod}}/\\omega$, from which we can express the specific dissipation rate as $\\omega = k_{\\mathrm{mod}}/\\nu_t$. Substituting this into the equilibrium equation:\n$$\\nu_t S^{2} = \\beta^{*} k_{\\mathrm{mod}} \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{mod}}}{\\nu_t}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta^{*} k_{\\mathrm{mod}}^{2}}{\\nu_t}$$\nRearranging to solve for $k_{\\mathrm{mod}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{mod}}^{2} = \\frac{\\nu_t^{2} S^{2}}{\\beta^{*}}$$\nTaking the positive square root (since $k_{\\mathrm{mod}}$, $\\nu_t$, and $S$ are non-negative, and $\\beta^* > 0$), we obtain the proxy for the modeled turbulent kinetic energy:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y) = \\frac{\\nu_t(y) S(y)}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}}$$\n\n**Task 3: Insertion of Functional Forms**\n\nWe now substitute the given functional forms for the fields into the expressions for $k_{\\mathrm{res}}(y)$ and $k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y)$.\nFor $k_{\\mathrm{res}}(y)$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{res}}(y) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 2b) U_{r}^{2} A \\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\delta_{r}}\\right)$$\nFor $k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y)$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}} \\left[ \\nu_{t0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\ell}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\delta_{\\nu}}\\right) \\right] \\left[ S_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\delta_{s}}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y) = \\frac{\\nu_{t0} S_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\ell}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\delta_{\\nu}} - \\frac{y}{\\delta_{s}}\\right)$$\n\n**Task 4: Derivation of the Equilibrium Location, $y_{\\mathrm{eq}}$**\n\nWe need to find the location $y_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ where $k_{\\mathrm{res}}(y_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y_{\\mathrm{eq}})$, under the assumption that we are in the outer region where $y \\gg \\ell$. This allows the approximation $\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\ell}\\right)\\right) \\approx 1$.\nApplying this approximation to the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y)$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y) \\approx \\frac{\\nu_{t0} S_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}} \\exp\\left(-y\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta_{\\nu}} + \\frac{1}{\\delta_{s}}\\right)\\right)$$\nNow we set $k_{\\mathrm{res}}(y_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = k_{\\mathrm{mod}}(y_{\\mathrm{eq}})$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(1 + 2b) U_{r}^{2} A \\left(\\frac{y_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\delta}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\delta_{r}}\\right) = \\frac{\\nu_{t0} S_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{*}}} \\exp\\left(-y_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta_{\\nu}} + \\frac{1}{\\delta_{s}}\\right)\\right)$$\nTo solve for $y_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, we rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving $y_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.
