All provided information is self-contained and consistent. We proceed with a detailed solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct tasks related to the Cahn–Hilliard model. We will address them in sequence.\n\nFirst, we identify the stationary points of the bulk free-energy density $f(\\phi) = \\frac{W}{4}(\\phi^{2}-1)^{2}$ and classify them. Stationary points occur where the first derivative of the function with respect to $\\phi$ is zero. The first derivative is:\n$$\nf'(\\phi) = \\frac{d}{d\\phi} \\left[ \\frac{W}{4}(\\phi^2 - 1)^2 \\right] = \\frac{W}{4} \\cdot 2(\\phi^2-1) \\cdot (2\\phi) = W\\phi(\\phi^2-1) = W(\\phi^3-\\phi)\n$$\nSetting $f'(\\phi) = 0$ gives $W\\phi(\\phi^2-1) = 0$. Since $W>0$, the solutions are $\\phi=0$ and $\\phi^2-1=0$, which yields the three stationary points $\\phi = -1$, $\\phi = 0$, and $\\phi = 1$.\n\nTo determine the nature of these stationary points (minima, maxima, or saddle points), we use the second derivative test. The second derivative of $f(\\phi)$ is:\n$$\nf''(\\phi) = \\frac{d}{d\\phi} [W(\\phi^3-\\phi)] = W(3\\phi^2 - 1)\n$$\nWe evaluate $f''(\\phi)$ at each stationary point:\n- For $\\phi = 0$: $f''(0) = W(3(0)^2 - 1) = -W$. Since $W>0$, $f''(0) < 0$, which indicates that $\\phi=0$ is a local maximum of the bulk free-energy density.\n- For $\\phi = 1$: $f''(1) = W(3(1)^2 - 1) = 2W$. Since $W>0$, $f''(1) > 0$, which indicates that $\\phi=1$ is a local minimum.\n- For $\\phi = -1$: $f''(-1) = W(3(-1)^2 - 1) = 2W$. Since $W>0$, $f''(-1) > 0$, which indicates that $\\phi=-1$ is also a local minimum.\n\nThe two minima at $\\phi = \\pm 1$ represent the stable, equilibrium phases of the binary mixture, while the maximum at $\\phi = 0$ represents an unstable, mixed state.\n\nSecond, we are asked to evaluate $f''(\\phi)$ at $\\phi=\\pm 1$ and $\\phi=0$ and explain the implication for the stability of homogeneous states. As calculated above:\n- $f''(\\pm 1) = 2W$\n- $f''(0) = -W$\n\nThe stability of a homogeneous state $\\phi(x,t) = \\phi_0$ depends on the system's response to small perturbations. For a simple non-conserved gradient flow (like the Allen–Cahn equation), dynamics are described by $\\partial_t \\phi \\propto -\\mu$. Linearizing around a homogeneous state $\\phi_0$ (which is a stationary point of $f$, so $f'(\\phi_0)=0$) for a small, long-wavelength (spatially uniform) perturbation $\\delta\\phi$, we have $\\mu \\approx f''(\\phi_0)\\delta\\phi$. The linearized dynamics become $\\partial_t \\delta\\phi \\propto -f''(\\phi_0)\\delta\\phi$. The growth rate of the perturbation is thus proportional to $-f''(\\phi_0)$.\n- If $f''(\\phi_0) > 0$ (as for $\\phi_0 = \\pm 1$), the growth rate is negative, and small perturbations decay. The homogeneous state is stable. This corresponds to the system being in a stable equilibrium phase.\n- If $f''(\\phi_0) < 0$ (as for $\\phi_0 = 0$), the growth rate is positive, and small perturbations grow exponentially. The homogeneous state is unstable. This is the condition for spinodal decomposition, where an initially homogeneous mixture spontaneously separates into distinct phases.\n\nThird, we linearize the Cahn–Hilliard dynamics about the homogeneous state $\\phi_0=0$ and derive the dispersion relation. The Cahn–Hilliard equation is $\\partial_t \\phi = \\nabla \\cdot (M \\nabla \\mu)$, with the chemical potential given by the variational derivative $\\mu = \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{F}}{\\delta \\phi} = f'(\\phi) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 \\phi$.\nCombining these gives:\n$$\n\\partial_t\\phi = M\\nabla^2(f'(\\phi) - \\kappa \\nabla^2\\phi)\n$$\nWe linearize this equation around the homogeneous state $\\phi_0=0$ by considering a small perturbation $\\delta\\phi(x,t)$, such that $\\phi(x,t) = \\phi_0 + \\delta\\phi(x,t) = \\delta\\phi(x,t)$. We linearize the non-linear term $f'(\\phi)$ using a Taylor expansion around $\\phi_0=0$:\n$$\nf'(\\phi) \\approx f'(0) + f''(0)(\\phi-0)\n$$\nAs established, $f'(0)=0$ and $f''(0)=-W$. Thus, the linearized expression is $f'(\\delta\\phi) \\approx -W\\delta\\phi$.\nSubstituting this into the Cahn–Hilliard equation yields the linearized equation for the perturbation $\\delta\\phi$:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\delta\\phi = M\\nabla^2(-W\\delta\\phi - \\kappa\\nabla^2\\delta\\phi)\n$$\nIn one dimension, $\\nabla^2 = \\partial_x^2$, so:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\delta\\phi = -M W \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\delta\\phi - M\\kappa\\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial x^4}\\delta\\phi\n$$\nWe seek solutions in the form of Fourier modes, $\\delta\\phi(x,t) = \\hat{\\phi}_k \\exp(\\sigma(k)t + ikx)$, where $k$ is the wave number and $\\sigma(k)$ is the growth rate. Substituting this form into the linearized PDE, we replace temporal and spatial derivatives:\n$\\partial_t \\rightarrow \\sigma(k)$, $\\partial_x \\rightarrow ik$, $\\partial_x^2 \\rightarrow -k^2$, and $\\partial_x^4 \\rightarrow k^4$.\nThis yields an algebraic equation for $\\sigma(k)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(k)\\hat{\\phi}_k = -M W (-k^2)\\hat{\\phi}_k - M\\kappa (k^4)\\hat{\\phi}_k\n$$\nDividing by $\\hat{\\phi}_k$ (which is non-zero), we obtain the dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\sigma(k) = M W k^2 - M\\kappa k^4\n$$\nUnstable modes are those for which the growth rate is positive, $\\sigma(k)>0$. This occurs when $M W k^2 > M \\kappa k^4$, which simplifies to $k^2 < W/\\kappa$ for $k \\ne 0$.\n\nTo find the wave number $k_{\\max}$ of the fastest-growing unstable mode, we must find the value of $k$ that maximizes $\\sigma(k)$. We compute the derivative of $\\sigma(k)$ with respect to $k$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk}(M W k^2 - M\\kappa k^4) = 2MWk - 4M\\kappa k^3\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n2MWk - 4M\\kappa k^3 = 2Mk(W - 2\\kappa k^2) = 0\n$$\nThe non-trivial solution (for $k>0$) is $W - 2\\kappa k^2 = 0$, which gives:\n$$\nk^2 = \\frac{W}{2\\kappa}\n$$\nThe wave number of the fastest-growing mode is therefore:\n$$\nk_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{W}{2\\kappa}}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we check the sign of the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\sigma}{dk^2} = 2MW - 12M\\kappa k^2\n$$\nEvaluating at $k^2 = W/(2\\kappa)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\sigma}{dk^2}\\bigg|_{k=k_{\\max}} = 2MW - 12M\\kappa \\left(\\frac{W}{2\\kappa}\\right) = 2MW - 6MW = -4MW\n$$\nSince $M>0$ and $W>0$, the second derivative is negative, confirming that $k_{\\max}$ corresponds to a maximum growth rate.

The order parameter $\\phi$ is a function of $x$ only, i.e., $\\phi = \\phi(x)$. The gradient term becomes $|\\nabla \\phi|^2 = (d\\phi/dx)^2$.

This is a classic problem in the calculus of variations. The integrand is the Lagrangian $L(\\phi, \\phi')$, where $\\phi' = d\\phi/dx$:\n$$\nL(\\phi, \\phi') = \\frac{W}{4}(\\phi^2 - 1)^2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(\\phi')^2\n$$\nThe equilibrium profile must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi'}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} = 0\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi'} = \\kappa \\phi' \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi'}\\right) = \\kappa \\phi''\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{W}{4} \\cdot 2(\\phi^2-1) \\cdot 2\\phi = W\\phi(\\phi^2-1)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the equilibrium profile:\n$$\n\\kappa\\phi''(x) - W\\phi(x)(\\phi(x)^2 - 1) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this ODE with boundary conditions $\\phi(x \\to -\\infty) = -1$ and $\\phi(x \\to \\infty) = +1$, we multiply by $\\phi'$ and integrate with respect to $x$.

The given functional is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}[\\phi] = \\int_{V} \\left[ f(\\phi) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla \\phi|^2 \\right] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nWe expand the local free-energy density $f(\\phi)$ in a Taylor series around $\\phi_0$:\n$$\nf(\\phi) = f(\\phi_0 + \\delta\\phi) \\approx f(\\phi_0) + f'(\\phi_0)\\delta\\phi + \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\phi_0)(\\delta\\phi)^2\n$$\nFor a uniform equilibrium state, the first-order term vanishes upon integration over the volume, either because $f'(\\phi_0)=0$ (if $\\phi_0$ is an extremum of $f$) or due to mass conservation, which implies $\\int_V \\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = 0$. The gradient term becomes $|\\nabla \\phi|^2 = |\\nabla(\\phi_0 + \\delta\\phi)|^2 = |\\nabla\\delta\\phi|^2$, since $\\phi_0$ is constant.\nThe change in free energy, $\\Delta\\mathcal{F} = \\mathcal{F}[\\phi] - \\mathcal{F}[\\phi_0]$, relative to the uniform state is then approximated by:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathcal{F}[\\delta\\phi] \\approx \\int_{V} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\phi_0)(\\delta\\phi)^2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}|\\nabla\\delta\\phi|^2 \\right] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nThis is the Gaussian approximation to the free energy, valid for small fluctuations.\n\nNext, we express this free energy change in terms of the Fourier modes $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ of the fluctuation field $\\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$. The Fourier representation is given as:\n$$\n\\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nThe gradient in Fourier space is $\\nabla \\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} (i\\mathbf{k}) \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}}$. We use Parseval's theorem for Fourier series on a periodic domain of volume $V$, which states that for a function $g(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\int_V |g(\\mathbf{x})|^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} |\\hat{g}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2$.\nApplying this to the two terms in $\\Delta\\mathcal{F}$:\n1. For $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$, we have $\\hat{g}_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}$, so $\\int_V (\\delta\\phi)^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2$.\n2. For $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\nabla\\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$, the Fourier transform is $\\widehat{\\nabla\\delta\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}} = i\\mathbf{k} \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}$. Thus, $\\int_V |\\nabla\\delta\\phi|^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} |i\\mathbf{k} \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} |\\mathbf{k}|^2 |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} k^2 |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2$, where $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta\\mathcal{F}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathcal{F} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} f''(\\phi_0) \\left( \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 \\right) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} k^2 |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 \\right)\n$$\nCombining terms, the free energy simplifies to a sum over decoupled Fourier modes:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathcal{F} \\approx \\frac{1}{2V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\left( f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2 \\right) |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2\n$$\nIn thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, the probability of a given fluctuation configuration is proportional to the Boltzmann weight, $P \\propto \\exp[-\\Delta\\mathcal{F}/(k_B T)]$. The system's energy is expressed as a sum of quadratic terms in the modal amplitudes. We can therefore apply the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics.\n\nA real field $\\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ implies its Fourier coefficients satisfy the reality condition $\\hat{\\phi}_{-\\mathbf{k}} = \\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}^*$, where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. Let $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}} = u_{\\mathbf{k}} + i v_{\\mathbf{k}}$. This condition means $u_{-\\mathbf{k}} = u_{\\mathbf{k}}$ and $v_{-\\mathbf{k}} = -v_{\\mathbf{k}}$. For any generic wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ such that $\\mathbf{k} \\ne -\\mathbf{k}$, the variables $u_{\\mathbf{k}}$ and $v_{\\mathbf{k}}$ are independent real degrees of freedom. The energy contribution from the pair of modes $(\\mathbf{k}, -\\mathbf{k})$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathcal{F}_{(\\mathbf{k},-\\mathbf{k})} = \\frac{1}{2V} \\left( f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2 \\right) \\left( |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 + |\\hat{\\phi}_{-\\mathbf{k}}|^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2 \\right) |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2\n$$\nsince $|\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 = |\\hat{\\phi}_{-\\mathbf{k}}|^2$. This can be written in terms of the independent real variables as:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathcal{F}_{(\\mathbf{k},-\\mathbf{k})} = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2 \\right) ( u_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 + v_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 )\n$$\nThe equipartition theorem states that each independent quadratic degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$ to the average energy. We have two such degrees of freedom, $u_{\\mathbf{k}}$ and $v_{\\mathbf{k}}$.\nFor the $u_{\\mathbf{k}}$ degree of freedom:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{V} \\left( f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2 \\right) u_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T \\quad \\implies \\quad \\langle u_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{V k_B T}{2(f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2)}\n$$\nSimilarly, for the $v_{\\mathbf{k}}$ degree of freedom:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{V} \\left( f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2 \\right) v_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}k_B T \\quad \\implies \\quad \\langle v_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{V k_B T}{2(f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2)}\n$$\nThe desired equilibrium variance of the complex Fourier amplitude $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the sum of the variances of its real and imaginary parts:\n$$\n\\langle |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 \\rangle = \\langle (u_{\\mathbf{k}} + i v_{\\mathbf{k}})(u_{\\mathbf{k}} - i v_{\\mathbf{k}}) \\rangle = \\langle u_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 + v_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 \\rangle = \\langle u_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 \\rangle + \\langle v_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\langle |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{V k_B T}{2(f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2)} + \\frac{V k_B T}{2(f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2)} = \\frac{V k_B T}{f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2}\n$$\nThis result is valid for $\\mathbf{k} \\neq 0$. For a binary mixture, the total composition is conserved, meaning $\\int_V \\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = 0$. This implies that the $\\mathbf{k}=0$ mode, $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}=0}$, is identically zero.\n\nDiscussion of $M$ and $\\kappa k^2$:\nThe mobility $M$ is a kinetic parameter that appears in the Cahn-Hilliard dynamical equation, $\\partial_t \\phi = \\nabla \\cdot (M \\nabla (\\delta\\mathcal{F}/\\delta\\phi))$. It governs the rate at which the system approaches equilibrium but does not affect the properties of the equilibrium state itself. Equilibrium statistical properties, such as the variance $\\langle |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 \\rangle$, are determined solely by the free energy functional $\\mathcal{F}$ and the temperature $T$. Hence, $M$ does not appear in the final expression. This is a general principle: static equilibrium properties are independent of the system's dynamics.\n\nThe role of the term $\\kappa k^2$ is to regularize the fluctuations at small length scales (large wavevectors $k$). From the derived expression, we see that in the limit $k \\to \\infty$, the variance decays as $\\langle |\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 \\rangle \\sim 1/k^2$. This suppression is due to the energetic penalty $\\kappa |\\nabla \\phi|^2$ associated with sharp gradients in the phase field. Without this term (i.e., if $\\kappa=0$), the variance would be independent of $k$, leading to an \"ultraviolet divergence\" where the total fluctuation power, integrated over all modes, would be infinite. The $\\kappa k^2$ term ensures that fluctuations are smoothly varying at a microscopic level and that the overall variance of the field is well-behaved, reflecting the physical cost of creating interfaces.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{V k_{B} T}{f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3351805"}]}
