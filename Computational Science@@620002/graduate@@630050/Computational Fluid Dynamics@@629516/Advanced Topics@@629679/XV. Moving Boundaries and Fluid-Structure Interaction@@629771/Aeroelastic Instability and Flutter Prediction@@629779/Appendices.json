The times $t_0, t_1, t_2$ are consecutive local maxima. For a slightly growing sinusoidal function, the time between consecutive maxima is approximately the period of oscillation, $T$. This approximation is very accurate when the growth rate $\\sigma$ is small compared to the frequency $\\omega$, which is typical for flutter onset. The problem setup with uniformly spaced time points for the maxima confirms we should use this assumption. The period $T$ is the interval between consecutive maxima:\n$$T = t_1 - t_0 = 0.100~\\mathrm{s} - 0.000~\\mathrm{s} = 0.100~\\mathrm{s}$$\nChecking with the next interval gives the same result: $T = t_2 - t_1 = 0.200~\\mathrm{s} - 0.100~\\mathrm{s} = 0.100~\\mathrm{s}$.\nNow we can calculate the angular frequency $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T} = \\frac{2\\pi}{0.100~\\mathrm{s}} = 20\\pi~\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNumerically, this is $\\omega \\approx 62.83185...~\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $\\omega \\approx 62.83~\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we determine the growth rate $\\sigma$. We examine the ratio of the displacement values at two consecutive maxima, occurring at times $t_k$ and $t_{k+1} = t_k + T$.\n$$x(t_k) = A \\exp(\\sigma t_k) \\cos(\\omega t_k + \\phi)$$\n$$x(t_{k+1}) = x(t_k + T) = A \\exp(\\sigma (t_k + T)) \\cos(\\omega (t_k + T) + \\phi)$$\nSince $\\omega T = (2\\pi/T)T = 2\\pi$, the cosine term is periodic with period $T$. At the maxima, the cosine terms are not exactly 1, but they are equal for two points separated by a period $T$.\n$$\\cos(\\omega(t_k + T) + \\phi) = \\cos(\\omega t_k + 2\\pi + \\phi) = \\cos(\\omega t_k + \\phi)$$\nTherefore, the ratio of consecutive maxima simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{x(t_{k+1})}{x(t_k)} = \\frac{A \\exp(\\sigma t_k) \\exp(\\sigma T) \\cos(\\omega t_k + \\phi)}{A \\exp(\\sigma t_k) \\cos(\\omega t_k + \\phi)} = \\exp(\\sigma T)$$\nThis technique is known as the logarithmic decrement method (or increment, for growth).

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution\n\nThe solution is developed in four steps: 1) derivation of the complete aeroelastic equation of motion, 2) derivation of the energy criterion for flutter, 3) formulation of the generalized-$\\alpha$ numerical integration scheme, and 4) description of the computational algorithm.\n\n**1. Aeroelastic Equation of Motion**\n\nThe structural system is governed by Newton's second law for a linear mass-spring-damper system:\n$$m\\ddot{x}(t) + c\\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = F_a(t)$$\nwhere $m$, $c$, and $k$ are the structural mass, viscous damping, and stiffness, respectively. $x(t)$ is the generalized displacement, and $F_a(t)$ is the generalized aerodynamic force.\n\nThe problem specifies a linear aerodynamic model, where the force is a linear combination of the displacement, velocity, and acceleration. This is a common approximation for small perturbations. The force is expressed as:\n$$F_a(t) = k_a x(t) + c_a \\dot{x}(t) + h_a \\ddot{x}(t)$$\nHere, $k_a$ is the aerodynamic stiffness, $c_a$ represents aerodynamic damping effects (a positive $c_a$ often corresponds to an energy-producing mechanism, i.e., negative physical damping), and $h_a$ is the added or aerodynamic mass.\n\nSubstituting the aerodynamic force into the equation of motion and rearranging all terms to one side yields the homogeneous, second-order linear ordinary differential equation for the complete aero-structural system:\n$$m\\ddot{x}(t) + c\\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = k_a x(t) + c_a \\dot{x}(t) + h_a \\ddot{x}(t)$$\n$$(m - h_a)\\ddot{x}(t) + (c - c_a)\\dot{x}(t) + (k - k_a)x(t) = 0$$\nThis equation can be written in the standard form $m_{eff}\\ddot{x}(t) + c_{eff}\\dot{x}(t) + k_{eff}x(t) = 0$, with effective mass $m_{eff} = m - h_a$, effective damping $c_{eff} = c - c_a$, and effective stiffness $k_{eff} = k - k_a$. The stability of the system is determined by the sign of the effective damping, $c_{eff}$. Physical flutter, an unstable self-excited oscillation, occurs when $c_{eff} < 0$, which is equivalent to $c_a > c$.\n\n**2. Energy Criterion for Flutter**\n\nThe work-energy theorem states that the rate of change of a system's mechanical energy is equal to the power supplied by all non-conservative forces. The mechanical energy of the *structural* system is $E_{mech}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}(t)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx(t)^2$. Its time derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dE_{mech}}{dt} = m\\dot{x}\\ddot{x} + kx\\dot{x} = \\dot{x}(m\\ddot{x} + kx)$$\nFrom the original structural equation, we substitute $m\\ddot{x} + kx = F_a(t) - c\\dot{x}$, yielding:\n$$\\frac{dE_{mech}}{dt} = \\dot{x}(F_a(t) - c\\dotx}(t)) = F_a(t)\\dot{x}(t) - c\\dot{x}(t)^2$$\nLet $P_a(t) = F_a(t)\\dot{x}(t)$ be the power input from the aerodynamic forces, and let $P_d(t) = c\\dot{x}(t)^2$ be the power dissipated by structural damping.\n\nThe net change in the structure's mechanical energy over one cycle of oscillation, with period $T$, is the integral of the net power:\n$$\\Delta E_{mech} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{dE_{mech}}{dt} dt = \\int_{0}^{T} P_a(t) dt - \\int_{0}^{T} P_d(t) dt = W_a - W_d$$\nHere, $W_a$ is the total work done by the aerodynamic forces on the structure, and $W_d$ is the total energy dissipated by the structural damping over one cycle.\n\nThe problem defines physical flutter as a state where net physical energy is injected into the system, overcoming structural dissipation. This corresponds to a net increase in the structure's mechanical energy over a cycle. The criterion is therefore:\n$$\\text{Flutter} \\iff \\Delta E_{mech} > 0 \\iff W_a - W_d > 0$$\nThis energy-based criterion is robust because it directly quantifies the physical energy exchange, independent of any artificial damping introduced by the numerical integration scheme.\n\n**3. Generalized-$\\alpha$ Numerical Integration**\n\nThe generalized-$\\alpha$ method is an implicit, second-order accurate time integration scheme for structural dynamics. It provides user-controlled numerical damping of high frequencies, governed by the spectral radius at infinity, $\\rho_\\infty \\in [0, 1]$. Lower values of $\\rho_\\infty$ introduce more damping.\n\nThe method solves the equation of motion at an intermediate point in the time step $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$:\n$$m_{eff} \\ddot{x}_{n+1-\\alpha_m} + c_{eff} \\dot{x}_{n+1-\\alpha_f} + k_{eff} x_{n+1-\\alpha_f} = 0$$\nThe intermediate states are weighted averages of the states at $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$:\n$$x_{n+1-\\alpha_f} = (1-\\alpha_f)x_{n+1} + \\alpha_f x_n$$\n$$\\dot{x}_{n+1-\\alpha_f} = (1-\\alpha_f)\\dot{x}_{n+1} + \\alpha_f \\dot{x}_n$$\n$$\\ddot{x}_{n+1-\\alpha_m} = (1-\\alpha_m)\\ddot{x}_{n+1} + \\alpha_m \\ddot{x}_n$$\nThe state updates follow the Newmark-$\\beta$ family of relations:\n$$\\dot{x}_{n+1} = \\dot{x}_n + \\Delta t[(1-\\gamma)\\ddot{x}_n + \\gamma \\ddot{x}_{n+1}]$$\n$$x_{n+1} = x_n + \\Delta t \\dot{x}_n + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2}[(1-2\\beta)\\ddot{x}_n + 2\\beta \\ddot{x}_{n+1}]$$\nFor second-order accuracy and optimal high-frequency dissipation, the parameters are defined in terms of $\\rho_\\infty$:\n$$\\alpha_m = \\frac{2\\rho_\\infty - 1}{\\rho_\\infty + 1}, \\quad \\alpha_f = \\frac{\\rho_\\infty}{\\rho_\\infty + 1}$$\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2} - \\alpha_m + \\alpha_f, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{1}{4}(1 - \\alpha_m + \\alpha_f)^2$$\n\n**4. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe algorithm integrates the equation of motion for one structural period $T$ and computes the energies $W_a$ and $W_d$.\n\n1.  **Initialization**: For each test case, the structural period $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k}$ and time step $\\Delta t$ are calculated. The effective system parameters ($m_{eff}, c_{eff}, k_{eff}$) and the generalized-$\\alpha$ parameters ($\\alpha_m, \\alpha_f, \\gamma, \\beta$) are computed. The state vectors for displacement $x$, velocity $\\dot{x}$, and acceleration $\\ddot{x}$ are initialized according to the given initial conditions $x_0=A$, $\\dot{x}_0=0$, $\\ddot{x}_0=0$.\n\n2.  **Time-Stepping**: The system is advanced from $t=0$ to $t=T$. In each step from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$:\n    a.  The goal is to solve for the unknown acceleration $\\ddot{x}_{n+1}$. The Newmark relations are substituted into the intermediate-state definitions, which are then substituted into the main equation of motion. For a linear system, this yields a single linear equation for $\\ddot{x}_{n+1}$:\n    $$\\ddot{x}_{n+1} [ m_{eff}(1-\\alpha_m) + c_{eff}(1-\\alpha_f)\\gamma\\Delta t + k_{eff}(1-\\alpha_f)\\beta\\Delta t^2 ] = -\\text{RHS}(x_n, \\dot{x}_n, \\ddot{x}_n)$$\n    where the right-hand side, $\\text{RHS}$, contains all terms dependent on the state at $t_n$.\n    b.  Once $\\ddot{x}_{n+1}$ is computed, the velocity $\\dot{x}_{n+1}$ and displacement $x_{n+1}$ are found using the explicit Newmark update formulas.\n\n3.  **Energy Calculation**: The work integrals $W_a$ and $W_d$ are computed numerically over the interval $[0, T]$ using the trapezoidal rule. In each time step $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$, the contribution to the integrals is:\n    $$\\Delta W_a = \\frac{P_a(t_n) + P_a(t_{n+1})}{2}\\Delta t$$\n    $$\\Delta W_d = \\frac{P_d(t_n) + P_d(t_{n+1})}{2}\\Delta t$$\n    where the powers are $P_a(t) = (k_a x(t) + c_a \\dot{x}(t) + h_a \\ddot{x}(t))\\dot{x}(t)$ and $P_d(t) = c\\dot{x}(t)^2$. These contributions are summed over all time steps.\n\n4.  **Classification**: After completing the integration over one period, the net energy change $\\Delta E_{mech} = W_a - W_d$ is calculated. The system is classified as physically fluttering if and only if $\\Delta E_{mech}$ is strictly positive. A small numerical tolerance is used in the comparison to account for floating-point inaccuracies, particularly for the neutrally stable case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the aeroelastic flutter problem for a set of test cases.\n    \n    This function implements a generalized-alpha time integrator to simulate a\n    single-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic oscillator.
