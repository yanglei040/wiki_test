This exercise demonstrates that the general FW–H formulation correctly reproduces well-known results from classical acoustics.

It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in classical acoustics and aeroacoustics. The premises are physically coherent, and the required data and conditions are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is objective and uses standard terminology and assumptions within the field.\n\nThe problem asks for the acoustic pressure radiated by a pulsating sphere, derived from the thickness term of the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW–H) analogy. The FW–H equation is an exact rearrangement of the conservation of mass and momentum into an inhomogeneous wave equation. The general solution for the acoustic pressure perturbation $p'(\\mathbf{x}, t) = p(\\mathbf{x}, t) - p_0$ is given by a sum of three integral terms, representing thickness (monopole), loading (dipole), and quadrupole sources.\n\nWe are instructed to use only the thickness term, which accounts for the displacement of fluid by the motion of the surface. For an observer at position $\\mathbf{x}$ at time $t$, this term is given by:\n$$\np'_{T}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{S} \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_0 v_n}{r_s |1 - M_r|} \\right]_{\\tau} dS(\\mathbf{y})\n$$\nHere, $S$ is the surface of the body, $\\mathbf{y}$ is a point on the surface, $v_n$ is the local surface velocity normal to the surface (defined positive outwards), $\\rho_0$ is the ambient fluid density, $r_s = |\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}|$ is the distance from a source point to the observer, $M_r$ is the Mach number of the surface in the direction of the observer, and the notation $[\\cdot]_{\\tau}$ indicates that the quantity in the brackets is evaluated at the retarded time $\\tau = t - r_s/c_0$, where $c_0$ is the speed of sound.\n\nThe problem states several simplifying conditions:\n1.  The fluid is quiescent, meaning there is no background flow, so the sphere's surface motion relative to the fluid is its absolute motion. The sphere is not translating, so its surface Mach number $M_r$ is zero.\n2.  The observer is in the far field, so $r \\gg a$, where $r$ is the distance from the center of the sphere to the observer. This allows the approximation $r_s = |\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}| \\approx r$. We can therefore move the $1/r_s$ factor outside the integral as $1/r$.\n3.  The sphere is acoustically compact ($ka \\ll 1$, where $k = \\omega/c_0$). This justifies approximating the retarded time for all points on the surface with a single value based on the sphere's center: $\\tau = t - r/c_0$.\n\nApplying these simplifications, the thickness term reduces to:\n$$\np'(r, t) \\approx \\frac{1}{4\\pi r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{S} \\left[ \\rho_0 v_n \\right]_{\\tau} dS(\\mathbf{y})\n$$\nwhere $\\tau = t - r/c_0$.\n\nThe sphere undergoes spatially uniform, radial pulsations described by the surface displacement $\\xi(t) = \\xi_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$. The surface velocity $v_n$ is the time derivative of this displacement:\n$$\nv_n(t) = \\frac{d\\xi}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\xi_0 \\sin(\\omega t)) = \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nSince the pulsations are uniform, $v_n$ is constant over the entire surface $S$ at any given instant. We can take it and the constant ambient density $\\rho_0$ out of the integral:\n$$\np'(r, t) \\approx \\frac{\\rho_0}{4\\pi r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ v_n(t) \\right]_{\\tau} \\int_{S} dS\n$$\nThe integral is the surface area of the sphere, which is $4\\pi a^2$.\n$$\np'(r, t) \\approx \\frac{\\rho_0 (4\\pi a^2)}{4\\pi r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ v_n(t) \\right]_{\\tau} = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} v_n(\\tau)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_n$ and evaluating at the retarded time $\\tau = t - r/c_0$:\n$$\np'(r, t) = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega(t - r/c_0)) \\right)\n$$\nPerforming the time differentiation using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega(t - r/c_0)) \\right) = \\xi_0 \\omega \\left( -\\sin(\\omega(t - r/c_0)) \\cdot \\omega \\right) = -\\xi_0 \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega(t - r/c_0))\n$$\nSubstituting this back gives the final expression for the acoustic pressure:\n$$\np'(r, t) = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2}{r} \\left( -\\xi_0 \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega(t - r/c_0)) \\right) = - \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2}{r} \\sin\\left(\\omega \\left(t - \\frac{r}{c_0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem next asks to compare this expression to the classic compact-monopole solution. A compact pulsating sphere is the canonical example of an acoustic monopole, or simple source. The acoustic field of a simple source can be described by a velocity potential $\\phi$ that produces a spherically symmetric, outgoing wave, $\\phi(r,t) = f(t-r/c_0)/r$. The acoustic pressure is $p' = \\rho_0 \\partial \\phi / \\partial t$ and the radial velocity is $u_r = -\\partial \\phi / \\partial r$.\n\nThe boundary condition is that the fluid velocity at the sphere's surface matches the surface velocity: $u_r(a,t) = v_n(t)$. For a compact source ($ka \\ll 1$), the near-field term in the velocity expression dominates, so $u_r(a,t) \\approx f(t)/a^2$.\nThus, $f(t) \\approx a^2 v_n(t) = a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nThe far-field pressure is given by:\n$$\np'(r,t) = \\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{r} f'(t-r/c_0)\n$$\nWe find $f'(t)$ by differentiating $f(t)$:\n$$\nf'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)) = -a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nEvaluating this at the retarded time gives:\n$$\np'(r,t) = \\frac{\\rho_0}{r} \\left( -a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega(t-r/c_0)) \\right) = - \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2}{r} \\sin\\left(\\omega \\left(t - \\frac{r}{c_0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained from the FW–H thickness term. Therefore, the thickness term of the FW–H analogy, when applied to a compact pulsating body, correctly reproduces the classic compact-monopole solution. They do coincide. The radiated pressure is proportional to the surface acceleration, hence the $-\\sin$ dependence, which is $90^\\circ$ out of phase with the velocity ($\\cos$).\nThe retarded time is $\\tau = t - r/c_0$.\n\nThe final expression for the acoustic pressure is:\n$$\np'(r, t) = - \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2 \\xi_0 \\omega^2}{r} \\sin\\left(\\omega \\left(t - \\frac{r}{c_0}\\right)\\right)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{- \\frac{\\rho_{0} a^{2} \\xi_{0} \\omega^{2}}{r} \\sin\\left(\\omega \\left(t - \\frac{r}{c_{0}}\\right)\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3288158"}, {"introduction": "Having validated the analogy for a simple moving surface, we now turn to a more complex and practical scenario: the noise generated by a turbulent jet.

It is a well-posed, scientifically sound, and objective question in the field of aeroacoustics. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe generation of sound from a turbulent jet is described by Lighthill's acoustic analogy, which reformulates the Navier-Stokes equations into an inhomogeneous wave equation for the density or pressure fluctuations. In the far field, the acoustic pressure $p'(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ is given by a volume integral of the Lighthill stress tensor $T_{ij}$ over the source region $\\Omega$, evaluated at the retarded time.\n\nTwo key physical aspects from the problem statement dominate the characteristics of the far-field sound:\n1.  **Source Convection:** The turbulent eddies, which are the sources of sound, are not stationary but are convected by the mean flow at velocity $\\boldsymbol{V}_c$.\n2.  **Finite Source Extent:** The source region $\\Omega$ is not a point but is spatially distributed, with a characteristic size $L$.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each.\n\n**1. Effect of Source Convection ($\\boldsymbol{V}_c$)**\nA source moving towards or away from an observer causes the observed frequency and amplitude to differ from the emitted ones.\n-   **Frequency Shift (Doppler Effect):** A source oscillating with a frequency $\\omega_s$ in its own reference frame, moving with velocity $\\boldsymbol{V}_c$, will be observed at a frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ in the stationary frame. The relationship is given by the Doppler formula:\n    $$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{\\omega_s}{1 - \\boldsymbol{M}_c \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}} = \\frac{\\omega_s}{1 - M_c \\cos\\theta} $$\n    where $\\boldsymbol{M}_c = \\boldsymbol{V}_c / c_0$ is the convection Mach number vector. For downstream observers ($\\theta < 90^\\circ, \\cos\\theta > 0$), $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} > \\omega_s$ (frequency up-shift). For upstream observers ($\\theta > 90^\\circ, \\cos\\theta < 0$), $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} < \\omega_s$ (frequency down-shift).\n-   **Amplitude Modulation (Convective Amplification):** The motion of the source also affects the amplitude of the radiated sound. This arises from two effects: the relationship between emission time intervals and reception time intervals ($dt_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (1 - M_c \\cos\\theta) d\\tau_s$), and the fact that time derivatives in the wave equation operator act on the source. The combination of these effects leads to a strong amplification of the sound intensity in the forward (downstream) direction and attenuation in the rearward (upstream) direction. The sound pressure amplitude $p'$ is amplified by a factor proportional to $(1 - M_c \\cos\\theta)^{-\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive exponent typically between $2$ and $3$ for jet noise quadrupoles. This creates a highly directional \"beaming\" of sound in the forward arc. This is often called a \"forward-backward amplitude bias\".\n\n**2. Effect of Finite Source Extent ($L$)**\nThe far-field pressure is an integral over the source volume $\\Omega$. For a given observer, signals from different points $\\boldsymbol{y}$ within the source region travel slightly different path lengths to the observer, resulting in phase differences. The phase of the contribution from a point $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is related to the term $e^{i k_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{y}}$, where $k_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}}/c_0$.\n-   **Interference and Aperture Effect:** The total sound field is a coherent sum (integral) of these contributions. The phase differences lead to constructive and destructive interference. This process is analogous to diffraction from a finite aperture. The spatial distribution of the source acts as a filter in both angle and frequency. For a simplified source distribution (e.g., uniform along the length $L$), the integral along the streamwise direction yields a factor of the form $\\mathrm{sinc}(K L/2)$ where $K$ is an effective wavenumber. This `sinc` function (or a similar function for a more realistic source distribution) modulates the spectrum and the directivity. This interference leads to partial cancellation of sound, especially at higher frequencies where the wavelength is small compared to $L$. It also is responsible for narrowing the main radiation lobe and creating side lobes.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on this physical understanding.\n\n**A. The retarded-time relation for a uniformly convecting source region produces a Doppler shift of observed frequency, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\omega/(1 - M_c \\cos\\theta)$ for content at angular frequency $\\omega$ inside $\\Omega$, and an associated forward–backward amplitude bias; the finite spatial extent $L$ causes phase differences across $\\Omega$ that act as an angular and spectral aperture filter (approximately a $\\mathrm{sinc}$ envelope), narrowing forward lobes and smoothing spectra via partial cancellations.**\nThis statement is a comprehensive and accurate summary of the physics. It correctly identifies:\n-   The Doppler shift formula.\n-   The \"forward–backward amplitude bias\" (convective amplification).\n-   The role of finite extent ($L$) in causing phase differences.\n-   The resulting \"aperture filter\" effect, correctly approximated by a `sinc` envelope.\n-   The consequences of this filtering, such as partial cancellations and modification of the radiation pattern (\"narrowing forward lobes\").\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Provided $M_c < 1$, convection does not alter the observed frequency; Doppler effects only occur for supersonic $M_c > 1$, so far-field spectra and directivity remain those of an equivalent stationary quadrupole, up to a uniform time delay.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The Doppler effect occurs for *any* non-zero relative motion, whether subsonic ($M_c < 1$) or supersonic ($M_c > 1$). The claim that subsonic convection does not alter the frequency is false. Consequently, the conclusion that the spectra and directivity are unchanged is also false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The finite extent $L$ increases the far-field amplitude at all angles by a factor proportional to $L$, with no phase cancellation, because quadrupole sources add coherently independent of $\\theta$; convection only changes the total power through an overall attenuation factor proportional to $\\sqrt{1 - M_c^2}$.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors.\n-   It incorrectly claims sources add coherently with no phase cancellation. The finite extent $L$ is precisely the reason for phase cancellations (interference), which typically makes the source less efficient than a fully coherent one.\n-   The dependence of amplitude on $L$ is not a simple proportionality.\n-   The effect of convection is not a uniform attenuation factor. It's the strongly angle-dependent factor $(1-M_c\\cos\\theta)$, which causes amplification downstream. The factor $\\sqrt{1 - M_c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor from special relativity and is not the correct form for this acoustic problem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings framework, replacing the convecting volume by a permeable moving surface eliminates the Doppler and convective amplification factors, making the radiated field isotropic for subsonic $M_c$.**\nThis statement misinterprets the FWH framework. The FWH equation is a mathematical identity, an exact rearrangement of the equations of motion. It cannot eliminate real physical effects. If a permeable surface is used to compute the sound, the information about source convection is encoded in the monopole and dipole source strengths on that surface. If the surface itself is chosen to move, its motion must be accounted for, which explicitly re-introduces the Doppler and convective amplification factors in the FWH Green's function. The radiated field from a jet is highly directional, not isotropic.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The space–time spectrum of the convecting turbulence is dominated by the convection relation $\\omega \\approx \\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{V}_c$ (a “convective ridge”), and the far-field integral maps this into the acoustic field with an angular Doppler transformation; the finite $L$ acts as a streamwise aperture whose Fourier transform is approximately a $\\mathrm{sinc}$, so apparent source motion manifests as frequency shift and forward-biased directivity with attenuation away from angles that satisfy a stationary-phase condition.**\nThis statement provides a more advanced, but equally valid, perspective from the wavenumber-frequency domain.\n-   The \"convective ridge\" is a correct description of the source spectrum of convecting turbulence, a consequence of Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis.\n-   The far-field radiation integral acts as a filter, selecting components from the source spectrum. The \"angular Doppler transformation\" is a correct, if slightly non-standard, term for this mapping.\n-   The description of the finite extent $L$ as an aperture with a `sinc`-like Fourier transform is correct. This spatial finiteness is what broadens the convective ridge in wavenumber space, allowing its \"tail\" to radiate sound even in the subsonic case.\n-   The conclusion that this process results in frequency shift and forward-biased directivity is correct.\n-   The reference to a \"stationary-phase condition\" is a sophisticated and correct way to explain why radiation is most efficient in certain directions.\nThis entire statement is a correct and insightful description of the underlying physics.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nBoth statements A and E provide correct descriptions of the phenomenon. Statement A uses a more direct, cause-and-effect explanation in the time and space domain. Statement E uses a more formal description in the frequency-wavenumber domain.

Percentages are not used; all ratios are pure decimals.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of signal processing, acoustics, and computational fluid dynamics, and it is well-posed with a clear, objective, and complete set of definitions and inputs.\n\nThe objective is to formulate an algorithm for determining the necessary sampling parameters for aeroacoustic data, derived from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, to resolve acoustic content up to a specified frequency, accounting for Doppler shifts and CFD solver constraints. The derivation proceeds from first principles as outlined.\n\n**1. Derivation of Minimum Sampling Frequency ($f_{s, \\min}$)**\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that to resolve a signal with a maximum frequency component $f_{\\text{highest}}$, the sampling frequency $f_s$ must be at least twice this maximum frequency, i.e., $f_s \\ge 2 f_{\\text{highest}}$.\n\nIn the context of aeroacoustics, a frequency $f_{\\text{source}}$ in the source's reference frame is observed at a frequency $f_{\\text{obs}}$ modified by the Doppler effect. The relationship is $f_{\\text{obs}} = \\mathcal{D} f_{\\text{source}}$, where $\\mathcal{D}$ is the Doppler factor. To ensure that the acoustic content is resolved for all possible observer locations and source motions, we must consider the worst-case scenario. This corresponds to the maximum possible source frequency, $f_{\\max}$, being amplified by the maximum possible Doppler factor, $\\mathcal{D}_{\\max}$.\n\nThe highest frequency present in any observed signal is therefore:\n$$ f_{\\text{obs,max}} = \\mathcal{D}_{\\max} f_{\\max} $$\nApplying the Nyquist-Shannon theorem to this highest observed frequency, the minimum required sampling frequency, $f_{s, \\min}$, is:\n$$ f_{s, \\min} = 2 f_{\\text{obs,max}} = 2 \\mathcal{D}_{\\max} f_{\\max} $$\nThis derivation confirms the first required formula.\n\n**2. Derivation of Maximum Admissible Sampling Interval ($\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}}$)**\n\nThe sampling interval, $\\Delta t$, is the reciprocal of the sampling frequency, $f_s$, such that $\\Delta t = 1/f_s$. The requirement for the sampling frequency is an inequality: $f_s \\ge f_{s, \\min}$. Expressing this in terms of the sampling interval gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\ge f_{s, \\min} \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{f_{s, \\min}} $$\nThis inequality shows that there is a maximum permissible sampling interval, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}}$, that still satisfies the sampling theorem. This maximum interval corresponds to the minimum sampling frequency:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}} = \\frac{1}{f_{s, \\min}} $$\nThis confirms the second required relationship.\n\n**3. Analysis of Data Decimation and Feasibility**\n\nThe CFD solver advances time using discrete steps, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}}$, governed by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) stability condition. For an explicit scheme, this time step is given by:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}} = \\frac{C \\, \\Delta x}{a_{\\mathrm{char}}} $$\nwhere $C$ is the Courant number, $\\Delta x$ is the grid spacing, and $a_{\\mathrm{char}}$ is the characteristic wave speed. For compressible flow with sound propagation, a conservative choice for $a_{\\mathrm{char}}$ is the sum of the ambient sound speed $c_0$ and the maximum flow speed magnitude $\\lvert U_{\\max} \\rvert$:\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{char}} = c_0 + \\lvert U_{\\max} \\rvert $$\nTo reduce data storage, it is common to sample the CFD data not at every time step, but every $k$-th step, where $k$ is an integer decimation factor, $k \\ge 1$. The sampling interval of the stored signal is thus:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{sample}} = k \\, \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}} $$\nTo satisfy the Nyquist criterion, this sampling interval must not exceed the maximum admissible interval:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{sample}} \\le \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}} \\implies k \\, \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}} \\le \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nSolving for $k$ gives the constraint on the decimation factor:\n$$ k \\le \\frac{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}}}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}}} $$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the largest permissible value for the decimation factor, $k_{\\max}$, is the floor of this ratio:\n$$ k_{\\max} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}}}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}}} \\right\\rfloor $$\nThis sampling strategy is considered feasible if there exists at least one integer $k \\ge 1$ that satisfies the condition. This is true if and only if $k_{\\max} \\ge 1$. If $k_{\\max} = 0$, it implies that $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}} > \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}}$, meaning that even sampling every CFD step ($k=1$) is insufficient.\n\n**4. Derivation of Maximum Courant Number ($C_{\\max}$)**\n\nWe now determine the maximum Courant number, $C_{\\max}$, for which sampling every CFD step ($k=1$) is sufficient. The condition for sufficiency with $k=1$ is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}} \\le \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}}$. Substituting the expressions for $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{CFD}}$ and $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{req}}$:\n$$ \\frac{C \\, \\Delta x}{a_{\\mathrm{char}}} \\le \\frac{1}{f_{s, \\min}} $$\nTo find the maximum Courant number, we solve for $C$:\n$$ C \\le \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{char}}}{\\Delta x \\, f_{s, \\min}} $$\nThe upper limit of this inequality gives the maximum permissible Courant number, $C_{\\max}$:\n$$ C_{\\max} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{char}}}{\\Delta x \\, f_{s, \\min}} $$\nIf the solver is run with a Courant number $C > C_{\\max}$, it will be impossible to meet the Nyquist criterion for the desired acoustic frequency $f_{\\max}$, even if every time step is stored.\n\nThese derivations provide a complete set of formulae to implement the required algorithm.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_sampling_params(f_max, D_max, dx, c0, U_max, C):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates sampling parameters for aeroacoustic post-processing.\n\n    Args:\n        f_max (float): Maximum source frequency in Hz.\n        D_max (float): Maximum Doppler factor (dimensionless).\n        dx (float): Grid spacing in m.\n        c0 (float): Ambient sound speed in m/s.\n        U_max (float): Maximum flow speed magnitude in m/s.\n        C (float): Courant number (dimensionless).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing [f_s_min, dt_req, dt_cfd, k_max, feasible, C_max].\n    \"\"\"\n    # Task 1: Minimum sampling frequency\n    # f_s_min = 2 * D_max * f_max\n    f_s_min = 2.0 * D_max * f_max\n\n    # Task 2: Maximum admissible sampling interval\n    # dt_req = 1 / f_s_min\n    dt_req = 1.0 / f_s_min\n\n    # Task 3: CFD time step and decimation factor\n    # a_char = c_0 + |U_max|\n    a_char = c0 + U_max\n    # dt_cfd = (C * dx) / a_char\n    dt_cfd = (C * dx) / a_char\n    \n    # k_max = floor(dt_req / dt_cfd)\n    # Ensure dt_cfd is not zero to prevent division by zero,\n    # though physically it must be positive for a simulation to advance.\n    if dt_cfd > 0.0:\n        k_max = int(np.floor(dt_req / dt_cfd))\n    else:\n        # This case is physically unrealistic but handled for robustness.\n        # If dt_cfd is zero, any sampling interval is infinitely larger, so k_max is 0.\n        k_max = 0\n    \n    # Feasibility is true if k_max is at least 1.\n    feasible = k_max >= 1\n\n    # Task 4: Maximum Courant number\n    # C_max = a_char / (dx * f_s_min)\n    denominator_c_max = dx * f_s_min\n    if denominator_c_max > 0.0:\n        C_max = a_char / denominator_c_max\n    else:\n        # Physically unrealistic, implies infinite C_max is allowed.\n        C_max = float('inf')\n\n    return [f_s_min, dt_req, dt_cfd, k_max, feasible, C_max]\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes the calculations for the test cases provided in the problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test cases: (f_max, D_max, dx, c0, U_max, C)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        (2000.0, 1.2, 0.005, 343.0, 50.0, 0.5),\n        # Case B\n        (1000.0, 1.0, 1.0, 340.0, 10.0, 0.175),\n        # Case C\n        (5000.0, 1.3, 0.04, 343.0, 27.0, 0.8),\n        # Case D\n        (800.0, 1.5, 0.002, 330.0, 20.0, 0.6),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        f_max, D_max, dx, c0, U_max, C = case\n        result = calculate_sampling_params(f_max, D_max, dx, c0, U_max, C)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Format the output as a string representation of a list of lists.\n    # The map(str, results) converts each sub-list into its string form,\n    # e.g., '[4800.0, ...]', and join combines them with commas.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3288213"}]}
