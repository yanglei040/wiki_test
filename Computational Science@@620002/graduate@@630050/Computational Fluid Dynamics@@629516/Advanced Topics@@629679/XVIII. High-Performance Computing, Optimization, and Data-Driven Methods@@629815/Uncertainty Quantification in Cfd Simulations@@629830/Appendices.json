The problem describes a fully developed, steady, incompressible, laminar pipe flow, for which the relationship between pressure drop $\\Delta p$ and mean velocity $U$ is indeed linear, as per the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The relationship is given as $\\Delta p = kU$ for some positive constant $k$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all terms are clearly defined. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Express $\\Delta p$ as a function of the standard normal variable $\\xi$\nThe uncertain inlet velocity $U$ is given as a Gaussian random variable $U \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. We can express $U$ in terms of a standard normal random variable $\\xi \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ through the affine transformation:\n$$\nU = \\mu + \\sigma\\xi\n$$\nThe quantity of interest, the pressure drop $\\Delta p$, is related to $U$ by the linear model $\\Delta p = kU$. Substituting the expression for $U$ gives $\\Delta p$ as a function of $\\xi$:\n$$\n\\Delta p(\\xi) = k(\\mu + \\sigma\\xi) = k\\mu + k\\sigma\\xi\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\Delta p$ is an affine function of the standard normal variable $\\xi$.\n\n### Step 2: Approximate moments using level-2 Gauss-Hermite collocation\nLevel-$2$ stochastic collocation in one dimension, as specified, corresponds to a two-point Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule for approximating expectations with respect to the standard normal distribution. The expectation of a function $f(\\xi)$ where $\\xi \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ is given by $\\mathbb{E}[f(\\xi)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\xi) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-\\frac{\\xi^2}{2}) d\\xi$.\n\nThe two-point Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule for this integral is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[f(\\xi)] \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_i f(\\xi_i)\n$$\nThe collocation points (nodes) $\\xi_i$ are the roots of the second-degree probabilist's Hermite polynomial, $He_2(\\xi) = \\xi^2 - 1$. The roots are:\n$$\n\\xi_1 = -1, \\quad \\xi_2 = 1\n$$\nThe corresponding weights $w_i$ are found by requiring the quadrature to be exact for low-degree polynomials. For $\\mathbb{E}[1]=1$, we need $w_1+w_2=1$. For $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi]=0$, we need $w_1(-1)+w_2(1)=0$. Solving this system gives:\n$$\nw_1 = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad w_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis quadrature rule is exact for all polynomials of degree up to $2 \\times 2 - 1 = 3$.\n\nWe first evaluate our function $\\Delta p(\\xi)$ at the collocation points:\n$$\n\\Delta p(\\xi_1) = \\Delta p(-1) = k\\mu + k\\sigma(-1) = k(\\mu - \\sigma)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p(\\xi_2) = \\Delta p(1) = k\\mu + k\\sigma(1) = k(\\mu + \\sigma)\n$$\nNow we approximate the mean of $\\Delta p$ using the collocation formula:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{coll}}[\\Delta p] = w_1 \\Delta p(\\xi_1) + w_2 \\Delta p(\\xi_2) = \\frac{1}{2} [k(\\mu - \\sigma)] + \\frac{1}{2} [k(\\mu + \\sigma)]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{coll}}[\\Delta p] = \\frac{k}{2} (\\mu - \\sigma + \\mu + \\sigma) = \\frac{k}{2} (2\\mu) = k\\mu\n$$\nNext, we approximate the second moment of $\\Delta p$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{coll}}[(\\Delta p)^2] = w_1 [\\Delta p(\\xi_1)]^2 + w_2 [\\Delta p(\\xi_2)]^2 = \\frac{1}{2} [k(\\mu - \\sigma)]^2 + \\frac{1}{2} [k(\\mu + \\sigma)]^2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{coll}}[(\\Delta p)^2] = \\frac{k^2}{2} [(\\mu - \\sigma)^2 + (\\mu + \\sigma)^2] = \\frac{k^2}{2} [(\\mu^2 - 2\\mu\\sigma + \\sigma^2) + (\\mu^2 + 2\\mu\\sigma + \\sigma^2)]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{coll}}[(\\Delta p)^2] = \\frac{k^2}{2} [2\\mu^2 + 2\\sigma^2] = k^2(\\mu^2 + \\sigma^2)\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Construct the collocation-based variance\nThe variance is calculated from the mean and the second moment using the formula $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X])^2$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{coll}}(\\Delta p) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{coll}}[(\\Delta p)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{coll}}[\\Delta p])^2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{coll}}(\\Delta p) = k^2(\\mu^2 + \\sigma^2) - (k\\mu)^2 = k^2\\mu^2 + k^2\\sigma^2 - k^2\\mu^2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{coll}}(\\Delta p) = k^2\\sigma^2\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Derive the exact analytic moments\nWe derive the exact moments of $\\Delta p$ using properties of linear transformations of random variables. Given $\\Delta p = kU$ and $U \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$.\nThe exact mean is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{exact}}[\\Delta p] = \\mathbb{E}[kU] = k\\mathbb{E}[U] = k\\mu\n$$\nThe exact variance is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{exact}}(\\Delta p) = \\mathrm{Var}(kU) = k^2\\mathrm{Var}(U) = k^2\\sigma^2\n$$\nWe observe that the mean and variance obtained from the two-point Gauss-Hermite collocation are identical to the exact analytical values. This is because the quantity of interest $\\Delta p(\\xi)$ is a polynomial of degree $1$ in $\\xi$, and its square, $(\\Delta p(\\xi))^2$, is a polynomial of degree $2$. The two-point quadrature rule is exact for polynomials up to degree $3$, so it computes the first and second moments of $\\Delta p$ exactly.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the relative variance error\nThe relative error in the variance is defined as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{var}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{coll}}(\\Delta p) - \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{exact}}(\\Delta p)}{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{exact}}(\\Delta p)}\n$$\nSubstituting the results from Steps 3 and 4:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{var}} = \\frac{k^2\\sigma^2 - k^2\\sigma^2}{k^2\\sigma^2}\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial uncertainty case where $\\sigma^2 > 0$ (and given $k > 0$), the denominator is non-zero.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{var}} = \\frac{0}{k^2\\sigma^2} = 0\n$$\nThe relative variance error is exactly zero.

Let's consider the differences in the QoI between successive grids:\n$$Q_1 - Q_2 = C(h_1^p - h_2^p) = C( (r h_2)^p - h_2^p) = C h_2^p (r^p - 1)$$\n$$Q_2 - Q_3 = C(h_2^p - h_3^p) = C( (r h_3)^p - h_3^p) = C h_3^p (r^p - 1)$$\nTaking the ratio of these differences allows us to eliminate the constant $C$ and the term $(r^p - 1)$:\n$$\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3} = \\frac{C h_2^p (r^p - 1)}{C h_3^p (r^p - 1)} = \\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_3}\\right)^p = r^p$$\nWe can solve for $p$ by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$p \\ln(r) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3}\\right)$$\n$$p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3}\\right)}{\\ln(r)}$$\nSubstituting the given values $Q_1=0.590$, $Q_2=0.542$, $Q_3=0.530$, and $r=2$:\n$$Q_1 - Q_2 = 0.590 - 0.542 = 0.048$$\n$$Q_2 - Q_3 = 0.542 - 0.530 = 0.012$$\n$$p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.048}{0.012}\\right)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(4)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{\\ln(2)} = 2$$\nThe observed order of accuracy is $p=2$.\n\nNext, we quantify the discretization uncertainty, $U_{\\mathrm{disc}}$, on the fine grid ($h_3$). This is derived from the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) methodology. The estimated error on the fine grid, $E_3 = Q_3 - Q_0$, can be related to the difference between solutions on the fine and medium grids. From the equation for $Q_2 - Q_3$ derived above:\n$$Q_2 - Q_3 = C h_3^p (r^p - 1)$$\nThe error $E_3$ is approximated as $E_3 \\approx C h_3^p$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$Q_2 - Q_3 \\approx E_3 (r^p - 1)$$\nSolving for the estimated error on the fine grid:\n$$E_3 \\approx \\frac{Q_2 - Q_3}{r^p - 1}$$\nThe problem states that $U_{\\mathrm{disc}}$ is the absolute discretization uncertainty, obtained by applying a safety factor $\\beta$ to the magnitude of the estimated error.\n$$U_{\\mathrm{disc}} = \\beta |E_3| = \\beta \\left|\\frac{Q_2 - Q_3}{r^p - 1}\\right|$$\nSubstituting the known values $\\beta=1.25$, $p=2$, $r=2$, and the difference $Q_2 - Q_3 = 0.012$:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{disc}} = 1.25 \\times \\left|\\frac{0.012}{2^2 - 1}\\right| = 1.25 \\times \\frac{0.012}{3} = 1.25 \\times 0.004 = 0.005$$\n\nNext, we calculate the input-induced uncertainty, $U_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The problem provides the model based on a first-order sensitivity analysis:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{in}} = |S| \\,\\sigma_{\\alpha}$$\nSubstituting the given values $S=0.160$ and $\\sigma_{\\alpha}=0.020$:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{in}} = |0.160| \\times 0.020 = 0.160 \\times 0.020 = 0.0032$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\rho$ of the discretization uncertainty to the input uncertainty:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{disc}}}{U_{\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $U_{\\mathrm{disc}}$ and $U_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{0.005}{0.0032} = \\frac{500}{320} = \\frac{50}{32} = \\frac{25}{16} = 1.5625$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. Rounding $1.5625$ to four significant figures yields $1.563$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.563}$$", "id": "3385630"}]}
