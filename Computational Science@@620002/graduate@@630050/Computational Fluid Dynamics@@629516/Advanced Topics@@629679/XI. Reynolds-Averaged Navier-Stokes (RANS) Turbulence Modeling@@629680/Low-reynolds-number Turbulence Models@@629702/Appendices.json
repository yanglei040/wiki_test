First, we calculate the friction velocity, $u_{\\tau}$. Second, we use this value to compute $y^{+}$.\n\nStep 1: Calculation of the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$.\nThe friction velocity is defined as a characteristic velocity scale for the near-wall region of a turbulent flow.

It indicates the local position within the turbulent boundary layer relative to the characteristic viscous length scale. The near-wall region is typically divided into three main zones based on the value of $y^{+}$:\n1.  **Viscous Sublayer ($y^{+} \\lesssim 5$):** In this region immediately adjacent to the wall, viscous forces are dominant, and the turbulent fluctuations are heavily damped. The mean velocity profile is approximately linear with distance from the wall.\n2.  **Buffer Layer ($5 \\lesssim y^{+} \\lesssim 30$):** This is a transitional region where both viscous and turbulent stresses are of comparable magnitude. The velocity profile deviates from the linear and logarithmic laws.\n3.  **Log-Law Region ($y^{+} \\gtrsim 30$):** In this region, turbulent stresses dominate over viscous stresses, and the mean velocity profile follows a logarithmic distribution.\n\nLow-Reynolds-number (LRN) turbulence models are specifically formulated to resolve the flow field all the way to the solid wall, including the viscous sublayer and buffer layer. This is in contrast to \"High-Reynolds-number\" models that use wall functions to bridge the near-wall region, avoiding the need for a fine grid there. To accurately capture the steep gradients and the physics of the viscous sublayer, LRN models require a very fine computational grid near the wall. Specifically, the first grid point off the wall must be located well within the viscous sublayer.\n\nThe generally accepted criterion for grid placement when using an LRN model is that the first grid point should satisfy the condition $y^{+} \\approx 1$ or, more leniently, $y^{+} < 5$.\n\nThe computed value for the first grid point is $y^{+} \\approx 4.619$. This value is less than $5$, placing the first grid cell center within the viscous sublayer. Therefore, this grid spacing meets the fundamental requirement for the application of a Low-Reynolds-number turbulence model. However, it is important to note that this value is near the upper limit of the accepted range. For simulations requiring very high accuracy in predicting wall-related phenomena like skin friction and heat transfer, a finer grid with the first point located at $y^{+} \\approx 1$ would be preferable to better resolve the linear velocity profile.

We begin by analyzing the behavior of the velocity fluctuations near the smooth wall.\n\nLet the wall be located at the plane $y=0$. We use a Cartesian coordinate system $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ corresponding to $(x, y, z)$, with velocity fluctuations $(u'_1, u'_2, u'_3)$ corresponding to $(u', v', w')$.
