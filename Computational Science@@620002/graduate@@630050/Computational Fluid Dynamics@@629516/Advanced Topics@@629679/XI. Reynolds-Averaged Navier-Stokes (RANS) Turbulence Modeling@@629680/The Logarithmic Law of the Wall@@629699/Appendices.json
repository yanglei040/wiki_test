We may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the near-wall region of a turbulent boundary layer. The key to this analysis is the use of inner scaling, which normalizes variables based on characteristic scales derived from wall properties.\n\nFirst, we consider the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. This quantity represents the tangential force per unit area exerted by the fluid on the wall. From a dimensional standpoint, its units are force per area, which in base SI units is $\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$. In the context of momentum, $\\tau_w$ can be interpreted as the rate of momentum transfer (flux) per unit area from the flow to the wall. Given the fluid density, $\\rho$, with units of mass per volume ($\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$), the ratio $\\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho}$ has units of $(\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}) / (\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}) = \\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$, which corresponds to velocity squared. This leads to the definition of a characteristic velocity scale for the near-wall region, known as the friction velocity, $u_{\\tau}$:\n$$u_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho}}$$\n\nNext, we establish a characteristic length scale. In the region immediately adjacent to the wall (the viscous sublayer), momentum transfer is dominated by viscous diffusion. The parameter governing this diffusion is the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, with units of $\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$. By balancing the characteristic velocity $u_{\\tau}$ with the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, we can form a length scale. The viscous length scale, $\\delta_{\\nu}$, is defined as:\n$$\\delta_{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}}$$\nThis length scale provides a measure of the thickness of the region where viscous effects are dominant.\n\nUsing these two scales, we can define dimensionless variables, also known as inner coordinates or wall units. The dimensionless wall-normal distance, denoted as $y^+$, is the physical distance $y$ from the wall normalized by the viscous length scale $\\delta_{\\nu}$.\n$$y^{+} = \\frac{y}{\\delta_{\\nu}} = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}$$\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of the velocity scale $u_{\\tau}$ and the wall-unit coordinate $y^+$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Wall shear stress, $\\tau_{w} = 0.5 \\text{ Pa} = 0.5 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$\n- Mass density, $\\rho = 1.2 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$\n- Kinematic viscosity, $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Wall-normal distance, $y = 1 \\text{ mm} = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the friction velocity, $u_{\\tau}$:\n$$u_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5}{1.2}} = \\sqrt{0.41666...} \\approx 0.64549722 \\text{ m/s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the velocity scale is:\n$$u_{\\tau} \\approx 0.6455 \\text{ m/s}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless wall-unit coordinate, $y^+$:\n$$y^{+} = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (0.64549722)}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}$$\n$$y^{+} = \\frac{0.64549722 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}} = \\frac{0.64549722}{1.5} \\times 10^2 \\approx 43.033148$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the wall-unit coordinate is:\n$$y^{+} \\approx 43.03$$\n\nFinally, we discuss whether the computed $y^+$ value lies within the region where the logarithmic law of the wall is valid. The near-wall region of a high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer over a smooth wall is typically stratified based on the value of $y^+$:\n1.  **Viscous Sublayer:** For $y^{+} \\lesssim 5$, viscous stresses dominate over turbulent Reynolds stresses. The mean velocity profile is linear, given by $u^{+} = y^{+}$, where $u^{+}$ is the dimensionless velocity $u/u_{\\tau}$.\n2.  **Buffer Layer:** For $5 \\lesssim y^{+} \\lesssim 30$, both viscous and turbulent stresses are of comparable magnitude. This is a transitional region between the viscous sublayer and the logarithmic region.\n3.  **Logarithmic Region (Log-Law Region):** For $y^{+} \\gtrsim 30$ (and extending to a certain fraction of the total boundary layer thickness, e.g., $y/\\delta < 0.2$), turbulent stresses dominate. The mean velocity profile is described by the logarithmic law:\n    $$u^{+} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln(y^{+}) + B$$\n    where $\\kappa \\approx 0.41$ is the von Kármán constant and $B \\approx 5.0$ is an integration constant for smooth walls.\n\nOur calculated value is $y^{+} \\approx 43.03$. This value is greater than $30$, placing it squarely in the logarithmic region. Therefore, it is physically consistent and appropriate to apply the logarithmic law of the wall to estimate the mean velocity at the specified wall-normal distance of $y = 1$ mm under the given flow conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6455 & 43.03 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3375922"}, {"introduction": "The logarithmic law is a powerful tool, but its validity is restricted to a specific region of the boundary layer, typically for $y^+ \\gtrsim 30$.

Introduce wall units via the inner scaling $y^+ = y \\, u_\\tau/\\nu$ and $U^+ = U/u_\\tau$.

The friction velocity $u_\\tau$ controls the inner scaling $y^+$ itself, which implies a nonlinearity when solving for $u_\\tau$ given $U$ and $y_1$. If the first node lies in the viscous sublayer, replacing the linear relation with the logarithmic one produces an inconsistency. We quantify it by comparing the \"true\" wall shear stress, computed from a consistent near-wall relation, with the \"inferred\" wall shear stress obtained by inverting the logarithmic law.\n\nAlgorithmic steps grounded in these principles:\n\n1.

Emulate the standard wall function by solving for an inferred friction velocity $\\hat{u}_\\tau$ from the logarithmic relation imposed at $y_1$.

A robust numerical method such as the Brent bracketing method can be used to find the root in a wide interval (for instance, between a small positive lower bound and a large upper bound) because $g$ exhibits a sign change over such a range for physically plausible inputs.\n5.

Apply this procedure to the four test cases designed to probe distinct regions:\n   - $y_1^+ = 0.5$ (deep viscous sublayer, expected large inconsistency),\n   - $y_1^+ = 5$ (near the transition, the case of interest),\n   - $y_1^+ = 30$ (entry to the logarithmic region, consistency expected),\n   - $y_1^+ = 100$ (well within the logarithmic region, consistency expected).\n7.

Conversely, for $y_1^+ \\geq 30$, if $U$ is consistent with the logarithmic law, inverting the same law reproduces the correct $u_\\tau$ and thus yields negligible error in $\\tau_w$.

Friction velocity bias: $u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}} = (1+\\varepsilon)u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}$.\n\nWe now calculate the fractional bias in $C_f$ and $\\Delta p$.\n\nFractional bias in $C_f$:\nThe true and biased drag coefficients are $C_{f,\\text{true}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}}{U_{b,\\text{true}}}\\right)^{2}$ and $C_{f,\\text{bias}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}}}{U_{b,\\text{bias}}}\\right)^{2}$.\nThe fractional bias is:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{f,\\text{bias}} - C_{f,\\text{true}}}{C_{f,\\text{true}}} = \\frac{C_{f,\\text{bias}}}{C_{f,\\text{true}}} - 1 = \\frac{2 \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}}}{U_{b,\\text{bias}}}\\right)^{2}}{2 \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}}{U_{b,\\text{true}}}\\right)^{2}} - 1\n$$\nSubstituting the constraints $U_{b,\\text{bias}} = U_{b,\\text{true}}$ and $u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}} = (1+\\varepsilon)u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{f,\\text{bias}} - C_{f,\\text{true}}}{C_{f,\\text{true}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(1+\\varepsilon)u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}}{U_{b,\\text{true}}}\\right)^{2}}{\\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}}{U_{b,\\text{true}}}\\right)^{2}} - 1 = (1+\\varepsilon)^{2} - 1 = 1 + 2\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon^2 - 1 = 2\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon^2\n$$\n\nFractional bias in $\\Delta p$:\nThe pressure drop in the simulation, $\\Delta p_{\\text{bias}}$, must balance the wall shear stress computed by the biased model, $\\tau_{w,\\text{bias}} = \\rho u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}}^{2}$. Thus, $\\Delta p_{\\text{bias}} = \\frac{\\rho u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}}^{2} L}{h}$.

Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation (WMLES) with Constant Pressure Gradient**\n\nIn this modality, the mean pressure gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is held constant. The simulation evolves until a statistically steady state is reached, and the resulting bulk velocity $U_b$ is an outcome of the simulation.\n\nThe governing constraint is: $(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x})_{\\text{bias}} = (\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x})_{\\text{true}}$.\nFrom the mean momentum balance for fully developed channel flow, $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\tau_w}{h}$. This implies that the wall shear stress is also constant and equal to the true value:\n$$\n\\tau_{w,\\text{bias}} = -h \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)_{\\text{bias}} = -h \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)_{\\text{true}} = \\tau_{w,\\text{true}}\n$$\nThis means that the *actual* friction velocity in the biased simulation is identical to the true friction velocity, i.e., $u_{\\tau, \\text{actual}} = u_{\\tau, \\text{true}}$. Let's denote this common value by $u_{\\tau,0}$.\n\nFractional bias in $\\Delta p$:\nSince $\\Delta p = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} L$ and the pressure gradient is fixed, it immediately follows that $\\Delta p_{\\text{bias}} = \\Delta p_{\\text{true}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta p_{\\text{bias}} - \\Delta p_{\\text{true}}}{\\Delta p_{\\text{true}}} = 0\n$$\n\nFractional bias in $C_f$:\nThe bias $u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}} = (1+\\varepsilon)u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}$ is now interpreted as an error in the wall model's *internal logic*. The model uses a faulty $u_\\tau$ value to relate the wall stress to the resolved velocity field. The model enforces the log law using $u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}}$:\n$U_{\\text{model}}(y) = u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln\\left(\\frac{y u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}}}{\\nu}\\right) + B \\right]$.\nSubstituting $u_{\\tau,\\text{bias}} = (1+\\varepsilon)u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}$ (with $u_{\\tau,\\text{true}} = u_{\\tau,0}$ being the fixed, true friction velocity):\n$$\nU_{\\text{bias}}(y) = (1+\\varepsilon)u_{\\tau,\\text{true}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln\\left(\\frac{y(1+\\varepsilon)u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}}{\\nu}\\right) + B \\right]\n$$\nUsing $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $y^{+}_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{y u_{\\tau,\\text{true}}}{\\nu}$:\n$$\nU_{\\text{bias}}(y) = (1+\\varepsilon)u_{\\tau,\\text{true}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln(y^{+}_{\\text{true}}) + B\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln(1+\\varepsilon) \\right]\n$$\nThe term $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln(y^{+}_{\\text{true}}) + B\\right)$ is the true dimensionless velocity profile $U^{+}_{\\text{true}}(y)$.
