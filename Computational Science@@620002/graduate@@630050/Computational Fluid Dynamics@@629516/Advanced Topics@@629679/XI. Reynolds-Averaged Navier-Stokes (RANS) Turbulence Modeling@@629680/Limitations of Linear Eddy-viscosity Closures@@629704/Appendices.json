The diagonal components are:\n$$\nS_{11} = 2 \\sigma s\n$$\n$$\nS_{22} = -\\sigma s\n$$\n$$\nS_{33} = -\\sigma s\n$$\nThe off-diagonal components, $S_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$, are zero. The Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$, is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise. We can now compute the normal components of the Reynolds stress tensor, $r_{11}$, $r_{22}$, and $r_{33}$.\n\nFor the first normal stress component, $r_{11}$ (with $i=j=1$):\n$$\nr_{11} = \\frac{2}{3} k \\,\\delta_{11} - 2 \\,\\nu_{t} \\, S_{11} = \\frac{2}{3} k - 2 \\nu_{t} (2 \\sigma s) = \\frac{2}{3} k - 4 \\sigma \\nu_{t} s\n$$\nFor the second normal stress component, $r_{22}$ (with $i=j=2$):\n$$\nr_{22} = \\frac{2}{3} k \\,\\delta_{22} - 2 \\,\\nu_{t} \\, S_{22} = \\frac{2}{3} k - 2 \\nu_{t} (-\\sigma s) = \\frac{2}{3} k + 2 \\sigma \\nu_{t} s\n$$\nFor the third normal stress component, $r_{33}$ (with $i=j=3$):\n$$\nr_{33} = \\frac{2}{3} k \\,\\delta_{33} - 2 \\,\\nu_{t} \\, S_{33} = \\frac{2}{3} k - 2 \\nu_{t} (-\\sigma s) = \\frac{2}{3} k + 2 \\sigma \\nu_{t} s\n$$\nThe problem asks for the triple of normal stress ratios, $\\left(\\frac{r_{11}}{k} : \\frac{r_{22}}{k} : \\frac{r_{33}}{k}\\right)$. To find these, we divide each of the expressions above by the turbulent kinetic energy, $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{r_{11}}{k} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} k - 4 \\sigma \\nu_{t} s \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} - 4 \\sigma \\frac{\\nu_{t} s}{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r_{22}}{k} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} k + 2 \\sigma \\nu_{t} s \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\sigma \\frac{\\nu_{t} s}{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r_{33}}{k} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} k + 2 \\sigma \\nu_{t} s \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\sigma \\frac{\\nu_{t} s}{k}\n$$\nUsing the provided dimensionless parameter $r \\equiv \\frac{\\nu_t \\, s}{k}$, we can express these ratios in their final form:\n$$\n\\frac{r_{11}}{k} = \\frac{2}{3} - 4 \\sigma r\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r_{22}}{k} = \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\sigma r\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r_{33}}{k} = \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\sigma r\n$$\nThe requested triple is therefore:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{r_{11}}{k} : \\frac{r_{22}}{k} : \\frac{r_{33}}{k}\\right) = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} - 4 \\sigma r : \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\sigma r : \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\sigma r \\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Explanation of Model Limitations\n\nThe linear eddy-viscosity model's fundamental structure is responsible for its inability to accurately predict the anisotropy observed in axisymmetric flows. This can be understood by examining both realizability constraints and the model's inherent symmetry.\n\n**1. Realizability Violation:**\nA fundamental physical constraint, known as realizability, requires the Reynolds stress tensor $r_{ij}$ to be positive semi-definite. Since the tensor is diagonal in the principal axes, this implies that all its diagonal components (eigenvalues) must be non-negative: $r_{11} \\ge 0$, $r_{22} \\ge 0$, and $r_{33} \\ge 0$.\nLet's analyze these conditions for the two cases:\n- **Axisymmetric Contraction ($\\sigma = -1$):**\n  The conditions become $r_{11}/k = \\frac{2}{3} + 4r \\ge 0$ (always true since $r>0$) and $r_{22}/k = r_{33}/k = \\frac{2}{3} - 2r \\ge 0$. The second condition implies $r \\le \\frac{1}{3}$. If the strain rate is large enough such that $r > \\frac{1}{3}$, the model predicts negative normal stresses (negative kinetic energy components), which is physically impossible.\n- **Axisymmetric Expansion ($\\sigma = +1$):**\n  The conditions become $r_{11}/k = \\frac{2}{3} - 4r \\ge 0$ and $r_{22}/k = r_{33}/k = \\frac{2}{3} + 2r \\ge 0$. The first condition implies $r \\le \\frac{1}{6}$. Again, the model becomes unphysical for sufficiently large strain rates.\nThis demonstrates that the linear model breaks down quantitatively under strong mean strain.\n\n**2. Inherent Structural Flaw (Symmetry):**\nThe more profound failure of the linear model is structural. The Boussinesq hypothesis posits a linear relationship between the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, $a_{ij} = \\frac{r_{ij}}{k} - \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{ij}$, and the mean rate-of-strain tensor $S_{ij}$:\n$$\na_{ij} = -2\\frac{\\nu_t}{k}S_{ij}\n$$\nIn the case of axisymmetric flow, changing from expansion ($\\sigma=+1$) to contraction ($\\sigma=-1$) is equivalent to reversing the sign of the strain tensor, $S_{ij} \\to -S_{ij}$. Due to the linear relationship, the model predicts that the anisotropy tensor simply reverses its sign as well: $a_{ij} \\to -a_{ij}$.\n- For expansion ($\\sigma=+1$): $a_{11} = -4r$, $a_{22} = a_{33} = 2r$.\n- For contraction ($\\sigma=-1$): $a_{11} = 4r$, $a_{22} = a_{33} = -2r$.\n\nThis predicted response is perfectly symmetric. However, experimental data and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) show that real turbulence responds *asymmetrically* to expansion versus contraction. The structure of the turbulence, and thus the state of its anisotropy (e.g., its position on an anisotropy invariant map like the Lumley triangle), is fundamentally different for the two cases, not merely a reflection. For example, irrotational contraction drives turbulence towards a one-component (\"cigar-like\") state, while irrotational expansion drives it towards a two-component (\"pancake-like\") state.\n\nTo capture this observed asymmetric behavior, the constitutive relation for the stress anisotropy must be nonlinear. A more general expression for $a_{ij}$ is a tensor polynomial in $S_{ij}$ (and the rate-of-rotation tensor $W_{ij}$, though it is zero here). The next order term involves products of the strain-rate tensor:\n$$\na_{ij} \\propto C_1 S_{ij} + C_2 \\left(S_{ik}S_{kj} - \\frac{1}{3} S_{mn}S_{mn} \\delta_{ij}\\right) + \\dots\n$$\nThe crucial insight is that the quadratic term, $S_{ik}S_{kj}$, is an even function of $S_{ij}$. It does not change sign when $S_{ij} \\to -S_{ij}$. By including such nonlinear (even-powered) terms, the model can produce an asymmetric response for $a_{ij}$ when the sign of $S_{ij}$ is flipped. This is essential to correctly model the distinct physics of axisymmetric expansion and contraction, a feat the linear eddy-viscosity model cannot achieve by its very structure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} - 4 \\sigma r & \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\sigma r & \\frac{2}{3} + 2 \\sigma r \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3340486"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of anisotropy, this practice delves into the physics of energy redistribution in a homogeneous plane strain flow.

We focus on the production tensor, $P_{ij} = -(\\tau_{ik}S_{jk} + \\tau_{jk}S_{ik})$, and the pressure-strain tensor, $\\Pi_{ij} = \\overline{p'(\\partial_j u_i' + \\partial_i u_j')}$.\n\n$1$. **Production of Anisotropy**: The production term, $P_{ij}$, describes the rate at which the mean flow strain generates or destroys Reynolds stresses. For plane strain, the production of the normal stress components are $P_{11} = -2\\tau_{11}S$, $P_{22} = 2\\tau_{22}S$, and $P_{33} = 0$. This shows that the mean strain directly produces anisotropy in the normal stresses.\n\n$2$. **Pressure-Strain Redistribution**: The pressure-strain term, $\\Pi_{ij}$, does not change the total turbulent kinetic energy (since its trace $\\Pi_{kk}=0$ for incompressible flow) but redistributes it among the normal stress components, acting to drive the turbulence towards a more isotropic state. Crucially, the pressure field $p'$ is coupled to both the turbulent velocity fluctuations and the mean strain field. This coupling allows the pressure-strain term to transfer energy from components receiving production to those that are not.\n\n$3$. **The Fundamental Flaw**: In the case of plane strain, the production rate for the third normal stress component, $P_{33}$, is exactly zero because $S_{33}=0$. However, physics dictates (and RDT correctly models) that the pressure-strain term $\\Pi_{33}$ is non-zero. It channels energy—primarily from the compressive component $\\tau_{22}$ which experiences the largest production—into the other two components, including $\\tau_{33}$. Consequently, even though there is no direct production of $\\tau_{33}$, it evolves due to this redistribution mechanism. This results in a non-zero deviatoric stress $\\tau_{33}' \\neq 0$. Direct numerical simulations and experiments confirm that for plane strain, $\\tau_{33}$ does not remain equal to the mean normal stress $\\frac{2}{3}k$.\n\nThe linear eddy-viscosity model, by its very definition $\\tau_{ij}' = -2\\nu_t S_{ij}$, forces a direct, linear, and coaxial alignment between the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor $\\tau_{ij}'$ and the mean strain tensor $S_{ij}$. Since $S_{33}=0$ in plane strain, the model unconditionally predicts $\\tau_{33}' = 0$. This prediction is a direct contradiction of the physical role of the pressure-strain mechanism. By forcing $\\tau_{33}'$ to be zero, the model incorrectly represents the state of anisotropy and consequently yields incorrect ratios of the normal stresses, such as the value of $r$. RDT and more advanced nonlinear or Reynolds-stress transport models can capture this redistribution effect and predict physically realistic, non-zero values for $\\tau_{33}'$, leading to a value of $r$ closer to $-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2}\n$$", "id": "3340456"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice expands the critique to phenomena entirely invisible to the mean strain tensor, namely system rotation.

The mean strain-rate tensor $S_{ij}$ is defined as:\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a homogeneous plane shear flow with a mean velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{U} = (U_1, U_2, U_3) = (S y, 0, 0)$, where $S$ is the constant mean shear rate and the coordinates are $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$.\n\nWe first compute the components of the mean strain-rate tensor $S_{ij}$. The only non-zero gradient of the mean velocity is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial (S y)}{\\partial y} = S\n$$\nAll other gradients $\\partial U_i / \\partial x_j$ are zero.\nThe components of $S_{ij}$ are therefore:\n$$\nS_{11} = \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_1} = 0\n$$\n$$\nS_{22} = \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nS_{33} = \\frac{\\partial U_3}{\\partial x_3} = 0\n$$\nThe off-diagonal component $S_{12}$ is:\n$$\nS_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x_1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (S + 0) = \\frac{S}{2}\n$$\nBy symmetry, $S_{21} = S_{12} = \\frac{S}{2}$. All other off-diagonal components ($S_{13}, S_{23}$) are zero.\n\nNow, we use the Boussinesq hypothesis to find the predicted Reynolds shear stress, $\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}} = \\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{12} - 2 \\nu_t S_{12}\n$$\nSince $i=1$ and $j=2$, the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{12}$ is $0$. Substituting the value of $S_{12}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}} = 0 - 2 \\nu_t \\left( \\frac{S}{2} \\right) = - \\nu_t S\n$$\nThe eddy viscosity $\\nu_t$ is assumed to be a scalar property of the turbulence state, typically modeled as a function of $k$ and its dissipation rate $\\varepsilon$ (e.g., $\\nu_t = C_\\mu k^2/\\varepsilon$). In this standard formulation, $\\nu_t$ has no explicit dependence on the system rotation rate $\\Omega$. Therefore, the linear eddy-viscosity model prediction for the Reynolds shear stress, $\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}} = - \\nu_t S$, is indeed independent of $\\Omega$ and the rotation number $Ro$.\n\n### Part 2: Deduction of the True Reynolds Shear Stress Scaling\n\nThe linear eddy-viscosity model's insensitivity to rotation is a known flaw. Physically, the dynamics of turbulence in a rotating frame are affected by the Coriolis force. Although the Coriolis force does no net work on the flow, it redistributes energy among the Reynolds stress components, altering the turbulence structure.\n\nThe problem states that the governing equations are invariant under superposed rigid-body rotation. This implies that the turbulence dynamics should not depend on the mean shear $S$ and the system rotation $2\\Omega$ independently, but rather on a combination that represents the \"effective\" shear in the rotating frame. This effective shear is related to the absolute vorticity of the mean flow.\n\nThe vorticity of the mean flow is $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{U}$. For $\\boldsymbol{U} = (Sy, 0, 0)$, the only non-zero component is:\n$$\n\\omega_3 = \\frac{\\partial U_2}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial y} = 0 - S = -S\n$$\nSo, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (0, 0, -S)$. The system rotation provides a background vorticity of $2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = (0, 0, 2\\Omega)$.\nThe absolute vorticity vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{\\text{abs}} = \\boldsymbol{\\omega} + 2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = (0, 0, 2\\Omega - S)$.\n\nThe problem posits that for this flow configuration, the relevant physical quantity controlling the linear response of turbulence is the spanwise component of absolute vorticity, which is given as $\\omega_a = S - 2\\Omega$. This quantity represents the net vorticity that can tilt and stretch vortex lines to sustain turbulence production against the stabilizing/destabilizing effect of rotation.\n\nFollowing this physical argument, the Reynolds shear stress $\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}}$ should, to leading order, be proportional to this effective shear rate $\\omega_a$ rather than the mean shear rate $S$ alone. We can write this as:\n$$\n\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} \\propto \\omega_a \\implies \\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} = C (S - 2\\Omega)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant. To determine $C$, we use the condition that this expression must match the well-established result for the non-rotating case, i.e., in the limit $\\Omega \\rightarrow 0$. In the non-rotating limit, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Omega \\to 0} \\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} = C \\cdot S\n$$\nThe correct non-rotating limit is given by the standard Boussinesq model (which is accurate for simple shear), $\\tau_{12} = - \\nu_t S$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\nC \\cdot S = - \\nu_t S \\implies C = -\\nu_t\n$$\nThis assumes that $\\nu_t$ itself is evaluated at the same turbulence state (fixed $k, \\varepsilon$) for the sake of comparing the functional form of the stress-strain relationship. Substituting $C = -\\nu_t$ back into the proposed form yields:\n$$\n\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} = -\\nu_t (S - 2\\Omega)\n$$\nThis form correctly captures the suppression of shear stress for stable rotation ($S - 2\\Omega < S$) and correctly reduces to the non-rotating case.\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of the Overprediction Factor\n\nThe overprediction factor $F(Ro)$ of the linear eddy-viscosity model for stable rotation is defined as the ratio of the LEV model's prediction to the true physical shear stress:\n$$\nF(Ro) = \\frac{\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}}}{\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}}}\n$$\nUsing the results from Part 1 and Part 2:\n$$\n\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{LEV}} = - \\nu_t S\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{12}^{\\mathrm{true}} = - \\nu_t (S - 2\\Omega)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F(Ro)$:\n$$\nF(Ro) = \\frac{- \\nu_t S}{- \\nu_t (S - 2\\Omega)} = \\frac{S}{S - 2\\Omega}\n$$\nTo express this solely in terms of the rotation number $Ro = 2\\Omega/S$, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $S$:\n$$\nF(Ro) = \\frac{S/S}{(S - 2\\Omega)/S} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{2\\Omega}{S}}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $Ro$:\n$$\nF(Ro) = \\frac{1}{1 - Ro}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the overprediction factor as a function of the rotation number. For stable rotation ($Ro>0$), the denominator $1-Ro$ is less than $1$, so $F(Ro) > 1$, confirming that the LEV model overpredicts the magnitude of the Reynolds shear stress.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 - Ro}}\n$$", "id": "3340460"}]}
