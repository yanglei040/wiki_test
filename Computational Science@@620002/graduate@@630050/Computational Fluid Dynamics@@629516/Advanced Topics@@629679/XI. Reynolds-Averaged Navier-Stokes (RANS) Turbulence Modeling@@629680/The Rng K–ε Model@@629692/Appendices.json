A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Evaluation of Eddy Viscosity**\n\nThe first task is to derive the functional form for the eddy viscosity, $\\nu_{t}$, based on the turbulent kinetic energy, $k$, and its dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$, using dimensional analysis.\n\nThe dimensions of the relevant quantities are:\n- Eddy viscosity, $\\nu_{t}$: $[\\nu_{t}] = L^{2}T^{-1}$\n- Turbulent kinetic energy, $k$: $[k] = L^{2}T^{-2}$ (energy per unit mass)\n- Turbulent dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$: $[\\epsilon] = L^{2}T^{-3}$ (energy per unit mass per unit time)\n\nWe are to assume a relationship of the form:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} = C_{\\mu} k^{a} \\epsilon^{b}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\mu}$ is a dimensionless model constant, and $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined.\n\nEquating the dimensions on both sides of the equation:\n$$\n[L^{2}T^{-1}] = [L^{0}T^{0}] [L^{2}T^{-2}]^{a} [L^{2}T^{-3}]^{b}\n$$\n$$\n[L^{2}T^{-1}] = [L^{2a}T^{-2a}] [L^{2b}T^{-3b}]\n$$\n$$\n[L^{2}T^{-1}] = L^{2a+2b} T^{-2a-3b}\n$$\nThis yields a system of two linear equations for the exponents $a$ and $b$ by matching the powers of length ($L$) and time ($T$):\n1.  For length ($L$): $2 = 2a + 2b \\implies 1 = a + b$\n2.  For time ($T$): $-1 = -2a - 3b \\implies 1 = 2a + 3b$\n\nFrom equation (1), we express $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = 1 - b$.\nSubstituting this into equation (2):\n$$\n1 = 2(1-b) + 3b\n$$\n$$\n1 = 2 - 2b + 3b\n$$\n$$\n1 = 2 + b\n$$\n$$\nb = -1\n$$\nNow, we find $a$:\n$$\na = 1 - b = 1 - (-1) = 2\n$$\nThus, the exponents are $a=2$ and $b=-1$. The functional form for the eddy viscosity is:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} = C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^{2}}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nThis is the standard formula for eddy viscosity in k–ε models.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\nu_{t}$ using the given values:\n$k = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n$\\epsilon = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{3}$\n$C_{\\mu} = 0.0845$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} = 0.0845 \\times \\frac{(0.3)^{2}}{0.6} = 0.0845 \\times \\frac{0.09}{0.6} = 0.0845 \\times 0.15\n$$\n$$\n\\nu_{t} = 0.012675\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} \\approx 0.01268\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Change in Modeled Shear Stress**\n\nThe second task is to find the multiplicative factor by which the modeled shear stress magnitude, $\\tau$, changes when $C_{\\mu}$ is increased by $10\\%$.\n\nThe modeled shear stress is given by $\\tau = \\rho \\nu_{t} \\bar{S}$. Substituting the expression for $\\nu_{t}$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\rho \\left(C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^{2}}{\\epsilon}\\right) \\bar{S}\n$$\nLet the original values be denoted by $\\tau$ and $C_{\\mu}$. The new value of the constant, $C_{\\mu}'$, is an increase of $10\\%$ over the original value:\n$$\nC_{\\mu}' = C_{\\mu} \\times (1 + 0.10) = 1.1 C_{\\mu}\n$$\nThe problem states that all other quantities ($k$, $\\epsilon$, $\\rho$, $\\bar{S}$) remain fixed. The new shear stress, $\\tau'$, is:\n$$\n\\tau' = \\rho \\left(C_{\\mu}' \\frac{k^{2}}{\\epsilon}\\right) \\bar{S} = \\rho \\left( (1.1 C_{\\mu}) \\frac{k^{2}}{\\epsilon}\\right) \\bar{S}\n$$\nWe can rewrite $\\tau'$ in terms of $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau' = 1.1 \\left[ \\rho \\left(C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^{2}}{\\epsilon}\\right) \\bar{S} \\right] = 1.1 \\tau\n$$\nThe multiplicative factor is the ratio of the new shear stress to the original shear stress:\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = \\frac{\\tau'}{\\tau} = \\frac{1.1 \\tau}{\\tau} = 1.1\n$$\nThe problem asks for this factor as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{Factor} = 1.10\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01268 & 1.10 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3379914"}, {"introduction": "A key theoretical advantage of the RNG k–ε model is its ability to account for the effects of rapid mean strain on turbulence, an area where the standard model often falters.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n**1. Dimensional Analysis of $\\eta$**\n\nThe dimensionless parameter $\\eta$ is defined as $\\eta = S k / \\epsilon$. We will determine the dimensions of each term on the right-hand side using the fundamental dimensions of length, $L$, and time, $T$.\n\n- The magnitude of the mean rate-of-strain, $S$, is the gradient of a velocity field. Velocity has dimensions $L T^{-1}$ and the gradient operation corresponds to dividing by a length dimension, $L$. Therefore, the dimensions of $S$ are:\n$$[S] = \\frac{L T^{-1}}{L} = T^{-1}$$\n\n- The turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass, $k$, has dimensions of velocity squared. As velocity has dimensions $L T^{-1}$, the dimensions of $k$ are:\n$$[k] = (L T^{-1})^{2} = L^{2} T^{-2}$$\n\n- The turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$, is the rate of change of $k$ per unit mass. This means it has the dimensions of $k$ divided by time, $T$. Therefore, the dimensions of $\\epsilon$ are:\n$$[\\epsilon] = \\frac{[k]}{T} = \\frac{L^{2} T^{-2}}{T} = L^{2} T^{-3}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these dimensions into the definition of $\\eta$:\n$$[\\eta] = \\frac{[S][k]}{[\\epsilon]} = \\frac{(T^{-1}) (L^{2} T^{-2})}{L^{2} T^{-3}}$$\n\nCombining the terms in the numerator:\n$$[\\eta] = \\frac{L^{2} T^{-1-2}}{L^{2} T^{-3}} = \\frac{L^{2} T^{-3}}{L^{2} T^{-3}}$$\n\nCanceling the terms from the numerator and denominator yields:\n$$[\\eta] = L^{2-2} T^{-3-(-3)} = L^{0} T^{0}$$\nSince the exponents of both fundamental dimensions $L$ and $T$ are zero, the parameter $\\eta$ is dimensionless.\n\n**2. Physical Interpretation of $\\eta$**\n\nWe are asked to interpret $\\eta$ in terms of two characteristic time scales: the mean-strain time scale, $\\tau_{s} = 1/S$, and the turbulence time scale, $\\tau_{t} = k/\\epsilon$.\n\nFirst, let us express $\\eta$ as a ratio of these two time scales. Starting with the definition of $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{S k}{\\epsilon}$$\nWe can rewrite this expression as:\n$$\\eta = S \\left(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1/S)} \\left(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $\\tau_{s}$ and $\\tau_{t}$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{\\tau_{t}}{\\tau_{s}}$$\n\nThe physical interpretation of this ratio is as follows:\n- $\\tau_{s} = 1/S$ is the characteristic time scale of the mean flow. It represents the time it takes for the mean flow to undergo significant deformation or strain. A large strain rate $S$ corresponds to a short time scale, indicating rapid changes in the mean flow structure.\n- $\\tau_{t} = k/\\epsilon$ is the characteristic time scale of the turbulence. It is often called the eddy turnover time for the large, energy-containing eddies. It represents the time scale over which turbulent kinetic energy is transferred from the largest eddies down the energy cascade to be dissipated. It is a measure of the \"lifetime\" of the large-scale turbulent motions.\n\nThe ratio $\\eta = \\tau_{t} / \\tau_{s}$ thus compares the time scale of the turbulence to the time scale of the mean flow.\n- If $\\eta \\ll 1$, then $\\tau_{t} \\ll \\tau_{s}$. This indicates that the turbulence evolves much faster than the mean flow. The turbulence can be considered to be in a state of local equilibrium, where production and dissipation of turbulent energy are nearly balanced, and the turbulence adapts almost instantaneously to changes in the mean flow.\n- If $\\eta \\gg 1$, then $\\tau_{t} \\gg \\tau_{s}$. This indicates that the mean flow is changing very rapidly compared to the response time of the turbulence. The turbulence \"lags\" behind the mean flow deformation, and the assumption of local equilibrium is no longer valid. In such rapidly strained flows, production of turbulence can significantly exceed its dissipation. The RNG k–ε model is specifically formulated to account for these non-equilibrium effects through terms that are functions of $\\eta$.\n\n**3. Calculation of $\\eta$**\n\nWe are given the following values for a homogeneous shear flow region:\n- $S = 75\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $k = 0.08\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-2}$\n- $\\epsilon = 3.0\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-3}$\n\nWe use the definition of $\\eta$ to compute its value:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{S k}{\\epsilon}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{(75) (0.08)}{3.0}$$\nFirst, we compute the product in the numerator:\n$$75 \\times 0.08 = 6.0$$\nThen, we perform the division:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{6.0}{3.0} = 2.0$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The predicted decay exponent is:\n$$\nn_{\\text{RNG}} = \\frac{1}{1.68 - 1} = \\frac{1}{0.68} \\approx 1.470588...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $n_{\\text{RNG}} = 1.471$.\n\nFor the standard k–ε model, the coefficient is $C_{\\epsilon 2} = 1.92$.

The long-time asymptotic decay of such turbulence is governed by the behavior of the energy spectrum $E(\\kappa)$ at the largest scales (wavenumber $\\kappa \\to 0$). The nature of this spectrum is determined by the initial conditions of the flow, which in turn determines which, if any, large-scale quantities are invariant during the decay.\nTwo principal theoretical decay laws exist:\n1.  **Saffman Turbulence**: Characterized by the Saffman invariant, corresponding to an initial energy spectrum $E(\\kappa) \\sim \\kappa^2$ as $\\kappa \\to 0$. This theory predicts a decay exponent of $n = 6/5 = 1.2$.\n2.  **Batchelor Turbulence**: Characterized by the Loitsyansky integral invariant, corresponding to $E(\\kappa) \\sim \\kappa^4$ as $\\kappa \\to 0$. This theory predicts a decay exponent of $n = 10/7 \\approx 1.429$.\n\nDNS studies have confirmed that the decay exponent depends on the initial conditions and generally falls within the range predicted by these theories.\n- The RNG model's prediction, $n_{\\text{RNG}} \\approx 1.471$, is remarkably close to the theoretical value for Batchelor turbulence ($n=10/7 \\approx 1.429$). This agreement is a known success of the RNG model, reflecting its derivation from more fundamental theoretical physics principles which capture this asymptotic state with high fidelity.\n- The standard model's prediction, $n_{\\text{Std}} \\approx 1.087$, is significantly lower. It is closer to, but still below, the exponent for Saffman turbulence ($n=1.2$). The constants in the standard model were empirically calibrated to provide reasonable performance across a wide range of flows, particularly wall-bounded and free shear flows, rather than being optimized for this specific case of decaying isotropic turbulence. Consequently, its prediction for this canonical flow is less accurate than that of the RNG model.\n\nIn summary, the RNG model provides a decay exponent that is in good agreement with the established theory for turbulence conserving the Loitsyansky integral, whereas the standard model predicts a much faster decay rate (a smaller $n$ means $k$ decays more slowly, $t^{-1.087}$ vs $t^{-1.471}$) that lies at the low end of the physically observed range.\nThe requested numerical values are the pair of exponents for the RNG and standard models, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.471 & 1.087 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3379910"}]}
