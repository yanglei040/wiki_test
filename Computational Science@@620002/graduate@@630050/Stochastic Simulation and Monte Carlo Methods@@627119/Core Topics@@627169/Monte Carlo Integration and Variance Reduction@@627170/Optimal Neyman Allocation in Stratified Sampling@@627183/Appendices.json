All necessary data and constraints are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is a standard application of optimization in stratified sampling theory. Therefore, it is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the sample allocation $(n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4)$ that minimizes the variance of the stratified mean estimator, subject to a fixed total sample size $n$.\n\nFirst, let us define the key quantities. The total population is partitioned into $H$ strata. Let $N_h$ be the size of stratum $h$, and $N = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} N_h$ be the total population size. The stratum weight is defined as $W_h = N_h / N$. The population mean $\\mu$ can be expressed as a weighted average of the stratum means $\\mu_h$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{N_h}{N} \\mu_h = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\mu_h\n$$\nThe stratified estimator for the population mean, $\\hat{\\mu}_{st}$, is constructed by taking a simple random sample of size $n_h$ from each stratum $h$ and computing the sample mean $\\bar{y}_h$. The estimator is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_{st} = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\bar{y}_h\n$$\nThis estimator is unbiased. Using the linearity of expectation and the fact that an in-stratum sample mean $\\bar{y}_h$ is an unbiased estimator of the stratum mean $\\mu_h$ (i.e., $E[\\bar{y}_h] = \\mu_h$):\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\mu}_{st}] = E\\left[\\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\bar{y}_h\\right] = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h E[\\bar{y}_h] = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\mu_h = \\mu\n$$\nThe variance of the stratified estimator is derived based on the independence of samples across strata. This allows the variance of the sum to be the sum of the variances:\n$$\nV(\\hat{\\mu}_{st}) = V\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h \\bar{y}_h\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} V(W_h \\bar{y}_h) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} W_h^2 V(\\bar{y}_h)\n$$\nThe variance of the sample mean $\\bar{y}_h$ from a stratum of size $N_h$ with standard deviation $S_h$ is given by $V(\\bar{y}_h) = \\frac{S_h^2}{n_h} \\left(1 - \\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)$, where the term $\\left(1 - \\frac{n_h}{N_h}\\right)$ is the finite population correction (FPC). The problem specifies to ignore the FPC, which is equivalent to assuming sampling is done with replacement or that the sampling fractions $n_h/N_h$ are negligible. This yields the approximation:\n$$\nV(\\bar{y}_h) \\approx \\frac{S_h^2}{n_h}\n$$\nThus, the variance to be minimized, which we denote by $V$, is:\n$$\nV(n_1, \\dots, n_H) = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h}\n$$\nThe optimization problem is to minimize this variance subject to the constraint of a fixed total sample size $n$:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize} \\quad V = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\sum_{h=1}^{H} n_h = n\n$$\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

The problem is well-posed: it is a convex optimization problem (the objective function is a sum of convex functions $1/n_h$ and the constraint domain is linear) which guarantees a unique minimum. The notation is standard and all terms are clearly defined. The problem is self-contained and consistent. No flaws are identified. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Optimal Allocation\nWe need to minimize the variance $V = \\sum_{h=1}^{L} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h}$ subject to the cost constraint $\\sum_{h=1}^{L} c_h n_h = C$. The sample sizes $n_h$ must be positive. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(n_1, \\ldots, n_L, \\lambda) = \\sum_{h=1}^{L} \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h} + \\lambda \\left( \\left( \\sum_{h=1}^{L} c_h n_h \\right) - C \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nTo find the minimum, we compute the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $n_h$ and set them to zero. These are the first-order optimality conditions. For each $h \\in \\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_h} = -\\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h^2} + \\lambda c_h = 0\n$$\nSince $W_h, S_h, c_h$ are all positive and we are looking for a solution with $n_h > 0$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$\n\\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{n_h^2} = \\lambda c_h \\implies n_h^2 = \\frac{W_h^2 S_h^2}{\\lambda c_h}\n$$\nTaking the square root (we need $n_h > 0$), we get:\n$$\nn_h = \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sqrt{c_h}}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the optimal sample size $n_h^*$ is proportional to $W_h S_h / \\sqrt{c_h}$. To find the constant of proportionality (which depends on $\\lambda$), we substitute this expression for $n_h$ back into the cost constraint equation:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{L} c_j n_j = C \\implies \\sum_{j=1}^{L} c_j \\left( \\frac{W_j S_j}{\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sqrt{c_j}} \\right) = C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} \\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j} = C\n$$\nSolving for $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ back into the equation for $n_h$:\n$$\nn_h^* = \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sqrt{c_h}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\frac{W_h S_h}{\\sqrt{c_h}} \\cdot \\frac{C}{\\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}}\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form expression for the optimal allocation for each stratum $h$:\n$$\nn_h^* = C \\frac{W_h S_h / \\sqrt{c_h}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Limit of $n_k^*$\nWe are asked to find the limit of $n_k^*$ as the cost $c_k$ for a specific stratum $k$ diverges, i.e., $c_k \\to \\infty$, while all other costs $c_j$ ($j \\neq k$) and all $W_j, S_j$ and $C$ remain fixed.\n\nThe expression for $n_k^*$ is:\n$$\nn_k^*(c_k) = C \\frac{W_k S_k / \\sqrt{c_k}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}}\n$$\nTo analyze the limit, we can split the sum in the denominator to isolate the term containing $c_k$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{L} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j} = \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq k} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j} \\right) + W_k S_k \\sqrt{c_k}\n$$\nLet's define a constant $A = \\sum_{j \\neq k} W_j S_j \\sqrt{c_j}$. Since all $W_j, S_j, c_j$ for $j \\neq k$ are fixed positive values, $A$ is a positive constant. Also, let $B = W_k S_k$, which is another positive constant. The expression for $n_k^*$ becomes:\n$$\nn_k^*(c_k) = C \\frac{B / \\sqrt{c_k}}{A + B \\sqrt{c_k}}\n$$\nTo simplify for the limit evaluation, we can write this as:\n$$\nn_k^*(c_k) = \\frac{C B}{ \\sqrt{c_k} (A + B \\sqrt{c_k}) } = \\frac{C B}{A \\sqrt{c_k} + B c_k}\n$$\nWe need to evaluate the limit of this expression as $c_k \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{c_k \\to \\infty} n_k^*(c_k) = \\lim_{c_k \\to \\infty} \\frac{C B}{A \\sqrt{c_k} + B c_k}\n$$\nThe numerator is the positive constant $CB$.\nThe denominator is the sum of two terms, $A \\sqrt{c_k}$ and $B c_k$. As $c_k \\to \\infty$, both terms go to infinity. Thus, the entire denominator goes to infinity:\n$$\n\\lim_{c_k \\to \\infty} (A \\sqrt{c_k} + B c_k) = \\infty\n$$\nTherefore, the limit of the expression is a constant divided by infinity, which is zero.\n$$\n\\lim_{c_k \\to \\infty} n_k^*(c_k) = 0\n$$\nThis result indicates that as the cost of sampling in a particular stratum becomes prohibitively expensive, the optimal allocation dictates that the number of samples taken from that stratum should approach zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3324873"}]}
