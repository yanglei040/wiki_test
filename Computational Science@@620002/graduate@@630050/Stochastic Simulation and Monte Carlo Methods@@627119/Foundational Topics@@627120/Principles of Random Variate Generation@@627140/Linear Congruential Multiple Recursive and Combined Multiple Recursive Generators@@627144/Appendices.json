The orbit starting from $0$ is $(0, 1, 6, 31, \\dots, 19)$. This orbit has length $32$. Since the state space contains exactly $32$ elements, $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 31\\}$, this single orbit exhausts the entire state space. Therefore, the state graph consists of a single cycle of length $32$.\n\n#### 2. Algebraic Analysis\n\nThe second part of the task is to derive this result through algebraic reasoning. First, we find a general expression for the $n$-th iterate of the map $f(x) = ax+c$.\n$f^1(x) = ax+c$\n$f^2(x) = a(ax+c)+c = a^2x + ac + c = a^2x + c(a+1)$\n$f^3(x) = a(a^2x+c(a+1))+c = a^3x + c(a^2+a) + c = a^3x + c(a^2+a+1)$\nBy induction, the general formula for the $n$-th iterate is:\n$$f^n(x) = a^n x + c \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^i$$\nThe sum is a geometric series, which can be written as $S_n(a) = \\frac{a^n-1}{a-1}$. This closed form is only valid in a field; in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_m$, it is only valid if $a-1$ is a unit (i.e., invertible) modulo $m$. In our case, $a=5$ and $m=32$, so $a-1=4$. Since $\\gcd(4, 32)=4 \\neq 1$, $4$ is not invertible modulo $32$. We must therefore reason directly with the sum or be careful with division.\n\nA state $x$ is part of a cycle of length dividing $n$ if and only if it is a fixed point of the map $f^n$, that is, $f^n(x) \\equiv x \\pmod m$.\n$$a^n x + c \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^i \\equiv x \\pmod m$$\n$$(a^n-1)x + c \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^i \\equiv 0 \\pmod m$$\nWith the given parameters $(m,a,c)=(32,5,1)$, the condition becomes:\n$$(5^n-1)x + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 5^i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$$\nWe need to find the number of solutions $x$ for this congruence for various values of $n$. The length of any cycle must divide the total number of states, which is $32$. The possible cycle lengths are divisors of $32$: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32$.\n\nLet's test for fixed points ($n=1$):\n$(5^1-1)x + \\sum_{i=0}^{0} 5^i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32} \\implies 4x + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$.\nThis congruence $4x \\equiv -1 \\equiv 31 \\pmod{32}$ has no solution, because $\\gcd(4, 32) = 4$, and $4$ does not divide $31$. Thus, there are no fixed points, meaning no cycles of length $1$.\n\nTo analyze the terms for general $n$, we utilize the property that for $a=5$, we have $v_2(a-1)=v_2(4)=2$. For $k \\ge 1$, the lifting-the-exponent lemma implies $v_2(5^{2^k}-1) = v_2(5-1) + k = 2+k$. Here $v_2(N)$ is the exponent of the highest power of $2$ that divides $N$.\n\nLet's test $n=32=2^5$.\nThe coefficient of $x$ is $5^{32}-1$. Using the property with $k=5$, $v_2(5^{32}-1) = 2+5=7$. This means $5^{32}-1$ is divisible by $2^7=128$, and therefore $5^{32}-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$.\nThe constant term is $S_{32}(5) = \\sum_{i=0}^{31} 5^i = \\frac{5^{32}-1}{5-1} = \\frac{5^{32}-1}{4}$.\nSince $v_2(5^{32}-1) = 7$, we have $v_2(S_{32}(5)) = v_2(5^{32}-1) - v_2(4) = 7-2=5$.\nSo, $S_{32}(5)$ is divisible by $2^5=32$. $S_{32}(5) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$.\nThe condition for $n=32$ becomes:\n$$0 \\cdot x + 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$$\nThis is true for all $32$ values of $x \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 31\\}$. This proves that every state in the space is part of a cycle whose length divides $32$.\n\nNow, we must check for smaller cycle lengths to determine the exact lengths. The largest proper divisor of $32$ is $16$. Let's test $n=16=2^4$.\nThe coefficient of $x$ is $5^{16}-1$. Using the property with $k=4$, $v_2(5^{16}-1) = 2+4=6$. This means $5^{16}-1$ is divisible by $2^6=64$, so $5^{16}-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$.\nThe constant term is $S_{16}(5) = \\frac{5^{16}-1}{4}$.\nSince $v_2(5^{16}-1) = 6$, we have $v_2(S_{16}(5)) = v_2(5^{16}-1) - v_2(4) = 6-2=4$.\nSo, $S_{16}(5)$ is divisible by $2^4=16$, but its quotient by $16$ is odd. Thus, $S_{16}(5) \\equiv 16 \\pmod{32}$.\nThe condition for $n=16$ becomes:\n$$0 \\cdot x + 16 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$$\nThis congruence, $16 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{32}$, is false. There are no solutions for $x$. This means there are no states $x$ that satisfy $f^{16}(x)=x$.\n\nThis implies that there are no cycles of any length that divides $16$ (i.e., no cycles of length $1, 2, 4, 8, 16$).\nSince every state lies on a cycle whose length divides $32$, and no state lies on a cycle whose length divides $16$, the length $\\ell$ of the cycle for any state must satisfy $\\ell | 32$ and $\\ell \\nmid 16$. The only such positive integer is $\\ell=32$.\nTherefore, all states must lie on cycles of length exactly $32$. As there are $32$ states in total, they must form a single cycle of length $32$. This confirms the empirical result.\n\nThe cycle structure consists of one cycle of length $\\ell_1 = 32$.\n\nThe cycle-length generating polynomial is defined as $C(t) = \\sum_j t^{\\ell_j}$, where the sum is over all distinct cycles. In this case, there is only one cycle ($j=1$) with length $\\ell_1=32$.\nThus, the polynomial is $C(t) = t^{32}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{t^{32}}$$", "id": "3318070"}, {"introduction": "Real-world LCGs often use large, composite moduli, making direct analysis difficult.

Analysis of the sequence modulo 5**\n\nThe recurrence for $y_n = x_n \\pmod{5}$ is obtained by taking the original recurrence modulo $5$:\n$$y_{n+1} \\equiv 8 y_n + 5 \\pmod{5}$$\nSimplifying the coefficients modulo $5$, we have $8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$ and $5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. The recurrence becomes:\n$$y_{n+1} \\equiv 3 y_n \\pmod{5}$$\nThis is a multiplicative congruential generator. The problem specifies that the seed $x_0$ must satisfy $x_0 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which means $y_0 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nIf $y_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, the sequence would be $0, 0, 0, \\dots$, a fixed point with period $1$. By excluding this case, we are considering initial states $y_0 \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThe period $p_5$ of this sequence is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $y_{n+k} \\equiv y_n \\pmod{5}$ for all $n \\ge 0$. Since $y_n \\equiv 3^n y_0 \\pmod{5}$, this is equivalent to finding the smallest $k>0$ such that $3^k y_0 \\equiv y_0 \\pmod{5}$. As $y_0 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, it is invertible modulo $5$, so we must find the smallest $k>0$ such that $3^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. This is the multiplicative order of $3$ in the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^*$.\nLet's compute the powers of $3$ modulo $5$:\n$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n$3^3 \\equiv 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$\n$3^4 \\equiv 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\nThe multiplicative order of $3$ modulo $5$ is $4$.

Analysis of the sequence modulo 9**\n\nThe recurrence for $z_n = x_n \\pmod{9}$ is:\n$$z_{n+1} \\equiv 8 z_n + 5 \\pmod{9}$$\nSimplifying the coefficient $a=8$, we note that $8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{9}$. The recurrence becomes:\n$$z_{n+1} \\equiv -z_n + 5 \\pmod{9}$$\nThe problem specifies the constraint $x_0 \\not\\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$, which means $z_0 \\not\\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$.\nLet's first search for any fixed points of this recurrence. A fixed point $z$ must satisfy $z \\equiv -z + 5 \\pmod{9}$.\n$$2z \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$$\nTo solve for $z$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $9$. Since $2 \\times 5 = 10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$, the inverse of $2$ is $5$.\nMultiplying by $5$:\n$$z \\equiv 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$$\nSo, $z=7$ is the unique fixed point of this recurrence. If $z_0 = 7$, the sequence would be $7, 7, 7, \\dots$, having a period of $1$. The constraint $z_0 \\not\\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$ explicitly prevents the sequence from starting at this fixed point.\nNow let's examine the behavior for any $z_0 \\not\\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$. We compute the first few iterates:\n$$z_1 \\equiv -z_0 + 5 \\pmod{9}$$\n$$z_2 \\equiv -z_1 + 5 \\equiv -(-z_0 + 5) + 5 \\equiv z_0 - 5 + 5 \\equiv z_0 \\pmod{9}$$\nSince $z_2 \\equiv z_0 \\pmod{9}$, the period of the sequence must divide $2$. The period can be either $1$ or $2$.\nThe period is $1$ if and only if $z_1 \\equiv z_0$, which corresponds to the fixed point case $z_0 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$. As this case is excluded by the problem's constraints, we must have $z_1 \\not\\equiv z_0$.\nTherefore, for any $z_0 \\not\\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$, the sequence $\\{z_n\\}$ is of the form $z_0, z_1, z_0, z_1, \\dots$ with $z_0 \\neq z_1$. The period of this sequence is $p_9 = 2$.\n\n**3. Reconciliation via CRT**\n\nWe have found the periods of the component sequences to be $p_5 = 4$ and $p_9 = 2$. The period $p$ of the LCG sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ modulo $45$ is the least common multiple of these component periods:\n$$p = \\text{lcm}(p_5, p_9) = \\text{lcm}(4, 2)$$\nThe least common multiple of $4$ and $2$ is $4$.\n$$p = 4$$\nThus, for any initial seed $x_0$ that satisfies the stated conditions, the sequence generated by the LCG will enter a cycle of period $4$.

For an LCG, the sequence of $t$-tuples of consecutive outputs, $(u_i, u_{i+1}, \\dots, u_{i+t-1})$, does not fill the $t$-dimensional hypercube $[0,1)^t$ uniformly. Instead, all points lie on a lattice structure, which can be visualized as a set of parallel hyperplanes.\n\nA poor generator will have large gaps between these hyperplanes in some dimension $t$, indicating a lack of uniformity that can severely bias the results of a stochastic simulation sensitive to correlations in that dimension. The quality of the generator is therefore determined by the coarseness of its lattice structure.\n\nThe spectral test quantifies this coarseness. The maximal distance between adjacent hyperplanes in dimension $t$, which we can denote as $\\Delta_t(a)$, is inversely related to the length of the shortest non-zero vector, $v_t(a)$, in the corresponding dual lattice. The precise relationship is $\\Delta_t(a) = 1/v_t(a)$. Consequently, to ensure the smallest possible gaps and thus the best uniformity in dimension $t$, one must seek a multiplier $a$ that yields the largest possible value for $v_t(a)$.\n\nA generator is considered useful only if it exhibits good uniformity across *all* dimensions of interest. The quality of a generator is limited by its performance in its worst-performing dimension. An LCG that is excellent in dimensions $t=2, 3, 4$ but exhibits large gaps (a small $v_t(a)$) in dimension $t=5$ is a poor generator overall. This \"weakest link\" principle dictates the evaluation criterion.\n\nFor a given multiplier $a$, we should first identify its worst-case performance across the specified range of dimensions, $t \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}$. The worst-case performance corresponds to the smallest spectral score, $\\min_{t \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}} v_t(a)$. To select the best overall generator from a set of candidates, we should choose the one whose worst-case performance is as good as possible. This leads to the scientifically justified \"maximin\" criterion: select the multiplier $a$ that maximizes the minimum spectral score.\n$$\n\\text{Select } a = \\arg\\max_{a \\in \\{a_1, a_2\\}} \\left( \\min_{t \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}} v_t(a) \\right)\n$$\nTo apply this criterion, we must use the standard published values for the squared spectral test scores, $v_t^2(a)$, for the given multipliers with modulus $m = 2^{31}-1$. These values are readily available in authoritative sources such as D. E. Knuth's \"The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2\" and review articles by P. L'Ecuyer. Note that comparing the minimum of $v_t^2(a)$ is equivalent to comparing the minimum of $v_t(a)$.\n\nFor $a_1 = 16807$:\n$v_2^2(a_1) = 282475250$\n$v_3^2(a_1) = 826486$\n$v_4^2(a_1) = 35313$\n$v_5^2(a_1) = 2490$\n$v_6^2(a_1) = 2030$\nThe minimum squared score is $\\min_{t \\in \\{2,\\dots,6\\}} v_t^2(a_1) = 2030$.\n\nFor $a_2 = 48271$:\n$v_2^2(a_2) = 2330192882$\n$v_3^2(a_2) = 932506$\n$v_4^2(a_2) = 31549$\n$v_5^2(a_2) = 11114$\n$v_6^2(a_2) = 5129$\nThe minimum squared score is $\\min_{t \\in \\{2,\\dots,6\\}} v_t^2(a_2) = 5129$.\n\nApplying the maximin criterion: We compare the minimum scores.\n$$\n\\min_{t} v_t^2(a_1) = 2030\n$$\n$$\n\\min_{t} v_t^2(a_2) = 5129\n$$\nSince $5129 > 2030$, we have $\\min_t v_t(a_2) > \\min_t v_t(a_1)$. The maximin criterion selects the multiplier $a_2 = 48271$ as it provides better worst-case performance over the dimensions considered.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. Maximize the worst-case spectral score over the given dimensions: select the multiplier $a$ that maximizes $\\min_{t \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}} v_t(a)$. Under standard published spectral test results for $m=2^{31}-1$, this criterion selects $a=48271$ over $a=16807$.\nThis option correctly identifies the scientifically justified maximin criterion derived from first principles. It also correctly applies this criterion to the specified multipliers, concluding that $a=48271$ is the better choice. Our calculation confirms this result.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Maximize the average largest interplane spacing across the given dimensions: select the multiplier $a$ that maximizes $\\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{t \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}} \\Delta_t(a)$, where $\\Delta_t(a)$ denotes the largest interplane spacing in dimension $t$. Under this criterion for $m=2^{31}-1$, select $a=16807$.\nThis criterion is scientifically unsound. The largest interplane spacing $\\Delta_t(a)$ is a measure of non-uniformity; a smaller value is better. Therefore, a valid criterion would seek to minimize spacings, not maximize them. Maximizing the average spacing selects for a generator that is, on average, worse. Furthermore, averaging can mask critically poor performance in a single dimension.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Maximize the best-case spectral score: select the multiplier $a$ that maximizes $\\max_{t \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}} v_t(a)$. Applying this to $m=2^{31}-1$ selects $a=16807$.\nThis criterion is scientifically unjustified. The overall quality of a generator is limited by its worst dimension (weakest link), not its best. A generator could have an exceptionally high score in one dimension but be unacceptably poor in another. This criterion ignores the most important aspect of multi-dimensional uniformity. Additionally, the application is factually incorrect. Using the published data, $\\max_t v_t^2(a_1) \\approx 2.82 \\times 10^8$ while $\\max_t v_t^2(a_2) \\approx 2.33 \\times 10^9$. This criterion would therefore select $a_2=48271$, not $a_1=16807$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Ignore higher dimensions and focus on low-dimensional projections: select the multiplier $a$ that maximizes $\\min_{t \\in \\{2,3,4\\}} v_t(a)$, thereby choosing $a=16807$ for $m=2^{31}-1$.\nThis criterion is a truncated, and thus scientifically weak, version of the correct maximin criterion. While low-dimensional uniformity is crucial, there is no justification for arbitrarily ignoring available data for higher dimensions ($t=5, 6$), where critical flaws might exist. In fact, the worst-case score for $a_1=16807$ occurs at $t=6$. Ignoring this dimension leads to an incomplete and potentially misleading assessment. While the calculation within the option is correct (for $t \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, $\\min v_t^2(a_1) = 35313$ and $\\min v_t^2(a_2) = 31549$, so $a_1$ is chosen), the criterion itself is not scientifically robust.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3318052"}]}
