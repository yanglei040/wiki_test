The scenario is a standard application of resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to tokamak plasmas. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\n1) Derivation of the relationship between loop voltage, plasma current, and conductivity.\n\nThe problem states that under the given assumptions (steady, axisymmetric, resistive MHD limit, with negligible parallel flow and negligible parallel components of the Hall, pressure gradient, and electron inertia terms after flux-surface averaging), the generalized Ohm's law reduces to a balance between the parallel electric field, $E_\\parallel$, and resistive friction. This can be expressed as:\n$$E_\\parallel(r) = \\eta_\\parallel(r) J_\\parallel(r)$$\nIn a large-aspect-ratio, circular-cross-section tokamak, the toroidal direction (denoted by the coordinate $\\phi$) is approximately parallel to the magnetic field lines, especially near the magnetic axis. Thus, we can approximate $E_\\parallel \\approx E_\\phi$ and $J_\\parallel \\approx J_\\phi$. The current density $J_\\phi$ is the function $j(r)$ mentioned in the problem statement. The resistivity $\\eta_\\parallel$ is the function $\\eta(r)$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$E_\\phi = \\eta(r) j(r)$$\nThe toroidal electric field $E_\\phi$ is induced by the central solenoid (transformer) and is assumed to be uniform across the plasma cross-section. The loop voltage, $V_{\\text{loop}}$, is defined as the line integral of the electric field once around the torus at the major radius $R_0$:\n$$V_{\\text{loop}} = \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = E_\\phi \\cdot (2\\pi R_0)$$\nFrom this, we can express the constant toroidal electric field in terms of the loop voltage:\n$$E_\\phi = \\frac{V_{\\text{loop}}}{2\\pi R_0}$$\nSubstituting this back into the simplified Ohm's law gives an expression for the toroidal current density profile $j(r)$:\n$$j(r) = \\frac{E_\\phi}{\\eta(r)} = \\frac{1}{\\eta(r)} \\frac{V_{\\text{loop}}}{2\\pi R_0}$$\nThe total plasma current, $I_p$, is the integral of the current density $j(r)$ over the poloidal cross-sectional area $S = \\pi a^2$:\n$$I_p = \\int_S j(r) \\, dS$$\nSubstituting the expression for $j(r)$:\n$$I_p = \\int_S \\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta(r)} \\frac{V_{\\text{loop}}}{2\\pi R_0}\\right) \\, dS$$\nSince $V_{\\text{loop}}$ and $R_0$ are constants with respect to the integration over the area $S$, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$I_p = \\frac{V_{\\text{loop}}}{2\\pi R_0} \\int_S \\frac{1}{\\eta(r)} \\, dS$$\nIntroducing the electrical conductivity $\\sigma(r) = 1/\\eta(r)$, the expression becomes:\n$$I_p = \\frac{V_{\\text{loop}}}{2\\pi R_0} \\int_S \\sigma(r) \\, dS$$\nTo find the relationship for $V_{\\text{loop}}$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$V_{\\text{loop}} = 2\\pi R_0 \\frac{I_p}{\\int_S \\sigma(r) \\, dS}$$\nThis is the required expression relating $V_{\\text{loop}}$ to $I_p$, $R_0$, and the area integral of the conductivity profile.\n\nNow, we analyze the role of the effective charge, $Z_{\\text{eff}}$. We are given the classical Spitzer resistivity scaling:\n$$\\eta(r) \\propto Z_{\\text{eff}} T_e(r)^{-3/2}$$\nLet the constant of proportionality be $C$. Since $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ is assumed to be spatially uniform, we have:\n$$\\eta(r) = C Z_{\\text{eff}} T_e(r)^{-3/2}$$\nThe conductivity is the reciprocal of the resistivity:\n$$\\sigma(r) = \\frac{1}{\\eta(r)} = \\frac{1}{C Z_{\\text{eff}} T_e(r)^{-3/2}} = \\frac{T_e(r)^{3/2}}{C Z_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\sigma(r)$ into our formula for $V_{\\text{loop}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{loop}} = 2\\pi R_0 \\frac{I_p}{\\int_S \\frac{T_e(r)^{3/2}}{C Z_{\\text{eff}}} \\, dS}$$\nSince $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and $C$ are uniform, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$V_{\\text{loop}} = 2\\pi R_0 \\frac{I_p}{\\frac{1}{C Z_{\\text{eff}}} \\int_S T_e(r)^{3/2} \\, dS} = Z_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi R_0 C I_p}{\\int_S T_e(r)^{3/2} \\, dS} \\right)$$\nThis final form explicitly shows that for a fixed plasma current $I_p$ and a fixed electron temperature profile $T_e(r)$, the loop voltage is directly proportional to the effective charge: $V_{\\text{loop}} \\propto Z_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nAt a fixed loop voltage $V_{\\text{loop}}$, the current density profile is $j(r) = \\sigma(r) E_\\phi \\propto \\sigma(r) \\propto 1/Z_{\\text{eff}}$. An increase in $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ would cause the current density to decrease at every point in the plasma, thus reducing the total current $I_p$. Conversely, to maintain a fixed total current $I_p$ when $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ increases (and thus resistivity increases), the driving toroidal electric field $E_\\phi$, and therefore the loop voltage $V_{\\text{loop}}$, must be increased proportionally.\n\n2) Calculation of the change in loop voltage $\\Delta V_{\\text{loop}}$.\n\nFrom the derivation in part (1), we established the proportionality:\n$$V_{\\text{loop}} \\propto Z_{\\text{eff}}$$\nprovided that the total current $I_p$, major radius $R_0$, and the electron temperature profile $T_e(r)$ are all held constant. The problem states that a feedback system holds $I_p$ fixed at $I_p=0.80\\,\\text{MA}$ and that the temperature profile is unchanged.\n\nLet the initial state be denoted by the subscript $0$ and the final state by the subscript $1$. We can write the relationship as a ratio:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\text{loop},1}}{V_{\\text{loop},0}} = \\frac{Z_{\\text{eff},1}}{Z_{\\text{eff},0}}$$\nThe problem states that $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ undergoes a uniform step increase by a factor of $2$. This means:\n$$\\frac{Z_{\\text{eff},1}}{Z_{\\text{eff},0}} = 2$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the loop voltages must also be $2$:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\text{loop},1}}{V_{\\text{loop},0}} = 2 \\implies V_{\\text{loop},1} = 2 V_{\\text{loop},0}$$\nThe initial measured loop voltage is given as $V_{\\text{loop},0} = 3.20\\,\\text{V}$.\nThe final loop voltage required to maintain the constant current is:\n$$V_{\\text{loop},1} = 2 \\times 3.20\\,\\text{V} = 6.40\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe question asks for the change in the loop voltage, $\\Delta V_{\\text{loop}}$, which is defined as $\\Delta V_{\\text{loop}} = V_{\\text{loop},1} - V_{\\text{loop},0}$.\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{loop}} = 6.40\\,\\text{V} - 3.20\\,\\text{V} = 3.20\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe result is required to be rounded to three significant figures.

All provided parameters and definitions are standard and consistent. The problem is valid.\n\nThe analysis of the tearing mode instability is performed by dividing the plasma into two distinct spatial regions: an \"ideal outer region\" and a \"resistive inner layer\".\n\nIn the ideal outer region, which comprises the bulk of the plasma away from the rational surface at $x=0$, resistivity is negligible ($\\eta \\rightarrow 0$), and the plasma dynamics are governed by the equations of ideal MHD.

The scaling for the dimensionless growth rate $\\gamma \\tau_A$ (where $\\tau_A=a/v_A$) becomes:\n$$\n\\gamma \\tau_A \\propto (\\Delta' a)^{4/5} (ka)^{2/5} S^{-3/5}\n$$\nThis is the leading-order scaling relation.\n\nTo numerically estimate the growth rate, we use the complete formula which includes the numerical coefficient derived from the asymptotic matching:\n$$\n\\gamma \\tau_A = C (\\Delta' a)^{4/5} (ka)^{2/5} S^{-3/5}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is given by $C = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\Gamma(3/4)}\\right)^{4/5}$. Using the values $\\Gamma(1/4) \\approx 3.6256$ and $\\Gamma(3/4) \\approx 1.2254$, we find:\n$$\nC \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{3.6256}{2 \\times 1.2254}\\right)^{4/5} = \\left(\\frac{1.4793}{\\pi}\\right)^{4/5} \\approx (0.4708)^{4/5} \\approx 0.55\n$$\nSo the formula for our calculation is:\n$$\n\\gamma \\tau_A \\approx 0.55 (\\Delta' a)^{4/5} (ka)^{2/5} S^{-3/5}\n$$\nWe are given the parameters:\n- $\\Delta'a = 2$\n- $ka = 0.2$\n- $S = 10^7$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression:\n$$\n\\gamma \\tau_A \\approx 0.55 \\times (2)^{4/5} \\times (0.2)^{2/5} \\times (10^7)^{-3/5}\n$$\nWe evaluate each term:\n- $(2)^{4/5} = 2^{0.8} \\approx 1.74110$\n- $(0.2)^{2/5} = 0.2^{0.4} \\approx 0.52530$\n- $(10^7)^{-3/5} = 10^{-21/5} = 10^{-4.2} = 10^{0.8} \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 6.30957 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nNow, we multiply these values:\n$$\n\\gamma \\tau_A \\approx 0.55 \\times 1.74110 \\times 0.52530 \\times (6.30957 \\times 10^{-5})\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma \\tau_A \\approx 0.50303 \\times (6.30957 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 3.1739 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $3.17 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the modification of the scaling due to an impurity-driven increase in resistivity $\\eta$. The classical Spitzer resistivity for a plasma has the dependence $\\eta \\propto Z_{\\text{eff}} T_e^{-3/2}$, where $T_e$ is the electron temperature and $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective ion charge number. An increase in impurity concentration at a fixed electron temperature leads to an increase in $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and thus a proportional increase in $\\eta$, so $\\eta \\propto Z_{\\text{eff}}$.\nThe tearing mode growth rate scales as $\\gamma \\propto \\eta^{3/5}$. Therefore, the growth rate will scale with the effective charge as:\n$$\n\\gamma \\propto Z_{\\text{eff}}^{3/5}\n$$\nThis has significant implications for ohmically heated plasmas. While an increase in $\\eta$ would lead to a greater ohmic heating power deposition, $P_{\\Omega} = \\int \\eta J^2 dV$, its effect on MHD stability is strongly deleterious. The increased growth rate of tearing modes means that magnetic islands are more likely to form and grow. These islands degrade plasma confinement by flattening the pressure and temperature profiles across them. If they grow large enough, they can lead to a major disruption, a catastrophic event where confinement is lost entirely and the discharge terminates abruptly. Thus, impurity accumulation in a fusion plasma, by increasing resistivity, severely threatens its stability and performance, an effect that far outweighs any potential benefit from enhanced ohmic heating.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.17 \\times 10^{-5}}\n$$", "id": "3711990"}]}
