The FWHM half-width is given as $W$, which means at a time $t = t_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\pm W$, the areal density is half of its peak value: $\\rho R(t_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\pm W) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$.\nSubstituting this condition into the parabolic approximation:\n$$\\rho R(t_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\pm W) = \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa ((t_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\pm W) - t_{\\mathrm{pk}})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\n$$\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa W^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa W^{2}$$\nSolving for $\\kappa$ gives:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{W^{2}}$$\nThe maximum timing tolerance, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$, is defined by the condition that the fractional drop in areal density does not exceed $\\delta$. The limiting case is:\n$$\\rho R(t_{\\mathrm{pk}} + \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}) = (1 - \\delta) \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\nUsing the parabolic model for the left-hand side:\n$$\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2} = (1 - \\delta) \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\n$$\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2} = \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}} - \\delta \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\kappa (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2} = \\delta \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression we found for $\\kappa$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{W^{2}}\\right) (\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2} = \\delta \\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$$\nThe term $\\rho R_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ is non-zero and cancels from both sides, which is necessary as its value was not provided.\n$$\\frac{(\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}})^{2}}{2W^{2}} = \\delta$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ (and taking the positive root, as a time tolerance is a magnitude), we get the final expression:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}} = W \\sqrt{2 \\delta}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Dimensionless Ratio, $r$**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $r = \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}} / \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$r = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{P T_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\rho_{s} v_{e} u_{s}}\\right)}{\\left(W \\sqrt{2 \\delta}\\right)} = \\frac{P T_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\rho_{s} v_{e} u_{s} W \\sqrt{2 \\delta}}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n- $P = 3.0 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{pk}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\rho_{s} = 1.93 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$\n- $v_{e} = 3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $u_{s} = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $W = 80\\ \\mathrm{ps} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\delta = 0.10$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerator of $r$, which corresponds to $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}$ multiplied by the scale factors in the denominator of $r$. For clarity, we calculate $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}$ and $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$ separately.\n\nCalculation of $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}$:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{(1.93 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{5})} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{4}}{1.4475 \\times 10^{15}}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 4.145077 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nCalculation of $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}$:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}} = (8.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times \\sqrt{2 \\times 0.10} = (8.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times \\sqrt{0.20}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 3.577708 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{shift}}}{\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{tol}}} = \\frac{4.145077 \\times 10^{-11}}{3.577708 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 1.15858$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$r \\approx 1.16$$\nThis result, being greater than $1$, indicates that the timing misalignment caused by cone tip recession is larger than the maximum tolerable misalignment for this target design, suggesting it is a critical issue to be addressed for successful ignition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.16}$$", "id": "3699279"}]}
