It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and simplifying assumptions clearly stated, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. The language is objective and the scenario is physically plausible within the context of high-energy-density physics.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Ablation Pressure Relation**\n\nThe relationship between ablation pressure $P_a$, mass ablation rate per unit area $\\dot{m}$, and exhaust speed $V_e$ can be derived from the principle of conservation of momentum. We consider the ablated plasma as our system. In a steady-state process, a mass of material is continuously converted from a solid/dense state at rest to a hot plasma state moving away from the ablation front.\n\nLet's apply Newton's second law, which states that the net force on a system equals the rate of change of its momentum, $F = \\frac{dp}{dt}$.\n\nConsider a small time interval $dt$. During this time, a mass $dM$ of the ablator is heated, ionized, and ejected as plasma. We assume this mass starts from rest (velocity $v_{initial} = 0$) and is accelerated to a final exhaust speed $V_e$. The change in momentum of this mass element $dM$ is:\n$$dp = (dM) V_e - (dM) (0) = V_e dM$$\n\nThe rate of change of momentum of the exhaust gas is therefore:\n$$\\frac{dp}{dt} = V_e \\frac{dM}{dt}$$\n\nThe term $\\frac{dM}{dt}$ is the total mass ablation rate, which we denote as $\\dot{M}$.\n$$\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\dot{M} V_e$$\n\nAccording to Newton's second law, this rate of change of momentum must be equal to the net force exerted on the ablating mass to accelerate it. Let this force be $F_{accel}$.\n$$F_{accel} = \\dot{M} V_e$$\n\nBy Newton's third law, the ablated plasma exerts an equal and opposite force back on the unablated, dense material. This reaction force is the thrust that drives the target.\n$$F_{thrust} = F_{accel} = \\dot{M} V_e$$\n\nThe problem defines the ablation pressure, $P_a$, as the pressure (force per unit area) acting on the solid surface. This is precisely the thrust force per unit area, $A$.\n$$P_a = \\frac{F_{thrust}}{A} = \\frac{\\dot{M} V_e}{A}$$\n\nThe problem also defines the mass ablation rate per unit area, $\\dot{m}$, which is related to the total mass ablation rate $\\dot{M}$ by $\\dot{m} = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{A}$. Substituting this into our expression for $P_a$:\n$$P_a = \\left(\\frac{\\dot{M}}{A}\\right) V_e = \\dot{m} V_e$$\n\nThis is the fundamental relation connecting ablation pressure, mass ablation rate per unit area, and exhaust velocity. It is analogous to the rocket equation's thrust expression.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Mass Ablation Rate per Unit Area ($\\dot{m}$)**\n\nUsing the derived relation, we can solve for $\\dot{m}$:\n$$\\dot{m} = \\frac{P_a}{V_e}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nAblation pressure, $P_a = 2.0 \\times 10^{13} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\nExhaust speed, $V_e = 3.0 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$\\dot{m} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{13} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}}{3.0 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}$$\n\nRecalling that $1 \\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}$, the units are:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}}{\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} = \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThis is the correct unit for mass ablation rate per unit area.\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\\dot{m} = \\frac{2.0}{3.0} \\times 10^{13-5} \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 0.666... \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\dot{m} = 6.67 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Mass-Loss Time ($t_{\\mathrm{loss}}$)**\n\nThe initial areal density of the ablator is given as $\\Sigma = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}$. This represents the total mass per unit area that needs to be ablated. The mass ablation rate per unit area, $\\dot{m}$, is assumed to be constant.
