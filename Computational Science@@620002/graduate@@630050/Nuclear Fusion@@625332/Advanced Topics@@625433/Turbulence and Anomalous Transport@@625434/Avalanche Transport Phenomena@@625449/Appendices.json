Finally, we will evaluate $F$ for the given numerical values.\n\nWe begin by constructing the functional form of the ion heat flux, $Q_i$, in terms of the normalized gradient, $G$. The problem provides a set of proportionalities. Let us introduce proportionality constants $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ to write them as equations.\n\nThe turbulent ion heat flux is given as:\n$$Q_{i} \\sim n_{i} T_{i} \\chi_{i} \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln T_{i}}{\\partial r}\\right|$$\nFrom the problem statement, we have the relation $L_{T}^{-1} = G/R$, where $L_{T}^{-1} \\equiv |\\partial \\ln T_{i}/\\partial r|$.

Radial Heat Flux Profile, $q(r)$**\nThe steady-state energy conservation equation is $\\frac{d}{dr}(r\\,q(r)) = r S(r)$. Integrating from the magnetic axis ($r=0$) to an arbitrary radius $r$ yields:\n$$r\\,q(r) - 0 \\cdot q(0) = \\int_0^r r' S(r') dr'$$\nAssuming the flux $q(0)$ is finite, the boundary term at $r=0$ vanishes. The flux is thus $q(r) = \\frac{1}{r} \\int_0^r r' S(r') dr'$.\nWe evaluate this integral for the two regions defined by the heating profile:\n-   For $0 \\le r \\le r_0$: $S(r')=S_0$.\n    $$q(r) = \\frac{1}{r} \\int_0^r r' S_0 dr' = \\frac{S_0}{r} \\left[\\frac{r'^2}{2}\\right]_0^r = \\frac{S_0 r}{2}$$\n-   For $r_0  r \\le a$: $S(r')$ is non-zero only up to $r_0$.\n    $$q(r) = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\int_0^{r_0} r' S_0 dr' + \\int_{r_0}^r r' \\cdot 0 \\cdot dr' \\right) = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( S_0 \\frac{r_0^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2r}$$\nThe resulting heat flux profile is continuous at $r=r_0$ and is given by:\n$$q(r) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{S_0 r}{2}  \\text{for } 0 \\le r \\le r_0 \\\\ \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2r}  \\text{for } r_0  r \\le a \\end{cases}$$\n\n**2. Temperature Gradient Profile, $\\frac{dT}{dr}$**\nThe temperature gradient is determined by the transport law. The local gradient magnitude $|\\frac{dT}{dr}|$ is set by the smaller of the critical threshold $\\kappa_c$ and the magnitude required by the low-transport law, which is $\\frac{q(r)}{K_L}$. Since temperature decreases outward, $\\frac{dT}{dr} \\le 0$.\n$$\\frac{dT}{dr} = - \\min\\left(\\frac{q(r)}{K_L}, \\kappa_c\\right)$$\nWe must identify the regions where the system is in the low-transport (sub-critical) or avalanche (critical) state by comparing $\\frac{q(r)}{K_L}$ to $\\kappa_c$.\n-   For $0 \\le r \\le r_0$: The condition for being at or above critical is $\\frac{q(r)}{K_L} \\ge \\kappa_c$, which translates to $\\frac{S_0 r}{2K_L} \\ge \\kappa_c$, or $r \\ge \\frac{2K_L\\kappa_c}{S_0}$. Let us define the critical radius $r_c = \\frac{2K_L\\kappa_c}{S_0}$. The problem states $0  r_c  r_0$, so the gradient is clamped at $-\\kappa_c$ for $r \\in [r_c, r_0]$. For $r \\in [0, r_c)$, the gradient is $-\\frac{S_0 r}{2K_L}$.\n-   For $r_0  r \\le a$: The condition for being at or above critical is $\\frac{q(r)}{K_L} \\ge \\kappa_c$, which translates to $\\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L r} \\ge \\kappa_c$, or $r \\le \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L\\kappa_c}$. Let us define this second critical radius $r_s = \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L\\kappa_c}$. Note that $r_s = \\frac{r_0^2}{r_c}$. Since $r_0  r_c$, it follows that $r_s  r_0$. The gradient is clamped at $-\\kappa_c$ for $r \\in (r_0, r_s]$. For $r  r_s$, the gradient is $-\\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L r}$.\n\nCombining these findings, the full avalanche-dominated (clamped) region is $[r_c, r_s]$. However, the plasma only extends to $r=a$. Thus, the effective clamped region is $[r_c, r_s^*]$, where $r_s^* = \\min(r_s, a)$. The full radial profile of the temperature gradient is:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dr}(r) = \\begin{cases} -\\frac{S_0 r}{2K_L}  \\text{for } 0 \\le r  r_c \\\\ -\\kappa_c  \\text{for } r_c \\le r \\le r_s^* \\\\ -\\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L r}  \\text{for } r_s^*  r \\le a \\end{cases}$$\nThe third region exists only if $r_s^*  a$, which is equivalent to $r_s  a$.\n\n**3. Temperature Profile, $T(r)$**\nWe find the temperature profile by integrating $\\frac{dT}{dr}$ inward from the edge boundary condition $T(a)=T_a$.\n$$T(r) = T(a) - \\int_r^a \\frac{dT}{dr'} dr' = T_a + \\int_r^a \\left(-\\frac{dT}{dr'}\\right) dr'$$\nWe evaluate this integral piecewise for the different regions of $r$.\n\n-   **Case 1: $r_s^*  r \\le a$** (This is the outermost, sub-critical region, existing only if $r_s  a$)\n    In this region, the integral is simple:\n    $$T(r) = T_a + \\int_r^a \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L r'} dr' = T_a + \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r}\\right)$$\n\n-   **Case 2: $r_c  r \\le r_s^*$** (This is the critical/clamped region)\n    The integral must be split at $r_s^*$:\n    $$T(r) = T_a + \\int_r^{r_s^*} \\kappa_c dr' + \\int_{r_s^*}^a \\left(-\\frac{dT}{dr'}\\right) dr'$$\n    The second integral corresponds to the temperature rise from $a$ to $r_s^*$, which is $T(r_s^*) - T_a$. From Case 1 (or by direct integration if $r_s^*=a$), $T(r_s^*) = T_a + \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r_s^*}\\right)$ (note this term is zero if $r_s^*=a$).\n    So, $T(r) = T(r_s^*) + \\kappa_c (r_s^*-r) = T_a + \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r_s^*}\\right) + \\kappa_c(r_s^* - r)$.\n\n-   **Case 3: $0 \\le r \\le r_c$** (This is the innermost, sub-critical region)\n    The integral is split at $r_c$ and $r_s^*$:\n    $$T(r) = T_a + \\int_r^{r_c} \\frac{S_0 r'}{2K_L} dr' + \\int_{r_c}^{r_s^*} \\kappa_c dr' + \\int_{r_s^*}^a \\left(-\\frac{dT}{dr'}\\right) dr'$$\n    The last two terms constitute the temperature rise from $a$ to $r_c$, which is $T(r_c) - T_a$. From Case 2, this is $T(r_c) = T_a + \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r_s^*}\\right) + \\kappa_c(r_s^* - r_c)$.\n    The first integral is $\\frac{S_0}{2K_L} \\int_r^{r_c} r' dr' = \\frac{S_0}{4K_L}(r_c^2 - r^2)$.\n    Combining these gives:\n    $$T(r) = T_a + \\frac{S_0 r_0^2}{2K_L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r_s^*}\\right) + \\kappa_c(r_s^* - r_c) + \\frac{S_0}{4K_L}(r_c^2 - r^2)$$\n\nThese three expressions form a single, continuous function for $T(r)$ across the domain $[0, a]$.
