A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem is solved in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Photon Shot-Noise Scaling**\n\nThe arrival of photons at the detector is described as a Poisson process. Let $N$ be the mean rate of photon arrivals, with units of photons per second ($\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). A measurement is made over a fixed integration time $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe expected number of photons, or the mean count, $\\mu_C$, detected during the interval $\\Delta t$ is given by the product of the mean rate and the time interval:\n$$\n\\mu_C = N \\Delta t\n$$\nA fundamental property of a Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean. If $C$ is the random variable representing the number of photons counted in the interval $\\Delta t$, then the variance of $C$, denoted $\\sigma_C^2$, is:\n$$\n\\sigma_C^2 = \\mu_C = N \\Delta t\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the photon counts, $\\sigma_C$, is the square root of the variance. This standard deviation represents the intrinsic statistical fluctuation in the count number, which is the photon shot noise.\n$$\n\\sigma_C = \\sqrt{\\sigma_C^2} = \\sqrt{N \\Delta t}\n$$\nThis result shows that the photon shot-noise standard deviation, $\\sigma_C$, scales with the square root of the mean detected photon rate $N$ and the square root of the integration time $\\Delta t$.\n\n**Part 2: Required Mean Photon Rate $N$**\n\nThe signal measured by the diagnostic is the number of photons $C$ collected in the time $\\Delta t$. The mean signal level is therefore proportional to the mean count, $\\mu_C$. The noise in this measurement is the shot noise, quantified by the standard deviation $\\sigma_C$.\n\nThe fractional uncertainty of the intensity measurement due to shot noise is the ratio of the noise (standard deviation) to the mean signal (mean count).\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Uncertainty} = \\frac{\\sigma_C}{\\mu_C}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma_C$ and $\\mu_C$ derived above:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_C}{\\mu_C} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N \\Delta t}}{N \\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N \\Delta t}}\n$$\nThis fractional uncertainty sets the limit on the smallest fractional fluctuation that can be resolved. The problem requires that this shot-noise-limited uncertainty must not exceed the target physical fluctuation level, which is given as $\\delta n_{e} / n_{e} = 0.01$. Let's denote this target level as $\\epsilon$.\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e} = 0.01\n$$\nThe condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N \\Delta t}} \\le \\epsilon\n$$\nTo find the minimum required photon rate $N$ that satisfies this condition, we use the equality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N \\Delta t}} = \\epsilon\n$$\nSolving for $N$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{N \\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\nN \\Delta t = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 \\Delta t}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the time resolution $\\Delta t$ is chosen to satisfy the Nyquist criterion for a measurement bandwidth $B$. The Nyquist sampling theorem states that to faithfully represent a signal with a bandwidth $B$, the sampling frequency must be at least $2B$. This corresponds to a maximum sampling time interval (or integration time) of $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{2B}$.\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta t$ into the equation for $N$:\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2B}\\right)} = \\frac{2B}{\\epsilon^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value for the target fluctuation level, $\\epsilon = 0.01$:\n$$\nN = \\frac{2B}{(0.01)^2} = \\frac{2B}{(10^{-2})^2} = \\frac{2B}{10^{-4}}\n$$\n$$\nN = (2 \\times 10^4) B = 20000 B\n$$\nThis is the required mean photon rate $N$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) as a function of the measurement bandwidth $B$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20000 B}\n$$", "id": "3691839"}, {"introduction": "Once we are confident in our signal-to-noise ratio, we must consider instrumental effects that can mimic or obscure the plasma physics we aim to study.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, a symbolic derivation of the apparent number of pixels, $N_{\\mathrm{px}}$, and second, a numerical evaluation using the provided parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Symbolic Derivation**\n\nThe apparent advection arises because the excited deuterium atom travels a finite distance during its radiative lifetime before emitting a photon. We must calculate this distance and project it onto the axis of the BES detector's pixel column.\n\n1.  **Speed of the Deuterium Atoms**: The deuterium atoms in the neutral beam have a kinetic energy $E_b$. Using the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy, we relate this energy to the beam speed, $v_b$.\n    $$E_b = \\frac{1}{2} m_D v_b^2$$\n    Solving for the speed $v_b$ gives:\n    $$v_b = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 E_b}{m_D}}$$\n\n2.  **Distance Traveled During Lifetime**: An excited deuterium atom travels at this speed $v_b$ for a duration equal to the effective radiative lifetime, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Assuming uniform linear motion, the distance $d$ traveled along the beam's direction is:\n    $$d = v_b \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $v_b$:\n    $$d = \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 E_b}{m_D}}$$\n\n3.  **Projected Displacement**: The BES measurement observes this displacement in its own coordinate system. The pixel column direction is at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the beam's direction of motion. The apparent displacement, $d_{\\mathrm{app}}$, is the projection of the travel distance $d$ onto the pixel column axis. From basic geometry, this projection is:\n    $$d_{\\mathrm{app}} = d \\cos(\\theta)$$\n    Substituting the expression for $d$:\n    $$d_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cos(\\theta) \\sqrt{\\frac{2 E_b}{m_D}}$$\n\n4.  **Displacement in Pixels**: The problem provides the spatial calibration of the detector in terms of length per pixel, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{px}}$. To find the number of pixels, $N_{\\mathrm{px}}$, that correspond to the apparent displacement $d_{\\mathrm{app}}$, we divide $d_{\\mathrm{app}}$ by $\\ell_{\\mathrm{px}}$.\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{px}} = \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\ell_{\\mathrm{px}}}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $d_{\\mathrm{app}}$ yields the final symbolic formula for the apparent pixel shift:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{px}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cos(\\theta)}{\\ell_{\\mathrm{px}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 E_b}{m_D}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula.
