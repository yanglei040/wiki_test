It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe dimensionless parameter $\\alpha$ quantifies the drive for pressure-driven ballooning instabilities. In the standard $s-\\alpha$ model for a large aspect-ratio tokamak with circular flux surfaces, it is defined as:\n$$\n\\alpha = - \\frac{2 \\mu_{0} R q^{2}}{B^{2}} \\frac{dp}{dr}\n$$\nThis parameter relates the plasma pressure gradient, $\\frac{dp}{dr}$, which drives the instability, to the confining magnetic pressure, which is proportional to $\\frac{B^{2}}{2 \\mu_{0}}$, and geometric factors $R$ and $q$. A negative pressure gradient ($\\frac{dp}{dr} < 0$), which corresponds to pressure decreasing outwards from the magnetic axis, results in a positive value of $\\alpha$, indicating an instability drive.\n\nThe provided values are all in standard SI units, so they can be substituted directly into the formula.\nGiven:\n- $dp/dr = -2.0 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n- $R = 1.7 \\ \\text{m}$\n- $B = 3.0 \\ \\text{T}$\n- $q = 3.0$\n- $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\text{N}\\,\\text{A}^{-2}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = - \\frac{2 (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (1.7) (3.0)^{2}}{(3.0)^{2}} (-2.0 \\times 10^{5})\n$$\nThe units are consistent for a dimensionless result. For clarity:\n$\\text{Pa} = \\text{N}/\\text{m}^{2}$ and $\\text{T} = \\text{N}/(\\text{A} \\cdot \\text{m})$.\n$$\n[\\alpha] = \\frac{[\\text{N}\\,\\text{A}^{-2}] \\cdot [\\text{m}]}{[\\text{T}^{2}]} \\cdot [\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}] = \\frac{(\\text{N}/\\text{A}^{2}) \\cdot \\text{m}}{(\\text{N}^{2}/(\\text{A}^{2}\\text{m}^{2}))} \\cdot (\\text{N}/\\text{m}^{3}) = \\frac{\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}}{\\text{A}^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{A}^{2}\\text{m}^{2}}{\\text{N}^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}^{3}} = \\frac{\\text{N}^{2}\\text{A}^{2}\\text{m}^{3}}{\\text{N}^{2}\\text{A}^{2}\\text{m}^{3}} = 1\n$$\nThe terms $(3.0)^{2}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n$$\n\\alpha = - 2 (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (1.7) (-2.0 \\times 10^{5})\n$$\nThe two negative signs cancel, resulting in a positive $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = 2 \\cdot (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\cdot (1.7) \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{5})\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = (2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1.7 \\cdot 2.0) \\cdot \\pi \\cdot (10^{-7} \\cdot 10^{5})\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = 27.2 \\cdot \\pi \\cdot 10^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = 0.272 \\pi\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 0.272 \\times 3.14159265...\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 0.8544732...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 0.8545\n$$\n\n### Stability Assessment\nThe second part of the problem requires an assessment of this value with respect to typical ideal ballooning stability boundaries. Ideal MHD ballooning stability is often analyzed in the $s-\\alpha$ plane, where $s = (r/q)(dq/dr)$ is the magnetic shear parameter. The problem specifies \"moderate magnetic shear,\" which typically corresponds to values of $s$ in the range of approximately $0.5$ to $2.0$.\n\nFor positive shear ($s > 0$), there is a critical value of $\\alpha$, denoted $\\alpha_{c}(s)$, above which the plasma is unstable to ideal ballooning modes. For small $s$, $\\alpha_{c}$ is roughly proportional to $s$. For moderate-to-high shear ($s \\gtrsim 1$), $\\alpha_{c}$ tends to saturate or increase more slowly, with typical values being on the order of unity. For example, a common rule of thumb for the first stability boundary is that $\\alpha_{c}$ is of order $s$, so for $s=1$, $\\alpha_c \\approx 1$. Detailed calculations show that for a wide range of equilibria with moderate shear, the ideal ballooning boundary lies at $\\alpha_{c} \\approx 0.6 - 1.2$.\n\nOur computed value is $\\alpha \\approx 0.8545$. This value is squarely within the typical range for the ideal MHD ballooning limit in a tokamak with moderate shear. Therefore, it can be concluded that the plasma at this location in the pedestal has a pressure gradient that is high enough to be near, or potentially exceeding, the ideal ballooning stability threshold.

Solution Derivation\n\nThe stability of a tokamak plasma against ideal infinite-$n$ ballooning modes is determined by the balance between the destabilizing pressure gradient in the region of unfavorable magnetic curvature and the stabilizing effect of magnetic field line bending. In the large-aspect-ratio, circular flux surface limit, this competition is elegantly captured by the $s$-$\\alpha$ diagram.\n\n-   The normalized pressure gradient, $\\alpha \\equiv - (2\\mu_0 R q^2 / B^2)(dp/dr)$, represents the drive for the instability. A larger pressure gradient (more negative $dp/dr$) results in a larger $\\alpha$.\n-   The magnetic shear, $s \\equiv (r/q)(dq/dr)$, represents the primary stabilizing effect, as it causes neighboring field lines to have different pitches, thus resisting the ballooning deformation.\n\nA plasma is stable if its operating point $(s, \\alpha)$ lies within the stable region of the $s$-$\\alpha$ diagram. For a given shear $s$, there is a critical pressure gradient $\\alpha_{crit}(s)$ above which the plasma is unstable. The condition for instability is $\\alpha > \\alpha_{crit}(s)$.\n\nThe problem asks to determine the approximate placement of the stability curve from first principles. The governing high-$n$ ballooning mode equation is a second-order ODE for the mode displacement along the magnetic field line. Solving for its marginal stability point ($\\omega^2=0$) yields the boundary curve $\\alpha_{crit}(s)$. For a standard circular tokamak with positive shear ($s > 0$), the stability boundary starts at the origin $(s=0, \\alpha=0)$. For moderate values of shear ($s \\gtrsim 0.5$), the boundary is well-approximated by a linear relationship, $\\alpha_{crit} \\approx c \\cdot s$, where the constant $c$ is typically found to be in the range of $0.6$ to $1.0$. A common and reasonable approximation is $\\alpha_{crit} \\approx 0.8s$. For very low shear ($s \\ll 1$), the boundary has a different character, approximately $\\alpha_{crit} \\propto \\sqrt{s}$. We will find that the stability classification of the given points is robust against the precise choice of approximation. We will proceed by calculating the $(s, \\alpha)$ coordinates for each point and comparing them to a representative boundary.\n\nFirst, we calculate the common coefficient for $\\alpha$:\n$$ -\\dfrac{2\\mu_{0} R}{B^{2}} = -\\dfrac{2 \\cdot (4\\pi\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}) \\cdot (3.0\\,\\mathrm{m})}{(3.0\\,\\mathrm{T})^{2}} = -\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\times 10^{-7} $$\n\nNow, we calculate $s$ and $\\alpha$ for each point.\n\n**Point X:**\n-   $s_X = \\dfrac{r}{q}\\dfrac{dq}{dr} = \\dfrac{0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}}{4.0} \\cdot (0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) = 0.0625$\n-   $\\alpha_X = \\left(-\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\times 10^{-7}\\right) \\cdot q^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{dp}{dr} = \\left(-\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\times 10^{-7}\\right) \\cdot (4.0)^2 \\cdot (-2.0\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa/m})$\n-   $\\alpha_X = \\left(\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\right) \\cdot 16 \\cdot (2.0\\times 10^{-2}) = \\dfrac{256\\pi}{3} \\times 10^{-2}$\n-   $\\alpha_X \\approx \\dfrac{256 \\times 3.14159}{3} \\times 10^{-2} \\approx 2.6808$\n-   Coordinates for X: $(s_X, \\alpha_X) \\approx (0.0625, 2.68)$\n\n**Point Y:**\n-   $s_Y = \\dfrac{r}{q}\\dfrac{dq}{dr} = \\dfrac{0.45\\,\\mathrm{m}}{3.6} \\cdot (1.20\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) = 0.125 \\cdot 1.20 = 0.15$\n-   $\\alpha_Y = \\left(-\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\times 10^{-7}\\right) \\cdot q^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{dp}{dr} = \\left(-\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\times 10^{-7}\\right) \\cdot (3.6)^2 \\cdot (-1.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa/m})$\n-   $\\alpha_Y = \\left(\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\right) \\cdot 12.96 \\cdot (1.0\\times 10^{-3}) = 34.56\\pi \\times 10^{-3}$\n-   $\\alpha_Y \\approx 34.56 \\times 3.14159 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.1086$\n-   Coordinates for Y: $(s_Y, \\alpha_Y) \\approx (0.15, 0.109)$\n\n**Point Z:**\n-   $s_Z = \\dfrac{r}{q}\\dfrac{dq}{dr} = \\dfrac{0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}}{3.2} \\cdot (2.00\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) = 0.125 \\cdot 2.00 = 0.25$\n-   $\\alpha_Z = \\left(-\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\times 10^{-7}\\right) \\cdot q^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{dp}{dr} = \\left(-\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\times 10^{-7}\\right) \\cdot (3.2)^2 \\cdot (-1.0\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa/m})$\n-   $\\alpha_Z = \\left(\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3}\\right) \\cdot 10.24 \\cdot (1.0\\times 10^{-2}) = \\dfrac{81.92\\pi}{3} \\times 10^{-2}$\n-   $\\alpha_Z \\approx \\dfrac{81.92 \\times 3.14159}{3} \\times 10^{-2} \\approx 0.8579$\n-   Coordinates for Z: $(s_Z, \\alpha_Z) \\approx (0.25, 0.858)$\n\nNow we classify each point relative to the stability boundary.

The critical alpha is $\\alpha_{crit}(s_Y) \\approx 0.8 \\times 0.15 = 0.12$.

The critical alpha is $\\alpha_{crit}(s_Z) \\approx 0.8 \\times 0.25 = 0.20$. Since $\\alpha_Z = 0.858 \\gg \\alpha_{crit} = 0.20$, point Z is in the unstable region. **Z is unstable.**\n\nThe classification is: X is unstable, Y is stable, and Z is unstable.

Substituting these relations back into the expression for $d \\ln p / dr$:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\ln p}{dr} = \\frac{p_e}{p} \\left( \\frac{d \\ln n_e}{dr} + \\frac{d \\ln T_e}{dr} \\right) + \\frac{p_i}{p} \\left( \\frac{d \\ln n_e}{dr} + \\frac{d \\ln T_i}{dr} \\right)\n$$\nGrouping terms with the same logarithmic gradient gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\ln p}{dr} = \\left(\\frac{p_e}{p} + \\frac{p_i}{p}\\right) \\frac{d \\ln n_e}{dr} + \\frac{p_e}{p} \\frac{d \\ln T_e}{dr} + \\frac{p_i}{p} \\frac{d \\ln T_i}{dr}\n$$\nSince $p = p_e + p_i$, the first term simplifies, and we arrive at the general formula:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\ln p}{dr} = \\frac{d \\ln n_e}{dr} + \\frac{p_e}{p} \\frac{d \\ln T_e}{dr} + \\frac{p_i}{p} \\frac{d \\ln T_i}{dr}\n$$\nThe pressure fractions $p_e/p$ and $p_i/p$ depend on the temperatures. Let $T_e$ and $T_i$ denote the temperatures as given in keV. Since the fractions are ratios of pressures, the conversion factors (from keV to eV, and from eV to Joules) cancel out:\n$$\n\\frac{p_e}{p} = \\frac{n_e e (T_e \\times 10^3)}{n_e e (T_e \\times 10^3 + T_i \\times 10^3)} = \\frac{T_e}{T_e + T_i}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{p_i}{p} = \\frac{n_i e (T_i \\times 10^3)}{n_e e (T_e \\times 10^3 + T_i \\times 10^3)} = \\frac{T_i}{T_e + T_i}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the formula for the logarithmic pressure gradient.\nGiven:\n$T_e = 1.3 \\ \\text{keV}$\n$T_i = 1.8 \\ \\text{keV}$\n$d \\ln n_e / dr = -65 \\ \\text{m}^{-1}$\n$d \\ln T_e / dr = -35 \\ \\text{m}^{-1}$\n$d \\ln T_i / dr = -30 \\ \\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nThe sum of temperatures is $T_e + T_i = 1.3 + 1.8 = 3.1 \\ \\text{keV}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\ln p}{dr} = (-65) + \\frac{1.3}{3.1}(-35) + \\frac{1.8}{3.1}(-30) \\ \\left[\\text{m}^{-1}\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d \\ln p}{dr} = -65 - \\frac{1.3 \\times 35}{3.1} - \\frac{1.8 \\times 30}{3.1} = -65 - \\frac{45.5}{3.1} - \\frac{54}{3.1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d \\ln p}{dr} = -65 - \\frac{45.5 + 54}{3.1} = -65 - \\frac{99.5}{3.1}\n$$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\ln p}{dr} = \\frac{-65 \\times 3.1 - 99.5}{3.1} = \\frac{-201.5 - 99.5}{3.1} = -\\frac{301}{3.1} \\ \\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow we compute the pressure gradient scale length $L_p$:\n$$\nL_p = - \\left( -\\frac{301}{3.1} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{3.1}{301} \\ \\text{m}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless ratio $R/L_p$.
