The task is to determine which resonant surfaces lie within a specified region of the plasma edge, known as the pedestal.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nFirst, I must meticulously validate the problem statement.\n\n#### 1.1.

Validation against Criteria\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the established physics of magnetic confinement fusion. The definitions of safety factor $q$, magnetic shear $s$, and the resonance condition $q=m/n$ are fundamental concepts in tokamak physics.

It does not render the problem scientifically implausible.\n\n#### 1.3. Verdict\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined and scientifically sound exercise in applying fundamental principles of tokamak physics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Safety Factor Profile\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic shear $s$ is approximately constant across the pedestal, with a value $s_{\\mathrm{e}}$. The definition of shear is given as:\n$$s = \\frac{r}{q} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}r}$$\nSetting $s = s_{\\mathrm{e}}$, we obtain a first-order ordinary differential equation for the safety factor $q(r)$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{e}} = \\frac{r}{q} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}r}$$\nThis equation is separable. We can rearrange it to isolate the variables $q$ and $r$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{q} = s_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r}{r}$$\nTo find the function $q(r)$, we integrate this expression. We can perform a definite integration from the boundary at the plasma edge, $r=a$, to an arbitrary radius $r$ within the pedestal.\n$$\\int_{q(a)}^{q(r)} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q'}{q'} = \\int_{a}^{r} s_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r'}{r'}$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\\left[ \\ln |q'| \\right]_{q(a)}^{q(r)} = s_{\\mathrm{e}} \\left[ \\ln |r'| \\right]_{a}^{r}$$\nSince $q$ and $r$ are positive definite in this context, the absolute values can be dropped.\n$$\\ln(q(r)) - \\ln(q(a)) = s_{\\mathrm{e}} (\\ln(r) - \\ln(a))$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{q(r)}{q(a)}\\right) = s_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\right)$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the relationship for $q(r)$:\n$$\\frac{q(r)}{q(a)} = \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$\nSubstituting the given boundary condition $q(a) = q_{\\mathrm{a}}$, we arrive at the explicit safety factor profile across the pedestal:\n$$q(r) = q_{\\mathrm{a}} \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$\n\n### Step 3: Determination of the Range of q-values in the Pedestal\n\nThe pedestal is defined over the radial interval $r \\in [r_{\\mathrm{in}}, a]$, where $r_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.9\\,a$. We need to find the range of values that $q(r)$ takes within this interval. Since the shear $s_{\\mathrm{e}} = 1.5$ is positive, the derivative $\\mathrm{d}q/\\mathrm{d}r = s_{\\mathrm{e}} q/r$ is also positive, which means $q(r)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $r$. Therefore, the minimum value of $q$ occurs at the inner boundary $r = r_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and the maximum value occurs at the outer boundary $r=a$.\n\nThe value of $q$ at the outer boundary is given:\n$$q(a) = q_{\\mathrm{a}} = 4.1$$\nThe value of $q$ at the inner boundary is found by substituting $r = r_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.9\\,a$ into our derived profile:\n$$q(r_{\\mathrm{in}}) = q(0.9\\,a) = q_{\\mathrm{a}} \\left(\\frac{0.9\\,a}{a}\\right)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}} = q_{\\mathrm{a}} (0.9)^{s_{\\mathrm{e}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values $q_{\\mathrm{a}} = 4.1$ and $s_{\\mathrm{e}} = 1.5$:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{min}} = q(0.9\\,a) = 4.1 \\times (0.9)^{1.5}$$\nThus, the range of safety factor values in the pedestal is:\n$$q \\in \\left[ 4.1 \\times (0.9)^{1.5}, 4.1 \\right]$$\n\n### Step 4: Identification of Resonant Integer Mode Numbers\n\nA rational surface corresponding to the applied RMP with toroidal mode number $n=3$ exists at a radius $r$ if the safety factor $q(r)$ at that radius satisfies the resonance condition $q(r) = m/n = m/3$ for some integer $m$. For such a surface to lie within the pedestal, its corresponding $q$-value must fall within the range calculated in the previous step.\nThe condition is:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{min}} \\le \\frac{m}{3} \\le q_{\\mathrm{max}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $q_{\\mathrm{min}}$ and $q_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$4.1 \\times (0.9)^{1.5} \\le \\frac{m}{3} \\le 4.1$$\nTo find the possible integer values of $m$, we multiply the entire inequality by $3$:\n$$3 \\times 4.1 \\times (0.9)^{1.5} \\le m \\le 3 \\times 4.1$$\n$$12.3 \\times (0.9)^{1.5} \\le m \\le 12.3$$\nNow, we must evaluate the lower bound.\nThe term $(0.9)^{1.5}$ can be written as $(0.9)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\sqrt{(0.9)^3} = \\sqrt{0.729}$.\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{0.729} \\approx 0.853815$.\nSo, the lower bound for $m$ is approximately:\n$$12.3 \\times 0.853815 \\approx 10.5019$$\nThe inequality for the integer $m$ is therefore:\n$$10.5019 \\ldots \\le m \\le 12.3$$\nThe integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $11$ and $12$.\nFor $m=11$, the required safety factor is $q=11/3 \\approx 3.667$. This value is within the pedestal range, as $4.1 \\times (0.9)^{1.5} \\approx 3.5006 < 3.667 < 4.1$.\nFor $m=12$, the required safety factor is $q=12/3 = 4$. This value is also within the pedestal range, as $3.5006 < 4 < 4.1$.\nAny other integer $m$ would correspond to a $q$-value outside the pedestal. For example, $m=10$ gives $q=10/3 \\approx 3.333$, which is below the minimum $q$ in the pedestal. $m=13$ gives $q=13/3 \\approx 4.333$, which is above the maximum $q$.\n\nThe complete set of integer values for $m$ for which a rational surface $q(r)=m/3$ lies within the specified pedestal region is $\\{11, 12\\}$. The question asks for this to be expressed as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 11 & 12 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3697957"}, {"introduction": "The effectiveness of an RMP is not determined by its structure in the laboratory frame alone, but by how it is perceived by the moving plasma.

The material derivative relates the time evolution in the stationary (lab) frame to the time evolution in the co-moving (plasma) frame. It is defined as:\n$$ \\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\vec{v} \\cdot \\nabla $$\nHere, $\\vec{v}$ is the plasma fluid velocity.

In this coordinate system, the dot product $\\vec{v} \\cdot \\nabla$ simplifies to $\\omega_{\\phi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + \\omega_{\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$.\n\nWe apply the material derivative to the phase $\\xi$:\n$$ \\frac{D\\xi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(n\\,\\phi + m\\,\\theta - \\omega\\,t) + \\left(\\omega_{\\phi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + \\omega_{\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)(n\\,\\phi + m\\,\\theta - \\omega\\,t) $$\nCalculating the two terms separately:\nThe partial time derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\xi}{\\partial t} = -\\omega $$\nThe convective part of the derivative is:\n$$ \\left(\\omega_{\\phi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + \\omega_{\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)(n\\,\\phi + m\\,\\theta - \\omega\\,t) = n\\,\\omega_{\\phi} + m\\,\\omega_{\\theta} $$\nCombining these terms gives the total rate of change of phase as seen by a moving plasma element:\n$$ \\frac{D\\xi}{Dt} = n\\,\\omega_{\\phi} + m\\,\\omega_{\\theta} - \\omega $$\nThe effective angular frequency in the plasma frame, let us call it $\\omega_{eff}$, is defined such that the phase in this frame can be written as $\\xi' = n\\phi' + m\\theta' - \\omega_{eff}t$, where $\\phi'$ and $\\theta'$ are the coordinates in the plasma frame. The rate of change of phase at a fixed point in the plasma frame is $\\partial\\xi'/\\partial t = -\\omega_{eff}$. By definition, the material derivative $D/Dt$ gives the rate of change experienced by a fluid element, which is stationary in its own frame. Therefore, $D\\xi/Dt$ is equivalent to the rate of change of phase at a fixed point in the plasma frame.\n$$ \\frac{D\\xi}{Dt} = -\\omega_{eff} $$\nBy equating the two expressions, we find the effective frequency:\n$$ -\\omega_{eff} = n\\,\\omega_{\\phi} + m\\,\\omega_{\\theta} - \\omega $$\n$$ \\omega_{eff} = \\omega - n\\,\\omega_{\\phi} - m\\,\\omega_{\\theta} $$\nThis is the Doppler-shifted frequency of the perturbation as observed in the frame of the rotating plasma at the rational surface.\n\nSecond, we explain the role of this effective frequency in the resonance condition. In single-fluid resistive MHD, an externally applied static magnetic perturbation can only penetrate into the plasma and cause magnetic reconnection at a rational surface (where $q=m/n$) if the perturbation is nearly stationary in the plasma's local rest frame. If the effective frequency $\\omega_{eff}$ is large, the highly conductive plasma generates shielding currents at the rational surface that cancel the applied perturbation, a phenomenon known as flow-screening. This prevents the perturbation from reconnecting magnetic field lines. Magnetic reconnection is most efficient when the plasma has time to respond, which requires the perturbation to be quasi-static in its frame. Therefore, the condition for a strong resonant interaction is not that the applied frequency is zero ($\\omega=0$), but that the effective frequency in the plasma frame is close to zero:\n$$ \\omega_{eff} \\approx 0 \\implies \\omega - n\\,\\omega_{\\phi} - m\\,\\omega_{\\theta} \\approx 0 $$\nThe resonance is thus shifted by the Doppler term $n\\,\\omega_{\\phi} + m\\,\\omega_{\\theta}$, which depends on the plasma rotation and the mode numbers of the perturbation. The detuning from perfect resonance is given by the value of $\\omega_{eff}$.\n\nThird, we calculate the detuning angular frequency $\\Delta\\omega$ for the given scenario.
