No numerical evaluation is required, and no intermediate or shortcut formulas for $P_{\\alpha}$ should be assumed without derivation.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in kinetic theory and plasma physics, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent setup for a standard theoretical derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive a closed-form relationship between the kinetic energy density of alpha particles, $u_{\\alpha}$, and their pressure, $P_{\\alpha}$, under the specified conditions of an isotropic, steady-state distribution with zero bulk flow. The derivation must originate from the first principles of kinetic theory as requested.\n\nThe kinetic energy density, $u_{\\alpha}$, is defined in the problem statement as:\n$$\nu_{\\alpha} \\equiv \\int \\frac{1}{2} m_{\\alpha} v^{2} f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v\n$$\nwhere $m_{\\alpha}$ is the alpha particle mass, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector, $v = |\\mathbf{v}|$ is the speed, and $f(\\mathbf{v})$ is the alpha particle velocity distribution function. We can rewrite this definition by factoring out the constants:\n$$\nu_{\\alpha} = \\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{2} \\int v^{2} f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the kinetic definition of pressure. The problem directs us to start from the momentum flux tensor, $\\mathbf{\\Pi}_{\\alpha}$. For a particle species with mass $m_{\\alpha}$ and distribution function $f(\\mathbf{v})$, the components of the momentum flux tensor are given by:\n$$\n\\Pi_{ij} = \\int m_{\\alpha} (v_i - \\langle v_i \\rangle)(v_j - \\langle v_j \\rangle) f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v\n$$\nwhere $v_i$ are the Cartesian components of the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$, and $\\langle \\mathbf{v} \\rangle$ is the bulk flow velocity. The problem states that the alpha population has no bulk flow, so $\\langle \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}$. The definition of the momentum flux tensor simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Pi_{ij} = m_{\\alpha} \\int v_i v_j f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the pressure $P_{\\alpha}$ as the isotropic part of this tensor. For a general fluid, the scalar pressure $P$ is defined as one-third of the trace of the momentum flux tensor. This definition isolates the isotropic component of momentum flux. Thus, for the alpha particles:\n$$\nP_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{\\Pi}_{\\alpha}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Pi_{ii}\n$$\nSubstituting the integral expression for $\\Pi_{ii}$:\n$$\nP_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( m_{\\alpha} \\int v_i^2 f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v \\right)\n$$\nWe can move the summation inside the integral since the integration is over the velocity space domain, independent of the component index $i$:\n$$\nP_{\\alpha} = \\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{3} \\int \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} v_i^2 \\right) f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v\n$$\nThe sum of the squares of the velocity components is the square of the speed: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} v_i^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 = v^2$. This yields the kinetic expression for pressure:\n$$\nP_{\\alpha} = \\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{3} \\int v^2 f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v\n$$\nThis relation holds true because the distribution function $f(\\mathbf{v})$ is stated to be isotropic, i.e., $f(\\mathbf{v}) = f(v)$. For such a distribution, the off-diagonal components of the momentum flux tensor, like $\\Pi_{xy} = m_{\\alpha} \\int v_x v_y f(v) d^3v$, are zero due to symmetry upon integration over velocity directions. The diagonal elements are equal, $\\Pi_{xx} = \\Pi_{yy} = \\Pi_{zz}$, which makes the tensor $\\mathbf{\\Pi}_{\\alpha}$ purely isotropic, $\\mathbf{\\Pi}_{\\alpha} = P_{\\alpha} \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor. Our derivation for the scalar pressure $P_{\\alpha}$ is therefore exact under the given conditions.\n\nWe now have two expressions derived from first principles:\n$1$. The kinetic energy density: $u_{\\alpha} = \\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{2} \\int v^{2} f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v$\n$2$. The pressure: $P_{\\alpha} = \\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{3} \\int v^{2} f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v$\n\nBoth $u_{\\alpha}$ and $P_{\\alpha}$ are proportional to the same integral quantity, $\\int v^{2} f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v$. This is the key to finding a relationship between them that is independent of the specific functional form of the slowing-down distribution $f(v)$.\n\nFrom the expression for pressure, we can express the integral term as:\n$$\n\\int v^{2} f(\\mathbf{v})\\,d^{3}v = \\frac{3 P_{\\alpha}}{m_{\\alpha}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the kinetic energy density:\n$$\nu_{\\alpha} = \\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{2} \\left( \\frac{3 P_{\\alpha}}{m_{\\alpha}} \\right)\n$$\nThe mass $m_{\\alpha}$ cancels, leading to the final relation:\n$$\nu_{\\alpha} = \\frac{3}{2} P_{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis result is a fundamental relation for any non-relativistic particle population whose velocity distribution is isotropic and has zero mean velocity.
