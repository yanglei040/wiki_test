The problem specifies that only the Lorentz force and the ion pressure gradient force are to be retained in the radial force balance. This implies that inertial terms, viscous forces, and ion-electron friction are considered negligible for this problem's scope.

Given axisymmetry, we assume the electric field is purely radial, $\\mathbf{E} = E_r(r) \\mathbf{e}_r$, and the pressure is a function of the minor radius only, $p_i = p_i(r)$, leading to a radial pressure gradient, $\\nabla p_i = \\frac{dp_i}{dr} \\mathbf{e}_r$.

We proceed to solve the problem and evaluate the options.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe steady-state TAM balance equation is $\\frac{d\\Gamma_L}{dr} = S(r)$. We integrate this equation from $r=0$ to an arbitrary radius $r$:\n$$ \\int_0^r \\frac{d\\Gamma_L}{dr'} dr' = \\int_0^r S(r') dr' $$\n$$ \\Gamma_L(r) - \\Gamma_L(0) = \\int_0^r S_0 \\delta(r' - r_0) dr' $$\nUsing the boundary condition $\\Gamma_L(0) = 0$ and the property of the Dirac delta function, we find the TAM flux profile:\n$$ \\Gamma_L(r) = S_0 H(r - r_0) $$\nwhere $H$ is the Heaviside step function. This means:\n-   For $0 \\le r < r_0$, $\\Gamma_L(r) = 0$.\n-   For $r_0 < r \\le a$, $\\Gamma_L(r) = S_0$.\n\nThis result separates the problem into two regions.\n\n**Region 1: Core ($0 \\le r < r_0$)**\nIn this region, $\\Gamma_L(r) = 0$. The flux balance is:\n$$ -\\chi_{\\phi}\\frac{dL}{dr} + V_p L = 0 \\implies \\frac{dL}{dr} = \\frac{V_p}{\\chi_{\\phi}} L $$\n\n**Region 2: Edge ($r_0 < r \\le a$)**\nIn this region, $\\Gamma_L(r) = S_0$. The flux balance is:\n$$ -\\chi_{\\phi}\\frac{dL}{dr} + V_p L = S_0 \\implies \\frac{dL}{dr} = \\frac{V_p}{\\chi_{\\phi}} L - \\frac{S_0}{\\chi_{\\phi}} $$\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Aiming the NBI to deposit at $r/a \\sim 0.4$ shifts the primary torque source to $r_0$, but an inward momentum pinch with $V_p<0$ can advect TAM inward so that the steady-state $L(r)$ peaks on-axis ($r\\approx 0$) even without any on-axis source.**\n\nTo evaluate this, we consider an inward pinch, $V_p < 0$. The momentum diffusivity $\\chi_{\\phi}$ is a positive quantity. Since the torque source $S_0$ is positive and the momentum density is clamped at $L(a)=0$, the TAM density $L(r)$ must be non-negative everywhere, $L(r) \\ge 0$.\nIn the core region ($0 \\le r < r_0$), we have $\\frac{dL}{dr} = \\frac{V_p}{\\chi_{\\phi}} L$.\nSince $V_p < 0$, $\\chi_{\\phi} > 0$, and $L(r) > 0$ for $r<a$, it follows that $\\frac{dL}{dr} < 0$. A negative derivative means that $L(r)$ is a strictly decreasing function in the range $r \\in [0, r_0)$.\nThis implies that the maximum value of $L(r)$ within this region (and, as it turns out, across the entire domain) occurs at $r=0$. The inward convective flux $V_p L$ (which is negative, i.e., inward) must be balanced by an outward diffusive flux $-\\chi_{\\phi} dL/dr$ to maintain zero net flux in the source-free core. An outward diffusive flux requires $dL/dr < 0$, meaning the profile must peak towards the center. The statement accurately describes this physical mechanism. Thus, an inward pinch causes on-axis peaking of the TAM profile even with an off-axis source.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. If $V_p=0$ (purely diffusive transport) and $S(r)$ is localized at $r_0$, the steady-state solution necessarily has $L(0) > L(r_0)$, i.e., off-axis deposition produces a strict on-axis maximum larger than the value at the source location.**\n\nWe set $V_p = 0$. The transport is purely diffusive.\nIn the core region ($0 \\le r < r_0$), the flux equation becomes $-\\chi_{\\phi}\\frac{dL}{dr} = 0$. Since $\\chi_{\\phi} \\neq 0$, we have $\\frac{dL}{dr} = 0$.\nThis implies that $L(r)$ is constant throughout the core region, $L(r) = C$ for $0 \\le r \\le r_0$. Consequently, $L(0) = L(r_0)$. The statement claims a strict inequality $L(0) > L(r_0)$, which is false. In this purely diffusive case, the profile is flat from the axis out to the source location.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A sufficient condition for robust on-axis peaking under off-axis torque is that the pinch length $L_{\\mathrm{pinch}}=\\chi_{\\phi}/|V_p|$ is shorter than the machine size, i.e., $|V_p|/\\chi_{\\phi} \\gtrsim 1/a$; in this regime the convective term dominates over diffusion on scale $a$ and carries TAM inward efficiently.**\n\nAs shown in the analysis of option A, *any* inward pinch ($V_p < 0$, or $|V_p| > 0$) is a sufficient condition to have the maximum of $L(r)$ at $r=0$. Therefore, the condition given in this statement, $|V_p|/\\chi_{\\phi} \\gtrsim 1/a$, which is a stronger requirement than just $|V_p| > 0$, is also mathematically a sufficient condition.\nThe term \"robust\" implies a physically significant effect. The degree of peaking can be quantified by the ratio $L(0)/L(r_0)$. The solution in the core is $L(r) = C \\exp(\\frac{V_p}{\\chi_{\\phi}} r)$.\nThe peaking factor is thus $L(0)/L(r_0) = \\exp(-\\frac{V_p}{\\chi_{\\phi}} r_0) = \\exp(\\frac{|V_p|}{\\chi_{\\phi}} r_0)$.\nThe ratio $|V_p|/\\chi_{\\phi}$ is the inverse of the pinch length scale, $1/L_{\\text{pinch}}$. A large value of this ratio (i.e., a small pinch length) leads to strong peaking. The condition $|V_p|/\\chi_{\\phi} \\gtrsim 1/a$ can be rewritten as $a/L_{\\text{pinch}} \\gtrsim 1$. The dimensionless quantity $Pe = |V_p|a/\\chi_{\\phi}$ is the Péclet number, which compares the rate of convective transport to diffusive transport over the system scale $a$. $Pe \\gtrsim 1$ is the standard condition for convection to dominate diffusion. This domination by convection is what \"carries TAM inward efficiently\" and leads to a \"robust\" (i.e., strong) on-axis peak. The physical reasoning in the statement is sound and correctly identifies the condition for a strong pinch effect.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Because the torque source is off-axis, conservation of angular momentum forbids any increase of core rotation unless the NBI intersects the magnetic axis; thus on-axis rotation peaking cannot occur without $S(r)$ near $r=0$.**\n\nThis statement is a direct contradiction of the result found for option A. The analysis for A demonstrates that an inward pinch ($V_p < 0$) provides a physical mechanism to transport angular momentum from the off-axis source at $r_0$ inward to the core. This inward transport leads to an accumulation of angular momentum at the center, causing $L(r)$ to peak at $r=0$. The statement's reasoning is flawed because it implicitly assumes transport is purely diffusive (i.e., always down-gradient). The presence of the convective pinch term $V_p L$ in the transport model, which is explicitly allowed by the problem statement, enables this \"uphill\" transport and central peaking. Therefore, conservation of angular momentum, when combined with a pinch, does not forbid on-axis peaking; in fact, it necessitates it to maintain zero flux in the core.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3710549"}, {"introduction": "The transport model for momentum involves coefficients like momentum diffusivity, $\\chi_\\phi$, which must be determined experimentally.

While a frequency-domain (phasor) method is the most direct a-pproach, the prompt requests the use of a Green's function formalism.\n\nLet the linear operator be $\\mathcal{D} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\chi_\\phi L$, where $L = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r})$. The equation is $\\mathcal{D}[\\omega_\\phi] = \\frac{S_L}{\\rho_m R^2}$. The solution can be expressed as a convolution of the source with the Green's function $G(r, t; r', t')$, which is the fundamental solution to the equation:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\chi_\\phi L_r \\right) G(r, t; r', t') = \\delta(t-t')\\frac{\\delta(r-r')}{r'}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\delta(r-r')}{r'}$ is the Dirac delta function in cylindrical coordinates, satisfying $\\int_0^a r' \\frac{\\delta(r-r')}{r'} dr' = 1$. The Green's function must also satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions.\n\nWe can construct the Green's function by expanding it in the complete, orthogonal set of eigenfunctions $V_n(r) = J_0(k_n r)$ of the spatial operator $L$.

Let $\\alpha = \\chi_\\phi k_1^2$. The integral is:\n$$\nI(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} e^{-\\alpha(t-t')} \\cos(\\Omega t') dt'\n$$\nThis integral can be computed more easily by using complex exponentials, where $\\cos(\\Omega t') = \\text{Re}[e^{i\\Omega t'}]$.\n$$\nI(t) = \\text{Re} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} e^{-\\alpha(t-t')} e^{i\\Omega t'} dt' \\right] = \\text{Re} \\left[ e^{-\\alpha t} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} e^{(\\alpha + i\\Omega)t'} dt' \\right]\n$$\n$$\nI(t) = \\text{Re} \\left[ e^{-\\alpha t} \\left[ \\frac{e^{(\\alpha + i\\Omega)t'}}{\\alpha + i\\Omega} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{t} \\right] = \\text{Re} \\left[ e^{-\\alpha t} \\frac{e^{(\\alpha + i\\Omega)t}}{\\alpha + i\\Omega} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nI(t) = \\text{Re} \\left[ \\frac{e^{i\\Omega t}}{\\alpha + i\\Omega} \\right]\n$$\nNow, we express the complex number in the denominator in polar form.
