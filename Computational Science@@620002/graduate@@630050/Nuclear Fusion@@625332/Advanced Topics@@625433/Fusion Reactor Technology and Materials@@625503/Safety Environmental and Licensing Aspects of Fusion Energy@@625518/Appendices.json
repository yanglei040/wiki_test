We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the required thickness of a concrete biological shield to attenuate a forward-going neutron current. We begin by deriving the functional dependence of the neutron current $I$ on the penetration depth $x$ into the shield.\n\nLet $I(x)$ represent the forward-going neutron current density at a depth $x$ within the shield. The shield entrance corresponds to $x=0$, where the incident current density is $I(0) = I_{0}$. We consider a differential slab of thickness $dx$ located at position $x$. The change in the neutron current density, $dI$, as the beam passes through this slab is due to neutrons being removed from the forward-going beam.\n\nThe problem defines the macroscopic removal cross section, $\\Sigma_{R}$, as the effective total probability per unit path length for neutrons to be removed from the uncollided forward-going beam. Thus, the rate of removal of neutrons per unit volume is proportional to the local neutron current density $I(x)$ and the cross section $\\Sigma_{R}$. For a slab of area $A$ and thickness $dx$, the number of neutrons entering per unit time is $I(x)A$. The number of neutrons removed within the volume $Adx$ is $(\\Sigma_{R} I(x)) (A dx)$. This removal corresponds to the decrease in the forward-going current.\n\nThe balance of neutron current across the differential slab from $x$ to $x+dx$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Current out} - \\text{Current in} = -\\text{Current removed}\n$$\n$$\nI(x+dx) - I(x) = - (\\Sigma_{R} I(x)) dx\n$$\nThe term $I(x+dx)$ can be expanded in a Taylor series about $x$ as $I(x+dx) \\approx I(x) + \\frac{dI}{dx}dx$. Substituting this into the balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\left(I(x) + \\frac{dI}{dx}dx\\right) - I(x) = - \\Sigma_{R} I(x) dx\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dx}dx = - \\Sigma_{R} I(x) dx\n$$\nDividing by $dx$ (for $dx \\neq 0$), we obtain the first-order ordinary differential equation that models the attenuation of the forward-going current:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dx} = - \\Sigma_{R} I(x)\n$$\nThis equation is separable. We rearrange it to separate the variables $I$ and $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{I} = - \\Sigma_{R} dx\n$$\nTo find the functional dependence of $I$ on $x$, we integrate this equation from the shield entrance ($x=0$, $I=I_{0}$) to an arbitrary depth $x$ within the shield (where the current is $I(x)$):\n$$\n\\int_{I_{0}}^{I(x)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = \\int_{0}^{x} - \\Sigma_{R} dx'\n$$\nSince $\\Sigma_{R}$ is constant for a homogeneous material, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{I_{0}}^{I(x)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = - \\Sigma_{R} \\int_{0}^{x} dx'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ \\ln(I') \\right]_{I_{0}}^{I(x)} = - \\Sigma_{R} \\left[ x' \\right]_{0}^{x}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(I(x)) - \\ln(I_{0}) = - \\Sigma_{R} (x - 0)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(x)}{I_{0}}\\right) = - \\Sigma_{R} x\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the functional dependence of the forward-going neutron current on the slab thickness $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{I(x)}{I_{0}} = \\exp(-\\Sigma_{R} x)\n$$\nor\n$$\nI(x) = I_{0} \\exp(-\\Sigma_{R} x)\n$$\nThis is the well-known exponential attenuation law (Beer-Lambert law).\n\nNext, we must find the slab thickness $x$ required to meet the design criterion. The criterion is that the ratio of the exit current $I$ to the incident current $I_{0}$ is $I/I_{0} = 10^{-3}$. Here, $I$ is the current at the shield's outer face, so $I = I(x)$. We set the attenuation factor equal to the required value:\n$$\n\\frac{I(x)}{I_{0}} = \\exp(-\\Sigma_{R} x) = 10^{-3}\n$$\nTo solve for $x$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(\\exp(-\\Sigma_{R} x)) = \\ln(10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\n- \\Sigma_{R} x = -3 \\ln(10)\n$$\nSolving for the thickness $x$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{3 \\ln(10)}{\\Sigma_{R}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value for the macroscopic removal cross section, $\\Sigma_{R} = 0.08\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$\nx = \\frac{3 \\ln(10)}{0.08\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nx \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 2.302585}{0.08} \\text{ cm}\n$$\n$$\nx \\approx \\frac{6.907755}{0.08} \\text{ cm}\n$$\n$$\nx \\approx 86.3469375 \\text{ cm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nx \\approx 86.35 \\text{ cm}\n$$\nThis is the required thickness of the concrete shield to meet the licensing constraint.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{86.35}$$", "id": "3717676"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the immediate threat of prompt radiation, fusion safety is deeply concerned with the containment of radioactive materials, principally tritium.
