Before designing the vast balance of plant, we must first establish a consistent power balance for the plasma core. This practice applies the principle of energy conservation to a plasma in steady-state, balancing the heating from fusion alpha particles and external systems against energy losses. By performing this fundamental check, you will verify a viable plasma operating point and calculate the crucial figure of merit, the plasma energy gain $Q_{\\text{plasma}}$, which measures the plasma's effectiveness as a power amplifier [@problem_id:3700368].", "problem": "A deuterium-tritium tokamak power plant concept is being assessed for its plasma-side energy balance prior to sizing the Balance of Plant (BOP).

The deuterium-tritium (D-T) reaction, $D + T \\rightarrow \\alpha + n$, produces fusion products with total energy of $17.6\\,\\text{MeV}$, of which the alpha particle ($\\alpha$) carries $3.5\\,\\text{MeV}$.

The power levels are representative of a demonstration power plant like ITER. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information. Task 1 explicitly requires a consistency check, which is a part of the validation process itself. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n#### Part 1: Consistency Check\nThe analysis is based on the principle of conservation of energy applied to the plasma as a control volume. For a system in steady state, the total power input must equal the total power output. The rate of change of the plasma's internal energy, $W$, is zero:\n$$ \\frac{dW}{dt} = \\sum P_{\\text{heating}} - \\sum P_{\\text{loss}} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the sum of all heating powers must balance the sum of all power losses:\n$$ \\sum P_{\\text{heating}} = \\sum P_{\\text{loss}} $$\nThe power sources (heating) for the plasma are:\n1.  **Alpha-particle heating ($P_{\\alpha}$)**: The charged alpha particles produced by fusion reactions are confined by the magnetic field and deposit their kinetic energy into the plasma. The total fusion power is given as $P_{\\text{fusion}}$. A fraction $f_{\\alpha}$ of this power is contained in the alpha particles. The problem assumes all of this energy is deposited in the plasma. Therefore, the alpha heating power is:\n    $$ P_{\\alpha} = f_{\\alpha} P_{\\text{fusion}} $$\n2.  **Auxiliary heating ($P_{\\text{aux}}$)**: This is external power injected into the plasma to raise its temperature to fusion conditions.\n\nThe power sink (loss) is the total plasma power loss, $P_{\\text{loss}}$, which lumps together losses due to transport (conduction and convection) and radiation (like bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation).\n\nThe steady-state energy balance equation is therefore:\n$$ P_{\\alpha} + P_{\\text{aux}} = P_{\\text{loss}} $$\nWe can now substitute the given values to check for consistency.\nFirst, calculate the alpha heating power:\n$$ P_{\\alpha} = 0.2 \\times 500\\,\\text{MW} = 100\\,\\text{MW} $$\nNow, substitute this into the energy balance equation:\n$$ 100\\,\\text{MW} + 50\\,\\text{MW} = 150\\,\\text{MW} $$\n$$ 150\\,\\text{MW} = 150\\,\\text{MW} $$\nThe total heating power ($150\\,\\text{MW}$) is exactly equal to the total power loss ($150\\,\\text{MW}$). Thus, the given parameters $P_{\\text{fusion}}$, $f_{\\alpha}$, $P_{\\text{aux}}$, and $P_{\\text{loss}}$ are mutually consistent under the steady-state assumption.\n\n#### Part 2: Calculation of Plasma Energy Gain ($Q_{\\text{plasma}}$)\nThe problem defines the plasma energy gain, $Q_{\\text{plasma}}$, as the ratio of the total fusion power produced in the plasma to the externally injected auxiliary power.\n$$ Q_{\\text{plasma}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{fusion}}}{P_{\\text{aux}}} $$\nUsing the provided values:\n- $P_{\\text{fusion}} = 500\\,\\text{MW}$\n- $P_{\\text{aux}} = 50\\,\\text{MW}$\n\nWe can compute $Q_{\\text{plasma}}$:\n$$ Q_{\\text{plasma}} = \\frac{500\\,\\text{MW}}{50\\,\\text{MW}} = 10 $$\nThe plasma energy gain $Q_{\\text{plasma}}$ is a dimensionless quantity. A value of $Q_{\\text{plasma}}=10$ is a significant milestone for fusion energy, often cited as the target for devices like ITER, as it represents a plasma that produces ten times more power from fusion reactions than is injected to heat it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "3700368"}, {"introduction": "Once the plasma produces power, that energy must be safely contained and extracted. The first wall, the material surface closest to the plasma, faces some of the most extreme conditions in the reactor.

The problem is objective, using precise technical language and providing all necessary data for a solution. The numerical values are physically plausible for a high-heat-flux component. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe heat transport in the slab is governed by the one-dimensional steady-state heat conduction equation with no internal heat generation. Let us define a coordinate system where $x=0$ is the plasma-facing inner surface and $x=t$ is the coolant-side outer surface. The general heat conduction equation simplifies under the given assumptions:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(k \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) = 0 $$\nSince the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, this further simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $x$ gives the general solution for the temperature profile $T(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = C_1 $$\n$$ T(x) = C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is at the plasma-facing surface, $x=0$, which is subjected to a constant heat flux $q''$. According to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux in the $x$-direction is $q''_x = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$. At $x=0$, this flux is equal to the imposed surface flux, $q''$.\n$$ q'' = -k \\left.\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right|_{x=0} $$\nSubstituting $\\frac{dT}{dx} = C_1$, we find:\n$$ q'' = -k C_1 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{q''}{k} $$\n\nThe second boundary condition is at the coolant-side surface, $x=t$. At steady state, the heat conducted to this surface must be equal to the heat convected away to the coolant. The heat flux conducted to the surface is $q''$ (since there is no heat generation, the flux is constant throughout the slab). The heat convected away is given by Newton's law of cooling, $q''_{\\text{conv}} = h(T(t) - T_{\\text{film}})$.\n$$ q'' = h(T(t) - T_{\\text{film}}) $$\nThis allows us to express the temperature at the outer wall, $T(t)$, as:\n$$ T(t) = T_{\\text{film}} + \\frac{q''}{h} $$\nNow we use the general solution $T(x) = C_1 x + C_2$ at $x=t$ and substitute the value of $C_1$:\n$$ T(t) = \\left(-\\frac{q''}{k}\\right)t + C_2 $$\nEquating the two expressions for $T(t)$ allows us to solve for $C_2$:\n$$ T_{\\text{film}} + \\frac{q''}{h} = -\\frac{q''t}{k} + C_2 $$\n$$ C_2 = T_{\\text{film}} + \\frac{q''}{h} + \\frac{q''t}{k} $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $T(x)$ gives the complete temperature profile:\n$$ T(x) = \\left(-\\frac{q''}{k}\\right)x + \\left(T_{\\text{film}} + \\frac{q''}{h} + \\frac{q''t}{k}\\right) $$\nRearranging the terms yields:\n$$ T(x) = T_{\\text{film}} + \\frac{q''}{h} + \\frac{q''}{k}(t-x) = T_{\\text{film}} + q''\\left(\\frac{1}{h} + \\frac{t-x}{k}\\right) $$\nThe temperature profile is a linear function of $x$ with a negative slope, $-\\frac{q''}{k}$. Therefore, the maximum temperature, $T_{\\max}$, occurs at the surface where $x$ is minimum, which is the plasma-facing surface at $x=0$.\n$$ T_{\\max} = T(0) = T_{\\text{film}} + q''\\left(\\frac{1}{h} + \\frac{t-0}{k}\\right) $$\nThe expression for the maximum wall temperature is:\n$$ T_{\\max} = T_{\\text{film}} + q''\\left(\\frac{t}{k} + \\frac{1}{h}\\right) $$\nThis result can be interpreted as the sum of the coolant temperature, the temperature rise across the convective film ($\\Delta T_{\\text{conv}} = q''/h$), and the temperature rise across the slab thickness ($\\Delta T_{\\text{cond}} = q''t/k$).\n\nNext, we impose the material limit, $T_{\\max} \\leq T_{\\text{allow}}$, to find the maximum allowable thickness, $t_{\\max}$.\n$$ T_{\\text{film}} + q''\\left(\\frac{t}{k} + \\frac{1}{h}\\right) \\leq T_{\\text{allow}} $$\nWe solve this inequality for the thickness $t$.\n$$ q''\\left(\\frac{t}{k} + \\frac{1}{h}\\right) \\leq T_{\\text{allow}} - T_{\\text{film}} $$\n$$ \\frac{t}{k} + \\frac{1}{h} \\leq \\frac{T_{\\text{allow}} - T_{\\text{film}}}{q''} $$\n$$ \\frac{t}{k} \\leq \\frac{T_{\\text{allow}} - T_{\\text{film}}}{q''} - \\frac{1}{h} $$\nSince $k$ is positive, multiplying by it does not change the inequality direction.\n$$ t \\leq k\\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{allow}} - T_{\\text{film}}}{q''} - \\frac{1}{h}\\right) $$\nThe maximum allowable thickness, $t_{\\max}$, corresponds to the equality:\n$$ t_{\\max} = k\\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{allow}} - T_{\\text{film}}}{q''} - \\frac{1}{h}\\right) $$\n\nFinally, we evaluate $t_{\\max}$ using the given numerical values:\n$k = 120\\,\\text{W}/\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{K}$\n$q'' = 5.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{W}/\\text{m}^{2}$\n$h = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{W}/\\text{m}^{2}\\cdot\\text{K}$\n$T_{\\text{film}} = 550\\,\\text{K}$\n$T_{\\text{allow}} = 1400\\,\\text{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t_{\\max}$:\n$$ t_{\\max} = 120\\,\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{K}} \\left( \\frac{(1400 - 550)\\,\\text{K}}{5.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{m}^2}} - \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{K}}} \\right) $$\n$$ t_{\\max} = 120 \\left( \\frac{850}{5.0 \\times 10^{6}} - \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{4}} \\right) \\,\\text{m} $$\n$$ t_{\\max} = 120 \\left( 1.7 \\times 10^{-4} - 0.3333... \\times 10^{-4} \\right) \\,\\text{m} $$\n$$ t_{\\max} = 120 \\left( 1.3666... \\times 10^{-4} \\right) \\,\\text{m} $$\n$$ t_{\\max} = 0.0164 \\,\\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters.\n$$ t_{\\max} = 0.0164 \\,\\text{m} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\text{mm}}{1\\,\\text{m}} = 16.4 \\,\\text{mm} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $16.40\\,\\text{mm}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{16.40} $$", "id": "3700370"}, {"introduction": "A successful fusion power plant requires not only a high-performance reactor but also an efficient balance of plant.
