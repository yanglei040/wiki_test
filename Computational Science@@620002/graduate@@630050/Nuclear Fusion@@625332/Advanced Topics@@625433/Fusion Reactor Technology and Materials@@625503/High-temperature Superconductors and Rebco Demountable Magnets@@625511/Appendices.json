This margin represents the maximum temperature increase the conductor can withstand at its operating current density before it starts to transition out of the fully superconducting state.\n\n1.  **Definition of Temperature Margin**:\n    The superconducting state is maintained as long as the operating current density $J$ is less than the critical current density $J_c$. The critical current density $J_c$ is a function of temperature $T$ (at a fixed magnetic field). As temperature increases, $J_c(T)$ decreases. The \"current-sharing temperature\", denoted $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$, is the specific temperature at which the critical current density becomes equal to the operating current density.\n    $$\n    J_c(T_{\\mathrm{cs}}) = J\n    $$\n    If the conductor's temperature rises above $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$, then $J_c(T) < J$, and the superconductor can no longer carry the full current $J$ without dissipation. Part of the current is \"shared\" with the normally conducting stabilizer matrix (e.g., copper), leading to Joule heating and a potential thermal runaway (quench).\n\n    The temperature margin, $\\Delta T_m$, is therefore defined as the difference between the current-sharing temperature and the operating temperature:\n    $$\n    \\Delta T_m = T_{\\mathrm{cs}} - T_{\\mathrm{op}}\n    $$\n    This value represents the maximum allowable local temperature rise, $\\Delta T$, from a disturbance before the onset of resistance. For stability, any thermal disturbance must satisfy $\\Delta T \\le \\Delta T_m$. The energy required to raise the temperature by this amount is the enthalpy margin, given by $\\Delta H = \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}} c(T)\\, dT$, where $c(T)$ is the volumetric heat capacity of the composite conductor.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Temperature Margin**:\n    We are given:\n    - $J = 400~\\mathrm{A/mm^2}$\n    - $T_{\\mathrm{op}} = 20~\\mathrm{K}$\n    - $J_c(T) = 500~\\mathrm{A/mm^2}\\,\\bigg[\\,1 - \\Big(\\tfrac{T}{90~\\mathrm{K}}\\Big)^{3/2}\\,\\bigg]$\n\n    First, we find $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$ by setting $J_c(T_{\\mathrm{cs}}) = J$:\n    $$\n    400~\\mathrm{A/mm^2} = 500~\\mathrm{A/mm^2}\\,\\bigg[\\,1 - \\Big(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{90~\\mathrm{K}}\\Big)^{3/2}\\,\\bigg]\n    $$\n    Dividing by $500~\\mathrm{A/mm^2}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{400}{500} = 0.8 = 1 - \\Big(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{90}\\Big)^{3/2}\n    $$\n    Rearranging the terms to solve for the temperature-dependent part:\n    $$\n    \\Big(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{90}\\Big)^{3/2} = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2\n    $$\n    Now, we solve for $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{90} = (0.2)^{2/3}\n    $$\n    $$\n    T_{\\mathrm{cs}} = 90 \\times (0.2)^{2/3}~\\mathrm{K}\n    $$\n    Calculating the numerical value:\n    $$\n    (0.2)^{2/3} \\approx 0.341995\n    $$\n    $$\n    T_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx 90 \\times 0.341995~\\mathrm{K} \\approx 30.7796~\\mathrm{K}\n    $$\n    Rounding to one decimal place, $T_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx 30.8~\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n    Now, we compute the temperature margin, $\\Delta T_m$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta T_m = T_{\\mathrm{cs}} - T_{\\mathrm{op}} \\approx 30.8~\\mathrm{K} - 20~\\mathrm{K} = 10.8~\\mathrm{K}\n    $$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The temperature margin is the difference $T_{\\mathrm{cs}} - T_{\\mathrm{op}}$, where $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$ is the temperature at which $J_c(T_{\\mathrm{cs}}) = J$ at fixed field and strain. For the given data, $T_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx 30.8~\\mathrm{K}$, so the margin is $\\approx 10.8~\\mathrm{K}$. Any local disturbance that raises the conductor temperature by $\\Delta T$ must satisfy $\\Delta T \\leq T_{\\mathrm{cs}} - T_{\\mathrm{op}}$ to avoid onset of current sharing; the corresponding energy allowance per unit volume is the enthalpy margin $\\int_{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{cs}}} c(T)\\, dT$, where $c(T)$ is the effective volumetric heat capacity of the composite.**\n\n-   **Definition**: The definition of temperature margin as $T_{\\mathrm{cs}} - T_{\\mathrm{op}}$, where $J_c(T_{\\mathrm{cs}}) = J$, is correct.\n-   **Calculation**: The calculated values $T_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx 30.8~\\mathrm{K}$ and margin $\\approx 10.8~\\mathrm{K}$ match our derivation precisely.\n-   **Explanation**: The explanation of how the margin constrains thermal disturbances ($\\Delta T \\le T_{\\mathrm{cs}} - T_{\\mathrm{op}}$) and the correct identification of the enthalpy margin are physically sound and complete.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The temperature margin is $T_c - T_{\\mathrm{op}}$, where $T_c$ is the zero-field superconducting critical temperature, so here it is $90~\\mathrm{K} - 20~\\mathrm{K} = 70~\\mathrm{K}$. Allowable disturbances are set by the excess current density $J_c(20~\\mathrm{K}) - J$ rather than by any temperature rise.**\n\n-   **Definition**: This definition is incorrect. The temperature margin is not simply the difference between the zero-current critical temperature ($T_c$) and the operating temperature. The presence of a high operating current $J$ significantly lowers the temperature at which the transition occurs, from $T_c$ down to $T_{\\mathrm{cs}}$. The value $90~\\mathrm{K}$ is the critical temperature parameter at zero current for the given fixed field, not the upper boundary for operation with $J = 400~\\mathrm{A/mm^2}$.\n-   **Explanation**: The claim that allowable disturbances are set by the current margin ($J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}}) - J$) instead of a temperature rise is incorrect when considering thermal disturbances. The temperature margin is specifically the quantity that quantifies tolerance to temperature increases.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The temperature margin is defined by the linearized relation $\\Delta T \\approx \\big(J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}}) - J\\big)\\big/ \\big|\\tfrac{dJ_c}{dT}\\big|_{T_{\\mathrm{op}}}$, giving $\\Delta T \\approx 12~\\mathrm{K}$, and disturbances are allowable provided $J/J_c(T)$ stays below unity on this linear approximation.**\n\n-   **Definition**: This is a linear approximation of the temperature margin, not its fundamental definition. This can be derived from a first-order Taylor expansion: $J(T_{\\mathrm{op}} + \\Delta T) \\approx J_c(T_{\\mathrm{op}}) + \\frac{dJ_c}{dT}\\big|_{T_{\\mathrm{op}}} \\Delta T$. Setting $J(T_{\\mathrm{op}} + \\Delta T) = J$ gives the expression. However, the exact definition uses the full non-linear function. Let's check the calculation.\n    $J_c(20~\\mathrm{K}) = 500 \\bigg[ 1 - \\big(\\frac{20}{90}\\big)^{3/2} \\bigg] \\approx 500(1-0.10475) \\approx 447.6~\\mathrm{A/mm^2}$.\n    $\\frac{dJ_c}{dT} = -500 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{T^{1/2}}{90^{3/2}} = -\\frac{750}{90^{3/2}} T^{1/2}$.\n    At $T=20~\\mathrm{K}$, $\\frac{dJ_c}{dT}\\big|_{20~\\mathrm{K}} = -\\frac{750 \\sqrt{20}}{90 \\sqrt{90}} \\approx -3.93~\\mathrm{A/(mm^2 \\cdot K)}$.\n    $\\Delta T \\approx \\frac{J_c(20~\\mathrm{K}) - J}{|\\frac{dJ_c}{dT}|_{20~\\mathrm{K}}|} \\approx \\frac{447.6 - 400}{3.93} \\approx \\frac{47.6}{3.93} \\approx 12.1~\\mathrm{K}$.\n    The calculation is roughly correct for the approximation. However, the approximation ($12.1~\\mathrm{K}$) differs from the true value ($10.8~\\mathrm{K}$) by over $10\\%$. More importantly, this option presents an approximation as the definition, which is less precise and fundamental than the definition in option A.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. REBCO at $20~\\mathrm{K}$ has negligible temperature dependence of $J_c$, so the temperature margin is undefined; allowable disturbances are controlled primarily by magnetic field ripple rather than thermal excursions.**\n\n-   **Premise**: The claim that $J_c$ has \"negligible\" temperature dependence at $20~\\mathrm{K}$ is contradicted by both the provided formula and our calculation in C, which showed $|\\frac{dJ_c}{dT}| \\approx 3.93~\\mathrm{A/(mm^2 \\cdot K)}$. This dependence is the very reason a temperature margin exists and is finite.\n-   **Conclusion**: Since the premise is false, the conclusion that the temperature margin is \"undefined\" is also false.\n-   **Explanation**: The statement that stability is \"primarily\" controlled by magnetic field ripple is an unsubstantiated diversion. While magnetic stability is a valid concern, thermal stability against local energy depositions (the topic of this problem) is equally critical, and it is quantified by the temperature margin.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3702538"}, {"introduction": "A key safety requirement for any large superconducting magnet is the ability to rapidly and safely dissipate its immense stored magnetic energy during a fault.

We are given the initial current $I_0$ at time $t=0$.\n\nFirst, we apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) to the closed loop. The sum of the voltage drops across the inductor and the resistor must be zero. The constitutive relation for an ideal inductor is $V_L(t) = L \\frac{dI(t)}{dt}$, and for a resistor, it is $V_R(t) = I(t)R_{\\text{dump}}$. According to KVL:\n$$V_L(t) + V_R(t) = 0$$\n$$L \\frac{dI(t)}{dt} + I(t)R_{\\text{dump}} = 0$$\n\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.
