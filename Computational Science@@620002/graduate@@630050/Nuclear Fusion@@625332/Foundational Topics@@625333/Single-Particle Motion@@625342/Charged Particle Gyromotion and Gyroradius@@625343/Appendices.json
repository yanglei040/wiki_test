The particle's motion is governed by Newton's second law with the Lorentz force:\n$$m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$$\nThe velocity can be decomposed into components parallel ($\\vec{v}_{\\|}$) and perpendicular ($\\vec{v}_{\\perp}$) to the magnetic field. The magnetic force acts only on the perpendicular component, causing the particle to execute a circular motion in the plane perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$. This is the gyromotion.\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force, which provides the necessary centripetal force for this circular motion, is given by $F_L = |q|v_{\\perp}B$, since $\\vec{v}_{\\perp}$ is orthogonal to $\\vec{B}$. The centripetal force required for a circular path of radius $r_g$ (the gyroradius) is $F_c = \\frac{mv_{\\perp}^2}{r_g}$.\n\nEquating these two forces yields:\n$$\\frac{mv_{\\perp}^2}{r_g} = |q|v_{\\perp}B$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to find the angular frequency of the gyromotion, known as the cyclotron or gyrofrequency, $\\omega_c$:\n$$\\omega_c = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{r_g} = \\frac{|q|B}{m}$$\nThe gyrating particle constitutes a microscopic current loop. The magnetic moment, $\\mu$, of a current loop is defined as the product of the current $I$ and the area $A$ of the loop:\n$$\\mu = IA$$\nThe current $I$ is the amount of charge passing a point on the loop per unit time. For a single particle, this is the charge $|q|$ divided by the period of one gyration, $T$. The period is related to the gyrofrequency by $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_c}$.\n$$I = \\frac{|q|}{T} = \\frac{|q|\\omega_c}{2\\pi}$$\nThe area of the circular orbit is $A = \\pi r_g^2$. From the force balance equation, we can express the gyroradius as $r_g = \\frac{mv_{\\perp}}{|q|B}$. Substituting this into the area expression gives:\n$$A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{mv_{\\perp}}{|q|B}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi m^2 v_{\\perp}^2}{q^2 B^2}$$\nNow, we can compute the magnetic moment $\\mu$ by substituting the expressions for $I$ and $A$:\n$$\\mu = \\left(\\frac{|q|\\omega_c}{2\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\pi m^2 v_{\\perp}^2}{q^2 B^2}\\right) = \\frac{|q|\\omega_c m^2 v_{\\perp}^2}{2q^2 B^2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_c = \\frac{|q|B}{m}$:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{|q| m^2 v_{\\perp}^2}{2q^2 B^2} \\left(\\frac{|q|B}{m}\\right) = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2B}$$\nThe kinetic energy of the particle associated with its perpendicular motion is $K_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\perp}^2$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\mu$, we arrive at the desired result:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{K_{\\perp}}{B}$$\nThis expression relates the magnetic moment of the gyromotion to the particle's perpendicular kinetic energy and the magnetic field strength.\n\nThe key assumption for this derivation and for $\\mu$ to be a useful quantity (specifically, an adiabatic invariant) is that the magnetic field is nearly static and uniform over the scale of the gyration. This means the gyro-period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega_c$ must be much shorter than the time scale on which $\\vec{B}$ changes, and the gyroradius $r_g$ must be much smaller than the spatial scale length of the magnetic field variation, $L_B = |\\vec{B}| / |\\nabla\\vec{B}|$. Under these conditions, the particle is said to be \"magnetized\".\n\n### Estimation of Thermal-Average Values\nThe problem states the deuterium ions are in thermal equilibrium with an isotropic Maxwellian velocity distribution at a temperature $T_i$. In plasma physics, it is standard to express temperature in units of energy (electron-volts, $\\mathrm{eV}$), where the temperature $T$ actually signifies the quantity $k_B T$. Thus, we are given $k_B T_i = 10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\nAccording to the equipartition theorem, for a system in thermal equilibrium, the average energy per quadratic degree of freedom is $\\frac{1}{2}k_B T_i$. The perpendicular kinetic energy, $K_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_x^2 + v_y^2)$, depends on two independent velocity components and thus corresponds to two degrees of freedom.\n\nTherefore, the thermal-average perpendicular kinetic energy $\\langle K_{\\perp} \\rangle$ is:\n$$\\langle K_{\\perp} \\rangle = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}k_B T_i\\right) = k_B T_i$$\nThe thermal-average magnetic moment, which we denote as $\\langle \\mu \\rangle$, can be found by substituting this average energy into our derived expression:\n$$\\langle \\mu \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle K_{\\perp} \\rangle}{B} = \\frac{k_B T_i}{B}$$\nThe corresponding magnetic moment energy scale is $\\langle \\mu \\rangle B$. Using the expression above:\n$$\\langle \\mu \\rangle B = \\frac{k_B T_i}{B} \\times B = k_B T_i$$\nThis shows that the magnetic moment energy scale is simply equal to the average perpendicular kinetic energy of the ions.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are given:\n- Magnetic field strength, $B=5\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n- Ion thermal energy, $k_B T_i=10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\nFirst, we convert the thermal energy to SI units (Joules, J):\n$$k_B T_i = 10\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 10 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nUsing the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.602177 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$:\n$$k_B T_i = 10^4\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\times (1.602177 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) = 1.602177 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nNow we calculate the thermal-average magnetic moment $\\langle \\mu \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle \\mu \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T_i}{B} = \\frac{1.602177 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{5\\,\\mathrm{T}} = 0.3204354 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J/T} = 3.204354 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J/T}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\langle \\mu \\rangle \\approx 3.20 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J/T}$$\nNext, we calculate the magnetic moment energy scale $\\langle \\mu \\rangle B$ in units of $\\mathrm{keV}$. From our derivation, $\\langle \\mu \\rangle B = k_B T_i$. The value of $k_B T_i$ is given directly as $10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. To express this with three significant figures as requested:\n$$\\langle \\mu \\rangle B = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$$\nThe two requested values are the thermal-average magnetic moment $\\langle \\mu \\rangle$ and the magnetic moment energy $\\langle \\mu \\rangle B$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.20 \\times 10^{-16} & 10.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3693087"}, {"introduction": "The conservation of the magnetic moment has profound consequences for particle confinement, giving rise to the magnetic mirror effect.
