The solution proceeds by first establishing the relationship between the $Q$-value and nuclear binding energy, then applying this relationship to compute the required quantities.\n\n**1. Q-Value and Nuclear Binding Energy**\n\nThe $Q$-value of a nuclear reaction is defined as the difference between the total rest energy of the reactants and the total rest energy of the products. For a generic reaction $R_1 + R_2 \\rightarrow P_1 + P_2$, the $Q$-value is:\n$$Q = \\left( m_{R_1} + m_{R_2} - m_{P_1} - m_{P_2} \\right)c^2$$\nwhere $m$ represents the rest mass of each particle and $c$ is the speed of light. A positive $Q$-value signifies an exothermic reaction where rest mass is converted into kinetic energy.\n\nThe mass of a nucleus with mass number $A$ and atomic number $Z$ is related to the masses of its constituent nucleons (Z protons and N neutrons, where $N=A-Z$) and its total nuclear binding energy, $B(A,Z)$, by the mass-energy equivalence principle:\n$$m(A,Z)c^2 = Z m_p c^2 + N m_n c^2 - B(A,Z)$$\nwhere $m_p$ and $m_n$ are the rest masses of a free proton and a free neutron, respectively.\n\nSubstituting this expression for mass into the $Q$-value equation, we find that the terms corresponding to the masses of the constituent protons and neutrons cancel out, because the total number of protons and the total number of neutrons are each conserved in any nuclear reaction. This leads to a simplified expression for the $Q$-value in terms of binding energies:\n$$Q = \\sum_{i} B_{\\text{products}, i} - \\sum_{j} B_{\\text{reactants}, j}$$\nThis equation states that the energy released in a reaction is equal to the net increase in total binding energy. A more tightly bound system has less mass-energy. According to the problem statement, the binding energy of a free neutron is $B_n = 0$.\n\nThe problem provides average binding energies per nucleon, $\\bar{b}(A)$, for each nuclide. The total binding energy, $B(A)$, is approximated as:\n$$B(A) \\approx A \\times \\bar{b}(A)$$\n\n**2. Calculation for Thermal Fission of $^{235}\\text{U}$**\n\nThe first reaction channel is:\n$$^{235}\\text{U} + n \\rightarrow {}^{141}\\text{Ba} + {}^{92}\\text{Kr} + 3\\,n$$\nThe reactants are one $^{235}\\text{U}$ nucleus and one neutron. The products are one $^{141}\\text{Ba}$ nucleus, one $^{92}\\text{Kr}$ nucleus, and three neutrons. Applying the binding energy formula for the $Q$-value ($Q_{\\text{thermal}}$):\n$$Q_{\\text{thermal}} = \\left( B_{^{141}\\text{Ba}} + B_{^{92}\\text{Kr}} + 3B_n \\right) - \\left( B_{^{235}\\text{U}} + B_n \\right)$$\nSince $B_n = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$Q_{\\text{thermal}} = B_{^{141}\\text{Ba}} + B_{^{92}\\text{Kr}} - B_{^{235}\\text{U}}$$\nWe now use the provided data to calculate the total binding energies:\n$$B_{^{235}\\text{U}} = 235 \\times 7.590\\,\\text{MeV} = 1783.65\\,\\text{MeV}$$\n$$B_{^{141}\\text{Ba}} = 141 \\times 8.288\\,\\text{MeV} = 1168.608\\,\\text{MeV}$$\n$$B_{^{92}\\text{Kr}} = 92 \\times 8.520\\,\\text{MeV} = 783.84\\,\\text{MeV}$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$Q_{\\text{thermal}} = (1168.608 + 783.84) - 1783.65 = 1952.448 - 1783.65 = 168.798\\,\\text{MeV}$$\n\n**3.

The $Q$-value ($Q_{\\text{fast}}$) is the difference in binding energies of the final and initial nuclei, as the binding energy of the neutrons cancels out:\n$$Q_{\\text{fast}} = B_{^{140}\\text{Xe}} + B_{^{96}\\text{Sr}} - B_{^{238}\\text{U}}$$\nUsing the provided data:\n$$B_{^{238}\\text{U}} = 238 \\times 7.570\\,\\text{MeV} = 1801.66\\,\\text{MeV}$$\n$$B_{^{140}\\text{Xe}} = 140 \\times 8.300\\,\\text{MeV} = 1162.00\\,\\text{MeV}$$\n$$B_{^{96}\\text{Sr}} = 96 \\times 8.520\\,\\text{MeV} = 817.92\\,\\text{MeV}$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$Q_{\\text{fast}} = (1162.00 + 817.92) - 1801.66 = 1979.92 - 1801.66 = 178.26\\,\\text{MeV}$$\n\n**4.

Discussion of Excitation Energy and Broader Context**\n\nThe $Q$-value represents the energy released due to the change in rest mass between the ground states of the initial reactants and final products for a *specific* reaction channel. It is a constant for that channel. However, the total energy available to the products is the sum of the $Q$-value and the initial kinetic energy of the reactants in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nWhen a neutron is absorbed by a heavy nucleus (e.g., $^{235}\\text{U}$), it forms a compound nucleus ($^{236}\\text{U}^*$) in an excited state. The excitation energy ($E^*$) is approximately the sum of the binding energy of the last neutron in the compound nucleus and the kinetic energy of the incident neutron ($K_n$): $E^* \\approx B_n(\\text{compound}) + K_n$. Fission occurs if this excitation energy exceeds the nucleus's fission barrier.\n- For $^{235}\\text{U} + n \\rightarrow {}^{236}\\text{U}^*$, the binding energy of the captured neutron ($B_n(^{236}\\text{U}) \\approx 6.5\\ \\text{MeV}$) is greater than the fission barrier ($E_f \\approx 5.5\\ \\text{MeV}$). Thus, even a thermal neutron with $K_n \\approx 0$ can induce fission.\n- For $^{238}\\text{U} + n \\rightarrow {}^{239}\\text{U}^*$, the neutron binding energy ($B_n(^{239}\\text{U}) \\approx 4.8\\ \\text{MeV}$) is less than the fission barrier ($E_f \\approx 6.5\\ \\text{MeV}$). Therefore, a \"fast\" neutron with significant kinetic energy ($K_n > E_f - B_n \\approx 1.7\\ \\text{MeV}$) is required to provide the additional energy to surmount the barrier.\n\nWhile the $Q$-value for a given product channel is fixed, the initial excitation energy $E^*$ influences the fission dynamics. A higher $E^*$ means the compound nucleus is more energetic before it splits. This additional energy must be partitioned among the fission products. It can result in higher kinetic energies for the fission fragments and prompt neutrons, or the emission of a greater number of prompt neutrons and gamma rays. It does not, however, alter the ground-state-to-ground-state energy difference represented by the $Q$-value.\n\nThis principle of releasing energy by increasing binding energy per nucleon governs both fission and fusion. The binding energy curve shows that $\\bar{b}$ is maximal for nuclei with $A \\approx 56$ (iron group).\n- **Fission:** Heavy nuclei like uranium ($\\bar{b} \\approx 7.6\\,\\text{MeV/nucleon}$) are on the right side of the peak. By splitting into lighter, mid-mass fragments (e.g., Kr, Ba, with $\\bar{b} \\approx 8.5\\,\\text{MeV/nucleon}$), the system \"climbs\" the binding energy curve, releasing the energy difference. Our calculations confirm this, showing a release of $\\sim 170\\text{–}180\\,\\text{MeV}$ per event.\n- **Fusion:** Very light nuclei (e.g., deuterium, tritium, with $\\bar{b} \\approx 1\\text{–}3\\,\\text{MeV/nucleon}$) are on the far left of the peak. By fusing to form a heavier nucleus like helium ($\\bar{b} \\approx 7.1\\,\\text{MeV/nucleon}$), they also climb the curve, releasing a large amount of energy per nucleon, often greater than in fission.\n\nIn summary, both processes are exothermic because the products are more tightly bound than the reactants.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.462}$$", "id": "3700502"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of binding energy, we now examine the subtle quantum effects that govern reaction feasibility.

The threshold condition for fission of a compound nucleus is that the excitation energy of the compound nucleus exceeds the fission barrier, i.e., the incident neutron kinetic energy $E_n$ plus the reaction $Q$-value must satisfy $E_n + Q \\ge B_f$, where $B_f$ is the height of the fission barrier of the compound nucleus. For fusion, the $Q$-value is defined as the change in total binding energy between products and reactants.\n\nAnalyze the following scenarios, focusing exclusively on the pairing term’s contribution to binding energies:\n- Neutron capture and subsequent fission on an odd-$A$ target: $n + {}^{235}\\mathrm{U} \\rightarrow {}^{236}\\mathrm{U}^* \\rightarrow \\text{fission}$.\n- Neutron capture and subsequent fission on an even-even target: $n + {}^{238}\\mathrm{U} \\rightarrow {}^{239}\\mathrm{U}^* \\rightarrow \\text{fission}$.\n- Fusion of two even-even light nuclei: ${}^{12}\\mathrm{C} + {}^{12}\\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow {}^{24}\\mathrm{Mg}^*$.\n\nAssume the fission barrier is comparable for ${}^{236}\\mathrm{U}$ and ${}^{239}\\mathrm{U}$, and that all other SEMF terms (volume, surface, asymmetry, Coulomb) are similar enough between the compared cases that differences in thresholds are governed by the pairing term.

The compound nucleus ${}^{236}\\mathrm{U}$ is an even-even nucleus (even Z, even N), so its pairing term is positive: $\\delta({}^{236}\\mathrm{U}) = +a_p A^{-1/2}$.

The product ${}^{24}\\mathrm{Mg}$ is also an even-even nucleus, with pairing term $\\delta({}^{24}\\mathrm{Mg}) = +a_p (24)^{-1/2}$.

We use the given mass $m_{\\text{fis}} = 1.000 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{kg}$, molar mass $M_{^{235}\\text{U}} = 235\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = 0.235\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$, and Avogadro's constant $N_{A} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n$$N_{^{235}\\text{U}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{fis}}}{M_{^{235}\\text{U}}} \\times N_{A}$$\n$$N_{^{235}\\text{U}} = \\frac{1.000 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{kg}}{0.235\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}} \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\approx 2.5626 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\text{atoms}$$\n\nNext, we determine the rate of fission reactions, $R_{\\text{fis}}$, required to produce the thermal power $P_{\\text{th}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{fis}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{th}}}{Q_{\\text{fis}}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{J/s}}{3.20435 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{J}} \\approx 3.1208 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nEach fission event consumes one $^{235}\\text{U}$ atom.\n\nThe number of fissile atoms consumed during one year, $N_{\\text{consumed,fission}}$, is this rate multiplied by $T_{\\text{yr}} = 3.1536 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{s}$.\n$$N_{\\text{consumed,fission}} = R_{\\text{fis}} \\times T_{\\text{yr}} = (3.1208 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (3.1536 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{s}) \\approx 9.8415 \\times 10^{26}\\,\\text{atoms}$$\n\nThe fission burn fraction is the ratio of atoms consumed to the total atoms present initially.\n$$f_{\\text{burn,fission}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{consumed,fission}}}{N_{^{235}\\text{U}}} = \\frac{9.8415 \\times 10^{26}}{2.5626 \\times 10^{28}} \\approx 0.038403$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the fission burn fraction is $0.0384$.\n\n**Interpretation of Consequences**\n\nThe calculated burn fractions, while numerically similar (both are a few percent), represent vastly different physical realities and engineering challenges.\n\nFor **fusion**, the burn fraction of approximately $2.7\\%$ occurs over the very short particle confinement time of $\\tau_p = 3.00\\,\\text{s}$. This signifies that only a small fraction of the fuel fuses per \"pass\" through the reactor. A fuel ion is far more likely to be lost from the plasma than to undergo fusion. This has a critical consequence for confinement: to achieve a self-sustaining reaction, the energy and particle confinement must be exquisitely good (maximizing $\\tau_p$) to increase the probability of fusion. It also dictates that a fusion power plant must operate like a continuous-flow chemical plant, where the vast majority of the fuel ($97\\%$) that is exhausted from the plasma chamber must be efficiently collected, separated from the helium \"ash,\" and reinjected into the plasma. The total fuel inventory in the machine at any one time is very small compared to the amount processed over time.\n\nFor **fission**, the burn fraction of approximately $3.8\\%$ occurs over one year. The fuel is a static, solid inventory that resides in the reactor core. This relatively low annual burnup is characteristic of Light Water Reactors and allows for long operational cycles (typically $12$ to $24$ months) before refueling is necessary. The \"fuel availability\" in the core decreases as fissile material is consumed and fission products (which act as neutron poisons) accumulate. Unlike fusion, there is no \"confinement time\" for fuel atoms; the challenge is not preventing fuel from escaping but managing the nuclear chain reaction over long periods and dealing with the resulting high-level radioactive waste. The fuel inventory is massive and is consumed in a batch process over years.\n\nIn summary, the fusion system is a low-inventory, high-throughput, low-efficiency-per-pass system reliant on excellent confinement and fuel recycling. The fission system is a massive-inventory, batch-process system with much higher fuel burnup over its long operating cycle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0266  0.0384 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3700508"}]}
