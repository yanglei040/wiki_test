There are no ambiguous or undefined terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Critical Pitch Angle**\n\nThe motion of the charged particle is governed by the conservation of two quantities: its total kinetic energy, $E$, and its magnetic moment, $\\mu$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\parallel}^2 + v_{\\perp}^2)$$\nwhere $v_{\\parallel}$ and $v_{\\perp}$ are the components of the particle's velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field line, respectively. Since $E$ is conserved and the mass $m$ is constant, the particle's total speed $v = \\sqrt{v_{\\parallel}^2 + v_{\\perp}^2}$ is also constant.\n\nThe first adiabatic invariant, or magnetic moment, is given by:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{mv_{\\perp}^2}{2B}$$\nwhere $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field. Conservation of $\\mu$ implies that as the particle moves into a region of stronger magnetic field, its perpendicular kinetic energy increases.\n\nLet's denote the quantities at the midplane ($z=0$) with a subscript $0$. At the midplane, the magnetic field is at its minimum, $B(0) = B_0$. The velocity components are related to the total speed $v$ and the pitch angle $\\alpha$ by:\n$$v_{\\perp 0} = v \\sin(\\alpha)$$\n$$v_{\\parallel 0} = v \\cos(\\alpha)$$\n\nFrom the conservation of $\\mu$, we can relate the perpendicular velocity at any point $z$ to its value at the midplane:\n$$\\frac{mv_{\\perp}(z)^2}{2B(z)} = \\frac{mv_{\\perp 0}^2}{2B_0}$$\n$$v_{\\perp}(z)^2 = v_{\\perp 0}^2 \\frac{B(z)}{B_0} = v^2 \\sin^2(\\alpha) \\frac{B(z)}{B_0}$$\n\nUsing the conservation of total energy (and thus total speed $v$), we can find the parallel velocity at point $z$:\n$$v_{\\parallel}(z)^2 = v^2 - v_{\\perp}(z)^2 = v^2 - v^2 \\sin^2(\\alpha) \\frac{B(z)}{B_0}$$\n$$v_{\\parallel}(z)^2 = v^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{B(z)}{B_0} \\sin^2(\\alpha)\\right)$$\n\nA particle is \"mirrored\" or reflected at a turning point $z_{turn}$ where its parallel motion reverses. At this point, $v_{\\parallel}(z_{turn}) = 0$. This gives the mirroring condition:\n$$0 = v^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{B(z_{turn})}{B_0} \\sin^2(\\alpha)\\right)$$\n$$1 = \\frac{B(z_{turn})}{B_0} \\sin^2(\\alpha)$$\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{B_0}{B(z_{turn})}$$\n\nA particle is trapped within the mirror if it reflects before escaping from the high-field region at the \"throat\" of the mirror, where the magnetic field is maximum, $B_{\\max}$. This means a turning point must exist where $B(z_{turn}) \\leq B_{\\max}$.\nSubstituting the mirroring condition into this inequality:\n$$\\frac{B_0}{\\sin^2(\\alpha)} \\leq B_{\\max}$$\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha) \\geq \\frac{B_0}{B_{\\max}}$$\nUsing the definition of the mirror ratio, $R_m = B_{\\max}/B_0$, the condition for a particle to be trapped is:\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha) \\geq \\frac{1}{R_m}$$\nParticles that do not satisfy this condition will escape, and their pitch angles define the \"loss cone\". The critical pitch angle, $\\alpha_c$, is the boundary of this loss cone. It corresponds to the minimum pitch angle a particle at the midplane can have and still be trapped. Therefore, it is defined by the equality:\n$$\\sin^2(\\alpha_c) = \\frac{1}{R_m}$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is an angle, $\\alpha_c$ must be in the range $[0, \\pi/2]$. Taking the square root gives:\n$$\\sin(\\alpha_c) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R_m}}$$\n$$\\alpha_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R_m}}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Value of the Critical Pitch Angle**\n\nGiven the mirror ratio $R_m = 3$, we can compute the numerical value of $\\alpha_c$.\n$$\\alpha_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\nFirst, we calculate the argument:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.577350269...$$\nNow, we find the arcsin of this value in radians:\n$$\\alpha_c \\approx \\arcsin(0.577350269...) \\approx 0.6154797... \\text{ rad}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the critical pitch angle is:\n$$\\alpha_c \\approx 0.6155 \\text{ rad}$$\n\n**Part 3: Fraction of Trapped Particles**\n\nThe problem states that the plasma at the midplane is a stationary isotropic Maxwellian. The term \"isotropic\" means the velocity distribution function is independent of direction; it depends only on the magnitude of the velocity, $v$. Consequently, the fraction of particles within a certain range of pitch angles is determined solely by the solid angle corresponding to that range, divided by the total solid angle of $4\\pi$ steradians.\n\nThe pitch angle $\\alpha$ is the polar angle in a spherical coordinate system for velocity space. The differential solid angle is $d\\Omega = \\sin(\\alpha) \\, d\\alpha \\, d\\phi$.\n\nParticles are trapped if their pitch angle $\\alpha$ at the midplane satisfies $\\sin^2(\\alpha) \\geq 1/R_m$. This is equivalent to $\\alpha_c \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\pi - \\alpha_c$.\n\nThe solid angle of the trapped region, $\\Omega_{trapped}$, is found by integrating over the range of trapped angles:\n$$\\Omega_{trapped} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi - \\alpha_c} \\sin(\\alpha) \\, d\\alpha$$\nThe integral over $\\phi$ gives $2\\pi$. The integral over $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi - \\alpha_c} \\sin(\\alpha) \\, d\\alpha = [-\\cos(\\alpha)]_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi - \\alpha_c} = -\\cos(\\pi - \\alpha_c) - (-\\cos(\\alpha_c))$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos(\\pi - x) = -\\cos(x)$, this becomes:\n$$-(-\\cos(\\alpha_c)) + \\cos(\\alpha_c) = 2\\cos(\\alpha_c)$$\nSo, the solid angle for trapped particles is:\n$$\\Omega_{trapped} = 2\\pi \\times 2\\cos(\\alpha_c) = 4\\pi\\cos(\\alpha_c)$$\nThe fraction of trapped particles, $F_{trapped}$, is the ratio of the trapped solid angle to the total solid angle ($4\\pi$):\n$$F_{trapped} = \\frac{\\Omega_{trapped}}{\\Omega_{total}} = \\frac{4\\pi\\cos(\\alpha_c)}{4\\pi} = \\cos(\\alpha_c)$$\n\nTo find a numerical value, we first express $\\cos(\\alpha_c)$ in terms of $R_m$. Using the identity $\\cos^2(\\alpha_c) + \\sin^2(\\alpha_c) = 1$ and the result from Part 1, $\\sin^2(\\alpha_c) = 1/R_m$:\n$$\\cos^2(\\alpha_c) = 1 - \\sin^2(\\alpha_c) = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_m}$$\nSince $\\alpha_c$ is in the first quadrant, $\\cos(\\alpha_c)$ is positive.\n$$\\cos(\\alpha_c) = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{R_m}}$$\nSo, the fraction of trapped particles is:\n$$F_{trapped} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{R_m}}$$\nFor $R_m = 3$:\n$$F_{trapped} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$F_{trapped} \\approx \\sqrt{0.666666...} \\approx 0.81649658...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fraction of trapped particles is:\n$$F_{trapped} \\approx 0.8165$$\n\nThe final answers for Part 2 and Part 3 are the numerical values for $\\alpha_c$ and $F_{trapped}$, respectively.\n$\\alpha_c \\approx 0.6155$ radians.\n$F_{trapped} \\approx 0.8165$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6155 & 0.8165 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3708191"}, {"introduction": "Having established the conditions for trapping, we now turn to the dynamics of a confined particle.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and the given numerical values are physically plausible for a magnetic confinement scenario. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation based on two fundamental principles: conservation of energy and the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total kinetic energy $E$ of the ion is constant, as the Lorentz force does no work. It is the sum of the kinetic energy parallel ($E_\\parallel$) and perpendicular ($E_\\perp$) to the magnetic field lines:\n    $$E = E_\\parallel + E_\\perp = \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\perp^2 = \\text{constant}$$\n    Here, $v_\\parallel$ and $v_\\perp$ are the components of the ion's velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, respectively. Note that $v_\\parallel = \\frac{ds}{dt}$.\n\n2.  **Adiabatic Invariance of the Magnetic Moment**: For motion in a magnetic field that changes slowly in space and time compared to the fast gyromotion, the magnetic moment $\\mu$ is an adiabatic invariant:\n    $$\\mu = \\frac{E_\\perp}{B} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv_\\perp^2}{B(s)} = \\text{constant}$$\n    This assumption's validity will be checked at the end.\n\nFrom the invariance of $\\mu$, we can express the perpendicular kinetic energy as $E_\\perp(s) = \\mu B(s)$. Substituting this into the energy conservation equation gives:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 + \\mu B(s)$$\nThis equation describes the dynamics of the guiding center along the magnetic field line. We can rearrange it to find the parallel kinetic energy:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_\\parallel^2 = E - \\mu B(s)$$\nThe term $V_{eff}(s) = \\mu B(s)$ acts as an effective potential energy for the parallel motion. The force on the guiding center along the field line, known as the mirror force, is the negative gradient of this potential:\n$$F_\\parallel = -\\frac{d}{ds}V_{eff}(s) = -\\mu \\frac{dB}{ds}$$\nThe equation of motion for the parallel component is therefore:\n$$m\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -\\mu \\frac{dB}{ds}$$\n\nTo determine the constant $\\mu$, we use the initial conditions. The problem states that the ion has a pitch angle of $90^\\circ$ at the magnetic minimum ($s=0$). A pitch angle of $90^\\circ$ means the velocity vector is entirely perpendicular to the magnetic field. Thus, at $s=0$, $v_\\parallel(0) = 0$. Consequently, the parallel kinetic energy $E_\\parallel(0) = 0$. From the conservation of energy, the total energy is equal to the perpendicular energy at this point: $E=E_\\perp(0)$.\nThe magnetic field at this point is $B(0) = B_0$. We can now fix the value of the magnetic moment:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{E_\\perp(0)}{B(0)} = \\frac{E}{B_0}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mu$ and the given form of $B(s)$ into the equation of motion:\n$$B(s) = B_0\\left(1+\\beta s^2\\right) \\implies \\frac{dB}{ds} = B_0(2\\beta s) = 2\\beta B_0 s$$\n$$m\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -\\left(\\frac{E}{B_0}\\right)(2\\beta B_0 s) = -2\\beta E s$$\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n$$\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \\left(\\frac{2\\beta E}{m}\\right)s = 0$$\nThis is the canonical form of the equation for simple harmonic motion, $\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \\omega_b^2 s = 0$. This demonstrates that for small-amplitude oscillations around $s=0$, the ion's bounce motion is approximately harmonic.\n\nBy comparing the two equations, we identify the square of the bounce angular frequency $\\omega_b$:\n$$\\omega_b^2 = \\frac{2\\beta E}{m}$$\nThus, the bounce angular frequency is:\n$$\\omega_b = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\beta E}{m}}$$\nThe bounce period $\\tau_b$ is related to the angular frequency by $\\tau_b = 2\\pi/\\omega_b$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\tau_b$.

This requires that the gyromotion be much faster than the bounce motion, i.e., $\\omega_c \\gg \\omega_b$, where $\\omega_c$ is the ion cyclotron (gyro) angular frequency. We calculate $\\omega_c$ at the minimum magnetic field $B_0=2\\,\\text{T}$:\n$$\\omega_c = \\frac{|q|B_0}{m} = \\frac{e B_0}{m}$$\n$$\\omega_c = \\frac{(1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}) \\times (2\\,\\text{T})}{3.345\\,243\\,847\\,38 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}} \\approx 9.578\\,84 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{rad/s}$$\nWe now evaluate the ratio of the frequencies:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_b}{\\omega_c} = \\frac{3.094\\,97 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{rad/s}}{9.578\\,84 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{rad/s}} \\approx 0.00323$$\nSince $\\omega_b/\\omega_c \\approx 3.23 \\times 10^{-3} \\ll 1$, the bounce frequency is indeed much smaller than the gyrofrequency. This confirms that the two time scales are well separated, and the use of the adiabatic invariant $\\mu$ is justified.\nThe initial pitch angle at $s=0$ is given as $\\alpha_0 = 90^\\circ$.\nThe final calculated bounce period is the required answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20.3}$$", "id": "3708225"}, {"introduction": "The conservation of adiabatic invariants is a powerful tool, but its breakdown is a critical source of particle transport.

The concepts of adiabatic invariants (`$\\mu$`, `$J_{\\parallel}$`), guiding-center motion, E$\\times$B drift, and magnetic mirrors are fundamental to the field. The parabolic approximation of the magnetic field near its minimum is a standard technique. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear set of tasks, definitions, and all necessary parameters for the final calculation. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any physical laws, is not based on false premises, and is a formalizable scientific problem. The given parameters are physically realistic for a fusion-relevant plasma experiment. The mass of the deuteron is a known physical constant, and its omission is standard practice in physics problems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the deuteron, `$K$`, is conserved in the absence of the electric field and for a static magnetic field. In the guiding-center approximation, we can write the energy as the sum of parallel and perpendicular kinetic energies:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\perp}^2$$\nThe first adiabatic invariant, the magnetic moment `$\\mu$`, is given as conserved:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\perp}^2}{B(s)}$$\nFrom the conservation of `$\\mu$`, we can express the perpendicular kinetic energy as `$\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\perp}^2 = \\mu B(s)$`. Substituting this into the energy conservation equation gives:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\parallel}^2 + \\mu B(s)$$\nThis equation describes the exchange between parallel kinetic energy and the potential energy `$\\mu B(s)$` associated with the particle's magnetic moment in the spatially varying magnetic field. We can solve for the parallel velocity `$v_{\\parallel}$`:\n$$v_{\\parallel} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(K - \\mu B(s))}$$\nThe motion is confined to a region where `$K \\ge \\mu B(s)$`. The turning points of the motion occur where `$v_{\\parallel} = 0$`, i.e., `$K = \\mu B(s_{\\text{turn}})$`.\n\n**1. Bounce Motion and Bounce Frequency `$\\omega_b$`**\n\nWe are given the magnetic field near the minimum `$s=0$` as `$B(s) = B_{0} + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha s^2$`. Substituting this into the equation for parallel motion:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\parallel}^2 = K - \\mu \\left( B_{0} + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha s^2 \\right)$$\nThe parallel motion is governed by the effective potential `$U_{\\parallel}(s) = \\mu B(s) = \\mu B_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\alpha s^2$`. The equation for the acceleration along the field line is obtained by taking the time derivative of the energy equation, or more directly from the parallel component of the Lorentz force for the guiding center, `$F_{\\parallel} = -\\mu \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial s}$`:\n$$m \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -\\mu \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\left( B_{0} + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha s^2 \\right) = -\\mu (\\alpha s)$$\n$$m \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -(\\mu\\alpha) s$$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, `$\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = -\\omega_b^2 s$`. By comparison, we identify the square of the bounce angular frequency:\n$$\\omega_b^2 = \\frac{\\mu\\alpha}{m}$$\nThus, the bounce angular frequency is:\n$$\\omega_b = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu\\alpha}{m}}$$\n\n**2. Bounce Frequency in terms of `$v_{\\perp}$`, `$B_0$`, and `$\\alpha$`**\n\nThe problem specifies `$v_{\\perp}$` as the perpendicular speed at `$s=0$`. At this point, `$B(s=0) = B_0$`. We can express the magnetic moment `$\\mu$` in terms of these parameters:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\perp}^2}{B_0} = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2B_0}$$\nSubstituting this expression for `$\\mu$` into the formula for `$\\omega_b$`:\n$$\\omega_b = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2B_0} \\right) \\alpha} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha v_{\\perp}^2}{2B_0}}$$\n\n**3. E$\\times$B Rotation Frequency `$\\omega_E$`**\n\nA uniform transverse electric field `$E_{\\perp}$` and a dominant axial magnetic field `$B_0 \\hat{z}$` produce an E$\\times$B drift velocity `$\\vec{v}_E$`:\n$$\\vec{v}_E = \\frac{\\vec{E} \\times \\vec{B}}{B^2}$$\nApproximating `$B \\approx B_0$` in the central cell for the drift calculation, the magnitude of the drift velocity is:\n$$v_E = \\frac{E_{\\perp} B_0}{B_0^2} = \\frac{E_{\\perp}}{B_0}$$\nThis drift is azimuthal. The problem states this drift rotates the guiding center in a cylindrical cell of radius `$R$`. The angular frequency of this rotation, `$\\omega_E$`, is `$v_E/r$`, where `$r$` is the radial position of the guiding center. The problem asks for `$\\omega_E$` in terms of `$R$`, implying that `$R$` is the characteristic radius for this rotation. We therefore evaluate the angular frequency at `$r=R$`:\n$$\\omega_E = \\frac{v_E}{R} = \\frac{E_{\\perp}}{R B_0}$$\n\n**4. Adiabaticity Parameter, Perturbation Scaling, and Breakdown Criterion**\n\nThe adiabaticity parameter `$\\epsilon$` is the ratio of the slow frequency (`$\\omega_E$`) to the fast frequency (`$\\omega_b$`):\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{\\omega_E}{\\omega_b}$$\nThe second adiabatic invariant `$J_{\\parallel}$` is associated with the periodic bounce motion. The azimuthal drift due to the `$E_{\\perp}$` field acts as a slow perturbation to the bounce motion, with frequency `$\\omega_E$`. According to the theory of adiabatic invariants in Hamiltonian systems, for a slow perturbation (`$\\epsilon \\ll 1$`), the change in the action variable per cycle of the fast motion is exponentially small. Thus, the leading-order fractional perturbation `$\\Delta J_{\\parallel}/J_{\\parallel}$` per bounce scales as:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta J_{\\parallel}}{J_{\\parallel}} \\sim \\exp\\left(-\\frac{C}{\\epsilon}\\right)$$\nwhere `$C$` is a constant of order unity that depends on the analytic structure of the perturbation.\n\nThe conservation of `$J_{\\parallel}$` is robust when `$\\epsilon \\ll 1$`. The adiabatic approximation breaks down when the slow and fast frequencies become comparable. This can lead to resonance, stochastic motion, and rapid transport. The criterion for the breakdown of `$J_{\\parallel}$` conservation is therefore:\n$$\\epsilon \\gtrsim 1$$\n\n**5. Calculation of the Critical Electric Field `$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$`**\n\nThe problem defines the critical condition for breakdown as `$\\epsilon = 1$`. We need to find the electric field, `$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$`, that satisfies this condition.\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{\\omega_E}{\\omega_b} = \\frac{E_{\\perp}/(R B_0)}{\\sqrt{\\alpha v_{\\perp}^2/(2B_0)}} = 1$$\nSolving for `$E_{\\perp} = E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$`:\n$$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = R B_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha v_{\\perp}^2}{2B_0}} = R v_{\\perp} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha B_0}{2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   `$B_{0} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$`\n-   `$\\alpha = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{T/m^{2}}$`\n-   `$v_{\\perp} = 7.5\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$`\n-   `$R = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}$`\n\n$$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = (0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}) (7.5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.2\\,\\mathrm{T/m^2})(1.5\\,\\mathrm{T})}{2}}$$\n$$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = (7.5 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\sqrt{0.15\\,\\mathrm{T^2/m^2}}$$\n$$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = (7.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\sqrt{0.15}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$$\nHere, the units are consistent since `$\\mathrm{[T \\cdot m/s]} = \\mathrm{[V/m]}$`.\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{0.15} \\approx 0.38729833$$\n$$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx (7.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\times 0.38729833\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$$\n$$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 29047.375\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$E_{\\perp}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = 2.905 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{V/m}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.905 \\times 10^4}\n$$", "id": "3708176"}]}
