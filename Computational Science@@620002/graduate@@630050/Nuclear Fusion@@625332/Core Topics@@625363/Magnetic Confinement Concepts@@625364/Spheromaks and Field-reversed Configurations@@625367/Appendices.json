The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Detailed Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Safety Factor $q(r)$**\n\nThe magnetic field lines are defined by the differential equation $d\\mathbf{l} \\propto \\mathbf{B}$, where $d\\mathbf{l}$ is the vector element of arc length along a field line. In cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{B_r} = \\frac{r d\\theta}{B_\\theta} = \\frac{dz}{B_z}\n$$\nGiven the problem statement that $B_r(r)=0$, the field lines are constrained to lie on cylindrical surfaces of constant radius $r$. For these surfaces, the field line trajectory is governed by:\n$$\n\\frac{r d\\theta}{B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{dz}{B_z(r)}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to give the pitch of the helical field lines:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} = \\frac{B_\\theta(r)}{r B_z(r)}\n$$\nThe safety factor, $q(r)$, is defined as the number of transits a field line makes in the toroidal direction (along $z$) for every single transit in the poloidal direction (along $\\theta$). We can find the distance $\\Delta z$ traversed along $z$ for one full poloidal rotation ($\\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi$) by integrating:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{dz}{d\\theta} d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r B_z(r)}{B_\\theta(r)} d\\theta\n$$\nSince $B_\\theta$ and $B_z$ depend only on $r$, the integrand is constant with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\frac{r B_z(r)}{B_\\theta(r)} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi \\frac{r B_z(r)}{B_\\theta(r)}\n$$\nThis $\\Delta z$ is the pitch length of the helical field line. The safety factor $q(r)$ is this pitch length normalized by the system's periodicity length $L$:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{\\Delta z}{L} = \\frac{2\\pi r B_z(r)}{L B_\\theta(r)}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: General Form of the Magnetic Field Components**\n\nThe plasma is in a Taylor-relaxed state, satisfying the force-free equation $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\lambda \\mathbf{B}$ with uniform $\\lambda$. In cylindrical coordinates, for a field $\\mathbf{B}(r) = B_{\\theta}(r)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{\\theta} + B_{z}(r)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z}$, the curl is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{dB_z}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d(r B_\\theta)}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z\n$$\nSubstituting this into the force-free equation gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{dB_z}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d(r B_\\theta)}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z = \\lambda B_\\theta(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta + \\lambda B_z(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z\n$$\nEquating the components yields a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations:\n1.  $\\frac{dB_z}{dr} = -\\lambda B_\\theta$\n2.  $\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d(r B_\\theta)}{dr} = \\lambda B_z$\n\nTo solve this system, we can differentiate equation (1) with respect to $r$ and substitute $d(r B_\\theta)/dr$ from equation (2), but it is more direct to obtain a single equation for one component. Let us find an equation for $B_z$. From (1), we have $B_\\theta = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\frac{dB_z}{dr}$. Substituting this into (2):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\frac{dB_z}{dr}\\right)\\right) = \\lambda B_z\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\lambda r} \\left( \\frac{dB_z}{dr} + r \\frac{d^2B_z}{dr^2} \\right) = \\lambda B_z\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2B_z}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dB_z}{dr} + \\lambda^2 B_z = 0\n$$\nThis is Bessel's differential equation of order $0$. The general solution is $B_z(r) = C_1 J_0(\\lambda r) + C_2 Y_0(\\lambda r)$, where $J_0$ and $Y_0$ are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively, of order $0$.\nThe problem requires a solution that is regular at the axis $r=0$. The function $Y_0(\\lambda r)$ diverges as $r \\to 0$. Therefore, physical regularity demands that $C_2=0$. The solution for $B_z$ is thus:\n$$\nB_z(r) = B_0 J_0(\\lambda r)\n$$\nwhere $B_0$ is an arbitrary constant amplitude.\nNow we find $B_\\theta(r)$ using equation (1):\n$$\nB_\\theta(r) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\frac{d}{dr} [B_0 J_0(\\lambda r)] = -\\frac{B_0}{\\lambda} [J_0'(\\lambda r) \\cdot \\lambda] = -B_0 J_0'(\\lambda r)\n$$\nUsing the Bessel function identity $J_0'(x) = -J_1(x)$, we get:\n$$\nB_\\theta(r) = -B_0 [-J_1(\\lambda r)] = B_0 J_1(\\lambda r)\n$$\nThus, the magnetic field components for the lowest-energy Taylor-relaxed state are given by the Bessel Function Model (BFM):\n$$\nB_z(r) = B_0 J_0(\\lambda r) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B_\\theta(r) = B_0 J_1(\\lambda r)\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Explicit Expression for $q(r)$**\n\nWe combine the results from Part 1 and Part 2 by substituting the expressions for $B_\\theta(r)$ and $B_z(r)$ into the formula for $q(r)$:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{2\\pi r}{L} \\frac{B_z(r)}{B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{2\\pi r}{L} \\frac{B_0 J_0(\\lambda r)}{B_0 J_1(\\lambda r)}\n$$\nThe amplitude $B_0$ cancels, yielding the explicit expression for the safety factor profile:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{2\\pi r}{L} \\frac{J_0(\\lambda r)}{J_1(\\lambda r)}\n$$\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Evaluation and Stability Assessment**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the edge safety factor, $q_{\\mathrm{edge}} = q(a)$, for the given parameters:\n$a = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $L = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\lambda = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\nFirst, calculate the argument of the Bessel functions, $\\lambda a$:\n$$\n\\lambda a = (6.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1})(0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 1.5\n$$\nThe expression for $q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$ is:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{edge}} = q(a) = \\frac{2\\pi a}{L} \\frac{J_0(\\lambda a)}{J_1(\\lambda a)} = \\frac{2\\pi(0.25)}{1.2} \\frac{J_0(1.5)}{J_1(1.5)}\n$$\nUsing standard mathematical libraries for the values of the Bessel functions:\n$$\nJ_0(1.5) \\approx 0.51182765\n$$\n$$\nJ_1(1.5) \\approx 0.55793651\n$$\nNow, we compute the value of $q_{\\mathrm{edge}}$:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{edge}} = \\frac{0.5\\pi}{1.2} \\frac{0.51182765}{0.55793651} \\approx \\left(1.3089969\\right) \\times \\left(0.9173595\\right) \\approx 1.2007851\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{edge}} \\approx 1.201\n$$\nThe Kruskal-Shafranov stability criterion for the ideal external kink mode requires $q_{\\mathrm{edge}} > 1$. Since our calculated value is $q_{\\mathrm{edge}} \\approx 1.201$, we have $1.201 > 1$.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Safety Factor Profile\n\nThe safety factor $q(\\psi)$ is a measure of the winding of a magnetic field line on a magnetic flux surface. The provided definition is interpreted, for dimensional consistency, as an integral over the poloidal angle $\\theta$:\n$$\nq(\\psi) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{\\psi=\\text{const}} \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\nabla \\phi}{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\nabla \\theta}\\,d\\theta\n$$\nWe work in a local coordinate system $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ centered on the magnetic axis at major radius $R_0$, where $r$ is the minor radial distance and $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle. The major radius coordinate is $R = R_0 + r\\cos\\theta$.\n\nFirst, we determine the function $g(\\psi)$ from the force-free condition, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\lambda \\mathbf{B}$. Using the axisymmetric representation for $\\mathbf{B}$, the curl is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{dg}{d\\psi} \\mathbf{B}_p - \\frac{\\Delta^*\\psi}{R^2}\\hat{\\phi}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}_p = \\frac{1}{R}\\nabla\\psi \\times \\hat{\\phi}$ is the poloidal field and $\\Delta^*\\psi = R \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}(\\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial R}) + \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial Z^2}$ is the Grad-Shafranov operator.\nEquating the poloidal components of $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$ with $\\lambda\\mathbf{B}_p$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{d\\psi}\\mathbf{B}_p = \\lambda\\mathbf{B}_p \\implies \\frac{dg}{d\\psi} = \\lambda\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $\\psi$ gives $g(\\psi) = \\lambda\\psi + C$. The toroidal component of the force-free condition provides the Grad-Shafranov equation for this system: $\\Delta^*\\psi = -g(\\psi)\\frac{dg}{d\\psi} = -\\lambda g(\\psi)$. Near the magnetic axis ($r=0$, $\\psi=\\psi_0$), we can approximate $\\Delta^* \\psi \\approx \\nabla_p^2 \\psi$ and $g(\\psi)\\approx g(\\psi_0)$. Using the given form of $\\psi(r)$, we find $\\nabla_p^2 \\psi = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r\\frac{d\\psi}{dr}) = -\\psi_0\\lambda^2$.

The solution process proceeds as follows.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the open orbit fraction $F_{\\text{open}}$**\n\nThe fraction of ions at radius $r_{0}$ whose orbits are open, $F_{\\text{open}}$, is defined as the fraction of the ion population with a Larmor radius $\\rho_{i}$ greater than the distance to the separatrix, $\\Delta$. The condition is given as $\\rho_{i} > \\Delta$.\n\nUsing the definitions provided for the Larmor radius, $\\rho_{i} = v_{\\perp}/\\Omega_{i}$, and the ion gyrofrequency, $\\Omega_{i} = q B_{0}/m_{i}$, this condition can be expressed in terms of the ion's perpendicular speed, $v_{\\perp}$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{\\Omega_{i}} > \\Delta \\implies v_{\\perp} > \\Omega_{i} \\Delta\n$$\nWe must therefore calculate the fraction of ions in the given velocity distribution that satisfy $v_{\\perp} > \\Omega_{i} \\Delta$.\n\nThe ion velocity distribution function is given as:\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{v}) = n_{0} \\left( \\frac{m_{i}}{2 \\pi k_{B} T_{i}} \\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\left( v_{\\parallel}^{2} + v_{\\perp}^{2} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe fraction $F_{\\text{open}}$ is the integral of the normalized distribution function, $f(\\mathbf{v})/n_{0}$, over the region of velocity space where the condition is met. We can express the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ in cylindrical coordinates $(v_{\\perp}, \\phi_{v}, v_{\\parallel})$, where $v_{\\perp}$ is the speed perpendicular to the magnetic field, $v_{\\parallel}$ is the speed parallel to the field, and $\\phi_{v}$ is the gyrophase angle. The volume element in velocity space is $d^{3}v = v_{\\perp} dv_{\\perp} d\\phi_{v} dv_{\\parallel}$.\n\nThe fraction $F_{\\text{open}}$ is given by:\n$$\nF_{\\text{open}} = \\frac{1}{n_{0}} \\int_{\\text{loss region}} f(\\mathbf{v}) \\, d^{3}v\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\text{open}} = \\left( \\frac{m_{i}}{2 \\pi k_{B} T_{i}} \\right)^{3/2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i} v_{\\parallel}^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\right) dv_{\\parallel} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi_{v} \\int_{\\Omega_{i} \\Delta}^{\\infty} v_{\\perp} \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i} v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\right) dv_{\\perp}\n$$\n\nThe integral over $v_{\\parallel}$ is a standard Gaussian integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i} v_{\\parallel}^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\right) dv_{\\parallel} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{i}}}\n$$\nThe integral over the angle $\\phi_{v}$ is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi_{v} = 2\\pi\n$$\nThe integral over $v_{\\perp}$ can be solved by a change of variables.

The lower limit of integration for $v_{\\perp}$ is $\\Omega_{i} \\Delta$, so the lower limit for $u$ is $\\frac{m_{i}(\\Omega_{i}\\Delta)^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}}$.\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_{i} \\Delta}^{\\infty} v_{\\perp} \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i} v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\right) dv_{\\perp} = \\frac{k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{i}} \\int_{\\frac{m_{i}(\\Omega_{i}\\Delta)^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}}}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, du\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{i}} \\left[ -\\exp(-u) \\right]_{\\frac{m_{i}(\\Omega_{i}\\Delta)^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}}}^{\\infty} = \\frac{k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{i}} \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i}(\\Omega_{i}\\Delta)^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\right)\n$$\n\nCombining all the parts:\n$$\nF_{\\text{open}} = \\left( \\frac{m_{i}}{2 \\pi k_{B} T_{i}} \\right)^{3/2} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{i}}} \\right) (2\\pi) \\left( \\frac{k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{i}} \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i}(\\Omega_{i}\\Delta)^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe normalization prefactors cancel out:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{m_{i}}{2 \\pi k_{B} T_{i}} \\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{i}}} (2\\pi)^{1} \\frac{k_{B} T_{i}}{m_{i}} = \\frac{m_{i}^{3/2}}{(2\\pi)^{3/2}(k_{B}T_{i})^{3/2}} \\frac{(2\\pi)^{1/2}(k_{B}T_{i})^{1/2}}{m_{i}^{1/2}} (2\\pi)^{1} \\frac{k_{B}T_{i}}{m_{i}} = 1\n$$\nThus, the fraction of ions on open orbits is:\n$$\nF_{\\text{open}} = \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i}(\\Omega_{i}\\Delta)^{2}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Omega_{i} = q B_{0} / m_{i}$:\n$$\nF_{\\text{open}} = \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{m_{i}}{2 k_{B} T_{i}} \\left( \\frac{q B_{0} \\Delta}{m_{i}} \\right)^{2} \\right) = \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2} \\Delta^{2}}{2 m_{i} k_{B} T_{i}} \\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the loss rate coefficient $\\nu_{\\text{loss}}$**\n\nThe problem defines a loss model where any ion on an open orbit ($\\rho_{i} > \\Delta$) is lost within one ion gyroperiod.

This implies that the characteristic time scale for the loss of this sub-population is the ion gyroperiod, $T_{\\text{gyro}} = 2\\pi / \\Omega_{i}$. The frequency of gyration is $f_{\\text{gyro}} = 1/T_{\\text{gyro}} = \\Omega_{i} / (2\\pi)$.\n\nWe model the rate of change of density as the density of particles in the loss region divided by the characteristic loss time:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = - \\frac{n_{\\text{loss}}}{T_{\\text{gyro}}} = - \\frac{n F_{\\text{open}}}{2\\pi/\\Omega_{i}} = -n \\left( \\frac{\\Omega_{i} F_{\\text{open}}}{2\\pi} \\right)\n$$\nBy comparing this with the defining relation $\\mathrm{d}n/\\mathrm{d}t = - \\nu_{\\text{loss}} n$, we identify the loss rate coefficient:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{loss}} = \\frac{\\Omega_{i} F_{\\text{open}}}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThis expression has units of frequency ($s^{-1}$), as required for a rate coefficient.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Omega_{i}$ and $F_{\\text{open}}$:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{loss}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{q B_{0}}{m_{i}} \\right) \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2} \\Delta^{2}}{2 m_{i} k_{B} T_{i}} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe final expressions for $F_{\\text{open}}$ and $\\nu_{\\text{loss}}$ are:\n$$\nF_{\\text{open}} = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2} \\Delta^{2}}{2 m_{i} k_{B} T_{i}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{loss}} = \\frac{q B_{0}}{2\\pi m_{i}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2} \\Delta^{2}}{2 m_{i} k_{B} T_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThese results are to be reported as a two-entry row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2} \\Delta^{2}}{2 m_{i} k_{B} T_{i}}\\right) & \\frac{q B_{0}}{2\\pi m_{i}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{q^{2} B_{0}^{2} \\Delta^{2}}{2 m_{i} k_{B} T_{i}}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3719203"}]}
