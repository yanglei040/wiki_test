By applying the celebrated Kruskal–Shafranov condition, you will learn to quantitatively assess whether a given configuration is vulnerable to this destructive instability.", "problem": "Consider an ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) screw pinch: a straight, cylindrical plasma column of radius $a$ with an axial magnetic field $B_{z}$ and an azimuthal magnetic field $B_{\\theta}(r)$ produced by an axial current density.

Small-amplitude normal modes are labeled by the azimuthal mode number $m$, where $m=0$ is the sausage mode and $m=1$ is the kink mode.

Your final answer should be the computed $q(a)$.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), is well-posed with a clear and consistent set of definitions and data, and is expressed in objective scientific language.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the edge safety factor, $q(a)$, based on the provided definition. A magnetic field line is a curve in space, $\\vec{l}(s)$, whose tangent is everywhere parallel to the magnetic field vector, $\\vec{B}$. This condition is expressed by the differential equation $d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{B} = 0$. In cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, the infinitesimal displacement vector is $d\\vec{l} = dr\\,\\hat{r} + r\\,d\\theta\\,\\hat{\\theta} + dz\\,\\hat{z}$. The magnetic field in the screw pinch is given by $\\vec{B} = B_{\\theta}(r)\\,\\hat{\\theta} + B_{z}\\,\\hat{z}$, where we assume the unperturbed radial component of the field is zero, $B_r=0$.\n\nThe field line equation can be written in component form as:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{B_r} = \\frac{r\\,d\\theta}{B_{\\theta}(r)} = \\frac{dz}{B_z}\n$$\nSince $B_r=0$, we must have $dr=0$. This means that the magnetic field lines lie on cylindrical surfaces of constant radius $r$. We are interested in the safety factor at the edge of the plasma column, so we consider a field line on the surface $r=a$. The differential equation for this field line is:\n$$\n\\frac{a\\,d\\theta}{B_{\\theta}(a)} = \\frac{dz}{B_z}\n$$\nThis equation describes the helical path of the magnetic field line. We can rearrange it to find the rate of change of the axial position $z$ with respect to the poloidal angle $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{dz}{d\\theta} = \\frac{a B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)}\n$$\nThe problem defines the safety factor, $q(a)$, as \"the number of axial wavelengths per one $2\\pi$ poloidal circuit\". To formalize this, we first calculate the total axial distance, $\\Delta z$, that a field line travels while completing one full poloidal circuit (i.e., $\\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi$). Assuming $B_z$ and $B_{\\theta}(a)$ are constant along the path of the field line (which is true for a straight screw pinch with axial symmetry), we can integrate the equation above:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{a B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)} d\\theta = 2\\pi \\frac{a B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)}\n$$\nThis distance $\\Delta z$ is the pitch length of the helical magnetic field line at the plasma edge.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, $q(a)$ is the number of axial wavelengths, $\\lambda$, that fit into this distance $\\Delta z$. Therefore:\n$$\nq(a) = \\frac{\\Delta z}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( 2\\pi \\frac{a B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem also provides the relationship between the axial wavenumber $k$ and the wavelength $\\lambda$: $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$. We can express $\\lambda$ in terms of $k$ as $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$. Substituting this into the expression for $q(a)$:\n$$\nq(a) = \\frac{k}{2\\pi} \\left( 2\\pi \\frac{a B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the desired formula for the edge safety factor:\n$$\nq(a) = \\frac{k a B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)}\n$$\nThe second step is to evaluate $q(a)$ using the provided numerical data for the $m=1$ kink mode analysis. The problem gives the dimensionless parameters $ka=0.5$ and the ratio of magnetic field components $B_{z}/B_{\\theta}(a)=1$. We substitute these values into our derived expression for $q(a)$:\n$$\nq(a) = (ka) \\left( \\frac{B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)} \\right) = (0.5)(1) = 0.5\n$$\nThe third step is to assess the stability of the pinch with respect to the $m=1$ kink mode using the Kruskal–Shafranov stability condition. The Kruskal-Shafranov condition provides a threshold for the onset of the ideal external $m=1$ kink instability. For a periodic screw pinch, this instability is excited when the pitch of the helical instability matches the pitch of the magnetic field lines at the plasma edge. The plasma is stable if the pitch of the magnetic field lines, $L_p = \\Delta z = 2\\pi a B_z / B_{\\theta}(a)$, is greater than the wavelength of the perturbation, $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$.\n\nThe stability condition is $L_p > \\lambda$, which translates to:\n$$\n2\\pi \\frac{a B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)} > \\frac{2\\pi}{k}\n$$\nDividing by $2\\pi$ and multiplying by $k$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{k a B_z}{B_{\\theta}(a)} > 1\n$$\nRecognizing the left-hand side as our expression for $q(a)$, the Kruskal-Shafranov stability condition for the $m=1$ mode is simply:\n$$\nq(a) > 1\n$$\nWe calculated the value of the edge safety factor for the given parameters to be $q(a)=0.5$. Comparing this value to the stability criterion:\n$$\n0.5  1\n$$\nSince $q(a)$ is not greater than $1$, the Kruskal-Shafranov condition for stability is not satisfied.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires starting from first principles to justify the ion cyclotron frequency $\\Omega_i$ and the ion thermal speed $v_{thi}$.\n\nThe ion cyclotron frequency, or gyrofrequency, describes the circular motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field. The motion is governed by the Lorentz force, $\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$. For gyromotion, we consider a region with no electric field ($\\mathbf{E}=0$) and analyze the magnetic component of the force, $\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$. For an ion, the charge is $q = Ze$. The equation of motion is given by Newton's second law:\n$$m_i \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = Ze(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$$\nThis force is always perpendicular to the ion's velocity $\\mathbf{v}$, so it does no work and the ion's kinetic energy is constant. The motion can be decomposed into a component parallel to the magnetic field, which is force-free and thus at a constant velocity, and a component perpendicular to the field. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force for this perpendicular motion, causing the ion to move in a circle. Let $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$ be the velocity component perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$. The magnitude of the centripetal force required for circular motion of radius $\\rho_i$ is $F_c = m_i v_{\\perp}^2 / \\rho_i$. The magnitude of the magnetic force is $F_B = Ze v_{\\perp} B$, since $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$. Equating these forces, we have:\n$$ \\frac{m_i v_{\\perp}^2}{\\rho_i} = Ze v_{\\perp} B $$\nThe angular frequency of this circular motion is the ion cyclotron frequency, defined as $\\Omega_i = v_{\\perp} / \\rho_i$. From the force balance equation, we can solve for this frequency:\n$$ \\Omega_i = \\frac{ZeB}{m_i} $$\nThis expression for the ion cyclotron frequency is derived from the first principle of the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle.\n\nNext, we define the ion thermal speed $v_{thi}$ from kinetic theory. For a plasma species in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T_i$, the particles have a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to the temperature. In three dimensions, the average kinetic energy is $\\frac{3}{2} k_B T_i$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. However, the gyromotion occurs in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, which involves two degrees of freedom. The average kinetic energy in these two degrees of freedom is $2 \\times (\\frac{1}{2} k_B T_i) = k_B T_i$. A common and physically motivated definition for the characteristic thermal speed used in calculating the gyroradius is the speed $v_{thi}$ such that the associated kinetic energy is equal to this average perpendicular energy. That is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{thi}^2 = k_B T_i $$\nSolving for $v_{thi}$, we get:\n$$ v_{thi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T_i}{m_i}} $$\nThis definition corresponds to the root-mean-square speed in two dimensions for a Maxwellian distribution.\n\nThe ion gyroradius, or Larmor radius, $\\rho_i$, is defined as the radius of the circular gyromotion. The problem provides the definition $\\rho_i = v_{thi}/\\Omega_i$.
