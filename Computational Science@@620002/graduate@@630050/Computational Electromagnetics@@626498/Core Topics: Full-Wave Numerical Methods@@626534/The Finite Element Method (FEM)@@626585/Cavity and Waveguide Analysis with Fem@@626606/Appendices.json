{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in applying the Finite Element Method to any physical system is to translate the governing partial differential equations into a so-called \"weak form.\" This practice guides you through this essential process for a uniform waveguide, starting from Maxwell's equations to derive the two-dimensional eigenproblem for Transverse Electric (TE) modes [@problem_id:3291519]. Mastering this derivation is fundamental to understanding how complex waveguide structures are analyzed computationally.", "problem": "Consider a uniform, source-free, lossless, homogeneous, isotropic electromagnetic waveguide that is invariant along the $\\,\\hat{z}\\,$ axis, with a bounded, simply connected cross-section $\\,\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\,$ and boundary $\\,\\partial\\Omega\\,$ that is a Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC).

It represents a standard and non-trivial problem in computational electromagnetics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis begins with the time-harmonic, source-free Maxwell's equations in a homogeneous, isotropic medium with permittivity $\\varepsilon$ and permeability $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -j\\omega\\mu\\mathbf{H} \\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} &= j\\omega\\varepsilon\\mathbf{E} \\\\\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} &= 0 \\\\\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{H} &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhere a time-dependence of $\\exp(j\\omega t)$ is assumed. Given that the waveguide is uniform along the $\\hat{z}$ axis, the fields are assumed to have a spatial dependence of the form $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}_t, z) = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}_t) \\exp(-j\\beta z)$, where $\\mathbf{F}$ is either $\\mathbf{E}$ or $\\mathbf{H}$, $\\mathbf{r}_t = (x,y)$ is the transverse position vector, and $\\beta$ is the propagation constant. Under this assumption, the del operator can be decomposed as $\\nabla = \\nabla_t - j\\beta\\hat{z}$, where $\\nabla_t = \\hat{x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\hat{y}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ is the transverse del operator.\n\nThe electromagnetic fields can be decomposed into transverse ($\\mathbf{E}_t$, $\\mathbf{H}_t$) and longitudinal ($E_z$, $H_z$) components: $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{E}_t + E_z\\hat{z}$ and $\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}_t + H_z\\hat{z}$.\n\nThe modal families are defined based on the presence of longitudinal field components:\n1.  **Transverse Electric (TE) modes**: The electric field is purely transverse to the direction of propagation. This is defined by $E_z=0$ for all $(x,y,z)$ and a non-trivial $H_z \\neq 0$.\n2.  **Transverse Magnetic (TM) modes**: The magnetic field is purely transverse to the direction of propagation. This is defined by $H_z=0$ for all $(x,y,z)$ and a non-trivial $E_z \\neq 0$.\n3.  **Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) modes**: Both the electric and magnetic fields are purely transverse to the direction of propagation. This is defined by $E_z=0$ and $H_z=0$. For a non-trivial TEM mode to exist, the cutoff wavenumber $k_c$ must be zero, which implies $\\nabla_t^2 \\Phi = 0$ for the electric potential $\\Phi$. For a simply connected domain $\\Omega$ bounded by a single Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC), the boundary condition requires $\\Phi$ to be constant on $\\partial\\Omega$. By the maximum principle for Laplace's equation, $\\Phi$ must be constant throughout $\\Omega$, leading to a trivial zero field. Thus, TEM modes cannot exist in this configuration.\n\nWe now focus on deriving the governing equation for TE modes. A general wave equation can be derived by taking the curl of Maxwell's first curl equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}) - \\nabla^2\\mathbf{E} = -j\\omega\\mu(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H}) $$\nSince the medium is source-free, $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=0$. Substituting the second curl equation yields:\n$$ -\\nabla^2\\mathbf{E} = -j\\omega\\mu(j\\omega\\varepsilon\\mathbf{E}) = \\omega^2\\mu\\varepsilon\\mathbf{E} $$\nDefining the electromagnetic wavenumber as $k=\\omega\\sqrt{\\mu\\varepsilon}$, we obtain the vector Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\mathbf{E} + k^2\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nA similar derivation yields the same equation for the magnetic field, $(\\nabla^2 + k^2)\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{0}$. We are interested in the longitudinal component $H_z$ for TE modes. The $\\hat{z}$-component of this vector equation is:\n$$ (\\nabla^2 + k^2)H_z = 0 $$\nUsing the decomposition $\\nabla^2 = \\nabla_t^2 + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}$ and substituting $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\to -j\\beta$, we find $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\to (-j\\beta)^2 = -\\beta^2$. The equation for the scalar field $H_z(\\mathbf{r}_t)$ becomes:\n$$ (\\nabla_t^2 - \\beta^2 + k^2)H_z = 0 $$\nThis is typically written as a standard 2D Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\nabla_t^2 H_z + k_c^2 H_z = 0 $$\nwhere $k_c^2 = k^2 - \\beta^2$ is the square of the cutoff wavenumber. This is the required strong-form partial differential equation (PDE) for the TE longitudinal field component $H_z$.\n\nNext, we derive the boundary condition on $H_z$ at the PEC boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. The PEC condition is that the tangential component of the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ must vanish at the conductor's surface: $\\hat{n} \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. This implies that any tangential component of $\\mathbf{E}$ is zero. On the cylindrical surface of the waveguide, the normal $\\hat{n}$ is purely transverse, so there are two orthogonal tangential directions: one along the axis, $\\hat{z}$, and one in the transverse plane, $\\hat{t} = \\hat{z} \\times \\hat{n}$.\nThe condition requires $E_z=0$ and $\\mathbf{E}_t \\cdot \\hat{t} = 0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. For TE modes, $E_z=0$ is satisfied everywhere. We must enforce the second condition. The transverse fields can be expressed in terms of the longitudinal fields. For TE modes ($E_z=0$), the transverse electric field is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_t = \\frac{-j\\omega\\mu}{k_c^2}(\\hat{z} \\times \\nabla_t H_z) $$\nApplying the boundary condition $\\mathbf{E}_t \\cdot \\hat{t} = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{-j\\omega\\mu}{k_c^2}(\\hat{z} \\times \\nabla_t H_z) \\cdot \\hat{t} = 0 $$\nUsing the scalar triple product identity $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}) = \\mathbf{b} \\cdot (\\mathbf{c} \\times \\mathbf{a})$:\n$$ (\\nabla_t H_z) \\cdot (\\hat{t} \\times \\hat{z}) = 0 $$\nSince $\\hat{n} = \\hat{t} \\times \\hat{z}$ is the outward unit normal to the boundary curve $\\partial\\Omega$ in the transverse plane, the condition becomes:\n$$ (\\nabla_t H_z) \\cdot \\hat{n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega $$\nThis is the normal derivative, usually written as $\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial n} = 0$. This is a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition for $H_z$.\n\nThe problem is now cast as an eigenvalue problem for the transverse Laplacian operator: find eigenvalues $\\lambda = k_c^2$ and corresponding eigenfunctions $H_z$ satisfying:\n$$ -\\nabla_t^2 H_z = \\lambda H_z \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega $$\n\nTo formulate the Galerkin weak form, we introduce a test function $v$ from an appropriate function space, which for a Neumann problem is the Sobolev space $V = H^1(\\Omega)$. We multiply the PDE by $v$ and integrate over the cross-sectional domain $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} v (-\\nabla_t^2 H_z) \\, dA = \\lambda \\int_{\\Omega} v H_z \\, dA $$\nWe apply Green's first identity (integration by parts in multiple dimensions) to the left-hand side:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla_t v) \\cdot (\\nabla_t H_z) \\, dA - \\oint_{\\partial\\Omega} v ((\\nabla_t H_z) \\cdot \\hat{n}) \\, ds = \\lambda \\int_{\\Omega} v H_z \\, dA $$\nThe boundary integral vanishes because $(\\nabla_t H_z) \\cdot \\hat{n} = \\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial n} = 0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. This leaves the weak-form eigenproblem: Find a non-trivial trial function $H_z \\in V$ and an eigenvalue $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that for every test function $v \\in V$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla_t v) \\cdot (\\nabla_t H_z) \\, dA = \\lambda \\int_{\\Omega} v H_z \\, dA $$\nThis is the sought-after Galerkin weak form.\n\nFinally, we express the propagation constant $\\beta$ in terms of $k$ and $\\lambda$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of the weak form formulation corresponds to the eigenvalue of the operator $-\\nabla_t^2$. As established, this eigenvalue is the square of the cutoff wavenumber, $\\lambda = k_c^2$. The fundamental dispersion relation for a waveguide mode connects the medium wavenumber $k$, the propagation constant $\\beta$, and the cutoff wavenumber $k_c$:\n$$ k^2 = \\beta^2 + k_c^2 $$\nSubstituting $\\lambda$ for $k_c^2$, we arrive at the final expression relating the three quantities:\n$$ k^2 = \\beta^2 + \\lambda $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express $\\beta^2$ explicitly in terms of $k$ and $\\lambda$. This form is unambiguous as it avoids the sign and branch-cut choices associated with taking a square root to solve for $\\beta$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\beta^{2} = k^{2} - \\lambda} $$", "id": "3291519"}, {"introduction": "A common pitfall when using standard Lagrange elements for vector field problems is the emergence of non-physical, or \"spurious,\" solutions that contaminate the spectrum.

The vector electric field $\\mathbf{E}_h = (E_x, E_y)$ is approximated within each element using linear basis functions. At each node $i$ of the mesh, we associate two degrees of freedom (DOFs), corresponding to the $x$ and $y$ components of the electric field, $(u_{ix}, u_{iy})$. The field approximation is thus:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{E}_h(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{nodes}} \\left( u_{ix} N_i(x,y) \\hat{x} + u_{iy} N_i(x,y) \\hat{y} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{nodes}} \\left( u_{ix} \\mathbf{N}_{ix} + u_{iy} \\mathbf{N}_{iy} \\right)\n    $$\n    where $N_i$ are the scalar linear (P1) Lagrange basis functions, and $\\mathbf{N}_{ix} = N_i \\hat{x}$, $\\mathbf{N}_{iy} = N_i \\hat{y}$ are the vector basis functions.\n\n2.  **Elemental Matrix Formulation**\n    Substituting the expansion of $\\mathbf{E}_h$ and using $\\mathbf{v}_h$ from the same basis function space, we obtain a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem $(K_{\\mathrm{curl}} + \\eta K_{\\mathrm{div}})\\mathbf{u} = \\lambda M \\mathbf{u}$. The global matrices are assembled from elemental contributions. For a single triangular element $\\Omega_e$ with nodes $i, j, k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the $6 \\times 6$ elemental matrices are computed. The basis functions $N_i$ have constant gradients over the element.\n\n    *   **Elemental Mass Matrix ($M^e$)**: Represents the inner product of basis functions.\n        $$\n        M^e_{(i\\alpha)(j\\beta)} = \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\mathbf{N}_{i\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_{j\\beta} \\, d\\Omega_e = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} \\int_{\\Omega_e} N_i N_j \\, d\\Omega_e\n        $$\n        where $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\{x, y\\}$.

Each rectangular cell is split into two triangles. The elemental matrices are computed for each triangle and assembled into global sparse matrices. The homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, $E_x=0$ and $E_y=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$, are enforced by eliminating all DOFs associated with boundary nodes from the final linear system. This results in a reduced system of equations for the interior DOFs only.\n\n4.  **Eigenvalue Solution**\n    The system to solve is $(K_{red} + \\eta K_{\\mathrm{div},red})\\mathbf{u}_{int} = \\lambda M_{red}\\mathbf{u}_{int}$, where the subscript 'red' denotes matrices reduced to the set of interior DOFs. To find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ closest to zero, a shift-invert spectral transformation is employed. The problem is rephrased to find the largest magnitude eigenvalues of $(K_{sys} - \\sigma M)^{-1} M$, where $K_{sys} = K_{red} + \\eta K_{\\mathrm{div},red}$ and $\\sigma$ is a small shift (e.g., $\\sigma = 10^{-8}$). This is solved efficiently using the Lanczos algorithm implemented in `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh`.\n\n5.  **Spurious Mode Analysis**\n    For the unstabilized case ($\\eta = 0$), the kernel of the curl-curl operator contains gradient fields ($\\mathbf{E} = \\nabla \\phi$), which are curl-free. Nodal elements support such non-physical modes, which manifest as eigenvalues that are numerically close to zero. The number of these spurious modes is related to the number of interior nodes. When stabilization is applied ($\\eta > 0$), the grad-div term penalizes these modes since they generally have a non-zero divergence. This pushes their corresponding eigenvalues away from zero, effectively \"cleaning\" the low-frequency spectrum. The program counts the number of computed eigenvalues with magnitude less than a threshold $\\tau=10^{-10}$ to quantify the presence of these spurious modes.\n\nThe implementation follows these steps for each test case provided in the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.sparse import lil_matrix\nfrom scipy.sparse.linalg import eigsh\nfrom scipy.linalg import LinAlgError\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the test suite and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # (nx, ny, eta, k, tau)\n        (8, 8, 0.0, 30, 1e-10),       # Case A\n        (8, 8, 1e-2, 30, 1e-10),      # Case B\n        (12, 12, 0.0, 30, 1e-10),     # Case C\n        (12, 12, 1e-2, 30, 1e-10),    # Case D\n        (8, 8, 1.0, 30, 1e-10),       # Case E\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        nx, ny, eta, k, tau = case\n        count = run_fem_simulation(nx, ny, eta, k, tau)\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef run_fem_simulation(nx, ny, eta, k, tau):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the FEM simulation for a single test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

The PEC boundary condition on the cavity walls is $\\mathbf{n} \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal and $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field. Let the fields be classified into transverse magnetic (TM$_z$) modes with nonzero $E_z$ and transverse electric (TE$_z$) modes with nonzero $H_z$. Starting from Maxwell's equations and the PEC boundary conditions, the axial field components $E_z$ and $H_z$ satisfy scalar Helmholtz eigenproblems on the cavity domain.\n\nIntroduce a symmetry plane at $x = a/2$. Define the parity of a scalar field $f(x,y,z)$ with respect to the symmetry plane as follows: write $x = a/2 + \\xi$ and set $P[f](m) = +1$ if $f$ is even in $\\xi$ around the plane and $P[f](m) = -1$ if $f$ is odd in $\\xi$ around the plane, for the $x$-index $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. An electric wall symmetry plane is one for which the tangential electric field is antisymmetric across the plane, which reduces the problem to a half-domain with an essential boundary condition for the axial scalar of the corresponding family. A magnetic wall symmetry plane is one for which the tangential magnetic field is antisymmetric across the plane, which reduces the problem to a half-domain with an essential boundary condition for the axial scalar of the corresponding family. In both cases, the other parity gives a natural boundary condition for the axial scalar.\n\nUsing separation of variables, derive the $x$-dependence of $E_z$ for TM$_z$ and $H_z$ for TE$_z$ and determine their parities $P[E_z](m)$ and $P[H_z](m)$ with respect to the plane $x = a/2$.

The axial scalar ($E_z$ for TM$_z$, $H_z$ for TE$_z$) satisfies a scalar Helmholtz eigenproblem with appropriate boundary conditions induced by the PEC walls. Specifically:\n- For TM$_z$ modes, the axial electric field $E_z$ is tangential to the cavity walls normal to $x$, $y$, and $z$, so the PEC condition forces $E_z = 0$ at $x=0,a$, $y=0,b$, and $z=0,d$.

The symmetry plane at $x=a/2$ permits reduction to the half-domain $x \\in [0,a/2]$ with an appropriate boundary condition at $x=a/2$. For the axial scalar obeying the scalar Helmholtz equation, an odd parity across the plane enforces a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition (the scalar vanishes at the plane), while an even parity enforces a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition (normal derivative vanishes at the plane). This corresponds to the usual finite element method interpretation: odd parity gives an essential boundary on the axial scalar; even parity gives a natural boundary on the axial scalar.\n\nTherefore, for TM$_z$ (axial scalar $E_z$),\n$$\nI_{D}^{\\mathrm{TM}}(m) = \\frac{1 - P[E_z](m)}{2} = \\frac{1 - (-1)^{m+1}}{2} = \\frac{1 + (-1)^{m}}{2}, \\qquad\nI_{N}^{\\mathrm{TM}}(m) = \\frac{1 + P[E_z](m)}{2} = \\frac{1 + (-1)^{m+1}}{2} = \\frac{1 - (-1)^{m}}{2}.\n$$\n\nFor TE$_z$ (axial scalar $H_z$),\n$$\nI_{D}^{\\mathrm{TE}}(m) = \\frac{1 - P[H_z](m)}{2} = \\frac{1 - (-1)^{m}}{2}, \\qquad\nI_{N}^{\\mathrm{TE}}(m) = \\frac{1 + P[H_z](m)}{2} = \\frac{1 + (-1)^{m}}{2}.\n$$\n\nThe symmetry-plane types in terms of tangential field antisymmetry are consistent with these scalar reductions:\n- An electric wall symmetry plane (tangential $\\mathbf{E}$ antisymmetric) forces the axial scalar of the TM$_z$ family, $E_z$, to be odd across the plane, i.e., $m$ even, giving $I_{D}^{\\mathrm{TM}}(m) = 1$ and $I_{N}^{\\mathrm{TM}}(m) = 0$, while for TE$_z$ it forces $H_z$ to be even, i.e., $m$ even, giving $I_{D}^{\\mathrm{TE}}(m) = 0$ and $I_{N}^{\\mathrm{TE}}(m) = 1$.\n- A magnetic wall symmetry plane (tangential $\\mathbf{H}$ antisymmetric) forces the axial scalar of the TE$_z$ family, $H_z$, to be odd across the plane, i.e., $m$ odd, giving $I_{D}^{\\mathrm{TE}}(m) = 1$ and $I_{N}^{\\mathrm{TE}}(m) = 0$, while for TM$_z$ it forces $E_z$ to be even, i.e., $m$ odd, giving $I_{D}^{\\mathrm{TM}}(m) = 0$ and $I_{N}^{\\mathrm{TM}}(m) = 1$.\n\nFinally, we present the requested six analytic expressions in the order specified:\n$$\nP[E_z](m) = (-1)^{m+1}, \\quad P[H_z](m) = (-1)^{m}, \\quad I_{D}^{\\mathrm{TM}}(m) = \\frac{1 + (-1)^{m}}{2}, \\quad I_{N}^{\\mathrm{TM}}(m) = \\frac{1 - (-1)^{m}}{2}, \\quad I_{D}^{\\mathrm{TE}}(m) = \\frac{1 - (-1)^{m}}{2}, \\quad I_{N}^{\\mathrm{TE}}(m) = \\frac{1 + (-1)^{m}}{2}.\n$$\nThese are closed-form analytic indicator functions in $m$ that encode the mode parities and the resulting symmetry-reduced scalar subproblems for finite element method formulations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}(-1)^{m+1} & (-1)^{m} & \\frac{1 + (-1)^{m}}{2} & \\frac{1 - (-1)^{m}}{2} & \\frac{1 - (-1)^{m}}{2} & \\frac{1 + (-1)^{m}}{2}\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3291512"}]}
