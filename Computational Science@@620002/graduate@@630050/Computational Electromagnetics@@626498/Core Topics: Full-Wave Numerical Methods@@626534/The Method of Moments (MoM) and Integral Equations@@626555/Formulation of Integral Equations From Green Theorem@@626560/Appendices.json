Using $g_{3D}$ in a two-dimensional boundary integral derivation invalidates the representation because $g_{3D}$ is not a fundamental solution of $(\\nabla^2 + k^2)$ in two dimensions; the interior field reconstructed from the boundary integral will not satisfy the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation.\n\nB. When $g_{2D}$ is used, the single-layer kernel has a logarithmic singularity as $|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'| \\to 0$, and the double-layer kernel behaves like $1/|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'|$. If $g_{3D}$ is used instead, these respective singularities are $1/|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'|$ and $1/|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'|^2$.

In 2D, however, $(\\nabla^2_{2D} + k^2)g_{3D} \\neq -\\delta_{2D}$.

Incorrect.** The coefficient in the jump relation for the double-layer potential across a smooth boundary is determined by the solid angle subtended by the domain. For a point on a smooth boundary, the domain occupies half the space, so the solid angle is half the total solid angle of the space. In 2D, this is $\\pi / (2\\pi) = 1/2$.

The 2D Green's function represents a cylindrical wave, which conserves energy over an expanding cylinder, so its amplitude decays as $1/\\sqrt{r}$. The 3D Green's function represents a spherical wave, conserving energy over an expanding sphere, so its amplitude decays as $1/r$. The statement claims the opposite.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** The dimensionality of the fundamental solution is critical. The boundary integral equation is an exact transformation of the governing partial differential equation. Using the wrong kernel (from the wrong dimension) means the resulting integral equation is no longer equivalent to the original problem. No simple reweighting of the unknown boundary density can fix this fundamental mismatch.\n\n**F.

Evaluate the $g_0$ and $\\nabla g_0$ contributions analytically on the local planar parameterization of each source triangle (e.g., by a polar change of variables or a Duffy transform) and combine them with the numerical quadrature of the bounded remainders $g_{\\mathrm{reg}}$ and $\\nabla g_{\\mathrm{reg}}$ on the original elements.

As $R \\to 0$, the remainder $\\frac{e^{-ikR} - e^{-ikR_c}}{4\\pi R}$ still behaves like $1/R$ unless $R_c = 0$. This method is flawed. Furthermore, ignoring the stronger singularity in $\\nabla g$ is a critical error.\n-   **Option C**: Subtracting a term that is more singular ($1/R^2$) than the original kernel ($1/R$) is mathematically invalid. The integral of the subtracted term would be divergent, making the \"analytical\" part impossible to compute.\n-   **Option D**: This describes regularization, not singularity subtraction. By replacing $R$ with $\\sqrt{R^2+a^2}$, the integral operator itself is modified.
