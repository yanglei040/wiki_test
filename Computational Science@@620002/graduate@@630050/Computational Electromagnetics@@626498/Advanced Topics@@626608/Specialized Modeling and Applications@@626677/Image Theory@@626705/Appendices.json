The grounded connection fixes the conductor’s potential to $V=0$ on the spherical surface $r=a$, and the potential vanishes at spatial infinity. Using only Coulomb’s law, the electrostatic boundary conditions for a PEC, and the uniqueness theorem for electrostatics, proceed as follows:\n\n- Justify the replacement of the conducting sphere by an appropriate image configuration and determine the magnitude $q'$ and the location $r'$ (measured from the center along the $z$-axis) of a single image charge that enforces $V=0$ on $r=a$ for all polar angles $\\theta$.\n- From the resulting external potential, derive the induced surface charge density $\\sigma(\\theta)$ on the sphere via the normal-electric-field boundary condition on a PEC, and then integrate $\\sigma(\\theta)$ over the sphere to obtain the total induced charge $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}$.\n- Your result must demonstrate that $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}$ is not equal to $-q$, and must be expressed in closed form in terms of $q$, $a$, and $r_{0}$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a standard, well-posed problem in electrostatics, grounded in fundamental principles (Coulomb's Law, properties of conductors, uniqueness theorem) and uses clear, objective language. All necessary information is provided, and the setup is physically and mathematically consistent.\n\nThe problem asks for the total charge induced on a grounded conducting sphere. We will solve this using the method of images. The uniqueness theorem for electrostatics states that for a volume bounded by surfaces on which the potential is specified, there is only one potential function that satisfies Laplace's equation ($\\nabla^2 V = 0$) within the volume and the given boundary conditions.\n\nIn our case, the volume is the region outside the sphere ($r>a$). The charge density is zero in this region, except for the point charge $q$ at $z=r_0$. Thus, we must solve Poisson's equation $\\nabla^2 V = -\\delta(\\mathbf{r} - r_0\\mathbf{\\hat{z}})/\\epsilon_0$ for $r>a$ subject to the boundary conditions $V(r=a) = 0$ and $V(r\\to\\infty) = 0$.\n\nThe method of images replaces the complex problem of the induced charges on the sphere with a simpler equivalent problem. We remove the sphere and introduce an \"image\" charge $q'$ at a location inside the region formerly occupied by the sphere ($r<a$). If we can choose the magnitude $q'$ and location $r'$ of this image charge such that the potential on the spherical surface $r=a$ is zero, then the potential produced by the original charge $q$ and the image charge $q'$ will be the correct and unique solution for the potential in the exterior region $r>a$.\n\nBy symmetry, the image charge $q'$ must lie on the z-axis. Let its position be $z=r'$. Let's find the potential at an arbitrary point $P$ on the spherical surface $r=a$. The coordinates of $P$ are $(a, \\theta, \\phi)$ in spherical coordinates. The distance from the source charge $q$ at $(0,0,r_0)$ to point $P$ is $d_q = \\sqrt{a^2 + r_0^2 - 2ar_0\\cos\\theta}$. The distance from the image charge $q'$ at $(0,0,r')$ to point $P$ is $d_{q'} = \\sqrt{a^2 + r'^2 - 2ar'\\cos\\theta}$.\n\nThe total potential at point $P$ is the sum of the potentials from $q$ and $q'$:\n$$V(a, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q}{d_q} + \\frac{q'}{d_{q'}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{a^2 + r_0^2 - 2ar_0\\cos\\theta}} + \\frac{q'}{\\sqrt{a^2 + r'^2 - 2ar'\\cos\\theta}} \\right)$$\nFor this potential to be zero for all values of $\\theta$, we must have:\n$$\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{a^2 + r_0^2 - 2ar_0\\cos\\theta}} = -\\frac{q'}{\\sqrt{a^2 + r'^2 - 2ar'\\cos\\theta}}$$\nSquaring both sides and cross-multiplying gives:\n$$q^2 (a^2 + r'^2 - 2ar'\\cos\\theta) = q'^2 (a^2 + r_0^2 - 2ar_0\\cos\\theta)$$\nThis equation must hold for any $\\theta$. We can equate the constant terms and the coefficients of $\\cos\\theta$:\n1. $q^2(a^2 + r'^2) = q'^2(a^2 + r_0^2)$\n2. $q^2(-2ar') = q'^2(-2ar_0) \\implies q^2 r' = q'^2 r_0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we get $q'^2 = q^2 \\frac{r'}{r_0}$. Substituting this into equation (1):\n$$q^2(a^2 + r'^2) = q^2 \\frac{r'}{r_0} (a^2 + r_0^2)$$\n$$a^2 + r'^2 = \\frac{r' a^2}{r_0} + r' r_0$$\n$$a^2 - r' r_0 = \\frac{r' a^2}{r_0} - r'^2 = \\frac{r'}{r_0} (a^2 - r' r_0)$$\nThis implies either $a^2 - r'r_0 = 0$ or $1 = r'/r_0$. The latter, $r'=r_0$, is invalid as the image charge must be inside the spherical boundary. Therefore, we must have $a^2 - r'r_0 = 0$, which gives the location of the image charge:\n$$r' = \\frac{a^2}{r_0}$$\nNow we find the magnitude $q'$ from $q'^2 = q^2 \\frac{r'}{r_0}$.\n$$q'^2 = q^2 \\frac{(a^2/r_0)}{r_0} = q^2 \\frac{a^2}{r_0^2} \\implies |q'| = |q| \\frac{a}{r_0}$$\nFrom the original potential equation, we see that $q$ and $q'$ must have opposite signs. Thus, the image charge is:\n$$q' = -q \\frac{a}{r_0}$$\n\nNow we find the induced surface charge density $\\sigma(\\theta)$ on the sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is given by $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$. The normal component of the electric field just outside the conductor's surface is related to the surface charge density by $\\sigma = \\epsilon_0 E_n$. The unit normal vector to the sphere is $\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}$. Thus, $E_n = \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{r}} = E_r = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r}$.\n\nThe potential for $r>a$ is:\n$$V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{r^2 + r_0^2 - 2rr_0\\cos\\theta}} + \\frac{q'}{\\sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'\\cos\\theta}} \\right)$$\nCalculating the radial electric field $E_r = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r}$:\n$$E_r = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q(r - r_0\\cos\\theta)}{(r^2 + r_0^2 - 2rr_0\\cos\\theta)^{3/2}} + \\frac{q'(r - r'\\cos\\theta)}{(r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'\\cos\\theta)^{3/2}} \\right]$$\nWe evaluate this at the surface $r=a$ and substitute $q'=-q(a/r_0)$ and $r'=a^2/r_0$. Let $D_s = (a^2 + r_0^2 - 2ar_0\\cos\\theta)$. The denominator of the term from the image charge becomes $(a^2 + (a^2/r_0)^2 - 2a(a^2/r_0)\\cos\\theta) = \\frac{a^2}{r_0^2} D_s$. The total radial field is:\n$$E_r(a,\\theta) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 D_s^{3/2}} \\left[ q(a - r_0\\cos\\theta) + \\frac{q'(a - r'\\cos\\theta)}{(\\frac{a^2}{r_0^2})^{3/2}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 D_s^{3/2}} \\left[ q(a - r_0\\cos\\theta) + \\frac{-q(a/r_0)(a - (a^2/r_0)\\cos\\theta)}{(a/r_0)^3} \\right]$$\nThe term in the square brackets simplifies as:\n$$ q(a - r_0\\cos\\theta) - q\\left(\\frac{r_0}{a}\\right)^2\\left(a - \\frac{a^2}{r_0}\\cos\\theta\\right) = q\\left[ (a - r_0\\cos\\theta) - \\left(\\frac{r_0^2}{a} - r_0\\cos\\theta\\right) \\right] = q\\left( a - \\frac{r_0^2}{a} \\right) = \\frac{q(a^2 - r_0^2)}{a} $$\nSo,\n$$E_r(a,\\theta) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(a^2-r_0^2)/a}{(a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0\\cos\\theta)^{3/2}}$$\nThe surface charge density is $\\sigma(\\theta) = \\epsilon_0 E_r(a,\\theta)$:\n$$\\sigma(\\theta) = \\frac{q(a^2-r_0^2)}{4\\pi a(a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0\\cos\\theta)^{3/2}}$$\n\nTo find the total induced charge $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}$, we integrate $\\sigma(\\theta)$ over the surface of the sphere. The differential surface area is $dS = a^2 \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi$.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} = \\int_S \\sigma(\\theta) dS = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi \\sigma(\\theta) a^2 \\sin\\theta d\\theta$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} = 2\\pi a^2 \\frac{q(a^2-r_0^2)}{4\\pi a} \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{(a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0\\cos\\theta)^{3/2}} d\\theta$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} = \\frac{q a (a^2-r_0^2)}{2} \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{(a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0\\cos\\theta)^{3/2}} d\\theta$$\nLet $u = \\cos\\theta$, so $du = -\\sin\\theta d\\theta$. The integration limits change from $[0, \\pi]$ to $[1, -1]$.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} = \\frac{q a (a^2-r_0^2)}{2} \\int_1^{-1} \\frac{-du}{(a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0 u)^{3/2}} = \\frac{q a (a^2-r_0^2)}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} (a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0 u)^{-3/2} du$$\nLet $v = a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0 u$, so $dv = -2ar_0 du$. The antiderivative of $v^{-3/2}$ is $-2v^{-1/2}$.\n$$\\int (v)^{-3/2} du = \\int (v)^{-3/2} \\frac{dv}{-2ar_0} = \\frac{1}{-2ar_0} (-2v^{-1/2}) = \\frac{1}{ar_0\\sqrt{v}}$$\nSo, the definite integral is:\n$$\\left[ \\frac{1}{ar_0\\sqrt{a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0 u}} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{ar_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2+r_0^2-2ar_0}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2+r_0^2+2ar_0}} \\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{ar_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(r_0-a)^2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(r_0+a)^2}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{ar_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_0-a} - \\frac{1}{r_0+a} \\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{ar_0} \\left( \\frac{(r_0+a)-(r_0-a)}{r_0^2-a^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{ar_0} \\frac{2a}{r_0^2-a^2} = \\frac{2}{r_0(r_0^2-a^2)}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}$:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} = \\frac{q a (a^2-r_0^2)}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{r_0(r_0^2-a^2)}\\right) = \\frac{q a (-(r_0^2-a^2))}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{r_0(r_0^2-a^2)}\\right)$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} = \\frac{-qa}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{r_0}\\right) = -q \\frac{a}{r_0}$$\nThis is indeed the same as the image charge $q'$.\n\nThe total induced charge is $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} = -q(a/r_0)$. The problem requires showing that this is not equal to $-q$. Since the charge $q$ is outside the sphere, $r_0 > a$, which implies that the fraction $a/r_0 < 1$. Consequently, $|Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}| = |-q(a/r_0)| = |q|(a/r_0) < |q|$. This demonstrates that $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} \\neq -q$.\n\nThe reason $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}$ is not $-q$ is due to the grounding. An uncharged, isolated conducting sphere would polarize, with negative charge accumulating on the near side and positive on the far side, keeping the net charge zero. By Gauss's Law, for a closed surface enclosing a charge, the total induced charge on the inner surface must be the negative of the enclosed charge. However, here the charge $q$ is external to the conductor.\nGrounding connects the sphere to an infinite reservoir of charge (the Earth) held at $V=0$. When the positive charge $q$ is brought near, it attracts electrons from the ground onto the sphere. This flow continues until the potential of the sphere becomes zero. The resulting total charge on the sphere, $Q_{\\mathrm{ind}} = -q(a/r_0)$, is precisely the amount required to satisfy the $V=0$ boundary condition. If the induced charge were $-q$, the potential on the sphere would be non-zero (it would be negative). Some of the electric field lines originating from $q$ do not terminate on the sphere but extend to infinity, which is also at $V=0$. The total flux terminating on the sphere is $\\int \\mathbf{E}\\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}/\\epsilon_0$. Since this flux is less in magnitude than the total flux from $q$ (which is $q/\\epsilon_0$), it follows that $|Q_{\\mathrm{ind}}| < |q|$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-q \\frac{a}{r_0}} $$", "id": "3316422"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond perfect conductors, the image method can be generalized to handle interfaces between different dielectric materials, a scenario common in many practical applications.

In finite-precision arithmetic with machine unit roundoff $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}}$, this leads to severe subtractive cancellation if the difference is formed naively term-by-term.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions above and the chain rule, analyze the asymptotic behavior of the difference $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}) - G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$ as $h \\to 0^{+}$, and deduce the conditioning of the naive subtraction in terms of $h$, $z$, $\\rho$, $k$, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}}$. Then, focusing strictly on fixed-precision arithmetic (i.e., $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}}$ is fixed and no extended precision is allowed), determine which of the following strategies will maintain $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ relative accuracy of $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ uniformly as $h \\to 0^{+}$ by analytic rescaling, regrouping, or reformulation, and which will not.\n\nChoose all that apply.\n\nA. Compute $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ by directly evaluating $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})$ and $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$ in double precision and subtracting them, summing any additional image terms (if present) in straightforward forward order from largest to smallest magnitude.\n\nB. For each symmetric image pair contributing a difference of the form $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{+})-G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{-})$ with $\\mathbf{r}_{\\pm}$ mirrored about $z=0$, algebraically factor common terms and evaluate the small differences using identities that avoid catastrophic cancellation, such as expressing $R_{+}-R_{-}$ via a difference-of-squares formula and evaluating $e^{i k (R_{-}-R_{+})}-1$ with a numerically stable routine for small arguments; more generally, replace the small-height difference by its first nonvanishing term obtained from a Taylor expansion in $h$.\n\nC. Use Kahan compensated summation over the list of image terms without any analytic regrouping or rescaling; this reduces rounding error of the summation and therefore guarantees $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}})$ relative error even when the exact result is $\\mathcal{O}(h)$.\n\nD. Reformulate the half-space Green’s function using its spectral (Sommerfeld) integral representation, and evaluate it via Ewald splitting or Poisson summation into a rapidly convergent sum of a real-space near-field and a spectral or modal far-field, each computed with matched accuracy; this avoids subtractive cancellation between nearly equal image contributions.\n\nE. Normalize each term $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})$ and $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$ by its own magnitude before subtraction (i.e., rescale terms individually), then subtract and unscale the result; this prevents loss of significance in the subtraction of nearly equal terms.\n\nAnswer by selecting the correct option(s).", "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n- **System:** A time-harmonic source above a planar Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) plane at $z=0$ in free space.\n- **Governing Equations:** Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain, represented via a dyadic Green's function.\n- **Proxy Kernel:** The scalar Helmholtz Green's function, $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}') = \\dfrac{e^{i k |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|}}{4 \\pi |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|}$, where $k$ is the free-space wavenumber.\n- **Source Location:** $\\mathbf{r}_{s}=(0,0,h)$ with $h>0$ being small.\n- **Image Source Location:** $\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}}=(0,0,-h)$, the mirror image of the source.\n- **Observation Point:** $\\mathbf{r}=(\\rho,0,z)$ with $z>0$.\n- **Potential Representation:** The scalar potential proxy is given by image theory as $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}) - G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$.\n- **Numerical Issue:** For small $h \\to 0^{+}$, the terms $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})$ and $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$ are nearly equal, leading to subtractive cancellation in finite-precision arithmetic with machine unit roundoff $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}}$.\n- **Task:** Analyze the asymptotic behavior of the difference as $h \\to 0^{+}$ and determine which of the provided strategies maintain $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ relative accuracy for $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ uniformly as $h \\to 0^{+}$ in fixed-precision arithmetic.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in computational electromagnetics and numerical analysis.

It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe scalar potential $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is given by the difference of two Green's function terms:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}) - G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})\n$$\nThe source and image locations are $\\mathbf{r}_{s}=(0,0,h)$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}}=(0,0,-h)$, respectively. The observation point is $\\mathbf{r}=(\\rho,0,z)$. The distances from the source and image source to the observation point are:\n$$\nR_{s} = |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_{s}| = \\sqrt{\\rho^2 + (z-h)^2}\n$$\n$$\nR_{im} = |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}}| = \\sqrt{\\rho^2 + (z+h)^2}\n$$\nThus, the potential is:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{e^{ikR_s}}{4\\pi R_s} - \\frac{e^{ikR_{im}}}{4\\pi R_{im}}\n$$\nAs the source height $h$ approaches $0$, we observe that $R_s \\to \\sqrt{\\rho^2+z^2}$ and $R_{im} \\to \\sqrt{\\rho^2+z^2}$. Consequently, $R_s \\approx R_{im}$, which leads to $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}) \\approx G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$. A direct numerical evaluation of this difference involves subtracting two nearly identical floating-point numbers, a classic case of catastrophic subtractive cancellation.\n\nTo analyze the severity of this issue, we find the asymptotic behavior of $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ for small $h$. We can view $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ as $f(h) - f(-h)$, where $f(h) = G(\\mathbf{r}, (0,0,h))$. A Taylor expansion around $h=0$ gives:\n$$\nf(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + \\mathcal{O}(h^2)\n$$\n$$\nf(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + \\mathcal{O}(h^2)\n$$\nThe difference is then:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = f(h) - f(-h) = 2 f'(0) h + \\mathcal{O}(h^3)\n$$\nThe leading-order behavior is linear in $h$. The derivative $f'(0)$ corresponds to $\\left. \\frac{\\partial G(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}')}{\\partial z'} \\right|_{z'=0}$, where $\\mathbf{r}'=(0,0,z')$.\nThe derivative of the Green's function with respect to the source coordinate $z'$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z'} \\left(\\frac{e^{ikR}}{4\\pi R}\\right) = \\frac{e^{ikR}(ikR - 1)}{4\\pi R^2} \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial z'}\n$$\nwhere $R = \\sqrt{\\rho^2+(z-z')^2}$. The derivative of $R$ is $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial z'} = -\\frac{z-z'}{R}$. Evaluating at $z'=0$, we have $R_0 = \\sqrt{\\rho^2+z^2}$ and $\\left.\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial z'}\\right|_{z'=0} = -z/R_0$.\nSo,\n$$\nf'(0) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z'} \\right|_{z'=0} = -\\frac{z}{4\\pi R_0^3} e^{ikR_0}(ikR_0 - 1)\n$$\nTherefore, for small $h$:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx -2h \\frac{z}{4\\pi R_0^3} e^{ikR_0}(ikR_0-1)\n$$\nThe magnitude of the individual terms $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})$ and $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$ is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, while the magnitude of their difference $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is $\\mathcal{O}(h)$.\nIn floating-point arithmetic, the absolute error in computing $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})$ is approximately $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}} |G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})|$. The absolute error of the difference is thus on the order of $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}} |G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})|$, which is $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}})$.\nThe relative error in the computed $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Relative Error} = \\frac{\\text{Absolute Error}}{|\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})|} \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}})}{\\mathcal{O}(h)} = \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}}}{h}\\right)\n$$\nAs $h \\to 0^{+}$, this relative error grows without bound. To maintain $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ relative accuracy (i.e., a bounded relative error, ideally $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}})$), a strategy must avoid this $1/h$ scaling.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Compute $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$ by directly evaluating $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})$ and $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$ in double precision and subtracting them, summing any additional image terms (if present) in straightforward forward order from largest to smallest magnitude.**\nThis option describes the naive subtraction that was analyzed above. As derived, this method suffers from catastrophic cancellation, leading to a relative error that scales as $\\mathcal{O}(1/h)$. It therefore fails to maintain $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ relative accuracy as $h \\to 0^{+}$. The mention of other image terms is irrelevant to the core cancellation issue between the primary source and its direct image.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. For each symmetric image pair contributing a difference of the form $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{+})-G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{-})$ with $\\mathbf{r}_{\\pm}$ mirrored about $z=0$, algebraically factor common terms and evaluate the small differences using identities that avoid catastrophic cancellation, such as expressing $R_{+}-R_{-}$ via a difference-of-squares formula and evaluating $e^{i k (R_{-}-R_{+})}-1$ with a numerically stable routine for small arguments; more generally, replace the small-height difference by its first nonvanishing term obtained from a Taylor expansion in $h$.**\nThis option proposes two valid analytical reformulations.\n1.  **Algebraic regrouping:** The small difference $R_{im} - R_s$ can be computed accurately as $R_{im} - R_s = \\frac{R_{im}^2 - R_s^2}{R_{im} + R_s} = \\frac{4zh}{R_{im} + R_s}$. The term $e^{ikR_s} - e^{ikR_{im}}$ can be factored as $e^{ikR_{im}}(e^{ik(R_s - R_{im})} - 1)$, where the complex exponential of a small argument minus $1$ can be computed accurately (e.g., using the `expm1` function or its complex equivalent). By carefully regrouping terms in the full expression for $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})$, the subtraction of nearly equal numbers is replaced by multiplications and divisions of well-behaved quantities.\n2.  **Taylor expansion:** Using the first nonvanishing term of the Taylor series, $\\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx 2h \\left. \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z'} \\right|_{z'=0}$, directly computes the $\\mathcal{O}(h)$ result without any subtraction. Both the factor $h$ and the derivative are computed separately and multiplied. This avoids cancellation entirely.\nBoth approaches are standard, effective techniques for this exact problem and will maintain a relative error of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}})$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Use Kahan compensated summation over the list of image terms without any analytic regrouping or rescaling; this reduces rounding error of the summation and therefore guarantees $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}})$ relative error even when the exact result is $\\mathcal{O}(h)$.**\nKahan summation is an algorithm designed to mitigate the accumulation of round-off error when summing a long sequence of floating-point numbers. It does not, and cannot, address subtractive cancellation in the difference of two nearly equal numbers. The loss of significant digits occurs within the single operation $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}) - G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$, before any summation algorithm could be applied to a larger list of terms. For just two terms, Kahan summation is equivalent to direct subtraction. The claim that it \"guarantees $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}})$ relative error\" in this context is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Reformulate the half-space Green’s function using its spectral (Sommerfeld) integral representation, and evaluate it via Ewald splitting or Poisson summation into a rapidly convergent sum of a real-space near-field and a spectral or modal far-field, each computed with matched accuracy; this avoids subtractive cancellation between nearly equal image contributions.**\nThis option proposes transforming the problem from the spatial domain to the spectral domain. The half-space Green's function can be written as a Sommerfeld integral. The term in the integrand responsible for the cancellation, $e^{-u_0|z-h|} - e^{-u_0(z+h)}$, can be analytically rewritten as $2e^{-u_0 z} \\sinh(u_0 h)$. For small $h$, $\\sinh(u_0h) \\approx u_0h$, making the $h$-dependence explicit and removing the numerical subtraction. The subsequent numerical integration is well-conditioned. While Ewald/Poisson methods are typically for periodic problems (infinite images), they are exemplars of the same principle: analytic reformulation to improve convergence and numerical stability. This general class of methods successfully avoids the cancellation problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Normalize each term $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})$ and $G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$ by its own magnitude before subtraction (i.e., rescale terms individually), then subtract and unscale the result; this prevents loss of significance in the subtraction of nearly equal terms.**\nThis strategy is ineffective. Let $G_s = G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s})$ and $G_{im} = G(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{s}^{\\mathrm{im}})$. As $h \\to 0^{+}$, we have $G_s \\approx G_{im}$, which means not only are their magnitudes nearly equal ($|G_s| \\approx |G_{im}|$), but their phases are also nearly equal. The proposed procedure involves calculating the difference of the normalized terms, $\\hat{G}_s - \\hat{G}_{im} = G_s/|G_s| - G_{im}/|G_{im}|$. Since $G_s \\approx G_{im}$, it follows that the unit-norm complex numbers $\\hat{G}_s$ and $\\hat{G}_{im}$ are also nearly equal. Subtracting them will result in the same catastrophic cancellation of significant digits as in the original problem. This normalization merely rearranges the calculation without addressing the fundamental instability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "3316475"}]}
