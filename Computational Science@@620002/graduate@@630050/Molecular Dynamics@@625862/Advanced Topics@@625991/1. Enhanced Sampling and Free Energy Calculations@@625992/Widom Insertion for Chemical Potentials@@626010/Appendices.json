It poses a standard, non-trivial problem in statistical mechanics and molecular simulation theory. The provided givens and assumptions are sufficient and appropriate for a rigorous derivation. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation from First Principles\n\n**1. The Widom Insertion Method for Excess Chemical Potential**\n\nThe excess chemical potential, $\\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}$, represents the contribution to the chemical potential arising from interactions between particles. In the canonical ($NVT$) ensemble, it is defined via the Widom test particle insertion method. The fundamental formula is:\n$$\n\\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}} = -k_B T \\ln \\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U) \\right\\rangle_N\n$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The term $\\Delta U$ represents the total potential energy of a \"test\" particle inserted at a random position $\\mathbf{r}_0$ in a system of $N$ particles. This energy is the sum of pairwise interactions between the test particle and the $N$ existing particles:\n$$\n\\Delta U = \\sum_{i=1}^N u(|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_0|)\n$$\nThe angled brackets $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_N$ denote an ensemble average over the configurations of the $N$-particle system.\n\n**2. Full vs. Truncated Potentials**\n\nThe problem involves two forms of the potential energy:\n- The full Lennard-Jones potential: $u_{\\mathrm{full}}(r) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{6} \\right]$ for all $r$.\n- The truncated potential used in the simulation: $u_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(r) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)$ for $r < r_c$ and $u_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(r) = 0$ for $r \\ge r_c$.\n\nThe excess chemical potential measured in the simulation, using the truncated potential for both generating configurations and measuring the test particle energy, is:\n$$\n\\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{trunc}} = -k_B T \\ln \\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{trunc}}) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{trunc}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{trunc}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N u_{\\mathrm{trunc}}(|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_0|)$ and the average is over the ensemble generated with $u_{\\mathrm{trunc}}$.\n\nThe true excess chemical potential corresponding to the full potential is:\n$$\n\\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{full}} = -k_B T \\ln \\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{full}}) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{full}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{full}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N u_{\\mathrm{full}}(|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_0|)$.\n\nThe tail correction, $\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}}$, is defined as the difference that must be added to the simulation result to recover the full-potential result: $\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}} = \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{full}} - \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{trunc}}$. A standard approximation, implicit in such corrections, is to assume the fluid structure (e.g., the radial distribution function) is well-described by the truncated potential. The correction then involves calculating the energetic contribution of the neglected tail of the potential, averaged over the configurations of the truncated system. Thus, we approximate $\\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{full}}$ by evaluating $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{full}}) \\rangle$ over the truncated ensemble:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\approx -k_B T \\ln \\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{full}}) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{trunc}} - (-k_B T \\ln \\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{trunc}}) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{trunc}})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\approx -k_B T \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{full}}) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{trunc}}}{\\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{trunc}}) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{trunc}}} \\right) = -k_B T \\ln \\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta[\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{full}} - \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{trunc}}]) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{trunc}}\n$$\nLet $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} = \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{full}} - \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{trunc}}$. This is the interaction energy of the test particle with all other particles beyond the cutoff $r_c$.\n\n**3. The Leading-Order (Mean-Field) Approximation**\n\nThe problem states that the correction should be treated at leading order. The potential $u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)$ decays rapidly with distance, so its value for $r > r_c$ is small. Consequently, the test particle energy contribution from the tail, $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}}$, is also small, meaning $\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\ll 1$. This justifies a first-order expansion. Using the approximations $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$ and $\\ln(1-y) \\approx -y$ for small $y$:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}}) \\right\\rangle \\approx \\left\\langle 1 - \\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\right\\rangle = 1 - \\beta \\left\\langle \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\right\\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}}) \\right\\rangle \\approx \\ln(1 - \\beta \\left\\langle \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\right\\rangle) \\approx -\\beta \\left\\langle \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the tail correction:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\approx -k_B T (-\\beta \\left\\langle \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\right\\rangle) = \\left\\langle \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThis shows that the leading-order tail correction to the excess chemical potential is simply the average potential energy of a test particle due to interactions with particles beyond the cutoff $r_c$.\n\n**4. The Mean-Field Integral**\n\nWe now express $\\langle \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\rangle$ as an integral. The average number of particles in a spherical shell of volume $dV = 4\\pi r^2 dr$ at a distance $r$ from the test particle is given by $\\rho g(r) dV$, where $\\rho$ is the number density and $g(r)$ is the radial distribution function. The average interaction energy is obtained by integrating the pair potential multiplied by this particle density over the relevant volume:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\approx \\left\\langle \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{tail}} \\right\\rangle = \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) \\rho g(r) (4\\pi r^2 dr)\n$$\nThe problem states to use the approximation that for separations beyond the cutoff, the fluid is unstructured, i.e., $g(r) \\approx 1$ for $r \\ge r_c$. The integral simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}} = 4\\pi\\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) r^2 dr\n$$\n\n**5. Evaluating the Integral for the Lennard-Jones Potential**\n\nWe now substitute the Lennard-Jones potential into the integral:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}} = 4\\pi\\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} 4\\epsilon \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{6} \\right] r^2 dr\n$$\nThe problem asks for the reduced correction $\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}}/\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}}}{\\epsilon} = 16\\pi\\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\sigma^{12}r^{-12} - \\sigma^6 r^{-6} \\right] r^2 dr\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}}}{\\epsilon} = 16\\pi\\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sigma^{12}r^{-10} - \\sigma^6 r^{-4} \\right) dr\n$$\nPerforming the definite integration:\n$$\n\\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sigma^{12}r^{-10} - \\sigma^6 r^{-4} \\right) dr = \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^{12}r^{-9}}{-9} - \\frac{\\sigma^6 r^{-3}}{-3} \\right]_{r_c}^{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n= \\left[ -\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r^9} + \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r^3} \\right]_{r_c}^{\\infty}\n$$\nEvaluating at the limits of integration ($r \\to \\infty$ and $r = r_c$):\n$$\n= \\left( \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\left( -\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r^9} + \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r^3} \\right) \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^9} + \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r_c^3} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= (0 + 0) - \\left( -\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^9} + \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r_c^3} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^9} - \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r_c^3}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for the reduced correction:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}_{\\mathrm{tail}}}{\\epsilon} = 16\\pi\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^9} - \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r_c^3} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form symbolic expression for the reduced tail correction as a function of $\\rho$, $\\sigma$, and $r_c$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{16\\pi\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{9r_c^9} - \\frac{\\sigma^6}{3r_c^3} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "3461858"}, {"introduction": "The Widom method provides a powerful link between the microscopic distribution of insertion energies, $\\Delta U$, and the macroscopic excess chemical potential, $\\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}$.

For $N$ independent samples, the Central Limit Theorem gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\bar{w}}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{N} = \\frac{\\langle w^2 \\rangle - \\langle w \\rangle^2}{N}\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ denotes the true ensemble average.\n\nCombining these results, and approximating the sample mean $\\bar{w}$ with the true mean $\\langle w \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{ex}}}^2 \\approx \\left(-k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\frac{1}{\\langle w \\rangle}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\langle w^2 \\rangle - \\langle w \\rangle^2}{N}\\right) = (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^2 \\frac{1}{N} \\left(\\frac{\\langle w^2 \\rangle}{\\langle w \\rangle^2} - 1\\right)\n$$\nIn dense systems where the Widom method struggles, the weights $w$ have a heavy-tailed distribution, meaning $\\langle w^2 \\rangle \\gg \\langle w \\rangle^2$. In this limit, we can approximate the variance as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{ex}}}^2 \\approx (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^2 \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{\\langle w^2 \\rangle}{\\langle w \\rangle^2}\n$$\nThe standard definition of the effective sample size, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, used to quantify the concentration of importance sampling weights is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\right)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i^2}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten in terms of sample averages:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\left(N\\bar{w}\\right)^2}{N \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum w_i^2\\right)} = N \\frac{\\bar{w}^2}{\\widehat{\\langle w^2 \\rangle}}\n$$\nwhere $\\widehat{\\langle w^2 \\rangle}$ is the sample estimate of the second moment. Rearranging gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{\\widehat{\\langle w^2 \\rangle}}{\\bar{w}^2}\n$$\nBy substituting sample estimates for the true averages in our variance expression, we find:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{ex}}}^2 \\approx (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{\\widehat{\\langle w^2 \\rangle}}{\\bar{w}^2} \\right) = (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^2 \\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nThis provides a clear interpretation: the statistical error behaves as if the estimate were derived from $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ ideal, uniformly weighted samples. The standard error is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\hat{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{ex}}} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\sqrt{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}\n$$\nThe problem requires a precision where the standard error is tighter than $0.1\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. To achieve this, we need:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\sqrt{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} \\lesssim 0.1\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}} T\n$$\nSolving for $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} \\lesssim 0.1 \\implies \\sqrt{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\gtrsim 10 \\implies N_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\gtrsim 100\n$$\nTherefore, the result should be considered unreliable if the effective sample size is less than 100. This matches option A, which provides both the correct definition of $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and the correctly derived threshold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3461886"}]}
