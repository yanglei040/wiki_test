We begin by validating the problem statement. The problem provides a well-defined physical model based on the overdamped Langevin equation, a standard and scientifically sound framework in statistical mechanics. All parameters, initial conditions, and definitions are provided and are self-consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and formalizable. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is described by the one-dimensional coordinate $z(t)$, whose dynamics are governed by the overdamped Langevin equation:\n$$\n\\gamma \\dot z(t) = -\\frac{\\partial U(z,t)}{\\partial z} + \\eta(t)\n$$\nThe total potential $U(z,t)$ is the sum of a harmonic potential and a moving harmonic trap:\n$$\nU(z,t) = \\frac{k_{0}}{2}(z-z_{*})^{2} + \\frac{k}{2}(z-z_{c}(t))^{2}\n$$\nwhere the trap center moves at a constant velocity $v$, so $z_{c}(t) = z_{0}+vt$. The term $\\eta(t)$ is Gaussian white noise with $\\langle \\eta(t)\\rangle = 0$.\n\nFirst, we derive the equation of motion for the mean trajectory $\\langle z(t) \\rangle$. We take the ensemble average of the Langevin equation. Since $\\langle \\eta(t) \\rangle = 0$ and the potential is quadratic in $z$, the averaging procedure is exact.\n$$\n\\gamma \\langle \\dot z(t) \\rangle = \\left\\langle -\\frac{\\partial U(z,t)}{\\partial z} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe force term is:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial U(z,t)}{\\partial z} = -k_{0}(z-z_{*}) - k(z-z_{c}(t)) = -(k_{0}+k)z + k_{0}z_{*} + k z_{c}(t)\n$$\nTaking the average, we get a closed, first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\mu(t) = \\langle z(t) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\gamma \\frac{d\\mu}{dt} = -(k_{0}+k)\\mu + k_{0}z_{*} + k z_{c}(t)\n$$\nLet $K = k_{0}+k$. Substituting $z_{c}(t) = z_{0}+vt$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\gamma \\frac{d\\mu}{dt} + K\\mu = k_{0}z_{*} + k z_{0} + kvt\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the initial condition for $\\mu(t)$. The system is in thermal equilibrium at $t=0$ with the trap center at $z_{c}(0)=z_{0}$. In equilibrium, the mean force is zero, so $\\langle -\\frac{\\partial U(z,0)}{\\partial z} \\rangle = 0$.\n$$\n-k_{0}(\\mu(0)-z_{*}) - k(\\mu(0)-z_{0}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-K\\mu(0) + k_{0}z_{*} + k z_{0} = 0 \\implies \\mu(0) = \\frac{k_{0}z_{*} + k z_{0}}{K}\n$$\n\nWe now solve the differential equation for $\\mu(t)$. The equation is of the form $\\dot{\\mu} + \\frac{K}{\\gamma}\\mu = f(t)$.

Let's calculate the difference $\\langle z(t) \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle_{\\text{eq}}$:\n$$\n\\langle z \\rangle_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{k_{0}z_{*} + k z_c(t)}{K} = \\frac{k_{0}z_{*} + k(z_0+vt)}{K} = \\frac{k_0 z_* + kz_0}{K} + \\frac{kv}{K}t\n$$\nSubtracting this from the solution for $\\langle z(t) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle z(t) \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle_{\\text{eq}} = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma k v}{K^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{K}{\\gamma}t\\right) + \\frac{kv}{K}t + \\frac{k_{0}z_{*} + k z_{0}}{K} - \\frac{\\gamma k v}{K^2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{k_0 z_* + kz_0}{K} + \\frac{kv}{K}t\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle z(t) \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{\\gamma k v}{K^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{K}{\\gamma}t\\right) - \\frac{\\gamma k v}{K^2}\n$$\nThis represents the lag of the system's mean position behind the moving equilibrium position.\nThe instantaneous dissipated power is then:\n$$\n\\langle \\dot W(t) \\rangle - \\frac{dF}{dt} = -kv \\left( \\frac{\\gamma k v}{K^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{K}{\\gamma}t\\right) - \\frac{\\gamma k v}{K^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\gamma k^2 v^2}{K^2} - \\frac{\\gamma k^2 v^2}{K^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{K}{\\gamma}t\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we take the limit as $t \\to \\infty$ to find the asymptotic dissipated power:\n$$\n\\langle \\dot W_{\\text{diss}} \\rangle = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma k^2 v^2}{K^2} - \\frac{\\gamma k^2 v^2}{K^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{K}{\\gamma}t\\right) \\right)\n$$\nSince $K=k_0+k0$ and $\\gamma0$, the exponential term decays to zero.\n$$\n\\langle \\dot W_{\\text{diss}} \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma k^2 v^2}{K^2}\n$$\nSubstituting $K = k_0+k$ gives the final expression in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$\n\\langle \\dot W_{\\text{diss}} \\rangle = \\frac{\\gamma k^2 v^2}{(k_0+k)^2}\n$$\nThis result represents the constant rate at which energy is dissipated as heat into the environment in the non-equilibrium steady state achieved under constant-velocity pulling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\gamma k^{2} v^{2}}{(k_{0}+k)^{2}}}$$", "id": "3449590"}, {"introduction": "A key aspect of any scientific experiment, computational or otherwise, is proper design to ensure the results are statistically meaningful.

It is a standard, albeit non-trivial, exercise in statistical error analysis applied to molecular simulations.

The estimator for $\\Delta G$ is given by\n$$\n\\widehat{\\Delta G}_{N} = -\\beta^{-1} \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\exp(-\\beta W_{i}) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $W_i$ are i.i.d. random variables drawn from a Gaussian distribution $W \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{W}, \\sigma_{W}^{2})$. Let us define a new random variable $Y_i = \\exp(-\\beta W_i)$. The estimator can then be written as $\\widehat{\\Delta G}_{N} = -\\beta^{-1} \\ln(\\bar{Y}_N)$, where $\\bar{Y}_N = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i$ is the sample mean of the $Y_i$.\n\nThe Jarzynski equality states $\\Delta G = -\\beta^{-1} \\ln(\\langle Y \\rangle)$, where $\\langle Y \\rangle = \\mu_Y$ is the true population mean of $Y$. To find the statistical properties of $\\widehat{\\Delta G}_{N}$, we first analyze the distribution of $\\bar{Y}_N$. By the Central Limit Theorem, for a sufficiently large sample size $N$, the distribution of the sample mean $\\bar{Y}_N$ is approximately Gaussian:\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_N \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_Y, \\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{N}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_Y = \\langle Y \\rangle$ and $\\sigma_Y^2 = \\text{Var}(Y) = \\langle Y^2 \\rangle - \\mu_Y^2$.\n\nWe must compute $\\mu_Y$ and $\\sigma_Y^2$. Since $W \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_W, \\sigma_W^2)$, the variable $X = -\\beta W$ is also normally distributed with mean $\\mu_X = -\\beta \\mu_W$ and variance $\\sigma_X^2 = \\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2$. The variable $Y = \\exp(X)$ thus follows a log-normal distribution. The moments of $Y$ can be calculated using the moment-generating function of the normal distribution.\nThe $k$-th moment of $Y$ is:\n$$\n\\langle Y^k \\rangle = \\langle \\exp(kX) \\rangle = \\exp(k \\mu_X + \\frac{1}{2} k^2 \\sigma_X^2)\n$$\nSo, for $k=1$:\n$$\n\\mu_Y = \\langle Y \\rangle = \\exp(\\mu_X + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_X^2) = \\exp(-\\beta \\mu_W + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2)\n$$\nAnd for $k=2$:\n$$\n\\langle Y^2 \\rangle = \\exp(2\\mu_X + \\frac{1}{2}(2^2)\\sigma_X^2) = \\exp(-2\\beta \\mu_W + 2\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2)\n$$\nThe variance of $Y$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_Y^2 = \\langle Y^2 \\rangle - \\mu_Y^2 = \\exp(-2\\beta \\mu_W + 2\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2) - \\left(\\exp(-\\beta \\mu_W + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2)\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_Y^2 = \\exp(-2\\beta \\mu_W + 2\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2) - \\exp(-2\\beta \\mu_W + \\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\mu_Y^2 = \\exp(-2\\beta \\mu_W + \\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2)$, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_Y^2 = \\exp(-2\\beta \\mu_W + \\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2) \\left(\\exp(\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2) - 1\\right) = \\mu_Y^2 \\left(\\exp(\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2) - 1\\right)\n$$\nNow we relate the variance of $\\bar{Y}_N$ to the variance of the estimator $\\widehat{\\Delta G}_{N}$ using the delta method. For a function $f(x)$, the variance of $f(X)$ is approximated by $\\text{Var}(f(X)) \\approx [f'(\\mu_X)]^2 \\text{Var}(X)$. Here, our random variable is $\\bar{Y}_N$ and the function is $f(y) = -\\beta^{-1} \\ln(y)$. The derivative is $f'(y) = -1/(\\beta y)$. We evaluate this at the mean of $\\bar{Y}_N$, which is $\\mu_Y$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\widehat{\\Delta G}_{N}) \\approx \\left[f'(\\mu_Y)\\right]^2 \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_N) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\beta \\mu_Y}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{N}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{\\beta^2 \\mu_Y^2 N}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_Y^2$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\widehat{\\Delta G}_{N}) \\approx \\frac{\\mu_Y^2 (\\exp(\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2) - 1)}{\\beta^2 \\mu_Y^2 N} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2) - 1}{\\beta^2 N}\n$$\nThis expression for the variance of the estimator remarkably depends only on the variance of the work distribution, $\\sigma_W^2$, and not its mean, $\\mu_W$.
