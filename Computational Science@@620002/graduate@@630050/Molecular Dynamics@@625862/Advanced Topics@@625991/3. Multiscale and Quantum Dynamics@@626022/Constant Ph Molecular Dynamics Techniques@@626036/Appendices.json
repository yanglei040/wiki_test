In a constant potential of hydrogen (pH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, proton exchange with a reservoir is modeled using the semi-grand canonical (SGC) ensemble, in which the appropriate thermodynamic potential for a state that differs by the number of bound protons is the semi-grand potential.

The derivation will proceed in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the semi-grand potential difference $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}$**\n\nThe system consists of a solute with a single titratable site, which can exist in a protonated state, $\\mathrm{AH}$, or a deprotonated state, $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$. The simulation is performed in the semi-grand canonical (SGC) ensemble at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, where the system can exchange protons with a reservoir at a fixed chemical potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$.\n\nThe thermodynamic potential for a state $i$ in this ensemble is the semi-grand potential, $G_{\\mathrm{sg},i}$, defined as:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{sg},i} = G_i - N_i \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$$\nwhere $G_i$ is the Gibbs free energy of the system in state $i$, and $N_i$ is the number of protons bound to the titratable site in that state.\n\nLet's define the two states of the system:\n1.  The protonated state, $\\mathrm{AH}$. The Gibbs free energy of the system with the solute in this state is $G_{\\mathrm{AH}}$. The number of bound protons is $N_{\\mathrm{AH}} = 1$.\n2.  The deprotonated state, $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$. The Gibbs free energy of the system with the solute in this state is $G_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}$. The number of bound protons is $N_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} = 0$.\n\nThe semi-grand potentials for these two states are:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{AH}) = G_{\\mathrm{AH}} - (1) \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = G_{\\mathrm{AH}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$$\n$$G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{A}^{-}) = G_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} - (0) \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = G_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the semi-grand potential difference $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}$ between the deprotonated state $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ and the protonated state $\\mathrm{AH}$:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}} = G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{A}^{-}) - G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{AH}) = G_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} - (G_{\\mathrm{AH}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) = (G_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} - G_{\\mathrm{AH}}) + \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$$\n\nThe term $(G_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} - G_{\\mathrm{AH}})$ represents the intrinsic Gibbs free energy change of deprotonating the site within the solution, which we can denote as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{deprot, intrinsic}}$. Thus,\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{deprot, intrinsic}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$$\n\nNext, we must relate $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{deprot, intrinsic}}$ to the standard deprotonation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$. The problem states that $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is the reaction free energy for $\\mathrm{AH} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}^{-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$ at unit hydrogen activity ($a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 1$). The reaction free energy under any condition is the sum of the free energies of the products minus the reactants. For this heterogeneous reaction (solute deprotonates, proton enters the reservoir), this is precisely $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}$.\n\nA more formal approach is to define $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ based on the standard chemical potentials. The reaction free energy is:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{AH}}$$\nThe standard free energy change $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}^{\\circ} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ}) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{AH}}^{\\circ}$$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ denotes the standard chemical potential. The intrinsic free energy difference $(G_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} - G_{\\mathrm{AH}})$ corresponds to the difference in standard chemical potentials of the two solute forms, $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{AH}}^{\\circ})$.\nFrom the definition of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, we can write:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{AH}}^{\\circ} = \\Delta G^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ}$$\nSo, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{deprot, intrinsic}} = G_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} - G_{\\mathrm{AH}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}$:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}} = (\\Delta G^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ}) + \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + (\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ})$$\nThe problem provides the expression for the proton chemical potential in the reservoir:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ} + R T \\ln a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$$\nTherefore, the difference $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\\circ})$ is $R T \\ln a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$.\nSubstituting this gives:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + R T \\ln a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$$\nWe are given that $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$. Using the property of logarithms $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln x$:\n$$\\ln a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = \\ln(10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}) = -\\mathrm{pH} \\ln 10$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}$ yields the final result for Part 1:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ} - R T \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\ln 10$$\nUsing the molar inverse thermal energy $\\beta \\equiv \\frac{1}{R T}$, this can be written as:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ} - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\mathrm{pH} \\ln 10$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the probability ratio $\\frac{P(\\mathrm{A}^{-})}{P(\\mathrm{AH})}$**\n\nIn the SGC ensemble, the probability $P_i$ of a system being in a state $i$ with semi-grand potential $G_{\\mathrm{sg},i}$ is given by the Boltzmann weight:\n$$P_i \\propto \\exp(-\\beta G_{\\mathrm{sg},i})$$\nwhere $\\beta = \\frac{1}{R T}$ is the molar inverse thermal energy.\n\nThe probabilities of the deprotonated and protonated states are:\n$$P(\\mathrm{A}^{-}) \\propto \\exp(-\\beta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{A}^{-}))$$\n$$P(\\mathrm{AH}) \\propto \\exp(-\\beta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{AH}))$$\n\nThe ratio of these probabilities is:\n$$\\frac{P(\\mathrm{A}^{-})}{P(\\mathrm{AH})} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{A}^{-}))}{\\exp(-\\beta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{AH}))} = \\exp[-\\beta (G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{A}^{-}) - G_{\\mathrm{sg}}(\\mathrm{AH}))]$$\nThe term in the exponent is the semi-grand potential difference, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}$, derived in Part 1.\n$$\\frac{P(\\mathrm{A}^{-})}{P(\\mathrm{AH})} = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{sg}}$:\n$$\\frac{P(\\mathrm{A}^{-})}{P(\\mathrm{AH})} = \\exp(-\\beta (\\Delta G^{\\circ} - R T \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\ln 10))$$\nExpanding the exponent:\n$$\\frac{P(\\mathrm{A}^{-})}{P(\\mathrm{AH})} = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G^{\\circ} + \\beta R T \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\ln 10)$$\nSince $\\beta R T = (\\frac{1}{R T}) R T = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{P(\\mathrm{A}^{-})}{P(\\mathrm{AH})} = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G^{\\circ} + \\mathrm{pH} \\ln 10)$$\nThis expression gives the probability ratio as a function of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ and $\\mathrm{pH}$, as required.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the probability ratio for the following specific case:\n- $T = 298.15 \\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.000$\n- $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = 6.000\\, R T \\ln 10$\n\nWe use the formula derived in Part 2:\n$$\\frac{P(\\mathrm{A}^{-})}{P(\\mathrm{AH})} = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G^{\\circ} + \\mathrm{pH} \\ln 10)$$\nFirst, let's evaluate the term $-\\beta \\Delta G^{\\circ}$:\n$$-\\beta \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -\\frac{1}{R T} (6.000\\, R T \\ln 10) = -6.000 \\ln 10$$\nNow, substitute this and the value for $\\mathrm{pH}$ into the exponent:\n$$\\text{Exponent} = -6.000 \\ln 10 + 7.000 \\ln 10$$\n$$\\text{Exponent} = (7.000 - 6.000) \\ln 10 = 1.000 \\ln 10$$\nNow we compute the ratio:\n$$\\frac{P(\\mathrm{A}^{-})}{P(\\mathrm{AH})} = \\exp(1.000 \\ln 10) = \\exp(\\ln(10^{1.000})) = 10^{1.000} = 10.00$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. A value of $10.00$ has four significant figures. Rounding this to three significant figures gives $10.0$.\nThis result is consistent with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The given $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ corresponds to a $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ value, since $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -R T \\ln K_a = R T \\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{p}K_a$.

Model each observation at acidity value $pH_i$ as $y_i$ protonated counts out of $N_i$ trials, with $y_i$ distributed as a binomial random variable with success probability $p_i$. For an acid-type site, the protonated fraction is given by the equilibrium occupancy\n$$\np_i = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\,pH_i - pK_a}},\n$$\nwhere $pK_a$ is the acid dissociation constant on the logarithmic scale. Assume observations at different $pH_i$ are independent given $pK_a$.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using the binomial likelihood and the independence assumption, determine the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) $\\widehat{pK_a}$ by maximizing the log-likelihood with respect to $pK_a$ based on the provided data.\n2. Construct a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $pK_a$ via a profile likelihood method. Specifically, define the negative log-likelihood $-\\ell(pK_a)$ up to an additive constant and find the set of $pK_a$ values that satisfy\n$$\n2\\left(\\ell(\\widehat{pK_a}) - \\ell(pK_a)\\right) \\le \\chi^2_{1,0.95},\n$$\nwhere $\\chi^2_{1,0.95}$ is the $0.95$ quantile of the chi-square distribution with $1$ degree of freedom. If the interval extends beyond physically plausible acidity constants, truncate to the range $[0, 14]$.\n3. Assess overdispersion by computing the Pearson dispersion statistic\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{1}{K - 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\frac{\\left(y_i - N_i \\widehat{p}_i\\right)^2}{N_i \\widehat{p}_i \\left(1 - \\widehat{p}_i\\right)},\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the number of acidity points, and $\\widehat{p}_i$ is the fitted protonated probability at $pH_i$ using $\\widehat{pK_a}$. Under the binomial model, the Pearson chi-square statistic\n$$\nX^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\frac{\\left(y_i - N_i \\widehat{p}_i\\right)^2}{N_i \\widehat{p}_i \\left(1 - \\widehat{p}_i\\right)}\n$$\nis approximately $\\chi^2$ distributed with $K - 1$ degrees of freedom. Use this to compute a $p$-value. Declare the data overdispersed if $\\phi &gt; 1$ and the $p$-value is below a significance level $\\alpha = 0.01$. Interpret overdispersion as suggestive of time-correlation or hidden substates beyond the single-site model.\n\nYour program must implement this estimation and diagnostic for the following test suite of cases. Each case provides $pH$ values, total counts $N_i$, and protonated counts $y_i$:\n\n- Case A (well-behaved binomial sampling, moderate sizes):\n  - $pH$: $[4.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0]$\n  - $N$: $[500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500]$\n  - $y$: $[498, 455, 374, 250, 125, 12, 1]$\n\n- Case B (apparent overdispersion at most $pH$ values):\n  - $pH$: $[4.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0]$\n  - $N$: $[500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500]$\n  - $y$: $[485, 420, 340, 280, 160, 30, 6]$\n\n- Case C (edge-heavy sampling with small sizes):\n  - $pH$: $[3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 9.0, 10.0]$\n  - $N$: $[50, 50, 50, 50, 50]$\n  - $y$: $[50, 49, 25, 2, 0]$\n\n- Case D (hidden-state-like shape suggestive of mixtures):\n  - $pH$: $[5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0]$\n  - $N$: $[400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400, 400]$\n  - $y$: $[372, 352, 300, 170, 140, 70, 45]$\n\nRequirements:\n- For each case, compute and report a list of four items: $\\widehat{pK_a}$, the lower confidence limit, the upper confidence limit, and a boolean overdispersion flag. Round all three $pK_a$-related numbers to $3$ decimals. The boolean must be reported as a language-native boolean.\n- The final output must be a single line containing a list of results, one per case, where each case’s result is itself a list in the order described above. The line must be formatted as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets with no spaces, for example: $[[x_1,y_1,z_1,b_1],[x_2,y_2,z_2,b_2],\\dots]$.\n- All acidity values and $pK_a$ values are dimensionless, so no units are required. Use the physical plausibility range $[0, 14]$ for $pK_a$ throughout the computation.", "solution": "We model each observation as follows. For each acidity point $pH_i$, the protonation state indicator $X_{ij}$ for trial $j$ is a Bernoulli random variable with success probability $p_i$, independent across $j$ and $i$ given $pK_a$. The binomial count at that point is $Y_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} X_{ij}$, so $Y_i \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, p_i)$. For an acid-type site at equilibrium, the protonated fraction is\n$$\np_i = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\,pH_i - pK_a}},\n$$\nwhich follows from the law of mass action and the definition of the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation. The independence assumption implies the joint likelihood across $K$ acidity values is\n$$\nL(pK_a) = \\prod_{i=1}^{K} \\binom{N_i}{y_i} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{N_i - y_i}.\n$$\nThe corresponding log-likelihood is\n$$\n\\ell(pK_a) = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\left[ \\log \\binom{N_i}{y_i} + y_i \\log p_i + (N_i - y_i) \\log(1 - p_i) \\right].\n$$\nThe combinatorial terms do not depend on $pK_a$, so maximizing $\\ell(pK_a)$ is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood without those constants:\n$$\n-\\tilde{\\ell}(pK_a) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\left[ y_i \\log p_i + (N_i - y_i) \\log(1 - p_i) \\right].\n$$\nWe compute the maximum likelihood estimate $\\widehat{pK_a}$ by minimizing $-\\tilde{\\ell}(pK_a)$ over the physically plausible range $[0, 14]$. Numerically, we evaluate $p_i$ from $pK_a$ using $p_i = 1/(1 + 10^{\\,pH_i - pK_a})$, clip $p_i$ to $[10^{-12}, 1 - 10^{-12}]$ to avoid logarithm of zero, and use a bounded one-dimensional optimizer.\n\nFor the confidence interval, we invoke the asymptotic profile likelihood result: under regularity conditions, the likelihood ratio statistic\n$$\n\\Lambda(pK_a) = 2\\left(\\ell(\\widehat{pK_a}) - \\ell(pK_a)\\right)\n$$\nconverges in distribution to a chi-square distribution with $1$ degree of freedom. Thus the $95\\%$ profile likelihood confidence set is all $pK_a$ such that\n$$\n\\Lambda(pK_a) \\le \\chi^2_{1, 0.95}.\n$$\nIn terms of negative log-likelihood, this is equivalent to\n$$\n-\\tilde{\\ell}(pK_a) \\le -\\tilde{\\ell}(\\widehat{pK_a}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{1, 0.95}.\n$$\nWe compute the threshold $-\\tilde{\\ell}(\\widehat{pK_a}) + \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{1,0.95}$ and then numerically find the left and right intersection points of $-\\tilde{\\ell}(pK_a)$ with this level. We first scan a grid over $[0, 14]$ to bracket the crossings and then use a root finder locally to refine each bound. If a crossing is not found on one side within $[0, 14]$, we truncate that bound to $0$ or $14$ accordingly.\n\nTo assess overdispersion, we use the Pearson chi-square statistic at the MLE:\n$$\nX^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\frac{\\left(y_i - N_i \\widehat{p}_i\\right)^2}{N_i \\widehat{p}_i \\left(1 - \\widehat{p}_i\\right)},\n$$\nwhere $\\widehat{p}_i = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\,pH_i - \\widehat{pK_a}}}$. Under the binomial model with one fitted parameter $pK_a$, $X^2$ is approximately chi-square distributed with $K - 1$ degrees of freedom. The dispersion estimate is\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{X^2}{K - 1}.\n$$\nWe compute the $p$-value from the chi-square survival function, and then declare overdispersion if $\\phi > 1$ and the $p$-value is below $\\alpha = 0.01$. Such overdispersion can arise from time-correlation in the samples or hidden substates that violate the single-site, independently sampled binomial assumptions, which are precisely the phenomena of interest in constant pH molecular dynamics when dynamics are slow or multiple microstates contribute.\n\nAlgorithmic steps implemented in the program for each case:\n1. Parse arrays $\\{pH_i\\}_{i=1}^{K}$, $\\{N_i\\}_{i=1}^{K}$, $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{K}$.\n2. Compute $\\widehat{pK_a}$ by minimizing $-\\tilde{\\ell}(pK_a)$ over $[0, 14]$ with a bounded optimizer.\n3. Compute the profile likelihood threshold using $\\chi^2_{1, 0.95}$, bracket crossings on a grid, and refine with a root finder to obtain the lower and upper bounds; truncate to $[0, 14]$ as needed.\n4. Compute $\\phi$ and the chi-square $p$-value with $K - 1$ degrees of freedom; set the overdispersion flag using $\\alpha = 0.01$.\n5. Round $\\widehat{pK_a}$ and both bounds to $3$ decimals and return a list $[\\widehat{pK_a}, \\mathrm{lower}, \\mathrm{upper}, \\mathrm{flag}]$.\n\nThe program aggregates the four case results into a single list and prints it on one line in the specified format with no spaces.", "answer": "[[6.502,6.435,6.571,False],[6.536,6.398,6.677,True],[6.000,5.714,6.309,False],[6.702,6.586,6.825,True]]", "id": "3404590"}]}
