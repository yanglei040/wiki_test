[@problem_id:3453034]", "problem": "A small amphiphile such as ethanol must be represented in a coarse-grained force field in a way that preserves its dominant chemical functionalities. In the MARTINI coarse-grained force field, groups of atoms are merged into interaction sites called beads. Typical mapping rules lump approximately $2$–$4$ heavy atoms into one bead and assign bead types to encode polarity, hydrogen-bonding capability, and apolar character, thereby controlling the effective nonbonded interaction strengths. The octanol–water partition coefficient, denoted $K_{\\mathrm{ow}}$, is defined as $K_{\\mathrm{ow}} = c_{\\mathrm{o}}/c_{\\mathrm{w}}$ at equilibrium, where $c_{\\mathrm{o}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{w}}$ are the solute concentrations in $n$-octanol and water phases, respectively. The thermodynamic free energy of transfer from water to octanol is related to $K_{\\mathrm{ow}}$ by $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{w}\\to \\mathrm{o}} = - R T \\ln K_{\\mathrm{ow}}$, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is temperature.

Option C is chemically nonsensical, assigning the polar hydroxyl-containing group to an apolar bead, which would incorrectly predict poor water solubility.\n*   **Option D is incorrect.** It wrongly assigns a full charge (Q bead type) to the neutral hydroxyl group, which would model an ionic species, not ethanol.\n*   **Option A is correct.** It proposes a two-bead model: one apolar bead (class C) for the terminal $\\text{CH}_3$ group and one polar, hydrogen-bonding bead (class P) for the $\\text{CH}_2\\text{-}\\text{OH}$ group.

The number of internal degrees of freedom increases, and the configurational entropy available at the coarse-grained level increases.

It poses a standard question in coarse-grained modeling concerning the re-parameterization of a polymer model to preserve macroscopic properties across different levels of resolution. All provided data and assumptions are physically reasonable and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nWe will analyze the problem in three parts: the change in internal degrees of freedom and entropy, the adjustment of the angular force constant $k_\\theta$, and the adjustment of the bond force constant $k_r$.\n\n**1. Internal Degrees of Freedom and Configurational Entropy**\n\nA coarse-grained chain of $N$ beads, existing as a non-linear object in three-dimensional space, has $3N$ total degrees of freedom. Of these, $3$ are for rigid translation and $3$ are for rigid rotation of the entire chain. The number of internal degrees of freedom, which describe the conformation, is therefore $3N-6$.\n\nFor the $4{:}1$ model, $N_4 = 12$. The number of internal degrees of freedom is $3N_4 - 6 = 3(12) - 6 = 30$.\nFor the $3{:}1$ model, $N_3 = 16$. The number of internal degrees of freedom is $3N_3 - 6 = 3(16) - 6 = 42$.\n\nMoving from the $4{:}1$ mapping to the finer $3{:}1$ mapping increases the number of beads representing the same chemical fragment. This increases the number of internal degrees of freedom.\n\nConfigurational entropy, $S_{conf}$, is related to the volume of the accessible conformational phase space. By increasing the number of beads and thus the number of internal coordinates, the dimensionality of the conformational space increases. This represents a more detailed description of the system's configuration, leading to a larger number of possible microstates for the coarse-grained model. Consequently, the configurational entropy available at the coarse-grained level increases.\n\n**2. Angular Force Constant ($k_\\theta$) and Persistence Length ($l_p$)**\n\nThe persistence length, $l_p$, is related to the chain's bending rigidity, $\\kappa$, by the formula $l_p = \\kappa / (k_B T)$ for a chain in three dimensions. Here, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nTo relate the macroscopic rigidity $\\kappa$ to the microscopic angle potential $U_\\theta = \\tfrac{1}{2}k_\\theta (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2$, we can map the energy of a bent discrete segment to its continuous counterpart. The bending energy of a continuous rod segment of length $r_0$ with curvature $C$ is approximately $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa C^2 r_0$. For a discrete chain with small deviations from being straight ($\\theta_0=\\pi$), the curvature can be approximated as $C \\approx (\\pi - \\theta)/r_0$. The energy stored in one angle is then $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa ((\\pi - \\theta)/r_0)^2 r_0 = \\tfrac{\\kappa}{2r_0}(\\theta - \\pi)^2$. Comparing this to the given harmonic potential $U_\\theta = \\tfrac{1}{2}k_\\theta (\\theta - \\pi)^2$, we identify the relationship $\\kappa = k_\\theta r_0$.\n\nSubstituting this into the persistence length formula gives $l_p = (k_\\theta r_0) / (k_B T)$. To keep $l_p$ constant at a fixed temperature, the product $k_\\theta r_0$ must be constant. This implies that the angular force constant $k_\\theta$ must be inversely proportional to the equilibrium bond length $r_0$:\n$$k_\\theta \\propto \\frac{1}{r_0}$$\nThe problem states the beads are arranged linearly to span the contour length $L=4.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The equilibrium bond length $r_0$ is the length of a segment.\nFor the $4{:}1$ model with $N_4=12$ beads, there are $N_4-1 = 11$ bonds. So, $r_0^{(4:1)} = L/(N_4-1) = 4.8/11\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nFor the $3{:}1$ model with $N_3=16$ beads, there are $N_3-1 = 15$ bonds. So, $r_0^{(3:1)} = L/(N_3-1) = 4.8/15\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe numerical values in the options suggest using the common approximation for long chains where the number of segments is approximated by the number of beads, $N$. With this approximation, $r_0 \\approx L/N$. This implies $k_\\theta \\propto N$. Let's verify this.\nIf $r_0 \\approx L/N_4 = 4.8/12 = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, we can calculate the expected $k_\\theta^{(4:1)}$:\n$k_B T = R T = (8.314 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2.494\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$k_\\theta^{(4:1)} = \\frac{l_p k_B T}{r_0^{(4:1)}} = \\frac{(1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm})(2.494\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}})}{0.4\\,\\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 9.35\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,rad^{-2}}$$\nThis matches the value in option A exactly. Now we find the required constant for the $3{:}1$ model. The segment length is $r_0^{(3:1)} \\approx L/N_3 = 4.8/16 = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$k_\\theta^{(3:1)} = \\frac{l_p k_B T}{r_0^{(3:1)}} = \\frac{(1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm})(2.494\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}})}{0.3\\,\\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 12.47\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,rad^{-2}}$$\nThis also matches option A. The per-angle force constant must increase.\n\n**3. Bond Force Constant ($k_r$) and Relative Fluctuations**\n\nThe target is to keep the relative bond-length fluctuations, $\\langle (\\delta r)^2 \\rangle / r_0^2$, invariant across the resolutions, where $\\delta r = r - r_0$. The bond potential is $U_r = \\tfrac{1}{2}k_r(\\delta r)^2$. From the equipartition theorem for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the average potential energy is $\\langle U_r \\rangle = \\tfrac{1}{2}k_B T$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} k_r \\langle (\\delta r)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\implies \\langle (\\delta r)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{k_r}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for relative fluctuations:\n$$\\frac{\\langle (\\delta r)^2 \\rangle}{r_0^2} = \\frac{k_B T}{k_r r_0^2}$$\nTo keep this quantity constant at a fixed temperature, the product $k_r r_0^2$ must be constant. This means $k_r$ must be inversely proportional to the square of the bond length:\n$$k_r \\propto \\frac{1}{r_0^2}$$\nUsing the same approximation as before, $r_0 \\propto 1/N$, we find that $k_r$ must scale with the square of the number of beads: $k_r \\propto N^2$.\n\nThe initial bond constant is $k_r^{(4:1)} = 5000\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,nm^{-2}}$ for $N_4 = 12$. For the $3{:}1$ model with $N_3=16$, the new constant must be:\n$$k_r^{(3:1)} = k_r^{(4:1)} \\left( \\frac{r_0^{(4:1)}}{r_0^{(3:1)}} \\right)^2 = k_r^{(4:1)} \\left( \\frac{L/N_4}{L/N_3} \\right)^2 = k_r^{(4:1)} \\left( \\frac{N_3}{N_4} \\right)^2$$\n$$k_r^{(3:1)} = (5000\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,nm^{-2}}) \\left( \\frac{16}{12} \\right)^2 = 5000 \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right)^2 = 5000 \\times \\frac{16}{9} \\approx 8889\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,nm^{-2}}$$\nThis calculation matches the value proposed in option A.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A.** States that internal degrees of freedom and configurational entropy increase. Correct. States that $k_\\theta$ must increase from $\\approx 9.35$ to $\\approx 12.47\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,rad^{-2}}$. Correct.

The relationship is given as $t_{\\mathrm{AT}} = s_t \\, t_{\\mathrm{CG}}$. This mapping is essential because the smoothed interactions and reduced degrees of freedom in CG models, such as MARTINI, typically accelerate the system's dynamics relative to physical reality.\n\nThe derivation begins with the Einstein–Smoluchowski relation, which describes the diffusive motion of a particle. In three spatial dimensions ($d=3$), the mean squared displacement (MSD) of a particle is linearly proportional to the time interval $t$ and the diffusion coefficient $D$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = \\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle = 6Dt\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is the position vector of the particle at time $t$, and the angle brackets $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denote an ensemble average.\n\nThis relationship holds for both the atomistic and coarse-grained representations. Let's denote the diffusion coefficient and time in the atomistic simulation as $D_{\\mathrm{AT}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{AT}}$, respectively.

This means we must equate the MSD of the solute in the atomistic representation over a physical time $t_{\\mathrm{AT}}$ with the MSD of the solute in the coarse-grained representation over its corresponding simulation time $t_{\\mathrm{CG}}$. This enforces that the long-time diffusive behavior is conserved between the two levels of theory.\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{AT}}(t_{\\mathrm{AT}}) = \\mathrm{MSD}_{\\mathrm{CG}}(t_{\\mathrm{CG}})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the MSD, we obtain:\n$$\n6 D_{\\mathrm{AT}} t_{\\mathrm{AT}} = 6 D_{\\mathrm{CG}} t_{\\mathrm{CG}}\n$$\nThe factor of $6$ cancels out, leading to a direct relationship between the time and diffusion coefficients:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{AT}} t_{\\mathrm{AT}} = D_{\\mathrm{CG}} t_{\\mathrm{CG}}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{AT}}$ gives the mapping from the coarse-grained time to the atomistic time:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{AT}} = \\left( \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{CG}}}{D_{\\mathrm{AT}}} \\right) t_{\\mathrm{CG}}\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the given definition $t_{\\mathrm{AT}} = s_t \\, t_{\\mathrm{CG}}$, we can identify the dimensionless time scaling factor $s_t$ as:\n$$\ns_t = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{CG}}}{D_{\\mathrm{AT}}}\n$$\nThis derived formula allows for the direct calculation of $s_t$ from experimentally or computationally measured diffusion coefficients for the same solute at the same temperature $T$.\n\nThe necessity for this time scaling arises from fundamental differences between the atomistic and coarse-grained models. The problem states the relationship between the diffusion coefficient $D$, thermal energy $k_B T$, and the effective friction coefficient $\\zeta$ as $D = k_B T / \\zeta$. Since the temperature $T$ is held constant between simulations, the ratio of diffusion coefficients is inversely proportional to the ratio of friction coefficients:\n$$\ns_t = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{CG}}}{D_{\\mathrm{AT}}} = \\frac{k_B T / \\zeta_{\\mathrm{CG}}}{k_B T / \\zeta_{\\mathrm{AT}}} = \\frac{\\zeta_{\\mathrm{AT}}}{\\zeta_{\\mathrm{CG}}}\n$$\nIn MARTINI simulations, $D_{\\mathrm{CG}}$ is typically greater than $D_{\\mathrm{AT}}$, which implies that $s_t > 1$. This, in turn, means that the effective friction experienced by a solute in the CG model, $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{CG}}$, is lower than in the atomistic model, $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{AT}}$. The primary sources for this reduced friction are:\n\n1.  **Reduced Degrees of Freedom and Smoother Energy Landscape**: MARTINI averages over several atoms (typically $4$ heavy atoms) to form a single CG bead. This process eliminates the high-frequency motions of bond vibrations and angle bendings. Furthermore, the interactions between CG beads are described by softened potentials (e.g., shifted Lennard-Jones potentials) compared to the sharp potentials in atomistic force fields. This creates a much smoother potential energy surface. Friction, at a molecular level, arises from the resistance a particle feels as it moves through a \"bumpy\" energy landscape created by its neighbors. A smoother landscape offers lower energy barriers to motion, resulting in less resistance and thus a lower effective friction coefficient $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{CG}}$.\n\n2.  **Reduced Solvent Friction and Altered Hydrodynamics**: A significant contribution to friction comes from collisions with solvent molecules. In the MARTINI model, the solvent (e.g., water) is also coarse-grained, with one CG bead representing four water molecules. This drastic reduction in the number of solvent particles leads to fewer solute-solvent collisions per unit time, directly lowering the collisional component of friction. This simplification also alters the collective solvent behavior, leading to a much lower viscosity for the CG solvent compared to real water. Lower viscosity implies reduced hydrodynamic drag, further contributing to $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{CG}}  \\zeta_{\\mathrm{AT}}$.\n\nIn summary, the artificially fast dynamics in MARTINI ($D_{\\mathrm{CG}} > D_{\\mathrm{AT}}$) are a direct consequence of the smoother energy surfaces and reduced friction inherent in the coarse-graining procedure. The time scaling factor $s_t$ serves as a crucial correction to map the accelerated simulation time back to a physically meaningful timescale.\n\nThe program below will compute $s_t = D_{\\mathrm{CG}} / D_{\\mathrm{AT}}$ for the provided test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimensionless time scaling factor s_t for coarse-grained simulations\n    based on atomistic and coarse-grained diffusion coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains (D_AT, D_CG) in nm^2/ns.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.25, 1.00),  # Case 1\n        (0.05, 0.15),  # Case 2\n        (0.01, 0.012), # Case 3\n        (0.20, 0.20),  # Case 4\n        (0.30, 0.24),  # Case 5\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for D_AT, D_CG in test_cases:\n        # The derivation shows that the time scaling factor s_t is the ratio\n        # of the coarse-grained diffusion coefficient to the atomistic one.\n        # s_t = D_CG / D_AT\n        \n        # Ensure D_AT is not zero to prevent division by zero errors,\n        # which is a physically sound check.\n        if D_AT == 0:\n            # A zero atomistic diffusion coefficient is physically unrealistic\n            # for a diffusing solute and would imply an infinite scaling factor.\n            # We can represent this as NaN or handle it as an error.\n            # For this problem, we assume D_AT > 0.\n            s_t = np.nan\n        else:\n            s_t = D_CG / D_AT\n        \n        results.append(s_t)\n\n    # Format the results to 6 decimal places and create the final output string.\n    # The map(lambda r: f\"{r:.6f}\", results) ensures each number is a string\n    # with the required precision.\n    output_string = f\"[{','.join(map(lambda r: f'{r:.6f}', results))}]\"\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(output_string)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3453040"}]}
