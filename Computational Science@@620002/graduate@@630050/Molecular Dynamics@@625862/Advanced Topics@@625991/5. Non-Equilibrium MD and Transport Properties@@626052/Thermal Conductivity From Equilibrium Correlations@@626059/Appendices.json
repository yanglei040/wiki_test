These relations are a direct consequence of linear response theory, which posits that the response of a system to a small external perturbation is proportional to the correlation function of the corresponding fluctuating currents in the unperturbed equilibrium state. For thermal conductivity, the relevant macroscopic law is Fourier's law of heat conduction, which relates the heat flux vector $\\mathbf{j}_q$ to the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{j}_q = -\\kappa \\nabla T\n$$\nIn statistical mechanics, the thermodynamic force that drives heat flow is not the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$ itself, but rather the gradient of the inverse temperature, $\\mathbf{X}_q = \\nabla(1/T)$.

The units of thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ are $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, which correspond to dimensions of $MLT^{-3}\\Theta^{-1}$. The dimensions of the terms on the right-hand side are: $[A] = [J_x^2]$, where $J_x$ is an extensive heat current. Heat flux $J_x/V$ has units of energy per area per time, so its dimensions are $(ML^2T^{-2}) / (L^2 T) = MT^{-3}$. Thus, $[J_x] = ML^3T^{-3}$ and $[A] = M^2 L^6 T^{-6}$. The remaining dimensions are $[\\tau] = T$, $[V] = L^3$, $[k_B] = ML^2T^{-2}\\Theta^{-1}$, and $[T_{temp}] = \\Theta$.

The parameter $A = \\langle J_x(0)^2 \\rangle$ represents the mean-square amplitude of the equilibrium heat current fluctuations. A larger value of $A$ signifies that the system naturally supports larger spontaneous flows of energy. It is physically reasonable that a system with larger intrinsic energy fluctuations is also able to sustain a larger directed heat flow under a thermal gradient, resulting in a higher thermal conductivity.\n2.  **Dependency on $\\tau$**: $\\kappa \\propto \\tau$. The parameter $\\tau$ is the characteristic decay time, or correlation time, of the heat current fluctuations. It measures how long a fluctuation persists before it decays. A longer correlation time implies that a local energy fluctuation can propagate further before being randomized by other thermal motions. This leads to more efficient long-range energy transport, and thus a higher thermal conductivity.\n3.  **Dependency on $V$**: The expression shows $\\kappa \\propto 1/V$. This appears to suggest that thermal conductivity is an extensive property, which contradicts the fact that it is an intensive material property. The resolution lies in the nature of the parameter $A$. Since $J_x$ is an extensive quantity (an integral of a local current density over the entire volume $V$), its mean-square fluctuation, $A = \\langle J_x^2 \\rangle$, is expected to scale linearly with the system volume for a large system (i.e., $A \\propto V$). Therefore, the factor of $V$ in the denominator cancels the implicit volume dependence in $A$, making $\\kappa$ an intensive property, independent of system size as it must be.\n4.  **Dependency on $T$**: The expression shows $\\kappa \\propto 1/T^2$. This inverse quadratic dependence on temperature arises directly from the Green-Kubo formalism. One factor of $1/T$ originates from relating the thermodynamic driving force $\\nabla(1/T)$ to the applied temperature gradient $\\nabla T$. The second factor of $1/T$ (as part of $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$) originates from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem itself, which connects the system's linear response to the magnitude of its thermal fluctuations. While this specific $1/T^2$ dependence is a result of the model, in real systems, the parameters $A$ and $\\tau$ are also temperature-dependent, leading to more complex overall behavior (e.g., in phonon-dominated heat transfer at high temperatures, scattering rates increase with $T$, making $\\tau$ decrease, which can lead to a $\\kappa \\propto 1/T$ dependence).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{A \\tau}{V k_{B} T^{2}}}$$", "id": "3453461"}, {"introduction": "Calculating transport coefficients from molecular dynamics simulations is fundamentally a statistical measurement, subject to uncertainty that decreases with simulation length.
