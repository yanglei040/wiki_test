By implementing a semi-analytic model, you will gain hands-on experience evaluating this stability threshold and understanding how it is modified by general relativity and thermal pressure.", "problem": "You are tasked with building a self-contained program that, for a set of hypermassive neutron star parameter sets representative of a post-merger remnant, computes the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational binding energy, correlates this ratio with the onset of the non-axisymmetric $m=2$ bar-mode instability, and evaluates the role of thermal pressure in shifting the instability threshold. You must work from first principles appropriate to continuum mechanics and gravitation, and implement a minimal, physically consistent normal-mode model to estimate the exponential growth rate.\n\nUse the following foundational base and modeling assumptions, all in the International System of Units (SI):\n\n- Rotational kinetic energy is $T = \\tfrac{1}{2} I \\Omega^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\\Omega$ is the angular frequency.\n- Total angular momentum is $J = I \\Omega$, implying $T = J^2/(2 I)$.\n- The magnitude of the gravitational binding energy is modeled as $|W| = k_W \\dfrac{G M^2}{R}$, where $G$ is Newton’s gravitational constant, $M$ is the gravitational mass, $R$ is the stellar circumferential radius, and $k_W$ is a dimensionless structural coefficient capturing the equation-of-state dependence in a Newtonian-like binding-energy estimate.\n- Adopt a moment-of-inertia model $I = k_I M R^2$, where $k_I$ is a dimensionless structural coefficient.\n- Thermal pressure provides additional pressure support beyond the cold (zero-temperature) configuration.

It presents a self-contained, physically and mathematically consistent modeling task based on established principles in astrophysics. All necessary parameters, constants, and equations are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. The model, while simplified, uses standard and plausible approximations for studying rotational instabilities in neutron stars.\n\nThe task is to compute the growth rate of the $m=2$ bar-mode instability for several hypermassive neutron star configurations. The core of the model is the comparison between the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational binding energy, denoted $\\beta$, and a critical threshold for this ratio, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. The system is unstable if $\\beta  \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the physical constants and model parameters provided:\n- Gravitational constant: $G = 6.674\\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,kg^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}$.\n- Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458\\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n- Moment of inertia structural coefficient: $k_I = 0.35$.\n- Gravitational binding energy structural coefficient: $k_W = 0.60$.\n- Thermal expansion coefficient: $\\chi = 0.30$.\n- Instability threshold model coefficients: Newtonian baseline $\\beta_N = 0.266$, compactness correction $a_C = -0.10$, and thermal correction $a_{\\mathrm{th}} = +0.05$.\n- Growth rate scaling constant: $\\sigma = 0.60$.\n\nFor each test case, defined by the set of parameters $\\{M, R_{\\mathrm{cold}}, J, f_{\\mathrm{th}}\\}$ representing gravitational mass, cold-limit radius, total angular momentum, and thermal energy fraction, respectively, we proceed through the following sequence of calculations.\n\n1.  **Thermally Expanded Radius ($R$)**: The stellar radius is affected by thermal pressure. We model this as a linear expansion from the cold radius $R_{\\mathrm{cold}}$, proportional to the thermal fraction $f_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and a coupling coefficient $\\chi$.\n    $$R = R_{\\mathrm{cold}}\\left(1 + \\chi f_{\\mathrm{th}}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **Moment of Inertia ($I$)**: Using the expanded radius $R$, we calculate the moment of inertia $I$ with a simple structural model, where $k_I$ is a dimensionless constant that depends on the star's internal density distribution.\n    $$I = k_I M R^2$$\n\n3.  **Gravitational Binding Energy ($|W|$)**: The magnitude of the gravitational binding energy $|W|$ is estimated using a Newtonian-like formula, corrected by a structural factor $k_W$.\n    $$|W| = k_W \\frac{G M^2}{R}$$\n\n4.  **Rotational Kinetic Energy ($T$)**: The rotational kinetic energy $T$ is expressed in terms of the total angular momentum $J$ and the moment of inertia $I$.\n    $$T = \\frac{J^2}{2 I}$$\n\n5.  **Kinetic-to-Binding-Energy Ratio ($\\beta$)**: This dimensionless ratio is the key parameter governing dynamical instabilities. It is defined as:\n    $$\\beta = \\frac{T}{|W|}$$\n\n6.  **Compactness ($C$)**: The stellar compactness $C$ is a dimensionless measure of an object's gravitational strength, defined as the ratio of its Schwarzschild radius to its physical radius. It is used to parametrize general relativistic effects.\n    $$C = \\frac{G M}{R c^2}$$\n\n7.  **Instability Threshold ($\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$)**: The critical threshold for the bar-mode instability, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is modeled as a function of both compactness $C$ and thermal fraction $f_{\\mathrm{th}}$. It represents a first-order correction to the classical Newtonian value $\\beta_N$. General relativistic effects, captured by $C$, are stabilizing ($a_C  0$), while thermal pressure, captured by $f_{\\mathrm{th}}$, is also modeled as a stabilizing influence ($a_{\\mathrm{th}} > 0$).\n    $$\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}(C, f_{\\mathrm{th}}) = \\beta_N + a_C C + a_{\\mathrm{th}} f_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n\n8.  **Instability Condition**: The star is dynamically unstable to the $m=2$ bar mode if its rotational energy ratio $\\beta$ exceeds the critical threshold $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. We define a boolean variable, $\\text{is\\_unstable}$, to be true if $\\beta  \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and false otherwise.\n\n9.  **Angular Frequency ($\\Omega$)**: The angular frequency $\\Omega$ is required for calculating the instability growth rate. It is derived from the angular momentum $J$ and moment of inertia $I$.\n    $$\\Omega = \\frac{J}{I}$$\n\n10. **Instability Growth Rate ($\\gamma$)**: If the star is unstable ($\\beta  \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$), the amplitude of the bar-mode deformation grows exponentially with a rate $\\gamma$. This growth rate is modeled to be proportional to the star's rotation rate $\\Omega$ and the square root of the fractional amount by which $\\beta$ exceeds $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. If the star is stable, the growth rate is zero.\n    $$\\gamma = \\begin{cases} \\sigma\\, \\Omega\\, \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\beta}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}} - 1}  \\text{if } \\beta  \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } \\beta \\le \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\end{cases}$$\n\nBy applying these ten steps to each test case, we can determine its stability properties and compute the required output vector $[\\beta, \\beta_{\\mathrm{crit}}, \\text{is\\_unstable}, \\gamma]$.

You may assume that the Einstein field equations and general relativistic hydrodynamics are covariant and respect the same continuous and discrete symmetries as the initial data and boundary conditions. You may also assume that the numerical algorithm correctly enforces the imposed discrete symmetry to within truncation error.\n\nWhich of the following options are consistent with this first-principles reasoning and constitute a valid and scientifically sound experimental design to detect artificially suppressed $m=1$ dynamics?\n\nA. Imposing $\\pi$-symmetry enforces $f(t,r,\\phi,z)=f(t,r,\\phi+\\pi,z)$ for all evolved fields $f$. For a Fourier component $e^{i m \\phi}$ this implies $e^{i m (\\phi+\\pi)}=(-1)^m e^{i m \\phi}$, so invariance requires vanishing amplitudes for all odd $m$. Therefore, any physical $m=1$ instability in the matter or metric sector is forbidden by construction. A clean numerical experiment is to perform two otherwise identical simulations, one in a full $2\\pi$ azimuthal domain and one with $\\pi$-symmetry, with identical initial data and identical small random or deterministic seed perturbations. One then tracks the time evolution of the normalized density mode $C_1(t)=\\left|\\int \\rho(t,\\mathbf{x})\\,e^{i\\,1\\,\\phi}\\,d^3x\\right|/ \\int \\rho(t,\\mathbf{x})\\,d^3x$ and the radiation modes $h_{\\ell\\,1}(t)$ or $\\Psi_4^{\\ell\\,1}(t)$ to measure a growth rate $\\gamma_1$ via $C_1(t)\\propto e^{\\gamma_1 t}$ in the full-domain run and its absence in the $\\pi$-symmetric run.\n\nB. The $\\pi$-symmetry constraint only restricts gauge degrees of freedom and does not affect physical azimuthal structure; consequently, an $m=1$ one-arm instability can still grow in the matter distribution and appear in the gravitational wave signal even in a $\\pi$-symmetric run. To reveal any suppression, it suffices to increase resolution in a single $\\pi$-symmetric run until the $m=1$ mode appears.\n\nC. Although a $\\pi$-symmetric setup removes odd $m$ at linear order, nonlinear mode coupling from the dominant $m=2$ bar mode will generically regenerate an $m=1$ component that is identical to that of a full-domain evolution. Therefore, differences between $\\pi$-symmetric and full-domain evolutions of the HMNS vanish with increasing resolution, and no comparative experiment is required.\n\nD. A minimal experiment to expose artificial suppression is to construct identical initial data and explicitly seed a small $m=1$ perturbation in the HMNS (for example, a density perturbation proportional to $\\epsilon \\cos(\\phi)$ with $\\epsilon \\ll 1$), and then evolve both in a full $2\\pi$ domain and under $\\pi$-symmetry at several resolutions. In the full-domain runs, if the one-arm instability is physical, the diagnostic $C_1(t)$ and radiation modes $\\Psi_4^{\\ell\\,1}(t)$ should exhibit exponential growth characterized by a nonzero growth rate $\\gamma_1$, converging with resolution. In the $\\pi$-symmetric runs, the seeded odd-$m$ content will be projected out by the enforced symmetry to truncation error at the initial or first update step, and $C_1(t)$ and $\\Psi_4^{\\ell\\,1}(t)$ remain at noise level for all $t$.\n\nE.

It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. It presents a valid, substantive question in computational physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of First Principles\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the mathematical consequences of imposing $\\pi$-symmetry on a system described by a Fourier series in the azimuthal angle $\\phi$.\n\nThe condition of $\\pi$-symmetry requires that any evolved scalar field $f(t,r,\\phi,z)$ satisfies:\n$$f(t,r,\\phi,z) = f(t,r,\\phi+\\pi,z)$$\nWe can analyze the effect of this symmetry on the Fourier components of the field. The field is represented as a Fourier series:\n$$f(t,r,\\phi,z) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_m(t,r,z) e^{i m \\phi}$$\nApplying the symmetry condition to this series gives:\n$$\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_m(t,r,z) e^{i m \\phi} = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_m(t,r,z) e^{i m (\\phi+\\pi)}$$\nWe can factor the exponential term on the right-hand side:\n$$\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_m(t,r,z) e^{i m \\phi} = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_m(t,r,z) e^{i m \\phi} e^{i m \\pi}$$\nDue to the uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, this equality must hold for each mode $m$ individually:\n$$f_m(t,r,z) = f_m(t,r,z) e^{i m \\pi}$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$f_m(t,r,z) (1 - e^{i m \\pi}) = 0$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $e^{i m \\pi} = \\cos(m\\pi) + i\\sin(m\\pi)$. For any integer $m$, $\\sin(m\\pi)=0$ and $\\cos(m\\pi)=(-1)^m$. So, the condition becomes:\n$$f_m(t,r,z) (1 - (-1)^m) = 0$$\nWe analyze this condition for even and odd values of $m$:\n*   If $m$ is an **even** integer ($m=2k$ for some integer $k$), then $(-1)^m = 1$. The condition becomes $f_m (1 - 1) = 0$, or $f_m \\cdot 0 = 0$. This is always satisfied, so the amplitudes $f_m$ of even modes are not constrained by the symmetry.\n*   If $m$ is an **odd** integer ($m=2k+1$ for some integer $k$), then $(-1)^m = -1$. The condition becomes $f_m (1 - (-1)) = 0$, or $2 f_m = 0$. This requires that the amplitude of the mode must be zero: $f_m = 0$.\n\nTherefore, a direct consequence of imposing $\\pi$-symmetry is that all Fourier modes with an odd azimuthal number $m$ (e.g., $m=\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\ldots$) are forced to have zero amplitude. This applies to all evolved fields, including the matter density $\\rho$ and the fields that determine the gravitational wave signal, such as $\\Psi_4$. Any physical process that depends on the existence or growth of an odd-$m$ mode, such as the $m=1$ one-arm instability, is thus artificially suppressed by construction in a $\\pi$-symmetric simulation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Imposing $\\pi$-symmetry enforces $f(t,r,\\phi,z)=f(t,r,\\phi+\\pi,z)$ for all evolved fields $f$. For a Fourier component $e^{i m \\phi}$ this implies $e^{i m (\\phi+\\pi)}=(-1)^m e^{i m \\phi}$, so invariance requires vanishing amplitudes for all odd $m$. Therefore, any physical $m=1$ instability in the matter or metric sector is forbidden by construction. A clean numerical experiment is to perform two otherwise identical simulations, one in a full $2\\pi$ azimuthal domain and one with $\\pi$-symmetry, with identical initial data and identical small random or deterministic seed perturbations. One then tracks the time evolution of the normalized density mode $C_1(t)=\\left|\\int \\rho(t,\\mathbf{x})\\,e^{i\\,1\\,\\phi}\\,d^3x\\right|/ \\int \\rho(t,\\mathbf{x})\\,d^3x$ and the radiation modes $h_{\\ell\\,1}(t)$ or $\\Psi_4^{\\ell\\,1}(t)$ to measure a growth rate $\\gamma_1$ via $C_1(t)\\propto e^{\\gamma_1 t}$ in the full-domain run and its absence in the $\\pi$-symmetric run.**\n\nThis option is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n*   **Reasoning**: The mathematical reasoning that $\\pi$-symmetry implies $f_m=0$ for odd $m$ via the factor $(-1)^m$ is precisely correct. The conclusion that an $m=1$ mode is forbidden by construction is a direct and valid consequence.\n*   **Experimental Design**: The proposed experiment—comparing a full $2\\pi$ simulation with a $\\pi$-symmetric one—is the standard, scientifically rigorous method for isolating the effects of the symmetry assumption. Using small perturbations as seeds is a realistic way to trigger instabilities. Monitoring the $m=1$ modes in both matter ($C_1$) and gravitational waves ($\\Psi_4^{\\ell,1}$) is the correct diagnostic procedure. The predicted outcome (growth in the full run, absence in the symmetric run) is correct.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The $\\pi$-symmetry constraint only restricts gauge degrees of freedom and does not affect physical azimuthal structure; consequently, an $m=1$ one-arm instability can still grow in the matter distribution and appear in the gravitational wave signal even in a $\\pi$-symmetric run. To reveal any suppression, it suffices to increase resolution in a single $\\pi$-symmetric run until the $m=1$ mode appears.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed.\n*   **Reasoning**: The statement that $\\pi$-symmetry only affects gauge freedom is incorrect. It is a geometric constraint imposed on all fields, including physical, gauge-invariant quantities like the rest-mass density $\\rho$. As derived above, it explicitly forbids physical structures with odd-$m$ symmetry. The claim that an $m=1$ instability can grow is a direct contradiction of the mathematical properties of the symmetry.\n*   **Experimental Design**: The suggestion to increase resolution is misguided. Higher resolution reduces truncation error, meaning the numerical scheme will enforce the $\\pi$-symmetry *more accurately*, thus ensuring that any spurious $m=1$ mode is driven to zero more effectively, not that it will appear.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Although a $\\pi$-symmetric setup removes odd $m$ at linear order, nonlinear mode coupling from the dominant $m=2$ bar mode will generically regenerate an $m=1$ component that is identical to that of a full-domain evolution. Therefore, differences between $\\pi$-symmetric and full-domain evolutions of the HMNS vanish with increasing resolution, and no comparative experiment is required.**\n\nThis option misunderstands nonlinear dynamics under symmetry.\n*   **Reasoning**: The problem assumes the governing equations themselves respect the symmetry. Nonlinear terms in the equations involve products of fields. If a system's state contains only even-$m$ Fourier modes, any nonlinear interaction will combine these modes. For example, a quadratic interaction couples modes $m_1$ and $m_2$ to produce modes $m_1 \\pm m_2$. If $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both even, then $m_1 \\pm m_2$ is also even. More generally, any polynomial combination of even modes can only produce other even modes. It is impossible to generate an odd-$m$ mode from a state containing exclusively even-$m$ modes if the evolution equations themselves preserve the symmetry. The $m=1$ mode cannot be regenerated.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the $m=1$ mode remains absent, the difference between a $\\pi$-symmetric and a full-domain evolution (where $m=1$ can grow) will not vanish.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A minimal experiment to expose artificial suppression is to construct identical initial data and explicitly seed a small $m=1$ perturbation (for example, a density perturbation proportional to $\\epsilon \\cos(\\phi)$ with $\\epsilon \\ll 1$), and then evolve both in a full $2\\pi$ domain and under $\\pi$-symmetry at several resolutions. In the full-domain runs, if the one-arm instability is physical, the diagnostic $C_1(t)$ and radiation modes $\\Psi_4^{\\ell\\,1}(t)$ should exhibit exponential growth characterized by a nonzero growth rate $\\gamma_1$, converging with resolution. In the $\\pi$-symmetric runs, the seeded odd-$m$ content will be projected out by the enforced symmetry to truncation error at the initial or first update step, and $C_1(t)$ and $\\Psi_4^{\\ell\\,1}(t)$ remain at noise level for all $t$.**\n\nThis option describes a valid and well-designed experiment.\n*   **Reasoning**: The core logic is sound. In a full-domain run, an explicit $m=1$ seed will grow if the system is physically unstable to that mode. The statement about convergence with resolution is a hallmark of a correct numerical simulation of a physical process.\n*   **Experimental Design**: The description of what happens in the $\\pi$-symmetric run is precise. Based on Assumption 2, the algorithm \"correctly enforces the imposed discrete symmetry\". This means it must actively remove any components that violate the symmetry. A seeded $m=1$ mode is such a component, and it will be \"projected out\" (i.e., removed) by the algorithm, typically at initialization or the first time-step. The consequence, that the $m=1$ diagnostics will remain at the level of numerical noise, is correct. This constitutes a valid experiment, very similar in spirit and outcome to the one in Option A.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Gravitational Waves (GW) extracted at large radius are insensitive to the azimuthal mode content of the source, so $\\pi$-symmetry cannot influence the observed spectrum. Therefore, one should focus strictly on internal fluid diagnostics and omit any comparison of $h_{\\ell m}(t)$ or $\\Psi_4^{\\ell m}(t)$ between symmetry-enforced and full-domain runs.**\n\nThis option is based on a false premise about gravitational waves.\n*   **Reasoning**: The statement that gravitational waves are insensitive to the source's azimuthal mode content is incorrect. The multipolar decomposition of the gravitational wave field into spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes $(\\ell, m)$ is the mathematical tool that directly connects the angular structure of the waves to the angular structure of the source dynamics. A source with only even-$m$ density and metric perturbations (as enforced by $\\pi$-symmetry) will radiate gravitational waves that contain only even-$m$ spherical harmonic modes. Conversely, an $m=1$ instability in the source is a primary producer of $m=1$ gravitational wave modes. The GW signal is a critical and direct probe of the source's azimuthal dynamics.\n*   **Conclusion**: To omit the comparison of GW signals would be to discard a crucial piece of evidence. The experimental design is therefore poor.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Summary of Correct Options\n\nOptions A and D both correctly describe the physical consequences of imposing $\\pi$-symmetry and propose valid, well-designed numerical experiments to demonstrate the artificial suppression of the $m=1$ mode.

Therefore, we can write:\n$$ \\rho^2 \\approx \\frac{4}{S_{0}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df $$\nThe Fourier transform $\\tilde{h}(f)$ of the signal $h(t)$ is defined as $\\tilde{h}(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t) \\exp(-i2\\pi f t) dt$. Instead of directly computing the Fourier transform and its integral, it is more direct to use Parseval's theorem, which states that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df$.\n\nSince the signal $h(t)$ is real, its Fourier transform satisfies $\\tilde{h}(-f) = \\tilde{h}^{*}(f)$, which implies $|\\tilde{h}(-f)|^2 = |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2$. This allows us to write:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df $$\nCombining these results, the integral needed for the SNR can be related to the time-domain signal:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt $$\nThe signal is given by $h(t) = A\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau)\\,\\cos(2\\pi f_{2} t)\\,u(t)$.

Here, $a=2/\\tau$ and $b=4\\pi f_{2}$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-2t/\\tau) \\cos(4\\pi f_{2} t) dt = \\frac{2/\\tau}{(2/\\tau)^2 + (4\\pi f_{2})^2} = \\frac{2\\tau}{4 + (4\\pi f_{2} \\tau)^2} = \\frac{\\tau}{2} \\frac{1}{1 + (2\\pi f_{2} \\tau)^2} $$\nThe product $f_{2}\\tau = (2.5 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz})(2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 50$, which is much greater than $1$. Thus, the quantity $(2\\pi f_{2} \\tau)^2 \\gg 1$, and the second integral term is negligible compared to the first. This is a common and highly accurate approximation for such signals. Therefore, we have:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt \\approx \\frac{A^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\tau}{2} \\right) = \\frac{A^2 \\tau}{4} $$\nSubstituting this back, we find the integral of the squared Fourier transform:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\tilde{h}(f)|^2 df = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)|^2 dt \\approx \\frac{A^2 \\tau}{8} $$\nNow we can write the expression for the squared SNR:\n$$ \\rho^2 \\approx \\frac{4}{S_{0}} \\left( \\frac{A^2 \\tau}{8} \\right) = \\frac{A^2 \\tau}{2S_{0}} $$\nThe SNR is therefore $\\rho \\approx A \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}}$.\n\nThe signal amplitude $A$ scales inversely with luminosity distance $D$, so $A(D) = k/D$ for some constant $k$.

Thus, the amplitude at an arbitrary distance $D$ is:\n$$ A(D) = A_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{D} $$\nSubstituting this into the SNR expression gives the SNR as a function of distance:\n$$ \\rho(D) = A_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{D} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}} $$\nWe need to find the distance $D_{5}$ for which the SNR is $\\rho=5$.\n$$ 5 = A_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{D_{5}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}} $$\nSolving for $D_{5}$:\n$$ D_{5} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{ref}} D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{5} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $A_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-22}$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$\n- $\\tau = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $S_{0} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-50}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term inside the square root:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{2 \\times (9.0 \\times 10^{-50}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1})} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{18.0 \\times 10^{-50}} \\,\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{Hz} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 10^{48} $$\nThe square root is:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2S_{0}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9} \\times 10^{48}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{24} $$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $D_{5}$:\n$$ D_{5} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-22}) \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{Mpc})}{5} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{24} \\right) $$\n$$ D_{5} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-21}}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{24} \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} $$\n$$ D_{5} = \\frac{1}{15} \\times 10^{3} \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} = \\frac{1000}{15} \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} = \\frac{200}{3} \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} $$\n$$ D_{5} = 66.666... \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ D_{5} \\approx 66.7 \\,\\mathrm{Mpc} $$\nFinal check of the calculation:\n$A_{\\mathrm{ref}} D_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10^{-22} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{Mpc} = 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$.\n$\\sqrt{\\tau/(2S_0)} = \\sqrt{(20 \\times 10^{-3}) / (2 \\times 9 \\times 10^{-50})} = \\sqrt{(20/18) \\times 10^{47}} = \\sqrt{(10/9) \\times 10^{47}} = \\sqrt{(100/9) \\times 10^{46}} = (10/3) \\times 10^{23}$.\n$D_5 = \\frac{10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}{5} \\times \\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{23} = \\frac{10^{-21} \\times 10^{24}}{15}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc} = \\frac{10^3}{15}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc} = \\frac{1000}{15}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc} = 66.666... \\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$.\nThe calculation is correct.
