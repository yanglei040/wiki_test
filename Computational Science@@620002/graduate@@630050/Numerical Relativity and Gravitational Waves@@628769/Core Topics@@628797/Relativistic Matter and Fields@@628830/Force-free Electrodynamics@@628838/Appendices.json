The force-free constraints are $E \\cdot B = 0$ and $B^{2} - E^{2} > 0$. Assume a homogeneous background with $E = 0$ and $B = B_{0} \\hat{z}$ so that the principal (hyperbolic) part of the evolution system is governed by the Maxwell equations in a curved spacetime, and adopt geometrized units with $c=1$. The numerical scheme is a finite-volume, method-of-lines discretization using a Local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) flux in each spatial direction, combined with a third-order Strong-Stability-Preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP RK) time integrator.

The derivation will be based on first principles.\n\nThe CFL condition is a necessary condition for the stability of explicit time-integration schemes for hyperbolic partial differential equations. It ensures that the numerical domain of dependence of a grid point contains the physical domain of dependence. For a method-of-lines approach on a 3D Cartesian grid, this principle manifests as a constraint on the timestep $\\Delta t$. The numerical information at a grid point $(i,j,k)$ is updated using information from neighboring points. The physical information, however, propagates at the characteristic speeds of the system. Stability requires that in one timestep, no physical signal can propagate further than the spatial extent of the numerical stencil.\n\nFor a finite-volume scheme using fluxes from immediate neighbors on a grid with spacings $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, $\\Delta z$, combined with an explicit time integrator, the stability condition is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^x}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^y}{\\Delta y} + \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^z}{\\Delta z} \\right) \\le C_{\\text{CFL}}\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda_{\\max}^i$ represents the maximum magnitude of the characteristic speed of the system in the coordinate direction $i$, and $C_{\\text{CFL}}$ is the CFL number, a constant determined by the stability region of the chosen time integration scheme.\n\nThe problem states that a third-order Strong-Stability-Preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP RK3) method is used. A fundamental property of the standard SSP RK3 scheme, when used with first-order accurate spatial discretizations like the Local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) flux specified, is that its CFL number is $C_{\\text{CFL}} = 1$.\n\nThe next step is to derive the expressions for the maximum characteristic speeds, $\\lambda_{\\max}^i$. The principal part of the evolution system is governed by Maxwell's equations. In a general relativistic context, electromagnetic disturbances (light waves) propagate along null geodesics, for which the spacetime interval $ds^2$ is zero. The geometry of the spacetime is described by the $3+1$ decomposed metric:\n$$\nds^2 = -\\alpha^2 dt^2 + \\gamma_{ij} (dx^i + \\beta^i dt)(dx^j + \\beta^j dt)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the lapse function, $\\beta^i$ is the shift vector, and $\\gamma_{ij}$ is the 3-metric on the spatial hypersurfaces.\n\nSetting $ds^2=0$ for a null trajectory and dividing by $(dt)^2$, we obtain an equation for the coordinate velocity $v^i = \\frac{dx^i}{dt}$ of the disturbance:\n$$\n\\alpha^2 = \\gamma_{ij} \\left(\\frac{dx^i}{dt} + \\beta^i\\right) \\left(\\frac{dx^j}{dt} + \\beta^j\\right) = \\gamma_{ij} (v^i + \\beta^i)(v^j + \\beta^j)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a uniform grid with spacings $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta z$. This implies the use of a locally Cartesian coordinate system where the spatial metric is Euclidean, i.e., $\\gamma_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. With this simplification, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\alpha^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^3 (v^i + \\beta^i)^2\n$$\nLet's define a new vector $V^i = v^i + \\beta^i$. The equation is then $\\sum_i (V^i)^2 = \\alpha^2$, which means the vector $\\mathbf{V}$ has a magnitude equal to the lapse $\\alpha$. We can express this vector as $\\mathbf{V} = \\alpha \\mathbf{n}$, where $\\mathbf{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector ($|\\mathbf{n}|=1$). The coordinate velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is therefore given by:\n$$\nv^i = \\alpha n^i - \\beta^i\n$$\nThe quantity $\\lambda_{\\max}^x$ required for the CFL condition is the maximum possible magnitude of the coordinate velocity component in the $x$-direction, considering all possible propagation directions $\\mathbf{n}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}^x = \\max_{|\\mathbf{n}|=1} |v^x| = \\max_{|\\mathbf{n}|=1} |\\alpha n^x - \\beta^x|\n$$\nThe components of the unit vector $\\mathbf{n}$ satisfy $(n^x)^2 + (n^y)^2 + (n^z)^2 = 1$, which implies $|n^x| \\le 1$. The maximum value of the expression $|\\alpha n^x - \\beta^x|$ occurs at the boundary of the allowed range for $n^x$, which is $n^x = \\pm 1$. The maximum value is therefore $\\max(|\\alpha - \\beta^x|, |-\\alpha - \\beta^x|) = \\max(|\\alpha - \\beta^x|, |\\alpha + \\beta^x|)$. Since the lapse function $\\alpha$ must be positive for a valid spacetime foliation, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}^x = \\alpha + |\\beta^x|\n$$\nBy symmetry, the maximum characteristic speeds in the $y$ and $z$ directions are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}^y = \\alpha + |\\beta^y|\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}^z = \\alpha + |\\beta^z|\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions and $C_{\\text{CFL}} = 1$ back into the CFL condition, we obtain the stability restriction on the timestep:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\alpha + |\\beta^x|}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{\\alpha + |\\beta^y|}{\\Delta y} + \\frac{\\alpha + |\\beta^z|}{\\Delta z}}\n$$\nThe maximum stable timestep, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is achieved when equality holds.\n\nNow we compute the value of $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ for the specific case provided:\n$\\alpha = 0.8$, $\\beta^{x} = 0.1$, $\\beta^{y} = -0.05$, $\\beta^{z} = 0.0$, $\\Delta x = 0.25$, $\\Delta y = 0.20$, and $\\Delta z = 0.50$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha + |\\beta^x|}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{0.8 + |0.1|}{0.25} = \\frac{0.9}{0.25} = 3.6\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha + |\\beta^y|}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{0.8 + |-0.05|}{0.20} = \\frac{0.8 + 0.05}{0.20} = \\frac{0.85}{0.20} = 4.25\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha + |\\beta^z|}{\\Delta z} = \\frac{0.8 + |0.0|}{0.50} = \\frac{0.8}{0.50} = 1.6\n$$\nThe sum of these terms is:\n$$\nS = 3.6 + 4.25 + 1.6 = 9.45\n$$\nThe maximum stable timestep is the reciprocal of this sum:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1}{9.45} \\approx 0.1058201058...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} \\approx 0.1058\n$$\nThis time is expressed in geometrized units, typically normalized by a characteristic mass scale $M$, consistent with the problem's context.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1058}$$", "id": "3474662"}, {"introduction": "Before a numerical code can be trusted to explore unknown physics, it must first be verified against known solutions.

Analytical Framework and Field Construction**\n\nThe problem is set on a two-dimensional periodic square domain, $(x, y) \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$. We begin by constructing analytic electromagnetic fields that satisfy the relevant FFE conditions by design. The fields are derived from a time-dependent vector potential $\\mathbf{A}(x,y,t) = (0, 0, A_z(x,y,t))$ with a single non-zero component:\n$$\nA_z(x,y,t) = \\frac{A_0}{k_x k_y} \\sin(k_x x)\\,\\sin(k_y y)\\,\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ and electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ are defined via the potentials as $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{E} = -\\partial_t \\mathbf{A}$. This construction analytically guarantees that the two homogeneous Maxwell equations, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ and $\\partial_t \\mathbf{B} + \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$, are satisfied.\n\nThe problem specifies the explicit forms of the fields, including a constant background component $B_0$ added to $B_x$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_x(x,y,t) &= B_{0} + \\frac{A_0}{k_x} \\sin(k_x x)\\,\\cos(k_y y)\\,\\cos(\\omega t) \\\\\nB_y(x,y,t) &= -\\frac{A_0}{k_y} \\cos(k_x x)\\,\\sin(k_y y)\\,\\cos(\\omega t) \\\\\nB_z(x,y,t) &= 0 \\\\\nE_x(x,y,t) &= 0 \\\\\nE_y(x,y,t) &= 0 \\\\\nE_z(x,y,t) &= \\frac{A_0\\omega}{k_x k_y}\\sin(k_x x)\\,\\sin(k_y y)\\,\\sin(\\omega t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThese fields also satisfy the FFE degeneracy condition $\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ identically, as $\\mathbf{E}$ is purely in the $\\hat{z}$ direction while $\\mathbf{B}$ lies in the $xy$-plane. All field components are evaluated on a uniform $N \\times N$ grid at a fixed time $t_0 = 0.3$.\n\n**2. Numerical Discretization and Derivatives**\n\nThe diagnostics require computing spatial derivatives of the gridded fields. These are approximated using second-order centered finite differences. For a scalar field $f(x_i, y_j)$ on a grid with uniform spacing $h$, the partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right|_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{f_{i+1,j} - f_{i-1,j}}{2h}, \\quad \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right|_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{f_{i,j+1} - f_{i,j-1}}{2h}\n$$\nThe periodic boundary conditions are handled by wrapping indices, such that $f_{N,j} = f_{0,j}$ and $f_{-1,j} = f_{N-1,j}$.\n\n**3. Diagnostic Computations**\n\nThree primary diagnostics are computed on the discrete fields at time $t_0$.\n\n**a. Divergence Constraint Residual:**\nAnalytically, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. The numerical residual, $r_{\\mathrm{div}} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$, is computed by applying the finite difference operators:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{div}}(x_i, y_j) \\approx \\frac{B_x(x_{i+1}, y_j) - B_x(x_{i-1}, y_j)}{2h} + \\frac{B_y(x_i, y_{j+1}) - B_y(x_i, y_{j-1})}{2h}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the violation is quantified by the Root Mean Square (RMS) $L^2$-norm:\n$$\n\\|r_{\\mathrm{div}}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i,j=0}^{N-1} r_{\\mathrm{div}}(x_i,y_j)^2}\n$$\n\n**b. Faraday's Law Residual:**\nAnalytically, $\\partial_t \\mathbf{B} + \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$. The numerical residual vector $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{Faraday}}$ is formed by combining the analytic time derivatives of $\\mathbf{B}$ with the numerically computed curl of $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{Faraday}} = \\partial_t \\mathbf{B} + (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E})_{\\text{numerical}}\n$$\nGiven $\\mathbf{E} = (0, 0, E_z)$, its curl is $(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = (\\partial_y E_z, -\\partial_x E_z, 0)$. The residual components are:\n$$\nr_x(x_i, y_j) = \\partial_t B_x(x_i, y_j, t_0) + \\frac{E_z(x_i, y_{j+1}) - E_z(x_i, y_{j-1})}{2h} \\\\\nr_y(x_i, y_j) = \\partial_t B_y(x_i, y_j, t_0) - \\frac{E_z(x_{i+1}, y_j) - E_z(x_{i-1}, y_j)}{2h}\n$$\nThe analytic time derivatives $\\partial_t B_x$ and $\\partial_t B_y$ are evaluated directly from their definitions. The RMS $L^2$-norm of this vector residual is then computed.\n\n**c. Magnetic Dominance Check:**\nThe FFE condition $B^2 - E^2 \\ge 0$ must hold. This is checked at every grid point. To account for floating-point inaccuracies, the condition is relaxed to $\\min(B^2 - E^2) \\ge -\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a small, scale-sensitive tolerance defined as $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12} \\max\\{\\langle B^2\\rangle, 1\\}$, with $\\langle B^2\\rangle$ being the grid-averaged value of $B^2$. A boolean value, $\\mathrm{mag\\_ok}$, reports the outcome of this check.\n\n**4. Convergence Analysis**\n\nThe core of the validation is to measure the empirical order of convergence, $p$. For a numerical method with truncation error proportional to $h^k$, the measured error norm $E$ should scale as $E \\propto h^k$. When the resolution is doubled ($N \\to 2N$), the error should decrease by a factor of $2^k$. The convergence order $p$ (which should approximate $k$) can be estimated from errors on a coarse grid ($E_{\\text{coarse}}$) and a fine grid ($E_{\\text{fine}}$):\n$$\np = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{E_{\\text{coarse}}}{E_{\\text{fine}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis analysis is performed for both $\\|r_{\\mathrm{div}}\\|_2$ and $\\|\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{Faraday}}\\|_2$ using three grid resolutions: $N_0$, $2N_0$, and $4N_0$.

The analysis is conducted within a $3+1$ spacetime decomposition using the Zero Angular Momentum Observer (ZAMO) orthonormal frame.\n\n### 1. Derivation of Flux Components in the ZAMO Frame\n\nWe are tasked with computing the near-horizon energy flux density $T^{r}_{\\ t}$ and angular momentum flux density $T^{r}_{\\ \\phi}$ in the ZAMO orthonormal frame. In this frame, the spacetime metric is the Minkowski metric, $\\eta_{\\hat{\\mu}\\hat{\\nu}} = \\text{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)$. We interpret $T^{r}_{\\ t}$ and $T^{r}_{\\ \\phi}$ as the mixed-index components $T^{\\hat{r}}_{\\ \\hat{t}}$ and $T^{\\hat{r}}_{\\ \\hat{\\phi}}$.\n- Energy Flux Density: $T^{r}_{\\ t} \\equiv -T^{\\hat{r}\\hat{t}} = -g^{\\hat{r}} = -(\\vec{E} \\times \\vec{B})^{\\hat{r}}$\n- Angular Momentum Flux Density: $T^{r}_{\\ \\phi} \\equiv T^{\\hat{r}\\hat{\\phi}}$\n\nThe problem specifies the non-zero field components as $B^r(\\theta,t)$, $B^{\\phi}(\\theta,t)$, and $E^{\\theta}(\\theta,t)$. The field vectors are $\\vec{E} = (0, E^{\\theta}, 0)$ and $\\vec{B} = (B^r, 0, B^{\\phi})$.\nThe radial component of the Poynting vector is $g^r = E^{\\theta} B^{\\phi}$. The energy flux density is therefore:\n$$ T^{r}_{\\ t}(\\theta,t) = - E^{\\theta}(\\theta,t) B^{\\phi}(\\theta,t) $$\nThe spatial stress component $T^{r\\phi}$ is $B^r B^{\\phi}$. The angular momentum flux density is:\n$$ T^{r}_{\\ \\phi}(\\theta,t) = B^r(\\theta,t) B^{\\phi}(\\theta,t) $$\n\n### 2. Substitution of Field Models\n\nWe substitute the provided expressions for the field components, with $\\rho(\\theta) = r_H \\sin\\theta$:\n- $B^{\\phi}(\\theta,t) = \\zeta \\Omega_F r_H \\sin\\theta B^r(t)$\n- $E^{\\theta}(\\theta,t) = \\alpha(t)[\\Omega_F - \\omega(t)] r_H \\sin\\theta B^r(t)$\n\nThe flux densities become:\n$$ T^{r}_{\\ t}(\\theta,t) = \\zeta \\Omega_F \\alpha(t)[\\omega(t) - \\Omega_F] r_H^2 [B^r(t)]^2 \\sin^2\\theta $$\n$$ T^{r}_{\\ \\phi}(\\theta,t) = \\zeta \\Omega_F r_H [B^r(t)]^2 \\sin\\theta $$\n\n### 3. Horizon Area-Averaging\n\nThe area-averaged flux $\\langle X \\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}}$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} X(\\theta,t) \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$.\n- Area-averaged energy flux: The integral $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin^3\\theta \\, d\\theta = 4/3$ leads to:\n$$ \\langle T^{r}_{\\ t} \\rangle(t) = \\frac{2}{3} \\zeta \\Omega_F \\alpha(t)[\\omega(t) - \\Omega_F] r_H^2 [B^r(t)]^2 $$\n- Area-averaged angular momentum flux: The integral $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\pi/2$ leads to:\n$$ \\langle T^{r}_{\\ \\phi} \\rangle(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\zeta \\Omega_F r_H [B^r(t)]^2 $$\n\n### 4.
