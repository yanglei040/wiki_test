## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having journeyed through the underlying principles and symmetries that give birth to Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), we might be tempted to sit back and admire the theoretical elegance of it all. But that would be missing half the fun! The true magic of physics reveals itself when abstract principles manifest as tangible, often surprising, phenomena. These materials are not just theoretical curiosities; they are remarkable laboratories where the universe, in a sense, performs experiments for us. They are a playground where concepts from high-energy physics, quantum information, and materials science all come together to dance. So, let’s step into this playground and see what wonders await.

### Seeing the Unseen: Probing Topological States

The most striking prediction for a Weyl semimetal is the existence of its bizarre [surface states](@entry_id:137922)—the Fermi arcs. Unlike the closed loops of a typical metal's Fermi surface, these are open segments that stretch across the surface Brillouin zone, tethered at their ends to the projections of the bulk Weyl nodes. But how do we know they are really there? Can we "see" these arcs?

Indeed, we can. Techniques like Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) act like a powerful camera for momentum space, allowing us to directly map out the electronic bands and, with them, the Fermi arcs. What's more, these arcs are not static objects. As we tune the chemical potential, perhaps by applying a gate voltage to the material, the shape and length of the arcs evolve in a predictable way. Computational models, using tools like the Green's function formalism, can precisely calculate the expected surface [spectral function](@entry_id:147628), which is what ARPES measures. These models allow us to simulate how the arcs will twist and shrink as we move the Fermi level, providing a detailed guide for experimental verification [@problem_id:3503556].

But there are other, more subtle ways to catch a glimpse of this hidden world. Imagine the surface of a Weyl semimetal. The electrons moving on it are quantum waves, and where there are waves, there is interference. A Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) can map the local density of [electronic states](@entry_id:171776) on the surface with atomic precision. In the presence of even a single impurity, electron waves scatter off it and create a standing wave pattern, much like ripples on a pond. This pattern is called a quasi-particle interference (QPI) pattern.

Now for the clever part: the features of this real-space interference pattern are intimately related to the shape of the Fermi surface in momentum space. Specifically, the Fourier transform of the QPI pattern reveals the "scattering vectors" that connect different points on a constant-energy contour. For a typical closed Fermi surface, this leads to a complex but isotropic pattern. But for a Fermi arc, the most prominent scattering is between its two ends. This creates a highly anisotropic QPI pattern. By analyzing the Fourier-transformed QPI signal, we can distinguish an open Fermi arc from a closed loop and even determine its orientation [@problem_id:3503604]. It's a beautiful example of how a real-space measurement can unveil the topological structure of [momentum space](@entry_id:148936).

The bulk has its own secrets to tell. When a magnetic field is applied, electrons are forced into [cyclotron](@entry_id:154941) orbits, leading to the [quantization of energy](@entry_id:137825) into Landau levels. As we vary the magnetic field, these levels sweep past the Fermi energy, causing oscillations in properties like magnetization (the de Haas-van Alphen effect) or resistivity (the Shubnikov-de Haas effect). For ordinary electrons, the phase of these oscillations is well-understood. But for the relativistic quasiparticles in a Dirac or Weyl semimetal, there is a twist. As an electron completes a [cyclotron](@entry_id:154941) orbit in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), its wavefunction acquires a geometric phase, the Berry phase, which for a Dirac fermion is equal to $\pi$. This extra phase shift leaves an unmistakable fingerprint on the [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355), which can be extracted from a "Landau fan" diagram. Observing this specific phase shift is one of the smoking-gun signatures of the topological nature of the charge carriers [@problem_id:2812578].

Perhaps the most spectacular manifestation of the interplay between surface and bulk is the "Weyl orbit." In a thin slab of a Weyl semimetal, under a perpendicular magnetic field, an electron can embark on an extraordinary journey. It can travel along a Fermi arc on the top surface, plunge into the bulk along a special one-way chiral Landau level, emerge on the bottom surface, traverse the Fermi arc there in the opposite direction, and finally return to the top surface through the bulk. This peculiar, stitched-together orbit, part surface and part bulk, is also quantized and gives rise to its own set of [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355). The remarkable prediction, and subsequent observation, is that the frequency of these oscillations depends on the *thickness* of the material slab—a direct consequence of this bizarre hybrid orbit [@problem_id:3503569].

### The Flow of Charge: A Symphony of Topology and Electromagnetism

The unique electronic structure of Weyl semimetals gives rise to a host of equally unique [transport phenomena](@entry_id:147655). The separation of Weyl nodes in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) acts as a kind of "topological dipole," with profound consequences for how electrons respond to electric and magnetic fields.

The most celebrated example is the Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE). In a normal Hall effect, a current flowing in a magnetic field produces a transverse voltage. The AHE produces a transverse voltage even without an external magnetic field. In a Weyl semimetal, the intrinsic AHE is directly proportional to the momentum-space separation of the Weyl nodes. One can imagine the 3D material as a continuous stack of 2D layers in momentum space. For the momentum slices between two Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105), each 2D system is like a quantum Hall insulator with a quantized Chern number, $C=1$. For slices outside this region, the Chern number is zero. The total 3D anomalous Hall conductivity is, beautifully, just the integral of these 2D quantized conductivities over all the slices. The further apart the nodes, the larger the integrated effect [@problem_id:3503544].

Things get even stranger when we apply electric ($E$) and magnetic ($B$) fields parallel to each other. In most materials, this configuration does very little. But in a Weyl semimetal, it unleashes the **[chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077)**. This is a deep concept borrowed from quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241) (QFT), which states that the number of left-handed and right-handed particles is not separately conserved in the presence of parallel $E$ and $B$ fields. In a Weyl semimetal, the two chiralities correspond to the two types of Weyl nodes. The parallel fields act as a pump, transferring electrons from nodes of one chirality to nodes of the other, at a rate proportional to $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$ [@problem_id:3503547]. This pumping action creates a non-equilibrium population of carriers, which in turn leads to a large additional current flowing along the magnetic field. The upshot is a large, positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity—or, equivalently, a [negative magnetoresistance](@entry_id:136874)—a key experimental signature that a material is hosting Weyl fermions [@problem_id:3503533].

The broken inversion symmetry that is essential for a Weyl semimetal also opens the door to nonlinear optical and transport effects. While ordinary metals respond linearly to a weak electric field ($J \propto E$), these materials can have a second-order response. One such phenomenon is the **nonlinear Hall effect**, where a transverse current appears that is quadratic in the applied electric field ($J_{\text{nonlinear}} \propto E^2$). This effect is governed by a quantity called the **Berry curvature dipole**, which measures the net "lopsidedness" of the Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Symmetry plays a starring role here: the effect is only allowed if the crystal's symmetries permit it. In some models, the contributions from different nodes can exactly cancel, leading to a zero response [@problem_id:3503555]. A related phenomenon is the Circular Photogalvanic Effect (CPGE), where shining [circularly polarized light](@entry_id:198374) on the material can generate a direct current. This, too, is a nonlinear response whose existence and character are dictated by the symmetries of the crystal and the topology of its bands [@problem_id:3503529].

### Engineering Topology: From Theory to Custom Materials

One of the most exciting aspects of topological materials is that they are not just passively discovered; they can be actively engineered. We can use external knobs to tune, create, and annihilate their topological features.

A Dirac semimetal is often a "parent" state for a Weyl semimetal. In a Dirac semimetal, the nodes are protected by both time-reversal and [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948), forcing Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105) to exist at the same point in momentum space. What happens if we break one of these symmetries? For instance, applying mechanical strain to the crystal can break [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948). This acts as a perturbation that splits the degenerate Dirac point into a pair of spatially separated Weyl points [@problem_id:3503520]. By carefully controlling the strain, we can control the separation of the nodes and, therefore, the magnitude of [topological effects](@entry_id:195527) like the anomalous Hall conductivity. This is a [topological phase transition](@entry_id:137214) on demand.

Another powerful tool is chemistry. By substituting some atoms in a crystal with others (a process called alloying or doping), we can continuously tune the electronic structure. For instance, in the famous Weyl semimetal TaAs, one can replace arsenic (As) with phosphorus (P) to form $\text{TaAs}_{1-x}\text{P}_x$. Using models like the Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA), we can predict how the band parameters change with the substitution fraction $x$. This allows us to map out a "[phase diagram](@entry_id:142460)" showing how the number and positions of Weyl nodes evolve with chemical composition, guiding the synthesis of new materials with optimized topological properties [@problem_id:3503528].

The concept of engineering can be taken to even more exotic levels. Imagine applying not a uniform strain, but a carefully designed, spatially varying strain texture. It turns out that such a strain field can act on the electrons as an effective, or **pseudo-magnetic field**. This field is not generated by any external magnet; it is a manifestation of the curved geometry that the electrons experience as they move through the distorted lattice. For a specific strain texture, one can generate a uniform pseudo-magnetic field, $\mathbf{B}_5$, that couples to the electron's [chirality](@entry_id:144105). This field will then quantize the electron's energy into **pseudo-Landau levels**, just as a real magnetic field would. This remarkable phenomenon shows that the very fabric of the crystal can be bent and twisted to create [emergent gauge fields](@entry_id:146708) for the quasiparticles living within it [@problem_id:2870327].

### A Bridge Between Worlds: Condensed Matter as a Cosmic Simulator

Perhaps the most profound aspect of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) is the way they connect the world of materials science to the deepest ideas from high-energy physics and quantum information. They act as "tabletop universes" where we can observe phenomena once thought to be the exclusive domain of particle accelerators or the early universe.

We've already encountered the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077). This was first discovered in the 1960s as a subtle quantum effect in the theory of relativistic fermions. For decades, it was a cornerstone of the Standard Model of particle physics, but a direct, clean observation was difficult. Suddenly, here it is, manifesting itself robustly as the [negative magnetoresistance](@entry_id:136874) of a solid-state crystal.

The connections run even deeper. The effective theory of electromagnetism inside some of these materials is described by **[axion electrodynamics](@entry_id:144423)**. The standard Maxwell's equations are modified by a topological term, $\mathcal{L}_{\theta} \propto \theta \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$. This term has extraordinary consequences. For example, if one were to place a magnetic monopole inside such a material, it would induce an electric charge around it—an effect first predicted by Witten in the context of [grand unified theories](@entry_id:156647) [@problem_id:1239167]. While we haven't found [magnetic monopoles](@entry_id:142817) in vacuum, the equations governing these crystals demand that this effect must occur.

Finally, the very existence of the Fermi arc surface states is tied to the quantum entanglement structure of the bulk ground state. If you partition the system into two halves and trace out the degrees of freedom of one half, you are left with a density matrix for the other. The logarithm of this matrix defines an "entanglement Hamiltonian." The **entanglement-[boundary correspondence](@entry_id:167571)** principle states that the spectrum of this entanglement Hamiltonian mirrors the energy spectrum of the physical boundary. For a Weyl semimetal, the gapless modes in the [entanglement spectrum](@entry_id:138110) form "entanglement Fermi arcs" that correspond precisely to the physical Fermi arcs on the surface [@problem_id:1239148]. The exotic surface states are, in a very real sense, a hologram of the bulk's [quantum entanglement](@entry_id:136576).

From benchtop experiments probing the flow of charge to simulating the physics of the cosmos, Weyl and Dirac semimetals offer an incredibly rich and fertile ground for discovery. They remind us that the fundamental laws of nature are unified, and that by studying a humble crystal, we may yet uncover secrets about the universe itself.
