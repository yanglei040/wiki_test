The provided model, the overdamped Langevin equation, is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics for describing Brownian motion in a potential. The use of a harmonic approximation for the free energy landscape and the application of standard constant force and constant velocity steering protocols are standard, well-established techniques in the field of computational materials science and biophysics, specifically in Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD). All parameters, initial conditions, and objectives are clearly defined, constituting a solvable initial value problem for a linear ordinary differential equation. The parameter values are physically realistic for molecular-scale simulations. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the one-dimensional overdamped Langevin equation:\n$$\n\\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\frac{dU}{dx} + f_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) + \\xi(t)\n$$\nwhere $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{a} x^{2}$, $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient, $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)$ is the time-dependent external steering force, and $\\xi(t)$ is a thermal noise term with zero mean, $\\langle \\xi(t) \\rangle = 0$. The force derived from the background potential is $-\\frac{dU}{dx} = -k_a x$.\n\nAs stated in the problem, the ensemble average $\\langle x(t) \\rangle$ obeys a deterministic equation. We find this equation by taking the ensemble average of the Langevin equation.

We now solve this equation for the two specified protocols with the initial condition $\\langle x(0) \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**1. Constant Force Steering**\n\nFor this protocol, the external force is a constant, $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) = F_{0}$. This force term is independent of the coordinate $x$, so its ensemble average is simply $\\langle f_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) \\rangle = F_{0}$.

The homogeneous equation is $\\gamma \\frac{d\\langle x_h \\rangle}{dt} + k_a \\langle x_h \\rangle = 0$, which has the solution $\\langle x_h(t) \\rangle = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_a}{\\gamma}t\\right)$, where $C$ is a constant.

This powerful technique represents a move from simply analyzing SMD trajectories to actively designing more efficient and physically meaningful simulation pathways.", "problem": "You are given a one-dimensional steered molecular dynamics problem formulated in the space of a single collective variable $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. A harmonic steering potential imposes a prescribed protocol $\\lambda(t)$ over a fixed duration $\\tau$, and the dissipation is quantified within linear response by a generalized friction metric $g(\\lambda)$ that encodes equilibrium force autocorrelation along the collective variable. Assume that the instantaneous excess power is $P_{\\mathrm{ex}}(t) = \\dot{\\lambda}(t)^2 g(\\lambda(t))$, so that the total excess work is $W_{\\mathrm{ex}}[\\lambda(\\cdot)] = \\int_0^\\tau \\dot{\\lambda}(t)^2 g(\\lambda(t))\\, dt$.

Rigorously justify your construction using calculus of variations or an inequality derived from well-tested facts in statistical mechanics, and express the minimal excess work in terms of path functionals that can be computed from $g(\\lambda)$ without simulating dynamics.

Here, $\\dot{\\lambda}(t)$ denotes the time derivative $d\\lambda/dt$.\n\nWe will derive the minimal work using an inequality derived from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any two real-valued, square-integrable functions $f(t)$ and $h(t)$ on an interval $[a,b]$,\n$$\n\\left( \\int_a^b f(t) h(t) \\, dt \\right)^2 \\le \\left( \\int_a^b f(t)^2 \\, dt \\right) \\left( \\int_a^b h(t)^2 \\, dt \\right)\n$$\nEquality holds if and only if one function is a constant multiple of the other, i.e., $f(t) = c \\cdot h(t)$ for some constant $c$.\n\nLet us define the functions $f(t) = \\sqrt{g(\\lambda(t))} \\dot{\\lambda}(t)$ and $h(t) = 1$, and the integration interval as $[0, \\tau]$. Applying the inequality:\n$$\n\\left( \\int_0^\\tau \\left(\\sqrt{g(\\lambda(t))} \\dot{\\lambda}(t)\\right) \\cdot 1 \\, dt \\right)^2 \\le \\left( \\int_0^\\tau \\left(\\sqrt{g(\\lambda(t))} \\dot{\\lambda}(t)\\right)^2 \\, dt \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\tau 1^2 \\, dt \\right)\n$$\nLet's analyze each term in this inequality.\n\nThe term on the right-hand side is the product of the total excess work $W_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and the total duration $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\left( \\int_0^\\tau g(\\lambda(t)) \\dot{\\lambda}(t)^2 \\, dt \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\tau 1 \\, dt \\right) = W_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\cdot \\tau\n$$\n\nThe term on the left-hand side can be simplified by a change of variables from $t$ to $\\lambda$. Since $d\\lambda = \\dot{\\lambda}(t) dt$, the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\tau \\sqrt{g(\\lambda(t))} \\dot{\\lambda}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{\\lambda(0)}^{\\lambda(\\tau)} \\sqrt{g(\\lambda)} \\, d\\lambda = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{g(\\lambda)} \\, d\\lambda\n$$\nThis integral is precisely the definition of the thermodynamic length of the path in $\\lambda$-space, denoted by $\\mathcal{L}$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{g(\\lambda)} \\, d\\lambda\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^2 \\le W_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\cdot \\tau\n$$\nThis provides a lower bound for the excess work for any protocol $\\lambda(t)$ of duration $\\tau$:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\ge \\frac{\\mathcal{L}^2}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe minimum possible excess work, $W_{\\mathrm{min}}$, is this lower bound, which is achieved when the equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds. This occurs when $f(t) = c \\cdot h(t)$, which translates to:\n$$\n\\sqrt{g(\\lambda(t))} \\dot{\\lambda}(t) = c\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a constant. This condition dictates that the speed along the path, measured in the metric of thermodynamic length, $\\sqrt{g(\\lambda)} \\frac{d\\lambda}{dt}$, is constant. The constant $c$ can be determined by integrating this differential equation over the full duration:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{g(\\lambda)} \\, d\\lambda = \\int_0^\\tau c \\, dt \\implies \\mathcal{L} = c \\tau \\implies c = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe existence of a protocol satisfying this condition confirms that the minimum is achievable. Therefore, the minimal excess work is:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}^2}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\left( \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{g(\\lambda)} \\, d\\lambda \\right)^2\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the friction metric $g(\\lambda)$ and the total time $\\tau$, which are computable quantities from equilibrium properties and experimental setup, respectively, without needing to simulate the non-equilibrium process.\n\nNext, we derive the excess work for a constant-velocity protocol, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cv}}(t) = t/\\tau$. For this protocol, the velocity is constant: $\\dot{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{cv}}(t) = 1/\\tau$.\nThe excess work, $W_{\\mathrm{cv}}$, is calculated by substituting this protocol into the definition of $W_{\\mathrm{ex}}$:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{cv}} = \\int_0^\\tau g(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{cv}}(t)) \\dot{\\lambda}_{\\mathrm{cv}}(t)^2 \\, dt = \\int_0^\\tau g(t/\\tau) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)^2 \\, dt\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{cv}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau^2} \\int_0^\\tau g(t/\\tau) \\, dt\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we again perform a change of variables to $\\lambda = t/\\tau$. This gives $dt = \\tau \\, d\\lambda$, and the integration limits for $\\lambda$ are from $0$ to $1$.\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{cv}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau^2} \\int_0^1 g(\\lambda) (\\tau \\, d\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_0^1 g(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda\n$$\n\nIn summary, the two quantities to be calculated for each test case are:\n1. Minimal-dissipation excess work: $W_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\left( \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{g(\\lambda)} \\, d\\lambda \\right)^2$\n2.
