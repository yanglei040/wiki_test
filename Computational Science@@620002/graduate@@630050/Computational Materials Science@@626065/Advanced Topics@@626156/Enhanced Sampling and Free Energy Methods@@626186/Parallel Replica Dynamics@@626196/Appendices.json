In ParRep, the workflow is as follows: a dephasing stage of duration $\\tau_{d} > 0$ produces $N$ decorrelated and quasi-stationary initial conditions inside the metastable state; then a parallel stage runs $N$ independent replicas until the first exit event is detected; finally, the algorithm performs a synchronization and selection stage with overhead that scales linearly in $N$ with coefficient $\\tau_{s} > 0$, representing per-replica communication and coordination costs.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The serial exit time is exponential with rate $\\lambda$, with mean $1/\\lambda$.\n- The $N$ parallel replicas have independent and identically distributed exponential exit times with the same rate $\\lambda$, and the detection/selection stage stops all replicas upon the first exit.\n- The total expected ParRep wall-clock time for one statistically correct exit event is the sum of the dephasing time, the expected time until the first exit among the $N$ replicas, and the synchronization overhead that scales linearly with $N$ with coefficient $\\tau_{s}$.\n\nUsing only first principles of exponential waiting-time processes and independence, derive a closed-form expression for the expected speedup $\\mathbb{E}[S(N)]$, defined as the ratio of the expected serial time to the expected ParRep wall-clock time for a single exit event.

The expected value of such a variable is the reciprocal of its rate.\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[T_{serial}] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Expected ParRep Wall-Clock Time:** The total expected ParRep time, $\\mathbb{E}[T_{ParRep}(N)]$, is the sum of three components:\n    - The dephasing time, given as the constant $\\tau_d$.\n    - The expected time until the first exit event in the parallel stage. Let $T_1, T_2, \\ldots, T_N$ be the i.i.d. exit times for the $N$ replicas, each following an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$. The time for the parallel stage is $T_{parallel} = \\min(T_1, T_2, \\ldots, T_N)$. The minimum of $N$ i.i.d. exponential random variables with rate $\\lambda$ is itself an exponential random variable with a rate equal to the sum of the individual rates, which is $N\\lambda$.\n    The probability that a single replica $T_i$ has not exited by time $t$ is $P(T_i > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. Since the replicas are independent, the probability that none of them have exited by time $t$ is:\n    $$\n    P(T_{parallel} > t) = P(T_1 > t, \\ldots, T_N > t) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(T_i > t) = (\\exp(-\\lambda t))^N = \\exp(-N\\lambda t)\n    $$\n    This is the survival function of an exponential distribution with rate $N\\lambda$. The expected value of this distribution is:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[T_{parallel}] = \\frac{1}{N\\lambda}\n    $$\n    - The synchronization overhead, given as a linear function of $N$: $N\\tau_s$.\n\n    Combining these three components gives the total expected ParRep wall-clock time:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[T_{ParRep}(N)] = \\tau_d + \\mathbb{E}[T_{parallel}] + N\\tau_s = \\tau_d + \\frac{1}{N\\lambda} + N\\tau_s\n    $$\n\n3.  **Expected Speedup Expression:** The expected speedup $\\mathbb{E}[S(N)]$ is the ratio of the expected serial time to the expected ParRep time.\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[S(N)] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[T_{serial}]}{\\mathbb{E}[T_{ParRep}(N)]} = \\frac{1/\\lambda}{\\tau_d + \\frac{1}{N\\lambda} + N\\tau_s}\n    $$\n    To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $N\\lambda$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[S(N)] = \\frac{N\\lambda(1/\\lambda)}{N\\lambda(\\tau_d + \\frac{1}{N\\lambda} + N\\tau_s)} = \\frac{N}{N\\lambda\\tau_d + 1 + N^2\\lambda\\tau_s}\n    $$\n    This can be rearranged into a standard polynomial form in the denominator:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[S(N)] = \\frac{N}{N^2\\lambda\\tau_s + N\\lambda\\tau_d + 1}\n    $$\n    This is the first required result.\n\n**Part 2: Optimal Number of Replicas $N^{\\star}$**\n\nTo find the number of replicas $N^{\\star}$ that maximizes the speedup $\\mathbb{E}[S(N)]$, we treat $N$ as a continuous positive real variable and find the maximum of the function $\\mathbb{E}[S(N)]$. Maximizing $\\mathbb{E}[S(N)]$ is equivalent to minimizing its reciprocal multiplied by a constant, which simplifies to minimizing the denominator of the original fraction, $\\mathbb{E}[T_{ParRep}(N)]$. Let us define this function to be minimized as $f(N)$:\n$$\nf(N) = \\mathbb{E}[T_{ParRep}(N)] = \\tau_d + \\frac{1}{N\\lambda} + N\\tau_s\n$$\nWe find the critical points by taking the first derivative of $f(N)$ with respect to $N$ and setting it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dN} = \\frac{d}{dN} \\left( \\tau_d + \\frac{1}{N\\lambda} + N\\tau_s \\right) = 0 - \\frac{1}{N^2\\lambda} + \\tau_s\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\tau_s - \\frac{1}{N^2\\lambda} = 0 \\implies \\tau_s = \\frac{1}{N^2\\lambda}\n$$\nSolving for $N^2$:\n$$\nN^2 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda\\tau_s}\n$$\nSince $N$ must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$\nN^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\lambda\\tau_s}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda\\tau_s}}\n$$\nTo confirm that this value corresponds to a maximum for the speedup (i.e., a minimum for the time $f(N)$), we examine the second derivative of $f(N)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{dN^2} = \\frac{d}{dN} \\left( -\\frac{1}{N^2\\lambda} + \\tau_s \\right) = - \\left( \\frac{-2}{N^3\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{2}{N^3\\lambda}\n$$\nSince $\\lambda > 0$, $\\tau_s > 0$, the optimal $N^{\\star}$ is positive. Therefore, for any $N > 0$, we have $\\frac{d^2f}{dN^2} > 0$. This positive second derivative indicates that $f(N)$ is a convex function for $N>0$ and that $N^{\\star}$ corresponds to a local and global minimum for $f(N)$. Consequently, $N^{\\star}$ yields the maximum value for the speedup $\\mathbb{E}[S(N)]$.

In nondimensional units, take $D = 1$. The potential is specified as $U(x) = a x^6 - b x^4 + c x^2$, with parameters $a > 0$, $b > 0$, $c > 0$ chosen so that $U(x)$ has three local minima separated by two local maxima. This occurs when $b^2 > 3ac$. Define the computational domain as the interval $[-L, L]$, with $L > 0$ sufficiently large to capture the outer basins.\n\nA key assumption underlying Parallel Replica Dynamics (PRD) is the existence of a timescale separation between intra-basin mixing and inter-basin crossing: once the system enters a basin, it quickly relaxes to the quasi-stationary distribution before a rare transition event occurs to leave the basin. One way to validate this assumption is through committor functions. For a pair of disjoint boundaries $x_\\ell < x_r$, the committor function $q(x)$ is defined as the probability that a trajectory starting at position $x$ hits the boundary at $x_r$ before the boundary at $x_\\ell$.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n1. Construct the partition of the domain into basins using the local minima and local maxima of $U(x)$. Specifically:\n   - Compute all critical points of $U(x)$ by solving $U'(x) = 0$ and classify them by the sign of $U''(x)$ to identify local minima and local maxima.\n   - Let $x = 0$ be the central minimum (for $c > 0$). Using the remaining critical points, identify the left and right local minima at $x = -x_{\\min}$ and $x = +x_{\\min}$ and the left and right local maxima (saddles in one dimension) at $x = -x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$ and $x = +x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$, with $x_{\\mathrm{sad}} < x_{\\min}$.\n   - Define three basins as intervals: the left basin $[-L, -x_{\\mathrm{sad}}]$, the central basin $[-x_{\\mathrm{sad}}, +x_{\\mathrm{sad}}]$, and the right basin $[+x_{\\mathrm{sad}}, +L]$.\n\n2. For each basin, define an appropriate committor function consistent with the direction of an inter-basin crossing event:\n   - In the left basin, define $q_{\\mathrm{left}}(x)$ as the probability to hit $-x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$ before $-L$.\n   - In the central basin, define $q_{\\mathrm{center}}(x)$ as the probability to hit $+x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$ before $-x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$.\n   - In the right basin, define $p_{\\mathrm{right}}(x)$ as the probability to hit $+x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$ before $+L$.\n   In all cases, use the backward equation associated with the Langevin dynamics to compute these committor functions, with absorbing boundary conditions $q(x_\\ell) = 0$ and $q(x_r) = 1$ for the pair $(x_\\ell, x_r)$ relevant to the basin. Answer in nondimensional units.\n\n3. To validate that intra-basin mixing is fast relative to crossing events, quantify the sharpness of the committor transition layer within each basin by computing the width of the region in which the committor lies between the thresholds $0.1$ and $0.9$. Specifically, for each basin, compute the positions $x_{0.1}$ and $x_{0.9}$ at which the committor equals $0.1$ and $0.9$, respectively, and define the transition width as $w = x_{0.9} - x_{0.1}$. Define the basin width as $W = x_r - x_\\ell$. For the right basin, apply this to $p_{\\mathrm{right}}(x)$ rather than $q_{\\mathrm{right}}(x)$ so that the threshold interpretation is consistent with crossing toward the center. Report the ratio $r = w / W$ for each basin, and finally report, for each parameter set, the maximum of these three ratios across the basins. Small values of $r$ indicate a narrow transition region relative to basin size and hence fast intra-basin mixing relative to crossing.\n\n4.

It describes a standard physical model (Langevin dynamics in a multi-well potential) and uses established mathematical tools (committor functions, backward Fokker-Planck equation) to investigate a core concept in computational chemistry (timescale separation). The parameters and conditions are self-consistent and complete. For example, the condition $b^2 > 3ac$ ensures the existence of five distinct real critical points, which is necessary for a triple-well structure. The tasks are defined algorithmically and lead to a unique, computable solution. The only minor imprecision is in the definition of the transition width $w = x_{0.9} - x_{0.1}$ for the right basin, where the committor function $p_{\\mathrm{right}}(x)$ is decreasing. A literal interpretation would yield a negative width. The physically meaningful interpretation is that width is a positive quantity, i.e., $|x_{0.9} - x_{0.1}|$.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\nThe solution proceeds through a sequence of logical steps derived from the theory of stochastic processes.\n\n**1. Basin Identification**\n\nThe potential is given by $U(x) = a x^6 - b x^4 + c x^2$. The basins of attraction are separated by local maxima of the potential (saddle points in 1D). To find these, we first compute the critical points by solving $U'(x) = 0$:\n$$ U'(x) = 6ax^5 - 4bx^3 + 2cx = 2x(3ax^4 - 2bx^2 + c) = 0 $$\nOne critical point is $x=0$. The others are found by solving the quadratic equation in $x^2$: $3a(x^2)^2 - 2b(x^2) + c = 0$. The solutions for $x^2$ are:\n$$ x^2 = \\frac{2b \\pm \\sqrt{4b^2 - 12ac}}{6a} = \\frac{b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}}{3a} $$\nThe condition $b^2 > 3ac$ ensures two distinct, positive solutions for $x^2$. Let these be $x_{\\min}^2$ and $x_{\\mathrm{sad}}^2$. We classify them using the aign of the second derivative, $U''(x) = 30ax^4 - 12bx^2 + 2c$.\n- For $x^2 = x_{\\mathrm{sad}}^2 = \\frac{b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}}{3a}$, $U''(x) < 0$, corresponding to local maxima (saddles) at $\\pm x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$.\n- For $x=0$, $U''(0) = 2c > 0$, corresponding to the central local minimum.\n- For $x^2 = x_{\\min}^2 = \\frac{b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 3ac}}{3a}$, $U''(x) > 0$, corresponding to the side-well local minima at $\\pm x_{\\min}$.\nThe basins are then defined by the saddle points: Left: $\\left[-L, -x_{\\mathrm{sad}}\\right]$, Central: $\\left[-x_{\\mathrm{sad}}, +x_{\\mathrm{sad}}\\right]$, and Right: $\\left[+x_{\\mathrm{sad}}, L\\right]$.\n\n**2. Committor Function Solution**\n\nThe committor function $q(x)$ for a process on an interval $[x_\\ell, x_r]$ is governed by the backward equation, which for the given overdamped Langevin dynamics with $D=1$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2q}{dx^2} - \\beta U'(x) \\frac{dq}{dx} = 0 $$\nwith boundary conditions $q(x_\\ell) = 0$ and $q(x_r) = 1$. This is a second-order linear ODE. Letting $v(x) = q'(x)$, we get a first-order separable equation $v'(x) = \\beta U'(x) v(x)$, which solves to $v(x) = C_1 e^{\\beta U(x)}$. Integrating $q'(x)$ from $x_\\ell$ to $x$ and applying the boundary conditions yields the well-known solution:\n$$ q(x) = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\int_{x_\\ell}^{x} e^{\\beta U(y)} \\,dy}{\\displaystyle \\int_{x_\\ell}^{x_r} e^{\\beta U(y)} \\,dy} $$\nThis formula applies directly to $q_{\\mathrm{left}}(x)$ and $q_{\\mathrm{center}}(x)$. For the right basin, the committor $p_{\\mathrm{right}}(x)$ is the probability to reach $+x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$ before $+L$. This corresponds to setting $x_\\ell = +L$ and $x_r = +x_{\\mathrm{sad}}$, resulting in $p_{\\mathrm{right}}(+L)=0$ and $p_{\\mathrm{right}}(+x_{\\mathrm{sad}})=1$. The solution is:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{right}}(x) = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\int_{+L}^{x} e^{\\beta U(y)} \\,dy}{\\displaystyle \\int_{+L}^{+x_{\\mathrm{sad}}} e^{\\beta U(y)} \\,dy} = 1 - \\frac{\\displaystyle \\int_{+x_{\\mathrm{sad}}}^{x} e^{\\beta U(y)} \\,dy}{\\displaystyle \\int_{+x_{\\mathrm{sad}}}^{+L} e^{\\beta U(y)} \\,dy} $$\n\n**3. Numerical Implementation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the ratio $r = w/W$ for each basin. This requires finding the positions $x_{0.1}$ and $x_{0.9}$ for each committor.\nFor an increasing committor $q(x)$, we must solve $q(x) = 0.1$ and $q(x) = 0.9$. This is equivalent to solving for $x$ in:\n$$ \\int_{x_\\ell}^{x} e^{\\beta U(y)} \\,dy = C \\cdot \\int_{x_\\ell}^{x_r} e^{\\beta U(y)} \\,dy $$\nwhere $C$ is $0.1$ or $0.9$. This is a root-finding problem.\n\nA significant numerical challenge arises from the term $e^{\\beta U(y)}$. For large $\\beta$ or large $|x|$, this term can cause floating-point overflow. We circumvent this by noting that the committor formula is a ratio. We can shift the potential by a constant $U_0$ without changing the result:\n$$ q(x) = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\int_{x_\\ell}^{x} e^{\\beta (U(y)-U_0)} \\,dy}{\\displaystyle \\int_{x_\\ell}^{x_r} e^{\\beta (U(y)-U_0)} \\,dy} $$\nBy choosing $U_0$ as the minimum value of $U(y)$ in the interval $[x_\\ell, x_r]$, we ensure that the exponent $\\beta(U(y)-U_0)$ is always non-negative and its minimum is $0$. This maximizes numerical stability.\n\nThe overall algorithm for each basin is:\n1. Define the basin boundaries $(x_\\ell, x_r)$.\n2. Find the minimum of the potential $U_0 = \\min_{y \\in [x_\\ell, x_r]} U(y)$ using a numerical optimization routine.\n3. Define the stabilized integrand $f(y) = e^{\\beta(U(y)-U_0)}$.\n4. Compute the total integral $I_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\int_{x_\\ell}^{x_r} f(y) \\,dy$ using numerical quadrature.\n5. Solve for $x_{0.1}$ and $x_{0.9}$ by finding the roots of the equations $\\int_{x_\\ell}^{x} f(y) \\,dy - C \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0$ for $C=0.1$ and $C=0.9$ using a numerical root-finder.\n6.

You will derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the escape rate, leveraging a remarkable property of ParRep that ensures the statistically corrected data follows the original, unaccelerated probability distribution.", "problem": "Consider a metastable basin in a potential energy landscape at fixed temperature, where the exit event from the basin is rare on the timescale of local equilibration. Assume the exit time of the original, unaccelerated dynamics is a positive, continuous random variable $T$ with a constant hazard rate $k>0$, meaning $h(t)=k$ for all $t\\geq 0$, where $h(t)$ is the instantaneous rate of exit conditional on survival up to time $t$. Under ideal Parallel Replica Dynamics (ParRep), after a decorrelation and dephasing stage, $N$ independent replicas are launched from the local equilibrium within the basin. Let $T^{(1)},\\dots,T^{(N)}$ denote the independent exit times of the replicas, and let $T_{\\min}=\\min\\{T^{(1)},\\dots,T^{(N)}\\}$ denote the earliest exit among the replicas.

The assumption of a constant hazard rate corresponds to an exponential distribution of waiting times for a rare event, a cornerstone of transition state theory. The description of Parallel Replica Dynamics is consistent with the established literature on accelerated molecular dynamics methods.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the derivation of a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and its asymptotic variance, which are standard procedures in statistical inference.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires a multi-step derivation, beginning with the probability distribution of the exit times and culminating in the calculation of the estimator's variance.\n\n**1. Distribution of the Unaccelerated Exit Time $T$**\nThe hazard rate function $h(t)$ is related to the probability density function (PDF) $f_T(t)$ and the survivor function $S_T(t) = P(T > t)$ by $h(t) = f_T(t) / S_T(t)$. The survivor function can be derived from the hazard rate:\n$$S_T(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t h(u) \\, du\\right)$$\nGiven $h(t) = k$, a constant, we have:\n$$S_T(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t k \\, du\\right) = \\exp(-kt)$$\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F_T(t) = 1 - S_T(t) = 1 - \\exp(-kt)$. The PDF is the derivative of the CDF:\n$$f_T(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} F_T(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (1 - \\exp(-kt)) = k \\exp(-kt)$$\nThis is the PDF for an exponential distribution with rate parameter $k$, denoted as $T \\sim \\text{Exp}(k)$. The mean of this distribution is $E[T] = 1/k$.\n\n**2. Distribution of the Minimum Exit Time $T_{\\min}$**\nThe variable $T_{\\min}$ is the minimum of $N$ i.i.d. random variables $T^{(j)}$, each distributed as $\\text{Exp}(k)$. The survivor function of $T_{\\min}$ is:\n$$S_{T_{\\min}}(t) = P(T_{\\min} > t) = P(T^{(1)} > t, T^{(2)} > t, \\ldots, T^{(N)} > t)$$\nDue to independence, this becomes:\n$$S_{T_{\\min}}(t) = \\prod_{j=1}^{N} P(T^{(j)} > t) = (S_T(t))^N = (\\exp(-kt))^N = \\exp(-Nkt)$$\nThe PDF of $T_{\\min}$ is found by first obtaining its CDF, $F_{T_{\\min}}(t) = 1 - S_{T_{\\min}}(t) = 1 - \\exp(-Nkt)$, and then differentiating:\n$$f_{T_{\\min}}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (1 - \\exp(-Nkt)) = Nk \\exp(-Nkt)$$\nThus, $T_{\\min}$ follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $Nk$, i.e., $T_{\\min} \\sim \\text{Exp}(Nk)$.\n\n**3. Distribution of the Accelerated Time $T_{\\mathrm{acc}}$**\nThe accelerated time is defined as $T_{\\mathrm{acc}} = N T_{\\min}$. To find its distribution, we use the method of transformations. Let $Y = T_{\\mathrm{acc}}$ and $X = T_{\\min}$. We have $Y = NX$. The CDF of $Y$ is:\n$$F_Y(y) = P(Y \\le y) = P(NX \\le y) = P(X \\le y/N) = F_{T_{\\min}}(y/N)$$\nSubstituting the CDF of $T_{\\min}$:\n$$F_Y(y) = 1 - \\exp(-Nk(y/N)) = 1 - \\exp(-ky)$$\nThe PDF of $T_{\\mathrm{acc}}$ is the derivative of its CDF:\n$$f_{T_{\\mathrm{acc}}}(y) = \\frac{d}{dy} (1 - \\exp(-ky)) = k \\exp(-ky)$$\nThis demonstrates that $T_{\\mathrm{acc}}$ follows the same distribution as the original, unaccelerated exit time $T$, i.e., $T_{\\mathrm{acc}} \\sim \\text{Exp}(k)$. The problem data consist of $m$ i.i.d. samples $\\{T_{\\mathrm{acc},i}\\}_{i=1}^{m}$ from this distribution.\n\n**4. Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for $k$**\nLet the observed data be $\\{t_i\\}_{i=1}^{m}$, where $t_i = T_{\\mathrm{acc},i}$. The likelihood function $L(k)$ for these data is the product of the individual probability densities:\n$$L(k \\mid \\{t_i\\}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} f_{T_{\\mathrm{acc}}}(t_i; k) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} k \\exp(-kt_i) = k^m \\exp\\left(-k \\sum_{i=1}^{m} t_i\\right)$$\nIt is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(k) = \\ln L(k)$:\n$$\\ell(k) = \\ln\\left(k^m \\exp\\left(-k \\sum_{i=1}^{m} t_i\\right)\\right) = m \\ln(k) - k \\sum_{i=1}^{m} t_i$$\nTo find the MLE, $\\hat{k}$, we differentiate $\\ell(k)$ with respect to $k$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell(k)}{dk} = \\frac{m}{k} - \\sum_{i=1}^{m} t_i = 0$$\nSolving for $k$ gives the estimator $\\hat{k}$:\n$$\\frac{m}{\\hat{k}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} t_i \\implies \\hat{k} = \\frac{m}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} t_i}$$\nRe-substituting $T_{\\mathrm{acc},i}$ for $t_i$, the MLE is:\n$$\\hat{k} = \\frac{m}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} T_{\\mathrm{acc},i}}$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\ell(k)}{dk^2} = -\\frac{m}{k^2}$$\nSince $m > 0$ and $k^2 > 0$, the second derivative is always negative, confirming that $\\hat{k}$ maximizes the likelihood.\n\n**5. Asymptotic Variance of $\\hat{k}$**\nThe asymptotic variance of an MLE is given by the inverse of the Fisher information. The Fisher information for $m$ i.i.d. samples, $I_m(k)$, is $m$ times the Fisher information for a single sample, $I_1(k)$.\n$$I_1(k) = -E\\left[\\frac{d^2}{dk^2} \\ln f(t; k)\\right]$$\nThe log-likelihood for a single observation $t$ from $\\text{Exp}(k)$ is $\\ln(k) - kt$.\nThe second derivative with respect to $k$ is:\n$$\\frac{d^2}{dk^2} (\\ln(k) - kt) = -\\frac{1}{k^2}$$\nThis expression is a constant with respect to the random variable $t$, so its expectation is the value itself:\n$$I_1(k) = -E\\left[-\\frac{1}{k^2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{k^2}$$\nThe total Fisher information for $m$ samples is:\n$$I_m(k) = m \\cdot I_1(k) = \\frac{m}{k^2}$$\nThe asymptotic variance of the MLE $\\hat{k}$ is the reciprocal of the total Fisher information (the Cramér-Rao lower bound, which is achieved by the MLE asymptotically):\n$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{k}) \\approx \\frac{1}{I_m(k)} = \\frac{1}{m/k^2} = \\frac{k^2}{m}$$\nThis is the asymptotic variance of the estimator.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the MLE $\\hat{k}$ and its asymptotic variance.\n- MLE: $\\hat{k} = \\frac{m}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} T_{\\mathrm{acc},i}}$\n- Asymptotic Variance: $\\frac{k^2}{m}$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{m}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} T_{\\mathrm{acc},i}} & \\frac{k^2}{m} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3473198"}]}
