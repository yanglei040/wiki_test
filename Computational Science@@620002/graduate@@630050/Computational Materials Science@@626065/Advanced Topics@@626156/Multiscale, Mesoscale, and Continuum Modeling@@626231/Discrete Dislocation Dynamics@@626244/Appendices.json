We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of a straight screw dislocation aligned with the $z$-axis in an isotropic, linear elastic medium. This scenario is one of antiplane shear, where the only non-zero component of the displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}$ is $u_z$, and it is a function of the in-plane coordinates $(x,y)$ only, i.e., $u_z = u_z(x,y)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the classical Volterra stress field. For a screw dislocation with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = (0, 0, b)$, the displacement field is multivalued and given in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$ by\n$$\nu_z(r,\\theta) = \\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\theta\n$$\nThe non-zero strain components in antiplane shear are $\\epsilon_{rz}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\theta z}$.

The problem states that this is achieved by smoothing the two-dimensional Green's function of the Laplacian. In dislocation theory, this is often formulated using a stress function $\\phi(x,y)$ such that $\\tau_{xz} = \\partial \\phi / \\partial y$ and $\\tau_{yz} = -\\partial \\phi / \\partial x$.

Their unit normal vectors, $\\mathbf{n}_1$ and $\\mathbf{n}_2$, are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\| [1,-1,0] \\|} [1,-1,0] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2+0^2}} [1,-1,0] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[1,-1,0]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_2 = \\frac{1}{\\| [1,0,-1] \\|} [1,0,-1] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2+0^2+(-1)^2}} [1,0,-1] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[1,0,-1]\n$$\nNote that $\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_1 = 0$ and $\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_2 = 0$, confirming that the dislocation line lies in both planes.\n\nFor each plane $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$, an in-plane direction orthogonal to $\\mathbf{s}$ is defined by the unit vector $\\mathbf{p}_j$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}_j = \\frac{\\mathbf{n}_j \\times \\mathbf{s}}{\\| \\mathbf{n}_j \\times \\mathbf{s} \\|}\n$$\nFor plane $1$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_1 \\times \\mathbf{s} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}[-1, -1, 2]\n$$\nThe norm is $\\| \\mathbf{n}_1 \\times \\mathbf{s} \\| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\sqrt{(-1)^2+(-1)^2+2^2} = 1$. Thus, $\\mathbf{p}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}[-1, -1, 2]$.\nFor plane $2$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_2 \\times \\mathbf{s} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}[1, -2, 1]\n$$\nThe norm is $\\| \\mathbf{n}_2 \\times \\mathbf{s} \\| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\sqrt{1^2+(-2)^2+1^2} = 1$. Thus, $\\mathbf{p}_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}[1, -2, 1]$.\n\n**2. Loading Conditions**\nA uniaxial stress of magnitude $\\sigma_0$ is applied along the direction of a unit vector $\\mathbf{u}(\\theta)$. This vector is constructed by rotating in the plane spanned by $\\mathbf{s}$ and a specific orthogonal vector $\\mathbf{p}_0$. The problem defines $\\mathbf{p}_0$ to be along the normalized direction of $\\mathbf{n}_1 \\times \\mathbf{s}$, which is precisely $\\mathbf{p}_1$. So, $\\mathbf{p}_0 = \\mathbf{p}_1$. The basis vectors for rotation, $\\mathbf{s}$ and $\\mathbf{p}_0$, are orthonormal.\nThe loading direction is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta)\\,\\mathbf{s} + (\\sin\\theta)\\,\\mathbf{p}_0\n$$\nAs $\\mathbf{s}$ and $\\mathbf{p}_0$ are orthonormal, $\\| \\mathbf{u}(\\theta) \\|^2 = \\cos^2\\theta \\|\\mathbf{s}\\|^2 + \\sin^2\\theta \\|\\mathbf{p}_0\\|^2 = \\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1$, so $\\mathbf{u}(\\theta)$ is a unit vector. The stress tensor is given by the outer product:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\sigma_0\\,\\mathbf{u}(\\theta)\\otimes\\mathbf{u}(\\theta)\n$$\n\n**3. Stress Analysis on Slip Planes**\nThe traction vector on a plane $j$ with normal $\\mathbf{n}_j$ is $\\mathbf{t}_j = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_j$. Using the expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t}_j = \\sigma_0 (\\mathbf{u}(\\theta)\\otimes\\mathbf{u}(\\theta)) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j = \\sigma_0 \\mathbf{u}(\\theta) (\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)\n$$\nThe stress components—normal traction $t_j^{n}$, parallel shear $\\tau_j^{\\parallel}$, and perpendicular shear $\\tau_j^{\\perp}$—are projections of this traction.\n$$\nt_j^{n} = \\mathbf{n}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{t}_j = \\sigma_0 (\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)^2\n$$\nThe in-plane shear traction is $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_j = \\mathbf{t}_j - t_j^n \\mathbf{n}_j$. Its components are:\n$$\n\\tau_j^{\\parallel} = \\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_j = \\mathbf{s} \\cdot (\\mathbf{t}_j - t_j^n \\mathbf{n}_j) = \\sigma_0 (\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j) (\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}(\\theta)) - t_j^n (\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_j^{\\perp} = \\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_j = \\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot (\\mathbf{t}_j - t_j^n \\mathbf{n}_j) = \\sigma_0 (\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j) (\\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{u}(\\theta)) - t_j^n (\\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j = 0$ and $\\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j = 0$ by construction, these simplify to:\n$$\n\\tau_j^{\\parallel} = \\sigma_0 (\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j) (\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}(\\theta))\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_j^{\\perp} = \\sigma_0 (\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j) (\\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{u}(\\theta))\n$$\nThe dot products involving $\\mathbf{u}(\\theta)$ are evaluated using its definition $\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) = (\\cos\\theta)\\mathbf{s} + (\\sin\\theta)\\mathbf{p}_0$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j = \\cos\\theta(\\mathbf{s}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_j) + \\sin\\theta(\\mathbf{p}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_j) = \\sin\\theta(\\mathbf{p}_0\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_j)$\n    \\item $\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta(\\mathbf{s}\\cdot\\mathbf{s}) + \\sin\\theta(\\mathbf{s}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_0) = \\cos\\theta$\n    \\item $\\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{u}(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta(\\mathbf{p}_j\\cdot\\mathbf{s}) + \\sin\\theta(\\mathbf{p}_j\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_0) = \\sin\\theta(\\mathbf{p}_j\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_0)$\n\\end{itemize}\nSubstituting these into the component expressions:\n$$\nt_j^n = \\sigma_0 \\sin^2\\theta (\\mathbf{p}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_j^{\\parallel} = \\sigma_0 (\\sin\\theta (\\mathbf{p}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)) (\\cos\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_0 \\sin(2\\theta) (\\mathbf{p}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_j^{\\perp} = \\sigma_0 (\\sin\\theta (\\mathbf{p}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j)) (\\sin\\theta (\\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_0)) = \\sigma_0 \\sin^2\\theta (\\mathbf{p}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j) (\\mathbf{p}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_0)\n$$\nThe required dot products are: $\\mathbf{p}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_1 = 0$, $\\mathbf{p}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_2 = -3/\\sqrt{12} = -\\sqrt{3}/2$, $\\mathbf{p}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_0 = 1$, and $\\mathbf{p}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_0 = 1/2$.\nFor plane 1 ($j=1$), since $\\mathbf{p}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_1 = 0$, all stress components are zero:\n$$\nt_1^n = 0, \\quad \\tau_1^{\\parallel} = 0, \\quad \\tau_1^{\\perp} = 0\n$$\nFor plane 2 ($j=2$):\n$$\nt_2^n = \\sigma_0 \\sin^2\\theta (-\\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = \\frac{3}{4} \\sigma_0 \\sin^2\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_2^{\\parallel} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_0 \\sin(2\\theta) (-\\sqrt{3}/2) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\sigma_0 \\sin(2\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_2^{\\perp} = \\sigma_0 \\sin^2\\theta (-\\sqrt{3}/2) (1/2) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\sigma_0 \\sin^2\\theta\n$$\n\n**4. Effective Stress and Activation Energy**\nThe Maximum Resolved Shear Stress (MRSS) is:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{MRSS}} = \\max(|\\tau_1^{\\parallel}|, |\\tau_2^{\\parallel}|) = \\max(0, |-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\sigma_0 \\sin(2\\theta)|) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\sigma_0 |\\sin(2\\theta)|\n$$\nThe augmented effective stress for each plane is $\\tau^{\\mathrm{eff}}_j = \\tau_{\\mathrm{MRSS}} + k_1\\,\\tau_j^{\\perp} + k_2\\,t_j^{n}$.\nFor plane 1:\n$$\n\\tau_1^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{MRSS}} + k_1(0) + k_2(0) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\sigma_0 |\\sin(2\\theta)|\n$$\nFor plane 2:\n$$\n\\tau_2^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{MRSS}} + k_1 \\tau_2^{\\perp} + k_2 t_2^n = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\sigma_0 |\\sin(2\\theta)| + k_1(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\sigma_0 \\sin^2\\theta) + k_2(\\frac{3}{4} \\sigma_0 \\sin^2\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_2^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{4} \\left( \\sqrt{3} |\\sin(2\\theta)| + (3k_2 - \\sqrt{3}k_1) \\sin^2\\theta \\right)\n$$\nThe activation free energy for cross-slip on plane $j$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta G_j = \\max(\\Delta G_{\\min}, \\Delta G_0 - V|\\tau_j^{\\mathrm{eff}}|)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_0$ is the zero-stress energy barrier, $V$ is the activation volume, and $\\Delta G_{\\min}$ is a lower bound. The numerical values for these constants are provided in the problem statement. Specifically, $b = 2.48\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $V = 5b^3$, $\\Delta G_0 = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and $\\Delta G_{\\min} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Units must be consistent (SI units). The conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$ is used.\n\n**5. Cross-Slip Rate and Selection Proxy**\nThe cross-slip rate follows an Arrhenius-type law:\n$$\nR_j = \\nu_0\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_j}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_0$ is the attempt frequency, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The plane-selection proxy $r$ is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} = \\frac{\\nu_0\\,\\exp(-\\Delta G_1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T))}{\\nu_0\\,\\exp(-\\Delta G_1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)) + \\nu_0\\,\\exp(-\\Delta G_2/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T))}\n$$\nThis simplifies to a logistic function of the energy difference:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_1 - \\Delta G_2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)}\n$$\nIf $\\sigma_0 = 0$, then $\\tau_1^{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\tau_2^{\\mathrm{eff}}=0$, leading to $\\Delta G_1 = \\Delta G_2 = \\Delta G_0$, and thus $r = 1/(1+e^0) = 0.5$.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case $(\\sigma_0, T, k_1, k_2, \\theta)$ is to calculate $\\tau_1^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\\tau_2^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, then $\\Delta G_1$ and $\\Delta G_2$, and finally $r$ using the formulas above.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the cross-slip plane-selection proxy for a series of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Physical constants\n    E_CHARGE = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in Coulombs, for eV to J conversion\n    B_MAG = 2.48e-10  # Burgers vector magnitude in m\n    V_ACT = 5 * B_MAG**3  # Activation volume in m^3\n    DG0 = 1.20 * E_CHARGE  # Zero-stress activation free energy in J\n    DG_MIN = 0.02 * E_CHARGE  # Minimum activation free energy in J\n    KB = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n    # Test suite: (sigma_0, T, k1, k2, theta)\n    test_cases = [\n        (6.00e8, 300, 0.20, -0.05, 0.0),            # Pa, K, dimensionless, dimensionless, rad\n        (6.00e8, 300, 0.20, -0.05, np.pi/6),\n        (6.00e8, 300, 0.20, -0.05, np.pi/3),\n        (6.00e8, 300, 0.20, -0.05, np.pi/2),\n        (0.0,    300, 0.20, -0.05, np.pi/4),\n        (6.00e8, 950, 0.50,  0.30, np.pi/6),\n        (6.00e8, 300, -0.30, -0.20, np.pi/6),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        sigma_0, T, k1, k2, theta = case\n\n        # Handle the trivial case of zero applied stress\n        if sigma_0 == 0.0:\n            results.append(0.5)\n            continue\n\n        # Calculate trigonometric terms\n        sin_theta = np.sin(theta)\n        sin_2theta = np.sin(2 * theta)\n\n        # Calculate effective stresses for plane 1 and plane 2\n        # tau_eff_1 depends only on the Maximum Resolved Shear Stress (MRSS)\n        tau_eff_1 = (np.sqrt(3) / 4) * sigma_0 * np.abs(sin_2theta)\n\n        # tau_eff_2 has additional non-Schmid contributions\n        tau_mrss = tau_eff_1\n        non_schmid_term = (3 * k2 - np.sqrt(3) * k1) * sin_theta**2\n        tau_eff_2 = (sigma_0 / 4) * (np.sqrt(3) * np.abs(sin_2theta) + non_schmid_term)\n\n        # Calculate activation free energies for each plane\n        # Delta G = max(G_min, G0 - V * |tau_eff|)\n        delta_g1 = max(DG_MIN, DG0 - V_ACT * np.abs(tau_eff_1))\n        delta_g2 = max(DG_MIN, DG0 - V_ACT * np.abs(tau_eff_2))\n\n        # Calculate the plane-selection proxy r\n        # r = 1 / (1 + exp((G1 - G2) / (kT)))\n        kBT = KB * T\n        if kBT == 0:  # Avoid division by zero, although T is always positive here\n            #\n            # The limit depends on the sign of (delta_g1 - delta_g2).\n            # If G1 > G2, exp -> inf, r -> 0.\n            # If G1 < G2, exp -> 0, r -> 1.\n            # If G1 = G2, r -> 0.5.\n            if delta_g1 > delta_g2:\n                r = 0.0\n            elif delta_g1 < delta_g2:\n                r = 1.0\n            else:\n                r = 0.5\n        else:\n            exponent = (delta_g1 - delta_g2) / kBT\n            # Guard against overflow in exp\n            if exponent > np.log(np.finfo(float).max):\n                 r = 0.0\n            else:\n                 r = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(exponent))\n        \n        results.append(r)\n\n    # Format the final output string\n    output_str = f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3445349"}]}
