Pairwise interactions are truncated by an isotropic cutoff distance $r_c$, meaning that two particles interact only if the Euclidean norm of the displacement vector chosen to represent their separation is strictly less than $r_c$. Under the Minimum Image Convention (MIC), the displacement vector used to compute interactions is defined as the unique lattice-translated vector with components folded into the half-open interval $(-L_\\alpha/2, L_\\alpha/2]$ along each axis $\\alpha \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$ and with minimal Euclidean norm among all periodic images.\n\nStarting from the geometric structure of the periodic lattice and the definition of the MIC mapping, derive the maximal dimensionless cutoff ratio $$R \\equiv \\frac{r_c}{\\min(L_x,L_y,L_z)}$$ for which the MIC yields a unique nearest image for every pair of particles, for all possible configurations in the box.

The positions of particles are defined within this primary box. Due to Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC), the system is effectively infinite, consisting of periodic replicas of the primary box tiled in all three dimensions. The locations of these replicas are described by lattice vectors $\\mathbf{n}$, where $\\mathbf{n} = (k_x L_x, k_y L_y, k_z L_z)$ for integers $k_x, k_y, k_z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nConsider two particles, Particle $1$ at position $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and Particle $2$ at position $\\mathbf{r}_2$. The raw displacement vector is $\\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$. Due to PBC, Particle $2$ has an infinite set of periodic images at positions $\\mathbf{r}_2 + \\mathbf{n}$. The displacement vector from Particle $1$ to any image of Particle $2$ is given by $\\mathbf{d}' = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1 + \\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} + \\mathbf{n}$.\n\nThe problem states that pairwise interactions are considered only if the distance between a pair of particles, represented by a chosen displacement vector, is strictly less than the cutoff distance $r_c$. The question here concerns the uniqueness of the \"nearest image\". This is interpreted as the condition that for any given pair of particles, there cannot be two or more distinct periodic images whose separation from the reference particle is strictly less than $r_c$.\n\nLet us analyze the condition for having two distinct images of Particle $2$ lying within the cutoff sphere centered at Particle $1$. Let these two images correspond to lattice vectors $\\mathbf{n}_A$ and $\\mathbf{n}_B$, where $\\mathbf{n}_A \\neq \\mathbf{n}_B$. The displacement vectors from Particle $1$ to these two images are $\\mathbf{d}_A = \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} + \\mathbf{n}_A$ and $\\mathbf{d}_B = \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} + \\mathbf{n}_B$. The condition for both being within the cutoff distance is:\n$$\\|\\mathbf{d}_A\\|  r_c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\|\\mathbf{d}_B\\|  r_c$$\n\nThe vector connecting these two distinct images of Particle $2$ is $\\mathbf{d}_B - \\mathbf{d}_A = (\\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} + \\mathbf{n}_B) - (\\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} + \\mathbf{n}_A) = \\mathbf{n}_B - \\mathbf{n}_A$. Let $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{diff}} = \\mathbf{n}_B - \\mathbf{n}_A$. Since $\\mathbf{n}_A \\neq \\mathbf{n}_B$, $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{diff}}$ is a non-zero lattice vector. By the triangle inequality, the distance between these two images is:\n$$\\|\\mathbf{d}_B - \\mathbf{d}_A\\| = \\|\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{diff}}\\| \\le \\|\\mathbf{d}_B\\| + \\|(-\\mathbf{d}_A)\\| = \\|\\mathbf{d}_B\\| + \\|\\mathbf{d}_A\\|$$\nIf both images are strictly within the cutoff sphere, we have $\\|\\mathbf{d}_A\\|  r_c$ and $\\|\\mathbf{d}_B\\|  r_c$. Substituting these into the inequality gives:\n$$\\|\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{diff}}\\|  r_c + r_c = 2r_c$$\n\nThe set of all lattice vectors is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (k_x L_x, k_y L_y, k_z L_z)$ with $k_x, k_y, k_z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The squared norm of a lattice vector is $\\|\\mathbf{n}\\|^2 = (k_x L_x)^2 + (k_y L_y)^2 + (k_z L_z)^2$. The shortest non-zero lattice vector corresponds to setting one of the integers $\\{k_x, k_y, k_z\\}$ to $\\pm 1$ and the other two to $0$. The lengths of these vectors are $L_x, L_y, L_z$. The length of the shortest non-zero lattice vector in the orthorhombic system is therefore $L_{\\text{min}} = \\min(L_x, L_y, L_z)$.\n\nSince $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{diff}}$ is a non-zero lattice vector, its length must be at least $L_{\\text{min}}$:\n$$\\|\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{diff}}\\| \\ge L_{\\text{min}}$$\nCombining this with the inequality derived from the cutoff condition, we get:\n$$L_{\\text{min}} \\le \\|\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{diff}}\\|  2r_c \\implies L_{\\text{min}}  2r_c \\implies r_c > \\frac{L_{\\text{min}}}{2}$$\nThis shows that a necessary condition for two images to fall within the cutoff sphere is $r_c > L_{\\text{min}}/2$. The contrapositive statement is that if $r_c \\le L_{\\text{min}}/2$, it is impossible for two distinct periodic images to both be strictly within the cutoff distance $r_c$. This establishes that the condition $r_c \\le L_{\\text{min}}/2$ is **sufficient** to guarantee a unique image within the cutoff sphere (if any exists).\n\nNext, we must establish if this bound is also **necessary**. To do this, we must show that if the condition is violated, i.e., if $r_c > L_{\\text{min}}/2$, there exists at least one configuration of two particles for which uniqueness fails.\nLet us assume $r_c > L_{\\text{min}}/2$. Without loss of generality, let $L_x = L_{\\text{min}}$, so $r_c > L_x/2$. We need to construct a particle pair configuration $(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2)$ for which two distinct images of Particle $2$ are at a distance less than $r_c$ from Particle $1$.\n\nLet Particle $1$ be at the origin, $\\mathbf{r}_1 = (0,0,0)$. Let us place Particle $2$ such that its position in the primary cell is $\\mathbf{r}_2 = (L_x/2, 0, 0)$. The raw displacement is thus $\\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} = (L_x/2, 0, 0)$.\n\nNow we examine the distances from Particle $1$ to two different periodic images of Particle $2$:\n1.  The image in the primary cell, corresponding to the lattice vector $\\mathbf{n}_A = (0,0,0)$. The displacement vector is $\\mathbf{d}_A = \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} + \\mathbf{n}_A = (L_x/2, 0, 0)$. The distance is $\\|\\mathbf{d}_A\\| = L_x/2$.\n2.  The image in the adjacent cell along the negative $x$-axis, corresponding to the lattice vector $\\mathbf{n}_B = (-L_x, 0, 0)$. The displacement vector is $\\mathbf{d}_B = \\mathbf{d}_{\\text{raw}} + \\mathbf{n}_B = (L_x/2 - L_x, 0, 0) = (-L_x/2, 0, 0)$. The distance is $\\|\\mathbf{d}_B\\| = L_x/2$.\n\nAccording to our assumption, $r_c > L_x/2$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\\|\\mathbf{d}_A\\| = L_x/2  r_c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\|\\mathbf{d}_B\\| = L_x/2  r_c$$\nThis demonstrates that for the configuration with $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2=(L_x/2,0,0)$, two distinct periodic images of Particle $2$ lie strictly within the cutoff ball of radius $r_c$ centered on Particle $1$. This violates the uniqueness condition.\n\nSince for any $r_c > L_{\\text{min}}/2$ we can construct a counterexample, the condition $r_c \\le L_{\\text{min}}/2$ is also **necessary** to guarantee uniqueness for all possible particle configurations.\n\nThus, the maximal value of the cutoff radius for which the uniqueness of the nearest image is guaranteed is $r_{c,\\text{max}} = L_{\\text{min}}/2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximal dimensionless cutoff ratio $R$:\n$$R \\equiv \\frac{r_c}{\\min(L_x,L_y,L_z)} = \\frac{r_c}{L_{\\text{min}}}$$\nSubstituting the maximal value of $r_c$:\n$$R_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{r_{c,\\text{max}}}{L_{\\text{min}}} = \\frac{L_{\\text{min}}/2}{L_{\\text{min}}} = \\frac{1}{2}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3435139"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the theory behind the Minimum Image Convention is essential, but seeing its direct impact on physical observables provides a deeper appreciation for its importance.

This is achieved by setting each component $m_k$ of the integer vector $\\mathbf{m}$ to the negative of the nearest integer to the corresponding component $s_k$:\n$$\nm_k = -\\mathrm{round}(s_k)\n$$\nFor our fractional vector $\\mathbf{s}$:\n- $m_1 = -\\mathrm{round}(-0.075) = -0 = 0$\n- $m_2 = -\\mathrm{round}(-0.8125) = -(-1) = 1$\n- $m_3 = -\\mathrm{round}(0.05) = -0 = 0$\nSo, the integer vector for the translation is $\\mathbf{m} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\nThe wrapped fractional vector, $\\mathbf{s}' = \\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{m}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}' = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.075 \\\\ -0.8125 \\\\ 0.05 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.075 \\\\ 0.1875 \\\\ 0.05 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we convert this minimum image fractional vector back to Cartesian coordinates to obtain the minimum image separation vector $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{min}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{min}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{s}' = \\begin{pmatrix} 10  4  0 \\\\ 0  8  0 \\\\ 0  0  10 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.075 \\\\ 0.1875 \\\\ 0.05 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 10(-0.075) + 4(0.1875) \\\\ 8(0.1875) \\\\ 10(0.05) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.75 + 0.75 \\\\ 1.5 \\\\ 0.5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1.5 \\\\ 0.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe corrected minimum image distance is the Euclidean norm of this vector:\n$$\nd_{\\text{min}} = \\|\\Delta\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{min}}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{0^2 + (1.5)^2 + (0.5)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 2.25 + 0.25} = \\sqrt{2.5}\n$$\nThe numerical value is $d_{\\text{min}} \\approx 1.5811388...$ Å. Rounding to four significant figures gives $1.581$ Å. This distance is significantly smaller than the one obtained by the naive method, illustrating the importance of the correct procedure.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.581} $$", "id": "3435070"}]}
