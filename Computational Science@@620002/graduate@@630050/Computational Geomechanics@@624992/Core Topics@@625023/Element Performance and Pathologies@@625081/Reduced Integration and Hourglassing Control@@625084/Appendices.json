According to the principle of virtual work for conservative systems, the nodal forces are the negative partial derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the corresponding generalized coordinates, which are the nodal displacements $u_{x,i}$.\n\nThe stabilization energy is given by:\n$$\nW_{hg} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta q^2\n$$\nThe hourglass nodal force for the $x$-component of displacement at node $i$ is:\n$$\nf^{hg}_{x,i} = -\\frac{\\partial W_{hg}}{\\partial u_{x,i}}\n$$\nWe apply the chain rule to compute this derivative:\n$$\nf^{hg}_{x,i} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_{x,i}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\beta q^2 \\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\cdot (2q) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial u_{x,i}} = -\\beta q \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial u_{x,i}}\n$$\nThe hourglass measure $q$ is defined as a linear function of the nodal displacements $u_{x,j}$:\n$$\nq = \\sum_{j=1}^{8} u_{x,j}\\,\\xi_j\\,\\eta_j\n$$\nNow, we compute the partial derivative of $q$ with respect to $u_{x,i}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial u_{x,i}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_{x,i}} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{8} u_{x,j}\\,\\xi_j\\,\\eta_j \\right)\n$$\nSince the nodal displacements $u_{x,j}$ are independent variables, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial u_{x,j}}{\\partial u_{x,i}}$ is equal to the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial u_{x,i}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{8} \\frac{\\partial u_{x,j}}{\\partial u_{x,i}}\\,\\xi_j\\,\\eta_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{8} \\delta_{ij}\\,\\xi_j\\,\\eta_j = \\xi_i\\,\\eta_i\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the hourglass force, we obtain the general form of the hourglass nodal force:\n$$\nf^{hg}_{x,i} = -\\beta q \\xi_i \\eta_i\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Evaluation for the Given Displacement Field\n\nThe problem prescribes a pure hourglass displacement field:\n$$\nu_{x,i} = U_0\\,\\xi_i\\,\\eta_i, \\qquad u_{y,i}=0, \\qquad u_{z,i}=0\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the scalar hourglass measure, $q$, for this specific displacement field.\n$$\nq = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} u_{x,i}\\,\\xi_i\\,\\eta_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} (U_0\\,\\xi_i\\,\\eta_i)\\,\\xi_i\\,\\eta_i = U_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{8} (\\xi_i\\,\\eta_i)^2 = U_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\xi_i^2\\,\\eta_i^2\n$$\nFor each node $i$ of the hexahedral element, the local coordinates $\\xi_i$ and $\\eta_i$ are either $-1$ or $1$. Therefore, their squares are always unity:\n$$\n\\xi_i^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\eta_i^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1\n$$\nThus, $\\xi_i^2\\,\\eta_i^2 = 1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 8$. The summation becomes:\n$$\nq = U_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{8} 1 = 8 U_0\n$$\nNow we can write the explicit form of the hourglass nodal forces, $f^{hg}_{x,i}$, by substituting the expressions for $q=8 U_0$ and $\\beta=\\alpha E h$ into the formula derived in Part 1.\n$$\nf^{hg}_{x,i} = -\\beta q \\xi_i \\eta_i = -(\\alpha E h)(8 U_0)\\xi_i \\eta_i\n$$\n$$\nf^{hg}_{x,i} = -8\\alpha E h U_0 \\xi_i \\eta_i\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Computation of Total Stabilization Energy\n\nThe total stabilization energy $W_{hg}$ is computed using its definition and the values derived above.\n$$\nW_{hg} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta q^2\n$$\nSubstituting $\\beta = \\alpha E h$ and $q = 8 U_0$:\n$$\nW_{hg} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha E h)(8 U_0)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E h(64 U_0^2)\n$$\n$$\nW_{hg} = 32\\alpha E h U_0^2\n$$\nTo verify that this energy is non-negative, we examine the signs of each term in the expression:\n- The control parameter $\\alpha$ is given as positive: $\\alpha  0$.\n- The Young's modulus $E$ is a physical material property and is positive for any real material: $E  0$.\n- The element edge length $h$ is a geometric dimension and must be positive: $h  0$.\n- The squared amplitude $U_0^2$ is non-negative for any real value of $U_0$: $U_0^2 \\ge 0$.\n\nThe product of these terms, $W_{hg} = 32\\alpha E h U_0^2$, must therefore be non-negative ($W_{hg} \\ge 0$).

The definitions and parameter values are standard and physically realistic within the context of computational geomechanics. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in four parts, corresponding to the four tasks in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Scalar Hourglass Patterns and Strain-Free Condition**\n\nAn hourglass mode is a nodal displacement pattern that results in zero strain at the single Gauss point located at the element center $(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta)=(0,0,0)$. The displacement field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is interpolated from nodal displacements $\\boldsymbol{u}_a$ via the shape functions $N_a$: $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} N_a(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) \\boldsymbol{u}_a$.\nFirst, consider a scalar field $u(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} N_a(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) u_a$. Its gradient with respect to the parent coordinates $(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta)$ is $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} u = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} u_a \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} N_a$. At the element center, the gradient of the shape function for node $a$ is given by the problem statement as $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} N_a \\rvert_{(0,0,0)} = \\frac{1}{8}(\\xi_a, \\eta_a, \\zeta_a)^{\\top}$.\nTherefore, the gradient of the scalar field at the center is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} u \\bigg|_{(0,0,0)} = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} u_a \\left(\\frac{1}{8}(\\xi_a, \\eta_a, \\zeta_a)^{\\top}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sum_{a=1}^{8} u_a \\xi_a \\\\ \\sum_{a=1}^{8} u_a \\eta_a \\\\ \\sum_{a=1}^{8} u_a \\zeta_a \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor this gradient to be the zero vector, the nodal displacement pattern $\\{u_a\\}_{a=1}^8$ must be orthogonal to the three nodal vectors defined by the parent coordinates, $\\{\\xi_a\\}$, $\\{\\eta_a\\}$, and $\\{\\zeta_a\\}$. The problem seeks four such patterns, denoted $h^{\\alpha}_a \\in \\{-1,+1\\}$ for $\\alpha=1,2,3,4$, satisfying:\n$$\n\\sum_{a=1}^{8} h^{\\alpha}_a\\,\\xi_a = 0, \\quad \\sum_{a=1}^{8} h^{\\alpha}_a\\,\\eta_a = 0, \\quad \\sum_{a=1}^{8} h^{\\alpha}_a\\,\\zeta_a = 0\n$$\nThese conditions define the hourglass patterns. The space of nodal vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^8$ that are orthogonal to the three vectors $\\{\\xi_a\\}$, $\\{\\eta_a\\}$, and $\\{\\zeta_a\\}$ is of dimension $8-3=5$. A basis for this space also includes the constant vector $\\{1,1, ..., 1\\}$, which corresponds to rigid body translation and yields a zero gradient. The remaining four basis vectors constitute the hourglass modes. A standard, mutually orthogonal set of such patterns with entries in $\\{-1,+1\\}$ is constructed from products of the coordinate signs:\n$$\nh^{1}_a = \\xi_a \\eta_a \\\\\nh^{2}_a = \\eta_a \\zeta_a \\\\\nh^{3}_a = \\zeta_a \\xi_a \\\\\nh^{4}_a = \\xi_a \\eta_a \\zeta_a\n$$\nTo verify, take $h^{1}_a = \\xi_a \\eta_a$ as an example. The orthogonality conditions are checked:\n$\\sum_{a=1}^{8} (\\xi_a \\eta_a) \\xi_a = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} \\xi_a^2 \\eta_a = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} \\eta_a = 0$, since there are four nodes with $\\eta_a=+1$ and four nodes with $\\eta_a=-1$. Similarly, $\\sum_{a=1}^{8} (\\xi_a \\eta_a) \\eta_a = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} \\xi_a \\eta_a^2 = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} \\xi_a = 0$. Finally, $\\sum_{a=1}^{8} (\\xi_a \\eta_a) \\zeta_a=0$, because for each pair of $(\\xi_a, \\eta_a)$ values, there is one node with $\\zeta_a=+1$ and one with $\\zeta_a=-1$, causing the terms to cancel in pairs. Similar arguments hold for $h^2_a$, $h^3_a$, and $h^4_a$. This completes the derivation of the four scalar patterns.\n\nNext, we explain why these patterns produce a zero symmetric gradient, $\\nabla^s \\boldsymbol{u}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, in the physical space.\nLet the displacement field be a vector field $\\boldsymbol{u}$. The gradient of $\\boldsymbol{u}$ with respect to parent coordinates, $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\boldsymbol{u}$, is related to the gradient with respect to physical coordinates, $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}$, by the chain rule: $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\boldsymbol{u} = (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}) \\boldsymbol{J}$.\nThis implies $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} = (\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\boldsymbol{u}) \\boldsymbol{J}^{-1}$, provided the Jacobian $\\boldsymbol{J}$ is invertible.\nAn hourglass displacement mode is formed by setting the nodal displacements of one Cartesian component, say $u_x$, to a scalar hourglass pattern, e.g., $u_{a,x} = c\\,h^{\\alpha}_a$, and other components to zero.\nAt the center, the gradient of this component with respect to parent coordinates vanishes, as shown above: $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} u_x \\rvert_0 = \\boldsymbol{0}^{\\top}$. If all three components of displacement follow some scalar hourglass pattern (not necessarily the same one), then each row of the matrix $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\boldsymbol{u}$ will be a zero vector at the center. Thus, $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\boldsymbol{u}\\rvert_0 = \\boldsymbol{0}_{3\\times3}$.\nConsequently, the gradient in physical coordinates at the center is also the zero matrix:\n$$\n\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} \\bigg|_{(0,0,0)} = (\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\boldsymbol{u} \\rvert_{(0,0,0)}) \\boldsymbol{J}^{-1} = \\boldsymbol{0}_{3\\times3} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}^{-1} = \\boldsymbol{0}_{3\\times3}\n$$\nThe symmetric gradient operator is $\\nabla^s \\boldsymbol{u} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} + (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{\\top})$. If $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}\\rvert_0 = \\boldsymbol{0}$, it immediately follows that $\\nabla^s \\boldsymbol{u}\\rvert_0 = \\boldsymbol{0}$. This result is independent of the specific distortion matrix $\\boldsymbol{J}$, as long as it is non-singular.\n\n**Part 2: Enumeration of Vector Hourglass Modes**\n\nThe element has $8$ nodes with $3$ displacement degrees of freedom (DOFs) each, totaling $24$ DOFs. The state at the single integration point is described by the $3 \\times 3 = 9$ components of the displacement gradient tensor $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}$. The number of deformation modes that are not \"seen\" by the integration point is $24 - 9 = 15$. These are the zero-energy modes under reduced integration. These $15$ modes comprise $3$ rigid-body translations and $12$ internal kinematic modes, which are the hourglass modes.\n\nThe $12$ vector-valued hourglass modes can be systematically enumerated from the $4$ scalar patterns derived in Part 1. Each scalar pattern can be applied to any of the three Cartesian displacement components ($x$, $y$, or $z$), with the other two components being zero for all nodes.\nLet $\\boldsymbol{e}_x, \\boldsymbol{e}_y, \\boldsymbol{e}_z$ be the standard Cartesian basis vectors. The $12$ vector hourglass modes, described by their nodal displacement vectors $\\boldsymbol{u}_a$, are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item 4 modes for the $x$-component: $\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_a = h^{\\alpha}_a \\boldsymbol{e}_x\\}_{a=1}^8$ for $\\alpha \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n    \\item 4 modes for the $y$-component: $\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_a = h^{\\alpha}_a \\boldsymbol{e}_y\\}_{a=1}^8$ for $\\alpha \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n    \\item 4 modes for the $z$-component: $\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_a = h^{\\alpha}_a \\boldsymbol{e}_z\\}_{a=1}^8$ for $\\alpha \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThis constitutes a basis of $4 \\times 3 = 12$ linearly independent vectors for the hourglass mode subspace.\n\n**Part 3: Displacement Field for a Specific Hourglass Mode**\n\nWe are asked to construct the displacement field for the mode corresponding to the Cartesian $x$-component with the scalar pattern $h^{4}_a = \\xi_a \\eta_a \\zeta_a$. The nodal displacements are given by $\\boldsymbol{u}_a = (\\alpha h^4_a, 0, 0) = (\\alpha \\xi_a \\eta_a \\zeta_a, 0, 0)$, where $\\alpha$ is a scalar amplitude.\nThe displacement field $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta)$ is found by interpolation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} N_a(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) \\boldsymbol{u}_a\n$$\nThe $y$- and $z$-components are zero. The $x$-component is:\n$$\nu_x(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) = \\sum_{a=1}^{8} N_a(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) (\\alpha \\xi_a \\eta_a \\zeta_a) = \\alpha \\sum_{a=1}^{8} \\frac{1}{8}(1+\\xi_a \\xi)(1+\\eta_a \\eta)(1+\\zeta_a \\zeta) (\\xi_a \\eta_a \\zeta_a)\n$$\nExpanding the product and using $\\xi_a^2=\\eta_a^2=\\zeta_a^2=1$:\n$$\nu_x(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) = \\frac{\\alpha}{8} \\sum_{a=1}^{8} (\\xi_a\\eta_a\\zeta_a + \\eta_a\\zeta_a \\xi + \\xi_a\\zeta_a \\eta + \\xi_a\\eta_a \\zeta + \\zeta_a \\xi\\eta + \\xi_a \\eta\\zeta + \\eta_a \\xi\\zeta + \\xi\\eta\\zeta)\n$$\nUpon summing over all $8$ nodes ($a=1, \\dots, 8$), all terms involving products of one or two distinct coordinate signs sum to zero (e.g., $\\sum_a \\xi_a = 0$, $\\sum_a \\xi_a\\eta_a = 0$). Even the term $\\sum_a \\xi_a\\eta_a\\zeta_a$ is zero. The only term whose sum is non-zero is the final term, $\\xi\\eta\\zeta$, which is constant with respect to the summation index $a$:\n$$\n\\sum_{a=1}^{8} \\xi\\eta\\zeta = 8\\xi\\eta\\zeta\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $u_x$:\n$$\nu_x(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) = \\frac{\\alpha}{8} (8 \\xi\\eta\\zeta) = \\alpha \\xi\\eta\\zeta\n$$\nThus, the displacement field that excites this single hourglass mode is $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) = (\\alpha \\xi\\eta\\zeta, 0, 0)$.\nThe corresponding nodal displacements are $\\boldsymbol{u}_a = (\\alpha \\xi_a\\eta_a\\zeta_a, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Part 4: Calculation of Amplitude $\\alpha$**\n\nWe must find the amplitude $\\alpha$ such that the hourglass energy $E_h$ equals a target value $E_h^{\\star} = 1.5\\,\\text{kJ} = 1500\\,\\text{J}$.\nThe hourglass energy is given by $E_{h} = \\beta G \\frac{V}{\\ell^{2}} q^{2}$.\nThe parameters are $\\beta = 0.25$ and $G = 25 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{Pa}$.\nWe need to calculate the element volume $V$, the characteristic length squared $\\ell^2$, and the hourglass measure $q$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is $\\boldsymbol{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2  0.3  0 \\\\ 0.1  0.9  0.2 \\\\ 0  0.25  1.1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe element volume $V$ is approximated by $V \\approx 8\\,\\det(\\boldsymbol{J})$.\n$$\n\\det(\\boldsymbol{J}) = 1.2(0.9 \\cdot 1.1 - 0.2 \\cdot 0.25) - 0.3(0.1 \\cdot 1.1 - 0.2 \\cdot 0) = 1.2(0.99 - 0.05) - 0.3(0.11) = 1.2(0.94) - 0.033 = 1.128 - 0.033 = 1.095\n$$\nSo, $V = 8 \\times 1.095 = 8.76\\,\\text{m}^3$.\n\nThe characteristic length squared $\\ell^2$ is $\\ell^{2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{J}^{T}\\boldsymbol{J})$. The trace of $\\boldsymbol{J}^{T}\\boldsymbol{J}$ is the sum of the squared norms of the columns of $\\boldsymbol{J}$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{J}^{T}\\boldsymbol{J}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (J_{ij})^2 \\\\\n= (1.2^2 + 0.1^2 + 0^2) + (0.3^2 + 0.9^2 + 0.25^2) + (0^2 + 0.2^2 + 1.1^2) \\\\\n= (1.44 + 0.01) + (0.09 + 0.81 + 0.0625) + (0.04 + 1.21) \\\\\n= 1.45 + 0.9625 + 1.25 = 3.6625 \\,\\text{m}^2\n\\end{align*}\nSo, $\\ell^2 = \\frac{3.6625}{3} \\,\\text{m}^2 \\approx 1.22083\\,\\text{m}^2$.\n\nThe hourglass measure $q$ is $q = \\frac{1}{8}\\sum_{a=1}^{8} h^{4}_a u_{a,x}$. For the chosen mode, $u_{a,x} = \\alpha h^4_a$.\n$$\nq = \\frac{1}{8}\\sum_{a=1}^{8} h^{4}_a (\\alpha h^4_a) = \\frac{\\alpha}{8}\\sum_{a=1}^{8} (h^{4}_a)^2\n$$\nSince $h^4_a \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$, $(h^4_a)^2 = 1$. Thus, $\\sum_{a=1}^{8} (h^4_a)^2 = 8$.\nThis simplifies to $q = \\frac{\\alpha}{8} \\cdot 8 = \\alpha$.\n\nNow we set the energy equation to the target value and solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$\nE_h^{\\star} = \\beta G \\frac{V}{\\ell^{2}} \\alpha^{2}\n$$\n$$\n1500 = 0.25 \\times (25 \\times 10^6) \\times \\frac{8.76}{3.6625/3} \\times \\alpha^{2}\n$$\n$$\n1500 = (6.25 \\times 10^6) \\times \\frac{8.76 \\times 3}{3.6625} \\times \\alpha^{2}\n$$\n$$\n1500 \\approx (6.25 \\times 10^6) \\times (7.17547) \\times \\alpha^{2}\n$$\n$$\n1500 \\approx (4.484669 \\times 10^7) \\times \\alpha^{2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha^2$:\n$$\n\\alpha^2 = \\frac{1500}{4.484669 \\times 10^7} \\approx 3.344699 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m}^2\n$$\nTaking the square root to find the amplitude $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\sqrt{3.344699 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.00578333\\,\\text{m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the required amplitude is $\\alpha = 0.005783\\,\\text{m}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.005783}\n$$", "id": "3555190"}]}
