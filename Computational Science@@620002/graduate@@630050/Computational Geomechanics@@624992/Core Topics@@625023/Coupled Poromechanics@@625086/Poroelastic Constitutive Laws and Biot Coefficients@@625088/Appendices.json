The problem is self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental definitions of porosity and volume fractions. The total volume $V$ of a porous medium is the sum of the pore volume $V_p$ and the solid volume $V_s$:\n$$V = V_p + V_s$$\nThe porosity $n$ is defined as the ratio of the pore volume to the total volume:\n$$n = \\frac{V_p}{V}$$\nThe problem considers a deformation from an initial, undeformed reference state (denoted by subscript $0$) to a current state. The initial porosity is $n_0 = \\frac{V_{p0}}{V_0} = 0.25$.\n\nWe seek to find the change in porosity, $\\Delta n = n - n_0$. The current porosity is $n = \\frac{V_p}{V}$. We must express the current volumes $V_p$ and $V$ in terms of the initial volumes and the applied strain.\n\nThe volumetric strain of the solid skeleton, $\\varepsilon_v$, relates the change in total volume, $\\Delta V = V - V_0$, to the initial total volume $V_0$. For small strains, this relationship is:\n$$\\varepsilon_v = \\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0} = \\frac{V - V_0}{V_0}$$\nFrom this, the current total volume $V$ can be expressed as:\n$$V = V_0 (1 + \\varepsilon_v)$$\nThe problem states that the individual solid grains are incompressible. This is a critical assumption which implies that the volume of the solid phase remains constant throughout the deformation process:\n$$\\Delta V_s = V_s - V_{s0} = 0 \\implies V_s = V_{s0}$$\nThe change in total volume $\\Delta V$ can be decomposed into the change in pore volume $\\Delta V_p$ and the change in solid volume $\\Delta V_s$:\n$$\\Delta V = \\Delta V_p + \\Delta V_s$$\nApplying the grain incompressibility condition ($\\Delta V_s = 0$), we find that the change in pore volume is equal to the change in total volume:\n$$\\Delta V_p = \\Delta V = V_0 \\varepsilon_v$$\nNow we can express the current pore volume $V_p$ in terms of initial quantities:\n$$V_p = V_{p0} + \\Delta V_p$$\nUsing the definition of initial porosity, $V_{p0} = n_0 V_0$, we have:\n$$V_p = n_0 V_0 + V_0 \\varepsilon_v = V_0 (n_0 + \\varepsilon_v)$$\nWe now have expressions for the current total volume $V$ and the current pore volume $V_p$. We can compute the current porosity $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{V_p}{V} = \\frac{V_0(n_0 + \\varepsilon_v)}{V_0(1 + \\varepsilon_v)} = \\frac{n_0 + \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v}$$\nThe change in porosity $\\Delta n$ is therefore:\n$$\\Delta n = n - n_0 = \\frac{n_0 + \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v} - n_0$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta n = \\frac{(n_0 + \\varepsilon_v) - n_0(1 + \\varepsilon_v)}{1 + \\varepsilon_v} = \\frac{n_0 + \\varepsilon_v - n_0 - n_0 \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v}$$\n$$\\Delta n = \\frac{\\varepsilon_v - n_0 \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v} = \\frac{(1 - n_0) \\varepsilon_v}{1 + \\varepsilon_v}$$\nThis is the exact expression for the change in porosity under the given assumptions. The problem, however, asks for the *first-order* change in porosity. Since the analysis is in the small-strain regime ($|\\varepsilon_v| \\ll 1$), we can linearize this expression with respect to $\\varepsilon_v$. We use the first-order Taylor series expansion for the term $\\frac{1}{1 + \\varepsilon_v}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{1 + \\varepsilon_v} \\approx 1 - \\varepsilon_v \\quad \\text{for } |\\varepsilon_v| \\ll 1$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta n$:\n$$\\Delta n \\approx (1 - n_0) \\varepsilon_v (1 - \\varepsilon_v) = (1 - n_0) (\\varepsilon_v - \\varepsilon_v^2)$$\nRetaining only the terms that are first-order in $\\varepsilon_v$, we obtain the final expression for the first-order change in porosity:\n$$\\Delta n \\approx (1 - n_0) \\varepsilon_v$$\nThis result is derived purely from kinematic considerations as required. The physical conditions of constant pore pressure and the value of the fluid bulk modulus $K_f$ serve to define a drained loading path, but the numerical values are not required for this specific calculation.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the first-order expression:\n- Initial porosity: $n_0 = 0.25$\n- Volumetric strain: $\\varepsilon_v = -0.01$\n\n$$\\Delta n = (1 - 0.25) \\times (-0.01)$$\n$$\\Delta n = 0.75 \\times (-0.01)$$\n$$\\Delta n = -0.0075$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the porosity decreases, which is consistent with the applied compaction ($\\varepsilon_v < 0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.0075}$$", "id": "3551703"}, {"introduction": "Poroelastic parameters are not abstract constants; they are material properties determined through laboratory experiments.

I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Governing Relationships**\n\nThe theory of linear, isotropic poroelasticity is founded on a set of constitutive relations. For an isotropic change in mean total stress $d\\sigma$ and pore pressure $dp$, the change in volumetric strain $d\\epsilon_v$ and the change in fluid content $d\\zeta$ (volume of fluid introduced per unit reference volume) are given by:\n$$d\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} d\\sigma' = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma - \\alpha dp) \\quad (1)$$\n$$d\\zeta = \\alpha d\\epsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} dp \\quad (2)$$\nwhere $d\\sigma' = d\\sigma - \\alpha dp$ is the change in effective stress. The parameters are defined from the material's constituents:\nThe Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ is defined as:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} \\quad (3)$$\nThe Biot modulus $M$ is defined by the storage relation:\n$$\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha - \\phi}{K_s} \\quad (4)$$\n\nFor an undrained test, there is no fluid mass exchange with the exterior, so $d\\zeta = 0$. From equation ($2$), this gives:\n$$\\alpha d\\epsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M} dp = 0 \\implies dp = -\\alpha M d\\epsilon_v$$\nSubstituting this into equation ($1$):\n$$d\\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma - \\alpha(-\\alpha M d\\epsilon_v)) = \\frac{1}{K_d} (d\\sigma + \\alpha^2 M d\\epsilon_v)$$\nRearranging for $d\\epsilon_v$:\n$$d\\epsilon_v \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2 M}{K_d}\\right) = \\frac{d\\sigma}{K_d} \\implies d\\epsilon_v = \\frac{d\\sigma}{K_d - \\alpha^2 M}$$\nThis relationship is usually expressed in terms of the undrained bulk modulus, $K_u = d\\sigma/d\\epsilon_v$ (for an undrained test). However, from the derivation, a negative sign appears depending on convention. Standard literature gives the relationship as:\n$$K_u = K_d + \\alpha^2 M \\quad (5)$$\nSkempton's coefficient $B$ is the ratio of induced pore pressure change to the change in total stress under undrained conditions, $B = (dp/d\\sigma)_{\\text{undrained}}$.\n$$\\frac{dp}{d\\sigma} = \\frac{dp}{d\\epsilon_v} \\frac{d\\epsilon_v}{d\\sigma} = (\\alpha M) \\frac{1}{K_u}$$\nSo, we have:\n$$B = \\frac{\\alpha M}{K_u} \\quad (6)$$\nCombining ($5$) and ($6$): $B = \\frac{\\alpha M}{K_d + \\alpha^2 M}$.\n\n**Calibration 1: Low-Strain Ultrasonic Regime**\n\nUsing the data for the low-strain regime: $K_d = 10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $K_s = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\phi = 0.20$, and $K_f = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the Biot coefficient $\\alpha_{low}$:\n$$\\alpha_{low} = 1 - \\frac{K_d}{K_s} = 1 - \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = 1 - 0.277\\overline{7} = 0.722\\overline{2}$$\nNext, calculate the Biot modulus $M_{low}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{M_{low}} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha_{low} - \\phi}{K_s} = \\frac{0.20}{2.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{0.722\\overline{2} - 0.20}{36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{M_{low}} = 0.0909\\overline{09}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} + \\frac{0.522\\overline{2}}{36}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = 0.0909\\overline{09}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} + 0.014506\\overline{1}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = 0.105415\\overline{15}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$$\n$$M_{low} = \\frac{1}{0.105415\\overline{15}}\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\approx 9.486\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nSo, the low-strain calibration yields: $\\alpha_{low} \\approx 0.722$ and $M_{low} \\approx 9.49\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\n**Inference from High-Strain Undrained Triaxial Data**\n\nUsing the data from the high-strain regime: $K_u = 13\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $B = 0.60$, $\\phi = 0.20$, $K_s = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, and $K_f = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$. We want to infer the implied skeleton modulus $K_{d,high}$ and the corresponding $\\alpha_{high}$ and $M_{high}$.\n\nFrom equation ($6$), we find the product $\\alpha M$:\n$$\\alpha_{high} M_{high} = B \\cdot K_u = 0.60 \\times 13\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nNow we have a system of three equations for $\\alpha_{high}$, $M_{high}$, and $K_{d,high}$:\n1. $\\alpha_{high} M_{high} = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n2. $\\alpha_{high} = 1 - K_{d,high}/36$\n3. $1/M_{high} = 0.20/2.5 + (\\alpha_{high} - 0.20)/36$\n\nFrom (1), $M_{high} = 7.8 / \\alpha_{high}$. Substitute this into (3):\n$$\\frac{\\alpha_{high}}{7.8} = \\frac{0.20}{2.5} + \\frac{\\alpha_{high} - 0.20}{36}$$\n$$\\frac{\\alpha_{high}}{7.8} = 0.08 + \\frac{\\alpha_{high}}{36} - \\frac{0.20}{36}$$\nRearrange to solve for $\\alpha_{high}$:\n$$\\alpha_{high} \\left(\\frac{1}{7.8} - \\frac{1}{36}\\right) = 0.08 - \\frac{0.20}{36}$$\n$$\\alpha_{high} (0.128205... - 0.027777...) = 0.08 - 0.005555...$$\n$$\\alpha_{high} (0.100427...) = 0.074444...$$\n$$\\alpha_{high} = \\frac{0.074444...}{0.100427...} \\approx 0.7413$$\nNow, find $K_{d,high}$ from equation (2):\n$$K_{d,high} = K_s (1 - \\alpha_{high}) = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\times (1 - 0.7413) = 36\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\times 0.2587 \\approx 9.31\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nFinally, find $M_{high}$ from equation (1):\n$$M_{high} = \\frac{7.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{\\alpha_{high}} = \\frac{7.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{0.7413} \\approx 10.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nThe high-strain analysis implies: $K_{d,high} \\approx 9.31\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\alpha_{high} \\approx 0.741$, and $M_{high} \\approx 10.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\n**Contrast and Analysis**\n\nLet's summarize the parameters from the two regimes:\n- **Low-Strain:** $K_{d,low} = 10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\alpha_{low} \\approx 0.722$, $M_{low} \\approx 9.49\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ (with $K_f = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$)\n- **High-Strain:** $K_{d,high} \\approx 9.31\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\alpha_{high} \\approx 0.741$, $M_{high} \\approx 10.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ (with $K_f = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$)\n\nComparison reveals:\n1.  **Drained Bulk Modulus:** $K_{d,high} < K_{d,low}$. The drained skeleton *softens* (its bulk modulus decreases) at higher volumetric compressive strain. This is physically plausible due to microcrack growth or grain rearrangement.\n2.  **Biot Coefficient:** $\\alpha_{high} > \\alpha_{low}$. Since $\\alpha = 1 - K_d/K_s$, the decrease in $K_d$ causes an increase in $\\alpha$.\n3.  **Biot Modulus:** $M_{high} > M_{low}$. This is due to two competing effects in the formula $1/M = \\phi/K_f + (\\alpha-\\phi)/K_s$. The fluid stiffens ($K_f$ increases from $2.2$ to $2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$), which decreases the term $\\phi/K_f$ and thus tends to increase $M$. The Biot coefficient also increases, which increases the term $(\\alpha-\\phi)/K_s$ and tends to decrease $M$. The dominant effect here is the stiffening of the fluid.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options by comparing the measured undrained data ($K_u = 13\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $B = 0.60$) with a prediction based on the low-strain rock properties ($K_{d,low}=10\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\alpha_{low}=0.722$) but using the fluid properties of the high-strain test ($K_f=2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$).\nFirst, calculate the predicted Biot modulus $M_{pred}$ under these conditions:\n$$\\frac{1}{M_{pred}} = \\frac{\\phi}{K_f} + \\frac{\\alpha_{low} - \\phi}{K_s} = \\frac{0.20}{2.5} + \\frac{0.7222 - 0.20}{36} = 0.08 + 0.0145 = 0.0945\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$$\n$$M_{pred} \\approx 10.58\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nNow, predict the undrained properties $K_{u,pred}$ and $B_{pred}$:\n$$K_{u,pred} = K_{d,low} + \\alpha_{low}^2 M_{pred} = 10\\,\\mathrm{GPa} + (0.7222)^2 (10.58\\,\\mathrm{GPa}) = 10 + 5.52 = 15.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\n$$B_{pred} = \\frac{\\alpha_{low} M_{pred}}{K_{u,pred}} = \\frac{0.7222 \\times 10.58}{15.52} \\approx 0.492$$\n\nComparing the measurement with this linear prediction:\n- **Undrained Modulus:** $K_{u,meas} (13\\,\\mathrm{GPa})$ is lower than $K_{u,pred} (\\approx 15.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa})$.\n- **Skempton's B:** $B_{meas} (0.60)$ is higher than $B_{pred} (\\approx 0.49)$.\nThe discrepancy is that the high-strain measurement shows a softer undrained response and greater pore pressure generation than predicted by the low-strain model.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **The drained skeleton bulk modulus $K_d(\\epsilon_v)$ softens (decreases) at high volumetric strain, increasing $\\alpha$, while the fluid stiffens with pressure so $M(p)$ increases slightly; the combined effect reduces $K_u$ and increases $B$ in the undrained triaxial data compared to the low-strain ultrasonic-based prediction.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with my analysis.\n- $K_d$ softens ($10 \\to 9.31\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$). **Correct**.\n- $\\alpha$ increases ($0.722 \\to 0.741$). **Correct**.\n- Fluid stiffens ($K_f: 2.2 \\to 2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$) and $M$ increases ($9.49 \\to 10.52\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$). **Correct**.\n- The result is that the measured $K_u$ is lower than the prediction, and the measured $B$ is higher.

It is a valid computational geomechanics problem. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n\nThe problem requires the calibration of four poroelastic parameters—$K$, $G$, $\\alpha$, and $M$—by fitting a model to experimental data within a constrained optimization framework. The calibration is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem where the independent variables are the drained bulk modulus $K$ and the shear modulus $G$. The Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ and Biot modulus $M$ are treated as dependent parameters, functionally related to $K$ and known material constants.\n\nThe objective is to find the pair $(K, G)$ that minimizes the sum of squared, scaled residuals, $F(K, G) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} r_i^2$. The residuals quantify the mismatch between the model's predictions and the measured data. For a given pair of optimization variables $(K, G)$, the model predictions are computed as follows:\n\nFirst, the Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ is determined from its definition in terms of the frame and solid grain bulk moduli:\n$$\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K}{K_s}\n$$\nwhere $K_s$ is the given bulk modulus of the solid grains.\n\nSecond, the Biot modulus $M$, which characterizes the pressure required to force fluid into the pore space at constant bulk volume, is calculated from the implicit relation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{\\alpha - \\phi}{K_s} + \\frac{\\phi}{K_f}\n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the porosity and $K_f$ is the bulk modulus of the pore fluid. This can be directly inverted to find $M$. A physical requirement for stability (specifically, for Skempton's coefficient $B$ to be in the range $[0, 1]$) is that the term on the right-hand side must be positive. This implies a constraint on $K$ via $\\alpha$, which is naturally satisfied for the given datasets.\n\nThird, using the computed $K$, $\\alpha$, and $M$, the predicted undrained bulk modulus $K_u$ is given by the well-known Gassmann's equation:\n$$\nK_u = K + \\alpha^2 M\n$$\nThe shear modulus is assumed to be unaffected by the pore fluid, so the undrained shear modulus $G_u$ is equal to the drained shear modulus $G$.\n\nFourth, the predicted undrained Poisson's ratio $\\nu_u$ is calculated using the standard isotropic elasticity relationship, applied to the undrained moduli:\n$$\n\\nu_u = \\frac{3 K_u - 2 G}{2 (3 K_u + G)}\n$$\n\nWith these model predictions, the four dimensionless residuals are constructed by comparing the model values to the measured data $(K^{\\mathrm{d}}_{\\mathrm{meas}}, G^{\\mathrm{d}}_{\\mathrm{meas}}, K^{\\mathrm{u}}_{\\mathrm{meas}}, \\nu^{\\mathrm{u}}_{\\mathrm{meas}})$ and normalizing by the specified scales $(s_K, s_G, s_{K_u}, s_{\\nu})$:\n$$\nr_1 = \\frac{K - K^{\\mathrm{d}}_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{s_K}, \\quad\nr_2 = \\frac{G - G^{\\mathrm{d}}_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{s_G}, \\quad\nr_3 = \\frac{K_u - K^{\\mathrm{u}}_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{s_{K_u}}, \\quad\nr_4 = \\frac{\\nu_u - \\nu^{\\mathrm{u}}_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{s_{\\nu}}\n$$\n\nThe optimization problem is thus stated as:\n$$\n\\min_{K, G} \\left( r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2 + r_4^2 \\right)\n$$\nsubject to the physical constraints $0 < K < K_s$ and $G > 0$.\n\nThis constrained nonlinear least-squares minimization problem is solved numerically using the `scipy.optimize.least_squares` function from the SciPy library. This function is designed to minimize the sum of squares of a vector-valued function (the residuals vector $\\mathbf{r} = [r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4]$). The 'trust-region reflective' algorithm is employed as it is robust and can handle the box constraints on $K$ and $G$ efficiently. For each dataset, a sensible initial guess for the optimization is provided by the measured drained values, i.e., $(K_0, G_0) = (K^{\\mathrm{d}}_{\\mathrm{meas}}, G^{\\mathrm{d}}_{\\mathrm{meas}})$.\n\nUpon finding the optimal pair $(K_{\\mathrm{opt}}, G_{\\mathrm{opt}})$, the final calibrated values for $\\alpha$ and $M$ are computed using their respective definitions with $K = K_{\\mathrm{opt}}$. The resulting set of four parameters $[K_{\\mathrm{opt}}, G_{\\mathrm{opt}}, \\alpha_{\\mathrm{opt}}, M_{\\mathrm{opt}}]$ is then rounded to six decimal places as required.
