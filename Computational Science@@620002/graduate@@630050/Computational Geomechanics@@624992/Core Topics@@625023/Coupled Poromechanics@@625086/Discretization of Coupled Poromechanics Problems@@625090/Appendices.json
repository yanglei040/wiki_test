The analysis includes deriving the discrete formulation, investigating the stability of the chosen finite element pair via the inf-sup constant $\\beta_h$, and proposing diagnostics for numerical locking.\n\n### 1. Discrete Formulation and Patch Test Analysis\n\nThe weak form of the governing equations is found by multiplying by test functions $(\\boldsymbol{v}, q)$ and integrating over $\\Omega$. For $(\\boldsymbol{u}_h, p_h) \\in \\boldsymbol{V}_h \\times Q_h$ and test functions $(\\boldsymbol{v}_h, q_h)$, the Galerkin formulation is:\nFind $(\\boldsymbol{u}_h, p_h)$ satisfying the essential boundary conditions, such that for all test functions $(\\boldsymbol{v}_h, q_h)$ (with $\\boldsymbol{v}_h = \\boldsymbol{0}$ on the Dirichlet boundary):\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\boldsymbol{u}_h, p_h) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{v}_h) \\,d\\Omega = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} q_h \\left( \\alpha\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{u}_h + \\frac{1}{M}p_h \\right) \\,d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nIn the patch test, the prescribed displacement $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{E}\\,\\boldsymbol{x}$ is a linear field, which the $\\mathbb{P}_1$ displacement space can represent exactly. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{u}_h(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{E}\\,\\boldsymbol{x}$. The volumetric strain is therefore uniform: $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{u}_h = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{E}) = \\varepsilon_v$. The undrained mass balance equation, $\\alpha\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{u} + \\frac{1}{M}p = 0$, becomes an algebraic relation for the exact pressure $p_{\\text{exact}}$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\varepsilon_v + \\frac{1}{M}p_{\\text{exact}} = 0 \\implies p_{\\text{exact}} = -\\alpha M \\varepsilon_v\n$$\nSince $\\varepsilon_v$ is constant, $p_{\\text{exact}}$ is also constant, which the $\\mathbb{P}_1$ pressure space can represent exactly.\n\n### 2. Spurious Pressure Mode and Inf-Sup Constant\n\nA spurious pressure mode is a non-trivial pressure field $q_h \\in Q_h$ such that $\\int_{\\Omega} q_h (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_h) \\, d\\Omega = 0$ for all $\\boldsymbol{v}_h \\in \\boldsymbol{V}_h$. Since $\\boldsymbol{v}_h$ is linear on each of the two triangles ($T_1, T_2$), its divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_h$ is constant on each triangle. This condition implies that $\\int_{T_1} q_h \\, d\\Omega = 0$ and $\\int_{T_2} q_h \\, d\\Omega = 0$. For a linear function on a triangle, this means the sum of its nodal values on that triangle must be zero. Let the vertices of the square be $N_1(0,0)$, $N_2(h,0)$, $N_3(h,h)$, and $N_4(0,h)$. The triangles are $T_1=(N_1,N_2,N_3)$ and $T_2=(N_1,N_3,N_4)$. The conditions for a spurious mode are:\n$$\nq_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 0\n$$\n$$\nq_1 + q_3 + q_4 = 0\n$$\nA non-trivial solution is the checkerboard-like pattern with nodal values $(1, 0, -1, 0)$ for $(q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4)$. The existence of such a non-zero $q_h$ for which the numerator in the definition of $\\beta_h$ is zero for all $\\boldsymbol{v}_h$ implies that $\\beta_h=0$ for this specific patch.\n\n### 3. Asymptotic Rate of the Inf-Sup Constant\n\nWhile $\\beta_h = 0$ for this particular two-element patch, the question asks for the asymptotic rate as $h \\to 0$, which refers to the behavior on a sequence of regularly refined meshes. For the $\\mathbb{P}_1$-$\\mathbb{P}_1$ element pair on such meshes, the inf-sup constant is known to degrade linearly with the mesh size. This instability is caused by the presence of \"almost-spurious\" checkerboard modes that are not perfectly orthogonal to the space of discrete divergences but are only weakly controlled. The established theoretical result for this element family is:\n$$\n\\beta_h \\sim C h.\n$$\nTherefore, the exponent is $m=1$.\n\n### 4. Locking Diagnostics\n\nVolumetric locking manifests as an overly stiff response and spurious pressure oscillations. Two quantitative diagnostics are:\n\n**1. Pressure Oscillation Indicator**: This measures the oscillatory component of the computed pressure $p_h$. Let $\\Pi_0 p_h$ be the element-wise constant projection of $p_h$. The oscillatory part is $p_h' = p_h - \\Pi_0 p_h$. A normalized measure is:\n$$\nD_1 := \\frac{\\|p_h - \\Pi_0 p_h\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}}{\\|\\Pi_0 p_h\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}}\n$$\nA value of $D_1 \\gg 0$ indicates strong pressure oscillations relative to the mean pressure on elements, a symptom of locking.\n\n**2. Divergence-Pressure Inconsistency**: In the continuous model, $p = -\\alpha M \\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{u}$. Locking creates a mismatch between the computed pressure $p_h$ and the pressure implied by the kinematics, $p_{\\text{kin}} := -\\alpha M (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_h)$. A diagnostic can measure the $L^2$-norm of the difference between the element-averaged computed pressure, $\\Pi_0 p_h$, and $p_{\\text{kin}}$:\n$$\nD_2 := \\frac{\\|\\Pi_0 p_h + \\alpha M (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_h)\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}}{\\|\\Pi_0 p_h\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}}\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{u}_h$ is the piecewise constant divergence computed from the displacement solution. A large value indicates a severe violation of the constitutive mass balance at the element level.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3519137"}, {"introduction": "Once volumetric locking is identified as a potential issue, the next step is to explore methods to mitigate it.

The $\\bar{B}$ method removes volumetric locking and simultaneously enforces the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi inf-sup stability for equal-order interpolation; therefore, it guarantees oscillation-free pressures in the low-permeability, small-time-step regime.\n\nE. If only the elastic volumetric stiffness is reduced-integrated but the solid–fluid coupling term is kept fully integrated, then for the same manufactured field the element-wise mass source entering the $q\\equiv 1$ pressure equation is exact for both strategies over this time step.", "solution": "The problem analyzes the effect of two anti-locking strategies, the $\\bar{B}$ method and one-point reduced integration (RI), on the mass balance equation for a single bilinear element. The key is to calculate the \"solid-to-fluid mass source\" term, which is the integral of the coupling term $\\alpha (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1})$ tested against $q=1$.\n\nFirst, we find the exact value. The displacement is $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = [\\beta x^3/h^2, 0]^T$, so the volumetric strain is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\beta x^3/h^2) = 3\\beta x^2/h^2$.

The source term is $M_{source}^{\\text{RI}} = \\alpha (\\frac{3\\beta}{4}) \\times h^2 = \\frac{3}{4}\\alpha \\beta h^2$. This is $75\\%$ of the exact value, an underestimation of $25\\%$.\n\nWith these results, we can evaluate the options:\n*   **A**: This statement is correct. The $\\bar{B}$ method is exact, and RI underestimates the source term by $25\\%$.\n*   **B**: The mass balance equation tested with $q=1$ gives $S \\int (p^{n+1}-p^n) dV + M_{source}^{\\text{num}} = 0$. With $p^n=0$, the element-mean pressure $\\bar{p}^{n+1}$ satisfies $S h^2 \\bar{p}^{n+1} + M_{source}^{\\text{num}} = 0$, so $\\bar{p}^{n+1} = -M_{source}^{\\text{num}} / (S h^2)$. For the $\\bar{B}$ method, this gives $\\bar{p}^{n+1}_{\\bar{B}} = -(\\alpha \\beta h^2) / (S h^2) = -(\\alpha/S)\\beta$. For RI, it gives $\\bar{p}^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{RI}} = -(\\frac{3}{4}\\alpha \\beta h^2) / (S h^2) = -(\\alpha/S)(3\\beta/4)$. This statement is correct.\n*   **C**: This statement is too strong and therefore incorrect. Reduced integration is a standard, admissible, and convergent method used to mitigate locking, despite its known deficiencies. It does not \"necessarily\" violate global conservation for *any* field.\n*   **D**: This statement is incorrect. The $\\bar{B}$ method is a fix for volumetric locking; it does not enforce the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) condition for equal-order elements.

Both Pressure-Projection (PP) and Galerkin/Least-Squares (GLS) methods add terms to the weak formulation to control the resulting spurious pressure oscillations.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Pressure-Projection (PP) Stabilization**: The PP stabilization term is $S_{\\mathrm{PP}}(p_h, q_h) = \\sum_{K} \\gamma_K \\int_K (p_h - \\Pi_0^K p_h) (q_h - \\Pi_0^K q_h) \\, dx$. This term acts on the component of the pressure field that deviates from the element-wise constant mean, $(p_h - \\Pi_0^K p_h)$. Spurious pressure oscillations (e.g., checkerboard modes) are high-frequency and have a large component that is non-constant within each element. The PP term directly penalizes the $L^2$-norm of this oscillatory component, effectively filtering it from the solution. The stabilization is independent of $c_0$ and thus remains active in the incompressible limit. The scaling $\\gamma_K \\sim \\bar{k}_K/h_K^2$ is chosen to be dimensionally consistent with the physical diffusion term.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Galerkin/Least-Squares (GLS) Stabilization**: The GLS method adds a term proportional to the element-wise residual of the mass balance equation, $R_{m,h}$. The term is of the form $S_{\\mathrm{GLS}} = \\sum_K \\tau_K \\int_K R_{m,h} \\cdot L^*(q_h) \\, dx$, where $L^*$ is the formal adjoint of the mass balance operator. To control pressure oscillations, the most important component is the one involving the highest-order pressure derivatives. In the residual $R_{m,h}$, this is $-\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{k} \\nabla p_h^{n+1})$. The GLS term thus includes a contribution that looks like $\\sum_K \\tau_K \\int_K [-\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{k} \\nabla p_h^{n+1})] [-\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{k} \\nabla q_h)] \\, dx$. This term penalizes the element-wise residual of the pressure-diffusion part of the equation, effectively enhancing stability. The standard scaling for the stabilization parameter, $\\tau_K \\sim h_K^2/\\bar{k}_K$, makes this term consistent and ensures it acts as a form of numerical diffusion that is independent of $c_0$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**:\n*   **A**: This option correctly describes the mechanism of both PP and GLS stabilization. It identifies that PP filters high-frequency pressure modes and that GLS adds an effective pressure diffusion via the residual of the physical diffusion term, with both mechanisms being independent of $c_0$ and using the correct parameter scalings.\n*   **B**: This is incorrect. The PP method adds a separate term; it does not rescale the temporal term. Its importance grows as the temporal term vanishes ($c_0 \\to 0$).\n*   **C**: This is incorrect. While GLS involves all parts of the residual, the control on pressure oscillations specifically relies on the pressure-derivative terms. The claim that PP is negligible is also false.\n*   **D**: This is incorrect. The PP method penalizes the *fluctuation from the mean* ($p_h - \\Pi_0^K p_h$), not the mean pressure itself ($\\Pi_0^K p_h$).\n*   **E**: This is incorrect. It provides the wrong scaling for the GLS parameter $\\tau_K$ and makes other flawed assertions.\n\nTherefore, statement A provides the correct analysis of both stabilization schemes in the specified limit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3519156"}]}
