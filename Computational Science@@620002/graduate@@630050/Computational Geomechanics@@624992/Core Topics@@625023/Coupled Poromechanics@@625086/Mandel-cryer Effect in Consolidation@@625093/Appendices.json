The latter most commonly arise in mixed $u-p$ formulations from the failure to satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) inf-sup stability condition, especially in the nearly undrained (incompressible) limit that occurs at early times.\n\n**A. Compute the semi-analytical Mandel benchmark solution for the same geometry and material parameters, and compare $p(0,H/2,t)$ versus $t$ against the FEM results while performing systematic mesh refinement (element size $h\\to 0$) and time-step refinement ($\\Delta t\\to 0$). If the FEM overshoot magnitude and timing converge to the benchmark values in $\\tau$, accept the overshoot as physical.**\n\nThis is the most rigorous form of code verification. A benchmark solution, whether fully analytical or a highly accurate semi-analytical/numerical solution, represents the \"true\" solution to the mathematical model.\n1.  **Systematic Convergence**: Performing a convergence study where the discretization parameters ($h$ and $\\Delta t$) are systematically reduced is fundamental to V&V.\n2.  **Comparison to Benchmark**: If the numerical solution (including the overshoot feature) converges to the known benchmark solution, it provides definitive proof that the code correctly solves the governing equations and that the observed feature is physical, i.e., part of the exact solution of the model.\nThis procedure effectively tests the entire numerical implementation, including spatial and temporal discretization.\n\n**Verdict**: **Correct**. This is the gold standard for verification.\n\n**B. Decrease the time step $\\Delta t$ while keeping the mesh fixed, and if the overshoot magnitude shrinks toward zero, conclude that the overshoot is physical because the finer temporal resolution “removes numerical damping” and reveals the true response.**\n\nThis statement contains a critical logical flaw. In a convergent numerical scheme, as the discretization is refined (e.g., $\\Delta t \\to 0$), the numerical solution should approach the true physical solution.\n1.  If the true solution contains an overshoot of a certain magnitude, the numerical solution's overshoot should converge *to that magnitude*.\n2.  If a feature's magnitude *shrinks toward zero* upon refinement, it is by definition a numerical artifact whose existence is dependent on the coarseness of the discretization. It is a component of the discretization error.\nThe justification about \"removing numerical damping\" is misused. Reducing numerical damping should make the result *more* faithful to the true solution, not make a real feature disappear.\n\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The reasoning is precisely backward.\n\n**C. Replace an equal-order displacement–pressure interpolation with a mixed element that satisfies the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) stability condition (for example, quadratic displacement and linear pressure) or add a consistent stabilization; then repeat mesh and time-step refinement. If the overshoot persists with nearly unchanged magnitude and timing and becomes mesh-insensitive, accept it as physical.**\n\nThis step directly targets the primary known cause of spurious pressure oscillations in this type of problem.\n1.  **LBB Condition**: Equal-order interpolations (e.g., linear displacement and linear pressure) are known to be unstable for mixed problems and can generate non-physical, checkerboard-like pressure modes.\n2.  **Stable Formulations**: Switching to an LBB-stable element pair (like the P2-P1 Taylor-Hood element) or adding a stabilization term (e.g., Pressure-Stabilizing/Petrov-Galerkin, a.k.a. PSPG) are the standard, correct ways to cure this numerical pathology.\n3.  **Persistence and Convergence**: If the overshoot feature persists after the known source of instability is removed, and furthermore demonstrates convergence (i.e., becomes insensitive to further refinement), it is strong evidence that the feature is not an artifact of the initial, unstable formulation but a genuine part of the physical solution.\n\n**Verdict**: **Correct**. This is a standard and effective procedure for diagnosing and eliminating LBB-related numerical artifacts.\n\n**D. Using the same discretization choices (elements, quadrature, time integrator), solve the one-dimensional Terzaghi consolidation problem (drained boundary at one end, no-flow at the other) under comparable material parameters. If the Terzaghi test shows nonphysical pressure oscillations or overshoot, regard the discretization as suspect and treat the Mandel overshoot as potentially contaminated by numerical artifacts.**\n\nThis describes using a simpler, related problem as a diagnostic test.\n1.  **Terzaghi Problem Physics**: The 1D Terzaghi consolidation problem has a well-known analytical solution where the pore pressure decays monotonically in time from its initial value. It does *not* exhibit a physical pressure overshoot.\n2.  **Diagnostic Value**: Therefore, if a numerical scheme produces an overshoot or significant oscillations when solving the 1D Terzaghi problem, it indicates that the scheme itself is flawed and generates artifacts.\n3.  **Implication**: A numerical method that fails a simpler test case (Terzaghi) cannot be trusted to give reliable results for a more complex case (Mandel). The presence of artifacts in the Terzaghi simulation would immediately render the results of the Mandel simulation suspect, regardless of what they show. This is an essential sanity check.\n\n**Verdict**: **Correct**. This is a valid and important step in building confidence in a numerical scheme.\n\n**E. Add strong artificial numerical diffusion to the pressure equation (for example, aggressive mass lumping of the storage term or first-order upwinding of Darcy fluxes) until the overshoot disappears; the disappearance proves that the overshoot observed without added diffusion was physical.**\n\nThis logic is fallacious, much like option B.\n1.  **Effect of Artificial Diffusion**: Artificial diffusion is a numerical technique designed to damp high-frequency components of a solution. It damps both physical transients and non-physical numerical oscillations.\n2.  **Altering the Problem**: By adding \"strong\" diffusion, one is no longer solving the original governing equations but a modified, more diffusive set of equations. A physical pressure peak is a transient feature that will inevitably be smeared out and damped by sufficient artificial diffusion.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The fact that the overshoot disappears when diffusion is added proves nothing about its origin. It only proves that the added diffusion term is effective at damping peaks. This procedure cannot distinguish between a physical peak and a numerical one.\n\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The reasoning is fundamentally unsound.\n\n**F. Examine spatial pressure fields $p(x,H/2,t)$ across the width at several times while refining the mesh. If you observe element-to-element checkerboard patterns or short-wavelength oscillations whose wavelength tracks the mesh size $h$ and whose amplitude does not converge away under refinement or with an LBB-stable/stabilized formulation, classify the behavior as numerical artifact; if instead the pressure field is smooth with a single interior extremum that converges under refinement, accept the overshoot as physical.**\n\nThis procedure focuses on the spatial signature of numerical errors versus physical behavior.\n1.  **Signature of Numerical Instability**: LBB instability manifests as spurious, high-frequency (short-wavelength) oscillations in the pressure field. Their wavelength is tied to the element size ($h$), they often alternate signs between adjacent elements (\"checkerboarding\"), and they do not disappear with uniform mesh refinement. This is a classic visual diagnostic for unstable mixed methods.\n2.  **Signature of Physical Behavior**: A physical solution to the governing PDEs is expected to be smooth (assuming smooth data). A feature like the Mandel-Cryer overshoot would appear as a smooth, broad peak in the pressure field. Under mesh refinement, the numerical solution should converge to this smooth profile. A single, well-resolved interior maximum that is stable under refinement is characteristic of the physical effect.\nThis method provides a direct way to \"see\" the difference between grid-scale noise and a resolved physical phenomenon.\n\n**Verdict**: **Correct**. This is a standard and powerful diagnostic technique in FEM analysis.\n\nThe appropriate and sufficient steps for distinguishing the physical Mandel-Cryer overshoot from numerical artifacts are A, C, D, and F.\n-   **A** is a definitive verification against a benchmark.\n-   **C** addresses the root cause of the most common numerical artifact (LBB instability).\n-   **D** uses a simpler problem to check the basic integrity of the numerical scheme.\n-   **F** uses the spatial signature of the solution to diagnose grid-scale instabilities.\n\nSteps B and E are based on flawed logic and would lead to incorrect conclusions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "3540610"}]}
