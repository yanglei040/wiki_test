The problem statement is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principles of static equilibrium and Terzaghi's effective stress concept, which are cornerstones of soil mechanics. All provided data are physically realistic and sufficient to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive the vertical and horizontal effective stress distributions, $\\sigma'_{v}(z)$ and $\\sigma'_{h}(z)$, for a uniform soil deposit and then calculate their values at specified depths.\n\nFirst, we derive the vertical effective stress distribution, $\\sigma'_{v}(z)$. We begin from the principle of vertical static equilibrium for a continuum under self-weight. Let us consider an infinitesimal soil element of height $dz$ and unit horizontal area $A=1$, located at a depth $z$ below the ground surface. The $z$-axis is taken as positive downwards from the surface at $z=0$. In accordance with the geotechnical sign convention, compressive stresses are positive.\n\nThe forces acting on the element in the vertical direction are:\n$1$. The downward force on the top face due to the total vertical stress $\\sigma_v(z)$.\n$2$. The upward force on the bottom face due to the total vertical stress $\\sigma_v(z+dz)$.\n$3$. The downward force due to the element's self-weight, which is its volume ($A \\cdot dz = dz$) multiplied by the total unit weight of the soil, $\\gamma_t$.\n\nFor static equilibrium, the sum of vertical forces must be zero:\n$$ \\sigma_v(z) \\cdot A - \\sigma_v(z+dz) \\cdot A + \\gamma_t \\cdot A \\cdot dz = 0 $$\nDividing by the area $A$ and rearranging gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_v(z+dz) - \\sigma_v(z)}{dz} = \\gamma_t $$\nIn the limit as $dz \\to 0$, this becomes the differential equation for vertical equilibrium:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_v}{dz} = \\gamma_t $$\nTo find the total vertical stress $\\sigma_v(z)$, we integrate this equation from the ground surface ($z=0$) to an arbitrary depth $z$. The boundary condition is that the stress at the free surface is zero, i.e., $\\sigma_v(0)=0$.\n$$ \\int_{\\sigma_v(0)}^{\\sigma_v(z)} d\\sigma_v = \\int_0^z \\gamma_t d\\zeta $$\n$$ \\sigma_v(z) - 0 = \\gamma_t z $$\nThus, the total vertical stress at any depth $z$ is $\\sigma_v(z) = \\gamma_t z$.\n\nNext, we apply Terzaghi's effective stress principle, which states that total stress is the sum of effective stress and pore water pressure: $\\sigma = \\sigma' + u$.\nFor the vertical stresses, this is:\n$$ \\sigma_v(z) = \\sigma'_v(z) + u(z) $$\nThe soil is saturated and under stationary hydrostatic conditions, so the pore water pressure at depth $z$ is given by $u(z) = \\gamma_w z$, where $\\gamma_w$ is the unit weight of water. The total unit weight $\\gamma_t$ of a saturated soil is related to the effective (or buoyant) unit weight $\\gamma'$ by $\\gamma_t = \\gamma' + \\gamma_w$. Substituting these relationships into the equation for total stress:\n$$ \\sigma'_v(z) + \\gamma_w z = (\\gamma' + \\gamma_w) z $$\nSolving for the vertical effective stress $\\sigma'_v(z)$ yields:\n$$ \\sigma'_v(z) = (\\gamma' + \\gamma_w) z - \\gamma_w z = \\gamma' z $$\nThe problem provides a constant effective unit weight $\\gamma' = 10\\ \\text{kN/m}^3$. Thus, the vertical effective stress distribution is:\n$$ \\sigma'_{v}(z) = 10z $$\nwhere $z$ is in meters and $\\sigma'_{v}(z)$ is in kilopascals (kPa), since $1\\ \\text{kN/m}^2 = 1\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n\nSecond, we derive the horizontal effective stress distribution, $\\sigma'_{h}(z)$. The problem states that the soil is in an at-rest geostatic state, characterized by the coefficient of earth pressure at rest, $K_0$. By definition, $K_0$ is the ratio of the horizontal effective stress to the vertical effective stress:\n$$ K_0 = \\frac{\\sigma'_{h}}{\\sigma'_{v}} $$\nThis condition arises from the constraint of zero lateral strain ($\\epsilon_h=0$) during deposition and consolidation under self-weight.\nRearranging the definition, we find the horizontal effective stress:\n$$ \\sigma'_{h}(z) = K_0 \\sigma'_{v}(z) $$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\sigma'_{v}(z)$ and the given value $K_0 = 0.6$:\n$$ \\sigma'_{h}(z) = K_0 \\gamma' z = (0.6)(10)z = 6z $$\nwhere again, $z$ is in meters and $\\sigma'_{h}(z)$ is in kPa.\n\nFinally, we compute the required stress values at the specified depths $z=10\\ \\text{m}$, $z=30\\ \\text{m}$, and $z=50\\ \\text{m}$, and round the results to four significant figures.\n\nAt depth $z=10\\ \\text{m}$:\n$$ \\sigma'_{v}(10) = 10 \\times 10 = 100\\ \\text{kPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma'_{h}(10) = 0.6 \\times \\sigma'_{v}(10) = 0.6 \\times 100 = 60\\ \\text{kPa} $$\nRounded to four significant figures, these are $100.0\\ \\text{kPa}$ and $60.00\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n\nAt depth $z=30\\ \\text{m}$:\n$$ \\sigma'_{v}(30) = 10 \\times 30 = 300\\ \\text{kPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma'_{h}(30) = 0.6 \\times \\sigma'_{v}(30) = 0.6 \\times 300 = 180\\ \\text{kPa} $$\nRounded to four significant figures, these are $300.0\\ \\text{kPa}$ and $180.0\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n\nAt depth $z=50\\ \\text{m}$:\n$$ \\sigma'_{v}(50) = 10 \\times 50 = 500\\ \\text{kPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma'_{h}(50) = 0.6 \\times \\sigma'_{v}(50) = 0.6 \\times 500 = 300\\ \\text{kPa} $$\nRounded to four significant figures, these are $500.0\\ \\text{kPa}$ and $300.0\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing these six values in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 100.0 & 60.00 & 300.0 & 180.0 & 500.0 & 300.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3533868"}, {"introduction": "While calculating stresses with a given $K_0$ is straightforward, choosing the correct value for $K_0$ in practice reveals important subtleties in material modeling.

Derivation of $K_0$ from Isotropic Linear Elasticity**\n\nFor a saturated soil, strain is a function of effective stress. We begin with the generalized Hooke's law for an isotropic, linear elastic material, expressed in terms of effective stress components ($\\sigma'_{ij}$) and the corresponding drained elastic parameters (Young's modulus $E'$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu'$).

The vertical effective stress is denoted $\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{v}} = \\sigma'_{zz}$ and the horizontal effective stresses are equal, $\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}} = \\sigma'_{xx} = \\sigma'_{yy}$.\n\nThe \"at-rest\" or oedometer condition is defined by the constraint of zero lateral strain:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\epsilon_{yy} = 0\n$$\n\nLet's consider the strain component $\\epsilon_{xx}$. The constitutive relation gives:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E'} \\left[ \\sigma'_{xx} - \\nu' (\\sigma'_{yy} + \\sigma'_{zz}) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the geostatic effective stress conditions ($\\sigma'_{xx} = \\sigma'_{yy} = \\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}}$ and $\\sigma'_{zz} = \\sigma'_{\\mathrm{v}}$) and the oedometer strain condition ($\\epsilon_{xx} = 0$) into this equation yields:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{E'} \\left[ \\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}} - \\nu' (\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}} + \\sigma'_{\\mathrm{v}}) \\right]\n$$\nSince $E' \\neq 0$, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}} - \\nu' \\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}} - \\nu' \\sigma'_{\\mathrm{v}} = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for the ratio $\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}}/\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{v}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}}(1 - \\nu') = \\nu' \\sigma'_{\\mathrm{v}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}}}{\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{v}}} = \\frac{\\nu'}{1 - \\nu'}\n$$\nBy definition, $K_0 = \\sigma'_{\\mathrm{h}}/\\sigma'_{\\mathrm{v}}$. Therefore, the expression for the at-rest earth pressure coefficient based on linear elasticity is:\n$$\nK_{0,\\mathrm{elastic}} = \\frac{\\nu'}{1 - \\nu'}\n$$\n\n**2. Expression for $K_0$ based on Frictional Strength**\n\nFor normally consolidated frictional soils, a widely used and well-tested empirical correlation relates $K_0$ to the peak effective friction angle, $\\phi'$. This relationship, commonly known as Jaky's formula, is:\n$$\nK_{0,\\mathrm{friction}} = 1 - \\sin(\\phi')\n$$\nThis expression is rooted in plasticity theory and reflects the limiting equilibrium state of the soil during deposition and consolidation, making it a strength-based measure rather than an elasticity-based one.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Discrepancy $\\Delta K_0$**\n\nGiven the soil parameters $\\nu=\\nu'=0.3$ and $\\phi'=30^\\circ$.\n\nFirst, we compute the value of $K_{0,\\mathrm{elastic}}$:\n$$\nK_{0,\\mathrm{elastic}} = \\frac{0.3}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.3}{0.7} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the value of $K_{0,\\mathrm{friction}}$:\n$$\nK_{0,\\mathrm{friction}} = 1 - \\sin(30^\\circ)\n$$\nSince $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5$, we have:\n$$\nK_{0,\\mathrm{friction}} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n$$\n\nThe absolute discrepancy $\\Delta K_0$ is defined as $\\left|K_{0,\\mathrm{friction}}-K_{0,\\mathrm{elastic}}\\right|$.\n$$\n\\Delta K_0 = \\left| 0.5 - \\frac{3}{7} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{7} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{7 - 6}{14} \\right| = \\frac{1}{14}\n$$\nAs a decimal, $\\frac{1}{14} \\approx 0.07142857...$. Rounding to 4 significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta K_0 \\approx 0.07143\n$$\n\n**4. Discussion on FE Initialization**\n\nThe calculated discrepancy, $\\Delta K_0 \\approx 0.07143$, highlights a fundamental issue of consistency in computational geomechanics when using simple constitutive models like the linear-elastic perfectly-plastic Mohr-Coulomb model. Such models require both elastic parameters (e.g., $E'$, $\\nu'$) and plastic parameters (e.g., $c'$, $\\phi'$, $\\psi$) as independent inputs.\n\nThe initialization of a geostatic stress field is the first critical step in a finite element analysis. The goal is to establish an initial stress state that is in equilibrium with the body forces (gravity) and satisfies the boundary conditions (e.g., zero lateral displacement). The discrepancy arises because the elastic and plastic parameters imply different equilibrium stress states under the same geostatic conditions.\n\nIf one initializes the stresses using $K_0 = K_{0,\\mathrm{elastic}} = \\nu'/(1-\\nu') \\approx 0.4286$:\nThe initial effective stress state $(\\sigma'_v, \\sigma'_h)$ is perfectly consistent with the elastic constitutive law. When the FE solver applies gravity in the first computational step (a \"null\" step), the calculated elastic strains $\\epsilon_{xx}$ and $\\epsilon_{yy}$ will be exactly zero, as required by the oedometer condition. This means no spurious initial deformations or stress redistributions will occur. However, this value of $K_0$ may not accurately represent the real-world stress state of a normally consolidated soil, which is better described by its frictional properties.\n\nIf one initializes the stresses using $K_0 = K_{0,\\mathrm{friction}} = 1-\\sin\\phi' = 0.5$:\nThis initial stress state is geotechnically more realistic for a normally consolidated frictional soil. However, it is inconsistent with the specified elastic parameter $\\nu'=0.3$. When the FE solver performs its first equilibrium check, it will use the elastic parameters to compute the implicit strains corresponding to the initialized stresses. Since $\\sigma'_h / \\sigma'_v = 0.5 \\neq \\nu'/(1-\\nu')$, the solver will compute non-zero lateral elastic strains. This indicates that the initial stress state is not in elastic equilibrium, leading to an \"out-of-balance\" force vector. The solver will then attempt to correct this imbalance, resulting in small but non-physical initial deformations and stress readjustments across the model before any simulated construction or loading has begun.\n\nIn practice, this inconsistency is often managed in one of two ways:\n1.  Use the more realistic $K_0 = 1-\\sin\\phi'$, accept the small initial out-of-balance forces, and reset the initial displacements to zero after the first \"gravity loading\" step before proceeding with the main analysis.\n2.  Adjust one of the parameters to enforce consistency. For example, if $K_0=0.5$ is deemed correct, one might use a modified Poisson's ratio for initialization, $\\nu'_{\\text{init}}$, calculated by solving $0.5 = \\nu'_{\\text{init}} / (1 - \\nu'_{\\text{init}})$, which gives $\\nu'_{\\text{init}} = 1/3$. The analysis would then proceed with the true material parameter $\\nu'=0.3$.\n\nThis discrepancy underscores the limitations of simple constitutive models and the importance for the analyst to understand the theoretical basis of a model's parameters to ensure a valid and stable initial state for the numerical simulation. More advanced constitutive models, like hardening soil models, often incorporate stress-dependent stiffness, which inherently links the elastic and plastic responses, thus mitigating such inconsistencies.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.07143}\n$$", "id": "3533909"}, {"introduction": "Translating analytical stress calculations into a stable numerical model is a critical skill in computational geomechanics.

This step serves to verify that the initial state is correctly implemented.\n\nThe ideal geostatic state in a horizontally infinite soil layer is characterized by:\n1.  **Zero lateral strain:** $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\varepsilon_{yy} = 0$.\n2.  **Vertical equilibrium:** The total stresses must balance the body forces. The relevant component of the equilibrium equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\boldsymbol{b} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ is $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yz}}{\\partial y} + b_z = 0$. For a horizontally uniform layer, stresses do not vary with $x$ or $y$, and shear stresses are zero. With the z-axis pointing upwards, $b_z = -\\rho g$. Adopting the geomechanics convention of compression-positive stress, the equation simplifies to $\\frac{d\\sigma_{zz}}{dz} = -\\rho g$.\n3.  **Boundary Condition:** The top surface at $z=H$ is traction-free, so $\\sigma_{zz}(H) = 0$.\n4.  **Integration:** Integrating the equilibrium equation from $z$ to $H$ yields $\\sigma_{zz}(H) - \\sigma_{zz}(z) = \\int_z^H (-\\rho g) d\\zeta = -\\rho g (H-z)$. This gives the vertical total stress: $\\sigma_{zz}(z) = \\rho g (H-z)$.\n5.  **Pore Pressure:** In a saturated soil at rest, the pore water pressure $u(z)$ is typically hydrostatic. Given $u_0(H)$ at the top, the field is $u(z) = u_0(H) + \\rho_w g (H-z)$, where $\\rho_w$ is the density of water.\n6.  **Effective Stress:** Using the effective stress principle, the vertical effective stress is $\\sigma'_{zz}(z) = \\sigma_{zz}(z) - u(z)$.\n7.  **$K_0$ Condition:** The horizontal effective stresses are defined by the coefficient of earth pressure at rest, $K_0$: $\\sigma'_{xx}(z) = K_0 \\sigma'_{zz}(z)$. For a 2D plane strain problem, the out-of-plane effective stress $\\sigma'_{yy}$ is also related (e.g., for an isotropic elastic material, $\\sigma'_{yy}(z) = \\nu'(\\sigma'_{xx}(z) + \\sigma'_{zz}(z))$, where $\\nu'$ is the effective Poisson's ratio). The assumption that $\\sigma'_{yy} = K_0 \\sigma'_{zz}$ is a common simplification compatible with the general principle.\n8.  **Total Horizontal Stress:** $\\sigma_{xx}(z) = \\sigma'_{xx}(z) + u(z) = K_0 \\sigma'_{zz}(z) + u(z)$.\n\nA robust FEM procedure, therefore, involves defining this analytical stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0(z)$ and checking if it is in equilibrium with the body forces $\\boldsymbol{b}$ within the discretized model.

Assign this as a pre-existing stress state.\n2.  **Equilibrium Check:** Perform a static analysis step where the body force $\\boldsymbol{b}=\\rho\\boldsymbol{g}$ is applied. To prevent rigid-body motion, minimal kinematic constraints must be applied (e.g., fix $u_z=0$ at the base and fix $u_x=0$ at a single node). All other boundaries, particularly the lateral ones, should be free to displace.\n3.  **Verification:** If the initial stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0$ was calculated and implemented correctly, the nodal forces resulting from $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0$ will exactly balance the nodal forces from $\\boldsymbol{b}$. The solver should converge with calculated displacements and strains being approximately zero everywhere.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Precompute a self-equilibrated in-situ stress field...**\nThis option describes the ideal method outlined above. It correctly advocates for pre-computing an initial stress field based on analytical equilibrium ($K_0$ theory), assigning it to the elements, applying minimal constraints to prevent rigid body motion (notably, leaving lateral boundaries free), and then running an equilibrium step to verify that the initial state is indeed balanced. The verification step should result in near-zero displacements. This is the standard, most robust method used in professional practice for establishing geostatic conditions.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**. This option describes the most correct, comprehensive, and robust procedure among the choices.\n\n**B. Do not assign any initial stress. Impose roller boundary conditions $u_x=0$ along the entire lateral boundaries...**\nThis option describes a \"gravity switch-on\" method. By applying gravity to an initially stress-free body with constrained lateral boundaries ($u_x=0$), the model simulates the process of one-dimensional consolidation. This correctly enforces the condition $\\varepsilon_{xx} = 0$, leading to a final stress state that is consistent with the material's $K_0$ response. While this is a valid technique to *generate* the $K_0$ stresses, it has drawbacks. It induces large vertical deformations and strains, which must then be reset before subsequent analysis stages. Applying the full gravity load in a single step, as suggested, is often non-robust and can fail for non-linear materials. Most importantly, the question asks for a procedure to attain equilibrium \"without introducing spurious lateral strains.\" This procedure introduces very real and large vertical strains, which is a different outcome from the zero-strain verification sought in a true geostatic step. It is a method for generating the state, not verifying a pre-existing one without deformation.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This is a valid but less robust alternative method for *generating* geostatic stresses, not for initializing and verifying an equilibrium state without deformation, as implied by the problem's goal. It is not the most robust or desirable general procedure.\n\n**C. Do not assign initial stress and do not constrain lateral displacements...**\nThis procedure is fundamentally flawed. Applying gravity to an unconstrained, initially stress-free soil mass will cause it to deform both vertically (compress) and laterally (expand due to the Poisson effect). The model will \"slump\" outwards. The final state will not have zero lateral strain and therefore will not be a $K_0$ state. The lateral boundaries will be stress-free, which is incorrect for a slice of an infinite medium. This approach is physically wrong.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This procedure is conceptually flawed and will not produce the desired $K_0$ stress state.\n\n**D. Precompute hydrostatic total stresses $\\sigma_{xx}(z)=\\sigma_{yy}(z)=\\sigma_{zz}(z)=\\int_0^z \\rho g\\,dz$...**\nThis option makes two critical errors. First, it assumes an initial *isotropic* total stress state, where $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{zz}$. This implies an effective stress ratio $K_0 = \\sigma'_{xx}/\\sigma'_{zz} = 1$ (for a constant pore pressure), which is only true for very specific materials and conditions, and generally incorrect for soils. Second, it proposes to apply fixed lateral boundary conditions ($u_x=0$) on top of this pre-defined stress state. Applying kinematic constraints that are inconsistent with the assumed initial stresses will generate large, spurious reaction forces and stress redistribution. The system will not be in equilibrium and will undergo deformation to resolve this conflict.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This procedure is based on a physically unrealistic stress assumption ($K_0=1$) and then compounds the error with inconsistent boundary conditions.\n\n**E. Apply gravity via a pseudo-static relaxation...**\nThis describes a variant of a dynamic relaxation method. By making the material artificially soft and then gradually restoring its stiffness, the system can be guided to an equilibrium state. However, the boundary conditions specified are \"lateral boundaries free\". As in option C, this setup will lead to a slumped, deformed state with large lateral expansion, not the constrained $K_0$ condition. This technique is not suitable for establishing a geostatic state with zero lateral strain.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This procedure is ill-suited for the stated goal and will result in a physically incorrect state.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A describes the standard, most robust, and conceptually correct method for performing a geostatic equilibrium analysis in FEM. It correctly identifies the key elements: pre-computation of a theoretical $K_0$ stress field, assignment as an initial condition, use of minimal kinematic constraints, and verification via a zero-strain equilibrium check. Its description of the procedure is fundamentally correct, unlike the other options which contain significant conceptual flaws or describe less desirable methods.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3533944"}]}
