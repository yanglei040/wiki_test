All terms are well-defined within this context. The input data ($p'_0=100$ kPa, $\\mathrm{OCR}=2.5$) are physically realistic. The problem is self-contained and consistent. It asks for the calculation of model parameters and functions based on the provided data, which is a well-posed task. The requirement to express the final answer for the yield function value in terms of $M$ is consistent with $M$ being an unspecified parameter. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Action - Proceed to Solution\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the preconsolidation pressure $p_{c0}$ and the value of the yield function $f$ at the initial state. A rigorous assessment of the initial elastic state based on the sign of $f$ is also required.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the Overconsolidation Ratio ($\\mathrm{OCR}$) and the parameters of the Modified Cam Clay (MCC) model. The problem states that the $\\mathrm{OCR}$ is defined with respect to the mean effective stress under isotropic states. This is expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{OCR} = \\frac{p^{\\prime}_{\\text{max,iso}}}{p^{\\prime}_{\\text{current,iso}}}\n$$\nwhere $p^{\\prime}_{\\text{max,iso}}$ is the maximum mean effective stress the soil has experienced under isotropic conditions, and $p^{\\prime}_{\\text{current,iso}}$ is the current mean effective stress. From the problem statement, the current mean effective stress is $p^{\\prime}_{0} = 100$ kPa.\n\nThe parameter $p_{c0}$ in the MCC model represents the size of the yield surface, which is determined by the maximum stress state the soil has undergone. For an isotropic consolidation history, the maximum stress state was a normally consolidated isotropic state. A normally consolidated state must, by definition, lie on the yield surface. The standard MCC yield function is given as:\n$$\nf(p^{\\prime}, q, p_{c}) = q^2 + M^2 p'(p' - p_{c}) = 0\n$$\nAn isotropic state is characterized by zero deviatoric stress, $q = 0$. For a state to be both isotropic and normally consolidated, it must satisfy $q=0$ and $f=0$. Substituting $q=0$ into the yield function:\n$$\nM^2 p'(p^{\\prime} - p_{c}) = 0\n$$\nSince $M$ is a material constant ($M>0$) and for any non-trivial soil state $p^{\\prime} > 0$, this equation simplifies to:\n$$\np^{\\prime} - p_{c} = 0 \\implies p^{\\prime} = p_{c}\n$$\nThis result is a fundamental property of the MCC model: a normally consolidated isotropic state has a mean effective stress $p^{\\prime}$ equal to the value of the hardening parameter $p_{c}$.\n\nThe parameter $p_{c0}$ represents the size of the current yield surface, which was fixed by the maximum past mean effective stress, $p^{\\prime}_{\\text{max,iso}}$. Therefore, $p^{\\prime}_{\\text{max,iso}} = p_{c0}$.\n\nNow we can write the expression for the $\\mathrm{OCR}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{OCR} = \\frac{p_{c0}}{p^{\\prime}_{0}}\n$$\nUsing the given values, we can solve for $p_{c0}$:\n$$\n2.5 = \\frac{p_{c0}}{100 \\text{ kPa}}\n$$\n$$\np_{c0} = 2.5 \\times 100 \\text{ kPa} = 250 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nThis is the preconsolidation pressure at the initial state.\n\nNext, we determine the value of the yield function $f(p^{\\prime}_{0}, q=0, p_{c0})$ at the initial state. The initial state is given by $(p^{\\prime}, q) = (p^{\\prime}_{0}, 0) = (100 \\text{ kPa}, 0)$ and the yield surface is defined by $p_{c0} = 250 \\text{ kPa}$.\nSubstituting these values into the yield function:\n$$\nf(100, 0, 250) = (0)^2 + M^2(100)\\left(100 - 250\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf = M^2(100)(-150)\n$$\n$$\nf = -15000 M^2\n$$\nThe problem asks for this value in units of $\\text{kPa}^2$. Since $p^{\\prime}$ and $p_c$ are in kPa, the expression correctly has units of $\\text{kPa}^2$. The value is expressed in terms of the parameter $M$ as required.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether the initial state is elastic. In plasticity theory, the state of the material is determined by the sign of the yield function:\n-   $f < 0$: The stress state is inside the yield surface, and the material response is purely elastic.\n-   $f = 0$: The stress state is on the yield surface, and the material may undergo plastic deformation (yielding).\n-   $f > 0$: The stress state is outside the yield surface, which is an inadmissible state.\n\nIn our case, the value of the yield function is $f = -15000 M^2$. The critical state slope, $M$, is a positive material constant, so $M^2 > 0$. Consequently, the value of $f$ must be negative:\n$$\nf = -15000 M^2 < 0\n$$\nSince $f < 0$, the initial stress state $(p^{\\prime}_{0}, q=0)$ lies strictly inside the yield surface defined by $p_{c0}=250$ kPa. This confirms rigorously that the initial state of the soil is elastic. This is consistent with the problem's description of the soil as being \"overconsolidated\" ($\\mathrm{OCR}=2.5 > 1$).\n\nThe two requested values are the preconsolidation pressure $p_{c0}$ and the value of the yield function $f(p^{\\prime}_{0}, 0, p_{c0})$.\n-   $p_{c0} = 250$ kPa.\n-   $f(p^{\\prime}_{0}, 0, p_{c0}) = -15000 M^2$ kPa$^2$.\n\nThe final answer should be provided as a two-entry row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 250 & -15000 M^2 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3504967"}, {"introduction": "Knowing the boundaries of the elastic domain is essential, but the next practical step is to predict when a specific loading process will reach that boundary.

Under Modified Cam-Clay (MCC), the constitutive model is formulated in the space of invariants $p'$ and $q$, and uses an associated flow rule with an elliptical yield surface compatible with the critical state line.\n\nFirst, define the stress invariants. For axisymmetric triaxial states, the mean effective stress is $p' = (\\sigma'_1 + \\sigma'_2 + \\sigma'_3)/3$ and the deviatoric stress is $q = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{2}\\,\\mathbf{s}:\\mathbf{s}}$, with $\\mathbf{s}$ the deviatoric part of the effective stress tensor. These are standard definitions.\n\nThe Modified Cam-Clay model postulates an elliptical yield locus in the $p'$–$q$ plane that is tangent to the $p'$-axis at $p' = 0$ and at the preconsolidation pressure $p' = p'_{c}$, and consistent with the critical state condition $q = M p'$ at the apex of the ellipse. A widely accepted and equivalent form of the yield function is\n$$\nf(p',q,p'_{c}) \\equiv q^{2} + M^{2}\\,p'\\,(p' - p'_{c}) = 0,\n$$\nwhich defines the current yield surface. This form ensures that $f=0$ at $(p',q)=(0,0)$ and $(p',q)=(p'_{c},0)$, and that the maximum $q$ on the yield ellipse occurs at some $0 < p' < p'_{c}$ along a line consistent with the critical state slope $M$. The material is elastic for $f<0$, plastifies at $f=0$ with $df=0$ under loading, and unloads elastically for $df<0$.\n\nPart 1: Whether plastic flow can occur at constant $p'$.\nUnder a drained path at constant $p'$, the externally imposed boundary condition maintains $dp' = 0$. Plastic flow in MCC occurs if and only if the stress point reaches the yield locus $f=0$ and the loading direction is such that the consistency condition $df=0$ is satisfied with a positive plastic multiplier. Because MCC uses an associated flow rule, the plastic strain increment direction is normal to the yield surface in $p'$–$q$ space. The normal to the ellipse generally has nonzero components in both the $p'$ and $q$ directions except at special points. Therefore, when the stress point lies on $f=0$ and the deviatoric stress $q$ is increased while holding $p'$ fixed, plastic shearing can occur with a nonzero plastic multiplier as long as the loading direction projects positively onto the outward normal of the yield surface. In particular, at a fixed $p'$ between $0$ and $p'_{c}$, increasing $q$ toward the yield locus will initiate plastic flow once $q$ reaches its yield magnitude at that $p'$. Thus, MCC does allow plastic flow at constant $p'$ provided the state reaches the yield ellipse.\n\nPart 2: Condition on $q$ for yielding at a given $p'$ and $p'_{c}$.\nThe yield condition is given by $f=0$, namely\n$$\nq^{2} + M^{2}\\,p'\\,(p' - p'_{c}) = 0.\n$$\nSolving for the magnitude of the deviatoric stress $q$ on the yield locus at a specified $p'$ and current $p'_{c}$ yields\n$$\nq^{2} = M^{2}\\,p'\\,(p'_{c} - p').\n$$\nTaking the nonnegative principal value consistent with the usual definition of the deviatoric stress magnitude, we obtain\n$$\nq_{y}(M,p',p'_{c}) = M\\,\\sqrt{\\,p'\\,\\bigl(p'_{c} - p'\\bigr)\\,}.\n$$\nThis expression is physically admissible only if $0 \\leq p' \\leq p'_{c}$, ensuring that the argument of the square root is nonnegative and that the stress state lies within the domain of the ellipse in the $p'$–$q$ plane. For $p' = p'_{c}$, one has $q_{y} = 0$, corresponding to the isotropic normally consolidated state on the yield surface; for $p' = 0$, one also has $q_{y} = 0$, corresponding to the origin. For $0 < p' < p'_{c}$, $q_{y} > 0$ and plastic shearing can occur upon reaching this value under a drained constant $p'$ path.\n\nTherefore, the explicit closed-form expression for the deviatoric stress magnitude at yield is $q_{y}(M,p',p'_{c}) = M\\,\\sqrt{\\,p'\\,\\bigl(p'_{c} - p'\\bigr)\\,}$, and MCC permits plastic flow at constant $p'$ when this condition is met.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{M\\,\\sqrt{\\,p'\\,\\bigl(p'_{c}-p'\\bigr)\\,}}$$", "id": "3504983"}, {"introduction": "Once a soil yields, its deformation is governed by the plastic flow rule, which dictates the nature of its volume change during shearing.
