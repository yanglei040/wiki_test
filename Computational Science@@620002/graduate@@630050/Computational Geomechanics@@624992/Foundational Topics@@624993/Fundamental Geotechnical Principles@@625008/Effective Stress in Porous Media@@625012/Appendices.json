The first is to derive and compute the change in mean effective stress, $\\Delta p'$, between an initial and a final state. The second is to evaluate the final stress state with respect to the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion.\n\n**Task 1: Change in Mean Effective Stress, $\\Delta p'$}\n\nThe general principle of effective stress, as proposed by Biot, relates the effective stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$ to the total stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the pore fluid pressure $u$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - b u \\mathbf{I} $$\nwhere $b$ is the Biot coefficient and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n\nThe mean stress is defined as one-third of the trace of the corresponding stress tensor. The mean effective stress, $p'$, is therefore:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}') $$\nSubstituting the definition of the effective stress tensor into this expression gives:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - b u \\mathbf{I}) $$\nUsing the linearity of the trace operator:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) - \\mathrm{tr}(b u \\mathbf{I}) \\right) $$\nThe trace of the total stress tensor is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33}$. In the principal stress coordinate system, this becomes $\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3$. The trace of the identity tensor is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{I}) = 3$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{tr}(b u \\mathbf{I}) = 3bu$.\nSubstituting these results back, we get:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3) - bu $$\nThis can be written as $p' = p - bu$, where $p = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3)$ is the mean total stress.\n\nFor the given axisymmetric condition, the principal stresses are $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3$. The expression for $p'$ simplifies to:\n$$ p' = \\frac{\\sigma_1 + 2\\sigma_3}{3} - bu $$\nWe are asked to find the change in mean effective stress, $\\Delta p'$, between the initial state (superscript $i$) and the final state (superscript $f$):\n$$ \\Delta p' = p'^{(f)} - p'^{(i)} $$\n$$ \\Delta p' = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_1^{(f)} + 2\\sigma_3^{(f)}}{3} - b u^{(f)} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_1^{(i)} + 2\\sigma_3^{(i)}}{3} - b u^{(i)} \\right) $$\nWe can compute $p'^{(i)}$ and $p'^{(f)}$ separately.\n\nThe given data are:\nBiot coefficient: $b = 0.75$.\nInitial state: $\\sigma_{1}^{(i)} = 12 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\sigma_{3}^{(i)} = 12 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $u^{(i)} = 4 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\nFinal state: $\\sigma_{1}^{(f)} = 42 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\sigma_{3}^{(f)} = 18 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $u^{(f)} = 9 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the mean effective stress at the initial state, $p'^{(i)}$:\n$$ p'^{(i)} = \\frac{\\sigma_1^{(i)} + 2\\sigma_3^{(i)}}{3} - b u^{(i)} = \\frac{12 + 2(12)}{3} - (0.75)(4) $$\n$$ p'^{(i)} = \\frac{12 + 24}{3} - 3 = \\frac{36}{3} - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nNext, we compute the mean effective stress at the final state, $p'^{(f)}$:\n$$ p'^{(f)} = \\frac{\\sigma_1^{(f)} + 2\\sigma_3^{(f)}}{3} - b u^{(f)} = \\frac{42 + 2(18)}{3} - (0.75)(9) $$\n$$ p'^{(f)} = \\frac{42 + 36}{3} - 6.75 = \\frac{78}{3} - 6.75 = 26 - 6.75 = 19.25 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the change, $\\Delta p'$:\n$$ \\Delta p' = p'^{(f)} - p'^{(i)} = 19.25 - 9 = 10.25 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $10.25$ already has four significant figures.\n\n**Task 2: Evaluation of the Final State relative to the Mohr-Coulomb Yield Criterion**\n\nThe Mohr-Coulomb (MC) yield criterion in terms of principal effective stresses for triaxial compression ($\\sigma_1' \\ge \\sigma_3'$) is:\n$$ \\sigma_1' = \\sigma_3' \\frac{1 + \\sin\\phi'}{1 - \\sin\\phi'} + 2c' \\frac{\\cos\\phi'}{1 - \\sin\\phi'} $$\nwhere $c'$ is the effective cohesion and $\\phi'$ is the effective friction angle.\n\nWe need to express this criterion in the $(p', q)$ plane, where $p' = \\frac{\\sigma_1' + 2\\sigma_3'}{3}$ and $q = \\sigma_1' - \\sigma_3'$. From these definitions, we can express the principal effective stresses in terms of $p'$ and $q$:\n$$ \\sigma_1' = p' + \\frac{2}{3}q $$\n$$ \\sigma_3' = p' - \\frac{1}{3}q $$\nSubstituting these into the MC criterion gives the yield line in the $(p', q)$ plane. An equivalent and often more direct approach is to derive the line $q = M p' + q_0$ from the fundamental form of the criterion in terms of shear stress $\\tau$ and normal effective stress $\\sigma_n'$ on the failure plane: $\\tau = c' + \\sigma_n' \\tan\\phi'$. In principal stress space, this is equivalent to:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_1' - \\sigma_3'}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_1' + \\sigma_3'}{2} \\sin\\phi' + c'\\cos\\phi' $$\nSubstituting the invariants $p'$ and $q$, we have $\\sigma_1' - \\sigma_3' = q$ and $\\sigma_1' + \\sigma_3' = 2p' + q/3$. The criterion becomes:\n$$ \\frac{q}{2} = \\left(p' + \\frac{q}{6}\\right) \\sin\\phi' + c'\\cos\\phi' $$\nRearranging to solve for $q$:\n$$ q\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sin\\phi'}{6}\\right) = p' \\sin\\phi' + c'\\cos\\phi' $$\n$$ q\\left(\\frac{3 - \\sin\\phi'}{6}\\right) = p' \\sin\\phi' + c'\\cos\\phi' $$\n$$ q = \\left(\\frac{6 \\sin\\phi'}{3 - \\sin\\phi'}\\right) p' + \\left(\\frac{6 c' \\cos\\phi'}{3 - \\sin\\phi'}\\right) $$\nThis expression defines the yield value of $q$, let's call it $q_{yield}$, for a given $p'$.\n\nNow, we substitute the material parameters $\\phi' = 30^{\\circ}$ and $c' = 0.4 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$:\n$\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 0.5$ and $\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nThe slope of the yield line is:\n$$ M = \\frac{6 \\sin(30^{\\circ})}{3 - \\sin(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{6(0.5)}{3 - 0.5} = \\frac{3}{2.5} = 1.2 $$\nThe $q$-intercept of the yield line is:\n$$ q_0 = \\frac{6 c' \\cos(30^{\\circ})}{3 - \\sin(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{6(0.4)\\cos(30^{\\circ})}{2.5} = \\frac{2.4\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)}{2.5} = \\frac{1.2\\sqrt{3}}{2.5} \\approx 0.8314 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\nSo, the yield condition is $q_{yield} = 1.2 p' + \\frac{1.2\\sqrt{3}}{2.5}$.\n\nNext, we determine the stress point $(p'^{(f)}, q^{(f)})$ for the final state. We already calculated $p'^{(f)} = 19.25 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. Now we calculate $q^{(f)}$:\n$$ q^{(f)} = \\sigma_1'^{(f)} - \\sigma_3'^{(f)} $$\nThe final effective stresses are:\n$$ \\sigma_1'^{(f)} = \\sigma_1^{(f)} - b u^{(f)} = 42 - (0.75)(9) = 42 - 6.75 = 35.25 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_3'^{(f)} = \\sigma_3^{(f)} - b u^{(f)} = 18 - (0.75)(9) = 18 - 6.75 = 11.25 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\nTherefore, the deviatoric stress is:\n$$ q^{(f)} = 35.25 - 11.25 = 24.0 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe final stress state is at the point $(p', q) = (19.25, 24.0)$ in MPa.\n\nNow we evaluate the yield deviatoric stress $q_{yield}$ at $p'^{(f)} = 19.25 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$:\n$$ q_{yield} = 1.2 (19.25) + \\frac{1.2\\sqrt{3}}{2.5} = 23.1 + 0.8314... = 23.9314... \\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\nWe must compare the actual deviatoric stress $q^{(f)} = 24.0 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ with the yield value $q_{yield} \\approx 23.93 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\nSince $q^{(f)} > q_{yield}$, the final state lies outside the elastic domain defined by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. The yield function $f(p', q) = q - M p' - q_0$ would be positive for this state. In the context of rate-independent elastoplasticity, such a state is inadmissible, implying that plastic yielding must have occurred to reach this state, and the final state should lie on the yield surface, not beyond it. The problem is a static evaluation of a given stress state, and our conclusion is that this state is in the plastic domain.\nThe corresponding $q$-value of the MC yield line at the final $p'$ is $q_{yield} \\approx 23.93 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, which is less than the actual $q$ value of $24.0 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nThe question asks for only the numerical value from Task 1 as the final answer.\n\n$\\Delta p' = 10.25 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10.25}\n$$", "id": "3521093"}, {"introduction": "The classic effective stress concept must be extended to describe the behavior of unsaturated soils, where both water and air pressures act within the pores.

For quasi-static conditions, the balance of linear momentum for the mixture is given by $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$, where body forces are neglected for simplicity. The total Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, is the sum of the stress carried by the solid skeleton (the effective stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$) and the stress contributed by the fluid pressures in the pores.\n\nIn a saturated porous medium ($S_r=1$), where the pores are filled with a single fluid (water) at pressure $p_w$, Terzaghi's principle states that the effective stress is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p_{w}\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. This equation signifies that the pore water pressure acts equally in all directions (isotropically) and is fully supported by the fluid, not the solid skeleton.\n\nIn an unsaturated porous medium ($0 < S_r < 1$), two immiscible fluids, water and air, coexist in the pore space at pressures $p_w$ and $p_a$, respectively. To generalize the effective stress concept, we must account for the contribution of both fluid pressures. A widely used formulation is the Bishop-type effective stress law, which introduces a single effective pore pressure, $p_{eff}$, that combines the effects of $p_a$ and $p_w$. The effective stress tensor is then defined as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p_{eff}\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nBishop proposed the following form for the effective pore pressure:\n$$ p_{eff} = p_a - \\chi(p_a - p_w) $$\nwhere $\\chi$ is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the degree of saturation, material properties, and wetting history. The term $s = p_a - p_w$ is known as the matric suction.\n\nWe must verify that this formulation satisfies the required limits:\n1.  **Saturated limit ($S_r \\to 1$)**: As the soil approaches saturation, the air phase vanishes, and experimentally, the parameter $\\chi$ approaches $1$. Setting $\\chi=1$ in Bishop's law gives:\n    $$ p_{eff} = p_a - 1(p_a - p_w) = p_a - p_a + p_w = p_w $$\n    The effective stress becomes $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p_w\\boldsymbol{I}$, which is precisely Terzaghi's principle for saturated media.\n2.  **Dry limit ($S_r \\to 0$)**: As the soil becomes dry, the water phase vanishes, and the parameter $\\chi$ approaches $0$. Setting $\\chi=0$ gives:\n    $$ p_{eff} = p_a - 0(p_a - p_w) = p_a $$\n    The effective stress becomes $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p_a\\boldsymbol{I}$. This is the correct form for a porous medium filled with air at pressure $p_a$, where the total stress is reduced by the isotropic pressure of the gas phase.\n\nBoth limits are satisfied, confirming the physical consistency of the Bishop-type formulation.\n\n**1) Derivation of the expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$**\n\nThe problem specifies using the simplification $\\chi = S_r$. Substituting this into the general Bishop-type effective stress equation:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - (p_a - S_r(p_a - p_w))\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the weighted contribution of each fluid pressure:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - (p_a - S_r p_a + S_r p_w)\\boldsymbol{I} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - ((1 - S_r)p_a + S_r p_w)\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the effective stress tensor.

According to frictional failure models, such as the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, shear strength ($\\tau$) increases with effective normal stress ($\\sigma'_n$): $\\tau = c' + \\sigma'_n \\tan\\phi'$, where $c'$ is the effective cohesion and $\\phi'$ is the effective angle of internal friction.\n\nLet's examine the relationship between effective stress and matric suction, $s = p_a - p_w$. The effective stress expression is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - (p_a - \\chi s)\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nFor this analysis, we consider an increase in matric suction $s$ while holding other variables, notably $p_a$, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, and the parameter $\\chi$, constant as per the problem's direction. The change in any diagonal component of the effective stress tensor, $\\sigma'_{ii}$, with respect to suction $s$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{ii}}{\\partial s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} (\\sigma_{ii} - (p_a - \\chi s)) = \\chi $$\nSince $\\chi = S_r$, and the degree of saturation $S_r$ is non-negative ($0 \\le S_r \\le 1$), the parameter $\\chi$ is also non-negative. For an unsaturated soil ($S_r > 0$), we have $\\chi > 0$. Therefore, an increase in matric suction $s$ leads to a direct increase in the components of the effective stress tensor. This increases the effective normal stress on any plane within the soil mass. Consequently, based on a frictional failure model, the shear strength of the soil will increase.

Terzaghi Effective Stress Principle**\n\nThe Terzaghi effective stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{T}$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{T} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - u\\,\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. Given the diagonal form of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, the Terzaghi effective stress tensor is also diagonal:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{T} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_1-u & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_3-u & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_3-u \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe mean effective stress, $p'_\\mathrm{T}$, is one-third of the trace of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{T}$:\n$$\np'_\\mathrm{T} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{T}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( (\\sigma_1-u) + (\\sigma_3-u) + (\\sigma_3-u) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} (\\sigma_1 + 2\\sigma_3 - 3u)\n$$\n\nThe deviatoric stress tensor, $\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{T}$, is given by $\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{T} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{T} - p'_\\mathrm{T}\\mathbf{I}$. Its components are:\n$$\ns'_{T,11} = (\\sigma_1-u) - p'_\\mathrm{T} = \\frac{2}{3}(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)\n$$\n$$\ns'_{T,22} = s'_{T,33} = (\\sigma_3-u) - p'_\\mathrm{T} = -\\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)\n$$\nThe deviatoric stress is independent of the pore pressure $u$, as it only depends on the difference between total principal stresses.\n\nThe von Mises invariant, $q_\\mathrm{T}$, is defined as $q_\\mathrm{T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\,\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{T}:\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{T}}$. The double-dot product is the sum of the squares of the components:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{T}:\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{T} = (s'_{T,11})^2 + (s'_{T,22})^2 + (s'_{T,33})^2 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)\\right)^2 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{3}(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $q_\\mathrm{T}$:\n$$\nq_\\mathrm{T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3)^2} = |\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3|\n$$\nFor typical triaxial compression tests, $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_3$, so $q_\\mathrm{T} = \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3$.\n\n**2. General Tensorial Effective Stress Principle**\n\nThe general effective stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{G}$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{G} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\,u\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is the Biot effective stress coefficient tensor in the specimen coordinate system. It is obtained by rotating the Biot tensor from the material symmetry coordinates, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_\\mathrm{mat}$, using the provided rotation matrix $\\mathbf{R}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\mathbf{R}(\\theta)\\,\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_\\mathrm{mat}\\,\\mathbf{R}(\\theta)^\\top\n$$\nGiven $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_\\mathrm{mat}=\\mathrm{diag}\\!\\left(\\alpha_h,\\,\\alpha_h,\\,\\alpha_v\\right)$ and $\\mathbf{R}(\\theta)$, the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ are calculated as follows (letting $c = \\cos\\theta$ and $s = \\sin\\theta$):\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\begin{bmatrix} c & 0 & s \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -s & 0 & c \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_h & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\alpha_h & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\alpha_v \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} c & 0 & -s \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ s & 0 & c \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_h c^2 + \\alpha_v s^2 & 0 & (\\alpha_v - \\alpha_h)sc \\\\ 0 & \\alpha_h & 0 \\\\ (\\alpha_v - \\alpha_h)sc & 0 & \\alpha_h s^2 + \\alpha_v c^2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nWith $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ determined, the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{G}$ can be computed.\n\nThe mean effective stress, $p'_\\mathrm{G}$, is:\n$$\np'_\\mathrm{G} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{G}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}u) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) - u\\,\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})\\right)\n$$\nThe trace of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is $\\sigma_1 + 2\\sigma_3$. The trace of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is an invariant under rotation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = (\\alpha_h c^2 + \\alpha_v s^2) + \\alpha_h + (\\alpha_h s^2 + \\alpha_v c^2) = \\alpha_h(c^2+s^2) + \\alpha_v(s^2+c^2) + \\alpha_h = 2\\alpha_h + \\alpha_v\n$$\nThus, $p'_\\mathrm{G}$ is:\n$$\np'_\\mathrm{G} = \\frac{1}{3} (\\sigma_1 + 2\\sigma_3 - u(2\\alpha_h + \\alpha_v))\n$$\nThe deviatoric stress tensor is $\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{G} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{G} - p'_\\mathrm{G}\\mathbf{I}$. This tensor will generally have non-zero off-diagonal components if $\\alpha_h \\neq \\alpha_v$ and $\\theta$ is not a multiple of $90^\\circ$.\n\nThe von Mises invariant, $q_\\mathrm{G}$, is calculated using its definition:\n$$\nq_\\mathrm{G} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\,\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{G}:\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{G}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{G}:\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{G} = \\sum_{i,j} (s'_{G,ij})^2$. Computationally, it is straightforward to construct the tensors $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'_\\mathrm{G}$ numerically, then compute $p'_\\mathrm{G}$, $\\mathbf{s}'_\\mathrm{G}$, and finally $q_\\mathrm{G}$.\n\n**Algorithm for Implementation**\n\nFor each parameter set $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_3, u, \\alpha_h, \\alpha_v, \\theta)$:\n1.  Convert the angle $\\theta$ from degrees to radians.\n2.  Calculate $p'_\\mathrm{T} = (\\sigma_1 + 2\\sigma_3 - 3u)/3$.\n3.  Calculate $q_\\mathrm{T} = \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3$.\n4.
