The initial average vertical effective stress is $\\sigma^{\\prime}_{0} = 120$ kPa, and the final average vertical effective stress after load application is $\\sigma^{\\prime}_{f} = 240$ kPa. The layer is drained only at the top boundary (single drainage), and the bottom boundary is impermeable. The initial void ratio is $e_{0} = 0.9$, and the clay’s compressibility in the normally consolidated range is characterized by the compression index $C_{c} = 0.45$. Neglect secondary compression. \n\nStarting from the one-dimensional consolidation framework, the definition of void ratio $e$ as the ratio of void volume to solid volume, the assumption of incompressible soil solids, and the standard description of compressibility for normally consolidated clays in terms of the compression index, derive the expression for the end-of-primary consolidation settlement of the layer and compute its value for the given data. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in meters.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the expression for the end-of-primary consolidation settlement, $S_c$, of a saturated clay layer from fundamental principles and its subsequent calculation.\n\nLet $H$ be the total thickness of the clay layer and $A$ be its cross-sectional area. The total volume of the soil specimen is $V = H \\cdot A$. This total volume is the sum of the volume of the solid soil particles, $V_s$, and the volume of the voids (filled with water), $V_v$.\n$$ V = V_s + V_v $$\nThe void ratio, $e$, is defined as the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solids:\n$$ e = \\frac{V_v}{V_s} $$\nFrom this definition, the volume of voids can be expressed as $V_v = e \\cdot V_s$. Substituting this into the expression for the total volume gives:\n$$ V = V_s + e \\cdot V_s = V_s (1 + e) $$\nSince $V=H \\cdot A$, we can establish a relationship between the layer's thickness and its void ratio:\n$$ H \\cdot A = V_s (1 + e) \\implies H = \\frac{V_s}{A}(1+e) $$\nThe problem describes a one-dimensional consolidation process. This implies that the cross-sectional area $A$ remains constant. Furthermore, the problem assumes incompressible soil solids, which means the volume of solids $V_s$ is also constant. Consequently, any change in the thickness $H$ of the layer is solely due to a change in its void ratio $e$.\n\nThe total settlement, $S_c$, is the reduction in the thickness of the layer, which is the difference between the initial thickness, $H_0$, and the final thickness after consolidation, $H_f$.\n$$ S_c = H_0 - H_f $$\nUsing the relationship between thickness and void ratio for the initial and final states:\n$$ S_c = \\frac{V_s}{A}(1 + e_0) - \\frac{V_s}{A}(1 + e_f) $$\nwhere $e_0$ is the initial void ratio and $e_f$ is the final void ratio. Factoring out the constant term $\\frac{V_s}{A}$:\n$$ S_c = \\frac{V_s}{A} [(1 + e_0) - (1 + e_f)] = \\frac{V_s}{A} (e_0 - e_f) $$\nLet the change in void ratio be denoted by $\\Delta e = e_0 - e_f$. To eliminate the unknown term $\\frac{V_s}{A}$, we express it in terms of the initial state of the layer: $H_0 = \\frac{V_s}{A}(1 + e_0)$, which yields $\\frac{V_s}{A} = \\frac{H_0}{1 + e_0}$.\nSubstituting this back into the settlement equation provides the first key relationship:\n$$ S_c = \\frac{H_0}{1 + e_0} \\Delta e $$\nNext, we need to relate the change in void ratio, $\\Delta e$, to the change in effective stress. The problem states that the clay is normally consolidated and its compressibility is characterized by the compression index, $C_c$. For a normally consolidated clay, the relationship between void ratio $e$ and the logarithm of the vertical effective stress $\\sigma'$ is linear. The compression index $C_c$ is defined as the negative of the slope of the virgin compression line on a semi-logarithmic plot of $e$ versus $\\log_{10}(\\sigma')$:\n$$ C_c = - \\frac{\\Delta e}{\\Delta (\\log_{10} \\sigma')} = - \\frac{e_f - e_0}{\\log_{10}(\\sigma'_f) - \\log_{10}(\\sigma'_0)} $$\nThe negative sign is conventional, making $C_c$ a positive constant since $e_f < e_0$ for an increase in stress $\\sigma'_f > \\sigma'_0$. Rearranging the equation to solve for the change in void ratio, $\\Delta e = e_0 - e_f$:\n$$ C_c = \\frac{e_0 - e_f}{\\log_{10}(\\sigma'_f) - \\log_{10}(\\sigma'_0)} = \\frac{\\Delta e}{\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_f}{\\sigma'_0}\\right)} $$\n$$ \\implies \\Delta e = C_c \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_f}{\\sigma'_0}\\right) $$\nFinally, by substituting this expression for $\\Delta e$ into the equation for $S_c$, we arrive at the complete formula for the primary consolidation settlement of a normally consolidated clay layer:\n$$ S_c = \\frac{H_0}{1 + e_0} \\left[ C_c \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_f}{\\sigma'_0}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis concludes the derivation as requested.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the settlement using the given data:\nInitial layer thickness, $H_0 = 10$ m.\nInitial void ratio, $e_0 = 0.9$.\nCompression index, $C_c = 0.45$.\nInitial average vertical effective stress, $\\sigma'_{0} = 120$ kPa.\nFinal average vertical effective stress, $\\sigma'_{f} = 240$ kPa.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ S_c = \\frac{10}{1 + 0.9} \\left[ 0.45 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{240}{120}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ S_c = \\frac{10}{1.9} \\left[ 0.45 \\log_{10}(2) \\right] $$\n$$ S_c = \\frac{4.5}{1.9} \\log_{10}(2) $$\nUsing a calculator for the values:\n$$ S_c \\approx (2.368421...) \\times (0.45 \\times 0.30102999...) $$\n$$ S_c \\approx (2.368421...) \\times (0.1354635...) $$\n$$ S_c \\approx 0.712972... \\text{ m} $$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ S_c = 0.7130 \\text{ m} $$\nThe information provided about single drainage influences the time required for this settlement to occur but not its total magnitude.

The layer thickness is $H=6\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions are as follows:\n- **Initial Condition (IC)**: At $t=0$, the excess pore pressure is uniform: $u(z, 0) = u_0$ for $0 \\le z \\le H$.\n- **Boundary Conditions (BCs)**:\n    1. At the impermeable top boundary ($z=0$), there is no flow, so the hydraulic gradient is zero. By Darcy's Law, this implies $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}(0, t) = 0$ for $t > 0$.\n    2. At the permeable bottom boundary ($z=H$), the excess pore pressure dissipates completely: $u(H, t) = 0$ for $t > 0$.\n\nTo generalize the solution, we introduce dimensionless variables.\n- **Maximum Drainage Path ($H_{dr}$)**: For single drainage, the longest path a water particle must travel to exit the layer is the full thickness of the layer. Thus, $H_{dr} = H$.\n- **Dimensionless Time (Time Factor, $T_v$)**: $T_v = \\frac{c_v t}{H_{dr}^2} = \\frac{c_v t}{H^2}$.\n- **Dimensionless Depth ($Z$)**: $Z = \\frac{z}{H_{dr}} = \\frac{z}{H}$.\n- **Degree of Consolidation at a point ($U_z$)**: $U_z = 1 - \\frac{u(z,t)}{u_0}$.

The condition $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial Z}(0, T_v)=0$ is satisfied by the cosine function.

First, we find the corresponding time factor $T_v$. For $U > 0.6$, the series converges rapidly, and accurate approximations exist. A standard value derived from the series solution for $U = 0.90$ is $T_v \\approx 0.848$.

The problem states this is a diffusion process. According to Terzaghi's theory, the strain evolves in proportion to the average degree of consolidation, $U(t)$, which is a function of the time factor $T_v = c_v t / H_{dr}^2$, where $c_v$ is the coefficient of consolidation and $H_{dr}$ is the drainage path length. As $t \\rightarrow \\infty$, $U(t) \\rightarrow 1$, and the primary strain approaches its final value, $\\varepsilon_{p,\\infty}$. On a plot of strain versus the logarithm of time, this process produces a characteristic 'S'-shaped curve.\n\n2.  **Secondary Compression ($\\varepsilon_s(t)$):** This component is described as time-dependent creep under constant effective stress, which becomes the dominant mechanism after excess pore pressures have substantially dissipated (i.e., for $t > t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$). The problem states this behavior is \"approximately logarithmic in time\". This corresponds to the standard definition of the coefficient of secondary compression, $C_{\\alpha}$, which is the slope of the void ratio versus log-time curve in the secondary compression range:\n    $$ C_{\\alpha} = - \\frac{de}{d(\\log_{10} t)} $$\n    For strain, the relationship involves the secondary compression index $C'_{\\alpha} = C_{\\alpha}/(1+e_0)$, where $e_0$ is the initial void ratio. On a semi-log plot, pure secondary compression appears as a straight line.\n\nThe total response curve is a superposition of these two behaviors. Graphical methods to estimate $C_{\\alpha}$ require first identifying the EOP time, $t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, to distinguish the \"end\" of the primary S-curve from the \"start\" of the secondary linear segment. The subjectivity of this graphical identification is a primary source of error.\n\n**Analysis of Bias:**\n\n-   **Case 1: Early EOP Selection ($t^{\\ast} < t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$)**\n    If the analyst selects an EOP time $t^{\\ast}$ that is too early, the time interval immediately following $t^{\\ast}$ still includes a significant contribution from primary consolidation. The rate of strain (the slope on the strain-log time plot) in this interval is the sum of the rate from secondary compression and the remaining rate from primary consolidation. Since the primary consolidation is still ongoing, its contribution to the slope is positive. Therefore, the total slope measured by the analyst will be steeper than the slope due to secondary compression alone. This leads to an overestimation of the secondary compression rate.\n    **Conclusion: The estimated $C_{\\alpha}$ is biased high.**\n\n-   **Case 2: Late EOP Selection ($t^{\\ast} > t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$)**\n    If the analyst selects an EOP time $t^{\\ast}$ that is too late, they are fitting a line to a segment of the curve that is well into the secondary compression phase. The transition from the primary-dominant S-curve to the secondary-dominant linear portion is smooth and continuous. The slope of the total strain vs. log-time curve gradually increases, asymptotically approaching the final, constant slope associated with secondary compression. If $t^{\\ast}$ is chosen too late, but the fitting line is still based on data points in the transition zone just after the true $t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, these points lie on a part of the curve whose slope is still less than the final asymptotic slope. This is because the curve is concave up (for settlement vs log time). Fitting a line to this still-developing region results in an underestimation of the true, final slope. The phrasing in Option A, \"some early secondary strain is absorbed into primary,\" is a slightly imprecise but conceptually equivalent way of saying that the chosen analysis window misinterprets part of the secondary curve as belonging to the primary/transition phase, leading to a fit on the flatter, initial part of the secondary curve.\n    **Conclusion: The estimated $C_{\\alpha}$ is biased low.**\n\n**Correction Strategy:**\n\nThe root of the problem is the artificial separation of a continuous, coupled process into two sequential parts via a subjective graphical construction. A scientifically superior approach must abandon this separation. The correction should involve:\n1.  Formulating a mathematical model that describes the entire time history of strain by combining both the diffusion-driven primary consolidation and the time-dependent secondary creep. For example: $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{p,\\infty} U(c_v t / H_{dr}^2) + \\varepsilon_{s}(t; C_{\\alpha}, ...)$.\n2.  Using the full experimental dataset (all strain-time pairs) to determine the unknown model parameters ($c_v$, $\\varepsilon_{p,\\infty}$, $C_{\\alpha}$, etc.).\n3.  Employing a robust statistical fitting technique, such as nonlinear least squares, to find the parameter values that minimize the difference between the model's prediction and the experimental data.\n\nThis **joint parameter estimation** approach utilizes all available information, correctly models the coupled nature of the physical processes, and eliminates the subjective, error-prone step of selecting an EOP.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. If $t^{\\ast} < t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, some primary strain is misattributed to secondary, so the estimated $C_{\\alpha}$ is biased high; if $t^{\\ast} > t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, some early secondary strain is absorbed into primary, so the estimated $C_{\\alpha}$ is biased low.

The proposed correction strategy—jointly fitting a combined diffusion-creep model to the entire dataset using nonlinear least squares to estimate all parameters simultaneously—is precisely the scientifically sound method to overcome the limitations of graphical EOP selection. The parameters listed for estimation are appropriate for such a model.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $t^{\\ast} < t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, the estimated $C_{\\alpha}$ is biased low because the secondary slope is measured over too short a time; if $t^{\\ast} > t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, the estimated $C_{\\alpha}$ is biased high. A correction is to fix the coefficient of consolidation $c_{v}$ from a separate permeability test and iteratively adjust $t^{\\ast}$ until the measured $C_{\\alpha}$ matches an empirical ratio to the compression index, without fitting a joint model.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The bias directions are stated incorrectly (they are the reverse of the correct directions). The correction strategy is unscientific; it relies on a non-universal empirical correlation ($C_{\\alpha}/C_c$ ratio) and still depends on finding a discrete EOP point ($t^{\\ast}$), thus not solving the fundamental problem. Avoiding a joint model is a methodological flaw.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The choice of EOP does not bias the estimated $C_{\\alpha}$ if the log-time method is applied carefully. A correction is unnecessary; alternatively, subtract a primary curve extrapolated by the square-root-of-time method and compute $C_{\\alpha}$ from the residual regardless of EOP.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The initial claim that EOP choice does not cause bias is fundamentally false; it is a well-known issue. The alternative correction is another form of graphical separation, not a coupled analysis. Extrapolating the square-root-of-time fit (valid for the initial stage) across the entire process is a questionable procedure that again decouples what should be a coupled model.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $t^{\\ast} < t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, the estimated $C_{\\alpha}$ is biased high; if $t^{\\ast} > t_{\\mathrm{EOP}}$, it is biased low.

However, the correction strategy is flawed in two major ways. First, it proposes an exponential secondary law (from a Kelvin-Voigt element), which contradicts the problem's given principle of \"approximately logarithmic in time\" creep. Second, it proposes sequential estimation on disjoint time windows, which is the very procedure that necessitates choosing an EOP and is the source of the problem. A proper correction must be a a joint, not sequential, fit.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3552761"}]}
