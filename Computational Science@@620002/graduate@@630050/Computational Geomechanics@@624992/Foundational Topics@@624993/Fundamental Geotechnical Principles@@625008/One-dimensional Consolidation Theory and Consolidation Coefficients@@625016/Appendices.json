It outlines a standard derivation in geotechnical engineering.\n\nThe derivation of the one-dimensional consolidation equation proceeds by combining three fundamental principles: mass conservation (continuity), a flow law (Darcy's law), and a constitutive stress-strain relationship.\n\n1.  **Continuity Equation:**\n    Let us consider a representative elementary volume of saturated soil. In one-dimensional consolidation, fluid flow and deformation occur only in the vertical direction, which we denote by the coordinate $z$. We adopt the sign convention where compressive stresses and strains are positive. The rate of volumetric compression, or the rate of decrease in the volume of the element per unit volume, must be equal to the rate at which water is expelled from the element per unit volume. The rate of water expulsion is given by the divergence of the seepage velocity vector. For one-dimensional flow along the $z$-axis, this is $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}$, where $v_z$ is the seepage velocity. Therefore, the continuity equation is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_v}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}\n    $$\n    where $\\epsilon_v$ is the volumetric strain and $t$ is time.\n\n2.  **Darcy's Law:**\n    Darcy's law states that the seepage velocity is proportional to the hydraulic gradient, $i$. The constant of proportionality is the hydraulic conductivity, $k$.\n    $$\n    v_z = k i\n    $$\n    The hydraulic gradient is the spatial rate of change of total head, $h$. Flow is driven by the gradient in total head. However, in consolidation, the flow is caused by the dissipation of excess pore water pressure, $u_e$. The total head $h$ is the sum of the elevation head and the pressure head. The gradient of the hydrostatic pressure component is balanced by the elevation head gradient, so the hydraulic gradient responsible for flow reduces to the gradient of the excess pressure head:\n    $$\n    i = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( \\frac{u_e}{\\gamma_w} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial z}\n    $$\n    where $\\gamma_w$ is the unit weight of water. The negative sign indicates that flow occurs in the direction of decreasing head. Substituting this into Darcy's law gives the seepage velocity:\n    $$\n    v_z = - \\frac{k}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial z}\n    $$\n    Substituting this expression for $v_z$ into the continuity equation yields a relationship between the volumetric strain rate and the excess pore pressure:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_v}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( - \\frac{k}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial z} \\right) = - \\frac{k}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial^2 u_e}{\\partial z^2}\n    $$\n    This assumes that $k$ and $\\gamma_w$ are constant with respect to the spatial coordinate $z$.\n\n3.  **Constitutive Law and Effective Stress Principle:**\n    The problem states that the soil skeleton deforms according to a linear volumetric compressibility, characterized by the coefficient of volume compressibility, $m_v$. This coefficient relates the change in volumetric strain, $d\\epsilon_v$, to the change in effective stress, $d\\sigma'$.\n    $$\n    d\\epsilon_v = m_v d\\sigma'\n    $$\n    In rate form, this is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_v}{\\partial t} = m_v \\frac{\\partial \\sigma'}{\\partial t}\n    $$\n    According to Terzaghi's effective stress principle, the total stress $\\sigma$ is the sum of the effective stress $\\sigma'$ and the pore water pressure $u$. During consolidation, the change in total stress, $\\Delta\\sigma$, is partitioned between the change in effective stress, $\\Delta\\sigma'$, and the excess pore water pressure, $u_e$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta\\sigma = \\Delta\\sigma' + u_e\n    $$\n    The problem states that the applied total stress is maintained constant. Therefore, its rate of change with respect to time is zero: $\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta\\sigma)}{\\partial t} = 0$. Differentiating the effective stress relation with respect to time gives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta\\sigma)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta\\sigma')}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial t} = 0\n    $$\n    This implies:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta\\sigma')}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial t}\n    $$\n    Substituting this result into the rate form of the constitutive law:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_v}{\\partial t} = m_v \\left( - \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial t} \\right) = -m_v \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial t}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Consolidation Equation and Identification of $c_v$:**\n    We now have two expressions for the volumetric strain rate, $\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_v}{\\partial t}$. Equating them yields:\n    $$\n    - \\frac{k}{\\gamma_w} \\frac{\\partial^2 u_e}{\\partial z^2} = -m_v \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial t}\n    $$\n    Rearranging the terms, we obtain the one-dimensional consolidation equation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial t} = \\left( \\frac{k}{m_v \\gamma_w} \\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 u_e}{\\partial z^2}\n    $$\n    This is a form of the diffusion equation. The term in parentheses is a material property that governs the rate of consolidation and is defined as the coefficient of consolidation, $c_v$.\n    $$\n    c_v = \\frac{k}{m_v \\gamma_w}\n    $$\n\n5.  **First-Order Relative Error Propagation:**\n    We are asked to find the first-order relative error propagation for $c_v$, given that $c_v$ is a function of the measured quantities $k$ (hydraulic conductivity) and $m_v$ (coefficient of volume compressibility). The unit weight of water, $\\gamma_w$, is treated as a constant with negligible uncertainty.\n\n    The relationship is $c_v = \\frac{k}{m_v \\gamma_w}$. To find the relative error propagation, we can use the method of logarithmic differentiation, which is equivalent to a first-order Taylor expansion for relative errors. Taking the natural logarithm of the expression for $c_v$:\n    $$\n    \\ln(c_v) = \\ln(k) - \\ln(m_v) - \\ln(\\gamma_w)\n    $$\n    Taking the total differential of this expression:\n    $$\n    d(\\ln(c_v)) = d(\\ln(k)) - d(\\ln(m_v)) - d(\\ln(\\gamma_w))\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{dc_v}{c_v} = \\frac{dk}{k} - \\frac{dm_v}{m_v} - \\frac{d\\gamma_w}{\\gamma_w}\n    $$\n    For small, finite measurement errors, we can approximate the differentials ($d$) with small changes ($\\delta$). Let $\\delta k$ and $\\delta m_v$ be the errors in the measurements of $k$ and $m_v$, and let $\\delta c_v$ be the resulting error in the calculated $c_v$. The error in $\\gamma_w$ is negligible, so $\\delta \\gamma_w = 0$. The first-order approximation for the propagation of errors is thus:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\delta c_v}{c_v} \\approx \\frac{\\delta k}{k} - \\frac{\\delta m_v}{m_v}\n    $$\n    This expression relates the relative error in the consolidation coefficient, $\\frac{\\delta c_v}{c_v}$, to the relative errors in the measured parameters, $\\frac{\\delta k}{k}$ and $\\frac{\\delta m_v}{m_v}$.\n\n6.  **Discussion of Sensitivity:**\n    The derived error propagation formula, $\\frac{\\delta c_v}{c_v} \\approx \\frac{\\delta k}{k} - \\frac{\\delta m_v}{m_v}$, reveals the sensitivity of the calculated coefficient of consolidation to measurement uncertainties. The sensitivity of the relative error in $c_v$ to the relative error in $k$ is $+1$, while the sensitivity to the relative error in $m_v$ is $-1$.\n\n    This means that a given percentage error in the hydraulic conductivity, $k$, results in the same percentage error in $c_v$ and in the same direction. For example, a $5\\%$ overestimation of $k$ leads to a $5\\%$ overestimation of $c_v$. This is physically intuitive, as a more permeable soil (higher $k$) consolidates faster (higher $c_v$).\n\n    Conversely, a given percentage error in the coefficient of volume compressibility, $m_v$, results in the same percentage error in $c_v$ but in the opposite direction. For example, a $5\\%$ overestimation of $m_v$ leads to a $5\\%$ underestimation of $c_v$. This is also physically consistent, as a more compressible soil (higher $m_v$) requires more water to be expelled for a given stress change, which typically corresponds to a slower consolidation process (lower $c_v$).\n\n    An important consequence is the potential for either error cancellation or amplification. If both $k$ and $m_v$ are overestimated by the same relative amount, their effects on the error in $c_v$ will cancel out. However, if one is overestimated and the other is underestimated, their effects will be additive, leading to a larger relative error in $c_v$. Specifically, the maximum possible magnitude of the relative error in $c_v$ is the sum of the magnitudes of the relative errors in $k$ and $m_v$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\delta c_v}{c_v} = \\frac{\\delta k}{k} - \\frac{\\delta m_v}{m_v}}\n$$", "id": "3547274"}, {"introduction": "With a solid grasp of the governing equation, we can now apply it to predict a key engineering outcome: settlement over time.

Governing Equation and Boundary Conditions**\nTerzaghi's one-dimensional consolidation equation governs the dissipation of excess pore pressure, $u$, with time, $t$, and depth, $z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c_v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} $$\nFor a layer of thickness $H$ with double drainage, the maximum drainage path length is $H_d = H/2$. We set up a coordinate system with $z=0$ at the center of the clay layer and drainage boundaries at $z = \\pm H_d$. Due to symmetry, the problem can be solved over the domain $z \\in [0, H_d]$.\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions are:\n- Initial condition (at $t=0$): The applied stress is carried entirely by the pore fluid. $u(z, 0) = u_0 = \\Delta \\sigma'$.\n- Boundary conditions (for $t>0$):\n    - No flow at the center of the layer (by symmetry): $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}(0, t) = 0$.\n    - Full drainage at the boundary: $u(H_d, t) = 0$.\n\n**2. Eigenfunction Series Solution for $u(z,t)$**\nUsing the method of separation of variables, the solution for $u(z,t)$ is an eigenfunction series (a Fourier series):\n$$ u(z,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_m \\cos\\left(\\frac{M_m z}{H_d}\\right) \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v) $$\nwhere $M_m = \\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2}$ are the eigenvalues, and $T_v = \\frac{c_v t}{H_d^2}$ is the dimensionless time factor.\nThe coefficients $C_m$ are found from the initial condition $u(z,0) = u_0$:\n$$ C_m = \\frac{\\int_0^{H_d} u_0 \\cos\\left(\\frac{M_m z}{H_d}\\right) dz}{\\int_0^{H_d} \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{M_m z}{H_d}\\right) dz} = \\frac{u_0 \\left[\\frac{H_d}{M_m} \\sin\\left(\\frac{M_m z}{H_d}\\right)\\right]_0^{H_d}}{H_d/2} = \\frac{2u_0}{M_m} \\sin(M_m) $$\nSince $M_m = (m-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$, $\\sin(M_m) = (-1)^{m-1}$.\n$$ C_m = \\frac{2u_0 (-1)^{m-1}}{M_m} = \\frac{4u_0 (-1)^{m-1}}{(2m-1)\\pi} $$\nSubstituting $C_m$ back, the excess pore pressure is:\n$$ u(z,t) = \\frac{4u_0}{\\pi} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{m-1}}{2m-1} \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi z}{2H_d}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2}\\right)^2 T_v\\right) $$\n\n**3. Spatially Averaged Excess Pore Pressure and Degree of Consolidation**\nThe spatially averaged excess pore pressure, $\\bar{u}(t)$, over the full thickness $H=2H_d$ is:\n$$ \\bar{u}(t) = \\frac{1}{H_d} \\int_0^{H_d} u(z,t) dz $$\nIntegrating the series term-by-term:\n$$ \\int_0^{H_d} \\cos\\left(\\frac{M_m z}{H_d}\\right) dz = \\left[\\frac{H_d}{M_m} \\sin\\left(\\frac{M_m z}{H_d}\\right)\\right]_0^{H_d} = \\frac{H_d}{M_m} \\sin(M_m) = \\frac{H_d}{M_m}(-1)^{m-1} $$\nThus,\n$$ \\bar{u}(t) = \\frac{1}{H_d} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_m \\left(\\frac{H_d}{M_m}(-1)^{m-1}\\right) \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{C_m (-1)^{m-1}}{M_m} \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v) $$\n$$ \\bar{u}(t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2u_0 (-1)^{m-1}}{M_m} \\frac{(-1)^{m-1}}{M_m} \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2u_0}{M_m^2} \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v) $$\nSubstituting $M_m = \\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2}$:\n$$ \\bar{u}(t) = \\frac{8u_0}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2}\\right)^2 T_v\\right) $$\nThe average degree of consolidation, $U(t)$, is the ratio of consolidation settlement at time $t$ to the ultimate settlement. It is also given by the dissipation of average excess pore pressure:\n$$ U(t) = \\frac{s(t)}{s_{\\infty}} = 1 - \\frac{\\bar{u}(t)}{u_0} = 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-M_m^2 T_v\\right) $$\n\n**4. Settlement History $s(t)$**\nThe ultimate primary consolidation settlement, $s_{\\infty}$, is $s_{\\infty} = m_v H \\Delta\\sigma'$. The settlement at time $t$ is $s(t) = U(t) s_{\\infty}$.\n$$ s(t) = s_{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{(2m-1)\\pi}{2}\\right)^2 \\frac{c_v t}{(H/2)^2}\\right)\\right) $$\nThis expression gives the complete settlement history.\n\n**5. Truncation Strategy**\nLet $s_M(t)$ be the settlement calculated by truncating the series after $M$ terms. The most direct interpretation is to truncate the series for $\\bar{u}(t)$:\n$$ \\bar{u}_M(t) = \\frac{8u_0}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v) $$\nThen $U_M(t) = 1 - \\bar{u}_M(t)/u_0$, and $s_M(t) = s_{\\infty} U_M(t)$. The absolute error is:\n$$ |s(t) - s_M(t)| = |s_{\\infty}(U(t) - U_M(t))| = | -s_{\\infty}(\\bar{u}(t) - \\bar{u}_M(t))/u_0 | $$\n$$ |s(t) - s_M(t)| = s_{\\infty} \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=M+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^2} \\exp(-M_m^2 T_v) $$\nTo guarantee that this error is less than a tolerance $\\varepsilon_s$, we bound the tail of the series. The ratio of successive terms in the tail sum is $r_m = \\left(\\frac{2m-1}{2m+1}\\right)^2 \\exp(-2\\pi^2 m T_v)$. For $m \\ge M+1$, this ratio is bounded by $\\rho = r_{M+1}$. The sum of the tail is bounded by a geometric series:\n$$ \\sum_{m=M+1}^{\\infty} \\dots < \\text{(first term)} \\times \\frac{1}{1-\\rho} $$\nThe resulting inequality for selecting the minimal integer $M$ is:\n$$ s_{\\infty} \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\frac{1}{(2M+1)^2} \\exp\\left(-M_{M+1}^2 T_v\\right) \\frac{1}{1-\\rho_M} \\le \\varepsilon_s $$\nwhere $M_{M+1} = \\frac{(2M+1)\\pi}{2}$, $T_v = \\frac{c_v t}{H_d^2}$, and $\\rho_M = \\left(\\frac{2M+1}{2M+3}\\right)^2 \\exp(-2\\pi^2(M+1)T_v)$. This inequality depends on $t, c_v, H,$ and $\\varepsilon_s$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\n**Parameters:**\n- $H = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, so $H_d = H/2 = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- $\\Delta \\sigma' = 150\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 1.5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.\n- $m_v = 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/kN} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/N}$.\n- $c_v = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n- $t^{\\star} = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{years} = 2.00 \\times 365 \\times 24 \\times 3600\\,\\mathrm{s} = 6.3072 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- $\\varepsilon_s = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Ultimate Settlement ($s_{\\infty}$):**\n    $$ s_{\\infty} = m_v H \\Delta\\sigma' = (1.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/N}) \\times (6.0\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) = 0.108\\,\\mathrm{m} = 108\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n2.  **Time Factor ($T_v$):**\n    $$ T_v = \\frac{c_v t^{\\star}}{H_d^2} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\times (6.3072 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s})}{(3.0\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{1.89216}{9.0} = 0.21024 $$\n3.  **Determine minimal number of terms ($M$):**\n    We need to find the smallest integer $M$ satisfying the error inequality.

This final practice exercise demonstrates how to incorporate uncertainty directly into your analysis of consolidation. You will quantify the impact of an ambiguous drainage condition on the time required to reach a target degree of consolidation, moving from a single deterministic prediction to a probabilistic assessment of outcomes [@problem_id:3547318].", "problem": "A saturated, normally consolidated clay layer of thickness $H = 6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ experiences an instantaneous increase in vertical total stress, producing an initially uniform excess pore pressure $u(z,0) = u_0$ across the layer. Consolidation proceeds under one-dimensional conditions with constant material properties, negligible secondary compression, and homogeneous isotropic permeability. The classical one-dimensional theory of consolidation is assumed to hold, based on the linear diffusion of excess pore pressure and the equality of average degree of consolidation to the fraction of ultimate settlement achieved.\n\nThe vertical coefficient of consolidation is known and constant, $c_v = 1.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$. The top boundary is certainly drained. The status of the bottom boundary is ambiguous: with probability $p = 0.6$ the bottom boundary is impervious (single drainage), and with probability $1-p = 0.4$ the bottom boundary is also drained (double drainage). Under single drainage, the maximum drainage path length is $H_d = H$, whereas under double drainage it is $H_d = H/2$.\n\nStarting from the governing diffusion equation for excess pore pressure and its appropriate initial and boundary conditions, determine the predicted time to reach an average degree of consolidation $U = 0.90$ as a function of the maximum drainage path length $H_d$ and the vertical coefficient of consolidation $c_v$.

The governing physics is the diffusion equation, which is standard. The problem is well-posed; it provides a clearly defined probabilistic model for an ambiguous parameter (the drainage condition), which allows for a unique, meaningful solution for the requested statistical quantity (standard deviation). The problem statement is objective, using precise technical language and providing all necessary data ($H$, $c_v$, $p$, $U$) to arrive at a solution. The values are physically realistic for a clay deposit. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is not unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe classical theory of one-dimensional consolidation is governed by the linear diffusion equation for excess pore water pressure $u$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c_v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} $$\nwhere $t$ is time, $z$ is the vertical coordinate, and $c_v$ is the coefficient of consolidation. The solution to this equation, subject to the appropriate initial and boundary conditions, relates the average degree of consolidation, $U$, to a dimensionless Time Factor, $T_v$. The Time Factor is defined as:\n$$ T_v = \\frac{c_v t}{H_d^2} $$\nHere, $H_d$ represents the maximum length of the drainage path. For a given average degree of consolidation $U$, the value of $T_v$ is fixed. For $U > 0.60$, a widely accepted approximation for $T_v$ is:\n$$ T_v \\approx 1.781 - 0.933 \\log_{10}(100(1-U)) $$\nThe problem specifies a target average degree of consolidation $U = 0.90$. We can calculate the corresponding Time Factor:\n$$ T_v(U=0.90) = 1.781 - 0.933 \\log_{10}(100(1-0.90)) = 1.781 - 0.933 \\log_{10}(10) $$\nSince $\\log_{10}(10) = 1$, we have:\n$$ T_v = 1.781 - 0.933 = 0.848 $$\nFrom the definition of the Time Factor, we can express the time $t$ required to reach a certain degree of consolidation as a function of $T_v$, $c_v$, and $H_d$:\n$$ t(H_d) = \\frac{T_v H_d^2}{c_v} $$\nThis equation fulfills the first part of the task. Since $T_v$ and $c_v$ are constants for this problem, $t$ is directly proportional to the square of the maximum drainage path length, $H_d^2$.\n\nThe maximum drainage path length $H_d$ is a discrete random variable dependent on the ambiguous bottom boundary condition.\n-   **Case 1: Single Drainage.** The bottom boundary is impervious. The maximum drainage path is the full thickness of the layer, $H_d = H$. This occurs with probability $p = 0.6$. The time to reach $U=0.90$ in this case, denoted $t_1$, is:\n    $$ t_1 = \\frac{T_v H^2}{c_v} $$\n-   **Case 2: Double Drainage.** The bottom boundary is pervious. The maximum drainage path is half the layer thickness, $H_d = H/2$. This occurs with probability $1-p = 0.4$. The time to reach $U=0.90$ in this case, denoted $t_2$, is:\n    $$ t_2 = \\frac{T_v (H/2)^2}{c_v} = \\frac{T_v H^2}{4c_v} $$\n\nWe are asked to find the standard deviation of the predicted time, $\\sigma_t$. The time $t$ is a discrete random variable that can take two values, $t_1$ and $t_2$, with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively. The variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\sigma_t^2$, is given by $\\mathrm{Var}(t) = E[t^2] - (E[t])^2$.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected value (mean) of the time, $E[t]$:\n$$ E[t] = t_1 \\cdot p + t_2 \\cdot (1-p) = \\left(\\frac{T_v H^2}{c_v}\\right) p + \\left(\\frac{T_v H^2}{4c_v}\\right) (1-p) $$\nLet's define a constant $K = \\frac{T_v H^2}{c_v}$ to simplify the notation.\n$$ E[t] = Kp + \\frac{K}{4}(1-p) = K \\left(p + \\frac{1-p}{4}\\right) = K \\left(\\frac{3p+1}{4}\\right) $$\nNext, we compute the expected value of the square of the time, $E[t^2]$:\n$$ E[t^2] = t_1^2 \\cdot p + t_2^2 \\cdot (1-p) = K^2 p + \\left(\\frac{K}{4}\\right)^2 (1-p) = K^2 \\left(p + \\frac{1-p}{16}\\right) = K^2 \\left(\\frac{15p+1}{16}\\right) $$\nNow, we can find the variance:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(t) = E[t^2] - (E[t])^2 = K^2 \\left(\\frac{15p+1}{16}\\right) - \\left[K \\left(\\frac{3p+1}{4}\\right)\\right]^2 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(t) = K^2 \\left[ \\frac{15p+1}{16} - \\frac{(3p+1)^2}{16} \\right] = \\frac{K^2}{16} [ (15p+1) - (9p^2+6p+1) ] $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(t) = \\frac{K^2}{16} [ 15p+1 - 9p^2-6p-1 ] = \\frac{K^2}{16} [ 9p - 9p^2 ] = \\frac{9K^2 p(1-p)}{16} $$\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma_t$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{9K^2 p(1-p)}{16}} = \\frac{3K\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{4} $$\nSubstituting back $K = \\frac{T_v H^2}{c_v}$:\n$$ \\sigma_t = \\frac{3}{4} \\left(\\frac{T_v H^2}{c_v}\\right) \\sqrt{p(1-p)} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $H = 6\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $c_v = 1.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $p = 0.6$, and the calculated $T_v = 0.848$.\nFirst, calculate the term in parentheses, which is the time $t_1$:\n$$ \\frac{T_v H^2}{c_v} = \\frac{0.848 \\times (6\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{0.848 \\times 36}{1.2 \\times 10^{-7}}\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{30.528}{1.2 \\times 10^{-7}}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 2.544 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nNow we calculate the full expression for $\\sigma_t$ in seconds:\n$$ \\sigma_t = \\frac{3}{4} (2.544 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\sqrt{0.6(1-0.6)} = \\frac{3}{4} (2.544 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\sqrt{0.24} $$\n$$ \\sigma_t \\approx (1.908 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times 0.4898979... \\approx 9.347855 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in days.
