The bulk volume is assumed to remain constant during this chemical process, so $\\dot{V}_b^r = 0$. The resulting rate of porosity change is:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\phi}_{\\text{react}} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_p^r}{V_b} - \\phi \\frac{\\dot{V}_b^r}{V_b} = \\frac{-\\dot{V}_s^r}{V_b} - 0 = \\frac{\\dot{m}_s^r}{\\rho_s}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Total Rate of Porosity Change**: The total rate of change of porosity is the sum of the rates from the two independent processes:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\phi} = \\dot{\\phi}_{\\text{deform}} + \\dot{\\phi}_{\\text{react}} = (1-\\phi)\\dot{\\varepsilon}_v^p + \\frac{\\dot{m}_s^r}{\\rho_s}\n    $$\n    This is the final expression for the rate of change of porosity.\n\n### Task 2: Derivation of the Bulk Density Rate ($\\dot{\\rho}$)\n\nThe bulk mass density, $\\rho$, is given by the mixture rule:\n$$\n\\rho = (1-\\phi)\\rho_s + \\phi \\rho_f\n$$\nWe are asked to derive its time rate of change, $\\dot{\\rho}$, in two equivalent forms, assuming the fluid is incompressible ($\\dot{\\rho}_f = 0$).\n\n**Decomposition 1: Term-by-Term Product Rule**\n\nWe treat the bulk density as a sum of two products, $\\rho = [(1-\\phi)\\rho_s] + [\\phi\\rho_f]$, and apply the product rule for differentiation to each term:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho} = \\frac{d}{dt}[(1-\\phi)\\rho_s] + \\frac{d}{dt}[\\phi\\rho_f]\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho} = \\left[\\frac{d(1-\\phi)}{dt}\\rho_s + (1-\\phi)\\frac{d\\rho_s}{dt}\\right] + \\left[\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\\rho_f + \\phi\\frac{d\\rho_f}{dt}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the rate notation and the assumption $\\dot{\\rho}_f = 0$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_1 = [-\\dot{\\phi}\\rho_s + (1-\\phi)\\dot{\\rho}_s] + [\\dot{\\phi}\\rho_f + \\phi \\cdot 0]\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_1 = -\\dot{\\phi}\\rho_s + (1-\\phi)\\dot{\\rho}_s + \\dot{\\phi}\\rho_f\n$$\n\n**Decomposition 2: Multivariate Chain Rule**\n\nWe treat the bulk density $\\rho$ as a function of the time-dependent variables $\\phi$, $\\rho_s$, and $\\rho_f$, i.e., $\\rho(\\phi, \\rho_s, \\rho_f)$. The total time derivative is given by the multivariate chain rule:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho} = \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\phi}\\dot{\\phi} + \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\rho_s}\\dot{\\rho}_s + \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\rho_f}\\dot{\\rho}_f\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives from the definition of $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}((1-\\phi)\\rho_s + \\phi\\rho_f) = -\\rho_s + \\rho_f = -(\\rho_s - \\rho_f)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\rho_s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho_s}((1-\\phi)\\rho_s + \\phi\\rho_f) = 1-\\phi\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\rho_f} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho_f}((1-\\phi)\\rho_s + \\phi\\rho_f) = \\phi\n$$\nSubstituting these partial derivatives into the chain rule expression and applying the condition $\\dot{\\rho}_f=0$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_2 = -(\\rho_s - \\rho_f)\\dot{\\phi} + (1-\\phi)\\dot{\\rho}_s + \\phi \\cdot 0\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_2 = (\\rho_f - \\rho_s)\\dot{\\phi} + (1-\\phi)\\dot{\\rho}_s\n$$\n\n**Equivalence of Decompositions**\n\nTo show that the two decompositions are identical, we rearrange the terms of $\\dot{\\rho}_1$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_1 = -\\dot{\\phi}\\rho_s + (1-\\phi)\\dot{\\rho}_s + \\dot{\\phi}\\rho_f = \\dot{\\phi}(\\rho_f - \\rho_s) + (1-\\phi)\\dot{\\rho}_s\n$$\nThis is precisely the expression for $\\dot{\\rho}_2$. Thus, $\\dot{\\rho}_1 \\equiv \\dot{\\rho}_2$, demonstrating their mathematical equivalence for any admissible set of parameters.\n\n### Task 3: Algorithmic Implementation\n\nThe provided Python code will implement these derived formulas for the given test cases. For each case, the algorithm will:\n1.  Compute the porosity rate $\\dot{\\phi}$ using the expression derived in Task 1.\n2.  Compute the bulk density rate using both Decomposition 1 ($\\dot{\\rho}_1$) and Decomposition 2 ($\\dot{\\rho}_2$) as derived in Task 2.\n3.  Evaluate the boolean condition $|\\dot{\\rho}_1 - \\dot{\\rho}_2| \\le \\tau$, where the tolerance $\\tau$ is $10^{-12}$.\n4.
