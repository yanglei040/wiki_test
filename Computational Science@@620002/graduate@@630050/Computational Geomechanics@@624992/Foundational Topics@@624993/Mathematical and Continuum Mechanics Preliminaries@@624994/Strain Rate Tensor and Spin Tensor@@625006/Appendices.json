However, its spatial derivatives—the velocity gradient, strain rate, and spin—are not. For a linear element, these quantities are constant within each element but exhibit jumps across element boundaries. This represents a piecewise-constant approximation of the true, generally smooth, gradient field. This low-order approximation is a primary source of discretization error in simulations.\n\nThis element is known to perform poorly in bending-dominated problems and can exhibit \"locking\" phenomena. The accuracy of the solution generally improves with mesh refinement (h-refinement, using smaller elements) or by using higher-order elements (p-refinement) which allow for non-constant gradients within the element.\n\nThe discrete gradient, as computed here, is exact under one specific condition: if the true underlying velocity field is a linear function of the spatial coordinates within the domain spanned by the element. A linear velocity field can be written as $\\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{A} \\boldsymbol{x} + \\boldsymbol{b}$, where $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is a constant matrix and $\\boldsymbol{b}$ is a constant vector. The velocity gradient of such a field is $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{A}$, which is constant. A linear finite element can exactly represent a linear field. If the nodal velocities provided are exact samples from such a linear field, the finite element interpolation will reproduce the field exactly, and the computed constant velocity gradient will be the exact gradient everywhere in the element. For any velocity field that is of higher order (e.g., quadratic), the linear element's constant gradient is only an approximation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.05000  -0.1500 \\\\ 0.02500  0.2000 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3564019"}, {"introduction": "Constitutive laws must describe intrinsic material behavior, independent of the observer's motion—a principle known as frame indifference or objectivity.

Its gradient is simply the tensor $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T$.\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}'}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}(t)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t)\\mathbf{x}') = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}(t)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t)\n$$\nFor the second term, we apply the chain rule. In direct notation, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}'}(\\boldsymbol{Q}\\mathbf{v}(\\boldsymbol{Q}^T\\mathbf{x}')) = \\boldsymbol{Q}(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\mathbf{v})\\boldsymbol{Q}^T = \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T$.\n\nCombining the gradients of both terms, we obtain the transformation law for the velocity gradient:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{L}'(t, \\mathbf{x}') = \\boldsymbol{Q}(t)\\boldsymbol{L}(t, \\mathbf{x})\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t) + \\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}(t)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Transformed $D'$, $W'$, and the Non-Objective Contribution**\n\nLet us define the tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}(t)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t)$, which represents the spin (or angular velocity tensor) of the rotating frame. By differentiating the orthogonality condition $\\boldsymbol{Q}(t)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t) = \\boldsymbol{I}$, we get $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}^T = \\boldsymbol{0}$. Since $(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T)^T = (\\boldsymbol{Q}^T)^T\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}^T = \\boldsymbol{Q}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}^T$, this condition can be written as $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T = \\boldsymbol{0}$, which proves that $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ is a skew-symmetric tensor.\n\nThe expression for $\\boldsymbol{L}'$ is $\\boldsymbol{L}' = \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$.\n\nThe rate-of-deformation tensor in the rotating frame is $\\boldsymbol{D}' = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L}' + \\boldsymbol{L}'^T)$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{D}' = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (\\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) + (\\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega})^T \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}^T\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T \\right)\n$$\nUsing $\\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L}+\\boldsymbol{L}^T)$ and the fact that $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ is skew-symmetric ($\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T = -\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$), we get:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{D}' = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{Q}(\\boldsymbol{L}+\\boldsymbol{L}^T)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T) = \\boldsymbol{Q} \\boldsymbol{D} \\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{0} = \\boldsymbol{Q} \\boldsymbol{D} \\boldsymbol{Q}^T\n$$\nThe tensor $\\boldsymbol{D}$ transforms objectively.\n\nThe spin tensor in the rotating frame is $\\boldsymbol{W}' = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L}' - \\boldsymbol{L}'^T)$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{W}' = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (\\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) - (\\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega})^T \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} - \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{L}^T\\boldsymbol{Q}^T - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T \\right)\n$$\nUsing $\\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L}-\\boldsymbol{L}^T)$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T = -\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$, we get:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{W}' = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{Q}(\\boldsymbol{L}-\\boldsymbol{L}^T)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T) = \\boldsymbol{Q} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} - (-\\boldsymbol{\\Omega})) = \\boldsymbol{Q} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{Q}^T + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\n$$\nThe transformation for $\\boldsymbol{W}'$ contains an additive term $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}\\boldsymbol{Q}^T$ which is not present in the standard tensor transformation law. This term depends solely on the motion of the observer's frame and not on the material's deformation. Therefore, $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}(t)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t)$ is the **non-objective contribution** due to the rotation of the frame. Its presence makes the spin tensor $\\boldsymbol{W}$ a non-objective quantity. It is important to note that this contribution is independent of the specific flow, characterized by $\\boldsymbol{L}_0$.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of the Frobenius Norm**\n\nWe must evaluate the Frobenius norm of the non-objective contribution $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t)$ at $t = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe rotation is about the $z$-axis with angle $\\theta(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{Q}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta(t)  -\\sin\\theta(t)  0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta(t)  \\cos\\theta(t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIts transpose is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta(t)  \\sin\\theta(t)  0 \\\\ -\\sin\\theta(t)  \\cos\\theta(t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe angular rate is $\\dot{\\theta}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t^2\\right) = t$. The units of the coefficient $\\frac{1}{2}$ are $\\mathrm{rad}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, so $\\dot{\\theta}(t)$ has units of $\\mathrm{rad}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe time derivative of $\\boldsymbol{Q}(t)$ is found using the chain rule: $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}(t) = \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{Q}}{d\\theta}\\dot{\\theta}(t)$.\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}(t) = \\dot{\\theta}(t) \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\theta(t)  -\\cos\\theta(t)  0 \\\\ \\cos\\theta(t)  -\\sin\\theta(t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = t \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\theta(t)  -\\cos\\theta(t)  0 \\\\ \\cos\\theta(t)  -\\sin\\theta(t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{Q}}(t)\\boldsymbol{Q}^T(t)$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t) = t \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\theta  -\\cos\\theta  0 \\\\ \\cos\\theta  -\\sin\\theta  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  \\sin\\theta  0 \\\\ -\\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t) = t \\begin{pmatrix} (-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta + \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta)  (-\\sin^2\\theta - \\cos^2\\theta)  0 \\\\ (\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta)  (\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta)  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t) = t \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  0 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -t  0 \\\\ t  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Frobenius norm of $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t)$ is defined as $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t)\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T(t)\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t))}$.\nFirst, calculate $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T(t)\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  t  0 \\\\ -t  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -t  0 \\\\ t  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} t^2  0  0 \\\\ 0  t^2  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^T\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) = t^2 + t^2 + 0 = 2t^2$.\nThe Frobenius norm is therefore:\n$$\n\\|\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(t)\\|_F = \\sqrt{2t^2} = |t|\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nWe need to evaluate this at time $t = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$.
