No rounding is necessary and no physical units are required.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in tensor algebra and continuum mechanics, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, a derivation of the principal invariants $I_{1}$, $I_{2}$, and $I_{3}$ of a symmetric second-order tensor $T$ in terms of its trace, determinant, and the trace of its square; second, a computation of these invariants for a specific tensor.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Invariants\n\nWe are given the characteristic polynomial of a second-order tensor $T$ in a $3$-dimensional space:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = \\det(\\lambda I - T) = \\lambda^{3} - I_{1}\\lambda^{2} + I_{2}\\lambda - I_{3}\n$$\nThe roots of this polynomial, $\\lambda_{1}$, $\\lambda_{2}$, and $\\lambda_{3}$, are the eigenvalues of $T$. The characteristic polynomial can therefore be written in its factored form:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (\\lambda - \\lambda_{1})(\\lambda - \\lambda_{2})(\\lambda - \\lambda_{3})\n$$\nExpanding this factored form yields:\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (\\lambda^{2} - (\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})\\lambda + \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2})(\\lambda - \\lambda_{3})\n$$\n$$\np(\\lambda) = \\lambda^{3} - \\lambda_{3}\\lambda^{2} - (\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})\\lambda^{2} + (\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})\\lambda_{3}\\lambda + \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda - \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3}\n$$\n$$\np(\\lambda) = \\lambda^{3} - (\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} + \\lambda_{3})\\lambda^{2} + (\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2} + \\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3} + \\lambda_{3}\\lambda_{1})\\lambda - \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3}\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of this expanded polynomial with the given definition, we identify the principal invariants in terms of the eigenvalues:\n$$\nI_{1} = \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} + \\lambda_{3}\n$$\n$$\nI_{2} = \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2} + \\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3} + \\lambda_{3}\\lambda_{1}\n$$\n$$\nI_{3} = \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3}\n$$\nThe next step is to relate these expressions to the specified tensor operations. The tensor $T$ is stated to be symmetric, which guarantees that it has real eigenvalues and an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors $\\{n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}\\}$. This allows for the spectral representation of $T$:\n$$\nT = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i} (n_{i} \\otimes n_{i})\n$$\nwhere $\\otimes$ denotes the dyadic product.\n\n**Derivation of $I_{1}$:**\nThe first invariant, $I_{1}$, is the sum of the eigenvalues. This is, by definition, the trace of the tensor $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{tr}(T)$. We can demonstrate this using the spectral representation and properties of the trace operator. The trace is a linear operator, so:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(T) = \\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i} (n_{i} \\otimes n_{i})\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i} \\operatorname{tr}(n_{i} \\otimes n_{i})\n$$\nThe trace of a dyadic product $u \\otimes v$ is their scalar product, $\\operatorname{tr}(u \\otimes v) = u \\cdot v$. Since the eigenvectors $\\{n_{i}\\}$ form an orthonormal basis, $n_{i} \\cdot n_{i} = \\|n_{i}\\|^{2} = 1$. Thus, $\\operatorname{tr}(n_{i} \\otimes n_{i}) = 1$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(T) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i} (1) = \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} + \\lambda_{3}\n$$\nTherefore, the first invariant is the trace of the tensor:\n$$\nI_{1} = \\operatorname{tr}(T)\n$$\n\n**Derivation of $I_{3}$:**\nThe third invariant, $I_{3}$, is the product of the eigenvalues. This is a fundamental property of the determinant of a tensor.\n$$\nI_{3} = \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3} = \\det(T)\n$$\n\n**Derivation of $I_{2}$:**\nThe derivation for the second invariant, $I_{2}$, requires more algebraic manipulation. We start by considering the square of the first invariant:\n$$\nI_{1}^{2} = (\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} + \\lambda_{3})^{2} = \\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2} + 2(\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2} + \\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3} + \\lambda_{3}\\lambda_{1})\n$$\nRecognizing the expressions for $I_{2}$ and the sum of squared eigenvalues, we can write:\n$$\nI_{1}^{2} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i}^{2}\\right) + 2I_{2}\n$$\nRearranging for $I_{2}$:\n$$\nI_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ I_{1}^{2} - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i}^{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\operatorname{tr}(T))^{2} - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i}^{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nNow we must relate the sum of squared eigenvalues, $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i}^{2}$, to a tensor operation. Let's consider the tensor $T^{2} = T \\cdot T$. The eigenvalues of $T^{2}$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $T$, i.e., $\\lambda_{1}^{2}, \\lambda_{2}^{2}, \\lambda_{3}^{2}$. Consequently, the trace of $T^{2}$ is the sum of its eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(T^{2}) = \\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2}\n$$\nThis can be shown more formally using the Frobenius inner product ($A:B = \\operatorname{tr}(A^{T}B)$), as requested. For the symmetric tensor $T$, $\\operatorname{tr}(T^{2}) = \\operatorname{tr}(T^{T}T) = T:T$. The Frobenius inner product is invariant under an orthonormal change of basis. In the principal basis of eigenvectors $\\{n_i\\}$, the tensor $T$ is represented by a diagonal matrix with entries $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$. The Frobenius inner product in this basis is simply the sum of squares of the diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(T^{2}) = T:T = \\lambda_{1}^{2} + \\lambda_{2}^{2} + \\lambda_{3}^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $I_{2}$:\n$$\nI_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} [(\\operatorname{tr}(T))^{2} - \\operatorname{tr}(T^{2})]\n$$\nThe derivations are now complete.\n\n### Part 2: Computation for the specific tensor\n\nWe are given the tensor:\n$$\nT=\\begin{bmatrix}3&-1&0\\\\-1&2&1\\\\0&1&1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the invariants using the derived formulas.\n\n**Compute $I_{1}$:**\nThe first invariant is the trace of $T$.\n$$\nI_{1} = \\operatorname{tr}(T) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6\n$$\n\n**Compute $I_{3}$:**\nThe third invariant is the determinant of $T$.\n$$\nI_{3} = \\det(T) = 3\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1)\\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} + 0\\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nI_{3} = 3(2 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 1) + 1(-1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 1) + 0 = 3(1) + 1(-1) = 3 - 1 = 2\n$$\n\n**Compute $I_{2}$:**\nTo compute $I_{2}$, we first need to find $T^{2}$ and its trace.\n$$\nT^{2} = T \\cdot T = \\begin{bmatrix}3&-1&0\\\\-1&2&1\\\\0&1&1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}3&-1&0\\\\-1&2&1\\\\0&1&1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nT^{2} = \\begin{bmatrix} (3)(3)+(-1)(-1)+(0)(0) & (3)(-1)+(-1)(2)+(0)(1) & (3)(0)+(-1)(1)+(0)(1) \\\\ (-1)(3)+(2)(-1)+(1)(0) & (-1)(-1)+(2)(2)+(1)(1) & (-1)(0)+(2)(1)+(1)(1) \\\\ (0)(3)+(1)(-1)+(1)(0) & (0)(-1)+(1)(2)+(1)(1) & (0)(0)+(1)(1)+(1)(1) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nT^{2} = \\begin{bmatrix} 9+1 & -3-2 & -1 \\\\ -3-2 & 1+4+1 & 2+1 \\\\ -1 & 2+1 & 1+1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 10 & -5 & -1 \\\\ -5 & 6 & 3 \\\\ -1 & 3 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace of $T^{2}$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(T^{2}) = 10 + 6 + 2 = 18\n$$\nNow we can compute $I_{2}$:\n$$\nI_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} [(\\operatorname{tr}(T))^{2} - \\operatorname{tr}(T^{2})] = \\frac{1}{2} [6^{2} - 18] = \\frac{1}{2} [36 - 18] = \\frac{1}{2} [18] = 9\n$$\nThe principal invariants are $I_{1}=6$, $I_{2}=9$, and $I_{3}=2$.\n\nThe final result is the triplet $(I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 9 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3567001"}, {"introduction": "In geomechanics, it is crucial to separate the stress that causes volume change from the stress that causes shape change (distortion).

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of two stress invariants, the mean (hydrostatic) stress $p$ and the von Mises equivalent stress $q$, for a given Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.
