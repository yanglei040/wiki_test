Its components describe the predominant orientation of contacts. An isotropic material, with no preferential contact orientation, would have $F_{ij} = \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}$. The computed tensor is clearly anisotropic since $F_{11} > F_{22} > F_{33}$.\nThe principal directions of $F_{ij}$ (its eigenvectors) are the axes along which the geometric structure is extremal. The corresponding eigenvalues represent the statistical weight of contacts oriented along these principal directions. In this problem, the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\lambda_1$ corresponds to the $x_1$-direction, indicating this is the direction of strongest geometric fabric. This is consistent with the input data, where the contacts aligned with the $x_1$-direction have the largest total branch length weighting.\nThe anisotropy index $a$ is a scalar measure that condenses the degree of fabric anisotropy into a single number, ranging from $0$ for an isotropic fabric ($\\lambda_{\\max} = \\lambda_{\\min}$) to $1$ for a purely one-dimensional fabric (e.g., all contacts aligned in one direction). The calculated value $a \\approx 0.2778$ signifies a moderate degree of structural anisotropy.\nThe use of periodic boundary conditions is critical for ensuring that the small RVE is statistically representative of a larger (theoretically infinite) granular medium, by eliminating confounding surface effects. The branch vectors are defined using the minimum image convention, which correctly captures the nearest-neighbor distances in this periodic space. Weighting by branch length $|\\boldsymbol{\\ell}^{(c)}|$ emphasizes the contribution of contacts that span larger distances, thus providing a measure sensitive to the overall spatial arrangement and not just the number of contacts in a given orientation. This specific choice of weighting makes the fabric tensor a descriptor of the structural skeleton of the granular packing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2778}$$", "id": "3507288"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of any Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation lies the contact law, which governs the forces that arise when particles interact.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to find the updated elastic rolling angle, $\\Delta \\theta_r$, at the end of the time step. The problem describes a standard elastoplastic contact law with a return-mapping algorithm for both sliding and rolling. The initial state of the contact is defined by zero stored elastic tangential displacement and zero stored elastic rolling angle. The key assumption is that the tangential (sliding) and rotational (rolling) responses are uncoupled and can be solved independently. We therefore focus exclusively on the rotational component, as requested.\n\nThe procedure for the rotational update is as follows:\n1.  Compute a trial rolling resistance moment, $M_r^{\\text{trial}}$, assuming a purely elastic response to the predicted kinematic increment.\n2.  Define the yield surface, which represents the maximum allowable rolling moment, $M_{r, \\text{limit}}$.\n3.  Check if the trial moment exceeds the yield limit.\n4.  If the trial moment is within the yield limit, the response is elastic, and the final state is the trial state. If it exceeds the limit, a plastic correction (return mapping) is applied, where the moment is returned to the yield surface, and the final elastic rolling angle is updated accordingly.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the Trial Rolling Moment**\nThe contact starts with zero stored elastic rolling angle. The trial moment is calculated based on the predicted relative rolling angle increment, $\\Delta \\theta_r^{\\text{trial}}$, using the linear elastic law for the torsional spring:\n$$M_r^{\\text{trial}} = k_r \\Delta \\theta_r^{\\text{trial}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$M_r^{\\text{trial}} = (10 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m/rad}) \\times (0.08 \\, \\text{rad}) = 0.8 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$$\n\n**Step 2: Define the Rolling Resistance Yield Limit**\nThe yield condition for rolling resistance is given by $|M_r| \\le \\mu_r F_n R$. The magnitude of the limit moment, $M_{r, \\text{limit}}$, is:\n$$M_{r, \\text{limit}} = \\mu_r F_n R$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$M_{r, \\text{limit}} = (0.05) \\times (50 \\, \\text{N}) \\times (0.02 \\, \\text{m}) = 0.05 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$$\n\n**Step 3: Check the Yield Condition**\nWe compare the magnitude of the trial moment with the yield limit:\n$$|M_r^{\\text{trial}}| = |0.8 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}| = 0.8 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$$\nSince $0.8 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m} > 0.05 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$, the condition $|M_r^{\\text{trial}}| > M_{r, \\text{limit}}$ is met. This indicates that the rolling resistance limit has been exceeded, and a plastic adjustment is required.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Return-Mapping Algorithm**\nThe return-mapping algorithm projects the trial state back onto the yield surface. The final rolling moment, $M_r$, will have a magnitude equal to the yield limit and the same direction (sign) as the trial moment. Since $\\Delta \\theta_r^{\\text{trial}}$ is positive, $M_r^{\\text{trial}}$ is positive, so the final moment $M_r$ is also positive.\n$$M_r = M_{r, \\text{limit}} = 0.05 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$$\nThe updated elastic rolling angle, $\\Delta \\theta_r$, is the angle that is consistent with this final moment according to the elastic relationship $M_r = k_r \\Delta \\theta_r$. We solve for $\\Delta \\theta_r$:\n$$\\Delta \\theta_r = \\frac{M_r}{k_r}$$\nSubstituting the values for the final moment and the rolling stiffness:\n$$\\Delta \\theta_r = \\frac{0.05 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}}{10 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m/rad}} = 0.005 \\, \\text{rad}$$\n\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.005$ can be written as $0.00500$ to express this precision.\n\nThus, the updated elastic rolling angle stored at the contact after the step is $0.00500$ radians. The difference between the trial angle increment ($\\Delta \\theta_r^{\\text{trial}} = 0.08$ rad) and the final stored elastic angle ($\\Delta \\theta_r = 0.00500$ rad) represents the plastic rolling slip that occurred during the time step.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00500}$$", "id": "3507293"}, {"introduction": "A predictive micromechanical model is only as good as its calibrated parameters.

It is **valid**. The solution will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem revolves around the interpretation of the sensitivity matrix $S$. The entry $S_{ij} = \\partial \\ln y_i / \\partial \\ln \\theta_j$ quantifies the local, relative sensitivity of the $i$-th output to the $j$-th parameter. A small, fractional change in parameter $\\theta_j$ by a factor $(1+\\epsilon)$ leads to a fractional change in output $y_i$ by a factor $(1+S_{ij}\\epsilon)$, to first order. For a vector of small logarithmic changes in parameters, $\\delta \\ln \\theta$, the corresponding change in logarithmic outputs is given by $\\delta \\ln y = S \\, \\delta \\ln \\theta$.\n\nLet's analyze the given matrix:\n$$\nS =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nS_{y_1,k_n} & S_{y_1,k_t} & S_{y_1,\\mu} & S_{y_1,e} \\\\\nS_{y_2,k_n} & S_{y_2,k_t} & S_{y_2,\\mu} & S_{y_2,e} \\\\\nS_{y_3,k_n} & S_{y_3,k_t} & S_{y_3,\\mu} & S_{y_3,e} \\\\\nS_{y_4,k_n} & S_{y_4,k_t} & S_{y_4,\\mu} & S_{y_4,e}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.80 & 0.395 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\\\\n0.40 & 0.197 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\\\\n0.10 & 0.049 & 1.10 & 0.00 \\\\\n-0.20 & -0.098 & 0.75 & 0.00\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nTwo key features are immediately apparent:\n1.  The fourth column, corresponding to the sensitivity with respect to the coefficient of restitution $e$, is a zero vector.\n2.  The first and second columns, corresponding to sensitivities with respect to $k_n$ and $k_t$, are nearly linearly dependent. Let $C_1$ be column $1$ and $C_2$ be column $2$. We can observe that $0.395/0.80 \\approx 0.494$, $0.197/0.40 \\approx 0.493$, $0.049/0.10 = 0.490$, and $-0.098/(-0.20) = 0.490$. Thus, $C_2 \\approx 0.49 C_1$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the given quasi-static tests, the normal coefficient of restitution $e$ is structurally unidentifiable because the outputs are independent of $e$; this can be detected by a zero column in the sensitivity matrix and a rank deficiency with respect to $e$.**\n\nThe fourth column of $S$ is $\\partial \\ln y / \\partial \\ln e = [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00]^T$. This means that, at least locally, a change in $e$ produces no change in any of the outputs $y_i$. This aligns with the physical context: $e$ governs energy loss during dynamic impacts, which are negligible in a quasi-static test. According to the definition of structural identifiability, if different parameter values (e.g., different values of $e$) produce identical outputs, the parameter is structurally unidentifiable. The zero column is a definitive indicator of this condition. A zero column also implies that the columns of the matrix are linearly dependent, meaning the matrix does not have full column rank (its rank is at most $3$ in a $4 \\times 4$ matrix), which is a formal condition for lack of identifiability. The statement is entirely correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The columns of $S$ associated with $k_n$ and $k_t$ are nearly proportional, implying a severe practical identifiability issue for disentangling $k_n$ and $k_t$ from these data; this can be detected by inspecting the singular values or condition number of $S$ (or of the Fisher Information Matrix), and mitigated by adding an experiment that excites tangential stiffness separately (for example, small-amplitude cyclic shear or shear wave speed measurements).**\n\nAs noted in the initial analysis, the first two columns are nearly proportional: $C_2 \\approx 0.49 C_1$. This condition, known as multicollinearity, means the effects of changing $k_n$ and $k_t$ are highly correlated across the measured outputs. While they may not be perfectly dependent (allowing for theoretical structural identifiability), any measurement noise will make it practically impossible to distinguish their individual contributions. This is a classic practical identifiability problem. Mathematically, this near-linear dependence results in the matrix $S$ being ill-conditioned, which is characterized by a high condition number (a large ratio between the largest and smallest singular values). The Fisher Information Matrix, which in a linear regression context is proportional to $S^T S$, would also be ill-conditioned, leading to large variances in the estimated parameters. The proposed mitigation—adding an experiment like shear wave speed measurement—is appropriate. The speed of shear waves is strongly dependent on the tangential stiffness $k_t$ and less on $k_n$, which would introduce a new output (a new row in $S$) for which the sensitivities to $k_n$ and $k_t$ are not proportional, thus breaking the collinearity and resolving the practical identifiability issue.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. If a high-velocity impact or resonant column test that is explicitly sensitive to collisional damping is added to the experiment design, then $e$ can become structurally identifiable because the output-to-parameter mapping gains explicit dependence on $e$.**\n\nThis statement addresses the structural unidentifiability of $e$ identified in option A. The root cause of the unidentifiability is that the chosen experiments (quasi-static tests) are physically insensitive to the parameter $e$. The proposed solution is to add experiments (high-velocity impact, resonant column test) that are dynamic in nature. In such tests, macroscopic observables like energy dissipation, wave attenuation, or damping ratios are directly influenced by the energy loss at inter-particle contacts during collisions, a process governed by $e$. Adding such an observable would create a new output-to-parameter mapping where the sensitivity of this new output to $e$ is non-zero. This adds a non-zero element to the column for $e$ in the (now expanded) sensitivity matrix, making a change in $e$ detectable. This resolves the structural unidentifiability.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Because there are four outputs and four parameters, all parameters are structurally identifiable under the given tests regardless of the sensitivity structure.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. Structural identifiability requires that the mapping from parameters to outputs be injective (one-to-one). In the context of local, linear analysis, this requires the sensitivity matrix $S$ to have full column rank. The number of parameters being equal to the number of outputs ($n=m=4$) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the matrix to be invertible (and thus have full rank). The structure of the mapping, encapsulated in $S$, is what determines identifiability. In this case, we have already established that the rank of $S$ is less than $4$ because the fourth column is zero. Therefore, not all parameters are structurally identifiable.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. One way to detect unidentifiable parameter combinations is to search for nonzero vectors $\\delta \\ln \\theta$ such that $S \\,\\delta \\ln \\theta \\approx 0$, indicating directions in parameter space (for example, simultaneous scalings of $k_n$ and $k_t$ that preserve $k_t/k_n$) along which the outputs remain invariant to first order.**\n\nThis statement describes the mathematical basis for identifiability analysis. An unidentifiable parameter or combination of parameters implies that one can move in the parameter space without affecting the model output. In a linearized framework, this corresponds to finding a non-zero vector of parameter changes, $\\delta \\ln \\theta$, that lies in the null space of the sensitivity matrix $S$, such that the output change $\\delta \\ln y = S \\, \\delta \\ln \\theta \\approx 0$. This principle is fundamentally correct. For the given matrix, the near-dependency $C_1 - (1/0.49) C_2 \\approx 0$ does not correspond to a simple scaling that preserves $k_t/k_n$. A change that preserves $k_t/k_n$ implies $\\delta \\ln k_t = \\delta \\ln k_n$, corresponding to a vector $\\delta \\ln \\theta \\propto [1, 1, 0, 0]^T$. For this case, $S \\delta \\ln \\theta \\propto C_1 + C_2 \\neq 0$. However, the statement presents \"preserving $k_t/k_n$\" as an *example* of a direction of invariance. While this specific example does not apply to the given numerical matrix, it is a plausible form of unidentifiability in other granular mechanics contexts. The core of the statement is the description of the method ($S \\delta \\ln \\theta \\approx 0$) and its interpretation, which are perfectly correct. The statement is about a general method for detection, and the principle it describes is sound.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "3507308"}]}
