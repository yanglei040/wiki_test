Geomaterials, such as soils and rocks, are multi-phase media with a solid-grain-skeleton and a network of interconnected pores filled with fluids (e.g., water, air). The Jacobian $J$ quantifies the total volume change of a material element.\nA value of $J=1$ signifies an isochoric (volume-preserving) deformation.\nA value of $J  1$ signifies volumetric expansion, or dilation.\nA value of $J  1$ signifies volumetric contraction, or compaction.\n\nIn geomaterials, this volume change results in a change in the volume of the pores, i.e., a change in porosity, assuming the solid grains are incompressible.\nIf $J \\neq 1$, the material is undergoing a non-isochoric deformation.\n- **Dilation ($J1$)**: Corresponds to an increase in pore volume and thus an increase in porosity. This phenomenon is characteristic of dense sands or over-consolidated clays when sheared, where grains must roll over each other, increasing the void space.\n- **Compaction ($J1$)**: Corresponds to a decrease in pore volume and a decrease in porosity. This is typical for loose soils, which densify under compression or shear as grains rearrange into a more compact packing.\n\nThe distinction between drained and undrained conditions is critical:\n- **Drained Conditions**: The pore fluid is free to flow out of (during compaction) or into (during dilation) the material element. Therefore, volume changes are permitted, and it is common to have $J \\neq 1$. The load is primarily supported by the solid skeleton (effective stress).\n- **Undrained Conditions**: The pore fluid is trapped within the material element, for instance, due to rapid loading or low permeability. If the pore fluid (e.g., water) and the solid grains are assumed to be incompressible, the total volume of the material element cannot change. This imposes the kinematic constraint $J = 1$. Any tendency of the solid skeleton to change volume is counteracted by a change in pore fluid pressure. A tendency to compact increases pore pressure, while a tendency to dilate decreases it. Therefore, for saturated, incompressible geomaterials under undrained conditions, deformation is modeled as isochoric, meaning $J=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\lambda_{2}  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\lambda_{3} \\end{pmatrix}  \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3}  \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{2}  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\lambda_{2}^{2}  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\lambda_{3}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3538162"}, {"introduction": "A common point of confusion in kinematics is equating the absence of volume change with an absence of deformation.

The result $J=1$ signifies that the deformation is isochoric, or volume-preserving. This is consistent with the physical behavior of saturated granular soils under undrained shear, which often exhibit nearly isochoric deformation.\n\nThe problem requires a rigorous justification as to why the condition $J=1$ does not preclude significant distortional deformation. While the volume does not change, the shape of the material element can change. To quantify this change in shape, or distortion, we must use a finite strain measure. A robust way to characterize the deformation is by analyzing the principal stretches, which describe the extension or contraction of material lines that are mutually orthogonal in the reference configuration and remain so in the deformed configuration.\n\nThe principal stretches, denoted $\\lambda_i$, are the eigenvalues of the right stretch tensor $\\mathbf{U}$ or, equivalently, the square roots of the eigenvalues of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^T \\mathbf{F}$. If any $\\lambda_i \\neq 1$, the material has been stretched or compressed in that principal direction, indicating a change in shape (distortion).\n\nFirst, we compute $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^T \\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ \\gamma  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\gamma  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\gamma  0 \\\\ \\gamma  1+\\gamma^2  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{C}$ are the squares of the principal stretches, $\\lambda_i^2$.

The material is being stretched in one principal direction and compressed in another, changing its shape, even while its volume remains constant.\n\nThe problem asks to identify an explicit expression demonstrating the dependence of distortional stretch on $\\gamma$. The expression for the largest principal stretch,\n$$\n\\lambda_1(\\gamma) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}(2+\\gamma^2 + |\\gamma|\\sqrt{\\gamma^2+4})}\n$$\nserves this purpose perfectly.

As $|\\gamma|$ increases, $\\lambda_1$ monotonically increases, quantifying the growing distortion.

A change in observer is mathematically described by a superposed rigid body motion. If a deformation is described by the gradient $F$, an observer in a rotated frame will describe the same deformation by $F' = R F$, where $R \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is a proper orthogonal rotation matrix.\n\n1.  **Material Tensors**: Tensors defined in the reference (material) configuration, such as the Green-Lagrange strain $E$ or the right stretch tensor $U$, must be unaffected by a superposed rigid rotation. This is because these measures are intrinsic to the material's deformation state.\n    - Let $F' = R F$. The right Cauchy-Green tensor is $C' = (F')^{\\mathsf T}F' = (R F)^{\\mathsf T}(R F) = F^{\\mathsf T}R^{\\mathsf T}R F = F^{\\mathsf T}I F = F^{\\mathsf T}F = C$.\n    - Since $C$ is invariant, any function of $C$, like the right stretch tensor $U = \\sqrt{C}$ or the material strain tensor $S_L(F) = f(U)$, must also be invariant: $S_L(R F) = S_L(F)$.\n    - The problem correctly defines the material objectivity error as $\\eta_L=\\left\\|S_L(F)-S_L(R F)\\right\\|_F$, which should be zero for an exact rotation.\n\n2.  **Spatial Tensors**: Tensors defined in the current (spatial) configuration, such as the Euler-Almansi strain $e$ or the left stretch tensor $V$, must transform consistently with the rotation of the spatial frame. For a second-order tensor, this transformation rule (a push-forward operation) is $S_S(R F) = R S_S(F) R^{\\mathsf T}$.\n    - Let $F' = R F$. The left Cauchy-Green tensor (or Finger tensor) is $b' = F'(F')^{\\mathsf T} = (R F)(R F)^{\\mathsf T} = R F F^{\\mathsf T} R^{\\mathsf T} = R b R^{\\mathsf T}$.\n    - Since $b$ transforms this way, any isotropic function of $b$, such as the left stretch tensor $V=\\sqrt{b}$ or a spatial strain tensor $S_S(F) = g(V)$, will also follow this rule: $S_S(R F) = R S_S(F) R^{\\mathsf T}$.\n    - The problem correctly defines the spatial objectivity error as $\\eta_S=\\left\\|R S_S(F) R^{\\mathsf T}-S_S(R F)\\right\\|_F$, which should also be zero.\n\n#### Strain Measures\nThe problem requires the evaluation of several standard strain measures:\n-   **Green-Lagrange strain**: $E = \\frac{1}{2}(C-I)$. It is a material tensor. For $m=2$, the material Seth-Hill strain $E_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(U^2-I) = \\frac{1}{2}(C-I) = E$.\n-   **Euler-Almansi strain**: $e = \\frac{1}{2}(I-b^{-1})$. It is a spatial tensor. For $m=2$, the spatial Seth-Hill strain is $e_2=\\frac{1}{2}(I-V^{-2})=\\frac{1}{2}(I-b^{-1})=e$.\n-   **Hencky (logarithmic) strain**: $h_L = \\log U$ (material) and $h_S=\\log V$ (spatial). These are obtained as the limits of the Seth-Hill families as $m \\to 0$. They are often considered the most \"natural\" strain measures due to properties like additivity for coaxial deformation increments.\n\n#### Computational Implementation\nThe core of the task is to implement these concepts numerically. This requires functions for matrix algebra, including a robust method for computing matrix functions like the square root, logarithm, and arbitrary real powers. The `scipy.linalg` library provides these capabilities.\n-   `scipy.linalg.sqrtm(A)`: Computes the principal matrix square root. For a symmetric positive-definite matrix like $C$ or $b$, the result is unique, real, and symmetric positive-definite.\n-   `scipy.linalg.logm(A)`: Computes the principal matrix logarithm.\n-   `scipy.linalg.funm(A, func)`: Computes a general matrix function `func(A)`. This is ideal for calculating $U^m$ and $V^{-m}$ for real $m$.\n\nThe workflow for each test case $(\\gamma, \\theta, \\varepsilon)$ is as follows:\n1.  Construct the base deformation gradient $F_1 = F_{\\text{shear}}(\\gamma)$.\n2.  Construct the rotation operator $\\widehat{R}$, which is the pure rotation $R(\\theta)$ if $\\varepsilon=0$ or the perturbed matrix $\\tilde{R}(\\theta, \\varepsilon)$ if $\\varepsilon0$.\n3.  Construct the superposed deformation gradient $F_2 = \\widehat{R} F_1$.\n4.  For both $F_1$ and $F_2$, compute all required strain tensors: $E, e, h_L, h_S$, and the Seth-Hill families $E_m, e_m$ for $m \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$.\n5.  Using these computed tensors, calculate the six specified objectivity error norms ($\\eta_E, \\eta_e, \\eta_{h_L}, \\eta_{h_S}, \\eta_{\\text{SH-L}}^{\\max}, \\eta_{\\text{SH-S}}^{\\max}$) using the Frobenius norm (`numpy.linalg.norm(..., 'fro')`).\n6.  For the cases with $\\varepsilon  0$, the matrix $\\widehat{R}$ is not orthogonal. Therefore, the transformation $F_1 \\to F_2$ is not a rigid body motion. As a result, the objectivity conditions are not expected to hold, and the error norms will be non-zero, quantifying the deviation from objective behavior caused by the non-rigidity of the transformation.\nFor the case $\\varepsilon=0$, all error norms should be zero, up to machine precision.\n\nThis computational experiment provides a clear, quantitative demonstration of the objectivity principle and the consequences of its violation in a numerical context.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import linalg\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs and executes a deterministic computational experiment to quantify\n    the objectivity of several finite strain measures under large simple shear\n    with a superposed rigid body rotation, including numerical noise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the noise matrix N as per the problem statement\n    N = np.array([\n        [0.0, 1.0, -2.0],\n        [-1.5, 0.0, 0.5],\n        [1.0, -0.25, 0.0]\n    ])\n\n    # Define the deterministic test suite\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.2, 0.6, 0.0),\n        (3.5, 1.8, 1e-8),\n        (10.0, np.pi / 2, 1e-3),\n        (0.0, 2.2, 5e-4),\n    ]\n\n    # Parameter set for Seth-Hill families\n    m_set = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}\n    \n    all_results = []\n\n    def compute_all_strains(F, m_values):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes all required strain measures for a given deformation gradient F.\n        \"\"\"\n        strains = {}\n        I = np.identity(3)\n\n        # Ensure F is invertible before proceeding\n        if np.linalg.det(F) == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Deformation gradient is singular.\")\n\n        # Right and Left Cauchy-Green tensors\n        C = F.T @ F\n        b = F @ F.T\n\n        # Stretch tensors U and V\n        # Use np.real to discard negligible imaginary parts from numerical errors\n        U = np.real(linalg.sqrtm(C))\n        V = np.real(linalg.sqrtm(b))\n\n        # Green-Lagrange strain\n        strains['E'] = 0.5 * (C - I)\n        \n        # Euler-Almansi strain\n        b_inv = linalg.inv(b)\n        strains['e'] = 0.5 * (I - b_inv)\n        \n        # Hencky strains\n        strains['h_L'] = np.real(linalg.logm(U))\n        strains['h_S'] = np.real(linalg.logm(V))\n        \n        # Seth-Hill families\n        strains['E_m'] = {}\n        strains['e_m'] = {}\n        for m in m_values:\n            if m == 0:\n                strains['E_m'][m] = strains['h_L']\n                strains['e_m'][m] = strains['h_S']\n            else:\n                # Material Seth-Hill E_m\n                U_m = np.real(linalg.funm(U, lambda x: x**m))\n                strains['E_m'][m] = (1.0 / m) * (U_m - I)\n                \n                # Spatial Seth-Hill e_m\n                # Note: linalg.funm correctly handles negative powers\n                V_neg_m = np.real(linalg.funm(V, lambda x: x**(-m)))\n                strains['e_m'][m] = (1.0 / m) * (I - V_neg_m)\n        \n        return strains\n\n    for gamma, theta, epsilon in test_cases:\n        case_results = []\n\n        # Construct deformation gradients\n        F_shear = np.array([\n            [1.0, gamma, 0.0],\n            [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],\n            [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]\n        ])\n        \n        R_theta = np.array([\n            [np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta), 0.0],\n            [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta), 0.0],\n            [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]\n        ])\n\n        if epsilon == 0:\n            R_hat = R_theta\n        else:\n            R_hat = R_theta + epsilon * N\n\n        F1 = F_shear\n        F2 = R_hat @ F_shear\n\n        # Compute all strain measures for F1 and F2\n        strains1 = compute_all_strains(F1, m_set)\n        strains2 = compute_all_strains(F2, m_set)\n\n        # Calculate objectivity errors\n        # 1.
