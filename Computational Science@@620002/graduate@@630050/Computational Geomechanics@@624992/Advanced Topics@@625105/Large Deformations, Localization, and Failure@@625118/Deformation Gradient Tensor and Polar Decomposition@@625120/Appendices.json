We will proceed with its solution by rigorously applying the fundamental definitions as stipulated.\n\nThe deformation gradient tensor $\\mathbf{F}$ is provided in a fixed orthonormal basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3\\}$ of the reference configuration. Its matrix representation is:\n$$\n[F] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda > 0$ is a scalar stretch ratio.\n\nFirst, we determine the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{C}$. By definition, $\\mathbf{C}$ is given by the product $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^T \\mathbf{F}$. Since the matrix representation of $\\mathbf{F}$ is diagonal, it is identical to its transpose, $[F]^T = [F]$. The calculation is elementary:\n$$\n[C] = [F]^T [F] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, $\\mathbf{C} = \\lambda^2 \\mathbf{e}_1 \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_1 + \\mathbf{e}_2 \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3 \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_3$.\n\nNext, we address the right polar decomposition of the deformation gradient, $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{U}$, where $\\mathbf{R}$ is a proper orthogonal tensor representing rotation and $\\mathbf{U}$ is the symmetric positive-definite right stretch tensor. From this decomposition, it follows that $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^T \\mathbf{F} = (\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{U})^T (\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{U}) = \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{U}$. Since $\\mathbf{R}$ is orthogonal, $\\mathbf{R}^T\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{I}$, and since $\\mathbf{U}$ is symmetric, $\\mathbf{U}^T = \\mathbf{U}$. This simplifies to $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{U}^2$. The right stretch tensor $\\mathbf{U}$ is therefore the unique positive-definite square root of $\\mathbf{C}$.\n\nGiven that $[C]$ is a diagonal matrix with positive entries ($\\lambda^2 > 0$, $1 > 0$), its principal square root is found by taking the square root of each diagonal element:\n$$\n[U] = \\sqrt{[C]} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\lambda^2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe used the fact that $\\lambda > 0$ to write $\\sqrt{\\lambda^2} = \\lambda$. The tensor $\\mathbf{U}$ is symmetric. Its eigenvalues are $\\lambda$, $1$, and $1$. As $\\lambda>0$, all eigenvalues are positive, confirming that $\\mathbf{U}$ is positive-definite. It is evident from inspection that $[U] = [F]$ in this specific case.\n\nWith $\\mathbf{U}$ determined, we find the rotation tensor $\\mathbf{R}$ from the decomposition $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{U}$. Since $\\mathbf{U}$ is invertible (its determinant is $\\lambda > 0$), we can write $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{U}^{-1}$. The inverse of the diagonal matrix $[U]$ is trivial to compute:\n$$\n[U]^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we perform the matrix multiplication for $[R]$:\n$$\n[R] = [F] [U]^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the identity matrix, $[I]$. Thus, $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{I}$. This result is physically logical: a pure stretch along a coordinate axis without any shear component involves no rotation. The tensor $\\mathbf{I}$ is indeed proper orthogonal, as $\\mathbf{I}^T\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}$ and $\\det(\\mathbf{I}) = 1$.\n\nFinally, we determine the principal stretches and their corresponding directions. By definition, these are the eigenvalues and normalized eigenvectors, respectively, of the right stretch tensor $\\mathbf{U}$. Since $[U]$ is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries. The principal stretches are therefore $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$, $\\lambda_2 = 1$, and $\\lambda_3 = 1$.\n\nThe corresponding principal directions $\\mathbf{N}_i$ are found by solving the eigenvalue problem $(\\mathbf{U} - \\lambda_i \\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{N}_i = \\mathbf{0}$.\nFor $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$:\nThe eigenvectors are the basis vectors of the null space of $(\\mathbf{U} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I})$.\n$$\n[U] - \\lambda[I] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1-\\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIf $\\lambda \\neq 1$, this matrix maps any vector $(N_1, N_2, N_3)^T$ to $(0, (1-\\lambda)N_2, (1-\\lambda)N_3)^T$. For this to be the zero vector, $N_2=0$ and $N_3=0$. $N_1$ is arbitrary. The normalized eigenvector is $\\mathbf{N}_1 = (1, 0, 0)^T$, which corresponds to the basis vector $\\mathbf{e}_1$.\n\nFor the repeated eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = 1$:\nThe eigenvectors are the basis vectors of the null space of $(\\mathbf{U} - 1 \\cdot \\mathbf{I})$.\n$$\n[U] - 1[I] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda-1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIf $\\lambda \\neq 1$, this matrix maps $(N_1, N_2, N_3)^T$ to $((\\lambda-1)N_1, 0, 0)^T$. For this to be the zero vector, $N_1=0$. $N_2$ and $N_3$ are arbitrary. This defines a two-dimensional eigenspace, the plane spanned by $\\mathbf{e}_2$ and $\\mathbf{e}_3$. Any vector in this plane is a principal direction with stretch $1$. We must choose an orthonormal basis for this space. The canonical choice is $\\mathbf{N}_2 = (0, 1, 0)^T = \\mathbf{e}_2$ and $\\mathbf{N}_3 = (0, 0, 1)^T = \\mathbf{e}_3$.\n\nIf $\\lambda=1$, then $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{I}$ and $\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{I}$. This corresponds to no deformation. All stretches are $1$, and any direction is a principal direction. The choice of $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3\\}$ as the set of orthonormal principal directions remains valid.\n\nTherefore, the principal stretches are $\\{\\lambda, 1, 1\\}$, and a corresponding set of orthonormal principal directions in the reference configuration is $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3\\}$. The matrix whose columns are these directions is the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$.\n\nWe compile the results in the required order: $\\mathbf{C}$, $\\mathbf{U}$, $\\mathbf{R}$, the column vector of principal stretches, and the matrix of principal directions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n&\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n&\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n&\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n&\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2886394"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of pure stretch, we now turn to simple shear, a ubiquitous deformation mode in geomechanics.

If we assume this simplified interpretation was intended for *both* the PS and AX assumptions, despite the explicit mention of \"polar decomposition\" for PS, the problem becomes consistent with one of the options. This suggests a slight imprecision in the problem statement, where \"perform a polar decomposition\" might be used loosely to mean \"extract the 2D rotation angle\" by this simplified method.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed valid under the assumption of a specific, plausible interpretation that resolves the ambiguity and aligns with the structure of the provided options. The imprecision will be noted, but we shall proceed to a solution based on this inferred interpretation.\n\n**Working Interpretation:** For both the Plane Strain and Axisymmetric assumptions, the in-plane rotation angle $\\varphi$ will be extracted from the $(x,y)$ sub-block of the deformation gradient $F$ (here, $R$) using the formula $\\varphi = \\operatorname{atan2}(R_{21}, R_{11})$.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $c\\theta = \\cos\\theta$ and $s\\theta = \\sin\\theta$.
