The critical state line in the void ratio–mean effective stress space is assumed to be linear in the natural logarithm of mean effective stress, such that the critical state void ratio $e_{\\text{cs}}$ depends on the mean effective stress $p'$ via the relation $e_{\\text{cs}}(p')$ with parameters $(\\Gamma, \\lambda)$ and a reference pressure $p_{\\text{ref}}$ used to render the argument of the logarithm dimensionless. The mean effective stress $p'$ is defined as one-third of the first invariant of the effective stress tensor, and under isotropic consolidation $p'$ equals the isotropic effective confining stress.

It is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, presenting a standard problem within the established framework of Critical State Soil Mechanics (CSSM). All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the parameters are physically realistic. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the initial state parameter, $\\psi_0$, for a given saturated sand specimen and to interpret its sign to determine the soil's mechanical behavior under shear and its susceptibility to liquefaction.\n\nThe state parameter, $\\psi$, is defined as the difference between the current void ratio, $e$, and the critical state void ratio, $e_{\\text{cs}}$, at the current mean effective stress, $p'$:\n$$\n\\psi = e - e_{\\text{cs}}(p')\n$$\nA positive value of $\\psi$ indicates that the soil is looser than its critical state for a given $p'$, a condition often described as being on the \"wet\" side of the critical state line. A negative value indicates the soil is denser than its critical state, or on the \"dry\" side.\n\nThe problem states that the critical state line (CSL) is linear in the void ratio–mean effective stress space, where the stress axis is logarithmic. This relationship is formally expressed as:\n$$\ne_{\\text{cs}}(p') = \\Gamma - \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{p'}{p_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the critical state void ratio at the reference pressure $p_{\\text{ref}}$, and $\\lambda$ is the slope of the CSL in the $e-\\ln p'$ space.\n\nThe given parameters for the sand are:\n- Critical state parameters: $\\Gamma = 0.92$ and $\\lambda = 0.06$.\n- Reference pressure: $p_{\\text{ref}} = 100\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n- Initial state: void ratio $e_0 = 0.93$ at mean effective stress $p_0' = 200\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the critical state void ratio, $e_{\\text{cs}}$, corresponding to the initial mean effective stress, $p_0' = 200\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n$$\ne_{\\text{cs}}(p_0') = \\Gamma - \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0'}{p_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\ne_{\\text{cs}}(200\\ \\text{kPa}) = 0.92 - 0.06 \\ln\\left(\\frac{200\\ \\text{kPa}}{100\\ \\text{kPa}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\ne_{\\text{cs}}(200\\ \\text{kPa}) = 0.92 - 0.06 \\ln(2)\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$\ne_{\\text{cs}}(200\\ \\text{kPa}) \\approx 0.92 - 0.06 \\times 0.693147\n$$\n$$\ne_{\\text{cs}}(200\\ \\text{kPa}) \\approx 0.92 - 0.04158882 \\approx 0.87841118\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the initial state parameter, $\\psi_0$, using the initial void ratio, $e_0 = 0.93$, and the calculated critical state void ratio at the initial stress.\n$$\n\\psi_0 = e_0 - e_{\\text{cs}}(p_0')\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_0 \\approx 0.93 - 0.87841118\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_0 \\approx 0.05158882\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\psi_0 \\approx 0.05159\n$$\n\nNow, we must interpret this result. Since $\\psi_0 \\approx 0.05159 > 0$, the initial state of the soil is looser than the critical state. This indicates that the soil is **contractive**. Under undrained shearing, a contractive soil has a tendency to decrease in volume. Because the pore fluid (water) cannot drain, this volumetric tendency translates into an increase in pore water pressure ($u$).\n\nThe liquefaction tendency is directly linked to this contractive behavior. According to the principle of effective stress ($p' = p - u$, where $p$ is total stress), an increase in pore water pressure $u$ causes a decrease in mean effective stress $p'$. Under undrained cyclic loading, each cycle can induce a net increase in pore pressure, leading to a progressive reduction in effective stress. When the effective stress approaches zero ($p' \\to 0$), the soil loses its shear strength and stiffness, exhibiting fluid-like behavior known as liquefaction.\n\nTherefore, because the soil has a positive initial state parameter ($\\psi_0 > 0$), it is contractive and thus highly susceptible to pore pressure generation and subsequent liquefaction under undrained cyclic loading conditions at its current mean effective stress.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.05159}\n$$", "id": "3520249"}, {"introduction": "Once a soil is identified as susceptible to liquefaction, the practical engineering question becomes: how many loading cycles can it withstand before failing?

Plastic flow initiates when the stress state reaches the yield surface, i.e., $f(s) = 0$, and is maintained during loading.\n\nThe numerical solution is achieved by discretizing the loading history into uniform time steps $\\Delta t$ and applying an explicit integration scheme, specifically an elastic-predictor, plastic-corrector algorithm (return mapping). For each time increment from $t_i$ to $t_{i+1}$, with the state $(\\gamma_{p,i}, b_i)$ known at $t_i$ and the total strain $\\gamma_{i+1}$ prescribed at $t_{i+1}$, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Elastic Predictor**: A trial stress state is computed by assuming the entire strain increment is elastic.\n    $$\n    \\tau_\\text{trial} = G_0 (\\gamma_{i+1} - \\gamma_{p,i})\n    $$\n    The corresponding trial effective stress is:\n    $$\n    s_\\text{trial} = \\tau_\\text{trial} - b_i\n    $$\n\n2.  **Yield Check**: The trial state is checked against the yield criterion.\n    - If $|s_\\text{trial}| \\le \\tau_y$, the assumption is valid.

The increment in dissipated plastic work per unit volume, $\\Delta W_p$, is computed as:\n    $$\n    \\Delta W_{p,i+1} = s_{i+1} \\cdot \\Delta\\gamma_p = (\\tau_y \\cdot \\mathrm{sign}(s_\\text{trial})) \\cdot (\\Delta\\lambda \\cdot \\mathrm{sign}(s_\\text trial)) = \\tau_y \\Delta\\lambda = \\tau_y |\\Delta\\gamma_p|\n    $$\n    The cumulative dissipated work $W_p$ is updated: $W_{p,i+1} = W_{p,i} + \\Delta W_{p,i+1}$.\n\nFinally, after integrating over the full duration $T$, the total dissipated plastic work $W_p(T)$ is used to compute the pore pressure ratio $r_u(T)$ via the provided empirical model:\n$$\nr_u(T) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_p(T)}{W_p^\\star}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $W_p^\\star$ is a material parameter.
