It can predict tensile stresses (negative pressures) due to the cohesion term $c^{\\prime}$. However, the interface between the soil and the retaining wall is a frictional contact. Soils, being particulate materials, and their interfaces with structures like walls, generally cannot sustain significant tensile forces. When the theory predicts a tensile stress $\\sigma_h  0$, it implies the wall would need to pull on the soil to maintain contact. Physically, this is impossible. The soil simply separates from the wall, forming a gap known as a \"tension crack\". Within this gap, the pressure exerted on the wall is zero, not negative. This is a crucial aspect of soil-structure interaction. Therefore, any computed negative pressures are physically inadmissible at the boundary, and the stress distribution is truncated at zero for practical design.\n\n- **Condition for No Lateral Earth Pressure**: The wall would experience no lateral earth pressure if the theoretical pressure distribution is non-positive over its entire height. The active pressure $\\sigma_h(z) = K_a \\gamma z - 2c'\\sqrt{K_a}$ is a linearly increasing function of depth $z$. It is most negative at the surface ($z=0$) and increases to its maximum value at the base of the wall ($z=H$). If the pressure at the base of the wall is zero or negative, it will be negative for all $z \\in [0, H)$. The condition for no resultant lateral pressure is therefore $\\sigma_h(H) \\leq 0$.\n$$\nK_a \\gamma H - 2c^{\\prime}\\sqrt{K_a} \\leq 0\n$$\n$$\nK_a \\gamma H \\leq 2c^{\\prime}\\sqrt{K_a}\n$$\n$$\nH \\leq \\frac{2c^{\\prime}}{\\gamma \\sqrt{K_a}}\n$$\nThis is precisely the condition $H \\leq z_t$. If the height of the wall is less than or equal to the theoretical tension crack depth, a crack can form over the full height of the wall, and the soil can stand vertically without support from the wall. In this case, the net thrust $P_a$ on the wall is zero. This height is known as the critical height of an unsupported vertical cut.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{78.44}\n$$", "id": "3500120"}, {"introduction": "This final practice shifts our focus from yielding walls to braced excavations, where wall movement is restrained, creating an \"at-rest\" state in the soil.

The pore water pressure, $u$, is hydrostatic, as the groundwater table is at the surface.\n$$\nu(z) = \\gamma_w z\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma_w$ is the unit weight of water.\n\nThe total vertical stress is the same as before: $\\sigma_v(z) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} z$. The vertical effective stress, $\\sigma'_v$, is given by the principle of effective stress:\n$$\n\\sigma'_v(z) = \\sigma_v(z) - u(z) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} z - \\gamma_w z = (\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w) z\n$$\nThe problem specifies an at-rest effective stress condition. The horizontal effective stress, $\\sigma'_h$, is related to the vertical effective stress by the effective stress coefficient of earth pressure at rest, $K_0$:\n$$\n\\sigma'_h(z) = K_0 \\sigma'_v(z)\n$$\nFor a normally consolidated clay, $K_0$ can be estimated using Jaky's empirical formula:\n$$\nK_0 = 1 - \\sin(\\varphi')\n$$\nwhere $\\varphi'$ is the effective stress friction angle.\n\nThe long-term total lateral pressure on the wall, $p_{\\ell t}(z)$, is the sum of the horizontal effective stress and the pore water pressure:\n$$\np_{\\ell t}(z) = \\sigma'_h(z) + u(z) = K_0 \\sigma'_v(z) + u(z)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_0$, $\\sigma'_v(z)$, and $u(z)$:\n$$\np_{\\ell t}(z) = (1 - \\sin(\\varphi'))(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w)z + \\gamma_w z\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\np_{\\ell t}(z) = \\left[ (1 - \\sin(\\varphi'))(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w) + \\gamma_w \\right] z\n$$\nThe resultant long-term lateral load per unit wall length, $P_{\\ell t}$, is the integral of this pressure distribution:\n$$\nP_{\\ell t} = \\int_{0}^{H} p_{\\ell t}(z) \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{H} \\left[ (1 - \\sin(\\varphi'))(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w) + \\gamma_w \\right] z \\, dz\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\nP_{\\ell t} = \\left[ (1 - \\sin(\\varphi'))(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w) + \\gamma_w \\right] \\left[ \\frac{z^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{H} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (1 - \\sin(\\varphi'))(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w) + \\gamma_w \\right] H^2\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Ratio of Resultants**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the undrained (short-term) resultant to the long-term resultant.\n$$\nR = \\frac{P_u}{P_{\\ell t}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} H^2}{\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (1 - \\sin(\\varphi'))(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w) + \\gamma_w \\right] H^2}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{2} H^2$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{(1 - \\sin(\\varphi'))(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w) + \\gamma_w}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{kN/m^3}$\n$\\gamma_w = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{kN/m^3}$\n$\\varphi' = 25^{\\circ}$\n\nFirst, calculate the terms in the denominator.\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\gamma_w = 18 - 9.81 = 8.19\\,\\mathrm{kN/m^3}$\n$\\sin(\\varphi') = \\sin(25^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.422618$\n$1 - \\sin(\\varphi') = 1 - 0.422618 = 0.577382$\n\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$\n(0.577382)(8.19) + 9.81 = 4.728758 + 9.81 = 14.538758\n$$\nNow, compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{18}{14.538758} \\approx 1.23807\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as required:\n$$\nR \\approx 1.238\n$$\nThe undrained shear strength, $s_u = 50\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, was not used in the calculations but confirms the validity of the at-rest assumption in the short-term. The maximum shear stress in the at-rest state under undrained condition is $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}|\\sigma_v - \\sigma_h| = 0$, which is less than $s_u$, so the soil mass is stable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.238}$$", "id": "3500144"}]}
