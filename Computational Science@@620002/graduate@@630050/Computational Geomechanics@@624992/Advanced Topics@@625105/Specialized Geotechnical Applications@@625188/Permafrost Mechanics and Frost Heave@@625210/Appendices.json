For a pure, single-component substance, the chemical potential is equivalent to the specific Gibbs free energy, denoted by $g$. Thus, the equilibrium condition is:\n$$g_i(p_i, T) = g_w(p_w, T)$$\nwhere the subscripts $i$ and $w$ denote ice and water, respectively.\n\nConsider a differential change in system parameters $(p_i, p_w, T)$ that maintains equilibrium. This requires that the change in specific Gibbs free energy for each phase be equal, which is not strictly correct. Instead, we analyze the condition $g_i(p_i, T) = g_w(p_w, T)$ for a state $(p_i, p_w, T)$ near a known reference equilibrium state $(p_0, T_m)$, where $p_0$ is a reference pressure at which ice and water coexist at the bulk melting temperature $T_m$. At this reference state, $g_i(p_0, T_m) = g_w(p_0, T_m)$.\n\nThe fundamental Gibbs relation for the differential of the specific Gibbs free energy is:\n$$dg = v dp - s dT$$\nwhere $v$ is the specific volume ($v = 1/\\rho$, where $\\rho$ is density) and $s$ is the specific entropy.\n\nTo find the relationship at the state $(p_i, p_w, T)$, we can integrate the Gibbs relation for each phase from the reference state $(p_0, T_m)$. For small deviations from the reference state, we can treat the specific volumes and entropies as constants, equal to their values at $(p_0, T_m)$.\n\nFor the water phase:\n$$g_w(p_w, T) - g_w(p_0, T_m) = \\int_{(p_0, T_m)}^{(p_w, T)} (v_w dp - s_w dT) \\approx v_w(p_w - p_0) - s_w(T - T_m)$$\n\nFor the ice phase:\n$$g_i(p_i, T) - g_i(p_0, T_m) = \\int_{(p_0, T_m)}^{(p_i, T)} (v_i dp - s_i dT) \\approx v_i(p_i - p_0) - s_i(T - T_m)$$\n\nSince $g_w(p_w, T) = g_i(p_i, T)$ and $g_w(p_0, T_m) = g_i(p_0, T_m)$, the left-hand sides of the two approximate equations are equal. Therefore:\n$$v_w(p_w - p_0) - s_w(T - T_m) = v_i(p_i - p_0) - s_i(T - T_m)$$\n\nRearranging the terms to group pressures and temperatures:\n$$v_i(p_i - p_0) - v_w(p_w - p_0) = (s_i - s_w)(T - T_m)$$\n$$v_i p_i - v_w p_w - p_0(v_i - v_w) = (s_i - s_w)(T - T_m)$$\n\nThe difference in specific entropy at the phase transition is related to the latent heat of fusion per unit mass, $L$, by the relation $s_w - s_i = L/T$. For temperatures close to $T_m$, we use the approximation $s_w - s_i \\approx L/T_m$, which implies $s_i - s_w \\approx -L/T_m$. Substituting this gives:\n$$v_i p_i - v_w p_w - p_0(v_i - v_w) \\approx -\\frac{L}{T_m}(T - T_m)$$\n\nThe problem defines the undercooling as $\\Delta T = T_m - T$, which means $T - T_m = -\\Delta T$. Substituting this into the equation yields:\n$$v_i p_i - v_w p_w - p_0(v_i - v_w) \\approx -\\frac{L}{T_m}(-\\Delta T) = \\frac{L \\Delta T}{T_m}$$\n\nThis is a generalized form of the Clapeyron equation. The problem requires an expression for $\\Delta p = p_i - p_w$ in terms of $L$, $\\rho_w$, and $T_m$ only, which implies that terms involving $\\rho_i$ or the reference pressure $p_0$ should not appear in the final expression.\n\nThe most direct way to achieve this, and a common simplification in this context, is to neglect the change in volume upon fusion. This assumes that the specific volume of ice is approximately equal to that of water, i.e., $v_i \\approx v_w = 1/\\rho_w$. This simplification is equivalent to assuming $\\rho_i \\approx \\rho_w$. While there is an approximately $8\\%$ difference in reality, this assumption isolates the dominant thermal effect.\n\nUnder this assumption, $v_i - v_w \\approx 0$. The equation simplifies significantly:\n$$v_w p_i - v_w p_w \\approx \\frac{L \\Delta T}{T_m}$$\n$$v_w (p_i - p_w) \\approx \\frac{L \\Delta T}{T_m}$$\n\nSubstituting $v_w = 1/\\rho_w$ and $\\Delta p = p_i - p_w$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\rho_w} \\Delta p = \\frac{L \\Delta T}{T_m}$$\n\nSolving for $\\Delta p$, we get the desired linearized expression:\n$$\\Delta p = \\rho_w L \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_m}$$\nThis is the simplified Clausius-Clapeyron equation as applied to this problem.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $\\Delta p$ for an undercooling of $\\Delta T = 1\\ \\text{K}$. The given constants are:\n- Latent heat of fusion, $L = 3.34 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{J/kg}$\n- Density of water, $\\rho_w = 1000\\ \\text{kg/m}^3$\n- Bulk melting temperature, $T_m = 273\\ \\text{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\\Delta p = (1000\\ \\text{kg/m}^3) \\times (3.34 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{J/kg}) \\times \\frac{1\\ \\text{K}}{273\\ \\text{K}}$$\n$$\\Delta p = \\frac{3.34 \\times 10^8}{273}\\ \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^3}$$\n\nThe unit $\\text{J/m}^3$ is equivalent to $\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m} / \\text{m}^3 = \\text{N/m}^2$, which is Pascals (Pa).\n$$\\Delta p \\approx 1223443.2\\ \\text{Pa}$$\n$$\\Delta p \\approx 1.2234432 \\times 10^6\\ \\text{Pa}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in kilopascals (kPa), rounded to three significant figures.\n$1\\ \\text{kPa} = 1000\\ \\text{Pa}$.\n$$\\Delta p \\approx 1223.44\\ \\text{kPa}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta p = 1220\\ \\text{kPa}$$\n\n**Part 3: Commentary on Magnitude**\n\nThe calculated pressure difference, $\\Delta p = 1220\\ \\text{kPa}$, is the potential pressure that can develop between the ice and the adjacent unfrozen water for an undercooling of just $1\\ \\text{K}$. This value is to be compared with a typical vertical overburden stress of $\\sigma_v = 100\\ \\text{kPa}$ in shallow frozen ground.\n\nThe calculated $\\Delta p$ is more than an order of magnitude larger than the typical overburden stress ($\\Delta p \\approx 12.2 \\times \\sigma_v$). In the context of frost heave mechanics, this pressure difference, often referred to as cryosuction, is the thermodynamic driving force that draws water towards the advancing freezing front. The pressure in the ice, $p_i$, is transmitted to the surrounding soil matrix. If this ice pressure exceeds the confining stress (overburden pressure plus soil strength), it will physically push the soil particles apart, leading to the formation and growth of a pure ice body, known as an ice lens. This process of ice segregation is the fundamental mechanism of frost heave.\n\nThe fact that a very small undercooling of $1\\ \\text{K}$ can thermodynamically generate a pressure far exceeding typical shallow overburden pressures demonstrates why frost heave can exert immense forces, capable of lifting buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. This calculation highlights the critical role of thermodynamics in governing the mechanics of frozen soils.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1220}$$", "id": "3549967"}, {"introduction": "Cryosuction provides the driving force, but the visible manifestation of frost heave is the upward displacement of the ground surface.

It poses a solvable question based on fundamental principles of mass conservation in the context of frost heave, a topic central to permafrost mechanics. All necessary data and simplifying assumptions are provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the heave rate, $\\dot{h}$, which is the velocity of the ground surface uplift due to the formation of a segregated ice lens. This derivation is based on the principle of mass conservation applied at the freezing front.\n\nLet us consider a control volume of uniform cross-sectional area $A$ that encompasses the planar freezing front. The problem specifies a one-dimensional ($1$D) configuration, so all fluxes and movements are normal to this area. The incoming water mass flux, $q$, has units of mass per unit area per unit time. The total mass of water entering the control volume over an infinitesimal time interval $dt$ is given by:\n$$dM_w = q \\cdot A \\cdot dt$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, this water freezes to form a segregated ice lens. The principle of mass conservation dictates that the mass of water entering the freezing front must be equal to the mass of ice formed. Let $dM_i$ be the mass of ice formed in the time interval $dt$. Then:\n$$dM_i = dM_w = q \\cdot A \\cdot dt$$\n\nThe volume of this newly formed ice, $dV_i$, is related to its mass $dM_i$ and density $\\rho_i$. The problem states that ice is incompressible, so its density is constant. The relationship is:\n$$dV_i = \\frac{dM_i}{\\rho_i}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $dM_i$:\n$$dV_i = \\frac{q \\cdot A \\cdot dt}{\\rho_i}$$\n\nThe problem also states that the heave is due to the thickening of this segregated ice lens. The heave, $h$, is the thickness of the ice lens. The incremental volume of the ice lens, $dV_i$, can also be expressed as the product of the cross-sectional area $A$ and the incremental increase in thickness, $dh$:\n$$dV_i = A \\cdot dh$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the infinitesimal volume of ice $dV_i$, we have:\n$$A \\cdot dh = \\frac{q \\cdot A \\cdot dt}{\\rho_i}$$\n\nThe cross-sectional area $A$ is uniform and non-zero, so it can be canceled from both sides of the equation:\n$$dh = \\frac{q}{\\rho_i} \\cdot dt$$\n\nThe heave rate, $\\dot{h}$, is defined as the rate of change of heave with respect to time, which is $\\frac{dh}{dt}$.

The derivation will be based on combining Darcy's law with a capillary-bundle model and several microstructural scaling hypotheses.\n\nThe macroscopic volumetric flux, or Darcy velocity $v$, through a porous medium is described by Darcy's law. In terms of hydraulic head $h$, it is given by $v = -K \\nabla h$, where $K$ is the hydraulic conductivity. For a one-dimensional flow over a length $L$ with a head difference $\\Delta h$, the total volumetric flow rate $Q$ through a total cross-sectional area $A$ is $Q = A K \\frac{\\Delta h}{L}$.
