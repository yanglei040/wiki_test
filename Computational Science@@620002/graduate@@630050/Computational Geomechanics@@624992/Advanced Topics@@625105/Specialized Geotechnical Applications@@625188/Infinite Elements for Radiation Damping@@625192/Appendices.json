Let a planar artificial boundary segment of area $A$ be introduced in a Finite Element (FE) model to truncate the computational domain while attempting to reproduce radiation damping by absorbing outgoing waves. The goal is to derive local, velocity-proportional boundary forces $F_{n}$ and $F_{t}$ in the normal and tangential directions, respectively, so that outgoing Primary (P) and Secondary (S) plane waves pass through the boundary without reflection. Starting from the linear momentum balance, Hooke’s law for an isotropic solid, and the plane wave form of elastodynamic solutions, use wave impedance arguments to obtain the expressions for the dashpot coefficients $c_{n}$ and $c_{t}$ defined by $F_{n}=c_{n} v_{n}$ and $F_{t}=c_{t} v_{t}$, where $v_{n}$ and $v_{t}$ are the normal and tangential particle velocities at the boundary.

It is a well-posed problem in computational elastodynamics, grounded in the fundamental principles of wave propagation in elastic solids. It provides sufficient information to derive the expressions for the viscous dashpot coefficients under the standard assumptions of plane waves at normal incidence.\n\nThe objective is to find boundary forces, proportional to velocity, that absorb outgoing waves perfectly. This is equivalent to finding the relationship between traction and particle velocity for a plane wave traveling in an infinite medium. This relationship defines the impedance of the medium. An artificial boundary condition that enforces this relationship will not reflect energy back into the computational domain, thus simulating an infinite medium.\n\nLet the artificial boundary be a plane, for instance, $x_1=0$, with the finite element domain in the region $x_1 < 0$. The outgoing waves travel in the positive $x_1$-direction. The traction vector on this boundary plane is given by $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor and $\\mathbf{n}=(1, 0, 0)$ is the outward normal vector. The components of the traction vector are $t_1 = \\sigma_{11}$ (normal traction) and $t_2 = \\sigma_{12}$, $t_3 = \\sigma_{13}$ (tangential tractions). We will analyze the cases of pure compressional (P) waves and pure shear (S) waves arriving at normal incidence to the boundary.\n\n**1. Compressional (P) Wave at Normal Incidence**\n\nConsider a plane P-wave propagating in the positive $x_1$-direction. The displacement field is given by $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, 0, 0)$, where $u_1$ is a function of $(x_1, t)$. For a wave traveling in the $+x_1$ direction with speed $c_p$, the displacement can be written as:\n$$\nu_1(x_1, t) = f(t - \\frac{x_1}{c_p})\n$$\nThe particle velocity in the normal direction, $v_n = v_1$, is:\n$$\nv_n = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial t} = f'(t - \\frac{x_1}{c_p})\n$$\nThe only non-zero strain component is the normal strain $\\epsilon_{11}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11} = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_1} = f'(t - \\frac{x_1}{c_p}) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{c_p}\\right)\n$$\nBy comparing the expressions for velocity and strain, we establish the key relationship:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11} = -\\frac{1}{c_p} v_n\n$$\nFor a linear isotropic elastic material, the normal stress $\\sigma_{11}$ is given by Hooke's law. For a plane wave condition ($\\epsilon_{22} = \\epsilon_{33} = 0$), this is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\epsilon_{11}\n$$\nThe compressional wave speed $c_p$ is defined as $c_p = \\sqrt{(\\lambda+2\\mu)/\\rho}$, which gives $(\\lambda+2\\mu) = \\rho c_p^2$. Substituting this and the strain-velocity relationship into the stress equation yields:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = (\\rho c_p^2) \\left(-\\frac{1}{c_p} v_n\\right) = -\\rho c_p v_n\n$$\nThis equation relates the stress required to sustain a P-wave to the particle velocity. The term $\\rho c_p$ is the mechanical impedance for P-waves.\nThe boundary condition at the artificial boundary must replicate this stress. The traction normal to the boundary is $t_n = \\sigma_{11}$. So, $t_n = -\\rho c_p v_n$.\nThe problem defines the boundary force as $F_n = c_n v_n$. This force, applied by the dashpot to the nodes of the finite element mesh, must counteract the traction from the internal medium. If the traction on the boundary face is $t_n$, the force exerted by the continuum on the area $A$ is $t_n A$. To absorb the wave, the dashpot must apply an equal and opposite force, $F_n = -t_n A$.\n$$\nF_n = -(-\\rho c_p v_n) A = (\\rho c_p A) v_n\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $F_n = c_n v_n$, we identify the normal dashpot coefficient:\n$$\nc_n = \\rho c_p A\n$$\n\n**2. Shear (S) Wave at Normal Incidence**\n\nConsider a plane S-wave propagating in the positive $x_1$-direction, polarized in the $x_2$-direction. The displacement field is $\\mathbf{u} = (0, u_2, 0)$, where $u_2$ is a function of $(x_1, t)$. For a wave traveling in the $+x_1$ direction with speed $c_s$:\n$$\nu_2(x_1, t) = g(t - \\frac{x_1}{c_s})\n$$\nThe particle velocity in the tangential direction, $v_t = v_2$, is:\n$$\nv_t = \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial t} = g'(t - \\frac{x_1}{c_s})\n$$\nThe only non-zero strain component is the shear strain $\\epsilon_{12}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{1}{2} g'(t - \\frac{x_1}{c_s}) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{c_s}\\right)\n$$\nThis gives the relationship for the spatial derivative of displacement:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_1} = -\\frac{1}{c_s} \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{c_s} v_t\n$$\nAccording to Hooke's law, the shear stress $\\sigma_{12}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{12} = 2\\mu \\epsilon_{12} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_1}\n$$\nThe shear wave speed $c_s$ is defined as $c_s = \\sqrt{\\mu/\\rho}$, which gives $\\mu = \\rho c_s^2$. Substituting this and the displacement-velocity relationship into the stress equation yields:\n$$\n\\sigma_{12} = (\\rho c_s^2) \\left(-\\frac{1}{c_s} v_t\\right) = -\\rho c_s v_t\n$$\nThe term $\\rho c_s$ is the mechanical impedance for S-waves. The tangential traction on the boundary is $t_t = \\sigma_{12}$. So, $t_t = -\\rho c_s v_t$.\nThe tangential boundary force is defined as $F_t = c_t v_t$. Following the same logic as for the P-wave, this force must be $F_t = -t_t A$.\n$$\nF_t = -(-\\rho c_s v_t) A = (\\rho c_s A) v_t\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $F_t = c_t v_t$, we identify the tangential dashpot coefficient:\n$$\nc_t = \\rho c_s A\n$$\nAn identical result would be obtained for an S-wave polarized in the $x_3$-direction. Thus, the derived coefficient applies to any tangential motion.\n\n**Discussion on Validity Limits**\n\nThe derived viscous dashpot coefficients, often called Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer dashpots, provide a \"local\" absorbing boundary condition. They relate the stress at a point on the boundary to the velocity at that same point in time and space. While simple and computationally inexpensive, their effectiveness is limited by the assumptions made in the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental assumption is that all outgoing energy approaches the artificial boundary as **plane waves at normal incidence**. Any deviation from this condition leads to spurious reflections.\n\n1.  **Angle of Incidence**: The derived impedance terms $\\rho c_p$ and $\\rho c_s$ are correct only for waves whose propagation vector is normal to the boundary (angle of incidence $\\theta=0$ radians). For a plane wave arriving at an angle $\\theta > 0$, the relationship between tractions and velocities at the boundary becomes more complex. An obliquely incident P-wave, for instance, generates both reflected P- and S-waves (mode conversion), and the simple velocity-proportional boundary condition cannot correctly absorb both. The efficiency of these dashpots decreases as the angle of incidence increases. They are generally considered reasonably effective for angles up to approximately $\\pi/6$ radians ($30$ degrees) but perform poorly for larger angles, especially near grazing incidence ($\\theta \\to \\pi/2$ radians).\n2.  **Frequency Content**: The derived boundary condition is local in time (i.e., non-convolutional), which means the coefficients $c_n$ and $c_t$ are independent of frequency $\\omega$. This is an advantage in time-domain analysis as it makes implementation straightforward. In theory, they absorb normally incident plane waves perfectly across all frequencies. However, the problem of wave front curvature is frequency-dependent.\n3.  **Wavefront Curvature (Source Proximity)**: The plane wave assumption is only valid for sources located far from the artificial boundary. Sources within the finite element domain generate curved wavefronts (e.g., cylindrical or spherical). A curved wavefront can be viewed as a superposition of plane waves traveling in a spectrum of directions. Therefore, except for the single ray path normal to the boundary, all other energy will strike the boundary at an oblique angle, violating the core assumption. This effect is more pronounced for low frequencies (long wavelengths) relative to the source-boundary distance. As a rule-of-thumb, the boundary should be placed many wavelengths away from significant sources of radiation for the plane-wave approximation to be acceptable.\n4.  **Surface Waves**: These dashpots are particularly ineffective at absorbing surface waves (e.g., Rayleigh waves). A Rayleigh wave propagates along the free surface, parallel to the boundary, and involves coupled horizontal and vertical motion that decays with depth. The viscous boundary cannot absorb it because it is designed for body waves propagating into the boundary, not waves travelling along it.\n\nIn summary, the accuracy of these local dashpot coefficients is contingent upon the outgoing wavefield being dominated by body waves (P and S) at near-normal incidence. Their performance degrades significantly with increasing angle of incidence and for non-planar wavefronts originating from nearby sources.\n\nThe units of the dashpot coefficients $c_n$ and $c_t$ are force divided by velocity, which in the SI system is Newtons divided by meters per second, or $\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}/\\text{m}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} c_n \\\\ c_t \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho c_p A \\\\ \\rho c_s A \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3533144"}, {"introduction": "A key measure of any infinite element's performance is the amount of spurious wave energy it reflects back into the computational domain.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and wave propagation, is well-posed, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the reflection coefficient for a one-dimensional elastic bar terminated by an infinite element. The derivation must start from first principles.\n\nThe first principle is the balance of linear momentum in one dimension, given as:\n$$ \\rho \\, \\ddot{u}(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma(x,t)}{\\partial x} $$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the mass density, $u(x,t)$ is the axial displacement, and $\\sigma(x,t)$ is the axial stress. A dot denotes differentiation with respect to time $t$, and $\\partial_x$ denotes differentiation with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$.\n\nThe second principle is the constitutive relation for linear elasticity (Hooke's law):\n$$ \\sigma(x,t) = E \\, \\frac{\\partial u(x,t)}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus.\n\nCombining these two equations for a homogeneous medium where $E$ and $\\rho$ are constant yields the one-dimensional wave equation:\n$$ \\rho \\, \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = E \\, \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ is the elastic wave speed.\n\nWe assume time-harmonic motion, where physical quantities vary sinusoidally in time with an angular frequency $\\omega$. Using the complex exponential convention, the displacement is written as $u(x,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{u}(x) e^{i \\omega t}\\}$, where $\\hat{u}(x)$ is the complex displacement amplitude. The time derivatives are $\\ddot{u}(x,t) = \\Re\\{-\\omega^2 \\hat{u}(x) e^{i \\omega t}\\}$. Substituting this into the wave equation gives the time-independent Helmholtz equation for $\\hat{u}(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\hat{u}}{dx^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} \\hat{u}(x) = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2 \\hat{u}}{dx^2} + k^2 \\hat{u}(x) = 0 $$\nwhere $k = \\omega/c = \\omega \\sqrt{\\rho/E}$ is the wave number.\n\nThe problem specifies a general solution in the form of plane waves:\n$$ \\hat{u}(x) = U_I e^{ikx} + U_R e^{-ikx} $$\nWith the time factor $e^{i\\omega t}$, the term $U_I e^{i(kx+\\omega t)}$ represents a wave traveling in the negative $x$ direction (incident), and the term $U_R e^{i(-kx+\\omega t)}$ represents a wave traveling in the positive $x$ direction (reflected). This implies the semi-infinite bar occupies the domain $x \\geq 0$, and the boundary is at $x=0$.\n\nWe must enforce continuity and force equilibrium at the boundary $x=0$. The displacement amplitude at the boundary is:\n$$ \\hat{u}(0) = U_I e^0 + U_R e^0 = U_I + U_R $$\n\nThe stress amplitude is derived from the displacement:\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}(x) = E \\, \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dx} = E (ik U_I e^{ikx} - ik U_R e^{-ikx}) $$\nAt the boundary $x=0$, the stress amplitude is:\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}(0) = ikE(U_I - U_R) $$\n\nThe force exerted by the bar on an external element at $x=0$ is given by the stress and area, $A$. For a domain $x \\ge 0$, the outward normal at $x=0$ points in the $-x$ direction. The traction force is $T = -A\\hat{\\sigma}(0)$. The force $F$ in the boundary condition is the external force applied by the infinite element *on the bar*. By Newton's third law, this force balances the internal force from the bar, so $F = A\\hat{\\sigma}(0)$.\n\nThe infinite element is modeled by the radiation boundary condition:\n$$ F = i \\omega Z_{ie} \\hat{u}(0) $$\nwhere $Z_{ie}$ is the mechanical impedance of the infinite element.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the boundary force $F$:\n$$ A \\hat{\\sigma}(0) = i \\omega Z_{ie} \\hat{u}(0) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\hat{\\sigma}(0)$ and $\\hat{u}(0)$:\n$$ A [ikE(U_I - U_R)] = i \\omega Z_{ie} (U_I + U_R) $$\nThe imaginary unit $i$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ AkE(U_I - U_R) = \\omega Z_{ie} (U_I + U_R) $$\nSince $k = \\omega/c = \\omega\\sqrt{\\rho/E}$, we substitute for $k$:\n$$ A \\left(\\omega\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{E}}\\right) E(U_I - U_R) = \\omega Z_{ie} (U_I + U_R) $$\nThe angular frequency $\\omega$ cancels, confirming the frequency-independence of the reflection for this model:\n$$ A \\sqrt{\\rho E} (U_I - U_R) = Z_{ie} (U_I + U_R) $$\nWe identify the term $Z_{int} = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}$ as the characteristic mechanical impedance of the interior medium (the bar).

Let $z = \\sqrt{E\\rho}$ be the specific impedance. Then $R = (z_{int} - z_{ie})/(z_{int} + z_{ie})$. The measure of spurious reflection is the magnitude $|R|$. Since all material parameters are real and non-negative, $z_{int}$ and $z_{ie}$ are real, and thus $R$ is real. The magnitude is $|R| = |(z_{int} - z_{ie})/(z_{int} + z_{ie})|$.\n\nNow we analyze the specific boundary types:\n1.  **Impedance-matched infinite element**: For this case, $E_{ie} = E$ and $\\rho_{ie} = \\rho$. This implies $z_{ie} = \\sqrt{E_{ie}\\rho_{ie}} = \\sqrt{E\\rho} = z_{int}$. The reflection coefficient is $R = (z_{int} - z_{int})/(z_{int} + z_{int}) = 0$. The magnitude is $|R|=0$, indicating perfect transmission, which passes the patch test.\n\n2.  **Fixed boundary**: This condition is $\\hat{u}(0)=0$. From $\\hat{u}(0) = U_I + U_R$, we get $U_I + U_R = 0$, so $U_R = -U_I$ and $R=-1$. The magnitude is $|R|=1$. In the impedance formulation, a fixed boundary has infinite impedance, $Z_{ie} \\to \\infty$. In this limit, $R = \\lim_{Z_{ie} \\to \\infty} \\frac{Z_{int} - Z_{ie}}{Z_{int} + Z_{ie}} = \\lim_{Z_{ie} \\to \\infty} \\frac{Z_{int}/Z_{ie} - 1}{Z_{int}/Z_{ie} + 1} = -1$. The magnitude is $|-1|=1$.\n\n3.  **Free boundary**: This condition is zero force, $F=0$. This implies $\\hat{\\sigma}(0) = 0$. From $\\hat{\\sigma}(0)=ikE(U_I - U_R)$, we get $U_I - U_R = 0$, so $U_R = U_I$ and $R=1$. The magnitude is $|R|=1$. In the impedance formulation, a free boundary has zero impedance, $Z_{ie} = 0$. In this case, $R = \\frac{Z_{int} - 0}{Z_{int} + 0} = 1$.

The goal is to verify second-order convergence of an infinite element scheme by computing the observed order of convergence from first principles and reporting it for a small test suite. All physical quantities must be treated in the International System of Units (SI). The final outputs are dimensionless and must be printed as a single line containing a comma-separated list of floats enclosed in square brackets.\n\nConsider a straight bar occupying the semi-infinite domain $x \\in [0,\\infty)$ with constant Young’s modulus $E$, cross-sectional area $A$, and mass density $\\rho$. Let $u(x,t)$ denote the longitudinal displacement. The governing equation is the one-dimensional elastodynamic wave equation derived from Newton’s second law and Hooke’s law,\n$$\n\\rho A \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(EA \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,\\infty), \\; t \\ge 0.\n$$\nAssume a time-harmonic steady-state solution of the form $u(x,t) = \\Re\\{U(x) e^{-i \\omega t}\\}$, where $\\omega$ is the circular frequency and $U(x)$ is a complex-valued amplitude. Substitution yields the frequency-domain boundary value problem\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(EA \\frac{dU}{dx}\\right) + \\rho A \\omega^2 U = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,\\infty).\n$$\nAt the driven end $x=0$, a prescribed traction (stress resultant) of amplitude $\\sigma_0 A$ is applied, where $\\sigma_0$ is the stress amplitude:\n$$\nEA \\frac{dU}{dx}(0) = \\sigma_0 A.\n$$\nTo model radiation into the unbounded medium at $x \\to \\infty$, impose the one-way (Sommerfeld) radiation condition that only outgoing waves exist. For the one-dimensional bar, this is exactly represented at any truncation location $x=L$ by the impedance (Robin) boundary condition\n$$\nEA \\frac{dU}{dx}(L) = i k EA \\, U(L), \\quad k = \\frac{\\omega}{c}, \\quad c = \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\rho}},\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the wave speed and $k$ is the wavenumber. This Robin condition is the exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the semi-infinite continuation and constitutes an exact infinite element representation in one dimension.\n\nThe exact solution for the semi-infinite problem with traction at $x=0$ and radiation to $\\infty$ is the outgoing wave\n$$\nU_{\\text{exact}}(x) = U_0 e^{i k x}, \\quad U_0 = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{i k E}.\n$$\n\nVerification target. Discretize the finite interval $[0,L]$ with standard two-node linear finite elements to approximate $U(x)$ for a given $\\omega$, enforcing the exact radiation boundary at $x=L$ via the Robin condition above. The discrete algebraic system in the frequency domain is\n$$\n\\left(\\mathbf{K} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{M} + i k EA \\, \\mathbf{R}\\right)\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{f},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{K}$ is the assembled stiffness matrix with entries $K_{ij} = \\int_0^L E A \\, N_i' N_j' \\, dx$, $\\mathbf{M}$ is the consistent mass matrix with entries $M_{ij} = \\int_0^L \\rho A \\, N_i N_j \\, dx$, $\\mathbf{R}$ adds a contribution only at the last node to enforce the Robin term, and $\\mathbf{f}$ is the load vector induced by the traction at $x=0$ with $f_1 = \\sigma_0 A$ (all other components zero). Here $N_i$ are the standard linear shape functions. This setup represents an infinite element scheme where the unbounded domain effect is captured exactly at $x=L$.\n\nDefine the relative $L^2$-norm error over $[0,L]$ as\n$$\n\\varepsilon(h) = \\frac{\\left(\\int_0^L \\left|U_h(x) - U_{\\text{exact}}(x)\\right|^2 dx\\right)^{1/2}}{\\left(\\int_0^L \\left|U_{\\text{exact}}(x)\\right|^2 dx\\right)^{1/2}},\n$$\nwhere $U_h$ is the piecewise-linear finite element approximation and $h$ is the uniform element size. Using $|U_{\\text{exact}}(x)| = |U_0|$ for all $x$, the denominator simplifies to $|U_0| \\sqrt{L}$. For three successive uniform meshes with $h_1 > h_2 > h_3$ (e.g., halving $h$ each refinement), the observed order of convergence is computed as\n$$\np_{12} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\varepsilon(h_1)/\\varepsilon(h_2)\\right)}{\\ln\\left(h_1/h_2\\right)}, \\quad\np_{23} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\varepsilon(h_2)/\\varepsilon(h_3)\\right)}{\\ln\\left(h_2/h_3)\\right)}, \\quad\np_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{p_{12} + p_{23}}{2}.\n$$\nSecond-order convergence of the infinite element scheme is confirmed if $p_{\\text{avg}}$ is close to $2$; a practical quantitative metric is that $p_{\\text{avg}} \\ge 1.8$.\n\nNumerical and physical setup.

Choose the truncation length $L$ as an integer multiple of the wavelength to avoid artificial bias:\n- Test case $1$ (happy path): $f = 50$ Hz, $L = 2\\lambda$, meshes with $N \\in \\{40, 80, 160\\}$ elements.\n- Test case $2$ (low-frequency edge): $f = 5$ Hz, $L = 1\\lambda$, meshes with $N \\in \\{20, 40, 80\\}$ elements.\n- Test case $3$ (higher-frequency edge): $f = 200$ Hz, $L = 1\\lambda$, meshes with $N \\in \\{80, 160, 320\\}$ elements.\n\nAngle unit specification. All occurrences of angular frequency and wavenumber are in radians, and the exponential $e^{i k x}$ uses radians for the argument.\n\nFinal output format. Your program must print a single line containing a list of three floats corresponding to $p_{\\text{avg}}$ for test cases $1$, $2$, and $3$, in that order, with no additional text.

The physical system is a semi-infinite elastic bar subjected to time-harmonic traction at one end. The verification will confirm the scheme's theoretical second-order convergence rate by computing the observed order of convergence from the results of a finite element simulation.\n\nThe physical problem is governed by the one-dimensional elastodynamic wave equation. Assuming a steady-state time-harmonic displacement field of the form $u(x,t) = \\Re\\{U(x) e^{-i \\omega t}\\}$, where $U(x)$ is the complex amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, the governing equation transforms into a second-order ordinary differential equation in the frequency domain:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(EA \\frac{dU}{dx}\\right) + \\rho A \\omega^2 U = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,\\infty).\n$$\nHere, $E$ is Young's modulus, $\\rho$ is the mass density, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area, all assumed constant.\n\nThe boundary conditions are a prescribed traction at the accessible end ($x=0$) and a radiation condition for waves propagating towards infinity. The traction condition is given by:\n$$\nEA \\frac{dU}{dx}(0) = \\sigma_0 A,\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_0$ is the applied stress amplitude. The radiation condition, ensuring only outgoing waves exist, can be exactly represented at any finite truncation point $x=L$ by a Robin boundary condition, which serves as an exact one-dimensional infinite element:\n$$\nEA \\frac{dU}{dx}(L) = i k EA \\, U(L).\n$$\nIn this expression, $k = \\omega/c$ is the wavenumber and $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ is the elastic wave speed. For this boundary value problem, the exact analytical solution for the displacement amplitude is an outgoing plane wave:\n$$\nU_{\\text{exact}}(x) = U_0 e^{i k x}, \\quad \\text{with } U_0 = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{i k E}.\n$$\nThis exact solution provides the benchmark against which our numerical approximation will be verified.\n\nThe numerical solution is obtained using the Finite Element Method (FEM) on the truncated domain $[0,L]$. The domain is discretized into $N$ uniform two-node linear finite elements of size $h = L/N$. The unknown complex amplitude function $U(x)$ is approximated as a piecewise linear function $U_h(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} U_j N_j(x)$, where $U_j$ are the unknown nodal displacement amplitudes and $N_j(x)$ are the standard linear \"hat\" basis functions.\n\nApplying the Galerkin method leads to a system of linear algebraic equations. For a generic element $e$ spanning $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, the element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{k}^e$ and consistent mass matrix $\\mathbf{m}^e$ are derived from the weak form integrals:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}^e_{ab} = \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} EA N_a' N_b' \\, dx = \\frac{EA}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{m}^e_{ab} = \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} \\rho A N_a N_b \\, dx = \\frac{\\rho A h}{6} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAssembling these element matrices over all $N$ elements yields the global stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ and mass matrix $\\mathbf{M}$. The traction at $x=0$ contributes to the force vector $\\mathbf{f}$, where the only non-zero component is $f_1 = \\sigma_0 A$. The Robin boundary condition at $x=L$ introduces a complex impedance term. This is incorporated by defining a matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ with a single non-zero entry, $R_{N+1, N+1}=1$, which modifies the last diagonal entry of the system matrix. The final discretized system is:\n$$\n\\left(\\mathbf{K} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{M} + i k EA \\, \\mathbf{R}\\right)\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{f},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the vector of complex nodal displacements $\\{U_j\\}$. This complex-valued linear system is solved for $\\mathbf{u}$.\n\nThe convergence of the numerical solution $U_h(x)$ to the exact solution $U_{\\text{exact}}(x)$ is quantified using the relative $L^2$-norm error over the domain $[0,L]$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(h) = \\frac{\\|U_h - U_{\\text{exact}}\\|_{L^2([0,L])}}{\\|U_{\\text{exact}}\\|_{L^2([0,L])}} = \\frac{\\left(\\int_0^L \\left|U_h(x) - U_{\\text{exact}}(x)\\right|^2 dx\\right)^{1/2}}{|U_0|\\sqrt{L}}.\n$$\nThe integral in the numerator is computed numerically. Since the integrand, $|U_h(x) - U_{\\text{exact}}(x)|^2$, is not a polynomial, \"exact\" quadrature is not possible. However, for a convergence study, it is critical that the quadrature error is negligible compared to the discretization error. This is achieved by using a high-order Gaussian quadrature rule on each element. A 4-point rule is sufficient for this purpose.\n\nFor a method with convergence order $p$, the error behaves as $\\varepsilon(h) \\propto h^p$. By computing the error for a sequence of refined meshes, say with element sizes $h_1$ and $h_2$, the observed order of convergence $p$ can be estimated as:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\ln(\\varepsilon(h_1)/\\varepsilon(h_2))}{\\ln(h_1/h_2)}.\n$$\nThe verification study involves computing this value for three successive mesh refinements ($h_1 > h_2 > h_3$ where $h_1/h_2 = h_2/h_3 = 2$) and calculating the average, $p_{\\text{avg}}$, for each test case specified. Second-order convergence is expected for linear elements, so we anticipate $p_{\\text{avg}} \\approx 2$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. For each test case defined by frequency $f$ and mesh resolutions $N$:\n2. Calculate the dependent physical parameters: $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$, $k = \\omega/c$, $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$, and the domain length $L$.\n3. For each mesh resolution $N$ in the test case:\n    a. Construct the global stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ and mass matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ by assembling element-level contributions.\n    b. Form the complex system matrix $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{K} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{M}$, then add the radiation boundary term $i k EA$ to the last diagonal element.\n    c. Form the load vector $\\mathbf{f}$ with $f_1 = \\sigma_0 A$.\n    d. Solve the linear system $\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{f}$ for the nodal displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}$.\n    e. Calculate the relative $L^2$ error $\\varepsilon(h)$ by numerically integrating the squared error magnitude over each element using 4-point Gaussian quadrature.\n4. Using the three computed errors, calculate $p_{12}$, $p_{23}$, and their average $p_{\\text{avg}}$.\n5.
