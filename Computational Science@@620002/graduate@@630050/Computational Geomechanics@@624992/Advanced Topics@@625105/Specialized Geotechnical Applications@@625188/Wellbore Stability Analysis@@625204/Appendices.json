Calculation of Purely Elastic Hoop Effective Stress ($\\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{e}}$)**\n\nFor a circular opening in an infinite, isotropic, elastic medium under an isotropic far-field total stress $S_0$ and an internal pressure $P_w$, the total stresses in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$ are given by the Kirsch equations. Due to axisymmetry ($S_H = S_h = S_0$), the shear stress $\\tau_{r\\theta}$ is zero and the stresses are independent of $\\theta$. The radial ($\\sigma_r$) and hoop ($\\sigma_\\theta$) total stresses are:\n$$ \\sigma_r(r) = S_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right) + P_w \\frac{a^2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = S_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right) - P_w \\frac{a^2}{r^2} $$\nWe are interested in the stress at the borehole wall, where $r=a$:\n$$ \\sigma_r(r=a) = S_0 (1-1) + P_w (1) = P_w $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r=a) = S_0 (1+1) - P_w (1) = 2S_0 - P_w $$\nSubstituting the given total stress values $S_0 = 60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $P_w = 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$:\n$$ \\sigma_r(r=a) = 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r=a) = 2(60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) - 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 110\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe effective stress, $\\sigma'$, is related to the total stress, $\\sigma$, and pore pressure, $P$, by Terzaghi's principle, generalized by Biot: $\\sigma' = \\sigma - \\alpha P$. The problem states that due to steady-state drained conditions, the pore pressure at the wall is equal to the mud pressure, $P(r=a) = P_w = 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. With $\\alpha=1$, the effective stresses at the wall are:\n$$ \\sigma'_{rr, \\text{e}}(r=a) = \\sigma_r(r=a) - \\alpha P(r=a) = 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 1(10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) = 0\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{e}}(r=a) = \\sigma_\\theta(r=a) - \\alpha P(r=a) = 110\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 1(10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThus, the purely elastic hoop effective stress at the borehole wall is $\\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{e}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Elastic-Plastic Hoop Effective Stress ($\\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{ep}}$)**\n\nFirst, we must verify that the elastic stress state causes the rock to yield. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, in terms of maximum ($\\sigma'_1$) and minimum ($\\sigma'_3$) principal effective stresses, is:\n$$ \\sigma'_1 = \\sigma'_3 N_\\varphi + C_0 $$\nwhere $N_\\varphi = \\frac{1+\\sin\\varphi}{1-\\sin\\varphi}$ and $C_0 = \\frac{2c \\cos\\varphi}{1-\\sin\\varphi}$.\nFrom the problem givens: $c = 8\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\varphi = 30^{\\circ}$, so $\\sin\\varphi = 0.5$ and $\\cos\\varphi = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n$$ N_\\varphi = \\frac{1+0.5}{1-0.5} = \\frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3 $$\n$$ C_0 = \\frac{2(8\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\cos(30^{\\circ})}{1-\\sin(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{16 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)}{1-0.5} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{0.5}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 16\\sqrt{3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe problem assumes $\\sigma'_\\theta$ is the maximum principal stress ($\\sigma'_1$) and $\\sigma'_r$ is the minimum ($\\sigma'_3$). From the elastic calculation, at the wall, $\\sigma'_1 = \\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{e}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\sigma'_3 = \\sigma'_{rr, \\text{e}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nLet's check if the yield condition is met:\n$$ \\sigma'_3 N_\\varphi + C_0 = (0)(3) + 16\\sqrt{3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 27.71\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nSince $\\sigma'_1 = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa} > 16\\sqrt{3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, the rock at the borehole wall has yielded, and a plastic zone has formed.\n\nWhen the material yields, its stress state must lie on the failure envelope. Therefore, the actual hoop effective stress at the wall, $\\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{ep}}$, cannot be the elastically calculated $100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. Instead, it is the stress that satisfies the Mohr-Coulomb criterion given the known radial stress condition at the wall.\nThe radial effective stress at the wall is fixed by the mud pressure and pore pressure boundary condition:\n$$ \\sigma'_3 = \\sigma'_{rr}(r=a) = P_w - \\alpha P_w = 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 1(10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) = 0\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe hoop effective stress at the wall, $\\sigma'_1 = \\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{ep}}$, is then determined by the yield criterion:\n$$ \\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{ep}} = \\sigma'_3 N_\\varphi + C_0 = (0)(3) + 16\\sqrt{3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{ep}} = 16\\sqrt{3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThis is the updated hoop effective stress at the wall in the elastic-plastic solution.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Ratio $R$**\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as the updated elastic-plastic wall hoop effective stress to the purely elastic wall hoop effective stress.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{ep}}}{\\sigma'_{\\theta\\theta, \\text{e}}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ R = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{100} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$ R = \\frac{16 \\times 1.7320508...}{100} = \\frac{27.7128129...}{100} = 0.277128129... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ R \\approx 0.2771 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2771}$$", "id": "3571622"}, {"introduction": "The mechanical response of rock is intimately coupled with the behavior of the fluids within its pores, making wellbore stability a time-dependent, poroelastic problem.

Derivation of the Governing Equation and Characteristic Timescale**\n\nThe derivation starts from the principle of local mass conservation for a single-phase fluid saturating a porous medium. The governing equation for mass balance in a control volume is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\phi \\rho_f) + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho_f \\mathbf{v}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the porosity, $\\rho_f$ is the fluid density, and $\\mathbf{v}$ is the Darcy velocity vector.\n\nThe first term, representing the rate of change of fluid mass per unit volume, can be expressed in terms of the pore pressure, $p$. The problem defines the specific storage, $S_s$, as the volume of fluid released from storage per unit volume of porous material per unit decline in pore pressure. This definition encapsulates the combined effects of fluid compressibility and pore volume compressibility. Mathematically, it relates the change in fluid mass content to the change in pore pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\phi \\rho_f) = \\rho_f S_s \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe second term involves the Darcy velocity, $\\mathbf{v}$, which is given by Darcy's law. For a homogeneous and isotropic medium, neglecting gravitational effects (as the flow is primarily radial and driven by pressure gradients), Darcy's law is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla p\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the formation permeability and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nSubstituting these two expressions into the mass conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\rho_f S_s \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\rho_f \\left( -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla p \\right) \\right) = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\rho_f S_s \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\rho_f \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla p \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a \"slightly compressible\" fluid, which implies that the fluid density $\\rho_f$ is a weak function of pressure. This allows for a critical linearization: we can treat $\\rho_f$ as approximately constant with respect to spatial variations, moving it outside the divergence operator. This is valid for the small pressure perturbations assumed. The material properties $k$, $\\mu$, and $S_s$ are also assumed to be homogeneous (spatially constant). The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho_f S_s \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\rho_f \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla p)\n$$\nDividing by $\\rho_f$ and using the identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla p) \\equiv \\nabla^2 p$ (the Laplacian of $p$), we arrive at the linear diffusion equation for pore pressure:\n$$\nS_s \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla^2 p\n$$\nThis is typically written in the standard form of a diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\left( \\frac{k}{\\mu S_s} \\right) \\nabla^2 p\n$$\nBy comparing this to the generic diffusion equation, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c \\nabla^2 u$, we identify the hydraulic diffusivity, $c$, as:\n$$\nc = \\frac{k}{\\mu S_s}\n$$\nTo find the characteristic hydraulic diffusion timescale, $t_c$, we use dimensional reasoning.
