The material follows small-strain, linear elasticity up to yield with Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$, and beyond yield it follows an elastic-perfectly plastic Mohr–Coulomb model (Mohr–Coulomb) with zero friction angle $\\phi=0$ (purely cohesive response). There are no body forces. The lateral faces are traction-free. The bottom face is fixed. The top face is subjected to a uniform prescribed vertical displacement $u_0$ downward. Assume Saint-Venant’s principle applies so that the interior stress state may be treated as uniform under these boundary conditions.\n\nConsider two distinct cohesion fields:\n- Field A: $c_A(x,y) \\equiv 0.50 \\,\\text{MPa}$, constant over the domain.\n- Field B: $c_B(x,y) = 0.20 \\,\\text{MPa} + 0.05 \\,\\text{MPa}\\,\\cos\\!\\left(\\pi y/H\\right)$, varying with $y$ and independent of $x$.\n\nThe elastic constants and geometry are\n$E=1.00\\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\nu=0.30$, $H=1.00\\,\\text{m}$, $W=1.00\\,\\text{m}$, and the imposed displacement is $u_0=1.00\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nUsing only fundamental kinematics of small strain, the constitutive relation of linear elasticity, the definition of traction, and the fact that elastic-perfectly plastic behavior reduces to purely elastic evolution whenever the stress state lies strictly inside the yield domain, do the following:\n\n1.

Compute the total vertical reaction force $F$ on the top boundary in Newtons. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in Newtons.", "solution": "The solution proceeds in four parts as requested.\n\n1. Derivation of the interior stress state and the vertical stress component $\\sigma_{yy}$.\n\nThe problem states that the interior stress state may be treated as uniform. A uniform stress field $\\sigma_{ij}$ (where $\\sigma_{ij}$ are constants) automatically satisfies the equilibrium equation in the absence of body forces, $\\partial_j \\sigma_{ij} = 0$.\n\nThe boundary conditions on the lateral faces (at $x=0$ and $x=W$) are that they are traction-free. The traction vector on a surface with outward normal $\\mathbf{n}$ is given by $\\mathbf{T} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$.\nFor the face at $x=W$, the normal is $\\mathbf{n} = (1, 0, 0)$. The traction components are:\n$T_x = \\sigma_{xx} n_x = \\sigma_{xx}$\n$T_y = \\sigma_{yx} n_x = \\sigma_{yx}$\n$T_z = \\sigma_{zx} n_x = \\sigma_{zx}$\nSince the face is traction-free, $\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{0}$, which implies $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yx} = \\sigma_{zx} = 0$.\nA similar analysis on the traction-free front and back faces (in the $z$-direction, with normals $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,\\pm 1)$) yields $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{yz} = \\sigma_{xz} = 0$.\nDue to the symmetry of the stress tensor, $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$, we have $\\sigma_{xy} = \\sigma_{yx} = 0$, $\\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{zx} = 0$, and $\\sigma_{yz} = \\sigma_{zy} = 0$.\nThe only potentially non-zero stress component is $\\sigma_{yy}$. The stress tensor is therefore uniaxial:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{yy} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe specimen is subjected to a uniform vertical displacement $u_y = -u_0$ at the top face $y=H$, while the bottom face $y=0$ is fixed, meaning $u_y=0$. The assumption of a uniform stress state implies a uniform strain state. The vertical strain $\\varepsilon_{yy}$ is defined from the small-strain kinematics as $\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_0}$.\nThe change in height is $\\Delta L = u_y(H) - u_y(0) = -u_0 - 0 = -u_0$. The original height is $L_0 = H$.\nThus, the uniform vertical strain is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy} = -\\frac{u_0}{H}\n$$\nThe material behavior is initially linear elastic. The constitutive relation (Hooke's Law) for an isotropic elastic material under uniaxial stress simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = E \\varepsilon_{yy}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\varepsilon_{yy}$, we obtain the expression for the vertical stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = E \\!\\left(-\\frac{u_0}{H}\\right) = -\\frac{E u_0}{H}\n$$\nThis stress is uniform throughout the specimen, consistent with the initial assumption.\n\n2. Verification that the stress state is elastic for both cohesion fields.\n\nThe material yields according to the Mohr–Coulomb criterion. With a friction angle $\\phi=0$, the yield function simplifies to the Tresca criterion, where yield occurs if the maximum shear stress $\\tau_{max}$ reaches the cohesion $c$. The condition for the material to remain strictly in the elastic domain is:\n$$\n\\tau_{max} < c\n$$\nThe maximum shear stress is given by $\\tau_{max} = \\frac{\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_3$ are the maximum and minimum principal stresses, respectively.\nFor the uniaxial stress state derived above, the non-zero stress is $\\sigma_{yy}$. We compute its value using the given parameters: $E=1.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{Pa}$, $u_0=1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$, and $H=1.00\\,\\text{m}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = -\\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{Pa})(1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m})}{1.00\\,\\text{m}} = -1.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{Pa} = -0.100\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe stress is compressive as expected. The principal stresses are the eigenvalues of the stress tensor. For the diagonal stress tensor we found, the principal stresses are simply the diagonal entries: $\\{\\sigma_{yy}, 0, 0\\}$.\nOrdering them, we have $\\sigma_1 = 0$, $\\sigma_2 = 0$, and $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_{yy} = -0.100\\,\\text{MPa}$.\nThe maximum shear stress is therefore:\n$$\n\\tau_{max} = \\frac{\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3}{2} = \\frac{0 - (-0.100\\,\\text{MPa})}{2} = 0.050\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nNow we must check this value against the cohesion for each field.\n- Field A: The cohesion is constant, $c_A(x,y) = 0.50\\,\\text{MPa}$. The elasticity condition is $\\tau_{max} < c_A$, which is $0.050\\,\\text{MPa} < 0.50\\,\\text{MPa}$. This inequality is true. Therefore, for cohesion Field A, the specimen remains strictly elastic.\n- Field B: The cohesion varies with depth, $c_B(x,y) = 0.20\\,\\text{MPa} + 0.05\\,\\text{MPa}\\,\\cos(\\pi y/H)$. To ensure the entire specimen remains elastic, the maximum shear stress must be less than the minimum value of cohesion anywhere in the domain. The minimum value of $c_B$ occurs when $\\cos(\\pi y/H)$ is at its minimum, which is $-1$. This happens at $y=H$.\n$$\nc_{B, \\text{min}} = 0.20\\,\\text{MPa} + 0.05\\,\\text{MPa}\\,(-1) = 0.15\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe elasticity condition is $\\tau_{max} < c_{B, \\text{min}}$, which is $0.050\\,\\text{MPa} < 0.15\\,\\text{MPa}$. This inequality is also true. Therefore, for cohesion Field B, the specimen also remains strictly elastic throughout its domain.\n\n3. Conclusion on boundary tractions and non-uniqueness.\n\nThe boundary traction vector on the top face ($y=H$) is given by $\\mathbf{T} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$, where the outward normal from the specimen is $\\mathbf{n}=(0, 1, 0)$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{yy} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\sigma_{yy} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe traction field is uniform and has only a vertical component $T_y = \\sigma_{yy} = -0.100\\,\\text{MPa}$.\nAs we have shown, the calculation of $\\sigma_{yy}$ depends only on the elastic modulus $E$ and the applied kinematics ($u_0, H$). The result is independent of the cohesion parameter $c$. Since the material response is purely elastic for both Field A and Field B, the resulting stress state $\\sigma_{yy}$ is identical in both cases. Consequently, the boundary traction field on the top face is identical for the two cohesion fields.\n\nThe structural cause of non-uniqueness is that the prescribed loading (a small displacement $u_0$) is insufficient to induce plastic deformation. The problem of identifying the cohesion field $c(x,y)$ from measurements of boundary tractions is an inverse problem. In this case, the forward model (the relationship between material properties and observable measurements) shows that for deformations within the elastic range, the boundary tractions depend only on the elastic parameters ($E$, $\\nu$). The plastic parameters ($c$, $\\phi$) do not influence the mechanical response. Because the measurement (boundary traction) is insensitive to the parameter we wish to identify (cohesion), any cohesion field that is strong enough to prevent yielding (i.e., any $c(x,y) > \\tau_{max}$ everywhere) will produce the exact same boundary tractions. Therefore, one cannot uniquely determine the cohesion field from this experiment.\n\n4. Computation of the total vertical reaction force.\n\nThe total vertical reaction force $F$ on the top boundary is the integral of the vertical reaction traction over the area of the face. The reaction traction exerted by the specimen on the loading platen is equal and opposite to the traction exerted by the platen on the specimen. The force exerted by the specimen is directed upward (positive $y$-direction) and has a magnitude equal to $|T_y|$ integrated over the area $A = W \\times t$.\nGiven $W = 1.00\\,\\text{m}$ and unit thickness $t=1$, we assume $t = 1.00\\,\\text{m}$. The area is $A = 1.00\\,\\text{m} \\times 1.00\\,\\text{m} = 1.00\\,\\text{m}^2$.\nThe vertical traction is $T_y = \\sigma_{yy} = -1.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{Pa}$. This is the stress exerted by the material below $y=H$ on the material above. The force on the loading platen is in the opposite direction (upward).\n$$\nF = -T_y \\times A = -(\\sigma_{yy}) \\times (W \\cdot t)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nF = -(-1.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{N/m}^2) \\times (1.00\\,\\text{m} \\times 1.00\\,\\text{m}) = 1.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{N}\n$$\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nF = 1.000 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{N}\n$$\nThis force is the same for both cohesion fields, as the stress state is identical.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.000 \\times 10^{5}}\n$$", "id": "3535002"}, {"introduction": "Building on the theme of data limitations, this exercise addresses the common issue of outliers in measurement data, which can violate the assumptions of standard least-squares methods.

This is a classic problem in Bayesian parameter identification. We will use a linearized approximation around the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate, which simplifies the posterior distribution to a multivariate Gaussian. The posterior covariance matrix, which quantifies the uncertainty and correlation of the parameters, is approximated as the inverse of the Hessian of the negative log-posterior function evaluated at the MAP estimate.\n\nThe parameter vector is defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [\\lambda, \\kappa, M, p_{c0}, N]^\\top$, containing five key parameters of the Modified Cam-Clay model. The problem provides the MAP estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\star}$, and the task is to compute the posterior covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{post}}$ using the Gauss-Newton approximation for the Hessian, $\\mathbf{H}$.\n\nThe formula for the Hessian is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} \\approx \\mathbf{J}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{n}}^{-1} \\mathbf{J} + \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{pr}}^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian of the model predictions with respect to the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{n}}$ is the covariance matrix of the observation noise, and $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{pr}}$ is the covariance matrix of the Gaussian prior on the parameters.\n\nThe procedure to solve this for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Construct the Jacobian Matrix ($\\mathbf{J}$)**: The Jacobian is a matrix where each row corresponds to an observation and each column corresponds to a parameter. An entry $J_{ij}$ is the partial derivative of the $i$-th model prediction with respect to the $j$-th parameter, $\\partial f_i / \\partial \\theta_j$. The predictions $f_i$ come from two models:\n    -   A model for void ratio $e$ as a function of mean effective stress $p'$, depending on parameters $\\lambda, \\kappa, p_{c0}, N$.\n    -   A model for deviatoric stress $q$ at critical state as a function of $p'$, depending on parameter $M$.\n    \n    The problem provides the explicit formulas for these partial derivatives, which are evaluated at the MAP estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\star} = [0.2, 0.05, 1.2, 150, 2.0]^\\top$ and the given pressure values for each measurement. The Jacobian will have $m = n_e + n_q$ rows (where $n_e$ and $n_q$ are the number of void ratio and critical state measurements, respectively) and $5$ columns.\n\n2.  **Construct the Noise and Prior Covariance Matrices**:\n    -   The observation noise is assumed to be independent and Gaussian. Thus, the noise covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{n}}$ is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries are $\\sigma_e^2 = (0.02)^2$ for the $n_e$ void ratio measurements and $\\sigma_q^2 = (10)^2$ for the $n_q$ critical state measurements. Its inverse, $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{n}}^{-1}$, is also diagonal with entries $1/\\sigma_e^2$ and $1/\\sigma_q^2$.\n    -   The prior on the parameters is also Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{pr}}$. The diagonal entries are the squared prior standard deviations, $[s_\\lambda^2, s_\\kappa^2, s_M^2, s_{p_{c0}}^2, s_N^2]$, which are provided for each test case. Its inverse, $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{pr}}^{-1}$, is a diagonal matrix with entries $1/s_j^2$.\n\n3.  **Compute the Hessian ($\\mathbf{H}$)**: With $\\mathbf{J}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{n}}^{-1}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{pr}}^{-1}$ constructed, the Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ is computed using the provided formula through matrix multiplication and addition. The term $\\mathbf{J}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{n}}^{-1} \\mathbf{J}$ represents the information gained from the data (the likelihood), while $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\text{pr}}^{-1}$ represents the information from the prior.\n\n4.  **Compute the Posterior Covariance ($\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{post}}$)**: The approximate posterior covariance matrix is the inverse of the Hessian:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{post}} \\approx \\mathbf{H}^{-1}\n    $$\n    This $5 \\times 5$ matrix contains the variances of the parameters on its diagonal and the covariances as its off-diagonal elements.\n\n5.  **Extract Results**:\n    -   The posterior marginal standard deviation for each parameter $\\theta_i$ is the square root of the corresponding diagonal element of the posterior covariance matrix: $\\text{sd}_i = \\sqrt{(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{post}})_{ii}}$.\n    -   The correlation coefficient between two parameters $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$ is calculated as:\n        $$\n        \\rho(\\theta_i, \\theta_j) = \\frac{(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{post}})_{ij}}{\\sqrt{(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{post}})_{ii} (\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{post}})_{jj}}}\n        $$\n    \n    The required quantities for each test case are the five posterior standard deviations ($\\text{sd}_\\lambda$, $\\text{sd}_\\kappa$, $\\text{sd}_M$, $\\text{sd}_{p_{c0}}$, $\\text{sd}_N$) and three specific correlation coefficients ($\\rho(N,\\lambda)$, $\\rho(\\kappa,p_{c0})$, $\\rho(M,\\lambda)$).\n\nAn important insight arises from the structure of the Jacobian. The sensitivities of the void ratio $e$ to the parameter $M$ are zero. Conversely, the sensitivities of the critical state stress $q$ to parameters $\\lambda$, $\\kappa$, $p_{c0}$, and $N$ are zero. This structural separation implies that the Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ will be block-diagonal, with one block for parameter $M$ and another for the remaining four parameters. Consequently, its inverse $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\text{post}}$ will also be block-diagonal. This means that the posterior estimate for $M$ will be statistically uncorrelated with the posterior estimates of the other four parameters. Therefore, $\\rho(M,\\lambda)$ is mathematically expected to be zero for all test cases.", "answer": "[[0.007553,0.008479,0.019283,4.417246,0.040201,-0.985959,-0.638528,0.000000],[0.007553,0.008479,0.200000,4.417246,0.040201,-0.985959,-0.638528,0.000000],[0.005118,0.020000,0.019283,50.000000,0.034375,-0.998060,0.000000,0.000000]]", "id": "3534949"}]}
