This practice explores the crucial link between the Coulomb friction law, the principle of effective stress, and time-dependent pore pressure dissipation governed by consolidation theory. By deriving the change in shear strength of a saturated interface over time, you will gain a first-principles understanding of frictional strengthening, a fundamental process controlling the long-term stability of geological faults, slopes, and foundations [@problem_id:3512291].", "problem": "A planar, saturated, rough rock–soil interface of area $A$ is embedded symmetrically between identical, homogeneous, isotropic, fully saturated porous half-layers. At time $t=0^{+}$ a compressive normal load $N$ is applied uniformly to the interface and then held constant. The total normal stress at the interface is $\\sigma_{n}=N/A$ (compression taken as positive). Immediately after loading, the interface exhibits an undrained excess pore pressure $u_{0}$ that subsequently dissipates by one-dimensional consolidation in the adjacent porous layers with coefficient of consolidation $c_{v}$ and equal drainage path length $H_{d}$ to each drained boundary (double drainage). Assume small strains and quasi-static conditions.\n\nA tangential (shear) force $T$ is then applied monotonically and quasi-statically along the interface, inducing a uniform shear traction vector $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ on the interface. The interface follows a rate-independent, cohesionless Coulomb criterion written in terms of effective stress as $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| \\le \\mu\\,p'$, where $\\mu$ is the constant friction coefficient and $p'$ is the effective normal stress on the interface. The effective normal stress is defined by the principle of effective stress as $p'=\\sigma_{n}-u$, with $u$ the pore pressure at the interface.\n\nTreat the pore pressure dissipation as one-dimensional consolidation normal to the interface with zero excess pore pressure at the drained boundaries a distance $H_{d}$ away on each side, and a spatially uniform initial excess pore pressure $u(z,0)=u_{0}$ in the consolidating layers. You may assume that the pore pressure relevant for sliding at the interface equals the spatial average excess pore pressure in the consolidating layers in the sense of Terzaghi’s one-dimensional consolidation theory with double drainage.\n\nUsing only the above foundations (effective stress principle, Coulomb friction, and one-dimensional consolidation), derive a closed-form analytical expression (you may express it as a convergent series) for the time-dependent critical shear force $T_{c}(t)$ for sliding onset. Express your final $T_{c}(t)$ in Newtons. Then, based on your expression, explain qualitatively how increasing consolidation time $t$ influences the stability of the interface.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $T_{c}(t)$ in terms of $N$, $A$, $\\mu$, $u_{0}$, $c_{v}$, $H_{d}$, and $t$.

These are fundamental and well-established principles in geomechanics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($A, N, \\mu, u_0, c_v, H_d$), initial and boundary conditions, and a clear, albeit idealized, assumption regarding the relevant pore pressure for the calculation. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a standard, non-trivial synthesis of concepts in soil mechanics and does not contain any of the listed flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the time-dependent critical shear force $T_{c}(t)$ required to initiate sliding.\n\nThe critical shear force $T_{c}(t)$ is the magnitude of the tangential force $T$ that first satisfies the sliding condition. Given a uniform shear traction vector $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ over the interface area $A$, its magnitude is $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| = T/A$. The critical shear force $T_{c}(t)$ corresponds to a critical shear traction magnitude, which we denote $\\tau_{c}(t)$, such that\n$$T_{c}(t) = A \\, \\tau_{c}(t)$$\n\nThe interface behavior is governed by the cohesionless Coulomb friction criterion written in terms of effective stress. Sliding is initiated when the shear traction magnitude reaches the frictional resistance of the interface:\n$$\\tau_{c}(t) = \\mu \\, p'(t)$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the coefficient of friction and $p'(t)$ is the time-dependent effective normal stress on the interface.\n\nThe effective normal stress is defined by the principle of effective stress as:\n$$p'(t) = \\sigma_{n} - u(t)$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{n}$ is the total normal stress, which is constant and given by $\\sigma_{n} = N/A$. The term $u(t)$ is the excess pore pressure at the interface at time $t$.\n\nCombining these equations, we can express the critical shear force as:\n$$T_{c}(t) = A \\, \\mu \\, p'(t) = A \\, \\mu \\, (\\sigma_{n} - u(t)) = A \\, \\mu \\left(\\frac{N}{A} - u(t)\\right)$$\n$$T_{c}(t) = \\mu (N - A \\, u(t))$$\nTo find $T_{c}(t)$, we must determine the excess pore pressure at the interface, $u(t)$, as a function of time.\n\nThe problem states that pore pressure dissipates according to Terzaghi's theory of one-dimensional consolidation. The geometry is one of double drainage, with the interface at the center of the consolidating medium and drained boundaries at a distance $H_{d}$ on each side. The total thickness of the consolidating soil is therefore $L = 2H_{d}$. The governing partial differential equation for the excess pore pressure $u(z,t)$ is the diffusion equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c_{v} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$$\nwhere $z$ is the spatial coordinate normal to the interface. Let the interface be at $z=0$. The drained boundaries are at $z = \\pm H_{d}$. The boundary conditions are $u(\\pm H_{d}, t) = 0$ for $t > 0$. The initial condition is a uniform excess pore pressure $u(z, 0) = u_{0}$ for $-H_{d} < z < H_{d}$.\n\nCrucially, the problem specifies that the pore pressure relevant for sliding, $u(t)$, is to be taken as the *spatial average* of the excess pore pressure throughout the consolidating layers at time $t$. Let us denote this average pressure as $\\bar{u}(t)$. It is defined as:\n$$\\bar{u}(t) = \\frac{1}{2H_{d}} \\int_{-H_{d}}^{H_{d}} u(z,t) \\, dz$$\n\nThe solution for the average excess pore pressure $\\bar{u}(t)$ for these initial and boundary conditions is a standard result from consolidation theory. It can be expressed as a Fourier series. The average degree of consolidation, $U_{av}(t)$, is defined as $U_{av}(t) = 1 - \\bar{u}(t)/u_{0}$. The solution for $U_{av}(t)$ is:\n$$U_{av}(t) = 1 - \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{8}{(2m+1)^2 \\pi^2} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(2m+1)^2 \\pi^2 c_{v} t}{4 H_{d}^2} \\right)$$\nFrom this, we can write the average excess pore pressure $\\bar{u}(t)$ as:\n$$\\bar{u}(t) = u_{0} (1 - U_{av}(t)) = u_{0} \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{8}{(2m+1)^2 \\pi^2} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(2m+1)^2 \\pi^2 c_{v} t}{4 H_{d}^2} \\right)$$\nAccording to the problem's assumption, we set the interface pore pressure for the friction calculation to this average value: $u(t) = \\bar{u}(t)$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $u(t)$ into our equation for $T_{c}(t)$:\n$$T_{c}(t) = \\mu \\left( N - A \\, u_{0} \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{8}{(2m+1)^2 \\pi^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2m+1)^2 \\pi^2 c_{v} t}{4 H_{d}^2}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the time-dependent critical shear force for sliding onset. The series is convergent.\n\nTo explain qualitatively how increasing consolidation time $t$ influences the stability of the interface, we analyze the derived expression for $T_{c}(t)$. The stability is directly related to the magnitude of $T_c(t)$: a higher value indicates greater resistance to sliding.\n\nThe expression for $T_{c}(t)$ contains a summation term. Each term in the sum includes an exponential factor $\\exp(-k_{m}t)$, where $k_{m} = \\frac{(2m+1)^2 \\pi^2 c_{v}}{4 H_{d}^2}$ is a positive constant for each mode $m$. As time $t$ increases, each exponential term decays towards zero. Consequently, the entire summation, which represents the average excess pore pressure $\\bar{u}(t)$, decreases monotonically with time.\n- At time $t=0$, the exponential term is $1$. The sum evaluates to $1$ (since $\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{8}{(2m+1)^2\\pi^2} = 1$), so $\\bar{u}(0) = u_{0}$. The initial critical shear force is $T_{c}(0) = \\mu(N - A u_{0})$.\n- As time $t \\to \\infty$, the exponential term and thus the entire summation go to $0$. The excess pore pressure fully dissipates, $\\bar{u}(\\infty) = 0$. The long-term critical shear force is $T_{c}(\\infty) = \\mu N$.\n\nSince the average pore pressure $u(t)$ decreases over time from $u_{0}$ to $0$, the effective normal stress $p'(t) = N/A - u(t)$ increases over time. According to the Coulomb criterion, the shear strength $\\tau_c(t)$ is directly proportional to $p'(t)$. Therefore, the critical shear force $T_{c}(t)$ increases monotonically with time from an initial value of $\\mu(N - A u_{0})$ to a final, fully drained value of $\\mu N$. This process, where the frictional strength of an interface increases due to pore pressure dissipation, is known as frictional strengthening. Thus, increasing consolidation time enhances the stability of the interface against shear-induced sliding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mu \\left( N - A u_{0} \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{8}{\\pi^2 (2m+1)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2m+1)^2 \\pi^2 c_{v} t}{4 H_{d}^2}\\right) \\right)}$$", "id": "3512291"}, {"introduction": "To implement rate-independent models like Coulomb friction within a computational simulation, we require a robust algorithm to manage the abrupt switch between elastic (stick) and plastic (slip) states.

The model describes the tangential behavior of a frictional interface using a spring-slider system. The solution will be structured following the standard predictor-corrector framework of computational plasticity. All quantities are expressed in SI units.\n\nThe core kinematic assumption is the additive decomposition of the total relative tangential displacement increment, $\\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t$, into an elastic part, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t$, and a plastic (slip) part, $\\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t^p$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t = \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t + \\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t^p\n$$\nThe state of the interface at the beginning of an increment is defined by the elastic tangential displacement from the previous step, $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{old}}$. The goal is to compute the updated state variables $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{new}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{new}}$ given the increment $\\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t$ and the constant normal pressure $p_n$.\n\n### Step 1: Elastic Predictor (Trial State)\n\nThe first step in a return-mapping algorithm is to assume that the entire increment is purely elastic. This is the \"predictor\" step. Under this assumption, the plastic slip increment is zero, i.e., $\\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t^p = \\mathbf{0}$. The elastic displacement increment is therefore equal to the total imposed displacement increment.\n\nThe trial elastic displacement, $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{trial}}$, is calculated by adding the increment to the previous state:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{trial}} = \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{old}} + \\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t\n$$\nUsing the given linear elastic contact law, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = k_t \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t$, the trial tangential traction, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{trial}}$, is computed:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{trial}} = k_t \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{trial}}\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Admissibility Check (Yield Condition)\n\nThe trial state must be checked against the friction admissibility criterion, which states that the magnitude of the tangential traction cannot exceed a limit proportional to the normal pressure. This is the Coulomb friction law: $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| \\le \\mu p_n$. We can define a yield function, $f$, to formalize this check:\n$$\nf(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}, p_n) = \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| - \\mu p_n\n$$\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm.

The initial assumption of pure elastic behavior was correct. No plastic slip has occurred. The trial state is accepted as the final state for the increment.\nThe updated variables are:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{trial}}\n$$\nThe plastic slip increment is confirmed to be zero: $\\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t^p = \\mathbf{0}$. The process for this increment is elastic stick. As per the problem statement, the boundary case where $f^{\\mathrm{trial}} = 0$ (the trial state lies exactly on the admissible surface) is treated as elastic stick because no correction is required.\n\n**Case B: Plastic Slip ($f^{\\mathrm{trial}} > 0$)**\n\nIf the trial yield function is greater than zero, the trial state is inadmissible and physically impossible. The assumption of pure elastic behavior was incorrect, and plastic slip must occur to maintain the traction on the yield surface. The \"corrector\" step involves a \"return mapping\" that projects the trial traction back onto the admissible boundary (the yield surface).\n\nFor rate-independent Coulomb friction, the associative flow rule dictates that the direction of plastic slip, $\\Delta \\mathbf{u}_t^p$, is normal to the yield surface in stress space. The yield surface is a circle of radius $\\mu p_n$ in the $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$-plane. The outward normal direction at a point $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ on the yield surface is $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} / \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\|$. The return mapping, for consistency, uses the direction of the trial stress, which represents the direction of elastic driving force.\n\nThe corrected traction, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{new}}$, must lie on the yield surface, meaning its magnitude must be exactly $\\mu p_n$. Its direction is preserved from the trial state:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{new}} = (\\mu p_n) \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{trial}}}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\|}\n$$\nThis is a radial return to the yield circle.

The return mapping projects the traction to a point of zero magnitude: $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\mathbf{0}$. Consequently, the final elastic displacement is also zero: $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\mathbf{0}$. This represents unresisted free slip.\n    - If $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\| = 0$, then $f^{\\mathrm{trial}} = 0$, indicating stick. The final state is $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{trial}}$.\n\n- **$\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}^{\\mathrm{trial}}\\| = 0$**: This can only occur if $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_t^{\\mathrm{trial}} = \\mathbf{0}$.

It correctly identifies the core feature of the pure Coulomb model—the absence of an intrinsic length scale—that leads to the pathology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe problem concerns the localization of slip on a frictional interface $\\Gamma$ within a continuum body $\\Omega$. Under quasi-static conditions, the behavior of the system is governed by the principle of minimum potential energy in an incremental sense. The total incremental work done by external forces, $d\\mathcal{W}_{ext}$, must balance the change in stored elastic strain energy in the bulk, $d\\mathcal{U}$, and the energy dissipated by friction on the interface, $d\\mathcal{D}$.\n$$d\\mathcal{W}_{ext} = d\\mathcal{U} + d\\mathcal{D}$$\nThe dissipated energy increment $d\\mathcal{D}$ occurs exclusively on the interface $\\Gamma$ where slip occurs. For a slip increment $ds$, the dissipation is given by $d\\mathcal{D} = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\tau \\, ds \\, dA$.\n\nThe rate-independent Coulomb friction law states that slip can only occur when the shear traction $\\tau$ reaches its limit, $\\tau = \\mu \\sigma_n$. The total energy dissipated over a finite slip path $s$ is:\n$$\\mathcal{D} = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\left( \\int_0^s \\mu \\sigma_n \\, ds' \\right) dA$$\nAssuming $\\mu$ and $\\sigma_n$ are constant during the slip process, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathcal{D} = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\mu \\sigma_n s \\, dA$$\nThe critical observation is that the dissipated energy $\\mathcal{D}$ depends only on the local slip magnitude $s$, and not on its spatial variation or gradient, $\\nabla_{\\Gamma} s$, along the interface. This means the model lacks an intrinsic material length scale that would penalize sharp changes in slip distribution.\n\nWhen discretized using Finite Elements, the interface $\\Gamma$ is represented by a series of facets (or edges in $2$D) of characteristic size $h$. The integral for dissipated energy becomes a sum over these facets. From an energy minimization standpoint, the discrete system will seek the path of least resistance. If a certain macroscopic slip must be accommodated, the system can do so by distributing the slip over many elements or concentrating it in a very small region. Because there is no energy penalty associated with the *gradient* of slip, the system finds it energetically favorable to concentrate all deformation into the smallest possible zone that the mesh allows, i.e., a single element or node. This minimizes the associated strain energy stored in the surrounding bulk material.\n\nAs the mesh is refined ($h \\to 0$), this zone of localized slip shrinks proportionally. The numerical solution changes qualitatively with the mesh, predicting an infinitely sharp slip zone. This leads to results that are not objective: quantities like the peak strain in the adjacent material and the total dissipated energy may not converge to a meaningful physical value. This phenomenon is termed \"pathological mesh dependency\" and signals that the underlying continuum model is ill-posed for localization problems.\n\nTo remedy this, the model must be regularized by introducing an intrinsic length scale. This ensures that the energy required to form a shear band or slip zone is a well-defined material property, rendering the solution mesh-objective.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. In a rate-independent Coulomb interface with no internal length scale, the FE solution may develop pathological localization of slip to a single facet as the mesh is refined because the dissipated work depends only on the magnitude of slip and not on its spatial gradient along $\\Gamma$; adding a slip-gradient penalty along $\\Gamma$ that introduces a material length $\\ell$ restores well-posedness and yields mesh-objective distributions of slip and dissipation.**\nThis statement accurately diagnoses the problem and proposes a valid regularization strategy. The cause is correctly identified as the absence of a dependence on the slip gradient in the energy dissipation term. Introducing a gradient-dependent term, such as a penalty of the form $\\int_{\\Gamma} k (\\nabla_{\\Gamma} s)^2 dA$, enriches the continuum model. This term penalizes high slip gradients, forcing the slip to be distributed over a finite width related to a material length scale $\\ell$ (which can be derived from $k$ and other material parameters). This makes the problem well-posed and leads to mesh-convergent solutions for slip distribution and energy dissipation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Increasing the penalty parameter in a penalty enforcement of the contact constraints is sufficient, by itself, to eliminate mesh dependency in the slip distribution, because a larger penalty makes the constraints harder and thereby regularizes the solution independently of the mesh size.**\nThe penalty parameter in a penalty method relates to the enforcement of the kinematic constraints (e.g., non-penetration in the normal direction or the stick condition $\\tau  \\mu\\sigma_n$ in the tangential direction). A higher penalty value provides a better approximation of a rigid constraint. However, this parameter does not alter the fundamental constitutive law governing behavior *after* slip has initiated (i.e., when $\\tau = \\mu\\sigma_n$). The ill-posedness stems from the dissipative part of the model, which lacks a length scale. The penalty parameter does not introduce such a scale. Therefore, increasing it will not resolve the pathological mesh dependency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Introducing a small tangential viscosity in the friction law, proportional to the slip rate, suppresses slip jumps and produces convergent solutions under quasi-static loading as the mesh is refined; to achieve mesh-objective energy dissipation, the viscosity must be selected in proportion to the element size.**\nIntroducing viscosity (e.g., $\\tau = \\mu\\sigma_n + \\eta \\dot{s}$) is a form of regularization known as viscoplastic regularization. The rate-dependent term $\\eta \\dot{s}$ can indeed regularize the governing equations and lead to convergent numerical solutions. However, the second part of the statement reveals a critical flaw. A truly mesh-objective model should rely solely on material parameters that are independent of the discretization. The assertion that the viscosity parameter $\\eta$ must be scaled with the element size $h$ (\"$\\eta$ ... selected in proportion to the element size\") means that the model itself is being changed as the mesh is refined. This is an algorithmic device or numerical trick to force a desired outcome (like a specific total energy dissipation), not a fundamental regularization of the physical model. By definition, a model whose parameters depend on the mesh size is not mesh-objective.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A cohesive zone model with linear softening calibrated by a fracture energy per unit area $G_f$ and a peak shear strength, embedded at $\\Gamma$ and combined with Coulomb sliding at peak, introduces a characteristic process-zone length that renders the dissipated energy per unit area independent of the mesh and spreads slip over an objective length scale.**\nThis statement describes a physically-based regularization method. A cohesive zone model (CZM) enriches the interface law by introducing a traction-separation/slip relationship that includes softening. The area under this curve is the fracture energy $G_f$, a material property representing the energy required to create a unit area of new \"surface\" (or a fully developed slip plane). The inclusion of $G_f$ and a peak strength $\\tau_{max}$ introduces an intrinsic material length scale into the model (e.g., $L_{ch} \\propto E G_f / \\tau_{max}^2$, where $E$ is a bulk modulus). This length scale governs the size of the \"process zone\" over which slip localizes. As long as the mesh is fine enough to resolve this characteristic length, the slip distribution and the total dissipated energy become objective and independent of the mesh size.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Using augmented Lagrangian enforcement of contact with Coulomb friction guarantees mesh-independent slip distributions because the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are solved exactly once the augmentation parameter is fixed, thereby removing the source of non-uniqueness.**\nThe augmented Lagrangian method is a numerical algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems. It is highly effective for accurately enforcing the KKT complementarity conditions of the discrete contact problem. However, the source of pathological mesh dependency is not the inaccurate solution of the discrete algebraic system. The problem is more fundamental: the discrete system itself is a representation of an ill-posed continuum model. An accurate solver like the augmented Lagrangian method will simply find the pathological, mesh-dependent solution more accurately and robustly; it does not regularize the underlying physics. The non-uniqueness and mesh-dependency are inherent to the model, not the solver.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3512317"}]}
