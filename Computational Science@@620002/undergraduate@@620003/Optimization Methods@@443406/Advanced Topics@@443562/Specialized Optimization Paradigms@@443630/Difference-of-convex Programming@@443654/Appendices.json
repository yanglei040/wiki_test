A natural choice for the decomposition is:\n$$\ng(x) = \\max_{i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}} \\, a_i^\\top x\n$$\n$$\nh(x) = \\mu \\,\\|x\\|_2^2 = 2 \\,\\|x\\|_2^2\n$$\nWith this choice, it is clear that $f(x) = g(x) - h(x)$. We must now demonstrate that both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are convex functions on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nFor $g(x)$:\nFor each index $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the function $g_i(x) = a_i^\\top x$ is a linear functional on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Any linear function is also an affine function, and all affine functions are convex (and concave). The function $g(x)$ is defined as the pointwise maximum of these three convex functions, $g(x) = \\max\\{g_1(x), g_2(x), g_3(x)\\}$. A fundamental property in convex analysis states that the pointwise maximum of a collection of convex functions is itself a convex function. Therefore, $g(x)$ is a convex function on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nFor $h(x)$:\nThe function $h(x)$ is given by $h(x) = 2\\|x\\|_2^2$. In coordinates, for $x = \\begin{pmatrix}x_1 & x_2 & x_3\\end{pmatrix}^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, this is $h(x) = 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2)$. This is a quadratic function of $x$. A twice-differentiable function is convex if and only if its Hessian matrix is positive semidefinite over its entire domain. The gradient of $h(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla h(x) = \\nabla \\left( 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2) \\right) = 2 \\begin{pmatrix} 2x_1 \\\\ 2x_2 \\\\ 2x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = 4x\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix of $h(x)$ is the Jacobian of its gradient:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 h(x) = \\nabla(4x) = 4I_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $I_3$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix are all equal to $4$, which are strictly positive. Thus, the Hessian matrix $\\nabla^2 h(x)$ is positive definite for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. This proves that $h(x)$ is a strictly convex function on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nSince both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are convex, the decomposition $f(x) = g(x) - h(x)$ is a valid DC decomposition.\n\nTask 2: Characterize $\\partial g(x_0)$ at $x_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$ and find the minimal norm subgradient.\n\nFirst, we must identify the active affine functions at $x_0$. We evaluate $a_i^\\top x_0$ for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$\na_1^\\top x_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1 & 0\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = 1(1) - 1(1) + 0(1) = 0\n$$\n$$\na_2^\\top x_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 2 & -1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = 0(1) + 2(1) - 1(1) = 1\n$$\n$$\na_3^\\top x_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 & 2\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = -1(1) + 0(1) + 2(1) = 1\n$$\nThe value of $g(x_0)$ is the maximum of these values: $g(x_0) = \\max\\{0, 1, 1\\} = 1$.\nThe set of active indices at $x_0$, denoted $I(x_0)$, consists of the indices for which $a_i^\\top x_0 = g(x_0)$. In this case, $I(x_0) = \\{2, 3\\}$. The active affine functions are $a_2^\\top x$ and $a_3^\\top x$.\n\nThe subdifferential of $g(x)$ at a point $x_0$ is given by the convex hull of the gradients (or subgradients) of the active functions at that point. Since the functions $g_i(x)=a_i^\\top x$ are differentiable, their subdifferential is the singleton set containing their gradient, i.e., $\\partial g_i(x_0) = \\{\\nabla g_i(x_0)\\} = \\{a_i\\}$.\nThe subdifferential of $g$ at $x_0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\partial g(x_0) = \\text{conv} \\left( \\bigcup_{i \\in I(x_0)} \\{a_i\\} \\right) = \\text{conv}\\{a_2, a_3\\}\n$$\nThis is the line segment in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ connecting the vectors $a_2$ and $a_3$. Any subgradient $v \\in \\partial g(x_0)$ can be expressed as a convex combination of $a_2$ and $a_3$:\n$$\nv = \\lambda a_2 + (1-\\lambda) a_3, \\quad \\text{for } \\lambda \\in [0, 1]\n$$\nSubstituting the vectors $a_2$ and $a_3$:\n$$\nv(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\2\\\\-1\\end{pmatrix} + (1-\\lambda) \\begin{pmatrix}-1\\\\0\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -(1-\\lambda) \\\\ 2\\lambda \\\\ -\\lambda + 2(1-\\lambda) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda-1 \\\\ 2\\lambda \\\\ 2-3\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe need to find the subgradient with the minimal Euclidean norm. This is equivalent to finding the vector $v$ on the segment $[a_2, a_3]$ that is closest to the origin. We can achieve this by minimizing the squared Euclidean norm $\\|v(\\lambda)\\|_2^2$ with respect to $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$.\n$$\n\\|v(\\lambda)\\|_2^2 = (\\lambda-1)^2 + (2\\lambda)^2 + (2-3\\lambda)^2\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n\\|v(\\lambda)\\|_2^2 = (\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1) + 4\\lambda^2 + (4 - 12\\lambda + 9\\lambda^2) = 14\\lambda^2 - 14\\lambda + 5\n$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $\\lambda$, representing an upward-opening parabola. Its minimum is located at the vertex. We find the minimizing $\\lambda$ by setting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} (14\\lambda^2 - 14\\lambda + 5) = 28\\lambda - 14 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ gives $\\lambda = \\frac{14}{28} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince this value $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$ lies within the interval $[0, 1]$, it is the true minimizer.\n\nWe find the unique subgradient with minimal Euclidean norm by substituting $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$ back into the expression for $v(\\lambda)$:\n$$\nv_{\\min} = v\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}-1 \\\\ 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\\\ 2-3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\frac{4}{2}-\\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this vector to be reported as a row vector.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & 1 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3119906"}, {"introduction": "Once you can decompose a function into a DC form, the next step is to learn how to optimize it.

A DC split expresses $f(x)$ as a difference of two convex functions, $f(x) = g(x) - h(x)$.\n\nWe are guided by two foundational principles of convex analysis:\n1.  The pointwise maximum of a collection of convex functions is itself a convex function.\n2.  The product of a non-negative scalar and a convex function is a convex function.\n\nLet's decompose the function $f(x)$ into two parts.\nThe first part is $\\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} a_i^\\top x$. For each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$, the function $l_i(x) = a_i^\\top x$ is an affine (and therefore convex) function of $x$. According to the first principle, the pointwise maximum of these affine functions is convex. Let's define this part as $g(x)$:\n$$g(x) = \\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} a_i^\\top x$$\nBy definition, $g(x)$ is a convex function.\n\nThe second part of $f(x)$ is $-\\alpha\\|x\\|_2^2$. This is the negative of the function $\\alpha\\|x\\|_2^2$. The squared Euclidean norm, $\\|x\\|_2^2$, is a well-known convex function. According to the second principle, since $\\alpha > 0$, the function $h(x) = \\alpha\\|x\\|_2^2$ is also a convex function.\n\nWith these definitions, the original function $f(x)$ can be written as:\n$$f(x) = g(x) - h(x) = \\left( \\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} a_i^\\top x \\right) - \\left( \\alpha\\|x\\|_2^2 \\right)$$\nThis provides an explicit DC split for $f(x)$ with $g(x) = \\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} a_i^\\top x$ and $h(x) = \\alpha\\|x\\|_2^2$, both of which are convex functions.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the DCA Subproblem and LP Equivalence\n\nThe DCA is an iterative method for minimizing a DC function $f(x) = g(x) - h(x)$. At each iteration $k$, given the current point $x^{(k)}$, the algorithm constructs a convex model of $f(x)$ by replacing the function $h(x)$ with its first-order Taylor approximation around $x^{(k)}$. The next iterate, $x^{(k+1)}$, is obtained by minimizing this convex model.\n\nThe general one-step update rule for DCA is given by:\n$$x^{(k+1)} \\in \\arg\\min_{y} \\left( g(y) - (h(x^{(k)}) + \\langle \\nabla h(x^{(k)}), y - x^{(k)} \\rangle) \\right)$$\nSince $h(x^{(k)})$ and $\\langle \\nabla h(x^{(k)}), x^{(k)} \\rangle$ are constant terms with respect to the optimization variable $y$, minimizing the expression above is equivalent to minimizing:\n$$x^{(k+1)} \\in \\arg\\min_{y} \\left( g(y) - \\langle \\nabla h(x^{(k)}), y \\rangle \\right)$$\nThe problem specifies that this minimization should be performed over the compact convex set $C = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : -R \\le x_j \\le R \\text{ for all } j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\\}$. Starting from an initial point $x^{(0)}$, the first iteration is to find $x^{(1)}$ by solving:\n$$x^{(1)} \\in \\arg\\min_{y \\in C} \\left( g(y) - \\langle \\nabla h(x^{(0)}), y \\rangle \\right)$$\nFrom Part 1, we have $g(y) = \\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} a_i^\\top y$ and $h(x) = \\alpha\\|x\\|_2^2 = \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2$. The gradient of $h(x)$ is $\\nabla h(x) = 2\\alpha x$. At the point $x^{(0)}$, the gradient is $\\nabla h(x^{(0)}) = 2\\alpha x^{(0)}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the subproblem objective gives:\n$$ g(y) - \\langle \\nabla h(x^{(0)}), y \\rangle = \\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} a_i^\\top y - \\langle 2\\alpha x^{(0)}, y \\rangle $$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product, we can combine the terms inside the maximum:\n$$ \\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} a_i^\\top y - (2\\alpha x^{(0)})^\\top y = \\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} (a_i - 2\\alpha x^{(0)})^\\top y $$\nThe DCA subproblem is thus:\n$$ x^{(1)} \\in \\arg\\min_{y \\in C} \\left( \\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}} (a_i - 2\\alpha x^{(0)})^\\top y \\right) $$\nThis is a minimax problem, which can be reformulated as a linear program (LP). We introduce an auxiliary scalar variable $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The objective $\\max_i (\\dots)$ is minimized if we minimize $t$ subject to the condition $t \\ge \\max_i (\\dots)$, which is equivalent to the system of linear inequalities:\n$$ t \\ge (a_i - 2\\alpha x^{(0)})^\\top y \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\} $$\nThe complete optimization problem, incorporating the domain constraint $y \\in C$, becomes an LP in the variables $(y, t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$ \\min_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n, t \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\quad t $$\n$$ \\text{subject to:} $$\n$$ (a_i - 2\\alpha x^{(0)})^\\top y \\le t \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\} $$\n$$ -R \\le y_j \\le R \\quad \\text{for all } j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} $$\nThis LP formulation is identical to the one provided in the problem statement. The optimal vector $y$ from this LP is the solution $x^{(1)}$.\n\n### Part 3: Implementation\n\nThe provided Python code implements the solution to the derived LP for each test case. It uses the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function, a standard numerical solver for linear programs. For each test case, the code first constructs the parameters of the LP: the cost vector `c`, the inequality constraint matrix `A_ub`, the inequality constraint bounds `b_ub`, and the variable bounds.

Let the set of undirected edges be all pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \\le i < j \\le n$, and let the edge weight vector be $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ with $m = n(n-1)/2$, where $w_{ij} \\ge 0$ for all edges.\n- Let the baseline affinity between nodes $i$ and $j$ be $w^0_{ij} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\| \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j \\|_2^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)$ where $\\sigma > 0$ is given and $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ are the coordinates of node $i$.\n- The learning objective is to estimate $\\mathbf{w}$ that is close to $\\mathbf{w}^0$ while incurring capped $\\ell_1$ regularization to promote sparsity. The optimization problem is:\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m} \\; F(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^0 \\|_2^2 + \\sum_{e=1}^m p_{\\lambda,\\theta}(w_e)\n\\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{w} \\ge \\mathbf{l},\n$$\nwhere the inequality is elementwise, and $\\mathbf{l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m_{\\ge 0}$ is a vector of lower bounds. To preserve connectivity, $\\mathbf{l}$ must enforce $w_e \\ge \\tau$ for all edges $e$ in a fixed spanning tree $T$ with a specified $\\tau > 0$, and $w_e \\ge 0$ for all other edges.\n- You must express the capped $\\ell_1$ penalty as a DC function (i.e., identify convex $G$ and convex $H$ such that $p_{\\lambda,\\theta}(x) = G(x) - H(x)$) and apply the DCA. In each DCA iteration, you will:\n    1. Compute a subgradient $\\mathbf{s}^k \\in \\partial H(\\mathbf{w}^k)$.\n    2. Solve the convex subproblem to produce $\\mathbf{w}^{k+1}$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{w}^{k+1} \\in \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{w} \\ge \\mathbf{l}} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^0 \\|_2^2 + \\sum_{e=1}^m G(w_e) - \\langle \\mathbf{s}^k, \\mathbf{w} \\rangle \\right\\}.\n    $$\n- The convex subproblem is separable across coordinates under the described objective and box constraints. You must implement an exact per-coordinate solver for this convex subproblem under the nonnegativity and spanning-tree lower-bound constraints.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Implement DCA with a stopping criterion based on the relative change in $\\mathbf{w}$, i.e., stop when $\\frac{\\| \\mathbf{w}^{k+1} - \\mathbf{w}^{k} \\|_2}{\\max\\{1, \\| \\mathbf{w}^{k} \\|_2\\}} \\le \\varepsilon$ or when an iteration cap is reached, where $\\varepsilon > 0$ is specified.\n- Construct the spanning tree $T$ as a minimum spanning tree of the complete graph using pairwise Euclidean distances between nodes as edge costs. Enforce $w_e \\ge \\tau$ for all $e \\in T$ and $w_e \\ge 0$ otherwise.\n- After convergence, construct the undirected adjacency matrix of the learned graph and verify connectivity using a traversal that treats an edge as present if its weight is strictly greater than $0$.\n\nTest suite:\nFor all test cases, parameters include the node coordinates, $\\sigma$, $\\lambda$, $\\theta$, $\\tau$, maximum iterations $K_{\\max}$, and tolerance $\\varepsilon$. Your program must execute the three test cases below and output results as specified.\n\n- Test case $1$ (happy path):\n    - Nodes $n = 5$ with coordinates:\n      $\\mathbf{x}_1 = (0,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_2 = (1,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_3 = (1,1)$, $\\mathbf{x}_4 = (0,1)$, $\\mathbf{x}_5 = (0.5,0.2)$.\n    - Parameters: $\\sigma = 0.8$, $\\lambda = 0.3$, $\\theta = 0.15$, $\\tau = 0.05$, $K_{\\max} = 50$, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$.\n- Test case $2$ (strong sparsity pressure and colinear geometry):\n    - Nodes $n = 4$ with coordinates:\n      $\\mathbf{x}_1 = (0,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_2 = (0.5,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_3 = (1.0,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_4 = (1.5,0)$.\n    - Parameters: $\\sigma = 0.5$, $\\lambda = 0.5$, $\\theta = 0.05$, $\\tau = 0.05$, $K_{\\max} = 50$, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$.\n- Test case $3$ (weak sparsity due to large cap):\n    - Nodes $n = 6$ with coordinates:\n      $\\mathbf{x}_1 = (0,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_2 = (0.3,0.1)$, $\\mathbf{x}_3 = (0.6,0)$, $\\mathbf{x}_4 = (0.0,0.6)$, $\\mathbf{x}_5 = (0.6,0.6)$, $\\mathbf{x}_6 = (0.3,0.3)$.\n    - Parameters: $\\sigma = 1.0$, $\\lambda = 0.2$, $\\theta = 0.5$, $\\tau = 0.03$, $K_{\\max} = 50$, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, compute and return a list with three entries:\n    $[c, s, b]$ where $c$ is the integer number of edges with learned weights strictly greater than $0$, $s$ is the floating-point sum of all learned edge weights, and $b$ is a boolean indicating whether the learned graph is connected ($\\text{True}$ if connected; $\\text{False}$ otherwise).\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the three results, in order for test cases $1$, $2$, and $3$, as a comma-separated list of lists enclosed in square brackets, i.e., \n$[[c_1,s_1,b_1],[c_2,s_2,b_2],[c_3,s_3,b_3]]$.", "solution": "The user-provided problem is a well-posed optimization task in the domain of graph learning, amenable to the Difference-of-Convex Algorithm (DCA). The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and all parameters are clearly specified. The required methodology is standard in the field of nonconvex optimization. I will now provide a complete solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the following optimization problem:\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m} \\; F(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^0 \\|_2^2 + \\sum_{e=1}^m p_{\\lambda,\\theta}(w_e)\n\\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{w} \\ge \\mathbf{l}\n$$\nwhere $p_{\\lambda,\\theta}(x) = \\min\\{\\lambda |x|, \\theta\\}$ is the capped $\\ell_1$ penalty, and the constraint $\\mathbf{w} \\ge \\mathbf{l}$ ensures non-negativity and enforces connectivity, with $l_e \\ge \\tau > 0$ for edges $e$ in a pre-computed spanning tree and $l_e \\ge 0$ otherwise. Since the constraints enforce $w_e \\ge 0$, the penalty simplifies to $p_{\\lambda,\\theta}(w_e) = \\min\\{\\lambda w_e, \\theta\\}$.\n\n### 1. Difference-of-Convex (DC) Formulation\n\nThe DCA requires the objective function to be expressed as a difference of two convex functions. The objective function $F(\\mathbf{w})$ is the sum of a convex quadratic term and a sum of nonconvex capped $\\ell_1$ penalties. We can formulate the entire objective as a DC function.\n\nThe capped $\\ell_1$ penalty for a non-negative variable $x \\ge 0$ can be written as:\n$$\np_{\\lambda,\\theta}(x) = \\min\\{\\lambda x, \\theta\\}\n$$\nThis is a standard nonconvex function that can be decomposed into a difference of two convex functions. A common decomposition is:\n$$\np_{\\lambda,\\theta}(x) = \\lambda x - \\max\\{0, \\lambda x - \\theta\\}\n$$\nLet's define $g(x) = \\lambda x$ and $h(x) = \\max\\{0, \\lambda x - \\theta\\}$.\n- $g(x)$ is a linear function, which is convex.\n- $h(x)$ is the maximum of two convex functions ($0$ and $\\lambda x - \\theta$), and is therefore convex.\nThus, $p_{\\lambda,\\theta}(x) = g(x) - h(x)$ is a valid DC decomposition.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the entire objective function $F(\\mathbf{w})$ in the form $G(\\mathbf{w}) - H(\\mathbf{w})$:\n$$\nF(\\mathbf{w}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^0 \\|_2^2 + \\sum_{e=1}^m g(w_e) \\right) - \\sum_{e=1}^m h(w_e)\n$$\nLet's define the two convex components:\n1.  $G(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^0 \\|_2^2 + \\sum_{e=1}^m \\lambda w_e = \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^0 \\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\mathbf{1}^T \\mathbf{w}$. This function is strictly convex as it is the sum of a strictly convex quadratic and a linear function.\n2.  $H(\\mathbf{w}) = \\sum_{e=1}^m \\max\\{0, \\lambda w_e - \\theta\\}$. This function is convex as it is a sum of convex functions.\n\n### 2. The Difference-of-Convex Algorithm (DCA)\n\nThe DCA is an iterative algorithm that, at each step $k$, linearizes the concave part $-H(\\mathbf{w})$ around the current iterate $\\mathbf{w}^k$ and solves the resulting convex subproblem. The update rule is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}^{k+1} \\in \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{w} \\ge \\mathbf{l}} \\left\\{ G(\\mathbf{w}) - \\langle \\mathbf{s}^k, \\mathbf{w} \\rangle \\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{s}^k$ is a subgradient of $H$ at $\\mathbf{w}^k$, i.e., $\\mathbf{s}^k \\in \\partial H(\\mathbf{w}^k)$.\n\n**Subgradient Calculation:**\nSince $H(\\mathbf{w}) = \\sum_{e=1}^m h(w_e)$, its subdifferential is the Cartesian product of the subdifferentials of its components. We compute the subgradient $\\mathbf{s}^k$ component-wise: $s_e^k \\in \\partial h(w_e^k)$. The subdifferential of $h(x) = \\max\\{0, \\lambda x - \\theta\\}$ is:\n$$\n\\partial h(x) = \\begin{cases} \\{0\\} & \\text{if } \\lambda x - \\theta < 0 \\iff x < \\theta/\\lambda \\\\ [0, \\lambda] & \\text{if } \\lambda x - \\theta = 0 \\iff x = \\theta/\\lambda \\\\ \\{\\lambda\\} & \\text{if } \\lambda x - \\theta > 0 \\iff x > \\theta/\\lambda \\end{cases}\n$$\nTo obtain a specific subgradient vector $\\mathbf{s}^k$, we can make a deterministic choice at the non-differentiable point. A common choice is to take one of the endpoints of the interval, for instance, $\\lambda$. So we set:\n$$\ns_e^k = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } w_e^k < \\theta/\\lambda \\\\ \\lambda & \\text{if } w_e^k \\ge \\theta/\\lambda \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Solving the Convex Subproblem:**\nThe subproblem for $\\mathbf{w}^{k+1}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}^{k+1} = \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{w} \\ge \\mathbf{l}} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}^0 \\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{e=1}^m w_e - \\sum_{e=1}^m s_e^k w_e \\right\\}\n$$\nThis optimization problem is separable, meaning we can solve for each component $w_e$ independently:\n$$\nw_e^{k+1} = \\arg\\min_{w_e \\ge l_e} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2} (w_e - w_e^0)^2 + (\\lambda - s_e^k) w_e \\right\\}\n$$\nThis is a one-dimensional quadratic minimization subject to a lower-bound constraint. The unconstrained minimizer, $w_e^*$, is found by setting the derivative of the objective with respect to $w_e$ to zero:\n$$\n(w_e - w_e^0) + (\\lambda - s_e^k) = 0 \\implies w_e^* = w_e^0 - (\\lambda - s_e^k)\n$$\nThe solution to the constrained problem is the projection of $w_e^*$ onto the feasible set $[l_e, \\infty)$:\n$$\nw_e^{k+1} = \\max\\{l_e, w_e^*\\} = \\max\\{l_e, w_e^0 - (\\lambda - s_e^k)\\}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s_e^k$, we get the closed-form update rule for each component:\n- If $w_e^k < \\theta/\\lambda$, then $s_e^k=0$, and $w_e^{k+1} = \\max\\{l_e, w_e^0 - \\lambda\\}$.\n- If $w_e^k \\ge \\theta/\\lambda$, then $s_e^k=\\lambda$, and $w_e^{k+1} = \\max\\{l_e, w_e^0\\}$.\n\n### 3. Algorithmic Procedure\n\nThe complete algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    a. Given node coordinates $\\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}$, compute the pairwise Euclidean distance matrix.\n    b. Construct the complete graph and compute its Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using the distances as edge costs.\n    c. Define the lower bound vector $\\mathbf{l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$: for each edge $e$, set $l_e = \\tau$ if $e$ is in the MST, and $l_e = 0$ otherwise.\n    d. Compute the baseline affinity vector $\\mathbf{w}^0$ where $w^0_{ij} = \\exp(-\\|\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j\\|_2^2 / \\sigma^2)$.\n    e. Initialize the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}^0_{\\text{iter}} = \\max\\{\\mathbf{w}^0, \\mathbf{l}\\}$ to ensure the starting point is feasible. For simplicity, we denote the sequence of iterates as $\\mathbf{w}^k$.\n\n2.  **DCA Iterations**: For $k=0, 1, ..., K_{\\max}-1$:\n    a. Compute the next iterate $\\mathbf{w}^{k+1}$ using the per-component update rule derived above.\n    b. Check the stopping criterion: if $\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{w}^{k+1} - \\mathbf{w}^k\\|_2}{\\max\\{1, \\|\\mathbf{w}^k\\|_2\\}} \\le \\varepsilon$, terminate the loop.\n\n3.  **Result Analysis**:\n    a. Let the final weight vector be $\\mathbf{w}^*$.\n    b. Count the number of edges with strictly positive weights, $c = |\\{e \\mid w^*_e > 0\\}|$.\n    c. Calculate the sum of all learned weights, $s = \\sum_e w^*_e$.\n    d. Verify connectivity: construct an adjacency matrix for the graph where an edge exists if its weight $w^*_e > 0$. Use a graph traversal algorithm (like BFS or DFS) or a connected components algorithm to determine if the graph is connected. This yields the boolean $b$. The construction guarantees $b=\\text{True}$ since the MST edges have weights at least $\\tau>0$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for the provided test cases to generate the required output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform\nfrom scipy.sparse.csgraph import minimum_spanning_tree, connected_components\n\ndef run_dca_for_case(node_coords, sigma, lam, theta, tau, K_max, eps):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the graph learning problem for a single test case using DCA.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(node_coords)\n    m = n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    # Generate an ordered list of edges (i, j) with i < j\n    edges = []\n    edge_map = {}\n    idx = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            edges.append((i, j))\n            edge_map[(i, j)] = idx\n            idx += 1\n\n    # 1.
