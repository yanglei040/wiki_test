The number of maxterms in the canonical POS equals the number of input combinations at which $F=0$. Minimal POS seeks to reduce the number of sum terms (clauses) and the number of literals per clause by forming groups of zeros on a Karnaugh map (K-map), subject to the K-map grouping rules: zeros are grouped in rectangular blocks of size $2^k$ (with $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$) aligned with the K-map adjacency, each block yielding one sum term in the POS with $n-k$ literals for an $n$-variable function.\n\nConsider the following four candidate functions expressed directly in product-of-sums over $5$ variables $A,B,C,D,E$:\n- A) $F(A,B,C,D,E) = (A + B + C)(A + \\overline{B} + D)(\\overline{A} + B + E)(\\overline{A} + \\overline{B} + \\overline{C})$\n- B) $F(A,B,C,D,E) = (A + B + C + D)(\\overline{A} + \\overline{B} + \\overline{C} + \\overline{D})$\n- C) $F(A,B,C,D,E) = (A + B)(\\overline{A} + \\overline{B})(C + D + E)(\\overline{C} + \\overline{D} + \\overline{E})$\n- D) $F(A,B,C,D,E) = (A + B + C)(A + B + \\overline{C})(\\overline{A} + \\overline{B} + D)(\\overline{A} + \\overline{B} + \\overline{D})$\n\nWhich option exhibits the following property: the canonical POS of $F$ has exactly $16$ maxterms, but the minimal POS of $F$ has exactly $4$ sum terms?

For an $n$-variable function, a sum term with $k$ literals is $0$ for $2^{n-k}$ input combinations.

Therefore, the sets of zeros are disjoint, and the total number of zeros is $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16$. The first condition is met.\n\n2.  **Minimal POS Form:** The given expression has $4$ terms. We must determine if it is minimal. A minimal cover must be found using prime implicants. The sets of zeros for each term are disjoint and are not adjacent to each other in a way that allows for larger groupings. For example, the zeros for $(A+B+C)$ require $A=0, B=0, C=0$, while zeros for any other term require a different combination of $A$ and $B$. Therefore, no larger groups can be formed between these blocks of zeros. Each of the original four terms corresponds to a prime implicant, and since they are essential to cover their respective disjoint sets of zeros, the minimal POS form is the original expression.

For example, the input $A=B=C=D=E=0$ makes both $(A+B)$ and $(C+D+E)$ zero. Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the total number of zeros is $|Z_1 \\cup Z_2 \\cup Z_3 \\cup Z_4| = (8+8+4+4) - (1+1+1+1) = 20$, not $16$.\n\n**D) $F(A,B,C,D,E) = (A + B + C)(A + B + \\overline{C})(\\overline{A} + \\overline{B} + D)(\\overline{A} + \\overline{B} + \\overline{D})$**\nThis expression simplifies algebraically.
