The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) exposes four status flags after a subtraction $a - b$: zero $Z$, negative $N$, overflow $V$, and carry $C$. In this design:\n- $Z = 1$ indicates the arithmetic result is exactly zero.\n- $N = 1$ indicates the arithmetic result is negative in two’s-complement representation.\n- $V = 1$ indicates a signed overflow occurred in the subtraction.\n- $C = 1$ indicates a carry out occurred (note: for subtraction, $C = 0$ indicates a borrow).\n\nThe CondMove should execute only when a complex condition is satisfied as follows:\n- The CondMove executes if the signed “greater-than” condition is true for the subtraction, or the subtraction produced an exactly zero result with no carry out, i.e., $Z = 1$ and $C = 0$.\n\nUsing only fundamental Boolean definitions and the known characterization of signed comparisons in two’s-complement arithmetic, derive a Boolean expression for $E$ in terms of the flags $Z$, $N$, $V$, and $C$, and then use a Karnaugh map (K-map) over the $4$ variables $(Z, N, V, C)$ to obtain the simplest Sum of Products (SOP) form.

The derivation will proceed by first translating the specified conditions into a Boolean expression and then using a Karnaugh map (K-map) for simplification.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the conditions for the control signal $E$ to be asserted ($E=1$). The problem states two independent conditions joined by a logical OR.\n\nCondition 1: \"The signed 'greater-than' condition is true for the subtraction.\"\nLet the subtraction be $a - b$. The signed 'greater-than' condition corresponds to $a > b$ in two's-complement arithmetic, which is equivalent to the result of the subtraction $a - b$ being a positive number. In a two's-complement ALU, the sign of the result is determined by a combination of the negative flag ($N$) and the overflow flag ($V$). The true sign of the result is positive if and only if $N \\oplus V = 0$, where $\\oplus$ denotes the exclusive-OR operation. This is because:\n- If no overflow occurs ($V=0$), the sign bit $N$ is correct. For a positive result, we require $N=0$. This gives the term $\\neg V \\land \\neg N$.\n- If an overflow does occur ($V=1$), the sign bit $N$ is inverted. A true positive result would incorrectly be reported as negative, i.e., $N=1$. This gives the term $V \\land N$.\nCombining these, the condition for a non-negative result ($a \\geq b$) is $(\\neg V \\land \\neg N) \\lor (V \\land N)$, which is the exclusive-NOR (XNOR) of $N$ and $V$, often written as $N \\odot V$.\nFor a strictly 'greater-than' condition ($a > b$), the result must not be zero. This is indicated by the zero flag $Z$ being false, i.e., $Z=0$ or $\\neg Z$.\nTherefore, the Boolean expression for the signed 'greater-than' condition ($GT$) is:\n$$GT = \\neg Z \\land ((\\neg N \\land \\neg V) \\lor (N \\land V))$$\n\nCondition 2: \"The subtraction produced an exactly zero result with no carry out.\"\nThis condition translates directly from the problem statement:\n- \"exactly zero result\": $Z=1$.\n- \"no carry out\": For subtraction, the problem states that $C=0$ indicates a borrow, which is synonymous with \"no carry out\" in the context of $a - b$ being implemented as $a + (\\text{not } b) + 1$. Thus, we require $C=0$, or $\\neg C$.\nThe Boolean expression for this condition ($ZC_0$) is:\n$$ZC_0 = Z \\land \\neg C$$\n\nThe total expression for $E$ is the logical OR of these two conditions:\n$$E = GT \\lor ZC_0$$\n$$E = (\\neg Z \\land ((\\neg N \\land \\neg V) \\lor (N \\land V))) \\lor (Z \\land \\neg C)$$\n\nTo find the simplest SOP form, we construct a 4-variable Karnaugh map with variables $Z, N, V, C$. We will arrange the map with $ZN$ on the vertical axis and $VC$ on the horizontal axis, both in Gray code order ($00, 01, 11, 10$).\n\nWe populate the K-map by evaluating $E$ for each of the $16$ possible minterms.\n1.

This covers minterms where $(Z,C)=(1,0)$ and $N,V$ can be anything: $1000, 1010, 1100, 1110$.\n\nThe resulting K-map is as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\large{E} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\large{VC}} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\large{ZN} & 00 & 01 & 11 & 10 \\\\\n00 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n01 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n11 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n10 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNow, we group the $1$s to find the prime implicants and form the minimal SOP expression.\n\n- **Group 1**: A $2 \\times 2$ square comprising the four $1$s in the bottom two rows and the first and last columns.

Total count is $2 + 1 + 3 = 6$. The literal count is indeed reduced from $7$ to $6$.\n- **Structural Trade-off:**\n    - The original two-level SOP form ($W = \\overline{A}C + A\\overline{B}D + CD$) has a maximum logic depth of $2$ (one level of AND gates followed by one level of OR gates). The delay for any input signal is $2$ gate delays.\n    - The factored form $W = \\overline{A}C + D(C + A\\overline{B})$ is a multi-level circuit. The term $D(C + A\\overline{B})$ has a deeper structure. To compute this term, one must first compute $A\\overline{B}$ (1st level, AND), then $C+A\\overline{B}$ (2nd level, OR), and finally $D(C+A\\overline{B})$ (3rd level, AND). This path is 3 levels deep before the final OR gate. The total critical path delay in the factored circuit is increased.\n    - The statement \"introduces an extra logic level on the D path\" correctly identifies the trade-off. While the signal for D itself only passes through two gates (an AND and a final OR), the sub-circuit it is part of ($D(C+A\\overline{B})$) is now deeper, increasing the total circuit delay. The statement correctly characterizes this as an increase in logic depth.\n\n**Verdict for A:** All parts of this statement are correct. It accurately describes the result of minimization, the effect of factoring on literal count, and the structural trade-off in terms of logic depth. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The minimized two-level SOP has a literal count of $8$, and algebraic factoring cannot reduce the literal count without increasing the number of product terms.**\n\n- The minimized SOP has a literal count of $7$, not $8$. An 8-literal solution (e.g., using $BCD$ or $ACD$ instead of $CD$) is not minimal.\n- As demonstrated in the analysis of option A, algebraic factoring can reduce the literal count from $7$ to $6$.\n\n**Verdict for B:** Both claims in this statement are false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A factored form $W = (C + A)\\,(\\overline{A} + D)$ is equivalent to the minimized $SOP$ and reduces the literal count to $5$ without increasing logic depth.**\n\n- Let's test the equivalence by expanding the expression: $W = (C+A)(\\overline{A}+D) = C\\overline{A} + CD + A\\overline{A} + AD = \\overline{A}C + CD + AD$.\n- This expression is not equivalent to the correct function $W = \\overline{A}C + CD + A\\overline{B}D$. The term $A\\overline{B}D$ has been replaced by $AD$.\n- The term $AD$ produces a '1' for $m_{13}$ ($ABCD=1101$), but from the K-map, $W$ should be $0$ for this input combination. The functions are not equivalent.\n\n**Verdict for C:** The claim of functional equivalence is false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Factoring as $W = (C + D)\\,(\\overline{A} + A\\,\\overline{B})$ preserves functional equivalence and reduces the critical path delay relative to the two-level $SOP$.**\n\n- Let's test the functional equivalence. Using the absorption-like identity $X+X'Y=X+Y$, the term $\\overline{A}+A\\overline{B}$ simplifies to $\\overline{A}+\\overline{B}$. So, $W = (C+D)(\\overline{A}+\\overline{B})$.\n- Let's test this with minterm $m_{15}$ ($ABCD=1111$), for which $W$ must be $1$.\n- For $(1,1,1,1)$, the expression evaluates to $(1+1)(\\overline{1}+\\overline{1}) = (1)(0+0) = 0$. This is incorrect. The function should be $1$.\n- Additionally, a two-level SOP realization has the minimum possible delay (2 gate delays). It is impossible for a multi-level factored form to reduce this delay further.\n\n**Verdict for D:** The claim of functional equivalence is false, and the claim of delay reduction is also false. **Incorrect**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly option A provides a correct and consistent analysis of the logic function $W$. It correctly identifies the minimized SOP, its literal count, a valid factored form, the reduced literal count of the factored form, and the associated performance trade-off (increased logic depth).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3653683"}]}
