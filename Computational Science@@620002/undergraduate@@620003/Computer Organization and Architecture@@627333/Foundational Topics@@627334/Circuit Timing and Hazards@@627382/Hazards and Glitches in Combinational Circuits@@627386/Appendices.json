A static-1 hazard may occur in a sum-of-products (SOP) implementation when two adjacent minterms on a Karnaugh map (K-map) are covered by different product terms, and no single product term covers both. This can cause the output to momentarily go to $0$ during a single-input variable transition for which the output should remain at a constant $1$.\n\nFirst, we construct the $4$-variable K-map for the function $f$.

We can identify these by inspection of the map or by computing the consensus terms between pairs of product terms that have one variable in common, one complemented and one not. The consensus theorem states that for an expression $XY + \\overline{X}Z$, the consensus term is $YZ$. Adding this term eliminates the hazard associated with the transition of variable $X$.\n\nWe examine the pairs of given product terms:\n1.  $P_1=(A\\cdot B)$ and $P_3=(\\overline{A}\\cdot \\overline{D})$: These terms have the variable $A$ in opposition. The consensus term is $(B) \\cdot (\\overline{D}) = B\\cdot \\overline{D}$.\n    This term covers the adjacencies between 1s covered by $P_1$ and 1s covered by $P_3$.\n    For example, the transition between $m_4(0100)$ and $m_{12}(1100)$ involves a change in $A$ while $B=1, C=0, D=0$. For these inputs, $f$ reduces to $f = (A\\cdot 1) + (0\\cdot 0) + (\\overline{A}\\cdot \\overline{0}) = A + \\overline{A}$, which is a classic static hazard. Adding the term $B\\overline{D}$ covers both $m_4$ and $m_{12}$ (since for both, $B=1, D=0$), resolving the hazard. Similarly, it covers the adjacency between $m_6(0110)$ and $m_{14}(1110)$.\n\n2.  $P_2=(C\\cdot D)$ and $P_3=(\\overline{A}\\cdot \\overline{D})$: These terms have the variable $D$ in opposition. The consensus term is $(C) \\cdot (\\overline{A}) = \\overline{A}\\cdot C$.\n    This term covers adjacencies between 1s covered by $P_2$ and 1s covered by $P_3$.\n    For example, consider the transition between $m_2(0010)$ and $m_3(0011)$, which involves a change in $D$ while $A=0, B=0, C=1$. For these inputs, $f$ reduces to $f = (0\\cdot 0) + (1\\cdot D) + (\\overline{0}\\cdot \\overline{D}) = D + \\overline{D}$, a static hazard. Adding the term $\\overline{A}C$ covers both $m_2$ and $m_3$ (since for both, $A=0, C=1$), resolving the hazard.

Therefore, there is no consensus term to be generated from this pair.\n\nThe minimal bridging implicants required to eliminate all static-1 hazards are the two consensus terms we found: $B\\cdot\\overline{D}$ and $\\overline{A}\\cdot C$. It is important to verify that these terms only cover cells that are already $1$ in the original function, ensuring the logic function of $f$ is preserved.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Term $B\\cdot \\overline{D}$ covers minterms where $B=1, D=0$: $\\{m_4, m_6, m_{12}, m_{14}\\}$.

The final hazard-free expression is the logical OR of the original terms and the two new bridging terms.\n\nThe original function is $f_{orig} = (A\\cdot B)+(C\\cdot D)+(\\overline{A}\\cdot \\overline{D})$.\nThe added hazard-covering terms are $(B \\cdot \\overline{D})$ and $(\\overline{A} \\cdot C)$.\nThe final hazard-free function is $f_{hf} = (A\\cdot B)+(C\\cdot D)+(\\overline{A}\\cdot \\overline{D})+(B\\cdot \\overline{D})+(\\overline{A}\\cdot C)$.\nThis expression is guaranteed to be free of static-1 hazards.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(A\\cdot B)+(C\\cdot D)+(\\overline{A}\\cdot \\overline{D})+(B\\cdot \\overline{D})+(\\overline{A}\\cdot C)}$$", "id": "3647551"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical knowledge of hazards becomes truly powerful when applied to the analysis of real-world circuits.

Consider two realizations of the SUM output that use common gate-level building blocks. Each gate is modeled as having fixed inertial propagation delay for each input-to-output path, and wires feeding each gate may introduce input-specific path skew.\n\nThe first realization, denoted $\\mathcal{X}$, is the cascaded exclusive-or network\n$$S_{\\mathcal{X}} = (A \\oplus B) \\oplus C_{in},$$\nimplemented with two two-input exclusive-or gates in series.

We must determine if glitches (transient hazards) occur at the outputs $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$ and $S_{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\n**Input Transition and Steady-State Analysis**\n\nThe specified input transition is from $(A, B, C_{in}) = (0, 0, 0)$ to $(A, B, C_{in}) = (1, 1, 1)$ at time $t=0$.\n\n*   The initial output value (for $t  0$) is $S = 0 \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 = 0$.\n*   The final steady-state output value (for $t \\to \\infty$) is $S = 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 1 = (0) \\oplus 1 = 1$.\n\nTherefore, for both circuits, the output is expected to transition from logic $0$ to logic $1$. A glitch is any temporary deviation from this monotonic transition, such as $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\n\n**Analysis of Realization $\\mathcal{X}$**\n\nThe first realization is $S_{\\mathcal{X}} = (A \\oplus B) \\oplus C_{in}$. Let $P = A \\oplus B$. The circuit consists of a gate $G_1$ computing $P$, which feeds a gate $G_2$ that computes $S_{\\mathcal{X}} = P \\oplus C_{in}$.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the intermediate signal $P$**:\n    The signal $P = A \\oplus B$ is the output of gate $G_1$. The propagation delays from the inputs to $P$ are given as $\\tau_{A\\to P} = 80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ and $\\tau_{B\\to P} = 120\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n    *   Initial state: $A=0, B=0 \\implies P = 0 \\oplus 0 = 0$.\n    *   Final state: $A=1, B=1 \\implies P = 1 \\oplus 1 = 0$.\n    The signal $P$ should remain stable at $0$. However, the unequal delays (path skew) create a hazard.\n    Let's trace the events at the output of $G_1$:\n    *   For $t  80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, the effects of the input changes at $t=0$ have not yet propagated. $P$ remains at its initial value of $0$.\n    *   At $t=80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, the change from $A$ (which is faster) propagates to the output. The gate effectively sees inputs $(A,B)=(1,0)$. It computes $P = 1 \\oplus 0 = 1$. Thus, $P$ transitions $0 \\to 1$.\n    *   At $t=120\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, the change from $B$ (which is slower) propagates to the output. The gate now sees inputs $(A,B)=(1,1)$. It computes $P = 1 \\oplus 1 = 0$. Thus, $P$ transitions $1 \\to 0$.\n    The signal $P(t)$ exhibits a static-0 hazard. It produces a transient pulse: $P$ is $0$, pulses to $1$ during the interval $[80\\,\\mathrm{ps}, 120\\,\\mathrm{ps})$, and returns to $0$. The width of this glitch on signal $P$ is $120\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 80\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the final output $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$**:\n    The signal $S_{\\mathcal{X}} = P \\oplus C_{in}$ is the output of gate $G_2$. Both input paths to $G_2$ have a delay of $\\tau_{G_2} = 80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n    The inputs to $G_2$ are the primary input $C_{in}(t)$ and the internal signal $P(t)$.\n    *   $C_{in}(t)$ transitions $0 \\to 1$ at $t=0$.\n    *   $P(t)$ has the $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$ pulse described above.\n    We can determine the behavior of $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$ by tracking the propagation of events through $G_2$:\n    *   **Event 1**: The change in $C_{in}$ at $t=0$ propagates through $G_2$ and affects $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$ at $t = 0 + \\tau_{G_2} = 80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n    *   **Event 2**: The rising edge of the pulse on $P$ at $t=80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ propagates through $G_2$ and affects $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$ at $t = 80\\,\\mathrm{ps} + \\tau_{G_2} = 160\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n    *   **Event 3**: The falling edge of the pulse on $P$ at $t=120\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ propagates through $G_2$ and affects $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$ at $t = 120\\,\\mathrm{ps} + \\tau_{G_2} = 200\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\n    Now, we construct the waveform of $S_{\\mathcal{X}}(t)$ based on the values of $P$ and $C_{in}$ seen by the logic of $G_2$:\n    *   For $t  80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$: No events have yet affected $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$. It remains at its initial value, $S_{\\mathcal{X}} = P_{initial} \\oplus C_{in, initial} = 0 \\oplus 0 = 0$.\n    *   For $t \\in [80\\,\\mathrm{ps}, 160\\,\\mathrm{ps})$: Event 1 has occurred. The change in $C_{in}$ is now effective at the output. The value of $P$ is still seen as its initial value of $0$. So, $S_{\\mathcal{X}} = P_{initial} \\oplus C_{in, final} = 0 \\oplus 1 = 1$. The output correctly transitions to its final state.\n    *   For $t \\in [160\\,\\mathrm{ps}, 200\\,\\mathrm{ps})$: Event 2 has occurred. The rising edge of the $P$ pulse is now effective. $S_{\\mathcal{X}} = P_{pulse} \\oplus C_{in, final} = 1 \\oplus 1 = 0$. The output deviates from its correct final state, creating a glitch.\n    *   For $t \\ge 200\\,\\mathrm{ps}$: Event 3 has occurred. The falling edge of the $P$ pulse is now effective. $S_{\\mathcal{X}} = P_{final} \\oplus C_{in, final} = 0 \\oplus 1 = 1$. The output returns to its correct final state.\n\n    The output waveform $S_{\\mathcal{X}}(t)$ is $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$. This is a dynamic hazard, which manifests as a single unintended pulse to $0$. The glitch exists for the duration $[160\\,\\mathrm{ps}, 200\\,\\mathrm{ps})$. Its width is $200\\,\\mathrm{ps} - 160\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\n**Analysis of Realization $\\mathcal{M}$**\n\nThe second realization is $S_{\\mathcal{M}} = P' \\cdot C_{in} + P \\cdot \\overline{C_{in}}$, where $P = A \\oplus B$ and $P' = A \\odot B = \\bar{P}$. This logic is equivalent to $S_{\\mathcal{M}} = P \\oplus C_{in}$.\n\n1.  **Analysis of intermediate signals $P$, $P'$, and $\\overline{C_{in}}$**:\n    *   **Signals $P$ and $P'$**: These are produced by a complementary cell with equalized delays: $\\tau_P = \\tau_{P'} = 100\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ for both $A$ and $B$ inputs.\n        *   For $P = A \\oplus B$: Initial value is $0 \\oplus 0 = 0$. Final value is $1 \\oplus 1 = 0$. Since the delays from $A$ and $B$ are equal, the effects of their transitions effectively arrive simultaneously at the XOR logic. The gate transitions from computing based on $(0,0)$ to computing based on $(1,1)$, both of which yield $P=0$. Therefore, $P$ remains stable at $0$ and is glitch-free.\n        *   For $P' = A \\odot B$: Initial value is $0 \\odot 0 = 1$. Final value is $1 \\odot 1 = 1$. For the same reason, $P'$ remains stable at $1$ and is glitch-free.\n    *   **Signal $\\overline{C_{in}}$**: This is produced by an inverter with delay $\\tau_I = 40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$. Since $C_{in}$ transitions $0 \\to 1$ at $t=0$, $\\overline{C_{in}}$ transitions $1 \\to 0$ at $t = 40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the final output $S_{\\mathcal{M}}$**:\n    The MUX implements $S_{\\mathcal{M}} = P' \\cdot C_{in} + P \\cdot \\overline{C_{in}}$. Let's assume $P$ is the select line.\n    *   Since $P(t)=0$ for all time, the MUX is permanently selecting the data input associated with $P=0$. The MUX expression is of the form $\\bar{P} D_0 + P D_1$. Here $P'=\\bar{P}$ and the data input for the $\\bar{P}$ leg is $C_{in}$.\n    *   Thus, the logic simplifies to $S_{\\mathcal{M}} = (1) \\cdot C_{in} + (0) \\cdot \\overline{C_{in}} = C_{in}$.\n    *   The output $S_{\\mathcal{M}}$ should simply follow the input $C_{in}$, delayed by the propagation through the MUX.\n    *   The relevant path is from the $C_{in}$ data input to the MUX output. The delay for this path is given as $\\tau_M = 60\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n    *   $C_{in}$ transitions $0 \\to 1$ at $t=0$. Therefore, $S_{\\mathcal{M}}$ transitions $0 \\to 1$ at $t = 0 + \\tau_M = 60\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\n    *   The change in the other data input, $\\overline{C_{in}}$, at $t=40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ is irrelevant because that path is not selected (since $P$ is stable at $0$).\n    The output $S_{\\mathcal{M}}$ transitions cleanly and monotonically from $0$ to $1$ at $t=60\\,\\mathrm{ps}$. The transition is glitch-free.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$ exhibits two glitches with widths $80\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ and $40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$; $S_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is glitch-free.**\n    Our analysis shows $S_{\\mathcal{X}}$ has only a single glitch of width $40\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.

This advanced practice explores a critical counterexample where the standard method for fixing a static-1 hazard—adding a consensus term—inadvertently introduces a static-0 hazard under a different input transition scenario. By analyzing this situation, you will appreciate the importance of considering multi-input changes and the concept of \"balanced covering\" to create truly glitch-free circuits [@problem_id:3647501].", "problem": "Consider a two-level sum-of-products realization of the Boolean function over primary inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$ given by $F = A'B + AC$. Use the fundamental definition of a static hazard: for a single-input change, if the ideal Boolean function remains constant while the physical circuit output momentarily deviates due to unequal delays in reconvergent paths, the deviation is a static hazard. A static-$1$ hazard is a temporary drop from logical $1$ and a static-$0$ hazard is a temporary rise from logical $0$. Reconvergence causing hazards arises from fanout of a signal into multiple paths with different delays that later combine. Use the consensus theorem: for product terms $x y$ and $x' z$, the consensus term $y z$ is logically redundant, i.e., $xy + x'z + yz = xy + x'z$, but adding $yz$ as a physical path can change delay behavior and hazard properties.\n\nYou are asked to select the option that correctly constructs a counterexample in which adding a single consensus term removes a static-$1$ hazard for one single-variable transition but introduces a static-$0$ glitch for a different multi-variable transition (endpoints logically $0$), and then correctly analyzes the trade-offs and the principle of balanced covering. All options refer to the same base circuit: an inverter generating $A'$ from $A$, two $2$-input AND gates computing $A'B$ and $AC$, and a $3$-input OR gate producing $F$ from their outputs. The added consensus term, when present, is computed by an additional $2$-input AND gate generating $BC$ and feeding the OR. Assume physically realistic, distinct gate and wire delays (strictly positive) and that input transitions can be skewed in time.\n\nWhich option is correct?\n\nA. Add the consensus term $BC$ to form $F_{\\text{cons}} = A'B + AC + BC$. This eliminates the static-$1$ hazard when only $A$ toggles from $A=0$ to $A=1$ with $B=1$ and $C=1$ fixed, since the ideal output remains $1$ and $BC=1$ holds throughout the toggle, providing a single-path cover during any gap where $A'B$ falls before $AC$ rises. Now consider the simultaneous transition from $\\langle A,B,C\\rangle = \\langle 0,0,1\\rangle$ to $\\langle 1,1,0\\rangle$, with $B$ rising slightly before $C$ falls and $A$ rising between them such that neither $A'B$ nor $AC$ ever asserts (for example, $A$ rises early so $A'$ is already low when $B$ reaches $1$, and $C$ falls before $A$ becomes logically effective to make $AC=1$). The endpoints satisfy $F=0$, but due to the overlap window with $B=1$ and $C=1$, the added $BC$ path asserts, producing a temporary $1$ at the OR output: a static-$0$ glitch tied to multi-input skew. Trade-off: the consensus term improves robustness for the $A$-toggle case but creates a new reconvergent condition depending only on $B$ and $C$, making the circuit sensitive to their overlap. Balanced covering requires adding redundancy to cover both the $1$-adjacencies (via $BC$) and the complementary $0$-adjacencies (e.g., ensuring the product-of-sums cover of $F'$ also has consensus-like redundancy), or restructuring to avoid fragile two-variable overlaps, thereby minimizing both static-$1$ and static-$0$ glitches.\n\nB. In any two-level sum-of-products circuit built from primary inputs, adding a single consensus term cannot ever introduce a static-$0$ glitch, because consensus terms only fix hazards and never create new ones. Balanced covering is therefore unnecessary.\n\nC. Add $BC$ and then toggle only $B$ from $B=0$ to $B=1$ with $A=0$ and $C=0$ fixed. Because the endpoints give $F=0$ and $BC=0$ at all times, $F_{\\text{cons}}$ nonetheless produces a static-$0$ glitch, proving that consensus can introduce static-$0$ hazards. Balanced covering is achieved by removing $AC$ entirely and only using $A'B + BC$.\n\nD. Without adding $BC$, both a static-$1$ hazard and a static-$0$ hazard are impossible in $F = A'B + AC$ under any input timing, because $A'B$ and $AC$ are disjoint terms. Balanced covering refers only to Karnaugh map grouping for minimization and does not affect hazards.\n\nSelect the correct option.", "solution": "The user requires a thorough validation of the problem statement, a first-principles derivation of the solution, and a critical evaluation of all provided options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\nThe first step is a meticulous validation of the problem statement, excluding the options.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Function:** A two-level sum-of-products realization of the Boolean function $F = A'B + AC$ over primary inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n- **Circuit Structure:** An inverter for $A'$, two $2$-input AND gates for $A'B$ and $AC$, and a $3$-input OR gate for the output $F$. When a consensus term is added, an additional $2$-input AND gate for $BC$ feeds the OR gate.\n- **Definitions:**\n    - **Static Hazard:** For a single-input change, if the ideal Boolean function remains constant while the physical circuit output momentarily deviates.\n    - **Static-1 Hazard:** A temporary drop from logical $1$.\n    - **Static-0 Hazard:** A temporary rise from logical $0$.\n    - **Consensus Theorem:** $xy + x'z = xy + x'z + yz$. The term $yz$ is the consensus term.\n- **Assumptions:** Physically realistic, distinct gate and wire delays (strictly positive). Input transitions can be skewed in time.\n- **Task:** The core of the question is to identify an option that correctly demonstrates a scenario where adding a consensus term removes a static-$1$ hazard but introduces a static-$0$ glitch for a different, multi-variable transition, and to correctly analyze the design trade-offs.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly based on the fundamental principles of digital logic design, specifically the analysis of combinational hazards. The definitions provided for static hazards and the consensus theorem are standard and correct. The circuit structure and the concept of unequal delays in reconvergent paths are central to hazard analysis. The proposed investigation—that fixing one type of hazard might introduce another—is a valid and important consideration in robust circuit design. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is clearly defined. It provides a specific Boolean function, a circuit implementation, and a set of standard assumptions (positive delays). The question asks for an analysis of a specific sequence of events: identifying a hazard, applying a standard fix, and analyzing the consequences of that fix under different conditions. The structure allows for a single, verifiable solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is technical, precise, and unambiguous. It relies on formal definitions and established theories, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. It is a valid problem in digital logic analysis. No flaws are detected. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis: (1) identification of a static-$1$ hazard in the original circuit, (2) analysis of the fix using the consensus term, and (3) analysis of any new glitches introduced by the fix.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Original Circuit for Static-$1$ Hazards**\nThe function is $F = A'B + AC$. For a static-$1$ hazard to exist in a sum-of-products (SOP) realization, there must be a single-variable transition between two input states (minterms) that both result in $F=1$, but which are covered by different product terms in the SOP expression.\n\nTo find such a transition, we can inspect the function's Karnaugh map. The minterms for which $F=1$ are:\n- For $A'B$: $m_2 (A'BC' = 010)$ and $m_3 (A'BC = 011)$.\n- For $AC$: $m_5 (AB'C = 101)$ and $m_7 (ABC = 111)$.\nSo, $F(A,B,C) = \\sum m(2, 3, 5, 7)$.\n\nThe Karnaugh map is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{1}{r}{A \\backslash BC}  \\multicolumn{1}{c}{00}  \\multicolumn{1}{c}{01}  \\multicolumn{1}{c}{11}  \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10} \\\\ \\hline\n0  0  0  1_{m3}  1_{m2} \\\\ \\hline\n1  0  1_{m5}  1_{m7}  0 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe groups for $F = A'B + AC$ cover $(m_2, m_3)$ and $(m_5, m_7)$, respectively. We look for adjacent $1$s that are in different groups. The minterms $m_3(011)$ and $m_7(111)$ are adjacent (they differ only in the variable $A$), but $m_3$ is covered by $A'B$ and $m_7$ is covered by $AC$. This uncovered adjacency is the source of a potential static-$1$ hazard.\n\nLet's consider the transition between these two states, e.g., $A$ changing from $0$ to $1$ while $B=1$ and $C=1$.\n- Initial state: $\\langle A,B,C \\rangle = \\langle 0,1,1 \\rangle$. $F = 0' \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 = 1$. The term $A'B$ is asserted.\n- Final state: $\\langle A,B,C \\rangle = \\langle 1,1,1 \\rangle$. $F = 1' \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 1$. The term $AC$ is asserted.\n\nDuring the $A: 0 \\to 1$ transition, the input $A$ fans out to two paths: one through an inverter to the first AND gate ($A'B$), and one directly to the second AND gate ($AC$). Due to propagation delays, the inverter will cause $A'$ to change from $1$ to $0$ after some delay. The first AND gate output ($A'B$) will fall to $0$. The second AND gate output ($AC$) will rise to $1$. If the path delay for $A'B$ to fall is shorter than the path delay for $AC$ to rise, there will be a momentary interval where both terms are $0$. The final OR gate will then output $0$, creating a $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$ glitch. This confirms a static-$1$ hazard exists for this transition.\n\n**2. Applying the Consensus Term to Fix the Hazard**\nThe product terms are $A'B$ and $AC$. Using the consensus theorem format $x'y + xz$, we have $x=A$, $y=B$, and $z=C$. The consensus term is $yz = BC$. Adding this logically redundant term gives the hazard-free function $F_{\\text{cons}} = A'B + AC + BC$.\n\nLet's re-analyze the transition $A: 0 \\to 1$ with $B=1$ and $C=1$ fixed.\n- With the new circuit, the output is $F_{\\text{cons}} = A'B + AC + BC$.\n- Throughout this transition, the inputs $B$ and $C$ are held at $1$.\n- Therefore, the added term $BC$ is constantly $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n- Since one input to the final OR gate is held at $1$, its output will remain solidy at $1$ regardless of the momentary values of $A'B$ and $AC$.\n- The static-$1$ hazard is therefore eliminated.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Modified Circuit for New Glitches**\nThe new circuit implements $F_{\\text{cons}} = A'B + AC + BC$. We must check for new glitches, particularly under multi-variable transitions where input skews are possible. Consider the transition from $\\langle A,B,C \\rangle = \\langle 0,0,1 \\rangle$ to $\\langle 1,1,0 \\rangle$.\n\n- **Ideal Function Behavior:** The endpoints must have the same output for a static glitch.\n- Start state $\\langle 0,0,1 \\rangle$: $F = 0' \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$.\n- End state $\\langle 1,1,0 \\rangle$: $F = 1' \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- The ideal function output is constantly $0$. If the circuit output temporarily becomes $1$, it is a static-$0$ glitch.\n\n- **Physical Circuit Behavior:** A glitch to $1$ occurs if any of the three terms $A'B$, $AC$, or $BC$ temporarily becomes $1$.\n- The transition involves $A: 0 \\to 1$, $B: 0 \\to 1$, and $C: 1 \\to 0$.\n- Let's analyze the new term, $BC$. It starts at $B \\cdot C = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$ and ends at $B \\cdot C = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- However, the input changes are not instantaneous. If the transition for $B$ (rising) is faster than the transition for $C$ (falling), there can be a time interval where the physical signals for both $B$ and $C$ are simultaneously high.\n- For example, if $B$ becomes $1$ before $C$ becomes $0$, the AND gate computing $BC$ will see two $1$s at its input. After its propagation delay, its output will become $1$, causing the final OR gate output to pulse to $1$. This is a static-$0$ glitch. This glitch is caused by the added consensus term $BC$.\n\n- **Original Terms:** One could create a timing scenario as described in Option A where the original terms $A'B$ and $AC$ do not produce a glitch, isolating the effect to the new $BC$ term. For instance, if $A$ changes from $0$ to $1$ sufficiently early, $A'$ will be $0$ before $B$ rises to $1$, preventing $A'B$ from pulsing. Similarly, if $C$ falls to $0$ before $A$ rises to $1$, $AC$ will not pulse.\n\n- **Balanced Covering:** The analysis shows that covering $1$-adjacencies to remove static-$1$ hazards is not sufficient for full robustness. To remove static-$0$ hazards in an SOP circuit, one must analyze the circuit for $F'$, which is equivalent to analyzing the product-of-sums (POS) form of $F$. A \"balanced\" approach ensures hazard-free operation for both $1$s and $0$s by ensuring all prime implicants are included in the SOP form and all prime implicates are included in the POS form.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Add the consensus term $BC$ to form $F_{\\text{cons}} = A'B + AC + BC$. This eliminates the static-$1$ hazard when only $A$ toggles from $A=0$ to $A=1$ with $B=1$ and $C=1$ fixed... Now consider the simultaneous transition from $\\langle A,B,C\\rangle = \\langle 0,0,1\\rangle$ to $\\langle 1,1,0\\rangle$... The endpoints satisfy $F=0$, but due to the overlap window with $B=1$ and $C=1$, the added $BC$ path asserts, producing a temporary $1$... a static-$0$ glitch... Trade-off: the consensus term improves robustness... but creates a new reconvergent condition... Balanced covering requires adding redundancy to cover both the $1$-adjacencies... and the complementary $0$-adjacencies...**\n- **Evaluation:** This option correctly identifies the static-$1$ hazard and the transition that causes it. It correctly states that adding the consensus term $BC$ resolves this specific hazard. It then correctly constructs a multi-input transition between two $0$-states and demonstrates how input skew can cause the new term $BC$ to create a static-$0$ glitch. The analysis of the trade-off and the conceptual explanation of balanced covering are also accurate. Every part of this statement is consistent with the principles of digital logic hazard analysis.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. In any two-level sum-of-products circuit built from primary inputs, adding a single consensus term cannot ever introduce a static-$0$ glitch, because consensus terms only fix hazards and never create new ones. Balanced covering is therefore unnecessary.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is false. The analysis for Option A provides a direct counterexample where adding the consensus term $BC$ introduces a static-$0$ glitch for a multi-input transition. The claim that consensus terms \"never create new ones\" is an incorrect oversimplification. While they solve static-1 hazards for single-input transitions, the new logic path can introduce other vulnerabilities, especially to multi-input skews.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Add $BC$ and then toggle only $B$ from $B=0$ to $B=1$ with $A=0$ and $C=0$ fixed. Because the endpoints give $F=0$ and $BC=0$ at all times, $F_{\\text{cons}}$ nonetheless produces a static-$0$ glitch, proving that consensus can introduce static-$0$ hazards. Balanced covering is achieved by removing $AC$ entirely and only using $A'B + BC$.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option contains multiple errors.\n    1. The proposed transition is from $\\langle 0,0,0 \\rangle$ to $\\langle 0,1,0 \\rangle$. For $F_{\\text{cons}} = A'B + AC + BC$, the output at $\\langle 0,0,0 \\rangle$ is $0' \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$, but the output at $\\langle 0,1,0 \\rangle$ is $0' \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 1$. This is a $0 \\to 1$ transition, not a static-$0$ transition. The premise \"the endpoints give $F=0$\" is false.\n    2. A two-level SOP circuit without feedback is incapable of producing a static-$0$ hazard for a single input change.\n    3. The suggestion that balanced covering is achieved by removing the $AC$ term is incorrect. The resulting function, $A'B + BC$, is not logically equivalent to the original function $F=A'B+AC$. For instance, at input $\\langle 1,0,1 \\rangle$, $F=1$ but $A'B+BC=0$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Without adding $BC$, both a static-$1$ hazard and a static-$0$ hazard are impossible in $F = A'B + AC$ under any input timing, because $A'B$ and $AC$ are disjoint terms. Balanced covering refers only to Karnaugh map grouping for minimization and does not affect hazards.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option is incorrect on multiple counts.\n    1. The claim that a static-$1$ hazard is impossible is false. As derived above, the adjacency between minterms $m_3$ and $m_7$ is not covered by a single term, leading to a classic static-$1$ hazard. Disjoint terms do not prevent this.\n    2. The statement that \"Balanced covering refers only to Karnaugh map grouping for minimization and does not affect hazards\" is the opposite of the truth. Including redundant prime implicants (which are often removed during minimization) is precisely the technique used to eliminate static hazards.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3647501"}]}
