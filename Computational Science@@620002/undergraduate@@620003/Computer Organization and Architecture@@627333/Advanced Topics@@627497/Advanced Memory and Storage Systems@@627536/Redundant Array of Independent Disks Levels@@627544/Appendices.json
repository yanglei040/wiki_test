{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Choosing a RAID level is a classic exercise in engineering trade-offs. This practice provides a foundational comparison between two popular configurations: RAID 6 (dual parity) and RAID 10 (striped mirrors). By deriving and comparing their space efficiencies, you will determine the point at which one becomes more advantageous than the other, gaining quantitative insight into the core conflict between storage capacity, cost, and fault tolerance [@problem_id:3675039].", "problem": "An array is built from $n$ identical disks, each of capacity $s$ bytes, managed by a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) controller. Define the space efficiency of a RAID configuration as the ratio of usable capacity to raw capacity. Using only core definitions of the relevant RAID levels, derive the space efficiency as a function of $n$ for the following configurations:\n- RAID 6, which uses two independent parity blocks per stripe and can tolerate any two disk failures.\n- RAID 10 (striped mirrors), which mirrors data pairwise and then stripes across the mirrored pairs.

It adheres to standard definitions within the field of computer science.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first deriving expressions for the space efficiency of RAID 6 and RAID 10 configurations, and then using these expressions to find the specified minimum number of disks.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of identical disks in the array, and let $s$ be the capacity of each disk in bytes.\n\nThe raw capacity, $C_{raw}$, of the array is the total capacity of all disks combined.\n$$C_{raw} = n \\times s$$\nSpace efficiency, $\\eta$, is defined as the ratio of usable capacity, $C_{usable}$, to raw capacity, $C_{raw}$.\n$$\\eta = \\frac{C_{usable}}{C_{raw}}$$\n\n**RAID 6 Space Efficiency**\nA RAID 6 array distributes data across $n$ disks. For each stripe of data, it computes and stores two independent parity blocks. This configuration can sustain the failure of any two disks. The storage of two parity blocks per stripe means that the capacity equivalent of two disks is dedicated to storing redundancy information, regardless of the total number of disks, $n$.\nThe number of disks available for data storage is effectively $n-2$.\nTherefore, the usable capacity for RAID 6, $C_{usable,6}$, is:\n$$C_{usable,6} = (n-2)s$$\nThe space efficiency for RAID 6, $\\eta_6(n)$, is the ratio of its usable capacity to the raw capacity.\n$$\\eta_6(n) = \\frac{C_{usable,6}}{C_{raw}} = \\frac{(n-2)s}{ns} = \\frac{n-2}{n}$$\nThis expression is valid for $n \\geq 4$, which is satisfied by the problem's constraint $n \\geq 6$.\n\n**RAID 10 Space Efficiency**\nA RAID 10 array, also known as RAID 1+0, is a \"stripe of mirrors\". Data is first mirrored onto pairs of disks, and then these mirrored pairs are striped. The problem specifies that $n$ is an even integer, ensuring that all disks can form complete mirrored pairs.\nA single mirrored pair consists of $2$ disks. The data is written to both disks, so the usable capacity of a pair of disks, each of capacity $s$, is only $s$.\nWith a total of $n$ disks, we can form $n/2$ such mirrored pairs.\nThese $n/2$ pairs are then striped. Striping does not add its own capacity overhead; it simply distributes data across the logical devices (the mirrored pairs). Thus, the total usable capacity of the RAID 10 array, $C_{usable,10}$, is the sum of the usable capacities of the mirrored pairs.\n$$C_{usable,10} = \\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)s$$\nThe space efficiency for RAID 10, $\\eta_{10}(n)$, is the ratio of its usable capacity to the raw capacity.\n$$\\eta_{10}(n) = \\frac{C_{usable,10}}{C_{raw}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)s}{ns} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe space efficiency of RAID 10 is a constant $1/2$, or $50\\%$, for any even number of disks $n \\geq 2$.\n\n**Comparison and Crossover Point**\nThe problem requires finding the minimum integer $n$ with $n \\geq 6$ for which RAID 6 is strictly more space-efficient than RAID 10. This can be expressed as the inequality:\n$$\\eta_6(n) > \\eta_{10}(n)$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\\frac{n-2}{n} > \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSince the problem specifies $n \\geq 6$, $n$ is a positive integer. We can multiply both sides of the inequality by $2n$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$2(n-2) > n$$\n$$2n - 4 > n$$\n$$n > 4$$\nThe problem asks for the minimum integer $n$ such that $n \\geq 6$ that satisfies this condition. The definition of the RAID 10 configuration provided is valid only for an even number of disks. Therefore, we must find the minimum even integer $n \\geq 6$ that satisfies $n > 4$. The set of even integers greater than or equal to $6$ is $\\{6, 8, 10, \\ldots\\}$. All members of this set satisfy the condition $n>4$. The minimum value in this set is $6$.\nLet's verify for $n=6$:\n$\\eta_6(6) = \\frac{6-2}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$\\eta_{10}(6) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe inequality $\\frac{2}{3} > \\frac{1}{2}$ is true, since $4 > 3$. Thus, for $n=6$, RAID 6 is strictly more space-efficient. Since $6$ is the smallest integer that meets all the problem's criteria ($n \\geq 6$, $n$ is even for the RAID 10 definition, and the inequality holds), it is the required answer.\n\n**Discussion of Characteristics**\nThe derived crossover point occurs at $n=5$, with RAID 6 becoming more space-efficient for any $n \\ge 5$. For the allowed even values of $n \\geq 6$, RAID 6 is always more space-efficient. The discussion focuses on the trade-offs that accompany this greater efficiency.\n\n- **Performance**: For large sequential operations (reads or writes), both RAID 6 and RAID 10 can utilize all $n$ disks, leading to high throughput. RAID 10 may have a slight advantage as it avoids the computational overhead of parity calculations. The most significant performance difference appears with small random writes. RAID 10 has a very low write penalty, requiring only two write operations per logical write (one to each disk in the mirror). In contrast, RAID 6 incurs a substantial write penalty due to its Read-Modify-Write cycle. Updating a single block requires reading the old data and both old parity blocks, then writing the new data and both new parity blocks, resulting in six I/O operations for one logical write. This write amplification makes RAID 10 far superior for random-write-intensive workloads.\n\n- **Fault Tolerance and Rebuild**: RAID 6 guarantees protection against any two disk failures, providing a higher level of data security. This is its primary advantage. Conversely, RAID 10 can tolerate at least one disk failure, but its ability to withstand multiple failures depends on which disks fail; if both disks in a single mirror fail, all data is lost. In the best-case scenario, RAID 10 can sustain up to $n/2$ failures, provided each failure occurs in a different mirrored pair. The rebuild process starkly contrasts the two. Rebuilding a failed drive in a RAID 10 array is fast and low-impact, as data is simply copied directly from the surviving mirror. A RAID 6 rebuild is a lengthy, resource-intensive process, requiring reading from all surviving $n-1$ disks to recalculate the missing data, which degrades array performance and increases the window of vulnerability to subsequent failures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "3675039"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static fault tolerance, the dynamic behavior of a RAID array during a rebuild is critical to its overall reliability.

For a Poisson process with rate $\\alpha$ over time $t$, the probability of zero events is $\\exp(-\\alpha t)$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the fields of computer architecture (RAID systems) and probability theory (Poisson processes). It is well-posed, with all necessary variables and relationships provided to find a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous. The provided numerical values ($n=8$, $C=10$ TB, etc.) are realistic for contemporary storage systems. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\n**1. Derivation of Expected Rebuild Time ($T_r$)**\n\nA RAID 5 array with $n$ disks stripes data and parity across all $n$ disks. When one disk fails, there are $n-1$ surviving disks. The lost data is reconstructed by reading the corresponding data and parity blocks from these $n-1$ disks.\n\nEach of the $n-1$ surviving disks contributes to the rebuild process. The total available rebuild bandwidth per disk is given as $B_r$. However, a fraction $\\phi$ of this bandwidth is consumed by a background workload. The remaining fraction available for the rebuild is $(1-\\phi)$.\nThe effective rebuild bandwidth from a single surviving disk, $B_{eff, disk}$, is:\n$$B_{eff, disk} = B_r (1-\\phi)$$\n\nAccording to the principle that the aggregate service rate is the sum of independent channel rates, the total aggregate rebuild bandwidth, $B_{agg}$, for the array is the sum of the effective bandwidths from all $n-1$ surviving disks:\n$$B_{agg} = (n-1) B_{eff, disk} = (n-1) B_r (1-\\phi)$$\n\nThe total workload is the amount of data that must be reconstructed, given as $C$. Using the principle that time equals workload divided by service rate, the expected rebuild time, $T_r$, is:\n$$T_r = \\frac{\\text{Workload}}{\\text{Service Rate}} = \\frac{C}{B_{agg}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $B_{agg}$, we obtain the final analytical expression for the rebuild time:\n$$T_r = \\frac{C}{(n-1) B_r (1-\\phi)}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Probability of an Additional Failure ($P_f$)**\n\nDisk failures are modeled as independent Poisson processes, each with a rate of $\\lambda$ failures per disk per year. For the $n-1$ surviving disks, the total failure rate, $\\lambda_{total}$, is the sum of the individual failure rates, because the sum of independent Poisson processes is also a Poisson process with a rate equal to the sum of the individual rates.\n$$\\lambda_{total} = (n-1)\\lambda$$\n\nWe are interested in the probability of at least one additional disk failure during the rebuild interval, $T_r$. It is simpler to first calculate the probability of zero additional failures, $P_0$, during this interval. Based on the provided principle for a Poisson process, the probability of observing zero events over a time $t$ for a process with rate $\\alpha$ is $\\exp(-\\alpha t)$.\nApplying this to our scenario:\n$$P_0 = \\exp(-\\lambda_{total} T_r)$$\n\nThe event \"at least one failure\" is the complement of the event \"zero failures\". Therefore, the probability $P_f$ is:\n$$P_f = 1 - P_0 = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{total} T_r)$$\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\lambda_{total}$ and $T_r$:\n$$P_f = 1 - \\exp\\left( -(n-1)\\lambda \\cdot \\frac{C}{(n-1) B_r (1-\\phi)} \\right)$$\nThe term $(n-1)$ in the exponent cancels out, leading to a simplified expression:\n$$P_f = 1 - \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\lambda C}{B_r (1-\\phi)} \\right)$$\nThis result reveals that, within this model, the probability of a second failure during a rebuild is independent of the number of disks in the array (for $n>1$).\n\n**3.

To ensure dimensional consistency in the exponent, we must express $\\lambda$ and the time component $\\frac{C}{B_r(1-\\phi)}$ in compatible units. Let's convert the failure rate $\\lambda$ to units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\\lambda_s = \\frac{0.02}{31,536,000}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe term in the exponent is:\n$$\\frac{\\lambda C}{B_r(1-\\phi)} = \\lambda_s \\times \\frac{C}{B_r(1-\\phi)} = \\frac{0.02}{31,536,000} \\times \\frac{10 \\times 10^{12}}{75 \\times 10^6 \\times 0.7}$$\n$$\\frac{\\lambda C}{B_r(1-\\phi)} = \\left( \\frac{0.02}{31,536,000} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{10^{13}}{5.25 \\times 10^7} \\right) \\approx (6.34245 \\times 10^{-10}) \\times (1.90476 \\times 10^5) \\approx 0.00012078$$\nThis exponent is also equal to $\\lambda_{total} \\times T_r$:\n$$\\lambda_{total} = (n-1)\\lambda_s = 7 \\times \\frac{0.02}{31,536,000}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 4.4397 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$\\lambda_{total} T_r \\approx (4.4397 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times (27210.884) \\approx 0.00012078$$\nThe probability of failure is then:\n$$P_f = 1 - \\exp(-0.00012078) \\approx 1 - 0.99987923 \\approx 0.00012077$$\nFor small $x$, $1 - \\exp(-x) \\approx x$.

We assume both rebuild windows have a duration of $T_r$.\n$$\\alpha_6(n) = (n\\lambda) \\times ((n-1)\\lambda T_r) \\times ((n-2)\\lambda T_r) = n(n-1)(n-2)\\lambda^3 T_r^2$$\n\nDurability constraint:\n$$\\alpha_6(n) \\le \\alpha_{\\text{max}}$$\n$$n(n-1)(n-2)\\lambda^3 T_r^2 \\le -\\ln(D)$$\n$$n(n-1)(n-2) \\le \\frac{-\\ln(D)}{\\lambda^3 T_r^2}$$\n\nLet's compute the value of the right-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{-\\ln(D)}{\\lambda^3 T_r^2} = \\frac{-\\ln(0.99999)}{(-\\ln(0.988))^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{182.625}\\right)^2} = \\frac{-(182.625)^2 \\ln(0.99999)}{(-\\ln(0.988))^3} $$\nUsing numerical values:\n$$ n(n-1)(n-2) \\le \\frac{-(182.625)^2 \\times (-1.000005 \\times 10^{-5})}{(-(-0.0120725))^3} \\approx \\frac{33351.5 \\times (1.000005 \\times 10^{-5})}{(0.0120725)^3} \\approx \\frac{0.333517}{1.7589 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 189616 $$\nSo, for RAID 6, we must satisfy two conditions:\n1. $n \\ge 12$ (Capacity)\n2. $n(n-1)(n-2) \\le 189616$ (Durability)\n\nWe need to find the minimum integer $n$ that satisfies both. We start by checking the lowest possible value of $n$ allowed by the capacity constraint, which is $n=12$.\nFor $n=12$:\n$$n(n-1)(n-2) = 12 \\times (12-1) \\times (12-2) = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 1320$$\nWe check if this satisfies the durability constraint:\n$$1320 \\le 189616$$\nThis inequality holds true.\nSince $n=12$ is the minimum value of $n$ satisfying the capacity constraint for RAID 6, and it also meets the durability constraint, $n=12$ is the minimum number of disks required for a valid a RAID 6 configuration.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nRAID level 5 is not a feasible solution as it cannot satisfy both the capacity and durability requirements for any number of disks.\nRAID level 6 is a feasible solution. The minimum number of disks required to meet the capacity constraint is $n=12$, and this configuration also meets the stringent durability requirement.\nTherefore, the minimal total number of disks $n$ that meets all constraints is $12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "3671415"}]}
