We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the constraint on the inverter sizing ratio $r = \\beta_{n}/\\beta_{p}$ that ensures read stability. The condition for read stability is given as $V_{R} \\le V_{M}$, where $V_{R}$ is the measured voltage disturbance on the storage node and $V_{M}$ is the switching threshold of the cross-coupled inverter. We will first derive an expression for $V_{M}$ and then apply the stability condition to find the constraint on $r$.\n\nThe inverter's switching threshold, $V_{M}$, is defined as the point on the voltage transfer characteristic where the input voltage equals the output voltage, $V_{\\text{in}} = V_{\\text{out}} = V_{M}$. At this operating point, the currents flowing through the n-channel MOSFET (nMOS) and p-channel MOSFET (pMOS) are equal, $I_{n} = I_{p}$. The problem states that both transistors operate in saturation.\n\nFor the nMOS transistor, the gate is connected to the input $V_{\\text{in}} = V_{M}$ and the source is connected to ground ($0\\ \\mathrm{V}$). Thus, its gate-to-source voltage is $V_{GS,n} = V_{M}$. The saturation current is given by:\n$$I_{n} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{n}(V_{GS,n}-V_{THn})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{n}(V_{M}-V_{THn})^{2}$$\n\nFor the pMOS transistor, the gate is also connected to the input $V_{\\text{in}} = V_{M}$ and the source is connected to the supply voltage $V_{DD}$. Thus, its source-to-gate voltage is $V_{SG,p} = V_{DD} - V_{M}$. The saturation current is given by:\n$$I_{p} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}(V_{SG,p}-|V_{THp}|)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}(V_{DD}-V_{M}-|V_{THp}|)^{2}$$\n\nWe are given that the threshold voltages are equal in magnitude, $V_{THn} = |V_{THp}| = V_{TH}$. Setting $I_{n} = I_{p}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{n}(V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}(V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2}$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{p}$ and substituting the definition of the sizing ratio $r = \\beta_{n}/\\beta_{p}$, we obtain:\n$$r(V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2} = (V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2}$$\n\nSolving for $r$ yields the sizing ratio as a function of the switching threshold $V_{M}$:\n$$r = \\frac{(V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2}}{(V_{M}-V_{TH})^{2}} = \\left( \\frac{V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH}}{V_{M}-V_{TH}} \\right)^{2}$$\nThis equation is valid for $V_{TH} < V_{M} < V_{DD}-V_{TH}$, which ensures both transistors are in saturation and the arguments of the squares are positive.\n\nThe read stability condition is $V_{R} \\le V_{M}$. To ensure stability, the inverter's switching threshold $V_{M}$ must be greater than or equal to the disturbance voltage $V_{R}$. We examine the relationship between $r$ and $V_{M}$. The numerator $(V_{DD}-V_{M}-V_{TH})$ is a decreasing function of $V_{M}$, while the denominator $(V_{M}-V_{TH})$ is an increasing function of $V_{M}$. Therefore, their ratio, and consequently $r$, is a strictly decreasing function of $V_{M}$. This means that to achieve a higher switching threshold $V_{M}$, a smaller sizing ratio $r$ is required.\n\nThe condition $V_{M} \\ge V_{R}$ is thus equivalent to requiring that the cell's sizing ratio $r$ be less than or equal to the sizing ratio calculated at the limiting case where $V_{M} = V_{R}$. Let this limiting value be $r^{\\star}$.\n$$r \\le r^{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{V_{DD}-V_{R}-V_{TH}}{V_{R}-V_{TH}} \\right)^{2}$$\nThis is the general condition on $r$ required to avoid a read disturb.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values as requested.\n\nFirst, for the nominal threshold voltage $V_{TH} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The other parameters are $V_{DD}=1.0\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{R}=0.35\\ \\mathrm{V}$.

The new threshold voltage is $V_{TH, \\text{new}} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V} + 0.05\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{V}$. All other parameters remain unchanged. The new limiting value $r^{\\star}_{\\text{new}}$ is:\n$$r^{\\star}_{\\text{new}} = \\left( \\frac{1.0 - 0.35 - 0.30}{0.35 - 0.30} \\right)^{2} = \\left( \\frac{0.35}{0.05} \\right)^{2} = (7)^{2} = 49$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $r^{\\star}_{\\text{new}} = 49.0$.\n\nThe two limiting values for the sizing ratio $r$, corresponding to the nominal and increased threshold voltages, are $16.0$ and $49.0$, respectively.
