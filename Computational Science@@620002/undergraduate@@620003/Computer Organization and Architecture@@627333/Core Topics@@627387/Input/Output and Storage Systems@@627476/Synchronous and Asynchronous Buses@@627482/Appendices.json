You are tasked with modeling an on-chip performance counter that estimates the average number of bus clock cycles per data transfer on the synchronous bus and comparing it to the average handshake duration on the asynchronous bus under workload variability.\n\nAssume the following operational definitions and conditions:\n\n- On the synchronous bus, each transfer consists of an address phase followed by a data phase. The bus samples data only on clock boundaries. If the device’s service time exceeds the time until the next sampling boundary, the bus inserts wait states until a sampling boundary occurs at or after the service completion. The performance counter records the total number of bus clock cycles that were spent actively performing transfers over a long observation window and the total number of completed transfers.\n\n- On the asynchronous bus, a classical four-phase request–acknowledge handshake is used: request asserted, acknowledge asserted, request deasserted, acknowledge deasserted. Each control transition incurs a fixed propagation delay. The acknowledge is not asserted until the device completes its service.\n\n- The device service time is a random variable modeling workload variability: with probability $p$, the service time equals $x_{f}$ (fast case), and with probability $1 - p$, it equals $x_{s}$ (slow case). The same service time variability applies on both buses.\n\nYou are given the following parameters:\n\n- Synchronous bus clock frequency $f = 200$ megahertz.\n- Control-signal propagation delay per transition on the asynchronous bus $t_{p} = 1$ nanosecond.\n- Fast service time $x_{f} = 7$ nanoseconds.\n- Slow service time $x_{s} = 19$ nanoseconds.\n- Fast-case probability $p = 0.7$.\n\nUsing only first-principles definitions of the synchronous transfer timing and the four-phase asynchronous handshake timeline:\n\n1.

The analysis must be based on first principles. The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, thus it is valid. We proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Synchronous bus clock frequency, $f = 200 \\times 10^6$ Hz.\n- Asynchronous bus control-signal propagation delay per transition, $t_p = 1 \\times 10^{-9}$ s.\n- Fast service time, $x_f = 7 \\times 10^{-9}$ s.\n- Slow service time, $x_s = 19 \\times 10^{-9}$ s.\n- Probability of a fast service time, $p = 0.7$.\n\nThe service time, $x$, is a random variable with probability mass function $P(x=x_f) = p$ and $P(x=x_s) = 1-p$.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Synchronous Bus**\n\nFirst, we determine the clock period, $T_{clk}$, of the synchronous bus.\n$$T_{clk} = \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{200 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Hz}} = 5 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s} = 5 \\text{ ns}$$\n\nA transfer on the synchronous bus consists of an address phase and a data phase. A standard and minimal model for such a protocol assumes the address phase takes one clock cycle. The device service, of duration $x$, starts after the address is issued. The data can only be sampled at a rising clock edge. Therefore, wait states are inserted until the first clock edge that occurs at or after the service is complete.\n\nLet a transfer start at time $t=0$. The address phase consumes one clock cycle, so it ends at time $t=T_{clk}$. The service of duration $x$ begins at this point, and the data becomes available at time $T_{clk} + x$. The total duration of the transfer must be an integer number of clock cycles, $C_{sync}(x)$, such that the total time, $C_{sync}(x) \\cdot T_{clk}$, is at least $T_{clk} + x$.\n$$C_{sync}(x) \\cdot T_{clk} \\ge T_{clk} + x$$\nThe number of cycles is the smallest integer satisfying this condition, which is found using the ceiling function:\n$$C_{sync}(x) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{T_{clk} + x}{T_{clk}} \\right\\rceil = 1 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{x}{T_{clk}} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nWe apply this model to the two service time cases:\nFor the fast case ($x_f = 7 \\text{ ns}$):\n$$C_{sync}(x_f) = 1 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{7 \\text{ ns}}{5 \\text{ ns}} \\right\\rceil = 1 + \\lceil 1.4 \\rceil = 1 + 2 = 3 \\text{ cycles}$$\nFor the slow case ($x_s = 19 \\text{ ns}$):\n$$C_{sync}(x_s) = 1 + \\left\\lceil \\frac{19 \\text{ ns}}{5 \\text{ ns}} \\right\\rceil = 1 + \\lceil 3.8 \\rceil = 1 + 4 = 5 \\text{ cycles}$$\n\nThe expected number of clock cycles per transfer, $E[C_{sync}]$, is the weighted average of the cycles for the fast and slow cases.\n$$E[C_{sync}] = p \\cdot C_{sync}(x_f) + (1-p) \\cdot C_{sync}(x_s)$$\n$$E[C_{sync}] = (0.7)(3) + (1-0.7)(5) = (0.7)(3) + (0.3)(5) = 2.1 + 1.5 = 3.6$$\nThis is the answer to the first part of the problem.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Asynchronous Bus**\n\nThe asynchronous bus uses a four-phase handshake protocol. The duration of this handshake, $T_{async}(x)$, for a given service time $x$ can be determined by summing the delays of each phase:\n1. The master asserts the request signal. It takes a time $t_p$ to propagate to the slave.\n2. The slave receives the request, performs the service (duration $x$), and then asserts the acknowledge signal.\n3. The acknowledge signal propagates back to the master, which takes another $t_p$.\n4. The master receives the acknowledge and deasserts the request. This signal propagates to the slave in $t_p$.\n5. The slave receives the deasserted request and deasserts the acknowledge. This signal travels back to the master in $t_p$.\nThe total duration of the handshake is the sum of the service time and the four propagation delays.\n$$T_{async}(x) = x + 4t_p$$\n\nWe apply this model to the two service time cases with $t_p = 1 \\text{ ns}$:\nFor the fast case ($x_f = 7 \\text{ ns}$):\n$$T_{async}(x_f) = 7 \\text{ ns} + 4(1 \\text{ ns}) = 11 \\text{ ns}$$\nFor the slow case ($x_s = 19 \\text{ ns}$):\n$$T_{async}(x_s) = 19 \\text{ ns} + 4(1 \\text{ ns}) = 23 \\text{ ns}$$\n\nThe expected handshake duration, $E[T_{async}]$, is the weighted average.\n$$E[T_{async}] = p \\cdot T_{async}(x_f) + (1-p) \\cdot T_{async}(x_s)$$\n$$E[T_{async}] = (0.7)(11 \\text{ ns}) + (0.3)(23 \\text{ ns}) = 7.7 \\text{ ns} + 6.9 \\text{ ns} = 14.6 \\text{ ns}$$\nThis is the answer to the second part of the problem.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Ratio R**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the asynchronous bus's expected handshake duration to the synchronous bus's expected transfer time in seconds.\nThe numerator is $E[T_{async}] = 14.6 \\text{ ns}$.\n\nThe denominator is the expected transfer time on the synchronous bus, $E[T_{sync}]$. The time for a synchronous transfer with service time $x$ is $T_{sync}(x) = C_{sync}(x) \\cdot T_{clk}$. The expected time is:\n$$E[T_{sync}] = E[C_{sync}(x) \\cdot T_{clk}]$$\nSince $T_{clk}$ is a constant, we can write:\n$$E[T_{sync}] = E[C_{sync}] \\cdot T_{clk}$$\nUsing the result from Part 1, $E[C_{sync}] = 3.6$, and $T_{clk} = 5 \\text{ ns}$:\n$$E[T_{sync}] = 3.6 \\cdot 5 \\text{ ns} = 18 \\text{ ns}$$\n\nNow we can compute the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{E[T_{async}]}{E[T_{sync}]} = \\frac{14.6 \\text{ ns}}{18 \\text{ ns}} = \\frac{14.6}{18}$$\n\nTo express this as a simplified exact fraction, we convert the decimal to a fraction:\n$$R = \\frac{146}{180}$$\nWe simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$R = \\frac{146 \\div 2}{180 \\div 2} = \\frac{73}{90}$$\nSince $73$ is a prime number and does not divide $90$, the fraction is fully simplified.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{73}{90}}$$", "id": "3683502"}, {"introduction": "Building on performance, this exercise shifts focus to energy efficiency, a critical factor in modern chip design.

Derive the energy drawn from the power supply for a single $0 \\to 1$ bit transition based on first principles.\n2.  Formulate the expected energy per word transfer for both the synchronous and asynchronous regimes using the concept of an activity factor.\n3.  Calculate the ratio of the asynchronous energy to the synchronous energy.\n\n**Step 1: Energy for a Single Bit Transition**\nThe problem asks to consider the energy transfer when charging a capacitor through a resistive path. Let a single bit line be modeled as a capacitor of capacitance $C_{\\ell}$. A $0 \\to 1$ transition corresponds to charging this capacitor from an initial voltage of $0$ to the supply voltage $V$. The charging occurs from the voltage supply $V$ through the pull-up network, which has some effective resistance $R$.\n\nThe instantaneous current flowing from the supply during charging is $i(t)$. The instantaneous power drawn from the supply is $P(t) = V i(t)$. The total energy drawn from the supply, $E_{\\text{supply}}$, is the integral of this power over the entire charging duration (from $t=0$ to $t \\to \\infty$):\n$$E_{\\text{supply}} = \\int_0^\\infty P(t) \\,dt = \\int_0^\\infty V i(t) \\,dt$$\nSince the supply voltage $V$ is constant, we can write:\n$$E_{\\text{supply}} = V \\int_0^\\infty i(t) \\,dt$$\nThe integral of the current over time is the total charge $Q$ that flows from the supply to the capacitor to charge it to voltage $V$. The charge stored on a capacitor is given by $Q = C_{\\ell}V$.\nSubstituting this into the energy equation, we get:\n$$E_{\\text{supply}} = V Q = V(C_{\\ell}V) = C_{\\ell}V^2$$\nThis is the total energy drawn from the power supply for one $0 \\to 1$ transition on a single bit line. It is a fundamental result that half of this energy, $\\frac{1}{2}C_{\\ell}V^2$, is stored in the capacitor, and the other half is dissipated as heat in the resistive path.\n\nFor a $1 \\to 0$ transition, the capacitor $C_{\\ell}$ discharges to ground through the pull-down network. The stored energy, $\\frac{1}{2}C_{\\ell}V^2$, is dissipated as heat in the pull-down transistors. No energy is drawn from the supply $V$ during this process.\nFor $0 \\to 0$ and $1 \\to 1$ transitions, the capacitor voltage does not change, and thus no dynamic energy is consumed.\nTherefore, dynamic energy is drawn from the supply only during $0 \\to 1$ transitions.\n\n**Step 2: Expected Energy per Word**\nThe total energy drawn from the supply per word transfer depends on the expected number of bit lines that transition from $0$ to $1$.\nLet $\\alpha$ be the activity factor, defined as the expected fraction of bit positions that undergo a $0 \\to 1$ transition between successive words. This is equivalent to the probability of a single bit line transitioning from $0$ to $1$.\nFor a bus of width $w$, the expected number of $0 \\to 1$ transitions per word transfer, $N_{0 \\to 1}$, is:\n$$N_{0 \\to 1} = w \\alpha$$\nThe total expected energy drawn from the supply per word, $E_{\\text{word}}$, is the product of the expected number of $0 \\to 1$ transitions and the energy per transition:\n$$E_{\\text{word}} = N_{0 \\to 1} \\times E_{\\text{supply}} = (w \\alpha) (C_{\\ell}V^2) = w \\alpha C_{\\ell}V^2$$\n\n**Synchronous Regime:**\nIn the synchronous regime, successive words are independent, and each bit is equally likely to be $0$ or $1$.

Due to independence:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{sync}} = P(b_{t-1}=0 \\text{ and } b_t=1) = P(b_{t-1}=0) \\times P(b_t=1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\nThe expected energy per word in the synchronous regime is:\n$$E_{\\text{sync}} = w \\alpha_{\\text{sync}} C_{\\ell}V^2 = w (0.25) C_{\\ell}V^2$$\n\n**Asynchronous Regime:**\nIn the asynchronous regime, the activity factor $\\alpha_{\\text{async}}$ is given directly in the problem statement as a parameter reflecting sparse data activity.\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{async}} = 0.05$$\nThe expected energy per word in the asynchronous regime is:\n$$E_{\\text{async}} = w \\alpha_{\\text{async}} C_{\\ell}V^2 = w (0.05) C_{\\ell}V^2$$\n\n**Step 3: Ratio of Energies**\nThe problem requires the evaluation of the ratio $R = \\frac{E_{\\text{async}}}{E_{\\text{sync}}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{w \\alpha_{\\text{async}} C_{\\ell}V^2}{w \\alpha_{\\text{sync}} C_{\\ell}V^2}$$\nThe terms for bus width ($w$), line capacitance ($C_{\\ell}$), and supply voltage ($V$) cancel out. The ratio depends only on the activity factors of the two regimes.\n$$R = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{async}}}{\\alpha_{\\text{sync}}}$$\nSubstituting the values for the activity factors:\n$$R = \\frac{0.05}{0.25} = \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\nThe specific numerical values for $w$, $C_{\\ell}$, and $V$ are not required to calculate the final ratio, as they are identical for both regimes and thus cancel out.
