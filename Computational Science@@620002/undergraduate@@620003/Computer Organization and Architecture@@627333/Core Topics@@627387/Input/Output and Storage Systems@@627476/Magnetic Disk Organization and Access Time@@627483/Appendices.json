A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe mean service time for a single-block disk request, $T_{\\text{service}}$, is modeled as the sum of three independent components: the mechanical seek time, $T_{\\text{seek}}$, the rotational latency, $T_{\\text{rotation}}$, and the data transfer time, $T_{\\text{transfer}}$.\n$$T_{\\text{service}} = T_{\\text{seek}} + T_{\\text{rotation}} + T_{\\text{transfer}}$$\nThe problem asks for the average mechanical seek time for a random single-block read, which we denote as $T_{\\text{seek, rand}}$. From the random read experiment, we are given the total mean service time, $T_{\\text{service, rand}} = 12.20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$T_{\\text{service, rand}} = T_{\\text{seek, rand}} + T_{\\text{rotation, avg}} + T_{\\text{transfer, block}}$$\nTo find $T_{\\text{seek, rand}}$, we must first calculate the average rotational latency, $T_{\\text{rotation, avg}}$, and the transfer time for a single block, $T_{\\text{transfer, block}}$.\n\n**1. Calculate Average Rotational Latency ($T_{\\text{rotation, avg}}$)**\nThe disk's spindle speed is given as $S = 7200\\,\\mathrm{RPM}$ (revolutions per minute). The time for one full revolution, $T_{\\text{rev}}$, is the inverse of the rotational speed (expressed in revolutions per second).\n$$S = 7200\\,\\frac{\\text{rev}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{min}}{60\\,\\text{s}} = 120\\,\\frac{\\text{rev}}{\\text{s}}$$\n$$T_{\\text{rev}} = \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1}{120}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nFor a random request, the read/write head must wait for the desired sector to rotate into position. On average, this wait time is half of one full revolution.\n$$T_{\\text{rotation, avg}} = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\text{rev}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{120}\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1}{240}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nConverting this time to milliseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{ms}$):\n$$T_{\\text{rotation, avg}} = \\frac{1000}{240}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{100}{24}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{25}{6}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n\n**2. Calculate Single-Block Transfer Time ($T_{\\text{transfer, block}}$)**\nThe problem states that for a long sequential scan, the per-block service time approaches the pure data transfer time because the seek time and rotational latency are amortized over a large number of contiguous blocks. We can therefore use the sustained sequential throughput, $R_{\\text{seq}}$, to determine the time required to transfer a single block of size $B$.\nThe givens are:\n- Sustained throughput, $R_{\\text{seq}} = 160\\,\\mathrm{MiB/s}$\n- Block size, $B = 4\\,\\mathrm{KiB}$\n\nWe must use consistent units, where $1\\,\\mathrm{MiB} = 2^{20}\\,\\mathrm{bytes}$ and $1\\,\\mathrm{KiB} = 2^{10}\\,\\mathrm{bytes}$.\n$$R_{\\text{seq}} = 160 \\times 2^{20}\\,\\mathrm{bytes/s}$$\n$$B = 4 \\times 2^{10}\\,\\mathrm{bytes}$$\nThe transfer time for one block is the block size divided by the transfer rate:\n$$T_{\\text{transfer, block}} = \\frac{B}{R_{\\text{seq}}} = \\frac{4 \\times 2^{10}\\,\\mathrm{bytes}}{160 \\times 2^{20}\\,\\mathrm{bytes/s}} = \\frac{4}{160} \\times \\frac{2^{10}}{2^{20}}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$T_{\\text{transfer, block}} = \\frac{1}{40} \\times 2^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1}{40 \\times 1024}\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1}{40960}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nConverting to milliseconds:\n$$T_{\\text{transfer, block}} = \\frac{1000}{40960}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{100}{4096}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{25}{1024}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n\n**3. Infer Average Mechanical Seek Time ($T_{\\text{seek, rand}}$)**\nNow we can rearrange the service time equation to solve for $T_{\\text{seek, rand}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{seek, rand}} = T_{\\text{service, rand}} - T_{\\text{rotation, avg}} - T_{\\text{transfer, block}}$$\nSubstituting the given and calculated values:\n$$T_{\\text{seek, rand}} = 12.20\\,\\mathrm{ms} - \\frac{25}{6}\\,\\mathrm{ms} - \\frac{25}{1024}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we convert the fractions to their decimal representations:\n$$T_{\\text{rotation, avg}} = \\frac{25}{6}\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\approx 4.166667\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n$$T_{\\text{transfer, block}} = \\frac{25}{1024}\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\approx 0.024414\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nNow, we compute the final value:\n$$T_{\\text{seek, rand}} \\approx 12.20 - 4.166667 - 0.024414\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n$$T_{\\text{seek, rand}} \\approx 8.008919\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $0$, $0$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, so we round up the fourth.\n$$T_{\\text{seek, rand}} \\approx 8.009\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThis is the inferred average mechanical seek time for a random single-block read.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.009}\n$$", "id": "3655544"}, {"introduction": "Every I/O request consists of two main phases: positioning (seek and rotation) and data transfer.

The problem specifies the model:\n$$T_{\\text{service}} = t_{\\text{seek}} + t_{\\text{rot}} + t_{\\text{xfer}}$$\nwhere $t_{\\text{seek}}$ is the average seek time, $t_{\\text{rot}}$ is the average rotational latency, and $t_{\\text{xfer}}$ is the transfer time.\n\n1.  **Average Seek Time ($t_{\\text{seek}}$):** This is given as $t_{\\text{seek}} = 9.0\\,\\text{ms}$. It is the same for both disks.\n\n2.  **Average Rotational Latency ($t_{\\text{rot}}$):** The problem states that the arrival of a request is uniformly distributed with respect to the platter's angular position. This implies the rotational waiting time before the desired data is positioned under the read/write head is a random variable uniformly distributed over the interval $[0, T_{\\text{rev}}]$. The expected value (average) of a random variable uniformly distributed on $[a, b]$ is $\\frac{a+b}{2}$.

The disk reads $D_{\\text{rev}}$ bytes of data in one full revolution time, $T_{\\text{rev}}$. The time to read a smaller block of size $S_{\\text{block}}$ is proportional to the fraction of the revolution it occupies.

For a large, contiguous read, the initial positioning overhead (seek and latency) is amortized to a negligible value. The throughput is then limited only by the media transfer rate. In one revolution, an amount of data $D_{\\text{rev}}$ is read in time $T_{\\text{rev}}$.
