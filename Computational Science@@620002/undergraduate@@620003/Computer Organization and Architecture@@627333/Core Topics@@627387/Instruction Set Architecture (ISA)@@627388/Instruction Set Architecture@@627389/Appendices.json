We must find the smallest integer $k_{\\text{br}}-1$ such that $2^{k_{\\text{br}}-1} \\ge 139.156$.\nWe know $2^7=128$ and $2^8=256$.\nSo, we must have $k_{\\text{br}}-1 \\ge 8$, which implies $k_{\\text{br}} \\ge 9$. The smallest integer value is $k_{\\text{br}}=9$.\n\nLet's check this result.\nFor $k_{\\text{br}}=8$, the range is $[-128, 127]$. The symmetric range is $|D| \\le 127$.\n$P(|D| \\le 127) = 1 - \\exp(-127/20) = 1 - \\exp(-6.35) \\approx 1 - 0.001747 = 0.998253$.\nSince $0.998253 < 0.999$, $k_{\\text{br}}=8$ is insufficient.\n\nFor $k_{\\text{br}}=9$, the range is $[-256, 255]$. The symmetric range is $|D| \\le 255$.\n$P(|D| \\le 255) = 1 - \\exp(-255/20) = 1 - \\exp(-12.75) \\approx 1 - 2.895 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.999997$.\nSince $0.999997 \\ge 0.999$, $k_{\\text{br}}=9$ is sufficient.\nThus, the smallest integer value is $k_{\\text{br}} = 9$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculate the spill frequency**\n\nThe original width is $k_{\\text{add}}=13$.

The possible starting offsets $k$ that cause a crossing are $\\{57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63\\}$. There are $7$ such starting offsets.\n\nThe problem specifies that an access is \"unaligned\" if its starting address is not a multiple of $8$. Within a $64$-byte line, the aligned offsets are multiples of $8$: $\\{0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56\\}$. There are $64/8 = 8$ aligned offsets. The total number of possible starting offsets is $64$. Thus, the number of unaligned starting offsets is $64 - 8 = 56$.\n\nThe problem states that the starting byte offset of an unaligned access is uniformly distributed over the set of these $56$ unaligned offsets. We must determine how many of the $7$ crossing offsets are also unaligned. The crossing offsets are $\\{57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63\\}$. None of these values are multiples of $8$, so all $7$ crossing offsets are unaligned.\n\nTherefore, the probability $P_{cross}$ that a random unaligned access crosses a cache-line boundary is the ratio of the number of unaligned crossing offsets to the total number of unaligned offsets:\n$$P_{cross} = \\frac{\\text{Number of unaligned crossing offsets}}{\\text{Total number of unaligned offsets}} = \\frac{7}{56} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n\n**2. Average Memory Operation Cost Functions**\n\nLet $C_1(f)$ and $C_2(f)$ be the expected average cycles per memory operation for the \"trap-on-unaligned\" and \"hardware support\" designs, respectively, as a function of the unaligned fraction $f$. The total population of memory operations consists of a fraction $(1-f)$ of aligned operations and a fraction $f$ of unaligned operations.\n\n**Design 1: Trap-on-unaligned ($C_1(f)$)**\n- Cost of an aligned operation: $L = 4$ cycles.\n- Cost of an unaligned operation: This triggers a trap. The total cost is the sum of the trap overhead, the handler execution time, and the pipeline refill cost. The handler itself performs two aligned memory operations, each costing $L$, plus software overhead $M_s$.\n$$ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{unaligned}} = T + (2L + M_s) + R $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{unaligned}} = 180 + (2 \\times 4 + 6) + 15 = 180 + 8 + 6 + 15 = 209 \\text{ cycles} $$\nThe average cost $C_1(f)$ is the weighted average of the aligned and unaligned costs:\n$$ C_1(f) = (1-f) \\times \\text{Cost}_{\\text{aligned}} + f \\times \\text{Cost}_{\\text{unaligned}} $$\n$$ C_1(f) = (1-f) \\times 4 + f \\times 209 = 4 - 4f + 209f $$\n$$ C_1(f) = 4 + 205f $$\n\n**Design 2: Hardware support ($C_2(f)$)**\n- An alignment-handling stage adds $a=1$ cycle to every memory operation.\n- Cost of an aligned operation: The base latency plus the alignment stage cost:\n$$ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{aligned}} = L + a = 4 + 1 = 5 \\text{ cycles} $$\n- Cost of an unaligned operation: This depends on whether a cache-line boundary is crossed.\n  - If no crossing (with probability $1 - P_{cross} = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8$): The access is handled by fetching from a single cache line. The problem description distinguishes this from the cross-boundary case, where latency is explicitly $2L$. For a non-crossing access, it can be served by a single cache access of latency $L$. The total cost is composed of the alignment stage, the base L1 access, and the merging overhead.\n    $$ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{no-cross}} = L + a + b = 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 \\text{ cycles} $$\n  - If crossing (with probability $P_{cross} = 1/8$): The operation requires sequential accesses to two cache lines, with a specified base latency of $2L$, plus the alignment stage and merge/control overhead.\n    $$ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{cross}} = 2L + a + c = 2 \\times 4 + 1 + 3 = 8 + 1 + 3 = 12 \\text{ cycles} $$\nThe expected cost of an unaligned operation in this design is:\n$$ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{unaligned}} = (1 - P_{cross}) \\times \\text{Cost}_{\\text{no-cross}} + P_{cross} \\times \\text{Cost}_{\\text{cross}} $$\n$$ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{unaligned}} = \\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right) \\times 7 + \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\times 12 = \\frac{49}{8} + \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{61}{8} = 7.625 \\text{ cycles} $$\nThe average cost $C_2(f)$ is the weighted average of the aligned and unaligned costs:\n$$ C_2(f) = (1-f) \\times \\text{Cost}_{\\text{aligned}} + f \\times \\text{Cost}_{\\text{unaligned}} $$\n$$ C_2(f) = (1-f) \\times 5 + f \\times 7.625 = 5 - 5f + 7.625f $$\n$$ C_2(f) = 5 + 2.625f $$\n\n**3. Break-even Unaligned Fraction ($f^{\\star}$)**\n\nThe break-even fraction $f^{\\star}$ is the value of $f$ for which the two designs have equal performance, i.e., $C_1(f^{\\star}) = C_2(f^{\\star})$.\n$$ 4 + 205f^{\\star} = 5 + 2.625f^{\\star} $$\nTo solve for $f^{\\star}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ 205f^{\\star} - 2.625f^{\\star} = 5 - 4 $$\n$$ 202.375f^{\\star} = 1 $$\n$$ f^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{202.375} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ f^{\\star} \\approx 0.004941334 $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ f^{\\star} \\approx 0.004941 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.004941}\n$$", "id": "3650322"}]}
