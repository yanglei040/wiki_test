All necessary data ($S_{0}$, $S_{u}$, $S_{d}$, $R_{f}$, and derivative payoffs) are provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nA critical condition for the absence of arbitrage in a one-period binomial model is that the risk-free return must lie strictly between the returns of the underlying asset in the up and down states.

Therefore, a unique risk-neutral probability measure exists, and the problem is well-posed and admits a unique arbitrage-free price.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nThe arbitrage-free price of a derivative in a complete market, such as the one described, is found by calculating the expected value of its future payoffs under the risk-neutral probability measure, and then discounting this expectation to the present time using the risk-free rate.\n\nFirst, we must determine the risk-neutral probabilities. Let $q_{d}$ be the risk-neutral probability of the \"down\" state (the downgrade event) and $q_{u}$ be the risk-neutral probability of the \"up\" state. By definition, $q_{u} + q_{d} = 1$.\n\nThe fundamental principle of risk-neutral valuation dictates that the expected return of any asset under the risk-neutral measure must equal the risk-free rate. Applying this to the equity index $S$, its price at time $t=0$ must be the discounted expected value of its price at time $t=1$:\n$$S_{0} = \\frac{1}{R_{f}} (q_{u} S_{u} + q_{d} S_{d})$$\nSubstituting $q_{u} = 1 - q_{d}$ into this equation gives:\n$$S_{0} R_{f} = (1 - q_{d}) S_{u} + q_{d} S_{d}$$\n$$S_{0} R_{f} = S_{u} - q_{d} S_{u} + q_{d} S_{d}$$\nWe solve for $q_{d}$:\n$$q_{d} (S_{u} - S_{d}) = S_{u} - S_{0} R_{f}$$\n$$q_{d} = \\frac{S_{u} - S_{0} R_{f}}{S_{u} - S_{d}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numeric values provided in the problem:\n- $S_{u} = 110$\n- $S_{d} = 90$\n- $S_{0} = 100$\n- $R_{f} = 1.02$\n\n$$q_{d} = \\frac{110 - (100 \\times 1.02)}{110 - 90} = \\frac{110 - 102}{20} = \\frac{8}{20} = 0.4$$\nThe risk-neutral probability of a downgrade is $q_{d} = 0.4$. The probability of no downgrade is $q_{u} = 1 - q_{d} = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$.\n\nLet $C_{0}$ be the arbitrage-free price of the credit derivative at time $t=0$. Its payoff at time $t=1$ is $C_{1,d} = 1$ in the down state and $C_{1,u} = 0$ in the up state. The price $C_{0}$ is the discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure:\n$$C_{0} = \\frac{1}{R_{f}} (q_{u} C_{1,u} + q_{d} C_{1,d})$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$C_{0} = \\frac{1}{1.02} ((0.6 \\times 0) + (0.4 \\times 1))$$\n$$C_{0} = \\frac{0.4}{1.02}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$C_{0} \\approx 0.39215686...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The solution will be derived using the principle of risk-neutral valuation within a single-period binomial framework.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe given parameters are:\n- Initial asset price: $S_0 = \\$100$.\n- Up-factor without policy: $u = 1.2$.\n- Down-factor without policy: $d = 0.7$.\n- Gross risk-free return: $R = 1.05$.\n- Option strike price: $K = \\$100$.\n- Government price floor: $L = \\$90$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the standard binomial model of asset pricing, a cornerstone of financial engineering. The introduction of a government price floor is a well-defined modification to the asset's terminal payoffs.\n\nBefore the policy, the no-arbitrage condition $d < R < u$ must hold. With $d=0.7$, $R=1.05$, and $u=1.2$, we have $0.7 < 1.05 < 1.2$, which is true. The initial model is valid.\n\nThe policy modifies the terminal asset prices at time $t=1$.

To ensure a unique no-arbitrage price exists, we must check the no-arbitrage condition for the *new* effective up and down factors. The new factors are $u' = S_1(u)/S_0 = \\$120/\\$100 = 1.2$ and $d' = S_1(d)/S_0 = \\$90/\\$100 = 0.9$. The condition $d' < R < u'$ becomes $0.9 < 1.05 < 1.2$, which holds. Therefore, the problem is well-posed and a unique solution exists. The problem statement is valid.\n\nWe proceed to the solution. The no-arbitrage price of the option is its discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure. The price $P_0$ is given by:\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{1}{R} [q P_1(u) + (1-q) P_1(d)] $$\nwhere $P_1(u)$ and $P_1(d)$ are the option payoffs in the up and down states, and $q$ is the risk-neutral probability.\n\nCrucially, the risk-neutral probability $q$ is determined by the tradable underlying asset. Since the policy has altered the asset's payoff structure, the risk-neutral probability must be recalculated based on the new terminal prices $S_1(u)$ and $S_1(d)$. The risk-neutral probability $q$ is the value that makes the expected return on the asset equal to the risk-free rate:\n$$ S_0 R = q S_1(u) + (1-q) S_1(d) $$\nSolving for $q$:\n$$ q = \\frac{R S_0 - S_1(d)}{S_1(u) - S_1(d)} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ q = \\frac{1.05 \\times \\$100 - \\$90}{\\$120 - \\$90} = \\frac{\\$105 - \\$90}{\\$30} = \\frac{\\$15}{\\$30} = 0.5 $$\nThe risk-neutral probability of an up-move is $q=0.5$.\n\nNext, we calculate the payoffs of the European put option at expiration ($t=1$). The payoff is $\\max\\{K-S_1, 0\\}$.\n- Payoff in the up state: $P_1(u) = \\max\\{\\$100 - S_1(u), 0\\} = \\max\\{\\$100 - \\$120, 0\\} = \\$0$.\n- Payoff in the down state: $P_1(d) = \\max\\{\\$100 - S_1(d), 0\\} = \\max\\{\\$100 - \\$90, 0\\} = \\$10$.\n\nFinally, we compute the option's price at $t=0$ by discounting the expected payoff:\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{1}{1.05} [0.5 \\times \\$0 + (1-0.5) \\times \\$10] $$\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{1}{1.05} [0.5 \\times \\$10] = \\frac{\\$5}{1.05} $$\nTo compute the exact fraction, we can write $1.05 = \\frac{105}{100} = \\frac{21}{20}$.\n$$ P_0 = \\$5 \\times \\frac{20}{21} = \\frac{\\$100}{21} \\approx \\$4.761904... $$\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n- **A. $\\$8.571$**: This value, approximately $\\$60/7$, would be the price of the put option in the *absence* of the price floor. In the original model, $q = \\frac{1.05 \\times 100 - 70}{120 - 70} = \\frac{35}{50} = 0.7$. The original payoffs are $P_u=0$ and $P_d = \\max\\{100-70,0\\}=30$. The price would be $P_0 = \\frac{1}{1.05} [0.7 \\times 0 + 0.3 \\times 30] = \\frac{9}{1.05} = \\frac{180}{21} = \\frac{60}{7} \\approx \\$8.571$. The price floor reduces the potential loss for the stock, which must lower the value of a put option. Hence, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **B. $\\$4.762$**: Our calculated price is $P_0 = \\$100/21 \\approx \\$4.7619$. This option, rounded to three decimal places, matches our result. This is **Correct**.\n\n- **C. $\\$2.857$**: This value, approximately $\\$20/7$, results from making a common error: using the original risk-neutral probability ($q=0.7$) with the new option payoffs ($P_1(u)=0, P_1(d)=10$). This calculation would be $P_0 = \\frac{1}{1.05} [0.7 \\times 0 + 0.3 \\times 10] = \\frac{3}{1.05} = \\frac{60}{21} = \\frac{20}{7} \\approx \\$2.857$. This is theoretically inconsistent because the risk-neutral measure must be derived from the actual traded asset's price dynamics, which have been altered by the policy. Hence, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. $\\$14.286$**: This value is much higher than even the original put price. A policy that limits the downside of the underlying cannot increase the value of a put option. This option is logically unsound. Hence, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. The price is not uniquely determined under the policy.**: This would be true if the market became incomplete (i.e., $S_1(u)=S_1(d)$) or if arbitrage were possible. As shown during the validation phase, the new terminal prices are distinct ($\\$120 \\neq \\$90$) and the no-arbitrage condition ($d' < R < u'$) holds. Therefore, a unique no-arbitrage price exists.
