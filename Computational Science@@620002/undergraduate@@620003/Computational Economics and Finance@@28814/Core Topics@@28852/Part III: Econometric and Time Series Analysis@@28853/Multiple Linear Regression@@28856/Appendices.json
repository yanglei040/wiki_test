The data are numerical, and the required calculations are based on established mathematical formulas, not subjective interpretation.\n- The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires fitting a multiple linear regression model using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. The model is of the form:\n$$ \\text{downloads} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{price} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{user\\_rating} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{ad\\_spend} + \\epsilon $$\nIn matrix notation, this is expressed as $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of observed downloads, $\\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the vector of coefficients, and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is the vector of errors.\n\nThe OLS method finds the coefficient vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (SSR), $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\epsilon_i^2$.\n$$ S(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) $$\nTo minimize this quantity, we take the gradient with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = -2\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + 2\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThis yields the normal equations:\n$$ (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} $$\nThe solution for the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is given by:\n$$ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} $$\nThis equation will be solved using numerically stable linear algebra routines.\n\nFirst, we construct the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{train}}$ and the target vector $\\mathbf{y}_{\\text{train}}$ from the $n=12$ training observations. The matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{train}}$ has $k=4$ columns: one for the intercept ($\\beta_0$) and one for each of the three predictors.\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}_{\\text{train}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 31320 \\\\ 24620 \\\\ 25700 \\\\ 29620 \\\\ 30970 \\\\ 17370 \\\\ 27950 \\\\ 23820 \\\\ 21570 \\\\ 36720 \\\\ 21440 \\\\ 21540 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\quad\n\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{train}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0.99  4.5  12000 \\\\\n1  1.99  4.2  8000 \\\\\n1  0.00  3.8  5000 \\\\\n1  2.99  4.7  15000 \\\\\n1  4.99  4.9  20000 \\\\\n1  1.49  3.5  0 \\\\\n1  0.00  4.0  7000 \\\\\n1  3.99  4.4  11000 \\\\\n1  2.49  3.9  6000 \\\\\n1  0.99  4.8  18000 \\\\\n1  1.99  4.1  4000 \\\\\n1  0.49  3.6  2000 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSolving the normal equations for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = [\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1, \\hat{\\beta}_2, \\hat{\\beta}_3]^T$ gives the estimated coefficient vector. Let's proceed to solve the test suite questions.\n\n**1. Prediction Task**\nA new observation is given by the predictor vector $(\\text{price}=1.99, \\text{user\\_rating}=4.5, \\text{ad\\_spend}=10000)$. We form a design vector $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{new}}$ with an intercept:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{new}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1.99  4.5  10000 \\end{pmatrix}^T $$\nThe predicted number of downloads $\\hat{y}_{\\text{new}}$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\hat{y}_{\\text{new}} = \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{new}}^T \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} $$\nThe result is rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n**2. Coefficient Extraction**\nThe estimated coefficient for price, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, is the second element of the vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$. This value is extracted and rounded to $2$ decimal places.\n\n**3. Out-of-sample Goodness-of-Fit**\nThe coefficient of determination for the validation set, $R^{2}_{\\text{test}}$, is computed as:\n$$ R^{2}_{\\text{test}} = 1 - \\frac{SSR_{\\text{test}}}{SST_{\\text{test}}} $$\nwhere $SSR_{\\text{test}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{test}} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$ is the sum of squared residuals on the validation set, and $SST_{\\text{test}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{test}} (y_i - \\bar{y}_{\\text{test}})^2$ is the total sum of squares for the validation set. $\\bar{y}_{\\text{test}}$ is the mean of the observed downloads in the validation data. Predictions $\\hat{y}_i$ are generated using the fitted model: $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_{\\text{test}} = \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{test}}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$. The result is rounded to $4$ decimal places.\n\n**4. Statistical Significance of Price**\nWe test the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$ against the alternative $H_1: \\beta_1 \\neq 0$ using a two-sided Student's t-test. The t-statistic is:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_1 - 0}{SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)} $$\nThe standard error of the coefficient, $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$, is the square root of the corresponding diagonal element of the coefficient covariance matrix, $\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2 (\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{train}}^T \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{train}})^{-1}$. The residual variance, $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$, is an unbiased estimator of the error variance $\\sigma^2$ and is calculated from the training data:\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{SSR_{\\text{train}}}{n-k} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{n-k} $$\nThe degrees of freedom for the t-distribution are $df = n-k = 12-4=8$. We compare the absolute value of the calculated t-statistic, $|t|$, to the critical value $t_{\\text{crit}}$ from the t-distribution for a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $df=8$. If $|t| > t_{\\text{crit}}$, we reject $H_0$, and the coefficient is statistically significant.\n\n**5. Numerical Stability Diagnostic**\nThe spectral condition number of the training design matrix $\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{train}}$ is the ratio of its largest singular value ($\\sigma_{\\max}$) to its smallest singular value ($\\sigma_{\\min}$):\n$$ \\kappa_2(\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{train}}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{\\sigma_{\\min}} $$\nThis value is a measure of multicollinearity in the predictors. A high value indicates potential numerical instability in estimating the coefficients.

In this case, the Gram matrix $X^\\top X$ is a $p \\times p$ positive definite matrix and is therefore invertible. The normal equations have a unique solution given by:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta} = (X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top y $$\n\nIf the columns of $X$ are linearly dependent, the matrix $X$ is rank-deficient, i.e., $r  p$. This situation is known as perfect multicollinearity. The Gram matrix $X^\\top X$ is singular and not invertible. The normal equations are consistent but admit an infinite number of solutions. The problem specifies a unique criterion for selecting a solution in this case: we must choose the minimizer of $S(\\beta)$ that has the smallest Euclidean norm $\\lVert \\beta \\rVert_2$. This specific solution is given by:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta} = X^+ y $$\nwhere $X^+$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $X$. This is the standard solution provided by robust numerical linear algebra routines for least-squares problems.\n\nWe now proceed to analyze each case.\n\n**Case A**\nThe design matrix $X_A$ and response vector $y_A$ are given by:\n$$ X_A=\\begin{bmatrix} 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad y_A=\\begin{bmatrix} 21 \\\\ 19 \\\\ 23 \\\\ 18 \\\\ 22 \\\\ 20 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe columns of $X_A$ correspond to an intercept, a dummy variable for male, and a dummy variable for female. The number of parameters is $p=3$. A linear dependency is immediately apparent: the first column (intercept) is the sum of the second and third columns (male and female dummies). This is the classic \"dummy variable trap\". Due to this multicollinearity, the columns are linearly dependent. The rank of $X_A$, denoted $r_A$, must be less than $p$. Since the second and third columns are linearly independent, the rank is $r_A = 2$.\nAs $r_A  p$, the Gram matrix $X_A^\\top X_A$ is singular, so its invertibility indicator is $0$. The coefficient vector $\\hat{\\beta}_A$ is the minimum-norm solution. The set of all least-squares solutions is defined by the equations $\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\bar{y}_{\\text{male}} = 22$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 = \\bar{y}_{\\text{female}} = 19$. The solution set can be parameterized by $\\beta_0$: $[\\beta_0, 22-\\beta_0, 19-\\beta_0]^\\top$. Minimizing the norm of this vector, $\\beta_0^2 + (22-\\beta_0)^2 + (19-\\beta_0)^2$, yields $\\beta_0 = 41/3$. The corresponding minimum-norm coefficient vector is $\\hat{\\beta}_A = [41/3, 25/3, 16/3]^\\top$.\nNumerically, we find:\n- $r_A = 2$\n- Invertibility indicator: $0$\n- $\\hat{\\beta}_A \\approx [13.6667, 8.3333, 5.3333]$\n\n**Case B**\nThe design matrix $X_B$ and response vector $y_B$ are:\n$$ X_B=\\begin{bmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\\\ 1  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\\\ 1  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad y_B=\\begin{bmatrix} 21 \\\\ 19 \\\\ 23 \\\\ 18 \\\\ 22 \\\\ 20 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nHere, $p=2$. The columns correspond to an intercept and a male dummy. The female category is the reference group. The two columns are linearly independent. Thus, the matrix has full column rank, $r_B = 2 = p$.\nTherefore, $X_B^\\top X_B$ is invertible, and the invertibility indicator is $1$. The unique OLS solution is computed. $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ estimates the mean wage for the reference group (females), and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ estimates the difference between the mean wage of males and females.\nMean female wage: $(\\frac{19+18+20}{3}) = 19$. Thus, $\\hat{\\beta}_0 = 19$.\nMean male wage: $(\\frac{21+23+22}{3}) = 22$. Thus, $\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 22$, which implies $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 22 - 19 = 3$.\n- $r_B = 2$\n- Invertibility indicator: $1$\n- $\\hat{\\beta}_B = [19.0000, 3.0000]$\n\n**Case C**\nThe design matrix $X_C$ and response vector $y_C$ are:\n$$ X_C=\\begin{bmatrix} 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad y_C=\\begin{bmatrix} 21 \\\\ 22 \\\\ 20 \\\\ 23 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe number of parameters is $p=3$. All observations are for males, leading to two forms of perfect multicollinearity. First, the intercept column is identical to the male dummy column. Second, the female dummy column is a zero vector. The column space is spanned by a single vector of ones. The rank is therefore $r_C = 1$.\nSince $r_C  p$, the matrix $X_C^\\top X_C$ is singular, and the invertibility indicator is $0$. We must find the minimum-norm solution. The model effectively tries to estimate the mean wage, $\\bar{y}_C = \\frac{21+22+20+23}{4} = 21.5$, using a linear combination of the predictors. The prediction for any observation is $\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1$. Thus, any solution must satisfy $\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 21.5$. The coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ does not affect the residuals, so for minimum norm it must be $0$. We then minimize $\\beta_0^2 + \\beta_1^2$ subject to $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 = 21.5$, which yields $\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 21.5 / 2 = 10.75$.\n- $r_C = 1$\n- Invertibility indicator: $0$\n- $\\hat{\\beta}_C = [10.7500, 10.7500, 0.0000]$\n\n**Case D**\nThe design matrix $X_D$ and response vector $y_D$ are:\n$$ X_D=\\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad y_D=\\begin{bmatrix} 21 \\\\ 19 \\\\ 23 \\\\ 18 \\\\ 22 \\\\ 20 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThis model omits the intercept and includes a dummy for each category, male and female. The number of parameters is $p=2$. The columns are orthogonal, and thus linearly independent. The matrix has full column rank, $r_D = 2 = p$.\nConsequently, $X_D^\\top X_D$ is invertible (in fact, it is diagonal), and the invertibility indicator is $1$. The unique OLS solution exists. In this parameterization, the coefficients directly estimate the conditional mean for each group.\nThe coefficient for males, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, is the average wage for males: $\\bar{y}_{\\text{male}} = 22$.\nThe coefficient for females, $\\hat{\\beta}_2$, is the average wage for females: $\\bar{y}_{\\text{female}} = 19$.\n- $r_D = 2$\n- Invertibility indicator: $1$\n- $\\hat{\\beta}_D = [22.0000, 19.0000]$", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the OLS problem for four different regression model specifications.\n\n    For each case, it computes:\n    1.

It presents a well-posed and standard econometric exercise for demonstrating the consequences of heteroskedasticity on the inference produced by the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator. The data-generating process is fully specified, the theoretical concepts are sound, and the objectives are clear and quantifiable. The task is to perform a Monte Carlo simulation, which is a fundamental technique in computational statistics and econometrics for evaluating the finite-sample properties of estimators and statistical tests.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the specified linear regression model. For each observation $i=1, \\dots, n$, the model is:\n$$\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{income}_i + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{educ}_i + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\nIn matrix notation, this can be written as $y = X\\beta + \\varepsilon$, where $y$ is the $n \\times 1$ vector of observations on the dependent variable, $X$ is the $n \\times p$ matrix of regressors (with $p=3$), $\\beta$ is the $p \\times 1$ vector of true parameters, and $\\varepsilon$ is the $n \\times 1$ vector of disturbances. The regressor matrix for observation $i$ is $x_i^T = [1, \\text{income}_i, \\text{educ}_i]$.\n\nThe problem specifies two key assumptions about the error term $\\varepsilon$:\n$1$. The exogeneity condition: $E[\\varepsilon \\mid X] = 0$. This ensures that the OLS estimator is unbiased.\n$2$. A specific form of heteroskedasticity: $\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_i \\mid X) = \\sigma_i^2 = \\sigma^2 \\cdot \\text{income}_i$. This means the variance of the error term is not constant but depends on one of the regressors. The full covariance matrix of the error vector is $\\Omega = \\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon \\mid X) = \\operatorname{diag}(\\sigma_1^2, \\dots, \\sigma_n^2)$, which is not proportional to the identity matrix $I_n$.\n\nThe OLS estimator for $\\beta$ is derived by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $S(\\beta) = (y - X\\beta)^T(y - X\\beta)$. The well-known solution is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\n$$\nUnder the exogeneity assumption, this estimator is unbiased, i.e., $E[\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} \\mid X] = \\beta$. However, for valid statistical inference (constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests), we need a consistent estimator for the covariance matrix of $\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS}$. The true covariance matrix of the OLS estimator, conditional on $X$, is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} \\mid X) = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \\Omega X (X^T X)^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe simulation compares two estimators for this covariance matrix.\n\nFirst, the classical, homoskedasticity-only variance estimator. This estimator incorrectly assumes that $\\Omega = \\sigma^2 I_n$. It is given by:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}_{classical}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\hat{s}^2 (X^T X)^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{s}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-p} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{\\varepsilon}_i^2$ is the standard unbiased estimator of the error variance, and $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i = y_i - x_i^T \\hat{\\beta}$ are the OLS residuals. When heteroskedasticity is present, this formula is incorrect, and the resulting standard errors are biased and inconsistent. Confidence intervals constructed using these standard errors will not have the correct nominal coverage probability.\n\nSecond, the Heteroskedasticity-Consistent (HC) variance estimator, specifically the HC0 estimator proposed by White (1980). This estimator does not require the homoskedasticity assumption and provides a consistent estimate of the true covariance matrix. It replaces the unknown $\\Omega$ in the true formula with a diagonal matrix of squared OLS residuals, $\\hat{\\Omega} = \\operatorname{diag}(\\hat{\\varepsilon}_1^2, \\dots, \\hat{\\varepsilon}_n^2)$. The HC0 estimator is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}_{HC0}(\\hat{\\beta}) = (X^T X)^{-1} (X^T \\hat{\\Omega} X) (X^T X)^{-1}\n$$\nThe term $X^T \\hat{\\Omega} X$ is often called the \"sandwich meat\". The standard errors derived from this estimator are \"robust\" to heteroskedasticity of an unknown form. Asymptotically, confidence intervals based on HC standard errors will achieve the correct nominal coverage.\n\nThe simulation will proceed as follows for each test case $(n, \\sigma^2, R)$:\n$1$. The process is repeated for $R$ replications.\n$2$. In each replication, a synthetic dataset $(y, X)$ of size $n$ is generated according to the specified data-generating process with true parameters $(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2) = (1, 0.8, 0.5)$.\n$3$. The model is estimated using OLS to obtain $\\hat{\\beta}$ and the residuals $\\hat{\\varepsilon}$.\n$4$. The standard error for $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is computed using both the classical formula and the HC0 robust formula. This involves taking the square root of the second diagonal element (index $1$) of the respective estimated covariance matrices.\n$5$. Two $95\\%$ confidence intervals for $\\beta_1$ are constructed: $[\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\pm z_{0.975} \\cdot SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)]$, where $z_{0.975}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution ($z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$) and $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$ is the corresponding standard error estimate.\n$6$. For each interval, we check if it contains the true value $\\beta_1 = 0.8$.\n$7$. After all replications, the empirical coverage for each method is calculated as the fraction of intervals that contained the true parameter. These coverages are compared to the nominal level of $0.95$.\nThe expectation is that the empirical coverage of the robust confidence intervals will be close to $0.95$, while the coverage of the classical intervals will deviate significantly, demonstrating their failure under heteroskedasticity.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\ndef run_simulation(n, sigma2, R, true_beta, rng):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a single Monte Carlo simulation for a given parameter set.\n    \"\"\"\n    beta1_true = true_beta[1]\n    num_params = len(true_beta)\n    \n    # Pre-calculate the critical value for 95% CI\n    # z_crit = 1.959964 is norm.ppf(0.975)\n    z_crit = norm.ppf(1 - 0.05 / 2.0)\n\n    # Counters for coverage\n    classical_hits = 0\n    robust_hits = 0\n\n    for _ in range(R):\n        # 1.
