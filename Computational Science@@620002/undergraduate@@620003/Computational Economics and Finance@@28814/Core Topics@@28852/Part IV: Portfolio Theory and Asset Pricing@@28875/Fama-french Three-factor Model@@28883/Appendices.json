The sum of squared residuals from this model is $S_{1}=0.204$.\n\n- A key condition is that $\\mathrm{DY}_{t}$ is linearly independent of the other regressors.\n- The significance level for the test is specified as $5\\%$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the domain of financial econometrics, specifically asset pricing model testing. It is well-posed, providing all necessary information to conduct a hypothesis test on the incremental explanatory power of a variable. The stated conditions and data are self-contained and consistent. No flaws are identified. The problem is therefore valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe question is whether the dividend yield, $\\mathrm{DY}_{t}$, has incremental explanatory power. This is equivalent to testing the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \\gamma = 0$ against the alternative hypothesis $H_{A}: \\gamma \\neq 0$ in the augmented model. The standard procedure for testing such a restriction on nested linear models is the F-test.\n\nThe F-statistic is formulated as:\n$$ F = \\frac{(S_{0} - S_{1}) / q}{(S_{1}) / (T - k_{1})} $$\nwhere:\n- $S_{0}$ is the sum of squared residuals from the restricted model ($0.216$).\n- $S_{1}$ is the sum of squared residuals from the unrestricted model ($0.204$).\n- $q$ is the number of restrictions, which is the difference in the number of parameters between the two models. Here, $q = k_{1} - k_{0} = 5 - 4 = 1$.\n- $T$ is the number of observations ($240$).\n- $k_{1}$ is the number of parameters in the unrestricted model ($5$).\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ F = \\frac{(0.216 - 0.204) / 1}{(0.204) / (240 - 5)} = \\frac{0.012}{0.204 / 235} $$\nCalculation of the F-statistic yields:\n$$ F = \\frac{0.012}{0.000868085...} \\approx 13.8235 $$\n\nThis calculated F-statistic must be compared to the critical value from an F-distribution with $(q, T-k_1)$ degrees of freedom at the specified significance level of $5\\%$. The degrees of freedom are $(1, 235)$.\n\nThe critical value, $F_{c}$, for an F-distribution with $(1, 235)$ degrees of freedom at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ significance level is sought. For large denominator degrees of freedom, the F-distribution with $1$ numerator degree of freedom approaches a chi-squared distribution with $1$ degree of freedom. The $95$th percentile of a $\\chi^2(1)$ distribution is $3.841$. A more precise value for $F_{0.05}(1, 235)$ from statistical tables or software is approximately $3.882$.\n\nWe compare the calculated F-statistic with the critical value:\n$$ F_{calculated} \\approx 13.82 > F_{critical} \\approx 3.882 $$\nSince the calculated F-statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \\gamma = 0$. The result is statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level. This indicates that the addition of the dividend yield variable, $\\mathrm{DY}_{t}$, leads to a statistically significant reduction in the sum of squared residuals. Therefore, $\\mathrm{DY}_{t}$ possesses incremental explanatory power for the asset's excess returns beyond that provided by the Fama-French three-factor model.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. Yes. The reduction in residual variation is statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level, indicating incremental explanatory power for $\\mathrm{DY}_{t}$.\nThis statement is a direct and accurate conclusion from our F-test. The test has confirmed that the reduction in the sum of squared residuals from $S_0=0.216$ to $S_1=0.204$ is statistically significant, which by definition means $\\mathrm{DY}_{t}$ has explanatory power.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. No. The value factor already spans dividend yield, making $\\mathrm{DY}_{t}$ perfectly collinear and non-identifiable in the augmented regression.\nThis statement is factually incorrect based on the problem's premises. The problem explicitly states that \"The dividend yield series $\\mathrm{DY}_{t}$ is linearly independent of the FF3 regressors in the sample.\" This rules out perfect collinearity. If perfect collinearity were present, the OLS estimation of the augmented model would not have been possible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. No. The reduction in residual variation is too small to be statistically distinguishable at the $5\\%$ level given $T=240$.\nThis statement claims the opposite of our finding. The F-test, which is the correct procedure to determine if a reduction in residual variation is \"too small,\" has shown that the reduction is, in fact, statistically significant. The magnitude of the reduction cannot be judged in isolation; it must be evaluated relative to the residual variance and sample size, which is precisely what the F-statistic does. Our calculation proved the reduction is significant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Inconclusive. Because no intercept is included, the test for incremental explanatory power cannot be conducted.\nThis statement is based on a false premise. The problem explicitly states \"Both models include an intercept,\" and the model equations clearly show intercept terms ($\\alpha$ and $\\alpha'$). The parameter counts $k_0=4$ and $k_1=5$ are also consistent with the presence of an intercept.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2392196"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a characteristic that explains returns, such as an ESG score, the next practical step is to construct a tradable portfolio that captures its associated risk premium.

The variances for cases $1$ and $2$ must be identical.\n- For test case $3$, $b_3 = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0.5]^{\\top}$. The variance is $v_3 = b_3^{\\top}Mb_3$.\n- For test case $4$, $b_4 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]^{\\top}$. The target vector is the zero vector.

For a single asset with factor exposures $\\beta_{M}$, $\\beta_{S}$, and $\\beta_{H}$ to the market, Small Minus Big (SMB), and High Minus Low (HML) factors respectively, the conditional expected excess return is assumed to depend on the latent state $S_t \\in \\{1,2\\}$ of the economy through state-dependent factor premia for the SMB and HML factors. Specifically, for each time $t$, the observed excess return $r_t$ is modeled as\n$$\nr_t \\mid S_t=s \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_s, \\sigma^2\\right), \\quad s \\in \\{1,2\\},\n$$\nwith conditional mean\n$$\n\\mu_s \\;=\\; \\beta_{M}\\,\\lambda_{M} \\;+\\; \\beta_{S}\\,\\lambda_{SMB}^{(s)} \\;+\\; \\beta_{H}\\,\\lambda_{HML}^{(s)},\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_{M}$ is the market premium, and $\\lambda_{SMB}^{(s)}$ and $\\lambda_{HML}^{(s)}$ are the state-dependent factor premia for the SMB and HML factors.

This is a classic application of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), for which the forward-pass of the forward-backward algorithm, commonly known as the Hamilton filter, is the standard solution method.\n\nThe model is specified as follows:\nThe observed excess return at time $t$, denoted $r_t$, is drawn from a Gaussian distribution whose parameters depend on a latent state $S_t \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n$$\nr_t \\mid S_t=s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_s, \\sigma^2)\n$$\nThe state-dependent mean $\\mu_s$ is a linear function of three factors, with state-dependent premia for the SMB and HML factors:\n$$\n\\mu_s = \\beta_{M}\\lambda_{M} + \\beta_{S}\\lambda_{SMB}^{(s)} + \\beta_{H}\\lambda_{HML}^{(s)}\n$$\nThe latent state sequence $\\{S_t\\}$ is a first-order Markov chain with a given transition matrix $P$ and an initial state distribution $\\pi_0$ for the state $S_0$. The observations are provided from $t=1$ to $t=T$.\n\nThe objective is to compute the total log-likelihood $\\mathcal{L} = \\log \\mathbb{P}(r_1, \\dots, r_T)$ and the filtered probability $\\mathbb{P}(S_T=1 \\mid r_1, \\dots, r_T)$. This is accomplished by recursively computing the filtered probabilities $\\pi_{t|t} = (\\mathbb{P}(S_t=1 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t), \\mathbb{P}(S_t=2 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t))$, where $\\mathcal{F}_t = \\{r_1, \\dots, r_t\\}$ is the information set at time $t$.\n\nThe Hamilton filter algorithm proceeds iteratively for $t = 1, \\dots, T$:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The process begins at $t=1$. We need the probability distribution of the state $S_1$ before observing $r_1$. This is the predicted probability at $t=1$, conditioned on information at $t=0$ (which is none, observation-wise). The problem specifies the distribution of $S_0$ as $\\pi_0$. The predicted probability vector for $S_1$ is thus $\\pi_{1|0} = \\pi_0 P$, where $P$ is the transition matrix. For the first step of the recursion, we use $\\pi_{0|0} = \\pi_0$.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step ($t=1, \\dots, T$)**: Given the filtered probability from the previous step, $\\pi_{t-1|t-1} = (\\mathbb{P}(S_{t-1}=1 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1}), \\mathbb{P}(S_{t-1}=2 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1}))$, we perform two operations: prediction and update.\n\n    a.  **Prediction Step**: We predict the state probability for time $t$ using the Markov property:\n        $$\n        \\pi_{t|t-1} = \\pi_{t-1|t-1} P\n        $$\n        where $\\pi_{t|t-1}(j) = \\mathbb{P}(S_t=j \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1})$.\n\n    b.  **Update Step**: Upon observing $r_t$, we update our belief about the state $S_t$ using Bayes' theorem.\n        First, we calculate the conditional probability density of the observation $r_t$ for each state $s \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, which we denote $\\eta_s(r_t)$:\n        $$\n        \\eta_s(r_t) = f(r_t \\mid S_t=s) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(r_t - \\mu_s)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n        $$\n        The marginal likelihood of observing $r_t$, given past observations $\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$, is a weighted average of these densities, with weights given by the predicted probabilities:\n        $$\n        f(r_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1}) = \\sum_{s=1}^{2} f(r_t \\mid S_t=s) \\mathbb{P}(S_t=s \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1}) = \\sum_{s=1}^{2} \\eta_s(r_t) \\pi_{t|t-1}(s)\n        $$\n        The log-likelihood of the entire sequence is the sum of the logarithms of these marginal likelihoods for each time step:\n        $$\n        \\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\log f(r_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1})\n        $$\n        Finally, the filtered probability vector $\\pi_{t|t}$ is calculated by updating the predicted probability with the information from $r_t$:\n        $$\n        \\pi_{t|t}(s) = \\mathbb{P}(S_t=s \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t) = \\frac{f(r_t \\mid S_t=s) \\mathbb{P}(S_t=s \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1})}{f(r_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1})} = \\frac{\\eta_s(r_t) \\pi_{t|t-1}(s)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\eta_k(r_t) \\pi_{t|t-1}(k)}\n        $$\n\nThis recursive procedure is applied for $t=1, \\dots, T$. After the final step $t=T$, the accumulated sum is the total log-likelihood $\\mathcal{L}$, and the final filtered probability vector is $\\pi_{T|T}$. The problem requests the first component of this vector, $\\mathbb{P}(S_T=1 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_T)$.\n\nFor Test Case C, we note that the state-dependent means are identical, $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2$. This implies that the conditional densities are also identical, $\\eta_1(r_t) = \\eta_2(r_t)$ for any $r_t$. As a result, the observation $r_t$ provides no information to distinguish between the states. The update step simplifies to $\\pi_{t|t}(s) = \\pi_{t|t-1}(s)$. Consequently, the filtered probabilities evolve solely according to the Markov chain dynamics: $\\pi_{t|t} = \\pi_{t-1|t-1} P$. Since the provided initial distribution $\\pi_0 = (3/7, 4/7)$ is the stationary distribution of the given transition matrix $P$, it follows that $\\pi_{t|t} = \\pi_0$ for all $t$. The final filtered probability $\\mathbb{P}(S_T=1 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_T)$ must therefore be $3/7$. The log-likelihood is simply the sum of log-densities evaluated at a single mean $\\mu = \\mu_1 = \\mu_2$.\n\nThe implementation will follow this logic for each test case, calculating state-dependent means, then iterating through the observations to perform the filter recursion.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the regime-switching Fama-French model problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"betas\": (1.1, 0.4, -0.2), # (beta_M, beta_S, beta_H)\n            \"lambda_M\": 0.006,\n            \"lambda_s1\": (0.004, 0.002), # (lambda_SMB_1, lambda_HML_1)\n            \"lambda_s2\": (-0.001, 0.005), # (lambda_SMB_2, lambda_HML_2)\n            \"sigma\": 0.01,\n            \"P\": np.array([[0.9, 0.1], [0.2, 0.8]]),\n            \"pi0\": np.array([2/3, 1/3]),\n            \"observations\": [0.006, 0.009, 0.004, 0.007, 0.005, 0.008]\n        },\n        {\n            \"betas\": (0.9, 0.7, 0.3),\n            \"lambda_M\": 0.005,\n            \"lambda_s1\": (0.003, 0.001),\n            \"lambda_s2\": (-0.002, -0.001),\n            \"sigma\": 0.008,\n            \"P\": np.array([[0.99, 0.01], [0.02, 0.98]]),\n            \"pi0\": np.array([2/3, 1/3]),\n            \"observations\": [0.0065, 0.0072, 0.0023, 0.0030, 0.0068]\n        },\n        {\n            \"betas\": (1.0, 0.5, 0.5),\n            \"lambda_M\": 0.004,\n            \"lambda_s1\": (0.002, 0.001),\n            \"lambda_s2\": (0.002, 0.001),\n            \"sigma\": 0.012,\n            \"P\": np.array([[0.6, 0.4], [0.3, 0.7]]),\n            \"pi0\": np.array([3/7, 4/7]),\n            \"observations\": [0.0040, 0.0060, 0.0050, 0.0070]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    def run_filter(case):\n        \"\"\"\n        Implements the Hamilton filter for a single test case.\n        \"\"\"\n        beta_m, beta_s, beta_h = case[\"betas\"]\n        lambda_m = case[\"lambda_M\"]\n        lambda_smb1, lambda_hml1 = case[\"lambda_s1\"]\n        lambda_smb2, lambda_hml2 = case[\"lambda_s2\"]\n        sigma = case[\"sigma\"]\n        P = case[\"P\"]\n        pi0 = case[\"pi0\"]\n        observations = case[\"observations\"]\n\n        # Calculate state-dependent means\n        mu1 = beta_m * lambda_m + beta_s * lambda_smb1 + beta_h * lambda_hml1\n        mu2 = beta_m * lambda_m + beta_s * lambda_smb2 + beta_h * lambda_hml2\n        \n        mus = np.array([mu1, mu2])\n\n        total_log_likelihood = 0.0\n        # Initialize filtered probability with pi0 (for state S_0)\n        filtered_prob = pi0\n\n        for r_t in observations:\n            # Prediction step: P(S_t | F_{t-1}) = P(S_{t-1} | F_{t-1}) * P\n            predicted_prob = filtered_prob @ P\n            \n            # Likelihood of observation r_t in each state\n            # eta_s = P(r_t | S_t=s)\n            emission_likelihoods = norm.pdf(r_t, loc=mus, scale=sigma)\n            \n            # Marginal likelihood of observation r_t\n            # f(r_t | F_{t-1})\n            marginal_likelihood = np.dot(predicted_prob, emission_likelihoods)\n            \n            # Update total log-likelihood\n            total_log_likelihood += np.log(marginal_likelihood)\n            \n            # Update step: P(S_t | F_t)\n            # using Bayes' rule: P(S_t | r_t, F_{t-1}) approx P(S_t | F_t)\n            numerator = predicted_prob * emission_likelihoods\n            filtered_prob = numerator / marginal_likelihood\n        \n        final_filtered_prob_s1 = filtered_prob[0]\n        \n        return [round(total_log_likelihood, 6), round(final_filtered_prob_s1, 6)]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        results.append(run_filter(case))\n\n    # Format the output string to match the required format exactly.\n    # The format [l,p] should not have spaces after the comma.\n    formatted_results = [f\"[{res[0]},{res[1]}]\" for res in results]\n    final_output_str = f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\"\n    \n    print(final_output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2392227"}]}
