An asset's equity beta, $\\beta_E$, reflects not only its underlying business risk but also the financial risk introduced by its capital structure. This practice guides you through the essential process of deleveraging beta—calculating a firm's asset beta, $\\beta_A$, from its equity beta—to isolate the company's intrinsic operational risk, independent of its financing decisions. [@problem_id:2390287]", "problem": "A single-business firm is financed with both equity and fixed-rate, interest-bearing debt. An analyst estimates the firm’s equity beta by running a linear regression of the firm’s monthly equity excess returns on the market’s monthly excess returns over a sufficiently long sample and obtains an equity beta estimate of $1.35$. The current market value of equity is $700$ million and the current market value of interest-bearing debt is $300$ million. The statutory corporate tax rate is $0.25$. Assume the firm’s debt beta is approximately $0$ and that the present value of the corporate interest tax shield has the same risk as the debt. Under these conditions, compute the firm’s asset beta (also called the unlevered beta). Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a firm's asset beta, also known as the unlevered beta, which we will denote as $\\beta_A$. This is a measure of the systematic risk of the firm's assets, independent of its capital structure. We are given the firm's equity beta, $\\beta_E$, which reflects the risk to equity holders and is influenced by financial leverage.\n\nThe core principle is that the systematic risk of the firm's assets must equal the weighted-average systematic risk of the claims against those assets. The claims consist of debt and equity. However, with corporate taxes, the use of debt creates an interest tax shield, which is a valuable asset. Therefore, a more complete representation of the firm's value must account for this tax shield.\n\nThe total market value of the levered firm, $V_L$, is the sum of the market value of its equity, $E$, and debt, $D$.\n$$V_L = E + D$$\nThe beta of the levered firm's assets, $\\beta_L$, is the weighted average of the betas of its equity and debt:\n$$\\beta_L = \\frac{E}{E+D}\\beta_E + \\frac{D}{E+D}\\beta_D$$\nThe levered firm's assets can also be decomposed into the unlevered assets (the value of the firm as if it were all-equity financed, $V_U$) and the present value of the interest tax shield, $V_{TS}$.\n$$V_L = V_U + V_{TS}$$\nFrom this perspective, the beta of the levered firm's assets is also a weighted average of the betas of the unlevered assets, $\\beta_U$ (or $\\beta_A$), and the tax shield, $\\beta_{TS}$:\n$$\\beta_L = \\frac{V_U}{V_L}\\beta_U + \\frac{V_{TS}}{V_L}\\beta_{TS}$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\beta_L$ and multiplying by $V_L = E+D$, we obtain the fundamental relationship for the components' betas and values:\n$$E\\beta_E + D\\beta_D = V_U\\beta_U + V_{TS}\\beta_{TS}$$\nThe problem provides crucial simplifying assumptions. First, the firm's debt beta is approximately zero:\n$$\\beta_D \\approx 0$$\nSecond, the present value of the tax shield has the same risk as the debt. This implies their betas are equal:\n$$\\beta_{TS} = \\beta_D$$\nCombining these two assumptions, we conclude that the beta of the tax shield is also zero:\n$$\\beta_{TS} \\approx 0$$\nSubstituting $\\beta_D = 0$ and $\\beta_{TS} = 0$ into our fundamental beta equation:\n$$E\\beta_E + D(0) = V_U\\beta_U + V_{TS}(0)$$\n$$E\\beta_E = V_U\\beta_U$$\nThe asset beta we seek is $\\beta_A = \\beta_U$. To solve for it, we must express $V_U$ in terms of known quantities. From the value decomposition, $V_U = V_L - V_{TS} = (E+D) - V_{TS}$. The value of the tax shield, $V_{TS}$, under the common assumption of perpetual debt, is the tax rate multiplied by the value of debt:\n$$V_{TS} = \\tau_c D$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $V_U$:\n$$V_U = E + D - \\tau_c D = E + D(1-\\tau_c)$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $V_U$ back into our simplified beta equation:\n$$E\\beta_E = (E + D(1-\\tau_c))\\beta_U$$\nSolving for $\\beta_U$, which is the asset beta $\\beta_A$:\n$$\\beta_A = \\beta_U = \\frac{E}{E + D(1-\\tau_c)}\\beta_E$$\nWe are given the following values:\nEquity beta, $\\beta_E = 1.35$\nMarket value of equity, $E = 700$ million\nMarket value of debt, $D = 300$ million\nCorporate tax rate, $\\tau_c = 0.25$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula for the asset beta:\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{700}{700 + 300(1 - 0.25)}\\times 1.35$$\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{700}{700 + 300(0.75)}\\times 1.35$$\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{700}{700 + 225}\\times 1.35$$\n$$\\beta_A = \\frac{700}{925}\\times 1.35$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\beta_A \\approx 0.75675675... \\times 1.35$$\n$$\\beta_A \\approx 1.02162162...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\\beta_A \\approx 1.022$$\nThis result is logical, as the asset beta ($1.022$) must be lower than the equity beta ($1.35$) for a levered firm, reflecting the removal of financial risk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.022}$$", "id": "2390287"}, {"introduction": "Standard beta estimation via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression relies on the assumption of synchronous trading, where asset and market prices are recorded simultaneously.

Formally, for asset $i$ with excess return $R_{i,t}^{e}$ and market excess return $F_{t}$, the model states\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[R_{i,t}^{e}] \\;=\\; \\beta_{i} \\,\\mathbb{E}[F_{t}],\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to the condition that the intercepts $\\alpha_{i}$ in the factor representation\n$$\nR_{i,t}^{e} \\;=\\; \\alpha_{i} \\;+\\; \\beta_{i} \\, F_{t} \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_{i,t}\n$$\nare zero for all $i$.\n\nThe Fama and MacBeth (two-step) approach estimates risk exposures first, then prices them in the cross-section. The principle is to separate time-series risk estimation from cross-sectional pricing, and to exploit the time-series variability of the cross-sectional slope and intercept to form standard errors.\n\nStep-by-step derivation:\n\n1. Time-series estimation of betas. For each asset $i$, consider the regression over the initial window $t=1,\\dots,W$,\n$$\nR_{i,t}^{e} \\;=\\; a_{i} \\;+\\; b_{i} \\, F_{t} \\;+\\; u_{i,t}.\n$$\nThe ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate $b_{i}$ solves\n$$\n\\min_{(a_{i},b_{i})} \\sum_{t=1}^{W} \\left(R_{i,t}^{e} - a_{i} - b_{i} F_{t}\\right)^{2},\n$$\nleading to the normal equations,\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nW & \\sum_{t=1}^{W} F_{t} \\\\\n\\sum_{t=1}^{W} F_{t} & \\sum_{t=1}^{W} F_{t}^{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{i} \\\\\nb_{i}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\;=\\;\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sum_{t=1}^{W} R_{i,t}^{e} \\\\\n\\sum_{t=1}^{W} F_{t} R_{i,t}^{e}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nSolving yields $b_{i} \\equiv \\widehat{\\beta}_{i}$, which is the estimated market exposure for asset $i$. This is the first-principles OLS solution: $b_{i}$ is the slope coefficient in the linear projection of $R_{i,t}^{e}$ on $F_{t}$ and a constant.\n\n2. Cross-sectional pricing each period. For each $t=W+1,\\dots,T$, we treat the set $\\{\\widehat{\\beta}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ as fixed regressors and run the cross-sectional OLS regression across assets,\n$$\nR_{i,t}^{e} \\;=\\; \\gamma_{0,t} \\;+\\; \\gamma_{1,t} \\, \\widehat{\\beta}_{i} \\;+\\; \\eta_{i,t}.\n$$\nStacking over $i$ gives $y_{t} = X \\gamma_{t} + \\eta_{t}$ where $y_{t}$ is the $N \\times 1$ vector of returns $R_{i,t}^{e}$, $X$ is the $N \\times 2$ matrix with first column of ones and second column $\\widehat{\\beta}$, and $\\gamma_{t} = (\\gamma_{0,t},\\gamma_{1,t})^{\\top}$. The OLS estimator is\n$$\n\\widehat{\\gamma}_{t} \\;=\\; (X^{\\top}X)^{-1} X^{\\top} y_{t},\n$$\nyielding $\\widehat{\\gamma}_{0,t}$ (intercept) and $\\widehat{\\gamma}_{1,t}$ (slope) for period $t$.\n\n3. Time-series aggregation and standard errors. With $T_{\\text{cs}} = T - W$ cross-sections, define the sample means\n$$\n\\bar{\\gamma}_{j} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{cs}}} \\sum_{t=W+1}^{T} \\widehat{\\gamma}_{j,t}, \\quad j \\in \\{0,1\\}.\n$$\nThe Fama and MacBeth standard error uses the time-series dispersion of the period-by-period estimates:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{se}}(\\bar{\\gamma}_{j}) \\;=\\; \\frac{s(\\widehat{\\gamma}_{j,\\cdot})}{\\sqrt{T_{\\text{cs}}}},\n$$\nwhere $s(\\widehat{\\gamma}_{j,\\cdot})$ is the sample standard deviation\n$$\ns(\\widehat{\\gamma}_{j,\\cdot}) \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{cs}}-1} \\sum_{t=W+1}^{T} \\left(\\widehat{\\gamma}_{j,t} - \\bar{\\gamma}_{j}\\right)^{2}}.\n$$\nThe $t$-statistic is then\n$$\nt(\\bar{\\gamma}_{j}) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\bar{\\gamma}_{j}}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{se}}(\\bar{\\gamma}_{j})}.\n$$\n\nInterpretation under the CAPM:\n- If the CAPM holds in the data-generating process, then $\\alpha_{i} = 0$ for all $i$, implying $\\bar{\\gamma}_{0}$ should be close to zero, and $t(\\bar{\\gamma}_{0})$ should not statistically differ from zero for sufficiently large $T_{\\text{cs}}$.\n- The slope $\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}$ should be close to $\\mathbb{E}[F_{t}] = \\mu_{M}$, and $t(\\bar{\\gamma}_{1})$ should indicate whether the average price of beta risk is statistically different from zero.\n\nSimulation design and reproducibility:\n- For each case, draws $F_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{M},\\sigma_{M}^{2})$ and $\\varepsilon_{i,t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_{e,i}^{2})$ are generated independently using the stated seed.\n- Excess returns are formed as $R_{i,t}^{e} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i} F_{t} + \\varepsilon_{i,t}$ for $t=1,\\dots,T$.\n- The same $\\widehat{\\beta}_{i}$ estimated from the first $W$ periods are used as regressors for all subsequent cross-sectional regressions.\n\nAlgorithmic implementation from principles:\n- Construct the design matrix for time-series OLS per asset with columns $(\\mathbf{1}, F_{1:W})$ and solve the normal equations using linear algebra to obtain $\\widehat{\\beta}_{i}$.\n- Construct the cross-sectional design matrix with columns $(\\mathbf{1}, \\widehat{\\beta})$ and regress $R_{\\cdot,t}^{e}$ on it for each $t=W+1,\\dots,T$ to obtain $\\widehat{\\gamma}_{0,t}$ and $\\widehat{\\gamma}_{1,t}$.\n- Aggregate to compute $\\bar{\\gamma}_{0}$, $\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}$, and their $t$-statistics as defined.\n- Round each reported number to $6$ decimal places to match the required output precision.\n\nThe final output is the list of three quadruples, one per case,\n$$\n\\left[ \\left[\\bar{\\gamma}_{0}^{A},\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}^{A}, t(\\bar{\\gamma}_{0}^{A}), t(\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}^{A})\\right], \\left[\\bar{\\gamma}_{0}^{B},\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}^{B}, t(\\bar{\\gamma}_{0}^{B}), t(\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}^{B})\\right], \\left[\\bar{\\gamma}_{0}^{C},\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}^{C}, t(\\bar{\\gamma}_{0}^{C}), t(\\bar{\\gamma}_{1}^{C})\\right] \\right],\n$$\nprinted on a single line, where superscripts $A$, $B$, and $C$ index the test cases.
