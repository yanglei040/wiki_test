We must first validate the problem's statement and then provide a thorough solution based on fundamental principles of number theory and statistics.\n\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically well-posed. It concerns the standard LCG recursion $x_{n+1} \\equiv a\\,x_n + c \\pmod{m}$ and investigates the properties of the derived sequences $y_n \\equiv x_n \\pmod{8}$ and $b_n \\equiv x_n \\pmod{2}$. The diagnostics requested—the chi-square statistic, lag-$1$ autocorrelation, and the period of the low-bit sequence—are standard tools for assessing the quality of pseudorandom number generators. The parameters for the test cases are taken from historically significant LCGs, and the problem is completely specified, containing no ambiguities or contradictions. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and we may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests on the behavior of the LCG recursion under the modulo $2^3 = 8$ operation.\n\n**1. Analysis of Determinism for the 3-bit Subsequence ($\\mathrm{isDet3}$)**\n\nThe indicator $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ is true if the sequence of $3$-bit values $y_n = x_n \\pmod{8}$ is autonomous, meaning $y_{n+1}$ is a function of $y_n$ alone.\nThe LCG recursion is $x_{n+1} = (a\\,x_n + c) - q_n m$ for some integer $q_n = \\lfloor (a\\,x_n + c)/m \\rfloor$.\nTaking this equation modulo $8$, we get:\n$$\ny_{n+1} \\equiv x_{n+1} \\pmod{8} \\equiv (a\\,x_n + c - q_n m) \\pmod{8}\n$$\nLet us express $x_n$ in terms of $y_n$: $x_n = 8k + y_n$ for some integer $k$. The value of $k$ depends on the higher-order bits of $x_n$.\nSubstituting this into the congruence gives:\n$$\ny_{n+1} \\equiv (a\\,(8k + y_n) + c - q_n m) \\pmod{8}\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} \\equiv (8ak + a y_n + c - q_n m) \\pmod{8}\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} \\equiv (a y_n + c - q_n m) \\pmod{8}\n$$\nFor $y_{n+1}$ to be a function of $y_n$ only, the expression must be independent of $k$ and $q_n$, which both depend on the full value of $x_n$. The term $a y_n + c$ depends only on $y_n$. The term $q_n m$ introduces a dependency on the higher-order bits of $x_n$, since $q_n$ is a function of $x_n$.\nThis dependency is removed if and only if $q_n m \\pmod{8}$ is constant for all $n$. The simplest way for this to hold for any sequence $x_n$ (and thus any sequence $q_n$) is if $m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$. If $m$ is a multiple of $8$, then $q_n m \\equiv q_n \\cdot 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, regardless of the value of $q_n$.\nIn this case, the recursion for $y_n$ simplifies to:\n$$\ny_{n+1} \\equiv a y_n + c \\pmod{8}\n$$\nThis is a self-contained LCG on the ring of integers modulo $8$, $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIf $m$ is not a multiple of $8$, then $m \\pmod{8}$ is non-zero. The value of $q_n$ can change based on the high bits of $x_n$, which means $q_n m \\pmod{8}$ is not constant. Therefore, $y_{n+1}$ will depend on more than just $y_n$.\n\nThus, the condition for $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ to be true is precisely $m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$.\n\n**2. Period of the 3-bit Subsequence ($P_3$)**\n\nIf $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ is false ($m \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$), $P_3$ is defined to be $0$.\nIf $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ is true, we must find the period of the sequence $y_{n+1} \\equiv a y_n + c \\pmod{8}$, starting from $y_0 = x_0 \\pmod{8}$. Since the state space $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 7\\}$ is finite, this sequence is guaranteed to be periodic. The period can be found by simulating the sequence $y_0, y_1, y_2, \\dots$ and recording the number of steps until $y_0$ is revisited for the first time. The length of the cycle is the period $P_3$.\nFor an LCG on $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$, the maximal period of $2^k$ is achieved if and only if $c$ is odd and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. For our case, $k=3$, this translates to $c$ being odd and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ for a period of $8$.\n\n**3. Chi-Square Statistic ($\\chi^2$)**\n\nThis statistic measures the goodness of fit of the observed frequencies of $y_n$ to a discrete uniform distribution. For $N$ samples and $8$ possible outcomes $\\{0, 1, ..., 7\\}$, the expected frequency for each outcome $j$ is $E_j = N/8$. If $O_j$ is the observed frequency of outcome $j$ in the sequence $y_1, \\dots, y_N$, the statistic is calculated as:\n$$\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{j=0}^{7} \\frac{\\left(O_j - E_j\\right)^2}{E_j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{7} \\frac{\\left(O_j - N/8\\right)^2}{N/8}\n$$\nA small value of $\\chi^2$ (close to $0$) suggests the data is consistent with a uniform distribution, while a large value suggests it is not.\n\n**4. Lag-1 Autocorrelation of the Least Significant Bit ($\\hat{\\rho}_1$)**\n\nThis statistic measures the linear correlation between consecutive elements of the sequence of least significant bits, $b_n = x_n \\pmod{2}$. The formula provided is a variant of the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n$$\n\\hat{\\rho}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} (b_n - \\bar{b})(b_{n+1} - \\bar{b})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} (b_n - \\bar{b})^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} (b_{n+1} - \\bar{b})^2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{b} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N} b_n$ is the mean of the entire sequence $b_1, \\dots, b_N$. A value of $\\hat{\\rho}_1$ close to $0$ indicates low linear correlation, while values near $+1$ or $-1$ indicate strong positive or negative correlation, respectively.\n\n**Analysis of Test Cases:**\n\n- **Case 1:** $m = 2^{31}, a = 1103515245, c = 12345$.\n  - Since $m = 2^{31}$ is a multiple of $8$, $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ is true.\n  - The induced LCG is $y_{n+1} \\equiv a y_n + c \\pmod{8}$. We have $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ and $c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. Since $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $c$ is odd, the period $P_3$ will be maximal, which is $8$.\n  - The sequence $y_n$ will consist of $N/P_3 = 100000/8 = 12500$ repetitions of a permutation of $\\{0, \\dots, 7\\}$. Thus, each value occurs exactly $12500$ times. $O_j = E_j = 12500$, leading to $\\chi^2 = 0$.\n  - The LSB sequence $b_n = y_n \\pmod{2}$ will be periodic. $y_n$ sequence starting from $y_0 = 1$ is $1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, \\dots$. The LSB sequence $b_n$ is $1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, \\dots$. This is a perfectly alternating sequence, which implies a strong negative lag-$1$ autocorrelation, $\\hat{\\rho}_1 \\approx -1$.\n\n- **Case 2:** $m = 2^{31} - 1, a = 16807, c = 0$.\n  - The modulus $m$ is a prime number and is not a multiple of $8$. Thus, $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ is false, and $P_3 = 0$.\n  - The low-order bits $y_n$ are not determined by a simple local recursion but are mixed by the global operation modulo a large prime. We expect these bits to behave pseudo-randomly.\n  - $\\chi^2$ should be a small positive value, characteristic of random sampling fluctuations.\n  - $\\hat{\\rho}_1$ should be close to $0$, indicating low correlation between consecutive bits.\n\n- **Case 3:** $m = 2^{48}, a = 25214903917, c = 11$.\n  - Similar to Case 1, $m = 2^{48}$ is a multiple of $8$, so $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ is true.\n  - The induced LCG is $y_{n+1} \\equiv a y_n + c \\pmod{8}$. We find $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ and $c \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$. Again, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $c$ is odd, so the period $P_3$ is $8$.\n  - As in Case 1, the perfect periodicity implies $O_j = N/8$, so $\\chi^2 = 0$.\n  - The LSB sequence $b_n = y_n \\pmod{2}$ will also be periodic. For $y_0=1$, the sequence is $1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, \\dots$. The LSB sequence is again $1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, \\dots$. Thus, we expect $\\hat{\\rho}_1 \\approx -1$.\n\nThis analysis shows a fundamental weakness of LCGs with power-of-two moduli: their low-order bits are highly non-random, having very short periods. This is why such generators must be used with caution, and often their output is truncated to use only the higher-order bits.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\nThe implementation will follow the logic above. A loop will iterate through the test cases. For each case, we will:\n1.  Generate $N$ values of $x_n$ using the LCG recursion. Python's arbitrary-precision integers will handle large intermediate products.\n2.  Compute the $y_n$ and $b_n$ sequences.\n3.  Compute $\\chi^2$ by counting occurrences of each value in $y_n$ and applying the formula.\n4.  Compute $\\hat{\\rho}_1$ directly from the provided formula using the $b_n$ sequence.\n5.  Determine $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ by checking if $m \\pmod{8} == 0$.\n6.  If $\\mathrm{isDet3}$ is true, compute $P_3$ by iterating the map on $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ until the initial state is revisited. Otherwise, set $P_3 = 0$.\nThe results will be collected and printed in the specified format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_diagnostics(m, a, c, x0, N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates LCG sequences and computes statistical diagnostics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use standard Python integers which support arbitrary size.\n    # This is crucial for Case 3 where intermediate products exceed 64 bits.\n    x = np.zeros(N + 1, dtype=object)\n    x[0] = x0\n\n    # Generate N consecutive states x_1, ..., x_N\n    for n in range(N):\n        x[n+1] = (a * x[n] + c) % m\n\n    # The problem asks for analysis on x_1, ..., x_N\n    x_sequence = x[1:].astype(np.int64)\n\n    # Compute y_n and b_n sequences\n    y_n = x_sequence % 8\n    b_n = x_sequence % 2\n\n    # 1.

This exercise illuminates the fundamental difference between statistical PRNGs and cryptographically secure PRNGs (CSPRNGs) by tasking you with \"cracking\" a simple LCG from a few of its outputs [@problem_id:2423284]. Successfully predicting the LCG sequence—and failing to do so for a modern CSPRNG—provides a powerful, hands-on demonstration of what makes a generator truly unpredictable and suitable for sensitive applications.", "problem": "You are given two classes of generators that are used to produce discrete uniform variates in computational economics and finance: a linear congruential generator and a cryptographically secure generator constructed from a cryptographic hash in counter mode. Your task is to implement a predictor that, after passively observing three consecutive outputs of a generator, attempts to predict the next output. The predictor should succeed for the linear congruential generator and fail for the cryptographically secure generator.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- A linear congruential generator (LCG) is defined by the recurrence\n$$X_{t+1} \\equiv a X_t + c \\pmod{m},$$\nwith state $X_t \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$, modulus $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, multiplier $a \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$, increment $c \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$, and an initial seed $X_0$. It produces discrete uniform variates by mapping $U_t = X_t/m \\in [0,1)$.\n- The cryptographically secure generator used here is specified as follows: let $H$ be the Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit hash function (SHA-256). For a given byte-string seed $s$ and a prime modulus $m$, define\n$$X_t \\equiv \\mathrm{int}\\big(H(s \\,\\|\\, \\mathrm{encode}_{8}(t))\\big) \\bmod m,$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{encode}_{8}(t)$ is the $8$-byte big-endian encoding of the nonnegative integer $t$, $\\|$ denotes concatenation, and $\\mathrm{int}(\\cdot)$ interprets the $32$-byte hash output as a nonnegative integer in base $256$. This construction is a standard counter-based pseudorandom number generator using a cryptographic primitive, and its outputs are intended to be computationally unpredictable.\n\nYour program must implement the following:\n1. A function that, given a modulus $m$ and three consecutive observed states $(x_0,x_1,x_2)$ from a single generator, attempts to infer parameters $(a,c)$ consistent with the LCG definition and predict the next state $\\hat{x}_3 \\equiv a x_2 + c \\pmod{m}$. If multiple $(a,c)$ satisfy the congruences with the given observations or if modular inversion is impossible in your method, you may choose any consistent rule, but you must return a single integer prediction $\\hat{x}_3 \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m-1\\}$.\n2. For each test case, compute the true next state $x_3$ using the specified ground-truth generator. Report whether your predictor’s $\\hat{x}_3$ equals the true $x_3$ as a boolean.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case A (LCG, happy path): $m = 2147483647$, $a = 48271$, $c = 0$, $X_0 = 12345$.\n- Case B (LCG, nonzero increment): $m = 1000003$, $a = 35011$, $c = 7919$, $X_0 = 424242$.\n- Case C (LCG, boundary where $a = 1$): $m = 101$, $a = 1$, $c = 1$, $X_0 = 17$.\n- Case D (cryptographically secure generator): prime modulus $m = 4294967291$, seed $s$ equal to the ASCII byte-string of the text “econ-secure”. The generator is $X_t \\equiv \\mathrm{int}\\big(H(s \\,\\|\\, \\mathrm{encode}_{8}(t))\\big) \\bmod m$ with $H$ being SHA-256.\n\nFor each case, proceed as follows:\n- Generate the first four consecutive states $X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3$ using the specified ground-truth generator and parameters.\n- Give the predictor only $(m, X_0, X_1, X_2)$ and let it compute $\\hat{X}_3$ by fitting an LCG as per item $1$ above.\n- Compute a boolean $b$ that is $\\mathrm{True}$ if $\\hat{X}_3 = X_3$ and $\\mathrm{False}$ otherwise.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of booleans enclosed in square brackets (e.g., “[True,False,True,False]”), in the order Case A, Case B, Case C, Case D.\n\nNotes and requirements:\n- All quantities are dimensionless counts; no physical units are involved.\n- Angles are not involved.\n- Do not use percentage signs; no percentages are required.\n- Design your predictor strictly from the definitions provided. Do not hard-code the answers.\n- Ensure your program is self-contained and does not read any input.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the fields of number theory and cryptography, is well-posed with a clear and achievable objective, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction. It correctly frames a fundamental dichotomy between statistically random sequences, which may be predictable, and cryptographically secure sequences, which are designed to be unpredictable. We shall therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe task is to differentiate between a linear congruential generator (LCG) and a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) by attempting to predict the next term in a sequence after observing three consecutive terms. The success or failure of this prediction serves to classify the generator.\n\nThe LCG is defined by the linear recurrence relation:\n$$X_{t+1} \\equiv a X_t + c \\pmod{m}$$\nwhere $a$ is the multiplier, $c$ is the increment, and $m$ is the modulus. This linear structure is its critical vulnerability. Given three observed consecutive states, $x_0$, $x_1$, and $x_2$, we can construct a system of two linear congruences with two unknowns, a and c:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_1 \\equiv a x_0 + c \\pmod{m} \\\\\nx_2 \\equiv a x_1 + c \\pmod{m}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo solve for the unknown parameters, we first eliminate $c$ by subtracting the first congruence from the second:\n$$x_2 - x_1 \\equiv (a x_1 + c) - (a x_0 + c) \\pmod{m}$$\n$$x_2 - x_1 \\equiv a (x_1 - x_0) \\pmod{m}$$\nLet $\\Delta_0 = x_1 - x_0$ and $\\Delta_1 = x_2 - x_1$. The congruence simplifies to $\\Delta_1 \\equiv a \\Delta_0 \\pmod{m}$. We can solve for $a$ by multiplying by the modular multiplicative inverse of $\\Delta_0$ modulo $m$. This inverse, $\\Delta_0^{-1}$, exists if and only if $\\text{gcd}(\\Delta_0, m) = 1$. The test cases utilize prime moduli $m$, for which this condition holds unless $\\Delta_0$ is a multiple of $m$, i.e., $x_1 \\equiv x_0 \\pmod{m}$. Assuming $x_1 \\not\\equiv x_0 \\pmod{m}$, we find a unique solution for the multiplier $\\hat{a}$:\n$$\\hat{a} \\equiv \\Delta_1 \\cdot (\\Delta_0 \\pmod m)^{-1} \\pmod{m}$$\nOnce $\\hat{a}$ is determined, we substitute it back into the first congruence to solve for the increment $\\hat{c}$:\n$$\\hat{c} \\equiv x_1 - \\hat{a} x_0 \\pmod{m}$$\nHaving recovered the parameters $(\\hat{a}, \\hat{c})$, we can predict the next state, $\\hat{x}_3$, using the LCG recurrence:\n$$\\hat{x}_3 \\equiv \\hat{a} x_2 + \\hat{c} \\pmod{m}$$\nIf the observed sequence was indeed produced by an LCG, our recovered parameters $(\\hat{a}, \\hat{c})$ will be identical to the generator's true parameters, and our prediction $\\hat{x}_3$ will equal the true state $X_3$.\n\nThe cryptographically secure generator, in contrast, is designed to make such prediction computationally infeasible. Its definition is:\n$$X_t \\equiv \\mathrm{int}\\big(H(s \\,\\|\\, \\mathrm{encode}_{8}(t))\\big) \\bmod m$$\nHere, $H$ is the SHA-$256$ cryptographic hash function. The output $X_t$ is a complex, non-linear transformation of a simple counter $t$. There is no simple algebraic relationship between consecutive terms $X_t$ and $X_{t+1}$. While our predictor can still be applied to a sequence from this generator—it will always find some LCG parameters $(\\hat{a}, \\hat{c})$ that fit any three points $(x_0, x_1, x_2)$ (provided $x_1 \\not\\equiv x_0 \\pmod m$)—these parameters are mere artifacts. They describe a line passing through three effectively random points and have no bearing on the underlying generation process. The true next state, $X_3$, is determined by an independent evaluation of the hash function at $t=3$. The probability that our prediction $\\hat{x}_3$ matches $X_3$ is vanishingly small, approximately $1/m$.\n\nThus, our algorithm will generate the true sequence $(X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3)$ for each test case, apply the LCG predictor to $(X_0, X_1, X_2)$ to compute $\\hat{X}_3$, and report whether $\\hat{X}_3 = X_3$. We expect a positive result for all LCG cases and a negative result for the CSPRNG case, thereby demonstrating the principle of unpredictability.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport hashlib\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the prediction tests and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Case A (LCG, happy path)\",\n            \"type\": \"lcg\",\n            \"m\": 2147483647,\n            \"a\": 48271,\n            \"c\": 0,\n            \"x0\": 12345,\n            \"seed\": None,\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Case B (LCG, nonzero increment)\",\n            \"type\": \"lcg\",\n            \"m\": 1000003,\n            \"a\": 35011,\n            \"c\": 7919,\n            \"x0\": 424242,\n            \"seed\": None,\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Case C (LCG, boundary where a = 1)\",\n            \"type\": \"lcg\",\n            \"m\": 101,\n            \"a\": 1,\n            \"c\": 1,\n            \"x0\": 17,\n            \"seed\": None,\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Case D (cryptographically secure generator)\",\n            \"type\": \"csg\",\n            \"m\": 4294967291,\n            \"a\": None,\n            \"c\": None,\n            \"x0\": None,\n            \"seed\": b\"econ-secure\",\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Generate the ground-truth sequence of 4 states (X0, X1, X2, X3)\n        if case[\"type\"] == \"lcg\":\n            true_sequence = generate_lcg_sequence(\n                case[\"m\"], case[\"a\"], case[\"c\"], case[\"x0\"], 4\n            )\n        elif case[\"type\"] == \"csg\":\n            true_sequence = generate_csg_sequence(case[\"m\"], case[\"seed\"], 4)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Unknown generator type: {case['type']}\")\n\n        x0, x1, x2, x3_true = true_sequence\n\n        # Predict the next state assuming an LCG model\n        x3_pred = predict_next_lcg(case[\"m\"], x0, x1, x2)\n\n        # Compare the prediction with the true state\n        results.append(x3_pred == x3_true)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef generate_lcg_sequence(m, a, c, x0, count):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a sequence of numbers from a Linear Congruential Generator.\n    X_{t+1} = (a * X_t + c) % m\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    x_current = x0\n    for _ in range(count):\n        sequence.append(x_current)\n        x_current = (a * x_current + c) % m\n    return sequence\n\ndef generate_csg_sequence(m, seed, count):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a sequence from a SHA-256 counter-based generator.\n    X_t = int(SHA256(seed || encode_8(t))) % m\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    for t in range(count):\n        t_bytes = t.to_bytes(8, 'big')\n        data_to_hash = seed + t_bytes\n        h = hashlib.sha256(data_to_hash).digest()\n        int_hash = int.from_bytes(h, 'big')\n        x_t = int_hash % m\n        sequence.append(x_t)\n    return sequence\n\ndef predict_next_lcg(m, x0, x1, x2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the next state (x3) from three previous states (x0, x1, x2)\n    by inferring the parameters of an LCG.\n    \"\"\"\n    # System to solve for a_hat, c_hat:\n    # x1 = a*x0 + c (mod m)\n    # x2 = a*x1 + c (mod m)\n    # Subtracting gives: x2 - x1 = a * (x1 - x0) (mod m)\n    \n    delta0 = (x1 - x0) % m\n    delta1 = (x2 - x1) % m\n\n    try:\n        # To solve a_hat * delta0 = delta1 (mod m), we need the modular inverse of delta0.\n        # pow(base, -1, mod) computes this efficiently.\n        inv_delta0 = pow(delta0, -1, m)\n        a_hat = (delta1 * inv_delta0) % m\n    except ValueError:\n        # This occurs if gcd(delta0, m) != 1.
